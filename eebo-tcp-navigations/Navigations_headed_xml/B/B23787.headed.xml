<HEAD>The present State of CHINA.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>N the Thirtieth day of <HI>January,</HI> 1665. I went in the company of Mr. <HI>Carlos Daty,</HI> to visit Father <HI>John Grueber</HI> at his arrival from <HI>Constantinople.</HI> About two years since, he came out of <HI>China,</HI> where he had resided full three years. He began his pilgrimage at <HI>Venice,</HI> where he took shipping for <HI>Smyrna;</HI> from thence, by Land, he marched to <HI>Ormus</HI> in five moneths; from thence to <HI>Macao</HI> in seven; so from the South Coast he travelled to the
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>North, through the large Empire o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>China,</HI> sometimes upon Rivers an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> commodious Channels, and some∣times by Land, and at last he go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> safe to the City of <HI>Pekin.</HI> In his re∣turn from thence, he adventured t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pass, and survey a Countrey whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was never yet seen before, by any i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Europe;</HI> namely, The unfruitful Sands of the Desarts of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> which he passed over in three days, and came to the Coast of an Inland Sea called <HI>Kokonor,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Kokonor</HI> in <HI>Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tarty.</HI> sig∣nifies Great Sea.</NOTE> not much un∣like to the <HI>Caspian.</HI> The River <HI>Jannus</HI> that runs through <HI>China</HI> with a strange rapidity, &amp; discharges it self into the Oriental Sea, near the Island of <HI>Carea,</HI> hath here its source. This River is the deep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st and largest of all that Countr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Afterwards this adventurous Tra∣veller, lost the sight of the Sea to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣ter further into the Land, into the Province of <HI>Toktokai,</HI> which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/>barren and wild, that one of the Neighboring people can have any temptation to dispossess the antient Inhabitants. Nothing is there re∣markable, but only some few dis∣persed Tents of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who lead a most miserable life.</P>
<P>The beautiful River <HI>Toktokai,</HI> which is as large as <HI>Danubinus,</HI> but so shallow, that any Man, on Horse∣back, may ford it over in the deepest place, watereth this blessed Coun∣trey, and gives unto it a name. From hence our Traveller passed through the Province of <HI>Tangut,</HI> which is very populous and belongs to the Kingdom of <HI>Barantola;</HI> he visited, in his way, the City of <HI>Retink,</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Barantola,</HI> the <HI>Me∣tropolis</HI> is called <HI>Lassa,</HI> and the pre∣sent King <HI>Teva.</HI> He is of a very an∣tient and noble Family of the <HI>Tar∣tars</HI> of <HI>Tangut.</HI> His ordinary re∣sidence is at <HI>Butala,</HI> a lofty Castle built according to the <HI>European</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="4"/>mode upon a high Hill, having Buildings of four stories, of very good and regular workmanship. The Court of this Prince is numerous, and his attendants are extream lavish in their apparel, which is, for the most part, of Cloath of Gold, and of embroidered Stuffs. Neverthe∣less this Nation is generally very sluttish, and unhandsome in their attire: Neither Men nor Women wear lining next to their skin. Their common Bed is the ground, their ordinary food is raw Flesh, and they are not so scrupulous to wash their hands or faces; but they appear very kind and courteous to stran∣gers. Their Women have the liber∣ty to walk about the Streets, as amongst the other <HI>Tartars;</HI> but their other Customs are like to those of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>Their Arch-Priest or Mufty is called <HI>Lamacongiù,</HI> whom they re∣verence as God, and believe to be
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>related to their first King, but they name him the Brother of all the the Kings of the World. They are perswaded that he riseth from the dead as often as he dies, and that this Man hath already risen seven times. The Kings and Polititians of that Countrey labor, by subtil means, to entertain the common people, in this strange belief, and the <HI>Lamacongiu</HI> himself contributes to it; for he keeps his face always covered, and suffers none to look upon it, but such as are acquainted with the mystery. The Nobility do mightily respect him; some of them come to that point of adoration, as to covet that which is incredible, and to carry it about as a sacred relick: From <HI>Barantola,</HI> Father <HI>Grueber</HI> tra∣velled to the Kingdom of <HI>Nekpal,</HI> and in a moneths time passed through it. The two principal Towns are <HI>Catmandir</HI> and <HI>Patan,</HI> situate on the Banks of a River op∣posite
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>to one another. This latter is a young Prince very well accom∣plished; he commands all the <HI>Militia</HI> of the Kingdom as General. When Father <HI>Grueber</HI> was there, he was at the head of a great Army marching against a Neighboring King called <HI>Varcam,</HI> who made frequent inroads to spoil the Countrey. The Jesuites gave this young Prince a Prospective Glass, through which he caused him to look at a place where <HI>Varcam's</HI> Army lay encamped; he found it so nigh, that he gave order presently to make ready and prepare for the fight, for he perceived not that this propinquity was but an effect of the Glass. This present was acceptable to him.</P>
<P>From <HI>Nekpal</HI> our Traveller went, in five days, to the Kingdom of <HI>Mo∣ranga,</HI> where he could see no City, but only small Houses covered with Straw, and little Huts, one appoint∣ed for a Custom-Housse. The King
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>of <HI>Moranga</HI> pays a yearly tribute of 250000 Rixdollers, and seven Ele∣phants to the <HI>Mogol.</HI> From <HI>Mo∣ranga</HI> he travelled into that part of <HI>India</HI> which is beyond the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> and came to <HI>Minapor,</HI> the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of that Countrey; where he passed over that River, which is twice as big as the <HI>Danubius.</HI> From thence he went to <HI>Patan;</HI> and from that City, in five and twenty days, to <HI>Agra,</HI> the Royal City of that part of <HI>India,</HI> which is on this side <HI>Ganges.</HI> From thence to <HI>Laor</HI> in fourteen days. This City is built upon the Banks of the River <HI>Ravi,</HI> which is as large as <HI>Danubius,</HI> it runs into <HI>India,</HI> near <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ltaia.</HI> There he took Boat and was carried down the River, in forty days to <HI>Tata,</HI> the ut∣most City of <HI>Indostan,</HI> the ordinary residence of the Viceroy of that Countrey; his name is <HI>Laskarkan,</HI> there he met with many <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Marchants.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
<P>From this place he sailed to <HI>Or∣muz</HI> by Sea, from <HI>Ormuz</HI> he went to <HI>Persia,</HI> afterwards he returned back to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> where he took shipping and arrived safe at <HI>Messina;</HI> from thence he went to <HI>Rome,</HI> where he received an express command to go back again to <HI>China.</HI> For that pur∣pose he travelled into <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Polonia,</HI> hoping to find another way through <HI>Muscovia.</HI> By the Emperors procurement, he had got Pasports from the Dukes of <HI>Curland</HI> and <HI>Muscovia.</HI> But when he was so far on his way as the Borders of <HI>Mus∣covia,</HI> he understood that the King of <HI>Poland</HI> and the <HI>Tartars</HI> had made a conjuction of their Forces, with an intent to attempt upon the Duke of <HI>Muscovia.</HI> By this means he was diverted in his passage to <HI>Musco;</HI> for the fear of the dangers and diffi∣culties in time of War, brought him back to <HI>Vienna,</HI> where he arrived at a convenient time when the Empe∣ror
<PB N="9" REF="6"/>was dispatching an Ambassador, Count <HI>Leshley</HI> by name, to <HI>Constan∣tinople.</HI> The Jesuite took this op∣portunity to travel thither with a resolution, from thence to go for∣ward in his intended journey: But when he came to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> he was mightily incommoded with a great rheume, with shortness of breath, and with violent pains in his stomach; so that being not able to proceed on in his journey, he went aboard a Ship bound for <HI>Le∣gorne;</HI> from whence he was carried to <HI>Florence,</HI> where he remained a∣bout eight days. In this time he was pretty well recovered of his distemper, so that he could go after∣wards to <HI>Venice;</HI> from whence he passed through <HI>Friuli</HI> to <HI>Vienna,</HI> with an intent, by that way, to re∣turn to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> that he might travel afterwards to <HI>China,</HI> accord∣ing to the orders of his General.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="7"/>
<P>This Father is about forty five years of age, of a jovial temper, ex∣traordinary civil, as sincere as a <HI>Ger∣man,</HI> his conversation is very plea∣sant; in a word, he hath so many good qualities, and is so gallant a Man, that though he were not a Jesuite, all the World would esteem and love him.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Carlos Dati</HI> had seen him, the day before we had any dis∣course with him, in the With-draw∣ing Room of Prince <HI>Leopold,</HI> where he was entered into a conversation with him, which lasted not long; for the Father was called away and introduced into his Highnesses pre∣sence. After this first acquaintance, he intreated him to give him satis∣faction to some questions that he had a desire to make him concern∣ing <HI>China,</HI> which request the Father granted in an obliging manner.</P>
<P>First, Mr. <HI>Dati</HI> desired to know, whether the present King of <HI>China</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>is the Son of the last Conqueror of that Kingdom? Where he kept his Court? Whether in <HI>China?</HI> or in <HI>Tartaria?</HI> The Father answered, that he was but his Grandchild; for the Grandfather being invited and brought in by the Rebellious Eu∣nuchs in the year 1646. He con∣quered all <HI>China,</HI> as Father <HI>Marti∣nius</HI> hath written at large in his History of <HI>China.</HI> He told us, that the present King of that Countrey is about twelve or thirteen years of age; that he resides at <HI>Pekin,</HI> the cheif City of the Kingdom, that his Father and Grandfather also did dwell there, according to <HI>Ma∣chiavels</HI> Rule; for he adviseth a Prince when he intends to keep in his hands a Countrey newly sub∣dued to his Scepter, where the In∣habitants differ from him in Lan∣guage, Customs, and Laws, to go and make there his abode. This is a Policy not so subtil, but that the
<PB N="12" REF="8"/><HI>Tartarians</HI> have very well under∣stood and practised it.</P>
<P>We inquired next, what kind of <HI>Militia</HI> they had? And how the <HI>Chineses</HI> were treated by their <HI>Tar∣tarian</HI> Kings?</P>
<P>He told us, that the most part of the Soldiers of the Kingdom were <HI>Tartars,</HI> unless it be the Kings Guard which is a Body of about 40000 Men armed with Muskets and Bows of <HI>Corea</HI> or <HI>Japonia,</HI> for the most part. That the Inhabitants were not oppressed with Taxes, nor treated worse then by their former Kings; for they have all kind of Liberty and Freedom of Religion. The antient Laws are yet maintained in force all over the Countrey, and Justice is administred by Judges that are natural <HI>Chineses,</HI> only there is this alteration, a <HI>Tartarian</HI> must ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st in every Court with a limited Autho∣rity, which suffers him to alter no∣thing of the antient Customs and Laws of the Countrey.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>
<P>We desired him to tell us, what manner of Government they had under the King?</P>
<P>At <HI>Pekin,</HI> replied the Father, there are nine Judges or Courts of Judicature; and so it is in all other Cities of the Kingdom, where they are called by the same names, and hear the same causes.</P>
<P>The first and highest Court is called <HI>Li-pú,</HI> where half are <HI>Chineses,</HI> and half are <HI>Tartars.</HI> It judges all Causes proceeding out of other Courts of the Kingdom, by way of Appeal, of what nature or business soever. The second is named also <HI>Li-pù,</HI> but here the syllable <HI>Li</HI> is pronounced in a different manner from the first, for in the former it sig∣nifies <HI>Reason;</HI> but in this latter word it imports <HI>Ceremony.</HI> This Court is the <HI>Forum Ecclesiasticum</HI> that judges of all differences be∣tween the Learned; and decides all matters of controversie in Religion.
<PB N="14" REF="9"/>The third is stiled <HI>Pim-pù,</HI> which examines the affairs of the <HI>Militia.</HI> The fourth is for offenders, or the Criminal Court called <HI>Nim-pù.</HI> The fift is named <HI>Cho-pù,</HI> appointed for the Kings Treasury, as the <HI>Exchequer</HI> is amongst us. The sixth is <HI>Cum-pù,</HI> which hath a care of all the Kings Buildings and publick Structures, and Edifices. The seventh is to see to the payment of all the Kings Of∣ficers and Attendants in his Family. The eighth hath an inspection over the Kings Kitchin and Table. The Father had forgot the names of the two latter Courts, and of the busi∣nesses examined in the other.</P>
<P>In every City, these nine Courts are erected subordinate to one an∣other; for example, that of one City, appointed for the <HI>Militia,</HI> is under the jurisdiction of the Pro∣vincial Court, which is in the cheif City of the Province; and from that, and all others, Men appeal
<PB N="15" REF="9"/>to the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of the Kingdom for the <HI>Militia,</HI> from whence they may appeal to the highest Court, which is the <HI>Li-pù,</HI> when it is a business of great importance.</P>
<P>From this Tribunal, there can be no appeal further, but to the Kings person, which is never granted without the punishment of one hun∣dred bastinadoes, which every one must patiently endure before he can be admitted to the Kings presence. The manner of giving them is very cruel; the poor wretch is forced to lye down upon the ground, upon his Belly, with his middle and back∣side naked, two men sit one against another upon his Neck and Legs, with two great <HI>Indian</HI> Canes in their hands attempered before in wa∣ter, that they might be more pliable, then they strike one after another; he that sits at the Head, strikes up∣on the Hips, and the other upon the Back, one after another so fast,
<PB N="16" REF="10"/>that they are forced to stop some∣times, and suffer the patient to breathe; for otherwise they would beat the breath out of his Body. The <HI>Mandarins,</HI> that is to say, the Noblemen of the Countrey, and the <HI>Tartars,</HI> do commonly inflict this kind of punishment upon their servants, for the least offence. He that is forced to undergo this misery before he can come into the Kings presence, proceeds in this manner. He is to cast in a stone at the Kings Chamber Window, then he is com∣manded to come in; and if the King perceives that he suffers brave∣ly the first bastinadoes in such a manner, that declares his cause to be just, and the greatness of his op∣pression, he commands the Execu∣tioners to forbear, and the party to relate his business. If it appears then, that any injustice hath been done him, all that have had any hand in the judging of the matter
<PB N="17" REF="10"/>before, are happy if they are dis∣charged, only for the loss of their Offices; for commonly they are condemned to die.</P>
<P>I asked the Father, whether there were none left of the Race of the last Kings that reigned in <HI>China.</HI> For Monsieur <HI>Dati</HI> said, that some affirm that a Son of the former King of <HI>China</HI> had escaped into an ad∣jacent Island where he doth now live.</P>
<P>The Father assured us, that if we did but consider where that Island was situate, that it was enough to convince us of the fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hood of that report: For it is in the Oriental part of <HI>China,</HI> therefore in such a case the Prince was to pass and tra∣vel many moneths through the whole Body of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Army, and conquered Territories, for they were come that way into <HI>China;</HI> which is a thing not possible to be performed. The King his
<PB N="18" REF="11"/>Father that reigned then, was be∣come effeminate by his lascivious behavior. He seldom shewed him∣self out of his Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, more then once a year, leaving the Govern∣ment of the Kingdom and Army, to 10000 treacherous Eunuchs that had called in the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who had subdued three whole Provinces, and besieged the City of <HI>Pekin</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound about, before the King knew any thing of their attempts upon his Government.</P>
<P>This sudden approach and sur∣prise, cast him into such a despair, that he resolved to die. In order to it, he writ with his own blood upon a Busquin of white Damask these words. <HI>God preserve the new King, let him not trust my Counsel∣lors, but let him take compassion of my people.</HI> After this he hanged one of his Daughters, and then hanged himself under the door that leads into the Garden of his Pallace. The
<PB N="19" REF="11"/>Queen also died in the same manner, but her Son and another of her Daughters were taken by the <HI>Tar∣tars,</HI> and shut up in a prison where they died also.</P>
<P>We inquired of what Family were the antient Kings of <HI>China?</HI> and the Kings that now reign, of what House they are?</P>
<P>He informed us, that the antient Kings of <HI>China,</HI> were of the Family called <HI>Min,</HI> which signifies <HI>Light.</HI> Monsieur <HI>Dati</HI> replied, wherefore then doth Father <HI>Martinius</HI> in his History call their Family <HI>Taimin? Tai</HI> answered Father <HI>Grueber,</HI> signi∣fies Stock or Race; so that the meaning of <HI>Taimin</HI> is the Race of <HI>Min,</HI> as we say the Race, or the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> or the House of <HI>Arragon.</HI> But he told us, that the <HI>Tartars</HI> have no name to their Fa∣milies, they are not distinguishable, but by their proper names. The Father of this present King was cal∣led
<PB N="20" REF="12"/><HI>Xun-chi,</HI> that is to say, <HI>The Son of Heaven;</HI> and this Kings name is <HI>Tun-min, A great Light.</HI></P>
<P>We desired him to tell us, how the King lives with his Wives, and what distinction he did put between their Children, and the Children of his Concubins.</P>
<P>At this question, he answered al∣most in the words of the <HI>Canticles,</HI> Chap. 6. <HI>Sexaginta sunt Reginae &amp; octogint <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Conc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>binae &amp; adolescentulo∣rum non<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est num<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rus.</HI> The truth is, the King hath fifteen Wives honor∣ed with the title of Queen, they are not all equal, three of them are more esteemed then the rest? The first, and the cheif is named <HI>Cnis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> that is to say, <HI>A perfect Queen.</HI> One of the others is stiled <HI>Tum-si, Queen of the East,</HI> and the other <HI>Si-fi, Queen of the West.</HI> These two Queens are named collateral, they attend upon the Soveraign Queen, but never speak to her but upon their
<PB N="21" REF="12"/>knees; but the other twelve are never admitted to speak to her: But if they desire to signifie any thing to her, they do it by the me∣diation of these Collateral Queens. The other Wives are more or less, according to the Kings pleasure and humor; but it is certain, that there is never less then one hundred, they are all in the Guardianship of Eu∣nuchs: But the Children of these Wives are all equal; he is looked upon to be the cheif, whom the King chuseth as his Successor. The King that reigns now, is the Son of a Concubine, he attained not to that honor for want of other Bre∣thren, for he was preferred to five of his Brethren, Queens Sons, a little before his Father died; be∣cause, when the dying King had called them before him, he did not look upon them as able to com∣mand in cheif, and manage so great an Empire. Therefore he ordered
<PB N="22" REF="13"/>this Man to be seated in the Throne, and to be proclaimed King in his stead, and his Mother to be decla∣red Queen Regent, during his mino∣rity, appointing him four Tutors or Governors, of whom the cheif is named <HI>Samni.</HI></P>
<P>I inquired afterwards, how they did bury their Kings?</P>
<P>He answered, that they did ne∣ver bury their Corps, but burn them according to the <HI>Tartarian</HI> fashion. The pile is not of Wood, but of Paper, it is almost incredi∣ble, what a vast quantity is imploy∣ed, or rather wasted, in such an oc∣casion: For they do not only burn his Body, but also all his Wardrobe, his Moveables, his Treasury, his Jewels; in a word, all that was use∣ful to the deceased, or that was de∣signed for his service, the living Animals only excepted. Twelve Elephants bridled, and richly har∣nassed, loaden with <HI>Turkish</HI> Stones,
<PB N="23" REF="13"/>meral ds, Saphirs, and all manner of jewels of an inestimable price; three hundred Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses, and one hun∣dred Camels carried the Kings Trea∣sure at the last Funeral. All this was unloaden, and put upon this Mount of Paper, erected to burn the Kings dead Body; when the fire had been put to it, the Gold and Silver did run from it in streams, and force a way through the gazing multitude, who are not all idle lookers on; for some seek to advantage them∣selves with the spoils of the de∣ceased: But there is a great care taken to prevent such kind of vio∣lences and stealth, by the watchful∣ness of the Guards, and by the grie∣vous punishments inflicted upon such offenders. The <HI>Tartars</HI> are very superstitious in this respect, and careful to consume to ashes the very Bones, and not suffer so much as the bigness of a Pins-head to re∣main; the Gold and the Silver that
<PB N="24" REF="14"/>is left, after the burning, is spent, to provide more Paper in such a case, and to burn again the relicks of the dead Body, for the Souls sake. At the last Funeral, when the expence of Paper was reckoned up, it a∣mounted to no less then Seventy thousand Crowns, and the whole Treasure that was there consumed, to Forty thousand Millions. Three of the Kings domesticks, a Privy Counsellor, a Chaplain, and a Con∣cubine, devoted themselves to at∣tend upon the deceased Princes Soul, and follow him into another life, by sacrificing themselves, assoon as the breath was out of his Body. They have always the liberty to chuse what manner of death they like best, but commonly their Heads are cut off, which is the most usual kind of death amongst these people to punish offenders, only Soldiers are strangled. Besides these three Officers, many offer themselves free∣ly
<PB N="25" REF="14"/>to death, some out of affection for their King, others out of a su∣perstitious perswasion, unto which their Religion inclines them. But in case every one should refuse to die, and none would be willing to wait upon the Princes Soul, they force such as he took most delight in, and his dearest servants to depart and follow after him.</P>
<P>I inquired next, in what did the Kings Revenue cheifly consist?</P>
<P>He informed us, that the Fields and Countrey did properly belong to the Peasants, who out of the in∣crease of their Fruits, pay about the tenth part to the King, and an∣other part to the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> that is to say, to the Gentlemen that dwell in the Castles; for they are the Lords of their adjacent Fields. This Revenue that belongs to the Crown, is very great; there is an∣other that proceeds from all the Cattle of the Kingdom, out of
<PB N="26" REF="15"/>which, a tribute is gathered: Be∣sides, there are great Customs upon Cattons and Rice transported, and several Mines in the Province of <HI>Tunan,</HI> which signifies a <HI>Southerly Cloud.</HI> These Mines yield plenty of Gold, Saphirs, Emeralds, and all manner of precious Stones, that in∣rich the Neighboring Kingdom of <HI>Pegu.</HI> There is also an unknown quantity of Silver brought out of these Cities, <HI>Quangh-ceu, Canton,</HI> and <HI>Nanquin,</HI> which are the cheif Mart Towns of all the Kingdom.</P>
<P>We asked him, if the King did often shew himself publickly in the City? And how many Inhabitants may be in <HI>Pekin?</HI></P>
<P>He told us, that he was wont to cause the Soldiers of his Guard to be drawn up in Battalia, and exer∣cise once every moneth, where he did commonly appear, to cause them to shoot at a mark in the Mea∣dows belonging to the City, be∣tween
<PB N="27" REF="15"/>the Walls that incompass it; for it is surrounded three times about, the uttermost Wall is the lowest, the two others are higher; the nearer they are to the middle of the Town. The Ditches are deep and full of Water; about the City there are many pleasant Mea∣dows. In one of them a great Sta∣tue of Wood is erected, against which, the King appoints his Soldi∣ers to shoot either with Bow and Arrows, or with Powder and Shot; one is to hit the Hand, another the Head, a third the Brest. If the Soldier misseth the first time, he hath liberty to try the second, and the third; if he fails all three, with∣out touching his mark, he receives a great many bastinadoes for his reward, and is disbanded as un∣worthy of his Kings service. In the whole City of <HI>Pekin,</HI> there cannot be less then a Million of Inhabitants, some say that there have been here∣tofore
<PB N="28" REF="16"/>Nine millions: But that is not credible, for the City is not so extraordinary large, and their Buildings are but of one story high.</P>
<P>We desired to know, how they did cover their dwellings?</P>
<P>He informed us, that they did cover them with Tiles, the Coun∣trey Houses have no other covering The Tiles of the Kings Pallace are of various colours, of yellow and marble, very pleasant and beautiful when they are looked upon at a distance: When the Sun shines up∣on them, they appear as if they were all of Gold.</P>
<P>We inquired, what Religion the <HI>Chineses</HI> did profess?</P>
<P>He answered, that they did pro∣fess Idolatry, that they were all I∣dolaters in their hearts, worship∣ing several Idols in private. But i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we consider only their outward profession, there are three differing
<PB N="29" REF="16"/>Sects. The first is of the Learned, that profess to worship a superior Being, named in their Language <HI>Sciax-ti.</HI> These two words are en∣graven upon Tables of Gold, hung up in their Temples; unto them they offer Sacrifice, by burning be∣fore them Paper gilded with Gold or Silver; together with some small round Balls made with Storax and Frankincense. But although they make profession of this Religion, which appears more plausible then the rest; it is only outwardly, that they might be distinguished from the <HI>Bonzi,</HI> a sort of men come out of <HI>China</HI> into <HI>India,</HI> extreamly super∣stitious, exceeding all others in Idolatry, and fond Conceits; at first they were in some good repute amongst the <HI>Chineses;</HI> as it common∣ly happens when any new Sect ap∣pears that is not known. The Do∣ctrine which they published of the Transmigration of Souls, which is
<PB N="30" REF="17"/>not altogether like that of <HI>Pytha∣goras,</HI> got them the peoples esteem, and procured them the envy of the Learned: So that they, in time, opposed the progress of this new Sect, more out of displeasure against it, then out of love for their antient Religion. Therefore they have so well published and established the worship of their <HI>Sciax-ti,</HI> that the Religion of the <HI>Bonzi</HI> is out of fashi∣on and date, and hath lost all its credit; and they themselves are looked upon no better then cheats. Now all over <HI>China,</HI> there is no kind of people more exclaimed against and decided; nor is there any Pro∣fession more ridiculous then that. A man of credit scorns to exchange a word with them in publick, or to be in their company, unless it be in such occasions as are not to be a∣voided; as in Funerals, publick Sa∣crifices, Processions, where these Idolatrous Priests are mercenary,
<PB N="31" REF="17"/>and hired to attend. The Nobility cause them to go in Procession in nuptial Solemnities, at the birth of their Children, and such like times. Their Processions are preceded by several Instruments of Musick, and attended with Banners, and dis∣played Ensigns, which they carry about their Idols; whose praises they sing in Songs and Hymns, and to whom they burn Paper and Fran∣kincense.</P>
<P>The second Sect is the most nume∣rous, for it consists of the Citizens, of the Nobility, of the People and Peasants; in a word, of all manner of People. These pay their Devo∣tions to the Souls of their Ancestors, unto whom they Sacrifice continu∣ally in their Temples; and in their private Houses, by burning Paper and Frankincense. All over the Countrey, this is the ordinary Sa∣crifice which is offered to the good and evil spirits every morning, be∣fore
<PB N="32" REF="18"/>they go out of their doors. The third Sect is that of the <HI>Bonzi,</HI> who are most abominably superstiti∣ous.</P>
<P>We inquired, what the <HI>Chineses</HI> did believe of Mans estate after Death?</P>
<P>They believe, answered he, that we shall be all happy, that we shall be inriched with more wisdom, and delighted with more pleasure then in this life; but they proceed no further to particularise how these advantages shall happen to Men. The Soul they believe to be immor∣tal: But replied Monsieur <HI>Dati,</HI> if they believe that all shall be hap∣py in another World, how comes it to pass, that they are not thereby en∣couraged to indulge themselves in all manner of Vices? Nothing hin∣ders, answered the Father, but the fear of present punishment. Yet they have some light perswasions of Hell, where the Souls of the wicked
<PB N="33" REF="18"/>shall be tormented; but they have found a way to get them out of those Tortures. You must know, that at <HI>Pekin,</HI> and in every considerable Town, there is a great Temple e∣rected, unto which, above three hundred little Chappels belong; every Trade hath one appertaining to it, and not only the Trades, but also every order and rank of Men, from the Magistrate to the Beggar. Now their perswasion is, that the Spirit that is to vex the Soul of the wicked man, deceased, haunts the Chappel appropriated to that Pro∣fession, unto which he did belong: For example, a Theif or a Robber shall bring a small gift to the Theifs Chappel, to ingratiate himself with, and appease the displeasure of that Spirit that punishes Theft and Rob∣bery, that he might spare him when his Soul shall fall into his hands. The Spirit makes no use of the gift, as you may imagine, but the <HI>Bonzi</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="19"/>that keep the Chappel: So is it with the rest. This is a politick In∣vention, very well contrived for two good purposes, by that means they free themselves from the trou∣blesome apprehensions of the fu∣ture; and they cause a pack of Knaves to subsist, who otherwise would trouble all the World with their begging.</P>
<P>We asked the Father, whether amongst the <HI>Chineses</HI> there were any Religious Orders of Men?</P>
<P>To this question he answered: There are no other Orders of Reli∣gious Votaries, besides the <HI>Bonzi,</HI> who are most wicked Varlets, and infamous for their unnatural love of Boys; they want not opportuni∣ties to commit this abomination, for they are intrusted with the tuition of the youth; they are as the Schoolmasters of that Countrey. This sin is too common amongst the <HI>Tartars,</HI> as well as amongst the <HI>Chi∣neses.</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="19"/>Instead of abhorring it, they make publick Profession of it, by erecting Academies for that infa∣mous purpose. This Vice hath spred it self farther into <HI>Persia;</HI> they are so base as to receive Boys in Mar∣riage, and their Fathers themselves, are not ashamed to give their con∣sent, and appoint them a kind of Portion, as to their Daughters. A∣mongst the <HI>Tartars,</HI> there are also Religious Votaries not much unlike the <HI>Bonzi;</HI> they have the care of the Sacrifices, and are attired with Yellow or Red Garments, that fall down as low as their heels, with large sleeves open. Some of them carry on their heads Paper Miters; but commonly their heads are un∣covered; they march with naked feet, and all their habit is much like that which our Painters give to the holy Apostles. This Religi∣ous Order hath many Convents of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Women, situated, for
<PB N="36" REF="20"/>the most part, upon High Moun∣tains, of an uneasie access. Out of these Monasteries, they never go out, without the leave of their Superi∣ors, and seldom, unless it be to beg, and then the oldest of them are ap∣pointed. All these Nuns make Vows of perpetual Chastity, Poverty, and Obedience; their heads are unco∣vered, and their hair is cut round, close to their ears; their garments are like to that of the <HI>Bonzi</HI> in shape; but they are of a red colour, that of the <HI>Bonzi</HI> is gray.</P>
<P>We inquired of the Sciences pro∣fessed amongst the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P>They have, said the Father, the Works of <HI>Consucius,</HI> who is as much esteemed amongst them, as <HI>Aristotle</HI> is amongst us. <HI>Confucius</HI> lived about Three thousand years ago, he hath left them a <HI>Moral Philosophy</HI> mingled with <HI>Divinity</HI> and <HI>Natural Philoso∣phy.</HI> I have seen one of his Posterity reckoned to be the Threescore and
<PB N="37" REF="20"/>third Man of his Race: He is very rich, and honored with the title of a Prince; for the Kings of <HI>China</HI> have always had so great a respect for this Learned Man, that they have allowed that title of honor to his Grand-children. Besides the Works of <HI>Confucius,</HI> they are natu∣rally inclined to the knowledges of Numbers; but their <HI>Geometry</HI> is very imperfect, for it teaches only the more ordinary and practical part: They are not in the least acquainted with the Theory, nor with the most excellent part of <HI>Geometry,</HI> as the <HI>Optick.</HI> From hence we may judge how little they excel in <HI>Painting</HI> and <HI>Architecture.</HI> They are mighti∣ly addicted to <HI>Chyromancy, Metos∣copia, Magick,</HI> and such like Arts. And in Judiciary <HI>Astrology</HI> they esteem themselves super-excellent.</P>
<P>We intreated him to tell us next, something of their Language, and of their Writings.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="21"/>
<P>For their Language, said the Fa∣ther, it is very poor, for it hath not above Four hundred words. All the Nouns are undeclinable, and the Verbs are imployed only in the In∣finitive Mood. I answered him, Sir if you would but continue but eight days in this City, I am per∣swaded that I could learn so well the Language, that I might be taken for a Natural <HI>Chinese.</HI> The Father laught at my confident conceit, and returned me this reply. After such a study of eight days, you might possibly call a Man a Hog, instead of honoring him with the title of <HI>Sir;</HI> for all the significations of the <HI>China</HI> Language consist in the varia∣tion of the accent, in the difference of the tone, in the aspirations, and other alterations of the Voice, which are almost innumerable.</P>
<P>For example, <HI>Cin</HI> pronounced sim∣ply, hath no signification. <HI>Ciunun</HI> pronounced by lengthning the pro∣nounciation
<PB N="39" REF="21"/>of the <HI>u,</HI> and sharp∣ning of the Voice, signifies <HI>Sir</HI> or <HI>Monsieur; Ciu</HI> pronounced in lengthning the <HI>u,</HI> and keeping the same tone, is a <HI>Hog; Ciu</HI> spoken swiftly, or rather shot in haste out of the Mouth, signifies a <HI>Kitchin;</HI> and <HI>Ciu</HI> made use of in the begin∣ning of a strong Voice, which di∣minisheth at last, signifies the <HI>Foot of a Stool.</HI> By this example you may see how one word may have five differing significations. In like man∣ner <HI>Tien,</HI> pronounced plainly, hath no meaning. If it be spoken sharp∣ly, so that it makes <HI>Ti-en,</HI> it will signifie <HI>Sweet.</HI> If the <HI>(i)</HI> is accent∣ed thus <HI>Ti-en,</HI> it means <HI>Bread. Ti-en</HI> uttered speedily, signifies the <HI>Foot of a Table,</HI> or of a <HI>Bed.</HI> Most part of the words in this Language are Monosillables, and may be joyned together in a various manner. But this Art of Joyning the words, is very difficult, and not to be learn∣ed
<PB N="40" REF="22"/>in an instant; but that which renders it more uneasie to strangers, is, That they have neither Cha∣racters for their Letters, nor Alpha∣bet; for they write all their Con∣ceptions in Figures and Ciphers, that signifie every one of them two or three words, and many times whole Periods and Sentences; therefore they are forced to write the five significations of the word <HI>Ciu,</HI> by five differing Ciphers, for want of Characters and Accents; whereas we might easily distinguish them by the several Accents, which we might place variously upon the same words. This is the Perfection of other Tongues, although the same word may have divers signifi∣cations, we can easily distinguish that which is proper to it in that place of the discourse, where we find it by the words that go before, and follow immediately after.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="22"/>
<P>But to return to this wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Ciu,</HI> besides the different Characters to express the five former significations. Suppose I intend to write <HI>Good mor∣row Sir,</HI> I must not make use of the Character that signifies <HI>good,</HI> nor that of <HI>Sir,</HI> but I must write an∣other Character different from all the former, which alone shall signi∣fie all these three words <HI>Good mor∣row Sir.</HI> Or suppose that I am to write <HI>Yes Sir,</HI> I must not use the Character of <HI>yes,</HI> nor that of <HI>Sir,</HI> but must imploy another which will signifie alone <HI>Yes Sir.</HI> By this you may easily judge what number of Characters are needful to write our Conceptions in this Language. Therefore it is more uneasie to read it, then it is to write it; for when we intend to express our mind in writing, it is only requisit that we should understand the single Cha∣racters of words; for when they are joyned together, we may easily
<PB N="42" REF="23"/>understand their meaning. But this manner of writing is not esteemed, and only in use amongst the vulgar sort of Men. But the Learned must be acquainted, not only with those single Characters and Ciphers, but many others of a larger significati∣on: Some reckon them to be about Seventy four thousand; whosoever knows any more then the rest, is esteemed the most Learned, because he is most able to understand and read more Books.</P>
<P>From hence it is, that this Tongue is so difficult to be learned; for as they have no Letters, they have no Dictionary to teach the meaning of the words; so that there is no other way to learn them, but to hear them spoken, to ob∣serve the sound and accent, and to imitate the Inhabitants by repeating them often, as the Parrots when they learn to speak. The Jesuites have caused a Catechism to be
<PB N="43" REF="23"/>Printed, and certain Dialogues; the one to teach the proper terms, that they might discourse of the myste∣ries of our Faith, and make the <HI>Chineses</HI> understand them; the other is for the words most common∣ly used in a familiar conversation: Nine thousand Characters which are in that Book, are sufficient for this purpose.</P>
<P>This account of the <HI>China</HI> Lan∣guage discouraged me, and took me off from my inconsiderate de∣sign of learning it in six days. When I feriously think upon it, I cannot conceive how mans life can be long enough, for any to attain to a per∣fect knowledge of so many Ciphers, to understand them, when they are placed together, and to remember their different shapes and significa∣tions. I have sought out a familiar example, to make me conceive the possibility of mastering the difficul∣ties of such a study. I remember
<PB N="44" REF="24"/>the Figures that are imployed in the Demonstrations of <HI>Geometry,</HI> may serve very well for this purpose; for although these Figures be in∣tangled in Lines, Triangles, Squares, Circles, and many such Figures which are made by the crossing and meeting of the several Lines; ne∣vertheless, at the first view, I under∣stand not only that which is demon∣strated, at last, by these differing Lines; but also many other Truths, which must of necessity appear, be∣fore all the Lines can be drawn by a great many former Figures that enter into my mind, though they appear no more in that Figure and Demonstration which they finally compleat: For all those Figures and Truths are supposed to have been sufficiently demonstrated. There is yet another difficulty in this example; the Figures of <HI>Geo∣metrical Demonstrations,</HI> are to be looked upon variously, as a strait
<PB N="45" REF="24"/>Line is sometimes the <HI>basis</HI> of the Triangle, sometimes the Diameter of a Circle, or part of an Oval, or as the right side of a Parabole, or as the <HI>Latus transversum</HI> of another. This consideration caused me to ad∣mire, the more, Mans ingenuity, and to conceive a possibility of writing and understanding the Characters of the <HI>Chineses;</HI> for our skilful <HI>Geo∣meters</HI> who are well acquainted with all the Figures of <HI>Euclides</HI> and <HI>Archimedes, &amp;c.</HI> And that are able, of that Truth that is thereby proved, and to gather from thence a great many other conse∣quences that are deduceable, seem to perform something more difficult then the <HI>Chineses,</HI> who are only to discover the meaning of certain Fi∣gures imprinted in their minds, by a long continuance and usage; for it is possible in the whole course of our
<PB N="46" REF="25"/>life to attain to a familiarity with them all.</P>
<P>The Father <HI>Grueber</HI> told us of their Marriages, that the <HI>Chineses</HI> when they came to nineteen years of age, or thereabouts, commonly espouse a Woman that is reckoned as their only and lawful Wife; they receive with her a Portion in Marri∣age, according to their Estates; but it is always in their power, to put her away by returning her Portion to her again. When a Father de∣livers his Daughter in Matrimony, he never expects to see her again, he shuts her up in a close kind of Sedan. When he hath locked her in, he delivers the Key to the good Woman, by whose Mediation the Marriage is consummated; for there are some who make it their Professi∣on and Trade, to deal in such kind of Wares. The Woman she delivers the Key to none but to the married Man, who is not to open it, and
<PB N="47" REF="25"/>free his Bride from her prison, but when she is brought into the Nupti∣al Chamber. When the Virgins of the Nobility go abroad, they are carried in Litters by Horses or Asses covered over with a Vail, the rest march on foot with their faces also hid; all kind of Women appear in this manner in publick. He told us afterwards, that when any Man hath taken a Wife, he is at his liberty to entertain as many Con∣cubines as he pleaseth, of whom there are two sorts, some free, others slaves: The free are descended of Gentlemen, or other Persons well qualified, who to free themselves from the burden of so many Chil∣dren, which they have by their many Concubines, are ready to part with their Daughters upon that ac∣count for small sums of Money, which they never restore again to the Men, when they divorce or send them away. All the Children re∣main
<PB N="48" REF="26"/>still with the Father, unless he please to allow a yearly Pension to them and their Mothers. The Con∣cubines that are slaves, are common∣ly the Daughters of the meaner sort of people, they part with them for the same reason as the Gentlemen do with theirs: They bring their Children to the Market-place of the City to sell them; Daughters to serve as Concubines, and the Boys as Servants; but they commonly drowned all such Children, Males and Females as are crooked or mi∣shapen at their Birth, or when they are otherwise deformed. For fifteen crowns any man may chuse the most beautiful Girls of the meaner sort to be his Concubine; but their con∣dition is most miserable, for they are forced to carry water, and to drudge about the lowest offices of the family: When their Master de∣sires to enjoy them, they cannot re∣fuse him; for they were bought for
<PB N="49" REF="26"/>that purpose; and although they may be of as good Family as himself; if they are taken in Adultery, they commonly loose their heads. The Catholick Priests make use of these meaner Concubines, to insinuate the Mysteries of <HI>Christianity,</HI> into the minds of the other Women, and to teach the Children of the Noblest Families. They have been by this means so successful, that many of these Women are become Converts, but they do not think it convenient to baptize them, in regard of that obligation that lies upon them, to grant to their Masters all the liberty that they desire.</P>
<P>The Catholick Religion is there freely professed all over the Empire, without let or hinderance. In every one of their Churches, a Copy of the Kings Mandate, by which he grants a free exercise of our Religi∣on, is graven in a Stone, and hung up in an eminent place, in the view
<PB N="50" REF="27"/>of the Congregation. <HI>Christians</HI> are very well esteemed of in all the Provinces of <HI>China;</HI> and the <HI>Tartars</HI> as well as the <HI>Chineses,</HI> have liberty to turn <HI>Christians,</HI> and imbrace the Catholick Faith. The Learned Men of the Countrey, are familiarly ac∣quainted with our <HI>Missionary Priests;</HI> the greatest opposition that they meet with, is from the Idolatrous <HI>Bonzi.</HI> The Father told us, that he had left in <HI>China</HI> six and twenty Je∣suites, four at <HI>Pekin,</HI> six <HI>Jacobins,</HI> and two bare-footed <HI>Carmelites.</HI> These <HI>Missionaries</HI> wear the same habit as the Learned of the Coun∣trey, a long garment of white Da∣mask that reaches to the ground. Father <HI>Adam Schall</HI> is one of the four <HI>Missionary Jesuites</HI> in this City, he hath lived forty five years in <HI>China,</HI> and is very well esteemed of the Prince and People.</P>
<P>We inquired what kind of Coyn
<PB N="51" REF="27"/>or Money, and what Weights the <HI>Chineses</HI> use?</P>
<P>He answered, That they had but one sort of Coyn Printed, named <HI>Cuxa,</HI> of very base mettle, each of them is worth about a farthing; upon one side is the Kings name, up∣on the other, the name of the Coyn. Three hundred peeces of this money make a <HI>Lexu,</HI> which is worth about a Crown; they divide the <HI>Lexu</HI> in ten <HI>Ziens,</HI> in eight <HI>Fueus,</HI> and every <HI>Fueu</HI> in ...... <HI>Cuxas.</HI> They use in∣stead of Money, both Gold and Silver pieces, which they cut off as they spend; for that purpose, they carry in their Boots, and about them, Seales and Cizers.</P>
<P>The Pound weight of <HI>China</HI> is sixteen of our ounces. They mea∣sure by a cubit: All kind of Victu∣als is very cheap, as well as their cloathing; for five <HI>Fucas,</HI> which are five of our pence, one may buy a very large Hen; by that any may
<PB N="52" REF="28"/>judge of every thing else that is sold, at a proportionable rate.</P>
<P>We asked him concerning their Meat and Drink.</P>
<P>He told us, that they had no Wine, although their Countrey af∣fords excellent Grapes. The <HI>Euro∣peans</HI> sometimes make Wine with them, which the Inhabitants like very well, but they dare not drink of it, but in private, for this proud Nation have a Law in force to punish severely all such as shall bring in new modes of living. Their or∣dinary drink is <HI>Thé,</HI> and Wine made of Rice; they extract it doubtless by the Limbick and the Still. It is not certainly known how they do it, for they will not discover the secret of any of their Arts to strang∣ers, unless they swear first to profess it, and it may cost them their lives, if they fail afterwards. They de∣light to drink hot liquors for that purpose; they are always upon the
<PB N="53" REF="28"/>fire in vessels near their Tables. In Summer they cast a little quantity of Ice in their drink, which they suffer to remain there only for a mo∣ment, that the liquor may receive from it, in so short a time, some∣thing of its cold nature to cool the stomach; but they quickly take it out again, that they might not loose the pleasure of drinking it hot. They keep their Ice, as we do in <HI>Europe;</HI> it is sold about the Towns very cheap, they use it more to cool their Fruits, then their Drinks, for they delight to eat them very cold.</P>
<P>But to return to their liquors, Wine made of Rice, appears of a whiteness, inclining a little to the Amber colour, and mixed with a Golden Yellow, very beautiful to the eye. It hath a very pleasant taste, and so delicious, that it seems as good as the best Sack. The com∣mon people drink out of Earthen
<PB N="54" REF="29"/>Vessels, but the rich and noble are provided with Golden and Silver, adorned with ordinary Workman∣ship. The greatest Lords use drink∣ing Vessels made with the Horns of a <HI>Rhinocerot,</HI> imbellished in a course manner, inriched with Gold, and sometimes with Diamonds. For their Meats they have all kind of varieties, as we have in <HI>Europe,</HI> of Venison, and of Fowl, of all man∣ner of Fruits and Pulse. Their Spi∣ces are better then ours, for they are nearer to the <HI>Molucas.</HI> Their Wheat is very good, they can make Meal of it, but they have no skill to knead it into Bread; therefore in lieu of that, they use Rice which hath soaked in the Water, and been parched and dried afterwards at the fire. This they take and carry to their Mouths, with long sticks that serve them instead of Forks. In their left hands they are commonly provided with a Porringer full of
<PB N="55" REF="29"/>this Rice, which they use instead of Bread, taking it out with their sticks at every bit of Meat. They have no skill, nor taste to season their Meats well: In the same Pot they boil Pork, Hare, Fish, Veal, and Pheasant together; and their best Cooks are continually pouring in abundance of Water, while they are boiling. When they are sodden, they fill their Porringers and Dishes with this mad <HI>Oleo Podrido,</HI> which serves them instead of Pottage. The most ordinary Flesh that they feed upon is Pork; their Mutton is in good esteem amongst them. The poorer sort eat Asses, Dogs, Cats, and such like things, which they buy in Shambles, appointed for all kind of Flesh. The dried Legs of Dogs, well and curiously smoaked as we do our Neats Tongues, is a bit very savory to them; they commonly reserve it for their dessert and last morsel at dinner; they
<PB N="56" REF="30"/>esteem it a great fortifier of the stomach. They bring every kind of Meat severally in distinct Dishes, but they have but two sorts of Saw∣ces to encourage and provoke appe∣tite. The first is a kind of Paste made with small Beans in this man∣ner; they beat the Beans soaked in Water, and then stir them well to∣gether in the Water; when upon the top there appears a thin cover∣ing, or green skin, they strain all through a Linnen cloath into clean Water; the finest substance runs through, but the skins remain be∣hind. This they use instead of Sawce to all their Meats, and instead of Salt also; for they never salt them otherwise, although they want not Wells and Fountains of Salt and Brackish Water in all the West∣ern Provinces. The other Sawce is named <HI>Mi-sso,</HI> which is made of a rotten Grain that yields a most noy∣some smell; they do not boil it
<PB N="57" REF="30"/>with the rest of their Meats, but they put it by it self in Sawcers; and when they are at dinner, they dip their morsels of Meat in this strong and filthy Mustard. At their Feasts, and at the Tables of their Nobles and Lords, they garnish their Dishes variously, but ordina∣rily with Rice, Herbs, or with hard Eggs, minced small and fried. When their Cooks have shewn all their art and skill in such occasions, it is no light punishment to condemn a Man of <HI>Europe,</HI> to carry thither an empty stomach: Therefore when strangers are invited, they provide themselves with a good dinner be∣fore hand, for they are certain to meet with nothing there fit for their appetites.</P>
<P>Their Tables stand round about the room where the Feast is to be held, never above two or three are together at the same Table, the Ma∣ster is wont to sit alone at the lower
<PB N="58" REF="31"/>most. They use no Table-cloaths, but cover them with as many neces∣sary utensils, as there should be per∣sons at the Table: These utensils are a dish to drinkin, a Plate of Rice, another of their dainty <HI>Mi-sso,</HI> and two of these Sticks, that serve them instead of Forks. All their Dishes are of Porcelane, the Kings as well as the meanest Subjects, with this difference, That the one is of a finer substance then the other. When the invited guests are seated, an Officer ushers in the first service; and when all the Tables are furnished, he makes a sign to all to begin to eat. If any should offer to touch the Meat before he hath given the sig∣nal, he would be severely checked, and looked upon as a Clown or an impatient Glutton. The signal or liberty of eating, is given by saying to them all <HI>Zin,</HI> that is to say, <HI>I in∣vite you;</HI> then the guests all answer, <HI>Zin, zin, zin,</HI> repeating this word
<PB N="59" REF="31"/>three times, as the <HI>Italian</HI> Priests do the word <HI>Peace,</HI> when they salute and embrace one another. After this, they all carry their hands to their several Dishes together, and the Meat to their Mouths; and if any do not eat at the same time, as the rest, the Officer calls upon them; for they think that the perfection of their Feasts consists in eating altoge∣ther, otherwise they judge it to be out of order, and unhandsome. When the Officer esteems that they have sufficiently eaten of the first service, he causeth the second to be brought in, and after that the third, observing the same ceremonies and decency, as at the first. Likewise, when he thinks it is time to drink, he invites them to it, in the same manner as he doth to eat; but they must all empty their Cups. When they begin to drink the first time, the Stage-players enter into the Room, some of them are common,
<PB N="60" REF="32"/>who play for Mony at every House, when they are hired, others are en∣tertained by Noblemen; the richest have several companies of them, as the great Lords in <HI>Europe</HI> have Musicians. These kind of people are very richly cloathed; when they come in, they address themselves to him that sits at the highest Seat to shew him their Book of Comedies, and to desire him to tell them upon what subject to play. He sends them, out of civility, down to another, with their Book, which comes at last to the Master of the House, who commonly tells them to act what Comedy they please. This Comedy lasts about a quarter of an hour: The Subjects of the most part of their Comedies, are taken from the Lives and Heroick Actions of their former Kings and Queens; when the Comedy is ended, the Officer enters in with other Dishes of Meat; and when they are all taken away,
<PB N="61" REF="32"/>and have ended their drinking, the Comedians return again, observing the same ceremony as before, to in∣treat the assistants one after another, to appoint the subject, upon which they are to discourse and act. When this second Comedy is finished, the Officer comes again to give his at∣tendance: Now this unpleasant di∣version lasts sometimes six or seven hours. I had almost forgot, said the Father, to tell you, that they have no <HI>Olives</HI> growing in <HI>China,</HI> therefore they make use of three other sorts of Oyl: The richest have an Oyl taken out of the Berries of Flowers of that Countrey, that grow upon Bryars: This is very sweet and pleasant. I know not how they make it, but they have a great quantity of it; for their Land is as fruitful of such Bryars, as ours is of Nettles. The meaner sort of people make use of another Oyl, extract∣ed from a Grain which they call <HI>Tel∣selin;</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="33"/>it hath almost the same taste as the Oyl of <HI>Sesamum,</HI> a little bit∣ter. The Countrey People, as in <HI>Poland,</HI> employ the Oyl of <HI>Line</HI> or <HI>Flax,</HI> or another kind of Oyl ex∣tracted from a Plant named <HI>Ma-sen,</HI> which hath a most odious and strong smell. They never eat any Sallads, nor other raw Herbs; many of their Fruits they preserve in Salt and Vinegar. In short they are not cu∣rious in their taste and eating, but are filthy and unhandsome. When we had a Pheasant, or a Hair, we could not abide to see our <HI>China</HI> Cook handle and dress it; we were forced to spit and dress it our selves, and eat it in the most retired Room, having first forbidden the door to be opened to any that should come, unless it be to the Kings Officers. And that none might surprise us un∣awares, while our Meat was pre∣paring, always one of us stood Senti∣nel at the Window, to give warn∣ing
<PB N="63" REF="33"/>of any Mans coming up to us.</P>
<P>It is a very strange thing said Monsieur <HI>Dati,</HI> that this Nation that hath so many Sheep and Cows, have no skill to make Cheese with their Milk, in any other manner, but with small Beans.</P>
<P>This proceeds, replied the Fa∣ther, from their unsufferable Pride; for they scorn to learn any thing, from strangers, especially from the <HI>Tartars;</HI> because the <HI>Tartars</HI> make Cheese that is enough to cause them to abominate such a composi∣tion; for that Nation. I could never make use of any of their Cheese, nor of the Milk of the <HI>Chineses;</HI> for both yield a most odious smell. The <HI>Tartars</HI> make their Cheese of the shape of our Cracknels, and hang them up with strings, a great many together, at their Shops, to invite the hungry stomach to buy them; they are so grievous hard, that the
<PB N="64" REF="34"/>Flint Stones are not more. They are not to be eaten, but after they have been softned by the Fire, and molified as our Wax.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Chineses,</HI> are far more nice and curious in their sleeping, then in their eating and drinking. In Winter they spred Cotten Mats upon little Furnaces, and square Stoves, named <HI>Caù,</HI> where they keep a very moderate Fire. Upon these Mats they lay very fine Sheets of Cotton, all their Linnen is of that substance; for they use their <HI>Line</HI> to make Oyl, and their <HI>Flax</HI> to twist into Ropes. At the four corners of their <HI>Caù,</HI> there are Pillars as at our Beds; at the top round, the Curtains are fastned, which they call <HI>Cai-ïà.</HI> In Winter they are of Cloth, or of some other thick sub∣stance; but in Summer they are of a very fine and thin Cotton, to keep off the Musketas. When the cold is over, they carry their Mats, and
<PB N="65" REF="34"/>lay them upon Boards or Tables; and in the heat of Summer, instead of Wool and Cotton, they fill them with a Sea weed, which when it is dried, is as soft as Silk, and as light as Feathers: It is naturally very cool. Their Bolsters and Pillows are very neatly made of the thinnest and softest skins of Reed, which we call <HI>Indian Cane,</HI> in the manner of Hurdles. When the inside is emp∣tied out, and shut up close, they are filled with wind, which yields in the hottest Season much pleasure. The head feels them to be very soft, and never sinks deep; it is not buri∣ed as in our Down-pillows, they are very smooth. Their head are as though they were upon Springs, when they turn; and at the least motion, they cause their Pillows and Bolsters, to send up a cold and fresh Air to cool their faces, which is a notable advantage in the hottest nights of the Summer.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="35"/>
<P>Their Chairs are of the same sub∣stance, the Back and the Elbows are made of the Skins of <HI>Indian Cane,</HI> very commodious to sit down. The <HI>Tartars</HI> are not so effeminate to make use of all these things, they sleep upon the bare ground as the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>We desired him to tell us some∣thing of the Kings pomp, and of the magnificence of his Throne, when he appears in publick in all his grandeur.</P>
<P>He assured us, that the former Kings of <HI>China</HI> did delight in a great deal of glory and state; but that the present King of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who reigns now in <HI>China,</HI> is not so cere∣monious: He is content in his great∣est splendor, to sit upon a Carpet spred on the ground.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Dati</HI> desired to know from the Father, in what the <HI>Chi∣neses</HI> were most expensive.</P>
<PB N="67" REF="35"/>
<P>He answered, that they spent much in their Funerals, in the great quantity of Perfumes and Wax, which they did there burn, in the making of Wooden Statues, in their Frankincense, which they did offer to the deceased, and specially in the rare Coffins, in which they put the dead Bodies. They are of pre∣cious Wood, as of <HI>Aloes,</HI> of <HI>Yellow Saunders,</HI> or of some other <HI>Aroma∣tick Wood</HI> of a great value: This serves instead of imbalming.</P>
<P>We inquired of the goodness of the Air, of the Countrey, and how long the Inhabitants do commonly live.</P>
<P>The Air, said he, is very good every-where; therefore the Coun∣trey people that are temperate in their diet, commonly live to be very old; some are one hundred years of age. The Nobility at forty seem to be old, and when they see fifty, they begin to be crasie; this
<PB N="68" REF="36"/>difference proceeds from their de∣baucheries with the Female Sex, and their immoderate eating, in which they prescribe no bounds to themselves. Their Daughters sel∣dom come to be thirty years of age, because their Mothers are wont to tie and bind their Legs assoon as they are born; for they think all their beauty consists in crooked Legs, which is that part alone of their Bodies seen when they go a∣broad.</P>
<P>This strange and unnatural bending and tying of their Legs so young, disorders the Channels, through which; the nourishment of their Members passeth, and stops the Conduits, in such a manner, that neither their Legs nor their Bodies ever come to a perfect stature and bigness; for by that means, the Blood is hindered in its ordinary circulation; and the complexion and constitution of their Bodies be∣ing
<PB N="69" REF="36"/>vitiated, it hastens them the sooner to their Graves.</P>
<P>We desired him to tell us, which were their most noted Festivals?</P>
<P>He answered us, That they cheifly observe three; the one at the first New Moon in <HI>February,</HI> the second in <HI>November,</HI> and the third at the Kings Birth-day. In every one of these Festivals, the King goes out of the City, attended upon by all the Nobility and Lords of the Court; by the Magistrates, Officers of the Law, and by the Learned Men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Every one wears an habit suitable to his dignity and place. All their Garments are differing from one an∣other, none but the King dares wear a Pearl alone at the top of his Gap. Many of the most eminent Lords have precious Stones, and some Pearls; but always a Ruby, an Emerald, or a Jasper, is put with it; for none but the King is to wear it alone. He wears also as marks of
<PB N="70" REF="37"/>his Royalty, two Storks embroider∣ed with Silver upon his Brest. The <HI>Mandarins</HI> have other Animals: There are nine cheif differences, by which the Nobility is distinguished in their habits. The first hath a Crane for his Badge, the second a Lion, the third an Eagle, the fourth a Peacock; I do not remember the rest, nor what differences are to be noted in the Garments of their Ma∣gistrates and Learned Men. I only remember the Badge of the <HI>Mathe∣maticians,</HI> they wear four little Squares of Jasper, tied with silken strings at their Girdles. In the mid∣dle of the Squares there is a Ruby, and upon the top of their Bonnet, they bear a Ruby and a Pearl to∣gether. The most ordinary colours of their Garments, are Red, Blew, Orange mixed with Blew. We have already said, that their <HI>Bonzi</HI> are cloathed in Gray, and the Learned in White.</P>
<PB N="71" REF="37"/>
<P>I remember that at every Festi∣val observed at the New Moon in <HI>February,</HI> every one is wont to melt or cast some piece of Mettle; upon which they represent the Figure of a Crescent or New Moon; and they call this Festival, <HI>The Sacrifice of the Hare.</HI></P>
<P>We inquired, Whether the <HI>Chi∣neses</HI> had any Memorials so antient, that give an account of the passages of so many thousand years ago, as some do affirm.</P>
<P>He told us, that they had no Hi∣stories more antient then King <HI>Tao,</HI> who lived about four thousand se∣ven hundred years ago; and that they had no Histories of antienter date, that speak of the beginning and continuance of the World.</P>
<P>We put the Father next upon the Art of Navigation, to know whe∣ther they believe in <HI>China,</HI> that there is any passage out of <HI>Asia</HI> into <HI>America;</HI> he assured us, that they
<PB N="72" REF="38"/>had but little skill in Navigation; that they know not well how to make use of the <HI>Compass,</HI> or rather this knowledge is defective. Their greatest Vessels are not able to carry above fifty Men, their Sails are made of Mat, but so artificially, that they can go almost with any wind. Their rowing differs from ours, for they move their Oars be∣fore and behind. Therefore as they have no great insight into the Art of Navigation, it is not possible that they should be able to adven∣ture far at Sea, they dare not loose the sight of the Land.</P>
<P>Concerning their passing from <HI>Asia</HI> into <HI>America,</HI> the Father told us, That he knew nothing certain, because the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Holland∣ers</HI> have been disappointed in their attempting to pass through the <HI>Frozen Sea,</HI> where they have no manner of Trade: For the <HI>Tartars</HI> they are no great Traders, and it is
<PB N="73" REF="38"/>not probable, that any of them will venture upon a meer curiosity, to open that passage. It is not likely, that the <HI>Chineses</HI> will leave their Countrey, to undertake any such hazardous voyage: Nevertheless, it is generally believed, that there is some-where a passage, or that <HI>Asia</HI> is divided from <HI>America,</HI> but by a Narrow Sea. The continual ap∣pearance of many wild Fowl of <HI>A∣merica,</HI> in the Southern Parts of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> do very much strengthen this opinion: For it is not probable, that they would there be seen, if <HI>America</HI> and <HI>Tartaria</HI> were not joyn∣ed together, or not far from one an∣other.</P>
<P>We asked him concerning the Dan∣cings, Plays, and Gardens of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses,</HI> replied the Father, never dance, but the <HI>Tartars</HI> use that sport amongst themselves; the Men with the Men, and the Women with the Women; but never both Sexes
<PB N="74" REF="39"/>together. Their Musick consists in striking their hands one against an∣other, or in beating upon some V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sel of Mettal that yields a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sound. The <HI>Chineses</HI> have all ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ner of Sports and Plays; they pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with Balls and Draughts, with Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Cards; they are very dext<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣rous in striking the Ball with their feet: Their manner is not to play in parties, only five or six meet to∣gether, and send with their feet th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ball from one to the other; I hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seen a Ball continue a quarter of an hour without touching the Ground. Their Gardens are, for the most part inclosed Meadows, on purpose to e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ercise themselves with a Ball. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y have no other sweet scented flowers, but <HI>Jasmin;</HI> their Roses are very beautiful, but without any scer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ They have also some Tulips, Vio∣lets, and Gilliflowers; but they know not so much as the name of an Anemone: Nevertheless their
<PB N="75" REF="39"/>Gardens are very green and delight∣ful, because of the conveniency of watering them with fresh Rivers; but they have but small skill to dress and order them. All that I could take notice of, in such places, was in the Kings Garden, where is to be seen a great Cascade of Water, that falls from a Rock of Brass, covered all over with artificial Trees of the same substance. The <HI>Chineses</HI> are extraordinary skilful in the Art of casting Mettals; therefore their Ar∣tillery is very beautiful.</P>
<P>We desired him to inform us of something concerning their other Arts, and cheifly concerning their Physick and Physitians.</P>
<P>Their Physitians, answered the Father, are notable in discerning by the Pulse, the nature and qualities of a disease; but their knowledge is not so extraordinary in prescribing remedies, for they govern themselves by guess, at all adventures, as our Physitians.</P>
<PB N="76" REF="40"/>
<P>I can speak of both by experi∣ence; for when I fell sick, about forty days distance from the City of <HI>Pekin,</HI> one of the Kings Physitians visited me, at the request of Father <HI>Adam Schall.</HI> As soon as he was come into my Chamber, he caused me to sit down and suffered me to rest quietly a while. Afterwards he uncovered both my Arms as far as the Elbows, placing them upon a Table, and felt the Pulses of both Arms, one after another; pressing the Arteries sometimes hard, some∣times softly, sometimes equally; and at other times he prest hard upon one Arm, leaving the other free: Sometimes he prest hard upon one Pulse, and softly upon the other; he continued to feel it along while, a∣non he felt it but by turns; sometimes he caused me to hold my fist closed, anon he made me open it. In short, he felt and examined my Pulse, as it did beat in every posture of my
<PB N="77" REF="40"/>Arm and Hand, which lasted a long while, about three quarters of an hour. After all this, I had almost a mind to discover to him my dis∣case, but Father <HI>Adam</HI> interrupted me, and told me, that he knew it better then I did. When the Phy∣sitian was sate down, he described with a wonderful majesty my dis∣ease, and all its properties and cir∣cumstances, assigning to them the time of their first beginning, in such an exact manner, that I was strange∣ly surprised. He appointed me some Potions, but by the small advantage that I received from them, I found that he had been more skilful to guess at my disease, then to prescribe Remedies. They never let any man blood, as we do, but instead of that, they make use of Cupping-Glasses in the Shoulders: They cure the Pox very well, with certain mixture of Herbs; so that this dis∣ease is not so mortal, in these parts,
<PB N="78" REF="41"/>as in <HI>Turky, Persia,</HI> and other Coun∣treys of the <HI>East Indies:</HI> They have amongst their Physicks a very fa∣mous Root that grows, cheifly, in the Province of <HI>Sur-iven,</HI> they name it <HI>Tigers-Milk;</HI> for they say, That it never comes, but where the Milk of the she <HI>Tigers</HI> hath moistened the ground, when they are furious and inraged by the pursuit of Hunts∣men. It is certain, that the smell of this Root is very like the smell of Milk, and its colour is white as Milk: They say, that when this Root is well prepared according to their skill, it is able to give an in∣fallible sweat; it is true, I have seen the Root, but never the experiments of its vertues.</P>
<P>We questioned him afterwards, concerning the other Arts of the <HI>Chineses;</HI> and the Father in the same order, as we had proposed to him, returned us an answer to every question.</P>
<PB N="79" REF="41"/>
<P>That in <HI>China</HI> they have no Chry∣stal, but many Glasses, one sort espe∣cially, which they name <HI>Rice-Glass,</HI> it is more brittle then our Glasses, but easier to work: For as soon as the substance of it feels the heat of the Furnace, it melts; and they are not unskilful in handling it, for they make with it most beautiful shapes and fabricks. Instead of Iron, they make use of great and hollow staves of Glass, as our Enammellers in <HI>Europe.</HI> All their Looking-Glasses are very good; and as they have a particular Art in Melting and Cast∣ing Mettals, they make many curi∣ous Looking-Glasses in a Concavity, for a very small price; for a little above a peice, one may buy a Look∣ing-Glass containing thirty two Thumbs in Diameter. The Jesuites have carried to them the Art of making Spectacles and Telescopes. It is a wonderful thing that the <HI>Chineses</HI> have humbled themselves
<PB N="80" REF="42"/>so much, as to learn this skill from us. At present they do them very well, according to our patterns which the Merchants of <HI>Europe</HI> transport thither. Our Specta∣cles of the larger size, is a gift well accepted of them; therefore the Merchants do not forget to furnish them with this commodity.</P>
<P>They make excellent Stuffs with Thred of Gold, and with Golden Wire they make many beautiful Works: But they boast much of their Art in Gilding with Gold and Silver-Straw at the fire, in several manners; for with this gilded Straw they compose many rare and excel∣lent Works. But I judge them to be most ingenious, in their making of artificial fires with Gunpowder; for they cause them to represent all kind of Shapes, Characters, Figures of Trees, and to appear in all man∣ner of natural colours. I could never have believed from others re∣lations,
<PB N="81" REF="42"/>what my eyes have con∣vinced me to be true. I have seen at a Feast, a big Vine come down from the Roof of a large Room; and another fire after incompass it about, representing its Leaves and Grapes so perfectly well, and so na∣turally coloured, that a Painter could not have shewn one more lively.</P>
<P>This appearance lasted as long as we are repeating over our <HI>Mi∣sereri;</HI> when the combustible mat∣ter was spent, the artificial Vine vanished away, leaving behind a dark mist in every place, where any part of the Vine had appeared with its Leaves and Branches of Grapes. They have something of this Art in <HI>Persia,</HI> but they cannot do such wonderful feats as in <HI>China,</HI> for here they care not to communicate their skill: The expence is not ex∣traordinary, for forty shillings any man may have a fire representing
<PB N="82" REF="43"/>three or four shapes. At these words I instantly replied to Father <HI>Grue∣ber.</HI> You make me now believe, what I could never credit before. About eleven years ago, I met at <HI>Rome</HI> with Monsieur <HI>Sestel,</HI> a <HI>Dane,</HI> who told me, that some of his Friends had written to him from <HI>Coppenhagen,</HI> that a <HI>Dane</HI> being re∣turned out of <HI>China,</HI> had shewn the King an artificial Fire that rose up into the Air, and burst out into many flames, which represented the Kings name. The Father replied, You may safely believe it; but I wonder how this man could come to understand the mystery, which he could never have been able to put in practice, unless he had tried it before, and taken an Oath re∣quired in all such occasions, I wonder also, how he could escape out of the Countrey after such an Oath.</P>
<PB N="83" REF="43"/>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Dati</HI> asked, Whether they use any Coaches or Chariots?</P>
<P>He answered, That the <HI>Chineses</HI> are carried in Litters by Mules, or by Men; they are like ours, but somewhat longer; for they put in them, their Cloaths, a Bed, a Table, and other conveniencies for a Tra∣veller. The <HI>Tartars</HI> have Coaches, with two Wheels, drawn by one or two Mules or Horses. The Ladies of Viceroys, or of other eminent Lords, are drawn by two of these Beasts, and incompassed about with a great many <HI>Tartarian</HI> Women on Horsback, Armed with Bow and Arrows. They carry their Bag and Baggage upon Camels backs, and up∣on a kind of carriage that hath but one great Wheel that turns in the midst of two Trunks full of Stuff. One man draws this with a Girdle tied to his middle, and tied also to two Staves that are fastned to the Trunks, with which he governs
<PB N="84" REF="44"/>this Carriage at his pleasure. They carry about their Wares and Com∣modities through the Land, in this manner.</P>
<P>We asked him, Whether they de∣light in Hunting? Whether they run Races? Whether they be good Horsmen? And, whether they have any skill to manage Horses?</P>
<P>He answered, That the <HI>Tartars</HI> are good Huntsmen, but the <HI>Chine∣ses</HI> seldom practice hunting: They know not what it is to run a Race; they are very careful and curious in harnassing well their Horses, but they do not know how to man∣age them.</P>
<P>We desired to know, Whether they took any Tobacco?</P>
<P>To this he replied, That they take no Tobacco in Powder, but in Smoak; the <HI>Tartars</HI> and the <HI>Chine∣ses,</HI> the Men and the Women are great takers of Tobacco. For that purpose, the Women are commonly
<PB N="85" REF="44"/>provided with a Bag that hangs over their shoulders, where their Pipe and their Tobacco is kept; but the Men carry their Pipes at their Gir∣dles.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Dati</HI> desired to know, Whether the word <HI>Mandarin</HI> be of <HI>China?</HI></P>
<P>He answered, That it was a <HI>Por∣tugues,</HI> and that at <HI>China</HI> they are termed <HI>Quoan,</HI> which signifies a Prince, or a Governor.</P>
<P>We asked him concerning their Courage and Inclinations, to Mar∣tial exploits and War.</P>
<P>He assured us, That they were Cowards, and that in three years time that he lived in <HI>China,</HI> he ne∣ver could see above two people fight together at cuffs; for they have no other way to satisfie their revenge, and end their quarrels.</P>
<P>We inquired of him, whether in his return he had not met with one Monsieur <HI>Tavernier,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Mer∣chant,
<PB N="86" REF="45"/>that was gone from <HI>Legorne,</HI> about two years since, into the <HI>In∣dies,</HI> to carry thither a great deal of riches in Jewels; amongst the rest, he had a set of great Saphires, and of Pearls, as big as Pears, to make a Rose, which he intended for the Great <HI>Mogol,</HI> to imbellish the Plume of his Elephant. I told him also, that Monsieur <HI>Tavernier</HI> had said, That the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> did spend e∣very day Fifteen thousand Crowns, only to keep the Elephants of the late King his Father. Therefore I desired him to tell us, whether we were to believe any such thing.</P>
<P>He assured us, That he had met with Monsieur <HI>Tavernier</HI> in <HI>Persia,</HI> and that I might credit what he had told me, and much more concern∣ing the expence of this Prince to keep his Elephants.</P>
<P>That you may better understand the truth, you must know said Fa∣ther <HI>Grueber,</HI> That <HI>India</HI> beyond,
<PB N="87" REF="45"/>and on this side of the River <HI>Gan∣ges,</HI> is divided into several distinct Regions or Governments, which are given by the Great <HI>Mogol,</HI> to the Lords of his Court, during life, upon condition of paying every year a certain sum of money, as a Present or a Tribute. Besides that, they are also obliged to keep al∣ways, some a thousand, others two thousand men on foot, others five thousand, which may be ready to march at the Emperors command. By this means it happens, that the number of their <HI>Militia</HI> never di∣minishes; and when the Prince comes to take a view of them, if the Soldiers be not well chosen, and of a good appearance, well cloathed and armed, their Cheiftains are in danger of Banishment from Court. Therefore the <HI>Mogol,</HI> may upon a sudden, raise five or six hun∣dred thousand men, ready for the encounter, without putting himself
<PB N="88" REF="46"/>to any extraordinary expence; for every Governor is obliged to have all his <HI>Militia</HI> ready, in all times of the greatest Peace. Now you must understand, that six or seven Ele∣phants are kept purposely to attend upon the person of the <HI>Mogol,</HI> they are named <HI>Panciasari,</HI> which signi∣fies <HI>Lords of Five thousands;</HI> be∣cause the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> expends as much to keep them, as the Lords or Governors do, to entertain Five thousand Horse in the Army.</P>
<P>By this you may judge, that what Monsieur <HI>Tavernier</HI> has told you, is very true. But you may take notice, that the <HI>Mogol</HI> spends a great deal of this money in keep∣ing fair Horses, as well as Elephants. They are richly harnassed and ador∣ned with many precious Stones; the <HI>Mogol</HI> delights much to make them run Races.</P>
<P>He told us, that the present Em∣peror in his young days, did seem
<PB N="89" REF="46"/>to affect a retired life, spending his time in contemplation. But since this crafty Hypocrite hath cast a∣way his Mask, and pulled down his Father from his Throne, shutting him up in a prison at <HI>Agra;</HI> the old man is about Eighty six years of Age: Only the fear of the Rebelli∣on of his people, that did intirely love the Father, has hindered him from taking away his life. His pri∣son is a very large Palace, with many Buildings about it, and pleasant Gardens. He is there guarded by a numerous Company of Muskettiers, and attended upon by his Women that are kept in an adjoyning <HI>Se∣raglio,</HI> in which he spends, for the most part his time, and passeth the melancholly thoughts of his retire∣ment. The Emperor, his Son, cau∣sed a high Tower to be built near to this place, in such a manner, that it did overlook all the Gardens of his Father: Upon it he appointed a
<PB N="90" REF="47"/>Watchman to overlook and spie out all that passed in the Prison; but the old man caused him to be shot and killed by a Company of his Women: Then he desired the cheif Commander of the Prison, to tell his Son, from him, that he should do well to send such manner of Birds, and place them upon the same Tower, for they would give a great sport to his Women.</P>
<P>The present <HI>Mogol,</HI> or Emperor, is renowned for many examples of Justice and Wisdom, that are report∣ed of him. It hapned when I was at <HI>Lahor,</HI> a Prince caused the Groom of his Stables to be killed in a very barbarous manner, his head to be struck through with a large Nail, for a small fault, for not having tended and dressed his beloved Horse, as he should have done. When the Emperor was sitting in the Seat of Judicature, which he constantly doth every moneth, in a
<PB N="91" REF="47"/>day appointed for that purpose, in a great Meadow, out of the Royal City, the Grooms or Farrier Wife made her complaints of the cruel massacre of her Husband; the Great <HI>Mogol</HI> sent immediately for the Prince, and asked him, If it were so as the Woman said; He confessed his crime: Therefore the <HI>Mogol</HI> caused him to be stretched upon the Ground, and commanded the Wo∣man, or the Farriers Widow, to deal with him in the same manner as he had dealt with her deceased husband. There are many other reports con∣cerning the Justice and Wisdom of this Prince. He governs his King∣dom very well, and causeth Justice to be administred, only to ingrati∣ate himself with his Subjects, and prevent the tumults which they might otherwise be tempted to raise, because of the cruel detention of his aged Father; for which unnatural deed, he knows that he is hated.</P>
<PB N="92" REF="48"/>
<P>He is about forty years old, it may be when his Father shall be dead, he will loose his present Mo∣deration, and his forced Inclinati∣ons now imprisoned, by the con∣siderations of Safety and Interest, may burst out and discover them∣selves.</P>
<P>In this manner Father <HI>Grueber</HI> answered to our Questions; we had a great desire to inquire of other Matters, concerning that remote Countrey; but in regard our con∣versation had lasted many hours, and that much of the night had been spent in this pleasing discourse, we thanked him for his great civili∣ty, and withdrew to our Lodg∣ings.</P>

<HEAD>Observations of the Travels of Father <HI>J. Grueber,</HI> taken out of the Letters which he hath written in Latine to <HI>Kircherus.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the Year One thousand six hundred sixty one, in the Moneth of <HI>June,</HI> these Fathers travelled out of <HI>Pekin,</HI> and in thirty days they arrived at <HI>Siganfú</HI> and from thence they went to <HI>Sining</HI> or <HI>Siningfu,</HI> in as many more, having twice passed the River <HI>Hoang.</HI> This City of <HI>Si∣ning</HI> or <HI>Siningfu,</HI> is a great City full of Inhabitants, scituate near the prodigious Wall of <HI>China;</HI> through its Gates all Merchants and Passen∣gers, out of <HI>India,</HI> must pass to en∣ter into <HI>Cathaia</HI> or <HI>China,</HI> and where they must rest, until they have got, from the King, a Passport to proceed further.</P>
<PB N="94" REF="49"/>
<P>This City is in Thirty six Degrees and ten Minutes from the Pole. From <HI>Sining</HI> they went in three Moneths time through <HI>Kalmuck,</HI> a Wilderness of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> to the Bord∣ers of the Kingdom of <HI>Lassa,</HI> which the <HI>Tartars</HI> call <HI>Barantola.</HI> This Wilderness is in some places Moun∣tainous, in others plain, full of Sand and Gravel; and therefore is barre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and unfruitful: Nevertheless, Na∣ture hath allowed some few Rivers to water it; upon their Banks there is very good Grass for Cattle. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Desart stretches it self from t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Southern part of <HI>India,</HI> to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Northern, and is so large, that n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ver any body yet, that I could find did ever survey its bounds; som<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> think that it reacheth as far as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Frozen Seas. It hath many name<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>P. Marcus Venetus</HI> names it the De∣sart of <HI>Lop,</HI> famous for the ordinar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> apparitions of Devils and Spirits <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but the Fathers of our Society mak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="95" REF="49"/>no mention of it, although these Spirits have oftentimes discovered themselves: He does not approve of their continuance and constant ap∣pearing to all. The <HI>Tartars</HI> did an∣tiently call it <HI>Belgian,</HI> afterwards <HI>Somo,</HI> the <HI>Chineses Kalmuck,</HI> others <HI>Caracathai,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Black Ca∣thaia,</HI> where no Animal is to be seen but wilde Beeves of an extraordi∣nary bigness.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> that are used to the Desarts, venture through at any time; and when they come to the Rivers that afford any feeding for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Cattel, there they commonly pitch their Tents, capacious enough to shelter Man and Beast.</P>
<P>From <HI>Lassa,</HI> otherwise named <HI>Barantola,</HI> situate in twenty nine degrees and six minutes from the Pole, they came in four days to the Foot of the Mountain <HI>Langur.</HI> This Mountain is one of the highest of the World; so that when Travel∣lers
<PB N="96" REF="50"/>pass over its top, they can scarce draw their breath, because of the subtilty of the Air. The breath of several venomous Herbs render a passage this way in Summer, to be very dangerous to our health. This Mountain is so full of grievous Pre∣cipices, and steep Rocks, that nei∣ther Cart nor Horse can pass over it therefore all Passengers are force<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to march a foot, for a moneths time<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> till they come to <HI>Cuth,</HI> the firs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Town of the Kingdom of <HI>Nekbal▪</HI> upon the Borders.</P>
<P>Although this Region is so moun∣tainous and difficult to pass ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Nature hath furnished it with seve∣ral Springs of hot and of cold Wa∣ter, that burst out of the Concavi∣ties. Here is in some places plenty of Fish for Men, and Grass for Cat∣tel. I think this is the Hilly Region which <HI>Ptolomy</HI> saith, that it lies un∣der the Mount <HI>Caucasus,</HI> and stretch∣eth it self a great way into the East
<PB N="97" REF="50"/>Countrey, and then divides into ranks of Hills; the one tends to the North, the other to the South. He calls it <HI>Parapanismus,</HI> and <HI>P. Mar∣cus Venetus, Belor.</HI> Other Nations do give other names to these Hills that border upon their several Countreys.</P>
<P>From <HI>Cuth,</HI> in five days journey, they came to the City <HI>Nesti,</HI> belong∣ing to the Kingdom of <HI>Nekbal,</HI> where the Inhabitants live in a most grievous Idolatry, without the least knowledge of Christianity. This place abounds in all manner of things necessary for the life of Man; so that you may have thirty or forty Hens for a crown.</P>
<P>From <HI>Nesti</HI> they travelled in six days, to the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of the King∣dom of <HI>Nekbal,</HI> called <HI>Cadmendu,</HI> lying in twenty seven degrees and five minutes from the Pole. The King is a great Prince, and a Hea∣then, but no Enemy to Christianity.</P>
<PB N="98" REF="51"/>
<P>From <HI>Cadmendu,</HI> in half a day, they went to <HI>Nekbal,</HI> the cheif City of the Kingdom, which is called also <HI>Baddan;</HI> and from thence, in five days, they arrived at the City <HI>Hedonda,</HI> belonging to the Kingdom of <HI>Maranga,</HI> situate in twenty six degrees and thiry six minutes from the Pole. From thence, in eight days, Travellers go to <HI>Mutgari,</HI> the first City upon the confines of the Kingdom of <HI>Mogol.</HI> From <HI>Mutgari,</HI> they went to <HI>Battana,</HI> a Town of the Kingdom of <HI>Bengala,</HI> situate up∣on the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> in twenty five degrees and forty four minutes. From <HI>Battana,</HI> in eight days, they came to <HI>Benares,</HI> a populous Town near the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> lying in twenty four degrees and fifty mi∣nutes. It is a noted place, for there are the Schools of the <HI>Brachmans,</HI> where all the Sciences, professed in those Countreys, are taught, and
<PB N="99" REF="51"/>with them, the most abominable Su∣perstitions.</P>
<P>From <HI>Benares,</HI> there are eight days journey, to <HI>Catampor;</HI> and from thence to <HI>Agra,</HI> seven more.</P>
<P>From <HI>Pekin</HI> to <HI>Agra,</HI> Men go in 214 days. But when they go no faster then the <HI>Carravans,</HI> they are four∣teen moneths in their journey.</P>
<P>This Relation I had from the Fa∣thers of our Society, who gave me this account of their Journeys.</P>
<P>These Kingdoms were never known by any in <HI>Europe</HI> before, nor to the Geographers. In their passage they took notice of many particu∣lars concerning the Customs and Manners of the several Inhabi∣tants.</P>
<P>From <HI>Pekin,</HI> the Imperial City of <HI>China,</HI> they travelled in two moneths to the famous Walls of that Coun∣trey, where the great City <HI>Sining∣fu</HI> is situate, as a strong Bulwark against the <HI>Tartars</HI> invasions. They
<PB N="100" REF="52"/>took great notice of the Walls, that are as strongly built, as the conve∣niencies of that place will afford. This Wall is so large, that six Hors∣men may ride upon it, in a brest, without hindering one another. They are often visited by the In∣habitants of <HI>Siningfú,</HI> to receive the benefit of the fresh Air, which comes off from the Sandy Moun∣tains of the Neighboring Desart; and to exercise themselves in walk∣ing and delighting their eyes, with the pleasant Prospects; for they are so high, that they discover the Countrey round about, and invite the Citizens to take a view of the delightful objects that appear be∣fore them: There is a very easie ascent up to this high Wall.</P>
<P>Its length from this City, to the other Gate, by which Men come out of the Desarts into the Town of <HI>Sucien,</HI> is about eighteen days journey; many, out of curiosity, as
<PB N="101" REF="52"/>well as out of necessity of business, undertake this journey. For that purpose they get a Passport from the Governor of <HI>Siningfú,</HI> and provide themselves with sufficient victuals. They say, that in this delightful pil∣grimage, they may see an infinite number of dwellings in their way, in the <HI>China</HI> side, which they dis∣cover as from a high Mountain; but on the other side, towards the great and spacious Wilderness, as the Inhabitants have told them, there are all manner of wilde Beasts to be seen, <HI>Tigers, Lions, Elephants, Rhinocerots, Leopards, Wilde Bulls, Monocerots;</HI> this last sort are a kind of <HI>Asses</HI> with Horns in their Fronts. The beholders may from hence, without fear of danger, please them∣selves with many strange and un∣usual sights of furious Beasts, espe∣cially from that part of the Wall that is towards the South, in the most inhabited places near to <HI>Quam∣si,
<PB N="102" REF="53"/>Junnam,</HI> and <HI>Tibet.</HI> From hence to the Yellow River, in the Coun∣trey adjoyning to the Wall, the wild Beasts hunt together in Com∣panies to seek for food in these places that are full of Brambles and Bushes.</P>
<P>When the Fathers of our Society were gone out of this prodigious Wall, into the Neighboring Wil∣derness, they found a small Stream of Water full of Fish, whereof they dressed a great quantity in their Tent, and kep some for another time. When they were passed over the Yellow River which runs out of the Wall, they entered into that vast Desart of <HI>Kalmak,</HI> full of un∣fruitful Mountains, and Fields most dreadful to behold; and in three moneths they arrived at the King∣dom of <HI>Barantola.</HI></P>
<P>Although this Wilderness be so solitary, and uninhabitable, it is fre∣quented by the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Kalmuk,</HI> at certain times of the year, when
<PB N="103" REF="53"/>the Grass appears upon the sides of the Rivers; then they transport their Portable Houses or Tents, and pitch them in such numbers toge∣ther, that any man would judge every company to be a City.</P>
<P>These <HI>Tartars</HI> take the liberty to march up and down, and plunder all that they can meet with; there∣fore it is necessary to be well armed against the violences of these Rogues, and to travel with a good <HI>Caravan.</HI> Our Fathers did often light upon several scattered com∣panies of them, as they travelled through this Wilderness.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lamae,</HI> who are the Priests of these <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Kalmak,</HI> are distinguishable by a Red Hat, a White Gown twisted behind, a Red Girdle, and a Yellow Tunick: At their Girdle there is a Purse that is fastned to it. They say, that the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Kalmak</HI> are cloathed with Skins, and a Yellow Cap;
<PB N="104" REF="54"/>their Women with Skins, or with Green or Red Stuffs; every one of them hath a Charm and Characters hung about their Necks, to pro∣tect them from evil spirits and witchcraft. They lodge in the in∣nermost Room of the Tent, made up with portable Staves, but the outside is covered with a thick Wollen Cloath and tied with Ropes. When their <HI>Lamae</HI> are at their Devotions, their Bigots, there present, roul about a Wheel, and handle it as a Scepter.</P>
<P>They have given the description of <HI>Han,</HI> a deceased King of <HI>Tanguth,</HI> whom they say had fourteen Sons, and for his Goodness and Justice in governing his Kingdom, the Inha∣bitants have honored him as a god, in their Countrey fashion. He is said to have been of a Tawny coun∣tenance, he had a Beard of a Ches∣nut colour, and Eyes like unto Dogs-eyes, swelling out of his Head.</P>
<PB N="105" REF="54"/>
<P><HI>Tanguth</HI> is a large Kingdom of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> these Father-Jesuites have travelled through a great part of it.</P>
<P>At that time, in the Court of <HI>Dena,</HI> King of <HI>Tanguth,</HI> there was a Woman came from the Northern part of <HI>Tartary,</HI> that wore twisted Hair, in the manner of Ropes; her Head was adorned with Sea-shells, and her middle bound about with a Girdle. In the same place, some of the Courtiers were habited as Wo∣men, only their Cloaths were of a Red colour as their Priests.</P>
<P>Into these Kingdoms of <HI>Tanguth</HI> and <HI>Barantola,</HI> the Devils subtilty hath brought in a most abominable and horrid custom. They chuse a strong youth, stout, and lusty, and give him liberty at certain times of the year, to kill, with the weapons, that he hath for that purpose, Men, Women, and Children, that he meets in his way; and when they are
<PB N="106" REF="55"/>killed in this manner, they imagine that they are consecrated to their goddess <HI>Menipe,</HI> that they are in a most happy estate; and therefore the living render to their memories, particular honors.</P>
<P>The youth is cloathed with a Garment of several colours, he is furnished with a Sword, with Bow, Arrows, and a Quiver; he carries sometimes a Banner. At a certain season, he is transported with Fury, and possessed by the Spirit, unto whom he is consecrated; he flies in∣to the Streets, and rambles up and down; all that he meets, he kills, for none dare make him any resist∣ance.</P>
<P>This youth they call, in their Tongue, <HI>Buth,</HI> which word signi∣fies a <HI>Slayer.</HI> Whiles the Fathers were there, they had a sight of him habited in that manner as he is al∣ready described.</P>
<PB N="107" REF="55"/>
<P>In this large Kingdom of <HI>Tanguth,</HI> there are many Kingdoms included, first, <HI>Barantola,</HI> which is also called <HI>Lassa,</HI> the name of the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of that Kingdom. It hath a King of its own, miserably addicted to Paga∣nism. He worships many Heathen Idols, amongst whom <HI>Menipe</HI> is one of the cheif. Its head riseth up as a Sugar-loaf, in a monstrous manner. <HI>Kircherus</HI> hath promised to publish a discourse, more at large, of this and other Idols of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>Before this Idol, these people per∣form their Sacrifices with strange gestures, often repeating this excla∣mation, <HI>O Manipe mi hum, ô Ma∣nipe mi hum,</HI> that is, <HI>Manipe save us.</HI> Besides, these foolish Idolaters bring to their Idol, to ingratiate them∣selves with him, all kind of Meats; and observe many other abomi∣nable practices of the antient Hea∣thens.</P>
<PB N="108" REF="56"/>
<P>There is another Image of a false God to be seen in <HI>Barantola,</HI> which is so strange, that scarce any body will believe it; therefore I shall here give a more punctual account of it.</P>
<P>The said Fathers, <HI>Grueber</HI> and <HI>d'Orville</HI> affirm, that whiles they waited at <HI>Barantola,</HI> about two Moneths, until a <HI>Caravan</HI> was ready to march, they took great notice of the Peoples Manners and Customs, whereof some were ridiculous, and some most abominable.</P>
<P>In this Kingdom there are two Kings, the one is imployed about the Government of the Kingdom, and is named <HI>Dena;</HI> the other is re∣tired from all worldly affairs; he lives idle in the secret Chambers of his Pallace, and is adored and wor∣shipped as a god; not only by the Natives, but also by all the Kings of <HI>Tartaria,</HI> subject to this King∣dom; for they come to him in pil∣grimage.
<PB N="109" REF="56"/>They name him their eternal and heavenly Father, and reverence him as the true and living God, by offering to him great pre∣sents. He sits in an obscure and dark place of his Pallace, adorned with Gold and Silver, upon a Bed raised on high; under his feet rich Carpets are spred, and round about him many Lamps stand lighted. When strangers come to him, they fall upon their faces, they creep to him upon their knees, and kiss his feet, as the Papists do the toes of their Pope, with a wonderful re∣spect.</P>
<P>From hence we may discover the Devils subtilty, in appropriating this ceremony and testimony of re∣spect due to none on Earth, but to the Pope of <HI>Rome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Here Mr. <HI>Jesuite</HI> speaks as a Papist.</NOTE> to the barbarous Super∣stitions of this Idola∣trous Nation. He hath had the malice to transfer and usurp all the other
<PB N="110" REF="57"/>mysteries of our Faith to his own Worship. As the Papists call the Pope, the Father of all Spiritual Fa∣thers; so these Idolaters call this Demy-God, <HI>The great Lama,</HI> or <HI>The High Priest,</HI> or <HI>The Lama of Lamas;</HI> that is, The Priest of Priests: For all their Religion and Idolatry de∣pends upon him; therefore they honor him with the title of <HI>Eternal Father.</HI> And that by his decease, his weakness and mortality might not appear, the Inferior <HI>Lamae,</HI> and other Priests only are admitted to attend upon him, to procure him whatsoever he stands in need of, to receive his commands, and deliver them as Oracles of the Divinity to the simple Pilgrims.</P>
<P>These men after his death, are wont to seek another, as like him in feature and stature as they can; him they lift upon the Throne. By this means the whole Kingdom, un∣acquainted with the manner of the
<PB N="111" REF="57"/>deceit, firmly believes that he is risen again to them, from the dead, seven times; and that he shall con∣tinue for ever. This perswasion is so fixed in their minds, blinded with the Devils illusions and deceits, that there is none questions it. There∣fore he is worshipped by all in a signal manner. Every one esteems him happy indeed, who can prevail so much upon the goodness of the inferior <HI>Lamae,</HI> his attendants, as to get something that hath but touched his body, or been taken from him, which they bear about their necks. For that purpose they load them with many rich gifts to obtain this their desire. O abomina∣ble and filthy blindness! By these Relicks, they imagine themselves protected against all manner of evils.</P>
<P>This the said Fathers under∣stood, to their great grief, from the Inhabitants of <HI>Barantola.</HI> It is true,
<PB N="112" REF="58"/>the Fathers did not see this great <HI>Lama,</HI> because none is admitted that makes profession of the Chri∣stian Religion; and there are many previous Ceremonies full of Ido∣latry to be practiced, before any man can be permitted to go near him, but they saw his Picture at the Entry in of the Kings Palace; unto which, as much reverence is paid, when but represented in Pictures and Images, as if he were there in person, by these Idolaters. His au∣thority is so great all over <HI>Tartaria,</HI> that there is no King that offers to take upon him his royal Scepter, but he sends first his Ambassadors with rich presents to the great <HI>Lama,</HI> to obtain his blessing for his happy and prosperous reign.</P>
<P>They saw also at <HI>Barantola</HI> some strange Women, of a Neighbor King∣dom called <HI>Coïn,</HI> one old and the other young: Women of an anci∣ent Nobility fold up their Hair in a
<PB N="113" REF="58"/>bundle, and cast them behind their backs. Upon their foreheads they wear a red Ribbon, adorned with Pearl, but on their heads a Silver Crown, in the shape of a Box, em∣bellished with <HI>Turkoises</HI> and <HI>Cor∣ral.</HI></P>
<P>They arrived next from <HI>Baranto∣la</HI> to the Kingdom of <HI>Nekbal,</HI> through a difficult way that leads over one of the highest Mountains of the World, named <HI>Langur,</HI> which we have already described. They found all things there needful to the life of Man, but only the knowledge of Christianity; for the Natives are all involved in the thick mists of the Heathens ignorance.</P>
<P>The cheif Towns are <HI>Cuthi</HI> and <HI>Nesti;</HI> the Custome of the Inhabi∣tants is, when any drink to Women, other persons pour into the Cup their liquor called <HI>Chà,</HI> or Wine, three times, and observe other ri∣diculous ceremonies.</P>
<PB N="114" REF="59"/>
<P>There is another custome practised here most horrid and barbarous, they bring out into the open field, and leave upon the ground, in the cold and wet, without any pitty, such as are desperately sick and near death; and when they are dead they suffer them to be devoured by the wild Fowl, by the Wolves and Dogs; for they look upon this namely the stomachs of living Ani∣mals, to be the most glorious Monu∣ments that their dead Corps ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pretend to.

<P>The King was very kind to these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>athers, cheifly because they gave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im some Prospective Glasses, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had never seen before, and some other curious trifles which surprised <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m in such a manner, that he re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lved to detain these Fathers with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m, and would not suffer them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epart, until they had solemnly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>omised to return; which if they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, he ingaged to assign them an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouse, which he would build for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eir use, to allow them a sufficient <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>elihood, and full liberty to pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gate their faith in any part of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ngdom.</P>

<HEAD>The most noted Passages of the Raign of the <HI>French</HI> King.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>He <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Monar∣chies seldom live long in Peace. Either the Interest of the Kingdoms, or the jealousies of State, or the humors of the People, or the na∣tural aversions and animosities which they have received by inhe∣ritance from their Forefathers, do frequently kindle the flames of War. Their Neighborhood and continual Conversation furnishes them with many occasions of distastes and dis∣putes;
<PB N="120" REF="62"/>for both the <HI>Spaniard</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> have no compliance nor respect for one another. They are naturally proud and high-minded, they pretend both to the Universal Monarchy, and think all the World must bow and creep to their great∣ness. I intend not to examine in this short Tract, the causes of their frequent Ruptures and Wars, I shall confine my discourse within the Borders of the <HI>French</HI> Domini∣ons, where we must visit the King and Court, and see what hath hap∣ned worthy of our observation up∣on that famous Theater of <HI>Europe.</HI> I design not so much to satisfie the <HI>Readers</HI> curiosity, as to furnish him with that knowledge which he may improve to his advantage; for in every capacity true and impartial History tends to our right informa∣tion and direction, God by his pro∣vidence teacheth men as well as by his Word. It concerns us not to
<PB N="121" REF="62"/>neglect the means that he affords for our instruction. And there is no∣thing more required in men that pretend to learning and perfection, then to be acquainted with the late and present Affairs, as well as with those that we have received from our Forefathers Relations.</P>
<P>It is very observable, that the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> seldom con∣clude Peace without a Marriage. The old Fable of <HI>Mars</HI>'s Adultery or Conjunction with <HI>Venus,</HI> is a practice so ordinary amongst them, that it needs no proof. In the year One thousand six hundred and fif∣teen, the Polititians of both King∣doms were resolved to conclude their disputes, and reunite their in∣terests in a Marriage between <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth, sirnamed <HI>The Just,</HI> and <HI>Anne</HI> of <HI>Austria, Infanta</HI> of <HI>Spain.</HI> Both Kingdoms expected from these two hopeful Princes, a numerous posterity; but to the
<PB N="122" REF="63"/>great disappointment of their Sub∣jects, and of all <HI>Europe,</HI> they lived together three and twenty years without Children. Success follows not always our best endeavors. At last in the Moneth of <HI>September,</HI> One thousand six hundred thirty and eight, the Queen was brought to Bed of a brave lusty Boy, who was saluted and welcomed into the World by the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> with the name of <HI>Dieu-donnè, Given of God:</HI> For they were verily per∣swaded, that his Birth and Concep∣tion had been miraculous, in regard of the indisposition of his Father. To strengthen this perswasion, the more by Cardinal <HI>Mazarines</HI> con∣trivance, then the <HI>Factotum</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> the King, the Queen, and the whole Court had been in Pro∣cession, with much devotion, bare∣footed, to the Chappel of the Vir∣gin <HI>Mary,</HI> near <HI>Paris,</HI> to desire from her, a Son and Heir to the Crown o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="123" REF="63"/><HI>France.</HI> Therefore the <HI>French</HI> look upon this Prince, as the effect and return of their Prayers, then so∣lemnly offered up to the Blessed Virgin; for within a year after, the King and Queen were blessed with this hopeful Child, to the greater joy of <HI>France,</HI> then of some of the Blood Royal, who had promised to themselves the Kingdom, in case <HI>Lewis</HI> the Thirteenth did die with∣out issue. Their discontents remain∣ed long concealed in private, and were not suffered to break out into a Publick War, by the good order that the Cardinal gave to the Affairs of the Kingdom, and by their re∣spect for the King, then alive. But afterwards, when they saw <HI>Lewis</HI> in his Grave, the People dissatisfied, and the Grandees discontented, with the <HI>Italian</HI> Government, they pro∣claimed their displeasures at the Head of an Army, with the loud noise of Drums, Trumpets, and
<PB N="124" REF="64"/>Cannon; as we shall see by and by.</P>
<P>As soon as the <HI>Dolphin</HI> was inau∣gurated into his Principality, and initiated into Christian Religion, they gave him his Attendants and Officers, according to his quality and Birth; the two cheif were his Governess — a Lady of a no∣ble spirit, and <HI>Hardouin de Perefixe,</HI> afterwards Bishop of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> and since removed to the Archbishoprick of <HI>Paris,</HI> was his Governor and Tutor. He is a great Polititian, Wise, and Learned, very affable and courteous. Whiles he lay in his Cradle, we can find nothing wor∣thy of our notice, but as soon as he stept out of it to walk alone, Pro∣vidence waited upon him, to put into his hands a Scepter, before he could manage it: For at four years of age, and a few Moneths, his Fa∣ther <HI>Lewis,</HI> sirnamed <HI>The Just,</HI> de∣parted this life, having published
<PB N="125" REF="64"/>before his Declaration, dated <HI>April</HI> 21. 1643. By which the Queen was appointed Regent, and Go∣verness of the whole Kingdom, the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> was her Lieute∣nant, and cheif of the Council. The Prince of <HI>Condé</HI> deceased, the Cardinal <HI>Mazarine,</HI> Monsieur <HI>Se∣guier,</HI> Chancellor of <HI>France,</HI> Mon∣sieur <HI>Bouthillier,</HI> and Monsieur <HI>Cha∣vigny;</HI> were to be of this Privy Council; but the conduct of the Army, then on foot, was left to the Duke of <HI>Enguien,</HI> who is now Prince of <HI>Condé.</HI></P>
<P>This Declaration settled the Af∣fairs of the Kingdom, and prevent∣ed the mischeif which might have hapned, in case the election of these great Officers of State had been left to the choice of such as might have designed to imbroil the King∣dom, for their own private ends. About a Moneth after, on the four∣teenth day of <HI>May,</HI> 1643. the King
<PB N="126" REF="65"/>died. At that time the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was attempting to inlarge his Do∣minions in the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> by a War with <HI>France.</HI> Don <HI>Francisco de Melo</HI> was Viceroy there, at the Head of an Army before <HI>Rocroy,</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Garrison, which he besieged in vain: For the Duke of <HI>Enguien,</HI> a young General, of twenty two years of age, came seasonably to its re∣lief, forced the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to a re∣treat, and obtained of them a no∣table victory on the nineteenth of <HI>May.</HI> All their Artillery was taken, with about threescore Colours; all their Bag and Baggage, and six thousand prisoners: The Colours were sent to <HI>Paris,</HI> to be presented to the new King, six days after his promotion to the Throne. The Viceroy behaved himself like a great Commander, he incouraged his men by his words, promises, and example; where he perceived the greatest danger, there did he hazard
<PB N="127" REF="65"/>his person, and his life; but when he saw the day lost, and the grie∣vous slaughter of his Soldiers, he found a way out of his Trenches, to retreat with the sad remains of his broken Army, and left his Enemy to glory in their Success, and to in∣rich themselves with his spoils. The Count <HI>de Fontaines</HI> was then grie∣vously incommoded with a disease; nevertheless, for the honor of his Master, he caused himself to be car∣ried in a Chair, during the fight, that he might assist his men with his Counsels, and incouragement; see∣ing he could not help them by his example. He purchased to himself much renown with the loss of his life; for he resolved to overcome or die. Therefore in the hurry and rout of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> whom he labored to keep to their Colours, he was killed by a mean hand.</P>
<P>This victory gave a check to the designs of the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> of
<PB N="128" REF="66"/>inlarging their Borders upon <HI>France.</HI> They had perswaded them∣selves, that the <HI>French</HI> had been dis∣couraged, during the sickness of the old King; and that they were not so able to make resistance in the mi∣nority of the new; for commonly, Factions and private Interests, raign in all Courts and Armies, when the Prince hath not attained to the age and ability of managing his own affairs. But it hath been ob∣served, that when men intend to advantage themselves by their Neighbors weakness, they find themselves disappointed at last, for providence makes use of the feeblest and most contemptible Agents to defeat the proudest purposes.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> General pursued the Enemy into his own Countrey, and took, from him, several small Forts and Towns, as <HI>Maubeuge, Borle∣mont, Aimmerikt, Binch,</HI> and <HI>Thion∣ville, &amp;c.</HI> So that they that had
<PB N="129" REF="66"/>flattered themselves of enjoying new Conquests, lost a small portion of their own Land. The Castle and Town of <HI>Cirke</HI> stopped the course of the victorious General; it was so well furnished with Men and Pro∣visions, and commanded by such a resolute Governor, that the threats of the <HI>French</HI> Army, the inconve∣niency of an approaching Siege, and the noise of the thundering Cannon, could not prevail upon him to yield to the first Summons, therefore it held out against the <HI>French</HI> several days; but when they had brought their Trenches to the Town Walls, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> heark∣ned to Conditions of Surrendring it up.</P>
<P>After this, the Duke of <HI>Enguien</HI> left the Army, about the latter end of <HI>August,</HI> to receive the Compli∣ments of the Court at <HI>Paris,</HI> for his great success in <HI>Flanders;</HI> but at his first arrival, the news of the
<PB N="130" REF="67"/>death of the Mareschal <HI>de Guebri∣ant,</HI> General of the <HI>French</HI> Forces in <HI>Germany,</HI> hastned him thither. He had been ingaged in a Battle against the Imperialists, on the seventeenth of <HI>November,</HI> where he was mortal∣ly wounded; for he died a few days after. The fight had been des∣perate between the <HI>Germans,</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> both lost a great many of their best men; so that the <HI>French</HI> Army was not able to hold the Field any longer, without the coming in of fresh and victorious Troops out of <HI>Flanders,</HI> with their young Ge∣neral <HI>Enguien.</HI> His coming restored heart and courage to the shattered Companies of the dead Mareschals Army. The <HI>French,</HI> who are always wont to boast much in their Suc∣cesses and Victories, and seldom or never to grant the loss of the day to their triumphing Enemies, de∣clare, That the Mareschal beat the <HI>Germans</HI> out of the Field. It is
<PB N="131" REF="67"/>certain they seised, a little after, upon <HI>Rotueil,</HI> a Frontier-Town, where the wounded Mareschal breathed forth his last gasp.</P>
<P>This War between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> had ingaged most Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> in the quarrel, the Trum∣pets sounded round about the Borders, in <HI>Savoy,</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> in <HI>Na∣varre, Catalonia, Flanders, Ger∣many, Alsatia, &amp;c.</HI> Armies and Armed Men did carry about, Death and Destruction.</P>
<P>In <HI>Italy,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> had three watchful Commanders, Prince <HI>Tho∣mas</HI> took from the <HI>Spaniard, Trin;</HI> the Marquess of <HI>Ville</HI> seised upon <HI>Ast;</HI> and the Count of <HI>Plessis-Pras∣lin</HI> invaded <HI>Estura,</HI> small places that would deserve no mention, if these Generals had but taken any more considerable Towns; but for want of stronger and more noted Garrisons, and braver exploits, the <HI>French</HI> must needs stuff their Relations
<PB N="132" REF="68"/>with the taking of these poor Ham∣lets. And the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> on their side, were not idle, they gained several places upon the <HI>French,</HI> but none of any importance.</P>
<P>In <HI>Catalonia,</HI> the Mareschal <HI>de la Mouthe Houdancour</HI> commanded as Viceroy, for the <HI>French,</HI> at the head of a small Army, with which, he drove the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from the Siege of <HI>Miravel</HI> and <HI>Flix;</HI> he made some inroads into the Kingdom of <HI>Arragon,</HI> and seised upon <HI>Almeras.</HI></P>
<P>In the same year, at Sea, as well as at Land, the affairs of War were carried on with much heat: The Duke of <HI>Brezè</HI> was Admiral for the <HI>French,</HI> in the <HI>Streights.</HI> He in∣gaged, with his Light Squadrons, against the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet, twice, once before <HI>Carthagena,</HI> in the Moneth of <HI>August;</HI> and another time, on the nineth day of <HI>September.</HI> In both Rencounters, the <HI>Armadoes</HI> ex∣changed a few Bullets, looked one
<PB N="133" REF="68"/>another in the face; but they were so scared with their Enemies fright∣ful countenances, and with the ap∣prehension of what might happen, if they continued too obstinately in the fight, that they were both willing to part upon equal terms; although the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniard</HI> both claim the Victory as their own.</P>
<P>When the War is once kindled between these two Nations, it is not one or two Campagnes can put a period to their disputes; no less then a River of the Subjects Blood must be spilled, to extinguish the flames. And it is observable, that all their Neighbors must dance at the sound of their Fiddles, and be interested in their quarrels. All the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> must attend up∣on them, and second their bloody designs. War like a Tempest, com∣monly riseth out of <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> then it spreds it self, and involves
<PB N="134" REF="69"/>all the Neighborhood into the same misery. Both Kingdoms are so po∣pulous and considerable, that when the Princes of either stir, all the bordering people move; they are forced in their own defence to have their Armies ready; which when they are so, Interest obliges them to employ them.</P>
<P>During this Winter, great prepa∣rations were making for the ensuing Spring of the year 1644. As soon as it appeared, the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> was appointed to command in <HI>Flan∣ders,</HI> where he besieged <HI>Graveling,</HI> which was surrendered to him, after a stout resistance of two moneths: He made his entry the Twenty nineth of <HI>July.</HI></P>
<P>This place was strong and well fortified, and the Key of <HI>Flanders,</HI> on that side; therefore the taking of it, did as much rejoyce the <HI>French,</HI> as it did grieve the <HI>Spaniard.</HI> After this success, the Mareschal of
<PB N="135" REF="69"/><HI>Gassion,</HI> Lieutenant General, had orders to march with his Army fur∣ther into the Enemies Countrey, where he took and pillaged some small Castles, the Abby of <HI>Vate,</HI> the Forts of <HI>Rebus, d'Henuin,</HI> and <HI>Arq.</HI> Some few <HI>Spanish</HI> Troops that were so unhappy as to come within his reach, were put to flight.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the Duke of <HI>Enguien</HI> was General in <HI>Germany;</HI> for that Countrey hath always been the Seat of War, when any is stir∣ring in <HI>Europe.</HI> At this time, the whole House of <HI>Austria</HI> that have so great a sway in that Climat, thought themselves ingaged to assist the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> their Brother, against the common Enemy the <HI>French.</HI> General <HI>Merci</HI> commanded the Army of the Duke of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> he was so successful to take <HI>Frie∣burgh</HI> from the <HI>French.</HI> As he was marching farther, to besiege some other place, the Duke of <HI>Enguien</HI>
<PB N="136" REF="70"/>met him with his Army, and in∣gaged three times on three several days; at last, the <HI>French</HI> forced them, after a notable slaughter, to a disorderly retreat. After this, many considerable Towns submitted to the conquering valor of the Duke of <HI>Enguien,</HI> and received, from him, Garrisons only to preserve their Territories from the spoil, which otherwise he would have made. <HI>Philipsbourgh,</HI> a strong Frontier Town, <HI>Vormes, Spire, Mayence, Burghen, Landau,</HI> and the Castle of <HI>Magdebourgh,</HI> were yielded up this Summer.</P>
<P>But before the year was over, the Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> agreed to send all their Plenipotentiaries to <HI>Munster,</HI> there to compose their differences, and agree in a General Peace; for <HI>Germany,</HI> and the Frontier Towns of the Empire had been so much impoverished; by the long and con∣tinual Wars, that as many died by
<PB N="137" REF="70"/>Famine, as formerly by the Sword. The only remedy was an Universal Peace, which was endeavored be∣tween all the Princes of Christen∣dom. The Queen Regent of <HI>France,</HI> sent thither the Count <HI>d' Avaux,</HI> and Monsieur <HI>Servien,</HI> to manage the <HI>French</HI> interest; afterwards the Duke of <HI>Longueville</HI> followed. The Treaty began in the Moneth of <HI>A∣pril,</HI> 1644. but could not be con∣cluded till the Twenty fourth of <HI>October,</HI> 1648. All the Monarchs of <HI>Europe</HI> agreed to lay down Arms, and to suffer their People to injoy the Blessings of Peace, only <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> had such differences as could not be composed, their pre∣tensions were so high, and so in∣tangled, That the greatest Politi∣tians that assisted at this composure of Affairs, could not find any ex∣pedient to bring them to an agree∣ment: Therefore the Ministers of other Princes did their business
<PB N="138" REF="71"/>without them. When they saw them so stiff, in not yielding to one another, they left them to them∣selves, and their Masters alone, to end their own quarrels, and fight till they were weary. That which administered new difficulties every day to this Peace, between the two Monarchies, was the prosecution of the War, which was so vigorously managed by the <HI>French,</HI> in the time of the Treaty, that in the begin∣ning of the Spring, 1645. they had five Armies on foot, in <HI>Flanders,</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> in <HI>Lorraine,</HI> in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> and in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>The Army of <HI>Flanders</HI> was com∣manded by the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> as <HI>Generalissimo;</HI> his Lieutenants were the Mareschals <HI>de Gassion,</HI> and <HI>Rant∣zau:</HI> At their passage over the Ri∣ver of <HI>Colme,</HI> there was a very hot dispute between the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards;</HI> but, in fine, the two Mareschals behaved themselves so
<PB N="139" REF="71"/>bravely, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was put to flight, and the passage opened. <HI>Mardike, Bourbourgh, Lillers, Be∣thune, Mount-Cassel, S. Venant, Me∣nenes,</HI> and <HI>Armentiers,</HI> were forced to yield. The Town of <HI>Lens</HI> was suddenly taken.</P>
<P>Upon the Borders of <HI>Germany,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Enguien,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> General, marched with his Troops as far as the <HI>Nekar,</HI> he took <HI>Rotem∣bourgh,</HI> and went next to find out his Enemies, the United Forces of the Empire, that were encamped about <HI>Nortlinguen,</HI> and <HI>Dunkespiel.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> had here a notable victory, Four thousand men were killed, with <HI>Merci,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Bavariaes</HI> General; <HI>Gleen,</HI> the Em∣perors General was taken, with all the Provisions, Artillery, Waggons, and above forty Colours. The Duke entertained <HI>Gleen</HI> very kindly, and set him at liberty; the Neighbor∣ing Towns, <HI>Nortlinguen</HI> and <HI>Dunkes∣piel,</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="72"/>were surrendered to the <HI>French,</HI> after the Battle. The Army had orders to march towards <HI>Hailbron,</HI> but the Duke fell dangerously sick; so that he was forced to withdraw, and be carried to <HI>Philipsbourgh.</HI> At this time, the House of <HI>Austria</HI> uni∣ted all its Forces under two Gene∣rals, the Archduke <HI>Leopold,</HI> and General <HI>Galaz.</HI> There were in this Army above Thirty thousand Men. Monsieur <HI>de Turenne,</HI> and the Mares∣chal of <HI>Grammont,</HI> commanded in the <HI>French</HI> Army, instead of the Duke <HI>d'Enguien;</HI> they had not a∣bove Twelve or thirteen thousand Men, yet they behaved themselves so gallantly, that the Imperialists could never come to fight them. They retreated with their Soldiers through their Enemies Countrey, and returned safe home into the Borders of <HI>France.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> Generals were highly commended for their Wisdom, in foreseeing the
<PB N="141" REF="72"/>danger of a General Battle; and for their care and prudence, in ma∣naging the Retreat to save their Men.</P>
<P>In <HI>Lorraine,</HI> the Mareschal <HI>de Vil∣leroy</HI> was sent with an Army to drive the Duke out of his Domi∣nions, because he had Confedera∣ted himself with the Enemies of <HI>France.</HI> The Inhabitants are natu∣rally inclined to favor the <HI>French,</HI> therefore they made no great resist∣ance, but submitted themselves to the King of <HI>Frances</HI> General, only <HI>La Mothe</HI> held out. Monsieur <HI>Ma∣galoty</HI> undertook to defend it; but his death caused it to be surrendred also: So that the poor Duke was driven out of all his Patrimony, by the overruling power of his Neigh∣bor.</P>
<P>In <HI>Catalonia,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> were no less successful for the General, the Count <HI>du Plessis-Praslin</HI> took <HI>Roses</HI> the nineteenth of <HI>May,</HI> and the
<PB N="142" REF="73"/>Count <HI>de Harcourt,</HI> Viceroy of <HI>Ca∣talonia,</HI> defeated the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in the Fields of <HI>Liorerys,</HI> and forced the Town of <HI>Balaguier</HI> to open its Gates. <HI>Du Plessis-Praslin</HI> was ho∣nored with the Staff of a Mareschal of <HI>France,</HI> for his good service to that Crown; and was commanded into <HI>Italy</HI> to assist Prince <HI>Thomas</HI> against the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> In the Duke∣dom of <HI>Milan, Viguerano</HI> was taken from them; but when the Prince was in his Retreat, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Ge∣nerals overpowered him; and had it not been for the seasonable com∣ing in of the new Mareschal, his Sol∣diers had been cut in pieces, and totally routed.</P>
<P>The next year 1646. the War was managed with the same fury as be∣fore, especially in <HI>Flanders,</HI> under the Dukes of <HI>Orleans</HI> and <HI>d'En∣guien,</HI> who laid siege, with a nume∣rous Army, well appointed, to the City of <HI>Courtray,</HI> which they took
<PB N="143" REF="73"/>in the presence of all the Forces of the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> that came with a design to raise the Siege. <HI>Mardike</HI> was again retaken from the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and <HI>Dunkirk</HI> was besieged by the Duke of <HI>Enguien. Caracena</HI> and <HI>Lambay</HI> were the <HI>Spanish</HI> Gene∣rals, but they did not dare to ad∣venture a pitcht Battle. The Mar∣quess of <HI>Leda,</HI> a famous and ex∣perienced Commander, was then Governor of this Town, that was well fortified by Nature as well as by Art. Nevertheless, the <HI>French</HI> won it in thirteen days, and forced the besieged to a Capitulation. Af∣ter this, Prince <HI>Thomas,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Brezé</HI> besieged, and took <HI>Orbiselle;</HI> but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were so strong in <HI>Italy,</HI> that the Court or∣dered the Mareschal <HI>de la Meilleray,</HI> and <HI>du Plessis-Praslin,</HI> with United Forces to march thither; they took two small places, <HI>Paombino</HI> and <HI>Por∣tolongone.</HI></P>
<PB N="144" REF="74"/>
<P>About this time, <HI>Henry de Bour∣bon,</HI> Prince of <HI>Condé</HI> died, the Six and twentieth of <HI>December,</HI> and his eldest Son, the Duke of <HI>Enguien</HI> succeeded him in his Principality, and to the honor of being the first Prince of the Blood Royal of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1647. the Mareschal <HI>de Gassion</HI> forced many places to submit; he was wounded at the siege of <HI>Lens,</HI> and carried to <HI>Arras,</HI> where he died. Monsieur <HI>Villequier</HI> commanded in his absence, and took the Town.</P>
<P>About this time the Duke of <HI>Brezé</HI> was killed over against <HI>Na∣ples,</HI> with a Cannon Bullet, and his Fleet was put to flight by the <HI>Spa∣nish Armado.</HI></P>
<P>But the misfortunes and ill suc∣cesses of the Duke of <HI>Guise,</HI> brought all his family to ruine. He had been sollicited by the Rebellious <HI>Neapo∣litans,</HI> to command their Army
<PB N="145" REF="74"/>against their lawful Prince. He too credulously trusted an unconstant Rabble, and went to <HI>Naples</HI> to manage a War against <HI>Spain,</HI> in that part of the World, and dispossess the House of <HI>Austria,</HI> of one of its best Kingdoms.</P>
<P>His first arrival was attended by some Successes, and the favor of the Inhabitants; but when the Court of <HI>France,</HI> out of a jealousie of his greatness, began to frown upon him, and deny the assistance which they had promised, and might have sent him; the <HI>Neapoli∣tans</HI> betrayed him to their old Masters for their own safety and pardon. He was carried into the Prisons of <HI>Spain,</HI> from whence he could scarce obtain his freedom in three years. This great disappoint∣ment brought the House of <HI>Guise</HI> to a low estate, together with some other miscarriages, that they have been guilty of.</P>
<PB N="146" REF="75"/>
<P>In this Campagne, <HI>Lerida,</HI> the strongest Bulwark upon the Borders of <HI>Spain,</HI> was streightly besieged by the Army of the Prince of <HI>Condé.</HI> The Count <HI>de Harcourt,</HI> had at∣tempted it the year before; but this place stood it out, till the last, so that the siege was raised to suc∣cor some other more considerable Town, which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was ready to carry.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Spring 1648. that dismal year for <HI>England,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Condé</HI> appeared again at the head of an Army in <HI>Flanders.</HI> where he took <HI>Ypres</HI> in twelve days; but before this siege was over, where the <HI>French</HI> Army suffered many wants, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had re∣covered <HI>Funes, Courtray,</HI> and <HI>Lens.</HI> These advantages had made them contemn their Enemies, command∣ed by the Prince: So that General <HI>Beck,</HI> assistant to the Arch duke <HI>Leo∣pold</HI> in his Army, assured him of a
<PB N="147" REF="75"/>full victory over the <HI>French.</HI> With this perswasion, they ventured to ingage, but the Troops of <HI>Lorraine</HI> were disordered in the Battle, and the Archdukes Cavalry were so miserably treated, that if the Prince <HI>de Ligny</HI> had not come in, with his reserve, the Archduke had been made prisoner. General <HI>Beck</HI> died with the displeasure of his ill suc∣cess, as well as by his wounds. This Battle was fought the twentieth of <HI>August;</HI> it caused several petty Towns to open their Gates, as <HI>Lens</HI> and <HI>Furnes, &amp;c.</HI> At this time, Ma∣reschal <HI>de Schomberg,</HI> the Kings Ge∣neral in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> took the Town of <HI>Tortoise,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Va∣lencia,</HI> and defeated the Army of <HI>Don Francisco de Melo,</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> General, that came to relieve it.</P>
<P>All these Sieges, Battles, and Ren∣counters, hapned during the Treaty at <HI>Munster,</HI> which excluded the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Spaniard.</HI> Their
<PB N="148" REF="76"/>quarrels alone could not be ended, for the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had intelligence of a secret Conspiracy in <HI>France,</HI> where the greatest Princes were concerned. He did therefore expect to recover what he had lost by the favor of the Domestick Wars, and troubles of his Neighbors. The Prince of <HI>Condé,</HI> and many more of the Blood Royal were united together, they publish∣ed their <HI>Manifesto</HI> to justifie their taking up Arms to reform the Go∣vernment, as was pretended, and to remove the Cardinal from that great trust reposed in him by the Queen. <HI>Paris</HI> held for the Rebels, and many other Towns were in dan∣ger of following the same example. The Inhabitants were more then usually scurrilous and scandalous against the King, the Queen, and the Cardinal. These troubles had almost deprived the young King of his Crown and Scepter, had it not been for the seasonable assistance
<PB N="149" REF="76"/>and kind Mediation of our great Monarch, and the vigorous endea∣vors of the Mareschal <HI>de Turenne,</HI> more faithful to his King then to his Religion.</P>
<P>At last after much Bloodshed in an intestine War, the Prince re∣treated into <HI>Flanders,</HI> with those of his party, whom neither Love, Loyalty, nor Interest, could per∣swade to guard their young King. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> put him at the Head of their Troops, with which he re∣covered almost all the Towns that he had formerly lost. If the Mares∣chal <HI>de Turenne</HI> had not stopped the progress of the Princes victories, he had invaded the Crown it self as well as the Frontier Towns. But after an absence of several years, the King invited him home, received him into his favor, bestowed upon him his Government, and Employs, and treated the Dukes of <HI>Conti,</HI> and <HI>Longueville,</HI> in the same generous
<PB N="150" REF="77"/>manner, publishing a General Par∣don to all other offenders in the Civil Wars.</P>
<P>On the Seventh of <HI>September,</HI> 1651. the King being thirteen years old, was declared of Age, sufficient to take upon him the Government, and to begin to act in person, in that sphere where providence had put him. The Declaration was approved of in the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> and proclaimed all over the Land.</P>
<P>The War continued still between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> In the years 49, 50, 51, and 52, the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had the greatest Successes against the <HI>French;</HI> for they were assisted by the Sedition and Treachery of the Inhabitants, as much as by their own valor and numbers of Men, to recover more then they had former∣ly lost. But after the Kings majo∣rity, he appeared himself at the head of his Troops, and, with his presence, gave them so much cou∣rage
<PB N="151" REF="77"/>and resolution, that they turn∣ed the fortune of War. The City of <HI>Bar,</HI> and the Castle of <HI>Ligny,</HI> was surrendred to the Mareschal <HI>de la Ferté,</HI> in 1653. The Duke of <HI>Esper∣non</HI> besieged <HI>Bellegard,</HI> but could not take it, till the news was come, that the King was in the Camp; then the Governor was loath to stand it out against his own Prince. <HI>Rethel</HI> and <HI>Mouzon</HI> were retaken by Monsieur <HI>Turenne, St. Menehou</HI> by <HI>la Ferté,</HI> the twenty seventh of <HI>November. Du Plessis Praslin</HI> be∣haved himself so gallantly in taking this place, that the King gave it him to command. <HI>Grancey</HI> surprised <HI>Castillon,</HI> and withstood the valo∣rous efforts of General <HI>Caracena.</HI></P>
<P>The year 1654. was honored with the greatest solemnity, and most sacred Ceremony of <HI>France,</HI> the Coronation of their King at <HI>Rheims,</HI> with that holy Oyl which they affirm to be faln from Heaven,
<PB N="152" REF="78"/>and sent from God for that purpose, to anoint their Kings therewith. When they have been thus inaugu∣rated, the people have a particular respect for their persons.</P>
<P>After this, <HI>Stenay</HI> was besieged by the <HI>French,</HI> commanded by Mares∣chal <HI>d' Hocquincourt;</HI> when the <HI>Spa∣niard</HI> saw they could not hinder the taking of this place, they labored to make a Diversion, and to recom∣pence themselves for their loss, by the invasion of <HI>Arras. Turenne, la Ferté,</HI> and <HI>Hocquincourt,</HI> had orders to hazard all, rather then to suffer this great City to fall into their hands. When they had called a Council of War, they resolved to attack the Lines and Trenches, which they did with much resolu∣tion, in the night, the 24 and 25 days of <HI>August. Hocquincourt</HI> en∣tered first into the Enemies Camp, through the Troops of the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> but he was beaten back
<PB N="153" REF="78"/>with a great slaughter of his Men; the other Commanders relieved, and seconded him: So that at last the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was forced to leave his Trenches with some loss of Men, of Ammunition, and Baggage: For the Governor of the Town sallied out at the same time, and recei∣ved so much assistance, that the Enemy despaired of being able to gain the Walls. The <HI>Spanish</HI> Gene∣ral preserved his Army by a season∣able retreat, which was managed with that prudence and courage, that he hath worthily deserved the admiration of his Enemies. The King went to visit his Camp and Army immediately after this Siege was raised, to encourage and reward his brave Soldiers.</P>
<P>In <HI>Catalonia</HI> also, the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> had some success in taking <HI>Conflans</HI> and <HI>Cerdagne</HI> from the <HI>Spa∣niard.</HI> About the beginning of the Spring 1655. <HI>Landrecy, Maubeuge,
<PB N="154" REF="79"/>Condé,</HI> and <HI>St. Guilham,</HI> submitted themselves again to the <HI>French</HI> Mo∣narchy. Thus these small places were often taken and retaken by the Armies of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France.</HI> At every advantage, in the Field, these weaker Towns, of no resistance, were forced, for their preservation, to prefer their Safety to their Loyal∣ty, and to side with the strongest party.</P>
<P>In this year there was a League Offensive and Defensive, made be∣tween <HI>Cromwel</HI> and <HI>Mazarin,</HI> a∣gainst <HI>Spain,</HI> upon conditions dis∣graceful to the King and Court of <HI>France.</HI> Monsieur <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> solli∣cited his Masters Affairs so notably, that he got that Arch-Rebel to send over, in the beginning of the Spring 1656. an Army of stout Soldiers, commanded by <HI>Reynolds.</HI> For al∣though <HI>France</HI> abounds in Men, it is wont to make use of the valor of its Neighbors, in all Wars, against
<PB N="155" REF="79"/>strangers: For it hath been found, by experience, that the <HI>French</HI> are good for the first Onset, but cannot abide nor weather so many discourage∣ments, as the <HI>English, Scotch,</HI> and <HI>Switzers</HI> can in War; besides their Foot are not to be compared to ours. Therefore they may ascribe their most difficult Conquests to their Money, and to the <HI>English, Scotch, Irish,</HI> and <HI>Switzers</HI> valor; as we shall see in several late Encount∣ers with the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and <HI>Imperia∣lists.</HI></P>
<P>The year 1656. was noted for the remarkable Siege of <HI>Valancien∣nes,</HI> where the <HI>French</HI> received an overthrow, and were forced to quit the place; but afterwards they took <HI>Cappelle</HI> and <HI>Valencia</HI> in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>In the beginning of the Cam∣pagne 1657. <HI>Montmedy</HI> was be∣sieged by <HI>la Ferté,</HI> the King him∣self went thither, after that the Suc∣cors which were intended for a re∣lief,
<PB N="156" REF="80"/>were happily routed. After∣wards the City yielded to his Ma∣jesty, and opened its Gates to re∣ceive him on the seventh of <HI>August. St. Venant, Bourbourg,</HI> and the Fort of <HI>Mardike,</HI> also were taken by <HI>Turenne.</HI> Our <HI>English</HI> served him in good stead in the recovering of these places, especially in storming of <HI>Mardike.</HI> The attempt was not e∣steemed feasable by the <HI>French</HI> Ge∣neral, who had a design rather to besiege it, then to win it by an As∣sault. But our <HI>English</HI> Commanders undertook this perillous attempt, Sir <HI>Tho. Morgan,</HI> now Governor of <HI>Jersey,</HI> lead his Party with so much courage and resolution, that they recovered the top of the Walls in an instant, passing through showers of shot and fire, to the great asto∣nishment of the rest of the Army. This Gentleman hath purchased to himself the name and honor of one of the bravest Soldiers of <HI>Europe.</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="80"/>And when the <HI>Spaniard</HI> ventured in the night to surprise this Fort again, the <HI>English</HI> saved it, beat back the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and obliged them to a speedy retreat to <HI>Dunkirk.</HI> After this <HI>Turenne</HI> was employed with a Flying Party to raise the Siege of <HI>Ardres,</HI> which he did with so much bravery, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> received there a considerable loss.</P>
<P>But all these Conquests were in∣considerable to those of the next year 1658. <HI>Turenne</HI> and <HI>La Ferté</HI> were the two Generals of the <HI>French,</HI> and after the death of <HI>Rey∣nolds,</HI> drowned near <HI>Goodwin Sands,</HI> in a small Boat in which he ventured to pass from <HI>Mardike</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> my Lord <HI>Lockart,</HI> then Ambassador at <HI>Paris,</HI> took the charge of the <HI>English</HI> Forces. The Army was com∣manded to besiege <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> for it had been agreed between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> that this place should be put into the <HI>English</HI> hands. It
<PB N="158" REF="81"/>was surrounded the Twenty fifth of <HI>May;</HI> which when the Marquess of <HI>Leda</HI> had notice of, he shut himself in, with a strong Garrison, resolving to defend it, or die there. The Siege was carried on very resolutely, the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Armies made their approaches on a sudden; so that the fear of loosing this strong place, caused the Archduke to en∣deavor to raise the Siege by assault∣ing them in their Trenches. <HI>Turenne</HI> confided in his own strength, there∣fore when he heard of the Enemies approach, he marched bravely out of his Camp to meet the Archduke, the victory declared for the <HI>French.</HI> In this encounter, it was the unhap∣piness of the <HI>English</HI> to fight with their own Countrey-men. In the <HI>Spanish</HI> Army, the Noble and Cou∣ragious Duke of <HI>York,</HI> a Prince of an invincible resolution, was enter∣tained by the <HI>Spaniard</HI> as one of the best Commanders of that Army.
<PB N="159" REF="81"/>That wise Nation, as well know∣ing in Men as in Affairs, would not suffer so great a Courage idle, in time of War. If I might have the liberty in this succinct Narration, I could give an account of the most heroick actions of his Royal High∣ness; insomuch, that <HI>Turenne,</HI> and the other Generals, have often con∣fessed him to be the ablest and most skilful Commander of the World. His Courage and Wisdom had not that success that could have been expected at this time; for the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> Regiments under my Lord <HI>Lockart,</HI> especially that of Colonel <HI>Alsop,</HI> beat back the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and pursued them over the Sandy Hills, with a great slaughter. This victory was due cheifly to the courage of the <HI>English,</HI> the fifteenth of <HI>June,</HI> 1658. After the Retreat of the <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Army returned to the Siege, where the Marquess of <HI>Leda</HI> was killed with a Bullet. After
<PB N="160" REF="82"/>his death the Town began to listen to terms of Surrendring, which were agreed on the Two and twen∣tieth of <HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>The King entered into the City, to take possession of it, afterwards he delivered it up to my Lord <HI>Lockart,</HI> for the use of the <HI>English,</HI> whose Blood and Valor had got it from the Enemy. <HI>Bergues, Furnes,</HI> and <HI>Dixmuyde,</HI> yielded also to the Kings Summons, so did <HI>Oudenard. Ypres</HI> staid for a Siege, and when the Prince of <HI>Ligny</HI> had gathered the Relicks of the Dispersed Army, beaten before <HI>Dunkirk,</HI> he labored to raise it; but was beaten off with loss by <HI>Turenne,</HI> who took after∣wards <HI>Menein,</HI> and many other small Castles.</P>
<P>At that time <HI>La Ferté</HI> assaulted <HI>Gravelin,</HI> but could not recover it in a Moneth, for the Garrison was strong and resolute. Many brave Actions hapned in this attempt, the
<PB N="161" REF="82"/>besiegers and besieged, behaved themselves very gallantly; at last they capitulated upon honorable terms, the Eight and twentieth of <HI>August.</HI></P>
<P>In the interim, the Dukes of <HI>Mo∣dena</HI> and <HI>Navailes,</HI> took <HI>Mortera</HI> for the <HI>French.</HI> This first hath always been devoted to the Crown of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniard</HI> endeavored to take from the <HI>French,</HI> some little places which they recovered; but it is certain, that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was the greater looser. Therefore the Princes of the Empire assembled, together to consult about the chu∣sing of another Emperor at <HI>Franck∣fort,</HI> sent to desire his Majesty of <HI>France,</HI> to hearken to an Accommo∣dation. The King of <HI>Spain, Philip</HI> the Fourth, had caused some Overtures of Peace to be made by the Popes Mediation. The <HI>French</HI> Court entertained them wil∣lingly
<PB N="162" REF="83"/>upon condition of a match, between the young King, and the <HI>Infanta of Spain.</HI> When the King was at <HI>Lions,</HI> an Envoy came to him from <HI>Madrid,</HI> about this Negotia∣tion. The Cardinal had orders to have a private Conference with him, to make way for the Ambassa∣dors <HI>de Lionne</HI> and <HI>Pimentel.</HI> The first was dispatched away to <HI>Ma∣drid,</HI> the second went to <HI>Paris.</HI> They dealt so effectually, that all Differ∣ences were composed, Articles were concluded, and the great breach was made up, to the satisfacti∣on of both Princes and Kingdoms. The Queen-Mother was not a little useful in this business; for when the Cardinal did seem to put in some Demurs, she declared, That the Peace should be made without him, for that she was resolved, that her Son should match with one of her own Kinred.</P>
<PB N="163" REF="83"/>
<P>The Kings indisposition had al∣most ruined this Affair, for he fell dangerously sick; but he recovered after a few days distemper. After∣wards he made a progress into the farthest confines of his Kingdom; for there had been some discontents and disorders about <HI>Lions, Burgun∣dy,</HI> and <HI>Provence,</HI> which could not be terminated without his coming. When he was at <HI>Lions,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> came to wait upon him. This Prince is so near a Neighbor to <HI>France,</HI> that he is forced to keep his friendship, for fear of loosing his Principality; which hath been seve∣ral times in great danger to be swal∣lowed up, by this great Monarch, at the least distaste.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the <HI>Spanish</HI> gra∣vity was very slow in concluding the Peace; that Court trifled away the time in Consultations and Meet∣ings, whilest the Spring of the next year 1659. was coming on apace.
<PB N="164" REF="84"/>Which caused the King to give or∣der for new levies of Soldiers, to appoint Generals and Commanders, as if he had intended to prosecute the War as vigorously as before. This made the <HI>Spaniard</HI> desire a Truce of four Moneths; from the eighth of <HI>March,</HI> to the third of <HI>July,</HI> which was granted the King, That it should continue till his Declaration to the contrary or∣dered.</P>
<P>In order to a Peace, <HI>Mazarin</HI> went to <HI>Bayonne,</HI> and <HI>Don Louïs d' Aro de Gusman</HI> came to S. <HI>Sebasti∣ans,</HI> to treat more commodiously. These two Plenipotentiaries at last concluded and signed the Articles the seventh of <HI>November</HI> next ensu∣ing. The Inhabitants of S. <HI>Sebastian,</HI> of S. <HI>John de Luz,</HI> and of the Neighboring Cities declared their satisfaction and joy, by Bonefires, and other publick signs.</P>
<PB N="165" REF="84"/>
<P>Whilst the business was in debate, the <HI>French</HI> Court was at <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> and <HI>Tholouse,</HI> that it might be sooner consulted in all difficult Matters. After the conclusion of the Treaty, the <HI>French</HI> King sent a Procuration to <HI>Don Louïs d' Aro,</HI> to espouse the <HI>Infanta of Spain</HI> in his name. The Marriage was performed in <HI>Fonta∣rabia</HI> in the presence of the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> the third day of <HI>June.</HI> The two Kings met in the <HI>Isle of Conference,</HI> scituate between both Kingdoms, where the young Queen was delivered to her Husband, and both Kings swore to keep, and con∣firmed to one another the Treaty of Peace.</P>
<P>After this interview, they separa∣ted; the <HI>French</HI> King and Queen was received at S. <HI>John de Luz,</HI> with much pomp and Joy; and in their journey to <HI>Paris,</HI> every good City in their way expressed their extra∣ordinary satisfaction, for the Marri∣age
<PB N="166" REF="85"/>and Peace between the two Kingdoms. But their Reception at <HI>Paris,</HI> was one of the most glorious Ceremonies, the most splendid Tri∣umph of our Age. The young Queen was carried in an open Char∣riot, shining with all the riches of the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West Indies;</HI> she was attended upon by the whole Court, in their greatest splendor and glory. The People, the Clergy, and the Nobility, did welcome her with such expressions of joy, that they are not credible.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the next year 1661. on the nineth of <HI>March,</HI> the great Minister of State, Cardinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> paid his last debt to <HI>Na∣ture,</HI> having, by his policy, raised himself and family from a low be∣ginning, to the greatest honors in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The Court was pleased to Mourn for him, but they quickly cast off their sad attire, when Monsieur of
<PB N="167" REF="85"/><HI>France</HI> resolved to marry with the Princess of <HI>England:</HI> A Lady, very well accomplished in <HI>Beauty</HI> and <HI>Vertue.</HI> The publick ceremony was performed on the One and thirtieth of <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>There hapned nothing remark∣able this year, till the latter end. The first day of <HI>November,</HI> the <HI>Dau∣phin</HI> of <HI>France</HI> was born, to the great joy of all that Kingdom, Mon∣sieur <HI>de Montausier</HI> was appointed to be his Governor.</P>
<P>One thousand six hundred sixty and two, the King made Seventy two Knights of the Order of the <HI>S. Esprit;</HI> all Persons of the greatest Nobility, and approved valor. In the same year there hapned a differ∣ence between the Ambassadors of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> about preceden∣cy, in the City of <HI>London.</HI> The <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> were prepared to receive the <HI>French;</HI> so that the tumult was great, and some Bloodshed on both sides.</P>
<PB N="168" REF="86"/>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> sent their Complaints to <HI>Madrid,</HI> the King gave them sa∣tisfaction, and forbad all his Ambas∣sadors for the future, to appear in any publick solemnity with the Ambassadors of <HI>France;</HI> for they claim a precedency in all Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> unless it be in <HI>Vienna,</HI> where the House of <HI>Austria</HI> are Lords. The King of <HI>Spain</HI> preferred in this occa∣sion, the Peace and Quiet of his Kingdoms to this odd <HI>Punctilio</HI> of Honor.</P>
<P>This year was spent in Sports and publick Divertisements of the Gen∣try and Nobility at court, till the Moneth of <HI>November.</HI> Then the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador in <HI>England,</HI> had Orders to demand the restitution of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> to the <HI>French,</HI> for a sum of Money, according to their pretend∣ed Agreement with <HI>Cromwel.</HI> It was generally supposed by the wisest in <HI>France,</HI> that the <HI>English</HI> would never part with a place so well fortified,
<PB N="169" REF="86"/>by their late industry, purchased with the Blood of many of their bravest Men that took it, and so handy and commodious to them, both in Peace and War; and that therefore there would be a dispute between the two Nations, for the recovery of it. But it hapned other∣wise, to the Universal Sorrow of all our people, <HI>Dunkirke</HI> was surren∣dered, and the <HI>French</HI> King made his entry into it the second day of <HI>December.</HI></P>
<P>There had been a Treaty be∣tween the old Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> and this young King, by which the Duke made over to him, all his Right, Title, and Interest, in the Dutchy of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> for some Lands in lieu of it; and for the priviledge of being declared Heir to the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> in case the Fa∣mily of <HI>Bourbon</HI> did fail. This A∣greement had been made the sixth of <HI>February,</HI> 1662. and confirmed
<PB N="170" REF="87"/>in the Parliament of <HI>Paris,</HI> in the Moneth of <HI>March.</HI> So that the <HI>French</HI> seised upon all the Cities and Countrey of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> only the strong Town of <HI>Marsal</HI> remained in the Dukes hands, who seemed un∣willing to deliver it. Besides the young Prince <HI>Charles</HI> of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> was supposed to have won the Sol∣diers there in Garrison, therefore they would not surrender it upon Summons.</P>
<P>This affair caused the King to tra∣vel into that Countrey, with a suffi∣cient Army, to reduce it to his obe∣dience, commanding that <HI>Marsal</HI> should be besieged without delay. His sudden motion surprised the Duke, and found him unprovided; therefore he went to meet his Ma∣jesty at <HI>Metz</HI> in <HI>Lorraine,</HI> to submit himself unto him. The King re∣ceived him very generously, and made him welcome; <HI>Marsal,</HI> accord∣ing to Agreement, was put into
<PB N="171" REF="87"/>the <HI>French</HI> hands, on the third of <HI>September,</HI> 1663.</P>
<P>A little before, the <HI>French</HI> Am∣bassador Monsieur <HI>de Crequi,</HI> had been affronted, and in danger of his person, in the City of <HI>Rome.</HI> Some of the Popes Guards shot into his Coach, and wounded his servants. When the Court of <HI>France</HI> heard of it, the King commanded the Popes <HI>Nuncio,</HI> then at <HI>Paris,</HI> to depart out of the Kingdom, and sent for his Generals, ordering them to pre∣pare for a War. <HI>Alexander</HI> the Se∣venth did then sit in S. <HI>Peters</HI> sup∣posed Chair. He sent immediately, upon the news of the coming of the <HI>French</HI> Army, an Express, to assure his Majesty, that he was much dis∣satisfied with the deed, and that he would give him all the satisfaction that he should desire. The City of <HI>Pisa</HI> was pitched upon to examine and discourse of this affair, where the Popes, and the <HI>French</HI> Deputies,
<PB N="172" REF="88"/>concluded it the Twelfth of <HI>March,</HI> 1664. to the great joy of the <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Catholicks. The Pope yielded to his own dishonor, that his Ne∣phew <HI>Flavio Chigi</HI> should wait up∣on the King, and beg his pardon, that a Monument should be erected in the very place, for posterity to gaze upon, with an Inscription, de∣claring the cause of its standing there. This was performed accord∣ingly; but the zeal of the <HI>French,</HI> for their King, and their concern∣ment for his honor, is very remark∣able in this occasion. The Parliament of <HI>Aix</HI> hearing of the affront given to the <HI>French</HI> Ambassador, and the Kings resolution to revenge it, made some levies of Men of their own accord, and marched to <HI>Avignon,</HI> where they drive out the Garrison, they surprised <HI>Carpentras,</HI> and all the Popes Territories near them. This action gave the King and Court great satisfaction, and facilitated an
<PB N="173" REF="88"/>Agreement between him and the Pope; for the <HI>French</HI> are not so wedded to their Superstitions, as to be so much afraid of the Popes thunderbolts as in former ages. It would become the wisdom of the Politicians of this Nation, to shake off the Popes burdensome Fetters, and establish a Patriarch of their own. There wants nothing else to make their King an absolute Mo∣narch. Some of the <HI>Jansenists</HI> have attempted to perswade their Clergy to it, I hope God will one day open their eyes, to perceive their slavery to S. <HI>Peters</HI> counterfeit Keys, and to oblige them to use that liberty unto which Providence invites them.</P>
<P>At the same time, that the Car∣dinal was in <HI>France,</HI> the Emperor desired the Kings Succors, to help him against the <HI>Turks,</HI> who had in∣vaded his Dominions. This motion pleased the <HI>French</HI> humor, for they
<PB N="174" REF="89"/>would be thought to be the Cham∣pions of Christianity against the Infidels. The King ordered, as some say, about Ten thousand Men to march under the command of Mon∣sieur <HI>de Coligny,</HI> and Monsieur <HI>de la Fueillade,</HI> who is now Duke of <HI>Roannez.</HI> This Army joyned with the Imperialists about the Moneth of <HI>June,</HI> 1665. they found out the <HI>Turks</HI> Army, and encountered with them twice. It is certain, the <HI>French</HI> behaved themselves very gallantly in this expedition; so that the Enemies were worsted, and in their retreat, over the River of <HI>Raab,</HI> they lost about Five thou∣sand Men that were slain, Sixteen pieces of Cannon, and about One hundred and fifty Colours were taken, with much of their Baggage. The rest of their Army fled, not be∣ing able to withstand the Christians valor.</P>
<PB N="175" REF="89"/>
<P>The Queen-Mother of <HI>France</HI> fell dangerously sick, and died the Twentieth of <HI>January,</HI> in that omni∣ous year One thousand six hundred sixty six. She was much lamented in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> for she was an excellent Princess.</P>
<P>At this time there was War be∣tween the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> and the States of <HI>Holland.</HI> Their Fleets had had a brush at Sea, where the brave Duke of <HI>York</HI> adventured, in person, against their Squadrons, more in number then ours. <HI>Opdam</HI> their Admiral was blown up, and after a sharp fight they fled to their own Coast, to carry thither the sad news of their defeat, and of the loss of many Ships taken by the <HI>English:</HI> When the <HI>French</HI> saw that the <HI>Hollander</HI> was likely to be worsted, he pretended an obligati∣on to defend them; therefore he declared War against us, not so much with an intention to assist the
<PB N="176" REF="90"/><HI>Hollander</HI> by Sea, as to stand by with his Fleet, and judge of the blows. However, the countenance of such a Prince, dreadful to all the World, because it was not known yet what mischeif he could do, helped them very much.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> made no attempts upon us at home, unless it be upon our industrious Merchants, who lost some Goods and Ships at Sea. But in the <HI>West Indies</HI> their treache∣ry and cruelty were remarkable in the Iland of S. <HI>Christophers,</HI> where the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Plantations had lived in Peace and Amity seve∣ral years, they supposed our <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> would endeavor to drive them away, after this breach between the two Nations. To prevent there∣fore that which the others had no design to execute, they fell upon them unawares, and massacred their Neighbors, to their eternal shame, plundering all their Goods, and
<PB N="177" REF="90"/>rifling their habitations. They sei∣sed next, the Islands of <HI>Antego, Ta∣bago,</HI> and S. <HI>Eustache.</HI> Our Men re∣solved to revenge these outrages up∣on those of <HI>Guadeloupe;</HI> but the Fleet that set forth for that intent, was dispersed by a terrible <HI>Hurri∣cane,</HI> and some of our Ships were broken and shipwracked, amongst the <HI>American</HI> Islands, to the great disappointment of the <HI>English.</HI> This War between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> continued till the year 1668. the Peace was concluded at <HI>Breda;</HI> for the <HI>French</HI> had no quarrel with the <HI>English,</HI> but only as was pretended in defence of <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P>The truth is, the King did not care to have two Enemies upon his back, at once; he was resolved to take into his possession some Towns in <HI>Flanders,</HI> belonging to the Crown of <HI>Spain;</HI> he was glad that His Majesty of <HI>England,</HI> would let him alone, and not intermeddle in this
<PB N="178" REF="91"/>Affair. The pretence to colour the invasion was, that some Articles of the Treaty of Marriage were not performed by the Court of <HI>Spain.</HI> The King, by his Ambassador at <HI>Madrid,</HI> acquainted them with his demands, but they neglected to give him satisfaction; this caused him to publish his <HI>Manifesto,</HI> to justi∣fie the seisure of those Lands and Towns which, he said, belonged to the Queen, by agreement at her Marriage.</P>
<P>At the end of <HI>May,</HI> 1667. he en∣tered into <HI>Flanders</HI> with about Thirty thousand Men, well furnish∣ed. The first Garrisons were for∣saken, as <HI>Armantiers, La Bassée, Condé,</HI> and <HI>S. Guilhain. Bergnes</HI> and <HI>Furnes,</HI> were yielded up to the Mareschal d' <HI>Aumont.</HI> The King com∣manded <HI>Charleroy</HI> to be rebuilt and fortified, that it might serve as a Bulwark against <HI>Flanders. Tournay</HI> was besieged and assaulted, but
<PB N="179" REF="91"/>could not stop the impetuous tor∣rent of the <HI>French,</HI> that carried, at this time, all before them. <HI>Douay</HI> waited for their coming, its Gover∣nor had the meen to stop the <HI>French</HI> progress: But upon his Majesties Summons, he obeyed, and sent him the Keys. <HI>Courtray</HI> was taken in four days; <HI>Oudenard</HI> and <HI>Alost</HI> were quickly frighted into a compliance with the <HI>French. Lille</HI> was the next Garrison that had the unhappiness to be in the <HI>French</HI> Kings way. The Governor of this place had the re∣putation of a brave Commander, he had under him 800 Horse and 4000 Foot in Garrison, and was resolved to defend it. Therefore the King came before it with his whole Army, laid siege to it, and, after a very stout resistance, obliged the renown∣ed▪ Governor to save the rest of his men by yielding up the Town, upon honorable terms. The King made his entry on the Eight and
<PB N="180" REF="92"/>twentieth day of <HI>August,</HI> One thou∣sand six hundred sixty and seven.</P>
<P>During the siege, the <HI>Spanish</HI> Commanders had raised a small Ar∣my, with an intent to Assault the <HI>French</HI> before <HI>Lille. Marcin</HI> was at the Head of these Troops in his march, when <HI>Crequy, Rouvray, Lille∣bonne,</HI> and <HI>Bellefonds,</HI> met with his Cavalry, in two several Rencoun∣ters, and broke his design. For these Captains had so disordered his Men, and scared them, that they could not be perswaded to attempt upon the <HI>French</HI> again without more assistance.</P>
<P>After this Campagne, the King went to <HI>Paris,</HI> and in the first ap∣pearance of the Spring, One thou∣sand six hundred sixty and eight, he gave order to his Armies to march towards the <HI>Franche Comte.</HI> The Prince had the command of this ex∣pedition; but when the Inhabitants understood it, they sent to his Ma∣jesties
<PB N="181" REF="92"/>Deputies, to treat of yielding to him, to prevent the spoils of an Army. Whilest the Deputies de∣layed, the Prince, with his Army, being ready, went streight to <HI>Besan∣zon,</HI> where he encamped. On the sixth of <HI>February,</HI> it was surrendered into his hands; some other Towns were taken without resistance, and <HI>Salines</HI> was seised upon suddenly. At that time his Majesty was come to his Army, which he caused to draw near to <HI>Dole,</HI> a place well for∣tified and furnished with Men and Cannon, which caused the Inhabi∣tants to stand upon their Guards, and think of a resistance; but when they saw that the <HI>French</HI> had pos∣sessed all the Outworks in one night, and lodged themselves under their Counterscarpe, they accepted of his Majesties offers, and sent him the Keys of their City.</P>
<P>All these places were taken in twelve days, to the great astonish∣ment
<PB N="182" REF="93"/>of all Neighboring People.</P>
<P>There had been some overtures of Peace made the year before: To pre∣vent the conclusion of them, the King appeared with his Army this year so early in the Field; for the <HI>Dutch</HI> had threatned him, by their Ambassador, to joyn with the <HI>Spa∣niard,</HI> if he would not hearken to an accommodation. This Speech, together with the Resolution of his Neighbors, of rising up in Arms against him, brought forth the Treaty of <HI>Aix la Chappelle:</HI> Unto which place, <HI>Colbert</HI> was sent as an Extraordinary Ambassador, to meet with the Ministers of the Media∣ting Princes. It was signed the sixth of <HI>May,</HI> and sent to be published at <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Brussels;</HI> but the <HI>French</HI> King was mightily offended at the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who had forced him, against his will, to this conclusion of Peace; therefore in due time he was resolved to find an occasion
<PB N="183" REF="93"/>to punish them for their sauci∣ness.</P>
<P>In the mean while, the Nobility and Gallants of <HI>France</HI> that had prepared their equipages, for the next Campagne, when they saw themselves disappointed by a hasty Peace, resolved to venture a∣broad in Foreign service. <HI>Fame</HI> had told them of the long Siege of <HI>Candy,</HI> by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and that these Infidels did daily win upon the besieged by their numbers; there∣fore the greatest Zealots of them re∣solved to hazard their persons for the releif of that noble City be∣longing to the <HI>Venetians.</HI> The Duke <HI>de Roannez,</HI> the Count of <HI>St. Paul,</HI> the Duke <HI>de Chateau-Thierry,</HI> the Chevalier <HI>de Harcour,</HI> with many other brave Adventurers, voluntari∣ly ingaged themselves in this expe∣dition. It is certain, that they be∣haved themselves with all the gal∣lantry that could be expected. At
<PB N="184" REF="94"/>their return, they acquainted the King with the condition of the place, and the strength of the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>This perswaded his Majesty, to∣gether with the Sollicitations of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> to send over thither the Dukes of <HI>Beaufort</HI> and <HI>Navailles,</HI> with about 10000 Men, to see whe∣ther they could raise the siege. All the World expected a Success an∣swerable to the <HI>French</HI> courage: At their first sallying out upon the <HI>Turks,</HI> they beat all down before them; but when the <HI>Turks</HI> saw their vigor abate, they charged furiously upon them, and routed them, for∣cing them back into the City Walls. <HI>Beaufort</HI> himself was lost, and kill∣ed, as it is supposed, in the rout, but his body could not be found afterwards.</P>
<P>He was much to be blamed for venturing his person, and the honor of his Prince, amongst the meanest
<PB N="185" REF="94"/>Soldiers; for Commanders of his rank and quality, are to be mind∣ful, that the safety of the whole Army depends upon the preserva∣tion of their lives: They are never to hazard themselves in the Front of a Battle, but when their presence is necessary, to give courage to their fainting Soldiers, or to add more vigor to them, when the victory is almost in their hands. After the de∣feat of the <HI>French,</HI> the besieged City was yielded up to the <HI>Turks</HI> General, upon very favorable con∣dition.</P>
<P>The King had intelligence about the end of the year 1669. that the Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> did endeavor to stir up the Emperor and King of <HI>Spain,</HI> against him. This caused him to send the Mareschal <HI>de Crequy</HI> with an Army of 18000 Men into <HI>Lorraine,</HI> to take in that Countrey. The Duke seised upon <HI>Pont a Mous∣son,</HI> and pulled down the Walls.
<PB N="186" REF="95"/><HI>Epinal</HI> and <HI>Chaté</HI> held out a litteè, but they were, at last, Surrendered up into his hands, and the old Duke was driven out of all his Principality.</P>
<P>This year 1670. the King visited his new conquered Towns in the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> repairèd their breaches, restored their Fortifica∣tions, and put them all into a good posture of defence. But that which was remarkable in this progress, the King had no extraordinary <HI>Militia;</HI> he trusted so much these new Sub∣jects, that he entered into all their populous Towns, attended only by his houshold Servants, and usual Guards.</P>
<P>This got him the love and respect of the <HI>Walloons,</HI> and secured him the hearts of his people, as well as the Walls of their Towns.</P>
<P>About this time, a King of <HI>Guinny,</HI> who lives at a City called <HI>Arda,</HI> sent an Ambassador to <HI>Paris</HI> to treat
<PB N="187" REF="95"/>about an establishment of a Trade, between that place, and the Islands of <HI>America,</HI> under the <HI>French</HI> Scep∣ter. The King entertained him, and his motion, very kindly, and sent him back with Tokens of his liberality.</P>
<P>There had been an Order of the Kings Council published, by which certain Wares of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were prohibited in <HI>France.</HI> They labored, by their Ambassador, to perswade the King to revoke this Order; but in vain, for the King was now resolved to revenge him∣self upon them, for their insolent carriage towards him, and his peo∣ple, in the <HI>West</HI> and <HI>East Indies,</HI> and in many Foreign Countreys; where they had ingrossed all the Trade to themselves.</P>
<P>It is certain, that both the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> had great cause to complain of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who had, on several occasions, discovered
<PB N="188" REF="96"/>an unsufferable Pride, and a haugh¦ty carriage, not to be endured by Crowned Heads. They had exer∣cised their cruelty upon the Sub∣jects of both Kingdoms beyond the Seas, and had seised upon their Goods, affronting thereby their Princes who are ingaged to protect them.</P>
<P>These, and other unjust practises, as was pretended, obliged the <HI>French</HI> to prepare for War: There∣fore in his Progress in <HI>Flanders,</HI> he visited, himself, the Fortifications of all his Frontier Towns, and caused the weakest places to be fortified with new Works; from <HI>Dunkirke,</HI> he went to <HI>Amantiers,</HI> from thence to <HI>Lille,</HI> to <HI>Courtray,</HI> to <HI>Aeth.</HI> He found that Monsieur <HI>de Montal</HI> had strongly repaired the Walls of <HI>Charle le Roy;</HI> for which, he highly commended him.</P>
<P>Before the War was proclaimed, Madam <HI>de Orleans,</HI> the only Sister a
<PB N="189" REF="96"/>live, of our Gracious Monarch, came over here unto <HI>England,</HI> to visit the King, and the Duke of <HI>York.</HI> She was received with all the ex∣pressions of kindness, that <HI>Nature</HI> did require, and her Vertues de∣serve. But as all our satisfactions are momentary, she had no sooner seen these dear Relations, but was forced to leave them again, and re∣turn over to <HI>France,</HI> where she died so suddenly, that most men en∣tertained the bad reports that were raised about her death. However, the Court of <HI>France</HI> honored her Birth and Vertues, with an out∣ward Mourning, and the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI>'s countenance seemed to be very sad and pensive, until the King had cheared him up with the thoughts of another Wife. The Daughter of the Prince <HI>Palatine</HI> of the <HI>Rhine</HI> was pitched upon; the Mareschal <HI>du Plessis</HI> was sent to es∣pouse her in the Dukes name, in the
<PB N="190" REF="97"/>City of <HI>Mets,</HI> the sixteenth day of <HI>November.</HI> The Duke himself wen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as far as <HI>Chalons,</HI> to receive and welcome her: The King, the Queen, and all the Court expressed their joy and satisfaction for her safe arrival; and about a year after, she was brought to Bed of a Son.</P>
<P>All this while, the War was pre∣paring against <HI>Holland. England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> were to unite their For∣ces, by Sea and Land. On the se∣venth day of <HI>April,</HI> 1672. the King published his Declaration, to forbid all Commerce and Trade with the States of the <HI>Ʋnited Provinces;</HI> and immediately after, appeared at the Head of an Army of One hundred and fifty thousand Men, with whom he carried all before him in the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> as a violent torrent: No∣thing was of a sufficient resistance for so great a power; every one did judge, that he would win all the other Towns, the following Spring,
<PB N="191" REF="97"/>if there were not a stop put to his undertakings. But the motion of the <HI>French</HI> is always violent at the first, and then at the least discourage∣ment, it begins to abate. The Dutchy of <HI>Cleves,</HI> the Electorate of <HI>Cullen,</HI> the Dutchy of <HI>Limburgh,</HI> the County of <HI>Zutphen, Ʋtrecht,</HI> and its Territories. <HI>Holland, Bra∣bant, Overissell,</HI> the <HI>Oriental Frieze, Groningen,</HI> and the Dutchy of <HI>Gel∣dres,</HI> were full of <HI>French</HI> Troops, on a sudden. <HI>Orsoy, Vesel, Burick,</HI> and <HI>Rhineburgh,</HI> that had been so strongly Garrisoned, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> thought them to be the Bulwarks of their Land, were surrendered at the first appearance of the Kings Standard. <HI>Reez, Emmerick,</HI> and <HI>Groll,</HI> were delivered to the Bishop of <HI>Munster,</HI> who had taken up Arms to vindicate the <HI>French</HI> quar∣rel.</P>
<P>The next attempt was, the Pass∣age over the <HI>Rhine,</HI> which was first
<PB N="192" REF="98"/>undertaken by the Count <HI>de Guiche,</HI> at the Head of Two thousand Horse, he swom over it, although three Squadrons of Horse, and some few Foot, were ready to re∣ceive him on the other side. When the <HI>French</HI> had recovered the Bank, they charged so desperately, that the Enemy was disordered, and fled to their Foot for succor. They had Barricadoed themselves in, but when the Prince, and the Dukes of <HI>Orleans</HI> and <HI>Longueville,</HI> were got on the other side with their Infan∣try, they resolved to assault them in their Trenches. The Prince de∣sired to march in order against them, but some of his Men were so furious, that nothing could keep them in. The Duke of <HI>Longueville,</HI> in a rage, went so near them, with the Prince, that the Duke was kill∣ed, and the Prince wounded in the left arm, with many more laid up∣on the ground.</P>
<PB N="193" REF="98"/>
<P>When they saw the whole Army surround them, they desired quar∣ter, which was granted by the Prince, by that means they yielded, and were all taken prisoners. It is not good to render an Enemy de∣sperate, a small company in a dan∣ger have won the victory; there∣fore the Prince freely offered them their lives.</P>
<P>This Action amazed the <HI>Hol∣lander,</HI> and astonished the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who expected the Kings Army another way. <HI>Harnen</HI> was taken by Monsieur <HI>de Turenne, Ni∣meguen</HI> and <HI>Schenk</HI> also. <HI>Does∣bourgh</HI> and <HI>Zutphen,</HI> were surren∣de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed into his Majesties hands, and the City of <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> sent Deputies to yield it up. Monsieur <HI>de Lux∣emburgh</HI> was sent thither to take in all the places about <HI>Ʋtrecht.</HI> After this, <HI>Turenne</HI> recovered <HI>Crevecoeur, Coërden, Grave,</HI> and <HI>Bomel;</HI> so that almost all the Inland Countrey
<PB N="194" REF="99"/>thereabouts, submitted to the <HI>French.</HI> The <HI>Hollanders</HI> were then so much troubled, that they offered Conditions of Peace to the King; but he hoped to gain all the rest of their Countrey: Therefore they were rejected as unreasonable.</P>
<P>The King after all these Successes, left the Army the Six and twentieth of <HI>July,</HI> and arrived at <HI>Paris</HI> the first of <HI>August,</HI> where he was con∣gratulated and welcomed by all the Societies of his Kingdom. The Queen was so much overjoyed, that she commanded a Chappel to be built at <HI>Roan,</HI> and dedicated it to <HI>Our Lady of Victories;</HI> for as a∣mongst the Heathens they did give to <HI>Pallas,</HI> the Goddess of War, se∣veral attributes, and names be∣tokening the many good Office that they fancied, proceeded fron<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her favoring of them: So the Pa¦pists assign divers, and differing ti∣tles to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> who is
<PB N="195" REF="99"/>now become the Goddess of War amongst them, and the Giver of Victory to her devout Proselites.</P>
<P>The Princes wound had cast him into an indisposition, which made him follow his Majesty, and accom∣pany the Duke of <HI>Orleans,</HI> the Kings Brother, to <HI>Paris,</HI> leaving the Conduct of Affairs to Monsieur <HI>de Luxembourgh</HI> and <HI>Turenne.</HI> The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was then before <HI>Voërden</HI> with Twelve thousand Men; <HI>Luxembourgh</HI> prepares a strong brigade of Two thousand five hun∣dred Men, and by a secret way over the Marshes, he gets into the Town undiscovered, with his Party, with which he made such stout Sallies, that the Prince was forced to rise from thence with his Army, to leave some of his Baggage and Cannon be∣hind him.</P>
<P>All this while the <HI>Dutch</HI> had scarce time to look about, the <HI>French</HI> had been so nimble and
<PB N="196" REF="100"/>furious, that they had gained all this Countrey, without any consi∣derable loss. But before the next Campagne, the face of affairs was changed, the <HI>Dutch</HI> had many Armies come to their assistance, the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> the <HI>German,</HI> and the <HI>Im∣perialists,</HI> sent their powerful Suc∣cors to aid them: So that they have since recovered a great part of what they first lost, and will, accord∣ing to all probability, recover the rest.</P>
<P>The Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> was now restored by Order of the States, after the inhumane massacre of <HI>de Wit,</HI> to his Patrimonial Offices of <HI>Statholder, Admiral,</HI> and <HI>General of the Ʋnited-Provinces.</HI> This generous Prince began to appear at the Head of an Army of 24000 Men; with these he resolved not to be idle; some places he took, but did not yet dare to adventure against his inso∣lent Enemy, triumphing for so many
<PB N="197" REF="100"/>great Successes. <HI>Monterey,</HI> Viceroy of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> for the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> desired him to attempt some∣thing in his Countrey, because the <HI>French</HI> had drained their Garrisons; for the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had not declared yet against them. According to this advice, he laid siege to <HI>Charle∣roy,</HI> a Fortress that was likely to annoy the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> their next Neighbors. <HI>Montal,</HI> the Governor, had notice of the design, he Posts: thither in haste; and taking his: time in the night, he passed through the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Troops, and got safe into the Garrison, to the great joy of the besieged. The next day he adventured to sally out with a strong party, which was re∣ceived and welcomed by the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> with loss on both sides. When the King heard of this siege, he drew near to the Borders of <HI>Pi∣cardy,</HI> and gave order to several thousands of his Soldiers to meet
<PB N="198" REF="101"/>him, with a design to beat the <HI>Dutch</HI> off. Therefore this intelligence caused the Prince to rise with his Army, the Two and twentieth day of <HI>December,</HI> and depart: Which was signified to the King by a Post, sent from the Governor.</P>
<P>At this time, <HI>Luxembourgh</HI> at∣tempted to lead his Men over the Ice, to Assault <HI>Bodengrave, Swam∣merdam,</HI> and <HI>Niverburgh;</HI> which three places he took without much resistance. After this, the <HI>French</HI> went no further till the next Spring, 1673. They were all sent into seve∣ral Garrisons, where we shall leave them to take notice of their behavi∣or at Sea.</P>
<P>On the Water, as well as on the Land, the War was carried on. The <HI>Dutch</HI> had a gallant Fleet, with which they did defie the Fleets of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France:</HI> But though <HI>De Ruyter,</HI> their Admiral, labored by Policy to fight us, and to sur∣prise
<PB N="199" REF="101"/>us at an advantage; he was much mistaken to find our <HI>English</HI> courage, in the greatest discourage∣ment, not to resist and brave Death it self.</P>
<P>His Majesty of <HI>England</HI> had been engaged to joyn his strong Fleet with the <HI>French</HI> Squadron, which was commanded by the Count <HI>de Estrées.</HI> Therefore the Twenty eighth of <HI>May,</HI> 1672. in prosecu∣tion of the War that had been de∣clared against the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> our Fleet, under the command of the brave Duke of <HI>York,</HI> had a very sharp Engagement with the <HI>Dutch,</HI> upon the <HI>English</HI> Coast; in which, the Victory declared for the <HI>English,</HI> with the loss of the <HI>Royal James,</HI> which was unfortunately burned; and of the Earl of <HI>Sand∣wich,</HI> who was drowned, and his body found about the tenth of the next Moneth floating on the <HI>English</HI> shore. He was an excellent Captain,
<PB N="200" REF="102"/>more fortunate in the <HI>Mediterrane∣an,</HI> and in the <HI>Sound,</HI> then in our Channel. <HI>England</HI> lamented the loss of so excellent a person. It seems his courage destroyed him; for when his Ship was Boarded and Fired by a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> when it was surrounded by many of the Ene∣mies best Ships; His resolution to brave Death, and the Enemy, in the midst of the greatest disadvantages and dangers, made him abide and continue the sight in his Flaming Ship.</P>
<P>Of our <HI>English,</HI> Twenty four Persons of Note were killed, with three of the <HI>French.</HI> Amongst the rest, a Gentleman, so Courageous, Learned, Civil, and so well accom∣plished, that I cannot but mention him in this place: It was Mr. <HI>Cle∣ment Cotterel,</HI> Sir <HI>Charles Cotterels</HI> Son. About fifteen Gentlemen were desperately wounded, seven hun∣dred Common Soldiers and Seamen
<PB N="201" REF="102"/>killed, and as many maimed. Mon∣sieur <HI>de Rabiniere tres le Bois,</HI> Rear Admiral of the <HI>French,</HI> was killed, and buried at <HI>Rochel.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>York,</HI> in this En∣gagement, behaved himself as a discreet and wise Commander, with an undaunted Courage.</P>
<P>It is supposed, that if our whole Fleet could have had the conveni∣ency of fighting, the <HI>Dutch</HI> had been for ever undone; but the Wind hindered most part of our Ships from coming up to them; so that the Blew Squadron was forced to ingage with the Enemy alone. The <HI>Dutch</HI> had great loss of Men and Ships; it is thought about five or six of theirs, besides the Fire∣ships were sunk: It is certain, that our Fleet pursued them to their own Coast.</P>
<P>About this time, the Twentieth of <HI>August,</HI> 1672. hapned a most barbarous execution of the two
<PB N="202" REF="103"/><HI>De Wits</HI> torn in pieces by the rude rabble of the <HI>Hague,</HI> their Privities cut off, their Bodies dragged through the Streets, and hanged at the Gallows, in such a barbarous manner, that the <HI>Cannibals</HI> would have been ashamed to have done the like.</P>
<P><HI>Groningen</HI> had been besieged by the Mercenary Weather-cock of <HI>Munster;</HI> but in the Moneth of <HI>August</HI> he left the Town, after a con∣siderable loss of his Men. The good Bishop was moved with compassion to see his Soldiers slaughtered by the stout-hearted <HI>Dutch;</HI> so that he preferred their safety, or it may be his own, to the filling of his Purse with Gilders; which was the thing this noble Captain aimed at in this attempt upon the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>The States of <HI>Holland</HI> had pre∣vailed with many of their Neigh∣bors, especially with the Emperor, King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Bran∣denburgh,</HI>
<PB N="203" REF="103"/>to send their Succors to assist them by Land. The Prince <HI>Palatine</HI> was perswaded, notwith∣standing his Alliance with <HI>France,</HI> to enter into the party. They were all resolved to send into the Field their Armies, in the next Spring; for they were afraid that the <HI>French</HI> would not be content with the Conquest of <HI>Holland,</HI> but would incroach upon them also after∣wards.</P>
<P>During this Winter, nothing hap∣ned worthy of notice, but the loss of private persons, robberies, and small Encounters of Parties, that sought for Plunder and Booties.</P>
<P>In the beginning of the Spring, 1673. three Armies appeared for the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> the King of <HI>Spains</HI> commanded by the Count <HI>de Mon∣terey,</HI> the Emperors by <HI>Montecuculi,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Brandenburghs</HI> by him∣self; besides the Army of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> who was declared Ge∣neral
<PB N="204" REF="104"/>at Land, Admiral at Sea, and Statholder by the States. The <HI>French</HI> Army commanded by <HI>Turenne,</HI> marched against the Duke of <HI>Bran∣denburgh,</HI> who was forced to quit to him all the County of <HI>Marck,</HI> and to leave his Bag and Baggage behind him, for fear of a total de∣feat of his Forces. The <HI>French</HI> took <HI>Ʋrnia, Ham, Camen, Altenau, Soest,</HI> and <HI>Hoexter, Bilefeld,</HI> and <HI>Ravensperg,</HI> small places of no strength.</P>
<P>At this time, the <HI>Swede</HI> and the <HI>Dane,</HI> with other Neuter Princes, had desired an accommodation of the differences between the Kings of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France. Cologne</HI> was the place of meeting; all the Ple∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipotentiaries were sent with In∣structions: But although the <HI>Dutch</HI> had so many losses by Land, and by Sea, they would not yield to any reasonable Propositions at first. Their stout hearts were resolved to
<PB N="205" REF="104"/>try the Fortune of War, before they would listen to any peaceable conclusion. At last after several De∣bates, and Consultations, the Peace was concluded between the King of <HI>England</HI> and the States, but the <HI>French</HI> pretentions were extraordi∣nary high, and their Successes great; so that there was no possibility that did appear, to end their differences at this time. But before the Peace was published between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> all this Summer of the year 1673. the War was vigorously carried on by Sea and Land.</P>
<P>By Sea, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> command∣ed a Fleet of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> One hundred and twenty Sail. With these Ships he attacked the <HI>Dutch</HI> Frigats, under the command of <HI>De Ruyter</HI> and <HI>Van Trump.</HI> The fight was mannaged with much re∣solution on both sides: The <HI>French</HI> in the former Engagements had been taught to face their Enemy
<PB N="206" REF="105"/>upon the Water; for they behaved themselves now very bravely, be∣cause they could not well excuse themselves. It is certain, the Princes conduct and courage in this, and all other Engagements, have justly de∣served the praise of all Men, and the thanks of our Nation. This noble Spirit hath since his infancy, spent his Wit and Blood in the de∣fence, and for the honor of our Countrey.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> proclaimed Victory at Land, whilest their Ships and Shipwracks complained of their ill usage at Sea by the <HI>English.</HI> They lost eight considerable Vessels, that of <HI>Van Haen</HI> was the chief, it was blown up by an unfortunate shot. Many were so disabled, that they could not reach into their Harbors. His Majesties Fleet had received some damage in the Rigging, and loss of Men; but not so as to hinder them the next morning, the nineth
<PB N="207" REF="105"/>of <HI>May,</HI> from pursuing their Ene∣mies to their own Coast. The <HI>Dutch</HI> lost many Men, some of note, and a Ship taken by the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>At Land there were frequent en∣counters between the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French.</HI> The City of <HI>Mastreicht</HI> was the cheif place of action this Summer: The Count <HI>de Lorge,</HI> and Monsieur <HI>Montall,</HI> were ordered to invest it, the sixth of <HI>June:</HI> The rest of the Army marched thither to post themselves about this strong place. <HI>Fario</HI> was then Governor, with a very stout Garrison of six thousand Men; the Count <HI>de Mon∣terey</HI> had sent thither two thousand <HI>Italian</HI> Horse and Foot, to reinforce the place. The King himself was in the Army with the bravest and choicest Regiments; and the Noble Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> with several thousand <HI>English</HI> under his com∣mand.</P>
<PB N="208" REF="106"/>
<P>It is certain, the <HI>French</HI> King visit∣ed the Trenches, and incouraged his Troops, with a great contempt of the danger. <HI>Fario</HI> had sent him this civil message, That if he knew whereabouts his Majesties Quarters were, he would command his Men to forbear shooting to that place: The King sent him word again, That his Quarters were every where in his Camp. The besieged made a stout resistance, many Men were kil∣led on both sides. It is thought that this Town might have put a stop to the <HI>French</HI> Conquests, if the Burgers had been more faithful to their old Masters, and less careless of their lives and riches. It is cer∣tain, that it had never been taken by the <HI>French</HI> alone, had not our <HI>English</HI> spent their blood, and in contempt of all danger, passed with their Regiments through showers of small and great shot, to the Assault.</P>
<PB N="209" REF="106"/>
<P>We cannot sufficiently admire the courage of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> a young General of an admirable conduct and skill in Martial Affairs. He commanded in the Trenches, with an intention to assault the Counterscarpe, and the Half-Moon, before <HI>Brussels-Gate.</HI> He led on his Men with such resolution, that though two or three Mines were sprung up, and the shot fell thick amongst them, they carried the Half-Moon, to the great wonder of all men, in half an hour.</P>
<P>As soon as it was taken, the Duke, with his Party, was immediately re∣lieved by the <HI>French,</HI> upon whom, the besieged played so briskly, with their great and small shot, that they beat them out with the assistance of a Mine, and a stout Sally. When the Duke saw that the <HI>French</HI> had lost what his Men had got, he pre∣pared himself to regain it; which he did with the greatest resolution
<PB N="210" REF="107"/>and happiness imaginable. This in∣vincible spirit at the Head of his Party, leaped over the Trenches first, with his Weapon in his hand, only twelve stout Voluntiers accom∣panied him, the rest followed so furiously, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> were beat∣en off again, and his Grace became Master of the Half-Moon the se∣cond time, delivering it into the hands of Monsieur <HI>de la Feuillade.</HI> So that without flattery, the <HI>French</HI> ow the taking of <HI>Mastreicht</HI> to the courage, conduct, and brave resolu∣tion of the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> to the Blood and undauntedness of our <HI>English.</HI> Sir <HI>Henry Jones</HI> was killed in one of these assaults, which hapned the twenty fourth of <HI>June.</HI> After some other attempts, where our Men were again imployed, the Town desired a Parley the twenty nineth, and in two hours the Arti∣cles were granted, That the Go∣vernor and Garrison should march
<PB N="211" REF="107"/>out as stout Soldiers, their Colours flying, Drums beating, Match light∣ed, Bullet in Mouth, with Bag and Baggage, and two Pieces of Can∣non, and a Mortar Piece. That they should be safely convoyed to <HI>Boisle∣due</HI> and <HI>Breda.</HI> The <HI>French</HI> lost 4000 Men, and about 1000 of the besieged were killed. The King took possession of it the thirtieth of <HI>June,</HI> and commanded the Cardinal <HI>de Boüillon</HI> to resanctifie the Church∣es profaned by the <HI>Dutches</HI> Devo∣tions.</P>
<P>About this time there hapned an∣other Sea-sight, between the <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleets, with loss on both sides; but our <HI>English</HI> beat the boasting <HI>Dutch</HI> again into their Harbors, where they left them to complain of their wounds and dead, and to glory in their pretended Suc∣cesses and Victories.</P>
<P>The many Armies that were now on foot, to attend upon and stop
<PB N="212" REF="108"/>the further proceedings of the <HI>French,</HI> caused them to call away their Garrisons from many Conquer∣ed Towns: Besides the Sickness and the War, had consumed a great number; so that they were forced, for their own safety, to gather a little more close together. Several strong places were abandoned, and several were dismantled; the So∣diers were sent to reinforce the Armies.</P>
<P>During this Winter, many En∣counters hapned between the Ene∣mies, and some few unconsiderable places taken. But now to the great joy of <HI>England,</HI> it pleased His Ma∣jesty to grant a Peace to the <HI>Hol∣lander,</HI> on most honorable Condi∣tions to the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> King nevertheless continues his designs by Land; but by Sea he commands his Ships to be drawn up, or to sail out of the Dutchmens sight. In the beginning
<PB N="213" REF="108"/>of the Spring he besieged <HI>Besanzon,</HI> in the <HI>Franche Comté; Pesme, Mar∣nay,</HI> were taken before by the Duke of <HI>Navailles,</HI> the fourteenth of <HI>February.</HI> The strong Town of <HI>Gray</HI> was yielded up after two or three days siege: On the twenty eighth, <HI>Vesoal</HI> was also taken. The King himself, with a strong Party, arrived at his Camp before <HI>Besanzon,</HI> in the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> 1674. It was surrendered into his Majesties hands before the end of the Moneth, after many brave exploits and much blood shed.</P>
<P>Whiles the Treaty was on foot at <HI>Cologne,</HI> the Emperor caused the Prince of <HI>Furstemberg,</HI> Plenipoten∣tiary for the Archbishop of <HI>Cologne,</HI> to be arrested by the Officers of his Regiment of <HI>Grana,</HI> in his Coach, and carried to <HI>Bon,</HI> because he had not maintained the interest of the Empire, as he should have done, he being a Subject.</P>
<PB N="214" REF="109"/>
<P>This violent proceeding did mightily scandalise all the Ambas∣sadors, especially the Archbishop, and the <HI>French</HI> King, were offended at this violence: For they pretend, that the person of an Ambassador is sacred, and not to be violated by any means. <HI>Nature</HI> hath taught the most barbarous people to suffer them to go and come in safety, who are imployed in quenching the Flames of War.</P>
<P><HI>Navaigne</HI> was afterwards be∣sieged and yielded to the Prince of <HI>Condé;</HI> but the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> had an intent to succor it, had not the besieged made so much haste to secure their lives by a Surrender. <HI>Dole</HI> was also besieged by the King, and taken after a stout resistance.</P>
<P>The fifteenth of <HI>June,</HI> there hap∣ned a fight between Monsieur <HI>de Turenne,</HI> and the Imperialists com∣manded by the Duke of <HI>Lorraine,</HI> and the Count of <HI>Caprara.</HI> The
<PB N="215" REF="109"/>Duke of <HI>Bournonville</HI> was march∣ing up to them, <HI>Turenne</HI> resolved to hinder a conjunction; for that pur∣pose, he passed the <HI>Rhine</HI> at <HI>Philips∣burgh.</HI> The Duke and Count had but Seven thousand Horse, and a Regiment of Foot, but <HI>Turenne</HI> was Twelve thousand strong. The Confederates behaved themselves so bravely, that had they not been inferior in number, they had forced the <HI>French</HI> to a retreat. After a hot ingagement, which lasted all the Afternoon, the <HI>Germans</HI> sought their fafety in a retreat over the <HI>Neckar;</HI> many brave Men were kill∣ed on both sides, some say the loss was equal. It is certain, four thou∣sand Men lay dead on the Ground; the old Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> headed his Troops with so much resolution, as if he had intended to win a Duke∣dom in another World, by his not∣able courage.</P>
<PB N="216" REF="110"/>
<P>The <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, about one hun∣dred Sail, passed out of the Chan∣nel to scoure the Seas, of all <HI>French</HI> Frigats, and to attempt something upon the Coast; they Landed on <HI>Belle Isle,</HI> but were repulsed after the loss of a few Men.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Schomberg</HI> com∣manded the <HI>French</HI> Forces in <HI>Cata∣lonia;</HI> in the County of <HI>Rousillon,</HI> he ingaged with them, and forced them to a retreat, with the loss of his Son, and another Gentleman of quality taken prisoners.</P>
<P>The next action was between the Prince of <HI>Condé,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> assisted by the Count <HI>de Souches,</HI> the eleventh of <HI>August,</HI> near <HI>Haynault.</HI> The two Armies were resolved to have a brush, which was performed with much gallantry: The Prince of <HI>Oranges</HI> Army lost many Men, and Commanders; and the <HI>French</HI> disputed the case very stoutly; at last they retreated into
<PB N="217" REF="110"/>their Camp, carrying with them many noble prisoners, and most part of the Princes Baggage; leav∣ing the <HI>Dutch</HI> to boast of their empty and sorrowful Victory, in the open Field.</P>
<P>At this time <HI>Grave</HI> was besieged by the <HI>Dutch:</HI> The <HI>French</HI> could not be perswaded to surrender it, till after a long and bloody siege.</P>
<P>The <HI>Messinenses</HI> had revolted from the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and put them∣selves under the <HI>French</HI> protection. The Duke <HI>de Vivonne</HI> arrived there, with some Succors, and relief of Men, and Provision. The Inhabi∣tants put them in possession of the strongest places about the City; the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by Sea and Land, endeavored to plague them. A short conflict hapned upon the Coast, between the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleets, where the noise of their great Guns, and their mutual Rodomontadoes, soon terrified
<PB N="218" REF="111"/>them, and made them both willing to part upon equal terms. By this means the <HI>Messinenses</HI> had some Pro∣vision brought to them in their ur∣gent necessity.</P>
<P>In <HI>October,</HI> the Confederates, in∣camped upon the skirts of <HI>Turennes</HI> Army, were forced to fight near <HI>Strasburgh;</HI> they lost three thousand Men, ten Pieces of Cannon, thirty Standards, and many Prisoners; the <HI>French</HI> also had many of their best Menkilled. The Confederates re∣treated to <HI>Spire,</HI> and <HI>Turenne</HI> to the sides of the <HI>Rhine.</HI></P>
<P>The taking of the Cittadel of <HI>Leige</HI> this Winter, by the <HI>French,</HI> was an accident, that surprised and startled all the World. It was be∣trayed by a treacherous Governor, and delivered into the Kings hands, who sent thither three thousand Men to remain in Garrison.</P>
<P>This year 1675 the War con∣tinues still call <HI>Europe</HI> is ingaged in
<PB N="219" REF="111"/>this Bloody dispute, between the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Dutch.</HI> The <HI>Swedes</HI> have been perswaded, for the <HI>French</HI> sake to enter into the Borders of the Duke of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> and in defence of the Protestant Interest, as they pretend, to help the <HI>French,</HI> who carries on the Popes. There∣fore they have quartered their Army all this Winter, upon the Sub∣jects of <HI>Brandenburgh,</HI> who hath been forced to draw his Army from the Confederates to stop the <HI>Swedes</HI> violences.</P>
<P>In <HI>May</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King caused <HI>Limburgh</HI> to be besieged, after the taking of <HI>Huy</HI> and <HI>Dinant.</HI> The Confederates were resolved to raise the siege, but the surrender pre∣vented them. Nevertheless the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> have behaved them∣selves very stoutly in the defence of this Town.</P>
<P>At present the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> with his Army, attends upon the
<PB N="220" REF="112"/><HI>French</HI> King near <HI>Ruremond; Tu∣renne</HI> is incamped near the <HI>Rhine,</HI> about <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> in sight of the <HI>German,</HI> commanded by <HI>Montecu∣culi.</HI> All the World expects to hear of a bloody dispute between them. What end this great quarrel will have, God alone knows; however we ought to lament at the miseries of our Neighbors, at the Christian Blood that is shed to satisfie the Am∣bition of a Prince that wants no∣thing on Earth, but Content. We ought to pray God to preserve our <HI>England,</HI> in Peace and Unity; and our gracious King, the best of all Monarchs, in health and prosperity.</P>
<CLOSER>Amen.</CLOSER>
