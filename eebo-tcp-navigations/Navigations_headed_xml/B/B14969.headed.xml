<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Breslaw the 30. of Iuly 1621.</HEAD>
<P>In Silesta the Emperours affaires stand but vpon bad termes, by reason that the rude and bloody Execution at Prague, had brought the Countrey into a new distrust and desperation, and therefore they held secret correspon∣dence with the King <HI>Frederick</HI> and Count <HI>Mansfield.</HI></P>

<P>In the interim was examined at Lynts the Lord <HI>Dep∣tarenburgh,</HI> late Colonell of the said Country, and after∣wards was led prisoner vnto the Castle, the chiefe Prea∣cher of the said Countrey, and all his goods were seized on, without declaring the cause, and then being arriued all the Imperiall Friers, and it being told them that the Emperour had discharged them of their Oathes, and that thereupon they should take a new Oath to the Duke of Bauaria, that the States of the Countrey should come thither the <HI>14.</HI> of that instant.</P>

<P>At Prague they had of late set at liberty the rest of the prisoners being Counsellors and Burgesses, except some which were yet to continue prisoners, for that the Em∣periall Commissaries hauing dispatched their Commis∣sion there, were to goe to Mora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ia, for to performe the like execution vpon the Lords that were prisoners there.</P>
<P>Those of Tabor as yet hold out, expecting daily ayde, because all passages are shut vp against them: the Mar∣quis of Iagendorpe as yet hauing in all hast raised more forces, and hauing brought them vnder new Ensignes and Coronets, and caused them to take their Oath to the King <HI>Frederick,</HI> his people are retired againe from Risen∣burgh to Glats, the meane while the yong Count <HI>Thorn</HI> is entred into the Dukedome of Teschen and Troppen, with <HI>4000.</HI> Souldiers, and is Master of the chiefest pas∣sages there, the Princes and States of Silesia, there le∣uying new Forces there for the defence of their Coun∣trey, and to send to the frontiers of Poland.</P>

<P>Some fewe dayes past, there came to Collen a holy Italian Frier of the Woldoenders order of the Corme∣lites, whom the common people iudgeth to be a Prophet, because that hée had fore-told the victory of the Emperor against the King of Bohemia, and obtained it by his for∣uent prayers. He is here receiued with so great deusti∣on, that it is almost vnpossible to relate it, because that thorough the great presse of people, hée could not get with his Horse-litter through the stréetes of the Citie, where∣vpon some rubbed their Beads to his garments, others cut some small péeces at his holy Cowle, and he that might kisse his hand, estéemed himselfe most happy. In summa, all those that were creeple, deafe, blinde, dumbe, and dis∣eased, came running to him, who in time may yet be cured. Our Elector, hauing knowledge of his arriuall, came suddainly to him, who with great intreatings got the staffe of the holy man.</P>
