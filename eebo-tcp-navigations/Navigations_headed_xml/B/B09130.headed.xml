<HEAD>An EXACT and TRUE ACCOUNT Of the taking Five FRENCH SHIPS Laden with AMMUNITION, By the <HI>Dutch,</HI> design'd for <HI>Ireland:</HI> Together with the particulars of the Blowing up of <HI>DƲNKIRK</HI> by the Magazine taking Fire.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>French</HI> Letters say, and the <HI>Dutch</HI> Letters confirm, that Five <HI>French</HI> Ships laden in the Port of <HI>Dunkirk</HI> with all sorts of Mu∣nitions of War, and going under the Convoy of two of their small Fri∣gats design'd for <HI>Ireland,</HI> were intercepted and taken by three <HI>Dutch</HI> Men of Wat; the <HI>French</HI> Convoys, after receiving the first Broad∣side, sheeting off, escaped; and they are now actually brought into <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> where being examined into, are found to be Freighted with these following Parti∣culars, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>In one of them are 16 Demi-Culverins upon Carriages, with Sponges. Ladies and all other Materials thereto, as Traces, and Harness for the Draught of Horses 236 Barrels of Gunpowder. 6000 Iron Bullets. 120 Quintals of Match. 500 Barrels of Musquet. Carbine, and Pistol-shot. 1500 Chevaux de Frize. 400 Tunespiks. 8 Gabions, and other Baskets. 7000 Mattocks, as many Shovels. 300 Wheel Barrows. 2 Mortars 600 Bombs, from 60 to 100 <HI>l.</HI> weight each. 6000 Horse-shoes. 2000 Saddles, as many Bridles, with Holsters for Pistols, and Cruppers. 4000 New Tents. 3000 Firelock Musquets. 2000 Matchlocks. 1000 Fusees 6000 Swords, Bandaliers, Belts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with much other Materials, too long to insert, all which are condemned as Prize, and are to be brought to <HI>Amster∣dam,</HI> and the greatest part order'd to <HI>Maestricht</HI> and <HI>Breda</HI> for the use of the States Army. And this direful Misfortune (as the <HI>English</HI> Proverb denotes, <HI>seldom Comes Alone</HI>) is ushered in with another worse than that before mention'd; where∣of take the Particulars.</P>
<P>At <HI>Dunkirk</HI> there happen'd a Terrible and Surprizing Disaster in the <HI>French</HI> Gar∣rison there: For the same being look'd upon the Metropolitan over all the <HI>French</HI> Garrisons in the New Conquests in <HI>Flanders,</HI> whereby mighty Stores of all sorts of Munitions of War were Reposited, for the carrying on the Designs of <HI>Leuis</HI> the XIV, was by one Fatal Blow and Disaster, through the Negligence of a Drunken Workman, or Soldier, with a lighted Pipe of Tobacco, entirely Blown up and De∣stroyed.</P>
<P>The certainty of the Occasion cannot be authentickly known, because the Powder gave no minutes for Enquiry, but precipitatly carried all before it into the Region of the Air, which as it was more Inclusive, had greater Extensive Essicacy on the Garrison, it having destroyed and wholly mined one Third of the Interiour Fortifi∣cations,
<PB REF="2"/>and made a large Breach in the Wall of the Side towards the Sea, there be∣ing computed 2000 Barrels of Powder to be lost, which is an extreme Injury to <HI>France,</HI> the same being valued at eight Pounds ten Shillings <HI>Sterling</HI> each Barrel, besides the Store of Arms and Ammunition adjoining, are either broke to pieces, or burned in the Ruines, there not being one part of the said Garrison, but what re∣ceived its dreadful Effects, either by the destruction of the House, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> some People therein, the tops of all the Buildings, being either carried away, or broke down afterwards with the Stoues, or other ponderous weight which fell thereon. And the Damage is almost Irreparable, one hundred thousand Pounds <HI>Sterling</HI> being not sufficient to put it into its pristine Condition, for the terrible Shock which it made, has created a great many Cracks and dismal Casma's in the very Wall of the Fortifications, which must be wholly taken down to the ground to be repaired, otherwise Untenable; and upon a strict Examination, about 530 people, as well Soldiers as Inhabitants, have perished in this <HI>Catastrophe,</HI> among them 43 Officers, and above 300 others are miserably shatter'd or wounded with the Stones: And there are some which conclude that it was occasioned by the Treachery of seve∣tie new Convert Soldiers, but considering that the person which perpetrated it, was a Companion in the misery which ensued; we believe that it was more Misfortune than Design; and the rather, for that it was known, that a considerable Quantity of Powder brought from Foreign parts, had, by the Saline and Vaporous Quality of the Sea received some Detriment, whereby it was drying, and making again ser∣viceable. However it was (as all Advantages with Enemies are best) it betokens a lucky progress of Assairs to all the Confederates in the ensuing Campagnes espe∣cially in the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to which place the said Powder was principally design'd, and where we do not doubt the <HI>French</HI> Rhodomantado's as soon as ap∣pear, will vanish in Smoke.</P>
