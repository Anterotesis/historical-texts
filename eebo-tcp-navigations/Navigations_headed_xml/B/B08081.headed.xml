<HEAD>A POETICALL SEA-PEICE:</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>SO spake the stormy fiend; whose work it was,</L>
<L>To vex the aer, and seas as smoothe as glasse,</L>
<L>To roll on heaps till they on end doe stand,</L>
<L>Where they against the windes doe breaking band,</L>
<L>And lift at heaven, and in their rangeing race,</L>
<L>Twixt ridg and ridg the deep engulphing space,</L>
<L>Appeares like jawes infernall, mouthes of hell,</L>
<L>To swallow whole Fleets whole, none left to tell,</L>
<L>The losses hapning in those liquid graves.</L>
<L>Thus while the windes doe tyrannise the waves,</L>
<L>Great clapps of thunder break from thickned skie,</L>
<L>And shafts of lightning through the region flie,</L>
<L>And flie at randon, which more terrour breed:</L>
<L>They onely happy who were strucken dead.</L>
<L>The wilde seas madded thus, in their affray,</L>
<L>Doe threaten with their dash to put out day.</L>
<L>The rocks in sight would faine have shrunck the head,</L>
<L>The hidden to be seene in vaine doe dread.</L>
<L>The battred shores had almost yeelded back,</L>
<L>The waves so litle of their wils did lack:</L>
<L>And but for bounds the worlds creatour fixt,</L>
<L>All th' elements had once again been mixt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Mariner, when first the storm began,</L>
<L>By known signes taught to feare, looks pale and wan,</L>
<L>His sailes takes in, and stoups unto that ill,</L>
<L>He cannot master, and with sighes doth fill,</L>
<L>The deafe, and angry heavens, from whose offense,</L>
<L>The persecution came, permitted thence.</L>
<L>For otherwise an host of spirits want powr,</L>
<L>To stirre a breath, or strain a slender showr.</L>
<L>The sprinkling of the breaking waves beget,</L>
<L>Somewhat like rain, and which as much doth wet.</L>
<L>Yet fell rain also in so vast a store,</L>
<L>As had the windes slept, and the waves no more,</L>
<L>Been stirring then the windes, and force did use,</L>
<L>Which might, the ship it sunck not, bulge, and bruise:</L>
<L>Like chorus between acts so came the rain,</L>
<L>Peal after peal, then tragick storms again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Away goes steerage, and the lead away,</L>
<L>All courses fail, no road is near, nor bay.</L>
<L>Away the card, away the compasse goes:</L>
<L>In two and thirty points not one point showes,</L>
<L>A line of safety, all the lines that were,</L>
<L>Did point to death, none other center there.</L>
<L>And if AMALFI had at that time found,</L>
<L>The loadstones use, the needle turning round,</L>
<L>Vpon no corner could have faln so true,</L>
<L>As to direct from whence lesse danger grew.</L>
<L>The staff wherewith the height they wont to take,</L>
<L>Now when each sea over the ship doth rake,</L>
<L>Surges whelm surges, billowes doe billowes ride,</L>
<L>(The sea-race running counter to the tide)</L>
<L>Vnusefull is, nor fit a step to stay,</L>
<L>When rocking ships the reeling drunkards play,</L>
<L>And disengorge the seas surcharging waste,</L>
<L>At gushing scuppet-holes, which seem to caste.</L>
<L>The dancing beak-head now doth plunge, and dive,</L>
<L>Then up again before the winde doth drive,</L>
<L>And while upright it stands upon the slide,</L>
<L>The naked bottom may be halfway eyd.</L>
<L>No place for art is left, no place for might,</L>
<L>And every way best pleaseth but the right.</L>
<L>For they the windes must follow not their will.</L>
<L>Obedience was their best, and that was ill.</L>
<L>To minde then first life past hath swift recourse,</L>
<L>Then first the feare of death doth stir remorse,</L>
<L>Awakens memory, represents things done:</L>
<L>And they who labourd riches to have wonne,</L>
<L>By deaths contempt, would all the world now give,</L>
<L>To be but safe on shore, and so to live.</L>
<L>These were the sports of that outragious fiend:</L>
<L>On whom a rabble of his likes attend,</L>
<L>Alike perdues, alike forlorn as he,</L>
<L>But lesse in power, in malice, and degree.</L>
<L>Some ball up clouds to ramme into the winde,</L>
<L>Others new blasts doe labour to unbinde,</L>
<L>And on their backs come feircely riding in,</L>
<L>Before the old ones to surcease begin,</L>
<L>And with their onsets violate the skie,</L>
<L>And betweene whiles doe whole broad-sides let flie.</L>
<L>The Vultures, Harpyes, and all birds of praey,</L>
<L>Took sanctuarie far upon shore away:</L>
<L>Their element is now no longer theirs.</L>
<L>Another shole of ouglier birds appeares,</L>
<L>Which visiblie possesse the troubled clime,</L>
<L>Themselves the sorest tempests of the time.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He had a coat full threefold thicke of brasse,</L>
<L>About his brest, nor for his life did passe,</L>
<L>Who first did dare to trust the sea with ship,</L>
<L>And keels did teach' on billowes backe to skip,</L>
<L>Who first to weather did commit his weal;</L>
<L>Or had strange cause from tyrants power to steal:</L>
<L>As had that man of CRETE, from whose arts fame,</L>
<L>Choice peices carry the DAEDALEAN name.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The ships sides crack, the tackle teres like thred:</L>
<L>Some plie the pump; some cry we all are dead.</L>
<L>Here climbes a nimble boy unto the top,</L>
<L>When him now halfway, or not halfway up,</L>
<L>A gust praevents, which ducks into the deep,</L>
<L>The shrowds themselves, &amp; from the ropes doth sweep</L>
<PB REF="3"/>
<L>The ventrous climer, darting him as farre,</L>
<L>As globe of stone from instrument of warre.</L>
<L>There, to stand fast the one the other bindes,</L>
<L>And both are blown of with the hoisting windes:</L>
<L>Another on his hands and feete doth creep;</L>
<L>Him bounding haches bandie to the deep.</L>
<L>Some trust unto the halliards, and their hold,</L>
<L>The cordage flies, they under seas are rolld.</L>
<L>The giddy ship the sailers braines turnes round,</L>
<L>And strains him so, though hard his browes be bound,</L>
<L>That, as from stricken flints, sparkes seeme to flie,</L>
<L>Throughout his bones, and out at either eie.</L>
<L>If any one lesse sicklie were then so,</L>
<L>Of life lesse weary he, the more his woe.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Muse while this she sings is giddie grown;</L>
<L>And the right reader scarcely keeps his own.</L>
<L>No marvaile then if their braines turned were,</L>
<L>Who of the storm the stresse entire did beare.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The rudder torne away begins the wrack,</L>
<L>Though of the same the lesser was the lack,</L>
<L>For that long since it ceast of use to bee,</L>
<L>And traiterous leaks drunk in the driving sea.</L>
<L>No standing on the decks, no stirring there;</L>
<L>Th' unbridled beast will now no master heare,</L>
<L>But flings the rider, off the sailer shakes;</L>
<L>And each a grave-roome of his cabin makes.</L>
<L>The noise so hvge as shricks of men were drownd;</L>
<L>No anchorage but in vowes; nor in them found.</L>
<L>Not so much saile aloft left hanging there,</L>
<L>As would suffice to wipe away one teare.</L>
<L>The masts cut down, the goods throwne over borde,</L>
<L>And last themselves; all aid's in vaine implorde,</L>
<L>All hands in vain employd, the hull to save,</L>
<L>When gaping comes the fatall finall wave,</L>
<L>Cal'd <HI>Decumane,</HI> which into watrie woomb,</L>
<L>At one suck drawes down all, but gives no toomb;</L>
<L>For what one sea devours another drives,</L>
<L>Rebelching it in mockage of their lives;</L>
<L>And as a load too heavie to digest,</L>
<L>These surges play it over to the rest,</L>
<L>And while one wreck another wreck doth hit,</L>
<L>What seas left whole is so in peices split;</L>
<L>Or cast on beds of sand, or ragged rocks,</L>
<L>The carcasse-selfe dissolving with the shocks.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The planks start out, the ribbs in peices crack,</L>
<L>No timber is so strong, but yeeldeth back,</L>
<L>And as the waves rush in, forth shoots the ware,</L>
<L>Such as remaind t'accompany dispaire.</L>
<L>With them the deeps are spred, here barrels flote,</L>
<L>There packs not yet through-wet, and chests of note,</L>
<L>And men and boyes ride on them while they may,</L>
<L>Then shrick out last farewels and fall away:</L>
<L>The wine with brine doth mix; and mingled so,</L>
<L>The curled fome doth no pure whitenesse show,</L>
<L>But dipt in claret die praetends to blush.</L>
<L>One swallowing surge the Merchants hop's doth crush,</L>
<L>The Factors, Sailers, Childrens, Wives, and Friends:</L>
<L>In wretched losse the whole adventure ends.</L>
<L>And though the Ocean opens to the sky,</L>
<L>Where none alive is neere to bid, or buy,</L>
<L>A world of scattred goods on billowes green,</L>
<L>As at a mart, yet they in vain are seene,</L>
<L>And what his mercy spares, or what the kinde,</L>
<L>Of that which cannot sinck the shore doth finde,</L>
<L>The shore more cruell then the sea devours;</L>
<L>For he who claimes the wreck cries, all is ours.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor with lesse noise then as if from the side,</L>
<L>Of steple rocks a cliff should chance to slide,</L>
<L>And drop into the under-beating seas,</L>
<L>To the great fright of the NEREIDES,</L>
<L>And other wanton nymphs who play by shore,</L>
<L>The sunck ship fals, and beaten waters rore.</L>
</LG>

<L>The ravenous fish, (those wolves of NEPTVNES fie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></L>
<L>A passage short to quick and dead doe yeild,</L>
<L>Through greedy mawes; but corpses thrown on shore▪</L>
<L>Finde buriall there, and people to deplore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The cowerd under hatches feeles the fall,</L>
<L>Not daring sight to use, nor speech at all,</L>
<L>And stops his eares, just as his breath is stopt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But the tall fellow never overtopt,</L>
<L>With basenesse though with brine, in swimming sinks,</L>
<L>And even in sinking of surviving thinks,</L>
<L>Bestrides some maste, layes hold of yard, or planck,</L>
<L>And though among the lost himselfe he ranck,</L>
<L>Yet strives with armes, and leggs to keepe aloft.</L>
<L>And boldnesse so is blest, that not unoft,</L>
<L>God favours his escape, and lets him goe.</L>
<L>"The valiant man against despaire cries No.</L>
<L>"And though of all things else bereft, and left,</L>
<L>"Himselfe he leaves not. God no greater gift▪</L>
<L>"Hath given unto man than such a minde,</L>
<L>"Beneath the which are fortune, seas, and winde,</L>
<L>"Above it nothing else but God alone,</L>
<L>"And to him knit is alwayes so his owne.</L>
