<HEAD>Great News from the English FLEET: OR, THE Seamens Apology For Adhering to His Highness the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> in Defence of the Protestant Religion.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Countrymen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ALthough thro' Custom, and want of better Conversation, our <HI>Natures</HI> may have been so far <HI>Corrupted</HI> and <HI>Deprav'd,</HI> as to degenerate into a Sympathy with the <HI>unruly Element</HI> where∣in we Live; yet, since <HI>God</HI> has, in repeated Examples, signified his <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Providence</HI> to all his <HI>Works,</HI> we who bear an equal <HI>stamp</HI> of Himself and his Goodness, cannot be altogether Insensible of the <HI>Benefits</HI> we have at <HI>this Time,</HI> more especially, received from Him; for, tho' the better part of Us (we may say, the generality) were, in our Hearts, resolv'd to <HI>stand,</HI> and <HI>Dye,</HI> in the Defence of our Holy E∣stablish'd <HI>Religion,</HI> yet the secret <HI>Contrivances</HI> (bearing, notwithstand∣ing, the publick Mark of an <HI>Ill-grounded Authority</HI>) of our <HI>Enemies,</HI> either to <HI>Supplant</HI> or <HI>Displace</HI> the best and chiefest of our <HI>Commanders,</HI> and, by degrees, the <HI>rest,</HI> had given so material a <HI>shock</HI> to our <HI>Hopes</HI> and <HI>Resolutions,</HI> that, till the <HI>Happy News</HI> of your <HI>Wise</HI> and <HI>Couragi∣ous</HI> management of <HI>Affairs</HI> at <HI>Land</HI> Arriv'd, we began grievously to fear, and, in a little time, should have had reason enough to despair of any Success agreeable to our Desires and Expectations. We do therefore first render our Thanks to Almighty <HI>God,</HI> who has sav'd us out of the Jaws of our <HI>Ravenous Enemies;</HI> and next to <HI>You,</HI> for not only Your Faith and Loyalty to Your <HI>Country,</HI> Your <HI>Laws,</HI> and Your <HI>Religion,</HI> but for the good <HI>Example</HI> You have shown us, whereby You have encouraged and strengthened our Hands against the worst, the Malice of our <HI>Common Enemies</HI> can suggest or do. And, to show You our Zeal to the <HI>Common Cause,</HI> we give You to understand, our <HI>Noble Commanders</HI> and our <HI>Selves,</HI> have not been wanting in our <HI>Endeavours</HI> to purge the <HI>Navy,</HI> as You have the <HI>Army,</HI> of all <HI>Papists,</HI> or others dis∣affected to the Well-establish'd <HI>Government</HI> and <HI>Church of England:</HI> Beside, our Care not only to Guard and Defend our Coasts from the expected <HI>Invasions</HI> and <HI>Injuries</HI> of our <HI>Enemies</HI> abroad, but also to hin∣der the Escape and Flight of those <HI>Villains</HI> and <HI>Traytors</HI> who have been as far as in them lay, the <HI>Betrayers</HI> of their <HI>Country,</HI> and our <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Fortunes</HI> to the malicious Designs of our Irreconcilable Enemies.</P>
<P>Let us therefore Congratulate the happy Sympathy of our Hearts, and conclude it the peculiar <HI>Providence</HI> of <HI>God</HI> that has so universally Inspir'd and united the Souls and Hearts of the People of this Kingdom in the Defence of our <HI>Holy Religion.</HI> Let us not be daunt∣ed with the ill-grounded Reproaches of our Enemies, who endeavor first to Divide us, that they may the more easily Destroy us. We cannot be Ignorant of the extent of our Duty to our King, since we show our selves so well-grounded in the knowledge of our Duty to <HI>God;</HI> for since that is wholly dependant on this, it is manifest we are obliged in Conscience and Nature to prosser the Service of our <HI>Heavenly Father,</HI> before that of an <HI>Earthly Master.</HI></P>
