<HEAD>A true Report of all the passages in the Ile of <HI>Ree,</HI> twixt the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> his Grace, and <HI>Monsieur Thorax,</HI> Gouernour of the Fort, as al∣so betwixt the Duke, and the French King, and of the state of the <HI>Rochellers,</HI> and the Kings forces lying before it, to∣gether with other matters of moment lately hapned there. As it was on Sun∣day last being the 25. of <HI>October,</HI> rela∣ted at <HI>White Hall,</HI> by a <HI>Dutchman</HI> that came from thence.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>Bout twelue dayes since it pleased his Ex∣cellencie the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> to dispatch a Dutchman with Letters to his Maiestie concerning the present state of our Armie, lying now in the Ile of <HI>Ree,</HI> and before the Fort or Cittadell there, who saith,
<PB REF="3"/>that about three dayes before his comming away, Sir <HI>William Bourchier</HI> arriued at the Ile with certaine ships furnished with money and victuals, safe and well, which gaue great comfort to his Excellencie, hauing long ex∣pected to heare from <HI>England,</HI> in so much that before his arriuall our Armie was in great distresse for want of pro∣uision and of victuals, and other necessaries, that it was a great question whether they should continue there any longer, or rather giue ouer the further prosecution of the action, in regard of those many extremities that they were brought vnto, hauing beene of a long time not sup∣plyed from <HI>England,</HI> whereupon my Lord taking into consideration, the great dishonour that would redound to the Nation; said that he would for his part aduenture himselfe to the vttermost perils Fortune could obiect a∣gainst him, rather then hee would giue ouer so noble a designe, and did therevpon exhort all his followers and Souldiers to a constant perseuerance in the action, mau∣gre all the difficulties that might ensue saying that hee would participate of the greatest dangers with themenest of his followers, before hee would suffer the dishonour that would accrue vpon the declining of such an action, and further said hee would rather commit himselfe and his whole Armie to the releeuing of the Towne of Ro∣chell before he would returne into England with disho∣nour, or without the accomplishing of the businesse for which he came thither.</P>
<P>For the state of the Fort (notwithstanding some small reliefe they lately had obtayned) is such that in the iudgement of man, it cannot hold out many dayes, for since they haue receiued some reliefe, there hath come forth daily by twenties more or lesse, poore hunger-starued people, which doth demonstrate the state of the rest, hauing had (as they report) only a
<PB REF="3"/>poore pittance of Bread and Water, for a moneth or fiue weekes together, insomuch, that the number in the Fort which they haue remayning for defence, is come from two thousand and odde to fiue hundred, and that of late about two dayes before the comming away of this Messenger, a Dutchman comming out of the Fort, and did deliuer to my Lord Duke the strength of the Fort, and where they were best prouided for defence, what places were weakest, and not able to defend the least assault, should bee made against them. For in reason, if we consider the compasse of the Fort) being about a mile) the besieged with that number of men cannot mayntaine each worke, with enterchange of fresh men, as the necessitie of the siege will require, by which you may gather that they cannot long subsist. Besides my Lord hath taken and doth possesse, two of the principall out-workes of the Enemie, by which they are able to dismount the greatest part of their Ordi∣nance, and in short time to command some other of their best workes, and to giue law vnto them in their owne tro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ches.</P>
<P>Vpon which consideration, together with other infor∣mation receiued, my Lord called a Councell, and did thereupon resolue to assaile them in places of best ad∣uantage, which was to be put in execution immediate∣ly vpon the comming away of this Messenger, not doub∣ting (as this Messenger reports) of a happie Issue, and that the Fort before this is in the possession of the English.</P>
<P>For the further hope of reliefe which they may ex∣pect from the Mayne, my Lord hath taken such care, and hath from Rochell receiued diuers flat bottome
<PB REF="4"/>Boates, which are so linked and chainted together by art, that now it is impossible that any succour should be brought in, in the night, as formerly hath beene; now, whereas some may obiect against my Lords care in suf∣fering the Fort thus at seuerall times to be relieued, I an∣swer, that it is not possible, neither could the wit of man preuent the same, if they will venture at all times, and hazard themselues, but that some of many may scape in, with some small prouision, vnlesse wee could guard the shoare with a sufficient number of Boates aswell night, as day, to preuent which they haue now made a Barracado; as aforesaid.</P>
<P>The French King did lately send a Messenger to my Lord to require a faire quarter to bee obserued by his Excellency, &amp; did promise the like should be obserued on his part, wherunto my Lord sent him this answer, that for his part he would obserue all farre quarters with his Maiestie by land; but by water, he desired him to par∣don him, and sayd, that by water it might disaduan∣him, and therefore would keepe no other quarters then he had done hitherto, and which by the Law of Armes he might iustifie with his Honour.</P>
<P>The French King lying with his Armie before Rochell is verie sicke, and doth suffer much in his Army by seuerall casualties: the new Fort which hee hath lately erected, is much demolished, and diuerse workes belonging to it taken by the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chellers, besides those of Rochell are building another Fort against it, which will be a great annoyance to the Kings Armie.</P>
<P>The Duke of Rohan is marching to the ayd of Ro∣chell with 7000. Foot and 500. Horse well prouided
<PB REF="4"/>and resolute Souldiers. In Lorraine, a Bishop of that Dukedome hath in readinesse 15000. men, which as it is sayd, are prouided, and haue a purpose to fall vpon some parts of the French Kings Dominions, and that the quarrell should be the House of Austria's, besides some other Princes are preparing to inuade him likewise, which will giue the French King his hands full.</P>
<P>My L. Duke and his whole Armie are couragious and in good estate, he hath receiued lately fiue compa∣nies from Rochell of braue resolute fellowes, and hath sent into Rochell all his sicke and hurt men, where they are well releeued of all necessaries.</P>
<P>The Rochellers haue wholly declared themselues for the King of England, as by the Articles which are agreed vpon by my L. Duke and them doth appeare, his Excel∣lencie hath sent word to his Maiestie, that if it please him to send him bread, he will deserue it, but if he will adde vnto it somewhat more he will drinke his health; by which you may see his inuincible courage, zeale and affection to his Countries Honour, which I pray God to prosper.</P>
<P>Since this Messenger came, one Master <HI>Griffin,</HI> a Gentle-man belonging to his Excellencie, arriued in London on Sunday night (who being longer at sea) yet was dispatcht away before this Dutch-man 12. daies, &amp; doth confirme what this Messenger brought, only it was his misfortune to arriue after him, being crost by con∣trarie winds, and the Barke in which hee came in being cast away, and onely himselfe and his fellow-passengers were saued by the mercie of God, together with those packets and other matters of worth, which they had in
<PB REF="5"/>the said Barke, were saued from shipwracke, and can re∣late not much more then the former Messenger.</P>

<P>ON Wednesday last, past an extraordinary Post, of the Merchants of <HI>Genoa</HI> through this City, being sent towards <HI>Naples</HI> by them, seeing that the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> hath transported vnto them his Custome of Silke which he hath in the Kingdome of <HI>Naples,</HI> to get thereby the money which hee oweth vn∣to them.</P>
<P>Here is little newes, seeing that all the Souldiers which were in these parts leauied, are gone into <HI>Ger∣many,</HI> to serue the Emperour, except them which are laid in garison.</P>

<HEAD>From Vienna the <HI>29</HI> of September.</HEAD>
<P>On the 26 of this Moneth is his Imperiall Maiestie with the Empresse, the King of <HI>Hungarie,</HI> and both his daughters, besides many of his Courtiers, gone from hence towards <HI>Prage.</HI> The Prince his yongest Sonne, and the Archduke <HI>Leopoldus</HI> tarrie here.</P>
<P>His Imperiall Maiestie and all them which are gone with him, are to day to keepe at <HI>Nicholas burg</HI> in the house of the Cardinall of <HI>Didrichstein</HI> the feast of Saint <HI>Michael.</HI></P>
<P>The Duke <HI>Iulius Fredericke</HI> of <HI>Wirtenburg</HI> is here daily expected. But it is thought that seeing that the Emperor is departed that he will rest himselfe here some dayes, and goe afterwards to the Emperor.</P>
<P>To day is expired the time which was prefixed to the Protestant Preachers for their departure. But seeing that the raine-water, and otherwaters which haue drowned the Land, haue much spoiled the high-wayes, that they cannot well be vsed, they haue at their request obtained leaue to tarry in this Land some few weekes to dispose in the interim of their affayres, and meanes. They are to for∣sake this land before expiration of three weekes, vpon paine to be seuerely punished.</P>
<P>It is here rumored by many, but belieued by very few, that there a peace concluded betwixt the Emperour and the great Signior for the space of 25. yeares.</P>
<P>Herewith I send the Imperiall Proclamation which hath in this Court by the Clergie beene obtained, and beene printed, and affixed two dayes agoe, and likewise beene sent to diuers other places, by which is commanded that the Preachers, and Schoole-masters which are Pro∣testants shall forsake the Land of <HI>Over-Ens</HI> within a cer∣taine time which is prefixed, and that the exercise of their religion shall neuer any more there be suffered.</P>

<HEAD>From Breslaw the <HI>1</HI> of October.</HEAD>
<P>To day is the Company of Captaine <HI>Swank</HI> discharged which was leauied for this Citie, so that wee haue now no more then three Companies to entertaine.</P>
<P>Wee haue newes from <HI>Thorne</HI> that there is not as yet a peace concluded betwixt the Kings of <HI>Polon</HI> and <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>It continueth not that the Army of <HI>Sweden</HI> hath bene ouerthrowne by the <HI>Poloniuns</HI> as they did formerly write from <HI>Dansick:</HI> But it is certaien that there haue been many slaine of each side, and that both parties retreated againe to their works, and intrenchments.</P>
<P>The Ambassadors, and Commissioners meet yet dayly, and it is reported that the Swedish propound very hard conditions of peace, namely, that the King of <HI>Poland</HI> should resigne for euer for him and his heires the title and claime which hee hath or pretendeth to the Kingdome of <HI>Sweden:</HI> That the King of <HI>Poland</HI> should giue to the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> 80 tunnes of gold for the payment of his soul∣diers, and warlike expences: As likewise that the King of <HI>Poland</HI> should suffer him to enioy for the space of tenne yeares all the places which he hath taken in <HI>Prussia,</HI> and af∣ter the expiration of them, hee should restore them againe to the Crowne of <HI>Poland,</HI> besides diuers other difficult points vnto which the King of <HI>Poland</HI> will not agree.</P>
<P>On Saturday last here was one beheaded before the Towne house, because he kill'd a Coach-man.</P>
<P>To day is here published a Proclamation of the Empe∣ror by which he causeth all the lands and goods to bee confiscated of them which went to serue Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> in the late warres.</P>
<P>They write from <HI>Neus</HI> that no Protestants are suffered there to marry, vnlesse they imbrace the Romish Religion. But if they will not doe it, they may sell their lands, and goods, and depart thence.</P>

<P>They write from <HI>Millaine</HI> that all the souldiers of the Lord of <HI>Pappenheim</HI> are marched through <HI>Ʋeltolina</HI> into <HI>Germanie,</HI> and that they of the Count of <HI>Solms</HI> are shortly to follow them. The Colonell <HI>Piccolomini</HI> is likewise past thorow <HI>Chur,</HI> with 40 horse to follow them.</P>
<P>We haue newes from <HI>Genoa,</HI> that there is a peace con∣cluded betwixt the Duke of <HI>Sauoy,</HI> &amp; the said Signeurie, and that although the said Signeurie hath discharged sixe Companies of Italians, that they take neuerthelesse Ger∣maines into their seruice in lieu of them.</P>
<P>We learne from <HI>France</HI> that the Duke of <HI>Momorancy</HI> is gathering great forces against the Protestants of <HI>France,</HI> and that he is appointed to besiege the Towne of <HI>Nimis,</HI> in which the Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> is in person: As likewise that they make there great warlike preparations by water a∣gainst the English.

<HEAD>From Dansicke the <HI>7.</HI> of September.</HEAD>
<P>On the 24 of August after dinner time went the Duke of <HI>Holstein</HI> into the field to looke out for a conuenient place to inquarter his leger (which is separated from that of the <HI>Polonians</HI>) to whom are likewise ioyned the Forces of the two Commanders named <HI>Dohnhof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</HI></P>
<P>On the 29 of August about the euening came the King of <HI>Poland</HI> with many men of note, and his Courtiers, and followers into this City, and was with great state and pompe fetcht into it by our Citizens; and well entertained afterwards by our Magistrates.</P>
<P>The day before were the Ambassadours of the States Generall of the Vnited Prouinces of the Low-Counties
<PB N="11" REF="7"/>which labour very earnestly to make peace betwixt <HI>Po∣land</HI> and <HI>Sweden</HI>) gone towards the Polon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an Generall of the Field.</P>
<P>On the first of September went the King of <HI>Poland</HI> to see and to view our walls, and all our sconces, and works round about this City, and especially the new raised sconce, which the souldiers cal commonly <HI>Schenke-sconce,</HI> by reason of the strength of it: and at the same time there were 44 peeces of ordnance discharged, besides many muskets both by water and land. The King liking these workes exceedingly well, reioyced much at it, and com∣mended much to his Lords the endeauors and faithful∣nesse of the Dansickers, saying that they had well labou∣red, and were his loyall seruants, and that they had not done as they of <HI>Elbingen,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>On the second of September went the King of Poland with the Prince his sonne, and diuers great Lords, be∣sides our Burgemasters, and some of our Aldermen, ear∣ly in the morning toward the Fort which is called <HI>Weich∣selmundt,</HI> and when they had viewed there all things very well, our Magistrates did feast very stately both the King and his followers, and about the euening there were many pieces of ordnance discharged both in the 12 Ships which lay thereabout, and in the Sconces. And it happened that about the same time, that a Galley of the King of <HI>Poland</HI> being put to Sea to try whether it could well sayle, it encountred with a Swedish ship, and had a pretty combat both with it, and 3 other for a little while, which were afterwards cruelly battered by our ordnance which lay in a sconce neere which the Swedish followed the said Gally. The said King hauing seene this sport with contentment, returned the same euening againe to the said City, and departed from thence on the 4 of this moneth, three Postes being sent to him, and went directly towards his Army.</P>
<P>In the weeke which is last past were the Ambassadors
<PB N="12" REF="8"/>together, and the Polonians were to propound some ar∣ticles of peace betwixt <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>

<HEAD>From Brunswicke the 2 of October.</HEAD>
<P>We haue nor as yet any other newes from the Depu∣tations day which is appointed to be kept at <HI>Mulhowsen,</HI> but that diuers Ambassadors as of the Emperor, Electors, Princes, and States of the Empire, are gone thitherward.</P>
<P>They of <HI>Wolfenbuttel</HI> although they are very close im∣blocked, sally neuerthelesse daily forth, and slue few dayes agoe many Imperiall souldiers and husbandmen that would stop the water which runneth to the sayd Towne.</P>
<P>The Towne of <HI>Newburg,</HI> or the Gouernor of it, name∣ly the Colonell <HI>Limbach</HI> hath offered to surrender it vp∣on certaine conditions to the Duke of <HI>Lunnenburg,</HI> and amongst the rest, that the Emperour should grant a gene∣rall pardon to them that are in it. But if that be refused, he will blow vp the said Towne, and ruine all that is therein.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="entry">
<HEAD>From Ʋerden the <HI>8</HI> of October.</HEAD>
<P>Both the Imperiall and Danish souldiers make them∣selues daily stronger and stronger in this Bishopricke. The Danish hauing raised a strong sconce at <HI>Borcht</HI> to maintaine themselues there, they haue fired the Towne of <HI>Verden,</HI> and burned it quite to the ground.</P>
<P>From <HI>Newburg</HI> we heare no newes, seeing that the said Towne being now very strictly besieged, the Posts which come from <HI>Cullen</HI> haue altered their passage, and trauelled by the way of <HI>Newstadt:</HI> But it is thought that it shall be surrendred if the Gouernor of it can obtaine a pardon of the Emperor, seeing that he hath had it twice before.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="8"/>
<P>The Imperialists make great warlike preparations to beat the Danish quite out of the Bishopricke of <HI>Bremen</HI> of which we shall shortly heare more.</P>

<P>This Towne is replenished with Danish Souldiers, but they are in great feare, seeing that the Imperialists strengthen themselues daily in those parts.</P>
<P>Our Bishop who is now at <HI>Lubecke,</HI> as likewise the Imperiall Ambassadors which are yet at <HI>Hamburg,</HI> ex∣hort the States of these Lands that they will remember the oath which they haue made to the Emperor.</P>
