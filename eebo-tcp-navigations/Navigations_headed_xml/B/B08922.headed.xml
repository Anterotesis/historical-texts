<P>THE Grand Signiour having Grounds to fear the GOD may have a Design to make use of the Rod of His Indignation, for the Chastisement of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, and the <HI>Sultan</HI> to prevents his falling together with his Subjects into the Hands of the <HI>Chri∣stians</HI> his Enemys, Ardently wishes that the Anger of GOD may be appaced by the means of the Procession of the great <HI>Machomet</HI> for which Reason, he strictly Commands, that all and every one of his Subjects Fast twice a week, Viz. On <HI>Monday</HI> and <HI>Friday</HI> in the most Rigorous manner, abstaining from all kind of Food and Drink till the Eevening; And on the said Days, the High Priest, with his Ecclesiastical Assistants are Commanded, immediatly to appear Covered with Ashes, and to go in Procession through the Streets with Digected counte∣nances, and cry alloud in the Ears of the Inhabitants of <HI>Mecca</HI> the following words, <HI>O GOD assist thy People.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Sultan</HI> furthermore Commands, that <HI>Machomets</HI> Coffin be carryed into a publick place, and laid upon Four Golden Columns, Sarrounded with Twelve other Coffins full of their Saints Bones, that by their means the great <HI>Machomet</HI> may not faill on his part to pacify the Anger of GOD. The great <HI>Sultan</HI> Commands likewise, that all the Strangers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat shall be in <HI>Mecca,</HI> together with the Inhabitants of that Town shall Seven times walk in Proces∣sion round that Tomb in the open Country, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rying, Houling and Groaning, and the <HI>Turkish</HI> Priests are on this Occasion, to Speak to the People, and Represent to them the great mis∣fortunes the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Port has suffered for some Years past, and that, if they do not Repent, they will Experience, by their Ruin, the Wrath of GOD.</P>
<P>UPON these Days of Penitence and Procession all Sorts of Musick, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Are forbidden amongst the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
