<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is fifteene yeares agoe, since the Peace was broke betweene <HI>France</HI> and Vs; the cause of that breach was by reason that a certaine <HI>French-man,</HI> a renegado or revolted Christi∣an had stolen out of the Library of the King of <HI>Maroco</HI> among other Bookes all Saint <HI>Augustines</HI> Workes, written with that holy Fathers owne hand, which were bound vp so costly with pearles and preci∣ous stone, that they were valued at the worth of millions of <HI>Florens.</HI> This renegado convayed those Bookes into <HI>Spaine,</HI> where they are reserved vntill this day. But now there is a treatie in hand to re-establish the former Peace betweene the <HI>French</HI> and Vs. To this end by the commaund of his King the Cardinall <HI>Richelieu</HI> hath sent two Deputies, who haue al∣ready concluded a good Peace betweene the <HI>Moores</HI> and the <HI>French.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>From <HI>Wittenbergh</HI> the <HI>21.</HI> of <HI>December.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A few dayes since the Queene of <HI>Sweden</HI> arrived here a∣bout nine of the clock in the evening, and was well received. A few houres after, arrived a messenger from the King, with many costly presents sent to the Queene, which presents were Church-ornaments which his Majestie hath obtained for bootie, among other things, an Image of the childe Iesus
<PB N="2" REF="3"/> of pure gold. And two other Images, one the Salvator of silver, and the head of fine pure gold. Another of St. <HI>Martin</HI> of pure gold. And many other the like toyes. Which were seene of all men that would. These images were garnished with Diamonds and costly Stones.</P>
<P>The <HI>Swedish</HI> haue taken <HI>Rohenfeld,</HI> and slaine about 800. men there. <HI>Freydenburgh,</HI> in the <HI>Wetteran</HI> is also taken by them. <HI>Eger</HI> in <HI>Bohemia</HI> is also taken by fiue Companies of <HI>Saxonians</HI> with the helpe of the Citizens.</P>
<P>The great overthrow of the Commaunder <HI>Dieffenback</HI> and <HI>Gotzens</HI> Army by the <HI>Saxonians,</HI> vnder the Commander <HI>Arn∣heym</HI> is now certainly confirmed.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>From <HI>Norimberg</HI> the <HI>22.</HI> of <HI>December.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> with the Commander <HI>Altringer</HI> a few dayes since passed by here, from <HI>Swabach</HI> to <HI>Gigitserhof</HI> with all their forces, thorough the wood, as also <HI>Papenheyms</HI> forces, their march continued at least six houres in passing by. Wee made after them at least with fiftie Canon shot from this Ci∣tie. They marched to <HI>Roodt,</HI> where the Generall lay still two nights; from thence he departed to <HI>Donaweerdt,</HI> to treate with <HI>Bavaria.</HI> He hath parted his Army into three parts, with one part the Commaunder <HI>Altringer</HI> is marched into <HI>Bohemia,</HI> the other into <HI>Swaben,</HI> and with the third the Gene∣rall is to remaine in <HI>Bavaria.</HI> He hath braue Cavallery, but very poore and impotent foote-forces. In their March from <HI>Ansbach</HI> to <HI>Guntsbach,</HI> they left behinde them in the streetes and wayes aboue 1500. sicke and dead Sou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>diers. The Com∣maunder <HI>Murtha</HI> at this present is still at <HI>Loef, Harsburgh,</HI> and the adjoyning Villages: at <HI>Loef</HI> he hath shut vp two of the Gates, intends to winter there. But as soone as the <HI>Swe∣dish</HI> reliefe shall be come hither (which daily is expected) he will haue no great stomacke to remaine there long, but to depart with his forces both from thence and other places. The Magistrates of this Citie are now very well affected to the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and will in no wise hearken to the Em∣perour, they cause great search to be made continually. Some of those which held correspondency with the Emperour are
<PB N="3" REF="3"/> held close prisoners, and some others were rackt, so that the very next day they dyed.</P>
<P>Neare vnto <HI>Hasfurt</HI> many new levied forces for the Empe∣rour assemble together, which shall be mustered in the Bi∣shopricke of <HI>Bambergh.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>From the <HI>Lower Palatinate 23.</HI> Ditto.</HEAD>
<P>It is written that the 17. of this moneth the strong Sconce by <HI>Oppenheym</HI> was yeelded to his Majestie of <HI>Sweden</HI> by a∣greement. Which Sconce being taken, his Majestie caused the Citie and Castle to be furiously assaulted, which were ta∣ken by force. Those of the Citie had Quarter, but those in the Castle were all slaine. But hereof we must expect more cer∣taintie, there being come other Letters that say, <HI>Oppenheym</HI> was surrendred vpon composition. The convenient passage over the <HI>Rhyne</HI> was discovered and made knowne to his Ma∣jestie by a certaine Shipper of <HI>Wormes,</HI> nam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Hild,</HI> who in the night time brought downe from <HI>Worms</HI> two great Ponts, and many small Boates downe the <HI>Rhyne,</HI> with which vessels he vndertooke to transport his Majesties Army over the <HI>Rhyne</HI> at <HI>Stockstadt.</HI> His Majestie himselfe went over in the first Pont, who with small resistance landed his foot Forces, which kept the Horsemen of the Emperour play so long till his Majesties horse were also landed. Which caused them presently to retire, <HI>Gernsheym</HI> (where 350. men were in gar∣rison) yeelded presently to the King of <HI>Sweden.</HI> The strong hold called <HI>Steyn,</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> also left, but they first fired the same. The <HI>Lorrain</HI> forces left <HI>Wormes</HI> in like manner, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e they did great harme with pillaging. The whole <HI>Berghstra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> is now in the King of <HI>Swedens</HI> power, onely <HI>Starckenburgh</HI> excepted. Also <HI>Laudenbergh</HI> is the Kings, who very quietly and willingly surrendred.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>From <HI>Mentz 22.</HI> Ditto.</HEAD>
<P>The 19. of this moneth, the <HI>Spanish</HI> fired all the Shippes that were before this Citie, amongst which also was the great Ship of the Elector. After this, all the Commaunders and Officers caused their Wagons and horses to be in readi∣nesse and sadled, and so they were kept ready twentie-foure
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> houres together, desiring to depart and to be gone before the comming of his Majesties Army, for they durst not stay till then. They pillaged many houses, and killed most inhumane∣ly many of the Citizens, at least 19. or 20. Whereupon the Citizens taking their recourse to the Commaunders made an earnest Complaint to them, as namely, to <HI>Wigdenhorst,</HI> and the Commaunder <HI>Waldeck,</HI> who laboured to appease the Souldi∣ers, and suppresse their insolencies and misdemeanours, but the Souldiers were so farre from listning to their admoniti∣ons, that they laughed them to scorne, and rayled at them with all manner of base termes.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>From <HI>Franckford</HI> the <HI>24.</HI> Ditto.</HEAD>
<P>After his Majestie had taken <HI>Oppenheym</HI> and many other places in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> he marched to <HI>Mentz,</HI> which Citie yesterday was yeelded vp to the said King. The <HI>Spanish</HI> which were in that Citie haue pillaged many houses of the same, and abused the Citizens extreamely, left the same, and so be∣tooke themselues to <HI>Franckendale</HI> and other places.</P>
<P>It is thought that <HI>Franckendale</HI> by this time is taken, for we haue heard great shooting. There lay a strong Garrison in <HI>Franckendale</HI> of 7000. men, and of them were 5000. <HI>Spani∣ards.</HI> Wee vnderstand that the <HI>Dutch</HI> haue betaken them∣selues into his Majesties service.</P>
<P>The Landt-Grave of <HI>Hessen</HI> is yet on this side of the <HI>Rhyne,</HI> in the <HI>Rhynegaw,</HI> even neare <HI>Bingen,</HI> so that now his Majestie hath shut vp the <HI>Rhyne,</HI> both aboue and below. At this pre∣sent the <HI>Swedish</HI> march to <HI>Creutznach.</HI></P>
<P>After that the Magistracy and Councell of this Citie had taken the oath of fidelitie to his Majestie of <HI>Sweden.</HI> His Ma∣jestie gaue vnto every of the chiefe Magistrates a golden Chaine, with a peece of Gold, wherein was engraven his Majesties Image, and to the Aldermen and inferiour Magi∣strates he gaue a Golden Cup. Strong levie is made for the Landt-graue of <HI>Hessen,</HI> the Bishopricke of <HI>Fulda</HI> and <HI>Pater∣born:</HI> there are alreadie thirtie Companies compleate, and at <HI>Cassel</HI> twelue Companies more of foote and six Cornets of horse, which very speedily are to march forth.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4"/>
<P>Yesterday here were mustered 1200. new levied Soul∣diers and divided into 6. Companies.</P>
<P><HI>Over-wesell, Bobert</HI> and <HI>Coblentz</HI> are beset with <HI>Spanish</HI> for∣ces. The Castles in the Mountaines are againe well furnished with provision.</P>
<P>The Landtgraue of <HI>Hessen</HI> hath taken the Castle <HI>Erenfels,</HI> and the Blockhouse over against <HI>Bingen.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>Another the <HI>25.</HI> Ditto.</HEAD>
<P>After his Majestie had taken <HI>Oppenheym,</HI> the garrison in <HI>Worms</HI> fled; those of <HI>Mentz</HI> in like manner after they had most wickedly behaved themselues among the Citizens. The Garrisons that fled from <HI>Mentz</HI> were pursued by some <HI>Swedish</HI> forces, and are vtterly defeated: the <HI>Swedish</HI> in the said exploit obtained a very great bootie. It is now without all question that his Majestie hath taken <HI>Mentz,</HI> some report that his Majestie is in <HI>Frankendale</HI> also, of which I shall bet∣ter certifie you hereafter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>From <HI>Cullen</HI> the <HI>28.</HI> Ditto.</HEAD>
<P>The Regiment levied at <HI>Luyck</HI> vnder Colonell <HI>Lambay</HI> was mustered before this Citie in the presence of our Elector the Commaunder <HI>Pappenheym</HI> and the Earle of <HI>Ysenburg.</HI> The Regiment of <HI>Newhousen</HI> shall march with them into <HI>West∣phalia.</HI> The two other Regiments of Horse, as that of <HI>Wester∣holt</HI> and <HI>Westphalia</HI> are in the Bishopricke of <HI>Munster.</HI> It is supposed that they will labour with this Armie to beset and guard the River <HI>Weser.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Graef Heudricke Vanden bergh</HI> is with his Lady arrived at <HI>Dusseldorf,</HI> to visite the Duke of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> and congratulate his marriage.</P>
<P>Here is great inquirie made for a great dwelling house for some great Lord, it is thought for the Archbishop of <HI>Mentz.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD>From <HI>Paris</HI> the <HI>28.</HI> December.</HEAD>
<P>It is certaine that his Majestie perceiving that the Gover∣nour of <HI>Millan</HI> did by all subtilties and divices levie forces underhand and made a secret preparation for warre: and did labour to divert and seduce the Allies of his Majestie; as namely the <HI>Grizons, Switzers, Valtoliners,</HI> some with gifts and monies, other with threats, by that meanes at the begin∣ning
<PB N="6" REF="5"/> of the Spring to fall into those Countries, and so endan∣ger <HI>Montferat</HI> and <HI>Mantua;</HI>) hath sent therevpon his for∣ces which came from those parts backe againe. And besides this hath sent the Duke <HI>de Rohan</HI> as Generall into the <HI>Valtolin,</HI> both with men and monies, there to ensure all places with good Garrisons, and to fortifie some other which he hath al∣ready done. So that all the Frontiers as well of <HI>Mylan</HI> as <HI>Germanie</HI> are very well kept with <HI>Switzers</HI> and <HI>French.</HI> Mar∣shall <HI>Thorax</HI> is gone into the Citadell of <HI>Cassall</HI> at the Kings injunction with 600. <HI>French;</HI> and he makes great preparati∣on against the next Spring.

<HEAD>Another from the same place.</HEAD>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lorraine</HI> is againe returned to <HI>Nancy,</HI> where he is bed-rid with sicknesse; his Troupes in <HI>Germanie</HI> are late∣ly dispersed, and his Lieutenant Gene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all Prince of <HI>Palsburg</HI> is lately deceased, as it is written, but the truth hereof wee must expect.</P>
<P>The Kings Majestie was lately at <HI>Verdun,</HI> from thence went to <HI>Mentz,</HI> he hath sent from <HI>Paris</HI> for his Scepter, Royall robes and ornaments, &amp;c. so that it is very probable that hee will not very soone returne againe into <HI>France:</HI> he hath cho∣sen in his absence for his Lieutenant General the Lord Count <HI>de Soyson.</HI></P>

<HEAD>From <HI>Wimpsen</HI> the <HI>10.</HI> of December.</HEAD>
<P>I have not of long written unto you, because we dare not write, it being dangerous every where about us. How∣soever I thought good to hazard this little letter, to tell you, that the Imperialists have not lost their presumption as yet. There are many Garrisons in the Townes alongst the River of <HI>Tanber,</HI> so that the warre may well hold out a while thereabouts.</P>
<P>The Towne of <HI>Bambeg,</HI> and the strong Towne of <HI>For∣cheim</HI> hold out both likewise, there lying strong Garri∣sons in the same of the Emperors forces, who do now hin∣der that Bishop, to doe what else he would doe, so that by calling in those defenders, he hath put himselfe under their guardianship like a child, and will be undone worse by them then if he had fulfilled the Treaty he first beganne with the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> whose forces have spoiled all his Country, so that when the Imperialists shall have spent their provisions, they will without any strokes forsake the said places. I can tell you no certaine newes out of <HI>Bohe∣mia,</HI> for some say and write one thing, some another. But as for <HI>Mentz,</HI> that is taken, and the Towne and Vniversity there have rendred thēselves upon cōposition to the King, paying (as I am informed) in ready mony 80000. Ryxdol∣lers. I understand also, that the Spaniards, <HI>y<SUP>t</SUP></HI> were the repu∣ted defenders thereof, before they ran away from thence, playd many Spanish tricks, robbing some rich Burgers, and not sparing the Canons and Church men, and committing many insolencies and violences, but especially (as it is written) they poysoned the principall fountaine there▪ whereby a mortality was occasioned, that there dyed dai∣ly about 30. or 40. Burgers and souldiers. But these offen∣ding defenders will shortly receive the payment due unto them. The King found exceeding great store of warlike amunitions in that Towne, especially of powder and shot, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter written from <HI>Bonne</HI> the <HI>30.</HI> of December.</HEAD>
<P>I Am assured by Letters, that <HI>Tilly</HI> hath beene with the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> at <HI>Munden,</HI> and it is confirmed that he is both uncapable and unwilling to continue in his charge of Generall, so that now it is beleeved, he will put in execution his resolution long since taken, to make him∣selfe a Monke.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> is now at <HI>Donawert,</HI> with the Deputies o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the three Ecclesiasticall Electors, to consult a∣bout their affaires And it is said that the said Electors are shortly to meet i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> person at <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>len,</HI> which is easie for them, for our Prince is already there, and the two others he of <HI>Mentz</HI> and of <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rie,</HI> are not farre off.</P>

<P>It is confirmed that the Swedish and Saxonionian Army have met with the Imperiall Army in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and have had a bloudy fight, but the victory fell to the Swedish and Saxons: And that thereupon <HI>Arnheym</HI> went presently before <HI>Limpurg,</HI> and besieging the same in one or two dayes, tooke the same by force.

<P>VVE doe learne by some Letters, that the Duke of <HI>Friedland</HI> will come againe upon the stage, and that he hath at last accepted, to be Generall for the Em∣peror in <HI>Bohemia</HI> and in his hereditary dominions for a certaine time.</P>
<P>Wee doe also vnderstand, that the <HI>Swedes</HI> have taken the Imperiall towne of <HI>Frieburg,</HI> and that the Spaniards have forsaken <HI>Baccarach</HI> and all other places along the <HI>Rhine,</HI> So that if the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> should take <HI>Coblents,</HI> we can∣not see, who can hinder him to take both <HI>Bonne</HI> and this Citty of <HI>Collen,</HI> And indeed I have heard from the mouth of a Cheife Minister of our Elector heere. That his Prince is in great perplexity, and sayes, that he cannot imagine whether in the world hee could flye for his safety. The French King, in whom consists all his hope being farre from him, and he will not trust himselfe into the Spaniards hands.</P>
<P><HI>Koningstein,</HI> being a Castle upon a high hill and esteemed impregnable, hath beene taken by the Landgrave of <HI>Hes∣sen,</HI> you know of what a great consequence that Castle is, commanding all the Country about. There hath beene found great store of provision, and above 60. peeces of brasse Ordnance. I doe heare that the said Landgrave lost
<PB N="12" REF="8"/> one of his yonger brothers there, who was shot. But howsoever he hath done a noble and great service by ta∣king so strong a place.</P>
<P><HI>Spire</HI> is also treating with the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> and will receive Garrison as well as <HI>Worms.</HI> We doe now receive newes, that some of the Swedish horse commanded by a Rhinegrave, have defeated Collonel <HI>Fust,</HI> who comman∣ded many forces in the Palatinate, both for the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> and the Spaniard, and hath taken from them five Cornets, which he hath sent to the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to <HI>Mentz,</HI> where his Majesty keepes his Campe royall.</P>

<P>The Magistrate of <HI>Collen</HI> hath assuredly sent some De∣puties unto the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> to make some agreement with him, whereof you shall shortly, heare more.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Lorraine Pfaltsburgh</HI> is come home again, and hath brought the corps of his Brother in law with him, who dyed lately in <HI>Germany:</HI> So all the fruits, which that Duke hath gotten by his assistance given to the Em∣peror, seemes to be Repentance.</P>
<P>What the French King intends to doe, is not knowne, but it is well presumed. That the Ecclesiasticall Electors and the Duke of <HI>Bavaria</HI> (who all seeme to forsake the house of <HI>Austria</HI> and consequently the Spaniards) have their onely trust and hope upon that King, either to helpe them against the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> or to bee a meanes for their neutrality with him, whereof time will shortly shew the effects.</P>
