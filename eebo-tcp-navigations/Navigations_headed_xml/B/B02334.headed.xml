<HEAD>POEM ON HIS <HI>Royal Highnesses Restauration</HI> to the Dignity of Lord High Admiral of England, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THe Royal Name of <HI>YORK</HI> has too much worth,</L>
<L>For any Common Mouth to Trumpet forth,</L>
<L>His Praise; for who dares venture to relate</L>
<L>The glorious progress of his Royal Fate,</L>
<L>Must be acquainted first that's Royal Sire</L>
<L>Highly esteem'd him, (whom all ought t'admire)</L>
<L>Instructed him in all Obedience,</L>
<L>When he shou'd die unto his Son the Prince;</L>
<L>Which took such lasting root in <HI>YORKS</HI> great heart,</L>
<L>That he ne'r from that Royal Law did start.</L>
<L>His Youth was season'd with the generous Rules,</L>
<L>The Gravest and most Learned in the Schools</L>
<L>Cou'd teach him, and when that his Age began</L>
<L>To spur him forwards to become a man,</L>
<L>He as impatient of the ling ring time,</L>
<L>Did force his Youth Honors high mount to climbe;</L>
<L>Early he thrust his budding Glories out</L>
<L>In foreign Courts; most Princes round about,</L>
<L>Hearing our Hero's Gallantris, Proclaim</L>
<L>The thriving Glorys of his infant Fame:</L>
<L>The French and Spanish King who Grac'd his hands</L>
<L>With th' highest Dignities of their Commands;</L>
<L>By Experience found his Valour such a Prize,</L>
<L>That none excell'd, and few cou'd Equalize;</L>
<L>Therefore my Muse with empty Graces Sings</L>
<L>His Fame, which has been better sung by Kings.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then let us with thankful Reverence,</L>
<L>On bended Knees for his great Providence,</L>
<L>Worship the Rider on the Heav'nly Throne,</L>
<L>Who for him show'd his great Salvation,</L>
<L>Who sav'd him from the raging Lyon-Dutch,</L>
<L>Nor suffer'd one of his curs'd Paws to touch</L>
<L>His Royal head, next that the baystrous Seas,</L>
<L>Which hundreds then devour'd, durst not to seize</L>
<L>His Life preserving it for higher things,</L>
<L>To subject <HI>Scotland</HI> to the best of Kings,</L>
<L>And tho' the heaven permitted swearing <HI>Otes,</HI></L>
<L>To be the Bell-Weather to lead the Votes,</L>
<L>Of a rash Parliament to Vote him down,</L>
<L>And Bar him from his just Succession,</L>
<L>Yet still preserves his Title to the Crown.</L>
<L>Which sav'd him also from the powers of Hell,</L>
<L>(The place appointed for all that rebell,)</L>
<L>The Authors of that dire Conspiracy,</L>
<L>Against his Life and's Sacred Majesty;</L>
<L>That be might raise him up again above,</L>
<L>All Malice to his Sacred Brothers Love:</L>
<L>Who hath restored him both by Sea and Land,</L>
<L>To the high Trust of which he had Command.</L>
<L>Thus Arm'd by his Brothers power, senc'd with the Prayr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="â€¢"/></L>
<L>Of Loyal hearts th' Illustrious <HI>Hero</HI> dares,</L>
<L>Do any thing that can be underrstood,</L>
<L>To tend unto his Soveraigns honor and the good.</L>
<L>Of all the Subjects of this happy <HI>Isle,</HI></L>
<L>Which has so long been graced with the smile</L>
<L>Of Hea ven, whilst all our Neighbring Countrys are,</L>
<L>Shook by the constant Earthquakes of a War.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Therefore in vain shall earth and hell combine,</L>
<L>To part his Tittle from the Royal Line,</L>
<L>And with Religious mask their Plots conceal,</L>
<L>Sinceth Authors and the crimes Heaven did reveal,</L>
<L>And Earth Revenge, and may all Plotters be,</L>
<L>Still Branded with Eternal Insamy,</L>
<L>Who shall Conspire against great <HI>Charles</HI> and <HI>Thee.</HI></L>
