<HEAD>Extract of a letter from Cassell of the last of Decemb. <HI>1640.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Although this winter weather (which proveth exceeding cold in these parts) seemeth fitter for consultations than for a∣ction, yet doe the Commanders of the Union goe on in their designes and activitie, leaving for the Imperialists (if they will take it) that part of consulting and providing what to doe a∣gainst the Spring. Howsoever because I have as yet no extra∣ordinarie newes (besides the blocking up of Wolfenbuttle, and the marching of <HI>Bannier</HI> with his Army) of action for you at this time: I will supply the want thereof by communicating to you the copie of a letter written by Generall <HI>Bannier,</HI> dated at Erford the 25. Decemb. last 1640. saying thus:</P>
<P>Be pleased to understand, that on the 23. of November last I broke up with mine Armie from Pickenburg and am now here arrived: And having on the second of this moneth had a conference at Duderstat with the French and Wymarian Com∣manders, they thereupon took resolution and order with their Forces to march on, and follow me. Concerning mine armie, I can say (and thank God for it) that the little rest, which the same hath by my care enjoyed in those quarters I provided for them in Westphalia, Brunswig and Luneburg, both my Caval∣lerie and Infanterie hath much been mended &amp; restored, so that I am come againe into the field with much stronger and better Troops than I had before: whilest I am advertised from divers places by prisoners, that the enemies remaine still in an ill con∣dition, and are now dispersed into their quarters. Therefore I am resolved nothing to neglect, but observing and following my reason of war, to take speedily my way towards those parts, where by the power and help of God I hope to effect my de∣signes: wherein, although I am not so presumptuous as to de∣spise or neglect the enemy; yet neverthelesse I am resolved, in
<PB N="484" REF="9"/>case he come forth to stop, or hinder my endevours and pro∣gresse, upon any occasion that he shall offer me, still to be ready and in a good posture to give him battle, and to doe my utter∣most for the good Cause, wishing onely and praying heartily, that Almightie God by his hand doe so conduct and prosper the armes of her Majestie of Sweden, and all other Protestants, &amp; so resist those of their enemies, that at length we may attaine the desired scope, namely, a firme honest peace for all those that stand for the Gospell. The Forces of Brunswig, Luneburg and Hessen, are at this time in their quarters in Westphalia, Frees∣land, and other Dukedomes of their owne for particular de∣signes, which neverthelesse doe conduce us in generall. But I hope (according to their promises) in case our enemies should againe so encrease against the future Spring or Summer, that my army should grow inferiour to theirs, our said friends and allies will then againe be ready to joyne, and march with us to∣gether, as necessitie shall require: that wee may with a generall resolution get a generall victory and honour together.</P>
<P>Thus much saith <HI>Bannier,</HI> who since that time is arrived at Seitz, and gone from thence to Altenburg, and so in Voitland, and the Wymarian Forces are two leagues from him, at New∣stat: Their march being said to goe directly to the upper Pala∣tinate, and to visit the Dyet at Ratisbone.</P>
