<HEAD>TO THE Right Honourable THE EARL OF <HI>CLANRICARDE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Good Fortune which has always at∣tended me by Sea and Land, in my last Travels in∣to the <HI>Levant,</HI> incourages me to presume, that that same Providence, which more
<PB REF="4"/> especially assigns certain <HI>Ge∣nius's</HI> to watch over the safety of such Persons, which it culls out for the Execution of the greatest Enterprises, cast an Eye upon me, from the very Moment that I de∣parted from <HI>London,</HI> with a Resolution to find your Lordship out, in whatever part of the World you were. That Providence doubtless it was, which having snatch'd me from the gaping Jaws of Dragons in <HI>France,</HI> and deliver'd me from several dangers and hazards which I ran both upon the one and the other Sea, diverted also
<PB REF="4"/> from my Heart the Sharp pointed Dagger of a <HI>Megera,</HI> which Hell it self had vo∣mited up to overwhelm me at <HI>Venice:</HI> This Providence it was that staid a small Vessel at <HI>Marseilles</HI> for seven Months together, till the day that I arriv'd to embark my self for <HI>Smyrna,</HI> &amp; to be there before your Lordship was to depart, in pursuance of other Voyages quite contra∣ry to the Advantage of your Affairs, and which I could never discover. At length being happily return'd home under the Conduct of your successful Patronage, after
<PB REF="5"/> I had travell'd Six thousand nine hundred Miles by Sea or by Land in four Months time, I flatter'd my self, that in Dedicating to your Lord∣ship this little Piece, which departs from my Study upon a Voyage to the Republick of the Curious, it might find the same Good Fortune as the Author of it. Tho' indeed a stronger Reason oblig'd me to procure it this Honour; that is to say, the Grandeur of a Name which has preserv'd it self untar∣nish d in the Nobility of your Family for many Ages, even till this very day in
<PB REF="5"/> your own Illustrious Person. For you are descended from that Great <HI>Hero,</HI> who assisted <HI>William the Conqueror</HI> to lay the Foundations of a Mo∣narchy, which the Sword of your Ancestors has ever since upheld with the hazard of their Lives. Witness that Thunder-bolt of War, the Deceased Earl your Father, who for having taken up Arms in the defence of the King his Master, had lost his Head, had not the Ven∣geance of Heaven crusht the Tyrant who had condemn'd him by the means of a small number of Judges and Ju∣ry
<PB REF="6"/> Men, that then acknow∣ledg'd no other Law than Absolute Power. And your Lordship, the true Off-spring of so many Hero's, tracing their Glorious Examples, declar'd your self against your best Friend, so soon as he appear'd to be an Enemy to the King his Father, whose Arms your Prowess caus'd to be redoubted, both in <HI>Flanders</HI> and wherever else the Honour of his Com∣mands carry'd you. I could say much more, but that your Modesty obliges me to silence. But to what purpose should I be multiplying
<PB REF="6"/> words, when your own Acti∣ons themselves sufficiently Proclaim the rest, as well as your Person, which alone attracts the Affection and Esteem of all that have the advantage to know those ex∣cellent Qualities with which God has endow'd your Lord∣ship; and of which I wish your Lordship a happy and long Enjoyment. Accept therefore I beseech your Lord∣ship this small Present as a Testimony of my Respect in the Quality of</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Had written in my time se∣veral Volumes upon seve∣ral Subjects, which after∣wards I threw into the Fire; as well for that they dislik'd me (for I am a very severe Censu∣rer of my own works,) as for that I did not think them proper for the Genius of the Age, more inclin'd to trifles than to serious things. Nevertheless I was mer∣ciful to the Memory of my Ad∣ventures, not so much for any
<PB REF="8"/> Esteem which I had of them, but that I might leave my Chil∣dren settl'd in a Foreign Coun∣try the Consolation of knowing whence they came, and by what Accident they happen'd to be born. Afterwards understanding by the Conversation which I had had with the Booksellers, that Books of Travels were agreeable to the Palates of most Readers, the Inclination which I have had all my life to be serviceable to Mankind, made me resolve to publish this small Part of mine, at least to give some few hours Divertisement to the Publick by reading them; with this Pro∣mise, that if this small Essay
<PB REF="8"/> find acceptance, they shall have the whole Journal entire. The Im∣pression was begun in <HI>French</HI> the last year; at what time finding my self oblig'd to return into the <HI>Levant,</HI> upon the occasion which I have hinted in the preceding Epistle, I desir'd the Printer to stop his Press till my return, be∣cause I desir'd to oversee it. In the mean time he had caus'd my Copy to be Translated into <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> which I view'd and found faithfully done. After which ha∣ving restor'd him his Translation to do what he pleas'd with it, he desir'd me to answer some Ob∣jections which had been made in my absence.</P>
<PB REF="9"/>
<P>In the first Place they will hardly believe the Shipwrack which I suffered in my Third year, nor the manner how I e∣scaped. Nevertheless there is no∣thing more certain than what I have said of it: besides other Circumstances, which I have o∣mitted which would seem yet more incredible. All the City of <HI>Lyons,</HI> which is the Place of my Nativity, was at that time fully possess'd of it; I was there lookt upon as another <HI>Mo∣ses.</HI> Neither am I so old, but that there are still Persons alive that can testifie the same.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> They will have <HI>Heliopo∣lis</HI> to have been in <HI>Aegypt;</HI> I
<PB REF="9"/> confess it; but that is not the <HI>Heliopolis</HI> I speak of. But as there are at this time several Cities of the same name; as <HI>Frankfort</HI> upon the <HI>Maine, Frankfort</HI> upon the <HI>Oder; Ly∣ons</HI> upon the <HI>Saone,</HI> and <HI>Ly∣on le Saulnier;</HI> or <HI>Lyons</HI> where the Saltpits are, besides <HI>Leiden</HI> which the <HI>Latins</HI> call <HI>Lugdunum</HI> also: <HI>Chalon</HI> up∣on the <HI>Saone,</HI> and <HI>Chalons</HI> upon the <HI>Marne; Valence</HI> in the <HI>Dauphinate,</HI> and <HI>Valence</HI> in <HI>Spain:</HI> Why must it be deny'd, but that besides <HI>Helio∣polis</HI> in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> there may be that other of which I have given the Relation in <HI>Tartary.</HI> They
<PB REF="10"/> who never saw more than their own Village, never imagin that Steeples are of any other fashion than their own. <HI>Lactantius</HI> and St. <HI>Austin</HI> laught at those who by the dictates of sound sence af∣firm'd there were <HI>Antipodes.</HI> And a <HI>German</HI> Bishop was ac∣cus'd for a Heretick before Pope <HI>Zachary</HI> upon the same score. And if <HI>Columbus</HI> had not discover'd the way where o∣thers follow'd him, we should have had enow pitiful Schollars that would have maintain'd there was never any such thing. Be∣ing once in a Coach with an Im∣pertinent Lady, understanding that I was a <HI>French</HI> Man, she
<PB REF="10"/> would not believe that they spoke in <HI>France</HI> any other Language than hers, which she thought to be the Language of the whole World. Good God! how ma∣ny People are there, who be∣lieving themselves to be very witty, are altogether like this Woman? If not in this very par∣ticular, yet in several other things. We have taken for Fa∣bles what the Poets or the An∣cients have told us of the first Inhabitants of the World. That they liv'd after the manner of Beasts, without Commonwealths, without Laws, naked, and feed∣ing upon Acorns, and what the Earth produc'd, without any o∣ther
<PB REF="11"/> preparation than that of Nature. Yet they who return from <HI>America,</HI> tell us that they meet with such People there at this day, and that that part of the World is still in its In∣fancy. Nay though our own Hemisphear be so Polite, yet there are some Cantons disco∣ver'd, where the Men have only the outward shape of Men: Wit∣ness the Savage, which, as Monsieur <HI>Sloskoski</HI> a Canon of <HI>Cracovia,</HI> told me at <HI>Padua,</HI> he saw in his own Country, and which had been brought from the Mountains that separate <HI>Po∣land</HI> from <HI>Hungary.</HI> He was all over Hair, spoke not at all,
<PB REF="11"/> but made a sign for his Victu∣als, by barking like a Dog; he hid himself up in a Corner, a∣sham'd to be seen of Men; he refus'd all manner of Cloaths which they brought him, and the Bread and Meat which they offered him bak'd and boil'd; on∣ly fed upon raw Flesh and Pro∣vender like a Beast: For the ruggedness of those uninhabited Mountains hindring People of our Conditions to have any Con∣verse or Commerce in those Parts, preserves those Savages in their purely natural Estate; in like manner as the vast extent of the Ocean had kept the <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> in their Primitive simplicity.
<PB REF="12"/> Now because there was not any Author, who had inform'd the <HI>Polonians</HI> that there were Sa∣vages so near them, had they any reason to give the Lye to those, who having travell'd thi∣ther, either out of Curiosity, or by accident, should have assur'd them that it was so, unless they had brought one of those Savages along with them? which howe∣ver it was more easie for them to do than to bring a <HI>Heliopo∣litan</HI> into <HI>Europe.</HI> For of things which we do not see, we know nothing but by the Report of others. Now Men have not re∣ported to us all things for want of having been upon the Places;
<PB REF="12"/> and the Reason why they do not travel thither, is either want of Courage or Curiosity. Now that other People, besides those of whom History speaks, have transported themselves from one Country to another, there is no Question to be made: Witness those, who in the Times of the first <HI>Israelites</HI> escaped out of that part of <HI>Syria,</HI> where they inhabited, into <HI>Africa,</HI> where they Erected a Pillar, which was found several Ages after with this Inscription,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Procop. ci∣ted by <HI>Ma∣chiavel.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Nos Maurusii qui fugimus à facie Jo∣sue Latronis, filii Nave.</HI> 'Tis very well known, that we
<PB REF="13"/> have but a very small part of the Ancient Authors, and that those which have been preserv'd to us are very much maim'd. Had we all of them entire, we should not be such admirers of what appears to us so strange or new by reason of our Ignorance only. Perhaps we might there have found out the Transmigra∣tion of this Solary Colony, whe∣ther the Incredulous might easily go, since we do not here pretend to undertake the fantastick Tra∣vels of <HI>Begerac de Cyrano.</HI> As to what remains, since I relate nothing which is impossible or miraculous, or that may render my Relation incredulous, it
<PB REF="13"/> signifies little to call in question the Matter of Fact, while the possibility of the thing is acknow∣ledg'd; and that leaving to every one the liberty to believe as they please, they do not deprive me of that freedom which <HI>Plato</HI> had to propose the Idea of a Republick after his manner.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> As for the Passage where I say that I heard People speak∣ing Greek litteral behind a Wall, they exclaim'd it is impossible; but if they read with attention all the Relation, which in two different Passages says well enough for satisfying our Admirer, and I do not like Re∣petitions.</P>
<PB REF="14"/>
<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> They say that I have not given an exact Relation of my return. To which I answer, that being weari'd with long Travelling, I thought it sufficient to set down the most Remarkable things till I recover'd <HI>Turky.</HI> And as for what concerns <HI>Italy</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> I have not said any more concerning them going thither than coming back; tho' I have made very exact Descrip∣tions of them too, as well as of <HI>Ger∣many, Switzerland, Holland, Greece</HI> and other Countries, de∣scrib'd so many times by other Pens, and as well known to the <HI>English</HI> as <HI>England</HI> it self. However Courteous Reader, if
<PB REF="14"/> it be my good hap to understand that this Essay finds a favoura∣ble acceptance, I may observe the Promise which I have made you at the end of my Relation, by giving you the whole of my Adventures, together with the knowledge of all the Corners of the World, where I have been, as exactly as it is possible to be done.</P>

<HEAD>Monsieur <HI>L' EPY</HI>'s TRAVELS INTO <HI>TARTARY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SO glorious is the Beauty of the Sun, and the Sphere of his Activity so large, that of all those People who adore the Creature to the Prejudice and Dishonour of the Creator, those are to be deem'd less culpable, who pay their ho∣mage to this, of all the Beings or Things of Heaven which we behold, the most noble and beau∣tiful.
<PB N="2" REF="16"/> In short, his Characters have such a Correspondence with those of the Deity, that were it not for that Revelation which informs us to the contrary, we could not be blam'd for adoring him as the God of this subluna∣ry World. The Earth, which seems to undergo a kind of Death at his departure, seems to rise again at his return; while the Plants sending forth their Flowers and Leaves, recloath her with their gayest Ornaments. The Birds renew their Amours; the very Insects propagate; the more perfect Animals resume new vigor to engender their like: And, in a word, this com∣mon Mother of all things grows young again, when he has fi∣nished his Southern Retrograda∣tion, and comes back to us. Or,
<PB N="3" REF="16"/> if it be he that stands still, when she, according to the Or∣der of her Revolution, opposes against him one or other of his Tropicks. For then it is that she keeps open-house for all her Inhabitants, by the Production of her Fruits, by the Favour of his lovely Aspect, from which nothing is conceal'd. For the vast extent of his Beams renders him present over all the Universe, of which he penetrates the deep Abysses, there to produce Gold, Diamonds and Pearls. He is the inexhaustible Fountain of that heat which enlivens us, and our real Fellow-parent in the Generation of our Children, if we may give credit to <HI>Aristotle.</HI> He is lovely for his Beauty, to be adored for his Power, un∣speakable for his Effects, formi∣dable
<PB N="4" REF="17"/> for his Chastisements, which he shall quickly feel, that stares upon his lustre, with dis∣respectul Eyes, as being dazl'd with the sight; and if he con∣tinue obstinate in his curiosity, he fails not to find himself over∣whelmed with the spendor of his Glory. Now if all these Attributes will not serve to ex∣cuse People that want the light of the Sun of Justice, and that to be <HI>only</HI> a more specifick Cha∣racter of the Divinity, we may add in their favour, That he is only single; for which reason it was that the <HI>Greeks</HI> call'd him <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, by a name excluding Multitude. The <HI>Assyrians</HI> nam'd him <HI>Adad,</HI> signifying <HI>One,</HI> and acknowledged him for the chief∣est of the Gods, together with the <HI>Persians,</HI> who called him by
<PB N="5" REF="17"/> another name, which signifies in their Language, <HI>He in whom re∣sides the Soveraignty of Command.</HI> If <HI>Pliny</HI> his admirer did not adore him, he deem'd him wor∣thy the Adoration of the Peo∣ple, which the Inhabitants of the Fortunate Islands never re∣fus'd him. The <HI>Massagetes</HI> ac∣knowledge no other Deity but him. Also at this day we find in <HI>China</HI> a Temple dedicated to the Atoms of the Sun, whose Palace is thought to be the Pa∣radise of that People. All the Heathen upon the Coast of <HI>Ma∣labar</HI> pay him homage, as also some part of the <HI>Jappons,</HI> and the <HI>Great Tartars,</HI> as we are told by several Geographers. For my own part, in truth, I never observ'd any such sort of Worship in all that vast extent
<PB N="6" REF="18"/> of Territory, which I have tra∣vell'd; only I met with one small corner inhabited by Phi∣losophers originally descended from the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who mov'd by these, or some other more im∣portant Reflections, were con∣vinc'd not of his Divinity, but of his Superiority, and conse∣crated Holy-days; and ordain'd Ceremonies, wherein they ac∣knowledge the Benefits which they receive by his Influences. Their Form of Government is Aristocratical, under Laws that seem to have been borrowed from <HI>Plato</HI>'s Commonwealth, or else from the primitive Christi∣ans, as injoying all things in common, tho' it be not really so, as you shall see in reading these Travels, which I was in∣duced to undertake upon the following occasion.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="18"/>
<P>In the third year of my Age, and the year of our Lord 1636. I was sent by my Parents from a Country-house upon the <HI>Saone</HI> two Leagues above <HI>Lyons,</HI> with my Governess in a Boat, which through the carelessness of the Master, was overset by another larger Vessel that was tow'd a∣long the same River. I remem∣ber I heard the confused noise of Shrieks and crying-out, <HI>We are lost, we are lost;</HI> I ask'd what was the matter? they made an∣swer, That they believed me to be the Cause of their disaster, while the Boat-men stood ga∣zing to see me play in the Wa∣ter. At length I lost my senses, I know not how. But no sooner recovering my self, I saw a Lady floating upon the Water, that with a lamentable voice called
<PB N="8" REF="19"/> me by name; whereupon I cal∣led to her and others whom I saw perishing before my Eyes, to do as I did: For I fansied my self holding fast by the Piles of a wooden-Bridge, believing certainly that I could not be drowned so long as I kept my hold. Methought also that some body went about to hinder me from saving my self, by thrusting away my Head with a Pole, which made me call him Cruel. Being thus lost a second time, I remain'd senceless, till I found my self in a Bed, where some People had laid me, who per∣ceiving me from the shoar about half a League lower, and be∣lieving me to be a Bundle of Goods, came and fetch'd me out of the middle of the River, where they found me carried by
<PB N="9" REF="19"/> the Stream upon a Bavin of Vine-Twigs. About two hours after the Boat was sunk, where∣in were fourteen Persons all un∣fortunately drown'd. From that time forward, being at the dis∣posal of those to whom I was beholding for my life, I rowl'd from School to School, learn∣ing Greek, Latin, and Poetry, with whatever besides the Cir∣cle of the Sciences contains, till I was fourteen years of age; at what time being fallen into the hands of a sort of Persons, who have the subtilty to insinu∣ate themselves into the simple Minds of Youth, and to make what impression they please there∣in, I suffer'd my self to be led by their perswasions to follow their Maxims. I remain'd in their So∣ciety travelling from City to
<PB N="10" REF="20"/> City, from Country to Country, till I was four and twenty years of Age; at what time finding my self at <HI>Rome</HI> in full leisure to examine the Sciences, which I thought I had acquir'd, I found by my self, that I knew nothing because I had been ill taught: Therefore I translated my self from the <HI>Lycaeum</HI> to the <HI>Portico,</HI> to the end I might give my self wholly up to the Study of Mo∣rality, till the Reflections which I made upon the several Objects that presented themselves to my Senses, furnish'd me with other Principles, that made me apply my self to the study of Philoso∣phy and Physick, with a greater satisfaction than before.</P>
<P>During this leisure of mine, I open'd my Eyes to observe the Cheats that had been put upon
<PB N="11" REF="20"/> me, and bethought my self that it was my duty to abandon those People, whose ill lead Lives gave the Lye so manifest∣ly to their Tenents. There ha∣ving communicated my Design to <HI>Monthreso,</HI> the honestest and the most Learned among the whole Tribe, he not only ap∣prov'd it, but desir'd he might have the honour to accompany me in so laudable an Enter∣prize. With these Resolutions we departed from the Capi∣tal of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire the Twentieth of <HI>January</HI> 1663. by St. <HI>John Lateran</HI>'s Gate, and arrive at <HI>Naples</HI> by the 25th. where after we had seen the Curiosities of <HI>Puzzuolo,</HI> and <HI>Vesuvius,</HI> tir'd with our Tra∣vels through the Principal Parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> we resolv'd to see
<PB N="12" REF="21"/> the Varieties of other Coun∣tries and Territories of the World. Thereupon resolving to go aboard the first Vessel that set sail for the <HI>Levant,</HI> we went to the Sea-side, where we met with <HI>Signor Hippolito,</HI> Cap∣tain of the good Ship call'd the <HI>Hope;</HI> who understanding our design, made us an obliging Proffer of his Service, which we readily accepting, embark'd the fourth of <HI>February,</HI> with a Wind so favourable, that in a short time we lost sight of the Land, which by Sickness laying in my Cabin I saw no more till we arriv'd at <HI>Porto Lione,</HI> where we again had a view of it the Fifteenth. Overjoy'd that I was so near a Place which was formerly the Mansion of all Hu∣man Wisdom, I soon forgot the
<PB N="13" REF="21"/> tiresome hardships of the Sea. So soon as I cast my Eyes upon the ancient <HI>Pyraeum,</HI> so ill treat∣ed by Time, that it does not preserve so much as its Name, chang'd into that which it car∣ries at present, by reason of the ill-shap'd figure of a Lyon. In the same Place we hir'd Post-Horses to visit <HI>Athens,</HI> distant from the Port about five Miles. So soon as I arriv'd there, I be∣gan to look for the rugged Ruins of that Famous Piece of Antiquity. Wherein I found great Assistance from the know∣ledge of the Learned <HI>Demetri∣us,</HI> to whom I was recommend∣ed by his Friends at <HI>Venice.</HI> Nei∣ther was my own Skill in the Greek unprofitable to me. For though the Vulgar Greek differs very little from that in the
<PB N="14" REF="22"/> Schools, the Corruption of this is not so great, but that it may be understood, when it is spo∣ken according to the Pronuncia∣tion of the Country. Besides that it is as common among Persons of Quality, as Latin among the <HI>Polonians.</HI> Moreo∣ver, they told me, that there is no other Greek to speak pro∣perly than that. In regard that what is call'd Vulgar Greek is a kind of Pedlars French, which differs according to the several Jurisdictions of the Country: that it was the same in the time of <HI>Demosthenes;</HI> that then, be∣sides the four Dialects most known, there were some other in use among the Vulgar Peo∣ple; but that the Orators in their publick Pleadings made use of the common Speech,
<PB N="15" REF="22"/> which was understood by the ordinary sort, although they did not speak it; which they con∣firm'd to me by the Letters of private Persons written at that time, and which were after∣wards found in the Ruins of old Walls. Their Books also were written in that sort of Greek, which we call for that Reason <HI>Literal,</HI> and which is the very same that the Preachers at this day make use of in their Sermons. In a word that Per∣son is deem'd to write and speak best among them, who comes nearest the Language of the Ancient Authors; which is at this day the only Standard of the Language, as the <HI>Paragon</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> and the <HI>Parisian</HI> in <HI>France</HI> in respect of the other Provin∣ces, where though it be not
<PB N="16" REF="23"/> spoken, yet it is understood by the meaner sort. The Citadel or <HI>Acropolis</HI> seated upon a Rock commands the City, and is seen at Sea. Being not permitted to go in I could see no more than the outward side of it; but my Friend told me that there was a noble Piece of Antiquity, <HI>viz.</HI> the Temple of <HI>Diana.</HI> How∣ever all that we could meet with of the Ancient Ornaments of that City, built many Ages be∣fore <HI>Rome</HI> was, only certain small Towers erected in honour of those who had been Victors in the <HI>Olympick</HI> Games, and some Portico's of ruin'd Tem∣ples; among which there is one which resembles that of <HI>Virile Fortune,</HI> which is now the <HI>E∣gyptian</HI> St. <HI>Mary's</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> up∣on the Banks of <HI>Tiber,</HI> in the
<PB N="17" REF="23"/> Flesh-market. They shew'd me also a certain piece of carv'd Work, representing <HI>Diana</HI> in her hunting Habit, attended in a Wood by her Nymphs. It was a wonderful Piece of Work∣manship, and the Inscription gave us to understand, that it was wrought by the hand of <HI>Phidias,</HI> having been digg'd, but a little before we came thi∣ther, out of the Ruins of the <HI>Areopagus;</HI> which does not now stand within the compass of the City, that is now reduc'd with∣in a lesser compass. They also shew'd me the place of the Tem∣ple or Altar Erected to the un∣known God. Several Statues are digg'd up out of the Earth every day, of which not one that I have seen comes near to those of <HI>Italy.</HI> Thereupon be∣ing
<PB N="18" REF="24"/> amaz'd to see so few Signs of its ancient Splendor, they made me answer, that I might see them in other Places, whi∣ther the War had transplanted them, or else Barter in Traffick. Indeed there was one Piece which I saw the last time I was at <HI>Venice,</HI> in the House of <HI>Sig∣nor Michele Peruli,</HI> an <HI>Athenian</HI> Merchant, which had been sent him as a Present, representing in <HI>Bass Relief,</HI> a young man stark naked, holding a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Or else a Horn-Owlet, for the word signifies the same.</NOTE> Jack-daw in his Right hand. The bot∣om of the Sculpture was adorn'd with a Palm-tree, upon the Trunk of which a certain kind of <HI>Beetle</HI> was engrav'd in a creeping Po∣sture. The Cornish comes forth as far as the Statue, and is raised
<PB N="19" REF="24"/> by two borders, between which at the Top these words are to be read in Greek Letters, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which some will therefore have to be the Son of the Great <HI>Demosthe∣nes.</HI> The Piece is good from the Belly downward; but the Head is not very extraordinary, and the left hand is broke off. Every Body knows that the Sta∣tue of <HI>Venus</HI> which formerly stood upon <HI>Mount Pincius</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> and is now to be seen in the Galleries of <HI>Florence,</HI> leave being given to the Grand Duke by the present Pope to remove it thither, was the Work of an <HI>Athe∣nian,</HI> whose name is en∣grav'd at the bottom of the Statue, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Kleome∣nes
<PB N="20" REF="25"/> the Son of Apollodorus an Athenian made this.</HI> A favour which the Dukes Predecessors could ne'er obtain, though from Popes of the same Family. So cautious they were of parting with any of the Ornaments of their City; whereas the present Pope suffers them to be daily ta∣ken away, notwithstanding all the grumbling of the <HI>Romans.</HI> So that all that remains at this day of the <HI>Athenian</HI> Antiquity is their Olive Trees and their Wit. These Olive Trees en∣compass it round, and are the chief Revenue of the <HI>Athenians.</HI> Their other Fruits are very Ex∣cellent, and it may be the best in the World. But as for the Inhabitants they are no less na∣turally Witty and Ingenious than ever; so that if they
<PB N="21" REF="25"/> were but well manur'd by Edu∣cation, they would prove as Good Poets, Orators, Philoso∣phers, Statuaries or other Ar∣tists whatever, as ever were known at the time when it flou∣rish'd in its highest Splendour. The Turks have the same re∣spect for them as the <HI>Romans</HI> had; who suffer them to live according to their own Laws, and to be govern'd by their own Magistrates, for the <HI>Grand Sig∣nior</HI> is contented only with send∣ing thither one of his Favourite Eunuchs, who receives the Duty impos'd, without farther con∣cerning himself with their Af∣fairs; besides that his Garrison is very inconsiderable. The Bishop is Judge of the Diffe∣rences between the Diocesans, who generally submit to his De∣termination
<PB N="22" REF="26"/> for fear of Ecclesi∣astical Censures. They trade into <HI>Italy</HI> with their Commodi∣ties, for which they receive in exchange Cloth, and all manner of Iron Tools. Their Women are handsome, and richly clad in their Garments embroider'd with Gold down to their very Shooes, which their Husbands, though poor, willingly let them have, for fear of a greater mis∣chief. The Citizens of Quality wear a long black robe with short Sleeves; but their Priests are habited much like the Mini∣sters of the <HI>English</HI> Church, on∣ly the Sleeve is not gathered in∣to Pleats: In the City they al∣ways wear upon their Heads a round Cap; but in the Country a flat Hat; which they call an <HI>Ischiodon,</HI> because it covers them
<PB N="23" REF="26"/> from the Sun; their Beds are Quilts laid down on the Sopsa, but some of them are furnish'd after our own fashion.</P>
<P>They believe the presence of Jesus Christ in the Sacrament; though the most Learned among them have acknowledg'd to me, that the Fathers never under∣stood what <HI>Transubstantiation</HI> meant. They say moreover that Christ is not there present in that manner which the <HI>Latins</HI> hold, when the Priest pronoun∣ces these Words, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>This is my Body;</HI> which they affirm to be purely Historical, but by virtue of the Prayer when he says, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Make this Bread the worthy Body of Christ.</HI> I observ'd that they ne∣ver kneel'd before the Sacra∣ment,
<PB N="24" REF="27"/> but only bow'd with their Shoulders to the Bread, as well before as after Consecrati∣on. The Liturgy being ended, the Priest invites the People to the Communion, if no body come, he eats the remainder upon a Table which stands at the side of the North Door.</P>
<P>As for the Sick, they commu∣nicate of the Bread and Wine Consecrated by the Bishop upon <HI>Maundy Thursday</HI> for the whole year. To which purpose they keep the Bread steep'd in the Wine, by the side of the Altar in a Cup-board without Light. I ask'd them, whither the Sa∣crament so preserv'd, did not putrifie; but they assur'd me, it did not.</P>
<P>The Bishops Miter is not cloven, but round, and all beset
<PB N="25" REF="27"/> with precious Stones. All the Bishops believe themselves to be equal as to the Function, but not as to the Sea, the Dignity of which exalts the one above the other, by virtue of an Institution purely Humane, and not Di∣vine.</P>
<P>They never stay till they are sick to receive the Sacrament of Extream Unction; but they re∣ceive it all every year in the ho∣ly Week, after this manner: Two Archbishops bless the Oil; afterwards the Archbishop of the Church being seated in his Chair, and five or six Priests in theirs, the People present themselves to be anointed, first by the Prelate, who holding a Wax Candle in his hand, dips the Cotten in the holy Oil, and then anoints the Forhead,
<PB N="26" REF="28"/> the Face, and Palm of the Hand; after which the same Person goes to the other Priests who do the same. They pray for the dead, whose Souls they believe remain in this World in expectation of the General day of Judgment; not admitting any parcicular Judgment.</P>
<P>They frequently perfume with Frankincense in their Ceremo∣nies, which are very decent, and fill the Soul with a sensible Devotion. I ask'd them the reason why they made such fre∣quent use of their Perfumes; to which they answer'd, That it was to admonish the People to send up their Prayers with the Perfume, which ascends toward Heaven. As to what remains, the Eastern Church glories in its Priority, which they assume
<PB N="27" REF="28"/> to themselves, and which is no more than Truth; neither do the <HI>Latins</HI> dispute the Point of Eldership. That which sur∣priz'd me was this, that they should preserve themselves un∣der the Tyranny of the <HI>Maho∣metans,</HI> who neither by their oppressive Impositions, nor fair Promises, could ever oblige the Eastern Christians to change the <HI>Gospel</HI> for the <HI>Alcoran.</HI> To which purpose I will impart to the Reader two Remarkable Passages, that happen'd about six years since; the one at <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI> that befel a young man between seventeen and eighteen years of Age, whose Name was <HI>Anthony,</HI> Learned for his Age in the Turkish Language above a∣ny, belov'd by every one for his Excellent Qualities, even of
<PB N="28" REF="29"/> the Turks themselves, who for that reason would fain have brought him over to the <HI>Maho∣metan</HI> Religion. To which purpose they shew'd him a lit∣tle Note to read, wherein were written, in <HI>Arabian,</HI> these words, <HI>I believe in God, and in Maho∣met his Apostle.</HI> So soon as he had read it, they saluted him as one of their Brethren, saying he was a Turk, as having made a Profession of their Religion by reading that Note. He deny'd it; upon which they carried him before a Judge who condemn'd him. From thence they hal'd him to the Grand <HI>Visier,</HI> who upon the Testimony of those wicked People who had so sur∣priz'd him, condemn'd him also to make profession of the Law, as being thereto oblig'd by his
<PB N="29" REF="29"/> reading. Upon his refusal they carried him to Prison, where for thirty days he endured most horrible torments; of which one among the rest was the thrusting of sharp Reeds be∣tween the Flesh and the Nails of his Fingers: After which he had his Head cut off, which the Embassador of <HI>France</HI> bought of the Executioner as a precious Relique.</P>
<P>The other, named <HI>Diamanti,</HI> aged about thirty years, and of a charming Beauty, was rowing naked in a Boat upon a River of <HI>Asia,</HI> with certain <HI>Turks,</HI> who mov'd with com∣passion that so lovely a Man should perish for want of em∣bracing their Religion, put a white Turbant upon his Head. Which done, he was used with
<PB N="30" REF="30"/> the same severity as <HI>Anthony</HI> was, after he had refused the chiefest Preferments in the Empire. But a <HI>Jacobin</HI> Monk, who was there at the same time, renouncing his Christianity, was the occasion of their recovering by his Aposta∣cy, what they had lost by the generous Constancy of <HI>Diaman∣ti.</HI> I could give a more ample Description of the Religion of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> but having done it in another place, I shall not study to enlarge this Volume.</P>
<P>Neither was <HI>Demetrius</HI> con∣tent to shew me what was with∣in the City, but extending his kindness, resolv'd to let me see what was without. To which purpose he invited me to take a walk with him to the Coun∣try-house of one <HI>Constantine</HI> his particular Friend, distant about
<PB N="31" REF="30"/> ten miles; which we resolv'd to walk according to the custom of the Country. We set out by day-break, and with great delight cross'd over several de∣licious Gardens and Fields plant∣ed with Olive-trees, promising our selves a most pleasant Jour∣ney, perceiving the Sun to rise upon the Lilies whiteness. But contrary to the Maxim of the Weather-wise we were deceived. For a black Cloud behind us be∣ing driven forward by a West wind, soon got under the Sun, and deprived us of the sight of that noble Planet. Presently the Sky became so dark that we could hardly discern one ano∣ther, which were the fore-run∣ners of a most dreadful Thun∣der; which, however, did not terrifie me so much as the Rain
<PB N="32" REF="31"/> that followed did me mischief. For besides that continuing all that day, it soak'd through my Shirt to my very Skin; the Fat Soil of the Fields through which we were to pass to get the nearest way, being dissolv'd, we sunk in the Mud up to our very Knees, so that we were forc'd every step we took to pull out our Legs with our Hands. This same Combat with the bad Weather and worse Way, tired me so much, that I was forced to make a stop. Ne∣vertheless I encourag'd <HI>Monthre∣sor</HI> to follow <HI>Demetrius;</HI> I bid them also drink and be merry, and take no notice of my indis∣position, telling them withal, That after I had rested my self upon the descent of a Turfy Bank, where I was laid down
<PB N="33" REF="31"/> through meer faintness, I would endeavour to overtake them the next day. After that, falling insensibly asleep, I knew not what became of them, till wak'd with the noise, I perceiv'd them upon two Camels followed by a Countryman who led a third, which carried me to the Friends House.</P>
<P><HI>Constantine</HI> treated us with that magnificence, that it was easie to see he had been adver∣tised of our coming. But having lost all my Strength and Spirits, not all the Delicacy of his Vi∣ands could force my languishing Appetite; so that the good Wine was all the Refreshment I could take that Evening. How∣ever I took some pleasure to see the Company fall on so heartily, sometimes casting my Eyes upon
<PB N="34" REF="32"/> a Lady that sate over-against me, young, handsome, and plump, yet one that eat no more than my self; which I wondered at the more, because I could not see any reason she had to be so tender-stomach'd, I observ'd al∣so, that she would be still staring upon me, and could read in her Eyes that I was not a person out of her Favour. However, Mo∣desty would not permit me to inform my self any farther, and my Indisposition was Excuse e∣nough for me to take leave of the Company, that I might re∣pair the Losses of my Strength by the Refreshment of a good Bed. After a short Nap, I ob∣serv'd <HI>Monthresor</HI> earnestly pee∣ping through the crevice of a Door that lead out of my Cham∣ber into another, and finding
<PB N="35" REF="32"/> by my stirring, that I was awake, he came to me, and made me put my Head out of Bed, and look through the same chink in∣to the next Chamber, where I saw a young man performing the Duty of a Chambermaid to the young Lady: But neither of us knew what the meaning of it was; thereupon I fell asleep again, and <HI>Monthresor</HI> went to bed. About midnight I was awaked again by the hard tread∣ing of some body in the Cham∣ber; at what time, putting by the Curtain of the Bed, which was of Cloth of Gold, I was strangely surprized to see the same young man in his Shirt, with a Scimiter drawn in his right Hand, and his Eyes spark∣ling like the light that glitter'd out of the Lanthorn which he
<PB N="36" REF="33"/> held in his left, with my own Night-cap. Nor was I less ter∣rified to see him in that po∣sture making toward <HI>Monthre∣sor</HI>'s Bed; which however, he presently left to come to mine; and so soon as he perceived my bare Head, which I thrust out from between the Curtains to see what was the matter; <HI>Oh! is it you,</HI> cry'd he? The noise which he made, wakned my Companion, and I at the same time leap'd out of my Bed stark naked as I was, having lain af∣ter the <HI>Italian</HI> manner, the bet∣ter to ease my self, snatch'd up my Cloak and wound it about my Arm to send off the Blows which the enraged young Fellow laid on without mercy. By this <HI>Monthresor</HI> coming to my as∣sistance, clasp'd the young man
<PB N="37" REF="33"/> about both his Arms, and stopp'd his Fury, which was as much as he could do, in regard we had both left our Swords in the place where we supp'd. Pre∣sently after the Lady coming out of her Chamber, made a hideous out-cry which raised all the House, and brought them into the Room; and <HI>Demetrius</HI> without any more to do, took my part. At which the Ag∣gressor began to vomit forth a∣gainst me all the Reproaches and ill Language that his Pas∣sion could invent, out of a false belief, that I had at∣tempted the Honour of his Si∣ster, shews my Cap to <HI>Constan∣tine,</HI> as being the most proper Judge of the Trespass which was supposed to have been com∣mitted in his House; and adds,
<PB N="38" REF="34"/> That having heard a noise in her Chamber, he hastned thither and found what I wanted, lying at her Beds feet. However, though the Presumption were very rational, <HI>Demetrius</HI> had a better opinion of me, as well in respect of his experience of my Conversation, and the Re∣commendations of his Friends in my behalf, and stifly maintain'd that I was a Person that scorn'd such a dishonourable Action. On the other side, the Lady who had thrown her self be∣tween her Brother and me, to stop his Fury, conjured him by her own Honour, not to be∣lieve any thing that might tend to her Scandal; alledging, that the Cap might have been carried into the Chamber by some un∣thought-of Accident. This <HI>Con∣stantine</HI>
<PB N="39" REF="34"/> confirm'd, assuring the Company, That the Rats, of which the House was full for want of Cats, the sight of which he could not endure, did often play him such Tricks, many times carrying away his Stock∣ings and other Clothes, some∣times into one Corner, some∣times into another, and that so my Cap might have fallen ac∣cidentally from my Head, and have been carried where the young man found it; therefore he desired <HI>Lascaris</HI> to pacifie his Wrath, and me to pardon his zealous Fury in his Sister's behalf. Thereupon, every one acquiescing in his Judgment, they all return'd to their Beds. By break of day my Enemy gave me another visit, not like a Mad-man, but with a serene
<PB N="40" REF="35"/> and smiling Countenance, crav'd my Excuse for the Transports of his Rage; and so saying, he brought me one of his own Shooes that a Rat had likewise carried away, all gnaw'd and Vermin-eaten as it was: And this, added he, puts me out of doubt of <HI>Constantine</HI>'s Conje∣cture. After that he made me privy to his Sister's Concerns, and his design to carry her pri∣vately out of the way, that he might release her from the im∣portunate Addresses of the Eunuch Governour of <HI>Athens,</HI> who was passionately in love with her, but whose vain and impotent Caresses were loath∣some to her.</P>
<P><HI>Demetrius</HI> would fain have had me travelled farther up in∣to the Country; but in regard I
<PB N="41" REF="35"/> had seen enough to judge of the Nature of the rest by what I had seen already, that is to say, That it was enriched with ex∣cellent Fruits, abounding in Corn and Oil, without any de∣ficiency of <HI>Bacchus</HI>'s Liquor, I determined to return to the City, where finding my Land∣lord <HI>Epiphanes</HI> tied Legs and Feet by the Fetters of that Di∣stemper which proceeds from Wine and good Chear, where men indulge their Appetites to excess, I relieved him with my <HI>Antipodagricon,</HI> or Antidote a∣gainst the Gout; and under∣standing that our Vessel was ready to set sail for <HI>Constanti∣nople,</HI> tho' there still remained many things for me to have seen in this so highly renowned Pro∣vince of <HI>Greece;</HI> I rather chose
<PB N="42" REF="36"/> to deferr the Satisfaction of my Curiosity till my Return, than to lose the opportunity of our Vessel; so that we embark'd the 25th. New-stile, and the 15th. Old-stile, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> re∣tain as well as the <HI>English.</HI></P>
<P>Scarce were we got clear of the Road, but my usual Distem∣per seized me, which obliged me to keep my Cabin, where I lay ill till we came to <HI>Byzan∣tium,</HI> where we arrived the 4th. of <HI>March.</HI> Upon our landing, a <HI>French</HI> Slave that stood upon the Key, offered to conduct us to the House of <HI>Signior Lorenzo,</HI> to whom I had Letters to deli∣ver; by the way we met with two <HI>Turks,</HI> one of which took off my Hat, and with his Foot tossed it up into the Air, like a Foot-ball, diverting himself and
<PB N="43" REF="36"/> his Companion for some time with his rude Sport, laughing and houting all the while. The rea∣son was, as our Guide told us, because those sort of People bear an inveterate hatred to our Habits, which they look upon to be very paltry and ridiculous, nevertheless we think them to be very graceful, and account our selves the wisest People in the World.</P>
<P>This Capital City of the <HI>Ot∣toman</HI> Empire having been se∣veral times described by other Travellers who have been very exact in their relations, I shall say nothing of it, only that af∣ter I had satisfied my self with the sight of the Hippodrome, and several other the most re∣markable parts of it, I departed thence the 7th. of <HI>March,</HI> ha∣ving
<PB N="44" REF="37"/> the opportunity of a Ves∣sel, which carried me through the Euxine Sea to <HI>Lonati,</HI> where we arrived the 17th. my desire to see <HI>Tartary,</HI> of which Coun∣try there has been so little said, causing me to make choice of that Passage. However, not ha∣ving any information that might assist me to find out the most commodious and safest way to steer my Travels, I made it my business to frequent the Coffee-Houses, where I had the good luck to meet with <HI>Aristides,</HI> a young man, well-featur'd, and infinitely civil, the Son of a rich Merchant of <HI>Jamina</HI> in <HI>Epirus,</HI> famous for the Birth of <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> and well stored with Learning. This Person was also a Traveller for his pleasure, and with the same design that we had, which
<PB N="45" REF="37"/> was to see the most remote Pla∣ces, rarely frequented, and of which the Relations are hitherto very imperfect. He understood the Turkish perfectly well, but excell'd in the Litteral Greek. Seeing therefore that I had a smattering of both the Lan∣guages, and that our humours corresponded, he was desirous to make a Third in our Socie∣ty. Thereupon we concluded to range the remainder of Tur∣ky, being inform'd that we should find Vessels at <HI>Santa Ma∣ria,</HI> which would transport us into <HI>Tartary</HI> through the <HI>Caspian</HI> Sea, and that we might take that way without any danger, having a Janizary to attend us, with whom we might agree for the whole expence of the Jour∣ney. With these Instructions
<PB N="46" REF="38"/> we pitch'd upon a Rough hewn Blade, who undertook to conduct us for Twenty five Crowns a Head, for whose Fi∣delity, besides that he lookt like an honest stout fellow, a Mer∣chant of <HI>Aristides's</HI> Acquaintance engag'd. A Crown is a <HI>Spanish</HI> Real, which Money, as well as that of the <HI>German</HI> Empire and <HI>Holland,</HI> goes through all Turky with <HI>Venetian</HI> Sequins, to the great advantage of Travellers; upon every Sequin you get five Shillings, upon every Real one Shilling.</P>
<P>Upon the Twentieth of <HI>March</HI> we got a Horse-back, the Weather being very fair, and so continuing till the Thirti∣eth, at what time we got to <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> by easie Journeys, setting up our Tents in those
<PB N="47" REF="38"/> places which seem'd to us most convenient; and yet for all that we travell'd at least Twelve Leagues a day. All that Coun∣try which comprehends <HI>Mingre∣lia</HI> and <HI>Georgia,</HI> is sufficiently beautiful, but ill peopled and consequently worse manur'd. The <HI>Georgians</HI> are acompted Hereticks by the Greeks, though they observe their Ceremonies. The difference between them consists chiefly in this, that they will not acknowledge the Holy Virgin to be the Mother of God; alleadging that God could have no Mother: How∣ever though they blame the Greeks for being of a contrary Opinion, yet they do not for∣bear to frequent their Churches in <HI>Italy,</HI> and prefer them before the <HI>Latins. Aristides</HI> and my
<PB N="48" REF="39"/> self were present at their Cere∣monies in the Passion Week, at what time <HI>Monthresor</HI> lay sick of a Dysentry; but by virtue of an infallible Cure which I brought with me from <HI>Rome</HI> he recover'd, and was in a Condi∣tion to put to Sea, the Third of <HI>April,</HI> which we did with a fair Wind that brought us to <HI>Mora</HI> the Seventh. However we did not land there, by reason of the Pestilence that was very violent in that Place: Which was to me a grievous Affliction by rea∣son of the racking Pains which I endur'd upon the Sea, and which only going ashore could relieve. Thereupon we were constrain'd to put out again in∣to the open Sea, which being offended at our Return, began to murmur, and by and by all
<PB N="49" REF="39"/> in a raging fury began to threa∣ten the destruction of our Ves∣sel, and swallow us up in his Mounting Waves. Nor did the Storm cease till some hours after Night was shut in; but then it became so calm and smooth that I felt some ease.</P>
<P>The next day being the Eighth I got upon the Deck, and descrying Land with a small Town about three Miles distant from the Shore, I propos'd to our Friends, that we might be row'd ashore in our Skiff, to which they agreed, and our Captain was no less willing, and in respect to <HI>Aristides,</HI> order'd the Seamen to carry our Luggage to the Town, which afterwards we found to be <HI>Sabatan.</HI> There we were curteously receiv'd by the Inhabitants, who caress'd us after an extraordinary manner,
<PB N="50" REF="40"/> and without any hopes of Pro∣fit, in regard there are no Inns in that place, as in <HI>France</HI> and other Countries of Europe; the Person that entertains you being satisfi'd with having per∣form'd a laudable Act of Hospi∣tality. Happy was he that could have us; and therefore to please more then one we divided our selves. However though we lodg'd in several Houses, we kept together all day long. They also recommended to our Service a <HI>Tartarian,</HI> who having liv'd among the <HI>Franks</HI> at <HI>Con∣stantinople,</HI> had learnt the <HI>Itali∣an</HI> Language; and therefore finding him inclin'd to serve us we accepted of him. And thus having recover'd our former health by rest and good feed∣ing, we set forwards again the Eleventh, without any other de∣sign,
<PB N="51" REF="40"/> than to travel at a venture in a Country that let us come where we would, we had what we aim'd at.</P>
<P>About a Mile from <HI>Sabatan</HI> we travell'd over a rising Ground, from whence we might take a view of the Country; and after we had for some time lookt as far as we could see, we chose the South East, as seeming the most pleasant, and so march'd on with <HI>Caraman</HI> our <HI>Tartar</HI> be∣fore us, carrying a Basket of Provisions, with a <HI>Partisan</HI> in his hand, and his Bow and Ar∣rows at his Back. We carry'd every one a Carbine in our hands, as well for sport as de∣fence, two Pistols in our Pock∣ets, and a Scimitar by our sides; and as for our Coats and Bags of Linnen for change, we
<PB N="52" REF="41"/> threw them upon a Horse which we had provided to serve us in time of necessity. Moreover <HI>Aristides</HI> had one more atten∣dant than any of the rest; a stout Mastiff, which he had bred up of a Whelp, fierce to all others but his Masters Friends; and which his Master had arm'd with a strange fan∣tastical Cap of Steel to defend him from the Claws and Fangs of Wild Beasts, which cove∣ring his head like the hollow half of a Pruen Stone, ended a little below his Nose, like the Horn of a Rinoceros, with a Point so sharp to be able to pierce a Bufolo's Skin. This Dogs Name was <HI>Pamphagos,</HI> in plain <HI>English All-devour.</HI> And thus accouter'd and pro∣vided we travell'd all that day till night without meeting any
<PB N="53" REF="41"/> Living thing; nor was the night less tedious to us for want of a good lodging.</P>
<P>The Twelfth, setting forward again betimes in the Morning, and we found by <HI>Caramans</HI> pace, that we had made a shift to find the way to our Mouths in the Dark. But when we had made a farther Breach in his Basket at Noon, he began to out-strip us so fast that we were forc'd to order him to keep behind. Toward Even∣ing we discover'd a Cottage made of Stone without Morter cover'd with Grass. Thereup∣on we desir'd <HI>All-devour</HI> to o∣pen his Mouth and speak to the Cottage, believing that upon his surly summons they that were within would make their appearance; but no answer be∣ing return'd, we conjectur'd it
<PB N="54" REF="42"/> to be as we found it, empty; and thereupon thought fit to take possession, not knowing where to find a better Lodging. The rest of the Evening we spent in cutting Fern for our Bedding. The Wolves however being come, <HI>Monthresor</HI> strook a light with his steel and flint, to the end we might sup with more pleasure by the light of a small Wax Candle; <HI>Caraman</HI> was extreamly pleas'd to see us feed like Hunters, in hopes that he should have nothing to car∣ry next day; and truly there was but a very small Modicum left, which we reserv'd with an equal proportion of Wine for breakfast. Thus after we had supp'd we took our repose ve∣ry sweetly under the Guard of <HI>All-devour,</HI> who kept Sentinel at the Door of the Cottage.</P>
<PB N="55" REF="42"/>
<P>The Thirteenth <HI>All-devour</HI> started a Hare, which it was <HI>Monthresor</HI>'s good fortune to kill. Presently we got a good heap of Brush Wood together to roast our Venison. And af∣ter we had din'd we agreed to∣gether, that if any Misfortune should threaten us, the last li∣ving should inherit all the Goods.</P>
<P>All this while the apprehen∣sion of wanting Victuals had put us quite out of conceit with these Deserts, at what time we discover'd about four Miles off a rising Hillock, of which the White and Green put it into our heads that we should make a discovery what it really was. Thereupon we made up to it, and the nearer we approach'd the Objects rendring themselves more distinct, at length we per∣ceiv'd
<PB N="56" REF="43"/> them to be a knot of Shepherds Lodgings, who un∣derstanding by <HI>Caraman</HI> the Cause of our coming, feasted us in their Tents to the best of their Power: For their usual Dyet is Milk, Cheese, Butter and Pulse, such as the Earth naturally produces without la∣bour. Some there are that eat Flesh; but they are lookt upon as Savages and Brutes. They have also a sort of Wheat which grows like their Pulse without the assistance of Husbandry; but they make no Bread of it, no more than they make Wine of their Grapes. In a word, they live upon all the Productions of the Earth, which it affords them without any o∣ther preparation than that of nature. Nevertheless, as having the forecast of Bees and Emets,
<PB N="57" REF="43"/> they make their Provision in its proper Seasons against Win∣ter.</P>
<P>As to their Stature, they are generally about four foot and a half high, but never exceed five. Their Faces are generally square, but well shap'd, only that their Noses are generally flat: They are strong and couragious; their Cloathing for the more careless sort is only a Sheeps Skin; but the more neat and curious make use of the Skins of Hares, Martins, Foxes or Ty∣gers, which they kill in Hunt∣ing. Nor is the Habit of the Women much different from that of the Men; for they say that the Beard is a sufficient di∣stinction between the two Sexes. They are faithful to their Hus∣bands, equally sharing with them in their Cares and Pains,
<PB N="58" REF="44"/> according to the practise of <HI>Hol∣land.</HI> When they have a mind to eat, their Provision is brought in an old <HI>Hart,</HI> or <HI>Elan</HI>'s Skin; which being spread upon the Ground serves instead of a Ta∣ble, Napkin and Platter much like the Greeks and Turks; they sit down upon Cushions made of Sheep Skins with the Wooll on; every one takes what best pleases his Palate. For they have Fruits of all sorts, fresh in their Season, and pre∣serv'd in Winter; Apples, Pears, Cherries, Figs, Grapes, Wheat, Milk, and Roots, which they preserve in Honey instead of Salt, of which they make no use at all; they begin their Meals with a large draught of Milk, and so conclude them. After that, if they chance to be a drye, they quench their Thirsts
<PB N="59" REF="44"/> with the next fair Water they meet. They lye in their Cloaths upon Skins spread upon the Ground, and cover themselves with Skins of the same sort: Which I find to be more con∣venient than the Beds of <HI>Ger∣many</HI> and <HI>Switzerland,</HI> where Feathers serve for Bed and Co∣verlet.</P>
<P>They are never sick, and therefore Physick is not known among them. They only dye of old Age, upon the utter ex∣tinction of their Natural heat, which happens sooner or later, according to the Composition which they first receiv'd in their Mothers Womb. I once askt a decrepid old Man, whether he were not afraid of Death? Who being surpriz'd at the Novelty of a Question never propos'd a∣mong them, made answer, That
<PB N="60" REF="45"/> there was nothing to be fear'd where there was nothing of E∣vil. That he conceiv'd Death to be nothing else but a Cessati∣on from the Motions of Action and Thought: That all evil consisted in the Thought, and therefore there could be no suf∣fering where there is a Cessation of Thought. I could not but admire at such Philosophy as this in a Person so Illiterate; for they are so far from addicting themselves to study, that they have not any knowledge of Books. In the next place I caus'd him to be ask'd of what Religion he was? To which he made this Return, That he was a Shepherd by Profession; nor could I draw any other answer from him. They abide in the Places of which they make choice, so long as their Flocks
<PB N="61" REF="45"/> find any thing to feed upon. Afterwards they remove into o∣ther Parts, under the Conduct of one who is their Chief. They were so Civil, that perceiving we wanted a Tent, they pre∣sented us with one of their own; together with a Cart and four Cows to draw it, which be∣sides the service that they did us, might also feed us with their Milk. Their Tents are made of white Skins, drest with the Hair on; which colour they make choice of above all others, to the end their Tents may be discern'd at a distance, which prevents others that have occa∣sion to change their stations, to remove to a place already pos∣sess'd.</P>
<P>The Fifteenth we took leave of our Hosts, laden with Pro∣visions for Eight days, which
<PB N="62" REF="46"/> they put into our Cart; for which we presented them with several <HI>Italian</HI> Trifles, very ac∣ceptable to them by reason of their Novelty.</P>
<P>From thence we went on slowly, and by short Journeys, taking up our Lodging an hour before Night, which we spent either in eating or sleeping, one of our Company always keep∣ing watch in his Turn; not for fear of Robbers, or Barbarous spoilers of Passengers; for there are no such Usages among them, but for fear of the wild Beasts, which otherwise might have as∣saulted our Persons, or de∣vour'd our Cows, for whose Pasturage our Sentinel had in charge to provide, with the as∣sistance of <HI>All-devour,</HI> We al∣so made a stop in the day time, as well to rest our selves, as to
<PB N="63" REF="46"/> refresh our selves with a short Meal, which was generally by the side of a Fountain, which wanting of, we drank at the charge of our Cows.</P>
<P>The Twentieth we under∣stood by the heat of the Sun, that we were far distant from the North; which heat was so violent, that the Reflection of it from a Rock upon our right hand, put <HI>Aristides</HI> into a violent Fit of the Headach, who having at length met with a convenient Shade, under the favour of the Elbow of a Hillock, made bold to sit down upon certain Stones, which long time had loosen'd and rowl'd down from the Rock; besides that our hour be∣ing come, the conveniency of the Place invited us to take our Repast, provided we could meet with any Water. There∣upon
<PB N="64" REF="47"/> <HI>Monthresor</HI> and my self, leaving our sick Friend to his Repose under the Guard of <HI>Car∣raman,</HI> went to look out for some Water, judging by the na∣ture of the Place, that we could not be far off from a Spring: Nor were we deceiv'd, for not far off, we discovered a large Hind going to cool himself in a wide receptacle of spring water, not unlike to that which proves the Spring of a wide River near the Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> at the foot of <HI>Tourmagne</HI> at <HI>Nimes</HI> in <HI>Languedoc.</HI></P>
<P>The Beast was nothing scared either at the sight of us, or our Fire-arms; nor did we think it Humanity to injure our Benefa∣ctress. But finding the Rock to open in that place, our Curio∣sity led us to enter the Hole; wherein about ten paces from
<PB N="65" REF="47"/> the entrance, we found a spa∣cious Hall very convenient for us to take the benefit of the cool Air. The rocky part was so odly contrived, that you would have taken it for the Workman∣ship of a Monk of <HI>Pic-Puz,</HI> had you been near <HI>Paris.</HI> The bottom of the Grotto was cleft into an Ascent, the first steps of which did not seem very un∣easie. Thereupon our Curiosi∣ty leading us further, <HI>Monthre∣sor</HI> strook a light, by vertue of which we pursued the Ascent for about half a quarter of an Hour with some difficulty, till at length we came to another Hall larger and fairer than that below. Thence we passed into a Gallery that led into several others, very much resembling those of <HI>Chinon;</HI> for that here as well as there, the moisture of
<PB N="66" REF="48"/> the Earth straining it self through her Veins in so many distinct, as it were, Springs of Water, trans∣forms it self into so many Chry∣stal Pendants, sticking and cru∣sted to the Wall, like so many little Mirrours, in a concave and unequal form, not inferiour to the Ice flakes of <HI>Murrhan,</HI> which are polish'd at <HI>Venice.</HI> And thus Nature having, as it were in Sport, shewn us what she can do alone without the As∣sistance of Art, seem'd to teach us the Original of Rivers: For she permits the remainder of this matter, after she has form'd these rare Pieces of Workman∣ship, to fall partly by way of Di∣stillation from the point of a con∣fus'd multitude of Pyramids, hanging athwart this so richly frettiz'd Ceiling, partly trickling from the glittering Concave up∣on
<PB N="67" REF="48"/> the Pavement that receives it; whence the whole conveys it self into several Channels to be thence conducted into larger Receptacles, situated at a di∣stance one from another, till it come to the last and largest of all, whence it unfolds it self like a Napkin, which the violence of the Air opens as it hangs, till at length it descends in a kind of small Rain, colour'd by the Reflection of the Sun that shoots in through the hole at the top, into a profound Abyss, not to be beheld without Terror and Amazement. These Observati∣ons put me out of doubt, that that same Water which I knew to be a ramassment of distilled Drops, was the Water that ori∣ginally enlarg'd the Receptacle first mentioned, and to the Ri∣ver that springs from it. Whence
<PB N="68" REF="49"/> I concluded that all other Springs have the same original; whe∣ther it be, that the Air condens'd by Cold, dissolve into moisture; or whether the Earth imbibe this Humour by filtration, or otherwise, as I set forth in my new System of Philosophy. And thus satisfied with a sight so ex∣traordinary, we return'd to <HI>Ari∣stides,</HI> to whom we imparted our Discoveries; who thereup∣on would needs have us carry our Dinner thither, to the end we might have the pleasure of eating in such a delicious Ban∣quetting house.</P>
<P>The 21st. we had nothing but Plains on every side very rich in Pasturage, which was the rea∣son that we met several Shep∣herds who had left their Tents, where only Night requires their Attendance.</P>
<PB N="69" REF="49"/>
<P>The 23d. we arrived at the foot of a Mountain cover'd with Box, out of which the Lake called the Swan's Lake, dischar∣ges it self through a hole about ten foot below the top, among the Boughs of a pleasant Wood; where Nature has so ordered the sloping of the Rock, that some∣times the Water spouts forth like so many Waves, sometimes spurts out like a Plume of Feathers, and sometimes like an Agret; afterwards falling all of a sud∣den, like a Veil, through the sides of a Demi-oval, eight Foot in Diameter, it throws it self into a neighbouring River, which in Summer is the de∣light of the Shepherds that feed their Flocks in the Mea∣dows which it waters. In this River while they wash their Sheep, they sport with their
<PB N="70" REF="50"/> Sheperdesses; every one cocker∣ing and caressing his own Mi∣stress. Which done, they fall to their Musick, playing several Tunes upon Flutes made of the Rine of Willows that cover the Bank; upon which they also sit while they asswage the hun∣ger which their bathing has excited and sharpen'd, putting their own Victuals altogether. One day they gave us a Visit at our Imcampment, where we presented them with several Glass Jewels, such as they make at <HI>Nevers,</HI> in lieu of which, they brought us their Provisions, more than our Cart would carry.</P>
<P>The 24th. we came to a Fo∣rest, out of which there issued a Beast about the bigness of an Elephant, which it resembled in every thing else but the <HI>Probo∣scis.</HI> This Beast perceiving us,
<PB N="71" REF="50"/> recovered the Wood, where I could see him feed upon the ten∣der Branches of the Trees, not being able to nibble the Grass by reason of the tallness of his head. Thereupon judging it to be tame, I went up to it, and of∣fer'd it some Wheat in the Skirt of my Coat, which it swallow'd with some seeming acknow∣ledgment for my kindness, and kept us Company all the time we staid there under the shade of the Oakes.</P>
<P>The 25th. we made a full stop.</P>
<P>The 26th. being advertised by <HI>Caraman,</HI> that a Company of neighbouring Shepherds were packing up their Tents, with an intention to change their post, and that we should be very welcome in their Company; we accepted the Proposal, as well to continue our Journey with the
<PB N="72" REF="51"/> more convenience, as to observe the Form and Custom of their March, which is thus: The day before the Captain gives notice by the found of a Horn, that they are to be ready the next day. At what time the signal is no sooner given (so punctual they are) but they begin their March in this Order. First moves the Standard, which is the Head of Bull crowned with Flowers, which they stick upright in the Ground when there is any oc∣casion of encamping: After that follow the Pipers afoot; the Captain immediately goes be∣fore the Children which are car∣ried in Carts, with their Tutors, whose business it is to have an inspection into their Manners; next the Women and aged Peo∣ple carried likewise in Carts drawn by Bulls, for they have
<PB N="73" REF="51"/> no Oxen, neither is it their Cu∣stom to geld any other Creatures, detesting above all things that sort of Mutilation, so familiar among men in <HI>Italy,</HI> as injurious to Nature. After these follow the men in the full vigour of their years, together with the Baggage, the Guard of which belongs to them, and all the way they laugh and sing, and some∣times dance. Two hours before night they make a stop, at what time every Master of a Family carries what Provision is neces∣sary to his own People in the Carts. We followed them in our Cart till the 28. at what time we took our leaves, because they resolv'd to tarry, and we resolv'd to go farther.</P>
<P>The 29th. we met with se∣veral Huntsmen, who, as they told us, are another sort of wild
<PB N="74" REF="52"/> <HI>Tartars,</HI> who feed and cloath themselves with the Flesh and Skins of the Beasts which they take; and to that purpose making continual War upon the poor Creatures, with whom they combat, arm'd with a Bow and a Cutlace: Here we made a stop, and after Dinner had the satisfaction to see a Tyger pur∣sued by two of these Champions. So soon as they perceived the Beast, they presently let fly their Arrows against him, of which the first flight is not intended to do him any great harm, but on∣ly to provoke him the more. But when they perceive the Beast to make at them in revenge of the Injury, then they be∣stow their Arrows upon him thick and three-fold, till the poor Creature having received several Wounds in his Body, is
<PB N="75" REF="52"/> forc'd to yield. At what time one of the Hunters boldly rush∣ing in upon him, cuts off his Head with his Cutlace: Some∣times they will struggle with the Beast, but without any danger, for that they are very nimble, and never alone, otherwise the Beast would have the Advan∣tage.</P>
<P>The 30th. we passed through a Hamlet, where we desired Pro∣visions, which they let us have for our Money. Nevertheless, <HI>Monthresor</HI> finding himself in a Venison-Country, resolv'd to taste of it; to which purpose we made a stop about Noon, and after a short Repast, he be∣gan to beat the Fields, with <HI>Car∣raman</HI> in his Company, while <HI>Aristides</HI> and my self set up the Tent, and went to cut Wood for our Kitchen. Toward Eve∣ning
<PB N="76" REF="53"/> our Huntsmen returned loaden with Hares, Pheasants, and Partridges, which we roast∣ed upon a woodden-Spit, and feasted our selves that Night, if a Feast could be without Wine; but we were pretty well accu∣stomed by this time to want it. The first of <HI>May</HI> we set for∣ward betimes in the Morning, resolved for the future to make our best of the cool of the day, finding the heats to be very in∣commodious. But <HI>Monthresor</HI> allur'd with the Success he had the day before, was resolved to have the other Hunting-Bout together with his Companion, whom he never brought back again. For the poor <HI>Tartar</HI> was surprised by a <HI>Tyger,</HI> which leaping of a sudden upon him, gave him a gripe by the Neck, and choak'd him before his Master could
<PB N="77" REF="53"/> come to his relief, who neverthe∣less revenged his Death with his Scimitar, which he ran full into the Body of the Beast over gree∣dy of his Prey; with which Wound the <HI>Tyger</HI> died, only giving <HI>Monthresor</HI> a slight Nip in the Arm, which did not hin∣der the Victor however from fleaing him, that he might have the Spoils of his Enemy, which he preferred before those of an <HI>Aga.</HI></P>
<P>By this accident were we de∣prived of our Speech, as if all our three Tongues had been cut out, which caused us to bewail our Loss so much the more, be∣cause we thought it irreparable. We were now to renounce the Society of Men, unless we in∣tended only to appear among them as mute Beasts. However, we did not forbear to go for∣ward,
<PB N="78" REF="54"/> in hopes of some lucky Accident before we had spent all our Victuals, with which we were furnish'd for eight days; all which time we were continually upon the march, but when we either eat or slept, steering our course all along directly against the South-East, <HI>All-devour</HI> serving us in∣stead of a Forerunner, at∣tacquing with a Heroick Valour all that came in his way. But the most famous of his Exploits was this: A very fierce Lyon met him, and thought to have terrified him with his roaring; but <HI>All devour</HI> on the contrary growls, barks, advances, and having joyn'd him at four leaps, nimbly fixes upon his back, and presently made him sensible of the sharpness of his Fangs. There∣upon the Lyon endeavouring to shake off his Burden, frisk'd a∣bout
<PB N="79" REF="54"/> in such a manner, that he threw his Rider, and then flew open jaw'd upon his Antagonist with a design to gripe him by the Neck; but <HI>All-devour</HI> pre∣vented him; fixing his Steel∣horn so directly in the Palate of his Enemy, that he thrust it quite through and through. But then <HI>Aristides</HI> coming in seasonably to <HI>All devour</HI>'s relief, put an end to the Combat with his Scimitar, unwilling to hazard another en∣gagement.</P>
<P>The lovely clear Water that glided along by the side of a Wood whither we came the 6th. of <HI>May,</HI> invited us to make a stop. And here it was that <HI>Monthresor,</HI> notwithstanding the fatal Misfortune of <HI>Carraman,</HI> and all our friendly Perswasions to the contrary, would needs gratifie that extraordinary Pas∣sion
<PB N="80" REF="55"/> which he had for Hunting. Thereupon <HI>Aristides</HI> being re∣solv'd to keep him company, I was left alone to get ready the Lardings against their return: And I had the more hopes of his Success, in regard that <HI>All devour</HI> followed his Master. Nor had I been deceived, had they had none but Beasts to contend with; but a Destiny far different at∣tended <HI>Monthresor.</HI> For after they had rang'd about for some hours, they came to a Lake so clear and clean at the bottom, that it invited both, being heat∣ed by their Exercise, and scald∣ing heat of the Sun, to go into the Lake and bathe themselves. As for <HI>Aristides</HI> because he could not swim, he would not trust himself out of his depth, using only a medicinal Bath by the Banks of the Lake, while <HI>Mon∣thresor</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="55"/> diverted and pleased him∣self with cutting the smooth and liquid Plain through all its Di∣mensions. He tried its depth by diving to the bottom, its breadth and length in imitation of the Frog. Sometimes he laid himself upon his Back to ease himself; afterwards resuming the use of his Limbs with more vigor, with a design to cross the Lake, he met with a Current so rapid, that it carried him to the entrance of a Cavern hollowed under the Mountain that bor∣dred upon one side of the Lake, where he vanish'd of a sudden from <HI>Aristides</HI>'s sight, who made me the Relation with Tears in his Eyes for the Loss of a Person so dear to him. I spent the night in extremity of Sorrow, expect∣ing day-light, which no sooner appear'd, but I went and viewed
<PB N="82" REF="56"/> exactly the several Places, of which when I had consider'd all the Circumstances, I despair'd of ever seeing my Friend again.</P>
<P>The Eighth there arose such a furious Tempest, accompany'd with Rain and Thunder, as if the World had been returning to its first <HI>Chaos,</HI> and to com∣pleat my Miseries, I had the Misfortune to see <HI>Aristides</HI> ran∣vers'd to the Earth by a Flash of Lightning, and thrown four Paces at least before the Cart which I follow'd; I threw my self upon him for some time quite senceless; but then reco∣vering my self, I began to think that death had put an end to their Miseries, and that the end of my Friends Misfortunes was but the beginning of my own, in a strange Country, of which the Language and Roads were to
<PB N="83" REF="56"/> me unknown, without assist∣ance, without support, without Provisions or means of subsi∣stance. 'Tis true I had Gold and Jewels both of my own and of my deceas'd Companions; but I neither knew how to trade, nor how to agree with any Per∣son that could bring me to the Sea-side, where I might get a convenience to carry me back into my own Country; which I lookt upon as my best way. At last considering that I could get nothing by staying where I was, I resolv'd in the first place to pay my last devoires of Bu∣rial to my deceased Friend: To which purpose I made use of my Sword to dig a grave in the Earth four fingers deep, where I laid him at his full length, and cover'd him with the same Turf which I had par'd
<PB N="84" REF="57"/> off: For by our discourses to∣gether, I understood that such a Sepulcher pleas'd him best; for he did not like that Custom of the Christians to bury in Churches, who not content with a deep Grave, cover the dead Body with a heavy Free-stone. Whereas, said he, it is much better to carry our Carkases in∣to the Fields, where their sub∣stance dissolving, and serving to nourish the Plants, receives a kind of new Life; by which means the wrong done to Na∣ture by Mortality is in some mea∣sure repair'd. He also tax'd of sottishness and injustice the Cu∣stom of embalming; of sottish∣ness, because that Death re∣ceives no benefit by it: of in∣justice because it defrauds Na∣ture of her Rights; for 'tis her desire that the Corruption of
<PB N="85" REF="57"/> one should be attended by the Generation of another, to which Perfumes are an Enemy, be∣cause they delay the Dissolution of the Body which they embalme.</P>
<P>After all leaving <HI>All-devoure</HI> upon his Masters Grave, from whence I could by no means al∣lure him, I resolv'd to abandon my self to Fortune, and to the guidance of the Cows; which I determin'd should take their own fancy, without troubling my self any farther than only to follow them: In which distress, my Provisions failing me in three days, I was reduc'd to Milk; upon which I liv'd for three Weeks together, wandring through Deserts where I could not discern the least print of hu∣man Footstep. In the day time I took care to pick up all the Brush Wood and dry Sticks I could find
<PB N="86" REF="58"/> to make a Fire in the night, which I understood by the <HI>Tartars</HI> the wild Beasts would never ap∣proach. One time among the rest meditating like a Philoso∣pher, I came to a Lake, the deceitful Banks of which giving way to my Horses Feet, we fell both into the Water, which was of an ill taste, and began to fill my Mouth. Presently I threw my self off my Horse to∣ward the Land, and laid hold of the first Roots I could light up∣on, thinking to get up out of the Water, but they being too weak to bear my weight I fell in again; nor had I any other way to get out, but by grasping the Mudd, and so taking hold of other Roots stronger than the former, by which means I drew my self to the Shore. So full was I of my <HI>Seneca</HI> at that time;
<PB N="87" REF="58"/> and by reading him become so familiar with Death, that instead of being affrighted to see him so near me, I reason'd with my self in falling, with the same Tranquillity of mind as I could have done at the greatest dist∣ance from danger. My Horse had the Misfortune to remain there; but I the good for∣tune three days after to light in∣to a Country well manur'd. I saw that the Lands were till'd, and fenc'd with Diches as in Eu∣rope, that the Medows were Pa∣lizado'd, the Vinyards wall'd a∣bout, and a little farther I met with Gardens and Orchards plan∣ted according to Art. This change of the Scene put me in hopes that I should suddenly meet with Men of our own Fashions. And with these hopes I still went on, when by and by I came to a
<PB N="88" REF="59"/> place where I heard People talk on the orher side of a Wall. Upon which I made a stop, and listning understood their Lan∣guage to be <HI>Greek.</HI> What! thought I to my self, am I mira∣culously transported into <HI>Greece?</HI> Thereupon I went up into my Cart to see whither I could dis∣cover any thing like to what I had heard; and then I saw Peo∣ple weeding a Field that was sown with Corn, and planted with Vines after the manner of <HI>Naples.</HI> At first I took time to consider, not without astonish∣ment, that Persons who had no∣thing of a Country Meen, should employ themselves in Hus∣bandry. I rous'd my self, I felt my self, and yet could hardly believe my self, or rather I could not believe but that I dreamt, or that my Life had been only a
<PB N="89" REF="59"/> Dream, till this very Moment. However at length I opened my Lips and saluted the Gentlemen with a <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>God save ye.</HI> Thereupon they star'd upon me, and I ask'd them in what Coun∣try I was? In the Territories of <HI>Heliopolis,</HI> cry'd they, and you are welcome. Thereupon I made them a short Relation of my Misfortunes; upon which one of the Company by consent of the rest came to me, and un∣dertaking to drive my Cart, brought me to a Country House, about Five hunder'd Pa∣ces distant; where so soon as we came into the first Court, another took my Cows and led them to the Stable, while my Guide carry'd me into the House, the neatness of which, together with the Gaietry of the People charm'd me at first
<PB N="90" REF="60"/> sight; nor did they delay to bring me in Refreshments im∣mediately. Judge you whe∣ther I were not overjoy'd at a happiness so unexpected, and whether I did not with Pleasure behold the Wine in the Glasses, not having tasted any in so long time before. The Collation be∣ing ended, I was conducted in∣to a Chamber, where they told me I might take my Re∣pose at leisure, and make use of the Conveniencies of the Lodg∣ing as long as I pleas'd. There∣upon seeing the Bed handsom and decently adorn'd, as much weary as I was, I made haste in∣to it, and lay till the next morn∣ing very late.</P>
<P>In this delightful Mansion I spent three days, amidst the In∣nocent Sports of a most Charm∣ing Youthfulness, with which
<PB N="91" REF="60"/> they intermix'd the Labours of Country Husbandry, while the young Virgins and Lads met e∣very Evening to sing, dance, and play together at <HI>Colin-Mail∣lard</HI> or Blind-man's Buff; while such as were more seriously dis∣pos'd more seriously entertain'd each other. For they had all the Liberty to do what they pleas'd, in regard there were none that would abuse their Li∣berty; so vertuous were their Inclinations by the means of good Education, with which they were season'd in their ten∣der years. <HI>Callisthenes,</HI> the Master of the Society kept me Company continually; so that whether the Duty of his Office oblig'd him to go abroad, or whether he had a desire himself to take a walk, he would still have me to make one. So that
<PB N="92" REF="61"/> I had the leisure to inform my self touching the Original and Government of this Petty State; of which that Noble Gentleman gave me an Accompt, with that neatness which I am not able to imitate.</P>
<P>Sir, said he, since it is your intention to sojourn here for some time, and that you have laid your design to visit our Chief City. I will pass by seve∣ral things, which you will be a∣ble to observe of your self, con∣tenting my self to dispose your Mind to the understanding of what you shall see, by an exact Relation of our Establishment and Policy.</P>
<P>After the Death of <HI>Alexan∣der,</HI> his Courtiers shar'd his Em∣pire among themselves, and Go∣vern'd it after a manner so far from the Intentions of that
<PB N="93" REF="61"/> Prince, who always had a most particular esteem for Philo∣sophers, that they not able to endure the Tyranny of his Mi∣nisters, after a Consultation be∣coming their Wisdom, forsook <HI>Athens,</HI> carrying their Families along with them, to settle them∣selves in some part of the World, which they could find more Comodious for them, and there to live under Laws, of which themselves were the first Foun∣ders, and which we observe to this day. The rest of the Wise Men of <HI>Greece</HI> being inform'd of this design were desirous to be of the Company, and all toge∣ther carry along with them what they had of most precious Value, more especially the Books which you will see in the great Library at <HI>Heliopolis.</HI> Thus ha∣ving without danger cross'd the
<PB N="94" REF="62"/> Seas that separate us from our Ancient Country, so soon as they got a shore and saw the Land inhabited, they deem'd it a horrible attempt to expel the Inhabitants, only they desir'd free passage, which was granted them, and so they went forward, being resolv'd to make War up∣on none, unless thereto pro∣vok'd; nor to settle in any place to the prejudice of the Ancient Possessors, though they might have done it, as being sufficient∣ly numerous, and well provid∣ed with Arms. After they had wander'd two Years and two Months, at length they came to this Sunny Region, which when they found abandon'd, here they stopp'd, and satisfi'd themselves with the Fruits which they found growing here and there among the Plants, that Nature volunta∣rily
<PB N="95" REF="62"/> produc'd, the same upon which we live at this day; tho' perhaps somewhat bettter, through the Industry of our Progenitors, who grubb'd up the Lands, and in process of time brought them to that Per∣fection, wherein we still preserve them. They shared the pains and labour of Tillage one among another, every one according to his best Skill, making use of the Instruments and knowledge which they had brought along with them; some for planting Vinyards, others for sowing, o∣thers for forging the Smiths work, and others for building and Architecture. When they either cut or grubb'd up the Wood, they did not so destroy it, but that they reserv'd at con∣venient distances, enough for Firing, or for other uses; having
<PB N="96" REF="63"/> divided the Country, which in Diameter is Four hunder'd and fourscore Furlongs, which is Fifty nine <HI>English</HI> Miles, into as many Cantons and Country Seats, as it contains at this day. Afterwards they built a City in the very Navel of their Teritory, for the seat or residence of the Soul of this Mysterious Body, from the middle equally to in∣fluence all the Parts of its Cir∣cumference. This City they call'd <HI>Heliopolis</HI> in Honour of the Sun, which we believe to be the Center of the World, and the Heart from which those Spirits flow that enliven it. After that, they took into Consideration all the Forms of Government of which they had any knowledge, either by their own experience or by reading, and observing the defects of each, they thought
<PB N="97" REF="63"/> it more to the purpose to cull out of every one what they deem'd to be most profitable, taking the liberty to add or de∣minish, as they thought it most suitable for the Common Good, as aiming to Erect this their Bo∣dy of Government upon the Pat∣tern and Foundation of a Fami∣ly well order. To this purpose they agreed upon a General As∣sembly, where all the Men a∣bove thirty years should have a Right to vote: So that of twelve thousand Souls, which made up the whole Body, three thousand were privileg'd to be at the As∣sembly, partly Philosophers, part∣ly of other Professions who had run the same Risco, either for Affection or Interest. Out of these three they made choice of a thousand, to whom they sub∣mitted the Determination of all
<PB N="98" REF="64"/> their Concerns, having so great a Veneration for them, that they believ'd them Infallible. But afterwards considering that the number was too great, they chose rather to lose their share which they had in the Soveraign Government of a growing Re∣publick, than to expose it to Confusion, which usually hap∣pens, when a number too vast is therein concern'd. Thereupon they reduc'd their number to three hundred, to whom they surrender'd the whole Authority which had been surrender'd to them by the General Assembly. Which three hundred being con∣vinc'd of the necessity of a Pre∣sident or Chief, made choice of <HI>Misargyre,</HI> whom they invested with an Authority to make Laws, and to call together the Council for their Approbation. This Philo∣sopher,
<PB N="99" REF="64"/> not so much reverenc'd for his Age, as for the integrity of his manners, which was known to all the People, found little or no difficulty to establish what he thought most convenient; nor did he propose any thing but what was highly to be ap∣plauded. And therefore having summon'd a Council about eight days after, he thus deliver'd him∣self.</P>
<Q>Gentlemen, having retired both my self and my own Thoughts, that I might dis∣charge the Trust to me com∣mitted, instead of pursuing the usual Stratagem of Legislators, who were wont to feign Fami∣liarity with the Gods, thereby to oblige the People to a vene∣ration of their Laws, I have se∣riously examin'd the various Thoughts that turmoil'd my
<PB N="100" REF="65"/> mind, to make a choice of Con∣stitutions, and thereupon have reduc'd them all to one single Law, the only Law that ever I heard of in all my life, and which I believe to be under∣stood by all that are endued with a clear Understanding; and this is the Law of Nature, imprinted in our Hearts, con∣fess'd and acknowledged by all those who have not a Reason perverted and disordered by their Passions; and therefore to come to the Mark at which e∣very good Legislator chiefly ought to aim, that is to say, the maintaining of Peace a∣mong this People, who have willingly submitted themselves under our Conduct, I think it sufficient incessantly to admo∣nish them to follow the Lustre of that <HI>Flambeau</HI> which enligh∣tens
<PB N="101" REF="65"/> them to obey Reason, and above all the lovely Precept which that divine Mistress infu∣ses into the Breast of all Men. The Nature of man is his Reason. Does not she alone teach every particular man not to do to a∣nother what he would not have done to himself? Now this Command alone being pun∣ctually observ'd, is not this a∣lone sufficient to preserve peace among men? And therefore let it be sufficient for us to ordain, That the most prudent among us be oblig'd to undeceive all those, in whom false Mistakes and Prejudices have stifled the Sentiments which Nature in∣spires into us, for by this means we shall avoid multitude of Laws, and the Trash and Trum∣pery of Process that attends them. Now there is no need
<PB N="102" REF="66"/> of publishing this Law of our Reason, it is already within us: But in regard the Employments of Life, or our Passions veiling and clouding our Understand∣ings, hinder several from taking notice of it, my Opinion is to publish a Decree, That every Master of a Family have fairly written in large Characters, and in the most conspicuous part of his House these two words, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Follow Na∣ture,</HI> to the end that being al∣ways thus in view, it may be never out of their Memory. Let us also make another De∣cree, That our Children be well educated in pursuance of this Law. Let them be taught betimes, in the first place, that by it all Civil and Criminal Pro∣cesses ought to be determined, according to the Sentence of
<PB N="103" REF="66"/> those wise Men, with whom the Office and Dignity of the Magistracy is entrusted.</Q>
<P>Then having divided all the People into four distinct <HI>Classes,</HI> of Children to the Age of seven years; of Youths, till eighteen; of young Men, till thirty; and of Men in their perfection, from thirty to the end of their lives, he ordain'd that the first should remain purely under the tuition of their Parents, who besides their instructing them in good Manners, should also teach them to read: That from thence they should be sent to the several Schools, there to be instructed by Masters chosen by the <HI>Council,</HI> in the liberal Arts, in Military Discipline, and in Moral and Natural Philosophy: That such as should be deem'd uncapable of learning the Sciences, should
<PB N="104" REF="67"/> be put to Trades and Manufa∣ctures most suitable to their <HI>Ge∣nius</HI>'s; for certain it is, that Na∣ture, besides an inclination to Arts, furnishes us also with Fa∣culties necessary to attain those Arts. That being arriv'd to the Age of the third <HI>Classis,</HI> they should be sent to the Country-Houses, where after they had serv'd twelve years under the Directions of a Governour de∣puted by the <HI>Council,</HI> they should return to the City to be mar∣ried, and then to spend the rest of their days in Peace and Tran∣quility. That the young Vir∣gins also should be brought up in Schools apart, and instructed in Arts most suitable to their Sex, then sent into the Country for the Country husbanding, under the care of a Mistress who should be answerable for their Educa∣tion
<PB N="105" REF="67"/> to the Council; with this difference only, that they should serve no longer than only twen∣ty five years of age, and then to be sent home to their Parents to be married at their discretion, preferring before all, the Per∣sons to whom they shall have engag'd their Affections in the Country, whose Dispositions they have more reason to know than those of others whom they never saw in their lives.</P>
<P>Then considering that diffe∣rences among Citizens generally proceed from disputes about Property, it was ordain'd, That every thing should be in Com∣mon; and that there should be Magazines in several Quarters of the City; whence there should be a distribution made of all things necessary for Food and Rayment. They also enacted
<PB N="106" REF="68"/> several other Laws and Consti∣tutions, of which you will suffi∣ciently be inform'd if you make any stay among us.</P>
<P>He also propos'd to continue this number of three hundred, the members of which should be call'd <HI>Wise Men:</HI> That thirty of the most ancient of this number receiv'd, should be of the stand∣ing Council, to the Assistance of which the rest should be called upon extraordinary Occasions, when the thirty should think it expedient; and that these thirty should have for their President the most ancient among them, who should be also the chief Per∣son in the <HI>State;</HI> and that when one Place fell vacant, it should be fill'd up with the most ancient of the hundred and seventy, and his place should be supplied by one chosen by the <HI>Thirty.</HI></P>
<PB N="107" REF="68"/>
<P>All this was approved by the three hundred; and to the end these Constitutions might re∣main inviolable to perpetuity, as the fundamental Law of the Kingdom, they summon'd toge∣ther once more the General As∣sembly, who having heard these Constitutions read, subscrib'd them without the least Hesitati∣on, promising to observe and defend them with their lives; and unanimously pronouncing an <HI>Anathema</HI> upon all such as hereafter prove refractary and disobedient; that is to say, the Curse of Banishment, which is indeed the only Punishment that we inflict for the highest Crimes, and which we fear more than Death. So that of three of our Citizens that have been con∣demn'd in all since the first set∣tlement of our Commonwealth,
<PB N="108" REF="69"/> to this present time, there was not one but would have rather chosen to have been his own Exe∣cutioner, than to have been ex∣pell'd his Country by perpetual Banishment. <HI>Misangyres</HI> also pre∣sently gave testimony of the sin∣cerity of his Soul by his submis∣sion to those Ordinances which he had made; for that in regard he was not the most ancient of the Society, he surrendred his Presidentship to his Senior: but it was answer'd him, That as to that particular, the Law was not to take place till after his Death, and so oblig'd him to keep his Station. From that time for∣ward the <HI>Thirty</HI> have been So∣veraign Rulers in all affairs both private and publick. The rest are entrusted with the Superin∣tendency over the Tribes, and Inspection into the Schools, the
<PB N="109" REF="69"/> Manufactures and Magazines. They are also the first Judges of all differences that arise within the several Cantons where they dwell, from whom because they are look'd upon as they are, to be Persons of great Equity and In∣tegrity, you shall very rarely hear of any Appeals to the <HI>Thirty</HI> from their Determinations.</P>
<P>This Discourse gave me so great an <HI>Idea</HI> of the City, that I most earnestly desir'd him to vouchsafe me an occasion of see∣ing it with the first opportunity. Thereupon, to morrow, said he, I shall send away the Carts ac∣cording to order, by which means you will have the oppor∣tunity of going along with my Deputy, to whom I will give order to be your Guide, and to present you to the <HI>Wise-man</HI> of this Precinct, who will take care
<PB N="110" REF="70"/> of your person. These Waggons which are built much after the manner of <HI>Holland,</HI> are drawn by Bulls that bear the mark of the Country-house that sends them, and of the Tribe to which they belong; and after they have de∣liver'd their Provisions into the Magazines, they carry back what is contain'd in the Governour or <HI>Archon</HI>'s Note, for the Service of the Farm, together with such Parents as have a desire to see their Children, as also sick Per∣sons, to whom change of Air is prescribed for their recovery.</P>
<P>Having therefore taken leave of the <HI>Archon,</HI> whom I present∣ed with a Case of <HI>English</HI> Knives with Oriental Agate Handles em∣bellish'd with Gold; I took the first <HI>Waggon,</HI> and plac'd my self next to the Deputy, who drove the <HI>Waggon</HI> in a Seat covered
<PB N="111" REF="70"/> over, and large enough to hold three Persons with ease. The way, which is about five and twenty miles, or two hundred Furlongs, according to their mea∣sure, to me seem'd very short, as well through the learned Di∣scourse of the Waggoner, as for the Diversity of Objects which presented themselves to me in this enchanted Country. We baited at all the Country-houses upon the Road, and were treat∣ed with Dancing and Musick. There is not one navigable Ri∣ver in all the Country, but a great number of small Streams and Brooks, of which some have Water enough to turn their Corn-mills and Paper-mills. They have no high Mountains, but only some few Hillocks, fertile in Wine and Oil, which set forth the Beauty of the Plains, like
<PB N="112" REF="71"/> precious Stones enchas'd in Gold-smiths Work. The Soil yields fifteen for one, and the goodness of the Pasturage dis∣covers it self by the excellent taste of their meat.</P>
<P>The Philosopher caress'd me with more than ordinary Civili∣ty, and carried me to the <HI>Foreste∣ria,</HI> or Foreigner's Lodge, which is a House built at one of the ends of the Town adjoining to the Ma∣nufacturies and Schools, where strangers are entertain'd, and their Expences honourably de∣fray'd. The first two days, be∣sides the days of arrival and de∣parture, they feast very splen∣didly; but if the Stranger stays any longer, he is treated as a Ci∣tizen: Though to say the truth, they are not much troubled with Strangers, for very few travel thither, for that the <HI>Europeans,</HI>
<PB N="113" REF="71"/> who are the greatest Travellers in the World, have no know∣ledge of the place; either ima∣gining that there is nothing so beautiful in <HI>Tartary,</HI> or that the difficulties of travelling thither are unsurmountable. However, there was in the City when I was there, a <HI>Muscovite</HI> of <HI>Astra∣can,</HI> two <HI>Tartars</HI> and one <HI>Per∣sian,</HI> whom meer chance had brought thither as well as my self.</P>
<P>The Reports of my Arrival being spread among the Philoso∣phers, I never wanted Compa∣ny, which the rarity of the Acci∣dent brought to visit me. They told me that they had not seen in their City before sixty years together any of the third Part of the Continent which we in∣habit, and which they only know by means of the ancient Geogra∣phy,
<PB N="114" REF="72"/> but one; which Person was a <HI>Frenchman</HI> who died three Months after his Arrival, with a Surfeit of <HI>Champignons</HI> and new Wine, which he drank to excess, it being then Vintage-time. Up∣on that I told them, that I was likewise a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> which put them into a Laughter, because they said my Language spoke the contrary; for that as they said, they had in their Library a Book that they found in strip∣ping a deceas'd Pilgrim, wherein they saw nothing that resembl'd my speech. 'Tis true, Gentle∣men, said I, that in <HI>France</HI> they speak otherwise than I do, for I understand the <HI>Greek</HI> which I learn'd by my own endeavours, out of a natural inclination which I had for a Language that was formerly spoken by the most excellent People in the World.</P>
<PB N="115" REF="72"/>
<P>But of all that came to visit me at my first coming, Persons of Wit and and Learning, <HI>Eu∣genes</HI> was the Person toward whom my Affection most enclin'd, as being one whose humour I found to be most agreeable with mine. Thereupon I enter'd into a strict League of Friendship with him, so that whether at our Re∣creations or our Studies we never forsook each other. Which he might the more easily do, in re∣gard that being, by reason of his Youth, excluded from the ma∣nagement of publick Affairs, he was the more at leisure. So that he was my constant Guide, wherever my Curiosity led me.</P>
<P>In the first place he carry'd me to a Pillar built much like the Monument in <HI>London,</HI> but rising higher, from whence I could take a full view of the City. It is
<PB N="116" REF="73"/> seated in a Plain, water'd within and without with several Rivu∣lets of Running Water. The Houses are Low-built, all but the publick Buildings; which because they take up a larger ex∣tent of Ground than the private Houses, generally over look them. But none either pub∣lick or private are above two Stories high. The Figure of it is round, and it is about three good Miles in Diameter, without Walls, defended only by a single Moat, which is fed by the Ri∣vers that water it both within and without. From this high Pillar I had also a Prospect of all the pleasant Country round a∣bout in its most beautiful Trim; as also of the Country Houses scatter'd up and down at equal distances, like a Fleet of Ships upon the Ocean in a Calm, or
<PB N="117" REF="73"/> like so many Stars in the Firma∣ment in a serene Season. About Two hundred Miles from hence, they that have a very quick sight may discern a Chain of Mountains, which by reason of the vastness of the distance, seem to be embody'd with the Clouds themselves.</P>
<P>And thus having consider'd the City in general, we descend∣ed to view it in particular. It is divided into three Quarters or Wards, of which the first in the heart of the City, derives its name from the Sun, the second from the Council, and the third from the Schools. The Streets are wide, clean and streight, like those of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> but with∣out Trees; and instead of Fil∣thy Kennels it is stor'd with Ri∣vers that carry away the nasti∣ness of the Street, and all un∣cleanness
<PB N="118" REF="74"/> from the City. As well the <HI>Piazza's</HI> as the Streets are a∣dorn'd with Portico's like <HI>Bolig∣na,</HI> as neat and elegant as the Cloister of the <HI>Chartrena</HI> at <HI>Pa∣via.</HI> So that you may walk a∣bout your Business at all Seasons free from the annoyance of heat or rain. The Roof of these Portico's is supported by Pillars without, and Pilasters within (I mean adjoining to the Wall it self of the Houses) of the <HI>Do∣rick Order,</HI> in the Council Ward; of the <HI>Ionick Order</HI> in the Schools Ward; and of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> in the Ward of the Sun. The Doors and Windows observe the same Symmetry. The tops of their Houses are cover'd with Lead, in a Figure of a Duomo, ending with a Cuppola of Cop∣per all gilt over. The Gutters also being gilded are laid upon
<PB N="119" REF="74"/> a Balister of hard Stone, between the Windows of which they dis∣charge the Rain Water into the Rivulets underneath. Every House has a Garden belonging to it on the back side, with a Foun∣tain, causing a delicate Prospect at the Entrance. And both the Streets and Portico's are so order'd, that the back sides of the Houses face each other the Gardens lying between, only parted by a Rail, from on both sides there is a continual fall of clear Water from the Mouth of some Antick Figure or o∣ther.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Piazza of the Suns Ward, which is Six hundred Paces in Diameter, there stands a Structure like the <HI>Pantheon</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> with this ad∣dition that it is surrounded with a Portico, supported with Co∣lumns
<PB N="120" REF="75"/> of Porphyry, the Chapter and Bases of which are gilt. There are four entrances into it at four opposite Doors fronting the four Cardinal Points; and the coming to it is through as many Gutters leading to the Cir∣cumference of the Grand Portico of the Piazza. The Roof opens in the middle, as well to give light to that Pompous Enclosure, as to give vent to the Perfumes that are burnt therein. In the Body of the Wall under that part where the Roof begins to rise, are Three hundred and six∣ty round holes, answering to the Three hundred and sixty degrees of the Ecliptick, to mark out the Point of the Zodiack which the Sun touches every day above the Earth, which according to their Opinion moves and not the Sun, whom they will have
<PB N="121" REF="75"/> to be fix'd to the Center of the World. This vast <HI>Cupola</HI> is rear'd up into the Air with a double row of Alabaster Pillars, of the Order of the <HI>Caryatides;</HI> the workmanship most delicate, the Drapery of Gold, and the Base of the same, upon a Pedestal of Jasper. The Frize enrich'd with <HI>Releifs</HI> of Gold, having its <HI>Cor∣niche</HI> also of Alabaster, is sur∣mounted with a Balister of the same Metal. The Counter Pila∣sters of the <HI>Corridore</HI> are pro∣portionable to the beauty of the Columns, their hollow spaces be∣ing fill'd up with Serpentine, as is the whole Concavity of the Duomo with <HI>Lapis Lazuli,</HI> the most beautiful that ever I saw in the most curious Cabinets in <HI>Ita∣ly.</HI> From the Center of the Pave∣ment which is of Alabaster as white as Snow, rise three
<PB N="122" REF="76"/> round Steps of Steel, adorn'd with Arabick Figures of <HI>Re∣port,</HI> also of Gold, which frame the Base of a <HI>Tripos</HI> all of massy Gold, enchas'd with precious Stones, of which the upper most Figure, like an Eagles Head, bears a little Perfumer of Gold likewise, to which Rubies and Diamonds contribute such a Lu∣stre, as dazles the Eyes of the Beholder. The uppermost of the Steps publishes also the Magnifi∣cence of the Person, that present∣ed so rich a Jewel to the Repub∣lick, by this Inscription in Let∣ters of Gold, <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>The Gift of</HI> Chosores <HI>King of the Persians.</HI> The Circle of Gold that surrounds the O∣verture of the <HI>Duomo,</HI> spreads his Beams of the same Metal upon the lead that covers it without.</P>
<P>Astonish'd at so much Riches,
<PB N="123" REF="76"/> I could hardly believe my own Eyes. But my Guide gave me to understand that the Quarries that afforded the Marble which adorn'd this sumptuous Temple, were not far distant. And then considering with my self, that that same Luxury which ruins larger and more Potent States than this, was banish'd hence, I began to think, that in so many Ages they might have probably heap'd together so much Gold as I saw.</P>
<P>From thence I went to the Pi∣azza of the Schools, where stands a Fountain adorn'd with a larger Aigret than both those together in the <HI>Vatican:</HI> And the fall of the Water like Dew, is so artfully contriv'd, that the Beams of the Sun continually form in the drisling Rain the Daughter of <HI>Thaumantes.</HI></P>
<PB N="124" REF="77"/>
<P>The Piazza of the Council Ward was adorn'd with a more Magnificent Fountain represent∣ing the Celestial Sphear, support∣ed by a Column of Granate Stone; so conformable to the Systeme of <HI>Copernicus,</HI> that I be∣gan to think that some of his Fol∣lowers had communicated his de∣sign to these Philosophers; but they told me that the same Do∣ctrine had taken Root in their Schools above a thousand years before; and that as for <HI>Coperni∣cus</HI> they had never so much as heard of his Name. The Globe of the Sun, which makes the Cen∣ter from all the Points of its Convexity, casts an infinite num∣ber of watry Beams, with which it besprinkles the Earth; the Moon, withal the rest of the Planets, and all the Parts of the Spherical Concavity, whence the
<PB N="125" REF="77"/> same Beams descend like Rain into a Receptacle fashion'd like a Roman S or <HI>Oget</HI> in Architecture, made of a Stone so hard that they were twelve years before they could hollow and polish it.</P>
<P>In this <HI>Piazza</HI> live the Thirty, who assemble every Morning in the hall of the Grand Palace, ei∣ther to do Justice to particular Persons, or to consult about the publick Affairs. If the Presi∣dent be indispos'd, the most An∣cient next to him presides; and they Summon the Senior of the Two hunder'd and seventy to supply the number of the Thirty.</P>
<P>There are neither Proctors nor Notaries, nor Advocates to be seen in this Place, every one Pleads for himself. But if they find the Person to be uncapable to Plead for himself, he has li∣berty to bring a Philosopher,
<PB N="126" REF="78"/> who is his Friend, who does him that kindness gratis. I often frequented their Courts through pleasure, which I took in hearing the Polite Orations which are there spoken. For the stream of discourse is not interrupted with the irksom Citation of Law Cases, with which our Advocates stuff their Pleadings: They ha∣ving no other Law to study but that of Nature, instead of the Volums of <HI>Codes</HI> and <HI>Digests,</HI> they read themselves, and draw from their proper Fund the Ar∣guments by which they maintain the Right of their Cause, yet not without the flourishes and beauties of true Reasoning nei∣ther. Among the rest I was present at the Oration of a young Philo∣sopher upon a Fact, which merits the Relation by reason of the Ex∣travagancy of the Case.</P>
<PB N="127" REF="78"/>
<P><HI>Philaretes</HI> (for that was the young Philosophers Name) had made his own Caravan in the same Country House with <HI>Ʋrania,</HI> whose rare Beauty, ac∣company'd with her sweet and obliging humour had ren∣der'd him her absolute Ado∣rer. But he was not her only Admirer, for he had a Rival whose Name was <HI>Philip;</HI> and the strife was between these two who should gain this Incomparable fair one by the Assiduity of their Services, or who should give her the most undenyable Marks of his Passion. One day <HI>Philaretes</HI> being in the Fields, a Fire took hold of a Barn through which there was a necessity to pass to the Chamber where <HI>Ʋrania</HI> was crying out for help. Presently <HI>Philip</HI> ran to her assistance, dart∣ing through the Flames, which a
<PB N="128" REF="79"/> Fire more scorching, though in∣visible, would not suffer him to be sensible of. So soon as he was got to his Beloved, he threw off the rest of his Cloaths which he had sav'd from the Flames by his swiftness, and of them makes a long Twist, which he girt about her waste, and so letting her down through the Window threw himself after her. After that he lookt upon her as the purchase of his Merit; nor did she her self scruple to declare her self in favour of him who had so generously expos'd himself to save her Life. <HI>Philaretes</HI> how∣ever ceas'd not to continue his Courtship, extenuating the Gal∣lantry of his, and still speaking slightly of the danger to which he had expos'd himself for her sake.</P>
<P>Some time after <HI>Philip</HI> put two
<PB N="129" REF="79"/> young Colts into his Chariot on purpose to try them before <HI>Ʋra∣nia;</HI> to whom a Companion of hers being gain'd before hand by her Lover, made a proposal to get up into his Chariot and take the Air for a Mile or two, en∣gaging her self that care should be taken of the Sheep till their return. But they had not rid a∣bove four Furlongs, before the Colts, being frighted at the shade of an Oak, fell a running with such a fury, that all the Skill of their Driver could not stop them, so that <HI>Philip</HI> was con∣strain'd to leap out of his seat to take hold of the Reins, but he was too feeble to be their Master: insomuch that now obedient to nothing but the Impetuosity of their fury, they had already whirl'd the miserable <HI>Ʋrania</HI> within ten Paces of a dange∣rous
<PB N="130" REF="80"/> Precipice, which <HI>Philaretes</HI> perceiving, scotch'd the Wheel of the Wagon so luckily, that he had time to get before, and with his own Body to prevent the fu∣rious Animals from running any farther. By that means he de∣liver'd his Mistress from the dan∣ger, but it cost him the loss of his right Leg, which was so broke and mash'd, that there was no cure for it, but by the Amputa∣tion of the Member. That un∣fortunate Maim, which still pleaded in behalf of <HI>Philaretes,</HI> oblig'd her to give him the prece∣dency in merit, yet she knew not how to resolve to withdraw her heart from <HI>Philip,</HI> to bestow it upon a Mutilated Lover. At length after the Services per∣form'd, they return'd all three to the City, where <HI>Ʋrania</HI> being press'd by her Parents, declar'd
<PB N="131" REF="80"/> in favour of <HI>Philip.</HI> Whereup∣on <HI>Philaretes</HI> understanding her resolution, took upon him ano∣ther Resolution, that is to dye. Now though by the Law of Na∣ture, which only takes place in this small Territory, a Man might lay violent hands upon himself without a Crime, however who does it without consent of the Council, is lookt upon as an uncivil Companion that would take a Journey without taking leave of his Friends; and therefore there is a Decree, that his Body shall be carry'd forth of the Territories of the State, as a Fugitive adjudg'd unworthy of burial. Thereupon the Dispair∣ing Lover to avoid the scandal and Affront, requested leave to make himself away in this man∣ner.</P>
<P><HI>My Lords, if there be no per∣son
<PB N="132" REF="81"/> within this venerable Assembly that has experimented the Rigours to which I am reduc'd by the ex∣cess of my Love, it will signifie nothing for me to speak, since I have nothing to hope from the E∣quity of my Judges. It behoves me to be a person that has loved with the same Passion, which still I have for the fair</HI> Urania, <HI>not∣withstanding her Refusal of me, to be in a capacity to do reason to the Justice of my demand. But if there be not any Person here, as probably it is so well experienc'd, the Torments which I suffer being too violent to continue to that ve∣nerable Old Age that adorns those Seats of Judicature, I hope that Reason will supply the defect of an Experience which your Wisdom was too great at any time to un∣dergo. The loss of so principal a Member had been a pretence spe∣cious
<PB N="133" REF="81"/> enough for me to have de∣manded your Permission to die; and I had done it before now, had not my hopes of possessing</HI> Urania <HI>moderated in some measure the bitter Woes of my languishing life, after that only Blessing has failed me, that could create within me a desire to save it. Now then since her Resolution has condemned me to Miseries that ne're will end, and that by this condemnation I find my self a burthen to my self, troublesome to my Parents, ridi∣culous to the World, and unprofit∣able to the State, I have bethought my self, that there is no other way to shun this perpetual and cruel Torment, but by the only way that Nature puts into our Hands. You grant it to a poor decrepit old Creature, with the same Freedom as you permit the pulling down of a House when it is ready to fall.
<PB N="134" REF="82"/> Nor do you refuse the same leave to young Paralyticks, nor to any per∣son that is seiz'd with an incurable Distemper. Seeing then my Di∣sease is such that nothing but death can cure, it is not reasonable that you should deny it me, seeing my Condition is worse than that of the most miserable. Now if my mis∣fortune will not prevail to per∣swade you to do me justice, I beg your Permission as a Favour.</HI></P>
<P>The Novelty of a Cause, for which there had not been a Pre∣sident in any Age before, so strangely surpriz'd the Judges, that they had never agreed in favour of the Suppliant, but that <HI>Alcibiades</HI> assured them, That he had just such another design in his Youth, from which nothing could have diverted him but the change of a better Fortune, and that most certainly it was a
<PB N="135" REF="82"/> great piece of Cruelty to con∣strain a person to live whether he would or no, in torments un∣known to any but himself that endures them. So that his Opi∣nion having brought over those that dissented before, the Presi∣dent pronounced sentence in this manner.</P>
<P>Philaretes, <HI>the Senate gives you leave to depart the World; you may do it when you please, and after what manner you think fit.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Ʋrania</HI> being inform'd of the matter, came to the Senate to prevent him; for her heart could no longer resist the sensible At∣tacques of a Passion so tender. After Sentence pronounced, she met him coming out of the Se∣nate-house, to whom <HI>Philaretes,</HI> preventing her, <HI>Behold,</HI> said he, <HI>my Goddess, the Victim which my Love offers to your Divinity!
<PB N="136" REF="83"/> How!</HI> said she, <HI>have they pro∣nounc'd the Sentence of my Death? For your Death will infallibly be mine. No,</HI> replied <HI>Philaretes, I am going to die, that you may live and enjoy your fill of Happi∣ness and Content.</HI> At those words she seemed to be in a Trance; from whence recover∣ing her self, she accompanied her Martyr to his Lodging, and be∣sought him to surcease the Exe∣cution of the Decree for some days: Which he did, in regard his Affection had rendred him a perfect Slave to her Will. All that time she spent in perswading him to live, with an absolute Promise to marry him. But it was impossible, out of an Appre∣hension that the Senate would take him for a meer Deluder and a <HI>Braggadochio. Ʋrania</HI> there∣fore seeing him unflexible, re∣solv'd
<PB N="137" REF="83"/> to follow his Example, no less tormented than her Lover; and the better to bring her De∣sign to pass, she requested him only to marry her before he died; to which, not knowing the de∣sign that lay conceal'd in her Breast, he readily consented. Thereupon they were married in due form, with the mutual Consent of their Parents, who kept the Nuptial Feasts accor∣ding to the Custome. At the end of which, <HI>Philaretes</HI> with∣drew himself privately from his Father-in-law's House to go and kill himself in his own, without the knowledge of his Wife. But he could not deceive her, for she was soon at his Heels, and find∣ing him ready to swallow a large Quantity of <HI>Opium,</HI> which his Mother had brought him in a Gold Cup; <HI>Since,</HI> said she, <HI>I
<PB N="138" REF="84"/> can by no means engage you to live with me, necessity obliges me to end my days together with you.</HI> And so saying, she desir'd her own Mo∣ther, who had follow'd her, to prepare her a Cup of the same Beverage, which could not be refus'd her, since the Custom of the Country permits that such Wives who will may follow their Husbands in death. Thereupon the two Mothers paid that morn∣ful Office to their Children with those sad Sentiments which are natural to Women upon such Oc∣casions. They drank both to∣gether, and then embracing each other, after a thousand tender kisses, they both fell into a sweet slumber, never more to wake. Their Bodies were both burnt in the same Funeral Pile, and their Ashes being mix'd together, were thrown upon the same Bed
<PB N="139" REF="84"/> of Earth, according to the Cu∣stom of their Funerals. Howe∣ver to preserve the Memory of so rare an Action, they caus'd to be engrav'd upon a Marble Mo∣nument against the Garden Wall two Rings one within another, in the midst of a flaming fire, with this Motto <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, to inti∣mate, <HI>That neither Death it self could part them.</HI></P>
<P>The Wards are subdivided in∣to Tribes; the Council Ward in∣to Twelve, the Suns Ward into Thirteen, and the Schools Ward into five only, because the Col∣leges and Manufactures take up the greatest part of it. The Council of <HI>Thirty</HI> also deputes Three out of the Two hunder'd and seventy to govern every Tribe; of which the one takes care of the Concerns within, the other without; that is to say, of
<PB N="140" REF="85"/> the Farms belonging to his Tribe, and the Third is superin∣tendant over the Magazines; for every Tribe hath its particular Magazines, to which the private People repair every day to fetch their necessary Provisions. There is nothing of servitude among them, for they are all their own Servants, only when they grow old they are waited upon by their Children, who upon their returns from performing their Duties in the Farms, or other Places, retire to their Parents whom they Honour and Reve∣rence as long as they live.</P>
<P>The Schools are their Semina∣ries of Vertue, Sciences and Arts, as well Military as Civil, where their Children are educated un∣der excellent Masters, who the first year trie the Disposition and Genius of their Scholars, and if
<PB N="141" REF="85"/> they find any one uncapable of learning, they inform the Super∣intendant, who sends him to the Manufactures with leave to make choice of what Trade he pleases, which he is taught by Masters made choice of by the Council of Thirty: And under these Ma∣sters it is that they follow their several Callings, in several Apart∣ments of the Building, bestow∣ing their pains upon all things either necessary or seemly for the use of human Life, and their Labours are afterwards distribu∣ted into the Magazines for the common Service of the People.</P>
<P>The first things taught in these Schools are the Mathematicks, of which they learn all the Parts, e∣ven to Astronomy, wherein they excel: For as for Astrology they reject it as a frivolous thing. And indeed I could wish that
<PB N="142" REF="86"/> such as waste their Time in that Study, or make it their business to consult our Astrologers con∣cerning their future Destinies, and all such who shall read these Travels had the same scorn and contempt of Astrology which this wise People, by me so for∣tunately discover'd, have. Give me leave therefore to say this by the by, for the Edification of my Reader, since so fair an Op∣portunity presents it self, that I my self formerly study'd this Art, and had made so fair a Pro∣gress in the knowledge of Schemes and Horoscopes, that I began to be in high Request; but more the success which my Master had who taught me at <HI>Rome,</HI> who was Astrologer to Queen <HI>Christina.</HI> However the better to assure my self of the solidity of this Art, I was resolv'd
<PB N="143" REF="86"/> to surprize him: To this pur∣pose, one Morning I presented him the Figure of my Nativity, which I had been calculating all night long, accompany'd with his own Directions. Very true it is, that he knew of himself that it was mine; but then the Oppo∣sition of Saturn to my Ascendant in the third Degree, which is my third Year, he made a doubt of it, not believing that I had e∣scaped so fatal a direction. Thereupon requesting him to tell me what it was, <HI>A Shipwrack,</HI> said he, <HI>wherein I should absolute∣ly perish.</HI> This answer, more convincing to me than that of <HI>Thrasibulus</HI> to <HI>Tiberius</HI> in the Island of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> made me stand in Admiration. Afterwards searching by what means I might avoid the danger, he observ'd that Venus came to my assistance,
<PB N="144" REF="87"/> by correcting the Malignity of Saturn. This lucky Accident ha∣ving encourag'd me to make a farther Progress in a Study, whereby I thought to have rais'd my self above Humanity, I fell to it seriously, and spent six Months in the examination of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> till I came to that pas∣sage, where he says, That they whose <HI>Horoscope</HI> or <HI>Ascendant</HI> the Leg of <HI>Capricorn</HI> governs, should be troubl'd with Diseases in the Legs; which is one of the grand Maxims held at this day by the Astrologers, as are all the rest of this great Master in their Art. But then said I to my self 'tis not the immoveable Point or space of the Heavens which influences, but rather the Constellation which is there plac'd, of which the Leg makes a part, and from whence that twelfth Part of the
<PB N="145" REF="87"/> <HI>Zodiack</HI> deriv'd its name, in the time of <HI>Ptolomy,</HI> above seventeen Ages ago. Now every Age the Stars of the Figure advancing a de∣gree from the East to the West, they ought to have recoil'd as much. Nevertheless our Astrolo∣gers at present call those Parts or Spaces by the same name, and ground their Predictions thereup∣on, as if the Figure were still fix'd in the same place. Besides supposing that the Leg of <HI>Capricorn</HI> had not chang'd place, who does not dis∣cern that this Maxim was ground∣ed upon the Relation of one Limb to another purely Imaginary, there being nothing of Reality in any of these Figures; so that the Foun∣dation of their Art appearing to me so vain, I took a disliking to the Science it self. Many other Reasons also so cleanly convinc'd me of the falsity of it, that at length I quite
<PB N="146" REF="88"/> and clean abandon'd it. Seeing that if the Astrologer lit upon a past Accident for once, I attribute it, as the Learned Persons of this Country of the Sun do, meerly to Chance, which sometimes may pro∣duce a Truth among thousands of Lyes.</P>
<P>From the Mathematicks they pass to Grammar learning, withal at the same time to write and speak well; and among all the other Di∣alects the <HI>Attic</HI> there prevailes, in regard that they have not had any Commerce with Foreign Nations, whence proceeds the Corruption of Languages; whereby it comes to pass, that they have preserv'd the purity of their own, as have also some Villages of <HI>Greece</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> where they speak the pure litteral Greek; for that living at a distance from the Sea, and in a Country of difficult access, they
<PB N="147" REF="88"/> enjoy the same good Fortune. For which, besides the Testimony of <HI>Davity,</HI> I have also the Authority of the Reverend and Learned <HI>Pa∣pa, Michael</HI> of <HI>Epirus,</HI> who but lately assur'd me at <HI>Venice,</HI> that he had met with such in his Travels.</P>
<P>By this time their Judgments being rightly inform'd, they be∣come more fit to read Philosophy, which they learn in the last place. They have also their bodily Exer∣cises, being taught at the same time to handle their Arms both Rapier and Back-sword, to shoot with their Bows, and to ride the manag'd Horse, in a place appointed for that purpose, where also are admitted the Manufacture Apprentices. They never teach Logick nor Rhetorick; alledging that those two Sciences are as natural to a Man as to goe, or to make use of his Hands; and that no man can arrive to be an
<PB N="148" REF="89"/> exquisite Logician, or a perfect Orator that has not an excelling Genius that way. However they give their Scholars certain general Precepts, very much agreeing with the Maxims of the <HI>Epicureans.</HI></P>
<P>They also read and expound in their Schools <HI>Aristotle, Plato, Socra∣tes, Epicurus, Democritus, Thales, Di∣ogenes,</HI> and all the ancient Philoso∣phers, of which we have only the Names; and whose writings they preserve; leaving to their Scholars to choose what Opinion they think most probable. They also permit them to read the Poets, though very much incens'd against them, for their Invention of Fa∣bles concerning Deities that never were. For by the Converse which I had among them I found that their knowledge in Philosophy was altogether bounded by Sence, which they take for the only Rule
<PB N="149" REF="89"/> of their Reasoning, the Extrava∣gancies of which are to be mode∣rated and corrected by themselves, being perswaded that what can∣not be apprehended by the Sence, is not at all, nor can be the object of our Meditations. To which when I answer'd that the contrary was taught in our Schools, that is to say that Reason corrected the Sence, they lookt upon it as ridi∣culous, as if a Blind man should go about to correct his Guide.</P>
<P>They generally believe the E∣ternity of the first matter, not be∣ing able to conceive how any thing should be made out of nothing; that the World with all its varie∣ties was produc'd by the sympathy and antipathy of the first Body's, which as they had no beginning will have no ending. They make some Bodies moveable of them∣selves; others by the impulse of
<PB N="150" REF="90"/> those only in a void space. They acknowledge no other Cause but one, which is the Material. For all which Opinions of theirs I do not here produce their several Reasons, as designing at present only a Hi∣storical Relation; which else would require a larger Volume by it self, which perhaps I may here∣after put to publick view.</P>
<P>If any one begin to broach new Opinions they cite him before the Council, who examine them, and if they find them ill grounded, the Person is not commanded to re∣cant, but only to hold his Peace, un∣der the Penalty of being put into the number of the <HI>Scandalous;</HI> a List of whose names is affix'd to the Door of the Temple, there to remain to perpetuity: an afflicti∣on, which next to exile, they stand most in fear of.</P>
<P>Their Library more spacious than
<PB N="151" REF="90"/> the <HI>Vatican,</HI> is so much the more Curious, by how much it is fur∣nish'd with an infinite number of Authors, of which we know not so much as the Names, and such as liv'd before <HI>Aristotle.</HI> Those they call the ancient Authors; for the Modern they esteem to be those that wrote after their settle∣ment, which is above Two thou∣sand years ago. They shew'd me also Translations of <HI>Egyptian</HI> Books, which make the World to be much more ancient than we be∣lieve it to be; our Chronology being no more than a Great Grand Child of theirs.</P>
<P>As for Printing tho' they well know what it is, yet they make no use of it; so that all their Books are in Munuscript, either in Parch∣ment or Paper, in the Greek Lan∣guage, in regard they know no other; unless it be the <HI>Tartarian,</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="91"/> which by what means some of them come to understand I shall relate in due place.</P>
<P>They distinguish their Books ac∣cording to the Quality of the Sub∣jects. And if any Author of their own writes any thing new, his Book is not admitted into this No∣ble Society of Volums, till it has had the Approbation of the Coun∣cil of Thirty: Private Men may have it before, but few care for it till then; so great a veneration they have for the Judgment of that most noble Assembly, all compo∣sed of learned and chosen Men, the flowre of Philosophers, as are also the two hunder'd and seventy.</P>
<P>Among the Legislators, I saw the Pentateuch of <HI>Moses,</HI> tran∣slated by the care of <HI>Alexander,</HI> and sent to his Master <HI>Aristotle,</HI> as some Lines under his own hand, at the end of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> wit∣ness.
<PB N="153" REF="91"/> I ask'd them their Senti∣ments concerning that Law; to which they answer'd that they had a great esteem for the Moral part, dislik'd his Sacrifices, condemn'd his Ceremonies, and for his Histo∣rical part, some they deem'd pro∣bable, the rest very improbable: One of the Company added that he was a Philosopher, that he had too enigmatically describ'd the Generation of the World, and of the Creatures therein to a blockish sort of People, uncapable to ap∣prehend it by methodical Reason∣ing: That he believ'd with <HI>Moses,</HI> that man was produc'd out of the Earth, and that without doubt he had borrow'd that Opinion from the learning of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> a∣mong whom he confesses himself to have had his Education.</P>
<P>At length I came to the Book which was left by the <HI>French</HI> man
<PB N="154" REF="92"/> of whom I have already made mention. They kept it apart, not knowing where to range it, be∣cause they did not understand it: I found it to be a New Testament. Whereupon they earnestly request∣ed me to translate it for them, if I thought it worth my while. Up∣on which I pull'd out a Greek Te∣stament out of my Pocket, that had been my <HI>Vade Mecum</HI> in all my Travels, and by way of prevention, instead of a Translation, said I, here is the Original, which you may read at your leisure, because I do here present it to your Library. At which they were overjoy'd, and gave me a thousand Thanks. After which they led me into the Apart∣ment where all their Curiosities were kept; and there I beheld a Collection of all that ever the Bo∣som of Nature produc'd, or ever was invented by Art. Among the
<PB N="155" REF="92"/> rest I saw several Cases of Letters with all the furniture belonging to a Printing-House; several sorts of Fire arms, of which they prais'd the Invention, but condemn'd the use as treacherous and cruel; <HI>Py∣robolick</HI> Mirrours, that cast forth Fire in a moment; a flying Engin; Prospective Glasses, by which I could distinguish in the Moon Hil∣locks, Valleys, Medows, Forrests, and if not Animals, at least some small moving Machines. They also shew'd me in the same place, Mon∣sters, half men, half beasts, of I know not what kind, preserv'd in Chrystals fill'd with Spirit of Wine. Microscopes, shewing all the Vital Parts of a Hand-worm, and of all those little Insects flying in the Air, which the most piercing Eye could hardly discern without the assistance of these Glasses: Cu∣rious Watches and Clocks, of
<PB N="156" REF="93"/> which they make no use, as be∣lieving them superfluous, in regard that being so expert as they are in Astronomy, they can tell what hour it is either by day or night; for that the Air is not there much subject to be overcast. As for their Climate their own Astronomical Observations reckon it two and forty Degrees, far from the Equi∣noctial Line; and their own Miri∣dian is the first in their own Maps.</P>
<P>Now tho' they inhabit a Coun∣try abounding in all things that may render Life agreeable and commodious, yet they live after a most sparing and austere manner. For they affect not the delicious tastes of Drink or costly Viands, unless when they are sick, or make great Banquets, which they never do but only upon certain Occasi∣ons, and that very rarely, as at Weddings, the Birth of their Chil∣dren,
<PB N="157" REF="93"/> Receptions of Strangers or the like, without being thereto constrain'd, however by any Laws or Decrees. They eat about some three hours after they rise in a Morning; but their chief Meals are in the Evening about three hours before they go to bed. Their Magazins furnish them with course Food, Bread and Wine; but for Venison and Fish they eat none, but what they hunt and catch themselves, or what their Children send them from their Country Houses.</P>
<P>Their Habit is plain, made of Wooll dy'd of a Violet Colour for the Men, and white for the Wo∣men; which is the only distinction of their two Sexes. As to the fa∣shion, it is the same us'd all along by the Ancients, with a Stole up∣on their Shoulders after the man∣ner of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> to cover them
<PB N="158" REF="94"/> in the Country from the Sun, or when they are forc'd to go in the Rain. As to other things, bare∣headed and bare footed, only in a Leather Sandal lin'd within side with Wooll. They that have Jew∣els may wear them; and as for the three hunder'd they are distin∣guish'd by their Scarlet habit, which none besides are allow'd to wear.</P>
<P>There are no profess'd Physici∣ans among them, for they all un∣derstand Physick. 'Tis very true that in difficult Cases they call a Philosopher, who comes upon the same Conditions as their Pleaders without any Fee: Their usual Re∣medies they take from Trees, Herbs and Roots growing in their own Grounds, which have the same Qualities, with Cassia, Senna, and Scammony, and with which they suddenly cure all Distempers that are curable. For in regard
<PB N="159" REF="94"/> that Noble Science is there pra∣ctis'd for no advantage of gain, the Philosopher who is sent for never seeks to prolong the Cure; besides that making up their Prescrip∣tions themselves, they have no∣thing to fear on the Apothecaries part, whose Avarice or <HI>qui pro quo</HI> often times does the Patient more injury than the Distemper it self. There is not a Surgeon nor a Bar∣ber to be seen, for they never let blood, as not being to be perswad∣ed that they ought to wound a Patient to cure him; or that the Blood which is the seat of the Soul, with which it has so strict an Alliance, that it seems to be inse∣perable, ought to be spilt to make it better, seeing that which remains in the Body is as bad as before the Blood letting; but that it is better corrected by <HI>Catharticks,</HI> which se∣parate from its Mass the Humours
<PB N="160" REF="95"/> which infect it, without taking a∣way that which is good, and that the quantity of it may be dimi∣nish'd at any time by Diet, Exer∣cise, and Sweating.</P>
<P>As to Wounds and Bruises, they proceed after the same method as in Fevers; that is to say, they cure themselves with the assistance of a Philosopher if need require.</P>
<P>The Women shave and trim their Husbands, of whom they are so jealous, that they will not suffer any bodies hands to come neer their Faces but their own.</P>
<P>The Philosophers have also spe∣cific Remedies for the Diseases of the Soul, the continual use of which fortifies the Memory and purifies the Wit in such a manner, that they will make a Dunce Ingenious. It is a Composition of which we have the ingredients in this part of the World; and of which I have
<PB N="161" REF="95"/> often made use since my return into Europe, with good success as well to my self as to others. You see there none that are troubl'd with the Gout, in regard they are both sober, temperate, and active; besides that the Continence of the two Sexes is so great, that there is no harbour there for that same Disease which the <HI>Italians</HI> call the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>If a sick Person be given over as past recovery, there is no need of a Comforter, because they do not conceive there is any evil in death, which they look upon as only a meer Cessation from Acti∣on and Thought, which may pos∣sibly return one day, if the Par∣ticles from whence the same Acti∣on and Thought deriv'd their first beginning should happen to reu∣nite. The Children burn the Body of their Parents deceas'd in their
<PB N="162" REF="96"/> own Gardens, and scatter their Ashes upon the Earth; believing that the enlivening Atoms are cha∣rioted up in the Flames to their first Original, which they believe to be the Sun; and by their mix∣ture of the Ashes with the Earth, they believe that in eating the Plants which proceed from thence, that they enliven the more gross and terrestrial Portion of their Pa∣rents. To speak the truth, I at∣tribute the goodness of the Air which they breath in those Parts, partly to this Custom, which ren∣ders it so free from those Infections which the stinking Exhalations of the Bodies interr'd in our Cities are the certain cause of among us.</P>
<P>In regard their Commerce is not great, 'tis not very possible should be Rich. However they are not poor neither; for that the fertility of the Soil furnishes them with all
<PB N="163" REF="96"/> things necessary for the support and pleasure of Life, and to spare. So that they send the superfluity of their Provisions and Manufactures once a year to a Fair that is held between the Confines of this State, and the <HI>Great Moguls</HI> Country, where they Barter their Commo∣dities for Pearls, Diamonds, and other Precious Stones, or else for Gold and Silver coyn'd, for the be∣nefit of the Publick Treasure, which surpasses in value those of St. <HI>Denis, Loretto</HI> and St. <HI>Mark,</HI> put them altogether tho' they be the Richest that I have seen in Europe. Nor do they prohibit private Per∣sons from sending their Goods thi∣ther, and Trading upon their own accounts. For after they are out of their times, and have done that Service which is requir'd from them for the Benefit of the Coun∣try Farms, or otherwise, till they
<PB N="164" REF="97"/> come to be Thirty years of Age, they have then liberty to work at home, for the Ornament of them∣selves and their Houses. Besides, that whatever they do for the Ser∣vice of the Commonwealth is sure to be publickly rewarded; and with this wealth, either purchas'd by their Industry or their Vertue, they feast and give Portions to their Children when they marry them.</P>
<P>Now altho' they lye surrounded by the <HI>Tartarians,</HI> yet are they not at War with any body: For the Great <HI>Kam,</HI> who has always had a high esteem for them, by reason of their Integrity, permits them to live in Peace and Tranquillity one among another. In acknow∣ledgment of which favour, they furnish him at all times with a small Regiment of 300. Men, under Thirty years of Age, who go to serve him voluntarily, and all the
<PB N="165" REF="97"/> time that they stay there, is lookt upon as if they had spent it in the Service of the State. These 300 choose themselves their own Colo∣nel, who swears fidelity to the Great <HI>Kam;</HI> who at his first arri∣val presents him with very fair Arms and Weapons, and gives him leave to make choice of six Leiutenants, to Command every one under him Fifty Men a peice. Nor do they ever return from his Service without a considerable Re∣ward; and they that signalize them∣selves by any extraordinary At∣chievement, are rewarded moreo∣ver according to their Merit. Thus it is that they come to understand the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Language, of which the People of this Country make use in their Commerce by the as∣sistance of one or two of these In∣terpreters, who are deputed by the Council to attend the Fair.
<PB N="166" REF="98"/> When they are ready to March to the Great <HI>Kam,</HI> the Council gives them an Order to take Arms out of the <HI>Arsenal,</HI> which is al∣ways furnish'd to Arm Sixty thou∣sand Men upon occasion. Their Offensive Arms are a Bow, a Sci∣mitar, a Mace of Iron, a Javelin, and a Pike; their Defensive only a Buckler and a Helmet.</P>
<P>All the while that I convers'd with them I could not find that they had any Notion of God after our manner; in regard that as I have said, their Philosophy solely depends upon Sence. As for those Deities which either Poetry, Fear, or Imagination has set up, they are too wise to acknowledg; so that I have nothing to say concerning their Religion, except you call Religion that which they believe and practise concerning the Sun.</P>
<P>For they unanimously hold that
<PB N="167" REF="98"/> Planet to be the most Lovely, the most Powerful, and the most Be∣neficent of all the Beings. They are perswaded that it is the Soul of the World, and that the Beams of the Sun being incorporated into the Creatures give motion to their Corporeal Mass, the external Fi∣gure of which makes the Princi∣pal difference which we see be∣tween them. Tho' they do not deny but that their different In∣ternal Operations may proceed as well from the variety of little Bodies, with which they are mix'd, as from the Beams of the Sun more or less purify'd. They assert the Sun to be a Globe of Fire exactly rarify'd, and shining in the Center of the World, as being the heart which animates all the Parts of it; and the Element or Principle of Souls to which they all return up∣on their seperation from the Body,
<PB N="168" REF="99"/> as the Water returns to the Sea, discharging it self from the Land. Every tenth day of the year they go to the Temple to be there when the Sun Rises; and as soon as the Sun appears through one of those holes which mark out the Degrees of the <HI>Eccliptick,</HI> the <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="oxf" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or Priestess, who is chosen for the excellency of her Beauty out of all the Virgins in their Ter∣ritory, ascends the uppermost Step that serves instead of a Tri∣poss, clad in a Vestment of Cloth of Gold, with open and hanging Sleeves, whence, her Arms come forth cover'd with a fine Linnen shift, which is fasten'd together be∣tween her Elbows and her Shoul∣ders with a Bracelet of Diamonds; her head Crown'd with a Garland of Flowers, a Necklace of large Peral about her neck; two Em∣rauld Pendants Pear-fashion'd,
<PB N="169" REF="99"/> hanging at her Ears, her Hair di∣shevell'd, crisp'd and curling with∣out Art, and carelesly flowing down her Breast and Back; her Mantle clasp'd under her Chin, with an Oriental Girasol, weigh∣ing thirty Carats, and enchas'd in Diamonds, of which a great num∣ber glitter'd upon her Fingers. To this Priestess thus accouter'd, a most lovely Youth presents her with a little Casket of Gold curiously wrought, out of which she takes a certain quantity of Perfumes, which she throws into the Perfumer of which I have already spoken; after the performance of which Ceremony, presently you hear a noise of Trumpets plac'd upon the Cornish, and after that a Symphony of excellent Voices and Instruments chosen out of the School, who sing the following Stanza's, the Haut∣boys and Violins intermixing their harmony by turns.

<PB N="171" REF="100"/> The People below also repeat these <HI>Stanzas,</HI> keeping time to their Voices with a confus'd but merry dance, while the Priestess is busily employ'd in supplying the Censer with Incence; who after she has sufficiently embalm'd all the Peo∣ple with her Perfumes, ascending by the middle of the Roof, goes up to the Sun it self to refresh him with a costly Repast; for they believe him to be nourish'd with the Exhalations which ascend to him incessantly, as well from the Earth as from the other Planets, by the Order of Circulation, which they acknowledge to be in the great World as well as in the <HI>Mi∣crocosm.</HI> The rest of the day they spend in Pastimes and divertizing themselves, either in their Houses, or in their Delightful Vicinities, which consist in Medows, Groves or Fishponds, which are form'd by
<PB N="172" REF="101"/> the Concourse of the adjoining Rivulets.</P>
<P>From the Principal Outlets of the City, you walk to the Confines of their Country Houses, under the Shade of long Rows of Elms planted in a streight Line, which affords the pleasure also of a fair Prospect, to those that promenade through the Chief Streets, at the end of every one of which there stands a Portal all of costly Archi∣tecture, which at night are only barr'd with a single Draw-bridge about the height of a Man, as be∣ing made rather to terminate the sight than for any defenee. For the City has no more than one single Moat of running Water, to pre∣vent the entrance of Wild Beasts, (which rarely happens) nevertheless they do adventure so far, by reason they are continually hunted by the Youth of the Country that are put
<PB N="173" REF="101"/> to manure the Land. Besides that they breed up great Mastiff Dogs so strong and so couragious, that they will encounter with success the most Savage of Wild Beasts, against which they only exercise their fierceness, being no less tame in the Company of Men, whose Guardians they seem to be, taking their Rounds day and night about the Fields, with their Iron Collers stuck with sharp Nails. When the Hunters take a Lyon, or any such dangerous and mischeivous Crea∣ture, they nail him to a Tree at the Avenues into the Territories, as formerly the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> did up∣on their Walls. And indeed the small number of those Wild Beasts which is to be found in a Country whither the numerous Herds and Flocks of Cattle are sufficient Baits to entice them, shews them to be terrify'd by such Executions.
<PB N="174" REF="102"/> Their Tillage and rural Habitati∣ons take their beginning at about a Mile distance from the City Moat, all the Delightful space be∣tween being allotted for publick Recreation.</P>
<P>Their year which begins just at the Winter Solstice, is divided in∣to six and thirty <HI>Decads</HI> of days, and so they count the first, second, &amp;c. day of every <HI>Decad;</HI> and the time which remains till the Point of Revolution, they call the <HI>Surplusage;</HI> and pass it altogether as they do the tenth day of every <HI>Decad.</HI> By which means they a∣void the Fopperies and Trifles of <HI>Bissextiles</HI> and <HI>Epacts,</HI> which the most cautious corrections of our Ka∣lenders cannot free from mistakes.</P>
<P>They begin their <HI>Epochs</HI> from the Solstice next ensuing the Instal∣lation of <HI>Misargyrus,</HI> and adjust their Chronology by his Successors,
<PB N="175" REF="102"/> whose Portraitures to the Life they preserve in their Treasury, to the number of One hunder'd and fourscore, till the time of <HI>Philopoe∣men,</HI> their Chief President at the time when I was there. And this is all the Chief recompence of their Supream Presidents for all their care and pains in the Government of the State; the Publick Cau∣ses two fair Medals of his Face to be cast in Gold, of which the one is laid up in the Treasury, the o∣ther is bestow'd upon the Person himself, who leaves it to his Family at his death, as a Mark of Honour to encourage his Posterity to fol∣low his Steps. In a word, for a Conclusion of all that can be said touching the Manners and Customs of these People, I must needs a∣ver, that they are so regular and just, that the Age of Gold may seem to continue still among them
<PB N="176" REF="103"/> They mutually assist each other in all their Affairs, and love one an∣other to that Degree, that you would take them all for Brethren.</P>
<P>Thus therefore having taken a view of all that was to be seen in this admirable City, I spent the best part of my Time with <HI>Eugenes,</HI> ei∣ther in the Schools, or in the Li∣brary; where I was present at their Readings and Disputes. For be∣sides the lesser Apartments appoin∣ted for their youth, there is one large Hall where the marry'd Peo∣ple of both Sexes meet every Morn∣ing and Evening, to hear the Dis∣courses of Physick and Morality which the Philosophers there make in their several Turns; and where they take all the Liberty which our Preachers assume to reprehend Vice. Their Disputes contain no∣thing of the Pedantick, there is not to be heard <HI>I deny your Major,</HI> or <HI>I
<PB N="177" REF="103"/> prove my Minor.</HI> The Head of the School propounds a <HI>Thesis,</HI> which a Schollar undertaking maintains with the best Arguments he can produce, and is then oppos'd by another; after which three Philosophers give their judgment who has done best.</P>
<P>As to their Ponunciation it a∣grees with that of our Criticks; in which they differ from our <HI>Euro∣pian</HI> Greeks; and I made it my Business also to turn over the Books of several Ancient Philosophers, which we want, the suppression of which, though falsly, is laid to the charge of <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Ambition. By the reading of which I found the Modesty of those Great Men, who never asserted their Opinions like Arrogant Dogmatists, but only as Doubts, or as Answers which to them seem'd probable, in satisfacti∣on of the Questions which were to
<PB N="178" REF="104"/> them propos'd. So that <HI>Anaxago∣ras</HI>'s Fire, <HI>Thales</HI>'s Water, <HI>Democri∣tus</HI>'s Attomes, set forth by another whose name I have forgot, are only means to explain the Genera∣tion of things which to them seem'd probable, being there supported by Chymical Experiences without asserting any thing Positive.</P>
<P>Among their Authors of <HI>My∣thology</HI> I found the <HI>Greek</HI> New Testament which I had presented them. Of which I demanded the Reason from the Library Keeper: who answer'd me, That he had observ'd most excellent Precepts of Morality therein; but by reason of a Celestial Genealogy, and some other particulars, that did not seem rationably to be believ'd, he had rank'd it among those Vo∣lumes, by advice of his Council compos'd of Four other Philoso∣phers, deputed as he was, by the
<PB N="179" REF="104"/> Thirty. Thereupon I took an oc∣casion to unfold to them the Prin∣ciples of the Christian Religion, so universally believ'd by the Princes and Potentates of Europe; how∣ever without making any progress among them, because I had to do with People that acknowledg'd no other Authority but that of Sence and Reason, which cannot appre∣hend the Mysteries of Faith. But when I came to tell them of one Nature in three Persons, of two Natures in one Person, and one invisible incorporeal Deity, who was All in All, and All in every Part; born in a Stable, Crucify'd upon a Cross, and reproducing himself every day in a thousand Parts of the World to be swallow'd by his Adorers, they began to dis∣course among themselves that I was frantick, and talk'd already of send∣ing me among the mad Folks, so
<PB N="180" REF="105"/> that I was forc'd to change my Language.</P>
<P>If there be such a God, said one to me, as you describe, who would be Worshipt by all the Earth ac∣cording to the Religion which you propose, and that this Faith is the only way to gain Heaven, and shun everlasting Torment, it had become his Wisdom, his Goodness and his Omnipotency, to have caus'd it to have been divulg'd a∣broad at first through all the Uni∣verse, after the clearest and most intelligible manner imaginable, to prevent the ruin of so many Men who have perish'd according to your Principles, for these sixteen Centuries past, because they never heard of any such thing. Instead of exposing an Innocent Son to the severity of Torment, he should have sent him into the World with an Equipage answerable to his
<PB N="181" REF="105"/> Birth, that he might have been heard with more respect; with an Army to render him formidable; and with Lightning in his hand to terrifie those that would not obey his Law. Here I shew'd them the necessity of Christs Humility, un∣folding to them the Mystery of our Redemption; and giving them to understand that there was no other way for the Redeemer to expiate our Crimes, and fully to satisfie the Justice of the Father. Where is that Judge, reply'd my Antagonist, that would condemn an Innocent Son for the sake of Criminals? e∣specially it being in his sole and only Power to save by a meer amnisty. Notwithstanding all this, after I had laid before them all that the <HI>Sorbon,</HI> and the best Divines of the Church had taught me, of most profound and most refin'd con∣cerning these Matters, I was con∣strain'd
<PB N="182" REF="106"/> to put an end to my Dis∣pute, in regard those Centlemen denying my Foundations, it was impossible for me to make any breach in their Belief.</P>
<P>I remain'd a whole Month in this Sun-adoring Country, some∣times in the City, sometimes in the Country, whither I kept some of the Citizens Company, who went to make merry with their Children. And indeed I could willingly have ended my days in this place, had not the Remem∣brance of my Friends and my Af∣fairs in Europe oblig'd me to re∣turn. Which I did, after I had taken leave of the Senate, who or∣der'd that I should be furnish'd with a Waggon to the Borders of their Territories; and that the Archon of the last Country Farm should in my behalf agree with a <HI>Tartar</HI> to conduct me to the <HI>Caspi∣an</HI>
<PB N="183" REF="106"/> Sea. I must confess I made a Proposition to <HI>Eugenes</HI> and some o∣thers, to have taken a Journey in∣to <HI>Europe;</HI> but they very frankly told me, That there was not any thing which I had related to them, concerning our Parts of the World that bred in them the least Inclina∣tion to undergo so great a trouble. Upon that I presented my Friend with an Emrald sorrounded with Diamonds; and he presented me with the Works of <HI>Democritus,</HI> and <HI>Thales</HI> the <HI>Milesian,</HI> together with a certain Stone, which our Lapidaries know not what to make of. After that taking leave of my Friend upon the Frontiers, whe∣ther he had accompany'd me, as well out of friendship, as by the Orders of the Thirty, in hopes to see each other again, I betook my self to the Conduct of my <HI>Tartar,</HI> who taking a neerer but more dif∣ficult
<PB N="184" REF="107"/> way than what I had travell'd before, gave me opportunity of seeing several Countries, not much unlike those Beautiful and Charm∣ing Glooms that adorn the <HI>Alpes</HI> of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> of which I intend to give a Description, if these my present Travels find a favourable reception.</P>
<P>In six Weeks time I came to a Village by the Sea-side, where to comfort me for the loss of <HI>Eugenes,</HI> I had the happiness to meet with <HI>Monthresor,</HI> who after the usual Embraces, and Tender Expressi∣ons, which such an unexpected meeting could invent, gave me an accompt, how that after he had been carry'd away by the impetu∣osity of the Current, he enter'd into a deep Water, salt and still; which made him believe himself to be in the Sea, where he often lanch'd himself forth according to
<PB N="185" REF="107"/> the Art of swimming; that at first he found some resistance at the top, which made him swim between the two Waters, darting himself forth withal the strength he could, till at length he gain'd the Shore of the Sea that washes this Coast. I ask'd him what he saw remarkable under that same <HI>Tartarian Pausillipus.</HI> To which he answer'd that by the thick darkness of that dreadful Cave, tho' it were at Noon day, he could make no Observation by his sight, but that his Ears were ter∣rify'd with a Horrid Whistling, of which he had no time to examin the Reason, in regard his Thoughts were all employ'd how to save himself. After that we made a Re∣lation one to another of our past Adventures, while we staid to em∣bark in a Fisher-boat, like those of <HI>Marteguois,</HI> and so swift that it brought us to <HI>Santa Maria</HI> in four
<PB N="186" REF="108"/> days, from whence we held the same Course backward as we had done forward.</P>
<P>Returning through <HI>Athens</HI> I vi∣sited my Host <HI>Epiphanes,</HI> who re∣ceiv'd me with a great deal of joy, returning me a thousand thanks for the good Effects of my <HI>Antipo∣dagricon,</HI> finding himself absolute∣ly freed from the Tormenting pains of the Gout by the use of it. And I should have been much more glad to find my self so Instrumen∣tal in the Recovery of a Person from whom I had receiv'd so much kindness, had not my Joy been a∣bated by the news which I receiv'd at the same time of the death of <HI>Demetrius</HI> and <HI>Constantine.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Athens</HI> I had a design to have taken a Journey to <HI>Parnassus,</HI> but understanding I should see no∣thing but a Mountain, like to o∣ther Hills, with out any Footsteps
<PB N="187" REF="108"/> of Antiquity, I laid aside those thoughts. For I am not of the hu∣mour of many Men that put them∣selves to a great deal of trouble, meerly that they may be able to say they have been at such or such a place when mention'd in Company. If the Beauties of a Country do not draw me thither, there must be at least some remainder of those that formerly inhabited those Parts, whence I may in some mea∣sure understand the Fashions of Li∣ving, and Customs of a People whom History has represented to the World with Applause; nor is the knowledge of the Manners and Customs of the present Inhabi∣tants, able to make a Parallel be∣tween them and their ancestors un∣worthy a Man of Wit; and there∣fore above all things I flye to a place where once Learning flou∣rish'd. If a Traveller does not propose to himself these Advanta∣ges,
<PB N="188" REF="109"/> he will find himself often de∣ceiv'd, in regard he will not see the fourth part of what he expects, up∣on reading of Relations, no less flattering and deceitful than Paint∣ings, that generally represent Faces much fairer then they are; unless it be that a Man is desirous to know of himself the Situation of Places, which I have found to be very much mistaken in the best Maps.</P>
<P>From <HI>Athens</HI> we return'd to <HI>Na∣ples,</HI> whose delicious Climate con∣strain'd <HI>Monthresor</HI> to stop there. For my own part I return'd into <HI>France,</HI> where after I had experi∣mented all the Rigours of a Cruel Fortune, in the year 1676, I em∣bark'd at <HI>Rochel</HI> in an <HI>English</HI> Ves∣sel, which brought me to <HI>Plymouth</HI> the 28th. of <HI>September,</HI> having a desire to terminate my Travels and my days in this Kingdom. But the Enemy of my repose would suffer me to take no rest, having
<PB N="189" REF="109"/> found out new necessities for me to revisit as well <HI>France,</HI> as several o∣ther parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> through Roads not common, where I have made several Remarks, which I shall communicate to Publick view, when I understand what kind of entertainment this my first Volume has receiv'd: For nature not be∣ing wholly shut up in one small Corner, it behoves a Philosopher to sound for Experience in various Parts, which he cannot otherwise do than by Travelling; else the Company of Learned Men and rare Wits, which are in Kingdoms and Countries like so many <HI>Phoe∣nixes,</HI> is not to be acquir'd, but by a strict survey of those Kingdoms. And indeed by the means of these two assistances it was, that I found what I sought for in the Study of Philosophy, which of all the Stu∣dies I have labour'd in, even to the maintaining of General Theses, con∣cerning
<PB N="190" REF="110"/> all that could be known, is that which I have taken most de∣light in all my Life time for these thirty years together, that I have apply'd my self solely to it, re∣nouncing all the rest, excepting on∣ly Physick, which following like her Daughter so close at the heels, no less deserv'd my Courtship. Be∣sides that the exact knowledge of the Body of Man, which she promi∣ses her followers, making me hope that she would favour my designs of diving into the Secrets of Na∣ture, bred in me a strong Inclina∣tion from that time forward to ap∣ply my self devoutly to that Sci∣ence. And the Progress which I made both in the one and the o∣ther seem'd sufficient to my Friends to importune me to take the De∣gree of Doctor in both Faculties. Wherein I prov'd successful with all the Honour that an Honest Man could wish for, during a Win∣ter
<PB N="191" REF="110"/> that I sojourn'd at <HI>Padua,</HI> af∣ter I had undergone the utmost ri∣gours of a strict Examination both in Publick and Private. Nor was it less than I desir'd; tho' being in∣form'd of my Birth, they would have treated me more Nobly, that is to say, they would have pass'd me without Examination. Howe∣ver though I hold my self highly honour'd with these two Degrees, yet I do not pretend to value my self upon that of Physick; as be∣ing too mean and prostituted to the most ignorant in the <HI>Esculapian</HI> School, who arrive to be no more than bare Mountebanks; besides that the Faculty is extreamly decry'd by the Dishonour done it by idle and silly Practitioners. Neither do I practise it my self, as well to avoid the Reproaches to which a Physi∣cian is expos'd if he fail of success which often befals him, as for that my Constitution will not brook
<PB N="192" REF="111"/> that nastiness and stench, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Physician is forc'd to swallow for his Breakfast, when he comes to do his Duty; according to the Verse,
<Q>Stercus &amp; Ʋrina medici sunt prandia prima.</Q> To what purpose, then (will some ob∣ject) are all those noble Secrets which you have acquir'd in your Travels? What will become of your <HI>Pneu∣matopharmacon,</HI> that will create a Memory and Understanding in those that want it? that excellent Remedy against the Gravel, and that other which unfetters Gouty Feet, extirpating the Cause of the Distemper? To which I answer; these are Medicins which I give to such as think it worth their while to desire them, where I live at my House in <HI>Beaufort Buildings</HI> in the <HI>Strand,</HI> in the Court that goes from the <HI>Fountain Tavern</HI> to the Water-side.</P>
