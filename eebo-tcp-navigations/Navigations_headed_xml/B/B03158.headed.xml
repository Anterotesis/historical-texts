<HEAD>AN ELEGY On that Famous SEA-COMMANDER Michael De Ruyter, Lieutenant Admiral of the United Netherlands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> VVho lately Died of his Wounds, Received in the Engagement between the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Fleets near <HI>SICILY.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Praise is a Tribute each true Poet owes,</L>
<L>To <HI>Worth</HI> and <HI>Valour</HI> whereso'ere it grows.</L>
<L><HI>Mountains</HI> and <HI>Seas</HI> may bound the <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>Kings,</HI></L>
<L>But our <HI>Free Muse,</HI> with unconfined wings</L>
<L>Flies over both, those that Allegiance yield</L>
<L>To different States, are all her Subjects stil'd.</L>
<L>And though a Soul breaths not within our Isle,</L>
<L>That can more dearly Love its Native soil.</L>
<L>Yet when I look abroad, where'ere <HI>I Ken,</HI></L>
<L>The Good and Brave, they are my <HI>Countrymen.</HI></L>
<L>And shall <HI>De Ruyter</HI> Limp into a Grave</L>
<L>Without a <HI>Mourning Verse?</HI> No <HI>Poem</HI> have</L>
<L>T'Embalm his <HI>Fame,</HI> and let next Ages know,</L>
<L>How much they to his <HI>Great Example</HI> owe?</L>
<L>'Twere <HI>Moral Sacriledge,</HI> Nor can it be,</L>
<L>His generous Acts command an Elegy;</L>
<L>Say but <HI>De Ruyter</HI>'s Dead, The news transforms</L>
<L>Neptunes calm Face into a thousand Storms:</L>
<L>The sighing <HI>Winds</HI> his rigid Fate deplore,</L>
<L>And murmur his <HI>Lon'd Name</HI> to every shore,</L>
<L>which soon as heard, <HI>Seamen</HI> (though Enemies)</L>
<L>Cannot restrain the Torrents of their Eyes;</L>
<L>Even those that never wept before, strike Sail</L>
<L>To grief, and now the mighty Loss bewail;</L>
<L>His <HI>Loss!</HI> whose <HI>able Parts</HI> had many a year,</L>
<L>Been the <HI>Best Card</HI> by which <HI>Sailers</HI> could <HI>Steer;</HI></L>
<L>VVho solely by his <HI>ample Merits</HI> call,</L>
<L>Attain'd the Honour of an <HI>Admiral.</HI></L>
<L>VVho had so often <HI>Thetis</HI> bosom lain,</L>
<L>So long been us'd to Trace the <HI>Pathless Main;</HI></L>
<L>That <HI>Sea-nymphs welcom'd</HI> him where ere he came,</L>
<L>And every <HI>Dolphin</HI> knew him by his Name;</L>
<L>His <HI>Services</HI> were numerously <HI>Great,</HI></L>
<L>The <HI>Second Atlas</HI> of a mighty <HI>State;</HI></L>
<L>Prudent in <HI>Councels,</HI> and yet bold in <HI>War,</HI></L>
<L>To meet those dangers he <HI>fore saw</HI> a far:</L>
<L><HI>A well-poiz'd Valour,</HI> that would never shrink,</L>
<L>Neither beholden unto <HI>Oaths</HI> nor <HI>Drink;</HI></L>
<L>who in the height of <HI>Fight,</HI> and depth of <HI>slaughter</HI></L>
<L>(when all the world seem'd only <HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Water:</HI></L>
<L>And with a horrid Prospect gaping lay,</L>
<L>As if the <HI>Deluge,</HI> and the <HI>Latter day</HI></L>
<L>Had met, and mingled Forces to devour</L>
<L>The watry <HI>Warriours</HI> in one bloody hour)</L>
<L>Could <HI>fearless</HI> stand, and calm <HI>commands</HI> dispence</L>
<L>VVith <HI>present mind,</HI> and undisturbed sense:</L>
<L>His <HI>Conduct</HI> for his courage did not cease,</L>
<L>But with the Fury of the Fight <HI>Increase.</HI></L>
<L>VVhat pity tis those Valiant <HI>Hero</HI>'s, who</L>
<L>Can do such Acts, are not Immortal too</L>
<L>To live as his Eternal Fame must do.</L>
<L>Must do! whilst there shall last what <HI>men</HI> call days</L>
<L>Or <HI>Air</HI> to mould one syllable of <HI>Praise.</HI></L>
<L>So many fierce <HI>Engagements</HI> he had felt,</L>
<L>Reguarding <HI>Broadsides</HI> but as <HI>Pot-Gun</HI> Pelt.</L>
<L>VVe thought him <HI>woundless,</HI> till death made him Reel</L>
<L><HI>Achilles</HI> like, by nibling at his <HI>Heel;</HI></L>
<L>But as the <HI>Sun</HI> most glorious does appear,</L>
<L>And darts the brightest <HI>raies</HI> when's <HI>settings</HI> near.</L>
<L>So his last Scene of Life contracted all,</L>
<L>That we can great, or brave, and wondrous call.</L>
<L>For in his <HI>Countries Cause,</HI> he nobly Fell,</L>
<L>whilst <HI>Peals of Cannon</HI> Rung his <HI>Parsing Bell</HI></L>
<L>And <HI>Victory</HI> attended on his <HI>Knell.</HI></L>
<L>Thus Dy'd he as much <HI>Honour'd</HI> as he Liv'd,</L>
<L>For whom the <HI>Neitherlands</HI> are all so griev'd.</L>
<L>That they <HI>vie</HI> Lamentations without <HI>Pause,</HI></L>
<L>In a <HI>Vast Grief,</HI> next nothing but its <HI>Cause;</HI></L>
<L>A Grief! whose <HI>Sighs</HI> commanded by their love</L>
<L>Might line with <HI>Sables</HI> all the <HI>Orbs</HI> above.</L>
<L>And People Mourn so fast, That <HI>Holland</HI> fears'</L>
<L>A <HI>Second Inundation</HI> from their <HI>Tears.</HI></L>

<L>The Great <HI>De Ruyter</HI> bred in <HI>Neptunes</HI> Court,</L>
<L>Through many <HI>Storms</HI> has here attain'd his <HI>Port.</HI></L>
<L>A Grave-Stone is too small to hold his worth,</L>
<L>Posterity (if Just) must set it forth</L>
<L>what his <HI>Deeds</HI> were, and <HI>Conduct</HI> who not knows</L>
<L>Our <HI>Verse,</HI> Refers him to the <HI>Belgick Prose.</HI></L>
