Article of the said Treaty it was agreed, That the said Lord the King, and the said Lords the States General should be
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>and remain Friends, Confederates and Allyes, for the defending the Rights and Priviledges of each others Subjects, against all persons whatsoever, who should endeavour by Land or Sea to disturb the Peace of ei∣ther State, or who being Inhabitants in eithers Do∣minions should be declared Publick Enemies of either State: But yet no particular mention being there made of the Aids and Succours wherewith one Party should in such case be oblieged to assist the other; And as well the said King, as the said States General, resolving to strengthen and to bring yet to further perfection the said Agreements, have agreed in the first and principal place to confirm, as by these presents they do confirm, the said Treaty concluded at <HI>Breda,</HI> and the said Rules and Articles of Commerce thereto belonging, mutually obliging themselves to a sincere and perpe∣tual observation of them, and to cause them to be strictly and religiously observed and fulfilled by the Subjects on either side, according to the genuine sense and meaning of the said Treaty, and the Articles therein contained. And further for ascertaining the Succours to be mutually given, which was omitted in the said Treaty as aforesaid, as well to improve and encrease the Friendship that is between the said Lord the King, and the said Lords the States General, as for seasonably providing by a closer Union and Alliance for the mutual safety and defence of each State against the Hostile attempts and practices of whomsoever, and under what pretence soever, We whose names are underwritten, by vertue of the Pow∣ers and Commissions to Us granted, and which are to be inserted in the close hereof, have agreed and
<PB N="5" REF="3"/>concluded, That the said Lord the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and the said Lords the States General of the <HI>United Netherlands,</HI> shall be, and by vertue of these Presents they are mutually allied, united and confe∣derate in a perpetual Defensive League, on the Terms and Conditions following.</P>
