<HEAD>THE VOYAGES <HI>AND</HI> TRAVELS Of that Renowned Captain, Sir <HI>Francis Drake, <HI>INTO THE</HI></HI> VVEST-INDIES.</HEAD>
<P>SIR <HI>Francis Drake</HI> was born at <HI>Ipswich,</HI> and in his Youth put Apprentice to a Master of a Vessel, during which time he gave himself wholly to the study of Marin Affairs, and grew so perfect therein, that he in the end became the Worlds Wonder, the Nations Glory, and Terror to its Enemies; in demonstration of which, I shall declare his several Voyages and great Atchievements, till his Death.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="3"/>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Then he having by his many Exploits gained great Ap∣plause, and the Reputation of an able Sea-man, was made Captain of a small Vessel by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and imployed against the <HI>Spa∣niard,</HI> her Mortal Enemy, from whom he took divers Prizes near Home; But not so contented, he, on the <HI>24th.</HI> of <HI>May, 1572.</HI> set Sail in the <HI>Paschal of Plimouth,</HI> a Ship of <HI>70</HI> Tuns, and mount∣ed with <HI>10</HI> Guns, accompanyed with the <HI>Swan,</HI> a Ship of <HI>25</HI> Tuns, and <HI>8</HI> Guns, Commanded by his Brother <HI>John Drake:</HI> having on Board both the Vessels, <HI>73</HI> Men and Boys, with all other Necessa∣ries, and having a fair Wind, came to <HI>Guadalupa,</HI> one of the <HI>West-India</HI> Islands, on the <HI>29th.</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> but found nothing there, except some few Cottages made of Boughs, and covered with <HI>Palmata</HI> Leaves, which secured them from Rain, in the Nature of Tiles; yet they had sight of two <HI>Canows,</HI> but could not reach them, by reason the Calm was so great. These <HI>Canows</HI> are Boats which the <HI>Indians</HI> use, being for the most part cut out of Trees like Troughs, and a piece of Wood fixed on either side, to keep them from overturning; Whereupon, after they had watered their, they weighed Anchor, and Sailed to <HI>Port Phesant,</HI> so named, because of the abundance of that sort of Foul found there: and there going on Shoar, found that one Mr. <HI>Garret</HI> of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> had been lately there, and had left an Inscription in Lead nailed to a Tree, to warn him not to stay in that Port, forasmuch as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had notice of his Arrival; yet Landing more Forces, he resolved to stay and build a Pinnace, which he affected, fortifying the Port in the mean while, to prevent any surprize. And whilst they stayed there, a Bark came from the <HI>Isle of Wight,</HI> bringing in a <HI>Spanish</HI> Prize, which joyned with Captain <HI>Drake;</HI> So that having finished the Pinnace, the <HI>3</HI> Ships and Pinnace Sailed to the <HI>Isle of Pinos,</HI> where they found <HI>2 Spanish</HI> Ships of <HI>Nombre de Dois,</HI> Lading Timber by the <HI>Negroes.</HI> In those Vessels they were informed of the State of the City and Country, and that new Forces were dayly expected, to defend it against the <HI>Symerons,</HI> a Black People, with long Hair, who had Revolted from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by reason of their Cruelty, and since chosen themselves two Kings. Whereupon setting the <HI>Negroes</HI> on Shoar with some gifts, Captain <HI>Drake</HI> resolved to go to <HI>Nombre de Dois,</HI> which he entered by Night, beating the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="3"/> from their Defences, who hung Lines a thwart the East end of the Street, to make the <HI>English</HI> believe, by the lighted Matches tyed thereon, that their Forces were greater than indeed they were, and immediately Fired, which was answered with a like number of Fire-shot and Arrows from the <HI>English;</HI> they came to push of Pike, and butt end of the Musket, upon which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fled, and the King's Treasury consisting of <HI>360</HI> Tun of Silver Bars, and a like value of Gold, had fell into the hands of the <HI>English,</HI> had not Cap∣tain <HI>Drake</HI> been unfortunately wounded in the Leg, which caused the loss of so much Blood, that he fainted, yet nevertheless he per∣swaded his Men to persist, for that the like advantage could not be expected to be regained, if it was once omitted; but they prefering their Captain's Life before the Treasure, forced him on Ship-board. In this Battle only one <HI>English-man</HI> was killed, and three or four wounded by the Weapons the Enemy had cast away in their flight; several of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were killed, and taken Prisoners. But Captain <HI>Drake</HI> being now on Ship-board, and well perceiving the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had increased their Forces, thought it not convenient with so small a number, to make a second attempt, therefore taking a Vessel Laden with Wines, which at his coming he found in the Port; He set Sail for the Port <HI>Plenty,</HI> and there, by the advice of a <HI>Negro,</HI> Caressed the <HI>Symerons</HI> he found there, who being Mortal nemies to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> joyned Friendship with him, and greatly furthered his Affairs; and Sailing thence towards <HI>Cartagena,</HI> he took a great Ship Richly Laden, and after that, another, in which were two of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Kings <HI>Scrivendoes,</HI> who were sent from <HI>Nombre de Dois,</HI> with the News of what had happened there. Yet he acted not so secretly, but that his coming was known to the <HI>Car∣tagenians,</HI> who taking the Alarum, came down to the Shoar in great number, insomuch that <HI>Drake</HI> thought it no ways convenient to Land there: and that his Pinnaces might be the better Maned, he caused his great Ship to be sunk, after all things necessary were taken out of her, and Sailed from that Port, lying for some time undiscovered, about a League thence, and caused the <HI>Negroes</HI> to build a House, to shelter his Men from the violent Storms of Rain, that fell during his stay; To which place the <HI>Indians</HI> brought store of Water and Victuals, for which they were amply gratifyed.
<PB N="4" REF="4"/> At which place leaving one Ship, he, with the two Pinnaces, Sail∣ed to <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> where Roving up a great River, the Marriners were much afflicted with the insufferable stinging of Flyes, called <HI>Muskalos,</HI> against which there is no Remedy, but Iuice of Lemons, with which the skin being wet, they will not fasten. In the River he met two <HI>Indian Canows,</HI> in which were Fisher-men, but took no notice of them, for fear of being discovered, but passing for <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> the Captain and his Men came to a Store-house, on the Ri∣ver side, where he found great plenty of Provision, prepared for the Fleet that was about to return into <HI>Spain;</HI> after which, having notice that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were coming down, they returned to their Pinnaces, and soon after took five or six small Barks, Laden with Provision, setting the Men on Shoar, and so Sailed to the Country of the <HI>Syme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons,</HI> who kindly received them. These <HI>Symerons</HI> are a People Inhabiting between <HI>Cabezas,</HI> and <HI>Rio Piego,</HI> who by certain <HI>Negroes,</HI> were given to understand, That <HI>Drake</HI> came as a Friend, and would protect them against the attemp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the <HI>Spa∣niards;</HI> which caused them to admit the <HI>English</HI> to confer with them, and furnish them with such necessaries as they required; pro∣mising <HI>Drake,</HI> that as soon as the five Rainy Months were past, in which, <HI>Spaniards</HI> never carry their Treasure by Land, they would so order the matter, that he should make himself Master of much Gold. Whereupon he ordered them to build him six Houses, for sheltring his Men, which they did, as likewise with the help of the <HI>English,</HI> a Fort Triangle, which the Captain fortifyed to prevent any surprize; and leaving part of his Men there, Sailed amongst the pleasant Islands, in the River replinished with Gardens, and Delicious Fruits, where the <HI>Indians</HI> were at his Devotion, deliver∣ing up their Bows and Arrows, bringing Baskets of Fruit and Iuices in Bails, as an Oblation of these People. <HI>Drake</HI> inquired into the State of the Country, and then Sailed towards <HI>Charesha,</HI> and Anchored between the Island, and the Main-land, to defend which, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had lined the Shoar with Shot, Firing inces∣santly at the <HI>English,</HI> so that they were obliged to stand off, the Captain having one of his Men sore wounded; and next Morning took a Bark Laden with Provision and Sweet-meats, bound for <HI>Carlagena,</HI> setting all the Men on Shoar, except a <HI>Negro,</HI> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m
<PB N="5" REF="4"/> the Captain kept, to be by him, instructed in the Affairs of the Coun∣try, and Anchoring at the Mouth of the <HI>Haven</HI> of <HI>Carlagena,</HI> took two other Barks, which caused the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to send a <HI>Srivaneo</HI> with a Flag of Truce, who desired to be admitted on Board, which was accordingly granted; But <HI>Drake</HI> findi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> his Message was only to protract time, till the Forces came <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n to surprize him, would not accept of his Invitation on Shoar, which Treachery was soon apparent. For the <HI>Spaniards</HI> perceiving <HI>Drakes</HI> warriness, and that they could not get him within their reach by Land, sent two Ships of War to sight him by Sea, which he perceiving, went joy∣fully to encounter them: but after exchange of several shot, the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> finding their entertainment too warm, put themselves under the Protection of the Castle, and soon after came two other Pin∣naces, who fared no better then the former: Whereupon <HI>Drake</HI> Landed several of his Men, and drove the <HI>Spaniards</HI> from the Shoar, and for their safety, to betake themselves some to the Town, and othe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to a thick Wood standing close by; but Victuals growing scarce, he was obliged to stand away to <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> where a little before, he had found store of Provision, but now was frustrated in his expectation, for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had caused the Natives to retire to the Mountains, and carry with them all their Cattle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But at length meeting with several small Vessels, which he took, their want was in some measure supplyed, yet the scarcity caused a Sick∣ness to rage among the Marriners, but Providence so ordered it, that only one them Dyed.</P>
<P>The Sickness ended, <HI>Drake</HI> returned to the Fort, where he had left part of his Men, together with the <HI>Symerons,</HI> but upon his ar∣rival, to his great grief, found his Brother, and one <HI>Richard Allen,</HI> Dead of the Wounds they received in attempting to Board a <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Ship of considerable force. Nor was this all the loss, for <HI>Jo∣seph Drake,</HI> another of the Captains Brothers, soon after Dyed of a Calenture; yet he took Courage, and being supplyed by the <HI>Syme∣rons,</HI> he attended his better Fortune, and was soon after informed by those People (who like Grey-hounds ranged the Country to learn what they could) that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet was arrived at <HI>Nombre de Dois;</HI> whereupon <HI>Drake</HI> sent the <HI>Lyon</HI> Frigat to discry them, who upon her approaching that Port, fell in with a small <HI>Spanish</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="5"/> Vessel, Laden with <HI>Mace, Hens,</HI> and <HI>Pompions,</HI> from <HI>Tolon;</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> that were found therein, the Captain used courte∣ously, protecting them from the fury of the <HI>Symerons,</HI> who are Mor∣tal Enemies to the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>Vpon certain notice that the Fleet was arrived, <HI>Drake</HI> confered with the Native <HI>Symerons,</HI> about the Necessaries that were to be provided for the expedition, to surprize such Carriages of Gold and Silver, as were to come over-Land; who told him he must be well furnished with Weapons and Shooes, and that for the rest they would not be wanting; which being provided, <HI>48</HI> Men set forward, of which, <HI>30</HI> were <HI>Symerons,</HI> and the rest <HI>English;</HI> the former serving in∣stead of <HI>Sumpterers</HI> for carrying Provision, and when the store fail∣ed, they would range the Woods, and catch such Provision as they could, seldom missing to return without a Buck or Faun, or store of Foul, bearing about them many Arrows, headed with Iron, Wood, or Fishes Bones; which they will cast so dexterously, that they seldome miss the Iron, with which their Arrows are headed, and is frequently found to be more precious in their estimation, than Gold.</P>
<P>This March they continued over-Land through many thick Woods, from Sun-rise, till ten in the Morning, and then resting in watery places till four in the Afternoon, they walked till eight; and when Darkness came on, the <HI>Symerons</HI> laying aside their burthens, would cut down Boughs to build Harbours with, covering them to keep out the Rain, if any should fall, building them with <HI>Planata</HI> Leaves, decent-wise according to the Fashion of <HI>Norway</HI> Cottages; insomuch that no Rain would enter for the space of <HI>24</HI> hours; nor were they wanting to bring several sorts of Fruits, as <HI>Mammeas, Guyanas, Palmitos, Pinos, Oranges, Le∣mons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HI></P>
<P>After <HI>3</HI> days Travels, they came to a Town of <HI>Symerons,</HI> scituate on a Hill near a River, compassed with a Dike of eight foot broad, and a thick Mud-wall ten foot in heighth, containing one broad Street from East to West, and two cross Streets of a lesser breadth; all consisting of sixty Families, who in their Apparel, somewhat im∣mitated the <HI>Spaniards:</HI> This Town is distant from <HI>Nombre de Dois 35</HI> Leagues, and <HI>45</HI> from <HI>Panama,</HI> being sufficiently sto∣red
<PB N="7" REF="5"/> with all manner of plenty. As for their Religion, they have no Priests, yet they hold Crosses in great Veneration; but at the per∣swasion of the <HI>English,</HI> they layed their Crosses aside, and in some measure, embrace the Worship of the true God learning, the <HI>Lord's Prayer,</HI> and many other necessary Articles of Belief; they continually were upon their Guards, for fear of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who dayly molested them, aiming at the Subversion of that place, on which they had made several attempts, but without success, their Scouts upon the Frontiers continually giving notice of their approach, and so Allarumed their Neighbouring Towns, especially that wherein their King resided, in which were supposed to be <HI>1700</HI> Fighting Men; and fain would they have intreated the Captain to a longer residence amongst them, but he being intent on his Iourney, with many expressions of kindness took his leave, and so marching with four <HI>Symerons,</HI> who knew the way about a Mile before him, who by breaking off Boughs, and strewing them in the way, gave directions; and the other twenty four divided equally for his Vaunt-Guard, and Rear-Guard, the <HI>English</HI> continuing in the middle. After passing many Gloomy Woods, which sheltered them from the Suns hot Beams, they came to a great Hill, on which stood a high Tree, in which were cut several steps, that led to a pleasant Bower, scituate on the top, in which, ten or twelve Men might sit, and from thence take a view of the North and South <HI>Athantick</HI> Ocean; and from thence they passed on to a plain Champain Country, abounding in Grass so high, that the Inhabi∣tants are obliged to burn it twice or thrice a Year, to give their Catle advantage of feeding; through which they Travelled to <HI>Pa∣nama,</HI> and for fear of being discovered, struck through a Gloomy Grove, on the Right-hand, and at the edge thereof resting: they sent a <HI>Symeron</HI> disguised like a <HI>Negro,</HI> to <HI>Panama,</HI> to inquire what Night, for by Day they Travelled? not by reason of the heat of the Sun. The <HI>Recoes</HI> passed to <HI>Venta-Cruz,</HI> in order to their Pas∣sage to <HI>Nombre de Dois,</HI> to Land the Fleet, and by him, upon his return had notice, That that Night eight Moils Laden with Gold and Silver, and one with Iewels, together with fifty others Laden with Provisions and Merchandize, were to pass the Rode; where∣upon <HI>Drake,</HI> with his Men, and the <HI>Symerons,</HI> placed themselves
<PB N="8" REF="6"/> in the Grass, and thick Shrubs, near to the way side, in expectati∣on of the Rich Booty; The Truth of which, was likewise con∣firmed by a <HI>Spanish</HI> Souldier, taken by two <HI>Symerons,</HI> and brought to the Captain; and so placed themselves, that whilst one Party was seizing on the foremost Moils, the other might take the hindermost. And all things had succeeded to their wish, had not an <HI>English-man</HI> and a <HI>Symeron,</HI> though contrary to the strict command of the Cap∣tain, suddenly started out to seize a <HI>Cavelier</HI> coming from <HI>Venta-Cruz,</HI> who perceiving them by the <HI>English-man</HI>'s white Shirt, which he and the rest, had put over his Cloaths, the better to distin∣guish them if it should come to a skirmish, as in in all likelyhood it would, he suddenly put Spirs to his Horse, and out striped them: about a League distance meeting with the <HI>Recoes,</HI> he informed the Convoyers of what he had seen, telling them, That he was sure that either <HI>Drake,</HI> or some of his Men, lay in Ambush for them: So the <HI>Recoes,</HI> Laden with Gold and Silver, and Iewels, turned back again, and only that Laden with Provision, Merchandise, and a small quantity of Treasure, come forward, which was according∣ly taken, and declared the manner of the Prevention; imploring <HI>Drake</HI> to defend them from the rage of the <HI>Symerons.</HI></P>
<P>Matters being at this pass, it was not thought safe to stay long in those parts, but to return to the Ships, which they could not do, but by the tedious way they came, or by cutting their way through <HI>Venta-Cruz,</HI> the latter of which as less difficult. <HI>Drake</HI> resolved on, and therefore commanding his Men to refresh themselves, ask∣ed <HI>Pedro,</HI> Captain of the <HI>Symerons,</HI> whether he would stand by him or not? who answered, He would Dye at his Feet, e're he would leave him; and thereupon on they marched, till they cam near the Town, and there taking out of the <HI>Recoes</HI> what was best Porta∣ble, they turned back the Moiles and their Drivers, commanding them on pain of Death, not to follow them: and sentering the way, cut through a thick Wood, as thick as our <HI>English</HI> Hedges, they were incountered by a company of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> under the leading of a <HI>Convent Fryer;</HI> when after a hot skirmish (in which <HI>John Har∣ris,</HI> an <HI>English-man,</HI> and one <HI>Symeron,</HI> were killed, the <HI>Spani∣ards</HI> were put to flight, many of them being killed, wounded, and taken Prisoners; The <HI>Symerons</HI> at that time behaving them∣selves
<PB N="9" REF="6"/> valiently, doing with their Arrows, great Execution. But far they had not marched, e're the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who had retired, be∣ing reinforced, had fortifyed themselves in a Wood, by which the <HI>English</HI> must pass; into which Wood the <HI>Symerons</HI> in a Daun∣cing posture rushed, singing in their Tone, <HI>Yo-Peho, Yo-Peho,</HI> and with their Aroows, drove the poor <HI>Spaniards</HI> thence, with the loss of but one Man; who, wounded as he was, e're he Dyed, kil∣led two <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>The out-Guards beaten, those that remained in the Town, made but small resistance, so that the <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Symerons</HI> entering, found most of the Houses abondoned. This Town of <HI>Venta-Cruz,</HI> consists not of above fifty Houses, besides one Monastery, and a few Store-houses. Here likewise they found three <HI>Spanish</HI> Gentle∣women that had lately been delivered of Children, came some days before from <HI>Nombre de Dois;</HI> for that it had been observed, that no <HI>Spaniard,</HI> or <HI>White,</HI> had ever been delivered at the latter place, but that the Child soon after Dyed: But that being brought to Bed at <HI>Venta-Cruz,</HI> or any other place Adjacent, the Children came to maturity. In compassion to this, <HI>Drake</HI> strictly commanded, that neither his own Men, or the <HI>Symerons,</HI> should out-rage them: and so having set a Guard upon all the Passes, they took some small Pillage and departed, having first beaten back twelve Horse-men, who supposing them gone, came thither from <HI>Panama.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the chief ends, for which the Iourney was undertaken, be∣ing unluckily frustrated, <HI>Drake</HI> (after a tedious March, in which many of his Men had perished by hunger and thirst, had not the <HI>Sy∣merons</HI> proved their Purveyors) arrived to his Ships; those on Board, who before were in great heavyness for his absence, abun∣dantly rejoycing at his return; and so staying on board in the Ri∣ver <HI>Fortugos,</HI> for some time a consult was held, what Enterprize was next to be undertaken, in which the Opinion of <HI>Symerons</HI> was held necessary, as they who best knew the Country, and where the Treasure lay; who gave Council, that near a Town, called <HI>Veragna,</HI> lived one <HI>Senior Pezaro;</HI> who had formerly been Master to some of them, and whom for his cruelty, they had abandoned; And that this Man, in a strong Store-house, Guarded by <HI>100</HI> Slaves, had heaped up great Treasure, being Propriator of several
<PB N="10" REF="7"/> Rich Mines. This Advice pleased them, yet they was prevented at that time by another Advice; for one of the <HI>Frigats</HI> being abroad, had taken a small <HI>Spanish</HI> Prize, in which was a <HI>Genoway Pilot;</HI> The said <HI>Pilot,</HI> upon his being kindly intreated, informed <HI>Drake.</HI> That in the <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Nicaragua,</HI> lay a Vessel ready to depart, in which was a Million of Gold, and that by his knowledge of the Channel, if he might partake in the gains, he could bring him in un∣discovered, and that he might have time to dispatch his business e're the Town could be Allarum'd. Whereupon the Captain giving such of the <HI>Symerons</HI> (who were willing thereto) leave to depart, gifting them with many large gifts, he took the rest with their Cap∣tain on Board, and set Sail to seize on this so much desired Prize; But entering the Harbour, although it was yet Dark, he under∣stood by the Firing of several Chambers, which wer answered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> others a distance thence, that he was discovered, and the Wind rur <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ing against him, he thought it not fit to attempt any thing further in that matter. So returning to his Station, he met the <HI>Bear</HI> Frigat, a small Vessel that he had fitted up, who had taken a <HI>Spa∣nish</HI> Bark, Laden with twenty eight fat Hogs, two hundred Hens, and great store of Mace; which is a kind of a grain like Rice, and in it ten <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who informed him, That the Fleet was arri∣ved at <HI>Nombre de Dois,</HI> and that two Gallies were building there to waft them to and fro, but not yet Launched. Whereupon <HI>Drake</HI> feasting his Men in this manner on <HI>Easter-Day,</HI> which that Year fell on the twentieth of <HI>March,</HI> he resolved to attempt something on the Fleet, and weighing Anchor bore with the Wind, till at length they espied a small Vessel plying to the West-ward, which after some Sai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng, was discryed to be a <HI>French</HI> Vessel; whose Captain like∣wise supposing it was <HI>Drake,</HI> stood with him, and in a most submis∣sive manner, begged some fresh water, for that he had nothing but Wine and Sider on Board: the which, by reason of the hot wea∣ther, had much impaired the health of his Men; with which <HI>Dra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</HI> supplyed him, willing to stand with him to the next Port, which he accordingly did, making him there, a Present of a Case of Pistols, and a Guilt Scimeter, which he said had been the late King of <HI>Fran∣ce</HI>'s, who was killed in <HI>Just,</HI> with <HI>Monsieur de Gomery;</HI> in re∣q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ital of which, <HI>Drake</HI> gave him a Chain of Gold, and a further
<PB N="11" REF="7"/> supply of necessary Provision. So that in the end he was willing to accompany him in his Voyage, and take such part as should befal him; yet <HI>Drake</HI> not altogether satisfyed in his Fidelity, so divided either Nation, that it was not in the power of the <HI>French-men,</HI> if the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would, to have injured the <HI>English;</HI> and then sending for the <HI>Symeron</HI> Captain, he approved of what was done, and thereupon it was agreed, That twenty <HI>French,</HI> fifteen <HI>English,</HI> and a consider∣able number of <HI>Symerons,</HI> should pass over-Land, to intercept the <HI>Ricoe</HI> that were coming from <HI>Panama,</HI> to <HI>Nombre de Dois;</HI> when having gone seven Leagues, the Bells of the Camels, and Moiles, were heard, which made the <HI>Symerons</HI> rejoyce, assuring Captain <HI>Drake,</HI> that he should have more Gold and Silver, than he could dispose of, and so indeed it fortuned, for the <HI>Recoes</HI> being seiz∣ed, a R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch Booty appeared, but there being a Guard of forty <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> attending it, a hot dispute happened: but in the end, the <HI>Spa∣niards</HI> were put to flight, and the Gold and Silver unladed, and eve∣ry one took what he could conveniently carry; but scarce had they hid the rest, and entered the Wood, e're a great number of Horse and Foot came on, yet they kept their way, all escaping, except one <HI>Sy∣meron</HI> that was killed, and a <HI>French</HI> Souldier that was taken Prisoner, who being put to the Torture, confessed where the Gold was hid, the Conflict the <HI>French</HI> Captain, was dangerously wound∣ed: But what was most amazing, was that when they came to the Sea side, where the Pinnaces had order to attend them. They per∣ceived seven <HI>Spanish</HI> Pinnaces, which were sent to take the <HI>English</HI> Vessels, then but weakly Maned, whom <HI>Drake</HI> and the rest imagin∣ed to have executed their design; but taking courage, he resolved to make a raft of such Trees as were driven on Shoar and put to Sea, in order to seek his Vessels, which he occordingly put in practice, ac∣companyed with one <HI>English-man,</HI> two <HI>French-men,</HI> and two <HI>Sy∣merons,</HI> and with great joy, sound his Vessels safe, riding it out behind the Point; and in spight of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> according to his Promise, fetched off his Companions, when having refreshed them∣selves, they went to look for the hidden Treasure, but found as afore∣said, That the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> by the <HI>French</HI> Captain's Confession, had discovered it. Yet had they not searched so narrowly, but that they had left several Bars of Silver behind them, as also some Quoits
<PB N="12" REF="8"/> of Gold; but what troubled the <HI>French-men</HI> most, their Captain sore wounded as he was, fell into the hands of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> yet upon sharing the Booty equally amongst them and the <HI>English,</HI> they were comforted, especially upon the Arrival of one of their Companions, who had escaped the hands of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> Yet being desirous to depart into their own Country, they left the <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI> yet fearing the danger they might incur, by falling into the hands of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they repented their rashness, and lingered till <HI>Drake</HI> over-took them: when notice being had, that the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet Richly Laden were about to depart from <HI>Cartagena, Drake</HI> Sailed to the Mouth of the Harbour, and there droping his Anchor, braved them with all Streamers flying, and Flag astern, and took a Frigat of fifty Tuns, Laden with Provision, within sight of 'em, and not to be cumbered with the Men taken therein, set them on Shoar, and so without longer stay Sailed to <HI>Cabezas,</HI> having first burnt the Ship, that it might no more advantage the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>During <HI>Drake</HI>'s stay at <HI>Cabezas Pedro,</HI> the Captain of the <HI>Symerons</HI> importun'd him for certain Iron Instruments belong∣ing to Navigation, which he frankly gave him for the good service he had done him; further promising, that he would look out some Silk and Linnen for his Wife, not intending to hold any thing from him that he could conveniently spare. But whilst he was looking in his Chest, the <HI>Indian</HI> espyed the Scimeter, given him by the <HI>French</HI> Captain, and was greatly desirous of it, but being bashful himself, he gave another a Quoit of Gold to ask for it; and having his request granted, he gave <HI>Drake</HI> four Quoits of Gold in requital, saying, He would present it to his King, who would high∣ly promote him for such a present.</P>
<P>And now <HI>Drake</HI> being desirous to return into <HI>England,</HI> reward∣ed the <HI>Symerons</HI> with divers gifts, and after leave taken, though to the great grief of those <HI>Indians,</HI> who earnestly desired the compa∣ny of the <HI>English,</HI> they stood away to the Island that bespangled the Ocean, and coasting that tract, came to Cape St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> where they took two hundred and fifty Turtles, which they powdered and eat, as occasion required; and from thence Sailing North-west, af∣ter touching at several places, they, to the great joy of their Friends, who concluded them lost, arrived safe at <HI>Plimouth,</HI> on the <HI>9th.</HI> Day

<P>Departing from this Island, <HI>Drake</HI> took a small <HI>Spanish</HI> Fisher∣boat, conducted but with three Men only; and after that, Sailing under the <HI>Tropick Cancer,</HI> fell in with a <HI>Spanish Craval,</HI> which he took, and then Sailing to <HI>Cape Barbas,</HI> he there took another, though indifferently Laden with Provision; where having plenty of all things necessary he stayed a while, during which space, the Natives came down to view the <HI>English,</HI> bringing with them a <HI>Negro</HI> Woman half starved, with a Child at her Brest, offering her to Sail, but <HI>Drake</HI> would not Traffick for such Commodities; whereupon they brought Gums, and Amber greese, offering it for fresh water, which above all things is most scarce in that Country.

<P>Having thus far proceeded, they set the <HI>Spaniards</HI> on Shoar, and after triming their Ships, Sailed to <HI>Cape de Verde,</HI> and so C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urted <HI>Bomavista,</HI> falling in with the <HI>Isle of Mayo,</HI> Inhabited by t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and so touching at several Islands, came to St. <HI>Jago,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the South-West of which Island, they took a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Vessel, Laden with Wine, Woollen, and Linnen-Cloath, on its return fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Brazil;</HI> and in defiance of those on Land, Fired upon three or four <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f their T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wns, standing on the Sea-Coast.</P>

<P>From this Island, after having taken some of what it afforded, they stood away to the Coast of <HI>Brazil,</HI> but by contrary Winds, were kept out so long at Sea, that Provision grew scanty, and especially Water, which in that burning Climate was most requisit.

This Coast is Inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which made our Men hope for some Rich booty, nor were they deceived in their expectati∣on; for the first thing they happened on, was a Bark with forty odd Bars of Silver, and soon after another Laden with Linnen, and so Sailed to <HI>Lima,</HI> 12 Degrees, 30 Minuets South Latitude, where they Anchored, although in the Harbour, were 30 <HI>Spanish</HI> Wessels, Boarding a Vessel that had in her 15000 Bars of Silver, of which, and some other Commodities found there, they ea∣sed her; And having notice of a Rich Ship, bound for <HI>Panama,</HI> they set Sail, and falling with <HI>Francisco,</HI> about Noun they discovered her, and bearing up without resistance, Boarded her, finding in her Fruits, Conserves, Sugars, and a great quantity of Iewels, 13 Chests of Plate Rial, 80 <HI>l.</HI> weight of Gold, and 26 Tun of uncoyned Silver, valued at 360000 Pezoes, for which they on∣ly gave the Master a little Linnen in exchange, which he took, supposing that better than nothing, as well knowing <HI>Drake</HI> would be his own Carver.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="12"/>
<P>Sailing from thence one Degree, North Latitude, they met with a Ship Laden with Linnen, China Dishes: and besides, found in it a <HI>Falcon,</HI> with a great Emrald in its Breast, which they took, and so passed by the Port of <HI>Pa∣pagaia,</HI> and divers dangerous Gulphs, continually sending forth violent Winds. And entering the Port of <HI>Gualulio,</HI> Inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> they furnished them with all things necessary, and compounded for their safety, with a Pot of <HI>Riats,</HI> as big as a Bushel, a Gold Chain, and a Iewel; whence Sailing 5<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Leagues, they came under sixty Degrees North Latitude, where, although it was about the middle of <HI>June,</HI> they were so afflicted with cold, that they were obliged to haste thence, to save their Lives, all the Coun∣tries round being covered with Snow, and the Seas with Globes of Ice; so that falling South-ward to thirty eight Degrees, the Weather was very temperate, where bearing with the Land, the Narives sent a Man in a <HI>Can∣now,</HI> to invite them on Shoar, who made a long Oration in his own Country Language, and by his Gestures, expressed his meaning, and being dismissed, he came again; and the third time bringing presents of Estrich Feathers, which none but those about their Kingdom are suffered to wear, he brought also a Baoket filled with Herbs, called <HI>Taback,</HI> in requital of which, <HI>Drake</HI> preffered him many things, but he would receive nothing but a Har.</P>

Who no sooner perceiving the <HI>English</HI> come forth of their Ships, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut they came down with great haste from a Hill, and fell down at their feet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orshiping them as Gods, throwing away their Bows and Arrows, and made many Laments and Cryes.</P>
<P>These People <HI>Drake</HI> treated courteously, bestowing shirts, and other things upon them, wherewith to cover their nakedness; signifying unto them, that he was but a Man, and that all his Company were Mortals, and no Gods, as these poor deluded people supposed them to be: to the belief of which they could hardly perswade them. In Recompence of what they had received, they bestowed upon the <HI>English,</HI> Caws, Quivers of their Arrows, and the like; and so with joy, which they expressed by their leaping and dancing, they departed to their Houses, which are digged round in their Earth, having chefts of Wood set up and joyned close at the top, like a Spire without Chim∣neys. Their Door is like an ordinary Scurle in a Ship stop-wise; their Men for the most part go naked, being of a loving and tractable Nature: their only Weapons are Bows and Arrows, with which, though they are skilful, they do but little Execution, they being of no force: their Women make themselves loose Garments of Bulrushes, to cover their secrets, wear∣ing on their shoulders Beasts skins, being altogether obedient to their Hus∣bands.</P>
<P>Two days after, a great multitude of them came down to the Tent, leav∣ing their Women and Bows some distance behind them, upon a Hill; who as soon as they were arrived at the Tent, fell to scratching their Faces, and casting themselves upon the Ground, with lamentable Cryes, as they use to do when they offer sacrafice to their Gods, not being yet perswaded but that the <HI>English</HI> were such, though <HI>Drake</HI> and his Company endeavoured to unde∣ceive them, with pointing towards Heaven Praying, and singing Psalms.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="12"/>
<P>Three days after their King came down, attended by a great number, who sung in a lamentable Tone about him; before him one bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a Scepter, made of Black Wood, about a Yard and half long, whereon hanged three Crowns, two Chains, and a bag or a Herb, called <HI>Tabak;</HI> the King had on a Caul of Net-work, resembling a Crown on his shoulders, to his waste a Coat of Coney skins; his Guards had Coats of other skins, and Cauls with Fea∣thers in them, of div rs Colours or covered with Down, which groweth on a Herb like a Lettice: which Down is not permitted to be worn, but by those about the King, the seed of it is only used in Sacrifice to their Gods. The common sort were for the most part naked, with long hair, tyed with bunches of Feathers, every one having their faces painted. Lastly, The Women came with Baskets on their Arms, made of Rushes, so closely Woven, that they would hold Water, being hanged with Pearl shells, and other shells, and with two or three links in a Chain, signifying they were Vessels Dedi∣cated to their Gods. When they came near, he that bore the Scepter, made an Oration for the space of half an Hour, which ended with a general <HI>Amen,</HI> and all (save the Children) came down the Hill.</P>
<P>Being come near he that bore the Scepter, with a stately Carriage began a Song, and a Daunce as also did the King, and all the rest (save the Women) who daunced, but did not sing. Which ended, they entered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Tent, where the King caused his Crown to be set upon <HI>Drake</HI>'s Head, desiring him, which by many signs he made, to take upon him the Kingdom, saluting him by the Name of <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oh</HI> ending the solemnity with a Song and a Daunce, which <HI>Drake</HI> received, to the behoof of Her Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esty. Whenas the common people leaving the King with <HI>Drake,</HI> went amongst the rest of the <HI>English,</HI> and finding such as pleased their Fancies, which were commonly the youngest, and most beau∣tiful, they inclosed them round, and offered sacrifices to them, crying with lamentable shr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cks, weeping, scratching, and tearing the flesh from off their Faces.</P>
<P>This Country a bounding with all things necessary for the use of Man, <HI>Drake</HI> named <HI>Albion,</HI> and at his departure, set up Her Majesties picture and Title to the Kingdom.

<P>The Country thus Allarumed, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in great numbers run to their Arms, but durst attempt nothing; so that the General commanded <HI>Praie</HI> to be burnt, which so perplexed the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that they resolved to compound for <HI>Domingo,</HI> and St. <HI>Jago;</HI> but whilst the Treaty was in hand, the <HI>English</HI> had withdrawn themselves out of <HI>Domingo,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fortified it, planting Ca∣nons in the Gate, and laying an Ambascade. Whereupon <HI>Drake</HI>'s 1200. Men, went to force the Guard, which accordingly they did, making great slaughter of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> so that they fled to the Castle; but fear so far prevailed with them, that they stayed not long there, but fled; upon which the Town being gained, a <HI>Negro</HI> Boy was sent to such <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as were retired to the Moun∣tains, with a Flag of Truce, giving them leave to return in safety. But as he was going, he was run through by a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> which so inraged the Gene∣ral, that he caused two <HI>Fryars</HI> to be carryed to the same place, and there hang∣ed; protesting, that unless the Murtherer was delivered up, he would hang two Prisoners every day, till none was left: which Mennace so troubled the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that they delivered up the Murtherer to Iustice, who according to his deserts was Executed.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> not coming to agreement for their City and Town, <HI>Drake</HI> gave order to Fire them, but being most stone building, it proved a task very difficult; yet the <HI>Spaniards</HI> desirous to preserve them, offered 25<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>0.

<P>From this Island they put over to the Main Land, and came within sight of <HI>Cartegena,</HI> when Landing about four in the Afternoon, Lieutenant General <HI>Carlile</HI> about Mid-night, came before the City, having put a Party of <HI>Spanish</HI> Horse to flight by the way; whilst the Vessels in the Read, attacked a small Fort that stood on the Sea Coast.

<P>The City thus won, the Ioy was not great, by reason of a Mortal Di¦stemper that raged amongst the Soldiers, occasioned by ill Airs, which kil¦led a great many of them, and caused so<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to lose their Wits, which utterly frustrated the Design upon <HI>No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ois,</HI> and <HI>Panama,</HI> where al the Trea∣sure was.
