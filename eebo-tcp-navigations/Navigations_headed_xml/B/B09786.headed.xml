<HEAD><HI>Prince Butler</HI>'s QUERICAL DEMONSTRATIONS Relating to The East-India Trade. Part II.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. SInce some very good Friends, of both <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New Stocks,</HI> are endeavouring, by all honest ways, together, to joyn, and in order thereto, are <HI>Writing, Pleading,</HI> and <HI>Printing</HI> their Cases; and since <HI>Losers</HI> have always the Liberty to speak, why may not I as well <HI>Print</HI> and <HI>Plead</HI> my Case; For I am sure I have as much, <HI>nay more</HI> reason to do it than they?</P>
<P N="2">2. If these two contending <HI>Stocks</HI> be made one, and the <HI>English Manufacturers</HI> Case be not taken some care of, I can, without Star-gazing, plainly foresee, That they, and some <HI>other Folks,</HI> soon <HI>Ruin'd</HI> will be; And therefore pray, Mind what I say; If not for their sakes, for your own, be pleas'd to take care on't.</P>
<P N="3">3. Is it not much more demonstrable, That the <HI>East-India</HI> Trade is of greater advantage to <HI>England</HI> than 'twas two Years ago; For since that time, it has in a great measure Ruined the <HI>Canterbury Silk Trade,</HI> and obliged most of the <HI>London Silk Weavers, Throwsters,</HI> &amp;c. to give over their several Trades and Employments?</P>
<P N="4">4. Will not this be of great Advantage to all the <HI>Clothing Counties</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> because some of these poor People, rather than starve, are gone to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and set up Trade there; others fall'n to <HI>Comb, Card,</HI> and <HI>Spin;</HI> make <HI>Cloths; Stuffs</HI> and <HI>Serges;</HI> who being at the Principal Mar∣ket, can make and sell them as well, or better, than the Country Weaver and Clothier can do?</P>
<P N="5">5. Does not Sir <HI>Jos. Child,</HI> who is well known to be Skilful in Trade, prove plainly, That the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Discourse of Trade. <HI>The Pre∣face.</HI></NOTE> <HI>East-India</HI> Trade ought to be greatly Encouraged, when he tells us in Print, That <HI>the Expence of Foreign Commodities, especially Foreign Manufactures, is the worst Expence a Nation can be inclinable to, and ought to be prevented as much as possible?</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Has not the <HI>Author</HI> of the Essay on the <HI>E. India Trade,</HI> as sufficiently proved it Gainful, not <NOTE PLACE="marg">Essay on the <HI>East-India Trade</HI> page 14.</NOTE> only to us, but all <HI>Europe,</HI> when he tells us, <HI>They had been Richer by a full Third than they now are, if that Trade had never been Discovered or Undertaken; and that it bears hard only upon those Countries that Consume those Commodities?</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Is it not plain, That it bears not hard upon <HI>England,</HI> since it could never be proved (and I <HI>challenge</HI> any now to do it) That we Consume at <HI>Home,</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> or our <HI>Plantations,</HI> above nine parts in ten: Or that in Foreign Parts (except our Plantations, <HI>&amp;c)</HI> there are Consumed above one eighth part of the <HI>Wrought Silks, Bengals,</HI> and <HI>Printed Callicoes?</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Since 'tis allowed this Trade is hurtful to <HI>Europe,</HI> and all are agreed in a General Peace, What if they should agree to Banish it out of all their Dominions? But if not, Why should we restrain any part, Since <HI>we have nothing from thence of solid Use,</HI> (but) <HI>Materials for Luxury, and</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 12.</NOTE> <HI>perishable Commodities, for our Gold and Silver, which is there buried,</HI> as the same <HI>Author</HI> tells us?</P>
<P N="9">9. Is it not better we should be at four or five hundred thousand Pounds Charge <HI>per An.</HI> for <HI>In∣dian Vanities,</HI> having such plenty of Money, than for the sake of imploying our own <HI>Poor,</HI> upon our own <HI>Wooll,</HI> disoblige several <HI>Maids</HI> and their <HI>Mistresses,</HI> who would then be at a loss how to Dress up <HI>themselves,</HI> their <HI>Chambers, Parlours,</HI> and <HI>Closets?</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. Is it not our Interest (as the Essayer tells us) to wear these <HI>Indian</HI> Manufactures, because they would soon bring down the price of our own so low, <HI>That we may Export them to all Foreign</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 29.</NOTE> <HI>Markets, and be able to under sell all Nations;</HI> For (surely) they neither can, or will ever think of falling in their Prices as we do.</P>
<P N="11">11. Or if they should, rather than leave off and <HI>starve,</HI> sell their Commodities as cheap as we, Pray what shall we get by this <HI>Learned Advice,</HI> since, after all, our Reducing the <HI>Indian,</HI> that Work for a Peny a Day, will out do us all, unless we're resolv'd to Work as Cheap, or Cheaper than they?</P>
<P N="12">12. Will not the Falling the Prices reduce the Wages of the <HI>Poor,</HI> and by that means make the Nation grow <HI>Rich,</HI> since Sir <HI>Jos. Child</HI> has very well observed, <HI>That where ever Wages are high,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Preface.</NOTE> <HI>throughout the whole World, it is an</HI> infallible <HI>Evidence of the Riches of that Country; And where Wages for Labour runs low, 'tis a proof of the Poverty of that Place?</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. But if bringing down the Prices will be such an Advantage, Why may we not as well send for the <HI>Corn</HI> we spend to the <HI>East Country,</HI> for theirs is much cheaper than ours? And then we may send our own <HI>Corn</HI> with our own <HI>Cloth,</HI> &amp;c. to seek Abroad for a Market; Would not this soon Raise the Value of all the <HI>Rents</HI> and <HI>Lands</HI> in <HI>England?</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. And to save yet the more, employ the <HI>Dutch Shipping,</HI> for they always Sail much cheaper than we do, and then we may send our own <HI>Ships</HI> to all Foreign Nations, that either want, or will hire them, or else save the Building of more, to the much greater Preservation of both our <HI>Seamen</HI> and <HI>Timber?</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. And if nought but cheap Working will vend our Commodities, let's to't in good earnest, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Page 27.</NOTE> and Employ the <HI>Twelve hundred Thousand</HI> which the Essay tells us receives Alms, which by the way is a very great Number, and shews how much we want the <HI>poor Indians</HI> to Work for us, and they sure
<PB REF="2"/> will bring down the Prices so low, that when our Money is gone, the <HI>Indians</HI> will take some <HI>Stuffs</HI> for their <HI>Callicoes.</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. What if the <HI>Landed Men</HI> should apprehend, that this would <HI>Begger</HI> their <HI>Tenants,</HI> and <HI>Fall</HI> all their <HI>Rents,</HI> Can't we by another <HI>Essay,</HI> with <HI>Rhetorical Flourishes,</HI> amuse them, and then by <HI>imaginary,</HI> or <HI>fabulous</HI> Computation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> prove this cannot be; Or that 'tis our <HI>Interest</HI> it should be so, rather than restrain the <HI>East-India</HI> Trade?</P>
<P N="17">17. Has not this Nation been great Gainers for many Years by the use of <HI>Muslings</HI> and <HI>Calli∣coes,</HI> which are worn in the room of <HI>German Linnens, Silesia Cambricks,</HI> and <HI>Lawns?</HI> For the first we have had for our <HI>Money</HI> and <HI>Bullion:</HI> The last were the Return of our own <HI>Woollen Mann∣factures,</HI> which now we can keep for our own use at Home.</P>
<P N="18">18. Were not the <HI>Silesians</HI> very great <HI>Fools,</HI> when we would not take off their <HI>Cambricks</HI> and <HI>Lawns,</HI> to set up the making of <HI>Woollen,</HI> with which they now supply both themselves and their Neighbours; Whereas we could yet have very well served them both for their <HI>Money?</HI> And may not some others soon follow such <HI>foolish</HI> Examples?</P>
<P N="19">19. If the <HI>Parliament</HI> would be so kind as to take off the Duty from course <HI>Callicoes,</HI> which be∣ing from twenty to fifty <HI>per Cent.</HI> is a very great Clog upon them; We could then also soon beat them out of most of the rest of their <HI>Linnens,</HI> which might be as much more for the <HI>Profit</HI> and <HI>Gain</HI> of this Kingdom.</P>
<P N="20">20. But if this will lessen the <HI>Customs,</HI> we're content they should double the Duties on all Wrought Silks; for they may well bear about 25 <HI>per Cent.</HI> And being such <HI>Bulky Commodities,</HI> sure none will Run them to save such small Customs, or the Ladies wear them when they'll be so dear: And will not this please the <HI>Clamorous Silk Weavers?</HI></P>
<P N="21">21. Or if they <HI>complain</HI> still, Can any one think the <HI>Parliament</HI> may not have some regard to so considerable a Company of <HI>poor Manufacturers</HI> as they are? When as, with no very great <HI>dif∣ficulty,</HI> they lately pass'd an Act for <HI>Relief</HI> and <HI>Support</HI> of the <HI>Hair</HI> and <HI>Silk</HI> Button-Makers?</P>
<P N="22">22. If the <HI>East India</HI> Company had Imported these Commodities, would it not have been easier for these <HI>Button Makers</HI> to have gained their Bill? And since the <HI>Parliament</HI> have past an Act in fa∣vour of the <HI>Trimmings,</HI> may they not in time do as much for the Principal Parts of the <HI>Garments?</HI></P>
<P N="23">23. And now to conclude: To your selves be so <HI>kind,</HI> These Quericals <HI>mind,</HI> For they are <HI>design'd,</HI> To inform all <HI>Mankind,</HI> So as Truth they may <HI>find,</HI> If <HI>not</HI> wilfully <HI>Blind:</HI> But whosoe'r by private Interest is <HI>sway'd,</HI> Or Money have <HI>paid,</HI> To the <HI>East-India Aid,</HI> I am very much <HI>afraid,</HI> That for all I have <HI>said,</HI> They will me <HI>upbraid,</HI> And cry out <HI>I am Mad.</HI></P>
<P N="24">24. But if they do, I must tell them <HI>plain,</HI> I find in my <HI>Brain,</HI> So much Sense still <HI>remain,</HI> As the Cause I'll <HI>maintain,</HI> 'Gainst them and their <HI>Train:</HI> Therefore don't <HI>disdain,</HI> My Queri∣cal <HI>Strain,</HI> And I shall <HI>remain,</HI> Your Friend as <HI>before,</HI> To stand at your <HI>Door,</HI> To plead for the <HI>Poor,</HI> And have yet in <HI>store,</HI> Of such Quericals <HI>more,</HI> At least a whole <HI>Score:</HI> Which you may have when you please.</P>
