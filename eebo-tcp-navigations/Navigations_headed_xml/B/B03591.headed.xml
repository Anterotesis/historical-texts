<HEAD>GEMITUS &amp; TRIUMPHUS. <HI>A Dream.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Upon the much lamented Death of <HI>WILLIAM</HI> late Lord Archbishop of <HI>CANTERBURY.</HI> By <HI>Peter Gleane,</HI> Gent.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LAte as I lay with surging Cares opprest,</L>
<L>The rude Invaders of my placid Rest,</L>
<L>I begg'd an Interval but to retire,</L>
<L>To Fuel up my languid vital Fire:</L>
<L>But stubborn Care, reluctant Care, denies</L>
<L>Rest to my Soul, and Slumber to my Eyes.</L>
<L>At last, when quite fatigued, I stole away;</L>
<L>Nor could this noisy Tumult make me stay;</L>
<L>'Tis true it kept my grosser Shell of Clay,</L>
<L>But the immortal Watcher of that Frame,</L>
<L>Always awake, always the same,</L>
<L>Was swiftly towring on the rapid Wing</L>
<L>Of soom good Daemon, some celestial Thing;</L>
<L>Such as those airy Emissaries be,</L>
<L>That with young Prophets talk in Extasie.</L>
<L>This airy Charioteer wasted me even</L>
<L>Where good Mens Souls they say embarque for Heaven;</L>
<L>Where, when my labouring Thoughts I could recount,</L>
<L>I found my self on th' top of <HI>Pisga</HI>'s Mount;</L>
<L>Where, looking round about, as I did stand</L>
<L>Pleas'd with the Landskip of the happy and,</L>
<L>I saw (methought) a Reverend Matron set</L>
<L>Wearing the Symptoms of Disconsolate,</L>
<L>Yet still comply'd with her sinister Fate;</L>
<L>Not once she utter'd a reluctant moan,</L>
<L>Yet I observ'd she in a modest Tone</L>
<L>More than once repeated, <HI>He is gone.</HI></L>
<L>Yet with that Constancy, that humble Sense,</L>
<L>She never once betray'd her Patience.</L>
<L>The whilst a wat'ry Deluge drowns my Eyes,</L>
<L>Whilst my relenting Soul did sympathise,</L>
<L>My Pity equal to her Grief did rise,</L>
<L>Zealous to know and ease her Miseries.</L>
<L>And whilst my anxious Thoughts were thus employ'd,</L>
<L>With elevated Hands and Eyes she cry'd,</L>
<L><HI>Eripe heu miseram;</HI> another Word</L>
<L>She added, which could not be understood</L>
<L>By me; who, all this while, stood ignorant</L>
<L>Of the mysteriousness of this Complaint.</L>
<L>Conscious at last that I should seem to be</L>
<L>Lost in the Practice of Humanity,</L>
<L>And by a slow supine omission Sin,</L>
<L>I resolutely threatned to begin</L>
<L>To ask the Cause of all these Signs of Grief,</L>
<L>The better to proportion some Relief.</L>
<L>Then trembling I approach'd, so as we see</L>
<L>Strangers address themselves to Majesty,</L>
<L>And stooping too one Knee, because I knew</L>
<L>That Posture to her Reverence was due:</L>
<L>Lady, (says I) If this unbyass'd Breast</L>
<L>May be with so Divine a Secret blest,</L>
<L>Suspend your Grief a while, and let me know</L>
<L>From what black Radix all this Sorrow grow,</L>
<L>Undraw the Tragick Curtain of your woe.</L>
<L>Let me in your Calamities pertake,</L>
<L>That which makes you sad, may me happy make,</L>
<L>And to th'Unfortunate it is we know</L>
<L>Comfort, to have Confederates in woe.</L>
<L>So 'twill me happy make, if I may be</L>
<L>An Instrument to ease your Misery:</L>
<L>And sure if in my Sphere it lies I'le do't,</L>
<L>I'le ransack every dark Recess throughout,</L>
<L>But that I'le find the hidden Mischief out.</L>
<L>And thenâ€” But here she stopt me, Silence brake,</L>
<L>And very Gravely, like her self she spake:</L>
<L>Enough, (tender young Man) enough, I see</L>
<L>A Specimen of Christian Love in thee.</L>
<L>Wipe off those useless Tears, my Loss is by</L>
<L>An indispensable Necessity:</L>
<L>Therefore your Consolations pray retain,</L>
<L>They're kind-indeed, yet but to me in vain;</L>
<L>Yet here I think you only have betray'd</L>
<L>How much your Love exceeds your Power to aid.</L>
<L>'Twas not (young Man) from any mortal Arm,</L>
<L>Or humane Violence, my Sorrow came,</L>
<L>And therefore 'twere Prophane for to believe</L>
<L>That humane Powers are able to relieve:</L>
<L>Death is the Cause, that Providential Rod,</L>
<L>That fatal Executioner of God,</L>
<L>He has bereav'd me of my Eldest Son;</L>
<L>Alas! he's gone! (wringing her hands) he's gone!</L>
<L>My Son, my Father, Friend or what can be</L>
<L>Nearer in Love, or Consanguinity?</L>
<L>For since my Lord and Husband spilt his Blood,</L>
<L>He has the surest and the firmest stood</L>
<L>To all my Customs, and Prerogatives,</L>
<L>Whilst I a Mute in helpless Widdow-hood.</L>
<L>And for my sake has undergone of late</L>
<L>The heavy Censures of an angry State:</L>
<L>Yet he; good, patient, he; easily retir'd,</L>
<L>For 'twas a Solitude that he desir'd.</L>
<L>I follow'd him, there lovingly we sat,</L>
<L>Nor envy'd Monarchs in our safe retreat;</L>
<L>Though some I know vainly believ'd that I</L>
<L>Had left him too in this Catastrophy,</L>
<L>Because that look'd like humane Constancy:</L>
<L>No, there I left the Torrent, 'cause before</L>
<L>I ne're Allegiance to th' Custom swore:</L>
<L>No Scene of fresher Troubles did arise,</L>
<L>But I consorted in his Miseries.</L>
<L>When tied to th' last Confinement of his Bed,</L>
<L>With tender Palms I press'd his dying Head.</L>
<PB REF="2" MS="y"/>
<L>Watching the languid Motions of his Eyes,</L>
<L>As th'Indian does the Occidental Skies.</L>
<L>Though I was sure my setting Sun should rise,</L>
<L>Fetching a dying Sigh, and that must be</L>
<L>Not 'cause he left the Churlish World, but me.</L>
<L>His Pious Soul thus glanced without strife</L>
<L>Out of his Mouth, that Sally-port of Life:</L>
<L>After I'd seen him this last Tribute pay,</L>
<L>I kiss'd his frigid Lips, and came away,</L>
<L>Leaving th' exhausted Magazine of Breath</L>
<L>T'adorn the Triumphs of insulting Death;</L>
<L>And to this Mount my swift Courier did tend,</L>
<L>Where good Mens Genius's to Heaven ascend.</L>
<L>And here I wait assuredly to see</L>
<L>Him on his Voyage to Eternity.</L>
<L>His thinner Substance stem the wat'ry Clouds,</L>
<L>Marching along in the Celestial Roads</L>
<L>Till to the blest <HI>Empyreum</HI>â€”</L>
<L>But here she broke abruptly off, and gaz'd</L>
<L>About, with Arms stretch out, like one amaz'd;</L>
<L>I fearing some Alarm turn'd me round,</L>
<L>For now I heard a noise of Trumpets sound,</L>
<L>And vocal Acclamations from on high,</L>
<L>Which shook the Architecture of the Sky:</L>
<L>And still descending nearer unto us,</L>
<L>Grew more articulate, and harmonious.</L>
<L>At last a Hurricane drew back a Cloud,</L>
<L>Which did before the Royal Prospect shroud:</L>
<L>When from behind appear'd a num'rous throng</L>
<L>That to th' aetherial Mansions did belong,</L>
<L>Who in a Consort, <HI>Io Poean</HI> sung.</L>
<L>Whilst the Seraphick Choristers throughout</L>
<L>Their sweeter Hallelujahs echo out.</L>
<L>Some rode in Chariots wrapt in Fiery Gowns,</L>
<L>None but wore Coronets, and some had Crowns;</L>
<L>Myriads of lesser Cherubs seem'd to sport</L>
<L>Those little Out-guards of th' aetherial Court;</L>
<L>The Sun his busy Rays the while employs</L>
<L>To guild the craggy Meteors of the Skies;</L>
<L>And all the new accomplish'd Scene to dress,</L>
<L>To entertain the now approaching Guest;</L>
<L>Whom in a Chariot then I chanc'd to spy</L>
<L>Rising afar off in the low hung Sky,</L>
<L>As from the Ocean: So in a Scallop rode</L>
<L>The Azure <HI>Thetis,</HI> with her marine God.</L>
<L>Yonder your Heroe comes, (Matron) I cry'd,</L>
<L>See, see, he does in active Triumph ride,</L>
<L>Whilst his Retinue flies he drives in haste,</L>
<L>Nor ever furious Jehu drove so fast;</L>
<L>I spy'd on's Chariot, though with wonder smitten,</L>
<L><HI>Æ²ltra militiam triumphanti</HI> written.</L>
<L>At last the two Retinues did unite,</L>
<L>Shouting as when two Royal Armies meet.</L>
<L>I fear'd this loud Concussion, I confess,</L>
<L>Had crackt the Machine of the Universe;</L>
<L>And heard a Voice shriller than all the rest,</L>
<L>In which three times distinctly was exprest,</L>
<L><HI>Euge bone serve!</HI> &amp;c.â€”</L>
<L>And then 'twas Echo'd loudly by the rest.</L>
<L>So marching on they disappear'd streight,</L>
<L>And distance drew a Veil before my sight.</L>
<L>Sure with such Equipage ne're Consul came</L>
<L>To make his pompous Ent'ry into <HI>Rome.</HI></L>
<L>In such a Chariot ne're was Consul drove</L>
<L>Up to the <HI>Roman</HI> Capitol of Jove:</L>
<L>Ne're with such pointed Glories did Romance</L>
<L>Adorn the Nuptials of an earthly Prince:</L>
<L>And whilst my Thoughts with such Encomiums swell'd,</L>
<L>Thus spake the Matron. Now you have beheld</L>
<L>(Young Man) the glorious Triumphs of my Son,</L>
<L>You think (I warrant) all is past and gon;</L>
<L>No, more illustrious Glories are to come,</L>
<L>What you have seen 's but the Preludium:</L>
<L>He that was late so servilely enstall'd</L>
<L>Is now a Saint going to be enthrall'd:</L>
<L>He that an humble Captive did lie down</L>
<L>Is rais'd a conqu'ring Hero in Renown:</L>
<L>He thatâ€” But hold a sudden Exigence</L>
<L>Of my confus'd Affairs does call me hence.</L>
<L>Farewell, dear Saint! dear Martyr! and to you</L>
<L>(Pointing at me) I bid no long Farewel.</L>
<L>And then away she flew.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus I awak'd in Sweat and Agony,</L>
<L>As't fares with Men that are in exstasy.</L>
<L>At last my Sense return'd, I stare upright,</L>
<L>And then resolv'd this raptur'd Dream to write:</L>
<L>And leaving the Confinement of my Bed,</L>
<L>I heard the Reverend Primate <HI>C.</HI> was dead.</L>
<L>With that I into new Convulsions fell,</L>
<L>For fear I should mistake the Parallel;</L>
<L>Though I was told before, and partly knew,</L>
<L>All that I heard, and seen, to him was due.</L>
<L>But this is a new Theme, too great for me,</L>
<L>Which none can Fathom, 'cause there's no degree</L>
<L>In an indefinite Immensity:</L>
<L>On which so easy 'tis much to improve,</L>
<L>And so impossible to say enough.</L>
<L>Which never can defin'd more truly be,</L>
<L>Than when we own the Impossibility.</L>
<L>And therefore all the Honour we can show him,</L>
<L>Is but a little part of what we owe him.</L>
<L>What can loquacious Zeal then more imply,</L>
<L>Since all Encomiums into silence dye?</L>
<L>Silence, the properest Language, I confess,</L>
<L>Wonder and Veneration to express.</L>
