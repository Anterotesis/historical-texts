<HEAD>To the Right Honourable, CHARLES Lord Baron of <HI>Shelburne.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it please your Lordship,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving the Honour of being a Servant both to your Lord∣ship and your Excellent and most Worthy Father, and from my Infancy a dependance upon your Family, I humbly presume to dedi∣cate the following Narrative to your Lordship, being an Account of a most Scandalous Examination, given by one <HI>Jacob Myars</HI> (a Jew) which has not on∣ly brought me, but also a great part of the Kingdom, under severe Censure and Reflexion; as if the Ship <HI>Laurel</HI> had been most barbarously plunder'd by the Countrey through some Contrivances of mine; a Crime so abominable, that were I guilty, <HI>I</HI> deserve not only to be dismist your Lordships service, but to be stigmatiz'd, and excluded from the So∣ciety of Mankind. Yet as the glim∣mering
<PB REF="4"/> Candle being snuff'd, does straightway give the clearer Light, so <HI>I</HI> doubt not but your Lordship will find by perusing this Narrative, That their false Insinuations and Unjust Aspersions will cause my clouded Innocence to shine so much the brighter.</P>
<P>These and other Considerations obli∣ges me to publish matter of Fact: And since Addresses of this kind are a mode of the Times, and that it hath pleased the Divine Powers by their several Endow∣ments of Learning, Wisdom, Justice and divers other Honourable and V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtuous Qualities, to bless You as a Pattern to the Age You live in; I shall not omit, in all Humility, to beg Your Lordships Fa∣vour in other Occurrences, but to this no manner of Patronage, other then to Read and Judge one that desires Life no longer than while he demeans himself a faithful Subject to their Majesties, and in all Sincerity and Truth,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your Lordships most steady, and most Obedient Servant, <HI>RI. ORPEN.</HI></SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>IN LOCO PRAEFATII.</HEAD>
<P>SInce it is in a manner as unfashionable to write without a Preface, as it is to Dance before you have first made your Honours; so it may be as morose to urge the Reader to jump at once from the Title page into the Book, without leading him thither Modishly by a Preface; tho' otherwise the Title page it self might have sup∣plyd that.</P>
<P>When an infamous Rumor has once taken place in the minds of the Publique, it's as difficult a matter to remove the impression, as to confute a Bigot in his first received Opinion of Religion; the nature of the one aspiring to judge, being prone to Positiveness and Censure, is as ready to condemn upon false information, as on the other side to ap∣plaud and cry up a person for some great Merit, that never deserved it: so the other shall, for want of Arguments, stand up, Rail and Redden, nay venter his life, and fight for that which he knows no more of then the Game-Cock when car∣ry'd
<PB REF="5"/> from the Pit, knows of the grounds of that Battle wherein he has all day so inveteratly ma∣naged the Gauntlet against his like ignorant Chal∣lenger. The more uncensorious and impartiall, are perhaps waiting for the true Narative of that mat∣ter, which is said to be nine parts of ten of the pre∣sent discourse of many <HI>Courts, Exchanges, Walks</HI> and <HI>Coffee-houses</HI> throughout <HI>Christendom.</HI> But least this may be over-masted, and so provoke the passionate Inquisitor impatiently, to say that There is too much Sail for such a Vessel, we shall here put the Reader aboard, and then let him speak as he finds.</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>LONDON</HI>-MASTER: OR, THE <HI>JEW</HI> DETECTED, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the West of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Munster,</HI> lieth the River of <HI>Kilmare,</HI> about 11 Leagues from the Main up into the Countrey, adorned on each side with divers capacious and defencible Harbours, wherein thou∣sands of the best Ships may safely ride at once, with ready Outlets for the Outward or Home∣ward bound Ships; and many Conveniencies for great Fisheries, as Herring, Pilchard, and Sal∣mon; To say nothing of divers kinds of Hook-Fish, as Hake, Cod, Ling, Polluck, Mackarel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> wherewith this River aboundeth, capable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Trade both by Sea and Land; as it was before <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he last War, after Sir <HI>William Petty</HI> had erected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>everal considerable Fisheries, built the Iron-Works, opened the Lead-Mines, and promoted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Trade of Rape-Seed on each side of the Ri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, and planted a Collony there of 815 Souls <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f English Protestants at his Expence of above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0000 <HI>l.</HI> Sterl. to the general Enrichment of
<PB N="2" REF="6"/> that part of the Kingdom, and the great Aug∣mentation of the Kings Revenue; all which were demolish'd and destroy'd by the last Wars and not above 75 of those Protestants now left in being; so greatly the Heirs of Sir <HI>William Petty,</HI> and this Collony of Protestants, have been Suf∣ferers in the late Troubles by their Adventures in that desolate part of the Kingdom, where the Natives by the right Numbering of the People were found to be above 900 Papists to one single Protestant; who were never thorowly subdu'd since the War of 1641, nor in the best of times brought ameanable to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> until the same was performed, in a great measure, by this English Plantation; where now again, ever since the last War, 20, 30, and sometimes 100 at a time of <HI>Toryes</HI> have march'd openly in Arms up and down that Country, and upon the approach of any consider <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ole part of the Army, have disperst themselves into smaller Companies, and are conceal'd among the Glins and Fast∣nesses; where if any of the Inhabitants are suspe∣cted as Discoverers, They and their Friends are immediately destroyed, by burning thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Houses, cropping their Ears, and cutting ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Tongues, and sometimes keeping them Pri∣soners whole Nights, stark naked, in the ope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fields.</P>
<P>Into this River, as a place for the purpose, ar∣rived the <HI>Laurel of London, Christopher Ly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Master, she carry'd ten Guns, Burthen 150 Tun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="3" REF="6"/> richly Laden (as gather'd from the Master and People belonging to her) with Sugars, Log∣wood, Fastick, Lyme-Juice, Indigo, Ginger, Cotton, Paint, Pemento, and great store of Gold and Silver, and divers Ingots besides; from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> bound for <HI>London,</HI> having on Board as Passengers, <HI>Jacob Myars</HI> (the Jew) and <HI>Peter Row,</HI> as also one Mr. <HI>Spyers,</HI> who was said to be Son-in-law to one of the Owners of the Ship, but so indispos'd and sickly, that it's doubtful whether he vvas concern'd in the Stratagem or not. They gave an account that on the 27th of <HI>January</HI> 1693, in the morning, they were four Leagues to the West of the <HI>Bull, Cow,</HI> and <HI>Calf,</HI> <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"/> when first they made them, and believ'd them to be the <HI>Skellox,</HI> until they were undeceiv'd by the Main Land so near them; and tho' they de∣clar'd a Resolution for <HI>Kinsale,</HI> and to lye there <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"/> until some Ship of War could come and receive them into her care, and convoy them safe for <HI>London;</HI> yet one may conclude that they shap't an extravagant careless Course, to stand for the River of <HI>Killmare;</HI> vvhereas the wind being at West, four leagues to the west of the <HI>Bull, &amp;c.</HI> <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"/> They might sail in a manner right before it, for the <HI>Old Head</HI> of <HI>Kinsale;</HI> The heavens acted no∣thing to the contrary; and had they designed vvhat they pretended, It's very manifest by Scale and Flovver-de-luce, and by the accompts of the Winds, and the sufficient good order of the Ship, that she might have arrived there vvith less diffi∣culty then she did in <HI>Killmare.</HI></P>
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
<P>But <HI>Killmare</HI> was the place alloted for the fa∣tal knock, which without Resolution, or pre∣meditated intention, could not be well accom∣plish'd in that River, by reason of the many Har∣bours gaping on every side thereof to receive and entertain any Ships whatever, and by reason of the boldness of the Shores upon the River, and all these Harbours; so as a Ship Turning up the River, or into the Harbours, may safely dare to Nose every Rock with her Boltsprit; <HI>I</HI> say not <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"/> well to be accomplisht, especially while the wind held its own at W. the River lying W. S. W. and E. N. E. but two points from blowing directly up the River, and might very well serve for putting into any of these Harbours; <HI>Capanacossy</HI> is the only Shole and lyeth near the upper end of the River; But so landlockt, that there is no manner of Danger, because the greatest Winds <MILESTONE N="12" UNIT="appendix page"/> have not power to create Seas, or to make any, <MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="appendix page"/> more then a small cockling of the water; And 'tis to be observed for ever, that it's the Seas, and not the Winds, can do a Ship any considerable prejudice in cases of distress of this kind; for let the Winds be never so violent, a Ship shall never beat in smooth Waters.</P>
<P>Into this River, as the place of Execution, they arrived on the 27th of <HI>January</HI> 1693, in the evening, and dropt their best Bower, and so came to an Anchor under <HI>Rossmore</HI>-point, about mid∣way up the River, where, as the winds continued still at West, she might ride well enough, as she
<PB N="5" REF="7"/> did all that night, for they were not resolved to cast her away untill they had fix'd upon a con∣venient shore to save themselves, and their mo∣ny, in their long boat. That evening they had a full prospect of the greatest part of the River, and the openings of the several Harbours; Next morning, a little after Six a clock, they cut their Cable, pretending that she would not ride for want of the Mizen-Mast, for they had taken care to cut That by the board, before she came into the River, to prevent her yawing as she sayl'd afore the winds, as tho' nothing could prevent it, but the cutting away of that Mast; But the rea∣sons why they wounded and hackt the main-yard, the fore-yard, and the fore-top-saile-yard in seve∣ral places about the middle of the yards, are yet <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"/> kept to themselves. But would they speak ingeni∣ously, they must say 'twas done that they might crack and break in sunder when the sails should <MILESTONE N="22" UNIT="appendix page"/> fill with the violent winds, and thereby make the greater shew of distress? Having cut the Ca∣ble, she drove up along the north side of the Ri∣ver, and coming towards <HI>Black-Water,</HI> a very good Harbour, and right afore the wind, which <MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="appendix page"/> now veer'd to the S.W. they made ready, and the <MILESTONE N="12" UNIT="appendix page"/> Master, Passengers, and the whole Ships company, <MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="appendix page"/> got out with their Treasure of Gold and Silver, and in their long-boat they came ashore at <HI>Black-Water,</HI> <MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="appendix page"/> and presently sunk their boat, and marcht <MILESTONE N="12" UNIT="appendix page"/> up by land along the River side, about two miles from <HI>Black-Water</HI> to the house of one <HI>Dermot
<PB N="6" REF="8"/> mac Owen,</HI> at <HI>Cappanacossy,</HI> about seven a Clock that morning; but their Ship was got <MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="appendix page"/> to <HI>Cappanacossy</HI> almost as soon as they, without <MILESTONE N="11" UNIT="appendix page"/> a Soul on board her, where she drove to and fro <MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="appendix page"/> before their faces, with the Flood and Ebb, all <MILESTONE N="12" UNIT="appendix page"/> that day; while the Master, Passengers, and <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> Company, divided the Treasure among them∣selves, <MILESTONE N="22" UNIT="appendix page"/> to every one a share; and sent for Li∣quor <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="appendix page"/> from on board, to make themselves and <MILESTONE N="12" UNIT="appendix page"/> the Country People merry, Renouncing their Ship, and declaring her a Wreck, in a place <MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="appendix page"/> where a Ship could not be lost, but by some Sinister means.</P>
<P>But their greatest concern was how to provide Horses and Conveniencyes to carry themselves <MILESTONE N="12" UNIT="appendix page"/> and their Treasure out of the Country, without any manner of regard to their Ship or Cargo: They mockt and spurn'd at every body that ad∣vised them to betake themselves to their Ship; And such as were importunate to have her saved, <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="appendix page"/> they caused to be soundly drubb'd.</P>
<P>Having spent that day in jollity and carrous∣ing after the Treasure was distributed, The <MILESTONE N="13" UNIT="appendix page"/> Master at length was prevail'd upon to write to Mr. <HI>Thomas Palmer,</HI> a Minister, and one of the Justices of the peace of that County, living about three miles up the River side from <HI>Cap∣ponacossy.</HI> And in his letter he pretended some <MILESTONE N="31" UNIT="appendix page"/> distress, and that he had not a sail left; tho' at <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"/> the same time, there was a whole suit on board: <MILESTONE N="25" UNIT="appendix page"/> Whereupon Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> went to him in the even∣ing,
<PB N="7" REF="8"/> and told him that his Ship was in very <MILESTONE N="13" UNIT="appendix page"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tle danger, and advis'd him to get his men to∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ether, <MILESTONE N="33" UNIT="appendix page"/> and go on board again; But the Ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er seem'd to despair of ever getting her out of <MILESTONE N="7" UNIT="appendix page"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at place, and desir'd that some of the Country <MILESTONE N="12" UNIT="appendix page"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eople might make the most they could of her. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> bid him still be of good courage, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd told him that <HI>she could be saved without any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anner of difficulty;</HI> And then by further discourse, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e understood that they had great quantityes of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old and Silver at <HI>Dermot mac Owen's</HI> house, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d did therefore alarm them to go on board <MILESTONE N="33" UNIT="appendix page"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith their Treasure; telling them, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untry abounded with Toryes, and that their <MILESTONE N="7" UNIT="appendix page"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ip was the best Garison in those parts; upon <MILESTONE N="13" UNIT="appendix page"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hich apprehension of the Toryes, the Master <MILESTONE N="7" UNIT="appendix page"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssengers, and Seamen, repair'd again to their <MILESTONE N="33" UNIT="appendix page"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ip with all expedition, and were afterwards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re cautious in their designe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; Yet took no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nner of care to preserve the Ship; but dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>untenanced, and rejected several skillfull Sea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="appendix page"/> of the Country, when they offered to bring <MILESTONE N="8" UNIT="appendix page"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r into a good Harbour. <MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="appendix page"/> </P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> Returned home that night, and <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t several of the English People with Men, and <MILESTONE N="33" UNIT="appendix page"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ats, to fetch off the Ship, the night being fine <MILESTONE N="25" UNIT="appendix page"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d calm; And sent some Soldiers likewise on <MILESTONE N="29" UNIT="appendix page"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd, lest the Rabble of the Country, or the To∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, <MILESTONE N="19" UNIT="appendix page"/> should make any attempt upon her; But all <MILESTONE N="33" UNIT="appendix page"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o purpose, for the master would not suffer <MILESTONE N="19" UNIT="appendix page"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m to get her away, But got up a Cask of <MILESTONE N="29" UNIT="appendix page"/>

The next day being the 1st of <HI>February,</HI> (the third day after the Ship was stranded,) The Master came again <MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="appendix page"/> to the Ship, and the first thing he did, was to come <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="appendix page"/> privately under her sterne to view her deaths <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> wounds, Vizt. the holes which he had made in the bread-room thorow her bottom, the morning he quitted her, where he found the water gushing out of her, as its said, <HI>the blood freshens at the murtherer when he is brought to lay his hand upon the Corps before the Inquest;</HI> But stepping <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="appendix page"/> on board, Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> shewd him that the water was in her hold within a foot and a halfe of the Beam; whereupon the Master ordered that a hole <MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="appendix page"/> should be made to let it out, which was according∣ly <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="appendix page"/> done, and desired the Master to stay on board and take an account of things, and to see the holes stopt, and likewise desired him to send for his <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"/> men; one seaman being worth five landmen for working in a ship. But he stayed no longer <MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="appendix page"/> aboard, then to order great part of the Sugars <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"/> (which had received some damage) to be given away to the Country people and to see it done, and having filled some baggs with the white Sugars, carry'd them with him to his quarters; <MILESTONE N="45" UNIT="appendix page"/> but returned not again untill five days after, nei∣ther did he send any of his men, but hastned them away out of the country, without keeping one of <MILESTONE N="46" UNIT="appendix page"/> them to stay in the Ship.</P>

<P>THough Capt. <HI>Gregorye</HI>'s modesty will not give him leave to ask any gratuity for his Soldiers service, yet I hope your discretion will tell you what he may expect upon this occasion; and I hope what his extraordinary Civility forbids him to ask, your Gratitude will make you give him; he has sent away the Bagg of Sugar, having the con∣veniency of a Guard But he setts a very small value upon it; If you deliver two Firkins of Lymejuice to his Serjeant, and what ever else you think worth his acceptance, it will come safely to his hands; The Captain of the Ship says, there are Sweetmeats Chocolett and Jamaica Peper and Ginger aboard; But I need not advise you in this case, You that have been so much conversant in those things, need not to be at a loss what to do; only I take leave to tell you as a friend, that as you may incur his Favour by this, So you may his Displeasure, by the neglect of it, which

</LETTER>
<P>It's very evident what unjust errands the Capt. and Mr. <HI>Bland</HI> went upon the day before, when they visited Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> and Mr. <HI>Crump</HI> on board the Ship, which, though (as the Letter speaks,) bashful to ask for, yet they blush not to write for, next day; Mr. <HI>Orpen,</HI> returned this answer, That the Soldiers must be paid if they did any service; And as cases stood, he would not dispose of any thing; but hop'd that in a little time, a division would be made; And as soon as he had his share Set out, which was due to him for Salvage, he would pay his respects to them, with Presents of every sort; which unsatisfying answer not fuiting well with the covetousness of the Captain and the Parson, proved of ill consequence to Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> and Mr. <HI>Crump;</HI> For the Capt. and Mr. <HI>Bland</HI> set up for the Master and Crew, Ma∣ing them now Saints, whom but lately before they had condemned for Devills; they incensed <HI>Edward Herbert</HI> the high Sherrif, a man of no small <HI>Power,</HI> and <HI>Charles Monk</HI> Esq; Collector of the County of <HI>Kerry,</HI> against Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> and Mr. <HI>Crump,</HI> as tho' they were the only persons that had destroyed the Ship and Cargo; And had forced the Master by head and shoulders out of the Ship; And having obtained from the Master and Passenger what <HI>Orpen,</HI> had refused to give
<PB N="24" REF="16"/> upon the request of that most disingenious Letter, They still continued to raise and foment divers evil reports, especially against Mr. <HI>Orpen,</HI> as though he had been, not only the principal de∣stroyer of the Ship, but that he had also contriv∣ed the burning of Mr. <HI>Palmer's</HI> house: Haste is now the necessity; and Major <HI>Steers</HI> the Grand Informer of the County of <HI>Kerry,</HI> was posted away to <HI>Dublin,</HI> to fill that City with the noise. The <HI>Sh.</HI> joines with the Capt. and Mr. <HI>Bl.</HI> and represents <HI>Orpen</HI> as a person very obnoxious and culpable in the whole proceeding of the Ship. What cannot a man accomplish, tho' never so ill a member? Can he want Friends while he has any thing to give away? The Sh. the Cap. &amp; Mr. <HI>Bl.</HI> have received Presents from the Master, Pas∣sengers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whom they immediately restored to their reputation again; and Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> is as soon traduced to the World: vvho if he had been but earlier in <HI>Presents</HI> then the Master, had un∣doubtedly bore the Bell; But neglecting to pay the Twenty Guinnyes which the Sh. desired to have, as a br. or gift, and for refusing comply∣ance to an unlawful Request of a Minister, is now under those dangers which are preacht out a∣gainst him and <HI>Crump,</HI> in the perclose of Mr. <HI>Bl</HI>'s Letter.</P>
<P>The Capt. having carry'd away several con∣siderable <MILESTONE N="41" UNIT="appendix page"/> goods of the Ship to <HI>Ross-Castle,</HI> leaves the Sh. in <HI>Glannerought</HI> to come up in his place, Giving him the command of his men; The stores
<PB N="25" REF="16"/> being nevertheless frequently robb'd while the Sh. and the Master had care of them; No <MILESTONE N="35" UNIT="appendix page"/> marvel it should be so, while the Soldiers, the <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"/> Toryes, and an ill pack which attended the Ma∣ster, <MILESTONE N="37" UNIT="appendix page"/> were continually about the place.</P>
<P>Now let any unbyast man consider the condi∣tion of that part of the Country, and how ly∣able the poor inhabitants thereof are to entertain Toryes in their houses, when Capt. <HI>Gregoryes</HI> Soldiers have made such neighbour-hood with them, which is not obsevable altogether in them only, for the Cap. himself who lives by the sword, <MILESTONE N="35" UNIT="appendix page"/> whose trade is to fight, and receives the Kings pay upon that account, is of resolution as far from engaging the Toryes as his Soldiers are from be∣ing at War with them. And you shall find that the Cap. hath no manner of inclination to sup∣press <MILESTONE N="36" UNIT="appendix page"/> the Toryes, and that his men have been kind to him, for allowing them to quarter where the Toryes have reforted: not to kill or take them, <MILESTONE N="26" UNIT="appendix page"/> but to have leave to Range upon free quarters, whereby the remedy is become allmost as bad as the disease; upwards of thirty familyes having Fled, bag and bagage, from the cruelty of these Soldiers, who could not expect that kind of li∣berty, <MILESTONE N="35" UNIT="appendix page"/> if there were no Toryes; and the Cap's own behaviour in this Affair, describes him no otherwise than a <HI>Moderate Fighter,</HI> or <HI>Worse;</HI> of which the former indeed is more dispensable: For, if a man be not inspired with Courage, how can it be expected where it is not? And if God
<PB N="26" REF="17"/> and Nature design'd it for him, he must blame the ineptitude of his own Organs, or the Imbeci∣lity of the Womb that did not sufficiently purifie them, so as to make them capable to entertain a Spirit suitable to his Profession; <HI>Oportet ut mens sana, sit in corpore sano;</HI> It is a thousand pities that a Man of his Nerves should want a Mind: For the other there can be no manner of Pardon in any Person whatsoever, that is false to his God, and Traytor to his King; and for a small Pattern of his Heroick Atchievements, look into the Ap∣pendix, pag. 35, 37, 40, 26. And are not the rest of the Noble Acts of Cap. <HI>Greg.</HI> and his Men, (and how they have ruined above a hundred Fa∣milies) writ in a particular Book of his Life, while he ruled in that Countrey?</P>
<P>But behold, while they are thus in Neighbour∣hood with the worst and most bloody of the <HI>To∣ries,</HI> Lo! they are at the same time at work before <MILESTONE N="39" UNIT="appendix page"/> the <HI>Lords Justices</HI> and <HI>Council</HI> against Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> Cashier'd Servants were tamper'd with, Indigent Persons tempted, and Scavengers on every side, were employ'd to rake up Dirt against him; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> length they produc'd a Letter of his, (which has lain asleep since <HI>October</HI> last) to the Commander <MILESTONE N="39" UNIT="appendix page"/> of <HI>Ross-Castle,</HI> to set at liberty one <HI>Cnohor Boy,</HI> if he were not guilty of some Crime, being no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Tory at that time, but had been the Detector of <MILESTONE N="38" UNIT="appendix page"/> Fourscore and odd notorious Robbers, by whose <MILESTONE N="34" UNIT="appendix page"/> means rhey were brought to condign punishment, <MILESTONE N="33" UNIT="appendix page"/> and in all probability had effected the like upon
<PB N="27" REF="17"/> all the rest of the Tories throughout the Province of <HI>Munster,</HI> if he had not been ill rewarded for his good Services, and so forced to escape; whose Liberty would not be granted to Mr. <HI>Or∣pen</HI> for the Publick Good: And it being then dis∣covered <MILESTONE N="37" UNIT="appendix page"/> to the Tories, that he had been, and was to be their Discoverer, and being also eagerly <MILESTONE N="38" UNIT="appendix page"/> pursued without intermission by the Soldiers on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he one side, and the proclaimed Tories on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he other, he was forced for Self-preservation, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et up a Company of <HI>Tories</HI> for himself, there <MILESTONE N="38" UNIT="appendix page"/> being no Peace to be had for him, either from the <HI>Soldiers,</HI> or the unrighteous <HI>Mammon;</HI> and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fterwards became the most notorious Robber in <MILESTONE N="38" UNIT="appendix page"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Kingdom.</P>
<P>Thus, we our selves have forced them to be Toryes, that were the very Instruments to detect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem. Thus with a seeming Zeale to the cause, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey run to the Government (the Fountain of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustice) with their clandestine complaints against Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> about <HI>Cn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her Boy;</HI> whereas indeed it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s with no other design then to sculk behind the Laws, for that complaints of this kind, are cog∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isable before any Justice of the peace in the pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er County, against a person that is not of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmy: nor in the Comision of the peace. See how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey have dealt with the Government in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atter; after all their noise about <HI>Cnoher Boy,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shew them at length a Reed shaken with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ind, for the intent of that great clamor could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im no further, then highly to involve Mr. <HI>Or∣pen</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="18"/> into Censures and Expences, and so have him condemn'd before he was heard, thereby to wound him sorely in his Reputation and Purse, the better to carry on their other designs against him, about the Ship; for why did not they after all the stir which they made in <HI>Dublin</HI> about the Toryes, bring somewhat of that kind against him before the Grand-Jury at the last General Commission of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer</HI> held in <HI>Kerry</HI> on the 26th of <HI>March</HI> 1694, when he dared them to it in open Court, and when the Ld. C. J. <HI>Pine</HI> told Major <HI>Steers</HI> their late confident in <HI>Dub∣lin,</HI> that 'twas now a very firt time to do it.</P>
<P>But to return again to the Ship, without ma∣king five days, digression, as the Master did, for he <MILESTONE N="45" UNIT="appendix page"/> came not nigh her again until the 7th of <HI>Febru∣ary,</HI> that Mr. <HI>Monk</HI> perswaded him to go on board, and then he made but about an hours stay, and went not to her again until the 12th where <MILESTONE N="46" UNIT="appendix page"/> he stay'd about another hour (Leaving one Mr. <HI>Richard Clarke</HI> to look after things on board) who until that day never went to concern <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="appendix page"/> himself with the Ship, or any thing belonging to her: But the work being over for several days before, and all the Salvable part of the Goods (except some damnified Ginger, and the Fustick, which lay in the Balast) being already brought away by Mr. <HI>Orpen;</HI> Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> Rumidg'd for an hour or two up and down her hold, and be∣twixt Decks; and then left her, and the Master went not nigh her any more until the 15th. Now
<PB N="29" REF="18"/> had the Master any manner of inclination for the preserving of the Ship and Goods, he would not have lain away from her, while her Decks could be kept dry; Nay, tho' he were forced to lye in his cloaths all the time. All this while the Master, Passengers and Seamen never mention'd <MILESTONE N="11" UNIT="appendix page"/> any thing of the holes that were bored in the Ship, but kept it private until about the 10th of <HI>February,</HI> that the Country began to ring of it. For it seemes the Mate or Carpenter as they tra∣vel'd, had made discovery thereof to some per∣sons that brought the account of it back to <HI>Kill∣mare.</HI> Then and never before, the Master own∣ed, that there were holes bored in the Breadroom thorow her bottom, and that he did it pur∣posely to lodge her in the strand, that by the weight of water in her hold, she might Sit the faster from beating; But sure he will not im∣pute <MILESTONE N="22" UNIT="appendix page"/> it to his own Ignorance that he knew not that she was but 10 foot in the Hold and that she lay in 15 foot water in that place.</P>
<P>During these Transactions, the Master, Mr. <HI>Myars,</HI> Mr. <HI>Row</HI> and Mr. <HI>Orpen,</HI> were very good Friends, save that one Firebrand was cast in among them by Capt. <HI>Gregory,</HI> by Stirring up both sides to speak hard of each other, and carry'd the same from one to t'other; which lost nothing in the carriage; so that he rais'd some heats which lasted not above a day or two; and it appears, that hitherto Cap. <HI>Gregory's</HI> incen∣diaryes, took no great root among them, for that
<PB N="30" REF="19"/> the Master and these Passengers went frequently to eat and drink at Mr. <HI>Orpen's</HI> house; and upon the 11th of <HI>February</HI> after dinner, all three call'd him aside, and told him, how well satisfied they were with his behaviour in that affair of the Ship and Goods, and desired him to take the trouble <MILESTONE N="45" UNIT="appendix page"/> of the future mannagment thereof, promising <MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="appendix page"/> that he should have his Salvage, and that they resolved to go together for <HI>England;</HI> but would first make a conveyance of all to him, and he to deliver up the same to them or their Orders upon <MILESTONE N="45" UNIT="appendix page"/> demand, after allowing him his Salvage; where∣upon they call'd Mr. <HI>Monk,</HI> and having made him acquainted with what they had motion'd to Mr. <HI>Orpen,</HI> they pray'd the favour of him to draw writings between them to that effect: and in the evening, they took leave of Mr. <HI>Orpen,</HI> and every one went to his uarters, and Mr. <HI>Monk</HI> spent a considerable part of the night in drawing the Instruments.</P>
<P>But the Sh. who lay all the while in ambush for a grasp at the Goods, lodg'd in the same House with Mr. <HI>Monk,</HI> and by some means pry'd into the Writings, and next morning he came along with Mr. <HI>Monk,</HI> accompany'd with Cap. <HI>Gregory,</HI> to <HI>Killowen,</HI> where they found the Master, the two Passengers, and Mr. <HI>Orpen,</HI> very friendly together. Now or never was the time for the Sh. to set them at variance, which indeed he accom∣plish'd with a witness: For he plainly saw that he was at that instant like to be put by from ever
<PB N="31" REF="19"/> having any concern with these Goods: And there upon, in vehemency and wrath he insinuated to the Master and Passengers, That himself vvas high Sh. of the County, a Justice of peace of the County, Lieut. of the County, vvho could com∣mand the Army, as vvell as the Militia of the County; and vvhat was it that he could not do in the County? And withall told them soberly, that they were under some censures for casting away their Ship, and destroying the Cargo; and that he, and only he, could set them right with their Owners in <HI>England,</HI> and with the Govern∣ment in <HI>Ireland;</HI> And then turn'd to some old Law-Book, directing (as he pretended) that all Wrecks ought to be deposited with the Sheriff. The valiant Cap. <HI>Gregory,</HI> (who had made them understand by the daily Out-rages of himself and <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="appendix page"/> his Men, that he govern'd indeed with no less Arbitrariness than the high Sh. and as Despotical <MILESTONE N="41" UNIT="appendix page"/> as he for his Life) entertain'd them with his Mili∣tary Rhetorick, hovv absolute he vvas in all mat∣ters of Government and Command: Yet that himself and the high Sh. vvere but as one Man, vvho being a person vvell practic'd in Controver∣sies, could either raise or depress them as he plea∣sed; and advised them to quit all others, and stick to the Sh. <HI>One Horse Nabs another;</HI> and People of a sort soon agree: The high Sh. the Cap. the Master, <HI>Jacob Myars,</HI> and <HI>Peter Row,</HI> sprung presently as a sworn Covey, and Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> was no more to be consulted with, but look'd upon as
<PB N="32" REF="20"/> a Person qualified to ruine their Councils and De∣signs.</P>
<P>From hence forth Cap. <HI>Gregory,</HI> the high Sh. and Mr <HI>Bl.</HI> (being well sweetned with some of the best Sugars) became Patrons to the Master, and these Passengers, &amp; by the frequent incursions of the first, That part of the Country about <HI>Kill∣mare,</HI> was harass'd as though it had been the Ene∣myes Quarters; for he had always a ravenous pack at his heels, who prey'd upon the Country day and night, without paying for the Provisi∣ons which they exacted from the poor People in their continual marches, under the notion of search∣ing for the Ships Goods, Tumbling and tossing all their little housholdry, and janting it in that manner, from house to house, they beat and wounded the Men, Ravish'd Women and Maids, and set Houses afire; But when they had Forced the People to give them all their mony, they put out the fire again. These doings past under the notion of serving the Owners, who have also paid dearly for their Services, and had they thought fit to have consulted Mr. <HI>Orpen,</HI> he had made appear the many havocks which were commited by the Master, Passengers, the high Sh. Cap. <HI>Gregory</HI> and Mr <HI>Bl.</HI> and they should find at what rate the Master and Passen∣gers have bought the patronages of those three Gentlemen; which began more openly upon the 12 of <HI>February;</HI> and on the 13th the Sh. fram'd an advantageous Narrative by his Letter
<PB N="33" REF="20"/> to the Government, in the behalf of his <HI>Sweet Clyents,</HI> and becomes Merchant for great part of the Goods, and waited at <HI>Killmare</HI> for an or∣der (in answer to his Letter) to Seiz both Ship and Goods into his own possession; and so by his power of Shrievalty, Replevins, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to wrest from Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> and the rest of the English of those parts, what was due to them for Salvage; and by his merit of that kind, to win the Owners favour, into some great <HI>Presents</HI> for his good ser∣vices, whom the Master and Passengers in the mean time visited by their Letters, Setting forth the worthyness of the Sh. as the only persen fit to be trusted in the whole concerns of the Ship and Goods; and how highly he had appeared against Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> and the rest of their Ene∣mies.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> and the English Petitioned to the Government against the proceedings of the Sh. who waited big with expectation of a power to seize, &amp;c. But no such thing appearing, nor finding the success he wisht for, and that his Letter was not so taking as expected, Mr. <HI>Myars</HI> hastens away to <HI>Dublin,</HI> well trained to every particular requisite to back the Letter of the 13th, who ar∣rived there about the 5th of <HI>March,</HI> and on the 6th made his examination ready, and on the 7th was examined before the Hon<SUP>ble</SUP> Sr. <HI>Henry Ec∣clin,</HI> one of the Barrons of the Exchequer, which Examination scream'd so loudly against the beha∣vior of Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> and the English, that the Go∣vernment
<PB N="34" REF="21"/> conceiving it necessary to take cogni∣zance thereof, sent to the Right Honourable Sir <HI>Rich. Pyne,</HI> Lord Chief Justice of their Majesties Court of <HI>Common Pleas</HI> (then upon the <HI>Munster</HI> Circuit) to inquire into the whole matter, and to report the same, and Colonel <HI>Denny</HI> and Col. <HI>Hasset,</HI> two of the Deputy-Governours, and Justices of the peace for the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Kerry,</HI> were required to have Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> and Mr. <HI>Crump</HI> ap∣prehended, and thereupon they issued their War∣rant to the H. Sh. to that purpose, who was overjoy∣ed to see the growth of his labour and wit arrive to that perfection, and put the Warrant in exe∣cution after a strange manner; Not by himself, or any of his under-Officers, but employ'd Serjeant <HI>Fullerton</HI> (brother in law to Capt. <HI>Gregory</HI>) who with ten Musquetteers came to Mr. <HI>Orpens</HI> house, and took him prisoner, without letting him know upon what account, other then that their Capt. had commanded them to do it; He askt them, was it by warrant or by order? The Serjeant told him that he had a warrant; But would not be prevailed upon to shew it, or to give the least hint of the purport thereof. But at length he said that it was for Harbouring of Toryes, and gave out to the neighbourhood <HI>(inter alia)</HI> that 'twas for supplying the Torys with ten quarts of Powder.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding that Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> seemed un∣concerned at these proceedings; Yet the new English Collony which he brought into that
<PB N="35" REF="21"/> Country, began to repine at their misfortune, and wisht that they had never come out of <HI>England;</HI> And finding him thus troubled on account of <MILESTONE N="33" UNIT="appendix page"/> Toryes, whom they knew to be one of the greatest suppressors of Malefactors throwout the <MILESTONE N="34" UNIT="appendix page"/> Province, and well assured in their consciences, that <MILESTONE N="39" UNIT="appendix page"/> he was no way guilty of such a crime, they con∣cluded that the Sh. Ca. <HI>Gregory,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bl.</HI> would soon have them all accused, and prosecu∣ted upon the like account, and thereupon resolved to be gone bag and baggage as fast as they could out of their reach. The Serjeant and party took away Mr. <HI>Orp.</HI> out of his house in great hurry, not affording him time to put on his cloaths, to the great glory of the high Sh. to see his prisoner carry'd thro' the Towns with ten Musquetteers; a very unpracticable way of executing the warrant of the Civil Magistrates.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> is now Prisoner at <HI>Tralee,</HI> and by the 23th of <HI>March</HI> was Examined, and Bail'd to appear the 26th, being the day that my Lord Chief Justice had appointed for the Tryal; which was bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very short time to provide him∣self and his wittnesses, being at that time of the year accounted four days Journey from thence home to <HI>Glannerought,</HI> and back to <HI>Tralee</HI> again; However, he was there on the 26th, with several Witnesses. But his Enemies having informed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hemselves who they were, made interest to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem all accused for Felony; and thereupon pro∣cured <MILESTONE N="32" UNIT="appendix page"/> a Warrant from the L. C. J. and had them
<PB N="36" REF="22"/> apprehended for this pretended Felony, to put them off with Fear and Expence, from giving their Testimonies.</P>
<P>Upon the 27th in the morning, a Bill of In∣dictment against <HI>Orpen</HI> and <HI>Crump,</HI> was found by the Grand Jury, for taking two Hogsheads of Sugar, and eight Hogsheads of Lime-Juyce, of the proper Goods of <HI>Peter Row,</HI> out of the Ship <HI>Laurel;</HI> In the afternoon they were call'd: but for want of Witnesses to prove the Accusative Al∣legations, 'twas put off till next morning; and the Tryal could not yet be brought on, for want-of such Witnesses: Whereupon Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> told the Court, That he confess'd to have saved such Goods, and that he would prove the Master's Or∣ders for it; and prayed to have the Tryal go on; not thinking what kind of Preparations were made against him. The Couragious Major <HI>Steers,</HI> who was principal Engine to inform against him in <HI>Dublin,</HI> and a chief Cock-Feather in the Jews Cap, was call'd to be Foreman of the Jury; <HI>Theo∣philus Morris,</HI> who was not of the County, but Agent for the Owners and Merchants, was the next call'd, both which were excepted against by <MILESTONE N="43" UNIT="appendix page"/> Mr. <HI>Orpen;</HI> and some were call'd and answer'd, <MILESTONE N="35" UNIT="appendix page"/> but for private Reasons were struck out by the Sh. without any Exception of either side. But a Jury being Empanell'd and Sworn; The Ma∣ster, <HI>Samuel Aldwel</HI> and <HI>Bryan Kelly,</HI> were sworn on behalf of the Prosecutors. The Master made (in terms) a long Harrangue of his Course, and
<PB N="37" REF="22"/> Departure, in his vvhole Sailing, until his Arrival in <HI>Kilmare,</HI> and how he vvas forced in by distress <MILESTONE N="31" UNIT="appendix page"/> of Weather, how his Ship had lost all her Sails, hovv he lost his Sheet-Anchor-Stock, how he forsook her on the 28th of <HI>January</HI> in the morn∣ing, <MILESTONE N="25" UNIT="appendix page"/> after cutting his Cable; hovv he vvent on board her again, and bor'd holes in her to set her fast from beating, and how he carry'd eleven barrels of Indigo ashore when he forsook her out right on the 30th of <HI>January.</HI> But deny'd that ever he desired Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> to save any thing belonging to her, and that he went into her with∣out his consent, and turned out those whom the Master had employ'd, Vizt. O <HI>Sulivan More,</HI> Capt. <HI>Carthy,</HI> Mr. <HI>Aldwell</HI> and Mr. <HI>Clarke.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Aldwell</HI> swore, That himself went not on board, till after she was brought safe to the Creek, And that Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> did not turn <MILESTONE N="26" UNIT="appendix page"/> him out, but employ'd him to help to save the goods; That he never pretended any power <MILESTONE N="32" UNIT="appendix page"/> from the Master; That Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> shewd them a Broad Seal, but 'twas to encourage the men to their Arms against the Rapparees. And that had not Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> taken the matter upon him, the Ship and Cargo had been destroy'd, as appears by his Affidavit.</P>
<P><HI>Bryen Kelly</HI> Swore that he was present when the Master desired Mr <HI>Orpen</HI> to go on board and save what he could, who thereupon employ'd him and others; But sent him to the Master for <MILESTONE N="7" UNIT="appendix page"/> a note under his hand, which the Master gave; <MILESTONE N="8" UNIT="appendix page"/>
<PB N="38" REF="23"/> That none of the persons which the Master pre∣tended to have been employ'd by himself, came <MILESTONE N="9" UNIT="appendix page"/> unto her until others employ'd by Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> had brought her safe to the Creek; as appears by his Affidavit.</P>
<P>There were Sworne on the behalf of the Tra∣versers, <HI>Joseph Taylor, Charles Mansfield,</HI> and <HI>Tymothy Murphey; Joseph Taylor</HI> Swore, that the Master shew'd a full resolution against saving the Ship: That he exprest several frivolous pre∣tences <MILESTONE N="24" UNIT="appendix page"/> against lightening her; That he refused to <MILESTONE N="25" UNIT="appendix page"/> accept of a stock for his Sheet Anchor, That she fleeted, but no care was taken by the Master to save her, <HI>pro ut</HI> his affidavit.</P>
<P><HI>Charles Mansfield</HI> Swore, That the Master had no mind to save the Ship; And that he was with him the day he left her, being the 30th of <HI>January,</HI> when he desired Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> to go and save what he could, and that Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> did Ac∣cordingly employ several persons, who saved her, <MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="appendix page"/> and what they could of the Goods; that the <MILESTONE N="4" UNIT="appendix page"/> Master came not near her again until the 3d day, and then he ordered another hole to be made in the Ship, but would not be perswaded by Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> to stay and bring his men to help to save the Goods, but promised him Salvage. <HI>Vide</HI> his Affi∣davit.</P>
<P><HI>Timothy Murphy</HI> swore, That he was present on the 30th of <HI>January,</HI> when the Master desi∣red <MILESTONE N="43" UNIT="appendix page"/> <HI>Mr. Orpen</HI> to go and save what he could; <MILESTONE N="35" UNIT="appendix page"/> that himself was one of the Persons employ'd by
<PB N="39" REF="23"/> Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> to go on board, who went accord∣ingly, and loosed the fore-top-sail, and placed a Man at the Helm, and so brought her safe to the Creek; that the Persons which the Master pre∣tends were employ'd by himself, went not on board until the next morning; and had not Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> defended her from the Rabble, they had torn her to pieces; That the Seamen broke open the Hatches, and made havock of the Indigo, and of the best of the Goods.</P>
<P>There were 14 Witnesses more on the Tra∣versers behalves; but <HI>Bryen Kelly</HI> being snubb'd in Court by the high Sh. for giving any Evi∣dence in favour of the Traversers, and the rest of Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI>'s Witnesses being frighted by the Warrant for the pretended Felony, they held their Tongues, for fear that Mr. <HI>Bl.</HI> whom they suspected had contrived to have them thus falsly accused, should with no less just prosecution pre∣vail to have them Arraigned and Tryed for their Lives; fore-thinking that whoever had gone so far into such a Ford, would leave nothing unat∣tempted to wade quite thorow, to the utter Ru∣ine, if not of their Persons, at least of their Purses.</P>
<P>By thus much you may plainly perceive, how far the <HI>Presents</HI> made by the Master had prevail∣ed: And though the Lord chief Justice gave him such a scope of delivering himself, as might satis∣fie the World that all Gates were open for Stran∣gers to come before his Lordship for Justice; yet
<PB N="40" REF="24"/> the whole Court took notice how he fetter'd him∣self in his own Discourse: For being ask'd by his Lordship <HI>why he refused the Assistance of a great <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="appendix page"/> many English and their boats, and would not suffer them to bring off his Ship?</HI> He answered, <HI>That 'twas a most dismal stormy night, and so dark, that a man could not see his hand.</HI> Whereupon Mr <HI>Orpen</HI> cry'd out for an Almanack, and proved it to be full Moon, and the Witnesses proved it a <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="appendix page"/> most Glorious calm Night, and that the Ship fleeted every Tyde; and against his alledging that she had five foot water in her when she struck first, 'Twas prov'd, that she was tyght, and that the Water stunk, being the infallible Sign that there was no manner of leak; whereto he reply'd, <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="appendix page"/> (for want of other excuse) That the Sugar made it stink; The like reason was never heard before, for Sugar in divers things is as great a Preserva∣tive as Salt; and where it is so much less than any liquid Body, as that it cannot reach to a Sy∣rup or Conserve, (if it does at least to a relish) it never fails to set it upon the ferment, even al∣tho' it were the very worst of Sugars: These and such-like Absurdities were past by in Court, with∣out any manner of Correction or Carp, he being a Stranger.</P>
<P>But the Jury soon returned to the Court with two Verdicts to this Indictment; First, That <HI>Crump</HI> was not Guilty of any thing, but <HI>Orpen</HI> was Guilty of the whole Cargo, except the Lyme Juice, though indicted only at the Suit of <HI>Peter
<PB N="41" REF="24" MS="y"/> Row</HI> for two Hogsheads of Sugar and eight of Lyme Juice; Secondly, That he was Guilty of two Hogshe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds of Sugar, and no more; Though it doth not appear by the Examination of <HI>Peter Row,</HI> or any other Examination taken hitherto, that <HI>Peter Row</HI> ever had any Sugar in that Ship; but Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> told the Court that he hop't that one Verdict was Sufficient to one Indictment; whereto the Sh. answered, <HI>Another time, Mr. Or∣pen, another time.</HI> But the Witnesses for Mr. <HI>Or∣pen,</HI> <MILESTONE N="32" UNIT="appendix page"/> who were brought in for the pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Felony, <MILESTONE N="34" UNIT="appendix page"/> were not indicted nor question'd. Though there <MILESTONE N="35" UNIT="appendix page"/> wanted not mallice enough to do it; yet Mr. <HI>Or∣pen</HI> <MILESTONE N="32" UNIT="appendix page"/> (by reason that his wittnesses were Snubb'd and Frighted) had no manner of liberty for a fair Tryal, by which means the Court Remain∣ed misinform'd of the whole affair. And observe how eagerly they follow these irregular proceed∣ings. The Master, Captain <HI>Gregory,</HI> Major <HI>Steers,</HI> &amp;c. met together soon afterwards in <HI>Dublin,</HI> and upon their consult, a Writ mark'd ten thousand pounds, was taken out of the Kings Bench against Mr. <HI>Orpen,</HI> at the Masters Suit; so that he that was lately but principal Evidence, is now made Plaintiff.</P>
<P>Consider how naturally the Master Swore at the Tryal to carry on a cause wherein he design'd that himself should be Plaintiff afterwards; Mark that, with the Rest. But least Bail should be given in to the Action, they prepared another Ex∣pedient, (being the last Shift common to turbu∣lent
<PB N="42" REF="25"/> Spirits) That is, to Accuse a man falsly into some plot or conspiracy against the Government, which they intended should admit of no Bail. Thereby to plague him further with Imprison∣ment and Expence, until he could obtain a Try∣al. And the better to accomplish this barbar∣ous design, they passed by the late Commission o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer,</HI> and framed a new and a mos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unnatural Accusation against him, viz. <HI>That h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had Traiterously contrived the Burning of (his Fa∣ther-in-law's)</HI> Mr. Palmer<HI>'s House;</HI> and in orde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thereunto they procured a Warrant of Treason, from one of the Judges of the said Kings Bench, against him.</P>
<P>And in fine, the Sh. made him Prisone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon the writ and the warrant, and for the further suppression of Justice, and to carry on their design<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> against him with the more facility, they have provided fresh warrants of Felony to hamper an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at will to aw all those who they think may serve as witnesses for him, and have promised great rewards to such as will swear on their side.</P>
<P>While he is in custody, their Agent is very buisie about taking away all the goods that were saved, and the Sh. stands by to grant Replevins, if in case that any of the goods should be stopt for Salvage. But to make sure work, and to pre∣vent <HI>Orpen's</HI> bringing Actions against the same, he is hurryd away by the Sh. and their Agent hurrys the goods away as fast, without giving Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> any manner of satisfaction for saving
<PB N="43" REF="25"/> the Ship and goods; Notwithstanding that its plainly proved, that all had been lost had not he and his men taken upon them to save and defend the same as appears under the hands and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="appendix page"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aths of those very people whom the Master <MILESTONE N="15" UNIT="appendix page"/> pretends were employed by himself, and turned <MILESTONE N="16" UNIT="appendix page"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut by Mr. <HI>Orpen,</HI> and by the oaths not only of <MILESTONE N="17" UNIT="appendix page"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he most indifferent or mean people, but like∣vvise <MILESTONE N="22" UNIT="appendix page"/> of the most credible Gentlemen of that <MILESTONE N="26" UNIT="appendix page"/> Country, against whom we may hear perad∣venture that Warrants of Felony will be issu'd, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd others Tamper'd with, as soon as it's un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erstood that they can evidence for Mr. <HI>Orpen.</HI></P>
<P>And that this is no more than what has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lready Attempted, will appear by the following Affidavit.</P>

<P>This Affidavit is a Sample of the contrivances now on foot concerning a wedge of Gold, which Mr. <HI>Myars</HI> pretends he threw aside under the bed when the Toryes entred the house; and by the Philosophers Stone revers'd was turned into Brass. But whether he threw it there or not, there was a lump of Metal taken up among the rubbish, and being delivered to M. <HI>Myars,</HI> he did at several times in the hearing of several Gentlemen, own and declare that it was the same lump or wedge which he had throwne by, and described it by the colour, shape, and size, and by several private marks, and particularly by two specks or bubbles upon the upper surface thereof; Now whether he left any such lump there as he pretends; or
<PB N="46" REF="27"/> whether he would not, if he thought 'twere Gold, have laid his Challenge to any lump, were it the right one or no; or whether, if it were the right one, he had not a mind to deceive the right owner of it, and so caused a counterfeit to be made after∣wards; or whether he was cheated in <HI>Jamaica,</HI> is yet a question; But it admitts of this discourse, that it's very manifest that the piece or lump which was delivered by Mr. <HI>Mabury</HI> to Mr. <HI>Myars,</HI> carryed the several marks and specks upon the upper-side or upper surface, as the true piece had, which is indeed an infallible assurance (if Mr. <HI>Myars</HI> description were true) that it is the right piece, be it Gold, Brass, or any other Metal whatever; For though its in the power of any ordinary capacity that can run Metals, to imitate in some sort in the bottom sides or ends of the Counterfeit the marks of the true Piece, yet the specks, or bubbles, or any other mark upon the upper surface, are accidentals in casting, (and in a coat as different from the rest, as the upper coun∣tenance of a Pann-pudding differeth from every part of the Geometricall superficies of the sides and bottom) and not to be imitated by the best of Artists; and for further satisfaction in this point, Enquire at all the Laboratories and Foun∣deries within Humane management, and they will tell you that its as impossible to raise <HI>(ad libitum)</HI> a single bubble or two (or more properly hony-comb) of exact shape and place upon the upper surface (that side only in such flat castings
<PB N="47" REF="27"/> being lyable to this kind of windy sputter) as it is in the power of a Physician to lay a well man to bedd and bring a small pox through his Skin in exact numbers where and when he pleases; and what man will take two pails of water of equal Cylinder and Depth, and having set out upon the margins the 32 points with their Aliquots, and by the plounce of a Pebble-stone having raised a bubble accidentally in one of the pails, shall afterwards undertake that in the dropping a thousand pebbles more into the other pail, to raise a single bubble of exact shape point and distance from the Center, with the former? And if he ever accomplisheth it, he may afterwards say that its a thousand times more impossible to raise <HI>(ad libitum)</HI> in any Counterfeit a hony comb of exact depth, shape, and place, with the copy. Notwithstanding that Ca. <HI>Greg.</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bl.</HI> were unsuccessfull in their adventure if they designed to lay out their twenty pounds a piece with <HI>Edward Dunigan</HI> for this intended subor∣nation, which in some parts of the Kingdom, and among some sort of folks, migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> perhaps have pur∣chased a Post-knight for every pound, especially when a poor man is threatned to be hang'd if he refuses to swear what is desired; yet they were cautious of laying out their money with every man, being as supposed only in trust for the Master and Passengers, who perhaps would not allow of the charge, unless they saw the value thereof in good Thundering Oaths, such as
<PB N="48" REF="28"/> would lay to the ground all whom they had de∣signed for the slaughter, to save their own Cre∣dits; so that not above two or three of the Coun∣try are yet got to Swear, upon this particular; one being a Black-Smith, and a very boon Com∣panion at the Pot and Noggin, and has often join∣ed with the Minister <HI>Fervently</HI> in that sort, and sometimes it has been observed that a few Pots of Ale shall prevail more with a drunken Fellow, than Tvventy Pounds vvith another. This Fellovv has svvorn, as it's said, That Mr. <HI>Mabu∣ry</HI> ask'd him, <HI>Could he cast a Piece of Brass of some certain size or shape, which would serve his turn?</HI> Or to that effect. But this Affidavit being a very slight one, its supposed to be no more than the price of some small Reckoning at the Alehouse. But if he swears thus far it self for nothing, or in <HI>Forma Pauperis,</HI> what will his Affidavit be, when the Minister shall receive Orders from his Owners to lay out the Tvventy Pounds? Do they play upon the Easiness of his soft Temper? Or vvill they use him as the Blind do a Staff, vvhich they thrust out before them to grope out their vvay among the Sloughs, to save their Feet from the Mire, and their Heads from knocking against the Walls?</P>
<P>And though that the many Allegations and Assertions herein mentioned, can be proved by divers good Gentlemen, Yet to avoid too great a volumn at present, take only this Small Ap∣pendix as a relish of what the whole Country ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="49" REF="28"/> Eye wittnesses of, and can manifest to be true, whilest his Enemyes are in the mean time, con∣triving by their dark devices, to take away Mr. <HI>Orpen's</HI> life; for no less then that, can be lookt upon as Satisfaction, for such soul Crimes where∣of he stands now accused; But their Mountain-belly'd conceptions ended only in an abortive Mouse, for having brought him Seven-Score miles in custody upon this Warrant of Treason into the Court of Kings Bench, Mr. <HI>Myars</HI> was there present, and made no less violent pro∣secution against him, then Mr. <HI>Bl.</HI> had done for∣merly against the 14 Wittnesses upon the pre∣tended Felony, who after they were apprehend∣ed and brought in, had not a word to say against them: But Mr. <HI>Myars</HI> took an occasion to slip away immediately out of Court, and so out of the Kingdom; Leaving the Judges of the Land to consider the horridness of his Judaical Informa∣tions; <HI>Tu fixo aculeo fugis:</HI> and so the Treason came to nothing, save that Mr. <HI>Myars</HI> Savour'd [of a False Informer] in the nostrills of common Justice.

<P>Lest his great Provocations might carry Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> into insufficient Arguments, as to his own Vindication. or into less becoming words as to the Authors of his Sufferings, he shew'd his Pape<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to several of his Friends; one whereof sent him the following Letter.</P>

<P>They that accused my Wittnesses for Felony, and my self for Treason, having plaid <HI>Bo-Peep</HI> with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Government and the Laws, whereby I live, may oppress me too; <HI>Sed nemo me impune Laces∣sit;</HI>
<PB N="52" REF="30"/> If I am hurt by popular Rage; I am not the first; I, that have received <HI>Good things,</HI> must be content to take my share of the <HI>Evill</HI> also; If stormes of Injustice for pretended Felonyes and Treasons, or other vexations, should continue, I shall admire at the long suffering of God, and Sing <HI>Evigila Domine, quare Dormires,</HI> &amp;c. But the Judges who will understand the Justness of my Cause by the true Harmony of my Clamours; will be Just, when many dare not venture to be so.</P>
<P>You have perus'd my Narrative, and yet you wonder at my Enemyes impetuousness against me; Don't you plain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y perceive that its mostly for these three Reasons?</P>
<P>First, <HI>Because I have saved what they had re∣solved to destroy, whereby they are exposed for ever.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>They would revengfully deprive me of my Salvage, which after all their Juggles, will be allow'd me by the Law; Since that the Ship and the Salvable part of the Goods are Sav∣ed</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>They would prevent my having any Publique Employment;</HI> but they are highly mis∣taken; for I desire none, while any of these are to be my Yoak-fellows.</P>
<P>I owne my self highly obliged for your kind Re∣mark (*) But when its understood how nearly I am related to more then a few <HI>Ministers;</HI> I presume that it will not be easy to win any man to believe, That I mean reflection on their Order; I, that have

Since I averr it, that he hath made a Gentleman priso∣ner at the Suit of another: and that some of his Parishoners have slighted the <HI>Church,</HI> and dare not come to the <HI>Holy Communion,</HI> for fear of being <HI>Clap't upon the Shoulder</HI> by the Ghostly Father. So that as for Mr. <HI>Bl.</HI> and the <HI>Jew,</HI> or any other Professors, who Labour by such indirect methods to be what they would be, and so manifestly abuse what they should be, I would have it known, that I contemn them, and do not in the least fear the con∣sequences of declaring it; I have no such guilt as may compel me to daub with any such persons, and do call to God and all good men for Judgment.</P>
<P>And by <HI>London-Master,</HI> in the Title-page, Mr. <HI>Lyel</HI> only is singled at, for his singular Skill in Au∣gur-holes; I have had the good fortune of being acquainted with many of the <HI>London-Masters,</HI> and understood them to be Gentlemen of good Reason and Sence, and most able Artists, and too ingenious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o imagine that ever I should designe the least.

<P>But why should you think that any of the Army would resent my holding of Cap. <HI>Gregorye'</HI>s Glass before him? I am confident, I stand well with them, or at least with so many as know me; for when I was employed by his Grace the late <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Schomberg,</HI> and afterwards by the Government to command the Artillary-shipping, I kept the Coast to and fro, as the Army advanced and retired, during the late War, and furnished them duely from Sea; and so I did the Sea-port Garrisons; which I performed from time to time, to the satisfaction of the Government, and the Generall Officers, as by their ample Certificats may appear; I don't Re∣member that I have said, or meant any thing that even malice it self can wrest, to the disrelish of the meanest Just Man in the Kings pay; But if a particular Cap. or so, should come obstreperously in my way, with design to have me beaten out into a <HI>Whim-wham for a Horse-Mill;</HI> I hope that others of the Army will not judge me rude at the Table, if I hold the <HI>Brimmer</HI> to his Nose, and make him drink as himself has brew'd.

<P>DUring the whole Transaction hitherto, an Examination of <HI>Jacob Myars,</HI> the <HI>Jew,</HI> taken before the Honourable Sr. <HI>Henry Ecclin,</HI> one of the Barrons of Their Majesties Court of Exchequer in <HI>Ireland,</HI> upon the 7th of <HI>March</HI> 1693, was kept private from Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> until about the last of <HI>May</HI> following, that the Copy thereof came to his hands from his friend in <HI>Lon∣don.</HI> The reason of this great privacy, was, be∣cause the same contained the main grounds of incensing the Government; and Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> was not to know the Contents thereof, least he should too early Answer it, and so ruine a Design yet in Embryo, before it had received its birth into the world. Here you have that most abomina∣ble Examination in its distinct Paragraphs, with the several Remarks inherent thereto, respect∣tively, Viz.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I. This Examinate saith, That on the 28 of <HI>January</HI> last past, the Ship <HI>Laurel of London,</HI> burthen 150 Tunns, Captain <HI>Christopher Lyell</HI> Commander, from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> bound for <HI>London,</HI> was drove into the River of <HI>Killmare</HI> in the County of <HI>Kerry,</HI> by distress of weather, and very heafy, that the Ships Crew could hardly perceive any land, onely the tops of the Mountains.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> They were four Leagues to the west of the <HI>Bull, Cow</HI> and <HI>Calfe,</HI> and took them for the <HI>Skellox,</HI> the wind at W. Was it distress or design that forced them into <HI>Killmare?</HI> she came into the River on the 27th, and Anchored at <HI>Ross∣more,</HI> about midway up the River; But the Ex∣aminate
<PB N="56" REF="32"/> says nothing of cutting the Cable, and driving from thence, and it was on the 28th a∣bout 7 in the Morning that she drove to <HI>Capana∣cossy,</HI> <MILESTONE N="11" UNIT="appendix page"/> near the uper end of the River; If by chance the Examinant has mislaid his Journall, its not so high a mistake, as when they saw nothing but the tops of the Mountains; whereas its the tops and upper parts of the Mountains that are al∣ways mostly covered in heasy weather, in that part of the Kingdom. <HI>Vide all the Historyes of Ireland.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II. And in the distress of weather, the Ship lost all her sailes, so that she could not be steer'd any longer, and the Commander of the said Ship, Crew and Passengers, hoist out the long boat and row'd ashore to save their lives; and on 7 a clock the same morning, they all came ashore, and travell'd on the land about two miles from the place where the Ship lay; and afterwards, found the said Ship drove in among the Rocks.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Diametrically Opposite, she had all her <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"/> Sayles, and very good Sayles too; <HI>Vide</HI> Affada∣vits <MILESTONE N="13" UNIT="appendix page"/> of <HI>Charles Mansfield, John Kelly, &amp;c.</HI> There <MILESTONE N="24" UNIT="appendix page"/> was no danger of their Lives or Ship, being got <MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="appendix page"/> into quiet water, and had they hoodwinkt her, she <MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="appendix page"/> had undoubtedly followed after the Long-boat <MILESTONE N="11" UNIT="appendix page"/> into <HI>Black Water,</HI> (right afore the wind) a ve∣ry <MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="appendix page"/> good Harbour, which being not for their <MILESTONE N="12" UNIT="appendix page"/> purpose, they made her look another way; and <MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="appendix page"/> contrary to their hopes, she hapened to come a∣shore <MILESTONE N="12" UNIT="appendix page"/> at <HI>Capanacossy</HI> upon easy ground, at low wa∣ter, where she toucht no Rocks; but drove to and <MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="appendix page"/> fro all day, with Flood and Ebb, before their
<PB N="57" REF="32"/> faces, while they made merry, and beheld her <MILESTONE N="12" UNIT="appendix page"/> close by them. What means the Examinant by <HI>Where she lay,</HI> for she lay no where until she drove to <HI>Cappanacossy,</HI> two miles from the place <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> where they all forsook her, where there was wa∣ter for a Ship of three times her burthen. What made them forsake her in such a place? when <MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="appendix page"/> she struck not in two miles from it; And being at <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="appendix page"/> low water, she drove on farther, along the strand <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> for want of dropping an Anchor; Not one word of the Treasure which they brought and carryed <MILESTONE N="13" UNIT="appendix page"/> by land to <HI>Cappanacossy,</HI> and divided among <MILESTONE N="7" UNIT="appendix page"/> themselves.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III. That about two of Clock in the afternoon the said Captain, Passengers, and all the Crew, returned on board; and the said Captain being informed that one <HI>Thomas Palmer,</HI> Clerk, and Justice of peace in that County, was near him, he wrote to him, to desire his assistance and advice to save him from the Irish Rabble; on which the said <HI>Palmer</HI> immediatly came down &amp; sent on Board a Corporal and five Soldiers, to guard them, which was all the assistance he said he could assist them with, and advised them to stay on Board, which they accordingly did, the storm yet continuing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> They returned not on board until the <MILESTONE N="13" UNIT="appendix page"/> Capt. had first writ, nor alter Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> came, <MILESTONE N="19" UNIT="appendix page"/> untill he (understanding that they had their <MILESTONE N="7" UNIT="appendix page"/> Treasure ashore with them) told them, that they were in danger of the Toryes; Then indeed, <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> they hastned into the Ship again, which was a∣bout Sunset; but dropt no Anchor to stop her, <MILESTONE N="8" UNIT="appendix page"/> as she drove down again with the Ebb; the Master in his Letter seemed to be in great distress, <MILESTONE N="31" UNIT="appendix page"/>
<PB N="58" REF="33"/> and that he had not a Sail left; would any Ma∣ster, if his Ship was not in a willful distress, stand <MILESTONE N="13" UNIT="appendix page"/> ashore, and behold her all day driving to and fro, <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"/> and pretend he had not a Saile left, when she <MILESTONE N="25" UNIT="appendix page"/> had all her Sails? Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> did promise more asistance then the Corporal and five Soldiers, and <MILESTONE N="29" UNIT="appendix page"/> accordingly sent Men and Boats that evening <MILESTONE N="19" UNIT="appendix page"/> (being fine and calm, and not stormy, as the Examinant says) But the Master would not Suf∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the Ship to be brought off; Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> told <MILESTONE N="12" UNIT="appendix page"/> them their Ship was the best Garison in the Coun∣try, and advised them to stick to their Ship, but <MILESTONE N="8" UNIT="appendix page"/> they all forsook her again next morning; Except the Master, Gunner, and Carpenter.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV. The next morning (being the 29th of <HI>January</HI>) they all thought it most convenient, for the saving of their lives and mony, the Ship lying so very dangerously between the Rocks, that some of them should go ashore and carry the mony with them to the said Mr <HI>Palmer's</HI> house; and that accordingly this Deponent, and the rest of the Passengers, and a few of the Ships Crew, brought the mony ashore, about 12 a clock, to the said Mr. <HI>Palmer's</HI> house at <HI>Needen,</HI> and on the account of the Captain and themselves, desired the said Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> to shelter the same; which did amount, in pieces of Eight and Wedges of Gold, to the value of 2500 <HI>l.</HI> or thereabouts, which he accordingly did.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> They must needs think it convenient <MILESTONE N="12" UNIT="appendix page"/> to go ashore to secure the Mony, when they had <MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="appendix page"/> resolved to destroy the Ship; otherwise there <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="appendix page"/> was no danger of either that or their lives, upon easy ground and calm water, and the Ship Fleet∣ing every Tyde; Does the Examinate call it but
<PB N="59" REF="33"/> a few of the Ships Crew, when they left but two of the Crew on board? And they did not ac∣quaint <MILESTONE N="25" UNIT="appendix page"/> Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> with the Treasure in the Chests, until after the house was burnt and Robb'd. <MILESTONE N="43" UNIT="appendix page"/> </P>
<P N="5"><HI>V. That the said Examinate was ordered by the said Captain to desire the said <HI>Palmer</HI> to come downe to the Ship, to advise him the best way for saving the Ship and Cargo; who accordingly went down with one Mr <HI>Richard Orpen</HI> his son-in law; and sent the said <HI>Orpen</HI> on board to advise with the Captain; whose Advice was that the said Captain should send his Gunns ashore, which he re∣fused to do, saying it would disable him from the com∣mon Enemy, (the <HI>French</HI>) who not long before, had taken two Ships out of that River.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> When Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> went on board, he try'd the Pump, and found that the water in the Ship was dirty and stunk, whereupon he told the Mast∣er <MILESTONE N="24" UNIT="appendix page"/> his Ship was Tyght, and that he would have her off forthwith; and advised the Master to pre∣pare to put out the heavy Goods from aloft, as her Guns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the Master could not abide to <MILESTONE N="24" UNIT="appendix page"/> hear of putting his Guns ashore, for fear of the <MILESTONE N="25" UNIT="appendix page"/> enemy; Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> told him that a Battery on the shore, within Pistol Shot of the Ship, would do much better, and small Arms would do much better on board. For the Enemy could not attack him any way, but in their boats. But the Master would not hearken to it; Though his <MILESTONE N="24" UNIT="appendix page"/> Guns lay at that time (and so they have ever since) useless, heads-and-points along-Ships. Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> askt him about his Anchors, and how he rid? The Master answered, By a small Kedger that <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> had a Warp to it; That his best Bower was lost;
<PB N="60" REF="34"/> That his sheet Anchor wanted a stock. Then Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> desired him to send his Carpenter a shore, <MILESTONE N="25" UNIT="appendix page"/> to make a stock, and Shewed him where there was good Timber within pistol Shot of the Ship, and that he would set some of the Country Car∣penters <MILESTONE N="22" UNIT="appendix page"/> to work with them, and fit up a stock in an hours time; but the Master could not abide <MILESTONE N="24" UNIT="appendix page"/> to hear of it. While they were thus discoursing; <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> the Ship Fleeted, which Mr <HI>Orpen</HI> observed to the Master, but the Master (though 'twas fine Weather) Excus'd the not getting her away that <MILESTONE N="24" UNIT="appendix page"/> tyde, saying, that all his men (except the Gun∣ner <MILESTONE N="8" UNIT="appendix page"/> and Carpenter) were ashore at Mr. <HI>Palmer's.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><HI>VI. That the said Captain agreed with Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> to send him seven or eight Long Boats to unload part of the Cargo, whereby the said Ship might be lightned; and so with the first opportunity of a moderate wind and high water, be got off from the said Rocks.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> without any agreement, <MILESTONE N="19" UNIT="appendix page"/> onely his promise, sent several Boats well mann'd; but the Master would not suffer them to bring his Ship to a safe harbour; but pack't them away again as soon as he understood that they were re∣solved <MILESTONE N="29" UNIT="appendix page"/> to save her. And for opportunityes of <MILESTONE N="19" UNIT="appendix page"/> Wind and Tyde, there wanted none; if her driv∣ing <MILESTONE N="14" UNIT="appendix page"/> up and down with Flood and Ebb the first <MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="appendix page"/> day, and her fleeting every Tyde afterwards, in <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="appendix page"/> mild Weather, were Opportunityes; as for Rocks, <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> she toucht none, until after the Master and all had forsaken her, on the 30th of <HI>January,</HI> and <MILESTONE N="17" UNIT="appendix page"/> then the wind arose hard at S. W. upon which op∣portunity <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"/> the Master made three holes in her bot∣tom, and turn'd her a drift.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="61" REF="34"/><HI>VII. That the Examinate, with the rest of the passengers, and some of the crew, being in the said <HI>Palmers</HI> house about 12 a clock of night, the Torys or Rapparees came and set the house on fire upon them, which as they supposed were upwards of sixty in number, and shott in upon them throw the windows and doors, so that they were forced to rise out of their beds and defended themselves about a quarter of an hour, but the fierceness of the fire increased, and they were forced to break open the doors to save their lives, and immediatly the Torys entred the house, brought out the Chest and opened it, and took all the mony that was in it; and stript this Examinate and some of the passen∣gers, of their very Shirts, and beat them extreamly.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Now when the house was set on fire and Robb'd, Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> was made to understand that this great Treasure was brought into the house <MILESTONE N="43" UNIT="appendix page"/> in the Chests, but never before; which if they had but told him of sooner, he might have sav∣ed all, and prevented his owne ruine, there being a party of 30 Soldiers quarter'd contiguous to his house.</P>
<P N="8"><HI>VIII. That on the 30th in the morning the Captain came ashore to see what was become of the passengers, and left the Ship with an Anchor and Cable out to keep her from floating, and orderd the Carpenter to bore two or three holes in the Bottom of her, to hinder her from rising where she lay, that she might not float and beat against the Rocks; for by that means the Ship would lye safe, which was accordingly done, the lower Tyre of the Sugar being all wasted by the leakiness of the Ship in her voyage, and the rest of the Sugar lying high with the Indigo and Cotten, Ginger, and Logwood, Fustick, and Roman Vittrioll, could come to no damage by boring of the holes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The Examinant was sadly put to it to find an excuse for the Masters forsaking the Ship,
<PB N="62" REF="35"/> <HI>To see what was become of the Passengers,</HI> as tho he had past a Bill of Lading for them, and for fear he had lost them, he goes ashore to get a receipt for their bodyes, Leaving the whole Ship and Cargo to a Mob, whose mercyes are very crueltyes, <MILESTONE N="17" UNIT="appendix page"/> without riding her by any Cable, Warp, or any <MILESTONE N="19" UNIT="appendix page"/> thing whatsoever; And to prevent her driving, <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="appendix page"/> he caused the Warp whereby she rid, to be slipt; And to Preserve the Sugars, Indigo, Cotton, Vi∣triol, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he order'd three holes to be bor'd tho∣row <MILESTONE N="22" UNIT="appendix page"/> her bottom, as she lay in three foot water at low water, and Flows 12 foot more at high wa∣ter; the most modern fashion now extant to pre∣serve a rich Cargo in a Ship that is but ten foot in the hold; and the poor lower Tyre (forsooth) exactly condemned as lost before she came there, <MILESTONE N="22" UNIT="appendix page"/> by her leakiness, though the water stunk in her <MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="appendix page"/> when she arrived there. But this was done to pre∣vent <MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="appendix page"/> her beating against the Rocks whereon she lay, whereas she toucht not a Rock until after the Master had turned her loose; But if he had been well practic'd in Water-Clock-work, he might the better have understood how many inch-and-quar∣ter augur-holes, are requisite in so many hours be¦fore next high water to fill the lower Tyer, if it were empty, and if he knew how much the same would contain; But for want of Judgment in such branches of the Mathematicks, and to avoid the exactness of the triplicit augur-holes, you may perhaps hear, that in his next trick, he will contrive <HI>(willfully by mischance)</HI> to have
<PB N="63" REF="35"/> three Guns fired at once thorow her hold, and then he need not doubt her speedy Sinking.</P>
<P N="9"><HI>IX. That the Captain advised with the Examinate who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they should do to save the said Ship and Cargo from the Rabble and Toryes, and thereupon they thought fit to desire O <HI>Sulivan More,</HI> Captain <HI>Carthy,</HI> Mr. <HI>Aldwell,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> two English Protestants, to go on board to secure the said Ship and Cargo from the Toryes, O <HI>Sulivan</HI> and Captain <HI>Carthy,</HI> of the Irish the head in that Country, and this deponent beleeves that by that means to prevent the meaner sort from useing any violence, That the said four persons went accordingly on board and promised to secure the Ship and Cargo, having an order from the Cap∣tain, and an instrument under his hand to have the one half for the Salvage.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> They had it seems pack'd the Cards be∣fore they could well hide the cheat, and without <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> doubt advised with one another in all secrecy <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="appendix page"/> how to make a shew of innocence, and since the <MILESTONE N="15" UNIT="appendix page"/> mony to their <HI>greif</HI> was all lost, and the Ship to their <HI>disgrace</HI> safe in a Creek, It remained now how to blind the owners and the world, that they might not see the mony carryed ashore with any other then a harmless intention to save it; and to manifest their industry, he says, that these four persons employ'd, went aboard; But had not Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> sent Mr. <HI>Kelly</HI> to have them named in the instrument for Salvage, as in trust for him the said <HI>Orpen,</HI> and as his friends, It's presumed that <MILESTONE N="11" UNIT="appendix page"/> the Master had never thought of them. But none of the said persons went on board in that manner as the Examinat speaks of, for Capt. <HI>Carthy,</HI> and <MILESTONE N="16" UNIT="appendix page"/> Mr. <HI>Aldwell</HI> went not aboard until the next morn∣ing
<PB N="64" REF="36"/> after the Master had deserted her, &amp; until af∣ter <MILESTONE N="26" UNIT="appendix page"/> the Ship was (to his shame) brought safe to the Creek by others employ'd under Mr. <HI>Orpen;</HI> Mr. <MILESTONE N="23" UNIT="appendix page"/> <HI>Clarke</HI> came not near her in ten days after, O <HI>Su∣livan <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="appendix page"/> More</HI> knew not any thing of the matter, <MILESTONE N="15" UNIT="appendix page"/> and never came at all to her, neither was he em∣ployed <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="appendix page"/> or desired by any body whatever to be <MILESTONE N="15" UNIT="appendix page"/> concerned, as appears by his and the rest of the <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="appendix page"/> Affidavits.</P>
<P N="10"> <MILESTONE N="23" UNIT="appendix page"/> <HI>X. That after they went on board, they confest they found all things in good order save 2 barrels of Indigo which the Captain brought ashore, and one hogshead of Indigo, whereof some part was taken out.</HI></P>
<P> <MILESTONE N="29" UNIT="appendix page"/> <HI>Answ.</HI> What a confession is here exprest by the Examinat, when that the Master in open Court declared upon Oath, and as you see by the Affi∣davits <MILESTONE N="25" UNIT="appendix page"/> of several good Gentlemen, that there were eleven (some barrels, some hogsheads) of <MILESTONE N="4" UNIT="appendix page"/> Indigo brought from Shipboard along with the <MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="appendix page"/> Master when he forsook her, Every thing was in <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="appendix page"/> a monstrous good order when the water was with∣in <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"/> a foot and half of the Beam, and the Ship Plun∣dered <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> by her own men, and that by the Exami∣nats <MILESTONE N="23" UNIT="appendix page"/> order.</P>
<P N="11"><HI>XI. That the same night the said <HI>Orpen,</HI> and one Mr. <HI>Thomas Crump</HI> along with him, came on board the Ship, and demanded of the said O <HI>Sulivan More,</HI> by what authority they came on board, who thereupon shew'd them their order from the Captain; But the said <HI>Orpen</HI> and <HI>Crump</HI> forced the said order from them, and seized the said Ship and Cargo, the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Orpen</HI> for the Admiralty, and <HI>Crump</HI> for the King; the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id <HI>Orpen</HI> producing a Broad Seal, and turned the men ashore which frightned them away.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>minant runs on with a most
<PB N="65" REF="36"/> chymerical Concatenation of falsityes; For 'twas in the morning that <HI>Orpen</HI> and <HI>Crump</HI> went on board; and how was O <HI>Sulivan More</HI> Demanded <MILESTONE N="16" UNIT="appendix page"/> to produce his order, and how was the same taken <MILESTONE N="23" UNIT="appendix page"/> from him; who never went near the Ship and <MILESTONE N="15" UNIT="appendix page"/> never was employed or desired by any person to <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="appendix page"/> be concerned; and how then was O <HI>Sulivan <MILESTONE N="15" UNIT="appendix page"/> More</HI> turned ashore that never was on board, and <MILESTONE N="26" UNIT="appendix page"/> Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> that came not near her until ten dayes <MILESTONE N="16" UNIT="appendix page"/> after, and Mr. <HI>Aldwell</HI> and Capt. <HI>Carthy,</HI> who came not till next morning and were then em∣ploy'd by Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> to help to save the Goods: But now comes the dead doing Blow, <HI>Orpen for the Admiralty, and Crump for the King, Seized the Ship; and Orpen shewed a Broad Seal.</HI> O Ter∣rible peice! what necessity for a broad Seal after <MILESTONE N="15" UNIT="appendix page"/> his People and Servants had brought her safe to <MILESTONE N="23" UNIT="appendix page"/> the Creek by virtue of the power which the Mast∣er <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="appendix page"/> gave him the day before? Neither did <HI>Orpen</HI> <MILESTONE N="9" UNIT="appendix page"/> perform one Ceremony that belongs to a Seisure, yet there was indeed an old broad Seal produced, which was not against any right Claymant, But to encourage the men to their arms, against the <MILESTONE N="23" UNIT="appendix page"/> intruding Rabble and Rapparees, as appears by <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"/> Mr. <HI>Orpen's</HI> discourse to the Master when he re∣turned <MILESTONE N="28" UNIT="appendix page"/> to her, which was not until 3 days after she <MILESTONE N="4" UNIT="appendix page"/> was brought into the Creek by Mr. <HI>Orpen's</HI> men, <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="appendix page"/> who then desired the Master to stay in his Ship, and bring his men to save the Goods; adding <MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="appendix page"/> that one Seaman, was worth five Landmen upon <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="appendix page"/> such Service, but the Master thereupon hastned away all his men out of the Country.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="66" REF="37"/><HI>XII. That when they left the Ship they gave charge to the said <HI>Orpen</HI> and <HI>Crump</HI> to take care of the goods being in the condition they found them in as aforesaid, and then went to the Captain, and gave him an account of what was done, who the next morning, with several of his men, went a board and demanded the reason of their proceedings. But they turned the Captain and his men ashore, and quite dispossest him, having seized her as afore∣said; The Captain charged them to take care of her, and not to imbezle the Cargo on board, for that they should be accountable for it and their proceedings. But they answerd him that he needed not to concern himself, he neither had nor should have any thing to do with it.</HI></P>
<P> <MILESTONE N="15" UNIT="appendix page"/> <HI>Answ.</HI> He goes on still with the same thred <MILESTONE N="16" UNIT="appendix page"/> of his first spinning; when did <HI>O Sulivan More</HI> <MILESTONE N="26" UNIT="appendix page"/> and Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> leave the Ship, that were not near <MILESTONE N="16" UNIT="appendix page"/> her, and when did Captain <HI>Carthy</HI> and Mr. <HI>Ald∣wel</HI> leave her, that went not aboard till after she was safe in the Creek, and were employed all along by Mr. <HI>Orpen;</HI> and the Master went not to the Ship in the morning, but in the afternoon, being the third day after he had deserted her; neither had he of his men along with him any more then the Gunner, who was one of the prin∣cipal Caballers about boring the holes; and though the Examinate says that they were quite dispossest; Its manifest they were earnestly intrea∣ted, <MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="appendix page"/> especially the Master, to stay on board and <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> bring all his Men to help to work; but he would not be advised, which is directly contrary to what the Examinat swears. Its true he attended so long <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> as vvhile he filled about half a dozen baggs vvith the best Sugars, and carryed the same with him to his quarters.</P>
<P N="13"><PB N="67" REF="37"/><HI>XIII. That the next day this deponent saw several hundred horse-loads coming from the said Ship, loaded with part of the Cargo belonging to the said Ship, by the said <HI>Orpen</HI> and <HI>Crumps</HI> order; and this Examinat sayth, that he was told by several who bought thereof, that the said <HI>Orpen</HI> and <HI>Crump</HI> disposed and sold the said goods to every one that would buy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Tis very probable that the Examinate savv some horses, but not one hundred, laden vvith the Ships goods; The greatest part vvhere∣of <MILESTONE N="23" UNIT="appendix page"/> vvere vvith goods sold and disposed by her <MILESTONE N="29" UNIT="appendix page"/> ovvn men, and some vvere laden avvay vvith <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"/> Logvvood to the store houses appointed by Mr. <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="appendix page"/> <HI>Orpen,</HI> and others carryed avvay the Sugar in great quantityes, vvhich the Master gave them vvhile he vvas aboard. But its not in the povver of man to say that <HI>Orpen</HI> or <HI>Crump</HI> sold a penny vvorth of the vvhole Cargo, though hundred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> will prove that the Master, Passengers, and seamen, <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="appendix page"/> made havock thereof to every one that would <MILESTONE N="23" UNIT="appendix page"/> buy, and never exceeded Robin-hoods penny <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> worths.</P>
<P N="14"><HI>XIV. And the said <HI>Crump</HI> being Officer for the King, forgave the buyers the duty and discharged them thereof; and also gave them Permitts, and that the said <HI>Crump</HI> and <HI>Orpen</HI> sent eight horse-load of the said goods (as this Examinat is inform'd) to <HI>Kinsale</HI> to Captain <HI>John Waller</HI> Deputy Governour of <HI>Charles-fort.</HI></HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> What paines would not the Examinat undertake to out the Kings officer, or any one that had a hand in saving vvhat they vvould have destroy'd; at length he performs it vvith this most execrable assertion, that he had forgiven the
<PB N="68" REF="38"/> Kings duty, and gave Permits, the onely taking thing to turne him our, vvho vvas never guilty of any such behaviour, and before the Wars vvas employ'd for 20 Years together, and for his faith∣fullness and integrity, vvas in very great esteem with his Superior Officers; Nor does the Exami∣nat regard how he bespatters any person of what vvorth or quality soever to rid himself and Crevv of that indelible spatter vvhich they vvill never be rid of; The Lt. Governour of <HI>Charles-Fort,</HI> who is known to be a person of Honour, and ab∣hors any dirty action, must be brought into the story for eight horse-load of Goods sent him; and <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="appendix page"/> is as true, as that O <HI>Sulivan More</HI> was turned out <MILESTONE N="15" UNIT="appendix page"/> of the Ship, which he never Saw.</P>
<P N="15"><HI>XV. And that the said <HI>Orpen</HI> sent several boat loads of the said goods up the River to his own House, and other places, by which proceedings of <HI>Orpen</HI> and <HI>Crump,</HI> there is not visibly left the value of 500 <HI>l.</HI>'s worth of goods of all the said Cargo; Though at the time that the said <HI>Orpen</HI> and <HI>Crump</HI> took possession thereof, it was, and this Examinat beleeves to be worth between 5 and 6000 <HI>l.</HI> the whole damages sustained both as to Ship, Mony and Cargo, being about 10000 <HI>l.</HI></HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> A farr fetcht aggravation, <HI>That Orpen carryed some of the goods to his owne house.</HI> Had there been room for them, he had sent all the rest <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="appendix page"/> to the same place, but for want of conveniency, <MILESTONE N="28" UNIT="appendix page"/> he sent most part of them to be secured in the houses of the best Gentlemen of that Country. If 500 <HI>l.</HI>'s worth of the goods were saved, its 500 times more then was expected or hop'd for by the
<PB N="69" REF="38"/> People belonging to her and in all appearance the Ship, Cargo and mony, was worth some thou∣sands of pounds; but observe, it <HI>[was]</HI> and then he [<HI>believes,</HI> &amp;c.] all which might indisputably have been saved had not the Examinat and the rest car∣ry'd the mony ashore, with some sinister design, and had not the Master caused the holes to be bor'd <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="appendix page"/> to destroy the Cargo, and turned the Ship adrift, <MILESTONE N="17" UNIT="appendix page"/> that she might beat, and be torn to pieces, by <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> the Rabble and their own men. <MILESTONE N="19" UNIT="appendix page"/> </P>
<P N="16"><HI>XVI. And this Aexaminat saith that the said <HI>Orpen</HI> and <HI>Crump</HI> took the very Sails, Riggins, and Furniture that were left of the said Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p, and conveyed them away among the rest of the goods.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> How now, Mr. Examinat! you want the main property of the <HI>fourbe</HI> or <HI>fripon.</HI> Wit, a good memory: Has the tediousness of your bladder∣blown Examination made you forget in the Rear what you have said in the Van therof, it's not above half an hours reading since you have plainly said in Page 56. that she had lost all her sayls; Had the Saylers, Master, and Examinat, been as sound at heart as the Sayles, all had been well, and the adventerous Owners might have received a Suc∣cessful return. Now Mr. Examinate, you must call aloud to your high Sh. Captain, and Mr. <HI>Bl.</HI> and try if t'other bagg of Sugar a piece, to each of them can help you? Nay can any pecuniary mulct wipe this Blot out of your Escutchcon, if you have any coat of Arms? What <HI>Hocus-Pocus</HI> tricks are here? <HI>'Tis</HI> and <HI>'tis not.</HI> The Master in his Letter
<PB N="70" REF="39"/>
<MILESTONE N="31" UNIT="appendix page"/> of the 28th of <HI>January</HI> to Mr. <HI>Palmer,</HI> and you in the forlorn part of your Examination, agree, that she had not a sail left, yet towards the fagg∣end of the same Examination, <HI>Orpen and Crump took away the very sayls, &amp;c.</HI> But least the curious Reader might be at a loss to know which is which, <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"/> or where to believe you; 'tis most obvious to the <MILESTONE N="13" UNIT="appendix page"/> World, that she had a very good suit of sayles <MILESTONE N="25" UNIT="appendix page"/> when the Master forsook her, and had not the unlawful lucre of the 2500 l. withdrawn the hearts of the Saylors, the Sayls might have carryed the Ship far enough from <HI>Orpen</HI> and <HI>Crump.</HI></P>
<P N="27"><HI>XVII. That this Examinat, Passengers, and Ships Crew, being strangers in the Country, the said <HI>Orpen</HI> and <HI>Crump</HI> gave out ridiculous reports about them, purposely to frighten them, and make them odious to the Country, the said <HI>Orpen</HI> confest to this <HI>Examinat;</HI> and afterwards advised him to run away and leave Ship and all behind them, telling them that if they would stay, he believed they would be all knockt in the Head.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Though they were strangers in the Country, 'twas the Mate and Carpenter that gave out ridiculous reports of them, and discove∣red the whole intrigue of destroying the Ship; 'twas their own Consciences, whose ghastly Spe∣ctrums they could not be rid of, and not <HI>Orpen</HI> and <HI>Crump,</HI> that advised them to flee from the place where they had committed so vile a fact; but few abiding upon that ground where themselves have been Guilty of Blood-shedding, or other foul crimes.</P>
<P N="18"><PB N="71" REF="39" MS="y"/><HI>XVIII. That within 12 days after the said <HI>Orpen</HI> and <HI>Crump</HI> had taken possession of the said Ship, Mr. <HI>Charles Monke</HI> the Kings Collector for that County, Mr. <HI>Edward Herbert</HI> the high Sh. Mr. <HI>Gibbings</HI> the Surveyor, and Capt. <HI>Gregory</HI> Governour of <HI>Rosse-Castle,</HI> came with several Soldiers to take the Examinate and the rest belonging to the Ship prisoners, the said <HI>Orpen</HI> having informed them by Letters that they were Pyrates, or little better.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The Examinate has not yet found his Journal, for 'twas within Seven dayes after the possesion, that Mr. <HI>Monk,</HI> Mr. <HI>Herbert,</HI> Capt. <HI>Gregory</HI> and Mr, <HI>Gibbings,</HI> came into that Coun∣try; and the Soldiers came to guard them, and not to take the Examinate and company Prison∣ers; Neither were there any such Letters as the Examinate Speaks of. But there wanted not grounds enough to have them taken up; The Carpenter having upon Oath, before the Capt. and high Sh, discovered the whole plot that de∣stroyed the Ship. and Cargo; But they had more <HI>Grace</HI> then to take them up, having a far greater appetite to take up some Wallets of Indigo and Sugar.</P>
<P N="19"><HI>XIX. But the said Collector understanding by their Clearings of the Office and Government of <HI>Jamaica,</HI> which the Captain produced, that they were wronged, gave no Credit to the said <HI>Orpen</HI> and <HI>Crump,</HI> but was highly in∣censed against them, and told them that he would ac∣quaint the Government of their villanys, whereupon the said <HI>Orpen</HI> delivered up the Ship to the said Captain, But stopt the goods that were visible in his posession, alleaging that he ought to have the half Salvage, and quitted the seizure.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The Collector never understood by their
<PB N="72" REF="40"/> Clearings that they were honest men; for they <MILESTONE N="46" UNIT="appendix page"/> produced but very imperfect Bills of loading, particularly there was for the Indigo no other In∣voyce but thirteen barrells, whereas Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> made it appear to their faces that there was a great deal more, and other sort of Casks, as Pun∣chions <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> and Hogsheads of Indigo and other Goods, <MILESTONE N="33" UNIT="appendix page"/> which were havockt away by the Examinant and by the rest of the Ships Company, But this <HI>Lyell</HI> was never Shipt as Master; but the Master dying (as they alleage) after they left <HI>Ja∣maica,</HI> Mr. <HI>Lyell</HI> (as he pretends) was desired to take upon him the charge of the Ship; and thus <MILESTONE N="46" UNIT="appendix page"/> he became Master, yet all this while the former Masters pocket-book, or any other thing to shew their honesty from <HI>Jaimaca,</HI> or a true Invoyce from thence was never produced, so that whether any part of the Cargo was transhipt into any o∣ther Ship at Sea, is yet doubtful. And though they appeared as very honest men to the high Sh. Capt. <HI>Greg,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bl.</HI> It was not so until some hand∣som oblations of Sugar, Indigo and Cotton, were first made. But as for delivering up the Ship, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Master would not be perswaded upon any terms to look after her, &amp; had not Mr. <HI>Monk</HI> cry'd <MILESTONE N="45" UNIT="appendix page"/> shame at him, he had not gone to her any more; and though by much ado he was now in a man∣ner <MILESTONE N="46" UNIT="appendix page"/> forced to go on board, Yet he left her the same day, and came not to her in five dayes after, nor then, until he was Soundly raild at again by Mr. <HI>Monk</HI> for his Negl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gence; and tho' he remained
<PB N="73" REF="40"/> in the Country for three weeks afterwards; so careful he was, that he went away and left the Fustick lying among the water and Ballast.</P>
<P N="20"><HI>XX. The said Examinat further saith, that the said <HI>Orpen</HI> produced a Letter to him, which he said he recei∣ved from <HI>Thomas Farren</HI> Esq; Judge of the Admiralty as <HI>Cork,</HI> and the said Captain <HI>Waller,</HI> ordering him to seiz the said Ship and Cargo aforesaid.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> There was no Letter from Mr. <HI>Farren;</HI> and Capt. <HI>Wallers</HI> Letter was dated the 25th of <HI>February</HI> being 12 dayes after the Examinate left that Country, in which Letter, are these words <HI>[Be carefull of every thing belonging to the Ship Laurell, for since the men are saved, the Ship and Goods are still the Owners, for which you are to have Salvage]</HI> but the distorted opticks of the Examinant have extorted words of other shapes and hews, from a Letter which he never saw.</P>
<P N="21"><HI>XXI. And further saith that the said <HI>Orpen</HI> did con∣fess to this Examinat, that he gave out many false and Scandalous reports upon the said Captain and company, but it was in passion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This is such another confession as <HI>O <MILESTONE N="15" UNIT="appendix page"/> Sulivan More</HI>'s, where the Examinat sayes that he confess'd that he found all things in good Order on board the Ship, who never was on board her.</P>
<P N="22"><HI>XXII. And this Examinat further saith, that the said Captain <HI>Gregory,</HI> the Surveyor and the high Sh. of the County of <HI>Kerry</HI> told him that the said <HI>Orpen</HI> did offer to bribe them purposely to set them against the Ships company, but they refused to do the same, and this Examinat saith that he hath bribed several on that account, as this Examimat has been enformed.</HI></P>
<PB N="74" REF="41"/>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Notwithstanding that it's believed that the Sh. and Captain <HI>Gregory</HI> would say any thing for their votaries, its a question whether the above Paragraph be not the Examinats own, tho' after the Country had laboured greatly under the fre∣quent extortions of the Captain and his Soldiers; And the Sh. sometimes granting his Replevin to these Soldiers against the new English, with no other design then to possess himself of their Goods, and then Superseading his own Replevin when be found that the Soldiers would not bring the goods to himself; The whole Country being in a tumult through these oppressons, which asto∣nisht the English to find the Laws administred in this manner, where they expected such upright∣ness as might be leading to all the rest of the <MILESTONE N="11" UNIT="appendix page"/> Country; The Sh. profering 23 Guineas and 2 C. weight of Sugar, to get the Masters Note for Sal∣vage <MILESTONE N="33" UNIT="appendix page"/> out of Mr. <HI>Orpen's</HI> hands, His sending to Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> that if he would give him Twenty Guinea's, he would compose all matters to his content with the Master, and alwayes fide∣ing with one or another, and setting the people of the Country &amp; the people of the Ship at variance; It's very manifest that tho' there was no Bribery, there wanted not Inducements of the first Rate.</P>
<P N="23"><HI>XXIII. And this Examinate further faith that the said <HI>Orpen</HI> wrote to one Captain <HI>Cuningham</HI> then Governour of <HI>Ross,</HI> as he was enformed, to let one <HI>Cnoher Boy O Suli∣van,</HI> who was then one of the chief of the Toryes, then in custody, to make his escape; who accordingly made his escape and was the head of the Toryes as this Examinat
<PB N="75" REF="41"/> was enformed that burnt the house and Robb'd the Exami∣nat and company of their Money aforesaid.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Though this paragraph is already ans∣wered, page 27. yet it's not amiss to ask the question, How came <HI>Cnoher Boy</HI> to escape at Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI>'s instance, when Capt. <HI>Cuningham</HI>'s own <MILESTONE N="39" UNIT="appendix page"/> Letter denyes any such thing, and was vext at the escape? If he was a Tory, how did the Capt. dare <MILESTONE N="38" UNIT="appendix page"/> let him go? If he was not, it's not a farthing mat∣ter at whose instance he escap'd: If he escap'd at <HI>Orpen's</HI> instance, how came it that he carryed his <MILESTONE N="38" UNIT="appendix page"/> Irons away with him? as also the Centinells Mus∣quet? If he escaped at <HI>Orpen's</HI> instance, why was he pursued immediately by the Soldiers? If he <MILESTONE N="37" UNIT="appendix page"/> was a Tory, why did not he sorthwith after his escape, Joyn the Toryes that were then out up∣on their keeping? But it being discovered that he was a Spie upon them, they sought his life on the one side, and on the other side, he was in∣cessantly <MILESTONE N="38" UNIT="appendix page"/> pursued by the Soldiers, and at lenth for∣ced, <HI>se defendendo,</HI> to set up a company for him∣self, and became the worst of Toryes. But has Capt. <HI>Gregory</HI> commited one Tory to Goal dure∣ing the whole time of his Governing in that Country? Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> has, by the discoveryes of <HI>Cnoher Boy,</HI> brought into Goal great numbers <MILESTONE N="34" UNIT="appendix page"/> of notorious Murderers and Robbers; and for fear he should by the same means, bring in the Rest in the same manner, and so spoil the Soldiers Trade of free Quartering, <HI>Cnoher Boy</HI> was forced <MILESTONE N="33" UNIT="appendix page"/> to become Tory, and <HI>Orpen</HI> (who was the great∣est <MILESTONE N="34" UNIT="appendix page"/>
<PB N="76" REF="42"/> Prosecutor of Malefactors) must now be accused as a friend to such. In the mean time, while these Loyalists are telling a story of <HI>Cnoher Boy;</HI> they have sufferd great part of that Provence to be over Run with Toryes; and these Soldiers (be∣ing a sort somewhat tamer) do imitate their foot∣stepps, and under pretence of beating for them, (whether for want of Pay, or to oblidge their Capt.) have Robbd the Country almost of what the Toryes lest; And the Commissioners of the Revenue will find but a very sorry return from thence for many years to come, by reason that great numbers of Families have fled from the crueltyes of the lawless Robbers, and as little Lawfull Government of this Captains Soldiers, the latter having plundred at the heels of the former, those parts are in a manner laid waste.</P>
<P>But this being a Discourse which hath a vo∣lume of its own; Its high time to return again to the Examinat, who has made such a horrible Nar∣rative in his topsy-turvy Examination of things, that <HI>were</HI> and <HI>were not,</HI> in a sort of Legerdemaine and sometimes a <HI>Hysteron Proteron</HI> Scene, where there was no manner of <HI>Horse</HI> at all to be found, nor a <HI>Cart</HI> to set <HI>afore him;</HI> yet from the 30th of <HI>January</HI> to the 7th of <HI>March</HI> (being the day whereon his abominable Examination came into the World,) was a considerable time to frame his Heteroclitical Modell of the whole procee∣dings upon the Ship <HI>Laurel,</HI> who left her the <MILESTONE N="26" UNIT="appendix page"/> 29th of <HI>January,</HI> and was never any nearer to
<PB N="77" REF="42"/> her afterwards, then 3 long miles distance; <HI>Quae∣cunque <MILESTONE N="26" UNIT="appendix page"/> novato ritu deficiunt superantve Heterocli∣ta sunto,</HI> and after this his Pike-and-dagger-account, (some too long, as some too short for any recon∣cilable medium of Truth) the religious man will judge, that the Jew had but little regard to either Testament, when he fired off this Examination at random with both eyes winkt at once; The tonitruous bellowing whereof, has not onely frigh∣ted away many innocent people from their Hou∣ses, but has also smitten the minds of the Nations with a wrathfull concussion of concern'd displea∣sure against them; and at length it prov'd
<Q><L>A Puddle-Fight, or Battle of Squirt;</L>
<L>Ne'er a Man kill'd, and no Body hurt.</L></Q> Save that it graz'd upon Mr. <HI>Orpen,</HI> and so stunn'd him into 5 weeks confinement in <HI>Kerry;</HI> and from thence tumbled him most Unbailably head∣long for 7 score miles together, in custody, closely begirted with some of the treasonable Chain-Shots; But in open Court, <HI>He brake those Withs as a thred of tow when it toucheth the fire.</HI></P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>Myars</HI> went not to <HI>Dublin</HI> upon that affair, without the advice of the high Sh. who having by his letter of the 13th of <HI>February</HI> given the Government a partiall account of the proceedings upon the Ship, did not omitt to in∣struct the Examinat in such particulars as were re∣quisite to justifie that Letter.</P>

That she drove to and fro before their <MILESTONE N="2" UNIT="appendix page"/> faces all that day, with her sayles lower'd a hull, <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"/> no anchor dropt; and all means for preservation <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="appendix page"/> despised; at length the Kedg-anchor was
<PB N="79" REF="43"/> dropt by a stranger, and she fleeted day and night. 3, 12, 29, 14.</P>
<P N="8">8. That the Master denyed that he had any <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> stock for his sheet Anchor, whereas the stock was then on board.</P>
<P N="9">9. His refusing to have a stock made in an <MILESTONE N="24" UNIT="appendix page"/> hours time.</P>
<P N="10">10. That the Examinate positively saith that O <MILESTONE N="15" UNIT="appendix page"/> <HI>Sulivan More,</HI> Mr. <HI>Clark,</HI> Mr. <HI>Aldwel</HI> and Capt. <MILESTONE N="23" UNIT="appendix page"/> <HI>Carthy</HI> were turned out of the Ship; Whereas O <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="appendix page"/> <HI>Sulivan More</HI> never came near her, Mr. <HI>Clark</HI> <MILESTONE N="16" UNIT="appendix page"/> came not in 10 days, Mr. <HI>Aldwel</HI> &amp; Capt. <HI>Carthy</HI> <MILESTONE N="26" UNIT="appendix page"/> (who came not until next morning) were em∣ploy'd <MILESTONE N="32" UNIT="appendix page"/> by Mr. <HI>Orpen,</HI> to whom all do attribute the right of Salvage.</P>
<P N="11">11. That the whole Cargo (especially the Su∣gars) <MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="appendix page"/> was in a manner damnified, before Mr. <HI>Or∣pen</HI> <MILESTONE N="10" UNIT="appendix page"/> went on board, by means of the holes which <MILESTONE N="20" UNIT="appendix page"/> the Master made in the Ship.</P>
<P N="12">12. That the Master (when he forsook the <MILESTONE N="4" UNIT="appendix page"/> Ship for good and all) desired only 2 Casks of <MILESTONE N="25" UNIT="appendix page"/> Indigo to bear his charges out of the Country, and <MILESTONE N="29" UNIT="appendix page"/> bid every body take the Rest, a hopeful invita∣tion to the Country to come in and tear her all to pieces.</P>
<P N="13">13. That by <HI>Peter Row</HI>'s Examination before Barron <HI>Ecclin,</HI> and by all other Examinations hitherto, it never appeared that he had any Sugar at all in that Ship; yet <HI>Orpen</HI> was found guilty for two hogsheads which Mr. <HI>Row</HI> had not in the Ship, and not guilty for the Lyme-juice which was in the Ship.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="80" REF="44"/>14. That the Master at the Tryal of the indictment, answered upon Oath, that he could not Accept of the assistance of the boats to bring <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="appendix page"/> away his Ship, because 'twas a most dismal stor∣my night. and so dark, that he could not see his hand; whereas it was proved in open Court to be full moon, and a glorious calme night.</P>
<P N="15"> <MILESTONE N="30" UNIT="appendix page"/> 15. That the Master declar'd that she was ve∣ry, <MILESTONE N="12" UNIT="appendix page"/> leaky and in regard that the water stunk, he <MILESTONE N="42" UNIT="appendix page"/> alleg'd that the Sugar made it stink.</P>
<P N="16">16. That there's one thing more observable in Mr. <HI>Orpen's</HI> Justification, <HI>Viz</HI> that there were but eight hogsheads of Lyme juice on board, and so many he saved without imbezlement, and might have done the like with the Sugars and all the <MILESTONE N="17" UNIT="appendix page"/> rest, had not the Master bored the holes and slipt <MILESTONE N="19" UNIT="appendix page"/> the warp, and turn'd her loose to the Mob and her own men.</P>
<P N="17"> <MILESTONE N="62" UNIT="appendix page"/> 17.

<P N="18"> <MILESTONE N="40" UNIT="appendix page"/> 18. That Cap. <HI>Greg.'s</HI> men sold the Ships Goods,
<PB N="81" REF="44"/> and he imprisoned the Buyers till they compound∣ed with him for 6 Guineas Bribe, and then set them at Liberty, yet sent his Brotherinlaw and o∣ther Soldiers to take away the Goods.</P>
<P N="19">19. That it's admirable, that neither the Ex∣aminate nor the Master, hath in all this progress, given an acompt that they fired some great num∣ber of Guns for Pylots, Since they fired none at all during the whole time of their pretended distress.</P>
<P N="20">20. That by their own confession upon Oath, <MILESTONE N="42" UNIT="appendix page"/> she came ashore after 7 a Clock in the morning, <MILESTONE N="1" UNIT="appendix page"/> and suppose that there were no wittnesses to prove <MILESTONE N="3" UNIT="appendix page"/> that she fleeted afterwards, as there are, the <MILESTONE N="6" UNIT="appendix page"/> whole Country, that she did all that day to and <MILESTONE N="12" UNIT="appendix page"/> fro' with Flood and Ebb; Lay it before all the <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> Mariners in the world; If a W.<HI>S.</HI>W.

But to clear that point she Remains (in <HI>Killmare</HI>) Tight to this day, save the holes that the Master caused to be made in her, which was not till three dayes after she struck.</P>
<P N="21">21. That the Master, Passengers and Ships Company have no way to save themselves, but by laying their horrid Crimes upon others; and what will not such Principles alleage, say and Swear?
<PB N="82" REF="45" MS="y"/> And what will they not give for wittnesses, rather <MILESTONE N="11" UNIT="appendix page"/> then ly in Goal for such a Cargo, and so much mo∣ny? Look back to 43 and 44.</P>
<P N="22">22. That the high Sh. Capt. <HI>Greg.</HI> and Mr <HI>Bl.</HI> have been more then ordinary mercenary in the whole proceedings, <HI>Et dabit Deus his quoque finem.</HI></P>
<P N="23">23. Why is Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> prosecuted, who saved <MILESTONE N="45" UNIT="appendix page"/> all that was to be saved, and gave a fair account, and may be most serviceable to the Owners?

<P N="24">24. How easyly all the mony might have been <MILESTONE N="43" UNIT="appendix page"/> saved, and Mr. <HI>Palmer's</HI> ruine prevented, had they but told him in time, that the Treasure was in his house, which he was never made to under∣stand till after all vvas lost.</P>
<P N="25"> <MILESTONE N="8" UNIT="appendix page"/> 25.

Dunigan</HI> 20 <HI>l.</HI> for a <MILESTONE N="11" UNIT="appendix page"/> false Oath. Look back to 43, The apprehending of Mr. <HI>Orpen's</HI> vvitnesses for Felony upon no other <MILESTONE N="32" UNIT="appendix page"/> account then to frighten them from giving their <MILESTONE N="33" UNIT="appendix page"/> testimony <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Sh. and the Master offering 23 Guinnyes and 2 hundred weight of Sugar to get the Master<HI>'s</HI> <MILESTONE N="11" UNIT="appendix page"/> note for Salvage out of Mr. <HI>Orpens</HI> hands &amp;c.</P>

<P N="26">26. That all the Ships crew (except two) <MILESTONE N="8" UNIT="appendix page"/> kept ashore with the Chests, and never regarded the Ship any more, and by chance saved their <MILESTONE N="7" UNIT="appendix page"/> shares of the Treasure, having carry'd away their proportions before the house was set on fire, and <MILESTONE N="13" UNIT="appendix page"/> left the Master, the Carpenter and Gunner to, <MILESTONE N="25" UNIT="appendix page"/> manage the destruction of the Ship and Cargo, to colour their slipping away with the Treasure. <MILESTONE N="9" UNIT="appendix page"/> </P>
<P N="27">27. That Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> had full power to ma∣nage <MILESTONE N="23" UNIT="appendix page"/> the Ship and Goods, and brought her safe <MILESTONE N="4" UNIT="appendix page"/> into a Creek to the Masters shame, though she had <MILESTONE N="5" UNIT="appendix page"/> much water in her vvhen he forsook her.</P>
<P N="28">28 That the Note vvhich the Master passed <MILESTONE N="9" UNIT="appendix page"/> for Salvage, vvas for Mr. <HI>Orpens</HI> use and behoof, <MILESTONE N="32" UNIT="appendix page"/> and for no other end vvhatever. <MILESTONE N="16" UNIT="appendix page"/> </P>
<P N="29">29 Why did the Master profer 23 Guinnyes and 2 hundred vveight of Sugar as a bribe to get <MILESTONE N="11" UNIT="appendix page"/> that Note back out of Mr. <HI>Orpens</HI> hands?</P>
<P N="30">30 The abstruseness of the Examinats Ex∣cuse, for the Master's forsaking the Ship, <HI>[To see what was become of the Passengers]</HI> leaving a <MILESTONE N="22" UNIT="appendix page"/> rich Cargo in a fine Ship of 10 foot in the hold, <MILESTONE N="19" UNIT="appendix page"/> with three Augur-holes, in 15 foot Water, with∣out <MILESTONE N="17" UNIT="appendix page"/> Warp or Cable, to a merciless Mob, headed <MILESTONE N="23" UNIT="appendix page"/> by her own Men. <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"/> </P>
<P N="32">32. That they had premeditately resolved to <MILESTONE N="19" UNIT="appendix page"/> cast her away, but could not, without some Ar∣tificial <MILESTONE N="8" UNIT="appendix page"/>
<PB N="84" REF="46"/>
<MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> Prejudice first done unto her.</P>
<P N="32"> <MILESTONE N="23" UNIT="appendix page"/> 32. That her own Men were the first that <MILESTONE N="18" UNIT="appendix page"/> broke open the Hatches, and made havock of the <MILESTONE N="21" UNIT="appendix page"/> best of the Goods.</P>
<P N="33">33. And you may remember that it hath been an ancient custom when Ships have been willfully cast away in this manner, to have the Owners or Merchants embroil'd into Law Suits by the Mast∣er, and to have the Country (though never so in∣ocent where such wickedness hath been commit∣ed,) made a Sacrifice to the Loosers, for a warn∣ing to future ages that all others might hereafter flee from a Ship in distress, and shall not dare presume to save her, for fear that the Master had premiditatly resolved to throw her away; As the la∣mentable consequence which happened soon after∣wards to the <HI>Joseph</HI> of <HI>Bristol</HI> burthen 260 Tuns, from <HI>Mevis</HI> with a rich Cargo, being forced into a real distress near <HI>Killmare,</HI> nothing was more posible then to have saved her with a very little assistance; But the Country who were freshened with the late fate of <HI>Killmare</HI>-people; That are impeach'd as a pack of Traytors for performing a work of Christianity; made fast their doors, and with their vvhole familyes wives and Children, fled from their houses as from an epidemical plague, and Returned not again till she and her Cargo were utterly lost for want of help. And must the nations suffer shipwrack thus for the <HI>Laurells</HI> sake? The Mob indeed might basten in to rend out <HI>Gods penny</HI> (so called) But People of repute who could

<P N="33">33.

<Q><L>Think not by doing well, a Fame to get;</L>
<L>But be a Villain, and thou shalt be great.</L></Q> And hovv necessary the consequences of such im∣peachments can be to the good of the Kingdom, the Government vvill undoubtedly Judge.</P>
<P>And when the most Just GOD, that seeth in∣to the bottom of all hearts, shall in his due time think fit that these and such-like Gentlemen (who have disturbed the greatest part of Their Majesties Dominions, with their false and scanda∣lous Insinuations; and the better to pass in M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣querade with their horrible Machinations, have laboured to fix their vile clandestine Facts upon the Innocent) should be called to a Court of Ju∣stice, to receive their condign Punishments from

<P><HI>I</HI> Heartily condole your bad fortune in that Country where I am concern'd: But yet since it was a design'd Wickedness, it's all one to you upon what ground it happen'd: Tho' it is not so to me, that have suffer'd so much by it in my Reputation.</P>
<P>Now whether the Jew, the Master, the high Sh.

<P>Who were the chief Projectors to ruine a rich ship, thereby to gain an opportunity to carry off the Trea∣sure behind the Curtain? Mr. <HI>Lyell</HI> may tell you that it was Mr. <HI>Myars</HI> and himself.</P>

<P>Who brought the Ship (of ten foot in the hold, with their <HI>3</HI> politicall <HI>Augur-holes</HI> in her bottom, in <HI>15</HI> foot water) into a safe Creek? I take that upon my self, as done by my people. But,</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="affidavit">
<P><HI>TImothy Turtane</HI> of <HI>Toasista</HI> in the County of <HI>Kerry,</HI> Mariner, came before me this day, and made Oath, That on the Twenty-Eighth day of <HI>January</HI> last, the Ship <HI>Laurel</HI> of <HI>Lon∣don</HI> came up the River of <HI>Kilmare</HI> with her Fore-sail and Main-sail loose in disorder, without any person on board her, and saith that about seven in the Morning she drove up to <HI>Cappanacossy</HI> upon the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rand; and about the same time the Master came to <HI>Cappanacossy</HI> with several Bags of Money, carried by his Ships Company, and went all together into the House of <HI>Dermot Mac Owen,</HI> about a quarter of a mile off the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hip; and saith that the Master remained there about eight hours, without seeming to take any notice of the Ship, which drove to and fro in his sight, as the Tyde ebb'd and flow'd; but saith, that the Master sent for a quarter Cask of Rum, and about one hundred pounds of Sugar, wherewith the Master and his Com∣pany, together with some of the Countrey People, made themselves merry ashore, while the Ship was dri∣ving up and down with the Flood and Ebb before their Faces; and saith, that towards the evening the Master <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent on Board, as did likewise this Deponent, and the
<PB N="2" REF="49"/> Ship was still driving to and fro, without any Anchor dropt; whereupon this Deponent ask'd the Master to put out an Anchor; the Master answer'd, That his Cable was not in order; this Deponent told him that he this Deponent would put out the Kedge-Anchor that had a small Warp to it; the Master told him he might let it alone; however this Deponent by the Masters consent at length dropt that Anchor; and saith that the Ma∣ster never caused any other Anchor to be put out, but that the Ship rid out wholly by that small Warp until the Master deserted her, which was the third day after, notwithstanding that there were then on board the Sheet Anchor, and small Bower, with Cables suitable; and saith that he called to the Master, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old him that his Ship was Tight, and that the worst Weather made but very little Seas in that place, and that she was in no manner of danger; and told the Master that if he would permit him, that he and his Boat-men wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d save the Ship, and get her off immediately. The Master then bid this Deponent hold his Tongue, and that he would be this Deponents Friend. The Deponent finding that the Master was then resolved to cast her away, came no more near him, but told every Body he met with, that he was so resolved; and saith that the Ma∣ster did accordingly leave her most shamefully at a time when a Man could wade to her side, as there did five men, who having no Boat, waded to her side, and went on Board, presently after the Master and all the Men quitted her; And saith, that two Days before the Ship was so deserted by the Master and Men aforesaid, the Master caused the Men to open the Hatches, and take out several Goods, and made havock thereof to the Countrey People. And saith, that one <HI>Ned Dunegon</HI> did also profes to save the Ship the first day she came to <HI>Cappanacossy,</HI> and the Master would not abide to hear of it; but <HI>Dunegon</HI> being incessant upon the matter, the Master got him well drubb'd, and turn'd ashore. And
<PB N="3" REF="49"/> saith, that the Mate of a Canary Ship was likewise on Board, when this Deponent discours'd the Master to have his Ship saved; and this Mate likewise told the Master that he the Mate would get her off presently; the Master told the Mate that he should meddle with what concern'd him. And this Deponent verily believes that the Master and some of the Passengers had a Design to carry away the money which was in the Ship, and to cast her away, that it might be pretended that the mo∣ney and all was lost together; and saith that most of that Country believes the same. And saith if the ma∣ster had not caused holes to be bor'd in the bread∣room through the bottom of the ship, he could not well have cast her away in such a place where she lay with∣out some artificial prejudice done first unto her. And saith that but very little of the sugar remain'd undamnified being in a manner all spoil'd by the water which came into the said Ship by means of the holes which were made through the bottom before the master deserted her.</P>

<P><HI>CHarles Mansfield</HI> of <HI>Killowen</HI> in the County of <HI>Kerry,</HI> Gent. came before me, and made Oath, That he went on Board the Ship <HI>Laurel, Christo∣pher Lyel</HI> Commander, as she was in Distress on the 29th day of <HI>January</HI> last, in the River of <HI>Kilmare,</HI> and saith that she then rid only by a small Warp, and the ground whereon she lay was sandy and gravelly, and the Ship was in no great danger, for that the place where she lay was good ground and the greatest winds made but very little Seas; And saith, that that day the Ship fleet∣ed, and this Deponent saith, that he told the Master that she fleeted, and that he this Deponent with several Eng∣lish men, would bring her off forthwith; but the said
<PB N="4" REF="50"/> Mr. <HI>Lyel</HI> would not by any means consent thereunto. And further saith, That the Night following was a very fair Moon-shine Night, and this Deponent told the Ma∣ster, that they would stay on Board with him, and get off his Ship, whereupon the Master turn'd this Depo∣nent and the rest out of the Ship; and saith that next day, being the 30th of <HI>January</HI> aforesaid, about Noon, the Master called to all the People on Board, and bid them save what they could, and carry away in their Boats every man for himself; whereupon Nine Barrels of Indigo were put into two Boats, and the Master then desired this Deponent to save Two Barrels, to bear his Charges out of the Countrey, and all the rest for them∣selves; and presently the Master and all the People then on Board went off, and deserted the <HI>Ship;</HI> and saith, that as soon as they came ashore, the Master mett with Mr. <HI>Richard Orpen</HI> and told him he left the Ship in a bad condition and desired Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> to get all the hands he could to go on board to Save her, and desired him the said <HI>Orpen</HI> again to make haste on board with all the hands he could; whereupon the said Orpen sent Se∣veral men on board the Ship, and next morning Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> went himself on board. And faith, that when Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> went on board, that several of the Rabble and Rapparees were Crouded into the Ship, and that Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> commanded his own men to their arms, and ex∣pell'd the Rabble and Rapparees, and proceeded forthwith to discharge the Cargo, and this Deponent saith, that the Master when he deserted the Ship, declared that there was five foot of water in her, And that all the goods would be lost the next Tyde; And saith, that the ma∣ster while this deponent was on board, did always re∣nounce and deny all help whatever to Save the Ship, and often times wisht that she would Split. And saith, that when others would have Saved her, and often of∣fer'd to Save her, that the master told them they should hold their Tongues and he would be their friend;

<P><HI>BRyen Kelly</HI> of <HI>Gurtamullen,</HI> in the County of <HI>Kerry,</HI> Gent came before me this day and made Oath, That on the 28th of <HI>January</HI> last, the Ship <HI>Laurel</HI> of <HI>London, Christopher Lyell</HI> Master, drove up the River of <HI>Killmare</HI> close along before the Black-Water, which being a very good Harbour, the Master, some Passengers and the Ships Company came ashore there in their Long-Boat, and brought great quantities of Gold and Silver with them in Bags, and as soon they came ashore they sunk the Boat; and this Deponent verily believes, that some contrivance was used in the Rudder to cause the Ship to stand up the River, otherwise, that she had in all likelihood put into that Harbour right afore the Wind, which was then at <HI>S.</HI> W. and the said Harbour lying N. E. out of the River, and saith, that the Ship drove up about two Miles from <HI>Black-Water</HI> to <HI>Cappanacossy,</HI> upon a fine easie Strand about seven a Clock in the Morning; and in the mean time the Master, Passen∣gers and Ships Company walkt up by land to <HI>Dermot Mac Owens</HI> House at <HI>Cappanacossy</HI> almost as soon as the Ship, where they beh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld the Ship driving to and fro with the Flood and Ebb from Morning till Night, without any Soul on Board her, save that some of the Seamen and one <HI>John Kelly</HI> went on board her, to
<PB N="7" REF="51"/> fetch out some good Liquor, as also the Masters best Cloaths and Sword, wherewith they return'd on shore again, without dropping an Anchor, or taking any other care of the Ship; and with the Master and alto∣gether made themselves merry ashore with Rum and Sugar all that day, while the Ship continued driving to and fro before their Faces, and saith, That the Master, Passengers and Ships Company were often de∣sired to go on board their Ship and take care of her; but still they reply'd, <HI>God Dam her for a Bitch, they would never put foot into her while they breathed;</HI> with many other Expressions to the same effect; and saith, that the Master, Passengers and Company did divide this great store of Gold and Silver among them∣selves, to every one a proportion or share thereof, and particularly the Mate of the Ship drew out a small Handkerchief full of Gold Rings, and distributed the same likewise among them; and saith, That the Ma∣ster Ordered his own share of the Treasure to be put into a Window near himself; saying to the rest of the passengers and company that each had his share given to him, and let every one look to his share; as for him∣self the master, he would not take care of any more than his own share which lay there near him in the Window, And saith that had not Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> come in the evening and put them into Some apprehensions of the Toryes, he verily believes, that they would never have Returned to the Ship again; But after Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> had alarmed them and told them their Ship was the best Garison in the country, and put them in fear of the Toryes, they repair∣ed on board again about the fall of the night with all their money and Gold; And afterwards were more cauti∣ous and carefull thereof; but saith, That that Night was a very fine calm Night, and that several skilful persons, particularly the Mate of a Canary Man told the Master, that he would bring the <HI>Laurel</HI> away forthwith into a safe Harbour without any manner of
<PB N="8" REF="52"/> difficulty; but the Master bid him meddle with what concerned him; and in the like manner he the Master did slight divers other Mariners when they offer'd to save his Ship; and saith, That he this Deponent heard the Master and most of the Ships Company often say, that she ow'd them much Wages, and Swore that she should never owe them any more; that they had divi∣ded the money among them, and would be gone, some to <HI>Cork, Kinsale,</HI> and other places, to be ready to leave the Kingdom by the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rst opportunity; and saith, that when the Master and Company were got on board, that none of them took care to drop an Anchor to stop the <HI>Ship</HI> from driving up and down, until one <HI>Timothy Turtane</HI> dropt a small Anchor that had a small warp to it; and saith, that she rid by no other than that small warp all he time after; and saith, that the Pas∣sengers and most of the Company went up next day in the morning by Boat, and carry'd some Chests along with them to Mr. <HI>Palmers</HI> House, about 3 miles up the River, wherein 'twas believed, that their best Cloaths were; and saith, that the Master, Passengers and Sea∣men were about fifteen in number, and that the Pas∣sengers, Mate and most of the Seamen seemed rather to have a mind to stay about Mr. <HI>Palmers</HI> House to to look to the Ghests, than any-wise to be con∣cerned any more for the Ship and Cargo; but saith, that towards the evening fix of the Seamen went to <HI>Roghty</HI> Bridge, about two miles from Mr. <HI>Palmers</HI> and carried their share of the money thither, and their best Clo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ths, and that Night being the 29th of <HI>January</HI> Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>mer's</HI> House was set on Fire and Robb'd by the Teries, and this Deponent desired the mate and men to go to their Ship again; but the mate told this De∣ponent, that the Master, Seamen, Passengers and all were resolved to destroy the Ship and Cargo, and that there was no concealing thereof any longer; and next morning several of the Seamen went on board again,
<PB N="9" REF="52"/> and gave the master an Account of the Fire and Rob∣bery; whereupon the master and every one on board quit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the Ship, and came ashore at <HI>Killowen</HI> in three Boats, wherein they brought several Barrels of Indigo, and other things belonging to the Ship, where they were met with by <HI>Mr. Richard Orpen,</HI> this Depo∣nent, and several others; as soon as the master stept ashore, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> told <HI>Mr. Orpen</HI> that all the Goods would be lost that Tyde, and that the Ship would inevitably split in pieces out of hand; and desired the said <HI>Orpen</HI> to go with what hands he could make, and save what they could; whereupon Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> did immediately employ some Souldiers, and several of the Country People to repair forthwith to the <HI>Ship</HI> to save what they could; and saith, that Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> employ'd this Deponent also to go along with the rest, but call'd him back again, and bid him go to the Master first, who was gone to an Ale House hard by, and get from the Master a Note under his hand, of what was fit to be given for Salvage, which this Deponent accordingly did, and got <HI>Richard Clerk, Samuel Aldwell, Charles Garthy, Dermot Sulivan</HI> and <HI>Dermot Sulivan</HI> Junior, whom he this Deponent knew to be the Friends and People belonging to Mr. <HI>Orpen,</HI> to be Named along with him this Deponent in the said Note; wherein the Master promised one half for saving the other; and saith, that he this Deponent did procure the said Note upon no other Account, than to the true use and be∣hoof of the said <HI>Orpen;</HI> and saith, that he left <HI>Mr. Orpen</HI> behind, to provide men and boats; and that he this Deponent repaired away towards the Ship that Night, being as soon as he had got the Note Sign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by the Master; and when he cam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> there, he found that the rest of the people employ'd by Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> were got on board, and loosed the Fore-top-sail, and had placed a man at the Helm, whereby they brought the Ship safe into a convenient Greek, though she had
<PB N="10" REF="53"/> beaten somewhat by means of the Masters leaving her loose in a very ill condition, without riding her by any Cable, Warp, or any thing else whatever. After she was brought safe to the Creek, this Deponent went on board and shew'd the Note which he had got from the Master, and told all the people that were on Board, that the business of the Ship and Goods were wholly put into Mr. <HI>Orpens</HI> Hands by the Master, and told them that Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> had desired them to be careful of every thing, and that himself the said <HI>Orpen</HI> would come immediately with men and boats; and saith, that the said <HI>Orpen</HI> came accordingly in the Morning be∣times with men and boats, and fitted up Teachles and and Cannhooks, and fell to work to save the Goods; and saith, that <HI>Charles Carthy, Dermot Sulivan</HI> Jun. and <HI>Samuel Adwell</HI> came also on board about the time at Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> came on board; and saith that Mr. <HI>Or∣pen</HI> did not force, or expel them from the Ship, but commanded some of his own men to their Arms, and thereby expell'd the Rabble which by that time had crouded in abundance into the Ship, and he the said <HI>Orpen</HI> did forthwith employ the said <HI>Aldwell, Carohy, Sulivan,</HI> and this Deponent, to oversee and help put the Goods safe a shore into the most convenient Houses, where the same might be best preserved; and saith, <HI>O Sulivan More,</HI> and <HI>Dermot Sulivan,</HI> Senior, were never on board the Ship at all, and that <HI>Richard Clerk</HI> was not on board her, until ten days after she was Stranded; and saith, that when this Deponent came first on board, that sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had water in her hold, within a foot and half of the Beams of her lower Deck; so that every Cask of Sugar in all, or in part was Dam∣nified; and saith, that the Master came not nigh the Ship, until the third day after she was Stranded; and saith, that the Master, Passengers, and Ships Company never mentioned any thing of their boring the Holes in the Ship, but kept tho same private, until that about
<PB N="11" REF="53"/> ten days after she was Stranded, 'twas spoken of all over the Country, which was discovered by the Mate, after he was gone out of the Country, and then (and not till then) the Master own'd it, and pretended 'twas to prevent the Ships beating.</P>

<P><HI>JOhn Kelly</HI> of <HI>Grenune,</HI> in the County of <HI>Kerry,</HI> Gent. came before me this day and made Oath, That on the 28th of <HI>Jannary</HI> last, about 7 a Clock in the morning the Ship <HI>Laurell</HI> of <HI>London, Christo∣pher Lyell</HI> Master, drove up to <HI>Cappanacossy</HI> in the Ri∣ver of <HI>Killmare,</HI> without any person on Board her upon very good easie ground; and saith, that present∣ly afterwards, the master came up to the House of <HI>Dermot Mac Owen</HI> of <HI>Cappanacossy;</HI> and saith, that
<PB N="12" REF="54"/> the Master and Company brought several bags of mo∣ney with them to that House; and this Deponent dis∣cours'd with the master, and found that the Ship came from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and that the master and compa∣ny had quitted the said Ship at <HI>Black-Water,</HI> about two miles West ward of <HI>Cappanacossy,</HI> and admired that they did not bring the Ship into <HI>Black-Water,</HI> being right before the Wind, which was then at S. W. or thereabouts, and being a very good Harbour; and saith, that the master sent for Rum and Sugar in a∣bundance from on board the Ship; and there with he the Master and Company, with some of the Country People, made merry till towards Evening; and saith, that the Master, Mr. <HI>Myars,</HI> and <HI>Peter Row</HI> (two Pas∣sengers) enquired very earnestly for Horses and Con∣veniencies to carry themselves and their money out of the Country, to Cork <HI>or</HI> Kinsale; whereupon this Deponent and others advised the master rather to betake themselves on board with what money they had; whereto the Master Reply'd, <HI>That she was good for nothing, and a Wrack, and let the Devil take her, as for himself he would never lay his Leg over her side again while he breathed,</HI> and this Deponent saith, that the said <HI>Dermot Mac Owen,</HI> this Deponent and others, told the Master again and again, that she could be no Wrack in that condition; for that by her fleeting up and down with the Tide and Ebb, it appeared, that the was Tight, and in regard that the worst of Winds made no Seas in that place, she was not in danger; and they still desired him the said Master to betake himself and Company to their Ship again; but the more the Master was advised to go and save his Ship, the more he abhorr'd her and re∣nounced her, and continued saying, that if he could but get Conveniencies to carry himself, Company and Passengers, and their money our of the Country, he did not care if the Devil had the Ship and all that
<PB N="13" REF="54"/> belonged to her; but at length by the perswasions of this Deponent and others, the Master writ a Letter to one Mr. <HI>Thomas Palmer</HI> a Justice of the Peace in that Country, wherein he seemed to pretend that his Ship was in distress, and craved Aid, and mentioned in his Letter, that he had not a Sail left; and this Deponent saith, that next day he this Deponent was on board, and saw in the Gun Room 4 or 5 large Sails, which this Deponent believes were New Sails; and this De∣ponent saith, that in the Evening, Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> came to the Master at <HI>Cappanacossy</HI> on the 28th aforesaid; and saith, that Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> discours'd the Master, and finding that he had great quantities of Gold and Silver at <HI>Dermot mac Owen</HI>'s House, Mr. <HI>Palmer</HI> then told the Master that he was in danger of losing his Money, for that the Tories were said to be hard by. Upon which apprehensions of the Tories, the Master with his Com∣pany and Passengers, went on board again that Night, about an hour after Sun set. But this Deponent veri∣ly believes that if the Master had not been afraid of the Tories, that neither the Master, nor any of the Com∣pany or Passengers, had ever returned again to the Ship, for that the Master, Passengers, and Ships Company had divided the Money and Gold amongst themselves, to every one a share, before the Letter was sent to Mr. <HI>Palmer,</HI> and remembers that the Master bid his Boy to carry his, <HI>viz.</HI> the Master's share of the Money, and lay it by in the Window; and added in these words, <HI>That every one had his share of the money divided and given to him, and let every man secure his own share;</HI> And saith, that the mate and men declared that the Ship owed them a years Wages, and swore that she should never owe them any more; that they had divided what Money was in the Ship among them selves, that they would be gone, some to <HI>Cork,</HI> some to <HI>Kinsale, &amp;c.</HI> And this Deponent further saith, That while the Master, and the company, and passengers aforesaid,
<PB N="14" REF="55"/> were at <HI>Dermot Mac Owen's</HI> house; that they made themselves ready to go away out ot the Country with their Mony, having put on several Shirts a piece, and drest themselves up with their best cloaths; And saith, that the Master had also drest himself to be gone; And saith, that he this Deponent was the person that brought the Master his best cloaths, and a fine Sword, out of the Ship by the Masters orders; And saith, that when the division of the Mony and Gold was made, that the Mate drew out a handkerchief that had about fourscore Gold Rings in it and divided the same likewise, among them, and saith that all the said persons belonging to the said Ship, left a great parcell of their worse cloaths upon the Green, and threw the same away near where the Ship was driving to and fro as aforesaid; And saith, that one <HI>Timothy Turtane,</HI> and several others, told the Master before and after the Master went on B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ard, on the 28th at night, that they would save the Ship, and carry her into a safe Harbour forthwith. But the Master still re∣fused, and would not consent to have her brought out of that place; And saith that the Ship was driving to and fro, and after the Master and the rest of the persons be∣longing to her; were all on Board again, no body took any care to drop an Anchor; And faith that <HI>Timothy Tertane</HI> desired the Master to drop an Anchor; the Ma∣ster answered, that he had no Cable in order; <HI>Turtane</HI> told him he would drop a small Anchor which was on board, that had a small Warp to it; the Master told him he might let it alone; but at length the Master con∣senced that it should be dropt; And saith, that she rid by no other than that small Warp, until she was desert∣ed by the Master, which was the third day after she ar∣rived at <HI>Cappanacos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y;</HI> And saith, that before the Ma∣ster deserted the Ship, he often said that she was not worth looking after, and that all her Cargo, except the Indigo, was all damnified and ruined before she came in∣to the River of <HI>Killmare.</HI> And this Deponent further
<PB N="15" REF="55"/> saith, that on the 30th of <HI>January</HI> last, the Master and all the company deserted the Ship; And saith that as soon as he came a shore, he the said Master met with Mr. <HI>Richard Orpen,</HI> and told him that the Ship was left in an ill condition, and that the Goods were all lost by that time, and that the Ship would split presently; and desired Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> to send all the hands he could aboard, to save what he could, and desired the said <HI>Or∣pen</HI> to go and take care of the same; whereupon the said <HI>Orpen</HI> sent several persons on Board, who took care of the Ship, and brought her safe to a Creek; and saith, that <HI>Richard Clerk, Samuel Aldwel, Bryan Kel∣ly, Charles Carthy, Dermot Sulivan,</HI> and <HI>Dermot Suli∣van</HI> Junior, came not nigh the said Ship, until after the other people employ'd by Mr. <HI>Orpen,</HI> had brought her safe to the Creek,</P>

During my being there, I received by 2 Expresses No∣tice of another homeward bound Ship the <HI>Laurel,</HI> also of <HI>London,</HI> stranded within the River of <HI>Kilmare,</HI> which being very unusual, hastned me from the utmost corner over the Mountain to her Relief; but alas, I came too lat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to prevent the mischiefs done her, or to save any considerable part of her Cargo, tho' I have done all that was possible in me to serve the Merchants by preserving what could be found by the strictest searches
<PB N="39 [45]" REF="70" MS="y"/> and Examination; yet it may perhaps be difficul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for me to Escape free from Censure and Calumny, that came not to the place not till eight days after the Rumage, or Scramble, and none hath yet tender'd himself to be examin'd only the Ship Carpenter, whose Examination I here en∣closed send; and if you will accept of the rest upon com∣mon fame, as well touching your friend Mr. <HI>Orpen,</HI> as the Captain and Crew's behavior, It appears to me that the latter, upon what reason, or without they had a mind to forsake the Ship, and consequently to ruin Her and the Cargo, for they caryed their money ashore on the 28 past, and left her to take her chance, when she came ashore presently near the upper end of the River, but fleeted now and then, when they went aboard again, having made several holes in her bottom they forsook her out right, and then Mr. <HI>Orpen</HI> went to save what he could, but too late; who I understand used all means possible to preserve her and the goods. The latter were in a manner destroy'd before he went aboard by the Rable, and water, which was got into her, especially the Sugar. When I came there, I found he had taken much pains and care therein and appeared ready to give me an account of what was saved, and how he had laid the goods with the best safety he could into the most convenient houses for that purpose; and the Master and Passengers promised he should have a reasonable salvage; as for the money which they were Robbed of, 'twas car∣ryed ashore privatly by themselves; So that he had no hand in saving of that; if he had, it had been better for them, for he would undoubtedly have managed with more prudence. But that Reverend worthy man Mr. <HI>Palmer,</HI> is ruined by it; having his house (where the money lay) and all his Substance burnt by the Toryes. Next morning after I came there, I got the Master to go aboard, who I must say, in the condition the Ship was then in, had but little regard of the whole; for he stayed but some few hours on board; so that I had somwhat to do to perswade him to go to her again till about the 12th I did again importune him
<PB N="34 [46]" REF="71" MS="y"/> to look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> after her, the Crew was gone before I came there. He shewed me an imperfect Envoyce but not the former Masters Pocket Book; for you must conceive that this man was not Shipt as Master, but the Master dying at Sea, he appointed this Man to conduct the Ship home. Pray let me hear from you as oft as any thing occurs, and Oblige</P>
