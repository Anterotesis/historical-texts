<P N="2">2. If the <HI>French</HI> shall not Surrender upon the Articles offered them, but shall necessitate our Forces to Expose themselves in the Assault; Then (God succeeding our Arms) besides their Stated Pay, the just half of all Plunder taken from the Enemy, shall be <HI>Shared</HI> among the Officers and Souldiers; Stores of War only Excepted.</P>
<P N="3">3. If it so happen (which God forbid) that any of ours fall in the Attempt, Then what would rightfully have belonged to such persons, if they had lived, shall be made good to their Widows and Children; And if none such be, to those who have the next Legal Right.</P>
