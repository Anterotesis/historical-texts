<P>ON the Sixth of this Month Count <HI>Castelli,</HI> General of Batalia, and Ba∣ron <HI>Smidberg,</HI> having been dispatch'd by Prince <HI>Lowis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> to the Emperour, brought the following Particulars of a great Victory gain'd over the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>That the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army, which he commands in <HI>Servia,</HI> came on the 21st of <HI>August</HI> to <HI>Konighfelt,</HI> notwithstanding the steepness and difficulty of the Mountains, which are interlac'd with Moorasses, so as that they were become impassable by the continual Rains, with which its march had been extreamly incommoded, from the time it had passed the <HI>Morava,</HI> for the going in pursuit of the <HI>Serasquier,</HI> who was retreating towards <HI>Nissa.</HI> That the same day he came in view of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Army, which was drawn up in Battle-array upon Hills. That on the 22d the <HI>Serasquier</HI> retired towards <HI>Jagodina,</HI> behind the River <HI>Morava,</HI> which falls into the <HI>Danube,</HI> where he remain'd Encamp'd till the 26th, for the assembling all his numerous Forces, consisting of Sixty Thousand Men, according to the Report of Spies and Desertets. That the Prince had endeavoured to pass that River, so to attack the <HI>Turks:</HI> But the ill ways having hinder'd the expeditious bringing up of the Boats, and other ne∣cessary Materials for making a Bridge, he had made semblance of retreating, that so by this seint he might draw the <HI>Serasquier</HI> out of the advantagious Posts he possessed, and come to some great Action. After this, on the 29th of the same Month, being St. <HI>John's</HI> Day; which the <HI>Turks</HI> hold to be happy and fortunat to their Arms, that Prince being return'd with the <HI>Imperial</HI> Army to the Neighbourhood of <HI>Potaschin,</HI> or <HI>Baraschin,</HI> caus'd his Army to be Mar∣shall'd in Battel-array, on the Banks of the <HI>Morava.</HI> The Night before, the Bridge-master caus'd two Bridges to be laid over that River, with so much Diligence, that to Reward his Pains and Labours, that Prince had given him a Gratification of a Thousand <HI>Florins.</HI> Ten Thousand <HI>Turks</HI> that had pass'd that River over their own Bridges, with a design to Charge our Reer, were Encounter'd by one of our Detachments that was sent to view them; and after a slight Skirmish, it returned to joyn our Camp, with a <HI>Chiaux</HI> and four <HI>Tartars</HI> they had taken Prisoners, being not strong e∣nough
<PB N="2" REF="2"/> any longer to make head against them with advantage. The 10000 <HI>Turks</HI> seeing our Party retreat, pursued it into the very sight of our Camp, whence great Detachments of Cavalry and Dragoons, were made to drive them back; but while they were engag'd, the Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> caus'd part of his Foot to pass to the other side of the <HI>Morava,</HI> with design to Attack the main Body of the <HI>Turks,</HI> since they express'd so much eagerness to Fight upon a be∣lief, it was out of fear that our Army retired: we had no sooner three Bat∣talions, and five Squadrons on the other side, but that the <HI>Oltomans</HI> came to Charge them most furiously with their <HI>Drawn-Sabres;</HI> but having met our <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">A Term in Fortification, signifying Posts Armed with Spikes.</NOTE> <HI>Chevaux de Frize,</HI> who stop'd their Cavalry, the <HI>Imperialists</HI> kill'd a great number of them in this Action, and they were forc'd to fall back into the <HI>De∣filees,</HI> where they stood our coming up: Then it was, that our Cavalry that had been Detatched against 10000 <HI>Turks,</HI> who would have Charg'd our Reer, repuls'd them, and forc'd them to repass the <HI>Morava</HI> as fast as they could. Our whole Army being pass'd, the <HI>Turks</HI> reinforc'd themselves in the <HI>Defilees,</HI> they possessed before the Plain which they covered, and which had a Wood on one side, and Hills on the other. The Entrance into the Plain, into which the <HI>Defilees</HI> led, was interlac'd with several <HI>Moorasses,</HI> which rendred the Access to it very difficult. The Prince of <HI>Baden</HI> caused the Regiments of <HI>Seraw</HI> and <HI>Kissel,</HI> who were in the Van of the Army, to drive the Enemies from their <HI>De∣filees.</HI> There needed no more than to give our Men to understand that they must pursue the <HI>Ottomans,</HI> and not let the occasion, they had, slip of gain∣ing a great Victory,, to set the Horse and Foot upon passing a-cross those <HI>Moo∣rasles</HI> in the Water up to the Middle, nay up to their very Shoulders, holding up their Arms and Weapons, to hinder them from being wet; and according as they pass'd, they formed themselves into Squadrons and Battalions, until that at length, all being pass'd, and the Battel drawn up in Battel-array, our Troops march'd directly upon the Enemy, who stood our coming up upon a Hill; and they attack'd the Insidels with so much Courage and Fierceness, that they forc'd their Entrenchments, notwithstanding their Opposition; and after having kill'd a vast Number, forc'd them to betake themselves to Flight.</P>
<P>By this Victory we remain'd Masters of the <HI>Turks</HI> Camp, of all their Bag∣gage, Tents, Carriages, Ammunition and Provisions, as also of a hundred and five Pieces of Cannon, of several Mortar-pieces, of a vast number of Colours and Standards, of the Great Horses Tail (which is the <HI>Turks</HI> Great Standard), and abundance of other Riches, insomuch that the Soldiers rejoice in a World of Booty. They Attack'd them with that vigor, that after a Fight of about 4 hours, there were 50000 Routed, 20000 killed, and 6000 taken Prisoners. Count <HI>Castelli</HI> and Baron <HI>Smidbergh,</HI> who brought the first Account, departed from the Camp immediatly after this great Victory, which we hope to be able shortly to give a more individual Account of.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Lowis,</HI> after this happy Success, which cost not the Imperialists 1000 Men, continued his March towards <HI>Nissa,</HI> to destroy the Enemies great Mega∣zines there.</P>
