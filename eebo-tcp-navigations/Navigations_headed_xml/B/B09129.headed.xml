<P>Before the Arrival of Admiral <HI>Evertsen,</HI> it was agreed between the Two Na∣tions, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> should have the Van-guard, which was in all likely∣hood to do them Honour; but at the bottom, to conceal <HI>Torrington</HI>'s Designs, af∣ter they had been under Sail about Two or Three Hours, they were obliged to come to an Anchor, by reason of the Foggs and bad Weather: But soon after they perceived the <HI>French</HI> Fleet to bear up towards them, with the Wind at East-Immediately they weighed Anchor, and endeavoured to gain the Weather-gage, which they did with that success, that <HI>Torrington</HI> gave the Signal for the first Squadron to Engage, but the <HI>French</HI> thought fit to retire. The 6, 7 8, and 9th. the Two Fleets were always in view of one another; but in regard the <HI>French</HI> Fleet was much the stronger, both for Number and biguess of Ships, it was judged most proper not to fight in the open Sea, and <HI>Torrington</HI> did his part so well, that he avoided engaging till he was come to the <HI>Bevesier,</HI> which was fa∣vourable for his Purpose. And there it was that he received the Queen's Orders, not to delay Engaging, if the Wind and Weather would permit, which was the Reason that upon the 10th. by break of day, we went to seek the Enemy, who expected us in order of Battel, and so by nine of the Clock, the Engagement be∣gan between the Blew Squadron of the <HI>French,</HI> and the Van-guard of the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and both sides fired desperately for Three Hours together, till the <HI>French</HI> Squa∣dron not liking their Entertainment, bore away with all the tack they could make; but about one there happened a Calm, which not only prevented the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Pursuit, but put them into a little Disorder; upon which, the <HI>French</HI> (whom the same Calm hindred from getting away, were constrained to begin the Fight again, which lasted till five a Clock in the Evening, with an incredible Fury. As for what concerns the <HI>English,</HI> most certainly, unless it were some few Vessels that fought against <HI>Torrington</HI>'s Order, the rest did nothing at all: So that the main Body of the <HI>French</HI> fell into the Rear of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet; so that having fought from Morning till Evening, and having defended themselves so long against such a prodigious Number of the Enemy, that assailed them on every side, they were so very much batter'd, that hardly Three were capable of making any Defence; which constrained them to make their way through the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, and bear away to the Coast of <HI>England,</HI> between <HI>Bevesier</HI> and <HI>Ferly;</HI> Admiral <HI>Frackel, Jean Dick,</HI> and Captain <HI>Northey</HI> were slain; the <HI>Vreislandt</HI> ha∣ving lost all her Masts, and not being to be towed off by reason of the Calm, was taken towards the end of the Fight. Admiral <HI>Evertsen</HI> gave this Testimony of all the <HI>Dutch</HI> Officers and Soldiers, That there was not one that did not exactly perform his Duty; and as for the Admiral himself, though he would not speak his own Praise, in his Letter to the States; yet all Men give him this Character, That he signalized himself by the greatest Actions that a true Valour could in∣spire, and which deserve an equal Fame with that of <HI>Trump</HI> or <HI>de Ruyter.</HI> In short, it was never heard that ever Twenty two Ships fought so long against Fourscore and Two, of which Seventeen carried no less than some Fourscore and some an hundred Guns.</P>
<P>As for what concerns the <HI>English,</HI> had we known no more than what the Ad∣miral of <HI>Holland</HI> out of his Modesty writes, we had known nothing at all: But in a Letter which a person of Honour in <HI>England</HI> wrote to the Lord <HI>Dursly,</HI> there is this Expression, which better informs us, <HI>That the</HI> Holland <HI>Squadron behaved themselves with so much Bravery, that if the Lord</HI> Torrington <HI>had done his Duty, in all probability we had won an absolute Victory.</HI> The <HI>English</HI> had but Two Captains slain, and Three Ships disabled, which are thought to be the only Ships that fought without the Lord <HI>Torrington</HI>'s Order.</P>
