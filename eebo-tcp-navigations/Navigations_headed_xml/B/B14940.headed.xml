<P>At Milanen are more Men taken on / and the Spanyards fortifie the place in Veltlin againe very stronglye / which doth not give any expecta∣tion of restitution.</P>
<P>The Duke of Savoy hath mustered his foote∣men and Horsemen.</P>
<P>From Constantinople is confirmed / that a ve∣rye great sorte of men goe for Polen and Hun∣garie.</P>
<P>Wee heare from Milanen / notwithstandinge commandement is come from Spaine twyse to restitute Veltlin / yet the Governour doth to the contrarye / sending manye men thither. The Arch-Duke Leopold doth the like / because that a while agone <HI>14.</HI> Companyes of Switsers are fallen into some part / beeinge under the Com∣mandement of the Duke of Austria / and burnt an Abbye / which doth keepe back the restitution yet the Spainyards must give it againe at last. They are verye much discontented / because the Duke of Savoy hath mustered so manye Men / wherein they can not tell what his intention is.</P>
<P> Wee heare from Constantinople / that the Great Turke with his principall Officers are broken up and gone to Adrianopel / and conducted by a great sort of Ianitsers and Iagy / his men of Warre should bee (besides the Tartars) <HI> 300000. </HI> strong / he hath taken out of the Tresurye with him 4½. Milisns Soltanini / for to paye his Men he hath also given his Generall of the Sea <HI> 400000. </HI> Soltanini. Who is gone with <HI> 70 </HI> ships in the black Sea / for to keepe the Cossacks back / who did threatten to com to Constantinople with theire Gallyes. Wee heare in other Letters: That the Great Turke will send <HI> 150000. </HI> Men in Polen / and <HI> 100000. </HI> in the Moldou / leavinge the Castles in Hungarie well provided for de∣fence. </P>
<P>With the Fortresse Nieuheusel it doth stand in former estate / it is wholy besieged / but they lye yet so farre from it / that no peece of Ordnance can reach it. This day there are sent more Can∣nons and Munition thither. In the meane time Bucquoy makes certaine thousands of Cannon∣baskets for defence / to shoote at Nieuheusel. The Souldiors of the Emperour shewe themselves heere very unwilling / because of bad payement. And a certaine time agone / are the <HI>4000.</HI> Hunga∣rians / which Betlem Gabor had sent with Mon∣nye and Munition for the assistance of Nieuheu∣sel / by the Souldiors of the Generall Filleck / and Setschi unawares fallen upon / beaten / and taken from them (among other things) <HI>25000</HI> Dallers / whereupon they of Nieuheuse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="keyers" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fall dayly our / and take many Horses and people imprisoned. They have also some dayes past driven the Lord Gene∣rall of Diepenbach wholy out of his quarter / so that the getting of this Fortresse may cost many a head / heere goeth also a speech that there shall bee some suspected persons imprisoned.</P>
