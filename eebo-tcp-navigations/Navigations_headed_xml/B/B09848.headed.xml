<HEAD>REASONS <HI>humbly Offered against the Establishing the present</HI> East-India <HI>Compa∣ny by Act of Parliament, exclusive of others, and confirming their Charters.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">I. BEcause that all the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> have an equal Right to Trade to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> by the Laws of the Land, and which the Honourable House of Commons have lately Declared and Asserted.</P>
<P N="2">II. Because that the Establishing this Company would give away that Right to a few Men only, which belongs to all the Subjects of <HI>England;</HI> and thereby exclude all the rest from it for 21 Years.</P>
<P N="3">III. Because that this Honourable House have in two Sessions o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Parliament made two Solemn Addresses to have this Company Dissolved, it's humbly su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="murp" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>posed, Their being Established contrary to their said Addresses, cannot be thought Merit sufficient to recom∣mend them to such an Establishment.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Because it would be so great a Service to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> to have a Company Establisht on so ill a Foundation; which would be so much less able to contest with them in that Trade, than a New Company founded on a National Bottom, with a clear Stock of Two Millions; that the <HI>Dutch</HI> might afford to furnish the Money, which is proposed to be advanced for.</P>
<P N="5">V. Because that the confirming this Companies Charter, would give them such Powers as are not fit to be trusted in any Subjects; much less in those who have already so much abused them, and by colour thereof have been guilty of such Arbitrary Proceedings, as well on the Lives, Liberties and Estates of their Fellow-Subjects, as to the Natives of <HI>India:</HI> and for some of which, they have been justly Censured in Parliament.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Because that it would countenance by a Law, one of the greatest Cheats that ever yet was practised; and that only to serve the Private Ends of a few Men, who have been the Promoters of it; and by their Arts and Tricks have procured New Subscriptions to be made to their Old Stock, which they knew was worth nothing: and the better to Decoy in others, have given Security, to some to make their 90 <HI>l.</HI> worth 100 <HI>l.</HI> in 6 Months time.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Because this Proposal is not made by the Company, or with their Consent, nor so much as a General Court called, to propose it to them; but is managed and promoted by those Security-Men, who now want the Credit of an Act of Parliament: to make them a saving Bargain, by raising the Stock: that so they may either Sell out, or not have it put upon them with so great a Loss.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Because there is no assurance, that this Proposal will be complied with; for many of the Adventurers are so far from approving of it, that they publickly express their dislike thereof. So that if it should be offered by the House, it may not perhaps be accepted.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Because it would Establish in a few Men of the Old Company, the greatest part of all that Trade, and give them, and such only as they please, the whole Power and Management of it; as they have had for several Years past, and have now lately secured to themselves by their New Charter; by reducing the Votes from 500 <HI>l.</HI> to 1000 <HI>l.</HI> and having ten Votes for 10000 <HI>l.</HI> which the New Subscribers would now gladly retrieve; and to that end have made Regulations, which the Governing-Men will not agree to: and the New Subscribers and the Old disagreeing about their New Regulations, if any of them them should get into the Committee at the Election in <HI>April</HI> next, they may perhaps be too nice in examining into the Particulars of the large Articles expended for <HI>Secret Service,</HI> and discover the miserable state of the Companys condition; which would occasion the Stock to fall, unless it can be thus Supported.</P>
<P N="10">X. Because, that at the Return of the two Ships, which were sent to the <HI>East-Indies</HI> by particular Men last year, the true state of the Companies Condition will then appear; and the fear of the consequence of having the truth thereof discovered, which they know is so bad, is the great Reason, That they are now so Solicitous to obtain an Establishment by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Because no other Reasons are given by those who promote the Confirming this Com∣pany, for so doing; but only their Lending 60000 <HI>l.</HI> without Interest to be advanced in three Years, and be Re-paid out of their own Customs: Which by a reasonable Computation cannot be supposed to amount to near so much as they have Paid for <HI>Secret Service,</HI> but is nevertheless more than they can perform, unless their Friends the <HI>Dutch</HI> help them to it, or that they procure others to Lend it for them: a Practice with which they have been well acquainted, when they have pretended to make Loans to Their Majesties; and have lately given by their Emissaries, 1 or 2 <HI>per Cent.</HI> more than the King Paid, to procure the Mo∣ney to be lent in their Members Names, by those who otherwise would have lent it to the Go∣vernment themselves without any such Compensation, so that the Publick has had no Advan∣tage by their pretended Loans.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Because that this is not a raising of Money for the Crown, but only a Borrowing of it, by anticipating the Revenue which is already Granted.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. Because, that if the Honourable House of Commons should incline (which it's hum∣bly hoped they will not) to Confirm this Company, with an Exclusion of the Right of all the Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> whom this Honourable House represents; only for their Lending 600000 <HI>l.</HI> If the same Method were to be taken in Raising Money on other Foreign Trades of this Kingdom, several Millions might be Raised thereby; and there are Persons who would make Proposals for the <HI>East-India</HI> Trade to be Settled in a New Company, far more Consi∣derable and Advantageous to the Publick, than what are now made for the Old Company.</P>
