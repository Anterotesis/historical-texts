<ARGUMENT>
<P>How Sir <HI REND="blackletterType">Guy</HI> Earl of <HI REND="blackletterType">Southampton,</HI> having married a fair Lady, had by her Sir <HI REND="blackletterType">Bevis;</HI> and how &s;he afterward cau&s;ed her Hus|band to be treacherou&s;ly &s;lain in the Forre&s;t, and married the Knight that &s;lew him &amp;c.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IN the days, when <HI>England</HI> was more immediately renowned, for the famous and valiant Atchievements of other Knightsland Warlike, Champions, who&s;e greht Actions and Heroick Enter|pri&s;es were loudly trumped by Faine, in each part of the World. There dwelt at the antient and celebrated Town of <HI>Southampton,</HI> a Knight called Sir <HI>Guy,</HI> who in his Travels and &s;earch of Adven|tures through the Countries of <HI>Flanders, France, Almain, Cicile, De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rk, Ga&s;com, Hungary, Culabria, Burgundy, Poland, Nor|mandy, Maine, Turkey, Ea&s;tland, Norway, Picardy, Scotland, Lumbardy, &amp;c.</HI> &s;ignalized his Valour in the Courrs of divers great Princes at Tilt, Tournament, and many mortal Combats, ever &s;triving to right the injured, and &s;uch as &s;uffered wrong <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> their too powerful oppre&s;&s;ors, and having &s;pent his younger days in the exerci&s;e of Arms abroad, every where gaining a high e&s;teem, at length Age rendring him unfit for great exploits, he re&s;olved to give up the remainder of his lift to a more &s;etled &s;tate in his own Country, and thereupon returning loaden with Lawrels won with infinite hazzard and danger, as al&s;o with the Pre&s;ents and Favour of Emperors, Kings and Princes: he at length &s;etled in the Town of <HI>Southamp|ton,</HI> the place of his birth, but long he had not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d there in all &s;o|litary conrentment, and adicted him&s;elf to works of Piery and Charity, before King <HI>Edgar</HI> having been &s;ufficiently informed of
<PB N="6" REF="4"> his high de&s;erts, made him Earl of that place, and calling him to Court, appointed him his Steward, or rather Vice-Roy, in which place he &s;o well di&s;charged his tru&s;t, in doing Iu&s;tice to every man, countenancing virtue and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing vice, that he gained an univer|&s;al commendation: and being now where he had dayly the &s;ight of a great many beautiful Ladies he bethought him&s;elf of Marriage, that &s;o he might leave behind him an Heir to po&s;&s;e&s;s his great Wealth and Virtues; and ca&s;ting his Eyes upon the Daughter of the King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who was then in the Engli&s;h Court, he &s;o prevailed with the King of <HI>Scots,</HI> by the means of King <HI>Edgar</HI> his Ma&s;ter, that he &s;oon had her to Wife; though this Marriage, by rea&s;on &s;he had &s;ecretly placed her affections before, on the Emperor of <HI>Edmain's</HI> Brother, prove altogether unhappy to the Earl, as in the &s;equel will appear.</P>
<P>The Marriage Rites being performed with great &s;plendor, and graced with the pre&s;ence of the two Kings, and the Nobles of both Kingdoms: In proce&s;s of time the Lady brought him forth a Son, whom they agreed to be called <HI>Bevis,</HI> afterward known, or common|ly called by the name of <HI>Bevis</HI> of <HI>Southampton,</HI> who&s;e Knighly Adven|tures and noble Actions are the &s;ubject of this plea&s;ant and renowned Hi&s;tory. However the Lady &s;till keeping up her affections for her former Lover, who&s;e name was Sir <HI>Murdure,</HI> by rea&s;on he was &s;prightly, young and active, and Sir <HI>Guy</HI> her Husband on the con|trary, being much in years, and not &s;o apt as &s;he required to &s;atis|fie her youthful de&s;ires, adicting him&s;elf rather to his Devotion, and to obtain a pardon for Sins by a thorough Repentance; which made her begin to conclude her &s;elf unhappy in this Marriage, and wi&s;hed &s;he had been given to him &s;he more dearly affected, &s;uffering her di&s;|content dayly to increa&s;e, till at length growing from a di&s;like to a hatred of her Lord: She re&s;olved to be rid of him, and thereupon &s;ent a tru&s;ty Me&s;&s;enger to the Emperors Court, to acquaint Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> of her great Love to him, and the di&s;like &s;he had of her Husband, a&s;&s;uring him, that he ever had her heart and entire affection, though forced by the commands of a Father, &s;he had given her hand to another, which made her life unea&s;ie, and that now there remained no way to render it comfortable, but by removing the man, who hindred the mingling of their mutual Pa&s;&s;ions and Af|fections, and that to compleat both their happyne&s;&s;e&s;s, he would un|dertake to kill him, &s;he would &s;o contrive it as to give him the op|portunity,
<PB N="7" REF="4"> by per&s;wading him with a &s;lender Train to hunt the Boa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the great Forre&s;t then adjoyning to the Town of <HI>Southampton,</HI> and there with a &s;trong well arm'd Guard might effect it at lea&s;ure.</P>

<P>At the wicked propo&s;al of the Lady, Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> &s;tood for a while mute and much amazed, but at la&s;t, the great Love he had ever born to &s;o beautiful a Woman, as was the Counte&s;s, and not knowing any other means to enjoy her, whom he now under&s;tood was as wil|ling to yield, as he to intreat, con&s;ented to obey her plea&s;ure, telling the Me&s;&s;enger, that on the fir&s;t day of <HI>May</HI> he would arrive in <HI>England</HI> with a Company of well arm'd men, &s;ufficient to bring a|bout what &s;he de&s;ired, and that done, lay him&s;elf at her feet, and re|ing him with a gallant Steed, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P>The Lady having heard the an&s;wer of the Knight, was much plea&s;ed thereat, and then upon feigning her &s;elf ill at ea&s;e, &s;he &s;ent a Servant to her Husband, to adverti&s;e him of it, who immediately came to her, and with much love and tenderne&s;s enquired into the

<P>The Earl thus &s;urprized, called to his Servants to advertize them of the Treachery, &s;aying, at the &s;ame time, he would however in his own right, defend him&s;elf to the utmo&s;t, when having his Launce in his Re&s;t, he run again&s;t Sir <HI>Murdure,</HI> and hitting him full, bore hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the ground, and thereupon drew his Sword, and being about to &s;trike off his Head, he cryed out to his Fellows for re&s;cue who came &s;o furiou&s;ly upon the Earl, that he was forced to de&s;i&s;t, and defend him&s;elf, when having &s;lain divers of them, they being twenty in number, and wanting his Armour, through the many wounds he had received, he was at la&s;t obleiged to for&s;ake his Hor&s;e, who was likewi&s;e &s;orely wounded, and about to fall under him, yet he fought couragiou&s;ly, but his Servants being &s;lain, and he inclo&s;ed on every &s;ide, fainting through lo&s;s of blood, he &s;aid to Sir <HI>Murdure,</HI> for the honour of Knighthood and true Chivalry at this time &s;pare my life, having me unarmed, at &s;o great a di&s;advantage, and I promi&s;e, old as I am to arm my &s;elf, and meet you and your Train, and if you kill me then, I &s;hall freely pardon you my death; but they would in no wi&s;e hearken to him, for whil&s;t he was about to proceed, in requiring his life to be &s;pared, Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> with his Spear run him through the body, and tho&s;e that accompanied him gave him &s;o many wounds that he dyed on the place; after which the unworthy Knight cut off his Head, and &s;ent it by one of his Servants, as a Pre&s;ent to the Lady,

</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>BEvis</HI> hearing of his Fathers Death, greatly lamented it; and being of &s;ome years of under&s;tanding, &s;oon perceived by his Mothers car|riage, and whi&s;perings among&s;t the Servants, as al&s;o Sir <HI>Murdure</HI>'s high
<PB N="10" REF="6"> Entertainment, that &s;he had not the lea&s;t hand in the contriving it, and thereupon took the freedom to tell her his thoughts, in &s;uch bitter Language as incen&s;ed her grievou&s;ly to cha&s;tize him; but finding him ob&s;tinate and fearing one day he would not only di&s;cover but revenge his Fathers Death, &s;he re&s;olved to make him away, and thereupon con&s;ulted with one Sir <HI>Sabre,</HI> over whom &s;he had a great power and influence, to de&s;troy him; who accordingly promi&s;ed it, without any intention to perform it. Wherefore, that he might keep notwith&s;tanding in her good opinion, he took him home to his Hou&s;e, pretending it required great Privacy; and there he informed the Youth of the danger he was in, and how that he had it in charge to kill him, but on the contrary was re&s;olved to conceal him, till &s;uch time he was able to bear Arms for the recovery of his Fathers E&s;tate: adding, That he, for the Friend&s;hip he bore Sir <HI>Guy,</HI> would then a&s;&s;i&s;t him with a power &s;ufficient to effect it, and whil&s;t he had an op|portunity, to convey him to his other Vncle, who was an Earl in <HI>Wales,</HI> he &s;hould keep his Sheep upon the neighbouring Downs. At this <HI>Bevis</HI> wept for anger, to be &s;o u&s;ed by his cruel Mother whil&s;t his Fathers Murtherer revelled in his Palace, yet concealed it as well as he could, in hopes, one day to be revenged, conde&s;cending to have his rich Cloaths changed for tho&s;e of a Shepherd, all tattered and ragged; and in that di&s;gui&s;e drove forth Sir <HI>Sabre</HI>'s Sheep each morning, warily guarding them upon the flowry Plains, and chearing him&s;elf with his Pipe of Reeds, wearing a Shepherds Scrip, and carrying in his hand a Crook, and at Even he brought them home again, contenting him&s;elf with cour&s;e Fare and a homely Lodging; till coming to the Age of &s;ixteen years he exerci&s;ed the fir&s;t proof of his valour upon a fierce and cruel Wolf, late|ly come into tho&s;e parts, that de&s;troyed not only many Sheep and tender Lambs but killed &s;ome of the Shepherds that &s;ought to defend them, and put others to the &s;light; and thinking to do the like to <HI>Bevis,</HI> who was com|ing to the Field, met him open-mouth'd, but <HI>Bevis</HI> with the end of his Crook &s;truck him &s;o full on the head as he came at him, that he fell to the Ground; when clo&s;ing with him, he with much ea&s;e &s;trangled him with main force, which made the Neighbouring Shepherds exceedingly rejoyce, and much prai&s;e the courage and re&s;olution of <HI>Bevis,</HI> who by this Act had delivered them from fear and danger. And &s;oon after he began to &s;how his &s;trength, in&s;omuch that none were able to contend with him, ei|ther at Wre&s;tling, Running, Throwing the Bar, or at hard Blows, &s;o that his Renown began by degrees to &s;pread abroad, and many both lo|ved and feared him.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="6">
<P><HI>Bevis</HI> not well plea&s;ed in his mind to follow this imploy, whil&s;t tho&s;e that were unworthy of it, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his Fathers E&s;tate, although he, as much as in him lay, &s;trugled to conceal his Quality: yet had he ma|ny Conflicts with him&s;elf, and thus expo&s;tulated: <HI>Shall I,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>who am the Son of an Earl, born to large F&ograve;rtunes, thus &s;uffer hun|ger and cold, go in tattered Garments and lye hard and unea&s;ie, the Ground being for the mo&s;t part my Bed, and the Sky my Canopy, it mu&s;t not be; but rather will</HI> Bevis <HI>&s;uffer any danger, and boldly contemn the malice and Fury of his Enemies.</HI> And whil&s;t he was in the&s;e meditations, he heard from the Town of <HI>Southampton</HI> the &s;ound of Trumpets, Hoitboys and Fluits, which made him addre&s;s him&s;elf to a Traveller coming from thence, to know the meaning of it, and from him under&s;tood that Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> held a great Fea&s;t, freely for all Per&s;ons that would participate of his Dainties in honour of his Mar|riage-day, which he had done every year on that occa&s;ion.

<PB N="12" REF="7"> he was in, he thought he might do without di&s;covery, and by that means learn &s;omething that might turn to his advantage. So leaving his Sheep at a venture, he ha&s;ted thither; but being about to enter, and the Porters &s;eeing him in &s;o tattered and ragged a Garment, they churli&s;hly thru&s;t him back, telling him, if he expected any of their Ma&s;ters Bounty he mu&s;t &s;tay in the Lodge, or at the Door, for &s;uch a beggarly Fellow as he mu&s;t not expect to &s;ort him&s;elf with &s;uch noble Gue&s;s as were in the Palace: at which being angry, <HI>Bevis</HI> replyed, that he mu&s;t and would en|ter and &s;it at the Table with the Ma&s;ter of the Palace him&s;elf, and to that purpo&s;e he was come. But they &s;till thru&s;ting him back and giving bad language, from words they fell to blows, when <HI>Bevis</HI> thor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ghly enraged fell'd one of them with his Fi&s;t, and layed the other with a &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ak of his Truncheon dead at his Feet, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ed into the Hall, where he found the Gue&s;s &s;eated in a &s;plendid manner, the Tables loaded with varieties of divers kinds, and Wine flowing in abundance; when <HI>Bevis</HI> finding an empty place &s;ate down, which Sir <HI>Murdure,</HI> who &s;ate with his Counte&s;s at the upper end of the Table, noting, and angry that &s;uch a Gue&s;s had been admitted, began to cha&s;e at his Porters, at the &s;ame time ri&s;ing from his Place, and charging him under the penalty of &s;evere puni&s;hments to depart: but <HI>Bevis</HI> told him he expected a bet|ter welcome, e&s;pecially in a place he had been &s;o intimate in; and that though he were in a poor Garment he knew not but that he was more noble de&s;cended than him&s;elf, and that in proof thereof, if he found him&s;elf ag|grieved, and if he might have Arms provided him he would enter the Com|bate again&s;t him&s;elf, or any Knight of the Company. This &s;o incen&s;ed Sir <HI>Murdure,</HI> that di&s;daining to reply, he drew his Sword to have taken his Head for offering, as he deemed it, &s;uch an affront to him&s;elf and his noble Gue&s;s: at which <HI>Bevis</HI> leaping from his place, with his Trun|cheon warded the Blow; nor then did he fail to hit Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> with &s;uch force, as brought him to the ground, and was about with a &s;econd &s;troak to fini&s;h his days, when the Counte&s;s and other Ladies cryed out to the Knights to run in and prevented it, and <HI>Bevis</HI> finding him|&s;elf amid&s;t &s;o many drawn Swords, thought it time to retire, which accordingly he did, &s;ecuring or making good his Retreat with Sir <HI>Mur|dure</HI>'s Sword, which he had wre&s;ted from him, wounding divers that had been too forward in pre&s;&s;ing on, crying in vain to the Porters to &s;hut the Gates and keep him in, that they might be revenged of the Affront.</P>
<P><HI>Bevis</HI> thinking him&s;elf partly revenged of his Father-in-law, went &s;ecretly to Sir <HI>Sabre</HI> and told him all that had pa&s;&s;ed, who was much

<P><HI>Bevis</HI> being now in the Court of <HI>Armony,</HI> the King had great delight to &s;ee a Youth &s;o comely, well &s;et and &s;trong proportioned in his Limbs, every part of him expre&s;&s;ing a more than manly form, and promi&s;ing ex|traordinary &s;trength; wherefore giving him words of comfort, he began to que&s;tion him about his Birth and Parentage, who freely told him that he was Son to <HI>Guy</HI> Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> and that his Father being treacherou&s;ly &s;lain by the con&s;ent of his Mother, who likewi&s;e &s;ought his Life, he had betaken him&s;elf to travel, and being unfortunately ta|ken Pri&s;oner, he had been &s;old to tho&s;e Merchants who had pre&s;ented him to his Highne&s;s. Vpon this the King embraced him, and told him he was now more dear to him, as being the Son of Sir <HI>Guy,</HI> who&s;e Fame had &s;ounded loud in tho&s;e parts, and his many noble Actions made his name immortal; however, grieving that the World had lo&s;t &s;o brave a Man by Treatchery, that could not have been overcome by fair force, con&s;tituted <HI>Bevis</HI> his great Chamberlain, committing to his care and charge Ve&s;tures of Gold, Silver and Pearls, Diamonds and other precious &s;tones and great riches in abundance, being wonderfully plea&s;ed, as often as his great Affairs would give him lei&s;ure, to hold di&s;|cour&s;e with him of many things, for <HI>Bevis</HI> was no ways ignorant of any Learning. And &s;o it happened, that he had not long been in this place with a promi&s;e of being made General of the King's Army, when occa|&s;ion &s;hould require, and to that purpo&s;e received the Order of Knighthood.</P>

<P>The King hearing <HI>Bevis</HI> thus unalterably fixed, and firm to the Faith he profe&s;&s;ed, waved to pre&s;s it further, and fell into other di&s;cour&s;e, and in the end, his great Affairs requiring him in the Palace, he departed.

<P>Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> kindly accepted this profer, upon the condition propo|&s;ed, and intreated them to land, which accordingly they did, and Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> with his men were highly treated, both by Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> and the Counte&s;s Sir <HI>Bevis</HI>'s Mother, who knew him not, for he had changed his name to that of Sir <HI>Gerard,</HI> ordering his men to call him by no other; when as Sir <HI>Murdure</HI> thus began, Noble Stranger, it may be you are ignorant of the cau&s;e that occa&s;ions this difference between me and Sir <HI>Sabre,</HI> a hardy Knight who&s;e re&s;idence is now in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> and this it is, &s;o it happened, that Sir <HI>Guy</HI> being &s;lain by misfortune in a neighbouring Forre&s;t, who was Earl of this Town, I married the Lady his Counte&s;s my pre&s;ent Wife, and &s;he having had one Son by the Earl named <HI>Bevis,</HI> who proving extravagant and expen&s;ive when of age I bought his Heritage of him, and he having con&s;umed the mony he received for it, left the Land and has not &s;ince been heard of; notwith&s;tanding this Sir <HI>Sabre</HI> who is his Vncle, being of late grown rich and powerful lays claim to it, and with many inroads and fierce Encounters di&s;turbs and invades my po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and now I have informed you of the ju&s;tne&s;s of my cau&s;e, I hope it will exault your Courages to defend my right.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> having heard the foregoing relation and knowing it to

</ARGUMENT>
<P>SIR <HI>Bevis,</HI> as we &s;aid, being in the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> we mu&s;t there leave him a while, and return to <HI>Jo&s;ian</HI> whom we left at <HI>Colen,</HI> and with her the Giant <HI>A&s;capart</HI> as her Guard, to prevent any danger that might befall her. So it fell out, That <HI>Jo&s;ian</HI> had not been long here, after the departure of Sir <HI>Bevis,</HI> but Sir <HI>Miles</HI> an Earl of that Country, ca&s;ting his Eyes upon her admirable Beauty, fell de&s;perately in love with her, and began in a pa&s;&s;ionate manner, to court her to his plea&s;ure, but &s;he refu&s;ing his proffer'd Love with disdain, he re&s;olved if he could not have his Will of her fairly, to have it by force, and in a manner told her his intent, to which &s;he replied, Sir, although Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> is ab&s;ent, yet have I here with me <HI>A&s;capart,</HI> that will not &s;ee me wronged: and by this means, he ha|ving under&s;tood in whom &s;he repo&s;ed her confidence, re&s;olved to get him out of the way, whil&s;t he acted his wicked purpo&s;e, and &s;o feign|ing a Letter to him, in Sir <HI>Bevis</HI>'s name, how that he mu&s;t im|mediately come to him, to the Ca&s;tle in the Sea, &s;tanding a league from the Shoar; the unthinking Giant went, when he no &s;ooner entred the Ca&s;tle, but it was &s;hut upon him, by tho&s;e that carried him, and the boat, as Sir <HI>Miles</HI> had agreed with the Boatmen, im|mediately rowed back again; and then he made his fre&s;h attempts up|on fair <HI>Jo&s;ian,</HI> telling her what he had done with <HI>A&s;capart,</HI> and now &s;he had nothing to hope in, but mu&s;t yield to his plea&s;ure or dye; whereupon &s;he &s;ecretly &s;ent a tru&s;ty Me&s;&s;enger, to certifie Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> of the dan|ger &s;he was in, which required his &s;peedy aid: and then to delay the fal&s;e Knight, &s;he told him, if he would marry her, he &s;hould have his will of her, but if he otherways attempted it, &s;he would rather dye than &s;uffer it to be done.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Miles,</HI> as I &s;aid, being pa&s;&s;ionately in love with the fair Queen, &s;tuck not at any thing &s;he propo&s;ed, &s;o that he might enjoy her, and having
<PB N="43" REF="22"> told her he would a&s;uredly do it, and thereupon obtaining a ki&s;s, the day was appointed, to be the next, and thereupon he prepared all manner of &s;umptuous Chear and Mu&s;ick, inviting many Barrons, Knights, and Ladies to his wedding, and &s;o married they were early in the morning, and the day being &s;pent in fea&s;ting; when it grew night and Supper ended, fair <HI>Jo&s;ian</HI> was led to her Bride-Chamber, and &s;oon after, impatient of delay, came Sir <HI>Miles</HI> with many atten|dants, but &s;he intreated him for mode&s;ties &s;ake to &s;end away his Train, and &s;he would be his Chamberlain; &s;o that at his command all departing, and they left together, &s;he finding now no other way to &s;ave her honour, made a &s;lip-knot of her Girdle and ca&s;ting it over his Neck, &s;trangled him, and afterward hung him upon a beam. And his Barrons and Knights finding him not abroad in the Morn|ing, as he was wont, imputing it to his new Love Incounters with the fair Bride, every one wi&s;hing him&s;elf in his place; &s;ome went to hunting, and others to the Church; but coming home at noon, and yet not finding him out of his Chamber, they had great marvel, in&s;omuch that one of them went to &s;ee what was the matter, and open|ing the door, &s;aid, <HI>Ari&s;e Earl</HI> Miles, <HI>for you have &s;lept a great while, wherefore I cannot but think your head akes, will you plea&s;e to have a Candle? Nay,</HI> replyed Io&s;ian, <HI>I will undertake his Head &s;hall ake no more, for I have unknit the wedding, and yonder you may &s;ee him hanging, my honour he &s;hall never de&s;troy, though for what I have acted, you may do with me as you plea&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The death of Sir <HI>Miles</HI> once known to his Friends, they made great &s;orrow for it, and with much anger proceeded to burn the fair <HI>Jo&s;ian</HI> at a &s;take, &s;o that the Fire being &s;et in order, and kindled by the Sea &s;ide, <HI>A&s;capart,</HI> who beheld it from the Ca&s;tle, imagining that Queen <HI>Jo&s;ian</HI> his Mi&s;tris was in danger bur&s;t in &s;under the Iron gates, and entring a Fi&s;hers boate, ju&s;t come into the Port, he rowed him&s;elf to the place where the Fire was, and found it to be true, as he had dread, for there he beheld the Queen in her &s;hift, ready to be put into the fire, and whil&s;t he was devi&s;ing how to re&s;cue her, Sir <HI>Bevis</HI> came riding up, and &s;eeing <HI>A&s;capart,</HI> &s;aid, Thief where has thou been? where has thou left <HI>Jo&s;ian</HI> my fair Queen, whom I gave thee in charge, that &s;he is thus forced to &s;end for me to de|liver her from danger? whereupon asking his pardon, he told him all that had happened, and &s;hewed him in what danger the Queen &s;tood, who had before their coming been &s;acraficed in the Flames, had
<PB N="44" REF="23"> not the Prie&s;t been long in &s;hrieving her.
