<DIV1 TYPE="text">
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<HEAD>From <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> Octob. <HI>3.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Letters from thence report the&s;e particulars following.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That there was arriued there an Emba&s;&s;adour out of <HI>Poland,</HI> who came with a &s;tately trayne of an hundred followers. His Errand was, for confirmation of the League, and continuation of the Peace, in the Reigne of this pre&s;ent Sultan <HI>Mu&s;tapha;</HI> which was after the end of the late Warres, made betweene his King, and the former Sultan <HI>O&s;man.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, That the purpo&s;e of making Warres again&s;t the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> holds &s;till: but that the preparations haue beene much hindered, and there haue fallen out many difficulties, which cro&s;&s;e the Tur|ki&s;h intentions: The chiefe of which was, That hee hauing committed mo&s;t of the preparations vnto the Ba&s;haw of <HI>Babylon,</HI> becau&s;e his Gouernment lyes next vnto <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> the Natiues and Subiects of <HI>Babylon</HI> had before made their Ba&s;haw to di&s;obey the Great Turkes Commaunds in that point: And when hee &s;ince &s;eemed willing to obey his Lord and Ma&s;ter, the <HI>Babylonians</HI> haue taken and burnt their Ba&s;haw and <HI>Mufti</HI> (the <HI>Mufti</HI> being their chiefe Prie&s;t or Pope of the Mahometan Religion) and haue &s;ince cho&s;en to them&s;elues new Gouernours; whom, if the Grand Seignior &s;hall offer to di&s;turbe, or di&s;place, they re|&s;olue to defend them&s;elues again&s;t him, and to put them&s;elues, for the more &s;ecuritie, vnder the protec|tion of the <HI>Sophi,</HI> or King of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> who, for &s;ome
<PB N="4" REF="4"> differences in Religion, is &s;till, and now e&s;pecially, the mortalle&s;t and powerfulle&s;t Enemy that the Great Turke hath.</P>
<P>This is al&s;o confirmed by other Letters, which came by the way of <HI>Venice:</HI> which affirme al&s;o, That the Re|bellion in <HI>Babylon</HI> is mo&s;t certaine; and that the Ba|&s;haw there (I take it, they meane the new Ba&s;haw of the Peoples chu&s;ing) holds great corre&s;pondencie with the King of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, the&s;e di&s;turbances in the Ea&s;terne parts of the Turki&s;h Empire, were al&s;o much encrea&s;ed by a Sedition in <HI>Egypt:</HI> Which Countrey al&s;o beeing vn|der the Turki&s;h Dominion, refu&s;ed to accept of their new Ba&s;haw, and made a mo&s;t furious Faction again&s;t him; &s;o that the whole Countrey was al&s;o ready to reuolt: but by the per&s;wa&s;ion of the former Ba&s;haw, then going out of his Office, the common people were &s;omething appea&s;ed, and entertayned their new Go|uernour.</P>
<P>And thus you &s;ee the di&s;tractions of this huge and va&s;te Turki&s;h Empire; which begins to change their Obedience, with the Murther of their former Prince: Which Seditions in the people, no doubt will be ea|gerly apprehended by the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who could willingly &s;ee euery one of the Ba&s;hawes (like the Captaines after <HI>Alexanders</HI> death) catch a &s;hare for him&s;elfe, that &s;o hee might be too &s;trong for any one of them &s;ingle; and at la&s;t, while&s;t they fight with him &s;euerally, hee might ouercome them all gene|rally.</P>

<HEAD>From Algier, Octob. <HI>5.</HI></HEAD>
<P>From <HI>Algiers</HI> the Letters come by the way of <HI>Ve|nice,</HI> whence they write; that the two famous En|gli&s;h Pyrats, Captaine <HI>Ward,</HI> and Captaine <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> and diuers others of their crew, are lately dead of the plague, which is extremely rife in many parts of <HI>Barbary.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Algiers</HI> againe they write, that the Amba&s;|&s;ador of the States of the Low Countryes Doctor <HI>Pinacker,</HI> had &s;o well &s;ped him&s;elfe in his amba&s;&s;age, that he had obtained an agreement betwixt tho&s;e of <HI>Algier,</HI> and the vnited Prouinces; and that hee had gotten libertie for diuers of his Countrimen, whom the Pyrats of <HI>Algier</HI> had taken at Sea, and made Gal|ley-&s;laues of, which he hauing obtained here, went for the &s;ame purpo&s;e towards <HI>Thunis,</HI> to di&s;charge tho&s;e Dutchmen, who were there held either in the Pri&s;ons, or in the Galleys.</P>
<P>From <HI>Algier</HI> againe they write, that the Pyrats had 42. &s;aile at &s;ea, excellently well prouided: And that &s;ome of them had lately brought in a mo&s;t rich Prize to <HI>Algier,</HI> which was a Spani&s;h Carrick bound from <HI>Lisbone</HI> in <HI>Portugall,</HI> for the Ea&s;t Indies; whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e|in were found diuers Che&s;ts of money, of Gold and Siluer, &amp;c.

<P>Thus you heare, that though <HI>Ward</HI> and <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> be dead, yet the Turkes haue Pyrates and Rouers enough to trouble all the Merchants that trade that way.</P>
