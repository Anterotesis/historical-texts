<P>After I had ended my &s;peech, I had &s;ome &s;hort di&s;cour&s;e with him in the Per&s;ian tongue who a|mong&s;t other things told me, that concerning my trauell to the City of <HI>Samarcand,</HI> he was not able to doe me any good, becau&s;e there was no great ami|ty betwixt the Tartarian Princes and him&s;elfe, &s;o that his commendatory letters would doe me no

good. Al&s;o he added, that the <HI>Tartars</HI> did &s;o deadly hate all Chri&s;tians, that they would certainely kill them when they came into their Country. So that he earne&s;tly di&s;waded me fro~ the iourny, if I loued my life and welfare; at la&s;t he concluded his di&s;|cour&s;e with me by a &s;um of mony that he threw downe from a windowe through which he looked out, into a &s;heete tied vp by the foure corners, and hanging very neer the ground a hundred peeces of &s;iluer, each worth two &s;hillings &s;terling, which cou~|teruailed ten pounds of our Engli&s;h mony: this bu&s;ines I carried &s;o &s;ecretly by the help of my Per|&s;ian, that neither our Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador, nor any other of my Countrimen (&s;auing one &s;peciall, pri|uate, &amp; intrin&s;ical friend) had the lea&s;t inkling of it, till I had throughly accompli&s;hed my de&s;igne: for I well knew that our Amba&s;&s;ador&punc; would haue &s;top|ped and Barracadocd all my proceeding therein, if he might haue had any notice thereof, as indeed he &s;ignified vnto me after I had effected my proiect, aleaging this for&s;ooth for his rea&s;on why he would haue hindered me, becau&s;e it would redound &s;ome what to the di&s;honour of our Nation, that one of our Countrey &s;hould pre&s;ent him&s;elfe in that beg|garly and poore fa&s;hion to the King out of an in&s;i|nuating humor to craue mony of him, but I an&s;we|red our Amba&s;&s;ador in that &s;tout &amp; re&s;olute man|ner after I had ended my bu&s;ines, that he was con|tented to cea&s;e nibling at me, neuer had I more need of mony in all my life then at that time: for in truth

I had but twenty &s;hillings &s;terling left in my pur&s;e by rea&s;on of a mi&s;chance I had in one of the Turkes Cities called <HI>Emert</HI> in the country of <HI>Me&s;o|potamia,</HI> where a mi&s;creant Turke &s;tripped me of al|mo&s;t all my monies, according as I wrote vnto you in a very large letter the la&s;t yeer, which I &s;ent from the Court of this mighty Monarch by one of my Countrimen that went home by Sea in an Engli&s;h &s;hippe laden with the commodities of this <HI>India,</HI> which letter I hope came to your hands long &s;ince. After I had been with the King, I went to a certaine noble &amp; generous Chri&s;tian of the Armenia~ race, 2 daies iourny fro~ the <HI>Mogols</HI> court, to the end to ob|&s;erue certain remarkable matters in the &s;ame place, to whom by means of my Per&s;ian tongue I was &s;o welcome that hee entertained me with very ciuill and courteous complement, and at my departure gaue mee very bountifully twenty peeces of &s;uch kind of mony as the King had done before, cou~ter|uailing 40 &s;hillings &s;terling. About ten daies after that, I departed fro~ <HI>Azmere</HI> the court of the Mogol Prince, to the end to begin my Pilgrimage after my long re&s;t of fourteen moneths back againe into <HI>Per|&s;ia,</HI> at what time our Amba&s;&s;ador gaue mee a peece of Gold of this Kings Coine worth foure and twen|ty &s;hillings, which I will &s;aue (if it be po&s;&s;ible) till my ariuall in <HI>England:</HI> &s;o that I haue receiued for beneuolences &s;ince I came into this country twenty markes &s;terling &s;auing two &s;hillings eight pence, &amp; by the way vppon the confines of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> alitle be|fore

<HEAD>&leaf; <HI>The Copy of a &s;peech that J</HI> made to a Mahometan in the Italian tongue.</HEAD>
<P>THe Coppy of a &s;peech that I made extempo|re in the <HI>Italian tongue</HI> to a Mahometan at a Citie called <HI>Moltan</HI> in the <HI>Ea&s;terne India,</HI> two daies iourny beyond the famous Riuer <HI>Indus,</HI> which I haue pa&s;&s;ed, again&s;t <HI>Mahomet</HI> and his accur|&s;ed Religion, vpon the occa&s;io~ of a di&s;curte&s;ie offe|red vnto mee by the &s;aid Mahometan in calling me <HI>Gtaur,</HI> that is infidell, by rea&s;on that I was a Chri&s;ti|an: the rea&s;on why I &s;pake to him in <HI>Italian,</HI> was be|cau&s;e he vnder&s;tood it, hauing been taken &s;laue for many yeeres &s;ince by certaine Florentines in a Gal|ly wherein hee pa&s;&s;ed from <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> towards <HI>Alexandra,</HI> but being by them interrupted by the way, he was carried to a Citie called <HI>Ligorne</HI> in the Duke of <HI>Florences</HI> Dominions, where after two yeeres he had learned good <HI>Italian,</HI> but he was an Indian borne and brought vp in the Mahometan Religion. I pronounced the &s;peech before an hun|dred people, whereof none vnder&s;tood it but him|&s;elfe, but hee afterward told the meaning of &s;ome part of it as far as he could remember it to &s;ome of the others al&s;o. If I had &s;poken thus much in <HI>Tur|ky,</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> again&s;t <HI>Mahomet</HI> they would haue ro&s;t|ed me vpon a &s;pitt; but in the <HI>Mogols</HI> Dominions a Chri&s;tian may &s;peake much more freely then hee can in any other Mahometan Country in the world. The &s;peech was this as I afterward tran&s;la|ted it into Engli&s;h.</P>

<P>Learning (which is the mo&s;t precious Iew|ell that man hath in this life, by which he at|taineth to the knowledge of diuine and hu|mane things) commeth to man either by re|uelatio~ which we otherwi&s;e cal in&s;piration, or by indu&s;try: Learning by reuelation I cal that which God doth infu&s;e from aboue by his &s;pecial grace, vnto tho&s;e who~ he will v&s;e as the in&s;truments of his glory, who with|out labour or trauell doe a&s;pire to a mo&s;t eminent degree of knowledge.

neither of the&s;e meanes haue the Mahome|tans acquired any meane, much le&s;&s;e any &s;ingular learning, for as <HI>Mahomet</HI> him&s;elfe was a man of a very &s;uperficiall and meane learning, &s;o neuer was there any one of his Di&s;ciples in any part of the world that was indued with any profound knowledge&punc; but wee Chri&s;tians by the one and the other meane, haue attained to the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;cience that can be incident to man: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I mean the ble&s;&s;ed Apo|&s;tles of our Sauiour.</NOTE>&s;ome of our men that neuer were brought vp in Studies hauing been &s;o expert in a generall learning (onely by Gods &s;peciall illumina|tion) as tho&s;e haue &s;pent forty yeeres in the practi&s;e thereof, and others by continuall practi&s;e of writing and reading, haue beene &s;o excellent, that they became the very Lampes and Stars of the Countries where|in they liued.
