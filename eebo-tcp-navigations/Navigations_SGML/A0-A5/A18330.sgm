<HEAD>&leaf; The valiant and mo&s;t laudable fight performed on the Sea, by the <HI>Centurion</HI> of London.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_IN the moneth of <HI>Nouember</HI> la&s;t</HI> pa&s;t, there were &s;undry Shyps appertay|ning to &s;euerall Marchants of <HI>London,</HI> which were rigde and fraught, forth with marchandize, &s;ome for <HI>Spaine,</HI> and &s;ome for &s;undry other places of traffique, who together hauing wind and wether, which oft-time fell out very vncertaine, arriued &s;afely in &s;hort &s;pace, at &s;uch places as they de&s;ired, among whom was the <HI>Centurion</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> a very tall Shyppe of burden, yet but weakely manned, as appeareth by this Hi&s;torie en&s;uing; wherein God &s;hewed a mo&s;t wonderfull accident of his mercifull loue and fauour towards them, giuing them the victory, and deliuering them from the hands of their E|nemies, at &s;uch time as it was thought vnpo&s;&s;ible for them to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Thys afore&s;aid Shyp called the <HI>Centurion,</HI> &s;afely arri|ued at <HI>Mar&s;eelis,</HI> where after they had deliuered their goods, they &s;taied about the &s;pace of fiue w&eacute;ekes, and better, and then tooke in lading, intending to returne to England.</P>
<P>Now when the <HI>Centurion</HI> was ready to come away fro~ <HI>Mar&s;eelis,</HI> there were &s;undry other &s;hyps of &s;maller burden, entreated the Mai&s;ter thereof, who&s;e name is <HI>Robert Brad|&s;hawe,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="3"> dwelling at the <HI>Lime-hou&s;e,</HI> to &s;tay a day or two for them, vntill they were in a readines to depart with them, thereby per&s;wading them, that it would be farre better for them to &s;tay and goe together in re&s;pect of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, then to depart of them&s;elues without company, and &s;o hap|pily for want of ayde fall into the hands of theyr Enemies in the Spani&s;h Gallies. Vpon which rea&s;onable per&s;wa&s;i|on, notwith&s;tanding that thys Ship was of &s;uch &s;ufficiencie as they might hazard her in the danger of the Sea, yet they &s;tayed for tho&s;e little Ships according to theyr reque&s;t, who together did put to Sea from <HI>Mar&s;eelis,</HI> and vowed in gene|rall not to flie one from another, if &s;o they &s;hould happen to meete with any Spani&s;h Gallies, beeing re&s;olute rather to fight it out, then once to be taken by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to endure their accu&s;tomed crueltie.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;mall Shippes accompanied with the <HI>Centurion,</HI> &s;ayling along the Co&s;te of <HI>Spaine,</HI> was vpon E&s;ter day la&s;t in the &s;traights of <HI>Iebualtare</HI> &s;uddainly becalmed, where im|mediatly they &s;awe &s;undry Gallies make towards them, in very valiant and couragious &s;orte: the chiefe Leaders and Souldiours in tho&s;e Gallies, brauely apparrelled in &s;ilke Coates, with &s;iluer whi&s;tles about theyr necks, and great plumes of Feathers in theyr Hafs, who with theyr Calli|uers, &s;hotte at the <HI>Centurion</HI> &s;o fa&s;t as they might: &s;o that by tenne of the clock and &s;omewhat before, they had boorded the <HI>Centurion,</HI> who before theyr comming, had prepared for them, and intended to giue them &s;o &s;ower a welcom as they might. And thereupon hauing prepared theyr clo&s;e fights, &amp; al things in a readines, they called vpon God, on who~ onely they tru&s;ted: and hauing made theyr prayers, and cheered vp one another to fight &s;o long as life endured, they began to di&s;charge theyr great Ordinaunce vpon the Gallies, but the little Shyps dur&s;t not come forward, but lay aloofe, while fiue Gallies had hoorded them, yea and with theyr grapling yrons made theyr Gallies fa&s;t to the &s;aid Shippe called the <HI>Centurion.</HI></P>
<PB N="5" REF="3">
<P>The Gallies were grapled to the <HI>Centurion</HI> in thys manner, two lay on one &s;ide, and two on another, and the Admirall lay full in the &s;terne, which galled &amp; battered the <HI>Centurion</HI> &s;o &s;ore, that her maine Ma&s;t was greatly weake|ned, her &s;ayles filled with many holes, and the Mizzen and &s;terne made almo&s;t vn&s;eruiceable.</P>
<P>During which time there was a &s;ore and deadly fight on both &s;ides, in which, the Trumpet of the <HI>Centurion,</HI> &s;own|ded forth the deadly points of war, &amp; encouraged the~ to fight manfully again&s;t their aduer&s;aries: on the contrary part, there was no warlike Mu&s;icke in the Spani&s;h Gallies, but onely their why&s;tles of &s;iluer, which they &s;ounded foorth to theyr owne contentment: in which fight many a Spaniard was turned into the &s;ea, and they in multitudes came crau|ling and hung vpon the &s;ide of the &s;hippe, intending to haue entred into the &s;ame, but &s;uch was the courage of the Eng|li&s;hmen, that &s;o fa&s;t as the Spaniards did come to enter, they gaue them &s;uch entertainment, that &s;ome of them were gladde to tumble aliue into the &s;ea, beeing remediles for e|uer to gette vp aliue. In the <HI>Centurion</HI> there was in all, of men and boyes, forty and eyght, who together fought mo&s;t valiantly, and &s;o galled the enemy, that many a braue and lu&s;ty Spaniard lo&s;t his life in that place.</P>
<P>The <HI>Centurian</HI> was fyred fyue &s;euerall times, with wilde fyre and other proui&s;ion, which the Spaniards threw in for that purpo&s;e: yet God be thanked, by the great and dilligent fore-&s;ight of the Ma&s;ter it did no harme at all.</P>
<P>In euery of the Gallies there was about fiue or &s;ixe hundereth Souldiours: who together with the &s;hotte, &s;poyled, rent, and battered the <HI>Centurion</HI> very &s;ore: &s;hotte through her maine Ma&s;t, and &s;lew foure of the men in the &s;ayde &s;hippe, the one of them b&eacute;eing the Ma&s;ters mate.</P>
<P>Ten other per&s;ons were hurt, by meanes of &s;plinters which the Spaniards &s;hotte: yea, in the ende when their proui&s;ion was almo&s;t &s;pent, they were con&s;trayned to &s;hoote at them hammers, and the chaines from theyr &s;laues,
<PB N="6" REF="4"> and yet God be thanked, they receiued no more domage: but by &s;poyling and ouer wearying of the Spaniards, the Eng|li&s;hmen con&s;trayned them to vngrapple them&s;elues, and gette them going, and &s;ure if there had b&eacute;ene any other fre&s;h &s;hyp or &s;uccour to haue releiued and a&s;&s;i&s;ted the <HI>Centurion,</HI> they had &s;layne, &s;uncke, or taken all tho&s;e Gallies and theyr Souldiours.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dolphin</HI> lay a loofe of and dur&s;t not come neere, while the other two &s;mall &s;hyppes fledde away, &s;o that one of the Gallyes went from the <HI>Centurion</HI> and &s;ette vpon the <HI>Dolphin,</HI> which &s;hyppe immediatly was &s;et on fire with theyr owne powder, wherby both men and &s;hyppe peri&s;hed: but whether it was with theyr good wills or no, that was not knowne vnto the <HI>Centurion,</HI> but &s;ure if it had come for|ward, and beene an ayde vnto the <HI>Centurion,</HI> it is to be &s;up|po&s;ed that it hadde not peri&s;hed.</P>
<P>Fiue houres and a halfe this fight continued, in which time both were glad to depart onely to breath them&s;elues, but when the Spaniards were gonne, they neuer dur&s;t re|turne to fight: yet the next day &s;ixe other Gallies came and looked at them, but dur&s;t not at any hand meddle with them. Thus God deliuered them from the hands of their enemies, and gaue them the victory: for which they hartily pray&s;ed God, and are now &s;afely arriued in London.</P>
