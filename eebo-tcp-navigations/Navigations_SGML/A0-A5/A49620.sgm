<P>It were needle&s;&s;e to tell you, by how many titles this little Orphan booke, claimes the honour of your Lord^p^s protection. Fir&s;t, by the law of nature, its parent dying in your &s;eruice, you stand bound to bee a

But to pa&s;&s;e by the&s;e two, there is yet a third rea&s;on, wherby it will appeare, not the effect of choi&s;e, but of nece&s;&s;ity, that it should come forth vnder the fauour of your name: The wellgrounded experience which you haue gained in your trauells; the exacte and iudicious account you are able to giue of the places you haue &s;een, which make a great part of the &s;ubiect of this booke; the mature iudgment of the intere&s;ts of &s;tates, and manners of people wherof it treats, which in you is not the after fruit of age;
<PB REF="4">
the Gentile and courteous behauiour which you haue acquired, and which charmes all tho&s;e who haue the honour to conuer&s;e with you: The&s;e, I &s;ay, are vertues &s;o peculier to your Per&s;on, and &s;o con&s;picuous in the eyes of all the world, that the de&s;igne of this Booke being to forme the like in the re&s;t of the Gentry of our Nation that pretend to trauell; It would bee a wrong to the publike to let it appeare vnder the Patronage of any other then of him that is the Idea of an accomplisht and consu~mate Traueller.

<HEAD>A PREFACE TO THE READER, CONCERNING TRAVELLING.</HEAD>
<P>_WHEN I fir&s;t &s;et pen to Paper to handle this &s;ub|ject, I had not the lea&s;t thought of the <HI>pre&s;&s;e;</HI> nor of erecting my &s;elfe into an <HI>Author.</HI> J onely di&s;charged my me|mory ha&s;tily of &s;ome things which J had &s;een, in <HI>Italy;</HI> and wrapt vp that vntimely <HI>Embrio</HI> in fiue sheets of pa|per, for the v&s;e of a noble per&s;on, who &s;et me that taske. Yet this <HI>Embrio</HI> like|ing the per&s;on for whom it was con|ceiued, obliged me to lick it ouer and ouer againe, and bring it into better forme. Second thoughts, and &s;ucceding voyages into <HI>Italy,</HI> haue finished it at la&s;t; and haue made it what it is; <HI>A compleat Voyage,</HI> and an exact <HI>Itinerary</HI> through <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>And here I thought to haue drawne
<PB REF="8">
bridle and re&s;ted, after &s;o long a iour|ney; when a learned friend hauing per|u&s;ed this my <HI>De&s;cription</HI> of <HI>Italy,</HI> de&s;ired much to &s;ee a <HI>Preface</HI> to it, of my fashion, and <HI>Co~cerning Traueling.</HI> I could refu&s;e nothing to &s;uch a freind; and haue done it here willingly, both for my owne, and my countryes &s;ake.</P>
<P><HI>For my owne sake;</HI> to preexcu&s;e &s;ome things in my booke, which &s;ome per|chance may di&s;like.</P>
<P>For &s;ome, I feare, will quarrel with my English; and ju&s;tly, &s;eeing three long voyages into <HI>Flanders,</HI> &s;ix into <HI>France,</HI> fiue into <HI>Italy,</HI> one into <HI>Ger|many,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> haue made mee, liue half of my life time in forrain countryes, to the di&s;turbance of my owne language. Yet if J bring not home fine language, J bring home fine things: and I haue &s;een great Ladyes, both in <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> buy finde things of <HI>chimney-&s;weepers,</HI> and <HI>Pedlars,</HI> that &s;poke but cour&s;e <HI>Lombard</HI> lan|guage, and gro&s;&s;e <HI>Scotch.</HI></P>
<P>Others perchance will finde fault, that J write merrily &s;ometimes: And why not? Seeing I write to young men, and for them: and mirth is neuer &s;o lawfull as in traueling, where it shor|tens
<PB REF="8">
long miles, and &s;weetens bad v&s;age; that is, makes a bad <HI>dinnar</HI> go downe, and a bad <HI>hor&s;e</HI> go on.</P>
<P>Others will &s;ay, that I fill my booke with too much <HI>Latin:</HI> But the&s;e mu&s;t be minded, that I am writing of the <HI>Latin</HI> country; and that I am caruing for <HI>Schollers,</HI> who can di&s;|ge&s;t &s;olid bitts, hauing good &s;tomacks.</P>
<P>Others will &s;ay, J ieere now and then: And would any man haue me go through &s;o many diuers countries, and pray&s;e all I &s;ee? Or in earne&s;t, do not &s;ome things de&s;erue to be ieered? when things cannot be cured but by ieering, ieering, &s;ayth <HI>Tertullian,</HI> is a duty: and I thinke the <HI>Cynick</HI> Philo|&s;ophers &s;truck as great a blow at vice, as the <HI>Stoicks.</HI></P>
<P>Others will &s;ay, I change &s;tile often, and &s;ometimes ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;moothly, &s;ometi|mes joltingly: Tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">raueled not all|wayes vpon &s;mooth ground, and pace|ing hor&s;es: <HI>Swi&s;&s;erlande</HI> and <HI>Sauoye,</HI> are much different, from <HI>Campania,</HI> and <HI>Lombardy;</HI> and its one thing to de&s;cribe a <HI>Plea&s;ant garden,</HI> an other thing to de&s;cribe a <HI>Venerable Cathe|drall</HI>: and if in the one, and the other, we haue &s;eueral lookes; much more
<PB REF="9">
ought we to haue &s;eueral words in de|&s;cribing them.</P>
<P>Others will &s;ay, I affect a world of exotick words not yet naturalized in <HI>England</HI>: No, I affect them not; I cannot auoyd them: For who can &s;peak of <HI>Statues,</HI> but he mu&s;t &s;peak of <HI>Ni|ches?</HI> or of <HI>Churches,</HI> Wrought <HI>Tombes,</HI> or inlayd <HI>Tables;</HI> but hee mu&s;t speak of <HI>Coupolas;</HI> of <HI>ba&s;&s;i ri|lieui;</HI> and of <HI>pietre comme&s;&s;e?</HI> If any man vnder&s;tand them not, its his fault, not mine.</P>
<P>Others will &s;ay, I hunt too much after <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> and Church anti|quityes. No, I onely meet them. And as a man cannot &s;peak of <HI>Hercules,</HI> but he mu&s;t &s;peak of <HI>clubbs,</HI> of <HI>com|bats,</HI> of <HI>Labours,</HI> and <HI>victories</HI>: &s;o I cannot &s;peak of <HI>Rome</HI> the Christian, but I mu&s;t &s;peake of <HI>Relicks, Cere|monies,</HI> and <HI>Religion.</HI> Yet I beleeue, I giue my Reader a full drought to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of prophane <HI>antiquityes, Ma&s;carades, Shews, dre&s;&s;ings,</HI> and <HI>pa&s;&s;etimes.</HI></P>
<P>Others in fine will &s;ay, that I do but a thing done allready; &s;eeing two others haue written of this &s;ubiect in <HI>English.</HI> Well; if others haue written vpon this &s;ubiect, why may not I? They did the
<PB REF="9">
be&s;t they could, I beleeue; but they drew not vp the ladder after them. The one writes much of <HI>Italy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">M. War|cupp. M. Ray|mond.</NOTE> and &s;ays little: the other writes little and leaueth out much; which I impute to the ones writing out of old Geographers, long after he had been there: and to the others short stay in <HI>Italy,</HI> when he was there. And if the&s;e ingenious gentlemen haue painted out <HI>Italy</HI> in <HI>bu&s;to</HI> onely, and <HI>profile;</HI> why may not I paint her out at <HI>full face,</HI> and <HI>at her full length</HI>? If they, like ancient Sta|tuaryes, haue repre&s;ented <HI>Italy</HI> vnto vs like a <HI>naked &s;tatue;</HI> I haue &s;et her out in all her <HI>be&s;t Attire,</HI> and <HI>Iew|els.</HI> And thus much for my owne &s;ake.</P>
<P><HI>For my countryes &s;ake;</HI> To read to my countrymen two profitable <HI>Le&s;|&s;ons.</HI> The fir&s;t, <HI>of the Profit of tra|ueling.</HI> The &s;econd: <HI>of Traueling with profit.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. For the first, to wit <HI>the Profit of Traueling,</HI> its certain, that if this world be a great <HI>booke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The profit of trauel|ing.</NOTE> as <HI>S. Augu&s;|tin</HI> calls it, none &s;tuddy this <HI>great Booke</HI> &s;o much as the Traueler. They that neuer &s;tirr from home, read one|ly one page of this <HI>booke;</HI> and like
<PB REF="10">
the dull follow in <HI>Pliny,</HI> who could neuer learne to count further then fiue, they dwell allwayes vpon one le&s;&s;on. They are like an acquaintance of mine, who had alwayes a booke indeed lyeing open upon a deske; but it was ob&s;erued that it lay allwayes open at one and the &s;ame place, and by long cu&s;tome, could lye open no where el&s;e. He then that will know much out of this great booke, the world, mu&s;t read much in it: and as <HI>Vly&s;&s;es</HI> is &s;etforth by <HI>Homer</HI> as the wi&s;e&s;t of all the <HI>Gre|cians,</HI> becau&s;e he had traueled much, and had &s;een <HI>multorum hominum mores &amp; Vrbes, the Cittyes and cu&s;tomes of many men:</HI> &s;o his &s;onn <HI>Telemachus</HI> is held for a very shallow witted man: and <HI>Homer</HI> giues the rea&s;on, becau&s;e his mother <HI>Penelope,</HI> in&s;tead of &s;ending him abroad to &s;ee forrain countryes, had allwayes kept him at home, and &s;o made him a meere <HI>Onocephalus,</HI> and a homeling <HI>Mammacuth.</HI> So true is the &s;aying of <HI>Seneca,</HI> that <HI>Imperitum e&s;t animal homo, &amp; &s;ine magna experientia re|rum, &s;i circum&s;cribatur Natalis &s;oli &s;ui fine.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2</HI> Traueling pre&s;erues my yong no|bleman
<PB REF="10">
from &s;urfeiting of his parents, and weanes him from the dangerous fondne&s;s of his mother. It teacheth him whole&s;ome hardship; to lye in beds that are none of his acquaintance; to &s;peak to men he neuer &s;aw before; to trauel in the morning before day, and in the euening after day; to endure any hor&s;e and weather, as well as any meat and drink. Whereas my country gentleman that neuer traueled, can &s;carce go to <HI>London</HI> without makeing his <HI>Will,</HI> at lea&s;t without wetting his <HI>hand|kercher.</HI> And what generous mother will not &s;ay to her &s;onn with that an|cient? <HI>Malo tibi mal&egrave; e&s;&s;e,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec.</NOTE> <HI>qu&agrave;m molliter: I had rather thou should&s;t be &s;ick, then &s;oft.</HI> Indeed the <HI>coral-tree</HI> is neither hard, nor red, till ta|ken out of the Sea, its natiue home. And I haue read that many of the old <HI>Romans</HI> put out their children to be nurced abroad by <HI>Lacedemonian nur|ces,</HI> till they were three yeares old; then they put them to their <HI>Vncles,</HI> till &s;eauen, or tenn; then they &s;ent them into <HI>To&s;cany</HI> to be in&s;tructed in <HI>Religion;</HI> and at la&s;t into <HI>Greece</HI> to &s;tuddy <HI>Philo&s;ophy.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> Traueling takes my yong noble|man
<PB REF="11">
four notches lower, in his &s;elf-conceit and pride. For wheras the coun|try <HI>Lord</HI> that neuer &s;aw any body but his Fathers <HI>tennants,</HI> and <HI>M. Par|&s;on,</HI> and neuer read any thing but <HI>Iohn Stow,</HI> and <HI>Speed;</HI> thinks the <HI>Lands-end</HI> to be the <HI>Worlds-end;</HI> and that all &s;olid greatne&s;&s;, next vnto a great <HI>Pa&s;ty,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in a great <HI>Fire,</HI> and a <HI>great e&s;tate.</HI> Wheras my traueling yong <HI>Lord,</HI> who hath &s;een &s;o many greater men, and E&s;tats then his owne, comes home farre more mode&s;t and ciuil to his inferiours, and farre le&s;&s;e pufft vp with the empty conceit of his owne greatne&s;&s;. Indeed nothing cured <HI>Alcibiades</HI> his pride &s;o much, as to &s;ee in a <HI>Map</HI> (shewd him for the nonce by <HI>Socrates</HI>) that his hou&s;e and lands, of which he was &s;o prowd, either ap|peared there not at all, or onely a little &s;pot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Senec:</NOTE> or dab: and <HI>nemo in pu&s;illo mag|nus.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> Traueling takes off, in &s;ome &s;ort, that <HI>aboriginal cur&s;e,</HI> which was layd vpon mankind euen allmo&s;t at the beginning of the world; I meane, the <HI>confu&s;ion of tongues</HI>: which is &s;uch a cur&s;e indeed, that it makes men, who are of one kind, and made to be
<PB REF="11">
&s;ociable, &s;o &s;trangely to fly one an other, that, as great <HI>S. Au&s;tin</HI> &s;ayth, A man had rather be with his dog, then with a man who&s;e language he vnder&s;tands not. Nay, this diuer&s;ity of language, makes the wi&s;e&s;t man pa&s;&s;e for a foole in a &s;trange country, and the be&s;t man, for an excommunicated per&s;on, who&s;e conuer&s;ation all men auoyd. Now, traueling takes off this <HI>cur&s;e,</HI> and this moral <HI>excommunication,</HI> by making vs learne many languages, and con|uer&s;e freely with people of other coun|tryes.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>5.</HI> Traueling makes vs acquainted with a world of our kinred we neuer &s;aw before. For &s;eing we are all comne from one man at first, and con&s;equent|ly all akinn to one another; its but a rea&s;onable thing, that a man should, once at lea&s;t in his life time, make a journey into forrain countries, to &s;ee his <HI>Relations,</HI> and vi&s;it this <HI>kinred:</HI> haueing allwayes this &s;aying of young <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> in his mouth; <HI>quaero fratres meos</HI></P>
<P N="6"><HI>6.</HI> Traueling enables a man much for his countryes &s;eruice. It makes the <HI>merchant</HI> rich, by shewing him what
<PB REF="12">
abounds, &amp; wantes, in other coun|tryes; that &s;o he may know what to import, what to export. It makes the <HI>mechanick</HI> come loaden home with a world of experimental knowledge for the improueing of his trade.

yong gentleman. <HI>Manfred</HI> was both courtier enough, and wi&s;e enough, to vnder&s;tand this to be no &s;mall honour; and therefore embraced her affection with a cor|re&s;ponding flame. In a word, they meet often; talke of it; giue mu+tual promi&s;es; make all the money they can, and iewels, and flye away &s;ecretly. They come into <HI>Italy,</HI> land at <HI>Naples,</HI> from thence to <HI>Ra|uenna</HI>; and at la&s;t pitch vpon this country where now <HI>Mirandula</HI> &s;tands. It was then a place ouer&s;pred with thickets and vnderwoods, and fur|nishing &s;ome pa&s;turage for sheep, and cottages for shepheards.
