<HEAD>A verie late and great probabilitie <HI>of a pa&s;&s;age, by the Northwe&s;t</HI> part of America in 58. degrees of Northerly latitude.</HEAD>
<P>_AN excellent learned man of portingale, of &s;inguler grauety, authoritie and experience tolde mee very lately, that one <HI>Anus Cortereal,</HI> captayne of the yle of Tercera about the yeere <HI>1574.</HI> which is not aboue eight yeres pa&s;t, &s;ent a Shippe to di&s;|couer the Northwe&s;t pa&s;&s;age of America, &amp; that the &s;ame &s;hippe arriuing on the coa&s;t of the &s;aide America in fiftie eyghte degrees of latitude, founde a great entrance exceeding deepe and broade, without all impediment of ice, into whiche they pa&s;&s;ed aboue twentie leagues, and found it alwaies to trende towarde the South, the lande lying lowe and plaine on ey|ther &s;ide: And that they per&s;waded them &s;elues verely, that there was a way open into the &s;outh &s;ea. But their victailes fayling them, and being but one &s;hippe, they returned backe agayne with ioy. This place &s;eemeth to lie in equal degrees of latitude, with the fir&s;t entrance of the &s;ounde of Denmark betweene Norway and the head land, called in latin <HI>Cimbro|rum promontorium,</HI> and therefore like to bee open and naui|gable a great part of the yeere. And this report may bee well annexed vnto the other eight rea&s;ons mentioned in my epi|&s;tle dedicatorie, for proofe of the likelihood of this pa&s;&s;age by the Northwe&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>&leaf; To the right wor&s;hipfull and <HI>mo&s;t vertuous Gentleman ma&s;ter</HI> Phillip Sydney E&s;quire.</HEAD>
<P>_I Maruaile not a little (right wor|&s;hipfull) that &s;ince the fir&s;t di&s;co|uerie of America (which is nowe full foure&s;core and tenne yeeres) after &s;o great conque&s;ts and plan|tings of the Spaniardes and Por|tingales there, that wee of Eng|lande could neuer haue the grace to &s;et fa&s;t footing in &s;uch fer|till and temperate places, as are left as yet vnpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them. But againe when I con&s;ider that there is a time for all men, and &s;ee the Portingales time to be out of date, &amp; that the nakedne&s;&s;e of the &s;paniards, and their long hidden &s;ecretes are nowe at length e&s;pied, whereby they went about to delude the worlde, I conceiue great hope, that the time approcheth and nowe is, that we of England may &s;hare and part &s;takes (if wee will our &s;elues) both with the &s;paniarde and the Portingale in part of America, and other regions as yet vndi&s;couered. And &s;urely if there were in vs that de&s;ire to aduaunce the honour of our Countrie which ought to bee in euery good man, wee woulde not all this while haue fore|&s;lowne the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing of tho&s;e landes, whiche of equitie and right appertaine vnto vs, as by the di&s;cour&s;es that followe &s;hall appeare mo&s;t plainely. Yea if wee woulde beholde with the eye of pitie howe al our Pri&s;ons are pe&s;tered and filled with able men to &s;erue their Countrie, which for &s;mall roberies are dayly hanged vp in great numbers euen twentie at a clappe out of one iayle (as was &s;eene at the la&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;es at Roche&s;ter) wee woulde ha&s;ten and further euery man to his power the deduc|ting of &s;ome Colonies of our &s;uperfluous people into tho&s;e tem|perate and fertile partes of America, which being within &s;ixe
<PB REF="4"> weekes &s;ayling of England are yet vnpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any Chri&s;tians: and &s;eeme to offer them&s;elues vnto vs, &s;tretching neerer vnto her Maie&s;ties Dominions, then to any other part of Europe. Wee reade that the Bees, whe~ they grow to be too many in their own hiues at home, are wont to bee led out by their Captaines to &s;warme abroad, and &s;eeke them&s;elues a new dwelling place. If the examples of the Grecians and Carthaginians of olde time, and the practi&s;e of our age may not mooue vs, yet let vs learne wi&s;dome of the&s;e &s;mal weake and vnrea&s;onable creatures. It chaunced very lately that vpon occa&s;ion I had great conference in matters of Co&s;mographie with an excellent learned man of Portingale, mo&s;t priuie to all the di&s;coueries of his nation, who wondered that tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed countries, from the point of Flori|da Northward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;peech of a learned Portin|gale.</NOTE> were all this while vnplanted by Chri&s;tians, pro|te&s;ting with great affection and zeale, that if hee were nowe as young as I (for at this pre&s;ent hee is three&s;core yeeres of age) hee woulde &s;el all hee had, being a man of no &s;mall wealth and ho|nour, to furni&s;h a conuenient number of &s;hips to &s;ea for the in|habiting of tho&s;e countries, and reducing tho&s;e gentile people to chri&s;tianitie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;ter Iohn Barros the cau&s;er of the in|habiting of Bre&s;ilia.</NOTE> Moreouer hee added that Iohn Barros their chiefe Co&s;mographer being moued with the like de&s;ire, was the cau&s;e that Bre&s;ilia was fir&s;t inhabited by the Portingales: where they haue nine baronies or lord&s;hips, &amp; thirtie engennies or &s;u|ger milles, two or three hundred &s;laues belonging to eche myll, with a Iudge, and other officers, &amp; a Church: &s;o that euery mill is as it were a little common wealth: and that the countrie was fir&s;t planted by &s;uch men, as for &s;mall offences were &s;aued from the rope. This hee &s;pake not onely vnto mee and in my hearing, but al&s;o in the pre&s;ence of a friend of mine, a man of great &s;kill in the Mathematikes. If this mans de&s;ire might bee executed, wee might not only for the pre&s;ent time take po&s;&s;e&s;sion of that good land, but al&s;o in &s;hort &s;pace by Gods grace finde out that &s;horte and ea&s;ie pa&s;&s;age by the Northwe&s;t, which we haue hetherto &s;o long de&s;ired, and whereof wee haue many good and more then probable coniectures: a fewe whereof I thinke it not ami&s;&s;e heere to &s;et downe, although your wor&s;hip knowe them as
<PB REF="4"> well as my &s;elfe. Fir&s;t therefore it is not to bee forgotten, that Se|ba&s;tian Gabot wrote to ma&s;ter Bapti&s;ta Ramu&s;ius, that he very|ly beleeued that all the North part of America is diuided into I|landes. Secondly that ma&s;ter Iohn Verarzanus, which had been thri&s;e on that coa&s;t, in an olde excellent mappe, which he gaue to king Henrie the eight, and is yet in the cu&s;todie of ma&s;ter Locke, doth &s;o lay it out, as it is to bee &s;eene in the mappe annexed to the end of this boke, beeing made according to Verarzanus plat. Thirdly the &s;tory of Gil Gon&s;alua recorded by Franci&s;cus Lo|pes de Gomara, which is &s;aide to haue &s;ought a pa&s;&s;age by the North we&s;t, &s;eemeth to argue and proue the &s;ame. Fourthly, in the &s;econd relation of Iaques Cartier the 12. Chapter the peo|ple of Saguinay doe te&s;tifie that vpon their coa&s;tes We&s;twarde there is a &s;ea the ende whereof is vnknowne vnto them. Fiftly, in the end of that di&s;cour&s;e is added this, as a &s;pecial remem|brance, to wit, that they of Canada &s;ay that it is a monethes &s;pace to &s;aile to a lande where cinamon and cloues are growing. Sixtly, the people of Florida &s;ignified vnto Iohn Ribault (as it is expre&s;&s;ed in his di&s;cour&s;e heerewithall imprinted) that they might &s;aile from the Riuer of May vnto Ceuola and the &s;outh &s;ea through their countrie within twentie dayes. Seuenthly, the experience of captaine. Frobi&s;her on the hyther &s;ide, and Sir Fraunces Drake on the backe &s;ide of America, with the te&s;timo|nie of Nicolaus and Anthonius Zeni, that E&s;totilanda is an I|lande, doth yeelde no &s;mall hope thereof. La&s;tly, the iudge|ment of the excellent Geographer Gerardus Mercator, which his &s;onne Rumold Mercator my friende &s;hewed mee in his letters, &amp; drewe out for mee in writing, is not of wi&s;e men lightly to bee regarded. His words are the&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The iudgement of Gerardus Mercator of a pa&s;&s;age by the Northwe&s;t.</NOTE> <HI>Magna tamet&s;i pauca de noua Frobi&s;heri nauigatione &s;cribis, quam miror ante multos annos no~ fui&s;&s;e attentatam. Non enim dubium e&s;t, quin recta &amp; bre|uis via pateat in occidentem Cathaium v&s;&abque;. In quod regnu~, &s;i recte nauigationem in&s;tituant, nobili&s;simas totius mundi merces colligent, &amp; multis Gentibus adhuc idololatris Chri&s;ti nomen communicabunt.</HI> You write (&s;aith hee to his &s;onne) great matters though very briefly of the newe di&s;couerie
<PB REF="5"> of Frobi&s;her, which I wonder was neuer the&s;e many yeeres heeretofore attempted. For there is no doubt, but that there is a &s;traight and &s;hort way open into the We&s;t euen vnto Ca|thay. Into which kingdome, if they take their cour&s;e aright, they &s;hall gather the mo&s;t noble merchandi&s;e of all the worlde, and &s;hall make the name of Chri&s;te to bee knowne vnto many idolatrous and Heathen people. And heere to conclude and &s;hut vp this matter, I haue hearde my &s;elfe of Merchants of cre|dite that haue liued long in Spaine, that King Phillip hath made a lawe of late that none of his &s;ubiectes &s;hall di&s;couer to the Northwardes of fiue and fortie degrees of America:<NOTE PLACE="marg">A lawe made of late by king. Phillip.</NOTE> whiche may bee thought to proceede chiefly of two cau&s;es, the one, lea&s;t pa&s;sing farther to the North they &s;hould di&s;couer the open pa&s;&s;age from the &s;outh &s;ea to our north &s;ea: the other becau&s;e they haue not people enough to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e and keepe that pa&s;&s;age, but rather thereby &s;houlde open a gappe for other nations to pa&s;&s;e that way. Certes if hetherto in our owne di&s;coueries we had not beene led with a prepo&s;terous de&s;ire of &s;eeking ra|ther gaine then Gods glorie, I a&s;&s;ure my &s;elf that our labours had taken farre better effecte. But wee forgotte, that Godline&s;&s;e is great riches, and that if we fir&s;t &s;eeke the kingdome of God, al o|ther thinges will be giuen vnto vs, and that as the light accompa|nieth the Sunne, and the heate the fire, &s;o la&s;ting riches do waite vpon them that are zealous for the aduauncement of the king|dome of Chri&s;t, and the enlargement of his glorious Go&s;pell: as it is &s;ayde, I will honour them that honour mee. I tru&s;te that nowe being taught by their manifolde lo&s;&s;es our men will take a more godly cour&s;e, and v&s;e &s;ome part of their goods to his glo|rie: if not, he will turne euen their couetou&s;nes to &s;erue him, as he hath done the pride and auarice of the Spaniardes and Por|tingales, who pretending in glorious words that they made their di&s;coueries chiefly to conuert Infidelles to our mo&s;t holy faith, (as they &s;ay) in deed and truth &s;ought not them, but their goods and riches. Whiche thing that our nation may more &s;peedily &amp; happily performe, there is no better meane in my &s;imple iudge me~t then the increa&s;e of knowledge in the arte of nauigation, &amp;
<PB REF="5"> breading of &s;kilfulne&s;&s;e in the &s;ea men: whiche Charles the Em|perour and the king of Spaine that nowe is wi&s;ely con&s;idering haue in their Contractation hou&s;e in Siuill<NOTE PLACE="marg">The co~tractatio~ hou&s;e at Siuill.</NOTE> appointed a learned reader of the &s;ayde art of Nauigation, and ioyned with him cer|tayne examiners, and haue di&s;tingui&s;hed the orders among the &s;ea men, as the groomet whiche is the ba&s;e&s;t degree, the mar|riner which is the &s;econde, the ma&s;ter the thirde, and the pilote the fourth, vnto the which two la&s;t degrees none is admitted without hee haue heard the reader for a certaine &s;pace (which is commonly an excellent Mathematician, of which number were Pedro di Medina which writte learnedly of the art of nauigation, and Alon&s;o di Chauez &amp; Hieronimus di Chauez, who&s;e works likewi&s;e I haue &s;eene) and being founde fitte by him and his a&s;|&s;i&s;tantes, which are to examine matters touching experience, they are admitted with as great &s;olemnitie and giuing of pre&s;ents to the ancient ma&s;ters and Pilots, and the reader and examiners, as the great doctors in the Vniuer&s;ities, or our great Sergeantes at the law when they proceed, and &s;o are admitted to take charge for the Indies. And that your wor&s;hippe may knowe that this is true, Ma&s;ter Steuen Borrows,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. Steuen Borrowes.</NOTE> nowe one of the foure ma&s;ters of the Queenes nauie, tolde me that newely after his returne from the di&s;couery of Mo&s;couie by the North, in Queene Maries daies, the Spaniards, hauing intelligence that he was ma&s;ter in that di&s;|couerie, tooke him into their co~tractation hou&s;e at their making and admitting of ma&s;ters and pilots, giuing him great honour, &amp; pre&s;ented him with a payre of perfumed gloues woorth fiue or &s;ixe Ducates. I &s;peake all this to this ende, that the like order of erecting &s;uch a Lecture<NOTE PLACE="marg">A lecture of the art of nauigatio~ nece&s;&s;arie for to be erected in London.</NOTE> here in London or about Ratcliffe in &s;ome conuenient place, were a matter of great con&s;equence and importance, for the &s;auing of many mens liues and goods, which nowe through gro&s;&s;e ignorance are dayly in great hazerd, to the no &s;mall detriment of the whole realme. For whiche cau&s;e I haue dealt with the right wor&s;hipfull &s;ir Frances Drake, that &s;ee|ing God hath ble&s;&s;ed him &s;o wonderfully, he woulde do this hon+nour to him &s;elfe and benefite to his countrey, to bee at the co&s;t to erecte &s;uch a lecture: Whereunto in mo&s;t bountifull maner
<PB REF="6"> at the verie fir&s;t he an&s;wered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bountiful offer of &s;ir Fra~|cis Drake to|ward furthering the art of Naui|gation.</NOTE> that he liked &s;o well of the motion, that he woulde giue twentie poundes by the yeere &s;tanding, and twentie poundes more before hand to a learned man to furni&s;h him with in&s;truments and maps, that woulde take this thing vp|on him: yea &s;o readie he was that he earne&s;tly reque&s;ted mee to helpe him to the notice of a fitte man for that purpo&s;e, which I, for the zeale I bare to this good actio~, did pre&s;ently, &amp; brought him one, who came vnto him &amp; conferred with him thereupon: but in fine he would not vndertake the lecture, vnle&s;&s;e he might haue fourtie pounde a yeere &s;tanding, and &s;o the matter cea&s;ed for that time: howebeit the worthie and good Knight remaineth full con&s;tant, and will be, as he told me very lately, as good as his worde. Nowe if God &s;houlde put into the head of any noble man to contribute other twentie pounde, to make this lecture a competent liuing for a learned man, the whole realme no doubt might reape no &s;mall benefite thereby. To leaue this matter &amp; to drawe to an ende, I haue heare right wor&s;hipfull in this ha&s;tie worke fir&s;t put downe the title which we haue to that part of A|merica which is from Florida to 67. degrees northwarde, by the letters patentes graunted to Iohn Gabote and his three &s;onnes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ihon Gabote and his three &s;onnes.</NOTE> Lewes, Seba&s;tian, and Santius, with Seba&s;tians owne Certificate to Bapti&s;ta Ramu&s;ius of his di&s;couerie of America, and the te&s;ti|monie of Fabian our own Chronicler. Next I haue cau&s;ed to bee added the letters of M.

MOST EXCELLENT PRINCE.</HEAD>
<P>_EXperience proueth that natural|ly all Princes bee de&s;irous to ex|tend and enlarge their domini|ons and kingdomes. Wherfore it is not to bee maruelled, to &s;ee them euery day procure y^e &s;ame, not regarding any co&s;t, perill, and labour, that may thereby chaunce, but rather it is to bee marueiled, if there be any prince content to liue quiet with his owne dominions. For &s;ure|ly the people would thinke he lacketh the noble courage and &s;pirit of all other. The worlde knoweth that the de&s;ires of Princes haue beene &s;o feruent to obtaine their purpo&s;e, that they haue aduentured and proued things to mans con|iecture impo&s;&s;ible, the which they haue made po&s;&s;ible, and al|&s;o things difficult haue made facil, and thus to obtaine their purpo&s;e haue in maner turned vp and downe the whole worlde &s;o many times, that the people inhabiting in the far|the&s;t regio~ of the occident haue pur&s;ued with great de&s;ires, labours and perils, to penetrate and enter into the farthe&s;t regions of the Orient: And in likewi&s;e tho&s;e people of the &s;aid partes of the Orient haue had no le&s;&s;e labour and de&s;ire to enter and penetrate into the farthe&s;t land of the Occident, and &s;o following their purcha&s;e haue not &s;ea&s;ed vntill they
<PB REF="12"> could pa&s;&s;e no farther by rea&s;on of the great Seas. This naturall inclination is cau&s;e, that &s;car&s;ely it may bee &s;aide there is any kingdome &s;table, nor king quiet, but that his owne imagination, or other Princes his neighbours doe trouble him. God and nature hath prouided to your Grace, and to your Gracious progenitors this Realme of Eng|lande, and &s;et it in &s;o fruitefull a place, and within &s;uche li|mites, that it &s;houlde &s;eeme to bee a place quiet and aparted from all the fore&s;aide de&s;ires. One &s;peciall cau&s;e is, for that it is compa&s;&s;ed with the Sea: by rea&s;on thereof it &s;eemes, this notwith&s;tanding, their de&s;ires and noble cou|rages haue been mo&s;t commonly like vnto others: and with marueilous great labours, co&s;tes and perilles, they haue tra|uelled and pa&s;&s;ed the Seas making warre not onely with kings and dominions nigh neighbours, but al&s;o with them of farre countries, and &s;o hath wonne and conquered many riche and faire Dominions, and amplifted this your Graces Realme with great victorie and glory. And al&s;o nowe of late your Grace hauing like courage and de&s;ire, &amp; not with|out iu&s;t cau&s;e, to enlarge this your kingdome and demaund your limites and tribute of the French king, which at that pre&s;ent hee re&s;trained your Grace in per&s;on pa&s;&s;ed with a great power into France, putting your Graces per&s;on to great paine and labour, and without doubt victoriou&s;ly you had conquered the &s;aide Realme of Fraunce, as yee began; if your aduer&s;arie had not reconciled him, and knowledged your Graces right and title: and &s;o promi&s;ed truely to pay the tribute then due, and fulfill your reque&s;t in all thinges, and al&s;o de&s;ired your Grace for peace, the which of your cle|mencie you could not refu&s;e.</P>
<P>Nowe I con&s;idering this your noble courage and de&s;ire, &amp; al&s;o perceiuing that your Grace may at your plea|&s;ure, to your greater glory, by a godly meane, with litle co&s;t, perill, or labour to your Grace or any of your Subiectes, amplifie and inriche this your &s;aide Realme, I knowe it is my bounde dutie to manife&s;t this &s;ecrete vnto your Grace,
<PB REF="12"> which hitherto as I &s;uppo&s;e hath beene hid:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> which is that with a &s;mall number of &s;hippes there may bee di&s;couered diuers newe landes and kingdomes, in the whiche without doubt your Grace &s;hall winne perpetuall glory and your Subiects infinite profite. To which places there is left one way to di&s;couer, which is into the North: For that of the foure parts of the worlde it &s;eemeth three partes are di&s;couered by other Princes. For out of Spaine they haue di&s;couered all the Indies and Seas Occidentall, and out of Portugale all the Indies and Seas Oriental: So that by this part of the Orient and Occident, they haue compa&s;&s;ed the worlde. For the one of them departing to|warde the Orient, and the other towarde the Occident, met againe in the cour&s;e or way of the midde&s;t of the day, and &s;o then was di&s;couered a great part of the &s;ame Seas and coa&s;tes by the Spaniardes. So that nowe re&s;t to bee di&s;|couered the &s;aide North partes, the which it &s;eemeth to mee, is onely your charge and duetie. Becau&s;e the &s;i|tuation of this your Realme is thereunto neere&s;t and ap|te&s;t of all other:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> and al&s;o for that you haue alreadie taken it in hande: And in mine opinion, it will not &s;eeme well to leaue &s;o great and profitable an enterpri&s;e, &s;eeing it may &s;o ea&s;ily and with &s;o little co&s;te, labour, and daunger, bee followed and obteined: Though heeretofore your Grace hath made theereof a proofe, and founde not the commoditie thereby as you tru&s;ted, at this time it &s;hall bee no impediment. For there may bee nowe prouided remedies for thinges, then lacked, and the inconuenien|ces and lettes remooued that then were cau&s;e your Gra|ces de&s;ire tooke no full effect, which is, the cour&s;es to be chaunged, and followe the afore&s;aid new cour&s;es. And con|cerning the marriners, &s;hippes, and proui&s;ion, an order may be deui&s;ed and taken meete and conuenient much better then hetherto.

For they being pa&s;t this little way which they named &s;o dangerous, which may bee ii, or iii. leagues before they come to y^e Pole, and as much more after they pa&s;&s;e the Pole, it is cleere that from thence foorth the Seas and landes are as temperat as in the&s;e partes, &amp; that then it may be at the will and plea|&s;ure of the marriners, to choo&s;e whether they will &s;aile by y^e

For &s;uch things haue ofte~ times happened in this coun|trey.</P>
<P>Al&s;o to write to your Lord&s;hippe of the newe trade of &s;picerie of the Emperour, there is no doubt but that the I|landes are fertile of cloues, nutmegs, mace, and cinnamon: And that the &s;aide Ilandes, with other there about, abounde w^t gold, Rubies, Diamonds, Bala&s;&s;es, Granates, iacincts &amp; other &s;tones &amp; pearles, as al other la~ds, that are vnder &amp; nere y^e equinoctial. For we &s;ee, where nature giueth any thing, &s;he is no nigarde. For as with vs and other, that are aparted from the &s;ayde equinoctiall, our mettalles be lead, tynne, and yron, &s;o theirs be golde, &s;iluer, and copper. And as our fruites and graines be aples, nuttes, and corne, &s;o theirs bee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ates, nutmegges, pepper, cloues, and other &s;pices. And as
<PB REF="14"> wee haue iette, amber, cri&s;tall, ia&s;per, and other like &s;tones, &s;o haue they rubies, diamonds, bala&s;&s;es, &s;aphires, Iacincts, and other like. And though &s;ome &s;ay that of &s;uch precious mettals, graines or kind of &s;pices, and precious &s;tones, the a|boundance and quantitie is nothing &s;o great, as our mettals, fruites or &s;tones aboue rehear&s;ed: yet if it be well con&s;idered, how the quantitie of the earth vnder the equinoctiall to both the tropicall lines, (in which &s;pace is founde the &s;aid golde, &s;pices and precious &s;tones) to be as much in quantitie, as al|mo&s;t all the earth from the tropickes to both the poles: it can not be denied but there is more quantitie of the &s;aid mettels, fruites, &s;pices, and precious &s;tones, then there is of the other mettels and other thinges before rehear&s;ed. And I &s;ee that the preciou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the&s;e thinges is mea&s;ured after the di&s;tance that is betweene vs, and the things that we haue ap|petite vnto. For in this nauigation of the &s;picerie was di&s;co|uered, that the&s;e Ilandes nothing &s;et by golde, but &s;et more by a knife and a nayle of yron, then by his quantitie of Golde: and with rea&s;on, as the thing more nece&s;&s;arie for mans &s;er|uice. And I doubt not but to them &s;houlde bee as precious our corne and &s;eedes, if they might haue them, as to vs their &s;pices: and likewi&s;e the peeces of gla&s;&s;e that heare wee haue counterfayted are as precious to them, as to vs their &s;tones: which by experience is &s;eene daylie by them that haue trade thither. This of the riches of tho&s;e countries is &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>Touching that your Lord&s;hip wrote, whether it may be profitable to the Emperour or no, it may be without doubte of great profit: if as the king of Portingall doth, he woulde become a marchant, and prouide &s;hippes and their lading, and trade thither alone, and defende the trade of the&s;e Ilands for him&s;elfe. But other greater bu&s;ines withholdeth him from this. But &s;till, as nowe it is begunne to bee occupied, it would come to much.

<P>Fir&s;t, your Lord&s;hip knoweth that the Co&s;mographers haue deuided the earth by <HI>360.</HI> degrees in latitude, and as many in longitude, vnder the which is comprehended al the roundne&s;&s;e of the earth: the latitude beeing deuided into <HI>4.</HI> quarters, ninetie degrees amount to euerie quarter, which they mea&s;ure by the altitude of the poles, that is the North and South &s;tarres, beeing from the line equinoctiall till they come right vnder the Noth &s;tarre the &s;aide ninetie de|grees: and a&s;muche from the &s;ayde line equinoctiall to the South &s;tarre bee other ninetie degrees.

And the longitude, in which are al&s;o counted other <HI>360.</HI> is counted fro~ We&s;t to Ea&s;t, or from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, as in the card is &s;et. The &s;aid latitude your Lord&s;hip may &s;ee marked and deuided in the end of this carde on the left hande.<NOTE PLACE="marg">To know the latitudes.</NOTE> So that if you woulde know in what degrees of latitude any region or coa&s;t &s;tan|deth, take a compa&s;&s;e and &s;et the one foote of the &s;ame in the equinoctiall line right again&s;t the &s;aid region, and apply the other foote of the compa&s;&s;e to the &s;aide region or coa&s;t, and then &s;et the &s;ayd compa&s;&s;e at the ende of the carde, where the degrees are deuided.

And that whiche is without the two &s;ayde tran&s;uer&s;all lynes is onely to &s;hew howe the Oriental part is ioyned with the Occident, &amp; Occident with the Orient. For that that is &s;et without the line in the Ori|ent parte, is the &s;ame that is &s;et within the other line in the Occidentall parte: and againe that that is &s;ette without the line in the Occidentall part, is the &s;ame that is &s;et with|in the line on the Orientall parte: To &s;hewe that though this figure of the worlde in playne or flat &s;eemeth to haue an ende, yet one imagining that this &s;ayde carde were &s;et vpon a round thing, where the endes &s;houlde touche by the lines, it would plainely appeare howe the Orient part ioy|neth with the Occident, as there without the lines it is de|&s;cribed &amp; figured. And for more declaration of the &s;aid card, your Lord&s;hip &s;hall vnder&s;tand, that beginning on the parte Occidentall within the lyne, the fir&s;t land that is &s;et out, is y^e mayne land &amp; Iland of the Indies of y^e Emperour.

The
<PB REF="16"> &s;ayd coa&s;t from the &s;aide Indies Southwarde, as by the carde your Lord&s;hippe may &s;ee, co~meth to a certaine &s;traite &s;ea called <HI>E&s;trecho de todos Sanctos:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Now called the &s;treit of Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">|lane.</NOTE> by which &s;traite Sea the Spaniardes goe to the &s;piceries, as I &s;hall declare more at large: the which &s;traite &s;ea is right again&s;t the three hundred fifteene degrees of Longitude, and is of Latitude or altitude from the Equinoctiall fiftie three de|grees. The fir&s;t lande from the &s;ayd beginning of the carde towarde the Orient is certaine Ilandes of the Canaries &amp; Ilandes of <HI>Capo verde.</HI> But the fir&s;t mayne lande next to the line Equinoctiall is the &s;ayde <HI>Capo verde,</HI> and from thence northwarde by the &s;treite of this &s;ea of Italie. And &s;o followeth Spayne, Fraunce, Flaunders, Almaine, Denmarke and Norway, which is the highe&s;t parte tow|ard the North. And ouer again&s;t Flaunders are our Ilands of England and Irelande. Of the landes and coa&s;tes with|in the &s;traites I haue &s;et out onelye the Regions, deui|ding them by lynes of their lymittes, by whiche playnelie I thinke your Lord&s;hip may &s;ee, in what &s;ituatio~ euery re|gion is, and of what highne&s;&s;e, &amp; with what regions it is ioy|ned. I doe thinke few are lefte out of all Europe. In the partes of A&s;ia and Affrica I could not &s;o well make the &s;aid diui&s;ions: for that they be not &s;o well knowen, nor neede not &s;o muche. This I write becau&s;e in the &s;ayde carde bee made the &s;ayde lynes and &s;trikes, that your Lord&s;hippe &s;hould vnder&s;tande wherefore they doe &s;erue. Al&s;o returning to fore&s;ayde <HI>Capo verde</HI> the coa&s;t goeth Southwarde to a cape called <HI>Capo de bona &s;peran&s;a:</HI> which is right ouer agayn&s;t the &s;ixtye and &s;ixtie fifte degree of Longitude. And by this cape goe the Portingales to their &s;picerie. For from this cape towarde the Orient, is the Lande of <HI>Calicut,</HI> as your Lord&s;hippe may &s;ee in the head lande o|uer again&s;t the <HI>130.</HI> degree. From the &s;aid cape of <HI>Bona Spe|ransa</HI> the coa&s;t returneth toward the line Equinoctiall, and pa&s;&s;ing foorth entreth the read &s;ea, &amp; returning out entreth againe into the gulfe of Per&s;ia, and returneth towarde the Equinoctiall line, till that it commeth to the head|land
<PB REF="17"> called Callicut afore &s;aide, and from thence the coa&s;t making a Gulfe, where is the riuer of Ganges, returneth towarde the line to a head lande called Malacha, where is the principall &s;picerie: And from this cape returneth and maketh a great gulfe, and after the coa&s;t goeth right toward the Orient, and ouer again&s;t this la&s;t gulfe and coa&s;t be ma|nie Ilandes, which be Ilandes of the &s;piceries of the Empe|rour. Vpon which the Portingales and he be at vartaunce. The &s;aid coa&s;t goeth towarde the Orient, and endeth right again&s;t the <HI>155.</HI> degrees, and after returneth toward the oc|cident Northwarde: which coa&s;t not yet plainely knowne I may ioyn to the new found land found by vs, that I &s;pake of before. So that I fini&s;he with this a briefe declarati|on of the carde afore&s;ayde. Well I knowe I &s;houlde al&s;o haue declared how the coa&s;tes within the &s;treites of the Sea of Italie runne. It is plaine that pa&s;&s;ing the &s;treites on the North&s;ide of that Sea after the coa&s;t of Granado, and with that which pertaynes to Spayne, is the coa&s;t of that which Fraunce hath in Italie. And then followeth in one peece all Italie, which lande hath an arme of a &s;ea with a gulfe which is called <HI>Mare Adriaticum.</HI> And in the bottome of this gulfe is the citie of Venice. And on the other part of the &s;aid gulfe is Sclauonia, and nexte Grecia, then the &s;treites of Con&s;tantinople, and then the Sea called <HI>Euximus,</HI> which is within the &s;aide &s;treites: And com|ming out of the &s;aid &s;traits floweth toward Turcia ma|ior. (Though now on both &s;ides it is called Turcia.) And &s;o the coa&s;t runneth Southward to Syria, and ouer again&s;t the &s;aid Turcia are the Ila~des of Rhodes, Candie, and Cy|prus. And ouer again&s;t Italie are the Ilandes of Sicilia &amp; Sardinia. And ouer again&s;t Spaine is Maiorca and minor|ca. In the ende of the gulfe of Syria is Iudea. And from thence returneth the coa&s;t toward the Occident, till it com|meth to the &s;treites where wee beganne, whiche all is the coa&s;t of Affricke or Barbarie. Al&s;o your Lord&s;hippe &s;hall vnder&s;tande that the coa&s;tes of the Sea throughout all the world I haue coloured with yellow; for that it may appeare
<PB REF="17"> that all that is within the line coloured yellow, is to be ima|gined to be mayne land or Iland: and all without the &s;ayde line &s;o coloured to bee Sea: whereby it is ea&s;ie and light to know it. Albeit in this little roome any other de&s;cription would rather haue made it ob&s;cure then cleere. Al&s;o the &s;ayd coa&s;ts of the Sea are all &s;et iu&s;tly after the manner &amp; forme as they lye, as the nauigation approoueth the~ throughout all the carde, &s;aue onely the coa&s;tes and Iles of the &s;picerie of y^e Emperour which is from ouer again&s;t the <HI>160.</HI> to the <HI>215.</HI> degrees of Longitude. For the&s;e coa&s;tes &amp; &s;ituations of the Ilands euery of the Co&s;inographers and pilots of Portin|gall and Spayne doe &s;et after their purpo&s;e. The Spani|ards more towards the Orient, becau&s;e they &s;hould appeare to appertaine to the Emperour: and the Portingalles more toward the Occident, for that they &s;hould fall within their iuri&s;diction. So that the Pilots &amp; nauigants thither, which in &s;uch ca&s;es &s;hould declare y^e truth, by their indu&s;trie doe &s;et the~ fal&s;ely euery one to fauour his prince. And for this cau&s;e can be no certaine &s;ituatio~ of y^e coa&s;t &amp; Ilands, til this diffe|rence betwixte them be verified. Nowe to come to the purpo&s;e of your Lord&s;hippes demaunde touching the diffe|rence betweene the Emperour and the king of Portingall, to vnder&s;ta~d it better, I mu&s;t declare y^e beginning of this di&s;|couering. Though peradue~ture your Lord&s;hip may &s;ay y^t in that I haue writte~ ought of purpo&s;e I fall in the Prouerbe, <HI>A gemino ouo bellum:</HI> But your Lord&s;hip commaunded me to be large, &amp; I take licence to be prolixou&s;e, &amp; &s;halbe perad|uenture tedious, but your Lord&s;hip knoweth that <HI>nihil igno|rantia verbo&s;ius.</HI> In the yeere <HI>1484.</HI> the king of Portingal minded to arme certaine caruelles to di&s;couer this &s;picery. Then fora&s;much as he feared that being di&s;couered euerie other prince would &s;end &amp; trade thither, &s;o y^t the co&s;t &amp; peril of di&s;couering &s;hould be his, &amp; the profite common: where|fore fir&s;t he gaue knowledge of this his mynd to al princes chri&s;tened, &s;aying y^t he would &s;eeke amo~g&s;t y^e infidels newe po&s;&s;e&s;&s;io~s of regions, &amp; therfore would make a certain army: &amp; y^t if any of the~ would help in y^e co&s;t of y^e &s;aid army he &s;hould
<PB REF="18"> enioy his parte of the profite or honour that &s;houlde come of it. And as then this di&s;couering was holden for a &s;traunge thing and vncertaine. Nowe they &s;ay, that all the Princes of Chri&s;tendome aun&s;weared that they woulde bee no part of &s;uch an army, nor yet of the profite y^t might come of it. After the which he gaue knowledge to the Pope of his purpo&s;e, &amp; of the an&s;were of all the Princes, de&s;iring him y^t &s;eeing that none would helpe in the co&s;tes, that hee woulde iudge all that &s;houlde bee founde and di&s;couered to be of his iuri&s;diction, and commaund that none other Princes &s;hould intermeddle therewith. The Pope &s;aide not as Chri&s;t &s;aith, <HI>Quis me con&s;tituit iudicem inter vos?</HI> He did not refu&s;e, but making him &s;elfe as Lorde and Iudge of all, not only grau~|ted that all that &s;hould be di&s;couered from Orie~t to Occide~t &s;hould be the kings of Portingall, but al&s;o, that vpon great cen&s;ures no other Prince &s;hould di&s;couer but he: And if they did, all to be the kinges of Portingall. So he armed a fleete, and in the yeere <HI>1487.</HI> was di&s;couered y^t Ilands of <HI>Calicut,</HI> from whence is brought all the &s;pice he hath. After this in the yeere <HI>1492.</HI> the king of Spaine willing to di&s;couer landes towarde the Occident without making any &s;uch di|ligence, or taking licence of the king of Portingale, armed certayne caruelles, and then di&s;couered this India Occiden|tall, e&s;pecially two Ilandes of the &s;aide India, that in this carde I &s;et foorth named the one <HI>Ladominica,</HI> and the other <HI>Cuba,</HI> and brought certaine gold from thence. Of the which when the king of Portingall had knowledge, he &s;ent to the king of Spayne, requiring him to giue him y^e &s;aid Ilands. For that by the &s;entence of the Pope all that &s;hould be di&s;co|uered was his, and that he &s;hould not proceede further in the di&s;couerie without his licence. And at the &s;ame time it &s;ee|meth that out of <HI>Ca&s;till,</HI> into Portingale had gone for feare of burning infinite number of Iewes that were expelled out of Spayne, for that they would not turne to be Chri&s;tians, &amp; carried with the~ infinite number of gold &amp; &s;iluer. So that it &s;eemeth that the king of Spayne an&s;wered that it was rea&s;o~ that the king of Portingall a&s;ked, and that to bee obedient to
<PB REF="18"> that which the pope had decreed, he would giue him the &s;aid Ilands of the Indies. Now for as much as it was decreed betwixt y^e &s;aid kings, y^t none &s;hould receiue y^e others &s;ubiects fugitiues, nor their goodes, therefore the king of Portingale &s;hould pay and returne to the king of Spaine a million of Golde or more, that the Iewes had carried out of Spaine to Portingale; and that &s;o doing he would giue the&s;e Ilandes and de&s;i&s;t from any more di&s;couering. And not fulfilling this he would not onely not giue the&s;e Ilands, but procure to di&s;couer more where him thought be&s;t. It &s;eemeth that the king of Portingale would not or could not with his ea&s;e pay this mony. And &s;o not paying that he coulde not let the king of Spaine to di&s;couer: &s;o that hee enterpri&s;ed not to|ward the Orient where he had begun and found the &s;picery. And con&s;ented to the king of Spaine that touching this di&s;|couering they &s;hould deuide the worlde betweene them two. And that all that &s;hould be di&s;couered fro~ <HI>Capo verde,</HI> where this carde beginneth to be counted in the degrees of longi|tude, to <HI>180.</HI> of the &s;ayde &s;cale of longitude, which is halfe the worlde toward the Orient, and fini&s;heth in this carde right ouer again&s;t a little cro&s;&s;e made at the &s;ayde <HI>180.</HI> de|grees, to be the king of Portingalles. And all the lande from the &s;ayde Cro&s;&s;e towarde the Occident, vntill it ioyneth with the other Cro&s;&s;e in the Orient, which contei|neth the other hundreth and eightie degrees, that is the other halfe of the worlde, to bee the king of Spaynes. So that from the lande ouer agayn&s;t the &s;ayde hundreth and eightie degrees vntill it fini&s;h in the three hundred and &s;ixtie on both the endes of the carde, is the iuri&s;dicti|on of the king of Spayne. So after this manner they deuided the worlde betweene them. Nowe for that the&s;e Ilandes of &s;picerie fall neere the terme and lymites be|tweene the&s;e Princes (for as by the &s;ayde carde you maye &s;ee they beginne from one hundred and &s;ixtie degrees of Longitude, and ende in <HI>215.</HI>) it &s;eemeth all that falleth from <HI>160.</HI> to <HI>180.</HI> degrees, &s;houlde bee of Portingall:
<PB REF="19"> and all the re&s;t of Spayne. And for that their Co&s;mogra|phers and Pilots could not agree in the &s;ituation of the &s;aid Ilands (for the Portingals &s;et them al within their <HI>180.</HI> de|grees, and the Spaniards &s;et them all without: &amp; for that in mea&s;uring, all the Co&s;mographers of both partes, or what other that euer haue beene ca~not giue certaine order to mea&s;ure y^e lo~gitude of the world,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The longitudes harde to be founde out.</NOTE> as they do of y^e latitude: for y^t there is no &s;tarre fixed fro~ Ea&s;t to We&s;t, as are y^e &s;tarrs of the poles from North to South, but all mooueth with the mouing diuine:) no ma~ner can be found how certainely it may be mea&s;ured, but by coniectures, as the Nauigantes haue e&s;teemed the way they haue gone. But it is manife&s;t that Spayne had the &s;ituation of all the landes from <HI>Capo verde,</HI> towarde the Orient of the Portingales to their <HI>180.</HI> degrees. And in all their cardes they neuer hitherto &s;et the &s;ayd Ilands within their limitatio~ of the &s;ayd <HI>180.</HI> degrees: (Though they knew very well of the Ilandes,) til nowe that the Spaniards di&s;couered them. And it is knowne that the king of Portingale had trade to the&s;e Ilands afore, but would neuer &s;uffer Portingale to goe thither from <HI>Calicut:</HI> for &s;o much as hee knewe that it fell out of his dominion: lea&s;t by going thither there might come &s;ome knowledge of tho&s;e other Ilandes of the king of Spayne, but bought the cloues of Merchauntes of that countrie, that brought them to <HI>Calicut,</HI> much deerer then they would haue co&s;t, if he had &s;e~t for the~, thinking after this maner it would abide alwaies &s;ecrete. And now that it is di&s;couered he &s;endes and keepes the Spanierds from the trade all that he can. Al&s;o it &s;hould &s;ee me that when this fore&s;aide con&s;ent of the diui&s;ion of the worlde was agreed of betweene them, the king of Por|tingale had alreadye di&s;couered certayne Ilandes that lye ouer again&s;t <HI>Capo verde,</HI> and al&s;o certayne parte of the mayne lande of India towarde the South, from whence he fet Bra&s;ill, and called it the lande of Bra&s;ill. So for that all &s;houlde come in his terme and limites, bee tooke three hundred and &s;euentie leagues beyonde
<PB REF="19"> <HI>Capo verde:</HI> and after this, his <HI>180.</HI> degrees, being his part of the worlde, &s;houlde beginne in the Carde right ouer a|gain&s;t the <HI>340</HI> degrees, where I haue made a little com|pa&s;&s;e with a cro&s;&s;e, and &s;houlde fini&s;he at the <HI>160.</HI> degree, where al&s;o I haue made an other little marke. And after this computation without any controuer&s;ie, the Ilandes of the &s;picerie fall out of the Portingales domination. So that nowe the Spaniardes &s;ay to the Portingales that if they woulde beginne their <HI>180.</HI> degrees from the &s;aide <HI>Capo verde,</HI> to the intent they &s;houlde extende more towarde the o|riente, and &s;o to touche tho&s;e Ilandes of the &s;picerie of the Emperour, which is all that is betweene the two cro&s;&s;es made in this carde, that then the Ilandes of <HI>Capo verde</HI> and the lande of Bra&s;ill that the Portingales nowe obtaine, is out of the &s;ayde limitation, and that they are of the Empe|rours. Or if their <HI>180.</HI> degrees they count from the <HI>370.</HI> leagues beyonde the &s;ayde <HI>Capo verde,</HI> to include in it the &s;ayde Ilandes and landes of Bra&s;ill, then plainely appea|reth the &s;aide <HI>180.</HI> degrees &s;houlde fini&s;he longe before they come to the&s;e Ilandes of the &s;picerie of the Emperour: As by this Carde your Lorde&s;hippe may &s;ee. For their li|mittes &s;houlde beginne at the <HI>340.</HI> degrees, of this Carde, and ende at <HI>160.</HI> degrees, where I haue made two little marks of the compa&s;&s;e with cro&s;&s;es in them.</P>
<P>So that plainely it &s;houlde appeare by rea&s;on, that the Portingales &s;houlde leaue the&s;e Ilandes of <HI>Capo verde</HI> and land of Bra&s;ill, if they would haue part of the &s;picerie of the Emperours: or el&s;e holding the&s;e, they haue no parte there. To this the Portingales &s;ay, that they will beginne their <HI>180.</HI> degrees from the &s;elfe &s;ame <HI>Capo verde:</HI> for that it maye extende &s;o muche more towarde the oriente and touche the&s;e Ilandes of the Emperours: and woulde winne the&s;e Ilandes of <HI>Capo verde</HI> and lande of Bra&s;ill ne|uer the le&s;&s;e, as a thinge that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before the con|&s;ent of this limitation was made.</P>

<P>They bee not yet agreed, <HI>Quare &s;ub Iudice lis est.</HI> But without doubte by all coniectures of rea&s;on the &s;ayde Ilandes fall all without the limitation of Portingale, and pertayne to Spaine, as it appeareth by the mo&s;t parte of all the Cardes made by the Portingales, &s;aue tho&s;e they haue fal&s;ified of late purpo&s;ely. But nowe touching that your Lorde&s;hippe wrote, whether that which wee di&s;couered tou|cheth any thing the fore&s;ayde coa&s;tes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">New found la~d di&s;couered by the engli&s;hmen.</NOTE> once it appeareth plainely that the Newe founde lande that wee di&s;couered is all a mayne lande with the Indies occidentall, from whence the emperour hath all the golde and pearles: and &s;o continu|eth of coa&s;te more then <HI>5000.</HI> leagues of length, as by this Carde appeareth. For from the &s;aide newe landes it pro|ceedeth toward the occide~t to the Indies, and from the In|dies returneth toward the orient, &amp; after turneth &s;outhwarde vp till it come to the &s;traytes of Todos Sanctos, whiche I reckon to bee more then <HI>5000.</HI> leagues.</P>

The <HI>17</HI> of Ianuarie, the yeere <HI>1524.</HI> by the grace of God, wee departed from the di&s;habited Rocke, by the I&s;le of <HI>Mad&ecirc;ra,</HI> appertaining to the king of <HI>Portingall,</HI> with fiftie men, with victuals, weapon, and other &s;hip munition very well pro|uided and furni&s;hed for 8. monethes: And &s;ayling we&s;twards with a faire Ea&s;terly winde, in 25. dayes wee ranne 500. leagues, and the 20. of Februarie wee were ouertaken with as &s;harpe and terrible a tempe&s;t as euer any &s;aylers &s;uffe|red: whereof with y^e diuine helpe &amp; mercifull a&s;&s;i&s;taunce of Almightie God, and the goodne&s;&s;e of our &s;hip accompanied
<PB REF="24"> with the good hap of her fortunate name wee were deliue|red, and with a pro&s;perous wind followed our cour&s;e We&s;t &amp; by North. And in other 25. dayes wee made aboue 400. leagues more, where wee di&s;couered a newe land, neuer be|fore &s;eene of any man either auncient or moderne, and at the fir&s;t &s;ight it &s;eemed &s;omewhat lowe, but beeing within a quarter of a league of it, wee perceiued by the great fiers that wee &s;awe by the Sea coa&s;te that it was inhabited: and &s;aw that the lande &s;tretched to the Southwards: in &s;eeking &s;ome conuenient harborough whereby to come a lande, and haue knowledge of the place, wee &s;ayled fiftie leagues in vaine, and &s;eeing the lande to runn &s;till to the Southwards wee re&s;olued to returne backe againe towardes the North, where we found our &s;elues troubled with the like difficulty: at length beeing in de&s;paire to finde any port, wee ca&s;te anker vpon the coa&s;t, and &s;ent our Boate to &s;hore, where we &s;awe great &s;tore of people which came to the Sea &s;ide, and &s;eeing vs to approche they fled away, and &s;ometimes would &s;tande &s;till and looke backe, beholding vs with great admi|ration: but afterwardes beeing animated and a&s;&s;ured with &s;ignes that wee made them, &s;ome of them came harde to the Sea &s;ide &s;eeming to reioyce very muche at the &s;ight of vs, and marueiling greatly at our apparell, &s;hape and whitenes, &s;hewed vs by &s;undry &s;ignes where wee might mo&s;t commo|diou&s;ly come a land with our Boat, offering vs al&s;o of their victuals to eate. Nowe I will briefly declare to your Maie&s;tie their life and manners, as farre as wee coulde haue notice thereof: The&s;e people goe altogether naked except only that they couer their priuie partes with certaine &s;kinnes of bea&s;tes like vnto Marterns, which they fa&s;ten vnto a narrowe girdle made of gra&s;&s;e verye artificially wrought, hanged about with tailes of diuers other bea&s;tes, which rounde about their bodies hang dangling downe to their knees. Some of them weare garlandes of byrdes feathers. The people are of colour ru&s;&s;et, and not much vnlike the Saracens, their hayre blacke, thicke and
<PB REF="24"> not very long, which they tye togeather in a knot behinde &amp; weare it like a taile. They are wel featured in their limbs, of meane &s;tature and commonly &s;omewhat bigger then we, brode brea&s;ted, &s;trong armes, their legges and other partes of their bodies well fa&s;hioned, and they are di&s;figured in no|thing &s;auing that they haue &s;omewhat brode vi&s;ages, and yet not all of them: for wee &s;awe many of them well fauoured hauing blacke and great eyes, with a cheerefull and &s;tedie looke, not &s;trong of body yet &s;harpe witted, nymble and great runners, as farre as we coulde learne by experience, and in tho&s;e two la&s;t qualities they are like to the people of the Ea&s;t partes of the worlde, and e&s;pecially to them of the vttermo&s;t partes of <HI>China,</HI> wee coulde not learne of this people their manner of liuing, nor their particuler cu|&s;tomes by rea&s;on of y^e &s;hort abode we made on the &s;hore, our companie being but &s;mall, and our &s;hip ryding farre of in the Sea. And not farre from the&s;e we founde an other peo|ple, who&s;e liuing wee thinke to bee like vnto theirs, (as heereafter I will declare vnto your Maie&s;tie,) &s;hewing at this pre&s;ent the &s;ituation and nature of the fore&s;aide lande: The &s;hore is all couered with &s;mall &s;ande, and &s;o a&s;cendeth vpwardes for the &s;pace of fifteene foote ri&s;ing in forme of little hilles about fiftie paces broade. And &s;ayling forwards wee founde certaine &s;mall Riuers and armes of the Sea, that enter at certain creekes, wa&s;hing the &s;hore on both &s;ides as the coa&s;t lyeth. And beyonde this wee &s;awe the open Countrie ri&s;ing in height aboue the &s;andie &s;hore with many fayre fieldes and plaines, full of mightie great woods, &s;ome verie thicke and &s;ome thinne, repleni&s;hed with diuers &s;ortes of trees, as plea&s;aunt and delectable to beholde as is po&s;&s;ible to imagine. And your Maie&s;tie may not thinke that the&s;e are like the woodes of <HI>Hercinia</HI> or the wilde De|&s;ertes of <HI>Tartary,</HI> and the Northerne Coa&s;tes full of fruitele&s;&s;e trees: But full of Palme trees, Bay trees, and high Cypre&s;&s;e trees, and many other &s;ortes of trees vn|knowne in <HI>Europe,</HI> which yeeld mo&s;t &s;weete &s;auours farre from the &s;hore, the propertie whereof wee coulde not learne
<PB REF="25"> For the cau&s;e afore&s;aide, and not for any difficultie to pa&s;&s;e through the woods: Seeing they are not &s;o thicke but that a man may pa&s;&s;e through them. Neither doe wee thinke that they part taking of the Ea&s;t worlde rounde a|bout them are all to geather voide of drugs or &s;picerie, and other riche&s;&s;e of golde, &s;eeing the colour of the lande doth &s;o much argue it and the lande is full of many bea&s;tes, as Stags, Deare and Hares, and likewi&s;e of Lakes and Pooles of Fre&s;h water, with great plentie of foules, conue|nient for all kinde of plea&s;ant game. This lande is in la|titude 34.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gr. 34.</NOTE> D. with good and hol&s;ome ayre, temperate, betweene hot and colde, no vehement windes doe blowe in tho&s;e Regions, and tho&s;e that doe commonly raigne in tho&s;e Coa&s;tes, are the North We&s;t and We&s;t windes in the Sommer &s;ea&s;on, (in the beginning whereof wee were there) the &s;kie cleere and faire with very little raine: and if at any time the ayre bee cloudie and mi&s;tie with the Sowtherne winde immediately it is di&s;&s;olued and waxeth cleare and fayre agayne. The Sea is caulme, not boy|&s;terous, the waues gentle, and although all the &s;hore bee &s;omewhat lowe and with out harborough: yet it is not daungerous to the &s;aylers beeing free from rockes and deepe, &s;o that within foure or fiue foote of the &s;hore, there is twentie foote deepe of water without ebbe or flood, the depth &s;till increa&s;ing in &s;uch vniforme proportion. There is very good ryding at Sea: for any Ship beeing &s;haken in a tempe&s;t can neuer peri&s;he there by breaking of her ca|bles, which wee haue proued by experience. For in the be|ginning of March (as is v&s;uall in all Regions) beeing in the Sea oppre&s;&s;ed with Northerne windes and riding there, wee founde our anker broken before the earth fay|led or mooued at all. Wee departed from this place &s;till running a long the coa&s;te, which we found to trende towarde the Ea&s;t, and wee &s;aw euerie where verie great fi|ers, by rea&s;on of the multitude of the inhabitants. While we rode on that Coa&s;te partlie becau&s;e it had no harborough, and for that wee wanted water, wee &s;ent our Boat a &s;hore
<PB REF="25"> with 25. men: whereby rea&s;on of great and continual waues that beate again&s;t the &s;hore, being an open coa&s;t, without &s;uccour, none of our men coulde po&s;&s;ible goe a &s;hore without loo&s;ing our boate. We &s;awe there many people which came vnto the &s;hore, making diuers &s;ignes of friend&s;hip, and &s;hew|ing that they were content wee &s;houlde come a lande, and by trial we found the~ to be very courteous &amp; gentle as your ma|ie&s;tie &s;hal vnder&s;tand by the &s;ucce&s;&s;e.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Courteous and gentle people.</NOTE> To the intent we might &s;ende them of our thinges, which the Indians commonly de|&s;ier and e&s;teeme as &s;heetes of Paper, gla&s;&s;es, belles, and &s;uch like trifles: Wee &s;ent a young man one of our Marri|ners a &s;hore, who &s;wimming towards them, and being with|in 3. or 4. yeards off the &s;hore, not tru&s;ting them, ca&s;t the thinges vpon the &s;hore, &s;eeking afterwardes to returne, hee was with &s;uch violence of the waues beaten vpon the &s;hore, that he was &s;o brui&s;ed that hee lay there almo&s;t dead, whiche the Indians perceiuing, ranne to catche him, and drawing him out they carried him a little way of from the &s;ea: The young man perceiuing they caried him, beeing at the fir&s;t di&s;maide, began then greatly to feare and cried out pitiou&s;ly, likewi&s;e did the Indians which did accompanie him, going about to cheere him and giue him courage, and then &s;etting him on the grounde at the foote of a little hill again&s;t the &s;unne, beganne to beholde him with great admiration, mar|ueiling at the whitene&s;&s;e of his fle&s;he: And putting off his clothes they made him warme at a great fire, not without our great feare which remained in the boate, that they would haue ro&s;ted him at that fire and haue eaten him. The young man hauing recouered his &s;trength, and hauing &s;tayed a while with them, &s;hewed them by &s;ignes that hee was de&s;i|rous to returne to the &s;hippe: And they with great loue clap|ping him fa&s;t about with many embracings, accompanying him vnto the &s;ea, and to put him in more a&s;&s;urance, leauing him alone they went vnto a high grounde and &s;toode there, beholding him vntil he was entred into the boate.

<P>Departing from hence following the &s;hore which tren|ded &s;omewhat towarde the North in 50. leagues &s;pace, wee came to another lande which &s;hewed much more faire and full of woods, being very great, where we rode at Ancker, and that wee might haue &s;ome knowledge thereof, wee &s;ent 20. men a lande, which entred into the countrey about two leagues, and they founde that the people were fledde to the woods for feare, they &s;awe onely one olde woman with a young maide of 18. or 20. yeeres olde, which &s;eeing our com|panie hid them &s;elues in the gra&s;&s;e for feare, the olde woman caried two Infantes on her &s;houlders, and behinde her necke a childe of 8. yeeres olde: the yong woman was laden like|wi&s;e with as many: but when our men came vnto them, the women cryed out, the olde woman made &s;ignes that the men were fled vnto the woods, as &s;oone as they &s;awe vs to quiet them and to winne their fauour, our men gaue them &s;uche victuals as they had with them to eate, which the old woman receiued thankfully: but the yong woman di&s;dained them al, and threwe them di&s;dainefully on the grounde, they tooke a childe from the olde woman to bring into Fraunce, and go|ing about to take the young woman which was verye beaw|tifull &amp; of tal &s;tature, they could not po&s;&s;ibly for y^e great out|cries that &s;hee made bring her to the &s;ea, and e&s;pecially ha|uing great woods to pa&s;&s;e through, and being farre from the &s;hippe, wee purpo&s;ed to leaue her behinde bearing away the childe onely. We found tho&s;e folkes to bee more white than tho&s;e that we founde before, being clad with certaine leaues y^e hang on boughes of trees, which they &s;owe together with thredes of wilde hempe, their heads were tru&s;&s;ed vp after the &s;ame manner as the former were, their ordinarie foode is of pul&s;e, whereof they haue great &s;tore, differing in colour &amp; ta&s;te fro~ ours, of good &amp; pla&s;ant ta&s;te. Moreouer they liue by fi&s;hing &amp; fouling which they take with ginnes, and bowes made of hard wood the arrowes of Canes, being
<PB REF="26"> headed with the bones of fi&s;he and other bea&s;tes. The bea&s;tes in the&s;e parts are much wilder the~ in our <HI>Europe,</HI> by rea&s;on they are continually cha&s;ed and hunted. Wee &s;awe many of their boates made of one tree 20. foote long, and 4. foote broade, which are not made with Iron, or &s;tone, or any other kinde of metal, (becau&s;e that in all this countrie for the &s;pace of 200. leagues whiche we ranne, wee neuer &s;awe one &s;tone of any &s;ort): they help them&s;elues with fyre, burning &s;o much of the tree as is &s;ufficient for the hollowne&s;&s;e of the boate, the like they doe in making the &s;terne and the foreparte vntill it be fitte to &s;aile vpon the &s;ea. The lande is in &s;ituation, good|ne&s;&s;e and fairenes like the other: it hath woods like the other, thinne and full of diuers &s;ortes of trees: but not &s;o &s;weete be|cau&s;e the countrey is more northerly and cold.</P>
<P>Wee &s;awe in this Countrey many Vines growing na|turally, which growing vp take hold of the trees as they do in Lombardie, w^c if by hu&s;bandmen they were dre&s;&s;ed in good order, without all doubte they woulde yeelde excellent wines: for wee hauing oftentymes &s;eene the fruite there|of dried, whiche was &s;weete and plea&s;aunt, and not diffe|ring from ours. Wee doe thinke that they doe e&s;teeme the &s;ame, becau&s;e that in euery place where they growe, they take away the vnder braunches growing rounde about, that the fruite thereof may ripen the better.</P>
<P>We found al&s;o ro&s;es, violettes, lillies, and many &s;orts of herbes, and &s;weete and odoriferous flowers different from ours. We knewe not their dwellinges, becau&s;e they were farre vp in the lande, and wee iudge by manye &s;ignes that wee &s;awe, that they are of wood and of trees framed toge|ther.</P>
<P>Wee doe beleeue al&s;o by many coniectures and &s;ignes, that many of them &s;leeping in the fieldes, haue no other co|uer then the open &s;kye. Further knowledge haue wee not of them, we thinke y^t all the re&s;t who&s;e countreys we pa&s;&s;ed liue all after one manner, hauing our aboade three dayes in this cuntrey, riding on the coa&s;t for want of harboroughs, we
<PB REF="27"> concluded to departe from thence, trending along the &s;hore betweene the North and the Ea&s;t, &s;ayling onely in the day|time, &amp; riding at ancker by night in the &s;pace of 100. leagues &s;ayling, wee founde a very plea&s;ant place, &s;ituated among&s;t certaine litle &s;teepe hilles: from amidde&s;t the which hilles there ran down into the &s;ea a great &s;treame of water, which within the mouth was very deep, &amp; from y^e &s;ea to y^e mouth of &s;ame with the tyde which wee found to ri&s;e 8. foot, any great ve&s;&s;ell laden may pa&s;&s;e vp.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e wee rode at Ancker in a place well fen&s;ed from the winde, wee woulde not venture our &s;elues without knowledge of the place, and wee pa&s;&s;ed vp with our boate onely into the &s;ayde Riuer, and &s;awe the Countrey very wel peopled. The people are almo&s;t like vnto the others, and clad with the fethers of foules of diuers colours, they came to|wardes vs very cherefully, making great &s;howtes of admi|ration, &s;hewing vs where we might come to lande mo&s;t &s;afe|ly with our boate. We entred vp the &s;aid riuer into the lande about halfe a league, where it made a mo&s;t plea&s;ant lake a|bout 3. leagues in compa&s;&s;e: on the which they rowed from the one &s;ide to the other to the number of 30. of their &s;mall boates: wherein were many people whiche pa&s;&s;ed from one &s;hore to the other to come and &s;ee vs, and beholde vpon the &s;odaine (as it is wont to fall out in &s;ayling) a contrarie flawe of winde comming from the &s;ea, wee were enforced to re|turne to our Shippe, leauing this lande to our great di&s;|contentment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The plea&s;ant|nes and riches of the lande.</NOTE> for the great commoditie and plea&s;antne&s;&s;e thereof whiche wee &s;uppo&s;e is not without &s;ome ri|ches, all the hills &s;hewing minerall matters in the~.

<P>And wee came to another lande being 15. leagues di&s;tant from the Ilande, where wee founde a pa&s;&s;ing good hauen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Countrey of Sir H. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">. voyage.</NOTE> wherein being entred we founde about 20. &s;mall boates of the people which with diuers cries and wondrings came a|bout our &s;hippe, comming no nerer then 50. paces towards vs, they &s;tayed and behelde the artificialne&s;&s;e of our &s;hip, our &s;hape &amp; apparel, tha~ they al made a loud &s;howte together de|claring that they reioyced: when we had &s;omething anima|ted them v&s;ing their gea&s;tes, they came &s;o neere vs that wee ca&s;t them certaine bells and gla&s;&s;es and many toyes, whiche when they had receiued they lookte on them with laughing &amp; came without feare aborde our &s;hip. There were among&s;t the&s;e people 2. kings of &s;o goodly &s;tature and &s;hape as is po&s;|&s;ible to declare, the elde&s;t was about 40. yeeres of ag, the &s;e|cond was a yong man of 20. yeres old. Their apparell was on this maner, the elder had vpo~ his naked body a harts &s;kin wrought artificialie with diuers braunches like Dama&s;ke, his head was bare with the haire tyed vp behinde with diuers knottes: About his necke he had a large chaine, garni&s;hed with diuers &s;tones of &s;undrie colours the young man was almo&s;t appareled after the &s;ame manner. This is the good|lie&s;t people and of the faire&s;t conditions that wee haue found in this our voyage. They exceed vs in bignes, they are of the colour of bra&s;&s;e, &s;ome of the~ encline more to whitnes: others are of yellowe colour, of comely vi&s;age with long &amp; blacke heire which they are very carefull to trim and decke vp, they are blacke and quicke eyed. I write not to your Maie&s;tie, of the other parte of their bodie, hauing all &s;uche proportion as appertayneth to anye hand&s;ome man. The women are of the like conformitie and Beawtie, verie hand&s;ome and well fauoured, they are as well mannered and conti|nente as anye women, of good education, they are all naked &s;aue their priuie partes whiche they couer with a Deares &s;kinne braunched or embrodered as the men v&s;e: there are al&s;o of them whiche weare on their armes verie riche &s;kinnes of leopardes, they adorne their heades with diuers ornamentes made of their owne heire, whiche hange

<P>Among whom wee &s;awe many plates of wrought coper, which they e&s;teeme more then golde, whiche for the colour they make no accompt of, for that among all other it is counted the ba&s;e&s;t, they make mo&s;t accompt of <HI>Azure</HI> and <HI>red.</HI> The things that they e&s;teemed mo&s;t of al tho&s;e which we gaue them were bels, cri&s;tall of Azure colour, and other toies to hang at their eares or about their necke. They did not de|&s;ire cloth of &s;ilke or of golde, muche le&s;&s;e of any other &s;orte, neither cared they for thinges made of &s;teele and Iron, which wee often &s;hewed them in our armour whiche they made no wonder at, and in beholding them they onely a&s;ked the arte of making them: the like they did at our gla&s;&s;es, which whe~ the behelde, they &s;odainely laught and gaue them vs againe. They are very liberal for they giue that which they haue, we became great friendes with the&s;e, and one day wee entred in|to the hauen with our &s;hippe, where as before wee rode a league of at &s;ea by rea&s;on of the contrary weather. They came in great companies of their &s;mall boates vnto the &s;hip with their faces all be painted with diuers colours, &s;hewing vs y^t it was a &s;igne of ioy, bringing vs of their victuals, they made &s;ignes vnto vs where wee might &s;afe&s;t ride in the ha|uen for the &s;afegarde of our &s;hippe keeping &s;till our compa|nie: and after we were come to an Ancker, we be&s;towed fif|teene dayes in prouiding our &s;elues many nece&s;&s;ary things, whether euery day the people repayred to &s;ee our &s;hip bring|ing their wiues with them, whereof they are very ielous: and they them&s;elues entring abrode the &s;hippe and &s;tayinge there a good &s;pace, cau&s;ed their wiues to &s;tay in their boates, and for al the intreatie we could make, offering to giue them diuers things, we could neuer obtaine that they would &s;uffer them to come aborde our &s;hip. And oftentimes one of the two kings comming with his queene, and many gentlemen for their plea&s;ure to &s;ee vs, they all &s;tayed on y^e &s;hore two hun|dred
<PB REF="28"> paces fro~ vs, &s;ending a &s;mal boate to giue vs intellige~ce of their comming, &s;aying they would come to &s;ee our &s;hippe, this they did in token of &s;afetye, and a&s;&s;oone as they had an|&s;were from vs they came immediatly, and hauing &s;tayed a while to beholde it, they wondered at hearing the cryes and noyes of the marriners. The queene and her maids &s;tayed in a very light boate, at an Iland a quarter of a leage off, while the king abode a long &s;pace in our &s;hip vttering diuers con|ceites with gea&s;tures, viewing with great admiration, all the furniture of the &s;hippe, demaunding the propertie of euerie thing perticularly. He tooke likewi&s;e great plea&s;ure in beholding our apparell, and in ta&s;ting our meates, and &s;o courteou&s;ly taking his leaue departed. And &s;ometimes our men &s;taying for two or three dayes on a litle Ilande nere the &s;hip for diuers nece&s;&s;aries, (as it is y^e v&s;e of &s;eamen) he retur|ned with 7. or 8. of his gentlemen to &s;ee what we did, and a&s;|ked of vs oft times if wee meant to make any long aboade there, offering vs of their proui&s;ion: then the king drawing his bowe and running vp and downe with his gentlemen, made much &s;porte to gratifie our men, wee were oftentimes within the lande 5. or 6. leagues, which we found as plea&s;ant as is po&s;&s;ible to declare very apt for any kinde of hu&s;bandry of corne, wine and oyle: for that there are plaines 25. or 30. leagues broad, open and without any impediment of trees of &s;uch fruitfulne&s;&s;e, that any &s;eede being &s;owne therein, will bring forth mo&s;t excellent fruite. We entred afterwards in|to the woods which wee found &s;o great and thicke, that any armie were it neuer &s;o great might haue hid it &s;elfe therein, the trees whereof are okes, cipres trees, and other &s;ortes vn|knowen in <HI>Europe.</HI> We found Pomi appii, Dam&s;on trees, and Nutte trees, and many other &s;orts of fruits differing fro~ ours: there are bea&s;ts in great abundance, as hartes, deares, leopardes, and other kinds which they take with their nets &amp; bowes which are their chiefe weapons, the arrowes whiche they v&s;e are made with great cunning, and in &s;teade of iron, they head them with &s;meriglio, w^t ia&s;per &s;tone, &amp; hard mar|ble &amp; other &s;harp &s;tones which they v&s;e in &s;tead of iron to cut
<PB REF="29"> trees, and make their boates of one whole piece of wood, ma|king it hollowe with great and wonderfull art, wherein 10. or 12. men may bee co~modiou&s;ly, their oares are &s;horte and broad at the ende, and they v&s;e them in the &s;ea without anye daunger, and by maine force of armes, with as great &s;peedi|ne&s;&s;e as they li&s;te them &s;elues. We &s;awe their hou&s;es made in circuler or rounde fourme 10. or 12. foote in compa&s;&s;e, made with halfe circles of timber, &s;eperate one from ano|ther without any order of building, couered with mattes of &s;trawe wrought cunningly together, which &s;aue them from the winde and raine, and if they had the order of building and perfect &s;kil of workma~&s;hip as we haue: there were no doubt but y^t they would al&s;o make eft&s;oones great and &s;tately buil|dings. For all the &s;ea coa&s;tes are full of cleare and gli&s;tering &s;tones, and alabla&s;ter, and therefore it is full of good hauens and barbarours for &s;hips. They mooue the fore&s;aide hou&s;es from one place to another according to the commoditie of the place and &s;ea&s;on wherein they will make their aboade, and only taking of the couer, they haue other hou&s;es builded incontinent. The father and the whole familie dwell toge|ther in one hou&s;e in great number: in &s;ome of them we &s;awe 25. or 30. per&s;ons. They feede as the other doe afore&s;aide of pul&s;e whiche doe growe in that countrey with better order of hu&s;bandry the~ in the others. They ob&s;erue in their &s;owing the cour&s;e of the Moone and the ri&s;ing of certaine &s;tarres, and diuers other cu&s;tomes &s;poken of by antiquitie. Moreo|uer, they liue by hunting and fi&s;hing. they liue long, and are &s;eldome &s;icke, and if they chaunce to fall &s;icke at any time, they heale them &s;elues with fire without any phi&s;ition, and they &s;ay that they die for very age. They are very pitiful and charitable towardes their neighbours, they make great la|mentations in their aduer&s;itie &amp; in their mi&s;erie, the kinred recken vp all their felicitie, at their departure out of life, they v&s;e mourning mixt w^t &s;inging, w^t continueth for a lo~g &s;pace. This is a&s;much as wee coulde learne of them. This lande is &s;ituated in the Paralele of <HI>Rome,</HI> in 41. degrees &amp; 2. terces:
<PB REF="29"> but &s;omewhat more colde by accidentall cau&s;e and not of nature, (as I will declare vnto your highne&s;&s;e els where) de&s;cribing at this pre&s;ent the &s;ituation of the fore&s;aide coun|trie, which lyeth Ea&s;t and We&s;t, I &s;ay that the mouth of the hauen lyeth open to the South halfe a league broade, and being entred within it betweene the Ea&s;t and the North, it &s;tretcheth twelue leagues: where it waxeth broder and bro|der, and maketh a gulfe aboute 20. leagues in compa&s;&s;e, wherein are fine &s;mall I&s;landes very fruitfull and plea&s;ant, full of hie and broade trees, among the which Ilandes, any great Nauie may ryde &s;afe without any feare of tempe&s;t or other daunger. Afterwardes turning towards the South and in the entring into the Hauen on both &s;ides there are mo&s;t plea&s;ant hilles, with many riuers of mo&s;t cleere water falling into the Sea.</P>
<P>In the midde&s;t of this entraunce there is a rock of free &s;tone growing by nature apt to builde any Ca&s;tle or For|tre&s;&s;e there, for y^e keeping of the hauen. The fift of May be|ing furni&s;hed with all thinges nece&s;&s;arie, we departed from y^e &s;aid Coa&s;t keeping along in the &s;ight thereof, &amp; we &s;ayled 150 leagues finding it all wayes after one manner: but the lande &s;omewhat higher with certaine mountaines all which beare a &s;hewe of minerall matter, wee &s;ought not to lande there in any place, becau&s;e the weather &s;erued our turne for &s;ayling: but wee &s;uppo&s;e that it was like to the former, the Coa&s;t ranne Ea&s;tward for the &s;pace of fiftie leagues. And trending afterwardes the North, wee founde another lande high full of thicke woods, the trees whereof were firres, Ci|pre&s;&s;es and &s;uch like as are wont to growe in colde Coun|tries. The people differ much from the other, &amp; looke how much the former &s;eemed to be courteous and gentle: &s;o much were the&s;e full of rudene&s;&s;e and ill manners, and &s;o barba|rous that by no &s;ignes that euer wee coulde make, wee could haue any kinde of trafficke with them. They cloth the~&s;elues with Beares &s;kinnes and Leopardes and &s;ealles and other bea&s;tes &s;kinnes. Their foode as farre as wee coulde per|cieue,
<PB REF="30"> repayring often vnto their dwellings wee &s;uppo&s;e to bee by hunting and fi&s;hing, and of certaine fruites, which are a kinde of rootes, which the earth yeeldeth of her owne ac|cord. They haue no graine, neither &s;awe wee any kinde or &s;igne of tyllage, neither is the lande, for the barrennes ther|of apt to beare frute or &s;eed. If at any time we de&s;ired by ex|chaunge to haue any of their commodities, they v&s;ed to come to the Sea &s;hore vpon certaine craggie rocks, and wee &s;tan|ding in our Boats, they let downe with a rope what it plea|&s;ed them to giue vs, crying continually that wee &s;hould not approch to the lande, demanding immediately the exchange taking nothing but kniues, fi&s;hookes and tooles to cut with|all, neither did they make any account of our curte&s;ie. And when we had nothing left to exchange with them, when we departed from them the people &s;hewed all &s;ignes of di&s;cour|te&s;ie and di&s;daine, as was po&s;&s;ible for any creature to inuent. Wee were in de&s;pight of them two or three leagues within the lande, being in number 25. armed men of vs: And when wee went on &s;hore they &s;hot at vs with their bowes, making great outcries, and afterwardes fled into the woods. Wee founde not in this lande any thing notable, or of importance, &s;auing very great woods and certaine hilles, they may haue &s;ome mynerall matter in them, becau&s;e wee &s;awe many of the~ haue bead&s;tones of Copper hanging at their eares. We departed from thence keeping our cour&s;e North Ea&s;t along the coa&s;te, which wee founde more plea&s;ant champion and without woods, with high mountaines within the lande continuing directly along the coa&s;t for the &s;pace of fiftie leagues, wee di&s;couered 32. Ilelandes lying all neare the lande, being &s;mall and plea&s;ant to the viewe, high and ha|uing many turnings and windings betwene them, making many fayre harboroughes and chanels as they doe in the goulfe of <HI>Venice</HI> in <HI>Saluonia,</HI> and <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> wee had no knowledge or acquaintance with the people: wee &s;uppo&s;e they are of the &s;ame maners and nature that the others are.

<PB REF="30"> to the lande that in times pa&s;t was di&s;couered by the <HI>Britons,</HI> which is in fiftie degrees.

<P>Touching the religion of this people, which wee haue founde for want of their language we could not vnder&s;tand neither by &s;ignes nor ge&s;ture that they had any religion or lawe at all, or that they did acknowledge any fir&s;t cau&s;e or mouer, neither that they wor&s;hip the heauen or &s;tarres the Sunne or Moone or other Planets, and much le&s;&s;e whe|ther they bee idolaters, neither coulde wee learne whether that they v&s;ed any kinde of Sacrifices or other adorations, neither in their villages haue they any Temples or hou&s;es of prayer.

Wherefore promi|&s;ing the~ all, that they &s;houlde receiue no di&s;courte&s;ie, and that they were come into a place where they &s;houlde bee well v|&s;ed and very welcome, he tooke them into his protection vp|on his faith. This was a great Lord and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed certaine Ilands called <HI>Porland,</HI> lying one the South&s;ide of <HI>Fri&s;land</HI> being y^e riche&s;t and mo&s;t populous of all tho&s;e partes, his name was <HI>Zichmni:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zichmni prince of Porland or duke of Zorani.</NOTE> &amp; be&s;ide the &s;aid little Ilands, he was Duke of <HI>Sorani,</HI> lying within the land towards <HI>Scotland.</HI> Of the&s;e North partes I thought good to draw the copie of a Sea carde, which amonge&s;t other antiquities, I haue in my hou&s;e, which although it be rotten through many yeres: yet it falleth out indifferent well, and to tho&s;e that are de|lighted in the&s;e things, it may &s;erue for &s;ome light to the vn|der&s;tanding of that, which without it cannot &s;o ea&s;ily be con|ceiued. <HI>Zichmni</HI> being Lorde of tho&s;e Seignories (as is &s;aid) was a very warlike and valiant man &amp; aboue al things famous in Sea cau&s;es.

Wherefore &s;eeing that <HI>M.

<PB REF="32"> honour him and in all things to v&s;e his coun&s;aile. This Nauie of <HI>Zichmni</HI> was of thirteene ve&s;&s;els, wherof two on|ly were with oares, the re&s;t &s;mall barkes, and one &s;hip, with the which they &s;ayled to the We&s;twardes and with little paines wonne <HI>Ledouo</HI> and <HI>Ilofe</HI> and diuers other &s;mall I|landes, and turning into a bay called <HI>Sudero,</HI> in the hauen of the towne named <HI>Sanestol</HI> they tooke certaine &s;mall Barks laden with &s;alt fi&s;h. And heere they founde <HI>Zichmni,</HI> who came by land with his armie conquering all the countrie as he went, they &s;taied here but a while but held on their cour&s;e to the We&s;twards till they came to the other Cape of the goulfe or bay, then turning againe they found certaine Ile|landes and broken landes which they reduced all vnto the Seignorie and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Zichmni.</HI> The&s;e Seas for as much as they &s;ayled, were in maner nothing but &s;holds and rocks, in &s;ort that if <HI>M.

Now the Fleete hauing doone &s;uch things, (as is decla|red) y^e Captaine by the coun&s;el of <HI>M.

Wherefore wee were forced to depart and to &s;ayle along in a great circuite about the Iland, being alwaies accompanied vpon the hil tops and the Sea coa&s;t with an infinite multitude of armed men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Infinite multi|tude of armed men in Icaria.</NOTE> and &s;o doubling the Cape of the Iland towardes the North, wee found many great &s;holdes among&s;t the which for the &s;pace of ten daies we were in continual danger of loo&s;ing our whole Fleete, but that it plea&s;ed God all that while to &s;end vs very faire weather. Wherefore proceeding on till we came to y^e Ea&s;t cape, we &s;awe the inhabitaunts &s;till on the hill tops &amp; by the Sea coa&s;t keepe with vs, and in making great out|cries &amp; &s;hooting at vs a farre of they vttered their olde &s;pite|full affection towards vs. Wherefore we determined to &s;tay in &s;ome &s;afe harborough, and &s;ee if we might &s;peak once againe with the <HI>I&s;lander,</HI> but our determination was fru|&s;trate, for the people more like vnto bea&s;tes than men, &s;tood continually in armes w^t intent to beat vs backe, if we &s;hould come on lande. Wherefore <HI>Zichmni</HI> &s;eeing hee coulde not preuaile and thought if hee &s;houlde haue per&s;euered and

<P>_WHere as in the yeere of our Lorde God 1562. it plea&s;ed God to moue your honour, to choo&s;e and appoint vs, to di&s;|couer and view a certaine long coa&s;t of the We&s;t India, from the head of the lande called La|florida, drawing towarde the North part, vnto the head of Britons, di&s;tant from the &s;aide head of Laflorida 900. leagues, or there about: to the ende wee might certifie you &amp; make true report of the tempera|ture, fertilitie, Portes, Hauens, Riuers, and generally of all the commodities that bee &s;eene and found in that lande, and al&s;o to learne what people were there dwelling, which thing you haue long time agoe de&s;ired, beeing &s;tirred therevnto by this zeale: That Fraunce might one day through newe di&s;coueries haue knowledge of &s;trange Countries, and al&s;o thereof to receiue (by meanes of continuall trafficke) riche and ine&s;timable commodities, as other nations haue done by taking in hand &s;uch farre nauigations, both to the honor and prowes of their kings and princes, &amp; al&s;o to the encrea&s;e of great profite and v&s;e to their common wealthes, countries &amp; dominions, which is mo&s;t of all w^tout co~pari&s;o~ to be con&s;ide|red &amp; e&s;teemed. It &s;eemeth well y^t yee haue been &s;tirred here|unto euen of God aboue, &amp; led to it by the hope &amp; de&s;ire you haue that a number of bruti&s;he people and ignorant of Ie&s;us Chri&s;te, may by his grace come to &s;ome knowledge of his holy Lawes and Ordinaunces. So therefore it &s;ee|meth that it hath plea&s;ed God by his godly prouidence to
<PB REF="41"> re&s;erue the care which hee hath had of their &s;aluation vntill this time, and will bring them to our faith, at the time by him&s;elfe alone fore&s;eene and ordeined. For if it were need|full to &s;hewe howe many from time to time haue gone about to finde out this great lande, and to inhabite there: who ne|uerthele&s;&s;e haue alwaies failed &amp; beene put by from their in|tention and purpo&s;e: &s;ome by feare of &s;hipwrackes, and &s;ome by great windes and tempe&s;tes that droue them backe to their merueilous griefe. Of the which there was one a very famous &s;tranger named Seba&s;tian Gabota<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seba&s;tian Gabota.</NOTE> an excel|lent Pylot &s;ent thither by king Henry, the yeere 1498. and many others, who neuer could attaine to any habitation nor take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof one only foote of grounde, nor yet ap|proche or enter into the&s;e parties and faire riuers into the which God hath brought vs. Wherefore (my Lorde) it may bee well &s;aide that the liuing God hath re&s;erued this great lande for your poore &s;eruantes and &s;ubiectes, as well to the ende they might bee made great ouer this poore people, &amp; rude nation: as al&s;o to approue the former affection which our kings haue had vnto this di&s;couerie.</P>
<P>For y^e late king Frances the fir&s;t (of happie memorie) a Prince endued with excellent vertues. The yeere 1524. &s;ent a famous and notable man a Florentine, named Ma&s;ter Iohn Verarzan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn Verarza~.</NOTE> to &s;earch and di&s;couer the We&s;t parts as farre as might be: Who departing from Deepe with two ve&s;&s;els little differing from the making and bur|den of the&s;e two Pinnaces of the kinges, which your honour hath ordeined for this pre&s;ent nauigation. In the which land they haue found the eleuation the Pole, an viii. degrees. The Countrie (as he writeth) goodly, fruitfull, and &s;o good tem|perature, that it is not po&s;&s;ible to haue a better: beeing then as yet of no ma~ &s;een, nor di&s;cerned. But they being not able to bring to pa&s;&s;e at this fir&s;t voyage that which he had inten|ded, nor to arriue in any Port, by rea&s;on of &s;undrie inco~ueni|ences (which co~mo~ly happe~) were co~&s;trained to return into Fraunce: where after his arriuall, he neuer cea&s;&s;ed to make
<PB REF="41"> &s;uite vntill he was &s;ent thither againe, where at la&s;t he died. The which occa&s;ion gaue &s;mall courage to &s;ende thither a|gayne, and was the cau&s;e that this laudable enterpri&s;e was left of, vntill the yeere 1534. at which time his Maie&s;tie, (de|&s;iring alwayes to enlarge his kingdome, countreys and do|minions, and the aduauncing and ea&s;e of his &s;ubiectes) &s;ent thither a Pilote of S. Mallowes, a briton, named Iames Cartier,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iames Cartier</NOTE> well &s;eene in the art and knowledge of Nauigati|on, &amp; e&s;pecially of the North parts, commonly called the new land, led by &s;ome hope to find pa&s;&s;age that waies to the &s;outh &s;eas: Who being not able at his fir&s;t going to bring any thing to pa&s;&s;e, that he prete~ded to do: was &s;ent thither againe the yeere following, and likewi&s;e Le &s;ire Hemerall, and as it is well knowen they did inhabite and builde, and plant the kings armies in the North part a good way in the lande, as farre as <HI>Tauadu</HI> and <HI>Ochi&s;aon.</HI> Wherefore (my Lord) tru&s;t iu&s;tly that a thing &s;o commendable and worthie to bee with good courage attempted, that God woulde guid and keepe vs, de&s;iring alwayes to fulfill your commaundement. When wee had done your bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and made our prepara|tions the xviii. day of Februarie 1562 through the fauour of God wee departed with our two ve&s;&s;els out of the hauen of Claue de Grace into the road Caur: and the next day hoy&s;ted vp &s;aile (the winde being in y^e Ea&s;t) which la&s;ted &s;o fiue daies, that we coulde not arriue at the nauch that is from betweene the coa&s;t of Briton and Englande and the Iles of Surlinos and Wi&s;kam: So that the Winde blowing with great fu|ry and tempe&s;t out of the We&s;t, and We&s;t Southwe&s;t, alto|gether contrary to our way and cour&s;e, and all that we could doe was to none effecte, be&s;ides the great daunger of brea|king of our Ma&s;tes, as al&s;o to be hindered in our other la|bours. Wherefore as well to &s;honne many other inconueni|ences, which might follow to the preiudice and breach of our voyage, hauing regard al&s;o to the likely daunger of death, y^e &s;ome of our gentlemen and &s;ouldiers being troubled with feuers and whot &s;ickne&s;&s;es, might haue fallen into: as al&s;o
<PB REF="42"> for other con&s;iderations, wee thought good to fall into the road of Bre&s;t in Britaine, to &s;et there our &s;ick folke on land, and &s;uffer the tempe&s;t to pa&s;&s;e. From whence (after wee had taried there two dayes) wee returned againe to Sea|warde to followe our nauigation, &s;o that (my Lorde) albeit the winde was for a long &s;ea&s;on very much again&s;t vs, and trouble&s;ome: yet at the ende (God giuing vs through his grace and accu&s;tomed goodne&s;&s;e a meetely fauourable winde) I determined with all diligence to proue a newe cour&s;e which hath not beene yet attempted: trauer&s;ing the Seas of Oction 1800. Leagues at the lea&s;t, whiche in deed is the true and &s;hort cour&s;e that hereafter mu&s;t be kept, to the honour of our nation, reiecting the old con&s;erued opi|on, which to long time hath beene holden as true.</P>
<P>Which is, as it was thought a thing impo&s;&s;ible to haue the winde at Ea&s;t, Northea&s;t, and keepe the race and cour&s;e wee enterpri&s;ed, but that we &s;houlde be driuen towarde the region of Affrica, the Iles of Canaria, Madera, and other landes there aboutes. And the cau&s;e why we haue beene the more prouoked and a&s;&s;ured to take this new race, hath bin be|cau&s;e that it &s;eemed to euery one, that we might not pa&s;&s;e nor goe in this Nauigation without the &s;ight and touching of the Antillies and Lucaries, and there &s;oiourne and take fre&s;h waters and other nece&s;&s;aries, as the Spaniards doe in their voyage to new &s;paine: wherof (thanked be God) we haue had no neede, nor entered the chanell of Roham: which hath bin thought impo&s;&s;ible. Fore&s;eeing al&s;o that it was not expedient for vs to pa&s;&s;e through the Ilandes, as wel to &s;hune many in|conueniences that might happen in pa&s;&s;ing that way (wherof &s;pringeth nothing but innumerable quarrels, pleadings, co~|fu&s;ions, and breach of al worthy enterpri&s;es, and goodly naui|gations, whereof en&s;ueth complaintes and odious que&s;tions betweene the &s;ubiectes of the king and his friends and alies) as al&s;o to the ende they might vnder&s;tand, that in the time to come (God hauing &s;hewed vs &s;uch graces, as the&s;e his won|derfull benefites fir&s;te &s;hewed to the poore people of this &s;o
<PB REF="42"> goodly newe framing people, of &s;o gentle a nature, and a countrey &s;o plea&s;ant and fruitefull, lacking nothing at all that may &s;eeme nece&s;&s;arie for mans food) we would not haue to doe with their Ilandes, and other landes: which (for that they fir&s;t di&s;couered them) they keepe with much ielou&s;ie: tru&s;ting that if God will &s;uffer the king (through your per|&s;wation) to cau&s;e &s;ome part of this incomparable countrey to be peopled and inhabited with &s;uch a number of his poore &s;ubiectes as you &s;hall thinke good, there neuer happened in the memory of man &s;o great and good commoditie to France as this, and (my Lorde) for many cau&s;es, whereof a man is neuer able to &s;ay or write to the ful, as vnder the a&s;&s;ured hope that we haue alwayes had in executing vprightly that which I had receiued in charge of you, God woulde ble&s;&s;e our wayes and nauigations. After we had con&s;tantly and with diligence in time conuenient determined vpon the way, wee &s;houlde haue thought it noy&s;ome and tedious to all our com|panie, if it had before bin knowe~ vnto any without tourning or wauering to or fro from their fir&s;t ententio~. And notwith|&s;tanding that &s;atan did often what he could to &s;owe many ob|&s;tractes, troubles and lettes, according to his acu&s;tomed &s;ub|tilties, &s;o it is come to pa&s;&s;e, that God by his onely goodnes hath giuen vs grace, to make the furthe&s;t arte and trauars of the &s;eas, that euer was made in our memorie or knowledge, in longitude from the Ea&s;t to the We&s;t: and therefore was it commonly &s;ayde both in Fraunce and Spaine, and al&s;o a|mong vs, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for vs &s;afely to ariue thither, whither the Lord did conduct vs. Al which per&s;waded but of igoraunce and lacke of attempting: which wee haue not bin afrayde to giue aduenture to prooue. Albeit that all Ma|riners Cardes doe &s;et the Coa&s;tes with &s;hipwrackes with|out portes or Riuers: which wee haue found otherwi&s;e as it followeth.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day the la&s;t of Aprill at the breake of the day, wee di&s;couered and clearely perceyued a fayre Coa&s;t, &s;tret|chyng of a great length couered with an infinite number of
<PB REF="43"> high and fayre trees, wee being not pa&s;t 7. or 8. leagues from the &s;hore, the countrey &s;eeming vnto vs plaine without anye &s;hewe of hils, and approching neerer within foure or fiue lea|gues of the land, we ca&s;t an ancker at ten fadome water, the bottome of the Sea being plaine with muche Ocias and fa&s;t holde on the South &s;ide, as farre as a certaine point or Cape &s;ituate vnder that Latitude of nine and twentie degrees and a halfe, which we haue named Cape Francois.</P>
<P>Wee coulde e&s;pie neither Riuer nor Bay, wherefore wee &s;ent our Boates furni&s;hed with men of experience, to founde and knowe the coa&s;t neere the &s;hore: who returning to vs about one of the clock at after noone, declared that they had founde among other thinges viii. fadome of water at the harde bancke of the &s;ea. Wherevpon hauing diligently wayed vp our Anckers, and hoy&s;ted vp our &s;ayles with wind at will, we &s;ayled and vewed the coa&s;t all along with vn&s;pea|ble plea&s;ure, of the odorous &s;mell and beawtie of the &s;ame. And becau&s;e there appeared vnto vs no &s;igne of any Porte, about the &s;etting of the &s;unne we ca&s;t ancker againe: which done, we did behold to and fro the goodly order of the woods wherewith God hath decked euery way the &s;ayd land. Then perceiuing towarde the North a leaping and a breaking of the water, as a &s;treame falling out of the lande into the Sea. For the whiche wee &s;et vp &s;ayles againe to double the &s;ame while it was yet day. And as wee had &s;o done, and pa&s;&s;ed be|yond it: there appeared vnto vs a fayre entrie of a faire riuer which cau&s;ed vs to ca&s;t Ancker agayne there nerer the land: to the end the next day we might &s;ee what it was, and though that the winde blew for a time vehemently to the &s;horeward: yet the hold and Anckerrage was &s;o good, that one cable and one Ancker helde vs fa&s;t, with out danger or &s;liding.</P>
<P>The next day in the morning, being the fir&s;t of May, wee a&s;&s;ayed to enter this Porte, with two newe barges and a boate well trimmed, finding little water barges whiche might haue a&s;tonied and cau&s;ed vs to returne backe to &s;hip|borde, if God had not &s;peedily brought vs in. Where find|ing 36. fadome water, entred into a goodly and great riuer,
<PB REF="43"> which as we went founde to encrea&s;e &s;till in depth &amp; large|ne&s;&s;e, boyling and roaring through the multitude of all kind of fi&s;h. This being entred wee perceiued a great number of y^e Indians inhabitants there, comming along the &s;andes &amp; Sea bankes, comming neare vnto vs, without any taking of feare or doubt, &s;hewing vnto vs the ea&s;ie&s;t landing place: &amp; thereupon we giuing them al&s;o on our parts thanks of a&s;|&s;urance and friendline&s;&s;e. Forthwith one of appearance, out of the be&s;t among them, brother vnto one of their kinges, or gouernours, commaunded one of the Indians to enter into the water: and to approch our boates to &s;hew vs the coa&s;tes landing place. We &s;eeing this (without any more doubting or difficultie) landed, and the me&s;&s;enger (after we had rewar|ded him with &s;ome looking gla&s;&s;e, and other pretie things of &s;mall value) ran incontinently toward his Lord: Who forth with &s;ent mee his girdle, in token of a&s;&s;uraunce and friend|&s;hip, which girdle was made of red leather, as well couered and coloured as was po&s;&s;ible: and as I began to go towards him, hee &s;et foorth and came and receiued me gently, and rei|&s;ed after his maner all his men, following with great &s;ilence and mode&s;tie: yea more then our men did. And after we had a while with gentle v&s;age congratulated with him: we fell to the grounde a litle way from them, to call vpon the name of God, and to be&s;eech him to co~tinue &s;till his goodne&s;&s;e to|wards vs, and bring to the knowledge of our &s;auiour Chri&s;t this poore people. While wee were thus praying (they &s;it|ting vpon the grounde, which was &s;trawed and dre&s;&s;ed with Bay bowes) behelde and hearkened vnto vs, very attentiue|ly without either &s;peking or mouing: and as I made a &s;igne vnto their king, lifting vp mine arme, and &s;tretching foorth one finger, only to make them looke vp to heauen ward: He likewi&s;e lifting vp his arme towards heauen put foorth two fingers: whereby it &s;eemed that he made vs to vnder&s;tande, that they wor&s;hipped the Sunne and y^e moone for Gods: as afterwardes wee vnder&s;toode it &s;o. In the meane time their numbers increa&s;ed, &amp; thither came the kings brother, that was fir&s;t with vs, their mother, wiues, &s;i&s;ters and chil|dren,
<PB REF="44"> and being thus a&s;&s;embled, they cau&s;ed a great number of Bay boughes to bee cut, and therewith a place to be dre&s;|&s;ed for vs, di&s;tant from theirs two fadom. For it is their ma|ner to talke and bargaine &s;itting: and the chiefe of them to bee apart, from the meaner &s;ort, with a &s;hewe of great obe|dience to their kinges, &s;uperiours, and elders. They bee all naked, and of a goodly &s;tature, mightie, &amp; as well &s;hapen &amp; proportioned of body, as any people in y^e world: very gentle, curteous, and of a good nature.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t part of them couer their raines and priuities with faire Harts &s;kinnes, painted mo&s;t commonly with &s;un|drie colours: and the fore part of their body and armes, bee painted with pretie deui&s;ed workes, of Azure, red, and blacke, &s;o well and &s;o properly as the be&s;t Painter of Eu|rope coulde not amende it. The women haue their bo|dies painted with a certaine Herbe like vnto Mo&s;&s;e, where|of the Cedar trees, and all other trees bee alwayes couered. The men for plea&s;ure doe alwayes trimme them &s;elues therwith, after &s;undrie fa&s;hions: They bee of tauny colour, hauke no&s;ed, and of a plea&s;ant countenance. The women be well fauoured, and will not &s;uffer one di&s;hone&s;tly to approch too neare them. But wee were not in their hou&s;es for we &s;awe none at that time.</P>
<P>After we had taried in this North &s;ide of the riuer the mo&s;t part of the day (which riuer wee haue called May,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the riuer of May was &s;o called.</NOTE> for that wee di&s;couered the &s;ame the fir&s;te day of the Moneth) wee congratulated, made aliaunce, and entred into ami|tie with them, and pre&s;ented the king and his brethren with Gownes of blewe cloth garni&s;hed with yellowe Floure de|luces. And it &s;eemed that they were &s;ory for our departure: &s;o that the mo&s;t part of them entred into the water vp to the necke, to &s;et our boates a flote.</P>
<P>Putting into vs &s;undry kinde of fi&s;hes, which with mer|ueilous &s;peede they ranne to take in their packs, made in the water with great Reedes, &s;o well and cunningly &s;et togea|ther, after the fa&s;hion of a Laberinth, or Maze, with &s;o many
<PB REF="44"> turnes and crookes, as it is impo&s;&s;ible to do it without much cunning and indu&s;trie.</P>
<P>But de&s;iring to imploy the re&s;t of the day on the other &s;ide of this riuer, to viewe and know tho&s;e Indians that wee &s;awe there. We trauer&s;ed thither, and without any diffi|cultie landed amonge&s;t them, who receiued vs very gently and with great humanitie: putting vs of their fruites, euen into our boates, Mulberies, Ra&s;pis, and &s;uch other fruites as they founde ready by the way.</P>
<P>Soone after this came thither the king with his brethren, and others with bowes and arrowes in their handes, v&s;ing therewithall a goodly and a graue fa&s;hion, with their beha|uiour right &s;ouldierlike, and as warlike boldnes as may be. They were naked and painted as the other, their haire like|wi&s;e long, and tru&s;&s;ed vp (with a lace made of herbes) to the top of their heads: but they had neither their wiues nor chil|dren in their companie. After we had a good while louingly enterteined and pre&s;ented them with like gifts of haber&s;her wares, cutting hookes and hatchets, and clothed the king &amp; his brethren with like robes, as we had giuen to them on the other &s;ide: we entred and viewed the countrie thereaboutes, which is the faire&s;t, fruitfulle&s;t, &amp; plea&s;ante&s;t of al the world, abounding in hony, veni&s;on, wilde foule, fore&s;ts, woods of all &s;ortes, Palme trees, Cypre&s;&s;e and Cedars, Bayes y^e high|e&s;t and greate&s;t, with al&s;o the fayre&s;t vines in all the world, with grapes according, which without natural art and with|out mans helpe or trimming will grow to toppes of Okes, and other trees that be of a wonderfull greatne&s;&s;e &amp; height. And the &s;ight of the faire medowes is a plea&s;ure not able to be expre&s;&s;ed with tongue: full of Hernes, Curlues, Bitters, Mallards, Egrepths, woodcocks, &amp; all other kinde of &s;mall birds: with Harts, Hindes, Buckes, wilde Swine, and all other kindes of wilde bea&s;tes, as we perceiued well both by their footing there, and al&s;o afterwardes in other places, by their crie and roaring in the night.</P>
<P>Al&s;o there be Conies &amp; Hares: Silke wormes in meruei|lous number, a great deale fairer and better, then be our &s;ilk
<PB REF="45"> wormes. To bee &s;hort, it is a thing vn&s;peakeable to con&s;ider the thinges that bee &s;eene there, and &s;halbe founde more and more, in this incomperable lande, which neuer yet broken with plough yrons, bringeth forth al things according to his fir&s;t nature, wherewith the eternall God indued it. A|bout their hou&s;es they labour and till the grounde, &s;owing their fieldes with a graine called Mahis, whereof they make their meale: and in their Gardens they plant beanes, gourdes, cucumbers, Citrons, pea&s;on, and many other fruits and rootes vnknowen vnto vs. Their &s;pades and mat|tocks be made of Wood, &s;o well and fitly as is po&s;&s;ible: which they make with certaine &s;tones, oy&s;ter &s;helles &amp; mu&s;|cles, wherewith al&s;o they make their bowes and &s;mal laun|ces: and cut &amp; poli&s;h all &s;ortes of wood, that they imploye a|bout their buildings, and nece&s;&s;arie v&s;e: There groweth al|&s;o many Walnut trees, Ha&s;ell trees, Cheritrees, very faire and great.</P>
<P>And generally wee haue &s;eene, thereof the &s;ame &s;imples and herbes that wee haue in Fraunce, and of the like good|ne&s;&s;e, &s;auour and ta&s;te. The people be very good archers, and of great &s;trength: Their bowe &s;tringes are made of Leather, and their arrowes of Reedes which they doe head with the teeth of fi&s;hes. As we now demaunded of them con|cerning y^e land called Seuola, whereof &s;ome haue written not to bee farre from thence, and to bee &s;ituate within the lande,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seuola within xx. daies trauai|ling by boate of the riuer of May.</NOTE> and toward the Sea called the South Sea. They &s;hewed vs by &s;ignes that which we vnder&s;tood well enough, that they might goe thither with their Boates (by riuers) in twentie dayes. They that haue written of this kingdome and towne of Seuola, and other townes and kingdomes thereaboutes, &s;ay, that there is great aboundance of golde and &s;iluer, precious &s;tones, and other great riches: and that the people had their arrowes headed (in &s;teede of yron) with &s;harpe pointed Turque&s;&s;es. Thus the night appro|ching, it was conuenient for vs to returne by day a &s;hip|boorde. Wee tooke leaue of them muche to their griefe, but more to ours without compari&s;on, for that wee
<PB REF="45"> had no meane to enter the riuers with our &s;hippe. And al|beit, it was not their cu&s;tome eyther to eate or drinke from the Sunne ri&s;ing till his going downe: yet the king open|ly woulde needes drinke with vs, praying vs verie gently to giue him the cuppe whereout we had drunke: and &s;o making him to vnder&s;tande that wee woulde &s;ee him againe the next day, we retired to our &s;hippes, which lay aboue &s;ixe leagues from the hauen to the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The next day in the morning we returned to land againe, accompanied with the Captaines, Gentlemen, and Souldi|ers, and other of our &s;mall trope: cariyng with vs a Pillour or columne of harde &s;tone, our kings armes graued therein, to plant and &s;et the &s;ame in the enterie of the Porte in &s;ome high place, where it might bee ea&s;ely &s;eene, and being come thither before the Indians were a&s;&s;embled, we e&s;pied on the &s;outh &s;yde of the Riuer a place very fitte for that purpo&s;e, vp|on a litle hill, compa&s;&s;ed with Cypres, Bayes, Paulmes and other trees, with &s;weete &s;melling and plea&s;ant &s;hrubbes. In the middle whereof we planted the fir&s;t bound or limit of his Maie&s;tie. This done perceiuing our fir&s;t Indians a&s;&s;em|bled, not without &s;ome mi&s;liking of tho&s;e on the South parte, where we had &s;et the limitte, who taried for vs in the &s;ame place where they met with vs the day before, &s;eeming vnto vs that there is &s;ome enimitie betweene them and the others. But when they perceyued our long tarying on this &s;ide, they ran to &s;ee what we had done in that place where we landed fir&s;t, and had &s;et our limitte: which they vewed a great while without touching it any way, or aba&s;&s;ing, or euer &s;pea|king to vs therof at any time after. Howebeit we could &s;ka~t depart but as it were w^t griefe of minde fro~ this our fir&s;t alli|ance, they rowing vnto vs all along the riuer from all parts and pre&s;enting vs with &s;ome of their harts &s;kins, painted and vnpainted, meale, litle cakes, fre&s;he water, rootes like vnto Rinbabe which they haue in great e&s;timation, and make ther|of a potion of medicine: al&s;o they brought litle bagges of redde colours and &s;ome &s;mall &s;pices like vnto Vire, percey|uing
<PB REF="46"> among them &s;elues fayre thinges painted as it had bin with graine of &s;carlet, &s;howing vnto vs by &s;ignes that they had in the lande golde and &s;iluer and copper: whereof wee haue brought &s;ome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gold, &s;iluer, and copper in Flori|da. Turque&s;&s;es and aboundance of pearles. Mar&s;hes.</NOTE> Al&s;o lead like vnto ours which we &s;hew|ed. Al&s;o turque&s;&s;es and great aboundance of pearles whiche as they declared vnto vs they tooke out of oy&s;ters, whereof there is taken euer along the riuer &s;ide, &amp; among the reedes, and in the mar&s;hes: and &s;o merueylous aboundance as is &s;kant credible: and we haue perceiued that there be as many and as faire pearles found there as in any countrey of the worlde. For wee &s;awe a man of theirs as we entered into our boates, that had a pearle hanging at a coller of golde and &s;iluer about his necke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pearles as big as acornes.</NOTE> as great as an Acorne at y^e lea&s;t. This man as he had taken fi&s;he in one of their fi&s;hing packs there|by brought that &s;ame to our boates, and our men perceiuing the greatne&s;&s;e therof, one of them putting his finger toward it, the man drewe backe, and woulde no more come neare the boate: not for any feare that he had that they woulde haue ta|ken his Coller &amp; Pearle from him for he would haue giuen it them, for a looking gla&s;&s;e or a knife:</P>
<P>But that hee doubted le&s;t they woulde haue pulled him in|to the boate, &amp; &s;o by force haue caried him away. He was one of the goodlie&s;t men of all the company. But for that we had no lea&s;ure to tary any longer with them, the day being well pa&s;&s;ed, whiche greeued vs, for the commoditie and great ri|ches, whiche as wee vnder&s;toode and &s;awe might bee gotten there, de&s;iring al&s;o to employ the re&s;t of the day with our &s;e|conde aliance the Indians on the &s;outh&s;ide, as we perceiuer them the day before, which &s;till taried looking for vs: Wee pa&s;&s;ed the riuer to their &s;hore, where as wee founde them ta|riyng for vs, quietly and in good order, with newe paintings vpon their face, and feathers vpon their heade: the King with his Bowe and Arrowes lying by him, &s;ate on the grounde &s;trawed with boughes betweene his two brethren, whiche were goodly men and well &s;hapen and of a wonderfull &s;how of actiuities, hauing vpon their heades, one haire tru&s;&s;ed
<PB REF="46"> vpright of heyght, of &s;ome kinde of wild bea&s;t gathered and wrought together with great cunning, wrethed and fa&s;ted after the forme of a Diademe. One of them had hanging a|bout his necke a rounde plate of redde copper well poli|&s;hed, with one other le&s;&s;er of Siluer in the midde&s;t of it, &amp; at his eare a litle plate of Copper wherewith they v&s;e to &s;tripe the &s;weat from their bodies. They &s;hewed vs that there was great&s;tore of this mettell within the countrey, about fiue or &s;ixe daies iourney from thence, both in the &s;outh&s;ide &amp; north|&s;ide of the &s;ame riuers, and that they went thither in their Boates. Which Boates they make but of one piece of a tree, woorking it whole &s;o cunningly and featly, that they put in one of the&s;e boates fifteene or twentie per&s;ons, and go their wayes very &s;afely. They that rowe &s;tande vpright ha|uing their ores &s;hort after the fa&s;hion of a Peele. Thus being among them they pre&s;ented vs with meale dre&s;&s;ed &amp; baked, very good &amp; wel ta&s;ted, and of good nouri&s;hme~t, al&s;o beanes, and fi&s;h, as crabbes, lob&s;tars, creui&s;es, and many other kinde of good fi&s;hes, &s;hewing vs by &s;ignes y^t their dwellings were farre off, and if their proui&s;ion had been neere hande, they woulde haue pre&s;ented vs with manye other refre&s;h|inges.</P>
<P>The night nowe approching, we were faine to returne to our Shippe, very much to our griefe: for that wee dur&s;te not hazarde to enter with our Shippe, by rea&s;on of a barre of lande, that was at the enterie of the Porte, howe be it, at a full Sea there is two fadome and a halfe of water at the lea&s;t, and it is but a leape ouer a &s;urge to pa&s;&s;e this Barre, not pa&s;&s;ing the length of two cables, and then forthwith e|uery where within &s;ixe or &s;euen fadome water. So that it maketh a very fayre hauen, and Shippes of a meane burden from foure&s;core to a hundred tunnes may enter therein at all floodes, yea of a farre greater burthen, if there were French men dwelling there that might &s;koure the enterye as they doe in Fraunce: for there is nothing lacking for the lyfe of man. The &s;ituation is vnder the eleuation of xxx. degrees, a good climate healthfull, and of a good
<PB REF="47"> temperature, merueilous plea&s;a~t, y^e people good, &amp; of a good and amiable nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gentlenes mu&s;t be v&s;ed towards them.</NOTE> which willingly will obay: yea be con|tent to &s;erue tho&s;e that &s;hall with gentlenes and humanitie goe about to allure them, as it is needful for tho&s;e that be &s;ent thither hereafter &s;o to doe, and as I haue charged tho&s;e that be left there to do, to the ende they may a&s;ke and learne of the~ where they take their gold, copper, and turque&s;&s;es, and other thinges yet vnknowen vnto vs: by rea&s;on of the time we &s;o|iourned there. For if any rude or rigorous meanes &s;hould be v&s;ed towards this people, they woulde flie hither and thither through the Woods and Fore&s;ts, and abandon their habita|tions and countreys.</P>
<P>The next day being the thirde day of May, de&s;iring al|waies to finde out harbours to re&s;t in, we &s;et vp &s;aile againe: And after we had raunged the coa&s;t as neere the &s;hore as we could, there appeared vnto vs about &s;euen leagues of on this &s;ide of y^e riuer of May a great opening or Bay of &s;ome riuer, whither with one of our boates we rowed, &amp; there found one entrie almo&s;t like y^t of the riuer of May, and within the &s;ame as great a depth, and as large a diuiding it &s;elfe into many great &s;treames, great and broade &s;tretchinges towardes the high lande, with many other le&s;&s;e, that diuide the coun|trey into faire and great landes and great number of &s;mall and fayre Medowes. Being entred into them about three leagues, wee found in a place very commodious, &s;trong, and plea&s;ant of &s;ituation, certayne Indians, who receiued vs ve|ry gently: Howe be it, we being &s;omewhat neare their hou|&s;es, it &s;eemed it was &s;omewhat again&s;t their good willes that we went thither, for at their cries and noy&s;es they made their wiues and children and ho&s;houlde &s;tuffe to be caried into the Woods: Howe be it they &s;uffered vs to goe into their hou|&s;es, but they them&s;elues woulde not accompany vs thither. Their hou&s;es bee made of Wood fitly and clo&s;e, &s;et vpright and couered with Reedes: the mo&s;t part of them after the fa|&s;hion of a pauilion. But there was one hou&s;e amonge&s;t the re&s;t verie long and broade, with &s;ettles rounde about made
<PB REF="47"> of Reedes trimly couched together, which &s;erue them both for beddes and &s;eates, they be of height two foote from the grounde, &s;et vpon great rounde pillers painted with red, ye|lowe, and blewe, well and trimlie poli&s;hed: &s;ome &s;orte of this people perceiuing that we had in no maner wi&s;e hurted their dwellings nor gardens whiche they dre&s;&s;ed very diligently, they returned all vnto vs before our inbarking, &s;eeming very well contented by their giuing vnto vs water, fruites, and Hart &s;kinnes. It is a place wonderfull fertill, and of &s;trong &s;ituatio~, the ground fat, &s;o that it is likely that it would bring forth Wheate and all other corne twi&s;e a yeere,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great fertilitie.</NOTE> and the com|modities for liuelihood, and the hope of more riches, bee like vnto tho&s;e we found and con&s;idered vpon the riuer of May, without comming into the &s;ea: this arme doth diuide, and maketh many other Iles of May, as al&s;o many other great Ilandes: by the which wee trauell from one Ilande to ano|ther, betweene lande and land.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Note.</NOTE> And it &s;eemeth that men may &s;ayle without danger through al the countrey, and neuer en|ter into the great &s;ea, which were a wonderfull aduantage.</P>
<P>This is the lande of Checere whereof &s;ome haue written, &amp; which many haue gone about to find out, for y^e great riches they perceiued by &s;ome Indians to be founde there. It is &s;et vnder &s;o good a climate, that none of our men (though wee were there in the hote&s;t time of the yeere, the &s;unne entring into Cancer) were troubled with any &s;ickne&s;&s;es. The people there liue long and in great health and &s;trength, &s;o that the a|ged men goe without &s;laues, and are able to goe and runne like the younge&s;t of them, who onely are knowen to be olde by the wrinckles in their face, and decay of &s;ight. Wee de|parted from them verie friendly, &amp; with their contentation. But the night ouertaking vs, we were con&s;trayned to lye in our &s;hips all that night, till it was day, floting vpon this ri|uer which we haue called Sene,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The riuer of Sene.</NOTE> becau&s;e that the entery of it is as broade as from hauer degrace vnto Hone&s;leue. At the breake of the day wee e&s;pied out of the South &s;yde one of the fayre&s;t, plea&s;aunte&s;t, and greate&s;t medowe grounde
<PB REF="48"> that might bee &s;eene, into the which wee went, finding at the very entrie a long, faire, and great Lake, and an innumera|ble number of foote&s;teps of great Hartes and Hindes of a wonderfull greatne&s;&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Heardes of tame Hartes.</NOTE> the &s;teppes beeing all fre&s;h and new, and it &s;eemeth that the people doe nouri&s;he them like tame Cattell in great heards: for we &s;aw the &s;teppes of an Indian that folowed them.</P>
<P>The Chanell and depth of this riuer of Seyne, is one y^t &s;ide of the medowe that is in the Ile of May. Being retur|ned to our &s;hips, we &s;ayled to knowe more and more of this coa&s;t, goying as neere the &s;hore as we coulde. And as wee had &s;ayled about &s;ixe or &s;euen leagues, there appeared vnto us another Bay, where we ca&s;t anker, and tarrying &s;o all the night, in the morning wee went thither, and finding (by our founding) at the entrie many bankes and beatings, we dur&s;t not enter there with our great &s;hip, hauing named the riuer Somme, which is 8. 9. 10. 11. fadome depth, diuiding it &s;elfe into many great Ilands, and &s;mall goodly medow grounds and pa&s;tures, and euery where &s;uch abundance of fi&s;h as is incredible, and on the Wea&s;t Northwe&s;t &s;ide, there is a great riuer that commeth fro~ the countrie of a great length ouer: and another on the Northea&s;t &s;ide, which returne into the Sea. So that (my Lord) it is a countrie full of hauens, ri|uers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good hauens and riuers.</NOTE> and Ilands, of &s;uch fruitfulnes as cannot with tongue be expre&s;&s;ed: and where in &s;hort time great and precious co~|modities might bee found.<NOTE PLACE="marg">7. Great &amp; good riuers.</NOTE> And be&s;ides this wee di&s;couered and found al&s;o vii. riuers more, as great and as good, cutting and diuiding the land into faire and great Ilands. The In|dians inhabitants there be like in manners, &amp; the countrie in fertillitie apt and commodious throughout to beare &amp; bring foorth plentifully all that men would plant or &s;owe vpon it. There bee euery where the highe&s;t and greate&s;t Firtrees y^t can be &s;eene, very well &s;melling, and where out might bee gathered (with cutting the only bark) as much Ro&s;en, Tur|pentine, &amp; Fra~ke~&s;ence, as men would de&s;ire. And to be &s;hort there lacketh nothing. Wherefore being not able to enter &amp; lie with our great ve&s;&s;els there, we could make no long abi|ding,
<PB REF="48"> nor enter &s;o farre into the riuers and countries as wee would faine haue done: for it is well knowne how many in|conueniences haue happened vnto men, not only in attemp|ting of newe di&s;coueries, but al&s;o in all places by leauing their great ve&s;&s;els in the Sea, farre from the land, vnfurni|&s;hed of the heads and be&s;t men. As for y^t other riuers we haue giuen them names as followeth: and vnto the Ilandes ioy|ning vnto them, the &s;ame name that the next riuer vnto it hath, as you &s;hall &s;ee by the portratures or Cardes<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maps and Sea Cardes.</NOTE> y^t I haue made thereof.

<HEAD>What re&s;pect of Ilandes is to be had, and why.</HEAD>
<P>_WHereas the Portingales haue in their cour&s;e to their Indies in the Southea&s;t, certaine portes and fortificatio~s to thru&s;t into by the way, to diuers great purpo|&s;es? So you are to &s;ee what Ilands, and what portes you had neede to haue by the way in your cour&s;e, to the Northea&s;t. For which cau&s;e I wi&s;h you to enter into con&s;ideration of the matter, &amp; to note all the Ilands, &amp; to &s;et them downe in p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">at, to two endes, that is to &s;ay, That wee may deui&s;e to take the benefite by them. And al&s;o fore&s;ee how by the~ the Sauages or ciuill Princes, may in any &s;ort anoy vs in our purpo&s;ed trade that way.</P>
<P>And for that the people to the which wee purpo&s;e in this voyage to goe, be no Chri&s;tians, it were good that the ma&s;&s;e of our commodities were alwayes in our owne di&s;po&s;ition, and not at the will of others. Therefore it were good that we did &s;eeke out &s;ome &s;mall Iland in the Scithian Sea, where we might plant, Fortifie, &amp; Staple &s;afely, fro~ whe~ce (as time &s;houlde &s;erue) wee might feede tho&s;e heathen nations with our commodities without cloying them, or without venturing our hole ma&s;&s;e in the bowels of their countrey.</P>
<P>And to whiche Ilande if neede were (and if we &s;houlde thinke &s;o good) we might allure the Northea&s;t nauie, the na|uie of Cambalu to re&s;ort with their commodities to vs there planted, and &s;tapling there.</P>

<P>And if &s;uch an Iland may be found for the &s;tabling of our commodities, to the which they of Cambalu would not &s;aile, yet we might, hauing &s;hippes there, imploy them in pa&s;&s;ing betweene Cambalu and that &s;tapling place.</P>

<P>The people there to plant and to continue are eyther to liue without trafficke, or by trafficke and by trade of mar|chandize. If they &s;hall liue without &s;ea trafficke, at the fir&s;t they become naked by want of linen and wollen, and very mi&s;erable by infinite wantes that will otherwi&s;e en&s;ue, and &s;o will they be forced of them &s;elues to depart, or els ea&s;ely they will bee con&s;umed by the Sp. by the Fr. or by the na|turall inhabithantes of the countrey, and &s;o the interprice becomes reprochfull to our nation, and a lett to many o|ther good purpo&s;es that may be taken in hande.</P>
<P>And by trade of marchandize they can not liue, excepte the &s;ea or the lande there may yeelde commoditie for com|moditie. And therefore you ought to haue mo&s;t &s;peciall re|garde of that point, and &s;o to plant, that the naturall com|modities of the place and &s;eate, may drawe to you acce&s;&s;e of Nauigation for the &s;ame, or that by your owne Nauigation you may carie the &s;ame out, and fetche home the &s;upplye of the wantes of the &s;eate.</P>

<P>And for that in the ample vente of &s;uche thinges as are brought to you out of engl. by &s;ea, &s;tandeth a matter of great con&s;equence, it behoueth that all humanitie and curte&s;ie and much forbearing of reuenge to the inland people be v&s;ed, &s;o &s;hall you haue firme amitie with your neyghbours, &s;o &s;hall you haue their inland commodities to maintayne trafficke, &amp; &s;o &s;hall you waxe rich and &s;trong in force. Diuers &amp; &s;eue|rall commodities of the inland are not in great plentie to be brought to your handes, without the ayde of &s;ome portable or Nauigable ryuer, or ample lacke, and therefore to haue
<PB REF="58"> the helpe of &s;uche a one is mo&s;t requi&s;ite: And &s;o is it of effecte for the di&s;per&s;ing of your owne commodities in ex|change into the inlandes.</P>
<P>Nothing is more to be indeuoured with the Inland peo|ple then familiaritie. For &s;o may you be&s;t di&s;couer al the na|turall commodities of their countrey, and al&s;o all their wantes, all their &s;trengthes, all their weakene&s;&s;e, and with whome they are in warre, and with whome confiderate in peace and amitie, &amp;c. whiche knowen, you may woorke many great effectes of greate&s;t con&s;equence.</P>
<P>And in your planting the con&s;ideration of the climate and of the &s;oyle bee matters that are to bee re&s;pected. For if it be &s;o that you may let in the &s;alt &s;ea water, not mixed with the fre&s;h into flattes, where the &s;unne is of the heate that it is at Rochell, in the Bay of portingall, or in Spaine, then may you procure a man of &s;kill, and &s;o you haue wonne one noble commoditie for the fi&s;hing, and for trade of mar|chandize by making of Salt.</P>
<P>Or if the &s;oyle and clymate bee &s;uch as may yeelde you the Grape as good as that at Burdeus, as that in Portin|gale, or as that about Siui in Spaine, or that in the Ilands of the Canaries, then there re&s;teth but a woorkeman to put in execution to make wines, and to dre&s;&s;e Re&s;ings of the &s;unne and other, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Or if you finde a &s;oyle of the temperature of the South part of Spaine or Barbarie, in whiche you finde the Olif tree to growe: Then you may bee a&s;&s;ured of a noble mar|chandize for this realme, con&s;idering that our great trade of clothing doth require oyle, and weying howe deere of late it is become by the vent they haue of that commoditie in the We&s;t Indies, and if you finde the wilde olif there it may be graffed.</P>
<P>Or if you can finde the berrie of Cochenile with whiche wee colour Stammelles, or any Roote, Berrie, Fruite, wood or earth fitte for dying, you winne a notable thing fitt
<PB REF="59"> for our &s;tate of clothing. This Cochenile is naturall in the we&s;t Indies on that firme.</P>
<P>Or if you haue hides of bea&s;tes fit for &s;ole Lether, &amp;c. It wilbe a marchandize right good, and the &s;auages there yet can not canne Lether after our kinde, yet excellently after their owne maner.</P>
<P>Or if the &s;oyle &s;hall yeelde Figges, Almondes, Sugar Canes, Quinces, Orenges, Lemons, Potatos, &amp;c. there may ari&s;e &s;ome trade and trafficke, by figges, almonds, &s;u|gar, marmelade, Sucket &amp;c.</P>
<P>Or if great woods bee founde, if they be of Cypres, che&s;ts may bee made, if they bee of &s;ome kinde of trees, pitche and tarre may be made, if they bee of &s;ome other then they may yeelde Ro&s;in, Trupentine, &amp;c. and al for trade and trafficke, and Ca&s;kes for wine and oyle may be made: likewi&s;e &s;hips and hou&s;es, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e trafficke is a thing &s;o materiall, I with that great ob&s;eruation be taken what euery &s;oyle yeeldeth natu|rally, in what commoditie &s;oeuer, and what it may be made to yeeld by indeuour, and to &s;end vs notice home, that there|vppon wee may deui&s;e what meanes may be thought of to ray&s;e trades.</P>
<P>Nowe admit that we might not be &s;uffered by the &s;auages to enioy any whole countrey or any more the~ the &s;cope of a Citie, yet if wee might enioy trafficke and be a&s;&s;ured of the &s;ame, wee might bee much inriched, our Nauie might be increa&s;ed, &amp; a place of &s;afetie might there be found, if change of religion or ciuill warres &s;houlde happen in this realme, which are thinges of great benefite. But if we may inioy any large Territorie of apt &s;oyle, we might &s;o v&s;e the mat|ter, as we &s;hould not depende vpon Spaine for oyles, &s;acks, re&s;inges, orenges, lemons, Spani&s;h &s;kinnes, &amp;c. Nor vppon Fraunce for wood, bay&s;alt, and ga&s;coyne wines, nor on E&s;t|lande for flaxe, pitch, tarre, ma&s;tes, &amp;c. So we &s;houlde not &s;o exhau&s;t our trea&s;ure, and &s;o exceedingly inriche our doubt|full friendes, as we doe, but &s;houlde purcha&s;&s;e the commodi|ties that we want for halfe the trea&s;ure that now we do: but
<PB REF="59"> &s;hould by our own indu&s;tries &amp; the benefits of the &s;oile there cheapely purches oyles, wines, &s;alt, fruits, pitch, tarre, flaxe, hempe, ma&s;tes, boordes, fi&s;he, gold, &s;iluer, copper, tallowe, hides and many commodities: be&s;ides if there be no flates to make &s;alt on, if you haue plentie of wood you may make it in &s;ufficient quantitie for common v&s;es at home there.</P>
<P>If you can keepe a &s;afe hauen, although you haue not the friend&s;hip of the neere neyghbours, yet you may haue traf|ficke by &s;ea vpon one &s;hore or other, vpon that firme in time to come, if not pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>If you finde great plenty of tymber on the &s;hore &s;ide or vpon any portable riuer, you were be&s;t to cut downe of the &s;ame the fir&s;t wynter, to bee &s;ea&s;oned for &s;hippes, barkes, botes and hou&s;es.</P>
<P>And if neere &s;uch wood there be any riuer or brooke vpon the which a &s;awing mill may be placed, it woulde doe great &s;eruice, and therefore con&s;ideration woulde bee had of &s;uche place.</P>
<P>And if &s;uch port &amp; cho&s;e~ place of &s;etling were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;io~ &amp; after fortified by art, although by y^e land &s;ide our Engli&s;hme~ were kept in, and might not inioy any traffick with the next neighbours, nor any vittel: yet might they vittel them&s;elues of fi&s;he to &s;erue verie nece&s;&s;itie, and enter into amitie with the enemies of their next neighbours, &amp; &s;o haue vent of their marchandize of England and al&s;o haue vittel, or by meanes herevpon to be v&s;ed to force the next neighbours to amitie. And keeping a nauie at the &s;etling place, they &s;houlde finde out along the tracte of the lande to haue trafficke, and at diuers Ilandes al&s;o. And &s;o this fir&s;t &s;eate might in time become a &s;tapling place of the commodities of many countreys and territories, and in tyme this place myght be|come of all the prouinces round about the only gouernour. And if the place fir&s;t cho&s;e~ &s;hould not &s;o wel plea&s;e our peo|ple, as &s;ome other more lately founde out: There might bee an ea&s;ie remoue, and that might be ra&s;ed, or rather kept for others of our nation to auoyde an ill neyghbour, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If the &s;oyles adioyning to &s;uch conuenient hauen and
<PB REF="60"> &s;etling places be founde mar&s;hie and boggie, then men &s;kil|ful in draining are to be caried thither. For arte may worke wonderfull effectes therein, and make the &s;oyle rich for ma|ny v&s;es.</P>
<P>To plante vppon an Ilande in the mouth of &s;ome nota|ble riuer, or vpon the poynt of the lande entring into the ri|uer, if no &s;uch Iland be, were to great ende. For if &s;uch riuer were nauigable or portable farre into the lande, then would ari&s;e great hope of planting in fertill &s;oyles, and trafficke on the one or on thother &s;ide of the riuer, or on both, or the lin|king in amitie with one or other petie king conte~ding there for dominion.</P>
<P>Such riuers founde, both barges and boates may bee made for the &s;afe pa&s;&s;age of &s;uch as &s;hal perce y^e &s;ame. The&s;e to bee couered with doubles of cour&s;e linnen artificially wrought, to defend the arrow or the dart of the &s;auage from the rower.</P>
<P>Since euery &s;oyle of the world by arte may be made to yeelde things to feede and to cloth man, bring in your re|turne a perfect note of the &s;oyle without and within, and we &s;hall deui&s;e if neede require to amende the &s;ame, &amp; to draw it to more perfectio~. And if you finde not fruits in your plan|ting place to your liking, we &s;hal in v. drifats furni&s;h you w^t &s;uch kinds of plants to be caried thither y^e winter after your planting, as &s;hall the very next &s;ummer folowing, yeeld you &s;ome fruite, and the yere next folowing, as much as &s;hal &s;uf|fice a towne as big as Callice, and that &s;hortly after &s;hall be able to yeeld you great &s;tore of &s;trong durable good &s;ider to drinke, &amp; the&s;e trees &s;halbe able to increa&s;e you within le&s;&s;e then vii. yeres as many trees pre&s;ently to beare, as may &s;uf|fice the people of diuers pari&s;hes, which at the fir&s;t &s;etling may &s;tand you in great &s;teade, if the &s;oyle haue not the com|moditie of fruites of goodne&s;&s;e already.

<P>This is the forme of a Mappe &s;ent 1527. from Smill in Spayne by mai&s;ter Robert Thorne marchaunt, to Doctor Ley Emba&s;&s;adour for king Henry the 8. to Charles the Emperour. And although the &s;ame in this pre&s;ent time may &s;eeme rude, yet I haue &s;et it out, be|cau&s;e his booke coulde not well be vnder&s;tood without the &s;ame. The imperfection of which Mappe may be excu&s;ed by that tyme: the knowledge of Co&s;mographie not then be|yng entred among our Marchauntes, as nowe it is.</P>
