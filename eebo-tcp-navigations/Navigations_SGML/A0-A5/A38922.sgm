<P>Upon the 10th. the King took a review of the Hor&s;e, and upon the 11th, detach'd away Twelve Squadrons, un|der the Marque&s;s <HI>de la Foret,</HI> Lieutenant General, who pa&s;s'd the <HI>Lys</HI> at <HI>Machelen,</HI> over Three Bridges, with Orders to joyn the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who lay encamp'd with his Army at <HI>Ninove.</HI> The &s;ame day al&s;o the King decamp'd, and to the End he might draw nearer to the Lines, encamp'd at <HI>Rou&s;&s;elare,</HI> over again&s;t <HI>Commines</HI> and <HI>Ypres,</HI> and advanc'd the 13th to <HI>Bekelar,</HI> a League or there|about

Thereupon he forthwith i&s;&s;ued out &s;everal Orders; he caus'd great Numbers of Men to march &s;everal ways, under &s;everal Commanders, and chang'd the Po&s;ts of &s;everal. M. <HI>de Ro&s;en,</HI> who lay at <HI>E&s;chem,</HI> to defend the Line from <HI>Courtrai</HI> to the <HI>Scheld,</HI> pa&s;s'd to <HI>Ypres</HI> to defend the whole on that &s;ide, M. <HI>de Mon|trevel,</HI> was &s;ent to <HI>E&s;chem,</HI> in the Place of M. <HI>de Ro&s;en.</HI> M. <HI>de Cape&s;tan</HI> was appointed to command at <HI>Kenoke;</HI> the Count <HI>de la Motte,</HI> to command at <HI>Ypres,</HI> and M. <HI>de Pra|contal</HI> at <HI>Comines.</HI> M. <HI>de Caraman</HI> commanded to <HI>Ypres,</HI> and M. <HI>Davejan</HI> to <HI>Courtray,</HI> and M. <HI>de Montal</HI> lay next to <HI>Dunkirk.</HI> The Mar&s;hal al&s;o order'd &s;everal Pieces of Ca|non to be planted upon the Ri&s;ing Grounds of <HI>Hollebeck,</HI> where he had rais'd new Works, as having ob&s;erv'd that part to be weaker than any of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>During the&s;e Motions, the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> who lay encamp'd at <HI>Ninove,</HI> departed from thence the 14th, pa&s;s'd the <HI>Dendre,</HI> and encamp'd at St. <HI>Stephens.</HI> The 15th he ar|riv'd at <HI>Ename</HI> upon the <HI>Scheldt,</HI> a League below <HI>Oudenarde;</HI> and the 17th encampt at <HI>Ca&s;tre,</HI> within half a League of the Enemies new Line.

<P>At the &s;ame time that the Elector encamp'd at <HI>Ninove,</HI> the Count of <HI>Athlone</HI> was detach'd from his Army, with Two and Twenty Squadrons of Hor&s;e, and Nine of <HI>Dutch</HI> Dragoons, and &s;ome <HI>Bavarian</HI> Troops, to march toward <HI>Louvain,</HI> and joyn, if it were nece&s;&s;ary, with the Troops

<P>Mar&s;hal <HI>de Villeroy</HI> being inform'd, that the King of <HI>England</HI> drew near the Lines between <HI>Ypres</HI> and <HI>Warneton,</HI> decamp'd from <HI>Cordes,</HI> and march'd all Night of the 13th and 14th. The Foot being led by the Prince of <HI>Conti,</HI> and the Hor&s;e by the Duke of <HI>Bourbon;</HI> and the whole Army encamp'd at <HI>Houthem</HI> in Two-Lines, the fir&s;t all of Infantry, the Second all of Cavalry.</P>
<P>Till the 19th, the <HI>French</HI> wrought hard to &s;ecure their Works rais'd all along the Lines; they al&s;o pre&s;s'd forward the fini&s;hing of the New Works, and di&s;tributed Ammu|nition among the Soldiers. All the care of the <HI>French</HI> having been by the&s;e Motions, to retrench the more &s;afely, and &s;o to order it, that they might not be con&s;trained to come to a Fight; a Proof &s;ufficient that the <HI>Confederates</HI> were Superior to 'em in Number.</P>
<P>Upon the 17th, the King detach'd away the Duke of <HI>Wirtembergh,</HI> with 3000 Men, and &s;ome Artillery, with Orders to advance toward <HI>Kenoque,</HI> to the end he might draw the Enemy that way, and make 'em believe that there was a real De&s;ign upon that Fort: But before they could get thither, there was a Po&s;t that &s;tood in their way, about half a League from the Fort, of which it behov'd 'em to make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters. This Po&s;t was defended by above 400 Dragoons, who were attacqu'd with &s;uch an undaunted Bravery, as &s;urpriz'd the Enemy them&s;elves. M. <HI>de la Motte,</HI> who commanded on that &s;ide, &s;ent a Reinforcement to his own, &s;o that there was brisk Firing on both &s;ides: But at length the <HI>French</HI> were forc'd to give way, and the A&s;&s;ailants made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters both of the Po&s;t, and the Mote on that &s;ide: They al&s;o lodg'd them&s;elves there, and made a Battery of Two Pieces of
<PB N="5" REF="5">Canon in the &s;ame Place. It was the common Opinion, that in this Action, the Duke of <HI>Wirtemberg</HI> lo&s;t about Two Hundred, and the Enemy near Four Hundred Men.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Count <HI>de la Motte</HI> caus'd another Battery to be rais'd in Oppo&s;ition to that which the <HI>Con|federates</HI> had erected, and they began to play one upon ano|ther with great Fury. The <HI>French</HI> al&s;o made all the ha&s;te they could to entrench them&s;elves beyond the <HI>Y&s;er,</HI> ca&s;ting up the Earth before the River, becau&s;e the Moat which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, lay lower than that which was oppo&s;ite to it, the Ground being Mar&s;hy. They were al&s;o Ma&s;ters of part of another Moat, which lay under the Canon of <HI>la Kenoque:</HI> And they &s;helter'd them&s;elves be&s;ides, by means of a Parapet which they rais'd all the length of the Ground which look'd toward the <HI>Con&s;ederates,</HI> and which they cut in two or Three Places, to render the Acce&s;s more diffi|cult.</P>
<P>Upon the 20th in the Afternoon, the Duke of <HI>Wirtem|berg</HI> being &s;trengthned with &s;ome new Reinforcements, <HI>Villeroy</HI> who had notice of it, &s;ent away from the Left Wing of his Army, Eight Battalions, and a Brigade of Hor&s;e, under the Marquis of <HI>Feuquieres,</HI> Lieutenant General. The Night of the 20th to the 21&s;t, was &s;pent in continual Skirmi&s;hes; and there was a Report &s;pread Abroad, that <HI>la Kenoque</HI> was a&s;&s;ayl'd in Military Forms: But that was almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible, and it was &s;ufficiently apparent, that the A&s;&s;aylants had no de&s;ign to do it; but only to draw down all the &s;trength of the Enemy to that &s;ide of <HI>Flanders,</HI> by feigning the Seige of <HI>la Kenoque,</HI> and thereby cau&s;e the <HI>French</HI> to run at the wrong Deer. For it was a mo&s;t difficult Task to pa&s;s the <HI>Y&s;er,</HI> by rea&s;on of the Works which the <HI>French</HI> had ca&s;t up; and there was no attacquing the Fort, without pa&s;&s;ing that River: And though the Confederates had pa&s;s'd it, there lay beyond the broken Bridge, a great Quagmire, with a Road about Thirty Foot broad, wherein the <HI>French</HI> had made &s;everal Entrenchments one behind another. Be|&s;ides, <HI>Montal</HI> commanded with his Volant Camp, from
<PB N="6" REF="6"><HI>Dunkirk</HI> to <HI>Fintelle:</HI> His Forces &s;tretching them&s;elves from <HI>Furnes</HI> to this Place, which is a Con&s;iderable Po&s;t, well fur|ni&s;h'd with Men, becau&s;e that they who would pa&s;s the <HI>Y&s;er</HI> mu&s;t take it before they can come at <HI>Furnes.</HI></P>
<P>While the&s;e things were thus Acting on this &s;ide, the Elector of <HI>Bevaria</HI> lay not Idle. Upon the 17th of <HI>June</HI> the Hor&s;e and Foot had orders to prepare Facines or Faggots to be lay'd before the Regiments. The 19th the E|lector riding with between three and four thou&s;and Hor&s;e to View the Ground about the <HI>Lines,</HI> found that the <HI>French</HI> had po&s;ted them&s;elves at the Mill of <HI>Belleghem,</HI> which is not above half a Quarter of a League from Fort <HI>de Clar,</HI> and the Lines. In this Place were po&s;ted five hundred Foot, and eight or ten Squardrons. Therefore M. General <HI>Fagel</HI> was &s;ent away with &s;ome Troops to make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of the Po&s;t. The On&s;et was Rude and Ob&s;tinate, for they charg'd and return'd to the Charge &s;everal times. But the <HI>French</HI> were con&s;train'd to give way, and retreated into their Lines the be&s;t they could, and in great di&s;order, being clo&s;ely pur&s;u'd by the Confederates. The <HI>Mill</HI> be|ing thus taken, the Victors entrench'd them&s;elves upon the Place, and maintain'd their ground.</P>
<P>By this time &s;ome part of <HI>June</HI> being &s;pent in all the&s;e Attacks, and having &s;ufficiently fatigu'd and remov'd the Enemy at a di&s;tance from the Place where the Attaque was really de&s;ign'd, private Orders were given to the <HI>Branden|burghers,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Athlone,</HI> to the Army of the Elector of <HI>Ba|varia</HI> and the King of <HI>Englands</HI> Forces, to &s;et forward in Or|der to put in Execution the De&s;ign which had been lay'd &s;ome time before. For all this while the Confederates, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> order to what they cheifly propos'd to them&s;elves, had made great Preparations at <HI>Leige</HI> of Great Guns, Ammunition and Provi&s;ion, Pickaxes, Spades, Shovels and other Uten|&s;ils for Seiges, which were conveigh'd by Water down the River <HI>Meu&s;e.</HI> They had got together a great Body of Men compos'd of the Troops of <HI>Mun&s;ter, Cologn, Leige, Bran|denburghers</HI> and others, who were advanc'd as far as <HI>Falai&s;e,</HI> upon the <HI>Mehaigne.</HI> The&s;e were all order'd to march
<PB N="7" REF="6">directly for <HI>Namur;</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Athlone</HI> decamp'd from <HI>Bethlem</HI>'s, tending his march to the &s;ame Place.

<P>In the mean time the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> decamp'd from <HI>Ca&s;tre,</HI> about the 28th at night, and came the next morning to St. <HI>Lievens Hauten,</HI> and the 30th encamp'd at <HI>Ninove.</HI> The 1&s;t of <HI>July</HI> he came to <HI>Hall,</HI> and the next day to <HI>Ma&s;y,</HI> within two leagues of <HI>Namur.</HI> The 3d he made his Approaches nearer to the City, cro&s;s'd the <HI>Samber,</HI> po|&s;ted his Men and took up his Head Quarters in the <HI>Abby de Maloigne.</HI> The Baron of <HI>Heiden,</HI> General of the <HI>Branden|burghers,</HI> who had pa&s;s'd the <HI>Samber</HI> below <HI>Charleroi,</HI> took his Po&s;t next to <HI>Morlaigne,</HI> and &s;ent a Detachment over the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> on that &s;ide next to <HI>Condros.</HI> While the Earl of <HI>Athlone</HI> po&s;ted him&s;elf on this &s;ide the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> with his Caval|ry: And thus <HI>Namur,</HI> upon the 3d of <HI>June,</HI> was inve&s;ted on every &s;ide.</P>

<P>The 29th his Maje&s;ty having left the Army to the Conduct of the Prince of <HI>Vaudemont,</HI> departed with a De|tachment of Granadiers and the Guards of his Body, and took the Road of <HI>Vilvorde.</HI> However ten thou&s;and Men of that Army had orders to march to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> through <HI>Dein&s;e, Gaure,</HI> and <HI>Alo&s;t.</HI></P>

<P>In this Attack, the Be&s;iegers had in all about 300 Men &s;lain out-right, and 400 Wounded. Of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Guards, Lieutenant Collonel <HI>Robin&s;on,</HI> Five Lieutenants, and Two En&s;igns were &s;lain; Colonel <HI>Matthews,</HI> and &s;everal others were wounded.

<P>The &s;ame day, about Two Hours before this de&s;perate Attack, the Be&s;ieged made a Sally upon the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="8">Quarter, but after a &s;harp Conflict, were beaten back, and pur&s;u'd to the very Gates of the Fort near the <HI>Meu&s;e.</HI> The Ene|mies lo&s;s could not choo&s;e but be very con&s;iderable, on the other &s;ide the <HI>Brandenburghers</HI> lo&s;t a Collonel, and &s;ome o|ther Officers kill'd, and had about a Hundred Men kill'd and wounded.</P>
<P>On the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Night following, Major General <HI>Heuke|lom</HI> reliev'd the Trenches; the next Night, Major Ge|neral <HI>Sali&s;h,</HI> and on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> Night, Major General <HI>Ram&s;ey.</HI> And at the &s;ame time, they had &s;everal Bat|teries playing again&s;t the detach'd Ba&s;tions, that were be|tween <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> and St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> Gate, toward which they were making their Approaches with all the &s;peed they could.</P>
<P>While things were thus hotly di&s;puted between the Be&s;iegers and the Be&s;ieged at <HI>Namur,</HI> Mar&s;hal <HI>de Villeroy</HI> well under&s;tand|ing that the Army under the Command of the Prince of <HI>Vau|demont</HI> was very much weaken'd by the &s;ending of &s;everal Detachments to the Siege and other Places, thought he bad now an Opportunity to do a con&s;iderable piece of Service for his Ma&s;ter, by cutting off &s;o con&s;iderable a part of the Con|federate Forces: To which purpo&s;e he drain'd all the <HI>French</HI> Garri&s;ons round about, and having by that means drawn together a Force that was almo&s;t treble in Number to the Prince of <HI>Vaudemont,</HI> he &s;et forward with a full Re&s;olution to fall upon him in his Trenches, in Front, Flank and Rear; confident he had him in &s;uch a Snare, that 'twas im|po&s;&s;ible a Man &s;hould e&s;cape him.</P>
<P>'Twas upon the 10th of <HI>July</HI> therefore, that the <HI>French</HI> Army under <HI>Villeroy</HI> decamp'd from <HI>Pont E&s;canaffe,</HI> and quitted their Lines to attack the Prince, who lay near <HI>Dein&s;e.</HI> Now in regard that the Confederates were &s;o en|camp'd, that the Enemy would have had 'em in Flank, the Prince thought it convenient to alter the Array of his Ar|my, and to po&s;t his Right Wing beyond <HI>Aer&s;eele,</HI> whereas it was po&s;ted at <HI>Dendergem;</HI> and the Left Wing he po&s;ted all along the <HI>Lys,</HI> a little above <HI>Gramme,</HI> whereas before it was po&s;ted at <HI>Zeveren,</HI> near <HI>Dein&s;e.</HI> About Eight a Clock
<PB N="11" REF="8">in the Evening, &s;ome Squadrons of the Enemies, advanced as far as <HI>Dendergem,</HI> and began to charge the Prince's Ad|vanc'd Guards, who retreated between <HI>Dendergem,</HI> and the Front of the Army, according to the Orders they had re|ceived.</P>
<P>The Night following, the Prince order'd a Line to be ca&s;t up, to cover his Left Wing and Main Body, and order'd &s;everal Pieces of Canon to be planted in the prin|cipal Avenues to the Camp. The 14th, between Seven and Eight in the Morning, it was ea&s;ily perceiv'd, that the E|nemies Army began to reach <HI>Denderghem,</HI> making a &s;hew as if they intended to &s;ide off to the Princes Left Wing. In the mean time the Right Wing was &s;urrounded with a Line, as the Left and the Main Body had been environ'd before: But the Enemy made a Halt near <HI>Denderghem,</HI> till about Noon, when their whole Army fil'd along the High-way of <HI>Thielt,</HI> and came to po&s;t them&s;elves within Canon &s;hot of the Prince's Right Wing: And then it was, that the Prince expected a General A&s;&s;ault. But they dur&s;t not venture to attacque him, &s;eeing him &s;o well en|trench'd, and in &s;o very good Order to receive them, the Great Guns being extreamly well dispos'd for that pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Prince having Advice, that the Count of <HI>Montal</HI> was filing along his Right Wing, with a great Body of Hor&s;e and Foot, in order to charge 'em in the Rear, and the Mar&s;hal to attacque him in the Front, for that their Forces were much more numerous than His, the Prince immediately caus'd all the Baggage to pa&s;s the <HI>Scheld</HI> at <HI>Dein&s;e,</HI> from thence to be Convoy'd to <HI>Gaunt,</HI> which was done. Afterwards, he drew off his Artillery from the Batteries, and order'd them to take the &s;ame Road; as al&s;o the Ammunition Waggons, and the Infan|try, in &s;everal little Bodies.</P>
<P>And the better to hinder the Enemy from perceiving his Retreat, the Prince order'd <HI>M. d' Overkirk</HI> to face the Enemy, with all the Hor&s;e and Dragoons of the Right
<PB N="12" REF="9">Wing, and for that purpo&s;e to range him&s;elf in Battel Array, from <HI>Aer&s;eel</HI> to <HI>Vink,</HI> which was done; and after the Artillery, Baggage, Ammunition-Waggons and Foot were got far enough before, M. <HI>de Overkirk</HI> follow'd with the Cavalry and Dragoons, as the Prince had order'd him.</P>
<P>Thus was the Enemy amus'd, notwith&s;tanding they lay &s;o very near, and that the Prince did not begin to march till about Five or Six of the Clock in the Afternoon, and con&s;equently in open Day-light. And this March was per|form'd in &s;o good Order and with &s;o much Speed, that the Enemy dur&s;t not attack the <HI>Con&s;ederates.</HI> Nor had they lo&s;t one Man, but for a Stratagem which the <HI>French</HI> us'd, which was by making u&s;e of Green Colours, to intermix with &s;ome of the Rear guard, and to fall upon Two Bat|talions, and &s;ome Granadeers, before they could get in|to a Lane through which they were to pa&s;s. But the Granadeers, and another Battalion making a Halt, the Enemy was &s;oon repul&s;ed: However this Stratagem co&s;t the <HI>Confederates</HI> 200 Men. The Mar&s;hal enrag'd that &s;uch an Opportunity had &s;lipt out of his Hands, Burnt and Plunder'd the Village of <HI>Wootergen,</HI> where the Prince had his Head Quarters.</P>
<P>When his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain</HI> was inform'd that the Army and the Prince were &s;afe, and what a Brave and Ma&s;terlike Retreat he had made, he &s;ent the Prince the en&s;uing Letter.</P>

<P>But to return to the Siege; after the Attack on <HI>Monday</HI> was over, a Letter was intercepted from M. <HI>Bouflers</HI> to the King of <HI>France,</HI> wherein, after the Mar&s;hal had given him a Relation of the particulars of the Attack, he very much lamented, that it had co&s;t his Maje&s;ty above a Thou&s;and Men, among which he reckon'd the Counts of <HI>Maulevrier</HI> and <HI>Mor&s;tein,</HI> the Marquis of <HI>Monbron,</HI> the Governor of <HI>Cambray</HI>'s Son, Colonel of the Dauphin's Regiment, Two other Colonels, 16 Captains, and &s;everal good Officers and Per&s;ons of Note.

<P>On the 18th of <HI>July,</HI> Orders were given out for Major General <HI>Ram&s;ey,</HI> with Five Battalions of Guards, to Storm an Old Tower that &s;tands below a certain Place call'd <HI>la Bouge,</HI> and the Enemies Works de&s;cending toward the Counter&s;carp; the order of which Attack was thus. The Fir&s;t Battalion of the Fir&s;t Regiment of Guards, a Bat|talion of <HI>Cold&s;treamers</HI> Regiment of Guards, and a Battalion of <HI>Scotch</HI> Guards, were order'd for the Attack upon the Right Hand, toward the bottom. The Second Battalion of the fir&s;t Regiment of Guards, was appointed for the At|tack on the Left Hand, by the Old Tower. At the Head of the&s;e Attacks, march'd a Hundred and Twenty Fu&s;e|liers, who carried Fa&s;cines before them; and the &s;ame number of Granadiers, follow'd by a Hundred Pioneers with Spades, Shovels and Gabions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> On the Right of the Body which advanced on the Right Hand, march'd a Hundred Granadiers, carrying Fa&s;cines before them, fol|low'd by Fifty Pioneers; and the &s;ame Number of Grana|diers was on the Right of the Body on the Left Hand, be|tween the Two Attacks.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="10">
<P>Half an Hour after Six a Clock in the Afternoon, the Signal was given, at what time the Battalions before men|tion'd march'd forward in the appointed Order, with that undaunted Courage and Bravery, which is not to be ex|pre&s;s'd, never taking any notice of the Enemies Firing, which was very thick and furious: For the Fu&s;eliers that were in the Front, advanc'd with their Fa&s;cines to the very Pali&s;ado's, where when they had laid 'em down, they fell a Firing upon the Enemy, while the Granadiers ply'd the Tower and Works, the Battalions in the mean time march|ing clo&s;e after 'em, with their Muskets &s;houlder'd, till they came &s;o very near, that they pre&s;ented over the Pali&s;ados, driving the Defendants from thence, and pur&s;uing them through a wide Place of Arms, to the bottom of the Work.</P>
<P>But the Enemy firing a-fre&s;h from the Counter&s;carp, and a Redoubt that lay on the other &s;ide of a Hollow way, upon the A&s;&s;ailant's Flank, the Lord <HI>Cuts</HI> immediately ha&s;ten'd to &s;econd tho&s;e that were engag'd, with Three Bat|talions of <HI>Titcomb, Stanley</HI> and <HI>Collingwood;</HI> with the Fir&s;t of which, he flew to the lowe&s;t Pali&s;ados, and together with the Guards, a Second time beat back the Enemy, &s;ome into the Water, others where they could be&s;t &s;hift for them&s;elves.</P>

In the mean time, Major General <HI>Ram&s;ey</HI> commanded the Pike-men to carry Fa&s;cines, and rai&s;e a work &s;ufficient to with&s;tand a Musket Shot; and when he had po&s;ted in that Place, the Regiments of <HI>In|golsby, Sander&s;on, Lowder</HI> and <HI>Maitland,</HI> he drew off the re&s;t by break of Day, to the Fir&s;t Parade.

In this Bloody Action, the A&s;&s;ailants both Officers and Soldiers, &s;igna|liz'd them&s;elves to that degree, that 'twas no wonder that they who did more than Men could be thought to do, &s;hould be &s;uperior and victorious over tho&s;e who did no more than only what Men could do.</P>
<P>The chief Officers Slain and Wounded, were Colonel <HI>Robin&s;on</HI> Kill'd, Lieutenant Colonel <HI>How,</HI> and Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Davis</HI> Wounded, of the Fir&s;t Regiment of Guards.

<P>In this Interim, <HI>Villeroy</HI> had laid a De&s;ign to have &s;ur|priz'd <HI>Nieuport,</HI> by means of a Corre&s;pondence which he held with a Per&s;on who had undertaken to deliver the Sluces into his Hands.

<PB N="17" REF="11">they were &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed, that they de&s;i&s;ted from their De|&s;ign, and retreated fa&s;ter than they came, fearing to be &s;wallow'd up by the Waters of the Sluces which the Go|vernor had open'd upon their Approach.

<P>The 25th at Night, the Be&s;iegers po&s;ted them&s;elves at the Foot of the Redoubt of <HI>Pallart,</HI> and about Mid|night, &s;et their Miners to work: Which enforc'd the Ene|my that defended it, to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion by break of Day, being in all Six and Fifty Men, among whom were a Captain, an Engineer, Two Lieutenants, and an En|&s;ign.</P>
<P>Upon the 27th of <HI>July</HI> in the Morning, his Maje&s;ty ha|ving re&s;olv'd that an Attack &s;hould be made upon the Fir&s;t Counter&s;carp of the Town, came into the Trenches him|&s;elf, and after he had given ample and requi&s;ite Orders, more particularly, that all the Batteries as well of the Great Guns as Mortars, &s;hould play without intermi&s;&s;ion upon the Faces of the Ba&s;tion, before St. <HI>Nicholas</HI>'s Gate, and the front of the Counterguard that lay upon the Left Hand of the Ravelin near the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> return'd to his Quar|ters. In the Afternoon, he went again into the Trenches, and about Five a Clock in the Afternoon, the Attack be|gan. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> march'd from the Head of the Trenches on the Right Hand, and advanc'd to the fir&s;t Counter&s;carp that covers the Sluces. All the while the Enemy fir'd thick and furiou&s;ly, and &s;prang Three or Four &s;mall Mines fill'd with Bombs upon the Glacis; neverthele&s;s the A&s;|&s;ailants made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Counter&s;carp, and while they drave the Enemy from their Defences, the Be|&s;iegers made a Lodgment behind 'em upon the Glacis of the Counter&s;carp before mention'd.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the <HI>Dutch</HI> march'd upon the Left Hand, and advancing along the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> fell upon the Ene|my, who defended the Fir&s;t and Second Counter&s;carp in Flank, and in le&s;s than a Quarter of an Hour drove the Be&s;ieged out of the fir&s;t Counter&s;carp, from one end to the

Which done, the A&s;&s;ailants pre&s;ently began to lodge them&s;elves with Wool-&s;acks, Gabions and Fa&s;cines, &s;ome of which unfortunately taking Fire, burnt a part of the Lodgment, made by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to &s;ecure their Left again&s;t the Counterguard of St. <HI>Rocque</HI>'s Ba&s;tion. However the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> defencele&s;s as they were, maintain'd their Ground, and kept the Enemy that were po&s;ted within the &s;aid Coun|terguard in play, till they had made a new Lodgment be|hind the Fir&s;t, which was at length put out. In the mean time the <HI>Dutch</HI> perceiving that the Enemies firing from the Counterguard, very much gall'd the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> mounted the Breach of the Counter&s;carp next the <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> plying the and Enemy with their Granado's, lodg'd them&s;elves upon the Breach of the Counter&s;carp, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had done on the Counter&s;carp it &s;elf; by which means, they kept all the fir&s;t Counter&s;carp, from the <HI>Meu&s;e</HI> to the Inundation. The Enemy all this while kept firing continually with Five or Six Pieces of Canon, &s;everal of the Bullets of which flew near the Place where the King &s;tood; and one of 'em kill'd Mr. <HI>Godfrey,</HI> and took off the Arm of Lieutenant Collonel <HI>d' Eck.</HI> Of the Be&s;iegers, between Three and Four Hundred Men were Kill'd and Wounded in this Action. Nor could the Enemies Lo&s;s but be con&s;iderable, in regard that few of their Men who were po&s;ted in the fir&s;t Coun|ter&s;carp, e&s;cap'd with their Lives; as al&s;o, for that the A&s;|&s;ailants Canon and Bombs, and the &s;mall &s;hot of their In|fantry did great Execution.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, the Elector of <HI>Bavaria</HI> attack'd, and made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of an Advanc'd Po&s;t of the Enemies, between the <HI>Sambre</HI> and the Ca&s;tle-Hill, wherein were lodg'd about Four Hundred Men, be&s;ides a Detachment to guard the Abby of <HI>Sal&s;ine,</HI> and another Hou&s;e that &s;tood near it, Places both very proper for laying a Bridge over the <HI>Sambre,</HI> and to facilitate the Attack of the Ca&s;tle.

<P>Upon the 30th, as &s;oon as Day was broke, the Signals being given, the A&s;&s;aylants fell on in Three &s;everal Places.

But the Granadiers in heat of Courage, pur&s;uing the Fugitive Enemy, ad|vanc'd &s;o far, that they drove 'em from the Counter&s;carp of &s;ome of their &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t regular Works; but not being provided to lodge them&s;elves, they were con|&s;trained to retire to the Ground where they were fir&s;t com|manded to po&s;t them&s;elves, which was a good way within tho&s;e Lines, which were by the Enemy thought &s;o &s;trong, as well by rea&s;on of their Scituation, as of the New Works which they had added &s;ince the Siege, that the Pur|cha&s;e of 'em would have co&s;t much dearer than they did.

<P>No &s;ooner had the Confederates made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Town of <HI>Namur,</HI> which they had bravely and fairly won in a manner by Inches, but the unhappy Tidings ar|riv'd, that <HI>Dixmude</HI> and <HI>Dein&s;e</HI> were both &s;hamefully deliver'd up to the <HI>French,</HI> and the Garri&s;ons made Pri&s;oners of War; the one by the Treachery of Major General <HI>Ellen|bergh,</HI> the other by the perfidiou&s;ne&s;s of Colonel <HI>Ofarrel.

<P>Upon the 12th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> at Night, the Be&s;iegers broke Ground, in order to make their Approaches to the Ca&s;tle, and carrying on their Trenches about 150 Paces before <HI>Cohorn</HI> Fort, toward the <HI>Sambre,</HI> made a very good Lodgment. The 13th they advanc'd their Trenches about 200 Paces farther; and that Afternoon one of the Be&s;iegers Bombs fell into one of the Enemies Magazines, wherein lay about 500 Granados, and &s;ome Powder, which blew up, and did them con&s;iderable Damage. The 14th, the Be&s;iegers continu'd their Works with good Succe&s;s. The Night following, the Enemy made a Sally upon Six Hun|dred of the Be&s;iegers, commanded by Colonel <HI>Seymour,</HI> who were po&s;ted near the Pali&s;ados of the <HI>French,</HI> to &s;ecure the Pioneers that wrought in the Trenches; but the <HI>French</HI> were repul&s;ed, and &s;everal of them Slain, and the Be&s;iegers Works were &s;till carried on a Hundred and Fifty Paces farther. On the Be&s;iegers &s;ide Four Men were Slain out-right, and Twelve Wounded, among whom, Colonel <HI>Seymor</HI>'s Major, and one Captain. 'Twas &s;aid that Mar&s;hal <HI>Bouflers</HI> de&s;ign'd to have taken the advantage of that Sally, and to have forc'd his way out with his Hor&s;e, but that finding the Be|&s;iegers had &s;o well po&s;ted their Troops to receive him, he thought it not convenient to put his De&s;ign in Execution at that time.</P>
<P>The 15th the Be&s;iegers made a new Trench of about Three Hundred Paces in the Plain of <HI>Sal&s;ine,</HI> behind the other which they had rai&s;ed before; and ran a Line from their Lodg|ment, as far as the old Trench at the Foot of the Moun|tain, to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t Sallies. During which time, the Enemy were &s;o thrifty of their Firing, that the Be&s;iegers had only Five or Six Men Wounded.</P>
<P>The 16th the Be&s;iegers advanc'd their Trench in the Plain of <HI>Sal&s;ine,</HI> and enlarged and mended that at the Foot of the Mountain, which had been much endamag'd by the Rain.</P>
<P>The 17th they advanc'd their Trench at the Foot of the Hill, above a Hundred Paces, and carried on that in the Plain of <HI>Sal&s;ine,</HI> in order to meet it. The next Night the
<PB N="25" REF="16">Enemy fir'd thick and three-fold with their Small-&s;hot and Great Guns, and made Two Sallies to di&s;turb the Pioneers; but were pre&s;ently beaten in again; Ten private Soldiers being Kill'd out|right, and a Colonel who commanded in the Trenches, and &s;ome others being Wounded.</P>
<P>Upon the 28th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> about Eleven a Clock at Night, the Enemy made a Sally with about 200 Dragoons Mounted, and 500 Granadiers. The Fir&s;t made an On&s;et upon the Right Hand, with 160 Granadiers, where they were &s;oon repuls'd by the Count of <HI>Ribera,</HI> who was vi&s;iting the Night Po&s;ts. After that, they made an Attack upon the Left Hand, where the Lord <HI>Cutts</HI> had po&s;ted his advanc'd Guards to &s;ecure the Work|men; at what time a Hundred Dragoons came upon Lieutenant <HI>Sutton,</HI> a Lieutenant of Colonel <HI>Seymor</HI>'s Regiment, who being po&s;ted in the Plain of <HI>Sal&s;ine,</HI> with 35 Fu&s;iliers, &s;uffer'd 'em to advance within a few Paces of him, and then di&s;charging all his Fire upon 'em, retreated to his main Body; after which, the Dragoons pre&s;&s;ing hard upon him, he gave 'em a Second Vol|ley; at what time the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Bavarian</HI> Hor&s;e, who were po&s;ted in the Plain of <HI>Sal&s;ine</HI> to &s;econd the Infantry, fell in pell mell with the Enemy, and pur&s;u'd 'em to the very gate of the Ca&s;tle. In which Action, the Enemy confe&s;s'd that they had one half of their Dragoons kill'd, together with the Officer that commanded them.</P>
<P>Upon the 25th, came Letters to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> that His Maje&s;ty having receiv'd Information, that <HI>Villeroy</HI> was upon a full March to <HI>Fleurus,</HI> thought it convenient to leave the Camp before <HI>Namur</HI> to the Conduct of the Elector of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Hol|&s;tein Pleon,</HI> and join the Army commanded by the Prince of <HI>Vau|demont,</HI> taking up his Quarters at <HI>Bone&s;ee</HI> near <HI>Mazy.</HI> The next Day the Enemy made a Halt at <HI>Fleurus,</HI> being joyn'd by the De|tachment from <HI>Germany,</HI> and the other Troops commanded by the Count <HI>de Harcourt.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening of the &s;ame Day, the <HI>French</HI> marched to <HI>Gem|blours,</HI> and &s;eem'd to prepare them&s;elves for a pitch'd Battel, for they le&s;t their Tents, and advanc'd toward the King of <HI>England,</HI> as near as the Ground would permit. Upon which His Ma|je&s;ty drew out his Army, with a Re&s;olution to engage. And
<PB N="26" REF="17">in that po&s;ture the whole Army continu'd all that Day; his Ma|je&s;ty &s;taying in the Field in Per&s;on, from Four a Clock in the Morning, till Eight in the Evening; in which condition the <HI>Con|federates</HI> &s;tood ready to receive the Enemy, whenever they thought it convenient to begin.</P>
<P>And it &s;eem'd that <HI>Villeroy</HI> had either a real intent to relieve the Be&s;ieged, or el&s;e to try what a Bravado would do. For he caus'd &s;everal Pieces of Canon to be di&s;charg'd, which were &s;uppos'd to be a Signal, and which were an&s;wer'd by the Be&s;ieged with Lights from the Highe&s;t part of the Ca&s;tle. In the mean time, the Works before the Ca&s;tle went on very well, and the Canon had made great Breaches as well in the Ca&s;tle as <HI>Coehorn,</HI> in&s;omuch that all the Di&s;cour&s;e was of a General A&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>Upon the 29th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> came an Expre&s;s from his Maje&s;ties Camp to <HI>Whitehall,</HI> giving an Account, That a General Storm had been made upon the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Namur,</HI> that &s;till it held out, which A&s;&s;ault was order'd in the following manner. The Lord <HI>Cutts</HI> was appointed to attack the Counter&s;carp and Breach of the <HI>Terra Nova,</HI> with a Detachment of Granadiers, and 4 Regiments of Infantry. Count <HI>Rivera,</HI> a Major General in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Service, was order'd to &s;torm the <HI>Coehorn</HI> Fort, on that &s;ide next the <HI>Terra Nova,</HI> with 3000 <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Bavarians;</HI> M. General <HI>la Cave,</HI> was a&s;&s;ign'd to attack the <HI>Coehorn</HI> on the Right Hand of the <HI>Spa|niards,</HI> with 2000 <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> while M. Gen. <HI>Swering</HI> attack'd the <HI>Ca&s;otte</HI> with 2000 <HI>Dutch</HI> Infantry, and another Colonel at|tack'd the Lower Town with about 2000 Men more.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> advanc'd with great Order and Re&s;olution, and had gain'd the top of the Breach, forcing their way through Fire and Smoke on every &s;ide; but they found the Enemy &s;o advan|tagiou&s;ly po&s;ted and entrench'd behind the Breach, and the Ground on their &s;ide &s;o very bad, that they could not get Ground in front, but were forc'd to retire.</P>
<P>Count <HI>Rivera</HI> was Slain among the foremo&s;t, upon their fir&s;t Ap|proaches to the <HI>Coehorn;</HI> however the <HI>Bavarians</HI> po&s;ted them&s;elves upon a Saliant Angle of the Counter&s;carp, and kept firing fu|riou&s;ly upon the Enemy, who endeavour'd with great Ob&s;tinacy to di&s;lodge them: In&s;omuch, that when mo&s;t of the Officers of the <HI>Bavarian</HI> Guards were kill'd and Wounded, and that the o|ther
<PB N="27" REF="17">Regiments had &s;uffered great Damage, the Enemy &s;till firing with a more than ordinary Re&s;olution, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who had quit|ted the <HI>Terra Nova,</HI> as not being able to do any good on that &s;ide, &s;econded the <HI>Bavarians</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> under the Command of the Lord <HI>Cutts,</HI> who at the &s;ame time having order'd a Lieutenant of Colonel <HI>Mackay</HI>'s Regiment, with 30 Men, to break through the Pali&s;ados, and attack a Battery of the Enemies; the Lieute|nant executed his Orders with that undaunted Bravery, that he turn'd Seven of the Enemies Canon again&s;t them&s;elves, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant &s;ecur'd &s;ome of their Mines; by which means the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Bavarians</HI> planted their Colours upon the Pali&s;ados, and made a good Lodgment.</P>
<P>In the mean time M. Gen. <HI>la Cave,</HI> with his <HI>Brandenburghers,</HI> and M. Gen. <HI>Swering</HI> with his <HI>Dutch-men,</HI> made each of them Two other Lodgments, of which the Be&s;iegers continu'd in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, and pre&s;ently fell to work to improve them, in order to another A&s;&s;ault; and the Batteries were order'd to play afre&s;h upon the <HI>Terra Nova,</HI> to make the Breach wider, and facilitate a 2d Attack.</P>
<P>In this Action, the Lo&s;s that fell upon the Four <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Regi|ments, who made the A&s;&s;ault, was as follows.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Cutts</HI> Wounded.</P>
<P>Nineteen Commi&s;&s;ion Officers kill'd, and Fifty Four Wounded.</P>
<P>Private Soldiers 339. Slain outright; 682 Wounded; Volun|teers Wounded, Col. <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> Mr. <HI>Thomp&s;on,</HI> Mr. <HI>Stanhope.</HI></P>
<P>Other Advice from His Maje&s;ties Camp at <HI>O&s;tin, Sept.</HI> 1. N.S. gave a farther Account, that during the&s;e Tran&s;actions, the Ene|my appear'd every Day in the Front of the Confedrates Line; that on the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> before, they came with about 70 Squadrons to <HI>Boneff,</HI> extending their Line from that Place, to the Right Hand, near <HI>Perwys.</HI> Upon which, his Maje&s;ty order'd the Confederate Army to move, extending his Right Wing to <HI>Longchamp,</HI> and his Left to St. <HI>Denis;</HI> and leaving a Brigade of <HI>Ma&s;y</HI> to &s;ecure that Po&s;t. The la&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> they appear'd with about Eleven Squa|drons near the Advanc'd Guard, but were &s;oon repuls'd.</P>
<P>The next day his Maje&s;ty having din'd Early, and in the Af|ternoon being upon the Road, returning to the Siege, in order to give Directions for a &s;econd Attack of the Ca&s;tle, was met by an Adjutant &s;ent by the D. of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> to inform his Maje&s;ty
<PB N="28" REF="18" MS="y">that M. <HI>Bouflers</HI> and the Count <HI>de Gui&s;card</HI> had de&s;ir'd to Capitu|late; that they had offer'd at fir&s;t to treat for <HI>Coehorn</HI> Fort alone, but that being refus'd 'em by the Elector, they had agreed to capitulate for the whole.</P>
<P>Thereupon, &s;o &s;oon as his Maje&s;ty was arriv'd, Ho&s;tages were exchang'd, and Propo&s;als brought from the Ca&s;tle to the <HI>Sal&s;ine;</HI> the Enemy in&s;i&s;ted at fir&s;t, that they might have Ten Days time to expect Succour, but that was ab&s;olutely refus'd 'em; for it was plain, that the Enemy had &s;uffer'd very much in the la&s;t A&s;&s;ault, and that they were extreamly di&s;courag'd by their Lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>So that at length upon the 2d of <HI>September,</HI> N. S. in the Morn|ing, the Capitulation for the Surrender of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Namur</HI> was Sign'd, and the Be&s;iegers took the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of part of the Outworks; upon which <HI>Villeroy</HI> began to draw off, and retire with the <HI>French</HI> Army toward <HI>Flerus.</HI></P>
<P>The Sub&s;tance of the Capitulation was,</P>

<P>That the Garri&s;on &s;hould march out with Drums beating, Colours flying, two pieces of Cannon <HI>24;</HI> two <HI>12;</HI> and two <HI>6</HI> Pounders, two Mor|tars, and this upon the 5th In&s;tance in the morning.</P>
<P>That they &s;hould be provided with Hor&s;es and Wagons &s;ufficient for tran&s;|portation of their Equipage, and &s;uch of the Sick and Wounded as are able to depart with the Garri&s;on, and that the Be&s;ieged might leave Officers and Commi&s;&s;aries to take care of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>That no Officers &s;hall be &s;topp'd for Money lent, or Goods deliver'd, provided they give Security, or Ho&s;tages for &s;atisfaction of what they might owe.</P>
<P>That no &s;atisfaction &s;hould be demanded for Hou&s;es demoli&s;hed during the Siege, but that Cattel and Hor&s;es taken in the County of <HI>Namur</HI> be|fore the Siege, &s;hall be paid for.</P>
<P>All Magazines to be faithfully deliver'd up.</P>
<P>All Mines to be faithfully di&s;cover'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P></Q>
