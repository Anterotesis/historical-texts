<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e Your Grace,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_BEing <HI>con&s;cious</HI> to my &s;elf of my own ve|ry great incapacity to render &s;uch an Account as may be delightful
<PB N="2" REF="3">and &s;atisfactory; I am a&s;hamed &s;o unprofitably to divert you from better imployments, and &s;o palpably to di&s;cover my own weakne&s;s in the follow|ing De&s;cription of the City of <HI>Tangier,</HI> and the Territory thereunto belonging: where|in how&s;oever I had rather be|wray my folly in this abrupt Narration, than admini&s;ter an occa&s;ion to be &s;u&s;pected in my readine&s;s to obey your Com|mands; and therefore I pre&s;ume to pre&s;ent to your Grace the&s;e ha&s;ty Notes, re&s;olving to deal truly and impartially, ac|cording to what I have &s;een and ob&s;erved, and what hath been related to me by credible per&s;ons.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="3">
<P>On <HI>Saturday</HI> the 12 of <HI>June</HI> la&s;t, early in the morning, we entred the Pa&s;&s;age into the <HI>Streights,</HI> between <HI>Cape Spar|tel</HI> and <HI>Cape Trafalgar,</HI> in one of His Maje&s;ties Frigots: from the <HI>Cape</HI> to <HI>Tangier,</HI> (the wind blowing fre&s;h from the Land) a mo&s;t odoriferous &s;mell, like to the Fume of Cedar or Ju|niper, entertain'd us; which I conceive to be a mixture of plea&s;ant &s;ents ari&s;ing from the variety of &s;weet Trees and Herbs growing there wild: the Coa&s;t rocky, rugged, and full of Hills, yet very &s;afe for Ships, very green with Gra&s;s and Herbs, and full of Trees. When we came into the Bay
<PB N="4" REF="4">of <HI>Tangier,</HI> there fell a mo&s;t ve|hement &s;torm of rain, which continued an hour, and (as it is &s;aid) was more than was &s;een at that time of the year in any mans memory. Being &s;a|luted with a thou&s;and &s;hots of great Guns from the Mole, the Ca&s;tle, the Forts, and the Ships riding in the Bay, we landed, where we were met by the Mayor and Corporation in their Gowns, and conducted through a Guard of Souldiers from thence to the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Tangier</HI> is in the Latitude of 35 <HI>deg.</HI> 35 <HI>min.</HI> &s;ituated very plea&s;antly about the middle way between the Entrance and the Mouth of
<PB N="5" REF="4">the <HI>Streights,</HI> in a large Bay like a Semi-Circle, in plain &s;ight of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI> being le&s;s than &s;ix Leagues di|&s;tant from it: the weather na|turally very hot and &s;calding, but &s;o temper'd with Fri&s;coes and Breezes both from Land and Sea, that the Air is rendred very tolerable; the Sky alway bright and &s;erene, no Rain (nor hardly a Cloud) being &s;een there for three parts of the year: the <HI>Levant</HI>-wind, (which blows very often and very &s;trong, e&s;pecially during the months of <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t</HI>) as it makes the weather more cool, &s;o, be&s;ides its unkindne&s;s to Ships, it is not very agree|able
<PB N="6" REF="5">to Health; many people, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are sickly, being then faint, and more di&s;-compo&s;ed. The City &s;eems to have been one of the great|e&s;t in the World, which is ap|parent by the old Walls and Ruines, extending S. E. about two miles, as far as old <HI>Tan|gier,</HI> (where &s;tands a heap of ruined Buildings, a plea&s;ant River, wonderfully &s;tored with &s;everal &s;orts of good Fi&s;h run|ning near it, and a large Stone-Bridge over it, but now bro|ken) and &s;tretching N. W. near three miles, and beyond <HI>Teveot</HI>-Hill, (&s;o called from that Renowned Per&s;on the Earl of <HI>Teveot,</HI> who there was
<PB N="7" REF="5">cut off the by <HI>Moors</HI>) and a pret|ty Brook, called <HI>Jews-River,</HI> running about the middle way. I dare not take upon me the part of an Hi&s;torian, or go about to give an exact Ac|count of the Annals of this Place; but only in a few words to deduce the Summary Hi&s;tory of its &s;everal Owners, till it came into the Hands of His Sacred Maje&s;ty, (whom God long pre&s;erve over us, and that City under Him.)</P>
<P><HI>Tangier,</HI> or <HI>Tingis,</HI> was fir&s;t built (as &s;ome &s;ay) by tho&s;e fugitive <HI>Canaanites,</HI> who in the Fields adjoining erected Pil|lars, with this In&s;cription in the <HI>Phoenician</HI> Language, import|ing
<PB N="8" REF="6">in <HI>Engli&s;h, We flee from the face of the Son of</HI> Nave, <HI>the great Robber:</HI> Or, as others, by <HI>Tinga,</HI> Wife of <HI>Antaeus,</HI> &s;lain by <HI>Hercules.</HI> I &s;hall not mention what <HI>Leo Africanus</HI> &s;aith of it, becau&s;e him&s;elf al|lows it fabulous. It was a City of great note and e&s;teem, when the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> con|tended with the <HI>Romans,</HI> and gave Name to all the adjacent Country, but is &s;aid to have been buried by <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> in the Ruines of <HI>Juba</HI> its King; but by <HI>Claudius</HI> (who fir&s;t made <HI>Mauritania Tingitana</HI> a Roman Province) to have been re&s;to|red, and made a Colony, called <HI>Traducta Julia:</HI> From thence
<PB N="9" REF="6">it continued the Metropolis of <HI>Mauritania,</HI> until <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great laid it to the Dioce&s;s of <HI>Spain;</HI> in which condition it continued during &s;ome time of the Empire, until about the year 642. <HI>Suintilla</HI> King of the <HI>Goths</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> added it to his Dominions. So that they &s;eem to err, who report, this City, and its dependant Coun|try, to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Vandals,</HI> invited into <HI>Afri|ca</HI> by <HI>Boniface,</HI> in the Empire of <HI>Valentinian</HI> the third. It continued &s;ubject to the <HI>Goths,</HI> longer than <HI>Spain</HI> did: for though <HI>O&s;man,</HI> the third <HI>Caliph</HI> Succe&s;&s;or of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> con|quered the re&s;t of <HI>Barbavy;</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="7">yet <HI>Tingitana</HI> was &s;till held by the <HI>Goths,</HI> and afforded retreat and &s;helter to the Sons of <HI>Viti|za,</HI> the true Heirs, during the U&s;urpation of <HI>Roderic</HI> the la&s;t King, and al&s;o &s;ome years after his &s;laughter, and the &s;ubver|&s;ion of the <HI>Gothi&s;h</HI> Kingdom in <HI>Spain,</HI> by <HI>Mu&s;a</HI> and <HI>Tariffe,</HI> Lieutenants to <HI>&V;lidor &V;lit,</HI> the <HI>Saracenical Caliph.</HI> The <HI>Moors,</HI> when they held this Town, had here a Publick School or Univer&s;ity, where their Youth were taught Let|ters; as al&s;o an Ho&s;pital libe|rally endowed by <HI>Jo&s;eph a Ben Teifin,</HI> the &s;econd of the <HI>Al|mora Vides,</HI> who founded <HI>Mo|rocco,</HI> conquered <HI>Fez,</HI> and &s;ub|dued
<PB N="11" REF="7">all the <HI>Moori&s;h Roytelets</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> adding this to his large Dominion. Under his Succe&s;&s;ors of the three Races, (the <HI>Almoravides,</HI> the <HI>Almo|hades,</HI> and la&s;tly the <HI>Merines</HI>) <HI>Tangier</HI> was their chief Port for <HI>Spain;</HI> for in this Bay, and that of <HI>Alcazzer,</HI> not far from the Point, did <HI>Alboacen</HI> embarque his Army for <HI>Spain,</HI> confi&s;ting of 400000 Foot, and 70000 Hor&s;e, who were di&s;comfited by the Chri&s;tians at <HI>Salado</HI> near <HI>Tariffa:</HI> by which blow, the power of the <HI>Miramemolins</HI> was &s;o broken, that their Em|pire declined very fa&s;t both in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> their civil di&s;&s;entions al&s;o ha&s;tning their
<PB N="12" REF="8">downfal; in which decay of the <HI>Merin</HI> Family, <HI>Tangier</HI> was de&s;erted by the <HI>Moors,</HI> as mo&s;t of this Coa&s;t was, on the ap|proach of <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> the fifth, King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 1472. who&s;e Succe&s;&s;ors held it with continual Wars, and various Succe&s;&s;es with the <HI>Xeri&s;&s;es,</HI> un|til the year 1669. when it was delivered to that excellent and much-lamented General, the <HI>Earl of Sandwich,</HI> for the u&s;e of <HI>CHARLES the Second,</HI> King of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> But who&s;o|ever de&s;ires a more particular and &s;atisfactory account of the&s;e things, may con&s;ult <HI>He|rodotus</HI> in <HI>Vita Camby&s;is, Proco|pius,
<PB N="13" REF="8">Enagrius, Jo&s;ephus,</HI> and <HI>Bochartus</HI> his <HI>Phaleg, Plutarch</HI>'s <HI>Sertorius, &amp;c.</HI> the Hi&s;tories of <HI>Spain,</HI> written by <HI>Mariana</HI> or <HI>Turquet;</HI> of <HI>Portugal,</HI> by <HI>O&s;orius,</HI> &amp;c. of <HI>Africa,</HI> by <HI>Leo,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>It is certainly a very &s;weet and well-cho&s;en place, at the foot of a very great Hill, on which the Ca&s;tle &s;tandeth, on a Declivity, but yet in&s;en&s;ible, of an irregular &s;quare, and fen|ced with a high, thin, old|fa&s;hioned Wall, (much like to that of <HI>Droghedah</HI> in <HI>Ireland</HI>) having only two Gates, one to|ward the Country, called <HI>Port-Catharina,</HI> a wonderful &s;trong, and well-contrived Entrance; the other to the Sea, called the
<PB N="14" REF="9"><HI>Water-Gate.</HI> The Streets are extreamly narrow, (which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in all pla|ces where the Sun is &s;o much Vertical) which makes the Town &s;eem much &s;maller, and le&s;s con&s;iderable than it is: but were they extended at the rate of the new Streets in and about <HI>London,</HI> it would take up a great deal of Ground, and appear a very large Town. The Hou&s;es are low, and ge|nerally little, with <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Roofs, almo&s;t flat, (which is the cau&s;e that it makes the le&s;s &s;hew) the Walls generally of Stone and Mudd, the cover|ing crooked Tiles, the In &s;ide and Cielings of Slit Deal, or
<PB N="15" REF="9">Pine: There are many of the Officers and principal Town&s;|men, who have fine, large, com|modious, and well-furni&s;hed Hou&s;es and Gardens; and in|deed the Hou&s;es are for the mo&s;t part very pretty and con|venient, hardly any without a little Garden, but extreamly beautiful and delighting, full of &s;weet Herbs, and plea&s;ant Trees, e&s;pecially Vines, which running up upon Pillars made of Stone, and <HI>E&s;paliers</HI> made of great Reeds, (which for that purpo&s;e they commonly Nur&s;e in a corner of the Gar|den, and annually cut down for that u&s;e) all their Walks, and Back-&s;ides, and Spare|places,
<PB N="16" REF="10">are covered and &s;haded with Vines, mightily loaden with excellent Grapes, of di|vers &s;orts, &s;izes, and &s;hapes, and &s;ome very early ripe. The Air, taking one time with ano|ther, exceeding temperate, not &s;o &s;ultry as many times of the day in <HI>Ireland,</HI> nor &s;o &s;harp as many of the nights there. It is ob&s;erved, that the Inhabi|tants here (as of the adjacent Country) are much &s;ubject to &s;ore eyes, which I am apt to impute not to any innate qua|lity of the Air, but to the dry|ne&s;s and continual brightne&s;s of it. New-comers are wel|comed con&s;tantly with &s;trange Bli&s;ters and Pimples, like to
<PB N="17" REF="10">the Small-Pox, which is ge|nerally attributed to the biting of <HI>Muskitoes,</HI> (which are ju&s;t the Gnats in &s;ome parts of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> but a little more pert) and <HI>Chinches,</HI> (which much re|&s;emble <HI>Ticks,</HI> but that they leave &s;o intolerable a &s;tink when they are killed) but I rather think it to proceed from an Ebullition of the Blood, upon change of the Air, it hap|pening mo&s;t &s;everely to &s;uch as drink much water at their fir&s;t coming. There can be no place in the World better accommodated with Water, and the be&s;t that can be ta&s;ted; no Garden in the Town (at lea&s;t on the North-We&s;t-&s;ide)
<PB N="18" REF="11">but hath a Well, and &s;ome many; and in the Market-Place is a hand&s;om large Con|duit, with a very fair Ci&s;tern, and a Cock continually run|ning on each &s;ide: the Water is brought to the Town in mo&s;t admirable and co&s;tly Aque|ducts, made formerly by the Romans, and &s;aid to come from the Foot of <HI>Mount-Atlas;</HI> but where the Pa&s;&s;ages are, no man can di&s;cover, till you come within two hundred paces of the Lines, and there they may be &s;een, curiou&s;ly made of Brick and Stone; and at eve|ry twenty yards, or there|about, a little Well, into which the Gravel, Mudd, or any
<PB N="19" REF="11">other Filth doth fall, and when they are filled, it is ea&s;ie to empty and clean&s;e them. I have often wondred that the <HI>Moors</HI> (&s;uch inveterate Ene|mies and Haters of all <HI>Christi|ans,</HI> e&s;pecially the <HI>Tangerines</HI>) &s;hould forbear cutting and &s;poiling the Aqueducts, or poy&s;oning the Water; till I under&s;tood, that it is a point of their Law and Religion, not to de&s;troy any thing that is made for the natural and ne|ce&s;&s;ary u&s;e of Mankind, (which is the cau&s;e that they &s;o cur&s;e and exclaim on the <HI>Chri&s;tian-Dogs,</HI> when a Party hath been &s;ometime &s;ent out of this Ga|ri&s;on to burn their Corn.) The
<PB N="20" REF="12">Land about the Town is very rich and plea&s;ant, abundantly luxuriant in the production of fine Flowers, (as <HI>Narci&s;&s;us, Crocus, Iris, &amp;c.</HI>) and &s;weet &s;melling Plants, which with &s;o much care and co&s;t are nou|ri&s;hed and reared in the Gar|dens of <HI>Europe;</HI> &s;o that the Hay made there by the Gari|&s;on, is only a wither'd No&s;e|gay of Ro&s;emary, Thyme, Marjoram, Pennyroyal, and other &s;weet-&s;melling Herbs. In the Gardens are very good Pea&s;e, Beans, Artichokes, (A&s;|paragus growing wild in the Fields) Strawberries, Lettice, Pur&s;lane, Cucumbers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but Melons, &s;o plentiful, &s;o various
<PB N="21" REF="12">in the &s;hape and kind, and &s;o delicious, that it cannot be de|&s;cribed to under&s;tanding and belief. The common Fruits of this Place are Apricocks and Peaches, (which I cannot &s;ay are &s;o good as in <HI>England,</HI> and I conceive the cau&s;e to be, that they are Wildings, and not mended by Inoculation) Figgs, which bear twice a year, and Mulberries, (much better) O|ranges, Lemons, Limes, Ci|trons, Pomegranats, Plumbs, &s;ome Cherries, but not worth eating, &s;ome Pears and Apples, but very &s;curvy, (which pro|bably ari&s;eth from the cau&s;e before hinted, that no pains are taken in Grafting;) but the
<PB N="22" REF="13">Grapes are certainly not to be parallel'd in any place of the World. They ordinarily u&s;e Calaba&s;has, a kind of a long Pompion, and Simnels, in &s;tead of Cabbage and Turnips, but they are no way comparable to either of them. The Fields about the Town were hereto|fore much more delightful, when they &s;tood full of O|range-Trees, Lemons, Olives, Pomegranats, Figgs and Mul|berries; but &s;ome time &s;ince, there being no timely provi&s;i|on made for Firing, the Soul|diers were nece&s;&s;itated to cut them down, and burn them, for want of other Fewel. There is a very great and curious
<PB N="23" REF="13">Wood near the Town, green all the year, which I daily &s;aw out of my Chamber-window; and though I did not hold it convenient to take a nearer &s;urvey of it, I was told, by &s;uch as in time of Peace have been in it, that it is a <HI>ravi&s;h|ing</HI> Wilderne&s;s of Oranges, Lemons, Figgs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Scarlet-Oak, and Cork-Trees; and in &s;tead of Bryars and Thorns, <HI>thickned</HI> with Damask Ro&s;es, Groves of Myrtle, Ja&s;emine, and Bu&s;hes of Ro&s;emary.</P>
<P>The Hay-Harve&s;t u&s;eth to be about the middle of <HI>May,</HI> and is compleatly made in two days. Barley and Wheat are cut down in <HI>June;</HI> the Grain
<PB N="24" REF="14">trodden out by Oxen, laid up in Caves, and the Straw kept for Food for Hor&s;es and Cat|tle: And in the Month of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the Stubble through the whole Country is &s;et on fire, partly to de&s;troy the Ver|mine, which otherwi&s;e would become in&s;upportable, and partly to inrich the Ground, there being no other manure u&s;ed. The Sea&s;ons &s;eem to be oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e in <HI>Eng|land</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and quite in|verted: for whereas there from <HI>May</HI> to <HI>All-Hallontide,</HI> the Ground is green, and plea&s;ant, and covered with Gra&s;s, and from thence to <HI>April</HI> dry, white and withered; on the contrary,
<PB N="25" REF="14">all the Verdure and Sweetne&s;s in <HI>Barbary,</HI> rank Gra&s;s, and variety of Flowers and Herbs, is from <HI>November</HI> to <HI>April;</HI> but from thence to <HI>November,</HI> the Ground dry, white, wither'd, and burnt with the Sun; this I mean of the Country, but the Gardens are perpetually green, and produce two Crops in a year of almo&s;t all Garden &s;tuff and Sallads: nay, the Cows, A&s;&s;es, and Hor&s;es, (directly contrary to the u&s;age of <HI>Eng|land</HI>) do live all the Summer upon Hay, and chopt Barley|&s;traw, (which is brought in <HI>Barca-luengos</HI> from <HI>Spain</HI>) and upon Gra&s;s in the Winter. If a Peace were made with the
<PB N="26" REF="15"><HI>Moors,</HI> all manner of Fre&s;h Provi&s;ions would be as good as in <HI>England,</HI> and as plentiful and cheap as in <HI>Ireland:</HI> the Beef and Mutton is not &s;o ge|nerally fat, but as &s;weet and juicy as in any other place: Hens, Chickens, Capons, Gee&s;e and Turkies, are extreamly plentiful, and very good; the Pigeons very large, and very fat; but the Ducks are certainly the be&s;t in the World: for being kept from Puddles and dirty feeding, and fatned with Oatmeal and Pea&s;e, the Fle&s;h of them is quite changed in colour and ta&s;te. I have eaten here Plover, Curlew, and Bu|&s;tard, and very good; the Par|tridge,
<PB N="27" REF="15">though much larger, doth not plea&s;e me &s;o well as tho&s;e of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland:</HI> but here are a &s;ort of Birds about the bigne&s;s of a Phea|&s;ant, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call them, <HI>Pe&s;ones de Campo,</HI> which I mu&s;t commend above all the Fowl that ever I ta&s;ted. In the mean time, no place under Heaven, perhaps, is better furni&s;hed with excellent kinds of Fi&s;h, and great plenty; here are (be&s;ide Soles, Gurnets, Mul|lets, Turbets, Lob&s;ters, Eels, Shrimps, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in common with <HI>England</HI>) Cod-fi&s;h, Bonito's, Old-women, Porgo's, Salmo|netto's, Rock-fi&s;h, Star-fi&s;h, and many other, for which they
<PB N="28" REF="16">have no name. The Ca&s;tle of <HI>Tangier</HI> is &s;ituated mo&s;t &s;ecure|ly and mo&s;t delightfully upon a very high Hill, overlooking the Town, Country, and Har|bour; Fortified, be&s;ide its Foundation, on inacce&s;&s;ible Rocks, by four the mo&s;t regu|lar, high, and well-built Ba|&s;tions that can any where be &s;een; &s;everal excellent, and inexhau&s;tible Wells within it; and is, in a word, to all appea|rance, a place impregnable; all the Store-hou&s;es of Ammu|nition and Provi&s;ion, many Hou&s;es, Streets and Gardens contained within it, and very near the third part of as much Ground as is in the whole City,
<PB N="29" REF="16">being divided from it by a Wall that reacheth to the Sea. The Upper-Ca&s;tle, or the Go|vernours Hou&s;e, is very noble, large and commodious, and owes its beauty and conveni|ences to the care and genero|&s;ity of that excellent Per&s;on, the Earl of <HI>Middleton,</HI> late Go|vernour, and doth afford a mo&s;t incomparable Pro&s;pect, all Ships that pa&s;s to or from the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> &s;ailing un|der the &s;ight of the Windows: out of <HI>Foraging-Port,</HI> the Gate that looks to the Sea, an even, plain, and very plea&s;ant Walk leads to <HI>Charles Fort,</HI> a &s;trong and well fortified Place, and Commanded by Captain
<PB N="30" REF="17"><HI>Charles Daniel,</HI> who&s;e Inge|nuity I mu&s;t not forget, that hath &s;o curiou&s;ly beautified the Fort, without impairing the Strength, having on one &s;ide made a mo&s;t delightful Walk between the Wall and the Graft, about twelve foot wide, and near two hundred yards long, curiou&s;ly Gravelled, and covered clo&s;e with Vines, which run up upon Pillars, and afford a cool &s;hade on the hot|te&s;t day. On another &s;ide he hath his Melon-Gardens, and not far from thence his Garden for Flowers and Herbs; &s;o that <HI>Charles Fort,</HI> which is the great terrour to the <HI>Moors,</HI> and which they dare not come near, is
