<HEAD>A true report and De&s;cription of the taking of the Iland and Towne of S. Maries, by a &s;hip of Am&s;terdam and foure Engli&s;h Pinna&s;&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>_AFter that the great and mightie fleet, &s;et forth and furni&s;hed by the vnited Prouinces (in the yeare of our Lord 1599.) again&s;t the king of <HI>Spaine</HI> and his countries, vn|der the conduct and command of the noble Lord <HI>Peter van Does,</HI> Admirall and Generall of the &s;ame, had &s;et &s;aile, and put them&s;elues forwards on their no le&s;&s;e va|liant then &s;ucce&s;full voyage (which God with his omnipotent hand alwaies vouch&s;afeth to guide and protect in all their lawfull attemptes:) it &s;o chanced, that vpon the 10. of Iune, there &s;trayed from the fleete, a &s;hip of <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> wherein was Captaine <HI>Garret Iohn&s;on Cater,</HI> who in cro&s;&s;ing to and fro, to recouer a &s;ight of the fleet, for about the &s;pace of three weekes, happened vpon the fir&s;t of Iuly to di&s;crie neere vnto the Iland of Saint <HI>Mary</HI> foure &s;mall &s;ailes, which afterwards he perceiued to be foure &s;mall Engli&s;h Pinna&s;&s;es, whereof the bigge&s;t was of the burthen of thirtie la&s;tes, the le&s;|&s;er about &s;eauen la&s;tes, and the other two accor|dingly. Being all the&s;e four Pinna&s;&s;es together furni&s;hed with nine ca&s;t pieces, and could make out among&s;t them one hundred men, (when that they
<PB REF="3"> knew them to be all friends, and that the Captains had beene aboard one of the other) after their mutu|all greetings and welcomes v&s;ed at &s;ea, the En|gli&s;h Captaines gaue Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">taine <HI>Cater</HI> intelligence, how that they lay in waite for a barke lying vnder <HI>S. Maries</HI> Iland, which they &s;aid was rich<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">y laden, contayning a great trea&s;ure, and that with his aid and help they might ea&s;ily take her. Whereupon the &s;aid <HI>Cater</HI> promi&s;ed them his good helpe, and furtherance to fetch the barke from the &s;hoare, if &s;o it were, that by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance they might take her: but it was told him by the Captaine of the greater Pinna&s;&s;e that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to take the barke, without that fir&s;t they tooke the Iland it &s;elfe. Whereupon after deliberation taken with them (being able to furni&s;h out in al, nine &s;core men, which the &s;aid Captaine &s;aid would &s;uffice to take the Iland) they re&s;olued to a&s;&s;ault the &s;ame with their men. And hauing made the &s;aide Captaine <HI>Cater</HI> their Admirall, they altogether bended their cour&s;e towardes the Iland, and the &s;ame day en|tred vnder the towne, preparing them&s;elues to giue the a&s;&s;ault the next day.</P>
<P>The &s;econd of Iuly, being the vi&s;itation of the ble&s;&s;ed virg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">n <HI>Marie,</HI> they &s;hot very &s;trongly with foure gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">at peeces out of Captaine <HI>Caters</HI> &s;hip vp|on the towne of <HI>S. Marie:</HI> meane while the men be|gan to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">owed a &s;hore, being all well appointed and prepared to skirmi&s;h, taking their cour&s;e Ea&s;t|wards to the Iland, to fal vpon the &s;ame in the low ground, but they could not doe it, by rea&s;on of the
<PB REF="3"> great number of the inhabitantes vpon the &s;hoare, which ea&s;ily might haue hindered their landing. Wherefore Captaine <HI>Cater</HI> after due con&s;iderati|on thought it requi&s;ite to &s;ende two of the Engli&s;h pinna&s;&s;es, with eight or ten men towards the we&s;t &s;ide of the &s;aid Iland, the which with plying vp and downe, &s;hould &s;eeme to a&s;&s;ault the Iland on that &s;ide, him&s;elfe going al&s;o in his boate, with &s;ome of his men, rowing towards the We&s;t &s;ide of the Iland: whereupon they were &s;hot at by &s;ome Spani&s;h &s;oldiers with Mu&s;kets, which lay there vpon the flat land, and afterwardes the &s;ame day they &s;hot mightily with a great peece vpon the pin|na&s;&s;es, all which was done to that ende, that the &s;oldiers which were occupied on the We&s;t &s;ide of the Iland, &s;hould not withdraw them&s;elues to the Ea&s;t &s;ide thereof to re&s;i&s;t their a&s;&s;ault there: which otherwi&s;e without doubt th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">y would haue done.</P>
<P>Our men now being landed in the Ea&s;t part of the Iland, after a &s;mall skirmi&s;h and little trou|ble, (by Gods help) wonne the Iland: for the Spa|niardes on the Ea&s;t &s;ide being a&s;&s;aulted &s;uddenly and vnlooked for, fled immediately: &s;o that our men tooke not onely the aboue named barke, but al&s;o had the whole Iland and the Towne to their will and di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Which done, the &s;aid Captaine <HI>Cater</HI> by adui&s;e of the Engli&s;h Captaines, &s;et a ran&s;ome on the I|land, commanding the chiefe inhabitants thereof to bring them a certaine &s;umme of Duckets.</P>
<P>Vpon the 4. of Iuly they for&s;ooke the Iland a|gaine,
<PB REF="4"> becau&s;e there was no good roade to ride in, as al&s;o becau&s;e that the We&s;terly winde began to ri&s;e &s;trongly from the &s;hore, &s;o that they &s;hould haue beene in &s;ome perill if they had &s;tayed.</P>
<P>Thus was the Ilande and Towne of S. <HI>Ma|ries</HI> wonne and taken, after they had lyen there three daies.</P>
<P>They might wel haue kept the &s;ame, if they had thought it to haue beene any thing aduantagious, or profitable for them.</P>
<P>The chiefe of the Iland being by them deman|ded what the rea&s;on was that &s;o lightly they yeel|ded the Iland: aun&s;wered, that they knew God was di&s;plea&s;ed with them, that hee would puni&s;h them for their &s;ins, and that therfore they thought it in vaine to re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>To the Almightie God be infinit prai&s;es for this and many other victories graunted vnto vs, and be it his ble&s;&s;ed will to continue the &s;ame, and to ble&s;&s;e all our lawful enterpri&s;es, to the prai&s;e, honor, and glorie of his holy name, and the &s;aluation of our &s;oules.</P>
