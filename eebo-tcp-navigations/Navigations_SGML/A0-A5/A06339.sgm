there any great or solemne mention

the conquest of rude and barbarous

<HEAD>&leaf; The Translator to the

<P><HI>_I</HI> Finde it true, that <HI>Sophocles</HI> writeth
in his <HI>Whipp-bearer Aiax,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">:
Labor labori laborem
adfert, <HI>that is to say, Labour doth
breede labour vpon labour.</HI> For
after that the translation of the Booke,
contayning the Warres betweene the
<HI>Turkes</HI> and <HI>Persians</HI> written by <HI>Iohn-Thomas Minadoi</HI>
was published, diuers of my friends haue earnestly moued me
to be still doing somewhat, and to help our <HI>English Nation,</HI>
that they might knowe and vnderstand many things, which
are common in other languages, but vtterly concealed from
this poore <HI>Island.</HI> I haue aunswered some of these my friends
to their good satisfaction, and told them, that the weakenesse
of my body would not suffer me to sit long, that the houres of
my leasure were not many, vnlesse I should vnduetifully de|fraude
those to whome I am most beholden and bounden, of
that duty and attendance which I owe vnto them: and
lastly, that I had no great pleasure to learne or informe my
selfe of the state of other <HI>Nations,</HI> because I do not as yet suf|ficiently
know the Estate of mine owne <HI>Countrey.</HI> Whereof
(I am verily perswaded) I may iustly auouch that which <HI>V|lysses</HI>
protested of his <HI>Ithaca:</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">.
<HI>Then which poore Countrey
can I neuer see any sweeter.</HI> Among others that made


<PB REF="6">
these <HI>Motions</HI> vnto me,<NOTE PLACE="marg">M. R. Hack|luyt.</NOTE> one there was, who being a curious
and a diligent searcher and obseruer of Forreine aduentures
and aduenturers, as by his good paines appeareth, came vnto
me to the house of a graue and learned <HI>Prelate</HI> in <HI>Suffolke,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">M. H. Castel|ton.</NOTE>
where I lay in my returne out of <HI>Norffolke,</HI> and there made
the like request vnto me, and I the like answere vnto him.
But it would not satisfie him: for he sayd it was an answere
answerelesse, and it should not serue my turne. And presently
presented me with this <HI>Portingall Pilgrime</HI> lately come to
him out of the <HI>Kingdome</HI> of <HI>Congo,</HI> and apparrelled in an
<HI>Italian vesture:</HI> intreating me very earnestly, that I would
take him with me, and make him <HI>English:</HI> for he could re|port
many pleasant matters that he sawe in his <HI>pilgrimage,</HI>
which are indeed vncouth and almost incredible to this part
of <HI>Europe.</HI> When I sawe there was no remedie, I yeelded,
and euen (as the Poet saith) <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Homer.</NOTE> I brought
him away with mee. But within two houres conference, I
found him nibling at two most honourable Gentlemen of
<HI>England,</HI> whome in plaine tearmes he called <HI>Pirates:</HI> so
that I had much adoo to hold my hands from renting of him
into many mo peeces, then his <HI>Cosen Lopez</HI> the <HI>Doctor</HI>
was quartered. Yet <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>My second wits</HI>
stayed me, and aduised me, that I should peruse all his <HI>Report,</HI>
before I would proceede to execution: which in deede I did.
And, because I sawe that in all the rest of his behauiour hee
conteyned himselfe very well and honestly, and that he vsed
this lewd speech, not altogether <HI>exanimo,</HI> but rather <HI>ex vi|tio
gentis,</HI> of the now-inueterate hatred, which the <HI>Span|yard</HI>
and <HI>Portingall</HI> beare against our <HI>Nation,</HI> I was so
bold as to pardon him, and so taught him to speake the <HI>Eng|lish
toung.</HI> In which language, if you will vouchsafe to heare
him, hee will tell you many notable obseruations of diuers


<PB REF="7">
<HI>Countreys</HI> and <HI>peoples</HI> inhabiting in <HI>Africa,</HI> whose
Names haue scarse been mentioned in <HI>England.</HI> As namely,
the <HI>Kingdome</HI> of <HI>Congo,</HI> with all the <HI>Prouinces</HI> thereof,
the <HI>Kingdome</HI> of <HI>Angola,</HI> the <HI>Kingdome</HI> of <HI>Loango,</HI>

with the three great <HI>Empyres</HI> of <HI>Monomotapa,</HI> of
<HI>Moenemugi,</HI> and of <HI>Prete-Gianni.</HI> He will tell you the
seuerall <HI>Rites</HI> and <HI>Customes,</HI> the <HI>Climates</HI> and <HI>Tem|peratures,</HI>
the <HI>Commodities</HI> and <HI>Traffiques,</HI> of all these
<HI>Kingdomes.</HI> He will tell you the sundry kinds of <HI>Cattell,
Fishes</HI> and <HI>Fowles, strange Beasts,</HI> and <HI>Monstrous Ser|pents,</HI>
that are to be found therein: For <HI>Africa</HI> was alwayes
noted to be a fruitfull Mother of such fearefull and terrible
<HI>Creatures.</HI> He will tell you of great <HI>Lakes,</HI> that deserue the
name of <HI>Seas:</HI> and huge <HI>Mountaynes</HI> of diuers sorts, as for
example, <HI>Mountaines scorched with heat, Mountaines</HI>
of <HI>Snow</HI> proceeding of colde, <HI>Mountaynes</HI> of the <HI>Sunne,
Mountaynes</HI> of the <HI>Moone, Mountaynes</HI> of <HI>Christall,
Mountaynes</HI> of <HI>Iron, Mountaynes</HI> of <HI>Siluer,</HI> and <HI>Moun|taynes</HI>
of <HI>Golde.</HI> And lastly, he will tell you the <HI>Originall
Spring</HI> of <HI>Nilus,</HI> and the true cause of the yerely increase
thereof. In any of these poynts, if his Mouth shall happen to
runne ouer (as I hope, much it doth not) you must needes
beare with him, for he will challenge the priuilege of the
<HI>English</HI> Prouerbe, <HI>A Traueller may lye by authoritie,</HI>
and the old <HI>Greeke Agnomination,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">,
<HI>Euery Pilgrime is not a Sooth-sayer.</HI></P>
<P>But to leaue this long <HI>Allegorie,</HI> which indeede is meant
of this Booke, and to come seriously and briefly to certaine


<PB REF="7">
faults, that some Readers may peraduenture finde therein, I
will do my best indeuor to satisfie them in such obiections as
may be made. And first, they will except perhaps against the
<HI>Methode</HI> of the <HI>Author,</HI> because he keepeth no continuate
<HI>Order</HI> in this <HI>Report,</HI> but leapeth from one <HI>Matter</HI> to ano|ther,
without any coherence, like <HI>Marots Poeme,</HI> called <HI>Du
Coqual' Asne:</HI> and so maketh a <HI>Hotchpot</HI> of it. But herein
<HI>Pigafetta</HI> is not greatly to be blamed, who gathering this
<HI>Report</HI> out of the tumultuarie Papers of <HI>Lopez,</HI> and from
his vnpremeditated speeches, vttered by mouth at seuerall
times, could not so well reduce it into so exact a forme and
<HI>Methode,</HI> as curious wits do require. He is rather to be com|mended,
that hauing so rude and vndigested a <HI>Chaos</HI> to
worke vpon, he could frame so handsome a little world of it as
this is. If happily it be further vrged, that the Translator
should haue taken paines to cast him in a new <HI>Mould,</HI> and to
make his members hang proportionably one vpon another:
I must answere, that I neither do, nor euer did like of that
kinde of course. I was alwayes of this opinion (and therein I
do still dwell) that <HI>Authors</HI> should be published in the same
<HI>Order,</HI> in the same <HI>Termes,</HI> &amp; in the same <HI>Stile</HI> which they
themselues vsed. For how know I, what moued them to ob|serue
this <HI>Order</HI> or that <HI>Order,</HI> and to make choyce of one
word rather then of another? peraduenture the reason of
their so doing might proue to be so strong, as I doubt it would
not easily be ouerthrowne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Style.</NOTE> And touching <HI>Style,</HI> some are
so scrupulous and so nice, that they cannot abide to haue old
and auncient Writers to be published in <HI>Latin,</HI> vnlesse they
do imitate one of the <HI>Triumuiri</HI> of the <HI>Latin</HI> toung, <HI>Cicero,
Caesar</HI> or <HI>Salust.</HI> If all men should be of that humour, we
should be bereaued both of singular <HI>Diuinitie,</HI> and antique
<HI>Historie,</HI> which haue been written by men of no great lear|ning,


<PB REF="8">
as <HI>Monkes</HI> and <HI>Friers,</HI> whome (though they were
very simple and meane, yet) it pleased God in the times of
ignorance, to vse as meanes to preserue vnto vs those <HI>Mo|numents</HI>
of <HI>Antiquitie.</HI> And therefore I could wish, that
they might be published in their owne <HI>Style,</HI> and (as it were)
in <HI>Puris Naturalibus,</HI> yea though they write false <HI>Latin,</HI>
as some of them do. On the other side, some of our <HI>Critikes</HI>
are so <HI>Criticall</HI> and so audacious, that when they publish any
of the foresayd <HI>Triumuiri,</HI> or any other <HI>Classicall Author,</HI>
they will transpose, and omit, and foyst into the <HI>Text</HI> many
words and many <HI>conceytes,</HI> whereof the <HI>Author</HI> neuer
dreamed, as <HI>Eustathius</HI> and <HI>Seruius</HI> haue done vpon <HI>Ho|mer</HI>
and <HI>Virgill.</HI> But if algates some <HI>Enthusiasme</HI> haue
come vpon our <HI>Critikes,</HI> that hath reuealed vnto them <HI>tan|quam
ex antro Trophonij,</HI> the certaintie of the <HI>Authors</HI>
writing and meaning, to be such as they haue confidently set
downe, let me be bold to intreate them, that they would muster
their conceytes in the <HI>Margine</HI> (if the <HI>Margine</HI> will hold
them: as I doubt it will not in this <HI>Hypercriticall</HI> world)
or else that they would reiect them (as some of them haue
done) to the later end of their publications, vnder the title of
<HI>Corrections, Castigations, Emendations, Animaduer|sions,
Variae Lectiones,</HI> or such like, <HI>Vt suo quisque v|tatur
iudicio &amp; sensu abundet,</HI> That euery man may vse
his owne iudgment, and abound in his owne sense. But <HI>Male|dicta
Glossa quae corrumpit Textum. Cursed be that
Glosse that corrupteth the Text.</HI> And sory I am, that
some of our later <HI>Diuines</HI> haue erred in this point, euen in
translating the <HI>Holy Scripture.</HI></P>
<P>Another exception may be taken against the <HI>Paradoxes</HI>
that are maintayned in this <HI>Treatise,</HI> As namely, contrary
to the opinion of the old world, and of the auncient <HI>Philoso|phers,


<PB REF="8">
That the two Zones, Torrida, and Frigida, are
both habitable and inhabited.</HI> But hereunto if the <HI>Au|thors</HI>
reasons here alleaged do not sufficiently answere, I do
referre them, that will not yeeld therein, to the excellent
Treatise of <HI>Iosephus a-Costa, de Natura Noui Orbis,</HI>
printed this last yeare, and composed by him in <HI>Anno</HI> 1584.
in which <HI>Theologicall</HI> and <HI>Philosophicall</HI> worke, he doth
at large both by good reasons and also by his owne experience
proue this his position to be true. And therefore I protest vn|to
you, it was one of the chiefe <HI>Motiues,</HI> which moued me to
translate this <HI>Report,</HI> to the end it might be more publikely
knowen, that it was not the single fancie of one man, touching
the temperature of these two <HI>Zones,</HI> but also of diuers others
that by their owne trauell haue tryed the certayntie thereof:
among whome, this <HI>Lopez</HI> was one, who deliuered this <HI>Re|lation</HI>
in <HI>Anno</HI> 1588, being foure yeares after the <HI>Treatise</HI>
made by <HI>Iosephus-a-Costa.</HI> And I do not doubt, but that
within few yeares you shall haue it confirmed by many others
that are and haue been trauellers, who haue not as yet publi|shed
their knowledge and trials in this behalfe. In the meane
time we do great iniurie to them that haue been alreadie so
desirous to acquaint vs with their labours, and to make vs
know as much as they know vpon their credites and honesties:
when in stead of shewing our selues thankefull vnto them for
the same, we skoffe and mocke at them, and confidently sweare
that they are lyers, and opposite to all auncient <HI>Philoso|phers.</HI>
But in a word, I will answere herein with an Argu|ment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rhetoric&punc; lib. 2.</NOTE>
which <HI>Aristotle</HI> vseth, <GAP DESC="foreign">. i. <HI>Siquidem in vsu est hominibus,
mentiri id quod credibile: existimare oportet &amp; con|trarium,
Incredibilia multa hominibus, contingere


<PB REF="9">
vera:</HI> which for the better vnderstanding I must paraphrase
in <HI>English:</HI> If it be an vsuall thing among men, that when
a thing is reported, which is very credible and like to be true,
yet afterwards it falleth out to be a starke lye: Then must we
needes thinke on the contrary, That many Reports or things
which are incredible, do in the end fall out to be true. In
which case, as <HI>Credulitie</HI> leaneth a little to <HI>Foolerie,</HI> so
<HI>Incredulitie</HI> smelleth somewhat of <HI>Atheisme.</HI></P>
<P>Another Paradox is, <HI>That the heate of the Sunne
is not the cause of Whitenesse or Blacknesse in the
Skinnes of men.</HI> This <HI>Position</HI> in the <HI>Negatiue</HI> he may
safely defend against all <HI>Philosophers,</HI> by vertue of the rea|sons
that he hath vouched in this <HI>Report,</HI> which in deede do
vtterly ouerthrow their <HI>Affirmatiue.</HI> But because neither
any auncient Writer before this age, nor he himselfe, hath
euer been able to declare the true cause of these colours in hu|mane
bodies, very honestly and modestly he leaueth it vnde|cided,
and referreth it to some secret of Nature, which hi|therto
hath been knowne to God alone, and neuer as yet reuea|led
to man. And therefore I do wish, that some sound <HI>Natu|rall
Philosopher,</HI> such as <HI>Fernelius</HI> that wrote <HI>De abdi|tis
rerum causis,</HI> or as <HI>Leuinus Lemnius de Occultis
Naturae miraculis,</HI> or as <HI>Franciscus Valesius de Sacra
Philosophia,</HI> would enter into the <HI>Closet</HI> of <HI>Contempla|tion,</HI>
to finde out the true <HI>Naturall</HI> cause thereof. In the
meane while I hold still with my <HI>Author</HI> in the <HI>Negatiue.</HI></P>
<P>The third <HI>Paradoxe</HI> touching the <HI>Amazones</HI> mentio|ned
in this booke, I do not see, why it should be counted a <HI>Pa|radox</HI>
to beleeue, that there is such a <HI>Nation,</HI> considering
how many <HI>Authors</HI> both <HI>Greeke</HI> and <HI>Latine,</HI> both <HI>Histo|riographers</HI>
and <HI>Cosmographers,</HI> both <HI>Diuine</HI> and <HI>Pro|phane,</HI>
haue acknowledged that <HI>Nation,</HI> and the <HI>Coun|trey</HI>


<PB REF="9">
wherein it inhabited. But our new Writers say, that
a little after <HI>King Alexanders</HI> death it was vtterly ouer|throwne
and quite extinguished. What? <HI>Vsque ad vnam?</HI>
not one of them left aliue? Certainely that depopulation must
needes proceede, either from the peculiar visitation of God al|mighties
owne hand, or else it was the strangest slaughter that
euer was heard of, that of a whole <HI>Nation,</HI> being so populous
as that was, there should not remaine some few, that escaped.
But yet suppose that some <HI>Hypsiphile,</HI> or <HI>Penthesilea,</HI> or
<HI>Thalestris,</HI> or some such other, did wisely conueigh hir selfe
away, <HI>cum Dijs Penatibus, cum Matre, &amp; cum filia,</HI>
and being guided by some happie <HI>Venus,</HI> arriued in a farre
remote <HI>Region,</HI> and there obserued the customes and fashions
of their owne <HI>Natiue Countrey:</HI> Might not these three,
together with some other women that were desirous of Rule
and gouernment, and allured by them to be of their <HI>Socie|tie;</HI>
might not they (I say) in processe of time, (for it is a long
time since <HI>Alexander</HI> died) breede a <HI>New Nation</HI> of <HI>A|mazones,</HI>
although we neuer heard, in what <HI>Climate</HI> they
remained? Yea it may be for any thing that I know, this latter
generation might growe againe to be so populous, that they
could send foorth <HI>Colonies</HI> from them into other places, and
so plant themselues in diuers <HI>Countreys.</HI> For I heare that
there are of them about <HI>Guiana,</HI> and heere in this <HI>Report</HI>
I reade that some of them serue in the warres of the <HI>King</HI> of
<HI>Monomotapa.</HI> And I hope that in good time, some good
<HI>Guianian</HI> will make good proofe to our <HI>England,</HI> that there
are at this day both <HI>Amazones,</HI> and <HI>Headlesse men.</HI> And
thus much for the <HI>Paradoxes.</HI></P>
<P>The last exception which may be made against this booke,
is the discourse of the <HI>Conuersion</HI> of the <HI>Kingdome</HI> of
<HI>Congo</HI> to <HI>Christianitie,</HI> which is amplified, and set out with


<PB REF="10">
such <HI>Miracles</HI> and <HI>Superstitious Vanities,</HI> as though it
had been plotted of purpose for the glorie and aduancement
of the <HI>Pope</HI> and his <HI>Adherents:</HI> Wherein, because it doth
concerne matter of <HI>Religion,</HI> I will deale more warily and
seriously to satisfie my <HI>Reader.</HI> True it is that the <HI>Inhabi|tants</HI>
of <HI>Congo</HI> were all <HI>Pagans</HI> and <HI>Heathens,</HI> vntill
they entertayned Traffike with the <HI>Portingales:</HI> Among
whome, one <HI>Massing Priest</HI> became a meanes to conferre with
a <HI>Noble Man</HI> of <HI>Congo</HI> concerning <HI>Christianitie,</HI> who
taking liking thereof, as being a <HI>Man</HI> of good inclination and
disposition, was very desirous to be further instructed. The
<HI>Priest</HI> being wise, tooke oportunitie to make way for his

Faith</HI> in that <HI>Region,</HI> It may be in hope to be prefer|red
and aduanced in a new established <HI>Church,</HI> as com|monly
our trauelling <HI>Priests</HI> vse to do, that wanting mainte|nance,
or being vpon some occasion discontented at home,
do leape ouer sea into forreine partes, not for the desier which
they haue to gaine <HI>Christian Soules,</HI> or to preach the <HI>Gos|pell,</HI>
but to procure to themselues either dignities or wealth.
But I do not say that this <HI>Priest</HI> was such a one: for I neither
haue reason nor authoritie so to say. For he sent ouer into
<HI>Portingall</HI> for some fellowes to helpe him, who being come
into <HI>Congo,</HI> laboured so much, that in time the <HI>King</HI> and
his people consented to become <HI>Christians.</HI> Then did the
<HI>Portingall-Priests</HI> bestirre themselues nimbly in <HI>Baptising</HI>
the <HI>King,</HI> the <HI>Queene,</HI> the <HI>Lordes,</HI> and the <HI>Commons.</HI>
They built <HI>Churches,</HI> they erected <HI>Altars,</HI> they set vp <HI>Cros|ses,</HI>
and at last brought in a <HI>Bishop.</HI> And all this was done
(I must needes confesse) with all pompe and solemnitie, after
the <HI>Romish</HI> maner, which in deede is so plausible, as it is able
to allure any simple Man or Woman, euen with the very sight


<PB REF="10">
thereof. Yet will I not denie, but that these <HI>Priests</HI> had a good
intent, and for my part I do beleeue that they were in <HI>bona
fide,</HI> because they conuerted a great part of the <HI>People,</HI> not
to <HI>Poperie,</HI> but to <HI>Christianitie,</HI> the true foundation of all

<HI>God,</HI> and may be a notable example to the <HI>World,</HI> of do|ing
the like, shall it be concealed and not committed to me|morie,

the hauen of <HI>Loanda,</HI> situate in the kingdome

reliefe, conducting and guiding the same with lightes


<PB N="2" REF="13">
in the night time, to the ende it shoulde not loose the
way, which the ship it selfe did keepe. He arriued at the
Islande of <HI>Madera,</HI> belonging to the King of Portugal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Island of <HI>Madera.</HI></NOTE>
distant from <HI>Lisbone</HI> about sixe hundred myles, where
he remained xv. dayes, to furnish himselfe with freshe
vittaile and wine; which in great aboundance grow|eth
in that Islande, yea and in mine opinion the best
in the world, whereof they carry abroad great store in|to
diuers countries, &amp; especially into England. He pro|uided
there also sundry other confections &amp; conserues
of Sugar, which in that Islande are made and wrought
both in great quantity, and also of singular excellency.
From this Islande they departed, leauing all the <HI>Cana|ries</HI>
belonging to <HI>Castile,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Canaries.</HI></NOTE> and tooke hauen at one of the
Islandes of <HI>Capo verde,</HI> called S. <HI>Anthony,</HI> without ha|uing

and from thence to another Islande called <HI>Saint Iacopo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isle of <HI>S. Iames</HI></NOTE>
which commaundeth all the rest, and hath a Bishoppe
and a Chaplen in it, that rule and gouerne them: and
here they prouided themselues againe of victuailes.</P>
<P>I doe not thinke it fitte in this place to tell you the
number of the Canarie Islands, which indeede are ma|ny:
nor to make any mention of the Islandes of <HI>Capo
verde,</HI> nor yet to set downe the history and discourse
of their situations, because I make hast to the kingdome
of <HI>Congo:</HI> and the shippe stayed here but onely for pas|sage,
and especially for that there doth not want good
store of Reportes and histories, which in particularity
doe make relation of these countries: Onely this I will
say,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Islandes of <HI>Capo verde.</HI></NOTE> that these Islandes of <HI>Capo verde</HI> were established by
<HI>Ptolomee</HI> in the tables of his <HI>Geography,</HI> to be the begin|ning
of the West, together with the Cape or Promon|torie


<PB N="3" REF="13">
which he termeth <HI>Cornu vltimum,</HI> or the Islandes
<HI>Macarie</HI> or <HI>Blessed,</HI> which we commonly call <HI>Fortunate.</HI>
In these Islandes of <HI>Capo verde</HI> the Portugalles do often
arriue, and in those countries do trafficke with sundry
marchandises, as little balles of diuers coloured glasse, &amp;
other such things, wherein those people do greatly de|light,
and Hollande cloth, and cappes and kniues, and
coloured clothes: In exchaunge whereof they bringe
back againe, slaues, wax, hony, with other kind of food,
and cotton-cloth of sundry colours. Moreouer, right
ouer against them within the lande are the countreyes
&amp; riuers of <HI>Guynee,</HI> and of <HI>Capo verde,</HI> and <HI>Sterra Leona,</HI>
that is to say the Mountain <HI>Leona,</HI> which is a huge great
mountaine and very famous.</P>
<P>From the foresaide Islande of <HI>San Iacopo,</HI> they direc|ted
their fore-decke towards Bresil: for so they must
do to gaine the winde, and taking such harboroughes
as were conuenient for the seasons that raigne in those
places,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two waies from <HI>S. Iacopo</HI> to <HI>Loanda.</HI></NOTE> to arriue at the ende of their voyage. Two are
the waies, whereby they saile from the Isle of <HI>San Iaco|po</HI>
to <HI>Loanda</HI> a hauen in the kingdome of <HI>Congo:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The first way.</NOTE> the one
is by the coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> the other by the mayne Ocean,
still enlarging their course with the North winde,
which very much ruleth there in those Monethes, and
for the most parte is called North, euen by the Portu|galles
themselues, &amp; by the Castilians, &amp; by the French,
and by all those people of the North sea. And so tur|ning
their foreshippe to the South, and south-east, they
holde on forwarde till they be neere the Cape of <HI>Good-Hope,</HI>
leauing behind them the Kingdome of <HI>Angola;</HI>
for by that way they must afterwardes returne: &amp; then
they come to the altitude of betweene xxvij. and xxix.


<PB N="4" REF="14">
degrees beyond the equinoctiall, quite opposite to our
Pole, which South Pole in this writing shall be called
the Antarctike,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Antarctik is the South Pole.</NOTE> that is to say, contrary to the Arctike,
which is our North Pole, and so the Antarctik is oppo|site
thereunto towardes the South.</P>
<P>In that altitude then of the contrary Pole, the Say|lers
vse to meete with certaine windes that they cal <HI>Ge|nerali,</HI>
which doe blowe there almost all our Sommer,
and are termed by them <HI>Northeast,</HI> and <HI>Northeastes</HI> in
the plural number, and by vs Italians, <HI>Li venti dal Graeco,</HI>
that is to say, the windes betweene the Northeast, and
the Easte in the spring time: which peraduenture the
Venetians in their proper speech doe call <HI>Leuantiere,</HI>
that is to say, easterly, &amp; the Greekes and Latines terme
them <HI>Etesii,</HI> that is to say, such winds as euery yeare do
ordinarily blow in their certayne and accustomed sea|sons.</P>
<P>And thus sayling euen to xxix degrees of the An|tarctik,
with the North winde, there falleth out an
admirable effect. For diuers saylers, perceyuing the
first Generall windes when they blowe, doe straight
turne their sailes about, and set their fore-ship directly
on the way to <HI>Angola,</HI> and so very oftentimes they fayle
and are deceyued. But better it is for him that desireth
to arriue at his wished hauen to go much further, &amp; to
expect a lustie winde, and after to returne backwarde:
wherin it is to be noted for a most memorable accide~t,
that the windes do blow very strong from the North,
euen vnto xxix. degrees beyond the Equinoctiall, and
then they meete with other winds, which being more
fierce &amp; furious then they are, doe driue them backe a|gaine.
And this is vsuall and seasonable there for sixe


<PB N="5" REF="14">
monethes in the yeare.</P>
<P>Now the ship called <HI>S. Anthony,</HI> holding on his fore|said
course, met with the said Generall windes, &amp; then
turned their prowe and their sayles, by North and by
Northwest on the right hand towardes the kingdome
of <HI>Congo.</HI> And sayling onwardes closely with the halfe
shippe, they came in twelue dayes and twelue nightes,
to the Islande of <HI>S. Elena,</HI> not looking for the same, nor
thinking of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isle of <HI>S. Elena.</HI></NOTE> This Islande was so called, because
on the feast day of <HI>S. Helene,</HI> which falleth vppon the
thirde day of May, it was by the Portugalles first des|cried.
And as it is very smal, so is it (as it were) singular
by it selfe: for being situate in the height of xvi. degrees
towardes the Antarctike, it contayneth in compasse
nine miles about, &amp; is farre distant from the firme land.
As you sayle by sea, it may be discouered thirty myles
of, through certayne hilles: and it is a great miracle of
nature, that in so vnmeasurable an Ocean, being all a|lone
and so little as it is, it shoulde arise (as it were) out
of a most tempestuous and deep sea, &amp; yet yeeld a most
safe harborough, and most aboundant store of reliefe
and victuaile, for shippes that are forewearied, and rea|dy
to perishe for thirst, which come out of the In|dies.</P>
<P>The woodes of it are very thicke, and full of Ebene
trees,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The commo|dities of <HI>S. Elena.</HI></NOTE> whereof the Mariners do builde their boates. In
the barkes of these trees you may see written the names
of an infinite number of Saylers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Woode.</NOTE> which passing by that
Islande, doe leaue their names cut and carued in the
sayde barkes, the letters whereof doe grow greater and
greater, as the bodies of the trees doe waxe greater in
bignes. The soyle (euen of it selfe) bringeth forth very


<PB N="6" REF="15">
excellent fruites.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vine trees</NOTE> For there groweth the vine, (which
was in deede at the first brought thether by the Portu|galles)
and especially in the arbours and walkes that are
about the little Church, and in the lodgings that are
there for such as sayle thether.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruites.</NOTE> You shall see there also
huge wild woodes, of Orenges, of Citrones, of Limons
and other such Apple trees, that all the yeare long doe
carry flowers &amp; fruites both ripe and vnripe. And like|wise
Pomegranates, great and sweete, and of a good
indifferent taste, with kernelles great and redde, and ful
of pleasant iuyce, and the stones within them very smal:
and ripe they are at all seasons of the yeare, as the Oren|ges
are: and figges very great both in quantity and a|boundance:
which naturall gift and property (of being
ripe all the yeare long) <HI>Homere</HI> noted to bee in diuers
fruites of the Isle of <HI>Corfu.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Odysi. H.</NOTE></P>
<P>Ouer all the countrey they take Goates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Victuailes.</NOTE> and wilde
Kiddes, that are very good to eate, and Boares and o|ther
foure-footed beasts, and Partriches, and wild hens
and Pigeons, and other kindes of foules, both great &amp;
small. All which beastes and fowles are so secure and
so tame, that they feare not a man, because they doe not
know in what daunger they are to be killed. So that the
people which dwell there doo take of them dayly, and
poulder them with salte, that is congealed on the banks
of the Islande in certaine caues and holes of the rockes,
that are naturally made hollow and eaten by the waues
of the sea. And the flesh thereof being thus preserued,
they giue to the Saylers that arriue at the Island.</P>
<P>The earth is as it were crommeled like ashes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soyle.</NOTE> of co|lour
redde, very fat and fruitfull beyond measure, and
so soft, as if ye treade on it with your foote; it will sinke


<PB N="7" REF="15">
like sande, and the very trees will shake with the force
of a man. And therefore it needeth no labour or tillage:
for when it raigneth, the fruites doe presently spring vp
out of the olde seede. It beareth rootes of Radish as
bigge as a mans legge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rootes and hearbes.</NOTE> and very good to eate. There
growe also Colewortes, and Parsley, and Lettise, and
Goordes, and Chiche-person, and Faselles, and other
kindes of Pulse, naturally: which being ripe doo fall in|to
the fruitfull grounde, and multiply of themselues,
and spring agayne without any tilling. Euery shippe
that commeth thether, bringeth with it some fruyte or
garden hearbe, which being planted taketh roote pre|sently:
and bountifull nature yeeldeth a courteous re|warde
and vsury, by reseruing the fruite thereof for the
Saylers when the ship returneth againe.</P>
<P>There are certaine little Riuers in this Islande,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Riuers.</NOTE> that
runne in diuerse partes of it: whose water is good
and wholesome, and wherein are sundry safe places for
ships to ryde in, as if they were hauens. But the prin|cipall
of them is in a place, where they haue erected a
little Church, wherein are kept the ornamentes of the
Altar, and the priestes vestimentes, and other necessaries
for Masse. And when shippes passe that way, the Re|ligious
persons go downe vnto them to celebrate di|uine
seruice.</P>
<P>There is also in the same place a little cottage, where|in
for the most parte some Portingalles doo remayne,
sometimes three, sometimes two, yea and sometimes
but one alone, being left there, eyther by reason of
some infirmitie, or for some offence committed, or
else euen voluntarily, because they doe desire by this
meanes to leade the life of an Heremite in that wilder|nesse,


<PB N="8" REF="16">
and so to doe penaunce for their sinnes.</P>
<P>Moreouer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fishe.</NOTE> in the same place there is so great aboun|daunce
of fish, as if the sea were very neere vnto them:
so that you shall not need but onely to cast your hooks
into the water, and you shall presently drawe them out
againe loaden with fish.</P>
<P>I once demanded the questio~,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the Is|land of <HI>S. Elena</HI> is not fortified</NOTE> what reason there was,
why the Portingals did neuer make any accompt, nor
had any care to fortifie this Island, considering it was so
fit and necessary for saylers, and founded there (as it
were by the prouidence of God) for the reliefe of the
Portingals which passe that way, as <HI>Granata</HI> doth large|ly
discourse vpon the Creede, first written by him in
Spanishe, and since translated by my selfe into Italian:
But aunswere was made vnto mee, that there was no
need so to doo: for that the Islande serueth to no pur|pose
for the voyage into the Indies, because there is
another way for that passage, and it is also a very harde
matter to finde it out: but in returning from thence it
lyeth full in the way, and is very easily descried. So that
it woulde not quite the cost to bestow money &amp; time
in maintayning souldiers therein without any profite,
seeing none other vessels come thither but onely the
Portugals. And when I replyed, that the English had
nowe twice entred into those seas;<NOTE PLACE="marg">This slaunde|rous terme v|sed here by this Portugal, cannot im|peach the cre|dite of these two honoura|ble gentlemen</NOTE> once vnder the con|duct
of <HI>Drake,</HI> and secondly this year 1588. vnder ano|ther
Pirate, being also an English man and more valiant
then hee, called <HI>Candish,</HI> who is returned home ful of
great richesse: It was aunswered, that yet for all that it
coulde not possibly bee brought to passe to fortifie the
same within a sea being so farre off, and seeing that
all the prouision which should build there, must of ne|cessity


<PB N="9" REF="16">
bee brought out of Europe.</P>
<P>To be short,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Climate.</NOTE> besides all these naturall good giftes
aboue rehearsed, the climate is temperate, the ayre
pure, cleane and holesome, and the winds which blow
there are very pleasaunt. So that sicke persons, and such
as were halfe deade with the diseases of the sea, arry|uing
at this Island, haue beene presently healed, and
recouered their former strength, through the benigni|ty
of this Country.</P>
<P>From the Islande of <HI>S. Helena,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Port of <HI>Loanda.</HI></NOTE> they made sayle with
the same weather, and so within the space of xvij. dayes
came to the hauen of <HI>Loanda,</HI> which is in the prouince
of <HI>Congo,</HI> the windes being somewhat more calme then
they were afore. This is a very sure, and a great hauen,
so called of an Islande of the same name, whereof wee
shall speake hereafter.</P>
<P>I told you before, there were two courses of sayling
from the Islands of <HI>Capo verde</HI> to <HI>Loanda;</HI> the one of the~
is now declared, which beeing neuer vsed afterwardes,
was at the first attempted and performed by the same
ship wherein <HI>Signor Odoardo</HI> went, being then guided
by <HI>Francesco Martinez</HI> the kings Pilot, a man very great|ly
experienced in those seas, and the first that euer con|ducted
vessell by that way: the other is atchieued by
passing along the coast of the firme lande.</P>
<P>From the Island of <HI>San Iacomo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The seconde course of say|ling to <HI>Loa~da.</HI> The Isle of <HI>S. Thomas.</HI></NOTE> they come to <HI>Capo

Islande of <HI>San Thomas,</HI> which lyeth vnder the Equino|ctial,
so called because it was discouered vpon that day,
wherein the feast of that Apostle is vsed to bee celebra|ted.
It is distant from the firme lande CLxxx. myles,
right against the riuer called Gaban, which is so termed


<PB N="10" REF="17">
because it is in shape very like to that kinde of vesture
that it is called a Gaban or a cloake.</P>
<P>The hauen thereof is fore-closed with an Island that

from other Countreys:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ginger.</NOTE> as they did Ginger also, which

The soyle in deed is moyst, and as it were appropriated
to foster the Sugar Cane, which without any other wa|tering,
multiplyeth of it selfe, and fructifieth infinitely:
the reason whereof is, because the dewe falleth there
like rayne and moisteneth the earth.</P>
<P>There are in this Island aboue Lxx. houses or presses
for making of Sugar,<NOTE PLACE="marg">70. houses to make sugar in.</NOTE> and euery presse hath many cot|tages

bee about some three hundred persons that are appoin|ted

about fortie great shippes with sugar. True it is indeed
that not long ago the wormes (as it were a plague to
that land) haue deuoured the rootes of the Canes, and
destroyed the fruites of their sugar, in such sort, as now
of the forty shippes, they do not load aboue fiue or sixe

that sugar is growen so deare in those Coun|treyes.</P>

is the colde in the toppes of the Mountaines grea|ter

Winter time the ayre is more hote then it is in som|mer,
by reason of their continual raynes, and especially
about two houres before &amp; after Noone, so that it can
hardely be endured.</P>
<P>The men are blacke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The complex|ion of the people.</NOTE> &amp; so are the women, and some

<P>The Winter in this countrey (to speake at large) be|ginneth
at the same time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their winter &amp; sommer.</NOTE> that our Spring here begin|neth,
that is to say, when the Sun entreth into the Nor|thren

May, June, July</HI> &amp; <HI>August.</HI> Of faire daies they haue but a
few, because the raine falleth so greatly, &amp; the drops of
it are so big, as it is a wonder to see. These waters doe


<PB N="15" REF="19">
maruellously supple the grounde, which is then very
drie, by reason of the heate of the Sommer past, where|in
it neuer rayneth for the space of sixe monethes to|gether,
and after the ground is full and as it were ingor|ged
with water, then do the riuers swell beyond all cre|dite,
and are so replenished with troubled waters, that
all the countrey is surrounded by them.</P>
<P>The windes which blow in these Moones through
all this region,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The winds in this Country, in winter time.</NOTE> are the very selfe same that <HI>Cesar</HI> calleth
by a Greeke worde <HI>Etesij,</HI> that is to say, <HI>Ordinary euery
yeare:</HI> whereby are meant those winds that in the <HI>Cearde</HI>
are noted from the North to the West, and from the
North to the Northeast. These windes doo driue the
cloudes to the huge and high mountaines, whereupon
they rush with very great violence, and being there stai|ed
of their owne nature, they are afterwardes melted
into water. So that when it is likely to raine, you shall
see the cloudes standing (as it were) vpon the toppes of
their highest hils.</P>

<HI>Senega,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Riuer <HI>Nigir</HI> or <HI>Se|nega,</HI> runneth westwarde.</NOTE> you shall see the saide riuer encrease at the very

of <HI>Capo Verde,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nilus</HI> run|neth north|warde.</NOTE> whereas <HI>Nilus</HI> runneth by the Isle of <HI>Me|roe</HI>
in <HI>Egipt</HI> towardes the North, refreshing and wate|ring
all those Regions that are full of scorching heates,

<PB N="16" REF="20">
the regions of <HI>Congo</HI> and <HI>Aethiopia</HI> it is alwaies wont to
rayne euery yeare at a certaine set tyme, the swelling
and ouerflowing of the riuers there, is of no great
consideration, nor any straunge accident to make ac|compt
of.</P>
<P>But in the Countries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It neuer ray|neth in <HI>Egypt</HI> but onely in <HI>Alexandria.</HI></NOTE> that are farre distant and very
drie, as in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> where it neuer raineth (sauing onely
in <HI>Alexandria</HI> and the territories thereof) it is accoun|ted
a maruellous matter, to see euery yeare so great a
quantity of thicke troubled water come vppon them,
from places so remote, at a certaine set tyme, without
missing: which water doth quicken the grounde, and
ministreth foode both to man and beast. And there|vpon
the auncients did sacrifice to that riuer, calling it
<GAP DESC="foreign">, the <HI>good God,</HI> as <HI>Ptolomy</HI> noteth in his fourth
booke. Yea and some of our Christians at this day doo
hold it for a miracle. So that without these waters they
shoulde perish for hunger, because their liues do de|pende
vpon this increase of the water, as <HI>S. Chrysostome</HI>
saith.</P>
<P>Thus these windes called by <HI>Cesar Etesij,</HI> and by the
Portugalles <HI>Generali,</HI> do blow with vs in Sommer; but
with them in winter, and carry the cloudes vnto the
toppes of those huge mountaines, which make them to
melt into raine. And so it falleth out that by reason of
these raines, their winter (as it is aforesaid) is nothing so
colde, because the waters do engender a certayne kind
of warmth in those hot regions. This is then the cause
of the increase of <HI>Nilus,</HI> &amp; other riuers in that Climate,
whereof the ancients of old times made so great doubt,
and inuented so many fables and errours</P>
<P>But in their sommer, which is our winter, there blow


<PB N="17" REF="20">
other windes that are quite opposite to the former,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their winds in sommer time.</NOTE> e|uen
in <HI>Diametro,</HI> and are noted in the <HI>Carde,</HI> from the
South to the southeast, which out of all question must
needes be colde, because they breath from the contra|ry
Pole Antarctike, and coole all those countreyes, euen
for all the worlde as our windes in Sommer doo coole
our countreyes. And whereas, there with them, these
windes do make the ayre very fayre and cleere, so doo
they neuer come vnto vs, but they bring with them
great store of raine. And this commeth to passe by a
certain naturall disposition of the earth which is gouer|ned
by the Heauens and the Clymates thereof, and
by the soueraigne prouidence of God, who hath
parted the heauen, and the course of the sunne and of
the other planets in such sort, that euery countrey vpon
the face of the earth, doth inioy the vertue of their
lightes, both in heate, and in colde, and also in all other
seasons of the yeare, by a most singular measure and
proportion. And certainly if the breath of these winds
did not refresh and coole these countries of <HI>Aethiopia</HI> &amp;
<HI>Congo,</HI> and other places neere about them, it were not
possible for them to endure the heate, considering that
euen in the night tyme they are constrayned to hange
two coueringes ouer them to keep away the heat. The
same cooling and refreshing by windes, is common also
to the inhabitants of the Isle of <HI>Candie,</HI> &amp; of the Islandes
in <HI>Arcipelago,</HI> and of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and of <HI>Asia</HI> the <HI>lesse,</HI> and of
<HI>Soria,</HI> and of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> which doe liue (as it were) with
this refreshing of the foresaid winds of the Northwest,
and of the West: so that they may well be called as they
are in Greeke <HI>Zephyri quasi</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Snow nor ice in <HI>Ethiopia</HI> or <HI>Congo.</HI></NOTE> breeders of life.</P>
<P>Let it bee also remembred, that in the mountaines of


<PB N="18" REF="21">
<HI>Aethiopia,</HI> and of <HI>Congo</HI> &amp; the regions neere adioyning,
there falleth no snow, neither is there any at all in the

of <HI>Good-Hope,</HI> and certaine other hilles, which the Por|tugalles
call, <HI>Sierra Neuada,</HI> that is to say, the <HI>Snowie
mountaines.</HI> Neyther is there anye ice or snow to bee
founde in all the Countrey of <HI>Congo,</HI> which would bee
better esteemed there then golde, to mingle with their
drinkes: So that the riuers there doo not swell and in|crease
by melting of snow, but because the raine doth
fall out of the cloudes for fiue whole Moones continu|ally
together, that is to lay in <HI>April, May, Iune, Iuly,</HI> &amp;
<HI>August:</HI> the first raine sometimes beginning on the xv.
day, and sometimes after. And this is the cause why

<P>_AL the auncient writers haue certainly
beleeued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The true cause of white &amp; blacke in the bodies of the inhabi|tantes of these countries.</NOTE> that the cause of blacke co|lour
in men is from the heate of the

that the neerer wee approach to the
cuntries of the <HI>South,</HI> the browner &amp;


<PB N="19" REF="21">
blacker are the inhabitants therein. And contrariwise,
the farther you go towardes the north, the whiter shall
you finde the men, as the <HI>French,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Dutch,</HI> &amp; the
<HI>English,</HI> and others. Notwithstanding it is as certaine a
thing as may be, that vnder the <HI>Equinoctiall,</HI> there are
people which are borne almost all white, as in the king|dome
of <HI>Melinde</HI> &amp; <HI>Mombaza</HI> situate vnder the <HI>Equino|ctial,</HI>
&amp; in the Isle of <HI>San Thomas</HI> which lieth also vnder
the same Clymate, and was at the first inhabited by the
Portingalles, though afterwardes it was disinhabited,
and for the space of a hundred yeares and vpwardes
their children were continually white, yea and euery
day still become whiter and whiter. And so likewise
the children of the Portingals, which are borne of the
women of <HI>Congo,</HI> do incline somewhat towards white.
So that <HI>Signor Odoardo</HI> was of opinion, that the blacke
colour did not spring from the heate of the Sunne, but
from the nature of the seede, being induced thereunto
by the reasons aboue mentioned. And surely this his
opinion is confirmed by the testimony of <HI>Ptolome,</HI> who
in his discription of the innermost partes of <HI>Lybia</HI> ma|keth

<P>They make great store of linnen of the <HI>Palme</HI> tree,

silke, whereof we will discourse more hereafter. The
people are subiect to a king&punc; that hath other princes vn|der
him: they are very actiue and warlike:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Bowes.</NOTE> They are
ready to take armes, and doo fight on foote. Their wea|pons
are different from the weapons of all other people
rounde about them: for their bowes are small and short,
made of wood, and wrapped about with serpents skins
of diuers colours, and so smoothly wrought, that you
woulde thinke them to be all one with the wood. And
this they doo, both to make the bowe stronger, and also
to holde it the faster. Their stringes are of little wood|den

arrowes are short and slender, and of a very hard wood,
and they carry them on their bow hande. They are so
quicke in shooting, that holding xxviij. shaftes or moe
in their bow-hand, they will shoote and discharge them

all, before the first arrow light on the grounde: yea and

<P>Other weapons also they make, as <HI>Axes</HI> and <HI>Hat|chets,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their weapons</NOTE>
which they vse and frame after a strange manner.
For the handle is shorter by the halfe then the iron is,
and at the lowest end of it there is a pommell&punc; for the fa|ster
holding of it in the hand, and all couered ouer with
the foresaid skinne of a serpent. In the vppermost ende
of it, is the iron very bright and shining, fastned to the
woode with plates of <HI>Copper,</HI> in the manner of two
nailes, as long as the handle: it hath two edges, the one
cutteth like a hatchet, and maketh a wounde after the
fashion of a halfe Roundell&punc; the other is a hammer.
When they fight with their enemies, or defende them|selues
from their arrowes, they are so exercised with a
wonderful speed and nimblenesse to manage their wea|pons,
that whirling them rounde about, as it were in a
circle, they keepe all that compasse of the ayre which is
before them, so that when the enemie shooteth, &amp; the
arrowe beginneth to fall, it lighteth vpon the hatchet,
being so swiftly and vehemently whirled about, that it
breaketh the force of the arrowe, and so it is repulsed:
Then do they hang the <HI>Hatchet</HI> vpo~ their shoulder, &amp; be+gin
to shoot themselues. They haue also certaine short
daggers, with sheathes of the serpents skins, made like
kniues with a haft vnto them, which they vse to weare
a crosse. Their girdles are of diuers sorts, but the men of
war haue their girdles of <HI>Elephants</HI> skin, 3. good fingers
broad: &amp; because they are at the first 2. fingers thicke, &amp;

<P>_THe East Coast of the kingdome

tolde you) at the meeting of the
Riuer <HI>Vumba,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Easterne border of <HI>Congo.</HI></NOTE> and the Riuer of
<HI>Zaire;</HI> and so with a line drawen
towardes the South in equall di|stance
from the Riuer <HI>Nilus,</HI>
which lyeth on the left hande, it
taketh vp a great mountaine which is very high, &amp; not
inhabited in the toppes thereof, called the mountaine
of <HI>Christal,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The moun|taine of <HI>Chry|stall.</HI></NOTE> because there is in it great quantity of <HI>Christal</HI>

And then passing on further includeth the hilles that are
called <HI>Sierras de Sol,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The moun|taines of the <HI>Sunne.</HI></NOTE> that is to say, the hilles of the <HI>Sunne,</HI>
because they are exceeding high. And yet it neuer sno|weth
vpon them, neyther doe they beare any thing,
but are very bare and without any trees at all: On the
leaft hand there arise other hils, called the hilles of <HI>Sal-Nitrum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The moun|tains of <HI>Sal-Nitrum.</HI></NOTE>
because there is in the~ great store of that <HI>Mine|ral.</HI>
And so cutting ouer the riuer <HI>Berbela,</HI> that commeth


<PB N="39" REF="31">
out of the first Lake, there endeth the ancient bound of
the kingdome of <HI>Congo</HI> on the East.</P>
<P>Thus then the east coast of this kingdome is deriued
from the meeting of the two foresaid riuers <HI>Vumba</HI> and
<HI>Zaire,</HI> vntill you come to the lake <HI>Achelunda,</HI> and to the
Countrey of <HI>Malemba;</HI> contayning the space of sixe
hundred miles. From this lyne, which is drawen in the
easterne coast of <HI>Congo</HI> to the riuer <HI>Nilus,</HI> and to the two
Lakes (whereof mention shalbe made in conuenient
place) there is the space of 150. miles of ground wel in|habited,
and good store of hils, which do yeeld sundry
mettalles, with much linnen, and cloth of the <HI>Palme</HI>
tree.</P>
<P>And seeing wee are now come to this point of this
discourse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The arte of making Silkes in this Eastern Coast.</NOTE> it will be very necessary to declare vnto you
the maruellous arte which the people of this countrey,
and other places thereabouts do vse in making cloathes
of sundry sortes, as <HI>Veluets</HI> shorne and vnshorne, cloth
of <HI>Tinue, Sattens, Taffata, Damaskes, Sarcenettes</HI> and
such like, not of any silken stuffe, (for they haue no
knowledge of the Silkewormes at all, although some of
their apparell bee made of silke that is brought thether
from our Countreys.) But they weaue their cloathes a|forenamed
of the leaues of <HI>Palme</HI> trees, which trees they
alwayes keepe vnder and lowe to the grounde, euery
yeare cutting them, and watering them, to the ende
they may grow smal and tender against the new spring.
Out of these leaues being cleansed &amp; purged after their
manner they drawe forth their threedes, which are all
very fine and dainty, and all of one euennesse, sauing
that those which are longest, are best esteemed. For of
those they weaue their greatest peeces. These stuffes


<PB N="40" REF="32">
they worke of diuers fashions, as some with a nappe vp|on
them like <HI>Veluet</HI> on both sides, and other cloath cal|led
<HI>Damaskes,</HI> braunched with leaues, and such other
thinges; &amp; the <HI>Broccati,</HI> which are called <HI>High</HI> and <HI>Lowe,</HI>
and are farre more precious then ours are. This kinde
of cloath no man may weare but the king, and such as it
pleaseth him. The greatest peeces are of these <HI>Broccati:</HI>
for they contayne in length fower and fiue spannes,
and in breadth, three and foure spannes, and are called
<HI>Incorimbas,</HI> by the name of the countrey where it grow|eth,
which is about the Riuer <HI>Vumba.</HI> The <HI>Veluettes</HI> are
called <HI>Enzachas</HI> of the same bignesse, and the <HI>Damaskes
Insulas,</HI> and the <HI>Rasi Maricas,</HI> and the <HI>Zendadi Tangas,</HI> &amp;
the <HI>Ormesini Engombos.</HI> Of the lighter sort of these stuffes
they haue greater peeces which are wrought by the <HI>An|zichi,</HI>
and are sixe spannes long, and fiue spannes
broade, wherewith euery man may apparell himselfe
according to his habilitie. Besides that, they are very
thicke and sounde to keepe out the water, and yet very
light to weare. The Portingalles haue lately begun to
vse them for tents and boothes, which do maruellously
resist both water and winde.</P>
<P>This coast then shutteth vp the kingdome of <HI>Congo,</HI>

himselfe, and therefore eyther payeth tribute, or refu|seth

<P>It came to passe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn</HI> the se|cond, K. of <HI>Portingall,</HI> first brought chri|stianity into <HI>Congo.</HI></NOTE> that <HI>Don Giouanni</HI> the second, being

Kingdome of <HI>Congo,</HI> and thereupon the king of <HI>Congo</HI>
became a Christian. After which time the Lorde of
<HI>Angola</HI> was alwaies in amitie, and (as it were) a vassall
of the forenamed King of <HI>Congo,</HI> and the people of both
countries did trafficke together one with another, and
the Lord of <HI>Angola</HI> did euery yeare sende some presents
to the king of <HI>Congo.</HI> And by licence from the King of
<HI>Congo</HI> there was a great trade betweene the Portingalles
and the people of <HI>Angola</HI> at the hauen of <HI>Loanda,</HI>
where they bought slaues and chaunged them for o|ther

that the trafficke was heere vnited with the trafficke
of <HI>S. Thomas:</HI> so that the shippes did vse first to arriue
at that Islande, and then afterwarde passed ouer to <HI>Loan|da.</HI>
And when this trade began in processe of time to
increase, they dispatched their shippes from <HI>Lisbone</HI> to
<HI>Angola</HI> of themselues, and sent with them a Gouernour
called <HI>Paulo Diaz</HI> of <HI>Nouais,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Paulo Diaz</HI> the first disco|uerer of this trafficke.</NOTE> to whome this busines did

there to sell and barter them, it pleased his Lordship to
giue out order, that all the Marchants should be slaine,
and their goods confiscated, alleadging for his defence,
that they were come thether as spies, and to take pos|session
of his estate: but in truth it is thought that hee
did it onely to gaine all that wealth to himselfe, consi|dering
that it was a people that did not deale in the ha|bite

of certayne thinne plates of iron, which are hollowe

do ring &amp; make a noise, &amp; ad courage vnto them,

declared, that is to say, bowe and arrowes, sworde, dag|ger

target: for those two weapons may not be worne toge|ther,
but sword &amp; target they may lawfully weare both
at once.</P>
<P>The common souldiers go all naked from the girdle|stead
vpwardes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Military apparell of the meaner sort.</NOTE> and haue the rest of their bodies armed
with bowe and arrowes and daggers. These are they
that do first offer the skirmish, going out before the rest
of the armie, as it were seuerally and dispersedly pro|uoking
to fight, and receyuing the shot from a farre
of, they turne and winde this way and that way, and


<PB N="51" REF="37">
doo nimbly leape from one side to another, to the ende
they may auoide the lighting of their enemies arrowes.
Besides these there are also certaine quicke and gallant
young men that runne out before the rest, which with
the ringing of their bels (as afore is sayde) are as it were
comforters of their fellows, and when they haue fought
so much, that the Captaine thinketh them to bee euen
weary, then doth he call them backe with the sounde of
one of those instruments aboue mentioned: so that per|ceyuing
the medley to waxe hote, they turne about and
retyre themselues back againe, &amp; others succeed in their
places, which course is still obserued and kept vntill such
time, as both the armies do indeed ioyne all their maine
forces together, and so fight it out.</P>
<P>In the place aboue described,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The issue of this battell.</NOTE> there were sundry en|counters
on the one side and on the other. And in the
first battels the people of <HI>Congo</HI> remayned conquerours:
but afterwards, when they had diuers times fought to|gether
with great losse on both sides, and victuailes be|gan
nowe to faile, and consequently men waxed sicke
and died, the Campe of the king of <HI>Congo</HI> was dissolued,
and euery man returned to his owne home.</P>
<P>In this meane while <HI>Paulo Diaz,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. Diaz <HI>at</HI> Luiola.</NOTE> though he coulde
not ioyne his forces with the Armie of his frendes that
came to succour him, yet set himselfe forwardes, and
passing ouer the riuer stayed at <HI>Luiola,</HI> because it was a
place very strong &amp; fit to resist the King of <HI>Angola.</HI> The
situation of <HI>Luiola</HI> is this: The two riuers <HI>Coanza</HI> and
<HI>Luiola</HI> do ioyne together about 105. miles from the sea
shore, and a little aboue the said ioyning together, these
Riuers doe seauer themselues for the space of an Arcu|buse
shotte, so that they make as it were an Islande be|tweene


<PB N="52" REF="38">
them: In which Islande at the meeting of the
two riuers there riseth a hill, which <HI>Paulo Diaz</HI> surprised
and fortified for his better safety. And whereas in times
past there was neuer any habitation there, nowe at this
present it is growen to be a prety conntrey inhabited by
the <HI>Portingalles.</HI></P>
<P>From this place thus surprised by <HI>Paulo Diaz,</HI> and
called <HI>Luiola,</HI> you may saile along the riuer with certain
small vesselles, euen to the sea, and goe by lande with|out
any daunger for the space of one hundred and fiue
miles.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The hilles of <HI>Cabambe.</HI></NOTE> Neere therevnto are the hilles that are called the
hilles of <HI>Cabambe,</HI> producing infinite store of siluer:
which the saide <HI>Diaz</HI> doth euery day by little and little
endeauour to conquere. And these hils are the graund
quarrell betweene him and the people of <HI>Angola.</HI> For
knowing that the <HI>Portingalles</HI> doe esteeme greatly of
these hilles, in regarde of the siluer pits which are there
in great aboundance, they doe vse all the force and skill
they can to keepe the <HI>Portingalles</HI> from them. They
fight also with them in diuers other places: for the Por|tingalles
passing ouer the riuer <HI>Coanza</HI> doe continually
make inroades into the countries that are subiect to the
king of <HI>Angola.</HI></P>
<P>The weapons of these peoples, are bowes sixe hand|fulles
long,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The weapons of the people of <HI>Angola.</HI></NOTE> with stringes made of the barkes of trees: &amp;
arrowes of woode, lesse then a mans little finger, and
sixe handefuls long. They haue iron heads made like a
hooke, and feathers of birdes in the toppes of them: and
of these arrowes they vse to carry to the number of sixe
or seauen vpon their bow hand, without any quiuer at
all. Their daggers are fashioned with a haft after the
manner of a knife, which they weare at their girdle, on


<PB N="53" REF="38">
their left side, and hold them aloft in their hands, when
they fight with them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their military actions.</NOTE> By their <HI>Militarie</HI> actions and pro|ceedinges
you may obserue their great skill and good
order in matter of warre. For in diuers battels that were
betweene them and the <HI>Portingalles,</HI> it was plainly seene
how they coulde choose their aduantages against their
enemies, as by assaulting them in the night time, and
in rayny weather, to the ende that their arcubuses and
guns shold not take fire, &amp; also by diuiding their forces
into many troups, to trouble them the more. The king
doth not vse to go to the warre in his owne person, but
sendeth his <HI>Captains</HI> in his steed. The people are also ac|customed
to flie &amp; run away incontinently, as soone as
they see their Captaine slaine, neyther can they be per|swaded
to stay by any reason or argument, but present|ly
yeelde vp the fielde. They are all footemen, neyther
haue they any horses at all. And therefore the Cap|taines
if they will not go on foote, cause themselues to
be carried on the shoulders of their slaues, after one of
the three manners, which wee will shew vnto you here|after.
This nation goeth out to warre in number almost
infinite, and very confusedly: they leaue no man at
home that is fit to carry a weapon: they make no prepa|ration
of victuailes necessary for the Campe: but such
as perhaps haue any, conuey it with them vpon the shol|ders
of their seruantes, and yet they haue sundry sortes
of creatures that might bee managed, and serue their
turnes to drawe and to carry as in the seconde part of
this Treatise shalbe described vnto you. And thereup|on
it falleth out, that when they come into any country
with their whole armie, all their foode is quickly quite
consumed, &amp; then hauing nothing leaft to feede vpon,


<PB N="54" REF="39">
they dissolue their hoast euen in the greatest necessity
of prosecuting their enterprise, and so are inforced by
hunger to returne into their owne countries.</P>
<P>They are greatly giuen to <HI>Diuination</HI> by birdes: If
a bird chaunce to flie on their leaft hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are giue~ to diuination by birdes.</NOTE> or crie in such
manner, as those which make profession to vnderstand
the same, doe say that it fore-sheweth ill lucke and ad|uersity,
or that they may go no further forwardes, they
will presently turne backe and repayre home: which
custome was also in the old time obserued by the anci|ent
<HI>Romanes,</HI> and likewise at this day by sundry other
<HI>Pagans.</HI></P>
<P>Now if it shall seeme straunge to any man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why so small a number, as <HI>Paulo Diaz,</HI> had with him, was able to re|sist so huge an armie of the K. of <HI>Angola.</HI></NOTE> that so
few <HI>Portingall</HI> souldiours as <HI>Paulo Diaz</HI> retayneth there
with him, and others of the <HI>Portingall</HI> nation, which
traffick into the Realme, &amp; relieue him with succours,
being in number but three hundred at the most, ac|counting
their slaues, and also the <HI>Malcontentes,</HI> the
rebelles and fugitiues of <HI>Angola</HI> which dayly resort vn|to
him, &amp; amount not in al to the quantity of xv, thou|sand
men, should be able to make so gallant a resistance
against that innumerable rabble of <HI>Negroes,</HI> being sub|iect
to the king of <HI>Angola,</HI> which are gathered there to|gether
(as it is said) to the number of a Million of soules.
I aunswere, that great reason may bee alleadged for the
same. For the armie of the <HI>Negroes</HI> is all naked, and vt|terly
destitute of all prouision and furniture for armour
of defence: And as for their weapons of offence, they
consist onely but of bowes and daggers (as I told you.)
But our fewe <HI>Portingalles</HI> that are there, are well lap|ped
in certaine iackets that are stuffed and basted with
bombast, and stitched and quilted very soundly, which


<PB N="55" REF="39">
keepe their armes very safe, and their bodies downe|wardes
as lowe as their knees: Their heades also are ar|med
with cappes made of the same stuffe, which doo
resist the shot of the arrow and the stroke of the dagger:
Besides that, they are girt with longe swords, and some
horsemen there are among them that carry speares for
their weapons. Now you must vnderstande that one
man on horsebacke, is of more worth then a hundred
<HI>Negroes,</HI> because the horsemen do affray them greatly:
&amp; especially of those that do discharge guns and pee|ces
of artillarie against them, they doo stande continu|ally
in an extreame bodily feare. So that these few be|ing
well armed, and cunningly and artificially ordered,
must needes ouercome the other, though they be very
many in number.</P>
<P>This kingdome of <HI>Angola,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kingdom of <HI>Angola</HI> ve|ry populous.</NOTE> is full of people beyonde
all credite: For euery man taketh as many wiues as hee
listeth, and so they multiply infinitely: But they doe
not vse so to do in the kingdome of <HI>Congo,</HI> which liueth
after the manner of the <HI>Christians.</HI> And so <HI>Signor Odo|ardo</HI>
did affirme and belieue, that the kingdome of <HI>An|gola</HI>
had a Million of fighting men, by reason that euery
man taking to him as many wiues as he woulde, begot
many children, and likewise because euery man doeth
willingly go to the warres in the seruice of his Prince.</P>
<P>This kingdome also is very rich in mines of <HI>Siluer,</HI> &amp;
most excellent <HI>Copper,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The commo|dities of <HI>An|gola.</HI></NOTE> and for other kindes of mettall
there is more in this kingdome then in any other coun|trey
of the world whatsoeuer. Fruitfull it is in all man|ner
of foode, and sundry sortes of cattell, and specially
for great heards of <HI>Kine.</HI> True it is, that this people do
loue <HI>Dogs</HI> flesh better then any other meate: &amp; for that


<PB N="56" REF="40">
that purpose they feede and fatten them, and then kill
them, and sell them in their open shambles. It is con|stantly
affirmed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Dogge</HI> solde for 220. duc|cates.</NOTE> that a great dogge accustomed to the
<HI>Bull</HI> was solde by exchaunge for xxij. slaues, which af|ter
the rate of x. <HI>Duckates</HI> a poll, were worth in all 220.
<HI>Duccates:</HI> in so high a price and account do they holde
that Creature.</P>
<P>The moneyes that are vsed in <HI>Angola,</HI> are much dif|ferent
from the <HI>Lumache</HI> of <HI>Congo:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The money of <HI>Angola,</HI></NOTE> for they of <HI>Angola</HI>
do vse beades of glasse, such as are made in <HI>Venice</HI> as big
as a Nut, and some of lesser quantity, and of diuers and
sundry colours and fashions. These doe the people of
<HI>Angola</HI> make, not onely to vse them for money, but also
for an ornament of their men and women, to weare a|bout
their neckes and their armes, and are called in
their tongue <HI>Anzolos:</HI> but when they are threeded
vpon a stringe lyke a payre of Beades, they call them
<HI>Mizanga.</HI></P>
<P>The King of <HI>Angola</HI> is by religion a Gentile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Religion of <HI>Angola.</HI></NOTE> and
worshippeth <HI>Idoles,</HI> and so doo all the people in his
kingdome. It is true, that hee hath greatly desired to
become a Christian, after the example of the King of
<HI>Congo.</HI> But because there hath not beene as yet any pos|sibility
to sende <HI>Priestes</HI> vnto him, that might illuminate
and instruct him, he remayneth still in darkenes. The

requesting that he would sende him some religious
persons to inform him in the Christian religio~: but the
King of <HI>Congo</HI> had none there that hee coulde spare, &amp;
therefore coulde sende him none. At this day, both
these kinges doo trafficke together, and are in amity


<PB N="57" REF="40">
one with another, the king of <HI>Angola</HI> hauing now clee|red

<P>The language of the people of <HI>Angola</HI> is all one with
the language of the people of <HI>Congo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The language of the people of <HI>Angola.</HI></NOTE> because (as wee

because it aboundeth in Woodes, in pastures and
in waters, more then any of the rest, by reason of the
many riuers that runne through it. And therefore the
countrey is (as it were) appropriated to nourishe and
breede such a kinde of beaste, as is indeede of an vnrea|sonable
bignesse.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An <HI>Elephantes</HI> foot 4. spanne broad.</NOTE> For <HI>Signor Odoardo</HI> tolde me, that hee
had oftentimes taken the measure of an <HI>Elephantes</HI> foot
in the dust,<NOTE PLACE="marg">You may find hereby what the bignes of the whole <HI>Ele|phant</HI> was&punc; if you will vse the Arte of Proportion, as <HI>Pithagoras</HI> did by the foot of <HI>Hercules, Aul.

This foot they cal <HI>Malo-Manzao</HI> that is to say, the <HI>Foot

ther haue been seen in our times, any of these creatures
that were far lesser in respect of the aforesaid hugenes,
you must vnderstande that they were but young, and
brought into those countreyes in their tender age, of
purpose to make them tame.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Elephant</HI> liueth 150. yeares.</NOTE> But in these quarters they

still in growing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">An <HI>Elephants</HI> tooth of 200. waight.</NOTE> And to confirme this truth hee
added, that he had seene and waighed diuerse of their
teeth (which are not of home, as some thinke) and their
waight amounted to 200. pounds a peece after the rate
of xii. ounces to euery pound. In the language of <HI>Congo</HI>


<PB N="64" REF="44">
the <HI>Elephants</HI> tooth is called <HI>Mene-Manzao,</HI> that is to

called <HI>Moana-Manzao,</HI> that is, a young <HI>Elephant.</HI> Their
eares are greater then the greatest Targattes that the
<HI>Turks</HI> vse to weare, in length sixe spans, in shape like an
Eg, &amp; towards their sholders they grow to be narrow|er
&amp; sharper. With their ears, &amp; with their tronke, and
with their tayle, they beate away the flies that trouble
them: yea and some haue leaft it in writing, that where
they cannot reach with their tronke, with their eares,
or with their taile, they will gather their skinne toge|ther,
and so nip the poore flies to death betweene the
wrincles.</P>
<P>They haue in their taile certaine hayres or bristles
as bigge as rushes or broome-spriggs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Certain haires in the <HI>Ele|phants</HI> taile, very precious.</NOTE> of a shining black
colour. The older they bee, the fayrer and stronger
they be, and of great price among them. For the people
of that countrey doe greatly esteeme them because the
noble men and women of the kingdome of <HI>Angola,</HI> and
of the <HI>Ambundi</HI> their neighbours doe vse to adorne and
bedecke their neckes withal, &amp; therefore do loue them,
for that they are indeede very fayre and rare, and grow
vpon so goodly a beast. They are very stronge, and like
a twined corde, so that if a man shall striue to breake
them asunder with both his handes, hee shall not bee
able with all his force and strength to cracke them, but
rather spoyle his handes with them. And for the cause
lately rehearsed, many there are, which waiting for the
<HI>Elephantes,</HI> when they ascend some steepe and narrowe
way, doe come behinde them, and with very sharpe
kniues cut of their tayles: the poor beast being not able
in those straits to turne back to reuenge it selfe, not with


<PB N="65" REF="44">
his tronke to reach his enemie. And this they do, onely
to haue those haires, which they sell for two or three
flaues a peece. Other light &amp; couragious persons there
are, that trusting much to their swiftnes in running, do
he in a waite, and set vpon the poore beastes behinde,
whiles they are in feeding, and at one blow attempt to
cut off their tayles, &amp; so endeauour to saue themselues
by running away in a rounde. For the greatnes of the
beast is such, as outright it is very swift, because it ma|keth
very large strides though in deede but slowe, and
in the plaine is farre quicker then any lustie horse: but
in turning rounde it looseth much time, and so the
huntseman escapeth in safetie. And therefore many
haue beene surprised and slaine by the <HI>Elephantes,</HI> that
haue sought to escape from them by running away out|right.</P>
<P>Our Auncestors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An errour of ancient wri|ters.</NOTE> being not well enformed in these
matters haue leaft in writing, that the <HI>Elephantes</HI> could
not ly down vpo~ the ground, but that they vsed to lean
themselues against a tree: which being before weake|ned
or sawed in sunder by the hunters, both the <HI>Ele|phantes</HI>
and the tree fel downe to the earth, and so were
taken. But <HI>Signor Odoardo</HI> affirmed vpon his credit, that
they lay downe vpon the ground, that they kneeled vp|on
their knees, and that they woulde with both their
fore-feete leape vpon the trees to feede on the leaues, &amp;
stoope downe to drink of the waters, that were in their
caues, and that they had their iointes as other creatures
haue, sauing that in some partes they do somewhat dif|fer
from others: as for example, fro~ the hoofes of their
fore-feete, vp to their shoulders, you shall not perceaue
that they haue any more then two ioyntes. In their


<PB N="66" REF="45">
feeding: they vse to shake and roote vp the great trees
with the force of their shoulders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of the <HI>Elepha~ts</HI> feeding.</NOTE> and strength of their
whole backes&punc; But the smaller trees they take between
both their teeth, and so bowe them and plucke them
downe, that they may feede vpon the leaues of them:
insomuch as sometimes they breake one of their teeth
with so doing. And this is the cause why you shall find
diuers of them in the fieldes that haue lost their teeth.
They chawe their meate with their short teeth, which
are not seene as their two long tuskes are: and they car|ry
it to their mouth by their long Snout, or Tronke,
which is to them in steed of an arme &amp; a hand. The tip
of their Tronke is fashioned &amp; diuided into little slits,
and (as it were) fingers, wherewith they will take vp
very small thinges, as Nuttes, and Strawes, and Berries,
&amp; so reach them to their mouth, as I <HI>Philippo Pigafetta</HI>
haue seene my selfe at <HI>Lisbone.</HI></P>
<P>The Females of these creatures doe beare their
broode in their wombe for the space of two yeares and
no more:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Shee-Ele|phant.</NOTE> And forasmuch as the younge <HI>Elephant</HI> can|not
so quickly bee brought vp, (for it groweth very
slowly) the milke is kept from it, and so it waxeth apt to
feede of it selfe. And therefore Mother <HI>Nature</HI> hath

making, but indeede he was grieuously bruised, so that

<P>The people of that Countrey haue not the skill to
tame these beastes. Whereby they might reape great
commodity and profite, for carrying their stuffe from
place to place for diuerse other good vses. But yet they
take them; by digging certaine deepe trenches in the
places, where they vse to pasture; which trenches are
very narrowe at the bottome, and broade aboue, to the
end the beast may not help himselfe, &amp; leape out when
he is fallen into them. These trenches they couer with
Soddes of earth, and grasse, and leaues, because the
beast shoulde not see their traine, but passing ouer them
remaine there entrenched. Whereupon the Gentle|man
beforenamed tolde mee, that hee had seene with
his owne eyes a very straunge and admirable thing in
<HI>Coanza,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A straunge effect of Na|ture.</NOTE> namely, that a younge <HI>Elephant</HI> following his
damme fell downe by chaunce into one of these pittes,
and after that shee coulde not with all her skill and
strength drawe him out of it, she buried him therein,
and couered him with earth, with branches, and with
bowes, insomuch as she filled the pit vp to the toppe, to
the ende that the hunters shoulde not enioy her calfe,
choosing rather to kill it her selfe, then to leaue it to the
mercie of the cruell huntsemen. This louing and kind
mother, not fearing the people (that stood round about
her, &amp; shouted against her, &amp; threatned her with sun|dryweapons,
&amp; vttered straunge clamours and noyses
to affray her, &amp; cast many fiers at her) but assuring her
selfe in her owne stronge and valiant nature, did labour
and toyle from morning till night, that she might draw
her calfe out of the pitte: and when shee founde that


<PB N="68" REF="46">
it was not possible for her to atchieue what she desired,
then shee couered it in manner as wee haue tolde you.</P>
<P>The <HI>Elephant</HI> is a very gentle beast, and trusteth
greatly in his natural strength. He feareth nothing, nor
hurteth any man that doth not trouble him:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The nature of the <HI>Elephant.</HI></NOTE> and haun|teth
neere to mens houses without doing any harme at
all. If he espie men that go in his walke, he wil not med|dle
with them, vnlesse they seeke to molest him: sauing
that sometimes peraduenture hee will gently with his
snowte hoyse them vpwardes into the ayre, whom he
meeteth withall in his way; and that is all the hurt hee
will doo vnto them. These <HI>Elephantes</HI> doo greatly de|light
in waters: and if a man be desirous to see them, his
best way is to lie somewhere nigh to the Riuers, and
Lakes, where they vse to haunt about noone tide, to
drinke, to refresh themselues, and to bathe their bodies
in the water: for there they will stande vp to their bel|lies,
and all the rest of their bodie, that is aboue the wa|ter,
they will wash all ouer with the water that they
snuffe vp into their snout for that purpose. And be|cause
there are so many foords &amp; pastures (as is said) in
the kingdome of <HI>Congo,</HI> therefore is there very great
store of these creatures in that countrey. For <HI>Signor O|doardo</HI>
affirmed, that in the way betweene <HI>Cazanze,</HI> &amp;
<HI>Loanda,</HI> in a little grassie valley hee had seene about a
hundred of them in a company, olde and young that
followed their dammes: and these were the first young
ones that euer hee saw till that day. And herewithall
you must vnderstand, that they vse to go together in
heardes, as <HI>Kine,</HI> and <HI>Camelles,</HI> and other such like gen|tle
Creatures doo, and not alone like <HI>Lions</HI> and other
such wilde beastes. Now the reason why this country


<PB N="69" REF="46">
aboundeth so in <HI>Iuory,</HI> is easy to be yeelded. For so many
<HI>Elephantes</HI> being bredde in that Region, they made no
account of that commodity in times past: but onely af|ter
that the <HI>Portingalles</HI> began to trafficke with those
countreyes, it grewe in estimation: and so hauing ga|thered
together in so many ages an infinite quantity
thereof, which they found in their fieldes, they haue
sould them till this day at a very good penniworth.</P>
<P>It is not knowen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rinoceros.</NOTE> whether there be in that countrey
any other beast that is so big as an <HI>Elephant</HI> is, nor whe|ther
there breed therein any <HI>Rinoceros,</HI> which is a Crea|tures
as bigge indeede as the <HI>Elephant,</HI> and in <HI>India</HI> is cal|led
a <HI>Bada.</HI> But yet there are brought into the countries
of the <HI>Anzichi</HI> some of their hornes that growe vpon
their noses, that are both of great value &amp; estimation, &amp;
also vsed for the help of diuers diseases. So that it is very
credible and likely, that there are some of them to bee
founde in those quarters.</P>
<P>There are in the Region of the <HI>Anzichi Lions</HI> also,
like the <HI>Lions</HI> that breed in other partes of the worlde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lyons.</NOTE>
but they doo not vse to haunt the Region of <HI>Bamba:</HI>
But in <HI>Bamba</HI> there are very great store of <HI>Tigres,</HI>
which are of the very same shape that those in <HI>Florence</HI>
are,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tygres.</NOTE> which <HI>Signor Odoardo</HI> saw there, and testified to be
very <HI>Tygres</HI> indeed. He tolde mee also of a notable cu|stome
which they haue: And that is, that they will not
set vpon any men that are white, but onely such as are
blacke: And it hath beene found, that when the white
and the blacke haue slept together in the night time,
they haue slayne the blacke to deuoure them, and spa|red
the white. When they are hungry they will bee so
bolde as to fetch cattell euen out of the yardes that


<PB N="70" REF="47">
are about the houses without any feare at all, when
they cannot finde any victuailes abroade in the fieldes.
They are very daungerous and hurtfull to all kindes
of Creatures whatsoeuer they be, and in that language
they are called <HI>Engoi.</HI> They are as fierce and cruell
beastes as the <HI>Lion,</HI> and roare as the <HI>Lion</HI> doth. They
are also altogether like the <HI>Lion,</HI> sauing onely in the co|lour
of their haire; for the <HI>Tygre</HI> is spotted, but the <HI>Lyon</HI>
is all of one colour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of taking the tame <HI>Tygres.</HI></NOTE> They vse to take and kill these <HI>Ty|gres</HI>
after diuers manners. For besides that, which hath
beene before spoken, they poyson them with <HI>Sublimate</HI>
or some other venome, mingled with flesh which is laid
for them. Or els they tie young <HI>Goates</HI> at certaine lines
made like snares, and fastned about the stocke of a tree,
so that when the beast commeth to her pray, the en|gine
openeth it selfe, and the more the beast striueth
withall, the more it is intangled, and so at last is hanged
therein. Another way they haue to kill them, that is
with arrowes, with Iauelins, and with Arcubuses. It
is a Creature very harmeful, both to the <HI>Negroes</HI> them|selues,
and also to their flockes of sheepe and heards of
cattell.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A tame <HI>Ty|ger.</HI></NOTE> Notwithstanding <HI>Signor Odoardo</HI> tolde me, that
he had gotten one of them, that was fifteene dayes old,
and he brought it vp with Goates milke: which be|ing
afterwardes growen bigger would followe him like
a dogge: and although it were very tame, yet it would
not willingly suffer any other to touch it besides his
maister. He woulde also roare mightily, and when he
was angry, his eies wold looke very terribly &amp; fearfully.
But in processe of time this <HI>Tygre</HI> killed a <HI>Dogge,</HI> belong|ing
to the house, and also a <HI>Zebra,</HI> that were very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">

He reported moreouer, that the <HI>Mostacchios</HI> of the <HI>Ty|gre</HI>
are helde in that Region to be mortall poyson: for
being giuen in meates, it procureth a man to die, as it
were in a madnesse: And therefore the king doth pu|nish
all those that bring him a <HI>Tygres</HI> skinne without the
<HI>Mostacchios.</HI></P>
<P>There breedeth likewise in this Countrey another
Creature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Zebra&punc;</HI></NOTE> which they call a <HI>Zebra,</HI> commonly founde
also in certaine Prouinces of <HI>Barbary</HI> and <HI>Africa:</HI> which
although it be altogether made like a great <HI>Mule,</HI> yet is
not a <HI>Mule</HI> indeed, for it beareth young ones. It hath
a most singular skinne, and peculiar from all other crea|tures.
For from the ridge of the chine downe towards
the bellie, it is straked with rowes of three colours,
blacke, white, and browne Bay, about the breadth of
three fingers a peece, and so meet againe together in a
circle, euery rowe, with his owne colour. So that the
necke, and the head; and the Mane (which is not great)
and the eares, and all the legges are so interchaunged
with these colours, and in such manner and order, as
without all faile, if the first strake beginne with white,
then followeth the second with blacke, &amp; in the thirde
place the Bay: &amp; so another course beginning in white
endeth still in Bay. And this rule is generally and infal|libly
obserued ouer all the body. The tayle is like the
tayle of a <HI>Mule,</HI> of a Morell colour, but yet it is well co|loured,
and hath a glistring glosse. The feet like the feet
of a <HI>Mule,</HI> and so are the hooffes. But touching the rest
of her carriage and qualities, she is very lusty and plea|saunt
as a horse: and specially in going, and in running
she is so light &amp; so swift that it is admirable. In somuch


<PB N="74" REF="49">
as in <HI>Portingale</HI> and in <HI>Castile</HI> also, it is commonly vsed
(as it were for a prouerbe) <HI>As swift as a Zebra,</HI> when they
will signifie an exceeding quickenes. These creatures
are all wilde, they breede euery yeare, and are there in
such aboundance that they are innumerable. If they
were made tame, they woulde serue to runne and to
drawe for the warres, and for many other good vses, as
well as the best horses that are. So that Mother <HI>Nature</HI>
seemeth to haue sufficiently prouided in euery country
for the commodity and necessity of man, with diuers
sortes of Creatures, of nourishments, and temperature
of ayre, to the ende hee shoulde want nothing. And
therefore they hauing no horses at all in the whole
Kingdome of <HI>Congo,</HI> nor any skill to vse their oxen
to the yoke, or to the packsaddle, that they might ey|ther
be drawen or carryed, nor to tame their <HI>Zebraes</HI>

of their beastes, that might transport them from
place to place:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The manner of the carry|ing of the <HI>Moci-Conghi.</HI></NOTE> Euen very necessity hath taught them to
vse men in steed of labouring cattel. For either they lay
the~selues al along in certain Litters (as it were) or els set
themselues vpright, with shadows ouer them to keepe
them from the Sunne, and so they cause themselues to
be carried too and fro, by their slaues, or by other men
that for wages are alwaies ready at Poste-houses to that
purpose. They that meane to iourney with speede, do
take with them many slaues, and when the first num|ber

no more respect to one then to another, so that he

may in compasse amount
to the space of twenty miles about, doeth depende
wholly of the king of <HI>Congo</HI> himselfe, wee will place it
in a seuerall regiment, and intreate of it by it selfe.</P>
<P>This cittie is called <HI>San Saluatore,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The chief Cit|ty called <HI>San-Saluadore.</HI></NOTE> or <HI>Saint Sauiours,</HI>
and in times past in that country language it was called


<PB N="108" REF="67">
<HI>Banza,</HI> which generally signifieth the Court, where
the king or the Gouernour doeth ordinarily soiourne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The situation of the Citty.</NOTE>
It is seated about 150. miles from the sea, vpon a great
and a high Mountaine, being almost all of a rocke, but
yet hauing a veyne of iron in it, whereof they haue
great vse in their housing. This mountaine hath in the
toppe of it a great plaine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The moun|taine where|vpon it stan|deth.</NOTE> very well manured and fur|nished
with houses and villages, contayning in circuite
about ten miles, where there doeth dwell and liue the
number of a hundred thousand persons.</P>
<P>The soile is fruitfull,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The soile, the ayre, the wa|ters and the cattell.</NOTE> and the ayre fresh, holesome
and pure: there are great store of springes, of indiffe|rent
good water to drinke, and at certaine times doo
not harme any man: and of all sortes of cattell great
aboundance. The toppe of the mountaine is seuered
and distinguished from all the rest of the hill which is
about it, and therefore the <HI>Portingalles</HI> doe call it <HI>The
Otheiro,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Otheiro.</NOTE> that is to say, <HI>a Viewe,</HI> or a <HI>Watch Tower,</HI> or a
<HI>Singular height,</HI> from whence you may take a sight of
all the Champeigne round about. Onely towardes the
<HI>East,</HI> and towardes the Riuer, it is verye steepe and
rockie.</P>
<P>For two causes did the first Princes of this King|dome
place this habitation in the foresaide <HI>Height</HI> of
this Mountaine.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The reason why they built in this place.</NOTE> First, because it lyeth in the very
middest and (as it were) in the <HI>Center</HI> of all the Realme,
from whence he may presently send ayde to any part
of his Kingdom that may stand in neede of reliefe: &amp;
secondly because it is situated in a Territory that is by
Nature mounted aloft, hauing a very good ayre, and of
greate safetie: for it cannot be forced. By the chiefe
common high way, that goeth vp to the Citie, and


<PB N="109" REF="67">
looketh towardes the Sea, being distant from thence
150. Miles (as hath bene told you) which way is very
large and competent, though it go somewhat about
incompasse, you shall ascende (fiue Myles from the
bottom to the toppe of the Mountayne.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fiue miles fro~ the bottome of the hill to the toppe.</NOTE> At the foote
thereof on the East syde there runneth a Riuer, where|vnto
the women doe descend by the space of a myles
walke to washe their clothes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A riuer at the hill foote</NOTE> In diuerse other partes
thereof there are sundry valleyes planted &amp; manured:
neyther do they suffer any part of the countrey there|aboutes
to be left vntilled or vnvsed, because it is the
countrey where the Court remaineth.</P>
<P>The Cittie is seated in a corner or angle of the hill
towards the <HI>Southeast,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The particu|cular situation of the Cittie.</NOTE> which <HI>Don Alfonso</HI> the first chri|stian
king did compasse about with walles, and gaue
vnto the <HI>Portingalles</HI> a seuerall place for themselues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A seuerall place for the <HI>Portingalles.</HI></NOTE> shut
vp likewise within walles. Then did he also inclose his
owne pallace and the Kinges howsen with another
wall, and in the middest betweene these two enclosures
left a great space of ground where the principal Church
was built,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The principall Church and market place.</NOTE> with a faire market place before it. The
doores and gates aswell of the lodginges of the Lords,
as of the <HI>Portingalles</HI> inhabitations, do open on the side
of the said Church. For in the vppermost ende of the
market place do diuers great Lords of the Court dwel,
and behinde the Church doeth the market place runne
into a narrow street, where there is also a gate, and be|yond
that gate many houses towardes the <HI>East.</HI> With|out
these walles, (which do inclose the kinges houses,
and the Cittie of the <HI>Portingalles)</HI> there are a number
of other buildinges, erected by diuers Lordes, e|uery
man making his seuerall choice of the place


<PB N="110" REF="68">
which he thinketh most fit &amp; conuenient for his dwel|ling
neere vnto the Court. So that the greatnes of
this Citie cannot well be determined or limited. Be|yond
these walles also, that thus do compasse this Cit|ty;
there is a great champaigne plaine, full of villages,
and sundry pallaces, where euery Lorde possesseth (as
it were) a whole Towne within him selfe. The circuite
of the <HI>Portingalles</HI> cittie contayneth about a mile: and
the kings housen as much. The walles are very thick:
the gates are not shutte in the night time, neyther is
there any watch or ward kept therein.</P>
<P>And although that plaine doeth lie verie high &amp;
aloft,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good store of water.</NOTE> yet is there great aboundance of waters in it, so
that there is no want thereof. But the Court and the
<HI>Portingalles</HI> Cittie do al drinke of a certaine fountaine,
that springeth continually, towardes the <HI>North,</HI> and
lyeth downe the hill, as farre as a Gunne will shoote:
And from hence they doe fetch all their water, and
bring it to the Cittie in vesselles of wood, of earth and
of leather, vpon the backes of their slaues.</P>
<P>All this plaine is very fruitfull,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The plaine very fruitfull. Seuerall sortes of graine.</NOTE> and well manured:
It hath meadowes full of grasse, and trees that are al|wayes
greene. It beareth sundrie sortes of graine, but

it giue place to our wheat in any sort, sauing that they
doe not celebrate the <HI>Sacramente</HI> with it. Of these
graines there now is great store ouer all the Kingdom


<PB N="111" REF="68">

<P>There are moreouer diuerse and sundry sortes of

hee had seene from a kernell of the fruit of a <HI>Pome-Citrone,</HI>

sweet in smell, and of good nourishment. In these
plaines there growe likewise sundry kindes of <HI>Palme-trees:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Diuers kindes of <HI>Palme-trees</HI></NOTE>

therevpon they vse in <HI>Spaine</HI> to shewe their children a

but of a more straunge and singular property: For it
yeeldeth <HI>Oyle,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The oyle of <HI>Palme.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Wyne, Vineger, Fruite,</HI> and <HI>Breade.</HI> The
<HI>Oyle</HI> is made of the Shale of the fruite, and is of the co|lour
and substance of butter, sauing that it is somewhat
greenishe. They vse it, as other people do vse <HI>Oyle</HI>
and butter, and it will burne like oile. They annoint
their bodies withall, and besides it is very good to eate.
They presse it out of the fruite, as oyle is pressed out of
the <HI>Oliues,</HI> and then they boyle it, and so preserue it.
The bread is made of the stone of the fruit it self,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bread of <HI>Palme</HI></NOTE> which
is like to an <HI>Almond,</HI> but somewhat harder: and within
the same is there a certaine kernell or pith, which is

liquor like milke, which at the first is sweet, but after|wardes
sowre, and in processe of time becommeth ve|ry

with grauell or stone in the bladder. It will make them

<P>_THe K. of <HI>Portingal Don Giouanni</HI>
the seco~d,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first tra|fficke of the <HI>Portingalles</HI> into <HI>Congo.</HI></NOTE> being desirous to di|scouer
the <HI>East Indies,</HI> sent forth
diuers ships by the coast of <HI>A|frica</HI>
to search out this Nauiga|tion,
who hauing founde the

we haue made mention before, and there they had
good trafficke, and tryed the people to bee very cour|teous
and kinde. Afterwards he sent fourth (for the
same purpose) certaine other vesselles, to entertaine
this trafficke with <HI>Congo,</HI> who finding the trade there
to be so free and profitable, and the people so frendly,
leaft certaine <HI>Portingalles</HI> behinde them, to learne the
language,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mani Sogno</HI> the K. vncle entertaineth the <HI>Portingals.</HI></NOTE> and to trafficke with them: among whom
one was a Masse-priest. These <HI>Portingalles</HI> conuersing
familiarly with the Lorde of <HI>Sogno,</HI> who was vncle to


<PB N="119" REF="72">
the King, and a man well stroken in yeares, dwelling
at that time in the Port of <HI>Praza</HI> (which is in the mouth
of <HI>Zaire)</HI> were very well entertained and esteemed by
the Prince, and reuerenced as though they had beene
earthly <HI>Gods,</HI> and descended downe from heauen into
those Countries. But the <HI>Portingalles</HI> told them that
they were men as themselues were, and professors of
<HI>Christianitie.</HI> And when they perceyued in how great
estimation the people held them, the foresaide <HI>Priest</HI> &amp;
others beganne to reason with the Prince touching the
Christian religion, and to shew vnto them the errors of
the Pagan superstition,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mani-Sogno</HI> conuerted &amp; become a Christian.</NOTE> and by little and little to teach
them the faith which wee professe, insomuch as that
which the <HI>Portingalles</HI> spake vnto them, greatly pleased
the Prince, and so he became conuerted.</P>
<P>With this confidence and good spirit, the prince
of <HI>Sogno</HI> went to the Court, to enforme the King of the
true doctrine of the Christian <HI>Portingalles,</HI> and to en|courage
him that he would embrace the Christian Re|ligion
which was so manifest, and also so holesome for
his soules health. Herevpon the king commanded
to call the Priest to Court, to the end he might himself
treat with him personally,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Congo</HI> promi|seth to becom a Christian.</NOTE> and vnderstand the truth of
that which the Lord of <HI>Sogno</HI> had declared vnto him.
Whereof when he was fully enformed, he conuerted
and promised that he would become a Christian.</P>
<P>And nowe the <HI>Portingall</HI> shippes departed from
<HI>Congo,</HI> and returned into <HI>Portingall:</HI> and by them did
the King of <HI>Congo</HI> write to the King of <HI>Portingall, Don
Giouanni</HI> the second, with earnest request, that he would
send him some Priestes, with all other orders and ce|remonies
to make him a Christian. The Priest also


<PB N="120" REF="73">
that remayned behind, had written at large touching
this busines, and gaue the King ful information of all
that had happened,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The K. of <HI>Por|tingall</HI> sendeth Priestes to the K. of <HI>Congo</HI> to instruct him.</NOTE> agreeable to his good pleasure.
And so the King tooke order for sundry religious per|sons,
to be sent vnto him accordingly, with all orna|ments
for the Church and other seruice, as <HI>Crosses</HI> and
<HI>Images:</HI> so that hee was throughly furnished with all
thinges that were necessary and needefull for such an
action.</P>
<P>In the meane while the Prince of <HI>Sogno</HI> ceased not
day and night to discourse with the Portingall priest,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mani-Sogno</HI> promoteth the Christian Religion.</NOTE>
whom he kept in his owne house, and at his owne ta|ble,
aswell that hee might learne the Christian faith
himselfe, as also instruct the people therein: so that he
began to fauour christianitie with all his power. And
forasmuch as the Christian Religion had nowe taken
roote and begun to bud in those Countries, and for
that both the people, &amp; also the king himselfe did con|tinue
in their earnest desire to purge themselues from
that abhominable superstition, he did instantly deale
with the Priest, that he wold proceed in the sowing &amp;
dispearsing of the Christian doctrine, as much as hee
could. And in this good affection did they wait for
the <HI>Portingall</HI> shippes, that shoulde bring them all pro|uision
for baptisme; and other thinges therevnto ap|pertayning.</P>
<P>At the last the shippes of <HI>Portingall</HI> arriued with the
expected prouisions (which was in the yeare of our
saluation 1491) and landed in the port which is in the
mouth of the Riuer <HI>Zaire.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ships re|turne from <HI>Portingall. 1491. Mani-Sogno</HI> &amp; his traine entertayneth the <HI>Portingals.</HI></NOTE> The Prince of <HI>Sogno</HI> with

gentlemen ran downe to meete them, and entertained


<PB N="121" REF="73">
the <HI>Portingalles</HI> in most courteous manner, and so con|ducted
the~ to their lodgings. The next day following
according to the direction of the Priest that remayned
behinde,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mani-Sogno</HI> buildeth a Church.</NOTE> the Prince caused a kinde of Church to bee
builded, with the bodies and braunches of certayne
trees, which he in his owne person, with the helpe of
his seruantes, most deuoutly had felled in the woode.
And when it was couered, they erected therein three
Altars, in the worshippe and reuerence of the most ho|ly
<HI>Trinitie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mani Sogno</HI> &amp; his sonne baptized.</NOTE> and there was baptised himselfe and his

and his child by the name of <HI>Anthonie,</HI> be|cause
that Sainte is the Protector of the Cittie of
<HI>Lisbone.</HI></P>
<P>Now if any man here demande of me, what names
the people of these Countries had,<NOTE PLACE="marg">What names the people of <HI>Congo</HI> had be|fore they were christened.</NOTE> before they recey|ued
Christianitie: of a truth it will seeme incredible
that I must answere them, that is to say, that the men
and women had no proper names agreeable to reaso|nable
Creatures, but the common names of Plantes, of
Stones, of Birdes and of Beastes. But the Princes &amp;
Lordes had their denominations from the places and
states which they gouerned. As for example the fore|said
Prince, which was the first Christian in <HI>Congo,</HI> was
called <HI>Mani-Sogno,</HI> that is to say, the <HI>Prince of Sogno,</HI> &amp;
when hee was christened, was called <HI>Emanuel,</HI> but at
this day they haue all in generall such Christian names
as they haue learned of the <HI>Portingalles.</HI></P>
<P>After a Masse was celebrated and songe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A sermon co~|tayning the summe of Christian Re|ligion.</NOTE> one of the
Priestes that came from <HI>Portingall</HI> went vp, and made
a briefe Sermon in the <HI>Portingall</HI> language, declaring
the summe of the new Religion, &amp; faith of the Gospel


<PB N="122" REF="74">
which they had receiued. This sermon, the Priest
that was left behinde, hauing nowe learned the <HI>Congo</HI>
speech, did more at large expounde to the Lords that
were in the Church: for the church could not possibly
holde the innumerable multitude of the people that
were there gathered together,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mani Sogno</HI> rehearseth the Sermon to his people.</NOTE> at the conuersion of
their Prince: who afterwardes came abroade vnto
them, and rehearsed the whole sermon, with great loue
and charitie, mouing and exhorting them to imbrace
likewise the true beliefe of the Christian doctrine.</P>
<P>When this was done, all the <HI>Portingals</HI> put themselues
on their way towards the Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Portingals</HI> go to the Court to bap|tise the king.</NOTE> to baptise the King,
who with a most feruent longing attended the same.
And the Gouernour of <HI>Sogno</HI> tooke order that many of
his Lordes should wait vpon them with Musicke, and
singing, and other signes of wonderfull reioysing, be|sides
diuers slaues which he gaue them to carry their
stuffe, commanding also the people, that they should
prepare all manner of victuaill to be ready in the streets
for them. So great was the number of people, that
ran and met together to beholde them, as the whole
Champaigne seemed to be in a manner couered with
them, and they all did in great-kindnes entertaine and
welcome the <HI>Portingall Christians,</HI> with singing and
sounding of Trompets, and Cimballes, and other in|strumentes
of that Countrey. And it is an admirable
thing to tell you, that all the streetes and high wayes,
that reach from the Sea, to the Citty of <HI>Saint Sauiours,</HI>
being one hundred and fiftie miles, were all cleansed
and swept, and aboundantly furnished with all man|ner
of victuaile and other necessaries for the <HI>Portingals.</HI>
In deede they do vse in those countries, when the king


<PB N="123" REF="74">
or the principall Lordes go abroade, to cleanse their
waies and make them handsome: and therefore much
the rather vpon this speciall occasion, when the <HI>Portin|gals,</HI>
whom they reuerenced as though they had bene
some of the old <HI>Heroes,</HI> did purchase for their King the
Iewell of Religion, and saluation of his soule, and ge|nerally
for euery one of them the cleere knowledge of
God, and of eternall life.</P>
<P>Three dayes iourney from the place whence they
departed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Courtiers of <HI>Congo</HI> meet the <HI>Portingals.</HI></NOTE> they descried the kinges Courtiers, that
came to meet them, to present them with fresh victu|ailes,
and to doe them honour: and so from place to
place they encountred other Lordes, that for the same
purpose were sent by the King to receiue the Christi|ans,
who were the messengers and bringers of so great
a ioy. When they were come within three miles neere
to the Cittie, all the Court came to entertaine and wel|come
the <HI>Portingalles,</HI> with all manner of pompe and
ioyfulnes, and with musicke and singing; as in those
countreyes is vsed vppon their solemnest feast-daies.
And so great was the multitude of people, which a|bounded
in the streets, that there was neyther tree, nor
hillocke, higher then the rest, but it was loaden with
those that were runne forth and assembled to viewe
these strangers, which brought vnto them this newe
law of their saluation. The King himselfe attended
them at the gate of his pallace,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king him selfe recceyueth them:</NOTE> in a Throne of estate e|rected
vpon a high scaffold, where hee did publikely
receiue them, in such manner and sorte as the auncient
kinges of that Realme accustomed to doe, when any
Embassadours came vnto him, or when his tributes
were paied him, or when any other such Royall cere|monies


<PB N="124" REF="75">
were performed.</P>
<P>And first of all, the Embassador declared the Embas|sage
of the King of <HI>Portingall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Portingal</HI> Embassadour declareth his Embassage.</NOTE> which was expounded
and interpreted by the foresaid Priest, that was the
principall authour of the conuersion of those people.
After the embassage was thus deliuered,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The K. reioy|ceth at the Embassage.</NOTE> the King ray|sed
himselfe out of his seate, and standinge vpright
vppon his feete, did both with his countenaunce and
speech shew most euident signes of the great ioy, that
he had conceyued for the comming of the Christians,
and so sate downe againe.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The people reioyce at it.</NOTE> And incontinently all the
people with shouting, and sounding their trumpets, &amp;
singing, and other manifest arguments of reioycing,
did approue the kinges wordes, and shewed their ex|ceeding
good liking of this Embassage. And further
in token of obedience, they did three times prostrate
themselues vpon the grounde, and cast vp their feete,
according to the vse of those kingdomes, thereby al|lowing
and commending the action of their king, and
most affectionately accepting of the Gospell, which
was brought vnto them from the Lorde God by the
handes of those religious persons.</P>
<P>Then the king tooke view of all the presentes that
were sent him by the King of <HI>Portingall,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The K. view|eth the Pre|sents sent vnto him by the K. of <HI>Portingall.</HI></NOTE> and the <HI>Ve|stimentes</HI>
of the <HI>Priestes,</HI> and the Ornamentes of the

the <HI>Images</HI> of <HI>Saintes,</HI> and the <HI>Streamers,</HI> and
the <HI>Banners,</HI> and all the rest, and with incredible atten|tion,
caused the meaning of euery one of them to bee
declared vnto him, one by one. And so withdrewe
himselfe, and lodged the <HI>Embassadour</HI> in a pallace
made ready of purpose for him, and all the rest were


<PB N="125" REF="75">
placed in other houses of seuerall Lordes, where they
were furnished with all plentie and ease.</P>
<P>The day following the King caused all the <HI>Por|tingalles</HI>
to bee assembled together in priuate:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Consultation among the Portingals for the Christe|ning of the K. &amp; for the buil|ding of a Church.</NOTE> where
they deuised of the course that was to be taken for the
christening of the king, and for effecting the full con|uersion
of the people to the christian faith. And af|ter
sundry discourses, it was resolued and concluded,
that first of all a <HI>Church</HI> shoulde be builded, to the end
that the christening, and other ceremonies therevnto
belonging, might be celebrated therein with the more
solemnity: and in the meane while the king and the
Court should be taught and instructed in the <HI>Christi|an
Religion.</HI> The king presently commaunded, that
with all speed prouision should be made of all manner
of stuffe necessary for this building, as <HI>Timber, Stone,
Lime</HI> and <HI>Bricke,</HI> according to the direction and ap|poiutment
of the <HI>Worke-maisters</HI> and <HI>Masons,</HI> which
for that purpose were brought out of <HI>Portingall.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An insurrecti|on raised by the Deuill, to hinder the progresse of Christian Re|ligion.</NOTE></P>
<P>But the <HI>Deuill</HI> who neuer ceaseth to crosse all good
and holy proceedinges, raysed new dissentions, and
conspiracies, and lettes against this promoting of the
<HI>Christian Faith,</HI> which in deede began to ouerthrowe,
and destroy the power that hee had long helde in that
Realme, and in steed thereof to plant the most health|full
tree of the <HI>Crosse,</HI> and the worship of the <HI>Gospell.</HI>
And this hee did by procuring a rebellion among cer|taine
people of the <HI>Anzichi,</HI> and of <HI>Anzicana,</HI> which
dwell vpon both the bankes of the Riuer <HI>Zaire,</HI> from
the foresaid falles vpwardes, to the great <HI>Lake,</HI> and are
subiect and belonging to the King of <HI>Congo.</HI> Now this
monstrous Riuer being! restrained and kept backe by


<PB N="126" REF="76">
these falles, doeth swell there mightily, and spreadeth
it selfe abroade in a very large and deepe channell. In
the breadth whereof there are many <HI>Islandes,</HI> some
small and some great, so that in some of them, there
may be maintayned about thirtie thousande persons.
In these <HI>Islandes</HI> and in other places adioyninge to the
riuers thereaboutes, did the people make an insurrecti|on,
and renounced their obedience to the king, and
slew the Gouernours that hee had sent thether to rule.</P>
<P>And all this was done by the <HI>Deuill,</HI> of purpose to
interrupt the propagation of Christianity, which was
now begunne, and to hinder it by the meanes of this
rebellion. But the King, by the inspiration of God,
prouided a good remedy for this mischiefe, and sent
thether his eldest sonne,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mani-Sundi</HI> goeth against the rebelles.</NOTE> called <HI>Mani-Sundi,</HI> within
whose Prouince that countrey lyeth. And yet after|wardes
the trouble and tumult fell out to be so great &amp;
daungerous, that the king must needes go himselfe in
person to pacifie these broyles: howbeit hee resolued
to be baptised before his going, and so was enforced to
forbeare the building of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Stone,</HI> and with
all speed in steed thereof to erect one of timber, which
<HI>Church</HI> hee in his owne person with the aduice of the
<HI>Portingalles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The K. build|eth in haste a Church of timber.</NOTE> did accomplish in such manner and sort as
it ought to be, and therein did receiue the <HI>Sacrament</HI>
of holy <HI>Baptisme,</HI> and was named <HI>Don Giouanni,</HI> and his

<P>But here it is to be noted, that all these stirs and re|bellion
of the people aforesaide, arose by the cunning
sleight &amp; instigation of the Deuill, &amp; not of the poore


<PB N="127" REF="76">

<P>But see the <HI>Deuill</HI> once againe, the vtter enemy of

these wars, he incensed the mind of the <HI>Kings second Son,</HI>
that hee woulde not agree to receiue the new <HI>Keligion</HI>
which his <HI>Father,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mani-Pango</HI> resisteth the Gospell.</NOTE> his <HI>Mother,</HI> his <HI>Brother</HI> so many o|ther
Lords had imbraced, sowing his Cockle &amp; Darnel
not onely in him, but also in many other Lordes that
fauoured him, who being addicted rather to the sen|sualitie
of the flesh, then the puritie of the minde, resi|sted
the Gospel, which beganne now to be preached,
especially in that Commaundement, wherein it is for|bidden
that a man should haue any mo wiues but one.
A matter that among them was more harde and diffi|cult
to be receyued, then any other Commandement
whatsoeuer, because they were vsed to take as many
wiues as they would. And thus the two brethren
being diuided betweene themselues, eyther of them
did stiffly maintaine his seuerall opinion. The eldest
brother <HI>Don Alfonso,</HI> did with great feruencie, defende
<HI>Christianitie,</HI> &amp; burned all the <HI>Idoles</HI> that were with|in

because he was Gouernour of the Countrey of
<HI>Pango)</HI> did resist it mightely, and had gotten the great|est
part of the principall Lordes of <HI>Pango</HI> to bee on his
side. For there were diuers of the newe christned
Lordes, whose Ladies seeing themselues seperated, and
forlorne of their <HI>Husbande-Lordes</HI> by force of the <HI>Chri|stian

vnited themselues with <HI>Mani-Pango,</HI> who was nowe
departed into the Prouince of his owne Gouernment,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mani-Pango</HI> rebelleth against his brother.</NOTE>
and while his father liued, was wholly employed in

truce with his enemies, and gathering together a great

lead with him almost all the whole Realme, which in

besides some few <HI>Portingalles,</HI> which by chance
arriued there at that time.</P>
<P>All these people were indeed too few for such an

attempt, but became very doubtfull and timorous,


<PB N="135" REF="80">
by reason of the great power, that <HI>Mani-Pango</HI> brought
with him. But the king trusting confidently in his
strong faith, and in the Celestiall aide and assistance:
comforted and strengthened his souldiers by all the
meanes he could, and so did the good olde Lorde his
vncle, who ceased not, both night and day, with words
and deeds to encourage that smal number, which they
had, to expect and endure the assaults of their aduersa|ries,
with all manhoode and courage, assuring them,
that God would bee their helpe and succour. Thus
while they attended the procedinges of their enemies,
<HI>Mani-Pango</HI> and his forces set forwardes to the be|sieging
of the Cittie, with so great a noise of warlicke
instrumentes, and cries, and shoutinges, and terrible
threatninges, that the poore fewe, which were in the
Cittie, aswel Christians as others, fainted in their harts,
and failed in their courage, and came and presented
themselues before the king, saying, that hee had not
power enough to resist so power-full an enemie, and
therefore they thought it better for him to growe to
some concorde and composition, and to abandon the
new <HI>Religion,</HI> which hee had lately begun to professe,
to the ende hee might not fall into the handes of his
cruell aduersaries.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The king to his souldiers.</NOTE> But the king being resolute, and
full of religious constancie, reproued their cowardise,
<HI REND="margQuotes">and called them dastardes, and base people, and willed
them, if they had any mind or desire to forsake him, &amp;
go to the enemie, that they should so doe: As for him|selfe

doubt but assuredly trust, though not with the possibi|litie
or strength of man, yet with the fauour of God, to
vanquish and ouercome that innumerable multitude.


<PB N="136" REF="81">
And therefore he would not request them eyther to
ioyne with him, or to put their liues in hazarde against

thereon.</HI></P>
<P>But they for all this speech became neuer a whit the

saue themselues. Now they were scarse out of the

good fortune, they met with the good old Lord <HI>Mani-Sogno,</HI>
who with some few of his followers had beene
abroade to surueigh the enemies Campe,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mani-Sogno</HI> meeteth with them.</NOTE> and to make
prouision for such thinges as were necessary in such an
action: To him they declared all that they had before
declared to the King, <HI>That they thought it to bee a point
of expresse madnesse, to put their liues and goods in daunger
with so fewe people against an infinite multitude, and that
without all doubt it were a safer way to compounde with the
enemie, and so saue themselues.</HI> The good Lorde with
great pietie and Christian valour aunswered them, that
they should not so quickly fall into dispaire; but (as the
king had tould them before) they should looke vpon
<HI>Iesus Christ</HI> the Sauiour of the worlde, whose faith and
religion they had so lately and with so great zeale gay|ned
and purchased: who also most assuredly and vn|doubtedly
would succour and defend those that were
his. And so entreated them, that they woulde not like
rash headed people chaunge their mindes from that
holy doctrine, which they had with such feruency of
late receyued, adding moreouer, that they had not to
fight with a straunge nation, nor with a people that

of that trauell, he would not by any meanes giue ouer
his labour, vntill such time as all the <HI>Church</HI> was whol|ly
built and finished.</P>
<P>The Kingdome being thus pacified, and all things


<PB N="145" REF="85">
well established, the king <HI>Don Alfonso</HI> tooke order, that
they should presently go in hande with the fabricke of
the principall <HI>Church,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The building of the Church called <HI>Saint Crosses.</HI></NOTE> called <HI>S. Crosses,</HI> which was so na|med
of the <HI>Crosse</HI> that was there planted (as wee tolde
you before) and also because vpon the feast day of the
<HI>Holy Crosse</HI> the first stone was layed in the foundation
thereof. Moreouer hee commaunded that the men
should bring stones, and the weomen shoulde fetch
sand from the Riuer, for the furthering of this worke.
The king woulde needes bee the first <HI>Porter</HI> himselfe,
and vppon his owne shoulders brought the first basket
of stones, which he cast into the foundation, and the
<HI>Queene</HI> her basket of sande likewise, thereby giuing
an example to the Lordes and the Ladies of the Court
to do the like, and to encourage and harten the people
in so holy an action. And so this fabricke being fur|thered
by so good worke-maisters and workemen, in
a very short time was fully finished, and therein were
celebrated <HI>Masses,</HI> and other diuine seruice, with great
solemnitie, besides a number of Lords and others that
were there baptised and christened: so that the multi|tude
of such as came to bee partakers of the <HI>Holy Bap|tisme</HI>
abounded so greatly, that there were not <HI>Priestes</HI>
enough to execute that office.</P>
<P>After this the king dispatched away the <HI>Portingall
Embassadour,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">K. <HI>Alfonso</HI> dis|patcheth the <HI>Portingal</HI> Em|bassadour, &amp; mother of his owne into <HI>Portingall&punc;</HI></NOTE> who till this time had remained at the

himselfe and to his <HI>Embassadour,</HI> to the ende that they
should learne both the doctrine of the <HI>Christians</HI> in <HI>Por|tingall,</HI>
and also their language, and further declare vn|to


<PB N="146" REF="86">
the King all these accidents that had happened.</P>
<P>Moreouer hee caused the Lordes of all his pro|uinces
to bee assembled together in a place appoin|ted
for that purpose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The K. com|mandeth all <HI>Idolles</HI> to be brought in, &amp; all other things that are contrary to Christian Re|ligion.</NOTE> and there publikely signified vn|to

bring them forth and deliuer them ouer to the <HI>Lieuete|nantes</HI>
of the Countrey: Otherwise whosoeuer did
not so, should be burned themselues without remissi|on

it is to bee noted, that within lesse then one moneth,
all the <HI>Idolles,</HI> and <HI>Witcheries</HI> and <HI>Characters,</HI> which they
worshipped and accounted for <HI>Gods,</HI> were sent and
brought vnto the Court. And certainely the number
of these toyes was infinite: for euery man adored and
reuerenced the thing that best liked him, without any
order, or measure, or reason at all, so that there was
among them a huge multitude of <HI>Deuilles,</HI> in sundrie
straunge and terrible shapes. Many there were, that
carryed a deuotion to <HI>Dragons</HI> with winges, which
they nourished and fed in their owne priuate houses,
giuing vnto them for their foode the best and most
costly viandes that they had. Others kept <HI>Serpents</HI>
of horrible figures: Some worshipped the greatest
<HI>Goates,</HI> they could get, some <HI>Tygres,</HI> and other most
monstrous Creatures, yea the more vncouth &amp; defor|med
the beastes were, the more they were honoured.
Some held in veneration certaine vncleane foules and
night-birdes, as <HI>Backes, Owles</HI> and <HI>Schritche-Owles,</HI> and
such like. To be briefe, they did choose for their Gods
diuers <HI>Snakes,</HI> and <HI>Adders,</HI> and <HI>Beastes,</HI> and <HI>Birdes,</HI> and

aswell painted in colours, as grauen in woode and
in stone, and in such other stuffe. Neyther did they
onely content themselues with worshipping the saide
creatures when they were quick and aliue, but also the
very skins of them when they were dead, being stuffed
with straw.</P>
<P>The acte of this their adoration was performed in
diuers sortes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their deuout worshipping of Idols.</NOTE> all wholly addressed and directed to ex|presse
their humilitie, as by kneeling on their knees, by
casting themselues groueling vpon the earth, by defi|ling

recouered his health, the <HI>Witches</HI> woulde perswade

that which was vsed among the <HI>Moci-Conghi</HI> concer|ning
their <HI>Religion,</HI> before they had receiued the <HI>Wa|ter</HI>

<P>Now the King hauing gathered together all these

<PB N="151" REF="88">
the <HI>Christian doctrine,</HI> which in deed following the ex|ample
of his father, he did maintain and vphold accor|dingly.</P>
<P>In his time, there began to sayle into these quarters
a great number of vessels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Isle of S. <HI>Thomas</HI> be|ginneth to be inhabited.</NOTE> and the <HI>Islande</HI> of <HI>S. Thomas</HI>
was inhabited with <HI>Portingalles,</HI> by the Kinges com|mandment.
For before those dayes it was all waste
and desert within lande, and inhabited onely vpon the
shore by a few saylers that came from the countries ad|ioyning.
But when this <HI>Islande</HI> in processe of time was
well peopled with <HI>Portingalles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The King of <HI>Portingall</HI> sen|deth one to be <HI>Bishop</HI> of the Isle of <HI>S. Tho|mas,</HI> and of <HI>Congo.</HI></NOTE> and other nations that

be of great trafficke, and was tilled and sowed, the king
sent thether a <HI>Bishoppe,</HI> to gouerne the <HI>Christians</HI> that
were in that <HI>Islande,</HI> and those also that were in <HI>Congo:</HI>
which the said <HI>Bishoppe</HI> did accomplish presently vpon
his arriuall, and afterwardes in <HI>Congo,</HI> where hee tooke
possession of his Pastorall charge. When he was come
into the kingdome of <HI>Congo,</HI> it was a thing incredible
to see,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The entertain|ment of the <HI>Bishop</HI> in <HI>Congo.</HI></NOTE> with howe great ioy hee was entertained by
the Kinge and all his people. For from the sea side
euen vnto the Cittie, being the space of a hundred and
fiftie miles, he caused the streetes to bee made smooth
and trimme, and to be couered all ouer with Mattes,
commanding the people, that for a certaine space seue|rally
appointed vnto them, they shoulde prepare the
wayes in such sort, that the <HI>Bishoppe</HI> shoulde not set his
foote vpon any part of the grounde which was not a|dorned.
But it was a farre greater wonder, to behold
all the countrey thereaboutes, and all the trees, and all
the places that were higher then the rest, swarming
with men and weomen that ran forth to see the <HI>Bishop,</HI>


<PB N="152" REF="89">
as a man that was holy and sent from God, offering vn|to
him, some of them lambes, some kiddes, some chic|kins,
some <HI>Partriches,</HI> some venison, and some fish, and
other kindes of victuailes in such aboundance, that hee
knew not what to do withall, but leaft it behind him;
whereby he might well know the great zeale and obe|dience
of these new <HI>Christians.</HI> And aboue all other
thinges it is to be noted for a memorable matter, that
the <HI>Bishoppe</HI> going on his way, there met him an innu|merable
multitude of men, &amp; weomen, and girles, and
boyes, and persons of fourescore yeares of age, and a|boue,
that crossed him in the streetes, and with singu|lar
tokens of true beliefe required the water of <HI>Holy
Baptisme</HI> at his hands: neyther would they suffer him
to passe vntill hee had giuen it them: so that to satisfie
their desires, hee was greatly stayed in his viage, and
was faine to carry water with him in certaine vesselles,
and salte, and other prouision necessary for that
action.</P>
<P>But I will leaue to report vnto you all the welcome
and entertainment, that was made vnto him in euery
place where he came, and the liuely ioy that generally
and particularly was shewed for the comming of this
<HI>Bishoppe.</HI> And now I will tell you, that hee arriued at
the Cittie of <HI>Saint Sauiours,</HI> where hee was met by the
<HI>Priestes,</HI> and by the king, and by all the Court, and so in
procession entred into the Church, &amp; after due thanks
giuen to God, hee was conducted to his lodging that
was assigned vnto him by the king.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Bishoppe</HI> foundeth the Cathedrall Church of <HI>S. Crosses.</HI></NOTE> And then present|ly

did so greatly esteeme cloth of gold and Arras, &amp; such

therof out of <HI>Portingall,</HI> so that at that time, Arras-hang|ings,
and cloth of gold, and of silke, and such like Lord|ly

he sent some of these <HI>Priests</HI> to prison into <HI>Portingal,</HI> and

accidentes to the King of <HI>Portingall,</HI> and to the <HI>Bishoppe</HI>

<PB N="174" REF="100">
whom he propounded the contents of his Commissi|ons.
But diuers great accidentes there happened, &amp;
many difficulties that crossed him, and altogether hin|dered
the course of those affaires, which hee had to ac|complish
in the name of the King of <HI>Congo.</HI> For first
hee hearde the dolorous newes of the Kinges death,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Aluaro</HI> King of <HI>Congo</HI> dieth</NOTE>
that sent him on this message: and then the <HI>King Don
Philip</HI> was wholly busied about the conquest of <HI>Eng|land,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>K. Philip</HI> busi|ed about the conquest of <HI>England.</HI></NOTE>
so that this busines went nothing forwardes, but
was delayed from time to time: neyther did he see any
meanes of dispatch, but rather hee was giuen to vnder|stand,
that for that time they could not intende to har|ken
vnto him.</P>
<P>Now the foresaide <HI>Odoardo,</HI> being afflicted with so
many aduersities,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Odoardo Lopez</HI> chaungeth his kind of pro|fession.</NOTE> began to call to mind the innumerable
perilles that he had passed, and the deadly infirmi|tie
wherewith he was plagued, after that long, &amp; hor|rible
nauigation. He saw that he was sometimes cast
downe, and sometimes exalted: and knew that in this
worlde there was none other rest or quiet, but in God
Almightie. He was greatly oppressed with hart griefe,
which he did dayly and continually endure, because
he could not relieue the necessities wherewith the peo|ple
of <HI>Congo</HI> were vexed and troubled, and manifestly
perceyued, that those poore soules incurred the ex|treame
daunger of falling into the vtter darkenesse of
hell. He considered the great expenses, that euery
day must be defrayed at the Court for the maintenance
of himselfe and his familie. Lastly, he was wholly de|priued
of all hope, that he should euer be able to bring
that matter to effect, which the king of <HI>Congo</HI> had im|posed
vpon him. And therefore he made choice of


<PB N="175" REF="100">
another course, that was not onely profitable for him,
but also most wholesome for his soule. For the good
Angell had touched his harte, and caused him with a
manly courage to abandon the <HI>Sword,</HI> and to take the
<HI>Crosse</HI> vpon him: and therevpon hee renounced the
worlde with all the deceitfull pompe and glorie
thereof; and in <HI>Madrill</HI> apparelled himselfe in a graye
course habite,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lopez</HI> goeth to <HI>Rome&punc;</HI> where he was kindly enter|tayned by the <HI>Pope.</HI></NOTE> and so went to <HI>Rome,</HI> to declare to <HI>Six|tus

<HI>Embassage,</HI> because he would not altogether neglect
the good intent and meaning of the King, that had sent
him, although he were now descended into a better
life. He was kindly welcomed and receiued by his
<HI>Holines,</HI> to whom hee discoursed the miserable estate,
wherein the Christian people of the Realme of <HI>Congo</HI>
did stand, for want of the worship and seruice of God,
and also the small number of Priestes, that were there
to instruct them in the doctrine of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and to de|liuer
vnto them the <HI>Sacraments</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> especial|ly
the multitude in that countrey being (as it were)
innumerable, that euery day resorted together, to bee
baptised, instructed, confessed and communicated.
Moreouer he made a vowe and resolued in his minde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The vow of <HI>Odoardo Lopez</HI> to erect a Se|minary, &amp; an Hospitall in <HI>Congo.</HI></NOTE>
that with such store of wealth, as God had blessed him
withall in <HI>Congo</HI> (which was not very small) he would
builde a house, wherein for the seruice of God, there
should dwell certaine learned men, and sundrie <HI>Priests,</HI>
to instruct the youth of those Countries in all good
languages, and in the arts liberal, and in the doctrine of
the <HI>Gospell,</HI> and in the misteries of our saluation. Out
of which house, as it were out of a holy Schoole, there
might come forth from time to time, many learned


<PB N="176" REF="101">
men and well studied in the law of God, that shoulde
be able in their owne naturall Countrey tongue, to a|waken
and raise againe the Faith of <HI>Christ,</HI> which was
now asleepe, and dried vp in those Regions: and there|by
in processe of time there woulde spring vp many
fruits of blessing, &amp; vigilant soules in the <HI>Christian Faith.</HI>
Herevnto he ment also to adde an <HI>Hospitall,</HI> that might
be a recourse and harbor for <HI>Gods</HI> poore, which com|ing
and sayling out of strange <HI>Countries</HI> should haue re|liefe
and entertainment in that <HI>Hostelry,</HI> and there be
cured and restored of their infirmities and necessities.
With this purpose therefore he went to <HI>Rome,</HI> to ob|teyne
of his holynes a licence to erect this <HI>Seminary</HI> and
<HI>Hospitall,</HI> and to beseech him also that he would graunt
him <HI>Iubilies, Indulgences,</HI> and other <HI>Dispensations,</HI> that for
such <HI>Christian</HI> and wholsom works are requisite, espe|cially
to the vse &amp; benefit of those <HI>Countries,</HI> which are
so remote from <HI>Christendome.</HI> He presented himselfe to

and then declared vnto him at large the tenor of his
Commissions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Pope</HI> re|mitteth the whole matter to the K. of <HI>Spaine.</HI></NOTE> wherein he had a gracious audience.

to discourse &amp; lay open the man|ners
and fashions of that Court, &amp;
other customes and conditions appertayning to that
Realme. In auncient time this King and his Courti|ers
were apparelled with certaine cloath made of the
<HI>Palme-Tree,</HI> (as we haue tolde you before) wherewith
they couered themselues from the girdlesteed downe|wardes,
and girded the same streyght vnto them with
certaine girdles made of the same stuffe, very faire and
well wrought. They vsed also to hang before them,
like an apron, certaine delicate and dainty skinnes, of


<PB N="178" REF="102">
little <HI>Tygres,</HI> of <HI>Ciuet-Cattes,</HI> of <HI>Sabelles,</HI> of <HI>Marternes,</HI>
and of such like creatures for an ornament: and for a
more glorious pompe and shew, they did weare vpon
their shoulders a certaine cape like a Whoode. Vpon
their bare skinne they had a certaine rounde garment
like a <HI>Rotchet,</HI> which they call <HI>Incutto,</HI> reaching downe
to their knees, made after the manner of a net, but the
stuffe of it was very fine cloth of the said <HI>Palme-Tree,</HI> &amp;
at the skirtes there hung a number of threede-tasselles,
that made a very gallant shew. These <HI>Rotchets</HI> were
turned vp againe, &amp; tucked vpon their right shoulder,
that they might be the more at libertie on that hande.
Vpon that shoulder also they had the taile of a <HI>Zebra,</HI>
fastned with a handle, which they vsed for a kinde of
brauery, according to the most auncient custome of
those partes. On their heades they wore cappes of
yellow and redde colour, square aboue and very little,
so that they scarcely couered the toppes of their heads,
and worne rather for a pompe and a vanitie, then to
keepe them eyther from the ayre or from the Sunne.
The most part of them went vnshodde: but the King
and some of the great <HI>Lords</HI> did weare certaine shooes
of the olde fashion, such as are to be seene in the anci|ent
<HI>Images</HI> of the <HI>Romanes,</HI> and these were made also of
the woode of the <HI>Palme-Tree.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The auncient apparell of the maaner sort.</NOTE> The poorer sorte and
the common people were apparelled from their
middle downewardes, after the same manner, but the
cloath was courser: and the rest of their bodie all na|ked.
The women vsed three kindes of trauerses, or (as
it were) aprons: beneath their girdlesteed. One was
very long and reached to their heels: the second short|er
then that, and the thirde shorter then both the o|ther,


<PB N="179" REF="102">
with fringes about them, and euery one of these
three was fastened about their middle, and open be|fore.
From their breastes downewardes, they had
another garment, like a kinde of dublet or iacket, that
reached but to their girdle: and ouer their shoulders a
certaine cloake. All these seuerall garmentes were
made of the same cloth of the <HI>Palme-Tree.</HI> They were
accustomed to goe with their faces vncouered, and a
little cappe on the head, like a mans cappe. The mea|ner
sorte of weomen were apparelled after the same
manner, but their cloth was courser: Their Maid-ser|uantes
and the basest kind of women were likewise at|tyred
from the girdle downeward, and all the rest of
the bodie naked.</P>
<P>But after that this kingdome had receyued the <HI>Chri|stian
Faith,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their new kind of appa|rell.</NOTE> the great <HI>Lords</HI> of the <HI>Court</HI> beganne to ap|parell
themselues after the manner of the <HI>Portingalles,</HI>

Iackets of <HI>Scarlet,</HI> and cloth of <HI>Silke,</HI> euery man accor|ding
to his wealth and abilitie. Vpon their heads they
had hats, or caps, and vpon their feet Moyls or Pantof|fles,
of <HI>Veluet</HI> and of <HI>Leather,</HI> and buskins after the <HI>Por|tingall</HI>
fashion, and long <HI>Rapiers</HI> by their sides. The
common people, that are not able to make their appa|rell
after that manner doe keepe their olde custome.
The women also go after the <HI>Portingall</HI> fashion, sauing
that they weare no cloakes, but vpon their heads they
haue certaine veyles, and vpon their veyles blacke vel|uet
cappes, garnished with iewelles, and chaines of
golde about their their neckes. But the poorer sorte
keep the old fashion: for onely the <HI>Ladies</HI> of the Court

ryot or enormitie committed against the <HI>Portingals</HI>

are iudged by the lawes of <HI>Portingall.</HI> And if any mis|chiefe
bee founde in any of them, the king confineth
the malefactor into some desert <HI>Island:</HI> for he thinketh
it to bee a greater punishmente to banish him in this

then at one blow to execute him. And if it so happen
that those which are thus chastized, doe liue tenne or
twelue yeares, the King vseth to pardon them, if they
be of any consideration at all, and doeth imploy them
in the seruice of the State, as persons that haue beene
tamed and well schooled, and accustomed to suffer
any hardenesse. In Ciuill disagreements there is an
order, that if a <HI>Portingall</HI> haue any suite against a <HI>Moci-Congo,</HI>

play vppon certaine Lutes that are made after a strange
fashion. For in the hollowe parte and in the necke
they are somwhat like vnto our <HI>Lutes,</HI> but for the
flat side, (where wee vse to carue a <HI>Rose,</HI> or a <HI>Rundell</HI>
to let the sounde goe inwarde) that is made not of
wood, but of a skinne, as thinne as a bladder, and the
stringes are made of hayres, which they draw out of
the <HI>Elephantes</HI> tayle, and are very strong and bright:
and of certaine threedes made of the woode of <HI>Palme-Tree,</HI>
which from the bottome of the instrument doe
reach and ascende to the toppe of the handle, and are
tyed euery one of them to his seuerall ringe. For to|wardes
the necke or handle of this <HI>Lute,</HI> there are cer|taine
rings placed some higher and some lower, where|at
there hange diuers plates of <HI>Iron</HI> and <HI>Siluer,</HI> which
are very thinne, and in bignesse different one from a|nother,
according to the proportion of the instru|ment.
These ringes doo make a sounde of sundrie
tunes, according to the striking of the stringes. For
the stringes when they are striken, doo cause the rings
to shake, and then doo the plates that hang at them,
helpe them to vtter a certayne mingled and confused
noyse. Those that play vppon this Instrument, doo
tune the strings in good proportion, and strike them
with their fingers, like a <HI>Harpe,</HI> but without any quill
very cunningly: so that they make thereby (I cannot


<PB N="183" REF="104">
tell whether I shoulde call it a melodie or no, but) such
a sounde as pleaseth and delighteth their sences well
enough. Besides all this (which is a thing very ad|mirable)
by this instrument they doo vtter they con|ceites
of their mindes, and doo vnderstande one ano|ther
so plainely, that euery thing almost which may
be explaned with the tongue, they can declare with
their hande in touching and striking this instrument.
To the sounde thereof they do dance in good measure
with their feet, and follow the iust time of that musicke
with clapping the palmes of their handes one against
the other. They haue also in the <HI>Court, Flutes</HI> and
<HI>Pipes,</HI> which they sound very artificially, and accor|ding
to the sounde they daunce and moue their feet,
as it were in a <HI>Moresco,</HI> with great grauity and sobrietie.
The common people doe vse little <HI>Rattles,</HI> and <HI>Pipes,</HI> &amp;
other instrumentes, that make a more harsh and rude
sound, then the Court-instruments do.</P>
<P>In this kingdome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Phisick.</NOTE> when any are sicke, they take

<HI>Stones,</HI> such as <HI>Mother Nature</HI> hath taught them. The
<HI>Ague</HI> is the most common disease that raigneth among
them: and plagueth them in Winter by reason of
the continuall raine, that bringeth heat and moysture
with it more then in Sommer, and besides that the sick|nes
which here we cal the <HI>French disease,</HI> &amp; <HI>Chitangas</HI> in
the <HI>Congo</HI> tongue, is not there so daungerous and so
harde to be cured, as it is in our Countries.</P>
<P>They heale the Ague with the poulder of a wood,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their medi|cine for an Ague.</NOTE>

and hauing annointed the bodie of the sicke person
two or three times withall from the head to the foote,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their medi|cine for the head-ache, &amp; other griefes of the body, is letting of blood.</NOTE>
the partie recouereth. When their head aketh, they
let bloude in the temples, with certaine little boxing

applying the <HI>Cornets</HI> therevnto, which with a sucke
of the mouth, will be filled with bloud: and this man|ner
of letting bloude is vsed also in <HI>Aegipt.</HI> And so in
any other parte of a mans body, where there is any
griefe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their medi|cine for the <HI>French pocks.</HI></NOTE> they drawe bloude in this fashion and heale it.

the same vnction of <HI>Saunders:</HI> whereof there are two
sorts, one redde (as we tolde you) and that is called
<HI>Tauila:</HI> the other gray, and is called <HI>Chicongo:</HI> and
this is best esteemed, for they will not sticke to giue or

they suddenly turne againe vpon them, and with great
courage and fiercenes make a cruell slaughter of them.
So that partely with their swiftnes, and partely with
their deceitful wiles and other cunning shifts of warre,
they are greatly feared in all those partes. They doo
inioy by the Kinges good fauour certayne Countries

ordinarily plague their enemies, by endeauouring
with all subtiltie to make them spende their shotte in
vaine vpon their Targettes: and when they see that
they haue made an ende of shooting, then doo they
renew the battell a fresh, and driuing them to flight,
make a cruell slaughter of them without all mercie.
And this is the manner which they vse against their e|nemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Amazones&punc;</HI></NOTE>
and the <HI>Amazones.</HI> But the <HI>Amazones</HI> on the
other side, which are very well acquainted herewith|all,
doo fight against them with other militarie strata|gems
(as we haue aboue declared) and doo ouercome
the forces of their aduersaries with their swiftnes and
great skill in matters of warre. For they doo assure
themselues, that if they be taken they shalbe deuoured:
and therefore with doubled courage they fight for
life, that they might ouercome, and in any case saue
their liues from that fierce and cruell nation. And
in this sorte doo they maintaine continuall warre, al|wayes
with great mortalitie on both sides. These <HI>Agags</HI>
dwell at the beginning of the Riuer <HI>Nilus,</HI> (where it

<P>Now it remayneth that we doo discourse of the ri|uer
<HI>Nilus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Riuer <HI>Nilus.</HI></NOTE> which doth not spring in the Countrye of
<HI>Bel-Gian,</HI> much lesse out of the mountains of the <HI>Moone,</HI>
nor (as <HI>Ptolomie</HI> writeth) out of the two <HI>Lakes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ptolemie</HI> dis|proued.</NOTE> which he
setteth down in <HI>Parallele,</HI> from the <HI>East</HI> to the <HI>West,</HI> with
a distaunce of about foure hundred and fiftie miles be|tweene
them. For in the altitude of the same <HI>Pole,</HI>
wherein the said Authour placeth those two <HI>Lakes,</HI> ly|eth
also the kingdome of <HI>Congo</HI> and of <HI>Angola</HI> towards
the <HI>West,</HI> and and on the other side <HI>Eastward</HI> is the Em|pire
of <HI>Monomotapa,</HI> and the Kingdome of <HI>Sofala,</HI> with


<PB N="212" REF="119">
a distaunce from sea to sea of twelue hundred miles.
Now within all this space, as <HI>Signor Odoardo</HI> affirmed
vnto me, there is but one onely <HI>Lake</HI> to bee founde,
which lyeth in the confines of <HI>Angola</HI> and <HI>Monomotapa,</HI>
and contayneth in <HI>Diameter</HI> an hundred ninetie and
fiue miles. Of the <HI>Westerne</HI> side of this <HI>Lake,</HI> the peo|ple
of <HI>Angola</HI> do giue sufficient information, and of
the other side <HI>Eastwarde,</HI> those of <HI>Sofala</HI> and <HI>Monomota|pa.</HI>
So that there is a ful and perfect knowledge of this
one <HI>Lake,</HI> but of any other thereabouts, there is no
mention at all made: And therefore it may well bee
concluded, that there are none other to be founde in
that altitude of degrees, True it is in deede, that there
are two <HI>Lakes,</HI> but they are situate in places quite con|trary
to that which <HI>Ptolemie</HI> writeth. For he (as it hath
beene told you) placeth his <HI>Paralleles</HI> from <HI>West</HI> to <HI>East:</HI>
but these are situate from the <HI>South</HI> to the <HI>North,</HI> as it
were in a direct line, with the distance of about foure
thousand miles betweene them. Some that dwell in
those countries do holde an opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nilus</HI> doth not hide him selfe vnder the ground, and then arise a|gaine, as some say.</NOTE> that <HI>Nilus</HI> after it
is issued out of the first <HI>Lake,</HI> hideth it selfe vnder the
grounde, and afterwardes riseth againe: but others
doo deny that it is so. <HI>Signor Odoardo</HI> did iustifie it to
me, that the true history and certainty of this matter,
is that <HI>Nilus</HI> doth not hide it selfe vnder the grounde,
but that it runneth through monstrous and desert val|leyes
without any setled channell, and where no
people inhabiteth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The true spring of <HI>Ni|lus</HI> is out of the first <HI>Lake&punc;</HI></NOTE> and so (they say) it sinketh into the
bottome of the earth.</P>
<P>From this first <HI>Lake</HI> in deed doth <HI>Nilus</HI> spring, which
lyeth in twelue degrees towardes the <HI>Pole Antarctike,</HI> &amp;
is compassed about like a vault, with exceeding high


<PB N="213" REF="119">
mountaines, the greatest whereof are called <HI>Cafates</HI> vp|on
the <HI>East,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The second <HI>Lake.</HI></NOTE> and the hilles of <HI>Sal-Nitrum,</HI> and the hilles
of <HI>Siluer</HI> on another side, and lastly with diuers other
Mountaines on the thirde part. This Riuer <HI>Nilus</HI> run|neth
for the space of 400. miles directly towardes
the <HI>North,</HI> and then entreth into another verye great
<HI>Lake</HI> which the inhabitantes doo call a <HI>Sea.</HI> It is much
bigger then the first, for it contayneth in breadth two
hundred and twentie miles, and lyeth vnder the line
<HI>Equinoctiall.</HI> Of this second <HI>Lake</HI> the <HI>Anzichi,</HI> who
are neere neighbours to <HI>Congo,</HI> doo giue very certaine
and perfect information, for they trafficke into those
partes.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The people that dwelleth about the second <HI>Lake.</HI></NOTE> And they report that in this <HI>Lake</HI> there is a peo|ple,

haue not in the partes of <HI>Congo;</HI> that they builde their
houses with stone and lime, and that for their fashions
and qualities they may bee compared with the <HI>Portin|galles.</HI>
Wherevpon it may bee well gathered, that
the Empire of <HI>Prete-Gianni</HI> cannot bee farre from
thence.</P>
<P>From this second <HI>Lake</HI> the riuer <HI>Nilus</HI> runneth for|wardes
to the <HI>Islande</HI> of <HI>Meroe,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Island of <HI>Meroe.</HI></NOTE> for the space of seauen

called, because it issueth out of a <HI>Lake</HI> of the same name,
and situate in the borders of <HI>Melinde.</HI> After that <HI>Nilus</HI>
is come to <HI>Meroe,</HI> it deuideth it selfe into two braun|ches,
and so compasseth about a good high Territory,
which is called <HI>Meroe&punc;</HI> Vpon the right hand whereof
towardes the <HI>East,</HI> there runneth a Riuer named <HI>Abag|ni,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> R. Abagni&punc;</NOTE>
that springeth out of the <HI>Lake Bracina,</HI> and crosseth

are diuers other Riuers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The R. <HI>Sara|boe.</HI></NOTE> among which <HI>Saraboe</HI> is one.
When <HI>Nilus</HI> hath thus receiued these riuers into it, &amp;
hath compassed the <HI>Islande</HI> with both his armes, hee
waxeth greater then he was before, and meeteth againe
in one channell, and by <HI>Aethiopia</HI> (which is called <HI>Ae|thiopia</HI>
aboue <HI>Aegypt)</HI> runneth to the <HI>Falles</HI> (as they call
them) which lie in a very lowe valley, that is very nar|rowe
and straite, and shutteth the riuer within a very
little channell,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Isle of <HI>Syene.</HI></NOTE> so that it falleth from aloft downewards
with a most horrible noyse, neere to the <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Syene.</HI>
And from thence watring all <HI>Aegypt,</HI> it disgorgeth his
streames into the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> sea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The two braunches of <HI>Nilus</HI> falling into the <HI>Me|diterranean sea.</HI></NOTE> (which lyeth di|rectly
ouer against the <HI>Islande</HI> of <HI>Cyprus)</HI> by two of his
principall braunches, the one called at this day, the

of <HI>Rossetto</HI> on the <HI>West.</HI></P>
<P>And forasmuch as wee are nowe come to the very
ende of this discourse concerning <HI>Nilus,</HI> it will be very
conuenient,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cause of the encrease of <HI>Nilus.</HI></NOTE> that wee touch in briefe the occasion of
his encrease. As we haue tolde you before, the prin|cipall
cause of the encrease of <HI>Nilus,</HI> is the great quan|tity
of waters, that raine from heauen at such time as
the spring beginneth here in these countries, but there
with them in winter, which may be (to speake gene|rally)
about the beginning of <HI>April.</HI> This water falleth
not, as the water falleth in these Regions of <HI>Europe,</HI> but
it falleth most aboundantly, and commeth downe not
in smal drops like our raine, but is powred down (as it
were with pailes and buckets.) So that because it falleth
with so great violence and in so great a quantity, the


<PB N="215" REF="120">
earth cannot sucke it vp, nor drink it in: for the ground
being ragged, and somewhat bending downward, the
water scowreth away with an exceeding furie, and
running into the riuers causeth them to swell and to
rise in a maruellous manner, and so ouerflowe the coun|trey:
You must herewithall consider especially, that
they haue these continuall raines for the space of fiue
whole Moones together, that is to say in <HI>Aprill, May,
Iune, Iuly,</HI> and <HI>August,</HI> but principally in <HI>May, Iune</HI> and
<HI>Iuly:</HI> for then are the waters in their greatest pride. And
herevpon it commeth to passe, that the Countrey be|ing
full of mountaines and very high hilles (as hath
beene told you) and consequently replenished with
diuers brookes, and rillets, and <HI>Lakes,</HI> they all ioyning
and meeting together in the channelles of the greater
Riuers, doo make them so great and so large, that they
containe and carry more water, then all the Riuers of
the vniuersall worlde: and the <HI>Lakes</HI> growe to such an
excessiue compasse and widenes, that it is a wonder:
as may be seene in the discourse touching the <HI>Cape</HI> of
<HI>Good-Hope,</HI> and all these kingdomes of <HI>Congo,</HI> and the
Countreyes there adioyning, where there are <HI>Lakes</HI> of
so extraordinarie a bignesse, that in the languages of
those Regions, they are not called <HI>Lakes,</HI> but <HI>Seas.</HI></P>
<P>And thus you see how the Riuer <HI>Nilus,</HI> in the times
and seasons before mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The seuerall courses of sundrie great Riuers.</NOTE> on the one side doeth
runne most furiously from those Countries, into the
<HI>North</HI> to water <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and the Riuer <HI>Zaire,</HI> and the Ri|uer
<HI>Nigir</HI> on the other side <HI>Westwarde</HI> and <HI>Eastwarde:</HI>
and towardes the <HI>South,</HI> other huge and monstrous Ri|uers,
which at certaine determined and limited times
doo neuer faile to encrease as <HI>Nilus</HI> doeth. And this


<PB N="216" REF="121">
is the effect of them, which is ordinarily seene euery
yeare, especially in <HI>Cairo,</HI> and ouer all <HI>Aegypt,</HI> where
<HI>Nilus</HI> beginneth to ryse about the ende of <HI>Iune,</HI> and
continueth his rising till the twentith of <HI>September,</HI> as I
haue seene my selfe. But the occasion and cause of this
encrease hath beene vntill this present time very secret
and obscure:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign">. 1. The Riuer that falleth from head. <HI>Hom. Odis.</HI> 4.</NOTE> and although the ancient writers, begin|ning
euen at <HI>Homere,</HI> haue after a sorte and in generall
tearmes leaft in writing, that <HI>Nilus</HI> doeth increase by
raine, yet haue they not so distinctly and plainely dis|coursed
thereof, as <HI>Signor Odoardo</HI> hath done, and te|stified
the same by his owne view and knowledge. For
some there were, that haue assigned the cause of this
ouerflowing, to bee the raine that commeth from the
Mountaines of the <HI>Moone:</HI> Others haue attributed it
to the snowes that are melted in those Mountaines, &amp;
yet <HI>Nilus</HI> doth not swell or ryse any thing neere to the
Mountaines of the <HI>Moone,</HI> but a great way from them
towards the <HI>North:</HI> and besides that the season of win|ter
doeth rather breed Snow, then yeeld any heate to
melt it.</P>
<P>And now that I haue with good diligence enqui|red
of <HI>Signor Odoardo</HI> these matters aboue written,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The conclusi|on of this booke.</NOTE> vp|on
such pointes as I had before plotted to my selfe, and
hee also propounding the rest vnto mee of his owne
meere motion, like a man of high conceite (as in truth
he is) and satisfying me with such aunsweres, as are set
downe in this discourse: yet I doo assure my selfe, that
euery man will not rest fully contented and satisfyed
herewith, especially such as are curious, and practised
in matters of the worlde, and skilfull in the Sciences.

are different from these in respect of their profession.

he sayled, presently after he had finished this trea|tise,

little which is contayned in these few leaues, is not ve|ry
little. But yet if perhaps there be any thing found
therein, that may be eyther profitable, or straunge, or
delightfull, or fit to passe away the time, and to driue
away Melancholie, let it bee wholly ascribed to the
