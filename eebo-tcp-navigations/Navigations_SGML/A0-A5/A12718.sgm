<P>(3) The ayre is good, and of an healthfull con&s;titution: the &s;oyle is fat, affording many com|modities,
and the Countrey mo&s;t plea&s;ant in her &s;ituation: for the In-land is watered with many

whereby Ve&s;&s;els of burden di&s;charge their rich Trea&s;ures, and her &s;elfe with open hand di&s;tributeth

Of this Citie, in the yeare of <HI>Chri&s;t Ie&s;us</HI> 141. as the Monke of <HI>Barton</HI> doth report, nine Scholars

<P>(2) This Counties Climate is mo&s;t healthfull and temperate, and Soyle &s;o fertile for Corne
and Cattle, that no place in <HI>England</HI> yeeldeth more or better conditioned: &s;weet Riuers running as

&s;uch are <HI>Lem&s;ter, Irchenfeild,</HI> the bankes of <HI>Wye, Luge,</HI> and <HI>Frome.</HI></P>
<P>(3) The ancient people knowne to the <HI>Romanes,</HI> (who&s;e power they well felt before they could
&s;ubdue them) were the <HI>Silures,</HI> placed by <HI>Ptolemie</HI> in this tract, and branched further into <HI>Radnor,
Brecknok, Monmouth,</HI> and <HI>Glamorgan-&s;hires,</HI> at this day by vs called <HI>South-Wales,</HI> and by the <HI>Wel&s;h De|beubarth.</HI>
Their Originall, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> coniectureth by their &s;ite, coloured countenances and curled
haire, was out of <HI>Spaine,</HI> and as both he and <HI>Plinie</HI> de&s;cribes them, were fierce, valiant, and impatient

the <HI>Roman</HI> a&s;&s;aulters, for who&s;e onely Conque&s;t (and that made by treachery) the Victor in <HI>Rome</HI>
triumphed with more then a v&s;uall A&s;pect; and with &s;o equall an hand bare the Scoale of Re&s;i&s;tance,
that their owne Writers euermore terme it a dangerous Warre. For the Legion of <HI>Marius Valens</HI>
<PB REF="75">

the&s;e <HI>Silures</HI> vnto the <HI>Romans,</HI> where continually &s;ome of their Legions afterward kept, till all was

<P>(4) The <HI>Saxons</HI> then made them&s;elues Lords of this Land, and this Prouince a part of their
<HI>Mercians</HI> Kingdome; yea, and <HI>Sutton</HI> the Court of great <HI>Offa</HI> their King.</P>
<P>(5) But <HI>Hereford</HI> after, rai&s;ed of the ruines of old <HI>Ariconium</HI> (now <HI>Kenche&s;ter,</HI> &s;haken in pieces
by a violent Earth quake) grew to great fame, through a conceiued &s;anctity by the buriall of <HI>Ethel|bert</HI>
King of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Angles,</HI> &s;laine at <HI>Sutton</HI> by <HI>Offa,</HI> at what time he came thither to haue e&s;pou&s;ed to
his Daughter; who&s;e graue was fir&s;t made at <HI>Marden,</HI> but afterwards canonized and remoued to
this Citie, when in honour of him was built the Cathedrall Church by <HI>Milfrid,</HI> a pettie King of
that Country, which <HI>Gruffith</HI> Prince of <HI>South-Wales,</HI> and <HI>Algar</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> rebelling again&s;t

time the Towne was walled, and is &s;o remaining in good repaire, hauing &s;ixe Gates for entrance,
and fifteen Watch-towers for defence, extending in compa&s;&s;e to fifteen hundred paces: and whence
the <HI>North-Pole</HI> is ob&s;erued to be rai&s;ed 52. degrees, 17. minutes in Latitude, and is &s;et from the fir&s;t

<P>The greate&s;t glory that this Citie receiued, was in King <HI>Athel&s;tans</HI> dayes; where (as <HI>Malmesbury</HI>

performed and continued I finde not.</P>
<P>(6) Things of rare note in this Shire are &s;aid to be, <HI>Bone well,</HI> a Spring not farre from <HI>Richards
Ca&s;tle,</HI> wherein are continually found little Fi&s;hes bones, but not a &s;inne &s;eene; and being wholly

<P>(3) The Ayre in this Shire is of a fauourable temperature, that giues an appetite for labour, diet,

abundance of Corne in euery place &s;pread, the Woods and Pa&s;turage in her hils and plaines, &s;weet
Riuers that water the vallies below, and Cattle that couer the tops of higher ground; the Fields,

with <HI>Watling-&s;treet-way</HI> is parted from <HI>Warwick-&s;hire;</HI> the re&s;t being bounded with the con|&s;ines
of <HI>Darby,</HI> is a Country Champion, abounding in corne, but &s;pary of woods, e&s;pecially in
the South and Ea&s;t parts, which are &s;upplyed with pit-coales plenteou&s;ly gotten in the North
of this Prouince, and with abundance of Cattle bred in the hilles beyond the Riuer <HI>Wreak,</HI> which is
nothing &s;o well inhabited as the re&s;t.</P>
<P>(2) The Ayre is gentle, milde, and temperate, and giueth appetite both to labour and re&s;t:
whole&s;ome it is, and draweth mans life to a long age, and that much without &s;ickne&s;&s;e; at <HI>Carleton</HI>
onely &s;ome defect of pronunciation appeareth in their &s;peech.</P>
<P>(3) The &s;oile thus con&s;i&s;ting, the commodities are rai&s;ed accordingly of Corne, Cattle, and
Coales; and in the Rockes neere <HI>Beuer</HI> are &s;ometimes found the <HI>A&s;troites,</HI> the Starre-like precious
Stone.</P>
<P>(4) The ancient people that inhabited this Countie, were the <HI>Coritani,</HI> who were &s;pread further
into other Shires, but after that the <HI>Romans</HI> had left the Land to it &s;elfe, this with many more fell
to be vnder the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and gouernment of the <HI>Mercians,</HI> and their Kings, from whom the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
enioyeth it at this day.</P>
<P>(5) In Circular-wi&s;e (almo&s;t) the compa&s;&s;e of this Shire is drawne indifferently &s;pacious, but
not very thicke of Inclo&s;ures, being from <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to We&s;t in the broade&s;t part not fully 30. miles, and
<PB REF="94">
from North to South but 24. the whole circumference about 196. miles; who&s;e principall Citie is
&s;et, as the Center, almo&s;t in the mid&s;t; from whom the Pole is eleuated 53. degrees and 4 minutes
in Latitude, and for Longitude, 19. degrees, 22. minutes.</P>
<P>(6) From this Towne the Shire hath the name, though the name of her &s;elfe is diuer&s;ly written,
as <HI>Legece&s;tria, Legora, Legeo-ce&s;ter:</HI> by <HI>Ninius, Caer-Lerion;</HI> by <HI>Mathew</HI> of <HI>We&s;tmini&s;ter</HI> (if we doe
not mi&s;take him) <HI>Wirall;</HI> and now la&s;tly, <HI>Leice&s;ter:</HI> ancient enough if King <HI>Leir</HI> was her builder,
eight hundred fortie and foure yeares before the birth of our Sauiour, wherein he placed a Flamine
to &s;erue in the Temple of <HI>Ianus,</HI> by him&s;elfe there erected, and where he was buried, if <HI>Ieffery ap Ar|thur</HI>
&s;ay true: but now certaine it is, that <HI>Ethelred</HI> the <HI>Mercian</HI> Monarch made it an Epi&s;copall See,
in the yeare of Chri&s;t Ie&s;us 680. wherein <HI>Sexwulph</HI> of his election became the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop: which
&s;hortly after was thence tran&s;lated, and therewith the beautie of the Towne began to decay; vpon
who&s;e de&s;olations that erectifying Lady <HI>Edel&s;ted</HI> ca&s;t her eyes of compa&s;&s;ion, and both reedified the
buildings, and compa&s;&s;ed it about with a &s;trong wall, where, in &s;hort time the Cities trade &s;o increa|&s;ed,
that <HI>Matthew Paris</HI> in his le&s;&s;er Story reporteth as followeth; <HI>Lege-ce&s;ter</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>is a right
wealthy Citie, and notably defended; and had the wall a &s;ure foundation, were inferiour to no Citie what|&s;oeuer.</HI>
But this pride of pro&s;peritie long la&s;ted not vnder the <HI>Normans,</HI> for it was &s;ore oppre&s;&s;ed with
a world of calamities, when <HI>Robert Bo&s;&s;u</HI> the Crouch-backe Earle of that <HI>Prouince,</HI> rebelled again&s;t
his Soueraigne Lord King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd: whereof heare the &s;ame Author <HI>Paris</HI> &s;peake: <HI>Through
the ob&s;tinate &s;tubborne&s;&s;e of Earle</HI> Robert (&s;aith he) <HI>the noble Citie</HI> Leice&s;ter <HI>was be&s;ieged and throwne
downe by King</HI> Henry, <HI>and the wall that &s;eemed indi&s;&s;oluble, was vtterly raced, euen to the ground.</HI>
The peeces of who&s;e fragments &s;o fallen downe, remained in his dayes like to hard rockes, through
the &s;trength of the Morter cementing whole lumpes together: and at the Kings command the Citie
was &s;et on fire and burnt, the Ca&s;tle raced, and a heauit impo&s;ition laid vpon the Citizens, who with
<PB REF="95">
great &s;ummes of money bought their owne Bani&s;hments: but were &s;o v&s;ed in their departure, that
for extreame feare many of them tooke Sanctuary, both at S. <HI>Edmunds</HI> and S. <HI>Albanes.</HI> In repen|tance
of the&s;e mi&s;chiefes, the Author thereof, <HI>Earle Robert,</HI> built the Mona&s;tery of S. <HI>Mary de Prae|tis,</HI>
wherein him&s;elfe became a Canon regular, and for fifteene yeares continuance in &s;ad laments
&s;erued God in continuall prayers. With the like deuotion, <HI>Henry</HI> the fir&s;t Duke of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> built
an Ho&s;pitall for an hundred and ten poore people, with a Collegiate Church, a Deane, twelue Ca|nons
Prebendaries, as many Vicars, &s;ufficiently prouided for with reuenewes; wherein him&s;elfe
lyeth buryed: and it was the greate&s;t ornament of that Citie, vntil the hand of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 8.
lay ouer-heaiue vpon all the like foundations, and laid their a&s;pired tops at his owne feete.</P>
<P>The fortunes of another <HI>Crouch-backe</HI> (King <HI>Richard</HI> the V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">per) were no le&s;&s;e remarkable in

leauing the &s;tench of Tyranny to all following ages; who from this Citie &s;etting forth in one day

<P>(7) Otherplaces worthy of remembrance in this Shire were the&s;e: In the We&s;t, where a high
Cro&s;&s;e was erected, in former times &s;tood the faire Citie <HI>Cleyce&s;ter,</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> BENONNES,

by <HI>Cuthwolfe</HI> their King, about the yeare of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> 572.</P>
<P>At <HI>Redmore,</HI> neere <HI>Bo&s;worth,</HI> We&s;tward in this Countie, the Kingdome of <HI>England</HI> lay in hazard
of one Battle, when King <HI>Richards</HI> Field was fought, where the Land at once was freed from a Ty|rant

<HI>Iohn Wickliffe, Englands</HI> Morning-&s;tarre, di&s;per&s;ed the clouds of all Papi&s;ticall darkne&s;&s;e, by
preaching the Go&s;pell in that his charge; and &s;tile of his pen, &s;o piercing in power, that the man of
Sinne euer &s;ince hath beene better knowne to the world.</P>
<P>(8) Religious hou&s;es by Princes erected, and by them deuoted to God and his &s;eruice, the chie|fe&s;t
in this Shire were at <HI>Leice&s;ter, Grace-Dieu, Kerby Bellers,</HI> and at <HI>Burton</HI> a Spittle for <HI>Lazers,</HI> a di&s;|ea&s;e

the Land of the <HI>Saxons,</HI> vntill of latter times theirs began to decay, and the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> to increa&s;e, who
<PB REF="106">

tho&s;e ancient Inhabitants mentioned by <HI>Ptolemie.</HI> The <HI>Ordouices</HI> vnder <HI>Caractachus</HI> purcha&s;ed great
honour, while&s;t he a Prince of the <HI>Silures</HI> remoued his warres thence among them, where a while
he maintained the <HI>Britaines</HI> libertie with valour and courage, in de&s;pight of the <HI>Romans.</HI> His Fort is
yet witne&s;&s;e of his vnfortunate fight, &s;eated neere <HI>Clune Ca&s;tle,</HI> at the confluence of that Riuer with
<HI>Temd,</HI> where (in remembrance of him) the place is yet called <HI>Caer-Caradoc,</HI> a Fort of his, wonne by
<HI>P. O&s;torius</HI> Lieutenant of the <HI>Romans,</HI> about the yeare of grace 53. The <HI>Cornauji</HI> were feared vpon
the North of <HI>Scuerne,</HI> and branched into other Counties, of whom we haue &s;aid.</P>
<P>(6) But when the &s;trength of the <HI>Romans</HI> was too weake to &s;upport their owne Empire, and <HI>Bri|taine</HI>
emptied of her Souldiers to re&s;i&s;t, the <HI>Saxons</HI> &s;et foot in this mo&s;t faire &s;oile, and made it a part
of their <HI>Mercian Kingdome:</HI> their line likewi&s;e i&s;&s;ued to the la&s;t period, and the <HI>Normans</HI> beginning
where the&s;e <HI>Saxons</HI> left, the <HI>Wel&s;hmen</HI> tooke aduantage of all pre&s;ent occa&s;ions, and brake ouer <HI>Se|uerne</HI>
vnto the Riuer <HI>Dee;</HI> to recouer which, the <HI>Normans</HI> fir&s;t Kings often affayed, and <HI>Henry</HI> the

and therewith was &s;hot thorow vnto death. In the like danger &s;tood <HI>Henry</HI> Prince of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who
in the &s;trait &s;iege of <HI>Ludlow,</HI> begirt by King <HI>Stephen,</HI> had beene plucked from his &s;addle with an iron
hooke from the wall, had not <HI>Stephen</HI> pre&s;ently re&s;cued him, <HI>Anno</HI> 1139.</P>
<P>(7) This then being the <HI>Marches</HI> of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> was &s;ore afflicted by bloudy broiles,
which cau&s;ed many of their Townes to be &s;trongly walled, and thirtie two Ca&s;tles to be &s;trongly

<HI>Arthur,</HI> to be re&s;ident at <HI>Ludlow,</HI> where that faire Ca&s;tle became a mo&s;t famous Princes Court.
And here King <HI>Henry</HI> the eight ordained the Coun&s;ell of the <HI>Marches,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of a Lord Pre&s;i|dent,

<P>(8) But the Shire-Towne <HI>Shrewesburie,</HI> for circuit, trade, and wealth, doth farre exceed this,
and is inferiour to few of our Cities; her buildings faire, her &s;treets many and large, her Citizens
rich, her trade for the mo&s;t part in the &s;taple commodities of Cloth and Free&s;es; her wals &s;trong,

<P>(2) The forme of this Countie doth much re&s;emble the right wing of an <HI>Eagle,</HI> &s;preading

two miles.</P>
<P>(3) If the affection to my naturall producer blind not the judgement of this my &s;uruey, for aire
and &s;oile it equale the be&s;t, and farre exceeds her neighbours the next Counties: for although the
Climate be cold, and toucheth the degree of Latitude 54. yet the warmth from the <HI>Iri&s;h Seas</HI> mel|teth
the Snow, and di&s;&s;olueth the Ice &s;ooner there then in tho&s;e parts that are further off; and &s;o
whole&s;ome for life, that the Inhabitants generally attaine to many yeares.</P>
<P>(4) The Soile is fat, fruitfull, and rich, yeelding abundantly both profit and plea&s;ures for man.
The Champion grounds make glad the hearts of their Tillers: the Meadowes imbrodered with
diuers &s;weet &s;melling flowers; and the Pa&s;ture makes the Kines vdders to &s;trout to the paile, from
whom and wherein the be&s;t <HI>Chee&s;e</HI> of all <HI>Europe</HI> is made.</P>

<P>And let me adde thus much, which <HI>Lucian</HI> could not; namely, that this Shire hath neuer beene

<P>The Shire may well be &s;aid to be a <HI>Seed-plot of Gentilitie,</HI> and the producer of many mo&s;t ancient

and the Women for grace, feature, and beautie, inferiour vnto none.</P>
<P>(6) The Commodities of this Prouince (by the report of <HI>Ranulphus</HI> the Monke of <HI>Che&s;ter)</HI> are
chiefly <HI>Corne, Cattle, Fi&s;h, Fowle, Salt, Mines, Metals, Meares,</HI> and <HI>Riuers,</HI> whereof the bankes of <HI>Dee</HI>

<P>This Citie was made a County incorporate of it &s;elfe by King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eauenth, and is yeare|ly

<P>(5) This Counties ancient Inhabitants were the <HI>Brigantes,</HI> of whom there is more mention in

by many in&s;criptions found in walles and ancient monuments fixed in &s;tones, as by certaine Altars
erected in fauour of their Emperours. After the <HI>Romans,</HI> the <HI>Saxons</HI> brought it vnder their protecti|on,

<P>(6) Places of antiquitie or memorable note are the&s;e: the Towne of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> (&s;o famous, as

<HI>Mancunium</HI> by <HI>Antonine</HI> the Emperour, and was made a Fort and Station of the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ribleche&s;ter</HI> (which taketh the name from <HI>Rhibell,</HI> a little Riuer neere <HI>Clithero)</HI> though it be a &s;mall

<P>But the Shire-Towne is <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> more plea&s;ant in &s;ituation, then rich of Inhabitants, built on

<P>(7) This Country in diuers places &s;uffereth the force of many flowing Tides of the Sea, by

the force of Inua&s;ions, &s;o is it &s;trengthned on the other by many Ca&s;tles and fortified places, that

CHAPTER XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>AS the cour&s;es and confluents of great Riuers are for the mo&s;t part fre&s;h in memory, though
their heads and fountaines lie commonly vnknowne: &s;o the latter knowledge of great Re|gions,
are not traduced to obliuion, though perhaps their fir&s;t originals be ob&s;cure, by rea|&s;on
of Antiquitie, and the many reuolutions of times and ages&punc; In the delineation there|fore
of this great Prouince of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> I will not in&s;i&s;t vpon the narration of matters neere
vnto vs; but &s;uccinctly run ouer &s;uch as are more remote; yet neither &s;o &s;paringly, as I may &s;eeme
to dimini&s;h from the dignitie of &s;o worthy a Country; nor &s;o prodigally, as to &s;pend time in the
&s;uperfluous prai&s;ing of that which neuer any (as yet) di&s;prai&s;ed. And although perhaps it may &s;eeme
a labour vnnece&s;&s;ary, to make relation of ancient remembrances, either of the Name or Nature of
this Nation, e&s;pecially looking into the difference of Time it &s;elfe (which in euery age bringeth
forth diuer&s;e effects) and the di&s;po&s;itions of men, that for the mo&s;t part take le&s;&s;e plea&s;ure in them,
then in divulging the occurrents of their owne times: yet I hold it not vnfit to begin there, from
whence the fir&s;t certaine direction is giuen to proceede; for (euen of the&s;e ancient things) there may
be good v&s;e made, eitherby imitation, or way of compari&s;on, as neither the repetition, nor the re|petition
thereof &s;hall be accounted impertinent.</P>
<P>(2) You &s;hall therefore vnder&s;tand: That the Countie of <HI>Yorke</HI> was in the <HI>Saxon</HI> tongue called
<HI>Ebona-yeyne,</HI> and now commonly <HI>Yorke&s;hire,</HI> farre greater and more numerous in the Circuit of her
miles, then any Shire of <HI>England.</HI> Shee is much bound to the &s;ingular loue and motherly ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters"> of Na|ture,
in placing her vnder &s;o temperate a clime, that in euery mea&s;ure &s;he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">.
<PB REF="115">
If one part of her be &s;tony, and a &s;andy barren ground: another is fertile and richly adorned with
Corne-fields. If you here finde it naked, and de&s;titute of Woods, you &s;hall &s;ee it there &s;hadowed
with Forre&s;ts full of trees, that haue very thicke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;ending forth many fruitfull and profitable
branches. If one place of it be Moori&s;h, Mirie, and vnplea&s;ant; another makes a free tender of de|light,
and pre&s;ents it &s;elfe to the eye, full of beautie and contentiue varietie.</P>
<P>(3) The Bi&s;hopricke of <HI>Durham</HI> fronts her on the North-&s;ide, and is &s;eperated by a continued
cour&s;e of the Riuer <HI>Tees</HI> The <HI>Germaine Sea</HI> lieth &s;ore vpon her Ba&s;t &s;ide, beating the &s;hores with her
boi&s;terous waues and billowes. The We&s;t part is bounded with <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmerland.</HI> The
South-&s;ide hath <HI>Che&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Darbi&s;hire</HI> (friendly Neighbours vnto her) with the which &s;he is fir&s;t
inclo&s;ed: then with <HI>Nottingham</HI> and with <HI>Lincolne-&s;hires:</HI> after diuided with that famous Arme of the
Sea <HI>Humber:</HI> Into which all the Riuers that water this Country, emptie them&s;elues, and pay their
ordinary Tributes, as into the common receptacle and &s;tore-hou&s;e of <HI>Neptune,</HI> for all the watery Pen|&s;ions
of this Prouince.</P>
<P>(4) This whole Shire (being of it &s;elfe &s;o &s;patious) for the more ea&s;ie and better ordering of her
ciuill gouernment, is diuided into three parts: which according to three quarters of the world, are
called <HI>The We&s;t-Riding, The Ea&s;t-Riding,</HI> and <HI>The North-Riding. We&s;t-Riding</HI> is for a good &s;pace com|pa&s;&s;ed
with the Riuer <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> with the bounds of <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and with the South limits of the Shire, and
beareth towards the We&s;t and South. <HI>Ea&s;t-Riding</HI> bends it &s;elfe to the Ocean, with the which, and
with the Riuer <HI>Derment</HI> &s;he is inclo&s;ed, and lookes into that part where the Sunne ri&s;ing, and &s;hew|ing
forth his beames, makes the world both glad and glorious in his brightne&s;&s;e <HI>North-Riding</HI> ex|tends

Riuer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">, is foure&s;core miles; the whole Circumference is three hundred and eight miles.</P>
<P>(5) The Soile of this County for the generalitie is rea&s;onable fertile, and yeelds &s;ufficiency of
Corne and Cattle within it &s;elfe. One part whereof is particularly made famous by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> of

<P>(6) That the <HI>Romans</HI> flouri&s;hing in military prowe&s;&s;e, made their &s;euerall &s;tations in this Coun|try,
is made manife&s;t by their Monuments, by many In&s;criptions fa&s;tned in the Walles of Churches,
by many Columnes engrauen with <HI>Roman</HI> work<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> found lying in Church-yards, by many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> Al|tars

making of Brickes, which hauing &s;ithence bin found, and from time to time digd out of the ground,
proue the Antiquitie of the place by the <HI>Romane</HI> In&s;criptions vpon them.</P>
<P>(7) No le&s;&s;e argument of the pietie hereof, are the many Mona&s;teries, Abbyes and Religious
hou&s;es that haue beene placed in this Country; which while&s;t they retained their owne &s;tate and
magnificence, were great ornaments vnto it: but &s;ince their di&s;&s;olution, and that the teeth of Time
(which deuours all things) haue eaten into them, they are become like dead carka&s;&s;es, leauing one|ly
&s;ome poore ruines and remaines aliue, as reliques to po&s;teritie, to &s;hew of what beautie and mag|nitude
they haue beene. Such was the Abbey of <HI>Whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">y,</HI> founded by Lady <HI>Hilda,</HI> daughter of the

grand-childe vnto King <HI>Edwine.</HI> Such was the Abbey built by <HI>Bolcon,</HI> which is now &s;o razed and laid
Ieuell with the earth, as that at this time it affords no appearance of the former dignitie. Such was
<HI>Kirk&s;tall</HI> Abbey, of no &s;mall account in time pa&s;t, founded in the yeare of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> 1147. Such was the
renowned Abbey called S. <HI>Maries</HI> in <HI>Yorke,</HI> built and endowed with rich liuings by <HI>Alan</HI> the third
Earle of little <HI>Britaine</HI> in <HI>America;</HI> but &s;ince conuerted into the Princes hou&s;e, and is called <HI>The

that contagious <HI>Pelagian</HI> Here&s;ie, which oftentimes grew to Serpentine head in <HI>Britaine.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e places for Religion erected, with many more within this Prouinciall Circuit, and con&s;e|crated
vnto holy purpo&s;es, &s;hew the antiquitie, and how they haue beene &s;ought vnto by confluences
of Pilgrimes in their manner of deuotions: The mid&s;t of which &s;uper&s;titious ob&s;curities, are &s;ince
cleared by the pure light of the Go&s;pell reuealed, and the skirts of Idolatry vnfolded to her owne
&s;hame and ignominie: And they made &s;ubiect to the di&s;&s;olution of Times, &s;eruing onely as antique
Monuments and remembrances to the memory of &s;ucceeding Ages.</P>
<P>(8) Many places of this Prouince are famou&s;ed as well by Name, being naturally fortunate in
their &s;ituation, as for &s;ome other accidentall happine&s;&s;e befallen vnto them. <HI>Hallifax,</HI> famous, as
well for that <HI>Iohannes defacro Be&s;co,</HI> Author of the Sphere, was borne there, and for the Law it hath
again&s;t &s;tealing, and for the greatne&s;&s;e of the Pari&s;h, which reckoneth in it eleuen Chappels, where|of
two be Pari&s;h-Chappels, and in them to the number of twelue thou&s;and people.</P>
<P>In former times it was called <HI>Horton,</HI> and touching the alteration of the name, this prety &s;tory is
<PB REF="116">
related of it: namely, That a Clerke (for &s;o they call him) being farre in loue with a maid, and by
no meanes either of long pray&s;es or large promi&s;es, able to gaine like affection at her hands, when he
&s;aw his hopes fru&s;trate, and that he was not like to haue his purpo&s;e of her, turned his loue into rage,
and cut off the maides head, which being afterwards hung vpon an Ewe tree, common people coun|ted
it as an hallowed relique till it was rotten: And afterwards (&s;uch was the credulitie of that time)
it maintained the opinion of reuerence and Religion &s;till: for the people re&s;orted thither on pilgri|mage,
and per&s;waded them&s;elues, that the little veynes that &s;pread out betweene the Barke and Bo|dy
of the Ewe tree like fine threds, were the very haires of the maids head. Hereupon it was called
by this name <HI>Haligfax,</HI> or <HI>Haly-fax,</HI> that is, <HI>Holy-Hayre.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pomfret</HI> is famous for the Site, as being &s;eated in a place &s;o plea&s;ant, that it brings forth <HI>Liquori<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI>
and great plentie of <HI>Skiriworts,</HI> but it is infamous for the murther and bloud&s;hed of Princes: The

<P>(9) But I will forbeare to be prolixe or tedious in the particular memoration of places in a Pro|uince
&s;o &s;patious, and onely make a compendious relation of <HI>Yorke,</HI> the &s;econd Citie of <HI>England,</HI> in

then from the Riuer <HI>Ou&s;e</HI> running thorow it: It ouer-ma&s;ters all the other places of this Country
for fairene&s;&s;e, and is a &s;ingular ornament &amp; &s;afegard to all the North parts. A plea&s;ant place, large,
and full of magnificence, rich, populous, and not onely &s;trengthened with fortifications, but ador|ned
with beautifull buildings, as well priuate as publike. For the greater dignitie thereof it was made
an Epi&s;copall See by <HI>Con&s;tantius,</HI> and a Metropolitane Citie by a <HI>Pall</HI> &s;ent vnto it from <HI>Homorius.
<PB REF="117">
Egbert</HI> Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Yorke,</HI> who flouri&s;hed about the yeare &s;eauen hundred fortie, erected in it a

the eight appointed a Coun&s;ell in the &s;ame, to decide and determine all the cau&s;es and Controuer|&s;ies
of the North parts, according to equitie and con&s;cience: which Coun&s;ell con&s;i&s;teth of a Lord
Pre&s;ident, certaine Coun&s;ellers at the Princes plea&s;ure, a Secretarie, and other Vnder-Officers.</P>
<P>The originall of this Citie cannot be fetcht out but from the <HI>romanes,</HI> &s;eeing the <HI>Britaines</HI> before
the <HI>Romanes</HI> came, had no other Townes then Woods fenced with Trenches and Rampiers, as <HI>Cae|&s;ar</HI>

<P>(2) The forme thereof is Triangle, and differs not much in the &s;idings; for from her South-Ea&s;t
vnto the South-We&s;t-point are neere vnto 40. miles; from thence to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> North-point are &s;ixty
miles, and her ba&s;e along the Sea-&s;hoare 45. miles: The whole in circum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters"> is about one hun|dred
fortie fiue miles.</P>
<P>(3) The Ayre mu&s;t needs be &s;ubtile and piercing, for that the Northernly parts are mo&s;t expo|&s;ed
to extremitie of weathers, as great winds, hard fro&s;ts, and long lying of &s;nowes, &amp;c. Yet would
it be farre more &s;harper then it is, were not the <HI>Germane Seas</HI> a ready meanes to further the di&s;&s;olu|tion
of her Ice and Snow, and the plentie of Coales there gotten, a great helpe to comfort the bo|dy
with warmth, and defend the bitter coldne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>(4) The Soile cannot be rich, hauing neither fertilitie of ground for Corne or Cattle, the mo&s;t
part of it being rough, and in euery place hard to be manured, &s;aue onely towards the Sea and the Ri|uer
<HI>Tyne,</HI> where, by the great diligence and indu&s;trious paines of good husbandry, that part is become
very fruitfull.</P>
<P>(5) The ancient Inhabitants of this Country, mentioned by <HI>Ptolemie,</HI> were called OTTALI|NI,

the Inhabitants, and the Po&s;ition and Site of the Prouince.</P>
<P>(6) The chiefe&s;t commoditie that enricheth this Countie, are tho&s;e Stones <HI>Linthancraces,</HI> which
we call Sea-coales, whereof there is &s;uch plentie and abundance digged vp, as they doe not onely
returne a great gaine to the Inhabitants, but procure al&s;o much plea&s;ure and profit to others.</P>
<P>(7) No place of this Prouince vents forth &s;o many of the&s;e Sea-coales into other regions as
<HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> doth, being the very eye of all the Townes in this County: for it doth not onely mini|&s;ter
reliefe (by &s;uch proui&s;ion) to all other parts of <HI>England,</HI> but doth al&s;o farni&s;h the wants of for|raine
Countries with her plentie. By meanes of this and the intercour&s;e of traffique which it hath,
the place is growne ex<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter">eeding rich and populous. Before the <HI>Conquest</HI> it was called <HI>Monk-che&s;ter:</HI>
hauing beene (<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 span">) in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Monkes:</HI> and <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> being added, which &s;ignifies
a bulwarke or place of defence, &s;hewes that in ancient time it had beene a place of Fortification.</P>
<P>(8) After the <HI>Conque&s;t</HI> it got the name of <HI>Newca&s;tle&punc;</HI> by the new Ca&s;tle which <HI>Robert</HI> the Sonne
of <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Conquerour</HI> built there, out of the ground. What it was called in old time is not

But &s;ince it was reduced vnder the command of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, our Kings haue from time

termed <HI>Fons Sacer,</HI> in Engli&s;h, <HI>Holy-Well,</HI> and is al&s;o commonly called S. <HI>Winefrids Well;</HI> of whom an|tiquitie
thus reporteth: That <HI>Winefrid</HI> a Chri&s;tian Virgin, very faire and vertuous, was doated vpon
by a young lu&s;tfull Prince or Lord of the Country, who not long able to rule his head-&s;trong af|fections,
hauing many times in vaine attempted and tryed her cha&s;titie both by rich gifts and large
promi&s;es, could not by any meanes obtaine his de&s;ires; he therefore (in a place of aduantage) &s;ud|denly
&s;urprized and raui&s;hed her weake (yet re&s;i&s;ting) body. After the deed done, the cruell Ty|rant,
to &s;top her cries and acclamations, &s;lew her, and cut off her head: out of which place did &s;ud|denly
ari&s;e a Spring that continueth to this day, carrying from the Fountaine &s;uch a forcible &s;treame
and current, as the like is not found in Chri&s;tendome. Ouer the head of the Spring there is built a
Chappell of free &s;tone, with Pillars curiou&s;ly wrought and engraued, in the Chancell whereof, and
<PB REF="164">
gla&s;&s;e window, the picture of the Virgin is drawne, together with the memoriall of her life and death.
To this Fountaine Pilgrims are accu&s;tomed to repaire in their zealous, but blind deuotion; and
diuers others re&s;ort to bathe in, holding firmely that the water is of much vertue.</P>
<P>There be many red &s;tones in the bottome of this Well, and much greene mo&s;&s;e growing vpon
the &s;ides: the &s;uper&s;tition of the people holding that tho&s;e red &s;pots in the &s;tones were drops of the
Ladies bloud, which all the water in the Spring can neuer wa&s;h away; and that the mo&s;&s;e about the
wall was her haire, which though &s;ome of it be giuen to euery &s;tranger that comes, yet it neuer wa|&s;teth.

<P>There is al&s;o hard by <HI>Kilken</HI> (a &s;mall village) within this Countie, a little Well of no great note,

<HEAD>ANGLESEY.
CHAPTER XIII.</HEAD>
<P>ANGLESEY was in the time of the <HI>Romans</HI> called <HI>Mona,</HI> by the <HI>Britaines Mon,</HI> and <HI>Tir-Mon,</HI>
(that is) the Land of <HI>Mon,</HI> of the ancient <HI>Engli&s;h-Saxons Moneg:</HI> And at la&s;t, after the <HI>Eng|li&s;hmen</HI>
had by their &s;harpe and &s;euerall a&s;&s;aults brought it vnder their rules, and became
Lords thereof, it was termed <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> as one would &s;ay, <HI>The Engli&s;hmens Iland.</HI></P>
<P>(2) For, an <HI>Iland</HI> it is, albeit it be &s;euered from the Continent of <HI>Britaine,</HI> but with a &s;mall
and narrow &s;treight of the riuer <HI>Menai,</HI> and on all other parts beaten vpon with the &s;urging and trou|blous
<HI>Iri&s;h Sea,</HI> in which it lyeth &s;omewhat &s;quare-wi&s;e, not much different in length and breadth;
being, where it reacheth out in length, from <HI>Beau-mari&s;h</HI> Ea&s;tward, to the vtmo&s;t Promontory
We&s;t-ward, which we call <HI>Holy-head,</HI> twentie miles; and in breadth from <HI>Llanbaderik</HI> North-ward,
to the point of <HI>Menai</HI> South-ward, &s;eauenteene miles; the whole circuit or circumference amounting
towards &s;eauentie miles.</P>
<P>(3) The aire is rea&s;onable gratefull and healthfull, and not generally &s;ubiect to di&s;ea&s;es, excep|ting
certaine Agues at &s;ome times, which are occa&s;ioned by the &s;ogs and mi&s;ty exhalations, which
ari&s;e from the Sea called <HI>Mare Virginium,</HI> with the which this Ile is encompa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>(4) The Commodities that commend (or rather beautifie) this Country, are in Corne and
Cattle, wherewith it not onely enricheth it &s;elfe exceedingly, but &s;endeth out great proui&s;ion there|of
to others to &s;upply their defects, and although the ground may &s;eeme dry and &s;tony, or vnplea|&s;ant
and nothing &s;ightly, wherein for the outward qualitie it re&s;embleth &s;ome other parts of <HI>Wales,</HI>

<HEAD>SCOTLANDS GENERALL DESCRIPTION.
CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>SCOTLAND, the &s;econd Kingdome of <HI>Great Britaine,</HI> and the North part of the Iland,
hath on the Ea&s;t the <HI>Germane Ocean,</HI> on the North, the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> and <HI>Deucalidon Sea,</HI> the We&s;t
affronted with <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the South hath the Riuer <HI>Tweed,</HI> the <HI>Cheuiot Hils,</HI> and the adiacent
Tract, reaching to the <HI>Sulway</HI> Sands, whereby it is &s;eparated from <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>(2) This Kingdome is faire and &s;pacious, and from the&s;e South-borders &s;preadeth it &s;elfe
wide into the Ea&s;t and We&s;t, till againe it contracts it &s;elfe narrower vnto the Northerne Promon|tories:
furni&s;hed with all things befitting a famous Kingdome; both for Ayre and Soyle, Riuers,
Woods, Mountaines, Fi&s;h, Fowle, and Cattle, and Corne &s;o plenteous, that it &s;upplyeth therewith
other Countryes in their want. The people thereof are of good feature, &s;trong of body, and of cou|ragious
minde, and in warres &s;o venturous, that &s;carce any &s;eruice of note hath beene performed,
but that they were with the fir&s;t and la&s;t in the field. Their Nobilitie and Gentry are very &s;tudious
of learning, and all ciuill knowledge; for which end they not onely frequent the three Vniuer&s;ities
of their owne Kingdome (S. <HI>Andrewes, Gla&s;co,</HI> and <HI>Edenbrough,</HI> the Nur&s;eries of Pietie, and Man|&s;ions
of the &s;acred <HI>Mu&s;es)</HI> but al&s;o much addict them&s;elues to trauell into forraine Countries.</P>
<P>(3) The Counties contained in this Kingdome are many, and euery where be&s;trewed with Ci|ties,
Towne, and Borrowes, as is that of <HI>England:</HI> and, as <HI>England,</HI> I entended to de&s;cribe it, had I
not beene happily preuented by a learned Gentleman of that Nation, who hath mo&s;t exactly be|gun,

and gone through the greate&s;t difficulties thereof; to build vpon who&s;e foundations, I hold it
iniurious: and am &s;o farre from any ambition to preuent his noble purpo&s;es, that I heartily with all
happie furtherances thereto, with a longing de&s;ire to &s;ee, by his indu&s;trious labours, another <HI>Scene</HI>
added to the perfecting of the <HI>Theatre of Britaines glory.</HI></P>
<P>(4) Yet, in the meane while, le&s;t I &s;hould &s;eeme too difectiue in my intendments, let me with|out
offence (in this third, though &s;hort Booke) giue onely a generall view of that Kingdome, vpon
ob&s;eruations from others; which to accompli&s;h by mine owne &s;uruey (if others &s;hould hap to faile,
and my crazy-aged-body will giue leaue) is my chiefe de&s;ire; knowing the Iland furni&s;hed with
many worthy remembrances, appertaining both vnto them and vs, whom God now hath &s;et vnder
one Crowne: and the rather, for that their more Southerne people are from the &s;ame Originall
with vs the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> being both alike the <HI>Saxon</HI> branches: as al&s;o, that the <HI>Picts</HI> anciently inhabiting
part of that Kingdome, were the inborne <HI>Britaines,</HI> and &s;uch as thither fled to auoid the <HI>Romane</HI> &s;erui|tude:
who&s;e names began fir&s;t to be di&s;tingui&s;hed vnder <HI>Diocle&s;ian</HI> the Emperour, when they were
termed <HI>Picts</HI> for painting their bodies, like the <HI>Britaines,</HI> as &s;uch <HI>Flauius Vigetius:</HI> which is more
&s;trengthened, for that the Northerne <HI>Britaines</HI> conuerted by Saint <HI>Columb,</HI> are called <HI>Britaine
Picts.</HI></P>
<P>(5) But the <HI>Highland-men</HI> (the naturall <HI>Scot</HI> indeed) are &s;uppo&s;ed to de&s;cend from the <HI>Scythi|ans,</HI>
who with the <HI>Getes</HI> infe&s;ting <HI>Ireland,</HI> left both their I&s;&s;ue there, and their manners, apparant in
the <HI>Wild-Iri&s;h</HI> euen to this day: And from <HI>Scithae</HI> (as is thought) the name of <HI>Scot</HI> grew; for &s;o the

<P>THe Traditions of time haue deliuered vnto vs diuers names, whereby this famous Iland is
recorded to haue beene called: yet none of more faire probabilitie, then that of <HI>Orpheus, A|ri&s;totle</HI>
and <HI>Claudian,</HI> by whom it is named <HI>Ierna:</HI> by <HI>Iuuenal</HI> and <HI>Mela</HI> called <HI>Iuuerna:</HI> by <HI>Dio|dorus

ari&s;e many opinions. Doubtle&s;&s;e it is, that <HI>Hibernia, Iuuerna,</HI> and <HI>Ouernia,</HI> came from <HI>Ierna,</HI>
&s;poken of by <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">pheus</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;totle;</HI> and the &s;ame <HI>Ierna,</HI> as al&s;o <HI>Iris, Iuerdhon,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> from <HI>Erin,</HI>

<P>(3) <HI>Fe&s;tus Auienus,</HI> in that little booke which he entituled <HI>Ora maritima</HI> calleth <HI>Ireland, Sacram

thence the name of <HI>Scotland,</HI> together with the <HI>Scots</HI> them&s;elues, came into <HI>Britaine.</HI></P>
<P>(4) For largene&s;&s;e and circuit, in times pa&s;t, this Iland challenged the third place in ranke of

glory; courteous to &s;trangers, con&s;tant in loue, light of beliefe, impatient of iniurie, giuen to fle&s;hly lu&s;ts, and
in enmitie implacable.</HI> At the baptizing of their Infants, their manner was, not to dip their right armes
into the water, that &s;o (as they thought) they might giue a more deepe and incurable blow; neuer
calling them by the names of their Parents while&s;t they liued together, but at their death tooke it
vpon them. Their women nur&s;ed not the children they bare; and they that nur&s;ed others, did affect
and loue them much more then their owne.</P>
<P>(16) So much were they giuen to fanta&s;ticall conceits, that they held it very ominous to giue
their neighbours fire vpon <HI>May-day:</HI> to eat an old egge, endangered the death of their hor&s;e: and be|fore
they ca&s;t in their &s;eed, they &s;end &s;alt into the field: to hang vp the &s;helles in the roofe, was a

of May, increa&s;ed their kines milke; and to &s;pit vpon Cattle, they held it good again&s;t Witchery,
whereof <HI>Ireland</HI> was full.</P>
<P>(17) Super&s;titious Idolatry among the wilde <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> was common, yeelding diuine honour vnto
the Moone after the change, vnto whom they both bowed their knees, and made &s;upplications; and
with a loud voice would thus &s;peake vnto that Planet: <HI>Wee pray thee leaue vs in as good e&s;tate as thou
found&s;t vs.</HI> Wolues they did make their God&s;ibs, terming them <HI>Chari Chri&s;t,</HI> and &s;o thought them|&s;elues
pre&s;erued from their hurts: the hoofes of dead hor&s;es they accounted and held &s;acred: about
childrens necks they hung the beginning of Saint <HI>Iohns</HI> Go&s;pell, a crooked naile of an hor&s;e-&s;hooe,
or a peece of a Wolues skinne; and both the &s;ucking-childe and nur&s;e were girt with girdles finely
plated of womans haire; &s;o farre they wandred into the wayes of errour, in making the&s;e armes the
&s;trength of their healths.</P>
<P>(18) Their wiues were many, by rea&s;on of diuorcements, and their maids married at twelue
<PB REF="183">
yeares of age, who&s;e cu&s;tomes were to &s;end to their louers, bracelets plated, and curiou&s;ly wrought of
their owne haire; &s;o farre following <HI>Venus</HI> in the knots of the&s;e a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">urements. The men wore linnen
&s;hirts exceedingly large, &s;tained with Saffron, the &s;leeues wide, and hanging to their knees, &s;trait and
&s;hort tru&s;tes plated thicke in the skirts, their breeches clo&s;e to the thighes, a &s;hort skeine hanging
point downe before, and a mantle mo&s;t times ca&s;t ouer their heads. The women wore their haire
plated in curious manner, hanging downe their backes and &s;houlders, from vnder &s;oulden wreathes
of fine linnen, rolled about their heads, rather loading the wearer, then delighting the beholder:
for as the one was mo&s;t &s;eemely, &s;o the other was vn&s;ightly: their neckes were hung with chaines
and carkaneths, their armes wreathed with many bracelets, and ouer their &s;ide-garments the &s;hagge

<P>(19) In warres they were forward, and fought with battle-axes, who&s;e bearers were called <HI>Gal|logla&s;&s;es,</HI>
the common Souldier but lightly armed, who &s;erued with darts and &s;harpe skeines; their
Trumpet was a Bagge-pipe, and word for encounter, <HI>Pharroh;</HI> which at the fir&s;t on&s;et with great
acclamation they vttered, and he that did not, was taken into the ayre, and carried into the vale of
<HI>Kerr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> where transformed (as they did beleeue) he remained vntill he was hunted with Hounds
from thence to his home.</P>
<P>(20) For the dying and dead they hired women to mourne, who expo&s;tulated with the &s;icke,
why he would die; and dead, at his Funerall &s;uch out-cries were made, &s;uch clapping of hands, &s;uch
howlings, and ge&s;tures, that one would thinke their &s;orrowes vnrecouerable, holding the opinion
of <HI>Pythagoras</HI> for the &s;oules departed.</P>
<P>(21) Their dyet in nece&s;&s;itie was &s;lender, feeding vpon water-cre&s;&s;es, rootes, mu&s;hromes, &s;ham|rogh,
butter tempered with oat-meale, milke, whey, yea, and raw fle&s;h, the bloud being cru&s;hed out:

their v&s;e was al&s;o to let their kine bloud, which &s;tanding a while, and comming to a ielly, with but|ter
they did eat, as a very good di&s;h.</P>
<P>(22) That the Go&s;pell of Chri&s;t &s;hould be preached in <HI>Ireland</HI> by <HI>Iames</HI> the Apo&s;tle, I will not
affirme, though <HI>Vincentius</HI> hath &s;aid it: neither will I, with the <HI>Scots,</HI> bring the Ilands conuer&s;ion from

Queene her husband, and he againe his Subiects, till all became Chri&s;tians. But mo&s;t true it is, that
the <HI>Scots</HI> fir&s;t receiued the doctrine of Chri&s;t in this Kingdome of <HI>Ireland;</HI> for thus writeth <HI>Pro&s;per:

to be turned and transformed into formes which they are not. Some againe embrace another
ridiculous opinion, and per&s;wade them&s;elues, that he who in the barbarous acclamation and outcry

<P>THis Country, the Natiues call <HI>Leighnigh,</HI> the <HI>Britaines Lein;</HI> in <HI>Latine, Lagenia;</HI> in the anci|ent
liues of the Saints, <HI>Lagen;</HI> and in <HI>Engli&s;h, Lein&s;ter.</HI> It lieth Ea&s;tward along <HI>Hibernicum</HI>

Territorie of <HI>Louth,</HI> and the South with part of the Prouince of <HI>Moun&s;ter.</HI> This Country
butteth vpon <HI>England,</HI> as <HI>Moun&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Connaught</HI> doe vpon <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme thereof is triangle, and &s;ides not much vnequall, from her South-Ea&s;t vnto the
We&s;t-point about 80. miles, from thence to her North-We&s;t about 70. miles, and her Ea&s;t Coa&s;t a|long
the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Sea-&s;hore, eightie miles: the circumference vpon two hundred and &s;eauentie miles.</P>
<P>(3) The aire is cleare and gentle, mixt with a temperate di&s;po&s;ition, yeelding neither extremitie
of heat or cold, according to the &s;ea&s;onable times of the yeare, and the naturall condition of the
Continent. The &s;oile is generally fruitfull, plentifull both in fi&s;h and fle&s;h, and in other victuals,
as butter, chee&s;e, and mile. It is fertile in Corne, Cattle, and pa&s;ture grounds, and would be much
more, if the husbandman did but apply his indu&s;try, to which he is inuited by the commodiou&s;ne&s;&s;e
of the Country. It is well watered with Riuers, and for the mo&s;t part well woodded, except the
Countie of <HI>Diuelin,</HI> which complaines much of that want, being &s;o de&s;titute of wood, that they are
compelled to v&s;e a clammie kinde of fat turffe for their fuell, or Sea-coale brought out of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>(4) The Inhabitants of the&s;e parts in <HI>Ptolemies</HI> dayes were the <HI>Brigantes, Mena<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">, Cauci,</HI> and <HI>Bla|in;</HI>

<P>(5) The commodities of this Country doe chiefly con&s;i&s;t in Cattle, Sea-fowle, and Fi&s;h. It
breeds many excellent good hor&s;es, called <HI>Iri&s;h Hobbies,</HI> which haue not the &s;ame pace that other
hor&s;es haue in their cour&s;e, but a &s;oft and round amble, &s;etting very ea&s;ily.</P>
<P>(6) This Country hath in it three Riuers of note, termed in old time the three &s;i&s;ters, <HI>Shour,
Neor,</HI> and <HI>Barraeo,</HI> which i&s;&s;ue out of the huge Mountaine (called by <HI>Giraldus, Bladina Montes)</HI> as

Channels, before they emptie them&s;elues into the Ocean, ioyne hand in hand all together in a mu|tuall
league and combination.</P>
<P>(7) Places very dangerous for &s;hipping are certaine fiats and &s;hallowes in the Sea, that lie ouer

<P>This Citie in times pa&s;t, for the due admini&s;tration of Ciuill Gouernment, had a Prouo&s;t for the

libertie to chu&s;e euery yeare a Maior and two Baili&s;tes, and that the Maior &s;hould haue a gilt &s;word
carried before him for euer. And King <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixt (to heape more honour vpon this place)
changed the two Bailiffes afterwards into Sheriffes: &s;o that there is not any thing here wanting that

butting again&s;t the Kingdome of <HI>Spaine.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme thereof is long, and towards the North and South ends, thinne and narrow;
but as it growes towards the middle, from either part it waxeth &s;till bigger and bigger: extending in
length from the Riuer <HI>Shennon</HI> in her South, to <HI>Enis Kelling</HI> in her North, 126. miles, and the broade&s;t
part is from <HI>Tromer</HI> in her Ea&s;t, to <HI>Barragh-Bay</HI> in her We&s;t, containing about foure&s;core miles.
The whole in circuit and compa&s;&s;e is aboue foure hundred miles.</P>

of certaine moi&s;t places (couered ouer with gra&s;&s;e) which of their &s;oftne&s;&s;e are v&s;ually termed

to the re&s;t. <HI>Galway</HI> is a land very thankfull to the painefull husbandman, and no le&s;&s;e com|modious

<PB REF="192">
both with plea&s;ure and fertility, abundantly rich in Cattle, Deere, Hawkes, and plenty of Hony.
<HI>Slego</HI> (coa&s;ting vpon the Sea) is a plenteous Country for feeding and rai&s;ing of Cattle. <HI>Le-Trim</HI> (a
place ri&s;ing vp throughout with hilles) is &s;o full of ranke gra&s;&s;e and forrage, that (as <HI>Solinus</HI> repor|teth)
if Cattle were not kept &s;ometimes from gra&s;ing, their fulne&s;&s;e would endanger them. And

<P>(5) Such as in ancient time made their abode and habitations in this Prouince, were the GAN|GANI,

may &s;eeme al&s;o to haue fetcht their deriuation from the <HI>Concan</HI> (Nation of the &s;elfe-&s;ame Coun|try)
both by the affinitie of name, and vicinitie of place. In <HI>Strabo,</HI> according to the diuer&s;itie of

of <HI>Mac-William)</HI> who v&s;urping a tyrannie in the&s;e parts, raged &s;ometimes vpon them&s;elues, with
mutuall iniuries, and oppre&s;&s;ed the poore people a long time with extorting, pilling, and &s;poiling;
&s;o as they left &s;carce one hou&s;e in the Country vnrifled, or vnra&s;ed; but were bridled and repre&s;&s;ed
(euen in our remebrance) by the &s;eueritie and re&s;olution of the Commi&s;&s;ioner of tho&s;e their
vniu&s;t doings, would be a meanes to draw the people away from the due obedience to their Prince:
&s;uch therefore as refu&s;ed to obey the lawes, and &s;ided with the tumultuous, with all care and dili|gence
he &s;oone &s;cattered, forcing their Forts, and driuing them into woods and lurking holes (for
troubling the ble&s;&s;ed e&s;tate of tranquilitie) till the Lord Deputie, who tooke pitie of them, vpon
their humble &s;upplication, commanded by his mi&s;&s;iues, that they &s;hould be receiued vpon tearmes
<PB REF="193">
of peace. But they being a &s;tiffenecked people, tooke armes againe, entred a-fre&s;h into actuall re|bellion,
draue away booties, made foule vprores, and vpon faire promi&s;es procured the aid of the
<HI>Scotti&s;h</HI> Ilanders, from out of the <HI>Hebrides:</HI> whereupon the Gouernour a&s;&s;embled an Armie, and
pur&s;ued them with &s;uch powerfull violence through the Woods and Forre&s;ts, that after &s;ixe or &s;ea|uen
weekes, being grieuou&s;ly hunger-bitten, they &s;ubmitted them&s;elues in all humilitie. The Auxi|liarie

he put them to flight, after he had killed and drowned about three thou&s;and of them in the Riuer
<HI>Moin.</HI></P>
<P>(8) About the yeare 1316. there was &s;uch a great &s;laughter made of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> in this Prouince
of <HI>Connaught,</HI> through a quarrell that aro&s;e there betweene two Lords or Princes, that there were
&s;laine on both &s;ides about foure thou&s;and men; and &s;o great a tribulation at that time came vpon
the people, that they did deuoure and eat one another, &s;o as of 10000. there remained not aboue
200. liuing. And it is reported for truth, that the people were then &s;o hunger-&s;tarued, that in
Church-yards they tooke the dead bodies out of their graues, and in their &s;culs boiled the fle&s;h, and
fed vpon it: yea, and that women did eat their owne children. Thus appeared the ire and anger of
God, in puni&s;hing their &s;innes, and &s;eeking their conuer&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>THE PROVINCE OF VLSTER.
CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<P>THis Prouince, called by our <HI>Wel&s;h-Britaines Vltw,</HI> in <HI>Iri&s;h Cui Guilly,</HI> in <HI>Latine Vltonia,</HI> and <HI>V|lidia,</HI>
in <HI>Engli&s;h V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ier;</HI> on the North is diuided by a narrow Sea from <HI>Scotland;</HI> South-ward
it extends it &s;elfe to <HI>Connagh</HI> and <HI>Lein&s;ter;</HI> the Ea&s;t part lieth vpon the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Sea; and the We&s;t
part is continually beaten with the boi&s;terous rage of the maine We&s;t Ocean. This Pro|uince
and furthe&s;t part of <HI>Ireland,</HI> affronteth the <HI>Scoti&s;h Ilands,</HI> which are called the <HI>Hebrides,</HI>
and are &s;cattered in the Seas betweene both Kingdomes; who&s;e Inhabitants at this day is the <HI>Iri&s;h-Scot,</HI>
&s;ucce&s;&s;our of the old <HI>Scythian.</HI></P>
<P>(2) The forme thereof is round, reaching in length from <HI>Coldagh</HI>-Hauen in her North, to <HI>Kil|more</HI>
in her South, neere an hundred miles; and in bredth from <HI>Black-Abbey</HI> in her Ea&s;t, to <HI>Calebegh</HI>
point in her We&s;t, one hundred thirtie and odde miles: The whole in circumference, about foure
hundred and twentie miles.</P>
<P>(3) This Country &s;eldome feeleth any vn&s;ea&s;onable extremities, the quicke and flexible windes
cooling the heat of Summer, and &s;oft and gentle &s;howers mollifie the hardne&s;&s;e of the Winter.
Briefly, the frozen nor torrid Zone haue not here any v&s;urpation; the clouds in the aire very &s;weet
and plea&s;ant, yea, and when they are mo&s;t impure, are not vnwhole&s;ome, nor of long continuance,
the rough windes holding them in continuall agitation.</P>
<P>(4) This equall temperature cau&s;eth the ground to bring forth great &s;tore of &s;euerall Trees,
both fit for building, and bearing of fruit; plentifull of gra&s;&s;e for the feeding of Cattle, and is a|bundantly
furni&s;hed with Hor&s;es, Sheepe and Oxen; the Riuers likewi&s;e pay double tribute, deepe
enough to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">arry Ve&s;&s;els either for plea&s;ure or profit, and Fi&s;h great &s;tore, both for their owne v&s;es,
<PB REF="195">
and commoditie of others. <HI>Salmons</HI> in &s;ome Riuers of this County abound more in number then
in any Riuer of <HI>Europe.</HI> To &s;peake (in generall) though in &s;ome places it be &s;omewhat barren,
troubled with <HI>Loughes, Lakes,</HI> and thicke Woods, yet is it euery where fre&s;h, and full of Cattle and
forrage, ready at all times to an&s;wer the husbandmans paines. But nature is there &s;o little behol|ding
to Art or Indu&s;try, that the various &s;hew vpon bankes, the &s;hady groues, the greene meadowes,
hanging hilles, and fields fit for Corne, (if they were manured) doe &s;eeme to be angry with their
Inhabitants for &s;uffering all to grow wild and harbarous, through their owne negligence.</P>
<P>(5) This Country in <HI>Ptolemies</HI> dayes was wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Volutij, Darni, Robogdji,</HI> and <HI>Er|dini,</HI>
who branched and &s;pred them&s;elues into the &s;euerall parts that I&s;land.</P>
<P>(6) The people of this Prouince were accu&s;tomed in controuer&s;ies and &s;olemne prote&s;tations,
to &s;weare by S. <HI>Patrickes Staffe,</HI> which oath they feared more to breake, then if they had &s;worne by
the holy <HI>Euangeli&s;t&punc;</HI> Their ancient cu&s;tome in making their King, was this: A white Cow was taken,
which the King mu&s;t kill, and &s;eeth the &s;ame in water whole, then mu&s;t he bathe him&s;elfe therein
&s;tarke naked; and &s;itting in the Cawdron wherein it was &s;od, accompanied with his people round
about him, he and they v&s;ed to eat the fle&s;h and drinke the broath wherein he &s;ate, without cup, or
di&s;h, or v&s;e of hand. How farre the&s;e pre&s;criptions and cu&s;tomes were different from the conformi|ties
of other ciuill Monarchies, we may well perceiue by the&s;e and other like ob&s;eruations of tho&s;e
gro&s;&s;e times, and as yet they are more barbarous then is any other part of the I&s;land be&s;ides.</P>
<P>(7) Hi&s;torians relating of <HI>Ireland,</HI> tell of &s;euerall I&s;lands in the &s;euerall Prouinces: &s;ome full of
Angels, &s;ome full of Deuils; &s;ome for male onely, &s;ome for female; &s;ome where none may liue,
&s;ome where none can die; and &s;uch effects of trees, &s;tones, and waters, that a man (but of ea&s;ie con|ceit)
may well e&s;teeme them as heedle&s;&s;e as vncertaine. So al&s;o S. <HI>Patrickes</HI> Purgatorie (a thing of
much note in the Tract of this Prouince) is a vault or narrow caue in the ground, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB REF="196">
(called <HI>Erne Liffer)</HI> much &s;poken of, by rea&s;on of (I wot not what) fearefull walking &s;pirits and
dreadfull apparitions, (or rather &s;ome religious horrour) which (as &s;ome ridiculou&s;ly dreame)
was digd by <HI>Vly&s;&s;es</HI> when he went downe to parley with tho&s;e in hell. This is the caue which the
Inhabitants in the&s;e dayes call <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">llanu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Frugadory,</HI> that is, <HI>The I&s;le of Purgatory,</HI> and S. <HI>Patricks Par|gatory:</HI>
for &s;ome per&s;ons, le&s;&s;e deuout then credulous, affirme that S. <HI>Patricke</HI> (or rather <HI>Patricius
Secundus</HI> an holy Abbot of that name) labouring the conuer&s;ion of the people of this Prouince,
and much inforcing the life to come, they replied contemptuou&s;ly vnto him, that vnle&s;&s;e they &s;aw
proofes of tho&s;e joyes and paines he preached, they would not lo&s;e the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their pre&s;ent
plea&s;ures, in hope or feare of things to come, they wi&s;t not when Whereupon (as they &s;ay) he ob|tained
at Gods hands by earne&s;t prayer, that the puni&s;hments and torments which the godle&s;&s;e are
to &s;uffer after this life, might be there pre&s;ented to the eye, that &s;o he might more ea&s;ily root out the
&s;innes and Heatheni&s;h errours, that &s;tucke &s;o fa&s;t in the hearts of the <HI>Iri&s;h.</HI> But touching the credit
hereof (although common fame, and &s;ome records doe vtter it) I neither will vrge the beliefe,
nor regard, &s;eeing it is no Article of our Creed.</P>
<P>(8) Matters memorable within this Prouince are the&s;e: fir&s;t, that the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Ireland</HI> were
wont to be con&s;ecrated by the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> in regard of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> which they had
in this Country; vntill &s;uch time as <HI>Iohn Pap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI> a Cardinall was &s;ent thither from Pop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Eugenius</HI>

there were tran&s;lations, and pluralities of Bi&s;hops, according to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> and plea&s;ure of the Metro|politane&punc;
Al&s;o that the <HI>Iri&s;h-men</HI> were accu&s;tomed to leaue and for&s;ake <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> wedded wiues at their
owne free willes, whereof <HI>Lanfrancke</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> complained vnto <HI>Theraelua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> a King
of <HI>Ireland.</HI> And had not this Nation beene corrupted with this vice, euen vnto the&s;e our dayes;
both the right of lineall &s;ucce&s;&s;ion had beene more certaine among them, and the Gentry and
<PB REF="196">
Comminaltie had not in &s;uch cruelties imbrued them&s;elues, with &s;uch effu&s;ion of their owne kin|dreds
bloud, about their inheritances and legitimation.</P>
<P>(9) The principall place in this Tract is <HI>Armagh,</HI> neere vnto the Riuer <HI>Kalin,</HI> which (albeit it
maketh a poore &s;hew) is the <HI>Archiepi&s;copall See</HI> and <HI>Metropolitane</HI> of the whole I&s;land. Before Saint
<HI>Patricke</HI> had built there a faire Citie, for &s;ite, forme, quantitie, and compa&s;&s;e, modelled out (as he
&s;aith) by the appointment and direction of Angels, this place was named <HI>Drumfalrch;</HI> the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> tell
much that it receiued the name of Queene <HI>Armacha:</HI> but the better opinions are, that it is the &s;ame
which <HI>Bede</HI> calleth <HI>Dearmach,</HI> and out of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> language interpreteth it, <HI>The Field of
Oakes.</HI> Here (as S. <HI>Bernard</HI> writeth) S. <HI>Patricke</HI> the Apo&s;tle of <HI>Ireland</HI> ruled in his life time, and
re&s;ted after death: in honor of whom it was of &s;uch venerable e&s;timation in old time, that not one|ly
Bi&s;hops and Prie&s;ts, but Kings al&s;o and Princes were (in generall) &s;ubiect to the Metropolitane
thereof in all obedience, and to his gouernment alone. Among the Archbi&s;hops of this Prouince,
S. <HI>Malachy</HI> is famou&s;ed, who fir&s;t prohibited Prie&s;ts marriage in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and (as S. <HI>Bernard</HI> &s;aith,
who wrote his life at large) borrowed no more of the natiue barbarou&s;ne&s;&s;e of that Country, then
<HI>Sea-fi&s;hes</HI> doe &s;altne&s;&s;e of the Seas. Al&s;o <HI>Richard Fitz Ralf</HI> (commonly called <HI>Armachanus)</HI> is of
famous memory, who turning the edge of his &s;tile, about the yeare 1355. began to oppo&s;e his opi|nion
again&s;t the Order of <HI>Mendicant Friers,</HI> as dete&s;ting in Chri&s;tians &s;uch voluntary begging. The
chiefe Fort in this Tract is <HI>Enis Kelling,</HI> defended by the Rebels in the yeare 1593 and wonne by
<HI>Dowdall</HI> a mo&s;t valiant Captaine: neere vnto which is a great downfall of water, termed <HI>The Salmon
Leape:</HI> of which there is a common &s;peech currant among the Inhabitants, that it was once firme
ground very populous and well husbanded with tillage; till it was &s;uddenly ouer flowne with wa|ters,
and turned into a Lake, for &s;ome filthy abominable acts of the people again&s;t Nature com|mitted
with bea&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB REF="197">
(10) The places of Religion, &s;eque&s;tred from other worldly &s;eruices, and con&s;ecrated to holy
purpo&s;es, erected in this Prouince, were: The Abbey which &s;heweth it &s;elfe at <HI>Donegal:</HI> The Mona|&s;tery

of <HI>Pilgrims,</HI> till Time proued their deuotions to be erronious, and the pure light of the word
reuealed, opening the eyes of their vnder&s;tanding, hath taught them to &s;hake off the &s;hame of &s;uch
