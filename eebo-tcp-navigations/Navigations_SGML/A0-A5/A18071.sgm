<P>Concerning the matter of this discourse, you shall finde in the Preface: and concerning the ma|ner, there is no great matter of learning or ingeni|ous inuention, onely a simple relation of a simple truth; yet somewhat there is, which may happily concerne the learned, and giue some satisfaction to an indifferent Reader, when hee vnderstands, how two of the most mightie and most warlike Princes among the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> the great <HI>Turke</HI> and the <HI>Persian,</HI> are now in armes one against the other; stirred vp thereunto by two of our Country-men, Sir <HI>Anthonie Sherley,</HI> and Master <HI>Robert Sherley</HI> his brother.</P>
<P>A warre not onely like to be long and bloudie, but also very commodious and of great oportuni|tie to the Christian Commonweale: for that it doth g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aunt and giue leasure to diuers parts of Christen|dome to refresh themselues, and to increase their forces, much weakned, both by the Great Turkes warres; and most of all by their ciuill dissentions at home.

<P>Finally, I might haue added many worthy col|lections, as well out of sacred as prophane writers, that haue written of the most stately and magnifi|cent Empire of the <HI>Medes</HI> and <HI>Persians</HI> in times past, and so haue compared it, with the moderne and present estate thereof; which hath scarce a shadow of the antique Gouernment, wherewith it was then ruled and gouerned.

not as a Philosopher, but as a true Diuine, saying, <HI>Fatales esse Imperiorum periodos,</HI> the prouidence of God is most sure and certaine; which <HI>Pompey</HI> found most true, in a small time after, when <HI>Caesar</HI> was created the first Emperour of the Roman Monarchy; and which also shall be verified (God willing) in the discourse of this Iournall: wherein is principally shewed, how all humane affaires, and the grea|test Cities of renowme haue had their Periods in their greatest perfections; to which though they haue ascended <HI>gradatim,</HI> yet they haue forthwith fallen into a retrograde of declination, till they haue beene brought to the lowest degree which misery can allot: So true is that of <HI>Seneca.</HI>

For in this small discourse wee shall see how vnauoidable destruction doth alwaies attend on the succession of great|nesse, and aduancement on the posterity of misery: as also the sacking of many Cities, the depopulating of the grea|test Countries, the deposing of Princes, and high descen|ded families of their liues, together with their Crownes and Kingdomes, and that in so short a time, as neuer the like was executed in the antique world. Two reasons haue moued me to set downe this Iournall:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he causes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> moued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Authour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> write this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">urnall.</NOTE> The one for that I haue not yet seene any that hath made a full description of these parts, as they are at this day, which I hope shall be performed by my selfe, who spent much time in those Countries, being familiarly conuersant (to helpe my know|ledge

<P>Finally, you haue here described the seueral Nations, Si|tuations, Cities, Riuers, Mountaines, and Prouinces, which I haue seene and passed by.

<HEAD>The beginning of the trauell.</HEAD>
<P>_ANd first I will beginne at <HI>Alexandretta: Alexandretta</HI> now called <HI>Scanderone,</HI> is a roade in the bottom of the <HI>Mediterranean-Sea,</HI> on the coast of <HI>Cilicia,</HI> where our Mer|chants land their goods to be sent to <HI>A|leppo:</HI> within eight miles of this roade is <HI>Tharsus,</HI> the chiefe Citty of <HI>Cilicia,</HI> and the Countrey of S^t. <HI>Paul:</HI> the place also where King <HI>Salomon</HI> sent for great store of gold, and other prouision for the building of the Temple: whither the Prophet <HI>Ionas</HI> also sledde, when he should haue gone to <HI>Nineuie.</HI> A little from this Towne did <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great giue the ouerthrow in person to <HI>Da|rius,</HI> in ioyning of their first battell together.</P>
<P>Lying at an Anchor in the aforesaid roade the space of two houres, our <HI>Ianizaries</HI> with a sufficient guard and horses for our selues, were ready to conduct vs vp to <HI>Alep|po,</HI> and safe-guard vs as well a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they might, from the dan|gers and euils, which many times in the way doth befall passengers. In our passage vp, no matter of importance happened: many false rumours of Theeues were diuulged by the Countrey people, to affright vs; but we by the as|sistance of God arriued in safety at <HI>Aleppo,</HI> being some sixe miles before our approch to the Citty, encountred by ma|ny of our English Merchants, to giue vs the welcome on the Turkish shore. After mutuall courtesies ended, they accompanied vs into the City vnto the <HI>Consull</HI> Pallace; where hauing dismounted our selues, we were well enter|tained by M^r. <HI>Richard Colethrust</HI> worthy <HI>Consull</HI> then to our worthy English nation.

<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The description of Tripolis.</HEAD>
<P><HI>TRipolis</HI> is a Towne which standeth vnder a part of Mount <HI>Lybanus,</HI> two English miles distant from a certaine Port, which trendeth in the forme of an halfe Moone, hauing on the one side thereof fiue block-houses, or small Forts, wherein is very good Artillery, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ept by an hundred <HI>Ianizaries.</HI> This City is as great as <HI>Bristow,</HI> and walled about, the walles being of no great force. The chiefest strength is a Citadell, which standeth on the South side within the walles, and ouer-lookes the whole Towne, and is strongly kept with two hundred <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> and good Artillery. Through the midst of this City passeth a Riuer, wherewith they water their Gardens and Mulbery
<PB N="6" REF="7">
trees, in such sort that there grow on them abundance of silke wormes, where with the Inhabitants makes great store of very white silke, which is the chiefest naturall commodi|ty in and about this place. Finally, this roade of <HI>Tarapolos</HI> or <HI>Trapolos,</HI> commonly called <HI>Tripolis,</HI> was more frequen|ted (before <HI>Scanderone</HI> was found out) with all sorts of Christian Merchants, as <HI>Venetians, Genouis, Florentines, Marsilians, Sicilians, Raguses,</HI> and <HI>English</HI> men, then any other Port of the great Turks Dominions. Some say that the Scale is againe translated from <HI>Scanderone</HI> thither, but how true it is, I leaue to the Merchants to report. One inconuenience this Towne is subiect vnto: for right be|fore it toward the Sea is a banke of mouing sand, which gathereth and increaseth with the Westerne winds in such sort, that according to an old prophesie amongst them, this banke is like to swallow vp and ouerwhelme the Towne: for euery yeare it increaseth more and more, and eateth vp many Gardens and Orchards, albeit they vse all pollicy to diminish the same, and to make it firme ground.</P>

<P>THree dayes iourney from this Towne in the mid-way to <HI>Aleppo</HI> standeth <HI>Hamath,</HI> a City of great Anti|quity, and very famous in the Scripture: for it was deliue|red vp into the hands of <HI>Dauid</HI> by <HI>Toi,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Numb.</HI> 13.22. 1. <HI>Chro.</HI> 1.16. 2. <HI>Sam.</HI> 8.9.</NOTE> who was King of the same. It standeth on a very goodly plaine, replenished a|bundantly with cornemand cotton-wooll; but is much rui|nated, and falleth more and more to decay, and at this day there is scarse one halfe of the wall standing, which hath beene very faire and strong: but because it cost many mens liues to winne it; the great Turke will not haue it repaired, commanding these wordes to be set ouer the Castle gate, which standeth in the midst of the Towne, in the <HI>Arabian</HI> tongue: <HI>Cursed be the Father and the Sonne, that shall lay their hands to the repairing of this place.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The description of Antioch.</HEAD>
<P>NOt farre from this Towne is the famous City <HI>An|tioch,</HI> which in ancient time was called <HI>Epidaphane,</HI> or <HI>Epiphane,</HI> and of the Hebrewes <HI>Reblatha,</HI> sometime the Seate of the <HI>Syrian</HI> Kings, and afterwards the Metropoliti|call City of <HI>Syria,</HI> hauing vnder it an hundred and fifty Bi|shops: famous for many things, but amongst the rest, be|cause it was the seate of the blessed Apostle S^t. <HI>Peter,</HI> and because it was the first place, where the professors of Chri|stian religion tooke the name of Christians. This City ly|eth vpon the Riuer <HI>Orontes,</HI> in Scripture called <HI>Farfar,</HI> about twelue miles from the Sea, and was once strongly fortified both by nature on the one side by high broken Mountaines, and on the other side by Art, being compas|sed about with a double wall, the vttermost whereof is of hard stone, of an huge bignesse, and the other of bricke with foure hundred and sixty towers on the same, and an impregnable Castle at the East-end thereof, whereunto was ioyning a deepe lake, comming out of the great Ri|uer, which wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ereth the South-side of the City.</P>
<P>But in the yeare of Grace 1187. <HI>Saladin Sultan</HI> of <HI>Ae|gypt,</HI> dealt so cunningly with the Patriarke, that by his meanes the Castle (otherwise almost impregnable) was for gold betrayed vnto him. By meanes whereof <HI>Saladin</HI> in a short time, became Lord and Master of that famous City (which was hardly gained by the whole power of the Christians, after eleuen moneths siege) and with it fiue and twenty Cities moe, that depended of the fortune thereof, with all the Prouinces belonging thereunto; and so now at this day the splendor and beauty thereof is altogether Eclipsed by the Turkes, there resting and remaining in the midst of the ruinous walles a small village to be seene.</P>
<P>Close by the walles of this ruinous Towne runneth the Riuer <HI>Orontes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Riuer O|rontes.</NOTE> which courseth through the large and spa|cious
<PB N="8" REF="8">
plaine of <HI>Antioch,</HI> being numbred amongst the fa|mous riuers of <HI>Syria,</HI> whose bankes I haue viewed, euen from his springing head to his maine channell, which is neere to <HI>Selencia Pieria,</HI> now called <HI>Soldin.</HI> This riuer a|mongst the Turkes and Arabians hath quite lost his aunci|ent name: but because it runneth very swiftly in his course, and hath many turnings and windings, (so that those that swimme in it are oftentimes drowned) as though the poore riuer had in that respect the nature of a murderer; therefore the Turkes and the Moores doe now giue it a name, that expresly signifieth a murderer or traytor.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The description of Aleppo.</HEAD>
<P>FRom this miserable towne we spent a dayes iourney and halfe to the rich and wealthy Citie of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> which in ancient time was called <HI>Heliopolis,</HI> and was that ancient <HI>Haram</HI> mentioned so often in Scripture. The Moores doe call it <HI>Halip,</HI> which in our tongue signifieth milke, for the same Arabians doe say, that it was so called for the a|bundance of milke, which in the time of the Patriarkes was y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">elded by the heards and flockes of cattell, which fed in those champaines. This Citie standeth in the Prouince of <HI>Camogena,</HI> which runneth vp to <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and to the confines of <HI>Armenia,</HI> and is now become the third capitall citie of the Turkish Empire. And well it may be so accoun|ted, since it is the greatest place of traffique for a dry towne in all those parts: for hither resort <HI>Iewes, Tartarians, Per|sians, Armenians, Egyptians, Indians,</HI> &amp; many sorts of Chri|stians, all enioying freedome of conscience, and bringing thither all kindes of rich merchandise: the trade and traf|ficke of which place, because it is so well known to most of our nation, I omit to write of.</P>
<P>The ayre of this Citie is much pleasing and delightfull to a sound and healthfull body, but very piercing and dange|rous for such as haue receiued any contagion at <HI>Scanderon</HI>;
<PB N="9" REF="8">
and therefore it is not good for any passenger to lie long at that roade, but to hasten at his first arriuall so soone as he can vp farder into the Countrey. This City lyeth vpon the Riuer <HI>Singa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Riuer Synga.</NOTE> which as some report a Souldier of <HI>Grand Caire</HI> drew from <HI>Euphrates,</HI> and hath a channell vnder ground, which produceth many fountaines both publike and priuate, yeelding no small pleasure and contentment to the inhabitants. It containeth in circuit foure hils, vpon one of which is raised a goodly Castle, hauing a deepe ditch intrenched round about, and a bridge ascending step by step, with foure gates, before you can passe into the Ca|stle it selfe, being guarded with a strong and sure garrison of foure or fiue hundred <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> both to curbe the re|bellion of the City, and to keep it from forraigne inuasion. The walles of this City are about three English miles in compasse, and the suburbs almost as much more: and round about for foure miles space are goodly Gardens, Or|chards, and Vineyards, which beare abundance of delicate fruits, and of the best Wines, which are notwithstanding very deare, by reason of the quantity thereof, that there is sold and eaten. The number of people which resort to this City may easily be comprehended, sith betweene the City and the suburbs in the yeare of Grace 1555. there dyed of the plague more then an hundred and twenty thousand persons in three Moneths. No building of importance is here to be seen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s are storehouses for forraigne Mer|chants.</NOTE> saue the Temples or Moschees, and Caines, all fabricated of hard quarry stone, arched and vaulted with Cesternes full of water in the middest of the Courts. In a word this City is one of the most famous Marts of the East: the customes that are paied by our English nation, the French, the Venetians, the huge Carauans, which come from <HI>Balsara, Persia, Mecha,</HI> are exceeding great, and therefore may well obtayne the third place of the Turkish Empire.</P>
<P>Neuerthelesse it hath indured diuers changes and sundry alterations, being in the yeare 1177. betrayed and taken
<PB N="10" REF="9">
from the Christians by <HI>Saladin Sultan</HI> of <HI>Damascus</HI>; but afterwards in the yeare 1260. it was againe recouered by <HI>Haalon</HI> the <HI>Tartar,</HI> who hauing receiued the Christian faith was sent of purpose by <HI>Mango</HI> the great <HI>Cham</HI> of Tartary a Christian also, with a puissant army and a world of people to releeue the distressed Christians in <HI>Syria</HI>; and so <HI>Haalon</HI> with <HI>Hayton</HI> king of <HI>Armenia,</HI> scouring through the Countries of <HI>Persia, Asiria,</HI> and <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> in the end entred into <HI>Syria,</HI> and in a few dayes tooke <HI>Aleppo,</HI> sacking and razing it downe to the ground. But it conti|nued not so long; for afterwards being repaired by the Christians, it was againe taken by the <HI>Sultans</HI> of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> who possessed it many yeares, but in the yeare 1516. when <HI>Campson Ganrus</HI> raigned in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> it was peaceably deli|uered vp by <HI>Cayerbeius</HI> the Traitor, into the hands of <HI>Se|lymus</HI> the first, who fauourably tooke the Citizens into his protection; and the more to winne their hearts, graunted vnto them greater priuiledges then they had in former time inioyed.

<P>Being arriued on the bankes of <HI>Euphrates,</HI> we found it as broade as the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Lambith</HI>; but in some places it is narrower, in some broader, running with a very swift streame and current, almost as fast as the Riuer of Trent. At this place doth this Riuer beginne to take his name, be|ing here all gathered into one channell, whereas before it commeth downe from the lake <HI>Chieldor-Giol</HI> in <HI>Armenia,</HI> in manifold armes and branches, and therefore is called by the Countrey people, by a name which signifieth a thou|sand heads.

The Boates are flat bottomed, because the Riuer is shallow in many places; so that when they trauell in the Moneths of Iuly, August, and September, they finde the Riuer at so low an ebbe, that they are faine to carry with them a spare Boate or two, to lighten their owne, if they should chance to fall on the shoales. Euery night after Sunne-set, they fasten these Boats to a stake, the Merchants lying aboord, and the Marriners vpon the shore, as neare as they can vnto the same. In this passage downe the Ri|uer, you shall meete with diuers troupes of <HI>Arabians,</HI> who will barter their prouision of dyet (for they care not for money) as Hennes, Kids, Lambe, Butter, and sowre milke, for Glasses, Combes, Corall, Amber, Kniues, Bread and Pomegranates, Pilles, wherewith they vse to tanne their

<P>But to returne where we left, wee were constrained by the deepnesse of the riuer to ferry ouer our whole <HI>Carauan,</HI> which consisted of a thousand persons, besides Camels, Horses, Mules, and Asses, by reason of which multitude we spent a whole day in transporting ouer the said <HI>Carauan.</HI> The gaines of which transportation yeelded the ferriman a Shaughoe, which is fiue pence English vpon a beast.

This City is built foure-square; the West part standing on the side of a rocky mountayne, and the East part trendeth into a spacious valley, replenish|ed with vineyards, orchards, and gardens: the walles are very strong, furnished with great store of artillery, and con|taine in circuit three English miles: and for the gallantnes of the site, it was once reckoned the Metropoliticall seate of <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> howsoeuer it is now translated to <HI>Cara|mida</HI> or <HI>Caraemit.</HI> There is in this City a fountaine full of fishes, so vsed to hand, that they will receiue any sustenance that shall be offered vnto them: both <HI>Iewes, Armenians,</HI> and <HI>Turkes</HI> reported vnto vs, that this fountaine was <HI>Ia|cobs</HI>-well,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 29.13.27.</NOTE> and that here hee serued his Vncle <HI>Laban</HI> twise <HI>seauen yeares, for faire and beautifull Rachel.</HI></P>

This plaine is very pleasant to the eye, by rea|son of the faire meadowes and brookes, wherewith the same doth plentifully abound. In this place did <HI>Aladeules</HI> build diuers houses of pleasures, causing the same to be in|habited with the fairest young men and women that could be found; so that, when he had surprised any young man, he brought him to this Fortresse, and gaue vnto him a drinke, which should cause him to sleepe so soundly, that he should so remaine a long space, as though he had beene dead. Then would he cause him to be carried into this val|ley amongst his beautifull women, and to bee cloathed in rich apparell, so that awaking out of his trance hee should finde himselfe another man, and as though hee came into a new world. Forthwith he was entertained with all kinds of pleasures, which youth and lust could desire, and this continued so long as one whole day lasted. But at night after a certaine banket, the drinke as before againe was gi|uen him to make him sleepe, his sumptuous attire pulled off, and his former garments put on, and so carried againe into the Fortresse from whence he came, a place farre vn|like to that which he had beene in the day before.</P>
<P>Hereupon the mountaine King would inferre, that the place where he had beene in, was Paradise, and that it lay in his power to send him thither when he would; if there|fore he had a desire to continue in such happinesse for euer, it was graunted vnto him vpon this condition, that hee should take courage to aduenture his life in such seruice, as hee should command him. To which those desperate villaines most willingly consented, as not esteeming any aduenture dangerous, yea though it were with the losse of their owne liues, so they might attaine that vaine Paradise, which <HI>Aladeules</HI> had promised vnto them. <HI>Selim</HI> the great Turke had like to haue lost his life, together with other <HI>Princes,</HI> too long to recite, by these desperate ruffians: But <HI>Selim</HI> in his returne from <HI>Persia,</HI> both destroyed their

<P>Passing through the South-gate of this City, we paid to the Porter of the gate a Shaughee vpon a beast, descending from the City into a most fertile and fruitfull plaine, where are many Gardens and Orchards, and places of great re|freshment.</P>
<P>Through this plaine runneth the great Riuer <HI>Euphrates,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Euphrates.</NOTE> with a very swift current; and is as broade here sometimes of the yeare as the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>London</HI> Bridge, but now was much dryed vp, by reason of the heate in Sommer, making thereby many Ilands and demi-Ilands, where the Citizens of <HI>Caraemit</HI> during the Sommer season doe vse to pitch their Tents, to enioy the freshment of the aire and riuer: but in the Winter it swelleth so abundantly ouer the said Ilands and bankes, that neither man nor beast is able to passe ouer: to auoide which inconuenience, there is a mile distant from the city a stone bridge of twenty arches, made ouer the said Riuer.

<P>AT our first entrance into this Countrey, we trauelled through a goodly, large, and spacious plaine, com|passed about with a row of high mountaines, where were many Villages, wholly inhabited by <HI>Armenians</HI>; a people very industrious in all kinde of labour: their women very skilfull and actiue in shooting, and managing any sort of weapon, like the fierce <HI>Amazones</HI> in antique time; and the women at this day, which inhabit the mountaine <HI>Xatach</HI> in <HI>Persia.</HI> Their families are very great; for, both Sonnes, Nephewes, and Nieces doe dwell vnder one roofe, hauing all their substance in common: and when the father dyeth, the eldest Sonne doth gouerne the rest, all submit|ting themselues vnder his regiment. But when the eldest Sonne dyeth, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> gouernment doth not passe to his sonnes, but to the eldest brother. And if it chance to fall out, that all the brethren doe die, then the gouernment doth belong to the eldest Sonne of the eldest brother, and so from one to another.

the poore <HI>Armenians</HI> to liue amongst them. But the true reason is, for that they are very laborious in transporting merchandise from one City to another, by which meanes through the customes which are paid in euery City, the coffers of the <HI>Grand Signior</HI> are wonderfully inriched. Vn|to which doth well agree that scoffing taunt which <HI>Abbas</HI> now King of <HI>Persia</HI> did throw vpon an <HI>Armenian,</HI> who being desirous to forsake his Christian faith, and to em|brace the wicked and filthy superstition of the <HI>Persians,</HI> vp|pon hope of reward and preferment, the King did not on|ly rebuke his tepedity and coldnesse in his religion, but sent him away with this skornefull reproofe: That an <HI>Armeni|an</HI> now was good for nought, saue as a Camel to transport merchandise from one city to another: implying that how|s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">euer in antique times they had beene warlike and cou|ragious, yet now they were become <HI>Buffelloes</HI> and <HI>Pul|trones,</HI> altogether vnfit for martiall affaires.</P>

They imitate the <HI>Dioscorians</HI> in eating whit-meats on Saturday, which to doe on Wednesday and Friday were a deadly sin: neuerthelesse they will not refraine from the eating of flesh on euery Friday, betweene the feast of the Passeouer and the Ascention. They abstaine fiue Sabboths in the yeare from eating flesh, in remembrance of that time, in which the Gentiles did sacrifice their children vnto Idols. They celebrate the Annunciation of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> on the sixt of Aprill, the Natiuity of our blessed Sauiour on the sixt of Ianuary, the Purification the fourth of February, and the Transfiguration the fourteenth of August. The mi|nistration of their Liturgie or seruice, is performed in their natiue language, that all may vnderstand: but in their ser|uice of the Masse for the dead, they are most idolatrous, v|sing at the solemnizing thereof, to sacrifice a Lambe, which they first lead round about the Church, and after they haue killed it and rosted it, they spread it on a faire white linnen cloath, the Priest giuing to each of the Congregation a part and portion thereof.

This Citie is seated in a goodly fertile plaine of three or foure daies iourney in length, furnished with two thousand villages, to serue the necessary vses thereof: but euill builded, &amp; for the most part all of bricks not hardened with fire, but onely dried in the Sunne; as are most parts of the buildings of all <HI>Persia.</HI></P>

<P>There are three places in the Citie most of note: <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Kings Pallace,</HI> the <HI>Bassars,</HI> and the <HI>At-Maidan.</HI> The gate of the kings Pallace is built with stone of diuers colours, and verie curiously ennameled with gold: on the seeling within, is carued the warres of the <HI>Persian</HI> Kings, and the sundrie battels sought by them against the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tar|tars</HI>; the pauements of the roomes beneath, and chambers aboue are spread with most fine carpets, wouen and tessu|ted with silke and gold, all ensignes and monuments of the <HI>Persian</HI> greatnesse.</P>
