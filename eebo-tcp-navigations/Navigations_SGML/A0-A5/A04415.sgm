<HEAD>A RELATION OF the late Iourney of the Ie&s;uits bani&s;hed out of the Kingdomes of <HI>Bohemia, and Hungaria.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_FAme (as I &s;uppo&s;e) hath &s;uffi|ciently declared how all the <HI>Ie&s;uits</HI> were &s;ent and bani|&s;hed out of the Kingdomes of <HI>Bohemia</HI> and <HI>Hungaria,</HI> that they might neuer at|tempt to come againe into tho&s;e Kingdomes hereafter: and this bani&s;hment of theirs was after this maner, that if any of tho&s;e <HI>Ie&s;uits</HI> be found in the two fore|&s;aid Kingdomes, where&s;oeuer, with whom &s;oeuer, of what condition &s;oeuer he be; and vnder what pretence &s;oeuer; according to the definition of the Statutes of either Kingdome, he &s;hould pay the iu&s;t reward of his fact. The poore wretches are exclu|ced, that neither interce&s;&s;ion, nor any way deui&s;ed by art or friend &s;hould preuaile to bring them in againe for euer. Now I come to their going out, why doe they goe? Being once con&s;trained to de|part; they went away willingly, <HI>bona voluntas non e&s;t agitanda calcaribus,</HI> a willing mind needs not the &s;pur. Con&s;trained &s;ay you? namely, they would
<PB N="2" REF="3"> depart for the time of anger willingly. This ba|ni&s;hment and ca&s;ting forth of them, although it brought exceeding much greefe and &s;orrow to their whole Society, euen as that &s;ame Bore &s;ent by <HI>Diana</HI> into the corne of <HI>Callidonia:</HI> yet did it not altogether ca&s;t away the &s;peare, but rather fol|lowed that &s;ame mo&s;t Godly &s;entence, <HI>(when they &s;hall per&s;ecute you in that City, fly into another.)</HI> But who doe you aske? this was their recreation where|by the&s;e wretched &s;tudents di&s;tingui&s;hed the inter|mi&s;&s;ions of their &s;tudies.</P>
<P>They doe too too much earne&s;tly thinke that they are to &s;earch into the&s;e cares, where they may recouer a &s;ecure, and (as I may &s;ay) a healthfull place; &s;uch as they had left at <HI>Bohemia</HI> and <HI>Hun|garia:</HI> and &s;ee, the euent was contrary to their pur|po&s;es.</P>
<P>While they went thither in this <HI>Bohemian. Hungarian</HI> bani&s;hment, that at length they might embrace faire <HI>Germanie,</HI> they come, they &s;ee, they &s;alute their fellowes and bretheren. O <HI>Germanie,</HI> how great a wonder wert thou to the&s;e bani&s;hed men at there fir&s;t entrance, how didde&s;t thou yeeld an allurement to tho&s;e greedy eies! they &s;ee the goodne&s;&s;e of the land: it is mo&s;t wonderfull and remote from all danger: they &s;ee the temper of the aire; it is mo&s;t whole&s;ome. There is all &s;ound and perpetuall healthfulne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>What &s;hould I &s;peake of the flori&s;hing fields, the high hills, and the vnhurtfull cha&s;es? I will not
<PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y"> &s;peake of the little brookes &s;liding with a plea|&s;ant brinke, and the &s;tately kinds of woods and groues. The&s;e, the&s;e &s;eemed to the Fathers the <HI>Ie|&s;uites</HI> mo&s;t full of a plea&s;ant &s;weetne&s;&s;e: the very midnight, which is wont to bee plea&s;ant to all, they made vnquiet to them&s;elues. And what would it bee (&s;ay they) if &s;o pretious fleeces of &s;heepe, &s;o many fertill Cities, villages and mona|&s;teries; and &s;o good great a plenty of corne, oliues, and vine-yards &s;hould appertaine vnto vs? Oh brethren, let vs make tryall, let vs v&s;e our be&s;t cun|ning: that wee may be receiued fir&s;t in <HI>Germanie:</HI> afterwards that wee may become Lords of it. Be|hold &ocirc; <HI>Germany,</HI> how thou &s;trike&s;t without a brui&s;e, how thou wounde&s;t without blood! how quickly and louingly thou doe&s;t drinke to the&s;e Fathers the cups of their de&s;ire and wi&s;h! how thou &s;mi|le&s;t on them! O brethren, the&s;e men about to touch the matter to the quicke, doe put on them (as they are wont,) the prepuce of impudency; they &s;olicite faire <HI>Germany</HI> with earne&s;t and daily intreaty; that it would afford them a mo&s;t &s;afe defence again&s;t the&s;e clouds of bani&s;hment.</P>
<P>They cry out, thou &ocirc; <HI>Germany</HI> art the onely an|chor, which art able to pre&s;erue this company, to cha&s;e away &s;tormes among&s;t the waues and tem|pe&s;ts. <HI>India</HI> would mo&s;t bountifully defend vs; neither would <HI>Italy</HI> deny vs any thing: but it is an exceeding long iourny thither; here the aire is mo&s;t dangerous, that which way &s;oeuer we turne
<PB N="4" REF="4"> vs, an exceeding great burthen of this difficulty is laid vpon vs.</P>
<P>We haue no &s;mall cau&s;e to re&s;ide el&s;ewhere: but now &s;eeing our pa&s;&s;ing ouer hath a little ta&s;ted of this land (in which the&s;e that are addicted to our fellow&s;hip doe not liue in want) we conclude, that this thing is not done without the diuine proui|dence. Al&s;o this <HI>Germany</HI> being better knowne through a proce&s;&s;e of time, hath de&s;erued to be a longer time loued of vs; and is accounted worthy to be adorned with the garland of our piety, and mo&s;t faithfull in&s;tructing. Walke ouer and ouer it. O <HI>Germany,</HI> what is it, that our &s;o many com|panies doe watch in thy townes and hou&s;es for thy &s;afety? other lands being let goe, wee de&s;ire thy helping hand, &ocirc; <HI>Germany</HI> (&s;ay they.) Let the holy Scripture moue thee; <HI>Succour the needy:</HI> Let it mooue thee, that thou mai&s;t follow mercy; <HI>excer|ci&s;e mercy.</HI> Neither doe we reque&s;t any great mat|ters, nor things too high, onely &s;ome mona&s;teries in which we may haue meate, drinke, and apparrell. In the&s;e mona&s;teries we will liue religiou&s;ly; we will &s;hew our deuotion and loue towards <HI>Germany;</HI> and al&s;o our e&s;peciall care in in&s;tructing youth. And we, and others with vs &s;hall fly with the&s;e winges, and &s;hall exceed all humane matters. In the meane time although our innocency &s;hall bring vs into a narrower roome and fame, yet &s;hall it fly a|gaine through all the coa&s;ts of <HI>Germany;</HI> and &s;taine <HI>Bohemia</HI> and <HI>Hungary,</HI> vnle&s;&s;e they become better.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4" MS="y">
<P>Of which their wonderfull faire per&s;wa&s;ion after that the brethren had made an end; the Lords the Delegates of <HI>Garmany</HI> not long meditating, at la&s;t doe an&s;wer thus. Neither doe they di&s;&s;emble that they al&s;o are &s;tirred and heated with that &s;ame vn|timely heat. We haue beene very attentiue to your reque&s;t (o Fathers): Al&s;o we haue attentiuely heard (as is fitting) your cau&s;es and rea&s;ons, prouoking vs to prouide you &s;ettled places among&s;t vs, which truely haue beene acceptable to vs. Wee would that our an&s;were to you be plaine and without co|lour. For that you extoll our beautifull Country, <HI>Germany,</HI> with all kind of pray&s;es, we doe take it ac|ceptably: onely this wee di&s;like, that you de&s;ire to re&s;t with vs in this bo&s;ome which is proper and be|longing to ours. And truely we do very much won|der, that you do not &s;eeke out and de&s;ire other pla|ces fuller of our miracles. For although the ayre might be mo&s;t dangerous in <HI>Italy,</HI> by your &s;aying, perhaps it might bee more temperate in <HI>Spaine,</HI> where there be more of your companies; and more of your brethren. Yea there you haue your <HI>Meca|nas</HI> him&s;elfe, who as a <HI>Minerua</HI> doth pre&s;erue you on water, and as an <HI>Vli&s;&s;es</HI> doth defend you being in danger of life.</P>
<P>Doe you &s;ay that the iourney into <HI>India</HI> is too long? It is &s;horter into <HI>France,</HI> where (if your apo|logy may bee beleeued) your companions are of late preferred with new priuiledges. If you haue there &s;o good opportunities, why doe you &s;triue to
<PB N="6" REF="5"> forgoe them? Doe you &s;ay it will be good for vs, hurtfull to you, to profit vs by your piety and in|formation in our &s;tudies? It is not expedient for you (&ocirc; Fathers) if yee determine any thing to bee done of you in our right. And if we be not decei|ued, <HI>Germany</HI> hath more certaine a&s;&s;ertions of li|berty to thinke well, then <HI>Trecen&s;is</HI> heretofore in <HI>France</HI> (which is commonly called <HI>Troy.</HI>)</P>
<P>But we doe exceedingly maruell what the cau&s;e &s;hould be, why in &s;o &s;hort a time ye &s;hould bee ca&s;t out of &s;o many &s;tately common-wealths and King|domes? Truely all their fields are large bookes, which we cannot thru&s;t vpon you by turning them, but for conference &s;ake onely &s;hew them as true to the whole world, and of you as yet not refuted We de&s;ire that &s;ome of you would behold your acts done in <HI>England: Certainly the acts of</HI> Garnet <HI>and of all of you would breath out &s;ome other thing then Innocency:</HI> namely, trea&s;on, and innouation, of which you were all guilty.</P>
<P>This one thing you obiect, (&ocirc; Fathers) but know this, a deepe wound retaines a &s;carce: Yee did not bid farewell to the <HI>Venetians</HI> again&s;t your wills; but perhaps vncon&s;trained.</P>
<P>You had neuer gone away by the decree of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Lords, had not the commandement of <HI>Paul</HI> the fifth Pope cau&s;ed you, to whom being the head of the Church, you yeelded all humble obe|dience with due ob&s;eruance: and in this intermi&s;&s;i|on from Religion you adored his Surplice: <HI>So obe|dience
<PB N="7" REF="5" MS="y"> alone is the vertue which worketh the other vertues in the minde: and what were it of ye &s;hould call him Lord, Lord, and would not doe what he &s;aith?</HI> Ah how impatient were the <HI>Venetian</HI> Lords of your departure? How willingly would they haue detai|ned you longer, if good words, honours, if more|ouer new priuiledges could haue preuailed any thing.</P>
<P>But in &s;ayling we mu&s;t giue eare to our Pilot, in warre to our Captaine: <HI>So that fidelity due to the Pope by the Venetian title hath made you wretched men bani&s;hed.</HI> It is written: <HI>He that beleeueth &s;hall be &s;aued.</HI></P>
<P>We now talke alone (&ocirc; Fathers Ie&s;uits) and are weakned: we could wi&s;h that a <HI>Venetian</HI> were here who might affirme the&s;e things.</P>
<P>We do adde nothing heere but what your &s;elues had in your Apology: that the will of God may be done, who is the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; from whom as you expect &s;aluation, &s;o al|&s;o expect iu&s;t iudgement. We do willingly pa&s;&s;e ouer with &s;ilence the <HI>Belgicke</HI> fame, declaring what reproachfull things, contentions and wicked deeds you haue there committed: If in others there bee any di&s;grace and wickedne&s;&s;e, in you it is pray&s;e and comeline&s;&s;e (as it is in your Apology.)</P>
<P>We know not what to &s;ay, onely this wee hold, that God liueth, who cau&s;eth his Sunne to &s;hine vpon the good and bad, and raineth vpon the iu&s;t and vniu&s;t, and will reward euery one according to
<PB N="8" REF="6"> his workes: VVe do al&s;o willingly pa&s;&s;e ouer, why wee &s;aw your hone&s;t company bani&s;hed out of <HI>France</HI> for their faults: wee are full of writings to this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>In briefe, ye are accu&s;ed of trea&s;on and &s;laughter intended again&s;t Kings: who&s;e life and blood how you laid in waite for, would haue beene manife&s;t (more cleare then the noon day) had not that &s;ame <HI>Carmelitane</HI> worke couered it vpon your Martyrs. Hereupon a Catholike within the&s;e three yeares (if I be not deceiued) obiected fairly vnto you that you teach and write commonly, that any man of what condition &s;oeuer hee bee, may and ought to kill or &s;lay a King (&s;uppo&s;e any King you will) for a certaine &s;tipend or pen&s;ion of mony, if hee bee a Tyrant, or di&s;obedient to your will and &s;ayings.</P>
<P>This is your practi&s;e whereby you preuaile much with bad men: whereupon you de&s;eruedly wor&s;hip <HI>Henry Garnet,</HI> as a Martyr for that his wicked and &s;auage deed, who for it was executed in Eng|land.</P>
<P>VVee ingeniou&s;ly confe&s;&s;e that which is proper to all <HI>Garmans,</HI> that our Gallowes, Iibbets, pri&s;ons and all in&s;truments of torture, are full of &s;uch Mar|tyrs.</P>
<P>Let vs not cheri&s;h a thought of the feyned and lying miracles of &s;uch mo&s;t fal&s;e martyrs. We do euen tremble (as God &s;hall help vs) that the Catho|lique religion &s;hould couer &s;uch Barbarous, Sa|uage, and mo&s;t diuelli&s;h facts; and that it can call
<PB N="9" REF="6" MS="y"> and wor&s;hip &s;uch wicked and filthy men as Saints. So much euill was religion able to per&s;wade. Nei|ther were the winds the cau&s;e of their expul&s;ion out of tho&s;e mo&s;t famous Cities of <HI>Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Bohe|mia,</HI> (we will not &s;peake of <HI>Polonia,</HI> and <HI>Swetia:</HI>) The&s;e things &s;hall neuer be forgotten, &s;o long as that winged charriot of Fame &s;hall pa&s;&s;e through countries and ages. Yea haue beene &s;hunners of peace and concord: yea haue brought in di&s;&s;en&s;i|ons, braules, and treacheries into the&s;e kingdomes. All the&s;e you doe vnder colour of religion; as that your practi&s;e wrought by mo&s;t fraudulent wiles, and mo&s;t wicked attempts doth witne&s;&s;e. This is it by which you wring your &s;elues into high places; you flatter the eares of the chiefe&s;t men; being mo&s;t skilfull in that matter: And &s;o you couer your indirect going and &s;itting among&s;t the&s;e Peeres with the mantle of religion and piety (with a mi&s;|chiefe.) We al&s;o vnder&s;tand (&ocirc; fathers vnle&s;&s;e you haue &s;ome other religion then the Catholike) that you al&s;o, after your manner doe attempt the &s;ame: iu&s;t after the manner of Sorcere&s;&s;es; which while they can doe no harme to others, doe hurt them|&s;elues.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the&s;e excellent E&s;tates of Common|wealths, you bring in al&s;o an innouation: where tho&s;e &s;ame good Catholiques are Athei&s;ts, Liber|tines, and &s;imple men, they are commonly called: yee doe all for this end, that treacheries and braw|lings might be brought in, whereby you might fi&s;h
<PB N="10" REF="7"> in &s;afety for your company. And truly, not the <HI>Bohemians,</HI> and <HI>Hungarians</HI> onely, but euen your Catholikes, from el&s;ewhere doe obiect the fame things vnto you. Where we certainly &s;uppo&s;e this to be in the better part of you; grant vs &ocirc; Lord to &s;peake forth peace in our times: All the turmoiles which you cau&s;e (your accu&s;ers alleadge) are made for religions &s;ake (vnder this colour you affect your monarchy among&s;t the Catholikes;) yet not|with&s;tanding they mu&s;t not be &s;aid to be vnderta|ken of the profe&s;&s;ors of the Go&s;pell at any time, for the cau&s;e of religion: O mi&s;ery; we &s;uffer not our ci&s;terns to be drawne for all, whom we vnder&s;tand you runne into.</P>
<P>For to what end is that plenty? But aboue all we &s;et before vs the pre&s;ent e&s;tate onely of the <HI>Bohe|mians.</HI> The &s;educers of the common people, &s;ay, that here is no talking of religion: &ocirc; blindne&s;&s;e! Let them beleeue that will; they &s;hall finde to their owne co&s;t, that religion is our beginning, midde&s;t, and end: by which all things done, or to be done, are ruled; or rather in which they are all contained, your following, &s;euere, and har&s;h proceedings with <HI>Clo&s;targrab</HI> and <HI>Braunaro</HI> &s;hall afford you one liuely example of &s;ixe hundred.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Emperour <HI>Matthias</HI> wrote very pre|ci&s;ely in his late letters to the Earle of <HI>Bucquoy;</HI> Thou &s;halt de&s;erue excellently well of vs, of out Princely hou&s;e, of religion, and of the Common-weale; if thou woulde&s;t admit of this religion,
<PB N="11" REF="7" MS="y"> &ocirc; <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and woulde&s;t entertaine friend&s;hip with the <HI>Ie&s;uites,</HI> thou coulde&s;t not haue warre: The <HI>Pope</HI> would ble&s;&s;e thee; the <HI>Spaniard</HI> would &s;alute thee, and all the whole Clergy would vi&s;ite thee. But all the&s;e things &ocirc; Fathers, are vaine; vnle&s;&s;e more weighty matters be behind. For yee pro|claime and condemne all for Heretiks, which doe not obey the <HI>Romane</HI> Church, and yee teach open|ly that no credit is to be giuen to them. In the meane time yee &s;tirre vp the Peeres of this Realme one again&s;t another by your diuers waies and de|ui&s;es: yee &s;ow di&s;cord betweene the magi&s;trates and the &s;ubiects; and by your vn&s;peakeable &s;ub|tilty yee cau&s;e variances in this Empire. By which your deceiptfull &s;tratagem yee haue &s;hewed your companions to be mo&s;t deceiptfull; that your pro|mi&s;es are e&s;teemed as rotten nuts; yea a ru&s;ticke hone&s;ty is better than this your learned malice.</P>
<P>You promi&s;e all things vpon oath, but in the end you keepe none. And good rea&s;on: for what religion doth bind them to the law, whom their owne religion and the <HI>Popes</HI> Bull doe free from all bonds of Law? You make a politike mixture of tho&s;e things which belong to the honour of God and his word, by &s;aying; As though con&s;cience were not &s;o much to bee kept in politicke matters. Doe not we know the&s;e things (good men) we do altogether thinke with him, That there is no greater deceipt in all iniu&s;tice then is in them, who then, when they mo&s;t deceiue,
<PB N="12" REF="8"> doe it, that they may &s;eeme to be good men. And truly, they &s;eeme mo&s;t &s;trange to vs enquiring, why faith among&s;t the Ie&s;uits &s;hould want followers: Afterward it was told vs that it was prouided a|mong&s;t you long agoe by a &s;peciall edict, that any man may prouide for other good men by his la&s;t will; that faith cannot be &s;aid hereditary. All the true profe&s;&s;ours of the Go&s;pell in the Sacred <HI>Ro|mane</HI> Empire &s;hall for euer endanger their liues and &s;afety vnle&s;&s;e they be carefull, prouident, and watchfull in the&s;e and &s;uch like matters. Good God, was it po&s;&s;ible that the&s;e things &s;hould come to our cares?</P>
<P>Beleeue it (&ocirc; Fathers) euen your in&s;truments and meanes by which you doe the&s;e things; much more your wicked deeds them&s;elues are knowne to vs.</P>
<P>You haue Sermons; this is a great matter; which like a canker &s;pread abroad: by which al&s;o you ayme at the end of the Oratour, which is, to per|&s;wade, and draw others into his owne opinion. To the&s;e are added your actions and mo&s;t &s;trange va|riations in your behauiours and carriages, by which you allure the wayward common people; which do become the &s;eller of victuals a iuggler or baud, beter then they become a Pulpet. As the Trecen|&s;ian iudgement in <HI>France</HI> is of Father <HI>Binet.</HI></P>
<P>Neither haue you Sermons onely (&ocirc; Fathers) but confe&s;&s;ions al&s;o, this is greater: by the&s;e the condition of euery priuate hou&s;e, and of the
<PB N="13" REF="8" MS="y"> goodmen of the hou&s;es, the &s;ecrets of the whole common-wealth or Kingdome, where you liue; yea the &s;ecrets of the Romane Empire and their neigh|bours are knowne to you. By the&s;e (we &s;ay againe) you de&s;eruedly domineere ouer the con&s;ciences of men, and by compelling whom you will to vnlaw|full things, you moderate all things by your owne rea&s;on: becau&s;e it is written: VVho&s;e &s;innes you &s;hall remit, they are remitted; and who&s;e &s;innes you retaine, they are retained.</P>
<P>By this place iniu&s;t contracts are made with you, commandements, or wicked and turbulent coun|&s;ailes are inioyned with a gentle buzzing, things iniu&s;tly gotten are kept &s;till: loues and vnlawfull mariages are not onely not broken off, but often|times are contracted: In a word, the court is kept here.</P>
<P>To the&s;e truely (that I may &s;peake with you) pe|netent men may bee compelled by the prie&s;t. For neither was power granted in vaine to the Apo&s;tles and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors by Chri&s;t, as well to binde as to loo&s;e.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, (&ocirc; Fathers) this is your chiefe&s;t deuice: you haue two &s;orts of di&s;ciples here; all for your owne v&s;e and profit: one of them, murtherers of heretique Kings and Peeres, as you call them. whom you neuer cea&s;e to incen&s;e and animate with all diligence and care, as al&s;o with promi&s;es of get|ting perpetuall glory, and of e&s;caping Purgatory. Who can here re&s;i&s;t &s;o many armed men?</P>
<PB N="14" REF="9">
<P>The other &s;ort of your di&s;ciples are the &s;onnes of great men, whom while you teach &s;o, that when the perfection of wit in them &s;hall come at length to the top and height of knowledge, you &s;o binde vnto you, together with their parents, that you may haue &s;ufficient by the helpe of the&s;e, wherewithall you may liue, and encrea&s;e your companies and religion. You in&s;till Logike and Rhetorike into them, that they may be Sophi&s;ters. This, that they may defend any doubt, per&s;wade fal&s;e things, and open the doores to your companions among&s;t all men. There the truth is ouerwhelmed with deceiptfull di&s;tinctions &s;ophi&s;tications, equi|uocations, and mentall eua&s;ions; here it is ouer|whelmed with a trimne&s;&s;e of words, and with a <HI>Ciceronean</HI> eloquence. <HI>And I gaue my heart</HI> (&s;aith the Preacher) <HI>that I might know Wi&s;dome and Lear|ning, and my Errours and folly.</HI></P>
