<P>_AMong&s;t all the infinite ble&s;&s;ings wherewith it hath plea&s;ed the Di|uine Goodne&s;&s;e to cloath and adorne our Nation: None is more remarkeable or glorious, then this happie and long wi&s;ht

<P>To proceed then to tho&s;e Royall Pa&s;|&s;ages and triumphant Ceremonies which were performed at the&s;e great Nuptials. It is to be vnder&s;tood that vpon Thur&s;|day, being the eight of May, according to the <HI>French</HI> Computation, but the eight and twentieth of Aprill, according to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> account, the mo&s;t <HI>Christian King</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> with his Queene, and
<PB N="3" REF="3"> the Prince his onely Brother, and atten|ded by my Lords the Dukes of <HI>Nemeurs</HI> and <HI>Elbeuf,</HI> the two great Mar&s;halls of <HI>France, Moun&s;ieur de Vitry</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;&s;om|piere,</HI> With a world of other Noble-men, Ladies, Knights and Gentlemen, came forth of his Bed-chamber or Cabinet, in|to the publique Pre&s;ence Chamber, where he &s;ent for the mo&s;t Excellent Lady his Si&s;ter, who with all Solemnitie was pre|&s;ently brought forth by the Queene her Mother, and attended on by the Prince&s;&s;e of <HI>Conde,</HI> the Prince&s;&s;e of <HI>Countee,</HI> the Dutche&s;&s;e of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> the Dutche&s;&s;e of <HI>Cheureu&s;e,</HI> and the Dutche&s;&s;e of <HI>Elbeuf,</HI> and diuers other Ladies of State, and Maides of Honour: Her garments that day were exceeding rich and &s;umptuous, her Gowne being of cloth of gold, cut vpon cloth of &s;iluer, and richly embrode|red all ouer with <HI>Flower de Luces</HI> of gold, and cha&s;ed and interlaid with Dimonds, Rubies, Pearle, and other rich Iuelrie of an ine&s;timable valew: Her Traine was
<PB N="4" REF="4"> borne vp by the young Lady of <HI>Burbon,</HI> her deare Kin&s;woman, and a Ladie of ex|ceeding great beautie and wonderfull ad|miration.</P>
<P>After the Prince&s;&s;e had in reuerend and &s;olemne wi&s;e done obey&s;ance to the King her Brother, in which action of hu|militie a man might haue beheld all the glorious beames of Maie&s;tie and &s;weet|ne&s;&s;e: there pre&s;ently entred into the Chamber the Earle of <HI>Carlile,</HI> and the Earle of <HI>Holland,</HI> being both Amba&s;&s;adors for his Maie&s;tie of Great <HI>Britaine;</HI> and both &s;o rich and &s;umptuou&s;ly attired, that neither art nor wealth was able to exceed them. The&s;e two noble men in a mo&s;t &s;olemne and re&s;pectiue manner Deliue|red to the King of <HI>France</HI> the Contract of Mariage, which was forthwith opened and publikely read by the Secretary of the Kings Cabinet in an high and audible voice, and then all other Couenants and agreements concluded vpon, the Con|tract was allowed and ratified by the
<PB N="5" REF="4"> Lord Chancellour, who made a congra|tulatory &s;peech in honour of that daies Ceremonie.</P>
<P>A&s;&s;oone as the&s;e things were perfor|med, the two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors with|drew them&s;elues into the Duke of <HI>Cheu|reu&s;e</HI> Chamber which was the Kings lodgings, when all accommodations ne|ce&s;&s;ary for them and that daies &s;olemnitie was in goodly order prepared, here the Emba&s;&s;adours communicated vnto the Duke the Contract, who forthwith re|turned againe to the King his Ma&s;ter, hauing the Emba&s;&s;adours al&s;o with him, and diuers other Noblemen of great ranke and place. The Duke was al&s;o him&s;elfe mo&s;t richly attired, and though the ground was blacke, yet was the im|brodery of admirable value, and abun|dance of Diamonds and other Precious &s;tones be&s;towed within the &s;ame, but e&s;|pecially vpon the panes of his breeches and the tagges of his points, which were prai&s;ed at an infinite world of trea&s;ure.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="5">
<P>A&s;&s;oone as the Duke was come before the King (after &s;olemne reuerence done) hee pre&s;ented to his Highne&s;&s;e his pro|curation, and &s;hewed the authoritie and Commi&s;&s;ion which the King of great <HI>Britaine</HI> had giuen him, being in a certaine &s;cedule annexed and fixt vnto the Contract, which after the King had read, hee allowed and &s;igned al&s;o: &s;o did the great Lady her &s;elfe the Queene of <HI>France,</HI> and the Queene Mother, the Duke of <HI>Cheuru&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> to whom the proxey belonged, and both the Emba&s;&s;adours for <HI>England;</HI> then all things being brought to this perfection, the Cardi|nall <HI>de la Roche Faucault</HI> attyred in all his pontificall roabes, after the cu&s;tome and manner of the <HI>French</HI> Nation perfor|med the Contract and publi&s;hed the af|fiance in a mo&s;t &s;tately and reuerend manner, to the infinite ioy and con|tentment of all the beholders, and the vn&s;peakeable comfort and pro&s;perity of both the happy Kingdomes.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="5">
<P>This Contract thus happily perfor|med in the Kings Pallace of the <HI>Louure,</HI> forthwith our Ladies Church in <HI>Paris</HI> is cho&s;en for the Celebration and finall conclu&s;ion of the euer-happy mariage; and that it might bee the fitter for the receipt of &s;o great a pompe and &s;tate, it was out of hand hang'd all ouer with wonderfull rich Arras, cloth of Ti&s;&s;ue, cloth of Gold, and cloth of Siluer; there was al&s;o in the &s;ame Church rai&s;ed vp vpon goodly pilla&s;ters and gilt co|lumbs a mo&s;t rich and &s;tately gallery or Scaffold of &s;tate, which extended from the fir&s;t entry of the Archbi&s;hops hou&s;e to the very Quire or vppermo&s;t end of the &s;ame Church, being a &s;tructure of &s;uch good liues, that art could not po&s;&s;ible expre&s;&s;e any thing beyond it. The Pil|lars and railes which did vnderprop this gallery were at the top couered with a very curious Purple or Violet coloured Sattin, all imbrodered and powdred ouer with golden Flower de Luces, and at the
<PB N="8" REF="6"> bottomes they were ouer&s;pread with ve|ry fine white linnen and many burning tapers of waxe flaming about the &s;ame, &s;o that the Church &s;eemed like the Pal|lace of the Sunne, de&s;cribed by <HI>Ouid</HI> in his &s;econd Booke of the tran&s;mutations of &s;hapes.</P>
<P>Through this Gallery the whole pompe and body of this Royall and vn|matchable &s;olemnity was to pa&s;&s;e, which I haue thought good briefely to &s;et downe as I receiued it from tho&s;e which were Noble eye witne&s;&s;es of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the perfixed day and houre for the &s;olemnitie of this Royall and &s;acred Mariage being come, and the whole pompe thereof in a full readine&s;&s;e, the fir&s;t that marched forth were the hun|dred Swi&s;&s;ers of the Kings Guard all cloa|thed in the Kings liuery of e&s;tate with their Drummes beating before and after them, the Fifes whi&s;tling, their En&s;igne di&s;played, and all other things &s;utable to
<PB N="9" REF="6"> a warlike preparation, for the&s;e are the Kings fir&s;t, and indeede mo&s;t &s;ouldier-like guard, being men of that temper and condition, that they are truely &s;aid to be borne Souldiers, liue Souldiers, and dye Souldiers. A good pretty &s;pace af|ter them went twelue Hoboyes in the Kings liuery of E&s;tate al&s;o, who playing vpon tho&s;e loud In&s;truments &s;trucke in|to &s;ome admiration, but into all delight and plea&s;ure. Next vnto the&s;e marcht in two ranckes eight of the Kings principall Drummes in their Liueries of E&s;tate al&s;o, and the&s;e were &s;aid to beat their Drums with that brauery and couragiou&s;ne&s;&s;e, that as it was &s;aid of <HI>Alexander,</HI> that when he heard Ionicke mu&s;icke, he would &s;tart vp, call for his &s;word and armour, and expre&s;&s;e all the pa&s;&s;ions of anger and fu|rie, &s;o there was not an eare that heard the&s;e, but awaked the heart to thinke of heroycall atchieuements. After the&s;e marched the Kings &s;econd Guard, con&s;i|&s;ting of Frenchmen: Then came at lea&s;t a
<PB N="10" REF="7"> dozen Trumpets in their Liueries of E|&s;tate al&s;o, with rich Banners containing the Kings full Coat Armour, and faire Cordans of watchet &s;ilke and gold &s;uta|ble to the re&s;t in euery proportion. After the&s;e Trumpets came in a &s;tately manner <HI>Moun&s;ieur de Rhodes,</HI> who is the great Ma|&s;ter of the Ceremonies, being wonderful|ly richly apparrelled, and at the lea&s;t twen|tie of the Kings ordinary Gentlemen at|tending about him. Immediately after him went all the Lords, and others who were Knights of the great and renowned Order of the Holy Gho&s;t, in the rich Roabs of their Order, and with their Palkes or Mantles of watchet veluet all, mo&s;t brauely embrodered with <HI>Flower de Luces</HI> of gold, and their other garments &s;hining with pretious &s;tones and rich Iuel|rie. Neare vnto the&s;e Knights went &s;e|uen Heralds at Armes in very rich Coats of Crim&s;on Veluet, with the Armes of <HI>France,</HI> and all powdred ouer with gol|den <HI>Flower de Luces.</HI> Clo&s;e vnto the&s;e
<PB N="11" REF="7"> Heraulds followed the two great great Mar&s;halls of <HI>France, Moun&s;ieur de Vitry,</HI> and <HI>Moun&s;ieur Ba&s;&s;ompiere;</HI> and after them came alone the Duke of <HI>Elbeuf</HI> in mo&s;t &s;umptuous attire. Then a little di|&s;tance from him came (repre&s;enting the Per&s;on of the Royall Bride-groome) the Duke of <HI>Cheureu&s;e,</HI> in a &s;ute of mo&s;t rich perfumed blackecloth, cut vpon cloth of gold, and lined with rich Ti&s;&s;ue; vpon his head he wore a Cap of cloth of gold, on which was fixed a Iewell of a mo&s;t in|e&s;timable value, euery Diamond being &s;o glorious, that it dazelled the eyes of all that gazed vpon it; about his body Bau|tricke-wi&s;e he wore a wonderfull curious rich Scarffe, all embrodered ouer with Ro|&s;es, and powdred with Paragon Dia|monds, and great orient Pearle; he wore a &s;hort cloake all embrodered ouer with gold, and &s;et with Diamonds &s;o wonder|full thicke and furiou&s;ly, that in his mo|uing hee &s;eemed to burne and beare a li|uing flame about him. After him came
<PB N="12" REF="8"> the Earle of <HI>Carlile,</HI> and the Earle of <HI>Hol|land</HI> (being the Extraordinary Emba&s;&s;a|dors for the Maie&s;tie of Great <HI>Britaine</HI>) and they were both apparrelled in white cloth of &s;iluer, richly embrodered and in|tercha&s;ed with many pretious &s;tones and wealthie Iuelry. Then came the King of <HI>France</HI> in his owne Per&s;on, in Royall garments of E&s;tate, all embrodered ouer with gold and &s;iluer, and almo&s;t couered ouer with rich Iewels, in his right hand holding the mo&s;t Excellent Prince&s;&s;e his &s;i&s;ter, who that day wore a Crowne of gold vpon her head, cha&s;ed and &s;et with Diamonds, and a world of other pretious &s;tones, her Gowne was all powdred ouer with golden <HI>Flower de Luces:</HI> and on her other hand went <HI>Moun&s;ieur</HI> the Kings Brother, wonderfull &s;umptuou&s;ly attired, and not inferiour to any that hac place in the Royall a&s;&s;embly. Next vnto the King, Prince, and Royall Bride, followed the Queen Mother of <HI>France,</HI> very graue, yet richly attired: and after her came the
<PB N="13" REF="8"> Queene of <HI>France,</HI> who&s;e Gowne was all lulyeoly, embrodered ouer with gold and &s;iluer, and &s;et, and incha&s;ed with a world of pretious &s;tones, Pearle, and o|ther Iuelry; the Prince&s;&s;e of <HI>Conde,</HI> and the Prince&s;&s;e of <HI>Countee</HI> bore vp the Queenes long Traine. And after them followed the young Ladie of <HI>Montpen&s;ier,</HI> and the Counte&s;&s;e of <HI>Soy&s;ons,</HI> and other Ladies of the Kings bloud, in rich gownes brodered about with golden <HI>Flower de Luces.</HI> And after them the Dutche&s;&s;e of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> the Dutche&s;&s;e of <HI>Cheureu&s;e,</HI> and the Dutche&s;&s;e <HI>Elbeuf,</HI> with a world of other Ladies and Gentlewomen, which like &s;o many faire Planets mouing in their &s;eue|rall orbes, made all the place like the Heauens &s;parkle with renowne and glo|ry about them. After the&s;e came a lit|tle world of Noble-men, Knights, and Gentlemen. And la&s;t of all came the Kings principall and chiefe Guard, con|&s;i&s;ting onely of <HI>Stots</HI> and no other.</P>
<P>All this royall and admired a&s;&s;emblie
<PB N="14" REF="9"> hauing in this worthie equipage before de&s;cribed, aduanced them&s;elues from the Kings Ca&s;tle of the Louure to our La|dies Church, they all made a &s;tand at the entrie of the great porch of the Church, before which was a mo&s;t &s;tately &s;caffold mounted whereon to celebrate the mar|riage, and in which place was rai&s;ed a wonderfull rich and curious Canopie or vealt royall of cloth of gold richly em|brodred, and held almo&s;t of and incom|parable valew: to this Canopie or Vealt royall the King and Mon&s;ieur his bro|ther conducted the Royall Bride their &s;i&s;ter, and placing her vnder it, they there left her till &s;ome ceremonie were fini|&s;hed, then they re&s;igned her vp into the hands of the Duke of Chereu&s;e, to whom the Cardinall <HI>de la Roche Foncault</HI> came and performed all the ceremonies of marriage according to the orders of the Church, and the royall ceremonies of the French Nation, all acclamations of ho|nour and renowne ringing about the
<PB N="15" REF="9"> Church in a wonderfull manner.</P>
<P>The ceremonies being thus fini&s;hed all, the troopes and orders before rehear&s;ed, pa&s;&s;ed in a mo&s;t &s;olemne manner vp in|to the quire through along the gallerie, principally erected for that purpo&s;e, and going by a direct line, iu&s;t through the midde&s;t of the Church, and euery part thereof hung and adorned with won|derfull rich cloth of Arras, being more then three quarters of gold or &s;iluer.</P>
<P>In the midde&s;t of the quire on both &s;ides were placed diuers eminent and &s;tately &s;eates of more re&s;pect and view then any formerly repeated, on the prin|cipall &s;ide whereof &s;ate all my Lords the Pre&s;idents of the Parliaments of France, with their morters of gold vpon their heads, and their gownes, robes and hoods of rich &s;carlet all lined with Ermines, and &s;ome &s;mall degree below them &s;at all the Councellors of the high Courts of Par|liament in gownes like vnto the Pre&s;i|dents, and other things appropriated vn|to their places.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="10">
<P>In oppo&s;ition vnto the&s;e, and in &s;eats of like eminence, &s;at fir&s;t alone by him|&s;elfe the Prouo&s;t of the Merchants of Pa|ris, cloathed in a long roabe of Crim&s;on and Purple, or Violet coloured Veluet, and neere vnto him the Sherifes of the Citie of Paris, and other principall Ma|gi&s;trates which were of e&s;peciall note both in the Citie and in the Vniuer&s;itie.</P>
<P>Not far from the&s;e &s;eates, and in the quire al&s;o was mounted another &s;caffold or flore, being rai&s;ed full three &s;teps high, vpon which was mounted another large and goodly Canopie or Tent royall, vn|der which the K. the Q. and the Q. mo|ther, &amp; <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> the Kings brother were placed and conducted this thereby the Duke of Cheureu&s;e, and the two extraor|dinarie Emba&s;&s;adors for the maie&s;tie of great Brittaine, who after they had &s;eene euerie ceremonie fitted, they withdrew them&s;elues into the Archbi&s;hops pallace vntil the whole &s;eruice was ended, &amp; then they returned againe to the K. &amp; Queene.</P>
<P>When the formes or ceremonies of the
<PB N="17" REF="10"> French deuotions were ended, and that the acclamations of the people had cary|ed ioy to euery proceeding, then the whole troope returned, in the &s;ame forme or equipage as they came thither vnto the Archbi&s;hops pallace, where the whole Court &s;upped, and were entertained with all the &s;tate, pompe, and magnificence that could bee deui&s;ed. During all the pompe and &s;olemnitie of which fea&s;t, there was heard &s;uch thundring vollies of Cannon, and other great &s;hot that the ecchoing report thereof was carried ma|ny leagues off, and euen iudgement it &s;elfe could not but &s;tand amazed to &s;ee and heare the wonderfull terrors which pro|ceeded from plea&s;ure and reioycings. Af|ter the&s;e infinite vollies of &s;hot, was &s;eene many other triumphes, as bonefires, fire|workes, fea&s;ts, mu&s;ickes of all kinds, and all &s;ounds, dancings, maskings, &amp; all ma|ner of reuells, that France &s;eemed to in|tend nothing but the pre&s;ent raui&s;hing ioy, &amp; well; &amp; truly may it be &s;aid of her
<PB N="18" REF="11"> that then now &s;he was neuer &s;eene more plea&s;ant, neuer more abundantly clothed with contentments and comforts.</P>
<P>But here lea&s;t I might be thought to gallop too &s;wiftly ouer the glorie of this high &s;tate and magnificence, and like the dogs vpon the riuer Nilus to catch here and there a lap running, I will borrow leaue a little to &s;peake of the powerfull &s;tate and magnificence of this hardly pa|ralleld fea&s;t and &s;umptuous triumph.</P>
<P>It is therefore fir&s;t to be vnder&s;tood that this glorious and royall fea&s;t was held in the great hall belonging to the Archbi&s;hops pallace, being a roome of wonderfull long extent, the table &s;tretch|ed out from the one end of the hall to the other, and being couered and adorned with wonderfull rich damaske, and the &s;alts and other apparrell of infinite price and valew, the King of France &s;at in the midde&s;t of the table, and was &s;erued by the grand Prior of France, who that day repre&s;ented the per&s;on of the great Ma|&s;ter
<PB N="19" REF="11"> of France, before him marched eight drums, foure fifes, and &s;ixteene trumpets, be&s;ides a world of clarions, hoboyes, cor|nets, and other loud in&s;truments, his per|&s;on was accompanied with <HI>Mon&s;ieur Be|aumont,</HI> Lord grand Steward of the kings hou&s;e, and two and thirtie other inferior Stewards of his Maie&s;ties hou&s;hold with white &s;taues in their hands, and other en|&s;ignes of their &s;euerall places.</P>
<P>The meat was this day carried vp by the Lords, Princes, Dukes, Peeres, Mar|&s;hals, and Barons of France, followed by Knights, E&s;quires, Gentlemen of the Court, and other inferiour officers and &s;eruants. Now touching the particular &s;eruices of &s;tate, you &s;hall vnder&s;tand that <HI>Mon&s;ier Iainuilde</HI> &s;erued this day as the Lord great Pantler of France, the Duke of Elbeufe was Cupbearer, and the Earle of Harcourt was Caruer. The Queene mother &s;at on the right hand of the King, and her per&s;on was attended by the Duke of Belgard principall Sewer,
<PB N="20" REF="12"> the Duke of Vzias, and the Duke of Lux|embourge. The Queene of France her|&s;elfe &s;at on the right hand of the Queene mother, and was attended by the Duke of Aluine, the Duke <HI>Bri&s;&s;ac,</HI> and the Duke of Chaune. The Queene of great Brit|taine &s;at on the Kings left hand, and was attended by the Mar&s;hall <HI>de Vittry,</HI> who &s;erued her as great Pantler, the Mar&s;hall <HI>de Aubeterce,</HI> who &s;erued her as Cup|bearer, and the Mar&s;hall <HI>Ba&s;&s;ampiere</HI> as Caruer. My Lord the Duke of Cheureu&s;e &s;at next the Queene of great Brittaine, and was attended by the Lord of Roch|fort. The Earle of Carlile, and the Earle of Holland Emba&s;&s;adors for the Maie&s;ty of great Brittaine &s;ate next the Duke of Cheureu&s;e, and la&s;tly <HI>Mon&s;ier</HI> the Kings brother &s;ate neere vnto the Queene, and after him the re&s;t of the Peeres and Prin|ces, all which were &s;erued and attended on in mo&s;t magnificent and heroycall manner.</P>
<P>After the &s;olemnitie of this great

<P>Both the&s;e are at this time combined
<PB REF="17"> again&s;t vs, your Maie&s;ties humble&s;t and meane&s;t &s;ubiects.</P>
<P>When we remember what a glorious and good King wee haue lo&s;t. A King from his cradle to tho&s;e very yeeres that are the common mea&s;ure of this &s;hort line of Life, exerci&s;ed in all the wi&s;dome of well gouerning. A King that hauing ta|ken away the wall of Separation united two pui&s;&s;ant and military Nations redu|ced <HI>Ireland</HI> by forren plantations, gaue this Realme a large portion of the new world, and reigned aboue twentie yeares in &s;uch peace and felicitie, as was beyond the euent of former times; for euen in the happie daies of Queene <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of famous memory, her fir&s;t yeares were in|terrupted by a Rebellion in <HI>England,</HI> and her la&s;t by a Rebellion in <HI>Ireland.</HI> A King that by his incomparable Writings, pro|claimed him&s;elfe true <HI>Defender of the Faith;</HI> and like <HI>Io&s;ua,</HI> made the walles of &s;pirituall <HI>Ierico</HI> fall downe before him. When wee but remember this (as who

<P>But when we turne our eies and hearts vpon your mo&s;t excellent Maie&s;tie, the true Heire of all his Princely Vertues, when in your Royall Per&s;on wee &s;ee all the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings and fauours of God entai|led vpon vs, and by this happie Coniun|ction now de&s;cendable to all po&s;teritie: who can draw forth the Legions of his ioy in order, or finde a language fit for the gladne&s;&s;e of his heart.</P>
<P>He that is borne a King <HI>(mo&s;t Gratious Soueraigne)</HI> can hardly attaine one point of perfection in Gouernment, the know|ledge of obeying well. A contemplation which in one act of obedience in <HI>Henry</HI> the fift, (who was one of the noble&s;t Prin|ces that euer &s;wayed the Scepter of this Kingdome from the Conque&s;t to his times, and he matched with a Daughter of <HI>France</HI>) gaue extraordinary comfort
<PB REF="18"> vnto his Father, a wi&s;e and prudent King. What happine&s;&s;e then hath your Maie&s;tie &s;ealed vs an a&s;&s;urance of, who hauing in all the actions of your life beene an excel|lent Sonne to your Royall Father, can ne|uer be other then an excellent Father to your people. On the Throne <HI>(for Hills be&s;t di&s;couer Valleyes)</HI> Princes may with much aduantage, as in a per&s;pectiue gla&s;&s;e draw the &s;tate of the Common-wealth nearer their &s;ight; but when they de&s;cend from them&s;elues, and grow acquainted with the hearts and affections of their &s;ub|iects; this is to mea&s;ure the Valleyes at hand, and not at di&s;tance, and doth at once winne hope of their goodne&s;&s;e, and make vs in awe of their wi&s;dome.</P>
<P>Such were the effects of your Maie&s;ties Princely Iudgement, when in the la&s;t (by you made happie) Parlament, and in the A&s;&s;embly preceding it, your Highne&s;&s;e, <HI>Exuta purpura,</HI> forgetting you were the only Sonne of the King, became the Son of the Kingdome, and tooke vpon your &s;elfe the cares and de&s;ires of it. (By which,
<PB REF="18"> as by the balme of Gilead, our wounds were healed in time, and all of vs as much incouraged (in humble and dutifull manner) to pre&s;ent our iu&s;t greuances vnto you, as we are deterred from crea|ting any &s;uch out of our owne vaine or vnmannerly fancies. Your Maie&s;ties beames like tho&s;e of the Sunne-ri&s;ing were then mo&s;t comfortable, now that your Maie&s;tie is in the exaltation of your orbe, we cannot but hope to finde more benigne and &s;erene a&s;pects.</P>

<P> nothing was wanting that might &s;erue ioy or delight.</P>
<P>On Wedne&s;day the King and Queene departed from <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and rode in the mo&s;t triumphant manner that might be to <HI>Cobham</HI> Hall, finding (as before I &s;aid) all the high-waies &s;trewed with Ro&s;es, &amp; all maner of &s;weet flowers, &amp; here at <HI>Cob|ham</HI> they lodged al that night, where there was all plentifull entertainment, and nothing wanting that might adde any honour either to the King or Kingdome.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day being the Sixteenth of Iune according to our Computation the King and Queene departed from <HI>Cobham</HI> all the waies prepared as hath been before &s;hewed, and &s;o in mo&s;t glorious manner came to the City of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> where there was expectation of &s;ome &s;tay; but the day being &s;pent too farre they rid thorow the City, notwith&s;tanding the Maior, Magi|&s;trates &amp; Citizens of that City gaue both the King &amp; Queene a noble &amp; mo&s;t hear|ty welcome, and the Recorder of the City made vnto them a mo&s;t learned and elo|quent
<PB N="30" REF="25"> oration, for which both the King and Queene returned back their Royall thanks and &s;o pa&s;&s;ing away from the Ci|ty a braue volley of &s;hot and great Ord|nance was deliuered from the Shippes which lay vpon the Riuer.</P>
<P>From the City of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> the King and Queene came to the Towne of <HI>Graue&s;end,</HI> where whether it was the ig|norance of the <HI>Pourtereeue</HI> or the ouerru|ling power of weake (but imagined wi&s;e) Coun&s;ell, or that the preuiledge of old ru&s;ty cu&s;tome, or &s;ome other knot which my weake braine is not able to vn|tie. I know not, but mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured it is, that neither the <HI>Portereeue</HI> nor any of his bre|thren gaue the King or Queene any en|tertainment or tender of &s;eruice vntill their highne&s;&s;es were come into the very mid&s;t and as it were the very Center of their Towne, and there they made tender of their &s;eruice and obedience, which was receiued withall Royall alacrity both of the King and Queene, and &s;o they pa&s;&s;ed away in &s;tate towards the Bridge
<PB N="31" REF="25"> where the Barges of State attended their approach, here they di&s;mounted, and all the Nobilitie attending on each &s;ide of the Bridge, with a world of La|dies and Gentlewomen: here they tooke &s;ollemne leaue of the King and Queene, and ki&s;&s;ed both their hands, but &s;uch was the excellent di&s;po&s;ition of the Queene, and &s;o royall and bountifull, her grace and fauour, that to euery La|die that came to ki&s;&s;e her hand, &s;hee bowed her &s;elfe downe and ki&s;&s;ed their cheekes. A&s;&s;oone as the King and Queene were entred into their Barge of E&s;tate, and had a little put off from the &s;hoare, the Blocke-hou&s;e which &s;tan|deth vpon the Kenti&s;h &s;hoare fir&s;t let flie all her Ordnance, and &s;ent foorth a peale, that the Rockes and Chaulkie Cliffes re&s;ounded againe, which was no &s;ooner fini&s;hed, but immediately the Blocke-hou&s;e which &s;tandeth on the E&s;&s;ex &s;hore made an&s;were with the like Mu&s;icke, and di&s;charged all her Ordnance; &s;o that the &s;moake mixing
<PB N="32" REF="26"> and meeting together, made a cloud which enterpo&s;ed betwixt the earth and the Sunnes brightne&s;&s;e making an Euening at Noone day.</P>
<P>After the Blocke-hou&s;es had thus di&s;|charged all their Ordnance, then as the King and Queene pa&s;&s;ed along, the Shippes which lay and anchored in the way, di&s;charged their vollies di&s;tinctly after one another; In&s;omuch that the vollie was hardly euer found to cea&s;e for the pa&s;&s;age of twelue or fifteene miles together. And the neerer the King and Queene came to the Citie of London, the greater and greater &s;till the volley increa&s;ed. La&s;tly, a little before the King and Queene had &s;hot the Bridge, the Tower of London let flie her Ordnance, which did &s;o thunder and rattle in the aire, that nothing could be heard for the terror of the noice. The throng of &s;pectatours was &s;o great, that about two hundred being in a &s;hippe that lay almo&s;t drie, and leaning again&s;t the Wharfe, they with their waight
<PB N="33" REF="26"> and motion ouerthrew the Shippe into the Thames. And by the way during all this long pa&s;&s;age, both the King and Queene &s;tood publiquely in the o|pen Barge, and not onely di&s;couered them&s;elues to euery hone&s;t and cheare|full beholder, but al&s;o with all Royall affabilitie and grace di&s;tributed their fa|uours to all tho&s;e which came to ad|mire them, &s;o that there was not a li|uing &s;oule which did not in heart con|clude and &s;ay with the Poet,
<Q><L>Qua~ bene co~ueniunt et in vna &s;ede mora~tur</L>
<L>Maie&s;tas &amp; Amor.&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>And thus at la&s;t the King and Queene came to the Kings Palace at White-hall, where they were receiued with all the ac|clamations of ioy that might bee, and where I am now inforced to leaue them with this true and euer heartie prayer, that it would plea&s;e God to ble&s;&s;e them toge|ther with daies of the longe&s;t extent that euer made happie any mortall creature, to &s;end them faire and flouri&s;hing I&s;&s;ue, and when they &s;hall of nece&s;&s;itie be tran&s;lated

<HEAD>&para; The Fea&s;ting of the Duke <HI>de Cheueres,</HI> and the two French Emba&s;|&s;adours, with the declaration of the <HI>Ma|riage of the King and Queene.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Tue&s;day being the 21. of Iune, the great Banquetting-hou&s;e of White|hall was prepared, and hung very richly with hangings of Silke and Gold, where at the one end of the hou&s;e was placed the Chaires and Cloth of State, at the other end a &s;umptuous Cupbord of Plate in manner of an arch; in the middle of the hou&s;e was placed one other Cupbord, not &s;o great, but of a farre greater value, being Ba&s;ons, Ewers, Cups, Salts, &amp;c. all &s;et with Iewels, and of Chri&s;tall at the root. Then about eleuen of the clock the the King leading his Queen, accompanied with the Duke <HI>de Cheueres,</HI> and his Dut|ches, with the two French Emba&s;&s;adors, with all the re&s;t of the Nobilitie and La|dies, as well Engli&s;h, as Scots and French,
<PB N="35" REF="27"> in mo&s;t glorious attires and brauery, and &s;uch like as neuer before hath been &s;eene in <HI>England,</HI> &s;o that the Iewels of the Duke <HI>de Cheueres</HI> were reported to be worth an hundred thou&s;and pounds. The King being placed on this manner, with the Queene on his right hand, the Articles of the Marriage were read there in publique a&s;&s;embly, and approued by the King and the French Emba&s;&s;adors: After the which ble&s;&s;ing being giuen by a Bi&s;hop, the King ki&s;&s;ed the Queene in pre&s;ence of the whole people. After which they reti|red to the Priuie Chamber, while the din|ner was prepared, which was brought vp; after warning giuen with Drummes and Trumpets, whereunto the King, with the Duke and the two Emba&s;&s;adors came, the King &s;ate in his Chaire of E&s;tate, the Duke at the end of the Table, with one Emba&s;&s;adour at either hand, where in the time of Dinner the King dranke three Healthes to the Emba&s;&s;adors, which was proclaimed all ouer the hou&s;e, one to the King of <HI>France,</HI> one to the Queene, and
<PB N="36" REF="28" MS="y"> one other to the Queene Mother. Thus being fea&s;ted with three great &s;eruices, and mu&s;icke playing all the while, they ended the Banquet at foure of the clocke, and retired backe to the Priuie Chamber, where they continued one houre, and af|ter the King and the Queene, the Duke, and the re&s;t of the Nobilitie, Lords and Ladies, returned, where they had dancing for the &s;pace of one houre: which being done, the Duke returned to Somer&s;et|hou&s;e in great State, his Coach hauing eight hor&s;es, Coach-harne&s;&s;e, and all be|ing embrodered, together with three or foure &s;core of Coaches of the riche&s;t that euer was &s;eene in <HI>England,</HI> accompanied with diuers of the Nobilitie.</P>
