<HEAD>A IOVRNALL OF ALL the proceedings of the Duke of BVC|KINGHAM his <HI>Grace,</HI> in the Ile of <HI>Ree,</HI> a part of <HI>France.</HI> 1627.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_IVne</HI> the 24. 1627. being Sunday the Duke being in the good Ship of the Kings called the <HI>Triumph,</HI> weyed Ankor in <HI>Stodes</HI> Bay, and &s;ayled &s;o farre as St. <HI>Hellens</HI> Point; and on the Wedne&s;day following, &s;et &s;aile from that place, and was followed by 100. &s;ayle of Ships, little more or le&s;&s;e. That day we tackt to and againe, vntill wee had recouered the point Ea&s;t of the Ile of <HI>Wight:</HI> And on the Thur&s;day wee &s;tood on our way towards the We&s;t, vntill wee were come almo&s;t to the height of <HI>Plimouth;</HI> and then about 8. of the clocke at night we &s;tood off to the Sea Ea&s;t and by South, and vpon the Fry|day wee did &s;ee a point of Land on our Larboard bowe in our iudgements 12. leagues off, called the <HI>V&s;hing,</HI> in 47. degrees, or thereabout (a part of <HI>France.</HI>) Then we &s;tood off to the Sea that day, and Saturday, and Sunday, and Monday: on Monday towards night we did &s;ee 14. &s;ayle of Ships a head of vs, which &s;tood in toward vs about one houre,
<PB N="2" REF="3"> but by that time they had de&s;erued what we were, not liking to &s;peake with vs, they &s;tood away to the We&s;t before a winde: The Lord Admirall with 60 &s;ayle of &s;hips &s;tood after them, &s;ome 24. houres, but could not come vp to them, but did perceiue them to bee <HI>Dunkerks;</HI> and then againe &s;tood on his way for his intended Port.</P>
<P>Hauing lo&s;t the Lord <HI>Haruey</HI> in the <HI>Repul&s;e,</HI> with &s;ome 40. Saile of &s;hips with him, which did not follow the Admiral at the fir&s;t pur&s;uit of <HI>Dunkerks,</HI> but &s;tood &s;till to the Ea&s;t, and there they plyed to and againe for 8. dayes; So that the <HI>Admirall</HI> was come to Anchor neere the Ea&s;t end of the Ile of <HI>Ree</HI> on the Monday: and the Lord <HI>Haruey</HI> came thither on the Wedne&s;day, being the 10. of <HI>Iuly:</HI> but both had one part of one &s;torme.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Non&s;uch</HI> of the Kings had &s;pent her Fore ma&s;t, and &s;ome of the &s;hips that were with the <HI>Repul&s;e</HI> lo&s;t their long Boates (being towed at their &s;terne) but our happy meeting againe made our lo&s;&s;e to &s;eeme the le&s;&s;e. So we &s;pent two nights and one day in Coun&s;ell, and determining what was to be done to our be&s;t aduantage; and &s;o at la&s;t it was determined that the Souldiers &s;hould be landed on thur&s;day at the Ea&s;t end of the Ile of <HI>Ree,</HI> which was done about 3. of the clocke in the af|ter-noone, the <HI>Duke</HI> in per&s;on with the foremo&s;t,
<PB N="3" REF="3"> and cau&s;ing them to recouer as much ground as they could on the &s;ide of the hill: Did take his Barge againe, accompanied with ma&s;ter <HI>Grimes</HI> Gentleman of the Hor&s;e, and goes from one Shipp to another, to pray them to make all the ha&s;t they could po&s;sible: but returning to the Land againe, he found them in &s;uch a de&s;perate manner running into the Sea, to catch hold of any Boat to be gone, that they drowned them&s;elues and others: but tht Duke to appea&s;e the&s;e Reuolters, &s;tands in the head of the Barge, with his Sword drawne in his hand, praying &s;ome, and taxing other&s;ome with feare and cowardi&s;e, to returne to their Comman|ders on the &s;hore, which were in great danger: for had not Coronell <HI>Borowes</HI> and Coronell <HI>Brett</HI> be|&s;tird them&s;elues like valient men, and keeping their Regiments from Routing, the Enemy had had the honour of the day to all likelyhood, (for neuer was &s;eene &s;o braue a Charge as this.</P>
<P>They did &s;uffer vs to land &s;ome 2000. men, and then did the French Hor&s;e in 3. troopes, &s;ome 200 or more and &s;ome 1200 foot &s;o valiently charge into the midde&s;t of our Army vp to the &s;addle into the Sea, and &s;o valiently behaued them&s;elues, that very few of the Hor&s;e that came one did euer get of. If their Foot had bin as de&s;perate as their Hor&s;e, without que&s;tion we had lo&s;t the honour of the
<PB N="4" REF="4"> fir&s;t encounter: but God the di&s;po&s;er of all things, &s;trooke the Enemy with &s;uch feare, that they made as much ha&s;t as they could to be gone, and left vs to land all our men, and order them in battell array: the which was done that day, and the next all our Forces both men and hor&s;e were landed, and ma|king good that Fort, we did not &s;tirre from thence before Saturday night, and then aduancing for|ward not more then halfe a mile, wee re&s;ted that night.</P>
<P>On the Sunday Morning we marched vp into the Iland at lea&s;t 3. miles to a towne called <HI>Allaflote</HI> where the Mini&s;ter and &s;ome of the chiefe Pro|te&s;tants of the towne came to our generall (the <HI>Duke</HI>) and did deliuer them&s;elues and Towne into his hands: praying him that he would bee fa|uorable vnto the Papi&s;ts, and not put them to the mercy of the Souldiers, for feare lea&s;t heareafter the day that was lo&s;t might be recouered and &s;o the Prote&s;tants &s;hould be put all to the &s;word, the which the <HI>Duke</HI> taking into con&s;ideration did charge all the Soulders vpon paine of death, not to &s;tirre from theire collors, &s;o they re&s;ted all that night in the field and the <HI>Duke</HI> did take part with them, lying in the head of Coronell <HI>Borowes</HI> Regiment on a canuas Hor&s;e couered with two
<PB N="5" REF="4"> cloakes, his followers lying on the ground about him:</P>
<P>The next day a councell was called, and it was agreed on, that we &s;hould martch towards St. <HI>Martins</HI> on the Tu&s;eday morning, which was done; the <HI>Duke</HI> and <HI>Moun&s;ier Sebue&s;a,</HI> accompanied with &s;ome Lords and Knights did accompany the corps of Sir <HI>William Hayden</HI> to the Earth with much griefe, for the vnfortunat death of &s;o worthy a man, hee was buried at <HI>Allaflota,</HI> the <HI>Duke</HI> returnes to lodge in the field, but that night it did &s;o Lighten, Thunder, and Raigne, that I haue &s;eldome &s;eene the like.</P>
<P>On the Tew&s;day morning we marched on our apoyinted way although the morning was but little fairer then the night, but it plea&s;ed God that before twelue of the clock the &s;unne did &s;hew it &s;elfe fauourable in drying our wet cloathing, the enemy did &s;end out many &s;couts to looke vpon vs, but I thinke the longer they lookt on vs, the wor&s;e they liked vs, for I thinke our Armie from Front to Reare did take vp at lea&s;t one Mile and halfe: Yet then did march out of their fort &s;ome troopes of Hor&s;e, and &s;ome companies of foote and did make a &s;hew as if they would giue vs a battaile, but bee|ter adui&s;ing with them&s;elues they &s;uffered vs to Martch vntill we had gained both Sun and Winde of them.</P>
<PB REF="5">
<P>The <HI>Duke</HI> did at that in&s;tant time &s;o couragiou&s;|ly martch in the formo&s;t companies, that it did &s;o animate the Souldiers, that I haue hard many of the Souldiers wi&s;h that the <HI>French</HI> would &s;tand one Encounter, that they might &s;hew theire loue vnto theire Generall (but that would not be at this pre|&s;ent,) after we had martched vp to the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the towne &s;o farre as the Sea would giue vs leaue: we began to come nearer to the towne, our <HI>Drakes</HI> performing their parts on the Hor&s;emen that came foorth to &s;ee vs, and killed one gentleman and two Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>About fiue of the clocke at night, &s;ome of the chiefe men of the Towne came foorth with a flagge of truce, and did offer to deliuer them&s;elues and towne into the hands of our Generall: they being Prote&s;tans that were left, the <HI>Duke</HI> accepted of their offer, and &s;o marching into the Towne, and quartring his Soldiers in &s;euerall parts of it, did ride vp to the Pri&s;on hou&s;e, to &s;ee if any Engli&s;h were there, but finding none he returned to the water &s;ide, where Collonell <HI>Borowes</HI> quarter was, ther did he &s;ee the malice of the enemie in burning of three good &s;hip in the Harbour that had bin taken from the Engli&s;h: and then taking his barge, he went aboard the &s;hips, commanding all them to &s;end victuals a &s;hore for his Souldiers, &s;o
<PB REF="5"> that there was no want of any thing, although the Enemie had taken all their owne proui&s;ion, and the Prote&s;tants away with them into the Fort: and now doe they begin to batter night and day vpon the Towne with their Ordnance; but al|though they had battered from Tue&s;day vntill Fri|day night, I could not heare of more then one man that was killed: although the Fort be within Mu&s;|ket &s;hot of the Towne, and the &s;hot flying into all parts of the Towne as on Thur&s;day as the <HI>Duke</HI> and <HI>Sabue&s;a</HI> were talking, there came two &s;hot &s;o neere them, that they were faine to goe to end their di&s;cour&s;e in &s;ome other place: It was appointed that on the Saturday twenty field-Peeces at lea&s;t &amp; nine Drakes &s;hould be mounted again&s;t the Fort, with our Pyoners and our Souldiers to make &s;ome Trenching worke: but that I cannot &s;peake of, but will pray for a good &s;ucce&s;&s;e to their intent and pur|po&s;e: and &s;o for <HI>England</HI> with the good Shippe of the Kings called the <HI>Charles,</HI> whom God pre&s;erue.

<HEAD>A Iournall.</HEAD>
<P>_WEdne&s;day the 26. of Iune we &s;et &s;aile, but hauing the winde very contrary, we beate vp and downe the Sea vntill the &s;econd of Iuly, when we di&s;couered 14. Sailes of <HI>Dunkerkers,</HI> (as we afterwards vnder&s;tood;) My Lord Generall appointed &s;ome of his Shippes to chace them, who pur&s;ued them all night and next day, and fol|lowed them &s;o clo&s;e as they were forced in the night to fling ouerboord &s;ome of their Balla&s;t and their Stuffe, and to put foorth &s;tudding Sailes, and goe right before the winde, hauing lo&s;t ground vpon a tack and at veering, and &s;o not without difficultie e&s;caped vs.</P>
<P>From that day we beate vp and downe the Sea vntill the eight of Iuly, when the winde came good.</P>
<P>On wedned&s;day the tenth, we had a great tempe&s;t and verie thicke weather, and &s;o ob&s;cure, as being driuen by the winde neere the coa&s;t, and in the morning (not being able to make land) we ran a great hazard: But God be thanked, about noone the weather growing more cleere, we di&s;couered the Ile of <HI>Retz,</HI> and the &s;ame day we entred into the <HI>Pertuy Breton.</HI></P>
<P>The cha&s;e of the <HI>Dunkirkers</HI> did &s;eperate the Squadron of the Reare Admirall from vs (together) with &s;ome other Shippes, &s;o as my Lord Duke &s;taying for the arri|uall of the re&s;t of the Fleete, did nothing on tewe&s;day at night, &amp; on wedne&s;day morning but compa&s;&s;e the Iland with his Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;top all the entrances into the Iland.</P>
<P>On wedne&s;day at night arriued my Lord <HI>Heruey</HI> very happily with the Reareward, and next day at noone we landed.</P>
<P>After we had put on &s;hore vpwards of one thou&s;and Foote, the Enemie (who had laine in certaine hollow groundes) began to appeare, with aboute 300. or 400.
<PB N="12" REF="8"> Hor&s;e, the greate&s;t part Gentlemen well quallified, and neere one thou&s;and Foote of the Regiments of <HI>Cham|pagne.</HI> The Hor&s;&s;e were deuided into fiue &s;quadrons, whereof three gaue on very furiou&s;ly, and made three Ralim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">s and charges againe; and by the report of all that &s;aw them, neuer Caua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">liere did better; So as they draue &s;ome of our new Men, who were the la&s;t landed, &amp; the lea&s;t in order, into the Sea, where &s;ome of them were drowned; and they ouerthrew &s;ome Boates and drowned &s;ome Gentlemen of quallitie of our &s;ide who were pre&s;|&s;ing on to get on Land, and came within Pi&s;toll &s;hot of my Lord Generall, who was all the while clo&s;e by the Shore in his Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">, calling foorth and di&s;po&s;ing of the Boates as they went on land, for the &s;econd di&s;charge of the Boates after he had been on land with the fir&s;t, and cau&s;ed them to be drawne into a fitte place: But of tho&s;e who gane on, there were about 120 &s;laine, of the princi|pall Gentry, and the mo&s;t forward, with Pikes, Swords, and the but end of the Soldiers Muskets; the re&s;t got off, mo&s;t of them or their Hor&s;es wounded and vtterly rou|ted: And the two other Companies comming to giue on, iu&s;t as they were routed, were &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed, as they wheeled aboute, and neuer gaue &s;troake. The Infanterie came on in an other part, and gaue their fir&s;t Fires as neere and with as much re&s;olution as was po&s;&s;ible; But after they had ta&s;ted of our Pikes, they gaue quickly ouer, and ran away in the foule&s;t di&s;order that could be, and did not that day an&s;were the opinion that all <HI>France</HI> hath of the Regiment of <HI>Champagne.</HI></P>
<P>My Lord Generall had ordered certaine Shippes to &s;coure the landing place with their Ordinance, but the a&s;&s;ault was &s;o &s;odaine as they did little hurt to the Enemy; and in the very heate of the Combate, it fell out that one of our owne Shippes had engtangled him&s;elfe betweene our battering Shippes and the Land, by which meanes they were hindred in performing of their charge.</P>
<P>The Enemie lo&s;t &s;o manie Noblemen and Gentlemen of
<PB N="13" REF="8"> <HI>Marque,</HI> as the Hor&s;&s;e haue hardly euer &s;ince &s;hewed them&s;elues, nor neuer attempted any thing with effect: And the Foote haue kept them&s;elues wholy retired in their Cittadell.</P>
<P>That night and the next day was &s;pent on our &s;ide in retrenching &amp; in putting nece&s;&s;aries for our Soldiers on Land, and in landing of our Hor&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>The Enemie &s;ent a Trumpet with the Barron of <HI>Am|bleuille,</HI> to demande the Dead, who was receaued with &s;uch curte&s;ie, and the Dead rendred with &s;uch Militarie ho|nors, as they confe&s;&s;e them&s;elues no le&s;&s;e vanqui&s;hed by my Lord Generalls Fauours, then by his Armes.</P>
<P>The 14. day a Councell was kept, and the re&s;t of the day was &s;pent in vn&s;hipping of the Ordinance &amp; Muni|tion, and preparing of eight Drakes to be drawne along with our Forces by Men for want of carriage: And at night the Armie was drawne into Battaile, and &s;euen Companies, with Colonell <HI>Bartu</HI> were left in the re|trenchment.</P>
<P>On the 15. day, our Armie marched by fiue in the morning, and tooke in Saint <HI>Marie</HI> and <HI>la Flote,</HI> where they lodged that night: In which places my Lord Gene|rall left the Inhabitants in as great &s;uerty and more liber|tie then they were before; the Soldiers taking nothing but what they paide for.</P>
<P><HI>Moun&s;iere de Toyras</HI> had &s;ent a brauing complement that he would vi&s;it him that day; for which, my Lord Ge|nerall gaue the Bearer a good reward, but it prooued but a Complement.</P>
<P>The 16. his Grace repo&s;ed the Armie, and buried the Bodie of Sir <HI>William Heydon,</HI> with all Militarie honour, him&s;elfe and <HI>M. de Seabi&s;e</HI> accompaning the Corpes.</P>
<P>On the 17. the Armie marched to Saint <HI>Martines,</HI> the principall Towne of the Iland, as great as <HI>Plimouth,</HI> where the Enemies Cauelerie did appeare againe, whome our Infanterie had &s;o great a winde to be dealing with, as hardly the Officers could keepe them from &s;etting on
<PB N="12" REF="9"> them in di&s;order: But as they aduanced, they were &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">|ted with one of our Drakes, which killed two or three Hor&s;es, and hurt &s;ome Men.</P>
<P>Here one of our Cauelerie aduanced him&s;elfe and prof|fered a &s;ingle Combat, but no Man an&s;wered him.</P>
<P>This euening our Armie lodged as peaceably in Saint <HI>Martines</HI> as if we had been in Voyage and not in Warre; the Inhabitants receauing vs with great cheerefulne&s;&s;e, embra&s;ing <HI>M. de Sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;es</HI> feete, and calling him their good Prince.</P>
<P>There were taken &s;ome hurt Men and &s;ome Pri&s;oners in the Towne; and the Enemie quitting their Baricadoes, wholy retired them&s;elues into the Ci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">tadell.

<HEAD>A Iournall of the proceedings of my <HI>Lord</HI> DVKE <HI>in his Voyage.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_IVne the 24. 1627. being Sunday after Di|uine Seruice and Sermon, the Lord Gene|rall tooke his Barge, and enioyned all the Officers and Commanders to attend him to the Fleet, lying then at Anchor in <HI>Stokes</HI> Bay, which hee weighed the &s;ame day, and fell downe towards Saint <HI>Hellens</HI> poynt, where hee ca&s;t Anchor againe, and &s;tayed there for want of winde till the 27. of Iune. The &s;ame night hearing there were &s;ome Commaunders behinde in the Towne, who kept di&s;order; he went a &s;hore him&s;elfe, and &s;earcht all the hou&s;es in the Towne, where he found &s;ome Captaines that had been di&s;orderly: Among&s;t the re&s;t there was one that gaue an vnmannerly an&s;were, who was ca&s;heered for his labour.</P>
<P>That night the Lord Generall lay a &s;hore: the next mor|ning betimes he went a board. On Wedne&s;day the 27. wee weighed Anchor with 100. &s;ayle of Ships, and tackt to and againe vntill wee recouered the Poynt Ea&s;t of the Ile of <HI>Wight.</HI></P>
<P>Thur&s;day the 28. wee &s;toode on our cour&s;e towards the We&s;t, vntill we were come to the height of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> about eight of the clock at night: wee &s;toode We&s;t, and Ea&s;t, and by South. And on Friday the 29. wee &s;ayled with a &s;lacke winde; but before night wee got &s;ight of land on our Lar|board, &s;eeming to be 12. leagues off a part of <HI>France,</HI> called the <HI>V&s;hant,</HI> in 47. degrees or there-abouts. Wee &s;toode on to Sea that night, with a fre&s;h gayle of winde, which &s;erued
<PB N="2" REF="11"> vs vntill the next morning at two of the clocke, and then wee were becalmde till Monday the fir&s;t of Iuly, at foure of the clocke. At which time we &s;ent a Boy to the top of the mayne Ma&s;t, to &s;ee what he could di&s;couer, he &s;pied on the head of vs 14. &s;ayle of Shipps &s;ome foure leagues off, and very fortu|nately within a quarter of an houre after there aro&s;e a good gayle of winde fully with vs, &s;o that the Admirall and all the re&s;t made ha&s;t to hoy&s;t vp &s;ayle and cha&s;e the&s;e Ships. Before nine of the clocke at night a Catch of his Maie&s;ties ouertook them, which was commanded by Captaine <HI>Dunning,</HI> he cal|led to them and asked what they were, they tolde him a con|trary tale: he de&s;ired then to winde about, and come aboard and &s;peake with our Admirall. They bid him goe before to their Admirall, and what he did they would follow: he came to their Admirall and de&s;ired him to winde about and &s;peake with our Admirall. Their Admirall asked <HI>Dunning</HI> what Fleete it was, he tolde him it was the King of <HI>Englands</HI> Fleet, hee asked what they were doing there: hee tolde them they were Tacking to and againe to &s;coure the Seas. No (&s;aith he) I know you are going to <HI>Burdeaux,</HI> but there you will finde them prepared for you, and they will giue you hot &s;eruice. Hee asked who was our Admirall, hee tolde them my Lord Duke of <HI>Buckingham.</HI> Whereupon hee fell in rayling, and called vs all Roagues and Ra&s;calls, and commanded the Gun|ner to &s;hoote; he &s;hot halfe a dozen &s;hot at him, and &s;hor him twice through the &s;ayle, hard by the middle of the mayne Ma&s;t: &s;o that <HI>Dunning</HI> fell a &s;terne of him, and tackt about to vs, and tolde vs what had pa&s;t, and that he conceiued them to be <HI>Dunkerks</HI> men of Warre, very well appointed, which did much comfort our Generall, and all the re&s;t. We cha&s;ed them all night: and on Tue&s;day the 20. of Iuly at light day, wee had got neere vnto them with &s;ome of our Shipps. The <HI>Lyon</HI> had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ot the Winde-ward of them. Three of the <HI>Colly|ers,</HI> and the <HI>Maria,</HI> with the <HI>Catch,</HI> was got almo&s;t within &s;hot of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ut in this time they were throwing out their Balle&s;t, and making them&s;elues light: and when they had
<PB N="3" REF="11"> done that, they hoy&s;ed vp &s;tudding Sailes, and after out&s;ailed vs quite; We followed them &s;o farre, as there was no hopes, and then wound about to our intended cour&s;e: At foure of the clocke the &s;ame day, my Lord cau&s;ed to &s;end vppe to the maine Ma&s;t, to tell how manie Shippes we were in company, and we found we were then no more then three &s;core; for we had lo&s;t in that Cha&s;e my Lord <HI>Haruey,</HI> with fortie &s;aile of Shippes, who met not with vs till wedne&s;day the 11. of Iuly.</P>
<P>We were kept from the place where we intended (with contrarie windes and calmes) till tewe&s;day the 10. of Iuly; About two of the clocke, then fell a violent &s;torme, with a thicke mi&s;t, &s;o that we were put into great danger.</P>
<P>The <HI>None&s;uch</HI> in this &s;torme had &s;pent her Fore-ma&s;t, and many of the other Shippes lo&s;t their Long-boates, being ty|ed at the Sterne. About eight of the clock the &s;torme broke vp, and it grew to bee cleare; Then we di&s;cerned the I&s;le of <HI>Ree</HI> to be within three leagues of vs, whither we &s;teered our cour&s;e; And about ten of the clocke ca&s;t anchor ouer a|gain&s;t Saint <HI>Martines,</HI> the prime Towne in that I&s;land. The Next morning being wedne&s;day, we weyed anchor, and &s;ay|led downe lower to a point of the I&s;land next to the maine-Land, and ouer again&s;t <HI>Rochell.</HI> There we ca&s;t anchor, and placed our Shippes round about the I&s;land, that the Enemie might neither export nor import any thing for their aduan|tage.</P>
<P>That done, being the 11. of Iuly, we had very good &s;port in cha&s;ing tho&s;e Barques and Hoyes which were offering to goe from the I&s;land to the maine-Land, and from the maine-Land to the I&s;land: We tooke many of them, and there were none that got eyther in or out. About &s;ixe of the clocke that day, my Lord <HI>Haruey</HI> appeares with his fortie &s;aile of Ships, which was vnto vs a great comfort: About eight of the clocke the &s;ame day, the Lord Generall called a Councell, and re&s;olued to land our Men the next morning, vpon that point which lay iu&s;t to vs, as being the mo&s;t &s;afe place; At which time he gaue order to &s;ome Shippes to batter a Fort, which
<PB N="4" REF="12"> lay a league off on the right hand, &amp; continued the battering till ten of the clocke the next day; then we found there was no re&s;i&s;tance in the Fort, whereupon, the Lord Generall com|manded to giue ouer.</P>
<P>On tewe&s;day the 12. the L. Generall was vp and readie by three of the clock in the morning, and receiued the Com|munion that morning at fiue of the clocke, and after tooke his Barge and went aboard the <HI>Non&s;uch</HI> to Mon&s;iure <HI>Subce&s;a,</HI> and returned from thence at &s;ixe: At &s;euen of the clocke, Mon&s;iure <HI>Sabue&s;a,</HI> Mon&s;iure <HI>Blancarte</HI> and Sir <HI>William Becher</HI> went to <HI>Rochell:</HI> At eight of the clocke, the L. Generall &s;ent Ma&s;ter <HI>Grymes</HI> (the Gentleman of his Hor&s;e) with a Foote-boy of his that could both runne and &s;wimme well, and &s;ixe Muskatieres (to the point of the I&s;land, where they were to land their Men) to &s;ee if they could di&s;couer any Men or Ordnance, that they had planted there to encounter vs: When he came to the &s;hoare, he cau&s;ed the Foote-boy to &s;trippe him&s;elfe, and to run along, and he run three quarters of a mile into the Countrey, and found all that Coa&s;t cleere, &s;auing three Hor&s;e-men, that the Enemies had &s;et out to be Scoutes, which cha&s;ed him back to the Sea &s;ide; The Boy was releiued by the Ship Ordnance and the Muskets in the Boate: At ten of the clocke, he turned back to the <HI>Triumph,</HI> and gaue the L. Generall an accompt what he had di&s;coue|red; Whereupon, the L. Generall gaue pre&s;ent order for all Officers to be in a readine&s;&s;e, and to meete him aboard the Kings good Shippe (called the <HI>Lyon</HI>) lying next the Pointe, where they were to land their Men, for there he would keepe his Randeuous for that time: At twelue of the clocke, he tooke his Barge, accompanied with Sir <HI>George Blundell</HI> Ser|geant Maior, attended by M. <HI>Grymes</HI> and M. <HI>A&s;hburneham,</HI> and went to all tho&s;e Ships that had Land Soldiers, and com|manded them that they &s;hould pre&s;ently draw them&s;elues as neere that point of the I&s;land as they could; After that, he went to all the Ships, and appointed the Captaines of them, how and where to attend with their Shippes, and commanded
<PB N="5" REF="12"> them pre&s;ently to prouide their Barges and long Boates, to land their Land Souldiers, and to &s;end them to the Lyon. Hee then made choy&s;e of tenne Ships of le&s;&s;er burthen, and directed them to draw their Shipps as clo&s;e as they could to either &s;ide of the point of the I&s;land, where the Souldiers were to be Landed, and commanded them that if the Enemie did appeare within &s;hotte, they &s;hould pre&s;ently play vpon them.</P>
<P>He being aboard at the &s;ame time of one of the&s;e Shippes, went vp to the top of the mayne Ma&s;t, and di&s;couered of the Enemies three Troupes of Hor&s;e, and 16. or 18. hundred Foote, all ready in Battalia &s;ome Engli&s;h mile or more off the place, where wee were to land our men: hee came pre|&s;ently downe and tolde vs what hee had di&s;couered, and &s;hot at them him&s;elfe two or three Peeces of Ordnance, and com|manded the re&s;t of the Peeces to play vpon them &s;till: with that tooke Barge and went to the Lyon, where hee found all the Officers ready with their long Boates to land their men.</P>
<P>In this time came backe from <HI>Rochell</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Sabue&s;a,</HI> and Sir <HI>William Beecher,</HI> who &s;tayed there till Saturday fol|lowing. Mon&s;ieur Saint <HI>Blancart</HI> di&s;&s;waded the Lord Ge|nerall to forbeare the Landing of his men vntill the next morning: but the Lord Generall fearing it would giue time to the Enemie to &s;trengthen him&s;elfe. Hee would by no meanes heare of any delay. Whereupon Mon&s;ieur Saint <HI>Blancart</HI> like a braue man, choo&s;ed him&s;elfe a Pike, and put him&s;elfe into Sir <HI>John Burrowes</HI> Regiment.</P>
<P>By this time it was three of the clocke when the Lord Ge|nerall commanded to land two Regiments, that were of the olde Companies, whereof Sir <HI>Iohn Burrowes</HI> and Sir <HI>Alex|ander Brett</HI> were Commanders, he went with them him&s;elfe on &s;hore, and appointed the two Colonels in what place they &s;hould land their men. And being landed, commanded them to put their men in Battalia with all &s;peed, fearing the Ene|mie vvould giue them a &s;uddaine a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="13">
<P>The men being vveary in lying on Shipboard, lingred vva&s;hing their hands in the Sea; but the Lord Generall vvith a Cudgell runne to and fro among&s;t them, beating &s;ome, and threatning other-&s;ome, and got them thru&s;t vp three Pykes length to the skirt of the banke, vvhere they vvere to be.</P>
<P>There vvas a third Regiment that vvas ready to land: in the meane time came Sir <HI>William Courtney</HI> to the Lord Ge|nerall, and tolde him, that vnle&s;&s;e hee &s;hould doe the &s;ame curte&s;ie for him vvhich he did for the other two Collonells, hee &s;hould not get his men landed, and that his vvere olde Souldiers, and vvould doe good &s;eruice if the Enemie made a&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>Whereupon my Lord called Sir <HI>William Courtney,</HI> &amp; vvent into his Barge, vvith an intention to ha&s;ten a &s;hore his Re|giment, and as &s;oone as he had gone about foure&s;core from the &s;hore, hee pre&s;ently heard the fight begun, and turning backe, he &s;aw three Troupes of French Hor&s;e, charging our Foote vvith all the fiercene&s;&s;e that might be: And the third Regiment, tho&s;e that vvere vnlanded, pre&s;sing them&s;elues among&s;t the Shippes to &s;uccour them&s;elues: the re&s;t of that Regiment that vvere landed hee &s;awe pre&s;t into the vvater by the French Hor&s;e; and Sir <HI>William Haydon</HI> being caried violently to the Sea by the Reuolters, was there drowned.</P>
<P>Whereupon he &s;et S. <HI>William Courtney</HI> into another Boate, with commande to make all expedition to get his Men lan|ded; And very brauely him&s;elfe drew his Sword, and turned his Barge (attended by Ma&s;ter <HI>Grymes</HI> and M. <HI>A&s;hburneham</HI>) and thru&s;t him&s;elfe vpon the Reuolters; and rebuking &s;ome, and encouraging others, told them, he hoped they came not with any intent but to aduenture them&s;elues &s;o farre as he would leade them: Wherevpon, he thru&s;t him&s;elfe on to the &s;hoare, (and they followed &s;lowly) and animating of the o|ther Foote which were run into the water they mo&s;t of them leapt out of the water, and vpon the Lord Generalls words threw them&s;elues forwards as if they would haue fought brauely, but before we could get where the blowes were, the
<PB N="7" REF="13"> Battaile was ended.</P>
<P>My Lord Generall had ordered certaine Shippes to &s;coure the Landing place with their Ordnance, but the a&s;&s;ault was &s;o &s;odaine as they did little hurt to the Enemie; and in verie heate of the combate, it fell out, that one of our owne Shipps had entangled him&s;elfe betweene our Battering &s;hippes and the Land, by which meanes they were hindred in performing of their charge.</P>
<P>If the French Foote had come on to haue charged pre&s;ent|ly vppon the di&s;charge of the Hor&s;e, it had been impo&s;&s;ible that we could haue with&s;tood them; But as God would haue it, the Hor&s;e-men made more ha&s;t then in iudgement they &s;hould haue don: Before the Foote came we had killed mo&s;t of their Hor&s;es; But when the Foote did come, they came very orderly and brauely, being 1500. comming within a Pike and a halfe of our Men before they di&s;charged; and the Leader of the Foote (being a braue and goodlie Gentleman) tooke off his hatte, wherevpon all their Foote di&s;charged their Muskets, and after they fell to it with Swords and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">h of Pike, vntill they were breathle&s;&s;e on both &s;ides: The French finding our Pikes to be longer than theirs threw away their Pikes, and went to it with Stones, and &s;o did our Men, but ours beate them out, and made them flye away very di&s;|orderly, that happie was he that got fir&s;t off his Armor to betake him to his heeles.</P>
<P>This Battaile did not continue in all much aboue halfe an hower, but our Hor&s;e were not yet landed; But if we had had twentie Hor&s;e to haue followed them, we had killed them vp euery Man. That night we intrenched our &s;elues in that place, fearing the Enemie would giue vs an a&s;&s;ault in the night. My Lord Generall &s;pent that euening in viewing of the dead Bodies, and vi&s;iting tho&s;e that were hurt on our &s;ide, and giuing great charge to the Chirurgions to take &s;pe|ciall care of them.</P>
<P>We tooke fower of the French Gentlemen, but they were all hurt before; two of them dyed the next day, one of them
<PB N="8" REF="14"> is aliue yet in the <HI>Tryumph,</HI> his thigh being &s;hotte to peeces, the other, being a Page, the Lord Generall &s;ent him to his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The next morning very earlie, the Lord Generall came on &s;hore againe, and &s;pent all the whole daie there, calling the Commanders to him, and ordering them to bring him notes of euery &s;euerall Companie, how many they were, and how manie were peri&s;hed in the conflict; By which vve found, there was nineteene Captaines, Antients and Lieuetenants killed, and twelue other Officers hurt, but in no danger of death, and &s;ome thirty fiue common Soldiers drowned, but none killed; for the French men di&s;charged all on our Gen|try, and neuer looked at the Common &s;ort. Our Gentry (when the common Soldiers began to route) clapt them&s;elues together, and &s;hewed them&s;elues the braue&s;t Men in the world, e&s;petially Sir <HI>Iohn Burrowes,</HI> Sir <HI>Alexander Brett,</HI> Sir <HI>George Blundell,</HI> and a Brother of Sir <HI>Alexander Bretts:</HI> There was not one Gentleman of our Nation in the field that did not act his part brauely.</P>
<P>This being Friday, the day after the Battaile, the 13. of Iuly, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Thorax,</HI> Gouernour of the I&s;land, &s;ent the Barron <HI>Ambleuile</HI> with a Trumpet to &s;peake wth the Lord Generall: His Me&s;&s;age was, to de&s;ire my Lords fa|uour to giue them leaue to fetch away their dead bodies: they being &s;o &s;uddenly demaunded by them, my Lord made &s;cruple in granting it. Whereupon the Gentry made meanes by &s;ome of our Officers to buy the bodies, and offered for one 1000. pounds. When my Lord Generall had con&s;ide|red, he gaue leaue that they &s;hould take them away.</P>
<P>Within foure houres the Gouernours &s;ent another Trum|pet, with one of his Pages, to giue him thankes for his fa|uour, and to report to him that he would neuer after harbour an ill thought of the Engli&s;h, for hee iudged the Gentry of them to be the braue&s;t men in the world. Although before the Battaile he made no more account of vs then if wee had beene all Beeues: and enquiring what number we were, wee
<PB N="9" REF="14"> tolde him 6000. He &s;aid he would kill vs and &s;alt vs, as wee did Oxen in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>At the &s;ame time he &s;ent my Lord Generall word, that he would wayte on him him&s;elfe, &s;o that we made full account that hee would giue vs Battell. The &s;ame day wee put our &s;elues in Battalia, and expected them all that day, yet hee came not. The next day being the 14. of Iuly, we made our &s;elues ready to Martch, and at 6. of the clocke we marched an Engli&s;h mile further into the Countrey, leauing Sir <HI>Pere|grine Bartue</HI> in the place with &s;ome Companies.</P>
<P>The 15. by 6. of the clocke in the morning, vve marched on to a Village vvithin an Engli&s;h mile, and tooke in that vvithout any di&s;turbance. Then vve marched on two Eng|li&s;h miles further, to a Towne called St. <HI>Maries,</HI> vvhen vvee came neere to the Towne, the Prote&s;tants came out and yeelded the Towne to the Lord Generall, &s;o hee went with &s;ome Gentlemen with him, and tooke po&s;&s;e&s;sion, and made the Souldiers martch by, and not &s;uffer them to come to the Towne, fearing they vvould pillage and di&s;turbe the peo|ple; &s;o vve marched on the &s;ame day, to a Towne called <HI>La Flote.</HI> In the mid vvay the Enemie appeared vvith 120. hor&s;e and 1500. Foote, the which were left vnkilled. Wee did verily thinke they would haue giuen vs Battell, but it did not proue &s;o: for as &s;oone as they viewed vs, they returned backe againe.</P>
<P>We vvere ready for them, for our men vvere very forward to fight, &s;o vve marched on vvithin halfe a mile of <HI>La Flote,</HI> vvhere the Prote&s;tants of that Towne met vs, and &s;urren|dred the Towne and them&s;elues vvith a &s;uite they had to the Lord Generall, vvhich vvas that hee vvould for their &s;akes &s;hew fauour to the Romi&s;h Catholiques: for that they had liued long together in that Towne, and euer receiued good Quarter and v&s;age from them: And that now &s;eeing he vvas become Ma&s;ter of both, he vvould requite it on their behalfe to the Catholiques, vvhich hee very Nobly con&s;ented vnto, and vvent vvith them to the Towne, and tooke po&s;&s;e&s;sion,
<PB N="10" REF="15"> and pre&s;ently turned backe to the Souldiers, and Encamped them round about the &s;ame, and vvould not &s;uffer any of them to goe into it, fearing they vvould make Pillage, and that night lay among&s;t them in the open Field, vvith no o|ther bedding, &s;aue one Cloake vnder his head, and another vpon him.</P>
<P>The next day being the 16 he went into the Towne, ac|companied with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Sube&s;a,</HI> and &s;ome other Lords, to bury Sir <HI>William Heydon,</HI> and returned into the Field at night, and lay as he did before. But that night about two of the clocke, there fell very mi&s;erable vveather, vvith Thun|dering and Rayning, and continued &s;o till twelue of the clock the next day.</P>
<P>The next day, being the 17. vve martched on towards St. <HI>Martyns,</HI> though it Rayned very fearefully: and about 12. of the clocke it grew faire; at which time vve vvere vvithin three Engli&s;h miles of the Towne.</P>
<P>By that time we had marched a mile further, we could &s;ee the Enemie &s;ally out of the Fort vvith Hor&s;e and Foote: &s;o they Martched towards vs, and vvere vvithin the di&s;tance of an Engli&s;h mile: and wee thought they vvould take the aduantage of our weary Martching, and giue vs Battell.</P>
<P>Therefore it was holden fit by the Lord Generall, that we &s;hould take all aduantage we could in that place, which was onely to gaine the Sunne and the Winde of them. We mar|ched on toward the end of the Towne, that lay next vnto the Sea &s;ide, and furthe&s;t from the Fort. And by that wee had aduantage both of Sunne and Winde. Within le&s;&s;e then an Engli&s;h mile of the end of the Towne, we could &s;ee the Hor&s;e approach very fiercely, as though they would come &s;uddenly vpon vs.</P>
<P>Whereupon the Lord Generall gaue order to the Ma&s;ter of the Ordnance, to &s;hoote &s;ome of our Drakes at them; which he did, and killed a Gentleman and two Hor&s;es, and put all the re&s;t in feare and di&s;order.</P>
<P>Here Captaine <HI>Coningham</HI> (Lieutenant of the Hor&s;e) ad|uanced
<PB N="11" REF="15"> him&s;elfe on hor&s;ebacke, and proffered a &s;ingle com|bate, but no Man an&s;wered him. Whereupon they pre&s;ently put out a Flagge of Truce, and &s;ent &s;ome of the Prote&s;tantes to vs to render the Towne, without any condition; So that we pre&s;ently marched into it in Battalia, and quartered all our Soldiers therein. The Lord Generall rode to euery Com|pany, and de&s;ired them to be carefull of them&s;elues and not to wrong the Towne, and that they &s;hould take nothing but what was giuen them and what they payde for, and that he would goe aboard the victualing Shippes, and told them they &s;hould want nothing, which contented them verie well, and thanked God with a loude voyce that they had &s;uch a worthy Lord Generall.</P>
<P>He tooke his Barge, and accordingly went, and as he was going, there was a poore Engli&s;hman in di&s;tre&s;&s;e in a Sand|bed, where the Tyde had locked him about, and had no meanes to &s;aue him&s;elfe, but mu&s;t runne towards the Fort, where the Enemie was retired with all his Forces: My Lord hearing him &s;o cry out, cau&s;ed to &s;tay his Barge (although the Barge-men told him he would endanger the ca&s;ting away of him&s;elfe; and the Gentlemen per&s;waded him al&s;o, that he &s;hould not hazard him&s;elfe in the danger, yet would he not &s;tirre before he had releeued this Man and got him into his Barge; So after went aboard of the Victualing Shippes, and &s;aw all the proportions of the Victuals &s;ent to the Soldiers; and after went aboard the <HI>Tryumph.</HI> And on wedne&s;day the 16. made a di&s;patch for <HI>England,</HI> to acquaint the King with his fortunate proceedings.</P>
<P>The Enemy was retired into the Fort a Musket &s;hot, with 1500. Men, of which number, there was 120. Hor&s;e left; they had neyther Water nor Wood in their Fort, and had but &s;ome eight or nine Peeces of Ordnance, and the Fort too little for &s;o great a Company, &s;o that it was not likely that they could hold it long, and we hope to be Ma&s;ters of it, as well as of the I&s;land, within a very &s;hort time.</P>
<P>Thur&s;eday and Fryday, we were ray&s;ing a Mount to plant
<PB N="12" REF="16"> our Ordnance again&s;t it.</P>
<P>Saterday the 21. we planted twentie one peeces of Ord|nance, and eleuen Drakes, and the Ma&s;ter Gunner was very confident to batter them from the Fort in a very &s;hort time: We were working with our Pyoniers, and our Soldiers tren|ching again&s;t the Fort.</P>
<P>This is all I was an Eye witne&s;&s;e to. So God &s;end them good &s;ucce&s;&s;e, and I for <HI>England,</HI> in his Maie&s;ties Good Ship, called the <HI>Charles.</HI></P>

<P>THe Cittadell in the I&s;le St. <HI>Martins,</HI> holds out &s;till, the Walls and Fortifications thereof being made &s;o &s;trong and &s;ub&s;tantiall, that our Cannon that beate on it perpetu|ally could doe little hurt to it, in &s;o much as my Lord wrought by Mynes, and hath cut off two Pipes that carried vvater to the &s;ame, but findes that part of the ground which is penetrable neere the Cittadell, to be loo&s;e &s;andy ground, which will not Mine, and the foundation of the Cittadell, and the part neere the &s;ame is Rocky, not to be wrought: &s;o as my Lord hauing beaten the Enemie out of his out-workes into the Fort, is re&s;olued to endeuour to recouer the &s;ame by famine, there being 3000. men in the Ca&s;tle, and they want|ing Firing and Water. My Lord hath planted aboue 20. Peeces of Ordnance by Sea and Land again&s;t the Cittadell: and the third &s;hot that the Kings Cananere made, killed 41. French men, as &s;ome who were then in the Fort related.</P>
<P>My Lord lately intercepted two &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els laden vvith Victuals, and one laden vvith Munition, vvhich vvere in the night, pa&s;sing from the mayne ouer the Riuer to releeue the Cittadell, that vvhich vvas laden vvith Munition, vvas in the taking &s;unke vvith a Shot, and 37.

<P>My Lord walkes the round mo&s;t nights, to &s;ee the Watch performe their Duty: And Sunday la&s;t vvas &s;eauen dayes lay in our Trenches all night, vpon aduerti&s;ements, that the E|nemie vvould &s;ally, and a&s;&s;ault the men in our Workes.</P>
<P>My Lord <HI>Montioy</HI> (chiefe Commaunder of the Hor&s;e) very happily &s;urprized 28. of the be&s;t of the Enemies Mu&s;|katieres, vvho vvere &s;ent out of the Fort for a guard to &s;ome vvho vvere &s;ent to fetch vvater at a Well, not farre di&s;tant

<P>My Lord hath by Proclamation giuen permi&s;sion to the Inhabitants of the Ile to make Salt, with which Commodity his Grace intendeth to &s;atisfie the Dutch men (who were ta|ken vp to tran&s;port Hor&s;es and Proui&s;ions for the Armie) for the hire of their Ships, and likewi&s;e to furni&s;h <HI>England</HI> with Salt.</P>
<P>The Gouernour of the Cittadell and Ile of St. <HI>Martins,</HI> &s;endeth euery day &s;ome Me&s;&s;enger to &s;peake with my Lord: And about tenne dayes &s;ince vnder colour of a Parly, &s;ent a Di&s;ciple of the Ie&s;uites to haue mi&s;chieued his Grace: the Villaine being come to act his Villanie, when hee began to &s;peake to my Lord, changed his colour, and &s;o trembled, that he could &s;carce &s;peake: whereupon his Grace commaunded one that was with him, to &s;earch him, &amp; there was found in the Sleeue of his Doublet, a long <HI>Rauilliack</HI>-like Knife poy|&s;oned, which at the fir&s;t he &s;aid he caried for his defence: but that being no place to carrie a Weapon for defence, he was that night committed, and being threatned to be tortured, hee de&s;ired to be brought before the Lord Generall, which was graunted; and then he confe&s;&s;ed that the Gouernour had di&s;siplined, and hired him to murther my Lord: and being que&s;tioned how he dur&s;t vndertake &s;uch a mi&s;chieuous work, &s;ince he could not hope to e&s;cape death, or enioy the reward he was to haue: he &s;aid he did beleeue it would co&s;t him his life; but being per&s;waded, it was a meritorious worke, and promi&s;ed, his Wife and Children for it &s;hould be aduanced, he vndertooke the &s;ame; and falling downe at my Lords feet, be&s;ought his pardon. My Lord &s;ent him backe to the pri|&s;on, and after three dayes pardoned him, and &s;ent him ouer into the mayne.</P>
<P>All Souldiers cry out again&s;t the Gouernour for this trea|chery, and &s;ay, hee de&s;erues not to haue any Quarter, that would offer the &s;ame to one who hath in all poynts caried
<PB N="15" REF="17"> him&s;elfe &s;o Nobly towards him, and all the French that haue beene at his mercy, for my Lord &s;ent him back his Brothers Page, which was taken in the day of Battell; and hauing found the Gouernours brothers Gentleman of his Hor&s;e wounded in the Field, cau&s;ed him to bee &s;ent a board his owne Ship, and looked vnto by his owne Chirurgion.</P>
