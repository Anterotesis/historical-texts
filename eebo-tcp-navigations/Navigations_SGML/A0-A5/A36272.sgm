<P>AMong the Laws of the <HI>Roman</HI> Tri|umphs, as &s;ome were very Bloudy and Barbarous, &s;o others were wi&s;e and worthy our Imitation. In all tho&s;e o&s;tenta|tions of their Glory, there was ever a mix|ture of Religion, &s;uch as it was; a ceremonious and pompous application to their imaginary
<PB N="IV" REF="3">Deities,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Livius Pa&s;&s;i n.</NOTE> <HI>Ut ob res bene ge&s;tas Diis immortalibus honos habeatur &s;ibique Triumphanti urbem invehi liceat,</HI> was the form of their Petition who &s;ued for that honour. <HI>Idolatry</HI> (the great Mother of <HI>Athe|i&s;me</HI>) was not able to extirpate the natural Conviction which every one hath in him&s;elf of an Almighty Power governing the Uni|ver&s;e. But it kept a room; even in tho&s;e mens Brea&s;ts who were &s;o full of them&s;elves, that they expected to be adored by the re&s;t of Mankind. That Triumphant <HI>Dictator,</HI> who lorded it over the Lords of the world, before who&s;e Axes <HI>Con&s;uls</HI> and <HI>Pretors</HI> trembled, while he trod proudly on the necks of Captive Kings, and dragg'd them chained like &s;laves after his Chariot, would at the &s;ame time fall down before a Captive Stock or Stone; <HI>lower</HI> his <HI>Rods</HI> and <HI>Lawrels;</HI> Pro&s;trating him&s;elf with all the En&s;igns of his Power and Honour, to a rotten deformed <HI>Idol</HI> which he had brought home in a Cart. This was another Triumph in and over their Triumphs, a victory of Re|ligion over Infidelity in its greate&s;t &s;trength and exaltation; for though the Devil did &s;o far debauch the under&s;tandings of rea&s;onable Creatures, as to make them wor&s;hip him in|&s;tead of God; yet while &s;ome wor&s;hip was practi&s;ed, and they cho&s;e rather to adore a ri|diculous abominable Deity then none; Even
<PB N="V" REF="3">by the&s;e Prophane &s;acrilegious Rites, the Prin|ciple of a <HI>God</HI> was kept alive and warm in the minds of men; for a <HI>Handle</HI> whereby <HI>in ful|ne&s;s of time,</HI> Chri&s;t and his holy Doctrine took hold on a lo&s;t World, and pull'd them back to the &s;ervice of the True God. Another thing I ob&s;erve which will be more to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e; They admitted not a <HI>General</HI> to tri|umph, unle&s;s he had fini&s;hed the de&s;ign upon which he was imployed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Perduellibus victis, Confe|ct&acirc; Provinci&acirc;.</NOTE> and &s;o broken the enemy that he might bring his army home with him, leaving the <HI>Province</HI> quiet to his Succe&s;&s;or. But upon any con&s;iderable &s;uc|ce&s;s they would make &s;olemn and publick <HI>&s;up|plications</HI> to all their Gods and Godde&s;&s;es, in the name of their ab&s;ent Commander, that he might by their favour perfect the Conque&s;t which he had already happily began or ad|vanced. This is <HI>our</HI> ca&s;e. We are not yet rea|dy for a <HI>Triumph,</HI> but have matter enough for Supplications and Thank&s;givings. Our Ene|mies are not &s;ubdued, but by Gods help they are in good mea&s;ure broken and defeated; Our Noble <HI>Con&s;uls</HI> are not yet &s;ailing homeward with Lawrels on their <HI>&s;tems,</HI> but they are very conveniently <HI>po&s;ted</HI> on the Enemies Coa&s;t, as Pregnant in&s;tances to <HI>them</HI> of one <HI>victory</HI> already obtained, and hopeful <HI>Pledges</HI> to <HI>us</HI> of another to follow. And therefore although our joy
<PB N="VI" REF="4">be bounded and circum&s;cribed, to keep us mode&s;t, and &s;ober, and humble; yet have we not onely ground &s;ufficient, but many high obligations that our Thank&s;givings be hearty, and zealous, and univer&s;al; full of Devotion and &s;en&s;e of our Duty to God; expre&s;&s;ed by ardent Love to his Goodne&s;s, Tru&s;t and affi|ance in his Mercy, wor&s;hipping his Maje&s;ty by con&s;tant Prayers and Prai&s;es: the onely means to ble&s;s and con&s;ecrate our pa&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es, and to procure his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in our fu|ture undertakings. All which (that I may not &s;eem to teach a Chri&s;tian Congregation onely by <HI>Heathen</HI> examples) you will find re|commended to your imitation in the Practice of <HI>David</HI> upon a like occa&s;ion. So the Title en|forms us, both here, and 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 22.</P>
<P>The Text look two ways, <HI>Backward</HI> upon all the Mercies and Deliverances which God had be&s;towed upon <HI>David,</HI> which he acknow|ledgeth in the many glorious Titles a&s;cribed to God, in the fir&s;t and &s;econd Ver&s;e, My <HI>Strength,</HI> my <HI>Rock,</HI> and my <HI>Fortre&s;s,</HI> and my <HI>Deliverer;</HI> my <HI>God,</HI> my <HI>Buckler,</HI> and the <HI>Horn</HI> of my Salvation, and my High <HI>Tower.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Forward,</HI> in the returns of Duty, to which he engageth him&s;elf: Of <HI>Love,</HI> ver&s;. 1. <HI>Tru&s;t,</HI> ver&s;. 2. <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> and <HI>Prayer,</HI> ver&s;. 3. Upon all which he] grounds to him&s;elf a firm Hope
<PB N="VII" REF="4">of being &s;aved from his Enemies; <HI>So &s;hall I be &s;aved from mine Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>I begin with <HI>Davids</HI> acknowledgment of Gods mercies, expre&s;&s;ed in the Titles of <HI>Strength, Rock, Fortre&s;s, &amp;c.</HI> Of all the&s;e words I &s;hall not need to &s;peak Particularly, they be|ing but &s;o many <HI>Synonymous</HI> Phra&s;es, &s;ignify|ing one and the &s;ame thing, That God had often with great Demon&s;trations of his Power and favour &s;uccour'd, and &s;aved <HI>David.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"></NOTE> Where|fore the Greek Tran&s;laters have cho&s;en rather to deliver the mind and intention of the P&s;al|mi&s;t in plain words, then to render literally the metaphors of the original. Yet mu&s;t we not take this meerly for the exuberance of a <HI>Poetical</HI> &s;tyle, much le&s;s can we imagine <HI>Da|vid</HI> to be guilty of that <HI>Battology,</HI> and tho&s;e <HI>vain repetitions</HI> in his Devotions which our Sa|viour condemns in the <HI>Heathens,</HI> Matth. 6.7. It was their practice to wor&s;hip Vanity with Vanity, heaping in their Prayers a multitude of empty in&s;ignificant names upon their vain and more in&s;ignificant Deities. But this ex|aggeration in <HI>Davids Hymn</HI> flows from the a|bundance of a devout and grateful heart, la|bouring to empty and di&s;charge its fulne&s;s, &s;trugling with <HI>Human</HI> infirmity the narrowne&s;s of our Conceptions, and the poverty and bar|renne&s;s
<PB N="VIII" REF="5">of Speech, and endeavouring by any means to intimate, if not expre&s;s tho&s;e tran&s;|ports and exta&s;ies which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his &s;oul up|on the contemplation of Gods Maje&s;ty and Goodne&s;s. Be&s;ides (as the <HI>Title</HI> both here, and 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 22 directed to ob&s;erve before) this <HI>Hymn</HI> was made in commemoration of all the great things God had done for <HI>David,</HI> and &s;o <HI>many</HI> various mercies could not be compre|hended under any <HI>one</HI> Notion: His <HI>dangers</HI> and di&s;tre&s;&s;es had been &s;o numerous, and both in their kind and circum&s;tance &s;o <HI>different,</HI> and <HI>Gods</HI> ways of <HI>vindicating</HI> his &s;ervant &s;o <HI>unlike</HI> one another; &s;ometimes by <HI>warning</HI> him of trea|cherous de&s;igns, that he might avoid or coun|terwork them; &s;ometimes by <HI>defeating</HI> dange|rous Councels, and turning pernicious wi&s;|dom to folly; By <HI>diverting</HI> his Enemies, By defending him again&s;t their force, or by ena|bling him to <HI>overcome</HI> it. And as &s;o many and &s;o different things could not be put together in one <HI>&s;tanza</HI> of a <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> otherwi&s;e then in gene|ral terms, &s;o <HI>David</HI> could not &s;atisfie him&s;elf but by crowding in all the general words and <HI>Appellatives</HI> which plain or figurative &s;peech afforded,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="foreign"> Theodoret. in Locum.</NOTE> accompanying doubtle&s;s every &s;e|veral word with a proper di&s;tinct act of Devo|tion, a new heat and flame of love and zeal; &s;o that all together (like the <HI>Milky way</HI>) they
<PB N="IX" REF="5">&s;eem one Cele&s;tial fire, but are many.</P>
<P>That we may &s;ee how well &s;uch a full acknowledgment would become us, how well all the&s;e Names and Titles attributed by <HI>David</HI> to God would &s;ound in our mouths, if we would a&s;cribe them with <HI>Davids</HI> Devotion and Affection; Give me leave to look back, not &s;o far as he does, to the <HI>whole life</HI> of a Man, but to that new <HI>Epocha</HI> of our lives, the new Birth and <HI>Re&s;tauration</HI> of all things to us. Me|thinks that &s;hould be remembred every <HI>Thank&s;|giving-day,</HI> without which we &s;hould never have had any Thank&s;giving day at all. Con&s;i|der then in what condition we were this time <HI>&s;even years,</HI> when the la&s;t <HI>Effort</HI> we could make, or Project for the recovery of our Country, was mi&s;erably defeated; Shall I &s;ay by the Trea|chery of &s;ome, the folly and cowardize of o|thers, or rather by the good Providence of God? who de&s;igned to &s;hew us the vanity of all our contrivances, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of our being &s;aved by any other means, then the miraculous interpo&s;ition of his help, and there|by make us humble enough for &s;uch a De|liverance. You cannot but remember, That we did not then draw our Breath, otherwi&s;e then <HI>Precariou&s;ly,</HI> and at the mercy of impotent <HI>Fanatical,</HI> and now enraged Tyrants, from who&s;e <HI>Principles,</HI> as well as malice, nothing
<PB N="X" REF="6">was to be expected but Robberies, Ma&s;&s;acres and De&s;olations; private mi&s;chiefs and pub|lick Ruine. Men that could not po&s;&s;ibly agree to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves, and be&s;ides that they con&s;pired to undo all but them&s;elves; their very di&s;agreement (had they de&s;igned nothing towards it) mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have de|&s;troyed the Nation.</P>
<P>Who would have expected, that through this black Cloud, a comfortable light, and day of Salvation, &s;hould dawne and break upon us within a few Months? Who dur&s;t hope, or almo&s;t Pray, (in &s;o deep a de&s;pair) that out of this horrid <HI>Chaos,</HI> a World of Beau|ty and Order &s;hould ari&s;e &s;o &s;oon, and we be &s;urpri&s;ed (as in a dream) with a perfect re|&s;cue from all we feared, and a quiet enjoy|ment of what&s;oever we could wi&s;h? This was clearly the <HI>Work</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and God alone; a meer miracle of Mercy, wrought in de&s;pight of &s;o much actual <HI>force</HI> at home, &s;o much <HI>Councel</HI> of all States and Princes abroad, and the yet more dangerous oppo&s;itions of our own <HI>Provocations,</HI> perver&s;ly and in&s;olently contending again&s;t Gods goodne&s;s, and ma|king it far more rea&s;onable for us to look for a <HI>hand upon the Wall,</HI> writing a vi&s;ible inrever|&s;ible &s;entence of extirpation, then &s;ecretly and powerfully working our deliverance behind
<PB N="XI" REF="6">it. And therefore were there nothing el&s;e in our ca&s;e, we mu&s;t confe&s;s that this alone hath filled all the expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>David</HI> in my Text, and we &s;hall think our &s;elves bound for ever to celebrate our Good God as our <HI>Refuge and Defence, our Deliverer, the Horn of our Salvation, and our High Tower, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>TO come clo&s;e and home to our pre&s;ent bu|&s;ine&s;s; When the impudent inju&s;tice of our <HI>Neighbours</HI> made this <HI>War</HI> nece&s;&s;ary, we &s;oon &s;aw we &s;hould be engaged to contend with the mo&s;t powerful enemies in the World, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any friend; And, perhaps this little world of ours, were it una|nimous and entire, vigorou&s;ly exerting all its force, might be able to defend it &s;elf again&s;t &s;o much of the greater. But we are full of <HI>Ca|price,</HI> and humorous Emulations and <HI>Piques,</HI> which trouble and di&s;countenance, and wor&s;e things which hinder and ob&s;truct Publick En|terpri&s;es. The infirmities of &s;ome, and the wickedne&s;s of others weaken our hands, and make us little more then <HI>half</HI> our &s;elves: <HI>One</HI> &s;ort do no good, and <HI>others</HI> all the harm they can. So de&s;perately mad are they,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Liv. l. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> that like <HI>Ap|pius</HI> his Legions, they would rather be de&s;troy|ed by any Enemy, then live to &s;ee their <HI>Prince</HI> have the honour of &s;aving and defending them.</P>
<PB N="XII" REF="7">
<P>The&s;e things &s;hame us, and di&s;advantage our Cau&s;e; but they exalt the Glory of God, and make his help afforded us more con&s;picu|ous: For notwith&s;tanding all this, He gave us the <HI>la&s;t year</HI> a glorious <HI>Victory,</HI> which brought forth good fruit and great effects. And <HI>this</HI> year he hath not been wanting to us. In the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> Fight he brought us off without di&s;ho|nour, nay, perhaps with more honour (the circum&s;tances of the Battle con&s;idered) then a <HI>full</HI> Victory could have challenged, had we been evenly matched. And your Enemies Beha|viour <HI>then</HI> will teach you how to value the Vi|ctory you have <HI>now.</HI> Lord! how did they in|&s;ult and brave it all over <HI>Europe?</HI> How un|able were they to govern them&s;elves, when they pretended to have ma&s;tered <HI>us?</HI> If <HI>Bonefires</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Wit, <HI>French</HI> Brags, and &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> De&s;pondence could have conquer'd us, we had been utterly undone. But now behold how the <HI>Scene</HI> is changed; we have &s;een our Con|querors fairly beaten; and they who lately told the World that the <HI>narrow Seas</HI> were be|come as &s;ubject to them as their own <HI>Ditches,</HI> and talked, as if like <HI>Xerxes,</HI> they would bri|dle and fetter the Captive Ocean, are &s;hame|fully fled like him broken and &s;hatter'd through <HI>tho&s;e</HI> very Seas, and left them to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their ancient rightful owners.
<PB N="XIII" REF="7">And now their countenance is alter'd with their fortune: Heretofore they were like the <HI>Grecian Wra&s;tler,</HI> who being thrown, would &s;pring up nimbly from the ground, and con|fidently aver, that he had given his adver&s;ary the fall. Now they are more ingenuous and mode&s;t, but not more quiet; their Rants and Huffs are exerci&s;ed among them&s;elves: And having by a calm e&s;caped an imminent ruine at Sea, they are &s;haken by Tempe&s;ts and Storms at Land; Revilings and accu&s;ations fly like <HI>Broad&s;ides</HI> among their great Captains, and the <HI>wi&s;e</HI> men cannot make the <HI>valiant</HI> ones agree which of them contributed mo&s;t to their be|ing beaten. That all this hath been done for us, and in a time while the devouring <HI>Pe&s;ti|lence</HI> rageth in our bowels, and kills far more at home, then our Enemies can abroad; That the &s;preading Contagion, which hath &s;eized all quarters of our Land, hath been re&s;trained from hindring our great bu&s;ine&s;s, either in the <HI>Fleet,</HI> the <HI>Court,</HI> or this <HI>City,</HI> is of the won|derful goodne&s;s of God, who though he will cha&s;ti&s;e, will not de&s;troy us, though he take us into his <HI>own</HI> hand to correct us for our a|mendment, yet &s;uffers us not to <HI>fall into the hands of Man,</HI> but both in Judgment and Mer|cy approves him&s;elf our <HI>Strength,</HI> our <HI>Deliverer,</HI> the <HI>horn</HI> of our <HI>Salvation,</HI> and our <HI>high Tower;</HI>
<PB N="XIV" REF="8">and all this, to try us by one experiment more, whether when we have found him as good to us as he was to <HI>David,</HI> we will be as thankful to him as <HI>David</HI> was; <HI>Love</HI> him, <HI>Tru&s;t</HI> in him, <HI>Prai&s;e</HI> him, and <HI>Pray</HI> to him.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Love him.</HI></P>
<P>VVHo can do other then love God, in whom he lives, and moves, and hath his Being? How can we refrain loving that Infinite Wi&s;dom, and Power, and Good|ne&s;s, which hath made the Univer&s;e, and wonderfully di&s;po&s;ed it in a beautiful Harmo|ny, and mutual corre&s;pondence, and doth &s;o &s;weetly govern, and carefully &s;u&s;tain all the parts of it?

Further, To love God for his Be|nefits onely, is but to love our &s;elves, and our own conveniences; to love him as we do fair weather, and &s;weet air; as we love meat, drink, and &s;leep; And the in&s;incerity of &s;uch a love would be &s;ure to appear upon the tryal which Satan de&s;ired to put on <HI>Job:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">J b 1.9, 10, 11.</NOTE> While <HI>God maketh a hedg about its, and ble&s;&s;eth all that we have,</HI>

<P>We are to love God for his own <HI>Excel|lencies;</HI> We are to love him becau&s;e he <HI>re|quires</HI> it; and the more, Becau&s;e having a ju&s;t Right and Power to exact from us the mo&s;t painful hard &s;ervices: He is &s;o gracious, as to demand no more, but that we love him; that we be not &s;o much his <HI>Servants,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">hn 15.15.</NOTE> as his <HI>Friends.</HI> This is our &s;tanding ordinary Duty; Indeed, this is all we can perform; We can do no more then love God; That is both the Perfection of our Obedience here&punc; and &s;hall be of our Happine&s;s in Heaven. But yet this love is capable of degrees; The <HI>affection</HI> may and mu&s;t be at &s;ometimes, and on &s;ome occa|ca&s;ions more inten&s;e then at others, and the <HI>acts</HI> more lively and vigorous, when our hearts are impregnated, and our &s;ervices called forth by &s;ignal extraordinary demon&s;trations as in|&s;tances of Gods love to us.

Imagine our &s;elves &s;ufficient Deliverers and Saviours to our &s;elves, and forgetting that God is our <HI>Strength, The Rock of our Defence, and the Horn of our Sal|vation.</HI> I fear &s;omething of this may have been the Provocation which hath mov'd God to Di&s;cipline us with his own Sword, the Plague, at home, while he &s;aves us from that of the Enemy abroad.
