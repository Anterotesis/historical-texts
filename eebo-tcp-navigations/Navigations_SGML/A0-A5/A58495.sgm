<P>I <HI>Could wi&s;h there was no occa&s;ion for me to di&s;turb my Brains in my Hammock about the Abu&s;es of the Sailors; but they have been of too long a con|tinuance to be born without Re&s;entment: by frequent Complaints the Mi&s;erable often find Mercy; and we are bound to pray, tho Heaven thinks not fit to grant, when we think we &s;tand mo&s;t in need of what we de&s;ire. I don't &s;ay that Navys in former Reigns have been with|out Corruption; but how ea&s;ily have their Grievances been redre&s;s'd? Sir</HI> John Thomp&s;on <HI>in his Preface to the Earl of</HI> Angle&s;ey<HI>'s State of the Government, from</HI> 21 Edw. 3. <HI>N^o</HI> 58. <HI>&s;ays,</HI> The Commons complain, That whereas divers Merchants were &s;lain and rob'd on the Sea by the King's Ene|mies of <HI>France,</HI> they which undertook the Con|duct may be made come into this pre&s;ent Par|liament to make Gree to the Merchants, who by their default have lo&s;t their Goods. To which the King an&s;wers, Let Per&s;ons and Places be ap|pointed for hearing the Plaints of all that will complain, to the end Right and Rea&s;on may be fully done to the Plaintiff. <HI>Sir</HI> John <HI>further adds from the</HI> 45th <HI>of</HI> Edw. 3. <HI>N^o</HI> 31. When the Com|mons affirm the Decay of the Navy to ari&s;e by three Cau&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. For that &s;undry mens
<PB N="iv" REF="3">Ships are &s;taid for the King long before they &s;erve, whereby the Owners are driven at their Charges to find their Mariners to their undoing. 2. For that Merchants, the Nouri&s;hers of the Navy, are often re&s;trained their Shipping; where|by Mariners are driven to &s;eek other Trades and Livings. 3. For that the Ma&s;ters of the King's Ships do take up Ma&s;ters of other Ships as good as them&s;elves are; whereby the mo&s;t of the&s;e Ships do lie &s;till, and the Mariners are enforced to &s;eek new Livings, whereof they pray Reme|dy: The King promi&s;es to provide Remedy. <HI>The&s;e were but</HI> Innocent Grievances <HI>to what ours now are, yet of a far &s;horter continuance.</HI> Q<HI>'s and</HI> R<HI>'s were Letters then unknown to have Power enough to keep Sailors out of their Pay.

<HEAD>REMARKS ON THE Pre&s;ent Condition OF THE NAVY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE mon&s;trous Mi&s;managements in our Naval Affairs, have not only tired the Tongues of Complainers, but the Pens of Writers, in repre&s;enting Grievances of &s;o high a na|ture, and of &s;uch fatal Con&s;equence to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Na|tion. Our Maritime Mi&s;carriages have been the anxious Concern even of the whole Kingdom: They have been the indu&s;trious Care of Parliament, who have un|ravell'd all the My&s;tery of Iniquity, and laid the Com|mon Grievance of the good People of <HI>England</HI> in this point before his Maje&s;ty in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Addre&s;s. Whether that Addre&s;s gave being to the pre&s;ent Commi&s;&s;ion of Admiralty, is not worth our Enquiry: but if Per&s;ons had been puni&s;hed, as well as their Crimes di&s;covered, it might have deterred &s;ucceeding Commi&s;&s;ioners, who now by the Succe&s;s of their Predece&s;&s;ors may be en|couraged to rai&s;e their Fortunes to the ruin of the Kingdom. Vice unpuni&s;hed has a very attractive Virtue in it, and men ea&s;ily tread the Path to Riches, tho ne|ver &s;o wicked, when they &s;ee others pa&s;s with &s;afety be|fore
<PB N="2" REF="4">them. When men have lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of Hone&s;ty and Con&s;cience, what Crimes will they not commit? e&s;pecially &s;uch as can leap over all Fences of Law, or can have recour&s;e to <HI>Noli pro&s;equi's</HI> or Privy Seals. But it &s;eems the Crimes of the late Commi&s;&s;ion of Admiralty are forgiven, tho they'l never be blotted out of the Book of the Peoples remembrance, &s;ince this Age is likely to feel the Effects of their Management. An ill Star has influenc'd our Horizon hitherto, and the Sons of the Sea have been under a fatal Direction. But you &s;ay, Sir, we have a new Commi&s;&s;ion, upon which you de&s;ire my Opinion.</P>
<P>You know it does not much lie in my way to be ac|quainted with Per&s;ons, but Things: I am no Cour|tier, nor never de&s;ire to be one. All the knowledg I have of your Courtiers ari&s;es from the Influence their Management has upon the Publick. If I have an ill piece of work put into my hands, it matters not who made it; he was either ignorant, no Arti&s;t, or a cheat|ing Knave, and con&s;equently not worth my Acquain|tance. You know Men as well as Things, and may ea|&s;ily gue&s;s how they will prove, by their Temper and In|clination, before they come into Office, and by com|paring their Principles with the Principles of tho&s;e whom they &s;ucceed; for if they are ca&s;t in the &s;ame Mould, they'l encline the &s;ame way, and their Manage|ment will produce the &s;ame Effects: If they have no more Hone&s;ty, nor more Skill in Naval Affairs, and are no better Friends to Trade and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Intere&s;t than the others, your new Commi&s;&s;ion is like &s;ome Revolu|tions, an Alteration without a Change; you have only chang'd your Shilling for two Sixpences, and got not one Farthing by the bargain. I could give you a better
<PB N="3" REF="4">account of your new Commi&s;&s;ion, had not your demand been &s;o &s;peedy; for we have &s;carcely yet felt the Influ|ence of our new Ma&s;ters, and hardly know whether it be worth while to drink their Healths. I cannot &s;o well tell you what they are, as I can tell you what they ought to be, which if I &s;hould do, perhaps they'l be angry with me; and therefore, to fight clo&s;e and &s;ure, and avoid the Fire&s;hips of the <HI>Gate-hou&s;e</HI> and <HI>New|gate,</HI> I'll tell you what they ought not to be.</P>
<P>They ought not to be men of &s;lavi&s;h Principles; for we Tarrs &s;ee &s;o much Slavery abroad, and like it &s;o ill, that we &s;hall never endure it at home. No one in the world &s;hall ever per&s;wade me, that a Per&s;on who de|clar'd the Navy of <HI>England</HI> u&s;ele&s;s by voting for a Standing Army, is fit to have the management of it. The very notion of a Standing Army contains in it all the Villanies and Rogueries that ever the World &s;aw; for Slavery, Popery, and all the Devildoms of the Uni|ver&s;e are its in&s;eparable Accidents. Now if this Prin|ciple of a Standing Army is to &s;ucceed the Doctrines of Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience and Non-re&s;i&s;tance, and this mu&s;t &s;erve for a Te&s;t now as the others did in the late Reigns, no man can have a right to an Office, till he has fir&s;t quitted his Right to Liberty. When men of &s;uch Principles are under the influence of the Royal Favour, there needs no Proclamation to tell the methods of ac|quiring an Office.</P>
<P>The&s;e men might &s;urely be contented with the Ad|vantages they receive by trumping up a Standing Army to the ruin of their Country, without reflecting upon others, who endeavour to maintain this Government according to our Con&s;titution, and are not willing to put their Liberties under the Conduct of a Land Force.
<PB N="4" REF="5">'Tis true the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> came over by their Ad|vice, and at their Reque&s;t; and they in requital have ven him three of the mo&s;t potent and flouri&s;hing King|doms of the Univer&s;e, and more Mony to &s;upport him in them than to many of his Predece&s;&s;ors. They brought him over to re&s;tore their Liberties to them, and deliver them from the Slavery of a Standing Army; d'ye think they are now mad, to take up the &s;ame Fet|ters they &s;o lately knockt off? The&s;e men tell us that the Nation cannot be &s;ecure without a Standing Army, and we &s;ay our Liberties are in danger with one; and certain it is a good King will acquie&s;ce with that Se|curity the People provide for their Liberties and the Kingdom: They'l take &s;pecial care in this point; for the Liberties and Rights of the People are more valuable than the Rights and Prerogatives of the Crown. They are born Freemen, and are in actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Rights the fir&s;t minute they draw their Breath, a Title a King as &s;uch cannot have, his Right depending upon the Con&s;ent of a willing People. A King may forfeit and lo&s;e his Crown, and the Regalities thereof may devolve upon the People, as the Legal Centre of all Honour and Digni|ty; but an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-man can never forfeit his Liberty and the Rights he was born to. If he be convicted of High Trea&s;on without the Privilege of <HI>Gavel-kind,</HI> and his E&s;tate becomes confi&s;cate, his Son, notwith&s;tanding this, is Heir to his Liberty and Property, and enjoys all the Privileges of a Freeman: His Cau&s;e is pleadable at Bar in a Court of Ju&s;tice; he mu&s;t be tried by his Peers according to the known Laws of the Realm: So that an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-man can upon no account forfeit his Right. Now the Liberties of the People being &s;o valuable, firm, and la&s;ting, this Government has more rea&s;on to con|&s;ide
<PB N="5" REF="5">in their Security than any heretofore; for this King was brought to the Throne by worthy Patriots, &s;uch as oppos'd the Tyrannies of the late Reigns, and &s;uch as this Government has not made fat and lazy by Offices of Profit and Tru&s;t. The&s;e men are &s;till living, and have nothing but their Liberties to leave to their Children; which being their la&s;t Stake, they'l be &s;ure to manage it well, and not &s;uffer it to be taken a|way by Invaders from abroad, nor by Standing Armies at home.</P>
<P>Indeed the Attempt of &s;ettling a Standing Army &s;up|pos'd the People ea&s;y, and willing to quit their Rights at once; for Standing Armies are contrary to the Con|&s;titution of any Government where the People have the lea&s;t Right. Souldiers are but Badges of Slavery in any Country where they are found; and what is the notion of Guards, but a &s;uppo&s;ition that the People are not able to defend them&s;elves? and if &s;o, they are a Prey to any body. The Mi&s;eries of tho&s;e Countries where Souldiers are, are Arguments to tho&s;e where they are not to keep them out. Like &s;o many Cater|pillars they wa&s;t and de&s;troy the mo&s;t fruitful Provin|ces: They carry a &s;ort of Charm about them, that no|thing pro&s;pers where they come; and even in tho&s;e Countries where they are found &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary, as lately in <HI>England,</HI> they are confounded Evils, and men can hardly di&s;tingui&s;h which is mo&s;t dangerous, the Remedy or the Di&s;ea&s;e. We found our War attended with many Inconveniences be&s;ides our quartering of Souldiers: our Trade and Commerce decay'd, as the Trade of War encrea&s;ed; nay the Heavens them&s;elves &s;eem'd to be angry at us, and be&s;towed one continued Frown upon a ba&s;e and degenerate Age. The Sun (as
<PB N="6" REF="6">if a&s;hamed to behold our Enterprizes) &s;hrowded his Head in thicker Clouds, and denied the favourable Influence of his Beams to an Apo&s;tate Country: Nature with|drew her wonted Bounty from us, and fed us with Fruits as immature as our Actions: The Sea&s;ons alter'd upon us; we knew Summer nor Winter, Spring nor Autumn, any otherwi&s;e than by Men&s;uration of time. What Storms then did we meet with on the Ocean in Sea&s;ons little expected? The whole Cour&s;e of Na|ture &s;eem'd to go Retrograde, as we declin'd from our antient Principles of Virtue and Liberty. But now we have a&s;&s;um'd our pri&s;tine Courage, and the Genius of our Country informs our Parliament; now we have in fome mea&s;ure rid our &s;elves of our Armies, the cau&s;e of our multiplied Cur&s;es, the Heavens &s;mile upon us, the Sea&s;ons of the Year return to their antient Cour&s;e, being all unwilling to cur&s;e a fruitful Land with Barrenne&s;s upon the account of a few Thi&s;tles that &s;tart up in it, and to de&s;troy a brave and glorious Country upon the account of a few ill Men.</P>
<P>I have, Sir, made the larger Digre&s;&s;ion upon this Subject, to vindicate tho&s;e worthy <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentlemen that put down the Army, believing them to be true Friends to us Sailors, in laying a&s;ide the Support of Ar|mies, and tru&s;ting altogether to us; but if you &s;uffer tho&s;e who were for a Land Army to be our Directors and Governours, as they are wholly ignorant of Maritime Affairs, they &s;uperintend us with an envenom'd grudg upon the fore&s;aid account: for the Di&s;pute in your Hou&s;e was not whether an Army was ever u&s;eful, but whether an Army was a better Security to our Kingdom than a Fleet; and the Members of your honourable Hou&s;e knew very well, that of the two Supports pro|pos'd
<PB N="7" REF="6">for your Realm, you ought to chu&s;e the be&s;t, and that you had no occa&s;ion of both when one would &s;erve Now (if I may &s;o &s;ay) we Sailors carrying our point in the Hou&s;e of Commons again&s;t the Souldiers, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be hated by the Army Folk; and if any of the&s;e Army men or but one of them is in your New Commi&s;&s;ion, we are fall'n mo&s;t damnably to Lee-ward, and God knows when we &s;hall fetch up the old Honour and Glory of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Navy.</P>
<P>But I now, Sir, tack about upon your new Com|mi&s;&s;ion, or your new Commi&s;&s;ioners, which you plea&s;e; for take the Office entire, 'tis Lin&s;ey-wool&s;ey, half new, half old; new Commi&s;&s;ioners with all the old Officers. It is perhaps beneath the Dignity of great Per&s;onages to have any knowledg of their own in Naval Affairs, and therefore are forc't to tru&s;t to the Judgment of o|thers. You know, Sir, taking of Minutes, writing a Letter or Order is a mighty piece of Bu&s;ine&s;s not to be left to the Judgment of a new Secretary; 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to have one that &s;erv'd the old Commi&s;&s;ion, el&s;e how &s;hall we &s;teer the old Cour&s;e? for whoever conns the Ship of the Admiralty, the Secretary is always at the Helm; he knows all the Reaches, Buoys and Shelves of the River of Parliament, and knows how to &s;teer clear of 'em all: He is the Spring that moves the Clock-work of the whole Board, the Oracle that is to be con&s;ulted on all Occa&s;ions; he &s;its at the Board behind a great Periwig, peeping thro it like a Rat out of a Butter-firkin, ready to mi&s;repre&s;ent the Ca&s;e of any Complainer, by telling the Commi&s;&s;ioners that he complains out of pre|judice, that he has written or &s;poken again&s;t the late Commi&s;&s;ioners, that he is mad, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and indeed what man in his Wits would endeavour to mend an Ad|mini&s;tration
<PB N="8" REF="7">&s;o corrupt and rotten as ours, or to com|plain of Grievances, when 'tis ju&s;t like flinging of hot Water to windward at Sea, which certainly flies back in your face and &s;calds you?</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable that they follow the Example of the old Commi&s;&s;ioners in that unaccountable whim of ga|zetting all Complaints that are tran&s;mitted to them. If <HI>A. B.</HI> &s;ends them a Letter, can't they de&s;ire <HI>A. B.</HI> to at|tend them, without telling the world the &s;ubject matter of <HI>A. B</HI>'s Letter? <HI>A. B.</HI> knew of it before, and the knowledg of it can be no advantage to any be&s;ides the Party complain'd again&s;t.</P>
<P>You know, Sir, for &s;ome years la&s;t pa&s;t the noi&s;e of an Inva&s;ion has been a nece&s;&s;ary Imagination in our Govern|ment, and has been pre&s;ented to us as a nece&s;&s;ary &s;hooing horn to draw on you know what; for if there be any meaning in it, it mu&s;t be a few more Land-forces, and a great deal more Mony, as if the Children of <HI>England</HI> were but one Remove from Naturals, and willing to make Ducks and Drakes with their Mony, and play it away as Boys do Cherry&s;tones. Had the noi&s;e of an Inva|&s;ion the latter end of la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions been real, and our Inten|tions to prevent it &s;incere, our good Lords of the Ad|miralty would have &s;ent our Fleet from the <HI>Downs</HI> be|fore the 15th of <HI>July.</HI> We have made a fine Summer's Work of it, con&s;idering the great Danger they told us we were in in the Spring. Some of our great Ships have &s;ail'd from the <HI>Medway</HI> to the <HI>Downs,</HI> and from the <HI>Downs</HI> to <HI>Medway:</HI> Over the Water, Ma&s;ter, for a Penny. At this Rate our great Ships may &s;poil the Trade of the Deal-hookers, and our &s;mall Craft be &s;upplant|ed by the King's Frigots. Did they not now give any body time enough to di&s;embark upon our Country?
<PB N="9" REF="7">The Enemy might have come upon our Coa&s;ts, and fa&s;tn'd their Hazers to our Rocks, and tow'd away our I&s;land, and made it a part of the Continent, in &s;o long an Interval betwixt Coun&s;el and Action. We have made but a very indifferent Figure at Sea this year, if we con&s;ider <HI>England</HI> as the mo&s;t Potent Nation of the Uni|ver&s;e in &s;hipping, having Ships enough to beat the whole World twice over, and a good Fleet left for a Re&s;erve into the Bargain. But &s;uch Actions as the&s;e mu&s;t be done by the natural Sons of the Sea, and the manage|ment of the Fleet mu&s;t at &s;uch a time be under the Conduct of men, who&s;e Heads are not cramm'd with Land-Notions, and who would manage Fleets as they do Land-Armies a&s;hoar. And this leads me to di&s;cu&s;s a new Point, the late Notion of Fortifying of Gari&s;ons for Security of our Shipping.</P>
<P>This fortifying of Gari&s;ons to &s;ecure the Fleet, looks &s;o much like intrenching, which for &s;everal Years to|gether in <HI>Flanders</HI> co&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation &s;uch a woun|dy deal of Mony, in Spades, Pickaxes and Wheelbar|rows, that I can't down with it. Such a Notion as this may &s;ute the Governments of <HI>Sally</HI> and <HI>Madaga&s;car</HI> well enough. But the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are yet Ma&s;ters of the Sea, and have no occa&s;ion of a Subterfuge that I know of: Our Guns on board Ship have hitherto been their Defence, without the Auxiliary A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Platforms and Lines. But the la&s;t year we had an Author &s;tarted out with an An&s;wer to all the Books written again&s;t a Standing Army, encourag'd in that pious Work by the Court Party; wherein he tells us, <HI>Pag.</HI> 66. That the <HI>French</HI> from <HI>Stokes-bay</HI> may be able to de&s;troy our Fleet at <HI>Port&s;mouth.</HI> His Subject required &s;omething to be &s;aid of Fleets and Bays; and <HI>Stokes-bay, Soulbay,</HI> or <HI>Torbay</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="8">are the &s;ame to the folk he wrote for. But pray, Mr. Po&s;itive, what &s;ort of Guns mu&s;t the <HI>French</HI> have to de&s;troy our Ships at <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> from <HI>Stokes-Bay?</HI> If you build them a Platform a top of <HI>Gilkicker</HI> or <HI>Stoke-Church,</HI> you may do &s;omething tho you're a woundy way off &s;till: But being a good Pilot, you may perhaps bring them from <HI>Stokes-Bay</HI> into <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> Harbour, not|with&s;tanding they mu&s;t fir&s;t engage the Ca&s;tle; and then entring the Harbour, mu&s;t by the po&s;ition of the Sands fall &s;o near a Platform of Guns on the Starboard &s;ide, that one may fling a Bisket Cake a&s;hoar from the Ship. If they get by here, they next pa&s;s a Ca&s;tle upon the <HI>Point,</HI> and all the <HI>Point</HI> lined with Cannon, and within Musket Shot of the Enemy. Next they have on the Larboard-&s;ide, the whole Gari&s;on of <HI>Go&s;pert,</HI> its Ca&s;tles, Lines, and Platforms to engage; be&s;ides in the mid&s;t of that Harbour a Ca&s;tle and a great many Guns at the Dock. Now, Mr. Infallible Courtier! the <HI>French</HI> are in a very good &s;tation, <HI>Go&s;pert</HI> rakes 'em fore and aft, and <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> peppers their Quarters and Sterns: you have e'en fairly brought them on, how the Devil will you get them off? And pray remember I han't &s;poke one word of <HI>South&s;ea</HI>-Ca&s;tle all this while, which I am &s;ure upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion would have one &s;lap at their Ar&s;es; nay the very Pot-Guns at <HI>Rhyde</HI> would do 'em &s;ome mi&s;chief. Now let the world judg whether the Author of that Book de&s;erv'd 500 <HI>l.</HI> for &s;uch a Notion as this&punc; I dare engage they won't give me half the Mony for my Book, tho it contains plain Truth and matter of Fact, wholly de&s;ign'd for the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>It is evident, that it is none of our Intere&s;t to lock up our Ships in the Che&s;t at <HI>Chatham,</HI> nor to &s;ecure them in the Harbours of <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> or <HI>Plymouth.</HI> Our
<PB N="11" REF="8">Ships were built to keep the Enemies from our Harbours, and not our Gari&s;ons built to defend our Shipping. Our fir&s;t Conte&s;t ought to be upon the Water, where if we are beaten (which I think we &s;han't be under a good Management) and we fly for Refuge to our fortify'd Harbours, the Enemy will hardly follow us thither, for 'tis none of their bu&s;ine&s;s to knock their Heads again&s;t Stone-walls; their bu&s;ine&s;s then is to land upon us and invade us, being well a&s;&s;ured if they can get the Land, the Forts, Gari&s;ons and Ships will come in of cour&s;e. For my part I never que&s;tion'd the Courage of my Brethren the Tarrs, nor their Con&s;tancy and Fidelity to the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation; they can do Won|ders when under a good Management and U&s;age. This Notion of fortifying of Gari&s;ons to &s;ecure Shipping, looks al&s;o as if we were afraid of &s;ome new Imaginary Evil; here is &s;omething &s;tarted up in the room of an Inva&s;ion, the Fears and Jealou&s;ies of our Courtiers grow like Mu&s;hrooms: but I'le &s;ay that for 'em, that they never advance a terrible Goblin but there's Mony in the Tail on't. I hope our doughty Author that encounters and an&s;wers all Mankind, when our Gari&s;ons come to be fortify'd, will be at lea&s;t Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Wren</HI> in the Action; 'tis pity this wonderful Notion of his &s;hould go without a farther Reward.</P>
<P>As the <HI>Sancho Pancha</HI> to this <HI>Quixot,</HI> follows a namele&s;s Squire with a Book about fortifying <HI>Dover</HI> Peer to &s;e|cure the King's Ships: this he &s;ays is a Manu&s;cript of Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI>'s to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> which he found a|mong&s;t &s;ome mouldy Records. Now all the Rea&s;on in this Book is not worth an Egg&s;hel. What can you ga|ther from it? Why this: Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> thought the fortifying of <HI>Dover</HI> Peer a &s;ecurity to Ships of War
<PB N="12" REF="9">in the Days of Queen <HI>Be&s;s,</HI> therefore it is nece&s;&s;ary now. How far this Con&s;equence will hold water I can't tell: But to &s;ay that Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> had a very pitiful Navy, not &s;o good as our fifth and &s;ixth Rates, yet by the Choice of good Commanders &s;he routed and de&s;troyed the Invincible Armado of <HI>Spain,</HI> and therefore we ought to follow the &s;ame Example, is good rea&s;oning, and ad|vantageous to the Realm. We may err in Particulars, but what has been generally acted for the good of the Realm, practi&s;ed and approved by many Ages now extinct, will always hold good, and &s;till be our help. Our Au|thor dos not beg our pardon for not telling us how much Mony it will co&s;t us to clean&s;e <HI>Dover</HI> Peer, how many Loads of Mud are in it, nor whether there is not more Mud there than will cover the whole County of <HI>Kent,</HI> tho he is &s;o civil in his Epi&s;tle to ask Sir <HI>W. Raleighs</HI> par|don for publi&s;hing his Manu&s;cript, tho Sir <HI>Walter</HI> dy'd about 100 years ago. Whence the Devil this humour of crying all things down our Fathers have found u&s;e|ful came, I can't tell; But certainly men were never more out of love with old Things, and the approved Maxims and Ways of our Forefathers than now: How many Fleets have rode in the <HI>Downs</HI> &s;ecure of all Tem|pe&s;ts? tell me how many Ships we lo&s;t there, or have been forc't from their Anchors thence during the War? Now &s;uppo&s;e we had as much Mony in <HI>England</HI> as there is Mud in <HI>Dover</HI> Peer, what advantage would the forti|fying of it be to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Navy? Perhaps we might lo&s;e more Ships in one year in bringing them into the Peer, than have and will be lo&s;t in the <HI>Downs</HI> from the beginning of the World to the Re&s;urrection. If our Author be made Pilot to bring them into the Peer, I'le lay my Cap to a Trunnel that he's hang'd in a Months
<PB N="13" REF="9">time. But what need all the&s;e Projects, the&s;e Chimaera's? who among&s;t us is afraid? For our parts we are not: give us but good Commanders, good Pay, and better Victuals, we defy the Devil and all his Works. Don't you remember what we did at <HI>la Hogue,</HI> we can &s;how you &s;uch another Trick whenever there is occa&s;ion for it. We have abundance of Attempts to &s;et us be&s;ide our true Intere&s;t in Naval Affairs; pray when, Sir, will you give a fair pu&s;h to &s;et us before the Wind for the Honour and Glory of our Country?</P>
<P>Thus I hope I have over&s;et the Vanity of two Authors, tho the de&s;ign of my writing was to &s;how you the Mi&s;carriages of the Navy, the Wrecks they have already made, that you may &s;teer clear of them, and find out e're it is too late &s;ome Method to put us in a right po&s;ture for the defence of your Nation.</P>
<P>I &s;hould in the next place proceed to the Navy Office, and give you an Account of the hard U&s;age of the Sailors there; the impious Method of buying their Tickets, of keeping them out of their Pay upon the ac|count of <HI>Q</HI>'s and <HI>R</HI>'s &s;et upon their names in the Navy-Books; and the abominable Practices of the Officers of the Pay-Office, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But another Method is taken to in|form your Honourable Hou&s;e of their Grievances.</P>
<P>I could al&s;o inlarge upon the abominable Practice of pre&s;&s;ing the Seamen for the Service, and &s;how how in|con&s;i&s;tent it was with the rights of a freeborn People. Indeed the abu&s;es of the Sailors are &s;o many and &s;o great, that a man knows not where to begin or end.</P>
<P>Perhaps, Sir, you never heard of &s;uch an Office as Slop-&s;eller to his Maje&s;ty's Navy, and therefore I mu&s;t acquaint you with the Original of that Office. A cer|tain Per&s;on in K. <HI>C.</HI> the 2d's time got in with one of
<PB N="14" REF="10">the Royal Whores, and &s;he got him a Patent to be Slop|&s;eller to his Maje&s;ty's Navy, which is as much as to &s;ay &s;he got him empowered by the King's Sign Manual to cheat all his Sailors; for no Slops were to be &s;ent on Board, and &s;old to the Sailors, but what belong'd to this Per&s;on; at this rate he got at lea&s;t 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Now this Patent is &s;till in force, and the Seamen under this Government have met with the &s;ame U&s;age. This has been the general Complaint of the Sailors of the whole Navy; but the Officers of the Navy finding it profitable to them&s;elves, have &s;till &s;upported the Cheat: For the Slop&s;eller allows 12<HI>d.</HI> in the Pound to the Pay-Office for &s;topping the Slop-Mony at the Pay-Table. If you plea&s;e ('tis very ea&s;y) to examine the Books of the Pay-Office upon this Account, you'l find that the Poun|dage receiv'd in that Office upon this and the Account of Tobacco, amounts to about 80 Thou&s;and pound during the la&s;t War.</P>
<P>Let us now de&s;cend to the Victualling, the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t corrupt Office of the Navy. The Cure of the Navy is done but by halves; for tho the Head may be eas'd by Cephalick Medicins, yet if the lower Region of the Sto|mach be infected, its noxious and poi&s;onous Vapours will a&s;cend and affect the Brain. This is the Condition of our Navy. The Head is only &s;haven to prevent the Frenzy: without Bloodletting and other nece&s;&s;ary Appli|cations to effect a Cure, the whole Body labours under an ill Habit, which, till remov'd, our Ships Rudders will hardly cut water, and our Ships, the Walls of our I&s;land, will be a weak Defence, and their Cannon as in|&s;ignificant as &s;o many Squibs or Crackers. From the Votes of your Hou&s;e the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions by the Admiralty, I &s;pell the whole Affair of the Navy; the Victualling
<PB N="15" REF="10">and Navy Offices being rather con&s;tituent parts than dependent Offices upon it: and I thought that your Votes condemning the ill Practices of one, had &s;uppos'd all the re&s;t; that this was as clearly under&s;tood as if it had been verbally expre&s;t; that &s;ince you were over Shoes, there was no occa&s;ion of your being over Boots too in the <HI>Augean</HI> Stable of the Navy; and that there was a little nece&s;&s;ity for you to &s;tir a thing that already &s;tank over the whole Kingdom. I hop'd the general Re|&s;entment of our Repre&s;entatives in Parliament carried &s;uch a force in it, that the thing re&s;ented had no need of Retro&s;pection. I little thought to have heard of any more Complaints, or to have imploy'd my Pen any more on this Subject: But we &s;till labouring under the &s;ame Mi&s;managements and Admini&s;tration, I &s;hall with Fidelity inform you of the pa&s;t and pre&s;ent State of the Victualling; which Hints, I hope, by your greater Wi&s;dom may be improv'd to an effectual Redre&s;s.</P>
<P>I told you the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions the Qualifications of tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners; and methinks it is great pity, that &s;o many worthy Patriots as brought his Maje&s;ty to the Throne, Men valuable for their Parts and Skill in Bu|&s;ine&s;s, &s;hould want Imployments, and his Maje&s;ty be fore't to pick up a Journyman Apothecary, one that was hir'd at 50 <HI>s. per men&s;em</HI> Surgeon of a Ship to the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> upon the Revolution, to be a Commi&s;&s;ioner in that Office. But how much &s;oever Men of Merit and Worth are neglected it matters not, provided our Country and Government were well &s;erv'd, which cannot be done by ill men, that have neither Hone&s;ty nor Sen&s;e.</P>
<P>When men are e&s;tabli&s;hed Commi&s;&s;ioners, what is their fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s? If they have bought their Places, then they mu&s;t do &s;omething to make good their Pur|cha&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="11">cha&s;e Mony; they mu&s;t get &s;omething to live at a great rate; they mu&s;t provide &s;omething for their Childrens Portions; they mu&s;t lay by &s;omething to make their Peace, when they are found tardy; and they mu&s;t re|&s;erve &s;omething to live upon when they are old; and after all their Somethings, 'tis ten to one if the People have any thing left be&s;ides Taxes. Now the Victual|lers having nothing allow'd them be&s;ides their Salaries, they mu&s;t find out &s;omething too for them&s;elves; and &s;ince they have no Perqui&s;ites, they mu&s;t make &s;ome. Upon this account they &s;eiz'd to their own u&s;e the Boards-Ends in the Cooperidg, which Boards Ends are pieces &s;aw'd off from the Pipe-Staves, when they are cut into equal Lengths to make the Cask. The&s;e Boards-Ends were formerly &s;old for the King's advantage, and were &s;ometime the Perqui&s;ite of the Ma&s;|ter Cooper when the Victualling was in Contract. The large&s;t of the&s;e Boards-Ends will &s;erve to make Buckets for the Navy's u&s;e, the &s;horter to make Canns, and the lea&s;t may be &s;old to Bru&s;h and Hourgla&s;s makers. In|deed the Boards-Ends them&s;elves are a great lo&s;s to the King, but the lo&s;s is much advanced by the manner of &s;ecuring them to the Commi&s;&s;ioners u&s;e; every Com|mi&s;&s;ioner but one having a Labourer appointed for that Service, and paid out of the Nations Pocket. The&s;e Labourers are not under the Check and Command of the Officers of the Yards; their Bu&s;ine&s;s is to carry in their Fardel of Boards-Ends to their Commi&s;&s;ioners, and then their day's Service is over. And if at any time their Complement of Boards-Ends falls &s;hort, then they &s;aw the new Staves to pieces to make Ends. Mr. <HI>John Bridgar,</HI> the Over&s;eer of the Cooperidg, once found a Labourer at this piece of Service, and immediately di&s;|charged
<PB N="17" REF="11">him; upon which the Commi&s;&s;ioner made his life unea&s;y by an inveterate grudg upon this Account, and at la&s;t made his Office u&s;ele&s;s; and though the Per|&s;on he di&s;charged was for &s;ome time out of Service, the Commi&s;&s;ioners as a Reward of his Iniquity, prefer'd him to a much better Emyloyment in the Cutting-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t here upon the &s;mall Perqui&s;ites of Beef and Pork, the common Provi&s;ion for their Fa|milies; nor on the deplorable Condition of the King's Bavin-&s;tack torn to pieces by the&s;e Mi&s;creants, from which 100 in a week have been carried into two of the Commi&s;&s;ioners Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Another of their Perqui&s;ites is the Ox-Tongues, which formerly were di&s;tributed to the Ships of War in number according to the Proportion of Provi&s;i|ons the Ship received: To every 160 pieces of Beef (each Ox, one with the other, being computed to make &s;o many pieces) was allowed a Tongue: But now the Ships have allow'd according to their Rates what number of Tongues the Commi&s;&s;ioners plea&s;e, which Tongues they receive once a Year; the Over|plus of Tongues, which is very con&s;iderable, falling to their own Di&s;po&s;al. At <HI>Chri&s;tma&s;s</HI> the Lords of the Trea&s;ury and their Officers have &s;o many; the Lords of the Admiralty &s;o many, Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy &s;o many, of the Victualling the re&s;t; be&s;ides each a <HI>Quo|ta</HI> of Marrow-bones. Thus the&s;e kind Creatures make Pre&s;ents to one another out of the publick Stock of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>This Office has followed the Example of mo&s;t Offices in the Kingdom, in &s;tifling &s;uch Complaints as have been brought again&s;t their Officers; and with good Rea&s;on too, for the little Thieves are privy to the Embezle|ments
<PB N="18" REF="12">of the great ones; and no Puni&s;hers are found when all men are guilty. We mu&s;t make no Prece|dents of this Nature; thus the whole Axle-Tree of our Offices would crack, and the &s;etting of a &s;mall Star would be portentous of a black Night among&s;t them. Time has been when the Victuallers have prefer'd one of their Creatures &s;oon after a Complaint again&s;t him for drinking K. <HI>James</HI>'s Health, and have pardon'd another upon his Confe&s;&s;ion of Embezlements. But of this I have &s;poke more at large in another Book, as of their buying and &s;elling to the Office; &s;o that I &s;hall no farther urge what has been in&s;i&s;ted on already, but &s;hall leave it to the Con&s;ideration of your Honourable Hou&s;e how far detrimental it mu&s;t be to the Nation to have Officers buy of the King, and &s;ell to the King at their own Price; and whether this &s;ort of Practice has not been a main Cau&s;e of the Deficiency of our Funds? The va&s;t E&s;tates got by Per&s;ons receiving &s;mall Salaries in that Office, are evident proofs of the &s;ini&s;ter ways by which &s;uch E&s;tates have been acquired.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners and Officers, by making Intere&s;t for their Friends to &s;ell in Provi&s;ions, have too often been the Occa&s;ion of bad Provi&s;ions being brought into the Stores; for when Goods are bought by favour and affection, the Quality of the Commodity is not con|&s;idered, but the Gratuity given the Officer is the prin|cipal Verb. By this means the Victualling was a long time &s;upply'd with Bread made of undue Mixtures, as Hor&s;e-Beans, Pea&s;e, Rye, Barley, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Nay damag'd Pea&s;e have been bought out of the Office, afterwards dry'd over the Bakers Ovens, ground into Flower, Bread made of it, and &s;old into the Office at the &s;ame price as if made of all Wheat. The&s;e mixtures pa&s;t a long time
<PB N="19" REF="12">in the Office, to the Advantage both of the Buyer and Seller; but God knows very little to the Advantage of the poor Sailors, who dy'd by Thou&s;ands in <HI>Nevil</HI>'s Squadron in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> This Practice was known to, and countenanced by the Commi&s;&s;ioners, but no &s;top put to it till Mr. <HI>Kelly</HI> a Bisket-Baker mov'd in that point, when &s;ome of the Bread was left upon the Bakers hands; and being merchantable only with the King, they knew not how to di&s;po&s;e of it, and there|fore apply'd them&s;elves to others who had Intere&s;t e|nough to pa&s;s it into the Office, who bought it of them. I could tell you the Names of the Per&s;ons who|bought this &s;ophi&s;ticated Bread, and &s;old it into the Office; but they being Members of your own Hou&s;e, I mu&s;t forbear. I could tell you al&s;o of another that &s;ells Wheat to the King, and far from being the be&s;t, at the be&s;t price; and of another that &s;ells Flower to the Office for Sea-Service, which after the Labourers have broken the Lumps in it, is bak'd into Coar&s;e Bread. Perhaps you never yet heard in a former Par|liament, when <HI>Wright</HI> the Purveyor was accu&s;ed as hav|ing got a prodigious E&s;tate in the Victualling, and ex|cus'd by Sir <HI>Rob. Rich,</HI> that Sir <HI>Robert</HI> at that time &s;old him Oxen. You cannot tell, Sir, the many pretty ways we have of obliging &s;ome &s;ort of People. 'Tis true we Tarrs only feel the Effect of this Management; we only at pre&s;ent are gut-founder'd and poi&s;on'd: But the&s;e Storms at Sea may in time reach the Land, your lofty Turrets and &s;tately Edifices may feel the fury of the Storm, which may level you into a Condition e|qual with our &s;elves. For how can your antient Con|&s;titution, the old and approv'd Laws of the Realm, &s;ub&s;i&s;t under &s;uch perpetual Lopping? for every Mem|ber
<PB N="20" REF="13">thus corrupted is a Bough cut off from the Tree of your Con&s;titution, which &s;uffering &s;uch Amputati|ons, will in time wither and &s;hrivel to nothing. If you do not re&s;train your own Members, who &s;hall &s;et Bounds to the Multitude? When &s;uch as &s;hould be Pa|trons of our Liberties, and Examples of Ju&s;tice and Hone&s;ty to others, are corrupted by evil and &s;ini&s;ter Re|wards, they &s;tagger the People of the whole Realm; the&s;e men break down a whole Pole of the Hedg at once, and leave a Gap for thou&s;ands to follow them.</P>
<P>But before I leave this Head, I mu&s;t tender you one Cake more of Hor&s;e-Bean Bisket, which certainly mu&s;t &s;tick upon any man's Stomach endow'd with common Principles of Humanity; which is the Lives of many Thou&s;ands of Sailors lo&s;t upon this account, the mean|e&s;t of which did more Service to his Country, than all the Mi&s;creants that fed them with corrupted Food; they are dead and gone, and their Service to their Country is quite lo&s;t: all you can do is to prevent the like for the future; which I wi&s;h were done for the common Good of the Realm.</P>
<P>But getting of E&s;tates, and not getting whol&s;om Provi&s;ions for the Sailors, has been the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Victualling. A certain Per&s;on might well enough &s;tick in the Skirts of Admiral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> about the Mony Impre&s;ted to the Admiral for victualling in the <HI>Straits;</HI> this Mo|ny was diverted out of the proper Channel of the Victu|alling, and the other lo&s;t twice as much as the Admiral got by that Bargain, for otherwi&s;e the Mony had pa&s;s'd thro his Hands; and you know, Sir, the Nations Mo|ny will &s;tick to the Officers fingers. This Gentleman needed no ways and means of getting Mony, for every body mu&s;t acknowledg it a comfortable Importance,
<PB N="21" REF="13">for a man to be chief Commi&s;&s;ioner of an Office, and his Son the Trea&s;urer; for the one to order Payments, and the other to make them, e&s;pecially in an Office that al|ways paid out of Cour&s;e, as the Victualling has done.</P>
<P>I cannot forbear mentioning one practice in the Vic|tualling, which I think very inva&s;ive on the Liberty of the Subject, which is, their &s;elling of Protections to freeborn <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-men; the Labourers and Workmen being fir&s;t to take Protections from their Secretary at 12 <HI>d.</HI> apiece to &s;ecure them from the Pre&s;s. The Laws of our Land &s;ay no man &s;hall be kept in durance with|out Cau&s;e of Action; and an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-man has a native Right to his Liberty, and is upon no Account to be under Con&s;traint but by power of Law: Now for the&s;e men to &s;ell an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-man that Right he is born to, makes our Government look more like that of <HI>Algiers,</HI> than the Country of a free and independent People. We have a fine Revolution indeed if we are forc't to purcha&s;e our Freedom from tho&s;e that are in our Pay, and wear our Livery. If you &s;uffer the&s;e men to &s;ell our Liberties for a Shilling, they'l in a little time &s;ell your Country for a Song.</P>
<P>Had the Commanders of our Navy taken no more Care of their Hounds, than the Victuallers have done of their Sailors, we &s;hould have had as great a Mortali|ty among&s;t the Dogs as we had among&s;t the Men. This is another abu&s;e upon the Sailors and Nation, to have a Kennel of Hounds aboard Ship to eat up the Sailors Victuals; and the Folk in <HI>Spain</HI> could think you no otherwi&s;e than hair brain'd, to &s;end a parcel of Hunt&s;men Commanders of the Fleet. This was a Dog|trick put upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> poor Sailors, who in&s;tead of hand|ling of Sails, and hawling the main Tack aboard, were
<PB N="22" REF="14">imploy'd in that pretty Diver&s;ion of looking after Hounds: It was one man's bu&s;ine&s;s at lea&s;t, to fling the Bones over board when the Captain's Dogs had din'd. And who victuall'd the Captain's Poultry, his Sheep, Hogs, <HI>&amp;c?</HI> The&s;e were never born upon the Pur&s;ers Book, and yet they had Provi&s;ions when the poor Sai|lors wanted it.</P>
<P>And now, Sir, I have given you a &s;hort View of the Condition of the Navy: do you think under &s;uch a Management it will ever an&s;wer your Ends, or be that &s;ecurity to the Realm your Honourable Hou&s;e has propo&s;ed? I endeavoured the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions, in my Sea|mans Opinion of a &s;tanding-Army, to &s;hew that the Navy of <HI>England</HI> was our be&s;t and chief &s;ecurity; I am of the &s;ame Opinion &s;till, but mu&s;t needs &s;ay it can never be &s;o under this Management. Our Forefa|thers found the Advantage of their Shipping, tho made but of Wicker and Hydes; and I hear our old Sailors often talk of one K. <HI>Edgar,</HI> that u&s;ed in a great Navy of the&s;e Frigots to coa&s;t upon this I&s;land every Year, by which means he kept his Kingdom in Peace, which before was almo&s;t every year invaded by Foreigners. Certainly our Fleet is of more advantage to us, and a greater &s;ecurity to our I&s;land than Foreign Alliances; The native &s;trength of our Kingdom, which never yet fail'd us, will always be a better Support to us than any Auxiliary Prop can be. Auxiliaries may as well offend as defend us. Mercenaries &s;erve tho&s;e mo&s;t that pay them be&s;t. But Nature has plac'd our Country by it &s;elf, contiguous to no part of the World; and as we &s;tand by our &s;elves, we ought to be our &s;elf-defenders &s;ince we are capable of being &s;o. But if we'l incapa|citate our &s;elves, by letting our Shipping, the Bulwarks
<PB N="23" REF="14">of the Kingdom, run to ruin, we mu&s;t feel the Effects of our own Folly. We have but one Security left us, and like unthinking Sinners, we neglect the one Thing needful. We have but one &s;ort of People among&s;t us, I mean our Sailors, that are our con&s;tant and ready help, and tho&s;e we abu&s;e after a mo&s;t barbarous and inhuman manner. Are the&s;e the grateful Returns of our Country to Men that have done us the mo&s;t &s;ingu|lar Services? Are the&s;e the Rewards of Valour and Bra|very? Are the Sons of the Briti&s;h Seas thus requited for their good Services to their Country? Tell it not in <HI>Gath,</HI> publi&s;h it not in the Streets of <HI>Askalon!</HI> Let not the Heathen World be acquainted with our Shame! Tell not how our young men have fallen, not by the Sword and de&s;troying Bullets, but by bad Provi&s;ions and noi|&s;om Scents! Let not our infamous Annals be handed down to Po&s;terity, but draw a Sable Curtain over our Enterprizes, to hide them from the view of &s;ucceeding Ages! Let our Maritime Affairs be buried in the Bottom of the Deep, and their Memory in eternal Silence! 'Tis too hard a Turn of Fate to be the &s;candalous Wonder of this, and of future Ages. If you have any love, Sir, for your Country! if you have any kindne&s;s for the be&s;t con&s;tituted Government in the World! if you have any Bowels of Pity for your Children that are to &s;ucceed you, employ your Intere&s;t to revive the Credit of our &s;inking Navy; otherwi&s;e your antient E&s;tates may in time be the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of men of a &s;trange Lan|guage, who &s;hall di&s;turb the peaceful Urns of your noble Progenitors, and not carry your Children away Captives, but make them Slaves upon their own Free|holds.</P>
