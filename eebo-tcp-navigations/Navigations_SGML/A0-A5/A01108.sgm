<HI>I can tell;</HI> and for the re&s;t I referre them to mine owne Iournall: For I hope it may &s;atisfie tho&s;e that are indifferent, and that &s;tand well affected to tho&s;e Di&s;covering enterpri&s;es, for who&s;e cau&s;e and the good or content of others it was chiefly compiled. I doe confe&s;&s;e, that they have not done me much ami&s;&s;e in cau&s;ing me to &s;how my &s;elfe; for hereby they &s;hall know, that before this vndertaking I was not ignorant of what my predece&s;&s;ors had done before I came, which was no &s;mall helpe both to my &s;afety and proceeding. For &s;ome will Calumniate out of malice, &s;ome for that they di&s;like all things but what them&s;elves or friends doth; but I hope the judiciall Sea-man will &s;tand in my defence: For amongst tho&s;e inqui&s;itors, e&s;pecially the never-&s;atisfied-curious, I finde few that doth or will know what they inquire after, other having other im|ployments re&s;ts content with the verball Report of their owne Times, rather than looke after the La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 span"> and Experiences of &s;o vnplea&s;ant, and as it is held vnprofitable a Voyage.

<P>It will be obiected, that many of the&s;e Ab&s;tracts are taken out of other Bookes, and that tho&s;e are the Voyages of other men; I an&s;wer it is true, the mo&s;t of them are.

is much that never came in Print as yet, being very difficult to be had. And though I have ab&s;tracted tho&s;e Workes of my Predece&s;|&s;ors, yet I have interlaced my owne experience, and beene curious not to leave out any thing of theirs or my owne, wherein I could thinke my remembrance might avayle thee. And although wee all have &s;ometimes &s;tumbled, yet wee may bee excu&s;ed, con&s;idering the long and &s;trange Iourney wee had to goe, and who followeth doth but per&s;evere by our example, nor have I like the Poet feig|ned a Storme where I had none: Nor doe I hold that man fit to take charge of Voyages remote, e&s;pecially Northea&s;t or We&s;tward, and be Ignorant of tho&s;e Ab&s;tracts and Iournals following. For I know, knowledge will conceive them to be good Preparatives. How|&s;oever in them I have done my be&s;t, and who&s;oever will amend them, I &s;hall take him for my friend, I have re&s;tored all the names of Capes, Headlands, and Ilands formerly given by Captaine <HI>DA|VIS,</HI> Mr <HI>HVDSON,</HI> and Sir <HI>THOMAS BVTTON,</HI> (which &s;ince have beene infringed vpon) vnto their fir&s;t appellations, both in my Booke and Map.

Moone and Starres for long &s;ea&s;on, they will then thinke that they onely dreamed before, when they imagined of the Cour&s;e of the Seas, and that their Bookes were but weake Schoolema&s;ters, that the talke of Art were farre &s;hort of the Practice, when at beholding the Starres which they thought to have v&s;ed as guides and directions&punc; &s;eeme now as they threatned their ruine and de&s;truction; nay, when you &s;hall looke forth and tremble at the ri&s;ing of every wave, and &s;hall be aga&s;t with feare to refraine tho&s;e Rockes and dangers which lye hid within the Seas faire&s;t bo&s;ome, together with the greatne&s;&s;e of the Ocean, and &s;malne&s;&s;e of their Ship; for want of experience to handle, not knowing how to &s;hun, they will then thinke that the lea&s;t gale is of force to overthrow them, and know that Art mu&s;t be taught to practice by long and indu&s;trious v&s;e. For it is not enough to be a Sea-man, but to be a painefull Sea-man; for a Sea|bred man of rea&s;onable Capacity, may attaine to &s;o much Art as may &s;erve to Circle the Earths Globe about, but the other wanting the experimentall part cannot&punc; for I doe not allow any to be a good Sea man, that hath not vndergone the mo&s;t Offices about a Ship, and that his youth hath bin both taught and inured to all labours; for to keepe a warme Cabbin &amp; lye in &s;heets, is the mo&s;t ignoble part of a Sea man, but to endure and &s;uffer; as a hard Cabbin, cold and &s;alt Meate, broken &s;leepes, mould bread, dead beere, wet Cloathes, want of fire, all the&s;e are within board; be&s;ides Boate, Lead, Top|yardes, Anchor-morings and the like.

<P>Now when they had rowed a good way from the &s;hore <HI>Pierce</HI> fainted, and could rowe no more: then was <HI>Motter</HI> dri|ven to &s;tand in the Boats head and wave to the Ship, which at fir&s;t &s;awe them not; and when they did, they could not tell what to make of them, but in they &s;tood for them, and &s;o tooke them up. <HI>Greene</HI> was throwne into the Sea, the re&s;t was taken into the Ship, the Salvage being yet alive, but without &s;ence.

<P>The poore number that was left was to ply the Ship to and againe in the mouth of the Straits, for there was no ancho|ring; and be&s;ides, they were to goe in the Boat to kill Fowle to bring them home, which they did with great danger; for if the winde blew, there was an high Sea: and the Eddie of the tide would carry the Ship &s;o neere the Rocks, as it feared the Ma&s;ter, for &s;o now they call By lot.</P>
<P>After which great labour, and on the South Cape they had killed 300.

<P>They lie a trye all night, and the next day the fogge conti|nues, they &s;eeke for ground to anchor in, but found none un|der 100. Fathoms.

<P>He &s;aith that after they were cleare of tho&s;e Ilands which lie out with two points, one on the South Ea&s;t, and the other on the North, making a Bay to the &s;ight, as if there were no way through, hee continued his cour&s;e Ea&s;t South Ea&s;t, and South Ea&s;t, thinking to rai&s;e de&s;olations, from thence to &s;hape his cour&s;e from <HI>Ireland,</HI> though <HI>Ivet</HI> per&s;waded to goe for <HI>New-found-land,</HI> hoping there to have reliefe among&s;t our Countrymen: but in Latitude 57. degrees, the winde came South We&s;t, and &s;o it was thought fit to &s;eek for food where &s;ome grew: <HI>viz Ireland,</HI> and &s;o the cour&s;e was directed; In which time they were fain to frie their Fowles bones in Can|dle<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fowles Bones fryed for meate.</NOTE> tallow, putting vinegar thereto which was &s;tirred a|mong&s;t them, and every man had one pound of Candles al|lowed for one weeke as a great dainty.

<P>It was fir&s;t proved to his face by <HI>Bennet Mathew,</HI> our Trum|peter,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Inets</HI> mutinies.</NOTE> upon our fir&s;t &s;ight of Island: and hee confe&s;t that hee &s;uppo&s;'d that in the account would bee man-&s;laughter, and prove bloody to &s;ome.</P>
<P>Secondly, at our comming from Island, in the hearing of the company, hee did threaten to turne the Ship head home, from the action, which at that time was wi&s;ely pacefied by the Ma&s;ter, in hope of amendment.</P>

<P>What I received from Sir <HI>Thomas Roe,</HI> was an Ab&s;tract co|py taken out of Sir <HI>Thomas Buttons</HI> owne Iournall, being at his returne to this <HI>Hopes Checkt,</HI> and not before: As from the beginning of his Voyage, or his wintring. I have nothing but by report, and thus he proceeded from thence.</P>
<P>15. This day being there he plyed up with contrary winds, and fogg having diver&s;ity of depth, altogether &s;tanding Ea&s;t|wards of &s;ometimes to 30. Faddome and more, and &s;tanding in to 7. or 6 m. thus travercing and anckoring, untill the 23. day, finding the Tyde to come from N.

<P>23 Having thus plyed up to the N.

<P>24. This morning proved thick ea&s;ie winde, and it fell to lighten and thunder, &s;o as hee held it not fit to adventure the Boat from the Ship.</P>
<P>25. He &s;tood of from midnight until this day 10. leagues N. E. by N. to anchor: but he &s;aith the winde was N. E. by N. the ground was more even in &s;tanding off, and on then before, he &s;tood off 4. leagues more into 87. Fathom.</P>
<P>This evening at the Sunnes &s;etting, he took him with two &s;everall In&s;truments, and found him to goe downe 33. d. to

<P>From this noone untill midnight he &s;tood N. E. by N. 18. leagues with much winde and goowne Sea.</P>
<P>From midninght being in 15. fathoms: the weather hazy, the winde S. W. he &s;tood off N.

About 6. this morning hee gave order to take in his Skiffe; the weather clearing, he &s;aw land N. and by E. about 5. leagues off, and was as the other land that hee la&s;t &s;awe &s;omething higher; and having edged in with the land, from this mor|ning 6. untill noone, the land was N.

<P>From noone untill 6. in the evening, he &s;teered E. one point without the land 4. leagues; at 6. he anchored 32. fathom. It was then &s;lake water; for at 8. came a &s;trong &s;et from N. by E. at 11, the winde S. S. W. and blew much, hee weighed and &s;tood away N. E. with his Fore and Mi&s;ion Sayles.</P>
<P>28 At midnight he put out all &s;ayles and &s;tood N. E. away 4. leagues, untill morning 4, having depth then 73. fathom, he edged in N. and N. and by E. upon that tyre, hee found the night before, and runne from this morning 4. untill noone, 6. leagues N &s;omewhat Ea&s;terly.</P>
<P>This noone with bould winde S. he loo&s;t up for the &s;hore<NOTE PLACE="marg">Not certayne whether flood or ebbe at this time.</NOTE> to get an oppertunity, if po&s;&s;ibly, to &s;end his Boat on land to have found which had beene the flood, and which the ebbe: but when he came within 2. leagues of &s;hore, hee found the Bay all broken ground, and the Sea full of breaches a good

In this place it is a Bay full of &s;mall Iles neere the &s;hore under the high land; and as he rode bore on him N. N. E. Ea&s;terly, and S.

<P>29. From midnight untill 3. this morning, he lay on Hull, having the water &s;o &s;hoald, and at 3. the weather clearing a little with the increa&s;e of the daylight, hee &s;aw land from the E. by S. to the N.

<P>VVOrthy Sir, there needs no filling a Iournall or &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e with Preamble circum&s;tance or comple|ment; and therefore I will onely tell I am proud of my re|membrance, when I expre&s;&s;e your worth to my capacity; and gal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> of any good fortune, when I can avoyde the im|putation of ingratitude, by acknowledgeing your many favours; and &s;eeing it is not unknowne to your Wor&s;hip in what e&s;tate the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e concerning the North We&s;t hath beene heretofore; and how the onely hope was in &s;earching <HI>Fretum Davis;</HI> which if your &s;elfe had not beene the more forward, the Action had wel-nigh beene left of. Now it remaineth for your Wor&s;hip to know what hath beene performed this yeare; wherefore I intreat you to ad|mit of my cu&s;tome, and pardon me if I take the plaine high|way in relating the particulars without u&s;ing any refined Phra&s;es, or eloquent &s;peeches.</P>
<P>Therefore briefly thus, and as it were in the Fore-front I entred to &s;hew the whole proceeding of the Voyage in a word, as namely, there is no Pa&s;&s;age nor hope of Pa&s;&s;age in the North of <HI>Davis</HI> Straight. Wee having coa|&s;ted all, or neere all the Circumference thereof, and finde it to be no other then a great Bay, as the Voyage doth truely &s;how: therefore I cannot but much admire the worke of the Almighty, when I con&s;ider how vaine the be&s;t and chiefe&s;t hopes of men are in things uncertaine; and to &s;peake of no other matter than the hopefull pa&s;&s;age to the North We&s;t. How many of the be&s;t &s;ort of men have &s;et their whole endeavours to proove a pa&s;&s;age that way? not onely in their Conference, but al&s;o in writing and pub|li&s;hing the Worke: Yea what great &s;ummes of money ha|ving beene &s;pent about the Action, as your Wor&s;hip hath co&s;tly experience of?

And for mine owne part I would hardly have beleeved the contrary, untill my eyes became witne&s;&s;es of that I de&s;ired not to have found, &s;till taking occa&s;ion of hope on very likeli|hood till &s;uch time as wee had coa&s;ted almo&s;t all the Cir|cumference of this great Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">.

<P>Now that the wor&s;t is knowne concerning this Pa&s;|&s;age; it is nece&s;&s;ary and requi&s;ite your Wor&s;hip &s;hould under&s;tand what probability and hope of profit might here bee made hereafter, if the Voyage might bee at|tempted by fitting men.

would have made three Ships a &s;aving Voyage; and that it is of that &s;ort of Whales, there is no feare, I being twice at <HI>Greeneland,</HI> tooke &s;ufficient notice to know them a|gaine, be&s;ides a dead Whale wee found at Sea, having all her Finnes: or rather all the Roughs of her mouth; of which with &s;mall labour wee got a hundred and &s;ixty the &s;ame evening wee found her: and if fowle weather the next day had not followed, no doubt wee had got all, or the mo&s;t part of them: But the winde and Sea ri&s;ing, &s;hee broke from us, and wee were forced to leave her. Neither are they onely to bee looked for in Whale Sound, but al&s;o in <HI>Smiths</HI> Sound, <HI>Wol&s;tenholmes</HI> Sound, and o|thers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>For the killing of Sea-mors I can give no certainty, but onely this: that our Boate being but once a &s;hoare in all the North part of this Bay, which was in the en|trance of Alderman IONES his Sound; at their re|turne our Men told us they &s;awe many Mors along by the &s;hoare on the Ice: but our Ship being under &s;ayle, and the winde comming faire, they pre&s;ently came on board without further &s;earch; be&s;ides the people inhabiting about 74. degrees&punc; tould us by divers &s;ignes, that towards the North there were many of tho&s;e Bea&s;ts having two long teeth; and &s;hewed us divers pieces of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>As for the Vnicorne, it being a great Fi&s;h, having a long horne borne growing forth of his forehead or no|&s;trils (&s;uch as Sir MARTIN FROBISHER in his &s;econd Voyage found one) in divers places wee &s;ee of them: which if the horne be of any good value, no doubt but many of them maybe killed.</P>
<P>As concerning what the &s;hoare will yeeld, as Beares skins, Mors teeth, and &s;uch like; I can &s;ay little, becau&s;e we came not on Land in any of tho&s;e places where hope was of finding them.</P>
<P>But here &s;ome may object why wee &s;ought that Coa&s;t no better? To this I an&s;were, that while&s;t we were there|abouts, the weather was &s;o exceeding fowle wee could not; for fir&s;t wee anchored in <HI>Wol&s;tenholmes</HI> Sound, where pre&s;ently wedrove with two anchors on head, then we were forced to &s;tand forth with a low &s;ayle; the next day in
<PB N="152" REF="74">
Whale Sound we lo&s;t Anchor and Cable, and could fetch the place no more; then wee came to Anchor neere a &s;mall Iland, being betweene Sir <HI>Thomas Smiths</HI> Sound, and Whales Sound: but the winde came more outward, that wee were forced to weigh againe. Neverthele&s;&s;e, if we had beene in a good Harbor, having but our Ships Boat we dur&s;t not &s;end her farre from the Ship, having &s;o few men as 17. in all, and &s;ome of them very weake: but the chiefe cau&s;e why wee &s;pent too little time to &s;eeke a Harbor, was our great de&s;ire to performe the di&s;covery; having the Sea open in all that part, and &s;till likelihood of a pa&s;&s;age: but when we had coa&s;t|ed the land &s;o farre to the S. ward, that hope of a pa&s;&s;age was none, then the yeere was too far &s;pent, and many of our men very weake, and withall we having &s;ome beliefe that Ships the next yeare would be &s;et forth about the killing of whales which might doe better then we.</P>
<P>And &s;eeing I have briefly &s;et downe what hopes there is of making a profitable Voyage, it is not unfit your Wor&s;hip &s;hould know what let or hindrance may be to the &s;ame; the chiefe&s;t cau&s;e is, that &s;ome yeares it may happen by rea&s;on of Ice lying between 72. &frac12;&punc; and 76. &s;o that the Ships cannot come into tho&s;e parts untill the middle of Iuly, &s;o that want of time to &s;tay in the Country may bee &s;ome let, yet they may well tarry untill the la&s;t of Augu&s;t: in which &s;pace much bu&s;ine&s;&s;e may be done, and great &s;tore of oyle made. Neverthele&s;&s;e, if &s;tore of Whales come in, as no feare to the contrary; what cannot be made in Oyle, may bee brought home in Blubber, and the Finnes may ari&s;e to good profit. Another hinderance will be, becau&s;e the bottome of the Sound will not be &s;o &s;oone cleare as would bee wi&s;hed; by meanes whereof, now and then a Whale may be lo&s;t. The &s;ame cau&s;e &s;ometime hapneth in <HI>Greeneland.</HI> Yet I am per&s;waded the Sounds before, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> never will be cleare before the 20. of Iuly. Wee this yeere were in Whales Iland the 4. day among&s;t many Whales, and might have &s;trooke them without let of Ice.</P>
<P>Furthermore, there is little wood to bee expected either for fire, or other nece&s;&s;aries; therefore Coales and other &s;uch things mu&s;t be provided at home, they will bee much more the ready there.</P>
<P>Thus much I thought good to certifie to your Wor&s;hip,
<PB N="153" REF="74">

<P>_GEntlemen, our <HI>Yorke&s;hire</HI> Proverbe is, <HI>Plaine dealing is a Iewell;</HI> So it is, that I was neither importuned nor intreated to this vndertaking by any eyther Noble or Gentle, but the Truth is, that I had beene itching after it e|ver &s;ince 1606. when I &s;hould have gone Mate to <HI>Iohn Knight,</HI> of whom doth follow, yet I mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e that heere my ambition &s;oa|red a pitch higher then my abilitie, as now time hath made me to know, yet his Di&s;cretion and Experience taught him to di&s;cerne of what could bee in my youth, but I pre&s;uming vpon &s;ome parts I had, as the v&s;e of the Globes and other Mathe|maticke In&s;truments, (having beene Sea bred from my Boyes|time, and had beene in the <HI>Mediterranian, Spaine, France, Holland, Norway, Denmarke,</HI> and the <HI>Balticke</HI> Sea,) thought my &s;elfe to bee fit for the be&s;t imployment, de&s;ired to be pluckt before I was ripe; but hee dur&s;t not depend vpon me in that place for the Voyage, &s;o as I did not proceed with him; yet I was &s;till kept in Marine imployments along the Coa&s;t and Cro&s;sing the Sea, whereby I gained Experience, and al&s;o at the Returnes home of all Ships from thence, I enqui|red of the Ma&s;ters Mates and others that were that way im|ployed,
<PB N="170" REF="85">
whereby I gathered by Report and Di&s;cour&s;e and Ma|nu&s;cripts, how farre they had proceeded, what they had done, and what was to doe: To better which, I often repaired to Mr. <HI>IOHN TAPPE,</HI> who&s;e acquaintance was much amongst the&s;e men, he al&s;o acquainting me with Mr. <HI>THO. STERNE</HI> Globe-maker, (whom I have found to have engro&s;&s;ed all tho&s;e former Voyages by Relation, Manu&s;cripts; and Maps;) from whom I gathered much, and mu&s;t needs &s;ay, hee is a very well de&s;erving Practitioner: So that I thought my &s;elfe to be now ready for the &s;ame attempt, when occa&s;ion &s;hould pre&s;ent it &s;elfe.</P>
<P>Which fell out by former acquaintance I had with that fa|mous Mathematician Mr. <HI>HENRY BRIGGES,</HI> who moo|ved me thereto and I willingly con&s;ented, &s;o as things could be brought to pa&s;&s;e, the which to &s;trengthen him&s;elfe, hee acquainted that Hon: Knight Sir <HI>IOHN BROOKE,</HI> whom both to&punc; doe their King &s;ervice, &amp; the Publike good, per&s;wades with divers of their friends to come into the Adventure.</P>
<P>Whereupon, wee exhibited a Petition to his Maie&s;ty for the lend of a Ship for the Voyage and countenance to the Action, who Graciou&s;ly accepted and granted both; but the time of the yeare was &s;o farre &s;pent before wee could make our provi&s;ion ready, as wee were forced to de&s;i&s;t vntill the yeare following: in which proce&s;&s;e Mr. <HI>BRIGGES</HI> decea&s;ed, and the one halfe of the Adventure fell away.</P>
<P>In the meane time and before the next yeare, one Captaine <HI>IAMES</HI> of <HI>Bri&s;tow,</HI> had &s;o wrought with the Marchants of the &s;ayd Citie for to &s;et forth one Ship for the &s;ame de&s;igne, as they were willing to adventure &s;o as they might &s;hare with <HI>London,</HI> in equall honour and profit, whether Ship &s;oever found the &s;ame, and this as was &s;ignified in a Letter from Captaine <HI>IAMES</HI> to Mr. <HI>BRIGGES,</HI> which Letter I did &s;ee is he &s;howed the &s;ame to Sir <HI>IOHN BROOKE,</HI> they both con|&s;enting to write backe againe vnto him that the Reque&s;t was
<PB N="171" REF="85">
conde&s;cended vnto, of which and for better a&s;&s;urance, Capt. <HI>IAMES</HI> ridde from <HI>Bri&s;tow</HI> to <HI>Oxford</HI> before the death of Mr. <HI>BRIGGES</HI> de&s;iring, that &s;eeing we were both to goe forth in one yeare that hee might goe in the higher place, but was denyed.</P>
<P>In this interim came home that Honourable Knight Sir <HI>THOMAS ROE</HI> from his Amba&s;&s;age to the King of <HI>Swe|den,</HI> who being made acquainted with the De&s;igne, gave it his be&s;t furtherance, when his Maie&s;ty &s;ending for this voy|ages never failing friend Sir <HI>IOHN WOLSTENHOLM</HI> the elder Knight, appointing them two to expediate forward the enterprize. Commanding the Ma&s;ter and Wardens of the <HI>Trinity-Hou&s;e</HI> to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting hereunto; and young Sir <HI>Iohn Wol&s;tenholme,</HI> that now is, was appointed Trea&s;urer.</P>
<P>The Ship of his Maie&s;ties, was (of my owne chu&s;ing, and the be&s;t for condition and quality, e&s;pecially for this voyage that the world could afford) of Burthen 80. Tonnes, the num|ber of men 20. and 2. boyes, and by all our Cares was &s;hea|thed, Cordaged, Builded and repaired; all things being made exactly ready again&s;t an appointed time.</P>
<P>My greate&s;t care was to have my men of Godly conver&s;a|tion, and &s;uch, as their yeares of time not exceeding 35. had gained good Experience, that I might thereby be the better a&s;&s;i&s;ted, e&s;pecially by &s;uch as had been vpon tho&s;e Fro&s;t biting voyages by which they were hardned for indurance, and could not &s;o &s;oone be di&s;mayed at the &s;ight of the Ice. For beard|le&s;&s;e younkers, I knew as many as could man the Boate was e|nough; and for all our dependances was vpon GOD alone, for I had neither private end, ambition, or vaine glory.</P>
<P>And all the&s;e things I had contractedly done by the Ma&s;ter, Wardens and A&s;&s;i&s;tants of the <HI>Trinity-Hou&s;e.</HI> For a Lieu|tenant I had no v&s;e, but it grieved me much that I could not get one man that had bin on the &s;ame voyage before, by who&s;e coun&s;aile or di&s;cour&s;e I might better have &s;hunned the Ice.</P>

<P>Yet had I had no more then would have brought home the Ship, if my men had &s;tood, and if by their death, or reliefe of birds or Deere, I had &s;tore remaining, yet I doubt the remay|ning &s;tomacks, would have beene too weake (before the long winter there had left them) to have endured &s;alt meate in the Summer, &s;o as the more victuall the fewer hands for labour, and there would be no &s;paring as I conceived by &s;hort allow|ance.</P>

<P>For when, after my home comming, I told him hee could not be certaine of the Tyde he tooke at <HI>Notingham,</HI> was true; for that his boate was never on land, his an&s;were was (God a mercy for nothing) for I had not above 8 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ound men; &s;o this doth appear as I did co~ceive, before my returne.
