<HEAD>NEW ENGLANDS FIRST FRUITS: 1. In re&s;pect of the INDIANS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_THe Lord, who u&s;eth not to be wanting to the de&s;ires of his Servants, as he hath not fru&s;trated the ends of our Tran&s;planting in &s;undry other re&s;pects; &s;o neither in the giving &s;ome light to tho&s;e poore <HI>Indians,</HI> who have ever &s;ate in helli&s;h darkne&s;&s;e, adoring the <HI>Divell</HI> him&s;elfe for their <HI>GOD:</HI> but hath given us &s;ome te&s;timony of his gracious acceptance of our poore endeavours towards them&punc; and of our groanes to him&s;elfe for mercy upon tho&s;e mi&s;erable Soules (the very Ruines of Mankind) there among&s;t us; our very bowels yer|ning within us to &s;ee them goe downe to Hell by &s;warmes with|out remedy.</P>
<P>Wherefore we judged it our duty no longer to conceale but to de|clare (to the prai&s;e of his owe free grace) what <HI>fir&s;t Fruits</HI> he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">h begun to gather in among&s;t them, as a &s;ure pledge (we are con&s;ident) of a greater <HI>Harve&s;t</HI> in his owne time. And wonder not that wee mention no more in&s;tances at pre&s;ent: but con&s;ider, Fir&s;t their in|finite di&s;tance from Chri&s;tianity, having never been prepared there|unto by any Civility at all. Secondly, the difficulty of their Lan|guage to us, and of ours to them; there being no Rules <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o learne ei|ther by. Thirdly, the diver&s;ity of their owne Language to it &s;elfe;
<PB N="2" REF="3">every part of that Countrey having its own Dialect, differing much from the other; all which make their comming into the Go&s;pel the more &s;low. But what God hath done for &s;ome of them, we will declare.</P>
<P N="1">1. MAny years &s;ince at <HI>Plimmouth</HI> Plantation, when the Church did fa&s;t and pray for Raine in extreame Drought; it being a very hot and cleare &s;un-&s;hine day, all the former part thereof; An <HI>Indian</HI> of good quality, being pre&s;ent, and &s;eeing what they were a|bout, fell a wondring at them for praying for raine in a day &s;o un|likely, when all Sunne and no Clouds appeared; and thought that their God was not able to give Raine at &s;uch a time as that: but this poore wretch &s;eeing them &s;till to continue in their Prayers, and be|holding that at la&s;t the Clouds began to ri&s;e, and by that time they had ended their Duty, the Raine fell in a mo&s;t &s;weet, con&s;tant, &s;oaking &s;howre, fell into wonderment at the power that the Engli&s;h had with their God, and the greatne&s;&s;e and goodne&s;&s;e of that God whom they &s;erved, and was &s;mitten with terror that he had abu&s;ed them and their God by his former hard thoughts of them; and re|&s;olved from that day not to re&s;t till he did know this great good <HI>God,</HI> and for that end to for&s;ake the <HI>Indians,</HI> and cleare to the Engli&s;h, which he pre&s;ently did, and laboured by all publique and private meanes to &s;uck in more and more of the knowledge of God, and his wayes. And as he increa&s;ed in knowledge &s;o in affection and al&s;o in his practice, reforming and conforming him&s;elfe accordingly: and (though he was much tempted by inticements, &s;coffes and &s;cornes from the <HI>Indians</HI>) yet, could he never be gotten from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> nor from &s;eeking after their God, but died among&s;t them, leaving &s;ome good hopes in their hearts, that his &s;oule went to re&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Sagamore Iohn,</HI> Prince of <HI>Ma&s;&s;aque&s;ets,</HI> was from our very fir&s;t landing more courteous, ingenious, and to the Engli&s;h more loving then others of them; he de&s;ired to learne and &s;peake our Language, and loved to imitate us in our behaviour and apparrell, and began to hearken after our God and his wayes, and would much commend Engli&s;h-men, and their God; &s;aying (<HI>Much good men, much good God</HI>) and being convinced that our condition and wayes were better farre then theirs, did re&s;olve and promi&s;e to leave the <HI>Indians,</HI> and come live with us; but yet kept downe by feare of the &s;coffes of the <HI>Indi|ans,</HI> had not power to make good his purpo&s;e; yet went on not with|out
<PB N="3" REF="3">&s;ome trouble of mind, and &s;ecret plucks of Con&s;cience, as the &s;equel declares: for being &s;truck with death, fearfully cryed out of him&s;elfe that he had not come to live with us, to have knowne our <HI>God better:</HI> <Q>But now (<HI>&s;aid he</HI>) I mu&s;t die, the God of the Engli&s;h is much angry with me, and will de&s;troy me; ah, <HI>I</HI> was affraid of the &s;coffes of the&s;e wicked <HI>Indians;</HI> yet my Child &s;hall live with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and learne to knew their God when I am dead; Ile give him to Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> he is a much Good man, and much loved me:</Q> &s;o &s;ent for Mr. <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> to come to him, and committed his onely Child to his care, and &s;o died.</P>
<P N="3">3. Divers of the <HI>Indians</HI> Children, Boyes and Girles we have re|ceived into our hou&s;es, who are long &s;ince civilized, and in &s;ubjecti|on to us, painfull and handy in their bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and can &s;peak our lan|guage familiarly; divers of whom can read Engli&s;h, and begin to un|der&s;tand in their mea&s;ure, the grounds of Chri&s;tian Religion; &s;ome of them are able to give us account of the Sermons they heare, and of the word read and expounded in our Families, and are convinced of their &s;infull and mi&s;erable E&s;tates, and affected with the &s;en&s;e of Gods di&s;plea&s;ure, and the thoughts of Eternity, and will &s;ometimes tremble and melt into teares at our opening and pre&s;&s;ing the Word upon their Con&s;ciences; and as farre as we can di&s;cerne, &s;ome of them u&s;e to pray in &s;ecret and are much in love with us, and cannot indure to returne any more to the <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>Some of them will not be ab&s;ent from a Sermon or Family du|ties if they can help it; and we have knowne &s;ome would u&s;e to weep and cry when detained by occa&s;ion from the Sermon.</P>
<P>Others of them are very inqui&s;itive after God and his wayes; and being them&s;elves indu&s;trious in their Calling, will much complaine of other &s;ervants idlene&s;&s;e, and reprove them.</P>
<P>One of them, who for &s;ome mi&s;demeanour that laid him open to publique puni&s;hment, ran away; and being gone, God &s;o followed him, that of his owne accord he returned home, rendred him&s;elfe to Ju&s;tice and was willing to &s;ubmit him&s;elfe, though he might have e&s;caped.</P>
<P>An <HI>Indian</HI> Maid at <HI>Salem,</HI> would often come from the Word, cry|ing out with abundance of teares, concluding that &s;he mu&s;t burne when &s;he die, and would &s;ay, &s;he knew her &s;elfe naught for pre&s;ent, and like to be mi&s;erable for ever, unle&s;&s;e free Grace &s;hould prevent it; and after this grew very carefull of her carriage, proved indu&s;tri|ous in her place, and &s;o continued.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P>Another often frequenting the Hou&s;e of one of the Mini&s;ters at <HI>Salem,</HI> would tell him the Story of the Bible, even to his admirati|on, and that he attended upon the Word preached, and loved it; and how he could tell all the Commandements, and in particular each Commandement by it &s;elfe, and how he laboured to keep them all; and yet for all this (&s;aid he) <HI>[Me are, and walke in fire]</HI> that is, when I die, I mu&s;t to Hell: That Mini&s;ter asked him why? he an&s;wered, becau&s;e I know not <HI>Ie&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and pray'd him earne&s;tly to teach him <HI>Ie&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and after went out among&s;t the <HI>Indians,</HI> and called upon them to put away all their wives &s;ave one, becau&s;e it was a &s;inne again&s;t Engli&s;h-mans Saviour.</P>
<P>Another <HI>Indian</HI> comming by, and &s;eeing one of the Engli&s;h (who was remote from our juri&s;diction, prophaning the Lords day, by fel|ling of a tree, &s;aid to him, <HI>Doe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ou not know that this is the Lords day,</HI> in <HI>Ma&s;&s;aqu&s;etts? much machet man,</HI> that is <HI>very wicked man, what, breake you Gods Day?</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame man comming into an hou&s;e in tho&s;e parts where a man and his wife were chiding, and they bidding him &s;it downe, he was welcome; he an&s;wered, <HI>He would not &s;tay there, God did not dwell there, Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">mock,</HI> (that is <HI>the Devill</HI>) <HI>was there,</HI> and &s;o departed.</P>
<P>One of the <HI>Sagamores,</HI> having complaint made to him by &s;ome of the Engli&s;h, that his men did u&s;e to kill Pigeons upon the Lords day, thereupon forbad them to doe &s;o any more; yet afterwards &s;ome of them did attempt it, and climbing the high trees (upon which Pige|ons in that Countrey u&s;e to make their ne&s;ts) one of them fell down from off the tree and brake his neck, and another fell down and brake &s;ome of his limbs: thereupon the <HI>Sagamore</HI> &s;ent two grave old men to proclaime it among&s;t his <HI>Indians,</HI> that none of them &s;hould kill Pigeons upon the Sabboth day any more.</P>
<P>Another <HI>Indian</HI> hearing of the fame of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and their God came from a far to &s;ee them, and &s;uch was this mans love to the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> and their wayes after he came acquainted with them, that he la|boured to transform him&s;elfe into the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> manners and practi&s;es, as if he had been an Engli&s;h man indeed; he would be called no more by his <HI>Indian</HI> name, but would be named <HI>William;</HI> he would not goe naked like the <HI>Indians,</HI> but cloathed ju&s;t as one of our &s;elves; he ab|horred to dwell with the <HI>Indians</HI> any longer; but for&s;aking all his friends and Kindred dwelt wholly with us; when he &s;ate downe to meat with us, if thanks were given before he came in, or if he did eat
<PB N="5" REF="4">by him&s;elfe, con&s;tantly he would give thanks reverently and grave|ly, he frequented the word and family duties where he came, and gat a good mea&s;ure of knowledge beyond ordinary, being a man of &s;in|gular par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and would complaine that he knew not Chri&s;t, and with|out him, he &s;aid all he did was nothing; hee was &s;o zealous for the Lords day, that (as it was ob&s;erved) if he &s;aw any profaning it, he would rebuke them and threaten them to carry them to the Gover|nour.</P>
<P>All which things weighed, we dare not but hope, that many of them, doe belong to the Kingdome of God; and what further time may produce, we leave it to him that is excellent in Coun&s;ell, and wonderfull in working.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is al&s;o a Blackmore maid, that hath long lived at <HI>Dorche|&s;ter</HI> in <HI>New England,</HI> unto whom God hath &s;o ble&s;&s;ed the publique and private means of Grace that &s;he is not only indued with a com|petent mea&s;ure of knowledge in the my&s;teries of God, and convicti|on of her mi&s;erable e&s;tate by &s;inne; but hath al&s;o experience of a &s;aving work of grace in her heart, and a &s;weet &s;avour of Chri&s;t brea|thing in her; in&s;omuch that her &s;oule hath longed to enjoy Church-fellow&s;hip with the Saints there, and having propounded her de&s;ire to the Elders of the Church, after &s;ome triall of her taken in private, &s;he was called before the whole Church, and there did make confe&s;|&s;ion of her knowledge in the My&s;teries of Chri&s;t and of the work of Conver&s;ion upon her Soule: And after that there was &s;uch a te&s;ti|mony given of her blamele&s;&s;e and godly Conver&s;ation, that &s;he was admitted a member by the joynt con&s;ent of the Church with great joy to all their hearts. Since which time, we have heard her much admiring Gods free grace to &s;uch a poore wretch as &s;he was; that God leaving all her friends and Kindred &s;till in their &s;innes, &s;hould ca&s;t an eye upon her, to make her a member of Chri&s;t, and of the Church al&s;o: and hath with teares exhorted &s;ome other of the <HI>In|dians</HI> that live with us to embrace <HI>Ie&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> declaring how willing he would be to receive them even as he had received her.</P>
<P N="5">5. The la&s;t in&s;tance we will give &s;hall be of that famous Indian <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ua&s;h</HI> who was a Captaine a proper man of per&s;on, and of a very grave and &s;ober &s;pirit; the Story of which comming to our hands very lately, was indeed the occa&s;ion of writing all the re&s;t: This man a few yeares &s;ince, &s;eeing and beholding the mighty power of God in our Engli&s;h Forces, how they fell upon the <HI>Pequits,</HI> where
<PB N="6" REF="5">divers hundreds of them were &s;laine in an houre: The Lord, as a God of glory in great terrour did appeare unto the Soule and Con|&s;cience of this poore Wretch in that very act; and though before that time he had low apprehen&s;ions of our God, having conceived him &s;o be (as he &s;aid) but a <HI>Muskett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> God or a God like unto a flye; and as meane thoughts of the Engli&s;h that &s;erved this God that they were &s;illy weake men; yet from that time he was convinced and per|&s;waded that our God was a mo&s;t dreadfull God; and that one <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> man by the help of his God was able to &s;lay and put to flight an hundred <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI></P>
<P>This conviction did pur&s;ue and follow him night and day, &s;o that he could have no re&s;t or quiet becau&s;e hee was ignorant of the <HI>En|gli&s;h mans God:</HI> he went up and down bemoaning his condition, and filling every place where he came with &s;ighes and groanes.</P>
<P>Afterward it plea&s;ed the Lord that &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> (well acquainted with his Language) did meet with him; thereupon as a Hart pan|ting after the water Brookes he enquired after God with &s;uch ince&s;|&s;ant diligence that they were con&s;trained con&s;tantly for his &s;atisfa|ction to &s;pend more then halfe the night in conver&s;ing with him.</P>
<P>Afterwards he came to dwell among&s;t the Engli&s;h at <HI>Connecticus,</HI> &s;till travelling with all his might and lamenting after the Lord: his manner was to &s;mite his hand on his brea&s;t, and to complaine &s;adly of his heart &s;aying it was <HI>much machet,</HI> (that is very evill) and when any &s;pake with him he would &s;ay <HI>Wequa&s;h, no God, Wequa&s;h no know Chri&s;t.</HI> It plea&s;ed the Lord, that in the u&s;e of the meanes, he grew greatly in the knowledge of Chri&s;t, and in the Principles of Religi|on and became thorowly reformed according to his light, hating and loathing him&s;elfe for his deare&s;t &s;innes, which were e&s;pecially the&s;e two <HI>Lu&s;t</HI> and <HI>Revenge,</HI> this repentance for the former was te|&s;tified by his temperance and ab&s;tinence from all occa&s;ions, or mat|ter of provocation thereunto. Secondly, by putting away all his Wives, &s;aving the fir&s;t, to whom he had mo&s;t right.</P>
<P>His repentance for the latter was te&s;tified by an eminent degree of meekne&s;&s;e and patience, that now, if any did abu&s;e him, he could lie downe at their feet, and if any did &s;mite him on the one cheeke, he would rather turne the other, than offend them: many trialls hee had from the <HI>Jndians</HI> in this ca&s;e. Thirdly, by going up and downe to tho&s;e hee had offered violence or wrong unto, confe&s;&s;ing it, and making re&s;titution.</P>
<PB N="15" REF="5">
<P>Afterwards he went among&s;t the Indians, like that poore Woman of <HI>Samaria,</HI> proclaiming <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and telling them what a Trea&s;ure he had found, in&s;tructing them in the knowledge of the true <HI>God</HI> and this he did with a grave and &s;erious &s;pirit, warning them with all faithfullne&s;&s;e to flee from the wrath to come, by breaking off their &s;innes and wickedne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>This cour&s;e of his did &s;o di&s;turb the Devill, that ere long &s;ome of the Indians, who&s;e hearts Satan had filled did &s;ecretly give him poy|&s;on, which he tooke without &s;u&s;pition: and when he lay upon his death bed, &s;ome Indians who were by him, wi&s;hed him according to the Indian manner, to &s;end for <HI>Po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ow</HI> (that is to &s;ay) a Wizzard; he told them, <HI>If Ie&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ay that Wequa&s;h &s;hall live, then Wequa&s;h mu&s;t live; if Ie&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ay that Wequa&s;h &s;hall dye, then Wequa&s;h is willing to dye, and will not lengthen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ur his life by any &s;uch meanes.</HI> Before he dyed, he did bequeath his Child to the godly care of the Engli&s;h for education and in&s;truction and &s;o yielded up his &s;oule into <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> his hands.</P>
<P>I cannot omit the te&s;timony of Mr. <HI>Sh</HI> a godly Mini&s;ter in the <HI>Bay,</HI> that wrote to his Friend in <HI>London</HI> concerning this Story, his lines are full plain and pithy his words the&s;e,</P>
<P><HI>Wequa&s;h the famous Indian at the Rivers mouth is dead, and certainly in heaven; gloriou&s;ly did the Grace of</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>&s;hine forth in his conver&s;ation, a yeare and a halfe before his death he knew Chri&s;t, he loved Chri&s;t, he prea|ched Chri&s;t up and down, and then &s;uffered Martyrdome for Chri&s;t; and when he dyed&punc; he gave his &s;oule to Chri&s;t, and his only child to the Engli&s;h, rejoycing in this hope, that the child &s;hould know more of Chri&s;t then its poore Father ever did.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we have given you a little ta&s;t of the &s;princklings of Gods &s;pirit, upon a few Indians, but one may ea&s;ily imagine, that here are not all that may be produced: for if a very few of us here pre&s;ent, upon very &s;udden thoughts, have &s;natcht up only &s;uch in&s;tances which came at pre&s;ent to hand, you may conveive, that if all in our Plantations (which are farre and wide) &s;hould &s;et them&s;elves to bring in the confluence of all their Ob&s;ervations together, much more might be added.</P>
<P>We beleeve one mean among&s;t others, that hath thus farre wonne the&s;e poore wretches to looke after the Go&s;pell, hath been the deal|ings and carriages, which God hath guided the Engli&s;h in our Pa|tent, to exerci&s;e towards them: For,</P>
<PB N="8" REF="6">
<P N="1">1. At our entrance upon the Land, it was not with violence and intru&s;ion, but free and faire, with their con&s;ents and allowance the chief Sagamores of all that part of the Countrey, entertaining us heartily, and profe&s;&s;ed we were all much welcome.</P>
<P N="2">2. When any of them had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, or right unto any Land we were to plant upon, none were &s;uffered, (to our knowledge) to take one acre from them, but do u&s;e to compound with them to con|tent.</P>
<P N="3">3. They have had ju&s;tice truly exerci&s;ed towards them in all other particular acts; that as we expect right dealing from them, in ca&s;e any of them &s;hall tre&s;pa&s;&s;e us, we &s;end to their Sagamore, and he pre&s;ently rights us, or el&s;e we &s;ummon them to our Court to an&s;wer it; &s;o if any of our men offend them, and complaint and proofe be made to any of our Magi&s;trates, or the publique Court (they know) they are &s;ure to be righted to the utmo&s;t by us.</P>
<P N="4">4. The humanity of the Enghi&s;h towards them doth much gaine upon them, we being generally wary, and tender in giving them of|fen&s;ive or har&s;h language, or carriage, but u&s;e them fairly and cour|teou&s;ly, with loving termes, good looks and kind &s;alutes.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> 1. Linnen Fu&s;tians Dimettees we are making already. Secondly, Sheepe are comming on for woollen cloath.

<P N="5">5. <HI>Obj.</HI> Your Winters are cold.</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> True, at &s;ometimes when the wind blowes &s;trong at <HI>Nor-We&s;t:</HI> but it holds not long together, and then it u&s;eth to be ve|ry moderate for a good &s;pace. Fir&s;t the coldne&s;&s;e being not naturall (that place being 42. degrees) but accidentall. Secondly, The cold there is no impediment to health, but very whol&s;ome for our bo|dies, in&s;omuch that all &s;orts generally, weake and &s;trong had &s;carce ever &s;uch mea&s;ure of health in all their lives as there. Thirdly, Its not a moi&s;t and foggie cold, as in <HI>Holland,</HI> and &s;ome parts of <HI>England,</HI> but bright, cleare, and faire wether, that men are &s;eldome troubled in Winter with coughes and Rheumes. Fourthly, it hinders not our imployment, for people are able to worke or travell u&s;ually all the Winter long, &s;o there is no lo&s;&s;e of time, &s;imply in re&s;pect of the cold. Fiftly good fires (wood being &s;o plentifull) will make amends.</P>

<P>Secondly their E&s;tates now he in hou&s;es, Lands, Hor&s;es, Cattel, Corne &amp;c. though they have not &s;o much money as they had here, and &s;o cannot make appearance of their wealth to tho&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> yet they have it &s;till, &s;o that their E&s;tates are not lo&s;t but changed.</P>
<P N="3">3.

<P N="4">4. Some may be poore (&s;o we are &s;ure) many are rich, that carri|ed nothing at all that now have Hou&s;e Land, Corne, Cattel, &amp;c and &s;uch as carry &s;omething are much encrea&s;ed.</P>

Thirdly, Let &s;uch if any &s;uch there be as have ought to alleadge, deale fairely and above board, and
<PB N="26" REF="15">come and ju&s;tifie any thing again&s;t the Country to our faces while we are here to an&s;wer, but &s;uch never yet appeared in any of our pre&s;ence to avouch any thing in this kinde, nor (we beleive) dare do it without blu&s;hing.</P>

Secondly, few that we know of intend to abide here, but doe come on &s;ome &s;peciall bu&s;ines, and purpo&s;e to returne. Thirdly of them that are come hither to &s;tay, (on our knowledge) &s;ome of the wi&s;e&s;t repent them already, and wi&s;h them&s;elves there againe. Fourthly, as &s;ome went thither upon &s;udden undige&s;ted grounds, and &s;aw not God leading them in their way, but were carryed by an un&s;tayed &s;pirit, &s;o have they returned upon as &s;leight headle&s;&s;e, unworthy rea|&s;ons as they went Fiftly others mu&s;t have elbow-roome, and can|not abide to be &s;o pinioned with the &s;trict Government in the <HI>Com|mon-wealth,</HI> or Di&s;cipline in the Church, now why &s;hould &s;uch live there; as <HI>Ireland</HI> will not brooke venemous bea&s;ts, &s;o will not that Land vile per&s;ons, and loo&s;e livers.
