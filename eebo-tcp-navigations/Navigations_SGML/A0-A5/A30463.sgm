<P>I need tell you nothing of the irregular, and yet magni|ficent situation of <HI>Lions</HI>; of the noble <HI>Rivers</HI> that meet there; of the <HI>Rock</HI> Cut from so vast a height for a prison, of the <HI>Carthusians</HI> Gardens, of the <HI>Town-house,</HI> of the <HI>Iesuites</HI> Colledge, and <HI>Library</HI> of the famous <HI>Nunnery of S.

<P>The <HI>speech of Claudius</HI> ingraven on a <HI>Plate of Brass,</HI> and set in the end of the low walk in the <HI>Town-hsuse,</HI> is one of the noblest <HI>Antiquities</HI> in the World, by which we see the way of writing and pointing in that age very copiou|sly. The <HI>shield of silver</HI> of 22 pound weight, in which some remains of gilding do yet appear, and that seems to represent that generous action of <HI>Scipio's,</HI> of restoring a fair captive to a <HI>Celtiberian Prince,</HI> is certainly the no|blest piece of <HI>Plate</HI> that is now extant; the embossing of it is so fine, and so entire, that it is indeed i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">valuable: and if there were an inscription upon it to put us beyond conjecture, it were yet much more inestimable.</P>
<P>A great many <HI>Inscriptions</HI> are to be seen of the late and Barbarous ages, as <HI>Bonum Memorium,</HI> and <HI>Epitaphium hunc</HI>: there are 23. <HI>Inscriptions</HI> in the <HI>Garden</HI> of the <HI>Fathers of mercy,</HI> but so placed, as it shews how little those who possess them do either understand or value them.

<P>It seems the <HI>impiety</HI> was publick, otherwise a <HI>Husband</HI> would not have recorded it in such a manner; and it is plain that he thought it rose from an excess of <HI>piety.</HI></P>
<P>I need not examin the conjectures of others: but will chuse rather to give you my own, and submit it to your censure.</P>
<P>It seems to me, that this <HI>Sutia Anthis</HI> was a <HI>Christian</HI>&punc; for the Christians, because they would not worship the <HI>Gods</HI> of the <HI>Heathens,</HI> nor participate with them in their sacred rites, were accused both of <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heism</HI> and <HI>Impiety.</HI> This is so often objected, and the <HI>Fathers</HI> in their <HI>Apologies</HI> have answered it so often, that it were lost labour to prove it: so this Wife of <HI>Cecalius Calistio</HI> ha|ving turned <HI>Christian,</HI> it seems he thought he was bound to take some notice of it in the inscription: But by it the gives a honourable character of the <HI>Christian Doctrine</HI> at the fame time that he seems to accuse it; that through an excess of piety, his <HI>Wife</HI> was carried to it: since a mind seriously possessed with a true sense of piety, could no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> avoid the falling under a distaste of <HI>Paganism,</HI> and the be|coming <HI>Christian.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Grenoble</HI> there is not much to be seen, the learned <HI>Mr. Chorier</HI> has some <HI>Manuscripts</HI> of considerable anti|quity.

<P>I will not describe the <HI>Valley of Dauphine,</HI> all to <HI>Cham|bery,</HI> nor entertain you with a Landskip of the Coun|trey, which deserves a better pencil than mine, and in which the heighth and rudeness of the <HI>Mountains,</HI> that al|most shut upon it, together with the beauty, the even|ness and fruitfulness of the <HI>Valley,</HI> that is all along well wa|tered with the River of <HI>Liserre,</HI> make such an agreeable mixture, that this vast diversity of objects, that do at once fill the Eye, gives it a very entertaining prospect.</P>
<P><HI>Chambery</HI> has nothing in it that deserves a long descrip|tion; and <HI>Geneva</HI> is too well known to be much insisted on.

The <HI>Chamber of the Corn</HI> has always <HI>two years</HI> provision for the <HI>City</HI> in store, and forces none but the <HI>Bakers</HI> to buy of it at a taxed price; and so it is both necessary for any extremi|ties, under which the <HI>State</HI> may fall, and is likewise of great advantage; for it gives a good yearly income, that has helpt the <HI>State</HI> to pay near a <HI>Million</HI> of debt, contracted during the <HI>Wars</HI>; and the <HI>Citizens</HI> are not oppressed by it, for every <HI>Inhabitant</HI> may buy his own <HI>Corn</HI> as he pleases, only publick Houses must buy from the <HI>Chamber.</HI> And if one will compare the <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Geneva</HI> togethe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> by this particular, he will be forced to prefer the latter; for if <HI>good Works</HI> are a strong presumption, if not a sure in|dication of a good Faith, then <HI>Iustice,</HI> being a good Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the first form, <HI>Geneva</HI> will certainly carry it.</P>

And a <HI>Minister</HI> that is suteable to his character, is thought so good a match, that generally they have such Estates either by succession, or marriage, as support them suteably to the rank they hold. And in <HI>Geneva</HI> there is so great a regulation upon expences of all sorts, that a small sum goes a great way.

<P>There is an universal <HI>Civility,</HI> not only towards <HI>Stran|gers,</HI> but towards one another, that reigns all the <HI>Town</HI> over, and leans to an excess: so that in them one sees a mixture of a <HI>French</HI> openness, and an <HI>Italian</HI> exactness: there is indeed a little too much of the last.</P>
<P>The publick <HI>Iusti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> of the <HI>City</HI> is quick and good, and is more commended than the private <HI>Iustice</HI> of those that deal in trade: a want of sincerity is much lamented by those that know the <HI>Town</HI> well.

One of the best parts of their <HI>La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> is the way of selling <HI>Estates,</HI> which is likewise practised in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and is called <HI>Subhastation,</HI> from the <HI>Ro|man</HI> custum of selling <HI>Sub hasta.</HI> A man that is to buy an <HI>Estate,</HI> agrees with the owner, and then intimates it to the <HI>Gover<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ment</HI>; who order three several proclama|tions to be made six Weeks one after another of the inten|ded

<P>This Custom prevails likewise in <HI>Swisse,</HI> where also <HI>twelve years</HI> possession gives a prescription; so that in no place of the World are the <HI>titles to Estates</HI> so secure as here.

The 200. are chosen and censured by the 25. so that these two <HI>Councils,</HI> which are both for life, are checks one upon another.

<P>In the mean while, the <HI>Fren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h Money</HI> went about very liberally at <HI>Bern,</HI> and after those that were most likely to make opposition were gained, the <HI>French Minister</HI> proposed to them the necessity in which his Master found himself engaged to secure himself on that side; but that still he would grant a neutrality on their account, if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would agree to it; and with this all the Assurances that could be given in Words were offered to them, that they should ne|ver find the least Prejudice from the Neighbou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hood of the <HI>French,</HI> but on the contrary, all possible Protection.

so that it seemed almost inevitable to give way to the <HI>French</HI> Proposition; but one proposed that which an unbyassed Assembly would certainly have accepted, that they should go themselves and take the Country; and by so doing, they would secure the Neutrality, which was all that the <HI>French</HI> pretended to desire; and they might easily satisfy the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and reimburse themselves of the Expence of the Invasion, by restoring the <HI>Country</HI> to them, when a General Peace should be made.

They told me, that all the ground down to the bottom of the Hill was dug in|to vaults; this plat-form is the chief walk of the Town, chiefly about Sun set; and the <HI>River</HI> underneath presents a very beautiful prospect&punc; For there is a Cut taken off from it for the Mills, but all along as this Cut goes, the Water of <HI>Aar</HI> runs over a sloping bank of Stone, which they say, was made at a vast charge, and makes a noble and large <HI>Cascade.</HI></P>
<P>The second Church is the <HI>Dominicans Chappel,</HI> where I saw the famous hole that went to an <HI>Image</HI> in the Church, from one of the <HI>Cells</HI> of the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> which leads me to set down that Story at some length: For as it was one of the most signal cheats, that the World has
<PB N="22" REF="25">
known; so it falling out about <HI>twenty years</HI> before the <HI>Reformation</HI> was received in <HI>Bern,</HI> it is very probable that it contributed not a little to the preparing of the spi|rits of the people to that change. I am she more able to give a particular account of it, because I read the <HI>origin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> process</HI> in the <HI>Latin record,</HI> signed by the <HI>Notaries</HI> of the Court of the <HI>delegates</HI> that the <HI>Pope</HI> sent to try the matter. The record is above 130 sheets, writ close, and of all side<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, it being indeed a large volum; and I found the printed ac|counts so defective, that I was at the pains of reading the whole process, of which I will give here a true abstract.</P>
<P>The two famous <HI>Orders,</HI> that had possessed themselves of the esteem of those datk <HI>ages,</HI> were engaged in a mighty ri|valry. The <HI>Dominicans</HI> were the more learned, they were the eminentest Preachers of those times, and had the con|duct of the <HI>Courts of Inquisition,</HI> and the other chief officer in the <HI>Church</HI> in their hands. But on the other hand, the <HI>Franciscans</HI> had an outward appearance of more severity a ruder habit, stricter rules, and greater poverty: all whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> gave them such advantages in the eyes of the simple multi|tude, as were able to ballance the other honours of the <HI>Do|minican Order.</HI> In short, the two <HI>Orders</HI> were engaged in a high rivalry, but the devotion towards the <HI>Virgin</HI> being the prevailing passion of those times, the <HI>Franciscans</HI> upon thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had great advantages. The <HI>Dominicans,</HI> thar are all engage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the defence of <HI>Thomas Aquinas's</HI> opinions, were there|by obliged to assert, that she was born in <HI>Original Sin</HI>; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> was proposed to the people by the <HI>Franciscans</HI> as no less than <HI>Blasphemy,</HI> and by this the <HI>Dominicans</HI> began to lose ground extreamly in the minds of the people, who were strongly prepossed in favour of the <HI>immaculate Conceptio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>&punc;</P>
<P>About the beginning of the 15th <HI>Century,</HI> a <HI>Francisc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> happened to preach in <HI>Francfort,</HI> and one <HI>Wigand a Domi|nican</HI> coming into the Church, the <HI>Cordelier</HI> seeing him, broke out into exclamations, praising God that he was no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of an <HI>Order</HI> that prophaned the <HI>Virgin,</HI> or that poysone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Princes</HI> in the Sacrament, (for a <HI>Dominican</HI> had poysone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Emperor <HI>Henry</HI> the VII. with the <HI>Sacrament,) Wiga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> being extreamly provoked with this bloody reproach, gav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

him the Lye, upon which a dispute arose, which ended in a tumult, that had almost cost the <HI>Dominican</HI> his life, yet he got away. The whole <HI>Order</HI> resolved to take their revenge, and in a <HI>Chapter,</HI> held at <HI>Vimpsen</HI> in the year 1504. they contrived a method for supporting the credit of their Or|der, which was much sunk in the opinion of the people, and for bearing down the reputation of the <HI>Franciscans,</HI> four of the juncto undertook to manage the design; for they said, since the people were so much disposed to believe Dreams and Fables, they must dream of their side, and en|deavour to cheat the people as well as the others had done. They resolved to make <HI>Bern</HI> the Seene in which the project should be put in execution; for they found the people of <HI>Bern,</HI> at that time apt to Swallow any thing, and not dispo|sed to make severe Enquiries into extraordinary Matters. When they had formed their design, a fit Tool presented it self; for one <HI>Ietzer</HI> came to take their habit as a <HI>Lay-bro|ther,</HI> who had all the dispositions that were necessary for the execution of their project: For he was extream simple, and was much inclined to Austerities, so having observed his temper well, they began to execute their project, the very Night after he took the <HI>Habit,</HI> which was, on <HI>Lady-day</HI> 1507. one of the <HI>Fryers</HI> conveyed himself secretly into his Cell, and appeared to him as if he had been in <HI>Purgatory,</HI> in a strange figure, and he had a Box near his mouth, upon which as he blew, fire seemed to come out of his mouth. He had also some Dogs about him, that appeared as his Tor|mentors, in this posture he came near the <HI>Fryer,</HI> while he was a Bed, and took up a celebrated Story that they used to tell all their <HI>Fryers,</HI> to beget in them a great dread at the laying aside their habit, which was, that one of the <HI>Order,</HI> who was Superiour of their House at <HI>Soloturn,</HI> had gone to <HI>Paris,</HI> but laying aside his habit, was killed in his Lay-habit. The Fryer in the Vizar said, he was that person, and was condemned to <HI>Purgatory</HI> for that Crime; but he added, that he might be rescued out of it by his means, and he seconded this with most horrible Cries, expressing the Miseries which he suffered. The poor Fryer (<HI>Ietzer</HI>) was excessively frigh|ted, but the other advanced, and required a Promise of him
<PB N="24" REF="26">
that which he should desire of him, in order to the deli|vering him out of his Torment. The frighted <HI>Fryer</HI> pro|mised all that he asked of him; then the other said, he knew he was a great Saint, and that his prayers and mor|tifications would prevail, but they must be very extraor|dinary; The whole <HI>Monastery</HI> must for a week together discipline themselves with a Whip, and he must lie pro|strate in the form of one on a <HI>Cross,</HI> in one of their <HI>Chap|pels,</HI> while Mass was said in the sight of all that should come together to it; and he added, that if he did this, he should find the effects of the love that the B. <HI>Virgin</HI> did bear him, together with many other extraordinary things; and said, he would appear again accompanied with two other Spirits; and assured him, that all that he did suffer for his deliverance, should be most gloriously rewarded. Morning was no sooner come than the <HI>Frie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> gave an account of this Apparition to the rest of the <HI>Con|vent,</HI> who seemed extreamly surprised at it; they all pres|sed him to undergo the discipline that was enjoyned him, and every one undertook to bear his share; so the deluded <HI>Fryer</HI> performed it all exactly in one of the <HI>Chappels</HI> of their <HI>Church</HI>: This drew a vast number of Spectators to|gether, who all considered the poor <HI>Fryer</HI> as a Saint, and in the mean while the four <HI>Fryers</HI> that managed the impo|sture, magnified the Miracle of the Apparition to the skie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in their Sermons. The <HI>Fryer's</HI> Confessor was upon the Secret, and by this means they knew all the little passages of the poor <HI>Fryers</HI> life, even to his thoughts, which help|ed them not a little in the Conduct of the matter. The <HI>Confessor</HI> gave him an <HI>Hostie,</HI> with a piece of Wood, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was, as he pretended, a true piece of the <HI>Cross,</HI> and by these he was to fortify himself, if any other Apparition should come to him, since evil Spirits would be certainly chained up by them. The Night after that, the former Ap|parition<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> was renewed, and the masqued <HI>Fryer</HI> brough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> two others with him in such Vizzards, that the <HI>Fry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> thought they were Devils indeed. The <HI>Fryer</HI> presented the <HI>Hostie</HI> to them, which gave them such a cheek, that he
<PB N="25" REF="26">
was fully satisfied of the vertue of this preservative.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fryer,</HI> that pretended he was suffering in <HI>Purga|tory,</HI> said so many things to him relating to the Secre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of his life, and Thoughts, which he had from the <HI>Confes|sor,</HI> that the poor <HI>Fryer</HI> was fully possessed with the opi|nion of the reallity of the Apparition. In two of these Apparitions, that were both managed in the same man|ner, the <HI>Fryer</HI> in the Masque talked much of the <HI>Domini|can Order,</HI> which he said was excessively dear to the B. <HI>Virgin,</HI> who knew her self to be conceived in Original sin, and that tbe <HI>Doctors</HI> who taught the contrary were in Purgatory: That the Story of S. <HI>Bernards</HI> appearing with a spot on him, for having opposed himself to the feast of the Conception, was a Forgery: but that it was true, that some hideous Flies had appeared on St <HI>Bona|ventures</HI> Tomb, who taught the contrary. That the <HI>B. Vir|gin</HI> abhorred the <HI>Cordeliers</HI> for making her equal to her Son; that <HI>Scotus</HI> was damned, whose Canonization the <HI>Cordeliers</HI> were then soliciting hard at <HI>Rome</HI>; and that the Town of <HI>Bern</HI> would be destroyed for harbouring such plagues within their walls. When the injoined discipline was fully performed, the <HI>Spirit</HI> appeared again, and said, he was now delivered out of <HI>Purgatory,</HI> but before he could be admitted to Heaven, he must receive the Sa|crament, having died without it, and after that he would say Mass for those, who had by their great charities <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">escued him out of his pains. The <HI>Fry<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r</HI> fancied the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oice resem|bled the <HI>Priors</HI> a little, but he was th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n so far from sus|pecting any thing, that he gave no great heed to this su|spition. Some dayes after this, tbe same <HI>Fryer</HI> appeared as a <HI>Nun</HI> all in Glory, and told the poor Frier, that she was St. <HI>Barbary,</HI> for whom he had a particular devo|tion; and added, that the <HI>B. Virgin</HI> was so much plea|sed with his charity, that she intended to come and visit him: He immediately called the <HI>Convent</HI> together, and gave the rest of the <HI>Fryers</HI> an account of this Apparition, which was entertained by them all with great joy; and the <HI>Fryer</HI> languished in desires of the accomplishment
<PB N="26" REF="27">
of the promise, that St. <HI>Barbara</HI> had made him. After some dayes, the longed for delusion appeared to him, clothed as the <HI>Virgin</HI> used to be on the great Feasts, and indeed in the same Habits: there were about her some <HI>Angels,</HI> which he afterwards found were the little Statues of Angels, which they set on the Altars on the great Holy Dayes. There was also a pulley fastned in the room over his head, and a cord tied to the Angels, that made them rise up in the Air, and flie about the <HI>Virgin,</HI> which increa|sed the delusion. The <HI>Virgin,</HI> after some endearments to himself, extolling the merit of his charity and di|scipline, told him, that she was conceived in Ori|ginal Sin, and that <HI>Pope Iulius the Second,</HI> that then reigned, was to put an end to the Dispute, and was to abolish the Feast of her Conception, which <HI>Six<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us the fourth</HI> had instituted, and that the <HI>Fryer</HI> was to be the Instrument of perswading the <HI>Pope</HI> of the truth in that matter: She gave him <HI>three drops</HI> of her Sons blood, which were <HI>three tears</HI> of blood that he had shed over <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and this signified that she was <HI>three hours</HI> in Original Sin, after which she was, by his Mercy, delivered out of that State: For it seems the <HI>Dominicans</HI> were resolved so to compound the matter, that they should gain the main point of her Conception in Sin; yet they would comply so far with the reve|rence for the <HI>Virgin,</HI> with which the World was possessed, that she should be believed to have re|mained a very short while in that State. She gave him also five drops of Blood in the form of a Cross, which were <HI>Tears</HI> of Blood, that she had shed while her Son was on the Cross. And, to convince him more fully, she presented an <HI>Hostie</HI> to him, that appeared to as an ordinary Hostie, and of a sudden it appeared be of a deep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed colour. The cheat of those supposed vi|sits was often repeated to the abused <HI>Fryer</HI>; at last the <HI>Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|gin</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">old him, that she was to give him such ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ks of her Sons Love to him, that the matter should be past all doub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.
<PB N="27" REF="27">
She said, that the five wounds of St. <HI>Lucia,</HI> and S. <HI>Catha|rine,</HI> were real wounds, and that she would also imprint them on him; so she bid him reach his hand; he had no great mind to receive a favour in which he was to suffer so much: but she forced his hand, and struck a nail thro it, the hole was as big as a grain of pease, and he saw the Candle clearly thro it; this threw him out of a supposed transport into a real Agony; but she seemed to touch his hand, and he thought he smelt an Oyntment, with which she anointed it, tho his <HI>Confess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r</HI> perswaded him, that that was only an imagination, so the supposed <HI>Virgin</HI> lest him for that time.</P>
<P>The next night the Apparition returned, and brought some linnen Clothes, which had some real or imagi|nary vertue to allay his Torment: and the pretended <HI>Virgin</HI> said, they were some of the Linnings in which Christ was wrapped, and with that she gave him a soporiferous draught, and while he was fast asleep, the other four wounds were, inprinted on his body, in such a manner that he felt no pain.</P>
<P>But in order to the doing of this, the <HI>Friers</HI> betook themselves to Charms, and the <HI>Subpri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r</HI> shewed the rest a book full of them; but he said, that before they could be effectual, they must renounce God&punc; and he not only did this himself, but by a formal act put in writing signed with his Blood<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, he dedicated himself to the Deyl; it is true, he did not oblige the rest to this, but only to renounce God. The composition of the Draught was a mixture of some Fountain-water and Chrism, the Hairs of the Eyebrows of a Child, some Qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ksilver, some grains of Incense, somewhat of an Easter Wax Can|dle, some consecrated Salt, and the Blood of an unbap|tised Child. This Composition was a secret, which the <HI>Subprior</HI> did not communicate to the other <HI>Friers.</HI> By this the poor Frier <HI>Ietzer</HI> was made almost quite insensible: when he was awake, and came out of this deep sleep, he felt this wonderful im|pression on his body: and now he was ravished out
<PB N="28" REF="28">
of measure, and came to fancy himself to be acting all the parts of our Saviours Passion: he was exposed to the peo|ple on the great Altar, to the amasement of the whole Town, and to the no small mortification of the <HI>Francis|cans.</HI> The <HI>Dominicans</HI> gave him some other draughts that threw him into convulsions, and when he came out of those, a voice was heard, which came thro that <HI>hole</HI> which yet remains, and runs from one of the <HI>Cells</HI> along a great part of the wall of the <HI>Church</HI>: for a <HI>Frier</HI> spoke thro a pipe, and at the End of the hole there was an <HI>Image</HI> of the <HI>Virgins,</HI> with a little <HI>Iesus</HI> in her arms, between whom and his mother the voice seemed to come; the Image also seemed to shed Tears, and a Painter had drawn those on her Face so lively, that the people where deceived by it. The little Jesus askt, why she wept? and she said, it was because his honour was given to her, since it was said, that she was born without sin; in Conclusion, the <HI>Fryers</HI> did so over act this matter, that at last even the poor deluded <HI>Fryer</HI> himself came to discover it, and resol|ved to quit the order.</P>
<P>It was in vain to delude him with more <HI>Apparitions</HI>; for he well nigh kill'd a <HI>Fryer</HI> that came to him personating the <HI>Virgin</HI> in another shape with a Crown on her head: he also over-heard the <HI>Fryers</HI> once talking amongst them|selves, of the Contrivance and Success of the imposture, so plainly, that he discovered the whole Matter, and upon that, as may be easily imagined, he was filled with all the horror with which such a Discovery could inspire him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fryers</HI> fearing that an imposture, which was car|ried on hitherto with so much success, should be quite spoiled, and be turned against them, thought the surest way was to own the whole Matter to him, and to engage him to carry on the Cheat. They told him in what esteem he would be, if he continued to support the reputation tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he had acquired, that he would become the chief person of the <HI>Order</HI>; and in the end they persuaded him to go on with the Imposture: but at last, they fearing lest he
<PB N="29" REF="28">
should discover all, resolved to poyson him; of which he was so apprehensive, that once a Loaf being brought him that was prepared with some spices, he kept it for some time, and it growing green, he threw it to some young Wolves Whelps that were in the Monastery, who died immediately. His constitution was also so vigorous, that tho they gave him Poyson five several times, he was not destroyed by it; they also prest him earnestly to re|nounce God, which they judged necessary, that so their Charms might have their effect on him; but he would ne|ver consent to that: at last they forced him to take a poy|soned <HI>Hostie,</HI> which yet he vomited up soon after he had swallowed it down; that failing, they used him so cruel|ly, whipping him with an iron Chain, and girding him about so strait with it, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o avoid further Torment he swore to them, in a most imprecating stile, that he would never discover the secret, but would still carry it on; and so he deluded them till he sound an opportunity of g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tting out of the <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vent,</HI> and of throwing himself in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o the hands of the <HI>Magistr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tes,</HI> to whom he discovered all.</P>
<P>The four <HI>Fryers</HI> were seised on, and put in prison, and an account of the whole Matter was sent, first to the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Lausanne,</HI> and then to <HI>Rome</HI>; and it may be easily imagined, that the <HI>Franciscans</HI> took all possible care to have it well examined; the <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Lausan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> and of <HI>Zyon,</HI> with the <HI>Provin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ial</HI> of the <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ans,</HI> were&punc; ap|pointed to form the Process. The four <HI>Fryers</HI> first excep|ted to <HI>Ietzers</HI> credit; but that was rejected: then being threatned with the <HI>Question,</HI> they put in a long plea a|gainst that; but tho the <HI>Provincial</HI> would not consent to that, yet they were put to the question; some endured it long; but at last, they all confessed the whole progress of the Imposture. The <HI>Provincial</HI> appeared concerned; for tho <HI>Ietzer</HI> had opened the whole Matter to him, yet he would give no credit to him; on the contrary, he Char|ged him to be obedient to them, and one of the <HI>Friers</HI> said plainly, that he was in the whole secret, and so he with|drew; but he died some dayes after at <HI>Constance,</HI> having
<PB N="30" REF="29" MS="y">
poyson'd himself, as was believed. The Matter lay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sleep some time, but a year after that, a <HI>Spanish Bi|shop</HI> came, authorised with full power from <HI>Rome</HI>; and the whole Cheat being fully proved, the four <HI>Friers</HI> were solemnly degraded from their <HI>Priesthood,</HI> and Eight dayes after, it being the last of <HI>May</HI> 1509. they were <HI>Burnt</HI> in a Medow, on the other side of the River, over against the great <HI>Church</HI>; The place of their <HI>Exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ution</HI> was shewed me, as well as the Hole in the Wall, thro which the <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ice</HI> was Conveyed to the <HI>Image.</HI> It was certainly one of the blackest, and yet the best Carried on Cheat, that has been ever known; and no doubt had the poor <HI>Fryer</HI> died, be|fore the discovery, it had pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed down to <HI>posterity,</HI> as one of the greatest <HI>Miracles</HI> that ever was; and it gives a shrewd suspition, that many of the other <HI>Miracles,</HI> of that <HI>Church,</HI> were of the same nature, but more successfully finished.</P>
<P>I shall not entertain you any further with the <HI>State of Bern,</HI> but shall only add one general remark: which was too visible not to be observed every where, and of too great importance not to deserve a particular re|flection: it belongs in general to all the <HI>Cantons,</HI> but I give it here, because I had more occasion to make it in <HI>Bern,</HI> having seen it more, and stayed lon|ger in it, than in the other <HI>Cantons.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Chapter</HI> are likewise still continued as a corporation, and enjoy the <HI>revenues</HI> which they had be|fore the <HI>Reformation</HI>; but if they subsist plentifully, they labour hard; for they have generally two or three Ser|mons a day, and at least one: the first begins at five a clock in the morning. At <HI>Geneva,</HI> and all <HI>Switserland</HI> over, there are daily Sermons, which were substituted upon the <HI>Reformation</HI> from the Mass. But the Sermons are generally too long, and the Preachers have departed from the first design of these Sermons, which were inten|ded to be an explication of a whole Chapter, and an exhortation upon it; and if this were so contrived, that it were in all not above a quarter of an hour long, as it would be heard by the People with less Weariness and more profit, so it would be a vast Advantage to the Prea|chers; For as it would oblige them to study the Scriptures much, so having once made themselves Masters of the practical parts of the Scripture, such short and simple Discourses would cost them less pains, than those more laboured Sermons do, which consume the greatest part of their time, and too often to very little purpose.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>Archives</HI> of the <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Chapter,</HI> there is a vast Collection of <HI>Letters,</HI> written either to <HI>Bullinger,</HI> or by him; they are bound up, and make a great many <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lums in Folio,</HI> and out of these no doubt but one might discover a great many particulars relating to the <HI>History of the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">formati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m</HI>: For as <HI>Bullinger</HI> lived long, so he was much esteemed.

<PB N="37" REF="32">
constant Correspondence with <HI>Bullinger,</HI> after the happy re-establishment of the <HI>Reformation</HI> under <HI>Queen Elisa|beth:</HI> Of which I read almost a <HI>whole Volum</HI> while I was there: Most of them contain only the general news, but some were more important, and relate to the Disputes then on foot, concerning the <HI>Habits of the Clergy,</HI> which gave the first beginnings to our unhappy Divisions: and by the <HI>Letters,</HI> of which I read the <HI>Originals,</HI> it appears, that the <HI>Bishops</HI> preserved the ancient <HI>Habits</HI> rather in compliance with the <HI>Queens</HI> inclinations, than out of a|ny liking they had to them; so far they were from liking them, that they plainly exprest their dislike of them. <HI>Ie|wel,</HI> in a <HI>Letter</HI> bearing date the 8. of <HI>February</HI> 1566. wishes, <HI>that the Vestments, together with all the other Remnants of Popery, might be thrown both out of their Churches, and out of the minds of the People</HI>; and laments the <HI>Queens</HI> fixedness to them, so that she would suffer no change to be made. And, in <HI>Ianuary</HI> of the same year, <HI>Sands</HI> writes to the same purpose. <HI>Contenditur de vestibus Papisti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">is utendis vel non utendis, dabit Deus his quoque finem. Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">putes are now on foot concerning the</HI> Popish Vest|ments, <HI>whether they should be used or not; but God will put an end to those things. Horn,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Win<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hester,</HI> went further; For in a <HI>Letter,</HI> dated the 16th of <HI>Iuly,</HI> 1565. He writes of the <HI>Act</HI> concerning the <HI>Habits,</HI> with great regret, and expresses some hopes that it might be <HI>repealed</HI> next <HI>Session of Parliament,</HI> if the <HI>Popish Party</HI> did not hinder it; and he seems to stand in doubt, whether he should conform himself to it or not; upon which he de|sires <HI>Bullingers</HI> Advice. And in many <HI>Letters</HI> writ on that subject, it is asserted, that both <HI>Cranmer</HI> and <HI>Ridley</HI> intended to procure an <HI>Act</HI> for abolishing the <HI>Habits,</HI> and that they only defended their <HI>Lawfulness,</HI> but not their <HI>Fitness;</HI> and therefore they blamed private Persons that refused to obey the Laws. <HI>Grindal</HI> in a Letter dated the 27th of <HI>August,</HI> 1566. writes, That all the <HI>Bishops,</HI> who had been beyond Sea, had at their return dealt wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the <HI>Queen</HI> to let the matter of the <HI>Habits</HI> fall: but she was
<PB N="38" REF="33" MS="y">
so prepossessed, that tho they had all endeavoured to di|vert her from prosecuting that matter, she continued still inflexible. This had made them resolve to submit to the <HI>Laws,</HI> and to wait for a fit opportunity to <HI>rever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e them.</HI> He laments the ill effects of the opposition that some had made to them, which had extreamly irritated the <HI>Queens</HI> Spirit, so that <HI>She</HI> was now much more heated in those matters than formerly; he also thanks <HI>Bullinger</HI> for the <HI>Letter</HI> that he had writ, justifying the <HI>Lawful use</HI> of the <HI>Habits,</HI> which he says had done great service. <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">x,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Ely,</HI> in one of his <HI>Letters,</HI> laments the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er|sion that they found in the <HI>Parliament</HI> to all the <HI>Prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">si|tions</HI> that were made for the Reformation of Abuses. <HI>Ie|wel,</HI> in a Letter dated the 22th of <HI>May</HI> 1559. writes, That the <HI>Queen</HI> refused to be called <HI>Head o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Church,</HI> and adds, That that <HI>Title</HI> could not be justly given to any mortal, it being due only to <HI>Christ</HI>; and that such Titles had been so much abused by <HI>Antichrist,</HI> that they ought not to be any longer continued. On all these <HI>Passa|ges</HI> I will make no reflections here: For I set them down only to shew what was the sense of our Chief <HI>Church-men</HI> at that time concerning those matters, which have since engaged us into such warm and angry Disputes; and this may be no inconsiderable instruction to one, that intends to write the <HI>History</HI> of that time. The last particu|lar, with which I intend to end this <HI>Letter,</HI> might seem a little too learned, if I were writing to a less knowing Man than your self.</P>

and killed him with the same Ax, which they brought along with them, that they might execute their design by the same Tool with which their Friend was murthe|red. <HI>Ganatz</HI> had during the <HI>Wars</HI> abandoned both his <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ligion</HI> and <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fession,</HI> being indeed a disgrace to both, and had served first in the <HI>Venetian,</HI> and then in the <HI>Spanish</HI> Troops: After the peace was made, he became so considerable, being supported by the <HI>Spanish</HI> Faction, that he was chosen <HI>Governour</HI> of <HI>Chaven|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> and was come over to <HI>Coire</HI> to a <HI>Diet,</HI> he be|ing then in so important a charge: but he was so much hated, that tho the muthering of a <HI>Magistrate</HI> in Office, and at a publick <HI>Assembly</HI> in so terrible a man|ner, ought to have been severely pun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">shed, yet no inquiry was made into the Crime, nor was any Man so much as questioned for it. In that <HI>Chamber</HI> many that were put to the <HI>Question,</HI> confessed enough to hang them; some indured the <HI>Question,</HI> and escaped with the loss of the use of their Arms.

<P>There is a sort of <HI>Wine</HI> here and in the <HI>Valteline,</HI> which I never heard named any where else, that is called <HI>Aro|matick-wine</HI>; and as the taste makes one think it must be a composition (for it tastes like a <HI>Strong-water</HI> drawn of <HI>Spi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es</HI>) so its strength being equal to a weak <HI>Brandy,</HI> disposes one to believe that it cannot be a natural <HI>Wine,</HI> and yet it is the pure juice of the <HI>Grape,</HI> without any mixture.

and is about two mile Diameter. This <HI>Lake</HI> falls into the <HI>Lake</HI> of <HI>Como,</HI> over against the Fort <HI>Fuentes</HI>; when we passed there, the Water was so low, that the Boat could not easily get over a Bank that lay between the two <HI>Lakes.</HI> The <HI>Lake</HI> of <HI>Como</HI> is about eight and forty miles long, and four broad; it runs between two ranges of Hills: I did nor stay long enough in <HI>Como</HI> to give any Description of it; for I thought to have returned that way from a little Tour that I made into the <HI>Bailiages</HI> that the <HI>Switzers</HI> have in <HI>Italy,</HI> of <HI>Lugane, Locarmo,</HI> and <HI>Bellinzona:</HI> but I took another Course, so I saw nothing in <HI>Como</HI>; the best thing in it is a fine <HI>Chappel,</HI> which the present <HI>Pope,</HI> who is a Native of <HI>Como,</HI> is building.

But that which is above all the rest, she is a person of extraor|dinary Devotion, great resignation to the Will of God, and a profound humility: The <HI>Preceptor,</HI> that her Father kept in the house with her, hath likewise a wonderful Faculty of acquiring <HI>Tongues.</HI> When he came first to <HI>Ge|neva</HI> (for he is of <HI>Zurich</HI>) he spoke not a word of <HI>French,</HI> and within thirteen Months he preacht in <HI>French</HI> correctly, and with a good Accent: He also began to study <HI>Italian</HI> in the Month of <HI>November,</HI> and before the end of the fol|lowing <HI>February</HI> he preacht in <HI>Italian</HI>; his accent was good, and his stile was floried, which was very extraor|dinary; for the <HI>Italian</HI> Language is not spoken in <HI>Geneva,</HI> tho the race of the <HI>Italians</HI> do keep up still an <HI>Italian Church</HI> there.</P>

For <HI>Lombardy,</HI> which was so long the seat of War, could not stand out against a good Army now so many dayes, as it did then years. The Garrison of <HI>Crema,</HI> which is the first of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Territory, is no better than that of <HI>Lodi,</HI> only the People in the <HI>Venetian Domi|nion</HI> live happier than under the <HI>Spaniard.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Senate</HI> sends <HI>Podesta</HI>'s, much like the <HI>Bailifs</HI> of the <HI>Switzers,</HI> who order the Ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ice and the Civil Go|vernment of the <HI>Iurisdiction</HI> assigned them: There is also a <HI>Captain-Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ral,</HI> who hath the <HI>Military Authority</HI> in his hands; and these two are Checks upon one another; as the <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'s</HI> and the <HI>Cadi's</HI> are among the <HI>Turks.</HI> But here in <HI>Crema,</HI> the Town is so small, that both these are in one person. We were there in the time of the <HI>Fair; Linnen Cloath,</HI> and <HI>Cheese</HI> (which tho it goes by the name

of the <HI>Parmesan,</HI> is made chief<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y in <HI>Lodi</HI>) are the main Commodities of the Fair. The magnificence of the <HI>Pode|sta</HI> appeared very extraordinary; for he went through the Fair with a great Train of Coaches, all in his own Live|ry; and the two Coaches, in which he and his Lady ride, were both extraordinary rich: his was a huge Bed-coach, all the out-side black Velvet, and a mighty rich Gold Fringe, lined with black Damask, flowered with Gold. From <HI>Crema</HI> it is thirty Miles to <HI>Bres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ia,</HI> which is a great Town, and full of Trade and Wealth; here they make the best <HI>Barrils</HI> for <HI>Pistols</HI> and <HI>Muskers</HI> of all <HI>Italy:</HI> there are great Iron Works near it; but the <HI>War</HI> with the <HI>Turk</HI> had occasioned an order, that none might be sold without a Permission from <HI>Venice:</HI> They are buil|ding a Noble <HI>Dome</HI> at <HI>Brescia</HI>: I was shewed a <HI>Nunnery</HI> there, which is now under a great Disgrace; some <HI>years</HI> ago, a new <HI>Bishop</HI> coming thither, began with the Visi|tation of that <HI>Nunnery</HI>; he discovered two <HI>Vauits,</HI> by one, <HI>Men</HI> came ordinarily into it; and by another, the <HI>Nuns</HI> that were big, went and lay in of Child-bed: when he was examining the <HI>Nuns</HI> severely concerning those <HI>Vaults,</HI> some of them told him, that his own <HI>Priests</HI> did much worse. He shut up the <HI>Nuns,</HI> so that those who are profef|sed live still there, but none come to take the Vail: and by this means the House will soon come to an end. The <HI>Cit|tadel</HI> lies over the Town on a Rock, and commands it ab|solutely. Both here, and in <HI>Crema,</HI> the Towns have begun a Complement within these last ten or twelve years to their <HI>Podesta</HI>'s, which is matter of great Ornament to their <HI>Palaces,</HI> but will grow to a vast charge; for they erect <HI>Sta|tues</HI> to their <HI>Podesta</HI>'s: and this being once bogun, must be carried on; otherwise those to whom the like honour is not done, will resent it as a high affront; and the Revenges of the <HI>Noble Venetians</HI> are dread<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ul things to their Subjects. This name of <HI>Podesta</HI> is very ancient; for in the <HI>Roman</HI> times, the chief <HI>Magistrates</HI> of the lesser <HI>Towns</HI> were call|ed the <HI>Potestas</HI>&punc; as appears by that of <HI>Iuvenal, Fidena|rum Gabiorumve esse Potestas.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="58" MS="y">From <HI>Brescia,</HI> the beauty of <HI>Lombardy</HI> is a little inter|rupted; for as all the way from <HI>Milan</HI> to <HI>Brescia</HI> is as one Garden, so here on the one side we come under the <HI>Mountains,</HI> and we pass by the <HI>Lake</HI> of <HI>Guarda,</HI> which is forty miles long, and where it is broadest, is twenty miles over: The <HI>Miles</HI> indeed, all <HI>Lombardy</HI> over, are extream short; for I walkt often four or five Miles in a walk, and I found a thousand paces made their common Mile; but in <HI>Tuscany</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Napels,</HI> the mile is fifteen hundred paces. We pass through a great Heath for seven or eight miles on this side of <HI>Verona,</HI> which begins to be cultivated. <HI>Verona</HI> is a vast Town, and much of it well built; there are many rich <HI>Chur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hes</HI> in it: but there is so little Trade stirring, and so little money going, that it is not easie here to change a <HI>Pistol,</HI> without taking their Coyn of base Alloy, which doth not pass out of the <HI>Veronese</HI>: for this seems a strange Maxim of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> to suffer those small <HI>States,</HI> to retain still a Coyn peculiar to them, which is extream inconvenient for Commerce. The known Antiquity of <HI>Verona</HI> is the <HI>Amphitheater,</HI> one of the least of all that the <HI>Romans</HI> built, but the best pre|served; for tho most of the great Stones of the outside are pickt out; yet the great flopping <HI>Vault,</HI> on which the rows of the seats are laid, is intire; the rows of the sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s are also intire, they are sour and forty Rows; every Row is a foot and half high, and as much in breadth, so that a Man sits conveniently in them under the feet of those of the higher Row: &amp; allowing every Man a foot and a half, the whole <HI>Amphitheather</HI> can hold twenty three thousand Persons. In the <HI>Vaults,</HI> under the Rows of Seats, were the stalls of the <HI>Beasts</HI> that were presented to entertain the Company: the thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kness of the Building, from the out|ward Wall to the lowest Row of Seats, is ninty foot: But this Noble Remnant of <HI>Antiquity,</HI> is so often, and so co|piously described, that I will say no more of it. The ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t thing of value is the famous <HI>Museum Calceolarium,</HI> now in the Hands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">of the <HI>Count Mascardo,</HI> where there is a whole Apartment of <HI>Rooms,</HI> all furnisht with <HI>Antiquities,</HI> and

<HI>Rarities.</HI> There are some old Inscriptions, made by two Towns in <HI>Africk,</HI> to the honour of <HI>M. Crassus</HI>: There is a great Collection of <HI>Medals</HI> and <HI>Medaillons,</HI> and of the <HI>Roman Weights,</HI> with their Instruments for theit <HI>Sa|crifices</HI>; there are many Curiosities of Nature, and a great Collection of <HI>Pictur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> of which many are of <HI>Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lo Veronese</HI>'s Hand. There is a noble Garden in <HI>Verona,</HI> that riseth up in Terrasses the whole height of a Hill, in which thete are many ancient Inscriptions, which belongs to <HI>Count Giusto.</HI> As we go from <HI>Verona</HI> to <HI>Vin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enza,</HI> which is thirty miles, we return to the Beauty of <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mbardy</HI>; for there is all the way as it were a Succession of Gardens: the ground is better cultivated here, than I saw it in any other place of <HI>Italy</HI>: But the <HI>Wine</HI> is not good; for at the roots of all their Trees they plant a Vine; which grows up winding about the Tree, to which it joyns; but the Soil is too rich to produce a rich wine; for that requi|reth a dry ground. There is near the <HI>Lake</HI> of <HI>Guarda</HI> a very extraordinary <HI>Wine,</HI> which they call <HI>Vino Santo,</HI> which drinks like the best sort of <HI>Canary,</HI> it is not made till <HI>Christmaes,</HI> and from thence it carries the Name of <HI>Holy Wine</HI>; and it is not to be drunk till <HI>Midsummer</HI>; for it is so long before it is quite wrought cleat; but I have not ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ked down how long it may be kept: we had it there for a Groat an <HI>English</HI> quart; I wondred that they did not trade with it. All the <HI>Cattel</HI> of <HI>Italy</HI> are gray or white, and all their <HI>Hogs</HI> are black, except in the <HI>Bologn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se,</HI> and there they are red. I will not inquire into the reasons of these things: it is certain, <HI>Hogs-Flesh</HI> in <HI>Italy</HI> is much better than it is in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> whether the truffs on which they feed much in Winter, occasion this or not, I know not; the Husks of the pressed G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">apes is also a mighty nourishment to them; but Cattel of that grayish colour, are certainly weaker: The Carriage of <HI>Italy</HI> is generally performed by them; and this is very hard work in <HI>Lombar|dy,</HI> when it hath rained ever so little; for the ground being quite level, and there being no raised High-wayes or Cause-wayes, the Carts go deep, and are hardly drawn.</P>

We were at <HI>Vincenza</HI> upon a Holy day, and there I saw a preparation for a Procession that was to be in the after|noon: I did not wonder at what a <HI>French Papist</HI> said to me, that he could hardly bear the <HI>Religion of Italy,</HI> the <HI>Idolatry</HI> in it was so gross. The <HI>Statue</HI> of the <HI>Virgi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> was of Wood, so finely painted, that I thought the head was Wax; it was richly clad, and had a Crown on its Head, and was set full of Flowers: how they did when it was carried about, I do not know; but in the morning all people ran to it, and said their prayers to it, and Kissed the Ground be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore it, with all the appearances of Devotion.</P>

the Air is extream good, and there is so great a plenty of all things, except Money, that a little Money goes a great way.

The <HI>Ve|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etians</HI> have been willing to let the ancient Quarrels that were in all those conquered Cities continue still among them; for while one kills another, and the Children of the other take their <HI>Revenges</HI> afterwards, both comes un|der the <HI>Bando</HI> by this means, and the Confisca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion goes to the <HI>Senate.</HI> At some times of <HI>Grace,</HI> when the Senate wants Money, and offers a pardon to all that will com|pound for it, the numbers of the guilty persons are incredi|ble. In <HI>Vincenza,</HI> and the Country that belongs to it, I was assured by <HI>Monsieur Patin,</HI> that learned Autiquary, that hath been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">any years a <HI>Professor</HI> in <HI>Padua,</HI> that there were five and thirty thousand pardoned at the last <HI>Grace</HI>; this I could hardly believe, but he bid me write it down upon his word. The <HI>Nobility</HI> of <HI>Padua,</HI> and of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he other <HI>Towns,</HI> seem not to see what a profit their Quarrels bring to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and how they eat out their Families: for one <HI>Family</HI> in the same mans time, who was alive while I was there, was reduced from fourteen thousand <HI>Ducats</HI> Revenue, to less than three thousand, by its falling at several times under the <HI>Bando</HI>&punc; But their Jealou|sies and their Revenges are pursued by them with so much vigour, that when these are in their way, all other things are forgot by them.

yet on all hands round about them, the Oppressions being more intolerable, they know not whither to go for ease; whereas on the contrary, the miseries under which their Neighbours groan, chiefly those of the <HI>Ecclesiastical State,</HI> send in an increase of people among them, so that they are well stoekt with people; but the <HI>Venetians</HI> are so jealous of their Subjects understanding <HI>Military</HI> matters, which may dispose them to revolt, that they never make any Levies among them for their <HI>Wars</HI>; this jealousie is the true ground of that maxim, tho another is pretended, that is more plausible, which is, their Care of their own people, whom they study to preserve, and therefore they hire Strangers, rather than expose their Subjects.

as he is elsewhere. I asked for his Tomb, but they made no account of him, and seemed not to know where it was; it is true, the person to whom I was recommen|ded, was not in <HI>Venice,</HI> so perhaps they refined too much in this matter: I had great Discourse with some at <HI>Venice</HI> concerning the <HI>Memorials</HI> out of which <HI>F. Paul</HI> drew his <HI>History,</HI> which are no doubt all preserved with great care in their <HI>Archives</HI>; and since the Transactions of the <HI>Coun|cil of Trent,</HI> as they are of great Importance, so they are become now much controverted, by the different Rela|tions that <HI>F. Paul,</HI> and <HI>Cardinal Pallavicini</HI> have given the World of that matter; the only way to put an end to all Disputes in matter of Fact, is to print the <HI>Ori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inals</HI> themselves. A Person of great Credit at <HI>Venice,</HI> promised to me, to do his utmost, to get that Proposition set on foot, tho the great Exactness that the <HI>Government</HI> there hath alwayes affected, as to the matter of their <HI>Archives,</HI> is held so sacred, that this made him apprehend, they would not give way to any such search. The Affinity of the matter brings into my mind a long Conversation that I had with a person of great Eminence at <HI>Venice,</HI> that as he was long at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> so he was learned far beyond what is to be met with in <HI>Italy</HI>; he told me, he was at <HI>Constantinople</HI> when the Inquiry into the Doctrine of the <HI>Greek Church</HI> was set on foot, occasioned by the famous Dispute between <HI>Mr. Arnaud</HI> and <HI>Mr. Claude</HI> he being a zealous <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> was dealt with to assist in that business; but being a Man of great Honour and Sincerity, he excused himself, and said, he could not meddle in it: He hath a very low and bad Opinion of the <HI>Greeks</HI>; and he told me, <HI>That none of their</HI> Priests <HI>were more inveterate Enemies to the</HI> Church of Rome <HI>than those that were bred up at</HI> Rome; for they, to free them|selves of the prejudices that their Countreymen are apt to conceive against them, because of their Education among the <HI>Latines,</HI> do affect to shew an Opposition to the <HI>La|tin Church</HI> beyond any other <HI>Greeks.</HI> He told me, that he knew the Ignorance and Corruption of the <HI>Greeks</HI> was
<PB N="98" REF="63" MS="y">
such, that as they did not know the Doctrines of their own <HI>Church,</HI> so a very little Money, or the hope of Pro|tection from any of the <HI>Ambass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dors</HI> that came from the <HI>West,</HI> would prevail with them to sign any thing that could be desired of them. He added one thing, that tho he firmly believed <HI>Transu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stantiation</HI> himself, he did not think they believed it, let them say what they pleased themselves; he took his measures of the Doctrine of their <HI>Church,</HI> rather from what they did, than from what they said: For their <HI>Rites</HI> not being changed now for a great many ages, were the true Indications of the Do|ctrines received among them; whereas they were both ignorant of the Tradition of their Doctrine, and very apt to prevericate when they saw Advantages or Protection set before them; therefore he concluded, that since they did not adore the <HI>Sacrament</HI> after the Consecration, that was an evident sign that they did not believe the <HI>Corporal Presence</HI>; and was of a force well able to balance all their Subscriptions: He told me, he was often scandalized to see them open the Bag, in which the <HI>Sacrament</HI> was preser|ved, and shew it with no sort of respect, no more than when they shewed any <HI>Manuscript</HI>; and he looked on <HI>Adoration</HI> as such a necessary Consequent of <HI>Transu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">stan|tiation,</HI> that he could not imagine that the latter was re|ceived in a <HI>Church</HI> that did not practise the former. To this I will add what an Eminent <HI>Catholick</HI> at <HI>Paris</HI> told me; he said, the <HI>Originals</HI> of those Attestations, were in too exact and too correct a stile, to have been formed in <HI>Greece</HI>; he assured me, they were penned at <HI>Paris,</HI> by one that was a Master of the Purity of the <HI>Greek</HI> Tongue, I do not name these Persons, because they are yet alive, and this might be a prejudice to them. One of the chief Ornaments of <HI>Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ice</HI> was the famous young <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">man</HI> that spake five <HI>Tongues</HI> well, of which the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e two; she passed Doctor of Physick at <HI>Padua,</HI> accor|ding to the ordinary Forms; but which was beyond all, she was a person of such extraordinary Vertue and Piety, that she is spoken of as a Saint; she died some Months

before I came to <HI>Venice</HI>: she was of the noble Family of the <HI>Cornaro's,</HI> tho not of the three chief Branches, which are <HI>Saint Maurice,</HI> Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> and <HI>Calle,</HI> who are de|scended from the three Brothers of the renowned <HI>Queen</HI> of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> but the distinction of her Family was <HI>Pisco|pia.</HI> Her extraordinary merit made all people unwil|ling to remember the blemish of her descent of the one side; for tho the <HI>Cornaro's</HI> re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">kon themselves a size of <HI>Nobility</HI> beyond all the other Families of <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nice,</HI> yet her Father having entertained a <HI>Goudalier</HI>'s Daughter so long, that he had some Children by her, at last for their sakes married the Mother, and payed a considerable Fine to save the forfeiture of <HI>Nobility,</HI> which his Children must have undergone, by reason of the meanness of the Mothers birth. The <HI>Cornaro's</HI> carry it so high, that many of the Daughters of that <HI>Family</HI> have made themselves <HI>Nuns,</HI> because they thought their own Name was so No|ble, that they could not induce themselves to change it with any other; and when lately one of that Family mar|ried the Heir of the <HI>Sagredro,</HI> which is also one of the an|tientest Families, that was extream rich, and she had scarce any portion at all, (for the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rnaro's</HI> are now very low) some of their Friends came to wish them joy of so advanta|gious a Match; but they very coldly rejected the Comple|ment, and bid the others go and wish the <HI>Sagredo's</HI> joy, since they thought the Advantage was wholly of their side.</P>
<P>There are of the truly Ancient Noble Families of <HI>Veni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> four and twenty yet remaining, and even among these, there are twelve that are thought superior to the rest in rank: since the first Formation of their <HI>Senate,</HI> they have created many <HI>Senators.</HI> In their Wars with <HI>Genua</HI> they conferred that honour on thirty Families: several of their <HI>Generals</HI> have had that honour given them as a reward of their service: They have also offered this honour to some Royal Families; for both the Pamilies of <HI>Valo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> and <HI>Bourbon,</HI> were Nobles of <HI>Venice;</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the III. when he came through <HI>Venice</HI> from <HI>Poland,</HI> to take pos|session of the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> went and sate among

them, and drew his <HI>Ballot</HI> as a Noble <HI>Venetian</HI>: many <HI>Popes</HI> have procured this honour for their <HI>Nephews.</HI> Only the <HI>Barberines</HI> would have the <HI>Venetians</HI> offer it to them without their asking it, and the <HI>Veneti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns</HI> would not give it without the others asked it, and so it stuck at this.

In all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he Creations of <HI>Se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ators</HI> before the last War of <HI>Can|dy,</HI> they were free; and the Considerations were, either great Services, or the great Dignity of those on whom they bestowed this Honour. Those new Families are di|vided into those that are called <HI>Ducal Families</HI>; and those that were called simply <HI>New Families</HI>; the Reason of the former designation is not rightly understood; but one that knew all that related to that Constitution particularly well, gave me a good account of it. That which natu|rally occurs as the Reason of it, is, that all those Fami|lies, that are called <HI>Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al,</HI> have had the <HI>Dukedom</HI> in their House: But as all the <HI>old Families</HI> have had the same Honour, though they carry not that Title, so some of the <HI>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w Families</HI> have also had it, that yet are not cal|led <HI>Ducal.</HI> Others say, that those Families that have had branches, who have been made <HI>Dukes,</HI> without their being first <HI>Procurators of S. Mark,</HI> or that have been cho|sen to that Honour, without their pretending to it, are called <HI>Ducal</HI>: But the true Account of this is, that from the year 1450. to the year 1620. for a hundred and se|venty years, there was a combination made among those <HI>new</HI> Families to preserve the <HI>Dukedom</HI> still among them: For the <HI>old</HI> Families carrying it high, and excluding the <HI>new</HI> Families from the chief Honours, nineteen of the <HI>new</HI> Families entred into mutual Ingagements to exclude the ancient <HI>Nobility</HI>: It is true, they made the <HI>Dukedom</HI> sometimes fall on some of the <HI>new</HI> Families that were not of this Association; but this was more indifferent to them, as long as the ancient Famillies were shut out, and that
<PB N="101" REF="64">
it appeared, that they bore the chief sway in the Election, This Combination was a thing known to the very people, tho the <HI>Inquisitors</HI> did all they could to break it, or at least to hide it, so that I never met with it in any of their Authors. But this failed in the year 1620. when <HI>Memmio</HI> was chosen <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke,</HI> who was descended of one of the an|cient <HI>Nobility,</HI> which was so great a mortification to the <HI>Case Ducale,</HI> that one of them (<HI>Veniero</HI>) hanged him|self, by the Rage to which that Disgrace drove him, yet his man came into the room in time, before he was dead, and cut him down, and he lived long after that in a better mind. Since that time, one of the <HI>Bembo's,</HI> two of the <HI>Cornaro's,</HI> and one of the <HI>Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tarini's,</HI> and the present Prince, of the <HI>Iust<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">niani,</HI> the first of that family that hath had that honour, have been <HI>Dukes,</HI> who are all of the ancient Families: So that this Faction is now so intirely buried, that it is not generally known (even in <HI>Veni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> it self) that it was ever amongst them; and thus time, and other <HI>Ac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nts</HI> bring about happy Events, which no Care n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r Industry could produce: For that which all the Endeavours of the <HI>Inquisit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs</HI> could not compass, was brought about of it self. It is true, the Factions in <HI>Veni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> tho violent enough in the persons of those who manage them, yet are not derived by them, as an Inheritance to their Posterity, as it was among the <HI>Florentines</HI>; who tho they value themselves as a size of men much above the <HI>Venetians,</HI> whom they despise as a phlegmatick and dull race of people, yet shewed how little they understood with all their vivacity, to conduct their <HI>State</HI>; since by their domestick Heats they lost their Liberty, which the <HI>Venetians</HI> have had the wisdom still to preserve. This Faction of the <HI>Case Ducale</HI> was perhaps willing to let the matter fall; for they lost more than they got by it; for the Ancient Families in revenge set them|selves against them, and excluded them from all the other advantagious Imployments of the <HI>State.</HI> For the others being only united in that single point relating to the <HI>Duke|dom,</HI> the Ancient Families let them carry it; but in all
<PB N="102" REF="65">
other Competitions they set up alwayes such Competitors against the Pretenders that were of the <HI>Ducal Families,</HI> that were much more esteemed than these were, so that they shut <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hem out of all the best Offices of the <HI>Republi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k.</HI> Such a Faction as this was, if it had been still kept up, might in Conclusion have proved fatal to their Liberty. It is indeed a Wonder to see, the Dignity of the <HI>Duke</HI> so much courted; for he is only a Prisoner of State, tyed up to such Rules, so severely restrained and shut up as it were in an Apartment of the <HI>Palace of S. Mark,</HI> that it is not strange to see some of the greatest Families, in parti|cular the <HI>Cornaro</HI>'s decline it. All the Family, if ever so numerous, must retire out of the <HI>Senate,</HI> when a <HI>Du<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> is chosen out of it, only one that is next to him of kin. sits still, but without a Vote: And the only Real Pri|viledge that the <HI>Duke</HI> hath, is, that he can of himself, without communicating with the <HI>Savii,</HI> propose mat|ters, either to the <HI>Council of Ten,</HI> to the <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nate,</HI> or to the <HI>Great Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">il</HI>; whereas all other proposi|tions must be first offered to the <HI>Savii,</HI> and examined by them, who have a sort of <HI>Tribunitian</HI> Power to reject what they dislike; and tho they cannot hinder the <HI>Duke</HI> to make a Proposition, yet they can mortifie him when he hath made it; they can hinder it to be voted; and after it is voted, they can suspend the execution of it till it is examined over again: And a <HI>Duke,</HI> that is of an active Spirit, must resolve to indure many of these A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">flictions; and it is certain, that the <HI>Savii,</HI> do sometimes affect to shew the Greatness of their Authority, and exercise a sort of Tyranny in the rejecting of Propositions, when thy intend to humble those that make them: yet the greatest part of the best Families court this Honour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f <HI>Dukedom</HI> extreamly. When <HI>Sagredo</HI> was upon the point of being chosen <HI>Duke,</HI> there was so violent an Out-cry against it over all <HI>Veni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e,</HI> because of the Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">grare, that they thought would come on the <HI>Republik,</HI> if they had a <HI>Prince,</HI> whose Nose had mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">carried in some unfortunate Dis|orders; the <HI>Senate</HI> complyed so far with this Aversion,

When an Election of <HI>Am|bassadors</HI> was proposed, or of any of the chief O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ices, it was wont to be made in those terms, that the <HI>Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">il</HI> must chuse one of its <HI>Principal Members</HI> for such an im|ployment: But because this lookt like a term of Di|stinction among the <HI>Nobility,</HI> they changed it five and twenty years ago; and instead of <HI>Principal,</HI> they use now the term <HI>Honourable,</HI> which comprehends the whole body of their <HI>Nobility,</HI> without any distinction. It is at <HI>Venice,</HI> in the <HI>Church,</HI> as well as in the <HI>State,</HI> that the <HI>Head</HI> of the <HI>Body</HI> hath a great Title; and particu|lar Honours done him; whereas in the mean while this is a

There is a <HI>Manu|script,</HI> in which some parts both of <HI>Tacitus</HI> and <HI>Apuleius</HI> are written, and in one place, one in a different hand had writ, that he had compared those <HI>Manuscripts,</HI> and he adds a date to this in <HI>Olibrius's</HI> time, which is about twelve hundred <HI>Years</HI> ago. I found some dipthongs in it cast into one Letter, which surprized me; for I thought that way of writing them had not been so ancient: but that which pleased me most was, that the <HI>Library-keeper</HI> assured me, that one had lately found <HI>the famous Epistle of St. Chrysostome to Cesarius in Greek,</HI> in the end of a Volume full of other things, and not among the <HI>Manuscripts</HI> of that <HI>Fathers Books</HI>; of which they have a great many. He thought he remembred well the place where the Book stood; so we turned over all the Books that stood near it, but I found it not: he promised to look it out for me, if I came back that way: But I changing my design, and going back another way, could not see the bottom of this. It is true, the fa|mous <HI>Magliabecchi,</HI> who is the <HI>Great Dukes</HI> Library-keeper, and is a person of most wonderful Civility, and full of Candor, as well as he is learned beyond imagi|nation, assured me, that this could be no other than a mi|stake of the <HI>Library-keepers</HI>; he said, such a discovery could not have been made, without making so much noise; that he must have heard of it. He added, there was not one man in <HI>Florence,</HI> that either understood <HI>Greek,</HI> or that examined <HI>Manuscripts</HI>; so that he assured me, I could not build on what an ignorant <HI>Library-keeper</HI> had told me: So I set down this matter as I found it, without building much on it. <HI>Florence</HI> is much sunk from what is was; for they do not reckon, that there are above fifty thousand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ouls in it: and the other <HI>States,</HI> that were once great <HI>Republicks,</HI> such as <HI>Siena</HI> and <HI>Pisa,</HI> while they retained their Liberty, are now shrunk almost into nothing: It is certain, that all

three together, are now not so numerous, as any one of them was two hundred years ago. <HI>Legorn</HI> is full of pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ple; and all round <HI>Florence</HI> there are a great many <HI>Villages</HI>; but as one goes over <HI>Tuscany,</HI> it appears so dispeopled, that one cannot but wonder to find a <HI>Coun|try,</HI> that hath been a Scene of so much Action, and so many <HI>Wars,</HI> now so forsaken, and so poor, and that in many places the Soil is quite neglected for want of hands to cultivate it; and in other places, where there are more people, they look so poor, and their Houses are such mise|rable Ruins, that it is scarce accountable, how there should be so much Poverty in so rich a <HI>Country,</HI> which is all over full of <HI>Beggars</HI>: and here the stile of Begging was a li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tle altered from what I found it in <HI>Lombardy</HI>; for where|as there they begged for the sake of <HI>St. Anthony,</HI> here all begged for <HI>the Souls that were in Purgatory</HI>; and this was the stile in all the other parts of <HI>Italy,</HI> through which I passed. In short; the dispeopling of <HI>Tuscany,</HI> and most of the <HI>Principalities of Italy,</HI> but chiefly of the <HI>Popes Do|minions,</HI> which are more abandoned than any other part of <HI>Italy,</HI> seemed to flow from nothing but the Severity of the <HI>Government</HI>; and the great Decay of <HI>Trade</HI>: For the greatest Trade of <HI>Italy</HI> being in <HI>Silk,</HI> the vast Impor|tation of <HI>Silks</HI> that the <HI>East-India Companies</HI> bring into <HI>Europe,</HI> hath quite ruined all those that deal in this Manufacture: Yet this is not the chief Cause of the dis|peopling of those rich <HI>Countrys</HI>; the Severity of the <HI>Tax</HI>&punc; is the true Reason: notwithstanding all that Decay of Trade, the Taxes are still kept up. Beside this, the vast Wealth of the <HI>Convents,</HI> where the only people of <HI>Italy</HI> are to be found, that live not only at their Ease, but in great plenty and Luxury, makes many forsake all sort of Industry, and seek for a retreat in one of those Seats of Pleasure; so that the People do not increase fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t enough to make a new race to come instead of those, whom a hard <HI>Government</HI> drives away. It must needs surprize an unattentive Traveller, to see not only the <HI>Venetian Territory,</HI> which is indeed a rich Country, but

the <HI>Bailiages</HI> of the <HI>Switzers,</HI> and the Coast of <HI>Ge|noa</HI> so full of People, when <HI>Tuscany,</HI> the <HI>Patrimo|ny,</HI> and the <HI>Kingdom of Naples,</HI> have so few Inha|bitants. In the Coast of <HI>Genoa,</HI> there is for many miles as it were a constant tract of <HI>Towns</HI> and <HI>Vil|lages,</HI> and all those are well peopled, tho they have scarce any Soil at all, lying under the <HI>Mountains,</HI> that are very barren, and that expose them to a most un|easy Sun; and that they lie upon a boistrous <HI>Sea</HI>; that is almost alwayes in a Storm, and that affords very few fish: and yet the Gentleness of the <HI>Government</HI> draws such multitudes thither, and those are so full of Wealth, that <HI>Mony</HI> goes at <HI>two per cent.</HI> But on the other hand, to ballance this a little, so strange and wild a thing is the nature of Man, at least of <HI>Italians,</HI> that I was told, that the worst people of all <HI>Italy</HI> are the <HI>Genoeses,</HI> and the most generally corrupted in their Morals, as to all sorts of Vice; so that tho a <HI>severe Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ernment</HI> and <HI>Slavery,</HI> are contrary to the nature of man, and to human Society, to <HI>Iu|stice</HI> and <HI>Equity,</HI> and to that essential Equality that Nature hath made among men; yet on the other hand, all men cannot bear that Ease and Liberty that become the Human Nature. The <HI>superstition</HI> of <HI>Italy,</HI> and the great wast of Wealth that one sees in their <HI>Chur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hes,</HI> par|ticularly those Prodigious Masses of <HI>Plate,</HI> with which their <HI>Altars</HI> are covered on Holydays, doth also sink their <HI>Trade</HI> extreamly; for Silver, being in Commerce, what blood is in the body, when so much of that is dead, and circulates no more; it is no wonder if such an extravasa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion (if I may use so long and so hard a word) of Silver, occasions a great Deadness in Trade.

<P>I Am now in the last stage of my <HI>Voyage</HI> over <HI>Italy</HI>; for since my last from <HI>Florence,</HI> I have not only got hi|ther, but have been in <HI>Naples</HI>; and have now satis|fied my Curiosity so fully, that I intend to leave this place within a day or two, and go to <HI>Civita vecchia,</HI> and from thence by <HI>Sea</HI> to <HI>Marseilles</HI>; and so avoid an unplea|sant Winters Journey over the <HI>Alps.</HI> It is true; I lose the sight of <HI>Turin, Genoa,</HI> and some other <HI>Courts</HI>: but tho I am told, these deserve well the pains of the Journey; yet when one rises from a great meal, no Delicacies, how much soever they might tempt him at another time, can provoke his appetite: So I confess freely, that the sight of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> have so set my stomach that way, that the Curiosity of seeing new places is now very low with me; and indeed, these that I have of late seen are such, that places which at another time would please me much, would now make but a slight and cold Im|pression.</P>
<P>All the way from <HI>Florence,</HI> through the <HI>Great Dukes</HI> Country, looked so sad, that I concluded, it must be the most dispeopled of all <HI>Italy:</HI> but indeed, I changed my note when I came into the <HI>Popes T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rritories,</HI> at <HI>Pont Centino,</HI> where there was a rich bottom, all unculti|vated, and not so much as stocked with Cattle, But as I passed from <HI>M.

hundred</HI>: now upon an exact survey, it will be found, that where the poor are well looked to, their number rises generally to be the <HI>thirtieth</HI> or <HI>fortieth</HI> part of mankind; and this may be well believed to be the proportion of the <HI>Poor</HI> among the <HI>Christians</HI> of that Age: For as their Cha|rity was vigorous and tender, so we find <HI>Celsus, Iulian, Lucian, Prophiry,</HI> and others, Object this to the <HI>Chri|stians</HI> of that time, that their Charities to the <HI>Poor</HI> drew va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> numbers of the lower sort among them, who made them|selves <HI>Christians</HI> that they might be supplied by their Bre|thren: So that this being the State of the <HI>Christia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> then, we may reckon the <HI>Poor</HI> the thirtieth part, and so fifteen hundred multiplied by thirty, produce five and forty thousand: And I am the more inclined to think, that this rises up near to the full sum of their numbers, by the other Character of the numbers of the <HI>Clergy</HI>; for as there were forty six <HI>Presbyters,</HI> so there were ninety four of the inferior <HI>Orders,</HI> who were two more than double the number of the <HI>Priests</HI>: and this was in a time in which the Care of Souls was more exactly looked af|ter, than it has been in the more corrupted <HI>Ages,</HI> the <HI>Cler|gy</HI> having then really more work on their hands, the instru|cting of their <HI>Catechumens,</HI> the visiting their Sick, and the supporting and comforting the Weak, being Tasks that required so much application, that in so vast a <HI>City,</HI> as <HI>Rome</HI> was in those dayes, in which it is probable the <HI>Chri|stians</HI> were scattered over the <HI>City,</HI> and mixed in all the parts of it we make a conjecture that is not ill grounded, when we reckon, that every <HI>Presbyter</HI> had perhaps about a thousand <HI>Souls</HI> committed to his Care, so this ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es to six and forty thousand: which comes very near the sum that may be gathered from the other hint, taken from the number of their <HI>Poor.</HI> So that about <HI>fifty thousand</HI> is the highest account to which we can reasonably raise the numbers of the <HI>Christians of Rome</HI> in that time: And of so many persons, the Old, the Young, and the Wo|men, make more than three fourth pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts; so that men that were in condition to work, were not above <HI>twelve thou|sand</HI>:
<PB N="151" REF="89">
and by consequence, they were in no condition to undertake and carry on so vast a Work. If <HI>Cornelius</HI> in in that <HI>Letter</HI> speaks of the numbers of the <HI>Christians</HI> in excessive terms, and if <HI>Tertullian</HI> in his Apology hath also set out the numbers of the <HI>Christians</HI> of his time, in a very high strain, that is only to be ascribed to a pom|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous Eloquence, which disposeth people to magnifie their own Party, and we must allow a good deal to a hyperbole, that is very natural to all that set forth their Forces in general terms. It is true, it is not so clear when those vast <HI>Cavities</HI> were dug out of the <HI>Rocks.</HI> We know, that when the <HI>Laws</HI> of the twelve <HI>Tables</HI> were made, <HI>Sepulture</HI> was then in use: and <HI>Rome</HI> being then grown to a vast bigness, no doubt they had <HI>Reposit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ries</HI> for their <HI>Dead</HI>: so that since none of the <HI>Roman Authors</HI> mention any such work, it may not be unreasonable to Imagine, that these Vaults had been wrought and cut out from the first beginnings of the <HI>City</HI>&punc; and so the later Authors had no occasion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o take notice of it. It is also certain, that tho <HI>Burning</HI> came to be in use among the <HI>Romans,</HI> yet they returned back to their first <HI>Custom</HI> of <HI>Burying</HI> Bodies long before <HI>Constantines</HI> time; so that is was not the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> that produced this change. All our modern Writers take it for granted, that the change was made in the times of the <HI>Antonius</HI>: yet there being no Law made concern|ing it, and no mention being made in an Age full of writers, of any orders that were given for Burying-places, <HI>Vel|seru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> opinion seems more probable, that the Custom of Burning wore out by degrees; and since we are sure, that they once <HI>buried,</HI> it is more natural to think, that the <HI>Slaves</HI> and the meaner sort of people were still <HI>Buried,</HI> that being a less expenceful, and a more simple way of bestowing their Bodies, than <HI>Burning,</HI> which was both pompous and chargeable; and, if there were already <HI>Burying places</HI> pre|pared, it is much easier to imagin how the Custom of <HI>Bu|rying</HI> grew universal without any Law made concerning it.</P>
<P>I could not for some time find out upon what grounds the <HI>Modern Criticks</HI> take it for granted, that Burying

began in the times of the <HI>Antonins,</HI> till I had the happi|ness to talk of this ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ter with the learned <HI>Gronovius,</HI> who seems to be such a Master of all the Antient Learning, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> if he had the Authors lying alwayes open before him: he told me, that it was certain, the change from <HI>Burni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g</HI> to <HI>Burying,</HI> was not made by the <HI>Christian Emperours</HI>; for <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">robius</HI> (lib. 7. chap. 7.) sayes, in plain terms, that the Custom of <HI>Burning</HI> the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">odies</HI> of the <HI>Dead,</HI> was quite worn out in that age: which is a clear Intimation, that it was not laid aside so late as by <HI>Constantine</HI>; and as there was no Law made by him on that head, so he and the succeeding <HI>Emper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urs,</HI> gave such an entire toleration to <HI>Paganism,</HI> admitting those of that <HI>Religion</HI> to the greatest Imployments, that it is not to be imagined, that there was any order given against <HI>Burning</HI>; so that it is clear, the <HI>Heath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns</HI> had changed it of their own accord: other|wayes we should have found that among the Complain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s that they made of the Grievances under which they lay from the <HI>Christians.</HI> But it is more difficult to fix the time when this change was made. <HI>Gronovius</HI> shewed me a pas|sage of <HI>Phlegons,</HI> that mentions the Bodies that were laid in the Ground; yet he did not build on that; for it may have relation to the customs of <HI>Burying</HI> that might be elsewhere. And so <HI>Petronius</HI> gives the account of the <HI>Bu|rial</HI> of the <HI>Ephesian Matrons husband</HI>; but he made i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> appa|rent to me, that <HI>Burying</HI> was commonly practised in <HI>Commodus's</HI> time; for <HI>Xiphilinus</HI> tells us, that in <HI>Perti|nax's</HI> time, the Friends of those whom <HI>Commodus</HI> had ordered to be put to Death, had dug up their <HI>Bodies,</HI> some bringing out only some parts of them, and others raising their entire Bodies. The same Author also tells us, that <HI>Pertinax</HI> buried <HI>Commodus's</HI> body, and so saved it from the Rage of the People; and here is a positive Evidence, that <HI>Burying</HI> was the common practice of that time. The same learned person has since my first conversation with him upon this subject, suggested to me two passages of <HI>Festus Pompeius,</HI> that seem to determin&eacute; this whole mat|ter; and that tell us, by what names those <HI>Catacombs</HI>
<PB N="153" REF="90">
were known in the <HI>Roman</HI> time, where-abouts they were&punc; and what sort of persons were laid in them; we have also the designation by which the Bearers were commonly known, and the time when they carried out the Dead Bodies: and it appears particularly by them&punc; that in the <HI>Repositories,</HI> of which that author makes mention, there was no care taken to preserve the bodies that were laid in them from rotting. His words are. <HI>Puticulos antiquissi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">um genus sepulturae appellatos, quod ibi in puteis s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">peli|r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ter homenes: qualis fuerit locus quo nunc cadavera pro|jici solent, extra portam Esquilinam: qua quod ibi putesc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt, inde prius appellatos existimat puticulos Aelius Gal|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, qui ait antiqui moris fuisse, ut patres familias in lo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m publicum extra oppidum mancipia vilia projicerent, at|qu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> it a projecta, quod ibi <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tescerent, nomen esse factum puticuli.</HI> The other passage runs thus. <HI>Vespa &amp; Vespillones dicuntur, qui funerandis corporibus officium gerunt, non <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> minutis illis volucribus, sed quia vespertino tempore cos effe|runt, qui funebri pompa duci propter inopiam nequeunt.</HI> All this agrees so exactly to the thoughts, that a general view of those Repositories give a man, that it will not be hard to persuade him, that those <HI>Burying places,</HI> that are now graced with the pompous title of <HI>Catacombs,</HI> are no other than the <HI>Putecoli</HI> mentioned by <HI>Festus Pompeius,</HI> where the meanest sort of the <HI>Roman slaves</HI> were laid, and so without any further care about them were left to rot.</P>
<P>It is true, it is very probable, that as we see some of the <HI>Roman Families</HI> continued to <HI>Bury</HI> their Dead, even when <HI>Burning</HI> was the more common Custom; so per|haps others continued after this to hurn their dead, the thing being Indifferent, and no Law being made about it; and therefore it was particularly objected to the <HI>Chri|stians</HI> after this time, that they abhorred the Custom of <HI>Burning</HI> the Bodies of the Dead, which is mentioned by <HI>Minutius Felix</HI>; but this or any other evidences, that may be brought from <HI>Medalls</HI> of Consecrations after this time, will only prove, that some were still Burnt, and that the <HI>Christians</HI> practised <HI>Burying</HI> Universally, as
<PB N="154" REF="91">
expressing their belief of the Resurrection; whereas the <HI>Heathens</HI> held the thing Indifferent. It is also clear, from the many genuine <HI>Inscriptions</HI> that have been. found in the <HI>Catacombs,</HI> which bear the dates of the <HI>Consuls,</HI> that these were the common <HI>Burial-Places</HI> of all the <HI>Christians</HI> of the <HI>fourth</HI> and <HI>fifth</HI> Century; for I do not remember, that there is any one da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e that is Antienter; and yet not one of the <HI>Writers</HI> of those <HI>Ages</HI> speak of them, as the Work of the <HI>Primitive Chri|stians.</HI> They speak indeed of the <HI>Burial-Places</HI> of the <HI>Mar|tyrs</HI>; but that will prove no more, but that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he <HI>Christians</HI> might have had their Quarters, and their Walks in those common <HI>Burial-places,</HI> where they laid their <HI>Dead,</HI> and which might have been known among them, tho it is not likely, that they would in times of <HI>Perseoution</HI> make such <HI>Inscriptions</HI> as might have exposed the <HI>Bodies</HI> of their dead Friends to the Rage of their Enemies. And the Spurious Acts of some <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>Martyrs,</HI> are of too little credit to give any support to the common Opinion. <HI>Damasus</HI>'s <HI>Poetry</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of no better Authority. And tho those Ages were inclined enough to give credit to Fables, yet it seems this of those <HI>Catacombs,</HI> having been the work of the <HI>Primitive Christians,</HI> was too gross a thing to have been so early Imposed on the World. And this silence in an <HI>Age,</HI> in which <HI>Superstition</HI> was going on at so great a rate, has much force in it; for so vast a Work, as those <HI>Catacombs</HI> are, must have been well known to all the <HI>Ro|mans.</HI> It were easy to carry this much further, and to shew, that the <HI>Bas Reliefs,</HI> that have been found in some of those <HI>Catacombs,</HI> have nothing of the beauty of the Ancient <HI>Roman</HI> time. This is also more discernable in ma|ny <HI>Inscriptions</HI> that are more <HI>Gothick</HI> than <HI>Roman</HI>; and there are so many <HI>Inscriptions</HI> relating to Fables, that it is plain, these were of later times; and we see by <HI>Saint Ierom,</HI> that the <HI>Monks</HI> began, even in his time, to drive a trade of <HI>Reliques</HI>; so it is no wonder, that to raise the credit of such a heap, as was never to be exhausted, they made some miserable <HI>Sculptures,</HI> and some <HI>In|scriptions</HI>;
<PB N="155" REF="91">
and perhaps shut up the entrys into them with much care and secresy, intending to open them upon some Dream or other Artifice, to give them the more Reputa|tion; which was often practised in order to the drawing much Wealth and great Devotion, even to some single <HI>Relique</HI>; and a few being upon this Secret, either those might have dyed, or by the many Revolutions that hapned in <HI>Rome,</HI> they might have been dispersed before they made the discovery: And thus the knowledge of those pla|ces was lost, and ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to be discovered by accident in the last <HI>Age</HI>; and hath ever since supplied them with an in|exhaustible <HI>Magazin</HI> of <HI>Bones,</HI> which by all appearance are no other than the <HI>Bones</HI> of the <HI>Pagan Romans</HI>; which are now sent over the World to feed a Superstition, that is as blind as it proves expensive.

<P>I have now given you an account of all that appeared most remarkable to me in <HI>Rome.</HI> I shall to this add a very extraordinary piece of <HI>Natural History</HI> that fell out there within these <HI>two years,</HI> which I had first from those two learned Abbots, <HI>Fabretti</HI> and <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">zari,</HI> and that was afterwards more authentically confirmed to me by <HI>Cardi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al Howard,</HI> who was one of the <HI>Congregation</HI> of <HI>Cardi|nals</HI> that examined and judged the matter.

there was no doubt left of that, nor had they given any sort of Scandal in the change of their <HI>Sex</HI>; And if there had been any room left to suspect a Cheat or Disguise, the proceedings would have been both more severe and more secret; and these persons would have been Burnt, or at least put to Death in some terrible manner. Some <HI>Physicians</HI> and <HI>Chirurgions</HI> were appointed to examin the matter, and at last, after a long and exact inquiry, they were judged to be absolved from their <HI>vows,</HI> and were dismissed from the Obligation of a <HI>Religious</HI> Life, and re|quired to go in <HI>mens habit.</HI> One of them was a <HI>Valet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Chambre</HI> to a <HI>Roman Marquess,</HI> when I was there: I heard of this matter only two dayes before I left <HI>Rome,</HI> so that I had not time to inquire after it more particularly; but I judged it so extraordinary, that I thought it was worth communicating to so curious an <HI>Inquirer</HI> into <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P>And since I am upon the subject of the Changes that have been made in <HI>Nature,</HI> I shall add one of another fort, that I examined while I was at <HI>Geneva</HI>: There is a <HI>Minister</HI> of S. <HI>Gervais,</HI> Mr. <HI>Gody,</HI> who hath a <HI>Daughter,</HI> that is now <HI>sixteen Years</HI> old; Her <HI>Nurse</HI> had an extraordi|nary thickness of hearing; at a year old, the <HI>Child</HI> spoke all those little words, that Children begin usually to learn at that age, but she made no progress; yet this was not observed, till it was too late; and as she grew to he two years old, they preceived then that she had lost her hea|ring, and was so deaf, that ever since, tho she hears great noises, yet she hears nothing that one can speak to her.

<P>So far have I entertained you with the short Ramble that I made, which was too short to deserve the name of <HI>Travelling,</HI> and therefore the <HI>Inquiries</HI> or <HI>Observations</HI> that I could make, must be received with the Ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tement that ought to be made for so short a stay; and all will be of a piece, when the <HI>Remarks</HI> are as slight, as the <HI>Abode</HI> I made in the places through which I past was short. As I have avoided the troubling you with things that are com|monly known, so if I have not entertained you with a long recital of ordinary matters; yet I have told you nothing but what I saw and knew to be true, or that I had from such hands, that I have very good reason to believe it: and I fancy, that the things which made the greatest impression on my self, will be acceptably received by you, to whom, as upon many accounts, I owe all the expressions of Esteem and Gratitude that I can ever pay; so I had a

<P>From <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vita Vecchia</HI> I came to <HI>Marseilles,</HI> where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> there were a <HI>Road</HI> as Safe, as the <HI>Harbour</HI> is Covered; and if the <HI>Harbour</HI> were as Large, as it is Convenient, it were certainly one of the most important places in the World: all is so well defended, that it is with respect ei|ther to Storms or Enemies, the securest <HI>Port</HI> that can be seen any where.

There is in that <HI>Port</HI> a perpetual heat, and the <HI>Sun</HI> was as strong in the <HI>Christmas week,</HI> that I was often driven off the <HI>Key.</HI> I made a <HI>Tour</HI> from thence through <HI>Province, L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nguedo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and <HI>Dauphine.</HI> I will offer you no account of <HI>Nismes,</HI> nor of the <HI>Amphitheatre</HI> in it, or the <HI>Pont du Gar</HI> near it; which as they are stupendious things, so they are so copiously described by many, and are so generally known

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iker to fall on those that it pretended to support, and tho crush them, than to give them any considerable assi|stance: When, I say, a <HI>young Prince</HI> came at the <HI>Head</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll this, the very prospect of which would have quite dampt an ordinary Courage, he very quickly changed the <HI>Scene,</HI> he animated the <HI>Publick Councils</HI> with a generous vigour: he found them sinking into a feebleness of hearkning to <HI>Propositions</HI> for a <HI>Peace,</HI> that were as little safe as they were honourable; but he disposed them to resolve on hazarding all, rather than to submit to such Infamous Terms. His cre|dit also among the <HI>Populace</HI> seemed to Inspire them with a new life; they easily persuaded themselves, that as one WILLIAM <HI>Prince of</HI> ORANGE had formed their <HI>State,</HI> so here another of the same name seemed marked out to recover and preferve it. It was this Spirit of <HI>Courage</HI> which he derived from his own <HI>Breast,</HI> and Infused into the whole <HI>People,</HI> as well as into the <HI>Magistracy,</HI> that preserved this <HI>Country.</HI> Something there was in all this that was Divine. The <HI>publick Councils</HI> were again setled, and the people were at quiet, when they saw him vested with a full <HI>Authority</HI> for that time with Relation to <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>War,</HI> and concluded they were safe, because they were in his hands. It soon appeared how faithfully he pursued the <HI>In|terest</HI> of his <HI>Countrey,</HI> and how little he regarded his own. He rejected all <HI>Propositions of Peace</HI> that were hurtful to his <HI>Country,</HI> without so much as considering the Ad|vantages that were offered to himself, (in which you know that I write upon sure grounds.) He refused the offer of the <HI>Soveraignty</HI> of its Chief <HI>City,</HI> that was made to him by a solemn <HI>Deputation,</HI> being satisfied with that <HI>Authority</HI> which had been so long maintained by his <HI>Ancestors</HI> with so much glory, and being justly sensible, how much the breaking in upon established <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Li|berties,</HI> is fatal even to those that seem to get by it.

<P><HI>A Person</HI> of great Rank, that is of <HI>Italian</HI> extraction, and that by consequence knows the <HI>Countrey</HI> well, ha|ving spent much of his time in it, had heard that I was giving the World an account of the <HI>Reflections</HI> that I had made on <HI>the present State of Italy,</HI> and upon that he writ the follow|ing <HI>Paper</HI> to one of his Friends&punc; to be communicated to me; for I have not the honour of any Commerce with himself: The <HI>Observations</HI> that he had made, agreed so exactly with my own, that I thought it would be no small Advantage towards the supporting the Credit of those that I had made, to find them confirmed by so extraordinary a <HI>Person,</HI> whose <HI>Character</HI> (as those who know him well have assured me) is so undispu|ted, that if I durst name him, this alone would serve to esta|blish the belief of the most <HI>critical</HI> parts of my <HI>Letters</HI> in the minds of all that that should read his <HI>Paper</HI>: but since I can|not adventure on this, without obtaining his Leave, and since he is now at such a distance, that it is not easie to get his Friend to write to him, or to receive an Answer from him time enough, therefore I have added this <HI>Memorial.</HI> There are two Particulars in which He and I differ, and in so great a Variety of <HI>Observations,</HI> that are so <HI>Critical,</HI> and so much out of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Common road, it will not appear strange, if there should be some disagreement, when he mentions the <HI>Tax</HI> that the <HI>Po|pe</HI> has laid on the <HI>Corn;</HI> he does not ad one thing which I men|tion, and that is, that the <HI>Measure,</HI> by which the <HI>Pope <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ells,</HI> is by a fifth part less than that by which h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>buys:</HI> The o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her is more considerable; for in the Account that he gives of the pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent <HI>Pope's</HI> breaking in upon the settlement of the <HI>Bank,</HI> tho it is upon the matter very near the same with that which I give, yet there is a differen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of some Importance

<HEAD>REMARKS. Vpon <HI>SWITZERLAND.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is very surprising when one comes out of <HI>France,</HI> (which is an Extraordinary good Country) into <HI>Switzerland,</HI> which is not near so fertil, and yet to see so great a difference between the <HI>People</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e two Countries. The <HI>People</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and especially the <HI>Peasants,</HI> are very poor, and most of them reduced to great Misery and Want. The <HI>People</HI> in <HI>Switzerland</HI> cannot be said to be very Rich; but yet there are very few, even amongst the <HI>Peasants</HI> themselves that are miserably poor; the most part of them have enough to live upon, from their Labour, and the Fruits of the Earth. Every where in <HI>France,</HI> even in the best <HI>Citys,</HI> there are Swarms of <HI>Beggars</HI>; and yet scarce any to be seen throughout all <HI>Switze<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">land.</HI> The Houses of the <HI>Peasants,</HI> or Country people in <HI>France</HI> are extreamly mean, and in them no other Furniture to be found besides poor nasty Beds, straw Chairs, and Plates and dishes of Wood and Earth: In <HI>Switzerland</HI> the <HI>Peasants</HI> have their Houses furnished with good Feather-Beds, good Chairs, and other Housholdstuff for their Convenience, as well as their Necessity; their Windows are all of glass, always kept mended and whole, and their Linnen very neat and white, and as well for their Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ding as their Tables.</P>

<HEAD>Of the <HI>GRISONS</HI> Country.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Grisons</HI> Country is much more Barren than <HI>Swit|zerland</HI>; because 'tis wholy upon the <HI>Mountains,</HI> which produce nothing at all; yet notwithstanding (all Excess and Luxury being banished from amongst them, and the Inhabitants being extreamly Laborious) there are none to be seen there that are very poor and needy,
<PB N="223" REF="125">
but they live at Ease and there are a great many; Gen|try of good Estates. Their <HI>Government</HI> is altogether <HI>Popular</HI>; there are but three or four Royalties belon|ging to Nobility in all the Country. All the rest of their Lands are in Demeane, which may yet well be cal|led Royalties too, because exempt from all dues and pay|ments whatsoever. There is nothing at all to be pay'd for bringing into the Country any sort of Goods or Merchan|dises, or for exporting of them thence; every one there fully enjoys the Fruit of his own Labours, and the Reve|nues of his Land; although the Wine they drink is brought upon Horses four or five days Journey, yet they have it cheaper there than in most parts of <HI>It<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly</HI> or <HI>France,</HI> where it so plentifully grows. There are <HI>Villages</HI> upon the very tops of the <HI>Mountains,</HI> consisting of 150 and 200 Houses apiece; and altho' they have no Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n or Grain that grows there, and but very little Grass, yet the <HI>Peasants</HI> keep three or four hundred Horses, which they imploy to carry Goods and Merchandises, which turns to so good account that they live very well, and want nothing either for the Necessity or Convenience of life. The <HI>Inns</HI> upon the Mountains are very good; and there is always to be had, besides good Bread and Wine, great quantity of Game and Venison, according to the Season of the Year, goo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Trouts, very good Chambers, and Beds after the manner of the Country.

<P>THere are on the other side of the Mountains four <HI>Bailiages,</HI> which were formerly part of the <HI>Dutchy of Milan; Lewis</HI> XII. when he lost that <HI>Dutchy,</HI> gave

The Territory of <HI>Milan</HI> is certain|ly one of the best in all <HI>Italy;</HI> it produceth Wine, Corn and Oyl in abundance, very great quantity of Silk, and (generally speaking) all sorts of Fruits; there is also excel|lent Pasture for Cattle, and yet the <HI>Peasants</HI> there do not live so well by much as in the <HI>Bailiage</HI> of <HI>Lugane</HI>; for there is a great deal of Land that lyes unmanur'd, and the Coun|try is not near so populous as in <HI>Lugane.</HI> There can be no other Reason given for this Difference, but that <HI>Milan</HI> is un|der the Dominion of <HI>Spain</HI>: That the <HI>People</HI> are loaden with Imposts, Subsidies and Taxes, which makes them very poor; whereas the <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Lugane</HI> are under the <HI>Govern|ment</HI> of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> who put no Taxes or subsidies upon them.</P>

<P>I Do not know that in the Kingdom of <HI>France,</HI> as it was thirty years since, there were any <HI>Lakes,</HI> except perhaps in the Mountains of <HI>Dauphin&eacute;.</HI> From the <HI>Lake</HI> of <HI>Iour</HI> to the <HI>Lake</HI> of <HI>Garde,</HI> which is at <HI>Desenesan,</HI> between <HI>Bresse</HI> and <HI>Veronne,</HI> in the Territories of <HI>Venice,</HI> there are a great number of <HI>Lakes</HI>; one of the most considerable is that of <HI>Geneva</HI>; then there is the Lake of <HI>Newchattel,</HI> the Lake <HI>d'Yverdun,</HI> the Lake of <HI>Morat,</HI> the Lake of <HI>Bienne,</HI> the Lake of <HI>Quinti,</HI> the Lake of <HI>Lucerne,</HI> the Lake of <HI>Con|stance,</HI> the Lake of <HI>Valestat,</HI> and many others in the Moun|tains of <HI>Switzerland.</HI> There is on the other side the Moun|tains a great and considerable Lake, called <HI>Come,</HI> also the

The <HI>Duke of Florence</HI> thought there was no way to secure himself of this great <HI>City</HI>; but by depopulating of it, and ruining the Trade, which rendred it so potent, so that at present there is not any Trade there at all.</P>

<P>THere are certainly very few <HI>People</HI> so miserable, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> those who live under the Dominion of the <HI>Pope</HI>: most of the <HI>States of Italy,</HI> and where there are the most Subsi|dies and Impositions, have not put any tax upon <HI>Corn</HI> and <HI>Grain</HI> which make <HI>Bread,</HI> because there is no person, tho never so miserable, that can subsist without it; there is that humanity and regard had to the <HI>People,</HI> in not laying <HI>Taxes</HI> upon <HI>Bread,</HI> because 'tis the common Nourishment and absolutely necessary even for the most Indigent and Poor; tho Impositions are laid without scruple upon <HI>Wine</HI> and o|ther Merchandises, because thy are not so necessary as <HI>Bread</HI> yet the <HI>Pope</HI> makes no scruple to lay very great Imposition<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon <HI>Corn</HI> and <HI>Bread</HI> throughout all his <HI>Dominions,</HI> ex|cept in those places that have yet preserved their Liberties. It was <HI>Donna Olimpia,</HI> that during the Pontificat of <HI>Innocent</HI> the X. began to put Taxes and Imposts upon <HI>Corn,</HI> and made such <HI>Laws</HI> which have ruined the most part of the great Nobility and Gentry, that live under the <HI>Ecclesiastical Go|vernment,</HI> who had their revenues consisting in <HI>Corn.</HI> All the <HI>Popes</HI> who have reigned since <HI>Innocents</HI> time, have found

such a great Advantage to themselves by these Laws of <HI>Donna Olympia,</HI> that they have continued them ever since; and it is at present a very Considerable part of the Ecclesi|astical Revenue. The substance of which said <HI>Law</HI> or Or|dinance is this, <HI>That no person whatsoever is suffered to sell</HI> Corn <HI>to any Strangers; but all those that have any, are obliged to sell it at a price certain to the</HI> Ecclesiastical Chamber; which is not at the most above one moiety o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the real Va|lue; and then the <HI>Ecclesiastical Chamber</HI> sells it again at double the price In <HI>Italy</HI> there is no person, either in City or Country, in the <HI>Popes Dominions,</HI> who is permitted to make their own <HI>Bread,</HI> but eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y one is obliged to buy it of the <HI>Bakers,</HI> who are appointed by the <HI>Chamber</HI>; in each <HI>Vil|lage</HI> and <HI>Burrough</HI> there is but one <HI>Baker</HI> Established by the <HI>Chamber</HI> to make and sell <HI>Bread</HI>; the Baker is obliged to ta|ke the <HI>Corn</HI> of the Chamber at a certain price, and to make the <HI>Bread</HI> of such a quality and weight, and to sell it at a price Certain. In the great Cities, as at <HI>Rome,</HI> there are Very many <HI>Bakers,</HI> who are all obliged to buy a certain quantity of <HI>Corn</HI> of the <HI>Ecclesiastical Chamber</HI> for a whole <HI>Year</HI> to come, which they pay for beforehand, and give ten Crowns the <HI>Salme</HI> or measure, when at the same time the <HI>Chamber</HI> bougt it of the particular persons for five Crowns, at the beginning of the year, all the <HI>Bakers</HI> are obliged to take the same Quantity of <HI>Corn</HI> for the <HI>Year</HI> ensuing, altho sometimes they have a great deal of the last years <HI>Corn</HI> upon their hands, which they must deliver to the <HI>Cham|ber</HI> for five Crowns the <HI>Salme</HI> or measure, and then the very same <HI>Corn</HI> is sold them again for ten <HI>Crowns.</HI> I do not belie|ve that there is any Country in the World, that draws more profit from their Subjects for <HI>Corn,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">an the <HI>Pope</HI> doth in his <HI>Dominions,</HI> which hath been partly the Cause of the ruin of the <HI>Ecclesiastical Estate,</HI> since the Establishment of the said <HI>Law,</HI> which was about thirty years since: the Country is unpeopled, and great part of the Lands lie void and un|cultivated, because it is not worth while to manure them, when the greatest advantage and profit, arising thereby, goes to the <HI>Pope.</HI> In travelling through the Ecclesiastical

<P>EVery body almost knows what 't is which in <HI>Italy,</HI> &amp; especially at <HI>Rome,</HI> they call the <HI>Montes</HI>; it it is much like the Rents upon the Town house at <HI>Paris.</HI> The <HI>Popes</HI> having occasion of <HI>money,</HI> borrow great sums of particular Persons at 4 <HI>per Cent</HI> Interest; This they call at <HI>Rome</HI> the Establishment of the <HI>Monte,</HI> that is, the Creation of cer|tain Officers, and the assignment of several Rents for the payment of those who have lent Mony to the <HI>Pope.</HI> The present <HI>Pope,</HI> finding the <HI>Chamber</HI> engaged to the annual payments of I know not how many Millions of <HI>Roman Crowns</HI> Interest, to those that had ient Money upon the <HI>Monte,</HI> resolved in part to reduce and lessen the great Sum of Money which the <HI>Interest</HI> amounted to, and having for this purpose raised several Millions of <HI>Roman Crowns,</HI> he ac|quainted those that had money upon the <HI>Monte,</HI> that they should come and receive their principal money, unless they would take 3 per cent Interest for the 4 per cent which they formerly received; w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ereupon, there being really no Trade in all the Ecclesiastical Territories, and the Lands worth nothing, and that the Estates of the Nobility were all sold to a penny, all Persons who had Money upon the <HI>Monte,</HI> not knowing how to Imploy it to advantage elsewhere, let it there remain, contenting themselves with three <HI>per cen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> instead of <HI>four per cent,</HI> which they had before; So that by this means every one concerned lost a fourth part of

<P>It is almost incredible the Immence Sums the <HI>Pope</HI> hath raised by retrenching of many superf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uous Expences, and extinguishing several Offices to which great Salleries were payd by the <HI>Ecclesiastical Chamber,</HI> and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> divers other means.

<P>I ought not here to omit relating, that the <HI>Inns,</HI> espe|cially in <HI>Tuscany,</HI> in <HI>Romania,</HI> and between <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Na|ples,</HI> are very sordid and incommodious, one may give a pretty good guess at the prodigious Wealth belonging to the <HI>Clergy</HI> in the <HI>Kingdom of Naples</HI> by the great quantity of plate, Vessels and Statues of Silver in the <HI>Churches</HI>; and by the riches and magnificent Furniture of their Habita|tions, and Vestments of the <HI>Priests.</HI> One may upon the whole matter make this Important Reflection, that if the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Spain</HI> doth not think of some expedient, to hinder the <HI>Clergy</HI> from Increasing their <HI>Estates</HI> in <HI>Lands,</HI> which they do daily, they will in a very little time become Masters of the greatest part of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Naples</HI>; for they are already possessed of more than the half of the <HI>Lands</HI> of that <HI>Kingdom,</HI> besides the other vast profits they make continu|ally under pretence of <HI>Service to the Church,</HI> for their <HI>Mas|ses, Buildings, Burials, Marriages, Confessions,</HI> and by their <HI>Indulgences,</HI> and the <HI>Legacies</HI> left them by Will.</P>
<P>Tho these are Remarks made in hast&punc; yet they may be of use to the Author.</P>
<P>I know several very pleasant Stories of the <HI>Iesuits</HI> at <HI>Naples.</HI> The <HI>Prince of Salerme</HI> gave them the moiety of a great House which he had at <HI>Naples,</HI> and thereupon an Inscription was engaven in Capital Letters upon the Fron|tispice
<PB N="232" REF="130">
of the House, of the Donation thereof given to the <HI>Iesuits</HI> by the said <HI>Prince</HI>; within these few years the <HI>Iesuites</HI> have turn'd the <HI>Heires</HI> of the <HI>Prince of Sal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rme</HI> out of possession of the other Moiety of the said House, and have defaced the Inscription upon the House: and all this they have done by Colour of Law and Justice. Upon the first Establishment of the Society of <HI>Iesuits,</HI> the <HI>Carthu|sians</HI> of <HI>Naples,</HI> who are very rich, voluntarily assigned them a yearly <HI>Pension</HI> of several thousand Ducats; but the <HI>Carthusians</HI> perceiving that of late years several of the <HI>Ie|suits</HI> were grown mighty rich, resolved to withdraw the said <HI>Pension</HI>; the <HI>Iesuites</HI> hereupon went to Law with them, and obtained Sentence, that the said <HI>Pension</HI> should be con|tinued. The <HI>Iesuits</HI> have got a very considerable part of the Lands of the Nobility in the <HI>Kingdom of Naples.</HI> All the <HI>Re|ligious,</HI> of what Order soever they be, who have Houses at <HI>Naples,</HI> have the Priviledge of purchasing all Houses that are contiguous to them on the one side or the other to the very end of the Street, in order to make their Houses entire and to stand alone like an <HI>Island</HI>; and for this purpose they have no more to do, than only pay the Proprietor for his House, not according to the present Value, but as it was last sold, perhaps 50, 60, or 100 years ago, and so hath de|scended from Father to Son successively to the person then in possession.</P>
<P>Many other very considerable Remarks might be made of the divers Triks and Methods the <HI>Clergy</HI> of this <HI>Kingdom</HI> make use of to wheed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e and trapan the <HI>Laity</HI> out of thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Estates.</HI></P>
