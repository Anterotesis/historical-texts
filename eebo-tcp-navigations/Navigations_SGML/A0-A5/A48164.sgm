<HEAD>A LETTER To a FRIEND, Concerning the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAving lately received from you the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company's An&s;wers to the Rea|&s;ons for a Regulated Company, together with their Rea&s;ons why a Joint-Stock will Be&s;t carry on the Trade; and your Commands to give you my Opinion therein, I mo&s;t willing|ly &s;ubmit thereto, in hopes that I may thereby Convince you, and Confute them. I &s;hall take them in order as they lye in their own Paper.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
<P N="1">1&s;t. To the Trade's being more Exten&s;ive in a Regulated Company: They An&s;wer, and &s;ay, <HI>That tho' it be a &s;pecious Argument, yet it is in Fact, directly contrary; for in the</HI> Mu&s;covy, Turkey, Hamborouh, and Ea&s;t-Land <HI>Companies, which are the only Regulated Companies in</HI> England, <HI>there are not &s;o many actual Traders, as there are Per&s;ons Concern|ed in the pre&s;ent</HI> Ea&s;t-India <HI>Joint-Stock;</HI> to which they add, <HI>That in a Regulated Company, the &s;ame is Circum&s;cribed to Experienced Trading Merchants, and no others; whereas in this Trade to</HI> India, <HI>all de|grees of Per&s;ons, of the Nobility, Gentry, Clergy Wi|dows and Orphans, as well as Merchants, are, or may be Concerned in it, although not skilled in Trade.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If by Exten&s;ive, they mean the Sum of Money Em|ployed, a Joint Stock is no more Confined to a parti|cular Sum of Money, than a Regulated Company: But can with great Ea&s;e extend the Trade to the utmo&s;t de|gree, as the Nature thereof is capable.</HI></P>
<P>If the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company mean there are not half &s;o many actual Traders in one of the&s;e four Companies, as there are Per&s;ons Concerned in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Joint Stock, I do grant it them; for none can imagin there is occa&s;ion for &s;o many Traders to <HI>Archangle,</HI> the only Port the <HI>Mu&s;covia</HI> Company Trade to, and requires not above For|ty Thou&s;ond Pounds Stock.</P>
<P>But if they mean in all the Four Companies, then they are gro&s;ly mi&s;taken; there are above two thou&s;and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men actual Traders to tho&s;e Places, within the limits of tho&s;e Companies Charters, be&s;ides Foreigners, which are near as many more. And were tho&s;e Trades Re&s;train'd
<PB N="5" REF="3">to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> only, there would be more than three times the Number of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects Employed in that narrow Compa&s;s of Trade, than there are Concerned in the pre&s;ent Joint <HI>Ea&s;t-Inda</HI> Stock, who&s;e Charter extends to far greater Territories than all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Of the home Trades, experienced Merchants have generally the Advantage, though the&s;e want no In&s;tances of &s;everal Per&s;ons Employing the E|&s;tates of others, that are not Traders, with their own in a joint Intere&s;t. But to Evidence clear|ly to you, that were this Trade &s;etled in a Re|gulated Company, the Nobility, Gentry, Wi|dows, and Orphans, would have greater Oppor|tunities at all times to be concerned, than in a Joint Stock: I offer as an In&s;tance tho&s;e Trading Ships which they call <HI>Interlopers,</HI> in which not above one third of the Per&s;ons Concerned are Merchants, but their Stock is made up by voluntary Sub|&s;criptions, of all degrees of Per&s;ons, who Chu&s;e known Experienced Merchants to Manage it for them, in which every Sub&s;criber hath a Vote; and no body can deny, but tho&s;e who de&s;ire it may have &s;everal opportunities Yearly, of Enga|ging them&s;elves in &s;uch particular Joint Stocks, without excluding all others, who&s;e Circum&s;tan|ces will not at this time &s;uffer them to Trade to <HI>India;</HI> and it is beyond all que&s;tion, That tho&s;e Merchants cho&s;en fairly by every Adventurer, becau&s;e of their Experience and Hone&s;ty, are fit|e&s;t and able&s;t to carry it on, and much better than a Committee Cho&s;en by Art, for &s;ome by purpo&s;es in Joint Stocks, without Regard had to
<PB N="6" REF="4">their Fitne&s;s and Qualifications. And tho&s;e Top|ping Men, who Influence the Choice of the Committees, do, and by their Intere&s;t are bound to Confine their Trade to particular Sums, and will not in any kind extend them to the Ad|vantage of the Nation, beyond their &s;tated Pro|fits and private De&s;igns; witne&s;s the many Di|vidents the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Campany have made, un|til they had nothing left them, on purpo&s;e (to u&s;e their own Words) to put them&s;elves out of the Power of a Parliament; after this, &s;ome of them lent the Stock 50 <HI>per Cent,</HI> at Intere&s;t, and &s;ince that, they made an Addition to their Stock, as they &s;o called it, by a new Sub&s;cription up|on their late Charter; but how much of this New Sub&s;cription-Money was left for them to trade withal, I leave you to judge, when you &s;hall have deducted the 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> abatement, 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> advanced, the Money exhau&s;ted for &s;ecret Service, the lo&s;s of their Stock Sub&s;cribed by their own Members for the Company's Accompt, on purpo&s;e to draw in Hone&s;t and Harmle&s;s Mo|neyed Men, and what they Owed at Intere&s;t here in <HI>India</HI> before all this; by which means they have &s;unk mo&s;t of their Stock, &s;tarved and dwind|led the Trade, nor had any Ships from <HI>China</HI> this long time, and in a manner lo&s;t the Pepper Trade to the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>In their Second An&s;wer they &s;ay, <HI>It mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed, whether it's meant one Buyer in</HI> England, <HI>or</HI> India; <HI>if in</HI> England, <HI>a Joint Stock mu&s;t buy in Common with others. As to Selling, the Goods of a joint Stock are always expos'd by Inch of Candle,
<PB N="7" REF="4">&s;et up at low Rates, where every Per&s;on is admitted to Buy: But if it's meant Buying in</HI> India, <HI>it is clearly the Intere&s;t of</HI> England <HI>it &s;hould be &s;o; for by this means, the Commodities of</HI> England <HI>are Ad|vanced, and tho&s;e of</HI> India <HI>bought at lower Rates, &s;o as not only to &s;upply</HI> England <HI>much cheaper, but al|&s;o the Foreign Markets as Cheap as their Neighbours.</HI> To which I Reply, That if the Company are the only Sellers of <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Goods in <HI>England,</HI> they will, or may, have of us what price they plea&s;e, by bringing home fewer than the Nation would expend, and feeding of it with no more than will yield them their own Rates; as the <HI>Dutch</HI> do with their Spices, which co&s;t them but little more than Pepper, yet they Sell them at this Extravagant Price by publick Sale, to the highe&s;t Bidder; as is the Practice with us by the Candle.</P>
<P>If they are the Buyers of our Engli&s;h Commo|dities; a Joint Stock mu&s;t buy in Common with others; but they have a very great advantage over the Sellers, which I will clear by this in|&s;tance: Suppo&s;ing 30000 long Cloaths are made in <HI>England,</HI> 20000 or more of them are bought up for the <HI>European</HI> Markets, the Remaining mu&s;t either be Sold for <HI>India,</HI> or lie on the Clo|thiers Hands. This latter the Clothiers cannot &s;uffer, and carry on their Trades, and Employ their People, &s;o they mu&s;t Sell to this one Buyer for <HI>India</HI> at his own Rates; but if there were 30 or 40 Buyers, in&s;tead of this &s;ingle one, in a Joint Stock, it is rea&s;onable to believe, the Sel|lers would obtain both better Prices and Pay|ments.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5">
<P>As for a Joynt-Stock's buying of Goods in <HI>India,</HI> upon the &s;ame advantage they do our Goods in <HI>England,</HI> it &s;eems to differ extreamly; becau&s;e in <HI>England,</HI> our Manufactors make their Goods for a general Market, not knowing before-hand to whom, or for what Trade they &s;hall &s;ell them. Whereas in <HI>India</HI> they do not make Goods for an uncertain Market, but the <HI>European</HI> Buyers there do Contract with the <HI>Indian</HI> Merchants for the quantity, quality, and prizes of the Goods they want, and allowed time for their making, and delivery. By which means the <HI>Indians</HI> are not at the mercy of a Joynt-Stock for their Commodities; for if the <HI>Europeans</HI> will not give them their prices, they will not make them the Goods they want.</P>
<P>Indeed, a Joynt-Stock may carry to <HI>India</HI> a few <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Goods, and impo&s;e their own Pri|ces on them, making them too dear for the <HI>Indians;</HI> but if many Per&s;ons carry our Manu|factures thither, they mu&s;t &s;ell them cheaper, to introduce the general u&s;e of them: And tho' the Merchant, by enlarging Exportation and the Importation, &s;hould make the le&s;s profit, yet it's mo&s;t evident the Nation will get the more. Be&s;ides, the Companies Argument will hold as well for all the Trades in <HI>Europe,</HI> as that of <HI>India;</HI> and then we mu&s;t have but one Buyer and one Seller for each Country.</P>
<P>Their Third An&s;wer is, <HI>That the Years</HI> 1654, 1655, 1656. <HI>have given us a Chargeable Experi|ment; that opening the</HI> India <HI>Trade is not the means to regain it from the</HI> Dutch; <HI>for there
<PB N="9" REF="5">were divers Con&s;iderable Merchants that did then break in upon that Joynt Stock by way of Interlo|ping; who having continued that way of Trade for three or four years, found them&s;elves &s;o over|matched by the &V;nited Joynt Stock of the</HI> Dutch, <HI>and impo&s;ed upon by the Natives in</HI> India, <HI>in the point of Buying and Selling, that they them&s;elves, who had formerly broke in as afore&s;aid upon that Company, were the Per&s;ons that fir&s;t applied to</HI> Oliver Cromwell <HI>for Establi&s;hing a Joynt Stock, in order to regain the &s;aid Trade, and were the Per&s;ons that fir&s;t Sub&s;cribed the &s;ame. By which means the Trade was regained to the Nation, when it was nigh lo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And they al&s;o &s;ay, it's &s;o far from obviating the inconveniencies of the</HI> Scotch <HI>Act, that this Nation will not only find by them (as now con&s;ti|tuted in a Joynt Stock) the like Inconveniencies they found from the</HI> Dutch, <HI>but rather greater, by the nearne&s;s of their Neighbourhood. Nor can any Nation cope, as to the</HI> Ea&s;t-India <HI>Trade, with others, unle&s;s E&s;tabli&s;hed in a like Joynt Stock, &s;upported with the like Priviledges and Immunities,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>To this I &s;ay, That the <HI>Dutch</HI> in tho&s;e years of open Trade &s;unk greatly in their Stock and Credit; by rea&s;on we then Imported great quantities of the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Commodities, and under&s;old them, whereby the Trade was enlarged, and the Nation enriched, though the Adventurers made the le&s;s profit.</P>
<P>This indeed might cau&s;e our then Merchants, for their own private intere&s;t, and not for the general good, to imbibe the <HI>Dutch</HI> Notion of
<PB N="10" REF="6">entring into a Joynt Stock (for that Company was then apprehen&s;ive they &s;hould lo&s;e their Trade, if we did continue to keep ours open and free to all) and therefore our Merchants were induced to make their applications to <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> to ex|clude their fellow Subjects from this Trade, be|cau&s;e then they had the pro&s;pect of getting as much by one Hundred Pound Stock, as in open Trade by three Hundred.</P>
<P>And &s;ince the Merchants of <HI>England</HI> could do &s;o much in their Infancy, when they Traded loo&s;e, and had nothing like the Experience and Stock they at pre&s;ent have, what will they not be able now to do, after their Skill, Experi|ence, and Stock is more than trebled, and they Trade in a Regulated Company, which can do all things for the defence and pre&s;er|vation of their Trade, as well as a Company with a Joynt Stock, and improve it abundantly more, with a far le&s;s Charge. For the Com|pany cannot pretend to oppo&s;e the <HI>Dutch</HI> in <HI>In|dia</HI> in time of War, and in Peace it mu&s;t be our Treaties and Strength at home, that mu&s;t &s;ecure us again&s;t any of their In&s;ults abroad. And if the Natives impo&s;e any hard&s;hip upon us, it will not be our wi&s;dom to make War upon them, as the Company ra&s;hly did, but procure the removal of them by means of an Amba&s;&s;ador, by Con&s;uls, and the u&s;ual Pre|&s;ents: For the <HI>Indians</HI> are Men of that Sen&s;e and Morality, that where they meet with ho|ne&s;t and fair Dealing, there is no fear of their di&s;plea&s;ure. And at wor&s;t, our Merchants will
<PB N="11" REF="6">have the &s;ame &s;ecurity in all the <HI>Mogull</HI>'s Ports, as the pre&s;ent Company have at <HI>Suratt,</HI> and in the <HI>Bay,</HI> where they have no Forts, yet drive their Chiefe&s;t Trades, and tru&s;t the Natives with their Mony before hand.</P>
<P>And if all <HI>Engli&s;h-Men</HI> have the freedom of Trade to <HI>India,</HI> it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed any of them will joyn with the <HI>Scotch,</HI> but every one will rather imploy his own Mony, if he be a Mer|chant; and if of any other Condition, intru&s;t it with his own Countrymen, whom he can rea|dily call to an account for what he &s;hall &s;o commit to his tru&s;t.</P>
<P>Now if all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> decline the <HI>Scotch</HI> Company, they will want both Stock and Expe|rience to carry it on, and will &s;ink of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Their Fourth An&s;wer is, <HI>That all Per&s;ons may at any time hereafter come into the Trade; for, notwith&s;tanding upwards of &s;even Hundred New Adventurers came into their Joynt Stock upon their la&s;t Sub&s;cription in</HI> 1693. <HI>yet there hath been each year &s;ince great alterations of other New Adventurers. And it cannot be denied, but the</HI> Scotch <HI>will change its Owners, as People have oc|ca&s;ion to Sell, or Buy.</HI></P>
<P>To this I Reply, That any Man may Buy a Stock, if he will give them their Price, which may be treble the intrin&s;ick value of all the Companie hath, were it &s;old, and divided. But, &s;ay they, every thing is worth what it's bought and &s;old for, which may be &s;o in the opinion of the Buyer; but what lo&s;&s;es have ari&s;en thereby? the Copper, the Salt-Petre, the Linnen, and many other Stocks, are &s;uf|ficient
<PB N="12" REF="7">Te&s;timonies, which have been rai&s;ed by the &s;ame Arts u&s;ed to mount the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Stock upon many occa&s;ions, to the enriching the Great Men of it, and to the ruine of many Families.</P>
<P>But a Man cannot always come into that Joynt Stock, nor any other on the &s;ame Terms with the fir&s;t Sub&s;cribers. For in&s;tance, the pre&s;ent is now Sold at 60 <HI>per Cent.</HI> and up|wards (although according to its intrin&s;ick value it's not worth 20.) Now &s;uppo&s;e the &s;aid Company &s;hould to morrow be E&s;tabli&s;h|ed by Act of Parliament Exclu&s;ive to others, no Per&s;on of what Degree &s;oever, could Buy a Share in their Stock the &s;ame night, under one Hundred Pounds, and perhaps not under one Hundred and Fifty; and yet they would then have no more Riches than they have now.</P>
<P>By this it appears, that what pother &s;oever they make about the Nobility, Gentry, Cler|gy, Widows, and Orphans, none can come into that Trade, if in a Joynt Stock, but upon great di&s;advantages, except tho&s;e that are now actually concerned in it, or &s;hall upon opening the Books Sub&s;cribe to it. Whereas, were the Trade open to all, in a Regulated Company, every Ship being in the nature of a Joynt Stock, all &s;orts of Per&s;ons might at any time, when they can &s;pare Money, or as they come of Age, be Intere&s;ted in it upon the &s;ame Terms with any whatever.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="7">
<P>Having now done with their An&s;wers, I pro|ceed to their Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <HI>It hath been found by common Experience, That all Nations who have had a de&s;ire to procure to them&s;elves a Trade to</HI> India, <HI>have made &V;&s;e of E|&s;tabli&s;hing a Joint Stock, for the gaining thereof, and upon Tryal have found all other means ineffectual, and therefore have continued the &s;ame; and certainly the mo&s;t proper means to pre&s;erve a Trade, is the &s;ame by which it was at fir&s;t acquired: And this was the Rea&s;on why the</HI> Scotch <HI>have cho&s;e this Method, rather then a Regulated Company.</HI> To which I plain|ly An&s;wer, That the main of this Rea&s;on is un|true in fact, and in the Conclu&s;&s;on; for the <HI>Dutch</HI> did not procurre the Trade to them&s;elves by E|&s;tabli&s;hing a Joint Stock; nor did they try any other means to find them ineffectual. But they obtain'd the Trade by a kind of War, the States Encouraging their Merchants by private Com|mi&s;&s;ions, to look into tho&s;e Seas,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Propo&s;al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> for Selling the</HI> Ea&s;t-In|dia <HI>Trade.</HI></NOTE> that they might bring down the Power of <HI>Spain</HI> (which then had that &s;ole Trade) in which they obtained wonderful Succe&s;s, as is at large &s;et down in a Paper Printed the other day, to which I refer you) and partly by War, and partly by Trade, became &s;o great, that they were in a manner another Common-Wealth; after which, they were E&s;tabli&s;hed as they have &s;ince continued: Now &s;hould the <HI>Dutch</HI> have kept on a perpetual War, to have pre&s;erved their Trade, they would mo&s;t certainly have found the contrary Con&s;e|quence, and have lo&s;t it, as our pre&s;ent Company hath done: And this A&s;&s;ertion is equally Ridi|culous,
<PB N="14" REF="8">as to per&s;wade a grown Per&s;on to be held by Leading-&s;trings, becau&s;e he had by tho&s;e fir&s;t learnt to go.</P>
<P>I flatter my &s;elf, that all unbya&s;&s;ed Men will naturally Conclude, that were this Trade a <HI>My&s;tery,</HI> the Ma&s;ters and fir&s;t Di&s;coverers of that My&s;tery, they ought to Enjoy it only but fourteen Years, as the Law hath provided. But that Time once expired, and the <HI>My&s;tery</HI> &s;ufficient|ly made known; u&s;ed and practi&s;ed by many Numbers of their fellow Subjects, who&s;e Right it is become, will any Man in his Sen&s;es de|clare, that the only way to Improve and En|large their Art or Invention, is to appropriate the U&s;e of it to tho&s;e Per&s;ons only for ever, who fir&s;t acquired it.</P>
<P>But the pre&s;ent Company have not been the fir&s;t Di&s;coverers of this Trade, and yet have En|joyed it above Forty Years.</P>
<P>Nor is that A&s;&s;ertion true, That the <HI>Scotch</HI> for that very Rea&s;on cho&s;e a Joint Stock; for they have had no Experience of that Trade, the pra|ctical part is &s;till a My&s;tery to them; and they want E&s;tates to undertake it: The&s;e are mo&s;t probably the Rea&s;ons why the <HI>Scotch</HI> Parliament accepted the Propo&s;als of a Joint Stock; though I am apt to believe that the Projector's chief De&s;ign was the hopes of Gain by Stock|jobbing.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Rea&s;on, <HI>That in ca&s;e of any Difference between the Traders and the</HI> Indians, <HI>the &s;trength a Joint Stock will Maintain in</HI> India, <HI>will enable them better to pre&s;erve their Factories, and oblige the</HI> Indians <HI>to do them Ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<PB N="15" REF="8">
<P N="3">3dly. <HI>That in ca&s;e of any difference or di&s;pute with any</HI> European <HI>Nation in</HI> India, <HI>&s;uch Joint Stocks will be be&s;t able to pre&s;erve their Trade.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4thly. <HI>That it's very well known, the People of</HI> In|dia, <HI>how Moral &s;oever &s;aid to be, yet their Forms of Go|vernment do not admit tho&s;e open Ways to Ju&s;tice, practi&s;ed in</HI> Europe; <HI>wherefore the double Argu|ments of Force and Money to bribe the Government, mu&s;t be always ready, otherwi&s;e upon every little Di|&s;pute, they will over-run and &s;eize the Per&s;ons and Effects, of any Regulated or open Trader, which will always be fomented by the Joint Stocks of other</HI> Eu|ropean <HI>Nations.</HI></P>
<P>To which three together I An&s;wer. Brave and Boldly &s;aid, and had our Company as much Con&s;cience as they have Confidence to a&s;&s;ert a|ny thing makes for them, whether Right or Wrong, they were worthy of a Mark of Di|&s;tinction: Them&s;elves know that the two Ships, the <HI>Seamore</HI> and the <HI>Henry</HI> were admitted to Trade in <HI>India,</HI> and kindly u&s;ed in the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Dominions, although their Factors, by the Com|pany's own po&s;itive Orders, accu&s;ed them as Py|rates, and Pro&s;ecuted them as &s;uch very Indu|&s;triou&s;ly, I may &s;ay, Unnaturally in&s;inuated the Belief thereof into them, becau&s;e they knew there could not be a more provoking Crime for tho&s;e People to puni&s;h, by rea&s;on of their va&s;t Lo&s;&s;es they had &s;u&s;tained from Pyracy; and yet neither their Per&s;ons nor Effects were &s;eized and detain'd, after they were undeceived; but on the contrary, pre&s;erved and well u|&s;ed. And in Ca&s;e of any difference that may
<PB N="16" REF="9">ari&s;e between us and the <HI>Indians,</HI> or <HI>Europe|ans</HI> in <HI>India,</HI> a Regulated Company can by the Prudence and Hone&s;ty of their Factors, Commanders of Ships, and by Pre&s;ents to the <HI>Indian</HI> Governours, by an Emba&s;&s;adour at the <HI>Mogul</HI>'s Court, and Con&s;uls, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> work the &s;ame, nay better effect upon them, than this pre|&s;ent Company; who&s;e Forts and Ca&s;tles are to very little, if any purpo&s;e at all, on &s;uch occa|&s;ions. Our Hone&s;t and Ju&s;t Dealing can only &s;ecure us among&s;t them; and our Wooden Ca&s;tles and Powers at Home can alone Protect us from the Affronts and Injuries of <HI>Europeans</HI> a|broad. So I enter upon their Fifth Rea&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>That in ca&s;e of any con&s;iderable Lo&s;s or want of Profit in the Trade, a Joint Stock mu&s;t &s;till &s;truggle with it; their whole Stock being apporpriated for the Trade: whereas in a Regulated Company, or open Trade, every Man Trades as he plea&s;es, and Di&s;conti|nues when he will; &s;uch will Trade no longer than he finds the &s;ame to an&s;wer his Expectation, but will quit it upon the lea&s;t Di&s;couragement.</HI></P>
<P>To which I reply, This might have &s;ome In|fluence, could they give the World an In&s;tance where a profitable Trade (as we count this to <HI>India,</HI> in which is &s;uch diver&s;ity) hath been de|clined by the People of <HI>England,</HI> who are &s;o far from leaving it upon the lea&s;t Di&s;couragement. That I know no Trade (though it hath been carried on to lo&s;s for many Years &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, but it hath been not only maintained, but con|tinued to be overdone. Witne&s;s formerly the
<PB N="17" REF="9"><HI>Newfound-Land, Mallaga, Virginia,</HI> and at pre&s;ent the <HI>Jamaica, Barbadoes, Leward-I&s;land Trades,</HI> none of the&s;e have been &s;tarved or neglected, notwith|&s;tanding the incredible lo&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments many of tho&s;e Merchants have &s;u&s;tained. We want only &s;cope and liberty to employ our indu&s;try and our Stocks again&s;t the <HI>Dutch,</HI> or any other Competitors. And might this Nation but ob|tain &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing, as to have this Trade open to them all in general, it would &s;oon ap|pear, that as well in this, as in all other Trades, where the <HI>Dutch</HI> have a Company with a Joynt Stock, and we are left free, we &s;hall greatly reduce their Trades, and enlarge ours.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Whereas Joynt-Stocks have at a very va&s;t Expence obtained many great Priviledges and Im|munities from the</HI> Indians, <HI>as Coyning of Money, Trading Cu&s;tom-free, and many others; which, if a Regulated Company, or open Trade be introduced, will be utterly lo&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>This, as all the re&s;t, is but a &s;pecious pre|tence; for whatever that of Coyning of Money may be, by which they can have no advantage, the impre&s;&s;ion they give adding nothing to its value; all the other Priviledges they have,
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vide</HI> The Propo&s;als.</NOTE> were obtained, not by this Company, but by others, and for the benefit of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation; and &s;o run all their <HI>Phirmaunds.</HI> And every private Ship that hitherto Traded in <HI>India,</HI> hath had the advantages thereof.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>It's very well known, that in the Year</HI> 1602. <HI>the</HI> Dutch <HI>&s;eeing the Errors of a lo&s;ing Trade to</HI> In|dia, <HI>did after &s;ome years Experience, reduce the
<PB N="18" REF="10">whole into one &V;nited Joynt Stock, with &s;uch Pri|viledges as they have enjoyed ever &s;ince; which hath carried that Trade to the heighth it now is. And it cannot be denied, but the genius of Trade hath ap|peared there in its utmo&s;t &s;trength. And it is to be feared, unle&s;s the like Methods be pur&s;ued in this Nation, the</HI> Ea&s;t-India <HI>Trade will pa&s;s to &s;ome other Country; Trade always taking its Cour&s;e where it finds the be&s;t treatment, and is allowed the greate&s;t Advantages.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>But admitting a Regulated Trade might &s;truggle with &s;ome difficulties, yet in ca&s;e of any Breach between the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>and</HI> Dutch, <HI>certainly the whole Trade will be lo&s;t, they being very &s;trong in</HI> India <HI>in num|bers of Subjects, and Fortifications, which have not on|ly been got by their being brought to a Joint Stock, but are now maintained, and daily Improving, which a Regulated Company can never with&s;tand.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And it is to be doubted, unle&s;s great Encouragement be given to a Joint Stock, they al&s;o will hardly be able, in &s;uch ca&s;e to continue, and pre&s;erve the Trade to this Nation.</HI></P>
<P>To the&s;e, having in part an&s;wered already, I &s;hall only add, that our <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, with their Joint Stock, have not in time of War been able by force to Re&s;i&s;t the <HI>Dutch</HI> in the <HI>In|dies;</HI> and if you will believe the Letters from their own Chiefs and Con&s;uls from thence,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vide <HI>the &s;ame Pro|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;als.</HI></NOTE> there is no manner of appearance that they ever will; and the <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, who have many Fortifications, never Erected any for &s;uch a purpo&s;e; they know how pernicious War is, to any that are &s;etled in a profitable Trade, in a potent Prince's Country.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="10">
<P>But their Forts are to oppre&s;s the Inhabitants of the Spice and Pepper I&s;lands, and force them to Trade with them&s;elves only, upon their own Terms; which yet turns to &s;mall Accompt, as appears by their Incon&s;iderable Dividents (of 5 and 6. <HI>per Cent. per An.</HI> on the value of their Stock) in regard of their many Rich Ships Year|ly brought home by them of late: Such is their va&s;t Charge of maintaining a Trade by Force, That were the &s;ame &s;et open to all the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> in a Regulated Company; without being clogg'd with that unnece&s;&s;ary Expence; it would &s;oon appear, that when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> gain 30 to 40 <HI>per Cent.</HI> (which is a &s;ufficient Encou|ragement in times of Peace, to extend that Trade to the utmo&s;t) the <HI>Dutch Ea&s;t-India</HI> Com|pany mu&s;t be reduced; for nothing can &s;o much bring down their Elevated Company, and di&s;|courage any other Nation to fall into that Trade, than to Import the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Commodities in great quantities, and &s;ell them Cheaper in our Markets; &s;o that if the whole Sub&s;idie upon <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Goods Exported, were drawn back, as the whole Additional Duty, and half the Sub&s;idie now is; there needs, in my Opinion, no other Encouragement (befides that) to be given to that Trade.</P>
<P>But if the Parliament &s;hall, after all, think fit to E&s;tabli&s;h the Trade to <HI>India</HI> in a Joynt-Stock, it may be hoped they will not E&s;tabli&s;h this pre|&s;ent Company, who have not merited &s;o di|&s;tingui&s;hing a Favour; but take care to pre|&s;erve the Right of the Subject; that all, of what <GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1+ pages"></P>
