<HEAD>TO THE TRVLY HO|NORABLE AND RIGHT WOR|THY KNIGHT SIR THOMAS SMITH <HI>TREASVRER</HI> for the Colonies and Com|panies of VIRGINIA: <HI>and Gouernour of</HI> Mu&s;|couia, Ea&s;t-India, North-we&s;t Pa&s;&s;age, and SOMMER Ilands <HI>Companies.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_HONORABLE SIR, the wi&s;e&s;t of Men, or rather the wi&s;edome of God tells vs,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> 3.1.</NOTE> that <HI>there is a time for all things:</HI> and that the great God, who at his owne will beganne time it &s;elfe, doth at his owne Time beginne all things el&s;e: the fooli&s;hne&s;&s;e of men may aske and mu&s;e why was this &s;o &s;oone, and that &s;o late? but the wi&s;edome of God knowes what is fit for euery time: And &s;urely among&s;t the &s;en|&s;ible &s;ignes, and euident demon&s;trations of Gods all-gouerning prouidence, this is not the lea&s;t, that he brings not forth his migh|tie works altogether, but <HI>makes every thing beautifull in his time.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Eccl.</HI> 3.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> And as in his creation he made not al at once, but produced them in their &s;euerall daies: &s;o in his gubernation, he reueileth not the knowledge of all things in one Age, but di&s;couers them in the &s;euerall ages of the World. And if man aske why God doth thus, holy <HI>David</HI> giues the an&s;were; <HI>The Lord hath &s;o done his mar|vailous works, that they &s;hould be had in remembrance;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 111.4.</NOTE> for were they all in one age (&s;uch is our corruption) they would bee le&s;&s;e ob&s;erued and &s;ooner forgotten, but being declared in their &s;e|uerall times, euery Age finds matter to magnifie God; And therefore He <HI>who&s;e glorious name is to be prai&s;ed for euer,</HI> reueils &s;ome meruailous thing in euery generation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 72.19.</NOTE> that &s;o his name may be prai&s;ed from Generation to Generation.</P>
<P>Mans works are for the mo&s;t part (as Chri&s;t &s;aith of the Wine that is &s;erued in at fea&s;ts) be&s;t at fir&s;t, and afterwards wor&s;e: but with God it is co~trarie; for as in the <HI>Creation,</HI> though euery daies
<PB REF="3">worke was good, yet each daies was better then the former, and the la&s;t be&s;t of all:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gen.</HI> 1.</NOTE> So in his di&s;pen&s;ation and gouernement of the world, all knowledge was not reueiled, nor all good things made knowne at the fir&s;t, but <HI>day vnto day vttereth, and night to night</HI> (and why not al&s;o,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P&s;al.</HI> 19.2.</NOTE> age vnto age) <HI>teacheth knowledge.</HI> And hence is it that as great &s;ecrets in nature, and as admirable perfections in art, and as rare inuentions, and profitable experiments (euery way) are daily di&s;couered in the&s;e latter ages, as were in the for|mer. There be not yet two hundred yeares pa&s;t &s;ince the admi|rable art of Printing was found out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">It began about the yeare 1450</NOTE> an inuention &s;o excellent and &s;o v&s;efull, &s;o much tending to the honour of God, the manife&s;ta|tion of the truth, propagation of the Go&s;pell, re&s;toration of lear|ning, diffu&s;ion of knowledge, and con&s;equently the di&s;couerie and de&s;truction of Poperie, that the Pope and Popi&s;h Politicians wi&s;h it had neuer beene, and haue be&s;towed many a &s;ecret cur&s;e vpon him that fir&s;t reueiled it; and no meruaile, for it ha&s;tens and helps forward his confu&s;ion more then all the Mechanicke my|&s;teries in the World. Nor is yet foure hundred yeares agoe, &s;ince the &s;uperadmirable v&s;e of the Load&s;tone was found out. The at|traction of yron vnto it was &s;eene by <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> and the Ancients, and it amazed them: But the corre&s;pondencie it hath with the Pole-&s;tarre, and con&s;equently the excellent v&s;e of it for Nauiga|tion (being one of the greate&s;t wonders of the world) was not knowne to them; nay (which is more &s;trange) not to the Apo&s;tles them&s;elues; for had it beene, &s;urely Saint <HI>Paul</HI> and his companie had not beene almo&s;t halfe a yeare in his voyage betwixt Iudaea and Italie,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 27.</NOTE> and that through &s;o many difficulties, and at la&s;t &s;hip|wrack; Nor would it haue beene &s;aid, that <HI>when neither Sunne nor Starre appeared for many dayes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ver&s;.</HI> 20.</NOTE> <HI>all hope of being &s;aued was taken away.</HI> For when neither Sunne nor Starre appeares; yet by the helpe of this poore dead Creature, the Pilot can tell where he is, and knowes his cour&s;e, more certainely now in the wide and vn|mea&s;urable Ocean, then they could in the narrow Mediterran Sea; and more ea&s;ily now will an ordinarie Sea-man goe to the We&s;t Indies, then S. <HI>Paul</HI> with all the knowledge God had then reueiled, from Ieru&s;alem to Rome: for how&s;oeuer the Lord was miraculou&s;ly powerfull in the Apo&s;tles, and glorious and won|derfull in the Primitiue Church, in giuing knowledge of tongues,
<PB REF="3">and other learning, and power of miracles, yet he did bound and limit it at his owne plea&s;ure, and re&s;erued this and other of his wonderfull works to be made kno~wne in the later times, that &s;o all men in all ages may know, that <HI>though all things peri&s;h,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>P&s;a.</HI> 102.26</NOTE> <HI>yet God endures;</HI> and though all creatures <HI>waxe old as a garment, yet He is the &s;ame</HI> &s;till and for euer.</P>
<P>It is yet but a hundreth yeares agoe, that (after the world had &s;carce dreamed of any other habitable place of the earth, more then A&s;ia, Africke, and Europe) God di&s;couered to vulgar know|ledge another, and as it were the new world of America, which if it had beene foretold in the elder ages, millions of men would neuer haue beleeued it. And that we in this pre&s;ent and peruer&s;e age may al&s;o knowe, that <HI>Times and Sea&s;ons are in Gods hand,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 1.</NOTE> He hath vouch&s;afed among&s;t the many excellent inuentions and wonderfull di&s;coueries of the&s;e times, to make knowne to vs of the poore <HI>&V;irginian</HI> plantation, and by vs to the world, the hid|den and long concealed truth, touching the &s;tate of the <HI>Barmuda</HI> Ilands. Who did not thinke till within the&s;e foure yeares, but that tho&s;e Ilands had beene rather a habitation of Diuells, then fit for men to dwell in? who did not hate the name when hee was on Land, and &s;hunne the place when he was on the Seas? But behold the mi&s;pri&s;ion and mi&s;conceits of the world! For true and large experience hath now told vs, it is one of the &s;weete&s;t Paradi&s;es that be vpon the earth. Let them hearken to this and make v&s;e of it, that mi&s;like all new inuentions, and &s;u&s;pect all new di&s;coue|ries, and hold it for a rule, That what&s;oeuer is new is nought. If any had &s;aid &s;euen yeares agoe, the <HI>Barmuda</HI> I&s;lands are not only acce&s;&s;ible and habitable, but al&s;o fertile, fruitfull, plentifull, and a &s;afe, &s;ecure, temperate, rich, &s;weet, and healthfull habitation for Man and e&s;pecially for Engli&s;h bodies; oh how loudly would he haue beene laught at, and hi&s;t our of mo&s;t mens companies! And yet no more then He would haue beene who foure hundred yeares agoe &s;hould haue told the world, that by the v&s;e and helpe of a &s;tone a man &s;hould more &s;afely &s;aile vpon the Ocean, round about the earth, then formerly in the narrow Seas: Or then He who two hundred yeares agoe &s;hould haue &s;aid, there was an Art by which all writing of bookes &s;hould bee &s;aued, and that two men &s;hould Print more in a day, then two hundred can write:
<PB REF="4">Or then He who 100.t yeares agoe did tell vs, there was another world, as it were vnder our feete, wherein men liued like vs, and a richer part of the world then ours. And yet all the&s;e are now proued true before our eyes, and all the world can witne&s;&s;e it; and who is he that feeles not the benefit of the&s;e three ble&s;&s;ings? Now therefore let the iealous and &s;u&s;pitious world beare his due reproofe, and let God haue his due glorie and prai&s;e, who brings to light things that lie hidde in darkene&s;&s;e, and reueiles his mer|uailous works in his due time. And let the Planters and Patrons of the <HI>&V;irginia</HI> Colonies take heart and comfort them&s;elues; for that God, who by di&s;couering the&s;e Ilands to them hath deli|uered the world from that old inueterate errour, and giuen them the rightfull po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion (vnder God and his Maie&s;tie) of &s;o rich &s;o whole&s;ome, and healthfull Ilands, which may be as nur&s;eries to <HI>Virginia,</HI> hath hereby let the world &s;ee that he will vphold that Chri&s;tian plantation, if men &s;hould be &s;o ba&s;e and bea&s;tly to for|&s;ake it. But (worthy Sir) if other men were like you, I needed not to make that (If) if all as able as you were as willing, and forward as you, wee &s;hould &s;oone &s;ee a flouri&s;hing Chri&s;tian Church, and Common-wealth in <HI>Virginia;</HI> But let this be your comfort, there is One that is more able, is al&s;o more willing then you, euen the God of heauen and earth: it is his worke you ma|nage, and his cau&s;e you haue in hand; he may worke with com|fort that works with God and for God; he that works with God is &s;ure to preuaile; he that works for God is &s;ure to be rewarded. You know good Sir (and you better then many) that <HI>He is well kept whom God keepes,</HI> and know al&s;o that hee &s;hall bee roially re|warded whom God rewards. And know further for your com|fort, that though the burden lye vpon you and a few more, yet are there many honorable &amp; worthy men of all &s;orts, who will neuer &s;hrinke from you: Goe on therefore with courage and con&s;tan|cie, and be a&s;&s;ured that though by your Honorable Emba&s;&s;ages, and imploiments, and by your charitable &amp; vertuous cour&s;es, you haue gained a worthy reputation in the world, yet nothing that you euer did or &s;uffred more honours you in the eyes of all that are godly-wi&s;e, then your faithfull and vnwearied pro&s;ecution, your continuall and comfortable a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e foraine Plan|tations. A worke &s;o honorable to God, our Religion, our King,
<PB REF="4">and our Countrie; &s;o comfortable to the Soules of the poore Saluages, and &s;o profitable to the Aduenturers (that of <HI>&V;irginia</HI> for our Po&s;terities, but this of the <HI>Barmudas</HI> for the pre&s;ent) as the like (for all the&s;e put together) hath not beene attempted in the Chri&s;tian world the&s;e many Ages. And be cau&s;e it is the glo|rie of God to declare his works: I cannot but commend your wi&s;domes in publi&s;hing tho&s;e &s;trange and welcome newes from the <HI>Barmudas:</HI> the &s;tile is ba&s;e and broken, I confe&s;&s;e, but it bet|ter be&s;eemes the bare and naked truth. Now then let the Chri|&s;tian world reioyce to &s;ee, that God is wor&s;hipped in the Deuills Ilands, and that Engli&s;h men liue &s;afelie and &s;weetly there where neuer any liued before them. It is almo&s;t foure yeares agoe &s;ince our valorous Commanders Sir <HI>Thomas Gates,</HI> and Sir <HI>George Sommers,</HI> with a hundred and fiftie Per&s;ons more, were in a ter|rible tempe&s;t ca&s;t away vpon the&s;e Ilands, and &s;o found it, when they &s;ought it not: and though they &s;uffered &s;hipwrack vpon the Rocks that compa&s;&s;e the&s;e Ilands (as all other did that euer pitcht vpon them) yet were they pre&s;erued euery man; which neuer be|fell any but them&s;elues, &s;uch was the fauour of God vnto them; And there they liued in health and &s;afetie almo&s;t a yeare, when all the world held them dead, and had liued there till this day, and for ought we know, for euer, had they not made them&s;elues two little &s;hips of Cedar, in which they went to <HI>&V;irginia,</HI> yet leauing two men in the Ilands, whom Sir <HI>George Sommers</HI> comming back againe from <HI>Virginia</HI> the &s;ame yeare, and our Colonie &s;ent thither the la&s;t yeare, found in health and good liking: Our Co|lonie, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome three&s;core men, hath now beene there almo&s;t a yeare, from whom we receiue this plaine and &s;imple, but comfortable Narration, and to whom we now &s;end a &s;upply, not of victualls, or &s;uch proui&s;ions, for they neede none &s;uch, but of men and vvomen, for habitation and plantation; which by the ble&s;&s;ing of God now goes away this pre&s;ent moneth, there to plant a Chri&s;tian Church, to endure to the worlds end, where ne|uer man dwelt before, &s;ince the worlds beginning: Oh happie men who there find God &amp; his Angels, where the world thought had beene nothing, but the Deuill and <HI>his Swine into which he en|tered.</HI> The God that led them to it, &s;aued them vpon it,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Math.</HI> 8.31, 32.</NOTE> fed them in it, and &s;ends vs &s;o comfortable newes from it, &s;till ble&s;&s;e it and

<HEAD>A DISCOVERY OF THE BARMV|DAS, NOW CALLED THE SOMMER Ilands.</HEAD>
<P>_I Being in &s;hip called the &s;ea|venture, with <HI>Sir Thomas Gates</HI> our Go|uernour, <HI>Sir George Som|mers,</HI> &amp; Cap|tain <HI>Newport,</HI> three mo&s;t worthy honoured Gen|tlemen, (who&s;e balour and forti|tude the world mu&s;t needes take no|tice of, and that in mo&s;t Honourable
<PB REF="6">de&s;ignes) bound for Virginia, in the height of thirty degrees of northerly Latitude, or there abouts: we were taken with a mo&s;t &s;harpe and cruell &s;torme vpon the fiue and twentieth day of Iuly, <HI>Anno 1609.</HI> which did not onely &s;eparate vs from the re&s;i|due of our fleet, (which were eight in number) but with the violent wor|king of the Seas our &s;hip became &s;o &s;haken, torne, and leaked, that &s;hee receiued &s;o much water as couered two tire of hog&s;heads aboue the bal|la&s;t; that our men &s;tood vp to the middles, with buckets, baritos, and kettles, to baile out the water, and continually pumped for three dayes and three nights together, without any intermi&s;&s;ion; and yet the water &s;eemed rather to encrea&s;e, then to di|mini&s;h: in &s;o much that all our men, being vtterly &s;pent, tyred, and di&s;a|bled for longer labour, were euen re|&s;olued, without any hope of their
<PB REF="6">liues, to &s;hut vp the hatches, and to haue committed them&s;elues to the mercie of the &s;ea, (which is &s;aid to be mercile&s;&s;e) or rather to the mercie of their mightie God and Redeemer, (who&s;e mercies exceed al his works) &s;eeing no helpe, nor hope, in the ap|prehen&s;ion of mans rea&s;on, that any mothers childe could e&s;cape that ine|uitable da~ger, which euery man had propo&s;ed and dige&s;ted to him&s;elfe of pre&s;ent &s;inking. So that &s;ome of the~ hauing &s;ome good and comfortable waters in the &s;hip, fetcht them, and drunke one to the other, taking their la&s;t leaue one of the other, vntill their more ioyfull and happy meeting in a more ble&s;&s;ed world; when it plea&s;ed God out of his mo&s;t gracious and mercifull prouidence &s;o to direct and guide our &s;hip, (being left to the mer|cy of the &s;ea) for her mo&s;t aduantage; that <HI>Sir George Sommers</HI> &s;itting vpon the poope of the &s;hip, (where he &s;ate
<PB REF="7">three dayes and three nights toge|ther, without meales meat, and little or no &s;leepe) couning the &s;hip to keep her as vpright as he could (for other|wi&s;e &s;hee mu&s;t needes in&s;tantly haue foundred) mo&s;t wi&s;hedly and happi|ly de&s;cried land; whereupon he mo&s;t comfortably encouraged the compa|ny to follow their pumping, and by no meanes to cea&s;e bayling out of the water, with their buckets, baricos, and kettles; whereby they were &s;o o|uer-wearied, and their &s;pirits &s;o &s;pent with long fa&s;ting, and continuance of their labour, that for the mo&s;t part they were fallen a&s;leepe in corners, and where&s;oeuer they chanced fir&s;t to fit or lie: but hearing newes of land, wherewith they grew to bee &s;ome|what reuiued, being caried with will and de&s;ire beyond their &s;trength, eue|ry man bu&s;led vp, and gathered his &s;trength and feeble &s;pirits together, to performe as much as their weake
<PB REF="7">force would permitte them: through which weake meanes, it plea&s;ed God to worke &s;o &s;trongely as the water was &s;taid for that little time, (which as wee all much feared, was the la&s;t period of our breathing) and the &s;hip kept from pre&s;ent &s;inking, when it plea&s;ed God to &s;end her within halfe an Engli&s;h mile of that land that <HI>Sir George Sommers</HI> had not long before de&s;cried: which were the Ilands of the Barmudas. And there neither did our &s;hippe &s;incke, but more fortu|nately in &s;o great a mi&s;fortune fell in betweene two rockes, where &s;hee was fa&s;t lodged and locked, for fur|ther budging: whereby wee gained not only &s;ufficient time, with the pre|&s;ent helpe of our Boate, and Skiffe, &s;afelye to &s;et and conuey our men a|&s;hore, (which were one hundred and fifty in number) but after wards had time and lea&s;ure to &s;aue &s;ome good part of our goods and proui&s;ion,
<PB REF="8">which the water had not &s;poyled, with all the tackling of the &s;hip, and much of the yron about her, which were nece&s;&s;aries not a little auaile a|ble for the building and furni&s;hing of a new &s;hippe and pinnace, which we made there, for the tran&s;porting and carrying of vs to Virginia. But our deliuery was not more &s;trange in fal|ling &s;o opportunely and happily vp|on the land, as our feeding &amp; pre&s;er|uation was beyond our hopes, &amp; all mens expectations, mo&s;t admirable. For the Ilands of the Barmudas, as euery man knoweth that hath heard or read of them, were neuer in|habited by any Chri&s;tian or Heathen people, but euer e&s;teemed, and repu|ted, a mo&s;t prodigious and inchanted place, affoording nothing but gu&s;ts, &s;tormes, and foule weather; which made euery Nauigator and Mariner to auoide them, as Scylla and Cha|ribdis; or as they would &s;hun the Di|uell
<PB REF="8">him&s;elfe; and no man was euer heard to make for the place, but as again&s;t their willes, they haue by &s;tormes and dangerou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the rockes, lying &s;euen leagues into the Sea, &s;uffered &s;hipwracke; yet did we finde there the ayre &s;o temperat, and the Country &s;o abundantly fruitfull of all fit nece&s;&s;aries for the &s;u&s;tenta|tion and pre&s;eruation of mans life, that mo&s;t in a manner of all our pro|ui&s;ions of bread, beere, and victuall, being quite &s;poyled, in lying long drowned in &s;alt water; notwith&s;tan|ding, wee were there for the &s;pace of nine moneths (few dayes ouer) not onely well refre&s;hed, comforted, and with good &s;atietie contented, but out of the abundance thereof, pro|uided vs &s;ome rea&s;onable quantitie and proportion of proui&s;ion, to car|ry vs for Virginia, and to maintaine our &s;elues, and that companie wee found there, to the great releefe of
<PB REF="9">them, as it fell out in their &s;o great ex|tremities, and in re&s;pect of the &s;hort|nes of time, vntill it plea&s;ed God, that by my Lord <HI>de la Wars</HI> comming thi|ther, their &s;tore was better &s;upplied. And greater, &amp; better proui&s;ion wee might haue made, if we had had bet|ter meanes for the &s;toring and tran&s;|portation thereof. Wherefore my o|pinion &s;incerely of this Iland is, that whereas it hath beene, and is &s;till accounted, the mo&s;t dangerous, infortunate, and mo&s;t forlorne place of the world, it is in truth the riche&s;t, healthfulle&s;t, and plea&s;ing land, (the quantitie and bigne&s;&s;e thereof con&s;i|dered) and meerely naturall, as euer man &s;et foote vpon: the particular profits and benefits whereof, &s;hall be more e&s;pecially in&s;erted, and hereun|to annexed, which euerie man to his owne priuate knowledge, that was there, can auouch and iu&s;tifie for a truth.

<PB REF="9">day of Iuly <HI>1609.</HI> (after the extre|mity of the &s;torme was &s;omething qualified) wee fell vpon the &s;hore at the Barmudas; where after our Ge|nerall <HI>Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Sommers,</HI> and Captaine <HI>New port,</HI> had by their prouident carefulne&s;&s;e Lan|ded all their men, and &s;o much of the goods and proui&s;ions out of the &s;hip, as was not vtterly &s;poyled, euerie man di&s;po&s;ed and applyed him&s;elfe to &s;earch for, and to &s;eeke out &s;uch re|leefe and &s;u&s;tentation, as the Coun|trie afforded: and <HI>Sir George Sommers,</HI> a man mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to extremities, (and knowing what thereunto belonged) was in this &s;eruice neither idle nor backward, but pre&s;ently by his care|full indu&s;try went, and found out &s;uf|ficient of many kind of fi&s;hes, and &s;o plentifull thereof, that in halfe an houre he tooke &s;o many great fi&s;hes with hookes, as did &s;uffice the whole company one day. And fi&s;h is there
<PB REF="10">&s;o abundant, that if a man &s;teppe in|to the water, they will come round about him; &s;o that men were faine to get out for feare of byting. The&s;e fi|&s;hes are very fat and &s;weete, and of that proportion and bigne&s;&s;e, that three of them will conueniently lade two men: tho&s;e we called rock-fi&s;h. Be&s;ides there are &s;uch abundance of Mullets, that with a &s;eane might be taken at one draught one thou&s;and at the lea&s;t, and infinite &s;tore of pil|chards, with diuers kinds of great fi&s;hes, the names of them vnknowne to me: of crayfi&s;hes very great ones, and &s;o great &s;tore, as that there hath beene taken in one night with ma|king lights, euen &s;ufficient to feed the whole company a day. The Coun|trie affordeth great abundance of Hogges, as that there hath beene ta|ken by <HI>Sir George Sommers,</HI> who was the fir&s;t that hunted for them, to the number of two and thirtie at one
<PB REF="10">time, which he brought to the com|pany in a boate, built by his owne ha~ds. There is Fowle in great num|ber vpon the Ilands, where they breed, that there hath beene taken in two or three houres, a thou&s;and at the lea&s;t; the bird being of the bignes of a good Pidgeon, and layeth egges as big as Hen egges vpon the &s;and, where they come and lay them day|ly, although men &s;it downe among&s;t them; that there hath beene taken vp in one morning by <HI>Sir Thomas Gates</HI> men, one thou&s;and of egges: and <HI>Sir George Sommers</HI> men, comming a lit|tle di&s;tance of time after them, haue &s;tayed there whil&s;t they came and layed their eggs among&s;t them, that they brought away as many more with them; with many young birds very fat and &s;weet. Another Sea fowle there is that lyeth in litle holes in the ground, like vnto a cony-hole; and are in great numbers, exceeding
<PB REF="11">good meate, very fat and &s;weet (tho&s;e we had in the winter) and their eggs are white, and of that bigne&s;&s;e, that they are not to be knowne from Hen egges. The other birds egges are &s;peckled, and of a different colour: there are al&s;o great &s;tore and plenty of Herons, and tho&s;e &s;o familiar and tame, that wee beate them downe from the trees with &s;tones and &s;taues; but &s;uch were young Herons: be&s;ides many white Herons, with|out &s;o much as a blacke or gray fea|ther on them, with other &s;mall birds &s;o tame and gentle, that a man wal|king in the woods with a &s;ticke, and whi&s;tling to them, they wil come and gaze on you, &s;o neare that you may &s;trike and kill many of them with your &s;ticke; and with &s;inging and hollowing you may doe the like. There are al&s;o great &s;tore of Torto|&s;es, (which &s;ome call Turtles) and tho&s;e &s;o great, that I haue &s;eene a
<PB REF="11">bu&s;hel of egges in one of their bellies, which are &s;weeter then any Henne egge: and the Torto&s;e it &s;elfe is all very good meate, and yeeldeth great &s;tore of oyle, which is as &s;weete as a|ny butter; and one of them will &s;uffice fifty men a meale, at the lea&s;t: and of the&s;e hath heene taken great &s;tore, with two boates, at the lea&s;t forty in one day. The Country yeeldeth di|uers fruits, as prickled peares, great aboundance, which continue greene vpon the trees all the yeare; al&s;o great plenty of Mulberries, white and red: and on the &s;ame are great &s;tore of Silke-wormes, which yeeld cods of &s;ilke, both white and yellow, being &s;ome cour&s;e, and &s;ome fine. And there is a tree called a Palmito tree, which hath a very &s;weet berry, vp|on which the hogs doe mo&s;t &s;eede; but our men finding the &s;weetne&s;&s;e of them, did willingly &s;hare with the hogs for them, they being very plea|&s;ant
<PB REF="12">and whole&s;ome, which made them carele&s;&s;e almo&s;t of any bread with their meate; which occa&s;ioned vs to carry in a manner all that &s;tore of flower and meale wee did or could &s;aue, for Virginia. The head of the Palmito tree is verie good meate, ei|ther raw or &s;odden, it yeeldeth a head which weigheth about twen|tie pound, and is farre better meate, then any cabbidge. There are an in|fite number of Cedar trees, (the fai|re&s;t I thinke in the world) and tho&s;e bring forth a verie &s;weete berrie, and whole&s;ome to eate. The Countrey (for as much as I could find my &s;elf, or heare by others) affords no veni|mous creature, or &s;o much as a Rat or Mou&s;e, or any other thing vn|whole&s;ome. There is great &s;tore of Pearle, and &s;ome of them very faire, round, and Orientall; and you &s;hall finde at lea&s;t one hundred &s;eede of Pearle in one Oy&s;ter; there hath
<PB REF="12">beene likewi&s;e found &s;ome good quantitie of Amber Greece, and that of the be&s;t &s;ort. There are al|&s;o great plentie of whales, which I conceaue are verie ea&s;ie to bee killed, for they come &s;o v&s;ually, and ordi|narilie to the &s;hore, that wee heard them oftentimes in the night a bed; and haue &s;eene many of them neare the &s;hoare, in the day time. There was borne vpon the Barmudas, at the time of our being there, two chil|dren, the one a man child, there bap|ti&s;ed by the name of Barmudas: and a woman childe, bapti&s;ed by the name of Barmuda: as al&s;o there was a marriage betweene two Eng|li&s;h people vpon that Iland. This Iland, I meane the maine Iland, with all the broken Ilands adia|cent, are made in the forme of a halfe Moone, but a little more rounder, and diuided into many broken I|lands
<PB REF="13">and there are many good harbours in it, but we could find but one e&s;peciall. place to goe in, or rather to goe out from it, which was not al|together free from &s;ome Danger, where there is three Fathoms wa|ter at the entrance thereof, but with|in, &s;ixe, &s;eauen, or eight Fathoms at the lea&s;t, where you may &s;afely lie Land-locked, from the daunger of all Winds and Weathers, and moore to the Trees. The comming into it is &s;o narrow &amp; &s;traight betweene the Rockes, as that it will with &s;mall &s;tore of Munition bee fortified, and ea&s;ily defended, again&s;t the for|ces of the Potente&s;t King of Europe, &s;uch aduantage the place affoords. There are al&s;o plentie of Hawkes, and verie good Tobacco, as I thinke, which through forgetful|ne&s;&s;e, I had almo&s;t omitted. Now hauing fini&s;hed and rigged our &s;hip, and Pinne&s;&s;e, the one called the De|liuerance,
<PB REF="13">the Pinnace which wee built there, the Patience, wee prepa|red and made our &s;elues readie, to &s;hip for Virginia, hauing powdred &s;ome &s;tore of Hogges fle&s;h for proui&s;i|on thither, and the company thereof, for &s;ome rea&s;onable time: but were compelled to make &s;alt there for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, for all our &s;alt was &s;pent and &s;poiled, before wee recoue|red the &s;hore. We carried with vs al|&s;o a good portion of Tortoi&s;e-oyle, which either for frying or baking did vs very great plea&s;ure, it being very &s;weete, nouri&s;hing, and whole&s;ome: the greate&s;t defects we found there, was tarre and pitch for our &s;hip and pinnace, in &s;tead whereof wee were forced to make lime there of a hard kinde of &s;tone, and v&s;e it: which for the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion and nece&s;&s;itie, with &s;ome war wee found ca&s;t vp by the Sea, from &s;ome &s;hip wracke, &s;er|ued the turne to pay the &s;eames of
<PB REF="14">the pinnace <HI>Sir George Sommers</HI> built, for which hee had neither pitch nor tarre: &s;o that God in the &s;upplying of all our wants, beyond all mea&s;ure, &s;hewed him&s;elfe &s;till mercifull vnto vs, that me might accompli&s;h our in|tended voy age to Virginia, for which I confidently hope, hee doth yet re|&s;erue a ble&s;&s;ing in &s;tore, and to the which I pre&s;ume euery hone&s;t and religious hart will readily giue their Amen. when all thinges were made ready, and commodiou&s;ly fitted, the winde comming faire, wee &s;et &s;aile and put off from the Barmudas, the tenth day of May, in the yeare <HI>1610.</HI> and arriued at <HI>Iames</HI> towne in Vir|ginia, the foure and twentieth day of the &s;ame Moneth: where me found &s;ome three&s;core per&s;ons liuing. And being then &s;ome three weeks or there abouts pa&s;&s;ed, and not hearing of a|ny &s;upply, it was thought fitting by a generall co~&s;ent, to v&s;e the be&s;t means
<PB REF="14">for the pre&s;eruation of all tho&s;e peo|ple that were liuing, being al in num|ber two hundred per&s;ons. And &s;o vp|on the eight of Iune one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and ten, wee imbarked at Iames Towne, not hauing a|boue fourteene dayes virtuall, and &s;o were determined to direct our cour&s;e for New-found-land, there to refre&s;h vs, and &s;upply our &s;elues with victu|all, to bring vs home; but it plea&s;ed God to di&s;po&s;e otherwi&s;e of vs, and to giue vs better meanes. For being all of vs &s;hipped in foure pinnaces, and departed from the towne, al|mo&s;t downe halfe the Riuer, we met my Lord <HI>de la Warre</HI> comming vp with three &s;hips, wet furni&s;hed with victuall, which reuiued all the com|pany, and gaue them great content. And after &s;ome few dayes, my Lord vnder&s;tanding of the great plentie of Hogges and Fi&s;h was at the Bar|mudas, and the nece&s;&s;itie of them in
<PB REF="15">Virginia, was de&s;irous to &s;end thi|ther, to &s;upply him&s;elfe with tho&s;e things, for the better comforting of his men, and the plantation of the Countrey. Whereupon <HI>Sir George Sommers</HI> being a man be&s;t acquainted with the place, and being willing to do &s;eruice vnto his Prince and Coun|trey, without any re&s;pect of his own priuate gaine, and being of three&s;core yeares of age at the lea&s;t, out of his worthy and valiant minde, offered him&s;elfe to vndertake to performe with Gods helpe that dangerous voyage for the Barmudas, for the better releefe and comfort of the peo|ple in Virginia, and for the better plantation of it, which offer my Lord <HI>de la Warre</HI> very willingly and thank|fully accepted: and &s;o vpon the nine|teenth of Iune, <HI>Sir George Sommers</HI> imbarked him&s;elfe at Iames towne in a &s;mall Barge of thirtie tonne, or thereabout, that he built at the Bar|mudas:
<PB REF="15">wherein hee laboured from morning vntill night, as duelie as any workeman doth labour for ma|ges, and built her all with Cedar, with little or no yron worke at all: hauing in her but one boult, which was in the kil&s;on: notwith&s;tanding thankes be to God, &s;hee brought vs in &s;afety to Virginia, and &s;o I tru&s;t he wil protect him, and &s;end him wel back againe, to his harts de&s;ire, and the great com|fort of all the compa|ny there.</P>

<HEAD>AN ADDITION SENT HOME BY THE LAST SHIPS from our Colonie in the <HI>Barmudas</HI></HEAD>
<P>_BEing bound for the Som|mer Ilands, in the &s;hippe called the Plough, wee imbarked the <HI>28.</HI> of Aprill <HI>1612.</HI> So pa&s;&s;ing downe to Graue&s;|end, wee anchored at Tilbery hope vntill the fifth of May. The winde comming faire, wee put foorth and came to the Downes the &s;ixth of May, where we &s;tayed till the ninth. And then &s;etting forward, wee had a faire and comfortable pa&s;&s;age, and by Gods ble&s;&s;ing found &s;o direct a cour&s;e, that on the eleuenth of Iuly
<PB REF="17">in the morning betwixt nine and ten of the clocke wee di&s;cried our hoped and de&s;ired Ilands, and in the after|noone of the &s;ame day about three a clocke we arriued in a very &s;afe har|bour neare S. <HI>Georges</HI> Iland, there we landed all our men and women, and had beene at an anchor abdue an houre before wee could heare of our three men which had been left there. As &s;oone as wee had landed all our company, we went all to prayer, and gaue thankes vnto the Lord for our &s;afe arriuall; and while&s;t we were at prayer, wee &s;aw our three men come rowing downe to vs, the &s;ight of whom did much reioyce vs: &s;o they welcomming vs, and we the like to them againe, we &s;ung a P&s;alme and prai&s;ed the Lord for our &s;afe mee|ting, and went to &s;upper.</P>
<P>The next day being the Sabbath day, which wee dedicated to God in the be&s;t manner we could, wee abode
<PB REF="17">&s;till in the fore&s;aid Iland with all the re&s;t of our company till munday morning, being the thirteenth of Iu|ly: then wee went vp with our &s;hip and company higher into the har|bour, to the place where the&s;e three men had planted them&s;elues. And wheras many Engli&s;h men would haue thought that wee &s;hould haue found the&s;e three men either dead, or more like &s;auage then ciuill, I a&s;&s;ure you al my friends and acquaintance (and &s;o generally to all my country men in England) we found them ci|uill, hone&s;t and religious, and ma|king con&s;cience of their waies: you &s;hall not heare an oath proceed out of their mouths; vaine and idle talke they v&s;ed not: and it &s;eemed appa|rantly vnto our eyes that they haue not beene idly giuen. For how&s;oeuer to be but three of them left in &s;uch a de&s;olate place not inhabited, nor a&s;|&s;ured of any to come to them: would
<PB REF="18">haue made mo&s;t men fainted in any thing they &s;hould haue took in ha~d; yet was it not &s;o with the&s;e me~: nay they &s;hewed vnto vs a good exam|ple, who are now come to them. For they haue planted corne, great &s;tore of wheate, Beanes Tobacco and Mellons, with many other good things for the v&s;e of man: be&s;ides they haue wrought vpon timber, in &s;quaring &amp; &s;awing of Cedar trees, for they intended to build a &s;mall Pinnace to carry them into Virgi|nia, being almo&s;t out of hope and comfort of our comming; becau&s;e Captaine <HI>Dauies</HI> his time was to haue beene with them long before we came. And thus they &s;pent their time in labor, imploying them&s;elues in one good action or other.</P>
<P>Now to certifie you the truth of the &s;tate of the Country, I am loath to write that which I haue &s;eene, by rea&s;on you would condemne my
<PB REF="18">writing (as I feare) and thinke it to be but fal&s;e reports come from vs to draw more company hither, for I perceiue the world is giue~ too much to &s;uch &s;urmi&s;es. But why &s;hould I feare to write that which I know to be true, when as all the &s;hippes company will or may approue it, but cannot reproue it? As fir&s;t the Cap|taine, the Ma&s;ter and his Mate, and all the re&s;t of the Saylers: fir&s;t I will begin with the Fi&s;h and Fowls which the Countrey doth yeeld.</P>
<P>We were no &s;ooner come within a league of the land, but a company of Fi&s;h, as it were, met vs, and neuer left vs til we were come to an ankor within the harbour; and as &s;oone as we had pa&s;&s;ed ouer our bu&s;ines, and all things &s;afe and in order, with a hooke and line wee tooke more then all our whole company was able to eate, &s;o that there was enough to feed many more. The next day after
<PB REF="19">the Sabbath wee went with our net and boat, and if we would haue loaded two boats we might; and &s;o may you doe day by day, Fi&s;hes doe &s;o abound, and they be of the&s;e &s;orts, Mullets, Breames, Hogge-fi&s;h, Rock-fi&s;h and Lob&s;tars, with more &s;orts of other Fi&s;h which I cannot name.</P>
<P>Turkles there bee of a mightie bigne&s;&s;e; one Turkle will &s;erue or &s;uffice three or foure &s;core at a meale, e&s;pecially if it bee a &s;hee Turkle, for &s;he will haue as many egges as will &s;uffice fiftie or three&s;core at a meale; this I can a&s;&s;ure you, they are very good and whole&s;ome meate none of it bad, no not &s;o much as the very guts and maw of it, for they are ex|ceeding fat, and make as good tripes as your bea&s;tes bellies in England. And for Fowle wee went the third day of our arriuall vnto the Bird-Ilands (as we call them) and v&s;ing
<PB REF="19">neither &s;ticke nor &s;tone-bow, nor gunne, wee tooke them vp with our hands &s;o many as we would, that euery one of the company were to haue &s;ome three, &s;ome foure a peece; three for a childe, boy or girle, for a man foure; then reckon what tho&s;e that &s;erued &s;ome foure&s;core people did amount vnto. But this is for certaine, if we would haue brought away twice &s;o many more wee might, but our order is not to take Fi&s;h or Fowle but for one or two meales, becau&s;e that by rea&s;on of the flies, and heate of the countrey, they will not keepe, e&s;pecially the&s;e two monthes, Iune and Iuly, and &s;ome part of Augu&s;t.</P>
<P>Some &s;ixe dayes after our com|ming, we &s;ent out for Hogges, &s;o the company which went out brought home &s;ome: for the meat of them, I hould your mutton of England not of &s;o &s;weet and plea&s;ant a ta&s;te.</P>
<PB REF="20">
<P>Fowles there are of diuers &s;orts, but among&s;t all there is a bird like vnto yours, which you call in Eng|land a Crow, which though they talke in the Barmuda language, yet their tongues &s;hall walke as fa&s;t as any Engli&s;h womans: wee cannot goe vp into the woods, but they will follow after vs with &s;uch an outcry, that it would fret a man to heare them; they are very good meat, fat, and as white fle&s;h as a Chicken, we many times make &s;ome of them leaue their talking with &s;tones or cudgels, for they will &s;it and face you hard at your hand.</P>
<P>And whereas it is reported that this Land of the Barmudas, with the Ilands about it (which are ma|ny, at the lea&s;t an hundred) are in|chanted and kept with euill and wic|ked &s;pirits; it is a mo&s;t idle and fal&s;e report. God grant that wee haue brought no wicked &s;pirits with vs,
<PB REF="20">or that there comes none after vs, for we found none there &s;o ill as our &s;elues, nor the three men neuer &s;aw any euill or hurtfull thing in the Land all the time &s;ince their com|ming, and wee hane found the like &s;ince our landing: no nor any noy|&s;ome thing or hurtfull, more then a poore flie which tarries not aboue two or three moneths.</P>
<P>For the inclination of the weather, con&s;idering in what climate it lies, wee haue had for the &s;pace of &s;ome fortie dayes no raine, but very coole and fre&s;h gales of winde, yet in the day-time very hotte; but wee agree with it very wel, and not a man that hath lien &s;icke or di&s;ea&s;ed, but all likes well, and followes &amp; imployes them&s;elues to one bu&s;ine&s;&s;e or o|ther.</P>
<P>For the fruits which the Land yeelds, they bee the Mulberie, great &s;tore, and Peares which haue in
<PB REF="21">them a red liquor, as the Pomgra|nat hath, or &s;omewhat redder, but very whole&s;ome: if you eat an hun|dred at one time, you &s;hall neuer &s;ur|fet of them; if you eat &s;om proportion of them they will bind, but if you ex|ceed in eating of them, then are they of the contrary operation: yet neuer any that hurt them&s;elues by them, eat they neuer &s;o many. It is cer|taine that one man eat aboue a peck of them in &s;ome ten houres, and was neuer the wor&s;e. We haue a kinde of Berrie vpon the Cedar tree, verie plea&s;ant to eat; and for the Palmito tree, the toppe of it is a great deale &s;weeter and whole&s;omer then any Cabedge.</P>
<P>In &s;ome of our Ilands there growes Pepper, but not &s;o good as our Indian Pepper: diuers &s;orts of other good things there is, which the &s;euerall times of the yeare bring forth one after another; but the top
<PB REF="21">of the Palmito tree is in &s;ea&s;on and good all the yeare.</P>
<P>For the ground, I hold it the ri|che&s;t ground to beare forth fruit, (what&s;oeuer one &s;hall lay into it) that is in the world, and very ea&s;ie and light for digging; &s;o that if a man wil labour, he may turne vp a great quantitie in a day, for it is a fat &s;andy ground, &amp; of colour a brownered.</P>
<P>After the time of our landing ma|ny of the company digged certaine plats of ground, and &s;owed diuers &s;ortes of &s;eedes to make triall of the ground, and for certaine they were &s;eene aboue the ground &s;prung vp the fourth day after their &s;owing: and among&s;t all the re&s;t of the &s;eeds, the Cowcumber and the Mellon were forward: we haue &s;et and &s;ow|ed foure&s;core and one &s;orts of &s;eeds, it was ten dayes before the &s;hippes comming away, and for the mo&s;t part they are all come vp.</P>
<P>Of nece&s;&s;itie I mu&s;t needs mention
<PB REF="22">the Palme-tree once againe, I haue found it &s;o good; take a hat|chet and cut him, or an augar and bore him, and it yeelds a very plea|&s;ant liquour, much like vnto your &s;weete wines; it beares likewi&s;e a berry in bignes of a prune, and in ta&s;te much like.</P>
<P>Al&s;o we haue Oliues grow with vs, but no great &s;tore: many other good excellent things we haue grow with vs, which this &s;hort time will not permit me to write of &s;o largely as I might; but this is of truth, that Hogges, Turkles, Fi&s;h and Fowle doe abound as du&s;t of the earth: for Amber-greece and Pearle wee haue not had lea&s;ure in &s;o few dayes &s;ince our arriuall to goe looke out for the one, or to fi&s;h for the other, but the three men which were left there, haue found of them both. Al&s;o they haue made a great deale of Tobac|co, and if &s;ome would come that
<PB REF="22" MS="y">haue &s;kill in making it, it would bee very commodious both to the Mer|chant, and to the maker of it. And for the Silke-worme, if any were brought ouer, and &s;ome of &s;kill to v&s;e them, there would be very much good done with them, for the verie Spider in the&s;e our Ilands doth weaue perfect fine Silke, both yel|low and white.</P>
<P>The Timber of the Countrey con&s;i&s;teth of three &s;orts, the one is the Cedar, verie fine Timber to worke vpon, of colour redde, and verie &s;weete: the other &s;orts wee haue no name for, for there is none in the company hath &s;eene the like in other Countries, before we came, &s;ome did thinke it to be <HI>Lignum vi|tae,</HI> but it is not &s;o, it is verie fine wood, of colour yellow, and it beares a leafe like vnto a Walnut, and the rine or barke is much like a Malnut tree, and the barke, if one ta&s;te of it, will bite ones tongue, as if
<PB REF="23">it were Ginney Pepper, that wood al&s;o is very &s;weet; the other is much like vnto the &s;econd, but onely it is white; the Palme-tree is no timber, but it growes vp of a great height, and no tree growes like vnto it; for other trees as they grow vp in length, &s;o they grow in bigne&s;&s;e, but the Palme-tree the higher it growes, &s;o the &s;maller it growes: there is another kinde of wood, which &s;ome al&s;o thinke is <HI>Lignum vitae,</HI> and &s;ome of it is come ouer for example.</P>
<P>Other kind of trees there be, but no timber trees they are; but a|mong&s;t all the re&s;t there growes a kinde of tree called. Mangrowes, they grow very &s;trangely, &amp; would make a man wonder to &s;ee the man|nes of their growing, whereof you &s;hall heare at more lea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Al&s;o among&s;t al the fores of Fi&s;h, there is one very &s;trange Fi&s;h, and bew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ifull to behold, wee call it an
<PB REF="23">Angell-fi&s;h (as well it may be) for as you &s;ee the picture of an Angell made, &s;o is this, and it &s;hewes of ma|ny colours both in the water &s;wim|ming, and out of the water, and as daintie a fi&s;h of meat as a Salmon, or rather better.</P>
<P>The plentifull time of our fruits is in your Winter, from October till it be May, or about the latter end of May is the plentifulle&s;t time of our fruits but &s;ome we haue al the yeare of one fruit or other.</P>
<P>The Climate I hold to be verie good, and agreeable with our con|&s;titutions of England, and for the virtuall very whole&s;ome and good: for the three men which were left there are very fat and faire, not tan|ned or burned in the Sun &s;o much as we which came la&s;t, &amp; they &s;ay the~|&s;elues they neuer were &s;icke all the time of their being there, and one of them hath beene there three yeares and vpwards, (one <HI>Chri&s;topher Car|ter</HI>
<PB REF="24">by name, a Buckingham-&s;hire man, borne in wickham or therea|bouts.)</P>
<P>And for &s;uch extraordinarie wea|ther, for thunder and lightning, as it is reported of the&s;e Ilands, I can &s;ee no &s;uch matter, but more tempe|rate and better weather then you haue in England: wee haue gone a hunting, and lien out night by night for Hogges: and if wee had beene wette by weather or by wading, wee may lay vs downe &s;o wette to &s;leepe with a Palme|tree leafe or two vnder vs, and one aboue vs, and we &s;leepe &s;ound|ly without any taking cold or be|ing di&s;turbed with any thing el&s;e: your aires in England are far more &s;ubiect to di&s;ea&s;es then the&s;e I|lands are.</P>
<P>Whales there are great &s;tore at that time of the yeare, when they come in, which time of their comming is in Februarie, and tar|rie
<PB REF="24">till Iune. Likewi&s;e there commeth in two other Fi&s;hes with them, but &s;uch, as the whale had rather bee without their company; one is called a Sword-fi&s;h, the other a Threa&s;her; the Sword-fi&s;h &s;wimmes vnder the whale, and pricketh him vpward; the Threa&s;her keepeth aboue him, and with a mightie great thing like vn|to a flaile, hee &s;o bangeth the Whale, that hee will roare as though it thundered, and doth giue him &s;uch blowes, with his weapon, that you would thinke it to bee a cracke of great &s;hot.</P>
<P>Ha&s;tie occa&s;ion of bu&s;ine&s;&s;e doth make mee write &s;omewhat ha&s;tilie, and leaue out many things which were fitte to bee &s;poken of, wherefore again&s;t my will I am forced to leaue my worke, which I haue begunue, before I come into the midde&s;t of it, but I hope it will &s;uffice you that are my friends to pa&s;&s;e it ouer
<PB REF="25">in the be&s;t manner you can, for there is much broken Engli&s;h of it, &amp; badly pen|ned: regard I pray you the matter, not the manner, the truth of the &s;torie, and not the &s;tile.</P>
<P>But this I &s;ay to them that haue aduentured in Virginia, e&s;pecially to &s;uch as thinke they &s;hall lo&s;e by that worthy action: let them do the like to vs, and I make no doubt but wee &s;hall in &s;hort time giue them &s;ati&s;faction.</P>
<P>For our Inchanted Ilands which is kept, as &s;ome &s;ay, with &s;pirits, will wrong no friend nor foe, but yeeld all men their expectations:</P>
<P><HI>If we can prai&s;e God for &s;o great a ble&s;sing and labour to make benefit of it to his glory, the honour of our Religion, the &s;trength of our Country, and good of our &s;elues. And if you in England will doe what is fit for you, as we will, by Gods helpe, what is fit for vs, we hope &s;hortly to &s;ee the day that men &s;hal &s;ay, Ble&s;&s;ed bee God that &s;uffered Sir <HI>Thomas Gates,</HI> and Sir <HI>George Sommers</HI> to be ca&s;t away vpon the&s;e Ilands.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>A Copie of the Articles which Ma&s;ter R. MORE,</HI> Gouernour Deputie of the <HI>Sommer Ilands,</HI> propounded to the Companie that were there with him to bee &s;ub&s;cribed vnto, which both hee and they &s;ub&s;cribed the &s;e|cond of August, in his hou&s;e, <HI>Anno</HI> 1612. which about the &s;ame time he &s;ent into England to the wor&s;hipfull Companie of the Adventurers.</HEAD>
<P>WE who haue here vnder &s;ub&s;cribed our names, be|ing by the great goodne&s;&s;e of God &s;afely arriued at the <HI>Sommer Ilands,</HI> with purpo&s;e here to inhabit, doe hereby promi&s;e and binde our &s;elues to the performance of the &s;euerall Articles hereafter following, and that in the pre&s;ence of the mo&s;t glorious God, who hath in mercie brought vs hither.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, We doe faithfully promi&s;e, and by the&s;e pre&s;ents &s;olemnely binde our &s;elues euer-more to wor&s;hip that a|fore&s;aid only true and euer-liuing God, who hath made the Heauens, and the Earth, the Sea, and all that therein is, and that according to tho&s;e rules that are pre&s;cribed in his mo&s;t holy Word, and euer to continue in that faith in|to the which we were bapti&s;ed in the Church of England, and to &s;tand in defence of the &s;ame again&s;t all Athei&s;ts, Papi&s;ts, Anabapti&s;ts, Browni&s;ts, and all other Heretiques and Sectaries what&s;oeuer, di&s;&s;enting from the &s;aid Word and Faith.</P>
<PB REF="26">
<P>Secondly, becau&s;e the keeping of the Sabboth-day ho|ly is that wherein a principall part of Gods wor&s;hip doth con&s;i&s;t, and is as it were the Key of all the other parts thereof, wee doe therefore in the pre&s;ence afore&s;aid pro|mi&s;e, That we will &s;et a-part all our owne labours and im|ploiments on that day, vnle&s;&s;e it be tho&s;e that be of meere nece&s;&s;itie, much more vaine and vnfruitfull practi&s;es, and apply our &s;elues to the hearing of Gods word, Prayer, and all other exerci&s;es of Religion in his word required, to the vttermo&s;t of our power.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Seeing the true wor&s;hip of God and a holy Life cannot bee &s;euered, wee doe therefore promi&s;e in the pre&s;ence afore&s;aid, That to the vttermo&s;t of our power we will liue together in doing that which is iu&s;t, both to|wards God and Man, and in particular we will forbeare to take the mo&s;t holy name of God in vaine, in ordinarie &s;wearing by it, or any other thing, or by &s;coffing, or vaine abu&s;ing of his mo&s;t holy Word, or to v&s;e cur&s;ing, or filthy &s;peeches, or any other thing forbidden in Gods mo&s;t holy Word, as al&s;o to liue together without &s;tealing one from another, or quarrelling one with another, or &s;landering one of another: And to auoide all things that &s;tand not with the good e&s;tate of a Chri&s;tian Church and well go|uerned Commonwealth, as al&s;o to embrace the contrarie, as Iu&s;tice, and Peace, Loue, and all other things that &s;tand with the good and comfort of Societie.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Whereas we are here together farre remote from our natiue &s;oile of England, and yet are indeede the naturall Subiects of our mo&s;t royall and gratious King IAMES of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, &amp;c. We doe therefore in the pre|&s;ence afore&s;aid &s;olemnely promi&s;e euer more to continue
<PB REF="26">the loyall Subiects of our &s;aid Soueraigne King, his Heires and Succe&s;&s;ors, and neuer to reuolt from him, or them, vn|to any other what&s;oeuer, but euermore to acknowledge his Supreme Gouernement.</P>
<P>Fiftly, Whereas wee were &s;ent hither by diuers Ad|uenturers of the Citie of London, and other parts of the Realme of England, we doe here in the pre&s;ence afore&s;aid promi&s;e to v&s;e all diligence for the good of the Plantation, and not to purloine or imbe&s;ell any of the prohibited Co~modities out of the generall e&s;tate, but to v&s;e all faith|fulne&s;&s;e as it becommeth Chri&s;tians to doe, as al&s;o to bee obedient to all &s;uch Gouernour or Gouernours, or their Deputie or Deputies, as are, or &s;hall bee by them &s;ent to gouerne vs; As al&s;o to yeeld all reuerence towards the Mini&s;terie or Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pell, &s;ent, or to be &s;ent.</P>
