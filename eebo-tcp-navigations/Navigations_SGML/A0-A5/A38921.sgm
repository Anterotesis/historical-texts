<HEAD>An Exact JOURNAL OF THE Siege of Lymerick, From the <HI>8th</HI> to the <HI>15th</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> 1691.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">From an Officer in the Camp, to his Friend in <HI>London.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON the Ninth, about Two in the Afternoon the Enemy came out, and appeared as if they intended a Sally, but de&s;ign|ed only to &s;ecure a Ditch that lay betwixt them and our Batteries, which was no &s;ooner known, but our Men marcht down upon them, and beat them back into the Town, killing about 30, with the lo&s;s only of one Granadeer: All this day our Guns and Mortars plaid furiou&s;ly on the Town, and &s;o continued all Night without intermi&s;&s;ion; On the <HI>12th,</HI> in the Morning early came over to us one Captain <HI>Dobbins,</HI> who &s;ays, That ye&s;terday in beating the Enemy into the Town we killed two of their Majors, and one of our Bombs killed Mon&s;ieur <HI>La Four,</HI> who was Brother to the Governour, and that the Governour and Officers, to keep up the Hearts of the Town and Gari&s;on, a&s;&s;ure them, that the <HI>French</HI> Fleet have totally beat the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> and forced tho&s;e <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Ve&s;&s;els with Captain <HI>Cole</HI> into the <HI>Shannon,</HI> but that day, or within 48 hours a Squadron of <HI>French</HI> would come into the River to their Relief, and wholly de&s;troy the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>That the Gari&s;on Con&s;i&s;ted of about 15000, of which but 7 or 8000 were well armed, and had no Hor&s;e, nor did any Hor&s;e come there in the Night to Guard. All this day we con|tinued Firing, and about Six and Night the Town appear|ed on Fire, in many places; to prevent its &s;preading, the Enemy blew up Divers Hou&s;es and Buildings, notwith&s;tanding which, &s;ome very Con&s;iderable Place continued burning with great violence un|til Two the next Morning.</P>
<P>The <HI>11th</HI> in the Morning came to the General, &s;ome Officers of <HI>Cunningham</HI>'s Regiment Col. <HI>Echlin,</HI> of the lo&s;s of their Coll. and to pray the General's Favour to have the Regiment: The &s;aid Coll, Sir <HI>Albert Cunningham</HI>'s Regiment being detached from the Camp to join the Forces for the reducing of <HI>Sligo,</HI> and he &s;taying after them, did follow with Ten Men only as a Guard. In their March, upon the Hills near <HI>Boyle,</HI> they unhappily mi&s;took their way in a Fogg, and fell into the Hands of 2 or 300 <HI>Rapparees,</HI> to whom they &s;old their Lives at the utmo&s;t Rate, killing about 25, but were at la&s;t over|pour'd,
<PB REF="2" MS="y">and cut in pieces, who&s;e Blood was &s;oon reveng'd by <HI>Bal|derick O Donnel,</HI> who was in hearing of the Guns, but came too late to &s;ave the Brave Coll. however he kill'd many of them, and Routed the re&s;t: We continued to batter and Bomb the Town all this day and all night.</P>
<P>The <HI>12th,</HI> La&s;t night and this day we continued firing into the Town without Intermi&s;&s;ion. This Morning came to us Ten Dragoons and an Officer, De&s;erters, who &s;ay, That in the great Fire that was in the Town on the Tenth at night, the Bombs &s;et Fire to Three Magazines; one of Powder, which in blowing up, &s;et Fire unto, and burnt great part of the <HI>Engli&s;h Town,</HI> and much o|ther Mi&s;chiefs, the other two of Beef, Bisket, Oates, Brandy and Wine, which was all de&s;troy'd, and would be &s;oon wanted a|mong&s;t them.</P>
<P>The Weather hitherto continues very good; the Breach in the Wall is very wide, and is every moment wider: Our Guns con|tinually firing thereat, which gives us hopes of being Ma&s;ters there|of in a very few days, above half the Town being already ruin'd with our Ball, Bombs, Carca&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Our Men are Impatient to Storm, but when it will be we know not, all things being kept &s;ecret until put in Action.</P>
<P>The <HI>13th.</HI> the General &s;ent an Expre&s;s to the Queen, and we con|tinued all day to Batter the Town.</P>
<P>The <HI>14th</HI> the General &s;ent two Regiments towards <HI>Clonmell</HI> and <HI>Waterford</HI> to reinforce the Militia, there being many Pri&s;oners at the latter, and the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> in tho&s;e parts become In&s;olent. His Excellency hath al&s;o &s;ent Miners and Guards to &s;upport them, with Orders to blow up and demoli&s;h Ca&s;tle <HI>Connell</HI> and the other Ca&s;tles we have taken near <HI>Lymerick</HI> on the <HI>Shannon,</HI> and el&s;ewhere, to prevent their being any more Ne&s;ts of Rebels, Raparees, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>15th</HI> we continued to Bomb and Batter the Town, and made the Breaches &s;o wide that we plainly &s;ee into the Town, which looks ruinous. The Enemy have made much Sod-works, and a very deep Trench or Ditch with Palli&s;adoes and Stockadoes, yet the Men con|tinue impatient to &s;torm, they hoping to have had Orders to have made this night a general A&s;&s;ault, but as yet hear nothing thereof, though &s;ome think the Camp are ready for the work in all points.</P>
<P><HI>Dublin</HI> the <HI>17th.</HI> This night was Publi&s;hed a Proclamation of the Lords Ju&s;tices for a full and free Pardon to all Raparees and others in Arms again&s;t the Government, provided they come in and lay down their Arms in 20 days, otherwi&s;e to be excluded from Mercy, and not only leave given for any Per&s;on to kill them, but a reward of 40 <HI>s.</HI> for each Head brought in, Which &s;hall immediately be paid by the next Ju&s;tice of Peace, and the publick Revenue to reimbur&s;e it, which it's thought will be an effectual way to clear the whole King|dom, and prove more advantageous than droves of Cattel to the Raparee Hunters.</P>
