It fortuned afterward, this &s;ame Lion to be ta|ken and &s;ent al&s;o to Rome, to be there kept among o|ther &s;auadge and wilde bea&s;ts. Not long after this, the &s;ame condemned bondman, was among&s;t others ap|pointed al&s;o to the &s;laughter, &amp; brought into the field called Campus Circulus, to trie his fortune with &s;ome wild bea&s;t, and to conclude, it was his good hap to in|counter with that Lion which hee before had cured: A&s;&s;oone as this hungrie ramping Lion had e&s;pied that man, as one de&s;irous of his praie, he ran towards him to haue deuoured him, but when hee perceiued well that he was the verie man that had lodged with him in his den, and done him good, he &s;traightwaie &s;tood ouer the man, defending him from the crueltie of anie other bea&s;t. When the man who ex&s;pected nothing but death, had well con&s;idered the humanitie of the bea&s;t, and throughlie regarded him, he was then a&s;&s;u|red that it was his quondam ho&s;te in the de&s;erts, and therevpon made the bolder to touch him, and &s;o &s;tro|ked and cheri&s;hed him. The Emperour and the whole &s;tate of Rome &s;tood &s;till, aba&s;hed at this &s;trange &amp; rare &s;ight, and after a little &s;taie made, cau&s;ed to be inquired of the man, whether he were a Nigromancer, or whe|ther he had inchanted the Lion, &s;eeing that he was hunger-prickt, and yet had no power to hurt him: to this he an&s;wered, that his &s;afetie came by the gentle|ne&s;&s;e of the bea&s;t, and not of anie power of his owne, and reported at large the cau&s;e of that clemencie, as be|fore
<PB REF="3"> is expre&s;&s;ed. To be &s;hort, the man had his life, and licence to beg vp and downe the &s;treets of Rome, leading the Lion in his hand, vpon who&s;e brea&s;t was written as followeth.
