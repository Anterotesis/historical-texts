<P>_IT may well bee thought (Right wor|&s;hipfull) as many learned
men are of opinion, that the actions and aduen|tures of the ancients long
&s;ince done &amp; performed, haue beene &s;et forth with more &s;how of wonder
and &s;trangene&s;&s;e then they in truth de&s;erued: the rea&s;on as I think
was, becau&s;e that in tho&s;e daies there were many lear|ned and wi&s;e men,
who in their writings &s;ought by all meanes they could to excell each other,
touching the de&s;cription of Countries &amp; nations: And againe to the
contrarie, for want of good Hi&s;toriographers and writers, many famous actes
and trauels of diuers nations and Countries lie hidden, and in a manner buried
vnder ground, as wholly forgotten and vn|knowne, vnle&s;&s;e it were &s;uch as
the Grecians and Romanes for their owne glories and aduantages thought good to
declare. But to come to the matter of voyages by &s;ea, it is euident to all
the world, what voyage <HI>Ia&s;on</HI> with certaine yong Grecian Princes made
to <HI>Colchos</HI> in the Oriental Countries to winne the golden Fleece, as
al&s;o the trauels by <HI>Hercules</HI> performed into <HI>Libia</HI> in the
We&s;t partes, to winne the <HI>Aurea Mala</HI> or golden apples of
<HI>He&s;perides,</HI> which notwith&s;tanding neither for length, daunger, nor
profite, are any thing comparable to the nauigations and voyages, that of late
within the &s;pace of <PB REF="4"> one hundreth years haue been performed &amp;
made into the Ea&s;t &amp; We&s;t Indies, whereby in a manner there is not one
hauen on the &s;ea coa&s;t, nor any point of land in the whole world, but hath
in time beene &s;ought and founde out. I will not at this pre&s;ent di&s;pute
or make an argument, whether the Countries and na|tions of late yeares found
out and di&s;couered, were knowne to the auncients, but this is most certaine,
that not any &s;trange worke or aduenture was, or euer &s;hall be performed,
but by the &s;peciall grace, fauour and mightie hand of God, and that &s;uch
are worthy perpetual memory, as with noble minds haue &s;ought to effect, and
be the fir&s;t enterpri&s;ers thereof, and with mo&s;t valiant courages and
wi&s;edomes, haue performed &s;uch long &amp; dangerous voyages into the Ea&s;t
and We&s;t Indies, as al&s;o &s;uch Kinges and Princes, as with their Princely
liberalities haue imployed their trea&s;ures, &s;hippes, men and munitions to
the furtherance and performance of &s;o worthy actes, which not|with&s;tanding
in the end turned to their great aduancementes and inriching with great
trea&s;ures, which by tho&s;e meanes they haue drawn, &amp; cau&s;ed in great
aboundance to be brought from thence, in &s;uch manner, that the King of
<HI>Spaine</HI> nowe liuing, (hauing both the Indies in his po&s;&s;e&s;sion,
&amp; reaping the abundant trea&s;ures which yearly are brought out of tho&s;e
coun|tries) hath not only (although couertly) &s;ought all the means he could
to bring all Chri&s;tendome vnder his dominion, but al&s;o (that which no King
or country what&s;oeuer although of grea|ter might then he hath euer done) hee
is not a&s;hamed to v&s;e this po&s;ie, <HI>Nec&s;pe, nec metu.</HI> And
although the fir&s;t foun|ders and di&s;couerers of tho&s;e Countries haue
alwayes &s;ought to hinder and intercept other nations from hauing any part of
their glorie, yet hereby all nations, &amp; indifferent per&s;ons may well know
and perceiue the &s;peciall policie, and valour of the&s;e vnited Prouinces, in
trauelling into both the Indies, in the <PB REF="4"> faces, &amp; to the great
griefe of their many and mighty enemies. Wherby it is to be hoped, that if they
continue in their enter|pri&s;es begun, they will not onely draw the mo&s;t
part of the In|dian trea&s;ures into the&s;e Countries, but thereby
di&s;inherite &amp; &s;poyle the Countrie of <HI>Spayne</HI> of her principall
reuenewes, and trea&s;ures of marchandi&s;es and trafiques, which &s;he
continually v&s;eth and receyueth out of the&s;e countries, and out of
<HI>Spayne</HI> are &s;ent into the Indies, and &s;o put the King of
<HI>Spaine</HI> him&s;elfe in minde of his fooli&s;h deui&s;e which hee v&s;eth
for a po&s;ie tou|ching the new world, which is, <HI>Non &s;ufficit orbis,</HI>
like a &s;e|cond <HI>Alexander magnus,</HI> de&s;iring to rule ouer all the
world, as it is manifestly knowne. And becau&s;e this di&s;cription is fallen
into my handes, wherein is contayned the fir&s;t voyage of the Low-country men
into the Ea&s;t Indies, with the aduen|tures happened vnto them, &s;et downe
and iu&s;tified by &s;uch as were pre&s;ent in the voyage, I thought it good to
put it in print, with many pictures and cardes, whereby the reader may the
ea&s;ilier perceyue and di&s;cerne, the natures, apparels, and fa&s;hi|ons of
tho&s;e Countries and people, as al&s;o the manner of their &s;hippes, together
with the fruitfulne&s;&s;e and great aboundance of the &s;ame, hoping that this
my labour will not onely be accep|table vnto all Marchants and Saylers, which
hereafter meane to traffique into tho&s;e Countries, but al&s;o plea&s;ant and
profita|ble to all &s;uch as are de&s;irous to looke into &s;o newe and
&s;trange things, which neuer heretofore were knowne vnto our nation. And
againe for that all hi&s;tories haue their particular commo|ditie, (&s;pecially
&s;uch as are collected and gathered together) not by common report, from the
fir&s;t, &s;econde, or thirde man, but by &s;uch as haue &s;eene and beene
pre&s;ent in the actions, and that are liuing to iu&s;tifie and verifie the
&s;ame: And although eloquence and words well placed in &s;hewing a hi&s;tory,
are great ornamentes and beautifyinges to the &s;ame, yet &s;uch reports &amp; 
<PB REF="5"> declarations are much more worthy credite, &amp; commendabler for
the benefit of the commonwealth, which are not &s;et down or di&s;ciphered by
&s;ubtill eloquence, but &s;howne and performed by &s;imple plaine men, &s;uch
as by copiou&s;ne&s;&s;e of wordes, or &s;ub|tiltie do not alter or chaunge the
matter from the truth there|of, which at this day is a common and notorious
fault in many Hi&s;toriographers: And thinking with my &s;elfe to whome I were
be&s;t to dedicate the &s;ame, I found it not fitter for any then for the right
wor&s;hipfull Gouernours of this famous Towne of <HI>Middelborgh,</HI> wherein
for the &s;pace of 19. yeares I haue peaceably continued, &s;pecially becau&s;e
your wor&s;hips do not one|ly deale with great &s;tore of &s;hipping, and
matter belonging to nauigation, but are al&s;o well plea&s;ed to heare, and
great fur|therers to aduance both &s;hipping and traffiques, wherein
con|&s;i&s;teth not onely the welfare of all marchants, inhabitants, and
cittizens of this famous City, but al&s;o of all the common wealth of the
vnited Prouinces, hoping your wor&s;hips wil not onely ac|cept this my labour,
but protect &amp; warranti&s;e the &s;ame again&s;t all men: Wherwith I
be&s;eech God to ble&s;&s;e you with wi&s;e|dome, and godly policie, to gouerne
the Common wealth: <HI>Middleborgh</HI> this 19 of October. 1597.</P>

certaine Hollanders to &amp;</HI> from the Ea&s;t INDIES, with their
aduen|tures and &s;ucce&s;&s;e.</HEAD>
<DIV1 TYPE="section">
<P>_THe ancient Hi&s;toriographers and di&s;cribers of the world haue
much commended, and at large with great pray&s;e &s;et downe the diuers and
&s;euerall voyages of many no|ble &amp; valiant Captains (as of <HI>Alex|ander
Magnus, Seleucus, Antiochus, Patrocles, One&s;ecritus</HI>) into the Ea&s;t
<HI>Indies,</HI> which not|with&s;tanding haue not &s;et downe a great part of
tho&s;e coontries, as not being as then di&s;couered, whereby it is thought and
iudged by &s;ome men, that <HI>India</HI> is the full third part of all the
world, becau&s;e of the great Pro|uinces, mighty Citties, famous and I&s;lands
(full of co&s;t|ly marchandi&s;es, and trea&s;ures from thence brought into all
partes of the worlde) that are therein: Where|in the auncient writers were very
curious, and yet not &s;o much as men in our age: They had &s;ome know|ledge
thereof, but altogether vncertaine, but we at this day are fully certified
therein, both touching the coun|tries, townes, &s;treames and hauens, with the
trafiques therein v&s;ed and frequented, whereby all the world, &s;o farre
di&s;tant and &s;eperated from tho&s;e &s;trange nations, are by trade of
marchandi&s;es vnited therevnto, &amp; ther|by commonly knowne vnto them: The
Portingalles fir&s;t began to enterpri&s;e the voyage, who by art of
na|uigation (in our time much more experienced &amp; grea|ter then in times
pa&s;t, and therefore ea&s;ilier performed) <PB REF="6"> di&s;couered tho&s;e
wild Countries of <HI>India,</HI> therein pro|curing great honour to their
King, making his name fa|mous, and bringing a &s;peciall and great profite of
all kindes of &s;pices into their Countrie, which thereby is &s;pread
throughout all the worlde, yet that &s;ufficed not, for that the Engli&s;hmen
(not inferiour to any nation in the world for arte of nauigation) haue
likewi&s;e vnder|taken the Indian voyage, and by their &s;aid voyages into
tho&s;e Countries, made the &s;ame commonly knowne vnto their Country, wherein
Sir <HI>Fraunces Drake,</HI> and M. <HI>Candi&s;h</HI> are chiefly to bee
commended, who not onely &s;ayled into the Ea&s;t <HI>Indies,</HI> but al&s;o
rounde about the world, with mo&s;t pro&s;perous voyages, by which their
voyages, ours haue beene furthered and &s;et forwarde, for that the condition
of the <HI>Indies</HI> is, that the more it is &s;ayled into, the more it is
di&s;couered, by &s;uch as &s;ayle the &s;ame, &s;o &s;trange a Countrey it is:
So that be&s;ides the famous voyages of the Countries afore&s;aid, in the ende
certain people came into <HI>Holland</HI> (a nation wel known) certifying them,
that they might ea&s;ily prepare certaine &s;hippes to &s;ayle into the Ea&s;t
<HI>Indies,</HI> there to traffique &amp; buy &s;pyces, &amp;c. By &s;ayling
&s;traight from <HI>Hollande</HI> and al&s;o from other countries bordering
about it, with de|&s;ire to &s;ee &s;trange and rich wares of other Countries,
&amp; that &s;hould not be brought vnto them by &s;trangers, but by their owne
countrey men, which &s;ome men would e&s;teeme to be impo&s;&s;ible,
con&s;idering the long voyage and the daungers thereof, together with the
vnaccu&s;to|med &s;aylinges and little knowledge thereof by &s;uch as neuer
&s;ayled that way, and rather e&s;teeme it madne&s;&s;e, then any point of
wi&s;edome, and folly rather then good con&s;ideration. But notwith&s;tanding
wee haue &s;eene <PB N="2" REF="6"> foure &s;hips make that voyage, who after
many dangers hauing performed their voyage, returned againe and haue brought
with them tho&s;e wares, that would neuer haue beene thought coulde haue beene
brought into the&s;e countries by any <HI>Holland</HI> &s;hips; but what
&s;houlde I herein mo&s;t commende eyther the willingne&s;&s;e and good
performance of the parties, or the happine&s;&s;e of their voyage? whereof that
I may giue the reader &s;ome knowledge, I will &s;hew what I haue hearde and

We taught them what our Peeces ment, for wee perceyued that they knew them not,
