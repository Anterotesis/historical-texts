<HEAD>To my worthy and honoured
Friend Mr. J. W. Mer|chant
in London.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS this compendious Volume of my
<HI>Northern Memoirs</HI> contains no|thing
of Obscenity whereat I may
Blush, so I hope no Absurdity worthy
your reprehension: Yet because modelized
in the plain Methods of an English
Dress, will perhaps occasion the Sciolist
to interpret me but a Junior Academian;
And truly so he may, if when to consi|der
my slender Education. However, I
have endeavoured, as much as in me
lies, to avoid all Prolixity, and long Pa|rentheses,
which possibly would relish un|pleasant
in your Ear; so have I abhorred
repeated Tautologies, lest fearing to nau|seate
and surfeit your Appetite.</P>
<P>For that end, Sir, I'll be brief in my
Description of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and as concise as
possible, in my <HI>Contemplative Angler;</HI> so
sum up both as compendiously as I can.
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
In <HI>Cambridg,</HI> it's true, I had my Educati|on,
but Travel having the Ascendent over
me, I afterwards rambled the remote
Northern Tracts of <HI>Scotland;</HI> where, to
admiration, I inspected that little Artick
World, and every Angle of it. It's true,
Travel always affected me, and to travel
by Books, when nothing else presented
to transport me, was a solitary kind
of Satisfaction, but no Fruition. I
must confess 'twas in an ill Juncture
of Time, when the Nation was alarm'd
by the fatal approach of an Intestine
War (that perplex'd my anxious Thoughts
with various Inquietudes) because then
to see a preternatural Cloud arise, that
neither Men nor Counsels were prophe|tick
enough to consult, whereby to stop
the Deluge of this hostile Inundation that
threatned to involve the Kingdom in
Blood.</P>
<P>In this Dilemma I left the University
to seek Umbrage in the City of <HI>London;</HI>
but my Retirements contributed equal
trouble, for now a Smoak began to rise in
every Corner, and like a Meteor, it
blaz'd out at last into fuliginous Flames,
that overspread the beautiful Prospect of
Peace; which not only distracted the
Minds but the Manners of Men, because
<PB N="v" REF="4">
then to behold a Storm rise out of a Calm,
that not only threatned Prerogative and
Privilege, but a National <HI>Exit,</HI> unhap|pily
calculated to compel the People to see
their own Ruins wrapt up in the Destiny
of War. Where some, because never e|nough
satisfied by being well, endeavou|red
by inadvertency to make themselves
worse, and striking their Breasts with
their own Weapons, forced all the King|dom
to bleed at last. So that now every
Man runs to seek a Pleget to stanch, if
possible, the reeking Wound; yet no Man
so propitious to find his own Cure, by
which he fancied all the rest incurable.
That now so generally and epidemically
the Kingdom was diseased, that deliriated
and distracted, they let one another Blood.
Nor stop'd it here neither, for the cultiva|ted
Fields stained all over with English
Blood (beyond all precedent) bled, till the
Life of that Non-such <HI>Charles</HI> expired.</P>
<P>But now since <HI>England</HI> is so happily blest
under the prudent Conduct of a valorous
Prince (whose Heroick Vertues like a
<HI>Corona</HI> surround him) presents me an
opportunity to step into <HI>Scotland,</HI> to exa|mine
there her remoter Stars, fed by the vi|tal
Flames of our Southern Orb; supposing
it no Riddle, to fancy any Man ridiculous
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
that holds up a Taper to illuminate the
Sun: for if when to consider, that the
beautiful <HI>Cynthia</HI> sheds her Nocturnal
Beam abroad, only to sprinkle the Universe
with cold Influences, from thence we
conclude that the Major Luminary (<HI>viz.</HI>
the Sun) adds to her Obscurity his bright
Reflections, since she of her self is but a
borrowed Light, that can neither warm
the World, nor cherish it with Vegetati|on.
But the Light of the Sun not only in|vigorates
the Creation with Light and
Warmth, but is also a creational Good in
the Ends of Production.</P>
<P>Come then, whilst it is Day, let us step
into <HI>Scotland,</HI> to rummage and rifle her
Rivers and Rivulets, and examine her
flourishing Streams for entertainment;
there the Rocks and the Groves will be our
solent Reception, and the Cities and Cita|dels
supply us with Accommodation; and
there I fancy our Time will be well e|nough
spent to view the Country, and
give a Description of all her Curiosities:
which I here present you, my worthy Pa|tron,
in this short Narrative, not doubt|ing
your Clemency to absolve my stripling
Muse, though not Fleg enough to elevate
it self to the lowest Elevations of your
generous Acceptation. But I'll do what
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
I can in these Northern Tracts, to bring
you a Discovery of some of her Rarities,
whose solitary Shades strike a Damp to
my Pen, because to behold there such un|expected
Landskips, Meanders and La|byrinths
(which I frequently met with)
as exposed my Resolution to a farther Pro|gress,
whereby to discover all her Northern
Gaities that shin'd so splendidly in every
Fir-wood, as also in her lofty domineering
Hills, that over-top'd the Submissive sha|dy
Dales, and over-look'd the rapid Tor|rents
of Rivers, and pretty purling glid|ing
Rivulets; where the polish'd Rocks,
and imbellish'd Fortifications, beyond be|lief,
so surpriz'd my Genius, that it puz|zles
me to report these remote Curio|sities.</P>
<P>For you are to consider, Sir, that the
whole Tract of <HI>Scotland</HI> is but one single
Series of admirable Delights, notwith|standing
the prejudicate Reports of some
Men that represent it otherwise. For
if Eye-sight be Argument convincing e|nough
to confirm a Truth, it enervates
my Pen to describe <HI>Scotland</HI>'s Curiosities,
which properly ought to fall under a more
elegant Stile to range them in order for a
better Discovery. For <HI>Scotland</HI> is not
<HI>Europe</HI>'s <HI>Vmbra,</HI> as fictitiously imagined by
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
some extravagant Wits: No, it's rather a
legible fair Draught of the beautiful Cre|ation,
drest up with polish'd Rocks,
pleasant Savanas, flourishing Dales, deep
and torpid Lakes, with shady Fir-Woods,
immerg'd with Rivers and gliding Ri|vulets;
where every Fountain o'reflows a
Valley, and every Ford superabounds with
Fish. Where also the swelling Moun|tains
are covered with Sheep, and the
marish Grounds strewed with Cattle;
whilst every Field is fill'd with Corn, and
every Swamp swarms with Fowl. This,
in my Opinion, proclaims a Plenty, and
presents <HI>Scotland,</HI> a Kingdom of Prodi|gies
and Products too, to allure Foreign|ers,
and entertain Travellers.</P>
<P>So that now <HI>Scotland</HI> represents a Star
that reflects a Beam on our Southern Orb;
but <HI>England</HI> is the Magnet that attracts
this Northern <HI>Chalybs</HI> by sweet Influen|ces,
(and mild Condescensions) whereby
the Fruits of Peace and Tranquillity pro|trude,
and bud up to unite Interests in
one another. The Orbs were made for
the Erratick Stars; and every Star as a
lesser Orb (destinated for Light and Dis|covery)
renders the Creation beautiful to
excess, by Divine Appointment of the
Divinest. For the Sun we see is not im|paired,
<PB N="ix" REF="6">
because to lend us a Ray of
Light; nor does it lessen Superiours (in
any Degree) to communicate their Virtues
to influence Inferiours. Do Stars run
retrograde to make Subjects Slaves, when
the whole Creation is but under subjecti|on
by divine Condescension of the great
Creator? Nor is there any thing of Slave|ry
(save only Servility) except Man who
enslaves himself to his Lust; or by Ty|ranny
imposed upon his Fellow-Creature.
And now, Sir, I have done, in doing my
Duty, not only to my Country, but singly
to your Self: give me leave therefore to
wind up my Epistle, and solicit Pardon
if any thing be amiss; supposing my Lan|guage
runs harsh and rugged; but that I
cannot help, because drawn from the rough
Draught of a Martial Pen, which shews
my Stile may be somewhat unpo|lished.
Nor can I flatter the Times, for
I never was a Parasite nor a Time-server;
so that Errors excepted, I may hope a Par|don
and an easy Penance from so mild, so
moderate and judicious a Patron, under
whose Patronage I lodg my Sentiments;
and subscribe my self,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Was somewhat unwilling my <HI>Angler</HI>
should pass the Press, till sedulously
examined by some of your Ingenious
Society; and the rather, because it's emi|nently
known, that many amongst you
are experienced Proficients, in the Mysti|cal
Art and Intrigues of Angling: whose
Approbation will indisputably accommo|date
my Design, provided it come time
enough, before my <HI>Angler</HI> encounter the
Press. However if it come short, I shall sa|tisfy
my self (as if already confirmed) that
you'l please to embarque in these my soli|tary
Examinations of those Rivers and
Rivulets in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> where
the Fields in Winter are paved with
Frost; yet are the Meadows in Summer|time
beautified with Greens, and deck'd
and adorn'd with redolent Sweets, that
perfume the Air, whose delightful Fords
are furnished with Trout; and to advance
Recreation, the generous Race of Salmon:
an entertainment perhaps not every where
<UNCLEAR>understood</UNCLEAR>, nor is it by every Angler (I
<PB N="xi" REF="7">
perswade my self) throughly examined.</P>
<P>But, Gentlemen, I have brought you
somewhat else; which for ought I know
may prove a friendly Diversion, if you
please to inspect this Narrative and Sur|vey
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> where perhaps you'l
meet with such Entertainment, as may
not only benefit, but in some measure de|light
you, after your Exercise of fishing
for Trout. What then if you step from
the Water-side, and contemplate Nature;
so raising your Scenes, you'l admire the
Creator, in his rare and admirable Crea|tional
Work; there you may see the Ope|ration
of Elements and stellate Influences;
there also you may see the curious and va|rious
Amalgamations of Earth into Crista|line
Forms, and Opacous Bodies; and
there you may see how the Luminaries
are adapted Parents of polite Stones, Me|tals
and Minerals: How Vegetables also
protrude and bud up, because impregna|ted
with prolifick Vegetation; and how
the Principles naturally operate in Ani|mals,
inspired and animated by the Soul
of the World.</P>
<P>We have also considered some Moral
Duties, in reference to Men of sober Con|versation:
Nor are we altogether barren
of Solitudes, and Divine Contemplation.
<PB N="xii" REF="8">
The Stars we consider as fiery Objects, and
he that made them thus gloriously to shine,
made them also to influence and impreg|nate
the Universe: for God through Wis|dom
hung up aloft these bright, shining
and globical Bodies, whereby to illumi|nate
this stupendous Creation; and that
by reason of their Rapidity and circular
Rotation, they impregnate the Earth with
prolifick Virtue: and as we see the Stars
surround the Earth, the Orbs beyond dis|pute
immure the Stars; but the Heavens
encircling both the Orbs and Elements,
plainly demonstrate that from the Di|vinest,
every created Individual has both
Ends and Means naturally and specifi|cally
appropriated to it self, whereby to
make it visible; and Visibility terminates
in Time. Which Notion to explain in a
philosophical Sense, seems to imply, that
both Matter and Form results in their own
proper and natural beginning. Know
therefore that Corruption is the Child of
Putrefaction, and Putrefaction is the Prison
and Sepulchre of Death; Death therefore
precedes the Resurrection, and the Resur|rection
is the <HI>Clavis</HI> that opens Eternity.</P>
<P>But, Gentlemen, pray excuse me if I
wander too far from the Water-side, to
gaze and admire these glorious Metaphors,
<PB N="xiii" REF="8">
the Divine Oracles of him that made them,
so not only lose my Opportunity of
Angling, but endanger to lose my self
in these solitary Meanders; rarely fre|quented
and trod by the Vulgar. Give
me leave therefore to retrieve my self, and
introduct you into the slender Margin
of this my uncultivated Book; and exa|mine
the Volume, if provided any thing
may be found there worthy your ingeni|ous
Entertainment, or the general accep|tation
of so splendid a Society, that gives
Laws and Rules to all the Anglers in <HI>Eng|land;</HI>
that accommodates every County
with Rods for Diversion, and inriches
every River with Hooks and Lines, that
circumspectly prescribes Critical Hours
for Recreation, and consults both the
Mean and Elevation of Angling, where|by
to augment and quicken the Spur of
Pleasure. But I'm sorry I can raise my
Scenes no higher, to elevate this admira|ble
Piscatorian Science, beyond the <HI>Elizium</HI>
of the Angler's <HI>Arcadia.</HI> For had I that
preeminence of Pen and Fancy, to illu|strate
what the Art of it self deservedly
requires, I should impoverish <HI>England,</HI>
nay it may be all <HI>Europe,</HI> if not all the
World, to select Expressions, to express
and decipher it's deserved Encomium.
<PB N="xiv" REF="9">
But finding my self unable to accomplish
this great Undertaking, I'll silently sit
down satisfied, under the Rhapsodies of
Contemplation; inviting my Associates
so to do, when encountring the Rocks and
Rivers for Recreation.</P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, since Magnetism is
so little known among Artists, I less
blame the indigency of those that know
not how Nature by innare Quality attracts
her own Likeness, than other inconside|rate
Rationals, that sport away their time
in pursuit of their Lusts. Let the Ang|ler
therefore (if he please) select Con|templation,
and pity such others that are
destitute of those heavenly Advantages,
till the Strokes of Grace and a pious Ex|ample
or Education, compel them to
write <HI>Memorandums</HI> of the glorious Cre|ation,
in the fair and legible Copy-Book
of Wisdom; so imitate Nature in her
daily Progress, till ariving at the Super-excellency
of practical Christianity, which
truly to know, is Wisdom in the Ab|stract,
that transmutes our Nature into
Grace, and our Humanity into Divinity.
But this you'l alledg is heavenly Trans|mutation;
and so it is beyond the Medi|ums
and Discovery of Art, or the Indi|cation
of Nature (improper therefore to
<PB N="xv" REF="9">
introduce Undergraduats): It's true, it is
so; but what then? can't they omit the
thoughts of Elements, to mingle some|times
their Contemplations with things
more sublime? Can't they relinquish their
Exercise, to converse with heavenly Ob|jects?
This I advise to, and my Book will
instruct them.</P>
<P>Now I have given you a Plat-form for
Contemplation, which opens the Windows
of the Mind to inspectulate (if possible)
invisible Objects; but not to darken your
sight by gazing too much at the Sun; for
the more amiable and illustrious any thing
is, the more astonishing is that thing, and
ought therefore to be the more admired,
consequently desired, before the Methods
of Industry, or the lineal Progress of Art.
But in as much as Angling is a great part
of our Business, let me admonish the more
Ingenious Artist to be mindful of Experi|ence,
lest peradventure he slide into the
slippery Tract of an Author, so unman him|self
of practical Demonstration. Against
which Hypothesis I exhort the Angler,
whilst capable to trace the silver Sands, or
florid Meadows of <HI>Thames</HI> and <HI>Trent,</HI> to
consort with Ingenuity amongst Rocks and
Meanders, where probably he may meet
with his Friend,</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Present you with a fair Opportunity to tra|vel
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and stay at Home: but then
you'l lose the benefit of tracing those Nor|thern
Tracts, where you may pick up admira|ble
Curiosities in every Angle, because natural|ly
replenished with great Variety. But not that
I commend the Country to flatter her Inhabi|tants,
nor intend I to exceed in my Method and
Stile, when only to describe her Cities and Ci|tadels,
Towns and Castles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For that End
expect an impartial Account from a Candid and
(I would, if permitted, say) a Regular Pen,
that neither profits nor loses by imbellishing or
demolishing either her Towns, Cities, Forts
or Fortifications.</P>
<P>But the longer I comment upon this Northern
Subject, the more Arguments I bring to con|vince
the Incredulous, that <HI>Scotland</HI>'s national
Stores, and commodious maritime Ports, will
treat you with good Accommodation and civil
Entertainment. Nor do I seem to contradict
my self, when modestly concluding every im|partial
Examinant under the Perswasion of my
Opinion: nor doubt I to convince him, that
shall hereafter trace her delightful Shores, and
observe the various and distinct Classes of her
<PB N="xvii" REF="10">
numberless Numbers of Fish and Fowl, her lofty
and domineering Mountains, and mountainous
Ascents burdned with Firs, her pleasant and fer|til
Fields fill'd with Corn, and her Meadows and
Pastures crowded with Herds of Cattle, but that
he will conclude with me, that her Cities and
Sea-ports flourish under the Conduct of Trade
and Navigation. And where the gilded <HI>High|lands</HI>
are the Lowlanders Prospect, and the
Skirts of the Hills sanctuary to the bordering
Planes, shading her Plants from the fiery Strokes
of the Sun in Summer, that defends them a|gainst
impetuous and immoderate Cold in Win|ter,
incident there to in regard so situated, that
it lies North Latitude near fifty nine Degrees,
though reaching the Cusp of our Southern Si|tuations.</P>
<P>Formerly, I confess, I flattered my self with
<HI>Scotland</HI>'s Intemperance; but my Opinion is o|therwise
now, because having sufficiently exa|mined
to the contrary, and adjudg it an Error
in any Man to denounce Sentence before Exami|nation.
Are the Artick and Antartick Poles at
variance, because of Distance and seemingly
contrary Actings? or stand they in opposition
one to another, because <HI>Aristotle</HI>'s Philosophy
could not reconcile them? Must it therefore
follow that there's no Correspondency, no Con|gruity
nor Harmony betwixt them? when it's
evident they are exerted by the Universal Spirit
of Nature, whereby they act and react upon
one another: else would the Tides of them|selves
stand still, and because wanting Motion,
the Ocean would stagnate, and at last result in
<PB N="xviii" REF="11">
Putrefaction; so by consequence invite a new
Creation.</P>
<P>Let <HI>Scotland</HI> therefore be <HI>England</HI>'s <HI>Chalybs,</HI>
and let <HI>England</HI> be unto <HI>Scotland</HI> a Magnet to
attract, contemporate, and mingle those Nor|thern
Severities, by Southern softned Reflecti|ons
of moderate Heat; lest peradventure the
Rose withers, and the Thistle meet with the
fatal Stroak of the Syeth. Nature is but one in
all her Operations. So let these two famous
and flourishing Kingdoms survive their Ene|mies,
whilst I strip off some of <HI>Scotland</HI>'s sweet|est
Flowers, to present them to <HI>Cambridg,</HI> the
place of my Nativity, with this legitimate fair
One; intending her an Academian there, be|cause
I fancy in Time she may grow a Profi|cient,
when at present to appear so amiable in
Rags; and probably deserves better Orna|ments
than my slender Education is capable to
give her, whereby to manuduct her to point
the Ground, till she her self treads the Stage
of the World, as her Heroick Ancestors have
done before her.</P>
<P>In the mean time, let me flatter my self,
that no Gentleman will be so ingenteel to
censure my Survey, because not lineally Ar|tificial.
I grant my Methods might have been
reformed by riper Judgments, and my Dis|course
placed in better Order, which possibly
merits a Reproof: but I have this for An|swer,
that I'm but a young Practitioner in
the Press; and because finding my self ob|liged
to conduct and pilot a Northern Prin|cess
ashore, I laboured all I could to bring her
<PB N="xix" REF="11">
to the Borders, expecting some others in
readiness there to give her Entertainment.
But I found my self defeated, and this
beautiful fair One neglected, notwithstand|ing
all the Shores were crowded with Spe|ctators,
that viewed and reviewed her modest
Approaches, yet none had the Manners to
bid her Welcome. However, since she is come,
I'll present her to the Angler that treads the
shady Tracts and beautiful Shores of <HI>Cam:</HI>
together with the rest of the Fraternity of
the Rod, that ramble the Margin of famous
<HI>Thames, Trent, Severn, Owse, Tweed, Tine,
Eden, Ask, Dove, Darwin, Tees, Yor, Air,
Need,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now since no Art more than Angling ele|vates
and advances the generous Mind of the
Contemplative Angler, let me invite and en|courage
him to patrole the solitary Streams
of <HI>Trent,</HI> if he purpose to undergo the Toil
of the Art, before he publish himself an Ar|tist:
for the Practicks of Angling won't ap|pear
legible, whilst the Theory remains pa|radoxically
unintelligible, (here's a Cypher
prick'd down instead of a Figure) so that
should I emblazon or intitle my self an Ar|tist,
or a Proficient of the Rod, how can I
avoid running the Risque of being reputed
Ostentatious? On the other Hand, to remain
silent after the Periods of Forty Years Ex|ercise,
every Angler will censure me igno|rant,
and my Silence interpret me wilfully
obstinate. Thus I steer betwixt <HI>Sylla</HI> and <HI>Cha|rybdis.</HI>
But as I cannot impede or hinder the
<PB N="xx" REF="12">
Thoughts or Suggestions of any Man, so by
the Law of Retaliation, no Man ought to hin|der
or misinterpret my modest Resolutions,
when but to challenge the Degree of an Under|graduate
in the Art. Nor have I confidence
to raise my Ambitions higher; than to super|scribe
my self an Admirer of the Rod, and
a Lover of silent and solitary Streams. Let
my Writings therefore remonstrate my Ex|periments,
and my Experiments manifest my
Zeal for Solitudes, and my natural affection to

we forfeit not only our Reason, but Reli|gion;
so not to dedicate some part of my
Experiments to your Ingenious Society, might
justly prohibit me the freedom of tracing your
flourishing Fields and fragrant Meadows, ina|mel'd
with Flowers, that perfume the beautiful
Suburbs of <HI>Trent;</HI> upon whose delightful Banks
I formerly used to spend some solitary Hours,
in pursuit of the scaly Fry, and where the Plen|ty
and sweet Situations invited me not only to
contemplate, but improve this mystical Art of
Angling: though it's true, the Rudiments (in
the minority of Youth) were laid in <HI>Cam;</HI> yet
Silver <HI>Trent</HI>'s orient Streams graduated my ju|niour
Experiments, by unfolding her Meanders,
and making obvious the Intrigues of her rapid
Fords, replenished with variety; nay so great
variety of Fish, that only to express it would
almost bring Truth into Suspicion; when from
the more profound and solitary Deeps, the Ar|tist
(if expert) may summons up Lucit, and
the generous Race of Salmon.</P>
<P><PB N="xxii" REF="13">
But, Gentlemen, I am not Angling now, I'm
only telling you those original Motives to this
solitary (and Piscatorian) Science, that grew
up with me when an Adult; for then I courted
the shady Streams of <HI>Cam;</HI> but <HI>Trent</HI> (as I told
you above) gave me Education. To <HI>Trent</HI>
therefore (and the Place of my Nativity) I di|rect
my Influences, let Malice do its worst; nor
are they extravagant Notions, nor broken Frag|ments,
collected from Foreign nor Domestick
Authority, but lineal and practical Experiments
and Demonstrations, drawn up and cultivated
by the Mediums of Art, and the exact Methods
of Observation; which without vanity, I de|dicate
to your Society inhabiting the flourishing
Ports of <HI>Nottingham;</HI> which I doubt not you'l
accept of, though not much to inrich you;
however you may taste of those solitary Hours
laboriously spent in <HI>Great-Britain</HI>'s <HI>Hellespont,</HI>
(the famous <HI>Trent</HI>) where I used to refresh my
self, and ramble up and down her delightful
Fords, to gratify and satisfy others as well as
my self with the Fruits of Experience. So that
should I call Sea and Land <HI>Elizium,</HI> it's not al|together
improper so to do, since Earth and
Water compleat but one Globe.</P>
<P>In those florid Fields, near the Fords of <HI>Trent,</HI>
I frequently wandred up and down to crop the
Buds of Experience; yet I plundred no Man's
Orchard to enrich my Arbory, nor borrowed I
other Mens Labours to adorn my Discoveries:
the Bounty of Heaven, that always blest me
with benevolent Success, restrained me from
rifling the Records of my Ancestors; when
<PB N="xxiii" REF="13">
to put a Rod in my Hand, and place a River
before me: so that I should offer Violence to
Reason and Art, if now to consult the Autho|rity
of others, when such a large and legible
Folio to write by, as the great and stupendous
Volume of the Creation; which to contemplate,
interprets the Divine Practice of Solitudes, and
becomes not only contributary to the present,
but the future Generations.</P>
<P>To study Contemplation is the high way to
Heaven, where the Suburbs consist of a Divine
Composition, and where you may read by those
Oracles the Stars, the beautiful Order of Ce|lestial
Bodies, and the great and lesser World
all Harmony; for Heaven and Earth are Corre|lates,
which duly to contemplate, poises our Pas|sion,
and baffles our Pride; which necessarily
pursues the Foot-steps of Generation, as natu|rally
as Rust follows Copper, which without
dispute is the Death of the Compound; conse|quently
Tradition, if penitentially admitted,
and Ignorance opposed to the Mediums of Art;
there uncultivated Arts present no Dispon|dencies,
nor need a Man solicite Reality in Pra|cticks.
But this I oppose, and confidently assert,
he that licks up the fabulous Fiction of slip|pery
Authority, to confirm his false and unte|nable
Position, brings unsound Arguments to
prop and support the slender Faith his Opini|on
leans on; whereby he exposes himself to
Clamour and Reproach, and the Censure of
every judicious Examinant.</P>
<P>Give me leave therefore to remonstrate my
Resolution, since the Arguments and Allega|tions
<PB N="xxiv" REF="14">
in my Book are my own. Yet had I
rob'd <HI>Virgil</HI> to adorn my Muse, peradventure
my Fancy had been more fruitful; but take it
as it is, since so freely dedicated to the Vir|tuosos
of the Rod, from whom in modesty I
may reasonably expect some charitable Cen|sures
of this my Sober and Contemplative
Angler; advising them to direct to the Gno|men
of Practicks, omitting Theory, and the
useless Prescriptions of the Antients. Then
shall no Man need to grope the Invention of
others, but manifest every Truth by plain
Demonstration. Thus far I may safely sail
under the Angler's Protection: but should
I write Marginal Notes, and place them to
the Test of unpractical Anglers, beyond dis|pute
I should split on a Rock, and wanting a
Pilot to bring me off, I might live without
Hope, and die in Despair; which I resolve
against, whilst capable to write my Name,</P>

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LET me manuduct you through the slender
Margin of my uncultivated Book, to con|template
the Evangelical Sweets of Reason
and Religion, two requisite and necessary Prinici|ples
for a Christian. For since it hath pleased God,
through infinite Mercy, to breathe into Man a ra|tional
Soul, whereby he was made Lord of all the
Creation, to govern and conduct the Creatures
committed to his Charge, with respect of Duty to
his Sovereign Creator: this capacitates Man to act
prudentially; for imprudent Actions proceed from
Rashness, and the inconsiderate poize of Reason.
So to be religious, it's the Christian's <HI>Corona,</HI> that
enables him to contemplate his present State and
future Felicity: Which to accomplish, he must cru|ciate
himself with his Thoughts and his Lusts, and
strip himself of all imaginary Vanities, to rumi|nate
how the certain uncertain State of Mortality
in a Moment breaks up and terminates in Death.
And it's requisite it be so, since the Body's Solution
displays the Soul's glorious Ascension out of this
elementary Tabernacle of Earth and Clay; where|by
with more vivacity she may elevate her self on
the Wing of Faith, by Divine Attraction, to those
glorious and invisible Exaltations: which beatifical
Vision, no mortal Tongue can well express, nor can
<PB N="xxvi" REF="15">
Mortality conceive nor enjoy here, save only by a
Divine Faith, and a Holy and Heavenly Specu|lation.</P>
<P>Now, how necessary is the study and practice of
Christianity, the true, noble, and the heavenly
Birth! For a Christian is such by Regeneration, and
to be regenerate is a Child of God; and a Child of
God is a Saint here. For militant Saints in Grace
here, shall be triumphant Saints in Glory hereafter,
made beauteously to shine in the New <HI>Jerusalem,</HI>
and wear the Royal Badg of Heaven, and that's
an immortal Angelical Crown; to which is affix'd
the Diadem of the Divinest, in legible and intelli|gible
Characters of the Cross. God in Love with
his own Image, beautifies and adorns the Soul with
Immortality. It's true, Heaven knows no Limit
nor Dimension; but Earth has Periods. With what
Circumspection therefore ought we to travel through
this mortal Pilgrimage, to the sacred Temple of
Piety and Devotion, where the blessed Sweets of
Eternity, are perpetually tasted by contemplating a
Preparation for Death. And what is Death but the
Key of Eternity? These and such like pious Consi|derations,
lift up the standard of the Mind to the
Elevations of Contemplation. For if the Pro|gress
of Life be but one single Scene of a Tragedy,
of necessity the World must be the Theatre, Life the
Prologue, Heaven the Design, and Death the Exit.
So not only to live, but to live well, imports a well|dying;
and to die to Sin, is to live Eternally.</P>
<P>Thus whilst premeditating the Life of Solitudes,
give me leave to publish to the World this mystical
Art, and the Intrigues of Angling; and because
animated by the Mediums of Experience, I thought
it Argument good enough to gratify the Age, and re|ward
<PB N="xxvii" REF="15">
the Industirous with Trophies of the Art, which
indeed is the ultimate End and Period of Experi|ment.
Now tell me a better Accommodation than
what naturally flows from solitary Hours solemnly
dedicated to the Divinest; when to discourse with
Birds in shady Bowers, and converse with Fish in Ri|vers
and Rivulets; to obliterate the World and vain
Conversation; so take our flight as high as Heaven,
by Divine Faith and Heavenly Contemplation: such
a Life as this explains the Angler not only a Monu|ment
of Patience, but Experience: so that Ambiti|on
can never be a Bait to ensnare him, that already
is delivered from Pride, and the Arrests of Arro|gancy.
O how sweetly does such a Man's Habita|tion
smell, whose Entertainment and Salutation is
the Dialect of Peace, where every Action, if thorowly
examined, reads harmonious Lectures of Concord
and Content, labouring what in him lies to stand a
distance from this ambiguous World, whilst the World
pursues her flattering Admirers, and such only as
vainly heap up accursed Riches to perplex themselves,
and blast Posterity. But I fancy, and it may be
but a Fancy, that some prevaricating <HI>Zoilist</HI> will
arraign my Hypothesis, and stigmatize Anglers
(and the Art) with those black Blemishes of Barba|rity
and Cruelty, when only design'd to kill a Fish.
To which I reply, That the Creatures in the Creation
(by Divine Appointment) were appropriated for Vse,
and what may that Vse be, if not the Refreshment and
Nourishment of Mankind? <HI>Adam</HI> had a Commis|sion
from the King of Heaven, impowering him Lord
over all sublunary Creatures. Will any one que|stion
this Privilege? And <HI>Peter</HI> was commanded
to arise, kill and eat; when doubting with himself
the Legality of the thing, who disputes this Com|mission?
<PB N="xxviii" REF="16">
Now for any Man to question these Divine
Truths, (except a <HI>Banian</HI>) be questions the Scrip|tures,
the Authority of Truth. The Creatures in
the Creation (we must grant) were design'd for Nu|trition
and Sustentation; yet no Man had a Com|mission
so large to take away Life upon no other ac|count
than to gratify his Lust. Then the next Que|stion
arising will be, Whether the Rod or the Net is
rather to be approved of? I have only this to answer,
(since both contribute to Health and Maintenance)
the Apostles themselves they used the one, why then
may not the Angler plead for the other?</P>
<P>Thus far I enter the Angler's List, and resolve to
encounter this critical Age by promulgating the Series
of the Art of Angling. But to shape out Rods, twist
Lines, and appropriate Times and Seasons, with va|riety
of Waters, and sutability of Baits; as also
the making of Instruments, arming of Hooks, form|ing
the accurate Proportion of Flies, shaping of Corks,
staining of Quills, forming of Swivels, and drawing
out Wiers, besides casting of Plumbs, and moulding of
Shot, I resolve against; for it's nothing my Business,
though a Task neither intricate nor tedious to the se|veral
and various Artificers pregnant in the Art.
For that end you may dedicate your Opinion to what
scribling Putationer you please; the Compleat Ang|ler,
if you will, who tells you of a tedious Fly Story,
extravagantly collected from antiquated Authors,
such as <HI>Gesner, Dubravius, &amp;c.</HI> but I rather com|mend
you to famous <HI>Isaac Owldham,</HI> whose Expe|riences
sprung from the Academy of <HI>Trent:</HI> so did
that eminent Angler, <HI>George Merrils;</HI> and as
eminent as he was <HI>John Fawlkner,</HI> whose known
Abilities to cultivate this Science (both for Dire|ctions
and Manuels) I modestly prefer before any
other.</P>
<P><PB N="xxix" REF="16">
Yet how frequently is this Art promulged by Mud|lers,
and under the plausible pretence of Anglers?
when upon examine you'l find them deficient in
Practicks, and indigent in the lineal and plain Tracts
of Experience; yet so fortified with Confidence and
Ignorance, enough I declare to make an Artist blush,
if only but to hear them assert, that from one River
in a Nation, all the rest may be nationally under|stood:
which preposterous impertinent Opinion, if I
should not publickly oppose, it would seem to confirm
and assign me a Confederate with the Rout and Rab|ble
so ignorantly opinionated. But I shall offer my
reason, to avoid the suspicion of an Imposture, lest
I be thought to traduce my Proselytes into the extreams
of an Error; otherwise I had shrowded my self un|der
a Taciturnity, had not I dreaded the Censure of
other able and practical Anglers, that in reason may
expect a replication from me. For that end, I pub|lish
this Treatise to the World, where my Arguments
are synonymous, connect together like Links in a
Chain, in opposition to that inconsiderate Opinion,
that by one River all the Rivers in <HI>England, &amp;c.</HI>
may be included for Fish and Diversion. Which is
alike probable, that an Orchard without Cultivati|on,
should produce Foreign Fruit: or the <HI>Peak</HI> in
<HI>Derbyshire,</HI> should assign us Gold instead of Lead,
or the Minera of <HI>Oar.</HI></P>
<P>Now supposing this eminent difficulty resolved, yet
some will be solicitous to puzzle themselves about
Baits and Seasons; so that I foresee it will aggra|vate
and fret their intoxicated Patience: Where
note, such may search (as already prenoted) in the
mouldy Records of <HI>Androvanus, Dubravius, Ges|ner,</HI>
or <HI>Isaac Walton,</HI> whose Authority to me seems
alike authentick, as is the general Opinion of the
<PB N="xxx" REF="17">
vulgar prophetick: for neither all nor one of them is
an Oracle to me, Experience is my Master, and
Angling my Exercise; yet moderated so, that I
don't always employ my self with throwing in, nor
haling out, as Pochers do, that covet more than their
Panniers contain; this makes the Sweet of their La|bours
unprofitable, when the Angler only designs Di|version
the final end of his Recreation. However,
somewhat of this Nature is expected from me, other|wise
the Prejudicate will conclude me ignorant, or af|fected
with paucity: but I shall prevent that Sus|picion,
by publishing to the World this Treatise of
Angling; wherein the Practicks are manifestly di|vulged,
though the Contemplative be but in part ex|press'd.
And what hinders (I pray you) to with|draw
sometimes from the trembling Streams of
<HI>Trent,</HI> to dedicate your vacant Hours to the Shrines
of Solitudes; to sit upon Rocks, or in shady Groves;
there to contemplate the beautiful Creation, and medi|tate
our present and eternal furture State; so with a ho|ly
and reverentical Fear, call to mind the Creator and
Original of all Things; through whose Wisdom
Kings rule, and Princes decree Iustice? But doubt|ing
some may want other moral Inducements, to such
I have brought a Glass of Morality, wherein they
may view the World's state of Inconstancy; but to
the more religious and contemplative Angler, a Mo|del
of Piety, (<HI>Jacob</HI> will struggle hard for a Bles|sing)
where be may see the inamour'd and Seraphick
Soul surmount the <HI>Aether,</HI> whilst Earth-worms
like-Otters prey below upon Fish.</P>
<P>Now to such as love Travel, I have brought them
History, but to such others as love Fish and plea|sant
Waters, my Treatise: for the studious Geogra|pher,
here are Cities and Countries, but for the
<PB N="xxxi" REF="17">
active Engineer, Castles and Citadels. Should thy
Fancy be mean, here are shallow Brooks; deep Rivers
require the skilful Art of Swimming. Thus my
Book seems a Mart, where a Man may trade for
Trifles, or merchandise for things of greater Va|lue.
The World is all Purchase, and Death the
Pay-master. Think not therefore to naturalize
Earth into Heaven, since every thing adheres and
partakes of its own Nature. I advise therefore the
Lovers of a solitary Life, to study Sobriety, Tem|perance,
Patience and Chastity; for these Divine
Blessings are the Gift of God. So is Contemplati|on,
which never shines so clearly as when retired
from the World and worldly Incumbrances. Woods,
Rocks, Grotta's, Groves, Rivers and Rivulets are
Places pick'd out for Contemplation; where you may
consider Creational Work, and melt with the war|bling
Notes of <HI>Philomel,</HI> and the innocent Harmo|ny
of musical Birds, that deliciate the Air, and de|light
the Attention. Or you may proportion your
Meditations with the Pulse of the Ocean, or the soft
and murmuring Complaints of purling Streams, that
imprint their Passions as they pass along, when melt|ing
the smiling florid Banks.</P>
<P>Nature consults no Artificer to imbellish and adorn
her illaborate Works; and shall the God of Heaven,
the great Creator, draw his Lines from the faint
Shadows of Nature? Pray but consider, who makes
the Sea keep her regular Motion, the Constellati|ons
their Rotations, and the erratick Stars roll in
their several Orbs? Are not all the Reins of Govern|ment
in the Divine Hand of him that made them?
Is not the Christian's Diadem, and the Purchase of
the Cross there? Liberty and Freedom there? the
sweet Tranquillity of Peace there? the blessed Society
<PB N="xxx" REF="18">
of Saints and Angels there? Iustice and Mercy
there? the results also of Life and Death there?
And where shall we be found if not there, in those
everlasting Arms of Beatitude, that exert our Souls
by the Divine Ray of Contemplation?</P>
<P>Study Patience, practise Humility, and let Re|pentance
be our daily Exercise; since these with o|ther
Vertues, are Duties incumbent. Then may we
sing <HI>Hallelujahs</HI> at an Angelical pitch; and that's
a strain above the World's <HI>Ela.</HI> These, and such
like Divine Impressions, we ought to imprint on our
immortal Minds, when with impatieney we pursue
our Exercise, either to the River, or solitary Lough.
For the Taper burns, and the Thread of Life (be|cause
lap'd up in this fine tiffany Web of Mortality)
like a Meteor terminates sometimes in a Blaze:
Too late then to confer with Reason, or think of Re|ligion.
So farewel, and be happy in the Rules of
Friendship; but happier to live in the amiable Arms
of Vertue, ever honoured, and admired, by thy
Friend</P>

<HEAD>A Brief DESCRIPTION of the Cities,

Contemplative Angler.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theophilus.</SPEAKER>
<P>IT was in <HI>April</HI> when every Bough
look'd big with Blessings, and
the florid Fields, and fragrant
Meadows (adorn'd with Green)
sent forth their sweet and redolent Perfumes to
refresh the Universe. <HI>Chanticleer</HI> then gave the
Day a Summons, and the early Lark, earlier
than the Sun, salutes the Air, whilst blushing
<HI>Phebus</HI> paints and gilds the Azure Globe, whose
Celestial Influence (by refulgent Magnetism)
blest all the World with Prolifick Blessings: so
that the whole Creation began to vegitate, and
every Vegetation sent forth sweet <HI>Aroma's;</HI> the
Birds began now to build their Nests, and every
Bird to choose his Mate; whilst the Groves and
delightful Springs, as also the Forests and un|frequented
Desarts celebrated the fragrant
Spring; when the frigid Congelations of Frost
and Snow were all struck dead by the blazing
fiery strokes of the Sun.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnoldus.</SPEAKER>
<P>What infer you from these pretty
Metaphors?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I infer thus much: The Vernon In|gress
smil'd a Blessing, when she sent the melo|dious
Harmony of Birds to melt the Air. The
<PB N="2" REF="23">
Nightingale with her warbling Notes, the
Blackbird, Thrush, Linnet, and Golden-Jay, be|sides
the Canary and delicious Bulfinch, fill'd all
the Woods with their solitary Strains: And be|cause
beating the Air with such proportionable
Harmony, every Bush became an Aviary, and
every Grove a mellifluous Consort, whilst the
purling Springs, and more shady Rivulets, soft|ned
by the gentle Breathings of <HI>Zephyrus,</HI>
seemed tacitly to express a secret, whispering,
silent Praise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>To whom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>To whom think you? unto <HI>Iehovah</HI>
the great Creator.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well exprest! Proceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Things thus posited, under such a recto|ral
Governance, my Reason, and all my Facul|ties
were excited to contemplate the excellent
Beauty of this stupendous Creation: but above
all, when to consider Man Lord of this Crea|tional
Work, and invested with Power to con|duct
the Creatures, and intrusted with the
Cargo of the whole Creation; this I confess
was very surprizing, when but to consider him
in a Natural State, and compare him with the
Excellency of Celestial Beings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>What observe you from thence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I observe him complicated, and com|pounded
of Elements; and Elements of them|selves
they drop in sunder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what if you take him translated
into a State of Grace and Regeneration?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then I'll grant the first Death is
past, and the second Death shall have no power
to hurt him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="23">
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>So far you'll grant him to excel all
created Beings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes: But not as he stands in a Na|tural
State.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do but consider him a living Monu|ment
of Praise, inrich'd with all the Endow|ments
of natural Perfection; besides those emi|nent
Qualifications of Piety, which intitle him
Excellent, and confirm him a Creature adorn'd
with all the signal Marks and shining Characters
of this stupendous Creation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why not so? Does not the Lion
and the Leopard, with the Tiger, Wolf, Pan|ther
and Vulture, pay their Veneration to him?
Does not his very Aspect confound the Croca|dile?
and with one superficial Glance of his
Eye, he mortifies the Basilick. Consider the
Composure of his Face and Features, together
with the delicate Frame, and his well-compos'd
Fabrick of Body: Do not these present him a
Composition of Majesty? Surely it does: for
all the Creatures honour and adore him, which
demonstrates him a Monarch, and of such a
Princely Soveraignty, that the whole Creation
pay their Services to him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>You wilfully misinterpret me, or pre|varicate
your own Judgment, by taking wrong
Measures. That Dignity and Vertue (you
sum up) that formerly shin'd as a Ray about
him, is now become a Cloud, a promiscuous
Cloud to obscure him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can I mistake my self, when
to consider him in a most eminent State; and
such a Capacity of Beauty and Excellency,
<PB N="4" REF="24">
that the maz'd World think him more than a
Monarch?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>They may think what they will of
his Primitive State, but convinc'd by Experience,
he is not so now. It's true, the time was, when
all the Creatures with a solid Submission hum|bled
themselves before him; but that was then
in his State of Innocency, in <HI>Eden</HI>'s fair Fields,
before Transgression, before he unhappily found
out the Art of Sinning; then and there it was
they paid their Veneration, but do they so
now? We experience to the contrary: for the
Beauty and Majesty of that glorious Image was
so macerated and torn by the Talons of Sin,
that it has grown up since to a Flood, to deluge
Posterity. This Act of Disobedience divested
our Protoplast, and influenced his Successors so,
that every Generation since <HI>Adam,</HI> has laboured
under the same Predicament; for that de|thron'd
<HI>Adam</HI> in Paradise, disinherited us, and
<HI>Adam</HI>'s Posterity; there it was Man lost his
Prerogative; and here it is, Sin makes us less
than Men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can one single Act in our Protoplast
so vacate the Royal Grant of Prerogative, to
enervate the Conduct of succeeding Genera|tions?
Surely no. The glorious Act of Go|vernment
shines universally in Man, and will so
to the succeeding Generations. The whole
Creation was placed in a Posture of Servitude
to <HI>Adam,</HI> as he himself stood a Subject in Obe|dience
to his Creator. So that if I rightly un|derstand
Creational Work, the great End was
to discover hidden things, and manifest Idea's,
with the Consequent of Production of their va|rious
<PB N="5" REF="24">
Species. So that, under Submission, I may
as rationally conclude, that the Creatures in the
Creation have now, as then, a natural Right to
bend their Submissions to Man's Princely Sove|raignty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I very much doubt it; for no sooner
<HI>Adam</HI> lost his Prerogative, but he he felt a Tre|pedation
invade all his Vitals, and his Soul be|gan
to blush within him, because afrighted with
the Aspect of Sin, that at a distance presented
him the Picture of Death: now the same Death
that strangled him, strangles all his Posterity.
Thus it was when <HI>Adam</HI> lost his Government,
and thus it is with us when governing impru|dently;
for till then the Creation was unac|quainted
with Disguise; nor till then did the
Creature relinquish his Authority, till he re|linquished
his Primitive Simplicity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>What happened then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>There happened a Change in all the
Creatures, because they perceived a Change in
their Conduct; where note, ever since that ge|neral
Revolt, the Creatures have been cautious
to repose a Trust under mortal Protection, be|cause
destitute of Power to govern himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you deny Man a Soveraign
Power and Divine Right, to intitle himself
Universal Monarch?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's not the Point in Dispute: I
have already granted, that <HI>Adam</HI>'s Divine
Graces sprung spontaneously from the refulgent
Ray of the Majesty of God. But what is that
to us? Can we restrain our Hands from Blood,
and our Hearts from Malice, and precogitated
Sin? Now every Man knows the Reward of
<PB N="6" REF="25">
Sin is not Death simply, but Divine Justice, and
Divine Justice bars out all the Footsteps of
Mercy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's undeniable; however I'm
convinc'd, that could we but govern our own
Irregularities, our Passions, our Ambitions, and
exorbitant Desires, we should shine like Stars
(among Men) and seem in some sort almost
immortal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>That word (almost) was well put in:
but to the Argument, as to Point of Govern|ment;
if unlike Christians we govern our selves,
we tacitly slide into the Inconveniency of Slaves;
and such we may suspect our selves to be, be|cause
to sink under the weight of every single
Temptation, by which means we sully all those
excellent Privileges that adorned our Protoplast
in his Primitive State.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>What State then must we call this, a
State of Apostacy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may call it what you please; for
every Man is in a State good or bad, but worst
of all is that State that lifts up its Hand to rebel
against Heaven: Such were the Giants in the
days of old, and such are we now because over|grown
in Sin. How often have we violated the
Authority of our Commission? and how often
have infring'd the Liberties of the Creation?
Now in the Primitive State there were no such
Proceeds; for then the Creatures flew as natu|rally
to <HI>Adam</HI>'s Hand, as terrified now they fly
from ours. The Turtle then was heard in every
Grove, now they coo no where except in Avi|aries:
all the Families of Birds then fill'd the
Air, now they are compell'd to whistle in Cages:
<PB N="7" REF="25">
then they exprest their Gratitude with Demon|strations
of Joy; now they lament their De|stiny,
because doomed to die. This was the
Golden Age our Ancestors liv'd in, but it's the
Iron Age we live in now. For Innocency in
effect is almost lost, and it's well if we lose not
our selves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>However I cannot yield to this Con|clusion;
that <HI>Adam</HI>'s Commands were so torn
and macerated, that surviving Posterity should
neglect their Obedience: For if when to consider
how many Generations have travelled through
the Map of Time (from our Ancestors to us)
and Time you know informs us of Experience;
How rational is it then to conclude (but I
only offer it for Argument-sake) that was <HI>Adam</HI>
repossess'd of Paradise again, and premonished
of Sin, (as we are daily precautioned) whether
or no it might not be thought to raise a Circum|spection
in him, to evade the Serpent, the Sin,
and the Woman's Temptation? Into this Opi|nion
most Ages have crept, and our Modern
Assertors, and Predicators approve on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's a Point beyond my Sphere; I
meddle not with <HI>why may not's;</HI> however I
allow you a Privilege, and freedom of think|ing
or saying what you please; but then you
ought not to circumscribe Bounds to another.
However, this I assert, That such was the Ori|ginal
Purity of <HI>Adam,</HI> in his State of Innocency,
that his Graces then shined with Heavenly Rays,
and Heaven we know is all Generosity. But
every Generation since <HI>Adam,</HI> has so diminished
that Beauty and Lustre, that from Men we are
almost dwindled into Morts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="8" REF="26">
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but my Friend, have you well
considered, how that the formal Fabrick of
Man's Natural Body, doth represent unto us
the World's Epitome? Why not then by the
glorious Speculation of his Mind (under a re|novating
and regenerate State of Grace) he
may represent something of the invisible Glo|ries?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>You come near to the Point; Did
not the Generations more and more degene|rate?
but this beyond Precedent has outdone all
the rest. For by offering Violence against all
that's good, will at last offer Violence against
it self; and this is but just by the Law of Re|taliation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because so vehement in the pursuit
of Sin, we outdo our Ancestors; and what's
the Conclusion? <HI>Adam</HI> you see was made an
Exile, and compell'd to relinquish the Sun-shine
of Paradise, he was forced to sit down under
the Shades of <HI>Mesopotamia:</HI> but we renounce
both Law and Gospel, to monopolize the
World, and aggrandize Posterity; this is now
our deplorable State, compare it with <HI>Adam</HI>'s,
and give your Opinion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>My Opinion in short is, <HI>Adam</HI> comes
short of us: for as he was the Father of all his
Posterity, so, as Father, we patronize all man|ner
of Impiety. Now I have given you my
Opinion, how do you approve on't?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll sum it up thus. Whilst <HI>Adam</HI>
stood in Purity his Beauty shin'd without De|formity;
so that by the Will of the Divinest,
had he kept his Station, Posterity had never
<PB N="9" REF="26">
been doom'd to die by the cold and icie Finger
of Death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>O <HI>Theophilus!</HI> that one single Sin
should so deform him that was elevated and ex|alted
above the Beauties in the Creation!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just so it happ'ned to that bright Star
<HI>Lucifer,</HI> (and his aspiring Conspirators) whose
Ambition dethron'd him, and so it will us. He
striving to get above that that was super-excel|lent,
lost that Excellency the Supreamest had
given him. So we placing our Affections on
exteriour Objects, we but inamour our selves
with our own Similitudes: Judg of the Conse|quence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is the Law of Nature a standing
Rule or no? If it be a Rule, it ought to be o|beyed;
for its natural in kind to answer kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can Nature, as Nature, exert our
Zeal, to stir up in us the lively Act of Faith?
Surely Faith is no Part of Creational Work, it's
rather a Bough or Branch that buds up from
Regeneration. The Excellency therefore of
the things that are, are not of themselves, but
dependent on some other infinitely more glori|ous;
such is the Creator.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>He that made the World had no
need of Assistance; but all things that are made
were made by him alone. Creational Work
therefore was discovering hidden Ideas, and
making Invisibles to appear visible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>God the Creator made himself ma|nifest,
in time, by his glorious Act of Power,
in creating; who by his eternal Wisdom and
Providence upholds it, that it drops not asun|der.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="10" REF="27">
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's manifest by the Eye of Sense;
but he that sees by the Eye of Faith, sees be|yond
the Creation, for he sees the Creator; and
in seeing him, he sees his Redeemer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then struggle we so hard after
superficial Knowledg, to defeat our selves by
the dull Prospect of Sense; for if when to cre|ate
Inquietudes in our selves, we labour and toil
with unprofitable Anxiety?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>What but the Curse anticipates the
Blessing? Man and the Creation were made in
time, and Time was drawn out by the Wisdom
of God; but the Understandings of most Men
differently discerning, differently distinguish,
till Time, the Harbinger of Eternity, eats out
his Character, so translates him to the Shades
of his silent Sepulchre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>What infer you from this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Solomon</HI> was a Man inspir'd with Wis|dom,
and endued with Understanding; and
God gave him Eyes to foresee the Vicissitude and
Revolution of Times and States.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Solomon</HI> had a Divine Soul, incorpo|rated
with humane Nature, whose Ambition
(if proper to say so) coveted Wisdom rather
than Wealth: and God answered his Desires.
In that Day <HI>Solomon</HI> was the Jewish Oracle: but
every Day is the Almighty's Holy-day, and
Time and the World like a Globe in his Hand.
Consider therefore, the same Excellency of Spi|rit
<HI>Solomon</HI> had, hovers still over us, like a Glo|ry
about us; and by Divine Permission over e|very
Generation: But because falling short of
<HI>Solomon</HI>'s Knowledg (and Divine Speculation)
we do not as <HI>Solomon,</HI> all alike discern.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="27">
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Grant the Argument admits of no
Contradiction, yet you will find it a Task diffi|cult
enough, to study the Art of Self-resigna|tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Solomon,</HI> you grant, he refused Wealth
for Wisdom. But what think you of <HI>Saul,</HI> that
went as far as <HI>Endor,</HI> and rak'd up the Ashes of
the Dead, to enquire a Victory?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think the Case different, both in
Nature and Quality; the one chose Wisdom,
but the other Witchcraft: so to connect them
together, draws on a false Conclusion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then the Consequence follows;
<HI>Saul</HI>'s reasoning with Flesh and Blood, as it was
impious; so his Application to Sorcerers and
Necromancers was also diabolical, who to ac|complish
the End of his Conspiracy, consults
not <HI>Endor</HI> only, but the Brood of Infernals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>He did so, who denies it? I know
what you'll alledg, you'll tell me the Tree is
known by its Fruits. I grant all this, and what
then? yet I dare not interpret <HI>Saul</HI> a Son of Per|dition:
God's Mercy never wants Wings to fly
to the disconsolate Penitent, whose Mercy su|per-excels
his Divine Acts of Justice. Therefore
judg not <HI>Saul,</HI> lest we judg our selves, when by
the Heart only things are legibly construed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's true; the Heart made legible,
discovers a Phenix or a Vulture; the first living,
(as <HI>Hippocrates</HI> says) and the last dying: so that
neither Physick nor Philosophy can make mortal
immortal. There's neither Energy nor Excel|lency
in the superficial Form: Vertue lies con|ceal'd,
as a Jewel in a Cabinet: No Man there|fore
can be read by his Species.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="28">
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>To grant your Conclusion, proves
the thing less difficult in knowing others, than
to search within to know our selves. <HI>Solomon</HI>
had Wisdom and Divine Discoveries; and <HI>Saul</HI>
had Courage to encounter the Philistines.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>That Authority that tolerates <HI>Solo|mon</HI>
to have Wisdom, the same Authority con|cludes
<HI>Saul</HI> inquisitive after Witches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Admit it does, (what then?) that
Power that gives Life a Being, is indisputably
more noble than the thing that has Life. God
created the World, and by Wisdom animated
it with Life; so that Life shines every where,
in every Individual; this is manifest to every
Man, and every Creature that breaths in the
Creation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>This I agree in, but I can't reconcile
my self to your Opinion, that <HI>Solomon</HI> and <HI>Saul</HI>'s
Case run in parallel Lines: <HI>Lucifer</HI> and <HI>Micha|el,</HI>
though Stars of the first Magnitude, yet
they paid not equal Adoration to their sove|reign
Superiour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't question but you will grant,
that nothing has Life of it self, but from some|thing
else that's eminently superiour: That
the World is governed by Divine Providence,
and that every Beginning is destinated to Death
in time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this I grant, what infer you from
thence?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>I infer and observe you are somewhat
too severe in censuring <HI>Saul</HI>'s Sin by the Rule of
your Judgment unpardonable. Now for one Man
to take upon him to judg another, he betrays his
Rashness, because his Judgment is not infallible.</P>

upon Mercy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must tell you that God is a merci|ful
Judg, whose Mercy, as recorded, is above
all his Works; and a Mystery so sacred and se|cretly
conceal'd, that Angels themselves dare
not pry into it; How then shall Man discover
this admirable <HI>Arcanum</HI> of Mercy, when lock'd
up in the secret Cabinet of Heaven? Let us not
assume such previous Conjecturals, but rather
consult and expostulate Death, since Death is
the Wages and the Reward of Sin. Man and
the World terminate in the Arms of Death,
because they alike consist of elementary Princi|ples:
But Death will be found the Extinguisher
of Life, except that Life that's lighted by the
Torch of Regeneration; that Life will outlive
the second Death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you'l agree in this, that a vici|ous
Man living (and reigning) in Sin all the
Days of his Life, his Life may be taken for a
living Death.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll comply with any thing except
Censoriousness; for that end trumpet not <HI>Solo|mon</HI>'s
Praise too loud, lest the Eccho resound|ing,
ecchoes Ostentation. On the other Hand,
not to hope an Indemnity for <HI>Saul,</HI> we straiten
God's Mercy, which is infinitely boundless. So
let's leave it to the Judg of all the World: for
if the World be left to determine this Case,
she'll denounce a false Judgment, because of her
Partiality. Nay, she may be suspected uncha|ritable
too; and such are we, if Children of
the World, because subject to err by the Rule
of Instability.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="29">
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>You bear hard upon me, yet I'm loth
to give up the Cause; there's little or no Diffe|rence
in the length of our Weapons: but this
I'll say, so drop the Argument. <HI>Solomon</HI> was
an Oracle of Wisdom and Learning, and the
blazing Star that shin'd in <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> And <HI>Saul</HI>
was a King, and the first King in <HI>Israel;</HI> but
then he was that King God gave in his Wrath,
which was soon after removed, for <HI>David</HI> stood
in <HI>Saul</HI>'s way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>So did <HI>Vriah</HI> in his, when inamoured
on his Wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>But <HI>David</HI> was a Prophet, and a Man
of God; and <HI>Saul</HI> was censured for his impious
Exorcisms, as if the Tincture of Regeneration
was obliterated in him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>God forbid that the Sting of Sin
should be so venemous a Poison, that no Anti|dote
can cure it! Did not the Lord of Life die
to conquer Sin, and Death, and Hell, in every
Believer? Let us be so charitable as to parallel
<HI>Saul</HI> with <HI>Sampson,</HI> who had his <HI>Dalilah,</HI> as <HI>Saul</HI>
had his <HI>Endor.</HI> Here we read that <HI>David</HI> found
Repentance, after the Prophet's Reproof: And
<HI>Sampson</HI> had his Satisfaction upon the Lords of
the Philistines. These two had their Pardon
feal'd before Death; and fain would I be so cha|ritable
to conclude so of <HI>Saul.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but <HI>Saul</HI>'s Fault is writ in Capi|tal
Characters.</P>
</SP>

the Hypocrisy of the Times?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's rare (to a Miracle) to find Faith
amongst Men, especially such as daily expose
Conscience to the wreck of Opinion: And he
that makes a God of his Belly, devotes all his
Services to his luxurious Appetite. Thus Men,
as by Machination, traduce one another into
the Devil's School, to brazen themselves against
the Modesty of a Blush, lest Sin should be thought
to be shame-fac'd: And others raking up the
Embers of Revenge, fire themselves by quench|ing
the Flames.</P>

<P>So let them. But what's all this to
our Angling Design?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stay a little till we come to the Wa|ter-side:
In the mean time I have a Question to
put, and that's this; How comes it to pass that
the Hinge and Poize of Politick States, move
and turn about with such rapid Motions, that
Kingdoms and Potentates are dash'd in pieces?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Naturalist, we see him consult
Natural Causes, and the Judicial Astrologer Pla|netary
Events; but the more Religious devotes
himself to the Providence of God. Is there not
a Time for Frost, and a Time for Hail? a Time
for Rain, and a Time for fair Weather? a Time
for Revolution, Dissolution and Death? and all
these Times and various Changes are exercised
by him that holds the Poize and Ballance of Go|vernment.
<PB N="16" REF="30">
That Naturalist therefore that con|cludes
a Divinity in Celestial Influences, does but
grope in the dark; and the Astrologer pins his
Faith upon other Mens Sleeves.</P>

<P>You tread upon the Heels of my for|mer

you. The Prince of this World rules in the
Air, insinuating himself into the Heart of Man,
from whence comes War, and the Rumours of
War, as Rapine, Ravages, Murder and Blood.
Does not Pride strut up in the Face of Piety,
and Hell presume to justle Heaven? And can
Good and Evil (think you) run in parallel
Lines? No <HI>Arnoldus,</HI> I perswade my self, this
Age lives within one Step of Destruction, were

<PB N="17" REF="30">
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is good Advice, but still me|thinks
I see a Storm coming; not that I prog|nosticate
another Revolution; No, no, rather
a Desolation by Sword or Famine: for Sin,
like a Granade, tears up all before it, and rips
up the Foundation of Kingdoms and Common-wealths.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, Sin is the original Cause of
all National Calamity; and there is no Satis|faction
for Sin, but the Death of a Saviour:
The Cross must purchase the Crown: The old
Man must die to seal the Regenerate Birth.
What have we to do but consider the transitory
State of things, and the Stability of that that
gave them a Being? Here's nothing but rum|bling

<P>By this prophetick Discourse, me|thinks
I smell a strong Scent of Invasion. But
where the Storm will fall, God he only knows.
Are not the Nations about us like an Acaldemy of
Blood, that darkens the Air, and terrifies my
Pen to write such dismal and tragical Appre|hensions?
Will not the Sword, Plague and Fa|mine
contend for a Victory? O how sad will it
be to see the Father fall by the Dint of Sword,
the Mother crawl by the infected Walls of a
Pesthouse, and the poor innocent and com|fortless
Infant perish in the Streets, and pine
away with Hunger? Three such meciless and

Christendom.</P>

<P>Then where's our Security, and what
signifies the Strength or the Artifice of Man,
when God has a Controversy with the King|doms

and opposes the Gospel and Divine Oracles
to humane Tradition, and the vain imaginary

opens the Portals of Hell, and advances
the Curse instead of the Cross? What must
we conclude from such dreadful Consequences,
but that God will tear the Nations in pieces?</P>

<P>There was a Time when the Law
shin'd bright; yet at the same time the Gospel
shin'd behind the Horns of the Altar, (but in

<P>The Times were bless'd in those
Halcion Days, when our Patriarch <HI>Iacob</HI> was
clothed with Innocency; but in this our Day
we are all turn'd <HI>Esau's,</HI> to pursue the World

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>We read in the <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> that the
Seed of <HI>Hagar</HI> stood in opposition to the Seed
of <HI>Sarah.</HI> But <HI>Abraham</HI>'s God will dwell in
Tents, rather than in Temples with the Prince

<P>When the Turk turns Christian,

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then he'll be fit to turn Roman Ca|tholick,
to stamp the Cross on every Service,
and Vengeance with a Semiter on the Breasts of
Protestants: to immure their Proselytes betwixt
Stone-walls, so starve them to Death under
Pretence of Sanctity; and because not to die
a violent Death, the Anchorite fancies he dies
not at all. Is not this a fine way to mortify the
Flesh, when at the same time they'll surfeit with
Fish? that grope in the dark at Noon-day, and

<P>I look on the Hierarchy of the Church
of <HI>Rome,</HI> like Men that encounter a blasted
Fate: Where Priests are Saints Bells, but de|fective

dumb in Explanation: that kindle their Ta|pers
to blaze in the Temple, and consecrate
Sacrifices without a Blessing; so cover their
Nakedness with a Babylonish Garment: Where
Mattins are metamorphosed into Masquins, Col|lects
translated into Collations, and St. <HI>Antho|ny</HI>'s
<PB N="20" REF="32">
Bells into nocturnal Cabals. These are the
Men that can mode Religion, and dress it up to
humour the Times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Religion of late is very much dis|cours'd,
and after some sort crept into most
Mens Mouths; but least in practice of any thing
practicable. If they tell you that <HI>Asians</HI> are
<HI>Athenians,</HI> you are bound to believe them:
and that Turks are Christians, you cann't dis|prove
them, since <HI>France</HI> and the <HI>Port</HI> have been
Confederates. Nay there are some blear-ey'd
Romanists, under Pretext of Christianity, will
swear, that to worship Images is no Idolatry.
And some others of such voracious Appetites,
that they'll eat the Horse, and digest the Stir|rups.
And some amongst them (I speak what
I know) are never satisfied till glutted with
Spoil, which exposes every Man to the Lust of
his Adversary, whose Power is as equal to re|strain
his Will, as the Body to refrain from
Drought in a Fever.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>I make no doubt on't, we have Co|pernicans
amongst us, that can fancy the Earth,
as the Orbs, turn round; so rapid are the Minds
of some in this Adultrous Generation, to be
winding and turning, till He comes that will
overturn, and dissolve the Elements like Ice in
warm Water; so melt down the Creation with
one single Blast, and strike that dead that vio|lates
his Regal Commands: The all-glorious
beatifical Star of Heaven's high Tribunal is al|ready
risen in our earthly Horizon, which vir|tually
lifting up it self by magnetick Power,
lifts up our Souls also by a Magnetism of Divine
Sympathy, whereby we shall ascend above these
<PB N="21" REF="32">
muddy Cisterns of Earth and Clay, to blaze aloft
in those illustrious and most illuminated Mansi|ons
of Beatitude and Eternity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>I grant what you say: There are a
sort of Men that flatter themselves with Self-righteousness,
and shape out Condemnation as
a Reward to others; that can spy the Mote that
deforms their Brother's Eye, but the Beam that
shades their own is no Impediment. Thus some
gaze at their own Pageantry, and too frequent|ly
answer their own Petitions: that say to
themselves, All is well, when nothing's well but
what is ill: that live so near the Portalls of
Death, as if there were no Death in dying.
Such Men as these think the Sun shines Blessings
no where but in their Chimney-corners: that
build their Habitation upon a sandy Foundati|on:
that judg and pre-judg both Moralist and
Heathen, (that rather deserves their Pity and
Charity;) and censure all the World, when they
themselves cann't live without it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>What crazy Props such Men lean up|on,
that exchange their Profession for Profit. If
Christ be our Foundation, let's believe as Chri|stians;
not barely to honour the Appellation of
Christianity, but live the Life and Practice of
Christians, otherwise we build on a sandy Foun|dation,
that sinks beneath the Surface, or tum|bles
down in the Storm. We daily observe the
Earth a fix'd Body, yet it bears not the Hea|vens,
nor it self neither; because it hangs by
Poize of its own, and the Providence of God
supports it: For our blessed Saviour that made
the World, is the Support of the World; for
none less than he that made the World, had
<PB N="22" REF="33">
Power to redeem Man, and save the World.
This is the Water of Life that's drawn from
the inexhaustible Fountain of Christ our Re|deemer.
This is the true Physician of Life,
that blots out the dismal Characters of Death.
Thus whilst the formal Christian draws Streams
from the muddy Cisterns of the ambignous
World, his Devotion reaches no higher than
himself, and the gaudy Titles of Ambition and
Hypocrisy.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall I oblige <HI>Arnoldus</HI> to entertain us

<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every Day has a new Birth, but
Time and the World had but one Beginning.
The Night was made to shadow the Day, but
the Sun to light and illuminate the Universe&punc;

that stuck the Stars in this beautiful Order, be|fore
whose triumphant Throne the devout Peni|tent
prostrates his Devotion, and pours forth
his Orizons and sweet Adorations in the Pre|sence
of that great and ineffable Good, that
made the glittering spangled Orbs, and is him|self
the Light of the World; before whom
every Nation and Kingdom must bow or break;

<P>The Elements, nay the Heavens con|tain
him not, nor is he comprehended within
the circular Globe of the Spherical Orbs. These
luminous Bodies of Sun, Moon and Stars, were
<PB N="23" REF="33">
ordained by him to light the Creation: for he
that made them gave them a Being, and dignified
them also with prolifick Virtue, adapting them
Parents of Vegetation, Procreation, and Pro|longation
of Life, whereby to regulate and re|form
Times and Seasons; as also to distinguish
betwixt Summer and Winter. The greater
Light he made to govern the Day, but the Moon
he made to patrole the Night; and that they
have Influence upon secondary Causes, no Man
is so irrational, I hope, as to question it.</P>

<P>For my part I do not; pray pro|ceed.</P>

<P>Thus the Stars and Constellations
have Divine Order and Influence; and the Ce|lestial
Powers and Principalities, as Angels and
Arch-angels, Thrones and Vertues, have Do|minion
also over humane Frailties: And where
the Patriarchs and the Prophets are with the
Apostles and Evangelists, with the whole Quire
of Saints, Cherubims and Seraphims, perpetu|ally
singing Praises and Glory to him that sits on
the Throne, and rides triumphant on the Wings
of the Wind. O let the silent Deeps and the
ponderous Mountains, with every thing that has
Breath, praise the Lord! For the Earth is his,
and the Fulness thereof: by whose Wisdom the
World was made, and Time begot; and by
whose infinite Power the separated Elements
live still in Harmony; who form'd the Fetus of
Earth, and made the Firmament its Swadling|band:
and in the vast Circumference of Heaven
he hung up the glorious Creature the Sun,
whereby to illuminate and illustrate the World;
whose Centre nor Circumference contains him
<PB N="24" REF="34">
not; nor the Excellency of his Glory that su|perexcels
all Creatures and Creations; from
whom the deplorable Sons of Men wail for De|liverance
and Redemption from Sin.</P>
<P>And now let's contemplate the nocturnal
Muses. Sleep first presents us with an Emblem
of Death: yet is it the poor Man's Solace, tho
the rich Man's Terror: A Repose and Recreati|on
to the wearied Limbs, but a Disease of In|quietude
to the voracious Mind: the Body's
Requiem, and Death's Effigies. Now Death
is the desired Hope of him that truly conteM|plates
the State of Immortality: And as Mor|tality
is the End of Sorrow, so by Consequence
it's the Beginning of Joy: A Period of Misery,
but the Trophy of Victory: The Resurrecti|on
of Life, and the Bloomings of Eternity.
For as the barren Ground thirsts after Rain, so
does the Oppressed seek Deliverance in Death.</P>
<P>Great and good is our glorious Creator,
whose Divine Excellencies superexcel the Crea|tion;
whose infinite Wisdom display'd it self
before Time and the World had as yet a Begin|ning.
Pardon my Presumption, most sovereign
Power, when to prostrate my Humilities before
thy sacred Shrines, that with a holy Reverence
and divine Piety all my Devotions may be ac|ceptable
to thee. We are but finite, but Thou
art infinite: Infinite in Power, to create the
World; and infinite in Wisdom and Providence,
to uphold it. Thy Government is in Heaven,
yet thou rulest upon Earth; but thy Habitation
here is the Tabernacle in Man.</P>
<P>O sacred Divinest! direct us in thy Paths of
Wisdom, to lead us the ready way to thy self:
<PB N="25" REF="34">
for thou rewardest every Man answerable to his
Works, and our Works (as <HI>Paul</HI> saith) do cer|tainly
follow us; then will they as certainly be
an Orb to environ us; and because an Object
continually before us, we can neither evade nor
shake them off, whereby they'll delight or be
a Terror unto us. <HI>As the Tree falls, so it lies;
and in the Grave there is no Repentance:</HI> therefore
seek the Lord early in a Spirit of Meekness;
for the Meek are said to inherit the Earth,
whilst the Proud that exalts himself, shall be
abased. Thy powerful Arm has often reached
Deliverance, the Righteous therefore shall re|joice
in thy Salvation; and all that sollicit thy
Paths of Peace shall be found in their Duty as
by Wisdom directed; but Destruction as a Judg|ment
is prepared for the Scornful: Therefore
let the Pious rejoice in his Hope, for the End of
the Wicked shall be an Abomination.</P>
<P>Lord! when we contemplate our mortal
State below, and those invisible immortal Powers
above, blest for ever to behold the Glory of thy
Majesty; it brings us to consider the Beginnings
of Time, and to ruminate where we were
when the Foundations of the World were laid
and stretch'd out; and who but thy self (by
Infinite Power) fastened the Ends thereof, and
lifted up the Curtains of Heaven's glorious Ca|nopy,
and caused the Face of the Firmament to
shine! Who but thy admirable Arm could sepa|rate
Light from Darkness, the Sea from dry
Land, and confine them with Barrocades of
Rocks and Sand? Who made those stormy
Winds to blow, and those boisterous Hurricanes
(the Rage of the Almighty) so tempestuously
<PB N="26" REF="35">
to roar, and roll themselves on the Face of the
Deeps? O what Hand, except the Divinest,
could make Mortal immortal, and bring Salva|tion
from the Loins of <HI>Iesse!</HI> Can the Shades of
Darkness speak the Wonders of thy Praise, or
the Night discover the Eye-lids of the Morning,
that when the Sun prepares his Course like a
Giant, will the Clouds clap their Hands, and
the Stars and Constellations shout for Joy? But
the Dead shall arise, and Mortality shall be clo|thed
with an immortal Livery, that shall never
tarnish, nor never diminish, but survive and out|live
the Ides of Time, and flourish when Time
shall be no more.</P>
<P>Then let us consider our present State, the
Shortness of Time, the Vanity of Things, and
how light all our Services and best Performances
weigh in the Ballance. Let us also consider the
Morning-Star, the illustrious <HI>Aurora</HI> is rising
upon us, and then it will be a perpetual Day.
Let us imprint on our selves the Characters of
our Eminent Ancestors; but above all, the
lively Sufferings of our blessed Saviour on the
Cross, and no longer paddle in these Puddles of
Sin, nor stumble in the Face of the Sun at Noon|day:
for wounding our selves by Sin, makes our
Saviour bleed afresh. We have excellent Prece|dents,
that of <HI>David</HI> notwithstanding his Inte|grity,
and that other of <HI>Solomon,</HI> tho the Prince
of Wisdom; of <HI>Hezekiah</HI> too, tho a very good
King; of <HI>Iosiah</HI> and others; of <HI>Paul</HI> a Convert,
of <HI>Peter</HI> a devout Reluctant, of <HI>Iob</HI>'s Patience,
<HI>Moses</HI> his Meekness, <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Faith: all these
were Men, besides hundreds more in holy Writ)
now eminent Saints; whose Pieties like so ma|ny
<PB N="27" REF="35">
Trophies hang up aloft in the new <HI>Ierusa|lem,</HI>
to adorn that Beautiful and Divine Habi|tation,
where the Lamb is the Light, and where
no Darkness can approach, nor Night close the
Casements of their Eyes any more, nor the pale
Aspect of Death the second time seal the Inden|ture
of a profound Silence. Consider it seri|ously,
for Piety is good Policy; and a holy, de|vout
and penitent Life no Impediment to a ver|tuous
Christian: And so good Rest, <HI>Theophilus,</HI>
that sleeps in silence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Silent I am, but not asleep; nor do I
dream when I contemplate the everlasting Praise
of the great Creator. How quickly has the
Night dismantled her self of those shady Sables
that covered Day, and concealed the flaming
Steeds of the Sun, when advancing to approach
our Northern Horizon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come then, let us rise, and shake off
Security: for as Sleep is no solid Direction to
point out to us the Way to Heaven; so Death

<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our former Ancestors lap'd not them|selves
in Downy Quilts, but made the Earth
their common Reception: But this Age dege|nerates
from Potentates to Pedanticks; and car|nally
devote their Services to every idle and
voluptuous Fancy. Do we not see with what
Eagerness some Men pursue all dishonest Actions,
whilst some others under the Consideration of
Riches, hug a conceal'd Joy in their ill-got
Treasures? whereby they contrive the Calami|ty
of the Poor, and at the same time rejoice at
the Misery of the Orphan, whose Morsel they
<PB N="28" REF="36">
swallow down as greedily as they devour the
Widows Habitation? Thus some contrive Ca|lamity,
and sin by whole-sale, magnifying their
Ambitions more than Men, when at the same
time they dwindle into Morts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if Beginnings have Periods, as
certainly they have, the Poor will rise up in
Judgment against such; and a Jog of Conscience,
besides the Consequence of Blood, attend their
Door. Their Favourites and familiar Flatte|rers
then will dismiss themselves, and vanish
like a Mist, and the dark Night of Horror over|shadow
all their Enjoyments: Their delicate
and delectable Morsels will melt into Moon|shines,
and themselves transform'd into Dust
and Ashes. This is the Lot, and will be the Fate
of all those that pervert Blessings into profane
Impieties. But I forget my self, for the Sun
appears, and the Day will suddenly gain ground
upon us; let us arise and fit our selves for a so|litary
March.</P>

<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>We shall soon be ready, it's only dis|mounting
our Apartments to mount our Horses.
What shady Groves are those, and what wan|dring

Nay, what will you say to see the Church look

It's Madness rather than Manners to hear them
wrangle and jangle about Religion, when there's
nothing left on't but bare Opinion; which if

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, no better Entertainments in
the Spanish Court, than such rough Salutes as
Inquisitions and <HI>Stelletto</HI>'s! I should rather ap|prove,
<PB N="30" REF="37">
that Vertue in a Prince is the richest
Diadem in his Crown; and Clemency to his
Subjects (the vital part of his Kingdom) more
obliging than all the gilded Baits of Flattery.
Money, it's true, is the Sinew of War; and
Honours and Dignities gaudy Accomplishments.
What of all this? when all comes to all, Ho|nesty
is the best Policy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me tell you, <HI>Theophilus,</HI> Gold
Chains best become great Men; but not that
Gold makes Goodness, nor Dignity Greatness,
any otherwise, than a Badg of Honour makes a
Man truly honourable: nor is Honour more le|gitimate
than inherent Worth; both spring
from one Root originally, and live above the
Smiles or Frowns of Fortune. Nor can such a
Man be perverted that hates the nauciating
Scent of a Parasite, that disclaims against Pen|sioners
that pick his Pocket, and abominates
Sycophants that fawn and flatter, and seem to
adore the rising Sun; yet with Impatience longs
to see it set. Not but that no Sun shines with|out
some Cloud, nor any Court is kept without
some Flatterers, till that time comes (and I
hope is at hand) that Vertue shall naturally
flow from the Streams of Piety, (and not from
Imitation) which spontaneously spring from the
Celestial Fountains of pure Christianity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>When <HI>Democrasians</HI> dagger the Crown,
then the perplex'd Native stands a tiptoe (every
minute) expecting some fatal Event: and so it
is, when Insolency justles Justice, then the Ma|gistrate
suffers Affronts in his Legal Justiciary
Proceeds. Such Scorpions as these wound and
infect the Body Politick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="31" REF="37">
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>From thence I observe, whenever Pride
is most predominant, there of necessity a Nur|sery
of War is planted, that in time will murder
the Blessings of Peace. We have learn'd by
Experience, that Fulness of Bread (without a
Blessing) perverts into Wantonness, so into a
Curse, that by degrees grows up into such a
Vice, that murders all it meets with, and kills
without Care; it's a Vertue therefore to shun
its Acquaintance.</P>

<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come <HI>Arnoldus,</HI> let us enter this solitary
Grove, here we may dwell among Rocks; con|sort
with the Creation, and keep time with the
Pulse of the fluctuating Ocean. Here we may
refresh our Ears with the relishing Notes of tu|nable
Birds, and astonish our Eyes with the
beautiful Model of Heaven: Where whilst we
gaze on those glittering Orbs, our Hearts as in|spired

<P>A solitary Life I always approv'd of, to
trace the polite Sands, to sit down under the
Shades of Woods and Rocks, and accost the
Rivers and Rivulets for Diversion, (as now we
do) and trample on the beautiful Banks, and
florid Medows, beautified with Greens, that will
not only refresh our Senses with their redolent
Perfumes, but enamour us beyond express, when
to see their Banks bath'd by such Silver Streams.
Come and let's pitch our Tents in these de|lightful
Plains, where every shady Grove as an
<HI>Vmbrella,</HI> will shelter us from the scorching fiery
Beams of the Sun, till the Earth sends forth her
sweet <HI>Aroma</HI>'s; over which the burnish'd and
beautiful Firmament of Heaven surrounds all
the Earth (and the blessed Creation) with

Melody like Birds, and murmuring Streams; I
fancy it a kind of Counter-Paradise for Mortal
Content: And how sweet and sublime is that
Contemplation that surmounts Angels for Di|vine
Associates! Observe, <HI>Theophilus,</HI> that little
rowling Rivulet, where every Eye may evidence
Fish in those purling Streams courting the Sun,

<P>Such <HI>Furioso</HI>'s I must confess are of an

the Laws; that sit uneasy under Governments,

with any thing that's uppermost; nay, they
shall arraign themselves, if no Superior to con|tend

the great Acts of former famous Men, will live
upon Record on the Stage of the World, whilst
the World has a Being; more especially such
great Actions as drew Life from Vertue: Such
Heroes we have had (but asleep now) whose
Memories still blossom, and after Death smell
sweet in the Dust.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then? must we despair of our
selves, as poor silly Birds do that are seiz'd in

Fears, and refer them and us to the Grave
for Reconciliation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not ignorant that the Rape of a
Sword results in a SCar, and amputates some|times
to the loss of a Limb, lest peradventure
the whole Body be hurried into a Fever: For
the Sword you must know is Death's cold Har|binger,

Service done; for which they had for Hostage,
<HI>Newcastle, Carlisle</HI> and <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed:</HI>
But upon paying them one Moiety down, they
resigned their Hostage, and withdrew into <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
tendring the King to the English Com|missioners,
who at that time had no Instructions
concerning him, till they sent to the Parliament
to know their further Intentions, who ordered

<P>He desired to be removed to one of his
Southern Palaces, in order to which they re|moved
him to <HI>Holmby.</HI> But the Jest lay here,
the English without Instructions could not take
him, and the Scots by Instructions would not
take him: this was the critical
time when no body would have
him;<NOTE PLACE="marg">See <HI>Ludlow</HI>'s Reply to <HI>Hol|lingworth.</HI></NOTE> and the Reason the Scots
gave for it was this, That he had
made such Breaches in the Bowels of <HI>England,</HI>
they were unwilling to take him into the Bowels
of <HI>Scotland.</HI> This is the Truth on't, and this
is the Scots selling their King. But where's

to Heaven?</P>

it's thought the Mystery of Law will be made

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>By this I perceive some dig deep to hide
their Counsels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Deep or shallow, it's a Tiffany Plot; any
Man with half an Eye may easily see through
it: Who is it cries up Peace, only those Men
whom the Times court, and the Constitution
<PB N="41" REF="42">
flatters? such Men as these may cry up for
Peace, while others sollicit an every day's No|vel:
No, <HI>Theophilus,</HI> there's nothing pleasant,
every thing seems in a hurly burly; and <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Spain</HI> at Sword's Point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>O but then what becomes of our Force
in <HI>Flanders?</HI> and what Prospect have we of the
<HI>Sweeds</HI> Expedition?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Sweed</HI> you may read looks asquint
on the <HI>Dane,</HI> the <HI>Portugal</HI> in Trouble, the <HI>Ve|netian</HI>
unsafe, and the <HI>Turk</HI> infested with inte|stine
War. Poor <HI>Europe,</HI> who can but pity thee!
more especially our Native Country <HI>Albion,</HI>
where every Politician expects to be made a
Monarch; and where every ambitious Clown
aspires to the Eminency of a Crown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now for a Book and a Brook, to con|template,
and recreate; this rises to the Stan|dard
of the Philosophers Solitudes. Rocks and
Rivers with Hermetick Groves, shadowed with
Myrtles and purling Streams, will for ought I
know better answer our present Occasion, than
a Foreign Hope can insure us Accommodation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>These Elementary Bodies, the beautiful
Rags of Flesh and Blood, what present they but
moving Shadows, that vanish in a moment at
Death's Appearance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>And do not some Men undermine them|selves
by supporting themselves on the Crutch
of Mortality? But the Arm that shakes the
Foundation, cannot that Arm shelter us from
the Storm?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes sure, since he that made the World
gives it Nutrition, who by his Act of Provi|dence
makes Provision for its Continuation. Yet
<PB N="42" REF="43">
there's nothing that had a Beginning, but has
its Period, and in Conclusion melts into Invisi|bility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's certainly true, for the Wages of
Sin is Death; all Men therefore must die, so
must that proud Tyrant of <HI>France,</HI> whose Sins
above knee-deep have sunk him up almost to
the Chin: so that whoever comes within com|pass
of his Steerage, he splits the Vessel, or in|evitably
oversets her; exposing his Natives and
others to a malicious Fate: Therefore how diffi|cult
is it to sail betwixt <HI>Sylla</HI> and <HI>Charibdis?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And as difficult almost to weather the
Times at home; for whenever a State stands a
tiptoe, the common People are threatned Exiles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not be thought so rash to pre|anticipate
before trial; nor would I truckle to
uneven Tempers of Men and Times, by a su|pine
Complacency, so to be coaks'd out of my
Life by the sugared Temptation of Designers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unthinking Men whilst the Storm is yet
rising, rise before it, so fool away their Lives:
He that falls in with a discontented Family, pro|pounds
to build on another Man's Ruin. The
Divine Powers shake the Arm of Flesh; and
what is too difficult for God to do? He that
made the World, can throw it down and dash
it in pieces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes sure, and us too, if we stand within
distance (I mean in his way of Justice against
Impenitents.) O my Friend, let's remove fur|ther
off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Star must direct us? and whither
must we go?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="43" REF="43">
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Into the solitary Shades of <HI>Scotland;</HI> for
every Eye will trace us out here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! so unjust to our selves, to fly with|out
an Offence! so condemn our selves before
trial! when our own Innocency I should think
were enough not only to clear us, but also to
protect us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Time's sandy Glass slides swiftly into
Eternity; and so may some of these eminent
Contenders slip into their Graves. That Wind
blows high that makes our Fortunes stagger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor could Thunder shake the Courage
and Constancy of <HI>David</HI> to <HI>Ionathan:</HI> Here we
have for Precedent two of the Worthies in that
Age, the one no less than a King and a Pro|phet;
and the other no less than the Son of a
King. Come, let's stand the Charge, there's no
Man knows what a Day may bring forth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, I'm so prophetick to foresee a Stone
Doublet, or something worse; why then to
contribute such Advantages to Men of no Faith?
Nay, I wrong 'em not, to say faithless to them|selves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the other hand, who would harbour
or engender Fear, which lively prefigurates a
faint Repulse, that never got Honour by Inches?
so that I resolve against preparing for Flight,
and alike resolve not to think of Fear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such Resolutions will stem the Tide, and
struggle with Death; but who can withstand
the Torrent of Invaders, or stifle a Mutiny that
invades the Camp?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should forfeit both my Reason and
Discretion, to foresee Danger approach, and
run head-long into Ruin; want of Foresight
<PB N="44" REF="44">
(not to foresee) argues to me but a purblind
Sight: And that Resolution I always approv'd
of, that's best understood by a constant Courage;
the Morals of Equity justify a Cause, and the
Justness of a Cause puts a Period to doubts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Supreamest gives Wisdom, and Man
a Capacity to choose it; which, if he refuses,
it argues an irreverend Neglect, both of the
Donor and the Gift.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do we not see Nature commissioned from
the Divinest, to dress up and beautify this stu|pendous
Creation; and how Wisdom and Pro|vidence
give a Blessing to preserve it? And
do we act our Reason to throw both away,
Wisdom that made us, and Providence that pre|serves
us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's true, the Limit and Bound of Na|ture,
is by the sacred Decrees of Providence:
and Wisdom has no Limitation, because essen|tially
from the Creator himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Art imitates Nature, and Necessity is the
Mother of Invention; Science also invites to
Study and Practicks, but Theory gives the Pro|spect,
and Operation finishes the Project. From
whence it follows, that Arts are sold to In|genuities,
and the Reward of Labour and In|dustry
to Experience, and the Promulgation of
Health and Maintenance. What tho <HI>Caesar</HI> and
<HI>Pompey</HI> contend for an Empire? <HI>Alexander Mag|nus</HI>
bids fair for the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have waded to the Chin in the Practicks
of Experience; but never attempted Knee|deep
in the Rudiments of Politicks.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I have liv'd under various Dispen|sations
of Providence, by the Divine Power
<PB N="45" REF="44">
and protection of the Divinest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Nectar</HI> and <HI>Ambrosia</HI> have fill'd my Cup,
almost to an overflowing; while my Associates
were the Pious and the Penitent (but not the
Politick) with <HI>Apollo</HI> sometimes to bear a part,
with musical Instruments that never spoke Trea|son;
this is a Life that lives above the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>O the heavenly Raptures that flow
from Contemplation; they'r enough to raise the
Mind by divine Faith, and a holy Speculation, to
the very Suburbs and Portals of Paradise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<P>And such is Unity, for it's the Key
of Harmony; which if but touch'd by the di|vine
Finger of the great <HI>Iehovah,</HI> how quickly
the World is put in Tune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arnold.</SPEAKER>
<P>And quickly out of Tune, where Po|licy
is planted in the room of Piety. Now I
always thought Piety the best Policy, when
beautified with the Ornaments of true Christi|anity.
For since God himself has blest Man
with Reason, and to his Rationality added in|tellectual
Understanding, let us act above Sense,
for that enslaves us; and once enslav'd, we're
captivated with Fears.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were I a wise Expositor, I should inter|pret
this Sentiment by the rule of Travel.</P>
</SP>

<SP>

<P>No Man (than your Self) knows it
better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>If so, you must arm your self for Ang|ling
Encounters; for I best approve of a reso|lute
Combitant, whose Conduct and Courage
equally strive against all vicissitude of Fortune;
and smiles when at the precipice of Danger.
Such a Man bears the triumphant Standard of
Constancy in all Difficulties, and doubtful Un|certainties?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are Lectures to be read in Features?</P>

<SPEAKER>Theoph.</SPEAKER>
<L>Why now I'm answer'd, Doubts can have an end;</L>
<L>And so have mine, since lodg'd in such a Friend</L>
<L>To Nature, human Learning, Sense and Reason;</L>
<L>Compounds of purest Peace; no Plot, nor Treason</L>
<L>Harbours in that calm Breast, where Art and Science</L>
<L>Bud up like Twins, and bid a bold Defiance</L>
<L>T' Ignorance and Prophaneness: let thy Lot</L>
<L>Be what it will, and see if mine be not</L>

<SP>

<P>This looks somewhat like a Foreign Do|ctrine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>However you'l find it an innate Principle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>If so, then we run but one single Risque;
which of necessity will incorporate us in one sin|gle
Adventurer: in order thereto, let us first dis|patch
<HI>Agrippa,</HI> whose Countermarch will very
much advance our Progress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's well consider'd, pray let it be so;
that without interruption we may ramble all
<HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the studious Art of Angling, must
not we make that our employment?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes sure, but how must we accommodate
our selves with Rods, and other convenient
Manuals and Instruments, whereby to pursue
this mysterious Art?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Trouble not your self with that little
Affair; Here, <HI>Agrippa,</HI> take you these Letters,
and sweeten your Rhetorick with returns of
<PB N="48" REF="46">
<HI>Arnoldus,</HI> so oft as enquired for by my dear
<HI>Constantia.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Agrip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can the Tides forget their natural
Course? I'le court Sun and Moon to sprinkle
the Tracts with propitious Beams, to return me
prosperous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>But when you approach those harmoni|ous
Ports where <HI>Constantia</HI> dwells, be well ad|vis'd
what you say or express; let not one Word
slip that may cause a Tear; for if one Star
falls, all the Heavens lowre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>And remember me (honest <HI>Agrippa</HI>) to
the Vertuoso's in <HI>Nottingham;</HI> together with the
generous Society of Anglers, that traverse the
fragrant Banks of those silver silent and mur|muring
Streams of the famous <HI>Trent.</HI></P>
</SP>

<P>Near whose cultivated Shores, and florid

<SPEAKER>Agrip.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'le observe your Punctims, and pay

<P>Do so.</P>

<SPEAKER>Agrip.</SPEAKER>
<P>Heavens influence your Designs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now he is gone (nor will he be long in
going) in the mean time let us contemplate the
beauteous Creation, and retire to those solitary
Rocks to defend us from the radient and re|fulgent
Beams of the Sun, that direct their
Strokes upon us; such Retirements will mode|rate
Extreams: afterwards we may stretch our
Limbs to encounter our Recreation, and sport
our selves with the princely Trout, in the flou|rishing
<PB N="49" REF="46">
Rivers and Rivulets in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which
probably may contribute as much Satisfaction,
as any other Rivers in the Promontories of great
<HI>Britain,</HI> if dextrously examined, and industri|ously
managed with Patience, and other Re|quisites,
sutable and agreeable to the Methods
of Art.</P>
<P>We may also in our Progress, as we travel
the Country, take a Survey of their Towns,
Forts and Fortresses; the like we may do of
their Cities, Castles and Ciradels; with their
Rivers, Rivulets, and solitary Loughs; which
will furnish us with Fish enough, provided we
can furnish our selves with Baits. But to furnish
every Angler with a new Bait, was the studi|ous
Invention of <HI>Isaac Walton,</HI> Author (as you
may read) of the <HI>Compleat Angler,</HI> who indu|striously
has taken care to provide a good Cook,
(supposing his Wife had a Finger in the Py)
which will necessarily be wanting in our Nor|thern
Expedition; where the Fry are numerous,
(nay numberless almost) in some of those Rapid
and Trembling Streams; from whence the Ar|tificial
Fly (if that Exercise be well understood)
will contribute as much as any thing, to court
them ashore, and sweeten our Recreation. But
I speak more peculiarly to ingenious Artists,
not to those flegmetick Fellows indigent of
Art; such only I allot an accidental Fate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Methinks I grow impatient to attempt
these silver Streams with our harmless Ar|tillery;
here needs no Auxiliary force to guard
our Approaches, when only to trample these
delicious, pleasant and fragrant Banks, enameled
with Flowers, and green Coverings, where
<PB N="50" REF="47">
every chrystal purling Stream is overshadowed
with a stately Fir-tree, or some spreading Sy|comore;
through which <HI>Zephyrus</HI> inspires a
softned breath of Air to curl the Surface of the
milder Streams, and where the glittering Shores
shine like <HI>Peru,</HI> or the golden Sands of the ad|mired
<HI>Tagus,</HI> as if purposely erected for a
Tomb or Sepulchre, therein to inter the gene|rous
Trout; which is the Anglers Trophies,
and the ultimate Period of Art. Reach me that
Rod, <HI>Arnoldus,</HI> and furnish me with Tackle to
try my Fortune. Are these Flies proper, and
sutable to the Season? Is the Line tapred, and
the Rod rush-grown? Every thing answers to
promise Success, and now have amongst them;
for I resolve beyond dispute to approve my
self an Angler, or shame the Art.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>An Angler; an Allegator rather, to rush
so rudely upon a River, and forget your Ru|diments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>My passionate Zeal hurried on by Ava|rice,
confirm'd the difficulty of catching Fish,
no more, than a cast of my Fly to summon them
ashore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>That wou'd excuse your over-forward|ness,
to put a force upon your Exercise; the
Anglers Direction and the Mediums of Art,
are the Pole-Star you must steer by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do well to reckon up my Errors, and
lay down Rudiments to oblige me to reform: all
that I sollicite, is to be Master of my Exercise;
that Theory and Practice be made legible and
intelligible; Nature then will demonstrate her
self obvious to the Artist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="51" REF="47">
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have hit the Mark, it's true what
you say: Art at the best is but Nature's Imita|tion;
Instructions made legible, gratify the In|genious,
whilest the Ignorant read but Lectures
in their ABC.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I need not despair; however as
I'am solicitous after the Secrets of the Art, di|rect
me how to flourish a Fly in a torpid deep
and melancholy Water; such as this is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Stand close be sure, that's your first Cau|tion;
and appear least in sight, that's your se|cond
Direction; and dibble lightly on the Sur|face
of the Water, that's your third and final
Instruction: now order and manage the Affair
as well as you can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I will; and fancy that a City is more
than half conquered, where Resolution has got
footing in the Besiegers Camp.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>From your Inference, I must conclude,
that confident <HI>Theophilus</HI> will approve himself
an Artist, because he's so forward in the Art of
Angling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'le observe the Anglers Axioms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you must, if you intend to be an Ar|tist;
but how will you flourish a Fly in that so|litary
Water, whereby to compleat your self
Lord of your own Exercise? consider it seri|ously.
In the next place, you must mind the
Season of the Year. Small Rains, fair Wea|ther,
and intermittent Sun-shine, all these contri|bute
to your Entertainment; but Snow-broth,
and Storms, stand in opposition to your Recre|ation.
You must also observe, the Wrack of
Clouds, and the hovering Winds that curl the
Streams; these Circumstances judicially obser|ved,
<PB N="52" REF="48">
an ordinary Artist may kill a Trout, pro|vided
he purdue himself at a reasonable distance.
But what must be done when the Air is un|disturbed,
nor the least breath of Wind to fan
the Sholes? Can you then kill a Fish to re|compence
your Labour, and sweeten your
Toil? Come, lend me your Rod, and I'le ha|zard
my Skill to puzzle the Art, or lay a Trout
in your Lap.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's as much as to say, you will give
me Handsel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I do but little, if I do not do that.
Observe that Bush, whose slender Branches
wantonly dangle, sporting themselves on the
Cusp of the Water: there's no Stream you may
observe, nor any thing of Motion, nor the least
breath of Air to invade the Calms. Put case I
kill a Trout from that silent Surface, what will
you think on't?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'le think you an Artist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>When?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>When I see your success.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have amongst them then&mdash;: Now
there's what I promised you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I'le promise you, you are a Man of
your Word.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I seldom use to be less.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I'le never desire to be more. But
one thing I observe, and that's very remarkable:
why so circumspect in making your Approach|es,
when accosting the River, as an Engineer
approaches a Fortification?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's Reason for that I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then there's Reason you resolve me
what I shall do, since Trouts are so difficult to
deal with.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="53" REF="48">
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will tell me more (I question not)
when you come to examine them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>And that won't be long if I have my li|king.
But what an admirable Fish is the Trout
for Shape, Beauty and Proportion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such is the Char; next to him the Umbar.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>And are they of as much Agility of Bo|dy?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>In every respect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of necessity then they must be excellent
Companions to consort with the Angler, whiles
the Miser and Avaricious hugs his Bags, the
Epicure his luxurious voracious Appetite, and
the wretched and covetous Angler his Paunch
and Pannier. Let Art, Industry and Experience
gratify the Artist. But as Fortune favours you
in your second Adventure, such are my re|solves
to magnify the Art.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do well I perceive, to do nothing
rashly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you do it better, by doing on't ad|visedly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then have at all; and I think I have
him, look how he leaps and struggles for Life;
but this prognosticks a Sign of Death: for
when the Swan sings his own Funeral-Epi|taph,
which of the Family of Birds join in
Consort with him? so when the Trout dances
Coranto's to the Angler; what but the Line
rings his Funeral Passing-peal? Now see how he
lies gasping for Breath, though every Breath
of Air is as bad as Opium; and laments his Mis|fortune
to be so unfortunate, because not to
live out half his Time; where every Cheque of
the Line challengeth Death, and sends him a
<PB N="54" REF="49">
Summons to prepare for the Pannier. So that
you see he is no sooner deprived of natural
Strength, but submits himself to the fatal doom
of the Angler, who assures him no better Quar|ter
than Death. Are not these terrible Argu|ments
to terrify the Fish out of his Element?
who whilest he endeavours to evade the Angler,
falls foul upon the Art with equal Hazard; and
designing Flight, pursues the Pursuer: so strug|gles
with the Artist to cheat his Appetite, by
proffering his Life for a silly Fly. By this you
may see it's not difficult to court him, when
with little difficulty he comes to Hand, nay to
his Grave, meerly for a mouthful; for this sim|ple
Novelty cost him his Life. And what was
it think you? only a Fly of another Figure,
and of a different Complexion; the one Arti|ficial,
but this was Natural, and there he lies
naturally devoted yours, not daring to petition
his Judg's Reprieve. Where note, for your
encouragement, I present you with my Con|quest;
and dedicate both my Practice and Ex|perience
to your self, purposing perhaps a far|ther
Examination. For since to find Fish so
prodigal as to meet me half way, what cause
have I to doubt of carrying them to their Jour|ney's
end?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's lucky Handsel for a young Be|ginner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you are that young Beginner; pray
accept of Handsel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thanks, <HI>Arnoldus,</HI> if Thanks be Argu|ment
good enough to retaliate your Bounty.
But what must we think of those hovering
Clouds?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="55" REF="49">
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think they'l bring us Summons of
Night, otherways I am loth to relinquish these
pleasant Streams, that divert the Angler with
such profitable Entertainments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>If the Night approach, it's time to with|draw;
but to withdraw from such sweet Di|version
goes against the Grain. <HI>Eden,</HI> farewel.
Nay I'le repeat it twice; Farewel, <HI>Eden.</HI>
With what reluctancy do I relinquish thy Smi|ling
Fords, though to solace my self in the For|tress
of <HI>Carlisle.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are shrewdly hurt. Will Refresh|ment
incommode you after the Toils of Re|creation?
and your observation of this late
Encounter invalidate the Art? Ingenuously tell
me, what your Observation directs to?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>This I observ'd worthy my Observation,
that it was a Field fairly fought, but I cannot
say without loss of Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I declare it a Conquest of an easy
Purchase, where Arms and Artillery (the Rod
excepted) amounts not to Sixpence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was it six Shillings, what a Purchase is that
to experience Art, and tantalize Fish? What's the
single hazard of a Hook and Line, (a valuable
considerable Loss indeed) to lose the Value of
Two pence, to purchase a Fish worth Ten pence?
Pray what is it more than earnesting the River
with a Hook and Line, to stem the Adventure?
which I value not a Rush, was every Hair a Thread
of Gold, and the barbed Hook of superfine Silver;
I'd expose the Worth on't for the Fin of a Fish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Resolution surmounts the Adventure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides all this: here's another Observa|tion,
well worthy our own and the Angler's con|sideration;
<PB N="56" REF="50">
and that is, our Labour and Travel:
it's no more than a Walk to trample the deli|ciated
and cultivated Fields, on the fragrant
Banks that bridle the meandring Streams. O
who would not solicite Patience to crown such
charming Rewards, intail'd upon Anglers, in
their solitary Recreations? Instruct me, dear
<HI>Arnoldus,</HI> in this liberal Art, and ingenuously
tell me how you took these Trouts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>With nothing, upon Reputation, but a
natural Fly, which I suddenly snatch'd from
that slender Twig: For if you remember my
turning to that Bush, I mean that Hawthorn
that flourishes behind you; there it was I dis|covered
some Insects, which properly to con|sult,
are as truculent as Death, more especially
in the Ides of <HI>April</HI> and <HI>May.</HI> It was only with
Dracks that I kill'd these Trouts; nor is there
any Bait that excels it at the Tail of a Bush, or
the Brow of a Bank, provided always you ap|pear
least in sight; dibble but lightly on the
Surface of the Calms, you infallibly raise him;
and the better to secure him, stand but close,
and you certainly kill him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>This plain Discovery speaks both Theory
and Practice. Such Instructions as these (ex|cept
to an indigent Artist) will indisputably
compleat him an Angler in an instant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come then, if you please, let us lap up
our Lines, and trace these pleasant Fields to the
Town of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> where we may refresh our
selves with the Country Curiosities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it very good and wholsome Ad|vice,
to comply with your Motion for a <HI>Modicum:</HI>
For when the Water with Exercise extimulates
<PB N="57" REF="50">
our Stomachs, I fancy Diet will relish better
than Discourse; and when we have closed-up
the Orifice of our Appetites, clean Linen I
fancy will be very acceptable. The for the
Morning-Watch, trust to my Diligence, for I'll
rise with the Sun, or it may be before Day, to be
in a readiness to survey this ancient City, Ci|tadel,
Castle, Cathedral, Ports, Vanports, Cur|tains,
Counterscarps, Bastions, Redoubts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
of all which I purpose a brief Description, and
that you may expect before our Departure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You direct good Measures; but let me
first advise you to observe Access, Situation and
Strength, the Complement and Resolution of
their Armed Men; their Arms also, Ammunition
and Artillery; what stock of Provisions is stored
in their Providors; and whether Nature or Art
challenges the Superiority in her Fortifications.
This is part of the Task you impose upon your
self; and by Noon be in readiness for our De|parture;
about which time (if I calculate right)
the Tide will commode us for our Northern
Passage over the trembling tottering Sands. In
the mean time, let not the Night nor our Sleep
invade us, nor our Watchings slide into wanton
Embracements: For the Watchman of the
Night will declare against such, and a Serpent
conceal'd in the Secrets of Conscience, shall
gnaw and devour our Habitations with our
selves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Vainly and profusely to lavish Time, we
but flatter our selves with sordid Delusions, that
vanish if but touch'd by the cold icy Finger of
Death. How in a trice Honours become fugi|tive
before us; and Mortality in a moment in|corporates
<PB N="58" REF="51">
with the Grave; Tissues and Orris
Hangings become a Prey to the Moth; and
polish'd Pavements of Jasper, with those others
of Marble, how quickly Time translates them
into Tombstones: Nay, those Delicacies and
Viands that surprized the Palat, are by this
also converted into nauseous Excrements. So
that upon the whole, this Elementary Compo|sition
in conclusion results in Dust and Ashes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's very true: for did Man but consider
the Instability of Transitory Enjoyments, he
might read himself more miserable in living
than dying; but there is a State (tho unknown
to the Ignorant) that is too great and glorious
for Mortals to purchase: but Christ hath al|ready
done that for inglorious Man, whose
longest Progress of Life on the Stage of this
World, is no more than a Dream to the length
of Eternity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now the fair Star <HI>Aurora</HI> springs upon
us, I must be stirring, <HI>Arnoldus;</HI> you know I
have set my self a Task to survey this City
and Fortress of <HI>Carlisle,</HI> which I purpose to
describe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>That will be time enough about Noon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>And it may be I can do it now as well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come then, let us have it; I see you're
in haste.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Carlisle,</HI> I have considered it but a little
City, a little Observation therefore shall serve
to describe it. However, it's a Fortification
(that's true) tho it stands in a Nook, or more
properly to call it a Corner of <HI>England,</HI> whose
Foundations are Rocky, and surrounded with a
Stone Wall. At the South Entrance you may
<PB N="59" REF="51">
observe a small Citadel fronted with Stone, and
such are the Houses of the same Material; nor
are they much elevated into the Air, where the
Battlements are seen above the Houses, which
argues the Wall a serviceable Defence. In the
midst of the Market-place they parade their
Guards: And at the North-west End of the
City stands their Castle (strong and formidable)
upon whose bulky Battlements several Pieces of
Cannon are planted, to scatter Fury in every
Quarter. There is also a Cathedral situated
South from the Bastions of the Castle, worthy
any Man's Description, were it not so torn to
Tatters that there's little to describe, which only
serves now as a Monument to gaze at, because
impoverish'd by the strokes of Time. But the
Ports, and sally Ports of this Northern Fortress
are girt about with Rocky Stone; and the Wash
of <HI>Eden</HI> bathe some of her Sconces; that River
I mean where <HI>Arnoldus</HI> fish'd when he slew the
Trouts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's very true, the River <HI>Eden</HI> floats near
the Skirts, and the Fortifications of <HI>Carlisle.</HI>
But then you must consider there's another Ri|ver,
commonly known by the Name of <HI>Annon,</HI>
(of a more rapid Motion, and more resolute
Streams) which issues from the famous Top of
<HI>Erricsteen,</HI> not far from as famous a Mountain
called <HI>Tintaw.</HI> This <HI>Annon</HI> glides along the
Southern Marshes of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which afterwards
espouseth with the Ocean Westward, and gives
Name to a Dale, commonly called <HI>Annon's Dale.</HI>
But there's another River the Natives call <HI>Ask,</HI>
which juts just upon <HI>Annon,</HI> on the Scotish Pro|montories,
so tumbles into the Sea at N. Nor-West,
<PB N="60" REF="52">
as near as I can guess at the quaking
Sands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray give us that Relation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember on a time as I travelled these
Parts, to Admiration I saw two thousand Horse,
all advance in Divisions over those silly Shores,
which so prest and deprest the tottering Sur|face,
that not till then, nor before, I had ever
seen Sands shap'd into Vallies, then again into
Mountains; nay, such prodigious over-grown
Mountains as almost amaz'd me: because when
to behold from such palpable Levels, Moun|tains
as it were rais'd up in a moment; and in
the twinkling of an Eye, all melted into Vallies.
And the nearer the Bodies approached one ano|ther,
the farther they seemed to be asunder.
So that upon the matter the Advance of this
Brigade, was little more than to make new
Hills, and depress and sink them again into
Dales. So that looking behind me when dis|charging
the Fords, there was nothing remain|ing
but Sea and Sand, chequer'd as it were <HI>parte
perpale.</HI> This is the first of our Northern
Wonders, and the Rarity is almost beyond Be|lief,
were it not so commonly experienced by
almost every Traveller that travels these Nor|thern
remote Parts: otherwise it might render
me ridiculous to report it, and look too fabu|lous
to gain a Reputation. But he that has be|held
this admirable Prospect will credit my
Relation, whilst the more ignorant and preju|dicate
suspend their Censures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>And must we adventure to attempt these
tottering Sands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, indisputably we must.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="61" REF="52">
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>In my Opinion then it's requisite we sum|mons
a Guide.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>That's well considered, for there's no
passing without one.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Servus.</SPEAKER>
<P>Wha's there?</P>

<P>I know not what Ground it is, nor what
to call it; but this I know, that I'm glad we
<PB N="62" REF="53">
can welcome our selves on this side Danger.
What think you, <HI>Arnoldus,</HI> have not we made
an eminent Exchange, to truck a Southern Rose
for a Northern Thistle? Farewel old <HI>England,</HI>
I shall venerate thy Memory, and thy fertile
Medows, and never forget thy florid Fields that
glut the Sithe, nor thy fragrant Gardens that
perfume the Air.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And welcome <HI>Scotland,</HI> I say; for this
Night I purpose to lodg in <HI>Dumfreez;</HI> but who
must carry our Impliments and our Fish?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us catch 'em first, and then consider
their Portage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's but little difficult to do, where
every Field is accommodated with Rivulets, and
every Rivulet furnished with Trouts, as we tra|vel
along this mountainous Coast of <HI>Galloway:</HI>
Look but before you, and view those Ports;
such are the Entrances into the Decays of
<HI>Dumfreez,</HI> whose Situation and Buildings be|speak
it spacious, and a Town that will furnish
us with Fish and Flesh; where we may stay till
to Morrow, and solace our selves with her flou|rishing
Streams; whose lofty Banks barrocade
the beautiful <HI>Pontus Arnotus,</HI> a pleasant portable
River below the Situation of the Town (un|plundered
of Exercise) that will recreate and
recruit us with Fish enough, if the Season but
serve to experiment the Art.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I approve very well of your Motion, but
a <HI>Modicum</HI> first will be very seasonable. Let us
summons the Cook to know what he's got in the
Kitchin; and give Charge to the Chamber-Maid
(if there be such a thing in <HI>Scotland</HI>) to
take care that the Windows be deck'd and
<PB N="63" REF="53">
adorn'd with Flowers, whilst the Boards and
Floors are strewed with Greens: For I'll exa|mine
every Thread in our Beds, to see if they
be cleanly wash'd, and throughly dried, the
better to accommodate us in our Northern Ex|pedition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do so, and I resolve in the Morning to
examine your Breviate of the various Particu|lars
of this Night's Entertainment, how you
approv'd of your Lodging, with the memorable
Apprehensions of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>Scotland.</HI> The
Sauce also, you must tell how that savoured;
and the rest of your Delicates, how they di|gested;
together with your Linen, how rich|ly
perfumed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were not Complaint a ridiculous Orator,
I would tell you the Mutton was small, but good;
but Cookery I perswade my self never worse
contriv'd: And the Linen was sweet, and
clean enough, of a modest Complexion, but
not Lavender-proof: Then for their Pewter
(the like was never seen) it was tarnish'd with
nothing but a Face of Lead. The Beds I con|fess
were soft enough, and if I don't mistake
my self, short enough: Yet every Angler may
without difficulty resolve how sweetly Rest re|lishes
after Recreation; and how grateful
Solace seems after good Success. Shall we spread
the Water this Morning with our angling Artil|lery,
and examine the Fords before we feast our
selves? Resolve this Morning's Exercise my Be|nevolence,
only stand by and furnish me with
Directions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Motion inclines me to promote the
Adventure, and the rather because to introduct
<PB N="64" REF="54">
you into the Anglers Society. Hold forth your
Hand and grasp this Rod, take also this Box,
and this dubbing Bag of Flies, and select a
Choice. The Complextion of the Water must
also be considered; and Depths and Shallows
are necessary Observations. But above all, mind
carefully the Clifts of those craggy Rocks, from
whence you must expect the head of your
Game, if you angle for Trout. And be cir|cumspect
and cautious when and how you strike,
lest peradventure Passion provoke your Discre|tion,
so indanger the loss of what you labour
for.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are Soveraign Admonitions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mind therefore your Directions, and
fish like an Artist; for here if your Line but
reach the Water, you raise a Trout, or it may
be a Salmon. Where note, if you be indigent
of this generous Art, and unskilful to manage
so eminent an Encounter; perchance you'l sa|crifice
your Labours to loss, so in conclusion
lose your Reputation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be mindful of that.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then direct your Eye to those bubbling
Streams, at whose murmuring Descents are
most profound Deeps. But then again there's
Cataracts, and falls of Water; from whose fair
Invitations neither doubt nor despair of Incom|parable
Entertainments. That's the <HI>Sirenes</HI> Seat
of Trophies, where Trouts tumble up and
down for Diversion: don't you see them pick,
and cast themselves on the Surface of the
Streams, amongst those knotty stumpy Rocks,
almost drown'd in Water? Lay but your Line
in at the tail of that Stream, where it's sheltred
<PB N="65" REF="54">
with craggy rocky Stones, and manage your
Game with Art and Discretion, I'le uphold
you sport enough; but be circumspect (be sure)
and look well to your Line, lest peradventure
your Tackle be torn to pieces.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubt not of my Care and Circumspe|ction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then take your Lot, and cast in your
Line; and flourish your Fly, for it's dub'd with
Bears Hair; and the Point of your Hook, it's so
snug and so sharp, that, as it ought, it must al|ways
hang downward. Moreover, it's propor|tioned
of an excellent Compass, wing'd also
with the dapple Feather of a Teal; a dange|rous
Novel to invite a desperate Fish; and su|table
to the Day and Season, in regard it's
bright.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why thus to capitulate? let us in a|mongst
them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Two words to a Bargain; be better
advised.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's past that now, and I'm past my
Senses, to feel such Trepidations on a sudden
invade me; What's the matter with me that
I'm thus out of Order?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I perceive you disordred, but not much
deliciated.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I were, it's folly to complain, when
past all hope to expect redress.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>How know you that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know you won't tell me what it is that
tugs thus.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be a Trout; or it may be a Sal|mon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="66" REF="55">
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or it may be both, for ought I know;
for it's almost impossible that one single Fish
should raise the Water to such Eruptions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And impossible for you (I perceive) to
reclaim him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do but resolve me what it is, and then
I'le resolve my self what to do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Make your own choice, what would you
have it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would have it a Fish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it is; and it may be a Fish of the
largest size: therefore look well about you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I may look which way I will, and despair
at last; what makes the Water swell with
Ebullitions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing I suppose but a change of Ele|ments,
the Fish has no mind to come a Shore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I have as little inclination to go to
fetch him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then were your Hazards equal; and
hitherto as I apprehend, you have much the
Odds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Odd or Even, I know not how to ma|nage
him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Would you put a force upon <HI>Neptune,</HI>
to compel his Subjects a Shore?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had I Skill enough, I would certainly do
it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I perceive; but you'r almost now at a
stand; Pull.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the other hand he strives to pull all
in pieces; which he will certainly do, if I do
not reclaim him. But where is he now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gone to the bottom, it may be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="67" REF="55">
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>And it may be I begin to smell the Plot;
he courts the Deeps for Self-security.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you fancy the Streams won't pro|tect
him; because there's no Plot in them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Plots for the most part you know lie
deepest; so he sinks to the Bottom for Self-pre|servation,
and creeps to Death as if of old
Acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rash Results reap Repentance: mistake
not your self by dooming his Death; he's but
slipt to the Bottom to recruit himself, and in|denture
with Stones to oblige their Protection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What must we have now another Vaga|ry?
Is my Scaly Companion surrounded and
compounded of nothing but Frolicks? which
for ought I know may cost him his Life, if he is
not mindful to look to his Hitts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you must be advised to look well to
yours; for he'l not come a Shore to beg his
Life. Stand fast therefore, and call to mind
your former Rudiments; for trust me I shall
give you no other Supply than some friendly
Admonishments to reconcile you together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, no Directions; nor any farther
Instructions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>If two to one be odds at Football, and
against the Rules and Law of fair Play, the
very Thoughts on't would make me blush, and
appear shamefac'd, if but to think two An|glers
should at once consult together to en|counter
one Fish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I'le fight him my self, and run my
own Destiny. See where he comes tumbling and
tossing, and volting himself in the stiffest
Streams. Can no Element contain his active
<PB N="68" REF="56">
Violence? Will he twist his Tail to cut my Line
for an Experiment? But this kind of cunning
may perchance defeat him; he may prick his
Chaps, and yet miss my Bait.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you may miss him, that won't stand
upon a Trifle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Trifle did you say? I'le trifle him no
longer. Ha Boys! he's gone again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppose he's gone where you can't come
at him; and that's to the Bottom for another
Insurrection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it appears, for he's invisible in a Mo|ment.
This is a kind of <HI>Hocus pocus:</HI> Surely I
fancy he has out liv'd his Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Flatter not your self with that fly-blown
Opinion; for I'm apt to perswade my self he'l
live beyond the Art of your Exercise; this I
know and perceive by his working, that if you
work not wisely, he'l work a Reprieve.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then i'le work with him, and trifle him
a Shore, to examine the Point, and exchange
of Elements. I see he's convulst by fluttering
his Fins; and I'm sure he's half dead by rig|ling
his Tail; nay, more than that, he lies still
without Motion: And are not all these mortal
Signs of Submission?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And if he submits, he dies without Re|demption:
and Death you know is a total Sub|mission.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'le kill this Fish, or forfeit my Reputa|tion.</P>

<SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I am pretty near them, was it not
that one or two Stratagems strangely amuse
me; the one of them is the casting himself on
the Surface, as if designing thereby to cut my
Line; and the other his fastning himself in the
Bottom, thinking, as I apprehend, to tear all
in pieces; which if he do, I lose my Reputa|tion:
besides I grow weary, and would fain

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what have you got?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have got nothing but the Foot-steps of
Folly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And Nothing out of Nothing is Folly in
the abstract; was not I Prophetick?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>An Oracle too true to confirm my Loss;
for what have I left? nothing but Folly, to la|ment
and condole this fatal Conclusion: to be
rob'd by a Fish that I reckoned my Reward; Is
not this Felony, to steal my Tackle, and ruin
an Angler? but he's mark'd for my own, and
let whose will take him, I'le challenge an Inte|rest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's very pleasant; when another has
catch'd him, you'l put in your Claim.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I will, where-e're I find him; for his
Marks I am sure will certainly betray him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="70" REF="57">
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>As if he wore your Livery to no other
purpose than to describe his Servitude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>So he does; for my Hook I am sure
hangs still in his Chaps, and part of my Line
is entailed to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought all along what it would come
to, for I knew well enough there was nothing
wanting but the exercise of Patience to kill this
Fish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What would you have done had it been
your Case?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would not have handled my Play-fel|low
so rudely.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! you rather laugh at me, than
pity my Loss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I pity the Fish to feed upon such sharp
Commons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Peradventure the Hook may go near to
choak him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>That it will never do, nor hardly check
him upon a fresh Entertainment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so; will the Hook remain in his
Chaps without Detriment to the Fish?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some small Season it may remain; but
Time and Action soon discharges it. For if
when to consider his frequent Motion, his con|tinual
gliding and glancing against Stones,
it loosens the part without Detriment to the
Fish, so that the Hook of it self leisurely drops
off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>How comes this to pass? it's incredibly
strange.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet not so strange as true that you have
lost a Line, as compleat a Line as Art could
proportion: it's well you kept your Rod, for
<PB N="71" REF="57">
i'le assure you it's exactly taper'd; and as
streight and plient as ever flourish'd a Fly to fa|cilitate
Death by D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">xterity. But this artificial
Novel you lost but now, gives no more satis|faction
to a voracious Appetite, than a Witch's
Banquet; or the unlimited Desires of a wretch|ed
Usurer, who never desists the pursuit of
Riches, till tantaliz'd, like your Game, to Death
with a Trifle.</P>
<P>And now <HI>Theophilus,</HI> I must reprove your Pre|cipitancy,
because a great Error in young Ang|lers.
Patience must be moderated to promote
the Art, and Time procrastinated to pro|claim
the Angler an Artist. These Precepts I
have laid down oftner than once, always pro|vided
your Swim be clear, your Line long, and
strong enough; then shall you see the Fruits of
your Labour, and the Fish himself act the part
of a Felon, that puts a Knife to his own
Throat, wherewith he secretly murders him|self:
and that this Desperado had certainly
done, upon exchange of Elements, so become his
own Executioner; who beyond dispute had
struggled to strangle himself; which without dif|ficulty
is easily and the more expeditiously done,
by frequently but cautiously exposing him to
Air; for that suffocates his Vitals, whereby he
necessarily falls under very fatal Cons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">quents.
And how little a thing blots out the Character
of Life, every one knows, that knows Air is as
Opium to force a sleepy Pulse; that deprives of
Motion, and makes passage for Death.</P>
<P>Be mindful therefore to observe Directions
in handling and managing your Rod and Line,
and cautiously keeping your self out of sight:
<PB N="72" REF="58">
all which Precautions are requisite Accomplish|ments,
which of necessity ought to be under|stood
by every ingenious Angler. And so is
that secret Art of Striking, which ought never
at any time to be used with Violence; be|cause
with a moderate Touch, and a slender
proportion of Strength, the Artist for the most
part has best Success.</P>
<P>Another Caution you must take along with
you; and that is, when you observe your Game
begins to make an out; that is, when he
bolts, or when he launcheth himself forth to
the utmost extent of your Rod and Line,
which a well-fed Fish at all times frequently
attempts, upon the least Advantage he gains on
the Angler: be mindful therefore to throw
him Line enough, if provided you purpose to
see his Destruction; yet with this Caution, that
you be not too liberal. On the other hand,
too streight a Line brings equal Hazard; so
that to poize your Fish, and your fore-sight to|gether,
is, by keeping one Eye at the Point of
your Rod, and the other be sure you direct on
your Game: which comes nearest the Mediums
of Art, and the Rules and Rudiments of your
precedent Directions.</P>
<P>But this great Wound is easily solv'd; for
if when to discover your Fish fag his Fins, you
may rationally conclude he then struggles with
Death: and then is your time to trifle him a
Shore on some smooth Shelf of Sand, where
you may boldly land him, before his Scales en|counter
the Soil; which he no sooner appre|hends
by the prospect of Death approaching;
as a dying Man that grasps every Twig, be|cause
<PB N="73" REF="58">
thinking thereby to save himself; so
will your Game extinguish his Strength, and
blaze out the Flames of his Life with a Strug|gle.</P>
<P>Another Expedient is the landing-Net; or
the Landing-Rod, which I rather approve of:
let the Swim be deep, or let it be shallow, we
direct this Artifice to amuse the Fish, and fa|cilitate
his Destruction, when he struggles with
Difficulties: Notwithstanding all this, some
Hazards must be encountred, by the more In|genious
that flies high at his Game. Incom|parable
Sport the Salmon makes; and so did
this, for he made me laugh.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so severe to run at my Misfortune?
take the Rod if you please, and display your
Skill, i'le defy all your Art to discover such a
Fish; though unfortunate I must confess, to ha|zard
my Reputation, with such ill Success;
whereby to lose such an eminent Encounter:
but I am come to that point of Resolution
now, that Fish that comes next but to smell my
Hook, shall prize the Scent on't so long as he
lives; where an Inch of my Line shall cost him
an Ell of his Life; though he attempts to saw
my Line in sunder, with the ragged and jagged
Teeth of his Tail.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And is this the Earnest you intend to
handsel us with? Such a small Stock of Expe|rience
will neither admit of general nor parti|cular
Directions to instruct and initiate Profici|ents
in the Art, to try their skill with a reso|lute
Fish. Reach hither your Rod, and that Bag
of Flies. Now should Fortune contribute
equal Success, we need not despair of a hungry
<PB N="74" REF="59">
Breakfast: however, i'le adventure, and have
in amongst 'em; Did you see him show?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I see something make a Show;
and it may be Fish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a Fish with an <HI>it,</HI> and a <HI>may be</HI>
too? stand close, I advise you, for he'l rise a|gain,
provided as hitherto he has made no dis|covery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then, will you discipline and teach
him the Art of Invasion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'le teach him to know that if one Ele|ment
won't contain him, another must; so, so,
I have him fast enough to distinguish the differ|ence.
And now for the Landing-Rod to measure
his Dimensions. See where he lies, and tell me
how you like him; can you think him as large
as that you encountred?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's no matter what I think; it may be
he's Inferiour, or it may be Superiour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's modestly Ingenious, to lessen
your Loss by advancing my Reputation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you more than fortunate to succeed
so well: shall we lap up our Lines, and return to
<HI>Dumfreez?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my Heart, for the Clock strikes
Ten; and the Sun is in his Elevation towards
the Meridian. This is no time for farther ex|amination,
till about four after Noon; except in
an obscure and clowdy Day: for the Crisis
and critical Time for Diversion, is late in the
Evening, or early in the Morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's enough I perceive; your generous
Motion moves me to wave the present Recre|ation.
On the other hand, your Experience I
must confess promulges the Art, and your self
<PB N="75" REF="59">
an Artist. All this I grant, and more than
this, since to confirm this Evidence quickens my
Appetite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, but what think you of the Wing of
an Ox? Would not such a Modicum melt
sweetly in your Mouth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>If luxurious Dreams, and Witches Ban|quets
are equally alike impoverish'd Vanity;
then to contemplate <HI>England</HI> in the Bowels of
<HI>Scotland</HI> will represent to us but fictitious De|lusions.
Rather would I have you tell me how
you like the Commons, and tell me then how
you approve the Cookery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I like it so well, that I could heartily
wish it had been better ordered for your En|tertainment;
but the difficulty is such in this
Northern Latitude, that good Cooks and good
Fish seldom dwell together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let them dwell asunder; however,
it's well it is as it is, better ill-cook'd than none
at all. However, in the mean while reflect on
your self, and give us a Description of the Town
of <HI>Dumfreez.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy e're long you will change your
Note, when you traverse these pleasant Nor|thern
Tracts. In the mean time I'll gratify
you with a Breviate of <HI>Dumfreez,</HI> where a
Provost, as Superintendent, supplies the place of
a Mayor; a Magistrate almost as venerable as
an English Constable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's wittily applied; What comes
next?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, hold a little, I have not done yet
with the Eminencies and the Remarks of the
Town of <HI>Dumfreez;</HI> for you are to consider it
<PB N="76" REF="60">
was anciently a Town girt about with a strong
Stone Wall: But the late Irruptions, or per|haps
some State-Disagreement has in a manner
defaced that regular Ornament; otherwise the
cankrous Teeth of Time have gnawn out the
Impressions, as evidently appears by those rui|nous
Heaps. Nor is the <HI>Arnotus</HI> in all parts
portable, notwithstanding her Shores are so de|lightful.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is there more yet? Pray go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the midst of the Town is their Mar|ket-place,
and in the Centre of that stands their
Tolbooth, round about which the Rabble sit,
that nauseate the very Air with their tainted
Breath, so perfum'd with Onions, that to an
English-Man it is almost infectious.</P>
<P>But the Kirk is comely, and situated South-ward,
furnished once a Week with moveable
Spectrums, (you know what that means) yet
the Outside than the Inside is more eminently
imbellished, if Sepulchres and Tombstones can
be said to be Ornaments: And where Death
and Time stand to guard the Steeple, whose
Rings of Bells seldom or rarely exceed the cri|tical
Number of Three.</P>
<P>Here also you may observe a large and spa|cious
Bridg, that directly leads into the Country
of <HI>Galloway,</HI> where thrice in a Week you shall
rarely fail to see their Maid-Maukins dance Co|ranto's
in Tubs. So on every Sunday some as
seldom miss to make their Appearance on the
Stool of Repentance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it seems by your Relation they
keep time with their Comers, that hazard their
Reputation for a Country-Custom (or the love
<PB N="77" REF="60">
of Liquor) rather than omit a four-Hours
drinking.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true enough; and it's an antient
Practice among the Female Sex, to covee toge|ther
(about that time) as naturally as Geese
flock'd to the Capitol. Now the very Name
of <HI>Comer</HI> they mightily honour; but that of
<HI>Gossip</HI> they utterly abominate, as they hate the
Plague, or some mortal Contagion. So that
whether to conclude it a vulgar Error, and an
Abomination among the Scots to lick up an
English Proverb, it matters not: Or whether
to fancy a more laudable Emphasis in the word
<HI>Comer,</HI> than there is in <HI>Go-sip;</HI> I leave you
to judg of that, and those other abominable
Customs, that drink till they sigh to do Penance
for their Sins. Will this expiate the Crime, and
extenuate the Fact?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, when Oil quenches Fire; or Fire
forgets its natural force to burn. So let us leave
<HI>Dumfreez,</HI> and accommodate our selves with
the Country-Curiosities: and to make our
Design yet more sweet and pleasant, let us rally
what Descriptions of Places we can, not only
to gratify our selves but others. In the mean
time favour me with your bad Fortune of the
Dish of Sewins, and the Duck <HI>Moggy</HI> drest,
when she flung it into the Fire, to singe off the
Feathers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why thus to reflect on the Country-Absurdities?
Had you been then in place, di|stress'd
as we were, I doubt not but that Duck
had gone daintily down, notwithstanding you
think it so sluttishly cook'd. Hunger at no time
solicits Sauce to incite; and Necessity as little as
<PB N="78" REF="61">
any thing disputes Dainties. The Landskip
of Want invades natural Strength, and reads
Lectures legibly in any Man's Features. But
the manner of their Cookery, or rather Scotish
Sluttery, I'll tell you the Story, and how it was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall be very attentive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Near the English Promontories stands
the Town of <HI>Iedard,</HI> whose Skirts are wash'd
by the famous <HI>Tweed.</HI> But Westward from
thence (and inclining yet more Norward) are
the remarkable Antiquities and Ruins of <HI>Bog|hall;</HI>
and not far from thence is the admirable
<HI>Tintaw,</HI> a prodigious Mountain over-looking
the Marshes. From whence, or from <HI>Erric|steen</HI>
(that's not far from it) there issue forth
three eminent and considerable Rivers; as that
of the <HI>Tweed, Loyd,</HI> and the River <HI>Annon:</HI> But
of these three Rivers we shall discourse more at
large, as opportunity presents in its proper place.</P>
<P>And now let's advance to our Country Cot|tage,
since compelled by the Extremity of Rain,
and encreasing Waters. To which place when
we arrived, like Men in amaze, we stood ga|zing
at one another, because to see the Sheep
grazing on the Tops of those Houses, where
there was hardly Grass enough to graze a Goose
in. By this you may conclude their Buildings
but low, and I'm sure their Doors and Entrances
were so strait, that they exercised our Strength
beyond our Art. <HI>Archimedes</HI> Engines signified
but little, till the Souldiers set their Shoulders
to support the Eves by which means the Horse
got an Entrance in: and that Horseman that
was not throughly wet, was doom'd that
Night to go Supper-less to Bed.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="61">
Thus in a Storm we stormed the Town, and
'twould make a Man storm to be treated only
with Oatmeal, of which we made Cakes; for
every Souldier became a Baker; and the Flesh-meat
they procured us was drest without Slaugh|ter;
for none we had except my Duck (you
formerly discours'd) so that most of us roosted
with an empty Appetite: and every Man that
went that Night to Bed, was sufficiently a|larum'd
before it was Day. Oat-straw was
our Sheets, and Port-mantles our Pillows. It's
true, some had Cloaks, and 'twas well they had
them, otherwise they had been constrained to
use Plads; and he that used one but to cover
his Carcass, mustred (I uphold him) more gray
Coats than black Coats, that claw'd him more
perniciously than a <HI>Middlesex</HI> Bailiff.</P>
<P>The next Day we recruited with some Coun|try
Ale, but so thick and roapy it was, that
you might eat it with Spoons. Besides, some
small quantity of Mutton was brought us, enough
to discover the Cookery of the Country: and
the Linen they supplied us with, were it not to
boast of, was little or nothing different from
those Female Complexions that never washed
their Faces, to retain their Christendom. But
among the rest I had almost forgot to remind
you, that the Souldiers and the People were
jointly agreed to part without the loss of one
Tear in the Morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not to see, nor would I willingly
dream of such bad Commons, a hungry Belly,
and nothing to bite on; nay, worse than that,
more Sluts than Cooks: and in every House fowl
Women, fowl Linen and fowl Pewter; yet in
<PB N="80" REF="62">
their Rivulets such Silver Streams. What, not
a Bed, nor a Thread (but linsey lowsy) to keep
a Man dry! who could project or contrive worse
Entertainment for the worst of his Enemies?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, how now, <HI>Theophilus,</HI> is it that
time of day? he's an early Angler that angles
by Moonshine.</P>

<P>Mistake not your self, I'm only groping

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, <HI>Arnoldus,</HI> I'm almost worried to death
with Lice, my Skin is all motled and dapled
like an <HI>April</HI> Trout. Can you blame me to re|linquish
this lowsy Lodging, when my batter'd
Sides are pinck'd full of Ilet-holes? One Bri|gade
pursues another, and Flight I find the best
Expedient; for my Enemies I perceive are so
desperately resolv'd, that they'll rather die than
quit the Field. Dangers foreseen are the sooner
prevented, and I design to sleep in a whole Skin
as long as I can. <HI>Zanker,</HI> farewel, I am glad to
see thee behind me, and no need of a Chirur|gion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you think of <HI>Boghall,</HI> when the Ver|min
last Night were so busy about you? the
Story of my Duck was pleasant to you, and so
is this to me. Those Characters and Impressi|ons
seal'd on your Sides (by these Scotish Inter|lopers)
will oblige you to remember <HI>Zanker</HI>
these seven days. You have not been used to
such coarse Entertainment, nor treated as I
have been, with such Scots Commons. Is this
the fruits of private Practice to compleat your
<PB N="81" REF="62">
self a Graduate, tho you steal your Preferment
from a Nitty Corporation? at the best you
can be but Batchelor of <HI>Backbiters-hall.</HI> But
now jesting is done, and you're half undone I
perceive; what will you do now in reference
to <HI>Zanker?</HI> can you give us a Relation of that
Corporation?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that I can, and will do, notwith|standing
the Difficulties I have encountred.
<HI>Zanker</HI> stands situate on a Flat or Level, sur|rounded
as you see with excellent Corn-Fields:
but more remote it's besieged with Mountains
that are rich in Lead-Mines. The Planets I
fancy them very benevolent to influence this
swompy Rocky Earth, and shine Metallick Bles|sings
into them, to commode the indigent and
almost uncultivated Native. Heaven it's true,
is always propitious, because never to impose
the Law of Sterility, when to supply the whole
World with the Bounty of Increase. And tho
the People hereabouts are destitute of Ingenui|ty,
and their Fields for the most part impove|rish'd
for want of Cultivation; yet are their
Rivers and Rivulets replenished with Trout,
because undisturb'd with the noosy Net, which
augments the Anglers, if not the Artizans En|tertainment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's no Character of <HI>Zanker</HI> all this
while.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am just coming to tell you, that <HI>Zanker</HI> is
a Town and a Corporation too; tho not bulky
in Buildings, yet there is a Bailiff, Master some|times
of a Brew-house, whose Entertainments
(in my opinion) may easily be guest at, pro|vided
you reflect on our late Accommodation.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="63">
There is also a Market-place, such an one as
it is, and a kind of a thing they call a Tolbooth,
which at first sight might be suspected a Prison,
because it's so like one; whose Decays by the
Law of Antiquity are such, that every Prisoner
is threatned with Death before his Trial; and
every Casement, because bound about with Iron|bars,
discovers the Entertainments destined on|ly
to Felons. Now the Market-place is less
worthy of a Description than the Tolbooth;
for no Man would know it to be such, were he
not told so.</P>
<P>There is also a Kirk, or something like it;
but I might as reverently call it a Barn; because
so little to distinguish betwixt them, and the
whole Town reads daily Lectures of Decays;
so do her Ports, her Avenues and Entrances.
Where note, I call her the Child of Antiquity,
by reason of her Ruins and irreparable Decays.
It's true, I was not murdered, nor was I kill'd
outright, yet I narrowly escaped as eminent a
Danger, when almost worried to death with
Lice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, I am glad you escaped with|out
Scars; and advise for the future, that you
examine your Lodging before you make your
formal Entrance. In the mean time, let me
restitute some part of Amendment, by an easy,
tho solitary Journy over this mountanous Coun|try,
to sweeten your Entertainment. And in
regard of your Unexperience in these Northern
Tracts, I shall direct our Course through the
Coast of <HI>Galloway,</HI> a Compendium of the High|lands
immerg'd in the Arms of the Low-lands:
and I'll appeal to your self, when you have seen
<PB N="83" REF="63">
her Fertility, if you do not envy her blest In|habitants,
because inrich'd with the Plenty of
Rivers and Rivulets, Woods and Groves; be|sides,
benevolent Fields, and profitable Pastures
Yet sometimes we must ramble o're some rotten
Bogs, as now we do; and permit our Feet (as
at other times) to climb those knotty craggy
Mountains, that, like a Gnomen, direct to the
Town of <HI>Kilmarnock,</HI> a kind of a Corporation,
where we may expect the comfortable Issues of
good Entertainment; for worse than the last is
madness to contemplate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is that the <UNCLEAR>Town</UNCLEAR> that presents at a
distance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that is <HI>Kilmarnock,</HI> an antient Cor|poration,
heap'd up and crowded with Men and
Mechanicks: through the midst of whose crazy
tottering Ports, there runs a River replenished
with Trout, where we may treat our Appetites, as
already our Apprehensions, with the Entertain|ments
of <HI>Dumbarton,</HI> whose rapid Streams when
we come to examine them, are enough one
would think to surfeit the Angler. To which
place it is now but one days Journy, nor need
we hackney it at more than an ordinary rate,
before we discover those beautiful Ascents, and
the Hostile Habitation <UNCLEAR>of</UNCLEAR> our Friend <HI>Aquilla,</HI>
that dwells in those Western florid Fields, who
will bid us welcome, and rejoice to see us. Nor
will <HI>Glasgow</HI> be any Impediment in our way,
whilst we only survey her beautiful Palaces,
so direct to the lofty Turrets of <HI>Dumbarton.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let the Sun, or his Star the beauti|ful
<HI>Aurora,</HI> arrest me, if otherwise I arise not
before break of Day, and be in readiness for a
<PB N="84" REF="64">
March to the famous <HI>Glasgow,</HI> where you pur|pose
to refresh, and briefly examine the City-Curiosities;
as also the Customs of their mag|nificent
Situations: whose Academick Breasts
are a Nursery for Education, as the City for
Hospitality. And let this be your Task as we
travel to <HI>Dumbarton,</HI> to give us a Narrative of
the Antiquities of <HI>Cloyd,</HI> as also of the Town
of <HI>Kilmarnock,</HI> where we slept this Night, that
so bravely refresh'd us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I can do as we ride along.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do so, it will be very acceptable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then to expostulate the Antiquities of
<HI>Kilmarnock;</HI> as it would puzzle the Pen of an
ingenious Historiographer, so I for that end
was thinking to evade it, and refer it to some
other of more mature Judgment; since you your
self, and consequently others that read my Re|lation,
will probably reduce me to the Probate
of a Censure. On the other hand, the Native
who lives under an Expectation, would equally
condemn me for my Taciturnity, should I si|lently
pass by and imprint no Remarks on their
Silty Sands, and Silver Streams. To this Di|lemma
I am driven by the Censures of some,
nor can I escape the Clamours of others:
So that I sail betwixt <HI>Sylla</HI> and <HI>Charibdis.</HI>
However, I shall use my best Endeavours to
gratify both as near as I can, and consult the
mean and Mediums of Veracity, so far as Ex|perience
and Discovery can inform me: So that
I shall say but little more than to tell the World
that <HI>Kilmarnock</HI> is an antient Corporation,
crowded with Mechanicks and Brew-houses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>But that's not all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="85" REF="64">
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>If not enough, then you must have
more it seems; and not only for your self, but
for those that are more inquisitous. And what
will they say? why you and they both will tell
me, it's only risling into Ruins. Nor indeed is
it other, when in our Progress we proceed to
prove little more, save only a discovery of Ru|ins
and Decays.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be it what it will however let us have it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, if to go one step further,
surely it won't cripple me: let me tell you then,
it's an Antient Manufactory.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what of all that? is this more than
what we formerly knew?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's more than I knew, that you knew so
much. But this Discourse, <HI>Theophilus,</HI> better
becomes an Antiquary, than one that queries:
for should I but step into her dirty Streets, that
are seldom clean but on a Sun-shiny Day; or
at other Times, when great Rains melt all
the Muck, and forcibly drive it down their
cadaverous Channels into the River <HI>Marr,</HI> whose
Streams are so sullied then, that the River
loses its natural Brightness, till the Stains are
wash'd out, so become invisible. All which to
examine, is enough to convince you, that the
Influence of Planets are their best Scavenger:
for the Natives in this Northern Latitude, are
naturally so addicted to Idleness and Nastiness,
that should not the Heavens contribute the
Blessings of Rain, they would inevitably sur|feit
with their own Uncleanliness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this we will grant you; the Foot|steps
are evident.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where note, these Inhabitants dwell in
<PB N="86" REF="65">
such ugly Houses, as in my Opinion are but lit|tle
better than Huts; and generally of a Size,
all built so low, that their Eves hang dangling
to touch the Earth: nor are they uniform, nor
hold they Correspondency one with another:
and that which is worse than all the rest, is
their unproportionate ill Contrivance; because,
when to consider a Dwarf of a House, so co|vered
over with a Gigantick Roof. By which
you may imagine, our former Projectors had
but little Project for curious Contrivances; and
to speak plain English, as little costly.</P>
<P>The next thing in course that falls under our
Consideration, will be their Artificers. But
the Moors (more than all the rest) have gain'd
the Reputation for the temper of Dirks, Razors
and Knives, whose Temper is so exact, that
it super-excels all the Mechanicks in <HI>Scotland.</HI>
Where note, you may observe there are Artists
amongst them, though not one good Structure
to be found in <HI>Kilmarnock;</HI> nor do I remember
any Wall it has, but a River there is, as I for|merly
told you of, that runs through the
Town; over which there stood a Bridg so
wretchedly ancient, that it's unworthy our
Commendations any otherwise, than as Travel|lers
commend the Bridg they go over.</P>
<P>Another part of their Manufacture is knitting
of Bonnets, and spinning of Scotish Cloth;
which turns to very good Account. Then for
their Temper of Metals, they are without
compeer; <HI>Scotland</HI> has not better. And as
they are Artizans in Dirks, so are they Artists
in Fudling, as if there were some Rule in
Drinking. So that to me it represents as if
<PB N="87" REF="65">
Art and Ale were inseparable Companions.
Moreover, their Wives are sociable Comers too;
yet not to compare with those of <HI>Dumblain,</HI> who
pawn their Petticotes to pay their Reckoning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's a jolly Crew of Alemen (but ve|ry
few Anglers) crowded together in the small
compass of a little Corporation, curiously com|pacted.
For the Houses you may observe be|siege
the River; and that River to divide the
ruinous Ports, left only as Reliques that remain
discoverable: however it's my Opinion that a
Stone Wall has incircled the Town, since hi|therto
as to Observation, there's rarely a Town
of any eminency in <HI>Scotland,</HI> but is or has
been beleagured with a strong Stone Wall; but
as to that i'le silence my self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, I'le proceed to pilot you
down these solitary Descents, that direct to the
eminent Ports of <HI>Air,</HI> near whose difficult en|trances
stands a strong Citadel, formidable and
spacious, in the Base of a Pentagon, erected on
purpose to reduce Insurrectors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Must we dismount these Hills, to traverse
those Valleys?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, surely we must, if designing to
trace the fertil Fields and beautiful Plains of
the now famous and flourishing <HI>Glasgow,</HI> where
we may accommodate our selves with various
Guriosities; for the Days are long enough, and
our Journey no more than a breathing to <HI>Dum|barton.</HI>
Now the first Curiosity that invites
us to gaze at, is a large and spacious Bridg of
Stone, that directs to the fair lmbellishments of
<HI>Glasgow.</HI> But our next Entertainment, is the
pleasant Medows, and the portable Streams of
<PB N="88" REF="66">
the River <HI>Cloyd,</HI> eminent in three Capacities.
The first is, because of her numberless numbers
of Trout. The second is, because of her mul|tiplicity
of Salmon. But the third and last is,
from her native Original, and gradual De|scents;
because so calmly to mingle her Streams
with the Ocean. Not that we now consider
her florid Medows, nor shall we recount her
Nativity from <HI>Tintaw,</HI> because so strongly op|posed
and presum'd from <HI>Erricsteen,</HI> distant
from thence some few odd Miles.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you please, let that Argument drop
till farther Opportunity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am thinking to do so, and proceed to
discourse this eminent <HI>Glasgow.</HI> Which is a
City girded about with a strong Stone-Wall,
within whose flourishing Arms, the Industrious
Inhabitant cultivates Art to the utmost. There
is also a Cathedral (but it's very Ancient) that
stands in the East Angle, supervising the Bulk
of the City, and her ornamental Ports. More|over,
there are two Parish-Churches; but no
more to the best of my Observation. Then
there is a College; which they call an Universi|ty,
but I'm at a stand what to call it, where
one single College compleats a University.</P>
<P>Now let us descend to describe the Splendor
and Gaity of this City of <HI>Glasgow;</HI> which sur|passeth
most, if not all the Corporations in
<HI>Scotland.</HI> Here it is you may observe four large
fair Streets, modell'd, as it were, into a spaci|ous
Quadrant; in the Centre whereof their
Market-place is fix'd; near unto which stands a
stately <HI>Tolbooth,</HI> a very sumptuous, regulated,
uniform Fabrick, large and lofty, most industri|ously
<PB N="89" REF="66">
and artificially carved from the very Foun|dation
to the Superstructure, to the great ad|miration
of Strangers and Travellers. But this
State-house or <HI>Tolbooth,</HI> is their Western Pro|digy,
infinitely excelling the model and usual
built of Town-halls; and is, without excepti|on,
the Paragon of Beauty in the West; whose
Compeer is no where to be found in the North,
should you rally the Rarities of all the Corpo|rations
in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Reader (it's possible) may think I
hyperbolize; but let him not mistake himself,
for I write no Ambiguities: Truth stands naked
in plain Simplicity; and Partiality I abhor as
a base Imposture. He that reads my Relati|on,
and the Morals of this famous <HI>Glasgow,</HI>
will vindicate my Description, and place the
Fault to him that invents the Fable; for it's op|posite
to my Genius, as also to my Principles,
either to deface a beautiful Fabrick, or contract
a Guilt by magnifying it beyond its due Me|rit.
I have, and therefore shall, as near as I
can, in an equal Poize ballance things aright.
Permit me therefore, as a Licentiat, to read
you but a short, yet pertinent Lecture, and I'le
tell you what Entertainments we met with in
<HI>Glasgow,</HI> as also what hopes we have to meet
with the like in the Circuit of our intended
Northern Progress. But this I offer to the Du|bious
only; if peradventure there be any such
as scruple, I'le refer them to the Natives to
evidence for me, which I am satisfied they will
with ten thousand Manifesto's.</P>
<P>In the next place, we are to consider the
Merchants and Traders in this eminent <HI>Glasgow.</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="67">
Whose Store-houses and Ware-houses are stuft
with Merchandize: as their Shops swell big
with Foreign Commodities, and Returns from
<HI>France,</HI> and other remote Parts; where they
have Agents and Factors to correspond, and
inrich their Maritime Ports, whose Charter ex|ceeds
all the Charters in <HI>Scotland:</HI> which is a
considerable Advantage to the City-Inhabitants;
because blest with Privileges as large, nay,
larger than any other Corporation. Moreover,
they dwell in the Face of <HI>France,</HI> and a Free
Trade, as I formerly told you. Nor is this
all, for the Staple of their Country consists of
Linens, Friezes, Furs, Tartans, Pelts, Hides,
Tallow, Skins, and various other small Ma|nufactures
and Commodities, not comprehend|ed
in this Breviat. Besides, I should remind
you, that they generally exceed in good <HI>French</HI>
Wines, as they naturally superabound with Fish
and Fowl; some Meat does well with their
Drink. And so give me leave to finish my dis|course
of this famous <HI>Glasgow,</HI> whose Ports
we relinquish to distinguish those Entertain|ments
of <HI>Dumbarton,</HI> always provided we scat|ter
no Corn.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What to think, or what to say of this
eminent <HI>Glasgow,</HI> I know not; except to fancy
a smell of my Native Country. The very Pro|spect
of this flourishing City, reminds me of
the beautiful Fabricks, and the florid Fields in
<HI>England,</HI> so that now I begin to expect a
pleasant Journey. Pray tell me, <HI>Arnoldus,</HI> how
many such Cities shall we meet with in our
Travels; where the Streets and the Channels
are so cleanly swept, and the Meat in every
<PB N="91" REF="67">
House so artificially drest? the Linen I also
observed was very neatly lap'd up; and, to
their praise be it spoke, was Lavender proof:
besides, the People were decently drest, and
such an exact Decorum in every Society, repre|sents
it to my apprehension an Emblem of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
though in some measure under a deeper
Die. However I'le superscribe it the Nonsuch of
<HI>Scotland;</HI> where an <HI>English</HI> Florist may pick up a
Posie: so that should the residue of their Cities
in our Northern Progress seem as barren as un|cultivated
Fields; and every Field so replen|ished
with Thistles, that a Flower could scarce|ly
flourish amongst them, yet would I celebrate
thy Praise, O <HI>Glasgow,</HI> because of those plea|sant
and fragrant Flowers that so sweetly re|fresh'd
me, and to admiration, sweetned our
present Entertainments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now the Day-star springs, and the fla|ming
Steeds of the Sun invite our departure.
The Smiles of the Weather prognosticate we
shall reach <HI>Dumbarton</HI> in very good time; where
we may redress and refit such Tackle, as shall
serve to accommodate both our Art and Ex|ercise:
for near to those famous and flourish|ing
Ports, there glides a rapid and perempto|ry
River, that gulphs forth of the Bowels of
<HI>Loemon,</HI> replenished with Trout; and beyond
all measure of incomparable Salmon, (if I cal|culate
right) where we may sport to Day, and
to Morrow too, provided the Season serve to
our purpose. So from thence we may pass in|to
the Fields of <HI>Luss,</HI> (by fording the <HI>Loemon</HI>)
where beyond dispute we shall gratify our selves
with such solitary Entertainments, as the Angler
<PB N="92" REF="68">
most delights in: So from thence by crossing
the <HI>Loemon</HI> Eastward, we arrive in the steril
Fields of <HI>Bohanan;</HI> a Situation by some
thought almost inaccessible, by reason of Hills,
and multiplicity of Boggs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What lofty domineering Towers are
those that storm the Air, and stand a tiptoe
(to my thinking) upon two stately elevated
pondrous Rocks, that shade the Valley with their
prodigious Growth, even to amazement? be|cause
to display such adequate and exact Pro|portion,
with such equality in their Monta|nous
Pyramides, as if Nature had stretch'd
them into Parallel Lines, with most accurate
poize to amuze the most curious and critical
Observer; though with exquisite Perspectives
he double an Observation, yet shall he never
trace a Disproportion in those uniform Pier|monts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are those natural, and not arti|ficial
Pyramides, that have stood, for ought I
know, since the beginnings of Time; nor are
they sheltred under any Disguise: for Nature
her self drest up this elaborate Precipice, with|out
Art or Engine, or any other Manual, till
arriving at this period of Beauty and Perfecti|on:
and because having Laws and Limits of
her own, destinated by the Prerogative Royal
of Heaven, she heap'd up these Massy inacces|sible
Pyramides, to invalidate Art, and all its
Admirers, since so equally to shape a Mountain,
and to form it into so great and such exact
Proportions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it's no Fancy I perceive, when in
the midst of those lofty and elevated Towers,
<PB N="93" REF="68">
a Palace presents it self unto us, immured with
Rocks, and a craggy Front that with a haugh|ty
Brow contemns the Invader. And where
below at those knotty Descents, <HI>Neptune</HI> ca|reers
on brinish Billows, arm'd with <HI>Tritons</HI>
in Corslets of Green, that threatens to invade
this impregnable Rock, and shake the Founda|tions;
which if he do, he procures an Earth|quake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is the Rock, and that which you
see elevated in the Air, and inoculated to it,
is an artificial Fabrick, invelop'd as you now
observe in the very Breast of this prodigious
Mountain; which briefly, yet well enough, your
Observation directs to, both as to the Form,
Situation and Strength. Moreover, it's a Ga|rison,
and kept by the <HI>Albions,</HI> where former|ly
our Friend <HI>Foelecius</HI> dwelt; who of late, up|on
Preferment, is transplanted into <HI>Ireland&punc;</HI>
however <HI>Aquilla</HI> will bid us welcome; and if
I mistake not, he advances to meet us; look
wishly forward, and you'l see him trace those
delightful Fields from the Ports of <HI>Dumbarton.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aquil.</SPEAKER>
<P>What vain Delusions thus possess me!
nay what idle Dotages and Fictitious Dreams
thus delude me; if these be Ghosts, which I
fancy Men. O Heavens! it's our Friend <HI>Ar|noldus,</HI>
and (if I mistake not) <HI>Theophilus</HI> with
him. Welcome to <HI>Dumbarton.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thanks dear <HI>Aquilla,</HI> thus friendly to
salute us; we are come to see you, and have
deserted the beautiful Tracts of <HI>Albion,</HI> to
trample the solitary Fields in <HI>Scotland.</HI> Behold
these Evidences; we have brought our Rods,
where note you may easily guess our Design.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="94" REF="69">
<SPEAKER>Aquil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Above all Men you are fortunate; for
had you studied an Age to time your Busi|ness
for a Day's Diversion, the Heavens could
not shine Stars more propitious. Do but see
how the Ground is chap'd and parch'd, and the
Streams so lean and barren of Soil, as well they
may, for no moisture has fallen to refresh the
Earth, nor drive down Soil to recruit the Ri|vers
and feast the Fish, this Month or more,
till yesterday; and then the Clouds began to
dapple, the Face of the Firmament to lowre,
the Sky to discolour, the Air to moisten, and
the Spouts of Heaven seemingly to drop: yet
when all came to all, it came to nothing; for
the Tears of this Storm converted into a Calm;
so exhal'd into Meteors, for ought I know:
for when we expected a Deluge of Rain, there
fell by chance but some few extravagant Drops;
which for Greediness made the Fish almost
forsake the Water; the Complexion whereof
being but a little changed, you may fancy, if
you please, to fish under a Colour.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Notwithstanding all this I'm for the Fly.</P>

<P>Then I'm for the Ground-bait, and
I perswade my self it will turn to best Account,
and prove most profitable to answer my Ex|pectation:
For with but three sorts of Fish we
must trifle our time (<HI>viz.</HI>) the active Eel, the
dextrous Trout, and the incomparable Salmon;
all which will as greedily pursue a Worm, as a
luxurious Appetite pursues his Paunch. Bring
but a Brandlin or rather a Gildtail, and try
whether Trouts be destitute of an Appetite.</P>

<SPEAKER>Aquil.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are waggish, <HI>Theophilus,</HI> but really
I am serious; for now we begin to discover
those silent and solitary Deeps, those rapid and
swift Falls of Water, besides those stiff and
strong Streams, that invite us to treat the
Family of Fish. So that I conceive it is almost
impossible to direct a Line, and miss a Reward:
And the bottom, if you please, let us examine
that with Ground-bait, to prove the Effects of
our Art and Skill, to summons Contribution
from so generous an Adventure. But if Mid|water
we consult, then I commend the Canker,
with the Catter-pillar, or the Grub; or, if with
a depinged Locust, you will not lose your La|bour;
nor will you starve your Cause, if to strip
off the Legs of a Grashopper. All these are
excellent Baits, but the green Monket of the
Owlder-Tree super-excels them all. Then
there's the Pink (which you call a Minew) if
display'd with a Swivel at Mid-water; or you
may if you please drag him from the bottom of
the Deeps, so glide him all along through the
Region of Limpid Streams, the better to dis|play
this amorous Charm, so obtain the Point
by the Mediums of Art, as already is advisable
by consulting the Artist.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I perceive we but trifle Time, this
tedious Discourse obstructs Recreation. Let
us stretch our Limbs with the length of the
Streams; we have Day enough and pleasant
Weather, why then so vainly to procrastinate
Time with flattering Thoughts of suggested En|joyments,
which signify no more than Honour
<PB N="96" REF="70">
in Dreams? Come, my Friends, let us reform
that Error by the Progress of Art. So that if
our Labours be spent to advantage, and our
selves, like Artists, sufficiently recompensed by
the Rod; we may sport the Day away, and
lengthen our Expectation, that to Morrow's Re|creation,
if the Season favour us, may glut us
with Pleasure, and burden us with Spoil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>We shall cross the old Proverb I perceive,
since no Arguments are Engines strong enough
to convince <HI>Theophilus,</HI> that Haste makes waste;
whose unlimited Zeal after Recreation is bound|less
beyond measure; insomuch that a <HI>Grompus</HI>
won't gratify him in point of Diversion. Come
then, and trim up your Line, and arm your self,
and observe those translucid trembling Streams
that dash themselves against those Rocks; ha|zard
your Fortune there for once, and be sure
you begin at the Head of the Stream, and so
gradually pursue the extent of your Colony,
and fish by Direction according to Prescription,
both with Worm and Minew; then hope a pro|sperous
Issue, as I question not but you do. In
the mean time let me caution you, that with
circumspection you purdue your self, if intend|ing
to surprize and captivate your Game; for by
this time I fancy you have already beleagured
them: Be advised therefore to repeat your Disci|pline,
and keep your Distance. So I leave you to
your Fortune and a fair Day, for I purpose to
attempt the Head of <HI>Loemon;</HI> and about four
Hours, or it may be five, let us make our Ren|dezvouz
in the Caves of that Rock. As for
<HI>Aquilla,</HI> he needs no Direction, whose Know|ledg
and Experience is so general in these
<PB N="97" REF="70">
Streams, that an Age to examine them would
not better improve him. Now let us separate,
and each Man to his Adventure; but be mind|ful
of the Place, and the prefix'd Time ap|pointed:
so that after the delicious Toil of
Exercise, we may produce the Issues and Effects
of our Labours, when successfully we meet, as
I hope we may. <HI>Aquilla,</HI> farewel, and fare|wel
<HI>Theophilus;</HI> to whom I contribute my
Wishes for thy fortunate Success, to gain the
Laureat from the best of Anglers that pursue
the Art.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, do you question it, that know
so well my Abilities? here I'le stand to my
Arms; and in this solitary place, I'le hazard
my Rod and Line with my Reputation and For|tune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aquil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Resolv'd like a Vertuoso of the Rod
and Line; there you may mingle Meditations
with your Recreations, whilst you consult those
purling murmuring Streams that rally from the
top of those craggy Mountains: see how they
trickling tumble down those solitary Rocks,
whose Descents, like Diapasons, shap'd into mu|sical
Sounds, must of necessity invite the Fish
to dance: so that sometimes they elevate
themselves so high, that I have seen them
throw themselves a Foot above Water. This
we call the <HI>Contemplative Angler's Harmony;</HI> and
it proves his Harvest too, when they freely bite.
So farewel, <HI>Theophilus;</HI> but remember the Ren|dezvouz
at the previous Descent of that spaci|ous
Rock, beautified with Firs; not far from
thence stands a pleasant Grove: through which
there glides a glittering Rivulet, begirt round
<PB N="98" REF="71">
about with admirable Rocks: search well those
Meanders, and you'l find me fishing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's very like I may, And what then?
In the mean time, here I'm deprived of Society,
except to fancy Fish my solitary Companions,
the Cavities of Rocks my Sepulchre, and these
shady flourishing Trees an Emblem of Death;
for <HI>Aquilla</HI> he is gone, and <HI>Arnoldus</HI> has left me
to lament my Self, and five hours Separation.
But why so melancholy among these purling
Streams, that seemingly interpose betwixt my
Passion, and their silent murmurings? Do not
these repeated Ecchoes (if I hit the Key)
lively remonstrate the life-touches of Solitudes,
and the true Imitation of sweet Contemplati|on?
Sympathy in affection, I call that amiable;
and the fair and beautiful Prospect of the
Mind, that represents the real Signature of
Friendship.</P>
<P>But this Pace I perceive won't carry on my
Design, nor are Complaints proper Engines or
sutable Instruments to surprize Fish. How piti|fully
it looks for the Angler to lie puling,
whilst Fish like Allegators are pulling all in
pieces, let any Man judg that's destinated to
be undone. Most unfortunate <HI>Theophilus,</HI> but
now too late to lament thy Remissness; and ra|ther
than unpunished, let thy shameful Loss be
enough to torment thee. What at once all va|nished,
nothing left but thy self! so that were
not I left, there was nothing to laugh at; and
I worthily deserve it, because to lose my
Reputation. What an opportunity have I lost
in losing my Rod, and an equal Fate to lose
my Exercise? but from Twig to Twig I'le tra|verse
<PB N="99" REF="71">
the Streams, and examine every Bush to
repair my Misfortune: so that at leisure I may
lie down, and lament my Remissness; for con|demn'd
by my self, there needs no Judg to
sentence me. Hold a little! I discover some
thing, either the Stock of my Rod, or a Coun|terfeit.
So so, I shall patch up my Losses by
finding my Rod, for it lay where I left it, and
my bag of Flies lies not far from it. And now
I have a Patent, I resolve to take Toll, and
examine what Contribution these Streams will
advance me.</P>
<P>However, lest Precipitancy spoil my Sport,
I'le preponder my Rudiments; and they prog|nostiate
here's a Fish, or something like it; a
fair handsel for a foolish Fisher. But here's the
old Game again that we had at <HI>Dumfreez.</HI>
This capering, for ought I know, may cost
him his Life, for I resolve to hold his Nose to
the Grind-stone: dance on and die, this is the
way to your silent Sepulchre; for upon that
silty gravelly Shelf of Sand, I resolve to land
him, or lose all I have. And now I fancy him
weary of Life, as aged People that are bur|dened
with Infirmities; yet I want Courage to
encounter him, lest fearing to lose him, which
if I do, I impair my Reputation. Howe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">er,
I'le examine my Stock of Confidence, and see
how far that will go: but then I want a Land|ing-hook,
and he is resolute to make an escape;
and I would be as resolute to restrain, and if
possible to confirm him my Prisoner: so that
what Progress to hope for in this solitary Ad|venture,
I know not, till farther examination.
However, here's no Body but Trees to reprove
<PB N="100" REF="72">
me, except these Rocks; and they'l tell no
Tales. Well then, as he wants no Agility to
evade me, I'le endeavour with Activity to ap|proach
him: so that the difference betwixt us
will be only this, he covets Acquaintance but
with one Element, and I would compel him to
examine another.</P>
<P>Navigators report, that Fish can fly, and so
shall this, or I'le forfeit my Discretion; and if
it succeeds well that I conquer this Fish, Ma|triculation
falls in course from the Vertuosos of
the Rod. Now he runs to divert me, or him|self;
but I must invite him nearer Home, for
I fancy no such Distance. Though his Fins
fag, his Tail riggles, his Strength declines, his
Gills look languid, and his Mettle decreaseth;
all which interpret Tokens of Submission: yet
the best News I bring him, is summons of
Death. Yet let not my Rashness preingage me
to a loss of my Game. For to neglect my Ru|diments,
is to ruin my Design, which in plain
terms is the Destruction of this resolute Fish;
who seemingly now measures and mingles his
Proportion with more than one Element: and
doom'd to a Trance, he prostrates himself on
the Surface of the Calmes, dead to apprehen|sion;
save only I want Credit to believe him
dead, when calling to mind my former fatal
Precipitancy, that invited me to a Loss; and so
may this Adventure prove, if I look not well
about me, to land and strand him on that Shelf
of Sand, where I resolve, with my Rod, to
survey his Dimensions. Then have at All,
or it may be Nothing; however it succeeds
well, for I'me insured of a Victory. Wel|come
<PB N="101" REF="72">
a Shore my languishing Combitant, if
only to entertain our Friend <HI>Arnoldus.</HI></P>
<P>I am fast again, or have hold of another
Fish; but I'le undermine his Design by an old
Stratagem: for now I have got the way of
catching them, I only want the knack of Cook|ery
to dress them. The Exercise of Angling
obliges me to love the Art; and I see it's good
to hearken to Counsel; for had I neglected
that, I had run retrograde to Reason, so lost
my Reward. But this Fish I fancy is not so
resolute as the former; this yields himself Cap|tive
upon slight Summons, so dies by the Law
and Force of Artillery. My Hook I perceive
has divested him of Power; and I shall deny
him Capitulation for Life, who must also change
Elements with his late Predecessor, or I'le
lose all I have to compass my Design. I fancy
I have hold of another Fish; if so, I shall want
Arguments to express the Sweets of this Ex|ercise,
and the Pleasure of Solitudes to the
Contemplative Angler. By this you may per|ceive,
it's necessarily requisite at all times, espe|cially
upon Emergencies, to hearken to Coun|sel;
for indisputably had I pursued irregular
Measures, and slighted <HI>Arnoldus</HI> his solid In|structions,
so followed the Dictates of my for|mer
Resolution of making Fish fly, all had
flown in pieces: And how fondly then had I
betrayed my own Folly, by exposing my self
and my Reputation to a loss? On the contra|ry,
I can triumph, and say all is well; and tell
what Execution my Minews have done, that
my Rod and Line and Swivel's secure. Where
note, I think now to pack up my Impliments,
<PB N="102" REF="73">
and hasten to the Place we formerly agreed up|on;
approving it necessary in all Societies to
observe the Punctilio's of Promise among
Friends. Another thing secretly affects me;
and that is, to think what an Artist <HI>Arnoldus</HI>
will extol me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aquil.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is the Place, and the prefix'd
Time of Agreement is at hand; yet on these
glittering Sands there's no Tract to trace the
impress of the Feet of <HI>Arnoldus</HI> or <HI>Theophilus.</HI>
Surely Angling's all Charms, to break the Links
of the golden Chain of Promise. But whi|ther
will these rash Presumptions hurry me?
what, to suspect Friendship, the Diadem and
Darling of Human Society? Yonder he ad|vances,
to the Place appointed; I'le step and
salute him, and make a Present of my fortunate
Successes. These are the Toils and the Fruits
of my Labour, which I freely dedicate to our
Friend <HI>Arnoldus.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where kill'd you these Trouts? With
what Artifice did you surprize them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aquil.</SPEAKER>
<P>With nothing but a Minew, some call
it Penk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I understand your meaning; but where
did you Fish?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aquil.</SPEAKER>
<P>In those purling Streams, at the foot
of that Rock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should have thought it impossible, did
not these Evidences convince me, that so small
a Rivulet should lodg and harbour so large a
Fish. Here's a Salmon <HI>Aquilla,</HI> that I but new|ly
tickled to Death with a Fly; accept my ad|venture,
I have another for <HI>Theophilus</HI> when he
comes up with us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="103" REF="73">
<SPEAKER>Aquil.</SPEAKER>
<P>He is yonder, I see him coming, and
could heartily wish he had seen but the Death
of this brace of Salmon, to put a zealous spur
to his Exercise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides these Salmon, I have two brace
of Trouts, that would make a Cockney's Teeth
stand a Water and spring a Leek, for no other
purpose than to tap his Mouth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aquil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our Fortunes are unequal, the Gar|land
is yours, and never may it wither from
your Heroick Brow. Now we shall see what
improvement <HI>Theophilus</HI> has made in this Pisca|torian
Negotiation. Yonder he comes, let us
hasten to meet him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Welcome <HI>Theophilus!</HI> are our Fortunes
equal? What <HI>Phenomena</HI> of Pleasures spring from
solitary Rocks? How fancy you this inoffensive
Life, to sit in the Sun-shine, then remove into
Shades near the Brinks of bubling murmuring
Rivulets, that sigh a pleasant silent softness,
whilst the Birds harmoniously deliciat the Air,
and Fish in frolicks dance <HI>Coranto</HI>'s to the Ang|ler;
whilst Man (Lord of the Creation) is
captivated with Divine Contemplation; fancy|ing
to himself a kind of an <HI>Elizium,</HI> represent|ing
the shady Fragrancies of Paradise?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>O <HI>Arnoldus,</HI> I was certainly enamoured
to see how the shady Trees hung dangling about
me; whilst the murmuring Streams through
the Lungs of <HI>Zephyrus,</HI> made Musick to my Fan|cy,
tho not to the pitch of the melodious <HI>Phi|lomel,</HI>
and the Chorus of Birds that beat the
Air with their mellifluous Quires, which springs
fresh thoughts of the Non-age of Time, when
<PB N="104" REF="74">
the Constitution of the Creation was a compo|sition
of Harmony.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the luxurious Angler admires ano|ther
Consort. He loves no Musick but the
twang of the Line; nor any Sound, save the
Ecchoes of the Water; no Rest nor Pause, but
impatient till they bite; no Flats nor Sharps,
but solitary Pools and rapid Streams; no Beats
nor Shakes, but strugling and strangling: and,
in short, no close except that of the Panier.
So that I may properly call his Harmony their
Haltering.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just such Success I had; for Art was use|less
to catch such Fish, as careless of their Lives,
they cast them away. Look here <HI>Arnoldus,</HI> I
have brought my Evidences; this Brace I caught,
and this catch'd me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's sutable Diversion, our Exercise
has equaliz'd the Ballance of Success: Not an
Artist amongst us barren of Sport.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aquil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor the Water out of temper; if it
hold so to Morrow, we may flatter our selves the
Town's our own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be so, if all hits right: What,
two Sundays in one Week? Don't you observe
it rain already? However let us trace these
glittering Sands, to those solitary Fields that
direct to <HI>Dumbarton:</HI> we have spent the time to
sufficient Advantage, had there been nothing
more in it than initiating <HI>Theophilus,</HI> whom I
perswade my self will consult the Art, and ma|nifestly
in time approve himself Eminent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come Gentlemen Piscatorians, and Ver|tuoso's
of the Rod, <HI>Dumbarton</HI> begins to pre|sent
<PB N="105" REF="74">
unto us; where like Heros we may tri|umph,
because from these Fords to carry off
such Trophies, as will evidence for us the Re|marks
of Spoil; and where the Inhabitants must
be indigent of Civility, if not civilly to treat
us, whilst we commode them with the choicest
Treasures of <HI>Loemon.</HI> What think you Gen|tlemen?
your Opinion on the Measures I have
taken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aquil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I approve on't very well.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>So do I. But first if you please let us en|ter
their Ports, and examine the Distinction be|twixt
Diet and Disease. As also we may con|sult
if their Beds are burdensome after Exer|cise;
which I desire to experience, and the ra|ther,
in regard (as I perceive) by those Signals,
the sprinkling of Rain, we must be forced to
depart to morrow Morning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aquil.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Sentence too severe; we cannot
morally separate so soon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Morally or Naturally, it must be so; for
when the Coverings of Rain shut up the Case|ments
of Day, and Darkness as a Pavilion
overshades the Night, it's madness to contem|plate
Recreation in Angling, when the Rivers
are hourly recruited with Rains.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aquil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I approve not of hasty Resolves, as
prognosticate a parting before we meet; the
Law of Friendship binds it otherwise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very bad Handsel to earnest our Se|paration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aquil.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it appears: for should every Man
measure his present Occasion by the Rule of
Necessity, my Duty compels me to the Turrets
of <HI>Dumbarton:</HI> And how disconsolate shall I be
<PB N="106" REF="75">
to discourse Rocks and Stones, when deprived
the Society of my Friends and Associates?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>One Day more, <HI>Arnoldus,</HI> will break no
Squares; let Time arrest us, I'le put in Bail.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aquil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's a friendly Advocate to furnish
us with fresh Arguments, that may bring about,
for ought I know, new and fresh Results after
the Series of second Thoughts: Who so un|kind
now to frame a parting, or denounce
the Sentence of a Farewel to morrow?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>That must I, to wander in the Fields of
<HI>Luss</HI> by Sun-rise; otherwise we shall not reach
<HI>Bohannan</HI> by Sun-set.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>So then, my Mouth is stop'd I perceive;
nor have I any thing more to offer by way of
Argument, only my Lamentation for our so
sudden Separation. <HI>Aquilla,</HI> farewel; <HI>Arnol|dus</HI>
and I must jog on together: but assure your
self, if my Stars are but so propitious as to fa|vour
my return by the way of <HI>Dumbarton;</HI> no
Body I'le assure you shall be more soilcitous
than <HI>Theophilus,</HI> to redouble a trouble upon our
Friend <HI>Aquilla;</HI> and for more than a Night:
And so farewel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aquil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot part.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then go along with us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aquil.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's morally impossible; how can I
leave my Charge?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then pray discharge us; for we are up|on
Duty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Aquil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be prosperous and propitious, I'le
pray your Welfare; and contemplate your En|terprizes
in all vertuous Actions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>This your Kindness obliges me to retali|ate,
with as much Piety as becomes a Christian.
So farewel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="107" REF="75">
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>And with as much Religion as becomes
an Angler, accept of my Charity: so farewel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now <HI>Theophilus,</HI> let not Sleep circum|vent
us; the <HI>Loemon,</HI> I perceive, begins to swell.
We must rise with the Sun, or sooner, if pos|sible:
we must not triste nor delay the Time in
crossing the <HI>Loemon,</HI> if we intend to stretch up
the lofty Mountains in the Island of <HI>Luss.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Look back on those inferiour Fabricks

<P>What little <HI>Mediterranian</HI> is this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>The large and spacious <HI>Loemon,</HI> so general|ly
discours'd for the floating Island; but it floats
not here in these solitary Western Fields as fictiti|ously
supposed by the ignorant Reporters. But our
travel will reform that Error in time, when we
come to trace the Mountains beyond <HI>Badanoch.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this Lough, as reported, so numerous
in Islands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes sure; however I shall give you but
a short Description. This <HI>Loemon,</HI> as you see, is
immerg'd with the <HI>High-lands.</HI> On the West
it's bounded with the Island of <HI>Luss;</HI> but on
the East with the barren Fields of <HI>Bohanan:</HI>
Norward it's begirt with the Pass of <HI>Inchcallow;</HI>
and Southward by <HI>Dumbarton,</HI> and the Bounds
about it. But the length of this <HI>Loemon</HI> is
<PB N="108" REF="76">
twenty four Miles; and twenty four Islands the
Natives will tell you are lodg'd in the Arms of
this spacious Lough. Her Breadth, in the lar|gest
place, not to exceed three Leagues over;
and in the narrowest part, some two or three
Miles. This small <HI>Mediterrane</HI> (as you are
pleased to call it) is surrounded with Woods,
Mountains, rockey, boggy, sandy and miry
Earth: and is the greatest inland Sea in <HI>Scot|land;</HI>
nor is it parallel'd with any Southward;
and all the North inferiour to it; excepting on|ly
the Lough called <HI>Ness.</HI> Now from <HI>Loemon</HI>
under the Bray of these lofty Hills, we pass to
the Kirk of <HI>Drummon,</HI> that leads to <HI>Aberfoil;</HI>
a more remarkable Pass than that of <HI>Inchcallow,</HI>
if designing to make Inroads into the Bowels of
the <HI>Highlands.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Place is this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beautiful <HI>Bohanan</HI> besieged with Bogs,
and barrocadoed with Birch-trees; the High|landers
Landskip, and the Lowlanders Pro|spect;
whose boggy Swamps incommode the
Traveller. However, the Natives in the Win|ter-Season,
employ themselves only to recreate
Swine there, because a People uncultivated in
Agriculture. Where note, the Accommodati|ons
of this solitary Country is so rarely under|stood
by the Natives and Inhabitants, that
Strangers for the most part are left destitute of
a Report.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's true enough; so let us relinquish the
Suburbs of <HI>Leven.</HI> to trace the flourishing Skirts
of <HI>Calvin,</HI> whose smiling Streams invite the
Angler to examine them; for here one would
think the Stones were steep'd in the Oil of Oes|pres,
to invite the Fish to come ashore: where
you may observe every bubling Stream reflect a
Smile on the amorous Banks, covered with
Green, and enamell'd with Flowers. Here al|so
the Sylvans upon shady Bushes bathe them|selves
in silver Streams; and where Trouts to
sport and divert the Angler, will leap on Shore,
though with the loss of their Lives: so that if
Demonstration be Truth, and Eye-sight Evidence
to convince the incredulous, there's not a Ri|vulet
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> upon the Angler's examination,
superexcels this <HI>Calvin,</HI> for diversion with small
Trout; whose translucid Streams, because so
rich in themselves, and so numerous in Trouts,
make them not over-curious of self-preserva|tion;
for with a Rod in my Hand (but I al|most
blush to report it, because suspecting the
incredulity of some incredulous Persons) I
have ushered to those pleasant and delightful
Shores, ten or twelve brace of Trouts in an
Hour.</P>
<P>Distant from <HI>Calvin</HI> about some two Miles
Eastward, stands dull <HI>Dunkeeth,</HI> upon the head
of a slaty Rivulet, that's replenished with Eel,
and plenty of small Trout: but more South|ward
yet is craggy <HI>Cragbarnoch:</HI> from whence
<PB N="110" REF="77">
North and by East we discover the ruinous Bat|tlements
and unpolished Turrets of sooty <HI>Glor|ret.</HI>
It's true, the Natives call it a Castle, but
I fancy the Name of a House would have served
as well: near to which place glides the glitte|ring
<HI>Kaldar;</HI> a large and spacious rapid River,
accommodated both with Trout and Salmon:
but the Access lies too open, more especially a|mongst
her pleasant gliding Streams, where the
Angler, if Lord of his Exercise, may expect
incredible Entertainments: whose Foundations
are laid in gravelly Sand, and interchangably
mix'd with shining Stones that look not unlike
to golden Granulaes: but were they such, I
should fancy <HI>Tagus</HI> but a Toy to it. Because to
imprint in the Angler's Memory those remar|kable
Characters of shining Rocks, glittering
Sands, and falls of Water, which 'tis morally
impossible he should ever forget.</P>
<P>Not far from this dingy Castle of <HI>Glorret,</HI>
stands delectable <HI>Kilsieth;</HI> in whose martial
Fields, Marquess <HI>Montross</HI> defeated his Coun|try-Men.
North-West from thence we must top
those burdened Mountains of <HI>Compsy,</HI> whose
weeping Rocks moisten the Air, representing
the Spouts; and are a lively Emblem of the
Cataracts of <HI>Nile.</HI> From whence we descend to
the Kirk of <HI>Compsy;</HI> near to which Kirk runs
the memorable <HI>Anderwick,</HI> a rapid River of
strong and stiff Streams; whose fertil Banks re|fresh
the Borderer, and whose Fords, if well
examined, are Arguments sufficient to convince
the Angler of Trout; as are her Deeps, when
consulted, the noble Race and Treasure of Sal|mon;
or remonstrate his Ignorance in the Art
<PB N="111" REF="77">
of Angling. Besides this <HI>Anderwick,</HI> there are
many other small Rivulets that glide up and
down these solitary Parts, omitted in this Para|graph,
because not having time to insert them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>This travelling State (<HI>Arnoldus</HI>) reminds
me of the old Proverb (viz.) <HI>A rolling Stone
gathers no Moss, nor we any Money;</HI> which runs
somewhat parallel. But it's all one in time, for
time must be untim'd in the Cusp of Eternity;
then shall we be found in an Eternal state: and
as Eternity is infinite in it self, so is it the Ray
of the Majesty of God, who created the Heavens,
the Elements and Orbs; and gave unto them
perpetual Motion and Rotation, predestinated
to the Ends of Time, unmeasurable by any
except himself. Whilst thus contemplating
what's Sacred and Divine, we trace along the
gliding Streams of <HI>Anderwick,</HI> guarded with
Trees, and knotty Rocks; as delightful and
pleasant, for ought I know, as were the myrtle
Groves, so sonneted by Poets.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I am of your Opinion in that, so I
suppose you'r of mine in this, that though Sin
untune the Strings of the Soul, yet Sin cannot
unstring the Soul; the Faculties are left still,
though in such disorder, that all the Wit of
Man can no more tune them, than the Strings
of an untun'd Lute can dispose themselves for
Harmony, without a skilful Musician's Hand.
By this we know God governs the World, who
also rules in the Heart of Man, and makes it a
Temple for the Holy Ghost. So let us pass on
with our travelling Design (by the House of <HI>Car|drus</HI>)
to the Ports of <HI>Sterling;</HI> where stands a
beautiful and imbellished Castle, elevated on
<PB N="112" REF="78">
the Precipice of an impregnable Rock, that
commands the Vallies, (as well as the Town)
and all those habitable Parts about it: those are
the Turrets that present before us, let us enter
her Ports, both strong and spacious; whose in|circling
Arms surround a City, (but not a
great one) that's built all with Stone; so is her
Castle; and situated close by the River <HI>Firth,</HI>
as above explain'd, upon lofty, craggy, and
mountanous Rocks, almost inaccessable. More
Southward yet the City spreads it self into ma|ny
sweet Situations, that invigorate the Inha|bitants,
and accommodate the Low-land Mer|chant
rather than the Mariner with profitable
Returns from the Hills, by the Highlander.
The <HI>Firth</HI> runs here that washeth and melts the
Foundations of the City, but relieves the Coun|try
with her plenty of Salmon; where the
Burgo-masters (as in many other parts of <HI>Scot|land</HI>)
are compell'd to reinforce an ancient
Statute, that commands all Masters and others,
not to force nor compel any Servant, or an
Apprentice, to feed upon Salmon more than
thrice a Week.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is there such a Law in force now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes sure, for ought I know it remains
to this Day: and the Reason of it is, as I con|ceive,
from the plenty of Salmon in these Nor|thern
Parts; that should the Inhabitants daily
feed upon them, they would inevitably endanger
their Health, if not their Lives, by Surfeiting;
for the abundance of Salmon hereabouts in these
Parts is hardly to be credited. And the
Reader I fancy will be of my Perswasion, when
he comes to consider that the price of a Salmon
<PB N="113" REF="78">
formerly exceeded the value of Sixpence Ster|ling,
which I suppose no English Man will
grudg, nor think it unreasonable to give at any
time; so that the Danger, in my Opinion, lies
most in the Diet: for as Salmon is a Fish very
apt to surfeit, more especially fresh Salmon,
when only boiled; which if too frequently fed
on, relaxes the Belly, and makes the Passa|ges
so slippery, that the retentive Faculties
become debilitated; so suffers the Body to be
hurried into a Flux, and sometimes into a
Fever, as pernicious as Death. Which is much
better prevented by Abstinency, than to stand
the Test of uncorrected Physick.</P>
<P>This famous <HI>Firth</HI> is the most portable River
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> whose Streams because meandring,
make it deep and torpid; so fit it for Na|vigation:
for below Bridg there are neither
Streams nor Sharps: but above Bridg there's
enough, more especially towards the flourish|ing
Fields of <HI>Montieth;</HI> which I rather prefer,
than <HI>Alan</HI> and <HI>Althrwery,</HI> for the Anglers Di|version,
except <HI>Frith</HI> and <HI>Koak;</HI> the one for
Pearl, but the other for Trout.</P>

<P>What Town is this?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dirty <HI>Dumblain;</HI> let us pass by it, and
not cumber our Discourse with so inconsidera|ble
a Corporation: our itch after <HI>Mockeny</HI> puts
a Spur to quicken our Expectation: for who
knows but the various alteration of Weather
may in some measure frustrate those Expecta|tions
we may have of those admirable Streams
to answer our Designs?</P>

<P>Do what you please.</P>

<PB N="114" REF="79">
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly I think it but Time lost, to sur|vey
the Reliques of a ruinous heap of Stones,
that lean o're the Verge of a River, facing the
Mountains. The Houses it's true are built with
Stone, but then to consider them low and lit|tle,
it plainly demonstrates there's nothing emi|nent
but narrow Streets, and dirty Houses; a
convincing Argument there's no Scavengers
amongst them. And for their Houswifery, let
that alone; for if you touch it, you sully your
Fingers. There is a Market-place, such an
one as it is; but as for Merchants, there's no
such thing in Nature: But a Palace there is,
and a Cathedral too, otherwise <HI>Dumblain</HI> had
nothing to boast of.</P>
<P>But there is one thing remarkable, and that's
the House of <HI>Domine <UNCLEAR>Caudwel</UNCLEAR></HI> (a formal Peda|gogue)
that absolv'd the Thief, and conceal'd the
Theft, so lost his Breeches: for you must
know the good Woman his Wife was a nota|ble
Comer, one of the first Magnitude; who
with two more of her Consorts (as I was told
at a Four-hours drinking) guzled down as much
Ale and Brandy, Wine and strong Waters as
amounted to the Sum of forty Pound Scots.
But wanting Money to pay her Reckoning, she
liberally pawned her Husbands Breeches; and
he like a Fop to redeem his Wife's Reputation,
would never redeem his Breeches, lest suspecting
they should smell of the Tears of the Tankerd.
And here, as reported, was celebrated that fa|mous
Union of <HI>Doh</HI> and <HI>Doris,</HI> stark Love and
Kindness, a Custom inviolable. Here also re|sided
jovial <HI>Bille Sinclear.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="79">
Now you are to consider, that this pittiful
<UNCLEAR>pedling</UNCLEAR> Corporation of <HI>Dumblain,</HI> has little or
no Trade amongst them, except now and then
a truck with a Brandy-Man, a Tobacco Mer|chant,
or a Brewster-wife; for Ale, Tobacco
and strong Waters are the Staple of the Town:
And so let us leave them to pursue our intend|ed
design for <HI>Minever,</HI> and <HI>Dromon</HI>-Castle, that
stands distant about some three Miles from
the Bridg of <HI>Ardoh;</HI> where there runs a small
Rivulet of a rapid Motion, paved with a slaty
Bottom; but the Access difficult.</P>
<P>And here we cross the Moor to <HI>Mockeny,</HI>
whose limpid Streams are pleasant beyond Re|port,
and her Fords generally furnished with
Trout, as if Nature had there designed to en|tertain
the Contemplative Angler, in those li|beral
Streams: where the Artist in a storm may
shelter himself under shady Trees, elevated
upon <UNCLEAR>lofty</UNCLEAR> Mountains, over the melting amo|rous
smiling Banks; as if the Boughs were Bar|nicles,
and ready to drop into the silent glit|tering
Streams, that glide softly along a delight|ful
Meadow; excepting here and there some
small Cataracts of Water that tumble down a
Precipice of Rocks, that encircles and sur|rounds
great Stones in the sandy Foundation of
this mystical <HI>Mockeny;</HI> whose glittering Sholes
are gently moved by the soft breathings of <HI>Ze|phyrus,</HI>
that dash the smaller Waves a Shore,
and discover to the Angler the intricate An|gles
of <HI>Mockeny;</HI> so that here we assume a Po|etick
Liberty, in some sort to call <HI>Scotland,
Arcadia.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is a pretty Romantick Notion.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="116" REF="80">
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Call it what you will, you will find it so,
when you come but a Mile below the Bridg,
over which we must pass from <HI>Dromon</HI> to <HI>Tille|barn;</HI>
there you'l see a large and spacious Rock,
that surrounds the Water on every side, so
makes a Dam near the Stern of a Mill, on the
Skirts of <HI>Mockeny;</HI> where swiftly, yet sweet|ly,
the Water glides along those knotty craggy
Torrs and Cliffs, till at last ariving at an asto|nishing
Precipice; where dilating it self, yet
as if unwilling to be divided, on a sudden you
shall see such Trepidations on the Surface, as if
the Streams were sensible to apprehend a Fear;
and Waters not separate without Grief at part|ing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you begin to be Metaphorical.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's no Metaphor in't. Have not you
seen burdened Clouds embodied with the Trea|sures
of Rain, ready to distil? if so, then look
on the top of that craggy Mountain, and there
you may see, as if the Waters by a prophetick
Foresight had foreknowledg of a disjunction,
exprest by their melting Drops: Nay, the
Rocks themselves are heard to murmur, and
the very Winds to whisper Rebellion. This is
the place of those harmonious Descants, which
I fancy musical, and syrenical charming Notes
betwixt <HI>Neptune</HI> and <HI>Aeolus.</HI> So that I'm of
Opinion Waters make Musick; and he that
doubts it, let him Angle for Anchovies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely you fetch'd this Notion a great
way from Home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's no matter where I fetch'd it, it's
here now. This natural Precipice shall evi|dence
for me, at the Sun's Declination, when
<PB N="117" REF="80">
he shades his Beams in <HI>Thetis</HI> Lap, and the
purple Pavilion of Night overspreads the Cre|ation;
then you may see a chequered rocky
Pavement emboss'd like the Firmament, with
spangled Stars; where those elevated Waters
(Emblems of Clouds) no sooner approach this
natural Precipice, but <HI>Boreas</HI> bustles to curl the
softned Streams, with such surly Salutes as force
a separation, so makes obvious Discoveries of
Nature's Artifice, so naturally delineated, that
the more ingenious Observer would conclude
it Artificial. Over which Precipice the Wa|ters
pass with a swift, but silent Motion to a
Cristaline Fountain guarded with Rocks, and
the Ornament of Trees; at whose descent
runs a Rivulet, that divides a Medow wor|thy
a Description, could we but describe
it, by reason of the Variety it naturally af|fords.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am still in the dark. What mean all
these Metaphors?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will know the meaning of them by
and by. Look up to those solitary Mountains,
situated South, and you shall see them send a
pleasant Smile towards the North. Yet be|cause
wanting the beautiful Ornament of Trees,
a Sheep in a Shower cannot shelter her self.
But on the North side, there stands inaccessible
Torrs, with Cliffs and Rocks well burdened with
Timber, resembling, as to my Fancy, a Her|mit's
Cell; or a solitary Reception for the Rosy-Crucian.
But Nature (and not the Native)
appropriates them to other Uses, where a Coun|try
seems barren of so great Devotion, I had
almost said Charity, but some will say Huma|nity;
<PB N="118" REF="81">
however these Holes serve the Foxes to
earth in, the Rivers for Fish, and the Otter to
swim in; the Meadows and Pastures for Sheep
to graze in; the Trees reception for innocent
Birds, and the Shrub Protection for the timo|rous
Hare.</P>

<P>So it is, in this Angle of <HI>Scotland;</HI> for
<HI>Dromon</HI> lies just at the foot of the <HI>Highlands,</HI> sur|rounded
with Woods of Fir, Ash and Elm;
but Sycomores grow here to an amazing big|ness,
whose spreading Arms shade the Soil a|bout
them; and their Bole and Brisk burden
the Earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What else is there here remarkable?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Rills, Rivers, Loughs and Rivulets
that meander not far from <HI>Dromon.</HI> And <HI>Lead|nock,</HI>
as I take it, is the first small Rivulet, and
<HI>Rothwel</HI> the next; both of them furnished with
delicate small Trout. But continuing our
Course, we advance to <HI>Lough Ern;</HI> immerg'd
with Moors and Mountains, yet it floats on the
Skirts of the <HI>Highlands:</HI> From whence rusheth
forth a violet Torrent, whose boistrous Streams
are suddenly converted into a River, which
bears the Name of the <HI>Lough:</HI> whose Streams,
if well examined, are never unfurnished with
Trout, nor are her more solid Deeps unaccom|modated
with the Race of Salmon, besides
Pike, and Perch; and for Silver-bellied Eels,
<HI>Scotland</HI> has none better; nor do I believe any
part of the World has. So that the River <HI>Ern,</HI>
<PB N="120" REF="82">
for variety and choice of Fish, is inferiour to
no other River in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now you say something to purpose;
pray go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here we must cross some of these Fords,
if we intend to touch at <HI>Lough Minever,</HI> whose
flourishing Deeps charm the Angler, and en|chant
the Fish. Nay, I must tell you, that this
<HI>Lough Minever</HI> is plentifully stored with Pike,
that contributes to the Artist, the largest <HI>Lucit</HI>
in <HI>Scotland;</HI> on the Skirts of whose rotten Foun|dations,
there remain as yet the Reliques of
an antient Castle, but so tatter'd and torn, and
o're-grown with Age, that nothing is left on it
now worthy a Description; nay, probably in
its flourishing Times there was but little to de|scribe.</P>
<P>A little more than a Mile from this <HI>Lough
Minever,</HI> and nearer yet to the Body of the
<HI>Highlands, Lough Torret</HI> tumbles down her ra|pid
Streams that melt into a River, and is cal|led
<HI>Glen-Torret;</HI> because, as I suppose, having
its Original from the <HI>Glen,</HI> and the craggy Clifts
and Tors to which it is espoused, where the
Angler may accommodate himself with Eel and
Trout: But for more Varieties, he must fish
somewhere else. Beneath the Descents of <HI>Tor|ret,</HI>
are the swelling Banks of <HI>Kelthy,</HI> in whose
rocky Bowels the Trouts shine yellow.</P>
<P>Distant yet more North, and inclining West,
beyond this craggy <HI>Kelthy,</HI> there runs a Rivu|let
which the Natives call <HI>Shaggy,</HI> the only Ri|vulet
in <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Contemplative Angler;
not only by reason of the great quantity of
<PB N="121" REF="82">
Trout it contains; nor is it because it's so nar|rowly
begirt with delightful Hills and flourish|ing
Trees, that hang dangling about them; nor
is it because of her rocky Mountains, through
which the Waters continually issue, and tum|ble
down like the Cataracts of <HI>Nile,</HI> though
they make not such a Noise; but here it was
that I found my self surrounded with Foun|tains,
and mellifluous Aviaries of sweet singing
Birds that melted the Air. And here it was
above the Kirk of <HI>Moinee,</HI> where methought I
only envied the rude Inhabitants, because so
happily bless'd with such sweet Accommodati|ons.
But below this Kirk of <HI>Moinee</HI> stands a
tottering Bridg, and below the Bridg there's a
most pleasant Level, where the sparkling Sands
seem gilded with glittering Streams: And the
River so naturally fretted and beautified
with Stone, as if Nature intended there also
to compensare the Contemplative Angler.
Here also the Trouts shine with a glittering
Blackness, and swell with Thickness; yet ne|ver
arrive to that magnitude of Proportion,
as to parallel and vie with those in <HI>Pitloyl.</HI></P>
<P>More South from <HI>Moinee,</HI> runs the River
<HI>Almont,</HI> a Derivative from the Mountains, and
not from the rotten and spungy Foundations of
the Moors, through which it glides: Nor has
it any Claim or Title from the Lough <HI>Minever,</HI>
as superstitiously surmiz'd by the unintelligible
Inhabitant. Now besides this <HI>Almont,</HI> there's
not another River or Rivulet hereabouts worth
our mentioning, except the <HI>Poe,</HI> in whose lit|tle
Pools there are Perch and Pike, and now
and then a lusty Trout. But I had almost for|got
<PB N="122" REF="83">
the Lough called <HI>Balloh,</HI> at the Foot of
<HI>Drumon,</HI> wherein there is Perch, but not a
Trout; and truly I question if there be a
Pike.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>O <HI>Arnoldus,</HI> who could ever have ima|gined
such charming Temptations amongst a
People so unpolished in Art, and a Country
without Cultivation? Here's all Miracle of
Rivers and Rivulets, and as miraculously fur|nished
with Fish. What shall I say, or what
shall I think, if not to contemplate these soli|tary
Fields, as pleasant and delightful as Fools
Paradise, by Fondlings called <HI>Elizium?</HI> Who
can deny himself such diverting Associates,
(though in a rude part of a Country) when
their Rivers and Rivulets are so liberally fur|nished
with Trout? What pity is it to leave
such Entertainments behind us, to ramble the
remote Northern Tracts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> where the
Eves e're long will hang with Icikles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>It may be so, for here we cannot stay to
inhabit, nor any longer enjoy these solitary Re|creations;
we must steer our Course by the
North Pole, and relinquish those flourishing
Fields of <HI>Kintire</HI> and <HI>Innerary;</HI> the pleasant
Bounds of Marquess <HI>Argile,</HI> which very few
English-men have made discovery of, to inform
us of the Glory of the Western Highlands, en|rich'd
with Grain, of the the plenty of Herbage.
But how the Highlander will vindicate <HI>Bowhider</HI>
and <HI><UNCLEAR>Lohabbor</UNCLEAR>,</HI> with <HI>Reven</HI> in <HI>Badanoch,</HI> that I
know not; for there they live like Lairds, and
die like Loons, hating to work, and no Cre|dit
to borrow, they make Depredations, so
rob their Neighbours. But let not <HI>Kintire,</HI> like
<PB N="123" REF="83">

<P>Why to <HI>Tippermore,</HI> is there any thing re|markable
there?</P>

<P>Yes, There's this Remark as a Monu|ment,
(fatal to the Covenanters) for here again
it was that Marquess <HI>Montross</HI> routed his Coun|try-men.
But our next Stage is to the Town
of St. <HI>Iohnston</HI>'s (very little different from those
Imbellishments of <HI>Sterling</HI>); East from the
Town lie those flourishing Meadows they call the
<HI>Ince,</HI> where a Citadel was erected and sur|rounded
by the Navigable <HI>Tay,</HI> (that washes
those Sandy Banks and Shores) which no sooner
mingles her Streams with <HI>Dundee,</HI> but she lo|seth
her Name by espousing with the Ocean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this the River <HI>Tay,</HI> so much discours'd
by the Highlanders?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have reason to discourse it, for it
leads into the Hills: Moreover, it supplies them,
as all the Inhabitants hereabouts, with fresh
Fish, to whom she contributes all her Accom|modations.
Now over this <HI>Tay,</HI> at the North
end of the Town, there stood a stone Bridg
that leads to <HI>Kennule;</HI> a mountanous Place that
tantaliz'd the Taylor with an invisible Stone:
it's a pleasant Story, but I'm unwilling to tell
it, lest fearing to draw the Maleson of the Na|tives
upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never trouble your self with that; was
it my Task, I should venture a Relation freely,
with all the Circumstances, whatever came on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I dread their Clamour as little as
any body; therefore I'le proceed, and tell you
the Story. In this Town of St. <HI>Iohnstons</HI> liv'd
<PB N="124" REF="84">
a pragmatical Taylor, (as Taylors you know
for the most part are) but here they call a
Taylor <HI>Master-fahioner</HI> for sooth, and that you
must know makes him one step higher. But to
the Story; This infatuated Taylor, with some
other idle Coxcombs, in all respects as conceit|ed
as himself, went on a certain time to these
Mountains of <HI>Kennule,</HI> to search thereabouts for
an invisible Stone, that accidentally slipt from
a stranger's Hand, as he carelessly rid along to
view the Country. This strange Accident
made a horrible Noise all here about; and all
diligence possible was used by the Taylor and
his nitty Companions to find this Stone; yet
the Stone was invisible.</P>
<P>Now amongst the rest of our Admirers, the
Lady of <HI>Kennule</HI> entertains the Novel; and re|solves
an adventure for the invisible Stone, who
with her Female Attendants several times sur|rounded
the Hills, and stooped to take up eve|ry
shining Stone; so that for the most part they
were always in Motion, except at other times
upon the removal of Stones, with <HI>Responses</HI> to
one another in the Scotish Dialect. I see ye,
see ye me, till almost every Body see them all.
So asham'd at length to prosecute the Design
any farther, (since stretch'd so far, it was ready
to break) despairing of their Enterprize, and
the recovery of the Stone, they left their Suc|cesses
to the indefatigable Taylor, and his
prickear'd Crew; that Day after Day so hound|ed
these Hills, as hitherto no Church-yard
has been haunted with Goblins.</P>
<P>But on a certain Sun-shiny Day (in the Even|ing)
as some Townsmen were returning from
<PB N="125" REF="84">
the Ports of <HI>Dundee,</HI> and espying the Taylor
inspecting the Stones, one of these Towns|men
(I'le warrant him a Wag) dismounts from
his Horse, having dealt with his Companions
to take him to Town: who the better to
manage his contriv'd Design, and put a Trick
upon the nitty Taylor, kept at a distance be|hind
him; till at length he calls aloud, as the
Lady and her Women had formerly done. I
see ye, see ye me. But the Taylor on a sudden,
because seemingly surpriz'd, replies, <HI>in fa Sir I
tro I see ye.</HI> However, the Townsman pretends
to be serious, (and the rather, because seeing
the Taylor all alone) till at length the Taylor
concludes him in Earnest. So that now being
freed from Suspicion on both sides, they jog on
together (like <HI>Tory</HI> and <HI>Trimmer</HI>) the uneaven
Tracts of these mountainous Ascents; till the
Taylor stooping to take up a Stone, and con|fidently
bleating aloud to the Townsman; I
see ye Sir, see ye me? In gude fa Sir, no, the
Townsman replied; where are you won Sir I
can no see ye? I am here, quo the Taylor, and
can ye no see me? I would you were any where
the Townsman replied, so that I could but tell
where to find ye; And smiling to himself looks
another way; then repeats it again, But whar
shall I find ye?</P>
<P>Now for certain, quo the Taylor, I have got
the Stone, by which means, beyond measure,
I'le inrich my self, for I have tryed all ways to
do it without a Court of Conscience. How
many People have sought for this Treasure,
but no Man so happy as my self to find it? I
may go where I will, for no Man can see me;
<PB N="126" REF="85">
and stand where I please, for no Man can find
me; and take what I list, (for Taylors are
thievish) and no Man detect me; and if Fear
affrights me, yet no Man can hurt me. To con|vince
the World therefore, and Mankind in
general of this rare and admirable invisible
Stone, I'le strip off my Clothes and go stark
naked through the Streets of the Town, and
so mist all the Eyes of the People about me, that
no Body shall see me, nor any Body know me.
Know you, says the Townsman, no Body can
see you; then how should they know you. Say
you so, quo the Taylor; can no Body see me?
No, says the Townsman, since you made your
self invisible. Why then, quo the Taylor, I
may do what I will, and go where I list, and
no Man the wiser. So you may, says the Towns|man,
since now you'r Invisible. But favour me
I beseech you this small Request, that before we
depart I may once again see you.</P>
<P>With that the proud Taylor transported with
Joy, discharged both his Hands, and laid down
the Stones. Which his subtile Associate no soon|er
observes, but presently he cries aloud, Now
Sir I see you. And more to strengthen and
confirm the Miracle, on a sudden the Taylor
snatch'd up the Stones again, lest fearing his
Companion should by some Trick deprive him;
and fancying himself, as formerly, invisible, they
both advance towards the Town of St. <HI>Iohn|ston</HI>'s.
But the Taylor went naked, who no
sooner entred the Ports of the Town, but the
Mob and the Rabble having combined together
to pelt the poor Taylor into his Senses, if pos|sible,
who run the Gantelop through Thick and
<PB N="127" REF="85">
Thin, Young and Old, for every Boy had a
switch at his Breech; and those at a distance that
could not reach him, assaulted him with Stones;
which so claw'd the poor Taylor, as by the
marks on his Buttocks, conviced him at last
to believe himself Visible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think the Taylor met with his Match.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>So think I, if he was not overmatch'd.
And so let's leave him to lick himself whole,
whilst we return to the Bridg of the Town of
St. <HI>Iohnston</HI>'s, where a Coker-Boat serves now
to transport their Merchandize into the County
of <HI>Angus,</HI> and some other Parts; which looks
somewhat odly, but it concerns not us, for we
can't redress it; those that are compell'd may
suffer by it. So let her sleep the Sleep of Ob|livion,
whilst we direct our Course towards
the River <HI>Errit,</HI> where we may inform our selves
of a Practice amongst the Natives there, that
murder a Salmon without a Rod, Net, or
Speer; and cook him almost as soon as they
catch him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can that be? pray unfold the
Riddle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's discours'd by every Body, when a
Stranger comes amongst them, that the Inhabi|tants
presently run and fetch a Pot, which they
circumspectly place upon some part of a Rock,
and then dextrously convey some live Coals
under it, (or it may be Turf) which is no soon|er
fan'd by the Breath of Air, but immediately
the Flames fly all about. Now you are to con|sider
that the Race of Salmon, especially the
Female in the Vernon Aequinox, is for the most
part picking and casting against the rapid
<PB N="128" REF="86">
And in this River <HI>Errit</HI> it's always observable,
there are plenty of stumpy knotty Rocks, to
which the Native, without difficulty, can pass
and repass from one Rock to another; and the
rather to facilitate this mortal Design, they set
the Pot on some seeming floating Rock, to
which (as I am told) their Observation directs
them; which Rock, it may be, is almost drown'd
in Water. Now this Artifice is no sooner per|form'd
by the rude Engineer, but the Salmon,
because casting after her usual manner, often
casts away her Life, by leaping into the Pot in|stead
of the Pool.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot approve of this murdering Ar|tifice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor I neither; but the manner of Action
is thus performed. For the Salmon you must
know, by reason of agility of Body, (and con|siderable
Strength) so bends and contracts her
self, by taking her Tail (as suppos'd) in her
Teeth; then, like a well-tempered Spring that
suddenly and smartly unbends and flies off;
even so doth the Salmon with a strange Dex|terity,
mount the Air (out of the Water) an
incredible height; But because unprecautioned
how to distinguish the Elements, and perhaps
wanting foresight of this imminent Danger, she
frequently encounters the boiling Water, which
no sooner she touches, but her Life is snatch'd
away by the suffocating Fumes, that immedi|ately
strangle her; and thus the poor Salmon
becomes a Prey to the Native, when only in
the pursuit of Nature's Dictates, whose Laws and
Rules are circumscrib'd and bounded by the So|veraignty
of him that made the Creation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="129" REF="86">
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>This I must needs say is a barbarous
Practice, but a quick way of Cookery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Such kind of Cookery will serve a Scots
Commoner, as lives on the Bray and Skirts of
the <HI>Highlands.</HI> But we relinquish these pleasant
Streams of <HI>Errit,</HI> to patrole the Fields of <HI>Cooper</HI>
in <HI>Angus,</HI> where <HI>Scotland</HI>'s great General (the
Earl of <HI>Leven</HI>) was born promiscously of ob|scure
Parents. In this little Corporation of
<HI>Cooper</HI> in <HI>Angus,</HI> the chief Magistrate is a Bay|liff,
Master sometimes of a Brewster-house;
where we may refresh our selves, before we
trample the Sands of <HI>Ilay,</HI> imbellished with
Rocks, and lofty Trees that shade her shining
murmuring Streams, and shelter her numerous
Sholes of Fish, especially towards her Source:
where you may observe the Shores shine of a
golden Colour, resembling the glittering Sands
of <HI>Tagus.</HI> And the River <HI>Dean</HI> so fam'd for
Pike (though unfortunate for Trout) gulphs in|to
<HI>Ilay</HI> near <HI>Mighill</HI>-bridg.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What place is this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Old <HI>Drumkelbo,</HI> an ancient supernnuated
Castle, that adjoins to a certain Moor called
<HI>Tipprosin;</HI> which in my Opinion resembles the
<HI>Stygean</HI> Lake, (rather than the <HI>Elizium</HI> Fields)
whose solitary Bounds are large and spacious,
mossy and boggy, full of Pits and horrid Black|ness;
a Resemblance (to my fancy) of the Courts
of Death.</P>
<P>Now this <HI>Tipprofin</HI> got its Name from an un|fortunate
Priest, that travelling those unfre|quented
Tracts, accidentally fell into a Mossy
Moorish, Boggy Pit; which sudden Disaster sur|priz'd
the Priest, and the rather, because, when
<PB N="130" REF="87">
to see himself plung'd into the Arms of Death,
without any prospect of timely relief, this
made the poor Priest unlock the doors of his
Lips, that like double Diapazons unlock'd the
Air sooner than the Ears of the obdurate Na|tive,
that inhabited the Verge of this solitary
Moor. So that by this time finding his Com|plaints
insuccessful, only the repetition of his
dolorous Cries from reverberating Rocks and
Cavities of Earth, it stirr'd up a sorrowful Si|lence
in the Priest, which at last led him into a
profound Contemplation; fancying to himself
he liv'd now in his Grave, and every Object a
<HI>Caput Mortuum.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Priest, I perceive, was in a very bad
Pickle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And so would you, had you been in his
Case; but this Meditation no sooner expires,
when the Bogs and Moors ecchoe again with
such hideous Shouts, and dismal Cries from the
terrified Priest, as if some Evistre or Appari|tion
had presented before him the horrible and
terrible Apprehensions of Death: but it hap|ned
otherwise (and it's well it did) for some
Natives and Inhabitants of the Fields in <HI>Angus</HI>
(were breaking of Earth, and digging for
Turf) who hearing a Noise, and an imperfect
Sound, as they thought, breathing from the
Bowels of the Earth, it dreadfully startled them
at first: but after some time, deliberating a|mong
themselves, and resolving, if possible, to
sum up the Cause of these horrible Cries; their
Ears were a second time assaulted, by a fresh
supply of miserable Lamentations that sprung
from the repeated Complaints of the poor
<PB N="131" REF="87">
pensive Priest, who was almost come to a Peri|od,
and winding up the Bottoms of his dolo|rous
Howlings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the Priest, I hope, got relief at last,
who it may be till then had forgot how to pray.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You cannot forbear jerking the Priest,
who by this time seem'd destitute of all moral
Comforts, and as little hopes of Relief, not|withstanding
his breathings forth of a formal
Penance, lamenting his unfortunate, unlucky
Mischance, that threatned his <HI>Exit,</HI> if no more
Priests in <HI>Scotland.</HI> So in a fainting Fit, he faint|ly
cries out with an articulate Voice, because
his Breath began now to expire, which certain|ly
had in a very short time extinguished, had
not the Inhabitants pursued the Ecchoes to that
dismal Pit where the Priest lay bogg'd; im|ploring
the Deity, with Eyes and Hands held
up towards Heaven, using these and the like
Expressions, <HI>Ex profunditatibus te inclamavi,
Iehova.</HI> And though the People understood
not his Latin, yet their Lenity and common
Charity, with other requisite Endeavours,
brought him Relief, and hal'd him sorth out of
his formidable Confinement. Since which re|markable
Time, to this very Day, the Natives
and Inhabitants that inhabit thereabouts, do
call this Moor by the Name of <HI>Tipprofin.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then it seems he christned the Moor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>And you seem here to christen the Priest,
for the Priest gave Name to the Moor of <HI>Tip|profin;</HI>
and the Witches (if there be such) gave
name to <HI>Pitloil:</HI> as if Priestcraft and Witch|craft
were inseparable Companions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's amiss now at the Lough of <HI>Pitloil?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="132" REF="88">
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall have it when I can come at it,
and that won't be long first. South and by East
from these mountanous Elevations, we discover
two large and spacious Loughs; the one of
them is called by the Name of <HI>Loundy;</HI> but the
other Lough is called <HI>Pitloil,</HI> divided from each
other by an Isthmus of Land, or the interpositi|on
of a small Mountain. I frequented them
both to fish for Perch, because to my Expe|rience
the largest in <HI>Scotland,</HI> if twenty Inches
and better can be thought a large Perch: and
having to my Curiosity examined them apart,
more especially <HI>Pitloil,</HI> I declare it as my Opini|on
from several Examinations (and approved
Experiments) that both of them super-abound
with plenty of Perch; which infinitely aug|ments
the Angler's Entertainments: Nor do the
Waters mingle one with another, when each
of them find a different Passage, to discharge
themselves into the Streams of <HI>Tay.</HI> But in
this Narrative I thought requisite to inform
you, that <HI>Lundy</HI> exceeds by much in plenty,
though <HI>Pitloil</HI> to a Miracle exceeds in large|ness.</P>
<P>But <HI>Van Helmont</HI> tells you, in <HI>Fol.</HI> 684.
That in the Lake of <HI>Lemane,</HI> a Trout doth of|tentimes
ascend unto an hundred pound Weight.
And the Natives that inhabit this solitary Part
of <HI>Angus,</HI> will tell you of Trouts of such vast
Dimensions, that I dare not report without be|ing
suspected; so render my self and Relation
ridiculous. A Trout also was taken in the
River at <HI>Ware,</HI> and presented to <HI>Charles</HI> the First,
then King of <HI>England,</HI> which Trout was of
such a vast Proportion, as would seem incre|dible
<PB N="133" REF="88">
for me to report; which for any Man's
satisfaction the Figure of it as yet remains (for
ought I know) at the <HI>George</HI>-Inn in <HI>Ware,</HI> to
convince the Incredulous, if any be suspicious.</P>
<P>A Pike also <HI>Van Helmont</HI> tells of, that a Sign
hung on him is noted to have lived three hun|dred
Years, and to have grown to an amazing
Bigness; nor then to have died, but by a vio|Ient
Death. Great Pikes I have also observ'd
to be taken out of the Lough of <HI>Minever,</HI> that
have measured more than a Yard and a half;
and such were surprized with a Hook and Line.
So in the Rivers of <HI>Lire</HI> (nigh the Village
<HI>Rumst</HI>) an Eel was taken, which was sent to
<HI>Bruxels,</HI> unto the Emperour <HI>Charles</HI> the First;
which was observed to have been seventeen Foot
in Length.</P>
<P>Another notable Relation I have from a
Gentleman, born in <HI>Nottingham-shire;</HI> his Name
is <HI>Armstrong,</HI> whose Grandfather very much af|fected
the Rod: and Trolling in some River
there-abouts, but whether in <HI>Trent</HI> or the River
<HI>Soar,</HI> he remembers not; however he encoun|tred
a lusty Pike that disarm'd him, both of his
Hook and his Hopes at once: so melancholy he
left off his Recreation for that time, but the
ensuing Day presented an occasion for our Ang|ler
to travel; and as his Custom was, after
dispatch of Business, he mingled some solitary
Recreation with his Employment. So steering
his Course to the Water-side, and viewing the
Fords, he observes a Shole of Fish fly to the
Shallows for Sanctuary; by which he imagined
the Fry was assaulted: so that presently near the
Deeps, he lets his Bait drop; which unex|pectedly
<PB N="134" REF="89">
was suddenly encountred; and he like
an Artist, gave his Examinant the Law of fair
Play, so destroyed his Assailant: and having
by this time landed his Adventure, he present|ly
goes about to discharge his Arming, but
reaching forth his Hand to disgorge his Captive,
he becomes suddenly surpriz'd, because then
to find in the late conquered Fish, not only one
Hook, but another also; which he certainly
knew to be his own, that but the Day before
was forced away from him; which after exa|mination,
he found it was. Now this Fish was
observed to have travelled fifteen Miles in twen|ty
four Hours. For that end I offer this dis|course,
that the travelling Fish never arrives to
that maturity of Growth, as does the Fish that
is idle and slothful; for by how much his Mo|tion
is in the River, by so much the better and
more nutritious is the Fish.</P>
<P>Now that Witches inhabit near this Lough
of <HI>Pitloil,</HI> I am of Opinion, provided there be
any. But whether there be, or be not, such mor|tal
Demons, I suspend my Judgment, and pro|ceed
to the Adventure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I long to hear it, and you are loth to
come at it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have patience but a little, and you shall
have it. Early one Morning (before the Sun
had adorned the Day with his beautiful Beam of
Light to gild the azure Firmament) I set for|ward,
as at other times, to this fatal Lough of
<HI>Pitloil;</HI> and riding along, observ'd a large and
lusty Hare (but they call her <HI><UNCLEAR>Maukin</UNCLEAR></HI>) sitting
upon a large and gritty Stone, washing and fur|bishing
her Face with her Feet; and on the
<PB N="135" REF="89">
bought of her near Buttock (as to my Obser|vation)
was branded a remarkable Patch of an
obscure blackish Colour, altogether different
from the rest of her Fur; which appeared to
the bigness of a five Shilling piece of new mint|ed
Silver: but dismounting my Horse, she dis|covered
me approach her with my Greyhound-Bitch,
which I suddenly slipt; and she as sud|denly
forsook her Station, but trusted so little
to the nimbleness of her Heels, as if her Life
was but of little Value. On the other hand,
my Bitch was so slow in her Motion, as if they
had mutually combined not to hurt one another.
So leaving that pursuit to pursue my first Inten|tion,
I left the Mountains to trace Vallies to
this unfortunate Lough of <HI>Pitloil;</HI> for what hap|ned
afterwards will commission me, I question
not, so to intitle it: where I found my Grey|hound
Bitch, but no Fur in her Mouth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What of all this? pray be brief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'le be as concise as I can. That very
time, I remember, a Peer of the Realm went
(with me) in Company, to this Lough of <HI>Pitloil,</HI>
to which place, when we arrived, and dismount|ing
our Horses, to imprint our Feet on the Sil|ver
Sands, (it's a liberty I assume to call them so,
in regard of their glittering Whiteness) and
searching for the Boat, we found it was remo|ved
into a more remote and solitary part of
the Lough: so we sent some Attendants to seek
for the Man that rowed the Boat; nor were
they long in their Inquisitions before they found
him, as they unluckily passed by the Doors of
some ill contriv'd Huts, or obscure Caves, that
resembled Dungeons rather than habitable
<PB N="136" REF="90">
Houses; where sometimes he usually reposed
himself, there, or thereabouts, because in ex|pectation
that some or other would come that
Day to visit the Lough: which happened ac|cordingly
to his apprehension.</P>
<P>Now by that time our Attendants were come
up with those Female Infernals that inhabited
those Hutts, and enquiring for the Skipper to
pilot the Boat, he makes himself known, that
he was the Man that paddled in the Pool with a
bad and crazy weather-beaten Boat. So they
desired him to hasten away, with such Tools
and instruments as he had to assist their Design.
To all which he readily seemed to comply
with, in hopes of a Gratuity which he after|wards
obtained. But before they departed from
those ugly Earth-holes, an ill-contrived Urchin,
or a Cur out of shape, and deform'd, (as they
described him) but we call him a <HI>Tarrier,</HI> and
they by the Name of a <HI>Whitwratch,</HI> (bastard|brood
of the Fox) as the Servants apprehend|ed;
so might any Man as well as they rationally
conclude, as by the Circumstances given us by
their Description.</P>
<P>A beautiful Spannel I had at that time (pro|pined
me by the Lady of an eminent Peer) fol|lowed
after the Horsemen; which the Elph in
pursuit of, had fastned on him, but was sud|denly
rescued by my Greyhound-Bitch (for|merly
discoursed) and peradventure with some
small detriment to this ugly Elph: Which when
the Hag had enviously observed, she hastned
in the Elph, and suddenly after was heard to
express unsavory words, very Diabolical, with
Charms and Threats; besides various antick
<PB N="137" REF="90">
Gestures and Postures, both with her Head and
Body; that at present occasioned abundance of
Laughter among them; as it did after their de|parture
from those sordid infernal Huts or
Habitations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>We shall have something on't by and by
I perceive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doubt it not; for no sooner the Boat
touched the Sands, but as soon I committed my
Person to the Lough, as calm and as smooth as
a Sea of Glass; and so it continued, till the
Sun's advance to climb the Meridian: but af|terwards,
my fortunate Success became unsuc|cessful,
for after his Declination the Scene was
changed; and then my Labours prov'd all
Abortive, for the beautiful prospect of my
Morning's Diversion, was changed and clowd|ed
with tragical Conclusions. It's true, I went
ashore to refresh my self, in regard a cold Ca|pon,
and some other good Provision was pro|vided
for me, and this Noble man's Refreshment;
who sat down with me under the Shades of
Rocks, not far from the Brink of this Lough of
<HI>Pitloil:</HI> where we both Eat and Drank together,
till finding our selves sufficiently refresh'd; and
then I arose, and took leave of this Honoura|ble
Peer; so returned to the Boat again, to
steer my former Course; as also to observe what
interest the Lough would now afford me for
those Hooks and Lines I left behind me.</P>
<P>But no sooner I had committed my self to the
Boat, and rowed to the Place where I left my
Tackle, but on a sudden, and unexpectedly, I
was interrupted by the loud Acclamations of
some on Shore, that shouted and made Signals,
<PB N="138" REF="91">
by beck of Hand, (because by this time I was
almost out of distance) advising my return:
Which I no sooner interpreted, but hastned to
the Shore as fast as I could; for by their seem|ing
disorder, as I then apprehended, some un|expected
Accident had hapned amongst them.
So that I forcibly forced my Passage through
the thickest Waves; and being by this time ar|rived
on Shore, I was entertained with the un|welcome
News of my Land-spaniel's Indisposi|tion;
but too late I found to rescue him from
Death. So reflecting on my self, that Begin|nings
have Conclusions, I directed my Steps
back again to the Boat, to recover my armed
Tackle left behind, on purpose to surprize such
Fish as were shame-fac'd to bite before me.</P>
<P>Now this was the third Time I entred the
Boat, in order to pursue my Angling Enter|prize:
when a fresh Summons alarms me from
the ecchoing Shores, to come back and testify
another strange Accident, not inferiour to the
former; because to stand by as an Evidence,
and see my Greyhound-Bitch lie a dying; whom
I presently found as stiff as a Stake, (or a
Stump) whilst as yet her Body was as warm as
Wool: nor could I say she was totally Dead,
yet I'm sure she was altogether depriv'd of Mo|tion.
So I hastned from the Morts, and re|turned
to the Lough, to draw up my Lines
which I left behind me; and though having met
with too such fatal discouraging Accidents (with
solicitations from this Honourable Person) I
pursued my first Intention; so brought off my
Lines, and left the Lough in a foming Rage;
and now you shall hear what hapned on Shore.
<PB N="139" REF="91">
Not far from this Lough, stood a small Moun|tain,
whereon some Inhabitants had built a Kiln;
to which Place we directed a Servant for Fire,
that presently brought it, but we hardly knew
the use on't, before the Kiln was all in Flames;
and burnt so vehemently, that in a short space
the whole Fabrick was consum'd and burnt
down to the Ground: So I left my Recreation,
and took my leave of the unfortunate <HI>Pit|loil.</HI></P>
<P>And now give me leave to return to <HI>Drumkel|bo</HI>-Castle,
and tho but ill contrived, and as ill
situated, in regard it stands near to the Moor of
<HI>Tipprofin;</HI> yet not far from thence are the flou|rishing
Fields of <HI>Mighill,</HI> beautified and adorned
with stately Sycomores; as are her Meadows
surrounded with Rivers and Rivulets. In the
midst of whose Plains stands a Parochial Church,
wherein lies interr'd the Royal Corps of King
<HI>Arthur</HI>'s Consort; with the Reliques of some
other weather-beaten Monuments that Age has
almost blotted out; but the Queen's Tomb I
observed was surrounded with Martialists, that
when living so, in Death paid Homage at her
Princely Sepulchre.</P>
<P>These are those cultivated Fields of <HI>Mighill,</HI>
where King <HI>Arthur</HI>'s Stone stands to this very
Day. It's true, because Traditional among
the Antiquaries, and why not as true because a
Superstition amongst the Inhabitants, who will
tell you with as much Confidence as they
mumble their <HI>Pater Noster,</HI> or with as much Im|pudence
as you can credit with ignorance, that
that very Stone was King <HI>Arthur</HI>'s Table, when
his Royal Campaign encamp'd in those Fields;
<PB N="140" REF="92">
which he left behind him as a Relique to Poste|rity?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Or rather because he could not take it
with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will have your Joke, I perceive;
however I'le proceed to the pleasant Banks of
<HI>Ilay,</HI> where the Angler, without difficulty, may
take a view of a large and spacious River of
translucid Streams; where a Storm seldom in|vades
the Shores, nor any immoderate Winds
much to incommode them, in regard the Wa|ter
runs most on a level, and the Banks very
blough; more especially when attempting the
Head of <HI>Reven,</HI> where the Angler may observe
most rapid Falls and stiff Streams, which are
seldom or never unaccommodated with Trout,
besides the generous Race of Salmon, the Na|ture
of whose Sex and Species (this Opportuni|ty
presenting) invites me to discover a most
admirable Secret.</P>
<P>For as I was angling one time on a Sun-shiny
Day, in these limpid and transparent Streams of
<HI>Ilay,</HI> I was constrained, in regard of the excessive
Heat, to relinquish her inflam'd sandy Shores,
to seek Umbrage (where I could get it) from
some shady Trees: but none I found there to
harbour and relieve me. However, by this
time, I recovered a Meadow, which generously
commoded me with a Hauthorn-bush that Na|ture
had planted by the River side (which ser|ved
me for Sanctuary) whose dilating Boughs,
spreading as an Umbrella, they defended me
from the scorching Strokes of the Sun, where
also I lay closely conceal'd, the better to inspect
Nature's Curiosities.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="92">
For whilst reposing my self under this tiffany
Shade of diversified Leaves and flourishing
Twigs, that hovered over the Brinks of this
amorous <HI>Ilay;</HI> on a sudden I discovered a very
large Salmon, leisurely swimming towards the
Leeward-Shore: and having considered the Sun
at his Meridian, I thought it needless to pro|voke
her with Fly, or any thing else, more espe|cially
at such a time when I knew her indisposed
to divert her self either with Food or Fro|lick.
Where note, the more circumspectly I
traced her with my Eye to pursue her, the
more and greater still was my Admiration, be|cause
to mark her from Place to Place, till at
last I saw her arrive on a Bed of Sand, which
scarcely to my apprehension, covered her with
Water; for I am confident it exceeded not the
depth of one Foot; where with her Tail she
rigled to and fro, so long and oft, till I visibly
discovered a flat slaty blewish Stone; over which
she oft-times contracted her Body; Nature
provoking her to eject her Belly, which at last
she accomplish'd, to my surprizing Amaze|ment.</P>
<P>But this was not all; for as soon as that Pro|ject
was performed by the Female, with most
accurate Swiftness, she lanched her self forth
into the more solid Deeps; which was no soon|er
performed, when as suddenly I recovered the
view of another, as afterwards will appear by
the following Circumstances: For out of that
solitary and profound Depth of Water, where|in
the Female had concealed her self, there
sprung up a Male (or something like him) that
swam directly as if hal'd with a Cord, to
<PB N="142" REF="93">
that very Place where the former Fish had
ejected her Belly, (but some call it Spawn) and
there performed such an admirable Office, as
you will hardly believe, though I tell you the
Truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, this is remarkable, pray let us
have it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Female I have told you, has shot her
Belly upon a large and blewish slaty Stone; and
the Male, as by instinct to discharge his Office,
dilates his Fins, and futters about, till at last he
directs himself over the ejected Matter; where
with his Nose, as I then apprehended (though
I will not warrant Fish to have a Scent) rooted
as a Swine, or something like it, yet were the
Waters at that time undisturbed; when on a
sudden, and with a violent motion of Body,
he throws himself about, invading the Calms
with such a strong Ebulition, as if some pon|drous
Stone had struck the Surface: but it was
not long e're I see him again, though for the
present he seem'd to me invisible.</P>
<P>And then my Observation led me curiously to
observe him direct his Head to the former Place,
and contract himself after the same manner
which the former Fish had formerly done.
This I visibly and plainly saw; which, together
with his active and exerting Motion, a sper|matick
Whiteness of a milky Substance issued
from him, not much unlike to jellied Cream:
All which Remarks I signally notified, and by
all the Circumstances my Judgment could direct
to, I concluded him the Milter, because there
to shed and scatter his Milt upon the ejected
forementioned Belly; which with my Eyes I
<PB N="143" REF="93">
then beheld, and visibly saw; and therefore
take the boldness confidently so to report it.
Believe it that will, refute it that can; I know
no better Evidence than Eye-sight. But lest
any Man, through Obstinacy, or a vain Incre|dulity,
arraign the Truth of this my Observa|tion;
I'le direct him a Precedent, and go no
farther than the Brood of Perch, because both
are barrel-bellied Fish; and answerable in some
measure to the Race of Salmon; which if he
do, he may rationally conclude that Nature's
Laws are alike to both.</P>
<P>Now the Milter, because having discharged
himself with some little Labour, and as little
Trouble, suddenly recovers again the Depth
of the Water, with most accurate swiftness;
nor have I rarely seen a more violent Motion:
whose absence in a trice invites the Female Fish,
and she no sooner returns to the Place, dictated
beyond dispute by the Mediums of Nature
(which I think no wise intelligent Man will de|ny)
works a Trough like a Cistern in Sand or
Gravel, and as near as I could guess of about
her own Proportion; into which Trough with
nothing save the spring of her Tail, she jumbles
and tumbles in the <HI>prima materia,</HI> according to
<HI>Aristotle;</HI> but <HI>proxima materia,</HI> if you credit
<HI>Sandivogius;</HI> who allows, a visibility of the
second Matter, but not of the first: so gently
she cover'd it over with Sand, and then left it
to the great Luminaries for Vivification, and
the Seminals, because having a prolifick Vir|tue,
and Life-quality innated in them. Life
inevitably shines forth after certain Days, Ac|cidents
omitted; because the Lustre of Life is
<PB N="144" REF="94">
a thing so sacred, that the Lubeck of Conspi|racy
strikes to blot it out. Thus much there|fore
as relates to the Progeny of Salmon, I being
an Eye Witness, do boldly testify; and as bold|ly
divulge; if Seeing be a good Basis for any
Man's belief. And this I believe, and confi|dently
assert, and therefore report it to the
World for a Truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>O how rare and admirable are the Se|crets
of Nature; who useth no Engine nor Ar|tificial

seem Prodigies in Nature; but this, as if beyond
her, surpasseth admiration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nature made naked is nothign but Won|der,
and <HI>Scotland</HI> is a Kingdom and Country of
Prodigies. Look forward and behold that
tott'ring Bridg, we must pass over it to the
Town of <HI>Eliot,</HI> a small Country-Village, one
would think it dropt out of the Skirts of the
<HI>Highlands.</HI> And this is the Town where fa|mous
<HI>Leven (Scotland</HI>'s great General) was sur|priz'd
in his Quarters by the English Cavalry.
Not far from this Bridg of <HI>Reven,</HI> the Streams
being translucid, you may see under Water ir|regular
Rocks, and knotty broken stumps of
Trees, that stand in the Streams of famous <HI>Ilay.</HI>
Where the swiftness of the Current under|mines
the Sand, and delves great Pits that secure
the Salmon from the Sentence of Death, except
such as are destinated to die by the Decrees of
Age, or their own extravagant Prodigality, in
pursuit sometimes after fictitious Novelties; as
when they relinquish the Rocks in a Bravado,
to challenge Death by a different Fortune. For
then is the Time the prejudicate Native con|sults
<PB N="145" REF="94">
his Opportunity to put in execution that
barbarous Practice of murdering Fish by Moon|shine,

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, are these Canabals, or murdering
Moss-troopers, to surprize Fish by the Engine
of Fire-light? Such dark Conspirators sprung

or some infernal <HI>Incubus.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are those amorous Banks of <HI>Ilay,</HI>
so famously extoll'd for Diversion; for in those
solitary Streams you see before you, by industry
of Art, and dexterity of the Rod, I have had
Trouts come ashore, and leap in my Hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's by reason they could leap no
where else; But how far have we now to the
Bridg of <HI>Dean,</HI> discours'd every where for the
plenty of Trouts? and if Fame be a true Ora|cle,
they tumble up and down there, till the
Artist pleases to exchange their Element, and
court them ashore by force of Arms.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's the Place, near those glittering
Sands, and rocky Foundations; where you may
observe the trembling Streams swiftly, yet
sweetly glide along; but not as Cataracts to
terrify the Fish, by reason their Fall is so gently
moderated, amongst those knotty stumpy Rocks.
I call it a River enrich'd with Inhabitants;
where Rocks are Landlords, and Trouts Te|nants.
For here's not a Stream but it's fur|nished
with Trouts; I have angled them over
from Stem to Stern, and drag'd them forth
Brace after Brace, with nothing but a Hackle,
or an Artificial Fly, adapted to the Season, and
proportioned to the Life. Humor but the Fish,
<PB N="146" REF="95">
and you have his Life; and that's as much as
you can promise your self. O the Diversion I
have had in these solitary Streams! believe me,
<HI>Theophilus,</HI> it surpasseth Report. I remember
on a Time, when the Clouds let fall some extra|vagant
Drops, which in a manner discoloured the
Surface of the Water, then it was that amongst
those stony Cisterns, where you see the Tops
of the Rocks make a visible discovery, a little
above that trembling Stream, if you mind it;
there stands a stumpy craggy Rock, peeping
perceptibly out of the Water. From thence,
and above those slaty Foundations, I have struck,
and killed many a Brace of brave Trouts; a
Reward beyond my Labour and Expence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I question it not; but what's here, the
Arcanum of Angling?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes sure, and the Treasure lies in those
trembling Streams that come tumbling down
to wash the Cheeks of those pallid Rocks; from
whence they gently glide along with generous
Dews, to moisten the florid marly Banks; and
tinged as you may see with a Rubido, they
strike a vivid Tincture into the flourishing
Streams: and thus the Complexion of the Wa|ter
was changed, (once upon a Time) when I
fished those Streams, where the Trouts, to di|vert
me, and augment my Entertainment, came
ashore to court me; and courteous beyond cu|riosity,
laid their Lives in my Hand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they gave you handsel I perceive
but this is some <HI>Aenigma,</HI> pray explain it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's no more an <HI>Aenigma</HI> than a Trout is
a Trout; for you must suppose him an active
Fish, who no sooner finds himself intangled, but
<PB N="147" REF="95">
he plunges, and breaks the Surface of the
Streams, thinking thereby to disintangle him|self,
and reprieve himself from the danger of
Death, that already has laid an Arrest upon
him. Thus by picking and casting, he casts his
Life away; so swims ashore to hear the Ang|ler's
Doom, in whose Breast lies the Sentence of
Life and Death. On a certain solitary and
gloomy Day, the Face of the Firmament was
sullied with Clouds, that roll'd to and fro, but
did not melt. I remember I armed with a glit|tering
Fly, the Body composed of red twisted
Silk, intermingled with Silver, and an Eye of
Gold, the Water in temper (as you now ob|serve
it) but the wing of my Fly was the dapple
Feather of a Teal; the Day, as prenoted, pro|miscuous
and gloomy; and the Clouds, as I told
you, stained with blackness; but no noise of
Thunder disturb'd the Air, nor was there any
Symptom or appearance of Rain, save only
some sprinkling scattering Drops that trickled
down the marly Banks, and moistned the Cheeks
of the craggy Rocks; so amalgamizing the mol|lified
Earth with Water (to my Observation)
invited the Fish from their Habitations; inso|much
that the Streams were not Charms strong
enough to contain them, for in Frolicks, as I
apprehended, they made haste to meet me; and
that was as much as to complement Death: but
the Landing, I confess, was difficult enough, by
reason of Distance, and the hazardous Passages
I frequently encountred, because of Rocks;
which with difficulty I evaded. But that I need
not recount, when only designing to recite the
executive Part of Angling, in order to which
<PB N="148" REF="96">
my ensuing Discourse will instruct you in the
Art, and in the mystical Intrigues of the Ang|ler
also.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ingenious Instructions will signalize the
Art easy, and impregnate the Artist. Let the
Luxurious furfieit with the Sins of the Age, I'le
trace the Angler's Footsteps, and pursue this in|offensive
Life, and silver Streams, to propagate
and cultivate the Art; so compleat my self an
Artist in this mystical Artillery: for I can raise
my Ambition no higher than the Device, Fashi|on,
and Form of Flies; with Advice also for
their management, together with seasonable
Time and Use.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was my Intention, had you never
mentioned it: but were it to another, I should
rather refer him to our modern Assertors. For
indeed the frequent exercise of Fly-fishing,
though painful, yet it's delightful; more espe|cially
when managed by the Methods of Art, and
the practical Rules and Mediums of Artists.
But the Ground-bait was of old the general
Practice, and beyond dispute brought conside|rable
Profit; which hapned in those Days,
when the Curiosity of Fly-fishing was intricate
and unpracticable. However <HI>Isaac Walton</HI> (late
Author of <HI>the Compleat Angler</HI>) has imposed up|on
the World this monthly Novelty, which
he understood not himself; but stuffs his Book
with Morals from <HI>Dubravius</HI> and others, not
giving us one Precedent of his own practical
Experiments, except otherwise where he pre|fers
the Trencher before the Troling-rod;
who lays the stress of his Arguments upon other
Mens Observations, wherewith he stuffs his indi|gested
<PB N="149" REF="96">
<HI>Octavo;</HI> so brings himself under the Ang|ler's
Censure, and the common Calamity of a
Plagiary, to be pitied (poor Man) for his loss
of Time, in scribling and transcribing other
Mens Notions. These are the Drones that rob
the Hive, yet flatter the Bees they bring them
Honey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember the Book, but you inculcate
his <HI>Erratas:</HI> however it may pass Muster among
common Mudlers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, I think not; for I remember in
<HI>Stafford,</HI> I urged his own Argument upon him,
that Pickerel weed of it self breeds Pickerel.
Which Question was no sooner stated, but he
transmits himself to his Authority, viz. <HI>Gesner,
Dubravius,</HI> and <HI>Androvanus.</HI> Which I readily
opposed, and offered my reasons to prove the
contrary; asserting, that Pickerels have been
fished out of Pools and Ponds where that Weed
(for ought I knew) never grew since the Non|age
of Time, nor Pickerel ever known to have
shed their Spawn there. This I propounded
from a rational Conjecture of the Heronshaw,
who to commode her self with the Fry of Fish,
because in a great measure part of her Main|tenance,
probably might lap some Spawn a|bout
her Legs, in regard adhering to the Segs
and Bull-rushes, near the Shallows, where the
Fish shed their Spawn; as my self and others
without curiosity have observed. And this
slimy Substance adhering to her Legs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
she mounting the Air for another Station, in
probability mounts with her. Where note, the
next Pond she happily arrives at, possibly she
may leave the Spawn behind her, which my
<PB N="150" REF="97">
<HI>Compleat Angler</HI> no sooner deliberated, but
drop'd his Argument, and leaves <HI>Gesner</HI> to de|fend
it; so huff'd away: which rendred him
rather a formal Opinionist, than a reform'd
and practical Artist, because to celebrate such
antiquated Records, whereby to maintain such
an improbable Assertion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>This was to the Point, I confess; pray
go on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>In his Book intituled the <HI>Compleat Angler,</HI>
you may read there of various and diversified
Colours, as also the Forms and Proportions of
Flies. Where, poor Man, he perplexes him|self
to rally and scrape together such a parcel
of Fragments, which he fancies Arguments con|vincing
enough to instruct the Adult and Mi|nority
of Youth, into the slender Margin of his
uncultivated Art, never made practicable by
himself I'm convinc'd. Where note, the true
Character of an industrious Angler, more de|servedly
falls upon <HI>Merril</HI> and <HI>Faulkner;</HI> or ra|ther
upon <HI>Isaac Owldham,</HI> a Man that fish'd Sal|mon
but with three Hairs at Hook; whose
Collections and Experiments were lost with
himself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>That was pity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it was, but to thee <HI>Theophilus</HI> so well
improved, if Salmon or Trout be your Recre|ation;
remember always to carry your Dub|bing-Bag
about you; wherein there ought to
be Silks of all sorts, Threads, Thrums, Moc|cado-ends,
and Cruels of all sizes, and variety
of Colours; diversified and stained Wool, with
Dogs and Bears Hair; besides twisted fine
Threads of Gold and Silver: with Feathers
<PB N="151" REF="97">
from the Capon, Partridg, Peacock, Pheasant,
<UNCLEAR>Mallard</UNCLEAR>, Smith, Teal, Snite, Parrot, Heronshaw;
Paraketta, Bittern, Hobby, Phlimingo, or In|dian-flush:
but the Mockaw, without excepti|on,
gives flames of Life to the Hackle. Thus
arm'd at all Points, with Rods Rush-grown,
Hooks well temper'd, and Lines well tapered,
you may practise where you please in any Ri|ver
in <HI>Scotland;</HI> provided always the Season
be sutable. And forget not be sure to purdue
your Distance, always taking the Head of a
Stream, and leisurely fish downwards; lest your
Game discover you, and flie before you.</P>
<P>Another Observation, is the various Change
and Complexion of the Water, occasioned
sometimes by immoderate Gluts, intemperate
and violent Gluts of Rain, Issues of Land|floods,
Soil and Silt from off the Shores. These
and the like Observations ought to be the con|sideration
of every Ingenious and Practical Ang|ler.
And this is the proper Season to exercise
with the Ground-bait; for should any Man, un|der
the pretence of an Artist, remain destitute
of these prenoted Qualifications, proclaim him
a Block-head; let him angle for Oisters.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what must we do when the Fords are
discoloured?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have already told you, that the Ground|bait
then is most profitable for Diversion. But
imagine it like this adapted for Fly. Observe
those Insects, and flender Emits that accost the
Streams and bubling Fords; not doubting, but
with Diligence, you may easily surprize them;
which if it succeed not to your Intention, tra|verse
with your Eye those Landskips of Rocks,
<PB N="152" REF="98">
that at a distance lie buried almost under Wa|ter;
or from those knotty Brows of broken
Banks, that stand within distance; otherwise
clap close down on some Flat or Level, which
equals the surface of the gliding Streams:
where it behoves you to condescend and stoop
sometimes to your Knee, or it may be closer
Order, if need so require; always observing
the hovering Fly that flutters aloft to allure the
Fish, how wantonly he sports himself with
Death, when to court a familiarity with that
that destroys him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what if this Design prove Abor|tive?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must then clap down beneath some
Rock, or you may shelter your self in the Ca|vities
of Earth: so with curious Inspection, and
diligent Observation, the brightness or the
gloominess of the Day considered, fashion your
Device according to Art; considering the ge|neral
Cure for Proportion, as also the Season,
by the Rule of Contraries. For the brighter
the Day is, the obscurer your Fly; but the
more promiscuous the Season is, by so much the
more ought your Fly to be bright and shining.
I also advise you to prepare the Ground and
Body of your Fly with Bears-hair, as at other
times from the obscurities of Wool; but then
let the Head be obscure and dark, since gene|rally
most Flies their Heads are blackish. The
Wing also you may strip from the Pinion of a
Teal, which above measure allures the Trout to
destruction. But if Novelties affect, as fre|quently
they do, you must then consult your
Flies to excel one another, if provided you de|sign
<PB N="153" REF="98">
to advance your Recreation. But presup|posing
the Day be gloomy, as frequently it
happens from melancholy Clouds&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's then to be done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must then consult a brighter Fly,
which is better understood upon serious Pra|ctice;
for I extol no Man a Proficient in the
Art, that is undisciplined in the Academy of
Experience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>But some Men I observe are more Ingeni|ous
than othersome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Otherwise I should allot them an acci|dental
Fate: for convinc'd by observation, I
am easily perswaded that some Artists gain Ex|perience
with little Difficulty; when as other|some
acquire it not without great Industry:
for where natural Endowments accommodate
the highest Form in Arts, their Theory and
Practicks seldom justle for precendency. Thus
the Day and the Season always considered, the
Artist, I fancy, may sport at leisure, provided
he design Angling his Recreation.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are there no <HI>Mediums</HI> set down as a
Standard in the Art?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes surely there are, but considering
your Capacity, it will add but little to those
Instructions. However I'le discover another
notable Secret, though less practicable, yet pro|bably
more advantagious than adventuring a Fly
according to Fashion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray unriddle the Mystery; it's some
<HI>Aenigma</HI> I fancy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Paradox explained; First take a
Trout, rip up his Belly, and examine his Maw
to see what remains unconcocted; and if it be
<PB N="154" REF="99">
in Fly-time, you will find some there; for he
loves to insinuate himself among Insects, (for
Flies are Insects) and are upon the main the
Matter he preys on. Procrastinate no Time,
for the Digestions are swift; be quick therefore,
and you will find some there; and as near to the
natural Form as your Ingenuity admits of, con|trive
such another in Figure and Proportion,
which without delay, make an Experiment by
spreading the Streams with your Artillery: and
if it answer not what in reason you expect,
take the freedom to proclaim me no Projector.
But be cautious and circumspect in all your Ap|proaches,
and be dextrous and diligent when
and how you strike. Fish by direction, but put
no Force upon your Exercise; so that when you
observe your Game advance, and raise himself
to encounter his Prey, fix diligently one Eye
to attend his Motion and keep the other on
the Point of your Rod; avoiding all silly and
foolish Circumstances; only remember to an|swer
a Foot exactly with that Hand that reach|eth
forward, beginning always at the Head of
a Stream, and so patrole to parsue your Game
downwards; otherwise you may confidently as|sure
your self, the Fish becomes Fugitive, so flies
before you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall mind your Directions, and pursue
your Instructions.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, I'le proceed. A calm Air
you know prognosticks a Cessation of Winds;
and a Breez being wanting to furl the Deeps,
by what Art will you contrive to raise a Trout
in a deep, torpid, and solitary River? Mind
what is said; be sure you stand close, and pru|dently
<PB N="155" REF="99">
conceal your self behind some Rock, or
some shady Bush: then, with the hazard of
nothing but a Drack, which if not attainable,
then search out some other natural Fly, and
dibble be sure lightly on the Surface of the
Deeps, you raise him beyond dispute, and as
certainly kill him; for this natural Novel has
no Compeer; and the Artificial is but the Re|presentation.
Where note, the green Drack
pleads the precedency, then the Gray; the for|mer
from the issue or product of a Codworm;
but the latter as to observation proceeds from
the Straw-bait.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very significant and proper Distin|ction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now besides close Order, great Curiosi|ty
is requisite in Tackle: for the more accurate
the Artist is, by so much the more will the Art
be express'd. For that end, let your Rod be
shap'd Like a Rush, the line exactly tapered;
your Hooks well tempered, and as well compas|sed;
not too stiff, nor yet too pliant; their
Points well drawn out, and as sharp as Needles,
but their Birbs as stiff and as strunt as Bristles;
the Wing of your Fly also well flourishd, and
well pinion'd; and so snug as to carry the Point
always downward. These are necessary Ob|servations
in Trout-fishing; more especially to
the Contemplative and Ingenious Artist, rather
than to those Paper-scull'd Buffoons, devoid of
Reason, and as indigent of Patience, as the
Man that hang'd himself, because the Hangman
was not ready; that confront the Art, because
Fish won't meet them half-way ashore, and leap
into their Laps before they come near the Water|side;
<PB N="156" REF="100">
where you may see them stand like so ma|ny
Star-gazers, gazing on the Fish, and the
Surface of the Streams; whose Aspect, if pos|sible,
would terrify a Grampus, that seldom or
never satisfies their Appetite, till their avarici|ous
Desires have victualed the Pannier.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>These Mudlers shall never merit the Ti|tle
of Anglers, nor their Arguments a better
Reputation than Affronts; Mercenary Slaves,
that murder all they meet with, and hunt like
Otters to accommodate the Paunch.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus our Discourse of the River <HI>Dean</HI>
has diverted us to the Fields on the North of
<HI>Reven,</HI> which indeed was a considerable part of
my Design; because I might not only be said
to convince you, but use you as an Argument to
convince others, that the Trouts in these solita|ry
Streams, are for Largeness, Beauty, Size and
Proportion, nothing inferior to any in <HI>Scot|land;</HI>
and such have I hal'd out of these pur|ling
Pits, with nothing save only a natural
Fly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the Day declining, what becomes of
us now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why now we must relinquish these rol|ling
Streams, and those pleasant flourishing
Fields of <HI>Reven</HI> that direct to <HI>Ingleston,</HI> and the
Antiquities of <HI>Castleton,</HI> formerly inhabited by
the English Martialists: But <HI>Castleton</HI> you must
consider was only a Fort, and <HI>Ingleston</HI> (as I am
told) their assigned Locality. Distant some two
Miles from these Weather-beaten Reliques,
stands the House of <HI>Glames,</HI> and the fair <HI>Fene|ven,</HI>
situated amongst Rivulets. More Norward
yet we advance upon <HI>Forfar,</HI> where we may ex|pect
<PB N="157" REF="100">
as good Entertainment as the Country is
capable of; and that is good enough, since
Eating and Drinking is not the main of our
Design: but there stands the Town of <HI>Forfar,</HI>
tell me what you think on't?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it's a Town; what would you
make on't?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not only a Town, but a Corporation
too, how're you approve on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I approve on't well enough, Where lies
the Objection? here's nothing that I see pre|sents
uncomely: But how goes the Story of the
good Man's Cow? and what became of the
Old Wife's Liquor?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I matter not much if I give you the Re|lation,
as neatly drest up as the Circumstances
will bear; for there was, I'le assure you, a
very hardy Adventure, hapned betwixt the
Brewster Wife, and <HI>Puggy</HI> the Cow of <HI>Billie
Pringle.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray let us have it, I grow impatient to
hear it; I'le remark the Beginning, and dili|gently
attend the Conclusion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I'le begin. Once upon a Time
(for so I was told) within the Walls of this
little Corporation of <HI>Forfar,</HI> there lived an
ancient Brewster Wife, more eminent in her
Art for brewing of good Ale, than all the
Brewsters that lived about her; who upon oc|casion
of some Solemnity, had boiled up a Caul|dron
of stinging Stuff, to hum the Noses of some
jolly good Fellows, that by Country-Custom
and Rules of their own, had made an Appoint|ment
to meet there to Morrow; which they
punctually performed, but were all disap|pointed,
<PB N="158" REF="101">
because not to meet with what they
came there for.</P>
<P>Now you are to consider the Custom of the
Country, which in short was this. No sooner
the Alewife brews her Ale, but presently she
exposeth it to the open Air, in certain Vessels
which the People call <HI>Coolers,</HI> (always provided
it do not Rain) though not so much to mode|rate
the Heat of the Liquor, as to ripen and
prepare it for a present Draught; which they
fancy it does, and Fancy you must know surpas|seth
Beauty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very good, pray go on; I fancy we shall
have a pleasant Story.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>But so it hapned, that <HI>Moggy</HI> her Maid,
was the Person appointed to attend this Liquor;
whilst the guid awd Wife was cumbring her sen
to deft her House, and put it into Order. Now
the careless Lass steps casually aside, (whose
absence was not long) when by accident &amp; most
unfortunately a deep-wem'd Cow of jolly <HI>Billy
Pringles</HI> came stragling that way; who assail'd
the Liquor, nor could she well help it; be|cause
when so provoked by the alluring Steem,
that sent a Summons to her voracious Appe|tite:
and the poor Cow as if invaded by some
feverish Indisposition, and because knowing
no Law of Limitation, seem'd wholly uncapa|ble
to satisfy her self, so long as any Ale was
left in the Cooler; for she drank, and puff'd,
and then took Wind, and too't again, so long,
and so oft, till at last she surveyed the Dimen|sions
of the Tub, where the Liquor in a short
time was almost consumed; which any Man
of Sense might rationally conclude so, because
<PB N="159" REF="101">
the Cow could not see her Face in the Bot|tom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>But here lies the Question, whether or
no the Cow's natural Draught was so large an
Allowance? or what unnatural Spark of Heat
had then occasioned such immoderate Exceed|ings?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess I neglected to examine that
Circumstance; but this I remember, and every
one can tell you, because so remarkable, it can
never be forgot, that the Cow when examining
the smoothness of the Ale, and finding it, as
I conceive, moderated to her Temper, without
a Coag she drank all off: which no sooner hap|ned,
but presently in a rage comes out the awd
Wife that brewed the Ale, and troubled beyond
measure at the loss of her Liquor; besides, it
touch'd, as she thought, her Reputation, be|cause
to disappoint the jovial Crew that had
celebrated that Day to solemniate <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and
observing how the Cow stood puffing and blow|ing,
and her Ale as concluded past all discove|ry,
grows immediately Horn-mad; so lets
fly at the Cow, by thundring on the Ribs and
the Sides of the Beast, with a formidable Basti|nado,
or a good Oak Sapling, like <HI>Iohn</HI> at the
Giant; who became extream angry, because
that the Giant would not run away from him.</P>
<P>At length comes <HI>Billy Pringle</HI> that owned the
Cow; and he forsooth, like an Advocate, useth
Arguments to pacify and moderate the awd
Wife, against such violent and immoderate
Proceeds; which nothing availed, for she gave
him the hearing, and that was all. But stand|ing
a while to recover fresh Breath, she pre|sently
<PB N="160" REF="102">
lets fly at the Cow again, by redoubling
her Blows on the Sides of the Beast, till at last
the awd Wife became as weary with cudgel|ing,
as the insensible poor Cow was at that
time with fudling; whose Sides were already so
stuff'd with strong Ale, that made her Proof a|gainst
the awd Wife's Artillery; which so inca|pacitated
the Cow for flight, nay I might as well
have said, not almost, but altogether uncapa|ble
of Motion.</P>
<P>All this while <HI>Billy Pringle</HI> he labours in vain;
and though no Provost, nor Laird of a Manour,
yet was he forsooth a venerable Commander,
who endeavours what he may to pacify the awd
Wife; but she was so inconsiderate, nothing bal|lances
her Passion; his Arguments, she inter|prets
them all Affronts; and his Pacifications
but Inducements to aggravate her Revenge.
Whereupon he resolves no more Pleadings, but
to use Silence as the best Interpreter. Which
she observing, stood still a while; and though
out of Wind, and not answering a Word, yet
the Storm was not over; for no sooner she re|cruits,
and recovers fresh Breath, but lets fly at
him like <HI>George</HI> at the Dragon.</P>
<P>This rais'd such an Uproar all the Town
over, and a general Confusion among the Spe|ctators,
that now my Lord Provost displays his
Authority; who to pacify, if possible, the Bulk
of the Rabble, that were at that time all in an
Uproar, came puffing and blowing, almost out
of Breath, commanding the Peace; asking
them, If they longed to be hanged for a Riot?
Get ye Home, quo the Provost, every Man to his
House; and that quickly too, or I'le send ye
<PB N="161" REF="102">
packing. But observing the Tumult make no
haste to disperse, he commands the Peace in
their Majesties Name, whilst he lays about him
with a sturdy Oak-Saplin he had in his Hand;
telling them all the while, That if they would
not be quiet, he would make them quiet, and
keep the Peace too, and their Houses to boot.
And for your part, guid Wife (quo the Pro|vost)
seek your Remedy at Law, it's a Friend's
Advice, and the best Course you can take. And
for <HI>Billy Pringle,</HI> he may do the like. The
Words drop'd savourly from his Worship's
Mouth, so took effect.</P>
<P>And now the guid Wife arrests <HI>Billy Pringle,</HI>
because that his Cow drank off her Ale. And
he like a Man to purge himself by Law, tra|verses
the Action at the Court at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
where the Case was opened, and Pleadings on
both sides. But the Woman's Counsel pleads
hard for Satisfaction; when an Advocate for
<HI>Billy Pringle</HI> solicites the Judg, that an Award
be allowed to his Client <HI>Pringle:</HI> For, my
Lord, quo he, they produce no Precedent; nor
was it ever known in the Kingdom of <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
that a Cow paid a Plack for a standing-Drink:
nay, more than that, she never call'd
for't, and <HI>Doh</HI> and <HI>Doris</HI> is the Custom of our
Country; Where note, a standing-Drink was
never yet paid for. With these and the like
Circumstances he made the Court merry, be|cause
utterly to exceed and confound their
Practice; so that now every Lawyer became a
Mute, and every Auditor a silent Admirer.</P>
<P>During this Silence there rush'd into the
Court a crew of sawcy surly Fellows, that prof|fered
<PB N="162" REF="103">
to swear for the guid awd Wife, that the
Cow drank the Ale brewed for them to drink:
and it's thought they would have sworn through
a double Deal-board, they seem'd so enraged
for the loss of their Ale. This you must con|ceive
warm'd the Woman's Counsel, so that
they moved the Court for Satisfaction, and
prayed a more strict examination of the Mat|ter.
Upon which the Records of the Court
were called for, but no Precedent was found to
punish a Cow for drinking of Ale, sitting or
standing. Besides, it was adjudged beyond the
Practice of the Court to determine any thing
wherein the Laws were silent. Yet notwith|standing
all this, and a great deal more; the
Woman's Counsel moves again for Satisfaction,
which Proposal was quash'd by Sentence of the
Court, almost as soon as it was propounded, be|cause
to refer it to the Provost of <HI>Forfar.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you think him a Man of that Capa|city,
to decide a Controversy so foreign and
intricate, that all the Law in <HI>Scotland</HI> could not
then determine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so, was the Nature of the thing so
rare and difficult?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was it not, think you, to take all the
Proofs, to swear all the Witnesses; and as near
as possible to ultimate the Difference, with this
proviso to both Parties Satisfaction?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess it was intricate; but how did
he behave himself?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well, I fancy, and the Manner on't
was thus. First, He calls a Hall; but admits no
Man to speak a word save himself; and as his
<PB N="163" REF="103">
Gravity directs him, puts a Question to the
Woman; which in short was this. He demands
to know of her how the Cow took the Liquor,
whether she took it sitting, or if she took it stand|ing?
To which the Brewster-Wife, after a little
pause, answered, by making this reply; In guid
fa Sir, quo the Wife, the Cow took it standing.
Then, quo the Provost, your e'en words con|demn
ye, to seek Satisfaction for a standing-Drink.
This annihilates the Custom of <HI>Doh</HI>
and <HI>Doris.</HI> For truly sike another ill Precedent
as this, were enough to obliterate so famous a
Custom, as stark Love and Kindness for ever|mare.
Where note, guid Wife, ye have wrong|ed
<HI>Billy Pringle,</HI> for prosecuting the guid Man
contrary to Law; and have done mickle Da|mage
to <HI>Puggy</HI> his Cow, because to chastise her
but for a standing-Drink.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>No.</P>

<P>By what means then was she moved in|to
this small Mediterrane? I solicite Advice,

<SP>

<P>Art was both Engin and Engineer to
invite this Ship into this solitary Lough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>If so, it's strange that a Vessel of her
Force should leap out of the Ocean, and over
the Hills, to float in a Gutter surrounded with
Rocks.</P>

<P>Not so strange as true, for here she is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="168" REF="106">
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was there a possibility of her sailing
from the Citadel, to this eminent <HI>Lough Ness,</HI>
when a Boat of ten Tun can't force her Passage
half way up the River? This looks Romantick
beyond the ingenuity of Art, or possibility of
Invention.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let it look as it will look, I am sure it
was so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are sure it was so, then pray resolve
the Point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why thus it was; In the Time of War
betwixt the King and Parliament, this Navigate
Invention was consulted by Maj. General <HI>Dean;</HI>
who to compleat a Conquest over the High|landers,
(in regard hitherto the Law of a Fo|reign
Power had never bridled them) he ac|complished
this new Navigation of sailing by
Land: who contrived the transportation of this
fair Ship (that you now see) into these torpid
and slippery Streams.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, without Sails?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, without Sail, Pilot, Card or Com|pass;
by dividing only the ambient Air, as for|merly
she plowed the pondrous Ocean. Nor
was she compell'd to encounter Sea or Land in
all her Passage; which by some may be thought
a ridiculous Report. On the other hand, for a
Ship of this Burden to transport her self, or
suffer her self to be transported without ordi|nary,
nay extraordinary Means, looks like an
Impossibility; however here you find her, nor
is it to be denied that she had a Passage to this
solitary Lough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="169" REF="106">
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>First, you must conclude no Vessel, with|out
a Miracle, could remove her self so far from
Sea; and I'le assure you in this here's nothing
miraculous. Then you are to consider that so
eminent a Ship could never shove her self to
reach this Limit, as extends from the Orchean
Seas to this obscure <HI>Lough Ness,</HI> without probable
Endeavours, and very considerable Assistance.
Lastly, to admit of a violent motion, were a
kind of madness; because to impose a Contra|diction
upon the Design.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray explicate the <HI>Aenigma.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Motion must be had (that you'l grant)
and Means considerable to move by, (this you
must allow) which to accomplish, the Sailers
and the Souldiers equally contributed. For a
Regiment (or it may be two) about that time
quartered in <HI>Inverness;</HI> who by Artifice had
fastned thick Cables to her Fore-Castle, and
then they got Levers and Rollers of Timber,
which they spread at a distance, one before ano|ther;
whilst some are of Opinion these robust
Engineers framed a more artificial and politick
Contrivance: but thus it was, and no other|wise,
I'le assure you; save only they fastned
some Cheeks and Planks to the solid Sides and
Ribs of the Ship, the better to secure her from
crushing upon Transportation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did she pass in this manner as you
tell me, to this famous <HI>Ness?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, she relinquished the brinish Ocean,
to float in the slippery Arms of <HI>Ness.</HI> But to
keep her steddy in her Passage, and preserve
her from rocking and rolling by the way; they
consulted no other Project than what I tell you:
<PB N="170" REF="107">
save only some additional Supplies from <HI>Inver|ness,</HI>
that with Ropes and Takcle haled her
along to this very place where you now observe
her. For you are to consider, she no sooner
got Motion, but by Industry and Art she was
steer'd without a Compass, to this remarkable
<HI>Ness;</HI> where now she <UNCLEAR>floats</UNCLEAR> obvious enough to
every curious Observer.</P>
<P>For let me tell you, that Strength, Artifice
and Resolution, are indisputable Arguments to
reach the Possibility of any thing possible; a
threefold Cord is not easily broken. Motion
therefore was no sooner begot, but the whole
Mystery was almost accomplished; the Plover
you observe never breaks the Shell, before the
Lapwing is ready to run; nor will the Sailer
spread the Sails, until he observe a Wind pre|sents.
Nor got our Ship the Mediums of Mo|tion,
but by Argument of Force (not of Artil|lery)
which forced her by graduate Means, till
arriving in this <HI>Ness,</HI> obvious to all Men.</P>
<P>And this is that famous and renowned <HI>Lough
Ness (Loemon</HI> excepted) inferiour to none in
the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland;</HI> whose Streams are
strewed with Eel and Trout, whilst her Deeps
are saluted with the race of Salmon; whose
fertil Banks &amp; shining Sands are hourly moistned
by this small Mediterrane: which I fancy is be|sieged
with Rocks and Mountains; whilst her
polite Shores are forzen in the Winter, by the
frigid Lungs of blustring <HI>Boreas,</HI> that perplexes
her Banks, and masquerades her Rocks with a
Cristalline Hue of polished Ice. Where the
Tritons &amp; Sea-Nymphs sport themselves on the
slippery Waves, sounding an Invasion to her
<PB N="171" REF="107">
moveable Inmate; supposed by some, the
floating Island.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do these fair Mountains that interdict
the Dales, survey the forcible Streams of <HI>In|verness?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes surely, these Torrents, which you
now discover, frequently wash the Walls of
<HI>Inversness</HI> (a derivative from <HI>Lough Ness</HI>) at the
West end whereof stands a diminutive Castle,
about a Mile distant from that magnificent Cita|del,
that subjects those precarious Northern
Highlanders. This <HI>Inverness,</HI> or Model of Anti|quity
(which we now discourse) stands com|modiously
situated for a Highland Trade; de|fended
with a weather-beaten tottering Wall,
that's defaced with Age and the Corruptions of
Time, where yet there remains two Parish-Churches:
But I remember a third that was a
kind of a Cathedral or Collegiat-Church, that
now like old <HI>Troy</HI> sleeps in Dust and Ashes, as
part of the Walls do, charging Time and Neg|lect
with their tottering Decays.</P>
<P>North and by East, near the forcible Streams
of the <HI>Ness,</HI> stands the Fortress, or Pentagon,
drawn out by regular Lines, built all with Stone,
and girt about with a Graff, that commodes it
with a convenient Harbour. The Houses in
this fair Fortress are built very low, but uni|form;
and the Streets broad and spacious, with
Avenues and Intervales for drilling of Foot, or
drawing up Horse. I must confess, such and so
many are the Advantages and Conveniencies
that belong to this Citadel, it would be thought
fabulous, if but to numerate them: for that end
I refer my self to those that have inspected her
<PB N="172" REF="108">
Magazines, Providores, Harbours, Vaults,
Graffs, Bridges, Sally-Ports, Cellars, Basti|ons,
Horn-works, Redoubts, Counterscarps, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Ocular Evidence is the best Judg, and gives the
plainest demonstration; which, without dis|pute,
will interpret this formidable Fortress a
Strength Impregnable; and the Situation, as
much as any, promises Security, by reason it's
surrounded with boggy Morasses; standing in
Swamps, on an Isthmus of Land, that divides the
<HI>Ness</HI> from the Orchean Seas.</P>
<P>Yet here is one thing more among our Nor|thern
Novelties very remarkable; for here you
shall meet with a wooden Bridg to convoy you
over the rapid <HI>Ness;</HI> but certainly the weakest,
in my Opinion, that ever stradled over so strong
a Stream. However, it serves to accommodate
the Native, to those pleasant and fragrant Mea|dows,
North and North-West, that direct to
the demolishments of the Castle of <HI>Lovet,</HI> near
to which stand the Antiquities of <HI>Brawn,</HI> plan|ted
upon the brow of a considerable Bank,
that hangs, one would think, o're a spacious
River, above all in <HI>Scotland,</HI> replenished with
Salmon: whose numbers are numberless, if not
improper to say so; and careless of their Lives,
they cast them away.</P>
<P>I must confess, the strength of such strange
Reports, oftentimes meets with a foreign Faith,
that raises more Scruples than Arguments can
answer. And so it hapned to me at first, till
convinced by some Persons of considerable Re|putation,
that when the Fisher-men with their
Sanes have drawn these Streams, they have
counted many times five hundred at a Draught;
<PB N="173" REF="108">
the Truth of which Relation, should any Man
doubt of, they are ready to assert and vindicate
the Truth on't by pregnant Demonstration.
However it shaked my Credulity at first, though
possibly it may remove the Jealousy of another,
if when provided with Patience he can suspend
his suspicion till better inform'd, or confirm
himself of the plenty of Salmon in these re|mote
Northern Parts. For I grant, others
with my self of a like Perswasion may question
this Report, till convinc'd by the Truth of O|cular
Demonstration; that these Northern
Rivers are the Riches of the Country.</P>
<P>Here the Salmon relinquish the Salts, because
by the Porposses pursued up the Freshes; just
so the Shad is chased by the Sturgeon, and so
are the smaller Fry by the revenous Pike: Na|ture
directs Self-security, and nothing stands
in competition with Life. Where note, the Sal|mon
are compell'd to desert the Deeps, and
seek sanctuary from the sandy Sholes; as I my
self and others have often observed the Por|posses
pursue them in the frothy foming
Waves of the <HI>Ness,</HI> for it may be some two or
three Miles together; till their Strength impa|ring,
which oft-times compels them to court
the Shores, though with hazard of Life. And
sometimes they meet with a Precipice of Rocks
(as these at <HI>Brawn</HI>) which with an impossibility
they perpetually attempt, though to no purpose
as to Self-security.</P>
<P>This Oracle explicated, who so incredulous
to doubt or dispute the Truth of my Relation?
for no Man certainly was more averse than my
self, to affix a Credit upon a single Report: but
<PB N="174" REF="109">
when opposed by such eminent Evidence, it
forced my Obstinacy to yield a Compliance:
more especially when approaching those frothy
Streams; no other Argument then need to con|vince
me but Eye-sight. Truly I stood amaz'd
to see such Companies of Salmon in these Nor|thern
Parts; which demonstration made such
Impressions in my hesitating Breast, that now
I'm convinc'd; I am ready to publish my Con|viction
to others, upon manifest Experience.
For what can I do less than certify a Truth so
often opposed, and doubted by my Self. In this
<HI>Pontus Cambrosia</HI> (in the famous <HI>Ness</HI>) you shall
observe three Tides meet every twelve Hours:
and when they meet, by reason of their inter|changeable
Streams mingling together, make
such Convulsions and violent Eruptions, as
dam up the Shores, and make the Passage ex|ceeding
hazardous; especially for small Boats
that cross the <HI>Ness,</HI> if there do but the least <UNCLEAR>im|petuity</UNCLEAR>
of Winds hover in the Air.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is very remarkable, for the Porpos|ses
to pursue the Salmon ashore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>But so it is: besides, in the midst of
<HI>Cambrosia</HI> is a white Spumation, or a frothy fo|ming
sparkling <HI>Spry,</HI> that resembles <HI>Via lactea;</HI>
occasioned, as you see, from luxuriant Tides,
and aggravating Winds, that violently con|tract
the Surff of the Sea, and so amalgamizes
them together, that neither the one nor the o|ther
can divide, nor expatiate it self, till inevi|tably
suck'd up into the Bowels of the Ocean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy this <HI>Hellespont</HI> of <HI>Pontus Cambro|sia,</HI>
a representation of the chalky Mount in
<HI>Barbardoes;</HI> because of its polish'd glittering
Whiteness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="175" REF="109">
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember as we pass'd this hazardous
<HI>Charibdis,</HI> the Vessel that conveyed us was in
danger to overset, by reason the Porposses vent|ed
so vehemently at the Stem of our Boat, in|somuch
that one of them had almost invented
his Passage amongst us; which if he had, there
was no way but one; and that way was un|equal
to exchange of Elements. But at last
we concluded if the Boat should miscarry, to
lanch forth into the Deeps, and <HI>Hero</HI> it over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some then I fancy would have made
brave Ducks and Drakes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's no matter for that, the use of Blad|ders
had been out of Fashion. Now no sooner
we arrived at the desired Shore, but with friend|ly
Congratulations we saluted one another;
discoursing our hazardous Passage, and this
pleasant Country (or Isthmus of <UNCLEAR>Land</UNCLEAR>) besieged
with Sea; because having <HI>Portus salutis</HI> on the
North and by East; <HI>Cambrosia</HI> on the South;
and the Western parts all guarded with inacces|sible
Rocks and Mountains facing the Fields of
<HI>Stranaver.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Here's another <HI>Hellespont;</HI> must we cross
this also?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes surely, we must cross this rugged
Ferry, especially if intending the Bounds of
<HI>Innerbrachy,</HI> in the cultivated Fields in the Coun|try
of <HI>Ross;</HI> where the Rocks are undermin'd
by the Sea Quellem, that serves for a Filtre to
riddle the Ocean, and separate her saline bri|nish
Taste, from those more sweet and luscious
Fountains; where the Inhabitants will flatter
you with an absurd Opinion (an old Traditi|on
received from their Ancestors) that the
<PB N="176" REF="110">
Earth in <HI>Ross</HI> hath an antipathy against <HI>Rats,</HI>
as the Irish Oak has against the Spider: And
this Curiosity, if you please to examine, you
may, for the Natives do; but had they asserted
there were no Mice in <HI>Ross,</HI> every Tongue had
contradicted them. Now Mice and Rats are
Cousin-German, every Body knows that knows
any thing, and for the most part keep House
together: But what difference has hapned a|mongst
them here, as to make such a Feud in
this Country of <HI>Ross,</HI> that the Rats in <HI>Ross</HI>
should relinquish their Country, and give pos|session
wholly to the Mice; this is a Mystery
that I understand not.</P>
<P>Besides this fond Opinion of the Natives
hereabouts, some others more remote (as ig|norant
as themselves) transport the Earth of
<HI>Ross</HI> into most parts of <HI>Scotland;</HI> perswading
themselves, that if they do but sprinkle it in the
Fields, Fens, Moors, Mountains, Morish or
Boggy Grounds, (all is one as to that) for it al|ters
not the Property, nor does it diminish the
Quality, nor impair the Virtue, but that still
it retains a certain antipathy against that enor|mous
Vermin the Rat, nay, the very scent on't
shall force him to become an Exile. This odd
kind of Creed they had when I was resident
amongst them; yet to the best of my Observa|tion,
I never saw a Rat; nor do I remember of
any one that was with me ever did: but for
Mice, I declare, so great is their plenty; that
were they a Commodity, <HI>Scotland</HI> might boast
on't. And that they have Owls with Horns,
some favour the Report; yet are they not
Horns, but as like Horns as any thing that are
<PB N="177" REF="110">
not Horns; nor is it any other than a sort of
Feathers, that's clung'd and twisted so natu|rally
together, that represents the Idiom or
Form of a Horn, if when to observe them at a
reasonable distance, which seemingly beautifies
the Ivy-bush, as Horns adorn the Head of a
Buffulo.</P>
<P>The next Curiosity to entertain you with, is
the Country of <HI>Southerland;</HI> which we enter by
crossing a small Arm of the Ocean from <HI>Tain</HI> to
<HI>Dornoch.</HI> So from thence we travel into <HI>Cath|ness,</HI>
and the Country of <HI>Stranavar;</HI> where a
rude sort of Inhabitants dwell, (almost as bar|barous
as <HI>Canibals</HI>) who when they kill a Beast,
boil him in his Hide, make a Caldron of his
Skin, Browis of his Bowels, Drink of his Blood,
and Bread and Meat of his Carcase. Since few
or none amongst them hitherto have as yet
understood any better Rules or Methods of
eating. More North in an Angle of <HI>Cathness,</HI>
lives <HI>Iohn a Groat,</HI> upon an Isthmus of Land that
faceth the pleasant Isles of <HI>Orkney;</HI> where the
Inhabitants are blest with the plenty of Grass
and Grain; besides Fish, Flesh, and Fowl in
abundance. Now that Barnicles (which are a
certain sort of wooden Geese) breed hereabouts,
it's past dispute; and that they fall off from
the Limbs and Members of the Fir-tree, is que|stionless;
and those so fortunate to espouse the
Ocean (or any other River, or humitactive Soil)
by virtue of Solar He<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">t are destinated to live;
but to all others so unfortunate to fall upon dry
Land, are denied their Nativity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you credit your own Report; or do
you impose these Hyperbole's ironically upon
<PB N="178" REF="111">
the World, designedly to make <HI>Scotland</HI> appear
a Kingdom of Prodigies?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>No certainly! and that there is such a
Fowl I suppose none doubts it; but if any do,
let him resort to <HI>Cambden, Speed,</HI> or <HI>Gerhard</HI>'s
Herbal, and there he shall find that in <HI>Lanca|shire,</HI>
thousands were gathered up, adhering to
the broken Ribs of a Ship wreck'd upon that
Coast; but these are not like the Barnicle Geese
that I speak of: the like Accident hapned in <HI>Kent</HI>
sometime past, and in many other parts of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
&amp;c. So that few Ingenious and Intelligible
Travellers doubt a Truth in this Matter; and
the rather, because it sedulously examined, it
discovers a want of Faith to doubt what's con|firmed
by such credible Authority. But if
Eye-sight be Evidence against Contradiction,
and the Sense of Feeling argument good enough
to refute Fiction, then let me bring these two
convincing Arguments to maintain my Asser|tion;
for I have held a Barnicle in my own
Hand, when as yet unfledg'd, and hanging by the
Beak, which as I then supposed of the Fir-tree;
for it grew from thence, as an Excrescence
grows on the Members of an Animal: and as
all things have Periods, and in Time drop off,
so does the Barnicle by a natural Progress se|parate
it self from the Member it's conjoin'd
to.</P>
<P>But further, to explicate the Method and
Manner of this wooden Goose more plainly:
The first appearing Parts are her Rump and
Legs; next to them, her callous and unploom'd
Body; and last of all her Beak, by which she
hangs immature, and altogether insensible; be|cause
<PB N="179" REF="111">
not as yet having any spark of Life hi|therto
discovered to shine about her. Then,
like the Leaves in <HI>October</HI> that leisurely drop
off (since predestinated to fall) even so the Bar|nicle
drops off from the Twig of the Tree to
which Nature had fastned her, and gave her
a Growth, and an inanimate Being. Where
note, to so many as providentially fall into
Water, Protection is immediately sent them
to live; but to all others as accidentally en|counter
dry Land, such I presume are doom'd
to die without Redemption. And though some
of them are commissioned to live, yet how
difficult is it to preserve Life when hourly sought
after by the luxurious Devourer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>However, let not our discourse of Geese
discover us ungrateful to the Inhabitants. For
it were Madness more than good Manners, not
to acknowledg Civilities from a People that so
civilly treated us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Civility wanting, we are wanting to
our selves; when too much of Self bars the
Fruits of Society. Now we tread on the Bor|ders
of <HI>Southerland,</HI> that of right belongs to the
Earl of <HI>Southerland;</HI> whose eldest Son is born
Lord of <HI>Stranavar.</HI> On the top of that little
Hill, stands little <HI>Dun Robin;</HI> it's a Castle,
though but a small one; where the Earl him|self
inhabits. But that other great House, or
rath<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">r some piece of Decays, they call it <HI>Skibbo;</HI>
but there is yet another ruinous Castle that
stands on the brow of a lofty Hill, and that they
call <HI>Skelbo.</HI> These are all the Castles, and most
eminent Fabricks in <HI>Southerland,</HI> to the best of
my Observation.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="112">
The next thing we meet with is the Lough
<HI>Broroh,</HI> that spouts forth a River into the Bow|els
of the Ocean. This Lough is deep, but not
so large as the <HI>Ness,</HI> (elevated in 59 Degrees
North Latitude) but very full of Salmon; and
though the River seems to have rapid Streams,
yet the Tides influence them every twelve Hours.
I mention this <HI>Broroh,</HI> for no other purpose,
than to reflect on her plenty of Salmon,
where they barrel up for <HI>France,</HI> and other parts
annually, (as reported) so much Salmon as a|mounts
to three hundred pound <HI>Sterling</HI> a Year;
and the price of a Salmon (among themselves)
seldom exceeds one single Denare. Where not
the Profits of this contemptible <HI>Broroh,</HI> are
farm'd by the Inhabitants inhabiting here|abouts,
but the Propriety belongs to the Earl of
<HI>Southerland.</HI> But <HI>Dornoch</HI> is all the Corporati|ons

<P>On <HI>Terra firma,</HI> where should we be?
and this is the Town of <HI>Tayn</HI> in <HI>Ross,</HI> that equal|lizeth
<HI>Dornoch</HI> for beautiful Buildings; and as
exemplary as any Place for Justice, that never
use Gibbet nor Halter to hang a Man, but sacks
all their Malefactors, so swims them to their
Graves. Now the most spacious and eminent
Fabricks in <HI>Ross,</HI> are <HI>Tarbot,</HI> situate near the
Sea; <HI>Mees,</HI> bordering upon <HI>Lough Loon; Bal|nagoon,</HI>
a strong Fabrick on the brinks of <HI>Clowd;
Fowlds,</HI> a great House not far from <HI>Brawn; In|nerbrachy,</HI>
a Mannor near <HI>Portus Salutis; Mil|ton,</HI>
a Castle opposite to <HI>Cromerty.</HI> These Fa|bricks

<PB N="181" REF="112">

Geese, Gossander, Duck and Malard, Teal,

<P>This is that famous <HI>Portus Salutis,</HI> accommo|dated

are but of little value. But what have I to do
to discourse a Country, where Eggs are sold
for twenty four a Penny, and all other Accom|modations
proportionable? This I presume is
no dear Entertainment; nor ever expect to

incrustate the Earth near the Shores: for the
very Sands are so contempered from a natural
innate Quality of Warmth, occasioned it's pos|sible
from the Salinity of the Ocean, which
suddenly dissolves the Snow that falls, preanti|cipating
the formation of Frost, or any such
like Coagulum. And this is the reason her
Shores are enrich'd with Fertility, were but the
<PB N="182" REF="113">
People polish'd with Art and Agriculture; for
were it so, I should then conclude them blest
with a delightful Prospect, that flows from the
fluctuating Generosity of <HI>Portus Salutis.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this the Castle, and the Coast of <HI>Cro|merty?</HI>
How do the People do to free themselves
from the Depredations of the <HI>Highlanders.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well enough; it's morally impossible it
should be otherwise, except Nature run retro|grade:
I know no other distinction, than be|low
and above Stairs; but I should have told
you (since a received Opinion) that the great|est
plenty of Fish and Fowl that belongs to
<HI>Scotland,</HI> falls in or near this <HI>Portus Salutis;</HI>
where Lobsters are sometimes sold for Bodles
a piece; but for Crabs, Perewinkles, and va|rious
other Shell-Fish, as Cockles, and Mussels
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Natives are not nice to share such
Entertainments amongst Strangers; meaning
such as cruise all along their Coast, till the Sea|son
of the Year compels them off.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's a pleasant part of a Country, I con|fess,
though methinks it stands almost out of
the World.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let it stand as it will stand, it stands
well enough, by reason it borders so near the
<HI>Highlands.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then it will look further off from
Home. For these <HI>Highlands</HI> to my thinking but
represent a part of the Creation left undrest:
As some great and magnificent Fabrick is ere|cted,
you know abundance of Rubbish is left to
remove; so I fancy those <HI>Highlands</HI> appear to
me, because wanting Ornament, and destitute
of Cultivation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="183" REF="113">
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You shall have it on your own Terms,
as void of Form as the Natives are indigent of
Morals and good Manners. However, from
these eminent Rocks we descry the Ocean, and
the Ships sometimes as they cruise upon the
Coast. But now the Air that was serene, is
thickned, I fancy, and struck with impressions
of Cold; for the Wrack of Clouds begin to
roll about, variously intermingled with a rapid
Motion; and the lower Region swells and looks
big, but the Nights direct to an equal Pro|portion
with the Days: so that observing
the Summer in a declining posture, what think
you of fixing our Inclinations Southward?
And in our Countermarch, take a breviate of
all the Rivers, Rivulets, Cities, Citadels, Ca|stles
and Corporations, that lie in our way,
till we face their magnificent Metropolis of
<HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
</SP>

<P>I approve of the Motion well enough, it
comports with my Inclination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us then proceed methodically, and
commence with the Castle of <HI>Cromerty,</HI> where
the Laird <HI>Vrquart</HI> lived in his Life-time; who
had twice twenty Children standing at once be|fore
him; but thirty were Sons, and ten of
them Daughters; and all at the State of Men
and Women, yet not one natural Child amongst
them (as I was told). Now this venerable
Laird of <HI>Vrquart</HI> lived to the utmost Limit and
Period of Life; whose declining Age invites
him to contemplate Mortality, and cruciate
himself, by fancying his Cradle his Sepulchre,
wherein he was lodg'd Night after Night, and
hal'd up by Pullies to the Roof of his House;
<PB N="184" REF="114">
approaching as near as the Roof would let him,
to the beautiful Battlements and Suburbs of
Heaven.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was not this that <HI>Vrquart,</HI> whose eldest
Son writ a Treatise in Honour of his Pedigree;
wherein he describes his Genealogy from
<HI>Adam?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's the very same, for he traced his De|scent
from the Garden of <HI>Eden.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then was his Book domm'd to be
stuff'd with nothing but fantastical fabulous Fi|ctions?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because his Country-men thought it too
ambiguous for any Man to trace his Pedigree
from Paradise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was that all? had they no Antiquaries
amongst them? But hold a little, what Place
is this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Old <HI>Chanery,</HI> hung about with Charms,
that inchanted a Crampus to come ashore,
whose Bulk (some fancied) burdned the Sands:
but he became a Prey to the English Infantry.
Now we trace the flourishing Fields of <HI>Murry|land;</HI>
and thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> is Old <HI>Ern</HI> where Marquess <HI>Mon|tross</HI>
engaged his Country-men, and totally

the Rat; because so numerous in these Nor|thern
Parts, that a Cat can scarcely get a living
amongst them.</P>

Clothes on, upon which these Vermin would
dance and totter, as if invited by the dull
sound of a Northern-Country Bagpipe, their
natural Musick, and most congruous to their
Kind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have been told, that these Vermin po|liticians
storm the Town once or twice a Year,
to the terrifying amazement of all the Inhabi|tants;
and that Cats durst not be seen to scout
abroad, lest hazarding their Lives whenever
they encounter.</P>

<P>That's matter of Fact; who doubts the
truth on't?</P>
</SP>

<P>That should I, were I not convinc'd to
the contrary. But what remarkable Monu|ments
are these like Pyramids in the ambient

<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know not, except some Signals of Vi|ctory;

<P>What Town call ye that, that presents

</SP>
<SP>

<P>The famous <HI>Elgin,</HI> situated on a Level,

whose spacious Ports surround a Cathe|dral,
blotted and blurr'd by the Dates of
Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>However it appears that some eminent
Characters are left yet to evidence the Foot|steps
of superannuated Curiosity, and inform us
the Antiquity of her original Lustre.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="115">
And that is all; but not Lustre enough left
to vie with the gaity of those famous Imbel|lishments
of <HI>Westminster</HI>-Chappel: that Ora|cle
strikes all Structures dumb, and is the Non|such
of <HI>Europe,</HI> nay, all the World; Models of
it have been transported into Foreign Parts,
and equally admired, with <HI>Oliver</HI>'s Medals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Elgin</HI> was once a Beauty, nor is it now
an artificial Deformity; yet such is the Uncon|stancy
of Men and Times, that this Fabrick is
defaced, and Prelacy thrown down: methinks
I could almost lament her Ruins; these margi|nal

<P>Yet is there a Beauty in <HI>Elgin</HI>'s Antiqui|ties;

pretend to outvie it in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess that imbelish'd Fabricks
are more my Admiration that perplexed Con|troversies.
What profit is there in unprofita|ble
Disputations? That Genius to me seems dis|ingenious
and turbulent, that is always angling
in tempestuous Streams. Our occasion invites
us to Recreation, not Riot. To a Description
of the Country; not to register her Faults,
and obliterate her Favours. What have we to
do with Secular Affairs? the Management of
Kingdoms and National Concerns is nothing our
Business; nor need our Curiosity inspect the
Artificers of the Law that fleece the Country,
whilst <HI>Presbyter Iohn</HI> writes his Funeral-Epitaph
with <HI>Iure Divino.</HI></P>

<P>Our Discourse I perceive, if we be not

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, here's an open Passage to the glit|tering
Streams of <HI>Trespey,</HI> that generously ac|commodates
the Angler, whilst the Natives fre|quently
consult the Net, for the Treasures of
Pearl, studiously concealed in the gravelly Deeps.
Why should Nature's Ornaments want Admi|ration,

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What fair Fabrick is that which stands
before us?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Bogagieth,</HI> the Marquess of <HI>Huntly</HI>'s Pa|lace,
all built with Stone, facing the Ocean;
whose fair Front (set Prejudice aside) worthily
deserves an English Man's Applause for her lof|ty
and majestick Towers and Turrets, that
storm the Air; and seemingly make dints in
the very Clouds. At first sight, I must confess,
it struck me with admiration, to gaze on so
gawdy and regular a Frontispiece; more espe|cially
when to consider it in the Nook of a Na|tion.
Nor do I know any reason, but that
every English Man should advance a due pro|portion
of <HI>Scotland</HI>'s Fame, as freely and can|didly
as of his own native Country; provided
the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> deserve it. I have
told you that the Name of this House is <HI>Boga|gieth,</HI>
alluding, as I fancy, to the Nature of the
Place, by reason the Ground appears so Boggy;
whose Battlements on a fair Day display them|selves
to the Portals of <HI>Elgin.</HI> But more
Southerly yet are the Fortifications of <HI>Straboggy,</HI>
bordering on the Tracts to <HI>Aberdeen;</HI> which
<PB N="188" REF="116">
also belongs to the Marquess <HI>Huntly,</HI> the chief
of the Clan of the <HI>Gordons;</HI> as is Earl <HI>Sea|forth,</HI>
chief of the <HI>Mackenzies.</HI> Now this bulky
<HI>Straboggy</HI> has an invincible Tower, so large and
stupendous that it burdens the Earth, and is
without precedent the largest in <HI>Scotland;</HI> situ|ated
on a Flat, begirt with Bogs, amalgamiz'd
with loomish marly Clay, and cemented into
Rocks, makes prospect by a short interview to
the Skirts of the <HI>Highlands,</HI> whilst the elevated
Tarrasses of beautiful <HI>Bogagieth</HI> overlook the

stately Palace, as <HI>Elgin</HI> is admired for a sump|tuous
Cathedral.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are these those Savanna's so enrich'd

Plenty, and does not every Shore shine with
silver Sands, whilst the craggy Cliffs stand bur|den'd
with Trees?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>It answers your Description; as the
Tower of <HI>Straboggy</HI> seems impregnable, yet
Marquess <HI>Argile</HI> once earth'd so deep in't, that
all the Clan of the <HI>Gordons</HI> could not under|mine
him, notwithstanding their Popularity,

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What caused the Difference, could not
the Law reconcile them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>No nor the Gospel neither; if when to
consider their Difference in Opinion, for the
<HI>Gordons</HI> you must know are profest Roman-Catholicks;
and <HI>Scotland,</HI> nay all the World
knows that the <HI>Campbels</HI> are Presbyterians. Now
the first won't live without a Universal Bishop,

<P>No, I think not, if they hold to the
Point.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Let the Point be what it will, these are
the stately Turrets of <HI>Straboggy,</HI> where I fancy
the Bogs would baffle our Horses, did not a
Countermarch towards our native Country
sweeten the Toil. So our delicious Fragrancies,
were they stuck in these Northern Fields, would
certainly perfume them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>You have eminent Thoughts of Home;
but how will it happen to us here, coming so

<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>How vainly do we flatter our selves, that
in these solitary Fields, immur'd with Moun|tains
and besieg'd with Bogs, where Heath and
Haddir are the height of our Horses, there to
expect Moor-fowl and Manchet inseparable
Companions? No no, let a Dish of Sewins
serve us for Supper, rather than dream of a
delicious <HI>Regalia;</HI> and instead of an <HI>Olio,</HI> a
broil'd Haddock; or it may be a Scots Collop, if
we can get it. But I'le welcome any thing that
comes seasonably to thaw the Icicles that flatten
the edg of my Appetite; so that now if only to find
the People courteous, tho not over-curious, and
their Pantries provided with Meat, tho themselves
be destitute of Manners, it matters not. We
<PB N="190" REF="117">
are capable enough to distinguish Academies
from Ale-houses, and Change-Houses from a
Royal Exchange. What matters it then for
Cooks, where every Man may dress his own
Commons? and let the Provision of this day's
Exercise (if Trout and Plover be Food fit for
Travellers) be my care; and I'le supervise the
Roast, whilst you rest your self, and send you
Summons upon the first savory Scent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have very well contriv'd to salute
our Mouths with a Modicum, lest our Appe|tites
alienate; for if fasting too long brings e|qual
Danger with a Riot of Feasting, a Surfeit
of either may impare the Mediocrity of Health:
for as the one ushers in Fevers that terminate
in Flames, so the other, in regard of its moist
Frigidity, melts all the Members into a De|luge,
by extinguishing the irradiating vital Heat;
which insensibly draws on a deprav'd Fer|ment,
preternatural to the Archeus or Rector
of the Ventricle. Thus we range the World,
by rifling <HI>Scotland,</HI> to refresh our selves; and
blot out those limpid Streams of <HI>Trespey,</HI> that
glide so smoothly near to the famous Foundati|ons
of <HI>Bogagieth;</HI> which beyond dispute discovers
the Glory of <HI>Scotland</HI> epitomiz'd in this short
Day's Expedition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now should the flaming Steeds of the
Sun touch the Cusp of the Horizon before we
rise, would not all Mankind conclude us affe|cted
with Ease and Idleness? and if so, then
mark the Conclusion, the Sluggard he is ra|vished
with Ease and long Nights; and the
Epicure in Raptures at a luxurious Table. Now
see what follows; but as Disease is the Child
<PB N="191" REF="117">
of Intemperance, and Idleness the Parent of
Penury and Want; Disease therefore is the
Reward of Repletion, and Death the final Cap|tivator
of Mortals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Discourse I perceive has brought
something to bear; for now I see the World's
great Luminary gild the Rocks, and polish
the Surface of the smoother Streams. The
Heavens shine their Blessings most propitiously
upon us; but the Earth beyond dispute will
prove rugged and knotty, (since reflecting on
my self) that from <HI>Straboggy</HI> to <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> there's
not a more irregular Path in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>

<P>There's the Magnet that attracts the
Chalybs, the Root of the Matter I perceive lies
there; <HI>England</HI> is the End, and <HI>Scotland</HI> the
Mean. However we must pass by the flourish|ing
Streams of <HI>Dee,</HI> so much discours'd by
every Angler, where the generosity of every
Ford furnishes him with Trout; as do her so|lid
and more torpid Deeps accommodate him
with Salmon, had we leisure to experience
them; but Time, like us and our Occasion, rides
Post.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>If Opportunity and Importunity strike
Difficulties dead, then why do we ramble these
rolling Streams, and produce nothing?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes but we do, if only to tell the World
that the Marquess <HI>Montross,</HI> a Peer of the King|dom,
and a General of incomparable Conduct
and Courage in these solitary Fields (though
with but a small Brigade of Souldiers) fought
<PB N="192" REF="118">
with his Country-men, and totally routed them.
And to make the Miracle yet more miraculous,
this famous Martialist obtained another signal
Victory; though when under those ill Cir|cumstances,
as not to reinforce himself; yet
with that Bravery he redoubled his Resolution,
and fought them under the very Walls of this
flourishing <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> from whence he brought
off the Trophies. And this is that famous
<HI>Aberdeen,</HI> whose Western Suburbs are guarded
by the Hills; as are those Levels more Eastern|ly
saluted by the Ocean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this that <HI>Aberdeen</HI> so generally dis|cours'd
by the Scots for Civility?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and Humanity too; for it's the Pa|ragon
of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why do not you call it by the Name of
a City?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>It matters not much for that, since the
general Vogue of a Town serves as well:
however it's a Corporation, and that's enough;
and I'm convinc'd it stands in a cultivated Coun|try,
that never knew the Force of Sterrility;
whose Banks are bathed with the glittering
Streams of <HI>Dee,</HI> and her Walls shaded with
fertil Corn Fields, promulgates Plenty; for
Heaven, by the Law of Generosity, certainly
has bless'd her: for here the Sun so moderates
the Cold in Winter, that it seldom or rarely
freezes her Sands; whose Increase is multiplied
from the generous Breasts of the Ocean. And
from whence both Mariner and Merchant ac|cumulate
Treasure, because to drag it forth
from the solid Deeps of the Sea; when at o|ther
times they import their Goods into the
<PB N="193" REF="118">
<HI>Highlands,</HI> as they export Commodities into
remote Countries.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the Harbour, I fancy, that's some|what
too strait; and the Entrance, as I con|ceive,
much too narrow; however it's examined
secure enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Peradventure it is; yet these Rocks at
the entrance terrify the Pilot, as her Harbour,
when entred, exhilarates the Passenger. Now
the Buildings of this City are framed with
Stone and Timber; facing the Sun, and front|ing
this pleasant Harbour: the Streets also are
large and spacious, and the Walls strengthned
with Towers and Buttresses of Stone. So that
nothing, in my Opinion, remains defective to
compleat them happy; for if not to waste by
an Overpluss, they can never pine away by a
Want.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fancy this Place situate in a pleasant
part of a Country; and so was that Relique of
Antiquity we but newly past by, when ap|proaching
the Suburbs of this flourishing City.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do well to remind me, for I had al|most
forgot it; that was old <HI>Aberdeen:</HI> things
that grow ancient, grow out of Fashion; how|ever,
it's the Mother City of New <HI>Aberdeen,</HI>
and a University to boot, wherein stands an
old weather-beaten Cathedral, that looks like
the Times, somewhat irregular: but of that I
have little to say, since others before me
thought requisite to erect such publick Places for
private Devotion, when this present Generati|on
conform themselves, by contracting their
Congregations to lesser now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="194" REF="119">
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this old <HI>Aberdeen</HI> an old University?
why then a Sophister may pick up as much E|thicks
and Politicks as will serve him to stuff
out a pair of Lawn Sleeves. Cathedrals in some
Countries influence the Inhabitants, as Planets
you know have government over the Vital
Parts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You must have a slash at the Gown I
perceive; but what think you of the Church in
new <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> (that's no Cathedral) where the
Magistrates sit under the Soveraignty of the
Mace, and every Merchant in his peculiar Pew;
where every Society of Mechanicks have their
particular Seats, distinguished by Escutcheons,
sutable to their Profession; so that Confusion
seldom or rarely happens amongst them, in
quarrelling for Places: where Strangers are
unsuspected for Informers and Intruders, and
the Civility of the People such, that no Man
is left destitute of a Seat to sit on, but every
one entertained answerable to his Quality?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is something like; for it far exceeds
the Custom of <HI>England,</HI> where a Man may stand
in some Churches till his Feet are surbeat, yet no
Body proffer him a Remove, or a Stool to sit on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>But this is not all neither; for here you
shall have such Method in their Musick, and such
Order and Decorum of Song-devotion in the
Church, as you will admire to hear, though not
regulated by a Cantor or Quirister, but only
by an insipid Parochial Clerk that never at|tempts
further in the Mathematicks of Musick,
than to compleat the Parishioners to sing a
Psalm in Tune.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="195" REF="119">
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have concisely characterized <HI>Aber|deen,</HI>
with her Inhabitants; but what have we
here? Cawses uncartable, and Pavements un|practicable,
pointed with rocky stumpy Stones,
and dawb'd all over with dingy Dirt, that
makes it unpassible; and the Fields, as I con|ceive,
are ten times worse, because o'respread
with miry Clay, and incumbred with Bogs that
will bury a Horse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>For better for worse, we must through
it, if intending to climb the Southern Elevati|ons.
Now at the foot of this Pavement there's
a small little Harbour, which they call <HI>Steen|hive,</HI>
but I take the liberty to call it <HI>stinking
Hive,</HI> because it's so unsavory; which serves only

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Donnotter</HI>-Castle surrounded with Sea,
and Waves for recreation dance about it:
it's a House so inoculated and cemented into
Rocks, that a Man would fancy it to swim in
the Ocean; and the natural Strength so impreg|nable,
supposeth the Artificial but inconsidera|ble,
whose rocky Foundations, like <HI>Atlas</HI>'s
Pillars, support the bulk of this gaudy For|tress.
For Art and Artist are but Nature's Sub|stitutes;
where-ever therefore Nature ceaseth
to operate, then is the time for the Artist to
begin his Progress. But Nature has finished
what she had to do, and has left nothing for the
Artist to practise, save only to adorn the na|tural
Excellency. After this manner is that ar|tificial
Imbellishment, for the Rock it self is
<PB N="196" REF="120">
the natural Strength, then the Castle can be but
the Artificial. From when we conclude, that
Nature and Art have form'd such a Fabrick for
Strength and Beauty, that amuzes and amazes
every Beholder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I behold and consider this invincible
Castle, lifted up like a Cloud into the ambient
Air. I have also considered the gaity of her
Galleries, and those Ornaments that adorn her
gaudy Frontiers. I have also considered those
opposite Mountains, whose formidable Aspect
are no pleasing Prospect to those imbellish'd
Battlements, that seemingly float in the Arms
of the Ocean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have hit the Key, and now let me
tune up the Instrument; those Mountains mar
all: yet in this fair Fortress they conceal the
<HI>Regalia</HI>'s of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from such sacrilegious
Hands that would steal Diadems to adorn their
Ambitions; so rob their Prince to inrich them|selves:
for here it is in this solitary Rock be|sieged
with Sea, that <HI>Scotland</HI> has conceal'd both
Ornament and Treasure; and what greater
Ornament to a Prince than a Crown?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I can believe as an Article of my
Creed, yet all is not Gold that glisters; for
should all Reports pass muster for Realities,
Truth it self might be brought into the Scan|dal
of Suspicion. That the Crown has been
lodg'd in <HI>Donnotter,</HI> I dispute not, yet <HI>Dumbar|ton</HI>
I should think in all respects as secure, and
<HI>Edinburgh</HI>-Castle as secure as either, to conceal
that Treasure from degenerate Mercenaries,
that would violate their Trust though they ven|ture
to hang for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="197" REF="120">
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are in the right on't, but the Road
I fancy runs not so rough as it did; nor are my
Apprehensions of <HI>England</HI> so remote as they
were: both the Way and the Weather favour
our Designs in this Southern Expedition: for
<HI>England</HI>'s our Prospect, now propound you the
Object: and as we ride along to the Town of
<HI>Montrose,</HI> signify your Opinion of the flourishing
<HI>Aberdeen.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>You impose a little too hard upon me,
I can scarcely express my Opinion of a Place,
but I must be sentenced too much to commend
it. On the other Hand, should I lessen or im|pair
their Civilities, then you challenge me to
reflect on our civil Entertainments. This Di|lemma
I am driven to. However you cannot
deny, but acknowledg, that <HI>Aberdeen</HI> is sweet|ly
situated, and under the Government of well-regulated
Magistrates: No complaint of Po|verty,
nor luxurious Supersluities; where the
Houses are fill'd with Hospitality, not with
Prophaneness; their Streets and Allies cleanly
swept and paved, and their Church and State-house
very curiously kept, after the best Methods
of the Scotish Mode. But how <HI>Montrose</HI> will re|present
unto us, that I suspend to determine till
farther examination.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Trouble not your self with that Affair, for
<HI>Montrose</HI> will murder all your Suspicions. Her
generous Entertainments in every Angle, like
radiated Beams of the Sun that invigorate the
Earth, so naturally do the Inhabitants influ|ence
their Civilities amongst Strangers; which
remonstrates <HI>Montrose</HI> a Beauty that lies con|ceal'd,
as it were in the bosom of <HI>Scotland;</HI>
<PB N="198" REF="121">
most delicately drest up, and adorn'd with ex|cellent
Buildings, whose Foundations are laid
with polish'd Stone, and her Ports all wash'd with
the Silver Streams that trickle down from the
Famous <HI>Ask.</HI> This is <HI>Montrose</HI> in the County of
<HI>Angus,</HI> antiently known by the Name of <HI>Cae|lurcha.</HI>
Tell me how you like it, whose Gaity
and Gallantry springs from the Nobility and
Gentry; but the Wealth of the City, from her
Merchants and Manufacture: and though you
see not her Harbours deck'd with delicate Ship|ping,
yet she contents her self with a pleasant Ri|ver,
that commodes the Inhabitant with the
Blessings of Plenty, and that's enough. So to
sum up all in a Compendious Narrative, we in|title
<HI>Montrose,</HI> the <HI>Mount of Roses.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Encomium more elegant, or what
Character more eminent for these sweet Situa|tions,
than the Rosy Mount of our Northern
Latitude? Nay, what expressions could be ad|ded
more compendiously significant to characte|rize
the Beautiful Elevations and Imbellishments
of <HI>Montrose</HI> I know not: then let this short
Derivation answer all Objections; whilst we
enter her Ports, and use Arguments of Refresh|ment
to our hostile Appetites, in regard so fa|mous
a River as the famous <HI>Ask</HI> salutes her
Banks and flourishing Shores with daily sup|plies,
to relieve her Inhabitants, and accomo|date
Strangers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now our next Advance is to the Town of
<HI>Dundee:</HI> but give me leave to call it Deplorable
<HI>Dundee,</HI> and not to be exprest without a Deluge
of Tears; because storm'd and spoil'd by the
rash precipitancy of Mercenaries, whose rapi|nous
<PB N="199" REF="121">
Hands put a fatal Period to her stately Im|bellishments,
with the loss of many innocent
lives, altogether unconcern'd in that unnatural
Controversy.</P>
<P>Ah poor <HI>Dundee!</HI> torn-up by the Roots; and
thy Natives and Inhabitants pick'd out at the
Port-holes. Can Honour shine in such Bloody
Sacrifices, to lick up the lives of Inhabitants, as
if by a studied revenge? Can nothing sweeten the
Conquerours Sword, but the reeking Blood of
Orphans and Innocents? Blush O Heavens, what
an Age is this! There was Wealth enough to
answer their Ambitions, and probably that as
soon as any thing betrayed her. Could nothing
satisfy the unsatiable Sword, but the Life of <HI>Dun|dee</HI>
to atone as a Sacrifice? English Men without
Mercy, are like Christians without Christianity;
no Moderation nor Pity left, but parcelling out
the lives of poor Penitents in cold Blood? Who
must answer for this at the Bar of Heaven, be|fore
the Judg of all the World? but he that
doom'd <HI>Dundee</HI> to die, is dead himself, and
doom'd e're this; and <HI>Dundee</HI> yet living to sur|vive
his Cruelty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this <HI>Dundee!</HI> Disconsolate <HI>Dundee,</HI>
where the merciless Conquerour stuck down his
Standard in Streams of Blood?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, this is that Unfortunate and De|plorable
<HI>Dundee,</HI> whose Laurels were stript from
the Brow of her Senators, to adorn the Con|quering
Tyrant's Head. Here it was that every
Arbour flourished with a Fruitful Vine; and
here every Border was beautified with fragrant
Flowers. Yet her Situation seems to me none
of the best, for if bordering too near the brinks
<PB N="200" REF="122">
of the Ocean proves Insalubrious, or stooping
too low to salute the Earth, incommodes Health
by unwholsom Vapours; then to stand elevated
a pitch too high, suffocates with Fumes, that equal|ly
offend and infect the Air, by blotting out Sa|nity
with the Soveraignty of Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>This somewhat answers my former Opi|nion,
that neither Honour nor Riches, nor the
Ambitions of Men, stand in competition with
the Mediocrity of Health; nor is there any Bles|sing
under the Sun adequate to the Soveraign
Sanctions of Sanity on this side Eternity, but
the Radies of Sanctification from the Sun of
Righteousness. The World's a Fool, and none
but Fools admire it: Yet not that I prophane
the Beautiful Creation; when only censuring that
fictitious and imaginary World in Man. Go on
with <HI>Dundee,</HI> I overflow with Pity; and could
wish my Reluctancy Penitency enough to weep
her into a Religious Repentance, but not with
<HI>Rachel</HI> never to be comforted. Hark <HI>Arnoldus!</HI>
Don't you hear the Bells?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes I hear them, and what of that? Bells
and Bonfires are two Catholick Drumsticks,
with which the Church beats up for Volunteers
only to debauch them. For what end were Bells
hung up, if not to Jangle; and Bonfires kindled,
if not to Blaze like an <HI>Ignis fatuus?</HI> Thus Peo|ple
uncultivated are like Land untill'd, and Arts
unimprov'd print the footsteps of Penury. But
Arts are improv'd by industrious Ingenuity;
when through want of Ingenious Industry they
slide into a Non-entity. As no Man can be tru|ly
Religious without good Morals, so no Man
without good Morals can be in any measure Re|ligious.
<PB N="201" REF="122">
Not that I assert Religion is Morality;
but Morality is the Porch that lets into the Tem|ple.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>You paraphrase upon Bells; I wonder
how you miss'd Bag-pipes, since the one has as
much the root of the matter in't as the other.
By these mystical Metaphors, if I hit the Mark,
you present <HI>England</HI> an Emblem of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and
<HI>Scotland</HI> but a piece of English Imitation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You don't hit the Key right, but I per|ceive
<HI>England</HI> lies close siege in your Bosom;
however there ought to be some charity for <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
that so generously entertained you with|all
sorts of Varieties.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI>'tis true has variety enough, to
confuse and confound all the Cooks in <HI>England.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this I'll grant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you must grant their Butter but
little better then Grease we usually grease Cart|wheels
withal; which nauseates my Palat if
but to think on't, or remember the Hand that
made it up. I know there are Men that have
Maws like Muck-hills, that can feed as freely
upon tainted Flesh, as you and I upon Pheasant
and Partridge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>What then?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then you argue as if you had lost
your English Appetitie, and I would not for all
the Varieties in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that the resentments of
<HI>England</HI> should expire in my Palat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does Hunger make any distinction in
Dainties? if not, then why should Scotish Kale
blot out the Character of English Colliflowers?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shan't dispute the point, but the very
thoughts of <HI>England</HI> sweetens my apprehensions,
<PB N="202" REF="123">
that possibly e're long I may taste of a Southern
Sallad: However, this I'll say in the Honour of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> that Cold and Hunger are inseparable
Companions, but their Linens are fresh; and
were not their Beds so short, they would serve
well enough for weary Travellers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I fancy they will serve well enough
for us, whilst we trace the fragrant Levels of
<HI>Fife.</HI> For now we relinquish the beautiful Ports
of <HI>Dundee,</HI> to transport in Boats that are steer'd
with a Compass of Straw, by reason of the em|bodied
Mists, to which <HI>Dundee</HI> is as incident as
any part, because standing in a bottom that's
besieged with mucky miry Earth; from whence
there insurrect such pernicious Vapours, as nau|seate
the Air; whereby it becomes almost in|fectious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because it debilitates both the Native
and Inhabitant, and would certainly incapaci|tate
them of Health and long Life, did not
Custom and a Country-Habit plead a prescripti|on,
both as to Physick and Diet: Insomuch, that
neither Gass nor Blass, nor any nauseating suf|focating
Fumes, nor hardly Death it self can
snatch them from <HI>Scotland;</HI> where some Natives
have lived to a prodigious Age.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>But to the Country of <HI>Fife,</HI> I fear you'l
forget it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, doubt it not, nor would I have
you startle the Mariner, who because destitute
of a Card to pilot us over by, is compell'd to
make use of a Compass of Straw.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>A very ingenious Invention; pray tell us
the manner on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="203" REF="123">
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't push too hard upon me; and I'll
tell you this new way of Navigation. When
Cloudy Mists arise that darken the face of the
Firmament, and threaten danger without any
Disturbance, you shall then see the Seamen stuff
the Stern with Straw, as now they do with lit|tle
Trusses, which they successively expose one
at a time; and so supply it time after time from
the Stern of the Vessel, till at length they arrive
at the desired Shoar, as now we do: And thus
have I past and repast from <HI>Dundee.</HI> Nor is
there any difficulty nor danger to any Man more
than hazarding his Carcase in Timber. Now
welcome ashore to the Fields in <HI>Fife;</HI> where
we must exchange our Navigable Horses for
Hackneys.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What must we call the name of this
Town?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Cooper</HI> in <HI>Fife:</HI> it's a Corporation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what other Town is that yet more
Eastward, that seems to lean on the Skirts of the
Ocean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's Antient <HI>Saint Andrews,</HI> their Me|tropolitan
University. Upon the same Coast lie
<HI>Creel</HI> and <HI>Petenweems.</HI> More Southerly yet lie
cockly <HI>Carcawdy</HI> facing the Ocean, and the
Frontiers of <HI>Leith:</HI> we shall only take a view
of the Palace of <HI>Faulkland,</HI> though her fair Im|bellishments
outlustre <HI>Dumfermling.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's our next Stage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Brunt-Island:</HI> But I must remind you of
the Magnificent Palace of <HI>Scoon,</HI> forgot as we
past by the Ports of Saint <HI>Iohnstons,</HI> near whose
elevated Turrets there stands a Kirk, that stands
upon all the Land in <HI>Scotland;</HI> which Kirk is im|mur'd
<PB N="204" REF="124">
with a fair stone Wall; and in that Kirk
they Crown their Kings, and perform the For|malities
of all other Royal Duties; which Re|galia
are the Sword, Spurs, Purse, Crown, Globe,
Scepter and Bible. Now he's a Dunce that
knows not this duty, because it's incumbent on
all the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>But how stands the Kirk upon all the
Kingdom?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>There's not a Royalty in the Kingdom of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> but has sent some part of Earth (from
every Angle) to this place called <HI>Scoon;</HI> which
Earth was dispersed by Laborious Industry;
upon which the Foundations of the Kirk were
laid. So that now you are to consider this Va|riety
of Mould represents but one Uniform and
Compact Body of Earth: Which Earth re|present
the great Volume of <HI>Scotland</HI> in a Bre|viat,
or as I may term it, a little Compen|dium.</P>
<P>Thus our Discourse of the Kirk of <HI>Scoon</HI> has
accompanied us to a view of pleasant <HI>Carcawdy,</HI>
a little pretty Maritime Town (built all with
Stone) that stands in the face of the Ocean, and
the Frontiers of <HI>Fife.</HI> But the time and our occa|sion
constrains us to pass by <HI>Carcawdy,</HI> where
the Inhabitants live more upon Fish than Flesh;
from whose slender Ports we must hasten to
<HI>Brunt-Island,</HI> otherwise we endanger losing our
Tide, which will much incommode us; nor can
we stay there to examine their Curiosities.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What's this that so naturally represents
the Ocean? And what are those Ships, under
Sail? Or must I fancy them a Landskip of move|able
Mountains?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="205" REF="124">
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you fancy them Ships fluctuating to
and fro on those solid Deeps to attempt that
Harbour, you are not much mistaken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is there any Town on those rocky Foun|dations?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes surely there is; for we now discover
the pleasant Shores of Beautiful <HI>Brunt-Island</HI>
guarded with Rocks, that front the Harbour and
the Pier of <HI>Leith;</HI> over whose rubified Sands we
must plough the Ocean, to those delectable flou|rishing
Ports; provided the Vessel be tite and
unleaky, as questionless this is, design'd for our
passage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>However I'll remind you of our hazar|dous
passage from <HI>Innerbrachy</HI> to the famous <HI>Ness,</HI>
as at another time our personal hazard, when
fording over <HI>Forres,</HI> and the rapid <HI>Trespey;</HI> be|sides
other great Rivers and Rivulets in our
march, of very swift and violent motion; which
we often discharg'd without the Artifice of Boats:
and yet I cannot help that natural Antipathy and
Aversion, that I find against Timber Fortifica|tions;
nor can I think them such soveraign Se|curity,
but that sometimes they are accompani'd
with difficulties and danger. It's true, I grant
that no Man has an infallible Protection for Life;
nor a Pre-knowledg of Sickness, nor sudden So|lution.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, if so, transplant those Fears in|to
Foreign Parts; for we must certainly, and that
suddenly, expose our selves to the Mercy of the
Sea, by the Providence of God. Nor is the
Danger more than Imagination; for the fear of
Death to some Men is more dreadful and terri|ble
than Death it self; which great Sea we must
<PB N="206" REF="125">
all sail through, before we cast Anchor in the
Port of Eternity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have sodred the Breach, and salv'd
the Wound, that now I itch to be floating on
the Ocean. However before we embark for <HI>Leith,</HI>
let us give Nature a Philip in the Arms of <HI>Brunt-Island.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>All this we may do, and view the Situa|tions
too, which stands on a flat and flourishing
Level, back'd by <HI>Fife,</HI> and the Mountains of
<HI>Mirt,</HI> whose Foundations are laid in Rocky
Stone, and beautified with the Regularities of
Art, where there's a small but secure Harbour,
to rescue the retreats of the terrified Passenger,
when pursued with the furious Hostility of <HI>Nep|tune,</HI>
whose Waves storm the Shores, insinua|ting
themselves into every Creek. But the Beau|ty
of <HI>Brunt-Island</HI> lies most in her Market-place,
which serves for an Exchange, fronting the Har|bour,
and facing the Ocean; where all or most
of her Merchants Houses stand gazing on the
beautiful Pier of <HI>Leith.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this the Vessel design'd for our passage?
I fancy the Waves begin to work, for my Belly
I'm sure begins to wamble. See how the wrack
of Clouds thicken the Air, and the unlimited
Winds rend the Sky. Who can judg the re|sult
of these surly beginnings, or hope a good
issue in the Conclusion? The very body of the
Sea divides, and opens like a Sepulchre to swal|low
up the Rocks, in whose Concealments lie the
Terrors of Death. The Deeps to my fancy are
broke up; for my nauseating Stomach ebbs and
flows with as strong irritations as the Ebulitions
of the Ocean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="207" REF="125">
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those Tides I confess must run violently
swift, that are hurried along by such furious
Agitations; but for two Tides to meet in one
Sea together, one would think them enough to
make an Inundation. Yet how soon these lofty
Winds are supprest by a Calm, and every Mor|tal
preserv'd to a Miracle. So that the results
of this impetuous Storm, proves only a Fresh and
Flourishing Gale, occasioned by the Conflict of
Winds and Water; which forceth the Sea in
some measure to be sick, and compels her to vo|mit,
as now she does those neuseous Ejectments,
which for ought I know constrains your stomach
to lower and strike Sail; so keep time it may be
with the trepidating Ocean; whose irritations
quickened by the Universal Motion, measure
proportion with the rest of the Creation. So
that this kind of Physick, if I calculate right,
may protract your tampering with Physicians in
the fall.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Of what I'm assur'd, there's no need to
doubt; you talk like a Physician; but not that
I think you a Plagiary, that robs the Dead to
adorn the Living: Nor a Medicaster upon whose
good Deeds the Sun always shines, but the Earth
covers all his bad ones.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have nick't it now I think; however
there's the Pier of <HI>Leith,</HI> and the Beauty of <HI>Scot|land</HI>
in a little Epitome; let us enter her Ports
to refresh our selves.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Shall our Pinnace drop Anchor here, and
the Seamen refresh, whilst we step ashore and
accomodate our selves?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you close up the Orifice of your re|laxed
Stomach with a Glass of brisk Claret? So
<PB N="208" REF="126">
mingle some Liquor with your Maritime Labours,
and thank generous <HI>Neptune</HI> to act the part of a
Physician, to shave off the foreign Ferment from
your crude and indigestive Ventricle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think it not amiss to recal those Spirits,
whose continued absence would enervate my di|gestions,
which now I perceive begin to feel
warmth; and my stagnated unactive Blood
grows more Vigorous and Active in Circulation.
My Pulse also that beats with an equal motion,
and my Body begins to summon Supplies, to gra|tify
and satisfy a craving Appetite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>As these are certain Symptoms of Health,
you put a delay to what you solicit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I do, what then? There's a superan|uated
Custom kept up among the Antients;
that to gratify the Appetitie violates the Creati|on.
This was of old the <HI>Brachmans</HI> Creed, and
is to this day the <HI>Banians Alcoran,</HI> except of late
they have changed their Opinion: for they as|sert,
that Nature would be unnatural to her
self in the destruction of any thing wherein she
favourably had breathed a Life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was this the Primitive Practice of our
former Ancestors?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't say it was, I discourse the <HI>Brach|mans</HI>
that offer this Argument. No Man has a
Commission to create Life, no Man therefore by
any Law or Custom ought to take Life away;
which if he do, he makes himself an Instrument
of unnatural Cruelty, and his Body a Sepul|chre
to bury dead Carcasses in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>But had they consulted our great Oracle
<HI>Moses,</HI> and considered the great Ends of the
great Creator, they would speak I fancy ano|ther
<PB N="209" REF="126">
Dialect, and render unto us a different In|terpretation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>Iews</HI> you may read had a Sanction
among themselves, to celebrate Sacrifices accor|ding
to the Law: and the Christians have a
Sanction among themselves also, to celebrate
their Devotions according to the Gospel. But
the <HI>Banians</HI> comply with neither of these Sancti|ons,
because placing a Sanctity in Custom and
Opinion, not well considering that the World
was made for Man, and not Man for the World;
Meats for the Belly, and not the Belly for Meats.
This in some measure might reform their error,
and undeceive deluded Posterity, hudled under
the false gloss of Custom and Opinion. On the o|ther
hand, as every Man has a Natural Right and
Creational Privilege, as Lord of the Creation;
so no Man has a Creational Right, nor Natural
Priviledge to make his Appetite the Rule for De|struction.
Providence allows due supplies to
every Man; but no Man can warrant or justify
his Riot.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were this Argument approv'd of, it would,
I suspect, overthrow our design of Angling.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all; for my Opinion is, the Argu|ment
it self manifestly strengthens it. The Text
calls to <HI>Peter,</HI> Arise, kill and eat; and <HI>Peter</HI>
objects against what's common and unclean: But
<HI>Peter</HI> was answered by a Voice from Heaven,
Nothing was unclean that God had cleansed. Sa|crifices
and Oblations were under the Seal of the
Law, but the last Supper and Miracles shined un|der
the Sunshine of the Gospel. <HI>Adam</HI> stood unli|mited,
the forbidden Tree only excepted. Na|ture
<PB N="210" REF="127">
was unconfined, and the Creation blest with
multiplicity of Blessings, till <HI>Adam</HI>'s Transgressi|on.
But as Nature operates the Will of the Cre|ator,
so the Nations shall bow to the Son of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>So let the Argument drop; only give us a
Description of the Situations of <HI>Leith.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Leith</HI> stands, as you see, situated on a
Level surrounded by Sea on the North-East;
and guarded on the South with Neals Craigs,
and <HI>Arthur</HI>'s Seat, that hangs over <HI>Edinburgh.</HI>
But the Fabricks of <HI>Leith</HI> are built with Stone,
hovering over the Pier, and fronting the Ocean,
almost drown'd under Water; and that which is
worse, if worse can be, those nauseating Scents
suckt greedily from the Sea, bring Arguments
of Disease, and sometimes Summons for Death.
On the other hand, <HI>Scotland</HI> cannot present
you with a more pleasant Port; for here the
Houses and Structures are large and lofty, and
the Pier like a Gnomen directs to the Tol|booth.
Here also stands a substantial Cawsey
that leads to the Bridg, that brings you to a Cita|del
that was, but now is not, because hudled in
dust, and ruinous heaps; yet not ruin'd by Age,
nor torn with the scars and impressions of
War; but Policy, and not Piety, laid her Surface
in the Sand.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Merchandize doth she trade in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>For the most part she trades in Foreign
Commodities; except some Manufactures of their
own; as Ticking, Bedding, Tartan, Pladding,
Scots-Cloth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> So that <HI>Leith</HI> for Trade,
with her Merchandize for Treasure, excels
most, if not all the Maritime Ports in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray what other Accommodation hath
she?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="211" REF="127">
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has Fish and Flesh in abundance, <HI>viz.</HI>
Oysters, Cockles, Muscles, Crabs, Craw-fish,
Lobsters, Soles, Plaice, Turbet, Thornback,
Cod, Keeling, Haddock, Mackrel, Herring, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Then there's Salmon, Trout, Pike, Perch, Eel,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> but their Flesh are Beeves, Veals, Porks,
Veneson, Kid, Mutton, Lamb, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And their
Fowl are Eagles, Signets, Hawks, Geese, Gos|sander,
Duck and Mallard, Teal, Widgeon,
Cock, Pidgeon, Heath-game, Moorfowl, Cur|lue,
Partridg, Pheasant, Plover Grey and
Green, and many more that I cannot remember.
So great is their Plenty and Variety, that did
not the popularity in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> render things
more chargeable than other Parts more remote
up the Country, a Man might live almost with|out
Expence. And now we relinquish the
flourishing Ports of <HI>Leith,</HI> whose Foundations
are daily saluted by the Ocean. O how sweetly
the Weather smiles, the Horizon looks clear,
the Sky is serene, and the Birds you may see
them beat the ambient Air with their tunable
Notes. Come <HI>Theophilus,</HI> let us mount our
Horses, and lift up your Eyes to behold those
lofty Imbellishments of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are obvious enough, half an Eye
may see them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Welcome to these elevated Ports, the
princely Court of famous <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> This
City stands upon a mighty scopulous Mountain,
whose Foundations are cemented with Mortar
and Stone; where the bulk of her lofty Build|ings
represent it a Rock at a reasonable Di|stance,
fronting the approaching Sun; whose
Elevations are seven or eight Stories high,
<PB N="212" REF="128">
mounted aloft in the ambient Air. But the
Length, as I take it, exceeds not one Mile, and
the Breadth on't measures little more than half
a Mile; nor is there more than one fair Street,
to my best remembrance. But then it's large
and long, and very spacious, whose Ports are
splendid, so are her well-built Houses and Pa|laces,
corresponding very much to compleat it
their Metropolis.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What Fabrick is that on the East of
<HI>Edinburgh?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Hallirood</HI> House, the Regal Court of
<HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>But there's yet another great Fabrick,
that presents Westward.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's <HI>Edinburgh</HI>-Castle, elevated in the
Air, on an impregnable Precipice of rocky
Earth, perpendicular in some Parts, rampir'd
and barrocadoed with thick Walls of Stone,
and Graffs proportionable, to contribute an
additional Strength. So that you are to consi|sider
this inaccessible Castle shines from a natu|ral
as well as an artificial Product; because part
of it you see contiguous with the Rock; but
the other part, because affixed by cemented
Stone, which inoculates and incorporates them so
firmly together, that the whole mass of Build|ing
is of such incredible Strength, that it's al|most
fabulous for any Man to report it, or sum
up the impregnable Lustre and Beauty of this
fair Fortress, that defies all Attempts, except
Famine, Disease, or Treachery be conduct; so
that Culverins and Cannons signify but little,
without Bombs and Carcasses. On the other
hand the Defendants must not be too liberal,
<PB N="213" REF="128">
lest their Water forsake them sooner than their
Ammunition; so inevitably draw upon them
the foregoing Consequence, and incommode
them with a thousand Inconveniences. True it
is, many Arguments of Art and Artillery have
been sent to examine this impregnable Castle,
but none were ever found more successful than
Hunger and Disease, or the golden Apples of
the <HI>Hesperides.</HI> Such kind of Magnets muzzle
Mercenaries, and make them a golden Bridg to
pass over.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this fair Fabrick the Parliament-House,
where the Grandees sit on National Affairs?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, this is their Palace where the Par|liament
sits to accommodate the Kingdom;
whose famous Ports we now relinquish to take
a review of the Bars of <HI>Musselburg.</HI> But that
on our right Hand is delicate <HI>Dalkeith,</HI> sur|rounded
with a Park; and that on our left
Hand is <HI>Preston-pans,</HI> where the Natives make
Salt from the Brine of the Ocean. That other
Town before us is the Corporation of <HI>Had|dington;</HI>
and this is the <HI>Brill;</HI> but the <HI>Bass</HI> you
may see is a prodigious Rock, that makes an
Island on the Skirts of the Ocean.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is this the Place where the <HI>Solon</HI> Geese
breed, that are Flesh in Hand, but Fish in the
Mouth? a Mystery I fancy not inferiour to the
Barnicle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You say true, it's a great Mystery, if se|riously
to consider the Footsteps of Nature;
which I shall explain without a Paradox. Do
but observe that elevated Rock that breaks
the Air, in that seeming solitary floating
Island; it's upon that Rock, and only there,
<PB N="214" REF="129">
that she hatches and initiates her young Ones in|to
the World, by exposing her Egg to the open
Air, and the utmost extremity of stormy
Winds; and those Eggs, or the Squirts (with
other Fowls) are so fix'd by contact of a
glutinous Specimen to the remote Points
of the Rocks, that they seem conglutinated,
and so intirely inoculated, as that no extre|mity
of Weather can separate them asunder,
and where the Female never hatches more than
one single Egg at once: and that Egg she plants
so evenly in the Web of her Foot, by placing
her Body exactly over it; that when she relin|quisheth
the Rock for Relief, with admirable
Circumspection she raises her self, by cauti|ously
dilating her Web, as the <HI>Aspry</HI> does
to circulate the Air, who after the same Me|thod
as when she leaves her Egg, so she falls by
circulating the Air, and dilating her Web in
the same order and decorum as above; with
such an exact poize and evenness of Body to
cover her Egg, that no Art nor Industry can
imitate or accomplish. So that the Egg no
sooner sprits, but it tumbles down into the
brinish Ocean for Nature to nourish it. After
this manner she hatcheth her young Ones; and
after this manner I am authorized to publish it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>So much for Geese, this was a Rarity
indeed; but not so eminently remarkable as the
six great Patriots of the English Nation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You push too hard upon me, however I'll
name them and no more: there were four great
<HI>Harries</HI> (viz.) <HI>Ireton, Vane, Nevill</HI> and <HI>Martin,</HI>
and one marvelous <HI>Andrew,</HI> or <HI>Andrew Mar|vel.</HI></P>

<SP>
<PB N="215" REF="129">
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still here is but Five, what's become of
the Sixth?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will find him at <HI>Dunbar</HI> swadling
the Scots.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! <HI>England</HI>'s great General, the most
renowned, valorous, and victorious Conqueror,
<HI>Oliver Cromwel.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that was he that swing'd off the
Scots in those solitary Planes, and swelling
Hills, near the Ports of <HI>Dunbar:</HI> there it was
that <HI>Cromwel</HI> and <HI>Lesly</HI> disputed by dint of
Sword, and the formidable Terror of Gun|shot,
in which fatal Engagement the Scots were
routed, and fled the Field; whilst the Conque|ror's
Army sprinkled the Earth with bloody
Sacrifices; converting the green Meadows into
purple Planes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>And did not that great General then
take in <HI>Tamtallon</HI>-Castle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Presently after he did; and that's the
Place; how do you like it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, I fancy it a Place but of lit|tle
Strength.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>However it covers the Pass of <HI>Copperspeth,</HI>
that we now pass through to ascend these dirty
miry Moors, which direct to the beautiful Bat|tlements
of <HI>Berwick,</HI> an English Town upon
Scotish Ground, whose Banks are bath'd with
the sturdy Torrents of <HI>Tweed,</HI> that descend
from a mountainous Elevation, in or near to
<HI>Erricksteen;</HI> distant about some eight or nine
Miles from the famous <HI>Tintaw,</HI> whose eminent
Ascents face the English Frontiers, standing on
the Borders or South Marshes of <HI>Scotland.</HI> So
that from <HI>Erricksteen,</HI> though some alledg from
<PB N="216" REF="130">
<HI>Tintaw,</HI> runs the glittering and resolute Streams
of <HI>Tweed.</HI></P>
<P>However <HI>Tintaw</HI> is a prodigious Mountain,
whose lofty Broaches break the burdned Clouds.
And such is <HI>Errick,</HI> if Fame be a true Oracle,
that spouts forth three large and spacious Ri|vers
that wash the pleasant Banks of <HI>Scotland;</HI>
one of them is <HI>Tweed</HI> (as above express'd) that
runs East directly to the Town of <HI>Berwick,</HI> and
espouseth her self with the Ocean there; glid|ing
along the English Promontories, and is the
Original of <HI>Tweed</HI>'s Dale. Another River
is <HI>Annon,</HI> that bathes the fertil and florid Banks
of <HI>England,</HI> and creates a Dale, called <HI>Annon</HI>'s
Dale; so glides along towards the quaking
Sands; and not far from <HI>Carlisle</HI> lancheth forth
into the Ocean. But the third is <HI>Cloyd,</HI> and
is the last mentioned; yet is it nothing inferi|or
to any of the former. This River directs
her Course North and by West, towards the
lofty and domineering Turrets of <HI>Dumbarton;</HI>
near unto those famous Elevations she mingles
her Streams with the profound Depths of the
Ocean, and is the Author of <HI>Cloyd</HI>'s <HI>Dale.</HI></P>
<P>Now all these spacious and peremptory Ri|vers,
are derived from the Springs in the Moun|tain
of <HI>Errick;</HI> but some alledg from <HI>Tintaw,</HI>
on whose Top stands a Capsula, on the Front
of the Hill directing Southward; from whence
those smaller Streams separate themselves,
through craggy Passages and Cavities in Rocks;
so trickling down, they sprinkle the moorish
Meadows, admitting of many other small Rills
and Rivulets to mingle with them, in their
more resolute Passage.</P>

<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>What have you there?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>An <HI>Aenigma</HI> of the famous <HI>Tintaw;</HI>
which with much difficulty I procured from the
Collections of a Scots Antiquary, that lived
sometime in the Town of <HI>Kilsieth;</HI> who to
answer my Solicitations concerning <HI>Tintaw,</HI>
gave me, as you may read, this following
Paradox.
<Q><L>On <HI>Tintaw</HI> Top thar dwells a Mist;</L>

<P>It is a Riddle, and stuff'd with Varieties;

travel those solitary Tracts; or solicit Acquain|tance
with some of our solent Society. And
now <HI>Scotland</HI> I bid thee farewel, to advance
Great <HI>Britain</HI>'s Southern Territories, (the Mag|net)
only <HI>Berwick</HI> upon <HI>Tweed</HI> we select for this
Night's accommodation, where we need not

us, whilst <HI>Nottingham,</HI> that Non such, doth
sweeten our Ears with delicious Consorts, &amp; our
Eyes with variety of Buildings, that stand in a
serene and wholsom Air. But their Cellarage,
beyond compare, is the best in <HI>England,</HI> and
most commodious, and the whole Town situated
on a pleasant Rock; where the Streets are a|dorned
with beautiful Houses, the florid Fields
fill'd with sweet <HI>Aroma</HI>'s; and the exuberant

<P><HI>Rome</HI> was not built in a Day, nor are

it's good and wholsome Advice, <HI>to look before we

<PB N="219" REF="131">

I cannot say where to settle, but am
desirous my Lot may fall in or near to the Fo|rest

pursuit after Recreation? Besides, it will
sweeten our Lives with the life-touches of Ver|tue,

best conduce to the present Occasion; as also
for our future Advantage. As for example;

when returning from <HI>Trent</HI> triumphant with

out one anothers Bowels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>It's true, I acknowledg that Sin, like a
Cart-rope, draws down Destruction on every
Generation: And is not that Generation ripe
enough for Destruction, where the Streets are
storm'd with Oaths and Impieties; and the
Houses blackned with blasphemous Imprecati|ons;
not a Sin cruciated, nor a Lust mortified?
Surely that Nation stands a tip-toe that leans
upon the rotten Props of Pride; and will not
Pride (think you) sink it self, so inevitably fall
with its own Weight? Look but upon the
Foundation of National Piety; and you'l see
how it lies in the arms of National Polity.
Will this suppress the Vice of the Times, and
work a Reformation in Religion and good Man|ners,
such as cruciat Christ every Day, vilifie
Christianity, by putting Christ to open Shame,
and a rape upon Conscience to gratify their
Luxury. So not only endangers themselves,
but that Nation, and those Natives so unhappy
to live with them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Though a spark of Fire shine bright, yet
every shining Spark is not a Star; nor does the
orderly laying the Sacrifice on the Altar, me|rit
the descent of Fire from Heaven to kindle
it: that Man that acts by the Law of his Lust,
imprisons his Faith, and murders his Reason.
<PB N="221" REF="132">
There is a Generation of Men that call the sa|cred
Scriptures a <HI>Scare-Crow</HI> of Religion, to
frighten People from the Duties of Christia|nity;
nay they'l tell you, that Faith, Hope and
Charity, are useless Instruments and Arguments
to explain the Mind of God: but such Men ap|prove
themselves Proficients of Hell, that run
besides the Text to become disobedient to all
the Commandments. Man blown up with the
blast of Ambition, makes it a Rule of Faith to
study Revenge; so puts a Sword to his own
Throat, and yet cries out some other hurts
him. Hypocrites of all Men are dip'd in the
deepest Die, and doom'd to a lower Hell than
either Scribe or Pharisee: whilst the more Re|ligious
contemplate Vision, and seek the Sera|phick
Life of Angels, which inclines me to an
Hermetick Life, that speaks more Piety than
Pageantry; more Religion than Prophaneness;
more Services than Sacrifices; more Adoration
to God, than to Temples built with Hands.

her tottering Battlements. And such is the

Pilgrim; or rather an infirm Penitent, that
moves slowly and creeps to his Grave; so do
her antient Ruins slide into Dust: these are her
Ports, if you please let us enter. Near to this
<HI>Alnwick</HI> runs the River <HI>Aln,</HI> or rather a Rivulet.

<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is <HI>Durham</HI> (and a Palatinate) where
you may see an eminent but antient Cathedral,
begirt with the self-same Wall that encircles
the Town; whose Foundations are wash'd with
the Streams of <HI>Weer;</HI> and where the Palaces
are pleasant, and in some parts Beautiful, be|cause
shadowed with Art, and polish'd with
Industry. Nay the whole Country presents a
Scene of Pleasure, because plentifully stock'd
with Corn and Cattle. Moreover it is very well
supplied with Coal, but not to ballance with
the stock of <HI>Newcastle.</HI></P>

<P>Whereabouts are we now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our Course directs us to dirty <HI>Darling|ton,</HI>
and that's a Town that stands in stiff Clay,
yet centred in a plentiful part of a Country.
More Southward yet, and about some three
Miles off, glide the glittering Streams of the
River <HI>Tee,</HI> whose Fords are furnish'd with in|comparable
Trout, as are her Deeps with the
race of Salmon. But our next Post-stage is
the Town of <HI>North-Ollerton,</HI> (a Northern Si|tuation)
famous for nothing that I know of,
except a weather-beaten Castle, demolish'd with
<PB N="224" REF="134">
Age, and the Ruins of Time; which serves as
a Reception now for Bats and Buzards, Owls
and Jack-daws. However the Town stands
sweetly situated in a rich Soil, and fertil Fields;
witness her plenty of Corn, and her fair and
large-headed Cattle. More Southward yet,
and about some seven Miles from hence, stands
the Town of <HI>Topliff;</HI> but at the South end of
the Town stands a Bridg of Stone, that strad|dles
over the sullen <HI>Swale.</HI> There is little re|markable
here besides the River, except the
Soil and solitary Meadows.</P>

<P>Why now we are come to <HI>Burrough-Brigs;</HI>
at the North end thereof runs the River
<HI>Yor,</HI> into which falls the trembling Streams of
<HI>Neid;</HI> so incorporating together, they gulf in|to
<HI>Owse.</HI> In these solitary Fields, there stand
seven great prodigious Stones, elevated like
Pyramids in the ambient Air, of such vast Mag|nitude
(and regular Proportion) that they
strike deep Impressions into the solid Body of
Earth. I curiously enquired after the meaning
of these Reliques, but no Man was found to an|swer
my Inquisitions: from whence I conclud|ed
these signal Remembrances might remain as
Trophies or Monuments of Victory; and that
the Natives and Inhabitants that dwelt there|abouts,
but little busied themselves to rifle into
Records. Further than this, I can give no ac|count.</P>

<P>Whereabouts stands <HI>York?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>The City of <HI>York</HI> stands distant from
these pleasant Fields, about some seven or eight
Northern Miles: the Foundation of whose flou|rishing
<PB N="225" REF="134">
Ports are washed with the mild and mo|derate
Waves of the Navigable <HI>Owse;</HI> whose
owsy Shores, and silent sullied Streams mingle
themselves with the more resolute Torrents of
<HI>Trent,</HI> and so gulph into the spacious Arms of
<HI>Humber.</HI> In this City you shall see a sumptuous
Cathedral, imbellished with Art and polish'd
Stone: every one that sees it, admires and
commends it; and so do I for a rare Piece of
Art, and a beautiful Fabrick.</P>

<P>It's never the worse, nor is <HI>Weatherbee</HI>
neither, through which runs <HI>Warff;</HI> where there
stands a stately Bridg of Stone, over those
rocky Foundations that secure her scaly Inha|bitants,
<HI>viz.</HI> the Trout and Salmon. From
hence we fadg to <HI>Ferry-Brigs;</HI> but in our Pas|sage,
we meet with a knotty stony Cawsy that
accommodates the Traveller, when the Banks
o'reflow those florid Meadows. About three
Miles Southward there runs a Rivulet, but I
call it a Rill, that gives name to the Town;
where note, the Inhabitants call it <HI>Went-Bridg.</HI></P>

<P>Whereabouts are we now?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>On the Skirts of <HI>Doncaster,</HI> so called
from the River <HI>Dun,</HI> portable sometimes to
the Verge of the Town; at other times hardly
Water enough to turn a Mill, or float a Cock|boat.
It's a Corporation, and a Manufacture;
if weaving and knitting Stockings, and Wast|coats
will warrant it: Now you must know
that this Town stands in the Post-road&punc; where
a Man may be welcome that brings Money; o|therwise
he may step by the Borders of <HI>Bawtry,</HI>
<PB N="226" REF="135">
and consult the melancholy Streams of <HI>Idle,</HI>
whose Banks are burdned with Segs and Bul|rushes.
But these glittering Streams over which
we now pass, flow from the Sharps of merry
<HI>Merial.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then we touch on the Skirts of the
Forest.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have pass'd through the Heart on't;
for now we discover the weather-beaten Walls,
and the ruinous Battlements of the Town of
<HI>Newark,</HI> whose flourishing Fields are bath'd
with the slippery Streams of silver <HI>Trent,</HI> that
glides along through the fragrant Fields, to
wash the Foundation of her florid Meadows;
so tumbles down, but with a soft and murmur|ing
Noise, from her more remote and Wester|ly
Fountains. Thus <HI>Trent</HI> slides along through
diversified Mixtures, and various Soils, (besides
polite and glittering Sands) amalgamiz'd with
marly Oakry Earths, Alabaster Rocks, red and
discoloured Clays, and polish'd Pavements of
transparent Stones. So that from the West,
with a strong and swift Current, <HI>Trent</HI> drinks
up the torpid surly <HI>Sow</HI> that floats near the
Walls of the Town of <HI>Stafford.</HI> And then the
timorous <HI>Tame</HI> falls in, that glides below the
Town of <HI>Tamworth:</HI> the silent <HI>Dove</HI> also, that
melts the smiling Banks of <HI>Tidbury,</HI> mingles her
Streams with <HI>Trent</HI> below <HI>Monk</HI>'s Bridg. And
the resolute <HI>Darwin</HI> that salutes the Ports of
<HI>Derby,</HI> falls into <HI>Trent</HI> below <HI>Wilden-Ferry.</HI> So
the sullen <HI>Soar</HI> that leads through <HI>Leicester,</HI> glides
into <HI>Trent</HI> near to <HI>Red Hill.</HI> Besides, the
little <HI>Leen,</HI> whose limpid Streams wash the
beautiful Rocks and the Shores of <HI>Nottingham,</HI>
<PB N="227" REF="135">
she also pays Tribute at <HI>Trent</HI>-Bridge, and the
smooth faced <HI>Snite</HI> that scours the Vale of <HI>Bel|voir,</HI>
slides into <HI>Trent</HI> near the sandy Foundations
of <HI>Newark.</HI> But nearer the Marshes falls in the
<HI>Merial;</HI> so does the <HI>Idle</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Axholm.</HI>
The portable Streams of <HI>Owse</HI> also salute the
Torrents of <HI>Trent,</HI> before her espousals with
the spacious <HI>Humber;</HI> for till then <HI>Trent</HI> retains
her Original Name, notwithstanding the vari|ous
and complicated mixture of Streams, which
are many more that glide into <HI>Trent,</HI> and would
swell my Volume if but to name them.</P>
</SP>

<HI>Newark.</HI></P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Newark,</HI> you may see her Antient Ports
stoop with Age, and her Bulwarks lie buried in
sandy Earth, and amalgamiz'd together with the
surface of the Soil, whose Banks are saluted with
the Torrents of <HI>Trent,</HI> and whose sandy Foun|dations,
and cultivated Fields sweetned with
the Fragrances of her Florid Meadows, adorn
the North; but most pleasant and delectable
Pastures adorn the East, whilst her Southern
Fields are fill'd with the Treasures of Corn; be|sides
the Fertility of the Flourishing Vale of <HI>Bel|voir</HI>
supplies her Granaries; as her Western
fragrant Meadows reach up to <HI>Nottingham.</HI> So
that upon the matter this Town of <HI>Newark</HI> (but
not <HI>Noahs-Ark</HI>) is besieged with Plenty.</P>
<P>In the Center of this Town is an exact Pave|ment,
Quadrangular, Regular, Uniform and
Spacious; and in the Center of this Center stands
a Market-house, piazza'd or bolstred up with
Wooden Props, commoded with a Roof of Lead
<PB N="228" REF="136">
and Tile; but the general scope of this fair
Pavement requires a more exact method of Pen
than mine is, to describe it. For that end I pro|ceed
to some other particulars, as their Gates;
because when to consider that this Town of
<HI>Newark</HI> (to my Observation) has but one fair
Street, which is called by the Name of <HI>Tod|man-Street;</HI>
but the Gates are <HI>Miln-gate, Middle-gate,
Kirk-gate, Castle-gate, Nor-gate, Appleton-gate,
Barnby-gate, Bolderton-gate</HI> and <HI>Carter-gate.</HI>
There is also <HI>Beamont-Cross, Potter-Dike, Hell-end,</HI>
and <HI>Cotes-Bridg.</HI></P>
<P>From the South-West end of this Maiden Ga|rison,
stood the Queen's Sconce, facing the <HI>Trent,</HI>
but the King's Sconce (or Sconce Royal) was to
the Eastward. So that the whole Town seemed
almost Invincible, (as it was Defensible) because
so well defended with Men, Arms, Ammuniti|on
and Artillery, besides such deep Grafts, Ba|stions,
Horns, Half-Moons, Counter-scarps,
Redoubts, Pit-falls, and an impregnable Line
of Sadd and Turff, palizadoed and stockaded,
and every Fort so furnished with great Guns and
Cannon, that this bulky Bulwark of <HI>Newark</HI>
represented to the Besiegers but one entire
Sconce; and the two Royal Forts, the formida|ble
Flankers: Nor was there a Tree to hinder
her prospect.</P>
<P>At the North end of <HI>Newark,</HI> supervising the
<HI>Trent,</HI> (and her redolent Meadows) stands to this
Day the Relicks and Ruins of a fair Castle,
whose solid Foundations were cemented with
Stone; and all the Walls, Buttresses and Battle|ments
with the same Material; whose imbelli|shed
Front overlook'd the fragrant Meadows of
<PB N="229" REF="136">
<HI>Trent,</HI> and was the last reception for King <HI>Iohn;</HI>
who after his return from <HI>Swinsted-Abby</HI> (where
the Monk poisoned him) lodg'd within the
Portals of this fair Palace. There it was that he
seal'd the Decrees of Death that compell'd him
to take leave of the World. Another Curiosity is
their Collegiate Church, beautified and garni|shed
with fair Free-stone. The Quire or Body,
and the Isles, very large and spacious; the Roof
covered all over with Lead, but the Broach and
Tower excels in height, because to vie with
most Parochial Churches in <HI>England.</HI> This
Maiden Garison had her Ports guarded with
Artillery (as above exprest) and was made
equal in success with the most fortunate Gari|sons
relating to the Royal Interest.</P>
<P>Here are four Fairs quarterly proclaimed e|very
Year by the Mayor and Aldermen of the
Town of <HI>Newark;</HI> besides the Weak-day Mar|ket,
and a running Trade with the Country
round about them. From the North come
those large and fair fronted Cattle, that fill
<HI>Newark</HI> Folds; and on Wednesday every
Week their Market is duly observed, where
you may see this large Pavement as 'twere over|spread
and crouded with Corn, and the Sham|bles,
as any Market in the County, furnish'd with
Flesh: Besides in the very front of this general
Exchange, the Stalls are as well burden'd with
Fish. Moreover, Fowl, with Fruits, and many
other Entertainments, they have in abundance.
But now I think it high time to relinquish the
Ports of <HI>Newark,</HI> to scale the famous Ascents of
<HI>Trent,</HI> whose generous Streams invite us West|ward.</P>

<P>There was none beyond it Northward,
and I'm sure Southward there was none compa|rable

Town of <HI>Newark,</HI> as we ride along, you may
observe mighty blough Banks, and incompara|ble
Deeps, with pleasant slaty and secure Fords,
polished with Gravel, and enamel'd with Sand;
but in some other parts, you shall observe but lit|tle
disproportion betwixt the Surface of Earth,
and the Level of <HI>Trent;</HI> when on a sudden a|gain,
some knotty Coagulum of incrustated Earth
(sometimes Rocky and sometimes Marley) steps
up to secure the Continent, and rebuke her
swelling murmuring Streams, seemingly discon|tent
to leave the amorous Shores in their more
rapid and violent precipitation.</P>

silent Streams, as her Meadows are enrich'd with
the soveraign Soil of <HI>Trent,</HI> that makes glad
her Inhabitants. So that from <HI>Farnton</HI> about a
Mile or two stands <HI>Stoak</HI> in a sweet Soil, whose
Banks and shady Bowers are perpetually bathed
with the solitary gliding Streams of <HI>Trent,</HI> that
smile on her florid Fields, whilst the beautiful
fragrant Meadows are constantly courted with
soft Salutes and Embracements from the mild

<P>Pleasant do you say! do but propound
what Pleasure is, and see if any place in <HI>England</HI>
excels it. This is the place that's call'd <HI>Hazel|ford-Clift,</HI>
from a stately imbellished flourishing
Wood, that borders South on the side of <HI>Trent,</HI>
that climbs up a Rocky and Mountanous Eleva|tion,
facing the North, and the delectable Shades
of the Forest of <HI>Sherwood;</HI> whose beautiful
Banks and delightful Shores, are celebrated to
the pleasant Amours of <HI>Trent,</HI> defended on the
South by the Vale of <HI>Belvoir,</HI> and guarded from
the North by the shady Trees of the Forest:
but her East is refresh'd by fragrant Meadows,
cultivated Fields, and delightful Pastures, ador|ned
with most excellent Rills, Rivulets and
Fountains. This is our inamouring Northern
Prospect, the Anglers <HI>Arcadia,</HI> the greatest <HI>Avi|ary,</HI>
and the most mellifluous Consort in <HI>Notting|ham-Shire.</HI>
Nay, it's <HI>England</HI>'s <HI>Elizium,</HI> if <HI>Eli|zium</HI>
be any where. Of which if any doubt to
trace or find out, it's here to be found, if any

<P>This Town we call <HI>Knieton;</HI> it stands yet
more West, elevated on a Rocky Precipice of
Albaster, and red Marly Earth, hovering over
the Streams of <HI>Trent;</HI> and borders on the skirts
of the Vale of <HI>Belvoir,</HI> facing the Forest; and
<HI>Bridgeford</HI> lies much on the same Level, West
<PB N="232" REF="138">
South-West, guarded with Rocks and stately
Mountains, opposite as I take it to the Inunda|tions
of <HI>Trent.</HI> But the Town of <HI>Gunthorp</HI> stands
directly North, blest with flourishing and florid
Meadows; whose Fragrancy oftimes perfumes
the Shores, as <HI>Trent</HI>'s proud Waves besprinkle
her Sands. <HI>Shelford</HI> you may see inclines yet
more Westward, whose Foundations I have consi|dered
lie so low and flat, that they level the very
Surface of <HI>Trent;</HI> but <HI>Burton</HI> and <HI>Bulcoat</HI> stand
North of her Ruins, and are shaded by the

adorns the South: From whose beautiful
Elevations we discover the Battlements, and
some part of the Situations of famous <HI>Notting|ham;</HI>

glut the Scickle, and satiate the Sithe.</P>

<P>Grant my Allowances, and I'll give you

<HI>Trent</HI> surpasseth <HI>Tagus,</HI> notwithstanding the
boast of her Golden Sands; whose transparent
and translucid Streams, strike deep Impressions,
and ravishing refreshing Resentments, inviting
the Contemplative Angler to consider the plen|ty,
and the great variety that are daily drag'd
forth out of her bountiful and well furnished
Streams, enough one would think to cause Ad|miration,
which formerly I could never believe:
But now I'm convinced beyond opposition.</P>

<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay 'tis true, and I can tell you more;
that <HI>Speed</HI> and <HI>Cambden,</HI> both of Authentick Au|thority,
will also tell you, that the swelling breasts
of admired <HI>Trent,</HI> hourly relieve thirty sorts of
Fish; and that her Arms embrace as many Mar|ket-Towns,
and as many Castles are implanted
on her cultivated Suburbs; and that thirty Ri|vers
also mingle themselves with <HI>Trent</HI>'s more re|solute
and sturdy Streams, and with the loss
only of their Virgin Names: Which report if
any one question it, you shall find recorded in
Voluminous History. But had they practically
and experimentally consulted <HI>Trent,</HI> as my self
(and some others) have done, they had with|out
dispute met with more variety of Fish than
they inserted, or modestly included in their
publick Impressions.</P>

<P>That's strange; pray untie the knot.</P>

prove that, that every Angler frequently expe|riments,
if he but take pains to examine her
Fords, or seriously peruses this Catalogue of
Fish; where he shall find twenty two sorts of
edible Fish that daily accost the Silver Streams
of <HI>Trent.</HI> Now the rest you are to consider, es|pecially
some of them are never to be dealt with
by the trembling Rod, nor the feeble force of a
slender Line. Such Fish, I must confess, as are
more than ordinarily resolute, are doom'd to
die by the Law of the noosy Net.</P>

to Solitudes and Experience, we may
mingle Rewards among our Recreations, and
sweeten our Labours and Industry with Divine
Contemplation; a Study the indigent World
is ignorant of. What are these! the stupendous
Fabricks of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> whose Foundations are
laid in Rocky Sand, and so firmly rivited into the
Bowels of the Earth, that neither Age nor Time
can hardly decay them? And was this that im|pregnable
Castle, elevated on a Rock, and lifted
up so high as to storm the Air, and supervise the
bordering Inhabitants that dwell in the florid
Vale of <HI>Belvoir?</HI> Was this that great Ornament
that adorn'd the Country, that sleeps now in
dust?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="236" REF="140">
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>These are the Relicks of that famous
Antiquity, where Art and Industry discovered
themselves inseparable Companions. Let us ap|proach
her beautiful Ports, inrich'd with three
Parish Churches; but one of them of late was
torn in pieces with Martial Treats. But to
speak the Truth, it was by provocation: For
the Pulpit you must know vied with the Peerage
for Superiority; and that made the Souldiers
commit Sacrilege, and undress this beautiful Re|lick,
that lies now in silence, and hudled in
ashes becomes her own Sepulchre. Now the
Cellerage in these Situations of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> are
the most commodious that I know in <HI>England;</HI>
whose descents you may trace twenty or thirty
Foot from the surface of the Soil. But there
are other Cellars that almost court Day, where
they make their Malt, and lodg Commodities
either for a Domestick or Foreign Trade.
For so great is the Plenty she draws from the
breasts of the Country, that were she wanting
in her self, they would want themselves in want|ing
her. Another Rarity it behoves the Reader
to observe; and that is, upon examination her
Wells will be found as deep, if not in some pla|ces
deeper, than their Cellars. Yet amongst all
her stately Imbellishments, we petrole as I re|member
but two fair Streets; the rest are Gates,
Allies, Rows, Lanes, Marshes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the
Prospect as we advance, presents to the South,
and the generous Streams of Silver <HI>Trent,</HI> di|recting
to the <HI>Leen-Bridg,</HI> facing the hollow
Stone; or rather, as I may term them, habi|table
Rocks, through which we ascend to
consult those splendid Inhabitants, that live
<PB N="237" REF="140">
under a well-polished Government, and those
other Circumstantials of Civility and Ingenu|ity.</P>
<P>Now this Avenue of <HI>Fishergate,</HI> we leave on
our right hand; and that on our left, is the
Marshes, as we ascend to climb up the hollow
Stone, and mount the Elevations of a large
and spacious Street, called the <HI>High Pavement:</HI>
but <HI>Stony-Street</HI> and <HI>Pepper-Street,</HI> are all the
Streets in <HI>Nottingham.</HI> The rest are either
Lanes or Gates: as <HI>Mary-Gate, Pilcher-Gate,
Fletcher-Gate, Well-Gate, Boyard-Lane, Swine|green,
Saint-Iones</HI>'s, and <HI>Hockly</HI> in the <HI>Hole, &amp;c.</HI>
But the Week-day Shambles we leave on our
right hand; and on our left, those sandy Foun|dations
that face the South; whose Skirts are
moistned with the generous <HI>Leen,</HI> and there live
the Tanners, Tawyers, Fell-mongers, Parch|ment
and Vellum-dressers, besides the Glutiners,
that dwell in Houses contiguous with the Rocks;
but the Buildings are not under-ground, though
stooping so low as to level some part of the
very surface, refresh'd with fragrant Aromas,
sent from the florid Meadows of <HI>Trent.</HI> But this
<HI>Terra Nova,</HI> or <HI>Terra Incognita,</HI> they generally
call it the Narrow-Marsh.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now we descend to the lower Pavement,
by dividing the Town-Hall from the Leaden
Well, near unto which the Week-day Cross
is frequently crowded with Country Curiosities:
but advancing forward in a direct line, we en|counter
the Fronteers of <HI>Castle-gate,</HI> and leave
the broad Marsh, and <HI>Grayfrier-gate</HI> on our left
hand. Towards the upper end of which, and
<PB N="238" REF="141">
not far from <HI>Hungate,</HI> stood the Imbellishments
of <HI>Nicholas</HI> Church, associating with some in|considerable
Lanes, Allies and Caves; but in|clining
yet more Westward, and nearer the
Castle, remain the Bogholes, and the Brew|house-yard.
But I forgot to tell you, that in
the very Centre, or Division of the Pavement,
there stands a Bow (or a fair Port) opposite to
<HI>Bridle-smith</HI>-Gate; adjoining to which, is
<HI>Girdle-smith</HI>-Gate; and next unto that, is <HI>Peter</HI>-Gate,
a derivative from the Church that fronts
the West Angle, and directs into <HI>Hungate.</HI> But
presupposing your Station at the North end of
<HI>Bridle-smith</HI>-Gate; immediately then you face
<HI>Hen</HI>-Cross, which in a direct line leads on to
<HI>Cow-lane</HI>-Bar; but if otherwise you incline to
the Left, then you leave the Saturday Shambles,
the Fruiterers and the Cage on your right
Hand, and <HI>Peck-lane</HI> that directs to <HI>Peter</HI>'s
Church, on your left; but if pointing your
Passage towards the Western Angle, you then
enter the Sands, and also the Sheep-Market,
which is commonly kept upon <HI>Timber</HI>-hill.</P>
<P>Now advancing more Westward, you enter
the <HI>Friers,</HI> but on the left Hand of your En|trance,
is <HI>Wheeler-gate;</HI> and on your Right, is
the Beast-market that fronts the <HI>Long-Row,</HI> in|to
which, and from the Skirts of the Forest,
there presents a small Avenue, some call it
<HI>Sheep-lane;</HI> opposite to which is Saint <HI>Iohn's-Lane,</HI>
but that descends in a direct Line, either
from the Castle, or <HI>Boston</HI>-Bridg; so that the
Ornament, Gaity and Beauty, is the <HI>Long-Row.</HI>
Beauty did I say? all the Town is a Beauty, if
you consider her stately Buildings. Now as you
<PB N="239" REF="141">
pass through the <HI>Long-Row,</HI> it directs to <HI>Bar-gate.</HI>
On the left Hand of whose ruinous An|tiquities,
and upon a rising Elevation of Ground,
the Standard Royal was advanced by <HI>Charles</HI>
the First, near to the Reliques and Remains of
that sumptuous Castle, not far from the ob|scurements
of <HI>Mortimer's-hole.</HI> I must confess
there needs no great Noise to trumpet the Fame
of this Non-such <HI>Nottingham,</HI> whose plenty,
if I mistake not, fills every neighbouring Coun|ty;
and whose generous Breasts recruit not
only Travellers and Foreigners, but send sup|plies
to all the Villages that border about her;
whose Granaries commode the British Conti|nent;
and whose liberality extended to adja|cent
Parts, interprets <HI>Nottingham</HI> to be no
Town, but rather the inland Mart and Store|house
of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>

<P>It matters not a rush how any Man re|sents

flatulent, my Strain too torpid, my Pen not e|legant,
nor my Stile polite enough to illustrate
the Beauty of such stately Inbellishments, the
admired Subject of every Man's Praise; which
more worthily deserves the Applause of an in|genious
Historiographer, rather than the Cha|racter

have done what I was able to do, and shall now
leave the Scenes for some other to decipher,
that's more intelligible, and capable to per|form
<PB N="240" REF="142">
such a Work than my self. Yet give me
leave once again to drive the Nail a little fur|ther;
when to evince the Dissatisfied that <HI>Not|tingham</HI>
(as prenoted) is no Town, but rather
a beautiful and imbellish'd Seraglio, where
every Street, nay every Port, represents as it
were the new Face of a Court.</P>

<P>Then what if I call it our Northern Star,

and because being bless'd with the Blessings

liv'd without the Vanity of Prodigality, then
would I stile her a Vertue as well as a Beauty;
where Art and Invention have supplies and en|couragement;
and where new Fabricks are
hourly lifted up into the ambient Air. So that
a Man would think her to sprout and vegetate,
by the daily Progress she makes in her Build|ings.
So that when you come to fee her Ar|bours
and Aviaries, so naturally dress'd up in
the Shades of the Forest, and perfum'd with
Fragrancies from the redolent Meadows of
<HI>Trent;</HI> besides the pleasant Prospect it has into
the cultivated Fields in the fruitful Vale of <HI>Bel|voir,</HI>
then would you say that <HI>Nottingham</HI> is the
Magazine for <HI>Cheshire</HI> and <HI>Lancashire;</HI> and the
daily supply of those Mountainous Parts in the
<HI>Peak</HI> of <HI>Derby-shire.</HI> These are those Ports,
where the Angler (and Ingenious) never yet
entred without sober Accommodation, let us
therefore first consult the Virtuoso's of the Rod;
afterwards sweeten our Ears with Rhetorique
from <HI>Apollo.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you have given us a fair and large
Character of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> so have you been as
copious in your practical Experiments of Ang|ling,
and brought to Test the undeniable As|sertions
of Truth, not imaginary Fragments,
nor Romantick Fictions, stoln or suggested by
plundring Plagiaries. Now every one knows
that Ignorance emulates Art; and Impiety a|bove
all things abominates Devotion. Tradi|tion
also that truckles under Forms, and Hy|pocrisy
and Flattery are Time's Apostates: But
Science and Experience are the confirmation of
Eye-sight; and Truth the Standard of Divine
Speculation. By these we proportion the Mea|sures
of Vertue, which is found by him that
treads the Tracks of Wisdom, and wades
through the profound Depths of Patience: for
as he that devotes himself to a solitary Life,
lives a Life most congruous to Devotion; so he
that devotes himself to Piety, lives a Life analo|gous
to Contemplation.</P>
<P>For what signifies the Court, but to remon|strate
the Prince his Magnificence; and the Pa|lace,
but to heighten his Enjoyments? On the
other hand, where Humility is celebrated to
Piety; there Content dwells every-where in an
humble Breast; and Humility and Penitency,
like Links concatinate, content themselves with
the garb of a Cottage. Thus we may read
the State of the World: but that which I al|ways
approved of as the best State, was to seek
the Blessings of Content in every Condition.
Then welcome Woods, Rocks, Rivers, Groves,
Rivulets; nay it's possible the very Shades of a
Forest, in some measure answer to the Com|forts
<PB N="242" REF="143">
of Life; and Life answers to the Ends of
the great Creator. Consider therefore that
the Soul's great Diadem is Christ; and Christ,
by Wisdom and Sanctification every Christian
knows, is God. And who but God created
this stupendous Creation, and drest up this
imbelish'd Fabrick of Heaven and Earth, when
he made the Majesty of his Invisibility visible,
and placed Man in this sublunar Orb, to con|duct
and manage his Fellow-creatures. But
Man imprudently transgressing, in not answer|ing
the glorious Ends of his Divine Creation,
in Obedience to the Commands of the Sove|reign
Decrees of God, the Almighty discharg|ed
him the Soveraignty of Government; so ex|il'd
him from the glorious Sun-shine of Para|dise.

</SP>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Arnoldus his Meditation.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Adam</HI> as an Angel in the Shades of Pa|radise,
typified his Creator: then it was that
this mortal State seemed Immortal; and Man,
because a Signature of this admirable Creation,
<PB N="244" REF="144">
was made to live by that Life that made him;
for it was the Will of the Supreamest that
made him, to shine a Ray of the Majesty upon
him, and generate in him the glorious beauteous
Ray of Himself. But this was done when the
Divine Majesty made Man absolute Lord, and
commissioned him Conduct over all the Crea|tures.
So that <HI>Adam</HI> was now a Divine Substi|tute,
because the Divinity had divinely inspired
him, and stamp'd the Impress of his Royal Sig|net
upon him, the lively Emblem and Character
of Himself; whereby to demonstrate in him a
Sovereign Power over all the Families of Crea|tures
that God had made, and by Wisdom
bless'd in this stupendous Creation. So that
you may read, <HI>Adam</HI> was made in the Likeness
of his Maker; but he begot in his own Likeness.</P>
<P>This was once the blessed State of <HI>Adam,</HI>
and a regenerate State (to be born again in
Spirit) is the same with us now: for Primitive
Purity can never be blotted out by National
Impiety. Nor shall Age, nor Time, nor Death
it self vacate the Lustre and Glory of Christi|anity:
for as the Donation of Purity is the
Royal Act of him that's pure, and lives for e|ver;
so the Piety of Christianity shall out-live
all Ages, to the utmost Limit and Period of
Time. Where note, the Primitive Times have
liv'd till now; and that that begot Time in
the Bosom of Eternity, is <HI>Christ in us the Hope
of Glory.</HI> Why then do Christians violate
their Faith? Does it become us to enslave it by
Lust? A proud Faith is as great a Contradiction,
as an humble Devil. The glorious Hope we
have of Paradise, incites and invites Believers
<PB N="245" REF="144">
to the Duty of Repentance; and Repentance
leads on to a humble Submission, to cruciate our
selves and this temporal State, that naturally
resigns upon every Assault of Death; for all
complicated Elements melt into Obscurity.</P>
<P>Shall the Clay rebel against the Potter that
moulds it? Shall Man resist his Maker that made
him? Shall the Vice of the Times vote against
Heaven? and Impiety provoke us to mutiny
against the Deity? Must we learn no Language
but Oaths and Imprecations? and denounce no
Dialect but the Rhetorick of Hell? Can no
bounds be put to luxurious Ambition? nor any
Limit to the impudent Impostor? who has not
considered the Body sometimes diseased, and
how Death stands ready to blot out the Cha|racter
of Life? so that if ill Symptoms but
happen to invade us, the Grave immediately
stands gaping to devour us. Nor can our
Limbs any sooner be touched with the Cold
and icie Finger of Death, but our vital Fires
begin all to extinguish; and the glorious shining
Sparks of Life look languid and dim; and so
by degrees lose their sparkling Lustre. Then
it is that the natural Artifice of Men and Means
suddenly forsake us, and the secret Subtilties of
our deceitful Hearts basely and cowardly re|nounce
and desert us.</P>
<P>And then it is, that our truckling Faith pro|strates
a false Heart on the cold and frozen
Altar of Despair, which formerly was the
common Factorage, and Receptable of impure
Flames, where we used to offer up adulterated
Sacrifices, with impious Adorations, as the <HI>A|thenians</HI>
did to unknown Gods, prophetically
<PB N="246" REF="145">
Prognosticating our merited Destruction. So
that now in a Clod, or lump of Clay, the lustre
of Life is silently sealed up, and secretly con|veyed
to the Sepulchres of Death; and because
translated from the beauteous Creation, is made
to cease from a natural State, and embrace
Corruption, and the putrid Grave in eternal
silence; where we shall never see Light nor Day
any more, nor with Sorrow or Reluctancy look
back upon the anguish and anxiety of those we
formerly persecuted by unjust Sentences; when
as Judges we sat and perverted Judgment, yet
would seem to appear as Angels of Light. But
strip'd and stark naked the World now inspects
us, and all those Graces that naturally adorn'd
us, discover themselves but personal Deformi|ties.
So that Disease finds as little difficulty to
attempt us, as Death to encounter and over|come
us. For have not our sensual Guards all
declin'd us, and the Arguments of Sense and
Reason revolted from us? Every Instrument
and Organ has reclaim'd its natural Function,
whereby we perceive our selves deserted by the
active shining Motions of Life; and doom'd
to Death by the Law of Sin, we subscribe to the
fatal Decrees of Mortality.</P>
<P>O fatal flattering Impiety, where's all those
specious Pretences of Purity that link'd and in|tail'd
our suborn'd Inclinations to the gaudy
Temptations of luxurious Honour? What if
every Man had the Wealth of a Monarch, and
as great as <HI>Alexander</HI> in Empire and Dominion;
and suppose his Domesticks as numerous as the
World, yet Death would arrest him, and send
him Summons to appear before Heaven's high
<PB N="247" REF="145">
Tribunal, where he must answer for himself,
and not another for him; whilst Conscience,
as a bold and daring Accuser, will accuse him
for the Deeds done here in the Body. So that
as our Work was here upon Earth, such also
will be our Reward in Heaven. But how sad
will it be, when to behold the Portals of the
New <HI>Ierusalem</HI> firmly bolted and barrocaded
against us; when to hear the dreadful and ir|revocable
Sentence of eternal Excommunication
pass upon us, to be utterly secluded Society with
the Saints, and denied Community with the
blessed Angels, that perpetually triumph with
Seraphick Hallelujahs, as the Seraphims and
Cherubims with heavenly Ejaculations, whilst
we are made to grope in Darkness unutterable,
and to lament there the Impiety of Life; and
debar'd Repentance after Death, because to
reject it when proffred unto us: for in the Grave
there's no Contrition; nor after Judgment is
there any Revocation.</P>
<P>This is a sad and deplorable Sentence, be|yond
the reach of Sorrow to contemplate: for
if but to consider the Janglings in Hell, and the
murmuring Complaints of the Damned in Tor|ments,
that belch out Blasphemies to confirm
their Impieties; and by spiritual Pride prophane
the Beauty of Holiness; and would, if pos|sible,
corrupt the Creation, prostituting to I|dols,
and the Ides of Time; and as much as in
them lies, pervert and poison the Sacred Ora|cles
of Judgment and Justice. But what Tongue
can express the glorious Raptures, and beati|fical
Visions the Saints enjoy, with the Seraphick
Harmony of the blessed Hierarchy; whilst Pe|nitents
<PB N="248" REF="146">
pass by the Gates of Hell, to the hea|venly
triumphant Joys of Eternity.</P>
<P>O what Love so convincing and stupendously
manifest, as a Saviour to die for unregenerate
Sinners! to affix himself to the Cross of Death,
to fasten our Souls to Eternal Life! to load his
Body with the Burden of Sin, to purchase for
Sinners the Seal of Redemption! This is that
great and sublime Elixir, that transmutes our
Nature into Divinity, Time into Eternity,
and our Souls into Himself; from which super|eminent
Heavenly State, there's no relaxation,
but an intire Unity and Community with God,
for ever and ever to all Eternity. For as Light
is inseparable from it self, nor can Darkness
co-mingle or incorporate with it; such is the
Soul that is truly sanctified and sprinkled with
the Blood of this Miracle of Mercy, that never
for the future can be separated from its Savi|our:
but as Sin hates the Light, because the
Light discovers its Darkness; so Light, because
it's the Standard of Truth, not only discovers
but dissipates the Darkness. The Lamb of
God is the Light of the World, that for ever
<UNCLEAR>shines</UNCLEAR>, and for ever frees the penitent Soul
from the Shades of Darkness. How great
therefore must that Light be, that enlightneth
the World, and every Man that cometh into
the World?</P>
<P>Now the true State of Felicity is only attain|able
by Faith in Christ; and Faith directs to
the Portals of Humility; Humility to Piety;
and Piety leads on to the Duties of Charity, by
a religious resignation of our inglorious Will, to
the Glory of his Will that bore our Burden of
<PB N="249" REF="146">
Sin on the Cross. Here let us sigh down, if
possible, the Sins of the Age, as Christ by the
virtue of his pure Divinity depress'd those Moun|tains
of Sin in the World: then in obedience
to this great Example, let us cruciate our
selves, the better to enable us to triumph over
Death: for to conquer Self, forceth the Devil
to recoil; and to render the Vanities of this
World contemptible, is to lead Hell and Capti|vity
captive; which none but Christ can do,
and has done: yet ought we to imitate our
Leader, as true Volunteers of the Cross, if we
hope to imbrace the Royal Sanctions of him
that bore his Cross in a bloody Shower, for the
Redemption of Mankind. This I recommend to
the Christian Reader that follows the Lamb the
Captain of our Salvation.</P>

<HEAD>The SALMON.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>As the Salmon is a Monarch and King in
the Freshes, so he is the ultimate Result of the
Angler's Conquest. This Royal Game (all the
Summer-time) has his Residence in the rapid
and forcible Streams in Rivers; but the Sea
is his Sanctuary most Months in the Winter:
So that a Man may rationally conclude, with|out
a Parenthesis, that he is always to be found,
though not always in Season. Besides, the
Salmon is incident, as other Fish are, to various
Accidents; more especially if we consider the
female Fish, who in the Spring (as other Fe|males
do) drops her Eggs (but some call it
<HI>Spawn</HI>) which makes her infirm: and if it so
happen that she lags behind her natural Mate in
the fall of the Leaf, she is then prohibited the
<PB N="251" REF="147">
benefit of Salt-water to bathe her Fins, and car|ry
off her slimy Impurities, which is the natu|ral
Cause of her kipperish Infirmity, that alters
her delicate Proportion of Body, and blots out
the beautiful Vermilian Stain and sanguin Tin|cture
of Blood, which vividly and transparent|ly
shines through her rubified Gills; so that now
she begins to look languid and pale, her Fins
they fag, and her Scales by degrees lose their
natural shining Brightness; as also her regular
and well-compos'd Fabrick of Body, looks
thin, lean, and discoloured: and her Head that
grows big, and disproportionable, as if di|stemper'd
and invaded with the Rickets; over
whose Chaps hangs a callous Substance, not much
unlike to a Falcon's Beak; which plainly de|notes
her out of Season, and as plainly as any
thing demonstrates her Kippar.</P>
<P>Now I come to nominate some eminent Ri|vers
in <HI>England,</HI> that accommodate the Ang|ler
with the Race of Salmon. First therefore I
prefer the River <HI>Trent,</HI> because of her rapid
and Oriental Streams; that never sully them|selves,
till arriving near to the Shores of <HI>Gains|borough,</HI>
where <HI>Trent</HI> oft washeth her Banks
with the <HI>Eagre,</HI> so glides immediately into the
Arms of <HI>Humber.</HI> Next unto <HI>Trent,</HI> we pre|sent
you with the translucid glittering Streams
of <HI>Severn,</HI> that not far from <HI>Bristol</HI> mingle them|selves
with the Ocean. Nor shall we omit
those torpid and melancholy Streams of <HI>Owse,</HI>
that gulph themselves into <HI>Trent</HI>-fall. But of all
Rivers that glide through the cultivated Fields
in <HI>England,</HI> the bountiful, beautiful, and most
illustrious <HI>Thames</HI> has the Soveraignty of the
<PB N="252" REF="148">
rest; because her Streams influence not <HI>England</HI>
only, but all the Banks and Shores in <HI>Europe;</HI>
and is without Precedent, because of the excel|lency
and delicacy of her Fish, more especially
below Bridg; where the Merchants turn Ang|lers,
and throw their Lines as far as both
<HI>Indies, Peru,</HI> the <HI>Ganges, Mozembique, Barbary,
Smirna, Alexandria, Aleppo, Scandaroon,</HI> and all
the wealthy Ports in the Universe. These are
the Fish that feast the Nation; otherwise <HI>Eng|land</HI>
would be unlike it self, if unhappily want|ing
such provident Anglers.</P>
<P>But <HI>Scotland</HI> has already received a Character
of most of her eminent Rivers and Rivulets,
that wash and moisten her sandy Shores; nor
have I nominated more than four Metropolitan
Rivers in <HI>England,</HI> that bathe her fertil and flo|rid
Banks; because having a mind to step into
<HI>Wales,</HI> or the Suburbs of it, to discover there a
singular Curiosity, which probably may puzzle
the Opinion of Artists and others. Now one
of these Rivers in called <HI>Wye,</HI> but the other is
known by the name of <HI>Vsk:</HI> both which Rivers,
as I am told, incorporate themselves on the
Southside of <HI>Monmouth.</HI> But the reason why I
mention these two eminent Rivers, is only in
regard of their various entertainments, by rea|son
the Salmon there are always in Season; for
the one supplies the Defects of the other. As
thus for example; If when to consider <HI>Wye</HI>
flourisheth with Salmon, <HI>Vsk</HI> as if no River, is
rarely discours'd of. On the contrary; when
as <HI>Vsk</HI> sends her Supplies to the bordering In|habitants,
then is <HI>Wye</HI> as little as any thing
thought of. By this Contrariety and Diversity
<PB N="253" REF="148">
of Nature, the Natives may conclude that Win|ter
and Summer give not only the Season to
Salmon, but rather that they have Laws from
the Streams they glide in; or <HI>Wales</HI> differs from
all the World.</P>
<P>The next thing that falls under the Anglers
Consideration, is the Bait or Charm for the
Royal Race of Salmon; which I reduce under
the Classis of two generals, <HI>viz.</HI> the Fly for Fro|lick,
to flourish and sport on the surface of the
Streams; and the Ground-bait for Diversion,
when designing to drag at the bottom. But
what if I direct you a central way, that in my
Opinion upon approved Practice will intice him
ashore in Mid-water. Now if the Angler de|sign
that for his exercise, (in such case) let him
make provision of fair and large Minews, small
Gudgeons, or a diminutive Dace, (with the ar|tificial
use of the Swivel to flourish his Bait)
the Brightness or Gloominess of the Day con|sidered:
But if the Ground-bait be intended,
which always succeeds best in discoloured Wa|ters;
then in such case, prepare for him a well|scoured
Lob-worm, or knotted Dew-worm,
drag'd forth of the Forest, or any other sterril
or barren Soil, which as soon as any thing (with
dextrous management) will compel him ashore
though it cost him his Life. I write from Experi|ence,
for I am not unacquainted with the mul|tiform
variety of terrene Animals; as you may
read more at large in my following Appendix:
more especially of those Worms, that are taken
and drag'd forth out of a hard and skirrous
Earth, which ought to be well depurated (or
scoured) two or three days in the finest, clean|est,
<PB N="254" REF="149">
and sweetest Moss that fastens it self to the
root of the Ash-tree; sprinkling it first with
new and sweet Ale; afterwards remember to
squeeze it forth, so operate like an Artist: but
that which is better, and more concordant to
my approbation, is fleeted Cream, from the
benevolence of the Dairy; which to admiration
makes your Worm become viscous and tough;
and that which yet is more to be admired, they
also become bright, and almost transparent: for
that end I counsel and advise the Angler, when
designing to approach the Deeps for Diversi|on,
that he take some always with him to
heighten his Exercise, or influence and inamour
his Game. It is not so difficult to put some in
a Box made of Wood called <HI>Lignum Vitae,</HI> per|forated
with Holes, besmearing or anointing
it over first with the Chymical Oil of Bays,
Sulphur, <HI>Barbadoes</HI> Tar, Ivy, <HI>Cornu-Cervi;</HI> or
indeed almost any other Oil that has but a strong
and foetid Empyruma, will serve well enough,
where the Oil of Oesprey is generally wanting.</P>
<P>With these requisite Circumstantials we ap|proach
the Deeps, and the strongest Descents
and Falls in the stiffest Streams; the like we do
in Eddies, and turns in back-Waters; for the
Salmon you must know loves a solitary Shade.
Arm well be sure, and fish as fine as you can,
(<HI>Isaac Owldam</HI> used to fish with but three Hairs
at Hook) and forget not the Swivel, as above
precautioned; and the running Line be sure
you remember. Stand close I advise you, and
keep your distance, especially when approach|ing
the rapid Fords, because there, for the most
part, the Streams run clear, and you with de|sign
<PB N="255" REF="149">
come on purpose to destroy him; as it's
probable you may, provided your Art, Skill and
Ingenuity do but serve to manage so eminent an
Encounter. Now give me leave but to step
from the Water-side to numerate and describe
the various Brood of Salmon; so to distinguish
them according to Mode, or as some will have
it, the Custom of the Country. Where note,
in the South they call him <HI>Samlet;</HI> but if you
step to the West, he is better known there by
the name of <HI>Skeggar;</HI> when in the East they avow
him <HI>Penk;</HI> but to the Northward, <HI>Brood</HI> and
<HI>Locksper,</HI> so from thence to a <HI>Tecon;</HI> then to a
<HI>Salmon.</HI></P>
<P>Now to recreate with the Fly, (meaning the
Artificial) that's another sort of Exercise for
the Angler's Diversion; which ought to be con|sidered,
and diversly consulted, in regard of so
great variety of Form, Lustre, Beauty and Pro|portion.
For that end let me advise you, that
the ground of your Fly be for the most part
obscure, of a gloomy, dark and dusky Com|plexion;
fashioned with Tofts of Bears-Hair,
blackish or brownish discolour'd Wool, inter|woven
sometimes with Peacocks Feathers, at
otherwhiles lap'd about with Grey, Red, Yel|low,
Green, or Blewish Silk, simple Colours,
or Colours sometimes intermingled. For in|stance,
Black and Yellow represent the Wasp
or Hornet; and a promiscuous Brown the flesh
Fly; so of the rest. For that end consult the
Humour of the Fish, who to humour your Ex|ercise
puts himself out of Humour, chiefly and
principally when he parts with his Life. These
requisite Precautions ought to be the study of
<PB N="256" REF="150">
every studious and ingenious Angler, together
with the knowledg of Time and Season, when
to resort to the River for Recreation. The
next thing necessary is the shape of your Rod,
which ought in all respects to represent the Rush
in its growth; for that end we call it Rush|grown:
and be sure it be streight and plient.
Your Line also that must be accurate and exactly
taper'd; your Hook well compassed, well point|ed,
and well barbed: and be mindful that your
Shank exceed not in length; I mean not so long
as when you drag with the Ground-Bait. Nor
is it proper for the Artist to court a Stream, ex|cept
he be always provided of his dubbing Bag,
wherein are contained all sorts of Thrums,
Threads, Silks, Moccado-Ends, Silver and Gold
Twist; which are of excellent use to adorn your
Fly, and in a great measure quicken the sight
of your Game; provided the Day be promis|cuous
and dark, occasioned by smooty and dis|coloured
Clouds.</P>
<P>Now should I enumerate the multiform vari|ety
of Animals, the various Colours and Pro|portion
of Infects, with the diversity of Flies,
it would but redouble my Labour and Trou|ble;
since already I have discoursed them in a|nother
place; where the Artist also, if he be
ingenious, may consult and examine the Me|thods
of Experiments, so make himself Master
of this solitary Mystery: otherwise let him re|main
silent among Proficients, and a profest Ig|noramus
among Practitioners. And among the
variety of your Fly-adventurers, remember the
Hackle, or the Fly substitute, form'd without
Wings, and drest up with the Feather of a Ca|pon,
<PB N="257" REF="150">
Pheasant, Partridg, Moccaw, Phlimingo,
Paraketa, or the like, and the Body nothing
differing in shape from the Fly, save only in
ruffness, and indigency of Wings. Another ne|cessary
Observation, is the Wing of your Fly,
which ought to proceed from the Teal, Heron;
Malard, or Faulcon. The Pinion and Wing
thereof ought to lie close, and so snug as to carry
the Point exactly downward. But the last
thing material is, the moderate Stroak; which
always proves Mortal, and best succeeds if used
without Violence: the Line also, keep that
streight as occasion requires, so that nothing be
remiss, nor any thing wanting; and the necessity
of the Wheel be sure you remember.</P>
<L>The <HI>Salmon</HI> loves those rapid Rivers, where</L>
<L>The craggy Rocks above the Streams appear.</L>
<L>In deepest Waters, and in strongest Streams</L>
<L>He lives; yet like a Martyr sometimes dies in flames.</L>
</SP>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The TROVT.</HEAD>
<P>I have already told you that the Salmon is
King in the Freshes: And now I must tell you
that the Princely Trout has his residence and
principality in the same fluctuating Element,
partaking very much of the Nature of Salmon,
admiring stiff and rapid Streams in the Vernon
Ingress; but he accosts the solitary Deeps most
Months in the Winter. In the Spring, you
shall observe this active Animal scud to the
Fords, where he flutters his Fins at every silly
Fly; for that's his Rendezvouz, and there you'l
find him, picking and gliding against Stones in
the Bottom, to scour off, if possible, the slimy
<PB N="258" REF="151">
Substance and Scurf from his sickly Sides;
frequently occasioned through want of Motion.
So that when the Sun vegetates and invigorates
the Creation, then is he invigorated with Moti|on
and Activity, which argues a very great and
unpardonable Absurdity in the ignorant and
incredulous Angler, to fancy that Peregrinati|on
debilitates and weakens him; when appa|rently
it adds an additional Strength&punc; not well
considering they were only told so; or perad|venture
they had read it in some printed Book,
concluding from thence an <UNCLEAR>Infallibility</UNCLEAR> in the
Press.</P>
<P>But as I intend not to burden you with Cir|cumlocutions,
for brevity sake, I shall range
the Trout under the consideration of the first
Classis of Fish. For that end, I must signa|lize
his Vivacity and Vigour, his Activity and
Courage, how naturally they spring from the
Nature of this Fish, till Age or Accident indispose
and deprive him, not only of Activity,
but of natural Ability; who struggles with him|self
to out-do Motion, and out-live, if possible,
the Law of his Life. So that to prohibite him
Travel, you totally destroy him; since he is
a Fish that can't live under Confinement. And
thus it happens to the Race of Salmon, for Na|ture's
Laws are alike to both. In the Summer's
Solstice he accosts the Fords, making inspection
and inquisition after the variety of Emmits and
Insects, hovering his Fins in every murmuring
purling Stream in Rivers and Rivulets, which
not only puts a Spur to the Angler's Exercise,
but his Expectation also: and this, if any thing&punc;
is the Angler's <HI>Elizium;</HI> which I shall not insist
<PB N="259" REF="151">
upon here, because having inlarged upon it suf|ficiently
already. In this place I shall only treat
of the Ground-bait; which most commonly is
a knotted or budled Dew-worm; much of the
Nature and Kind of the former, but not usu|ally
so large as that we procure for the Salmon.</P>
<P>Now as every Angler concludes the Trout a
delicate Fish for Diversion, so others, as Artists,
consult him a delicious Entertainment. But the
Trout to entertain himself, as eagerly sucks in
a well-scour'd Red-worm, as the wide-mouth'd
<HI>Humber</HI> swallows up a full Spring-Tide. For
that end, grudg him not what he loves, and
give him time to digest it. Your Business is on|ly
to stand Sentinel, and to keep a vigilant Eye
and a diligent Hand over him; for Patience is
not only an Exercise but an Excellency in Ang|lers,
provided they fall not asleep at their Ex|ercise;
especially when Angling or Troling with
the Ground-bait, which upon probate proves
most profitable after gluts of Rain and disco|loured
Waters. Nor is this Ground-bait o|therwise
than a Worm, variously discours'd by
me at several Times, and in sundry Places. For
that end (to avoid repetitions) where the Worm
fails of Success, make trial of the Minew, in
Sharps or Scours, by dragging at the bottom, or
in mid-water; which if dextrously performed
(with the Swivel) by the Hand of an Artist,
he shall seldom or rarely fail of Success.</P>
<P>But for the Fly-fishing, if that be the Artist's
Intention; let me soberly advise him to soli|cite
moderate Winds, rather than intemperate
and violent Gusts. Rally my Reasons, and sum
them up; you will find them more copious in
<PB N="260" REF="152">
my former Conference, where at large I dis|course
and decipher both the Shape, Colour,
and the Proportion of Flies; for I hate Tauto|logies,
because hateful in themselves; and
there's nothing more troublesom to an ingeni|ous
Artist, than to be glutted by telling a Story
twice. The Trout therefore judicially consi|dered,
his Mouth is not by much so large as the
Salmon's; nor requires he so copious nor so
large a Hook, nor need his Tackle be so robust
and strong. But for the Rod and Line, take
care, that they in all respects be exactly tapered.
And to hit the Mark as near as may be, let care
be taken that the Line in every part be equally
stretch'd, and the Steel of your Hook of an
even Temper; nor matters it how light you are
arm'd at the Hook; so that on the Surface,
when you flourish your Fly, be sure that you
gain the Head of the Stream; and if possible,
the Wind, to facilitate your Cast. But if the
Ground-bait be your Exercise, then let the length
of your Line seldom or rarely exceed the Rule of
your Rod: whilst the Fly-Diversion grants a lar|ger
Charter, Distance and Dimension also come
under the consideration of every Artist that is
mindful to measure exact Proportion, by con|cealing
himself from the Streams he sports in.
So that if at any time the Fly fails of success, as
frequently it has happened to my self and others,
let the Angler then have recouse to the Ashtree-Grub,
the Palmer-worm, Caterpillar, green
or gray Drak, the depinged Grasshopper; or
that truculent Insect, the green Munket of the
Owlder-tree. But if none of these Baits pre|sented,
succeed to profit; and the Water as
<PB N="261" REF="152">
we apprehend to remain discoloured; let him
then assault the Trout at the Bottom, with that
mortal Allurement which I call the Gild-tale:
for that of all Worms allures him ashore.</P>
<L>The generous Trout to make the Angler Sport,</L>
<L>In deep and rapid Streams will oft resort.</L>
<L>Where if you flourish but a Fly, from thence</L>
<L>You hail a Captive, but of Fish the Prince.</L>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The PIKE.</HEAD>
<P>The Pike is a voracious ravenous Fish, that
frequents the Waters, and lives always upon
Spoil: for Moss-Trooper like, he murders all
he meets with. And as it is impossible to find
him without an Appetite, so is it as improbable
to proffer him any thing that he'l refuse. One
would think him a Graduate by his various Ap|pellations;
as that of Jack, Pickerel, Pike, and
Lucit; which makes him look big and swell
with Titles, as <HI>Westminster-hall</HI> look'd blough
with <HI>Dunbar</HI> Trophies. Now the Angler that
consults this formidable Desperado, must search
him in the Spring by examining the Ditches,
narrow Grips &amp; Gullies, where probably he may
find him poaching after Mice; and in the Avenues
in Marishes hunting after Frogs, with which he
trucks his Life for a Trifle. But the yellow
Frog, of all Frogs, brings him to Hand, for
that's his dainty and select Diet, wherein Na|ture
has placed such magical Charms, that all
his Powers can never resist them, if fastned on
the Hook with that exactness, that his Life may
shine, and the Bait seem undeprived of natural
Motion. Which if dextrously performed, the
<PB N="262" REF="153">
Angler will be convinced, that a Ledger of all
Baits is the most truculent destructive Morsel
in the World.</P>
<P>But <HI>March</HI> expiring, and <HI>April</HI> on the As|cendent,
his Eye-sight clears up, and his Appe|tite
too, for a brighter Bait; and then a small
Roach, or a Bream will down; so will a Bleak,
and a small young Dace, or for Variety the
Head of an Eel. But if a Junior Perch be
strip'd of his Fins, or a fresh plump Gudgeon
neatly link'd to the arming be but laid before
him, he shall never refuse it, when so greedy of
a Worm that he'l hazard his Life for it. But
then I prescribe it no approved Bait, rather a
fortunate Accident in my successful Adventures.
But his Winter-Quarters are the sullen Deeps,
where he burdens himself with Clouds of Wa|ter,
as aged People do that heap on Apparel;
when in the Spring he is all Gaity, and like the
Prodigal, scorns that his Life should out-live
his Patrimony. But the Summer approaching,
we then consider him more circumspect, more
cunning, more cautious, and under better
Guards; for then in a Deep you may search
him, and probably find him; but then you
must have it at the Tail of a Ford: when in
Autumn you shall find him lap himself in Can|docks,
at other times in <HI>Bullrushes; and where|ever
the Fry is, there is he, if not in the midst, yet
he's never far from them.</HI> I have known this
Fish deluded with a Trout; a Trout did, I say?
there's no Fish that swims in the Freshes is such
an alluring Temptation; nor can the Pike any
more resist this Charm, than he can resist his na|tural
Disposition after Diet. The consequence
<PB N="263" REF="153">
proves true upon the Angler's Examination; for
the Pike has strong Inclinations after any thing
that swims; who as seldom as any Fish wants
an Appetite, and by his good Will would al|ways
be eating.</P>
<P>After this manner we discourse the Pike;
who dwells almost every where, except in the
Ocean, or in brackish Waters; but in the Lough,
you shall find him there o're-grown, sometimes
to an amazing bigness; when in the River, and
translucid Streams in Rivulets, his Taste is from
thence transchanged to a more excellent Sweet|ness,
and upon proof will be found much more
nutricious. But his way of germinating is
the same with the Salmon, to answer the Ends
of Procreation, as for the most part all barrel'd
Fish do, who rises early in the Infancy of the
Year, and admires all Changes that the Season
presents.</P>
<L>The Pike or Lucit, is a Mercenary;</L>
<L>Or Anglers seem among themselves to vary.</L>
<L>He loves no Streams, but hugs the silent Deeps:</L>
<L>And eats all Hours, and yet no House he keeps.</L>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The CARP.</HEAD>
<P>The Carp is a Fish complicated of a moross
Mixture, and a torpid Motion, one that loves to
live in melancholy Calms, rather than to ram|ble
in the rapid Rivers and translucid Streams.
Ponds and Pools are generally his Palaces, where
he loves good Eating, but seldom or rarely
travels far to fetch it: who as seldom as any
Fish exceeds the compass of his Colony, nor
ever attains to that maturity of largeness, where
<PB N="264" REF="154">
there's rapid Rivers, and swift gliding Streams,
as he does in the Lake or solitary Lough. The
Antients were of Opinion, and so am I, that
Travel extenuates and lessens Growth; and
that in the Rivers and spacious Rivulets, every
Master Fish pleads a right of Possession;
whereby Acts of Hostility are hourly com|menced,
with the loss of Life to the weaker
sort; at least of his Habitation, when a stronger
than himself claims a right of Possession: for
when to consider the antipathy in Fish, as the
secret animosity that lurks under the Flesh, it's
no wonder that the great Ones eat up the lit|tle
Ones. And this our daily Experience, as a
Monitor, discovers unto us, the Antipathy and
Animosity Fish have in the Ocean; for Antipa|thy
will be Antipathy as certainly as Sympathy
is Sympathy, notwithstanding the Nature of
Climat, Constitution, or Element.</P>
<P>Since therefore we have signified the Resi|dence
of the Carp, it's but requisite to proceed
to tell you what he loves; and that is soon done,
if you cast but your Eye on the blooming Hau|thorn;
for then your Carp-angling begins to
commence, which terminates in <HI>August,</HI> as the
Vulgar would have it: but this Rule admits of
too many Exceptions; for all the Summer-sea|son,
more especially in a dropping and moist
Air, he bites without dispute, if he likes his
Commons, and you but cautious enough to con|ceal
your self, who as rarely as any Fish quar|rels
with the fineness or coarseness of your
Tackle; which deserves a serious Considerati|on,
in as much as Neatness and Fineness are
requisite and necessary accomplishments in any
<PB N="265" REF="154">
thing of Art, more especially that of Angling:
and the Bait to surprize him is less difficult than
any thing, because by every Angler so generally
understood; which will shorten my Discourse,
and invite me to a Conclusion. But before I
close, let me tell you what he loves; and that's
the Unctuosity of the purplish Dew-worm, pro|vided
you depurate him from all Impurities, to
remonstrate his Beauty and Lustre of Life. Ex|amine
him but with this Bait to free me from
Suspicion, and remove the Censure of clamo|rous
Anglers, that oft-times repine at their own
Undertakings; but that I cannot help, they
may use the Lob-worm if they please, which if
they rightly order, will (I'le assure them) turn
to good Account, more especially if perfumed
with the Oil of <HI>Annis.</HI></P>
<P>But my Observation leads me to another Cu|riosity,
and that is Paste. But of Pastes (let
me tell you) there are as many sorts among
Anglers, as there are Saints-days in the Pope's
Kalendar: but this hinders not but that Pastes
may be effectual, more especially when com|mix'd
and compounded with fine Bean-flower,
English-Honey, and poudred Sugar, amalga|mized
or mingled with the Yolk of an Egg;
and if the Fat of an Heron be supperadded to
it, it makes it not the worse; but the Marrow
of a Heron makes it much more the better. Be|sides,
sometimes he loves a taste of the Dairy-Maid;
as at other times he affects the smell of
the Shambles, because a great admirer of clot|ted
Blood; or almost any thing when he is in
Humour.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="155">
Now as Operation in Artifice is the <HI>Corona</HI> of
Art, so Demonstration in Science is the ultimate
End of Experience. I forfeit neither my Reason
nor Opinion in this Assertion: nor do I in my
Arguments undermine those Artists that pra|ctically
and experimentally understand the right
use of the Worm; though some with Honey
and other Dulcids have sweetly allured him, and
some others with Tar (supposing him a Tar|polin)
have summoned him ashore; yet I de|clare
upon practice, that if the Worm do not
pleasure him, the Angler may mingle Despairs
with his Sports. But then let him consider the
Complement of Licorish, or the homogeniety of
the Oil of Annis, Cummin, or <HI>Assafetida</HI> to
furnish it with a Hogoe, which in my Opinion
surpasseth the camerial Oil of Oespres: yet not
that I altogether doubt the truth of so famous
a Secret, celebrated by the Antients, but rather
the rarity of so admirable a Discovery; such
another some fancy is that of the Phenix.</P>
<L>The Carp's no Courtier, nor a Country Guest;</L>
<L>Yet answers both, all after as he's drest.</L>
<L>He loves the silent Deeps, in Ponds and Pools;</L>
<L>A Dish for States-men, or a Mess for Fools.</L>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The PERCH.</HEAD>
<P>The Perch is a well-disciplined martial Fish,
of much more Mettle, Gallantry and Courage
than the Carp; though not almost, but altoge|ther
of as slow a Motion; and though as free
from the taint of Controversy, as the Wax is
free to submit to the Impression of the Seal, yet
he never enters the List but he always arms
<PB N="267" REF="155">
himself. It's true, he's a Volunteer that lives
above fear; nor dreads he that any thing of
Art can invade him: nay though he see himself
surrounded with Danger and Difficulties, and
immured with Rocks and ruinous Decays; yet
he will shew himself as prodigal of his Stock of
Life, as any Fish living that floats in Water.
It is true, I must confess, that he is a great ad|mirer
of smooth Rivers, but the rapid Streams
in Rivulets he seldom or never frequents, not|withstanding
him so bold and daring a Fish;
Nor is he of any great Activity in the solitary
Lough; and would to his liking use as little Ex|ercise
in the River, did not the Streams some|times
invade him, which makes him more active
than otherwise he would be, because of Self-preservation.
Which still strengthens my Opi|nion
of preferring the River-Fish in excellency
to exceed those in the Pond: though peradven|ture
Travel mitigates Growth, (as we former|ly
discours'd) yet it most generously compen|sates
the Gusto; for every Fish that comes cau|tiously
by his Commons, is by so much the more
confirm'd delicious, and if I mistake not as nu|tricious
also.</P>
<P>Now would not any Man think those Con|ceptions
very sordid, to prefer the Goose to
the Gossander; and vie the Hog with the Hind?
It's true, some hug and imbrace the Vision of
remote Novelties, because to fancy that Distance
and Difficulty make things rare; so it may
well enough, for it makes them dear. And
what would it signify to a rural Palat, was that
Palat by foreign Curiosities daily impos'd up|on?
Besides, it's Treason in the abstract, against
<PB N="268" REF="156">
the Law of Bounty, for any Man to imagine
Partiality in Nature, since every thing is desti|nated
by an immutable Decree, to answer the
primary Ends ordained. The great Work-master
needs no contribution from the Mine to
enable him to infuse Virtue into the Creation;
nor needs he to borrow any thing from the
Creature, since the Creature is only the margi|nal
Note of the Universe; the Creation it self
being the stupendous Volume. But as every
thing naturally adheres to its own Like, and
Semblances partake of their own Properties,
Stars then were not made meerly to gaze at, nor
Elements but as Vortrices for corporeal Recep|tion;
otherwise how could Birds divide their
ambient Air, or Fish force a Passage through
the fluctuating Ocean, where sometimes the
treacherous Net betrays them? yet so resolv'd
are they with contempt to Cruelty, that they
scorn to petition a Reprieve for Life, but rather
submit themselves to be tortur'd to Death, by
the tormenting Hand of the scarifying Cook,
that dispenseth with Art to elevate the Appetite,
if when only to make it pleasant to a generous
Acceptation.</P>
<P>But to look for the Perch, you need not go
far to seek him that is to be found almost any
where, if you please but to step to the Suburbs
of the Streams of <HI>Trent,</HI> or the solitary Deeps
near the rapid Streams in most Rivers and Rivu|lets
in the Circle of <HI>England;</HI> if examined at
the Bottom, for you may search and find him
under hollow Banks, Eddies, Pools, Miln-Pits,
Turns of Streams, at the Tales of Sluces,
Flood-gates, and back-Waters, near to the
<PB N="269" REF="156">
Stumps of Trees, Wier-heads, Stanks, Can|docks
and Bull-rushes; but if there be any ru|inous
Decays, there you will certainly find him
that is to be found: Indeed one would think
him a piece of an Antiquary, because he loves
to be rifling among Ruins. Now presupposing
you have found him, what is next to be done?
that ought to be considered, in regard it's the
Angler's Care and Study to accommodate him
like an Artist, with what he loves. But you
will ask me what that is? And I readily answer,
and tell you, not with coarse Tackle, nor a
slovenly Bait: for though the Carp is not
squeemish, nor the Perch shame-faced, yet he
hates Rudeness, coarse Tackle, and slovenly
Commons; greatly admiring Dew-worms if
well depurated, Cankers, Caterpillars, Cod-worms,
Grubs, Brandlins, Minews, and the ju|nior
Fry of small Fish; these Novelties affect
him to a change of Element, who lays down his
Life for what he loves. But the Charm of all
Baits that invites him ashore (as Fancy is seldom
unfurnished with Invention) is that truculent
Mortal the Gild-tail; which sooner than any
thing sends him a Summons of Death; for
which at any time he shall give you his Life, and
that is as much as the World has to part with,
nor hath he any more than himself to give.</P>
<L>Now let the Angler that would fish for Perch,</L>
<L>The Turns in Rivers, and back-Waters search.</L>
<L>In deepest Lakes the largest Perch you'l find:</L>
<L>And where the Perch, is Kind will answer Kind.</L>

<HEAD>BREAM.</HEAD>
<P>The Bream, though we grant him a flegma|tick
Fish, and a Fish as naturally as any Fish ad|dicted
to Ease and Idleness, yet he enjoys him|self
as much in limpid Streams as other Fish do
that seek Sanctuary in solitary Lakes. And as
he hates rambling far from Home, so he abhors
Correspondency with those that do; content|ing
himself with torpid Streams, and hugs his
Fancy in solitary Deeps. <HI>Trent</HI> I have observed
for the Race of Bream, may challenge all <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
nay all <HI>Europe</HI> for ought I know, more
especially near those Streams that wet the Ports
of <HI>Gainsborough;</HI> where sometimes he washeth
his Fins with the <HI>Eagre,</HI> and arrives there to
that amazing bigness, that I blush to report it,
lest the Reader should suspect me. Indeed the
Bream is an excellent Companion, if you can
but get him into humour to bite; which may
easily be done, if you do but treat him with the
compost of Paste; for that will insinuate him
into the Pie, where his Bones will absorp, and
his Flesh amalgamize with fresh sweet Butter;
which being dissolved, will entertain you with a
nutricious Liquor, that for phlegmatick Hu|mours
is both Physick and Diet.</P>
<P>I never knew any Angler (except it was one)
that singly devoted himself a whole day's Diver|sion,
in order to court and entertain this Fish;
nor do I remember him inroll'd in the Angler's
Catalogue, among the first Classis of dignified
Fish. For that end therefore, as I intend bre|vity
in his Description, so give me leave to shew
you the readiest way how to surprize and take
him. But then you must consider him no con|stant
<PB N="271" REF="157">
Companion for all Constitution of Rivers
and Rivulets, though our Southern Streams
frequently enjoy him, except otherwise they
prove too rapid and forcible; for if so, then
he takes up his Residence in calmer Streams,
that enamour him with Bull-rushes, at other
whiles with Candocks: whose Recreation is lit|tle
more than the limits of his Confinement;
from whence he seldom extravagants himself,
until compell'd from thence by the Mediums of
Art, as at other times by Inundation, or De|luges
of Water, that send him sometimes a
Goal-Delivery.</P>
<P>But the variety of Baits to allure this Fish be|ing
so numerous and various, I shall confine my
self only to a few; which upon examination
will be found effectual. Compound therefore a
Paste as formerly described, of Honey, inter|mingled
with a little Brandy, Bean-flower, and
the Yolk of an Egg; which you may, if you
please, tinge with Gambogium, Vermilion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
This Bait sometimes, as soon as any thing, en|tices
him ashore. But in regard he is a Fish in|constant
as to Diet, some therefore feed him
with Gentles, and not without good Success&punc;
some others with Grubs, and othersome with
Caterpillars; but better is that of Cod-worms:
and sometimes any thing will do, if he be in Hu|mour.
But then you are to consider he loves
early rising, and is ready for Breakfast by break
of Day: so that if his Commons affect him, and
you so fortunately happy to meet with a cloudy
gloomy Morning, you may engage him for
ought I know, to keep you Company till the
solitudes of Night; which a well-scoured red
<PB N="272" REF="158">
Worm will sometimes do, and so will Cheese, for
he loves the Dairy: but all the World cannot
make him Fly-proof; yet a Brandlin makes his
Teeth water. But the Gild-tail, as above, is
such an invincible Charm, that all his Powers
cannot withstand it; but he will come ashore in
despight of Death.</P>
<L>Now if the Angler fish in <HI>Thames</HI> for Bream,</L>
<L>Or famous <HI>Trent;</HI> ne're let him search a Stream:</L>
<L>Deeps most allure him, so do Eddies too;</L>
<L>For near to Banks and Stanks he lies purdue.</L>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>TENCH.</HEAD>
<P>The Tench of all the Families of Fish is
both Physick and Physician; of a balsamick, nu|tricious
and medicinal Nature, that fortunately
Cures when others Kill; and distributes more
Good than Hurt in his Colony. It's true, he is
Sought for by every Angler, though obtained by
few; and the diseased Fish that finds him, finds
a Cure, and that's a reward answerable to Di|ligence.
Now as every Stream courts this phy|sical
Fish, yet but few Rivers in the Nation en|joy
him, who for the most part inhabits the
Pool; yet are not the Rivers denied him for a
publick Good. I cannot deny that he loves deep
Waters, more especially those that are of a tor|pid
and slow Motion; such upon examination
he greatly admires: nor shall any Man over|rule
him, nor at any time perswade him to be
out of conceit with Flags and Bull-rushes. I
have already told you that he is Medicine and
Physician; and now let me tell you he's a delici|ous
Morsel.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="158">
That Angler that knows any thing of Ang|ling,
must of necessity know that the Tench of
all Fish is no Fish of Prey, and one that lives
upon as little Food as any Fish that wags a Fin;
but then he must have it choice and delicate,
wholsom and juicy; and truly he well deserves
it, since so little serves his turn. Search well
therefore in the solitary Deeps, and there as soon
as in any Place you'l find him, as if by Nature
destinated to a cynical Life, which the Igno|rant
impute to a want of Exercise; not well
considering it's no part of his Business to ramble
in the Rivers, to expose himself to Ruin: which
makes me fancy that but a few junior Piscatori|ans
have thorowly consulted this <HI>Aesculapian,</HI>
who beyond dispute is of a Balsamick Nature;
whose slimy Sides administer Relief, if when
but to glance upon his fellow-Creature. So that
I think it worthy my Management and Under|taking
to draw forth some Directions how the
Angler may surprize him with our innocent
Artillery of Hook and Line; which will be
enough, as I conceive, to convince him, if in
Season he please but to make a trial.</P>
<P>In the South of <HI>England,</HI> where the Fields
are fertil (so in the North, though more un|cultivated)
this piece of Curiosity is frequently
discours'd among Anglers, meaning such as out
of a Fancy, or foreign Curiosity, have under|taken
to feed him with Tar and Rye-bread,
supposing him a Tarpollin; and not without
success, whilst some others have diverted him
with various Pasts, using 'em as an Argument to
make him Pie-proof. Then again some have
fed him with English Honey, the Yolks of Eggs,
<PB N="274" REF="159">
and the Oil of Annis, commassated and mingled
with fine Bean-flower; this Bait is better ap|proved
of than rudely to choak him with toasted
Cheese. I own I must confess there be many
ways to feed him, though to my certain know|ledg
(except in the Pond) there are but few
places to find him in. He therefore that soli|cites
a sight of this Physical Fish, and impatient|ly
longs to hear him rumble in the Panier, let
him follow my Advice, with well-scoured Dew-worms,
kept very sweet in cleanly Moss; and if
that prove ineffectual to answer his Design, then
let him provoke him with the Flag or Dock-worm,
which will certainly answer the Angler's
Intention; otherwise let him blame both me and
my Directions.</P>
<L>The Tench best loves those torpid Waters, where</L>
<L>The Deeps are shaded well with Reeds; and there</L>
<L>The wounded Fish that could not long endure</L>
<L>The Smart and Pain, finds him, so finds a Cure.</L>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>BARBLE.</HEAD>
<P>The Barble, though experienced a resolute
Fish, yet is he as shame-faced as any of his Fel|lows:
And as he hates to quarrel, so he abhors
an Affront; but reserves his Strength, Activity
and Agility, till the Rod or the Net prove his
Examinant; whose Belly or Spawn may be eaten
as Diet, but then it proves in operation but
churlish Physick; not that I assert it my Opini|on
only, let Experience upon Examination bet|ter
instruct you. Now when the Angler comes
to the Water-side, and brings what he loves,
he courts a Familiarity, though his Credit of
<PB N="275" REF="159">
late has been much impair'd in the Cook-room:
which possibly may proceed from the ignorant
Order of such as study rather to gratify their
voracious Appetites, than the curious Methods of
the Art of Angling. However, <HI>Isaac Walton</HI>
has provided a Cook, that in his Opinion can
dress him well enough, whose Arguments be|yond
dispute, had indubitably miscarried, had
not his Wife had a Finger in the Pie. Thus he,
and some others, dress Fish before they catch
them; but I approve it requisite to catch them
first, and then at your leisure dress them after|wards.</P>
<P>The Barble, so named from his Barbs or
Wattles, most passionately admires the depth
of the River, at the tale of a Stream: where
you shall usually find him sucking of Soil, and
lying purdue for Worms and Insects, or any
thing else that is sweet and edible. And by how
much the stronger you observe the Stream, by
so much the more strength has the Fish that in|habits
therein. And if there be Rubbish, or
any sort of Lumber, for his part he likes it ne|ver
the worse; and if ruinous Decays, or great
Stones in the Bottom, so much the better for his
Security, whose Provision is rarely any thing
else, save only what Nature daily provides him.
Nor is he numbred among the Fish of Prey;
nor is he a Glutton, yet he knows how to eat;
nor is he over-curious to court for Varieties,
though some feed him with Paste, and their
Liberality he retaliates; and some proffer him
Cheese to close up the Orifice of his Stomach,
them he also gratifies: and some give him
Worms well depurated and scoured, for which
<PB N="276" REF="160">
Modicum he contributes his thanks: but he that
would feed him to death with a Dainty, must
bring him a dish of Salmon spawn.</P>
<L>The Barble courts the rapid Torrents more</L>
<L>Than solid Deeps: strong Streams remote from shore</L>
<L>Oblige him most; because the strongest Streams</L>
<L>Bring him supplies, the Rod brings only flames.</L>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>CHEVEN.</HEAD>
<P>The Chub or Cheven is a Fish of a supine Na|ture,
yet of a robust and rural Disposition, had
he but a Heart to manage his Strength; who
upon examination is by every one understood
better for Diversion by half than Diet: a coarse
feeder, and himself as coarse to be fed on; yet
of such a voracious Appetite, that he scorns to
see any thing that he cannot eat, if another Fish
can; but my Modesty constrains me to forbear
mentioning it. Now the Spring approaching,
every thing inamours him, for then he haunts
the Fords for fashion. 'Tis true he's an early
riser, that will sport the Angler at break of Day,
provided he furnish him with Codworms, Can|kers,
Caterpillars, Cow-dung-Grubs, Gentles,
Pastes tinctured with <HI>Cambogium, &amp;c.</HI> But
then you must cautiously obscure your self, and
appear like an Angler least in sight. Yet still
there's another way much better to surprize him,
that is by dibling on the surface of the Water,
if circumspectly you conceal your self behind a
Bush, or the more private and solitary shade of
Trees. But your Engine for this encounter, is
a Natural Fly, either the Flesh Fly, the Bank
Fly, the Gray or the Green Drake; but the
<PB N="277" REF="160">
Green Munkit of the Owlder-Tree excels all
the rest, as the Sun in Excellency outlustres
the Stars. Moreover you shall find him ga|ping
after Grass-hoppers, or any other Insect
that presents in season. And since nothing
comes amiss, so nothing distastes him; and
where the Locust is, there is he; which if well
examined to the Center of the Calms, he shall
recompense the Examinant with the reward of
his life; always provided he but separate the
Body from the Leatherish Wing, which by rea|son
of its Viscuosity is rarely digested; nor is
it otherwise by him well accepted.</P>
<P>'Tis true, with green Cheese some Anglers do
treat him, but then it succeds best at the tale
of a Stream; at the fall of Fords, into the
solitary Deeps. And that you may know he
affects variety, let the Artist at discretion ex|change
the Dairy Maid's Commons, for the
beauty of a bright and well-scoured Red-worm,
or the head of a Frog, in <HI>April</HI> or <HI>May,</HI> or
a black Snail sometimes in a dewy Morning.
These invitations make his Teeth stand a water.
But for Salmon-Spawn if you bring him that
Novel, you do your Business, and his too; and
shall have no cause I'll assure you to repent it,
when upon so fair an exchange, he trucks a|way
his Life for a trifle. But <HI>September</HI> approach|ing,
you must bring him Beef Pith, for which
he shall sacrifice all he has, and give you his
Carcase in exchange for his Commons. What's
more to be desired by the rule of Discretion, ex|cept
the Angler be so indiscreet as not to ac|commodate
him?</P>

<HEAD>GRAILING.</HEAD>
<P>Umbar or Grailing is an amorous Fish, that
loves a frolick as he loves his Life, whose Teeth
water after every Wasp, as his Fins flutter
after every Fly; for if it be but a Fly, or the
Product of an Insect, out of a generous Cu|riosity
he is ready to entertain it. Smooth and
swift Streams more than any thing enamour
him, notwithstanding he declines the force of
a Torrent: Nor shall you perswade him to
quarrel with the gliding Streams, provided they
be sweet, clear and shining. It is from these
translucid Streams that the Hackle, and the
artificial Fly court him ashore. But of all na|tural
<UNCLEAR>Insects</UNCLEAR> that accommodate the Art, the
green Drake is that sovereign Ophthalmick that
opens his Eyes, and shuts them again, with the
hazard of his Life, and loss of his Element.
Yet for this Fly-admirer, there is another Bait,
and that is the Munket, or a Seagreen-Grub, ge|nerated,
as I take it, amongst Owlder-Trees.
The like Product issues from the Willow, so
does it from the Sallow; nor is the Primp-fence
denied this vegetable Animal, save only they
are different in Splendour and Colour, as also
as different in Shape and Proportion. Take
then this Insect from the Owlder-Tree, to re|fute
the Hypothesis of the incredulous Angler;
which if ingeniously cultivated by the Art of
<PB N="279" REF="161">
Angling, will upon proof of a well-manag'd
Examination, invite Umbar or Grailing from
the top, or mid-water, to kiss your Hand, or
I'll break my Rod and disclaim the Art.</P>
<P>Well then, as we consider the Umbar not
over-curious of Deeps, we must consider him
also not over-cautious of Shallows, contenting
himself with a middle Fate, that directs him to
the smoothest and stiffest Streams, dedicating
and devoting himself to Motion, because a
great admirer of Peregrination; and though
not so generally understood as the Trout is,
yet give me leave to tell you, if you fish him
finely, he will keep you company, either in
<HI>Darwin,</HI> so in <HI>Dove,</HI> or in the glittering silver
Streams of <HI>Trent:</HI> Pray therefore when you fish
him, fish him finely, for he loves Curiosity, neat
and slender Tackle; and, Lady-like, you must
touch him gently, for to speak plain English,
he is tender about the Chaps, otherwise per|chance
you defeat your self, so lose your De|sign.
A Brandlin, if any thing, will intice
him from the Bottom; but the Gild-tail, of all
Worms, upon change of Water, will invite
him ashore, tho it cost him his Life.</P>
<L>Vmbar or Grailing in the Streams he'll lie,</L>
<L>Hov'ring his Fins at every silly Fly.</L>
<L>Fond of a Feather; you shall see him rise</L>

<HEAD>BVRBOLT.</HEAD>
<P>The Burbolt is a Fish so rarely discours'd, and
of so little conversation with other Fish, that
it's as difficult to find him, as it is to describe
<PB N="280" REF="162">
him, who differs in Nature from most other
Fish; so that if the Angler be not very inge|nious,
well educated and disciplined in the
Rudiments of Angling, he undertakes a Task
he can hardly perform, either to describe his
Nature or his Haunt. I know there are some
Rodomontadoes of the Rod, that wilfully and
extravagantly will arraign their Faith, and
rest it upon the mouldy Records and frothy
Opinion of slippery Authority, whereby to
confirm themselves in the vanity of Tradition,
as also to gratify the Zeal of Putationers. For
that end I must tell you, and you may tell o|thers,
that the silver Streams of triumphant
<HI>Trent,</HI> as frequently as any Streams, stroke the
scaly Fins of this famous Fish, who loves to
live by them, but cares not to live in them,
rather absconding himself in Eddies, and some|times
in Arches, not far from Streams and
Torrents of Water, where he is frequently
found by the industrious Angler: for to search
him striving against a Stream, is like to Q <HI>Eliza|beth</HI>'s
<HI>Scogen,</HI> that at the Sun's Meridian (with
a Candle and Lanthorn) sought up and down
for an honest Man: So to rifle the Streams in
<HI>Trent,</HI> or any other River for this <HI>incognito,</HI> is
but labour in vain, to seek for him that hides
himself from the rest of his Associates in soli|tary
Recesses; a lively imitation of <HI>Diogenes</HI> in
<HI>Dolio.</HI></P>
<P>The Burbolt therefore we are to consider
him a Fish, that as rarely as any Fish travels
far from Home to fetch his Food; from whence
we conclude him not over-cautious, whatever
it costs him, that values not his Life to pur|chase
<PB N="281" REF="162">
what he loves. And Fashion he affects
not, nor the Formality of Novels; who con|tents
himself with Country-Commons, rather
than to ramble up and down for Varieties; yet
would have it constant, though not over-costly:
who betters every thing by his own Delicacy,
because himself is a delicate Morsel; but sel|dom
tasted, and as rarely consulted. Which
makes every Angler desirous of him, since he
that takes him gets a Reward; which a well|scoured
Red-worm certainly accomplishes, as
soon as any thing except the Gudgeon, for
that's a Charm that compels him ashore.</P>
<L>To write the Burbolt's Epitaph; he dreams</L>

<HEAD>FLOVNDER.</HEAD>
<P>The Flounder is a Fish that bites before any
Man's Face, not dreading the Aspect of an In|vader.
It's true, he's a Fish that's as bold as a
Buccaneer; of much more Confidence than
Caution, yet nothing more curious; one that
loves good Meat, and is good Meat himself;
whose Appetite is open as early as his Eyes,
and contemplates Day before Sun-rise, fre|quently
busying himself about Break-fast, half
an Hour sometimes before break of Day; and
delights, I must tell you, to dwell among
Stones, so does he among Stakes and gravelly
Bottoms: besides he's a great admirer of
Deeps and ruinous Decays, yet as fond as any
Fish of moderate Streams, and none beyond
<PB N="282" REF="163">
him except the Perch, that is more solicitous
to rifle into Ruins; insomuch that a Man would
fancy him an Antiquary, when to consider him
so affected with Reliques, yet of that un|daunted
Courage, that he dares to feed before
any Man's Face, provided there be but Water
enough to cover him, though not to conceal
him. Moreover, he adheres so close to the
Bottom, that a Man would think him inocu|lated
to it, or at least an Inmate in another Ele|ment.</P>
<P>For that end let us consider the Flounder a
resolute Fish, and one that struggles stoutly for
a Victory with the Angler, and is more than
ordinarily difficult to deal with, by reason of
his Built, which is altogether flat as it were a
Level; so that if it happen your Tackle be
fine, and the Bottom, as it sometimes falls out,
to be foul, you run the risk of your Adventure
and Artillery. Now some Folks, beyond mea|sure,
admire this Fish, because opinionated he
is so nutricious: And truly he's good Food,
which makes him so desirable, though seldom
or rarely not over-cautious to come by, if the
Angler be industrious but to bring him a Bait
that he likes, and that is but reasonable. Pre|sent
him with a Lob-worm, he'll retaliate your
Courtesy; or in exchange, a depurated Dew|worm,
he'll not be ungrateful, for he loves va|riety
of all sorts of Worms, the Tag or Ta|gil,
besides Bradlins and Gild-tails, which
will at any time intice him to die for what he
loves; for you must know he's a Fish so fond
of a Worm, that he'll go to the Banquet tho
he die at the Board.</P>
<L><PB N="283" REF="163">
He that intends the Flounder to surprize,</L>
<L>Must rise betimes, and fish before Sun-rise.</L>

<L>Let him nod on, perhaps at Noon he'll parly.</L>

<HEAD>EEL or CONGER.</HEAD>
<P>The Eel insinuates himself into all sorts of
Waters, and can live in a Stream, or without
it; in the deepest Pit, or the shallowest Rivu|let;
in dirty muddy Ditches, and silty owsy
Bottoms; or in rocky Cavities in any Rivers,
wetting his Fins sometimes with the Ocean.
Now some are conceited that Eels are Insects,
and content not themselves with the Law of
Germination: And if so, then it seems that
Nature was more unactive about the Race of
Eels, than other Animals committed to her
Conduct; because to protrude and thrust them
forth as Inanimates, after the manner of Vege|tation.
Such are the ignorant Conceptions of
<HI>Gesner,</HI> and the unthinking Rabble of his ridi|culous
Proselytes; who, because to suck in such
pernicious Principles, have tainted, nay poi|soned
themselves by infecting others: For had
they but considered that Eels have Eggs, (tho
not so long as other Fish to bear them about
them) without dispute it would expose some
of them to a Blush, if when to reflect on their
erroneous Rashness, that causeth the Artist to
laugh at their Ignorance. But that Eels do
germinate, is past dispute; for if the Roe, or
Spawn, be the Product of Germination, then
Eels, as other Animals, may germinate <HI>in specie,</HI>
because furnished with all the Qualities for
<PB N="284" REF="164">
Germination; as is observed by the female Fish,
whose burdened Belly in the Spring (if exa|mined)
will sufficiently convince the Incredu|lity
of such as would by Advice be better in|formed,
whilst permitting others to content
themselves with the vanity of Ignorance, that
Eels are Insects.</P>
<P>The Eel therefore, you shall find him in Ca|verns,
and the Cavities sometimes of hollow
Rocks, Grips and Gullies, devised on purpose
by Engineers for the draining of Grounds:
Or else you may observe him in Holes or
hollow Banks, the Flaws in Bridges and bro|ken
Breaches, occasioned sometimes by Inun|dations
of Water; out of which Abscond|ments
any Man may angle him, that <UNCLEAR>contrives</UNCLEAR>
but a Worm neatly on the end of a Wand;
which Artifice is Probing, and some call it
<HI>Proking;</HI> but we dispute not the Term. Now
a more expeditious Invention, though not half
so genteel, is that Engine or Artifice some call
a <HI>Gleave,</HI> but some others the <HI>Eel-spear.</HI> Then
there's Bobbing with a bunch or cluster of
Worms, strung upon Threads, non-commissio|nated
by Anglers: Yet Night-hooks were ne|ver
prohibited, nor need they, since the Eel
bites in the heat of the Day. You must there|fore
consider him a Fish of an odd Humour,
that the sight of a Worm shall tempt him a|shore,
though he sacrifice his Life to the Lust of
his Adversary.</P>
<L>The Eel and Conger lies in sandy Bays,</L>
<L>On gravel Beds, and sometimes in Decays.</L>
<L><PB N="285" REF="164">

<L>You'll find this Fish as soon as any where.</L>

<HEAD>LAMPRE.</HEAD>
<P>The Lampre (or Suck-stone) frequently ac|costs
the Streams in <HI>Severn,</HI> and is conversant
also with many other Rivers in the Kingdom of
<HI>England.</HI> A Fish that makes more sport in the
Pie than the Pool; but of no great acquain|tance
nor familiarity with Anglers; and that is
the reason he is so little discours'd, as if there
were no such thing in being: But assure your
self there is, and the plenty of such in the Ri|ver
<HI>Cam,</HI> and some other Rivers, as <HI>Thames</HI> and
<HI>Trent;</HI> that I dare to assert and divulge them
numerous: But as torpid Deeps do not always
delight him, so transparent Streams do not al|together
transport him; nor admires he the
Torrents of rapid Rivers: And because no con|stant
Housekeeper, we have considered him as
unconstant to Diet. It's true, I have no Com|mission
to assign him a Traveller, and yet he is
seldom or rarely at Home. At Home did I say?
surely I mistook my self, because he has no Home
to go to, who lives like an Intruder, insinuating
himself into all sorts of Company, and puts a
Foot under every ones Table: for we find him
a Fish altogether in suspicion; therefore seldom
admitted among the scaly Society; who prefers
Sand and Gravel-beds infinitely before muddy
Recrements; and loves to be casting and suck|ing
Stones, because it's a great part of his Life
and Maintenance; except otherwhiles he stum|bles
upon Offil or Garbage, which if he do, he
feasts himself like a Country-Farmer; when at
<PB N="286" REF="165">
other times, like a shotten Herring, he is forced
to take up with shorter Commons; and such
are the roots of Segs and Candocks, which as|sign
him a sutable Sauce to his Diet.</P>
<P>I never yet knew an Angler with the Rod,
that designed a Day's Diversion with this piece
of Suspicion. It is true, I have heard him va|riously
discoursed, and perhaps as often as other
Men, have seen him make Circles in his own
Element, but irregular ones out on't; for I have
been at his Death sometimes with an Instru|ment,
and sometimes without it; but never at
his Destruction with the Rod and Line. The
next enquiry will be, how we shall surprize this
<HI>Argos,</HI> and reduce him, in some measure, to the
Angler's Designs. In order to that, some court
him with Loaches, some with Minews, some
with Dew-worms, a small Gudgeon, or toasted
Cheese: but the Maw of a Beast best pleaseth
him of any thing; and truly I fancy it the most
natural Bait for such a kind of a nasty Fish, that
nothing can surprize but the noosed Net; ex|cept
he happens to meet with the berbed Speer.</P>
<L>The Lampre loves a gravely Bottom best,</L>
<L>And's fam'd for Pie-meat more than all the rest.</L>
<L>I needs must say the Angler takes a Prize</L>
<L>That takes this <HI>Argos;</HI> or this Fish All-eyes.</L>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>ROACH.</HEAD>
<P>As the Roach is no costly Fish, so is he not
over-curiously enquired after. He that seeks
him, without difficulty finds him as early for
breakfast, as the Sun salutes the Creation; whose
habitation is found bordering upon Banks, in
<PB N="287" REF="165">
Eddies, small Turns, and meandring Streams;
and where there's a Bush in the Suburbs of the
Streams, there you shall find him sheltring him|self;
when recruits of Rain force down the
Freshes, and drive the Soil from off the fertil
Fields; for then you may fish him, and not go
far to find him: when at other times, more
especially near the approaching Winter, he
houses himself in the more solitary security of
Candocks and Bull-rushes, in Depths of the
Water. but whilst we paraphrase and discourse
the Roach, we but decipher and interpret the
Rud; since Nature's Laws are alike to both, for
both have but one Fate and Period, though of
different complexion in Fin, having natural In|clination
to long and warm Days, to small and
trilling Streams, yet neither of them lovers nor
admirers of Travel: by which you may guess,
that seldom or rarely they are found far from
Home; for placing a Content in their little
Confinements, shews their unwillingness to ex|amine
the extent of their Confines.</P>
<P>Now you are to consider the Roach a great
Fly-admirer, who examines the Season by the
Sun's distribution of Heat, that generously
warms and nourisheth the Creation, by giving
a new Life after the Death of an expiring Win|ter.
And since we observe him so inamoured
with Flies, care must be taken to bring him
what he loves; and that is the Ant, when In|sects
come in, for which servile Gratitude he re|compenseth
the Angler. Or if in the mean
time he be accommodated with Bank-flies, small
Flesh-flies, or a well-scoured Gentle, he doubly re|taliates,
when he gives you himself. I have given
<PB N="288" REF="166">
him Brandlins, Bee-grubs, Cow-Grubs, Cabbage-Grubs,
Cankers, Caterpillars, Pastes of all
Compounds, and of various Tinctures; for
which he never was ungrateful: but he that
brings him the yellow Cod-worm, brings him
what he loves, for his Patrimony can never pur|chase
the Prize, but submits to the Charm, and
proffers himself to the Angler.</P>
<L>The Roach (or Rud) not greedy of promotion,</L>
<L>Loves Ponds and Rivers, better than the Ocean.</L>
<L>In solitary Pools they spend their Time;</L>
<L>And Travel hate as an immortal Crime.</L>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>DACE.</HEAD>
<P>The Dace or Dare is the Fresh-water Her|ring;
a Fish that is common and constant; one
that loves to divert himself, and is the Angler's
Diversion: for it's rare to come to the Waterside,
and find him out of Humour to bite. Now
to tell you where he lives, I need not; for you
shall find him in most or all the Rivers and Ri|vulets
in <HI>England;</HI> and to acquaint you with
what he loves, is needless, for there's nothing
that is edible he'l at any time refuse. Hot
Weather allures him forth of Deeps; for warm
Days invite him abroad for Recreation, be|cause
then he bathes himself in the glittering
Streams; but when affected with Cold, he dives
into the more solitary Deeps, as most or all
other Fishes do, that burden themselves with
Water, as Age is burdened with Diseases and
Infirmities. But at the Period of bright <HI>Cin|thia</HI>'s
Progress, when the Sun and long Days
have consumed the Recrement of the expiring
<PB N="289" REF="166">
Winter; then you shall find him sporting, and
picking among the gliding silver Streams of
<HI>Trent:</HI> so in most Rivers in the confines of the
Kingdom; where you may recreate your self,
and refresh him with a Bank, Stone, or Flag|fly;
as the Opportunity of the Place, and the
Season of the Year presents.</P>
<P>For in the Vernon Ingress, if you proffer him
Drakes, either the green or the gray Drake,
he will never refuse them; or should you in|vite
him with their Shadow (<HI>viz.</HI>) the artificial
Resemblance, you complement him with a Cu|riosity:
But the natural Fly, more abundantly
than the Artificial, contributes to his Humour.
But his Ground-bait is the Brandlin, if well
purged in delicate sweet and new Moss; or a
fair large Gentle, well depurated and scoured
in Bran: but the yellow Cod-worm excels all
the rest (as a Flame in Bowdie excels all Colours)
provided it be adorned with the Head of a Fly.
This is the Charm that invites him ashore, and
as soon as any thing brings him to Hand.</P>
<L>The Dace of all Fish is the daring Fish</L>
<L>To sport with Flies, and after in the Dish</L>
<L>He's not to be despis'd; because his end's</L>
<L>To sport the Angler, and to feast his Friends.</L>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>RVFF.</HEAD>
<P>The Ruff, some call him <HI>Pope;</HI> but call him
what you will, for I suppose he obtained that
Title from his infallibility of biting; which he
seldom fails to do, if the Angler happens to
come where he is, and that is almost every
where. This little Desperado, tho he wants
<PB N="290" REF="167">
Conduct, yet has he Resolution and Courage
enough to encounter Death; who seldom as
any Fish gives an Affront, yet rarely or never re|fuses
the Combat. It is true, he is Cautious, but
not Contentious; more a Hero than a Hector;
who never flies, except at the Face of his Ene|my;
and is for the most part constant in Victory,
save only when encountring the victorious Ang|ler.
This little Buckaneer arm'd at all Points,
consorts the Angler, and entertains him at all
times, provided he seek for him near the soli|tary
decays of broken Bridges, ruinous Founda|tions,
and the Roots of Trees. Besides, he
loves Bull-rushes, Beds of Segs and Candocks,
where frequently you may find him. So in Ed|dies,
turns in Water, but in meandring Pools
you will rarely miss of him; and where Stumps,
Stakes, and hollow Banks are, there is he to be
found; otherwise conclude he is not in that Co|lony.</P>
<P>This little resolute Animal, his Stature consi|dered,
is of as great resolution as any Fish that
wags a Fin, and as generous and profuse of his
Life as his Lordship: not unlike the Prodigal,
that hates to out-live his Estate and Patrimony.
The Angler therefore that would civilly treat
him, ought to bring him what he loves, and
that you know is but requisite and reasonable;
and where-ever you find him, it's a hundred
to one that the whole Armado is not far from
him; since for the most part they move all in a
Body. One would think them Mutineers, be|cause
all of a Piece; for if you hang but one,
all the rest are in danger. Nor will they revolt,
or retreat from their Diet, since every one re|solves
<PB N="291" REF="167">
to eat till he die. I fancy them some|what
of the Nature of Negroes, that expect af|ter
Death to return back to the Goldcoast; for
if you bring him but a Brandlin, or a well-purg'd
Gild-tail, he shall shew you his Face, and leap
into the Pannier.</P>
<L>The Ruff, or Pope, inhabits little Holes,</L>
<L>Betwixt the Artick and Antartick Poles:</L>
<L>Who seldom quarels; yet can't well dispense</L>
<L>With an Affront, who arms for his defence.</L>

<HEAD>GVDGEON.</HEAD>
<P>As the Gudgeon is a most delicious Fish, so
ought he to be most delicately drest; and be|cause
the Angler's, and every one's Entertain|ment,
therefore he's preferr'd before many other
Fish that make not so fine a show in the Platter.
It's true, there's no fear to surfeit of a Diet
that's so naturally nutricious, and converts all
into Nourishment, without the Law of Physick.
This piece of curiosity is a curious admirer of
limpid, clear and cristalline Streams, more espe|cially
when surrounded with gentle turns in
Rivers and Rivulets, that have sandy Bottoms;
and if paved with Gravel, it's never the worse;
who almost to a Miracle affects Cleanliness in
eating; and as he loves his Life, loves that his
Meat should always be well washed before he
eats it. This fresh-water Smelt seldom or never
roves abroad as other Fish do, to recreate him|self
with Insects and Flies; but contents him|self
at home with a Gentle, rather than to
ramble abroad for Varieties: for to speak plain
English, his Life is in danger, and Sentence of
<PB N="292" REF="168">
Death pronounced at the sight almost of every
master-Fish. But the Brandlin he adores as his
select Modicum, and the Gild-tail sweetens all
his Diversions: so that if either be brought him
to sport and play with, he would have it vivid,
but not livid; and sweetned and adorned with
an odoriferous Perfume.</P>
<P>Now some Anglers have been pleased to
write various Encomiums on this little curious
piece of Mortality; and they do him right: for
he is a Fish, that not only entertains the Angler
with the Rod, but as if there were a familiarity
betwixt them, nibbles at his Toes, whilst he
muddles in the Streams; diverting not the
Angler only, but the Salmon also. Besides, the
Perch admires him, and the Eel, and the Burbolt
adore him. So do many other Fish, but the Pike
above all Fish no sooner sees him, but his Teeth
water till he taste of the Dainty.</P>
<L>The Gudgeon loves the Water, sweet and clear:</L>
<L>In freshest Streams, and smallest Turns, he's there.</L>
<L>Lock till you find him; then you find your Wish,</L>
<L>If for a Banquet, or a Bait for Fish.</L>

<P>The Bleak or Whitlin is the Summer Intelli|gencer,
and more of a Masculine than a Fe|minine
Nature; that conceals himself (Ladylike)
all the Winter, till long Days and a warm
Sun invites him forth to purchase Flies, which
are sold him sometimes at the rate of his Life.
This Fresh-water Sprat is of most accurate Mo|tion,
and feeds not much unlike the Swallow,
partaking very much of his Nature and Qua|lity,
<PB N="293" REF="168">
as near as Fish and Fowl can do, or as
near as Fish and Flesh can have, and that's as
near as the Elements can admit of: which cer|tainly
is a Secret, yet very observable, if the
Angler but consider their coming in, which is in
the Vernon Ingress; their natural Food, and
their going out together, in the Autumnal
Equinox. You must also remember that he loves
not a Stream, yet would he by no means dwell
far from it; and bites aloft at the Race of
Flies, yet gratifies himself with the Soil of the
Earth. At Mid-water if you seek him, he's so|licitous
after Gentles; and if at the Bottom,
he desires a Brandlin: but he that would court
him to death with a Dainty, must bring him a
parcel of Ant-flies.</P>
<L>The Bleak or Whitlin, floats in silent Deeps</L>

nor need you search him in rapid Streams, for
there he is not, yet dwells not far from them;

How Animals and Insects are lodg'd and

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Th.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray explain your self.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus I explain my self; as the Nature
and Quality of the Earth is, such also are the
Generations and Productions of Animals and
Insects ingendred ther in. Some Products we
observe them to be naturally leprous, and such
are usually struck with morbifick Deformities.
Some again are Prolifick, and animated with
Life; as some others are design'd for Vegetation.
<PB N="296" REF="170">
Some Earths are cold, frigid and moist; on the
contrary some others by reason of the salinity
of Sand, are fortified with Heat almost to
excess. There are also various Complexi|ons
of Earths and Soils, which calify and
indurate by the Sun's Reflection, so incrustate
themselves by Contact and Connexion, that
with little difficulty facilitate a Warmth: so
that whilst some are accidentally Cold, as ar|dent
are othersome because influenced by Calli|faction.
But as some are naturally Cold, by
Northern Influence, destinated to a marly spun|geous
Clay; intemperately Hot are othersome,
by confluence of bituminous and sulphureous
Mixts cooperating with them. Some are bog|gy,
some gravelly, some naturally fertil, other|some
as naturally sterril. All which demonstrate
the various Modification and Methods of Na|ture,
and the Divine preordinate Wisdom of
God the Creator, whose Decrees are inviolable,
and whose Laws are irrevocable; and from
whom Nature in all her Operations copies to
the Life from the first Original. When there|fore
seriously to consider the various Families of
Insects and Animals, naturally protruded and
thrust forth into the World, for the supply of
themselves and their fellow-Creatures, it de|monstrates
a Benevolence, and not a Prodiga|lity
in Nature to stock the Elements with such
a numerous Increase, as my self and others have
curiously inspected. So that sometimes one Ani|mal,
and sometimes another, infinitely excels as
to the Anglers Recreation.</P>
<P>But the Classis of Worms are multiform and
various; manifestly the Lob, or more properly
<PB N="297" REF="170">
the Dew-worm, Knob or knotted Worm; Red|worm,
Brandlin, Gild-tail, Marish-worm;
Flag and Dock-worm, Tag and Tagil, Spot|spere,
Munck and Muck-worm; Cod-worm
and Straw-worm, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But it's impossible to enu|merate
the innumerable Sorts and Varieties of
Worms, and the Texture of Insects, (different
also in Shape, Colour, Beauty and Proportion)
except prophetically instructed beyond the due
mediums of Art, or otherwise inspected by
natural Observation: As when to imagine some
of them smooth, of a contrary Quality are
those that are ruff, fretted, and knotted. The
various like we read of Colour, Form, Beauty,
Proportion and Complexion; as when to in|spect
some of them Red, some others Green,
some Red and Green with a greenish Cast; and
some Green with a reddish Tincture; and some
affected with a glance of both: Some again
display a brownish blewish and purplish Rube|do;
some others shine forth a Citrine Colour;
so that some are Yellowish, and some again
Orange; some are Gray, some Livid, some
Veril, some Azure, and some more obscure, im|prest
with various Signatures and remarkable
Observations. Nature generously provides
multiplicity of this animal Race, whereby to
furnish her Common-Weal, and accommodate
her solicitous Admirers. But of all the Worms
that move in the Earth, the Gild-tail alone is the
Angler's <HI>Corona.</HI></P>

Reward, when proportioned to propagate the
Sovereign Ray of Health; but not that I extol
the luxurious Angler, that prefers the Platter

the Progress of the Life of one Fish, charita|bly
endeavour the multiplication of Thousands;
otherwise he that voraciously pursues his Ex|ercise,
either spoils the Creatures to gratify his

<P>I approve of your Morals and modest

the Death of Fish for Fancy? Nay, who would
not study to prolong their Lives, were it for no
other End than to furnish the Fords, to relieve
the Necessitous, and divert the Angler? Were
not the Ends of the Creation made answerable
to the Means of Preservation? Who disputes
it? Then if so, let me tell you that immoderate
Exercise (in all or any one) puts a damp to
Pleasure; and if the End of Pleasure can be
adjudged Destruction, then no Man can be satis|fied
without Excess. And what is Excess but
inordinate Riot, that makes a breach in the
Royal Commandments, in opposition to Life, so
results in Death? Where note, this Distinction
is necessary to be understood; that as Rods and
Nets are different Means, so they also answer to
different Ends. The first, if when to consult
rapid and roling Streams; but the latter results
<PB N="399" REF="171">
in such Parts of Water, where no Line nor
Rod claims a right of Privilege; or with such

Alphabet Anglers, that wander up and down
besides themselves, to lick up the spumous Froth
of Fiction, and rally the Records of fabulous
Pamphleteers, to swell their impoverished empty
Volumes, on purpose spread abroad to amuze
the unwary: but this I resolve against, by ex|horting
Ingenuity to consult Experience, not|withstanding
my Rudiments and laborious Di|rections;
for without due observation in the Ex|ercise
of Angling, besides Speculation in the
Progress of Theory (in this, or indeed in any
other Art) no Man shall level a right Founda|tion.</P>

<P>Such signal Remonstrations (like a in|gressive
Spirit) strike deep Impressions into my
thoughtful Breast. It must be a Master; and
what Maste<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> but Experience must we have, to
induct us i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters"> the Methods, Mediums and Re|gularities
of Science? Does Experience any more
obliterate Theory, than Rudiments rip up the
Foundation of Art? which they do not, nor
cannot: then ought the Rules of Practicks to
be the solicitation of every Artist, which Ana|lysis
of necessity I cannot but comply with; or
let the surviving Ages engrave on my Tomb|stone,
<HI>Post est occasio calva.</HI></P>

<P>To compleat a Scholar therefore, we are
to consider that every Pedagogue that initiates
his Novice into the Rudiments of Grammar,
gives him Literature first. After the same
<PB N="301" REF="172">
manner, and not altering my Methods, I have
laid down the Rules and Hypotheses of the
Ground-bait. Where note, I prefer the Worm
for the Angler's Exercise (if artificially scou|red)
as a general Bait before any other, and
upon all Occasions (inordinate Seasons excepted)
if purposing thereby to consult the Bottom
(as also the innumerable families of Fish:) and
so farewel, for it's almost Sun-set.</P>

<L>'Tis true, a Star fell on a Shrine of Earth,</L>

<L>Conduct and Reason, and a Soul immortal,</L>
