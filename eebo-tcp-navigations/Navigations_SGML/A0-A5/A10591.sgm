<HEAD>Late and admirable Newes, from the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> and the Countrey of the great
<HI>Magor,</HI> te&s;tified by per&s;ons of great import, as &s;hall appeare.</HEAD>
<P>_IN the yeare of our Lord 1618. and in the moneth of Iune, we arrived at the Cape of <HI>Good
hope,</HI> where we found the people of the Countrey, albeit Heathen and Idolaters, yet very kind
and friendly vnto vs, for &s;ome &s;mall quantitie of I|ron and old Copper, we had of them vpon
exchange Beeues and Mutton. This Cape (otherwi&s;e called the Cape of <HI>Bona Speran&s;a</HI>) is
very temperate, and agreeth well with the con&s;titution of our people. Foure or fiue hundred
per&s;ons, &s;icke of the &s;curvie, and other di&s;ea&s;es of the Sea, they all recovered their
health perfectly within a very few dayes.</P>
<P>They haue a very plea&s;ant drinke, which they call <HI>Toddye,</HI> like in ta&s;te to white
Wine, which di&s;telleth from the Pahneto trees. At our departure from this Cape we &s;ayled two or
three dayes in a Sea like in collour to whey, who&s;e bottome could not &s;ound.</P>
<P>We came afterwards to the Countrey of the great <HI>Magor,</HI> or as &s;ome call him
<HI>Magull,</HI> his La&s;car, which is his Traine, which followeth and alwayes goeth with him in
his progre&s;&s;es, con&s;i&s;teth v&s;ually of
<PB N="2" REF="3">200000. people of all &s;orts. The&s;e lodge all in fayre Tents, richly hanged,
which being pitched accor|ding to the order of that Countrey, they make a ve|ry gorgeous and
glorious &s;how, as of a mo&s;t beauti|full and large Cittie.</P>
<P>This <HI>Magor,</HI> hath a place called the <HI>Maoll,</HI> in which he keepeth a thou&s;and
women to &s;erue his lu&s;tfull de&s;ires.</P>
<P>When he maketh his progre&s;&s;e, his Concubines goe with him in all &s;umptuous maner, carried
vpon Elephants in Ca&s;tles, richly covered, or vppon mens &s;houlders, in a frame made like the
vpper part of a Coach, but not &s;o clo&s;e covered. He hath vnder him 37. Provinces, and very many
goodly Citties: the length of his Countrey is 2800 myles: the breadth 1900 myles.</P>
<P>When he admitteth to his pre&s;ence the Per&s;ian Emba&s;&s;ador, or the Emba&s;&s;ador of any
other migh|tie King, when he giueth them either louing or kind &s;peeches, or lookes, then the
Emba&s;&s;adors in token of thankfulne&s;&s;e, ki&s;&s;e the earth. But Sir <HI>Thomas Roe</HI> the
King of Great <HI>Brittaynes</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador would not &s;o much derogate from his place, to
aba&s;e him&s;elfe &s;o demi&s;&s;iuely. Notwith&s;tanding, he was alwayes en|tertained with more
and greater re&s;pects then any o|ther Emba&s;&s;ador.</P>
<P>This <HI>Magor,</HI> doth euery yeere weigh him&s;elfe in a Ballance made for the purpo&s;e;
fir&s;t, he weigheth him&s;elfe with waights of Siluer, next he weigheth him&s;elfe with waights of
Gold, and la&s;tly, with Iewels, and precious &s;tones: his waight of &s;iluer, and gold, he giueth
away liberally at his plea&s;ure, after
<PB N="3" REF="3">he is weighed, he mounteth into his Throne, and then he throweth among&s;t the
&s;tanders by, a great quantitie of Siluer and Gold, made hollow, like to the forme of Nutmeggs,
and &s;uch other Spices, which his Countrey doth afford. The&s;e ceremo|nies being ended, then he
beginneth to Carow&s;e and largely to drinke with his Nobles, till they be all drunke. The Scales
with which he is weighed, are all of ma&s;&s;ie Gold, richly be&s;et with precious &s;tones.</P>
<P>No man hath any Land in this <HI>Magors</HI> Countrey but him&s;elfe, he giueth pentions and
taketh away pentions at his plea&s;ure. No child inherits any thing which his Father had in
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but at the plea|&s;ure of <HI>Magor:</HI> all Honor and Gentilitie dyeth with
the per&s;on who had any, and returnes backe to the <HI>Magor.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;heweth him&s;elfe in publike and open maner to the people, at the lea&s;t, three times in
a day; fir&s;t, at the Sunne-ri&s;ing, to which he maketh low Reue|rence. Secondly, at noone, at
which time he &s;eeth Elephants fight, or &s;ome other pa&s;times prouided for him. Thirdly, before
the Sunne &s;et, but when the Sunne is &s;etting he de&s;cendeth from his Throne, and &s;heweth as
low obey+&s;ance as he did at the ri&s;ing.</P>
<P>At all the&s;e times, who&s;oeuer commeth vnto him as a Sutor, v&s;eth no other meanes for his
di&s;patch, but to hold vp a paper in his hand, and he is heard immediately, and encountreth the
be&s;t fortune which Sutors can de&s;ire, for either he pre&s;ently ob|taineth his Sute, or hath a
pre&s;ent deniall; there are no ma&s;ters of Reque&s;ts, nor any delatory references vpon any
petition.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P><HI>Magors</HI> people are gouerned by no other lawes but what lie in his brea&s;t, and the
brea&s;ts of his coun|&s;ellors, yet there is no place where bu&s;ine&s;&s;es are &s;ooner
di&s;patched, or where Iu&s;tice is more vpright|ly and vnpartially mini&s;tred.</P>
<P><HI>Cur&s;ero,</HI> the elde&s;t Sonne of <HI>Magor,</HI> being of an haughtie and a&s;piring
Spirit, practi&s;ed to take from his Father both Crowne and kingdome, but <HI>Magor</HI> not onely
tooke his &s;onne pri&s;oner, but with him &s;ome 2000. of his chiefe&s;t followers, having taken
his &s;onne, he placed him to &s;ee the execution of tho&s;e two thou&s;and he had taken. The
manner of the execution being terrible, for they were put into the ground vpon &s;harpe &s;takes,
and &s;o left to dye. After this execution, <HI>Magor</HI> &s;hut vp and &s;ealed his &s;onnes
eyes, &s;o that for three yeares he &s;aw no light of Sunne or Moone at all: &s;eaven yeares he
kept him in clo&s;e Pri&s;on, but at this time he hath a little more liberty. This Prince is of a
different di&s;po&s;ition from his Father, for he keepeth but one wife, and is a great fauourer and
protector of Chri&s;tians; he is generally beloued of all men. <HI>Magor</HI> will not vndertake,
nor do any bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of import, but as he &s;hall be directed and coun&s;ailed by his
A&s;trologers, and Magitians, when they tell him the day and houre are fortunate then hee
adventureth vpon any thing, hee cannot endure to heare any talke or mention made of Death which is
the mo&s;t de&s;perate and greate&s;t follie which our age can or doth afford, nay what
madne&s;&s;e is it? not to heare talke, nor make provi&s;ion for that which cannot bee avoyded. God
hath pointed nothing more certaine then Death, becau&s;e wee &s;hould ever
<PB N="5" REF="4">con&s;ider of it; and nothing more vncertaine, then the houre of Death; becau&s;e
every houre we &s;hould be provided for it. <HI>Magor</HI> being much delighted, with
A&s;trologers, Magitians, and Witches, of which his Country is repleni&s;hed, there came vpon a
time one of that Crue vnto him, and pre&s;ented vnto him an Ape; telling <HI>Magor,</HI> that the
Ape could doe &s;trange and admirable <HI>Tricks:</HI> well quoth <HI>Magor</HI> we will make
tryall of your Apes skill, and cunning, &amp; thereupon commanded the Ape and her Ma&s;ter to be
carried out of that roome, into another that they might not &s;ee what was done, in their ab&s;ence
<HI>Magor</HI> tooke a Ring from his finger, &amp; hauing al|wayes about him a great number of
Boyes, &s;ome 200. or thereabouts, <HI>which hee keepeth for vnnaturall and bea&s;tly v&s;es,</HI>
he gaue the Ring to one of the Boyes and bad him hide it, then the&s;e Boyes flocking to|gether,
the Ape and his Ma&s;ter were called for: now quoth <HI>Magor</HI> let your Ape trie her skill, I
haue lo&s;t my Ring, let vs &s;ee if &s;hee can finde it; the Apes Ma&s;ter commanded the Ape to
fetch the Ring, the Ape went immedidately to the Boy which had the Ring and tooke it out of his
bo&s;ome and brought it to <HI>Magor.</HI></P>
<P>Who wondring much at it, he cau&s;ed the &s;econd time the Ape and her ma&s;ter to retire out of
&s;ight, and in their ab&s;ence, hee cau&s;ed his Secretary to write in &s;everall papers, the
Names of &s;ome twelue or fourteene, of the greate&s;t Gods, and Prophets which either were heard
or knowne to be wor&s;hip|ped, either in his Countrey or in any place of the World, which being
written, they were mingled
<PB N="6" REF="5">on an heape and layd vpon a table, Then the Ape was called for, and commanded to
take the Name of the greate&s;t God &amp; true&s;t Prophet from among&s;t tho&s;e papers, the Ape
went pre&s;ently to the Papers, and turning them vp, from among&s;t them all, one|ly tooke out the
Name of Ie&s;us and delivered it to <HI>Magor,</HI> wherupon <HI>Magor</HI> and the re&s;t of his
Nobles, were much amazed: but vppon &s;ecret conference among&s;t them&s;elues, they re&s;olved to
make further tryall: whereupon the Ma&s;ter and the Ape were commaunded to goe to a further roome,
and &s;ome per&s;ons commanded to watch them, that the &s;u&s;pi|tion, of all deceiueable cour&s;es
might be taken a|way, and cleered: the papers were written againe with the &s;ame Names, and more
were added, which being done; the Ape was called for the &s;econd time, and to make choyce as
formerly &s;hee had bin directed, &s;hee pre&s;ently went to the papers and made the &s;ame choyce,
which before &s;hee had done: which &s;troke <HI>Magor</HI> and his Nobles in a greater a|maze then
at the fir&s;t: notwith&s;tanding a third tryall was made, but with the like &amp; &s;ame
&s;ucce&s;&s;e, where|upon a great Noble man humbly be&s;ought <HI>Magor</HI> that hee might make
the fourth tryall, which was graunted him, this great man was called <HI>Mattolet Chan,</HI> which
in their Language &s;ignifieth (the belo|ved Lord) Hee cau&s;ed the Names to be written the fourth
time, and mingled together, and ca&s;t in a heape vpon the Table, the Ape was called as for|merly
&s;hee had beene, and commanded to make choyce of the greate&s;t God or Prophet, who&s;e name was
conteined in tho&s;e papers. The Ape went pre|&s;ently
<PB N="7" REF="5">to the heape, and &s;lightly and &s;cornefully tur|ned them over, but tooke vp no
paper but returned to her ma&s;ter. <HI>Magor</HI> and his Nobles wondred more at this then of what
pa&s;&s;ed before, and asked the Apes ma&s;ter, what might be the cau&s;e why the Ape would not
bring any paper as before &s;hee had done, but turned them vp in &s;o &s;cornefull a maner, perhaps
quoth the ma&s;ter, the name which the Ape looketh for, is not there among&s;t them; then the
papers be|ing examined, the name of <HI>Ie&s;us</HI> was mi&s;&s;ing, now quoth <HI>Magor,</HI> let
the Ape &s;hew cunning to fetch that paper, wherein that name is written. The Ape receiuing her
command, made pre&s;ent ha&s;t to <HI>Mat|tolet Chan,</HI> and leapt vpon him, and withall thru&s;t
her hand into his bo&s;ome, and drew out the name of <HI>Ie&s;us,</HI> which &s;hee brought
ha&s;tily to <HI>Magor.</HI> This being &s;o &s;trange an accident, was wondred at of all the
&s;tanders by, whereof &s;ome were Iewes, &s;ome Ma|hometans, &s;ome Chri&s;tians, with others.
This hath beene averred to be true, by ma&s;ter <HI>Edward Terry,</HI> Preacher to Sir <HI>Thomas
Roe,</HI> who heard it credibly reported, as afore&s;aid. And Sir <HI>Thomas Roe</HI> hath
re|ported the &s;ame for truth to &s;undry right honorable par&s;onages. Ma&s;ter <HI>Terry</HI>
the Preacher hath often &s;eene the Ape.</P>
<P>The great <HI>Magor,</HI> and generally all the <HI>Indians</HI> of his Countrey are giuen over
to fle&s;hly plea&s;ures: they may, and doe keepe as many wiues and concubines as they will, or are
able to maintaine. What mi&s;ery doe the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> endure, to haue &s;o many women
a|bout them, when as there be many Engli&s;h men are grieuou&s;ly vexed to haue the company but of
one.
<PB N="8" REF="6">But perhaps the <HI>Indian</HI> women are of a farre milder temper then the
Engli&s;h, as hereafter &s;hall be &s;hewed. The <HI>Indians</HI> are more jealous of their women
and wiues, then either Spanyards, or Italians. The Father will not tru&s;t his &s;onne, after he
commeth to twelue yeares of Age, except he be gelded. The <HI>Indian</HI> wo|men in their hou&s;es
are commonly covered, and if any woman goe abroad vncovered, &s;hee is reputed a Whore.</P>
<P><HI>Magors</HI> &s;ubiects are tall, and of comely per&s;onage, but of a tawnie coullor, but
they are faint hearted; <HI>Magor</HI> will v&s;ually &s;ay, that one Portingall will beate three
of his &s;ubiects, and one Engli&s;h man will beate three Portingalls. In this Countrey there are
many &s;euerall Sects, &s;ome called <HI>Banians,</HI> who will kill nothing that hath life, no not
&s;o much as &s;nakes. They haue Ho&s;pitalls to keepe and cure lame Hor|&s;es, lame Doggs, lame
Birds, or any lame Creature, and when they be cured, they are &s;et at libertie. The manner of that
Countrey is to burne the bo|dies of the dead, and the wiues willingly burne with their husbands.
But of late the women beginne to breake that cu&s;tome.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> vnder <HI>Magor,</HI> wor&s;hip euill fauoured vgly Idolls, which they
call, <HI>Pagods:</HI> their Prie&s;ts are called <HI>Ioggis,</HI> or <HI>Bramines;</HI> their
Church they call <HI>Muskitts;</HI> they goe on Pilgrimage to &s;euerall places; Some to
<HI>Mecha</HI> in Arabia; Some to the Head of the Riuer <HI>Ianges,</HI> wherein they throw
&s;il|uer and gold, according to their abilities, and after wa&s;h them&s;elues in the River, and
then they thinke they are pure and cleane from all &s;inne.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="6">
<P>The&s;e people haue many fea&s;ts, and many fa&s;ts, which they keepe with &s;undry idle
Ceremonies, &s;ome of them mourne in blew, others as <HI>Iapa|ners,</HI> mourne in white. They are
skilfull in Phy|&s;icke, e&s;pecially, in Simples.</P>
<P>The learning which they haue, which is but &s;mall, is in the Mathematicks, and in Naturall
Phylo&s;ophy; they haue &s;mall &s;tore of Bookes, be|cau&s;e there is no Printing among&s;t them;
all their Bookes are Manu&s;cripts.</P>
<P>Their vulgar &s;peech is called <HI>Indu&s;tan.</HI> The &s;peech at <HI>Magors</HI> Court, is
v&s;ually the Per&s;ian Language. Their learned tongue is the Arabian; the common people are very
apt to immitate any thing which they &s;ee to be done by Strangers.</P>
<P>I cannot let pa&s;&s;e a &s;trange and wonderfull re|port which fell out in <HI>Magors</HI>
Court, and hath beene by Sir <HI>Thomas Roe</HI> reported confidently for Truth. There was a
<HI>Ra&s;a,</HI> (&s;o great Princes are called,) who was an ab&s;olute Athei&s;t, who would
alwayes &s;cornefully, and di&s;dainefully &s;peake and di&s;pute again&s;t the Deitie, not
enduring eyther him&s;elfe, or any other, where hee might oppo&s;e to acknowledge any God-head.
This great Prince &s;porting him&s;elfe among his Concubines, one of them who was mo&s;t fauoured
of the Prince, and might bee mo&s;t bold with him, when hee was flouting, and ie&s;ting again&s;t
the Deitie, pluckt from his brea&s;t an hayre, and withall a droppe of blood followed, which was
not regarded at all at the fir&s;t; This very place within very fewe dayes beganne to fe&s;ter, and
by degrees
<PB N="10" REF="7">grew to that extremitie, that the paine was intolle-rable, and withall prouing
to be a Gangrene; having v&s;ed all the meanes, which Phy&s;icke, or Surgery might afford him, it
proued irrecoverable. This <HI>Ra|&s;a</HI> &s;eeing his e&s;tate, and that he had no hope of life,
but a dreadfull expectation of imminent death, &s;ent to <HI>Magor</HI> to take his leaue of him,
<HI>Magor</HI> &s;ent divers of his Nobles vnto him, to comfort him, with all the be&s;t offers and
&s;peeches which any &s;ubiect might de|&s;ire from &s;o mightie a Monarch. Which when the Nobles
had delivered vnto him, he made an&s;were in this manner; My Lord <HI>Magor,</HI> is a great
Monarch to command vpon earth, but there is a more omnipo|tent Monarch, which hath ab&s;olute
command and power in Heauen and Earth. You all know, I was an oppo&s;er, an enemy, a contemner of
all Deitie, and again&s;t that omnipotent Maie&s;tie of Heauen. He hath now &s;hewed and
manife&s;ted his power and Iu&s;tice vpon me, who now lye in torment, euery minute of an houre
expecting to die. What I would not acknowledge in my life, I am con&s;trained to ac|knowledge and
confe&s;&s;e vpon my death, for wee which liue at randome, and &s;peake at large in our liues, when
death worketh natures di&s;&s;olution, wee are then compelled to change our former opinions, and to
acknowledge our former errors. I was an A|thei&s;t, by my owne experience I dare and can a&s;&s;ure
you, what is one of the greate&s;t cau&s;es of Athei&s;me; wicked liues doe wi&s;h, there were no
God to puni&s;h their offences after this life, and therefore doe flatter them&s;elues in their
life; they frame to them&s;elues all the rea&s;ons they can deui&s;e, to per&s;wade them&s;elues
<PB N="11" REF="7">there is no God. But my Lords, there is no Athei&s;t which dare at the houre of
his death maintaine and defend that Doctrine of Athei&s;me, which he did in life, for nature it
&s;elfe doth con&s;traine them to a terri|ble recantatio~ at the houre of death, as you may now
behold a grieuous example in me: what would not I giue? what would not I do? my Lords if I might
haue longer time of life to acknowledge &amp; confe&s;&s;e free|ly and plainely that God head,
which formerly I haue with &s;corne and malice &s;o wickedly denied: who would haue imagined that I
being a Souldier &s;hould not rather haue died vpon &s;ome honorable wound, given by &s;word or
launce; then &s;o &s;hame|fully to die vpon the plucking of one hayre from my brea&s;t, this kind
of death, as it is mo&s;t &s;hame|full to me, &s;o it doth more manife&s;t, and illu&s;trate the
Divine power to bee mo&s;t Omnipotent and miraculous. My Lords, my vitall powers doe faile mee, I
can &s;peake no more, onely this for a fare|well, which I pray you deliver al&s;o to my great
Soveraigne <HI>Magor,</HI> doe you all flie and take heede of Athei&s;me, &s;eeke out with all the
care and dili|gence you can, thou knowledge of the onely true and Omnipotent God, dare not liue
tho&s;e wicked liues, nor maintaine tho&s;e horrible opinions while&s;t you are in health, which as
you &s;ee mo&s;t manife&s;t|ly in me are &s;o terrible and horrible at this houre of my death;
having ended the&s;e words, this migh|ty Prince dyed.</P>
<P>From <HI>Magors</HI> Countrey wee &s;ayled towardes o|ther Ilands, and arrived at an Iland
called <HI>Zeloon,</HI> which Iland yeeldeth Cinnamon, and other &s;pices
<PB N="12" REF="8">in great aboundance, it yeeldeth al&s;o Pearles, Ru|bies, Saphires, Garnets, and
&s;undry other pretious &s;tones.</P>
<P>From <HI>Zeloon</HI> wee arrived at an Iland called <HI>Sam|matra,</HI> which yeeldeth Pepper,
Gold, Beniamin, Camphire, with &s;undry other Rich Commodities, afterwards we &s;ayled to
<HI>Patanie,</HI> an Iland governed by a Mayden Queene.</P>
<P>From this wee arrived at <HI>Iapan,</HI> which is one of the greate&s;t and goodlie&s;t Ilands
of the World, ha|ving great &s;tore of Gold Mines, and of Silver, they haue Silver, of three
&s;orts all vn&s;tamped, they haue &s;mall plate, which goeth in the market for buying of
victuales: they haue other peeces of plate vn|&s;tamped, more finer Silver, and that goeth in the
Country, to buy all other commodities; they haue a third &s;ort of plate, finer &s;ilver then any
Spani&s;h money, and this is carried away by Strangers.</P>
<P>This Countrey is Governed by an Emperour, who hath vnder him 62. Kings, the Revenews of this
Emperour are infinite, a great part rai&s;ed by Rice, the People of this Countrey are proud and
haughty, very warlike, yet exceeding obedient to their Emperour, and the Kings, to whom they are
Subiects. They are very kinde to Strangers: Iu&s;tice, in this country is &s;evere without
partialitie; Theeues are not impri&s;oned but pre&s;ently executed, If a murther be committed, and
the murtherer e&s;cape, hee who apprehendeth him, hath 300. pounds gi|ven him vpon the deliverie of
the murtherer; &s;o that fewe or none of the murtherers e&s;cape pre&s;ent exe|cution: In this
Countrey a man may walke without
