<OPENER><SALUTE>Noble Sir.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THe good assurance of your native worth, and thrice ge|nerous disposition, as also the continuall manifestation of your bounteous favour, and love towards my selfe in par|ticular, hath so bound my thankfull acknowledgement, that I count it the least part of my service to present the first fruites of my farre-fetcht experience, to the kinde acceptance of your charitable hands: well knowing that though this my worke, owne not worth enough to deserve your patronage, yet such is your benigne humanity, that I am confident you will daigne it your protection, un|der which it willingly shrowdes it selfe. And as it is reported of that man whose name was <HI>Alexander,</HI> being a cowardly milke-sop by nature, yet hearing of the valiant courage of that magnificent <HI>Hero, Alexander</HI> the Great, whose name hee bore, he thenceforth became stout and valorous; and as he was animated by having the very name of puissant <HI>Alexander</HI>; so shall these my weake and feble la|bours,
<PB REF="3">
receive life and courage by the patronage of your much esteemed selfe; whereby they shall bee able to out-face the keenest fanges of a blacke mouth'd <HI>Momus.</HI> For from hence the world may conclude, that either there was some worth in the booke, that caused so wise a person to looke upon it, and to vouchsafe to owne it; or else if they suppose that in charity he fosterd it, as being a poore helpe|lesse brat, they may thence learne to do so likewise. If here I should take upon me the usuall straine of a soothing Epistolizer, I should (though upon better grounds than many) sound forth a full mouth'd en|comiasticke of your incomparable worth: but though your deserts may justly challenge it, yet I know your vertuous modesty would not thanke me for it; and indeed your owne actions are the best <HI>Heralds</HI> of your owne praise, which in spite of en|vy it selfe must speake you Wise, and truly Noble: and I for my part, if I may but present any thing, which either for its profit or delight may obtaine your favourable approbation, I have already rea|ped the harvest of my expectation; onely I must desire you to pardon my bold presumption, as thus to make your well deserving name, the frontispeece to so rude and ill deserving frame. Thus wishing a confluence of all blessings both of the throne, and foot-stoole, to be multiplied upon your selfe, and your vertuous Consort, my very good Lady, toge|ther with all the Stemmes of your Noble family, I take my leave and rest,</P>

<P>_THough I will promise thee no such voluminous discourse, as many have made upon a scanter subject, (though they have travailed no further than the smoake of their owne native chimnies) yet dare I presume to pre|sent thee with the true, and faithfull relation of some few yeares travels and experience, wherein I would be loath to broach any thing which may puzzle thy beleefe, and so justly draw upon my selfe, that unjust aspersion commonly laid on travai|lers; of whom many say, They may lye by authority, be|cause none can controule them; which Proverbe had surely his originall from the sleepy beleefe of many a home-bred Dormouse, who comprehends not either the raritie or possibility of those things he sees not, to whom the most classicke relations seeme riddles, and paradoxes: of whom it may be said as once of <HI>Dioge|nes,</HI> that because he circled himselfe in the circumfe|rence of a tubbe, he therefore contemned the Port and Pallace of <HI>Alexander,</HI> which he knew not. So there is many a tub-brain'd Cyn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cke, who because any thing stranger than ordinary, is too large for the straite hoopes of his apprehension, he peremptorily concludes it is a lye: But I decline this sort of thicke-witted rea|ders,
<PB REF="4">
and dedicate the mite of my endeavours to my more credulous, ingenious, and lesse censorious Coun|try-men, for whose sake I undertooke this worke; and I did it the rather, because there hath some relations heretofore past the Presse, which have beene very im|perfect; as also because there hath beene many scanda|lous and false reports past upon the Country, even from the sulphurious breath of every base ballad-monger: wherefore to perfect the one, and take off the other, I have laid downe the nature of the Country, without a|ny partiall respect unto it, as being my dwelling place where I have lived these foure yeares, and intend God willing to returne shortly againe; but my conscience i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to me a thousand witnesses, that what I speake is the ve|ry truth, and this will informe thee almost as fully con|cerning it, as if thou wentest over to see it. Now where|as I have written the latter part of this relation con|cerning the <HI>Indians,</HI> in a more light and facetious stile, than the former; because their carriage and behaviour hath afforded more matter of mirth, and laughter, than gravity and wisedome; and therefore I have inserted many passages of mirth concerning them, to spice the rest of my more serious discourse, and to make it more pleasant. Thus thou mayest in two or three houres tra|vaile over a few leaves, see and know that, which cost him that writ it, yeares and travaile, over Sea and Land before he knew it; and therefore I hope thou wilt accept it; which shall be my full reward, as it was my whole ambition, and so I rest,</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. Of the Situation, Bayes, Havens, and Inlets.</HEAD>
<P>_FOr as much as the Kings most excellent Majesty hath beene graciously pleasd by the grant of his Letters Patents, at first to give life to the plantations of <HI>New England,</HI> and hath dayly likewise by his Favours and Royall protection cherished their growing hopes; whereby many of his Maje|sties faithfull Subiects haue beene imboldned to venture per|sons, states, and indeavours, to the inlargement of his Domi|nions in that Westerne Continent: Wherefore I thought fit (for the further encouragement of those that hereafter, either by Purse, or Person shall helpe forward the Plantation,) to set forth these few observations out of my personall and expe|riment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll knowledge.</P>
<P>The place whereon the <HI>English</HI> have built their Colonies, is judged by those who have best skill in discovery, either to
<PB N="2" REF="8">
be an Iland, surrounded on the North side with the spacious River <HI>Cannada,</HI> and on the South with <HI>Hudsons</HI> River, or else a <HI>Peninsula,</HI> these two Rivers overlapping one another, having their rise from the great Lakes which are not farre off one another, as the <HI>Indians</HI> doe certainely informe us. But it is not my intent to wander far from our Patent; wherefore I referre you to the thrice memorable discoverer of those parts, Captaine <HI>Smith,</HI> who hath likewise fully described the Sou|therne and North-east part of <HI>New England,</HI> with the noted head-lands, Capes, Harbours, Rivers, Ponds, and Lakes, with the nature of the Soyle, and commodities both by Sea and Land, &amp;c. within the degrees of fourty one and fourty five.</P>
<P>The Bay of <HI>Massachusets</HI> lyeth under the degree of fourty two and fourty three, bearing South-west from the Lands end of <HI>England</HI>: at the bottome whereof are situated most of the <HI>English</HI> plantations: This Bay is both safe, spacious, and deepe, free from such cockling Seas as runne upon the Coast of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and in the Channels of <HI>England</HI>: there be no stiffe running Currents, or Rockes, Shelves, Barres, Quicksands. The Mariners having sayled two or three Leagues towards the bottome, may behold the two Capes embracing their welcome Ships in their Armes, which thrust themselves out into the Sea in forme of a halfe-moone, the surrounding shore being high, and shewing many white Cliffes in a most pleasant prospect with divers places of low land, out of which divers Riuers vent themselves into the Ocean, with many openings, where is good Harbouring for Ships of any burthen; so that if an unexpected storme or crosse winde should barre the Marriner from recovering his desired Port, he may reach other Harbours, as <HI>Plimmouth, Cape, Ann, Salom, Marvill Head</HI>; all which afford good ground for Anchorage, being likewise land-lockt from Winde and Seas. The chiefe and usuall Harbour, is the still Bay of <HI>Mas|sachusets,</HI> which is close aboard the plantations, in which most of our ships come to anchor, being the nearest their mart, and usuall place of landing of Passengers; it is a safe and plea|sant Harbour within, having but one common and safe entrance,
<PB N="3" REF="8">
and that not very broad, there scarce being roome for 3. Ships to come in board and board at a time, but being once within, there is roome for the Anchorage of 500. Ships.</P>
<P>This Harbour is made by a great company of Ilands, whose high Cliffes shoulder out the boistrous Seas, yet may easily deceiue any unskilfull Pilote; presenting many faire openings and broad sounds, which afford too shallow waters for any Ships, though navigable for Boates and small pinnaces. The entrance into the great Haven is called <HI>Nantascot</HI>; which is two Leagues from <HI>Boston</HI>; this place of it selfe is a very good Haven, where Ships commonly cast Anchor, untill Winde and Tyde serve them for other places; from hence they may sayle to the River of <HI>Wessaguscus, Naponset, Charles</HI> River, and <HI>Misticke</HI> River, on which Rivers bee seated many Townes. In any of these fore-named harbours, the Sea-men having spent their old store of Wood and Water, may haue fresh supplies from the adjacent Ilands, with good timber to repaire their weather-beaten Ships&punc; Here likewise may be had Masts or Yards, being store of such Trees as are usefull for the same purpose.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. Of the Seasons of the yeare, Winter and Summer, toge|ther with the Heate, Cold, Snow, Raine, and the effects of it.</HEAD>
<P>FOr that part of the Countrey wherein most of the <HI>English</HI> have their habitations: it is for certaine the best ground and sweetest Climate in all those parts, bearing the name of <HI>New England,</HI> agreeing well with the temper of our <HI>English</HI> bodies, being high land, and sharpe Ayre, and though most of our <HI>English</HI> Townes border upon the Sea-coast, yet are they not often troubled with Mists, or unwhole|some fogges, or cold weather from the Sea, which lies East and South from the Land. And whereas in <HI>England</HI> most of the cold windes and weathers come from the Sea, and those
<PB N="4" REF="9">
situations are counted most unwholesome, that are neare the Sea-coast, in that Countrey it is not so, but otherwise; for in the extremity of Winter, the North-east and South winde comming from the Sea, produceth warme weather, and bringing in the warme-working waters of the Sea, loosneth the frozen Bayes, carrying away their Ice with thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Tides, melting the Snow, and thawing the ground; onely the North-west winde comming over the Land, is the cause of extreame cold weather, being alwaies accompanied with deepe Snowes and bittter Frost, so that in two or three dayes the Rivers are passable for horse and man. But as it is an Axiome in Na|ture, <HI>Nullum viole<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tum est perpetuum,</HI> No extreames last long, so this cold winde blowes seldome above three dayes together, after which the weather is more tollerable, the Aire being nothing so sharpe, but peradventure in foure or five dayes after this cold m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ssenger will blow a fresh, com|manding every man to his house, forbidding any to out-face him without prejudice to their noses: but it may be objected that it is too cold a Countrey for our <HI>English</HI> men, who have beene accustomed to a warmer Climate, to which it may be answered, <HI>(Igne levatur hyems)</HI> there is Wood good store, and better cheape to build warme houses, and make good fires, which makes the Winter lesse tedious: and moreover, the extremity of this cold weather lasteth but for two Moneths or ten weekes, beginning in <HI>December,</HI> and breaking up the tenth day of <HI>February</HI>; which hath beene a passage very re|markeable, that for ten or a dozen yeares the weather hath held himselfe to his day, unlooking his ycie Bayes and Rivers, which are never frozen againe the same yeare, except there be some small frost untill the middle of <HI>March.</HI> It is obser|ved by the <HI>Indians</HI> that every tenth yeare th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re is little or no Winter, which hath beene twice observed of the <HI>English</HI>; the yeare of new <HI>Plimouth</HI> mens arrivall was no Winter in comparison; and in the tenth yeare after likewise when the great company set led themselves in <HI>Massachusets</HI> Bay, was a very milde season, little Frost, and lesse Snow, but cleare serene weather, few North-west winds, which was a great mercy to the <HI>English</HI> comming over so rawly and uncomfort|ably

provided, wanting all utensils and provisions which be|longed to the well being of Planters: and whereas many died at the beginning of the plantations, it was not because the Coun|try was unhealthfull, but because their bodies were corrupted with sea-diet, which was naught, their Beefe and Porke being tainted, their Butter and Cheese corrupted, their Fish rotten, &amp; voyage long, by reason of crosse Windes, so that winter ap|proaching before they could get warme houses, and the sear|ching sharpnes of that purer Climate, creeping in at the crannies of their crazed bodies, caused death and sicknesse; but their harmes having taught future voyagers more wisedome, in ship|ping good provision for Sea, and finding warme houses at lan|ding, finde health in both. It hath bin observed, that of five or sixe hundred passengers in one yeare, not above three have died at Sea, having their health likewise at Land. But to returne to the matter in hand dayly observations makes it apparant, that the peircing cold of that Country produceth not so many noy|some effects, as the raw winters of <HI>England.</HI> In publike assem|blies it is strange to heare a man sneeze or cough as ordinarily they doe in old <HI>England</HI>; yet not to smother any thing, lest you judge me too partiall in reciting good of the Countrey, and not bad; true it is, that some venturing too nakedly in extreamity of cold, being more foole hardy than wise, have for a time lost the use of their feete, others the use of their fingers; but time and Surgery afterwards recovered them: Some haue had their over-growne beards so frozen together, that they could not get their strong water-bottells into their mouthes; I never heard of any that utterly perished at land with cold, saving one <HI>English</HI> man and an <HI>Indian,</HI> who going together a Fowling, the morning being faire at their setting out, afterward a ter|rible storme arising, they intended to returne home; but the storme being in their faces, and they not able to with-stand it, were frozen to death, the <HI>Indian</HI> having gained three slight-shot more of his journey homewa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, was found reared up against a tree with his <HI>Aqua-vitae</HI> bottle at his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> seco~d passage (concerning which many thinke hardly of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ountry in regard of his cold) was the miscarriage of a boate at sea, cer|taine men having intended a voyage to new <HI>Plimouth,</HI> se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing

<P>The Countrey is not so extreamely cold, unlesse it be when the North-west winde is high, at other times it is ordinary for Fishermen to goe to Sea in <HI>Ianuary</HI> and <HI>February,</HI> in which time they get more Fish, and better than in Summer, onely observing to reach some good Harbours before night, where by good fires they sleepe as well and quietly, (having their mayne sayle tented at their backes, to shelter them from the winde) as if they were at home. To relate how some <HI>English</HI> bodies have borne out cold, will (it may be) startle beleife of some, it being so strange, yet not so strange as true. A certaine man being something distracted, broke a|way from his Keeper, and running into the Wood, could not bee found with much seeking after; but foure dayes be|ing expired, he returned, to appearance as well in body, as at his egresse, and in minde much better: for a mad man to hit home through the unbeaten Woods, was strange, but to live without meate or drinke in the deepe of Winter, stranger, and yet returne home bettered, was most strange: but if truth may gaine beleefe, you may behold a more superlative strangenesse.

<P>The hard Winters are commonly the fore-runners of plea|sant Spring-times, and fertile Summers, being iudged likewise to make much for the health of our <HI>English</HI> bodies: It is found to be more healthfull for such as shall adventure thither, to come towards Winter, than the hot Summer; the Climate in Winter is commonly cold and dry, the Snow lies long, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hought to be no small nourishing to the ground.

The Summers be hotter than in <HI>England</HI>; because of their more Southerne latitude, yet are they tollerable; being often coo|led with fresh blowing windes, it seldome being so hot as men are driven from their labours, especially such whose imploy|ments are within doores, or under the coole shade: servants have hitherto beene priviledged to rest from their labours in extreame hot weather, from ten of the clocke till two, which they regaine by their early rising in the morning, and double di|ligence in coole weather. The Summers are commonly hot and dry, there being seldome any raines; I have knowne it sixe or seaven weekes, before one shower hath moystened the Plowmans labour, yet the Harvest hath beene very good, the <HI>Indian</HI> Corne requiring more heate than wet; for the <HI>English</HI> Corne, it is refresht with the nightly dewes, till it grow vp to shade his roots with his owne substance from the parching Sunne.

<P>In <HI>New England</HI> both men and women keepe their natu|rall complexions, in so much as Sea men wonder when they arrive in those parts, to see their Countrey-men so fresh and ruddy: If the Sunne doth tanne any, yet the Winters cold restores them to their former complexion; and as it is for the outward complexion, so it is for the inward constitution; not very many being troubled with inflammations, or such disea|ses as are encreased by too much heate: and whereas I say, not very many, yet dare I not exclude any; for death being cer|taine to all, in all Nations there must be something tending to death of like certainty. The soundest bodies are mortall and subject to change, therefore fall into diseases, and from diseases to death. Now the two chiefe messengers of mortality, be <HI>Fea|vers</HI> and <HI>Callentures</HI>; but they be easily helpt, if taken in time, and as easily prevented of any that will not prove a meere foole to his body. For the common diseases of <HI>England,</HI> they be strangers to the <HI>English</HI> now in that strange Land.

<HEAD>CHAP. IIII. Of the nature of the Soyle.</HEAD>
<P>THe Soyle is for the generall a warme kinde of earth, there being little cold-spewing and, no Morish Fennes, no Quagmires, the lowest grounds be the Marshes, over which every full and change the Sea flowes: these Marshes be rich ground, and bring plenty of Hay, of which the Cattle feed and like, as if they were fed with the best up-land Hay in <HI>New England</HI>; of which likewise there is great store which growes commonly betweene the Marshes and the Woods. This Medow ground lies higher than the Marshes, whereby it is freed from the over-flowing of the Seas; and besides this, in many places where the Tre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> grow thinne, there is good fodder to be got amongst the Woods. There be likewise in divers places neare the plantations great broad Medowes, wherein grow neither shrub nor Tree, lying low, in which Plaines growes as much grasse, as may be throwne out with a Sithe, thicke and long, as high as a mans middle; some as high as the shoulders, so that a good mower may cut three loads in a day. But many obiect, this is but a course fodder:
<PB N="11" REF="12">
True it is, that it is not so fine to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> eye as <HI>English</HI> grasse, but it is not sowre, though it grow thus ranke; but being made into Hay, the Cattle eate it as well as it were Lea-hay and like as well with it; I doe not thinke <HI>England</HI> can shew, fairer Cattle either in Winter, or Summer, than is in those parts both Winter and Summer; being generally larger and better of milch, and bring forth young as ordinarily as Cattle doe in <HI>England,</HI> and have hitherto beene free from many diseases that are incident to Cattle in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>To returne to the Subject in hand, there is so much hay-ground in the Countrey, as the richest voyagers that shall venture thither, neede not feare want of fodder, though his Heard increase into thousands, there being thousands of Acres that yet was never medled with. And whereas it hath beene reported, that some hath mowne a day for halfe of a loade of Hay: I doe not say, but it may be true, a man may doe as much, and get as little in <HI>England,</HI> on <HI>Salisbury</HI> Plaine, or in other places where Grasse cannot be expected: So Hay-ground is not in all places in <HI>New England:</HI> Wherefore it shall behoue every man according to his calling, and estate, to looke for a fit situation at the first; and if hee be one that intends to live on his stocke, to choose the grassie Vallies before the woody Mountaines. Furthermore, whereas it hath beene ge|nerally reported in many places of <HI>England,</HI> that the Grasse growes not in those places where it was cut the fore-going yeares, it is a meere falshood; for it growes as well the en|suing Spring as it did before, and is more spiery and thicke, like our <HI>English</HI> Grasse: and in such places where the Cattle use to graze, the ground is much improved in the Woods, growing more grassie, and lesse weedy. The worst that can be sayd against the meddow-grounds, is because there is little edish, or after-pasture, which may proceede from the late mowing, more than from any thing else; but though the edish be not worth much, yet is there such plenty of other Grasse and feeding, that there is no want of Winter-fodder till <HI>De|cember,</HI> at which time men beginne to house their milch-cattle and Calves: Some, notwithstanding the cold of the Winter, have their young Cattle without doores, giving
<PB N="12" REF="13">
them meate at morning and evening. For the more upland grounds, there be different kinds, in some places clay, some gravell, some a red sand; all which are covered with a black mould, in some places above a foote deepe, in other places not so deepe. There be very few that have the experience of the ground, that can condemne it of barrennesse; although many deeme it barren, because the <HI>English</HI> use to manure their land with fish, which they doe not because the land could not bring corne without it, but because it brings more with it; the land likewise being kept in hart the longer: be|sides, the plenty of fish which they have for little or nothing, is better so used, than cast away; but to argue the goodnesse of the ground, the <HI>Indians</HI> who are too lazie to catch fish, plant corne eight or ten yeares in one place without it, ha|ving very good crops. Such is the rankenesse of the ground that it must bee sowne the first yeare with <HI>Indian</HI> Corne, which is a soaking graine, before it will be fit for to receive <HI>English</HI> seede. In a word, as there is no ground so purely good, as the long forced and improoved grounds of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> so is the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> none so extreamely bad as in many places of <HI>England,</HI> that as yet have not beene manured and impro|ved; the woods of <HI>New England</HI> being accounted better ground than the Forrests of <HI>England</HI> or woodland ground, or heathy plaines.</P>
<P>For the naturall soyle, I preferre it before the countrey of Surry, or Middlesex, which if they were not inriched with continuall manurings, would be lesse fertile than the meanest ground in <HI>New England,</HI> wherefore it is neyther impossi|ble, nor much improbable, that upon improvements the soile may be as good in time as <HI>England.</HI> And whereas some ga|ther the ground to be naught, and soone out of hart, because <HI>Plimouth</HI> men remove from their old habitations, I answer, they do no more remove from their habitation, than the Ci|tizen w^c^h hath one house in the Citty &amp; another in the Coun|trey, for his pleasure, health, &amp; profit. For although they have taken new plots of ground, and built houses upon them, yet doe they retaine their old houses still, and repaire to them every Sabbath day; neyther doe they esteeme their old lots

worse than when they first tooke them: what if they doe not plant on them every yeare?

Gooseberries, Bilberies, Resberies, Treackleberies, Hurtle|berries, Currants; which being dryed in the Sunne are lit|tle inferiour to those that our Grocers sell in <HI>England</HI>: This land likewise affoards Hempe and Flax, some naturally, and some planted by the <HI>English,</HI> with Rapes if they bee well managed. For such commodities as lie underground, I can|not out of mine owne experience or knowledge say much, having taken no great notice of such things; but it is cer|tainely reported that there is Iron, stone; and the <HI>Indians</HI> in|forme us that they can leade us to the mountaines of blacke Lead, and have showne us lead ore, if our small judgement in such things doe not deceive us: and though no body dare confidently conclude, yet dare they not utterly deny, but that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> blisse may lye hid in the barren Mountaines, such as have coasted the countrey affirme that they know where to fetch Seacole if wood were scant; there is plenty of stone both rough and smooth, usefull for many things, with quarries of Slate, out of which they get covering for houses, with good clay, whereof they make Tiles and Brickes, and pavements for their necessary uses.</P>
<P>For the Countrey it is as well watered as any land under the Sunne, every family, or every two families having a spring of sweet waters betwixt them, which is farre diffe|rent from the waters of <HI>England,</HI> being not so sharpe, but of a fatter substance, and of a more jetty colour; it is thought there can be no better water in the world, yet dare I not pre|ferre it before good Beere, as some have done, but any man will choose it before bad Beere, Wheay, or Buttermilke&punc; Those that drinke it be as healthfull, fresh, and lustie, as they that drinke beere; These springs be not onely within land, but likewise bordering upon the Sea coasts, so that some times the tides overflow some of them, which is accounted rare in the most parts of <HI>England.</HI> No man hitherto hath beene constrained to digge deepe for his water, or to fetch it farre, or to fetch of severall waters for severall uses; one kind of water serving for washing, and brewing and other things. Now besides these springs, there be divers spaci|ous ponds in many places of the Countrey, out of which
<PB N="15" REF="14">
runne many sweet streames, which are constant in their course both winter and summer, whereat the Cattle quench their thirst, and upon which may be built water mills, as the plantation encreases.</P>
<P>The next commoditie the land affords, is good store of Woods, &amp; that not onely such as may be needfull for fewell, but likewise for the building of Ships, and houses, &amp; Mils, and all manner of water-worke about which Wood is needefull. The Timber of the Countrey growes straight, and tall, some trees being twenty, some thirty foot high, before hee spread forth his branches; generally the Trees be not very thicke, though there be many that will serve for Mill posts, some beeing three foote and a halfe o're. And whereas it is gene|rally conceived, that the woods grow so thicke, that there is no more cleare ground than is hewed out by labour of man; it is nothing so; in many places, divers Acres being cleare, so that one may ride a hunting in most places of the land, if he will venture himselfe for being lost: there is no underwood saving in swamps, and low grounds that are wet, in which the <HI>English</HI> get Osiers, and Has<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, and such small wood as is for their use. Of these swamps, some be ten, some twenty, some thirty miles long, being preserved by the wetnesse of the soile wherein they grow; for it be|ing the custome of the <HI>Indians</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o burne the wood in <HI>Novem|ber,</HI> when the grasse is withered, and leaves dryed, it con|sumes all the underwood, and rubbish, which otherwise would over grow the Country, making it unpassable, and spoyling their much affected hunting: so that by this meanes in those places where the <HI>Indians</HI> inhabit, there is scarce a bush or bramble, or any combersome underwood to bee seene in the more champion ground. Small wood growing in these places where the fire could not come, is preserved. In some places where the <HI>Indians</HI> dyed of the Plague some foureteene yeares agoe, is much underwood, as in the mid way betwixt <HI>Wessaguscus</HI> and <HI>Plimouth,</HI> because it hath not beene burned; cer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aine Rivers stopping the fire from com|ming to cleare that place of the countrey, hath made it un|usefull and troublesome to travell thorow, in so much that

</LG>
<P>Though many of these trees may seeme to have epithites contrary to the nature of them as they grow in <HI>England,</HI> yet are they agreeable with the Trees of that Countrie. The chiefe and common Timber for ordinary use is Oake, and Walnut: Of Oakes there be three kindes, the red Oake, white, and blacke; as these are different in kinde, so are they chosen for such uses as they are most fit for, one kind being more fit for clappboard, others for sawne board, some fitter for shipping, others for houses. These Trees affoard much Mast for Hogges, especially every third yeare, bearing a bigger Acorne than our <HI>English</HI> Oake. The Wallnut tree is
<PB N="17" REF="15">
something different from the <HI>English</HI> Wallnut, being a great deale more tough, and more serviceable, and altoge|ther as heavie: and whereas our Gunnes that are stocked with <HI>English</HI> Wallnut, are soone broaken and cracked in frost, beeing a brittle Wood; we are driven to stocke them new with the Country Wallnut, which will indure all blowes, and weather; lasting time out of minde. These trees beare a very good Nut, something smaller, but nothing inferiour in sweetnesse and goodnesse to the <HI>English</HI> Nut, having no bitter pill. There is likewise a tree in some part of the Countrey, that beares a Nut as bigge as a small peare. The Cedar tree is a tree of no great growth, not bearing above a foot and a halfe square at the most, neither is it very high. I suppose they be much inferiour to the Cedars of <HI>Lebanon</HI> so much commended in holy writ. This wood is more desired for ornament than substance, being of colour red and white like Eugh, smelling as sweete as Iuniper; it is commonly used for seeling of houses, and ma|king of Chests, Boxes, and staves. The Firre and Pine bee trees that grow in many places, shooting up exceeding high, especially the Pine: they doe afford good masts, good board, Rozin and Turpentine. Out of these Pines is gotten the candlewood that is so much spoken of, which may serve for a shift amongst poore folkes; but I cannot commend it for singular good, because it is something sluttish, dropping a pitchie kinde of substance where it stands. Here no doubt might be good done with saw mils; for I have seene of these stately highgrowne trees, ten miles together close by the River side, from whence by shipping they might be conveyed to any desired Port. Likewise it is not improbable that Pitch and Tarre may be forced from these trees, which beare no other kinde of fruite. For that countrey Ash, it is much different from the Ash of <HI>England,</HI> being brittle and good for little, so that Wallnut is used for it. The Horne-bound tree is a tough kind of Wood, that requires so much paines in riving as is almost incredible, being the best for to make boates and dishes, not being subject to cracke or leake. This tree growing with broad spread Armes, the
<PB N="18" REF="16">
vines winde their curling branches about them; which vines affoard great store of grapes, which are very big both for the grape and Cluster, sweet and good: These be of two sorts, red and white, there is likewise a smaller kind of grape, which groweth in the Islands which is sooner ripe and more delectable; so that there is no knowne reason why as good wine may not be made in those parts, as well as in <HI>Burdeuax</HI> in <HI>France</HI>; being under the same degree. It is great pit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ie no man sets upon such a venture, whereby he might in small time inrich himselfe, and benefit the Countrie, I know no|thing which doth hinder but want of skilfull men to manage such an imployment: For the countrey is hot enough, the ground good enough, and many convenient hills which lye toward the south Sunne, as if they were there placed for the purpose.

<P>Concerning Lyons, I will not say that I ever saw any my selfe, but some affirme that they have seene a Lyon at <HI>Cape Anne</HI> which is not above six leagues from <HI>Boston:</HI> some like|wise being lost in woods, have heard such terrible roarings, as have made them much agast; which must eyther be De|vills or Lyons; there being no other creatures which use to roare saving Beares, which have not such a terrible kind of roaring: besides, <HI>Plimouth</HI> men have traded for Lyons skinnes in former times. But sure it is that there be Lyons on that Continent, for the <HI>Virginians</HI> saw an old Lyon in their plantation, who having lost his Iackall, which was wont to hunt his prey, was brought so poore that he could goe no further. For Beares they be common, being a great blacke kind of Beare, which be most feirce in Strawberry time, at which time they have young ones; at this time like|wise they will goe upright like a man, and clime trees, and swimme to the Islands; which if the <HI>Indians</HI> see, there will be more sportfull Beare bayting than Paris Garden can af|foard. For seeing the Beares take water, an <HI>Indian</HI> will leape after him, where they goe to water cuffes for bloody
<PB N="20" REF="17">
noses, and scratched sides; in the end the man gets the victo|ry, riding the Beare over the watery plaine till he can beare him no longer. In the winter they take themselves to the clifts of rockes, and thicke swamps, to shelter them from the cold; and foode being scant in those cold and hard times, they live onely by sleeping and sucking their pawes, which keepeth them as fat as they are in Summer; there would be more of them if it were not for the Woolves, which de|voure them; a kennell of those ravening runnagadoes, set|ting on a poore single Beare, will teare him as a Dogge will teare a Kid: it would be a good change if the countrey had for every Woolfe a Beare, upon the condition all the woolves were banished; so should the inhabitants be not one|ly rid of their greatest annoyance, but furnished with more store of provisions, Beares being accounted very good meate, esteemed of all men above Venison&punc; againe they ne|ver prey upon the <HI>English</HI> cattle, or offer to assault the per|son of any man, unlesse being vexed with a shot, and a man run upon them before they be dead, in which case they will stand in their owne defence, as may appeare by this instance. Two men going a fowling, appointed at evening to meete at a certaine pond side, to share equally, and to returne home; one of these Gunners having killed a Seale or Sea calfe, brought it to the side of the pond where hee was to meete his comrade, afterwards returning to the Sea side for more gaine; and having loaded himselfe with more Geese and Duckes, he repaired to the pond, where hee saw a great Beare feeding on his Seale, which caused him to throw downe his loade, and give the Beare a salute; which though it was but with Goose shot, yet tumbled him over and over, whereupon the man supposing him to be in a man|ner dead, ran and beate him with the hand of his Gunne; The Beare perceiving him to be such a coward to strike him when he was down, scrambled up, standing at defiance with him, scratching his legges, tearing his cloathes and face, who stood it out till his six foot Gunne was broken in the middle, then being deprived of his weapon, he ran up to the shoulders into the pond, where hee remained till the
<PB N="21" REF="17">
Beare was gone, and his mate come in, who accompanied him home.</P>
<P>The beast called a Moose, is not much unlike red Deare, this beast is as bigge as an Oxe; slow of foote, headed like a Bucke, with a broade beame, some being two yards wide in the head, their flesh is as good as Beefe, their hides good for cloathing; The <HI>English</HI> have some thoughts of keeping them tame, and to accustome them to the yoake, which will be a great commoditie: First because they are so fruit|full, bringing forth three at a time, being likewise very ube|rous. Secondly, because they will live in winter without any fodder. There be not many of these in the <HI>Massachusets bay,</HI> but forty miles to the Northeast there be great store of them; These pore beasts likewise are much devoured by the Woolves: The ordinary Deare be much bigger than the Deare of <HI>England,</HI> of a brighter colour, more inclining to red, with spotted bellies; the most store of these be in win|ter, when the more Northerne parts of the countrey bee cold for them; they desire to be neare the Sea, so that they may swimme to the Islands when they are chased by the Woolves: It is not to be thought into what great multitudes they would encrease, were it not for the common devourer the Woolfe; They have generally three at a time, which they hide a mile one from another, giving them sucke by turnes; thus they doe, that if the Woolfe should finde one, he might misse of the other. These Deare be fat in the deepe of winter; In Summer it is hard catching of them with the best Greyhounds that may be procured, because they bee swift of foote. Some credible persons have affirmed, that they have seene a Deare leape three score feet at little or no forcement; besides, there be so many old trees, rotten stumps, and <HI>Indian</HI> barnes, that a dog cannot well run without being shoulder-shot: yet would I not disswade any from carrying good dogges; for in the winter time they be very usefull; for when the snow is hard frozen, the Deare being heavie, sinkes into the snow, the doggs being light runne upon the top and overtake them, and pull them downe: some by this meanes have gotten twenty Buckes and Does in a winter,
<PB N="22" REF="18">
the hornes of these Deare grow in such a straight manner, (overhanging their heads) that they cannot feede upon such things as grow low, till they have cast their old hornes: of these Deare there be a great many, and more in the <HI>Massa|chusets bay,</HI> than in any other place, which is a great helpe and refreshment to these planters. The Porcupine is a small thing not much unlike a Hedgehog; something big|ger, who stands upon his guard and proclaimes a <HI>Noli me tangere,</HI> to man and beast, that shall approach too neare him, darting his quills into their legges, and hides. The Rack<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">one is a deepe furred beast, not much unlike a Badger, having a tayle like a Fox, as good meate as a Lambe; there is one of them in the Tower. These beasts in the day time sleepe in hollow trees, in the moone shine night they goe to feede on clammes at a low tide, by the Sea side, where the <HI>English</HI> hunt them with their dogges. The Squerrells be of thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> sorts, first the great gray Squerrell, which is almost as bigge as an <HI>English</HI> Rabbet; of these there be the greatest plenty, one may kill a dozen of them in an afternoone, about three of the clocke they begin to walke. The second is a small Squerrell, not unlike the <HI>English</HI> Squerrell, which doth much trouble the planters of Corne, so that they are constrained to set di|vers Trappes, and to carry their Cats into the Corne fields, till their corne be three weekes old. The third kind is a fly|ing Squerrell, which is not very bigge, slender of body, with a great deale of loose skinne which shee spreads square when shee flyes, which the winde gets, and so wafts her Batlike body from place to place; it is a creature more for sight and wonderment, than eyther pleasure or profit. The Rabbets be much like ours in <HI>England.</HI> The Hares be some of them white, and a yard long; these two harmelesse crea|tures are glad to shelter themselves from the harmefull Foxes, in hollow trees, having a hole at the entrance no bigger than they can creepe in at: if they should make them holes in the ground, as on <HI>English</HI> Rabbets doe, the under|mining Renoilds would rob them of their lives, and extirpate their generation. The beasts of offence be Squunckes, Fer|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ets, Foxes, whose impudence sometimes drives them to the

good wives Hen roost, to fill their Paunch: some of these be blacke; their furre is of much esteeme.</P>
<P>The Ounce or the wilde Cat, is as big as a mungrell dog, this creature is by nature feirce, and more dangerous to bee met withall than any other creature, not fearing eyther dogge or man; he useth to kill Deare, which hee thus ef|fecteth: Knowing the Deares tracts, hee will lye lurking in long weedes, the Deare passing by he suddenly leapes upon his backe, from thence gets to his necke, and scratcheth out his throate; he hath likewise a devise to get Geese, for be|ing much of the colour of a Goose he will place himselfe close by the water, holding us his bob taile, which is like a Goose necke; the Geese seeing this counterfet Goose, ap|proach nigh to visit him, who with a suddaine jerke appre|hends his mistrustlesse prey. The <HI>English</HI> kill many of these, accounting them very good meate. Their skinnes be a very deepe kind of Furre, spotted white and black on the belly. The Woolves bee in some respect different from them of other countries; it was never knowne yet that a Woolfe e|ver set upon a man or woman. Neyther do they trouble hor|ses or cowes; but swine, goates and red calves which they take for Deare, be often destroyed by them, so that a red calfe is cheaper than a blacke one in that regard; in Au|tumne and the beginning of the Spring, these ravenous ran|gers doe most frequent our <HI>English</HI> habitations, following the Deare which come downe at that time to those parts. They be made much like a Mungrell, being big boned, la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ke paunched, deepe breasted, having a thicke necke, and head, pricke eares, and long snoute, with dangerous teeth, long staring haire, and a great bush taile; it is thought of many, that our <HI>English</HI> Mastiffes might be too hard for them; but it is no such matter, for they care no more for an ordinary Mastiffe, than an ordinary Mastiffe cares for a C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re; many good Dogges have beene spoyled with them. Once a faire Grayhound hearing them at their howlings run out to chide them, who was torne in peeces before he could be rescued. One of them makes no more bones to runne away with a Pigge, than a Dogge to runne away with a Marrow <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ne.
<PB N="24" REF="19">
it is observed that they have no joynts from the head to the tayle, which prevents them from leaping, or suddaine turn|ing, as may appeare by what I shall shew you. A certaine man having shot an Woolfe, as he was feeding upon a Swine, breaking his legge onely, hee knew not how to dev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">se his death, on a suddaine, the Woolfe being a blacke one, he was loath to spoyle his furre with a second shot, his skinne being worth five or sixe pound Sterling; wherefore hee resolved to get him by the tayle, and thrust him into a River that was hard by; which effected, the Woolfe being not able to turne his joyntlesse body to bite him, was taken. That they can|not leape, may appeare by this Woolfe, whose mouth wa|tering at a few poore impaled Kiddes, would needes leape o|ver a five-foote pale to be at them; but his foote slipping in the rise, he fell a little short of his desire, and being hung in the Carpenters stockes, howled so loud, that he frighted a|way the Kids, and called the <HI>English,</HI> who killed him. These be killed dayly in some place or other, either by the <HI>English,</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI>; who have a certaine rate for every head: Yet is there little hope of their utter destruction, the Countrey be|ing so spacious, and they so numerous, travelling in the Swamps by Kennels: sometimes ten or twelve are of a com|pany. Late at night, and early in the morning, they set up their howlings, and call their companies together at night to hunt, at morning to sleepe; in a word they be the greatest inconveniency the Countrey hath, both for matter of dam|mage to private men in particular, and the whole Countrey in generall.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Beasts living in the water.</HEAD>
<P>FOr all creatures that liv'd both by Land and Water, they be first Otters, which be most of them blacke, whose furre is much used for Muffes, and are held almost as deare as Beaver. The fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sh of them is none of the best meate, but
<PB N="25" REF="19">
their Oyle is of rare use for many things. Secondly, Martins, a good furre for their bignesse: Thirdly, Musquashes, which be much like a Beaver for shape, but nothing neare so bigge; the Male hath two stones which smell as sweete as Muske, and being killed in Winter, never lose their sweete smell: These skinnes are no bigger than a Coney-skinne, yet are sold for five shillings a peice, being sent for Tokens into <HI>Eng|land.</HI> One good skinne will perfume a whole house-full of cloathes, if it be right and good. Fourthly, the Beaver, con|cerning whom if I should at large discourse, according to knowledge or information, I might make a Volumne. The wisedome and understanding of this Beast, will almost con|clude him a reasonable creature: His shape is thicke and short, having likewise short legs, feete like a Mole before, and be|hinde like a Goo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, a broad tayle in forme like a shooe-soale, very tough and strong; his head is something like an Otters head, saving that his teeth before, be placed like the teeth of a Rabbet, two above, and two beneath; sharpe and broad, with which he cuts downe Trees as thicke as a mans thigh, afterwards diuiding them into lengths, according to the use they are appointed for. If one Bever be too weake to carry the logge, then another helpes him; if they two be too weake, then <HI>Multorum manibus grande levatur onus</HI>; foure more adding their helpe, being placed three to three, which set their teeth in one anothers tough tayles, and lay|ing the loade on the two hindermost, they draw the logge to the desired place. That this may not seeme altogether incre|dible, remember that the like almost may be seene in our Ants, which will joyne sometimes seaven or eight together in the carrying of a burthen. These Creatures build themselves houses of wood and clay, close by the Ponds sides, and know|ing the Seasons, build them answerable houses, having them three stories high, so that as land-floods are raised by great Raines, as the waters arise, they mount higher in their houses; as they asswage, they descend lower againe. These houses are so strong, that no creature saving an industrious man with his penetrating tooles can prejudice them, their in|gresse and egresse being vnder water. These make likewise
<PB N="26" REF="20">
very good Ponds, knowing whence a streame runnes from betweene two rising Hils, they will there pitch downe piles of Wood, placing smaller rubbish before it with clay and sods, not leaving, till by their Art and Industry they have made a firme and curious damme-head, which may draw admiration from wise understanding men. These creatures keepe themselves to their owne families, never parting so long as they are able to keepe house together: And it is com|monly sayd, if any Beaver accidentally light into a strange place, he is made a drudge so long as he lives there, to carry at the greater end of the logge, unlesse he creepe away by stealth. Their wisedome secures them from the <HI>English,</HI> who seldome, or neuer kills any of them, being not patient to lay a long siege, or to be so often deceived by their cunning eva|sions, so that all the Beaver which the <HI>English</HI> have, comes first from the <HI>Indians,</HI> whose time and experience fits them for that imployment.</P>

The Humbird is one of the wonders of the Countrey, being no bigger than a Hornet, yet hath all the demensions of a Bird, as bill, and wings, with quills, spider-like legges, small clawes: For colour, she is as glorious as the Rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e-bow; as she flies, she makes a little humming noise like a Humble-bee: wherefore shee is called the Humbird. The Pigeon of that Countrey, is something different from our Dove-house Pige|ons in <HI>England,</HI> being more like Turtles, of the same colour; but they haue long tayles like a Magpie: And they seeme not so bigge, because they carry not so many feathers on their backes as our <HI>English</HI> Doves, yet are they as bigge in body. These Birds come into the Countrey, to goe to the North parts in the beginning of our Spring, at which time (if I may be counted worthy, to be beleeved in a thing that is not so strange as true) I have seene them fly as if the Ayerie re|giment had beene Pigeons; seeing neyther beginning nor en|ding, length, or breadth of these Millions of Millions. The shouting of people, the ratling of Gunnes, and pelting of small shotte could not drive them out of their course, but so they continued for foure or five houres together: yet it must not be concluded, that it is thus often; for it is but at the be|ginning of the Spring, and at <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> when they returne backe to the Southward; yet are there some all the yeare long, which are easily attayned by such as looke after them. Ma|ny of them build amongst the Pine-trees, thirty miles to the North-east of our plantations; joyning nest to nest, and tree to tree by their nests, so that the Sunne never sees the ground in that place, from whence the <HI>Indians</HI> fetch whole loades of them.</P>
<P>The Turky is a very large Bird, of a blacke colour, yet white in flesh; much bigger than our <HI>English</HI> Turky. He hath the use of his long legs so ready, that he can runne as fast as a

Dogge, and flye as well as a Goose: of these sometimes there will be forty, threescore, and a hundred of a flocke, some|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mes more and sometimes lesse; their feeding is Acornes, Hawes, and Berries, some of them get a haunt to frequent our <HI>English</HI> corne: In winter when the Snow covers the ground, they resort to the Sea shore to look for Shrimps, &amp; such smal Fishes at low tide. Such as love Turkie hunting, must follow it in winter after a new falne Snow, when hee may follow them by their tracts; some have killed ten or a dozen in halfe a day; if they can be found towards an evening and watched where they peirch, if one come about ten or eleaven of the clocke he may shoote as often as he will, they will sit, unlesse they be slenderly wounded. These Turkies remaine all the yeare long, the price of a good Turkie cocke is foure shillings; and he is well worth it, for he may be in weight forty pound; a Hen two shillings. Pheasons bee very rare, but Heathcockes, and Partridges be common; he that is a husband, and will be stirring betime, may kill halfe a dozen in a morning.</P>
<P>The Partridges be bigger than they be in <HI>England,</HI> the flesh of the Heathcockes is red, and the flesh of a Partridge white, their price is foure pence a peece. The Ravens, and the Crowes be much like them of other countries. There are no Magpies, Iackedawes, Coockooes, Iayes, Sparrows, &amp;c. The Stares be bigger than those in <HI>England,</HI> as blacke as Crowes, being the most troublesome, and injurious bird of all others, pulling up the cornes by the roots, when it is young, so that those who plant by reedy and seggy places, where they frequent, are much annoyed with them, they being so audacious that they feare not Guns, or their fel|lowes hung upon poles; but the Corne having a weeke or nine dayes growth is past their spoyling. The Owles be of two sorts; the one being small speckled, like a Partridge, with ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, the other being a great Owle, almost as big as an Eagle, his body beeing as good meate as a Partridge. Cor|morants bee as common as other fowles, which destroy abundance of small fish, these are not worth the shooting because they are the worst of fowles for meate, tasting
<PB N="30" REF="22">
ranke, and fishy: againe, one may shoot twenty times and misse, for seeing the fire in the panne, they dive under the water before the shot comes to the place where they were; they use to roost upon the tops of trees, and rockes, being a very heavy drowsie creature, so that the <HI>Indians</HI> will goe in their Cannowes in the night, and take them from the Rockes, as easily as women take a Hen from roost; No ducking ponds can affoard more delight than a lame Cor|morant, and two or three lusty Dogges. The Crane al|though hee bee almost as tall as a man by reason of his long legges, and necke; yet is his body rounder than other fowles, not much unlike the body of a Turkie. I have seene many of these fowles, yet did I never see one that was far, I suppose it is contrary to their nature to grow fat&punc; Of these there be many in Summer, but none in winter, their price is two shilling. There be likewise many Swannes which frequent the fresh ponds and rivers, seldome consorting themselves with Duckes and Geese; these bee very good meate, the price of one is six shillings. The Geese of the countrey be of three sorts, first a brant Goose, which is a Goose almost like the wilde Goose in <HI>England,</HI> the price of one of these is six pence. The second kind is a white Goose, almost as big as an <HI>English</HI> tame Goose, these come in great flockes about Michelmasse, sometimes there will be two or three thousand in a flocke, these continue six weekes, and so flye to the southward, returning in March, and staying six weekes more, returning againe to the North|ward; the price of one of these is eight pence. The third kind of Geese, is a great gray Goose, with a blacke necke, and a blacke and white head, strong of flight; these bee a great deale bigger than the ordinary Geese of <HI>England,</HI> some very fat, and in the Spring so full of Feathers, that the shot can scarce peirce them; most of these Geese remaine with us from Michelmas to Aprill; they feede on the Sea of Fish, and in the woods of Acornes, having as other Foule have, their passe and repasse to the Northward and Southward: the accurate marksmen kill of these both flying and sitting; the price of a good gray Goose is eighteene pence. The
<PB N="31" REF="22">
Duckes of the countrey be very large ones and in great a|bundance, so is there of Teale likewise; the price of a Ducke is six pence, of a Teale three pence. If I should tell you how some have killed a hundred Geese in a weeke, 50. Duckes at a shot, 40. Teales at another, it may be counted impossible, though nothing more certaine. The Oldwives, be a foule that never leave tatling day or night, something bigger than a Ducke. The Loone is an ill shap'd thing like a Cormorant; but that he can neyther goe nor flye; he maketh a noise sometimes like a Sowgelders horne. The Humilities or Simplicities (as I may rather call them) bee of two sorts, the biggest being as big as a greene Plover, the other as big as birds we call knots in <HI>England.</HI> Such is the simplicity of the smaller sorts of these birds, that one may drive them on a heape like so many sheepe, and seeing a fit time shoot them; the living seeing the dead, settle themselves on the same place againe, amongst which the Fowler discharges a|gaine. I my selfe have killed twelve score at two shootes: these bird are to be had upon sandy brakes at the latter end of Summer before the Geese come in. Thus much have I shewed you as I know to bee true concerning the Fowle of the countrey. But me thinkes I heare some say that this is very good if it could be caught, or likely to continue, and that much shooting will fright away the fowles. True it is, that every ones imployment wil not permit him to fowle: what then? yet those imployments furnish them with silver Guns with which they may have it more easie. For the frighting of the fowle, true it is that many goe blurting away their pouder and shot, that have no more skill to kill, or winne a Goose, than many in <HI>England</HI> that have rustie Muskets in their houses, knowes what belongs to a Souldier, yet are they not much affrighted.

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of Fish.</HEAD>
<P>HHving done with these, let me leade you from the land to the Sea, to view what commodities may come from thence; there is no countrey knowne, that yeelds more variety of fish winter and summer: and that not onely for the present spending and sustentation of the plantations, but likewise for trade into other countries, so that those which have had stages &amp; make fishing voyages into those parts, have gained (it is thought) more than the new found land Iobbers. Codfish in these seas are larger than in new found land, six or seaven making a quintall, whereas there they have fif|teene to the same weight; and though this they seeme a base and more contemptible commoditie in the judgement of more neate adventurers, yet it hath bin the enrichment of other nations, and and is likely to prove no small commodi|tie to the planters, and likewise to <HI>England</HI> if it were tho|rowly undertaken. Salt may be had from the salt Islands, and as is supposed may be made in the countrey. The chiefe fish for trade is Cod, but for the use of the countrey, there is all manner of fish as followeth.</P>

<P>To omit such of these as are not usefull, therefore not to be spoken of, and onely to certifie you of such as be usefull. First the Seale which is that which is called the Sea Calfe, his skinne is good for divers uses, his body being betweene fish and flesh, it is not very delectable to the pallate, or con|gruent with the stomack; his Oyle is very good to burne in Lampes, of which he affoards a great deale. The Sharke is a kinde of fish as bigge as a man, some as bigge as a horse, with three rowes of teeth within his mouth, with which he snaps asunder the fishermans lines, if he be not very cir|cumspect: This fish will leape at a mans hand if it be over board, and with his teeth snap off a mans legge or hand if he be a swimming; These are often taken, being good for nothing but to put on the ground for manuring of land. The Sturgions be all over the countrey, but the best catching of them be upon the shoales of <HI>Cape Codde,</HI> and in the River of <HI>Mirrimacke,</HI> where much is taken, pickled and brought for <HI>England,</HI> some of these be 12.14.18. foote long: I set not downe the price of fish there, because it is so cheape, so that one may have as much for two pence, as would give him an angell in <HI>England.</HI> The Sammon is as good as it is in <HI>Eng|land</HI> and in great plenty. The Hollibut is not much unlike a pleace or Turbut, some being two yards long, and one wide: and a foot thicke; the plenty of better fish makes these of little esteeme, except the head and finnes, which stewed or
<PB N="34" REF="24">
baked is very good: these Hollibuts be little set by while Basse is in season. Thornebacke and Scates is given to the dogges, being not counted worth the dressing in many pla|ces. The Basse is one of the best fishes in the countrey, and though men are soone wearied with other fish, yet are they never with Basse; it is a delicate, fine, fat, fast fish, having a bone in his head, which containes a sawcerfull of marrow sweet and good, pleasant to the pallat, and wholsome to the stomack. When there be great store of them, we onely eate the heads, and salt up the bodies for winter, which ex|ceedes Ling or Haberdine. Of these fishes some be three and some foure foot long, some bigger, some lesser: at some tides a man may catch a dozen or twenty of these in three houres, the way to catch them is with hooke and line: The Fisherman taking a great Cod-line, to which he fastneth a peece of Lobster, and throwes it into the Sea, the fish bi|ting at it he pulls her to him, and knockes her on the head with a sticke. These are at one time (when Alewives passe up the Rivers) to be catched in Rivers, in Lobster time at the Rockes, in Macrill time in the Bayes, at Michelmas in the Seas. When they use to tide it in and out to the Ri|vers and Creekes, the <HI>English</HI> at the top of an high water do crosse the Creekes with long scanes or Basse Netts, which stop in the fish; and the water ebbing from them they are left on the dry ground, sometimes two or three thou|sand at a set, which are salted up against winter, or distribu|ted to such as have present occasion either to spend them in their houses, or use them for their ground. The Herrings be much like them that be caught on the <HI>English</HI> coasts. Alewives be a kind of fish which is much like a Herring, which in the latter end of Aprill come up to the fresh Ri|vers to spawne, in such multitudes as is allmost incredible, pressing up in such shallow waters as will scarce permit them to swimme, having likewise such longing desire after the fresh water ponds, that no beatings with poles, or for|cive agitations by other devices, will cause them to returne to the sea, till they have cast their Spawne. The Shaddes be bigger than the <HI>English</HI> Shaddes and fatter. The Macrells be
<PB N="35" REF="24">
of two sorts, in the beginning of the yeare are great ones, which be upon the coast; some are 18. inches long. In Summer as in May, Iune, Iuly, and August, come in a smaller kind of them: These Macrills are taken with drailes which is a long small line, with a lead and hooke at the end of it, being bai|ted with a peece of red cloath: this kind of fish is counted a leane fish in <HI>England,</HI> but there it is so fat, that it can scarce be saved against winter without reisting. There be a great store of Salt water Eeles, especially in such places where grasse growes: for to take these there be certaine Eele pots made of Osyers, which must be baited with a peece of Lobster, into which the Eeles entring cannot returne backe againe: some take a bushell in a night in this manner, eating as many as they have neede of for the present, and salt up the rest against winter. These Eeles be not of so luscious a tast as they be in <HI>England,</HI> neyther are they so aguish, but are both whole|some for the body, and delightfull for the taste: Lamprons and Lampreyes be not much set by; Lobsters be in plenty in most places, very large ones, some being 20. pound in weight; these are taken at a low water amongst the rockes, they are very good fish, the small ones being the best, their plenty makes them little esteemed and seldome eaten. The <HI>Indians</HI> get many of them every day for to baite their hookes withall, and to eate when they can get no Basse: The Oi|sters be great ones in forme of a shoo horne, some be a foote long, these breede on certaine bankes that are bare every spring tide. This fish without the shell is so big that it must admit of a devision before you can well get it into your mouth. The Perewig is a kind of fish that lyeth in the oaze like a head of haire, which being touched con|veyes it selfe leaving nothing to bee seene but a small round hole. Muscles be in great plenty, left onely for the Hogges, which if they were in <HI>England</HI> would be more esteemed of the poorer sort. Clamms or Clamps is a shel-fish not much unlike a cockle, it lyeth under the sand, every six or seaven of them having a round hole to take ayre and receive water at. When the tide ebs and flowes, a man running over these Clamm bankes will presently be made all wet, by their spou|ting
<PB N="36" REF="25">
of water out of those small holes: These fishes be in great plenty in most places of the countrey, which is a great commoditie for the feeding of Swine, both in winter, and Summer; for being once used to those places, they will re|paire to them as duely every ebbe, as if they were driven to them by keepers: In some places of the countrey there bee Clamms as bigge as a pennie white loafe, which are great dainties amongst the natives, and would bee in good esteeme amongst the <HI>English,</HI> were it not for better fish.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of the severall plantations in particular.</HEAD>
<P>HAving described the situation of the countrey in gene|rall, with all his commodities arising from land and Sea, it may adde to your content and satisfaction to be infor|med of the situation of every severall plantation, with his conveniences, commodities, and discommodities, &amp;c. where first I will begin with the outmost plantation in the patent to the South ward,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Wessagustus</HI></NOTE> which is called <HI>Wessagutus</HI> an <HI>Indian</HI> name: this as yet is but a small Village, yet it is very plea|sant, and healthfull, very good ground, and is well timbred, and hath good store of Hey ground; it hath a very spacious harbour for shipping before the towne; the salt water being navigable for Boates &amp; Pinnaces two leagues. Here the inha|bitants have good store of fish of all sorts, and Swine, having Acornes and Clamms at the time of yeare; here is like|wise an Alewife river. Three miles to the North of this is mount <HI>Walleston,</HI> a very fertile soyle, and a place very con|venient for Farmers houses, there being great store of plaine ground, without trees. This place is called <HI>Massachusets fields</HI> where the greatest <HI>Sagamore</HI> in the countrey lived, before the Plague, who caused it to be cleared for himselfe. The greatest inconvenience is, that there is not very many Springs, as in other places of the countrey, yet water may bee had for digging: A second inconvenience is, that Boates cannot
<PB N="37" REF="25">
come in at a low water, nor ships ride neare the shore. Sixe miles further to the North, lieth <HI>Dorchester</HI>;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dorchester.</HI></NOTE> which is the greatest Towne in <HI>New England</HI>; well woodded and wa|tered; very good arable grounds, and Hay-ground, faire Corne-fields, and pleasan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Gardens, with Kitchin-gardens. In this plantation is a great many Cattle, as Kine, Goats, and Swine. This plantation hath a reasonable Harbour for ships: Here is no Alewife-river, which is a great inconvenience. The inhabitants of this towne, were the first that set upon the trade of fishing in the Bay, who received so much fruite of their labours, that they encouraged others to the same under|takings. A mile from this Towne lieth <HI>Roxberry,</HI> which is a faire and handsome Countrey-towne;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Roxberry.</HI></NOTE> the inhabitants of it being all very rich. This Towne lieth upon the Maine, so that it is well woodded and watered; having a cleare and fresh Brooke running through the Towne: Vp which although there come no Alewiues, yet there is great store of Smelts, and therefore it is called Smelt-brooke.</P>
<P>A quarter of a mile to the North-side of the Towne, is ano|ther River called <HI>Stony-river</HI>; upon which is built a water-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ne. Here is good ground for Corne, and Medow for Cat|tle: Vp westward from the Towne it is something rocky, whence it hath the name of <HI>Roxberry</HI>; the inhabitants have faire houses, store of Cattle, impaled Corne-fields, and fruitfull Gardens. Here is no Harbour for ships, because the Towne is seated in the bottome of a shallow Bay, which is made by the necke of land on which <HI>Boston</HI> is built; so that they can transport all their goods from the Ships in Boats from <HI>Boston,</HI> which is the nearest Harbour.</P>
<P><HI>Boston</HI> is two miles North-east from <HI>Roxberry</HI>: His situati|on is very pleasant, being a <HI>Peninsula,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Boston.</HI></NOTE> hem'd in on the South-side with the Bay of <HI>Roxberry,</HI> on the North-side with <HI>Gla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly-river,</HI> the Marshes on the backe-side, being not halfe a quarter of a mile over; so that a little fencing will secure their Cattle from the Woolues. Their greatest wants be Wood, and Medow-ground, which never were in that place; being constrayned to fetch their building-timber, and fire-wood from the Ilands in Boates, and their Hay in Loyters: It being
<PB N="38" REF="26">
a necke and bare of wood: they are not troubled with three great annoyances, of Woolves, Rattle-snakes, and Muske|toes. These that live here upon their Cattle, must be con|strayned to take Farmes in the Countrey, or else they can|not subsist; the place being too small to containe many, and fittest for such as can Trade into <HI>England,</HI> for such com|modities as the Countrey wants, being the chiefe place for shipping and Merchandize.</P>
<P>This <HI>Necke of land</HI> is not above foure miles in compasse, in forme almost squ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re, having on the South-side at one corner, a great broad hill, whereon is planted a Fort, which can com|mand any ship as shee say<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es into any Harbour within the still Bay. On the North-side is another Hill, equall in bignesse, whereon stands a Winde-mill. To the North-west is a high Mountaine with three little rising Hils on the top of it, where|fore it is called the <HI>Tramount.</HI> From the top of this Moun|taine a man may over-looke all the Ilands which lie before the Bay, and discry such ships as are upon the Sea-coast. This Towne although it be neither the greatest, nor the richest, yet it is the most noted and fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quented, being the Center of the Plantations where the monthly Courts are kept.

The inhabitants of this place for their enlargement, have taken to themselves Farme-houses, in a place called <HI>Muddy-river,</HI> two miles from their Towne; where is good ground, large timber, and store of Marsh-land, and Medow. In this place they keepe their Swine and other Cattle in the Summer, whilst the Corne is on the ground at <HI>Boston,</HI> and bring them to the Towne in Winter.</P>
<P>On the North-side of <HI>Charles River</HI> is <HI>Charles Towne,</HI> which is another necke of Land,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Charles-Towne.</HI></NOTE> on whose North-side runs <HI>Misticke-river.</HI> This Towne for all things, may be well pa|ralel'd with her neighbour <HI>Boston,</HI> being in the same fashion with her bare necke, and constrained to borrow convenien|ces from the Maine, and to provide for themselves Farmes in the Countrey for their better subsistance. At this Towne
<PB N="39" REF="26">
there is kept a Ferry-boate, to conveigh passengers over <HI>Charles River,</HI> which betweene the two Townes is a quar|ter of a mile over, being a very deepe Channell. Here may ride forty ships at a time. Vp higher it is a broad Bay, being above two miles betweene the shores, into which runnes <HI>Sto|ny-river,</HI> and <HI>Muddy-river.</HI> Towards the South-west in the middle of this Bay, is a great Oyster-banke: Towards the North-west of this Bay is a great Creeke, upon whose shore is situated the Village of <HI>Medford,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Medford.</HI></NOTE> a very fertile and plea|sant place, and fit for more inhabitants than are yet in it. This Towne is a mile and a halfe from <HI>Charles Towne,</HI> and at the bottome of this Bay the River beginnes to be narrower, being but halfe a quarter of a mile broad.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>New-towne.</HI></NOTE> By the side of this River is built <HI>New-towne,</HI> which is three miles by land from <HI>Charles Towne,</HI> and a league and a halfe by water. This place was first intended for a City, but upon more serious considerati|ons it was not thought so fit, being too farre from the Sea; be|ing the greatest inconvenience it hath. This is one of the nea|rest and best compacted Townes in <HI>New England,</HI> having many faire structures, with many handsome contrived streets. The inhabitants most of them are very rich, and well stored with Cattell of all sorts; having many hundred Acres of ground paled in with one generall fence, which is about a mile and a halfe long, which secures all their weaker Cattle from the wilde beasts. On the other side of the River lieth all their Medow and Marsh-ground for Hay.</P>
<P>Halfe a mile Westward of this plantation, is <HI>Water-towne</HI>; a place nothing inferiour for land, wood, medow, and water to <HI>New-towne.</HI> Within halfe a mile of this Towne is a great Pond, which is divided betweene those two Townes, which divides their bounds Northward. A mile and a halfe from this Towne, is a fall of fresh waters, which conveigh them|selves into the Ocean through <HI>Charles River.</HI> A little below this fall of waters, the inhabitants of <HI>Water-towne</HI> have built a Wayre to catch Fish,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Water-towne.</HI></NOTE> wherein they take great store of <HI>Shads</HI> and <HI>Alewives.</HI> In two Tydes they have gotten one hundred thousand of those Fishes: This is no small benefit to the plan|tation: Ships of small burden may come up to these two

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Misticke.</HI></NOTE>The next Towne is <HI>Misticke,</HI> which is three miles from <HI>Charles Towne</HI> by land, and a league and a halfe by water: It is seated by the waters side very pleasantly; there be not ma|ny houses as yet. At the head of this River are great and spa|cious Ponds, whither the <HI>Alewives</HI> preasse to spawne. This being a noted place for that kinde of Fish, the <HI>English</HI> resort thither to take them. On the West side of this River the Go|vernour hath a Farme, where he keepes most of his Cattle. On the East side is Maister <HI>Craddockes</HI> plantation, where he hath impaled a Parke, where he keepes his Cattle, till he can store it with Deere: Here likewise he is at charges of building ships. The last yeare one was upon the Stockes of a hundred Tunne, that being finished, they are to build one twice her burden. Ships without either Ballast or loading, may floate downe this River; otherwise the Oyster-banke would hinder them which crosseth the Channell.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Winnisimet.</HI></NOTE>The last Towne in the still Bay, is <HI>Winnisimet</HI>; a very sweet place for situation, and stands very commodiously, being fit to entertaine more planters than are yet seated:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ilands there</HI></NOTE> it is within a mile of <HI>Charles Towne,</HI> the River onely parting them. The chiefe Ilands which keepe out the Winde and the Sea from disturbing the Harbours, are first <HI>Deare Iland,</HI> which lies wirhin a flight-shot of <HI>Pullin-point.</HI> This Iland is so called, because of the Deare which often swimme thither from the Maine, when they are chased by the Woolves: Some have kil|led sixteene Deere in a day upon this Iland. The opposite shore is called <HI>Pullin-point,</HI> because that is the usuall Channel. Boats use to passe thorow into the Bay; and the Tyde being very strong, they are constrayned to goe ashore, and hale their Boats by the sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing, or roades, whereupon it was cal|led <HI>Pullin-point.</HI></P>
<P>The next Iland of note is <HI>Long Iland,</HI> so called from his longitude. Divers other Ilands be within these: <HI>viz. Nodles Ile, Round Ile,</HI> the Governours Garden, where is planted an Orchard and a Vine-yard, with many other conveniences; and <HI>Slate-Iland, Glasse-Iland, Bird-Iland, &amp;c.</HI> These Iles
<PB N="41" REF="27">
bound with Woods, and Water, and Medow-ground; and whatsoever the spacious fertile Maine affords. The inhabi|tants use to put their Cattle in these for safety, <HI>viz.</HI> their Rammes, Goates, and Swine, when their Corne is on the ground. Those Townes that lie without the Bay, are a great deale nearer the Maine, and reape a greater benefit from the Sea, in regard of the plenty both of Fish and Fowle, which they receive from thence: so that they liue more comfortably, and at lesse charges, than those that are more remote from the Sea in the Land-plantations.</P>
<P>The next plantation is <HI>Saugus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Saugus.</HI></NOTE> sixe miles North-east from <HI>Winnesimet</HI>: This Towne is pleasant for situation, seated at the bottome of a Bay, which is made on the one side with the surrounding shore, and on the other side with a long san|dy Beach. This sandy Beach is two miles long at the end, whereon is a necke of land called <HI>Nahant:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nahant.</HI></NOTE> It is sixe miles in circumference; well woodded with Oakes, Pines, and Cedars: It is beside well watered, having beside the fresh Springs, a great Pond in the middle; before which is a spacious Marsh. In this necke is store of good ground, fit for the Plow; but for the present it is onely used for to put young Cattle in, and weather-goates, and Swine, to secure them from the Woolues: a few posts and rayles from the low water-markes to the shore, keepes out the Woolves, and keepes in the Cat|tle. One <HI>Blacke William,</HI> an <HI>Indian</HI> Duke, out of his gene|rosity gave this place in generall to this plantation of <HI>Saugus,</HI> so that no other can appropriate it to himselfe.</P>
<P>Vpon the South-side of the sandy Beach the Sea beateth, which is a true prognostication, to presage stormes and foule weather, and the breaking up of the Frost: For when a storme hath beene, or is likely to be, it will roare like Thun|der, being heard sixe miles; and after stormes casts up great store of great Clammes, which the <HI>Indians</HI> taking out of their shels, carry home in baskets. On the North-side of this Bay is two great Marshes, which are made two by a pleasant River which runnes betweene them. Northward up this Ri|ver, goes great store of Alewives, of which they make good Red Herrings; in so much that they have beene at charges to
<PB N="42" REF="28">
make a wayre, and a Herringhouse, to dry these Herrings in; the last yeare were dryed some 4 or 5 Last for an experiment, which proved very good; this is like to prove a great inrich|ment to the land, (being a staple commoditie in other Coun|tries) for there be such innumerable companies in every ri|ver, that I have seene ten thousand taken in two houres by two men, without any weire at all, saving a few stones to stone their passage up the river. There likewise come sto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of Basse, which the <HI>Indians</HI> and <HI>English</HI> catch with hooke and line, some fifty or threescore at a tide. At the mouth of this river runnes up a great creeke into that great Marsh, which is called <HI>Rumny</HI> Marsh, which is 4 miles long and a miles broad; halfe of it being Marsh ground and halfe upland grasse, without tree or bush: this Marsh is crossed with di|vers creekes, wherein lye great store of Geese, and Duckes. There be convenient lands for the planting of Duckcoyes. Here is likewise belonging to this place divers fresh med|dowes, which afford good grasse and foure spacious ponds like little lakes, wherein is store of fresh fish: within a mile of the towne, out of which runnes a curious fresh brooke that is seldome frozen by reason of the warmenesse of the water; upon this streame is built a water Milne, and up this river comes Smelts and frost fish much bigger than a Gud|gion. For wood there is no want, there being store of good Oakes, Wallnut, Caedar, Aspe, Elme; The ground is very good, in many places without trees, fit for the plough. In this plantation is more <HI>English</HI> tillage, than in all new <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI> besides; which proved as well as could bee expected, the corne being very good especially the Barly, Rye, and Oates.</P>
<P>The land affordeth the inhabitants as many ratities as any place else, and the sea more: the Basse continuing from the middle of Aprill to <HI>Michaelmas,</HI> which stayes not above half that time in the Bay: besides here is a great deale of Rock|cod and Macrill, insomuch that shoales of Basse have driven up shoales of Macrill from one end of the sandie brech to the other, which the inhabitants have gathered up in wheel|barrowes. The Bay that lyeth before the Towne at a low
<PB N="43" REF="28">
spring tyde, will be all flatts for two miles together, upon which is great store of Muscle banckes, and Clam bancks, and Lobsters amongst the rockes and grassie holes. These flatts make it unnavigable for shippes, yet at high water great Boates, Loiters, and Pinnaces of 20, and 30 tun, may saile up to the plantation, but they neede have a skilfull Pilote, because of many dangerous rockes and foaming breakers, that lye at the mouth of that Bay. The very aspect of the place is fortification enough to keepe off an unknowne ene|mie, yet may it be fortified at a little charge, being but few landing places there about, and those obscure. Foure miles Northeast from <HI>Sangus</HI> lyeth <HI>Salem,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Salem.</HI></NOTE> which stands on the middle of a necke of land very pleasantly, having a South ri|ver on the one side, and a North river on the other side: up|on this necke where the most of the houses stand is very bad and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndie ground, yet for seaven yeares together it hath brought forth exceeding good corne, by being fished but e|very third yeare; in some places is very good ground, and very good timber, and divers springs hard by the sea side. Here likewise is store of fish, as Basses, Eeles, Lobsters, Clammes, &amp;c. Although their land be none of the best, yet beyond those rivers is a very good soyle, where they have taken farmes, and get their Hay, and plant their corne; there they crosse these rivers with small Cannowes, which are made of whole pine trees, being about two foot &amp; a half over, and 20. foote long: in these likewise they goe a fowling, sometimes two leagues to sea; there be more Cannowes in this towne than in all the whole Patent; every houshould having a water-house or two. This Towne wants an Alewife river, which is a great inconvenience; it hath two good har|bours, the one being called Winter, and the other Summer harbour, which lyeth within <HI>Derbies</HI> Fort, which place if it were well fortified, might keepe shippes from landing of forces in any of those two places. <HI>Marvill Head</HI> is a place which lyeth 4 miles full South from <HI>Salem,</HI> and is a very convenient place for a plantation, especially for such as will set upon the trade of fishing.

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. Of the evills, and such things as are hurtfull in the Plantation.</HEAD>
<P>I have informed you of the Country in generall and of eve|ry plantation in particular, with their commodities and wherein one excelleth another. Now that I may be every way faithfull to my reader in this worke, I will as fully and truely relate to you what is evill, and of most annoyance to the inhabitants. First those which bring most prejudice to their estates are the ravenons Woolves, which destroy the weaker Cattell, but of these you have heard before: that which is most injurious to the person and life of man is a rattle snake which is generally a yard and a halfe long, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> thicke in the middle as the small of a mans legge, she hath a yellow belly, her backe being spotted with blacke, russet,
<PB N="45" REF="29">
yellow, and greene colours, placed like scales; at her taile is a rattle, with which she makes a noyse when she is molested, or when she seeth any approach neere her, her necke seemes to be no thicker than a mans thumbe yet can she swallow a Squerill, having a great wide mouth, with teeth as sharpe as needles, wherewith she biteth such as tread upon her: her poyson lyeth in her teeth, for she hath no sting. When any man is bitten by any of these creatures, the poyson spreads so suddenly through the veines &amp; so runs to the heart, that in one houre it causeth death, unlesse he hath the Antidote to expell the poyson, which is a root called snakeweed, which must be champed, the spittle swallowed, and the root applyed to the sore; this is present cure against that which would be present death without it: this weed is ranck poyson, if it be taken by any man that is not bitten: whosoever is bitte~ by these snakes his flesh becomes as spotted as a Leaper untill hee be per|fectly cured. It is reported that if the party live that is bit|ten, the snake will dye, and if the partie die, the snake will live. This is a most poysonous and dangerous creature, yet nothing so bad as the report goes of him in <HI>England.</HI> For whereas he is sayd to kill a man with his breath, and that he can flye, there is no such matter, for he is naturally the most sleepie and unnimble creature that lives, never offering to leape or bite any man, if he be not troden on first, and it is their desire in hot weather to lye in pathes, where the sunne may shine on them, where they will sleepe so soundy that I have knowne foure men stride over one of them, and never awake her: 5 or 6 men have beene bitten by them, which by using of snakeweede were all cured, never any yet losing his life by them. Cowes have beene bitten, but being cut in divers places, and this weede thrust into their flesh were cu|red, I never heard of any beast that was yet lost by any of them, saving one Mare. A small switch will easily kill one of these snakes. In many places of the Countrie there bee none of them, as at <HI>Plimouth, Newtowne, Igowamme, Nahant, &amp;c.</HI> In some places they will live on one side of the river, and swimming but over the water, as soone as they be come into the woods, they turne up their yellow bellies and dye. Vp
<PB N="46" REF="30">
into the Countrey westward from the plantations is a high hill, which is called rattlesnake hill, where there is great store of these poysonous creatures. There be divers other kinde of snakes, one whereof is a great long blacke snake, two yards in length which will glide through the woods ve|ry swiftly; these never doe any hurt, neither doth any other kinde of snakes molest either man or beast. These creatures in the winter time creepe into clifts of rockes and into holes under ground, where they lyd close till May or Iune. Here likewise bee great store of frogs, which in the Spring doe chirpe and whistle like a bird, and at the latter end of sum|mer croake like our English frogges. Heere be also toades which will climbe the topes of high trees where they will sit croaking, to the wonderment of such as are not acquain|ted with them. I never saw any Wormes or Moles, but pismires and spiders be there. There are likewise trou|blesome flies. First there is a wilde Bee or Waspe, which commonly guards the grape, building by cobweb habitation amongst the leaves: secondly a great greene flye, not much unlike our horse flyes in <HI>England</HI>; they will nippe so sore that they wil fetch blood either of man or beast, and be most troublesome where most Cattle be, which brings them from out of the woods to the houses; this flye continues but for the Moneth of Iune. The third is Gurnipper which is a small blacke fly no bigger than a flea; her biting causeth an itching upon the hands or face, which provoketh scratching which is troublesome to some; this fly is busie but in close mornings or evenings, and continues not above three weekes, the least winde or heate expells them. The fourth is a Musketor which is not unlike to our gnats in <HI>England</HI>; In places where there is no thicke woods or Swampes, there is none or very few. In new Plantations they be troublesome for the first yeare, but the wood dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ying they vanish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> these Flies cannot endure winde, heate or cold, so that these are onely troublesome in close thicke weather, and against raine many that be bitten will fall a scratching, whereupon their faces and hands swell. Others are never troubled with them at all: those likewise that swell with their biting the
<PB N="47" REF="30">
first yere, never swell the second: for my owne part I have bin troubled as much with them or some like them, in the coun|try of <HI>England</HI> as ever I was there: Here be the flies that are called C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">antharides, so much esteemed of Chirurgions, with divers kinds of Butterflies. Thus have you heard of the worst of the countrey: but some peradventure may say no, and reply that they have heard that the people have beene often driven to great wants and extremities; To which I answer, it is true that some have lived for a certaine time with a little bread, other without any, yet all this argues nothing against the countrey in it selfe, but condemnes the folly and improvidence of such as would venture into so rude and unmanaged a countrey, without so much provisions as should have comfortably maintained them in health and strength till by their labours they had brought the land to yeeld his fruite. I have my selfe heard some say that they heard it was a rich land, a brave country, but when they came there they could see nothing but a few Canvis Boothes &amp; old houses, supposing at the first to have found walled townes, fortifications and corne fields, as if townes could have built themselves, or corne fields have growne of them|selves, without the husbandrie of man. These men missing of their expectations, returned home and railed against the Country. Others may object that of late time there hath beene great want; I denie it not, but looke to the originall, and tell me from whence it came. The roote of their want sprung up in <HI>England,</HI> for many hundreds hearing of the plenty of the Country, were so much their owne foes and Countries hindrance, as to come without provision; which made things both deare and scant: wherefore let none blame the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntry so much as condemne the indiscreetnesse of such as will needs runne themselves upon hardship. And I dare further assure any that will carrie provision enough for a yeare and a halfe, shall not neede to feare want, if he ei|ther be industrious himselfe, or have industrious agents to mannage his estate and affaires. And whereas many doe dis|parrage the land saying a man cannot live without labour, in that they more disparage and discredit themselves, in giving
<PB N="48" REF="31">
the world occasion to take notice of their droanish dispositi|on, that would live of the sweate of another mans browes: surely they were much deceived, or else ill informed, that ventured thither in hope to live in plenty and idlenesse, both at a time: and it is as much pitty as he that can worke and will not, should eate, as it is pitty that he that would worke and cannot, should fast. I condemne not such therefore as are now there, and are not able to worke; but I advise for the future those men that are of weake constitutions to keepe at home, if their estates cannot maintaine servants. For all new <HI>England</HI> must be workers in some kinde: and whereas it hath beene formerly reported that boyes of tenne or a twelve yeares of age might doe much more than get their living, that cannot be, for he must have more than a boyes head, and no lesse than a mans strength, that intends to live comfortably; and hee that hath understanding and Industrie, with a stocke of an hundered pound, shall live better there, than he shall doe here of twen|ty pound <HI>per annum.</HI> But many I know will say if it be thus, how comes it to passe then that they are so poore? To which I answere, that they are poore but in comparison, compare them with the rich Merchants or great landed men in <HI>England,</HI> and then I know they will seeme poore. There is no probability they should be exceeding rich, because none of such great estate went over yet; besides, a man of estate must first scatter before he gather, he must lay out monies for transporting of servants, and cattle and goods, for hou|ses and fences and gardens, &amp;c. This may make his purse seeme light, and to the eye of others seeme a leaking in his estate, whereas these disbursments are for his future enrich|ments: for he being once well seated and quietly setled, his increase comes in double; and howsoever they are accounted poore, they are well contented, and looke not so much at abundance, as a competencie; so little is the poverty of the Country, that I am perswaded if many in <HI>England</HI> which are constrained to begge their bread were there, they would live better than many doe here, that have money to buy it. Furthermore when corne is scarse, yet may they have either
<PB N="49" REF="31">
or flesh for their labour: and surely that place is not miserably poore to them that are there, where foure Egges may be had for a Penny, and a quart of new Milke at the same rate: Where Butter is sixe-pence a pound, and Cheshire-Cheese at five pence; sure <HI>Middlesex</HI> affoords <HI>London</HI> no better penny-worths. What though there be no such plenty, as to cry these things in the streetes? yet every day affords these penny-worths to those that neede them in most places. I dare not say in all: Can they be very poore, where for foure thou|sand soules, there are fifteene hundred head of Cattle, be|sides foure thousand Goates, and Swine innumerable? In an ill sheepe-yeare I have knowne Mutton as deere in <HI>Old-Eng|land,</HI> and deerer than Goates-flesh is in <HI>New-England,</HI> which is altogether as good if fancy be set aside.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. What provision is to be made for a Iourney at Sea, and and what to carry with us for our use at Land.</HEAD>
<P>MAny peradventure at the looking over of these relati|ons, may have inclinations or resolution for the Voy|age, to whom I wish all prosperity in their undertakings; although I will use no forcive arguments to perswade any, but leave them to the relation; yet by way of advice, I would commend to them a few lines from the Pen of experience. And because the way to <HI>New England</HI> is over Sea, it will not be amisse to give you directions, what is most necessary to bee carried. Many I suppose, know as well, or better than my selfe; yet all doe not, to those my directions tend; although e|very man have ship-provisions allowed him for his five pound a man, which is salt Beefe, Porke, salt Fish, Butter, Cheese, Pease, Pottage, Water-grewell, and such kinde of Victu|als, with good Biskets, and sixe-shilling Beere: yet will it be necessary, to carry some comfortable refreshing of fresh victuall. As first, for such as have ability, some Conserved, and good Clarret Wine to burne at Sea: Or you may have
<PB N="50" REF="32">
it by some of your Vintners or Wine-Coopers burned here, &amp; put up into vessels, which will keepe much better than other burnt Wine, is a very comfortable thing for the stomacke; or such as are Sea-sicke: Sallet-oyle likewise. Prunes are good to be stewed; Sugar for many things: White Biskets, and Egs, and Bacon, Rice, Poultry, and some weather-sheepe to kill aboard the ship; and fine flowre-baked meates, will keepe a|bout a weeke or nine dayes at Sea. Iuyce of Lemons well put up, is good either to prevent or cure the Scurvy. Here it must not be forgotten to carry small Skillets, or Pipkins, and small frying-panns, to dresse their victuals in at Sea. For bedding, so it be easie, and cleanely, and warme, it is no matter how old or coarse it be for the use of the Sea; and so likewise for Apparrell, the oldest cloathes be the fittest, with a long coarse coate, to keepe better things from the pitched ropes and plankes. Whosoever shall put to Sea in a stoute and well-conditioned ship, having an honest Master, and loving Sea|men, shall not neede to feare, but he shall finde as good con|tent at Sea, as at Land.</P>
<P>It is too common with many to feare the Sea more than they neede, and all such as put to Sea, confesse it to be lesse tedi|ous than they either feared or expected. A ship at Sea may well be compared to a Cradle, rocked by a carefull Mothers hand, which though it be moved up and downe, yet is it not in danger of falling: So a ship may often be rocked too and againe upon the troublesome Sea, yet seldome doth it sinke or over-turne, because it is kept by that carefull hand of Providence by which it is rocked. It was never knowne yet, that any ship in that voyage was cast away, or that ever fell into the Enemies hand.</P>
<P>For the health of Passengers it hath beene observed, that of sixe hundred soules, not above three or foure haue dyed at Sea: It is probable in such a company, more might have dyed either by sicknesse or casualities, if they had stayed at home. For Women, I see not but that they doe as well as men, and young Children as well as either; having their healths as well a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sea as at Land: Many likewise which have come with such foule bodies to Sea, as did make their dayes uncomfortable
<PB N="51" REF="32">
at Land, have beene so purged and clarified at Sea, that they have beene more healthfull for after-times; their weake appe|tites being turned to good stomackes, not onely desiring, but likewise disgesting such victuals as the Sea affords. Secondly, for directions for the Countrey, it is not to be feared, but that men of good estates may doe well there; alwayes provi|ded, that they goe wel accommodated with servants. In which I would not wish them to take over-many: tenne or twelve lusty servants being able to mannage an estate of two or three thousand pound. It is not the multiplicity of many bad ser|vants, (which presently eates a man out of house and harbour, as lamentable experience hath made manifest) but the in|dustry of the faithfull and diligent labourer, that enricheth the carefull Master; so that he that hath many dronish servants&punc; shall soone be poore; and he that hath an industrious family, shall as soone be rich.</P>
<P>Now for the incouragement of his men, he must not doe as many have done, (more through ignorance than desire) carry many mouthes, and no meate; but rather much meate for a few mouthes. Want of due maintenance produceth no|thing but a grumbling spirit with a sluggish idlenesse, when as those servants which be well provided for, goe thorough their imployments with speede and cheerefulnesse. For meale, it will be requisite to carry a Hogshead and a halfe, for every one that is a labourer, to keepe him till hee may receive the fruite of his owne labours, which will be a yeare and a halfe after his arrivall, if hee land in <HI>May</HI> or <HI>Iune.</HI> He must like|wise carry Malt, Beefe&punc; Butter, Cheese, some Pease, good Wines, Vinegar, Strong-waters, &amp;c. Whosoever trans|ports more of these than he himselfe useth, his over-plus be|ing sold, will yeeld as much profit as any other staple commo|dity. Euery man likewise must carry over good store of Ap|parrell; for if he come to buy it there, he shall finde it dearer than in <HI>England.</HI> Woollen-cloth is a very good co~modity, and Linnen better; as Holland, Lockram, flaxen, Hempen, Cal|lico stuffes, Linsey-woolfies, and blew Callicoe, greene Sayes for Housewives aprons, Hats, Bootes, Shooes, good <HI>Irish</HI> stockings, which if they be good, are much more service|able
<PB N="52" REF="33">
than knit-ones. All kind of grocery wares, as Sugar, Prunes, Raisons, Currants, Honey, Nutmegs, Clover, &amp;c. Sope, Candles, and Lamps, &amp;c. All manner of hous|hold stuffe is very good Trade there, as Pewter and Brasse, but great Iron-pots be preferred before Brasse, for the use of that Country. Warming-pannes and Stewing-pannes bee of necessary use, and good Trafficke there. All manner of Iron|wares, as all manner of nailes for houses, and all manner of Spikes for building of Boates, Ships, and fishing stages: all manner of tooles for Workemen, Hoes for planters, broad and narrow for setting and weeding; with Axes both broad an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> pitching-axes. All manner of Angers, piercing bits, Whip-saws, Two-handed saws, Froes, both for the riving of Pailes and Laths, rings for Beetles heads, and Iron-wedges; though all these be made in the Countrey: (there being divers Blacke-smiths) yet being a heavy commodity, and taking but a little stoage, it is cheaper to carry such commo|dities out of <HI>England.</HI> Glasse ought not to be forgotten of a|ny that desire to benefit themselves, or the Countrey: if it be well leaded, and carefully pack't up, I know no commodity better for portage or sayle. Here likewise must not be for|gotten all vtensils for the Sea, as Barbels, splitting-knives, Leads, and Cod-hookes, and Lines, Machrill-hooks and lines, Sharke-hookes, Seanes, or Basse nets, large and strong; Herring-nets, &amp;c. Such as would eate Fowle, must not for|get their sixe-foote Gunnes, their good Powder and shot, of all sorts; a great round shot called <HI>Bastable</HI>-shot, is the best&punc; being made of a blacker Lead than ordinary shot: Further|more, good Pooldavies to make sayles for Boates, Roads, and Anchors for Boates and Pinnaces, be good; Sea-coale, Iron, Lead, and Mil-stones, Flints, Ordonances, and whatsoever a man can conceive is good for the Countrey, that will lie a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ballast, he cannot be a loser by it. And lest I should forget a thing of so great importance, no man must neglect to provide for himselfe, or those belonging to him, his munition for the defence of himselfe and the Countrey. For there is no man there that beares a head, but that beares mi|litary Armes; even Boyes of fourteene yeares of age, are
<PB N="53" REF="33">
practised with men in militarie discipline, every three weeks. Who soever shall carrie over Drummes and <HI>English</HI> Colours, Pattesons, Halberds, Pickes, Muskets, Bandelerous, with Swords, shall not neede to feare good gaine for them, such things being wanting in the country: Likewise whatsoever shall be needefull for fortifications of holds and Castles, whereby the common enemy may be kept out in future times, is much desired. They as yet have had no great cause to feare; but because securitie hath beene the overthrow of many a new plantation, it is their care according to their abilities, to secure themselves by fortifications, as well as they can: Thus having shewed what commodities are most usefull, it will not be amisse to shew you what men be most fit for these plantations.</P>
<P>First, men of good working, and contriving heads, a well experienced common wealths man for the good of the bo|dy politicke in matters of advice and counsell, a well skilled and industrious husbandman, for tillage and improvements of grounds; an ingenious Carpenter, a cunning Ioyner, a handsome Cooper, such a one as can make strong ware for the use of the countrie, and a good Brickmaker, a Tyler and a Smith, a Leather dresser, a Gardner, and a Taylour: one that hath good skill in the trade of fishing, is of speciall use, and so is a good Fowler, if there be any that hath skill in any of these trades, if he can transport himselfe, he needs not feare but he may improve his time and endeavours to his owne benefit, and comfort; if any cannot transport himselfe, he may provide himselfe of an honest master, and so may doe as well. There is is as much freedome and liberty for servants as in <HI>England</HI> and more too; a wronged servant shall have right <HI>volens nolens</HI> from his injurious master, and a wronged master shall have right of his injurious servant, as well as here: Wherefore let no servant be discouraged from the voyage, that intends it. And now whereas it is generally reported, that servants and poore men grow rich, and the masters and Gentrie grow poore; I must needs confesse that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he diligent hand makes rich, and that labouring men having good store of employments, and as good pay&punc;
<PB N="54" REF="34">
live well, and contentedly; but I cannot perceive that those that set them a worke are any way impoverished by them; peradventure they have lesse monie by reason of them, but never the lesse riches; a mans worke well done being more beneficiall than his monie, or other dead commodities, which otherwise would lye by him to no purpose. Many men be so improvident as to set men about building of Ca|stles in the Aire, or other unnecessary employments, he may grow poore; but such as employ labourers about planting of Corne, building of houses, fenceing in of ground, fishing, and divers other necessary occasions, shall receive as much or more by poore mens labours, than those that live in <HI>England</HI> doe from the industrie of such as they hire: Wherefore I doe suppose this to be but the surmisings of some that are ignorant of the state of the countrey, or else misinformed by some ill willers to the plantations. Many objections I know are daily invented, to hinder the pro|ceedings of these new plantations, which may dampe the un|setled spirits of such as are not greatly affected with those undertakings; Some say the <HI>Spaniard</HI> layes claime to the whole country, being the first discoverer hereof, and that he may make invasion upon those parts as well as he hath done upon S. <HI>Christophers,</HI> and S. <HI>Martins,</HI> and those places: but it doth not follow that because he tooke such places as lay just in his way to the <HI>West Indies,</HI> that hee should come thousands of miles with a great Navie to plant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tions, as yet not worth the pillage: and when the plantations are growne noted in the eyes of the common foes for wealth, it is ho|ped that when the Bees have Honie in their Hives, they will have stings in their tailes. Hath not <HI>Virginia</HI> beene plan|ted many yeares which is foure hundred miles nearer the <HI>Spaniards</HI> course, and yet never met with any affrontments; so that this scruple smells of feare and pusill-animitie. To wipe away all groundlesse calumniations, and to answer to every too too curious objections, and frivolous question (some so simple as not ashamed to aske whether the Sunne shines there or no) were to run in infinitum; but I hope that the severall manuscripts and letters, and informations by
<PB N="55" REF="34">
word of mouth from such of our honest countrimen which daily have recourse unto us, have given full satisfaction to such as are well willers to the plantations: and for such as are estrang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to it in affection, if every word that hath beene eyther writ or spoken were a forcive argument, yet would it be two little to steddie their beleefe in any one par|ticular concerning the country. Some are nimble eared to heare faults, and so ready tongued to publish them, yea often times with strained constructions; a false asseveration usu|ally winneth more beleefe than two verifying negatives can resettle: Some there are who count with <HI>Claudian</HI> that it is an incomparable happinesse to have their birth, life &amp; bury|ing in the same place: these are never likly to remove further than the shell of their owne countrie. But because there are some noble spirits that devote their states, and their persons, to the common good of their king and country, I have therefore for their direction and delight made this relation&punc; For as the end of my travell was observation, so I desire the end of my observation may tend to the information of others: As I have observed what I have seene, and written what I have observed, so doe I desire to publish what I have written, desiring it may be beneficiall to posteritie; and if any man desire to fill himselfe at that fountaine, from whence this tasting cup was taken, his owne experience shall tell him as much as I have here related, and thus I passe from the country as it stands to the <HI>English,</HI> and come to dis|course how it stands to the old Natives, and they to it, as followeth.</P>

<P>These are a cruell bloody people, which were wont to come downe upon their poore neighbours with more than brui|tish savagenesse, spoyling of their Corne, burning their hou|ses, slaying men, ravishing women, yea very Caniballs they were, sometimes eating on a man one part after ano|ther before his face, and while yet living; in so much that the very name of a <HI>Mowhack</HI> would strike the heart of a poore <HI>Abergenian</HI> dead, were here not hopes at hand of releefe from <HI>English</HI> to succour them: For these inhumane homici|des confesse that they dare not meddle with a white faced man, accompanyed with his hot mouth'd weapon.

About 2 yeares agoe, our <HI>Indians</HI> being busie about their accustomed huntings, not suspecting them so neere their owne liberties, were on the suddaine surprized by them, some being slaine, the rest escaping to their <HI>English Asylum,</HI> whither they durst not pursue them; their <HI>Sagamore</HI> was wounded by an arrow, but presently cured by <HI>English</HI> Chirurgery.

Mint-masters. From hence they have most of their curious Pendants &amp; Bracelets; from hence they have their great stone|pipes, which wil hold a quarter of an ounce of Tobacco, which they make with steele-drils and other instruments; such is their ingenuity &amp; dexterity, that they can imitate the <HI>English</HI> mold so accurately, that were it not for matter and colour it were hard to distinguish them; they make the~ of greene, &amp; some|times of blacke stone; they be much desired of our <HI>English</HI> Tobaconists, for their rarity, strength, handsomnesse, and coolnesse.

arm'd, long and slender handed, out brested, small wasted, lanke bellied, well thighed, flat kneed, handsome growne l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ggs, and small feete: In a word, take them when the blood briskes in their veines, when the flesh is on their backs, and marrow in their bones, when they frolick in their antique deportments and <HI>Indian</HI> postures; and they are more amia|ble to behold (though onely in <HI>Adams</HI> livery) than many a compounded phantasticke in the newest fashion. It may puzzle beliefe, to conceive how such lustie bodies should have their rise and daily supportment from so slender a fo|stering; their houses being meane, their lodging as homely, commons scant, their drinke water, and Nature their best cloathing; in them the old proverbe may well be verified: (<HI>Natura paucis contenta</HI>) for though this be their daily por|tion, they still are healthfull and lusty. I have beene in many places, yet did I never see one that was borne either in re|dundance or defect a monster, or any that sicknesse had de|formed, or casualitie made decrepit, saving one that had a bleared eye, and an other that had a wenne on his cheeke. The reason is rendred why they grow so proportionable, and continue so long in their vigour (most of them being 50 before a wrinkled brow or gray haire bewray their age) is because they are not brought downe with suppressing la|bour, vexed with annoying cares, or drowned in the exces|sive abuse of overflowing plenty, which oftentimes kils them more than want, as may appeare in them. For when they change their bare <HI>Indian</HI> commons for the plenty of <HI>Englands</HI> fuller diet, it is so contrary to their stomacks, that death or a desperate sicknesse immediately accrews, which makes so few of them desirous to see <HI>England.</HI> Their swar|thinesse is the Sun's livery, for they are borne faire. Their smooth skins proceede from the often anoynting of their bodies with the oyle of fishes, and the fat of Eagles, with the grease of Rackoones, which they hold in summer, the best antidote to keepe their skinne from blistering with the scorching Sunne; and it is their best armour against the Mus|ketoes, the surest expeller of the hairy excrement, and stops the pores of their bodies against the nipping winters cold.
<PB N="64" REF="39">
Their black haire is naturall, yet it is brought to a more jet|ty colour by oyling, dying, and daily dressing. Sometimes they weare it very long, hanging down in a loose dishevel'd womanish manner; otherwhile tied up hard and short like a horse taile, bound close with a fillet, which they say makes it grow the faster: they are not a little phantasticall or custom-sick in this particular; their boyes being not permitted to weare their haire long till sixteene yeares of age, and then they must come to it by degrees; some being cut with a long foretop, a long locke on the crowne, one of each side of his head, the rest of his haire being cut even with the scalpe: the young men and souldiers weare their haire long on the one side, the other side being cut short like a screw; other cuts they have as their fancie befooles them, which would torture the wits of a curious Barber to imitate. But though they be thus wedded to the haire of their head, you cannot wooe them to weare it on their chinnes, where it no sooner growes, but it is stubbed up by the rootes, for they count it as an unusefull, cumbersome, and opprobrious excre|ment, insomuch as they call him an <HI>English</HI> mans bastard that hath but the appearance of a beard, which some have growing in a staring fashion, like the beard of a cat, which makes them the more out of love with them, choosing ra|ther to have no beards than such as should make them ridi|culous.</P>

In the Winter time the more aged of them weare leather drawers, in forme like <HI>Irish</HI> trouses, fastned under their girdle with buttons; they weare shooes likewise of their owne making cut out of a Mooses hide, many of them weare skinnes about them, in forme of an <HI>Irish</HI> mantle, and of these some be Beares skinnes, Mooses skinnes, and Beaver skinnes sewed toge|ther, Otter skinnes, and Rackoone skinnes; most of them in the Winter having his deepe furr'd Cat skinne, like a long large muffe, which hee shifts to that arme which lieth most exposed to the winde; thus clad, hee busles better through a world of cold in a frost-paved wildernesse, than the furred Citizen in his warmer Stoave. If their fancie drive them to trade, they choose rather a good course blanket, thorough which they cannot see, interposing it betweene the sunne and them; or a piece of broade cloth, which they use for a double end, making it a coate by day, and a covering by night; they love not to be imprisoned in our <HI>English</HI> fashion: they love their owne dogge fashion better (of shaking their eares, and being ready in a moment) than to spend time in dressing them, though they may as well spare it as any men I know, having little else to doe. But the chiefe reasons they render why they will not conforme to our <HI>English</HI> apparell, are, because their women cannot wash them when they bee soyled, and their meanes will not reach to buy new when they have done with their old; and they confidently beleeve, the <HI>English</HI> will not be so liberall as to furnish them upon gif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ure: therefore they had rather goe naked than be lousie, and bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g their bodies out of their old tune, making them more tender by a new acquired habit, which poverty would constraine them to leave: although they be thus poore, yet is there in them the sparkes of naturall pride, which ap|peares in their longing desire after many kinde of orna|ments, wearing pendants in their eares, as formes of birds,

beasts, and fishes, carved out of bone, shels, and stone, with long bracelets of their curious wrought wampompeage and mowhackees, which they put about their necks and loynes; these they count a rare kinde of decking; many of the better sort bearing upon their cheekes certaine pourtraitures of beasts, as Beares, Deares, Mooses, Wolves, &amp;c. some of fowls, as of Eagles, Hawkes, &amp;c. which be not a superficiall pain|ting, but a certaine incision, or else a raising of their skin by a small sharpe instrument, under which they conveigh a cer|tain kind of black unchangeable inke, which makes the de|sired forme apparent and permanent. Others have certaine round Impressions downe the outside of their armes and brests, in forme of mullets or spur-rowels, which they im|print by searing irons: whether these be foiles to illustrate their unparalleld beauty (as they deeme it) or Armes to bla|zon their antique Gentilitie, I cannot easily determine: but a Sagamore with a Humberd in his eare for a pendant, a black hawke on his <HI>occiput</HI> for his plume, Mowhackees for his gold chaine, good store of Wampompeage begi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting his loynes, his bow in his hand, his quiver at his back. with six naked <HI>Indian</HI> spatterlashes at his heeles for his guard, thinkes himselfe little inferiour to the great <HI>Cham</HI>; hee will not stick to say, hee is all one with King <HI>Charles.</HI> He thinkes hee can blow downe Castles with his breath, and conquer kingdomes with his conceit.

In Winter-time they have all manner of fowles of the water and of the land, &amp; beasts of the land and water, pond-fish, with Catharres and other rootes, <HI>Indi|an</HI> beanes and Clamms. In the Summer they have all manner of Sea-fish, with all sorts of Berries. For the ordering of their victuals, they boile or roast them, having large Kettles which they traded for with the <HI>French</HI> long since, and doe still buy of the <HI>English</HI> as their neede requires, before they had substantiall earthen pots of their owne making. Their spits are no other than cloven sticks sharped at one end to thrust into the ground; into these cloven sticks they thrust the flesh or fish they would have rosted, behemming a round fire with a dozen of spits at a time, turning them as they see occasion. Some of their scullerie having dressed these homely cates, presents it to his guests, dishing it up in a rude manner, placing it on the verdent carpet of the earth which Nature spreads them, without either trenchers napkins, or knives, upon which their hunger-sawced sto|macks impatient of delayes, fals aboard without scrupling at unwashed hands, without bread, salt, or beere: lolling on the Turkish fashion, not ceasing till their full bellies leave nothing but emptie platters: they seldome or never make bread of their <HI>Indian</HI> corne, but seeth it whole like beanes, eating three or foure cornes with a mouthfull of fish or flesh, sometimes eating meate first, and cornes after, filling chinkes with their broth. In Summer, when their corne is spent, Isquoutersquashes is their best bread, a fruite like a young Pumpion. To say, and to speake paradoxically, they be great eaters, and yet little meate-men; when they visit our <HI>English,</HI> being invited to eate, they are very moderate, whether it be to shew their manners, or for shamefastnesse, I know not; but at home they will eate till their bellies stand south, ready to split with fulnesse; it being their fashi|on to eate all at some times, and sometimes nothing at all in two or three dayes, wise Providence being a stranger to their wilder wayes: they be right Infidels, neither caring

for the morrow, or providing for their owne families; but as all are fellowes at foot-ball, so they all meete friends at the kettle, saving their Wives, that dance a Spaniell-like at|tendance at their backes for their bony fragments. If their imperious occasions cause them to travell, the best of their victuals for their journey is <HI>Nocake,</HI> (as they call it) which is nothing but <HI>Indian</HI> Corne parched in the hot ashes; the ashes being sifted from it, it is afterward beaten to powder, and put into a long leatherne bag, trussed at their backe like a knapsacke; out of which they take thrice three spoonefulls a day, dividing it into three meales. If it be in Winter, and Snow be on the ground, they can eate when they please, stop|ping Snow after their dusty victuals, which otherwise would feed the~ little better than a Tiburne halter. In Su~mer they must stay till they meete with a Spring or Brooke, where they may have water to prevent the imminent danger of choaking&punc; with this strange <HI>viaticum</HI> they will travell foure ot five daies together, with loads fitter for Elephants than men. But though they can fare so hardly abroad, at home their chaps must walke night and day as long as they have it.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. Of their dispositions and good qualifications, as friend|ship, constancy, truth, and affability.</HEAD>
<P>TO enter into a serious discourse concerning the naturall conditions of these <HI>Indians,</HI> might procure admiration from the people of any civilized Nations, in regard of their civility and good natures. If a Tree may be judged by his fruite, and dispositions calculated by exteriour actions; then may it be concluded, that these <HI>Indians</HI> are of affable, courte|ous, and well disposed natures, ready to communicate the best of their wealth to the mutuall good of one another; and the lesse abundance they have, to manifest their entire friend|ship; so much the more perspicuous is their love, in that they are as willing to part with their Mite in poverty, as treasure in plenty. As he that kills a Deere, sends for his friends, and eates it merrily: So he that receives but a piece of bread from an <HI>English</HI> hand, parts it equally betweene himselfe and his comerades and eates it lovingly. In a word, a friend can com|mand his friend, his house, and whatsoever is his, (saving his Wife) and have it freely: And as they are love-linked thus in common courtesie, so are they no way sooner dis-joynted than by ingratitude; accounting an ungratefull person a double rob|ber of a man, not onely of his courtesie, but of his thankes which he might receive of another for the same proffered, or received kindnesse. Such is their love to one another, that they cannot endure to see their Countrey-men wronged, but will stand stiffely in their defence: plead strongly in their be|halfe, and justifie one anothers integrities in any warrantable action. If it were possible to recount the courtesies they have shewed the <HI>English,</HI> since their first arrivall in those parts, it would not onely steddy beleefe, that they are a loving peo|ple, but also winne the love of those that never saw them, and wipe off that needelesse feare that is too deepely rooted in the conceits of many, who thinke them envious, and of such rankerous and inhumane dispositions, that they will one day
<PB N="70" REF="42">
make an end of their <HI>English</HI> inmates. The worst indeede may be surmised, but the <HI>English</HI> hitherto have had little cause to suspect them, but rather to be convinced of their trustinesse, seeing they have as yet beene the disclosers of all such treacheries as have bin practised by other <HI>Indians.</HI> And whereas once there was a proffer of an universall League a|mongst all the <HI>Indians</HI> in those parts, to the intent that they might all joyne in one united force, to extirpiate the <HI>English,</HI> our <HI>Indian<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> refused the motion, replying, they had rather be servants to the <HI>English,</HI> of whom they were confident to re|ceive no harme, and from whom they had received so many favours, and assured good testimonies of their Iove, than e|quals with them, who would cut their throates upon the least offence, and make them the shambles of their cruelty. Fur|thermore, if any roaving ships be upon the coasts, and chance to harbour either East-ward, North-ward, or South-ward in any unusuall Port, they will giue us certaine intelligence of her burthen and forces, describing their men either by lan|guage or features; which is a great priviledge and no small ad|vantage. Many wayes hath their advice and endeavour beene advantagious unto us; they being our first instructers for the planting of their <HI>Indian</HI> Corne, by teaching us to cull out the finest seede, to observe the fittest season, to keepe distance for holes, and fit measure for hills, to worme it, and weede it; to prune it, and dresse it as occasion shall require.</P>
<P>These <HI>Indians</HI> be very hospitable, insomuch that when the <HI>English</HI> have trauelled forty, fifty, or threescore miles into the Countrey, they have entertained them into their houses, quartered them by themselves in the best roomes, providing the best victuals they could, expressing their welcome in as good termes as could be expected from their slender breeding; shewing more love than complement, not grumbling for a fortnights or three weekes tarrying; but rather caring to pro|vide accommodation correspondent to their <HI>English</HI> custome. The doubtfull traveller hath oftentimes beene much beholding to them for their guidance thorow the unbeaten Wildernesse: my selfe in this particular can doe no lesse in the due acknow|ledgment of their love, than speake their commendations, who

An unexperienced wood man ranging in the woods for Deere, traveled so farre beyond his knowledge, till he could not tell how to get out of the wood for trees, but the more he sought to di|rect himselfe out, the more he ranne himselfe in, from the home he most desired; the night came upon him preven|ting his walking, and the extremitie of cold seasing upon his right foote for want of warming motion, deprived him of the use thereof, so that he could not remoove farther than his snowie bed, but had there ended his dayes, had not sixe commiserating <HI>Indians,</HI> who heard of his wandering, found him out by diligent search, being almost dead with despaire and cold: but after they had conquered his despaire with the assurance of his safe conduction to his habitation, and expelled the cold by the infusion of strong waters which they brought for the same purpose; they framed a thing like

Such is the wisedome and pollicie of these poore men, that they will be sure to keepe correspon|dence with our <HI>English</HI> Magistrates, expressing their love in the execution of any service they command them, so far as lyes in their powre, as may appeare in this one particular. A certaine man having layd himselfe open to the Kings lawes, fearing atachment, conviction, and consequently ex|ecution: sequestred himselfe from the honest societie of his neighbours, betaking himselfe unto the obscure thickets of the wildernesse, where hee lived for a time undiscovered, till the <HI>Indians</HI> who leave no place unsearched for Deere, found out his haunt, and having taken notice by diverse dis|courses concerning him, how that it was the governers de|sire to know where he was; they thought it a part of their service to certifie him where he kept his rendevouze, who thereupon desired if they could to direct men to him for his attachment, but he had shifted his dwelling, and could not be found for the present, yet he was after seene by other <HI>In|dians,</HI> but being double pistold, and well sworded, they sea|red to approach so neere him as to grapple with him: wherefore they let him alone till his owne necessary businesse cast him upon them; for having occasion to crosse a river, he came to the side thereof, where was an <HI>Indian Cannow</HI>&punc; in which the <HI>Indians</HI> were to crosse the river themselves, hee
<PB N="73" REF="43">
vauntingly commanded waftage; which they willingly graunted, but withall plotting how they might take him prisoner, which they thus effected; having placed him in the midship of their ticklish wherrie, they lanched forth into the deepe, causing the capering <HI>Cannow</HI> to cast out her combersome ballast into the liquid water; which swomme like a stone, and now the water having dank't his pistoles, and lost his <HI>Spanish</HI> progge in the bottome, the <HI>Indians</HI> swomme him out by the chinne to the shore, where having dropt himselfe a little dry, he began to bluster out a storme of rebellious resistance, till they becalmed his pelting chafe with their pelting of pibles at him, afterward leading him as they list to the governour. These people be of a kinde and affable disposition, yet are they very warie with whom they strike hands in friendshippe: nothing is more hate|full to them than a churlish disposition, so likewise is dissi|mulation: he that speakes seldome, and opportunely, being as good as his word, is the onely man they love. The <HI>Spa|niard</HI> they say is all one <HI>Aramouse (viz.</HI> all one as a dog) the <HI>Frenchman</HI> hath a good tongue, but a false heart: The <HI>Eng|lish</HI> man all one speake, all one heart; wherefore they more approve of them than of any Nation: garrulitie is much condemned of them, for they utter not many words, speake seldome, and then with such gravitie as is pleasing to the eare: such as understand them not, desire yet to heare their emphaticall expressions, and lively action; such is the milde temper of their spirits that they cannot endure objurgati|ons, or scoldings. An <HI>Indian Sagomore</HI> once hearing an <HI>Eng|lish</HI> woman scold with her husband, her quicke utterance exceeding his apprehension, her active lungs thundering in his eares, expelled him the house; from whence he went to the next neighbour, where he related the unseemelinesse of her behaviour; her language being strange to him, hee ex|pressed it as strangely, telling them how she cryed Nannana Nannana Nannana Nan, saying he was a great foole to give her the audience, and no correction for usurping his charter, and abusing him by her tongue. I have beene amongst diverse of them, yet did I never see any falling out amongst them, not so much as crosse words, or reviling speeches,

which might provoke to blowes. And whereas it is the custome of many people in their games, if they see the dice runne crosse or their cards not answere their expectations: what cursing and swearing, what imprecations, and raylings, fightings and stabbings oftentimes proceede from their testy spleene. How doe their blustering passions, make the place troublesome to themselves and others? But I have knowne when foure of these milder spirits have sit downe staking their treasures, where they have plaied foure and twentie houres, neither eating drinking or sleeping in the Interim; nay which is most to be wondered at, not quarre|ling, but as they came thither in peace so they depart in peace: when he that had lost all his <HI>wampompeage,</HI> his house, his kettle, his beaver, his batchet, his knife, yea all his little all, having nothing left but his naked selfe, was as merry as they that won it; so in sports of activitie at foote|ball though they play never so fiercely to outward appea|rance, yet angrer-boyling blood never streames in their coo|ler veines, if any man be throwne he laughes out his foyle, there is no seeking of revenge, no quarreling, no bloody noses, scratched faces, blacke eyes, broken shinnes, no bru|sed members, or crushed ribs, the lamentables effects of rage; but the goale being wonne, the goods on the one side lost; friends they were at the footeball, and friends they must meete at the kettle. I never heard yet of that <HI>Indian</HI> that was his neighbours homicide or vexation by his malepart, fancy, or uncivill tongue: laughter in them is not common, seldome exceeding a smile, never breaking out into such a lowd laughter, as doe many of our <HI>English.</HI> Of all things they love not to be laught at upon any occasion; if a man be in trade with them and the bargaine be almost strucke, if they perceive you laugh, they will scarce proceed, supposing you laugh because you have cheated them: the <HI>Crocodiles</HI> teares may sooner deceive them, than the <HI>Hienas</HI> smiles: although they be not much addicted to laughter, yet are they not of a dumpish sad nature, but rather naturally chearefull: A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I never saw a gigling <HI>Democrite,</HI> so I never saw a teare drop|ping <HI>Heraclite</HI>; no disaster being so prevalent as to open the

<P>FOr their hardinesse it may procure admiration, no ordi|nary paines making them so much as alter their counte|nance; beate them, whip them, pinch them, punch them, if they resolve not to whinch for it, they will not; whether it be their benummed insensiblenesse of smart, or their hardie resolutions, I cannot tell; It might be, a <HI>Perillus</HI> his Bull, or the disjoynting racke might force a roare from them, but a Turkish drubbing would not much molest them, and al|though they be naturally much affraid of death, yet the un|expected approach of a mortall wound by a Bullet, Arrow, or Sword, strikes no more terrour, causes no more exclamation, no more complaint, or whinching, than if it had beene a shot into the body of a tree: such woun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s as would be suddaine death to an <HI>English</HI> man, would be nothing to them. Some of them having beene shot in at the mouth, and out under the eare, some shot in the breast, some runne thorough the flankes with Darts, and other many desperate wounds which eyther by their rare skill in the use of vegitatives, or diabolicall charmes they cure in short time. Although their hardinesse beare them out in such things wherein they are sure death will not ensue, yet can it not expell the feare of death, the very name and thoughts of it is so hideous to them, or any thing that presents it, or threatens it, so terrible; insomuch that a hundred of them will runne from two or three Guns, though they know they can but dispatch two or three at a discharge, yet every man fearing it may be his lot to meete with his last, will not come neare that in good earnest, which he dare play withall in jest. To make this good by a passage of Experience. Three men having occa|sion of trade amongst the Westerne <HI>Indians,</HI> went up with some such commodities as they thought most fit for trade;
<PB N="76" REF="45">
to secure their person they tooke a Carbine, two Pistoles and a sword, which in outward shew was not great resi|stance to a hundred well skilled bow men: The <HI>Indians</HI> hea|ring their gunnes making a thundring noyse, desired to finger one of them, &amp; see it discharged into a tree, wondring much at the percussion of the bullet; but they abiding two or three dayes, the gunnes were forgotten, and they began to looke at the oddes being a hundred to three, whereupon they were animated to worke treason against the lives of these men, and to take away their goods from them by force; but one of the <HI>English</HI> understanding their language, smelt out their treachery, and being more fully enformed of their intent by the <HI>Indian</HI> women, who had more pitty, hee steps to their King, and hailing him by the long haire from the rest of his councell, commanded him either to goe before him and guide him home, or else he would there kill him. The Saga|more seeing him so rough, had not the courage to resist him, but went with him two miles; but being exasperated by his men who followed him along, to resist, and goe no further; in the end hee would not, neither for faire promises nor fierce threatnings, so that they were constrained there to kill him, which struck such an amazement and daunting into the rest of that naked crew, with the sight of the guns, that though they might easily have killed them, yet had they not the power to shoot an arrow, but followed them, yelling and howling for the death of their King forty miles; his goods being left among them, he sent word by other <HI>Indi|ans,</HI> that unlesse they sent him his goods againe, which hee there left, hee would serve them as hee served their King, whereupon they returned him his commodities, with in|treaty of peace, and promises of fairer trade if he came again. If these heartlesse <HI>Indians</HI> were so cowed with so slender an onset on their owne dunghill, when there were scarce six families of ours in the Countrie, what need wee now feare them being growne into thousands, and having knowledge of martiall discipline? In the night they neede not to be fea|red, for they will not budge from their owne dwellings for feare of their <HI>Abamacho</HI> (the Devill) whom they much

feare, specially in evill enterprizes, they will rather lye by an <HI>English</HI> fire than goe a quarter of a mile in the darke to their owne dwellings: but they are well freed from this scare|crow since the comming of the <HI>English,</HI> and lesse care for his delusions; and whereas it hath beene reported, that there are such horrible apparitions, fearefull roarings, thundering and lightning raised by the Devill, to discourage the <HI>English</HI> in their settling, I for mine owne part never saw or heard of any of these things in the Countrie: nor have I heard of any <HI>Indians</HI> that have lately beene put in feare, saving two or three, and they worse scar'd than hurt, who seeing a Black-more in the top of a tree, looking out for his way which he had lost, surmised he was <HI>Abamacho</HI> or the Devill, deem|ing all Devils that are blacker than themselves; and being neare to the plantation, they posted to the <HI>English,</HI> and intrea|ted their aide to conjure this Devill to his owne place, who finding him to be a poore wandring Black-moore, condu|cted him to his Master.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. Of their wondering at the first view of any strange invention.</HEAD>
<P>THese <HI>Indians</HI> being strangers to Arts and Sciences, and being unacquainted with the inventions that are com|mon to a civilized people, are ravisht with admiration at the first view of any such sight: They tooke the first Ship they saw for a walking Iland, the Mast to be a Tree, the Saile white Clouds, and the discharging of Ordinance for Light|ning and Thunder, which did much trouble them, but this thunder being over, and this moving Iland stedied with an Anchor, they manned out their cannowes to goe and picke strawberries there, but being saluted by the way with a broad side, they cried out, what much hoggery, so bigge walke, and so bigge speake, and by and by kill; which caused them to turne back, not daring to approach till they were sent for. They doe much extoll and wonder at the <HI>English</HI>
<PB N="78" REF="46">
for their strange Inventions, especially for a Wind-mill, which in their esteeme was little lesse than the worlds won|der, for the strangenesse of his whisking motion, and the sharpe teeth biting the corne (as they terme it) into such small peeces; they were loath at the first to come neere to his long armes, or to abide in so tottering a tabernacle, though now they dare goe any where so farre as they have an <HI>English</HI> guide. The first plow-man was counted little better than a Iuggler: the <HI>Indians</HI> seeing the plow teare up more ground in a day, than their Clamme shels could scrape up in a month, desired to see the workemanship of it, and viewing well the coulter and share, perceiving it to be iron, told the plow-man, hee was almost <HI>Abamocho,</HI> almost as cunning as the Devill; but the fresh supplies of new and strange objects hath lessen'd their admiration, and quickned their inventions, and desire of practising such things as they see, wherein they expresse no small ingenuitie, and dexterity of wit, being neither furthered by art, or long experience. It is thought they would soon learne any mechanicall trades, having quicke wits, understanding apprehensions, strong memories, with nimble inventions, and a quicke hand in using of the Axe or Hatchet, or such like tooles; much good might they receive from the <HI>English,</HI> and much might they benefit themselves, if they were not strongly fettered in the chaines of idlenesse; so as that they had rather starve than worke, following no employments, saving such as are sweet|ned with more pleasures and profit than paines or care, and this is indeede one of the greatest accusations that can be laid against them, which lies but upon the men, (the women being very industrious) but it may be hoped that good exam|ple, and good instructions may bring them to a more indu|strious and provident course of life. For already, as they have learned much subtiltie &amp; cunning by bargaining with the <HI>English,</HI> so have they a little degenerated from some of their lazie customes, and shew themselves more industrious. In a word, to set them out in their best colours, they be wise in their carriage, subtle in their dealings, true in their pro|mise, honest in defraying of their debts, though poverty
<PB N="79" REF="46">
constraine them to be something long before; some having died in the <HI>English</HI> debt, have left Beaver by order of Will for their satisfaction: They be constant in friendship, merrily conceited in discourse, not luxuriously abounding in youth, nor dotingly froward in old age, many of them being much civilized since the <HI>English</HI> Colonies were planted, though but little edified in Religion: They frequent often the <HI>English</HI> Churches, where they will sit soberly, though they under|stand not such hidden mysteries. They doe easily beleeve some of the History of the Bible, as the creation of the World, the making of man, with his fall: but come to tell them of a Saviour, with all the passages of the Gospell, and it exceeds so farre their <HI>Indian</HI> beleefe, that they will cry out <HI>(Pocatnie) id est,</HI> is it possible? yet such is their conviction of the right way, that when some <HI>English</HI> have come to their houses, victuals being offered them, forgetting to crave Gods blessing upon the creatures received, they have beene reproved by these, which formerly never knew what calling upon God meant: thus farre for their naturall disposi|tion and qualities.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. Of their Kings government, and Subjects obedience.</HEAD>
<P>NOw for the matter of government amongst them: It is the custome for their Kings to inherite, the sonne al|wayes taking the Kingdome after his fathers death. If there be no sonne, then the Queene rules; if no Queene, the next to the blood-royall, who com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s in otherwise, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut counted an usurping intruder, and if his faire carriage beare him not out the better, they will soone unscepter him.</P>
<P>The Kings have no Lawes to command by, nor have they any annuall revenewes; yet commonly are they so either fea|red or beloved, that halfe their Subjects estate is at their Ser|vice, and their persons at his command; by which command he is better knowne than by any thing else. For though hee hath no Kingly Robes, to make him glorious in the view of his Subjects, nor dayly Guardes to secure his person, or
<PB N="80" REF="47">
Court-like attendance, nor sumptuous Pallaces; yet doe they yeeld all submissive subjection to him, accounting him their Soveraigne; going at his command, and comming at his becke, not so much as expostulating the cause, though it be in matters thwarting their wills; he being accounted a disloy|all subject, that will not effect what his Prince commands. Whosoever is knowne to plot Treason, or to lay violent hands on his lawfull King, is presently executed. Once a yeare he takes his progresse, accompanied with a dozen of his best Subjects to view his Countrey, to recreate himselfe, and establish good order. When he enters into any of their houses, without any more complement, he is desired to sit downe on the ground; (for they use neither stooles nor cushi|ons) and after a little respite, all that be present, come in, and sit downe by him, one of his Seniors pronouncing an Orati|on gratulatory to his Majesty for his love; and the many good things they enjoy under his peacefull government. A King of large Dominions hath his Viceroyes, or inferiour Kings under him, to agitate his State-affaires, and keepe his Subjects in good decorum. Other Officers there be, but how to distin|guish them by name is some-thing difficult: For their Lawes, as their evill courses come short of many other Nations, so they have not so many Lawes, though they be not without some, which they inflict upon notorious malefactors, as Tray|tors to their Prince, inhumane murtherers, and some say for adultery; but I cannot warrant it for a truth. For theft, as they have nothing to steale worth the life of a man, therefore they have no law to execute for trivialls; a Subject being pre|cious in the eye of his Prince, where men are so scarce. A malefactor having deserved death, being apprehended, is brought before the King, and some other of the wisest men, where they enquire out the originall of a thing; after pro|ceeding by aggravation of circumstances, he is found guilty, and being cast by the Iury of their strict inquisition, he is con|demned, and executed on this manner: The Executioner comes in, who blind-folds the party, sets him in the publike view, and braines him with a <HI>Tamahauke</HI> or Club; which done, his friends bury him. Other meanes to restraine abu|ses

Men of ordinary Ranke, ha|ving but one; which disproves the report, that they had eight or tenne Wives apeece. When a man hath a desire to Marry, he first gets the good-will of the Maide or Widdow, after, the consent of her friends for her part; and for himselfe, if he be at his owne disposing, if the King will, the match is made, her Dowry of <HI>Wampompeage</HI> payd, the King joynes their hands with their hearts, never to part till death, unlesse shee prove a Whore; for which they may, and some have put away their Wives, as may appeare by a story. There was one <HI>Abamoch</HI> married a Wife, whom a long time he intire|ly loved above her deservings, for that shee often in his ab|sence entertained strangers, of which hee was oftentimes in|formed by his neighbours; but hee harbouring no sparke of jealousie, beleeved not their false informations (as he deemed them) being in a manner angry they should slander his Wife, of whose constancy hee was so strongly conceited: A long time did her whorish gloazing and Syren-like tongue, with her subtle carriage, establish her in her Husbands favour, till fresh complaints caused him to cast about, how to finde out the truth, and to prove his friends lyars, and his Wife honest, or her a Whore, and his friends true: whereupon hee preten|ded a long journey to visite his friends, providing all accou|traments for a fortnights journey; telling his Wife it would be so long before she could expect his returne, who outward|ly sorrowed for his departure, but inwardly rejoyced, that she should enjoy the society of her old <HI>Lemman</HI>; whom she sent for with expedition, not suspecting her Husbands plot, who lay not many miles off in the Woods; who after their disho|nest

revelings, when they were in their midnight sleepe, approaches the Wiggwamme, enters the doore, which was neither barred nor lockt; makes a light to discover what hee little suspected; but finding his friends words to bee true, hee takes a good bastinado in his hand brought for the same purpose, dragging him by the haire from his usurped bed, so lamentably beating him, that his battered bones and brui|sed flesh made him a fitter object for some skilfull Surgeon, than the lovely obiect of a lustfull strumpet; which done, hee put away his wife, exposing her to the curtesie of stran|gers for her maintenance, that so curtesan-like had entertai|ned a stranger into her bosome.</P>

<P>NOw of their worships: As it is naturall to all mortals to worship something, so doe these people, but exactly to describe to whom their worship is chiefly bent, is very difficult; they acknowledge especially two, <HI>Ketan</HI> who is their good God, to whom they sacrifice (as the ancient Heathen did to <HI>Ceres</HI>) after their garners bee full with a good croppe: upon this God likewise they invocate for faire weather, for raine in time of drought, and for the re|covery of their sick; but if they doe not heare them, then they verifie the old verse, <HI>Flectere si nequeo Superos, Acha|ronta movebo,</HI> their Pow-wows betaking themselves to their exorcismes and necromanticke charmes, by which they bring to passe strange things, if wee may beleeve the <HI>Indians,</HI> who report of one <HI>Pissacannawa,</HI> that hee can make the water burne, the rocks move, the trees dance, metamor|phize himselfe into a flaming man. But it may be objected, this is but <HI>deceptio visus.</HI> Hee will therefore doe more, for in Winter, when there is no greene leaves to be got, he will burne an old one to ashes, and putting those into the water, produce a new greene leafe, which you shall not onely see, but substantially handle and carrie away; and make of a dead
<PB N="83" REF="48">
snakes skinne a living snake, both to be seene, felt, and heard; this I write but upon the report of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who confi|dently affirme stranger things. But to make manifest, that by Gods permission, thorough the Devils helpe, their charmes are of force to produce effects of wonderment; An honest Gentle-man related a storie to mee, being an eye|witnes of the same: A Pow-wow having a patient with the stumpe of some small tree runne thorough his foote, being past the cure of his ordinary Surgery, betooke himselfe to his charmes, and being willing to shew his miracle before the <HI>English</HI> stranger, hee wrapt a piece of cloth about the foote of the lame man; upon that wrapping a Beaver skinne, through which hee laying his mouth to the Beaver skinne, by his sucking charmes he brought out the stumpe, which he spat into a tray of water, returning the foote as whole as its fellow in a short time. The manner of their action in their conjuration is thus: The parties that are sick or lame being brought before them, the Pow-wow sitting downe, the rest of the <HI>Indians</HI> giving attentive audience to his imprecations and invocations, and after the violent expression of many a hideous bellowing and groaning, he makes a stop, and then all the auditors with one voice utter a short <HI>Cant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>; which done, the Pow-wow still proceeds in his invocations, som|times roaring like a Beare, other times groaning like a dying horse, foaming at the mouth like a chased bore, smiting on his naked brest and thighs with such violence, as if he were madde. Thus will hee continue sometimes halfe a day, spen|ding his lungs, sweating out his fat, and tormenting his bo|dy in this diabolicall worship; sometimes the Devill for requitall of their worship, recovers the partie, to nuzzle them up in their divellish Religion. In former time hee was wont to carrie away their wives and children, because hee would drive them to these Mattens, to fetch them again to confirme their beliefe of this his much desired authoritie over them: but since the <HI>English</HI> frequented those parts, they daily fall from his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olours, relinquishing their former fop|peries, and acknowledge our God to be supreame. They ac|knowledge the power of the <HI>English</HI>-ans God, as they call,

him, because they could never yet have power by their con|jurations to damnifie the <HI>English</HI> either in body or goods; and besides, they say hee is a good God that sends them so many good things, so much good corne, so many cattell, temperate raines, faire seasons, which they likewise are the better for since the arrivall of the <HI>English</HI>; the times and seasons being much altered in seven or eight yeares, freer from lightning and thunder, long droughts, suddaine and tempestuous dashes of raine, and lamentable cold Winters.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIIII. Their games and sports of activitie.</HEAD>
<P>BVt to leave their warres, and to speake of their games in which they are more delighted and better experien|ced, spending halfe their dayes in gaming and lazing. They have two sorts of games, one called <HI>Puim,</HI> the other <HI>Hub|bub,</HI> not much unlike Cards and Dice, being no other than Lotterie. <HI>Puim</HI> is 50. or 60. small Bents of a foote long which they divide to the number of their gamesters, shuf|fling them first betweene the palmes of their hands; he that hath more than his fellow is so much the forwa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">der in his game: many other strange whimseyes be in this game; which would be too long to commit to paper; hee that is a noted gamster, hath a great hole in his eare wherein hee carries his <HI>Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">is</HI> in defiance of his antagonists. <HI>Hubbub</HI> is five small Bones in a small smooth Tray, t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e bones bee like a Die, but something f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">atter, blacke on the one side and white on the other, which they place on the ground, against which violentl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> themping the platter, the bones mount changi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">g colours with the windy whisking of their hands too and fro; which action in that sport they much use, smi|ting themselves on the breast, and thighs, crying out, <HI>Hub,
<PB N="86" REF="50">
Hub, Hub</HI>; they may be heard play at this game a quarter of a mile off. The bones being all blacke or white, make a double game; if three be of a colour and two of another, then they affoard but a single game; foure of a colour and one differing is nothing; so long as a man winns, he keepes the Tray: but if he loose, the next man takes it. They are so bewitched with these two games, that they will loose sometimes all they have, Beaver, Moose-skinnes, Kettles, Wampompeage, Mowhackies, Hatchets, Knives, all is con|fiscate by these two games. For their sports of acti|vitie they have commonly but three or foure; as footeball, shooting, running and swimming: when they play country against country, there are rich Goales, all behung with Wampompeage, Mowhackies, Beaver skins, and blacke Ot|ter skinnes. It would exceede the beleefe of many to re|late the worth of one Goale, wherefore it shall be namelesse. Their Goales be a mile long placed on the sands, which are as even as a board; their ball is no bigger than a hand-ball, which sometimes they mount in the Aire with their naked feete, sometimes it is swayed by the multitude; sometimes also it is two dayes before they get a Goale, then they marke the ground they winne, and beginne there the next day. Before they come to this sport, they paint themselves, even as when they goe to warre, in pollicie to prevent future mischiefe, because no man should know him that moved his patience or accidentally hurt his person, ta|king away the occasion of studying revenge. Before they begin their armes be disordered, and hung upon some neigh|bouring tree, after which they make a long scrowle on the sand, over which they shake loving hands, and with laugh|ing hearts scuffle for victorie. While the men play the boyes pipe, and the women dance and sing trophies of their husbands conqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">sts; all being done a feast summons their departure. It is most delight to see them play, in smaller companies, when men may view their swift footemanship, their curious tossings of their Ball, their flouncing into the water, their lubberlike wrestling, having no cunning at all in that kind, one <HI>English</HI> being able to beate ten <HI>Indians</HI> at
<PB N="87" REF="50">
footeball. For their shooting they be most desperate marks|men for a point blancke object, and if it may bee possible <HI>Cornicum oculos configere</HI> they will doe it: such is their ce|lerity and dexterity in Artillerie, that they can smite the swift running Hinde and nimble winked Pigeon without a standing paule or left eyed blinking; they draw their Ar|rowes between the fore fingers and the thumbe; their bowes be quicke, but not very strong, not killing above six or sea|ven score. These men shoot at one another, but with swift conveighance shunne the Arrow; this they doe to make them expert against time of warre. It hath beene often admired how they can finde their Arrowes, be the weedes as high as themselves, yet they take such perfect notice of the flight and fall that they seldome loose any. They are trained up to their bowes even from their childhood; little boyes with Bowes made of little stickes and Arrowes of great bents, will smite downe a peece of Tobacco pipe every shoot a good way off: as these <HI>Indians</HI> be good markemen, so are they well experienced where the very life of every creature lyeth, and know where to smite him to make him dye pre|sently. For their swimming it is almost naturall, but much perfected by continuall practise; their swimming is not af|ter our <HI>English</HI> fashion of spread armes and legges which they hold too tiresome, but like dogges their armes before them cutting through the liquids with their right shoulder; in this manner they swimme very swift and farre, either in rough or smooth waters, sometimes for their ease lying as still as a log; sometimes they will play the dive-doppers, and come up in unexpected places. Their children likewise be taught to swimme when they are very yong. For their running it is with much celeritie and continuance, yet I sup|pose there be many <HI>English</HI> men who being as lightly clad as they are, would outrun them for a spurt, though not able to continue it for a day or dayes, being they be very strong winded and rightly clad for a race.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. Of their huntings.</HEAD>
<P>FOr their hunting, it is to be noted that they have no swift foote Grayhounds, to let slippe at the sight of the Deere, no deepe mouthed hounds, or senting beagles, to finde out their desired prey; themselves are all this, who in that time of the yeere, when the Deere comes downe, having certaine hunting houses, in such places where they know the Deere usually doth frequent, in which they keep their randevowes, their snares and all their accoutraments for that imploy|ment: when they get sight of a Deere, Moose or Beare, they studie how to get the wind of him, and approaching within shot, stab their marke quite through, if the bones hinder not. The chiefe thing they hunt after is Deere, Mooses, and Beares, it greeves them more to see an <HI>English</HI> man take one Deere, than a thousand Acres of land: they hunt likewise after Wolves, and wild Catts, Rackoones, Otters, Beavers, Mus|quashes, trading both their skinnes and flesh to the <HI>English.</HI> Besides their artillery, they have other devices to kill their game, as sometimes hedges a mile or two miles long, being a mile wide at one end, and made narrower and narrower by degrees, leaving onely a gap of sixe foote long, over against which, in the day time they lye lurking to shoot the Deere which come through that narrow gut; so many as come within the circumference of that hedge, seldome returne backe to leape over, unlesse they be forced by the chasing of some ravenous Wolfe, or sight of some accidentatall pas|singer; in the night at the gut of this hedge, they set Deere traps, which are springes made of young trees, and smooth wrought coards; so strong as it will tosse a horse if hee be caught in it. An <HI>English</HI> Mare being strayed from her ow|ner, and growne wild by her long sojourning in the Woods ranging up and downe with the wilde crew, stumbled into one of these traps which stopt her speed, hanging her like <HI>Mahomets</HI> tombe, betwixt earth and heaven; the morning b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing come, the <HI>Indians</HI> went to looke what good successe their Venison trappes had brought them, but seeing such a
<PB N="89" REF="51">
long scutted Deere, praunce in their Merritotter, they bade her good morrow, crying out, what cheere what cheere <HI>Englishmans squaw</HI> horse; having no better epithite than to call her a woman horse, but being loath to kill her, and as fearefull to approach neere the friscadoes of her Iron heeles, they posted to the <HI>English</HI> to tell them how the case stood or hung with their <HI>squaw</HI> horse, who unhorsed their Mare, and brought her to her former tamenesse, which since hath brought many a good foale, and performed much good service. In these traps Deeres, Mooses, Beares, Wolves, Catts, and Foxes, are often caught. For their Beavers and Otters, they have other kinde of trappes, so ponderous as is unsup|portable for such creatures, the massie burthen whereof ei|ther takes them prisoners, or expells their breath from their squised bodyes. These kinde of creatures would gnaw the other kind of trappes asunder, with their sharpe teeth: these beasts are too cunning for the <HI>English,</HI> who seldome or ne|ver catch any of them, therefore we leave them to those skil|full hunters whose time is not so precious, whose experience bought-skill hath made them practicall and usefull in that particuler.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVI. Of their Fishings.</HEAD>
<P>OF their fishing, in this trade they be very expert, being experienced in the knowledge of all baites, fitting sun|dry baites for severall fishes, and diverse seasons; being not ignorant likewise of the removall of fishes, knowing when to fish in rivers, and when at rockes, when in Baies, and when at Seas: since the <HI>English</HI> came they be furnished with <HI>English</HI> hookes and lines, before they made them of their owne hempe more curiously wrought, of stronger materials than ours, hooked with bone hookes: but lazinesse drives them to buy more than profit or commendations winnes them to make of their owne; they make likewise ve|ry strong Sturgeon nets with which they catch Sturgeons of 12.14, and 16. some 18. foote long in the day time, in the
<PB N="90" REF="52">
night time they betake them to their Burtchen <HI>Cannows,</HI> in which they carry a forty fathome line, with a sharpe bear|ded dart, fastned at the end thereof; then lightning a blazing torch made of Burcthen rindes, they weave it too and againe by their <HI>Cannow</HI> side, which the Sturgeon much delighted with, comes to them tumbling and playing, turning up his white belly, into which they thrust their launce, his backe being impenetrable; which done they haile to the shore their strugling prize. They have often recourse unto the rockes whereupon the sea beates, in warme weather to looke out for sleepie Seales, whose oyle they much esteeme, using it for divers things. In summer they seldome fish any where but in salt, in winter in the fresh water and ponds; in frostie weater they cut round holes in the yce, about which they wil sit like so many apes, on their naked breeches upon the congealed yce, catching of Pikes, Pearches, Breames, and other sorts of fresh water fish.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. Of their Arts and Manufactures.</HEAD>
<P>OF their severall Arts and imployments, as first in dres|sing of all manner of skinnes, which they doe by scra|ping and rubbing, afterwards painting them with antique embroyderings in unchangeable colours, sometimes they take off the haire, especially if it bee not killed in season. Their bowes they make of a handsome shape, strung com|monly with the sinnewes of Mooses; their arrowes are made of young Elderne, feathered with feathers of Eagles wings and tailes, headed with brasse in shape of a heart or triangle, fastned in a slender peece of wood sixe or 8 inches long, which is framed to put loose in the pithie Elderne, that is bound fast for riving: their arrowes be made in this manner because the arrow might shake from his head and be left be|hind for their finding, and the pile onely remaine to gaule the wounded beast. Their cordage is so even, soft, and smooth, that it lookes more like silke than hempe; their Stur|geon netts be not deepe, nor above 30. or 40. foote long,
<PB N="91" REF="52">
which in ebbing low waters they stake fast to the ground, where they are sure the Sturgeon will come, never looking more at it, till the next low water. Their <HI>Cannows</HI> be made ei|ther of Pine-trees, which before they were acquainted with <HI>English</HI> tooles, they burned hollow, scraping them smooth with Clam-shels and Oyster-shels, cutting their out-sides with stone-hatchets: These Boates be not above a foot and a halfe, or two feete wide, and twenty foote long. Their other <HI>Can|nows</HI> be made of thinne Birch-rines, close-ribbed on the in-side with broad thinne hoopes, like the hoopes of a Tub; these are made very light, a man may carry one of them a mile, being made purposely to carry from River to River, and Bay to Bay, to shorten Land-passages. In these cockling fly-boates, where|in an <HI>English</HI> man can scarce sit without a fearefull tottering, they will venture to Sea, when an <HI>English</HI> Shallope dare not beare a knot of sayle; scudding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver the overgrowne waves as fast as a winde-driven Ship, being driven by their padles; be|ing much like battle doores; if a crosse wave (as is seldome) turne her keele up-side downe, they by swimming free her, and scramble into her againe.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII. Of their Language.</HEAD>
<P>OF their Language which is onely peculiar to themselves, not inclining to any of the refined tongues. Some have thought they might be of the dispersed <HI>Iewes,</HI> because some of their words be neare unto the <HI>Hebrew</HI>; but by the same rule they may conclude them to be some of the gleanings of all Na|tions, because they have words which sound after the <HI>Greeke, Latine, French,</HI> and other tongues: Their Language is hard to learne; few of the <HI>English</HI> being able to speake any of it, or capable of the right pronunciation, which is the chiefe grace of their tongue. They pronounce much after the Diphthongs, excluding <HI>L</HI> and <HI>R,</HI> which in our <HI>English</HI> Tongue they pro|nounce with as much difficulty, as most of the <HI>Dutch</HI> doe <HI>T</HI> and <HI>H,</HI> calling a Lobster a <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bstann.</HI> Every Countrey

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. Of their women, their dispositions, employments, usage by their husbands, their apparell, and modesty.</HEAD>
<P>TO satisfie the curious eye of women-readers, who o|therwise might thinke their sex forgotten, or not wor|thy a record, let them peruse these few lines, wherein they may see their owne happinesse, if weighed in the womans ballance of these ruder <HI>Indians,</HI> who scorne the tuterings of their wives, or to admit them as their equals, though their qualities and industrious deservings may justly claime the preheminence, and command better usage and more conju|gall esteeme, their persons and features being every way cor|respondent, their qualifications more excellent, being more loving, pittifull, and modest, milde, provident, and laborious than their lazie husbands. Their employments be many: First their building of houses, whose frames are formed like our garden-arbours, something more round, very strong and handsome, covered with close-wrought mats of their owne weaving, which deny entrance to any drop of raine, though it come both fierce and long, neither can the piercing North winde finde a crannie, through which he can conveigh his cooling breath, they be warmer than our <HI>English</HI> houses; at the top is a square hole for the smoakes evacuation, which in rainy weather is covered with a pluver; these bee such smoakie dwellings, that when there is good fires, they are not able to stand upright, but lie all along under the smoake, never using any stooles or chaires, it being as rare to see an <HI>Indian</HI> sit on a stoole at home, as it is strange to see an <HI>En|glish</HI> man sit on his heeles abroad. Their houses are smaller in the Summer, when their families be dispersed, by reason of heate and occasions. In Winter they make some fiftie or threescore foote long, fortie or fiftie men being inmates un|der one roofe; and as is their husbands occasion these poore tectonists are often troubled like snailes, to carrie their hou|ses on their backs sometime to fishing-places, other times to hunting-places, after that to a planting place, where it abides
<PB N="95" REF="54">
the longest: an other work is their planting of come, where|in they exceede our <HI>English</HI> husband-men, keeping it so cleare with their Clamme shell-hooes, as if it were a garden rather than a corne-field, not suffering a choaking weede to advance his audacious head above their infant corne, or an undermining worme to spoile his spurnes. Their corne being ripe, they gather it, and drying it hard in the Sunne, conveigh it to their barnes, which be great holes digged in the ground in forme of a brasse pot, seeled with rinds of trees, wherein they put their corne, covering it from the inquisitive search of their gurmandizing husbands, who would eate up both their allowed portion, and reserved seede, if they knew where to finde it. But our hogges ha|ving found a way to unhindge their barne doores, and robbe their garners, they are glad to implore their husbands helpe to roule the bodies of trees over their holes, to prevent those pioners, whose theeverie they as much hate as their flesh. An other of their employments is their Summer pro|cessions to get Lobsters for their husbands, wherewith they baite their hookes when they goe a fishing for Basse or Cod|fish. This is an every dayes walke, be the weather cold or hot, the waters rough or calme, they must dive sometimes over head and eares for a Lobster, which often shakes them by their hands with a churlish nippe, and bids them adiew. The tide being spent, they trudge home two or three miles, with a hundred weight of Lobsters at their backs, and if none, a hundred scoules meete them at home, and a hungry belly for two dayes after. Their husbands having caught a|ny fish, they bring it in their boates as farre as they can by water, and there leave it; as it was their care to catch it, so it must be their wives paines to fetch it home, or fast: which done, they must dresse it and cooke it, dish it, and present it, see it eaten over their shoulders; and their loggerships ha|ving filled their paunches, their sweete lullabies scramble for their scrappes. In the Summer these <HI>Indian</HI> women when Lobsters be in their plenty and prime, they drie them to keepe for Winter, erecting scaffolds in the hot sun-shine, making fires likewise underneath them, by whose smoake
<PB N="96" REF="55">
the flies are expelled, till the substance remain hard and drie. In this manner they drie Basse and other fishes without salt, cutting them very thinne to dry suddainely, before the flies spoile them, or the raine moist them, having a speciall care to hang them in their smoakie houses, in the night and dan|kish weather.</P>
<P>In Summer they gather flagges, of which they make Matts for houses, and Hempe and Rushes, with dying stuffe of which they make curious baskets with intermixed co|lours and portractures of antique Imagerie: these baskets be of all sizes from a quart to a quarter, in which they carry their luggage. In winter time they are their hubands Cate|rers, trudging to the Clamm bankes for their belly timber, and their Porters to lugge home their Venison which their lazinesse exposes to the Woolves till they impose it upon their wives shoulders. They likewise sew their husbands shooes, and weave coates of Turkie feathers, besides all their ordinary household drudgerie which daily lies upon them, so that a bigge bellie hinders no businesse, nor a childebirth takes much time, but the young Infant being greased and sooted, wrapt in a Beaver skin, bound to his good behavi|our with his feete up to his bumme, upon a board two foote long and one foot broade, his face exposed to all nipping weather; this little <HI>Pappouse</HI> travells about with his bare footed mother to paddle in the Icie Clammbankes after three or foure dayes of age have sealed his pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">board and his mothers recoverie. For their carriage it is very civill, smiles being the greatest grace of their mirth; their musick is lullabies to quiet their children, who generally are as quiet as if they had neither spleene or lungs. To heare one of these <HI>Indians</HI> unseene, a good care might easily mistake their untaught voyce for the warbling of a well tuned in|strument. Such command have they of their voices. These womens modesty drives them to weare more cloathes than their men, having alwayes a coate of cloath or skinnes wrapt like a blanket about their loynes, reaching downe to their hammes which they never put off in company. If a husband have a minde to sell his wives Beaver, petticote, as
<PB N="97" REF="55">
sometimes he doth, shee will not put it off untill shee have another to put on: commendable is their milde carriage and obedience to their husbands, notwithstanding all this their customarie churlishnesse and salvage inhumanitie, not see|ming to delight in frownes or offering to word it with their lords, not presuming to proclaime their female superiority to the usurping of the least title of their husbands charter, but rest themselves content under their helplesse condition, coun|ting it the womans portion: since the <HI>English</HI> arrivall com|parison hath made them miserable, for seeing the kind usage of the <HI>English</HI> to their wives, they doe as much condemne their husbands for unkindnesse, and commend the <HI>English</HI> for their love. As their husbands commending themselves for their wit in keeping their wives industrious, doe con|demne the <HI>English</HI> for their folly in spoyling good working creatures. These women resort often to the <HI>English</HI> houses, where <HI>pares cum paribus congregatae,</HI> in Sex I meane, they do somewhat ease their miserie by complaining and seldome part without a releefe: If her husband come to seeke for his <HI>Squaw</HI> and beginne to bluster, the <HI>English</HI> woman be|takes her to her armes which are the warlike Ladle, and the scalding liquors, threatning blistering to the naked runna|way, who is soone expelled by such liquid comminations. In a word to conclude this womans historie, their love to the <HI>English</HI> hath deserved no small esteeme, ever presenting them some thing that is either rare or desired, as Strawber|ries, Hurtleberries, Rasberries, Gooseberries, Cherries, Plummes, Fish, and other such gifts as their poore treasury yeelds them. But now it may be, that this relation of the churlish and inhumane behaviour of these ruder <HI>Indians</HI> towards their patient wives, may confirme some in the be|liefe of an aspersion, which I have often heard men cast up|on the <HI>English</HI> there, as if they should learne of the <HI>Indians</HI> to use their wives in the like manner, and to bring them to the same subjection, as to sit on the lower hand, and to carrie water, and the like drudgerie: but if my owne experience may out-ballance an ill-grounded scandalous rumour, I doe assure you, upon my credit and reputation, that there is no
<PB N="98" REF="56">
such matter, but the women finde there as much love, re|spect, and ease, as here in old <HI>England.</HI> I will not deny, but that some poore people may carrie their owne water, and doe not the poorer sort in <HI>England</HI> doe the same, witnesse your <HI>London</HI> Tankerd-bearers, and your countrie-cottagers? But this may well be knowne to be nothing, but the rance|rous venome of some that beare no good will to the plan|tation. For what neede they carrie water, seeing every one hath a Spring at his doore, or the Sea by his house? Thus much for the satisfaction of women, touching this en|trenchment upon their prerogative, as also concerning the relation of these <HI>Indian</HI> Squawes.</P>
