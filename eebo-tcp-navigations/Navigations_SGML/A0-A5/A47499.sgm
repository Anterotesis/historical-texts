<HEAD>A Modern Account OF SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>_IF all our <HI>European</HI> Travellers direct their cour&s;e to <HI>Italy,</HI> upon the account of its Antiquity, why &s;hould <HI>Scotland</HI> be neg|lected, who&s;e wrinkled &s;urface derives its original from the Chaos? The fir&s;t In|habitants were &s;ome Straglers of the fallen Angels, who re&s;ted them&s;elves on the Confines, till their Captain <HI>Lucifer</HI> provided places for them in his own Countrey. This is the conjecture of Learned Criticks, who trace things to their Originals; and this opinion was grounded on the Devils Bratts yet re&s;ident among&s;t them, (who&s;e fore-&s;ight in the events of good and evil, exceeds the Oracles at <HI>Delphos</HI>) the &s;up|po&s;ed I&s;&s;ue of tho&s;e Pri&s;tine Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Names of Countrys were not then in fa&s;hion, tho&s;e came not in till <HI>Adam</HI>'s days, and Hi&s;tory (being then in her Infancy) makes no mention of the changes of that re|nowned Country, in that Interval betwixt him and <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> when their Chronicle commences, &s;he was then Baptized (and mo&s;t think with the &s;ign of the Cro&s;s) by the Vene|rable
<PB N="2" REF="3"> name of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from <HI>Scota,</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Pharaoh</HI> K. of <HI>Egypt.</HI> Hence came the ri&s;e and name of the&s;e pre&s;ent Inhabitants, as their Chronicle informs us, and is not to be doubted of, from divers con&s;iderable circum&s;tances; the Plagues of <HI>Egypt</HI> being entailed upon them, that of <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> (being a Judgment unrepealed) is an ample te&s;timony, the&s;e loving Animals accompanied them from <HI>Egypt,</HI> and remain with them to this day, never for&s;aking them (but as Rats leave a Hou&s;e) till they tumble into their Graves. The Plague of <HI>Biles</HI> and <HI>Blains</HI> is hereditary to them, as a di&s;tingui&s;hing mark from the re&s;t of the World, which (like the Devils cloven Hoof) warns all men to beware of them. The Judgment of Hail and Snow is naturalized and made free Deni&s;on here, and continues with them from the Suns fir&s;t ingre&s;s into <HI>Aries,</HI> till he has pa&s;&s;ed the 30th. degree of <HI>Aquary.</HI></P>
<P>The Plagues of Darkne&s;s was &s;aid to be thick darkne&s;s, to be felt, which mo&s;t undoubtedly the&s;e people have a &s;hare in, as the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> (Darkne&s;s) implies; the darkne&s;s being appliable to their gro&s;s and blocki&s;h under|&s;tandings (as I had it from a Scholar of their own Nation) Upon the&s;e grounds this Original is undeniably allowed them, and the Country it &s;elf (in <HI>Pyramid</HI>'s) re&s;embles <HI>Egypt,</HI> but far exceeds them both in bulk and number; theirs are but the Products of mens labours, but the&s;e are Natures own handy-work; and if <HI>Atlas</HI> wou'd ea&s;e a &s;houlder, here he may be &s;itted with a &s;upporter.</P>
<P><HI>Italy</HI> is compared to a Leg, <HI>Scotland</HI> to a Lou&s;e, who&s;e legs and engrailed edges repre&s;ent the Promontories and buttings out into the Sea, with more nooks and angles than the mo&s;t conceited of my Lord Mayors Cu&s;tards; nor does the compari&s;on determine here: A Lou&s;e preys upon its own Fo&s;terer and Pre&s;erver, and is productive of tho&s;e Minute-Animals called Nitts; &s;o <HI>Scotland,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Probo&s;cis</HI> joyns too clo&s;e to <HI>England,</HI> has &s;uckt away the nutriment from <HI>Northumberland,</HI> as the Countrey it &s;elf is too true a

<P>The Arms of the Kingdom was anciently a Red Lyon Rampant in a Field of Gold, but <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 787. they had the Augmentation of the double Tre&s;hure, for a&s;&s;i&s;ting the French King; but his Maje&s;ties Arms in <HI>Scotland</HI> is a more <HI>Hy&s;teron Proteron,</HI> the Pride of the people being &s;uch, as to place the <HI>Scots</HI> Arms in the dexter quarter of the E&s;cutcheon, and make the Unicorn the dexter Supporter, with the Thi&s;tle at his he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">l, with a &s;uitable Motto, <HI>Nemo me impun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> lace&s;&s;it,</HI> true enough; whoever deals with them &s;hall be &s;ure to &s;mart fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2+ letters">: The Thi&s;tle was wi&s;ely placed there, partly to &s;hew the fertility of the Countrey, Na|ture alone producing plenty of the&s;e gay Flowers, and partly as an emblem of the people, the top thereof having &s;ome colour of a flower, but the bulk and &s;ub&s;tance of it, is only &s;harp, and poy&s;onous pricks.</P>
<P>Woods they have none, that &s;uits not with the fruga|lity of the people, who are &s;o far from propagating any, that they de&s;troy tho&s;e they had upon this politick State Maxim, That Corn will not grow on the Land pe&s;tered with its Roots, and their branches harbour Birds, Animals above their humble conver&s;ation, that exceeds not that of Hornle&s;s <HI>Quadrupedes;</HI> ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1+ letters">y perhaps &s;ome of their Hou&s;es lurk under the &s;helter of a plump of Trees (the Birds not daring &s;o high a pre&s;umption) like <HI>Hugh Peters</HI> Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">s in her Maje&s;ty, or an Owl in an Ivy bu&s;h. Some Firr-woods there are in the High-lands, but &s;o inacce&s;&s;ible, that they &s;erve for no other u&s;e than Dens for tho&s;e ravenous Wolves with two hands, that prey upon their Neighbourhood, and &s;hel|ter them&s;elves under this Covert; to whom the &s;ight of a Stranger is as &s;urprizing as that of a Cockatrice. The Vallies for the mo&s;t part are covered with <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">r,</HI> or <HI>Bige,</HI> and the Hills with Snow; and as in the Northern Countries the Bears and Foxes change their Coats into the livery of the
<PB N="4" REF="4"> &s;oyle, &s;o here the Moor-Fowl (called Termagants) turn white, to &s;ute the &s;imple, though the Inhabitants &s;till &s;tand to their Aegyptian Flue.</P>
<P>They are freed from the charge and incumbrance of En|clo&s;ures, the whole being but one large Wa&s;te, &s;urrounded with the Sea: Indeed in many places you may &s;ee half a Rood of Land divided with an Earthen Bank, into many differing Apartments, according to the quality of Bea&s;ts that are to po&s;&s;e&s;s them.</P>
<P>The whole Countrey will make up a Park, Forre&s;t, or Chace, as you'l plea&s;e to call it; but if you de&s;ire an Ac|count of particular Parks, they are innumerable, every &s;mall Hou&s;e having a few Sodds thrown into a little Bank about it, and this for the &s;tate of the bu&s;ine&s;s (for&s;ooth) mu&s;t be called a Park, though not a Pole of Land in't.</P>
<P>If the Air was not pure and well refined by its agitation, it wou'd be &s;o infected with the &s;tinks of their Towns, and the &s;teams of the na&s;ty Inhabitants, that it would be pe&s;ti|lentful and de&s;tructive; indeed it is too thin for their gro&s;s &s;ences, that mu&s;t be fed with &s;uitable Viands, their Meat not affecting their di&s;tempered pallats, without it have a damnable hogoe, nor mu&s;ick their Ears without loud and har&s;h di&s;cord, and their No&s;trils (like a Jews) chiefly de|light in the perceptible effluviums of an old Sir R &mdash;</P>
<P>Fowl are as &s;carce here as Birds of Paradi&s;e, the Charity of the Inhabitants denying harbour to &s;uch Cele&s;tial Ani|mals, though Gulls and Cormorants abound, there being a greater &s;ympathy betwixt them. There is one &s;ort of ra|venous Fowl among&s;t them that has one web foot, one foot &s;uited for Land, and another for Water; but whe|ther or no this Fowl (being particular to this Countrey) be not the lively picture of the Inhabitants, I &s;hall leave to wi&s;er conjectures.</P>
<P>Their Rivers, or rather Arms of the Sea are &s;hort, few places in <HI>Scotland</HI> being above a days Journey from the Sea, but they are broad, deep, and dangerous, pe&s;tered with
<PB N="5" REF="4"> multitudes of Porpo&s;es or Sharks (&s;ome of them perhaps amphibious too, that live more on Land than Water) which de&s;troy their Salmon, the great Commodity of this Coun|trey, which being too good for the Inhabitants, are bar|reled up and converted into Merchandize, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Banks and borders of the&s;e Rivers (e&s;pecially near their Towns) are adorned with hardy Amazons, though inverted, their valour being (chiefly) from the wa&s;te downwards, which parts they readily expo&s;e to all the dangers of a naked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">encounter. The exerci&s;e of their Arms, I &s;hou'd &s;ay Feet, is much about Linnen; Sheets are &s;ufferers, a fit receiver is provided (not unlike a &s;hallow Pulpit to mind them of their Idol Sermons) wherein foul Linnen is laid to &s;uffer per&s;ecution, &s;o they turn up all, and tuck them about the their wa&s;ts, and bounce into a Buck-tub, then go their &s;tock, and belabour poor Lint till there be not a dry thread on't. Hence came the invention of Fulling-Mills, the Wo|men taught the Men, and they put in practice.</P>
<P>The Country is full of Lakes and Loughs, and they well &s;tockt with I&s;lands, &s;o that a Map thereof, looks like a Pil|lory Coat be&s;pattered all over with Dirt and rotten Eggs, &s;ome pieces of the &s;hells floating here and there, repre|&s;enting the I&s;lands.</P>
<P>Their Cattle are only repre&s;entatives of what are in o|ther Countreys, the&s;e being &s;o Epitomized, that it is hard to know what <HI>Cla&s;s</HI> they relate to. Their Hor&s;es are har|dy, and not without Gall (as &s;ome &s;ay other Hor&s;es are) u&s;ing both tooth and nail to mi&s;chief you; that they may not u&s;e more &s;tate than their Ma&s;ters, they go Bare-foot, which pre&s;erves them from the Gout; and if <HI>Hudibra&s;&s;es</HI> Hor&s;e had been of this race, he had not needed a Corn-cutter: Their Furniture or Harne&s;s is all of the &s;ame matter, all Wood from head to tail, Bridle, Saddle, Girths, Stirrups, and Crupper, all wood; nothing but a Withy will bind a Witch, and if the&s;e be called Witches, I &s;hall not oppo&s;e it, &s;ince by their untoward tricks one wou'd gue&s;s the
<PB N="6" REF="5"> Devil to be in them; their Bridles have not Bitts, but a kind of Mu&s;roll of two pieces of wood; their Crupper is a &s;tick of a yards length, put cro&s;s their docks, both ends thereof being tyed with woven wood to the Saddle. Their Bed and Board too is all of a &s;ame dry Straw, and when they have it up, whip on Harne&s;s and away. Their Neat are Hornle&s;s, the Owners claiming &s;ole propriety in tho&s;e Ornaments, nor &s;hould I deny them their Necklace too, for me-thinks that hoi&s;ted wood wou'd mightily be|come them. Their Sheep too have the &s;ame preferment, they are coupled together near their Ma&s;ters Palace. Some Animals they have by the name of Hogs, but more like Porcupines, bri&s;tled all over, and the&s;e are likewi&s;e fa&s;tned to the Free-hold by the former Artifice; all their Quadrupedes (Dogs only excepted, in which &s;ort they much abound) are honoured with wooden Bracelets a|bout their Necks, Legs, or Arms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Their Cities are poor and populous, e&s;pecially <HI>Edenbo|rough,</HI> their Metropolis, which &s;o well &s;uits with the Inha|bitants, that one Character will &s;erve them both, <HI>viz.</HI> High and Dirty. The Hou&s;es mount &s;even or eight &s;tories high, with many Families on one Floor, one Room being &s;ufficient for all occa&s;ions, eating, drinking, &s;leeping, and &s;hit&mdash;The mo&s;t mannerly &s;tep but to the door, and ne&s;t upon the Stairs. I have been in an I&s;land where it was dif|ficult to tread without breaking an Egg; but to move here, and not murder a T&mdash;is next to an impo&s;&s;ibility; the whole pavement is Pilgrim-&s;alve, mo&s;t excellent to li|quor Shooes withal, and &s;oft and ea&s;ie for the bare-foot Perambulators. The Town is like a double Comb (an Engine not commonly known among&s;t them) one great Street, and each &s;ide &s;tockt with narrow Allies, which I mi&s;took for Common-&s;hores; but the more one &s;tirs in a T&mdash; the more it will &s;tink. The other Cities and Towns are Copies from this Original, and therefore need no Commentators to explain them; they have &s;even Colledges
<PB N="7" REF="5"> (or rather Schools) in four Univer&s;ities; the Regents wear what colour'd Cloaths or Gowns they plea&s;e, and com|monly no Gowns at all, &s;o that it is hard to di&s;tingui&s;h a Scholar from an ordinary Man, &s;ince their Learning &s;hines not out of their No&s;es; the younger Students wear Scar|let Gowns only in Term time; their Re&s;idence is common|ly in the Town, only at School-hours they convene in the Colledge to con&s;ult their Oracle <HI>Buchanan;</HI> their chief Studies are for Pulpit-preferment, to prate out four or five Gla&s;&s;es with as much ea&s;e as drink them; and this they attain to in their &s;tripling years, commencing Mr. of Arts (that is meant onely Mr. of this Art) before one wou'd judge them fit for the Colledge; for as &s;oon as they can walk as fas as the School (which they will do very young, for like Lapwings they run with &s;hells on their heads) they are &s;ent thither, where they find no Benches to &s;it on (only one for the Mr.) but have a little Heath and Fadder &s;trewed for them to lye upon, where they litter together, and chew the Cud on their Fathers Horn-books, and in good time are preferred to the Bible; from this petty School away with them to the Grammar School, <HI>viz.</HI> the Colledge where in three or four years time they attain to (their <HI>ne plus ultra</HI>) the degree of A. M. that is, they can <HI>extempore,</HI> coin Graces and Prayers for all occa&s;ions; if you crack a Nut, there is a Grace for that, drink a di&s;h of Coffee, Ale, or Wine, or what el&s;e, he pre&s;ently fur|ni&s;hes you with a Grace for the nonce; &s;o if you pare your Nails, go to Stool, or any other action of like importance, he can as ea&s;ily &s;uit you with a Prayer as draw on a Glove; and the wonder of all is, that this Prayer &s;hall be &s;o admi|rably framed, that it may indifferently quadrate with any occa&s;ion, an excellency no where &s;o common as in this Countrey. Thus you &s;ee the young man has commenced and got &s;trength enough to walk to the Kirk and enter the Chair, where we &s;hall find him anon, after we have viewed the out-&s;ides of their Kirks, &s;ome of which have been of
<PB N="8" REF="6"> Antient Foundations, and well and regularly built, but order and uniformity is in perfect Antipathy to the humour of this Nation, the&s;e goodly Structures being either wholly de&s;troyed (as at St. <HI>Andrews</HI> and <HI>Elgin,</HI> where by the re|maining Ruins you may &s;ee what it was in perfection) or very much defaced; they make u&s;e of no Quires, tho&s;e are either quite pulled down, or converted into another Kirk, for it is common here to have three, four, or five Kirks under one Roof, which being pre&s;erved entire, wou'd have made one good Church, but they cou'd not then have had Preaching enough in it: Out of one Pulpit now they have thirty Sermons <HI>per</HI> week, all under one Roof, plenty of Spiritual provi&s;ion which gu&s;ts much better with a mix|ture of the fle&s;h; as you may gue&s;s by their Stools of Re|pentance in every Kirk, well furni&s;hed with Whore-mon|gers and Adulterers of both Sexes. In <HI>Venice,</HI> the &s;hadows only of Curtezans are expo&s;ed to publick view only in Effigie, but here the Whore in per&s;on has a high place pro|vided her in the view of the whole Congregation for the be|nefit of Strangers, who (&s;ome think) need not this direction, but may truck for all Commodities with the fir&s;t they meet with. They u&s;e no Service-Book, nor Whore of <HI>Babylons</HI> Smock (as they term a Surplice) nor decency, nor order in their divine or rather contumelious Service. Wou'd a King think him&s;elf honoured by Subjects, that Petitioned him with bonet valed, but cockt his Cap the while his re|que&s;t was granting, while precious Mr. <HI>Presbyter,</HI> grimaces, prays or houls, the Mon&s;ter Rabble vails; but as &s;oon as Text is taken, Blew-bonnet takes place again, and this Pulpit-prater is e&s;teemed more than Gods Amba&s;&s;ador, having the holy Spirit at his beck to prompt him every word he &s;peaks, yet not three &s;entences of &s;ence together, &s;uch Bla&s;phemy as I blu&s;h to mention.</P>
<P>Their Chri&s;tnings (as all other things) are without form, only water poured on the Infant, and &s;uch words u&s;ed as Sir <HI>John</HI>'s <HI>Mephi&s;tophilus</HI> &s;upplies him with, and &s;o the
<PB N="9" REF="6"> Child commences Chri&s;tian, as good (or better) than the be&s;t of them. Some think Marriage an unnece&s;&s;ary thing among&s;t them, it being more generous and u&s;ual among&s;t them to take one anothers words; however 'tis thus per|formed, The young Couple being attended with Tagrag and Bobtail, gang to Kirk, where Mr. <HI>Scruple</HI> (like a good Ca&s;ui&s;t) controverts the point in hand to them, and Schools Mr. Bridegroom in his Le&s;&s;on, then directs his di&s;|cour&s;e to Mrs. Bride, who being the weaker Ve&s;&s;el, ought to have the more pains taken with her; he chalks out the way &s;he is to walk in, in all its particulars, and joyns their hands, and then let them fall to on Gods name: Home they go with loud ravi&s;hing Bag-pipes, and dance about the Green, 'till they part by Couples to Repetition, and &s;o put the rules in practice, and perhaps Sr. <HI>Roger</HI> follows Mrs. Bride to her Apartment, to &s;atisfie her doubts, where he u&s;es &s;uch pungent and pre&s;&s;ing Arguments, as &s;he never forgets as long as &s;he lives.</P>
<P>When any one dies, the Bell-man goes about ringing their pa&s;&s;ing Bell, and acquaints the people therewith, in form following, <HI>Beloved Brouthrin and Su&s;ters, I let you to wot that thir is an fauthful Broothir lawtli departed awt of this pri&s;ant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">arld, aut thi ple&s;uir of Aulmoughti Good</HI> (and then he vails his Bonnet) <HI>his Naum is</HI> Volli Voodcock, <HI>thrid Son to</HI> Jimmoy Voodcok <HI>a Cordinger; he ligs aut thi &s;ext door vethin thi Nord Gawt, clo&s;e on thi Nawthwr Rawnd, and I wod yaw gang to hus burying on</HI> Thru&s;dan <HI>before twa a Cloak,</HI> &amp;c.

<PB N="10" REF="7"> perhaps in one part of it their Court of Judicature are kept; in another are Butts to &s;hoot at for Recreation. All agree that a Womans tongue is the la&s;t member &s;he moves but the Latin Proverb, <HI>mulieri ne credas,</HI> &amp;c. &s;eems to prove it after death: I am &s;ure the pride of this People never leaves them, but follows them to their long homes (I was about to have &s;aid, to the Devil) for the meane&s;t man mu&s;t have a Grave-&s;tone full fraught with his own prai&s;es (though he was the vile&s;t Mi&s;creant on Earth) and mi&s;era|ble <HI>memento mori's,</HI> both in Engli&s;h and Latin, nay Greek too, if they can find a Greek word for <HI>Cordinger,</HI> the Calling he was of, and all this in &s;uch mi&s;erable Scotch Ortho|graphy, that 'tis hard to di&s;tingui&s;h one Language from another.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tles of defence in this Countrey are almo&s;t im|pregnable, only to be taken by Treachery or long Siege, their Water failing them &s;oone&s;t; they are built upon high and almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible Rocks, only one forc'd pa&s;&s;age up to them, &s;o that a few Men may ea&s;ily defend them. In|deed all the Gentlemens Hou&s;es are &s;trong Ca&s;tles, they being &s;o Treacherous one to another, that they are forced to defend them&s;elves in &s;trong holds; they are commonly built upon &s;ome &s;ingle Rock in the Sea, or &s;ome high Pre|cipice near the Mid-land, with many Towers and &s;trong Iron Grates before their Windows (the lower part where|of, is only a woodden &s;hutter, and the upper part gla&s;s) &s;o that they look more like Pri&s;ons than Hou&s;es of Reception; &s;ome few Hou&s;es there are of late erection, that are built in a better form, with good Walks and Gardens about them, but their Fruit rarely comes to any perfection. The Hou&s;es of the Commonalty are very mean, Mud-wall and Thatch the be&s;t; but the poorer &s;ort live in &s;uch mi&s;erable Hutts as never eye beheld, it is no difficulty to pi&s;s over them; Men, Women, and Children pigg altogether in a poor Mou&s;e-hole of Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">, Heath, and &s;uch like matter, in &s;ome parts where Turf is plentiful; they build up little Cabbins
<PB N="11" REF="7"> with Arched Roofs of Turf, without a &s;tick of Timber in it; when the Hou&s;e is dry enough to burn, it &s;erves them for Fuel, and they remove to another. The Habit of the People is very different, according to the qualities or the places they live in, as Low-land or High-land Men. The Low-land Gentry go well enough habited, but the poorer &s;ort go (almo&s;t) naked, only an old Cloak, or a part of their Bed-cloaths thrown over them. The Highlanders wear &s;la&s;hed Doublets, commonly without Breeches, only a Plad tyed about their Wa&s;ts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> thrown over one &s;houlder, with &s;hort Stockings to the Gartering place, their knees and part of their thighs being naked; others have Breeches and Stockings all of a piece of Plad ware, clo&s;e to their thighs; in one &s;ide of their Girdle &s;ticks a Durk or Skean, about a foot or half a yard long, very &s;harp, and the back of it filed into divers notches, wherein they put Poy&s;on; on the other &s;ide a brace (at lea&s;t) of bra&s;s Pi&s;tols; nor is this Honour &s;ufficient, if they can purcha&s;e more, they mu&s;t have a long &s;winging Sword.</P>
<P>The Women are commonly two-handed tools, &s;trong-po&s;ted Timber, they di&s;like Engli&s;h men becau&s;e they have no leggs, or (like them&s;elves) po&s;ts to walk on; the meaner go bare-foot and bare-head, with two black Elflocks on ei|ther &s;ide their faces; &s;ome of them have &s;carce any Cloaths at all, &s;ave part of their Bed-cloaths pinn'd about their &s;houlders, and their Children have nothing el&s;e on them but a little Blanket; tho&s;e Women that can purcha&s;e Plads, need not be&s;tow much upon other Cloaths, the&s;e Cover-&s;luts being &s;ufficient. Tho&s;e of the be&s;t &s;ort that are very well habited in their modi&s;h Silks, yet mu&s;t wear a Plad o|ver all for the Credit of their Countrey.</P>
<P>The people are Proud, Arrogant, Vain-glorious boa&s;ters, Bloody, Barbarous, and Inhuman Butchers. Couzenage and Theft is in perfection among&s;t them, and they are perfect Engli&s;h-haters, they &s;hew their pride in exalting them&s;elves and depre&s;&s;ing their Neighbours. When the Palace at
<PB N="12" REF="8"> <HI>Edenburgh</HI> is fini&s;hed, they expect his Maje&s;ty will leave his rotten Hou&s;e at <HI>White-Hall,</HI> and live &s;plendidly among&s;t his nown Countrey-men the <HI>Scots;</HI> for they &s;ay that Engli&s;h|men are very much beholden to them that we have their King among&s;t us. The Nobility and Gentry Lord it over their poor Tenants, and u&s;e them wor&s;e than Gally-&s;laves; they are all bound to &s;erve them, Men, Women, and Chil|dren; the fir&s;t Fruits is always the Landlords due, he is the Man that mu&s;t fir&s;t board all the young Married Women within his Laird&s;hip, and their Sons are all his Slaves, &s;o that any mean Laird will have 6 or 10. or more followers, be&s;ides tho&s;e of his own name, that are inferiour to him, mu&s;t all attend him (as he him&s;elf mu&s;t do his Superiour, of the &s;ame name, and all of them attend the Chief) if he receives a Stranger, all this train mu&s;t be at his beck Armed as afore|&s;aid; if you drink with them in a Tavern, you mu&s;t have all this Rubbi&s;h with you; and if you offend the Laird, his Durk &s;hall &s;oon be &s;heathed in your Belly, and after his, every one of his Followers, or they &s;hall &s;uffer them&s;elves that refu&s;e it, that &s;o they may be all alike guilty of the Mur|der: Every Laird (of note) hath a Gibbit near his Hou&s;e, and has power to Condemn and Hang any of his Va&s;&s;als; &s;o they dare not oppo&s;e him in any thing, but mu&s;t &s;ubmit to his Commands, let them be never &s;o unju&s;t and Tyranical. There are too many Te&s;timonies of their Cruelty among&s;t them&s;elves in their own Chronicles, 40 of their Kings have been Barbarou&s;ly Murdered by them, and half as many more have either made away them&s;elves for fear of their torturing of them, or have dyed mi&s;erably in &s;treight Im|pri&s;onment. What &s;trange Butcheries have been committed in their feuds, &s;ome of which are in agitation at this day, <HI>viz. Argile</HI> with the <HI>Macclanes,</HI> and <HI>Mac Donnels</HI> about <HI>Mula I&s;land,</HI> which has co&s;t already much blood, and is likely will co&s;t much more before it will be decided; their &s;pirits are &s;o mean, that they rarely Rob, but take away life fir&s;t, lying in Ambu&s;cade, they &s;end a brace of Bullets on Emba&s;&s;y
<PB N="13" REF="8"> through the Travellars body; and to make &s;ure work, they &s;heath their Durks in his livele&s;s trunk; perhaps to take off their fire edges, as new Knives are &s;tuck in a Bag-pudding. If an Highlander be injured, tho&s;e of his own name mu&s;t defend him, and will certainly have &s;atisfaction from the Offenders: A late in&s;tance whereof was at <HI>Inverne&s;s,</HI> (a con&s;iderable Town) where one of the <HI>Macdonnels</HI> was &s;lain, but &s;hortly the chief of the Name came down again&s;t the Town with 1500 Men of his own Name, and threatned to &s;ire the Town, but the Inhabitants compounded with them for 2000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>Their Cruelty de&s;cends to their Bea&s;ts, it being a cu&s;tom in &s;ome places to fea&s;t upon a living Cow they tye in the middle of them, near a great &s;ire, and then cut collops of this poor living Bea&s;t, and broil them on the fire, till they have mangled her all to pieces; nay, &s;ometimes they will only cut of as much as will &s;atisfie their pre&s;ent Appetites, and let her go till their greedy Stomacks calls for a new &s;upply; &s;uch horrible Cruelty as can fearce be parallel'd in the whole world! Their Theft is &s;o well known that it needs no proving, they are forced to keep Watch over all they have, to &s;ecure it; their Cattle are watch'd day and night, or o|therwi&s;e they wou'd be over-grown by morning. In the Highlands they do it publickly before the face of the Sun, if one Man has two Cows, and another wants, he &s;hall &s;oon &s;upply him&s;elf from his Neighbour, who can find no remedy for it. The Gentry keep an Armory in their own Hou&s;es, furni&s;h'd with &s;everal &s;orts of fire Arms, Pikes and Halbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ts, with which they Arm their followers, to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the Rapine of their Neighbourhood. The Lowland Language may be well enough under&s;tood by an Engli&s;h|man, but the Highlanders have a peculiar Lingua to them|&s;elves, which they call <HI>Er&s;t,</HI> unknown to mo&s;t of the Low|land men, except only in tho&s;e places that border on them, where they can &s;peak both: Yet the&s;e People are &s;o curri&s;h, that if a Stranger inquire the way in Engli&s;h, they will cer|tainly an&s;wer in <HI>Er&s;t,</HI> and find no other Language than what
<PB N="14" REF="9"> is forc'd from them with a Cudgel. If <HI>Cornelius Agrippa</HI> had travelled <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;ure Cookery had not been found in his Vanity of Sciences, &s;uch is their &s;ingular skill in this Art, that they may defie the world to rival them; King <HI>James</HI>'s Treat for the Devil, that is a Poll of Ling, a Joll of Sturgeon, and a Pigg, with a pipe of Tobacco for dige&s;tion, had been very compleat, if the ordering thereof had been a&s;&s;igned to a Cuke of this Countrey, who can &s;ute every di&s;h with its proper hogoe, and bring Corruption to your Table, only to mind Men of Mortality: Their Meat is Carrion when 'tis kill'd, but after it has been a Fortnight a perfuming with the Aromatick air, &s;trained through the calmy trunks of Fle&s;h flies, then it pa&s;&s;es the tryal of fire under the care of one of tho&s;e exqui&s;ite Arti&s;ts, and is di&s;h'd up in a Sea of &s;weet Scotch Butter, and &s;o cover'd and &s;erved hot up to the Table: O how happy is he that is placed next to it, with a priviledge to uncover it, and receive the hot &s;teams of this dainty di&s;h, almo&s;t &s;ufficient to cure all Di&s;tempers. It will be needle&s;s to in&s;tance in particulars &s;o plain and evident to all that have travell'd through the Countrey, that they may certainly bear away the Bell from all their Neighbouring Nations, or indeed from the whole world. Their Nobility and Gentry have Tables plentifully enough furni&s;h'd, but few or none of them have their Meat better order'd: To put ones head into their Kitchen-doors, is little le&s;s than de&s;tructive; to enter Hell alive, where the black Fairies are bu&s;ied in mangling dead Carca&s;es, and the Fire and Brim&s;tone, or rather &s;tew and &s;tinck, is ready to &s;uffo|cate you, and yet (which is &s;trange) the&s;e things are agree|able to the humours of the people. The Poorer &s;ort live of Haddock, Whiting, and &s;ower Milk, which is cryed up and down their Streets <HI>(Whea buyes &s;awer Milk)</HI> and up|on the &s;tinking Fragments that are left at their Lairds Ta|ble. Prodigious Stomacks, that like the <HI>Gulon,</HI> can feed on their own Excrements, and &s;train their Meat through their Stomacks, to have the pleau&s;e of devouring it again!</P>
<PB N="15" REF="9">
<P>Their Drink is Ale made of Beer-Malt, and &s;unned up in a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, called a Cogne; after it has &s;tood a few hours, they drink it out of the Cogne, Ye&s;t and all; the bet|ter &s;ort Brew it in larger quantities, and drink it in wooden Queighs, but it is &s;orry &s;tuff, yet excellent for preparing Birdlime; but Wine is the great drink with the Gentry, which they pour in like Fi&s;hes, as if it were their natural Element; the Gla&s;&s;es they drink out of, are con&s;iderably large, and they always fill them to the brim, and away with it; &s;ome of them have arrived at the perfection to tope Brandy at the &s;ame rate: &s;ure the&s;e are a Bowl above <HI>Bacchus,</HI> and of right ought to have a nobler Throne than a Hog&s;head.</P>
<P>Mu&s;ick they have, but not the Harmony of the Sphears, but loud terrene noi&s;es, like the bellowing of Bea&s;ts; the loud Bagpipe is their chief delight, Stringed In&s;truments are too &s;oft to penetrate the organs of their ears that are only plea&s;ed with &s;ounds of &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>The High-ways in <HI>Scotland</HI> are tolerably good, which is the greate&s;t comfort a Traveller meets with among&s;t them; they have not Inns, but Change hou&s;es (as they call them) poor &s;mall Cottages, where you mu&s;t be content to take what you find, perhaps Eggs with Chucks in them, and &s;ome Lang-Cale; at the better &s;ort of them, a di&s;h of chop'd Chickens, which they e&s;teem a dainty di&s;h, and will take it unkindly if you do not eat very heartily of it, though for the mo&s;t part you may make a Meal with the &s;ight of the Fare, and be &s;atisfied with the &s;team only, like the Inhabi|tants of the World in the Moon; your Hor&s;es mu&s;t be &s;ent to a Stablers (for the Change-hou&s;es have no Lodging for them) where they may feed voluptuou&s;ly on Straw only, for Gra&s;s is not to had, and Hay is &s;o much a Stranger to them, that they are &s;carce familiar with the name of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Scotch</HI> Gentry commonly travel from one Friends Hou&s;e to another, &s;o &s;eldom make u&s;e of a Change-hou&s;e; their way is to hire a Hor&s;e and a Man for two pence a
<PB N="16" REF="10"> Mile; they ride on the Hor&s;e 30 or 40 Miles a day, and the Man who is his Guide, foots it be&s;ide him, and carries his Luggage to boot. The be&s;t &s;ort keep only a Hor&s;e or two for them&s;elves and their be&s;t Friend, all the re&s;t of the train foot it be&s;ide them. The Commonalty are &s;o u&s;ed to wor|&s;hip and adore their Lairds, that when they &s;ee a Stranger in any tolerable equipage, they honour him with the title of Laird at lea&s;t, <HI>An't plea&s;e you my Laird &s;uch a one,</HI> or <HI>an't plea&s;e you my Laird D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> at every bare word for&s;ooth.</P>
<P>The Nobility &s;hew them&s;elves very great before Stran|gers, they are conducted into the Hou&s;e by a many of Ser|vants, where the Lord with his troop of Shadows receives them with the grand Paw, then enter into &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e of their Countrey, till you are pre&s;ented with a great Queigh of &s;yrrup of Beer, after that a gla&s;s of White-wine, then a Rummer of Claret, and &s;ometimes after that a gla&s;s of Sherry Sack, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> begin the round with Ale again, and ply you briskly, for it's their way of &s;hewing you'r Wel|come, by making you Drunk; if you have longer time to &s;tay, you &s;tick clo&s;e to Claret, till <HI>Bacchus</HI> wins the Field; and leaves the conquer'd Victims groveling on the place where they received their overthrow; at your departure you mu&s;t drink a <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ngha Doras,</HI> in Engli&s;h, a Stirrup cup, and have the &s;atisfaction to have my Lords Bagpipe (with his loud Pipes, with his Lord&s;hips Coat Armor on a Flag) &s;trut about you, and enchant you with a <HI>Loth to depart.</HI></P>
<P>Their Money is commonly <HI>Dollars,</HI> or Mark pieces, coined at <HI>Edenbrough,</HI> but their way of Reckoning is &s;ur|prizing to a Stranger; to receive a Bill of 100 <HI>l.</HI> in one of their Change-hou&s;e, when one wou'd not &s;uppo&s;e they had any of the value of 100 pence; they call a Penny a Shil|ling, and every 20 Shillings, <HI>viz.</HI> 20 pence, a Pound; &s;o the proportion of their Pound to ours is twelve to one. Stran|gers are &s;ure to be gro&s;ly impo&s;ed upon in all their Change-hou&s;es, and there is no redre&s;s for it: If an Engli&s;h-man &s;hou'd complain to their Magi&s;trates, they wou'd all
<PB N="17" REF="10"> take a part again&s;t him, and make &s;ure to &s;queze him.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of the Abridgment of the Scotch Chronicle, is the rare and wonderful things of that Countrey; as in <HI>Orkney,</HI> their Ews bring forth two Lambs a piece; that in the Northermo&s;t of <HI>Shetland</HI> I&s;lands, about the Summer Sol&s;lict, there is no Night; that in the Park of <HI>Cumbernaule</HI> are white Kine and Oxen; that at <HI>Slanes</HI> there is a putrifying water in a Cove; that at <HI>Aberdeen</HI> is a Vitriolin Well, that they &s;ay is excellent to di&s;&s;olve the Stone, and expel Sand from the Reins and Bladder, and good for the Colick, be|ing drunk in <HI>July,</HI> &amp;c. The&s;e Prodigious wonders in one Countrey are admirable, but the&s;e are not half of them. <HI>Lougne&s;s</HI> never freezes; in <HI>Lough Lommond</HI> are Fi&s;hes without &s;ins: And 2dly. The Waters thereof rage in great waves without Wind in calm weather: And 3dly. and la&s;tly, Therein is a floating I&s;land: In <HI>Kyle</HI> is a deaf Rock 12. foot every way, yet a Gun di&s;charged on one &s;ide of it, &s;hall not be heard to the other. In another place is a Rocking-&s;tone of a rea&s;onable bigne&s;s, that if a Man pu&s;h it with his finger, it will move very lightly, but if he addre&s;s his whole force, it availeth nothing; with many more marvels of like nature, which I wou'd rather believe than go thither to di&s;prove. To conclude the whole bulk and &s;elvedge of this Countrey, is all <HI>Wonder</HI> too great for me to unriddle, there I &s;hall leave it as I found it, with its agreeable Inha|tants in
<Q><L>A Land where one may pray with cur&s;t intent:</L>
<L>Oh! May they never &s;uffer Bani&s;hment.</L></Q></P>
