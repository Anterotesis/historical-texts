<HEAD>TRAVELS BEGUN Anno 1626. DE|SCRIBING DIVERS parts of <HI>Africk,</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia</HI> the Great; but principally the two famous Monarchies, the <HI>Mogull</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian.</HI> THE FIRST BOOK.</HEAD>
<P>_ALL things are the more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Indu|ction.</NOTE> mo&s;t things the better for Addition. In honour and wealth no fault is found with encrea&s;e; full meales &amp; full plea&s;ures too; brim-full have no guard upon them. The fuller the better: If the husbandry be&s;towed up|on this Book hath improv'd the &s;oile, &s;ince you view'd it la&s;t, the Lyme was yours and charge of bringing; the &s;preading only belongs to mee as your day-labourer.</P>
<P>To improve on your incouragement, is for your credit, my delight; both our benefits. The gale you late &s;o favourably lent me &s;pred my affection, and againe lancht me into another Ocean. And,
<Q>Turpe mihi abire domo, vacuum&abque; redire e&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>I know my new Relations mu&s;t endure the touch; yea, and the handling too. So &s;hould all Books: But in this Age it fares with Books as with French toyes, faire to the eyes, well coverd with your empty Gallants, who take the people with the out-&s;ide bravery; Give me good Lynings.</P>
<P>My minde is like my habit, plaine; and my expre&s;&s;ions (I hope &s;o) too. If my new thoughts have added to your bottom, I know you will unwinde gent|ly for feare of ravelling, and tie a knot where the thread breaks. But if I have made no Topographic mi&s;takes, I feare no other deviations.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t (the fruits of youth and ha&s;te) came abortive into your hands; and fail'd not of re&s;pective welcome. Yet in &s;o cold, &s;o nipping a Zone, more cloathing may be accepted of, and which I have woven with &s;ome toyle, but
<PB N="2" REF="7" MS="y">
very willingly, hoping it may di&s;cover more maturity. I formerly obeyed my friends, who thought the fir&s;t too &s;hort; this then may prove the happier, &s;ince I have laboured to give them a ready acknowledgement. Let my errors therefore reflect on them, and impale me in your favour, for peradventure I may give boldne&s;&s;e to your Factors, to fetch exotique rarities in a new divi&s;i|on of the world, and in a&s;&s;uring their Barques to bring you home, what may prove worthy your &s;ight and mony. But this lucky gale will &s;uffer no longer complement.</P>
<P>The relation of our Sea-voyage, is fir&s;t enjoyned me.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1626.</NOTE>VPon Good-Friday, we took &s;hip at <HI>Dover,</HI> having &s;ix great &amp; well-man'd &s;hips along with us. In few houres coa&s;ting clo&s;e by the Ile of <HI>Wight</HI> (call'd &s;o from <HI>Gwydh</HI> a Britti&s;h word &s;ignifying, &s;eene at di&s;tance; <HI>Vectis</HI> in <HI>Pliny, Vecta</HI> in <HI>Eutropius;</HI>) where, a &s;udden and violent gu&s;t a&s;&s;aulted us; which, after an houres rage, &s;pent it &s;elfe, and blew us the third day (double &s;olem|niz'd by being the fea&s;ts of Mother and Sonne) upon the Lizards point or lands end of <HI>England,</HI> the utmo&s;t promontory of <HI>Cornwall;</HI> and from whence, to the extreame&s;t cape of <HI>Afrique,</HI> wee compute our longitude, and not from the <HI>Azores</HI> the fir&s;t Meridian.</P>
<P>The wind blew faire, &s;o as the &s;even and twentieth day wee entred the Spa|ni&s;h Ocean, the coa&s;t of <HI>Bi&s;cay</HI> neighbouring us. Ere long, we de&s;cried &s;even tall &s;hips, whom reputing enemies, we bore up to &s;peake with, but they pro|ved friends, Hollanders out of the Levant, who drunk our healths as they pa&s;t, by a roring Culverin; and we vomited out a like eccho of thunder, plow|ing up the liquid Seas in merrine&s;&s;e, till the nine and twentieth day made us the &s;port of Danger, dancing upon the raging billowes, <HI>Aeolus</HI> from his iron whi&s;tle blu&s;tering melancholly tunes, a good while heaven and &s;ea &s;eeming undivided.

<P>Violence has no permanence; in thirty houres, the quarell 'twixt wind and &s;ea was ended, and joy in a &s;erene sky reanimated us, &s;o as wee ended March in cha&s;e of a Turki&s;h Pirat, whom with top-gallant top-&s;ailes we pur|&s;ued 6 houres, but (to our griefe) he out-&s;ailed us.

<P>And becau&s;e we have <HI>nilni&s;i pontus et Aer</HI> to ob&s;erve upon, let us theorize a little upon the Mathematiques. The Inhabitants within this Zone (the torrid) we are now in, are call'd <HI>Amphi&s;cij,</HI> in re&s;pect they ca&s;t their &s;hadowes both wayes according as the Sunne is in declination, and <HI>A&s;cij</HI> or &s;hadowle&s;&s;e, when <HI>Sol</HI>-is Zenith, from which point when it fleets either North or South the &s;hadow ever darts contrarily, as falls out when ever the gnomon or coela|ted body is interpo&s;ed. The <HI>peri&s;cij</HI> have their &s;hadow circulating, their meridionall &s;hadowes having no exi&s;tence from the vertice, but oblique and extended to the plaine of the terre&s;triall Horizon, glomerating the gnomon or body opacous; the&s;e &s;ort of people freezing within the polar circles (of like di&s;tance from the pole, the Tropicks are from the Aequinoctiall) the pole being their vertex, and Aequator (90 degrees) their direct Horizon. The <HI>Hete|ro&s;cij</HI> are &s;uch as live in the temperate Zone, who&s;e &s;hadowes at noone day turne but one way. And this the Mathematicks teach us, that the <HI>Hetero&s;cij</HI> comprehend 41 parellells, the <HI>Amphi&s;cij</HI> &s;even, the <HI>Peri&s;cij</HI> (tho&s;e in the fro|zen Zone) halfe the yeare.

The <HI>Antoeci</HI> are al&s;o oppo&s;ite, but vary neither in Meridian nor aequidi&s;tance from the Horizon, re&s;pecting either Hemi&s;phere.</P>
<P>The <HI>Antipodes</HI> are &s;uch as be feet to feet, a preci&s;e &s;traight line pa&s;&s;ing tho|row the Center from one &s;ide to another: differing fro~ the <HI>Periaeci</HI> by degrees of a &s;maller circle, whence we ob&s;erve, that &s;uch as be to us <HI>Periaeci,</HI> be <HI>Antoeci</HI> to our <HI>Antichthones,</HI> each inverted to other in a perfect contrary.

Let us view it as it was and is.</P>
<P>The Altitude of the pole here, is 27 degrees: and though it be with|out the torrid zone, yet what by the &s;ulphur of the earth, and oblique re|flex of the burning Sun, for foure moneths (from May to September) no place in the world is more hot or &s;calding; it is the cu&s;tome here to &s;leep in beds of rayne water, which is not very coole neither, all day naked: the City had a faire Bazzar, many Churches, and Frieries, brave Magazeens, &s;tately hou&s;es, and as gallant a ca&s;tle as any other in Orient; the ca&s;tle is yet in good &s;trength and repayre; the re&s;t, levelled with the ground; of which I cannot &s;ay, <HI>Nunc &s;eges ubi Troja fuit,</HI> the &s;oile being uncapable of corne or other graine: at that end again&s;t <HI>Dozar</HI> (and the great <HI>Bannyan</HI> tree in the continent) the City was built; where the &s;ea is &s;o narrow that a Cannon may ea&s;ily &s;pit over: the whole Ile exceeds not fifteene myles compa&s;&s;e: it is the mo&s;t barren ground in the world, neither tree nor &s;pring of good water could we find in it. It has &s;alt, &s;ilver &s;hining &s;and, and mine|ralls of &s;ulphur; has nothing el&s;e worth the looking on: And yet from the advantagious &s;tanding, the laborious Portugal made it the &s;taple and glory of the world; &s;ecured indeed by many naturall props, on all &s;ides com|manding Iles and townes to furni&s;h her: <HI>Larac</HI> (<HI>Azgillia</HI> of old) <HI>Ki&s;hmy</HI> (by &s;ome cald <HI>Quexome</HI> or <HI>Broict</HI>) <HI>Keys</HI> or <HI>Queys</HI> Ile, <HI>Angen, Andreve</HI> (or <HI>de los pa&s;haros</HI>) <HI>Kargh, Baharem</HI> (<HI>Icara</HI> in Pliny) <HI>Dozaro, Ia&s;ques,</HI> and <HI>Ko&s;tack</HI> in <HI>Marga&s;tan</HI> (now <HI>Moge&s;tan</HI>) vicinating them. So as to the eye of man no place could be more offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, garri&s;ons of Portu|galls ever lying in the&s;e Ilands; and yet, when the God of Nature had decreed a ruine, it could not be with&s;tood, but was in &s;ome regard mira|culou&s;ly effected, and at &s;uch a tyme as they lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected it.</P>

<P>The particular Acts and pa&s;&s;ages in taking this famous Citie, is thus (for &s;ome mens better &s;atisfaction) remembred.</P>

Trenches for their men, and Bulwarks for the great Ordnance to play on, very furiou&s;ly they made towards <HI>Ormus</HI> thinking to meet no great oppo|&s;all; but the Portugalls though they let them land and pa&s;&s;e quietly into the Towne, with equall re&s;olution &s;topt the current of their fury, at fir&s;t encounter from their barracadoes defended with &s;hott and pike, &s;laying above three hundred, and with their Ordnance beat them back with more ha&s;te and amazedne&s;&s;e than their approach had courage: in this di&s;order a Flancker by mi&s;chance was blowne up, but the warre continued: little hurt accruing to either party, till the 24 of February, on which day the Engli&s;h advanced towards the Ca&s;tle, (under which was riding the Portu|gall Armado) and in de&s;pight of the Ca&s;tle and be&s;t defence their Fleet could make, being then but five Gallyons and twenty Frigots, &s;et fire on the Saint <HI>Pedro</HI> of one thou&s;and five hundred Tun, and Admirall of their Armado: which mi&s;chance, the re&s;t of the Spani&s;h Fleet with no &s;mall &s;or|row apprehended, and finding no repaire, to prevent more mi&s;chiefe and danger, cut the Cables, and in that flaming po&s;ture let her drive whither winde and tyde commanded her: the Engli&s;h &s;aw her too hot to meddle with, and knew &s;he could enrich the adventurer with no other booty, but <HI>Bellonaes</HI> furniture, &s;o downe &s;he went towards <HI>Larack,</HI> in the way a rabble of Arabians and Per&s;ians boorded her, &amp; like Iackhalls with hunger &s;tarved fury and avarice tore her a&s;under: that rapine, being no le&s;&s;e ba&s;e and out|ragious than the fire which two houres had a&s;&s;aulted her:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>March</HI> 17. 1627.</NOTE> the &s;eaven|teenth of March the Per&s;ians (to di&s;patch and &s;hew they were not idle) gave fire to a Mine &s;tuft with forty barrells of powder, which blew up a great part of the wall, through which breach the enraged Portugalls im|mediatly &s;allyed &amp; maintain'd the fight above one houre again&s;t the ama|zed Per&s;ian, who had drawne out a mayne Battalion, but when the Trum|pets &s;ounded, <HI>Acha</HI> recovered &s;en&s;e and magnanimity, going on &s;o coura|giou&s;ly, that the mo&s;t &s;low and hindmo&s;t di&s;covered plainly a full &s;corne of death, and powerfull de&s;ire of honourable execution: for nine houres this conflict continued with great fury, &s;o that in fine the defendants were forced to retreat, advis'd to it as well by pollicie as need: for, the heated Per&s;ian &s;uppo&s;ing them&s;elves victors, with great bravery begun to mount and enter the Citie in many quarters, at which the Portugalls were very joyfull, throwing on them &s;uch and &s;o many Granadoes and burning fire|balls, powder-pots, and &s;calding Lead, that the a&s;&s;ailants in de&s;pight of their vowes and bravadoes were forced to retreat, and could not prevent a thou&s;and of their men from peri&s;hing: which mi&s;ery, when <HI>Shaculibeg</HI> at full had viewed, couragiou&s;ly followed by two hundred men, hee pa&s;t through the fury of tho&s;e affrighting fires and took one of their Flanckers, but could not hold above halfe an houre, they were &s;o outragiou&s;ly fryed and tormented with &s;hewers of flames of Lead and Sulphur, and in de&s;|cending were beaten off by fifty Haydalgoes, who for three houres affron|ted them, repell'd them, and retyred crown'd with conque&s;t. This enter|tainment &s;o cool'd their bravery, that for five dayes they did nothing but contemplate the valour and dexterity of their adver&s;aries. But, the three and twentieth day a&s;&s;um'd more hopes, when they beheld the fight be|twixt the Engli&s;h and them; our Cannon from the &s;hore, playing &s;o hotly

and battring their fortifications &s;o &s;oundly, that at length making the &s;hips their object (after a great mutilation of &s;hrowds and ma&s;ts) they &s;unk the Vice &amp; reare Admirall of <HI>Ru-Fryero's</HI> Fleet: by that, utterly lo&s;ing their late hopes and o&s;tentation of marine command and excellencie. March 28 nece&s;&s;ity humble them (plague, famine, and fluxes raging in the City) &s;o as five dayes after, two wel-bred Gentlemen, well attended, with great gravity mounted in a faire equipage to the Enemies Camp; they were u&s;herd in by &s;ome Coozelba&s;hes of <HI>Shaculybegs</HI> Regiment, and after &s;mall comple|ment, begun to treat of peace, and that there might be a ce&s;&s;ation of Armes, which favour if the Duke would grant, they were ready to acknowledge it, and for retribution to pre&s;ent him two hundred thou&s;and Tomayns in hand, with good a&s;&s;urance of an annuall tribute of 140000 Ryalls, (which as afterwards they confe&s;&s;ed was &s;poken in hypocri&s;ie) the Captaine di&s;|mi&s;&s;es them, and appoints next day for an&s;wer, acquaints the Generall, who (wanting money) accepts their motion of peace, &s;o they would depo&s;e five hundred thou&s;and (amounting with us almo&s;t to two millions of pounds) and pay yeerely to the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> hundred thou&s;and: the Portugalls return'd him an an&s;wer, they were in no &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;e, to buy any favour &s;o di&s;honourably, and that greedine&s;&s;e &s;o overwhelmed them, they a&s;&s;ured, a fift part of that proportion &s;hould never buy their able&s;t benefits. After that, they mediated a reconciliation twixt the Engli&s;h and them, putting them in minde, how they were Chri&s;tians, and by many reciprocall favours of old (when <HI>Iohn</HI> of <HI>Gant</HI> invaded them) and later times by allyances, prevalent enough to beget good will in noble &s;pirits. If they had injured them, they were now &s;orry, and ready to &s;atisfie in any puni&s;hment of paine or pur&s;e, their Kings were at that in&s;tant good friends, and how could &s;uch ho&s;tility be defended or an&s;werd by law of Nations or Religion. The&s;e and the like were &s;ent them, but whether the behavi|our of the <HI>Fidalgo</HI> di&s;plea&s;ed our Sea men, or that they under&s;tood them not, or &s;aw them&s;elves &s;o farre ingaged, that with reputation they could not de&s;i&s;t, or that it was uttered with a faigned humility, or the like, I know not; the Me&s;&s;enger departed not well &s;atisfied. And two dayes after, &s;aw apparently &s;ignes of confu&s;ion and revenge: a hideous noi&s;e of helli&s;h thunder amazing them, caus'd by the Engli&s;h their blowing up two &s;eve|rall Mynes, which gave open pro&s;pect into the Citie; but the hearts of the a&s;&s;aylants dur&s;t not travell with their &s;ight, all their &s;en&s;es the la&s;t time were &s;o confounded and di&s;abled: &s;o that very poorely they onely be|came &s;pectators, and gave new courage to the dying Portugall: all of them halfe dead, with fluxes, thir&s;t, (the three pits in the Citie exhau&s;ted) fa|mine or pe&s;tilence. The fourteenth day, a &s;hip full of Moores from <HI>Ki&s;h|mee,</HI> arrived at <HI>Ormus</HI> to help the Portugalls; perceiving them&s;elves inter|cepted, they returned back, thinking to land at &s;ome better quarter: the Per&s;ian Generall, &s;wore they &s;hould receive no dammage by his Army, to which when they fooli&s;hly gave beliefe to, four&s;core of their heads were forthwith &s;truck off, and the re&s;t inchayned.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ormuzians</HI> langui&s;hing thus long under &s;o many &s;orts of afflictions, every houre hoped for delivery from <HI>Ru-Friero,</HI> but he failed them. The &s;eventeenth day another breach was made by giving fire to &s;ixty barrels of
<PB N="118" REF="65">
powder, through which the Moores entred in huge &s;warmes, but were beat back by eighteene Gentlemen without the Bulwark; howbeit, next day they re-entred and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it. The eighteenth of Aprill, two fami&s;ht renegadoes &s;tole thence into the Camp of their Adver&s;aries, and being brought before the Duke, confe&s;t the willingne&s;&s;e of their departure, told him their expectation of &s;upplies, together with their pre&s;ent mi&s;eries; a&s;&s;uring him, they could not endure long, death raging more furiou&s;ly within the City, than the greate&s;t forces they could oppo&s;e them with. At that report, the reanimated <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> againe be&s;eiges her, intending the next breach to enter pellmell among&s;t them: which when the <HI>Portugall</HI> &s;aw, and no &s;afety any way appearing; the three and twentieth day (know|ing no faith in the Mahomitans) they yeelded the Ca&s;tle, and their trea|&s;ure unto the Engli&s;h; only craving of them that they might receive their lives, and be conveyed &s;afely to <HI>Muskat</HI> in <HI>Arabia:</HI> the Engli&s;h a&s;&s;ent, and very nobly tran&s;ported three thou&s;and of them, and entended like favour to the re&s;t; but the envious <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> &s;uddenly intercepted above three hundred <HI>Arabs</HI> halfe Chri&s;tians, and <HI>Portugals:</HI> whom without par|ley or any &s;igne of pitty, contrarie to their oath and honour, they behead|ed; and &s;ent their heads to <HI>Gombroon</HI> for a Trophae, and as an a&s;&s;ured &s;ignal of their conque&s;t and blameworthy fury. After this, by unanime a&s;&s;ent, the Magazeens of armour, victualls and trea&s;ure were &s;ealed up with the &s;ignets of both Nations: the interim was imployed in ma&s;&s;acring of more than halfe dead men, violating women, polluting Temples, and defacing verie brave and gallant hou&s;es; during which, an unworthie Engli&s;h man (contrarie to the order) breaks into a forbidden Mona&s;terie &s;tuft with riches, and in his returne is di&s;cried by the ratling of his burthen&s;ome &s;a|criledge; at which the Per&s;ians flie to the Duke, and by con&s;ent break a&s;under everie thing was valuable, (the Engli&s;h all that time dreaming of no &s;uch accident) bus when it was known, much di&s;cour&s;e intervened on both &s;ides, but the Pagans accounted words but ayre, and &s;eeing their de|&s;ignes accompli&s;hed, made the fury and anger of the Engli&s;h meere pro|vocatives of &s;corne and laughter: the Enli&s;h had no more than twentie thou&s;and pounds paid them for their &s;ervice. The bra&s;&s;e Ordnance in the Ca&s;tle and Rampires were divided, &s;ome &s;ay they were three hundred, others as many moe: Howbeit, our men &s;ay there were only fifty three great bra&s;&s;e peeces mounted, foure bra&s;&s;e cannon, &s;ix bra&s;&s;e demicannon, &s;ixteen cannon pedroes of bra&s;&s;e, and one of iron, 9 culverin of bra&s;&s;e, two demiculverin of bra&s;&s;e, three of iron, ten bra&s;&s;e ba&s;es, &s;even bra&s;&s;e ba&s;tels, &s;ome ba&s;ilisks of 22 foot long, and nintie two bra&s;&s;e peeces unmounted; which I the rather name, in that the Portugalls bragge they had &s;mall de|fence, and few Ordnance; with either of which if they had beene fur|ni&s;hed, <HI>Ormus</HI> had never beene triumphed over. Tho&s;e belonging to the Per&s;ian were tran&s;ported to other Cittadells, to <HI>Gombroon, Larr, Shyraz, Hi&s;pahan,</HI> and <HI>Babylon.</HI> The King of <HI>Ormus, Seid Mahumet &s;haw,</HI> was made pri&s;oner to the <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> and at this day is at <HI>Shyraz</HI> under an allow|ance of five markes a day; his other pen&s;ion (during his pro&s;perity paid him by the Portugalls) amounted yeerely to a hundred and forty thou|&s;and ryalls. The Town at this day is wholly ruinous, the Ca&s;tle excepted,
<PB N="119" REF="65">
which a&s;pect keepes her former beauty, &s;trength, and greatne&s;&s;e, and is owned by the Per&s;ian.</P>
<P>As for the common Mariners, they found enough to throw away; by that little they got, &s;hewing their luxurie, nothing but <HI>Alea, vina, Venus,</HI> in the a&s;cendant of their devotion. Captain <HI>Woodcocks</HI> luck was be&s;t and wor&s;t; by rare chance he lighted upon a Frigot that was &s;tealing away, loden with Pearles and ine&s;timable trea&s;ure, above a Million of royalls for his part only; but what joy had he in that fading pelfe? pure clay is gold, who then &s;o mad to make the earth his Idol?

<HEAD>THE SECOND BOOKE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE tenth of Ianuary, Sir <HI>Robert Sherley</HI> at our Amba&s;&s;adors reque&s;t, entred <HI>Gumbrown</HI> to acquaint the Sultan with his arrivall, and to demand &s;uch en|tertainment and nece&s;&s;aries as befitted his excellen|cy and Travaile to the Per&s;ian Court, though no le&s;&s;e di&s;tant than the Ca&s;pian &s;ea. It did not reli&s;h right to the covetous Sultan; but upon &s;ight of his Phirman or letter of Command, he di&s;&s;embled his humour, prote&s;ting he was tran&s;ported with joy that &s;o happy an occa|&s;ion was hapned, as well to expre&s;&s;e him&s;elfe an obedient &s;lave to <HI>Shaw-Abbas,</HI> as that the Towne &s;hould be honoured by &s;o noble a &s;tranger; &s;or|ry onely he was &s;o ill fitted to &s;hew his humanity, his Lord&s;hips &s;o &s;udden landing preventing the pomp he aymed him. Sir <HI>Robert Sherley</HI> returned his complement and forthwith invited my Lord Amba&s;&s;ador a&s;hoare, who as readily accepted it. At his i&s;&s;uing from the &s;hip, Captaine <HI>Browne</HI> (whom I name to honour him) thundred out his farewell by a hundred great Shot, who&s;e Ecchoes not onely made <HI>Gombroon</HI> to tremble, but &s;eemed to rend the higher regions with their bellowings. Wrapt in &s;moak and flame, we landed &s;afely, tho Neptune made us dance upon his liquid billowes and with his &s;alt breath &s;ea&s;oned the Epicinia or intended Tri|umphs. At his landing the Cannons from the Ca&s;tle and Cittadell vomit|ed out their fiery choller, ten tymes roring out their wrathfull clamours, to our delight and terrour of the Pagans, who of all noy&s;es mo&s;t hate artifi|ciall Thunder. The Sultan and <HI>Shawbander</HI> handed him out of his Bardge, and mounted him upon a &s;tately Arabian Cour&s;er; the &s;tirrops were of pure gold, the &s;addle (a Morocco &s;ort) was mo&s;t richly imbrodered with &s;ilver. All his followers had al&s;o &s;uch as plea&s;ed them. In this equi|page, attended by his owne gentlemen, &s;ome &s;ea Captaines, the Engli&s;h Agent Ma&s;ter <HI>Burt</HI> and two hundred <HI>Coozell-ba&s;hawes,</HI> we moved &s;lowly towards the Sultans Pallace, all the way pa&s;&s;ing through a ranck, or file of
<PB N="121" REF="66">
Archers and Mu&s;quetiers on either &s;ide doubled, and being alighted, u&s;herd him into his Apollo; where upon rich carpets was plac't a neat and co&s;tly Banquet, &s;tore of <HI>Shyraz</HI> Wine, and choyce Violls from the &s;hips; all which, with his prote&s;tations of welcome, (<HI>Ho&s;homody Suffowardy</HI> &s;till dropping out of his mouth) gave us undoubted knowledge that either he was a grand hypocrite, or extreamely fearefull a complaint &s;hould be made to the great Duke of <HI>Shyraz</HI> again&s;t him of his pa&s;t neglect; all which we gave a favourable interpretation unto: let us now into and about the towne, to &s;ee if ought will pre&s;ent it &s;elfe a welcome object.</P>
<P>GVMBROVVN (or <HI>Gomroon</HI> as &s;ome pronounce it) is by mo&s;t Per|&s;ians <GAP DESC="foreign"> cald <HI>Bander</HI> or the Port Towne: &s;eated upon the gulph, in the <HI>Carmanian</HI> de&s;ert (part whereof is now cald <HI>Larr</HI>) or in <HI>Kermoen</HI> as the Per&s;ians call it; albeit my fancie prompts me, that it is rather in <HI>Chu|&s;i&s;tan, Shu&s;han</HI> being &s;o &s;mall a way removed from it. Some (but I com|mend them not) write it <HI>Gamrou,</HI> others <HI>Gomrow,</HI> and other-&s;ome <HI>Cum|meroon.</HI> The Artique pole mounts here to &s;even and twenty degrees and nine minutes. A Towne it is of no Antiquity, ri&s;ing daily out of the ruines of late glorious (now mo&s;t wretched) <HI>Ormus,</HI> an houres journey thence.</P>
<P>I was told, that it had not twelve hou&s;es twelfve yeares ago; at this day encrea&s;ed to a thou&s;and: but how can I credit it, &s;ince one <HI>Newbery</HI> our country-man entitles it a Town at his being here, which was in the yeare 1581. Yet old it cannot be, &s;ince all agree the Portugals fir&s;t founded it; after <HI>Ormous</HI> doubtle&s;&s;e, and where the Ca&s;tle was begun but in <HI>Anno</HI> 1513 by <HI>Albuquerq'</HI> the Portugall. <HI>Gumbroon</HI> is from <HI>Ormus</HI> nine engli&s;h myles: it al&s;o viewes Arabia about &s;ixteene leagues we&s;t, for there the Gulph is narrowe&s;t. It was forced from the Portugall in the yeare 1612 by <HI>Ally-Reec</HI> the <HI>Shyrazian,</HI> and is now compleatly governed by the Per&s;ian. It is in compa&s;&s;e about two myles, the earth is &s;andy, without gardens, &s;prings, or gra&s;&s;e: from March to October &s;o hot, as the Natives flie away to <HI>Larr</HI> and other Townes where Date trees &s;hadow them again&s;t the ever burning Sunne, and ground or &s;and that &s;calds like hotte&s;t embers: a great Mountayne (reckned twenty miles di&s;tant, but by its height &s;eemes not eight) anticipates the coole North-wind, which to other parts breaths &s;weetly and refre&s;hes them. The hou&s;es are of Sunne-dried bricks, thick &amp; &s;ollid; within, are without much furniture; without &s;imple to look upon. The windowes are large and trelli&s;ed, made to open when any Favonius murmurs among them. The tops are tarra&s;&s;ed, made both to walk &amp; &s;leep upon, &s;o Carpets be &s;pred to &s;often them. In the Summer &s;ea&s;on when few &s;hips ride here, they &s;leep in troughs or beds fild with water. The Buzzar is very ordinary: tis covered atop to keep out the &s;earching beames of the &s;cortching Sunne; where under is &s;old Wine, Arack, Sher|bet, Thlummery, and many other things to the eye and belly nece&s;&s;ary. The entrance into the Sultans hou&s;e, is at the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the Market place. His, the Shabanders, Engli&s;h, and Duch (di&s;tingui&s;ht by their Flags or En|&s;ignes, displayed by <HI>Aeolus</HI> atop their hou&s;es) are all are worth the entring in or my noting: of be&s;t note, are two Ca&s;tles, at the North and South ends of the Towne, &s;patious and defen&s;ive; adorn'd with good Battlements and
<PB N="122" REF="67" MS="y">
Platformes to play their u&s;ele&s;&s;e Cannons on. Foure&s;core bra&s;&s;e Peeces are planted here, and are part of tho&s;e they got from <HI>Ormus Anno</HI> 1622; two hundred more being &s;ent up to <HI>Larr, Spahawn</HI> and <HI>Babylon</HI>) of &s;mall ter|rour, if no better Gunners exerci&s;e them. Whiles &s;hips ride here, <HI>Gum|broon</HI> is a garri&s;on foure hundred hor&s;e and foot attend their Gene|rall; but dare not fight again&s;t the Sonne, all &s;ummer billeting where they can find food and &s;helter. In winter you may find here, Merchants of &s;undry Nations; Engli&s;h, Ducth, Per&s;ians, Indians, Arabs, Armenians, Turks, Iewes, and others. The mo&s;t common commodities here, are belly food; Wine, Rack, Sherbet, Ro&s;ewater, Sugar, Almonds, Dates, Pomgra|nats, Figs, Currans, Orenges, Lemmons, Pomecitrons, Mirabolans, Ap|ples, Peares, Quinces, and Flowers, in great variety. As al&s;o, Goates, Hens, egges (two yeare old,) Ryce, &amp;c. mo&s;t of which are &s;old by the crafty, faire &s;poken <HI>Bannyans,</HI> who &s;warme through all parts of A&s;ia. They will readily trade or prattle with Chri&s;tian, Turk, Iew, or Gentile, but have no good fellow&s;hip, for they hate to eat or drink with any &s;ave of their owne ca&s;ts and religion; rice, plaintains, and &s;ome fruits they eat, drink water or &s;herbet (which is faire water, ro&s;ewater, &s;ugar and juyce of Lemons put together): but for fle&s;h, eggs, or &s;uch roots, as raddi&s;h and the like, re&s;embling blood or wine, not one bitt would they eat, though you would give the poore&s;t knave among&s;t them, a thou&s;and pound; they are troubled with <HI>Pythagoras</HI> dreames, doubting thereby they might eat up the &s;oules of their friends or parents; which tran&s;migration of &s;oules <HI>Tibullus</HI> elegantly thus detects to his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;e.</P>

<P>PERSEPOLIS, (fir&s;t call'd <HI>Elamis</HI> from <HI>Elam</HI> &s;onne of <HI>Sem</HI> &s;onne of <HI>Noah</HI>) was built (enlarg'd rather) by <HI>So&s;armus</HI> a Median Dyna&s;t, third from <HI>Arbaces</HI> that put a period (by death of <HI>Sardanapalus</HI>) to the A&s;&s;yrian Monarchy, begun by <HI>Belus</HI> (<HI>Nymrod</HI> and <HI>Iupiter</HI>) and in a glorious &s;ucce&s;&s;i|on of one and forty Emperours commanding the world, till <HI>Arbaces</HI> &s;ub|jected Babylon. By <HI>Camby&s;es</HI> (&s;onne to <HI>Cyrus</HI> the magnificent) it was mo&s;t beautified, and from him to <HI>Darius Codomanus</HI> continued Empre&s;&s;e of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> two hundred &amp; thirty yeares in a line of thirteen Monarchs, till <HI>Alexander</HI> by conque&s;t of all <HI>A&s;ia</HI> made pro&s;trate al&s;o this glorious Citie, betrayed by <HI>Teredates,</HI> and demoli&s;ht by vehement per&s;wa&s;ion of <HI>Thais</HI> an Athenian harlot, who (in revenge of <HI>Xerxe's</HI> expedition into Greece) never gave over exa&s;perating the giddy Macedonian, till &s;hee &s;aw it flaming; an act &s;o unworthy <HI>Alexander</HI> as hee &s;ought to quench it with his teares. A Citie &s;o excellent, that <HI>Quintus Curtius</HI> and <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> intitle it the riche&s;t and mo&s;t lovely Citie under the Sunne. A high and &s;tately Tower it had, circled with a triple Wall: &s;ixteene cubits high the fir&s;t, adorn'd with battlements; the &s;econd was two and thirty; the third of three&s;core cubits high, of delicate poli&s;ht Marble, entred by many gates of burni&s;ht bra&s;&s;e. To the Ea&s;t ro&s;e amiably a hill of foure Akers, in which (in &s;tate|ly Mau&s;oleums) were intombed the Monarchs of the world. Many rare and admirable buildings it had, among&s;t which, the glorious Temple of <HI>Diana</HI> (mother to that at <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI>) by <HI>Io&s;ephus</HI> report was at that time the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite for Art &amp; material in the world. The &s;tones were of riche&s;t Marble and Porphire, the roofe of refined gold. A bayt <HI>Antiochus</HI> the ava|ritious Athei&s;t long had nibled at, but could not &s;wallow it, as he had done Jeru&s;alems, whence &s;acrilegiou&s;ly he ravi&s;ht ten tunne of gold. The Pa|lace royall here, was cut out of the marble rock, above two miles about; the roofe and ca&s;ements were of Gold, Silver, Amber, &amp; Ivory. The State within, was of gold and orientall glittering gems, in one roome an artifi|ciall Vine (pre&s;ented by <HI>Pythius</HI>) the &s;talk pure gold, the clu&s;ters of pearls and carbuncles; his bol&s;ter was valued at five thou&s;and Talents of gold, his foot&s;toole worth three thou&s;and; &s;uch, as (after the unruly Greeks had pillag'd three dayes) gave the Macedonian Victor for his part, 120000 Talents, or 72 millions of crownes, a ma&s;&s;e of gold: yet very po&s;&s;ible, if it be true old Hi&s;tories report (<HI>Herodotus</HI> is one) how that at that time, the Monarchs of Per&s;ia (be&s;ides the Tribute of other Kingdomes) had yeerely

But we may beleeve it, &s;ince &s;acred writ tells us that in <HI>Solomons</HI> reigne, in Jeru&s;alem gold and &s;ilver was as common as &s;tones. Al&s;o <HI>Xenophon,</HI> that when <HI>Cyrus</HI> de&s;cended into A&s;ia the le&s;&s;e, hee brought back no le&s;&s;e than 125 millions of pounds.

Neere the highe&s;t &s;tep, is the entrance into the Palace; the breadth is vi&s;i|ble, in de&s;pight of flame and weather: on one &s;ide the gate &s;tands a mon&s;trous great Elephant, on the other a Rhinoceros; the di&s;tance is about twenty foot, the portraicts are out of the &s;hining Marble, ten yards high either of them, fixt and perpetuall: a few paces thence, are of like work, bulk and matter two gallant Towers, and (to fini&s;h the Porters Lodge) neere them is an other ruine, a Pega&s;us an invention of the Sculptor to il|lu&s;trate his Art: and being pa&s;t this portall, the Apollo opens, a faire even ground, deplorable in many ruines, a hundred white Marble pillars, whole and broken dignifying this once mo&s;t excellent &s;tructure. Upon many of the&s;e white Marble pillars the Storks have builded them their ne&s;ts, where the rage of winde and weather is more offen&s;ive to them than any dread they have of the people who inhabit neere them: in all un&s;ea&s;onable &s;tormy or cold weather they for&s;ake the Region and fly where the Sunne can comfort them: the Per&s;ians have many &s;uper&s;titious &s;tories concern|ing 'em, and &s;uppo&s;e them (as el&s;e-where I have noted) the Emblems of piety and gratitude. The Pillars which are at this day &s;tanding, (but &s;eeme to groane under the tyrannie of Time) are twixt fifteene &amp; twenty cubits high, &amp; ri&s;e beautifully in forty &s;quares or concave parallels; every &s;quare has three full inches; whereby the circuit may be gathered: mo&s;t excel|lent is the matter, mo&s;t elegant the work, and no le&s;&s;e commendable, the

A third chamber conjoynes the la&s;t we &s;poke of, this (if they lie not that told us &s;o) was a Gynecie or Nur&s;ery; it has foure un|equall angles, two &s;ides are &s;ixtie; the other two, &s;eventy of my large&s;t paces. From that we i&s;&s;ued into a fourth roome, two &s;ides are twenty, the other two, thirty paces. The walls are very eminent in this chamber, of black &s;hining Marble, in many places &s;o bright and jetty, as we could ea&s;ily view our reflex, no &s;teel mirror comparing with it. In mo&s;t parts the walls are cut into Gygantive Images, illu&s;trated with Gold, to this day permanent. Somewhat further, over heaps of &s;tones of valewable portraictures, we mount towards the mo&s;t lofty part of this Pallace, where we &s;aw the re&s;emblances of a devout King, adoring his three Dietyes, the Sunne, the Fire, a Serpent, all which are cut upon the perpendicu|lar Mountaine. The other &s;ide of this high hill is a precipice, downe which is no de&s;cending. But whether this Fabrick was <HI>Ionick, Dorick,</HI> or <HI>Corinthiack,</HI> in the perfection, I cannot determine, the ruines forbid a po&s;itive judgement. But &s;uch at this day it is, that a ready Lymmer in three moneths &s;pace can hardly (to do it well) depict out all her excellencies. Pitty it is, it is not done, the barbarous people every day defacing it and cleaving it a&s;under for grave-&s;tones and benches to &s;it upon. Five miles We&s;t from <HI>Chehel-manor</HI> is al&s;o a gallant Monument, a Giant cut into a mon&s;truous proportion, whom the illiterate Per&s;ians &s;ay was <HI>Ru&s;tan,</HI> and from him cald <HI>Nocta-Ru&s;tan.</HI> I rather judge it the Image of great <HI>Alex|ander,</HI> who had a de&s;ire, that after ages might think him more than a man, and his men more than Mon&s;ters, as appeared in his conceit to make

many Armors, bigg enough for three men, and &s;catter them in <HI>India</HI> that the people might not dare to rebell, le&s;t tho&s;e Poliphems came to la&s;h them.</P>
<P>Neere <HI>Chilmanor</HI> is <HI>Marda&s;h</HI> (corruptly by the Spaniard cald <HI>Margate|an</HI>) a Towne of two hundred hou&s;es, the people &s;o &s;uper&s;titious that &s;uch hou&s;es as we came in they perfumd and ayr'd (&s;ome were happily fired) for that we were not Mu&s;&s;ulmen. From this place to <HI>Sheraz</HI> are ten far|&s;angs; interpo&s;d by &s;ome craggy hills and a plea&s;ant river (<HI>Rhogomana</HI> of old) over which is a bridge, the be&s;t till then we &s;aw in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> This river is by <HI>Quintus Curtius lib.</HI> 5. and <HI>Strabo lib.</HI> 15. named <HI>Araxis</HI> (<HI>Cho-Araxes</HI> is a fitter name) &s;treaming (&s;ayes he) twentie furlongs from <HI>Per&s;epolis.</HI> Another of that name, &s;o often mentioned by <HI>Ptol. Mela, Plutarch,</HI> and <HI>Lucan,</HI> is in <HI>Armenia,</HI> and indeed divides it from <HI>Medya,</HI> at this day cald <HI>Ara&s;h</HI>) and very famous.</P>
<P>After two dayes &s;tay in view of old <HI>Per&s;epolis,</HI> the eight and twentieth day we took hor&s;e, and that night rid foure and twentie miles to a Town cald <HI>Moy own;</HI> in midway twixt which two Townes, we noted a high im|pregnable mount, at who&s;e top, &s;tood de&s;perately a Ca&s;tle &s;o fortified by Nature and indu&s;trie, as may be thought impregnable. A late rebel|lious Sultan (weary of &s;lavery) man'd it again&s;t his Prince victorious <HI>Ab|bas,</HI> who (to terrifie others by his example) came in per&s;on to cha&s;ti&s;e him. But &s;uch was the precipitious height where the Ca&s;tle &s;tood, and the narrow entrance &s;o bravely defended, that in &s;ix moneths &s;iege hee could &s;ee no &s;igne of victory. Loth he is to leave it &s;o, and what &s;trata|gem to take, cannot imagin. A great reward he promi&s;es to any would ef|fect it. Valour is invalidable. Art Magique perpetrates it. An old wi|zard covetous of &s;o much money promi&s;es the Divells be&s;t, and according|ly, by his infernall &s;pells &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;t with threats and phanta&s;maes the wretched Sultan, that upon the witches a&s;&s;urance of pardon he de&s;cends, the block rewards him. But <HI>Abbas</HI> acknowledges the Inchanter had me|rited his price and grudgingly gave it him. The fooli&s;h man &s;o doates upon his gold, that he &s;ees not danger. The King repents the lo&s;&s;e of it, and knowes no way to recover it but by &s;ending him to Satan without his head, the rea&s;on of his Ju&s;tice was for his Sorcery. A quality at other times he commended deeply, but now abhorred it: a pretty pollicy. To re|turne.</P>

Next night we lodgd (&s;lept I cannot &s;ay) in <HI>O-jone,</HI> a village of thirty Families, all of them Prophets or Prophets children. We ever found lea&s;t profit, where Prophets dwelt, no wine nor grapes allowd to grow among&s;t them; not that wine is bad, but out of a Tradition they have, that it is the blood of tho&s;e Gyants that warr'd again&s;t the Gods.

<P>The tenth of Aprill wee &s;et out from <HI>Spahawnet</HI> a village &s;ix miles South from <HI>Spahawn:</HI> when we had gone a far&s;ang (three miles,) we were &s;tayed by the way to ta&s;te a banquet in a &s;pacious garden of the Kings, whither the Engli&s;h Agent and &s;uch other Chri&s;tian Merchants as were in <HI>Spahawn</HI> came out to attend our Lord Amba&s;&s;ador: a mile neerer the Citie, the Vi&s;ier, the Sultan of <HI>Spahawn, Meloyembeg</HI> and <HI>Hodge-nazar</HI> the Armenian Prince with foure thou&s;and hor&s;e and innumerable foot, came to bid us a happy entrance: the fields two miles from the towne were re|pleni&s;ht with vulgar men, women and childen; the <HI>Bannyans</HI> like caterpil|lers &s;warmd about us; all together, in a volley of thundering acclamations cried out <HI>Ho&s;homody, Suffowardy,</HI> the better &s;ort <HI>Ho&s;hgaldom</HI> i.e. welcome, heartily welcome: forty kettle Drums, Fifes, Tabrets Tymbrels, dancing wenches, Hocus Pocu&s;&s;es, and other Anticks pa&s;t my numbring inobled the ceremony: the bridge was full of women on both &s;ides, many of them in faire deportment unma&s;qued their faces. The fir&s;t place we alighted at was the <HI>Conna-pot&s;haugh,</HI> the Kings Pallace, placed at the We&s;t &s;ide of the Medan or great Market: there the Noble men kneeled downe, and <HI>te&s;&s;alemd,</HI> three times ki&s;&s;ing the Kings thre&s;hold, and as many times knock|ing their heads again&s;t the ground in an awfull obey&s;ance: Sir <HI>Robert Sher|ley</HI> &s;izedaed al&s;o and contented them; a Co&s;elba&s;h ended the ceremo|ny in a panegyrick to this purpo&s;e: That the Fame and excellency of <HI>Shaw-Abbas</HI> was &s;o great as had attracted a great Prince and other Gentlemen from the extreame&s;t Angle of the world, to &s;ee whether fame had been partiall in his magnificence: no wonder, &s;ince his radiant beames &s;pread them&s;elves over all the Univer&s;e: that done, &s;ome bottles of good Wine were lavi&s;ht out, after which with a continued clamour of the Plebeyans, we were conducted to a brave hou&s;e of the Kings, at the South-Ea&s;t end of the City, through which, a deep broad water had its cour&s;e into the <HI>Sindery.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth day after our being in <HI>Spahawn,</HI> the Engli&s;h Agent banquet|ed our Lord Amba&s;&s;ador, and &s;hewed us a rich and hearty welcome: to agrandize it, at night a Tanck of water was be&s;et with lighted Tapers, ar|tificially uniting the two contrary Elements; &s;quibs al&s;o and other fire|works, that made all the City gaze and gape with wonder.

Mo&s;t part of the la&s;t night wee cro&s;t a mi&s;erable inho&s;pitable &s;andie De&s;art, ten long miles broad, in length a hundred: where we beheld mountaines of loo&s;e &s;and, accumula|ted by the winds fury in &s;uch heaps as upon any great wind the tract is lo&s;t, and pa&s;&s;engers (too oft) involv'd and &s;tifled by that impetuous mercile&s;&s;e Tyrant, yea Camels, Hor&s;es, Mules, or other bea&s;ts, though &s;trong, &s;wift and &s;teady, peri&s;h without mercy: Albeit the King (to do as much as may be for prevention) has rais'd at every 3 miles end a Ca&s;tle, but by the un|&s;table foundation, is in March &amp; September in de&s;pight of their be&s;t props yeerely peece-meale torne a&s;under, without any remaines of their late &s;tanding. This our la&s;t nights travell was thirty miles. Next night wee rode one and twenty miles to <HI>Suffedaw,</HI> an old rotten weather-beaten Inn or Carravans-raw, and placed in part of an un&s;ociable De&s;art. Our next nights lodging was at <HI>Syacow</HI> ten far&s;angs (or para&s;&s;angs as <HI>Pliny</HI> calls them) thirty miles Engli&s;h, notable in her Carravans-raw, built from the ground of good free &s;tone, white and poli&s;ht, and was the fir&s;t building of that ma|teriall I &s;aw in eight hundred miles riding; a word of our la&s;t nights jour|ney. The mo&s;t part of the night we rode upon a cau&s;ey broad enough for ten hor&s;e abrea&s;t, built by incredible labour and expence over a mo&s;t dreadfull De&s;art, eeven and affoording a plaine Horizon of boggy loo&s;e ground, cover'd a top, a yards depth with pure &s;alt, as white as &s;now; a mi|&s;erable pa&s;&s;age, for if either the wind force the &s;alt abroad like du&s;t, or that by any accident Hor&s;e or Camell mi&s;take the way, the quaggy bogg up|holds them not, but &s;uffers them to &s;inck pa&s;t all recoverie; a pa&s;&s;age more feared, from &s;ome forlorne hopes that pillage pa&s;&s;engers; God be ble&s;t, wee e&s;caped this, but not another, little le&s;&s;e formidable; for wee had no &s;ooner pa&s;t the &s;alt De&s;art, but of nece&s;&s;ity wee mu&s;t climb over and about hills, &s;o high and glomerating, as if <HI>Olympus</HI> had beene cut out into Deda|lian labyrinths.

In the Scythick tongue &s;hee meanes a &s;tranger, (as <HI>Iu&s;tin</HI> in his twelfth book) given by the rude Tartar, as to us the name Welch, by the barbarous Saxon.

<P>Next night (<HI>Diana</HI> running cheerfully through her Zodiac) wee rode eighteene long miles to <HI>Gezz</HI> a pretty Lodge belonging to the King: the greater part of this nights journey was through the bottoms of tran&s;ected <HI>Taurus,</HI> who&s;e &s;tupendious forehead wets it &s;elfe in the ayery middle re|gion: the fretum or lane is abut forty yards broad, even below, and be|&s;trew'd with pibbles; either &s;ide is wall'd with an amazing hill, higher than to reach up at twice &s;hooting, and for eight miles &s;o continues, agreeing with the relation <HI>Pliny</HI> and <HI>Solinus</HI> make of it: a prodigious pa&s;|&s;age, whether by Art or Nature que&s;tionable: I allude it unto Nature (Gods hand-maid.) But if it bee the &s;ame which <HI>Pliny</HI> calls <HI>Ca&s;piae portae; Bertius, Ca&s;piarum Clau&s;tra; Strabo,</HI> and <HI>Ptolomy, Pilae Ca&s;piae, Mediae vel Zagriae;</HI> and <HI>Zarzaeae</HI> by <HI>Dio.

Howbeit, the Per&s;ians appropriate it to <HI>Mortys-Ally;</HI> who with his &s;licing Sham&s;heer for the ea&s;e of his people made it; a &s;word after their Cabala a hundred cubits long; and where|with at one blow he beheaded ten (or as &s;ome &s;ay, a hundred) thou&s;and Chri&s;tians: of no credit, in that <HI>Pliny</HI> (ere <HI>Mortis-Ally</HI> was horne) thus writes of it, <HI>Ruptura e&s;t Montis longitudine octo mill: pa&s;&s;: angu&s;ti&s;sima,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>Of more certainty is this, a Per&s;ian in our company told me. That a dozen yeeres ago, a valiant thiefe with five hundred hor&s;e and three hun|dred Mu&s;quets defended this narrow roade again&s;t all pa&s;&s;engers; none pa&s;|&s;ing nor re-pa&s;&s;ing without Tribute. The King of <HI>Larry-Ioon,</HI> and other mountaneers frown'd at his &s;aw&s;ine&s;&s;e, and threatned his bani&s;hment; but &s;uch &s;tormes made good mu&s;ick to his eares: <HI>Abbas</HI> growes cholerick to bee &s;o bearded by an ordinary fellow, and &s;cornes to honour his over|throw by an Army: for knowing he had many Cavalleers about him, he doubted not by their courages to fetter him: he moves it and propo&s;es a reward: but they had heard the thiefe was of incomparable fortitude and dexterity; &s;o as by long &s;ilence <HI>Abbas</HI> findes their feare, and grows pale at it: yet ere hee could give his rage a vent, a bold Armenian under-takes it: the King embraces him, and breaths fre&s;h courage into the hardy Chri|&s;tian, who excellently mounted, &s;ingles out the gladded thiefe, that doub|ted not to ma&s;ter &s;o faire a bea&s;t with &s;mall oppo&s;all. It was his cu&s;tome to give good play; u&s;ually commanding his company to look on, if one or le&s;&s;e than five entred the &s;trait; &s;uch high confidence had he in his va|lour and dexterity; in &s;hort &s;pace they met, but parlee in <HI>Mars</HI> his language; the Armenian (in all points fitted for a &s;terne encounter) fol|lowed his blowes with &s;uch skill and fury, that after long fight and much blood&s;hed on either party, upon clo&s;e hee made death a pa&s;&s;age: a victory &s;o irk&s;ome to his men (who&s;e lives depended on his &s;afety) that like robd Beares they fell upon the victor Armenian, who had doubtle&s;&s;e there ex|pired, had not an Ambu&s;h of many brave Coo&s;el-ba&s;haes broke out and

But &s;ee the end of &s;uch Apo&s;tacy.

<P>Our next nights manzeil was at <HI>Halvary</HI> (eighteene miles from <HI>Gezz</HI>) a well built Towne it is, and plea&s;antly &s;eated, the earth being mellowed by a &s;weet rivolet, that purls from the tops of <HI>Taurus,</HI> from who&s;e ver|tue the ground is richly appareld in greene, and requites the painfull hu&s;|bandman with a happy acknoledgement of Olives, Walnuts, Rice, Wheat, and Wood in great abundance: bidding a &s;ad farewell to that healthy Village, the next night we rode 20 miles to <HI>Peri&s;cow i.e.</HI> a broken Moun|tain: a Town &s;omtimes honoured with the Kings re&s;idence; not that the beauty of his hou&s;e (but ordinary) allures him, choy&s;e hawking, Phe&s;ants and other game more delighting him here than any other part of <HI>Parthia.</HI> The Pole is here elevated &s;ix and thirty degrees: the Towne is refre&s;ht with chry&s;tallin water, &s;weet and advantagious to the earth and her inha|bitants: tis built upon the brow of a high (well woodded) divided hill, who&s;e top has beene crown'd with a va&s;t Ca&s;tle, but now by age or warre (the canckerwormes of all temporaries) is moath-eaten, her ribbs onely appeare, expre&s;&s;ing de&s;olation and famine.

<P>After two dayes repo&s;e in <HI>Peri&s;cow,</HI> we jogd on; the Court then being little more than a hundred miles from us. Our fir&s;t nights journey from <HI>Peri&s;cow,</HI> was to <HI>Gheer,</HI> foure and twenty long miles, and tedious: &s;ome part was over terrible hills, other part through whi&s;tling dales; in both which we were &s;o weather-beaten with a raging &s;torme of wind and haile bred in <HI>Tartary,</HI> and forc't over the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> &s;ea (which from hence if the &s;ea&s;on had permitted wee might have &s;eene) that it not onely tooke away our &s;ight and hearing, but threatned our braines; for in de&s;pight of our be&s;t skill and clo&s;ing one with another, it &s;eparated us; in&s;omuch as we had hardly recovered our companies, had not the melodious noy&s;e of the braying Mules, and jingling of the Cammells bells revoked, yea untwi&s;ted us out of the&s;e <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> or <HI>Zagrian</HI> &s;traits; through which, when neither Sunne, nor Moone, nor Starre befriends, who&s;oever hereafter travell, let them (if they would prevent precipitious falls) borrow <HI>The&s;eus</HI> his thred, or be content to wander in endle&s;&s;e labyrinths.

<P>The <HI>Pot-&s;haugh</HI> ro&s;e up; and in the Turki&s;h Tongue gave him a gratious an&s;wer.

And by this, neither we nor he &s;hould have any need to traffique or corre&s;pond with <HI>Turkie.</HI> It would infinitely redound to his honour and content; for hereby he &s;houl'd di&s;appoynt the grand Seignior of his yearly cu&s;tomes which he is forct to pay, when his carravans go to <HI>Aleppo</HI> or other parts of <HI>Turkie</HI> to deliver the &s;ilk, to the Venetian, Genoan, French, or other European Merchants; and an unexpre&s;&s;able torment and vexation to his heart and &s;oule it mu&s;t needs be, to &s;ee the whole band of <HI>Ianizaryes</HI> maintained meerly out of tho&s;e his cu&s;tomes. What was this? but to cheri&s;h thorns to prick his eyes, or to make the &s;words of his inveterate Enemies &s;harp and fitted for his de&s;truction. Concerning <HI>Sherley</HI> he had been long of his acquaintance and done more for him, than any of his native &s;ubjects; that if <HI>Nog-dibeg</HI> had layd a&s;per&s;ions unju&s;tly on him, he &s;hould have decent &s;atisfaction.

And, albeit no|thing

be more commendable in Princes than Ju&s;tice, (for it is that that makes them gods) yet clemency is no le&s;&s;e honourable. <HI>Tully</HI> a heathen could affirme it, in his oration to <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> for the life of <HI>Lygarius:</HI> Thy cle|mency (O <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>) is mo&s;t excellent, yea more honourable than thy other vertues: Fortune hath made thee great, Nature advanc't thee higher in thy inclination unto mercy. Nor can they well bee &s;eparated. A Prince (exalted above others in dignity and Title) is tyed to an impartiall way, neither hating nor fearing any, but rewarding and puni&s;hing as cau&s;e re|quireth; without which, contempt or confu&s;ion followeth. But to the&s;e of <HI>Abbas</HI> I cannot give the glorious Attribute of Ju&s;tice: &s;ince, if the pu|ni&s;hment exceed the fault, it then degenerates into cruelty: a vice, odi|ous to God, (the Father and fountaine of mercy:) to men, by imitating their deformities; conceiting any Act, though never &s;o unnaturall (if moul|ded after &s;uch a pattern) good and commendable. And heathen Po|tentates &s;werving from the rule of divine Ju&s;tice, pamper the corrupt ha|bit and di&s;po&s;ition of their minds, out of a mon&s;trous appetite and opini|on that they are above all law, and may every way inebriate their lu&s;t, by &s;portfull tyranny: &s;uch were the inhumane games in the Roman Amphy|theators: &s;uch was the barbari&s;me, <HI>Xerxes</HI> (as <HI>Xenophon</HI> notes) practiz'd on <HI>Ma&s;i&s;tes</HI> his brother, &amp; other Satrapaes; &s;uch in <HI>Dejoces</HI> (father to <HI>Phraortes</HI>) who utterly exterminated the Per&s;ian genero&s;ity: &s;uch in mo&s;t Mahume|dans at this day governing: I cannot chu&s;e but adde the mi&s;erable Tra|gedy of his &s;onne, the memory whereof is recent through mo&s;t of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>

di&s;con&s;olate melancholy evaporates his &s;ad &s;pirits, leaving the expectation of hazard and &s;overaignty to <HI>Codobanda Sultan,</HI> &s;irnamed <HI>Soffee,</HI> who (made wi&s;e by his brothers mi&s;eries) &s;o exqui&s;itly behaved him&s;elfe, in duty to his King, in a plea&s;ing di&s;tance to the people; that <HI>Abbas</HI> doates, the peo|ple celebrate, and an uncontroulable good Fortune &s;eemes to dandle him, Affability, bounty, loyalty, courage, and experience in Armes, at home, abroad, the Per&s;ian Monarchy, Turk, Arab, Mogul, and Tartar, admiring, fearing, and commending him in &s;everall Eulogies and acclamations: his owne, left nothing un&s;aid or uninvented that might honour him; his ene|mies without giving their thoughts the lye, could not but idolize him: who for all that, (not like our common &s;pirits, efflated by every vulgar breath, upon every act, deifie them&s;elves, and conceit all great addi|tions of honour under their merits) &s;tood immovable, &s;orry he grew &s;o popular; mode&s;tly chiding them for flattery, condemned him&s;elfe of hypocri&s;y by &s;uffring his victories to bee &s;o guilded, &s;ince what he had or did was but a reflex of his Fathers vertue, which he doubted might &s;uffer an eclip&s;e by his accumulations. Oh! how execrable is this marrow fret|ting &s;cab of jealou&s;ie and envie? it converts that rea&s;on which only makes us Men, without any regard of ju&s;tice, into bruti&s;hne&s;&s;e; yea to exceed in cruelty the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable, mo&s;t violent creatures! Is not <HI>Abbas</HI> a King, a Father? does clemency belong to any attribute &s;o properly? Is not <HI>Soffee-Sultan-mirza</HI> a Prince, his &s;onne? on whom can he more ju&s;tly conferre his love? in whom &s;hould vertue rather dwell? where can there be a better center? poore Prince! the path he treads to adde lu&s;tre to his Fathers Diadem, to do his Country good, to be accounted commendable; betrayes his &s;teps, and intices him to an affrighting precipice: the more he labours to delight his Father, it &s;erves as fuell to an unju&s;t jealou&s;ie; the more hee dignifies his countries honour, the more applau&s;e the people crowne him with; and <HI>Abbas</HI> feares his popularity: yea &s;o farre cheri&s;hes di&s;honourable thoughts, &s;o much degenerates from paternall piety, that without all pitty or regard of ju&s;tice (which makes Kings more beautifull and glorious than when circled with a Tyrants &s;parkling Diadem) hee ru|minates his &s;peedy de&s;truction. During the&s;e his cabinet machinations, the harmele&s;&s;e Prince brandi&s;hes his &s;teele in proud <HI>Arabia,</HI> but after many conque&s;ts, him&s;elfe becomes captivated. An Arabian Prince&s;&s;e of good re|port, great beauty (in &s;uch bodies u&s;ually are impaled the faire&s;t &s;oules) and other excellent indowments fettered him: but by his bravery and worth quickly redeem'd him&s;elfe and vanqui&s;ht her. Such magick has love, &s;uch magnetick power is in vertue. By this Lady he had (in few yeeres) two children, <HI>Soffy</HI> and <HI>Fatyma:</HI> no le&s;&s;e loved by their Syre, than beloved, doated on by the Grand&s;yre <HI>Abbas;</HI> a &s;trange affection, to di&s;tinguish &s;o unnaturally; to &s;eparate where nature had &s;o &s;trongly joyned, to hate the graft, and have the fruit endeared to him.

An unparaleld barbari&s;me! an act &s;o unbe&s;eeming that fa|mous King, as among&s;t the common &s;ort to this day it is not credited: but, Fames brazen &s;hrill-mouth'd Trump &s;ounds it abroad, and ere long the Prince (then in action again&s;t the Tartar) has notice of his Syres inju&s;tice: hee leaves the Camp, and after many &s;ignalls of &s;orrow, be&s;eeches the King hee may know the rea&s;on of it: who fla&s;hes him this thundring rea|&s;on, for thy rebellion; he calls heaven to witne&s;&s;e his integrity and obedi|ence, but <HI>Abbas</HI> provokes him further, to intrap and have &s;ome colour to &s;atisfie the world in his de&s;truction. The Prince madded with heat and pa&s;&s;ion, imagines hee &s;aw <HI>Magar</HI> a &s;trangling; and in that exta&s;ie un&s;heaths his &s;word, vowing to re&s;cue him: the King &s;orrowes not at his di&s;traction, but at this advantage (upon &s;ome faire termes di&s;arming him) calls him in|to another roome, and (pretending he was not very well) goes out, com|manding &s;even big-bon'd villanies, deafe and dumbe, through a trap doore to i&s;&s;ue upon him, arm'd with bloody minds and deadly bow-&s;trings: their habit and weapons bewray their cruelty, they needed no other interpre|tors: the Prince admires the cau&s;e, and if oratory or other &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;ignes of entreaty could have gotten remor&s;e or delay from the&s;e hell|hounds, but till he knew the ground of this unnaturall project, he had af|foorded it: but, a&s;&s;ured they were inexorable, with an incomparable rage and &s;uddenne&s;&s;e he flies upon them, now one, then another receiving &s;uch horrid blowes, that (ere they could fa&s;ten on him, or in&s;nare him with their gha&s;tly twanging bow&s;trings) hee &s;ent three of them to the Divell; and long time defended him&s;elfe, offending tho&s;e blood-hounds with ad|mirable courage and dexterity, in&s;omuch that had hee ma&s;tered any wea|pon, hee had doubtle&s;&s;e &s;aved him&s;elfe; but wanting it, his breath failed, and longer his valour could not nouri&s;h him, for, <HI>facile e&s;t vincere non re|pugnantem:</HI> &s;o that at la&s;t thay fa&s;tened their noozes on him, who now was as a dead man; for all which, the villains had triumpht in his further tor|tures, had not the King prevented it, commanding them to pinnion him, and (before hee could recover his &s;ences) to draw a flaming &s;teele afore his eyes, and &s;o to blind him; forbidding him the &s;ight of what hee loved ever after; wife, babes, friends, &s;oldiers, or <HI>Magars</HI> carca&s;&s;e: And by this impiety, <HI>A&s;ia</HI> lo&s;t her faire&s;t jewell, <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> her Crown of honour, and <HI>Mars</HI> his darling.</P>

The &s;ilk-worme (as in quality, &s;o in diver&s;ity of &s;hape) varies from other wormes: her fir&s;t generation ari&s;ing from a &s;mall round black &s;perme (like Gunpowder or Mu&s;turd-&s;eed) which by moderate heat increa&s;es to an inch, a&s;&s;uming (at fir&s;t) the &s;hape of a palmer worme, from which re&s;emblance in &s;ix months &s;he two times changes: her common food are leaves and boughs of trees; but of all other, the white Mulbery mo&s;t delights her, &s;trewed dayly all over thier &s;heds, kept &s;weet, and warme, and cleanly.

<P>OMOALL, (of old, <HI>Zarama</HI> I imagin) is thought to bee that <HI>Na|borca</HI> or <HI>Naborea,</HI> where the Oracle of dreames was &s;o much famou&s;ed.

The place is fruitfull, and ble&s;t in pre&s;ent pro&s;perity and antick greatne&s;&s;e, the ruines compleating the report of her being once Metropo|lis; the hou&s;es at this day are not builded in the meane&s;t fa&s;hion, glorying above the re&s;t, in an old but &s;trong and &s;tately Ca&s;tle, &s;econd to none about her; which, be&s;ides the well compo&s;ed Architecture (affoording no &s;mall plea&s;ure to the eye) is ob&s;ervable in a deep trench fild with water, of good defence again&s;t the pilfering and rodomantadoes of the adjoyn|ing Tauri&s;ians: commendable al&s;o in &s;ome &s;weet gardens u&s;efull and de|lectable: within the Towne and neere the Ca&s;tle, is a famous Mo&s;que, honoured by foure hundred and foure and forty Princes and Prophets of that Kingdome intombed there, who&s;e Sepulchers rai&s;e admiration in the beholders; that e&s;pecially of <HI>Meer Agowmadeen</HI> is famous, to who&s;e &s;hrine are daily offered &s;erious devotion. As I entred, I found twenty reverent and well apparelled Arabians in a round, clo&s;e by the Princes Dormitory, with each an Arabic Alcoran before him; out of which, with great mode&s;ty and good mu&s;ick they chanted a dolefull requiem to his gho&s;t; in which they were &s;o &s;erious, that notwith&s;tanding I came &s;udden|ly among&s;t them, and in &s;uch a habit as others admired, they &s;ung on and in a Dorick &s;weetne&s;&s;e continued till they had fini&s;ht that their Threno|dy; which ended, they aro&s;e and bad me heartily welcome, readily poyn|ting out the rarities of their Temple. Thence, I went to the river &s;ide (over which upon a Bridge we rode the night before) hoping to &s;hade my &s;elfe (from outrageous Phaeton) under &s;ome Poplars there abounding; but quickly left the place againe: for 7 or eight beautious (but not ba&s;hful) Damo&s;ells (like &s;o many Dorids) &s;prung &s;uddenly out from the water, to admire my cloaths, never regarding they were naked; &s;ome my hat, my hayre others, other-&s;ome thought my &s;purres an antick.

<P>But more u&s;efull to our intellect, is the long time famous'd Mountaine <HI>Albors,</HI> neere this place; infamous in the Pyree~ or Temple of Idolatrous Fyre, which has never gone out for fifty Ages. <HI>Strabo</HI> in his fifteen and <HI>Procopius</HI> in his &s;econd book of the warrs and jarrs in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> remember it: <HI>Ben-Ionas</HI> al&s;o, a vagabond Jew records it. Within the Fane (round and low) is an Altar elevated five &s;teps from the ground: afore this Altar is a Trench or ditch, wherein the Fyre-god is placed; a fire not as is other elementall fire, fed by cumbu&s;tibles; but of that, <HI>Prometheus</HI> &s;tole from <HI>Don-Phoebus</HI> Cart-wheeles, or which <HI>Zertoo&s;t</HI> their Law-giver &s;tole from heaven, (a cabala of equall truth, and chu&s;e you which likes you be&s;t) and is, no doubt in imitation of the Jewi&s;h fire which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> comman|ded &s;hould never bee extingui&s;ht or prophan'd, 6 <HI>Levit.</HI> 13, the Devill ever frameing his wor&s;hip (to make it better accounted of) after the be&s;t patterne. In this Tophet, they commonly immolated their little children, and &s;omtimes men of more yeers than di&s;cretion, thinking by this volunta|ry to purcha&s;e an (iron) crowne, of (helli&s;h) martyrdome. After he had vow'd him&s;elfe to bee a &s;acrifice, his friends in great troopes, and with no le&s;&s;e joy flockt about him; clapping him on the &s;houlders with this greeting. Hayle, ble&s;&s;ed man! When? when wilt thou burne thy impure carca&s;&s;e, to have it purg'd &amp; made glorious in Paradize? he appoints a day, and they prepare towards the ceremony: the time being come, they a&s;|&s;emble at his gate; &amp; he i&s;&s;ues crown'd with garlands; they mount him upon a Mule, (for after hee has vow'd, hee mu&s;t no more honour the profane earth with his foot-&s;teps) the <HI>Ie&s;op</HI> annoints him with a hallowed oyle, and after many loving farewells, he incinerates in flame to a&s;hes. Ere his chil|dren depart, or mu&s;ick cea&s;e roaring, the Prie&s;t having con&s;ulted with the Devill, tells them their duty; bids them &s;anctifie them&s;elves, and provide a co&s;tly banquet again&s;t &s;uch a day, when their fathers gho&s;t means to vi&s;it them: they leap for joy, and think each houre a day till the time accom|pli&s;hes. At la&s;t old Satan comes, that &s;ubtle lyar, and in their fathers &s;hape or phanta&s;me, enters among&s;t them, and at &s;ome di&s;tance deludes their eyes, and readily &s;atisfies their curio&s;ities; they inquire how Paradize con|tents him; hee replies, by pro&s;pect it is a garden of &s;uch delights as are ineffable, but as yet cannot po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e it. They aske why? he tells them, becau&s;e his will is unperformed; they aske who he left it with, the Prie&s;t produces it: the tenor is of one note, his goods mu&s;t be divided into three, the Altar one, the Prie&s;ts another, his children a third: without which &s;pell the gho&s;t affrights them ever after.

<P>In this place, five and twenty yeere ago, lived one <HI>Meleck Bahaman,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Late co~que&s;t of Mount-Taurus.</NOTE> who like a &s;econd <HI>Pluto</HI> commanded many hills and dales in <HI>Gelack</HI> and <HI>Taurus;</HI> a King, albeit confined to the middle region, mo&s;t commonly for|ced with great co&s;t and care to uphold his dignity again&s;t Tartar and Per|&s;ian his great co&s;t and quarrel&s;ome neighbours: yet &s;uch was his good fortune, policy, valour, and mutuall love twixt him and his &s;ubjects, that though often invaded, he &s;tood &s;ecure, yea, lived to heare the ruine of many, his late enemies; his only aime tending to pre&s;erve what his predece&s;&s;ors had ju&s;tly made him heyre unto, and that his gray hayres might go in peace to an eternall dormitory. Thus thought <HI>Bahaman,</HI> and added his endeavors to compleat his thoughts. But <HI>Abbas</HI> the ambitious Per&s;ian, returning from the conque&s;t of <HI>Mozendram</HI> (forcing <HI>Shalley-mirza</HI> &s;onne of King <HI>Ab|dalla-cawn</HI> to become his pentioner) looks up upon <HI>Taurus</HI> which &s;eemed to threaten his undaunted heart, and vowes to bee no longer bearded by that mountanous King, taking his Motto out of <HI>Tacitus, id aequius quod va|lidius;</HI> charging him al&s;o that from his lofty dwelling hee peered into his two Kingdomes <HI>Medya</HI> and <HI>Mozendram,</HI> by that advantage ran&s;acking his Townes, robbing his <HI>Carravans,</HI> illuring his wormes, anticipating his progre&s;&s;e to the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, and diverting many rivers into other &s;ources; which &s;pringing upon <HI>Taurus,</HI> &s;tream'd gallantly into <HI>Hyrcania</HI> &amp; <HI>Shervan,</HI> without who&s;e felicitating, tho&s;e Provinces became barren and barbarous. <HI>Meleck Bahaman</HI> readily an&s;wers <HI>Abbas,</HI> and finds his drift, comparing him to that fable of the Wolfe who drinking at the &s;pring-head, quarrelled with the &s;illy Lambe for troubling his draught by quenching his flagrant thir&s;t at the &s;tream below. Whiles <HI>Abbas</HI> in an impatient delay re&s;olves to try the chance of war, appointing <HI>Methiculibeg</HI> with an army of Coo|&s;el-ba&s;hawes to perfect his de&s;ignes, and not to de&s;cend thence without victory.</P>
<P>It could not be &s;o &s;ecretly intended, but aged <HI>Bahaman</HI> has intelligence of his immediate purpo&s;es. At fir&s;t it troubled him, in that his gray haires were more propen&s;e to ea&s;e than tumult. Yet, le&s;t his &s;ubjects from his

example might be di&s;couraged, he throwes away his dull thoughts, and as a common father provides for &s;afety, in armes and victualls furni&s;hing his large Cittadell for many yeares &s;iege, yea, omitting nothing that might in|title him a carefull and expert Souldier. In each defen&s;ive place he plants a Garri&s;on, and makes every part naked and comfortle&s;&s;e where the Ene|mie might march, that in nothing he might be advantagious to the Per&s;ian. That done, he mews him&s;elfe, his Queene, two &s;onnes, and ten thou&s;and able men in his defended Ca&s;tle, not fearing any thing they could attempt again&s;t him. The Per&s;ian generall with thirty thou&s;and men mount up|wards and at their fir&s;t a&s;cent, find the way &s;o tedious, made more dange|rous by many di&s;mall &s;howres of Darts and &s;tones thundering on them, that they grumbled at &s;uch &s;tratagems, and would needs tumble downe againe, till <HI>Methiculibeg</HI> by many promi&s;es of reward, and expo&s;ing his owne head in the front of danger drew them up, and after &s;ome petty skir|mi&s;hes, incampt him&s;elfe before this Ca&s;tle; where he was told, the King and victory was included. When they had long viewd this inacce&s;&s;ible fortre&s;&s;e, they halfe di&s;paired of &s;ubduing it. Such was the height of that Ca&s;tle, and &s;uch the perpendicular a&s;cent, two excellent defences Art and Nature had inricht it with. Some Attempts he made, invalidable; to &s;hoot their Arrowes at it, was one with ayming at the Moone. Small &s;hott they had and many Lances, but of &s;mall force to batter rocks; &s;o that after ma|ny tedious bravadoes (wherein the Per&s;ian had &s;tones for payment) the Generall, finding force not valuable, turnes Matchiavillian. He &s;ummons them above to parlee with him; which granted, he a&s;&s;aults them with ma|ny prote&s;tations of truce and friend&s;hip. And that hee might the better &s;hadow truth, pre&s;ents the aged King with choi&s;e Tulipants, Sham&s;heers, Pearles, and other guilded baits, meane enough to angle for a Kingdome, intreating him to de&s;cend and ta&s;te a banquet: &s;olemnly &s;wearing by <HI>Mor|tus Ally,</HI> the head of <HI>Shaw Abbas,</HI> by Paradi&s;e, by eight tran&s;parent Orbs, and other panym atte&s;tations, that he &s;hould have royall quarter, come and goe as plea&s;ed him; no other rea&s;on inducing his invitation, than a hearty good will hee bore him, and hopes of agreement upon parlee. The peace|full King, unu&s;ed to deceit and warres rotten &s;tratagems, &s;wallowes the tempting hook, and is credulous they had no perfidy. His wife and &s;onnes di&s;&s;wade, adding fre&s;h examples of their hypocri&s;ie. But neither tho&s;e nor the teares his men &s;hed to beg his &s;tay, vowing their con&s;tancie to the la&s;t man, could divert his de&s;tiny: but downe he goes and findes the Crocodile below ready to embrace him with teares of joy: but after a &s;hort banquet, gives him an iron bed; regarding neither vow, honour, nor ingagement. <HI>Bahaman</HI> too late repents his dotage. The Pagan Generall thinks all his owne now, and therefore &s;ends his &s;onne a me&s;&s;age of intreaty upon a Speares point, that if they wi&s;ht their fathers &s;afety, an end of warre, truce with <HI>Abbas,</HI> and new Grandeur to their fortunes, they &s;hould come down; all which by ob&s;tinacie would be forfeited and denied them, yea prove a ba&s;is of perpetuall trouble, and a common monumentall &s;hame unto po|&s;terity.</P>

Three dayes pa&s;&s;ed, ere <HI>Mahomet-Ally-beg</HI> would vouch&s;afe to returne the Letter, or give that &s;ati&s;faction he had promi&s;ed; at length he came and told the Amba&s;&s;adour that the King had lookt upon it, had denied it to be his, and in a great rage had burnt it; wi&s;hing Sir <HI>Robert Sherley</HI> would depart his Kingdome, be|cau&s;e (old, and as hee thought) trouble&s;om. It was in vaine to chalenge the pragmatique Pagan in point of honour, nor knew he any recour&s;e by ju&s;tice to ea&s;e him&s;elfe. We all were verily per&s;waded, he never &s;hew'd it to the King, nor had any way enquired of him concerning it. The truth is, he had beene brib'd, but by whom, is unnece&s;&s;arie to &s;peak of, it may be wee did but conjecture it; yet no doubt, <HI>Abbas</HI> was hereby too much de|famed; his ju&s;tice, and di&s;cretion, and courage would have proceeded otherwi&s;e: be&s;ides, his prote&s;tation again&s;t <HI>Nogdibeg</HI> (as wee have noted) and <HI>Ebrahym Chan</HI> his &s;onne, not daring to &s;hew him&s;elfe in Court, till <HI>Synall Chan</HI> mediated his peace, (not that he, but his Father had offended) made it as apparant as the Sunne, that there was jugling: the truth is, Sir <HI>Robert Sherley's</HI> old age and di&s;ability to &s;erve the Per&s;ian,

made them &s;leight and ca&s;hier his pen&s;ion; even then when hee mo&s;t ex|pected thanks and other acknowledgements. But, &s;uch is the weak na|ture of man, e&s;pecially when they tru&s;t too much upon worldly Princes or any arme of fle&s;h, that God is angry: for thereby we rely too &s;trongly upon &s;econdarie helps, and contemne in &s;ome &s;ort, Gods gracious provi|dence: hence came tho&s;e di&s;contents, nay that arrow of Death that arre|&s;ted him; the 13 of July (and in le&s;&s;e than a fortnight after our entring <HI>Ca&s;byn</HI>) he gave this mi&s;erable &amp; fickle world an <HI>ultimum vale</HI> in his great clymacterick: and (wanting a fitter place of buriall) we intombed him un|der the thre&s;hold of his owne hou&s;e in this Citie, without much ceremo|nie. Hee was brother to two active Gentlemen Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> and Sir <HI>Tho|mas Sherleys:</HI> a family not needing hyperboles. Hee was the greate&s;t tra|veller in his time, and no man had eaten more &s;alt than he, none had more reli&s;ht the mutabilities of Fortune.

<P>At what time her beloved Lord lay dead, and &s;he halfe dead through a long di&s;&s;entery, to comfort her (after the fa&s;hion of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI>) one <HI>Iohn</HI> a Dutch man, a Jew, a Painter; regarding neither her &s;ex, her faith, her melancholly; complots with <HI>Mamet-Ally-beg</HI> to undoe her, by pretending a deepe engagement her husband was in to one <HI>Crole</HI> a Flemmin, &amp; (know|ing hee was dead) bad her ask him if it were not true; if hee denied it, it &s;hould be forfeited. She might have pay'd them by like Sophi&s;try, that if he would affirme it, &s;he would pay it them. But, they ha&s;te to the Caw&s;ee or Ju&s;tice to attach her goods, and a faithfull hone&s;t Gentleman of our company has quick notice of it, Mr. <HI>Robert Hedges</HI> by name, who ha&s;tens to her hou&s;e and per&s;wades her to make quick conveyance: at which, the amazed Lady tears the Sattin quilt &s;he lay upon, and with her feeble hands &s;hewes that pathetique vertue a &s;tronger could not well have bettered; and taking thence a Cabinet, &s;ome Jewells and rich Jems, intreats that worthy Gentleman to &s;afegard them, till the danger was gone: he readily obeyes, and is no &s;ooner out of doores, when <HI>Iohn</HI> the Boor enters with &s;upercilious looks, attended by &s;ome Pagan Sergeants, who (without much talk to her, or pitty to her di&s;tre&s;&s;e) rifled about, broke-ope her Che&s;ts, and carried away what was valuable or vendible; &s;ome rich Ve&s;ts, co&s;tly Tarbants, and a Dagger of great price; but finding no Jewells (&s;uch they had &s;eene him weare, and the Oe&s;trich Feather al&s;o, which they had wooried in their O&s;trich appetite) they grew madded with &s;hame, and made her Hor&s;es, Camells, and A&s;&s;es beare them company, not caring if the Lady &s;tarved. The Gentleman, &s;o &s;oone as the skie was cleare, re|turn'd, and be&s;ides his words of comfort, gladded her heart in delivering her her Jewels againe, of double value by that conque&s;t: without which good hap, I am per&s;waded her other fortune reacht not to fifty pound: a &s;mall revenue for &s;o brave a Lady; and e&s;pecially u&s;efull is money in tho&s;e uncharitable Regions, where women are made &s;laves to libidinous Pa|gans: but God provided better for her, and (beyond our expectation) has placed her in <HI>Rome,</HI> where I heare &s;hee now mo&s;t happily enjoyes her &s;elfe.</P>

&s;mall friend; and according to his worth let others know him. His birth|place is <HI>Parthia</HI> (from <HI>Parah</HI> to fructifie,) his Almuten was calculated, the a&s;pects found happy; If from a Co&s;termonger to bee next the King may be call'd happy: and in him the matchavillyan motto was approved, a dram of good fortune is better than a pound of vertue. In that happy minute of all minutes, <HI>Abbas</HI> by accident ca&s;t his eye upon him; a magick infu&s;ion it had it &s;eemes, for from the Apple-basket, he is roab'd in gold, and quickly made the Magnet of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> his yeerely revenue at our be|ing there, I heard by many men e&s;timated a hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds &s;terlin: and well may bee, not any Mirza, Cawn, Sultan, nor Beg|lerbeg that depended upon the Pot-&s;haughs &s;miles, but in an awfull com|plement, made him their Anchor by &s;ome annuall pi&s;ca&s;h, bribe, or other: his pre&s;ence was very comly, and taking; of a &s;weet countenance, made amiable by many complementall &s;miles: hee is of a big full body; large eyes and no&s;e; and huge mu&s;tachoes: was at this time aged forty, a third part of which hee had beene Fortunes minion. But no &s;ooner was old <HI>Abbas</HI> by bold death &s;truck from the helme of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and young <HI>Soffy</HI> his Grand-&s;onne made the royall Stear-man, but his &s;upercilious glances grew humbled, yea, his dazeling &s;plendor (eclip&s;t in the &s;etting of his Ma&s;ter) becomes quickly darkned: his late pride and avarice heaped all mens con|tempt upon him, in &s;o much as none now but dares to brand him with becoming Epethites; yea, his e&s;tate &s;o va&s;t that it threatned to pre&s;&s;e him to eternal co~fu&s;ion.

The&s;e are homely, tho&s;e full of exce&s;&s;e and braverie. <HI>Dyon</HI> and <HI>Cte&s;ias</HI> a&s;&s;ure us that in old times the Per&s;ian Mo|narchs made many fea&s;ts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fea&s;ts.</NOTE> &amp; u&s;ually invited fifteen thou&s;and men; in every entertainment expending foure hundred Talents, amounting in our mo|ney to two hundred and forty thou&s;and crownes: at private fea&s;ts when forty or fifty were received and no more (as <HI>Ephipius Olynthius</HI> records,) each &s;upper &s;tood him in a hundred Mynaes of gold, each mina or dina, in our money valuing &s;ix and twenty &s;hillings and eight pence: pretty in that juvenility of time (for we &s;ay <HI>plures opes nunc &s;unt, &amp;c</HI>) yet credible when we con&s;ider the va&s;t revenue of the Per&s;ian Empire in tho&s;e dayes extract|ing Tribute from many Nations; For, what accrued out of tho&s;e twentie Provinces, was not le&s;&s;e than forty thou&s;and and five hundred Attique or Euboick Talents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crowne re|venue.</NOTE> in our &s;ummes forty hundred thou&s;and crowns or there abouts: therfore might they ea&s;ily lavi&s;h out &s;uch prodigious expences. Out of <HI>Indya</HI> al&s;o they yearely received three hundred and three&s;core Talents of gold. The crowne revenue at this day is little le&s;&s;e, (albeit the juri&s;|diction royall be not halfe &s;o &s;patious) and amounts to mighty &s;ummes: <HI>Ta|hamas Anno Dom.</HI> 1560 received eight millions of crownes, gathered from fifty Sultans who farm'd his in-comes; be&s;ides an annuall pre&s;ent or tribute of 20000 crownes <HI>Leventhibeg</HI> a <HI>Georgian</HI> Prince, never fail'd to &s;end him: and 12000 hor&s;e the Curdyes 'twixt the two Seas al&s;o ea&s;ed him of pay|ment: and <HI>Abbas</HI> at this day from &s;ilk, tribute, and exactions, receives yeare|ly above nine millions: foureteene millions and 280000 florins &s;ome &s;ay, 357000 Tomans in Per&s;ian money, in ours 1190000 pound &s;terlin: And

<P>The men account it no &s;mall &s;hame to urine &s;tanding, but call &s;uch dogs rather than Mu&s;&s;ulmen; we beleeve them: they mundifie their genitors after it, and to that end have Slaves every where attending them with Ewers of &s;ilver to clean&s;e pollution: they hate to &s;ee men walk: &s;uch they think mad; a madder thing to &s;ee them ride tho not a &s;tones-ca&s;t journey.</P>

<HEAD>The Religion of the Per&s;ians.</HEAD>
<P>THE Per&s;ian Religion at this day varies not from the Turks in any particle of the Alcoran; and yet they account one the other He|reticks, and are no le&s;&s;e zealous and divided in their profe&s;&s;ion, than wee and the Papalins: a devi&s;ion begun <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1400, by a Syet of <HI>Ar|doveil</HI> (a Citie in <HI>Media;</HI>) the better to advance the Sophyan Title to the Crowne, derived from <HI>Mortis Ally</HI> their famous predece&s;&s;or, co&s;en and &s;onne in law to <HI>Mahumet:</HI> which <HI>Ally,</HI> albeit hee had ju&s;t right to &s;it as Kalyph at <HI>Mecca</HI> next to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> yet in his de&s;pight, three other men &s;tept up before him; and during their lives kept him in &s;laverie, and with|&s;tood him. The&s;e three, <HI>Abuboker, Omer,</HI> &amp; <HI>Ozman,</HI> are by the Turks mo&s;t venerably accounted of; but by the Per&s;ians (as appeares by their cur&s;ing them in a prayer made by <HI>Syet Gunet</HI>) as impo&s;tors, doggs, and hereticks; whereby is &s;own &s;uch mortall hatred betwixt the&s;e two potent Monarchs that (to Europs good) they abominate each other with implacable hatred.</P>
<P>MAHOMET, (&s;onne of <HI>Abdar</HI> a Pagan, and <HI>Emma</HI> a Jew) was borne at <HI>Iathreb</HI> (or <HI>Itrarip, Iezrab</HI> in <HI>Postellus,</HI> now <HI>Medyna</HI>) in <HI>Arabia,</HI> the yeere from the Creation 4544, of Chri&s;t our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour 574: <HI>Iu|&s;tinian</HI> at that time commanding the Roman Empire, and <HI>Cozrhoes</HI> (father to <HI>Hormizda</HI>) the Per&s;ians.</P>
<P>His parents being mean and poore, he was forced to &s;erve an appren|ti&s;hip, and with much patience &s;erved <HI>Zayed-ben-Hartah</HI> a rich and famous Merchant; who dying, left his &s;ervant &s;o good a legacie, that <HI>Mahomet</HI> was thought worthy any woman in <HI>Mecca:</HI> but by rea&s;on of tho&s;e ince&s;|&s;ant broyles commenc't by <HI>Cozrhoe</HI> and inflamed by the Romans, Traffick decayed, and mo&s;t men danc't to the &s;hrill brazen &s;ound of <HI>Bellonaes</HI> mu|&s;ick; <HI>Mahomet</HI> among&s;t the re&s;t &s;erving for pay fir&s;t with <HI>Heraclius,</HI> and then the Per&s;ian; not caring much who was victor, &s;o he was on the &s;afe&s;t &s;ide, by both their confu&s;ion to plot &s;ome way or other to advance him&s;elfe, both in a terrhen dignity and as a Deity: nor did he erre in his prediction; for what by his great e&s;tate and good fortune in the warres, he &s;oone threw off the qualitie of a common man, and got a companie; yea at length an Armie of &s;o many Tattars and Arabians, that he dared to a&s;&s;ault the infeebled Chri&s;tians, and became victor; yea, by &s;tratagem (mingling with the credulous and gladded Per&s;ians) upon a watch-word cut a&s;under and confounded the Per&s;ian Armie. Which done, hee blu&s;ht not to extoll him&s;elfe to all his troops, deciphering the mi&s;ery of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and horror of <HI>Roman</HI> bondage; acquainting them al&s;o with the great di&s;|cord 'mong&s;t Chri&s;tians; of that inhumane villanie perpetrated upon <HI>Mau|ritius</HI> by <HI>Phocas</HI> (then Emperour) his dete&s;ted &s;ervant, and of Pope <HI>Boni|face's</HI> u&s;urpation of the title of Univer&s;all Bi&s;hop; contrary to the good will of all the World, and what Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the great had lately bran|ded <HI>Iohn</HI> the Con&s;tantinopolitan Patriack with, as the Antichri&s;t; in that &s;ixtie &s;ix good Bi&s;hops of <HI>Rome</HI> from <HI>Lynus</HI> (&s;even yeeres after the pa&s;&s;i|on) to that Pope then teaching, never de&s;ired it. That hee him&s;elfe was
<PB N="252" REF="132">
ordained from the begining of the world to eclip&s;e the pride of that Pope, to in&s;truct the world in a better and more plau&s;ible way than either <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did the Jewes, or <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> the Chri&s;tians; that hee was the Comforter pro|mi&s;ed (yet &s;ayes that he came to give his Law by the &s;word and not by mi|racles) and to advance the Arabians name and dignitie above all other Kingdomes in the Univer&s;e. The amazed Savages admire his boldne&s;&s;e, and (though &s;ome thought ba&s;ely of him) mo&s;t part hoping hee could ef|fect his promi&s;es, give credit to him and atttend his revelations.</P>
<P>But ere he could fini&s;h his new moulded work, the inraged Per&s;ian &s;ud|denly &s;teales among them and in memory of their late kindne&s;&s;e, retaliates them &s;o fiercely, that <HI>Mahomet</HI> (to &s;ave his life) po&s;ts away, leaving the re&s;t to the mercile&s;&s;e furie of the Per&s;ian.</P>
<P><HI>Mahomet</HI> with a &s;ad heart arrives &s;afely in <HI>Mecca</HI> (<HI>Mocura</HI> and <HI>Muny|chiates</HI> in old writers, the Arabian Metropolis:) but when he cals to mind his mi&s;erable e&s;tate, by this la&s;t defeat being cheated of his moneys and men, yea &s;uch men as hee had prepar'd to help forwards his ambition, hee con&s;umes in the meditation, and by his faint-heartedne&s;&s;e and con&s;tant vexing had doubtle&s;&s;e made Death his executioner, had not Satan phy&s;icke him.</P>
<P>Some &s;afer way he intends to take, than in <HI>Mars</HI> his rugged fields, &s;o full of co&s;t and blood-&s;hed. And therefore in the fir&s;t place, to &s;olace his un|quiet &s;pirits &amp; inrich him&s;elfe, he laies &s;eige to <HI>Chodaige</HI> or <HI>Aediga</HI> a woman of great wealth and wor&s;hip, by &s;ome thought Queene of <HI>Cora&s;an;</HI> whom after a few amorous a&s;&s;aults he won, and of her begot three &s;onnes and foure daughters, named <HI>Ebrahim, Tajeb,</HI> and <HI>Taher</HI> (all three dying young) <HI>Fatyma</HI> and <HI>Zaynab</HI> (both married to <HI>Mortis Ally;</HI>) <HI>Om-Kalthom</HI> and <HI>Rachya,</HI> wives to old <HI>Abuboker. Mahomets</HI> &s;tomack grew weak, and one &s;ort of meat begun to loath him, <HI>Chodaige</HI> was &s;tale, and others fancied him: he therefore purpos'd in his Law (then in hatching) to allow all &s;orts of car|nall liberty: and to incourage them by his example, &s;olemnly (as <HI>Ben Ca|&s;en</HI> a writer of his beleife &s;ayes) e&s;pou&s;ed <HI>Ay&s;ce</HI> the beloved child of his &s;onne in law <HI>Abubocher:</HI> a child (though <HI>Mahomets</HI> wife) I well may call her, at that time not exceeding &s;ix yeeres old; yet &s;o pliable to the de|lights of her wanton husband, that hee calls her his be&s;t beloved, and dictates a whole chapter to her prai&s;es; &s;o that for her affection to him, her courte&s;ie to others, her witty conceits, her skil in hi&s;tory and language, &s;he is intituled Mother of the Faithfull; and (contrarie to his tenet in his Alcoran) in who&s;e grave (hoping there al&s;o to imbrace her) <HI>Mahomet</HI> de&s;ired to be buried, as was by old <HI>Abubocher</HI> afterwards performed</P>
<P>His third wife was <HI>Miriam</HI> (or <HI>Mamrya</HI>) of whom he begot <HI>Ebrahim Ca&s;|&s;en,</HI> who at the age of &s;ix months, by the arrow of grim death was directed the inevitable way of his brethren. <HI>Zaynab</HI> (the repudiate of <HI>Ben-Har|tah Mahomets</HI> ma&s;ter) was <HI>Mahomets</HI> fourth and la&s;t wife (concubines hee had above a hundred, but in any Author I find not named) a Lady of &s;ingular perfection, and &s;o credulous of his feigned vi&s;ions (and that his epilep&s;ie was caus'd by an Angells glory, oft conferring with him) that by all Mahomitans &s;he is al&s;o named a &s;econd Mother of Mu&s;&s;ulmen or true beleevers.</P>

This was in his great clymacteric 63, of the <HI>Hegira</HI> 17, and of our Saviour 637, ordaining <HI>Ally</HI> to &s;ucceed him, and his Carca&s;&s;e to be placed in <HI>Ai&s;ces</HI> grave in <HI>Iathrip</HI> which <HI>per Antono|ma&s;iam</HI> he new named <HI>Medina Talnabi;</HI> it or <HI>Mecca,</HI> in my opinion, being that <HI>Munichyates</HI> in <HI>Ptolomy;</HI> but I rather think <HI>Mecca</HI> it, becau&s;e I read that <HI>Medina</HI> (or <HI>Iathrep</HI>) was built <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 364. by <HI>Aadhuddaule</HI> then King of <HI>Babylon:</HI> and by <HI>O&s;man</HI> allegorically call'd <HI>El-haramain,</HI> and by others <HI>De-A'&s;alem</HI> i.e. a holy place or Town of mercy, none daring in the garb or language of a &s;oldyer tread Ea&s;t, We&s;t, North, or South, nigher than &s;ix one way, twelve, eighteene, and twenty foure miles the other; upon paine of death and eternall di&s;plea&s;ure.

Yet denyes him be to the &s;onne of God, but that the Virgin conceiv'd by &s;melling to a Ro&s;e pre&s;ented her by <HI>Gabriel;</HI> and that he was borne out of her brea&s;ts.

In another, hee a&s;&s;ures his Pro|&s;elites, that <HI>Mecca, Medina,</HI> and <HI>Ieru&s;alem</HI> be holy Cities, built by <HI>Adam</HI> in Paradize, but fram'd in heaven: &amp; thence it is, that <HI>Ieru&s;alem</HI> is by Turks as well as Chri&s;tians, honoured: foure Cities &s;prung out of hell at the birth of <HI>Mahomet</HI> (at which, time all Idolls fell, and <HI>Lucifer</HI> was throwne into hell, &s;o deep into that abi&s;&s;e, as hee was &s;ome yeeres ere he could get up againe) the names of tho&s;e devilli&s;h Townes are (as plea&s;es <HI>Mahomet</HI> to &s;ay) <HI>Elmedin</HI> in <HI>Caldea, Antioch</HI> in <HI>Syria, Va&s;tat</HI> in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and <HI>Eh-beram</HI> in <HI>Armenia:</HI> Places, it &s;eemes which had refu&s;ed him and his learned Do|ctrine.</P>

Angells, and Saints; of judgement, the re&s;urrection, joy and paine, &amp;c. of which I will afford you a compendium for Mu&s;&s;ulmen to beleeve, for us to laugh at.

I come to fetch thee: the God whom thou &s;o zealou&s;ly wor&s;hippe&s;t, de&s;ires to &s;ee thee at his owne &s;tation. <HI>Mahomet</HI> rejoyces, and going to mount upon the Angells wings (of which hee had &s;eventy p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">ire) is hindred: he asks which way he &s;hould take towards heaven, the Angel &s;hewes him a huge A&s;&s;e, <HI>Albarack</HI> by name, and bids him mount upon him; which <HI>Mahomet</HI> e&s;&s;aying could not doe, till hee had prayed for him. From <HI>Mecca</HI> hee po&s;ted (in the twinckling of an eye, for <HI>Barack</HI> at foure &s;teps had done it) to <HI>Hieru&s;alem:</HI> there, the Angell di&s;mounted him, and took him into his owne protection. In few minutes <HI>Mahomet</HI> a&s;cended heaven, and was let in by <HI>Gabryel</HI> the Porter there. From one heaven to another is a travell of five hundred yeares; howbeit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Heaven</NOTE> <HI>Mahomet</HI> glanc't through the &s;even in a moment. In all which Orbs hee &s;aw many &s;trange things; but fir&s;t take notice what mettall the Orbs are made of. The fir&s;t is of refined &s;ilver, and wherein all the glittering &s;tarres are fixt with chains of burni&s;ht bra&s;&s;e: in this heaven he &s;aw a Cock &s;o great that &s;tand|ing upon the Moon, his cox-comb reacht into the imperiall heaven, many millions of miles altitude: every time that this Cock crowed, all other Chanticlears upon earth, re-ecchoed him. The &s;econd heaven is of gold, &s;uch gold as has beene &s;even times tried in the fire. The third is of pearle; in this heaven hee &s;aw innumerable troops of Saints and Angells; each of them &s;aluted him by his name, and he prayed for them. Among&s;t the re&s;t he took notice of <HI>Adam, Enoch, Abraham, Samuel, David, Salomon,</HI> &amp;c. all whom he knew by revelation; and of which, &s;ome he taxed, others hee commended as occa&s;ion &s;erved him. The fourth heaven, is of Smaragd, and where he &s;aw infinite companies of other Angells who made a mighty noi&s;e and ince&s;&s;antly prai&s;ed God: and well they might make a noi&s;e, for (&s;ayes <HI>Mahomet</HI>) every Angell there, was a thou&s;and times bigger than the globe of the earth; and each had ten thou&s;and heads; every head, three|&s;core and ten thou&s;and tongues; and every tongue prai&s;ed God in &s;even hundred thou&s;and &s;everall languages: among&s;t them, he noted one e&s;pe|cially, <HI>Phatyr,</HI> or the Angell of Mercie; a creature of that va&s;t frame that every &s;tep he trod was twelve times more than the di&s;tance is twixt both the Poles. <HI>Mahomet</HI> inquired of him why he wept &s;o fiercely; the Angell replied, that it was out of his compa&s;&s;ion to &s;ee the deplorable e&s;tate and vanity of man. This is that &s;ame Angell that has the Holy Quill or pen in keeping; a pen of orient Pearle; &s;o long, that an excellent Arabian Cour|&s;er in five hundred yeeres continuall galloping, can hardly reach to the further end of it: with this pen, God regi&s;ters all things pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come; the Inck he writes with, is pure Light; the Character &s;o mi&s;te|rious, that none but he and <HI>Seraphael</HI> can under&s;tand it.

The fifth heaven was of Diamonds: where hee &s;aw a mighty Angell, and of all others the wi&s;e&s;t: hee had as many heads and tongues and voyces as any two others had in the inferior Orbe; and had the keeping of that Book, wherein all men in the world have their names written: he did nothing but turne over the leaves and blot out one name or another, for by that (as by the arrow of death) they died &s;uddenly.

wor&s;hipped: the frame was round, re&s;embling heaven; his head was wreathed with the Sun; the rayes &s;pread them&s;elves to the umbelique or navell of the image: on one &s;ide was the Sun againe depicted, on th'other the Moone and Starres, his brother and &s;i&s;ters; and under his feet, the An|gels with Crownes and Scepters, attending him: bat albeit the work was rare and the materiall of refined gold; yet did the good Emperour throw, it into the fire to incorporate it with his Diety. <HI>Co&s;rhoes</HI> by this had ga|thered a fre&s;h Armie out of <HI>Hyrcarnia,</HI> and bids <HI>Shae-Rablecca</HI> to forrage <HI>Al|bania:</HI> but they &s;tood &s;o excellently upon their defence that <HI>Rablacca</HI> re|turnes till <HI>Sarbaras</HI> with new forces forc't him back; and much hurt que&s;ti|onle&s;&s;e had they done had not <HI>Heraclius</HI> &s;peedily entred and rooted them both in one day, yet neither knowing it. <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Prophet was in <HI>He|racliu's</HI> Armie till now: and about this time begins the Hegyra or flight of that fal&s;e Prophet from <HI>Mecca,</HI> who&s;e people threatned to kill him for his innovation and doctrine. <HI>Anna Dom.</HI> 622 and of the Emperours reigne 13, <HI>Sarbaras</HI> pa&s;t his Armie over <HI>Euphrates</HI> of purpo&s;e to trie the fortune of warre with <HI>Heraclius:</HI> who &s;o &s;oone as hee knew his intent gave him rea|&s;on to repent his arrogance: the good Emperour him&s;elfe di&s;charging his duty &s;o excellently &amp; with &s;uch excellent courage, that <HI>Sarbaras</HI> upon view of it cryed out thus to <HI>Co&s;ma</HI> his Companion, O <HI>Co&s;mal</HI> &s;ee&s;t thou with what courage the Emperour fights? certainly hee alone is able to vanqui&s;h all our multitudes.

But <HI>Co&s;rhoe</HI> &s;wels with pa&s;&s;ion, and combines with Lucifer, that by diabolicall Witchcraft he might vex the mi&s;erable Chri&s;tians, again&s;t whom hee raged with all &s;orts of cruelty: and ere he gave a farewell to this world, once more ventures a battell with the Romans: 150000 men he mu&s;ters up, and divides them in three; to <HI>Sayn</HI> one part, to <HI>Serbaras</HI> another, to him&s;elfe the re&s;t: ima|gining by &s;ome or all of the&s;e to doe wonders. <HI>Sayn</HI> with his 50000 went again&s;t the Emperour. <HI>Sarbaras</HI> with his 50000 marcht to <HI>Con&s;tantinople:</HI> and <HI>Co&s;rhoe</HI> &s;tayes upon the frontiers. <HI>Heraclius</HI> divides his al&s;o into three; the one to ha&s;ten into <HI>Thrace,</HI> the other to be&s;tow a Cami&s;ado upon <HI>Sayns</HI> Quarter, the la&s;t hee led him&s;elfe into the Lazic Territories: to which place the Gazarrs (a &s;ort of Turk) came to &s;erve him: <HI>Theodore</HI> in &s;mall time rais'd <HI>Sayns</HI> Armie, his Chry&s;olocae; a&s;&s;i&s;ted by hayle from heaven, &s;o direfully thundring on them, that all men there, &s;aw that God fought for them. <HI>Sayn</HI> was a &s;laine in that battell; but in &s;tead of a decent buriall, the Per&s;ian Tyrant array'd his carca&s;&s;e in raggs, per&s;umed him with dogs turds, and &s;la&s;ht his &s;ence&s;&s;e trunck into a thou&s;and peeces. That yeare the Gazarrs (to gratifie <HI>Heraclius</HI>) under conduct of <HI>Ziebit</HI> broke through the Ca&s;pian &s;traits, and did the Per&s;ians much mi&s;chiefe, and to the Roman Armie expre&s;t no &s;mall affection. <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 626 <HI>Sarbaras</HI> with infinit troopes entred <HI>Thrace,</HI> pillg'd <HI>Calcedon,</HI> a towne built by <HI>Ia&s;on</HI> and <HI>Ar|gias,</HI> much traded to, in view of <HI>By&s;anth</HI> and upon the <HI>Bo&s;pherus.</HI> After that, they layd &s;iege to <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> and for ten dayes, ince&s;&s;antly laboured to enter it: but &s;uch was the excellent courage of the Chri&s;tians, &s;uch her naturall defence, that the Per&s;ians could not prevaile; but upon notice that <HI>Heraclius</HI> was approching, they rais'd their &s;iege &amp; retreated &s;hamfully.

<HI>Anno</HI> 628. the Roman Emperour entred <HI>Armenia,</HI> and in a long fought battell obtained a mervailous great victorie.

<P>So &s;oone as <HI>Heraclius</HI> heard of <HI>Co&s;rhoes</HI> death, he imagines all his quar|rells ended: that yeare therefore he travell'd to the holy Citie, and pre|&s;ented <HI>Zacharyas</HI> the then Patriarch with the Cro&s;&s;e of Chri&s;t, found by Saint <HI>Helena</HI> (a Brittani&s;h Lady) 3 May 326. and ravi&s;ht thence by <HI>Co&s;rhoes</HI> as I lately remembered.

<P>But <HI>Abbas</HI> (glad of all advantages to &s;poyle and conquer) takes the affront as done in his de&s;pight, in that <HI>Con&s;tandell</HI> was his &s;ubject and a Ma|hometan; and therefore &s;tudies their de&s;truction: but &s;uch good rea&s;ons <HI>Ally-cawn</HI> gave him to the contrary, that hee alters his fir&s;t intents, and &s;eekes by conferring his be&s;t love upon young <HI>Temerisk</HI> their Infant King to oblige their affection: and accordingly returned him into <HI>Georgia</HI> roy|ally attended, yea made him bee crowned King in <HI>Georgia,</HI> with all cere|mony requirable. But long the&s;e Halcyon dayes endured not; for the Grand Seniors Amba&s;&s;ador at <HI>Spahawn</HI> laboured by all wayes how to &s;epe|rate this their Union; &amp; by deceit effected it: Fir&s;t wi&s;pering in <HI>Temerisks</HI> eares that <HI>Abbas</HI> hated him; and then made <HI>Abbas</HI> beleeve that <HI>Temerisk</HI> was an undoubted creature of the Grand Seniors: &s;o that (upon <HI>Temerisks</HI> deniall to come to <HI>Abbas</HI>) he enters <HI>Georgia</HI> with 30000 hor&s;e, where <HI>Lol|la-beg,</HI> at his Ma&s;ters command, made fire and &s;word equally tyrannicall. <HI>Temerisk</HI> was forced to the Turk, from whom he got &s;uch forces, that hee re-entred <HI>Georgia,</HI> and &s;lew the Per&s;ique Garri&s;ons, yea forraged beyond <HI>Tephlys</HI> into <HI>Medya:</HI> which &s;o inraged <HI>Abbas</HI> that from <HI>Mo&s;endram</HI> he i&s;&s;ued with a greater Army than formerly, and in <HI>Georgia</HI> made a more terrible execution: firing their Churches, hou&s;es, and Mulberry-trees; de&s;troy|ing their &s;ilk-wormes, and ma&s;&s;acring young and old, without mercy. But &s;o &s;oone as <HI>Abbas</HI> was gone, <HI>Temerisk</HI> re-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his de&s;olate Countrey; and by a &s;tratagem of <HI>Morad-cawns,</HI> in &s;ome &s;ort requited the Per&s;ian: for <HI>Morad</HI> like another <HI>Zopyrus,</HI> deformes his face, flies to <HI>Cazbyn,</HI> and is welcomed: pretends that <HI>Temerisk</HI> had &s;o mutilated him; and that hee re&s;olved to betray him to the Per&s;ian. <HI>Abhas</HI> beleeves him, and &s;ends 12 famous Dukes and an Army along with him: but being upon the Geor|gian Confines, and knowing that the Per&s;ians were fearele&s;&s;e of danger, he i&s;&s;ues at midnight from his owne quarter upon them with 500 volun|tary Georgians (whom hee had appointed &s;hould accidentally proffer
<PB N="292" REF="151">
their &s;ervices) with &s;uch hideous clamours, that 11 of tho&s;e Dukes and 700 men were &s;laine; the re&s;t &s;o terribly affrighted, that they rather cho&s;e to dye any other death than hazard any more adventures among&s;t tho&s;e Chri&s;tians. Since which, <HI>Abbas</HI> (by meditation of his Co&s;el-ba&s;haws, who are mo&s;t of them Georgians) has firmed a &s;ure friend&s;hip with the Geor|gians.</P>
<P>If I &s;hould but memori&s;e his &s;everall victories again&s;t the Tartar, Geor|gian, Mogull, and Arabian; It would be enough to make a Book volumi|nous. But I promi&s;ed to weave no circum&s;tances: for if that could have beene accepted of, I had here al&s;o &s;poke his journey and warres of <HI>Arme|nia;</HI> and his tragick acts again&s;t his own children: which in regard I have el&s;ewhere glanced at, I have here pretermitted purpo&s;ely; this only be re|membred; That <HI>Sha-Abbas</HI> dyed <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1628. <HI>Heg.</HI> 1008. aged 70, having ruled the Per&s;ian Empire 43 yeeres; and was buried, part at <HI>Caz|byn,</HI> part at <HI>Ardaveel,</HI> in the Chappell where are intombed his famous and warlike Progenitors: And albeit in the infancy of his reigne he had beene Tyrannicall, yet &s;uch was the Maje&s;ty of his a&s;pect, his courage, policy, wi&s;|dome, &amp; good fortune in all his wars, that never any Prince before him was better beloved, and every way by all Symptoms of Duty and re&s;pect, more honoured. His Care to admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice; his Zeale to Strangers, whom he ever much regarded, and gave all &s;afety and priviledges to; it beeing his u&s;uall phra&s;e, that Strangers added e&s;pecially to the lu&s;tre of his Court, more than any Dome&s;tiq' magnificence; his Labour to increa&s;e Com|merce with other Nations; his Incouragement to Souldiers; his Indul|gence to Merchants of his owne Nation; and in a word, his great Know|ledge in Hi&s;tory and Philo&s;ophy, not only made him to bee adored by his owne, but admired at by Travellers; e&s;pecially when with him they com|pared other Emperours and Princes of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> who &s;uck with delight their native ignorance: and thence it was that <HI>Abbas</HI> went to his grave, with &s;uch generall lamentation as made it known that he was their Father, Pro|tector, and Emperour.</P>
<P>In his place was <HI>Sha-Soffy</HI> (<HI>Abbas</HI> his Grand-&s;onne) &s;aluted King; who&s;e fathers death and his brothers I have el&s;ewhere remembred.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Sha-Soffy</HI> I will &s;ay little, &s;ave that &s;ince his being King (albeit very young) hee has vanqui&s;ht the Turks 4 times: albeit twice the Grand-Seignior was in per&s;on to fight with him. Many of his Nobles hee has be|headed: but in the&s;e things argues his ju&s;t di&s;cent from <HI>Ally:</HI> and is as like|ly as any that reigned before him, to advance the Monarchy of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and every way to make it rich, and famous.</P>

<P><HI>Apr.</HI> 13.

For, <HI>Al|meyda</HI> &s;ome few yeares after by &s;tratagem recovered and burnt it to the ground: but by command of the <HI>Goan Vice-roy</HI> 'twas repaired, repopula|ted, and &s;tood victorious; till Captaine <HI>Hall</HI> (if I mi&s;take not the mans name) about nine yeeres agoe forced it; and made th'in&s;ulting Portugall know, how their bravadoes, to the Engli&s;h were no way formidable.</P>

<P>CHOUL (in <HI>Ptolmyes</HI> dayes call'd <HI>Comane,</HI> if <HI>Ca&s;taldus</HI> gue&s;&s;e right) is &s;ubject to like varietie: it is removed from the Aequi-noctiall 18 degrees 30 minuts North: and was ravi&s;ht from the Emperiall Dyadem of <HI>Decan</HI> (or <HI>Decanory</HI>) by <HI>Almeyda</HI> that ambitious Portugall in the yeare of our re|demption 1507, and in which (to perpetuate his Conque&s;t) hee erected a gallant Fort or Bulwark, &amp; planted it with Cannon: a Ca&s;tle al&s;o no le&s;&s;e fortified; &s;o terrible to the Indyans, as they have forborne to make them rore, doubting the very clamour may undoe them. The Inhabitants are a few melancholy but lu&s;tfull Portugalls, and &s;ome peacefull crafty Ban|nyans: it affoords naught el&s;e to be &s;poken on in this place. The Expedition bearing up to &s;peak with us, both &s;hips fell foule (to &s;peak in <HI>Neptunes</HI> lan|guage) or thwart one anothers houl&s;es; by which mi&s;chance her bole|&s;prit gave our mizzen &s;hrouds a churli&s;h ki&s;&s;e; but by a happy gale parted without farther inconvenience. After five dayes &s;ayle wee were Na|dyr to the Sunne, at that in&s;tant in our Vertic&eacute; or Zenyth; his decli|nation then being ju&s;t fifteene degrees; and we clo&s;e by the Ile incyrcling <HI>Goa,</HI> a gallant Citie, the Metropole and &s;eat of the Spani&s;h Viceroy and Archbi&s;hop, the Citie I have formerly de&s;cribed: ha&s;te wee therefore to other places. The wind was favourable a while; but ere long becalmed, whereby the ayre inflam'd, and Sea gave a fierie reflection; to &s;weat and live like Salamanders was no novel thing with us to &s;uffer bravely all mu|tations; <HI>Coelum non animum,</HI> was a verified Motto, and &s;erv'd in generall to comfort us. The three and twentieth of Aprill we got to <HI>Mangalore</HI> a Citie obeying the <HI>Mallabar,</HI> in who&s;e road wee found thirty or forty Fri|gads of <HI>Mallabar</HI> men of warre, who dur&s;t not in&s;ult upon their numbers, but choo&s;e rather to avoyd, and accordingly all together hoi&s;t &s;aile towards <HI>Goa;</HI> one onely mi&s;carrying, &s;uffering a while the <HI>Ionas</HI> her Barge to do|mineere, but after variable &s;trife by rowing and augmenting canva&s;&s;e got away, with &s;ome &s;hort in her &s;ide, and many wounded. That &s;ame night we came to an anchor in <HI>Mount Elly</HI> or <HI>Delyns</HI> bay, a Towne and Port ac|knowledging va&s;&s;alage to the Mallabar: wee rode in nine fadoms, not above three neerer the &s;hore. Gladly wee would have landed, but dur&s;t not be too prodigall of our beliefe; they &s;eemed willing, wee knew them treacherous; but &s;eeing wee had di&s;coverd their villany, they ventur'd aboard our &s;hips, they knew us mercifull: they fill'd their Canoes with Coco's, Mangoes, Jacks, greene Pepper, Caravance or Indyan Pea&s;e, Buf|falls, Fle&s;h, Henns, Eggs, and other things, &s;old us not at very ea&s;ie prices; but (what principally vext us) al&s;o made us pay for every tun of water a Ry|all or foure &s;hillings foure pence: and though they hand plenty of it, yet grudg'd exceedingly to &s;hew us any curte&s;ie in that common element, in fringing by that their barbari&s;me, the law of Nature and Nations; one of their owne religion (but more morall) &s;hall accu&s;e them.</P>

<P>The extent of <HI>Mallabar</HI> I have given you. The people generally are big limb'd, &s;trong, cole black, and weare their haire (more like wooll than haire) long, and curled; about their heads they wreath a &s;mall but curi|ous &s;ort of lynnen wrought with gold and &s;ilk: their wai&s;t is circled with a peece of Callico, which makes them mode&s;t ; from the thigh downward, and from their middle upwards, are &s;urely naked.

The women (&s;uch as credit <HI>Mahomet</HI>) vaile them|&s;elves like other Indyans: &s;uch as affect gentili&s;me covet nakedne&s;&s;ce: their greate&s;t ornament and pride is in their eares and no&s;es; they &s;uppo&s;e them mo&s;t brave, mo&s;t courtly, who can teare or dilacerate their eares wide&s;t (which they effect by many ponderous bables they hang there,) and ring their &s;nouts with &s;ilver, bra&s;&s;e, or Ivorie: their armes and leggs al&s;o are chained richly. The Ethnique marriages want not &s;uper&s;tition: where God is not knowne, the devill invelopes and traines them up in my&s;tique darkne&s;&s;e: one &s;ame ceremonie is ob&s;erved by King and Pe&s;ant.

It declines from the Aequator towards the North-Pole, eleven degrees: and from its &s;tanding in the burning Zone mu&s;t needs be hot, if not &s;ulphureous: the earth is but meanly fruitfull in gra&s;&s;e, <HI>Apollo</HI> eats it up; but, her gardens by indu&s;try and help of &s;ome brooks are green, &s;patious, and redundant in variety of choi&s;e fruits. The Citie it &s;elfe is large, but of no beauty: the hou&s;es are low, and thick, and dark: the har|bour is a pretty way di&s;tant from the Town, and but indifferent to anchor in: it &s;hewes two great Forts, built <HI>Anno</HI> 1515 by the Portugui&s;e; unfor|tified and in a &s;ort raized by the Mallabar; the <HI>Samoreen</HI> or Emperour in this place u&s;ually abiding: a Prince of great power and awe: black as the devill, and as treacherous: is al&s;o of his religion, and makes him heire to all his offrings.

The&s;e Chyne&s;es are men of peace, voluptuous, venereous, co&s;tly in their &s;ports, great game&s;ters, and in trading over &s;ubtle for young Chri|&s;tian merchants: oft-times they are &s;o wedded to dicing, that after they have lo&s;t their whole e&s;tate, wife and Children are &s;tak't and parted with; yet in little time by gleaning here and there, he will be able to redeeme them; if not, at the day, they are &s;old in the market.</P>
<P>The lavan Kings are five, (Viceroys I might better call them;) foure of them are &s;ubordinate to the <HI>Mattaran's</HI> command, who is able to bring unto the field 200000 de&s;perate &s;laves, black, but valiant: they have &s;mall order or pollicy in warre; yet dare attempt any thing, they are &s;o forward. The climate burnes &s;o fiercely, that little apparell plea&s;es them; mo&s;t, goe mo&s;t part naked: they u&s;e lances, darts, arrowes, and &s;hields; but their &s;ole braverie is in their crizes; a weapon, commonly two foot long, broad, waved, &s;harp edgd, and &s;mall pointed; but (again&s;t the lawes of Nature, and honour) ba&s;ely poi&s;oned: the hilt or handle is u&s;ually of wood or horne, (&s;ome have them of gold, &s;ilver, and Ivory) cut into the crooked &s;hape or figure of a deformed Pagod; yet were they a thou&s;and times more ugly, the&s;e &s;avages would dare to adore them; e&s;pecially, in that they aske the Idoll on their crea&s;t pardon, after they have perpetrated homycide or &s;uch like villany; a trick us'd by <HI>Lewes</HI>

<P>The&s;e people know better how to &s;wim than navigate; yet are not ig|norant in &s;ea affaires, nor want they ve&s;&s;els to doe mi&s;chiefe in. Their chiefe delight is hunting Tygres, Ounces, and &s;uch bea&s;ts as give cha&s;e and re&s;i&s;tance; They know <HI>Mahomet</HI> in &s;ome parts of the Ile, who as an infectious ayre is &s;uckt by many people of remote Ilands. Friendly they are to Engli&s;h men and delight to &s;erve them, e&s;pecially &s;ince the Duch forced <HI>Iacatra</HI> from them, betwixt whom is &s;uch mortall vari|ance that fifteen ryalls (is given by either) as a reward for each pri&s;oner dead or alive, either people can take nor is there ever hope of true Amity with Barbarians. The Oran-kays or be&s;t &s;ort of people here, are la&s;ie, &s;ociable, but not to bee too much tru&s;ted: they &s;uppo&s;e them|&s;elves de&s;cended from <HI>Chyna;</HI> in a Iunck 700 yeares ago forced hither by Tuffon or tempe&s;t. They are proud, and weare their hayre pretty long, and about their cri&s;pes wreath a valuable Sha&s;h or Tulipant; go naked to to the wa&s;t, where they gird them with a parti-coloured plad or mantle, falling no longer than the knees; and are impatient if any of|fer to touch their heads. The ordinary food had here (not at ea&s;ie rates) is ryce, wheat, pinange, betele, ophium, goates, egs, hens, coquos, plaintains, jacks, and rack-a-pee &s;o cald <GAP DESC="foreign">; which drunck immo|derately, accilerates Death; but temperately, exhilirates the heart, cures fluxes, kill wormes and helps dige&s;tion. To conclude.</P>
<P>Whence this great and noble Ile is called <HI>Iava,</HI> I confe&s;&s;e my ignorance. I dare not &s;ay from <HI>Iavan</HI> (<HI>Iaphets</HI> &s;onne) grand&s;on of <HI>Noah;</HI> in that mo&s;t agree, he planted <HI>Greece.</HI> But by rea&s;on his own brother <HI>Thar&s;is</HI> peopled the&s;e parts, why might he not from his brothers name (to eternize his me|mory) borrow the denomination. Nothing el&s;e &s;ave Pepper pre&s;ents it|&s;elfe in this Ile, worthy our nothing: Pepper is &s;owne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pepper.</NOTE> and in the growth &s;upported by poles or canes, about which it entwines and duplicates with many embraces, till by maturity it gets the &s;hape and &s;trength of a bu&s;hy, round, and plea&s;ant tree. The pepper hangs foure inches in length, and one about, in many clu&s;ters; each yeelding fifty or &s;ixtie cornes, full, round and fragrant; the &s;mooth is be&s;t accounted of.</P>
<P>The Cotton (more common in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Guzurat</HI>) is no le&s;&s;e memo|rable and u&s;efull. The tree is &s;lender, &s;treight, a yard high, and like a bryer;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cotter.</NOTE>

at the top it expands into many &s;everall branches; each, charg'd with ma|ny balls or cods conteining the Bumba&s;t or Cotton: the &s;hape is round, and equall in bigne&s;&s;e to a Walnut: at maturity the cod opens, &amp; di&s;clo&s;es her trea&s;ure; but being cropt, is put in an entire heap, and with flayles or &s;uch like u&s;efull (though churli&s;h) in&s;truments is forced out; and by the enriched owner cheerefully gathered.</P>
<P>The Malayan Tongue &s;ounds well, and may prove harmony to the in|genious ob&s;erver; in the&s;e parts no le&s;&s;e mu&s;icall &amp; epedemic, than is (with us, and others) the Latine, Arabique, and Sclavonian.</P>

<P>IAPAN, unle&s;&s;e <HI>Mercators</HI> fancie be true that it was <HI>Aurea Cher&s;one&s;us,</HI> was que&s;tionle&s;&s;e unknowne to old Geographers: howbeit, the Name <HI>Chry&s;e</HI> is given it by <HI>Niger; Zipangri,</HI> by <HI>M.

Whether it bee an Ile or no, is di&s;putable: &s;uch as make it one, give it in length 600, in bredth, 190 miles Engli&s;h: for my part, I hold it que&s;tionable. The mo&s;t Southerly part is removed from the line 32 deg. the be&s;t Townes and Ports of &s;trength and trade are <HI>Meacco, Ozacca, Tenze, Fyrando, Fuccate</HI> (or <HI>Falcate</HI>) <HI>Sacay, Cratez, Tenkeday, Oringaw, Vo|&s;uquis, Machma, &amp;c.</HI> Of the&s;e, <HI>Meacco</HI> (a mediterran City) is call'd the Me|troplis, <HI>Surunga</HI> next, and next it <HI>Ozacca,</HI> honoured with the Court &s;om|times till of late <HI>viz.</HI> 1615. a rebellious fire &s;ubverted and incinerated not it only, but many other Townes in that wealthy Province. <HI>Meacco</HI> is as big as <HI>Florence,</HI> but not &s;o beautifull: proud in a &s;weet and &s;patious river, in many low, but comly hou&s;es; and memorable in abundance of &s;tately Temples or Fotiquees full of guilded Mannad'as or Idolls; to which (above all other Nations) the Japonians are mo&s;t addicted; the Je&s;uits

indu&s;tries &amp; &s;eminaries there producing &s;mall growth; in&s;tead of a happy harve&s;t reaping &s;corne and catholique apo&s;ta&s;re: Neither their grave a&s;|pect, nor &s;ubtte &s;ophi&s;try; neither their many miracles there, nor their collegiat bravery, having that force to make them thought other than fe|ditious, vain-glorious, and avaricious: &s;uch is the reward of Hipocri&s;ie; in &s;hew &s;eeming de&s;irous to do others good, in truth ayming at their uni|ver&s;ality, gaine, and hope of Conque&s;t.</P>
<P>The government is Monarchicall: above three&s;core petty Kings do ho|mage, and pro&s;trate their ma&s;&s;y Coronets to be encircled, and to illu&s;trate the Emperiall Diadem; from who&s;e frowne, a puni&s;hment and affliction wor&s;e than common death u&s;ually is darted: &s;uch is his power, his awe; &s;uch their va&s;&s;alage, their opinion of their Governors. The Country is mo&s;t part mountanous; but full of floods, trees, corne, gra&s;&s;e, and mine|ralls: every way pre&s;ents Villages, &s;warming with heithen Inhabitants: the North and Ea&s;t parts of <HI>Iapan</HI> are le&s;&s;e peopled than the South and We&s;t; and tho&s;e much more &s;avage and barbarous; cruell, trecherous, idle, la&s;civious, and awed by no Law, nor any way indu&s;trious. The old Roman way of execution is here u&s;ually &s;uffered; they fa&s;ten malefactors to Cro&s;&s;es with foure nailes; whether in hate to the Je&s;uits, or of Antique cu&s;tome I am not certaine; but &s;ure it is, the puni&s;hment is full of torture and ignominious: the Civill Japonians are vallant, curteous, complemen|tall, and great affectors of novelties; but beyond mea&s;ure jealous, crafty, and revengefull, if injured; yea diveli&s;h, if exa&s;perated. They would, but cannot deny them&s;elves di&s;cended out of <HI>China,</HI> bani&s;ht upon a heedle&s;&s;e rebellion &s;ix hundred yeeres ago; in memory of which, they hate one another mortally, no quarter being given to either Nation at any time, nor cea&s;e the Ilanders to rob and piratize the Chyne&s;es at all advantages; at home al&s;o in their prayers abhominating them, and in all complements and ceremonies varying from one another to expatiate their wrath and unnaturall di&s;tempers. In any &s;light &s;u&s;pect or accu&s;ation, the very chil|dren are &s;o jealous of their reputations, that in ca&s;e you lo&s;e a trifle and &s;ay to one of them; &s;yrrah I beleeve you have &s;tolen it? without any pau&s;e the boy will immediatly cut off a joynt from one finger or ano|ther; and &s;ay Sir, if you &s;ay true, I wi&s;h my finger may never heale againe: murder, theft, trea&s;on, and adultery, are puni&s;ht with death; either cru|cified, or beheadded with a Cuttan; an Indian &s;word which &s;lices ea&s;ily.</P>
<P>Towns of note and &s;trength are <HI>Ozacca</HI> (80 leagues from <HI>Bungo</HI>) a Port Towne of good note, and neare the Sea; &s;trong and beautifull: in no|thing more famous nor ob&s;ervable than in the royall Ca&s;tle, varni&s;hed, ty|led, and burni&s;ht over with flaming gold; rich and maje&s;ticall: form'd of the be&s;t &s;hape, of excellent &s;tone; the walls, every where twenty foot thick, finely fram'd, well poli&s;ht, curiou&s;ly cemented, plea&s;ant, and du|rable: circled with deep trenches full of water; and for entrance and de|fence &s;hewes above a dozen iron Gatest, and drawing Bridges.</P>
<P>It has formerly &s;uccoured many Kings, and &s;ecur'd them from the pur|&s;uit and heat of Rebels; in this as memorable, 'twas of late yeeres made the pri&s;on of <HI>Goja-zamma</HI> Prince of <HI>Tanzey</HI> and elde&s;t Sonne of <HI>Tiquazamma</HI> the late victorious Emperour; who&s;e Father <HI>Faxiba-zamma</HI> &s;ubjected all

Again&s;t <HI>Ozacca,</HI> on the other &s;ide the river is &s;eated <HI>Sucay</HI> a Towne well traded to by Chri&s;tians: <HI>Edoo</HI> is well wall'd and peopled: 15 leagues thence is <HI>Oringoo</HI> a Towne af|fording good refre&s;hment and excellent harbouring or anchorage. <HI>Fy|rando</HI> (300 leagues thence, to coa&s;t thither,) is a Cher&s;one&s;&s;e and elevates the Artick Pole 33 degrees, 30 minutes: var. Ea&s;t 2 degrees 50 minutes: where and at <HI>Fuccate</HI> the Engli&s;h had a re&s;idence or factory.</P>
<P><HI>Fucate</HI> or <HI>Fulcate</HI> is pretty &s;weet Towne, well watered, and ownes a &s;trong and defen&s;ive Ca&s;tle or Fortre&s;&s;e: a Forre&s;t of loftie Pines and &s;preading Sycomores for three miles &s;pace environs it; with other Groves of force again&s;t the &s;corching Sun; delightfull to the eye, yea more grate|full than any other object: but (which renders them ingrate and ba&s;ely idolatrous) under tho&s;e greene trees, and in many &s;mall but richly tyl'd Temples or Fotiques, they adore <HI>Pan</HI> and <HI>Priapus,</HI> yea Satan him&s;elfe in his uglie&s;t re&s;emblances: for where the Country is mo&s;t inhabited and garni&s;ht with mo&s;t variety of trees, gra&s;&s;e, corne, &amp;c. (as, 'twixt <HI>Edoo</HI> and <HI>Suringa</HI>) there are erected mo&s;t Fotiques, there the people are mo&s;t idolatrous.</P>
<P>In <HI>Meacco</HI> are 70 Temples, wherein they number 3333 Chamaetirae or little guilded Devils, to which they give divine re&s;pect: they call them <HI>Mannadaes:</HI> But more notable than the re&s;t is that in <HI>Meacco;</HI> not unlike the Rhodyan Colo&s;&s;us, huge &amp; wonderfull. This was built by <HI>Tyco-zamma,</HI> and without much paine and co&s;t was not fini&s;hed: 'tis of Oricalke or guilded Copper; its po&s;ture is fitting in a Chaire 70 foot high, and 80 broad: his head is capable to &s;upport fifteene men, who may &s;tand toge|ther without prea&s;ing: his thumb is forty inches about; and his other limbs proportionable. This is the grand <HI>Pagotha:</HI> the other are <HI>Dii mi|nores,</HI> or of le&s;&s;e adoration. No le&s;&s;e notable is the Monument adjoyning, in a Cloi&s;ter within the principall Fotique of <HI>Meacco,</HI> where are gallantly interred (but to their ignominie) the eares &amp; no&s;es of 3000 Coreans, a ba&s;e, theevi&s;h people, vicinating &amp; infe&s;ting the Japonians. At <HI>Dabys</HI> is another Mannada no le&s;&s;e infamous and re&s;orted to: this Devill (or Molech) is of concave copper, va&s;t, thick, and double guilded: its height is foure and twenty foot, and would be more but that they have form'd it kneeling, his buttocks re&s;ting upon his leggs after the u&s;uall mode of the Ea&s;terne Pa|gans: his armes are safe &s;tretcht to the utmo&s;t; and at &s;olemne times is inflam'd within, and &s;acrific'd unto by offering him a child, which in's embraces is fride to death in an infernall torture. But of more note is another at <HI>Ten|chedy</HI> Ea&s;t thence, where Sathan vi&s;ibly playes th'Impo&s;tor. The Fo|tique is of rare &s;tructure, and daily &s;erved by a multitude of helli&s;h Prie&s;ts or Bonzees; not admitted to attend there, except they be young, well &s;hap't, and as &s;trong in venerie as was <HI>Hercules,</HI> Every new Moon they &s;o|lemnly betroth unto the Devill a Damo&s;ell, who&s;e Parents account the ceremonie happie and honourable: if any be more faire or &s;ingular than

<HEAD>Of China.</HEAD>
<P>CHINA, is the mo&s;t Ea&s;terly part of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> A Kingdome, both great and wealthie: famous al&s;o, but &s;carce di&s;covered. Their jealou&s;ie and di&s;courte&s;ie to &s;trangers (they &s;uffer any to enter, none to returne,) chiefly cau&s;es it.</P>
<P>It is &s;ubject to many &s;everall names: &s;carce any two &s;trange people ac|cord in one Nomenclation: and no wonder, &s;ince among&s;t them&s;elves they affect variety: the Kings new naming the whole Kingdome at their Coronation, as they fancie it.</P>
<P><HI>Ptolomy</HI> long agoe call'd it <HI>Sinarum Regio:</HI> other Geographers, <HI>Seres:</HI> the Moores in <HI>Indu&s;tant,</HI> call it <HI>Cathayo:</HI> the Arabians, <HI>T'&s;ynin:</HI> the Sya|mites, <HI>Cyn:</HI> the Malayans, <HI>Tabenzo:</HI> the Japonites, <HI>Thau,</HI> and <HI>T'&s;yn:</HI> the Tattarrs, <HI>Ham: Alhacen, Tangis: Paulus Venetus, Mangi:</HI> the Inhabitants (if <HI>Perera, Riccius,</HI> and <HI>Trigautius</HI> &s;ay true) <HI>Tamen;</HI> and them&s;elves <HI>Tame|gines.</HI> But how various &s;oe're that be; this is not uncertaine: that it is a very &s;patious Monarchie: for it extends from 17 deg. to 43, of North La|titude: and to the South, <HI>Cantam;</HI> to the North, <HI>Pequin;</HI> two royall Ci|ties, &s;eeme to terminate it. But thus confined: On the Ea&s;t, it has the Sea of <HI>Iapan</HI> (<HI>Corea</HI> is part of <HI>China,</HI> no Ile, but to the North conjoyned with the Continent:) On the We&s;t, the De&s;arts of <HI>Indu&s;tant;</HI> On the North, the Tattars: On the South, the <HI>Phillipinae</HI> Iles; and the South We&s;t ad|joyneth to <HI>Cochyn-China,</HI> and <HI>Pegu,</HI> with part of <HI>Siam.</HI> All agree that it is &s;quare; and that from any one &s;ide to another is 1500 Engli&s;h miles: the circuit above 4000. the Country is generally champaign, &amp; fruitfull; full of &s;weet and navigable rivers; and which are no le&s;&s;e inhabited than the Villages and Cities be: of which, <HI>China</HI> has no fewer than 600 Cities; 2000 wall'd Townes; 4000 unwalled; 1000 Ca&s;tles; and of Villages &s;carce to be numbred: and many they had need to be, &s;ince they give

lodging to above three&s;core millions of men and boyes, be&s;ides women; which be not inrolled. The whole Empire is divided into fifteene great Provinces: governed by &s;o many Quon-fu and Lau&s;ia; who have their Tutans, and Chyans, or Deputies under them. Each of tho&s;e Provinces has a Metropolis: full of people; fairely built; and very &s;patious. But every way more excellent than the re&s;t, are the&s;e foure, <HI>Paquin</HI> by &s;ome called <HI>Pa&s;quin: Nanquin</HI> or <HI>Nanton: Cantam</HI> or <HI>Canton:</HI> and <HI>Quin&s;ay,</HI> by them called <HI>Ham-ceu:</HI> of which foure, at this day <HI>Paquin</HI> is chiefe or Em|periall.</P>
<P>PAQVIN elevates the North Pole 41 degr. 15 minutes; and by late Geographers is accounted that &s;ame Citie which &s;ome call <HI>Cambalu</HI> water|ed by <HI>Poli&s;anga;</HI> and <HI>China</HI> then mu&s;t bee <HI>Cathaya:</HI> yea (if <HI>Pantoja,</HI> and <HI>Di Canti</HI> &s;ay true) the <HI>Chyna</HI> Monarch is that &s;ame great <HI>Cam,</HI> which <HI>M. P. Ve|netus</HI> and <HI>Mandevile</HI> afore him have famou&s;ed. The Citie <HI>Pequin</HI> is que|&s;tionle&s;&s;e the mo&s;t &s;patious, and be&s;t peopled in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> if not in the world: &s;ince it has 30 Duch leagues (ninety Engli&s;h miles) circumference: it includes many &s;tately buildings; and Mau&s;oleas; 24000 are numbered of the Mandarins Sepulchers; the meane&s;t of which, is not without beauty: and a no le&s;&s;e number of little guilded Chappells, be&s;ide 3800 Temples devoted to Idolatry. It has as many Gates &amp; Po&s;terns as be dayes in a yeer: &s;ix&s;core Buzzars or Market-places: above a thou&s;and Bridges of &s;tone: and &s;uch water as is every where potable. This City is not above a hundred miles from that marvellous wall, which <HI>Cri&s;nagol</HI> their King (<HI>Zaintzon</HI> the 117 King &s;ome &s;ay) built 1000 yeeres ago, to keep out the invading Tartarr: a wall 1200 miles long; &s;ix fathoms high; twelve yards thick; and &s;uch as was &s;even and twenty yeeres erecting, by a continued labour of 750000 men.</P>
<P>NANQVIN (the &s;econd Citie for grandeur and bravery, till of late,) was the <HI>China</HI> Metropolis. It elevates the Artick Pole 32 degr. and is di|&s;tant from the Sea 8 leagues or there abouts. The City is 12 leagues a|bout; circled with three &s;trong walls and ditches: the Kings Pallace is glorious and va&s;t; the other buildings many (for 200000 are reckned) but meanly beautifull: the Temples are above a thou&s;and: the &s;treets fayre; the people indu&s;trious: from <HI>Paquin</HI> removed Ea&s;t, &s;ix hundred miles Engli&s;h: mo&s;t part of the way is navigable.</P>
<P>CANTAM is at the South end of <HI>China,</HI> in 17 deg. a Towne both rich and &s;patious: our Ships came almo&s;t in view of it: from it to <HI>Paquin</HI> is two months travell.</P>
<P>QVINZAY or <HI>Ham-ceu</HI> borders <HI>Cochin-China:</HI> of old, the greate&s;t, at this day the mo&s;t admirable for variety of antick rarities in the Orient.</P>
<P>The&s;e bee the mo&s;t noted, but many other great and populous Cities this great Empire conteineth: generally of one &s;hape and alike governed: None be without their Meani or Temples fild with Dea&s;tri or Idols. The Countrey is generally champaign and fruitfull; the husbandmans care and paines make it to fructifie and repay its thanks in various tribute: each Pro|vince there is well watered: and few of tho&s;e rivers but abound in fi&s;h, which the Chyne&s;es not only banquet on, but on Frogs, Snakes, Rats, Dogs, Hogs, and &s;uch food as many other Nations abhominate: they fi&s;h with Cormorants.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="174">The people are Olive coloured; more black or white as they vary from the Aequinoctiall: they weare their haire very long, and fillited; their eyes are commonly black; their no&s;es little; their eyes &s;mall; their beards deformedly thin; and nailes often times as long as their fingers, &s;erving as a mark to di&s;tingui&s;h the Gentry by. The better &s;ort are habited in &s;ilke and a &s;leight &s;ort of &s;atten; the meaner, in black cloth made of cotton: their coats or ve&s;ts are long and quilted; made to tye under the left arme after the u&s;uall garb of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> their &s;leeves are al&s;o very long, and at the wri&s;t very &s;trait: their &s;hoes are many times of &s;uch &s;tuffe as bee their coats; and &s;oaled with cloth or callicoes: &s;ome have them richly imbroy|dered. The greate&s;t variety among&s;t them is in their head attire: &s;ome knit their hayre in cawles of &s;ilk, of hor&s;e-hayre &s;ome, and &s;ome with fillets of gold or &s;ilver: others weare high caps or felts made of fine twigs, round, and commixt with &s;ilk of divers colours; and other-&s;ome an antick &s;ort of hat, high crown'd, round, one halfe without brim, and tawny coloured. The women are commonly mode&s;t, and differ not in ap|parell; in that a like vaile of white linnen wholly couers them; &s;hewing nothing but their polt-feet, which from their infancy are &s;traitned; &s;o as to make them alla mode, many of them are maymed.</P>
<P>They tollerate Polligamy, and Sodomy; yea, what el&s;e their lu&s;tfull idle natures can dictate to plea&s;e their effeminacies. They are generally crafty, proud, la&s;ie, jealous, complementall, and voluptuous. Mu&s;ick, Po|etry, Painting, and Stage-plaies delight them exceedingly: they care not what they &s;pend in luxury and fire-works: they eat in porcellane; and have their dyet in many but &s;mall di&s;hes; their meat minc't, and which they take up with two &s;ticks of bone or Jvory; but &s;ome have their nailes &s;o long as may excu&s;e them; for to touch their mouths or meat with fingers is held ab&s;urd and impious: their drinck is commonly hot, and by its ta&s;t and colour &s;eemes to be &s;uch a Coho potion as they drinck in <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> they drinck oft and little. The Louthya's are &s;erved on the knee, and much re|garded; they all &s;it upon &s;tooles and eat on Tables. And albeit no Nation in the world is more idle and gluttenous; yet are no beggars to be found there; if he be young and beg, the whip rewards him; if old or lame, or blind, the Ho&s;pitall releeves him. Murder they puni&s;h with death; theft and adultery commonly with the &s;trappado: their Ju&s;tice is &s;evere and impartiall; their pri&s;ons, &s;trong; their executions, beheading; or &s;tar|ving them. The Mandarins are honoured; the Chyam's reverenced; the King adored: no Subject nor Amba&s;&s;ador ever &s;ees or &s;peaks with him, (&s;ave his children and Eunuchs) except by petition. They &s;uffer Amba&s;&s;a|dors (or others) to enter <HI>China</HI> &s;o they bring pre&s;ents of valew; otherwi&s;e they &s;u&s;pect them as &s;pies and no way honour them. The Chynaes are curious in novelties: and love to &s;ee &s;trange Arts; which they al&s;o delight|fully practi&s;e: few of them but has skill in &s;ome thing; either in tillage, making <HI>China</HI> di&s;hes or porcellane, to paint, &s;ing, or play well: the Mathe|maticks they affect, &amp; the civill Laws: they u&s;e not letters but Characters, or Hyerogliphicks, of which they have above 40000: they write neither to the right hand nor to the left, as the Latin and Hebrews did; but right downe and &s;immetrically: they write with pencills made of hor&s;e hayre,
<PB N="339" REF="174">
&s;uch as they al&s;o paint with: their language is mo&s;t part of mono&s;yllables: they be generally Poets and Mu&s;icians: affected with Rhetorick and Di|vination. The Schollers and Merchants in this republique are much more honoured than the Souldiers bee: and &s;ome rea&s;on they have for it, They are &s;o cowardly, la&s;ie, and tyrannicall. No people in the world more ho|nour their King than do the Chynaes: they &s;uppo&s;e him too glorious for them to look upon; they obey his will in every thing; they fill his Ex|chequor yeerely with above a hundred millions of crownes; they call him The undaunted Emperour, and great Lord of the whole World; Son of the Sun; and beauty of the whole Earth.</P>
<P>No people what&s;oever, expre&s;&s;e more filiall re&s;pect unto their Parents than the Chyne&s;es do: they obey them at all times, and every where: they do nothing to di&s;plea&s;e them: they marry not without their a&s;&s;ent: their childrens Names are at their di&s;po&s;ing: they honour them, bee they never &s;o meane; releeve them, bee they never &s;o poore; at their death, expre&s;&s;e all &s;ymptoms po&s;&s;ible of their loyalty and duty: and &s;el|dome mourne le&s;&s;e (in white linnen, as did the Jewes) than two or three yeeres; the longer they mourne, they think they the better expre&s;&s;e af|fection.</P>
<P>They arrogate all &s;orts of excellencies whether in Art or Science, as peculiar to their Nation: they think their Speech the mo&s;t &s;weet and rhe|toricall of any in the world: what other people have, they judge deduct|ed and borrowed from their tran&s;cendent Notions. They &s;ay they are the mo&s;t ancient and immixt people in the Univer&s;e; and borrow nothing of any other Nation. They &s;ay they fir&s;t invented Letters (or Characters,) Guns, Painting, Tillage, and Navigation: yet in none of the&s;e (for all their brags) can they parallell us of <HI>Europe.</HI> For their antiquity, I deny not but they may have continued their plantation and without much mixture (admirable if &s;o, for the Tartarrs and Siamits have oft over-runne them) &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;eminary, begunne by <HI>Sem</HI> in tho&s;e parts: yet may others in that point compare with them; I might nominate the Bryttains: for I re|gard not their Lies and Hi&s;tories of &s;uch Kings as reigned, or &s;uch Con|que&s;ts as the Chyne&s;es obteined (long before the birth of Time) a hun|dred thou&s;and yeeres ago; unle&s;&s;e wee qualifie it by the example of the Arcadians, who&s;e yeare had but ninety dayes; of the Ma&s;&s;agers, who had fifteen yeeres, or of the Aegyptians who had twelve yeeres in one of ours; following the cour&s;e of the Moone, and not the revolution of the Sunne, nor regarding the <HI>Dies intercalares:</HI> an error, mo&s;t of the Orientall Eth|niques are plunged in. Their letters are not &s;o &s;uccinct as ours: their Hieroglyphicks come &s;hort of the Aegyptians. Their Guns are not &s;o &s;erviceable: they have them not above a &s;pan long; &s;o that they rather re&s;emble Pi&s;tols than Guns: nor are their bore nor &s;quaring &s;o good as ours; &s;o &s;trong, &s;o near, &s;o mathematicall. Their painting is of good co|lours; but their de&s;igning farre &s;hort of our invention: they draw the po&s;tures filthily, and &s;hadow meanly; which doubtle&s;&s;e in painting makes the perfection. Their husbandry is without Art or Rea&s;on: the graine is good, the &s;oyle rich, the Zone moderate; and yet their corne is neither &s;o various, &s;o good, nor &s;o certaine, as be our Harve&s;ts. Their Na|vigation
<PB N="340" REF="175">
is lame: they build many &s;hips; but without beauty, or &s;ervice: nor have they much skill in &s;ayling, their Logarithms and Mathematick in&s;truments to take the height of the Sun by failing them: their Compa&s;&s;e al&s;o is defective; for they have but eight or twelve points at mo&s;t to di|&s;tingui&s;h by: nor is the Magnet (till of late) acquainted with them: for all which, they &s;ay they &s;ee with two eyes; we with one; and that all o|ther people be more than purblind in &s;otti&s;h ignorance.</P>
<P>They delight exce&s;&s;ively in all &s;orts of games, and voluptuou&s;ne&s;&s;e: they can play at che&s;&s;e, iri&s;h, pa&s;&s;age, in and in, hazard; and not only play great games, but when they have lo&s;t, care not though they &s;take their wives and children; whom if they lo&s;e, they part with till they can ad|vance &s;o much money as they were &s;taked for. They are very ho&s;pitable one to another, and have &s;o &s;ure a faith of the Re&s;urrection that they &s;ome|times lend money to be repayed them in the world to come. Inter-Iudes, Ma&s;qs, Fire-workes, and &s;uch devices wonderfully take them: nor valew they what money they expend in &s;uch &s;port, &s;o their expectation bee not deluded. Their hou&s;es are meanly built, and as badly furni&s;hed. Their Meani or Temples have no &s;uch grandeur, nor beauty, as in a Countrey &s;o peacefull, &s;o rich, and among&s;t a people &s;o &s;tudious, &s;o &s;uper&s;titious, might be chalenged: but though their out&s;ides bee but ordinary, yet bee they many times lined with excellent good Marble, Prophyre and Ser|pentine.</P>
<P>They celebrate their Natalitia or Birth-daies with great &s;olemnity: for fifteene dayes they rejoyce and play; and each night gormundi&s;e up|on choice fruits, wines, and cates, with no &s;mall voracity. The New yeere, which they begin in March, is no le&s;&s;e illu&s;trated: at that time every man reares up his Pageant, and beautifies his door with paper Arches, and Ima|ges, and all the night long makes them vi&s;ible by &s;tore of Lantherns.</P>
<P>Their Weddings have equal Ceremony: greater or le&s;&s;er after the qua|lity of the Decea&s;ed. When any Chyna dies, they wa&s;h him every where, perfume him next, and then apparrell him: they put his be&s;t cloaths on, and hate to let his head be naked: that done, they &s;eat him in his chayre, and make him &s;it as if hee were not dead but living. At a &s;et time his wife enters the roome; &s;he fir&s;t does him re&s;pect, ki&s;&s;es him, and takes her farewell by expre&s;&s;ing &s;o much love and &s;orrow as is po&s;&s;ible: at her departure &s;he takes her lodging, and her children next enter; where they kneele and ki&s;&s;e his hands, yea &s;ympathi&s;e, and &s;trive to out-vie each o|ther in their ejaculations, and &s;uch outward notions of &s;orrow and piety as is imaginable; beating their brea&s;ts, and powring out teares in abun|dance: next to them his kindred do their parts, and then his friends and other acquaintance: the third day they coffin him, in mo&s;t pretious wood; cover it with a co&s;tly cloth, and over it place his Image: for fifteen dayes the corps re&s;t &s;o; each day having a Table &s;pread with dainty meats, but nightly the Prie&s;ts eat it and burne Incen&s;e, &amp; offer an expiatory Sacrifice: when they carry it to the grave (which is neither within any Town nor Citie) they have women that do accompany it, purpo&s;ely hyred to howle, to teare their hayre, and to move others to compa&s;&s;ion: &s;ometimes upon his coffin they place divers pictures of dead men, whom they intreat to
<PB N="341" REF="175" MS="y">
&s;hew him the be&s;t way to Paradi&s;e: that done, his wife and children for &s;ome dayes &s;eclude them&s;elves from &s;ight of men: and when they go a|broad, go dolorou&s;ly habited: they put cour&s;e &s;ack-cloth next their skin; have their cloaths made long and plain; and for three yeeres &s;carce laugh, or &s;eeme to joy in any thing: but contrariwi&s;e indeavour to the utmo&s;t of their power to agrandi&s;e their Duty by a continued lamentation, ab&s;ti|nence from publique fea&s;ts, and pa&s;times: yea in all their letters, in&s;tead of their Names &s;ub&s;cribe them&s;elves Such a ones di&s;obedient and unworthy Child, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But for all this, the Devill has too great a &s;overaignty over them: mo&s;t of their Colledges and Temples expre&s;&s;ing by one or other invention, their infernall wi&s;dome, and familiarity with that old Magician; to whom they devote many enthu&s;ia&s;tick boyes, who with their long &s;pread haire, pro&s;trate them&s;elves afore the Mannada or Idoll; and &s;uddenly as if &s;ome Hag had terrified them, &s;tart up and vibrate their &s;words, kept there of purpo&s;e: whiles the Idolaters with dejected lookes note their antick po|&s;tures, and cea&s;e not to warble out a &s;oft Doriq' &s;ort of mu&s;ick, not de|parting till the vaticinating youths pronounce &s;omewhat, poynting at his Wor&s;hip and their Obedience.</P>

<P><HI>Mauritius</HI> is an Ile abounding with all good things requi&s;ite for mans u&s;e, and require-able for the Zone 'tis placed in: the land (e&s;pecially where it re&s;pects the Sea) is high and mountainous: the &s;hape &s;omewhat round; the circuit not much above a hundred Engli&s;h miles: the greate&s;t extent is from the North Ea&s;t to South-We&s;t: every where &s;weet &amp; flouri&s;hing.

I could hardly beget pa&s;&s;ages. The Palmeto is a remarkable Tree and mo&s;t beneficiall to Travellers: 'tis like the Coco or Date in growth, &s;ave that her boughes are large and rounder: the Palmeto is long, and &s;traight, and round, and &s;oft; without leafe, bough, or branch, &s;ave at the very top; and tho&s;e are few, and greene, and &s;edgie: under the branch appeare certaine codded &s;eeds: both trees (male and female) blo&s;&s;ome, but the &s;hee is only fruitfull; and not &s;o neither, unle&s;&s;e a flowring branch of the male tree be yearely innoculated or incorporated, that by a commixture of &s;eed the fe|male may fructifie; no miracle in Nature: the leaves &s;erve for many u&s;es; wee made them cover our Tents, to &s;hade us from the Sun and the &s;ere|nes which fall nightly, and are dangerous: at the top of the Palmeto tree is a &s;oft pith, in which con&s;i&s;ts the &s;oule or vergetative vertue, for being cut out the tree dyes; the pith is in bigne&s;&s;e like a &s;mall Cabbage, in ta&s;te like a Nut, but boyld eats like a Colli-flory. Of more value is the Palmeto wine; it is mu&s;t or &s;weet, plea&s;ant and nouri&s;hing; in colour and ta&s;te not unlike new Muskadine. It is intoxicating, but cold in the dige&s;tion; it pur|ges and helps ob&s;tructions, kills wormes, and let &s;tand two dayes in the Sun, becomes good vinegar. The wine is thus gathered: we peirce or cut &s;mall holes in three or foure trees that grow together; the &s;ap or liquor effudes pre&s;ently, and all the holes or ve&s;&s;ells are quickly filled: impatience for|bids to bring wooden barrycoes thither, our bellies were prepared to re|ceive it; by help of a Cane or Quill we &s;uck and &s;uck againe, from one tree to another, two or three trees in le&s;&s;e than an houre repletiating the gree|die&s;t appetites, though they bowze their bellies full.</P>

Nor for another very frequent there, but by its likene&s;&s;e the &s;ame which the barbarous Africans at <HI>Sierra-leon</HI> call <HI>O'gou,</HI> with which they invenome their Darts and Shafts: the Tree is not high nor bungie; the branches &s;pread to a great length, and beare many Cods (not unlike the Indian Beanes) arm'd with many &s;harp prickles: by &s;uch a defence one would think the fruit or kernell valuable, but it decei|ved us; the fruit (or kernell hid within tho&s;e Cods) is round, &s;carce &s;o big as a Doves egge; the &s;hell, and colour very like a Bezar &s;tone; hard to crack, but crackt it may be; within, it has a Nut, ta&s;ted like an Acorne, the quality (if not the &s;ame) little better than poy&s;on.

This I tooke notice of, that what the Birds eat not, the Tortoy&s;es doe eat; and what the Tortoy&s;es refu&s;e to eat, the Hoggs devoure: &s;o, as by one or other, all is ta&s;ted of. Againe, as this noble Ile is prodigall in her water and wood, &s;o &s;hee corre&s;ponds in what el&s;e a fruitfull Parent labours in: not only boa&s;ting in that variety, but in feathered creatures al&s;o; yea, in the rarene&s;&s;e of that variety: I will but name &s;ome of them; you &s;hall lick them to perfection. The Dodo comes fir&s;t to our de&s;cription: here, and in <HI>Dygarrois</HI> (and no where el&s;e, that ever I could &s;ee or heare of) is gene|rated the Dodo (a Portuguize name it is, and has reference to her &s;imple|nes,) a Bird which for &s;hape and rarene&s;&s;e might be call'd a Phoenix (wer't in <HI>Arabia:</HI>) her body is round and extreame fat, her &s;low pace begets that corpulencie; few of them weigh le&s;&s;e than fifty pound: better to the eye than &s;tomack: grea&s;ie appetites may perhaps commend them, but to the indifferently curious, nouri&s;hment, but prove offen&s;ive. Let's take her picture: her vi&s;age darts forth melancholy, as &s;en&s;ible of Natures injurie in framing &s;o great and ma&s;&s;ie a body to be directed by &s;uch &s;mall and com|plementall wings, as are unable to hoi&s;e her from the ground, &s;erving only to prove her a Bird; which otherwi&s;e might be doubted of: her head is va|riou&s;ly dre&s;t, the one halfe hooded with downy blacki&s;h feathers; the other, perfectly naked; of a whiti&s;h hue, as if a tran&s;parent Lawne had co|vered it: her bill is very howked and bends downwards, the thrill or breathing place is in the mid&s;t of it; from which part to the end, the co|lour is a light greene mixt with a pale yellow; her eyes be round and &s;mall, and bright as Diamonds; her cloathing is of fine&s;t Downe, &s;uch as you &s;ee in Go&s;lins: her trayne is (like a <HI>China</HI> beard) of three or foure &s;hort feathers; her legs thick, and black, and &s;trong; her tallons or pounces &s;harp, her &s;tomack fiery hot, &s;o as &s;tones and iron are ea&s;ily dige&s;ted in it; in that and &s;hape, not a little re&s;embling the <HI>Africk</HI> Oe&s;triches: but &s;o much, as for their more certain difference I dare to give thee (with two others) her repre&s;entation.</P>

A word now of the Soyle it &s;elfe.</P>
<P>The Ile has many good places to anchor in: two are well knowne; the one, at the North-We&s;t &s;ide, which beares the forme of a Hemi-cicle, and elevates the Pole Antartique, 19 degrees, and 30 minutes: the other, at the South-Ea&s;t is directly oppo&s;ite, and in 20 degrees, 15 minutes; in lon|gitude from Cape <HI>Comryn</HI> the utmo&s;t promontory of <HI>India,</HI> 20 degrees, 20 minutes: and from the Lizard the extreame&s;t part of England, 99. both Bayes &s;eeme land-lockt, the ground is oazy, the depth in 5, 10, 15, or 20 fadoms, as the Sea-man be&s;t affects: No where dangerous. The Soile it &s;elfe; is &s;tony and trouble&s;ome towards the &s;hoare; howbeit the in|land parts are fat, and plea&s;ant, full of &s;hadowing trees, and drilling rivo|lets, reciprocally benevolent, equally delightfull to the eye and ta&s;te: &s;ome few places excepted; which either &s;torming at the a&s;piring height of &s;ome adjacent Mountaines, or efflated in their owne noi&s;e, de&s;cend &s;o violently that they become Cataracts in their violent and precipitious

Amber-grea&s;e is often found flooting about this Iland: how generated, whether in the Whale, or froth of Seas, or other wi&s;e, is yet doubted of. Corall, white and plea&s;ant to look upon, grows here in abunda-ce: but how that &s;tincking weed Tobacco came thither I know not: whether by Art or Nature que|&s;tionable. To conclude, this plea&s;ante&s;t of A&s;iatick Iles is un-inhabited, unle&s;&s;e you plea&s;e to intitle Bea&s;ts and Birds Inhabitants: tho&s;e live here without dread of Lyon, Tygre, Wolfe, Fox, Dog, or &s;uch offen&s;ive crea|tures; and have it upon this condition, to pay a gracefull Tith or Tribute to &s;uch &s;hips as famine or foule weather direct to ride here: a fit place for Sir <HI>Thomas Moore</HI> to have &s;eated his Utopia in.

But home we mu&s;t; the wind blew faire, the Sea was calme and all our company fully refre&s;hed. So, aboard wee went, and in three houres &s;aile lo&s;t &s;ight of that Eli&s;ium; wi&s;hing &s;uch an Optick gla&s;&s;e as every where would &s;hew it us: but our &s;trong imaginations repre|&s;ent it.</P>
<P>The fift day we de&s;cried land; it bore South-We&s;t from us: by its height, &s;hape, and po&s;ition, wee knew 'twas that our Captaines called Englands Forre&s;t: next day we attained it. The name was <HI>Anno</HI> 1613. impo&s;ed by Captaine <HI>Ca&s;tleton</HI> Commander of the Pearle (a &s;hip I meane:) &s;ome &s;ay the errant Potugall fir&s;t &s;aw it, and by Seignior <HI>Ma&s;carenas</HI> from his owne name was denominated: yet other-&s;ome go further and call it <HI>Pulo-puar,</HI> an Indian name, but by whom or when, darkly writ in the mi&s;tique Cha|racter of Oblivion. The Ile has above fifty Engli&s;h miles circuit: the South Pole is elevated in that place, 20 degrees, and 55 minutes, South from the Aequator: in longitude from <HI>Mauritius</HI> 1 degree and a halfe: (but di&s;tant thence, &s;even and thirty Duch leagues:) and variation of the Compa&s;&s;e 23 degrees: an Ile exceeding lofty, made fying her a&s;piring fore|head within the middle Region: every where greene, and ever flori&s;h|ing; plea&s;antly apparelled in various liveries; e&s;pecially in &s;tore of trees, branching gallantly, and mounting to a rare &s;ublimity. It had no Creature in it, &s;ave birds; till our Captaine landed &s;ome Hogs and Goats of both kinds, that by a happy multiplication and encrea&s;e the future Pa&s;&s;enger might be releeved and ble&s;&s;e the Planter. It wants not water, &s;weet and plentifull: the fre&s;h &s;treams are Magazeins of watry Citizens, &s;uch as &s;port them&s;elves in that liquid Element: 'twere prolixity to name halfe of them; the Eeles are notable; many there be, and mo&s;t weigh thirty pounds; not odious in their corpulency, for to the ta&s;t they render them&s;elves &s;weet, moi&s;t, and excellent: the birds are many, rare, but mo&s;t of them &s;uch as are &s;poken of in the <HI>Mauritius.</HI></P>

<P>For many hundred miles we had nothing bat Sea and Ayre to fea&s;t our &s;ights with: &s;omwhat bettered by many &s;hoales of fi&s;h every where con|comitating us, now and then by too much greedine&s;&s;e proffering them|&s;elves to the deceitfull bait of the cunning Marriner.

<P>S^t. <HI>Helena</HI> is removed South from the Aequator &s;ixteene degrees: has longitude from the utmo&s;t promontory of South <HI>Africk,</HI> two and twenty degrees: the needle varies there, five degrees and thirteene minutes From the lands end of <HI>England</HI> is di&s;tant 1500 leagues, or 4500 Engli&s;h miles: From the Cape of <HI>Good hope</HI> 580 leagues, or 1740 miles. From <HI>Mada|ga&s;car</HI> 1000 leagues, or 3000 miles. From <HI>Surat</HI> 2200 leagues, or 6600 miles. And from <HI>Bantam</HI> in <HI>Iava</HI> 2300 leagues, or 6900 miles, or there|abouts. The Ile has this front in that Bay which takes name from the Chappell, nigh which we anchored.</P>

To what part of th'inhabited world it appertaines, is doubtfull; the va&s;t Aethiopique Ocean &s;o largely circles it. To <HI>Afer</HI> I imagine (becau&s;e its neere&s;t to that Continent,) rather than <HI>Ve&s;putius.</HI> The Ile is &s;mall; it exceeds not thirty Engli&s;h miles in circumference: exce&s;&s;ive high; it wraps its head for the mo&s;t part in the clouds, where it opens its wide mouth, and gulps down &s;ufficient moi&s;ture to coole its heat, and fatten it: and but for that affinity it has with the middle Region which invelops it with a chil-cold Tulipant, the extreame heat wanton <HI>Phaeton</HI> darts con|&s;tantly in that Zone, yea twice every yeare perpendicularly upon this Ile when hee is Zenith, would doubtle&s;&s;e incinerate, and make the entralls enflame (for it has Sulphur) like another <HI>Ve&s;uvius.</HI> The land (I told you) is very high, but not more eminent in its height, than the Sea (clo&s;e by the Ile) is admirable in the depth; &s;o deepe that it admits ill anchoring (a place, N.W. from the channell where is riding at 20 fadoms, excepted;) where|by,
<PB N="354" REF="182">
Marriners are forced to carry their anchors a &s;hoare, if they would ride &s;ecurely: and with good cau&s;e too; for, by rea&s;on of the abi&s;&s;e, I could hardly di&s;cerne any flux or reflux, as if wee had beene neere no land, but rather in the body of the Sea, where neither ebb nor flow can be di&s;co|vered: the &s;alt water indeed continually pla&s;hes and froaths with rage to &s;ee it &s;elfe to &s;uddenly re&s;i&s;ted; but, the moi&s;t breath u&s;ually vapring in or upon the Seas occa&s;ions it, and makes it turbulent.</P>
<P>The Ile is hard to be a&s;cended; not that the pa&s;&s;age is craggie, but pre|cipitious: the Sailers Proverb of it is, A man may choo&s;e whither he will break his heart going up, or his neck in comming down; a merry jea&s;t, but let them choo&s;e it. Once up, no place yeelds a more delightfull object. It is even and plaine above, &s;welling no where to a deformed ri&s;ing; cloath'd with &s;weet gra&s;&s;e, long and curious; every where it gives a large pro&s;pect and horizon into the Ocean. The Springs above are &s;weet, but below are bracki&s;h; the rea&s;on is, they participate (in their drilling di&s;cent) of the &s;alt hills, through which it cuts a pa&s;&s;age; &s;alt both by their owne compo|&s;ition, and the &s;alt breath the Sea perpetually evaporates. There are but two rivolets in that Ile: the one bubbles down into the Chappell, th'other into the Lemmon Vallyes. They take their names fro~ a Lemon tree whence it ari&s;es, and an old Chappell built at the very bottome by the Spaniard <HI>Anno</HI> 1571, and delapidated by the Dutch; a place once intended for Gods glory, but by malice of rude man made ruinous and a prophane ne&s;t of un|cleane avarice. The ruines of a little Towne demoli&s;ht lately &s;hew them|&s;elves, and &s;erve to te&s;tifie a like Fate makes men and Villages dye, Death and de&s;truction makes both mortall and mi&s;erable. Some &s;ay the Spani&s;h King &s;ubverted it, in that it became an unlawfull Magazein of Sea-mens Traffick, turning and returning out of both the Indyes: thereby lo&s;ing his tribute in too apparent mea&s;ure. It is but lately made &s;ociable: the world is but beginning there; no Monuments, no Antique rarities are there found. You &s;ee all, if you looke upon the &s;hatterd ribs of an old weather beaten Carrique, and &s;ome broken peeces of great Ordnance left there again&s;t the Owners good liking, and &s;erve now in &s;tead of Anchors. The Ile is de&s;olate of rea&s;onable Inhabitants: Hoggs and Goats dwell there: they agree well-favouredly, and multiply in mighty numbers; happy in their ea&s;e and &s;afety, till &s;hips arrive there to bani&s;h hunger: wee got al&s;o other good refre&s;hment; Phe&s;ants, Powts, Quailes, Henns, Partrich; and (which were as acceptable) divers &s;orts of gra&s;&s;e &amp; roots, Wood-&s;orrell, three-leav'd-gra&s;&s;e, Ba&s;il, Par&s;ly, Mints, Spinage, Fennel, Annys, Radi&s;h, Mu&s;tard-&s;eed, Tobacco, and &s;ome others, which by a willing hand, directed by an ingenious eye, may &s;oone be gathered: brought hither, and here &s;owne by <HI>Fernandus Lupius</HI> an hone&s;t Portugall, in the yeare of our Lord 1509. who&s;e Country-men at this day dare hardly land there to over-&s;ee their Seminary, or owne their labours; le&s;t the Engli&s;h or Hollander in the churli&s;h language of a Cannon que&s;tion them. <HI>Anno</HI> 1588 <HI>Candi&s;h</HI> our Country-man landed here in his circum-navigating the earth: I name him in this re&s;pect; he reports, he found here &s;tore of Lemmons, Orenges, Pomgranads, Pomcitrons, Figgs, Dates &amp;c. but now are none of the&s;e fruits growing there that I could &s;ee or heare of, a Lemmon tree excepted;

to conclude, here wee buried in the old Chappell our hone&s;t Captaine <HI>Andrew Evans:</HI> his deaths wound (as I have told you) was given him by a fi&s;h at the <HI>Mauritius.</HI></P>
<P>Saint <HI>Hellena</HI> was a plea&s;ant place, but bad for us to &s;tay too long in: after &s;ix dayes commorance, wee paid our reckning in a hearty Farwell, and by benefit of a happy gale cut &s;wiftly the yeelding billowes in a North|we&s;t cour&s;e; whereby, on the &s;ixteenth of October wee made our &s;elves Nadyr to the Sunne, at that time in his Progre&s;&s;e towards the Antartique Tropick: our latitude was 13 deg. and 13 min: the third day after that we got &s;ight of <HI>A&s;cention Ile,</HI> nam'd &s;o by <HI>Iohn de Nova</HI> in the yeare 1502: 'tis removed South from the Equinoctiall Circle &s;even degrees, 40 minutes: in circuit it is 30 Engli&s;h miles; from S^t. <HI>Hellens</HI> Ile removed &s;even hundred and twenty: little in it &s;ave wood and water, ob&s;ervable.</P>
<P>On the &s;even and twentieth day we cro&s;t under the Aequator; whence, to nine degrees North latitude wee were pe&s;terd with continuall Torna|thes; a variable weather, compos'd of lowd bla&s;ts, &s;tinking &s;howers, and terrible thunders. The eleventh of November we were parallel to <HI>Cape de Verd,</HI> and with the GORGADES, I&s;les famou&s;ed by antient Poets, who &s;ay, that the three Gorgons, <HI>Medu&s;a, Stenia,</HI> and <HI>Euryale,</HI> the daughters of of King <HI>Phorcys Neptunes</HI> &s;onne here lived, and by the tran&s;cendent ex|cellencie of their beauties (their yellow haires curling like Snakes, and de&s;hevelling about their naked &s;houlders) turn'd the beholders into a &s;tu|pid admiration, and by <HI>Per&s;eus</HI> his report of that their faculty gave Poets &s;ome ground whereon to build their fiction. Leaving tho&s;e, wee &s;teered We&s;tward, and pa&s;t by many parts of the New found world (as &s;ome men call it) <HI>Guiana, Florida, Virginia, Nova Anglia,</HI> (parts of <HI>Norumbega</HI>) and the gulph of <HI>Mexico:</HI> where I have &s;eated my &s;elfe a while, and will de|fraud the Reader of &s;ome patience, by travelling to find out the fir&s;t Di&s;co|verer: a Que&s;tion not a little controverted.</P>

<P>ALbeit I have formerly in a line or two vindicated the honour of our Country, lo&s;t in the greater part by protract of malitious time, and wane of well-willers to defend it; I de&s;ire to &s;peak more largely here, and give you the ground of my conjecture, That <HI>Madoc</HI> (&s;onne of <HI>Owyn Gwy|neth</HI>) di&s;covered the We&s;terne world now call'd <HI>America,</HI> three hundred and odd yeares before <HI>Columbus:</HI> not to detract from that mans worth, but that the truth may prevaile, and the memory of our Heroick Country-man revive; having ga&s;pt too long in hatefull ignorance and oblivion: for, if analogie of language and authority of good Authors may be credited, it may peradventure be accepted of, yea among&s;t Critticks gaine entertain|ment.</P>

From an innate de&s;ire to travell, and to avoid dome&s;tique broiles he put that in action which &s;ome old prophetique &s;ayings gave him light and encouraged him in. 'Tis very like he had read <HI>Plato</HI> (for what part of the world has ever more affected learning than the <HI>Britians</HI>) who in his Dialogue 'twixt <HI>Tymeus</HI> and <HI>Cricius,</HI> di&s;cour&s;es of a great va&s;t Ile, We&s;t from the Atlantique Ocean, and named ATLAS: as bigg as <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> put together. Some Humination hee had al&s;o out of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> and <HI>Theophra&s;tus</HI> their Books of Rarities writ two thou&s;and yeares agoe, re|lating how &s;ome Merchants pa&s;&s;ing thorow the Straits of <HI>Gibralter,</HI> were by tempe&s;t driven whither wind and Sea compelled them, &s;o farre We&s;t that they finally di&s;cried land, but un inhabited: It may be 'twas &s;ome of the <HI>Azores:</HI> but what ere it was, it proved a Magnet of encouragement to illure future Ages to di&s;cover We&s;tward, and doubtle&s;&s;e was a prime cau&s;e of finding out the We&s;terne Continent. <HI>Hanno</HI> al&s;o is &s;uppo&s;ed to have landed there. Que&s;tionle&s;&s;ed he adventured farre (far in regard they had no Compa&s;&s;e to returne by) into the Atlantique Seas; but which way he &s;ail'd is di&s;putable: We&s;t, &s;ome say: &s;ome say, Southward. <HI>Pomponius Mele</HI> and <HI>Lampridus</HI> affirme the land was South from <HI>Carthage</HI> hee di&s;cove|red; if South, then no part of the We&s;t-Indies: the Canary Iles perhaps, the <HI>Atlantiades,</HI> the <HI>Gorgades, Ascention,</HI> or Saint <HI>Helens;</HI> who though they carry not the Epithite of Great, yet the Novelty con&s;idered, and the Di&s;tance, the word great may be affected.

<P><HI>Madoc</HI> from the&s;e lights di&s;cerned it: And lea&s;t any may thinck the man to whon we erect a Trophy of &s;o great honour, an ob&s;cure or illite|rate man, not worth a memory; let's in a line or two &s;peak his di&s;cent and quality, and then the particulars of his vovage.</P>
<P>He was brother to Prince <HI>David,</HI> &s;onnes of that famous <HI>Owen Gwynedd</HI> Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> who for above thirty yeeres governed wi&s;ely, with great courage and good fortune: his Father was <HI>Gruffith ap Conan</HI> that did ho|mage for &s;ome lands in <HI>England,</HI> to <HI>William</HI> the Conquerour at S. <HI>Davids:</HI> and de&s;cended lineally from King <HI>Rodri</HI> Mawr (or <HI>Roderic</HI> the great) glo|rious in many, conflicts and victories again&s;t the &s;avage <HI>Saxon;</HI> in tho&s;e foure great battells e&s;pecially, at <HI>Berthem, Bangelu, Monegid,</HI> and <HI>Angle&s;ea,</HI> in the yeere from <HI>Adam</HI> 4820: from the nativity of our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour 846. &s;uch time as <HI>Burchred</HI> King of <HI>Mercia, Athelwolfe</HI> King of the We&s;t-Say&s;&s;es, <HI>Meiric</HI> and other valiant Princes by &s;ad tryall found him fortunate: which &s;uffice to illu&s;trate <HI>Madock's</HI> quality, every way exceeding honourable.</P>
<P>It followes why they put to Sea upon di&s;covery. The Annalls of tho&s;e times (to this day happily pre&s;erved) tell us, That &s;o &s;oone as <HI>Owen Gwy|nedd</HI> (or <HI>Venedotia</HI>) was dead; the cu&s;tome of Gavelkind (which has con|founded <HI>Wales</HI>) became a Subject of implacable hate among&s;t his &s;onnes, <HI>Iorwerth</HI> (or <HI>Edward,</HI> &s;irnamed <HI>Dwryndwn,</HI> from his broken no&s;e) <HI>Howel</HI> and <HI>David;</HI> who&s;e peculiar, ambition bani&s;ht all generall kinds of love due among&s;t friends and brethren. <HI>Iorwerth,</HI> albeit he was elde&s;t, was held incapable of the Crowne in re&s;pect of his lamene&s;&s;e and other deformi|ties: <HI>Howel</HI> al&s;o was thought unworthy by rea&s;on his Mother was an Iri&s;h Lady, with which Nation they had then &s;ome difference: <HI>David</HI> had lea&s;t right by law of Nature and Nations, being younge&s;t; howbeit, by his comly per&s;onage, his skill in Armes, but principally by marrying <HI>Emma Plantaginet,</HI> &s;i&s;ter to King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd, hee got the Scepter into his hands, and &s;wayed it as be&s;t liked him: yet the Crowne tottered upon his head, till in a victory again&s;t his brethren wherein <HI>Hoell</HI> was &s;laine, hee fitted it better and fa&s;tned it. But a &s;upream power and Ju&s;tice would not e&s;tabli&s;h it again&s;t right and rea&s;on, for &s;o &s;oone as <HI>Llewellyn</HI> (<HI>Iorwerths</HI> &s;onne and right heyre) was capable to gra&s;p it, hee drew many of <HI>Davids</HI> men to his party (&s;uch is the vulgars levity) promi&s;ing them great matters; and ayded by <HI>Howell ap Meredith</HI> and <HI>Conan ap Owen</HI> his active kin&s;men, <HI>David</HI> unwillingly de&s;cends from his Princely Seat, and <HI>Llewellyn</HI> is &s;eated <HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1194; not without much blood-&s;hed and di&s;traction of the wi&s;e&s;t.</P>

In ten good Barques, loaded with all nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions they advanced back, and mo&s;t fortunately re-attained the &s;ame place they hoped for. Great re|joycing was among them at that their happine&s;&s;e, but no le&s;&s;e &s;orrow fol|lowed: for, being come to the Plantation, they found few of tho&s;e they left there, living: cau&s;ed by too much eating, the indi&s;po&s;ition or Novel|ty of that ayre arid climate, (which though never &s;o excellent, yet cau&s;es &s;ickne&s;&s;e and alteration in new Inhabitants) by &s;ome trecherie of the Bar|barians. <HI>Madoc</HI> dige&s;ted it with a Chri&s;tian fortitude and patience, and forth-with bettered the Colony, by help of <HI>Eneon</HI> and <HI>Edwall</HI> his brothers Contriving every thing with &s;o good order, that they were &s;ecure from any Enemie, and had all things conducing to ea&s;e, plenty, and contented|ne&s;&s;e: they threw away the too indulgent thoughts of their Native homes, by this rea&s;on, that if they died there, they were in the &s;ame di&s;tance from heaven, and had as ea&s;ie a journey thither: what mo&s;t afflicted them was the breach of promi&s;e, many of their friends had made but not performed. The cau&s;e was not in them, but in the overture of that &s;tate turn'd top&s;ie|turvie by the <HI>Brittaine</HI> Princes, and totally by the indi&s;cretion of that un|happy Prince <HI>Lluellyn ap Gryffith,</HI> (lately married to <HI>Eleoner,</HI> daughter of <HI>Monteford</HI> the bold Earle of <HI>Lece&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Eleoner</HI> daughter of King <HI>Iohn</HI>) which <HI>Gruffyth</HI> was &s;laine <HI>Anno</HI> 1282 at <HI>Buelht</HI> by <HI>Franckton</HI> an Engli&s;h|man in an unmanly fa&s;hion. So that <HI>Madoc</HI> and his Company returned no more, nor did the Wel&s;h &s;aile thither afterward, whereby one of another in &s;mall time were in &s;ome &s;ort forgotten and never remembred.</P>
<P>But although <HI>Madoc</HI> and his Cambrian crew are dead and their memo|ry moath-eaten; yet the foot-&s;teeps and reliques of their former living there are to be traced; and &s;uch, as de&s;erve to be revived clearly: the lan|guage

they left there, the religion they taught the Savages, manife&s;ted it; otherwi&s;e how come those many Britti&s;h words (not much altred from the dialect) among&s;t the Mexicans? whence had they the u&s;e of Beads, of Crucifixes, of Reliques &amp;c? all which the Spaniards (as we tcad in <HI>Lopez de Gomera</HI> and others) confe&s;&s;e they found among&s;t the Canibals, and tho&s;e of <HI>Acu&s;ano,</HI> and <HI>Culhuacan</HI> at their fir&s;t landing in <HI>America.</HI> Yea, &s;ome tra|dition and reports among&s;t the Mexicans, that (about the time that <HI>Madoc</HI> was there) a &s;trange people came thither in Corraughs or Ships, who taught them &s;ome knowledge of God, and by who&s;e examples they became more civill and indu&s;trious: te&s;tified by <HI>Columbus, Franci&s;cus Lopez, Coz|tezo, Po&s;tellus</HI> and other Ca&s;tilians of quality; that of <HI>Fernando Cortez,</HI> (<HI>Anno Domini</HI> 1519 Amba&s;&s;ador and Generall for <HI>Ferdinand</HI> and <HI>I&s;abell</HI>) is al&s;o remarkable. In &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e betwixt him and <HI>Mutezuma</HI> (&s;econd &s;onne of <HI>Antzol,</HI> and Father of <HI>Quabutimoc</HI> la&s;t King of <HI>Mexico,</HI>) the Amba&s;&s;ador ob&s;erving the Indians to have many ceremonies the Spaniards u&s;ed, demanded of the King who fir&s;t in&s;tructed them, who an&s;wered <HI>Cor|tez;</HI> That many yeeres ago a &s;trange Nation landed there, a civill people, and from examples of piety they received them; but how they were cal|led, or whence they came he could not &s;atisfie him. Another time, in an Oration of thanks which <HI>Mutezuma</HI> returned them for &s;ome favours, hee thus told them. One chiefe cau&s;e of my e&s;peciall affection to your Nati|on is this, I have many times heard my Father &s;ay, hee heard his Grand&s;ire &s;eriou&s;ly affirme (out of a continued tradition) That not many De&s;cents above him, his Progenitors came thither as &s;trangers by accident, in com|pany of a Noble man, who abode there a while and then departed, but left many of his people behind him; and that upon his returne, mo&s;t of tho&s;e he left, died: and that from him or &s;ome of them they thought they them&s;elves di&s;cended. A &s;peech agreeing with our Narration: and that this people were Wel&s;h rather than Spaniards, or others, the Records of this voyage writ by many Bardhs and Genealogi&s;ts confirme it; memoriz'd al&s;o by tho&s;e learned Poets <HI>Cynwric op Grono</HI> and <HI>Guten Owen</HI> (who lived in <HI>Edward</HI> the fourths time) and by Sir <HI>Meredith ap Ree&s;e</HI> a valiant and lear|ned man, living in the yeare 1477. and of <HI>Madoc</HI> in this Eulogie.

proofes of what I wi&s;h were generally allowed of. Nor is it a phanta&s;ie of ye&s;terday, many worthy men of late and antient times have revived it: &s;uch are <HI>Cynwrie ap Grono, Meredith ap Rhyce, Guten Owen, Lloyd, Powell, Pris, Hackluit, Bronghton, Purchas, Davys,</HI> &amp;c. Enough to &s;atisfie the wel|willers of truth; too mush foe Zolli&s;ts and &s;uch as delight in oppo&s;ition. This, no doubt had it beene &s;o de&s;ervedly knowne and Catholiquely be|eeved as it merited; then had not <HI>Chri&s;topher Columbus</HI> (a man in truth, honourable and idu&s;trious) <HI>Americus Ve&s;pu&s;ius, Magellan,</HI> nor others ca|ried along with them all the honour in &s;o great an enterpri&s;e: Nor had Prince <HI>Madoc</HI> beene defrauded of his memory, nor our Kings of their ju&s;t right and Title to the We&s;t Indyes (a &s;ecret fate as it were miraculou&s;ly renuing their claime by <HI>Columbus</HI> his proffering the di&s;coverie and wealth of tho&s;e Countries to our King <HI>H.</HI> 7.) nor then had his Holine&s;&s;e, nor his Catholique Maje&s;tie had that plea nor immediate Intere&s;t grounded upon the Genoans di&s;covery, as many Je&s;uits and State-politiques have &s;o ve|hemently, &s;o late di&s;puted for. Farre be it from me or any hone&s;t man to detract <HI>Columbus,</HI> or to derogate from his de&s;erved glory: It may be his di&s;covery was (as <HI>Madocks</HI> was) meerely from his owne skill, genius, and magnanimity, without knowledge of <HI>Madocks</HI> former being there, or of en|couragement from old conjectures: his greate&s;t rea&s;on I know, was that &s;o much of the 360 degrees could &s;carce be Ocean &amp; that he might as well di&s;cover We&s;tward as the Portugalls had done Ea&s;t to the other Indies. But this I would withall have al&s;o granted; That this his voyage was after the other (of our Country-man) three hundred and two &amp; twenty yeares; and that the Spaniards have not &s;o much right to tho&s;e Countries (I meane of <HI>America</HI>) as our King has; &s;o long as they arrogate their claime from a primier di&s;covery.</P>
<P><HI>Columbus</HI> was borne at <HI>Gugureo</HI> (at <HI>Nervi</HI> &s;ome &s;ay) not far from <HI>Genoa:</HI> a man of a mode&s;t nature, &s;tudious, and well read in the Mathematiques: and of that, chiefly in Navigation: His fir&s;t encouragement of going We&s;t upon di&s;covery, grew (as &s;ay the Spaniards) from his peru&s;ing an Ephe|merides writ by a Spani&s;h Mariner, who had beene forced into the We&s;t Indies by tempe&s;t, and died at <HI>Columbus</HI> his hou&s;e upon his arrivall: this is a Spani&s;h lye, invented meerely to derogate from his worth, and that an Italian &s;hould not ma&s;ter &s;o much glory. Whither <HI>Columbus</HI> had any illu|mination from old Poets, or that he had &s;eene or heard of <HI>Madocks</HI> journey We&s;tward, who knowes: for, what Nation formerly knew not the acts of Engli&s;h-men better than them&s;elves: otherwi&s;e, <HI>Polidore Virgil</HI> that craf|tie Monck had not andertooke to illu&s;trate (to his and our &s;hame) the Engli&s;h Cronologie, nor <HI>Ver&s;tegan</HI> (alias <HI>Rowley</HI>) dar'd to make us all Teu|tonicks; from both which wee &s;uck to many egregious fal&s;hoods. <HI>Co|lumbus</HI> armed with much confidence, &s;ends his brother to our King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, the wi&s;e&s;t in his time and mo&s;t noble, if too much avarice had not &s;wayed him: who&s;e ill hap it was to &s;light the Me&s;&s;enger and his Me&s;|&s;age, from his incredulous heart and the poverty of <HI>Columbus,</HI> who in his pa&s;&s;age had been impri&s;oned by Re&s;calls, and nakedly (after much intreaty) delivered.
