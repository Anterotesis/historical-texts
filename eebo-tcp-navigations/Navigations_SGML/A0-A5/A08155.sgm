<P>_COunt Mansfield, Generall of the King of Bohemia's Army in the Field, hauing receiued intelli|gence, that the Baron de Tilly (Generall of the Bauarian Ar|my) &s;ought all the meanes hee could deui&s;e, to bring the remai|nder of the Lower Palatinate (which yet conti|nueth in the Kings hand) vnder the Bauarian &s;ub|jection; intending, before all el&s;e, to take in Hey|delburgh, the chiefe&s;t Towne thereof, and (for that end) &s;urprized &s;ome other &s;maller Townes, as Hil&s;pach and Neckergemont, di&s;tant a little mile from Heydelburgh, and lying vpon the Necker: with more then Turki&s;h or barbarian cruelty hee did there put them all to the Sword, making no &s;pare either of Man or Woman, old or young, per|forming this in &s;uch outragious manner; that hee and the Spaniards had &s;et downe their re&s;t and full account, to haue the whole Lower Palatinate (in a very &s;hort &s;pace) &s;ubjected vnder their obedi|ence.</P>
<P>Hereupon Count Mansfield, acco~panied with Sir Horatio Vere, worthily determined, with all their
<PB N="2" REF="3">powers to with&s;tand their intru&s;ion; and therefore made ordination of their Armies (being in readi|nes) to march neere, and to re&s;i&s;t the &s;aid De Tilly.</P>
<P>But then con&s;idering, that Purlach, the Mar|que&s;&s;e of Baden, being their neighbour, not ha|uing as yet &s;hewne him&s;elfe, which &s;ide he fauou|red and inclined vnto, they iudged it very fit and conuenient, before they pre&s;umed on the enter|pri&s;e; to mooue the &s;aid Marque&s;&s;e (as their friend and Neighbour) to lend his helping hand, &s;o Chri|&s;tianlike and nece&s;&s;ary a bu&s;ine&s;&s;e duely con&s;ide|red, again&s;t the precedent barbarian cruelty.</P>
<P>When the noble Marque&s;&s;e, with a valiant and heroyick &s;pirit, &s;hewed him&s;elfe willing &s;o to doe: vpon a Military Councell fir&s;t holden, it was con|cluded, that the &s;aid Marques &s;hould quarter him|&s;elfe on the frontiers of the Palatinate, along by the Bayliwicke of Bretten, and &s;o farre as to Winx|cen, a &s;mall-Emperiall Towne vpon the Necker, to the intent, that if the Enemy came to make his re|treat there: both his owne Countrey and that of Wertenbergh, might by him bee freeed and de|fended, again&s;t the fore&s;aid Bauarian Army, which mu&s;tred it &s;elfe together from Kreyckaw, towards the afore&s;aid Towne of Wi&s;loch, a place of good and great aduantage, for him that could winne fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;sion thereof, by rea&s;on of the narrow
<PB N="3" REF="3">pa&s;&s;ages, and a &s;mall Riuer running by it.</P>
<P>While they were &s;eriou&s;ly imployed about this bu&s;ines, Count Mansfield the Generall was prepa|red to march forward, intending to pa&s;&s;e ouer the Rhine, and &s;et vpon the &s;aid Bauarians: On a &s;ud|den, the King of Bohemia him&s;elfe in per&s;on (in ve|ry apt time, &amp; before noone) came that day to Ger|mer&s;heim, hauing formerly pa&s;t through France, Loraine, and the Garri&s;ons of Leopoldus and the Spaniards, in vnknowne and di&s;gui&s;ed apparell. There he found an Amba&s;&s;ador, that had bin &s;ent from the Infanta, who&s;e onely me&s;&s;age was, to in|treat and per&s;wade the &s;aid Count Mansfield, to leaue &amp; for&s;ake the King of Bohemia; whereto he returned a rough an&s;wer, and &s;o &s;ent him away, re|&s;oluing to proceed on in the former intended en|terpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Count Mansfield hauing taken good order, for defence of the places belonging to the Palatinate, along by the riuer of Rhine: his forces &amp; military preparations, which were on this &s;ide of the Rhine, he cau&s;ed to March directly towards the Enemy, who lay encamped in the way to Kieyckaw, vpon a Mount, and in the Vineyards hard by the Towne of Wi&s;loch, where hee had planted &s;ixe Pieces of Ordinance, and wherewith (at the fir&s;t) he &s;hot at the King of Bohemia's forces, which was on Thur&s;|day
<PB N="4" REF="4">in the Euening, but did them no hurt. In the meane while, the Kings Dragons skirmi&s;hed with the Enemy, and tooke &s;ome of them Pri&s;oners: but they could not get to the Enemies quarter, in re|gard of the narrow pa&s;&s;ages, wherefore becau&s;e it was night; they were con&s;trained to retire into Mengel&s;heim, a Village di&s;tant halfe a mile from thence, where now they lodge.</P>
<P>The next day being the 17. day of Aprill (the day of Battaile) the Army being raunged in good order for Fight, the Vanguard marched (led by the Duke of Weymar, Lim&s;tar, Obeitrant, and the Earle of Ortenberg,) before Noone towards the Enemy, as hoping to &s;et vpon him. But the Ene|my hauing aduantage of the Countryes &s;cituation (which was no meane helpe to him) &s;et furiou&s;ly on them with all his Regiments, and in &s;uch &s;ort, as, although they carryed them&s;elues valiantly: yet after they had long with&s;tood the Enemies great power, &amp; done them much harme; they were for|ced to retire with lo&s;&s;e of about 45 men. Captaine Berlenger being one among them. And becau&s;e the way was &s;o &s;traight and narrow, and the Hor&s;e paced clo&s;e together in the retreat, the Switzers Regiment was &s;omewhat hard pre&s;t on with lo&s;&s;e of about 25 men The&s;e are all the men that were lo&s;t on the Kings &s;ide, in the fir&s;t Fight and retreat.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>The enemy being puft vp with pride, vp|on this &s;mall aduantage and &s;ucce&s;&s;e, fol|lowed them, and changed the place of his Campe, ouer taking (in the retrait) a wagon with two &s;icke <HI>Switzers</HI> in it, that could not &s;oone enough &s;hift for them&s;elues. And to make apparence of his rage and crueltie, him&s;elfe &s;et fire to the wagon, that they might endure the more mercile&s;&s;e death. Now he per&s;waded him&s;elf vpon this poore retrait, that he had already obtained the vi|ctory; which made him crie out in a braue|rie: <HI>Go on, go on, march on ward, for they are ours, they are all ours.</HI> And although the weather was exceeding foule, yet notwith&s;tanding he v&s;ed &s;uch diligence, that he got the means to place his Ordenance on a hillock beyond <HI>Meugel&s;heim,</HI> and in &s;uch a conuenient place, as he &s;hot from thence into the Kings army, but yet did them no hurt, becau&s;e (from thence) they could not well &s;ee it.</P>
<P>After noone, Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> the Gene|rall, appointed the army to march from <HI>Meugel&s;heim</HI> afore&s;aid, and to take a conue|ent place behind the &s;aid village, in order of
<PB N="6" REF="5">battell, where likewi&s;e the Ordenance was planted on a place of good advantage, to hurt the enemie. He perceiuing that the Kings forces vvere gone from the &s;aid vil|lage, became verily per&s;waded that they vvere fled and gone, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed vvith no meane error and feare. And this per&s;wa&s;i|on vvas the more confidently embraced, becau&s;e Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> had &s;et the &s;ayd village on fire; which vvas done by him to no other end, but, by meanes of the &s;moke, to muffle the enemyes &s;ight, for the better clouding of his army, that the forme and condition thereof might not be di&s;cerned, vntill he had &s;ettled it in a co~uenient place for the battell.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner vvas the Generall gone from the village, but the enemy came &amp; tooke it, although he was to make his way through a narrow pa&s;&s;age, and likewi&s;e ouer a &s;mall bridge, vpon vvhich, not aboue fiue or &s;ixe hor&s;emen could ride in ranke; yet he made &s;uch ha&s;te, that he brought foure peeces of ordenance beneath the &s;aid village, &amp; plan|ted them on a &s;mall hillocke. There al&s;o he
<PB N="7" REF="5">cau&s;ed his Regiments to pa&s;&s;e ouer the &s;aid bridge, to pur&s;ue the King of <HI>Bohemiaes</HI> ar|mie; which hee thought vvas partly put to flight, becau&s;e from thence he could not di&s;|cerne it. So that all the chiefe Commanders placed them&s;elues in the forefront of the battell, to expre&s;&s;e their forwardne&s;&s;e and to win bootie.</P>
<P>When the King of <HI>Bohemiaes</HI> Armie was ordered in due forme for battell, the King him&s;elfe and the Generall <HI>Mansfield</HI> rode round about it, exhorting them to valiant &amp; manly behauiour, and to win againe with a &s;prightfull recouerie, the honor lo&s;t at <HI>VVit|tenberg</HI> by <HI>Prague.</HI> Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> like a braue Generall, marching in the front of the Armie, once more moued his &s;ouldiers to carie them&s;elues boldly and couragiou&s;ly, for now they had time be&s;t fitting for it, when in the Kings owne &s;ight and pre&s;ence they might make rare expre&s;&s;ion of their va|lour as often before (in diuers good oppor|tunities) they had worthily done. And now the King him&s;elfe was royally re&s;olued to fight in per&s;on with them; not doubting
<PB N="8" REF="6">but (by Gods help) he &s;hould haue the victo|ry. So he cau&s;ed the Vanguard to march on, being led directly vpon the enemie; &amp; one of his ordenance hauing twi&s;e di&s;charged conueniently on the enemie, the &s;aid Van|guard made a valiant a&s;&s;ault; yet &s;eeming as if they retired againe, the enemie pur&s;ued; but vvere &s;o &s;uddenly and fiercely a&s;&s;ailed by the re&s;t of Count <HI>Mansfields</HI> forces, as they vvere enforced to a di&s;ordered rety|ring, hoping thereby to &s;aue them&s;elues: but by rea&s;on of the little bridge, and &s;o &s;trict narrowne&s;&s;e of the pa&s;&s;age, vvithin a quarter of an houres &s;pace, or thereabout, the enemy found him&s;elfe &s;o confounded and ouerthrowne, that he lo&s;t aboue 2000 men in the field, as the pri&s;oners (among vvhich vvere diuers principall Officers, as the Sergeant Maior, the Prouo&s;t Generall, <HI>Har&s;els</HI> Colonell of <HI>Wersbergh,</HI> Lieutenant of the troupes of hor&s;e, and many other officers) them&s;elues confe&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>The enemy lo&s;t eight Cornets, and a|mong them two great Standards or Ban|ners, one of vvhite Damaske, vvherein
<PB N="9" REF="6">vvere the&s;e vvords: <HI>In Domino &s;perantes, in to non confundantur.</HI> The other Standard was of red Damaske, hauing on the one &s;ide a blacke Eagle, and on the other &s;ide the Armes of <HI>Bauaria,</HI> with the <HI>Golden Fleece</HI> round about it, and vnder it was written, <HI>Adiutorium Domini &s;it inim&icirc;cis terror.</HI> In a third great Cornet, much &s;poyled, there &s;tood <HI>Fortune;</HI> but it was &s;o torne and tot|terd, that the Motto could not be read. There were al&s;o &s;ix En&s;ignes of footmen found, but &s;o much &s;poyled with raine and mire, that they could not be knowne. Be|&s;ides, they found a great number of hor&s;es, good &s;tore of gold, &s;iluer, and other &s;tuffe. Afterwards, there aro&s;e vp &s;ome few foul|diers from among the dead bodies, and one among the re&s;t was <HI>De Tillies</HI> Chamberlain, &s;ore wounded, who being demanded, where his Mai&s;ter was, an&s;wered, If he be not a|mong y^e dead bodies, he is &s;ore wounded; for he had bin by him in the Vanguard hauing there receiued &s;ome wounds. In the body of the battel, there were many Commanders &s;lain, &amp; 4 peeces of ordnance take~ fro~ them.
<PB N="10" REF="7">It is vvritten out of the army, that <HI>Henrick Maximilian,</HI> Baron of <HI>Papenheim,</HI> an Apo&s;tat, vvas al&s;o &s;laine.</P>
<P>The victory being thus vvon, the Kings army &s;tood in order of battell till nine of the clocke at night, in which time the King him&s;elfe vi&s;ited the Regiments vvith a chearfull countenance, thanking them for their valiant cariage in that notable ac|cident. After that, he retired and marched with the Vanguard to <HI>Langebrucken,</HI> a burnt village, from vvhence (after he had re|fre&s;hed him&s;elfe about two houres, and vvritten certaine letters, vvhich he &s;ent by Po&s;t to his friends, to let them vnder&s;tand his victory) he vvent to <HI>Bru&s;&s;ell.</HI> And Ge|nerall <HI>Mansfield</HI> with the Rereguard, two houres and an halfe after, followed him, and ariued there about breake of day.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oners freely acknowledge, that according to mans iudgement, and the &s;i|tuation of their camp, it was reputed im|po&s;&s;ible for them to lo&s;e the battell: but they a&s;cribe it to the permi&s;&s;ion of God, that would haue it to be &s;o.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="7">
<P>During this battell, there vvere many notable things con&s;idered, Fir&s;t, that al|though Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> thought it conue|nient that the King &s;hould retire him&s;elfe into a place of &s;afetie; yet that he vvould needs be there per&s;onally, and marched at the head of the Rereguard, to leade the &s;ame, and to &s;upply their places that had entred into the battell.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, that the Princes, Earles &amp; other Lords of qualitie (vvhich after &s;hall be na|med) did &s;o valiantly behaue them&s;elues in that battell, that they returned from it vvith their &s;vvords all be&s;meared vvith their enemies bloud, and vvere &s;orie for no|thing more, but that the battell la&s;ted no longer.</P>
<P>Tvvo brothers chanced to knovv each other in the fight; namely, Lieutenant <HI>Ber|hen,</HI> that tooke his brother pri&s;oner, vvho &s;erued the Duke of <HI>Bauaria:</HI> and another &s;ouldier of Count <HI>Mansfields</HI> army al&s;o tooke his brother pri&s;oner, vvho &s;erued the Bi&s;hop of <HI>VVirtsburgh.</HI></P>
<PB N="12" REF="8">
<P><HI>Bauariaes</HI> Ordenance, though they vvere often di&s;charged, did no hurt with any &s;hot they made.</P>
<P>In this battell there vvere no more then fifteene &s;ouldiers on the Kings &s;ide &s;laine.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, during this fight, it rained ex|tremely, and the ground thereby with the hor&s;es trampling was &s;o deepe and &s;lippe|ry, that the hor&s;es could hardly recouer them&s;elues out of it: and a great Raine|bow was &s;eene ouer the body of the army.</P>
<P>The newes of this ouerthrow being brought to the Gari&s;ons left in <HI>VVi&s;loch, Sintzen, Hil&s;pach, Steynach,</HI> and others vvhich the <HI>Bauarians</HI> held, in all ha&s;te made them to leaue them, and to runne away. But part of them fell into the hands of the Mar|quis of <HI>Badens</HI> &s;ouldiers, and were &s;o clo&s;ely followed, that 150 of them vvere &s;laine, and 300. taken pri&s;oners. The re&s;t of the <HI>Bauarian</HI> army is yet by Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> &s;peedily pur&s;ued; &s;o that it is certaine that the towne of <HI>Heydelberg</HI> is not wholy re|lieued from being inclo&s;ed.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="8">
<P>The God of battles to whom the honor here|of onely belongeth, continue his fauour to them that are his, &amp; poure out his vengeance on them that be his enemies, Amen.</P>
<P>After that Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> had giuen this o|uerthrow to the Armie of <HI>de Tilley,</HI> vnder com|mand of the Duke of <HI>Bauaria,</HI> the yonger Duke of <HI>Wirtenbergh</HI> came downe, as hoping that hee might now pa&s;&s;e freely, and without any dan|ger to Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> with his &s;ouldiers being 1000. hor&s;e, and 2000. foote. But <HI>Don Cordua</HI> with his Spani&s;h Army met him, and put him to flight. In which conflict, 1500. men were &s;laine, and taken pri&s;oners the Duke of <HI>Witenberghs</HI> Bro|ther, dangerou&s;ly wounded, and taken pri&s;oner, and the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Badens</HI> Sonne &s;laine, be|&s;ide the lo&s;&s;e of two peeces of Artillerie.</P>
<P>But <HI>Turlach</HI> the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Baden</HI> comming likewi&s;e downe, attended with 15000. men, for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the king of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> collected together the &s;cattered troopes of the Duke of <HI>Witenberghs,</HI> with whom, and his owne &s;ouldiers he encountred <HI>Don Cordua,</HI> &s;lue more then 3000. of his men, and not onely recouered the Artille|ry lo&s;t before; but likewi&s;e all the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Artille|ry to it, making him&s;elfe (by this good meanes)

<P>But the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicke</HI> perceiuing his purpo&s;e, withdrew his forces to a place of good conueniencie, and getting behinde them, placed his hor&s;e in a wood with eight pee|ces of Ordnance, hereupon the Spaniards beganne to charge the footemen Souldiers ve|ry hotely, which they pollitickely perceiuing drew them&s;elues &s;till backeward, till at the la&s;t they came to their owne Ordenance, but when they had the enemy within reach of their &s;hot, they then brauely gaue fire,

<P>The Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicke</HI> pur&s;uing his vi|ctorie, marched the next day to <HI>Guesken,</HI> which he ingirt about, and &s;hot balls of wild-fire into into it; at which time all they which fled out of it were &s;lain, and the re&s;t burnt.

<P>After this vpon the 15. of Maie, the king of <HI>Bohe|mia</HI> with his army in order of battle marched fro~ <HI>Gemer&s;hcime</HI> to <HI>Hagenaw</HI> to rai&s;e the &s;iege before it, which the Arch Duke <HI>Lepoldus</HI> vnder&s;tanding pre&s;ently &s;ent 1000 hor&s;e men, &amp; &s;ome footmen to <HI>Wii&s;enbergh</HI> a rich towne lying in the way be|tweene <HI>Hagenaw</HI> &amp; <HI>Germer&s;heime</HI> to take the &s;ame,
