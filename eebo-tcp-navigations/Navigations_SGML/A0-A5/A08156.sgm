<HEAD>MATTERS CON|CERNING THE PALATI|NATE, WITH THE DEFEAT of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tilley</HI> in the Palatinate, and the Duke of Memorancy in <HI>France.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THere are two &s;orts of men in the world, compared to tame and wilde bea&s;ts, and the&s;e are flatte|rers and detractors, and that wor|thily: For what vice may he pre|dominant in a Prince, or Com|mon wealth, which a flatterer can|not guild ouer with the faire appearance and colours of vertue: and what bu&s;ine&s;&s;e can pre&s;ent it &s;elfe on the &s;tage of this world, but a detractor will calum|niate and de&s;ire it; which is more apparant at this in|&s;tant in the combu&s;tions of <HI>Europe,</HI> then euer was heard of in many ages: for how many be there that &s;ooth vp the humour of &s;ome kings (be&s;ides the Ie|&s;uites, who&s;e profe&s;&s;ion is blinde ignorance, and &s;u|per&s;titious zeale, euen to &s;et forward impietie) to &s;tand vpon termes of &s;oueraigntie and imperiou&s;|ne&s;&s;e, as is great rea&s;on in Monarchies, though the &s;ubiects be &s;laughtered, the countrey deua&s;ted, the people mangled, the peace dilacerated, the Churches abandoned, religion defaced, and God bla&s;phemed: and how many be there that di&s;credit the cau&s;e of
<PB N="6" REF="3"> di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Princes, and the thriuing of religious bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;es, although the finger of God doth point it out that fairer daies &s;hall follow &s;tormy weather, which is mo&s;t apparant concerning the <HI>Bohemian</HI> affaires, and the <HI>Palatinates</HI> recouery, wherein both flatterer and detractor &s;tep on the &s;tage of this world to act their Scenes with deceitfull hurts and malitious in|tents. The flatterer carryed away with outward &s;howes of the Papacy, and <HI>Catholicke</HI> Princes, will not apprehend, that there can be any determination of their greatne&s;&s;e, but cry out with <HI>Nabuchadnezer</HI> to wor&s;hip the golden image of their Monarchy. The detractor &s;haking his head, and biting his lip at any &s;ucce&s;&s;e &s;hall happen, and deriding the bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e, as if the Gyants attempted to fight again&s;t hea|uen. Thus haue they magnified the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> and the proceedings of the Empire: thus haue they di&s;credited the King of <HI>Bohemias</HI> attempts, and &s;et &s;trange characters on his actions.</P>
<P>But as in all di&s;putations there is a Moderator: &s;o would I might now meete with &s;uch men, as will &s;tand Neuters, and neither preuaricate iudgement, nor ouerthrow veritie: and if the higher matters are too tran&s;cendent for their capacitie, yet let them giue way to true relations, and hone&s;t reports, without &s;cornes, or cachinations: but becau&s;e I &s;hall neuer haue my expectation &s;atisfied in this kind in regard of the multiplicy of humours in a common wealth, I leaue them all to bee deceiued them&s;elues, or deceiue others, and onely apply my &s;elfe in this di&s;cour&s;e to &s;uch men, who out of ciuill hone&s;tie entertaine good newes with ioy, and welcome bad
<PB N="7" REF="3"> with commi&s;eration and pittie, making this v&s;e of both, that God is the manife&s;ter of his owne iudge|ments and mercy to all the world. And &s;o to the bu|&s;ine&s;&s;e in hand, and to tell you what hath hapned of late in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> &s;ince the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> came there, and chanced in other places as the cau&s;e hath thriued, and men haue had their mindes &s;tirred vp with good affections.</P>
<P>Know then, that the fifteenth of our Aprill, and the fiue and twentieth <HI>Stilo nouo,</HI> 1622. there came letters from <HI>Stuchgaret,</HI> that a thou&s;and hor&s;e, and foure thou&s;and foote of Duke <HI>Weymers</HI> of <HI>Saxony</HI> arriued at <HI>Laffen</HI> ouer the Neckar, who brought word that the next day there will be al&s;o 3000. at <HI>Rottenburg</HI> for the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Baden,</HI> who co~meth in per&s;on to &s;et forward the <HI>Bohemian</HI> cau&s;e. But the &s;ame day there was a mixture with as bad newes: for they will haue it that Generall <HI>Tilley</HI> came to neather <HI>Gemunds</HI> a prety great towne, and as hee &s;erued the pea&s;ants in the villages, &s;o he v&s;ed the peo|ple in this place, killing all the &s;ouldiers, &s;laughtring mo&s;t part of the Burghers, torturing the preachers, and &s;paring neither Captaine nor officers, nay the very &s;chollers were &s;ubiect to his fury, &s;o that it &s;ee|med he was either blinde with ignorant zeale, or mad with intemperate rage.</P>
<P>A little before <HI>Leopaldus</HI> had &s;ent downe a 1000. &s;ouldiers into his countrey, who had pa&s;&s;age euen by permi&s;&s;ion of the people and &s;ome towne garri|&s;ond with <HI>Mansfields</HI> men to march ouer the bridge toward <HI>Haggenaw,</HI> and I mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e, that though
<PB N="8" REF="4"> <HI>Leopaldus</HI> hath beene much di&s;appointed in his ex|&s;pectation for diuers troopes out of <HI>Italie,</HI> and mo|ney from <HI>Spaine,</HI> yet came their &s;ouldiers dayly from <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and certaine companies of <HI>Swi&s;s</HI> are ready to mar&s;hall a prety army in <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> had not the the garri&s;on of <HI>Haggenaw</HI> made a fearefull &s;alley vp|on &s;ome &s;cattered troopes, killed diuers &s;ouldiers, and brought eight Captains of hor&s;e into the towne, which when the re&s;t vnder&s;tood, whom <HI>Mansfield</HI> had placed in the villages, and loath to be behinde their fellowes in glorious exploytes and profitable booty, they likewi&s;e drew to a head of three thou|&s;and, and approched a village in which were fifteen-hundred of <HI>Leopaldus</HI> men, whom they not onely frighted with an alarum, but di&s;comfited with a great &s;laughter, taking &s;ome pri&s;oners, and many armes: but you mu&s;t know in the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters it is farre better here then with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tilley,</HI> becau&s;e the &s;ouldiers haue an ordinary ran&s;ome, and vpon &s;urpri&s;als, there is an ordinary deliuery, wherein and whereby Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> hath gotten &s;uch a reputation for the faire &s;parings of all people that &s;ubmit, or yeeld him con|tribution, that the better &s;ort commended his di|&s;cretion and military cu&s;tomes, and inferiors pray for his &s;ucce&s;&s;e and augmentation of honour, e&s;pecially clap their hands for ioy, when they heare him cry out for the Co&s;pell, and the King of <HI>Bohemia.</HI> Yea I will be bold to &s;ay that the&s;e warres haue made more true hearted Prote&s;tants, then all the flatteries of Peace, and wantonne&s;&s;e of pro&s;peritie could euer doe.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="4">
<P>Much about this time (and here I pray you par|don me for precedencie of Dayes, or Actions; for I would be loth to tye you or my &s;elfe to &s;uch &s;ear|ches: it is &s;ufficient, that you &s;hall receiue the Re|lations fully, hone&s;tly, and truely, as they chaunced) And &s;o I &s;ay, much about this time Count <HI>Mans|field</HI> came to <HI>Germi&s;hem</HI> with three Regiments, whi|ther al&s;o repaired Mon&s;ieur <HI>Rauillau,</HI> to treat with him about matter of great importance, e&s;pecially a Truce: but hee now an&s;wered, that hee could not determine of any thing, vntill the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> were &s;etled, who &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;&s;e at his owne plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Vpon the necke of this, as wee &s;ay, there came a&s;|&s;urance of the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Badens</HI> preparation to the Warre: who &s;ent word, that his Armie was in a readine&s;&s;e, but hee would willingly haue a Campe at <HI>Durmi&s;hem,</HI> as being able to keepe the Field him|&s;elfe, hauing leuied Souldiers, and trayned Bands, to the number of ten thou&s;and, be&s;ides Waggons and Munition, Carriages and Pioners, with all other Furniture belonging to a great Captaine: Nay, his Cu&s;tomes were &s;o Religious, that in the midde&s;t of his Troupes hee ob&s;erued the Sabboth, and com|manded both Prayer and Fa&s;ting for one Meale in the &s;ame, when&s;oeuer hee determined any Attempt, or &s;et him&s;elfe a-worke for befitting Enterpri&s;es. To this you may adde the Arriuall of Palatine <HI>Lodo|wick Phillips</HI> at <HI>Germer&s;teme,</HI> and many Friends in o|ther places, as true fore-runners of the King of <HI>Bo|hemia's</HI> comming indeed.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="5">
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tilley</HI> all this while ranged vp and downe, and &s;ometimes &s;hewed his Hor&s;e in the Fields before <HI>Ladenberg,</HI> and &s;ometimes came with his Foot to giue Alarums to <HI>Heydelberg,</HI> and &s;ome|times terrified the Townes with diuers Outrages, and at all times watched opportunitie, to be reuen|ged on Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> or at lea&s;t to take him at aduantage in &s;ome Expedition, that hee might ac|knowledge hee had a Souldier to his Aduer&s;arie, and as great a de&s;eruer of Renowne as him&s;elfe: In which cour&s;es hee continued, to the affrighting both of Townes, Villages, People, and the whole Armie, till the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> came indeede; by who&s;e occa&s;ion, the &s;econd Battaile, which is promi&s;ed you, chanced, as you &s;hall heare here|after; though for my part I could bee contented with the Title of a Skirmi&s;h. The denomination of Battaile carryes too much terror with it, and too much curio&s;itie of di&s;tinction, as beeing the highe&s;t part of Militarie Di&s;cipline: in which, many circum&s;tances are to bee con&s;idered, as mu|tuall Agreement, a Day appointed, the Trenches ca&s;t open, the maine Forces vnob&s;cured, the Troopes orderly mar&s;halled, the Cannon placed, and in a word, a preparation made to Death and Slaughter, as you &s;ee a Fea&s;t appointed to entertaine &s;ome great Prince.</P>
<P>Now came the time, the long-wi&s;hed time of the arriuall of the King into the Palatinate, about which there is &s;ome di&s;paritie of reports. For &s;ome will haue his Armie to meet him after his Conuoy
<PB N="11" REF="5"> from the Duke of <HI>Bulloigne:</HI> Some &s;ay, hee tooke Waggon, for the ea&s;e and accommodating his Per|&s;on; and &s;ome &s;ay, hee out-&s;tripped the Armie, and came onely with three Po&s;t-hor&s;e to <HI>Gern&s;hem,</HI> from whence, hee &s;pent three &s;euerall dayes in vi&s;iting <HI>Mainhem, Franckendale,</HI> and <HI>Heydelberg:</HI> in all which places, according to the common acclamations in welcomming their Princes, as their Ioy exceeded, their Ceremonies augmented; and the Prince &s;aw plainly, it was no common cu&s;tome of the peoples welcomming their Princes, who&s;oeuer they be, but a heartie de&s;ire to &s;hew their loue and obedience vnto him, who had ventured his life to come among&s;t them, and would neuer de&s;i&s;t, till they were recom|penced for their lo&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But it was too &s;oone to begin &s;o effectually, and &s;o there pa&s;&s;ed at this time a reciprocal thankfulne&s;&s;e and ceremonie betweene them: yet in my con&s;cience it lacked &s;ome feruency, becau&s;e the ignorant people imputed &s;ome vnkindne&s;&s;e vnto him, in regard that by his for&s;aking of them, they were compelled to for|&s;ake their hou&s;es, and inheritances, to leaue them to a &s;trangers v&s;urpation. But this a&s;per&s;ion was quickly wiped away with a gentle hand of ob&s;eruation, and a pre&s;ent entertaining of new ioy, e&s;pecially that they now hoped, that the&s;e &s;trange Harpies which deuou|red their plentie, &s;hould eyther bee expul&s;ed by the valour of <HI>Zetes</HI> and <HI>Culines,</HI> or enforced to a compo|&s;ition, which might deliuer euery one his portion a|gaine: which although it &s;eemed now a little dimini|&s;hed, yet they well hoped, time and good husbandry
<PB N="12" REF="6"> would reduce to her pri&s;tinate fulne&s;&s;e and hand|&s;omene&s;&s;e: To which they were the rather induced, becau&s;e the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Baden</HI> hath much augmen|ted Count <HI>Mansfields</HI> Army, by vniting their For|ces together, and vi&s;iting King <HI>Frederick,</HI> who can|not be &s;aluted otherwi&s;e, nor receiue any Character, then the King of <HI>Bohemia.</HI></P>
<P>When the&s;e Princes were thus &s;olemnly met, and that a Councell of Warre had re&s;olued on &s;ome things worthy their pre&s;ence, and &s;o great an Army; Mon&s;ieur <HI>Rauille</HI> was di&s;charged, and &s;ent home without an an&s;wer: For they were re&s;olued to haue no Peace, but to make way to new fortunes by &s;harpe Swords.</P>
<P>In the meane while that the&s;e things pa&s;&s;ed in the Palatinate, <HI>Bauaria</HI> &s;u&s;pecting the wor&s;t, had ray|&s;ed more Forces of his owne, and had more &s;ent him by the Emperour: &s;o that there departed from <HI>Vppenhem</HI> ouer the Bridge eleuen Troupes of Hor&s;e into the Lantgraue of <HI>Darm&s;tadts</HI> Countrey, to ioyne with <HI>Tilley</HI> at <HI>Simpen.</HI></P>
<P>And thus nothing was expected, but Mi&s;chiefe, and Reuenge on all &s;ides: For no body dur&s;t looke out of <HI>Laudenberg,</HI> by rea&s;on of the Hor&s;emen of <HI>Heydelberg,</HI> which watched them continually; nor was there now any thing thought vpon, but watch|ing one another, to take aduantage for their owne ends and purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>And in this manner &s;tood the Bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of the Pa|latinate at this houre; and &s;o mu&s;t re&s;t a while, till you heare the newes of <HI>Sile&s;ia.</HI></P>
<PB N="13" REF="6">
<P>The Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> &s;omewhat troubled, that <HI>Lu|&s;atia</HI> was denyed him by the Emperour, remained rather di&s;contented then plea&s;ed, and &s;o gaue way to the Princes of <HI>Sile&s;ia</HI> to cal a Diet becau&s;e of the vp|rores. For the &s;ouldiers had mu&s;tred them&s;elues to a&s;&s;ault <HI>Glatz:</HI> but were repul&s;ed by the yong Earle of <HI>Thorn,</HI> who &s;lue many of them, and made them retire with great lo&s;&s;e, whereupon to preuent the wor&s;t, he entertained 150. &s;ouldiers more, who came from <HI>Wittingham,</HI> by which occa&s;ion they are &s;o &s;trength|ned and hartned, that they haue prote&s;ted to defend them&s;elues to the la&s;t man. In like manner the other Prote&s;tants are much incen&s;ed again&s;t the Bi&s;hops, and euery where there is crying out vpon the Catho|lickes tyranny, and wicked Ie&s;uites: whereupon the Bi&s;hop of <HI>News</HI> will take from them of <HI>Cuntele</HI> the v&s;e of their Churches, prohibite their a&s;&s;emblies, de|ny the reading of the Scriptures, and as ill as <HI>Iulian</HI> the Apo&s;tate, debarre the intercour&s;e of Chri&s;tians: now <HI>Cuntele</HI> is three mile di&s;tant from <HI>Meu&s;e,</HI> and was euer a priuiledged place, whither they of the religion re&s;ort, and were prowd againe to be reputed Prote&s;tants. For although in the&s;e places there was &s;ome di&s;parity betweene the Caluini&s;ts and Luthe|rans, which bred &s;ome &s;candall to the profe&s;&s;ors: yet were they all glad of the generall title of Prote&s;tants, as you &s;ee at this houre, the Papi&s;ts generally reioyce at the name of Catholicke: from the Bi&s;hops exam|ple many Prie&s;ts and officialls performed the like, but the people vnaccu&s;tomed to &s;uch indignities, from murmuring fell to oppo&s;ition, and &s;o &s;tood vp|on a guard of defence, and began &s;ome &s;lender oppo|&s;itions
<PB N="14" REF="7"> in many places, re&s;orting to the Princes and Lords of the Prouince both in towne and villages, de&s;iring them to let them haue the freedome of their &s;oules, how euer the Emperour or Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> vnder him would &s;eeme to command their bodyes, and obedience to extraordinary contributions: vpon this there is great mu&s;tring of &s;ouldiers round about and the Emperour &s;ent a new me&s;&s;enger to the Duke of <HI>Saxony</HI> to bee carefull of the gouernment. For he knew the lo&s;&s;e of <HI>Bohemia</HI> depended vpon the ab&s;o|lute reuolt of <HI>Sile&s;ia:</HI> But the truth is, they were affrayde of the Marque&s;&s;e of <HI>Ieggendorff</HI> euerie where, who for all the Parliament of <HI>Hunga|rie,</HI> and the great a&s;&s;embly there to rectifie the di&s;orders of the Common-wealth, grew &s;trong with new forces, and was reputed twen|tie thou&s;and, and feared to come again&s;t them pre&s;ently: For the countrey grew mutinous, and euery man &s;u&s;pected one another, con&s;idering the Emperour was reputed weake, and would glad|ly haue a peace, if hee knew which way to obtayne it with his honour: to which I am the rather induced, becau&s;e new Souldiers mu&s;t haue money and good entertainment, and the old were worne out with many and diuers difficul|ties; e&s;pecially &s;laughter, hunger and &s;ickene&s;&s;e; be&s;ides the Countreys lay wa&s;ted where they quartered, and the Inhabitants did not husband nor till their grounds as they were woont in former times: and this was the generall cau&s;e almo&s;t throughout all <HI>Germanie,</HI> at which the people euery where were very much mooued, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="7"> troubles aro&s;e not for Religion or the Go&s;pels &s;ake as the maine poynt of the &s;ame: but for ambitious titles, and matters of State and gouernement, of which there is neither time nor occa&s;ion to di&s;pute heere: and thus much for the remoter places.</P>
<P>Now wee may draw neere home, and come to that you de&s;ire, the &s;econd Skirmi&s;h I pro|mi&s;ed you, which was again&s;t Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tilley</HI> in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> and concerning which there are diuers reports: but this Letter is come from <HI>Crut&s;nach,</HI> wherein the Spaniards lie in Garri&s;on, and therefore I am per&s;waded they would make the be&s;t of a bu&s;ine&s;&s;e again&s;t them, and bee as &s;paring as they could to di&s;credit their owne affayres, and &s;o they tell the tale in this manner.</P>
<P>Although the Report of the King of <HI>Bohe|mias</HI> comming into the <HI>Palatinate</HI> was quickely divulged, and made knowne to all the Garri|&s;ons, e&s;pecially <HI>Openhem</HI> and <HI>Crut&s;nach,</HI> where the Spaniards lay, and had laine euer &s;ince their comming into the Countrey: &s;o that now they were very well fortified and intrenched: yet as they had beene quiet all this Winter, they were now likewi&s;e neuer &s;tartled by the rumour, &s;o that it was then &s;uppo&s;ed, that they had &s;ome priuate or &s;ecret directions &s;o to doe, or knew there was &s;ome capitulation about their remouing and rendition of the place: notwith|&s;tanding <HI>Bauaria</HI> would not bee &s;o an&s;wered, but as the Emperour had giuen him the Countrey, he would maintaine the Title, and al&s;o iu&s;tifie the
<PB N="16" REF="8"> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: but as you heard in many places, there came interpo&s;itions, and no doubt would prooue him an intruder. Be&s;ides, when it was obiected vnto him, that although the Emperour as exa&s;perated a|gain&s;t the Prince <HI>Fredericke,</HI> had done this for the pre&s;ent, and made his indignation an example of reuenge: yet either it could not la&s;t, or time would worke a reconciliation: but as for him, it mu&s;t needs be a perpetuall cau&s;e of di&s;plea&s;ure, and their po&s;te|rity in the remembrance would hunt one another in|to the fields of &s;laughter and warre. To this <HI>Bauaria</HI> replyed, let hereafter times looke to them&s;elues, hee would not goe about to preuent de&s;tiny, he had now for him&s;elfe his limitation, &amp; therefore regarded no more, then the pre&s;ent, his owne glory, and the Em|perors dignitie, which in his failing now mu&s;t needs be made a &s;corne to all nations: whereupon he pro|ceeded (as you haue diuers times heard) and was in|deed the onely &s;upportation which his Imperiall Maie&s;tie tru&s;ted vnto, as affecting the reuolt of <HI>Prague,</HI> oppo&s;ing the enemies of <HI>Bohemia</HI> and <HI>Mora|uia,</HI> repul&s;ing the &s;ouldiers which had begun in <HI>Au|&s;tria,</HI> and now maintaining an army in the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> of which hee made Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tilley</HI> Generall, who had no que&s;tion de&s;erued well of fame and report for many &s;undry actions, wherein both him&s;elfe and his Ma&s;ter had attained the reputation of good &s;oul|diers.</P>
<P>In this cour&s;e did they continue all this winter, repining at nothing more then the proceedings of Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> who was now the onely barre and hindrance of their fortunes, wherefore they watched
<PB N="17" REF="8"> all opportunities to oppo&s;e him, but hee grew too &s;trong for them, and as I may &s;ay too prowd: for he left them in &s;corne to a hard winter, and made way for his owne glory, euen through the Pallaces of Bi|&s;hops, and countreys of Catholickes, which neither <HI>Bauaria</HI> nor <HI>Tilley</HI> could preuent. Yea, when hee had done what he li&s;ted, he came backe againe among&s;t them with greater fury and more impetuous vio|lence, like the Ramme, which fighting with his ad|uer&s;ary, retireth by little and little, but not for feare or da&s;tardline&s;&s;e, but to returne with greater courage and force: thus in the meane time comes the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> as I &s;ayd, into the <HI>Palatinate</HI> a|gaine, and found <HI>Bauaria</HI> and <HI>Tilley</HI> &s;pringing with the &s;pring to new vigour and lu&s;tre, in&s;omuch that at two &s;euerall times <HI>Tilley</HI> had &s;urpri&s;ed &s;ome part of his carriages, and &s;laine &s;ome few of the reare of his army: yea he continued with that brauery, that hee did &s;hew him&s;elfe mo&s;t when the King was &s;tronge&s;t e&s;pecially after the King of <HI>Bohemia</HI> was come into the Palatinate: for then he be&s;tirred him&s;elfe indeed, and not onely &s;poyled the villages, but threatned <HI>Heydelberg,</HI> who had many alarums by his meanes, and many reports of her be&s;ieging: not thus conten|ted, he braued the campe him&s;elfe, and came out in fury to &s;et vpon the King in an audacious manner, and &s;o a skirmi&s;h began, which a little rebated his fury, but yet not eclip&s;ed his glory.</P>
<P>Here gentle Reader I know not what to &s;ay vnto thee, becau&s;e rumour is &s;pred into &s;treames con|cerning this matter: but in regard my Letter comes from <HI>Crut&s;nach,</HI> from the Spaniards, and
<PB N="18" REF="9"> that all Letters tend to one purpo&s;e, that there was &s;uch a defeat, I will follow my Copie, let other men plea&s;e them&s;elues as they li&s;t, and &s;o they tell the tale thus.</P>
<P>The King after hee had ioyned his force that <HI>Mansfield</HI> had &s;ent vnto him with Sir <HI>Horatio Vere,</HI> hauing occa&s;ion to remooue his army, was pur&s;ued, or if you will, attended vpon by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tilley,</HI> who marched along with all his forces to ouerlooke the proceedings, which was orderly performed, vn|till the King came to a bridge, where for the time he made a &s;tand, as indeede not thinking it conue|nient to pa&s;&s;e ouer, con&s;idering <HI>Tilley</HI> was &s;o neere, and in a valley be&s;ide him.</P>
<P><HI>Tilley</HI> againe coniecturing that he made this &s;tay for feare of him, came the bolder forward, and pre&s;|&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t toward him, that hee was compelled to breake through a battaile of his owne pikes with his hor&s;e, which mu&s;t needs di&s;order his foot, and which was iudiciou&s;ly di&s;couered by the King: in&s;omuch that being well prepared, hee tooke the aduantage, &s;ending &s;ome hor&s;e to entertaine the&s;e, who came &s;o forward, and aduancing with the re&s;t again&s;t the di&s;|ranked pikes that could not &s;o ea&s;ily be brought in|to forme and fa&s;hion againe, and &s;o without dwel|ling long on the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, becau&s;e they continued not long in the skirmi&s;h, <HI>Tilleyes</HI> battle was ouer|throwne, and he him&s;elfe had much adoe to e&s;cape: then followed a &s;trange &s;laughter: for there were pe|ri&s;hed and taken pri&s;oners betweene 5. or 6. thou|&s;and men, but mo&s;t of them &s;laine, and la&s;t of all it ended with &s;poyle, for the &s;ouldiers tooke away their
<PB N="19" REF="9"> armes, and &s;tripped their bodyes, leauing them na|ked to the fowles of the ayre. Thus is <HI>Tilley</HI> e&s;caped, and therefore we can &s;ay no more of him: yet onely Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> is now a &s;ubiect to talke of, and no que&s;tion will run in &s;ome violent cour&s;e of glory, if the Emperour doe not &s;peedily &s;end more forces, and rai&s;e a greater army: for in my con&s;cience this victory hath elated him more then all his former proceedings in the Bi&s;hopricke of <HI>Spires</HI> or <HI>Leopal|dus</HI> countrey: to which I haue a faire way of beleefe, in regard that heretofore <HI>Mansfield</HI> was willing to hearken to a parley, and entertained the Emperours me&s;&s;ages, and Letters about a peace: but now he gaue it out, it was onely to winne time, and to com|pa&s;&s;e his endes, which were to &s;erue the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and his comming into the Palatinate, by whom he would be both directed, and commanded, and without who&s;e permi&s;&s;ion he would not &s;o much as con&s;ent to a truce or ce&s;&s;ation of armes.</P>
<P>At la&s;t (as you haue heard) the Palatine comes vnto him, and is welcommed in euery place and applauded of all the people, &s;o that it is doubted, hee will &s;tand vpon the higher termes, becau&s;e hee hath the &s;tronger force: as for the Spani&s;h Garri|&s;ons, they are firme and well prouided, yet I &s;ee no rea&s;on for their continuance, except <HI>Baua|ria</HI> bee &s;upplyed, and a new order taken to re|nue the warre: For whether warre or peace, I am re&s;olued, that Prince <HI>Frederick</HI> will not &s;uffer vs thus to remaine in his countrey, and be as thorns in his &s;ides.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="10">
<P>To this effect was the Letter from <HI>Crut&s;nach,</HI> writ|ten by one of the Garri&s;on, and therefore I am per|&s;waded it was impartiall, and according to the Bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e: &s;o that there is hope for the generall Cau&s;e to thriue, and the particular Bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of the Palatinate to cheare vs with a new recouerie. And thus much for tho&s;e Affaires.</P>
<P>Heere is al&s;o another Letter come &s;ecretly from <HI>Paris,</HI> concerning the Kings Forces in <HI>Languedock,</HI> which I &s;uppo&s;e is very conuenient to be publi&s;hed, according to the probabilitie of the matter, and the fearefulne&s;&s;e of the Time. It is not my purpo&s;e to di&s;pute of the Actions of Princes, but to lament the poore e&s;tate of Prote&s;tants. It cannot bee hid from the eares of the World, that is not hid from the eyes of the People; and &s;o, as rumour hath told vs of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Prote&s;tants of <HI>France,</HI> good thoughts haue in&s;tructed vs to wi&s;h the pacification of their Troubles, and pray for the diuer&s;ion of the Kings anger again&s;t them, with the ce&s;&s;ation of the Warre. But it will not be: And therefore, for my part, I referre the Bu&s;ine&s;&s;e to God, who can cure the wounds of his Church, and comfort the hearts of his People, which haue of late, e&s;pecially in <HI>France,</HI> been more &s;added then euer before; in regard there is a Booke publi&s;hed in <HI>Paris</HI> of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Subizes</HI> defeat going to <HI>Rochel,</HI> whom the King followed in per&s;on, and &s;lew many of his company: this Relation filled their &s;oules with griefe, and their eyes with teares; and in &s;uch a manner the &s;orrow for the &s;ame en|crea&s;ed, that they would not admit of recouerie, and ioy, although they pre&s;ently heard, that Mon&s;ieur
<PB N="21" REF="10"> Duke <HI>de Rohan, Subizes</HI> Brother, being in the field for the Prote&s;tants in <HI>Languedock,</HI> had giuen Duke <HI>Me|morancy,</HI> the Admirall of <HI>France,</HI> a great Ouerthrow, which is thus confirmed.</P>
<P>After the Ie&s;uites had preuayled with the <HI>French</HI> King to goe again&s;t <HI>Rochel,</HI> and pro&s;ecute the Bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e of <HI>Montalbon,</HI> the Souldiers were mu&s;tered in euery place, and the Generall of the Armie proclay|med nothing but Warre and De&s;truction; yet was there Oppo&s;itions again&s;t them: and the Prote&s;tants of <HI>Prouince</HI> and <HI>Languedock</HI> well hoped, that Mon|&s;ieur <HI>De&s;guiers</HI> would take their Cau&s;e in hand, and defend their Religion; which whether he will or no, is yet doubtfull, and &s;o hangs in &s;u&s;pence.</P>
<P>But Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Rohan</HI> would not tarry for his re|&s;olution, and ray&s;ed &s;uch Forces as he could, to &s;up|ply <HI>Mountabon,</HI> and defend the Countrey: again&s;t whom was &s;ent Duke <HI>Memorancy,</HI> as Generall of the Kings Army, with other Lords and Gentlemen of qualitie; who came forward with a goodly Army, and too goodly (if it had plea&s;ed God otherwi&s;e) becau&s;e it was again&s;t their Brethren. But Kings command, and &s;ubiects mu&s;t obey: <HI>Mountmorancy</HI> comes forward apace, and <HI>Mountaban</HI> was afraid of a new ob&s;e&s;&s;ion: but it proued otherwi&s;e. For <HI>Rohan</HI> was couragious, and pre&s;umed on the Cau&s;e, though it were again&s;t his Prince: &s;o in plaine termes (as they &s;ay) they fell to a Battaile; in which, all things were ordered belonging to Martiall Di&s;cipline, but that the Lord of Battailes did di&s;order the Bu&s;ine&s;&s;e. For comming to blowes, and ioyning with furie, <HI>Memorancy</HI> gaue way, and <HI>Rohan</HI> tooke the aduan|tage:
<PB N="22" REF="11"> yet the fight continued long, and till the maine Rout was too too apparant, there &s;eemed no diffe|rence. But at la&s;t, as no extremitie can la&s;t, the Vic|torie fell to the Prote&s;tants, and the Admirall was taken pri&s;oner, with two Brothers of his Bloud; but one of them died of his wounds, and many other were &s;laine out-right: The Letter &s;ayes fiue thou|&s;and, the Rumor more, but the Religious heart &s;ayes there were too many of the&s;e, con&s;idering the Bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e was betweene Friends and Kindred, Countrey|men and of one Nation, Chri&s;tians and Neighbors, and not betweene Strangers and Enemies to the Kingdome.</P>
<P>This is that wee receiue from forraine Parts, and this is that wee hearken after in our owne Countrey: euery one wi&s;hing well to the King of <HI>Bohemia's</HI> proceedings, euery one praying truely for the afflic|ted Churches abroad; yea, cur&s;ing the Ie&s;uites for &s;uch a Doctrine, that bellowes out nothing but Warre and Death, Slaughter and Reuenge, Cruel|tie and Spoyle, when yet the Sauiour of the World bad <HI>Peter</HI> put vp his Sword, and feed his Flocke; rode with <HI>Ho&s;anna</HI> and <HI>Palmes</HI> to <HI>Ieru&s;alem,</HI> and not with Armies and Triumph; &s;ubmitted to Scornes and Buffetting, and did not reuenge him&s;elfe: And yet the&s;e men dare &s;educe the Princes of the World, and bla&s;pheme the God of Heauen, who laughes them to &s;corne for the pre&s;ent, and will in time to come ca&s;t them in a Bed of Affliction with the Whore of <HI>Babylon.</HI></P>
