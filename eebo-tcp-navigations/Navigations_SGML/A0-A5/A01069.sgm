But hearken O young man and learne, as the old man can not liue long, &s;o the young man may die quickly: certaine it is thou &s;halt die, vncertaine when, be|au&s;e thou &s;houlde&s;t alwaies liue readie to die.

<P>In like manner the olde man, hee will not thinke of death, vntill the time of his death, thinking to become a &s;udden Saint, who hath all his life time liued a wicked worldling. But hearken thou old man, and learne by the rich man in the Go&s;pell, &s;o he had al&s;o ca&s;t vp his re&s;t, hee was &s;et|led rich and ioyfull, and deferred to bee godly till he &s;aw occa&s;ion, but what &s;aith the Spirit of God: <HI>O foole this night &s;hall they take thy &s;oule from thee,</HI> this night in midde&s;t of thy ioylitie, in the &s;ecuritie of thy &s;leepe, &s;uddenly, vnwittingly &s;halt thou die.

<PB N="37" REF="23">the ca&s;ualtie in the end. I vvi&s;h therefore, that old men as they haue a pri|uiledge of yeeres, &s;o al&s;o they had the pri|uiledge of fore&s;ight heerein; that as they &s;ee their bodies bending towardes the earth, &s;o they learne to &s;end their &s;oules towards heauen, and if they &s;hould not vvi&s;h for their di&s;&s;olution with <HI>Paul,</HI> yet they &s;hould wait all the daies of their life for their changing with <HI>Iob.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, all men almo&s;t, both young and olde, rich and poore, of all fa&s;hions, and of all degrees, put off this con&s;idera|on of death, and neuer thinke or prepare to die, till they finde and feele they can no longer liue.

<P><HI>And Abraham came to mourne for Sarah and to weepe for her.</HI></P>
<P>Whether <HI>Sara</HI> died in ab&s;ence of <HI>Abraha~;</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Abraham</HI> is here &s;aid to come to mourn for her, as the Iewes affirm &s;he did, &amp; to this end faine, that whe~ <HI>Abraham</HI> was on mount Moriah to &s;acrifice his &s;onne <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> the diuell to make it a reall tragedie, repre&s;ented the manner of <HI>I&s;aacs</HI> offering vp vnto <HI>Sarah,</HI> wherevpon, &s;ay they, &s;hee tooke a conceit and died: and &s;o <HI>Abraham</HI> returning from the mount, and finding
<PB N="41" REF="25">his vvife dead, is &s;aid to come to mourne and to weepe for her. But <HI>Io&s;ephus</HI> hath &s;ufficiently refuted this fancie: For, if <HI>I&s;aac</HI> were 25. yeeres old at the time he &s;hould haue beene &s;acrificed, and <HI>Sarah</HI> after that liued 12. yeeres, how then died <HI>Sarah</HI> pre|&s;entlie, when &s;he heard from the diuel her &s;onne was &s;acrificed. Or whether hee came from burying his father <HI>Therah,</HI> as &s;ome thinke, whom the Ie&s;uite <HI>Pererius</HI> would haue to die but two yeeres before, but the truth is that hee was dead 62. yeeres before, for <HI>Abraham</HI> was now 137. yeeres olde, who vvas borne in the 70. yeere of <HI>Therahs</HI> age, who liued 205. yeeres in all: &s;o <HI>Abraham</HI> was 75. yeeres old, when his father died, to that adde 62. &s;o &s;hall wee haue <HI>Abrahams</HI> age of 137.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Gen. 12.5</NOTE></P>
<P>Or whether he be &s;aid to come becau&s;e he went out of his tent, and entred into <HI>Sarahs</HI> tent, which is mo&s;t probable: for though they &s;oiourned together, yet their tents were a&s;under, as appeareth out of the la&s;t ver&s;e of the 24. Chapter, as the
<PB N="42" REF="26">manner of tho&s;e Countries was, the men to haue their tents by them&s;elues apart, and the women their tents apart, as heere, among whom we &s;oiourne: vve &s;ee at this daie the Turkes haue their hou&s;es and their roomes apart, halfe for them&s;elues, and the other halfe for their wiues and women &s;laues: or how&s;oeuer it was, wee will not &s;o much inquire from whence he came, as the end of his comming: which was to mourne and weep for <HI>Sara,</HI> whence we ob&s;erue.</P>
<P>That naturall affection is commenda|ble in all: In <HI>Abraham,</HI> therefore in others, and that not euerie light touch of affecti|on, but a mourning and weeping, an in|ward affection, and an outward action, &s;orrow within, and &s;adne&s;&s;e without, the hearts griefe, and the eie teares mu&s;t goe together. For weeping and teares with|out, are tokens of loue within. As the Iewes gather from the teares of Chri&s;t, which he &s;hedde for the death of <HI>Lazarus,</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Iohn 11.</NOTE> Behold how he loued him, how appeares that, euen from this, And Ie&s;us wept, for

<P>Where loue is, teares are, if extremity of griefe &s;uppre&s;s not the pa&s;sio~ of loue. And therefore, God hath made men as liuing, &s;o louing creatures, to the end that they &s;hould not be as &s;tockes and &s;tones <GAP LANG="grc" DESC="foreign" RESP="OXF">, &s;en&s;ele&s;&s;e and void of affection, but that liuing and louing together, the loue of the one &s;hould not end vvith the life of the o|ther; but in token that he loued while hee liued, the &s;uruiuer &s;hould accompanie the dead to the graue vvith his teares, and weepe that they two can no longer liue and loue together.</P>
<P>Therefore the cu&s;tome of &s;ome nati|ons, to vveepe at their childrens birth, and to laugh at their death, I hold vnnaturall: for verie nature it &s;elfe (as al&s;o <HI>Euripides</HI> a meere naturali&s;t could tell vs) &s;eemeth to haue ingraffed &amp; inacted this de&s;ire into euery one: yea though he dye (for &s;ome foule offence) a &s;hamefull death, to haue yet his kinred &amp; his frends to celebrate his funerall, with their teares and lamentati|ons,

<P>Into the inheritance of which ble&s;&s;ed kingdome there is no doubt, but this wor|&s;hipfull per&s;on, I meane the meeke and vertuous Lady, <HI>Anne Glouer</HI> (who&s;e fune|rall we here celebrate) is by the free mer|cy of God entred and aduanced: for why, as &s;hee liued, &s;o &s;he died; &s;he liued a Saint, and died a Saint: and precious wee know, in the &s;ight of the Lord is the death of the Saints. In her life &s;hee loued and &s;erued God, and now being dead &s;hee liueth and raigneth vvith the Lord. Of whom I might &s;ay much, and of whom I can &s;ay little: much what I haue heard, little, yea nothing what I haue &s;eene. For it was not my hap (vvhich I count a great part of my vnhappine&s;&s;e) either to &s;ee her liuing or to heare of her life, before I heard of her death. Her life procured loue, her death, fame: who&s;e &s;wift wings, more &s;wift then the wings of loue, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great part of the world with her death,
<PB N="74" REF="42">before it knew of her life. But who could heare of her death, that did not pre&s;ently inquire of her life; and who hauing beene informed of her life, did not weepe and mourne for her death: &s;o that the hearing of her death, and the hearing of her life, and the weeping and mourning for her death; as in mee, &s;o in many met together. Sparing therefore to &s;peake much of her of whom I knew &s;o little, and yet willing to &s;peake all good of her of whom I haue heard &s;o much, I will &s;o temper my &s;peech, that I vvill neither &s;peake too much, nor too little: not too much, becau&s;e I knew &s;o little; not too lit|tle, becau&s;e I haue heard &s;o much.</P>

Shall I tell you of her bodily forme and outward feature, &s;o full of grace and beautie, that &s;hee procured many vvor|thy louers. Of her externall carriage and behauiour, &s;o louing, &s;o lowly, &s;o inno|cent; that we may rightly &s;ay of her, &s;uch vvas her name, &s;uch was her nature; a Lambe in name, and a Lambe in nature <HI>Conueniunt rebus nomina &s;aepe &s;uis,</HI> &s;o name, &s;o nature, oftentimes agree.

And &s;o indeed it happened as &s;he &s;u&s;pected; her ioy &s;oone turned into &s;orrow, and her health &s;uddenly chan|ged into &s;ickenes.
