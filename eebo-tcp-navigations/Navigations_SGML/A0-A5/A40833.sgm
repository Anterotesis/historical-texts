<HEAD>Chap. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Albertus</HI> King of <HI>Arragon,</HI> falling into a lan|gui&s;hing Di&s;ea&s;e, was advi&s;ed by his Phi&s;itians to provide for Death; and the News being &s;pread over the Country, many Magicians came to him, who told him, that if he could recover the <HI>Golden Eagle</HI> from the Queen of <HI>Ivyland,</HI> he &s;hould que&s;tionle&s;s recover his Health, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>ALbertus</HI> having of late buried the Soul of his Life <HI>Ly|&s;imena,</HI> his mo&s;t indulgent Queen, fell into extream Melancholy, which as it is commonly the Parent of all Di&s;ea&s;es, &s;o it brought him into a mo&s;t tedious and lan|gui&s;hing Sickne&s;s, which cau&s;ed him to make Moan both Day and Night; witne&s;s the bitter Groans, and pa&s;&s;ionate Ex|pre&s;&s;ions for the lo&s;s of his departed Con&s;ort: at la&s;t, being importuned by &s;everal of his Nobles, and hourly intreated by his three Sons, <HI>Philonzo, Cruentius</HI> and <HI>Innocentine,</HI> he con|&s;ented to &s;end for the chiefe&s;t Doctros in tho&s;e Parts, to con|&s;ult about the State and Welfare of his Body; which Doctors being arrived, were pre&s;ently conducted to the King's Cham|ber, at who&s;e &s;ight the King broke out into the&s;e &s;ad Ex|pre&s;&s;ions:</P>
<P><HI>Ye are come to look upon a delining King; ye may endeavour to u&s;e your Skills, but I am confident your Labour will be lost. Alas, my Di&s;ea&s;e is too inward to be found out; and if ye Cure me, it must be more by Miracle than Skill: If ye can Cure an al|mo&s;t broken Heart, or repair my half-decayed Lungs, or re&s;tore my near-wa&s;ted Breath, then draw near: But, alas, my</HI> Ly&s;ime|na&mdash; And there his Sighs denying him liberty of Speech, he made Signs to be no more troubled, and turning from the Company, and almo&s;t from his own Sen&s;es, he groaned him|&s;elf into a deep Melancholy.</P>
<P>The Doctors as yet being not thoroughly acquainted with his Di&s;ea&s;e, verily &s;uppo&s;ed him departing but it proved otherwi&s;e; for his Sons, and the re&s;t of the Nobility inform|ing
<PB REF="3">the Doctors of his Grief, de&s;ired them to u&s;e their be&s;t Endenvours for his Recovery; which accordingly they did, but finding little hopes of Life, in re&s;pect that the Di&s;temper of his Mind bad &s;o much impaired the Temper of his body, they only pre&s;cribed him Cordials, which indeed &s;omething revived and exhilerated his Spirits, but could not give the lea&s;t hopes of Life, in re&s;pect that Nature was much extenuated and weakened by his extraordinary Melancholy.</P>
<P>The King, whether le&s;s in&s;en&s;ible of his Di&s;ea&s;e, or &s;ome|what more enlivened by the Pre&s;criptions of the Doctors, de|&s;ires two of the able&s;t of them to be brought unto him, of whem he demanded their free and ab&s;olute Opinions; The Doctors after a &s;hort Pau&s;e, who having more re&s;pect to Con&s;cience than Gain, told him that they might prolong, but not Cure; and being about to proceed into further Di&s;|cour&s;e, there &s;uddenly came in &s;ome of the Nobility, and whi&s;pered with one of the Doctors, which the King percei|ving, demanded the Cau&s;e; to which the Nobility replyed, That there were newly arrived &s;everal Magicians, who hear|ing of his Maje&s;ty's Di&s;temper, came out of affectionate Duty to imploy their Skill for his Recovery; the King hearing this, di&s;mi&s;t the Doctors, and admitted the Magicians, who be|ing entred, and after the Performance of their &s;everal Duties, applyed them&s;elves in this manner:</P>
<P><HI>Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> Renowned Sir, We the most humble of all your Servants, being by Report informed of your Maje&s;ty's heavy and grievous Di&s;ea&s;e, have by our Indu&s;try found out a Means (which though a may &s;eem impo&s;&s;ible to your Maje&s;ty) will without que&s;tion re|&s;tore you to your former Health; which means (craving the Fa|vour of your Maje&s;ty's Patience) we &s;hall forthwith di&s;cover: Know then, most excellent Prince, that under the Juri&s;diction of</HI> Agrippina, <HI>that most famous and invincible Queen of</HI> Ivy|land, <HI>there is a</HI> Golden Eagle, <HI>in whom there is a &s;ecret and in|fallible Remedy for your Di&s;ea&s;e; therefore if any of tho&s;e He|roick Spirits which are belonging to your Maje&s;ty, will endeavour to procure this</HI> Eagle, <HI>your Maje&s;ty's Life will que&s;tionle&s;s be pre|&s;erved: We &s;hall not therefore trouble your Maje&s;ty's Ears with

<HEAD>Chap. II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The Magicians being gone, the King &s;ends for his three Sons, and acquaints them with what the Magicians had told him, proffering to divide his E&s;tate between them, if they could recover the <HI>Eagle</HI> from the Queen of <HI>Ivyland,</HI> wi&s;hing them to take what Trea&s;ure they would for their Occa&s;ions.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Magicians being departed, the King immediately gave Command that his three Sons &s;hould come unto him; they as diligent to obey, as he was willing to command, forthwith pre&s;ented them&s;elves before him. The King after &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e, told them now his Days were near fini&s;hed, and Nature began &s;o much to decline in him, that he was pa&s;t the Skill of Doctors; therefore let me advi&s;e you, as a dying Father, that as ye were born Brothers in Nature, &s;o to con|tinue in Affection. <HI>Sir,</HI> replyed the Elde&s;t, <HI>if it plea&s;e the Gods to di&s;po&s;e of you to Death, we must labour for that Portion of Content which may be proportionable to our Sorrows; for the Decrees of Fate are not to be re&s;i&s;ted; and one Rea&s;on tells us, that what we cannot remedy, we must patiently endure: But for my part (and I dare &s;ay as much for my Brothers) I would willingly hazard my Life for the Prolongation of yours. Sir, I hope that you will plea&s;e to apprehend that the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which are like to fall to us after your Death, do not any way incite us either to hope, or wi&s;h for it.</HI> With that, the two other Brothers not able to contain any longer; de&s;ired their Father to imploy them in any thing whereby they might expre&s;s their Obedience to him. To which the King (joyful to &s;ee their pa&s;&s;ionate Obedience) replyed, That there was but one way to &s;ave his Life, which was to do according to the Directions of the Magicians, who informed him, that if he could by any means recover the <HI>Gol|den
<PB REF="4">Eagle</HI> from the Queen of <HI>Ivyland,</HI> that then he &s;hould be re|&s;tored to his former Health; But, &s;ays he, I find it a thing im|po&s;&s;ible, therefore I &s;hall not trouble my&s;elf with the Thoughts of obtaining it, for the Queen is of that Power and Strength, that if I &s;hould pre&s;wade any to attempt it, I &s;hould be guilty of their Deaths, and &s;o depart this World with a burthen'd Con&s;cience; But, my Sons, I am very well content to leave tho&s;e Slaveries which are Attendants to a Crown; I can only pray for you, and that's my uttermo&s;t.</P>
<P>Before the King had made an end of his intended Di&s;cour&s;e, his Sons interrupted him with Sighs, that floated in Tears, and as well as their Sorrows would permit, they in mo&s;t hum|ble manner de&s;ired the King to grant them a Boon before his Departure; to which the King plea&s;ingly replyed, Enjoy your De&s;ires, provided ye ask what is nece&s;&s;ary for me to give; Speak, what is your Boon? to which they replyed, <HI>Renowned Sir, It was not long &s;ince you were plea&s;ed to ble&s;s our Ears with the Di&s;cour&s;e of the Magicians, who have a&s;&s;ured both you and us, that if the</HI> Golden Eagle <HI>can be recovered, your Health &s;hall be renewed; Then know, Sir, that as our Bodies are Derivatives from you, &s;o they are by all Laws, what&s;oever, to be at your Di&s;po|&s;ing; and here we pre&s;ent our&s;elves before you, and protest with all our Souls to hazard, nay lo&s;e our Lives, but we will obtain the</HI> Eagle; <HI>for you know, Sir, that Re&s;olution backt with obedient Affections, knows no Impo&s;&s;ibilities; Sir, we &s;hall not ari&s;e from our Knees till you have granted our Request, and at your Royal Con&s;ent, we will forthwith fly into Action.</HI></P>
<P>The King &s;eeing them thus re&s;olved, thought it &s;uperfluous to endeavour to di&s;cour&s;e them out of their Re&s;olutions, but told them, that &s;ince their Obedience made them &s;o ready to undertake &s;o great a Hazard, his Affections &s;hould prompt him, at their Return, to divide all his Trea&s;ure (which at that time was very great) among&s;t them; in the mean time he advi&s;ed them to provide them&s;elves with what Money they would, and all other Aceutrements nece&s;&s;ary for their Adven|ture, which they accordingly did.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How the King's three Sons provided for their Journy, and took leave of their Father and departed, and what happen|ed between them in their Journy.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe three Brothers having prepared them&s;elves for their Journey, came in humble manner to take leave of the King, whom they found, as formerly, very much troubled with Melancholy; but the Elde&s;t addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf unto him, began in this manner:</P>
<P>Royal Sir, We your mo&s;t obedient Sons, in order to our dear Affections, more than your Royal Command, pre&s;ent our &s;elves to crave your Ble&s;&s;ing upon us, and our De&s;igns, before our Departure, not de&s;pairing of our De&s;ires, we hum|bly crave.&mdash; The King looking upon them with a Coun|tenance that imported unexpre&s;&s;ible Grief for their Departure, rai&s;ed him&s;elf upon his Pillow, and with a &s;tretched out Arm gave them his Ble&s;&s;ing, withal advi&s;ing them as they were Brothers in Nature, &s;o to continue Brothers in Affection, and to have a care that neither Envy nor Ambition, or ambtious En|vy, &s;hould rai&s;e a factious Difference among&s;t them, but as they departed Brothers, and &s;o con&s;equently Friends, &s;o they &s;hould adventure and return in the like Amity they departed; And &s;o the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing that a dying Father can be&s;tow upon his Departing Children, accompany you; but before you go, let m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> as a Father, advi&s;e you of two things; The one is, the Plea&s;ure of the Gods by the neglect of your.

<PB REF="5">
<P>We &s;ee, dear Brothers, the many Troubles the want of Con&s;ideration brings upon us; we have (as I have weighed in my more &s;erious Thoughts) undertaken a mo&s;t dangerous, trouble&s;ome, and almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible De&s;ign; To prevent this, how &s;hall we advi&s;e? If we &s;hould return home, we &s;hould turn our noble Undertakings to Ignominy and Shame; and if we proceed, without que&s;tion we &s;hall lo&s;e our Lives; and what will the World &s;ay but this, They have the Effect of their Ra&s;hne&s;s; for the more dangerous a De&s;ign is, the more it ought to be di&s;cu&s;t; but they that like <HI>Phaeton,</HI> mount at Impo&s;&s;ibilities, &s;hall at la&s;t fall like him with Shame and Di&s;|honour; therefore, Brothers, let me hear your Advice. To which <HI>Cruentius,</HI> the &s;econd Brother, replied,</P>
<P>'Tis true, ra&s;h Beginnings have mo&s;t commonly fatal Con|clu&s;ions: For my part, as yet I never weighed the Bu&s;ine&s;s, nor the Danger, but altogether depended upon your Judg|ment as an Oracle, not dreaming but you had known the Difficulty of the Bu&s;ine&s;s: But &s;tay now, I better con&s;ider the Matter, methinks it &s;hould not be &s;o difficult, for &s;ure we three can conquer one <HI>Eagle;</HI> for, Brother, you &s;hall catch her, and I will warrant you my Brother and I will hold her; but where &s;hall we find her? Fie, Brother, quoth <HI>Philonzo,</HI> I &s;ee you as much err in the Matter, as I did in the Manner of the Bu&s;ine&s;s. This <HI>Eagle</HI> is a Bird kept for her Soveraignty in a great City walled round with Bra&s;s, pallizado'd with Iron, guarded with Lyons and Dragons, and commanded by Gy|ants, and we mu&s;t, before we come to this City, encounter with &s;everal Knights, which attend purpo&s;ely for &s;uch At|tempters as we mu&s;t be: Many have attempted, but never any as yet returned to tell the manner of their Attempts; there|fore, Brother, the Bu&s;ine&s;s is of more Intricacy than you ima|gine. O mon&s;trous, cry'd <HI>Cruentius,</HI> I am more than half dead already with the Relation, tall no more of it: What, Dragons and Bears, Lyons and Giants, Brazen Walls and I|ron Pallizadoes? Oh how am I thundred to Death! Attempt it, who will, for my part I'll &s;tarve here rather han be eaten with Bears, and Lyons, and Dragons, and &mdash; Oh horrible
<PB REF="5">Giants, not I. Brother <HI>Innocentine,</HI> What &s;aye&s;t thou to the&s;e terrible things? what, art not afraid? Well I have Fear enough for you both, but, good Brother, &s;peak. To which <HI>Innocentine</HI> the younger undauntedly replied:</P>
<P>As I am younge&s;t in Years, &s;o I am la&s;t in Speech, and I could wi&s;h I might be the lea&s;t; but in re&s;pect I am to make an&s;wer to both your Demands, I mu&s;t a little exerci&s;e your Patience: 'Tis true, the Danger is great, therefore the more noble; but had you, my Brethren, according to my Father's Advice, importuned the Gods before you had undertaken this great De&s;ign, que&s;tionle&s;s the one had not been filled with Doubts, nor the other with Fears, nor I with Shame for you both; you &s;eem to be as much di&s;plea&s;ed at my Words, as I am at your Actions; &s;hall we begin to tire, be|fore we begin to do? For Shame, let not the World have this Advantage of our Reputations: If we return home, we mu&s;t expect to undergo a Di&s;grace wor&s;e than Death; If we dye, we dye in high Attempts; who knows but the Gods may &s;hew extraordinary Favours, and &s;mile at our De&s;igns, being we do it for our dear Father's Life? If the wor&s;t come to the wor&s;t, we can but dye, and we had better do &s;o than live as if we lived not: but I perceive my Di&s;cour&s;e of|fends, I will therefore be &s;ilent.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Philonzo</HI> and <HI>Cruentius</HI> hearing the Di&s;cour&s;e of their younger' Brother <HI>Innocentine,</HI> robb'd him of his Trea|&s;ure, and left him bound in a Wood, where they afterwards lost them&s;elves.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>CRuentius</HI> hearing his Brother's Di&s;cour&s;e, which was con|trary to his Expectations, told him that he was a very ra&s;h Boy, and under&s;tood not what he &s;poke; For, &s;ays he, &s;hall we ca&s;t away our Lives, becau&s;e the World &s;hould &s;ay we died nobly? Brother, &s;ays he to <HI>Philonzo,</HI> are we bound to be Fools becau&s;e he's mad? No, let's leave him to the Thoughts of Honour, whil&s;t you and I con&s;ult what's be&s;t to do; &s;o walking a di&s;tance from him, they &s;ate down, and
<PB REF="6">began thus to expre&s;s them&s;elves: Brother <HI>Cruentius,</HI> I have both in this &s;hort time con&s;idered the Shame and the Danger, let us endeavour to ha&s;te to <HI>Me&s;emptronia,</HI> a City which I am &s;ure cannot be far from this Place, where we may refre&s;h our&s;elves, and have further Di&s;cour&s;e. But what &s;hall we do, replied <HI>Cruentius,</HI> with you fooli&s;h Boy? you perceive how refractory and incon&s;iderate he is, and makes &s;light of that Danger which we know to be very great: If we leave him, que&s;tionle&s;s he will return home and incen&s;e the King again&s;t us; what we &s;hall do in this I know not, but leave it to your Di&s;cretion. Let's force him with us, quoth <HI>Philonzo,</HI> and make him do according to our Wills; if not, we will threat|en to kill him. No, quoth <HI>Cruentius,</HI> that cannot be, for then he will pry into all our Actions, and make a Di&s;covery at our Returns; but, Brother, quoth he, our Bu&s;ine&s;s requires ha&s;te, let us therefore take away his Trea&s;ure, and bind him, and leave him in the Wood; for it's better one peri&s;h than two: and if the wor&s;t comes to the wor&s;t, that he &s;hould be unloo&s;ed and return home, we know at our return how to per&s;wade that what he has related is only Lies to di&s;grace us, and by that means to in&s;innuate the more into Favour him&s;elf, and injure us. I like this Advice well, quoth <HI>Philonzo;</HI> let us quickly put it in Execution, for the Night ha&s;tens; with that returning to <HI>Innocentine,</HI> they asked him, what he in|tended to do; who replied, What they did not. And &s;o you &s;hall, quoth <HI>Cruentius;</HI> and &s;o both running together laid hold on him, and without hearing him &s;peak, bound him, and took away his Trea&s;ure, and turning his Hor&s;e loo&s;e to range in the Woods they departed.

<P><HI>INnocentine</HI> being fa&s;t bound by his unnatural Brothers, lay till the Approach of the Evening in a mo&s;t mi&s;erable Con|dition, till at la&s;t a Hermet coming from his Cell, to take the Cool of the Evening, heard the Groans of poor <HI>Innocentine,</HI> and being moved with Pity, he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the place (I may well &s;ay) of Groans, where being come, his Eyes &s;aw, what his Heart pitied, his Heart pitied what his Hand re|lieved; for he forthwith conducted him to his Cell, and made &s;uch Preparations for him as his. Nece&s;&s;ity required, &s;o that the next Morning he was in a Condition to travel; but the Hermit viewing his Gue&s;t, read in his Countenance the Cha|racters of a noble and ingenious Di&s;po&s;ition, ob&s;erving by his Deportment, that he was not a Man of ordinary Education, be&s;ides being led by his own Inclinations, he acco&s;ts his Sra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">|ger in this manner:</P>

<P>Mo&s;t charitable Father, I could grieve that I was &s;orry for my la&s;t Misfortune, in re&s;pect that the Happine&s;s of your Acquaintance is derived from it, I'll not trouble your Patience with the di&s;cou&s;e of my Misfortune; only in &s;hort, I am go|ing upon a De&s;ign to &s;ave the Life of a renowned King, but this Misfortune hath put me out of a Capacity to follow my Intentions. Come, &s;ays the Hermit, I know your Di&s;ea&s;e, I'll be your Phy&s;ician, take this Cordial, giving him a bag of Gold and Jewels, and return no complimental An&s;wer, for I am bound to do it; and if you want a Steed, I have one for you which this very Day &s;tragled hither, pray take him and u&s;e him as your own; but for this Sword, which I intend for your u&s;e, pray return it if you live, if not, conceal the Vir|tue, for it will pre&s;erve you again&s;t all Enchantments, which are now very common to my woful Experience, neither need you fear, whom you encounter with it, for you &s;hall not want &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Innocentine</HI> not a little rejoyced at what the Hermit had told him, de&s;ired liberty to depart, in order to which the Hermit conducted him to his Hor&s;e; but it fell out that the Hor&s;e was his own, which he thought his Brothers had car|ried away with them; the Hermit ob&s;erving him look &s;o &s;trictly upon the Hor&s;e, told him that he could not promi&s;e him the like Service from the Hor&s;e, as he did from the Sword; No, Sir, quoth <HI>Innocentine,</HI> I believe I am better acquainted with the Hor&s;e than you, for Ye&s;terday he was mine, till taken from me by Misfortune: but however, I can|not but expre&s;s my hearty Thanks to you, and at my return you &s;hall know more of me; in the mean time, let Peace a|bide with you; let me only beg your Directions to <HI>Green Ivy|land,</HI> for I am altogether a Stranger in the&s;e Parts. Your ready way, quoth the Hermit, is to go to <HI>Me&s;emptronia,</HI> a City about three Leagues from hence, the way is direct through &s;everal Villages, where you may at your plea&s;ure en|quire;
<PB REF="7">but there is a Forre&s;t which lies between a little Town called <HI>Corumbus</HI> and <HI>Me&s;emptronia,</HI> where you mu&s;t have a careful Eye, lea&s;t you be &s;et upon before you can pro|vide for Re&s;i&s;tance; this is all that I can advi&s;e you, and &s;o farewel.</P>
<P>Thus they departed, and after the expence of &s;ome Hours, <HI>Innocentine</HI> came to the Forre&s;t which the Hermit told him of, where he was no &s;ooner entred, hut he was welcomed with many loud and lamentable Shrieks, which &s;truck him into Admiration; but being of an undaunted Spirit, and re|membring the &s;ad E&s;tate he him&s;elf was in the Day before, re&s;olved to find out the place where he heard this lamentable Noi&s;e; and being more directed by the Ear than the Eye; he at length effected his De&s;ires, for imemdiately in a Valley he e&s;pied two Villians about to ravi&s;h a Lady of an incompa|rable Beauty, and being pa&s;&s;ionately exa&s;perated, he flew up|on them like Lightning, but giving them leave to mount them&s;elves, they in&s;tead of fight pre&s;ently run away, percei|ving it was their Brother: <HI>Innocentine</HI> perceiving their Flight, clapt Spurs and followed them, but the Lady perceiving it, and fearful that two to one might be very di&s;advantagious, cryed out with what &s;trength &s;he had, Help, help, which <HI>Innocentine</HI> hearing, fearing &s;ome other Accident had befallen the Lady, &s;peedily returned, but when he came, he found no &s;uch matter, but the Lady being heartily glad of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> return, applied her &s;elf to him in this manner:</P>
<P>Mo&s;t noble and renowned Knight, my late Fright hath &s;o di&s;ordered my thoughts, that for the pre&s;ent I cannot return you tho&s;e Thanks which are due to your Merits; but if you plea&s;e to add one Favour more to the re&s;t, which is to conduct me to my poor Habitation (from which place tho&s;e Villi|ans you &s;aw, having &s;urprized me in a &s;olitary Walk, dragg'd me) you will very much increa&s;e my Happine&s;s. To which Reque&s;t <HI>Innocentine</HI> conde&s;cended, and in &s;hort time came to the Place where he found a welcome Entertainment: So after many Ceremonies pa&s;t between them, the Lady re|que&s;ted
<PB REF="8">to know what his Name and Birth was; to which <HI>Innocentine</HI> replied, So much confidence have I of your Worth, that I will not keep the lea&s;t of my thoughts from you; &s;o compo&s;ing him&s;elf, he told her his Name, Birth and De&s;ign, and likewi&s;e told her how his Brothers had dealt with him, which he was confident were tho&s;e whieh would have ravi&s;hed her, had not he by Providence prevented them; the Lady hearing his Relation, was much a&s;toni&s;hed, but at la&s;t recalling her&s;elf from her Admiration, proceeded as follows:</P>
<P>Mo&s;t magnanimous and ingenious Knight, I cannot but ac|knowledge my Life and Honour to be protected by your Virtue; I &s;hall therefore in part of a Requital communicate &s;omething to you for your Advantage, which in &s;hort is this: Not far from this place there is an enchanted Ca&s;tle kept by two Ladies, at which Ca&s;tle, (if you plea&s;e to go) you

<PB REF="8">Reque&s;t; tell them that likewi&s;e you have a &s;hort Journey to take but the Hor&s;e dying in the Journey, you are now quite de|&s;titute; then they will pre&s;ently carry you into a &s;pacious Stable, where they will &s;hew you many Steeds, and bid you take your Choice; but refu&s;e them all, but one, which &s;eems to be the meane&s;t, and they will be very unwilling to lend you him: you &s;hall know him by this Sign, as &s;oon as you come into the Stable you &s;hall find him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">aid, and all the re&s;t &s;tanding, I will not now any longer detain you, leave your Hor&s;e with me till your return, and you &s;hall accompli&s;h your Bu&s;ine&s;s.

<P>How <HI>Philonzo</HI> and <HI>Cruentius</HI> came to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> Shepherd's Hou&s;e, but could not be entertained; and how they lay under an Oak that Night, and the next Morning took their Journey for <HI>Me&s;emptronia.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>PHilonzo</HI> and <HI>Cruentius</HI> being come to the Shepherd's Hou&s;e immediately alighted and knockt at the Door, but the old Shepherd and his Wife being newly gone to Bed, were very unwilling to ri&s;e; at la&s;t the Shepherd hearing them grow more violent in their Knocks, aro&s;e, and looked out of (I cannot &s;ay the Window) but out of a Hole or Cranny, and asked. Who was there; to which <HI>Philonzo</HI> replied, A couple of Pa&s;&s;engers which had lo&s;t their Way in the Wood, and by a Dog which we followed brought hither. The Shep|herd's Wife which but a little before was awaked out of her Sleep with &s;ighing for the Lo&s;s of her Dog, &s;tarts out of her Bed and cries, Oh, her dear <HI>Cut,</HI> and &s;o runs down and lets in her Dog, and after many Expre&s;&s;ions of in&s;ufferable Joy, having entertain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> her Dog with many a &s;weet Ki&s;s, &s;he went to Bed and &s;lept very heartily, whil&s;t <HI>Philonzo</HI> and <HI>Cruentius</HI> begg'd very earne&s;tly for Entertainment to protect them from a Storm, which they perceived was ha&s;tening upon them;
<PB REF="9">but all their Intreaties were in vain; for the Shepherd told them, That he and his Wife were abu&s;ed not long &s;ince by a Couple that de&s;ired to be entertained as they did, and there|fore he would not admit them by any means: At la&s;t, when they &s;aw their Intreaties were in vain, they departed, tru&s;ting them&s;elves to the Protection of an Oak, where they had not long repo&s;ed, but a great Tempe&s;t of Thunder and Lightning di&s;turbed them of their Re&s;t, &s;o that they for&s;ook the place, as deeming it dangerous to lye there in &s;uch tempe&s;tuous Wea|ther; &s;o wandring up and down all Nigt, without any Re&s;t, in the Morning they prepared for their Journey, and being at la&s;t refre&s;hed with the Heat of the Sun, they &s;purred chearful|ly along till they came within View of a (not &s;tately but) well &s;cituated Hou&s;e, not far from which, they e&s;pied a beau|tiful Lady walking &s;o &s;olitary, that &s;he hardly took notice of her own Thoughts: <HI>Philonzo</HI> riding towards her, and &s;ur|prizing her on a &s;udden, put her into &s;uch an Ama&s;ement; that for the pre&s;ent &s;he knew neithre what to do or &s;ay; but <HI>Phi</HI>-well skill'd in the Rudiments of malicious Impudence, begins to acco&s;t her in this manner:</P>
<P>Madam, quoth he, I very much commend your Choice, you have cho&s;en a plea&s;ant Morning, and a &s;weet Air for your private Meditations. Sir, replied the Lady, the Walk and the Air would be more plea&s;ant if you were further from it; I wonder a Knight, as you &s;eem to be, &s;hould be &s;o unadvi&s;ed, or rather uncivil, to intrude without Notice or Acquaintance; Sir, if you are noble, &s;hew it by your Eorbearance. to which replied <HI>Philonzo,</HI></P>
<P>Madam, had you been le&s;s Beautiful, I had been le&s;s Am|bitious; but, Madam, your Beauty is the Author of my bold Intru&s;ion, but I hope you have Goodne&s;s to pardon, as well as I have Infirmities to offend. Sir, quoth the Lady, the Vanity of Court&s;hip hath taught me to di&s;like a Courtier, I will therefore leave my Walk to your Enjoyment. Nay, quoth <HI>Philonzo,</HI> I cannot &s;o &s;uddenly di&s;mi&s;s you, for your Beau|ty
<PB REF="9">has made &s;uch a Conque&s;t of my Heart, &s;o either return what your Beauty has robb'd me of, or I mu&s;t be inforced to take it. Sir, quoth the Lady, I neither know your Intent, not Meaning, but I expect you to be civil, therefore wrong not my Expectations. At which Words, <HI>Philonzo</HI> beckoning to his Brother <HI>Cruentine</HI> that &s;tood within &s;ight, pre&s;ently with much Rigour and Incivility laid hold on her, and dragg'd her into a Forre&s;t which was within half a Mile, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his Brother <HI>Cruentine.</HI> I need not tell the Reader of the many Tears, the grievous Complaints, the &s;undry Prayers this poor di&s;te&s;&s;ed Lady made to tho&s;e inhumane Villains, but all to no purpo&s;e: For had not an unexpected Knight pa&s;&s;ed by, who hearing the Shrieks of one in Di&s;tre&s;s, boldly approached to place, where he found the&s;e Villains endeavouring to rob her of her Cha&s;tity, whom they '&s;pying, perceived him to be their Brother, which they left bound in the Wood, ran a|way, and at la&s;t arrived at <HI>Me&s;emptronia,</HI> where being come, they pre&s;ently went to to their Inn, and &s;o to Re&s;t, not at the lea&s;t troubled at their barbarous Cruelty; the next Morning approaching, they aro&s;e, and commanded a plentiful Dinner to be provided, and that &s;uch Company as the City afforded &s;hould be invited to keep them Company, being Strangers at that Time; to which their Ho&s;t, preferring his own Gain, conde&s;cended, and fore with &s;ent for a Crew of the mo&s;t no|torious Cheats the Town could afford, who plau&s;ibly treated the new come Gue&s;ts, telling them of the many Courti&s;ans the City abounded withal, which were pre&s;ently &s;ent for, and a great Banquet provided, to the Admiration of the diligent|ly joyful Ho&s;t; but after &s;ome Days of their abode they began to feel a Con&s;umption in their Pockets, which cau&s;ed them to con&s;ult of their Departure.</P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter <HI>Innocentine</HI> perceiv'd which Steed it was which the Lady advi&s;ed him to reque&s;t, he was very importunate with the Ladies to let him have that Hor&s;e which was laid; to which they replied, Alas, that was the wor&s;t in the Stable, de&s;iring him to make &s;ome other Choice; but he replied, That the other were too good and too lu&s;ty for him, in re&s;pect that he was a very bad Hor&s;eman. The Ladies &s;eeing that
<FIGURE>

</FIGURE> he would not be denied, endeavoured to enchant him, but their Enchantments could not take Effect, becau&s;e the Hermit's Sword, was a Pre&s;ervative. Thus &s;eeing all their Labour in vain, they made him &s;wear that he would return again, and he &s;hould have his De&s;ires; but to be &s;hort, having &s;wore according to their De&s;ires, the Hor&s;e was brought forth, he
<PB REF="10">leaping upon him, was on a &s;udden carried to <HI>Green Iveyland,</HI> and in his Journey overthrew many Knights which waited there to encounter any that &s;hould approach: But he with his good Sword and Steed made &s;light of 'em; then he approach|ed to the Brazen Walls, where he was welcomed with the Roaring of Lions and Dragons, but as he brandi&s;hed his Sword they fell into a dead Sleep, then <HI>Innocentine</HI> pa&s;&s;ed freely: not long after he came to a Fort which was guarded by Giants, who when they perceived his Approach, pre|&s;ently came running at him with great Violence, but he no &s;ooner brandi&s;h'd his &s;word but they fell all a&s;leep. At length, having many more Difficulties, which are now too tedious to relate, he came to the Place where the Queen and the Ea|gle was: The Queen and her Attendance beholding a Stran|ger &s;o near her Pre&s;ence, began to rebuke his In&s;olency; but he brandi&s;hing his Sword, the Queen and all her Attendance fell a&s;leep, in&s;omuch that they could not be waked; in the mean time <HI>Innocentine</HI> alighted and took the Eagle, with no &s;mall joy, and was departing, but his Hor&s;e would not by any means &s;tir a Foot from the Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, which made <HI>Innocen|tine</HI> in a doubt what to do; but beholding the incomparable Beauty of the Queen, he drew near and &s;aluted her as &s;he &s;lept, after which, <HI>Innocentine</HI> cut off a Lock of the Queen's Hair, and left a Lock of his in her Bo&s;om, and then he took a Ring of rich Value from her Finger, and put one of his in the &s;ame place; then finding her Picture about her Neck, he took that off, and &s;upplied the Place with his own. Having done the&s;e things, he writes the&s;e Lines, and pins them upon the Sleeve of her Garment:
<Q><L>Renowned Queen, what here is done,</L>
<L>Was acted by a Monarch's Son:</L>
<L>But before I could depart,</L>
<L>I took your Eagle, left my Heart:</L>
<L>Accept the Change, and pardon the Abu&s;e;</L>
<L>Virtue whilst you remain, will be in u&s;e.</L></Q>
<PB REF="11">Having thus done, he mounts his Hor&s;e with the Eagle in his Hand, and was immediately brought to the Forre&s;t where he pre&s;erved the Lady from Ravi&s;hment: His Steed making a Stand at a great River, would not go any further, notwith|&s;tanding <HI>Innocentine</HI> u&s;ed all the Skill he could with Switch and Spur, but at la&s;t his Hor&s;e &s;pake, and bid him forbear, and alight; <HI>Innocentine</HI> not a little amazed, alighted, then the Hor&s;e began to tell him, he mu&s;t chop off his Head, and throw it into that River, withal bidding him not to be afraid for he intended him no Harm; But, &s;ays he, when you have throw me in, &s;tand with your Sword by the River, and in what Shape &s;oever you &s;ee me appear, knock me down again, till I a|ri&s;e in the Shape of a Man; <HI>Innocentine</HI> being &s;omething ama|zed at this &s;udden and &s;trange Alteration, knew not for the pre&s;ent what to do, but after a little pau&s;e, he re&s;olved to do it, which being done, he threw the Head into the River, and it ro&s;e up the fir&s;t time like a Lyon, but he pre&s;ently knockt it down, then it ro&s;e up in &s;everal other Shapes, but he &s;till kept it down, but at la&s;t it aro&s;e like a tall proper Man, and then he helpt it out, which being done; the Man bid him fear nothing but follow his Advice, and give Ear to him, whil&s;t he informed him of &s;omething which might conduce to his Be|nefit: I was, &s;aith he, a Knight in that enchanted Ca&s;tle which you had me out of, and all tho&s;e fair Steeds you &s;aw, were inchanted Knights; I am likewi&s;e the Husband of that Lady you pre&s;erved from the Violence of your Brothers, which Brothers will meet with you before you come home, with full Re&s;olution to kill you; but fear not, but hide the Ring and Picture, which you had of the Queen, and de&s;ire them not to kill you, but tell them you will never di&s;cover them to your Father, then they &s;hall take away your Eagle and let you go; Thus as you have pre&s;erved me and mine, I will pre&s;erve you and yours.</P>

<P>How <HI>Philonzo</HI> and <HI>Cruentius</HI> obtained a counter|feit Eagle in the City of <HI>Me&s;emptronia,</HI> and returning home met their younger Brother <HI>Innocentine,</HI> and robb'd him of his Eagle, and what after happened.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>PHilonzo</HI> and <HI>Cruentius</HI> having &s;pent mo&s;t of their Money, at la&s;t agreed with &s;ome in the City to get them an Ea|gle; which they pretended they could do, which was not long effecting, for they got a very great Fowl, the neare&s;t they could like an Eagle, and guilded his Feathers, and brought it to them, which they with much Joy accepted, gi|ving a large Sum for it, and forthwith departed the City; but as they travelled, it was their Fortune to meet their Bro|ther <HI>Innocentine</HI> carrying an Eagle in a &s;ilver Cage, at the &s;ight whereof their Eagle trembled and dyed; but without the lea&s;t Salute to their Brother, they run upon him, and would have killed him; but he, according to his Advice had hid the Ring and Picture in a private place about him, which they di&s;cover'd not, but took away Cage and Eagle, with full intent to kill him; but he with many pa&s;&s;ionate Expre&s;&s;ions diverted their Intentions, promi&s;ing them to become their Servant, and never betray them to his Father: they hearing the&s;e Promi&s;es, &s;aved his Life, and &s;o he became their Servant, and they journeyed together; at la&s;t coming home, and carrying their Eagle in Triumph, they were ioyfully enter|tained; the King embracing the two Elde&s;t, and command|ing the Younge&s;t to be immediately put to Death for tho&s;e Lyes which his Brothers had related of him; but <HI>Innocentine</HI> heartily begg'd of his Father that he might not be put to Death, and &s;o did his Brothers &s;eemingly, but that he might be made Inferior to the wor&s;t Servant in the Hou&s;e, to which the King, though, unwilling, agreed: Thus was poor <HI>Innocentine,</HI> that de&s;erved a ju&s;t Reward, ca&s;t out of his Father's Favour for ever. But it happened that not long after the Queen of <HI>Green Ivy-land,</HI> hearing where her Eagle
<PB REF="12">was, came with a great Train to <HI>Arragon,</HI> and pre&s;ented her&s;elf to the King, who was ab&s;olutely cured by the Vertue of the Eagle. The Queen receiving that bountiful Enter|tainment which her E&s;tate required, asked the King how ma|ny Sons he had; to which the King replied, Two; &s;he de&s;i|red &s;he might be allowed &s;o great a Favour as to &s;ee them; immediately they appeared; &s;o &s;he called <HI>Philonzo,</HI> and asked him if he was the Man that made &s;o gallant an At|tempt for her Eagle; he replied, It was his poor Endeavour that obtained it. Pray, &s;ays &s;he, let me &s;ee &s;ome A&s;&s;urance; did you leave me nothing, nor take nothing from me? No, replied <HI>Philonzo.</HI> Then, quoth the Queen, you are not the Man; after him was pre&s;ented <HI>Cruentius,</HI> whom the Queen in like manner greeted, but he replied as <HI>Philonzo</HI> did, That he took nothing from her, nor left any thing with her. The Queen concealing her Anger, told the King that the&s;e My&s;te|ries pa&s;t her Imaginations; de&s;ired the King ingeniou&s;ly to tell her if he had no more Sons. Renowned Queen, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I had another Son, which now I own not; I think he may be living among&s;t the mean Servants of my Hou&s;e, but for a Son I own him not. To which the Queen replied, &s;he mu&s;t needs &s;ee him; Alas, replied the King, I think him not worthy of my Pre&s;ence, much more of &s;o renowned a Queen as your&s;elf: but to &s;atisfie your Reque&s;ts, he &s;hall be called; in the mean time the King departed, whil&s;t <HI>Innocentine</HI> ap|proached the Queen's Pre&s;ence, to whom the Queen di&s;cours'd as follows:</P>
<P>Are you the younge&s;t Son of this Royal King, or no? he replied, with a blu&s;hing Countenance, No. What, are you his Servant? he replied, No. Friend, you &s;peak very my|&s;terou&s;ly, di&s;cover thy &s;elf. Then know, incomparable La|dy, that my Father being incens'd again&s;t me, condemn'd me to dye; but by the Reque&s;t of my Brothers I was pre&s;erved, and became a Servant to the wor&s;t of my Father's Servants, contenting my &s;elf with the&s;e poor Habiliments, which indeed were they as rich as could be imagined, were too mean to be
<PB REF="12">pre&s;ented before &s;o worthy a Per&s;on, as, Madam, you are; and for my&s;elf, I could tremble into A&s;hes at the &s;ight of &s;o excellent a Creature as your vertuous &s;elf; but I &s;hall remove &s;o unworthy an Object from your Sight, and crave Licen&s;e to depart. No, replyed the Queen, you &s;hall not; I have a few que&s;tions to ask you. My Rudene&s;s, mo&s;t unparrall'd La|dy, &s;hall be as obedient to reply, as your Grace &s;hall be ready to demand, although I am unworthy to be the lea&s;t of your Creatures. The Queen hearing him expre&s;s him&s;elf with &s;o much Humility, and Excellency of Speech, the King for|getting his Son was there, came &s;uddenly into the Pre&s;ence of Queen, and beholding his Out-ca&s;t, &s;tarted back; the Queen perceiving it, de&s;ir'd the King to yield her &s;o great a Favour as to &s;tay to hear her ask his Son two or three Que&s;tions; the King not u&s;ing to deny the Reque&s;t of &s;uch Per&s;ons, &s;ate down, whil&s;t the Queen thus expre&s;t her&s;elf to <HI>Innocentine:</HI> Was it you that took my Eagle from me, pray an&s;wer me without Ceremony? To which he bowing him&s;elf, replyed, Madam, I did. And what Token left you with me, or took from me? Madam, a Lock of your Hair. Where is it? re|plied the Queen. Next my Heart, Madam, replied <HI>Inno|centine,</HI> and here it is. But what did you leave me? &s;aid the Queen. A Lock of mine, replied <HI>Innocentine.</HI> Great Prince, (&s;aid the Queen to the King) and here it is; but pray let your Patience expect my farther Di&s;cour&s;e with him; Come hi|ther, &s;aid the Queen, to ba&s;hful <HI>Innocentine,</HI> do you know this Picture and this Ring? Yes, Madam, and I hope your Greatne&s;s knows the&s;e, (&s;hewing her the Picture and Ring which he had took from her.) Come, &s;ays the Queen, give me the Picture, and in&s;tead of the Shadow, take the Sub&s;tance; I am re&s;olved, renowned King, not to depart, till I have made him Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of all I have. Admire it not; for it is nothing but Truth.</P>
<P>The King, like a Man tran&s;ported, at fir&s;t thought the Queen to be po&s;&s;e&s;t of a Frenzy, but after more &s;erious De|bate, found all Truth which &s;he had related, and pre&s;ently
<PB REF="13">&s;ent for his two Sons, <HI>Philonzo</HI> and <HI>Cruentius,</HI> and commands their Heads to be &s;truck off; but <HI>Innocentine</HI> &s;econded with his incomperable Lady, per&s;waded his Father to &s;ave their Lives, and bani&s;h them; which the King, though unwilling|ly, con&s;ented to, after which he imbraced his Son, and told him, in Requital of his great Abu&s;es, he would &s;ettle his Kingdom upon him. The Queen joyful to &s;ee the King im|brace his Son, de&s;ired the King that hereafter he would plea&s;e to own her as his obedient Daughter.
