<HEAD TYPE="sub">Printed according to Order, <HI>September</HI> 8th. 1690.</HEAD>
<P>SInce our Gracious Kings Re&s;olution for <HI>England,</HI> great preparations were made for His Maje&s;ties &s;etting forward, who accordingly took Shiping at <HI>Waterford,</HI> and Landed on <HI>Saturday</HI> Night at <HI>Au&s;t-Ferry,</HI> Four Miles from Sir <HI>Robert Southwells,</HI> and lay at Sir <HI>Roberts</HI> that Night, and on Sunday went to the Duke of <HI>Beaufords</HI> Hou&s;e at <HI>Major-Babington</HI> in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> where he lay that Night, and this day he comes to Sir <HI>William Rich</HI>'s Hou&s;e at <HI>Sonning</HI> near <HI>Reading,</HI> and to Morrow de&s;igns to Dine at <HI>King&s;ington,</HI> whither his Royol Con&s;ort is gone to order the Affairs for his Reception, and de&s;igns to meet his Ma|je&s;ty at <HI>Hampton-Court.</HI></P>
<P>Orders were given to Relieve them at 4 in the Afternoon, being the 19th, which was accordingly done by Count <HI>Solmes,</HI> Count <HI>Na&s;&s;au,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Hanmore,</HI> who it was thought would have &s;tormed the Fort but did not, this day the Cannon on both &s;ides fired very briskly, we di&s;mounted 3 of their Guns, but all Night both &s;ides were quiet, we prepared a Battery for Six 24 pounders, which were drawn all but one and planted within a Carbine Shot of the Wall.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 20th. This Morning Early we played on the Fort with 2 Batteries, and by 3 in the Afternoon had tumbled down a good part thereof; His Maje&s;ty after Dinner went to a place near the Battery, and
<PB REF="2" MS="y">on a Signal of 3 Guns, our Granadiers being ready, each having 3 Gra|nadoes, Storm'd the Fort, and in le&s;s than half an hour were Ma&s;ters of it, putting all to the Sword they found therin, being 150. except the Officer one Captain <HI>Barret,</HI> who was brought to the Guard by his Ma|je&s;ties Order: The Enemy made a brisk Salley with Hor&s;e, they expect|ing to beat us out of our new gain'd Ground, but our Men being prepa|red to receive them &s;ent them in again quickly with great lo&s;s, for ju&s;t as they Sallied, Major General <HI>Kirk</HI> relieved our Trenches, and tho&s;e that were on before, joyned him, and gave them &s;o warm a Wel|come, being &s;econded by a Detach'd Body of 600 Hor&s;e, and a Peal or two from our Ordinance, that they ran in again. We had &s;ome Officers killed and wounded, Capt. <HI>Lucy</HI> of the Lord <HI>Oxfords</HI> Regiment Killed; Col. <HI>Bellia&s;tle</HI> (formerly Lieutenant to <HI>Callimote</HI>) Wounded; and about 100 private Soldiers Killed and Wounded; But the Enemy had at lea&s;t 500 Slain, and the Wounded we cannot learn. Capt. <HI>Needham</HI> of Lord <HI>Meathes</HI> Regiment of Granadiers (who behaved him&s;elf to admiration, as indeed did all our Officers and Soldiers) was Killed coming from the Trenches after they were relieved.</P>
<P>This morning between 3 and 4, being <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 21th, the Enemy made a brisk Sally, and <HI>Kirk</HI> who&s;e Po&s;t they Attacked) let them come up to his Trenches, and then gave them &s;uch a welcome with his &s;mall Shot, and &s;econded by our Cannon, that in le&s;s than a quarter of an hour they ran in again with a very con&s;iderable lo&s;s. This day the Enemy Fired upon us in the Fort we had gained, from a Roundal and Square To|wer which over-looked it, and fired with &s;mall Rubonetts, which galled our Men much, &s;o that this day we could do little but &s;helter our &s;elves with Fachines and other blinds, till our Works could be made to &s;ecure us better, and in making a Battery n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ar our Fort, which we compleated, and planted 4 Guns carrying 24 pounders: this Night the Enemy did not Di&s;turb us.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 22d. About 5 this Morning we battered the Roundal with our 4 Guns, and with that &s;ucce&s;s, that about 4 this Afternoon we brought it down, which covered another &s;mall Fort the Enemy had; we have &s;ince been battering the &s;quare Tower which covers their Spurr be|fore the Gate, in which we have made a con&s;iderable Breach. This day came up our great Guns from <HI>Carrick</HI> and &s;ome Mortars, and are carried down to the Battery, &s;o that I doubt not but to Morrow the Spurr Tow|er will like wi&s;e fall, and then we &s;hall &s;torm their Counter&s;carpe, which is well Palli&s;aded, they having left nothing unatempted to &s;trengthen the Town, yet nothing can &s;tand again&s;t us. This Evening his Maje&s;ty &s;ent a Drum into the Town with Offers of mercy, or el&s;e to expect nothing but Fire and Sword. His Maje&s;ty never had his health better, to whom <HI>God of his mercy continue it.</HI></P>
<P>Here has been one <HI>Cro&s;by</HI> &s;eized for having Letters &s;ent to him by P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t, which were opened at the Po&s;t Office here, and found to be of ill Con&s;e|quence; he was la&s;t Night before the Lords Commi&s;&s;ions of the Great-Seal.</P>
<P>The Almighty God has ble&s;t us as yet with fair Weather for our Camp, and I hope will continue his Mercy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> do commit great Barbarities in the We&s;t: the Papi&s;ts here were in great Con&s;ternation for fear of being generally Plundered by the Soldiers, but there ia a Proclamation out again&s;t it, which has quieted their minds till the next time.</P>
