I will not enlarge my &s;elf here upon the
&s;ingular Benefit the Government received
at that time by your Care and Vigilancy,
to your no &s;mall charge and hazard; the
publick Te&s;timonies, and reiterated Recom|mendations

the&s;e Eminent Services, you did to the

<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AMong&s;t a great many other Advan|tages,
which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation
enjoys under the Au&s;picious Reign
of His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, the In|fluence
this Crown has in Foreign Affairs, may
be look't upon as one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable,
whether in re&s;pect of the Honour, or Benefit,
which is from thence derived to the Generali|ty
of the People of <HI>England.</HI> For, whereas
our Inte&s;tine Broils, and the Carele&s;ne&s;s of the
two preceding Reigns, had render'd the Inte|re&s;t
of this I&s;land almo&s;t as much divided from
that of other States of <HI>Europe,</HI> as it is &s;epa|rated
from the Neighbouring Countries by the
Ocean, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that it is
chiefly owing to the incomparable Valour of
His pre&s;ent <HI>Britannick</HI> Maje&s;ty that the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have re-gain'd their Ancient Repu|tation
abroad; and that in &s;o eminent a De|gree,
that even the mo&s;t potent Princes, in
far di&s;tant Countries, looking upon this King|dom
<PB REF="5">
as one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in <HI>Europe,</HI>
&s;hew a more than ordinary Deference to His
Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> It is, withont
Que&s;tion, upon that Score, we have &s;een &s;o
lately one of the greate&s;t Princes in the World
leave, for &s;ome Time, his own Country, and,
maugre the Tediou&s;ne&s;s of &s;o great a Journey,
came to vi&s;it this I&s;land. As I am well a&s;|&s;ured
that this Journey of His pre&s;ent <HI>Czar|ri&s;h</HI>
Maje&s;ty is without a Parallel in the <HI>Ru&s;|&s;ian</HI>
Empire, &s;o it was that which gave the
fir&s;t Opportunity of engaging my Thoughts in
the following Treati&s;e. I was not in&s;en&s;ible
there were many Ob&s;tacles to be &s;urmounted,
in an Undertaking of this Nature: And I was
not ignorant, that the Want of Learning,
and the Natural Propen&s;ity of the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites</HI>
in general to Jealou&s;ie and Secre&s;ie,
would render it, at lea&s;t, very difficult, if
not quite impractieable, to give an exact Ac|count
of &s;o va&s;t an Empire, compo&s;ed out of
&s;everal Nations, di&s;tingui&s;hed in their Lan|guages,
Religion and Manner of Living.
The&s;e Con&s;iderations were &s;o prevailing with
me, as to check my fir&s;t Inclinations, in hopes
that &s;ome Body or another would lay hold on &s;o
favourable an Opportunity of giving a true De|&s;cription
of a Country which has been but &s;u|perficially
known hitherto in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But perceiving that no Body would venture
to engage him&s;elf in the De&s;ign, I took a
<PB REF="5">
Re&s;olution to undertake the Task, though ne|ver
&s;o difficult, rather than to let &s;lip &s;o &s;ea|&s;onable
an Opportunity, as offered it &s;elf, by
the Arrival of His pre&s;ent <HI>Czarri&s;h</HI> Maje&s;ty
in <HI>England,</HI> of giving the Publick the be&s;t
Account I could of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Empire. The
Va&s;tne&s;s of its Territories (a great many
whereof are quite unfrequented by Strangers)
did put me under an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of ha|ving
Recour&s;e to tho&s;e of &s;everal Nations in
<HI>Europe,</HI> that have had the Opportunity of
Travelling in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> For, as I was ful|ly
re&s;olved to in&s;ert nothing in this Treati&s;e,
but what I had received upon the Credlt of
tho&s;e that had been Eye-Witne&s;&s;es of their
own Relations; &s;o I was obliged to con&s;ult the
Travels, and mo&s;t e&s;pecially the Emba&s;&s;ies, of
the <HI>Engli&s;h, Germans, French, Dutch,</HI> and
other Nations, into tho&s;e Parts. And, for
as much as it is obvious, that &s;carce ever any
one Foreigner did vi&s;it one half of this &s;pa|cious
Empire, I was put under an indi&s;pen|&s;able
Nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upplying the Defects of one,
with the Relations of others, who had (accor|ding
to their &s;everal Occa&s;ions) taken different
Roads in their Travels through <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI>
But here it was, I found my &s;elf engaged in
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">he&s;e Difficulties, which were not ea&s;ie to be
&s;urmounted: For, in comparing the &s;everal
Relations of different Per&s;ons, and Nations,
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> found it a very difficult Task to reconcile,
<PB REF="6">
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the various De&s;criptions of
Places, e&s;pecially in what relates to their Si|tuations
and Di&s;tances; occa&s;ioned, doubtle&s;s,
by the mo&s;t &s;tupid Ignorance and Jealou&s;ie of
tho&s;e <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> from whom they had receiv|ed
their Intelligence. The Hi&s;tory of <HI>Mu&s;|covy</HI>
it &s;elf, even that of the la&s;t Age, is en|tangled
in &s;uch Perplexities, in point of Chro|nology,
that &s;ome of the be&s;t Hi&s;torians of our
Age (whom I will forbear to name) have
been &s;urpri&s;ed into &s;ome Mi&s;takes of this na|ture.
For the re&s;t; As the Manners and Cu|&s;toms
of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> as well as their Re|ligion
and Policy, are very different from
mo&s;t other Nations in <HI>Europe;</HI> and either
not at all, or, at lea&s;t, but &s;uperficially known
in the&s;e Parts; &s;o the en&s;uing Relation may,
in all probability, &s;erve, not only to in&s;truct,
but al&s;o to divert the curious Reader. I mu&s;t
confe&s;s, the pre&s;ent <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Empire might
well have de&s;erved a Treati&s;e &s;uitable, in
Bulk, to its va&s;t Extent: But the Eager|ne&s;s
which mo&s;t of my Friends &s;hewed in the
Publi&s;hing of it at this Sea&s;on, obliged me t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
contract it into as narrow a Compa&s;s as the
Matter would allow of: Which, as it ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">

&s;o I have been very careful in not pa&s;&s;ing b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
any thing of Moment, which I believed migh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
be material, and tend to the Satisfaction o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
the Reader. It was for this Rea&s;on al&s;o, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB REF="6">
thought it mo&s;t expedient to divide the whole
into two di&s;tinct Volumes; the fir&s;t of which
contains a De&s;cription of tho&s;e &s;everal Na|tions,
and va&s;t Territories, under the Obe|dience
of the pre&s;ent Grand <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;co|vy;</HI>
together with their Laws, Cu&s;toms,
Manner of Living, Religion, and Policy:
With an Account of the Origin of the <HI>Ru&s;|&s;ian</HI>
Empire, and its Increa&s;e, till the Death
of that famous Tyrant <HI>John Ba&s;ilovits,</HI> to|wards
the Latter End of the la&s;t Age. But
the various and mo&s;t &s;urprizing Revolutions,
which, after the Death of this Grand Tyrant,
happen'd in the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Empire, either
in Con&s;ideration of their various Vici&s;&s;itudes,
or the Strangene&s;s of their Events, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing
not only what former Ages have delivered of
this kind, but hardly to be parallell'd by Po|&s;terity,
I re&s;erved the full and exact Rela|tion
of them to the Second Volume; with a
Continuation of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Hi&s;tory, and
the whole State of Affairs, from the Year
1613, (when the Family of the pre&s;ent <HI>Czar</HI>

was the mo&s;t inhumane of all, was, that even the

given them to Fortifie them&s;elves, the Mu&s;covian
Army was in a little time reduced to that Extre|mity,
for want of Provi&s;ions, that their General
(who never &s;o much as attempted to force the <HI>Poles</HI>
out of their Po&s;ts) was forced to make a &s;hame|ful
Capitulation for him&s;elf and the whole Army,
with all the Artillery and Baggage, to Surrender at
Di&s;cretion, and to leave &s;ufficient Ho&s;tages for the
Ran&s;om of all the Officers and Soldiers, which was
accordingly paid by the Great Duke. The Gene|ral,
relying upon the Favour of the Archbi&s;hop,

to have had a hand in this Treachery, re|turn'd

the Opinion of <HI>Herodotus,</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> who af|firm,
that the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea</HI> is a particular Sea by it
&s;elf, not having any communication with other

<PB N="46" REF="31">
&s;o encompa&s;s'd with Land, that it de&s;erves the
name of the <HI>Mediteranean</HI> in a more &s;trict &s;en&s;e,

the <HI>Orxentes,</HI> near a hundred other Rivers of le&s;s

the&s;e prodigious Acce&s;&s;ions of Waters, it is not
&s;en&s;ibly increa&s;ed; which may &s;eem to furni&s;h a
probable Argument to tho&s;e, who a&s;&s;ert, that the
Waters of the&s;e Rivers mu&s;t needs be conveyed
thence by &s;ome great and con&s;iderable Pa&s;&s;ages, or
open communication with other Seas. The <HI>Per|&s;ians</HI>
are of opinion, that under the Mountains near
<HI>Ferebath,</HI> betwixt the Provinces of <HI>Tauri&s;tan</HI> and
<HI>Me&s;endan,</HI> there is a Gulph where the&s;e Waters are
&s;wallowed up, and conveyed away under the Earth.

or but &s;uperficially known to the antient <HI>Greeks</HI> and

many things, which are contradicted by Experi|ence.
What <HI>Curtius</HI> relates concerning the <HI>Ca&s;pian

it being full as Salt as the Waters of the Ocean;
<PB N="47" REF="31">
tho' upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Hyrcania</HI> (now called <HI>Kilan</HI>)
the Water is only bracki&s;h, becau&s;e of the mixture
of a great many Rivers which fall into this Sea on
that &s;ide; which may probably have led the above|mentioned
Author into that Error, tho' the &s;ame
may be ob&s;erved in the Ocean; e&s;pecially upon the
Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand,</HI> by rea&s;on of the
fre&s;h Waters of divers Rivers, which exonerate
them&s;elves thereabouts. What the &s;ame Author
relates of a va&s;t number of Serpents in this Sea, is
po&s;itively contradicted by the Inhabitants of the
Province of <HI>Kilan,</HI> and others bordering upon that
Sea: <HI>Pomponius Mela,</HI> in his Geography &s;peaks of a
va&s;t number of Mon&s;ters, which he calls <HI>Belluae,</HI>
abiding in this Sea, which he alledges for one main
Rea&s;on, why it is &s;carce Navigable; whereas it is
&s;ufficiently known, that the true Rea&s;on why the
<HI>Per&s;ians, Tartars</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> &s;eldom venture
far into this Sea, and that only in Summer, is, that
their Barks and Boats are &s;o &s;mall and wretchedly
built, that they dare not venture far from the Shoar;
Be&s;ides, that this Sea has very few Havens, to wit,
that betwixt the I&s;le of <HI>Tzenzeni</HI> and the Continent,
near <HI>Terki,</HI> beforementioned, the Havens of <HI>Baku,

the Inhabitants bordering upon it, being generally
very bad Seamen, and not well skill'd in the Com|pa&s;s,
it is their own Ignorance, and the Danger of
this Sea, that keeps them near the Shoar, not the
Terror of the&s;e Mon&s;ters; tho&s;e other <HI>Europaeans</HI>

<PB N="48" REF="32">
&s;tock'd with Inhabitants, and a great number of
Cities and Villages; The Water being of the &s;ame
colour with that of all other Seas, and there being
not one I&s;land in it, that has either City or, Village;
and, if the <HI>Per&s;ians, Tartars</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> living
thereabouts, may be believ'd, there is only the I&s;le
of <HI>En&s;il</HI> near <HI>Ferebath,</HI> which having very good
Pa&s;tures, the Neighbouring Inhabitants, who keep
their Cattle there, have a few Huts to defend them
again&s;t the Injuries of the Weather, during the
time their Cattle Gra&s;es there. Of the &s;ame &s;tamp
is what <HI>Contarinus,</HI> in his Travels, and Father <HI>Bi|zarous</HI>
in his Hi&s;tory of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> relate concerning a
certain round Fi&s;h without a Head, to be found in
this Sea, of an Ell and a half Diameter, of which,
they &s;ay, there is drawn a certain Oil, which the
<HI>Per&s;ians</HI> u&s;e in their Lamps, and to gree&s;e their Ca|mels;
whereas there are at the foot of the Moun|tain

Before we leave the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea,</HI> it will perhaps
not be ami&s;s to take notice of a certain Species of
wild Gee&s;e, or (rather Cormorants) which are
found in great numbers on that Shoar, e&s;pecially
towards the mouth of the River <HI>Wolga.</HI> They are
like other Gee&s;e as to their Colour, Legs, Neck and
Feet, but the bulk of their Bodies exceeding the
Swans. Their Bills are fork'd at the end, being a
Foot and half long, and near two Inches broad,
the whole Body of &s;ome of them being above &s;e|ven
Foot in length from the Head to the Feet. But
what is mo&s;t remarkable in them, is, that under
their Bills, they have a &s;hrivell'd Skin hanging, re|&s;embling
a Bagg, which, when dilated, contains
more or le&s;s three Gallons of Liquor, this they
make u&s;e of for a Re&s;crontory for &s;uch Fi&s;h they
take, which they afterwards &s;wallow down at

When it puts its Beak into the Water, it makes a

without doubt it had its Name. I had almo&s;t for|got

from thence to the Frontiers of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>The Country of <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia</HI> is &s;ituate all along the coa&s;t
of the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea,</HI> from the South-We&s;t to North-Ea&s;t,
encompa&s;&s;ing it about in form of a Cre&s;&s;ent,
and making a very &s;pacious Bay. The <HI>Circa&s;&s;ians</HI>
are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of that Part of <HI>Albania,</HI> which hath
for its Frontiers on the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-&s;ide the <HI>Ca&s;|pian
Sea</HI> and Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> and on the South and
North the River <HI>Bu&s;tro,</HI> and the De&s;arts of <HI>A&s;tra|chan.</HI>
Very few Hi&s;torians, whether Antient or
Modern, have made any mention of them; &s;ome
having a&s;&s;igned their Habitations beyond the Mount
<HI>Cauca&s;us,</HI> near the <HI>Euxin Sea;</HI> whereas they are
more properly to be called, the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sarmatians.</HI>
Their Capital City is <HI>Terki,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The City of <HI>Terki.</HI></NOTE> above 300 Miles from
<HI>A&s;trachan</HI> by Land, &s;ituate near three Miles from
<PB N="51" REF="33">
the Shoar of the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea,</HI> upon a &s;mall River,
called <HI>Timenski</HI> (a Branch of the great River <HI>Bu|&s;tro)</HI>
which being formerly called <HI>Terck,</HI> has given
the name to this City; it is &s;eated in a very &s;pa|cious
Plain, very fenny towards the Sea-&s;ide, un|der
43 deg. 23 min. Elev. It is in compa&s;s about
two Miles, well fortified with Ramparts and Ba|&s;tions
of Earth, after the modern Way, &s;tor'd
with Cannon, and has always a con&s;iderable Gari|&s;on
in it of <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> under the Command of a
Weywode, the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Prince, who re&s;ides here,
having 500 of them allow'd him for his Guard.
Since the Reduction of tho&s;e Parts under the obe|dience
of the <HI>Czars</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> they have put in
all Places of Strength, not only their Gari&s;ons, but
al&s;o Governours, Magi&s;trates and Prie&s;ts, for the
exerci&s;e of the Chri&s;tian Religion. Notwith&s;tand|ing
this, the <HI>Circa&s;&s;ian Tartars</HI> are Govern'd by their
own Princes, Lords and Judges, who admini&s;ter
Ju&s;tice in the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Name; and, in Matters of
Importance, not without the Pre&s;ence of the Wey|wode,
or <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Governour, being all obliged to
take the Oath of Allegiance to his <HI>Czari&s;h Maje|&s;ty.</HI>
The Men are not unlike the <HI>Nagajan Tartars,</HI>
but not &s;o broad-fac'd, their Hair is black and long,
their Complexion yellowi&s;h, they &s;have the mid&s;t
of their Heads, from the Forehead to the Neck,
leaving a &s;mall Lock at the Crown. The Women
here are excellently well &s;hap'd, have no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> only
good Lineaments in their Faces, but al&s;o of a clear
and &s;mooth Complexion, which with their black
Hair hanging down in two Tre&s;&s;es on both &s;ides of
their Faces, makes them appear very agreeable.
The <HI>Circa&s;&s;ian Tartars</HI> are le&s;s barbarous than tho&s;e
of <HI>Dage&s;than,</HI> having in &s;ome mea&s;ure abated from
their former Barbari&s;m,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Habi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the <HI>Cir|ca&s;&s;ians.</HI></NOTE> &s;ince their conver&s;ing with
Chri&s;tians. The Mens Apparel is near the &s;ame
with the <HI>Nagajans,</HI> their Caps being only &s;omething
larger, their Cloaks being likewi&s;e of coar&s;e
Cloath or Sheep-Skins, fa&s;tn'd only at the Neck
with a String, which being not large enough
<PB N="52" REF="34">
to cover the whole body, they turn it according to
the Wind and Weather. The Women wear
about their Heads a black Coif, cover'd
with a fine white Cloath ty'd under the Chin.
The Widdows have hanging in their Necks an
Ox-bladder full blown, covered with a piece of
Cotton of &s;everal colours. The Women wear all
of them, during the Summer, nothing but a Smock
of divers colours, which being cut &s;o deep before,
that one may &s;ee down below their Navels, and
their Faces being always uncovered (contrary to
the Cu&s;tom of tho&s;e Parts) this, with their good
Humour, and Familiarity they u&s;e in Conver&s;ation,
makes them very de&s;irable, notwith&s;tanding which,
they have acquired the Reputation of being very
cha&s;te, tho' they &s;eldom want Opportunity of
hornifying their husbands, it being look'd upon as
a piece of common Manners among them, in a Hu&s;|band,
to go out of the doors, as &s;oon as any body
comes to &s;peak with his Wife; &s;o, that, whether
this Continency of theirs be founded upon their
own Genero&s;ity to recompence their Husbands for
the Confidence they put in them, or more upon
Fame than real Truth, we will not pretend to de|termine
in this Place. Their Language they have
common with the other Neighbouring <HI>Tartars,</HI> tho'
the chief among them are al&s;o not ignorant of the
<HI>Mu&s;covian.</HI> They are Pagans; for, tho' the Cere|mony
of Circumci&s;ion is received among them,
yet have they neither Prie&s;ts, <HI>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">choran,</HI> or Churches,
like other <HI>Mahometans;</HI> Every one here offers his
own Sacrifice at plea&s;ure, for which they have &s;ome
certain Days, e&s;tabli&s;hed rather by Cu&s;tom, than
any po&s;itive Commands. The mo&s;t Solemn Sacri|fices
they offer at the Death of their neare&s;t Friends,
e&s;pecially if they be of an Eminent Rank among
them. Upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion, both Men and Wo|men
meet in the Field, to be pre&s;ent at the per|formance
of the Sacrifice, which is a He-Goat. The
fir&s;t thing they do, is, to cut off its Privy Members,
which they ca&s;t again&s;t a Wall, and if they &s;tick
<PB N="53" REF="34">
again&s;t it, the Goat is judged fit to Sacrifice, if not,
they are obliged to kill another, till &s;uch time they
are &s;atisfied in its fitne&s;s by the before-mentioned
Tryal; Then they proceed with the Ceremonies,
fleaing it, and &s;tretching the Skin with the Head
and Horns on, upon a Cro&s;s on the top of a long
Pole, planted commonly in a Quick-&s;et <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">edge, to
keep the Cattle from it. Near this the Sacrifice is
offered, by boyling and roa&s;ting the Fle&s;h, which
they afterwards eat. The Fea&s;t being over, the
Men ri&s;e, and after having adored the Skin, and
muttered out certain Prayers, the Women with|draw,
and the Men conclude the whole with drink|ing
good &s;tore of <HI>Aqua-vitae,</HI> generally to that de|gree,
that they &s;eldom part without being as drunk
as Bea&s;ts, and &s;ometimes not without fighting.
They are very Ceremonious in their Burials, and
adorn their Sepulchres with Pillars. Over tho&s;e of
Per&s;ons of Quality they build certain little Hou&s;es,
but only of Wood, the Boards whereof are com|monly
painted of &s;everal colours, and placed Che|quer-wi&s;e,
upon the Roof of which are to be &s;een
&s;ome Statues, but very mean, and &s;ometime &s;ome
Pictures, poorly done, repre&s;enting commonly the
Hunting of &s;ome Wild Bea&s;t or another.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Dage&s;than</HI> inhabit now adays that

Kindne&s;s, which Ladies, tho' never &s;o de&s;irous of,
&s;eldom care to beg. They inhabit a Tract of

Frontier-Town of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> on that &s;ide, extending
Northward as far as to the River <HI>Bu&s;tro</HI> near the
City of <HI>Terki,</HI> the Capital of <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia.</HI> They are
called <HI>Dage&s;than,</HI> or Mountain <HI>Tartars,</HI> from the
Word <HI>Dag,</HI> which &s;ignifies in their Language as
much as a Mountain; becau&s;e they live between the

Complexion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Shape</NOTE> enclining to black; they are very
&s;trong, and well-&s;et in their Limbs, but very ugly
in their Faces, having long black Hair hanging
down over their Shoulders. The Women wear
the Hair ty'd up in a great many Tre&s;&s;es, which
hang down about their Heads, much after the man|ner
of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> but are not kept &s;o much under
Re&s;traint, having their Faces uncovered, and not
being &s;hy of being &s;een by Strangers. Tho&s;e who
live towards the Northern part of this Province,
are called <HI>Kaitack,</HI> as tho&s;e that inhabit the more

<P>Their Form of Government is that which is mo&s;t

with tho&s;e, which in very Antient Times were
e&s;tabli&s;hed in the We&s;tern Parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> For,
the whole Country is divided into a great many
Petty Lord&s;hips, each of them under the Juri&s;di|ction
of its proper Lord or Myr&s;a, who, tho' He|reditary,
is neverthele&s;s not Ab&s;olute, but his Au|thority
controuled by that of &s;ome of the chief
Men among them. All the&s;e Petty Lords acknow|ledge
one, whom they call <HI>Schemkal,</HI> for their Su|pream
Head. He &s;ucceeds not by Inheritance, but
by Election. For, after the Death of a <HI>Schemkal,</HI>
all the&s;e Petty Lords or Myr&s;a's meet, and being
&s;et down in a Ring, one of their Prie&s;ts ca&s;ts a
Golden Apple among them, the fir&s;t Per&s;on which
is touch'd by this Apple, is their <HI>Schemkal,</HI> to whom,
by common con&s;ent, they pay their Re&s;pect, but
no ab&s;olute Obedience. They are generally very
Barbarous, Savage, and Mi&s;chievous, living mo&s;t
upon Robberies, and exacting Contributions from
the Caravans that pa&s;s that way from <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> A
great part of their Livelihood is, for the Men to
&s;teal Children, not &s;paring even their neare&s;t Re|lations,
whom they &s;ell to the Neighbouring <HI>Per|&s;ians,</HI>
leaving the care of their Cattle to their Wives.

They have an odd Cu&s;tom at their Weddings; to
wit, for every Man there pre&s;ent to &s;hoot his Arrow
into the Floor, where they are left, till they are
rotten, or fall of them&s;elves. They are all <HI>Ma|hometans,</HI>
u&s;ing Circumci&s;ion, and all other Cere|monies

<P>Their Cloathing is a long clo&s;e Coat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ha|bit.</NOTE> commonly

<P>The Metropolis of the whole Country is the City
of <HI>Tarku,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tarku.</NOTE> &s;ituated within the Mountain among
&s;teepy Rocks, which are as hard as Flint, and afford
&s;everal mo&s;t plea&s;ant Springs to the City, which
contains about 1200 Hou&s;es, built of Brick-&s;tone
bak'd in the Sun, after the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> manner, but not
&s;o high; It is the Re&s;idence of one of their Petty
Princes, but is not &s;urrounded with any Fortifica|tions,
not &s;o much as a Wall. Next to this, the
mo&s;t frequented places of this Country are <HI>Ru&s;tain,
Boinack,</HI> and <HI>Andre,</HI> being three &s;everal Principa|lities,
lying in the Road betwixt <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and the Ri|ver
<HI>Wolga.</HI> The Town of <HI>Boinack</HI> is &s;ituate upon
the a&s;cent of a &s;teepy Hill near the Sea-&s;ide. That
of <HI>Andre</HI> is built upon a ri&s;ing Ground near the
River <HI>Koi&s;u</HI> (by <HI>Ptolomy</HI> call'd <HI>Albanus)</HI> which ri|&s;es
out of Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us;</HI> Its Waters are very
muddy, and its Current very &s;wift. The mo&s;t
Remarkable thing here is a certaing Spring of &s;eeth|ing
Water, which ari&s;ing near the Town, and fal|ling
at &s;ome di&s;tance into a Pool, makes the Water
fit for Bathing. About &s;ome Miles lower, the Ri|ver
<HI>Koi&s;u</HI> lets out a Branch, by the Inhabitants cal|led
<HI>Askai</HI> (probably the River <HI>Cae&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Ptolomy)</HI>
which running with a very &s;low Current, at la&s;t is
<PB N="56" REF="36">
reunited with the &s;aid River near the Sea. The
River <HI>Bu&s;tro,</HI> mentioned in the beginning of this
Chapter, (known by the name of <HI>Gerrus</HI> in <HI>Ptolomy)</HI>
is the Boundary betwixt the <HI>Circa&s;&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Dage&s;t|han
Tartars;</HI> And, about 25 Miles before its en|trance
into the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea,</HI> is divided into two
Branches, the fir&s;t of which, being called <HI>Terck,</HI> or
<HI>Timenski,</HI> has given the Name to the City of <HI>Terki,</HI>
the Metropolis of <HI>Circa&s;&s;ia.</HI> The &s;econd Branch is
called <HI>Ki&s;elar,</HI> very near as b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oad as the other, but
not &s;o deep, being fordable for the mo&s;t part of the
Summer. But before we leave the Frontiers of the
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Empire on this &s;ide, it may perhaps not be
beyond our &s;cope, to in&s;ert here &s;hort De&s;cription
of the City of <HI>Derbent,</HI> both for its Antiquity's-&s;ake,
and its being the Frontier-Town of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI>
upon the Confines of the <HI>Dage&s;than Tartars,</HI> e&s;pe|cially
&s;ince we intend to treat of &s;ome other Parts,
bordering upon <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> in the next following
Chapters.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Derbent</HI> is &s;ituate in the Province,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Derbent.</NOTE>
called by the <HI>Per&s;ians Lengerkunan,</HI> upon the very
Shoar of the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea,</HI> which &s;ometimes wa&s;hes
its Walls, under the 41 degr. 51 min. of Latitude.
Its length reaches from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, near five
Miles, but its breadth is not proportionable to its
length. It is not only the Frontier-place of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI>
lying upon its utmo&s;t Confines on this &s;ide, but
may well be called the Gate of it, reaching from
the Mountain quite down to the Sea-&s;hoar. The
whole City is divided into three di&s;tinct Quarters;
The fir&s;t, is the Mid-City, which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> af|firm
to be built by <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> as al&s;o that
Wall which &s;urrounds the City on the South-&s;ide.
The&s;e Walls are of a great height, and about &s;ix
Foot broad, and at a di&s;tance appear as if they were
built of the be&s;t Free-&s;tone in the World; but, ac|cording
to the Relation of the Inhabitants, the
Stones of it are made of Mu&s;&s;le-&s;hells and &s;mall
pieces of Free-&s;tone, beaten and molded together
into Bricks, which, by the long tract of Time, are
<PB N="57" REF="36">
reduced to that degree of hardne&s;s, as to exceed
Marble it &s;elf. There is, even to this day, up|on
one of the Gates, remaining an In&s;cription, re|&s;embling
the <HI>Syriack&punc;</HI> Character, as there appears in
another Place &s;ome <HI>Arabick</HI> words, but &s;o defaced
by length of Time, as not to be legible. The Ca&s;tle,
which lies upon the top of the Mountain, is al&s;o
related to owe its Foundation to that Great Con|querour,
and is now always kept by a very good
Garri&s;on of <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> The &s;econd Quarter reaches
up to the foot of the Mountain, being the mo&s;t
Populous, as the lower Town, which reaches to the
Sea-&s;ide, is not much frequented now, being formerly
inhabited by <HI>Greeks,</HI> but, ever &s;ince the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> re|gain'd
it from <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperor, con|verted
into Gardens. The whole Body of the City
is encompa&s;s'd with a very &s;trong Wall, &s;o broad,
that a Waggon may drive on them without Incon|venience.
The Inhabitants are all <HI>Mahometans,</HI>
except &s;ome <HI>Jews,</HI> who&s;e chief Bu&s;ine&s;s is to buy
&s;uch &s;toln Children as the Neighbouring <HI>Dage&s;than
Tartars</HI> bring thither, or el&s;e &s;ome <HI>Turks</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;|covites,</HI>
which they having pick'd up in &s;ome En|counters,
they &s;end thither to Market, to be from
thence further carried into <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> The Mountain a|bove
the City, being for the mo&s;t part covered with
Wood, affords another piece of Antiquity, to wit,
the Ruins of a Wall, which, if the Inhabitants
may be believed, formerly &s;erved for a Com|munication
betwixt the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> and <HI>Euxin</HI> Seas,
and extended it &s;elf near 300 Miles in length.
Thus much is ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tain, that in the Ruins ap|pear
now in &s;ome places &s;ix foot high, in &s;ome
others two or three, the Tract being quite lo&s;t in
others; And, on &s;ome of the adjacent Hills are to
be &s;een the Ruins of &s;everal old Ca&s;tles of a four

to this day, and are Gari&s;on'd by the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI>
There is a remarkable Monument of another kind
near this City, to wit, the Sepulchre of <HI>Tzumtzume,</HI>
of whom the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> relate the following Fable
<PB N="58" REF="37">
out of their Poet, <HI>Fie&s;ull:</HI> They relate, that <HI>E&s;&s;i</HI>
(this being the Name they give to our Saviour)
coming into tho&s;e Parts, found thereabouts a cer|tain
Dead Man's Skul, which having taken par|ticular
Notice of, he de&s;ired of God, who&s;e Fa|vourite
he was, to bring the decea&s;ed Per&s;on to
Life again; which being done accordingly, <HI>E&s;&s;i</HI>
then asked him, who he was; he an&s;wered, that
his Name was <HI>Tzumtzume,</HI> that he had been the
mo&s;t Powerful King of that Country, where he
had kept a va&s;t Court, compo&s;ed of a great many
Thou&s;ands Mu&s;icians, Pages, and other Servants.
At la&s;t <HI>Tzumtzume,</HI> having asked <HI>E&s;&s;i,</HI> who he was,
and what Religion he profe&s;&s;ed, Chri&s;t made an|&s;wer,
I am <HI>E&s;&s;i,</HI> and by the Religion I profe&s;s, all
the World is to be &s;aved. If this be true, reply'd
<HI>Tzumtzume,</HI> I declare my &s;elf for that Religion,
but de&s;ire that I may die immediately, being un|willing
to live now without Subjects in a place
where I was &s;o powerful before. <HI>E&s;&s;i</HI> having
granted his Reque&s;t, he died in&s;tantly, and his Se|pulchre
remains here to be &s;een to this day, un|der
a Tree of an extraordinary bigne&s;s, next ad|joyning
to which is a Scaffold erected of ten Foot
high, and &s;ixteen Square. On the other &s;ide of the
City are to be &s;een &s;ome Thou&s;ands of Tombs,
cover'd with Stones, half round, Cylinder-wi&s;e,
but exceeding the ordinary Stature of Men, have|ing
all of them <HI>Arabick</HI> In&s;criptions. It is report|ed,
that in former Ages, yet &s;ince the Time of
<HI>Mahomet,</HI> there was a certain King in <HI>Media,</HI>
named <HI>Ka&s;&s;an,</HI> who being engag'd in War again&s;t
the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Dage&s;than,</HI> received there a &s;ignal
Overthrow, and cau&s;ed the Bodies of the Officers
killed in this Battle to be buried in the&s;e Tombs.
The Relation &s;eems to be not altogether fictitious,
there being near the Sea-&s;ide, at &s;ome di&s;tance from
the re&s;t, forty others, exceeding the before-men|tioned
Tombs in bigne&s;s, and encompa&s;s'd with a
Wall, which having each its Banner, are &s;aid to be
the Sepulchres of &s;o many Lords of the fir&s;t Rank,
<PB N="59" REF="37">
and other Holy Men, that came along with them,
where the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> of both Sexes come
to pay their Devotions by ki&s;&s;ing the&s;e Sepulchres,
and laying their Hands upon them, while they are
at Prayers. But it is time to return to the <HI>Tarta|rians,</HI>
under the Grand Czar's Obedience, and a|mong
them, to &s;ay &s;omething of the Province of
<HI>Siberia.</HI></P>
<P>This Province which lies quite Northward from
<HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Siberia.</NOTE> betwixt the Provinces of <HI>Obdora</HI> and <HI>Ju|goria,</HI>
bordering towards the North upon the <HI>Sa|mojedes,</HI>
is of a great extent, but not very popu|lous,
being inhabited by <HI>Tartars.</HI> Its Capital City,
being al&s;o the Seat of an Archbi&s;hop, is <HI>Tobol,</HI>
built upon a ri&s;ing Ground, near a &s;mall River;
and, except &s;ome <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> inhabited by <HI>Tartars.</HI>
On the Frontiers of the <HI>Calmuck Tartars,</HI> is the Ci|ty

the chief place of Commerce in the whole Pro|vince
for Sables, and other &s;orts of Firrs, the Pro|ducts
of this Country. The Natives are a poor
and wretched &s;ort of People, notwith&s;tanding that
they have in &s;ome Parts good Corn Fields, and
great Store of Fi&s;h. But the chief and mo&s;t pre|cious
Commodity of this Country, be&s;ides other
Furrs, are the Skins of Sables. The&s;e Animals they
catch either with Traps, not unlike to tho&s;e we
catch our Rats with; or by &s;preading of Nets un|der
the Trees, where they feed, which being cut
down, they are entangled in the Nets; In the
Winter they have al&s;o a Way of hunting them
with Dogs. They were formerly Pagans, being
Govern'd by their own Czar or King, till near 150
Years ago, they were &s;ubdu'd by Czar <HI>Jobn Ba&s;ilo|vits</HI>
in the following manner: A certain Famous
Pirate among the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> living near the River
<HI>Wolga,</HI> who&s;e Name was <HI>Jormack Timorhof,</HI> having
taken a Ship loaden with Amunition, and belong|ing
to the <HI>Czar,</HI> was for fear of being pur&s;ued and
di&s;covered, fled for Shelter into a certain I&s;land,
near the River <HI>Kama,</HI> which coming from <HI>Permia</HI>
<PB N="60" REF="38">
(one of the Northern Provinces of <HI>Mu&s;covy)</HI> falls
below <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> into the River <HI>Wolga.</HI> This I&s;land
belonging then to a certain <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Merchant,
he propo&s;ed to him no le&s;s than the Conque&s;t of
&s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>Tartarian</HI> Countreys, lying more to|wards
the North; and being furni&s;hed by him with
Arms, Ammunition, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, he, with
about five or &s;ix hundred of his Followers went up
the River <HI>Tagit,</HI> and from thence to the River <HI>Tu|ra,</HI>
where having po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of a &s;mall I|&s;land,
called <HI>Japouchin,</HI> he march'd from thence to
the City of <HI>Tumen,</HI> which he al&s;o took without
much oppo&s;ition. Being flu&s;h'd with this Succe&s;s,
he directed his March &s;treight ways to <HI>Tobol,</HI> the
M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tropolis of the Province, and then the Re&s;i|dence
of the <HI>Siberian</HI> King, where having al&s;o met
with very little Re&s;i&s;tance, he &s;oon became Ma&s;ter
of the Place: But being not contented with thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
extraordinary Succe&s;s, and propo&s;ing to him&s;elf no
le&s;s than the Conque&s;t of the whole Province, he
lo&s;t &s;oon after both his Life and Conque&s;ts. For,
having pur&s;ued the flying Enemy a great way be|yond
the City of <HI>Tobol,</HI> all along the River <HI>Irti&s;h,
300</HI> of his Men, whom he had &s;ent out on purpo&s;e,
to Atrack the Enemy at a certain pa&s;s, being drawn
into an Ambu&s;h, were all kill'd upon the Spot, &s;o,
that <HI>Jormack</HI> with the re&s;t, being about 200, was
forced to retire into a &s;mall I&s;land there abouts,
where he Entrench'd him&s;elf as well as he could.
But the <HI>Tartars</HI> having by their late Victory, got
new Courage, and being informed of what num|ber
of Men he had with him, Attack'd him
by Night, where he with all his Followers, except
40, who found means to get into <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> were
either drowned or cut to pieces. The remnants of
<HI>Jormack</HI>'s Party, being at la&s;t come to the City of
<HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> and having given to the Czar a relation of
what had pa&s;t in <HI>Siberia,</HI> it was thought advi&s;able
to give them &s;ome Forces, thereby to enable them
to try their Fortune a &s;econd time. Having there|fore
obtained 600 Men, with Amunition, and other
<PB N="61" REF="38" MS="y">
Nece&s;&s;aries &s;uitable to &s;uch an Expedition, they
marched directly towards the City of <HI>Tobol,</HI> the
Metropolis and Re&s;idence of the Prince of <HI>Siberia;</HI>
and having a &s;econd time po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them&s;elves of it
without much oppo&s;ition, they took quite other
mea&s;ures to &s;ecure their Conque&s;ts, from what <HI>Jor|mack</HI>
had done before; for they &s;o &s;trongly fortified
them&s;elves there, that they &s;oon were beyond all
apprehen&s;ion of being Attack'd by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and
being afterwards reinforced with new Supplies of
Men, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, by their frequent
Incur&s;ions &s;o fatigu'd the Neighbouring <HI>Tartars,</HI>
that they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;ubmit them&s;elves under
the Czar's Protection; tho' it is not altogether im|probable,
but that the Nece&s;&s;ity of vending their
Sables and other Furrs to the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> might be
their Chief Motive of &s;urrendring them&s;elves un|der
the <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>'s Subjection. Since which
time, the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> have built in the&s;e Parts &s;e|veral

<P>Since the Conque&s;t of <HI>Siberia,</HI> it is chiefly to the
<HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> we are beholding for the particular
Di&s;covery they have made of that va&s;t Extent of
the Northern Countreys, that lie betwixt the Ri|ver
<HI>Oby</HI> (which traver&s;es this Province, and has
been mentioned before) and the Famous <HI>Chine&s;e</HI>

been made &s;en&s;ible of the prodigious Quantities of
all Sorts of precious Furrs, as the Sables, Martins and
black Foxes tho&s;e Countreys afforded, and the va&s;t
Profit that mu&s;t needs ari&s;e to their own Country,
by engro&s;&s;ing the Traffick of tho&s;e Commodities,
have left no &s;tone unturn'd, not only to make the
be&s;t Di&s;covery they could of tho&s;e <HI>Tartarian</HI> Na|tions,
but al&s;o by &s;ettling a fair Corre&s;pondence

into <HI>China.</HI> Among the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Nations which

<HI>Bogdoi,</HI> are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, whether for the
extent of the Countreys they inhabit, or the pro|digious
number of their Inhabitants. The fir&s;t
di&s;covery of the&s;e Parts has chiefly been owing to
the Indu&s;try of tho&s;e employed by the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI>
in Sable Hunting, whom they in their Language
call <HI>Yachutehiki,</HI> or <HI>Hunters of Sable Martins;</HI> The&s;e

Malefactors or Criminals, but al&s;o out of &s;ome
Officers or Boyars, who for &s;ome rea&s;on or another,
having fall'n under the <HI>Grand Czar</HI>'s Di&s;plea&s;ure, and
being bani&s;hed into tho&s;e places where the&s;e Crea|tures
are caught, the hopes of Gains has by degrees
drawn them further and further after the Search of
the&s;e Creatures, even as far as the River <HI>Yamour,</HI>
where, for their better Conveniency, the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI>
not many years ago, have built a Fort in a certain
I&s;land of that River, which has occa&s;ioned no &s;mall
Conte&s;ts betwixt them and the <HI>Chine&s;e.</HI> Be&s;ides
the two ways of catching the&s;e Creatures by the
Trap and Net, mentioned before, they ob&s;erve this
Method in the&s;e remote Parts: There is a certain
number of Men Arm'd with Cro&s;s-bows, engag'd
for this Service, during the &s;pace of &s;even Years,
and divided under certain Officers; One of the&s;e
Officers goes abroad, at lea&s;t once a Week with his
Hunters and Dogs in Search after the&s;e precious
Creatures, which commonly are lurking among the
little I&s;lands, which they kill with their Cro&s;s-Bows,
not making u&s;e of any Fire-arms, for fear
of endamaging the Furrs; What is thus caught is all
for the <HI>Czar</HI>'s U&s;e, except a certain Allowance,
the Officers have for their Pains, which however,
they are obliged to divide in proportion with their
Hunt&s;men, to encourage them in pro&s;ecuting the
Game with the utmo&s;t diligence; The eagerne&s;s

enough to curb the In&s;olency of the&s;e Vagabonds,
if it were not out of a con&s;ideration of the Bene|fit

Veneration the&s;e Pagans have for the <HI>Dala&egrave;-Lama,</HI>
is, that they have been per&s;uaded into a Belief,
that he is immortal, and only renews, like the

<P>I cannot but take notice here of the Opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pre&s;te Jean.</NOTE>
which &s;ome, that have of late years travell'd into

to wit, That he is that &s;ame <HI>Pre&s;te Jean,</HI> who has
made &s;o much noi&s;e in the World, and has been
&s;o variou&s;ly repre&s;ented by Hi&s;torians. Thus much
is certain, that if every thing be duely weighed as
it ought to be, concerning the Title and other
Things, which by many Authors are attributed to
their <HI>Pre&s;te Jean,</HI> the &s;ame may in mo&s;t points be
&s;aid of this <HI>Dala&egrave;-Lama;</HI> &s;o, that I &s;ee no rea&s;on
why we may not with more Ju&s;tice place him in
<HI>A&s;ia,</HI> than the&s;e Authors have look<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d for him in <HI>A|by&s;&s;ina,</HI>
where, with all their Endeavours and Shifts,
they have never been able to find him out hitherto.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="41">
The <HI>Portuge&s;es</HI> were the fir&s;t that received, and
afterwards communicated this erroneous Opi|nion
to the re&s;t of <HI>Europe;</HI> it being certain,
that the more an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ient Authors, who have made
any mention of this <HI>Pre&s;te Jean,</HI> have placed him
always in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> though they have differed both
as to his Name, and place of Re&s;idence.
And thus far <HI>Baltazar Tellez, Nicolas Godigno,</HI> and
&s;ome others, who have been for a con&s;iderable time
re&s;ident in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> and con&s;equently had the bet|ter
Opportunity to be inform'd concerning this
Matter, agree with the Antients, that this <HI>Pre&s;te
Jeen</HI> is not to be heard of in tho&s;e Parts. The <HI>Por|tuge&s;es</HI>
were fir&s;t led into this Error by one <HI>Pieter
de Coulan,</HI> who being &s;ent by their King <HI>John</HI> II. to
di&s;cover the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> by Land, after having tra|ver&s;ed
a great part of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> could
not hear the lea&s;t Tidings there of this &s;o Famous
<HI>Pre&s;te Jean;</HI> But, in his return homeward, com|ing

was a very Potent Prince, who was a declared Pro|tector
of the Chri&s;tians, having always a Cro&s;s car|ried
before him. This Relation agreeing in a great
mea&s;ure with what had been publi&s;hed before con|cerning
<HI>Pre&s;te Jean,</HI> was the &s;ooner received as
Authentick, fir&s;t, in <HI>Portugal,</HI> and afterwards all
over <HI>Europe.</HI> The Je&s;uit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>Kirker,</HI> has &s;hewn us
out of the <HI>Latin Chronology&punc;</HI> of the Kings of <HI>Aby&s;|&s;ina,</HI>
That there is not the lea&s;t mention made there
of this <HI>Pre&s;te Jean;</HI> and if we &s;earch narrowly in|to
the Antient Authors, that have had occa&s;ion to
&s;peak <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> him, we &s;hall find that the greate&s;t part
of them have placed him betwixt the Country of
the <HI>Monguls</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> tho' perhaps in &s;everal Pro|vinces;
which difference might perhaps ari&s;e from
thence, that in former Ages this <HI>Pre&s;te Jean</HI> had
his &s;everal Vicars, as the <HI>Dala&egrave;-Lama</HI> has now,
which might be taken by &s;ome for the Head it &s;elf.
St. <HI>Antonius,</HI> in the third Tome of his Hi&s;tory, places
this <HI>Pre&s;te Jean</HI> in the <HI>Greater</HI> or <HI>&V;pper India,</HI> from
whence, he &s;ays, he drove back the <HI>Tartars,</HI> that
<PB N="67" REF="41">
invaded the Chri&s;tians in tho&s;e Parts. Tho&s;e who
have a&s;&s;ign'd him his Reign in <HI>Kitay,</HI> have que&s;tion|le&s;s
comprehended that va&s;t Country, &s;ituate betwixt
the Rivers of <HI>Volga</HI> and the <HI>Oby,</HI> as far as <HI>China,</HI>
under that Name, as the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> do to this day;
e&s;pecially &s;ince <HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus,</HI> who re&s;ided
&s;everal Years with the <HI>Great Chan</HI> of the <HI>Tartars,</HI>
places <HI>Pre&s;te Jean</HI> in the &s;ame Kingdom of <HI>Tanchut,</HI>
where the <HI>Dala&egrave;-Lama</HI> has his Re&s;idence to this
day. Both the Antient and Modern Authors have
been &s;trangely puzzled in finding out the true Ety|mology
of the Word <HI>Pre&s;te Jean,</HI> but in my Opi|nion,
that of <HI>Scaliger</HI> is the mo&s;t probable, who
derives it from the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Word <HI>Pre&s;tegiani,</HI> which
&s;ignifies as much as <HI>Apo&s;tolick,</HI> and might ea&s;ily by
Corruption be transformed into <HI>Pre&s;te Jean</HI> by &s;uch
of the <HI>Europaeans,</HI> as did not under&s;tand its true &s;ig|nification.
There is but two Objections of any
moment to be made again&s;t this A&s;&s;ertion: The
fir&s;t is, that the &s;ame <HI>Pre&s;te Jean,</HI> who is &s;o much
celebrated throughout <HI>Europe,</HI> and his Subjects,
were Chri&s;tians; whereas the People Inhabiting now
adays the <HI>Great Tartary,</HI> are Idolaters; The &s;econd
is, that <HI>Pre&s;te Jean</HI> was a Temporal Prince. As to
the fir&s;t, it is to be ob&s;erved, that, tho' at pre&s;ent
that va&s;t Country is altogether po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by Infidels
or Pagans, neverthele&s;s it is very probable, that
in more Antient Times, the Chri&s;tian Religion
was introduced into tho&s;e Parts as well as others,
and continued there for a con&s;iderable time, there
being certain Remnants of Chri&s;tianity to be met
with to this day, among &s;ome of its Inhabitants.
There is a Country in tho&s;e Parts, called by the
<HI>Moors</HI> in deri&s;ion, <HI>Kiafer&s;tan,</HI> that is, <HI>The Country
of the Infidels,</HI> the Inhabitants of which are called
to this day, <HI>Chri&s;tians of</HI> St. <HI>Thomas;</HI> and, tho' no Chri|&s;tians
now, yet have retain'd Bapti&s;m for their Chil|dren,
have painted Cro&s;&s;es in their Churches, and
bear three Red Cro&s;&s;es, made with the Tincture of
Sanders-Wood, in their Foreheads. I think it is
almo&s;t beyond que&s;tion, that in the thirteenth Age,
<PB N="68" REF="42">
there was a va&s;t number of Chri&s;tians in <HI>Tartary,</HI>
their Emperor <HI>Cublai,</HI> having embraced the Chri&s;tian
Religion, and his Brother waged War with great
Succe&s;s again&s;t the <HI>Caliph</HI> of <HI>Babylon</HI> and other In|fidels.
In the fourteenth Age &s;everal of <HI>Franci&s;can</HI>
Monks, who were &s;ent to the Great <HI>Chan,</HI> conver|ted
in the Kingdom of <HI>Thibet</HI> (which is next to
that of <HI>Tanchut)</HI> a great number of Pagans; and
it is Remarkable, what F. <HI>Andrada,</HI> a <HI>Portuge&s;e</HI>
Je&s;uit relates, That in the Year 1624. when he tra|vell'd
in tho&s;e Parts, he found among the Inhabi|tants
&s;ome corrupted Idea's of Chri&s;tianity; as a
certain &s;ort of Confe&s;&s;ion of that Chri&s;tian Faith,
their Ance&s;tors had profe&s;s'd in former Ages. And
I think it no le&s;s worth Ob&s;ervation, that this <HI>Dala&egrave;</HI>
or High-Prie&s;t of the <HI>Tartarian,</HI> bears the Name
of <HI>Lama,</HI> which in the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Language &s;igni|fies
a Cro&s;s, and that the <HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Bogdoi,</HI> who
acknowledge among the re&s;t the Authority of this
<HI>Dala&egrave;,</HI> wear always Cro&s;&s;es about them, which they
call <HI>Lama's,</HI> and keep them with a great deal of
Reverence. As to the &s;econd Objection, of this
<HI>Dala&egrave;</HI> not being a Temporal Prince now, this may
be a&s;cribed to the Wars and Revolutions of a Coun|try
inhabited by &s;everal di&s;tinct Nations, &s;o as be|ing
fir&s;t corrupted, and at la&s;t quite degenerated
from their Antient Religion into a Barbarous Ido|latry,
and thereby the whole face of Affairs changed;
this Succe&s;&s;or of <HI>Pre&s;te Jean,</HI> from being a Monarch,
might become the Head of a New Religion, or
rather Idolatry.</P>
<P>But,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tartars of Mongul.</NOTE> it is time, after this Digre&s;&s;ion, to proceed
in the De&s;cription of the <HI>Tartarian</HI> Provinces be|tween
<HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> and among them to the
<HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Mongul.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Tartars</HI> inhabit a very
large Tract of Ground from the We&s;tern &s;ources
of the River <HI>Yamour</HI> to the <HI>Calmuck Tartars,</HI> from
whom they are however &s;eparated by great De&s;arts,
and border to the South-Ea&s;t and Ea&s;t upon <HI>Tur|que&s;tan</HI>
and <HI>China.</HI> They are &s;ubdivided into three
great Provinces, each of them being under the Ju|ri&s;diction
<PB N="69" REF="42">
of its particular <HI>Chan</HI> or <HI>Tai&s;o,</HI> who are
all three of the &s;ame Family, and cultivate a very
good Under&s;tanding betwixt one another, having
&s;everal Under-<HI>Chans</HI> under their Juri&s;diction. The
fir&s;t and chiefe&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Chans</HI> is call'd <HI>Tchetchinga,</HI>
his Territories lie betwixt <HI>China</HI> and the <HI>Tartars</HI> of
<HI>Bogdoi.</HI> They inhabit neither Towns nor Villages,
their Hou&s;es, which are but few in number, lying
&s;cattered here and there, without any regularity.
They are very trouble&s;om to their Neighbours in|habiting
about the Lake <HI>Dalai,</HI> and all along the
River <HI>Szelinga;</HI> one of their Under-<HI>Chans,</HI> call'd
<HI>Becroe&s;ain,</HI> Territories bordering upon that River.
It is in the Territories of this <HI>Chan Tchetchinga,</HI> that
the <HI>Coutou&s;ta Lama,</HI> or the Vicar of the <HI>Dala&egrave; Lama,</HI>
has his Re&s;idence, being re&s;pected here as the Pa|triarch
of all the <HI>Monguls,</HI> and adored almo&s;t like
a Deity. He follows them where-ever they ramble,
and it is to him they refer the deci&s;ion of all their
Differences; the&s;e <HI>Tartars</HI> being naturally of a
very mild and pliable Temper. The &s;econd of the
Principal <HI>Chans,</HI> is called <HI>Octiervikan,</HI> and the third,
<HI>D' Jan Gari,</HI> but their Territories lying out of the
way of Commerce, and con&s;equently being unfre|quented
by Strangers, are nothing near &s;o well

<HI>Tartars</HI> of <HI>Bogdoi,</HI> &s;ince they have made them&s;elves
Ma&s;ters of <HI>China,</HI> but the&s;e &s;tand in little fear of
them, as having the Advantage of their Fire-Arms

are altogether unacquainted; and the De&s;arts be|twixt
them and the <HI>Calmucks</HI> or <HI>Calmuches,</HI> &s;erve

good Corre&s;pondence with the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> by rea|&s;on

which having &s;way'd the Scepter of this &s;pa|cious
Empire, till the Year 1368, was expell'd by
the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> and the Imperial Diadem be&s;tow'd up|on
the Family of <HI>Tayminga.</HI> After this Family had
reign'd very peaceably for near the &s;pace of 300

They &s;carce profe&s;s any certain Religion, but wear

in the Year 1605, when &s;ome of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI>

few <HI>Samoyedes</HI> (of whom we &s;hall &s;peak at large in

The River overflows the adjacent Plains in

the&s;e <HI>Tartarians</HI> have great &s;woln Throats, like in
<HI>Italy,</HI> the Inhabitants under the <HI>Alpes.</HI></P>
<P>All the <HI>Tartars</HI> in tho&s;e Parts are of a &s;warthy
Complexion, inclining to an Olive colour: They
have broad Faces, flat below, but ri&s;ing on the up|per-part,
their Eyes very &s;mall, but brisk and
&s;parkling; they have very &s;hort and flat No&s;es,
wearing a little Hair upon their upper Lips or Chins.
The Stature and Proportion of their Bodies is very
large, &s;omething above the common Size,
they are clean and well proportion'd in their
Limbs; their Air, tho' &s;omewhat &s;tern and re&s;o|lute,
yet carries not any marks of Cruelty or Sa|vagene&s;s
along with it. Their Habits re&s;emble that
of mo&s;t all the other <HI>Tartars,</HI> both <HI>Europaeans</HI> and
<HI>A&s;iaticks,</HI> being made in the nature of a Ca&s;&s;ock
or large Ve&s;t, fitted to their Bodies, but the Ma|terials
are for the mo&s;t part only Sheep-Skins. A|bout
the Wa&s;te they wear a Cord or &s;mall Girdle,
wherein hangs their Bow and Quiver, which are
their con&s;tant Companions, wherever they go.
Their Heads are &s;hav'd to the Crown, where they
pre&s;erve a good Tuft of Hair, thick enough to make
two good Locks, one of which hangs down before,
the other behind. Upon their Heads they were no
other Covering, than a round Cap, or rather Bon|net,
made of the &s;ame Stuff with their Habits;
only that on the top of it, there is a pretty large
Tuft of red, white or green Silk, or perhaps of
&s;ome other colour, according to the Cu&s;tom of
&s;uch <HI>Hordes,</HI> as they belong to; the&s;e <HI>Hordes</HI> wear|ing
the&s;e different colour'd Tufts, as a certain
mark, whereby to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from one

another. Their Chief Men among them, e&s;pecially
&s;uch as live in tho&s;e places where the Sables and
Martins are caught, make their Garments either of
tho&s;e Furrs, or el&s;e of Dog-Skins, and &s;ometimes,
e&s;pecially during the Winter, they join both toge|ther.
They generally wear the Hair of the Dogs (of
which they keep a great number) outermo&s;t mak|ing
the Furrs of the Sables or Martins the Lining to
the other; not, but that they are &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;i|ble,

Beauty and Value; but, &s;ay they, <HI>We do not think
it ju&s;t, that the Dog, who in his life-time had been &s;o
&s;erviceable to us, in finding out and catching the Sa|bles
or Martins, &s;hould be deba&s;ed after his death, be|low
tho&s;e he conquer'd, but that his pa&s;t Service ought
to be remembered, by preferring him after his death be|fore
his enemy, which he vanqui&s;hed when alive.</HI></P>
<P>It is ea&s;ie to be imagined, that the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI>
after they had hunted out the&s;e &s;o far di&s;tant Coun|tries,
did not acquie&s;ce here, but left no Stone un|turned
till they had made them&s;elves an ea&s;ie Pa&s;|&s;age

When the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Merchants undertake this

of the Winter-Sea&s;on, which being the mo&s;t com|modious
in <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> for Travelling, by rea&s;on of
the Rivers and Lakes (which in the Summer-time
are no &s;mall Ob&s;tacles to Travellers) being all
frozen over, they u&s;ually &s;et out towards the latter
end of <HI>February,</HI> or the beginning of <HI>March,</HI> when
the Snow being well beaten, they Travel in Sleds
from the City of <HI>Mu&s;co</HI> to <HI>Tobol,</HI> the Capital City

and from thence to the <HI>To&s;tiouski,</HI> a <HI>Horde</HI> of <HI>Tartars,</HI>
under the Subjection of the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI> Here they
change their Carriage (which they &s;end back into
<HI>Siberia)</HI> for one much more &s;wift and commodious.
For whereas the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Sleds are u&s;ually drawn
but by one Hor&s;e, they make u&s;e in tho&s;e Parts of
a certain Bea&s;t, called the <HI>Reen,</HI> or <HI>Rain-Deer,</HI> which
they put in their Sleds, and to make it go the more
&s;wift, they tye a great Dog behind, that by his bark|ing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Reen, or Rain-Deer.</NOTE>
&s;caring the poor Bea&s;t, makes it run with that
&s;wiftne&s;s, that it carries the Sleds Six or Seven&s;core
Miles a day.</P>
<P>This Creature (probably the <HI>Tarandius</HI> of the
Antients) is by the Modern <HI>Latins</HI> called <HI>Rangifer,</HI>
from the Word <HI>Reen,</HI> which is the Name given it
by the <HI>Laplanders,</HI> who, as likewi&s;e the <HI>Samoyedes,</HI>
and &s;ome other Northern Nations, make a con&s;ide|rable
Advantage of the&s;e Bea&s;ts, not only in their
Sleds, but al&s;o by making Cloaths of their Skins. It
is as big as a large Stagg, but much &s;tronger, with
a very high Brea&s;t, where the Hairs, which are of a
grayi&s;h colour, inclining to white, are very long
and rough. They have cloven Hoofs, the Horn of
which is as hard as Iron, &s;o that making at every
&s;tep an Impre&s;&s;ion in the Ice, they go as &s;ecurely,
as if they were &s;hoo'd with Fro&s;t-Nails, or walk'd

that they often Travel 150 Miles a day, their Horns
<PB N="75" REF="45">
are higher than tho&s;e of the Elk, and larger than a
Stagg. They have on the Forehead two Brow|anklers,
wherewith in the Winter they dig up the
white Mo&s;s from under the Snow for their Food,
and break the Ice, to get Water to quench their
Thir&s;t. For the re&s;t, they are very Sociable Crea|tures,
feeding in Herds, and ea&s;ily tamed, and
made &s;erviceable for the draught of Sleds, which
they perform with an incredible &s;wiftne&s;s.</P>
<P>By the help of the&s;e Creatures the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI>
Merchants Travel with great Expedition, as long
as the Ice continues to bear, to the City of <HI>Gene&s;&s;ay</HI>
or <HI>Jene&s;&s;ay,</HI> built by the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> upon a River of
the &s;ame Name, for the conveniency of Travellers.
From thence they take Boat to go up the two Ri|vers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lake of <HI>Biakala.</HI></NOTE>
<HI>Tongu&s;i</HI> and <HI>Augara,</HI> to the Lake of <HI>Baikala,</HI>
where both the&s;e Rivers have their ri&s;e.</P>
<P>The Waters of this Lake are extraordinary clear,
but what makes the Pa&s;&s;age over it very difficult
and tedious, is, that it being &s;urrounded on all &s;ides
with very high Rocks, and the Winds being thereby
check'd, they blow &s;o variou&s;ly, and from &s;everal
Points at a time, that they put the Ma&s;ters of the
Ve&s;&s;els to a great deal of danger and trouble; &s;o,
that tho' its breadth be not 30 Miles over, yet are
they obliged to &s;pend &s;ometimes a whole Week in
pa&s;&s;ing it.</P>
<P>After they have got over this Lake, they imme|diately
enter towards the South, the Country of
the <HI>Mongul Tartars,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sleds with Sails.</NOTE> where being furni&s;hed with
Mules and Dromedaries, they continue their Jour|ney

by the help of Sails upon a Level. This is per|formed
by the help of Sails, which when the Wind
favours, they put up in their Sleds, &s;o that by this
means they are driven along, &s;ometimes over the

<P>It will perhaps &s;eem &s;trange to tho&s;e, who have
&s;ome knowledge of the&s;e North-Ea&s;tern Parts, that
whereas the&s;e Travelling Merchants might with more

as being both more chargeable and trouble&s;ome.

what has been &s;aid, that the <HI>Grand Tartary</HI> betwixt
<HI>China</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> is not &s;o De&s;art, as has been
imagined, there are in&s;urmountable Ob&s;tacles in
the&s;e Rivers, which are &s;ufficient to deter even the
be&s;t Seamen in the World, much more the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI>
who are hitherto not the mo&s;t expert in Sea-Affairs.
Not to mention here an almo&s;t infinite number of
Rivers, who&s;e Names are not &s;o much as known in
<HI>Europe,</HI> the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, both for the abun|dance
of Water, and extent of their Cour&s;e, are
the Rivers <HI>Oby, Gene&s;&s;ay,</HI> or <HI>Jene&s;&s;ay, Lena,</HI> and <HI>Ya|mour.</HI>
The two fir&s;t have this Inconveniency, that,
where they di&s;embogue into the Sea, they are al|mo&s;t
all the Year long, &s;o choak'd up with whole
Mountains of Ice, that they are extreamly dange|rous,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Samoyedes, Groenland, Livonia and
Courland.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Samoyedes</HI> or <HI>Samogedes,</HI> inhabit that Tract
of Ground, which lies North-Ea&s;t of <HI>Siberia,</HI>
on both &s;ides of the River <HI>Oby,</HI> extending to the
Streight of <HI>Weigats</HI> in the <HI>Frozen Sea;</HI> their Habi|tation
being under the frigid Zone it &s;elf. This
Country was fir&s;t di&s;covered to the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> by
a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Merchant, who&s;e name was <HI>Oneke,</HI> who
having for a con&s;iderable time traded with the In|habitants
in rich Furrs, and gathered great Wealth,
at la&s;t made a Di&s;covery of it to the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;|covy,</HI>
who having &s;ent thither a &s;plendid Emba&s;&s;y,
they &s;oon per&s;uaded them to &s;ubmit to His Czari&s;h
Maje&s;ty, paying a certain number of Sable Skins
for their yearly Tribute. They were formerly
comprehended under the name of tho&s;e the Anti|ents,
called <HI>Shytes</HI> or <HI>Sarmates,</HI> it being certain,
that the word <HI>Samoyedes,</HI> is a Mu&s;covian Word, &s;ig|nifying
as much as &s;elf-eaters, compo&s;ed out of
<HI>Sam,</HI> which &s;ignifies ones &s;elf, and <HI>Geda</HI> to eat, be|cau&s;e
they u&s;ed to eat the Bodies of their dead
Friends, mixed with their Veni&s;on, in the la&s;t of
which, this Country abounds, and always was, and
is to this day, their ordinary Food. Some would
have them to be the &s;ame <HI>Abii,</HI> of which <HI>Curtius</HI>
&s;peaks, that they &s;ent Amba&s;&s;adors to <HI>Alexander
the Great,</HI> and that they were called <HI>Obii</HI> from the
River <HI>Oby.</HI> Tho' they have no Cities, yet do they
not live a Vagabond-life, like mo&s;t of the <HI>Tar|tars,</HI>
but have their &s;ettled Habitations, which are
certain Cabans or Huts, &s;ome Foot deep under the
Ground, of a circular Figure, built Vault-wi&s;e
<PB N="79" REF="47">
a top, having in the middle of it a Hole, under|neath
which is the Fire-place, round about
which they lie during the Winter; it &s;erves both
for a Chimney, and &s;ometimes for a Door, thro'
which they let in the Air, when the others are
&s;topt up by the Snow, which falls here often &s;ix or
&s;even Foot high. During this Sea&s;on, which la&s;ts
&s;ix Months, and keeps them in continual Darkne&s;s;
their Corre&s;pondence is maintain'd betwixt them
by the Trenches or Walks under Ground from one
Hut to another, by which means they vi&s;it one an|other,
the ab&s;ence of the Sun being &s;upplied by
the melancholy light of Lamps, fed with Oil,
drawn of a certain Fi&s;h, of which as well as of
all other Nece&s;&s;aries, they make provi&s;ion in the
Summer; which Sea&s;on begins here, as &s;oon as the
Sun comes to the <HI>Equinoctial</HI> Line, and enters into
the <HI>Septentrional</HI> Signs of the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> and rejoyces
them with a Day as long, but not &s;o tedious, as the
Night had been before. It is then they leave their
doleful Huts, and apply them&s;elves to their u&s;ual
Employments, which is chiefly Hunting. I am apt
to believe that it is upon the Account of the&s;e <HI>Sa|moyedes,</HI>
that &s;ome have founded their fabulous
Narrations of a certain People that &s;leep &s;ix Months
in the year, or that die in the beginning of Win|ter,
and ri&s;e up again in the Spring, like the Swal|lows
or Frogs; as that, what has been related
of &s;ome of the Northern Countreys, to wit, that
there are People there without Heads, having their
Eyes in their Brea&s;ts; That they have Feet &s;o big,
as that one of them &s;hades the whole Body, and
being thus covered with their Feet, neither Sun nor
Rain can come at them, que&s;tionle&s;s owes its Ori|gin
to their Garments and Pattins they make u&s;e of
in the Winter. For, their upper Garments are
made like Ve&s;ts, or rather Co&s;aques, falling down
to the mid-leg, border'd below with Furr, open
only at the bottom (by which they get into them)
and in the upper part, where they put out their
Faces; when the Cold is exce&s;&s;ive, they cover
<PB N="80" REF="48">
their Heads with a certain Cap, like to the <HI>Capu|chines,</HI>
made in the &s;ame Fa&s;hion with the Head of
a Man. So in the Winter-time, the&s;e <HI>Samoyedes,</HI>
as well as the <HI>Laplanders,</HI> and <HI>Finlanders,</HI> wear a
kind of Shooes or Pattins, made of Bark of Trees,
or &s;ome very thin Wood; Tho&s;e that are worn by
the <HI>Samoyedes,</HI> are an Ell and a half long towards
the Toe, but tho&s;e of the <HI>Laplanders</HI> and <HI>Finlanders,</HI>
are as long to the Heels as to the Toes; they u&s;e
them with &s;o much Agility upon the Snow, that
down a Hill, they will out-do in &s;wiftne&s;s &s;ome
Hor&s;es. For the re&s;t, their Garments are made of
the Skins of the <HI>Reens,</HI> the Nerves and Veins of
the&s;e Bea&s;ts &s;erving them for Thread to &s;ow their
Cloaths; At the end of the Sleeves of their Co&s;aques
they have their Muffs &s;owed on, which they either
let hang loo&s;e, or make u&s;e of to cover their Hands,
as occa&s;ion requires. Under the&s;e Co&s;aques they
wear Shirts made of the Skins of young <HI>Reens</HI> or
<HI>Rain-Deer,</HI> which, having very &s;hort Hair, are &s;ofter
than Linnen, and under the&s;e Shirts they wear their
Drawers. Upon their Heads they wear very large
Caps or Bonnets, which hang down round about
their Necks; they are commonly made by the <HI>Mu&s;|covites,</HI>
of Cloath of &s;everal Colours, lin'd with
Furr, and &s;old to the <HI>Samoyedes.</HI> They wear al&s;o
Boots with the Furr on the out-&s;ide, which makes
them appear at fir&s;t &s;ght, more like Savage Bea&s;ts
than Men. They have a way of &s;craping the in|&s;ide
of the Bark of Beech as fine as the Shavings of
Ivory, which &s;erves them for Handkerchiefs, for
they take a Handful of it at a time, to wipe their
Faces, No&s;es or Hands. The length of the Win|ter
Sea&s;on making their Ground not fit for Tillage,
they have no Corn nor Cattle, &s;o that they are con|tented,
to live upon what Nature affords them:
their Food being Fi&s;h dry'd in the Wind and Sun,
in&s;tead of Bread, Honey and Veni&s;on; and the
Fle&s;h of young Whelps or Puppies, is e&s;teem'd a
dainty Fare among them. Their Stature is very
low and mean, having very &s;hort Legs, almo&s;t
<PB N="81" REF="48" MS="y">
like the <HI>Groenlanders,</HI> of whom we &s;hall have occa|&s;ion
to &s;peak anon; their faces large and flat with|out
Beards, and their Eyes very little, like the
<HI>Tartars,</HI> but not &s;o &s;parkling. The Women here
are very ugly, &s;o that by their Faces and Cloaths,
which are exactly like to the Men's, their Sex is
not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed at fir&s;t &s;ight. Notwith&s;tand|ing
which, they are very jealous of them, being
extreamly nice in pre&s;erving their Wives for their
own U&s;e. For this rea&s;on they buy them at the
Age of &s;ix or &s;even from their Parents, without
daring to look upon them before the Bargain is
made, the u&s;ual payment is a certain number of
Deers, the only valuable Commodity their Coun|try
affords, thus thinking them&s;elves a&s;&s;ured of
their Virginity, they keep them very clo&s;e, nay
more &s;trict than in <HI>Italy,</HI> both before and after
Marriage, and there is &s;ome who affirm, that when
they go abroad a Hunting, they make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> a cer|tain

In&s;tance, that Ugline&s;s is no pre&s;ervative

<P>Their Language and Laws are equally unknown
to Strangers, the latter being altogether e&s;tabli&s;hed
by Cu&s;tom, before they &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to the
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Government. He that is the be&s;t Magi|cian,
is con&s;idered among them as the mo&s;t excel|lent
Man; if they happen to &s;ell any of their Deer
to Strangers, they re&s;erve to them&s;elves the En|trails,
which they keep for their own eating. Their
Arms are no other than a Bow and Arrows, which
they make u&s;e of when they go abroad a Hunting,
which being their continual Exerci&s;e, they are mo&s;t
excellent at Shooting; they have al&s;o a certain way
of Dancing, but the mo&s;t ridiculous in the World.
They were formerly all Pagans and Idolaters; for
when the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in the Year 1595. in their
Voyage to the North, landed &s;ome of their Men
near the Streight of <HI>Weigats,</HI> they found near the
Sea-&s;ide abundance of Idols, for which the <HI>Samo|yedes</HI>
had &s;o much Affection, that they would not
<PB N="82" REF="49">
allow the <HI>Dutch,</HI> tho' never &s;o much entreated, to
carry away one of them. But, in this Age the
Chri&s;tian Religion was planted there by the help of
a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Wolodimer,</HI> who having been
&s;ent thither with &s;ome Prie&s;ts, brought mo&s;t of

this Creature being very difficult to Hunt mo&s;t ge|nerally

other Cities in that Country, to <HI>Go&s;win d' Eck,</HI> the
then Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Livonian</HI> Order of Knights.
The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> have for above the&s;e Hundred Years
pa&s;t been very ambitious to unite, not only this
City, but al&s;o the whole <HI>Livonia,</HI> with the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI>
Empire, which has occa&s;ioned &s;everal Wars, not

Knights, but al&s;o with the <HI>Swedes,</HI> after this City
had put it &s;elf under the Protection of <HI>Eric,</HI> King
of <HI>Sweden,</HI> near a Hundred and Fifty Years ago.
This City is very Famous for two memorable Sieges
it held out again&s;t the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> the fir&s;t, in the
Year 1570. the &s;econd, in the Year 1577. both
which the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> were forced to rai&s;e with
great Lo&s;s. The City is fortified according to the
Modern way, but its chief &s;trength lies in its Ca&s;tle,
which being mo&s;t advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated upon a
Rock, &s;teepy on all &s;ides, renders it almo&s;t un|acce&s;&s;ible,
except towards the City, where it is de|fended
by very good Works. It has a mo&s;t excel|lent
Haven, fitted rather by Nature than Art, for
the convenience of Trade, e&s;pecially with <HI>Mu&s;|covy.</HI>
It is one of the mo&s;t Antient Towns belong|ing
to the <HI>Han&s;eatick</HI> League, and had for &s;ome
Years, in Conjunction with the City of <HI>Lubeck,</HI> the
Direction of the College belonging to the <HI>Han&s;ea|tick

very flouri&s;hing in its Commerce, from the Year
1477. till the Year 1550. when having broken
with the other <HI>Han&s;eatick Towns,</HI> the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI>

their Wings have been clip'd of late Years, as to
&s;everal Priviledges granted to them formerly by
the Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Livonian</HI> Order, and were &s;ince
look'd upon as dangerous to the Prerogatives of
their Sovereign. The Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government is
here, like in mo&s;t other Commonwealths that
profe&s;s the Prote&s;tant Religion, according to the
Tenure of the <HI>Ausburg</HI> Confe&s;&s;ion, admini&s;tred by
a Con&s;i&s;tory and a Superintendent; And their Civil
Con&s;titution comes very near to a <HI>Democratical</HI>
State, the Magi&s;trates having no Power to Tran|&s;act
any thing of moment, without the Advice of
the Principal Men of &s;everal Profe&s;&s;ions, and in
Matters of Extraordinary Con&s;equence, not with|out
Summoning every Freeman of the City. With|in
half a League of it, towards the Sea-&s;ide, are
to be &s;een the Ruins of a &s;tately Mona&s;tery, about
200 Years ago dedicated to St. <HI>Bridget,</HI> by a very
wealthy Merchant of this City. The only thing
Remarkable here, is, a Book compo&s;ed of the
Foundation of this Mona&s;tery, intimating, That
the Religious Men and Women (for it con&s;i&s;ted of

<P>The next City of Note in the Province of <HI>E&s;t|honie,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Narva.</NOTE>
is <HI>Narva,</HI> &s;ituate in the Circuit of <HI>Allentaken,</HI>
at 60 degrees Elevation. It hath its Name from
the River <HI>Narva</HI> or <HI>Nerva,</HI> which having its ri&s;e in
the Lake <HI>Pripis,</HI> falls with a very &s;wift Current in|to
the Gulph of <HI>Finland,</HI> about Ten Miles below
this City. Near three Miles above it, there is a
mo&s;t dangerous Cataract or Water-fall, which
<PB N="89" REF="52">
obliges the Ships that come down the River from
<HI>Ple&s;cou</HI> and other Places to <HI>Narva,</HI> to unlade their
Merchandizes near that Place. This Town, which
is not very large, but exceeding &s;trong, by rea&s;on
of the adjacent Ca&s;tle, is &s;aid to be built, as well
as the City of <HI>Revel,</HI> by <HI>Wolmar</HI> II. King of <HI>Den|mark,</HI>
and was in the Year 1558. be&s;ieged and ta|ken
by <HI>John Ba&s;ilovits,</HI> Great Duke of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI>
but recovered by the <HI>Swedes</HI> in the Year 1581. un|der
the Conduct of <HI>Pontus de la Garde,</HI> the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI>
General, under who&s;e Juri&s;diction it remains to this
day. It hath for many Years pa&s;t enjoyed the &s;ame
Priviledges with the other <HI>Han&s;eatick Towns,</HI> and
was in the la&s;t Age a Place of very good Traffick,
till the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Trade was from thence, by the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> transferred to <HI>Archangel,</HI> and
the Wars betwixt the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> and <HI>Swedes</HI> de|&s;troyed
its Commerce. During the War betwixt
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> in <HI>Oliver Cromwel</HI>'s Time,
the Commerce to <HI>Archangel</HI> being interrupted, there
began to be a Pro&s;pect of reviving the Trade into
<HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> abundance of Ships making u&s;e of this
Harbour for that purpo&s;e at that time, &s;o, that the
Haven was repaired, and &s;everal new Additions
were made to the Town, for the Conveniency of
Strangers. It has two Ca&s;tles belonging to it, one
on this &s;ide of the River, and the other on the op|po&s;ite
Shoar, in a Penin&s;ula, made by the River
<HI>Nerva.</HI> It is called <HI>Ivanovogorod,</HI> and was built
there by the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> upon a Rock, &s;o inacce&s;&s;ible,
that it was judged Impregnable, and was not taken
by the <HI>Swedes,</HI> till in the Year 1617. when <HI>Gu&s;tavus
Adolphus</HI> made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of it. At the foot
of this Ca&s;tle is another &s;mall Town, or rather
Suburb, called <HI>Narva Mu&s;covite,</HI> being inhabited
by <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> but &s;ubject to the Crown of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
under the Juri&s;diction of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Governour of
the Ca&s;tle. Betwixt <HI>Revel</HI> and <HI>Narva,</HI> there are
in the Woods, Bears and Wolves of an extraordi|nary
bigne&s;s, which, during the Winter-Sea&s;on, do
abundance of Mi&s;chief to the Pea&s;ants. There is
<PB N="90" REF="53">
in <HI>Narva</HI> to be &s;een the Skin of a Wolf of a prodi|gious
Size, which is &s;aid to have kill'd &s;ix Pea&s;ants
out of twelve he met upon the Road before he was
killed him&s;elf. They fa&s;ten commonly a great Stick
to their Sleds, which Noi&s;e they believe frightens
the Wolves and makes them run away.</P>
<P>The Capital City of the &s;econd Province in <HI>Li|vonia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Riga.</NOTE>

Its origin is &s;omewhat doubtful, both as to the
time, and the true name of its fir&s;t Founder; &s;ome
having a&s;cribed it to <HI>Albert,</HI> the third Bi&s;hop of
<HI>Livonia,</HI> in the Year 1196. Others to one <HI>Bertold,</HI>
of the Order of the <HI>White Fryars,</HI> Abbot of <HI>Lock|en</HI>
in the Country of <HI>Shovenburgh,</HI> in the Dioce&s;s
of <HI>Mindea,</HI> who is &s;aid to have built it in the year
1189, and to have made it a Bi&s;hop's Seat. But
it is beyond que&s;tion, that in the Year 1215, it was
rai&s;ed to the Dignity of an Arch-Bi&s;hoprick, and
made the Seat of the Metropolitan of all <HI>Livonia,
Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Courland.</HI> This occa&s;ioned afterwards
great Jar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ngs betwixt the <HI>Livonian</HI> Knights and

the Sovereignty and Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice
in this place, which was at &s;everal times divided
betwixt them, till the Reformation put a &s;top to
their further Differences, by taking from them all
the Authority they formerly had in this City. It
&s;urrendred it &s;elf by a voluntary Rendition to the
Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> in the Year 1561, during the
War the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> made in <HI>Livonia</HI> about that
Time. Since which it was twice, but in vain, be|&s;ieged
by <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Sudermannia</HI> (Uncle to
<HI>Sigi&s;mond,</HI> King of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Sweden)</HI> after he
had got into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Kingdom of <HI>Sweden.</HI>
But <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus,</HI> took it at la&s;t in the Year
1621, by Compo&s;ition, after a Siege of &s;ix Weeks,
and the <HI>Swedes</HI> remain ever &s;ince in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it;

the two Crowns of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> in the Year

ten or twelve Miles from hence di&s;charges it &s;elf

It is well fortified on the Land-&s;ide, to wit, with
&s;ix regular Ba&s;tions, and as many half Moons, the
Counter&s;carp being Palli&s;ado'd. It is very popu|lous,
becau&s;e of the extraordinary Concour&s;e of
People, that flock hither both in Winter and Sum|mer
on the account of Commerce, which, while
the <HI>Baltick Sea</HI> is Navigable, is carried on with the
<HI>Engli&s;h, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Han&s;eatick Towns,</HI> and when

for Sleds, with the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI> All &s;orts of Pro|vi&s;ions
are extreamly Cheap here, but e&s;pecially
Veni&s;on, by rea&s;on that the Pea&s;ants have a Privi|ledge
hereabouts to Hunt at plea&s;ure. The <HI>Luthe|ran</HI>
is the e&s;tabli&s;hed Religion here, with exclu&s;ion
of all others, whether <HI>Prote&s;tants, Catholicks</HI> or

their white Cloaks a red &s;hort Sword, with a Star

<HI>Barbarians,</HI> and to have the third part of all that
they gain'd from their Enemies. But in regard this
New Religious Order at fir&s;t was &s;carce &s;ufficient
to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon its own Bottom, it was joyn'd to
the Order of St. <HI>Mary of Jeru&s;alem,</HI> in the Year
1238. in the Per&s;on of <HI>Herman Balek,</HI> Grand Ma|&s;ter
of the <HI>Teutonick</HI> Order in <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia;</HI> &s;ince which
time, the Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Livonian</HI> Order had a de|pendance
from the Grand Ma&s;ters of that Order,
till being hardly pre&s;s'd upon by the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI>
they were forced to &s;ubmit to the Protection of
the Crown of <HI>Poland.</HI> It is from hence, that the
Emperours of <HI>Germany</HI> fir&s;t claim'd the Title over
the&s;e Lords or Ma&s;ters of the Order of <HI>Livonia,</HI>
and in the Year 1513. they became entirely Sub|jects
of the Empire, when the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Riga,</HI>
with his Suffragans, and the Ma&s;ter of the Knightly
Order, who had in part freed him&s;elf of the Sub|jection
of the Grand Ma&s;ter of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> were re|ceived
among the Princes of the Empire. But the
<HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> by rea&s;on of its convenient Situation,
had for a con&s;iderable time look'd upon it with a
wi&s;hful Eye, and in the Year 1501. entred it with
a very Powerful Army, but were vanqui&s;h'd in a
<PB N="96" REF="56">
pitch'd Battel, fought betwixt them and <HI>Walter de
Plattenbergh,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Livonian</HI> Order, where
40000 <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> were kill'd upon the &s;pot, which
obliged them to make a Truce with the <HI>Livonians</HI>
for Fifty Years. This being expired, the Grand
Duke of <HI>Mu&s;covy, John Ba&s;ilovits,</HI> being flu&s;h'd
with his late Conque&s;ts of the Kingdoms of <HI>Ca&s;an</HI>
and <HI>A&s;trachan,</HI> and taking Advantage of the Dif|ferences
that were then betwixt the Ma&s;ter of the
Knightly Order, and the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Riga,</HI>
entred <HI>Livonia</HI> with a numerous Army, and having
ruined all with Fire and Sword in the Bi&s;hoprick of
<HI>Derpt</HI> or <HI>Torpat</HI> and <HI>Wirland,</HI> retreated into <HI>Mu&s;|covy.</HI>
This having put the whole Country into a
great Con&s;ternation, they were for &s;eeking Aid in
all Parts, and having made their fir&s;t Application
to the Empire, but with little Succe&s;s, the City of
<HI>Revel,</HI> which was the mo&s;t expo&s;ed of all, offered
to put it &s;elf under the Protection of the King of
<HI>Denmark,</HI> which having been refu&s;ed, they had
recour&s;e to <HI>Eric,</HI> King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> who likewi&s;e
refu&s;ed them the de&s;ired Succours of Men and Mo|ney,
unle&s;s they would put them&s;elves under his
Protection (in which ca&s;e he would maintain them
in their Priviledges) the City and adjacent Nobi|lity
&s;eparated from the Ma&s;ter of the Order, and
&s;ubmitted to the Protection of the Crown of
<HI>Sweden</HI> in the Year 1560. In the mean while,
the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Riga,</HI> and the Coadjutor
of the Order of <HI>Livonia</HI> had made a League
Defen&s;ive with <HI>Sigi&s;mund Augu&s;tus,</HI> King of
<HI>Poland,</HI> unto whom they had promi&s;ed 300000 <HI>l.
Sterling</HI> towards the defraying the Charges of the
War, and for his Security, had engaged &s;eve|ral
Bailywicks; But the King of <HI>Poland</HI> being
&s;en&s;ible of the extream danger they were in, and
how the City of <HI>Revel,</HI> and the Province of <HI>E&s;t|honie</HI>
or <HI>E&s;thland,</HI> had been forced to &s;ubmit them|&s;elves
to the Crown of <HI>Sweden,</HI> refu&s;ed to execute
the Treaties, unle&s;s they would follow the Exam|ple

<PB N="97" REF="56">
upon the &s;ame terms to the Crown of <HI>Poland,</HI> as
they had done to <HI>Sweden.</HI> Being therefore reduced
to an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of chu&s;ing the lea&s;t Evil,
the Archbi&s;hop and Ma&s;ter of the Order were
forced to Surrender all the Acts and Charters they
had obtained from the Emperour and Pope, into
the Hands of Prince <HI>Radzivil,</HI> who, in the King
of <HI>Poland</HI>'s Name, received al&s;o from them the
Oath of Fidelity. The King of <HI>Poland</HI> gave the
Title of Duke, with the Country of <HI>Gourland,</HI> to
the Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Livonian</HI> Order, as we have &s;aid
before, in the De&s;cription of <HI>Courland,</HI> in the Year
1562. And Twenty Years after, to wit, in the Year
1582. by vertue of a Peace concluded with the
<HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> the <HI>Poles</HI> got into Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole
<HI>Livonia,</HI> except that part of <HI>E&s;thonie</HI> which had &s;ur|rendred
to the <HI>Swedes;</HI> who by degrees got all the
re&s;t from the <HI>Poles,</HI> which was entirely re&s;ign'd to
them in the Year 1666. by the Treaty of Peace
made betwixt the&s;e two Crowns, in the Mona&s;tery
of <HI>Oliva,</HI> near <HI>Dantzick.</HI></P>
<P>The Country of <HI>Livonia</HI> is very fertile, but e&s;pe|cially
in Wheat, abounding in all &s;orts of Cattle,

Crown, and a good Hare for a Groat; but has
within the&s;e two Years la&s;t pa&s;t been &s;o oppre&s;s'd
with Famine, that a great many Thou&s;ands of the

Country of <HI>Lettie</HI> and <HI>E&s;thonie,</HI> have nothing they
can call their own, but are ab&s;olute Slaves either to
the Nobility or Chief Citizens. They are called
by the <HI>Germans, &V;nteut&s;che,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>no Ger|mans,</HI>

Subjection, they would be always endeavouring to
recover their Liberty at any rate, of which they
have given &s;ome Proofs, when ever any Occa&s;ion
pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>The Origin of the <HI>Livonian</HI> Nobility is founded
upon the Services they have in former Ages done
again&s;t the Infidels and <HI>Mu&s;covites;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their No|bility.</NOTE> they are free
from all Taxes and Charges. <HI>Volmar</HI> II. King of
<HI>Denmark,</HI> was the fir&s;t that gave them Mannors to
hold in Fealty, which were confirmed by <HI>Eric</HI> VII.
by Letters Patents, and augmented by the Ma&s;ters
of the <HI>Short Sword,</HI> and the Grand Ma&s;ters of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia.</HI>
Some of the&s;e Mannors, e&s;pecially in the Di&s;tricts
of <HI>Harrie</HI> and <HI>Wirland,</HI> are Inheritable by the Daugh|ters
and their I&s;&s;ue, to the fifth degree. But they
are above all beholding to that Famous <HI>Walter de
Plattenbergh,</HI> who being in the Year 1513. acknow|ledged
a Prince of the Empire, exempted the No|bility
from all Subjection, excepting &s;uch Services
as they were obliged to do in Per&s;on, upon the ac|count
of their Mannors. When Nece&s;&s;ity obliged
them to have recour&s;e to the <HI>Swedes,</HI> they did not
&s;ubmit to that Crown, but with a <HI>Provi&s;o,</HI> of re|taining
their Antient Priviledges, which, for the
mo&s;t part, they keep to this day. There is once a
Year a Review made of this Nobility, which does
not only, upon occa&s;ion, furni&s;h the King of <HI>Sweden</HI>
with a con&s;iderable Body of Hor&s;e, but al&s;o is
look'd upon by the <HI>Sweden</HI> as their chief Nur&s;ery of
Officers, even to the Generals of Armies. The
Admini&s;tration of the Government, both as to Po|licy
and Ju&s;tice, is committed to Twelve of the
Body of the Nobility, who are the Council of the
Country, of which, the Governour of the Province
from the Crown of <HI>Sweden,</HI> is Pre&s;ident. Their
Judicial Proce&s;&s;es are very &s;hort, and decided once
a Year, to wit, in <HI>January,</HI> by this Council, who,
after a Declaration and an An&s;wer, proceed im|mediately
<PB N="99" REF="57">
to Judgment. To perform this with the
more conveniency, each Province has its own Cap|tain,
as they call him, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s is, to repre|&s;ent
to the Governour and Council the Grievances
of the People, and this Employment is never con|tinued
above three Years in the &s;ame Per&s;on. There
are al&s;o certain Triennial Judges appointed for the
determining of Differences in the flat Country;
concerning the Limits betwixt Private Men, which
have been rendred dubious by the Wars; and &s;ome
other Judges or Over&s;eers of the High-ways, Bridges,
and Cau&s;ways; But from all the&s;e there lies an
Appeal to the Council of the Country.</P>
<P>As to their Religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Re|ligion.</NOTE> they are <HI>Lutherans</HI> here,
which mu&s;t be chiefly under&s;tood from the Nobility
and Inhabitants of Cities, but, as for the Pea&s;ants;
they can &s;carce be called half Chri&s;tians, much le&s;s,
to be &s;aid of any particular Religion, being, even
to this day, &s;o deeply entangled in their Heatheni&s;h
Super&s;titions, that they &s;carce ever go to Church,
or at lea&s;t, never Communicate, unle&s;s it be by
force, they being, notwith&s;tanding that wretched
and &s;lavi&s;h Condition they live in, quite regardle&s;s
of any thing el&s;e but this Life. 'Tis upon this Ac|count,
that, when they take an Oath, they con|clude
with the&s;e words: <HI>If I do not &s;wear true, I
am content, that the Cur&s;e of God may light upon my
Body and Soul, upon my Children, upon all what ap|pertains
to me, to the Ninth Generation.</HI> Some of
them, e&s;pecially the Pea&s;ants about <HI>Riga,</HI> if they
are to take an Oath at Law, put a Turff upon their
Heads, with a white Stick in their Hands, thereby
&s;ignifying, that they con&s;ent, That, <HI>they, their Chil|dren,
and Cattle, may become as dry as the Turff and
Stick,</HI> if they &s;wear fal&s;ely. They frequently put
a Needle and Thread into the Grave with the de|cea&s;ed,
becau&s;e, for&s;ooth, <HI>he may perhaps have occa|&s;ion
to mend his Cloaths in the other World.</HI> Sorcery
is much more frequent among them than Prayers,
the fir&s;t is propagated by Tradition from the Pa|rents
to their Children. They never kill a Bea&s;t,
<PB N="100" REF="58">
but &s;ome part of it is thrown away, nor never brew,
but &s;omething mu&s;t be &s;pilt, which they look upon
as a Pre&s;ervative again&s;t Witchcraft; Nay, they
have a way of rebaptizing their Children them&s;elves
(tho' privately) if in &s;ome Weeks after the fir&s;t
Bapti&s;m they happen to fall &s;ick, which; they &s;ay,
is occa&s;ioned by the Child's having received a Name
not &s;uitable to its Con&s;titution, and therefore are
obliged to give it another. They love to do their
private Devotions upon Hills, or near a Tree, in
which having made &s;everal Inci&s;ions, and ty'd it
up with &s;ome red Stuff, they there offer their Prayers,
which always tend to &s;ome benefit of this Life.
The Pea&s;ants about <HI>Revel</HI> and <HI>Narva</HI> go once a
Year, <HI>viz.</HI> on the day of our Lady's Vi&s;itation, on
Pilgrimage to an old ruin'd Chappel betwixt the&s;e
two Cities, where kneeling before a great Stone
that is in the mid&s;t of it, they offer Fruits and
Fle&s;h as a Sacrifice for the Pre&s;ervation of them|&s;elves
and their Cattle, the whole ending with
Dancing, Drinking, and &s;ometimes Fighting. All
this is not &s;o much to be attributed to their Igno|rance
as Stubbornne&s;s; for there is &s;carce a Village
but what has a Church and Mini&s;ter, and the Bi&s;hop
of the Province re&s;iding at <HI>Revel,</HI> keeps as watchful
an Eye as po&s;&s;ibly he can over the Clergy, be&s;ides
which, the Catechi&s;m, the Go&s;pel and Epi&s;tles, with
certain Explications added to it, have been long
ago tran&s;lated into their Native Tongue, for their
general Benefit; but all this has proved in&s;ufficient
to root out of the&s;e &s;tubborn Pea&s;ants the remnants
of their Idolatrous Super&s;titions.</P>
<P>Their Weddings are in a great mea&s;ure as odd as
&s;ome other of their Cu&s;toms;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Wed|dings.</NOTE> For, if a Pea&s;ant
Marries a Country La&s;s out of another Village, he
gets on Hor&s;eback, with a Stick cleft at the top;
wherein is put a Bra&s;s Piece of Money, thus equip|ped,
and accompanied by two of his Friends with
naked Swords in their Hands, and a Bag-piper ri|ding
before him, he comes to fetch the Bride, whom
he &s;ets behind him, and having made her embrace
<PB N="101" REF="58">
him with the Right-hand, away he rides to the
Hou&s;e where the Marriage is to be con&s;ummated;
when they come to the Door, his two Friends give
each of them a &s;troak with their Swords cro&s;s the
Door of the Hou&s;e, which being opened, he gives
the Bra&s;s Piece of Money to the fir&s;t he meets with
there. Being entred, his two Friends &s;tick their
Swords into a Beam directly over his Head, which
they pretend to be done to prevent Charms; for
which purpo&s;e al&s;o, the Bride, as &s;he comes along
the Road, &s;catters little pieces of &s;ome red Stuff
or another by the way, but e&s;pecially, where any
Cro&s;s-ways meet, or near any Cro&s;&s;es which are put
upon the Graves of little Children, which die with|out
Bapti&s;m, whom they bury in the High-way.
They have however one Cu&s;tom, which, among
People &s;o barbarous, &s;eems to have &s;omething ex|traordinary
in it. For, after the Bride and Bride|groom
are &s;et down at the Table with the Gue&s;ts,
they don't tarry long there, but within half an
hour, leaving the Gue&s;ts to them&s;elves, they get to
Bed, after having for the &s;pace of two hours try'd
one anothers Vigour, return to the Table, where,
with Drinking and Dancing they &s;pend the remain|der
of the Day and following Night, till, what
with Wearine&s;s, and what with Drunkenne&s;s, their
Legs begin to fail them, when they all Pig toge|ther
in one Ne&s;t. As for their Garments, they are
&s;uitable to their wretched Condition, to wit, of a
coar&s;e Cloath; the Womens Petticoats being with|out
any Plaits like a Sack. Tho&s;e, who have been
able to &s;ave a little by their Drudgery beyond the
re&s;t, wear about their Necks a Necklace of Plates
of Silver, of the bigne&s;s of a Crown Piece, and
upon the Brea&s;t one hanging down by a Chain as
big as a Trencher, but not very thick; Their Shooes
are either made out of the Barks of Trees, or raw
Leather of a Cows Hide.</P>

concerning the <HI>Cobolds,</HI> as the <HI>Germans,</HI> or <HI>Colky</HI>'s,
as the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> call them, that they dwell'd in the
mo&s;t ob&s;tru&s;e Corners of old Buildings, or among
great Heaps of Wood; and that they would carry
their Neighbours Corn into their Barns, for which
rea&s;on they would be &s;ure every night to leave up|on
the Table the be&s;t of Victuals the Hou&s;e afford|ed.
They believed, that when any of the&s;e <HI>De|mons</HI>
did intend to fix their Habitation in a certain
Hou&s;e, they u&s;ed to make the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e
&s;en&s;ible of their Intention, in the manner follow|ing:
They would carry what &s;mall Wood there
was ready cut in the Hou&s;e together in one Heap,
and put into their Milk-Pans, fill'd with Milk the
Dung of &s;everal Sorts of Creatures. If the Ma|&s;ter
of the Hou&s;e be willing they &s;hould appear
and &s;ettle in his Hou&s;e, he mu&s;t with his whole
Family drink of the Milk thus &s;ea&s;oned with
Dung.</P>
<P>They u&s;ed to keep a perpetual Fire on the top of
a very high Mountain in <HI>Samogitia,</HI> betwixt <HI>Lithu|ania</HI>
and <HI>Livonia,</HI> committed to the Care of certain
Prie&s;ts, in Honour of the Idol <HI>Pargnus,</HI> whom they
believed the God of Thunder and Tempe&s;ts.</P>
<P>To the other Gods we have named before, they
either jointly, or &s;ometimes to one in particular
u&s;ed to &s;acrifice a He-Goat, which was thus per|form'd:
The Prie&s;t, after tho&s;e that were to be
pre&s;ent at the Sacrifice, were A&s;&s;embled, having
laid both his Hands upon the Goat, mutter'd out
certain Prayers to &s;uch God or Gods, as they in|tended
the Sacrifice to, and, having craved his or
their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, all that were pre&s;ent lifted up the
Goat, and held it &s;o long in the Air, till the Prie&s;t
had fini&s;h'd a certain Hymn, which being done,
the Goat was again &s;et upon his Legs on the ground.
<PB N="105" REF="60">
Then the Prie&s;t made a Harrangue to the People,
containing in Sub&s;tance; That <HI>they &s;hould be very
careful in performing this Sacrifice according to the In&s;ti|tution
of their pious Ance&s;tors, with all imaginable Devo|tion,
and tran&s;mit it without blemi&s;h to Po&s;terity.</HI> Having
ended his Sermon, he kill'd the Goat, and having
&s;prinkled the Standers-by with the Blood, the Fle&s;h
is given to the Women to boil; which done, they
fea&s;t upon it all the Night, till they are all drunk,
and if any of the Fle&s;h happen to be left, the next
Morning they bury it under Ground, for fear it
&s;hould be defil'd by the Birds or other Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>Some of the&s;e Pagan Nations u&s;ed to keep Snakes
or Serpents in a certain Corner of the Hou&s;e, e&s;pe|cially
near their S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oves, which heat their Rooms;
at certain times their Prie&s;ts were to come to the
Hou&s;e, and to Conjure the&s;e Creatures to come
forth out of their Holes, and to ta&s;te of &s;uch Dain|ties
as were ready prepared for them upon a Table
&s;et for that Purpo&s;e; if the Snakes are obedient to
the Prie&s;t's Command, and take a Ta&s;te of all what
is &s;et before them, the whole Family, after the
Snakes have withdrawn them&s;elves into their Holes,
eat the re&s;t with a great deal of Joy and Content,
as pre&s;aging to them&s;elves nothing but good For|tune,
for that Year. But if the&s;e Creatures hap|pened
to prove di&s;obedient, not hearkning to the
Conjuring Prie&s;t, they appear very &s;ad and melan|choly,
as believing that &s;ome great Misfortune is
likely to befall them that Year.</P>
<P>They had al&s;o a certain Sort of South&s;ayers, whom
they call'd <HI>Burty</HI> in the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Language; the&s;e
acknowledge for their Patroon, the God <HI>Potrympus,</HI>
unto whom having made their Addre&s;&s;es, and mut|ter'd
out certain Words, they u&s;ed a certain way of
powring melted Wax into Water, and according to
the &s;everal Figures and Shapes that appear'd whil&s;t
they were ca&s;ting, they pretended to re&s;olve &s;uch
Que&s;tions as were pre&s;ented to them.</P>
<P>Their Nuptial and Funeral Rites were performed
in the following manner:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> After the young Couple

two of the neare&s;t Relations of the Bride|groom
u&s;ed to take the Bride, as it was, by force
out of her Fathers Hou&s;e, which being done, they
addre&s;s them&s;elves to the Parents, or &s;uch as have
the Di&s;po&s;al of them, who then publickly give their
Con&s;ent to the Marriage. The Day appointed for
the Con&s;ummation of the Marriage being come,
the Bride, with Bells hanging from the Girdle
down to her Knees, is led three times back and for|ward
into the Kitchen, and being afterwards put
into a Chair, her Feet are wa&s;h'd with Spring Wa|ter,
wherewith they &s;prinkle the Nuptial Bed, their
Hou&s;hold Stuff, and all the Gue&s;ts invited to the
Fea&s;t. After that, they u&s;ed to give to the Bride a
ta&s;te of Honey, and putting a Veil over her Face,
conduct her to every Door that belong'd to the
Hou&s;e, where &s;he was obliged to knock with her
right Foot again&s;t them; In the mean while, a Ser|vant,
who followed her with a Sack, fill'd with all
&s;orts of Corn, to wit, Wheat, Rye, Barley, Oats,
Pea&s;e, Beans, and the Seed of Poppies, u&s;ed to
&s;trow the Ground round about her, wherever &s;he
went, frequently repeating to her the&s;e Words: <HI>If
thou remain'&s;t devout and con&s;tant in thy Religion, and
be'&s;t careful of thy Hou&s;e, thou &s;halt never want any of
the&s;e Things;</HI> Then the Veil is taken away, and the
Bride placed at the Table with the Gue&s;ts, invited
to the Fea&s;t. At night they begin to Dance, and
whil&s;t the Bride is a Dancing, they cut off her Hair,
and put upon her Head a Garland, which the Mar|ried
Women wear till they have brought forth a
Son, being till then look'd upon as Maidens. At
la&s;t, &s;he is conducted into the Room, where the
Nuptial Bed is prepared, and being forced, not
without &s;ome Blows, to undre&s;s her &s;elf, &s;he is
thrown by the re&s;t into the Bed, and let to the Mer|cy
of the Bridegroom. But after an Hour, or there|abouts,
they refre&s;h them&s;elves in Bed with a Cup
of good Liquor, and a Di&s;h of Stones of Kids or

<P>In their Funeral Rites,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Fu|n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rals.</NOTE> they ob&s;erved this Me|thod:
They dre&s;s the Corps of their decea&s;ed Friends
in their be&s;t Cloaths, with Shooes and Stockins, and
having &s;et it up-right in a Chair, the next Relati|ons
making a Ring about it, drink very heartily;
When the Liquor is out, they begin to lament their
Decea&s;ed Friend. <HI>Alas!</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>Why would&s;t
thou die? Did&s;t thou want either Victuals or Drink?
Why would&s;t thou die then? Alas! Had&s;t thou not a

running through every Particular thing po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by
the Decea&s;ed in his Life-time, they ask in the &s;ame
manner; and conclude, <HI>Why would&s;t thou die?</HI> They
are very careful to furni&s;h them with Needle and
Threed, when they are laid in their Coffins, and
with &s;ome Bread and a Bottle of Liquor. When
the Corps is carried out to the Burying-place, the
Relations on Hor&s;eback, &s;urround the Hear&s;e or
Waggon in which it is plac'd, and with their Swords
drawn, &s;trike in the Air cro&s;s-ways, crying out
aloud, <HI>Away you Demons to the infernal Places of
Darkne&s;s.</HI> At la&s;t, whil&s;t the Corps is putting into
the Ground, they throw &s;ome Money after it into
the Grave. The Widdow Mourns for forty Days,
<HI>viz.</HI> Mornings and Evenings, Sun ri&s;ing and &s;etting,
over her Husband's Grave; but the re&s;t of the Re|lations
celebrate the Memory of the Decea&s;ed at
certain appointed Days, to wit, on the Third, the
Sixth, the Ninth, and Fortieth day; when, after a
certain Form of Prayers, which they mutter out
before they enter the Hou&s;e, they invite the Soul of
the Decea&s;ed to come and take part with them.
Whil&s;t they are at Table, there is not a Word to be
&s;poken, neither do they make u&s;e of Knives. They
are attended by two Women, who divide the Vi|ctuals
among the Gue&s;ts, but al&s;o without Knives.
Each of the Gue&s;t throws &s;omething of his Victu|als,
<PB N="108" REF="62" MS="y">
as al&s;o &s;ome of the Liquor, under the Table,
which they believe is the Food of the Soul of the
Decea&s;ed. If any thing happens to fall under the
Table, it is not to be taken up, this being to be left
for the Food of &s;uch Souls as are de&s;titute of
Friends, or are otherwi&s;e unable to Fea&s;t th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">m after

Arms are commonly a Scymiter, a Bow and Qui|v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r,
furni&s;h'd with twenty or more Arrows. The&s;e

not been able to come near them in twi&s;ting of

about them a Knife, which &s;erves to mend their
Bridles and Saddles, if any thing happens to be a|mi&s;s;
a Tinder-box to &s;trike Fire; and a Compa&s;s
to direct them in their March through the De&s;arts

<P>Their Hor&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Hor|&s;es.</NOTE> which they call <HI>Bachmats,</HI> are very
ill-&s;haped, being very long and thin, with long
Manes and Tails; but what they want in Shape
they make up in Swiftne&s;s and Hardine&s;s, being in
both the&s;e Points together, to be preferred before
any other in the World: They commonly undergo
the Fatigue of a long days Journey without the
lea&s;t Food; they are continually kept abroad, both
Winter and Summer; and when they are upon an
Expedition, the&s;e Bea&s;ts will live upon what they
can pick out from under the Snow, or upon the
Mo&s;s, Bark, or &s;mall Branches of Trees, or upon
any thing el&s;e that they light on in their Way.
Their Chief Men make u&s;e of <HI>Arabian</HI> and <HI>Turki&s;h</HI>
Hor&s;es, wear under their Co&s;aques Coats of Mail,
and u&s;e very good Equipages: Their <HI>Chan,</HI> e&s;pe|cially
is mo&s;t Magnificent in his Hor&s;es and Equi|pages,
keeps a very good Table, and lives as to all
other things, in great Splendor, &s;uitable to his Quality.</P>
<P>When they live abroad in their Tents,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Food.</NOTE> they &s;el|dom
eat Bread, in&s;tead of which they make u&s;e of
Millet. Their Ordinary Food is Hor&s;e-fle&s;h, which
they boil, either alone, or with Millet, when they
re&s;t in a Place; but when they are going upon an
Expedition they have it bak'd, and upon the
March, often only roll it together, and put it under
<PB N="114" REF="65">
the Saddle, from whence they take it upon occa|&s;ion,
and &s;o eat it without any further Preparation
or Sauce, unle&s;s it be the Sweat of their Hor&s;es.
The wor&s;t of all is, that they do not chu&s;e the
Younge&s;t or the Fatte&s;t of their Hor&s;es, but &s;uch as
are either rendred un&s;erviceable in a March, or die
of them&s;elves. They don't drink Wine, as being
<HI>Mahometans;</HI> &s;o that their ordinary Drink is
clear Water; and in the Winter, when the Rivers
and Springs are frozen up, they make u&s;e of Snow;
or &s;ometimes of the Broth of bak'd Hor&s;e-fle&s;h,
or a certain Liquor made out of Millet. Their
Chief Officers only, drink Water, Milk, or perhaps
Hydromel and <HI>Aqua vita,</HI> and have now and then
a Di&s;h of Wild-fowl: But all of them ab&s;tain

The mo&s;t redoubtable Enemies they have, if they

is for this rea&s;on they are obliged to March with
great Caution through De&s;arts and unknown Roads,
and, for fear of being di&s;covered, Encamp in the

into a great many Bodies, and &s;o make a running
Fight, our Forces which are obliged to keep their
Rank and Order, not knowing which of them to

where they lived upon Robbing and Plunder.
They were called <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> from their Agility (the
Word <HI>Co&s;a,</HI> intimating as much in the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Lan|guage)
which chiefly con&s;i&s;ted in pa&s;&s;ing betwixt
the innumerable &s;mall I&s;lands, &s;ituate at the mouth
of the River <HI>Bori&s;thenes.</HI> They u&s;ed to commit
their Piracies, for the mo&s;t part, upon the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI>
and are &s;ince that time, not only become for|midable
to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Gallies, but al&s;o to <HI>Natolia</HI>
it &s;elf, where they did not only plunder <HI>Trebi&s;ond</HI>

and brought back their Pri&s;oners and Booty &s;afe to
their Habitatations, in the I&s;les of the <HI>Bori&s;thenes.</HI>

not only again&s;t the Incur&s;ions of the Neighbouring
<HI>Crim</HI> or <HI>Precopian Tartars,</HI> but al&s;o might &s;erve as a

Order and Di&s;cipline, which he effected, by
granting to them, be&s;ides their Pay, very con&s;ide|rable
Priledges, and putting them under the Com|mand
of a General of their own, with a Power to
chu&s;e &s;uch Officers under him, as he e&s;teem'd mo&s;t
fit for Service. Having thus reduced them into one
Body, he gave them the City of <HI>Techtimoravia,</HI> with
all the Territories belonging to it, which being
&s;eated upon the <HI>Bori&s;thenes,</HI> they made it their Ma|gazine,
and the Re&s;idence of their Governour Ge|neral:
And, to render this Body the more Service|able
again&s;t the <HI>Tartars,</HI> he joyned to this Mili|tia
of the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> (being compo&s;ed altogether of
Foot) two thou&s;and Hor&s;e, for the Maintaining of

and were di&s;po&s;ed upon the Frontiers, mo&s;t ex|po&s;ed

to the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> and is now called the <HI>Vk|raine,</HI>
which was before a de&s;olate Country, was in
a little time fill'd with populous Cities and Towns.

to be obedient to the Orders of the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> General.</P>
<P>Their fir&s;t Rebellion was in the Year 1587,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Co|&s;acks</HI> re|bel.</NOTE> un|der
their General, <HI>John Podkowa,</HI> but being van|qui&s;h'd,
he had his Head cut off. In the Year 1596,
<HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> III. King of <HI>Poland,</HI> upon Complaints
made by the <HI>Turks,</HI> forbid them to crui&s;e in the
<HI>Black-Sea,</HI> which Orders they obeyed for that time,
but, &s;oon after fell into the <HI>Poli&s;h Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Lithu|ania,</HI>
where they Ravaged the Country, under their
General, <HI>Nalevaiko.</HI> In vain did the King &s;end his
Orders for them to retire to their Habitations, they
on the contrary, re&s;olved to maintain their Ground,
again&s;t the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Army, which was advancing a|gain&s;t
them, under the Command of the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI>
General <HI>Zolkieuski.</HI> The Battle was fought near the
City of <HI>Bialacerkiovia,</HI> where the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> had the
better of it; but <HI>Zolkieuski,</HI> as he was a Great Ge|neral,
having weather'd the Point for that time,
&s;oon after got them into the Trap, &s;o that they
were forced to &s;ubmit, and deliver up their Gene|ral,
<HI>Nalevaiko,</HI> who underwent the &s;ame Fate as
his Predece&s;&s;or. In the Year 1637, the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> re|volted
again, the Occa&s;ion was thus: A great ma|ny
<HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Lords, having Purcha&s;ed E&s;tates in the
<HI>Vkraine</HI> (the Quarter of the <HI>Co&s;acks)</HI> and ob&s;erving,
that the Boors, their Va&s;&s;als, run frequently over
to them, they were of Opinion, that their Reve|nues
could never be well &s;ecured, as long as the
<HI>Co&s;acks</HI> enjoyed their Priviledges. Having there|fore
repre&s;ented them to the King, as dangerous to
the Republick, by rea&s;on of the great number of
Pea&s;ants, that daily ran over to them; it was re|&s;olved,
That the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> General, <HI>Koniespolski,</HI> &s;hould
order a Fort to be erected at a certain Point of
Land, called <HI>Kudak,</HI> where the River <HI>Zwamer</HI>
falls into the <HI>Bori&s;thenes,</HI> which for its Situation,
they had cho&s;en as a convenient Place to bridle the
<HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> as being not far di&s;tant from the place of
<PB N="123" REF="69">
their ordinary Rendezvouz. The <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> who
were not &s;o &s;imple as not to penetrate into the De|&s;ign
of the <HI>Poles,</HI> re&s;olved not to &s;uffer the Bridle to
be put over their Heads, and having defeated Coll.
<HI>Marion,</HI> who was left there with 200 Men, to &s;ee the
Fort perfected, they a&s;&s;embled a con&s;iderable Bo|dy,
to prevent the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> General in his De&s;ign.
But at the very juncture of time, when they &s;hould
have been mo&s;t unanimous, great Divi&s;ions ari&s;ing
among the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> they revolted again&s;t their Ge|neral,
<HI>Sawakonowiez,</HI> whom they Ma&s;&s;acr'd, and in
his Place &s;et up one <HI>Pauluck,</HI> of little Experience,
and le&s;s Conduct in Martial Affairs; The <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Ge|neral
having in the mean while taken this Oppor|tunity,
to put the Fort in a &s;tate of Defence, they
marched out under their new General <HI>Pauluck;</HI>
but were &s;urpri&s;ed in the Plains near <HI>Kor&s;un,</HI> be|fore
they could Entrench them&s;elves betwixt their
Waggons, according to their Cu&s;tom, &s;o that be|ing
de&s;titute of Hor&s;e, they were ea&s;ily Defeated
by <HI>Potoski<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Mar&s;hal <HI>de Camp.</HI> Tho&s;e that
&s;aved them&s;elves by flight, got into <HI>Borovits,</HI> but
being immediately be&s;ieged by <HI>Potoski,</HI> and the
Place being not provided with Ammunition, they
were obliged to &s;urrender their General, <HI>Pauluck,</HI>
with four more of their Principal Officers, who were
afterwards beheaded at <HI>War&s;aw,</HI> notwith&s;tanding
their Lives were &s;ecured to them by the Capitulation.
It was al&s;o decreed at the Dyet, held at the &s;ame
time at <HI>War&s;aw,</HI> that not only all their Priviledges,
and the City of <HI>Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">htimoravia,</HI> granted to them
by King <HI>Stephen,</HI> &s;hould be taken from them, but
al&s;o a new Body of Militia &s;hould be erected in
their &s;tead. But the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> being not di&s;couraged
at this Re&s;olution, re&s;olved al&s;o on their Side, to
try the utmo&s;t for the Recovery of their Liberty;
and after having prote&s;ted to the <HI>Poles,</HI> that they
would remain &s;teadfa&s;t to the Intere&s;t of that Crown,
provided they were maintain'd in their antient Pri|viledges,
they fought a &s;econd time with <HI>Potoski,</HI> in
the <HI>Vkraine,</HI> but with not much better Succe&s;s than
<PB N="124" REF="70">
before; &s;o that finding their Circum&s;tances de&s;perate,
they Entrench'd them&s;elves on the other &s;ide
of the <HI>Bori&s;thenes,</HI> upon the River <HI>Statcza,</HI> where,
during the &s;pace of two Months, the <HI>Poles</HI> attack'd
them at &s;everal times with great Vigour, but were
as often repul&s;ed with all the Bravery imaginable;
&s;o that, finding there was no good to be done with
the&s;e de&s;perate <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> they were forced to come
to a Capitulation with them, and to confirm all
their former Privileges, and to promi&s;e the Re-e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of their Militia upon the &s;ame Foot as
before, under the Command of their own Gene|ral
cho&s;en by the King. But this Capitulation was
almo&s;t as &s;oon broken as made; For, no &s;ooner
had they cajoled the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> out of their advanta|gious
Po&s;t, but mo&s;t of them were either cut to
pieces or plunder'd by the <HI>Poles.</HI> Their Militia
was not re-e&s;tabli&s;h'd, but another &s;et up in their
&s;tead, where no <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> were permitted to enroll
them&s;elves. But &s;carce two Years were elap&s;ed,
before the <HI>Poles</HI> had &s;ufficient Occa&s;ion to repent
them&s;elves of this Change. For the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who
before the Reform of the&s;e <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> never dur&s;t &s;o
much as approach the&s;e Frontiers, made a great Irru|ption
into the <HI>Vkraine,</HI> and after having ruin'd all with
Fire and Sword, in the Tertitories of <HI>Perea&s;law, Cor|fun,</HI>
and <HI>Wi&s;nowitz,</HI> return'd home with a va&s;t Booty,
and a great Number of Pri&s;oners, according to their
wonted Cu&s;tom. <HI>Ladi&s;laus,</HI> therefore then King of
<HI>Poland,</HI> having duely weighed the Nece&s;&s;ity there
was, to keep on foot this Body, upon which he
much relied, e&s;pecially at that time, when he was
likely to be engag'd in a heavy War again&s;t the
<HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> effectually re&s;tored them to
their former Condition, having given them for
their General, one <HI>Bogdan</HI> (or <HI>Theodore) Chmielni&s;|ki.</HI>
But a great many of the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Nobility ha|ving
conceiv'd a mortal Hatred again&s;t the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI>
mi&s;s'd no Opportunity of doing them what Mi&s;|chief
they could; Among the re&s;t, a certain
<HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Gentleman, who&s;e Name was <HI>Jarinski,</HI> did
<PB N="125" REF="70">
not only burn &s;ome Mills belonging to the General
of the <HI>Co&s;acks, Chmielniski;</HI> but al&s;o, after having
ravi&s;h'd his Wife, killed both her and her Son.
<HI>Chmielniski,</HI> being provok'd to revenge &s;o barbarous
an Affront, after having demanded Satisfaction,
which was denied him, &s;tirred up his <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> who
with burning, plundering, and ravi&s;hing conti|nually
pe&s;tered the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Nobility; &s;o that they
addre&s;s'd them&s;elves to King <HI>John Ca&s;imir,</HI> Brother
of the decea&s;ed King <HI>Ladi&s;laus,</HI> de&s;iring him to
march again&s;t them in Per&s;on, which he having
refu&s;ed to do, they brought together an Army of
50000 Men, but were mi&s;erably beaten by the <HI>Co|&s;acks;</HI>
and having a &s;econd time encountred them
without the King's con&s;ent, they received another
Overthow. To revenge this, they watch'd their
Opportunity, when <HI>Chmielniski</HI> was celebrating the
Nuptials of his Son with the Daughter of the
Prince of <HI>Moldavia;</HI> the <HI>Poles</HI> then &s;urpri&s;ed the
<HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> plunder'd the City, and took the <HI>Grecian</HI>
Patriarch Pri&s;oner. The General having &s;ent to
the King to know whether it were done by his Or|ders?
was an&s;wered no; but that the Nobility had
done it to revenge them&s;elves upon the <HI>Co&s;acks.
Chmielniski,</HI> being vehemently incens'd again&s;t the
Nobility, entred into a League with the <HI>Tartars,</HI>
and entring <HI>Poland</HI> with a va&s;t Army, the King
march'd again&s;t him in Per&s;on at the Head of a
Hundred thou&s;and Men; The Battle was fought
near the City of <HI>Bere&s;tesko,</HI> on the River <HI>Ster,</HI> where
both the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> were entirely routed,
though they were almo&s;t three to one &s;tronger
than the <HI>Poles.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding which, their Ge|neral
<HI>Chmielniski,</HI> who e&s;caped after the Battle, ha|ving
re-a&s;&s;embled the Remainders of his broken
Army, &s;o continually hara&s;&s;ed the neighbouring
Country, that the King thought it mo&s;t convenient
to come to an Agreement with them in the Year
1651. But the mo&s;t of the Nobility being di&s;&s;a|tisfied
with the King's Proceedings, did let &s;lip no
Opportunity that offered it &s;elf, to affront the
<PB N="126" REF="71">
<HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> but e&s;pecially their General <HI>Chmielniski,</HI>
which obliged them about two years after, to wit,
in the Year 1653. to join with the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> who
with their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, took in the Year nex follow|ing
the City of <HI>Smolensko</HI> and <HI>Vilna;</HI> &s;o, that it was
chiefly owing to their Valour, that the <HI>Mu&s;|covites</HI>
got into the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Provinces of
<HI>Smolensko,</HI> and <HI>Severia,</HI> and the greate&s;t part of
the Palatinate of <HI>Kiovia,</HI> which were confirmed to
them by the Treaty of Peace, made at <HI>Oliva,</HI> in
the Year 1666. About which time the greate&s;t

of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> the re&s;t under the <HI>Turks,</HI>
whereby they opened the way to the latter into the

<HI>Poles.</HI></P>
<P>Out of what has been related concerning the
<HI>Co&s;acks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Retreating Place of the <HI>Co|&s;acks.</HI></NOTE> it is &s;ufficiently manife&s;t, that they were a
certain Body of Soldiers, E&s;tabli&s;hed for the

in the Provinces of the <HI>Poli&s;h Ru&s;&s;ia, Volinia</HI> and
<HI>Podolia;</HI> and had originally but one City belonging
to them, which was the Re&s;idence of their Go|vernour

Rocks, lying &s;o clo&s;e together, that they &s;eem to be

opportunity from the Inhabitants of the <HI>&V;kraine,</HI>
to Tran&s;port their Wheat, and other Commodities,
which grow there in great abundance, to <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople,</HI>

<HI>Black-Sea,</HI> as the Knights of <HI>Maltha</HI> are obliged to
&s;erve on Board their Gallies, before they are re|ceived

<P>The fir&s;t thing they do,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they go upon their Ex|pedition<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> after they have met here,
is to chu&s;e their General, who is to Command in the

to work on their Ships, which they make them|&s;elves,
being about three&s;core Foot long, and a|bout
ten or twelve broad, very &s;lightly built, every
one having its Oars, &s;ome ten, others twelve, and
&s;ometimes fifteen or &s;ixteen. Their Sails are very
wretched, notwith&s;tanding which, by the help of
their Oars, which they mo&s;t rely on, they far ex|ceed

<PB N="128" REF="72">
any in the North, neverthele&s;s, when they go upon
any Expedition, either by Sea or Land, they are the
Sobre&s;t people in the World. When they are going to

or &s;ix thou&s;and Men, and there being commonly
three&s;core at a time employed in building each Ship,
they will get four&s;core or a hundred of them ready
to be launched in three Weeks time. Fifty or Sixty
of them belong to each Ship, which has on board
five or &s;ix Falconets, each of the Men being
provided with a couple of Fu&s;ees, and Powder, and
Ball proportionable; They always &s;tay for the la&s;t
Quarter of the Moon, that at their going out they
may not be di&s;covered by the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Gallies, which
are always ready in the Harbour of <HI>Oczakow,</HI> a City
&s;ituate at the Mouth of the <HI>Bori&s;thenes,</HI> to ob&s;erve
their Motion. No &s;ooner have they got the lea&s;t

<P>When they de&s;cry a Ship or Gally, which they
can do at a great di&s;tance without being perceived
by them, their Ve&s;&s;els not baring above two Foot
and an half above Water, they approach to it as
near as they think convenient, towards the Evening;
when keeping at about three or four Miles di&s;tance,
they take exactly notice whereabouts the Ship is,
and what Cour&s;e it takes; About Midnight they get
to their Oars, and, with all the ha&s;te they can,
make towards the Place where they think it mo&s;t
likely to meet with the Ship; which being found
out, they &s;urround, attack, and board it on all
&s;ides, &s;o that it being impo&s;&s;ible for one Ship to de|fend
<PB N="129" REF="72">
it &s;elf in the Night-time again&s;t &s;o many, it is
&s;oon taken. What Booty they meet with, either of Sil|ver,
Cannon or Arms, or &s;uch Merchandices as are
of no great Burthen, they tran&s;port into their Ve&s;&s;els,
but the Ship they generally &s;ink. But as they have
the Advantage over the Ships or Gallies by Night,
&s;o, if they happen to meet them by Day, they &s;el|dom
come off without bloody No&s;es, they being
not in a Condition to with&s;tand their Cannon. It is
then their Swiftne&s;s &s;tands them mo&s;t in &s;tead, and
they are &s;ecure enough from the Enemy's pur&s;u|ing,
when once they approach their little Channels,
and get among the Bulru&s;hes. Whil&s;t they were

<P>But,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Manner of Fighting by Land.</NOTE> as to their manner of Fighting by Land, it's to be
ob&s;erv'd, that they are but very indifferent Hor&s;emen,

to all &s;orts of Fatigues and Hard&s;hip, very o|bedient
to their Commanders, and extreamly active
and dexterous in intrenching them&s;elves, not only
in the ordinary Way, but al&s;o by making a Fence

The&s;e moving Entrenchments are ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary

but e&s;pecially very active; they are Liberal,
even to Profu&s;ene&s;s, putting no great value upon
Riches, but are great lovers of their Liberty,
which they look upon as a thing ine&s;timable; they
are Indefatigable, hardy, and brave; but great

as being peculiar to that Nation, which in

attacqu'd by this Evil, lo&s;e all upon a &s;udden,
the U&s;e of their Limbs, and are tortured with mo&s;t
horrible Pains all over their Body, which common|ly
continues for a whole Year; after which, a
Sweat coming, which continues for a whole Night;
but e&s;pecially in the Head, their Hair is the next
Morning all twi&s;ted together into one knotty Lock,
which has a very nau&s;eous Smell, (from whence
&s;ome attribute the fir&s;t U&s;e of Hair-Powder, to
the <HI>Poles)</HI> but in a few days after, they are cured
both of their Lamene&s;s and Pain, but the Knot and
the Smell remain for ever; for if they cut it off,
the Remnants of the Humour, which purges it &s;elf
that way through the Pores of the Head, falls upon
the Eyes, and makes them blind. This Di&s;temper
is as familiar in <HI>Poland,</HI> as the Itch in &s;ome Coun|tries,
and what is wor&s;e, is very Infectious; It is
&s;ometimes, like the Venereal Di&s;ea&s;e, communi|cated
by Coition; there having been In&s;tances, that
Children have brought this Di&s;temper with them
<PB N="133" REF="74">
into the World, but as they grow up, it decrea&s;es
by degrees, and never returns afterwards. It is
look'd upon among them as incurable, except it be
by changing the Air, which mu&s;t be done by going
into another Country: The Cau&s;e of this Di&s;tem|per
&s;eems to proceed from the great quantity of <HI>Ar|&s;enical</HI>
Mines, which are in <HI>Poland,</HI> and communi|cate
their poy&s;onous quality to the Waters, and con|&s;equently
to their Body; which &s;eems the more pro|bable,

Knot either in their Manes or foretop, of which, if
there be the lea&s;t part cut off, the Hor&s;e either dies,
runs mad, or becomes blind and lame; I have been
very credibly inform'd, that tho' the <HI>Poles</HI> look upon
this Evil as incurable, &s;everal Foreigners travelling
in tho&s;e Parts have cured it with good Succe&s;s, by
the &s;ame Method and Remedies, which are made
u&s;e of in the Venereal Di&s;temper; which &s;eems

they have not only much alter'd and transform'd,

Mr. <HI>Ludolph</HI> in his <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian Grammar,</HI> printed in the
Year 1696, at <HI>Oxford,</HI> has not only given a very
fair Delineation of them, but al&s;o treated with a
great deal of Exactne&s;s, the fundamental Parts of
this Language, and very methodically repre&s;ented
its Affinity with the <HI>Sclavonian;</HI> to which I refer
the Curious.</P>
<P>As to their Habits,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> Ha|bit.</NOTE> it is not unlike that of the
Antient <HI>Greeks,</HI> whom in this, as well as in &s;everal
other Re&s;pects, they are very ambitious to im|tate.
Their uppermo&s;t Garment is a long great
Robe, reaching down to their Feet, with very
narrow Sleeves, but as long as the Coat it &s;elf,
which, when they dre&s;s them&s;elves, they turn up in
&s;everal Pleats, and look upon it as a great Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">eli|ne&s;s&punc;
In the Winter they let them hang down, &s;o
that they &s;erve for a Muff; and &s;ometimes to co|ver
their ill De&s;igns; for when they intend to rob
or cudgel any body, they hide in them their Cud|gels
or Daggers. Per&s;ons of Quality have the&s;e
Robes of Sattin, Damask, or Cloth of Gold; Ci|tizens
wear them of Violet, or dark green Colour,
and &s;ometimes of red Cloth. The meaner Sort of
People, of a coar&s;e dark-colour'd Cloth, &s;uch as is
made in the Country. In the Winter they l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">e
them with Furrs, &s;ome with <HI>Sables,</HI> &s;ome with <HI>Er|mins,</HI>
others with <HI>Martens,</HI> or &s;ome other &s;ort, ac|cording
to their &s;everal Qualities; but the Poor
People are contented with Sheep-Skin, which tho'
very convenient for keeping off the Cold, yet ca&s;ts
out a Smell that is very offen&s;ive to the No&s;trils.
The&s;e Robes they wear only when they go abroad,
over all the re&s;t of their Cloaths, and are as to their
Fa&s;hion the &s;ame with tho&s;e kept in the Grand
Duke's Wardrobe, for the U&s;e of his <HI>Boyars,</HI> by
whom he is attended at publick Ceremonies. Un|der
this they wear a clo&s;e Coat, and under that a
Wa&s;tcoat. The clo&s;e Coat is called <HI>Feres,</HI> which
comes down to the Calf of their Legs, open before,
with a very broad Collar falling down upon the
<PB N="136" REF="76">
Shoulders, with Gold or Silver Loop-Buttons, nay,
&s;ometimes Embroidery from the top to the bottom&punc;
and on the &s;ide. The Sleeves like tho&s;e of their
Upper Garments, being as long as the Coat it &s;elf,
but very Narrow. The Wa&s;tcoats which they call
<HI>Kaftan,</HI> comes down to their Knees, the Sleeves are
likewi&s;e &s;o long that they cannot thru&s;t out their
Hands without making Folds upon the Arm; The
Collars of the&s;e Wa&s;tcoats are almo&s;t like tho&s;e of
the <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> but much higher, covering the hinder
part of the Head, about half a quarter of a Yard
high. The&s;e Wa&s;tcoats, as well as the Ju&s;telau-Corps,
are made either of Callico, Taffata, Damask, or
Sattin, according to the &s;everal Qualities and Circum|&s;tances
of tho&s;e that wear them. And becau&s;e the
Collar of the Wa&s;tcoat, is, by rea&s;on of its Height,
very con&s;picuous, they either line it with Velvet, or
Cloth of Gold, and &s;ometimes adorn it with Pearls
and precious Stones. Their Breeches are pretty
large, and gathered at the Wa&s;te, &s;o that they may be
made &s;treighter and wider as they plea&s;e. Their Shirts
which they wear over their Drawers or Breeches,
girded under the Navel, are very wide, but &s;hort,
&s;carce covering their Thighs; they are not gathered
at the Neck like ours, but &s;trengthned behind by a
triangular Piece, which comes down from the
&s;houlders to the Reins, and is &s;ow'd down with
Crim&s;on Silk; tho&s;e that are more curious than the
re&s;t, have little Fringes of Silk of the &s;ame Colour in
the Seams, and under their Arm-pits. The Vanity of
the richer Sort reaches yet further; for they have
their Neck and Wri&s;t-bands, and where it is open at
the Brea&s;t, embroider'd with Silk, Gold and Silver,
and &s;ometimes with Pearls and precious Stones; and
they leave open their Wa&s;tcoats before, that the
Embroidery and the Buttons of Gold, or Pearls, which
fa&s;ten the Shirt before, may be &s;een. The <HI>Mu&s;co|vites</HI>
wear no Hats, but, in&s;tead of them, Caps or
Bonnets, with a little Snip open before and behind,
to the form almo&s;t of a Pyramid, but not &s;o much
peaked, near half an Ell high. The <HI>Boyars</HI> when
<PB N="137" REF="76">
they are pre&s;ent at any Publick Ceremonies have
them of black Fox-Skins or Sables; but when they
are ab&s;ent from Court, or in their Hou&s;es, they
wear them of Velvet lined with the&s;e Furrs, with
narrow Brims (mo&s;t like the <HI>Polonian</HI> Bonnets,
which are worn by mo&s;t Strangers in <HI>Mu&s;covy)</HI> and
laid over with Gold and Silver Loops, or embroi|der'd
on the Sides with Pearl. The Poor People
wear in the Summer, White Felt or Cloth Caps,
patch'd together out of Shreds of Cloth, it being
very dear in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> of &s;everal Colours, which
in a manner re&s;emble a <HI>Jack Pudding</HI>'s Cap, which
they line with the vile&s;t &s;ort of Fur they can get,
in the Winter; They are not near &s;o convenient as
our Hats; for having no Brims, they don't afford
the &s;ame protection again&s;t the Sun, Wind, or foul
Weather. Their Boots, which generally they wear
in&s;tead of Shooes, are &s;hort like tho&s;e worn by the
<HI>Polanders,</HI> and piked towards the Toes. But the
poor Pea&s;ant is his own Shoomaker; his Shooes he
makes of the Bark of a Tree wrought very thin,
and interwoven after the manner of Wicker-basket;
&s;o that it is true beyond Contradiction, that no
Country in the World has &s;uch a Number of Shoo|makers
as <HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> As for Stockings they are ne|ver
regarded, among the&s;e poor Wretches, a piece
of Sheep-Skin or Cloth wrapt about their Legs and
tied fa&s;t with a Packthread, &s;upplies the defect of
them; the re&s;t of their Garments, which are of
the coar&s;e&s;t Canva&s;s, being &s;uitable to their Shooes and
Stockings. Per&s;ons of the fir&s;t Rank &s;have their
Heads, except when they are under &s;ome Di&s;grace
with the Grand Czar, when they let their Hair grow
and hang carele&s;ly over their Shoulders, as a Token
of their Affliction, in imitation of the Antient
<HI>Greeks.</HI> Tho&s;e of a lower Condition keep their
Hair cut &s;hort; but the Prie&s;ts wear it very long,
hanging down to the middle of their Backs. There
is no great difference betwixt the Mens Habits and
the Women; There is no &s;trife here for the Breeches,
for the Wife wears them as well as the Husband,
<PB N="138" REF="77">
as they do in all other re&s;pects wear the &s;ame with
the Men. Their Robes are the &s;ame but &s;omething
wider, and the Sleeves are not &s;o clo&s;ely fa&s;tned to
them, but that they either may keep in or put out
their Arms at plea&s;ure, and let the Sleeves hang by;
The richer Sort lay them all over with very thick
Gold and Silver Lace, or trim them Button and
Loop Fa&s;hion. They don't u&s;e the&s;e High Collars,
which the Men e&s;teem as a &s;ingular Ornament; be|&s;ides
that their Smock Sleeves are prodigiou&s;ly long,
generally four or five Ells, which they pleat in lit|tle
Folds upon the Arm; and the Heels of their
Shooes are half a quarter of a Yard high. The
main difference is in their Head-dre&s;s. For they
wear very wide Caps or Coifs of Damask or Sattin,
made after a very fanta&s;tical Way; the Hair of the Ca&s;ters
wherewith they are lined covering all the Forehead,
the out&s;ide being &s;ometimes very richly embroider'd.
Maids that are marriageable wear them of Cloth
lined with Fox-Skin, and let their Hair hang down
their Backs in two Tre&s;&s;es, which they tye at the
End with a piece of Crim&s;on Silk Ribband; but
the married Women put up their Hair under their
Caps or Coifs. Children under the Age of Ten
Years are not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed in their Habits;
both Boys and Girls have their Hair cut clo&s;e to
their Heads, except two &s;hort Locks almo&s;t like
Mu&s;tachio's, which are left to cover the Temples;
only the Girls wear Rings of Gold, Silver or Bra&s;s
in their Ears. The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> keep very con&s;tant
to the &s;ame Fa&s;hion; it being rarely to be &s;een
that any of them make u&s;e of a Foreign Dre&s;s
unle&s;s it be &s;ometimes a Per&s;on of Quality, who
taking a particular Fancy to Strangers, perhaps
makes u&s;e of their Fa&s;hion when he goes in the
Country, or a Hunting. Formerly all Foreigners
of what Degree &s;oever, u&s;ed to go in <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI>
Habits, till about fifty Years ago, the Patriarch ha|ving
ob&s;erved &s;ome of them to ridicule their Cere|monies
when he gave the Benediction to the People,
prevail'd with the Grand Czar to forbid all Strangers
<PB N="139" REF="77">
living in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> to appear for the future in <HI>Mu&s;|covian</HI>
Habits; but of late Years, they Cloath them|&s;elves
again after the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are of a middle Seize as to their
Stature, &s;trong proportioned, of the &s;ame colour as
the other <HI>Europaeans</HI> in the Northern Parts. But they
much affect Corpulency, e&s;pecially among Per&s;ons
of Quality. Long Beards, and great Mu&s;tachio's
are in great reque&s;t among them, which they look
upon as tokens of Virility. So that a large Belly and
a great deal of Hair about the Mouth (for upon
their Heads they were little or none) are con&s;idered
here as peculiar Ornaments belonging to a
Man.</P>
<P>The Women in <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> are of a midling Stature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mu&s;covi|an <HI>Women.</HI></NOTE>
neither too tall nor too little, and generally well
proportion'd before they are married, but after
they have had &s;everal Children, inclining to Fat|ne&s;s,
by rea&s;on they do not keep their Bodies &s;o
&s;treight as our Ladies in the&s;e Parts, it being look'd
upon rather as a Comeline&s;s than an Imperfection.
The Features of their Faces are not de&s;pi&s;able, and
a great many among them might pa&s;s for very
Hand&s;om in any part of <HI>Europe,</HI> were it not for that
prepo&s;terous Cu&s;tom received among all the Women
of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> of what Age or degree &s;oever, of
Painting their Faces, Necks and Hands. The wor&s;t
of all is, that having not attained to any kind of
Perfection in this Art, they paint &s;o gros&s;ly, that it
appears no otherwi&s;e than if it had been done by a
Plai&s;terer; and notwith&s;tanding this; whereas in other
places, Women make u&s;e of it as an Addition to their
Beauty, or a Concealment of their Deformity, a
great many of the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Ladies, may very well
be &s;aid, to u&s;e it as a Veil to their Beauty; Pain|ting
being &s;o univer&s;ally approved in this Country
that the Bridegrooms, among other Pre&s;ents, &s;end
it to their Brides, as we &s;hall &s;ee anon, before we
conclude this Chapther. Be&s;ides which, they have
another Cu&s;tom, which will perhaps appear as odd
as the former; which is, that they are as careful,
<PB N="140" REF="78">
and take as much pains in making their Teeth black,
as our Ladies do in keeping of them white, they
e&s;teeming black Teeth an addition to their Com|plexion,
with the &s;ame Intention, as our Ladies

their Gue&s;ts, even among People of the be&s;t Qua|lity,

are not the only People in the World, which
are intoxicated by the force of &s;trong Liquor, the
very &s;ame is practi&s;ed in <HI>Germany,</HI> where the Ma&s;ter or

not think the Entertainment compleat, if they go
home without Staggering. And as to what con|cerns
the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Ladies, it is po&s;&s;ible their merry
Meetings may meet with a favourable Con&s;truction
from &s;uch of our Ladies, as prefer the Charms of
Di&s;till'd Waters, before Wine. Be&s;ides, that the
fair Sex in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> have a &s;trong Plea to Alledge in
their own Defence: For as much as the great Quanti|ty
of Fi&s;h they eat on their Fa&s;t-days, which make
up above half the Year, requires certain Dige&s;tives
to attenuate the Vi&s;co&s;ity of this Dyet; and, that,
the merry Cup makes them, in &s;ome mea&s;ure an
Amends for the &s;olitary Life they lead at Home,
under the mo&s;t rigid Di&s;cipline of their Hurbands,
of which, we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak more
hereafter. On the other hand, it is mo&s;t certain,
that the meaner Sort of People commit intolerable
exce&s;&s;es in this kind; for they will drink not only
till they can neither &s;tand nor go, but oftentimes
till they die upon the Spot. To &s;pend every <HI>Cope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>
(or Penny) they have, in a Tippling-Hou&s;e, is a
common thing here; and thus far they may per|haps
be match'd as well in this Kingdom, as &s;ome
others in <HI>Europe;</HI> but nothing is more frequent in
<HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> among the vulgar Sort, than to come
away without their Cloaths, nay, it often happens,
that if they come away with their Wa&s;tcoats on,
and meet one of their drunken Companions by the
way, they return, and &s;end thus, Stockins, Wa&s;te|coat,
Shirts and Drawers, after the re&s;t, and re|turn

home like <HI>Adamites.</HI> It is ea&s;ie to be imagin|ed,
that there is no Mi&s;chief &s;o great, no Vice &s;o
abominable, but what is committed by the&s;e Drunk|ards,
who, even when &s;ober, very &s;eldom act ac|cording
to the dictates of Rea&s;on. Hence it is,
that &s;o many Murthers are committed in the Streets
of the City of <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> &s;o that it is un&s;afe to go
alone, or unarm'd in the Night-time, there
being &s;ometimes fifteen dead Bodies to be &s;een to|gether
in the Court of <HI>Semskay,</HI> a place where
they are expo&s;ed, that their Friends and Kindred
may take care for their Burial. If no body owns
them, they are thrown &s;ome where or another in a
Ditch. From hence al&s;o proceed the&s;e frequent Ir|regularities,
Di&s;orders and Exce&s;&s;es in Debauche|ries,
even to &s;in again&s;t the Cour&s;e of Nature, not
only with Men, but al&s;o with Bea&s;ts. The Wo|men
of the meaner Sort, tho' otherwi&s;e kept un|der
a very &s;trict Di&s;cipline, will often find out
their Husbands at the Tippling-Hou&s;e, and drink
with them to that Exce&s;s, till they can neither
&s;tand nor go, and are obliged to lay down among
them at the Tippling-Hou&s;e. Several of the
Great Dukes have attempted to put a &s;top to this
Evil, by ordering &s;uch Publick-hou&s;es as were al|low'd
of by their Authority, to &s;ell their Liquor
only by certain Mea&s;ures at a time; but this prov'd
ineffectual, the Neighbours meeting by turns at

<P>Formerly Tobacco was as extravagantly taken,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tobacco forbidden.</NOTE>

Be&s;ides (which made the Patriarch take a particu|lar

having the Liberty to u&s;e it, makes the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI>
often venture upon it in their Company; they be|ing
&s;o eager of Tobacco, that the mo&s;t ordinary
Sort, which formerly co&s;t not above 9 or 10 Pence
<HI>per</HI> Pound in <HI>England,</HI> they will buy at the rate of
fourteen or fifteen Shillings; and, if they want
Money, they will truck their Cloaths for it, to the
very Shirt. They take it after a mo&s;t bea&s;tly man|ner,
in&s;tead of Pipes, they have an Engine made
of a Cows-horn, in the middle of which, there is
a Hole, where they place the Ve&s;&s;el that holds the
Tobacco. The Ve&s;&s;el is commonly made of Wood,
pretty wide, and indifferently deep; which, when
they have fill'd with Tobacco, they put Water in|to
the Horn to temper the Smoak. They common|ly
light their Pipe with a Firebrand, &s;ucking the
Smoak through the Horn with &s;o much Greedine&s;s,
that they empty the Pipe at two or three Sucks;
when they whiff it out of the Mouth, their ri&s;es
&s;uch a Cloud, that it hides both their Faces and the
Standers by. Being debarr'd from the con&s;tant u&s;e
of it, they fall down drunk, and in&s;en&s;ible im|mediately
after, for half a quarter of an Hour,
when the Tobacco having had its Operation, they
lep up in an in&s;tant, more brisk and lively than
before, when their fir&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e commonly tends
to the prai&s;e of Tobacco, and e&s;pecially of its

differing in degrees of Heat, which are
cho&s;en by every one according to his own Conve|niency.
Upon one of the&s;e Benches they lay

Pre&s;ervation of their Health, which being thus from

Citizens, or Pea&s;ants, when they appear before
their Magi&s;trates or the Nobility, bow to the very
Ground, pro&s;trating them&s;elves and beating their
Foreheads to the Ground; The &s;ame Reverence is
paid to the Czar, even by the greate&s;t Men in the
Kingdom. This extraordinary Re&s;pect paid by
the Commonalty to the Nobles makes them appear
&s;o extreamly haughty and jealous of their Autho|rity,
that Strangers, tho' of the fir&s;t Quality, rarely
meet with that Civility they might rea&s;onably claim

<P>Their manner of Travelling is extreamly com|modious,
e&s;pecially in the Winter, when their
Sleds glide away on the &s;urface of the Ice or Snow
in a flat Country, with incredible Swiftne&s;s, and
very little Inconveniency to the Hor&s;es, &s;o that
they will travel 50 or 60 Miles a day. The&s;e Sleds
are made of the Bark of the Linden-tree, fitted to
the length and breadth of a Man; they line them
with &s;ome thick Felt, and when a Man is laid in
<PB N="154" REF="85">
them along, he is covered and wrapt up over Head
and Ears in good Furs: The Carter runs, for the
mo&s;t part, by the Sled, to warm him&s;elf, and
&s;ometimes &s;its at the Feet of the Per&s;on that rides
in the Sleds, where he is &s;ure to comfort him&s;elf
with a Drachm of the Bottle. The&s;e Sleds being
very low built, if they happen to over-turn, are
not very dangerous. The Ladies Sleds, being co|vered
on all &s;ides, in the Fa&s;hion of a Coach, are
much higher and heavier, and therefore more dan|gerous.
Whil&s;t they travel thus, the Time is pa&s;t
away, for the mo&s;t part, with Sleeping, the ea&s;ie
and in&s;en&s;ible motion favouring the Repo&s;e of the
Traveller. When they happen to pa&s;s through De|&s;arts
and great Fore&s;ts, where they are obliged to
remain all Night in the open Air, they kindle a great
Fire, and round about it range their Sleds; &s;o, that
being well clos'd up on all &s;ides, and covered
all over with Furs, they &s;leep more commodiou&s;ly,
than in a Country Cottage, where Men and Bea&s;ts
being all together lodged in one Room, greatly
di&s;turb a Man's re&s;t. In the Summer they travel
either by Water upon the Rivers, wherewith this
Country is &s;tor'd every where, or el&s;e by Land, on
Hor&s;eback, by Coach or Waggon, the Roads in
<HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> being very broad, beautiful and ea&s;ie for
Travelling. By Water they make u&s;e of certain little
Boats, made all of one Piece, of the Trunk of a
Tree made hollow, in which they &s;tand upright,
and row over the Lakes and Rivers. The&s;e Boats
being very light, a Man goes a great way in them in
a little time; but they have this Inonvenience, that
if not exactly counterpoiz'd, they &s;oon turn over.
They have al&s;o certain Floating Bridges, made of
pieces of Firr joyn'd together, which bear them|&s;elves
up upon the Water. The greate&s;t inconveni|ency
in Travelling here is, that in the Country
there are no Inns or Hou&s;es of Entertainment for
Travellers, &s;o that they are obliged to carry along
with them what Provi&s;ions and other Nece&s;&s;aries
they &s;tand in need of. Be&s;ides that, the violent
<PB N="155" REF="85">
Heat in the Summer, and the prodigious quantities
of Flyes, are very trouble&s;ome, and interrupt the
Plea&s;ure which a Stranger el&s;e might take in the
Beauty and Variety of their Fore&s;ts, Brooks and
Lakes.</P>
<P>Marriages is accounted honourable among them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ir Marri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|ges.</NOTE>
and Polygamy forbidden. They may Marry twice,
but to do it the third Time, is accounted Scanda|lous
and Immoral. They are very Super&s;titious in
ob&s;erving the degrees of Con&s;anguinity, and &s;el|dom
Marry tho&s;e that are any wi&s;e near to them by
Kindred or Alliance. Two Brothers are not per|mitted
to Marry two Si&s;ters, neither are God-fa|thers
and God-mothers to the &s;ame Per&s;on, to in|ter-marry.
There is no &s;uch thing as Wooing here
betwixt the young Couple, Gallantry and Court|&s;hip
the Preliminaries of Love, which in&s;en&s;ibly
in&s;inuate into the Mind, and captivate our Hearts,
are look'd upon here as Chymera's, Marriage being
con&s;idered as a nece&s;&s;ary Evil. Young Men and
Maids are not &s;uffered to &s;ee, much le&s;s to have
any Conver&s;ation with one another, &s;o, as to talk
of Marriage, or to be able to make the lea&s;t Pro|mi&s;e
by Word or Writing. It is tran&s;acted by way
of Brokeridge, &s;o that it is no difficult Matter to
put a Counterfeit upon the Bridegroom, provided
the Parents do but con&s;ent to it; in the &s;ame man|ner,
as <HI>Laban</HI> put the Bleer-ey'd <HI>Leah</HI> upon <HI>Jacob,</HI>
in&s;tead of the Beautiful <HI>Rebeckah,</HI> which is fre|quently
practi&s;ed in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> Their general way
of Proceeding is thus: If any one have a Marri|ageable
Daughter, whom he is willing to be&s;tow
upon a certain young Man he approves of, he ei|ther
by him&s;elf, or his Broker, declares his
Mind to the young Man's Parents, or for want of
them, to one of the next Kindred. If the Match
be accepted of, two or three Women, deputed by
him that is to be the Bridegroom, are permitted
to take a full view of the future Bride, &s;tark na|ked,
to &s;ee&punc; whether &s;he has any Defect; after
which, their Friends on both &s;ides treat of, and

to the Bridegroom's Hou&s;e, where the
Bed is made upon forty Sheaves of Rye, compa&s;&s;|ed

his Place at the Table, from whom the Bride|groom

up betwixt them by two young Lads. This done,

three times con&s;ecutively, <HI>Whether they are both &s;ides

&s;ent for, who comes with a Silver Cro&s;s, and have|ing

the young Couple are &s;et at the Table with a piece

Bed, the <HI>Suacha</HI> is very careful in exhorting the
Bride to be <HI>Debonair</HI> and <HI>Buxom,</HI> and the Bride|groom
not to deceive the Bride in her Expectati|on;
In the Interim, &s;he &s;tands at the Chamber-Door,
in expectation when the bu&s;ine&s;s is over;
which being done, &s;he carries the Tokens of Vir|ginity,
with a great deal of Joy to her Parents, and
the next day or two are &s;pent in Fea&s;ting and other
Jollities, which the Bridegroom endeavours to re|cover
<PB N="160" REF="88">
his lo&s;t Spirits out of the <HI>Aqua Vitae</HI> Cup, and
the Bride appears very chearful among her new
Friends, this being commonly the la&s;t Day of
Mirth for the poor Woman, unle&s;s what happy
Minutes &s;he can get by Stealth, at her Husband's
drunken Hours. To &s;peak without Partiality,
<HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> may well be called the Purgatory of the
Women, they being kept under &s;o rigorous a Di&s;|cipline
by their Husbands, that in &s;ome Places
Slaves be treated with much le&s;s Severity:
For, it is not &s;ufficient, that by their Eccle&s;ia&s;tical
Con&s;titutions they are debarr'd from Venery two
Days in a Week, <HI>viz. Mondays</HI> and <HI>Wedne&s;days,</HI>
be&s;ides, in Lent, and &s;ome other Fa&s;tings, which
make up near Eight Months in the Year; but Ab|&s;tinency
from their Wives and <HI>Aqua vitae</HI> is the
chief Penance laid upon the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Husbands by
their Prie&s;ts; &s;o that the Wife bearing the &s;ame Share
with her Husband for his Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, labours under
&s;uch Hard&s;hips as would &s;eem intolerable in other
Countries. If a married Woman happens to grant
a Friend in a Corner Kindne&s;s, &s;he is &s;ure, be&s;ides the
Hou&s;e-Di&s;cipline, to be &s;ent into a Mona&s;tery,
where &s;he is to &s;tay all her Life-time. The wor&s;t
of it is, that this Severity often furni&s;hes a Husband,
with a Pretence upon the lea&s;t Surmi&s;e, to rid
him&s;elf of his Wife, by &s;uborning of Witne&s;&s;es,
a thing frequently practis'd in tho&s;e Parts. If a
married Woman happen to have no Children by
her Husband, he has the Liberty of Per&s;wading,
and if that be not prevailing enough, of Cudgel|ling
her into a Mona&s;tery, where &s;he mu&s;t tarry all
her Life-time, for what, perhaps, was none of her
Fault, but the Husbands, who has the Liberty of
m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rrying again in &s;ix Weeks. But this is not all,
if the Husband is taken with a Fit of Devotion
(whether real or pretended, it matters not) of
leaving his Wife for God's &s;ake, as they term it,
which is as much in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> when a Man is
tir'd of his Wife, and maintaining his Family, he
has the Liberty, of going into a Mona&s;tery,
<PB N="161" REF="88">
without his Wifes Con&s;ent, or making any Provi|&s;ion
for his Children; where he has a pro&s;pect of be|coming,
perhaps, from a Mechanick, a Prie&s;t, if
his Wife marry again; this being the only Amends
the Wife has to make her &s;elf, if that may be ac|counted
an Amends, when they are forced to
leap (according to the old Proverb) <HI>Out of the Fry|ing-pan
into the Fire;</HI> for whenever they Marry a|gain,
they are &s;ure to meet with the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI>
Hou&s;e-Di&s;cipline, which is the Cudgel and the
Whip. It is &s;o general a Cu&s;tom in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> for a
Husband to cha&s;ti&s;e his Wife with the Whip, that
the Outcry's of a Woman upon &s;uch an Occa&s;ion,
are no more regarded, than we do a Correction
given to Children. They often u&s;ed to tye them
up, &s;tark naked, by the Hair of the Head, and &s;o
to whip them as long as they were able; Nay, there
have not been wanting Examples of Husband's
whipping their Wives to Death, upon Su&s;picion of
Adultery, without as much as being call'd to an
Account for it, they pretending to be exempt from
Puni&s;hment on the account of killing a Wife or
Slave, if it happen upon Correction. This barba|rous
Cu&s;tom has of late Years, however, been
much alter'd, if not quite aboli&s;hed, among Peo|ple
of Fa&s;hion, by the prudent Care of the Pa|rents,
who now a-days, to mitigate at lea&s;t the
Slavery of their Daughters, oblige their Husbands
in their Jointures, under con&s;iderable Forfeitures,
to find them with Cloaths, &s;uitable to their Quali|ties,
to feed them with good whole&s;om Meat, and
Drink, to u&s;e them kindly without Whipping,
Striking or Kicking; but the&s;e Contracts, as all
others, are &s;ometimes kept, &s;ometimes broken, the
General Cu&s;tom being a &s;trong Plea on the Hu&s;|band's
&s;ide; the be&s;t Comfort the poor Women have,
is that their Neighbours and Friends receive the &s;ame
Treatment. I know it has been alledged in be|half
of the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Hou&s;e-Di&s;cipline, that the
Women here have very lewd Tongues, will drink
a merry Cup of &s;trong Liquor, and upon an Occa|&s;ion
<PB N="162" REF="89">
not refu&s;e a Kindne&s;s to a Friend; but grant
this to be true, if the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> according to the
laudable Examples of other Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI>
would give their Children of both Sexes a more
generous Education, the Husbands would &s;hew
better Example and more Complai&s;ance to their
Wives; the&s;e Means would prove, without all
que&s;tion, more effectual than all their Whips and
Cudgels.</P>
<P>As to what concerns their Oeconomy and the Af|fairs
of their Hou&s;es in general,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Oe|conomy.</NOTE> it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed,
that it bears not the lea&s;t compari&s;on with
what is u&s;ual in the&s;e Parts; for the inferior Sort
live in wooden Hou&s;es, very low, and meanly
built, their Hou&s;hold Stuff con&s;i&s;ting commonly
in two or three Pots, and a few wooden or earthen
Di&s;hes. Some of the richer Sort make u&s;e of
Pewter, but what they have of it is very ill kept,
as is mo&s;t of their other Furniture, the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites</HI>
not making the lea&s;t account of Cleanline&s;s&punc;
and as for Plate, there is &s;carce any thing like it to
be &s;een, unle&s;s it be &s;ome few drinking Cups and
Goblets. Their Rooms, at the be&s;t are hung with
Mats, and adorned with two or three Images, paint|ed
after the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Fa&s;hion. As for their
Sleeping, they &s;trive not only to imitate, but al&s;o
to out-do the antient Inhabitants of <HI>Capua;</HI> for
tho&s;e would not allow their Children any Beds;

and the Poor meanly in their Diet; they know
no Superfluity but Drink, which they will pur|cha&s;e,

<P>Their ordinary Drink is a &s;ort of &s;mall <HI>Hydromel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Quas.</NOTE>
which they call <HI>Quas;</HI> This they make of Honey-combs,
which they beat in warm Water, &s;tirring it

Water, or &s;ometimes in <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> till it has ex|tracted
the Colour and Ta&s;tes of the Fruit. Into
this they put the pure&s;t Honey, to every Pound
three or four Pounds of Water, according as they
would have it &s;trong; Into this they put a Toa&s;t
dipp'd in the Dregs of Beer, which, as &s;oon as
the <HI>Hydromel</HI> begins to work, they take out again.
When it has done working, they either keep it up|on
or without the Lees, according as they either
intend to keep it or to &s;pend it immediately; And
to give it a plea&s;ant Flavour, they put into it &s;ome|times
a little bag of Cinnamon and Grains of Para|di&s;e,
with a few Cloves. But their main Liquor is
<HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> made out of Corn, which tho' very
&s;trong here, however they &s;ometimes fortifie
with Pepper. Of this they drink a Dram before
and after Dinner, and at any other time when they
intend to make them&s;elves merry.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons of Quality, and rich Merchants, have of
late Years built them&s;elves Hou&s;es of Brick and
Stone; they lie upon Beds or Quilts, have Tape&s;try
and other Hangings, and the re&s;t of their Hou&s;hold-&s;tuff
is &s;uitable to their Quality, yet not to that
Degree of Politene&s;s as is u&s;ual in the&s;e Parts. As
for their Diet, they don't only u&s;e all &s;orts of Meats
and Fowls, but e&s;pecially by rea&s;on of their fre|quent
Fa&s;ts, have great Variety of Di&s;hes of all
&s;orts of Fi&s;h, Herbs, and Pul&s;e. Among the re&s;t
they have one Di&s;h, which they make u&s;e of after
a drunken Bout, and has a very &s;avoury Ta&s;te. They
take cold roa&s;ted Veal, which they mince, but not
very &s;mall, with &s;ome pickl'd Cucumers, to this
they put good &s;tore of Vinegar, Pepper, and
the Liquor of pickl'd Cucumers, and recom|mend
it as a good Pre&s;ervative again&s;t the
Head-ach ari&s;ing from hard Drinking; fora&s;much as
they believe it di&s;pells the Vapours ri&s;ing into the
Head out of the Stomach. The Cellars of Per|&s;ons

other &s;orts of &s;trong Wines; (for the <HI>Rhini&s;h</HI> and
<HI>French</HI> Wines are in no great e&s;teem among them,
as being not &s;trong enough.) They brew their
&s;trong Beer, as we do, in <HI>March,</HI> and to keep it
cool, (their Cellars not being vaulted) during the
Heat of the Summer they make a Bed of Ice and
Snow mix'd tog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ther, and then a Layer of Bar|rels,

a Row of Barrels, which they cover with
Straw and Planks, which &s;erves for a Vault. They
are very Splendid in their Cloaths and Equipage,
being attended by a great Number of Slaves, all
which however they do without any great Expence,
for a&s;much as what Provi&s;ions they want for them|&s;elves

in the Country; and as for tho&s;e Slaves they enter|tain
in the City, they allow them Board-Wages,
but &s;o &s;cantily that they can &s;carce live upon it.
This is one of the chiefe&s;t Cau&s;es that &s;o many
Riots and Murthers are committed in the Streets of
the City of <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> and, that in Hay-making time
the Roads leading to this City are &s;o un&s;afe to tra|vel,
there being about that time &s;o great a Number
of Slaves abroad working in the Fields. Per&s;ons
of Quality and the riche&s;t Merchants in <HI>Mu&s;co</HI>
keep for this Rea&s;on a Guard in their Courts, who
watch all Night, and are to knock every hour with
a Stick upon a Board,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Interr|ments.</NOTE> as many Knocks at a time
as the Clock has &s;truck Hours.</P>
<P>They are very Ceremonious in their Interrments.
No &s;ooner is the &s;ick Per&s;on departed, but all the
Kindred and Friends come and &s;tand about the
Body, making mo&s;t horrid Out-cries&punc; and Lamen|tations.
They ask him, <HI>Why he would dye? Whe|ther
he wanted Meat and Drink? Whether he had
not a Hand&s;om Wife?</HI> and &s;uch like Que&s;tions.
The next thing to be taken care of, is to &s;end a
Pre&s;ent to the Prie&s;t to pray for the Soul of the de|cea&s;ed
Party, which he is to do Morning and E|vening,
for &s;ix Weeks, upon his Grave. For
tho' the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> do not believe Purgatory
<PB N="167" REF="91">
yet they believe two different Places, where the
Soul retires till the Day of Judgment; &s;ome,
they &s;ay, abide in a plea&s;ant Place, where they
enjoy the Conver&s;ation of Angels; others in a dark
Valley, where they are pe&s;ter'd with the Company
of Devils. They are of Opinion, that by the
Prayers of Prie&s;ts and Monks, the Souls may be
delivered out of this Place of Mi&s;ery, and God's
Wrath be appea&s;ed again&s;t the Day of Judgment.
For which rea&s;on al&s;o, tho&s;e that are able give fre|quent
Alms, during the&s;e &s;ix Weeks. Before it be
put into the Coffin, which is made out of the
Trunk of a Tree, the Body is well wa&s;h'd, the

of new Shooes on the Feet, with the Arms cro&s;s

&s;ome ki&s;&s;ing him, &s;ome the Coffin; and as &s;oon as
the Prie&s;t has put a Te&s;timonial between his Fin|gers,
which is to &s;erve him as a Pa&s;s for the other

Grave, with the Face towards the Ea&s;t. The Kin|dred,
after having paid their Devotions to the Ima|ges,
return to the Hou&s;e, where they drown their

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Civil Government, Laws, and Ju&s;ti|ciary
Proceedings of the Mu&s;covites.</HEAD>
<P>THE State of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> or its Political Govern|ment,
of which we are to treat in this Chap|ter,
is not only Monarchical, but al&s;o De&s;potical or
Ab&s;olute; fora&s;much as the Czar being &s;ole and
ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter over all his Subjects, di&s;po&s;es with|out
Controul of their Lives and E&s;tates, in the &s;ame
manner as in mo&s;t antient Times did the Kings of
<HI>A&s;&s;yria, Media</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who governed their
Subjects no otherwi&s;e, than a Lord does his Slaves;
and as it is to this day in <HI>Turky,</HI> where the
<HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> di&s;po&s;es of the Lives and Fortunes
of his Subjects at plea&s;ure. The Czars of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;o uncontrouled a Power, as Here|ditary
Sovereigns of the&s;e va&s;t Countreys we have
given a &s;hort De&s;cription of in the foregoing Chap|ters,
that there is not a <HI>Knez</HI> or Lord &s;o great in all
the&s;e va&s;t Dominions, but who without Reluctan|cy
confe&s;&s;es, that he is his Czari&s;h Maje&s;ty's <HI>Galop</HI>
or Slave. It is therefore the Czar alone, that gives
Laws to the People; it is he that di&s;po&s;eth of the
Government of Provinces; it is he that Levies
Taxes, makes Peace and War; and to be &s;hort, does
what he plea&s;es. For, tho' he con&s;ults in Matters of
Importance with his <HI>Boyars</HI> or Councellors; yet, be|&s;ides,
that this Coun&s;el is of his own Chu&s;ing; he
does not always follow it, but re&s;erves to him&s;elf
the Prerogative of doing what he judges mo&s;t con|venient.
The Honours of <HI>Knez, Boyars, Dukes</HI> or
<HI>Princes</HI> owe all their Origin to the Czar's Favour,
which they be&s;tow upon &s;uch as they would Re|ward
for their Services; and the greate&s;t of them
<PB N="170" REF="93">
depend upon the Czar's meer Plea&s;ure, and own pub|lickly,
that all they have belongs to God and Them:
Nay, formerly (within our Age) they were whipt
like the vile&s;t Slaves, and that &s;ometimes for a &s;mall
matter, but of late years &s;mall mi&s;carriages have
been puni&s;hed with two or three days Impri&s;onment.
This Slavi&s;h Subjection &s;eems to be natural to the
<HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> fora&s;much as in all the&s;e &s;everal Revolu|tions
that have happened there in our Age, they
have frequently changed their Ma&s;ters, but never
&s;hew'd the lea&s;t inclination of changing the Form of
their Government, which the Sovereign Power has
devolved into their hands. The wi&s;er &s;ort among
them were perhaps &s;en&s;ible, that tho&s;e who are
good Slaves, make the wor&s;t Freemen in the World;
not only their natural Inclination, but al&s;o their
Education, having infu&s;ed into them the Princi|ples
of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience,</HI> in &s;o tran&s;cendent a De|gree,
as not to have the true Sen&s;e of that Liber|ty
we enjoy in the&s;e Parts. This is &s;ufficiently evi|dent
out of their whole Behaviour, both in pu|blick
and private; None among them, of what
Quality &s;oever approaches the Czar with a Petiti|on
or otherwi&s;e, but he names him&s;elf in the Di|minutive.
As for in&s;tance, if his Name be <HI>Peter,</HI>
he will &s;ay, <HI>I little Peter,</HI> do implore, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> When
they are to be admitted into his Pre&s;ence, they
&s;ay; <HI>Shall I have the Honour to &s;ee the brightne&s;s of
the Eyes of His Czari&s;h Maje&s;ty?</HI> If you ask them
a Que&s;tion that &s;urpa&s;&s;es their Judgment, they will
an&s;wer; <HI>God and the Czar knows;</HI> and nothing is
more frequent in their common Di&s;cour&s;e, than to
own, that, <HI>all what they have is at God's and the
Czar's Di&s;po&s;al.</HI> The Great Duke, <HI>John Ba&s;ilowits,</HI>
was the fir&s;t that reduced them to this entire Sub|mi&s;&s;ion;
for, when mo&s;t of the&s;e Territories, now
under the Subjection of the Grand Czar of <HI>Mu&s;co|vy,</HI>
were divided into a great many Principalities,
Govern'd by their own Laws and Princes, there is
no que&s;tion, but that the Nobility had their Share
in the Government here, as well as they had in
<PB N="171" REF="93">
former Ages in mo&s;t Countreys of <HI>Europe;</HI> and
what confirms me the more in this Opinion, is,
that at the Solemnity of the Czar's Coronation,
among other Things the <HI>E&s;tates, Eccle&s;ia&s;tical and
Temporal,</HI> are mentioned by the Patriarch, as we
&s;hall &s;ee anon. This entire Re&s;ignation and Sub|jection
of the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> to the Ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;al
of their Sovereign, has ever &s;ince been maintain'd
by three general Maxims; The fir&s;t is, that no bo|dy
is allow'd, upon pain of Death, to travel out
of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> without leave of his Czari&s;h Maje&s;ty;
The &s;econd is, that the Czar never Marries a foreign
Prince&s;s, but looks out for a Spou&s;e among his
own Subjects. The third is, the Di&s;couragement
of Learning and Sciences, their Knowledge, even
of the Prie&s;ts them&s;elves, not reaching beyond
Reading and Writing their own Language. The
rea&s;on of it is obvious; for a&s;much as Igno|rance
makes people &s;upple, and conduces much to
the ea&s;ie Con&s;ervation of what by a long Cu&s;tom
and Education has been implanted in them; where|as
Knowledge is merely without Ambition. <HI>Ly|curgus</HI>
was not ignorant of this Maxim, when he
e&s;tabli&s;h'd Ignorance as one of the fundamental
Laws of his Republick; And the Emperours, <HI>Va|lentinian</HI>
and <HI>Licinius,</HI> u&s;ed to term Learning the
Plague and Poy&s;on of Sovereignty. And, that
by Travelling abroad they might not be enamour'd
with the &s;weet ta&s;te of Liberty, other Nations en|joy&punc;
and perhaps, by their Conver&s;ation, be in|&s;tructed
in &s;uch Matters, as were not to be learn'd
at home; they were not only prohibited to go a|broad
into other Countreys, but al&s;o Per&s;ons of a
high Rank debarr'd from Conver&s;ing with foreign
Mini&s;ters in their own Country, without the Great
Duke's expre&s;s Permi&s;&s;ion. And for fear, that by
introducing a foreign Prince&s;s, &s;ome new Cu&s;toms
might be introduced among the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> which
in time might cau&s;e an Alteration in the State, the
Czars of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> (quite contrary to what is pra|cti&s;ed
by other Princes in <HI>Europe)</HI> always chu&s;e their
<PB N="172" REF="94">
Spou&s;es among their own Subjects. The Czar be|ing
thus &s;ecure of his Subject's entire Obedience,
he alone creates and depo&s;es Magi&s;trates, and or|ders
them to be puni&s;hed at Plea&s;ure. He ap|points
the Governours and Lieutenants of Provinces,
for the Management of the antient Deme&s;nes, and
the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice; they have a <HI>Diack</HI>
or Secretary, and &s;ometimes another A&s;&s;e&s;&s;or join'd
with them, and take Cogni&s;ance of all Matters,
giving a final and ab&s;olute Judgment in all Cau&s;es,
and have full Power to &s;ee their Sentences put in
Execution, without any Appeal; unle&s;s the Cau&s;e
be removed before Judgment given, to one of the
<HI>Pricas</HI> or Courts of Ju&s;tice in <HI>Mu&s;co.</HI> They are
changed from three years to three years.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Courts, kept by the <HI>Waywode</HI> or
Governour in the Provinces, there are a great
many others, who are all kept in the City of <HI>Mu&s;|co,</HI>
and are call'd <HI>Pricas,</HI> where always one of the
<HI>Boyars,</HI> or the Czar's Mini&s;ters is Pre&s;ident, having
join'd with him, &s;ometimes one, &s;ometimes more
A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and a <HI>Diack</HI> or Secretary.</P>
<P>The chiefe&s;t are <HI>Pomie&s;tnoi Pricas,</HI> where a Re|gi&s;ter
is kept of all Manors held by homage, and
the Sutes concerning them are adjudged, and the
Duties belonging to the Great Duke received.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Ca&s;anskoi,</HI> and <HI>Siberskoy Pricas;</HI> all differ|ences
of the Provinces of <HI>Ca&s;an</HI> and <HI>Siberia,</HI> are
determined, and Accompts kept of all the Furs
coming from thence to the Great Duke.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Rosboinoy Pricas,</HI> all Robberies upon the
High-way, Murthers, and other Criminal Cau&s;es
are Judged.</P>
<P>The Provinces of <HI>Gallitz</HI> and <HI>Wolodimer,</HI> have
al&s;o their particular <HI>Pricas,</HI> which is called <HI>Gallia&s;|ko-Volodimirski
Pricas;</HI> as <HI>Novorodkoi Pricas</HI> belongs
to <HI>Novogorod,</HI> and <HI>Ni&s;e-novogorod.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Knez</HI> and <HI>Boyars</HI> have their own <HI>Pricas,</HI>
as have al&s;o the Gentlemen and Officers of the
Court. The <HI>Diacks,</HI> Secretaries, Clerks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have
their own Judge.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="94">
In the <HI>Mona&s;terski Pricas,</HI> all Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Per|&s;ons,
whether Secular Prie&s;ts or Monks are judged,
except it be in priviledged Ca&s;es. Be&s;ides which,
the Patriarch has his particular <HI>Pricas.</HI></P>
<P>There are a great many other <HI>Pricas,</HI> or Courts of
Ju&s;tice, as tho&s;e for the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Factors, for his Re|venues,
for the <HI>Galops</HI> or Slaves, for the Retalers of
Wine, <HI>Aqua Vitae,</HI> and Hydromel or Mead, for his
Smiths, Armourers, Cannoneers; For the Milita|ry
Officers, for the Cavalry, and many more, too
many to be de&s;cribed here.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides which, there is one general <HI>Pricas</HI> or
Court of Ju&s;tice, where all Matters that do not
appertain to any peculiar <HI>Pricas,</HI> are determined,
this is called <HI>Siskoi Pricas.</HI></P>
<P>All the <HI>Diacks</HI> or Secretaries, Clerks, and Copiers
of the&s;e Courts, are very well Skill'd in Writing
and Arithmetick, the latter of which they perform
by the help of Plumb-Stones in&s;tead of Compters.
They keep their Regi&s;ters in Rolls of Paper pa&s;ted
together, which being 30 or 40 Yards long, are
kept in the Offices. The <HI>Boyar,</HI> who is Pre&s;ident
of each Court, and has his Secretary and A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors,
determines finally, all &s;uch Cau&s;es as come under
his Cogni&s;ance, he being the Repre&s;entative of his
Imperial Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Formerly mo&s;t of the&s;e Cau&s;es depended from
the Equity of the Judge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws of <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI></NOTE> there being very few
Laws e&s;tabli&s;hed then, according to which, Judg|ment
was to be given; They only were concerning
High Trea&s;on, Adulteries, Thefts, and Debts be|tween
private Per&s;ons. But in the Year 1647, a
Book was compiled in <HI>Folio,</HI> under the Title of <HI>So|borna
&V;lo&s;ienia,</HI> that is to &s;ay, Univer&s;al and Gene|ral
Right, containing all the &s;everal Laws and Or|dinances,
according to which, the Judges were to
regulate them&s;elves in the Courts of Judicature.
In Civil Ca&s;es, they proceed thus: If there be no
&s;ufficient Evidence on the Plaintiff's &s;ide as to the
Matter of Fact alledged again&s;t the Defendant, the
latter is ask'd, Whether he will by his Oath, con|firm
<PB N="174" REF="95">
the An&s;wer given to the Plaintiff's Declara|tion,
or el&s;e refer it to the Plaintiff's Oath. He,
who con&s;ents to take the Oath, is brought in the
pre&s;ence of one of their Saints, where being ad|moni&s;hed,
and ask'd, Whether he will take this
Oath upon the Salvation of his Soul? If he per|&s;i&s;ts
in his Re&s;olution, he is obliged to ki&s;s a little
Cro&s;s, and the Saint's Image. Tho&s;e that have
taken an Oath, tho' never &s;o true, are look'd upon
as Scandalous, and are not admitted to the Com|munion
in three Years after. For which Rea&s;on,
and to obviate Perjuries (which are pretty com|mon
here) the Great Duke made an Edict in the
Year 1634, That all Promi&s;es or Obligations, whe|ther
for Money or Pawning, tho' between Father
and Son, &s;hould be put in Writing, &s;ign'd by both
Parties, under Forfeiture of the Debt. Perjury
is puni&s;hed by a &s;evere Whipping and Bani&s;hment.
Strangers take their Oaths according to the Cu|&s;tom
of their &s;everal Countreys and Religions.</P>
<P>In Criminal Ca&s;es, the Accu&s;ed cannot be Con|demn'd,
altho'never &s;o many Witne&s;&s;es appear again&s;t
him, unle&s;s he confe&s;s the Fact. To force therefore
Criminals to a Confe&s;&s;ion of the truth, they make u&s;e
of the Torture, which has its &s;everal Degrees:
The fir&s;t is the <HI>Strapado;</HI> when they hang the
Malefactor with his Hands tyed behind, in the
Air, having fa&s;tned to his Feet a great Beam, upon
which the Executioner ever and anon gets up, to
further the Di&s;location of the Members, and con&s;e|quently
to augment the Pain. Under his Feet is
made a Fire, which with the Smoak and Heat &s;tifles
and burns him: If they don't think this &s;ufficient,
they &s;have his Head, and, as he is thus hanging,
drop gradually cold Water upon the Crown of his
Head, which is the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Torment that
can be invented. Whipping in <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> is per|form'd
thus; A lu&s;ty Fellow, one of the Executi|oner's
Men after having &s;tript them to the middle,
takes up one by one upon his Back (much after
the &s;ame manner as the Boys in <HI>England</HI> are hors'd
<PB N="175" REF="95">
by their Fellow-Scholars at School) and having ty'd
their Feet together with a Cord which comes thro'
the Legs of him that holds them up, is held by
another Servant of the Executioners, &s;o fa&s;t that
they are not able to &s;tir. The Executioner with
a Bulls Pizzle, having fa&s;tned to the end of it three
Straps of an Elks Skin not tann'd, lays it on their
Back with &s;o much Dexterity and Strength, that at
every La&s;h the Blood gu&s;hes out on all &s;ides:
Heretofore the&s;e Puni&s;hments were not accounted
Infamous, and were inflicted upon Per&s;ons of the
fir&s;t Rank; but time has in a great mea&s;ure cor|rected
that Error. Be&s;ides this, they have another
Way of Cha&s;ti&s;ement, which is al&s;o u&s;ed in Fami|lies
for the Correction of Children and Slaves. He
that is to be thus corrected, after having pull'd off
his Cloaths to the Shirt and Drawers, is laid down
upon the Ground flat upon his Belly, one &s;its a|cro&s;s
his Head and Neck, another upon his Feet,
each of them furni&s;h'd with a good Switch, where|with
they &s;oundly tickle his Back, in the &s;ame
Manner as we beat the Du&s;t out of Cloaths or
Hangings. Murther is a capital Crime, unle&s;s no
body pro&s;ecute it; or it be that a Man kills his
Wife or Slave under Correction. He that has com|mitted
a Murther, after he has been kept with
Bread and Water in clo&s;e Pri&s;on, has his Head cut
off; But if a Wife kills her Husband, &s;he is put
in the Ground, alive, up to the Neck, till &s;he dies.
The Puni&s;hment of Coiners is, to have &s;ome
Metal ready melted pour'd down their Throats.
Traitors, after they have been tormented to the
highe&s;t Degree, are often bani&s;h'd into <HI>Siberia,</HI>
&s;ome with their No&s;es and Ears cropp'd, &s;ome
without Eyes, &s;ome are put under the Ice. Hang|ing
has not been long in u&s;e in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia;</HI> but
what is mo&s;t remarkable is, that the Malefactor,
mo&s;t commonly at the Command of the Hangm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n,
puts his Neck thorow the Noo&s;e, and turns him|&s;elf
off, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">uch particular Admirers are the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI>
of Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience. Thefts are not capital in
<PB N="176" REF="96">
<HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> but they are not &s;paring in applying to
them the Torture for the Di&s;covery of their Ac|complices.
The fir&s;t time, after a &s;ound Whipping
acro&s;s the Market-place, they have one Ear cut off,
and are impri&s;on'd for two Years; The &s;econd
time they receive the &s;ame Puni&s;hment; but as an
additional Cha&s;ti&s;ement, are bani&s;h'd into <HI>Siberia.</HI>
The Concealers and Receivers undergo the &s;ame
Puni&s;hment. Tho&s;e that &s;ell Tobacco and <HI>Aqua
vitae</HI> without Licence, have their No&s;trils &s;lit, or
el&s;e are whipt. How they puni&s;h Adultery is
mentioned before. Tho&s;e that are uncapable of
paying their Debts, are us'd with a mo&s;t barbarous
Severity: For if any one happen to fail of paying
at the time prefi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, he is put in a Sergeant's
Hou&s;e for &s;ome time, to &s;ee whether in the mean
time he can make Satisfaction or agree with the
Creditor. If he cannot, he is carried to Pri&s;on,
and from thence brought every Day to a certain
Place appointed for that purpo&s;e, where, for a
whole Hour, the Executioner beats him with a
pretty thick Wand acro&s;s the Shin-bone. If he
can put in Security for his forth-coming the next
day, in order to receive the &s;ame Cha&s;ti&s;ement, he
is permited to go home; if not, he is remanded
to Pri&s;on, and is to undergo the &s;ame every day
till he has made Satisfaction; which if he cannot
do at la&s;t, he is to be &s;old as a Slave to his Credi|tor,
with Wife and Children; but this la&s;t the <HI>Mu&s;|covites</HI>
are not much concern'd at, fora&s;much as
they frequently fell them&s;elves and their whole
Family upon a very &s;lender Account. So much are
they accu&s;tom'd to Slavery, that they &s;carce look
upon it as a Puni&s;hment. Sometimes the Execu|tioner,
for a Pre&s;ent, will &s;uffer the Debtor to put
a &s;mall Iron Plate under his Boots. The &s;ame
Rigour is u&s;ed, without any difference, to all of
what Quality, Condition, Sex or Age &s;oever.</P>

their Ve&s;ts of Velvet, lin'd with Sables,
their Caps adorn'd with Pearls and precious Stones,
and their Parti&s;ans cover'd with Gold and Silver.
At the upper End of the Hall of Audience, His
Czari&s;h Maje&s;ty is placed in a Throne of Ma&s;&s;ie
Silver, with his Scepter in his Hand, and a Crown
on his Head. The Throne is mo&s;t curiou&s;ly wrought,
&s;tanding &s;even or eight Steps higher than the
Floor. The Crown which the Czar upon &s;uch an

all over with precious Stones, it terminates
towards the Top, in the Form of a Pyramid, with
a Golden Cro&s;s at the Spire. The Scepter gli&s;ters

the Chair or Throne, but &s;omething Lower &s;tand
four young Lords, remarkable for their Tallne&s;s,

of Chri&s;tian Amba&s;&s;adors, that they and their Re|tinue
are obliged to ki&s;s the Grand Czar's Hand;
which, as it is otherwi&s;e look'd upon as a thing
much below the Dignity of an Amba&s;&s;ador; &s;o it
is con&s;ider'd in the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Court as a particular
Favour, which is only granted to the Amba&s;&s;adors
of Chri&s;tian Princes, and never permitted to In|fidels.</P>
<P>The Revenues of the Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> are pro|portionable

the Reign of <HI>Michael Federowitz,</HI> when the famous
Siege of <HI>Smolensko</HI> was to be undertaken, in the
Year 1632. But mo&s;t frequently at the Begin|ning

<P>The Great Duke's proper Deme&s;ne, is always farm'd

<P><HI>THE Mu&s;covites</HI> do all profe&s;s one and the

The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> glory, that they are the only
True <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> now in the World; fora&s;much
as they are baptized, whereas others have
been only Sprinkled, which is the Rea&s;on they
<PB N="189" REF="103">
alledge for Re-baptizing all &s;uch, of what
Per&s;ua&s;ion &s;oever, that embrace their Religion.
They profe&s;s, as they &s;ay, the true <HI>Greek</HI> Religion,
which makes them &s;hew abundance of Re&s;pect and
Kindne&s;s to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> &s;o that the <HI>Greek</HI> Monks
or Prie&s;ts, which frequently come from other
parts into <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> with their Relicks, know how
to make an Advantage of their Simplicity and Ig|norance.
They found their Religion on the Books
of the Old and New Te&s;tament. They are forbid|den
to bring the whole Bible to Church (tho they
are allowed to read it at home) by rea&s;on of &s;everal
pa&s;&s;ages in the Old Te&s;tament; &s;o that they only
carry the New Te&s;tament, and &s;ome certain cho&s;en
P&s;alms and Ver&s;es taken out of the Prophets. It
is about three&s;core years ago that they got the Bible
tran&s;lated into the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Language, wherein they
followed, as they pretend, the foot-&s;teps of the
<HI>Seventy Interperters.</HI> They have al&s;o a certain Book,
which they call the <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Go&s;pel,</HI> but the
whole &s;o adulterated with Fabulous Narrations, and
Impertinent Circum&s;tances, that in another Chri|&s;tian
Country it would be &s;o far from being look'd
upon as a Book of Devotion, that it would appear
abominable. As to the Explication of the Bible,
they follow St. <HI>Cyril</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> who
flouri&s;h'd towards the latter end of the Fourth Age,
under the Reign of the Emperor <HI>Theodo&s;ius,</HI> and
ought not to be confounded with <HI>Cyril</HI> of <HI>Alexan|dria.</HI>
The re&s;t of the Fathers, which are in greate&s;t
e&s;teem among the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> are <HI>John Dama&s;cene,
Gregory Nazianzen,</HI> St. <HI>John Chy&s;o&s;tome,</HI> and <HI>E|phraim</HI>
the <HI>Syrian;</HI> of whom they relate, that an
Angel having pre&s;ented to him a Book writ in Gol|den
Characters, which no body could di&s;clo&s;e, he
immediately received tho&s;e In&s;tructions from
thence, which he has tran&s;mitted in his Books to
Po&s;terity. They relate out of their Annals, that
the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion was fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed in the&s;e
parts by the Apo&s;tle St <HI>Andrew,</HI> who leaving
<HI>Greece,</HI> came to the <HI>Bory&s;thenes,</HI> where he embark'd,
<PB N="190" REF="104">
and by the Sea of <HI>Ladoga,</HI> came to <HI>Novogorod,</HI>
where he Preach'd the Go&s;pel. That the Chri&s;tian
Religion was afterwards extirpated by the Neigh|bouring
Pagans, who made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of
<HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> till in the Year 989. Prince <HI>Wolodimer,</HI>
or <HI>&V;lodimer,</HI> Great Duke of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> having given
them a &s;ignal Overthrow, and re-united &s;everal of
the&s;e Provinces to his Crown, grew &s;o famous for
his great Atchievements, that <HI>Ba&s;ilius</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantine
Porphyrogennetae,</HI> Emperours of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> &s;ent
their Amba&s;&s;adours to Congratulate his good Suc|ce&s;s;
and that by the Conver&s;ation and In&s;tructions
of the&s;e Amba&s;&s;adors, Prince <HI>Wolodimer</HI> was in|duc'd
to embrace the Chri&s;tian Faith, and to receive
Bapti&s;m. <HI>John Cropalates</HI> who writ part of the
<HI>Byzantine Hi&s;tory,</HI> and lived much about the &s;ame
time, as al&s;o <HI>Cedren</HI> and <HI>Zonaras</HI> chiefly attribute
the Conver&s;ion of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> to the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion,
to a Miracle perform'd by a Bi&s;hop that was
&s;ent thither by the <HI>Patriarch</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> to in|&s;truct
and baptize the people. For, the&s;e Infidels
having objected to him, That, &s;ince God had pre|&s;erved
<HI>Daniel</HI>'s Companions in the Fiery Furnace,
why might not with the &s;ame, or more rea&s;on, the
Bible be prevented by God's power, from being
con&s;umed by Fire? The Bi&s;hop, after having told
them that he was a&s;&s;ured he could not ask any thing
from God, which he could not obtain by his prayers,
ca&s;t the Bible into a great Fire, made for that pur|po&s;e,
where having lain till the Fire was all &s;pent,
it was taken out as entire and untouch'd as it was
ca&s;t in, whereat <HI>Wolodimer</HI> being moved, aboli&s;h'd
all Idolatry, and in lieu thereof, planted Chri&s;tia|nity
in all his Territories. From hence it is, that
they deduce the Origin of their Religion from the
<HI>Greek</HI> Church, which however, they have much
alter'd &s;ince.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="104">
The Creed of <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI> is the general Rule of
their Faith, for they believe in <HI>God the Father</HI> as
Creator of the World, in <HI>God the Son,</HI> as Saviour
and Redeemer of Mankind, and in <HI>the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI>
as Sanctifier of all the Faithful; but for the re&s;t,
they are involved in a great many Super&s;titions,
and fix the Center of their Devotion, more in the
outward and Ceremonial Part, than in the Internal
Part of Religion. They pay their Venerations
to the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI>
and an infinite number of other Saints, not only
as Interce&s;&s;ors, but Co-operators of their Salvation,
for they pay to their Saints and Images all
the Honours due to none but God Almighty.
There is never a Family &s;o &s;mall in <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;covy,</HI> but
what has its Tutelar Saint's Image hung up again&s;t
the Wall of the Chamber, unto whom the igno|rant
People pay their daily Devotion, and all the
religious In&s;tructions they give to their Children,
tends to no more, than to &s;tand with a great deal of
Re&s;pect, and to &s;ay their Prayers before tho&s;e I|mages;
for the re&s;t, they place the utmo&s;t Excel|lency
of their good Works (which they believe me|ritorious)
in building of Mona&s;teries and Churches,
and giving Alms. Tho&s;e who intend to change
their Religion, and embrace the <HI>Mu&s;covian,</HI> are
obliged to go for &s;ix Weeks into &s;ome Mona&s;tery or
another, where all the In&s;tructions they receive, is,
how to &s;ay their Prayers, how to reverence
their Saints and Images, and how to make the
Cro&s;s.</P>
<P>The whole Exerci&s;e of the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Religion,
may be reduced under the&s;e &s;everal Heads, <HI>viz.</HI>
Bapti&s;m, Reading of the Word of God in their
Churches, going to Ma&s;s, Praying to Saints, and
making Reverences before their Images, Proce&s;&s;ions,
Pilgrimages, Fa&s;tings, Confe&s;&s;ion and Commu|nion.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="105">
Bapti&s;m,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Bap|ti&s;m.</NOTE> they look upon as the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary
Point of Religion; they acknowledge them&s;elves
conceived and born in Sin, and that by Bapti&s;m,
they are regenerated and clean&s;ed, according to
God's In&s;titution, from their original Impurity.
They baptize their Children as &s;oon as they are
born; and, unle&s;s they be too weak (when
they Baptize them at home, but never in the
&s;ame Room where the Mother lies) they are
carried to Church by the Godfather and Godmo|ther,
where being met at the Door by the Prie&s;t,
he &s;igns the Child with the Sign of the Cro&s;s in
the Forehead, and gives him the Benediction,
&s;aying. <HI>The Lord pre&s;erve thy coming in, and
thy going out.</HI> Then they walk up together to
the Font, which &s;tands in the middle of
the Church, cro&s;s which, the Prie&s;t fa&s;tens nine
lighted Wax-Candles, delivered to him by the
Godfathers, whom he Incen&s;es, and Con&s;ecrates
the Water with a great many Ceremonies. Then
the Proce&s;&s;ion begins about the Font; the Clerk
goes before with the Image of St. <HI>John,</HI> being
followed by the Godfathers, with Wax-Can|dles
in their Hands; thus they go about it
three times, whil&s;t the Prie&s;t Reads out of a
Book. The Proce&s;&s;ion being over, the Godfa|thers
give the Name of the Child to the
Prie&s;t, in Writing, upon his Demand, who
puts it upon an Image, which he holds upon
the Child's Brea&s;t, and after &s;ome &s;hort Pray|ers,
asks the God-fathers, Whether <HI>the Child
believes in God the Father, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t.</HI>
Having an&s;wer'd, Yes, they all turn their
Backs to the Font, as a Sign of their Aver|&s;ion
to the three next following Que&s;tions,
to be asked by the Prie&s;t, to' wit; Whether
<HI>the Child for&s;akes the Devil?</HI> Whether <HI>he for|&s;akes
his Angels?</HI> Whether <HI>he for&s;akes his
Works?</HI> The Godfathers an&s;wering, Yes,
di&s;tnctly to every Que&s;tion, and Spit|ting
three times upon the Ground.
<PB N="293" REF="105">
Then they face about again to the Font&punc; and being asked
by the Prie&s;t, whether they promi&s;e to bring up the
Child in the true <HI>Greek</HI> Religion, they advance with
the Child nearer towards the Door (for fear the De|vil,
by whom they believe Children to be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
before Bapti&s;m, &s;hould take up his Re&s;idence in the
Church) where he begins the Exorci&s;m, putting
his Hands upon, and blowing three times cro&s;s the
Child with the&s;e Words: <HI>Get out of this Child thou
unclean Spirit, and make way for the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI> Then
returning to the Font, he cuts off a little of the
Childs Hair, which he puts into a Book, and, ha|ving
asked the God-fathers, whether the Child was
brought thither to be Baptized, he takes him &s;tark
Naked into his Arms, and dips him three times into
the Water, pronouncing the Words of the Sacra|ment
in the mean while, <HI>viz. I Baptize thee in the
Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Gho&s;t.</HI> Immediately after the Bapti&s;m, he &s;igns it
with the &s;ign of the Cro&s;s on the Forehead, upon
the Hands, Brea&s;t and Back, with a certain Oyl
con&s;ecrated for that purpo&s;e, and having put a corn
of Salt in the Child's Mouth, and a clean Shirt a|bout
him, <HI>Thou art,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>as clean and as clear from

&s;ome P&s;alms, and St. <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI>'s Creed: Sometimes
they add an Homily out of St. <HI>Chry&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tom,</HI> or certain
Prayers, or rather Anthems; &s;ung much after the
&s;ame manner as the <HI>Antiphona's.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The general Morning-Anthems are,</HI> Deliver me, O
Lord, of thy abundant Mercy: For thy Mercy's &s;ake,
clean&s;e me from my Sins; O Lord, my Saviour. <HI>This
is for the Mattens, or Morning-Prayers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>At Noon-Prayers, this Anthem is u&s;ed, among&s;t

is in him: Halleluja; Halleluja.</P>
<P><HI>That for the Ve&s;pers, is;</HI> Lord, hear my Prayer,
and hear me when I call; and let my Cry come unto
thee.</P>
<P>At the Conclu&s;ion of the&s;e, or any other of their
Anthems, the People repeat three times (making
every time the Sign of the Cro&s;s) their <HI>Go&s;podi Pomi|lui;</HI>
or, <HI>Lord, have Mercy upon me.</HI></P>
<P>This done, the Prie&s;t, attended by the Clerk,
goes up to the Altar, where he &s;ays the Office, ac|cording
to the Liturgy of St. <HI>Ba&s;il.</HI> He pours Red
Wine and Water (in Imitation of the Blood and
Water that came out of our Saviour's Side) into the
Chalice, with &s;ome little Bits of Leaven'd Bread;
and after having con&s;ecrated them, and &s;aid &s;everal
Prayers, he takes out the Bread with a Spoon, but
gives nothing of it to any body, unle&s;s it be to &s;ome
&s;ick Child, brought thither on purpo&s;e to receive the
Communion according to the In&s;titution of the <HI>Mu&s;|covite</HI>

even the Great Duke him&s;elf. The People &s;tand all
the Service-time, and ince&s;&s;antly bow and pay their
Reverences to the Images, frequently pronouncing
<HI>Go&s;podi Pomilui</HI> or <HI>Lord have Mercy upon me.</HI> The
mo&s;t Devout pro&s;trate them&s;elves, knocking their

when they fall pro&s;trate upon Sycamore-Bran|ches

on their Caps, which are given them at their
Con&s;ecration. But if a Prie&s;t have known his Wife,
if he have touched a dead Corps, or been at a Bu|rial,
he is not to offici<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">te at the Altar the &s;ame Day,
but is obliged to &s;ub&s;titute another in his Place.
The mo&s;t Devout keep at a di&s;tance, not entring the
Church, but perform their Devotion at the Door,
among the Women: The fair Sex (as if they were
not &s;ufficiently di&s;ciplined at home) having this, as
an additional Mortification, enjoined them, that
they mu&s;t keep at a di&s;tance at Church; e&s;pecially
if they have chanced to take the Husband in a good
Humour, and enjoyed lately the Plea&s;ures of Matri|mony.

Factors and Merchants; then the Secretaries, <HI>Knez</HI>
and <HI>Boyares,</HI> who go immediately before the Great
Duke, mo&s;t of them with Palm twigs in their Hands.
The Grand Duke him&s;elf marches on foot, richly

on both &s;ides by two of the principal <HI>Bojares,</HI>
or Coun&s;ellors of State; and leading by the Bridle,
which is three or four Yards long the Patriarch's

a White Fine Linnen Cloth, is di&s;gui&s;ed like an A&s;s,

People, who receive his Benediction with very low

making the Sign of the Cro&s;s. He is &s;urrounded by
Metropolitans, and other Prie&s;ts; whereof, &s;ome

having laid it upon a Silver Plate, he pre&s;ents his
Diamond-Cro&s;s to him to ki&s;s: This being done with
a mo&s;t profound Reverence by the <HI>Czar,</HI> the Patri|arch
waves it on high, all round about, fir&s;t towards

&s;ome Hymns, which having lengthen'd the whole
Devotion to an Hour, the Proce&s;&s;ion marches from
thence, back to the Ca&s;tle&punc; in the &s;ame manner as

Eggs to the principal Coun&s;ellors and Lords of
his Court, but al&s;o to his Military Officers re&s;iding
in the City of <HI>Mu&s;co;</HI> who all come to ki&s;s his

Occa&s;ions; and the Great Duke goes frequent|ly
on Pilgrimage, with his whole Court. The Fir&s;t
of <HI>October</HI> is, among other Days, celebrated with a
great deal of Ceremony. The Great Duke, attend|ed
by his <HI>Bojares,</HI> and Officers of his Hou&s;hold; and
the Patriarch, accompanied by &s;ome Metropolitans,
and a great Number of other Prie&s;ts, with Books
and Cro&s;&s;es in their Hands, go in Proce&s;&s;ion to the
&s;ame Church we have mentioned before, called by
them, that of the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed Trinity;</HI> and by the <HI>Ger|mans,</HI>
and mo&s;t other Strangers, <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> But be|fore
they come quite to the Church, there is a Thea|tre
erected on the Right Hand as you go to it, railed
in all about; before which are planted two great
Pieces of Cannon, whereof the Bore is near half an
Ell Diameter. The Grand Duke and Patriarch,
without admitting any body el&s;e, being got within
the Rails, upon the Theatre, the Patriarch pre&s;ents
to the Great Duke a certain Image, painted upon a
piece of Pa&s;t-board which folds together in the Mid|dle,
not unlike a Book, and is enriched with Silver
at the four Corners; to which the <HI>Czar</HI> makes a very
low Reverence, touching it with his Forehead, whil&s;t
the Prie&s;ts without the Rails are muttering over cer|tain
Prayers, appointed for that Solemnity. This
done, the Patriarch pre&s;ents to him a Golden Cro&s;s,
be&s;et with Diamonds, of about a Foot in length;
which, after the Great Duke has ki&s;&s;ed, the Patriarch
touches his Forehead and Temples with it; and &s;o
<PB N="302" REF="110">
to Church they go, where the Service is performed,
and the Solemnity ended for that Day.</P>
<P>With no le&s;s Solemnity they celebrate their <HI>New-Years-Day,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their New-Years-Day.</NOTE>
which is the fir&s;t of <HI>September;</HI> they ha|ving
no other Epache but that of the Creation of the
World, as we have mentioned before. This Pro|ce&s;&s;ion
is performed in the Ca&s;tle, where a con&s;idera|ble
number of the People are permitted to partake of
the Benediction given them by the Patriarch. He,
attended by three or four Hundred Prie&s;ts, carrying
Banners, Images, Cro&s;&s;es, and Books, comes out of
the Church, which is on the Right Hand of the Se|cond
Court of the Ca&s;tle, while the Great Duke with
his <HI>Knez, Bojares,</HI> and other Officers of his Court,
comes out on the Left Hand of the &s;ame Court. The
Grand Duke with his Cap in his Hand, and the Pa|triarch
with his Mitre on his Head, and a Cro&s;s be|&s;et
with Diamonds a Foot long in his Hand, advan|cing
to one another, the Patriarch pre&s;ents the Cro&s;s
to the Great Duke to ki&s;s; which he having done
with a mo&s;t profound Re&s;pect, the Patriarch gives
his Benediction fir&s;t to the Czar, and afterwards to
all the re&s;t there pre&s;ent, wi&s;hing them all Pro&s;perity
in the New Year.</P>
<P>As to what concerns their Images,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ima|ges.</NOTE> they &s;uffer not
any that are Carved or Graven, either in their Chur|ches
or Hou&s;es; becau&s;e, &s;ay they, the&s;e are forbid|den
in the Decalogue; but their Images are painted
with Oil upon Wood. The be&s;t of all is, That they
will not admit of any painted by Foreigners, though
done by the greate&s;t Ma&s;ters of <HI>Europe;</HI> but they
mu&s;t be painted by one of their own Religion: So
that for Colour, Painting, and Proportion they are
the mo&s;t wretched in the whole World, being about
a Foot in Breadth, and not quite a Foot and a half
in length. There is in the City of <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> as we have
mentioned in the Second Chapter, a certain Street
appointed for the Sale of the&s;e Images; though a
<HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> will never own to have bought his Saint:
For which rea&s;on, when any one of them has cho|&s;en
an Image in the God-market, he depo&s;its Mo|ney
<PB N="303" REF="110">
for the Exchange of it; if the Saint-maker
thinks it not &s;ufficient, he &s;hoves it back, and the
other Party is obliged to add more to it, till both
Parties are contented. They will own, that during
the fir&s;t Centuries, even till the Time of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI>
the Great, Images were not u&s;ed in the Church; or,
if they were, no Wor&s;hip was paid them. They
alledge that they follow in this Point the Authority
and Opinion of <HI>John Dama&s;cene,</HI> though it is more
likely they have taken them from the <HI>Greek</HI> Church.
The Walls of their Churches are every where full
of them, as they are the chief Ornaments of their
Hou&s;es, every Family having its Saint with a &s;mall
Wax-Candle before it, which they light when they
pay their Devotion. Over the Porch of their Chur|ches,
in the Market-places, and over the Gates of
their Cities you are &s;ure to meet with the Picture of
&s;ome Saint or another, but e&s;pecially with that of
the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> the Patron of
<HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Images the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> re&s;pect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">|ration of Saints.</NOTE> and look
upon as things &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that without
them they could not perform their Devotion. As of|ten
as they addre&s;s their Prayers to them, they &s;et
Wax Candles before that Saint to whom they intend
to make their Addre&s;&s;es; and after they have made
mo&s;t profound Inclinations with their Heads, they
frequently make the Sign of the Cro&s;s with three Fin|gers
of their Right Hand, touching fir&s;t the Forehead,
next the Brea&s;t, la&s;tly the Right Shoulder, and the
Left after that. They conceive in this way of cro&s;|&s;ing
them&s;elves a great deal of My&s;tery; for, they
&s;ay, the Three Fingers &s;ignifie the Trinity; by
their putting them to their Forehead, they would
&s;hew that Chri&s;t is a&s;cended into Heaven; by
cro&s;&s;ing the Brea&s;t, that God ought to be reverenced
and loved with all our Heart. But as to making
the Sign of the Cro&s;s from the Right Shoulder to the
Left, they intend to &s;ignifie the Day of Judgment;
fora&s;much as it is &s;aid, <HI>That God &s;hall place the Righ|teous
on his Right Hand, to be called to Eternal Salva|tion;
<PB N="304" REF="111">
and the wicked on the Left, to be thrown into the
Aby&s;s of Hell.</HI></P>
<P>If they pa&s;s by any of their Images in the Street,
they make a &s;tand for a while before them, till they
have made their Reverence four or five times one af|ter
another, which is done by cro&s;&s;ing them&s;elves,
and pronouncing with a loud Voice their <HI>Go&s;podi Po|milui,</HI>
or <HI>God have mercy upon me.</HI></P>
<P>They addre&s;s them&s;elves with the &s;ame Venerati|on
to &s;uch Cro&s;&s;es as they meet with in their way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cro&s;|&s;es.</NOTE>
where they are frequently ob&s;erved to &s;top, and re|peat
the &s;ame Ejaculations. The fir&s;t, nay, the only
thing Parents teach their Children, is, to make their
Reverences and Inclinations to the Images, to make
the Sign of the Cro&s;s, and to &s;ay the <HI>Go&s;podi Pomilui,</HI>
or <HI>God have mercy upon me.</HI> The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> don't
undertake any thing, nor Eating nor Drinking, or
whatever el&s;e it may be, without making fir&s;t the Sign
of the Cro&s;s, which may well be called the Intro|duction
to all the Civil Actions of the <HI>Mu&s;covites.</HI></P>
<P>The Tutelar Saints of private Hou&s;es have common|ly
their Stations a&s;&s;ign'd them in a Corner behind the
Table. Whenever a <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> comes into a Hou&s;e,
the fir&s;t thing he does is to go &s;traightways to the Saint
of the Hou&s;e; if he cannot find him, he asks, <HI>Je&s;t le
Boch,</HI> or <HI>Where is the God?</HI> After he has found him
out, he pays his Reverence to him, &s;aying his <HI>Go&s;po|di
Pomilui,</HI> or <HI>Lord have mercy upon me;</HI> and then
turns about and &s;alutes the Company. If they are to
take a merry turn with a Woman in the Room where
the Saint is, they are &s;ure to cover him fir&s;t&punc; perhaps&punc; for
fear he &s;hould tell tales. They will not allow Strangers
to touch them, or for any Body to &s;leep in the &s;ame
Room, with their Feet towards them; nay, &s;ome are
&s;o nice, as to purifie the Chamber with Incen&s;e, if any
Strangers of another Religion have lodged in it.</P>
<P>They will hold their Images to the Fire, believing
they have a Power to extingui&s;h it if they plea&s;e.
The <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Soldiers, who in the Year 1610. had
taken and burnt the City of <HI>Novogorod,</HI> when they
&s;aw the Inhabitants pre&s;enting their Images to &s;tay
<PB N="305" REF="111">
the Progre&s;s of the Flames, being convinced of their
Fondne&s;s to them, and not finding any thing el&s;e in
their Hou&s;es worth taking, carried away their Ima|ges,
which the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> afterwards redeemed at a
very good Rate. In time of Fire&punc; they &s;trive, before all
other things, to &s;ave their Images; but if they, or
a Church happen to be burnt, they would look up|on
it as a great Di&s;grace to &s;ay the Saint or Church is
burnt; but they &s;ay, They are a&s;cended. When the
Image is become obliterate or rotten, they either bu|ry
it with a great deal of Ceremony, or el&s;e (which
is the general way) throw it into &s;ome River, and
commit it to the Chance of the Current; at parting
they cro&s;s them&s;elves, and cry, <HI>Pro&s;ti, Farewel.</HI> Per&s;ons
of great Fortunes or Quality adorn their Saints with
Pearls or precious Stones; but the&s;e Demy-Gods
are &s;o tenacious of what they have once got into their
Clutches, that they will never part with any of it
again to the Owners, though never &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ece&s;&s;itous.
There are not wanting Examples, that, upon a pinch,
&s;ome have made bold to borrow of their Saints again&s;t
their Will, what formerly was their own, who have
paid for it with the lo&s;s of both their Hands. If any
one is excommunicated, his Saint, as well as his Per|&s;on,
is excluded from the Church.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Monks and Prie&s;ts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Mi|racles.</NOTE> as ignorant as
they are in other matters, have been cunning enough
not to de&s;poil the Saints of the Art of doing Miracles.
At <HI>Archangel</HI> there was once a Gang of them, who, by
&s;uch Impo&s;tures, had got a con&s;iderable Sum of Mo|ney
together; but falling out among them&s;elves
when they were dividing the Spoil, the Fraud was
di&s;covered, and &s;o had a good Whipping for their
pains. It mu&s;t be owned, there are but few In&s;tances
of this nature among the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> they being el&s;e
too zealous to call in que&s;tion the Omnipotency of
their Saints, whom they believe to have at lea&s;t &s;ome|thing
of Divinity in them. In the Year 1643. an
old Image had began to change Colour, and to turn
a little reddi&s;h. This was immediately cry'd up
not only for a Miracle, but rather for an ill Omen,
<PB N="306" REF="112">
or &s;ome Bloody Pre&s;age, to that Degree, that the
Great Duke and the Patriarch being frightned there|at,
as well as the People, preparations were ma|king
for an extrordinary Fa&s;t-day, and publick
Prayers to be made all over the Kingdom; but &s;ome
of the <HI>Bojares</HI> having thought it convenient to call
together all the Painters about the City, they
brought in their Verdict: That they believed there
was nothing ominous in the matter, fora&s;much as
they were a&s;&s;ured, that time having con&s;umed the
Paint, had only di&s;covered the colour of the Wood,
which was Red: Among others of their miraculous
Saints, they have two of a late Date; the Name of
the fir&s;t was, <HI>Sudatworets Philip Metropolite,</HI> he li|ved
in the Reign of that famous Tyrant, <HI>John Ba&s;i|lovits,</HI>
unto whom he u&s;ed con&s;tantly to make re|mon&s;trances
of his wicked Life and Cruelties, till
the Great Duke not able any longer to endure his
Reprehen&s;ions, cau&s;ed him to be &s;lain by one of his
Servants; &s;ince which time he has been reckoned
among their Holy Martyrs, and been famous for
the Miracles they have attributed to him, which
were formerly performed at <HI>Archangle,</HI> near which
he was Buried in the I&s;le of <HI>Solofka</HI> in the <HI>White Sea,</HI>

of <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> and placed in the great Church of the
Ca&s;tle; where for &s;ome time he did mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing
Miracles, by healing the Dumb, Deaf, Blind, Agues,
and Paraliticks: But of late Years, it &s;eems, the
Saint is grown Weary of his Profe&s;&s;ion of Phy&s;ick,
though they affirm, that his Body remains entire
to this day, which is not ea&s;ie to be di&s;proved, &s;ince
it is forbidden upon pain of Death, to lift up the
Cloath which covers the Body of the Saint.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, and the topping Saint of all <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI>
for Miracles, is one <HI>Sergius,</HI> who&s;e Re&s;idence was
in the Mona&s;tery of <HI>Troitza,</HI> about three&s;core Miles
di&s;tant from the City of <HI>Mu&s;co.</HI> This Saint as it
&s;eems, was in his younger Days, a Military Per&s;on
of a very graceful A&s;pect, but having taken a Di|&s;ta&s;te
at that Profe&s;&s;ion, and abandoned his vicious
<PB N="307" REF="112">
cour&s;e of Life, turn'd fir&s;t <HI>Hermite,</HI> and afterwards
got into the Mona&s;tery of <HI>Troitza,</HI> which from his
Name, ever &s;ince his Burial there, has been called
<HI>Zergeofski Troitza,</HI> it being formerly Dedicated to the
<HI>Trinity,</HI> where being &s;oon after cho&s;en Abbot, he,
and one of his Di&s;ciples, called <HI>Nikon,</HI> grew &s;o fa|mous
for the many Miracles they performed, that
they were both Canonized after their Death, which
hapned in the Year 1563. Their Heads, as they
&s;ay, do not only remain entire to this day, but al&s;o
that of <HI>Sergius</HI> (if one may believe them) has not
lo&s;t its Military Operation; for, when this Mona|&s;tery
was Be&s;ieged by the <HI>Poles,</HI> the Head of <HI>Sergius</HI>
only forced them to rai&s;e the Siege, having cau&s;ed
them to turn their Arms again&s;t them&s;elves, during
the A&s;&s;ault: 'Tis true, this Mona&s;tery was Be&s;ieged
by the <HI>Poles,</HI> under their General <HI>John Sapicha,</HI> who
was forced to abandon the Enterpize, and thus far
the <HI>Monks</HI> are in the right of it, but they were mi|&s;taken
in the true circum&s;tances of the matter; for,
a&s;much as it was not the Head of their Saint, or
their own Bravery, put the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Army that oblig|ed
the <HI>Poles,</HI> to rai&s;e the Siege: But they are not u|&s;ed
to examine Miracles with &s;o much nicety here;
for notwith&s;tanding this, the Great Dukes goe thi|ther
generally twice a Year to do their Devotion,
and when they come at two Miles di&s;tance from
the Mona&s;tery, alight from their Hor&s;es, walking
the re&s;t of the way on foot. Having performed their
Devotion, they &s;pend &s;ome days in Hunting, du|ring
which time, the Abbot entertains the Great
Duke, and his whole Retinue. The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> fre|quently
perform here their Vows of going on Pil|grimage,
and be&s;towing their Alms, made perhaps
in their Travels or Sickne&s;s, which with the Liberali|ty
of the Great Dukes, has encrea&s;ed the Revenues
of this Mona&s;tery to that Degree, that it is accoun|ted
one of the Riche&s;t and the mo&s;t Beautiful in all
<HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and maintains a great number of Monks.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a Church Dedicated to the Holy
Mother of <HI>Ca&s;an,</HI> whither many Pilgrimages which are
<PB N="308" REF="113">
made by the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> as al&s;o to <HI>Chutina,</HI> about
Eight Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Novogorod,</HI> to the Sepulchre
of one of their Saints, called <HI>Werlam,</HI> who being
Born at <HI>Novogorod,</HI> was Buried near the &s;aid Mona|&s;tery
of <HI>Chutina.</HI></P>
<P>On the Eve of the Penteco&s;t they perform certain a
naual Devotions in Memory of their departed
Friends, with a great deal of Formality, but in a
manner very Ridiculous.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of their Churches which are of Stone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Churches.</NOTE> are
all round and Vaulted, becau&s;e, they &s;ay, they have
thus a nearer re&s;emblance to Heaven, which is the
Throne of God. The&s;e have in the mid&s;t of four
Turrets, a Tower form'd at the Top, not unlike the
Knobs we put on our Bed&s;teads, having upon it a
Triple Cro&s;s: This is to repre&s;ent our Saviour, as
the head of the Church, and the Cro&s;s being the
Badge of Chri&s;tianity, they think fit, the Church of
Chri&s;t &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by it from others.
Within are neither Seats nor Benches, becau&s;e none
&s;it down, but all perform their Devotions, either
&s;tanding, or pro&s;trating them&s;elves. They don't
make u&s;e of Organs, or any other Mu&s;ical In&s;tru|ments
in their Churches, being per&s;waded, that things
inanimate, cannot glorifie God. They believe their
Churches profaned by the Entrance of any Stranger
that is not of the &s;ame Communion&punc; wherefore they
are not admitted, and as &s;oon as Di&s;covered, thru&s;t
out. But if a Dog chances to come into the Church,
they fir&s;t &s;weep, and afterwards purifie it with In|cen&s;e
and Holy Water; they al&s;o &s;hew a great deal
of re&s;pect for their Church-yards.</P>
<P>Their Bells are not hung in Steeples like ours,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lls.</NOTE>
but placed in a certain Engine, built for that purpo&s;e
in the Church-yard, near the Church: They are
for the mo&s;t part very &s;mall (tho' <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> has el&s;e
the greate&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Bell perhaps in the World) &s;eldom ex|ceeding
200 Weight. The Ropes are not fa&s;tned
to the Bells, but to the Clapper, and they fa&s;ten
two of the&s;e Ropes to both Arms near the Elbows,
and two more to both hands of a Man, &s;o that one
<PB N="309" REF="113">
&s;ingle Per&s;on may make a Chiming, in which the
<HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> take extraordinary delight, tho' it &s;ounds
but very indifferently to tho&s;e that are u&s;ed to bet|ter;
they Toll them at the beginning of Services,
and at the Elevation of the Chalice; for, the Bread
being put in immediately after the Con&s;ecration in|to
the Wine, they make but one Elevation; they
reckon the Chiming of Bells &s;o e&s;&s;ential a part of
Divine Service, that they believe it to be imperfect
without it.</P>
<P>If there be any Religion in the World that obliges
its Profe&s;&s;ors to a mo&s;t &s;evere Mortification,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Fea&s;ts&punc;</NOTE> it is
certainly the <HI>Mu&s;covian;</HI> for as if it were not &s;uffi|cient
to have enjoyned the keeping of two con&s;tant
Fa&s;t-days in the Week, to wit, the <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> and
<HI>Friday,</HI> and the Eves before Holy Days, when they
are obliged to ab&s;tain &s;o &s;trictly from all kind of
Fle&s;h, that they mu&s;t not make u&s;e of Eggs and
Milk, they have four Lents every Year: The long|e&s;t
of them is like ours of &s;even Weeks; the &s;econd
begins Eight Days after the <HI>Penteco&s;t,</HI> and la&s;ts till
St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Day; the third holds from the fir&s;t of <HI>Au|gu&s;t,</HI>
to the Sixteenth of the &s;ame Month; and the
fourth from the twelfth of <HI>November</HI> till <HI>Chri&s;tma&s;s
Day.</HI> During all the&s;e Lents, they eat neither But|ter,
nor Eggs, nor Milk, much le&s;s Fle&s;h, unle&s;s it
be in the fir&s;t Week of the long Lent, which being
their Carnaval, they have liberty for all manner of
exce&s;&s;es, except Fi&s;h. In this Week, their Extra|travagances
are almo&s;t pa&s;t belief, and as if this time
was alloted them as a preparative to their Fa&s;tings,
they commit &s;uch Debauches in double di&s;tilled
Brandies and melted Butter, which they pour down
their Throats, that they are all kindled in a Flame,
and if they are not immediately quenched with Milk,
they die upon the Spot. Woe, to any Stranger that
meets the&s;e Drunkards at Night, without being well
guarded, their In&s;olencies being &s;o great, that with
Fightings, Quarrels and Murthers, commonly Forty
or more Per&s;ons are Murthered in a Night, during
this Week; not to reckon tho&s;e, who being over|charged
<PB N="310" REF="114">
with Liquors, and wanting Attendance to
carry them Home, fell down upon the Snow, and
&s;o are Frozen to Death. It is a mo&s;t di&s;mal Specta|cle,
to behold perhaps Ten or a Dozen of the&s;e in
the Morning, carried upright in a Sledge, Frozen
to Death, &s;ome having their Faces Gnawed, others
their Arms eaten off by Dogs, others to have nothing
left but the bare Bones; and yet the&s;e are the daily
Objects one meets with in the Streets of <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> du|ring
this time of Debauchery. All the attonement
they make for the&s;e Enormities, is, That the next
Week after they live upon Honey, Herbs and Pul&s;e,
and Drink only Quus, or &s;mall Mead, and Water;
and to clean&s;e them&s;elves from the Impurities con|tracted
in the&s;e exce&s;&s;ive Debauches, they dont for|get
to vi&s;it the Bath-&s;toves. The re&s;t of the Lent,
they live pretty Temporately, and &s;ome of the mo&s;t
Devout will not eat Fi&s;h all that time, unle&s;s it be on
<HI>Sundays:</HI> But as they are very exact in ob&s;erving
the&s;e &s;trict Rules in <HI>Lent,</HI> &s;o it is a very difficult task
to per&s;wade them to eat Fi&s;h on <HI>Sundays</HI> or <HI>Holy Days</HI>
out of <HI>Lent,</HI> being of Opinion, that the Rules pre|&s;cribed
by St. <HI>Clement,</HI> in the Tomes of the Coun|cels
Printed at <HI>Venice,</HI> according to which, Laymen
that Fa&s;t on <HI>Saturdays</HI> and <HI>Sundays,</HI> ought to be Ex|communicated,
are mo&s;t con&s;onant to the Apo&s;toli|cal
In&s;titution. By the &s;ame Rule that forbids them
to eat Fle&s;h, they are al&s;o enjoyned not to meddle
with Women on their Fa&s;t-days, and during their
<HI>Lent;</HI> if the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> &s;hould &s;end abroad any Mi&s;&s;io|naries,
I am apt to believe they would make but ve|ry
few Pro&s;elites in the&s;e parts. There are &s;ome who
alledge, that the&s;e frequent Fea&s;ts have been E&s;ta|bli&s;h'd
in <HI>Mo&s;covy,</HI> rather upon a Political than Spi|ritual
account, to wit, for the pre&s;ervation of their
Cattle; fora&s;much as the Pea&s;ants, being all Slaves
here, dont take the &s;ame care for the propagating
and pre&s;erving their Cattle, as they do in other parts,
where they enjoy the Fruits of their own labour;
and that the long Winters in <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> renders the
keeping of the Cattle both very trouble&s;ome and
<PB N="311" REF="114">
chargeable, whereas they abound in the be&s;t Fi&s;h in
the World, which are &s;old at a very cheap rate all
over <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI></P>
<P>All tho&s;e that are arrived to the Age of Di&s;cretion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Con|fe&s;&s;ion.</NOTE>
are obliged to go to Confe&s;&s;&s;ion, before they receive
the Communion. Their Confe&s;&s;ion they make
&s;tanding before one of their Images, on which having
fa&s;tned their Eyes, they make a particular recital of
all their Sins, expre&s;&s;ing their Sorrow for every one
of them in particular, and promi&s;ing Amend|ment&punc;
The Prie&s;t very rarely gives them the Ab&s;o|lution
without &s;ome Penance, which con&s;i&s;t for the
mo&s;t part, in repeating frequently the <HI>Go&s;podi Pomi|lui,</HI>
or <HI>Lord have Mercy on me;</HI> in making a certain
number of Reverences before their Saints, in &s;tand|ing
at the Church-door, in ab&s;taining from Wo|men
and <HI>Aqua-Vita.</HI> But if it be a &s;in that requires
more than ordinary expiation, the Prie&s;t is not un|mindful
of his own Intere&s;t; for, in this ca&s;e, he en|joyns
them to make u&s;e of the Holy Water, which
is Con&s;ecrated on <HI>Twelfth-Day&punc;</HI> to clean&s;e Sinners of
their Sins, and is di&s;po&s;ed of for that purpo&s;e by the
Prie&s;ts, not without a good Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> receive the Communion
upon <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> Eve,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Com|munion.</NOTE> or at lea&s;t upon a Fa&s;ting Day;
fora&s;much as if they &s;hould Communicate on a <HI>Sun|day,</HI>
they mu&s;t not eat Fle&s;h that day. They pre|pare
them&s;elves for it, by an extraordinary Mortifi|cation
a Week before, when they eat nothing but
hard Bread, and drink nothing but <HI>Quus,</HI> wor&s;e
than our &s;mall Bear, or Water. They Communi|cate
in both kinds, unle&s;s it be Children under &s;e|ven
years old, at which Age, as &s;oon as they are ar|rived,
they are admitted to Communicate both, be|cau&s;e
at that Age (as they &s;ay) they begin to &s;in
mortally. They mix warm Water with Wine,
which (according to the Coun&s;el of <HI>Con&s;tantinople)</HI>
repre&s;ents the Water that came forth with the Blood
from the &s;ide of our Saviour; the Bread, which mu&s;t
be Leavened and Baked by a Prie&s;t's Widow, they
put in the Wine, taking out a Mor&s;al, together with
<PB N="312" REF="115">
&s;ome of the Wine in a Spoon. The Communion
Bread for &s;ick Per&s;ons is about twice as big, and
&s;omewhat thicker than a Crown Piece, and hath
in the middle the &s;ign of the Crucifix. This figure
(after it is Con&s;ecrated) the Prie&s;t takes off with
an In&s;trument, not unlike a Launcet, and puts it up
in a wooden Box, hanging above the Altar, to pre|&s;erve
it from Rats and Mice. If a &s;ick Per&s;on is to
receive the Communion, they take a little of it, up|on
which they put a few drops of Red Wine, and a
little Water in the Chalice, which they give to the
&s;ick Per&s;on with a Spoon; if the &s;ick Per&s;on be not
capable of &s;wallowing the Bread, they give him only
a little Wine. In the ordinary Admini&s;tration of
the Sacrament, they make u&s;e of the &s;ame &s;ort of
con&s;ecrated Bread, but not bigger than half a Crown,
from which they al&s;o take the Crucifix, and break it
into as many pieces, as there are Communicants,
which they ca&s;t into Red Wine, and mix it with a
little warm Water, and &s;o Admini&s;ter with a Spoon:
What remains of the Bread, after Con&s;ecration, is
called <HI>Kutja,</HI> or Holy Bread, of which the Prie&s;t
gives a Mor&s;el to each of tho&s;e, who have Com|municated
the Week before. At the Admini&s;tring
of the Sacrament, the Prie&s;t &s;ays the&s;e Words:
<HI>This is the true Body, and the true Blood of our Lord
Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which hath been given for thee, and for
many more, for the remi&s;&s;ion of thy &s;ins, which thou
&s;halt take in remembrance of him, God ble&s;s thee:</HI> There
have been &s;ome who from the&s;e Words have drawn
this inference, as if the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> believed Tran|&s;ub&s;tantiation,
again&s;t which &s;everal pregnant rea|&s;ons
may be alledged to the contrary. For, if you
Di&s;cour&s;e the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> concerning the Con&s;equen|ces
of that belief, they will not refu&s;e to own it ir|rational,
nay, ab&s;ur'd and ridiculous, neither do
they call to their aid (as the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> do)
God's Omnipotency. Be&s;ides that they dont pay
Adoration to this My&s;tery, which doubtle&s;s they
would do in a Religion &s;o Zealous and Super&s;titious
as theirs, were they of the &s;ame Opinion, as to this
<PB N="313" REF="115">
point, with&punc; the <HI>Roman Catholicks.</HI> Sick Children,
though never &s;o Young, receive the Communion,
but in one kind, till they are &s;even Years Old, when
they Communicate like the re&s;t, as we have ob&s;er|ved
before. They do not refu&s;e the Communion to
Madmen, but they only touch their Lips with the
Bread dip'd before in the Wine. A Woman in Child|bed
is not to Communicate in the &s;ame Room, where
&s;he was brought to Bed, but mu&s;t be fir&s;t wa&s;hed and
carried into another place. Tho&s;e that have com|mitted
Murther, are not to be Communicated but
at the point of Death; if tho&s;e that lie in extremity
are to be Communicated, they gave them fir&s;t &s;ome
Water, or <HI>Aqua-vitae,</HI> wherein &s;ome relicks have
been put, then they receive the Communion, and at
the &s;ame time the Extream Unction; which done,
they are to take nothing el&s;e, nor any Nouri&s;hment,
unle&s;s there be very apparent Signs of their amend|ment.
There are &s;ome among the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> who
at the la&s;t extremity, cau&s;e them&s;elves to be Shaven,
and become real Monks: This once done, they are
not permitted to take any thing for a Week after;
being per&s;waded that they are no more Men, but
become Angels: And if they happen, after the&s;e
Eight Days of Ab&s;tinence, to recover their Health,
they mu&s;t go into a Mona&s;tery, becau&s;e the Razor
has pa&s;&s;ed upon their Heads. Formerly they u&s;ed
to &s;end the Con&s;ecrated Bread to tho&s;e Places in the
Country that were de&s;titute of Prie&s;ts: They u&s;ed
al&s;o to give it to Travellers, to re&s;erve it for a Ca&s;e
of Nece&s;&s;ity: But this Cu&s;tom is now quite aboli&s;h|ed

Matters that have any Relation to their Religion,
that he reforms whatever he thinks prejudicial to this
Religion, or good Manners, without giving an Ac|count
of it to their Great Duke: Yet not &s;o, but that
his Orders mu&s;t be put in Execution by the <HI>Czar</HI>'s

where having nominated two or three Prelates, the
mo&s;t eminent for Learning, and other good Quali|lities,
they pre&s;ent them to the Great Duke, who,
after a Conference with the&s;e Prelates, proceeds
jointly with them, to an Election. If it happen that
tho&s;e propo&s;ed for the Election are equally eminent

forked at the End, when they go abroad, which they
call <HI>Po&s;ock,</HI> and &s;erves them for a Cro&s;ier.</P>
<P>There being in the City of <HI>Mu&s;co</HI> above 2000
Churches and Chapels, the fir&s;t of which have at
lea&s;t three or four, and &s;ome more, Prie&s;ts belong|ing
to them, it is no difficult Matter to gue&s;s what a
va&s;t Number of Prie&s;ts and Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks there mu&s;t
be in that City. Tho&s;e that are de&s;irous to enter in|to
Holy Orders, make their Addre&s;&s;es either to the
Patriarch, or any one of the Metropolitans; the
fir&s;t, the be&s;t; where having been examined con|cerning
their Qualifications, which con&s;i&s;t only in
Reading and Writing, and to be able to &s;ing in the
Church, they are admitted into Orders, with an At|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tation
of their being received into Prie&s;tood. At
<PB N="316" REF="117">
their Con&s;ecration they are inve&s;ted with the Prie&s;t|ly
Habit, as we have ju&s;t now de&s;cribed it: They
have al&s;o the Hair cut off from the Crown of their
Heads, on which is put a little Cap, or <HI>Calotte,</HI>
which is the main Character of their Prie&s;thood; the
which they never move, or take off, neither at
Church, or any where el&s;e, unle&s;s it be when they
have their Hair cut. The chief Re&s;pect the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites</HI>
pay to the Prie&s;t, he is beholden for to his <HI>Ca|lotte;</HI>
and good Rea&s;on why; for if, upon any Con|te&s;t,
or Quarrel, this <HI>Calotte</HI> &s;hould be pulled off his
Head, upon the Ground, the adver&s;e Party would
incurr the Penalty of the Mulct, called <HI>Bice&s;tie,</HI> which
we have mentioned before: To prevent which, the
<HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> when they are going to fight with a
Prie&s;t, fir&s;t reverendly take off his <HI>Calotte;</HI> which,
after they have &s;oundly cudgell'd or beaten him,
they put on again with a great deal of Re&s;pect:
Which done, they are not liable to any farther Pu|ni&s;hment,
than if they had kick'd or cuffed a Lay-Man.</P>
<P>The <HI>Proto-Popes</HI> and <HI>Popes,</HI> or <HI>Temple-Prie&s;ts,</HI> are
not only allowed, but obliged to marry once; but
cannot the &s;econd or third time, unle&s;s they quit
their Prie&s;thood. This Point of the Marriages of
Prie&s;ts is one of the main Points wherein they differ
as well from the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, as the <HI>Roman:</HI> For
which they alledge the Text of St. <HI>Paul, 1 Tim.</HI> 3.
that <HI>a Bi&s;hop &s;hould be the Husband of one Wife.</HI> And
for the Confirmation of it, they alledge the Fourth
Cannon of the Council which was held at <HI>Gangres,</HI> in
<HI>Paphlagonia,</HI> not long after that of <HI>Nice;</HI> where all
tho&s;e are Anathematized who refu&s;e to take the Com|munion
from the Hands of a Married Prie&s;t. The
<HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are &s;o &s;trict in the Ob&s;ervance of this Opi|nion,
that their Prie&s;ts mu&s;t be in a State of Mar|riage
before they are admitted into Orders: Which
makes tho&s;e that intend to embrace that kind of Life
marry very young, that they may the &s;ooner have an
Opportunity of getting a Living. They are, be&s;ides
this, to marry a Maid, and no Widow, nor a Wo|man
<PB N="317" REF="117">
the lea&s;t blemi&s;hed in her Reputation: And in
this Point they are to be &s;o circum&s;pect, that if the
Prie&s;t, the fir&s;t Night after Marriage, finds that the
Lock has been opened before, by any other Key than
his own, he mu&s;t either be divorced from her, or lay
down his <HI>Calotte;</HI> out of which two, you may be
&s;ure he chu&s;es the fir&s;t. But if the Par&s;on's Wife
&s;tands her Trial fairly the fir&s;t Night, &s;he has, how|ever,
this Comfort before the re&s;t of the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI>
Women, that &s;he is not likely to be kept under &s;o
&s;evere an Hou&s;e-Di&s;cipline as the re&s;t, for as much as
the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Prie&s;ts hang, in a great mea&s;ure, by
the Apron-&s;tring, they being, after they once become
Widowers, not &s;uffered to admini&s;ter the Sacrament,
or to a&s;&s;i&s;t at Noon-Service, when the Communion
is received, or to give their Benedictions to Marria|ges;
but only at the Morning and Evening-Services.
But to counter-ballance this Advantage the Par&s;on's
Wife has before others, the Prie&s;t is under a mo&s;t
&s;trict Obligation, that when-ever he has given his
Wife due Benevolence, he mu&s;t not approach the
Altar all the next Day; &s;o that, what with this, and
the great Number of Fa&s;ts, &s;he is likely to live upon
very &s;lender Diet, unle&s;s the Par&s;on be &s;o good-na|ture
as &s;ometimes to prefer the Duty to his Wife,
before that in the Church, and &s;ub&s;titute one to offi|ciate
in his Room at the Altar. The Prie&s;ts, how|ever,
have this Comfort left them after the Death of
their Wives, that if they do not approve of a &s;ingle
Life, they are free to lay down their Ca&s;&s;ock and <HI>Ca|lotte,</HI>
and turn Merchants, Trade&s;men, or any thing
el&s;e they can, and &s;o marry again. If they are too
old to undergo the Fatigues of the Sacerdotal Fun|ction,

where they end their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>

<P>They eat no Fle&s;h, nor Fre&s;h Fi&s;h; neither drink

only on Salt Fi&s;h, Honey, Milk, Chee&s;e, Herbs and
Pul&s;e: Cucumbers, both Fre&s;h, and Pickled, are
their chiefe&s;t Dainties; the&s;e they mince very &s;mall,

in their Mona&s;teries, when-ever they go a|broad,
(which they are allowed to do,) both Men&punc;
and Women are very forward in di&s;pen&s;ing with the
Severity of their Statutes; for they &s;eldom refu&s;e any
thing that is offered them; and will refre&s;h them&s;elves
with Strong Liquor to that Degree, that it is un&s;afe
for them to go home without good Company.
Here-tofore Super&s;tition had got &s;o far the A&s;cendant
over the Religious <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> that here, as well as
in &s;ome other Countries of <HI>Europe,</HI> they u&s;ed to make
over all that they had, for the Benefit of the Mona|&s;teries:
So that, if a Stop had not been put to the&s;e
Extravagancies, they would, in Time, have got into
the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the be&s;t part of this va&s;t Empire.
But tho&s;e that now embrace the Mona&s;tick Life, are
only allowed to carry a certain Part of their E&s;tates
with them, into the Mona&s;tery; being obliged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
leave the re&s;t to their Heirs. They do not live &s;o
retired in them, but that they appear in great Num|bers,

where they frequently follow the &s;ame Employments
with the Pea&s;ants; &s;ome of them al&s;o Trading in
Malt, Hops, all &s;orts of Corn, and Cattel. Pover|ty,
Old Age, Infirmities and Dome&s;tick Conte&s;ts
being the chief Inducements of tho&s;e that embrace
this Life, the fewe&s;t chu&s;ing it out of a Motive of

according to the general Education of the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites,</HI>
can &s;carce read or write: Not One in Ten&punc;

them that are acquainted with the <HI>Creed</HI> and the <HI>Ten
<PB N="319" REF="118">
Commandments,</HI> are looked upon as Men of extraor|dinary
Learning. I cannot forbear to relate, upon
this Occa&s;ion, a certain merry Pa&s;&s;age, which hap|pen'd
&s;ome Years ago, in the Mona&s;tery of <HI>Ro&s;tone,</HI>
for as much as it is not only very diverting, but al&s;o
may &s;erve as a convincing In&s;tance of the Simplicity
and Ignorance of the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Monks: The above|mentioned
Mona&s;tery &s;tands upon a Lake, where,
for &s;ome time, a Fi&s;h had been &s;een of an extraordi|nary
Magnitude, to the great A&s;toni&s;hment of the
Monks. This Fi&s;h, in a Sun-&s;hiny Day, would of|ten
be playing, and appearing half above Water;
&s;o that an Eagle, one time, &s;wooping at it, and be|ing
over-eager of his Prey, &s;truck his Talons into
the Fle&s;h of the Fi&s;h with &s;uch Violence, that he
could not pull them out again. The Fi&s;h being
willing to be rid of his Enemy, plunged him in to
the Bottom; &s;o that being tran&s;iated into a much
gro&s;&s;er Element than he was u&s;ed to live in before,
he &s;oon lo&s;t his Life, though his Talons &s;till &s;tuck
fa&s;t in the Fle&s;h. The Fi&s;h, very impatient of his
Burthen, made frequently towards the Shoar of the
Lake; where being perceived by the Friars, with
Feathers upon his Back, they were all put under
&s;uch a Con&s;ternation, that not one of them had the
Courage to approach it; &s;ome believing it to be an
Apparition; others, a Sea-Mon&s;ter; and &s;ome con|cluding
it could be no le&s;s than a Water-Devil: The
la&s;t Opinion, it &s;eems, was the mo&s;t prevailing; &s;o
that, to bani&s;h the Devil from that Shoar, they fell
to Ringing of Bells: And when they found this to
prove ineffectual, they went all in Proce&s;&s;ion, arm|ed
at all Points with &s;uch In&s;truments and Weapons
as are commonly made u&s;e of upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions;
but all in vain, the Mon&s;ter, or Devil, as it &s;eems,
not being afraid of their Weapons: So that all there|abouts,
nothing was to be heard of, but the dread|ful
<HI>Leviathan,</HI> which had &s;cared the poor Monks al|mo&s;t
out of their Sen&s;es. One Mr. <HI>Roger Eaton,</HI> an
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant, then living in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> coming by
chance that way, had immediately a full Relation given
<PB N="320" REF="119">
him of the Mon&s;ter; &s;o that being curious to &s;ee,
he went to the Shoar, where he found a great Num|ber
of People &s;tanding &s;ome di&s;tance off. He &s;oon
perceiving what it was that had put them into &s;uch
a Fright, told them, that he would &s;oon deliver
them from this Mon&s;ter, provided they could get
&s;ome Body that would row the Boat. But it was no
ea&s;ie matter to per&s;wade any one of them all to be
&s;o bold, as to approach &s;o near the Devil; till a cer|tain
Fellow, being made more couragious than the
re&s;t by good &s;tore of <HI>Aqua-vitae,</HI> at la&s;t undertook
the Task. As they were going off from the Shoar,
to encounter the Mon&s;ter, the Spectators, looking
upon the Attempt no le&s;s dangerous, than when
St. <HI>George</HI> fought&punc; the Dragon, gave them over for
lo&s;t, expecting every Moment to &s;ee them devoured
by this Water-Dragon: But they were agreeably
&s;urprized when they perceived the terrible <HI>Levia|than</HI>
&s;lain by his Conqueror. In &s;hort, Mr. <HI>Eaton</HI>
&s;hot and killed the Bea&s;t with a Screw'd Gun;
which, when taken up, proved to be nothing el&s;e
than a very large Pike, of about five Foot long, and
of the Thickne&s;s of a Man. It is ea&s;ily to be ima|gined,
that their Fear &s;oon turned into Shame; yet,
to hide their Blu&s;hes, and to make &s;ome Amends to
their Champion, they drunk together &s;o heartily,
till they became all mellow; and &s;o put a merry
Epilogue to the Play.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>White,</HI> another <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant, living in
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> did not meet with the &s;ame Entertainment
from the Fraternity; For, having been one time invi|ted
by them to Dinner, they had caught another Pike,
not quite &s;o big as the former; and as the Cook was
cutting it open, he found a new-born Infant in the
Belly of it; which put the Monks into &s;o ill an Hu|mour,
that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman was fain to re|turn
home without his Dinner. This Infant was
&s;u&s;pected to have been thrown into the Lake by one
of the Nuns of a Nunnery hard by this Mona&s;tery;
it being the Cu&s;tom in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> to build always a
Convent and Nunnery near to one another.</P>

The Gentleman to whom we are beholden for
the&s;e two Relations,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dr.</HI> Col|lins.</NOTE> and who has, for a con&s;iderable
time, been re&s;ident in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> having given an|other
In&s;tance of the Ignorance and Super&s;tition of
their Prie&s;ts, no le&s;s plea&s;ant than the former, it will
not be ami&s;s to in&s;ert it here. It &s;eems the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Re&s;ident in the City of <HI>Mu&s;cow</HI> had a very fine Mon|key,
famous among&s;t the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> there, for his ma|ny
Tricks and Pranks which he would be playing in
the Market. This Monkey, one Day, got into one
of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Churches, hard by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Re|&s;ident's
Hou&s;e, and tumbled down &s;ome of their
Saints. The Prie&s;t coming &s;oon after into the
Church, and &s;eeing his Gods thus handled, &s;tood
amazed; but having recovered him&s;elf a little, and
&s;et their Saint&s;hips in their re&s;pective Places, he
da&s;hed all the Windows and Doors with Holy-Wa|ter,
to keep the Devil out of the Church. But Pug
not under&s;tanding his Exorci&s;ms, took his Opportu|nity
one Morning, when the Prie&s;t was going to per|form
the Morning-Service, to be in the Church as
&s;oon as he; where he begun the old Game of ruf|fling
and pulling about the Saints, not &s;paring even
St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> him&s;elf; and that with &s;o much Eager|ne&s;s,
as if he had been bred a Quaker, grinning now
and then in the Prie&s;t's Face; who, after he had re|covered
him&s;elf out of his fir&s;t Fright, at la&s;t ap|proached,
with his Cro&s;s before him; and having
no other Way left, he betakes him&s;elf to his Sove|reign
Remedy; I mean, the Hor&s;e-Tail, dipped in
Holy-Water; wherewith he &s;o be&s;prinkled poor
Pug, (who hated it as bad as the Devil him&s;elf,)
that he made the be&s;t of his Way home to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Re&s;ident's Hou&s;e. No &s;ooner was the Morning-Ser|vice
over, but the <HI>Pope</HI> (or Prie&s;t) made mo&s;t bitter
Complaints again&s;t a certain Stranger, living in the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hou&s;e, for having thrown down his Saints,
and prophaned the Holy Place. Whereupon, he
obtained an Order to &s;earch the Re&s;ident's Lodgings:
And all his Retinue were brought forth, in the Pre|&s;ence
of the Prie&s;t; but none of them being the Per|&s;on
<PB N="322" REF="120">
he looked for, <HI>It was,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>a little Nincheen,</HI>
(or Stranger.) Whereupon, the young Children
being brought out, the Monkey, by chance, came
jumping out with them: <HI>Hold, hold,</HI> &s;aid the Prie&s;t,
with a great deal of Joy, <HI>this is the little Stranger:
Seize him, &s;eize him.</HI> Which being done according|ly,
poor Pug was had before his Betters; where not
being able to an&s;wer for him&s;elf, he was condemned
to the Strappado, and paid for his un&s;ea&s;onable Re|formation,
with his Life.</P>
<P>But, after all this merry Digre&s;&s;ion, it is time to
return to more &s;erious Matters: It is to be ob&s;erved,
that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> retain to this Day &s;ome Remnants
of the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> Law; For, though they do not ab|hor
Swine's Fle&s;h, yet they will not touch a Squir|rel,
Coney, or Hare. But, which is the odde&s;t of
all, They hold it <HI>Pagan,</HI> or <HI>Vnclean,</HI> to eat Veal;
but not Lamb: For what Rea&s;on, neither they, nor
any body el&s;e, know. They account it next to a
Sin, to omit <HI>Lotionem post inatum.</HI> They look upon
it as a great Sin, for a <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> to lie with a Wo|man
that is not of the &s;ame Communion: But a Ve|nial
Tre&s;pa&s;s, for a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Woman to accept of a

Becau&s;e her I&s;&s;ue will be educated in the True <HI>Ru&s;|&s;ian</HI>
Faith; whereas a <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Man may happen to

is carried to the Top of a low Hou&s;e, from
whence he jumps into the Fire made underneath;
and immediately they throw Straw upon him, and

<P>THE fir&s;t Origin of this Empire is very ab&s;cure;
for, the Great Dukes of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> derive their
Pedigree from <HI>Augu&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s Cae&s;ar,</HI> yet if it be con&s;ider|ed,

of the&s;e Ancient Princes are among an ignorant
People, it is no difficult matter to imagine, that
their Ancient Hi&s;tory mu&s;t be full of uncertainty.
Thus much is certain, that this va&s;t Empire was in
former Ages divided into a great many Principalities,
under their own Laws and Princes, which in after
Ages, and by &s;everal Degrees, have been united
under one Head, and compo&s;e that va&s;t Body,
which now adays is known under the name of the
<HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>But to return to their Chronicles, they relate that
<HI>Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar,</HI> among others of his Kindred, whom
he &s;ent to be Governour over very remote Provinces.
One <HI>Pru&s;&s;us</HI> had a&s;&s;igned him <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> had his Seat
on the <HI>Ea&s;tern Baltick</HI> Shoar by the River <HI>Weixel.</HI>
Of him were de&s;cended by the fourth Generation,
<HI>Rureck, Sinaus</HI> and <HI>Truvor,</HI> who, at the per&s;wa&s;ion
of one <HI>Go&s;tomi&s;tius,</HI> a rich Citizen of <HI>Novogorod,</HI> were

&s;o having divided the whole Country among them|&s;elves,
each in his Province laid the fir&s;t foundation
of a regular Civil Government.</P>

his mo&s;t horrid De&s;igns again&s;t &s;uch of the Nobility

merrily, &s;o that <HI>Dem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">trius</HI> began to be overcome by
the Strength of the Liquor; which the Tyrant per|ceiving,

put his De&s;ign in Execution, he drank to him a great
Bowl-full of Strong <HI>Hydromel,</HI> which he obliged <HI>De|metrius</HI>
to pledge, to his (the Great Duke's) Health;
but it being impo&s;&s;ible for him to drink above half of

where he &s;hould drink it at his own Lei&s;ure.
<HI>Demetrius</HI> being very willing to obey, went, without

mild Di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>The better to confirm them in this Opinion, he
got it &s;pread abroad, that he intended to abdicate the
Empire, and to retire into a Mona&s;tery: And &s;oon
after, having called together the Nobility, he told
them, That &s;ince he had two Sons, whom he in|tented
to make his Succe&s;&s;ors, he would recommend
them to their Care: That he did not que&s;tion but
they would not only pay them due Allegiance, but
al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;t them with their Coun&s;el, and good Ad|vice:
That, for his part, he intended to build him|&s;elf
a Mona&s;tery, near the City of <HI>Mu&s;co;</HI> where he
would be ready at hand to give his Directions in
Matters of any Moment. Having thus cajoll'd them

to be erected, &s;urrounded with a &s;trong Wall&punc;
which he endowed with con&s;iderable Revenues, for
the Maintenance of &s;uch as were to abide with him
there, and to lead, as he pretended, a Mona&s;tick
Life; but, in effect, to &s;erve as an Encouragement
to &s;uch as he intended to employ in the Execution of
his cruel De&s;igns: For, after he had &s;ettled him&s;elf,

of Preferment, to &s;end &s;uch of his Nobles as
he intended to &s;acrifice to his Ambition, into &s;ome

after &s;ome Time, he would command &s;ome of
his Soldiers, under &s;uch Officers as were before-hand
engaged to execute his Orders, to the Place, where
the Fact was to be perpetrated under pretence of
changing the Garri&s;on; where they remained till
they found a convenient Opportunity to &s;end, by

the antient Dukes of <HI>Roskovie,</HI> or <HI>Ro&s;thovie;</HI> whom
he dreaded, for his Courage, and Skill in Martial
Affairs. This Principality, as well as tho&s;e of <HI>Twere</HI>
and <HI>Bielski,</HI> were in former Ages allotted to the
Younger Brothers of the Dukes of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia;</HI> but were
by <HI>Ba&s;ili,</HI> the Father of <HI>John Ba&s;ilovits,</HI> appropriated
to his own U&s;e, leaving only to the Heirs a very mo|derate
Share for their Maintenance. The la&s;t of the
Dukes of <HI>Ko&s;thovie</HI> was <HI>Peter Ro&s;towski,</HI> whom the
Tyrant had made <HI>Waywode</HI> or Governor of <HI>Ni&s;e No|vogorod.</HI>
Having re&s;olved his Ruin, he &s;ent thither
40 Ruffians, whom he u&s;ed to employ on &s;uch like
Occa&s;ions, with Orders to bring to him the Head of
the &s;aid Governor. The&s;e having found him at his
Devotion, they dragg'd him from thence; and ha|ving
&s;tripp'd him &s;tark naked, and tied him in a
Sledge, they carried him &s;treight-ways to the River
<HI>Colga;</HI> where he that commanded the Party, having
cut off his Head, threw the Body into the River.
His Kindred and Children (Fifty in Number) were
all murther'd by the Tyrant's Order; and For|ty
of his Slaves condemned to perpetual Impri&s;on|ment.</P>
<P><HI>John Pietrovits,</HI> a Man of a very high Rank in <HI>Ru&s;|&s;ia,</HI>
was fain to undergo the &s;ame Fate, with his
whole Family: For, having been fal&s;ly accu&s;ed in
the Year 1568, as if he aimed at the Crown, the
Tyrant, without admitting them to be heard, &s;eized
upon his E&s;tate, both Real and Per&s;onal, which was
very great; and condemned him to go as a private
Soldier, in the War again&s;t the <HI>Tartars.</HI> Having not
&s;o much left him, out of all his E&s;tate, as an Hor&s;e
to ride upon; he was furni&s;hed with one by a cer|tain
<PB N="334" REF="126">
Friar, who took pity of his Condition;&s;o he
obeyed his Orders: And after having &s;erved &s;everal
Years as a &s;ingle Volunteer, who u&s;ed to have at his
Heels a great Number of Servants, he at la&s;t return|ed
to <HI>Mu&s;co.</HI> The Tyrant not thinking it &s;ufficient
to have humbled him thus, he called together, at a
certain Time; his Council of Nobles; where having
&s;ummoned <HI>Pietrovits</HI> to appear, he, with his own
Hands, as &s;oon as they were all met, put the Ducal
Cap and Crown on his Head, with a Sceptre in his
Hand, and thus, attired in a very rich Robe, &s;et him
upon a Throne, in the Pre&s;ence of all the Court;
where having &s;hewed him the &s;ame Revernce as is
u&s;ually paid to the Czars of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> he &s;poke thus
to him; <HI>All Hail to our Great Duke and Monarch of</HI>
Ru&s;&s;ia: <HI>Now thou hast obtained what thou &s;o much de&s;i|redst;
now it is, thou hast encompa&s;&s;ed thy Wi&s;h. I
knew thy Aim was, to &s;upply my Place, in the Throne of</HI>
Mu&s;covy: <HI>See how I have, my &s;elf, created thee Great
Duke of</HI> Ru&s;&s;ia, <HI>in a most &s;olemn manner. But know&punc;
that as it was in my Power to &s;et thee upon the Throne, &s;o
I am able to dethrone and de&s;poil thee of that Dignity, as
Plea&s;ure.</HI> He had no &s;ooner uttered the&s;e la&s;t Words,
but he &s;tabbed him with a Dagger, &s;everal times,
through the Heart. But this was only the Prologue
to the following Tragedy; for he did not only com|mand
all his Servants to be either &s;trangled or drown|ed,
but he went in Per&s;on to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Columna,</HI>
180 Miles di&s;tant from the City of <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> and for|merly
belonging to <HI>Pietrovits;</HI> where 300 of his
Va&s;&s;als were ma&s;&s;acred in the Tyrant's Pre&s;ence.
But not &s;atisfied with this, after he had, for a whole
Year together, ruined his E&s;tate with Fire and Sword,
he &s;hut up all the Gentlemen (of whom there was a
con&s;iderable Number) that held any Lands under
<HI>Pietrovits,</HI> in one Hou&s;e, and &s;o blew them up into
the Air, with Gun-Powder: Their Wives and
Daughters, after they had been ravi&s;hed by his
Guards, were cut to pieces. The Pea&s;ants, with
their Wives and Children, were driven, &s;tark naked,
into the Woods. The Wife of <HI>Pietrovits</HI> was &s;hut
<PB N="335" REF="126">
up in a Mona&s;tery; and his Children, and whole
Family, de&s;troyed, by the Tyrant's Order.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Year he cau&s;ed his Chancellor, <HI>Koza|rin
Dubrowski,</HI> to be &s;lain by his Guards, with two of
his Sons, as they were &s;itting at Dinner; and a third
Son happening not to be at home, e&s;caped pre&s;ent
Death for that time; but he was afterwards taken,
and Quartered alive.</P>
<P><HI>Boris Titow,</HI> one of his Chief Coun&s;ellors of State,
coming one Day to pay his Reverence, as is u&s;ual,
to the Great Duke; as he was bowing his Head, he
cut off one of his Ears, with his own Hands; and
pre&s;enting it to the Owner, <HI>Accept,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>of this
&s;mall Gift at pre&s;ent: Another time I will remember you
better.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Cruelites exerci&s;ed on Per&s;ons of &s;o emi|nent
a Rank, &s;truck &s;uch a Terrour into the re&s;t of
the Nobility, that they were re&s;olved to try their ut|mo&s;t,
whether perhaps they might not be able to di|vert
him from the&s;e cruel De&s;igns. Being therefore
met at a certain Day, to the Number of 300, they
went all in a Body, to repre&s;ent to the Czar the
Heinou&s;ne&s;s of his Cruelties; telling him, <HI>That they
were ready to &s;acrifice both their Lives and E&s;tates for
his Service; and that they would always remain &s;tedfa&s;t
in their Allegiance: But, on the other hand, they hoped
he would be plea&s;ed not to afflict, in &s;o horrible a manner,
his faithful and innocent Subjects.</HI></P>
<P>The Grand Duke being not well plea&s;ed at their
Errand, he ordered them, all together, to be thrown
into Pri&s;on; and &s;ome Days after, &s;ome to have
their Tongues, others their Legs and Arms cut off;
and 50 of the mo&s;t Eminent among them were whip|ped
round the Market-place; the re&s;t were di&s;mi&s;|&s;ed
without any Puni&s;hment for that time, but they
paid afterwards the whole Score, with Intere&s;t: For,
in the Year 1570, one Morning, when the Citizens
were opening their Shops, they were not a little &s;ur|prized
to &s;ee 18 Gibbets erected in the Market-place,
&s;urrounded by the Great Duke's Guards, who
had brought along with them all manner of In&s;tru|ments
<PB N="336" REF="127">
for the Torture&punc; be&s;ides which, there was a
great Fire, and over it was placed a great Caldron,
with boiling hot Water in it. The Citizens, I &s;ay,
being terrified at &s;o horrible a Spectacle, and pre&s;a|ging
nothing but the wor&s;t to them&s;elves, as being
uncertain for what End all the&s;e dreadful Prepara|tions
were made, &s;ome in&s;tantly &s;hut up their Shops
again; others, more fearful than the re&s;t, left all
what they had, as it was, and were for &s;aving them|&s;elves
by Flight, or, at lea&s;t, for hiding in &s;ome more
remote Part of the City; Which Place being thus
put into a general Con&s;ternation, the Great Duke,
&s;urrounded by a great Number of his Guards, ap|peared
in the Market-place, &s;eating him&s;elf near the
Caldron of boiling Water. But perceiving that the
Generality of the Citizens had; out of Fear, either
abandon'd their Hou&s;es, or, at lea&s;t, ab&s;conded, and
di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves into the other Quarters of the
the City, he rid in Per&s;on through the Streets, cry|ing
out to them; <HI>Let nothing di&s;turb you: Come, and
&s;ee what I am going to do: I give you my Word, that no|thing
&s;hall hurt you; you may come forth, without the
least Danger to your &s;elves: Therefore come forth, and
&s;ee what a Spectacle I am preparing for you.</HI> The Peo|ple,
partly out of Fear, partly out of Curio&s;ity,
flocked to the Market-place, where they &s;aw 400
Noble-men, of the mo&s;t antient Families in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI>
coupled together, Two and Two, like Hounds;
and &s;o mi&s;erably disfigured by the Violence of the
Torture, that they were almo&s;t not to be known by
their neare&s;t Kindred. To gratifie in &s;ome mea&s;ure
the People, he &s;elected 180 out of their Number:
<HI>Vnto the&s;e,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>I give their Lives, for your &s;akes;
I will pardon them all their Offences: Let them be pre|&s;ently
di&s;charged.</HI> Which being done accordingly,</P>
<P>The fir&s;t that was brought forth to Execution, was
<HI>John Michaelovits Wiskowaty,</HI> his Chancellor; de&s;cen|ded
from one of the mo&s;t antient Families in <HI>Mu&s;co|vy:</HI>
Who being charged with Keeping great Corre|&s;pondence
with the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and inviting the
<HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> to invade <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> when he was
<PB N="337" REF="127">
ju&s;t going to be put on one of the Gibbets, he &s;poke the&s;e
following Words: <HI>I call God Almighty, the Infallible
Searcher of Hearts, to witne&s;s of what I am going to &s;ay,
to be true: I confe&s;s my &s;elf, before him, to be a mi&s;erable
Sword<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">; and trust in his Mercy, through the Blood of his
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> beloved Son. But as to what concerns the Station
I was lately in, by the Great Duke's Favour, I protest to
God, that I have always di&s;charged my Trust faithfully,
as I ought to do, towards him; and therefore I appeal at
this In&s;tant to the Tribunal of God, where, when I &s;hall
meet the Duke, I will make my Innocence appear to the
Great Judge of Heaven and Earth. I am &s;en&s;ible that,
O Duke, &s;uch is thy Ambition, &s;uch is thy Avarice and
Thirst after innocent Blood, that nothing but my Life can
&s;atisfie thee at pre&s;ent: Glut thy &s;elf therefore with inno|cent
Blood; but remember that thou must one Day give
a most &s;evere Account of all the&s;e most barbarous Cruel|ties.</HI>
Whil&s;t he was going on in his Di&s;cour&s;e, the
Executioner, by the Great Duke's Order, tied him
up to one of the Gibbets, with his Feet upwards,
and his Head hanging down. This done, one of
the Captains of his Guards asked him what he would
have farther done with this Malefactor? <HI>Every one
of you,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>that belong to my Court, here pre&s;ent,
&s;hall lend an helping Hand to &s;end this Traytor out of the
World, whom I will have cut Limb by Limb.</HI> He had
no &s;ooner &s;poke the Word, but the fir&s;t Captain of
his Guards, called <HI>Molutlo,</HI> di&s;mounting his Hor&s;e, he,
with a little Knife, cut off his Right Ear; the Se|cond,
his Left; the Third, his Lips; and &s;o every
one, in their Turn, the re&s;t of his Limbs. The Se|cretary
of the Grand Duke being al&s;o to have his
Share in the Execution, at la&s;t cut off his Privy
Members; of which he immediately died: Which
the Duke perceiving, and believing that it had been
done on purpo&s;e to &s;horten the Chancellor's Mi&s;ery,
he ordered him to eat them in&s;tantly; which he was
forced to do.</P>
<P>The dead Body of the Chancellor being taken
from the Gibbet, and cut into &s;mall pieces, the
next that was brought upon the Scaffold, was
<PB N="338" REF="128">
<HI>Michael Tum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">chow,</HI> the Lord High Trea&s;urer of <HI>Mu&s;|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">y,</HI>
for no other rea&s;on but that he had been an
intimate Friend of the Chancellors; he was very
&s;hort in his Expre&s;&s;ions, &s;aying only the&s;e Words:
<HI>I appeal to God, from whom nothing can be hidde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
I never was guilty of any tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t&punc; my Lord and
Ma&s;ter, and that I have faithfully, and without any
fraud, di&s;charged my Office; wherefore, I &s;ummon thee,
O Great Duke, to appear on the la&s;t day of Judgment,
before the Tribunal of God, where thou &s;halt be obliged to
make ample &s;atisfaction to me.</HI> Having ended the&s;e
Words, he was tied up to the Gibbet, in the &s;ame
manner as the Chancellor with his Head downwards,
and very clo&s;e &s;haved: After he had hung thus for
&s;ome time, two of the Captains of his Guards, each
with a bucket of Water; whereof one was Cold,
the other fill'd out of the Chaldron with Boiling
Water, we mentioned before, approached to the
Gibbet, and he with the cold Water, having fir&s;t
wa&s;hed his Head, the other continually poured the
Boiling hot Water upon it, till the Skin was quite
&s;hriveled together, and the poor Trea&s;urer at la&s;t
died in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Torments.
The third in order was his Cook, who underwent
the &s;ame Fate as the Chancellor, being cut to pieces
Limb by Limb.</P>
<P>After the&s;e, follow three of the Great Duke's
chief Secretaries, <HI>George Czapkinou, John Buthakow,</HI>
and <HI>Ba&s;ili Stepanow;</HI> the&s;e were all together with
their Wives and Children cut in pieces, in the Great
Duke's pre&s;ence, by his Guards: At la&s;t, two hun|dred
of the&s;e Noble Men we &s;poke of before, were
brought before the Great Duke upon the Scaffold;
who having Condem'd them to Die, without as much
as naming their Crime, they were in an in&s;tant cut
to pieces by his Guards before his Face. To con|clude
the Tragedy, the Great Duke ordered to be
brought before him out of Pri&s;on (where he had
been detained a great while) a certain per&s;on vene|rable
for his Old Age and Nobility, as being extra|cted
from a very ancient Family, whom he run
<PB N="339" REF="128">
through the Body with his own Lance, and not &s;a|tisfied
with that, after the Old Man lay upon the
Ground, wallowing in his Blood, gave him at lea&s;t
Fifteen or Sixteen Wounds more, till he died upon
the Spot.</P>
<P>This Spectacle having thus continued for four
Hours, the Tyrant before he returned to the Ca&s;tle,
would needs give a Vi&s;it to the Widow of the Trea|&s;urer,
whom he had cau&s;ed to be executed ju&s;t be|fore.
She was Si&s;ter to the Duke <HI>Wiazinski,</HI> and one
of the hand&s;ome&s;t Ladies in all <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> whom he
found &s;hut up in her Bed-chamber, all over whelm|ed
with Grief, and lamenting the mi&s;erable Death of
her Husband in Terms &s;o Pa&s;&s;ionate, that it would
have moved Compa&s;&s;ion in a heart of Stone. But
the Tyrant being void of all &s;en&s;e of Humanity, no
&s;ooner entred the Hou&s;e, but ordered her to be
&s;tript &s;tark Naked, and to be &s;et with her bare But|tocks
upon a Rope, fa&s;tned titely for that purpo&s;e
betwixt two Po&s;ts, and &s;o to be drawn upon the
Rope, till the tender Fle&s;h of this Pretty Creature,
not being able to re&s;i&s;t long the violence of this moti|on,
was torn every where to the very Bones, of which
&s;he died &s;ome days after. She had a little Daugh|ter
and Son, who had been forced to be the mourn|ful
Spectators of their dear Mothers Mi&s;ery; the
fir&s;t was &s;ent into a Nunnery, the la&s;t Condemned
to a perpetual Puni&s;hment. The Chancellor's Wi|dow
was al&s;o forced to embrace the Mona&s;tick Life,
and his Son &s;ent Pri&s;oner to the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Biel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">jezoro,</HI>
which lies in one of the <HI>Northern</HI> and mo&s;t unfrequen|ted
Provinces of <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> Some days after this
Slaughter, about Four&s;core of the Wives and
Daughters of the&s;e two Hundred Nobles, he had
cau&s;ed to be Butchered before his Face, where drag|ged
by the Hair, to the River &s;ide, where they were
all drowned. About the &s;ame time, one of his Se|cretaries
having been pre&s;ented with a Pike by a
certain Countryman, the Great Duke having got
Notice of it, cau&s;ed him to be thrown into a Lake,
where, as he &s;aid, he might have Fi&s;h enough, &s;ince
he was &s;o great a lover of them.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="129">
The <HI>Lithuanians</HI> having by a &s;tratagem &s;urpri&s;ed
the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Borsko,</HI> took the Governour and his
Lady Pri&s;oners, who being afterwards exchanged
with &s;ome <HI>Poles,</HI> returned to the City of <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI>
where they were no &s;ooner Arrived, but the Great
Duke ordered three Gibbots to be Erected, on which
the Governor, and two more of his chief Officers
being fa&s;tned with a Rope about their Wa&s;tes, the
Tyrant and his Son &s;hot their Arrows at them till
they were killed, telling them, ever now and than,
<HI>Thus you ought to have defended your Cau&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>His own Brother, though he had lived all along
with the greate&s;t Circum&s;pection in the World, for
fear of giving any occa&s;ion of Jealou&s;ie to the Ty|rant,
yet could not e&s;cape his hands. For under
pretence that one of his <HI>Bojares,</HI> called <HI>Trzeriack Wis|konati,</HI>
had given information again&s;t him, he cau&s;|ed
him, without being heard, to be tortured in the
mo&s;t violent manner that could be invented; and
thus having forced him to make a Confe&s;&s;ion where
his Trea&s;ure was hid, his Head was cut off in the
pre&s;ence of his Lady, who all this while lay pro|&s;trate
at the Tyrant's Feet, and in vain was implo|ring
his Clemency: But in&s;tead of lending a favour|able
Ear to her ju&s;t Petition, &s;he was &s;tript &s;tark Na|ked,
expo&s;ed to the view of the whole Court, and
afterwards dragged to the River and drown'd.</P>
<P>It u&s;ed to be a common Cu&s;tom with him, to
make Ladies of the greate&s;t Qualities to &s;tand Na|ked
before him, and if he took any liking to them,
after he had abu&s;ed them him&s;elf, to expo&s;e them to
the Officers of his Guards, and afterwards cau&s;e them
to be hanged at their own Doors, where the Hus|band
was to go out and in, perhaps for three or four
Weeks, till the Tyrant was plea&s;ed to order the
dead Body to be removed. He was &s;omething more
favourable to a certain merry Crew of <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and
other Women Foreigners, who had, as it &s;eems,
laugh'd at &s;ome of his Prancks, which he u&s;ed to play
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> certain times, when he was in a good Humour;
which he taking Notice of, they were all &s;ent for to

the Palace; where, after they were all &s;tripp'd &s;tark
Naked, in a very large Room, he Commanded &s;eve|ral
Bu&s;hels of Pea&s;e to be thrown down before them,
which he made them pick up: When he had done,
he treated them with &s;ome Wine, and bid them to
take heed for the future, how they made &s;port with
&s;o great an Emperor. Perhaps, having been u&s;ed to
take a view of the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Ladies, he took this op|portunity
to &s;ee how far the Foreign Women differed
in Shape from his own Country-Ladies.</P>
<P>After he had, in a manner, thus either ruin'd, or
quite de&s;troyed all the mo&s;t antient Families of <HI>Mu&s;|covy,</HI>
he turned his Fury again&s;t the <HI>Poli&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Li|thuanian</HI>
Captives, of whom he had a great Num|ber:
Some of the&s;e were &s;lain by his own Hand;
the re&s;t, to the Number of &s;ome Thou&s;ands, Men,
Women and Children, were, by his Order, cut in
Pieces, or thrown into the River. His Cruelties

not to be parallel'd in Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Of the Barbarities committed in the City of <HI>Novogo|rod,</HI>
we have &s;poken in the De&s;cription of that City;
&s;o that it will be &s;uperfluous, to give a further Ac|count
of them here: We will only add thus much,
That, as he exceeded all the Tyrants that ever were
infamous for their Cruelties, &s;o it was he that perfect|ed
the Work begun by his Grand-father: to wit, by
&s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Antient Nobility, to make him&s;elf ab|&s;olute
Ma&s;ter of this great Empire: Which when he
had obtained, he grew al&s;o in&s;upportable to Sove|reign
Princes. How he treated the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Lithua|nian</HI>
Captives, we have related before; and his Am|bition
being unmea&s;urable, he gave a proof of it to a
<HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador; who having put on his Hat in his
Pre&s;ence, he cau&s;ed it to be Nailed to his Head. Sir
<HI>Jerom Bowes</HI> having, not long after, been &s;ent by
Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> as Amba&s;&s;ador to him, he not on|ly
put on his Hat, but al&s;o cockt it before him. At
which Boldne&s;s, the Tyrant being &s;omewhat &s;tart|led,
asked him, Whether he were ignorant how he

any Affront put upon her Mini&s;ters.</HI> The Great Duke
was &s;o far from being di&s;plea&s;ed with this bold An|&s;wer,
that ever after he had a great e&s;teem for him;
telling his <HI>Bojares,</HI> That he que&s;tioned whether, a|mong
them all, there was one that dare do &s;o much
for him. It was in his Reign that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ettled
fir&s;t their Trade in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> as we have mentioned
in the De&s;cription of the City of <HI>Archangel.</HI> He
had three Sons; of which, the Elde&s;t being &s;truck by
his Father one time, with a &s;tick, died with Grief;
or, as &s;ome will have it, by his Father's Lance: The
two others were, <HI>Fedor,</HI> or <HI>Theodor,</HI> and <HI>Demetrius;</HI> the
Elde&s;t of which &s;ucceeded him in the Empire. He
Reigned Nine and Thirty Years, and died in the

of that Great Tyrant, John Ba&s;ilovits, to

<P><HI>JOhn Ba&s;ilovits</HI> had by <HI>Ana&s;ta&s;ia,</HI> his fir&s;t La|dy,

the Cu&s;tom of <HI>Mu&s;covy)</HI> but his Affection and
Endearments of this Lady, being more prevailing
with him than his Intere&s;t, he had by &s;everal De|lays,
put off the Execution of it. Being now

mounted on the Throne, and <HI>Boris</HI> advanced to
the Dignity of Lord High-Steward of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>
(the highe&s;t Station, next to the Prince in the Em|pire)
he knew how to manage the Affection of a
Prince, who always had preferr'd his private Plea|&s;ures
and Retirement, before Publick Affairs, with
&s;o much Dexterity, that the Prince&s;s, in a great
mea&s;ure, ow'd the continuance of her Greatne&s;s to
him, as he was ab&s;olutely beholding to her for his
fir&s;t Advancement.</P>
<P><HI>Boris Goudenou</HI> was a Man naturally qualified for
the Management of Affairs of State, and in a very
few Years had attained to that degree of
Perfection in Flattery and Di&s;&s;imulation, that he
&s;eem'd to be the Darling both of his Prince and
the People; both being equally well &s;atisfied in his
Conduct. Thus by the Advantages of his Quality
and Dexterity, and the Weakne&s;s of the Czar <HI>Fe|dor,</HI>
having got the whole Management of Affairs
into his own Hands, he began to bend all his
Thoughts, how to &s;ecure the Crown of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> to
him&s;elf and his Family; the better to enable him|&s;elf
to obtain his Ends, after he had gain'd the Af|fection
of the common People, he re&s;olved to
&s;mooth his way to the Throne, by the Favour of
the Nobility, mo&s;t of whom having a Dependance
from him, as the only Per&s;on, through who&s;e hands
all Places of Honour, Tru&s;t or Profit pa&s;&s;ed, were
&s;oon brought over by the Hopes and Advantages of
Preferments to his Party. Having thus laid the
Foundation to his projected Greatne&s;s, the main
Ob&s;tacle of his growing Ambition, was <HI>Demetrius,</HI>
the younge&s;t Son of <HI>John Ba&s;ilovits,</HI> by a &s;econd
Adventure, and Brother to the Czar <HI>Fedor Ivano|vits,</HI>
who was Educated under his Mothers care in
the Ca&s;tle of <HI>&V;gletz.</HI></P>
<P>His Death being therefore re&s;olved on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince <HI>De|metrius</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ur <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ered.</NOTE> four of
the Prince's own Dome&s;ticks were by va&s;t Promi|&s;es
engag'd to undertake the Fact. The better to
cover their De&s;ign, they &s;et at mid-night the City
of <HI>&V;gletz</HI> on Fire in &s;everal places, and having thus
<PB N="3" REF="133">
fill'd all with horror and confu&s;ion, they ran du|ring
the general Con&s;ternation to the Ca&s;tle, under
pretence of &s;aving the Prince; and being admitted
into his Bed-chamber, took their Opportunity,
while he was looking out of the Window, to &s;ee the
approaching Flame, and &s;tabb'd him in &s;everal
places with poy&s;on'd Daggers, and &s;o leaving him
wallowing in his own Blood, took Po&s;t for <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;|co,</HI>
flu&s;h'd with hopes of ample Rewards for &s;o
extraordinary piece of Service. But they were
grievou&s;ly mi&s;taken in their Account; for <HI>Boris Gou|denou,</HI>
con&s;idering with him&s;elf how dangerous
they might prove one time or another to his Af|fairs,
took a Re&s;olution to take the fir&s;t Opportunity
of ridding him&s;elf of the&s;e Evidences of his Trea|chery;
to effect which, he hir'd others, who by the
Temptations of great Rewards were made the Ex|ecutioners
of tho&s;e four Murderers of their
Prince.</P>
<P>To prevent the Murmurs of the People, who
were all &s;tartled at the &s;uddenne&s;s of &s;o bloody a
Tragedy, he made u&s;e of the &s;ame Method he had
done at <HI>&V;gletz;</HI> For, having cau&s;ed the City of
<HI>Mu&s;co</HI> to be &s;et on fire in &s;everal Parts, he did not
que&s;tion but that this general Con&s;ternation would
divert the Peoples Thoughts from enquiring into
the true Circum&s;tances of this Murther: And to
remove as far as po&s;&s;ibly could be from him&s;elf, all
Su&s;picion of having had the lea&s;t hand in &s;o barba|rous
a Murder, he declared, that he would revenge
the Death of the Prince <HI>Demetrius,</HI> upon the In|habitants
of <HI>&V;gletz.</HI> For, no &s;ooner was the fir&s;t
Con&s;ternation, occa&s;ioned by the Fire in that City,
a little over, but a Rumor being &s;pread, that the
Prince had been Murder'd, the Inhabitants forced
their Way into the Ca&s;tle, and tran&s;ported with a
furious Zeal of revenging his Death, &s;lew all his
Servants, without any di&s;tinction. This, which
in all probability &s;eem'd to clear them from the
Stain of the Fact, was by the Contrivance of <HI>Bo|ris,</HI>
interpreted to their De&s;truction; alledging,
<PB N="4" REF="134">
that they having &s;lain all tho&s;e from whom any In|qui&s;ition
might have been made concerning this A&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ination,
it would but be a &s;ufficient Argument
of their Guilt; and that the Murder being to be laid
at their door, they mu&s;t be proceeded again&s;t like
Criminals. In effect, a great many of the Citizens
of <HI>&V;gletz,</HI> were bani&s;h'd, &s;ome were tortur'd,
hang'd and drown'd; And not contented thus, af|ter
he had cau&s;ed the whole Court to go into Mourn|ing,
and recommended the Care of the Funebrial
Pomp, to <HI>Knez Ba&s;ili-zuski,</HI> he commanded the
Ca&s;tle of <HI>&V;gletz</HI> to be raz'd and levelled with the
Ground.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ignaliz'd his pretended Pa&s;&s;ion for
<HI>Demetrius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 span">.</NOTE> his next Care was to remove the only
remaining Ob&s;tacle to his Greatne&s;s, to wit, the
Grand-Czar <HI>Fedor,</HI> who&s;e End was ha&s;tned with
Poy&s;on, after he had reign'd twelve Years. The

Throne without any Reluctancy; but, after &s;he
had for &s;ome time labour'd under the weight of &s;o
va&s;t an Empire, whether &s;he was grown weary of
the Burthen, or that &s;he thought it more conveni|ent
to entail the Crown upon her Family, by tran&s;|&s;erring
it to her Brother, &s;he declared her &s;elf un|capable
of undergoing it any longer, and acquitting
her &s;elf of &s;o great a Charge; and, that &s;he, pre|ferring
the Contents of a private Life, before the
Toils of a Crown, was ready to re&s;ign all her Au|thority
into the Hands of the Nobility, which &s;he
did accordingly, in the Year&punc; 1597.</P>
<P><HI>Boris Goudenou,</HI> who was &s;ufficiently acquainted
with the mutinous Temper of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> when
freed from that Servile Yoak, which otherwi&s;e
keeps them under Subjection, and that mo&s;t
among the Nobles being rai&s;ed by, and dependent
<PB N="5" REF="134">
from his Favour, would not dare to lay hold of
the Government, was re&s;olved to improve the
general Con&s;ternation and Confu&s;ion of the Peo|ple
to his Advantage, being &s;en&s;ible that the No|bles
would be emulous, who &s;hould mo&s;t &s;hew his
Zeal in placing him upon the Throne. Finding
therefore the Nobility ready to make their Addre&s;&s;es
to him, he cunningly cau&s;ed a Rumor to be &s;pread
abroad by his Emi&s;&s;aries, that being tir'd with the
Toils of his Charge of Lord High Steward of <HI>Mu&s;|covy,</HI>
he was re&s;olved to quit it, by retiring
into a Mona&s;tery, to end the remainder of his Days
in quiet. The People being thus more and more
tran&s;ported with the Apprehen&s;ions of their Ruin,
when they perceived, that among all the Nobility,
there was not one who dur&s;t as much as to under|take
the Management of the Government, they
join'd with the Nobility, and the Clergy, who&s;e
chief Intere&s;t con&s;i&s;ted in maintaining the Publick
Peace, were of opinion, that all the States of the
Empire ought to make their humble Submi&s;&s;ions to
<HI>Boris,</HI> to try whether by their joint Importunities,
he might, perhaps, be prevail'd upon to take upon
him the Burthen of the Empire. The Nuns quit|ted
their Cloi&s;ters, and the Women ran with their
Children in their Arms, to back the E&s;tates of the
Empire, and to offer their mo&s;t humble Prayers to
<HI>Boris,</HI> like to the tutelar Saint of <HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> &s;o, that
being at la&s;t overcome by their Prayers and La|mentations,
he yielded to the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of
his Country; and, after he had &s;poken much in
prai&s;e of a retir'd Life, he prote&s;ted to them, That
<HI>it was not to the Honour and Greatne&s;s of his Hou&s;e,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bori Gou|denou</HI> ac|cepts of the Crown of <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI></NOTE>
<HI>but meerly to their Importunities, and the Love of his
Country, that he was going to &s;acrifice all the Satisfa|ction
he found in a retir'd Life, and that the only mo|tive,
which made him offer Violence to his own Inclina|tions,
was, that he could not &s;ee any longer &s;o glorious
an Empire, expo&s;ed to the imminent Danger of ap|proaching
Ruin; But knowing him&s;elf too weak for
&s;o great a Burthen, he hoped that they would not deny
<PB N="6" REF="135">
to Aid him with their Coun&s;els, when Occa&s;ion &s;hould
require; and that relying upon their Honour and Judg|ment,
he would chearfully receive the Tru&s;t, which he
would be ready to Maintain and Defend to the la&s;t Drop
of his Blood, a&s;&s;uring them, that if he could not equal his
Predece&s;&s;ors in Greatne&s;s and Glorious Actions abroad,
he would endeavour to exceed them in Temperance and
the Mildne&s;s of his Government.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that <HI>Boris</HI> did &s;hew no le&s;s
Conduct and Wi&s;dom in pre&s;erving the Crown,
than he had u&s;ed dexterity in acquiring it. For he
entirely engag'd the Army to his Service by great
Rewards, he continued the Nobility in their for|mer
Dignities, and heap'd upon them new Favours
and Preferments; The common People he ty'd to
his Intere&s;t, by ea&s;ing them of their Taxes, and
the Mildne&s;s of his Government; and having thus
&s;ecur'd the Affections of his Subjects at home, he
was no le&s;s careful of E&s;tabli&s;hing a good Intelli|gence
abroad with the Neighbouring Princes, for
which purpo&s;es, new Treaties were &s;et on foot,
and concluded betwixt him and the <HI>Poles, Swedes,</HI>
and other Nations, bordering upon <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> Thus
the whole Intere&s;t of his Government &s;eem'd, in
all human Appearance, to be built upon &s;o &s;olid a
Foundation, that no power upon Earth was like to
overturn it, as being founded upon the general
Affections of the People at home under the Ma|nagement
of a Prince, who, for his Wi&s;dom, Ex|perience
and Courage, was look'd upon abroad, as
one of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing Princes, that ever a|&s;cended
the Throne of this va&s;t Empire.</P>
<P>But mark the &s;udden Change of all humane Af|fairs,
how &s;ubject to continual Vici&s;&s;itudes. What
perhaps the mo&s;t powerful Foreign Enemy dur&s;t
&s;carce have attempted at that Juncture of Time,
was effected by a poor incon&s;iderable Monk, who by
his Devices put the whole <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Empire into &s;uch
a Confu&s;ion, that, in &s;pite of all the Precautions of
<HI>Boris,</HI> he broke all his Mea&s;ures, and brought the

he was de&s;cended from a very noble but

&s;ent to the Mona&s;tery of <HI>Trinouka,</HI> to cor|rect
his Extravagancies by the Retiredne&s;s of a Mo|na&s;tick

and his outward Behaviour and whole Per&s;on &s;uita|ble
to his great Genius; and this Confinement not

a deep Melancholy. A certain old cunning Monk
of the &s;ame Mona&s;tery, who was a &s;ecret Enemy
of the then Great Duke <HI>Boris Goudenou,</HI> having ta|ken
notice of it, and judging that the Cau&s;e of his
Sadne&s;s proceeded from his pre&s;ent Confinement,
the Narrowne&s;s of a Mona&s;tick Life not being any
wi&s;e &s;uitable to his capacious Soul, contracted an
intimate Friend&s;hip with him, endeavouring to di|vert
his Pen&s;iven&s;s by the In&s;tructions he gave him,
fir&s;t, concerning the Ancient State of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI>
Empire, and afterwards by giving him a full Re|lation
of the pre&s;ent Po&s;ture of Affairs under the
U&s;urpation of <HI>Boris Goudenou.</HI> Being not unac|quainted
with the Treacheries by which <HI>Boris</HI> had
compa&s;&s;ed his Aim, he did not forget to tell him,
how he had cau&s;ed <HI>Demetrius</HI> the younge&s;t Son of
<HI>John Ba&s;ilovits</HI> to be murthered at <HI>&V;gletz,</HI> how the
Grand Duke <HI>Fedor,</HI> the Elder Brother of <HI>Deme|trius,</HI>
was poi&s;on'd by his Contrivances; and that
by the Murther of the&s;e two Princes, as by &s;o ma|ny
&s;teps he had a&s;cended the Throne. He told him,
that though his Intere&s;t was laid deep at pre&s;ent in
the Nobility, yet that there were not wanting &s;uch
among them, as, being &s;en&s;ible of the Treachery
committed again&s;t the two Princes, and envying
his Greatne&s;s, would not Refu&s;e to embrace the
fir&s;t Opportunity that offer'd to expo&s;e his treache|rous
De&s;igns to the View of the World, which be|ing
once done, would &s;oon turn the Affection of
the common People into a mortal Hatred again&s;t
him. He cunningly in&s;inuated to the young Monk,
<PB N="8" REF="137">
That his Per&s;on and A&s;pect, being not much diffe|rent
from that of Prince <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and his Genius
&s;itted for great Undertakings, it would be no diffi|cult
Task for him to per&s;onate the true <HI>Demetrius,</HI>
(whom they would give out to have been &s;aved

at once, to puni&s;h the Treachery of <HI>Boris,</HI> and to
&s;upply the Place of Prince <HI>Demetrius</HI> in the Throne
of <HI>Mu&s;covy. Grisko,</HI> who was naturally of an A&s;|piring

the Old Monk with a great deal of Satisfaction, they
began to concert Mea&s;ures, which way to put their

who by the Pro&s;pect of great Advantages might be
drawn into his Intere&s;t, publickly lay claim to the
Crown of <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> Pur&s;uant to this Re&s;olution,
the Old Monk, with his Pupil, travelled towards
the Palatinate of <HI>Kiovia</HI> bordering upon <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI>
where having introduc'd him into the Service of a
Per&s;on of very eminent Quality and Intere&s;t in
tho&s;e Parts, who&s;e Name was <HI>Adam Wi&s;nowiski,</HI>
and given him &s;uch further In&s;tructions, as he
thought mo&s;t conducing towards the Accompli&s;h|ment
of their De&s;ign, he return'd into <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> in or|der
to prepare the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> for the Reception of
this <HI>Demetrius</HI> as &s;oon as he &s;hould be in a Capacity
to appear at the Head of a con&s;iderable Party up|on
their Borders. To effect this, he got it whi|&s;pered
about, That Prince <HI>Demetrius,</HI> the younge&s;t
Son of <HI>John Ba&s;ilovits,</HI> was &s;till living, that his Mo|ther
having got timely Notice of the De&s;ign of <HI>Boris</HI>
again&s;t his Life, had cau&s;ed him &s;ecretly to be con|veyed
a way from <HI>&V;gletz</HI> to a place of Safety, and, in
<PB N="9" REF="137">
his &s;tead, had provided another Child much of the
&s;ame Age, which had been murther'd in&s;tead of the
Prince <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who, as he gave it out, was then
in <HI>Poland,</HI> making great Preparations for the Reco|very

<P><HI>Whil&s;t the Old Monk was thus preparing the

his intended Di&s;covery, which &s;oon after of|fer'd
it &s;elf, when he lea&s;t expected it. For</HI> Wi&s;nowiski
<HI>being in a violent Pa&s;&s;ion one day, not only call'd
him a Son of a Whore, but al&s;o &s;econded his Words
with &s;ome Blows; which Occa&s;ion</HI> Grisko <HI>taking

his Eyes;</HI> You would not, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> my Lord, treat
me thus, if you were as well acquainted with my

that I &s;hould receive this Affront from the Man in

he was turning away, from</HI> Wi&s;nowiski, <HI>who being

Grisko Otropeja, <HI>being not unprepared with an An|&s;wer,
told him, with a well-compo&s;ed Countenance.</HI>
The &s;ame Confidence which &s;wayed me to put my

to you, which otherwi&s;e ought to be kept concealed
in my own Brea&s;t: Know then, that <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> is my
Native Country, that the Great Duke <HI>John Ba&s;ilovits</HI>

in my &s;tead. I have ever &s;ince lain conceal'd in a
Mona&s;tery, till prompted by a ju&s;t Ambition of Re|covering
my Right, I took a Re&s;olution to &s;eek for
Aid abroad again&s;t the &V;&s;urper of my Throne, the
Murtherer of my Brother <HI>Fedor</HI> the late Great Duke,
and my mortal Enemy. <HI>He &s;hew'd him al&s;o a Cro&s;s
richly be&s;et with Diamonds, which he pull'd out of
his Bo&s;om:</HI> This, <HI>&s;aid he,</HI> is the only Remnant of my
former Greatne&s;s, and the dear Pledge of my Mo|thers
Love; and, &s;ince I have freely tru&s;ted you with

thereby made you Ma&s;ter both of my Life and For|tune,
I live in hopes that you will not refu&s;e me your
generous A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Recovery of my Father's
Throne, which I &s;hall always be ready to acknowledge
to the utmo&s;t of my Power. Demetrius <HI>was a Per&s;on

much above his Years; and being, be&s;ides
this, of a very hand&s;om A&s;pect; this, with the

Old Monk, fir&s;t put</HI> Wi&s;nowiski <HI>under a great A|&s;toni&s;hment;
but having &s;oon recollected him&s;elf,
he a thou&s;and times asked his Pardon for the Faults
committed again&s;t a Per&s;on of his eminent Rank,
with a Promi&s;e that he would endeavour to ex|piate
the &s;ame by his future Services for his In|tere&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Scarce a few Days were pa&s;t before <HI>Wi&s;nowiski</HI>

<P>This &s;udden Change in the Court of <HI>Wi&s;nowiski,</HI>
being &s;oon &s;pread abroad, as well in <HI>Poland</HI> as in <HI>Mu&s;|covy,</HI>
as it &s;erved for a &s;trong Confirmation of what
had been whi&s;pered about by the Contrivances of
the Old Monk, &s;o it was not long before it reached
the Ears of <HI>Boris Goudenou.</HI> He &s;oon took the A|larm
<PB N="11" REF="138">
at &s;o unexpected and &s;urprizing a piece of
News, and thinking it mo&s;t advi&s;able to &s;tifle this
Mon&s;ter in the Birth, he immediately di&s;patch'd a|way
a Me&s;&s;enger to the Duke <HI>Wi&s;nowiski,</HI> with
Orders to inform him of the Impo&s;ture put upon
him by this pretended <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and how unbecom|ing
his Quality it would be, to e&s;pou&s;e the Cau&s;e of
an Impo&s;tor, again&s;t a Legal Prince; neither was
he &s;paring in his Promi&s;es, offering not only va&s;t
Sums of Money, but al&s;o con&s;iderable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to
that Duke, if he would &s;urrender him dead or
alive into his Hands. But this had a quite contrary
Effect upon <HI>Wi&s;nowiski,</HI> who, being in &s;ome doubt
before, concerning this <HI>Demetrius,</HI> was now, by the
great Offers made by <HI>Boris,</HI> entirely confirmed in
his Opinion, that he mu&s;t needs be the true
<HI>Demetrius;</HI> and therefore renewed his former
Re&s;olution of Adhering to his Intere&s;t, maugre
all the Temptations of <HI>Boris Goudenou.</HI> But
having wi&s;ely con&s;idered with them&s;elves, that
he would leave nothing unattempted on his
&s;ide, which might facilitate the De&s;truction of <HI>De|metrius,</HI>
it was judged mo&s;t advi&s;able not, to expo&s;e
his Per&s;on any longer &s;o near the borders of <HI>Mu&s;|covy,</HI>
as was the Duke's Hou&s;e, but to retire to
<HI>Wi&s;nowiski,</HI> a certain place well fortified, and more
remo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e from the Frontiers, belonging to the Duke
<HI>Wi&s;nowiski,</HI> who, in the mean while returned to
his own Hou&s;e, to get the better Intelligence of
what pa&s;t in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> Here he was met by ano|ther
Me&s;&s;enger from the Great Duke, <HI>Boris Goude|nou,</HI>
who not only by his Ma&s;ter's Orders, renew'd
his former Offers, but al&s;o promi&s;ed more ample
Rewards, if he would &s;urrender the Counterfeit
<HI>Demetrius,</HI> either dead or alive. But this Me&s;&s;en|ger
meeting with no better Succe&s;s than the for|mer,
he received &s;ecret In&s;tructions to endeavour
the De&s;truction of this Impo&s;tor, at what rate &s;o|ever,
not to be &s;paring of Dagger or Poy&s;on, great
Rewards or any thing el&s;e which might contribute
to his Ruin.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="139">
This was not &s;o &s;ecretly carried on, but that <HI>Wi&s;|nowiski</HI>
had got &s;ome Scent of the De&s;ign laid a|gain&s;t
the Life of his Friend; wherefore thinking
him not &s;ufficiently &s;ecured again&s;t the Attempts of
the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> in that place; e&s;pecially, &s;ince they
had drawn together a con&s;iderable Force upon the
Frontiers, it was re&s;olved to &s;end him to <HI>George
Mni&s;zeck,</HI> Waywode of <HI>Sendomiria,</HI> the Duke's
particular Friend, which would both put him out
of the reach of his Enemies, and probably, &s;treng|then
his Preten&s;ions with the Intere&s;t of one of the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable Men in all <HI>Poland.</HI> Pur&s;uant to
this Re&s;olution, <HI>Demetrius</HI> being provided with
Letters of Recommendation from <HI>Wi&s;nowiski,</HI> went
to the Weywode of <HI>Sendomiria</HI>'s Hou&s;e, by whom
he was received with all the Honour imaginable,
due to his pretended Quality.</P>
<P><HI>Demetrius</HI> being now at lei&s;ure to make &s;eri|ous
Reflections upon the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of his Af|fairs,
had no rea&s;on to be di&s;&s;atisfied with his Con|dition,
as being not without hopes of encompa&s;|&s;ing
his End, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch powerful
Friends; but wi&s;ely con&s;idering with him&s;elf, that
their fir&s;t Heat might, by degrees, grow weak, if
not quite become cool, if not &s;u&s;tained by &s;uffici|ent
Fuel to nouri&s;h it, he employed all his Thoughts
to e&s;tabli&s;h, by &s;ome means or other, his Fortune,
upon a more &s;olid Foundation, than that of bare
Friend&s;hip. He was &s;en&s;ible, that the Per&s;ons,
among whom he now lived, and from whom he
chiefly rely'd in reference to his Grand De&s;ign, were
all Zealous <HI>Roman Catholicks,</HI> he very well fore&s;aw,
that if he expected to be back'd by them in his
Preten&s;ions, he ought at lea&s;t, to &s;hew &s;ome Incli|nation
to the &s;ame Faith, without which&punc; he judg|ed
that their Friend&s;hip would be very un&s;table.
To obtain therefore this End, he thought it mo&s;t
convenient to make his Applications to the Je&s;uites,
whom, by rea&s;on of their great Zeal for the <HI>Roman
Catholick</HI> Cau&s;e, and the free Acce&s;s and Influence
they have over Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Quality, he
<PB N="13" REF="139">
knew to be the mo&s;t proper In&s;truments for the
managing of his De&s;ign. <HI>Demetrius</HI> therefore,
having given them &s;ome a&s;&s;urances of his Inclina|tions
towards that Religion they profe&s;&s;ed; the&s;e
Fathers being over-joy'd at the pro&s;pect of &s;o great
a Pro&s;elyte; under who&s;e Protection, they pro|mi&s;ed
them&s;elves one day to join one of the mo&s;t
Potent Kingdoms in the World to the Papal Chair,
were not negligent in their Duty, but readily offer|ed
both their Coun&s;els and real A&s;&s;i&s;tance to <HI>Deme|trius.</HI>
After they had frequently di&s;cours'd him
concerning the Chief Articles of Faith, in Di&s;pute
betwixt the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Church,
and given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch further In&s;tructions, as they
judged mo&s;t convenient for their pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e,
they were al&s;o not wanting in their Advice towards
the promoting of his main De&s;ign.</P>
<P>They propo&s;ed to him a Marriage with <HI>Marina,</HI>
the Daughter of <HI>George Mni&s;zeck,</HI> Weywode of
<HI>Sendomiria,</HI> who entertain'd him at that time in his
Hou&s;e; &s;he was a Lady young and &s;prightly, and
the Je&s;uits knowing her be&s;ides this, to be of a very
haughty Temper&punc; they did not que&s;tion, but that
the pro&s;pect of a Crown would be temptation too
powerful for her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">o re&s;i&s;t; which would at once
&s;trengthen his Intere&s;t in <HI>Poland,</HI> and remove all
further Doubts, among the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> and <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI>
of his being the true <HI>Demetrius,</HI> Son of the Great
Duke, <HI>John Ba&s;ilovits.</HI> They repre&s;ented to him,
that <HI>Boris Goudenon,</HI> being a great Politician, had
&s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf in the Throne of
<HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> that without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch a Per|&s;on
as the Weywode of <HI>Sendomiria,</HI> it would be
impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;hake his Intere&s;t; that they
knew the Weywode to be one of the mo&s;t ambiti|ous
Men in the World; and that therefore, if he
could conde&s;cend to enter with him into a more
&s;trict Alliance, by Marrying his Daughter, it would
be the mo&s;t powerful Motive to engage him ab&s;o|lutely
into his Intere&s;t. They advi&s;ed him there|fore,
to make his Addre&s;&s;es fir&s;t to <HI>Marina,</HI> and
<PB N="14" REF="140">
after he had &s;ounded her Inclinations, to offer the
&s;ame Propo&s;ition to her Father, when they would
be &s;ure to back his Preten&s;ions with all the Inte|re&s;t
they had.</P>
<P><HI>Demetrius,</HI> who had already been touch'd by the
&s;parkling Eyes of <HI>Marina,</HI> receiv'd this Propo&s;i|tion
of the Je&s;uits, with the utmo&s;t Satisfaction;
and being &s;purr'd on by a double Motive, to wit,
that of his Love and Intere&s;t, he &s;ought only for a fit
Opportunity to declare his Pa&s;&s;ion to his admir'd
Mi&s;tre&s;s, which he having &s;oon met with one day,
as he was walking with her in the Garden, he by
the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate and tender Expre&s;&s;ions in the
World, endeavour'd to make her &s;en&s;ible of his
Love; which &s;he having received with a &s;eeming
Indifferency, he made his next Applications to the
Weywode her Father, unto whom he repre&s;ented
his De&s;ire of allying him&s;elf with his Family by
Marrying his Daughter, <HI>Marina,</HI> the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
whom he preferr'd before the Crown, even of <HI>Mu&s;|covy</HI>
it &s;elf. The Weywode, who had been before|hand
prepared by the Je&s;uits, being not in the lea&s;t
&s;urpri&s;ed at this Propo&s;ition; after he had thank'd
him for the Honour he intended to do his
Family, told him, that he thought he was a
little too ha&s;ty in applying his Thoughts to Mar|riage,
at a time when the Eyes of the whole World
were upon him, looking for the Succe&s;s of his En|terprize.
That a Mi&s;tre&s;s, at this Juncture of Time,
might prove a great Ob&s;tacle to his Affairs; that,
as he &s;tood in need of the powerful A&s;&s;i&s;tance of
&s;ome Princes, &s;o it was po&s;&s;ible one or other of
them might be for fortifying their Alliances with
him by a Marriage, which, if refu&s;ed, might
prove very prejudicial to his Affairs. He conclud|ed,
that as his Honour and Welfare were more dear
to him than his own Intere&s;t; &s;o he advi&s;ed him
to gain his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Heart by the Point of his
Sword, and by opening his Pa&s;&s;age to the Throne
of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;covy,</HI> through the Heart of him that U&s;urp'd
his Right. <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who by the Father's An|&s;wer,
<PB N="15" REF="140">
and the Indifferency of the Daughter, was
fully per&s;uaded, that the Succe&s;s of his Love, did
ab&s;olutely depend from his E&s;tabli&s;hment in the
Throne, apply'd him&s;elf with more than ordinary Vi|gour
to the accompli&s;hing of his De&s;ign. For which
Purpo&s;e, he was more conver&s;ant than ever with
the Je&s;uits, and having at la&s;t declared to them his
Re&s;olution of becoming a <HI>Roman Catholick,</HI> and
E&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;ame Religion in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> as &s;oon
as he &s;hould a&s;cend that Throne; the&s;e Fathers be|ing
over-joy'd at this Declaration, promi&s;ed him
their utmo&s;t Endeavours in procuring the A&s;&s;i&s;tance
both of the Holy Father, <HI>Clement</HI> VIII. and <HI>Sigi&s;|mund,</HI>
King of <HI>Poland.</HI> Being flu&s;h'd with the&s;e
hopes, he reiterated his pa&s;&s;ionate Addre&s;&s;es to his
Mi&s;tre&s;s and the Weywode, &s;o, that, at la&s;t he having
obtained their Con&s;ent, in ca&s;e he &s;hould recover
his Throne, the&s;e following Articles were agreed
on betwixt them: <HI>That in Con&s;ideration of the Sup|plies
and Aids to be given to</HI> Demetrius, <HI>he &s;hould be
obliged, after his, Acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, to re-pay the</HI>
Weywode <HI>his full Charges, Marry the Lady</HI> Mari|na,
<HI>his Daughter, and introduce the</HI> Roman Faith <HI>in</HI>
Mu&s;covy. The&s;e Articles being Sign'd and Rati|fied,
he was by the Weywode of <HI>Sendomiria</HI> and
<HI>Wi&s;nowiski,</HI> introduced to the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> who,
at the Recital of his Circum&s;tances, being mov'd
with Compa&s;&s;ion, did not only give him a very fa|vourable
Reception, but al&s;o granted him Permi&s;|&s;ion,
to levy what then he &s;tood in need of, for his
intended Expedition, in his Dominions. This Au|dience
turn'd to the no &s;mall Advantage of <HI>Deme|trius.</HI>
For, it having been very indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread
abroad, in what a favourable Manner he had been
received by King <HI>Sigi&s;mund,</HI> this did not only much
&s;trengthen his Party in <HI>Poland,</HI> where a great many
Per&s;ons of Quality e&s;pou&s;ed his Intere&s;t, but al&s;o
had &s;uch a powerful Influence upon the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI>
that they began to exclaim at the Treacheries of
<HI>Boris;</HI> and mo&s;t of them out of Fear, others out
of hope of Rewards, only &s;tay'd for a favourable
<PB N="16" REF="141">
Opportunity to declare for him, whom they now
began to look upon as their Natural Prince.</P>
<P><HI>Demetrius</HI> having &s;oon got notice, how the <HI>Mu&s;|covites</HI>
&s;tood affected, and brought over to his Par|ty
by great Pre&s;ents, &s;ome of the leading Men a|mong
them, thought it now high Time to put his
long projected De&s;ign in Execution. The Wey|wode
of <HI>Sendomiria</HI> had all this while been em|ployed
in rai&s;ing con&s;iderable Forces in <HI>Poland,</HI> for
this Expedition, and the Duke <HI>Wi&s;nowiski,</HI> having
al&s;o publickly declared for <HI>Demetrius,</HI> a con&s;idera|ble
Number of the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Nobility, on the Fron|tiers
of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> being encouraged by his Exam|ple,
e&s;pou&s;ed this Intere&s;t. Being &s;trengthened by

&s;uch a Terror into the Inhabitants of the neigh|bouring

advancing deeper into the Country, his Army was

the two Crowns for Twenty Years, was violated by
the</HI> Poles, <HI>who without the lea&s;t Rea&s;on given, had in|vaded
the Czar's Territories, taken his Towns, and
ravaged the Country: That he hoped the King would
take better Mea&s;ures, and not pur&s;ue a War that was
founded upon nothing but an unju&s;t Pretence, but recall
his Troops&punc; which were at that time employed to main|tain

made to mo&s;t of the Chief Mini&s;ters and other
great Men of the Court, he hoped to obtain what
all his Remon&s;trances had not been able to effect,
but in vain; for whether it were, that they look'd
upon <HI>Demetrius</HI> as the true Heir of the Crown, and
upon the Affairs of <HI>Boris</HI> as in a declining Condi|tion,
or that the Authority of the Pope and Je&s;uits
who had e&s;pou&s;ed the Intere&s;t of the fir&s;t, had
made them deaf to all the&s;e Applications, the Am|ba&s;&s;ador

<HI>That the King and Commonwealth of</HI> Poland <HI>were not

<PB N="18" REF="142">
<HI>this could not be interpreted a Violation of
the Truce betwixt the two Crowns, which on their &s;ide

his Aim in <HI>Poland,</HI> di&s;patched a Me&s;&s;enger to the

and to endeavour to undeceive the Wayvode of
<HI>Sendomiria,</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;nowiski,</HI> concerning the Fallacy
put upon them by the Counterfeit <HI>Demetrius.</HI> For
this End having found out one of his Uncles in

&s;eemed to threaten his Ruin; or that he thought

the Camp, and the Me&s;&s;enger &s;ent back with
Scorn and Indignation.</P>
<P><HI>Boris Goudenou,</HI> finding all other Means to fail, had
Recour&s;e to Arms, and ordered his Army, which

<P><HI>Demetrius</HI> therefore finding him&s;elf in a Po&s;t
from whence he could not retreat without fighting,
was forced to put the be&s;t Countenance he could
upon the Matter, and having nothing to tru&s;t to
but their own Courage, the <HI>Poles</HI> fought &s;o bravely,
that they not only repul&s;ed the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> who
being over confident in their Number attack'd
them with more Fury than Skill, but al&s;o charged
them at &s;everal times with &s;o much bravery, that

way, more to the Number than the Bravery of

<P>If the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> had been as careful in the Pur|&s;uit

<P>Being at la&s;t made &s;en&s;ible of their Mi&s;take, they

to their Allegiance to him, and e&s;pecially to entice
the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> from <HI>Demetrius</HI> to his Party, or whether
by &s;ome means or other, they could not di&s;patch and
&s;end him to the other World. But &s;ome of the&s;e
Emi&s;&s;aries being di&s;covered, and put to the Torture,
made an Ingenuous Confe&s;&s;ion of the Truth, and
were without any further Puni&s;hment, &s;ent back

he did not que&s;tion, but that before long, he &s;hould

if he would give him real Demon&s;trations of his
&s;incere Repentance, by &s;urrendring the Crown to
him who&s;e unque&s;tionable Right it was, he would
grant him, and all his Adherents a general Amne|&s;ty,

<P>But <HI>Boris</HI> having rejected the&s;e Offers with Scorn,
and yet &s;eeing his Adver&s;ary encrea&s;e in Strength
every day, he re&s;olved to try the utmo&s;t, and
whether by one dextrous Blow, he could not over|throw
him and his De&s;igns. He was not ignorant
that the main &s;trength of his Army con&s;i&s;ted in the
Auxiliaries and Supplies, he from time to time re|ceived
out of <HI>Poland,</HI> and that if he could by any
means, deprive him of his foreign Aids, the re&s;t
would &s;oon di&s;per&s;e, or at lea&s;t ea&s;ily be reduced
to obedience. He wi&s;ely con&s;idered, that, if a
con&s;iderable Diver&s;ion could be procured to the
<HI>Poles</HI> at home, they would be obliged to recall
their Subjects out of the Service of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who
deprived of their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, like a Body of its

<PB N="22" REF="144">
alone this intended Diver&s;ion, a Treaty was &s;et on

contrived a Letter, directed to the Governour and
Chief Officers of the Garri&s;on of <HI>Krom,</HI> wherein,
after having highly extolled their Valour and Zeal,
and made them ample Promi&s;es of Rewards, he

a certain Lightne&s;s, not bearing the lea&s;t pro|portion
to the Grandeur of his High Station; and
tho' they knew him to be endowed with a ready
Wit, and a &s;ufficient Stock of Courage, yet had
they ob&s;erved in all his Tran&s;actions, but a very
&s;lender &s;hare of Judgment, e&s;pecially in the Ma|nagement
of Publick Affairs relating to the Em|pire.
The Common People, who&s;e Judgment
&s;eldom reaches further than the out-&s;ide of things,
having ob&s;erved his Habit, Manners and Ge&s;tures, to
be wholly Foreign, concluded his Inclinations to be
the &s;ame. For he frequently u&s;ed to appear in
<HI>Poli&s;h</HI> and other Foreign Habits, he &s;eldom bathed,
and &s;carce ever &s;lept after Dinner, according to
the general Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> he would
carry his Dogs along with him into the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI>
Churches, he would eat Calves Fle&s;h, and not
bow to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> all which being abominable
to the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> a People &s;uper&s;titious to a degree
of Madne&s;s, contributed not a little to the Hatred
which the Populacy conceived again&s;t his Per&s;on.
But what mo&s;t enflamed both the Nobility and
People was, that they &s;aw their immen&s;e Trea&s;ures
wa&s;ted in a few Months, among his Players, Para|&s;ites,

a very a&s;piring Temper, did without que&s;tion aim

<HI>Demetrius,</HI> as if hurried on by &s;ome fatal Stupidi|ty

his Pardon, but &s;oon after received him into his

among them, that at the clo&s;ing of the
Fea&s;t, when the whole Court &s;hould be buried in
&s;trong Liquor, and Sleep, &s;hould be the beginning
of the Tragedy they intended to act the next
Morning. The very &s;ame Night there happned a
certain Accident, which had been likely to have
once more &s;poil'd their whole De&s;ign.</P>
<P>For a certain young Fellow who was privy to the
Con&s;piracy, drinking with &s;ome of the Guards,
and being elevated by the Force of the &s;trong Li|quor,
had unwarily let fall &s;ome Words in his Di&s;|cour&s;e
concerning this intended Con&s;piracy&punc; where|upon,
being &s;eized and brought before <HI>Demetrius,</HI>
he order'd him immediately to be put to the Rack,
to extort from him the whole truth of the De&s;ign.

in the Plot, and in the mo&s;t imminent Dan|ger&punc;
that could be of being di&s;covered, told the
Grand Duke, that it was ea&s;ily to be &s;een, that the
young Fellow's Brains were intoxicated by the
Strength of the <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> and that therefore it
would be a Madne&s;s to make the lea&s;t Reflection
upon what he &s;aid while he was drunk. <HI>Demetrius,</HI>
hurried on by his malignant Fate to his approaching
De&s;tiny, being al&s;o hot-headed with the great quan|tity
of Wine he had drank that Day, followed the
deceitful Advice of his mortal Enemies, and di&s;|mi&s;s'd
the young Fellow for time, with an Inten|tion
to have him further examined the next day,

horrible Out-cries to be made in the Market-place
and adjacent Streets, that the <HI>Poles,</HI> who were
lately come along with the Grand Dutche&s;s, were in
Arms, with an Intention to Ma&s;&s;acre all the Inha|bitants
of the City. The Citizens being &s;oon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
waked by tho&s;e dreadful Apprehen&s;ions, with the
A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Con&s;pirators, who had di&s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ed

<P>The Beginning of their projected De&s;ign having
thus &s;ucceeded according to Wi&s;h, <HI>Knez Ba&s;ili-Zuski</HI>

&s;ecured them&s;elves again&s;t all Oppo&s;ition, marched
directly with their Scymeters in their Hands towards
the Ca&s;tle, where they found every thing in a profound
Silence and Security, every Soul there being over|whelmed
with Sleep, Wearine&s;s and &s;trong Liquor,
to that Degree, that the Con&s;pirators were advan|ced

Pi&s;tols and Muskets, they di&s;charged &s;o furiou&s;ly

of them being &s;lain, (among whom was <HI>Bo&s;man,</HI>
who was &s;tabb'd with a Dagger,) <HI>Demetrius</HI> was
forced to retire, and being pur&s;ued from Chamber
to Chamber, at la&s;t threw him&s;elf out of the
Window, down into one of the Courts,
from whence, tho' &s;orely brui&s;ed, he at la&s;t got
into the Fortre&s;s of the Ca&s;tle guarded by <HI>Mu&s;|covites.</HI></P>
<P>The Con&s;pirators being enraged at their having
mi&s;s'd their Prey, fell a ran&s;acking the Great
Dukes Apartment, and forcing their Way with
their Scymeters thro' the Bodies of a few Attend|ants
that were left, entred the Grand Duke's Bed-Chamber,
whither all the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Ladies of Quality
were retired, and at the Approach of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI>
appeared half dead and immovable, like Statues, for
fear, not being able to utter one Word, unle&s;s it
were a certain ancient Lady, who &s;omewhat more
confident than the re&s;t, by rea&s;on of her great Age,
an&s;wered the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Lords that were enquiring
where the Great Dutche&s;s was? <HI>That at the begin|ning
of the Tumult &s;he had found means, to get away
as &s;he believed, to her Father's Palace.</HI> Having
&s;earch'd all over the Room, and not being able
to find her, they were re&s;olved to try whether they
could put Life into the Ladies, and re&s;tore to them
that Natural Motion they had lo&s;t by this &s;udden Con|&s;ternation,
and &s;o to work they went, every one
catching hold of her he liked be&s;t; and thus having
&s;atisfied their bruti&s;h Lu&s;t, they were going to leave
the Room, in further Pur&s;uit after <HI>Demetrius.</HI> It is to
be ob&s;erved that among all the Ladies that were
<PB N="41" REF="156">
there, but two e&s;caped their Violences; the fir&s;t
was the Lady Palatine of <HI>Lamoc,</HI> we mentiond be|fore,
&s;ecured more by her Wrinkles and Grey Hair
than out of any Re&s;pect to her Per&s;on; and ano|ther
Lady that &s;ate very &s;ick in a large Elbow-Chair,
One of the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Lords, as they were Ju&s;t go|ing
out, hapning to ca&s;t his Eyes that way, ob&s;erv|ed
&s;ome Motion behind that Chair, and being cu|rious
to know the Meaning of it, advanced that
Way, where having pulled up the Hangings he di&s;|covered
the poor affrighted <HI>Marina,</HI> who as &s;he
was of an extraordinary Pre&s;ence of Mind, look'd
upon them with &s;o Maje&s;tick an Air, that they
all withdrew without offering any further Vio|lence.</P>
<P>By this time&punc; the Con&s;pirators being adverti&s;ed
that <HI>Demetrius</HI> had &s;aved him&s;elf among the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites</HI>
that guarded the Fortre&s;s of the Ca&s;tle, they
march'd thither and attack'd the Fort with the ut|mo&s;t
Fury; but the&s;e within being encouraged by
the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who notwith&s;tanding
the Violent Brui&s;es occa&s;ioned by his leaping out of
the Widow, fought in this Extremity like a Lion,
with a Re&s;olution rather to die with his Scymeter
in his Hand than to be expo&s;ed to the Scorn of his
Enemies, they were repul&s;ed with great Slaughter;
but their Strength increa&s;ing with their Number,
they renew'd the A&s;&s;ault &s;everal times, but were as
often repul&s;ed, till the Garri&s;on by their Threats
was at la&s;t prevailed upon to &s;urrender the unfor|tunate
<HI>Demetrius</HI> into their Hands.</P>
<P>From thence they led him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Deme|trius</HI> led in Triumph.</NOTE> after they had put a
ragged Coat about him, thro' the Streets of the
City in Triumph, under the Imprecations and
Scorns of the Rabble, who pointed Fingers
into his very Eyes, pluck'd him by the No&s;e
and Chin, asking him whether he was now <HI>De|metrius</HI>
or <HI>Grisko?</HI> All which he bore with a mo&s;t
admirable Con&s;tancy, not &s;o much as uttering one
Word, and &s;carce changing his Countenance. But
coming near the Market-place, and perceiving a
<PB N="42" REF="157">
great number of the dead Bodies of the <HI>Poles</HI> &s;lain

a greater Sen&s;e of their Sufferings than his

&s;pared his Friends, he &s;hould not have grumbled
at his own Fate, tho' perhaps the mo&s;t &s;evere, and
not to be parallel'd in Hi&s;tory, as being their lawful

and partly to revenge her &s;elf upon the Family of

<P>This An&s;wer having been &s;oon &s;pread among the

dragg'd it thro' the Streets of the City, and com|mitted
all manner of Barbarities upon the dead
Body of the &s;ame Per&s;on, whom within a few

<P>Thus was the Splendor of the Nuptials darkned

<P>It is a controverted Point to this day, not only
among a great many of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians,</HI> but e&s;pecially
betwixt the <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Swedes,</HI> whether he was an

put beyond all que&s;tion by the Evidence of the
Empre&s;s Dowager, and <HI>Ba&s;ili-Zuski</HI> him&s;elf, who
managed the Funeral Solemnities of the true <HI>Deme|trius,</HI>
&s;lain at <HI>&V;gletz,</HI> and a&s;&s;erted that he was certainly
murthered by the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins &s;ent for that purpo&s;e by
<HI>Boris Goudenou;</HI> and that the owning of this Im|po&s;tor
to be the true <HI>Demetrius</HI> by <HI>Zuski,</HI> proceeded
from his fear of being Ma&s;&s;acred by the People, as
that of the Empre&s;s owes its Origin to the Obliga|tion
&s;he had to him for her Liberty and the Satisfa|ction
&s;he received of being revenged of the <HI>Bori|&s;ian</HI>
Family. The <HI>Poles,</HI> on the other hand, who
&s;ided with this <HI>Demetrius,</HI> a&s;&s;ert the contrary,
affirming, that what the <HI>Swedes</HI> relate of him, is

that the Weywode of <HI>Sendomiria,</HI> would have thus
engag'd in his Intere&s;t, and promi&s;ed him his
Daughter in Marriage, if, be&s;ides the great Re&s;em|blance
he had with that <HI>Demetrius</HI> at <HI>&V;gletz,</HI> he
<PB N="44" REF="158">
had not had very evident Proofs of the reality of
his Extraction. That the fir&s;t Declaration of the
Empre&s;s <HI>Dowager,</HI> was without que&s;tion real, and
that the pretended denial made afterwards to <HI>Ba|&s;ili-Zuski,</HI>
concerning this <HI>Demetrius,</HI> was extorted
from her by Fear; be&s;ides that, it was only found|ed
upon the Faith of <HI>Ba&s;ili-Zuski,</HI> who, as it &s;uffi|ciently
appear'd afterwards; was his Rival for the
Crown of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and &s;ucceeded him in the Em|pire.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t pur&s;ue our Tragedy, which did not
end with the Death of <HI>Demetrius;</HI> For, there be|ing
a con&s;iderable number of <HI>Poles</HI> quartered in the
more remote Parts of the City, who being involv|ed
in Drink and Sleep, had not as yet heard the
lea&s;t Tidings of what had pa&s;t in and about the
Ca&s;tle; and the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> fearing, not without
Rea&s;on, that if they &s;hould take the Alarm upon &s;o
&s;urpri&s;ing an Occa&s;ion, they would &s;ell their Lives
at a very dear rate, they re&s;olved to draw them into
the Trap, before they could have any notice of
this Accident. For this purpo&s;e, certain Me&s;&s;en|gers
were di&s;patch'd with counterfeit Orders from
<HI>Demetrius,</HI> to appear forthwith in the Ca&s;tle with|out
their Arms, the Grand Duke being re&s;olved,
that at the Day of a general Rejoycing, nothing
of Terror &s;hould appear at his Nuptials. The <HI>Poles,</HI>
not &s;u&s;pecting the concealed Fraud of this deceit|ful
Me&s;&s;age, came forth without their Arms, thus
tamely expo&s;ing them&s;elves to the Slaughter,
which was executed upon them with a more
than barbarous Cruelty, very few e&s;caping the hands
of the bloody <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> except &s;ome Gentlemen
of Quality, who having &s;catter'd &s;ome Money a|mong
the Rabble, had thereby an Opportunity
given them to gather into a &s;mall Body, and &s;o
hew'd their Way thro' their Enemies, till they came
to the Palace of <HI>George Mni&s;zeck,</HI> Weywode of
<HI>Sendomiria,</HI> Father-in-Law to the Great Dutche&s;s,
where was al&s;o the Duke <HI>Wi&s;nowiski,</HI> and &s;ome o|ther
<HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Lords, who having opened their way
<PB N="45" REF="158">
by their Scymiters to this Palace, which was pretty
&s;trong, were re&s;olved to defend it to the utmo&s;t,
and at lea&s;t not to &s;ell their Lives at a cheap rate.
Neither was it long before they &s;aw them&s;elves &s;ur|rounded
on all &s;ides by an infinite number of their
Enemies, who with great Fury attack'd them on
all &s;ides, but with little Succe&s;s, for, the <HI>Poles</HI>
having no other Sanctuary left them, fought like
de&s;perate Men, and as often as they were attack'd
by the Enemies, drove them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> back with a great
Slaughter, &s;o that at la&s;t their Fury being quell'd
by the difficulty of the Enterprize, and the Blood
of their Comerades, they thought fit to leave the
<HI>Poles,</HI> who thus &s;aved them&s;elves by their own
Bravery, by giving &s;uch Te&s;timonies of their
Courage to the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> as made them &s;ufficient|ly,
&s;en&s;ible that if the re&s;t of the <HI>Poles</HI> had been alive,
they would not have rid them&s;elves at &s;o cheap a
rate of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and that they were more be|holding
to the Conduct of <HI>Zuski,</HI> than their own
Courage for the Succe&s;s of this Con&s;piracy. To
revenge them&s;elves of the Affront received at the be|forementioned
Palace, they fell upon the Jewellers,
and other foreign Merchants that were lodged up
and down the City, of whom they kill'd the great|e&s;t
part, &s;ome few e&s;caping into the Hou&s;es of the
Amba&s;&s;adors of the &s;everal Nations, to whom they
belonged, where, by the Interce&s;&s;ion of the Lead|ing
Men of the Con&s;piracy, they found a Sanctu|ary
again&s;t the mo&s;t barbarous Fury of the enrag'd
Multitude.</P>

<P>THE next following night, having put an end
to the Ma&s;&s;acre and Tumult, the Boyars and
other Lords of the Empire met two days after, to
concert mea&s;ures about the Election of a new Em|perour.
The deference they all paid to <HI>Zuski,</HI> as
the Contriver and Chief Leader of the whole En|terprize,
made them, after he had received the
Thanks of the whole A&s;&s;embly, fir&s;t addre&s;s them|&s;elves
to him, and de&s;ire his Opinion in the pre|&s;ent
Emergency of the State.</P>
<P><HI>Ba&s;ili-Zuski,</HI> who beforehand had &s;ufficient
Opportunity to &s;ound their Inclinations, know|ing
that the major Part were at his Devotion, and
not que&s;tioning but that&punc; the re&s;t, in acknowledg|ment
of his late Service, would al&s;o, without much
difficulty, be brought over to his Party, took this
Opportunity to tell them; That he was over-joy|ed
to &s;ee the &s;ame Satisfaction in their Faces, which
they had te&s;tified by their Words, in reference to
the late Enterprize, contrived and executed by his
directions; That, as the Greatne&s;s of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI>
Empire was chiefly owing to the extraordinary
Feats of that renowned Emperour, <HI>John Ba&s;ilovits,</HI>
&s;o the pre&s;ent ill po&s;ture of their Affairs mu&s;t be
attributed to the Perfidiou&s;ne&s;s, Murders, and U|&s;urpation
of <HI>Boris Goudenou:</HI> That, to deliver
them from this U&s;urper, and to revenge upon him
<PB N="47" REF="159">
the Death of the two Sons of <HI>John Ba&s;ilovits,</HI> he
had been prevail'd upon to acknowledge the la&s;t
Great Duke for the true <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and rightful
Heir of the Crown. But this Impo&s;tor, having
trampled both upon their Laws and Religion, he
had twice ventur'd his Life to re&s;cue them from
his un&s;upportable Tyranny; and &s;ince now God
Almighty had ble&s;s'd their projected De&s;ign with
Succe&s;s, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Zeal and Courage
for the common Cau&s;e, whereby the Royal Line
being&punc; extingui&s;hed, they were now in the qua|ity
of a Free People, unto whom was devolved
the whole Right of Election, it was their Duty
not to let &s;lip &s;o favourable an opportunity of re|e&s;tabli&s;hing
their Affairs, according to the true an|tient
Con&s;titution of that Great Monarchy, which
they ought to look upon as the only &s;olid Founda|tion,
whereupon to build &s;o va&s;t a Structure. That,
as for his part, he was very ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t them
with his Coun&s;el, and &s;uch Ob&s;ervations as he had
opportunity to make during the &s;pace of thirty or
forty Years, in the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Employments
in the Kingdom; being &s;en&s;ible that their future Fe|licity
would depend from the Choice they were
now going to make of a Per&s;on fit to fill the Throne
of this va&s;t Empire. That (if they would follow his
Advice) a Per&s;on of mean Extraction would by no
means be qualified to an&s;wer their Expectation,
and to command &s;o many Per&s;ons of an eminent
Rank, who would not without Reluctancy &s;ub|mit
to his Commands, or at lea&s;t claim a Preroga|tive
to controul his Orders, and to have a &s;hare in
the Admini&s;tration of the Government. That a
young Prince would be in&s;ufficient to undergo
the Burthen, at the pre&s;ent juncture of Time, that
it was to be fear'd he would be more mindful of
his Plea&s;ures, than the Troubles and Fatigues of &s;o
great a Charge, and by neglecting his Duty, and
laying the Weight thereof upon other Men's Should|ers,
make their pre&s;ent Condition wor&s;er, in&s;tead of
mending it. That therefore they had no other way
<PB N="48" REF="160">
left them at this time, than to ca&s;t their Eyes upon
a Per&s;on in the Commonwealth, fitly qualified for
the Management of &s;o great an Empire, at the wor&s;t
of Times. That, to an&s;wer this End, they ough to
chu&s;e One advanced in Years, of an Illu&s;trious Birth,
and well vers'd, by many Years Experience in
the Management of publick Affairs; one of approved
Valour and Conduct, mea&s;uring his Intere&s;t by that
of the State, and con&s;tantly adhering to their Reli|gion
and mo&s;t ancient Cu&s;toms; From &s;uch a one
it is (concluded he) that we may with Rea&s;on ex|pect
a Redre&s;s of tho&s;e Mi&s;chiefs which have in the
late Reigns overwhelmed this Empire, and &s;ee it
re&s;tored to its former flouri&s;hing Condition.</P>
<P>There were very few in the A&s;&s;embly, who did
not perceive that <HI>Ba&s;ili-Zuski,</HI> in the De&s;cription
he had given of his Prince to fill the Throne of
<HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> had pointed directly at him&s;elf; They
knew him to be de&s;cended of one of the mo&s;t illu|&s;trious
Families in the whole Empire, and by his
long and many Services, both in Peace and War,
trained up in the Management of the State, &s;o that
meeting, in his Per&s;on, with all the nece&s;&s;ary Quali|fications
for &s;o great a Tru&s;t, after &s;ome days De|bate,
by the Suffrages of the Nobility, he was elected
and proclaimed Emperour of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> in the Month
of <HI>June,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ba&s;ili Zus|ki</HI> made Emperour.</NOTE> in the Year 1606, about a Month after
the Ma&s;&s;acre of <HI>Demetrius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ba&s;ili-Zuski,</HI> being thus placed in the Throne,
was &s;oon after Crowned with the u&s;ual Solemnities:
The fir&s;t thing he did, was to &s;end <HI>Marina,</HI> with all
her Moveables &s;he brought along with her out of
<HI>Poland</HI> (except the Crown Jewels) to her Father's
Palace, where he placed a &s;trong Guard, under
pretence of pre&s;erving them from the Outrages of
the Common People, but in effect to ob&s;erve their
Motions, and to &s;ecure them as his Pri&s;oners, till he
&s;aw how the Treatment the <HI>Poles</HI> had met with
in <HI>Mu&s;co</HI> would be reli&s;h'd at the Court of <HI>Sigi&s;|mund.</HI>
And the better to palliate the late Ma&s;&s;acre,
he publi&s;hed his Declaration, &s;tiling <HI>Demetrius</HI> an
<PB N="49" REF="160">
Impo&s;tor, Heretick, and Tyrant, and that the mo&s;t
imminent Danger, unto which both Church and
State were reduced, under his &s;hort but unfortunate
Reign, had forced him again&s;t his Inclinations to
embark in a De&s;ign to deliver his Native Country
from Death and Confu&s;ion, which, tho' &s;omewhat
cruel in the Execution, yet by its ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;i|ty,
Ju&s;tice of the Cau&s;e, and happy Event, was
&s;ufficiently ju&s;tifiable to all the World.</P>
<P>This Sugar-plumb, tho' it was greedily &s;wallow|ed
by the giddy-headed Multitude, who being al|ways
in Extreams, and fond of Novelties, &s;hewed
their Approbation by digging up the dead Carca&s;s of
<HI>Demetrius,</HI> which with mo&s;t horrible Imprecations,
(in which the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> excell mo&s;t other Nations)
they burnt and threw the A&s;hes into the Air, yet did
it not reli&s;h &s;o well with the <HI>Poles,</HI> but that, not|wit&s;tanding
all his &s;pecious Pretences, they re&s;ol|ved
to call him to a &s;evere Account for the Barba|rities
committed upon their Country-men.</P>
<P>Neither was it long before they met with an
Opportunity to revenge them&s;elves, and to give
very &s;en&s;ible Proofs of their utmo&s;t Re&s;entments
again&s;t <HI>Zuski,</HI> the Contriver and chief Actor of that
Tragedy. For, tho' the dead Body of the late <HI>Demetrius</HI>
was expo&s;ed to publick View for &s;everal days, it
was &s;o mangl'd and hack'd by the Fury of the Mul|titude,
that it was impo&s;&s;ible to be known even by
the neare&s;t of his Friends. Which <HI>Schacopski,</HI> the
Lord Chancellor of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and one of his mo&s;t
tru&s;ty Friends having got notice of, he made his
E&s;cape with two or three more whom he knew to
be ab&s;olutely in his Intere&s;t, to the City of <HI>Putti|woll,</HI>
which had always &s;tood vigorous for <HI>Deme|trius,</HI>
from the fir&s;t time he entred <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> with
an Army. As they were travelling upon the Road
at &s;ome di&s;tance from the City of <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> they
made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;pread it about the Coun|try,
that <HI>Demetrius</HI> was not dead, that the People
during the Tumult had apprehended and ma&s;&s;acred
another in his place, he having at the very begin|ning
<PB N="50" REF="161">
of the Di&s;order &s;aved him&s;elf by Flight.
They &s;hewed to &s;everal Inn-keepers, the Great Seal
of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> telling them at their Departure, that
in a little time they &s;hould know what a great
Gue&s;t they had entertain'd that Night. They were
al&s;o very profu&s;e of their Gold, all which &s;erving for
a Confirmation of what they had heard them &s;ay be|fore,
they took it as an undoubted Truth; and the
more they were enjoin'd Secre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ie, the more eager
were they in Whi&s;pering it about among their
Friends, &s;o that in a little time it became currant
News in the City of <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> where it having been
encouraged and improved by &s;ome &s;ecret Friends of
<HI>Demetrius,</HI> there was &s;carce a Meeting where this
&s;urprizing News was not the chief Subject of their
Di&s;cour&s;e, every one judging of the Matter accor|ding
to his own Sentiment.</P>
<P>In the mean while, <HI>George Schacopski</HI> was, with
his Friends, arriv'd at <HI>Puttiwoll,</HI> from whence ha|ving
immediately di&s;patch'd a Me&s;&s;enger into <HI>Po|land,</HI>
with Letters to the Weywode of <HI>Sendomiria</HI>'s
Lady, wherein he gave her a full Relation of the
Con&s;piracy form'd by <HI>Zuski</HI> and his Party again&s;t
her Son-in-Law, but that by a peculiar Providence he
had &s;aved him&s;elf in time by Flight, and was retir'd
to a Place of Security, from whence he would &s;ud|denly
return at the Head of a con&s;iderable Army
to revenge the Death of his Friends upon the&s;e
Traitors. That her Husband al&s;o had by his Va|lour
e&s;caped the Fury of the enraged Multitude,
and remained in good Health in the City of <HI>Mu&s;|co;</HI>
and that in a little time he hoped to give her
a more ample Account of the further Succe&s;s of
their Affairs.</P>
<P>Having &s;ent away the Me&s;&s;enger with the&s;e Di|&s;patches,
he immediately demanded Audience, in
the Great Duke, <HI>Demetrius,</HI> his Ma&s;ter's Name,
which being &s;oon granted, he appear'd in the A&s;|&s;embly
the next day, where having highly extoll'd
the Zeal of the Citizens of <HI>Puttiwoll,</HI> in having
been the fir&s;t that e&s;pou&s;ed the Intere&s;t of <HI>Deme|trius,</HI>

in the very Infancy of his Affairs, and their
Con&s;tancy in per&s;evering ever &s;ince &s;tedfa&s;t in

how <HI>Zuski,</HI> the pre&s;ent U&s;urper, prompted by his
immen&s;urable Ambition of putting the Crown up|on
his own Head, had with his party form'd a
Con&s;piracy again&s;t the Life of the Grand Duke
<HI>Demetrius;</HI> that, to facilitate their Helli&s;h De&s;ign,
they had ma&s;&s;acred a great number of innocent
Per&s;ons in their Beds, again&s;t all the Laws of
Ho&s;pitality, and afterwards intended to have done
the &s;ame to the Great Duke him&s;elf, whom they
intended to have &s;urprized in his Palace; but ha|ving
been &s;topt for a little while by the Re&s;i&s;tance
made by his tru&s;ty Servants, he had by a peculiar
Providence of God Almighty, got into his Stables,
where being furni&s;hed with &s;ome of his &s;wifte&s;t
Hor&s;es, he was with a few of his particular Friends
e&s;cap'd the Fury of the People, and had directed his
Cour&s;e to <HI>Poland,</HI> from whence he &s;oon hoped
to return with &s;o con&s;iderable a Force as to be
able to reduce his rebellious Subjects to Obedience.
He told them that he had recommended to his Care
the Affairs of the whole Empire in his Ab&s;ence;
for the Confirmation of which, he produced the
Great Seal of <HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> and that he had given him
a mo&s;t particular Charge to &s;atisfie his faithful Citi|zens

&s;uch con&s;tant and evident Proofs of their Loyalty,
he had, in Obedience to his Ma&s;ter's Commands,
taken the direct Road to this City, to di&s;charge
him&s;elf of his Commi&s;&s;ion, and to give them fre&s;h
A&s;&s;urances of the Grand Duke's Favour which they
had at this time the be&s;t Opportunity in the World

<P>This <HI>Polutnich</HI> was a <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> by Birth, and now

from thence he took his way through <HI>Poland,</HI> where

join'd the Forces before <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> &s;hew'd his
Orders to <HI>I&s;thoma,</HI> who was forced to obey, but
being extreamly di&s;gu&s;ted at the Affront put upon
him, to &s;ee him&s;elf thus neglected, and another

thou&s;and Men, whom he had debauch'd before, and
brought over to his Party, went over to <HI>Zuski,</HI>
who receiv'd him no le&s;s than his Tutelar Angel,
to whom he was indebted for his pre&s;ent Deliver|ance;
e&s;pecially when he a&s;&s;ured both him and the
People, that there was no &s;uch Man as <HI>Demetrius</HI>
at <HI>Puttiwoll;</HI> and that the whole was only a Con|trivance
of <HI>Schacopski,</HI> who by the&s;e Intrigues in|tended
to make him&s;elf the more Con&s;iderable.</P>

admitted into the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Demetrius</HI> their
Prince, and that they were ready to pro&s;trate them|&s;elves
at his Feet, and to beg pardon for their pa&s;t
Offences. Tho&s;e of the Nobility repre&s;ented to
the General, how mi&s;erably he was impo&s;ed upon
by the Artifices of <HI>Schacopski;</HI> that the true <HI>Deme|trius,</HI>
who&s;e Intere&s;t he had e&s;pou&s;ed was in the
pre&s;ence of a great many Thou&s;ands &s;lain in the
City of <HI>Mu&s;co;</HI> and therefore, whoever &s;ince had
a&s;&s;umed his Name, and counterfeited his Per|&s;on,
mu&s;t needs be an Impo&s;tor, from whom
he could expect neither Honour nor Profit; That
therefore, he would be much better advi&s;ed to
leave his Party, and to &s;pare the Effu&s;ion of
Chri&s;tian Blood, by acknowledging <HI>Zuski</HI> for the
lawful Sovereign of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> who would not fail

was &s;orry to under&s;tand that they took him to be
like <HI>I&s;thoma,</HI> a Traytor both to his Ma&s;ter and
Country; That they did him wrong in entertain|ing
<PB N="55" REF="163">
&s;o mean an Opinion of him; That, tho' he
was a Soldier of Fortune, he would never give
<HI>Demetrius</HI> the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion of repenting him&s;elf
of the Tru&s;t he had put in him. That the Prince
was certainly in <HI>Poland,</HI> where he had &s;een and
&s;poke with him, and had from his own hands re|ceived
this Commi&s;&s;ion of being General of this
Army. That if they were &s;o nearly touch'd, as
they pretended, in their Con&s;ciences, with the Ef|fu&s;ion
of Humane Blood, the be&s;t way to prevent
it would be, to return to their true Allegiance, and
pay to their lawful Prince due Obedience, and as
a Pledge of their future Fidelity, and of their re|mor&s;e
for what was pa&s;t, to deliver up into his
Hands the U&s;urper of his Crown. That this was
the only means left them to prevent the&s;e Evils,
which they dreaded, and by which they might
hope to de&s;erve their Pardon, and to &s;ecure them|&s;elves,
their Wives and Children, and the whole

That therefore they &s;hould not be &s;tartled at

was back'd by &s;ome of the Chiefe&s;t Men of the King|dom,
and in great E&s;teem with the King him&s;elf,
&s;o it was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that they &s;hould be
able to prevail again&s;t their Power, when ab&s;ent,
which perhaps, when pre&s;ent, they might do with|out
much Difficulty, by repre&s;enting to the Court
the true State of the Ca&s;e, and the Impo&s;ture of
<HI>Demetrius.</HI> They repre&s;ented to them, how advan|tageous
it would be to their Affairs, in detecting
the whole Intrigue of this &s;uppo&s;ititious <HI>Demetrius,</HI>
if <HI>Marina</HI> in Per&s;on appear'd at Court, and by her
own Confe&s;&s;ion confirmed the Death of her Lord,
which would put the Impo&s;ture of this Pretender

<P>The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> did not very well reli&s;h the&s;e

as well as to <HI>Marina,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Marina</HI> and her Father &s;et at liberty.</NOTE> they granted their Liberty,
under Condition, that they &s;hould undertake to
oblige the King of <HI>Poland</HI> to draw back the Army
of his Subjects, which lay encamped under the
Walls of the City of <HI>Mu&s;co.</HI> They were not &s;pa|ring

King of <HI>Poland.</HI> They were not a little divided in
their Opinions. Some of them repre&s;ented to <HI>Ma|rina,</HI>
how ignominious it would be for a Per&s;on
of her Extraction and Dignity, to throw her&s;elf
away upon an unknown Vagabond, whom &s;he
her&s;elf knew to be an Impo&s;tor, and &s;et up by the
<HI>Poles,</HI> for no other End, than to &s;erve their own
Turn of revenging them&s;elves upon <HI>Zuski</HI> and the
<HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> which when they had effected, and

&s;ure to ca&s;t off, and throw him upon the Dunghill,

That the <HI>Zuskians</HI> would not fail to improve the

her, that &s;he had married a mean Wretch, and a
&s;uborued Property, in hopes to &s;atisfie her own
Ambition, and to gratify the Ends of a third Party.
On the other hand, it was urged, that there being
no great likelihood that the <HI>Poles</HI> &s;hould abandon
his Intere&s;t, more than they had done that of the
former, as being founded upon the &s;ame bottom,
and link'd together by a mutual Intere&s;t, the mo&s;t

both, equally doubtful, as to their De&s;cent, in re|lation
to the Great Duke, <HI>John Ba&s;ilovits;</HI> and,
that, &s;ince &s;he had once had the Misfortune of

&s;he might, with the &s;ame Rea&s;on, not refu&s;e the

own Country, they had recour&s;e to the &s;ame Po|licy,
which <HI>Boris Goudenou</HI> intended to have made
u&s;e of again&s;t the <HI>Poles,</HI> if he had not been pre|vented
by his &s;udden Death. They were &s;uffici|ently
&s;en&s;ible, that <HI>Charles,</HI> then King of <HI>Sweden,</HI>
who had found Means to exclude his Nephew <HI>Sigi&s;|mund,</HI>
then King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and lawful Heir to the
Crown of <HI>Sweden,</HI> from that Crown, would be glad
of any Opportunity to &s;top the Progre&s;s of the <HI>Poles,</HI>
to prevent their becoming Ma&s;ters of the Empire of
<HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> which would infallibly open them the
way into the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Territories. They apply'd
them&s;elves therefore to the beforementioned King
<HI>Charles,</HI> who, upon their Reque&s;t, &s;ent them con|&s;iderable
Supplies, and fir&s;t check'd the cour&s;e of the
Victories of the <HI>Poles,</HI> which gave &s;uch Encourage|ment
to many other Provinces of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> that being
tir'd with the In&s;olencies and Exactions of the <HI>Deme|trians,</HI>
they &s;hook off the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Yoke, and the&s;e be|ing

<PB N="81" REF="180">
of <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> which
at la&s;t proved fatal, both to <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and the
<HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Affairs in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> which was thus unex|pectedly
delivered from its Enemies; when in all
Humane Appearance, they were ready to triumph
over them; as it will &s;ufficiently appear out of the
Sequel of this Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>For, when the <HI>Poles</HI> &s;aw the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> reduced
to the greate&s;t &s;traights that could be, by the&s;e in|te&s;tine
Di&s;&s;en&s;ions, rai&s;ed and fomented by their
Contrivance, they judged now to have met with a
favourable Opportunity to make them&s;elves Ma|&s;ters
of that va&s;t Empire. For which rea&s;on, the
Senate of the Kingdom of <HI>Poland,</HI> repre&s;ented to
their King <HI>Sigi&s;mund,</HI> how ea&s;ie it would be for
him, at this critical Juncture, to gives Laws to
both Parties in that divided Empire, if he would
&s;hew him&s;elf at the Head of a con&s;iderable Army,
which was ready at hand in <HI>Poland,</HI> to march upon
his fir&s;t Orders, into <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> where they might live
upon the Country, whereas they mu&s;t now be
maintain'd at the Charge of the Republick. Be|&s;ides
the benefit he would reap from this Expediti|on,
in giving Laws to the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> and purging
the Kingdom of <HI>Poland</HI> of a great number of Va|gabonds
and idle Per&s;ons, the remnants of their
late civil Di&s;&s;en&s;ions, it would be a glorious Work,
to revenge the barbarous Murder of &s;o many of
his Subjects, and the detaining of his Amba&s;&s;adors.
The Chief thing objected was; that the Truce made
&s;ome Years ago betwixt both Nations was not
expir'd; But this Objection was &s;oon an&s;wered,
con&s;idering that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> had been the fir&s;t,
who violated it in Ma&s;&s;acring the <HI>Poles</HI> again&s;t all
Laws of Ho&s;pitality, and detaining their Amba&s;&s;a|dors,
again&s;t the Law of Nations; but, &s;uppo&s;ing
this to be in&s;ufficient, the &s;pecious Pretence <HI>Sigi&s;|mund</HI>

their lawful Great Duke in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the

<P>King <HI>Sigi&s;mund,</HI> being &s;wayed by the&s;e impor|tant

the City of <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> and in conjunction with the
<HI>Demetrian</HI> Army, attack'd that City, or at lea&s;t
block'd it up more clo&s;ely than before; the Inha|bitants
who were already reduced to great Straits
for want of all manner of Nece&s;&s;aries, would &s;oon
have been forced to abandon <HI>Zuski,</HI> and to embrace
his Party; which done&punc; it would have been no diffi|cult
Matter to &s;uppre&s;s <HI>Demetrius,</HI> by drawing from
his &s;ide the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI> and <HI>Poles</HI> (the main, if not the on|ly
Strength of his Army) by great Rewards; and
thus, either to render him&s;elf ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter of
the whole Empire, or at lea&s;t, by coming to a com|po&s;ition
with <HI>Demetrius,</HI> to unite all the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI>
Provinces, bordering on <HI>Lithuania</HI> and <HI>Poland</HI> with
his Crown. But in&s;tead of following the&s;e whole|&s;ome
Coun&s;els, he took quite contrary mea&s;ures,
which rendred his whole De&s;ign abortive, and lo&s;t
his Son <HI>&V;ladi&s;laus</HI> the Crown of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> as he
him&s;elf, by his own mi&s;management had lo&s;t that

if he would march to <HI>Smolensko,</HI> the Capital of the
Province of the &s;ame name, it would be &s;urren|dred
into his hands at his fir&s;t appearing before it.
This City, which is &s;eated on the Banks of the <HI>Bo|ry&s;thenes,</HI>
and &s;urrounded with a very good Wall of
Stone and Brick, was in tho&s;e days much larger
than it is now, it having been much altered from
its former Beauty and Wealth by the various Chan|ces
<PB N="83" REF="181">
of War; and tho' it had no out-works or Ditch,
yet this Defect was &s;upply'd by a very numerous
Garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of thirty thou&s;and Men, be|&s;ides
the Inhabitants, who&s;e number amounted to
as many, if not more, that were able to bear
Arms; The Weywode or Governour of the Place,
was one <HI>Michael Sehin,</HI> an intimate Friend of <HI>Zus|ki,</HI>
who being &s;ufficiently provided with Ammuni|tion,
Artillery, Provi&s;ions, and all other Nece&s;&s;aries
for a long Siege, was re&s;olved to defend it to the
la&s;t drop of Blood, knowing it to be the only place
of Importance in the whole Empire, which re|main'd
&s;tedfa&s;t in the Intere&s;t of <HI>Zuski&punc; Sigi&s;mund</HI>
being mi&s;guided by &s;ome of his flattering Courtiers,
as &s;oon as he had pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Bory&s;thenes,</HI> re&s;olved
upon an ha&s;ty March, and being cajol'd into a Belief,
that he was rather going to receive than force <HI>Smo|lensko,</HI>
leaving all his Cannon behind him, marched
with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed towards that City. He was
no &s;ooner come in &s;ight of it, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">he found him|&s;elf
mi&s;erably mi&s;taken, both in his Intelligence
and Purpo&s;e; the Garri&s;on making a furious&punc; Sally
upon him, and being afterwards &s;ummon'd to &s;ur|render
by <HI>Sapiha,</HI> the Chancellor of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> the
Weywod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Sehin</HI> rejected his Offers with Scorn.
There were not a few at that time in the Army,
who advi&s;ed the King not to hazard his Army in
the Siege of a Place, which being provided with a
numerous Garri&s;on, and re&s;olute in its Defence,
would prove a work of great difficulty to gain;
but to take hold of this favourable Juncture, which
invited him to <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> the Capital City of the Em|pire,
before they were re-inforced with the <HI>Swe|di&s;h</HI>
Auxiliaries; but the Opinion of the <HI>Lithuanian</HI>
Chancellour and his Friends, was mo&s;t prevailing,
who remon&s;trated, that a few Months would re|duce
&s;o great a Multitude, however well provided
at pre&s;ent, to di&s;tre&s;s, when re&s;train'd from Forage|ing
and bringing in Provi&s;ions, or at the wor&s;t,
that a vigorous Attack would in a little time, bring
them to better terms; by which the King having
<PB N="84" REF="182">
&s;ecured him&s;elf a &s;afe Retreat, might with the le&s;s
danger march to the Capital City of <HI>Mu&s;co.</HI> Pur|&s;uant
to this Re&s;olution, the King ordered all the
Avenues and Pa&s;&s;ages leading to the City, to be
taken up by his Cavalry, and afterwards by making
a Line of Circumvallation, to cut off all Commu|nication
betwixt the Garri&s;on and the Country.
But having not long after received certain Intel|ligence,
that the Place being provided with great
&s;tore of all Nece&s;&s;aries, this Attempt would in all
likelihood prove abortive, they alter'd their&punc; Re&s;o|lution,
it being judged mo&s;t advi&s;able, to change
the Blockado into a formal Siege.</P>
<P>For which purpo&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sigi&s;mund <HI>be&s;ieges</HI> Smolen|&s;ko.</NOTE> the King having ordered his
Cannon for Battery, and other In&s;truments for a
Siege to be carried thither out of <HI>Lithuania,</HI> the
City was be&s;ieged in due form. The King's attack
was carried on, on the We&s;t-&s;ide of the place, his
quarters extending from the Banks of the River
<HI>Bory&s;thenes</HI> to the South. The attack of the <HI>Co&s;acks</HI>
was on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, their Quarters reaching from
the South to the &s;ame River. The Sieur <HI>Potocki,</HI>
Palatine of <HI>Braclow,</HI> had his Po&s;t a&s;&s;igned him on
the North-&s;ide; on the oppo&s;ite &s;hoar of the <HI>Bory|&s;thenes,</HI>
to prevent any Succours from coming to the
Relief of the Town that way. But the Be&s;iegers
advanced but &s;lowly in their Works for want of
Foot; for, tho' the King had late<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y received a re|inforcement
of five thou&s;and <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> yet there
being not above ten thou&s;and Foot in his whole
Army (which according to the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Po|landers,</HI>
was chiefly compo&s;ed of Hor&s;e) the&s;e bear|ing
no proportion to &s;o numerous a Garri&s;on, they
were continually harra&s;&s;ed by the frequent Sallies
of the Be&s;ieged, who often drove them from their
Trenches, before they could be &s;econded by their
Hor&s;e. Their approaches being thus carried on,
not without great difficulty, a con&s;iderable time
was &s;pent, before they could po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of
&s;ome advantageous Po&s;ts near the Walls of the
City, which being very convenient for the Be&s;ieg|ers
<PB N="85" REF="182">
to fetch in their Supplies of fre&s;h Water, put
them to &s;ome Di&s;tre&s;s that way, yet not &s;o, but
that they had &s;ufficient Opportunity to furni&s;h
them&s;elves with it in the night-time, without be|ing
perceived by the Enemy, by rea&s;on of the
nearne&s;s of the River. Thus the Siege continued
with abundance of Toil, but &s;mall Succe&s;s; the
King, who now began to be &s;en&s;ible of his Error,
being re&s;olved upon a Punctilio of Honour, not
to leave the Place till it were reduced, co&s;t it what
it would; &s;o that many of the <HI>Poles,</HI> but e&s;pecial|ly
of the <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> paid with their Lives for their
King's Ob&s;tinacy, who might have been employed
with much more Probability of Succe&s;s again&s;t the
City of <HI>Mu&s;co.</HI></P>
<P>For, whil&s;t the King was thus wa&s;ting his Forces
before <HI>Smolensko;</HI> the <HI>Zuskians</HI> having received Ad|vice
of the approach of the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Troops, &s;ent
to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, began to concert mea&s;ures how
to remove at a further di&s;tance the <HI>Demetrian</HI>
Forces, that had lain &s;o long at their Doors. They
were not ignorant of the Inconveniencies, which
the <HI>Poles</HI> labour'd under in the <HI>Demetrian</HI> Camp.
They had &s;ufficient Intelligence of their Divi&s;ions
and Animo&s;ities in their Councils, occa&s;ioned by
the Multitude of their Chief Commanders, who
being &s;way'd more by their particular Intere&s;t and
Ambition, than the Good of the common Cau&s;e,
lo&s;t many times an Opportunity of annoying the
Enemy. This In&s;tability in their Councils, cau&s;ed
much Carele&s;ne&s;s in the whole Conduct of their
Affairs, which frequently turn'd to their great Di&s;|advantage,
as it happned in <HI>May</HI> in the &s;ame Year,
when a &s;harp Engagement hapning betwixt the
Inhabitants of the City of <HI>Mu&s;co</HI> and the <HI>Demetri|ans,</HI>
the&s;e had at fir&s;t the better of them; but
making a di&s;orderly Retreat, without the lea&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
and falling to plunder the Dead, gave the
Enemy opportunity to Rally, and being reinforced
with fre&s;h Troops out of the City, they &s;o furiou&s;|ly
charged the <HI>Poles,</HI> that they entirely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">outed

them, mo&s;t of their Foot being either kill'd or
taken Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The Di&s;grace they received not long after at
<HI>Twere</HI> mu&s;t chiefly be a&s;cribed to their divided
Coun&s;els; For the <HI>Poles,</HI> having got Intelligence
that the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> Auxiliaries were marching towards
<HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> &s;ent <HI>Zlarowski</HI> with three thou&s;and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">or&s;e

in their March. <HI>Zlarowski</HI> having had the good
Fortune to &s;urprize one of their Regiments, which
was advanced at &s;ome di&s;tance before the re&s;t&punc; he
cut them all to pieces; This &s;o alarm'd the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites,</HI>
who had put all the Hopes of their Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ety
in the&s;e Auxiliary Troops, that they march'd out
with their whole Strength, and join'd them near
the City of <HI>Twere.</HI> The <HI>Poles,</HI> having got Notice
of their March, &s;ent al&s;o a con&s;iderable Reinforce|ment

both Parties di&s;puting the Victory with great Ob|&s;tinacy;
The <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e attack'd the two Wings
of the Enemies with an irre&s;i&s;tible Courage, and
the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> fighting for the la&s;t Stake, behaved
them&s;elves like Men re&s;olv'd either to overcome or
die; notwith&s;tanding which, they were forced to
give Ground, both Wings being after a bloody and
ob&s;tinate Fight routed by the <HI>Poles,</HI> who killed
8000 (among whom were 1000 <HI>German</HI> Hor&s;e&punc;)
upon the Spot. But the Foot &s;tood all this while
unmovable, and had &s;everal times made <HI>Zla|rowski,</HI>
who commanded the main Body of the
<HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Army, give Ground, and tho' now left by
their Hor&s;e, had po&s;&s;e&s;t them&s;elves of an advan|tageous
Po&s;t, where they could not be attack'd
without great Di&s;advantage. The <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e
being extreamly tired by the Fatigues of the Day,
and the whole Army much inferiour in Number
to that of the Enemy, it was not thought advi&s;a|ble
to pur&s;ue them; but on the contrary, all the
able&s;t and mo&s;t experienced Officers were of O|pinion
to re&s;t contented with what Advantage
<PB N="87" REF="183">
they had gotten, and to withdraw to &s;ome more
advantageous Po&s;t. But <HI>Zlarowski,</HI> emulo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s of
the Honour the re&s;t had goten, would by no means
con&s;ent to their Advice, and being re&s;olved to try
his Fortune, whether he could in &s;ome Mea&s;ure
recover the Di&s;grace he had received in that day's
Action, would not &s;tir from his Po&s;t tho' ex|pos'd
to the Enemies Cannon. So that the re&s;t &s;ee|ing
him re&s;olute, and ob&s;tinate again&s;t their Coun|&s;els
they quartered them&s;elves in &s;ome of the ad|jacent
Villages. The Enemy having by &s;ome De|&s;erters,
got notice what Effects their divided
Coun&s;els had produced, &s;oon rally'd their Hor&s;e&punc;
and having rejoined their Foot, by break of Day&punc;
fell with &s;uch Fury upon the <HI>Poles,</HI> that &s;eeing
them&s;eves thus &s;urprized, and in no Capacity to
&s;econd one another, they fought their Way thro'
the Enemy, the Foot retiring to <HI>Twere,</HI> the Hor&s;e
making the be&s;t of their Way to their Camp near
<HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> with the lo&s;s of a great many of their
Companions, and all their Artillery and Bag|gage.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mu&s;covites&punc;</HI> flu&s;h'd with this happy Succe&s;s,
march'd directly to <HI>Twere,</HI> where they &s;tormed the
Ca&s;tle at three &s;everal times with more Courage
than Conduct; for the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Foot which got be|fore
them within the Place, repul&s;ed them every
time with great Slaughter; &s;o that, de&s;pairing of
carrying the Place, by rea&s;on of its numerous

&s;ome fre&s;h Regiments they forced the <HI>Poles</HI> to re|tire.
Be&s;ides this, the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of their Di&s;ci|pline
in the <HI>Demetrian</HI> Camp, had occa&s;ioned &s;everal
Seditions for want of Pay; &s;o that <HI>Demetrius,</HI> to
&s;atisfie their Demands, was forced to lay &s;uch hea|vy
Taxations upon the Provinces which had &s;ub|mitted

mo&s;t of the great Cities revolted, and
the Country refu&s;ed to pay any further Contribu|tions,
looking upon them as the Fuel that nouri&s;h|ed

In &s;ome Places they grew &s;o outrageous as to &s;eize,

therefore to maintain his Authority and to pro|tect

no que&s;tion, but that if King <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> could as
yet have been prevailed upon to transfer his Arms
from <HI>Smolensko</HI> to <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> that by his Authority
the&s;e Divi&s;ions in the <HI>Demetrian</HI> Camp might have
been &s;oon compo&s;ed, and the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> frighted by
the Acce&s;&s;ion of &s;o con&s;iderable a Force to their
Enemies, to have been brought to better Terms;
but in&s;tead of that, he ab&s;olutely re&s;olved not to
quit the Place till he had taken it, and his Army
being extreamly weakned by the long Continuance
of the Siege and the frequent Sallies of a numerous
Garri&s;on, and not receiving &s;ufficient Recruits out
of <HI>Poland,</HI> or at lea&s;t not &s;o opportunely as the ur|gent
State of his Affairs required, he took a Re|&s;olution
to draw his Subjects out of the Service of

which entirely ruin'd all his affairs in <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="184">
It was in vain, that his able&s;t Coun&s;ellours, re|pre&s;ented

<P>In the mean time, the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> began to feel the

King <HI>Sigi&s;mund,</HI> having got notice, that <HI>Volviowitz</HI>
the <HI>Zuskian</HI> General was, after the la&s;t Defeat&punc; retir'd
with a Body of ten thou&s;and Men under <HI>Czarow,</HI>
&s;ent thither part of his Army, the very &s;ight of
which, &s;o terrified the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> that without
&s;triking one Blow, they &s;urrendred to the Conque|rour's

had detatch'd a con&s;iderable Body from the Siege of
<HI>Smolensko,</HI> whom they expected to &s;ee every day at

mo&s;t of their Foreign Auxiliaries, in whom they mo&s;t
confided, the <HI>Germans</HI> having taken Service among

left to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the Power of two
Armies, that were on their march to be&s;iege them

<PB N="101" REF="190">
Plunge, how to extricate them&s;elves out of the&s;e
impending Mi&s;eries.</P>
<P>After various Debates among the Nobles, who
mo&s;t took to Heart the pre&s;ent mi&s;erable State of
their Country, they had recour&s;e to the &s;ame States
Policy, which had prov'd &s;ucce&s;sful to their Affairs
before, to wit, to try whether by rai&s;ing new Di|vi&s;ions
among the <HI>Poles</HI> and <HI>Demetrians,</HI> they
might not find once more an Opportunity to &s;ave
them&s;elves from this imminent Danger, which, if
not &s;oon prevented, threatned their infallible De|&s;truction.
To encompa&s;s this De&s;ign, it was pro|po&s;ed
to &s;eize upon the Great Duke <HI>Ba&s;ili Zuski</HI> and
to give it out that they were re&s;olved to put <HI>&V;la|di&s;laus,</HI>
the Son of <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> upon
the Throne of <HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> that thereby they &s;hould
infallibly ruin the Intere&s;t of <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and con|&s;equently
rid them&s;elves of a vile Impo&s;tor, who&s;e
very Name was become odious to them, and at the
&s;ame time, re&s;tore immediately Peace to their harra&s;|&s;ed
Country. It was repre&s;ented, that, tho' they ought
to look upon the <HI>Poles,</HI> as their mo&s;t dreadful and
mortal Enemies, that neverthele&s;s, their only Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
being now to get time, and to breath a little;
the <HI>Poles,</HI> inveigled by their fair Promi&s;es, would
&s;oon become &s;ecure, and furni&s;h them with an op|portunity,
either quite to elude the Election of <HI>&V;|ladi&s;laus,</HI>
or, if that was not thought advi&s;able, they
might find &s;ufficient Means, at one time or other,
to rid their hands of him, under pretence of his
Childhood, which, if well tim'd, they might make
u&s;e of &s;o favourable a Juncture, to endeavour to
return their Government into its antient Channel,
from whence it had been diverted by the Artifices
of their Enemies, and had been the occa&s;ion of all
the Mi&s;eries they had endured of late. This De|&s;ign,
laid upon deep Rea&s;ons of State, &s;ucceeded
at la&s;t according to their Expectation, by the mi&s;|management
of the <HI>Poles&punc;</HI> who were, by the good
Conduct of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> not long after, obliged
to leave that Empire, and re&s;tore to it that Repo&s;e,
<PB N="102" REF="191">
which with va&s;t Expences, and the effu&s;ion of a
great deal of Blood, they had robb'd it of, for
near twenty years before. The <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Boyars,
and Nobles, having thus concerted mea&s;ures among
them&s;elves, according to which, the Ruin of <HI>Zus|ki</HI>
was re&s;olved on, as the only means to encom|pa&s;s
the intended Deliverance of their native Coun|try,
it was by their In&s;tigation whi&s;per'd about
among the Populace, how that <HI>Ba&s;ili Zuski,</HI> the
pre&s;ent Great Duke, ought to be con&s;idered, as
the Chief Author of all their Misfortunes, who by
his Sorceries and Tyranny, had drawn down upon
the People of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> the vengeance of God Al|mighty;
and that by his Mi&s;carriages, they were
again plung'd into the&s;e Mi&s;eries, wherewith they
&s;aw them&s;elves environed pa&s;t all Redemption,
unle&s;s they took new mea&s;ures for their common
Safety.</P>
<P><HI>Zuski</HI> had, &s;ince his acce&s;&s;ion to the Crown, ren|dered
his Government very obnoxious to the Cen|&s;ures
of the Nobles; For, having mounted the
Throne, by Blood and fraudulent Means, he be|gan
to be jealous of his mo&s;t tru&s;ty Friends, and,
to gratifie his Fears, exerci&s;ed his Cruelties upon &s;e|veral
Per&s;ons of an eminent Rank, whom he cau&s;ed
to be put to Death upon no other Pretence, than
his having &s;ecret Intelligence of their Unfaithful|ne&s;s.
As his Reign was one continued Series of
Troubles, &s;o when he was at a Plunge, he u&s;ed to
have recour&s;e to Sorcerers and Witchcraft, and be|ing
infatuated by their Per&s;wa&s;ions, he committed
&s;uch Barbarities as are &s;carce to be named without
horror. It was upon this account, he cau&s;ed the
Wombs of big-bellied Women, to be ript open,
to make u&s;e of the immature Fruit, to accompli&s;h
his Enchantments, which, he was vainly per&s;wa|ded,
would be more efficacious again&s;t the <HI>Poles,</HI>
than his Sword. Some of his Wizzards having
foretold him, that one, who&s;e name was <HI>Michael,</HI>
&s;hould &s;ucceed him in the Throne, he cau&s;ed three
of his mo&s;t faithful Friends and Servants to be made
<PB N="103" REF="191">
away, for no other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e they bore
that name, which for all his barbarous Precautions,
was verified in the Per&s;on of <HI>Mich. Federowitz,</HI> the
pre&s;ent Czar's Grandfather. There were in the great
Church within the Ca&s;tle, among&s;t other Things of
great Value, thirteen Statues, repre&s;enting our Sa|viour
and the twelve Apo&s;tles, all of ma&s;&s;ie Gold,
each of them of the bigne&s;s of a Man, valued at
near three hundred thou&s;and Pounds Sterling.
<HI>Zuski</HI> being at la&s;t reduced to great Straights for
want of Money, and having, in vain, try'd all the
Skill of his Sorcerers, who were not able to &s;upply
his pre&s;ent Occa&s;ions, he had recour&s;e to the twelve
Apo&s;tles, whom he di&s;placed from their Station in
the Church, and having cau&s;ed them to be melted
down, made u&s;e of the Metal for the Payment of his
Soldiers. He had &s;o much Grace as to &s;pare the
Statue of our Saviour, which the <HI>Poles,</HI> not long
after, converted to the &s;ame u&s;e.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Enormities, being now by the Nobles,
who had con&s;pir'd his Ruin, improved to his di&s;|advantage,
the Populace (who&s;e Darling he was
before) prompted more by their Zeal for their
golden Statues, than the Love and Welfare of their
Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zuski <HI>de|po&s;ed.</HI></NOTE> &s;oon &s;hook hands with the Nobility; and

overjoy'd they were to &s;ee that Day which they ho|ped

by the Choice they had lately made of his Son
<HI>&V;ladi&s;laus</HI> for their Great Duke, humbly be&s;eech|ing
the King, that in regard of the near Intere&s;t he
now had in their Pre&s;ervation, he would vouch&s;afe
to take them and their afflicted Country into his
Royal Protection, as the only Means to revive the
former flouri&s;hing State of the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Empire,
which had been reduced to the very Brink of Ruin
by their inte&s;tine Divi&s;ions. That their late Ele|ction
having been unanimous and founded upon
Hopes of their future Felicity, they begg'd of his
Maje&s;ty not to deny them their earne&s;t Reque&s;t,

their Election by Crowning him Great Duke and
Emperour, with the u&s;ual Ceremonies, in the
Royal City of <HI>Mu&s;co.</HI> They related to him the
Conditions upon which he was to be received, as we
have related them in the foregoing Chapter; They
enlarged them&s;elves much in prai&s;e of the <HI>Greek</HI>
Religion, and how nece&s;&s;ary it would be for the
Prince to accommodate him&s;elf to the Rites
of the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Church, which they &s;aid,
ought to be looked upon as the Foundation-Stone
of that Monarchy, from whence depen|ded
the common Safety, both of Prince and Peo|ple;
<PB N="108" REF="194">
all which they recommended to his Royal
Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>King <HI>Sigi&s;mund,</HI> who was not ignorant that the&s;e
&s;ubtle In&s;inuations proceeded more from the pre|&s;ent
Nece&s;&s;ity of their Affairs, than any good Will
either to him&s;elf or the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Nation, was not
wanting to give them an An&s;wer &s;uitable to the
pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion. And having received their Me&s;|&s;age
with a very &s;erene Countenance and &s;eeming
Gladne&s;s, he an&s;wered them in general Terms;
That he could not but receive the Honour conferr'd
upon his Son by the Offer of the Crown of &s;o great
an Empire with a great deal of Gladne&s;s, but that
as the chiefe&s;t Satisfaction he took in their Election,
was their unanimous Con&s;ent, &s;o he a&s;&s;ured them,
that he &s;hould look upon it as an indi&s;pen&s;ible obli|gation,
to a&s;&s;i&s;t at all times hereafter their Country
with his Aids and Coun&s;els, by which means he ho|ped
a mutual good Corre&s;pondency might be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
betwixt th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e two potent neighbouring
Crowns of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> to their mutual
Advantage. And as to what related to the Parti|culars
of the Treaty, they being of &s;uch a Nature
as to de&s;erve a particular Con&s;ideration, he would,
after having well weighed the Matter, &s;end his full
In&s;tructions to his General <HI>Zolkievitzki,</HI> Re&s;ident in
the City of <HI>Mu&s;co,,</HI> with whom the whole Mat|ter
might be compleated at their own Homes,
to the Satisfaction, as he hoped, of both
Parties.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;adors being in all outward Appear|ance
very well &s;atisfied with this An&s;wer, there
pa&s;&s;ed abundance of Care&s;&s;es betwixt them and the
<HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Lords, by whom they were &s;umptuou&s;ly
fea&s;ted at &s;undry times, with &s;uch mutual Profe&s;|&s;ions
of Friend&s;hip, as if they had been but one
People; The &s;ame Kindne&s;s was &s;hewn betwixt
the <HI>Mu&s;covites&punc;</HI> and <HI>Poles</HI> in the City of <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI>
whereby the Inhabitants being inveigled into a pro|found
Security, the <HI>Poles</HI> found Means by degrees
to creep into the Ca&s;tle, to the Number of &s;ix or
<PB N="109" REF="194">
&s;even thou&s;and, which afterwards proved fatal to
that City.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;adors having not long after de|manded
their Audience of Leave from <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> in
order to their Departure; the King in return
to their Demand, asked from them the Sur|render
of <HI>Smolensko</HI> in the Name of Prince <HI>&V;la|di&s;laus,</HI>
elected and proclaimed Great Duke of <HI>Ru&s;|&s;ia;</HI>
unto which they having an&s;wered, That they
had nothing of it in their In&s;tructions, and that
they were of Opinion the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> would be unwil|ling
to &s;urrender a Place of &s;uch Importance
till the Great Duke were come in Per&s;on to the Ca|pital
City, and Crowned and &s;worn to the Perfor|mance
of the beforementioned Articles, they were
not permitted to depart till further Orders. For,
Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">g <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI> having fully weighed the whole
State of the Matter, and e&s;pecially their Refu&s;al
of the Surrender of <HI>Smolensko,</HI> began to be more
and more convinced of their fraudulent Dealings;
and knowing that it was not their free Choice, but
the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of their Affairs that had rai|&s;ed
his Son to the Throne, he had all the Rea&s;on
to fear, that when he had withdrawn his Forces
out of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> they would make their Advan|tage
by the Unexperience of his Son, and ju&s;tle
him out of the Throne. But if he &s;hould forbear
to &s;end him till he came to his riper Years, they
would from thence, without que&s;tion, take Occa|&s;ion
to recall their Choice, and elect another in his
&s;tead. And, con&s;idering that he had reduced them
to &s;uch Straights, as had made them take tho&s;e Mea|&s;ures
&s;o little &s;uitable to their Incinations, but meerly
invented to di&s;intangle them&s;elves out of their
pre&s;ent Di&s;tre&s;&s;es, he looked upon it not only as
inglorious by accepting their Conditions to receive
in&s;tead of impo&s;ing Laws upon them, but al&s;o
quite incon&s;i&s;tent with his own Intere&s;t and the
Safety of his Son.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="195">
All his Thoughts therefore, were bent upon the
Siege of <HI>Smolensko,</HI> which when taken, he
&s;uppo&s;ed he might appear among them as a Con|querour,
and pre&s;cribe &s;uch Laws to the dece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tful
<HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> as &s;hould be mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent both with
his Honour and Safety. This was the Re&s;olution
of <HI>Sigi&s;mund.</HI></P>
<P>But his able&s;t Coun&s;ellors were of a quite diffe|rent
Opinion; For, tho' they were no le&s;s &s;atisfied
in the deceitful Intentions of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> than
the King him&s;elf; yet did they not judge it advi&s;a|ble,
to drive Matters to extremities, and to com|mit
that to the hazard of the Sword, which might
be obtained without Oppo&s;ition. They repre&s;ent|ed
to the King, that the Conque&s;t of &s;o va&s;t an
Empire, could not be obtained without the effu&s;ion
of much Blood, and the Expence of va&s;t Trea|&s;ures;
whereas, if what had been &s;worn to by <HI>Zol|kievitzki,</HI>
by the King's Orders, were confirmed,
he might in one day, make him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of all
<HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> They advi&s;ed him therefore, not to give
the opportunity to an un&s;table People to take new
mea&s;ures, who perhaps, when driven to De&s;pair,
might &s;ide with <HI>Demetrius;</HI> which would take a|way
all his Pretences of invading that Empire,
&s;ince he had undertaken his Expedition under the
pretext of a&s;&s;i&s;ting him in the Recovery of his
Right; But to &s;end Prince <HI>&V;ladi&s;laus,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
a good Body of Troops, and &s;ome able Coun&s;el|lors,
to the City of <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> where he being receiv'd
and Crown'd Great Duke <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> might with their
A&s;&s;i&s;tance ea&s;ily elude the Practices of the <HI>Mu&s;co|vites.</HI>
That by this means, <HI>Smolensko</HI> would fall on
cour&s;e into his Hands, and his Army, be&s;ides this,
might be paid all their Arrears out of the Great
Duke's Trea&s;ure, as belonging to <HI>&V;ladi&s;laus</HI> their
Prince, who el&s;e, as the Ca&s;e now &s;tood; would
be an intolerable Burthen for the Commonwealth
of <HI>Poland.</HI> And as to what related to the Articles,
they might without much Difficulty, be either
quite evaded, or at lea&s;t delay'd, till the Prince,
<PB N="111" REF="195">
&s;trengthened with fre&s;h Supplies out of <HI>Poland,</HI>
&s;hould find him&s;elf in a Capacity to Rule this fal&s;e

judge mo&s;t convenient, and &s;uitable to his own In|tere&s;t.
But the&s;e whole&s;ome Coun&s;els had no
great Influence over the King, who being pre|po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
with a vain Punctilio of Honour, not to
ri&s;e from before <HI>Smolensko</HI> before it was taken, and
with the pernicious In&s;inuation of his Flatterers,
who per&s;waded him, that the Place was reduced
to that extremity, as not to be able to hold out
long again&s;t him, he re&s;olved to leave nothing un|attempted
which might contribute to the Rendi|tion,
or forcing of that important City.</P>
<P>For which Rea&s;on, he cau&s;ed a new Battery to
be rai&s;ed, from whence, and &s;ome others the <HI>Poles,</HI>
fired &s;o furiou&s;ly upon the Town, that after &s;ome

ruined two Ba&s;tions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Smolen|sko. <HI>&s;tor|med.</HI></NOTE> Upon which it was re&s;olved

Duke and Emperour, which they were very free to
promi&s;e, tho' they had not the lea&s;t Intention to
perform it, as <HI>Zarucki</HI> found afterwards to his
Co&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Poles</HI> were not unadverti&s;ed of the De&s;igns
of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> but the King's Forces before
<HI>Smolensko</HI> being &s;carce &s;ufficient to carry on the
Siege again&s;t a &s;trong Garri&s;on, he could not &s;pare
any to di&s;per&s;e the&s;e Levies, and the <HI>Poles</HI> within
the City of <HI>Mu&s;co</HI> had enough to do to maintain
their Po&s;ts, and keep that va&s;t Multitude of Peo|ple
in &s;ubjection; &s;o that the&s;e Levies, from a
&s;mall Beginning being improved into a great Bulk,
the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Forces which were quartered up and down
in the Country, to keep it in Obedience, were &s;o far
from being able to attack them, that they were
&s;carce &s;ufficient to keep on the Defen&s;ive.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the City, being now encou|raged
by the&s;e <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Lords appearing in Arms,
thought it now time to throw off the Mask, and to
give the <HI>Poles</HI> very &s;en&s;ible Proofs of their Aver&s;ion
towards them. A De&s;ign therefore was laid among
them, upon a Signal given to a&s;&s;emble and ma&s;&s;acre
all the <HI>Poles</HI> within the City.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Mu&s;co</HI> was at that time much big|ger
than it ever was before or &s;ince, by Rea&s;on of
the va&s;t Confluence of Strangers, who during the&s;e
inte&s;tine Commotions were retired thither out of all
the neighbouring Provinces for Sanctuary, &s;o that
it was computed to comprehend in its Circuit above
a Hundred and fifty Thou&s;and Hou&s;es. All this va&s;t
Multitude of Inhabitants being enrag'd to the high|e&s;t
Pitch again&s;t the <HI>Poles,</HI> were ready to lend a
<PB N="117" REF="198">
helping Hand to accompli&s;h the De&s;ign of the Con|&s;pirators,
they only wanting a Head to lead them
on to put it in Execution.</P>
<P>A thing of this Nature could not be carried on
&s;o privately, but that <HI>Gaziowski,</HI> who then com|manded
the <HI>Poles</HI> in Chief, had timely Notice of
their projected De&s;ign, but thinking it not advi&s;able
to be the fir&s;t Aggre&s;&s;or, he di&s;&s;embled his Notice,
and contented him&s;elf with fortifying the two
Quarters of the City called <HI>Catangorod</HI> or the Mid-City,
and <HI>Czargorod</HI> or the City-Royal, which be|ing
&s;urrounded with good Stone-Walls, and con|taining
the Ca&s;tle, with the Royal Palace, all the
Magazines, and great Hou&s;es of the Nobility and
Merchants, he propo&s;ed to him&s;elf as a &s;afe Retreat
upon all Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>The <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> General <HI>Gaziouski</HI> had &s;carce fini&s;hed
his Works, before the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> finding by the Pre|cautions
u&s;ed by the <HI>Poles,</HI> that their De&s;ign had
taken vent, re&s;olved to put it in Execution, tru&s;t|ing
more in their Number than their Conduct, and
having on the third day after <HI>Palm-Sunday</HI> drawn
together an incredible Number of People by the
Ringing of the Bells, they attack'd the <HI>Poles,</HI> with
a Fury pa&s;t all Belief, as Men re&s;olv'd either
to accompli&s;h their De&s;ign, or to die in the At|tempt.</P>
<P>The <HI>Poles,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Poles</HI> attacked in the City of <HI>Mu&s;co.</HI></NOTE> on the other Hand, being &s;urrounded

at la&s;t forced to give way to the Bravery of
the <HI>Poles,</HI> who made them retreat with the Lo&s;s of
near Ten thou&s;and Men on their &s;ide. No &s;ooner
had the <HI>Poles</HI> removed them from their Works, but
they &s;allied out with &s;ome thou&s;and Men, and ha|ving

Number of Hou&s;es, but al&s;o of Women,
Children and other helple&s;s Per&s;ons. The next day
the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> General, having received Intelligence
that mo&s;t of the Inhabitants of <HI>Mu&s;co</HI> were retired
to the Suburbs called <HI>Strelitza Slavoda,</HI> which lies
South of <HI>Cataygorod</HI> or the Mid-City, on the oppo|&s;ite
Shore of the River <HI>Moska,</HI> where they were di&s;pu|ting
the Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Stru&s;ius,</HI> who, with a good Bo|dy,
was come from <HI>Mal&s;aisko,</HI> upon the fir&s;t News
of the Tumult, to the Relief of his Countrymen,
he made a &s;trong Sally, and having cau&s;ed the &s;aid
Suburbs to be &s;et on fire in &s;everal parts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City of <HI>Mu&s;co</HI> burnt by the <HI>Poles&punc;</HI></NOTE> he burnt
it quite to the Ground, thereby facilitating the Pa&s;|&s;age
of the <HI>Poles</HI> who came to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;e|curing
to him&s;elf a free Communication, which
&s;tood him in great &s;tead afterwards upon &s;everal
Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>It is computed that a Hundred and twenty
Thou&s;and Hou&s;es were laid in A&s;hes by that ra|ging
Element, and that by the Fire and Sword
there fell near Two hundred Thou&s;and of the In|habitants
of all Sorts, be&s;ides an incredible Quantity
of Stores and Merchandices.</P>
<P>The Remainders of the Inhabitants &s;eeing their
City thus laid in A&s;hes, and them&s;elves &s;ufficiently
tamed by the Sword, implored the Mercy of the
conquering <HI>Poles,</HI> rejecting (as it is u&s;ual in &s;uch
Ca&s;es) the Fault upon a few of their Ringleaders,
who had paid for it with their Lives. The <HI>Poles</HI>
knowing them&s;elves not in a Capacity to do any fur|ther
Mi&s;chief, and being glad to have reduced them
to ask Quarter, granted it without Difficulty. But
as it was owing to the utmo&s;t nece&s;&s;ity of their Af|fairs,
&s;o this Truce &s;o earne&s;tly &s;ued for by the <HI>Mu&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ovites,</HI>
la&s;ted not long. For the Inhabitants of <HI>Mu&s;co</HI>
having invited <HI>Lepanovits, Pro&s;owecki, Zarucki,</HI> and
the re&s;t of the Leaders of the Army, we men|tioned
before, to come to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, they ad|vanced
with a Hundred thou&s;and Men towards the
City, upon who&s;e Approach having joined with
<PB N="119" REF="199">
their Forces, they forced the <HI>Poles</HI> into their Works
where they were &s;o clo&s;ely be&s;ieg'd, that they had
but one Pa&s;&s;age left open for their Communication
with the Country, which was that part on the other
&s;ide of the River <HI>Moska,</HI> where not long before
had &s;tood the Suburbs called <HI>Strelitza Slavoda,</HI> and
which they kept open a long time for the Conve|niency
of their Provi&s;ions and other Supplies, and
made frequent Sallies with great Succe&s;s on their
&s;ide, till at la&s;t by the ill Conduct of King <HI>Sigi&s;|mund,</HI>
they were forced to abandon that Po&s;t, and
&s;oon after, the whole City, to the irreparable de|triment
of the &s;aid King.</P>
<P>For whil&s;t the brave <HI>Poles</HI> were hardly pre&s;&s;ed
upon by their Enemies, he lay immovable at the
Siege of <HI>Smolensko,</HI> where his Affairs began to look
with a very ill Face. For the Soldiers, tired with
the long Continuance of the Siege, grew very un|ea&s;ie
for want of Pay, and their Clamours were
now ri&s;en to that height, that the King began to
dread every day a Mutiny, having not wherewithal
to &s;atisfie their ju&s;t Demands, nor any other Means
now left to rai&s;e Money, unle&s;s by calling together
a Dyet, which at la&s;t was re&s;olved on, and a Con|vention
of the E&s;tates appointed again&s;t the <HI>Sep|tember</HI>
next following; This Remedy, tho' &s;ome|what
&s;low, to &s;atisfie the greedy Appetite of the
Soldiers, yet were they (in Hopes o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> a happy Suc|ce&s;s
of that A&s;&s;embly) thereby appea&s;ed for that
time.</P>
<P>The King, in the mean time, con&s;idering with
him&s;elf, that the Mea&s;ures he had taken in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI>
contrary to the Advice of the Senate and his Coun|cil,
having proved abortive, would not be very a|greeable
to the Convention, he re&s;olved to make a|nother
Attempt for the Gaining of <HI>Smolensko,</HI> not
que&s;tioning but, that, if he could appear at the
next Dyet as a Conquerour, it would in a great
mea&s;ure take off the Blemi&s;h of his former Con|duct
in the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> War. A general A&s;&s;ault

day of <HI>June;</HI> the Soldiers encouraged by the Hopes
of the Booty of &s;o va&s;t and rich a City, &s;hewed a

<P>The A&s;&s;ault was made on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, by the
Palatine of <HI>Braclow,</HI> and on the We&s;t, where then
was the King's Quarters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Smolen|&s;ko <HI>&s;tor|med&punc;</HI></NOTE> by General <HI>Wyer,</HI> who
commanded the <HI>Germans.</HI> The Soldiers had found
means before break of day to rai&s;e Ladders in &s;eve|ral
places upon the Walls, unperceived by the Ene|my;
&s;o that, at the Signal given, the <HI>Germans</HI> fir&s;t
mounted and got up to the Top of the Walls, as
did al&s;o, not long after, the <HI>Poles,</HI> under the Com|mand
of the Palatine, without much Oppo&s;ition
from the Enemy, who being thus attack'd upon a
&s;udden, when they lea&s;t expected it, tho&s;e Forces
that were left for the Guard of the Walls were not
&s;ufficient to &s;top the furious A&s;&s;ault of the <HI>Poles.</HI>
But the De&s;cent from the Wall into the City being
very &s;teep, and the whole Garri&s;on having by this
time taken the Alarm, came flocking in great Num|bers
to the defence of their Walls, the Combat
grew very hot, the <HI>Poles</HI> pu&s;hing forward with
great Bravery to maintain the Advantage they had
got, and the Garri&s;on armed with De&s;pair fighting
like Men either re&s;olved to vanqui&s;h or die; &s;o that
the Di&s;pute remained very doubtful, and perhaps
would have ended to the Di&s;advantage of the <HI>Poles,</HI>
if the &s;ame <HI>Novodorski,</HI> whom we mentioned before
to have &s;o bravely attacked the Gate of S. <HI>Michael,</HI>
had not come to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>For, he having, whil&s;t they were engaged upon the
Walls, found means to apply a Petard at a certain
&s;mall Gate on the &s;ide of the <HI>Bori&s;thenes,</HI> he open'd a
&s;ufficient Pa&s;&s;age for him and the King's Guards which
were under his Command: In the Head of whom he,
being &s;econded by the Mar&s;hal of <HI>Lithuania, Doro|&s;tanski,</HI>
with &s;ome Volunteers, a&s;&s;aulted and entred
the Place, and having &s;lain a few who oppo&s;ed

they met to the Sword, Men, Women and Chil|dren,
without di&s;tinction of Age or Sex, &s;o that
the Streets were every where fill'd with Blood and
Slaughter.</P>
<P>A great Number of the Citizens run with their
Wives and Children, who made mo&s;t horrible out|cries,
to the great Church, where being a&s;&s;aulted
by the <HI>Poles</HI> they defended them&s;elves valiantly for
&s;ome time, but being at la&s;t overcome, they &s;et
fire to &s;ome Barrels of Powder that had been laid
up there, and thus blew them&s;elves, with &s;uch

rather to peri&s;h by this furious Element, than
the Hands of their bloody and mercile&s;s Ene|mies&punc;</P>
<P><HI>Sehin</HI> the Weywode or Governour was retired
with about twenty of the principal Officers into a
little Tower upon the Wall, where being &s;urroun|ded
and attacked on all &s;ides by the <HI>Poles,</HI> they de|fended
them&s;elves like Lyons, declaring that they
would not &s;urrender unle&s;s to one of the General
Officers of the Army. The Governour had u&s;ed
&s;ome of the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners very cruelly, &s;o that
dreading the Vengeance of the <HI>Poles,</HI> if he &s;hould
fall into their Hands, he was re&s;olved rather to die,
than &s;urrender to their Mercy. It happned very luc|kily,
that <HI>Potocki</HI> a General Officer among the <HI>Poles,</HI>
advanced near that Way, who having enquired in|to
the Cau&s;e of this Re&s;i&s;tance made by a few Men,
Word was brought him, that it was the Governo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">

one of the principal Officers; upon which he came
to the Place where <HI>Sehin</HI> with his Comrades yielded
them&s;elves immediately Pri&s;oners of War.</P>
<P>Thus was this great City, after having endured
a Siege of near two Years, taken in a few Hours,
in <HI>June,</HI> in the Year 1611. The Honour of which
ought chiefly to be a&s;cribed to the Bravery and
Conduct of <HI>Bartholomew Novodorski,</HI> Knight of
<HI>Maltha,</HI> and Captain of the King's Guards; who
by his timely opening a Pa&s;&s;age with his Petard
was the main In&s;trument of the Gaining of the
Place; without which that Attempt of Sealing the
Walls would in all likelihood have prov'd un&s;ucce&s;s|ful,
or at lea&s;t would not have been effected with|out
the Slaughter of a great many of the Be&s;iegers;
whereas it was now purcha&s;ed with the Lo&s;s of a
few among the <HI>Poles.</HI> The Place being thus &s;ecu|red,
&s;trict Orders were &s;ent throughout all the
Quarters of the City, to give Quarter, and that the
King had given the Pillage of the City to the Sol|diers,
as the Reward of their pa&s;t Fatigues and
Dangers. But the Soldiers, e&s;pecially the <HI>Germans</HI>
and <HI>Poles,</HI> not agreeing about the di&s;tribution of it,
were upon the point of coming to Blows, when
the King ordered all the Booty to be brought, into
one place in order to make an equal Dividend a|mong
them. But whil&s;t they were bu&s;ie in exe|cuting
the King's Command, a Fire hapning, by
what Accident is unknown, con&s;uming in a little
time all the va&s;t Wealth of that rich City, and burnt
a great part of it.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding a Siege &s;u&s;tained of near two
Years, there was found in the Magazines Provi&s;ions
and Ammunition for three Years longer; &s;o that
if they could have had fre&s;h Supplies of Men,
the Place might have been defended much longer,
the Garri&s;on and Inhabitants which at the beginning
of the Siege con&s;i&s;ted of near four&s;core, thou&s;and
Men, able to bear Arms, being reduced to eight or
nine thou&s;and, who neverthele&s;s might probably

Enemies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> being under a great Con&s;terna|tion
after the taking of <HI>Smolensko,</HI> who expecting
no le&s;s than to &s;ee the whole <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Army in a little

by the Succe&s;s of their King, di&s;puted e|very
Inch of Ground with the Enemy, who, not|with&s;tanding
their va&s;t Number, were not able to
drive them from that Po&s;t by which they kept
a Communication with the Country.</P>
<P><HI>Sigi&s;mund,</HI> on the other Hand, was advi&s;ed by his

Victory, but to improve it to the utmo&s;t, by carrying
the Terrour of his victorious Arms to the Gates of
the Capital City, where having a con&s;iderable Par|ty,

<P>But King <HI>Sigi&s;mund,</HI> as if over&s;wayed by &s;ome

the Extremities of Famine with an unparallell'd
Re&s;olution. For after having con&s;umed every
thing that was eatable, not only Hor&s;es, Cats, Dogs,
Rats, Mice, and other living Creatures, but al&s;o
the Leather and Coverts of their Trunks and Sad|dles;
they proceeded to Human Fle&s;h, feeding
upon the Carca&s;&s;es of their Comrades. But this
having in a little time cau&s;ed a mo&s;t violent Conta|gion

their Ob&s;tinacy was forced to yield to the Extre|mity

together all his able&s;t Coun&s;ellours and mo&s;t expe|rienced

done. There were not a few who advi&s;ed him to
lay a&s;ide all further Thoughts of the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI>
Crown, and, in a far advanced Sea&s;on, not to ex|po&s;e
his Per&s;on and the whole Army to eminent
Danger among a Treacherous People. But the
major Part were of Opinion, that the Pretences to
<PB N="140" REF="210">
the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Empire ought not to be quited at &s;o ea|&s;ie
a Rate; that if he, without any further Delay,
advanced into the Heart of the Country, it was
not improbable that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> over-awed by
his Pre&s;ence at the Head of a good Army, whil&s;t
their Affairs were yet in an un&s;ettled Condition,
might be induced rather to adhere to their former

afre&s;h to the Hazards of a ruinous War. And that
in ca&s;e they &s;hould be di&s;appointed in their Expecta|tion,
it would be more glorious for them to pro|cure
an honourable Peace with their Swords in Hand,
than &s;hamefully to turn their Backs to their Ene|mies,
whereby they would be encouraged to carry
the War into the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rritories.</P>
<P>The King having given his Approbation to the
latter, it was re&s;olved to march immediately to|wards
<HI>Federovi&s;cum,</HI> where having &s;et up their
Head Quarters, the King detached a con&s;iderable
Body of Hor&s;e, to advance to the very Walls of the
City of <HI>Mu&s;co.</HI> They were no &s;ooner come within
&s;ight of that City, but they were received with
good &s;tore of Shot from the Walls, which being
&s;econded by a furious Sally, the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e were
forced to retire with the Lo&s;s of &s;ome of their
Companions. The King judging by the Entertain|ment
given to his Troops before the Imperial City
that the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> had laid a&s;ide all Thoughts of
receiving his Son <HI>Vladi&s;laus</HI> for their Great Duke,
and finding him&s;elf not in a Capacity at pre&s;ent to
force them to a Compliance, was uncertain what
Mea&s;ures to take. The wor&s;t of all was, that the
<HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> in the circumjacent Provinces, upon the
fir&s;t News of the Surrender of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI>
and the Approach of the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Army, had carried
all their Provi&s;ions into their &s;trong Holds; &s;o that
King <HI>Sigi&s;mund</HI>'s Army which con&s;i&s;ted mo&s;t of Ca|valry,
was in great Di&s;tre&s;s for want of Forage
in a Country where the Winter-Sea&s;on affords no|thing

makes encamping almo&s;t intolerable to the Soldiers.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="210">

was incapable of committing any Crimes, &s;o her

<P>The Father having ob&s;erved &s;omething more than

to lend him his Wifes Pearls and other Jewels,
which were of a con&s;iderable Value. His Friend ha|ving

<P>He had &s;ome time before upon the Per&s;wa&s;ion of
a certain <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Gentleman writ a Letter with his
own Hand to the Patriarch of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> in which
he had writ, That he was a <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> born, and
received the Name of <HI>Timoska</HI> at his Bapti&s;m.
That he had once (when he was at the <HI>Ottoman</HI>
Court) been tempted to enter the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Empire
with an Army of two hundred thou&s;and <HI>Tartars,</HI>
but that he had been diverted from this pernicious
De&s;ign by the Guardian-Angel of <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> That
thereupon being re&s;olved to lay a&s;ide all De&s;igns a|gain&s;t
his Native Country, he had quitted <HI>Turk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>
with an Intention to return into <HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> That
it would el&s;e have been no difficult Matter for him
to have made his E&s;cape out of Pri&s;on if he had
not &s;tayed for the Great Duke's Command.</P>
<P>This Letter being look'd upon as a material
Point to overcome his Ob&s;tinacy, was produced and
read in his Pre&s;ence, but this had no more Influence
over him than the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Spilki,</HI> whom he
called a Cheat who had conterfeited the Letter to
<PB N="161" REF="220">
his De&s;truction. To confirm which, he writ ano|ther
Letter &s;o different both in the Stile and Chara|cter
from the former, that the mo&s;t quick-&s;ighted

them.</P>
<P>His Highne&s;s the Duke of <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> &s;eeing all their
Endeavours of making a true Di&s;covery of the
Impo&s;ture to prove un&s;uce&s;sful, ordered &s;ome of
his Privy Council to examine him, and to try
whether, out of his former Depo&s;itions they might
not be able to convince him concerning the true
State of his Affairs. They asked him, For what
Rea&s;on he was pro&s;ecuted by the Great Duke;
what could be the Rea&s;on of his having con|ceived
&s;o particular a Prejudice again&s;t his Per&s;on?
What Hou&s;e and Family he was de&s;cended of?
And whether he were of any Kin to the Great
Duke? He an&s;wered, That he was no Kin&s;man of
the Great Duke, fora&s;much as his Father was a
Prince born; whereas the Great Duke's Father was
but a Gentleman; That he was a <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> by
Extraction, but born and brought up in <HI>Poland;</HI>
That he was Hereditary Lord of <HI>Hukagina Severska&punc;</HI>
in the Province of <HI>Novogarka Severskio,</HI> upon the
Frontiers of <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> That his Name was <HI>Johan|nes

as much as <HI>Zuski;</HI> That his Fathers Name was <HI>Ba|&s;ili

<P>But the&s;e Depo&s;itions varying much from what
he had publickly profe&s;&s;ed before, that he was Son

<P>But to return to <HI>Moro&s;ou,</HI> who having weather|ed
this Point, and relying upon the Fidelity of
<HI>Ilia Danilovits Milo&s;lauski,</HI> he took the fir&s;t favou|rable
Opportunity to &s;peak to the Great Duke con|cerning
him, and thence to extoll the Beauty and
De&s;erts of the two Gentlewomen his Daughters.
The&s;e Commendations having rai&s;ed in the Great
Duke a de&s;ire to &s;ee them, he &s;ent to them under

that he di&s;patched one immediately to her Father
to bring him the welcom News that the Czar in|tended
to honour him with his Alliance, and to
marry his elde&s;t Daughter.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;ily imagined, that as <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ilo&s;lauski</HI> was not
altogether unprepared for it, &s;o he received the
Me&s;&s;age&punc; with the mo&s;t profound Re&s;pect, and
without being in the lea&s;t di&s;compo&s;ed, returning
his mo&s;t humble Thanks to his Czari&s;h Maje&s;ty for
the Honour he intended to do his Family&punc; Some

at the Wedding without a pre&s;ent Supply, he or|der'd
them a con&s;iderable Sum of Money to put them
in an Equipage &s;uitable to their Pre&s;ent Condition.
The Marriage Ceremony was performed in the be|ginning
of the Year 1647,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Young Great Duke <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> but very privately for

<P>The next thing <HI>Boris Moro&s;ou</HI> had to do, was to

and Si&s;ter to the Empre&s;s, which having been
&s;oon granted, he married her in eight days after; &s;o,
that his former Intere&s;t being now &s;trengthned by
this new Alliance, his Fortnue was e&s;tabli&s;hed beyond
the reach of his Enemies. But, his Content at home
was not altogether an&s;werable to his great Fortune
at Court; For, he being a Per&s;on pretty well ad|vanced
in Years, and &s;he a brown Bux&s;ome
La&s;s, found her&s;elf deceived in a great mea&s;ure in
her Expectation; &s;o that in&s;tead of Children, Jea|lou&s;ies

&s;ome Per&s;ons, among whom was al&s;o an <HI>Engli&s;h|man,</HI>

removed mo&s;t of the Nobility from Court, but, by
degrees&punc; ca&s;t off all &s;uch old Officers of the Hou&s;|hold
as were yet remaining, in who&s;e &s;tead, they
brought in their own Kindred and Creatures, who

<P>Among others, they had made one <HI>Leponti-Step|panovits-Ple&s;&s;ou,</HI>

which he was not ready to undertake. He would
receive Pre&s;ents from both Parties, and afterwards
leave them in the lurch. But not content with
this&punc; his common Practice was, to &s;uborn fal&s;e Wit|ne&s;&s;es,
who&s;e employment was to bring in Charges
again&s;t &s;uch of the Citizens of <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> as he knew
to be rich enough to redeem them&s;elves out of his
Per&s;ecutions; For, whenever they fell into his

to purcha&s;e their Liberty and his Favour with the

the Great Duke's Founders, Furbi&s;hers, Cannoneers,
Armourers, Smiths and Carpenters, who wrought

make u&s;e of their Money, to his own Advantage;

<P>They had al&s;o found out another Invention to
rai&s;e the Price of Salt from twenty to thirty Pence

<P>But the main difficulty was, who among them all
dur&s;t be &s;o venture&s;ome as to deliver the Petiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">;
&s;o that no body being willing to undertake that
Task, a certain day was appointed to give it to the
Great Duke him&s;elf with joint Con&s;ent&punc; as he
&s;hould come out of the Ca&s;tle to go to his Devo|tion.
They were as yet not &s;o bold as to dare to
attempt any thing again&s;t <HI>Moro&s;ou,</HI> by rea&s;on of
his near Alliance to the Great Dutche&s;s, tho' they
knew him to be the main I&s;trument of the&s;e Cala|mities
they &s;uffered, but their Petition was, for the
pre&s;ent, chiefly levell'd again&s;t <HI>Lepont Stepanovits
Ple&s;&s;ou,</HI> who by his mo&s;t barbarous Exactions being
become in&s;upportable to them, they de&s;ired, that
he might be removed from his Office, and his
Place be &s;upplied by &s;ome Per&s;on of known Inte|grity,
of whom the People might expect more Ju|&s;tice.
They had watched &s;everal Opportunities to
deliver it to the Prince him&s;elf as he was going to
his Devotions or Diverti&s;ements, but in vain; for
the <HI>Boyars,</HI> who attended his Per&s;on had always
took it from them, telling them that they would
make a Report of it to the Great Duke; but this
being done according to the In&s;tructions received
from <HI>Moro&s;ou,</HI> the Petition was not as much as an|&s;wered,

their Complaints to the Great Duke by way of
Mouth. The &s;ixth of <HI>July,</HI> in the Year 1648&punc; was
pitch'd upon as a day fit for the execution of their
De&s;ign, when they knew the Great Duke was to
be pre&s;ent at a Proce&s;&s;ion to be made to a Mona&s;te|ry
in the City, called <HI>Stertenski.</HI></P>
<P>The People were got early together in the Morn|ing,
in the great Market-place before the Ca&s;tle, to

&s;ee him and his Cavalcade pa&s;s by as they were wont
to do upon &s;uch like Occa&s;ions; But, whether it
was that they did not think them&s;elves &s;trong
enough, other that their Leaders were not
pre&s;ent, they did not make the lea&s;t Signs of di&s;&s;a|tisfaction
at his going to the Mona&s;tery&punc; But, at his
return, they broke through tho&s;e that attended the
Great Duke, came up to him, &s;tay'd him, and
taking hold of his Hor&s;es Bridle, intreated him to
take their pre&s;ent Ca&s;e into his Con&s;ideration, to
hearken to the ju&s;t Complaints of his Subjects, con|cerning
the Inju&s;tices and Violences committed by
<HI>Ple&s;&s;ou,</HI> de&s;iring that a Per&s;on of known Integrity
might be put in his Place, who &s;hould better di&s;|charge

<P>The Great Duke was not a little &s;tartled at this
unexpected procedure of the populace, but di&s;&s;em|bling
both his Surprize and Re&s;entment, he &s;poke
to them with a very chearful Countenance, telling
them, that he was much troubled to under&s;tand the

Mi&s;management of <HI>Ple&s;&s;ou,</HI> that he would forth|with
examine the whole Matter, and take care that

their ju&s;t Complaints.</P>
<P>The Generality of the people appeared to be well
&s;atisfied with the Great Dukes Promi&s;e, which they
te&s;tified by their joyful Acclamations; but &s;ome
thronging &s;till about the Great Duke's Hor&s;e, the
Boyars who attended at this Solemnity, being for
the mo&s;t part Friends of <HI>Ple&s;&s;ou,</HI> gave abu&s;ive Lan|guage
to tho&s;e who were near to the Czar, thru&s;t|ing
&s;ome away, and &s;triking others with their Whips,
which &s;o incen&s;ed the Populace, that the Stones
began to fly about the Courtiers Ears as thick as

Populace that were thronging into the Ca&s;tle Gates,
but their re&s;i&s;tance proving fruitle&s;s, by rea&s;on of

<P>But this was only the Prologue to the en&s;uing
Tragedy. For from thence they went &s;traightway

judging, not without rea&s;on, that they would al&s;o

<HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> make Provi&s;ion of again&s;t the Winter, to
&s;erve their Stores; and to take away all &s;u&s;picion,
he had cau&s;ed a good number of Flitches of Bacon
to be laid acro&s;s of them. He had &s;carce had lei&s;ure
enough to prepare this retiring place, before the
Clamours of the approaching Rabble gave him &s;uffi|cient

that time, if he had not been betray'd by one of
his Servants, who being inticed by a good Summ of
Money which was immediately given him, &s;hew'd

The enraged Multitude, without any further delay,
draggs him out by the Heels into the &s;treets, where

done, they threw his Body upon the Dunghil, Pil|lag'd

dur&s;t not attempt to &s;top their Pa&s;&s;age, but in&s;tead

<P>About Mid-night &s;ome Foreigners looking with

Duke's Provi&s;ion, they perceived, at &s;ome di&s;tance,
a Monk with a Sack upon his back coming towards
them, as if he carried a very great Burthen, and com|ing
near to them, they asked him what made him
thus blow and be all in a &s;weat? He to told them,
that he had made all the ha&s;te he could, to come
to quench the Flames' that if they would but lend
him a helping Hand, to throw the Body (which he
&s;hew'd them) of the cur&s;ed <HI>Ple&s;&s;ou</HI> into the Fire,

him the good Office, and to help him to ca&s;t the

<P>Tho&s;e in the Ca&s;tle-having thus weathered the
Storm that threatned them, the following days were
taken up in Con&s;ultations how to continue this Calm
among the People, and by which means to pre&s;erve
<HI>Moro&s;ou</HI> from falling into their Hands: For which
rea&s;on, the Patriarch having &s;ent for tho&s;e among

by their Spiritual Exhortations, and to repre|&s;ent
to them in the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate manner that
could be, the Re&s;pect and Obedience due to their
Sovereign. The Great Duke having al&s;o taken off
the New Impo&s;ition upon Salt, and Promi&s;ed to
&s;uppre&s;s all Monopolies lately &s;et up by his Mini&s;ters,
&s;upply'd the Places of the Executed <HI>Trochani&s;tou</HI>

cau&s;ed <HI>Ilia Danilovits,</HI> his Father-in-law, to invite
the Chief Citizens of the &s;everal Profe&s;&s;ions in
the City of <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> who were very &s;plendidly and
kindly Entertained at his Palace for &s;everal days

<P>Having thus prepared his way, he took the op|portunity

with the &s;ame <HI>Nikita Ivanovits Romanow,</HI> who
had been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful before in appea&s;ing the Tu|mult,
and now rid by his left &s;ide, he &s;poke to the
People, and told them, That he had been extreamly
troubled to under&s;tand the Violences and Injuries
committed by <HI>Trochani&s;tou</HI> and <HI>Ple&s;&s;ou,</HI> upon his
good Subjects, who&s;e welfare was very dear to him;
that tho&s;e Extortions executed under his Name and
Authority, had been quite contrary to his Inclina|tions
and Commands: And that therefore having
let them &s;uffer condign Puni&s;hment for their Vil|lanies,
he had put in their Places Per&s;ons of known
Integrity and Ability, whom he believed would be
acceptable to the People, as knowing them to be
Per&s;ons, that would execute Ju&s;tice without Cor|ruption
or Partiality. That he had already aboli&s;hed
the New Impo&s;ition upon Salt, and would take
care, that all Monopolies newly introduced by his
Mini&s;ters, &s;hould be &s;uppre&s;s'd; That he for the

he was not forgetful of what he had promi&s;ed them
&s;ometime before concerning <HI>Boris Ivanovits Moro&s;ou,</HI>
and that he was obliged to confe&s;s, that he had
tran&s;acted many things, which he would not in
any wi&s;e ju&s;tifie; but that on the other Hand, he
had &s;o much confidence in his good People, as to
hope they would excu&s;e him,. if at this time he
could not immediately re&s;olve to condemn him to
Death. That this being his fir&s;t Reque&s;t, he lived
in hopes they would not deny it him, which was,
that for once they would pardon the pa&s;t Mi&s;car|riages
of <HI>Moro&s;ou,</HI> on whom he de&s;ired them to
look as one who had been the Guardian of their
Prince, and had Married the Great Dutche&s;s's Si&s;ter,
who upon this double account mu&s;t needs be very
dear to him, and con&s;equently that it would be the
harde&s;t thing in the World, for him to con&s;ent to his
Death. That he him&s;elf would be an&s;werable for
his future Good Behaviour, not que&s;tioning but
that he would behave him&s;elf &s;o as that they &s;hould
not have the lea&s;t rea&s;on to complain of him; and,
that if they would declare him incapable by their
unanimous Vote, of being admitted into his Coun|cel
for the future, he &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;s'd.</P>
<P>The Great Duke being then not twenty Years of
Age, and of a very tender Con&s;titution, could not
forbear to accompany his la&s;t words with &s;ome
Tears, which &s;o moved the People, that they cried
out with one Voice, <HI>Long live our Great Duke, God
grant him a long and happy Reign, God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s and the Great
Duke's Will be done.</HI> The Czar having given them
his Thanks, and extolled their Zeal and Affection
for his Per&s;on, returned to the Ca&s;tle well &s;atisfied
<PB N="184" REF="233">
in having been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, to reconcile his Bro|ther-in-law
to the Citizens of his Imperial City of
<HI>Mu&s;co.</HI></P>
<P>Some days after, the Great Duke according to
Cu&s;tom, went a Pilgrimage to the Mona&s;try of
<HI>Troitza,</HI> about Three&s;core Miles from <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> when
<HI>Moro&s;ou</HI> took this opportunity of appearing again the
fir&s;t time in Publick. As he went through the City
he was uncovered, Saluting the People on both &s;ides
of the way with great Submi&s;&s;ion. He countenan|ced
the Old Nobility for &s;ome time, and ever after
laid hold on all occa&s;ions to gratifie the People, and
a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who Addre&s;s'd them&s;elves to him in any
Bu&s;ine&s;s they had at Court; &s;o that in a little time
there appear'd a great change in the Affairs of the
Government of <HI>Mu&s;covy;</HI> and <HI>Moro&s;ou</HI> became the
Favourite of the People, and the Patron to all
Strangers, maintaining his Greatne&s;s till his Old
Age, when he died much lamented by the People, but
not the Nobility; and as much beloved by his Prince
as he had been always &s;ucce&s;sful in his Coun&s;els.</P>
<P>But to return where we left off, notwith&s;tanding
this Remarkable Alteration in the Government,
there hapned not long after another Revolt, which,
if it had not been timely prevented by the vigilan|cy
of tho&s;e at the Helm, might have proved of
dangerous Con&s;equence to the Empire, which was
occa&s;ioned thus:</P>
<P>Some differences were ari&s;en betwixt the two

the Payment of their Debts. The&s;e differences im|proved

height, that both States &s;eem'd to be threatned with
an inevitable War, unle&s;s prevented by a &s;peedy
Compo&s;ition: In order to which the Great Duke

He employed his Spies in every Corner, &s;o that
there was &s;carce any Fea&s;t, great Meeting, Burial,

it happened to <HI>Peter Solticove</HI> a <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI> Lord,
and Governour of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia minor.</HI> This <HI>Solticove</HI> u|&s;ed
to keep the Arrears of the Soldiery in his Hands
to improve it to his Advantage by Merchandi&s;ing

found nothing but a wooden Spoon, and the Peti|tion

Concern for this Mi&s;hap, and &s;ending immediately
to <HI>Solticove</HI> the Governour of that Province, he
checked him &s;everely, telling him that he was

that he de&s;erved to receive the &s;ame Treatment;
That however he would &s;pare his Life for this time,
<PB N="191" REF="236">

ordering him not to appear for the future at Court,

<HI>Milo&s;lauski</HI> was a Man of a very &s;trong Body and
goodly A&s;pect, bold, and of great Judgment, ra|ther
feared than beloved by the Czar; but his In|tere&s;t
was upheld by his Daughter. It is related of
him, that he had &s;o prodigeous a Memory, as to
have perfectly well known all the the Commi&s;&s;ion
Officers of an Army of a Hundred Thou&s;and Men,
(of which he was Generali&s;&s;imo) where they Quar|tered,
and what their Qualifications were. He was
al&s;o Lord High Trea&s;urer of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and had &s;e|veral
other Offices be&s;towed upon him, all which
he managed with great dexterity. Tho' he was
pretty well advanced in Years, he was a great Ad|mirer
of the fair Sex, and for his Satisfaction enter|tained
a good Number of very hand&s;om <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> and
<HI>Tartarian</HI> Female-Slaves. His eager pur&s;uit after
amorous Plea&s;ures had almo&s;t lo&s;t him the Czar's
Favour; as an Apoplexy di&s;abled him at la&s;t in
Body and Mind, &s;o as to know no Body without
being told.</P>
<P>He was &s;ucceded in his high Employments, by
the ju&s;t now mentioned <HI>Na&s;hockin,</HI> who was al&s;o
made Chancellor of the Amba&s;&s;adors Office, and
Governour of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia Minor.</HI> He was a Per&s;on of
more than ordinary Integrity, not to be corrupted
by Pre&s;ents or other Illegal means; very &s;ober and
indefatigable in Bu&s;ine&s;s. The fir&s;t proofs of his
great Capacity he gave at the Conclu&s;ion of the
Peace betwixt the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> and <HI>Poles,</HI> to the no

<PB N="192" REF="237">
the League betwixt the Great Duke and <HI>Swedeland.</HI>
It was he that &s;ettled the Silk Trade upon a good
Foundation through <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and &s;hew'd them the
way, how the <HI>Indian</HI> Trade might be drawn that
way. He Reform'd and new Modell'd the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>

were before that time brought to <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> with no
le&s;s Trouble to the Pri&s;oners than Charge to the
Czar. He was a great Admirer of Monarchy, and
a Patron of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> as on the other hand, <HI>Bog|dan
Matfeilt</HI> always was a &s;ecret Enemy both to
<HI>Na&s;hockin</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> but a great Friend of the
<HI>Dutch,</HI> who u&s;ed to purcha&s;e his Favour by great
Pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>This <HI>Bogdan</HI> was bred up with the Czar from a
Child, and was much of the &s;ame Age. He was Lord
High Sreward of the Hou&s;hold, having in his di&s;|po&s;al
all Dome&s;tick Affairs. He u&s;ed to be called
the Whi&s;pering Favourite, becau&s;e the Czar asked
his Advice oftner in his Clo&s;et than at the Councel-Board.
It was by his Connivance that the <HI>Jews</HI> got
&s;ecretly footing in that Court and the City of <HI>Mu&s;|co;</HI>
whereas before that time they were abominable
to the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> becau&s;e they &s;upplied him with

would frequent Mid-night Prayers, &s;tanding four
or five hours together pro&s;trating him&s;elf to the
Ground. During the great Fa&s;ts, he would eat but
three Meals a Week, being contented for the re&s;t,
with a piece of Brown Bread and Salt, a pickled
Mu&s;hroon or Cucumber, and a Cup of Quas, or
&s;mall Mead. In &s;hort, it has been ob&s;erved of him,
that no Monk was ever more ob&s;ervant of the Ca|nonical
hours, than he of Fa&s;ts; it having been
computed, that he fa&s;ted above Eight Months in
the Year. He would al&s;o frequently appear at the
Proce&s;&s;ions bare-headed and on foot, and was al|ways
a declared Patron of the <HI>Mu&s;covite</HI> Church;
notwith&s;tanding which, he would &s;ometimes make
bold with the Church Revenue upon Loan, in
time of War, which he was not very careful to re|pay,
knowing that the Church Trea&s;ury, which is
&s;upplied out of the be&s;t part of the Empire, may now
and then di&s;pen&s;e with a Lo&s;s for the benefit of the
Publick. He al&s;o made an Ordinance to re&s;train
the profu&s;e Bounty of dying Men to the Clergy;
neither would he ever &s;uffer a Mona&s;tery to be
Founded without his Licen&s;e.</P>
<P>Every <HI>Good-Friday</HI> he u&s;ed to vi&s;it in the Night
all the Pri&s;ons in the City of <HI>Mu&s;co,</HI> to take Per&s;o|nal
Cogni&s;ance of all the Pri&s;oners; among whom
he would buy out &s;ome that were in Debt, and
relea&s;e others that were Criminals; and be&s;tow
&s;ometimes great Summs for the u&s;e of &s;uch as he
knew to be really nece&s;&s;itated. He would cau&s;e
the Empre&s;s to do the &s;ame, and to redeem yearly
a certain number of Women out of Pri&s;on. He
ordered al&s;o at about &s;even or eight Miles di&s;tance
from the Imperial City, Work-Hou&s;es to be built
for Hemp and Flax, in that good Order, Beauty
and Capacity, that they were &s;ufficient to Employ
all the poor in the Kingdom with Work; having

&s;ettled for that u&s;e a good many Miles of wa&s;te
Lands, by which he improved the Manufactury of
the Country, and fed his Labourers at a very
cheap rate. He A&s;&s;ign'd that part of the Building
where the Women were Employ'd, for the U&s;e

him to be in great favour with the Czar, he was
not without rea&s;on afraid, that his Depo&s;itions
might be interpreted by the adver&s;e Faction, as
proceeding from Envy or Malice, and con&s;equent|ly,
in&s;tead of &s;erving his Prince, turn to his own
de&s;truction, he re&s;olved to proceed with as much
caution as po&s;&s;ibly he could in a Matter of &s;o much

<P>For which purpo&s;e having one day met a cer|tain

he was fully re&s;olved not to hide it any long|er,
they went by joint-con&s;ent to make their Di&s;|covery

&s;udden Change of his Countenance and his con|fu&s;ed

him from his Mini&s;try, of which the two follow|ing
relations appeared to be the Fatal Pre&s;ages.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was undertaken by a private per&s;on,
who having watched his opportunity one morning
as <HI>GalliZin</HI> was going in his Sledge to the Czar's
Palace, threw him&s;elf upon him, and &s;eized him
by the Beard to &s;tab him. But whil&s;t he was draw|ing
his dagger which (according to the <HI>Mu&s;covian</HI>
fa&s;hion) &s;tuck in his Girdle, the Princes Servants

all his endeavours in vain, he &s;poke to</HI> GallaZin
<HI>with unparrallell'd re&s;olution, in the following man|ner:</HI>
Infamous Tyrant, It is not the fear of death,
but the regret I feel of being di&s;appointed in my de&s;ign,
that you &s;ee me thus changed in my Countenance; But
know, that tho' I have been &s;o unfortunate as to fail
in this attempt, to deliver my Native Country from the

of the Earth; tho' this hand has been un&s;ucce&s;sful in
making thee a Sacrifice to the ju&s;t re&s;entments of thy

three hundred Citizens, who, out of pity to the people,
that daily groan under the burthen of thy mo&s;t intole|rable
oppre&s;&s;ions, have con&s;pired thy final de&s;truction;
there will be &s;ome, that will take &s;urer mea&s;ures than
I have done.</P>
<P>He was going on in his di&s;cour&s;e, if he had
not been dragged away immediately to Pri&s;on,
where after having been put to the Rack, he was
executed privately, for fear of incen&s;ing the
people.</P>
<P>This Outrage was &s;oon after followed by ano|ther;
le&s;s dangerous in its Contrivance, but &s;uffi|ciently
<PB N="211" REF="246">
convincing to <HI>GalliZin</HI> of the Sentiments the
people had of his Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>He was then ju&s;t upon his departure for the
Army, which he was to Command, as General, a|gain&s;t

Coffin was found at his Pallace Gate, with a Note

<P>The wor&s;t of all was, that the&s;e menaces pro|ved

not &s;o much from any inclinations he had for his

his forces to advance into the Territories of

<P><HI>Archilla,</HI> dreading the indignation of the Chan,

not &s;ome of the&s;e <HI>Banjans,</HI> but in the Province of
<HI>Guzuratte</HI> they are more numerous than in other
places, and are di&s;tingui&s;h'd, e&s;pecially from tho&s;e
that profe&s;s <HI>Mahometi&s;m,</HI> by their Habit.</P>
<P>For tho' they do not ware their Hair very long,
yet do they not &s;have their Heads.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Ban|jans</HI> de&s;cri|b&egrave;d.</NOTE> Their Women
don't cover their Faces, as tho&s;e of the <HI>Mahometans</HI>
do; they ware Pendants, and Pearls in their Ears,
and Necklaces about their Necks. Black Teeth
are among&s;t them as well as in <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> in great re|que&s;t,
from whence it comes that they nick Name
the <HI>Europeans,</HI> who have white Teeth, <HI>Bondra,</HI> that
is, <HI>Apes.</HI> They ware no Breeches as the other <HI>In|dians,</HI>
but only a piece of thin Silk &s;tuff, which
is wrapt about them, reaching down to their Hams,
over which they ware their Smocks, and on them
their upper Garment, which they tie with a Girdle
<PB N="225" REF="253">
at the Wa&s;te: Some of them wear under the&s;e a
kind of narrow Wa&s;tcoats, the Sleeves whereof
reach no further than the Elbow, being naked from
the Brea&s;ts down to the Navel. They wear Shooes
either of Wood, Velvet, Brocade, or gilt
Leather, fa&s;tned with Straps to their Feet, which
they put off when they go into any Room, where
the Floor commonly is covered with Tape&s;try.</P>
<P>They are incomparably more Ingenious, Subtle,
and more Civil, than any of the other <HI>Indians.</HI> No
People in the World are more given to Writing and
ca&s;ting Accounts than they, and their Conver&s;ation
is very delightful. There is no Trade in the Great
<HI>Turk</HI>'s Country, which is not chiefly managed by
them, nor any Commodity throughout all the <HI>In|dies,</HI>
which they do not &s;ell, unle&s;s it be Fle&s;h and Fi&s;h,
or any other Thing that had Life, which they are
bound to pre&s;erve by the Rules of their Religion,
as we &s;hall relate anon.</P>
<P>They Marry their Children at 7, 8, 9, or 10
Years of Age, and it &s;eldom appears that they &s;tay
till 12, e&s;pecially if they be Daughters; for if they
&s;hould exceed that time, it would be looked upon
as Scandalous.</P>
<P>The <HI>Banyan</HI> Widows are not permitted to Marry
a &s;econd time, even though the Bridegroom &s;hould
Die before the Con&s;ummation of the Marriage; but
all the Ornaments are to be taken from her, and her
Hair to be cut of immediately after the Husband's
Death. Neverthele&s;s they are not obliged to burn
them&s;elves with the Dead Bodies of their Husbands,
neither are they hindred to do it if they have an
inclination thereto. Tho&s;e Widows in <HI>India,</HI> who
cannot di&s;pen&s;e with a &s;ingle Life, get in among
the Dancers of that Sex, where they have &s;ufficient
opportunity to exerci&s;e the Fle&s;h, and to allay the
heat which mu&s;t needs be occa&s;ioned in Vigorous
Bodies lying in &s;o hot a Climate.</P>
<P>This Barbarous Cu&s;tom for the Widows to burn
them&s;elves with their decea&s;ed Husbands, was fir&s;t
introduced into tho&s;e parts upon a Political account
<PB N="226" REF="254">
For <HI>Polygamy</HI> cau&s;ing abundance of Heart burning
and Jealou&s;ie among the Women that were Rivals
in their Husbands Affections, it often happen'd,
that &s;uch as thought them&s;elves neglected, u&s;ed fre|quently
to procure their Husbands Deaths. Where|fore
to make them to be more careful of their Hu&s;|bands
Lives, it was ordered, that &s;uch as were de|&s;irous
to be accounted hone&s;t Women, &s;hould be
engaged to keep their Husbands company in their
Journey to the other World, and be burnt together
with their Bodies. So that tho' this obligation of
dying with their Husbands was only impo&s;ed upon
&s;uch Women as &s;tood upon the reputation of their
Hone&s;ty, without any puni&s;hment to be inflicted
on &s;uch as refu&s;ed to conform them&s;elves to &s;o
dreadful a Cu&s;tom, unle&s;s they were not admitted
into the Company of Per&s;ons of Quality, as being
looked upon as Infamous; yet has this principle of
Honour been &s;o prevailing upon a va&s;t number of
the <HI>Indian</HI> Women, that there are innumerable ex|amples,
of &s;uch as have &s;acrificed their Lives upon
the Pile which burnt the dead Carca&s;&s;es of their
Husbands.</P>
<P>But as among all the Sects of the <HI>Indians,</HI> there
have been Women, who, with the &s;ame chearfulne&s;s
have thrown away their Lives to the memory of
their Husbands, as tho&s;e of the Sect of <HI>Samarath,</HI>
who&s;e Per&s;wa&s;ion is, that if a Woman hath &s;o great
an Affection for her Husband; as to burn her &s;elf
with him after his Death, &s;he &s;hall live with him in
the other World &s;even times as long, and &s;hall en|joy
him with &s;even times as much &s;atisfaction as &s;he
has done in this; it is mo&s;t probable, that they are
induced to this re&s;olution, not altogether by the mo|tive
of a Punctillo of Honour, but look on this
kind of Death as a Pa&s;&s;age, thro' which they are
to enter into a beatitude of the&s;e Plea&s;ures, where|of
they had but a &s;mall &s;hare in this World.</P>
<P>But to return to our <HI>Banyans,</HI> who having a con|&s;iderable
&s;hare in the <HI>Indian</HI> Trade in <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> very
well de&s;erve our particular de&s;cription here.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="254">
The <HI>Banyans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion of the <HI>Ban|yans.</HI></NOTE> therefore, are <HI>Pagans,</HI> u&s;ing neither
Bapti&s;m nor Circumci&s;ion; yet they believe that
there is but one God, Creator and Pre&s;erver of the
Univer&s;e. Neither does this per&s;wa&s;ion hinder it,
that they acknowledge one <HI>Braman,</HI> who they &s;ay,
is God's Vicegerent, (as they call the great God of
all the other Gods <HI>Etvara)</HI> and out of who's Brains,
they &s;ay, their <HI>Bramans,</HI> or Prie&s;ts derive their fir&s;t
Being. They are highly re&s;pected among the <HI>Ban|yans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Their</HI> Bra|mens.</NOTE>
as well as the other Pagans in <HI>India,</HI> not only
upon the account of their au&s;terity of Life, and
their extraordinary Ab&s;tinence, they fa&s;ting &s;ome|times
&s;everal Days together, &s;carce eating any
thing at all, but al&s;o in regard the Education
of the Youth is committed to their care, and that
they expound the my&s;teries of their Religion to the
ignorant People; &s;o that making what impre&s;&s;ion
they think mo&s;t convenient for their purpo&s;e, on the
minds of the &s;uper&s;titious <HI>Indians,</HI> their Words are
con&s;idered as Oracles; from whence it comes, that
the <HI>Banyans</HI> &s;eldom engage in any bu&s;ine&s;s of con|&s;equence,
unle&s;s with the Advice and Approbation
of the <HI>Braman.</HI></P>
<P>They are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the other <HI>Banyans,</HI>
only by what they wear upon their Heads, which
is a certain Head-dre&s;s made of Linnen Cloth,
wrapt &s;everal times round the Head, to cover their
Sacred Hair, which is never cut. Be&s;ides which,
they wear three pieces of &s;mall Packthread next
their Skin, which comes cro&s;s over the Brea&s;t from
the Shoulder to the Wa&s;t, which Packthreads they
never pull of, tho' it were to &s;ave their Lives.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>Malataps,</HI> they are looked upon as &s;o
Holy, that no Marriage is contracted there, but
the fir&s;t Fruits of the Bride mu&s;t be Con&s;ecrated to
the <HI>Braman,</HI> to whom &s;he is brought to be deflour'd,
and being thus purified in her lower parts, the
Bridegroom may enter without danger. For the
cunning Prie&s;ts have cajoled the poor &s;imple People
into a belief, that the Marriage could never be &s;uf|ficiently
Ble&s;&s;ed, unle&s;s the <HI>Braman</HI> has initiated the
<PB N="228" REF="255">
Bride with a Sanctifying touch. From whence it
comes, that many times he mu&s;t be very earne&s;tly
intreated, before he will undertake the Task; and
if the Per&s;ons be of any Quality or good Sub&s;tance,
he will &s;carce be engaged to take of the drudgery
from the Bridegroom's Hands, unle&s;s he be hire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
to the Work, and have a good reward for his Pains.</P>
<P>Thus the crafty Prie&s;t, by impo&s;ing upon the
&s;implicity of his Flock, improves his natural Tal|lent
to his utmo&s;t Advantage, &s;atisfies at one &s;troak
both his Appetite and Pur&s;e, and fells his Benevo|lence
at an exce&s;&s;ive price, which a Layman would
be glad to be&s;tow generou&s;ly, for nothing. But
this is not all, for if the Prie&s;t once gets &s;ure foot|ing
in a good place, he is &s;ure not to part with it
at an ea&s;ie rate, but remains a &s;tanding Friend to the
Family; for the Married Men retain &s;o much kind|ne&s;s
ever after for their Copartners, that, if they
go any Journey, or upon any occa&s;ion are de|tained
from Home, they recommend their whole Fa|mily
(but e&s;pecially their Wives) to the care of
the <HI>Braman,</HI> while they are ab&s;ent, to &s;upply their
places with them, till they return, which you may
be &s;ure the Prie&s;t will perform to the utmo&s;t of his
Power, unle&s;s the good Woman happen to be very
old or ugly, or he be di&s;abled to do his Office
by his long fa&s;ting, in which ca&s;e it is the
Womans bu&s;ine&s;s to cheri&s;h the Father's langui&s;h|ing
Spirits, with powerful Re&s;toratives, at which
the <HI>Indian</HI> Women are the mo&s;t expert in the
whole World, as they are very skilful to &s;end their
Husbands upon certain occa&s;ions, to the enjoy|ments
of the other World.</P>
<P>But to return to the more &s;erious part of their Re|ligion;
they hold the immortallity of the Soul, but
believe, withal, that at its departure out of the fir&s;t
Body, it tran&s;migrates into that of &s;ome other Crea|ture.
Thus they affirm, that by example, the Soul
of a good natur'd and meek Per&s;on, is tran&s;lated in|to
the Body of a Pidgeon or Chicken; that of a
Cruel and Rapacious Fellow into a Crocodile, a
<PB N="229" REF="255">
Lyon, or a Tyger; that of a Cunning and Crafty
Man, into that of a Fox, That of a Glutton into
the body of Swine; that of a Treacherous and Ma|licious
Per&s;on into a Serpent, before they are admit|ted
to the enjoyment of Spiritual Beatitude. For
which rea&s;on it is the <HI>Banyans</HI> ab&s;tain as we men|tioned
before, from killing any living Creatures, e|ven
to the In&s;ects, be they never &s;o trouble&s;ome or
dangerous. Nay they Act with &s;o much Circum|&s;pection
in regard of all Living Creatures, of what
kind &s;oever, that they forbear keeping any fire, and
lighting of Candles, in the Night time, out of fear,
that the Flies or Moths &s;hould chance to burn them|&s;elves
therein; they &s;carce can be induced to make
any Pits in the ground, for fear of drowning the
Slegs and other In&s;ects.</P>
<P>If the Mahometans among them do &s;ell any Birds,
they will be &s;ure to redeem them, if po&s;&s;ibly they
can, and feed them well, becau&s;e, &s;ay they, we
don't know, how &s;oon our &s;elves may &s;tand in need
of the &s;ame kindne&s;s; and they will Erect Ho&s;pi|tals
for Bea&s;ts that are Hurt or Wounded.</P>
<P>They have a more then ordinary re&s;pect for
Cows, &s;o that if they know of any one that is to
be killed for the Market, they will not only pur|cha&s;e
and redeem it at a high rate from the &s;laugh|ter;
but there is &s;carce a family, but what breeds
up one, almo&s;t as tenderly as their own Children;
For they will comb and feed it, and lodge it as
cleanly, and as carefully as if it were one of their
be&s;t Friends or Relations.</P>
<P>They never eat but in private, and before they
touch the Victuals, they throw &s;ome &s;mall quantity
of it &s;eparately into the Fire, the Water, the Air,
and upon the Earth. They have abundance of o|ther
pretended niceties, too many to be in&s;erted
here; but it ought not to be pa&s;&s;ed by in &s;ilence,
that tho' they acknowledge one Supream God,
they neverthele&s;s wor&s;hip the Devil, alledging for
a rea&s;on, that God having created him to govern
<PB N="230" REF="256">
the World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They wor|&s;hip the Devil.</NOTE> and to do hurt to Mankind, he ought
to be appea&s;ed by Prayers and Sacrifices.</P>
<P>From whence it is, that his Statues of Gold,
Silver, Ivory, Ebony, Marble, Wood or Stone are
every where to be &s;een in their Mo&s;ques, the fi|gure
of which appears mo&s;t dreadful to the eyes
of the Beholders. For his Head, out of which
come forth four Horns is adorn'd with a triple
Crown in the &s;hape of a Taira. His Face re&s;em|bles
that of a large Boar, with two great Teeth
coming out of his Mouth; and a great ugly.
Beard on his Chin. He bends his Brea&s;t to his Bel|ly,
where the Hands hang down negligently. Be|twixt
his Thighs there appears another Head with
two Horns upon it, as ugly as the fir&s;t, thru&s;ting out
of the Mouth, a Tongue of extraordinary bigne&s;s.
In&s;tead of Teeth it hath Saws, and a Cows Tail
behind. This Figure &s;tands always upon a Stone
Table, this being the Altar where the offerings are
to to be made. They have no other light in their
Mo&s;que, than what they are furni&s;h'd withall by
the Lamps which are kept burning perpetually
near the Idol: And after the Prie&s;t has fini&s;hed
his Devotious, he purifies his Head, by putting
it into the&s;e Flames, as the other <HI>Banyans</HI> pu|rifie
them&s;elves before the Sacrifice, by wa&s;hing in
a Trough, which always &s;tands on the right &s;ide
of the Altar.</P>

growing &s;ome Years, when the &s;ea&s;on proves kind,
Six or Seven foot high, with a flower like that that
of a Thi&s;tle, and the &s;eed altogether like Fenu|greek.
It is &s;eldom &s;own till in <HI>June,</HI> and is ready
to be cut towards towards the latter end of <HI>Novem|ber,</HI>
or the beginning of <HI>December.</HI> They Sow it
but once in three Years, but the fir&s;t year produces
the be&s;t, when the leaves are cut off within a foot
of the ground. The Stalks are thrown away as 
u&s;ele&s;s, and the leaves laid a drying in the Sun&punc;
which done they are put a put a &s;oaking for four
or five days in a Stone Trough, the Water with
the leaves is often &s;tirred, till &s;uch time that the
Water has &s;ufficiently extracted the whole tincture
of the Herb. Then the Water is &s;moothly drawn
off into another Stone Trough, in order to let it
&s;ettle for one night. The next day, all the Wa|ter
is again drawn off to the &s;ettlement, and what,
is thus left in the bottom of the Troughs, is &s;train|ed
through a cour&s;e Cloth, and &s;o &s;et a drying in
the Sun.</P>
<P>And this is true Indigo, which however the <HI>Ban|yans</HI>
frequently adulterate; by mixing with it a cer|tain
Earth of the &s;ame Colour. And becau&s;e the
excellency of this Commodity is judged by its light|ne&s;s,
they have cunning enough to add to it &s;ome
oyl, to make it &s;wim upon the Water. The &s;econd
year, the Stalk which was left in the ground the
year before, &s;hoots forth other leaves, but they are
not comparable to tho&s;e of the fir&s;t, tho' they much
exceed the Wild Indigo. Wherefore they re&s;erve
the greate&s;t part of the &s;econd Years product for
Seed. That of the third Year, is as much infe|rsour
