<HEAD>An Exact RELATION of the mo&s;t Remark|able Tran&s;actions that happened lately in <HI>IRELAND.</HI> With an Account of a great Sea-Fight between the <HI>ENGLISH</HI> and <HI>FRENCH</HI> Fleets.</HEAD>
<HEADNOTE>
<P>Licen&s;ed and Entered according to Order.</P>
</HEADNOTE>
<P>THE late King <HI>James,</HI> or rather the <HI>French</HI> King <HI>Lewis</HI> having got into their hands all the Towns and Ports in <HI>Ireland, Lon|don-Derry,</HI> and <HI>Inniskilling</HI> excepted, and by that means &s;topt all Opportunities of Corre&s;pon|dence, by the former Methods, we have no Advices thence, but what either come by way of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or el&s;e by Per&s;ons who make their e&s;cape by Sea hither, as frequently &s;ome do even in <HI>Gabbards, viz.</HI> an o|pen Ve&s;&s;el not unlike our Lighters on the <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>Divers of which have arrived near <HI>Che&s;ter, Liver|pool,</HI> and in the We&s;t of <HI>Stotland,</HI> one of which late|ly arrived with 80 Pa&s;&s;engers, who came from <HI>Lon|don-Derry,</HI> and &s;ay that garri&s;on had made offers of Surrendring to the late King, on Conditions to car|ry off their Baggage, and have their Lives, which was at fir&s;t accepted of; but Mon&s;ieur <HI>D'Aveaux.</HI> who pre&s;ides in all Councils, would not con&s;ent, al|ledging, That &s;ort of proceeding was not the way to arrive at the Conque&s;t that mu&s;t be made in that Kingdom, which hath &s;o exa&s;perated and defperated the Garri&s;on, as to re&s;olve to hearken to no Condi|tions, but &s;tand it out to the la&s;t Man, or until it &s;hall plea&s;e God to give Opportunity for their being reinforced with &s;uch &s;ufficient help as to be enabled to take the Field.</P>
<P>Our la&s;t Advices thence &s;ay, they are Be&s;ieged by a great Army, but have 7000 Fighting Men in Gar|ri&s;on, Arms, Amunition, and Provi&s;ions for two Months, and doubt not of holding it, having in three Sallies killed many of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> and a|mong&s;t the latter a General Officer, and it is be|lieved e're this, that Major-General <HI>Kirk,</HI> Sir <HI>John Trelawney,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Hanmore,</HI> with their Regi|ments, and the Regiment, late Col. <HI>Edgworth</HI>'s, now the Earl of <HI>Meath</HI>'s, are got &s;afe into <HI>Derry.</HI></P>
<P>On Monday arrived at <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> Col. St. <HI>George,</HI> to Command the Regiment late Col. <HI>Richards,</HI> (a Ser|jent of which for de&s;erting did &s;uffer Death the <HI>7th</HI> In&s;tant at <HI>Che&s;ter</HI>) and al&s;o Collonel <HI>Stewart</HI> to Com|mand the Regiment, late Col. <HI>Cunningham</HI>'s now at <HI>Liverpool,</HI> and the &s;ame day went po&s;t for <HI>London,</HI> the Collonels that formerly Commanded them.</P>
<P>The Garri&s;on of <HI>London-Derry</HI> having (for what Cau&s;e not yet known) a Jealou&s;ie that Col. <HI>Lundee</HI> their Governour was guilty of &s;ome De&s;igns upon them, they confined him, and cho&s;e another as you have heard; but their Rage continuing, and fearing every day to be hang'd, he found means to make his e&s;cape in a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el, which putting in at <HI>Grenoch</HI> in the We&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and being there known, and the Circum&s;tances he was under, the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;ecured him, and &s;ent him Pri&s;oner to <HI>Dum|britton</HI> Ca&s;tle, whence on the &s;econd In&s;tant he was brought to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and will there be Examined, Puni&s;hed, or Acquitted.</P>
<P>The brave Lord <HI>Kingston,</HI> Col. <HI>Buchan,</HI> and di|vers Per&s;ons of Quality are arrived from the North of <HI>Ireland</HI> to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and thence gone for <HI>England,</HI> to wait on the King: Some of the&s;e Gentle|men &s;ay, that the pre&s;ent State of the Prote&s;tants is &s;carce conceiveable, being &s;urrounded with all &s;orts of Mi&s;eries, and labouring under all the Nece&s;&s;ities of Humane Life, and the daily fears of Death by Barbarous hands, having no vi&s;ible deliverance un|der God, but from <HI>England:</HI> The&s;e worthy Per&s;ons kept together, and in divers Skirmi&s;hes killed many of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> and defended their Families, Neighbours, and Friends, until Powder, Ball, and Provi&s;ions failed, and the Enemy &s;o far advanced, that they could not retreat &s;o far as <HI>Derry,</HI> but Embarqued for <HI>Scotland,</HI> fir&s;t killing all their fine Hor&s;es, to prevent them falling into the Papi&s;ts hands, Who give out, That when they have received their further Succours from <HI>France,</HI> and reduced to Obe|dience, the Heretical Rebels in <HI>London-Derry,</HI> and in <HI>Inniskilling,</HI> they are to march further North|ward, and Embarque for <HI>Scotland:</HI> But by the U|nanimous Zeal of the Convention and People of that Ancient Kingdom, their Expectation and Depen|dance hath deceived them, mo&s;t of the Chiefs of <HI>Clanns</HI> or <HI>Tribes</HI> have freely offered their Service for the King and E&s;tates, and the re&s;t Cited to give the Bond of Peace for them&s;elves and Va&s;&s;als: Nay, the Vi&s;count of <HI>Dundee</HI> who hath with about 200 Hor&s;e rode the length of <HI>Murray</HI> in the North, and among&s;t the Duke of <HI>Gordon</HI>'s, and other of the Highland <HI>Clanns</HI> cannot get any to obey his Commands, or by Per&s;wa&s;ion engage any Gentleman to joyn with him, no not the Papi&s;t <HI>Highlanders;</HI> and &s;uch have been the Zeal and di&s;patch of the Convention, that all the Militia both Officers and Souldiers are &s;etled, and all good Prote&s;tants: And above all this, the Lord <HI>Neile Campbell,</HI> Sir <HI>Hugh Campbell</HI> of <HI>Caddell,</HI> and all the Nobility, Lords, and Lairds, who&s;e Territories are in any Danger from an <HI>Iri&s;h French</HI> Inva&s;ion, have applied to the Convention with Offers of rai&s;ing and heading many Regiments without Charge to the Publick, which is accepted, and Powers given them &s;o to do, and all the Militia put into Prote&s;tants Hands: So that it's believed an Army of 20000 Hor&s;e and Foot will &s;ooner be in the North of <HI>Ire|land</HI> from <HI>Scotland,</HI> than <HI>Scotland</HI> invaded by the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Army, who&s;e very Names are be|come more odious then &s;eared by the <HI>Brati&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> Fleet having in <HI>March</HI> la&s;t Tran&s;port|ed the late King into <HI>Ireland,</HI> returned back to <HI>Bre&s;t,</HI> where they have lain ever &s;ince, and being increa&s;ed unto near Forty Sail of all &s;orts.</P>
<P>On Friday Morning, <HI>April</HI> the 26th &s;et Sail a|gain for <HI>Ireland,</HI> having on Board many Land-men, a great Sum of Money, Arms, and Ammunition, &s;teering for <HI>King&s;ale,</HI> and were met on Monday the 29th at eight at Night, &s;even Leagues We&s;tward
<PB N="2" REF="2" MS="y">of the Cape of <HI>Ireland</HI> near the Shore, the Wind at Ea&s;t, by Mr. <HI>Andrew Hopkins</HI> Commander of the <HI>Adven|ture</HI> of <HI>Byddiford,</HI> homewards bound from <HI>Mary-Land</HI> with Tobacco, who &s;ays they were in all 37 Sail, whereof 20 Capital Ships, 8 Fire-Ships, the re&s;t Tenders, and Fly-Boats with Souldiers, one of them made Sail after <HI>Hopkins,</HI> who braced to his Sails, and &s;taid for him, but the <HI>French</HI> Admiral fireing a Gun the Frigat left the per&s;uite, and borne up to the Fleet, who made but a &s;lack Sail, mo&s;t of them having their Top-Sails on the Cap, and all in a Line in a fighting po&s;ture, and believes they were de&s;igned for the North of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>On Tue&s;day about eight in the Morning, <HI>April</HI> the 30th, Mr. <HI>Hopkins</HI> met one of Admiral <HI>Herbert</HI>'s Scouts who commanded him on Board, and after|wards went to the Admiral, and gave him a de|&s;cription of the <HI>French</HI> Fleet, and that they were then about to Leagues to Leeward of our Fleet, upon which the Sea-men gave a very great Shout, and made all preparations to engage them, making al&s;o all the Sail they could: Our Fleet con&s;i&s;ted of 26 Sail without the Fire-Ships who were left in <HI>Milford</HI> Haven, being very Leaky; when Mr. <HI>Hopkins</HI> left our Fleet, &s;ome of his Men from the Top-ma&s;t head di&s;covered 8 Sail which he believed were part of the &s;aid <HI>French</HI> Fleet, and that our Fleet met them that Evening; and further &s;ays, the <HI>French</HI> could not Land their Men, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> thereabouts.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day la&s;t the <HI>Mary,</HI> Captain <HI>Matthew Aylmer</HI> Commander, came to the <HI>Spithead,</HI> and came a&s;hore at <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> whence he immediately took Po&s;t for the Court, to give his Maje&s;ty an ac|count of the Engagement that en&s;ued on Wedne&s;day <HI>May</HI> the fir&s;t, as Follows; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Admiral finding them on Tue&s;day Night got all into the Bay of <HI>Bantrey,</HI> lay by all Night, and next Morn|ing by break of Day &s;tood in upon them, and with 8 or 9 Sail made a de&s;perate Fight again&s;t 28 Sail of the <HI>French,</HI> and five Fire-Ships, with all the di&s;ad|vantages imaginable, the Enemy having the Wind, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> not able to make u&s;e of their lower Tyre of Guns, yet neverthele&s;s maintain'd the Fight for many hours, and at five at Night &s;tood off to Sea, and the <HI>French</HI> at the &s;ame time tacking from them, by which it's gue&s;&s;ed they have received great lo&s;s of Men, and damage in their Ships, and had not then Landed either Men, Money, Arms, or Ammunition; which two rea&s;ons may be given for; the one, that they pur&s;ued not the Advantage they had by Num|bers and Wind; or el&s;e according to their con&s;tant practice by Land and Sea, not to hazard Men or Ships without inevitable Nece&s;&s;ity; their work then being to Land Succours, not fight.</P>
<P>Letters of the third In&s;tant from our Fleet &s;ay, the <HI>French</HI> were in the Bay, &s;o near the Shore, that they could not get to Windward of them, that five of their Capital Ships were at one time upon the <HI>Eliza|beth,</HI> Admiral <HI>Herbert</HI>'s Ship, and the <HI>Pendennis,</HI> Capt. <HI>Cloud&s;ly Shovel</HI>'s Ship, but cleared them&s;elves brave|ly; the Admiral is much damaged in his Sails and Rigging, and lo&s;t 20 or 30 Men, the <HI>Pendennis</HI> not &s;o many, Captain <HI>A&s;hby</HI> in the <HI>Edgar</HI> 60 or 70, Cap|tain <HI>Aylmer</HI> in the <HI>Portland</HI> is killed, and 14 or 15 of his Men.</P>
<P>They have &s;unk two of the <HI>French</HI> Capital Ships and killed many of their Men, that five of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships chiefly bore four hours hot Engagement, the reit not being able to come up to them.</P>
<P>Letters from <HI>Exon</HI> of the 8th In&s;tant &s;ay, Admi|ral <HI>Herbert</HI> is come into <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and that they have &s;unk the <HI>French Admiral,</HI> and one more, and that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are refitting their Sails, and Rig|ging, in which they &s;uffered the mo&s;t Damage.</P>
<P>Letters from <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> of the 8th In&s;tant &s;ay, the Advice-Boat with an Expre&s;s from the King to <HI>Lon|don-Derry</HI> that went off from <HI>Liverpool</HI> the 30th pa&s;t, is come back, and gives account that the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Coa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">t was full of Souldiers, but however with &s;ome diffi|culty, by help of a Man of War ent in the Expre&s;s, which when received by direction, they were to give three Huzzaes, which they did, and made great re|joycing for it, drinking their Maje&s;ties Healths in Spring Water; and it's &s;aid have a&s;&s;ured the King by Expre&s;s back, they will hold out to the la&s;t, and want neither Ammunition nor Provi&s;ions, and in three late Sallies on the Be&s;iegers, have killed 400, and retreated each time with little lo&s;s.</P>
<P>And this Week is come to Town one Mr. <HI>Web</HI> a mo&s;t worthy, Grave, and Reverend Divine, who is Mini&s;ter of <HI>Inniskilling</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> who having Pro|claimed King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and pub|lickly Prayed for them, enraged the Papi&s;ts to that height, that the Lord <HI>Galmoy</HI> at the head of &s;ome thou&s;ands of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> were drawing towards the place, threatning to hang up the &s;aid Mini&s;ter higher than <HI>Haman</HI> was, and to put the re&s;t to the Sword. But they fear him not, having 2000 Men well Armed in the place, and Ammunition and Provi&s;ions for &s;ome Months, yet &s;uch was their re&s;pect and ten|derne&s;s to this worthy Divine, that they even &s;or|ced him to withdraw, lea&s;t time and Accidents might force them to Surrender into the hands of tho&s;e who would have no Mercy on him; &s;o he e&s;caped to <HI>London-Derry,</HI> and there got ten Barrels of Pow|der to be &s;ent to <HI>Inniskilling.</HI></P>
<P>Since the arrival of Captain <HI>Aylmer</HI> (Brother to the late Captain <HI>Aylmer</HI> that was kill'd in the Fight) who brought the Account to the King of the Engage|ment, divers Letters are come, which confirm the former Relations, and &s;ome with this Addition, That the next day after the Fight they took two &s;mall <HI>French</HI> Ve&s;&s;els, who were making homewards with Advice of the Action: The Pri&s;oners do declare, that their Admiral was killed, and two of their Capital Ships &s;unk, 12 di&s;abled, and a great number of their Men killed and wounded, and that they all highly applaud the Courage of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Sea-men, and bravery of their Commanders. Admiral <HI>Herbert</HI> is certainly come into <HI>Plymouth,</HI> much di&s;abled, and the other di&s;abled Ships into <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> where all hands are put to refit them, to joyn the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, which are pa&s;&s;ed We&s;tward, con&s;i&s;ting of 28 Sail of Capital Ships, 10 Fire-&s;hips, and &s;ome Tenders.</P>
