<PB N="2" REF="7">their numerous Progeny &s;o multipli'd, that they were forc'd to Plant fre&s;h Colonies, &s;till more and more remote from the Foot of the Mountain where they fir&s;t &s;ettled. But nothing more help'd to the well and equal re-peo|pling of the de&s;olated Univer&s;e, than the confu&s;ion of Tongues, which hap|pen'd in the Worlds Infancy at <HI>Babel,</HI> where all the Children of that Genera|tion re&s;olving to &s;ettle, not minding farther Di&s;coveries, pitch'd upon the fertile Plains of <HI>Shinar;</HI> Here mu&s;t be (&s;ay they) the Center of our growing and intended Empire; this our begun, this our &s;tupendious Work, who&s;e a&s;pi|ring Tower looks down already upon the Clouds, and hereafter threatens to &s;cale the Skies, &s;hall be the mighty, and all-commanding Head of our Impe|rial City, which extended over the&s;e Plains, we will inhabit, and with our Lives and Fortunes guard and maintain. But they in their vain De&s;ign and pre&s;umptuous Project, were &s;uddenly baffled by Divine Providence, who in &s;tead of &s;etling, &s;catter'd them over the face of the Earth: for when they were at the bu&s;ie&s;t, and in the heighth of their expectation, labouring to fini&s;h this marvellous Structure, thus the Almighty di&s;appointed their whole endeavours, all Tasks were &s;uddenly thrown a&s;ide, each mi&s;taking, not under&s;tanding one another; in which confu&s;ion their onely comfort was, to meet with any that &s;pake with them the &s;ame Language: The&s;e u&s;ing one Tongue, gathering in a Body, &s;tuck together, and in &s;everal Companies fled to &s;trange and unpeopl'd Regions; where Planting they flouri&s;h'd, and &s;uddenly grew up to be &s;everal great Kingdoms.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Since call'd <HI>Europe, A&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> the then onely known Countrey.</NOTE> So this their total rout, and flying to all the Angles of the Univer&s;e, proved for the better, each by this means being &s;ooner &s;uppli'd; &s;o extending by degrees their fre&s;h Colonies to the utmo&s;t and Maritime Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Yet however, one Party after this di&s;&s;olution remaining &s;till upon the Spot, which though they utterly &s;leighted their begun Tower, leaving it to ruine and decay, yet went on chearfully with their chief City; where <HI>Nimrod</HI> fir&s;t taking the Title and &s;upreme Authority upon him, &s;at in his new erected Throne, fir&s;t Monarch of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> Empire. Be&s;ides him, many ab&s;olute Princes were thus in proce&s;s of time e&s;tabli&s;h'd in their &s;everal Dominions, and the whole World &s;eem'd to be once more totally repleni&s;h'd.</P>
<P>When the re&s;tle&s;s Nature of Man, either un&s;atisfi'd with what he hath at|chiev'd, or &s;purr'd on by ambition, or urgent nece&s;&s;ity, to enlarge their Bounds for their &s;upernumerary Swarms, gave the beginning to the Iron, or turbu|lent Age, War and Ho&s;tility raging every where, in which tho&s;e prevailing, grew high and mighty, tho&s;e conquer'd, low and humble, continual vici&s;&s;i|tudes and fluctuations of People, Kingdoms &s;ubverted in Republicks, and Common-wealths, weary of &s;uch Government, turn'd again into Monarchies. The weake&s;t Party, put to all extremities, and wor&s;t of exigencies by the pur|&s;uing Enemy, were enforc'd, all Land deni'd them, venturing for refuge into the wide Ocean, were &s;oon &s;wallow'd up; &s;ome driven they knew not whi|ther, lighted on uninhabited Countreys, there beginning new Plantations, and perhaps, by &s;uch Fugitives the new World never heard of by antiquity, became of old to be peopled, and by that means grown &s;ince to &s;uch va&s;t Empires, as our late Voyagers have di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>Here it will not &s;eem ami&s;s to give you an account, according as all Writers have it, how this our Old World was peopled, <HI>viz. A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> and who were the Fathers, or chief Captains, giving Denominations to the People, and &s;etling them in their &s;everal Plantations, beginning with Holy Scripture.</P>

<P>But the <HI>Zamarin</HI> looking upon this as a high Affront, to be force'd thus to his di&s;honor to exchange Goods for Pri&s;oners, and to be brought to Capitula|tions, onely three Ships oppo&s;ing his Mighty and Ab&s;olute Power; would not thus &s;it down, nor take it &s;o; although his own Navy, by which, nay, with a &s;mall part, he might have vindicated his Cau&s;e, which were there then, by rea&s;on of the Annual Tempe&s;ts hall'd a&s;hore, and could by no means po&s;&s;ible be &s;uddenly Launch'd; yet with wonderful dexterity he Mann'd out &s;ixty Boats, with &s;tout and expert Soldiers, who were &s;o Order'd and Commanded, that they were able to de&s;troy and Swallow them all.</P>

<P>After <HI>Gama</HI>'s Return, of whom the King had receiv'd &s;ufficient Information concerning the Profit and Advantage which might be made by the <HI>East-India</HI> Expeditions, did &s;o much encourage him, that he fitted out thirteen Ships, Mann'd with 1500 Mariners, and 500 Soldiers, under the Command of <HI>Pedro Alvaro Caprales,</HI> who had &s;trict Order, That he &s;hould endeavour by all means to make a League of Amity and Friend&s;hip with the Emperor of <HI>Calicut;</HI> and to reque&s;t the Liberty of Rai&s;ing a Fort there, to the end they might there &s;ettle their Staple of Merchandi&s;e: Which if the Emperor &s;hould refu&s;e, nor
<PB N="17" REF="14">would be drawn to by any Per&s;wa&s;ions, then to endeavor to force him to it by Arms.</P>
<P>Thus having receiv'd his In&s;truction and Commi&s;&s;ion, he departed with his Fleet out of the Haven of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> and Steer'd the &s;ame Cour&s;e to <HI>St. James</HI> I&s;land, as <HI>Gama</HI> had done before. Then he Sail'd more We&s;terly, and fell at la&s;t on an unknown Coa&s;t, which he call'd <HI>Holy-Cro&s;s-Land,</HI> &s;ince <HI>Brafile;</HI> where Landing, and finding it a fruitful and rich Soil, he ca&s;t up a Fort, and &s;ent <HI>Gaspar Lemius</HI> back to <HI>Portugal,</HI> to inform King <HI>Emanuel</HI> of his New Di&s;covery. And leaving the Charge of the New Work which he made there; to &s;ome choice Men that he took put of the Fleet, with all Nece&s;&s;aries to maintain it, he departed, directing his Cour&s;e towards <HI>Calicut.</HI></P>
<P>But in the way he rancountred with &s;uch Storms, that he lo&s;t four of his Ve&s;&s;els; and glad he came off with no greater damage, Steer'd directly for <HI>Cali|cut,</HI> where &s;oon after he arriv'd.</P>
<P>Where the <HI>Zamarin</HI> dealing al&s;o treacherou&s;ly with him, they fell at vari|ance; but <HI>Caprales</HI> play'd his Game &s;o well, that he forc'd the <HI>Zamarin</HI> to pay him double the damage of what his Lo&s;&s;es came to: So returning with mean Succe&s;s, he arriv'd in the Haven of <HI>Lisbon, Anno</HI> 1501.</P>
<P>The &s;ame year <HI>Emanuel</HI> plying his Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;et forth three other Ships, under <HI>Johannes Novius;</HI> who meeting with <HI>Caprales,</HI> now in his way homeward, telling him of the fickle and treacherous behavior of the <HI>Zamarin</HI> of <HI>Calicut,</HI> quite di&s;|courag'd, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch his Labor would prove in vain, return'd with him: So that that Expedition &s;ignified nothing.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e Rubs and Di&s;couragements, his being &s;till more and more out of Pur&s;e, and all his Endeavors turning to no account, but only feeding as it were vain Hopes; yet not one jot di&s;countenanc'd, he went on &s;trenuou&s;ly, and &s;et out the year following a &s;econd time <HI>Va&s;ques de Gama,</HI> with ten Ships, conceiving by his well-experienc'd Conduct, he might be more for|tunate, and might at la&s;t &s;et a better face upon the whole Affair; yet he re|turn'd with little better Succe&s;s than the former had done: But how&s;oever, the King went on, and would not be daunted, &s;etting forth <HI>Vincent So|derio,</HI> next <HI>Stephano Gama,</HI> then <HI>Alphon&s;o</HI> and <HI>Franci&s;co Albuquerque,</HI> and after <HI>Gundi&s;&s;alo Coelio,</HI> with &s;everal Fleets; all which return'd but &s;mall Audits, in lieu of his va&s;t Expences.</P>
<P>But at la&s;t, con&s;idering the whole weight of this high Concern lay only upon his Shoulders, and &s;ome few of the Nobility; his Merchants and Private Traders, and the whole Body of the People, not at all concern'd: Neither &s;eeming willing, then, or at any time, to be ingag'd, either in their Pur&s;e, or otherwi&s;e; he bethought him&s;elf (ob&s;erving the Nation to be naturally Super|&s;titious, and much inclin'd to hearken to Prophecies, and &s;uch Follies of know|ing Future Events) of a way, a &s;ubtile Artifice, to catch the whole People, or at lea&s;t the Richer &s;ort, with a new Device, or Royal Trepan, which was thus effected.</P>
<P><HI>Hermicus Cajadus,</HI> a Learned and Famous Poet of that Time, being not only witty in his Art, but ingenuous, and tru&s;ty to carry on a clo&s;e De&s;ign, King <HI>Ema|nuel</HI> privately employ'd: They contriving together, what the King dictated, the Poet &s;et down, and &s;oon after at his lea&s;ure put it in Ver&s;e, and with as cleanly Conveyance, got the whole Matter ingraven in ancient Characters, upon three Stones; which done, he buried them on the Sea-&s;hore, near <HI>Cape Rocha Decin|tra,</HI> which were there to lie till <HI>Emanuel</HI> gave the Word.

Soon the fame of this was &s;pread through all Parts thereabouts, which came at la&s;t with great wonder to the Kings Ear; but he &s;hew'd him&s;elf more amaz'd and &s;trangelier concern'd than the Relater; and very earne&s;t &s;uddenly to &s;ee and know what they might &s;ignifie, &s;traight commanded the Marbles to be brought to Court.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their remarkable and &s;trange Ceremonies u&s;ed about the Dead.</NOTE>The <HI>Roman</HI> Pride in tho&s;e Affairs, the <HI>Japanners</HI> have taken an exact Pattern by: for when a Per&s;on dies, they &s;et the Corps on a Bier, with his Head bow'd forwards, and his Hands folded together, in a praying Po&s;ture, clad in
<PB N="390" REF="239">White, over which hangs a Paper Coat, pa&s;ted together, whereon is written the Religion of that Idol whom the deceas'd honor'd and wor&s;hipp'd. In this po&s;ture four Men carry it out of the City to the Fire; then a great number of his Relations and Friends, which attended the Corps, &s;tand round about the Fire, and call a whole Hour together on the Name of the Idol, whether <HI>Amida, Xaca, Canon,</HI> or any other, to who&s;e Service in his Life-time the Departed was mo&s;t devote; whil&s;t the <HI>Bonzies</HI> play, making a horrible noi&s;e, by &s;triking on Copper Kettles and Ba&s;ons. The Pit wherein the Fire is made, is &s;quare, hung round about with Mats, and hath an Entrance that opens towards the four Winds: The Pit it &s;elf fill'd full of Wood, which is cover'd with a Sail. On both &s;ides thereof &s;tand Tables, fill'd with Meats, all dre&s;s'd in Blood, and Ve&s;&s;els fill'd with Perfumes; and next them, lie great Heaps of Sweet-wood. When the Bier with the Corps approaches, they fa&s;ten a long Rope about it, on which every one that can come near lays his Hand, and call all together on the Name of the Decea&s;ed's Idol. Thus they carry the Body three times about the Pyre, on the Shoulders of four Men: At la&s;t &s;etting the Bier with the Corps on the Pile of Wood, the chief <HI>Bonzie</HI> waves a lighted Torch three times over the dead Bodies Head; which done, he throws it away; but it is taken up again by the neare&s;t of the Decea&s;eds Relations, of which one &s;tands on the Ea&s;t, and the other on the We&s;t &s;ide of the Bier. Three times they give it from one to the other over the Corps; then they &s;et Fire on the Pile of Wood, whil&s;t others that &s;tand next to them pour Oyl and E&s;&s;ences thereon; &s;o that the Flame &s;uddenly a&s;cends the Sky, and con&s;umes the dead Body to A&s;hes.</P>
<P>Mean while, the Children and neare&s;t Relations go to the Tables, kindle the Ve&s;&s;els with Perfumes, and &s;hew Wor&s;hip to him that is burnt: Which done, every one returns home; onely the Common People that follow'd the Corps, make them&s;elves merry about the Fire, with the Meat that &s;tands on the two Tables by the Funeral Pit.</P>
<P>The next day the neare&s;t Allies return again to the Fire, and there gather the A&s;hes, Teeth, and Bones into a gilded Urn, which carrying home, they &s;et in a private Chamber, and cover with a rich Cloth.

Moreover, they gather'd up as many Pieces of the Ship as would make them a Booth to defend them from the Weather; for they knew not in what Countrey they were, how call'd, or whether inhabited or not, becau&s;e the Skie being Clouded for &s;eve|ral days, they could take no ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd day after they &s;uffer'd Shipwrack they &s;aw a Man, whom they beckning to come to them ran away; &s;oon after came three other, of which one carry'd a Mu&s;quet, the other two Bows and Arrows, which al&s;o fled from them; but one of the Sea-men running after them unarm'd, got &s;ome Fire, which they wanted extremely.

The <HI>Hollanders</HI> that remain'd in the Tent, believ'd certainly, that their Companions were put to a mi&s;erable death; but they us'd them not &s;o cruelly: for the <HI>Coreans</HI> onely put an Iron Chain about their Necks, to which a great Bell was made fa&s;t under their Chin. Then &s;ome of the Offi|cers went into the Booth, and had a great deal of Di&s;cour&s;e which the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> under&s;tood not; but they &s;ignifi'd to them that they intended to go to <HI>Japan,</HI> but &s;uffering Shipwrack they were come a&s;hore there to &s;ave them&s;elves. The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> look'd upon tho&s;e Goods which they had &s;av'd, and finding onely a little Meal, Salt-Beef and Pork, they brought &s;ome Rice boyl'd in Water, which was a great refre&s;hment. Not long continu'd their joy that they were not in a barren Countrey; for whil&s;t they were eating, a great many of the Soldiers came running towards their Tent, every one holding a Rope in his
<PB N="461" REF="282">hand, which made the <HI>Hollanders</HI> think that they &s;hould be bound and kill'd: but this fear &s;oon vani&s;h'd, when the <HI>Coreans</HI> ran with all &s;peed towards the Wreck, every one laboring to hale the Wood a&s;hore, which burning they carry'd the Iron away. In the interim the Pilot taking an ob&s;ervation, found that it was <HI>Quelpaerds-I&s;land</HI> where they had lo&s;t their Ship, and were in thirty three Degrees and thirty two Minutes Latitude. Moreover, the <HI>Coreans</HI> &s;till bu&s;ied them&s;elves in haling a&s;hore the Pieces of the Wreck, and burning it for the Iron; and la&s;tly they &s;et the whole Wreck on Fire, which might have co&s;t them dear: for two Bra&s;s-Guns deeply loaden went off, but it &s;o hapned, that the Muzzles of them lay towards the Sea: this Blow &s;truck &s;uch a fear among&s;t them, that every one fled, and coming to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> de&s;ir'd to know of them if it would do the like again; but they informing that there were no more Guns that were Charged in the Ship, they went on with their work.</P>
<P>Moreover, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> vi&s;ited the Governor of <HI>Quelpaerds-I&s;le,</HI> and pre&s;ent|ed him with a Bottle of Tent, which pleas'd him &s;o well, that he became very kind to them, &s;ending them boyl'd Rice twice a day, and bid them come and &s;ee the puni&s;hment which would be inflicted on tho&s;e that had robb'd the wreck'd Ve&s;&s;el. The Iron they had &s;tole was tied to their Backs, and they them&s;elves laid upon the Ground, receiv'd &s;everal Drubbings on the Balls of their Feet with a Stick about a Fathom long, and as thick as an ordinary Boy's Arm, &s;o beating them unmercifully.</P>

<P>&para; THe Elephant is the chief pattern of the wonderful Works of God.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Job</HI> 40. <HI>Ver&s;.</HI> 15, 16. <HI>Behemoth.</HI></NOTE> God calls him <HI>Behemoth: Behold now</HI> Behemoth <HI>which I made with thee, he eateth gra&s;s as an Ox, Lo now his &s;trength is in his loins, and his force is on the navel of his belly.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thomas Aquinas</HI> and <HI>Nicholas Lyra,</HI> following the Opinion of mo&s;t of the
<PB N="486" REF="304"><HI>Rabbins,</HI> under&s;tand that <HI>Behemoth</HI> is an Elephant, and created on the &s;ame day that Man was; and though it be a fearful Mon&s;ter, yet it is afraid of Man|kind: for he &s;atisfies him&s;elf like an Ox with what the Earth produceth, and trembles at the &s;mell of a Mans foot-&s;teps.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Elephants far exceed tho&s;e of <HI>Africa.</HI> The &s;trength of tho&s;e in <HI>India</HI> may be judg'd by the great Towers which they carry on their backs.</P>
<P>In the Wars by <HI>Antiochus Eupator</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI> every Elephant carry'd a &s;mall Tower with thirty &s;ix Soldiers, be&s;ides the <HI>Indian</HI> which guided him. That the&s;e Mon&s;ters live three hundred years <HI>Ari&s;totle, Pliny, Ambro&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Non|nus</HI> witne&s;s.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Policy of the Elephants.</NOTE>Moreover, <HI>Philo&s;tratus</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> Writer &s;aith, That the Elephant is like&s;t to Man of any Bea&s;t in Policy and Prudence: his Sence the Elephant expre&s;&s;es two ways, either by his natural Apprehen&s;ion, or by good In&s;truction: to the fir&s;t mu&s;t be reckon'd, that the Elephant rowls him&s;elf in the Mudd again&s;t the heat of the Sun; and when he goes to drink, he fir&s;t &s;tirs the Water with his Snout, that he may not &s;wallow any hurtful Creature; which is more cre|dible than what <HI>Theophilactus Simocatus</HI> &s;aith, That the Bea&s;t &s;tirs the Water be|cau&s;e he is afraid of his own Shadow. When they go to wade through any River, the younge&s;t walk before, for otherwi&s;e the old ones would &s;ink and make the Ground deeper by their weight, &s;o that the young ones could not po&s;&s;ibly get over.</P>
<P>But concerning the Apprehen&s;ions of this Bea&s;t, &s;everal credible Witne&s;&s;es give us many remarkable Examples. <HI>Seneca, Pliny,</HI> and <HI>Suetonius</HI> relate, That the Elephants in the Theatre at <HI>Rome,</HI> not onely Fenc'd with Swords, but Danc'd on the Ropes.</P>
<P><HI>Hieronimus O&s;orius</HI> relates, That <HI>Anno</HI> 1514. an <HI>Indian</HI> Elephant bow'd him|&s;elf three times to Pope <HI>Leo</HI> the tenth.</P>
<P><HI>Augerus Busbequius</HI> relates in his Emba&s;&s;y to the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Emperor, That he &s;aw a young Elephant, who ob&s;erv'd the &s;teps, and Danc'd exactly after the Time of a &s;tring'd In&s;trument, and ca&s;t a Ball backwards.</P>
<P>It de&s;erves peculiar ob&s;ervation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Epi&s;t. Lyp&s;. ad Janum. Hautanum.</NOTE> what <HI>Peter Bellon,</HI> an eye-witne&s;s, related to <HI>Carolus Clu&s;ius,</HI> who told it again to <HI>Ju&s;tus Lip&s;ius,</HI> That his Elephant coming weary and hungry into the Stable, where he found an A&s;s eating of Corn, he drove him from the Manger, and eat up what he found: but &s;oon after the Ma&s;ter of the Elephant coming into the Stable, gave him his fill of Corn; the Bea&s;t con&s;idering the wrong which hunger had made him do the A&s;s, he divided the Corn, and gave the A&s;s as much as he had taken from him.</P>
<P>This va&s;t Mon&s;ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 9.</NOTE> as we &s;aid, is very fearful of Man-kind. <HI>Pliny</HI> &s;aith, <Q>So &s;oon as the Elephant &s;pies the foot-&s;teps of a Man, though he never &s;aw one before, he is afraid of private Ambu&s;cades, and looking about him, goes not a &s;tep forwarder, but makes it known to his followers, &s;o from one to the ve|ry la&s;t; whereupon they all return.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame <HI>Pliny</HI> relates,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lib.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 5.</NOTE> That <HI>Bacchus</HI> &s;et thirty Elephants again&s;t &s;everal Pri&s;oners which he had condemn'd; but they, le&s;s be&s;tial than their Ma&s;ter, would not ob&s;erve or obey his cruel Commands: Wherefore <HI>Ptolomy Phy&s;con</HI> made the Elephants drunk when he would have the naked <HI>Jews,</HI> with their Wives to be put to death. And full as fearful they are of Stags.</P>
<P>When <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great had pa&s;t beyond the utmo&s;t bounds of the <HI>Hercu|lean Pillars</HI> and <HI>Bacchus</HI> Encamp'd his Army, tho&s;e that were &s;ent into the For|re&s;ts for Wood, came amazedly running back upon the &s;ight of a great num|ber
<PB N="487" REF="304">of Elephants coming towards their Army: at which <HI>Porus,</HI> an <HI>Indian</HI> King encourag'd <HI>Alexander,</HI> telling him, That he need not fear the lea&s;t danger, if his Troopers took but &s;ome Hogs on their Hor&s;es, and with beating com|pell them to make a noi&s;e, at which the Elephants all return'd back again into the Woods.</P>
<P>&para; BUt to return again to <HI>Malacca:</HI> This City is inhabited by <HI>Hollanders, Chine&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Malacquers.</HI> Half a Mile off at Sea lies the <HI>Red I&s;land,</HI> from whence the <HI>Hollanders</HI> took <HI>Malacca</HI> from the <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Malacquers</HI> of <HI>Queda</HI> &s;ome years &s;ince maintain'd a War again&s;t the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, but were &s;ubdu'd by force of Arms.</P>
<P><HI>Queda</HI> belongs to the Queen of <HI>Achien</HI> on <HI>Sumatra;</HI> who not long &s;ince would have Marry'd with a <HI>Hollander,</HI> but that the Councel in <HI>Batavia,</HI> for &s;everal weighty Rea&s;ons, judg'd it no way convenient.</P>

<P>Here is that famous red Wood, of which the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company, <HI>Anno</HI> 1663. made a trial.</P>
<P>The Haven before <HI>Dingding</HI> full of Fi&s;h, and very &s;afe, which they enter Ea&s;tward, and go out We&s;tward.</P>
<P>The Water which flows from the Mountains along the Valleys into the Sea, is as good as any fre&s;h Water in <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>A League We&s;tward from <HI>Dingding</HI> appear the three I&s;lands, which the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> for a certain accident call'd <HI>The Man-eaters I&s;les,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Wee&s;op</HI> and <HI>Schelling</HI> Frigats were ca&s;t away there, and the People which were &s;av'd, going a&s;hore were all &s;lain by the Inhabitants.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1661. five Ships going from <HI>Malacca</HI> to fetch their Countrey-men, found them unbury'd; whereupon they brought their Guns a&s;hore, to take revenge on the Cannibals, and built a Ship of the Pieces of the Wreck that were remaining, which was afterwards us'd at <HI>Malacca.</HI></P>

<P>This <HI>Me&s;opatam</HI> is a great City, inhabited by <HI>Moors</HI> that drive a va&s;t Trade with large Ships; the Tackle whereof is made of Trees, as we mention'd before.</P>

<P>The Ve&s;&s;els which they have there are very remarkable, and by them call'd <HI>Catamarous,</HI> being four round pieces of Wood ty'd together: he that &s;teers it &s;its with his back-&s;ide in the Water, Dabbles with his Feet, and Rows with an Oar, &s;mall in the middle, and broad at the end, which he moves to and again, &s;o making his way very fa&s;t through the Water.</P>
