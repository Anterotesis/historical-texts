<P>THough many Travellers have
written Books on this Subject,
yet I assure thee none ever
came into the world with more Au|thority
than that of this Author. He
had the general Approbation of the
Learned Travellers of <HI>France,</HI> some
whereof, (and those of most note)
were pleased publickly to testify to the
World the faithfulness and exactness of
the Author in his Descriptions, and
Delineations; so that with Monsieur
<HI>Galand,</HI> when you have your eye
<PB REF="3">
upon the Draughts in this Book, you
may fancy you see the Originals them|selves.
The King of <HI>France</HI> was so
pleased with these Draughts, that he
commanded the Author to make them
publick, and gave him his Letters
Patents, strictly forbidding any to
invade his propriety, by copying them
after him.</P>
<P>Monsieur <HI>Grelott</HI> has chiefly herein
avoided what has been often repeated
by other Travellers, and set down such
remarkable things as were omitted
by them, so that you will find many
things in this Book (besides his ex|cellent
Draughts) very worthy obser|vation,
not to be found any where else.</P>
<P>The discoursive part is very plea|sant,
as well as learned, intermingled
with many pretty stories; from which

<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>SO many Relations of the <HI>Levant</HI> have
been publish'd to the World, and the
curious have been so well satisfy'd in
what concerns that part of the Earth,
that a man does but expose him self to cen|sure,
who shall presume to believe he makes
any thing now publick that is not already
sufficiently known. So that all the modern
relations of the Eastern Travellers being no
more than repetitions, I deferr'd some years
after my return to publish what I had done,
for no other reason, than to preserve the
Ideas of the most remarkable things which I
had seen in my Travells. I observ'd in all
the Relations which I read, that the chiefest
part of the remarks which I had made, were
almost the same with what several famous
Travellers had done before me, and that
therefore I should run the hazard of being
look'd upon as a Copier, or a Plagiarie from
others. But at length finding that none of all
the numerous Relations which have appear'd
in the world have afforded so much as one
Draught or faithful Plate of what is here
describ'd, I resolv'd for the satisfaction of
several that have honour'd me with their
<PB REF="5">
friendship, to cause some of the Platforms
and Draughts which I had taken in the East
to be Engrav'd. And I make no question
but all the Figures, which make the best
part of this book, and upon which the whole
discourse is grounded, will suffice to satisfy
those who have not had the leisure or desire
to read what other Taavellers have written;
as also those who have already read in some
Relations the description of the same places,
who not being able by means of the dis|course
to apprehend the design of the Buil|ding,
would perhaps be glad to have before
their eyes the faithful Draughts of the Plat|forms,
Elevations and out-lines of all thos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
beautiful Piles, of which they have heard
such high reports. By the means of these
Plates all sorts of persons in a short time may
without hazard, and to advantage satisfy
their curiosity. They will be able to un|derstand
more of <HI>Constantinople</HI> after they
have perus'd the few leaves of this small
Volume, than from those who at a great ex|pence
of Mony and pains have in large
Folio's delivered to publick view, notions
quite contrary to truth. I do not say that
so many famous <HI>Travellers</HI> who have view'd
the East before me, and put forth so great a
number of Relations, have wanted language
or expression to embellish their Writings&punc;
They are all worthy praise for what they
<PB REF="6">
have done, nor do I believe that any Traveller
would willingly at the expence of his repu|tation
impose upon his Readers. Yet this is
certain, that large Volumes in Writing do
not always give that satisfaction to the ap|prehension,
as the draught of the same thing
faithfully and exactly made and Engrav'd,
which explains several doubts not to be
easily resolv'd by words alone.</P>
<P>Which was the reason that I resolv'd to
describe nothing without an addition of the
Draught at the same time, as being like the
Seal affix'd to Letters Patents to make them
more Authentick. Besides, that the most
famous Travellers in <HI>Paris</HI> have done me
the favour to give me their attestations of
the fidelity and exactness of the Draughts.</P>
<P>Their approbations made several persons
of great Learning and high quality desirous
to see them; among whom, some having done
me the favour to inform our Great Monarch
what I had done, His Majesty was not only
pleas'd to do me the honour to take a view
of some of my Draughts, but was also pleas'd
to command me to go on and to bring them
to him perfect.</P>
<P>After such an Approbation, I hope no
persons will take it amiss, that without put|ting
'em to the trouble of stirring out of their
Closets, I shew them so great a part of the
Glories of the East. From whence it happens
<PB REF="6">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hat the Cities, the Inhabitants, the Edifices,

means of their most noble Ornaments, more
amply and perspicuously than if your selves
had made an examination upon the place. Not
that I question your abilities or fidelity, but
that you would have been no less wise than
others, who not caring to expose themselves
to the dangers that accompany attempts of
this nature in <HI>Turkie,</HI> you would have return'd
home again, content with the sight alone of
what you could not obtain the delineation. All
Travellers will assure ye, that the perills and
hazards are very great to those that make at|tempts
of this nature; no less than the risc of
life, or Religion; dangers which you are no
way forc'd to adventure upon, while your In|formation
comes easie, at the expences of ano|ther
mans Travels.</P>
<P>I begin with the Rarities belonging to <HI>Con|stantinople,</HI>
the Inletts into that City, otherwise
call'd the <HI>Hellespont</HI> and <HI>Dardanells,</HI> together
with the <HI>Propontis.</HI> Next follows the Beautiful
situation of the Haven, the <HI>Grand Serraglio,</HI>
the famous Temple of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> with the
Draughts of its Platform, inside and outside,
the great difficulty a Christian has to get
entrance into this Mosquee, may assure you
of the exactness of the Draughts, besides that
my habit, beard, and knowledge of the Lan|guage
<PB REF="7">
gave me frequent access to places were
others could not have admission, which fail|ing
I made the best use of my wits, and
forc'd my way with presents; so that those
places were to be very well guarded indeed,
that I could not come at, as well to draw,
as when I had done, to compare my Draughts
afterwards with the Original.</P>
<P>To these I have added the Figures of the
three fairest Mosquees in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and
the Postures which the <HI>Turks</HI> observe at
their Prayers. 'Tis true, I have here made
publick but a few of what I have Collected
together during my six years Travells; yet
if these shall be so successful as to please the
publick, I make no question but to produce
a larger number of other parts of the Eastern
world where I have been. To which purpose
I hope the Ingenious will give that encou|ragement
to this small Essay, as that the rest
may follow. And indeed it may in some
measure deserve to be the more taken notice
of, in regard of the honourable approbations
of so many learned men that accompany it.
Who have not only favour'd me with the
following Attestations, but some of them
have also done me the Honour to assure His

<HEAD>A LATE
VOYAGE
TO
CONSTANTINOPLE.</HEAD>
<P>FOR a Gentleman to travel to <HI>Constanti|nople,</HI>
and to view the adjacent Countries,
is certainly one of the most pleasing Di|versions
that may be, and which furnishes
a man with Observations the most admirable, while
he beholds what Nature offers to his Eyes the most
charming that can be imagin'd, in the delectable
situation of Places, and what Time has left, in beau|tiful
Ruins, of the Magnificence and Grandeur of
the Eastern Emperours.</P>
<P>They who have this Curiosity, whether with
an intention to pass farther, or to set up their <HI>Her|cules</HI>
Pillars in this City, are first to understand where
most conveniently to take Shipping; which is most
usually to be done either at <HI>Marseilles, Ligorn,</HI> or
<HI>Venice,</HI> unless they design to travel by Land. Above
all things let them be sure to provide Money for
their Expences, and Bills of Exchange for a Supply;
without which, there is nothing to be done. And
while a Man stays a Ship-board, he will find no false
Latin in a good warm Coat, a good Quilt and Co|verlet,
a Glass of brisk Wine, a Case of good
Waters, and some change of fresh Diet. For all
<PB N="2" REF="10">
which Accommodations, they who desire not to be
troubled with so much Luggage, may agree to be
supply'd by the Master of the Ship, which may be
done for twenty five or thirty Crowns at most.</P>
<P>The first place through which there is a necessity
to sail, is the <HI>Streight</HI> of the <HI>Dardanels,</HI> hither you
arrive by steering several Courses, after you have
left behind you, as well upon the right as left hand,
those Islands which are called <HI>Cyclades</HI> and <HI>Sporades,</HI>
as being scatter'd up and down in that part of the
<HI>Egean</HI> Sea which bears the name of <HI>Archipelago,</HI> by
the Seamen vulgarly stil'd the <HI>Arches.</HI> I shall say
nothing of all those Islands, though I have both seen
and taken the Draughts of most of them, it being
my design to speak only of what relates to <HI>Constan|tinople,</HI>
to which the <HI>Dardanels</HI> are as it were the
Gates that give an Entrance.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Hellespont and the Dardanels.</HEAD>
<P>THis famous <HI>Streight,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. 1.</NOTE> which is otherwise call'd

minutes of Northern Latitude, and of Longitude
about the 55<HI>th.</HI> It extends not in length above
ten or twelve Leagues at most. At the Entrance
it is in breadth a good League and a half. To the

the Country of <HI>Thrace,</HI> which is a part of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI>
divided by the <HI>Hellespont</HI> from <HI>Troas,</HI> a Pro|vince
of <HI>Asia,</HI> that lies to the East. To the North
lies the <HI>Propontis,</HI> and to the South the <HI>Egean</HI> Sea
with the <HI>Archipelago.</HI></P>
<P>At the Entrance of this Streight, upon the right
hand, the <HI>Sygean</HI> Promontory runs out into the Sea
by the name of <HI>Cape Ianisary,</HI> near to which
stands a little Village inhabited by Christian <HI>Greeks.</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="10">
The <HI>Turks</HI> call it <HI>Giaourkioi,</HI> or the <HI>Village of the Infi|dels;</HI>
it being the name which they generally give to
all places where there are no <HI>Mosquees.</HI> It is situa|ted
near to the place where stood in former times
the famous City of <HI>Sygeum,</HI> and by the People of
the Country is call'd <HI>Tro&iuml;aki,</HI> or <HI>Little Troy.</HI> Here
a Traveller may take in store of good Refreshments
and excellent Provision, as Hens, Eggs, Partridge,
Rice, Butter, Melons, Fruit, and all so very cheap,
that you may buy a Quarter of a hundred of Eggs
for four or five <HI>Aspers,</HI> which is no more than two
<HI>Sols</HI> and six <HI>Blanks</HI> of <HI>French</HI> Money;<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 Sols make an <HI>English</HI> Shilling, and 12 Blanks a Sols.</NOTE> and a dozen
of Hens or Pullets for half a <HI>Piaster,</HI> which is not
above 30 <HI>Sols</HI> French. The Water also is there
very good and well tasted; but that is not all; for
the Island of <HI>Tenedos</HI> that produces most excel|lent
Muscadine Wines is not above a League di|stance,
and where you may have it for little or
nothing, a whole Hogshead for a Crown. From
the top of this Cape or Promontory you may take a
full prospect of all the lovely Country of <HI>Troas,</HI>
together with the Rivers of <HI>Xanthus</HI> or <HI>Scamander,</HI>
and <HI>Simois,</HI> both taking their Sources and falling

dry'd up; but at other times both uniting on the
place where <HI>Troy</HI> stood, and there surrounding a
great Marsh or Fen, they glide away under a wooden
Bridge, supported with Stone Pillars, and so empty
themselves into the <HI>Hellespont</HI> some half a League
above this Cape, not far from the new Castle of
<HI>Asia.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="11">The <HI>Turks</HI> who never were addicted themselves
to Liberal Arts, have made it their business rather
to ruin and pull down the Monuments of Antiquity,
than to erect new and sumptuous Fabricks accor|ding
to the strict Rules of Architecture. So that
'tis no wonder, while they so openly profess their
ignorance in this particular, that there should ap|pear
so much deformity and irregularity in this new
Castle of <HI>Asia,</HI> and that which is opposite to it in
<HI>Europe,</HI> or that there is to be seen the same defect in
all their other Castles and Fortresses which they
have occasion to build. This Castle is seated upon
a Tongue of Land pointing out into the Sea, upon a
square Platform compos'd of four large Panes of
Walls, flank'd at the four Corners with Towers;
of which, those two next the Sea are square, with
a sort of Redoubt only upon one side; the other
two toward the Land are quite round. Between
these four Towers there are five others, of which,
four are also square, and one round, which de|fend
the Walls, but neither in thickness, bigness,
or distance, one like the other. As for those which
are wash'd by the Sea, they are furnish'd with Port|holes
that lie level with the surface of the Water,
as also with their Curtins and Platforms. I told
above forty of these well provided with Cannon,
always mounted and continually charg'd, ready to
play upon any Enemy that will run the hazard of
adventuring into the Harbour by force.</P>
<P>But notwithstanding all this Expence and Cost
bestow'd upon these Castles, there is no such neces|sity
for a Royal Navy to fear the force of that Bat|tery,
should a good occasion present it self to try
the utmost of its Fury. For all the Cannons which
are within, are mounted only upon Stones or great
pieces of square Timber, without Frames or Car|riages.
<PB N="5" REF="11">
So that being once discharg'd, they will
require a long time to charge and mount 'em again.
In which interval of Time, it would be no diffcult
thing with two or three thundering Broadsides to
lay the inconsiderable Wall of the Castle level with
the Earth, it not being above three foot in thick|ness,
or beat it about the Ears of the Soldiers and
Cannoneers. By which means the Castles so made
useless, would soon be taken by Storm or Surrender.
The way to this Castle is from the North, (and joyns
at the end of a Street to a very fair <HI>Mosquee</HI> which
stands on the South side not far from the Shoar) from
whence you may very plainly discern the <HI>Duomo</HI> and
the Tower of the Temple.</P>
<P>Between this new Castle which the <HI>Turks</HI> call
<HI>Natoli-inghi-issar,</HI> and Cape <HI>Ianisary,</HI> there lies
to the North-east, a small Village or Borough, which
carries the name of <HI>Inghi-issar-kioi,</HI> that is to say,
the Borough of <HI>Newcastle.</HI> There is nothing consi|derable
that belongs to it, only the prospect of eight
Windmills that stand all arow as you walk to the
<HI>Sygean</HI> Promontory. Every one of these Mills are
turn'd by eight Vanes, as is usual all over <HI>Turkie:</HI>
Which is certainly done, to the end the Mills may
have greater force to bruise and grind the Husk of
the Grain, which causes the Flower to yield very
little Bran, and is the reason also that the Bread
which the <HI>Turks</HI> eat is nothing so white as ours, be|cause
there passes so much of the thin-ground Bran
through the Bolter among the Flower.</P>
<P>And here now might I take occasion to talk of
<HI>Achilles,</HI> and several others of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Captains
that were interr'd upon this Promontory, as also to
make a description of the Ruins of the so much re|nown'd
<HI>Ilium,</HI> of which the unfortunate Remains are
to be discover'd not only upon Cape <HI>Sygeum,</HI> but also
<PB N="6" REF="12">
in the Sea it self, and the Iland of <HI>Tenedos.</HI> But be|cause
several Travellers have prevented me, I shall
say no more than only this: That if we consider
how long it has been since the Ruin of this great
City of <HI>Troy,</HI> and the prodigious quantity of Pillars
and other Marble Pieces which the <HI>Christian</HI> and <HI>Tur|kish</HI>
Emperours residing in <HI>Constantinople</HI> made use of
out of these Ruinous Heaps for Materials to build
their Churches, Mosquees, Palaces, Baths, and other
public Structures, and then consider likewise the vast
Remains that still are left behind in broken pieces of
<HI>Corinthian</HI> Architecture, we may certainly affirm,
that <HI>Troy</HI> was one of the fairest, richest, and largest
Cities of its time. 'Tis true, that the greatest part
of those Ruins which now are to be seen, may be
thought to be later than the Destruction of the <HI>Gre|cian</HI>
Flames, in regard that the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperours,
and <HI>Augustus</HI> among the rest, sent several Colonies
to renew the Pristine Glory of their Foster City, out
of kindness to the first Original of the <HI>Roman</HI> Gran|deur;
but we are not thence to conclude, that it
ever arriv'd at that Pomp and Magnificence wherein
it flourish'd in the days of the Unfortunate <HI>Priam.</HI>
Nor was that Restauration of any long continuance,
seeing that in <HI>Lucan</HI>'s time it was the same that now
it is above sixteen hundred Years ago, as he himself
testifies in the following Lines.</P>
<LG>
<L>Iam Sylvae steriles, &amp; putres Robore trunci</L>
<L>Assaraci pressere Domos, &amp; Templa Deorum</L>
<L>Iam lassa Radice tenent, ac tota teguntur</L>
<L>Pergama dumetis.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now barren Woods and Oaks with Age decay'd,</L>
<L><HI>Assaracus</HI>'s Palaces o'respread,</L>
<L>The God's own Temples by their Roots fast bound,</L>
<L>With <HI>Pergamum,</HI> lie cover'd under ground.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="7" REF="12">In short, the place where formerly stood that
famous City, is now overgrown with Bushes and
Brambles, spreading themselves among the Ruins
that lye upon the descent of the Hill, which seems
to have been the chiefest and best inhabited part of
ancient <HI>Troy.</HI> This place is distant from the Sea,
where in ancient Times was the Haven which be|long'd
to <HI>Troy,</HI> about a good League of bad way
among Briers and Thorns. If any Traveller
should be so happy as to meet in any of the Tombs
which he shall find as he goes along, or in any
other part of the Ruins of this great City, a cer|tain
<HI>Greek</HI> Manuscript, entitl'd&punc; <GAP DESC="foreign">
<HI>The Golden Compendium,
or the ancient Book of the Kikanides,</HI> he would highly
oblige the Commonwealth of Learning, by making
it public to the World. For a certain Author
assures us, that this Book lies buried in a certain
Tomb within the City of <HI>Troy,</HI> together with the
Bones of her first King <HI>Kicanis.</HI> For my own part
I never could find it, and therefore left the search
of it to some other person more fortunate than my
self. And indeed I must confess, that I never be|held
the Ruins of <HI>Troy,</HI> which I have done now four
times over, but still it perplexes me, that I could
never yet be able to discover the least Inscription
or Monument of Antiquity, which might afford
me the least light into any particular of its being
taken, or its ancient Splendour, but that I was
still forc'd to go away with the same Exclamation
of the <HI>Greek</HI> Poet:
<Q><GAP DESC="foreign"></Q>
<Q>Alas! alas! the unfortunate Foundation of the
heretofore most happy <HI>Asian</HI> Land.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="13">Seldom any person goes to view the Ruins of
<HI>Troy,</HI> but he also crosses over to the Island of <HI>Tene|dos,</HI>
which lies just opposite against it. This Island
is very pleasant and delectable to those that love
good Wine, and delight in Hawking or Shooting,
for there is great store of Wild-fowl, and plenty
of Muscadel, and other excellent Wines.</P>
<P>The Harbour is not very considerable, only for
small <HI>Turkish</HI> Vessels or <HI>Saicques;</HI> but for Ships of
any greater force or burthen, it is no way fit to
receive them.</P>
<P>However as bad as the Harbour is, yet the Island
might be of great use for the erecting a strong
Arsenal and a good Magazine, to put a curb upon
the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> the <HI>Propontis,</HI> and <HI>Thracian Bosphorus,</HI>
and to preserve the Dominion of the <HI>Archipelago.</HI></P>
<P>During the stay which I made in this Island,
two <HI>French Tartans</HI> came to an Anchor in the Road.
For the same fowl weather that had caus'd the
<HI>Saicque</HI> or <HI>Turkish</HI> Vessel, wherein I was a Passenger
from <HI>Smyrna</HI> to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> to put into <HI>Tenedos,</HI>
oblig'd the <HI>French-men</HI> to seek the same shelter.
Stopping at this Port, some of the <HI>French</HI> Officers
came ashore to refresh themselves, and were dire|cted
by a <HI>Greek</HI> that spoke <HI>Italian</HI> to the House
where I was. They found me sitting at Table with
a young <HI>Turk,</HI> who was also a Passenger in the same
Vessel with my self, and not so scrupulous as others
of his Religion in the business of drinking Wine,
especially when he met with so good, as was that
of <HI>Tenedos.</HI> However by reason of my Eastern
Habit, my long Beard, and because I also discours'd
in <HI>Turshish</HI> with my <HI>Ioldache,</HI> or Fellow-traveller,
the <HI>French-men</HI> little thought me to be their Coun|try-man,
and that I understood every word they
said. Thereupon they talk'd freely one to ano|ther,
<PB N="9" REF="13">
and at length discoursing over their Cups,
they began to fall upon the <HI>Turkish</HI> and <HI>Grecian</HI> Wo|men,
as well in <HI>Tenedos,</HI> as in all the other Islands of
the <HI>Archipelago.</HI></P>
<P>For a while I said not a word to them, but kept
talking on with my <HI>Turk:</HI> 'Till at last quite tir'd
with hearing their extravagant Raillery occasion'd
by the Wine, I could forbear no longer. And
therefore faigning my self a <HI>Turk,</HI> only that I had
been in <HI>France</HI> in the Train of <HI>Mustapha Aga,</HI> who
was return'd about a year before, I told 'em in
downright <HI>French,</HI> and like one that was somewhat
angry withall, <Q>That 'twas a sign they were
<HI>French-men,</HI> and had drank hard to talk so boldly
and impudently as they did, and to reproach and
abuse our Women even to our faces, and in our
own Country. Know Gentlemen, <HI>said I,</HI> that both
by Reason and Custom they are much more re|serv'd
than yours. And though there may be
some who perhaps may think bad enough, yet
there is such good Order taken throughout this
Empire, that they are depriv'd thereby of the
opportunity to act. They seldom stir out of
Doors, and they seldom are seen at any public
Meetings or Assemblies. If sometimes they are
permitted to go to their Devotions, they walk
with their Faces vail'd, not daring to speak to
any Man they meet; whereas the <HI>French</HI> Ladies
make no scruple to march alone with a single
Gallant, and admit him to tell Stories by their
Bed-sides. And therefore, <HI>continu'd I,</HI> be not
so rash another time to make such hard Censures
upon such a ticklish point; for had I not a more
than ordinary kindness for your Nation, I would
soon let you understand the Power I have to re|form
your Judgments, and reduce ye from those
<PB N="10" REF="14">
wild and inconsiderate Errors into which the
Wine has plung'd ye, and learn ye to descant
so idly upon a Truth which ye have so little
examin'd.</Q></P>
<P>Never were People more surpriz'd than these
persons were, so that I am apt to believe, had not
the Wine inspir'd 'em with more than ordinary Cou|rage,
the threatning Language which I gave them
would have caus'd them to have made hast back to
their Vessels. However, I could perceive they sat ve|ry
uneasie, 'till I my self believing I had kept 'em long
enough in suspence, deliver'd them out of their
bodily Fears, by first drinking the King's Health,
and then informing them, that I was both their
Country-man and Friend, and that the <HI>Turkish</HI> Ha|bit
which I wore, was only such as I was forc'd to
wear to gain me freer and more easie passage in my
Travels to and fro. And so the Frolick ended in
a Glass or two of Wine more, 'till we had empty'd
an <HI>Ocque</HI> of Muscadine, containing about three
<HI>Chiopins</HI> or <HI>French</HI> Quarts. The next night the
Wind chopping about, we weigh'd Anchor by break
of day, and left the Island of <HI>Tenedos,</HI> of which I
shall make no farther description, in regard the
Plate which I have made of it, is too large for this
Volume.</P>
<P>Having left <HI>Tenedos</HI> and doubl'd the <HI>Sygean Cape,</HI>
we came between the two new Castles of <HI>Europe</HI>
and <HI>Asia.</HI> One I have already describ'd, I shall
now describe the other. This new Castle upon
<HI>Europe</HI> side, which the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Roumeli-inghi-issar,</HI>
was built as well as the other opposite to it, by the
present Sultan <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Fourth, the 23<HI>d</HI> Empe|rour
of the <HI>Turks.</HI> This haughty Potentate, being
swell'd up with his Conquests, as being but feebly
attack'd by his neighbouring Enemies, always be|liev'd,
<PB N="11" REF="14">
that the advantageous situation of the <HI>Dar|danels</HI>
was such as render'd it an Enterprize impos|sible
to break i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">to the <HI>Propontis,</HI> and that conse|quently
the City of <HI>Constantinople</HI> was impregnably
secur'd on that side. He was perswaded, as were
also his Ancestors, that this same <HI>Streight</HI> of the Sea,
which is the Gate of that Imperial City, was suffi|ciently
guarded and fortifi'd by those two Castles,
which the <HI>Turks</HI> esteem'd to be extreamly strong.
But having been given to understand to his cost and
damage, in the year 1656, and the year following,
that a bold and generous Captain stood in no fear of
those Fortresses, and finding that those two magni|ficent
Piles, for the space of somewhat more than a
Twelvemonth, had rather serv'd for Theaters, to
behold the total defeat of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Navy, than
as places of succour and defence against the <HI>Vene|tians,</HI>
who fought the said Navy within reach of
their Cannon, and triumph'd in their full view:
Fearing therefore a second loss of the same kind, he
caus'd those new Castles to be built at the entry of
the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> according to the form and situation
describ'd in the Draught. It will be necessary there|fore,
before I give any farther description of those
two Fortresses, that the Reader permit me to make
him a brief Relation of those two famous Actions,
and the success of the Christian Arms, so fatal at
that time to the <HI>Mahometans.</HI> They are proper
to the subject of my Discourse, and I am the more
oblig'd to make the Relation, as being engag'd in
my acknowledgments to those two illustrious Per|sons,
to whose kindnesses and company in my Tra|vels
I was so peculiarly bound, as being highly
honour'd in their Affection. These were the Lords
<HI>Mark</HI> and <HI>Ambrose Bembo,</HI> both Gentlemen of <HI>Ve|nice,</HI>
who have always perform'd great Exploits,
<PB N="12" REF="15">
and daily add to the Fame and Splendour of the
noble and ancient Family of the <HI>Bembo's.</HI></P>
<P>The first of these two noble <HI>Venetians</HI> was Gene|ral
of the Gallies of the Commonwealth of <HI>Ve|nice</HI>
in this Expediton. The second is a young
Gentleman his Nephew, who at the Age of eighteen
years, perceiving that the leisure of the Republic in
Peace could not afford him matter sufficient to
exercise his active Courage, generously quitted the
pleasures of a sedentary Life, and betook himself
to five or six years travel over the Eastern World.
And in these perils and dangers he the more readily
engag'd himself, to the end, that upon his return
to his Country with mature Age and well-purchas'd
Experience, he might render himself the fitter for
such Employments which the Senate might deem
worthy his merit. I had the happiness to meet
him at <HI>Hispahan,</HI> returning from the <HI>Indies,</HI> whence
I also had the honour to enjoy his Company all the
way into <HI>Europe.</HI> In pursuance of which Journey,
we came first into <HI>Syria</HI> to his most illustrious
Uncle <HI>Mark Bembo</HI>'s Residence, then Embassado<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r
for the Republic, and so at length arriv'd at <HI>Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="4 letters">,</HI>
where I was shew'd in the Palace of the <HI>Bembo</HI>'s the
whole Expedition of the <HI>Dardanels,</HI> set forth in a
large piece of Painting, and rarely well done; and
so from those who were there present, I had this
account.</P>
<P>In the heat of the War of <HI>Candy, Marcello Moro|sini</HI>
General of the Men of War, and <HI>Marco Bembo</HI>
General of the Gallies of the Republic, with Mon|sieur
the Prior of <HI>Rochel,</HI> who commanded seven
Gallies of <HI>Malta,</HI> having intelligence that the Fleet
of the <HI>Turks,</HI> consisting of sixty Gallies, thirty Men
of War, forty five Galiotes, eight Mahons, and se|veral
other light Vessels, was ready to set Sail from
<PB N="13" REF="15">
<HI>Constantinople</HI> with recruits to the Camp before
<HI>Candy,</HI> they boldly sail'd away to the <HI>Dardanels</HI>
to hinder the <HI>Turks</HI> from coming forth, though
they had no more than twenty four Gallies, twenty
eight Men of War, seven Galeasses, and some few
other smaller Vessels. There they came to an An|chor,
and staid in expectation of the <HI>Ottomans,</HI> for
about a Month, who upon notice of their arrival,
durst not stir from <HI>Gallipoli.</HI> But at length, the
<HI>Captain Basha</HI> understanding that the <HI>Venetian</HI> Fleet
was much inferiour to him in number of Men and
strength of Ships, weary of being so long pent up
within the Castles, resolv'd to weigh, and by the
favour of Wind and Tide to attack the <HI>Venetians,</HI>
and force his passage through their whole Body.</P>
<P>And now the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Fleet being come under
the Protection of the <HI>Dardanel</HI> Cannon, the <HI>Vene|tians</HI>
impatient of so long a delay, made toward
the Enemy, and set upon them so furiously for a
whole day together, and with that success, that
of all the great number of <HI>Turkish</HI> Vessels already
mention'd, only fourteen could possibly save them|selves,
who to avoid a general loss, were forc'd to
make use of all their Oars and Slaves to get under
the Protection of the two old Castles, the rest being
all taken or sunk before their faces. True it is
that the General <HI>Marcello Morosini</HI> being too far
engag'd in pursuit of the flying <HI>Ottomans,</HI> was
kill'd with a Cannon Shot, having lost about three
hundred of his Men. But General <HI>Marco Bembo,</HI>
according to his wonted Valour and Prudence, re|solv'd
to take the advantage of this Success, and
to revenge upon the Island of <HI>Tenedos</HI> the loss of
<HI>Morosini,</HI> whose place was soon after supply'd by
<HI>Lazaro Mocenigo</HI> elected in his room. These two
Generals therefore knowing the important Situa|tion
<PB N="14" REF="16">
of <HI>Tenedos</HI> to curb the <HI>Dardanels,</HI> and secure
themselves Masters of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> presently
laid Siege to it, and carry'd it in fourteen days,
and then fortifi'd it, and furnish'd it with Provi|sions.</P>
<P>Nor is this the only time that the haughty <HI>Turks</HI>
have been thus boldly outbrav'd upon their own
Coasts. They who have read the History of <HI>Ve|nice,</HI>
or remember the War of <HI>Candy,</HI> can tell how
frequently the Christian Arms have defeated the
<HI>Ottoman</HI> Fleets, and taken their Ships within sight,
and within the reach of these Castles. Among the
rest, that exploit of General <HI>Delphino,</HI> in the year
1654. may serve for another Example, which can|not
be too often repeated; besides, that my Obli|gations
to the most eminent Cardinal <HI>Delfino</HI> his
Brother in some measure compell me to renew the
Relation.</P>
<P>This illustrious General finding himself separa|ted
by a Storm from the rest of his Fleet, with no
more than four of his own Ships, met the next
morning the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Navy, compos'd of thirty
four great Vessels, fourteen others of less burthen,
two Corsairs, forty Gallies, and six Galeasses, with
which he was surrounded in an instant. This pro|digious
disproportion of Ships, Men, and Force, was
enough to have scar'd 'em into a present Surrender,
and to have daunted the Courage of any one but
this undaunted Hero. However he was nothing at
all astonish'd; but on the other side encouraging his
slender Squadron either to overcome or dye, he de|fended
himself with so much prowess, and was so
well seconded by Signior <HI>Iohn-Baptista de Sessa,</HI> and
the rest of the Commanders of his small number,
that he sunk several Vessels of the Enemy, kill'd
above four thousand <HI>Turks,</HI> he boarded the <HI>Sultaness,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="16">
and took her Colours from her, and at length quit|ted
himself with Honour from the throng of his
Enemies, with his four Vessels, and little loss of
Men.</P>
<P>The famous Captain <HI>Georgio Maria</HI> would cer|tainly
have done the same, had he been well secon|ded
by those two Ships that were in his Company.
But they treacherously and basely deserted him, and
left him to fight all alone to the last drop, so that he
deserv'd at one time the honour of having defended
himself without assistance, and the reputation sin|gly
to have encounter'd the whole <HI>Ottoman</HI> Fleet.
Another <HI>Venetian</HI> Corsair had set him a fair presi|dent
sometime before, who singly sustain'd the fury
of the whole <HI>Ottoman</HI> Fleet in the Channel of <HI>Chio,</HI>
where they had surpriz'd him, and yet got clear of
them all, after he had fought for five or six hours,
and very much endamag'd the Enemy.</P>
<P>But not to stop at any more of these Relations,
of which an infinite number might be brought, I
shall proceed to the description of the two For|tresses
of the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> by which a shrewd conje|cture
may be made of the strength of their other
<HI>Militia.</HI></P>
<P>These two Castles then being built after the
two generous Exploits of <HI>Bembo</HI> and <HI>Mocenigo,</HI>
have no more reason to terrifie a brave and resolute
Commander, than if they had never been erected.</P>
<P>They are seated one from the other at such a
distance, that a Ship may easily sail betwixt them
both, without any great danger of their Culverins;
they being distant the one from the other more
than a League. They are both commanded by
Hills, more especially that on <HI>Europe</HI> side, which
is seated near to Cape <HI>Greco,</HI> for its form altoge|ther
irregular. The compass of the Walls con|tains
<PB N="16" REF="17">
certain Houses for the <HI>Aga</HI> and other Officers,
with a <HI>Mosquee,</HI> of which the <HI>Domo</HI> and Steeple
appear very plain to be seen, as well as the other
Edifices, as being generally seated in the highest
parts of the Fortification, from whence you de|scend
by large steps to the Platforms where the
Guns are Planted, which lie equal with the surface
of the Water. Near to this Castle lies a small
Village, remarkable for nothing; together with
five large Pilasters that serve to underprop several
conveyances of Water to the Fort.</P>
<P>You are no sooner past these two new Castles,
but you come to that part of the Sea which is call'd
the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> or St. <HI>Georges Arm,</HI> into which
they are the Inlets. It has been always the Thea|ter
of famous Actions, which the better a Man
understands the <HI>Greek, Latin,</HI> and Modern Histo|ry,
with the greater delight he calls this place
to memory. It is a great satisfaction at one and
the same time, with one glance of the Eye to be|hold
<HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia</HI> so nearly joyn'd together,
as if they had a desire to embrace and unite under
one and the same Conquerour, or that they did only
separate there to open him a passage, and facilitate
his generous Enterprises.</P>
<P>From these new Castles which we have describ'd,
'till ye come to the Old ones, there is nothing to
be set down worthy Observation at this present
time. Antiquity indeed beheld the shore adorn'd
with several Cities and fair Villages, whose names
are now so utterly forgotten, that they are no
where to be found but in History. The People
of the Country, as well <HI>Greeks</HI> as <HI>Turks,</HI> are so
miserably overwhelm'd with Ignorance, that 'tis
a vanity to ask them any Questions concerning them,
or to expect from them the least accompt of the
<PB N="17" REF="17">
place where the unfortunate <HI>Helle</HI> was drown'd,
who losing her life in passing this same <HI>Streight,</HI>
at what time she fled from <HI>Colchis</HI> with her Brother
<HI>Phryxus</HI> with the famous <HI>Golden Fleece,</HI> bequeath'd
her Name and Life to the honour of this narrow
Arm of the Sea. They know nothing of the
City of <HI>Arisbe,</HI> to which <HI>Homer</HI> gives the Epithite
of <HI>Divine,</HI> nor of the Promontory or Town of
<HI>Raetion,</HI> where the brave <HI>Ajax</HI> was entomb'd;
being ignorant whether it were upon that Cape
where now stands the new Castle of <HI>Asia,</HI> or upon
that same jetty of Land near to the Mouth of <HI>Xan|thus</HI>
and <HI>Simois.</HI> So that you travel all this way,
whether by Sea or Land 'tis all one, without ob|serving
any thing remarkable; and at length
you arrive at the old Castles which the <HI>Turks</HI> call
<HI>Boghase-issari,</HI> or the Castles of the <HI>Throat.</HI></P>
<P>The old Castle upon <HI>Asia</HI> side by the name of
<HI>Natoli-iski-issar,</HI> is a square Building flank'd at the
four corners with Towers, of which those that are
next the Sea are four-square also, but those that
look toward the Land are round. In the midst of
this Castle is a large square Tower, upon whose
Platform are planted several Culverins. From
this same Tower was made the fatal Shot that took
away the Life of <HI>Lazaro Mocenigo,</HI> at what time
(after he had giv'n a second defeat to the <HI>Turks</HI>
Fleet in the year 1657) he was designing in spite
of these Castles to have run up the Channel, and
have fir'd <HI>Constantinople,</HI> had not that unfortunate
blow at the same time disappointed him in the pur|suit
of so noble an Enterprise. Behind this Castle
lies a large Village inhabited by about three thou|sand
People, whereof some few are <HI>Christians,</HI> the
rest <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Iews.</HI> This place is considerable
for nothing but for the command of the Passage
<PB N="18" REF="18">
where it lies, and the most part of the great Guns
lye unmounted even with the surface of the Wa|ter,
like those in the new Castles. They are in
number twenty eight, and carry to the other side of
the opposite shoar large Stone Balls, each weighing
sixty pound, as likewise do those which are planted
on the other side in the <HI>European</HI> Castle, the Chan|nel
lying between these two Castles not being
above half a League broad.</P>
<P>The <HI>European</HI> Castle, which the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Rou|meli-iski-issar,</HI>
is more irregular, and not so strong
as that upon the <HI>Asiatic</HI> side. It is plac'd upon the
descent of a Hill which commands it, and is com|pos'd
of three great Towers joyn'd together in a
Triangular form, resembling the shape of a Heart.
These Towers are environ'd with a circuit of Walls
with certain half Towers, which descend to the
Harbour, where lye about thirty Cannons equal
with the Water, that carry the same Bullet with
those on the other side; and they are planted ob|liquely,
lest by shooting streight forward the two
Castles should mischief one another. Most people
believe, that these two Castles, and the two Towns
adjoyning, are the Ruins of the two ancient Cities
of <HI>Sestos</HI> and <HI>Abydos;</HI> but in regard there are several
that question the truth of it, and that it is a difficult
thing to prove it, unless some curious Traveller
shall hereafter discover something more convin|cing,
I shall leave the matter undetermin'd. The
<HI>Franks</HI> or <HI>Europeans</HI> who travel into <HI>Turkie,</HI> call
these two Castles the <HI>Dardanels,</HI> for that <HI>Dardanus</HI>
the Son of <HI>Iupiter</HI> by <HI>Electra</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Atlas</HI>
was the first King of this Country, who built
therein a City, which he call'd by his own name
<HI>Dardanum,</HI> and the Country round about it <HI>Dar|dania.
Virgil</HI> will have this City to be the same
<PB N="19" REF="18">
with <HI>Troy,</HI> so call'd by <HI>Tros</HI> the Grandchild of <HI>Dar|danus,</HI>
and Father of the fair <HI>Ganimed.</HI> Others
assure us, that the ancient <HI>Dardanum</HI> which was
built upon the <HI>Hellespont</HI> where now the <HI>Dardanels</HI>
stand, retain'd its ancient name, and that the new
City built upon the <HI>Xanthus</HI> and <HI>Scamander,</HI> was first
call'd <HI>Dardanum,</HI> afterwards <HI>Troy</HI> or <HI>Ilium.</HI> How|ever
it were, the Inhabitants of that ancient <HI>Darda|num</HI>
did not much exceed in Reputation those that
now possess the <HI>Dardanels:</HI> For those formerly
were accounted Magicians, according to that of
<HI>Columella;</HI>
<Q><LG>
<L>At si nulla valet Medicina repellere Pestem,</L>
<L>Dardaniae veniant artes &mdash;</L>
</LG></Q>
<Q><LG>
<L>But if no Physic can repell the Plague,</L>
<L>Let then Dardanian arts be us'd &mdash;</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Or else such as minded nothing but their Profit,
according to that of another Poet:
<Q><L>Dardanius merces divendit carius emptas.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Dardanian Wares he sells, more dearly bought.</L></Q></P>
<P>They who now inhabit those Castles are much
of the same disposition, where, as in several other
parts of <HI>Greece</HI> you shall find several of those old
kind of Sorceresses which they call <HI>Striglais,</HI>
who being addicted to all sorts of mischief in
their Infancy, and despairing of any other Allure|ments
to purchase their Love, put to sale the Affe|ctions
of others, of which they falsly vaunt them|selves
to be the Mistresses; or else they sell the
satisfaction of their Hatred. They make use of
<PB N="20" REF="19">
several sorts of Witchcraft, some they call <HI>Philtra,</HI>
to create Affection; others <HI>Ecthra,</HI> to procure Ha|tred;
others <HI>Vaskarmiais</HI> or <HI>Phtarmiais,</HI> that deal
in all sorts of Fascinations and Enchantments.
These old Haggs practice after various manners,
according to the mischief which they design; and
although they go to work but by night and in se|cret,
for fear of being apprehended by the <HI>Souba|chi,</HI>
and thrown into the Sea with a Stone about
their Necks, ty'd up in a Sack; yet I shall here set
down one remarkable passage, which was related to
me by a person that liv'd upon the place concer|ning
one of these Witches that was taken in the
fact.</P>
<P>This same Race of <HI>Circe,</HI> having a design to re|venge
themselves upon any one that has perhaps
but given them cross language in the Street, do it in
this manner. They rise about Midnight, and take
three Flint Stones, over which they mumble for
about half an hour certain words, which they
teach to none but their Scholars. Which being
done, they put the Stones in the Fire 'till they are
red hot, at what time they take 'em out again to
light a little Wax Candle at each, which they
place upon the three feet of a three-legg'd Stool, in
a kind of imitation of the <HI>Trikirion</HI> of the <HI>Greek</HI>
Bishops. This done, they lay the three-legg'd
Stool across upon their Heads, take up the three
Flints, by this time cold, and in this Equipage forth
they go into the Street where the Party lives, and
being come to the first place where they find three
ways to meet, they throw the three Stones into the
three different passages, believing, that by the help
of such words which they utter at the same time,
that those Fascinations will procure the mischief
they intend. Beside these, they have also a hun|dred
<PB N="21" REF="19">
other little Tricks, which they practice as well
for the telling of Fortunes, as for Witchcraft, to
which, as the more rational <HI>Turks</HI> give little or no
credit, so are they much less worth mentioning
here.</P>
<P>As for their Trading, the most part of the Mer|chants
in the Towns belonging to these two Ca|stles,
especially the <HI>Iews,</HI> are great gainers: For
they buy cheap out of the <HI>Christian</HI> and <HI>Turkish</HI>
Vessels that pass through the Channel, and sell
again with considerable advantage, either upon the
place, or else they carry their Markets to other
Towns and Villages upon the dry Land, where they
turn to good accompt. But as it is common with
all Merchants to sell as dear as they can, I shall say
no more concerning the Inhabitants of the <HI>Darda|nels,</HI>
who do no more than <HI>Castor</HI> in <HI>Martial:</HI>
<Q><L>Omnia Castor emit; sic fiet ut omnia vendat.</L>
<L>Castor buyes all, and so must all things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ell.</L></Q></P>
<P>I forgot to advertise the Reader, that when you
come near these Castles by Sea, you are bound to
salute 'em, by giving 'em a certain number of Guns
proportionable to the Burthen and Quality of your
Ship. For the <HI>Saics,</HI> in which I happen'd to be
three times a Passenger to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> though no
other than great Boats, like those that pass between
<HI>Roan</HI> and <HI>Paris,</HI> and which had no other sort of
Artillery besides two or three Pot-Guns, were how|ever
forc'd to discharge them, without any return
from the Castles. But as to other Vessels of grea|ter
bulk and force, I shall relate what I have far|ther
observ'd. When a considerable Merchant|man
comes near either of the Castles, it behoves him
<PB N="22" REF="20">
to give them at least three, if not five or seven
Guns. But if it be a Man of War, he must give
seven at least, otherwise nine or eleven, to which
the Castle answers with one, three, or five, to which
the Man of War returns three, five, or seven; and
so steers on her Course, if she be inward bound.
But if they be Ships that be outward bound, whe|ther
Merchants or sometimes Men of War, they
are forc'd to stay two or three days, 'till they have
been duly search'd and examin'd. Which will not
permit me to forbear one short Story wherein I
had a concern my self.</P>
<P>When <HI>Mustapha Aga,</HI> who was sent into <HI>France</HI>
in the year 1669. had finish'd his Embassy, the King
sent him back to <HI>Constantinople</HI> attended by four Men
of War well appointed, who also carried Monsieur
<HI>de Nointel</HI> to reside at the Port in the room of Mon|sieur
<HI>de la Haye-Vantelet.</HI> These four Men of War,
under the Command of Monsieur <HI>d' Aplemont,</HI> being
arriv'd at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> rode there six weeks at an
Anchor; so that while the two <HI>French</HI> Embassa|dours
were preparing the one for his reception, and
the other providing for his departure, the four
Captains had the opportunity to pleasure a great
many poor Slaves that privately stole aboard in
order to their Liberty. All that came were kindly
receiv'd, a number indeed so considerable, that
might well oblige their Patrons to complain to the
<HI>Caimacan,</HI> or Governour of <HI>Constantinople.</HI> But in
regard the greatest part of these poor Slaves were
people of no value, and only belonging to some of
the City Traders, and persons of mean condition,
the <HI>Caimacan</HI> gave the Complainants only soft an|swers,
but did no more. For he knew that Mon|sieur
<HI>d' Aplemont,</HI> having formerly threaten'd, when
he had but one Ship, to fire the <HI>Seraglio</HI> and the City
<PB N="23" REF="20">
if he had not satisfaction given to his demands, was
not a person easily to be compell'd to restore the
Slaves he had taken, under the protection of four
stout Men of War. Nor had the <HI>Caimacan</HI> taken
any farther notice of what pass'd aboard the <HI>French,</HI>
had he not been oblig'd to it by the escape of Mon|sieur
<HI>de Beau-jeu.</HI> This illustrious Knight of <HI>Malta,</HI>
weary of several years Captivity in the Castle of
the seven Towers, where he was a Slave to the
<HI>Grand Signor,</HI> resolv'd to lay hold of the opportu|nity
of the four Men of War lying in the Road,
and to free himself by a slight which the <HI>French</HI> Ad|miral
had promis'd to second. In short, he made a
brisk and cunning escape out of the Castle, but being
too quick for the Shallop that was sent to receive
him, for fear of being pursu'd, and discover'd by
certain Dogs that bark'd after his heels, he was
constrain'd to take the Water, not without great
danger; for a <HI>Saic</HI> coming along, he receiv'd a
good knock of the pate from one of the Oars,
which forc'd him to dive; and he had been cer|tainly
lost, had not the <HI>Turks</HI> taken him for one of
those very Creatures from which he fled. But
at length the Shallop took him up, and carry'd him
aboard. The next morning the <HI>Aga</HI> of the seven
Towers understood his Prisoner was flown, and
thereupon went and gave the <HI>Caimacan</HI> immediate
notice of it, who then thought it high time to send
Post away to the <HI>Dardanels</HI> to stop the four Men of
War until they had restor'd Monsieur <HI>Beaujeu.</HI> The
Courier got thither before the King's Vessels were
pass'd, though they set sail almost at the same time
that the Gally put forth; so that when they came
near the two old Castles, the Forts never stay'd for
a Salute, but to prevent their kindness, saluted them
first with two or three great Guns laden with
<PB N="24" REF="21">
Ball as well as Powder from both sides of the
Channel.</P>
<P>This was signal enough to the Men of War, that
they were to pass no farther by fair means. Where|upon
they came to an Anchor, and immediately
Monsieur <HI>d' Aplemont</HI> the Admiral sent to the <HI>Aga</HI> of
the Castles, whose Quarters are generally upon
<HI>Asia</HI> side, to demand the reason of his so uncivil
Complements to the <HI>French</HI> Fleet. The <HI>Aga</HI> re|turn'd
for answer, That he had orders not to let
him stir any farther, unless he surrender'd back the
Body of Monsieur <HI>Beaujeu,</HI> who was his Highnesses
the <HI>Sultan</HI>'s Slave; and with him likewise the Bo|dies
of three hundred Slaves more which he was
carrying away, that had made their escapes from
several private persons, their Masters; to which
purpose he intended to send his Officers aboard him
to make the same search which was usually made
of all Merchants Vessels in the Road, that set
sail from <HI>Constantinople.</HI> Monsieur <HI>d' Aplemont</HI> gave
him to understand by his Interpreter, that he had
no Slaves aboard, for that all Men were born free;
so that if he should be so adventurous as to send
any persons to search his Master's Ships, he would
hang them up at the Yards Arm in sight of his Ca|stles;
and that as to what concern'd the freedom
of his passage, he did not much trouble his thoughts
about it. For that if the Courier which he would
dispatch to <HI>Adrianople</HI> with his own, if he pleas'd,
did not bring him an Order for free passage, he
would give notice two days before he weigh'd An|chor,
to the end he might have the more time to
prepare himself within his Forts against the fury
of the <HI>French</HI> Valour and Artillery.</P>
<P>This was an Answer very bold and haughty,
considering the place where Monsieur <HI>d' Aplemont</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="21">
lay. Nevertheless I verily believe he would have
been as good as his word. For during the time
that the Messengers were absent, he employ'd his
Men in fitting and preparing all things ready, as
well for the attack, as for his own defence. But in
thirteen days the Messenger return'd, and brought
from <HI>Adrianople</HI> express Orders to the <HI>Aga</HI> of the
Castles to let the <HI>French</HI> Vessels pass, with all the
persons that were aboard. At what time also the
<HI>Grand Signor</HI> sent away to the <HI>Caimacan</HI> of <HI>Con|stantinople</HI>
a severe Command to cut off the Head
of the <HI>Aga</HI> of the seven Towers, to learn both
him and his Successors for the future to be more
careful of the Prisoners of that Castle, especially
when they were of such great Quality as Monsieur
<HI>Beaujeu.</HI> These Orders were quickly obey'd; so
that the King's Ships weigh'd Anchor the next day,
and departed.</P>
<P>In this same part of this Streight it was, that
<HI>Xerxes,</HI> enrag'd to see the foaming and tempe|stuous
Waves oppose his passage into <HI>Greece,</HI> caus'd
the Sea to be whipp'd, and afterwards in disdain of
its Power, joyn'd both the Continents together by
a Bridge of Boats, and made the Sea as it were
to groan under the weight of the floating Burthen.</P>
<P>However in the same place it was, that soon after
the chaf'd Billows fully reveng'd themselves for
the injury done them. For breaking the Chains
of the Bridge with a violent storm, the Sea was in a
short time fill'd with the Ruins, and shatter'd pieces
of that laborious piece of Humane Haughtiness.
So that <HI>Xerxes</HI> being soon after constrain'd to fly
the same way, and finding his vain-glorious Tri|umph
o're the <HI>Hellespont</HI> utterly destroy'd, was
enforc'd to betake himself disguis'd to a small Fi|sherboat
to save his life, and rescue himself from
<PB N="26" REF="22">
the general Massacre of his Army; so hard it was
then for him to get a small Skiff to avoid the
Chains and Shackles of a victorious Enemy, who
but a little before had vaunted of his having
shackl'd the Ocean, drank up Rivers, and sail'd
over the dry Land, as it were to insult over Nature
her self.</P>
<P>Some perhaps may say, that I tarry too long be|tween
<HI>Sestos</HI> and <HI>Abydos,</HI> and bid me beware, lest
out of a desire to entertain the Reader with such
remarkable passages as have renown'd these Parts,
I run the risco of <HI>Leander</HI>'s misfortune: for he, co|vetous
to converse with his amiable <HI>Hero,</HI> was lost
in this narrow Bay, mistaking the steerage of his
Arms. In the same manner the satisfaction which
I find in tracing over again the Representation of
the same Places, and calling to mind the several
passages of Antiquity that happen'd there, may be
thought to have withdrawn me too far from my
Subject. Wherefore I shall leave <HI>Sestos</HI> and <HI>Aby|dos,</HI>
and come now to <HI>Lampsacus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lampsa|cus.</NOTE> that lies not
far from it. This City is not now in that splendid
condition wherein it flourish'd, at what time it was
by <HI>Xerxes</HI> appointed to furnish <HI>Themistocles</HI> with
Wine for him and his Attendants; being at pre|sent
no more than a miserable Village, which re|tains
nothing of its Antiquity, but the Hills that
environ it, still cover'd with some few Vines, whose
Grapes are pleasing, and the Wine which they
afford most excellent, but not very plentiful.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Magnesia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Magne|sia.</NOTE> the Metropolis of <HI>Lydia,</HI>
which was also allotted to the same <HI>Grecian</HI> Cap|tain,
for his provision of Bread, has much better
preserv'd its ancient Magnificence, being still very
large, fair, rich, and in good Trade. But as for
<HI>Myus</HI> in <HI>Ionia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Myus.</NOTE> the third City appointed to <HI>Themi|stocles</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="22">
for the substantial Food of himself and his
Followers, it has been a long time buried in its
own Ruins.</P>
<P>On the left hand over against <HI>Lampsacus</HI> stands
the City of <HI>Caligula,</HI> corruptly call'd <HI>Gallipoli.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gallipoli.</NOTE>
This is a large City, and the Port very convenient
and spacious. It appears much above the Sea, and
as most of the Sea-Towns of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Empire is
peopl'd with <HI>Christians, Iews,</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> who
have every one their Churches, Synagogues, and
Mosquees, and corresponding very amicably toge|ther,
maintain themselves and their Families, either
by Merchandize, or by their Handicraft Trades.</P>
<P>Nor can I yet quit the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> without adding
this farther for the benefit of all Seamen, what
they are to observe, and how to steer to avoid the
dangers of this passage. Upon the first entrance
into this Streight, it behoves you to steer first North
and North and by East for the space of about a
League to the low Point upon the Eastern shoar a
little above the Mouth of <HI>Simois,</HI> which must be
avoided by reason of a Sand-bank that stretches
toward the West. After which, you must steer
Northward, then North-east and by East for about
eight Leagues, as far as <HI>Gallipoli,</HI> to the West of
which lies a large Bay, where you ride in a safe
Road secure from the Northern Winds, in twenty
fathom Water. But entering into this Port, you
must take care of coming too near the South Coast
of <HI>Gallipoli,</HI> by reason of a Bank of Sand, and
certain Rocks that lye hid under Water; and for
the same reason take the same care to avoid steering
too near to the North, and thus <HI>In medio tutissimus
ibis;</HI> which is a Rule indeed to be observ'd through
the whole <HI>Hellespont.</HI></P>

<P>The whole circuit of the <HI>Propontis,</HI> which is

and within the 55<HI>th</HI> and 58<HI>th</HI> Degrees of

from this Situation, that it lies in a most
temperate Climate, which neither admits the bit|ter
freezings of the North, nor is subject to the
stifling Southern heats. So that there is not hardly
to be seen in any other part of the World, so small a
spot of Ground, whereon so many fair Cities have
been built, as upon the shoar of this round Recep|tacle
of salt Water. The famous <HI>Cyzicum,</HI> the
renown'd <HI>Nice,</HI> the delightful <HI>Apamea,</HI> the char|ming
<HI>Nicomedia,</HI> the unfortunate <HI>Chalcedon,</HI> and
several other Cities of great repute, are sufficient
Testimonies, that this celebated part of the World
had omitted nothing that might contribute to the
Embelishment of her temperate Shoar. All these
Cities lye upon the right hand to those Vessels that
<PB N="29" REF="23">
sail from <HI>Gallipoli</HI> to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> while <HI>Europe</HI> on

the new and ancient <HI>Perinthus</HI> or <HI>Heraclea, Selivrea,
Bevado, Grandpont,</HI> and some others not worthy
Commendation. And in regard I have seen all
these Cities one after another in my several Travels,
I shall say something of every one in particular, in
the same order as I have nam'd them, and as they
are seated to the view of those that go to <HI>Constan|tinople.</HI></P>
<P>The ancient City of <HI>Cyzicum,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cyzicum.</NOTE> which is one of
the first that appears to the right hand upon the
Coast of <HI>Asia,</HI> was famous for the Antiquity of its
Foundation, which it derives from the <HI>Argonauts,</HI>
near five hundred years before the building of <HI>Rome;</HI>
for its situation, which was in a lovely Island joyn'd
to the Shoar with two large Bridges; for its lofty
Towers and magnificent Buildings, for the most
part all of Marble: For three great Arsenals or
Magazines carefully kept in repair, and provided
continually with plenty of all things necessary for
the preservation of the Inhabitants. The first was
a Store-house of Arms offensive and defensive. The
second, of all sorts of Tools, Houshold Furniture,
and other Necessaries, not only for the Inhabitants,
but for all that were subject to the Jurisdiction of
the City. And the third contain'd the Granaries for
Corn, and other public Provisions for the common
benefit. The Liberty also which this City enjoy'd,
and which the Inhabitants always resolutely fought
to maintain, render'd it no less famous. 'Tis true,
they lost it once out of their extream desire to pre|serve
it; at what time not being able to endure
the Insolence of the <HI>Romans,</HI> they put some of them
in Irons, and caus'd others to be whipp'd; which
so incens'd <HI>Augustus,</HI> that he depriv'd them of their
<PB N="30" REF="24">
Liberty which they held so dear, and which they
had acquir'd during the War with the <HI>Mithri|dates.</HI>
But at length that noble Prince (o'recome
with the Submissions of the Citizens, who to ap|pease
his Anger, finish'd the Temple which before
they had began in honour of him, though negle|cted
during their Troubles) restor'd them their
former Liberty. In this City it was, that the Em|perours
<HI>Severus</HI> put <HI>Pescennius Niger</HI> to death, for
revolting against him in <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>But of all those great advantages which formerly
it enjoy'd, there remains nothing now but that of
its situation, It is at present joyn'd to the Conti|nent
by an <HI>Isthmus</HI> about half a League broad, made
out of the Ruins of those two great Bridges which
were formerly built over the Sea, and were two
flight Shot in length. Upon two sides of the Island,
that is to say, to the North and to the East, lie two
fair Harbours, now utterly forsaken, as is also the
City it self, which has nothing that remains to
testifie its ancient Grandeur but prodigious heaps
of stately Buildings overturn'd one upon another.
Yet among these deplorable Ruins of its ancient
Grandeur, there appears upon a pleasant Hill a
very fair Amphitheater of an Oval figure, sufficient
to contain twelve thousand Spectators. From this
Amphitheater, and those other parts of the Hill
where you see all that remains of <HI>Cyzicum,</HI> you may
discover the two bosoms of Land that compose the
Harbours. But all these Buildings are quite aban|don'd
now by all Human Resort, unless it be of Some
few Travellers that are curious to behold the Re|licks
of Antiquity. So that now that place where
the confus'd noise of Number, and the din of
People of various Trades and Occupations made
such a noise, as would not let the roaring of the
<PB N="31" REF="24">
Sea be heard, hears nothing but the mournful cries
of Owls and Ravens, and the doleful howlings
of solitary Beasts, that shelter themselves in their
Nests and Dens among those once stately Fabricks
and Monuments of the ambition of the <HI>Cyzice|nians.</HI></P>
<P>As for the City of <HI>Nice,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nice.</NOTE> which the <HI>Turks</HI> call
<HI>Isnir,</HI> though it might not be thought perhaps one
of the most celebrated Cities in the World for the
famous Council of three hundred and eighteen Bi|shops
there held in the year 325, during the Reign
and in the presence of the Great <HI>Constantine,</HI> under
the Pontificate of St. <HI>Sylvester;</HI> yet may it be so ac|knowledg'd
by reason of its Foundations first laid
by <HI>Antigonus</HI> King of <HI>Asia,</HI> Son of <HI>Philip,</HI> who
call'd it by his own name <HI>Antigonia,</HI> afterwards
call'd <HI>Nicea</HI> by <HI>Lysimachus,</HI> according to the name
of his Wife. This City is almost four-square,
plac'd upon a little Bosom of the Sea between two
Capes, in a fair Plain. About two Leagues to the
North-east runs a long row or chain of small Hills
abounding in Wood, Wine, Fruits, and Fountains.
The Walls of it are about eight Miles in circuit,
defended with large Towers for the most part
round, containing several Rooms. They were
formerly surrounded with a Terrass, like the Walls
of some of the Cities in <HI>France;</HI> but the <HI>Turks</HI>
taking no care to repair them, they are now tumbl'd
down, and fall'n to decay in several places. The
City is large, beautifi'd with very fair Streets, and
several Relicks of Antiquity, as well <HI>Christian</HI> as
<HI>Pagan;</HI> among the rest with a stately Gate to the
South-west, built all of Marble like a Triumphal
Arch, adorn'd with several Figures, which the <HI>Turks</HI>
hav'd defac'd, and several Inscriptions as well <HI>Greek</HI>
as <HI>Latin.</HI> There are also to be seen several very
<PB N="32" REF="25">
curious pieces of Antiquity, as well in the City
as in the Parts adjoyning, of which I took seve|ral
Draughts; but having lost them, together with
others, and all the Money which I then had, through
the unlucky accident of our Caravan's meeting
with the <HI>Arabs,</HI> as we travell'd from this City to
<HI>Aleppo;</HI> I must beg the favour of the Reader to be
content to share in my Misfortunes and my Losses.
At present there are not above ten thousand Inha|bitants
in <HI>Nicea,</HI> counting as well the <HI>Christian
Greeks,</HI> as <HI>Iews</HI> and <HI>Turks.</HI> They live altogether
upon the Trade which they drive in their Corn,
Fruits, Cottons, Linnen, and other Commodities
which they carry to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> from whence
it is not distant by Sea above fifty Leagues, or
sixscore Miles by Land.</P>
<P>Among all the great number of Cities which have
born the name of <HI>Apamea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Apanea.</NOTE> that which the <HI>Turks</HI> now
call <HI>Montagniac</HI> is one, unless there be any that can
make it out to be the City of <HI>Nicopolis.</HI> But if we
may rather believe the ancient Inscriptions which
are to be found upon the places, then we may con|clude
that <HI>Montagniac</HI> is no other than <HI>Apamea.</HI>
Monsieur <HI>Vaillant,</HI> a person famous in the search of
Antiquity, and whose company I had the happiness
to enjoy in this City, found a very fair Inscription
upon a piece of square Marble, whereon the name
of <HI>Apamea</HI> was engraven. True it is, that this
Inscription might have been brought from some
neighbouring place. However, if <HI>Montagniac</HI> be
not <HI>Apamea,</HI> most certainly 'tis not far from the
place where <HI>Apamea</HI> stood. And therefore having
nothing more of certainty my self, I shall leave the
farther discussion of this Dispute to the foremen|tion'd
famous Traveller, in those Relations which
he gives us hopes will be made public, and where we
<PB N="33" REF="25">
may likewise expect this Inscription among the
rest.</P>
<P>The Situation of this little City is most pleasing,
The Bay upon the Shore of which it is built, is
called <HI>Sinus Cianus,</HI> from the Ancient City of <HI>Cium,</HI>
of which the Ruins are yet to be seen; but now it
bears no other name than that of <HI>Montagniac;</HI> by
means whereof this City drives a vast Trade with
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> in regard that the shortness of the
way between it and <HI>Bursa,</HI> draws to it almost all
the Traffick of that great City and of almost all
<HI>Bithynia,</HI> of which <HI>Bursa</HI> is the <HI>Metropolis.</HI> From
<HI>Montagniac</HI> to <HI>Bursa, Brusa, Brousa,</HI> or <HI>Bursia,</HI> (for
it is called by all these names) it is but five Leagues
Journey through a very pleasant Country, and
passably well manured. There are in <HI>Montagniac</HI>
about five or six thousand Inhabitants, <HI>Greeks,
Turks</HI> and <HI>Iews,</HI> who are all Merchants, and live
by the Traffick of their Commodities. The
Country adjoyning to this City is very Fertile in all
sorts of Fruits which are carried to the Markets of
<HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P>It is a difficult thing to find a Situation more
advantagious than that of <HI>Nicomedia.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nicome|dia.</NOTE> Certainly
next to that of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> it claims the pre|heminence
in that respect above all other Cities.
For it is seated at the bottom of a Bay which bears
its name, and covers the descent of a small Hill
replenished with fruit Trees Vines and Corn. A
great number of Gardens belong to it, where grow
most excellent Fruits, and among the rest <HI>Melons,</HI>
which are nothing inferiour to those of <HI>Cashan</HI>
in <HI>Persia,</HI> that are esteemed the best in the
World. The Curious Traveller also who is de|sirous
to have a Stock of Fair Inscriptions, may
easily satisfie his Curiosity in this City of <HI>Nico|media.</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="26">
For there are hardly any of the Streets
or Church Yards, where he may not find some
Fragments, and sometimes such as are intire, both
in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin:</HI> And it is as true, that this
City has been always in high Repute, ever since it
was enlarged by <HI>Nicomede,</HI> King of <HI>Bithynia,</HI> who
gave it the name of <HI>Nicomedia,</HI> instead of that of
<HI>Olbia,</HI> from the Nymph <HI>Olbia,</HI> who first laid the
Foundations of it. Here it was that <HI>Hannibal,</HI>
after all his defeats, fled for Refuge to <HI>Prusias,</HI>
King of <HI>Bithynia;</HI> and where at length, that un|fortunate
Captain, fearing to be surrender'd up
into the hands of the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> whom he had
ruin'd by his ill Luck, or of the <HI>Romans</HI> who had
sent to demand him from <HI>Prusias,</HI> ended his days
by Poison, which he always carried in the beazil of
a Ring.</P>
<P>This City was one of the first that embrac'd
the Christian Faith, for which Reason the great
number of Holy Martyrs that there generously
suffered several sorts of Deaths in defence of the
Truth, have rendred it the more Illustrious. St.
<HI>Barba</HI> was one of that happy number, and of the
same place, as also St. <HI>Adrian,</HI> St. <HI>Pantaleon,</HI>
St. <HI>Gorgon,</HI> whose Body we have in <HI>France,</HI> being
brought from <HI>Rome</HI> by one of the <HI>Nephews</HI> of <HI>Pepin,</HI>
in the Year, 763. Near to this City it was also,
that the Great <HI>Constantine,</HI> being sixty six Years of
Age, died of a Fever in the Year, 340. Some
Authors report, that this Emperour being fallen
into the Heresy of the <HI>Arians,</HI> which was con|demned
in his presence by the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI>
resolved to be rebaptized in the River of <HI>Iordan;</HI>
to which purpose being upon his Journey from
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> he fell sick at <HI>Nicomedia,</HI> where
<HI>Eusebius</HI> the Bishop being infected with <HI>Arianism,</HI>
rebaptized him into the <HI>Arian</HI> Opinion.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="26">The Bay of <HI>Nicomedia,</HI> is not above half a
League in breadth, but in length much more;
On both sides of which runs a Ridge of small
Hills, which accompanying all along the windings
and turnings of the Bay, render the Passage by
Water one of the most pleasant Recreations that
can be desired. This City which the <HI>Turks</HI> call
<HI>Ismir,</HI> is very large and well peopled, containing
above thirty thousand Inhabitants, consisting of
<HI>Greeks, Iews</HI> and <HI>Turks;</HI> several <HI>Greek</HI> Churches
and Fair <HI>Mosquees,</HI> many <HI>Caravansera's</HI> or <HI>Inns,</HI> and
several <HI>Bazars</HI> or Market places. The Trade of
the Town consists in Silks, Cottons, Wooll, Linnen,
Fruits, Pot-making, Glass-houses, and other Com|modities,
which render it a place of great Traffick.
The most part of the great <HI>Saiques, Kaiques,</HI> and
other vessels belonging to the Merchants of <HI>Con|stantinople</HI>
are built at <HI>Nicomedia.</HI> But I must needs
say their building for the Sea, is very little better
than their Architecture by Land. For though
their Vessels are built very large and Roomy, yet
are they but ill Saylors, and therefore easily taken.
While I happened to be there, they were building
two <HI>Saiq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">es,</HI> that were three Years before they
were fitted. Which being done, they were car|ried
to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> to take in their Lading, and
make their first Voyage. Their bulk astonished
the <HI>Constantinopolitans,</HI> seeing them so high built
and so large, there being no vessel in the Haven
that appeared other than little Barks to them.
Presently they were moor'd in the Port of <HI>Cour|chiou,</HI>
the Magazine of this Place, with their
Heads turned toward <HI>Mecca.</HI> Then came the
<HI>Iman,</HI> or <HI>Priest</HI> of that Quarter, as it were to
consecrate the two new Vessels, or rather to charm
them by the Vertue of their accustomed Prayers
<PB N="36" REF="27">
against the misfortunes of Shipwrack and Piracy.
Being thus enchanted, they were laden; being laden,
they were again blessed by the <HI>Iman</HI> with a Tun
of Benedictions and good wishes of a happy and
prosperous Voyage, and then set Sail for the Coast
of <HI>Egypt;</HI> but they were no sooner passed the
<HI>Dardanells,</HI> and entered the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> when a
<HI>Corsaire</HI> of <HI>Malta</HI> made bold to shorten their
Voyage, and to carry away the two Wonders of
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> Lading, Benedictions and all, to his
own Port.</P>
<P>To the West of <HI>Nicomedia,</HI> on the North side
of the Gulph, there rises a Spring of Mineral
water, to my thinking chiefly partaking of Alum,
of which the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> relate wonders.
There is great resort to it from all Parts, for they
believe there is no distemper under the Sun which
it does not cure. For my own part, the only
Curiosity of going to see it, had like to have cost
me my Eyes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t Issues from a Rock at the foot of a
little Hill, from whence gliding along toward the
Bay, together with some other small streams, it
waters a flat kind of <HI>Green</HI> full of weeds and
rushes; which is all Marshie in the Winter, but
was dry when I went over it. Here it was that
walking over these Rushes, two Wasps whose
peace I had disturbed, in revenge made presently
to my Eyes and very angrily stung me under the
Brows. The pain that I felt was extream, and
the swelling so great that I could not open my Eyes
in a Quarter of an hour, so that if I had not had
the good fortune to have had Monsieur <HI>Vaillant</HI>
(as skilful in Physick as Antiquity) in my Com|pany,
I know not whether I might not rather
have been put to have groped my way back to
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> than hoped to have seen <HI>Persia.</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="27">
But he was so happy as immediately to find
out a certain Herb, with the juice of which
mixed with water, after he had well washed
my Eyes, he soon asswaged the pain, so that I
went forward and took a view of that same Cele|brated
<HI>Agiasma,</HI> or Holy Fountain. A little far|ther
Westward, on the Southside of the Bay,
appears a little Langet of dry Land, just like a
great Heap of Earth, not above six Fathom in
Breadth, and about half a quarter of a League in
length. At the farther end of which, toward the
Land side, stands a <HI>Mosquee,</HI> of which the <HI>Turks</HI>
tell a pleasant Miracle. It happened, say they,
that upon a certain Festival among the <HI>Turks,</HI>
a certain <HI>Dervich,</HI> or <HI>Mahometan</HI> Monk, who lived
on the other side of the Bay to the North, accord|ing
to his Custom prepared himself very early to
perform his Devotions, and say his usual <HI>Mat|tins</HI>
at the forementioned <HI>Mosquee.</HI> But the night
before, a Storm having robbed him of his little
Boat and carried it quite away, and so not know|ing
how to get over the Bay, he prayed to God
to inspire him what to do in his sad Condition.
Well, his Prayer was heard, and thereupon <HI>Melek
Gebrail,</HI> or the Angel <HI>Gabriel,</HI> fails not to attend
him; who bids him go to the Sea shore and fill the
Lappet of his Coat with as much sand as it would
hold, which being done, he bid him cast the sand
before him as he went, and it should presently
harden into a path for him to walk upon the Wa|ter.
The good <HI>Hermit</HI> followed the Angels whole|some
advice, but whether he had not taken sand
enough, or whether he did not strow enough upon
the yielding waves, his Causey sank behind him,
nor could he go forward, for that he had spent all
his sand. In this Extremity the <HI>Dervich</HI> fell again
<PB N="38" REF="28">
to his Prayers and his Tears, which were so pre|valent,
that <HI>Mahomet</HI> himself then took notice
of him, and observing to what danger the holy
<HI>Mussel-man</HI> had exposed himself, that he might
perform his devotions at the <HI>Mosquee,</HI> obtained of
God to advance a Langet of dry Land as far as
where the <HI>Dervich</HI> stood, on purpose to take him
up, and to afford him a safe passage to the <HI>Mos|quee.</HI>
Since which time this Langet of Land has
remained as it stands to perpetuate the memory of
this Miracle.</P>
<P>Sayling out of the Gulph of <HI>Nicomedia,</HI> you
enter into the Sea of <HI>Chalcedon,</HI> in the midd'st of
which little Sea, not above ten Leagues in Cir|cumference,
you meet with a great Watch-Tower,
erected at the end of a Promontory, not far distant
from <HI>Chalcedon</HI> it self. Upon which Promontory
also stands a House of Pleasure belonging to the
Grand <HI>Signor,</HI> known by the Name of <HI>Fanari-Kiosk.</HI>
This word <HI>Kiosc</HI> in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language
signifies a covered Gallery. For that as well this
same <HI>Kiosc</HI> here mentioned, as also all the rest that
are to be seen in <HI>Turky,</HI> are only built of several
Pillars erected upon a Square, supporting Galleries
that run from side to side, and are covered with
a large low Roof in the manner of a Pavil|lion.</P>
<P>The Situation of this <HI>Kiosc</HI> is very delectable,
as being placed in the midst, and in the highest
part of a most beautiful Garden, the most regularly
planted of any that are to be seen in <HI>Turky;</HI> the
Alleys being streight, the Trees planted at an
equal distance, with several Beds and Borders of
Flowers Artificially drawn forth&punc; (Whereas all
the other Gardens belonging to the Grand <HI>Signor,</HI>
are only a Confusion of Trees growing as they
<PB N="39" REF="28">
were planted, without any Order or neatness, like
so many petty Wildernesses.) All these Alleys
lead to the <HI>Kiosc,</HI> which every way delights the
Eye with a pleasing Prospect. For from hence
you may behold the greatest part of the City of
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> the Grand <HI>Serraglio,</HI> and <HI>Galata,</HI>
which lyes to the West of this Garden, at the
distance of about a good League. The Haven
and City of <HI>Chalcedon</HI> lyes upon the right hand to
the Northwest; the Islands of the <HI>Princes,</HI> and
the <HI>Propontis</HI> face it to the Southeast; the Entry
of the Gulph of <HI>Nicomedia</HI> appears upon the left
hand to the South; and the lovely Fields of <HI>Bithy|nia,</HI>
(upon the farthest Extent of which this
beautiful Structure presents it self to view,)
spread themselves from the back part of it beyond
the reach of sight.</P>
<P>The Charming Situation whereof invited
<HI>Sultan Solyman</HI> the Second to erect a Palace of
Pleasure in this place, that here he might with
more freedom enjoy his Amours, and wanton away
his hours of leisure with his <HI>Sultanesses.</HI> In the
midst of this Structure, a fair ascent leads ye into
a beautiful <HI>Sopha,</HI> or Room of State, richly fur|nished
with Quilts, Carpets, and Cushions of high
value, and encompassed with Balisters Embellish'd
with <HI>Moresco</HI> Work. This <HI>Sopha</HI> is four square,
and placed almost in the middle of a large Concavity
of the same Form, wherein are several Artificial
Water-works continually supplied with water,
sufficient to bath in. This Potent <HI>Monarch,</HI> no less
addicted to his Amorous Enjoyments, than to the
love of Martial Atchievments, was careful to
adorn this Structure with all the gay embellish|ments,
that <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ometan</HI> Architecture could invent,
to consummate as well his own, as the divertise|ments
<PB N="40" REF="29">
of the <HI>Sultanesses</HI> whom he best loved. Ta|king
delight frequently to retire in their Company
from his <HI>Serraglio</HI> at <HI>Constantinople</HI> to this place,
as not being above a League from thence, where
being arrived he gave himself up to enjoy with
more secresie and less trouble, the Satisfaction of
those pleasures which an inordinate Passion could
provoke him to, in a place so well accommodated
for his wanton purposes.</P>
<P>The watch Tower adjoyning to this <HI>Kiosc</HI> is of
great benefit to such Vessels as Sail by night to
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> of which there are a great Num|ber;
or to such as come to an Anchor near to
<HI>Chalcedon,</HI> which does not happen so frequent|ly.</P>
<P>The Haven as also the City of <HI>Chalcedon</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chalce|don.</NOTE> are
neither much frequented, unless it be by some
<HI>Barks</HI> and <HI>Saics</HI> which go to <HI>Constantinople</HI> to fetch
Provisions that are wanting here. Formerly this
City was one of the most Famous that stood upon
the <HI>Propontis.</HI> And it is said that one <HI>Chalcedon</HI>
a Shepherd, and Son of <HI>Saturn,</HI> first began to
build some certain Cottages upon the Banks of a
small River that watered the adjoyning Meadows,
to which he gave his own name. A long time after
the Inhabitants of <HI>Chalcis</HI> in the Island of <HI>Euboea,</HI>
now called the <HI>Negropont,</HI> sent a Collony thither,
continuing the name which before it had, as being
not much different from the Name of their own
City. The <HI>Megareans,</HI> not far from the Corin|thian
<HI>Isthmus,</HI> did the like about the Year of the
World 3290. But in regard that both the one
and the other, by their choice of <HI>Chalcedon,</HI> had
overseen that noble Situation which shewed it self
over against them, where now <HI>Constantinople</HI> stands,
therefore it was that the Oracle of <HI>Delphos</HI> ad|judged
<PB N="41" REF="29">
them both to be blind, and that <HI>Megabizu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>
the <HI>Persian,</HI> and all that have come after him,
have still to this day confirm'd the Sentence of the
Oracle. For my part, I cannot but wonder that
among so many that have called them <HI>Blind,</HI> there
is not one who has called them <HI>Fools. Arrian,</HI>
the Historian and their Neighbour, as being born
in the City of <HI>Nicomedia,</HI> relates, that those
People having for some time neglected the Wor|ship
of a Certain Deity, to which their Ancestors
had Erected a Temple, were visited with a noy|some
and shameful disease. For which not finding
any other remedy, they thought the readiest way
to preserve the rest of the Body, would be to cut
off the part infected, though of never so great use
to the whole. This incens'd Deity was certainly
<HI>Venus,</HI> who had a most beautiful Temple in <HI>Chal|cedon,</HI>
and the Distemper no doubt was one of
those, of which she is generally the Primary
cause. The disease was doubtless very irksome,
and the remedy much worse, and doubtless it was
their great misfortune, that they had not so much
as one of our Empericks to Plaster their Walls, as
they do here at <HI>London,</HI> with their Infallible Vene|real
Cures; for surely he would have been the
most acceptable person in the World to the <HI>Chalce|donian</HI>
Ladies, who bemoaned their Widowhoods,
while yet their Husbands were alive.</P>
<P>However at present there remain no footsteps
either of this Temple of <HI>Venus,</HI> or of that of
<HI>Apollo,</HI> which one <HI>Cocconas</HI> rendered Famous by
the Oracles, which (by slight of Invention) he
made the <HI>bright-hair'd Deity</HI> deliver there as well
as at <HI>Delphos.</HI> This <HI>Cocconas</HI> envying the Cities
of <HI>Delphos</HI> in <HI>Phocis, Claros</HI> in <HI>Ionia,</HI> and <HI>Delos</HI>
in the <HI>Egean</HI> Sea, which were become so renowned
<PB N="42" REF="30">
and wealthy by means of the Oracles of <HI>Apollo,</HI>
b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">hought himself at length of a way to bring
the Fortune-Telling God to his City, and to make
him speak in his Temple. To that intent he ob|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ain'd
to be elected one of <HI>Apollo's</HI> Priests, and
in a short time having got the knack of wrapping
up his Answers in Ambiguous Terms, he so raised
the Fame of <HI>Chalcedonian Apollo,</HI> that he gain'd the
Resort of all <HI>Thrace, Bithynia, Phrygia,</HI> and all the
neighbouring Provinces.</P>
<P>But neither these Temples of <HI>Pagan</HI> Antiquity,
nor those of the Primitive Church, are now any
more to be seen. The Ruin'd City is now con|tented
only with a small part of a Church for|merly
Dedicated to St. <HI>Euphemia,</HI> whither those
few <HI>Greeks</HI> that live in the City resort to perform
their Religious Duties. And in this Church it
was that the fourth General and oecumenical Coun|cel
was held. As for any other pieces of Anti|quity,
there are only some few Tombs, and short
Inscriptions, and the fair Reliques of a subter|raneal
<HI>Aquaduct.</HI> The Haven is now no longer
chain'd as formerly to guard the Entrance; and
yet though it lies open thus to all, not one jot for
that the more frequented. In short <HI>Chalcedon,</HI> to
which <HI>Chrysopolis</HI> or <HI>Galata</HI> in former times was
only a Haven for its Gallies, and a Magazin for
the Public Stores, retains at present nothing of its
Illustrious Antiquity, but the Name, being only a
miserable Village containing about a Thousand
or twelve Hundred Houses, surrounded with heaps
of Ancient Ruins, and Monuments of Destruction.
The <HI>Persians, Goths, Saracens,</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> have all
successively contributed to it's overthrow, it
having felt the fatal effects of all their Cruelties,
and the too near Neighbourhood of <HI>Constantinople</HI>
<PB N="43" REF="30">
has been a Potent Obstacle to its Recovery. The
Eastern <HI>Emperours,</HI> who always since the time of
<HI>Constantine</HI> the Great made <HI>Constantinople</HI> the Seat
of the Empire, made it their business to advance
the Splendor of that City with the Spoils as well
of her Neighbours as her Enemies. Of which
number the Emperor <HI>Valens</HI> was one, who alone
wasted <HI>Chalcedon</HI> more than all her other Enemies.
He threw down all her Walls, which were built
of fair large Stones, and a small matter would
have urg'd him entirely to have rased it, for that
she had harbour'd his Enemy <HI>Procopius,</HI> and was
suspected to have strongly favoured his Party.
The Great <HI>Aquaduct</HI> also at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> adjoyn|ing
to the <HI>Solimanie,</HI> and the best part of that
<HI>Mosquee,</HI> was Erected out of the Ruins of this
unfortunate City.</P>
<P>But this Road which I have described is never
much regarded in going to <HI>Constantinople;</HI> for all
Vessels leave the beautiful Shores of <HI>Bithynia</HI> upon
the right hand, and keep Coasting for the most
part upon the shoar of <HI>Thrace.</HI></P>
<P>So then leaving the <HI>Hellespont,</HI> the first City
you meet with is <HI>Rodosto.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rodosto.</NOTE> A City well seated at
the bottom of a small Bay, which gives it the
Convenience of an indifferent good Harbour. It
is well peopled with about fifteen thousand Inhabi|tants.
The Trade which it drives with all <HI>Thrace,</HI>
the <HI>Propontis,</HI> and over all the <HI>Black Sea,</HI> causes
it to be more frequented than any other City upon
that Coast, it is adorn'd with three or four large
<HI>Mosquees,</HI> and several other lesser ones, besides
that the <HI>Greeks</HI> have also some Churches in it,
and the <HI>Iews</HI> two <HI>Synagogues.</HI> It lies stretched out

chiefest Commerce, being surrounded to the Land|ward
<PB N="44" REF="31">
with several Gardens replenished with store
of good fruit; though for their way of manuring
and ordering their Ground, it seems not to be much
better there, than in any other part of <HI>Turkey;</HI>
the <HI>Mahometans</HI> being as little skill'd in Gardening
as in Architecture. For though they have a great
number of persons that call themselves <HI>Bostangis</HI> or
<HI>Gardiners</HI> they are much more beholding to Nature
for producing the Fruit, than to Art for Cultivating
or dressing either Plants or Trees.</P>
<P>They sow great store of Cotton, Cucumbers,
ordinary Melons, water Melons, and such kind of
cooling Fruits, which are not however so kindly,
as they that grow about <HI>Nicomedia.</HI></P>
<P>Leaving the little Bay of <HI>Rodosto,</HI> you meet
with upon the left hand the Ancient City of <HI>Pe|rinthus.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Perin|thus.</NOTE>
This is almost the fortieth City in num|ber
that has born the Name of <HI>Heraclea:</HI> and if
among all the misfortunes that have befallen it,
it had not still preserved its name, you would
hardly believe, beholding the deplorable Condition
to which it is reduced, that what remains could be
the Ruins of that once so loudly Celebrated <HI>Pe|rinthus,</HI>
which formerly gave Laws to the Proud
<HI>Byzantium</HI> it self, under whose Tyranny it now so
heavily groans.</P>
<P>This City is Seated in 42 degrees 25 min.
of Northern Latitude, round a Promontory some|what
ascending, which on each side makes two
indifferent good Harbours; of which, that which
lies to the North-East, is the biggest and most
secure, and consequently most frequented. But
in regard there is no care taken to cleanse it, and
for that the <HI>Turks</HI> suffer it to be insensibly fill'd up
with the Rubbish that falls continually from the
ruinous buildings, of which there are several close

adjoyning to the shoar, the Haven is now very
much impair'd, and capable of receiving only
Ordinary Barks and <HI>Turkish Saicks,</HI> of small Bur|den;
whereas in the Reign of the Emperor <HI>Severus,</HI>
and long before and after his Time, it afforded
Commodious and safe Harbour to Royal Navies,
and Ships of the greatest burthen then Built.</P>
<P>The Haven it self is almost Circular, and much
resembling the Form of a Horshooe, affording a
most pleasing Prospect, though not altogether so
delightful, as that which extends it self from the
Promontory upon the left hand. From the upper
part of this Promontory you discover the two
Havens belonging to <HI>Heraclea,</HI> between which it
swells up into a fair ascent, and the Sea of <HI>Mar|mora,</HI>
which lies directly before it and the whole
City; and besides, the beautiful Fields which in|viron
it, contribute very much to the advantage
of its Situation. And certainly upon this place
it was that the noble <HI>Amphitheater</HI> of <HI>Heraclea</HI>
was erected, which in the Records of <HI>Antiquity</HI>
has obtained the Renown of being one of the
seven Wonders of the World. Some Ruins of it
still remain, and among the rest several Vaults
or Cellars full of water which is extreamly fresh
and clear, that now supply the want of Cisterns.
From these <HI>Reservatories</HI> it was without all question
that the water was conveyed through different
Pipes, to the several Apartiments of the <HI>Amphi|theater,</HI>
where they had occasion.</P>
<P>Neither was this the only considerable Structure
in <HI>Heraclea.</HI> For besides the stately Temples, the
most delicate Bathing places, and other public
Buildings, there were also several Statues, pieces
of rare and Exquisite Workmanship, erected in the
several Streets, in remembrance of those who
<PB N="46" REF="32">
had been any way beneficial to the Common-wealth.
The Statues themselves are now unhap|pily
broken to pieces, through the Barbarity of
succeeding Ages. But their <HI>Pedestals,</HI> together
with the Inscriptions still to be Read, plainly
demonstrate the high gratitude of the <HI>Perinthians</HI>
toward their Benefactors. Which as it confirms
the Generosity of the Ancient <HI>Heracleotes,</HI> so may
we thence conclude <HI>Heraclea</HI> and <HI>Perinthus</HI> to be the
same. The <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI> Inscriptions in several
parts of the City yet undefaced, and the apparent
Reliques of Antiquity still extant, confirm that of
the Poet,
<Q><LG>
<L>&mdash;quae magna Perinthus</L>
<L>Ante fuit, priscum mutavit Heraclea nomen.</L>
</LG></Q>
<Q><LG>
<L>&mdash;Which Great Perinthus was before,</L>
<L>But Heraclea now has chang'd the Name of yore.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>There is hardly a street which does not shew
some Testimony of this Truth; in regard that
many of those Engraven Monuments are now made
use of for Steps to the common Habitations of the
Citizens. But the most remarkable Inscription
now to be seen in <HI>Heraclea,</HI> remains upon a Stone
that is Mortased into the wall of the Great Church
adjoyning to the Street which leads to <HI>Adrianople.</HI>
The words are in <HI>Greek,</HI> and Dedicated to the
good Fortune of the Emperor <HI>Severus.</HI> For he
it was that to be reveng'd upon the City of <HI>Byzan|tium,</HI>
for taking the part of <HI>Pescennius Niger,</HI>
subdued it, and annexed it to the Territories of
the <HI>Perinthian</HI> Common-wealth, whose Rival for
Dominion she had formerly been.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="32">There is also another Inscription near to the
same Church, in the House of the Metropolitan,
dedicated to the good Fortune of the Emperor
<HI>Trajan,</HI> the Son of <HI>Nerva.</HI></P>
<P>The Metropolitans House adjoyns to the Church,
to which he goes under a Covert. In this same
Passage, which also serves for a <HI>Portico</HI> to the said
Church, is to be seen the Tomb of an <HI>English</HI> Gen|tleman,
who going to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> fell sick of
the Pestilence in the Island of <HI>Tenedos,</HI> and died
before he could arrive at <HI>Heraclea,</HI> where he was
Interred in the Year 1627. as appears by the <HI>Greek</HI>
and <HI>Latin</HI> Epitaph upon his Tomb. There is no
question to be made, but that the <HI>Bishop</HI> and the
<HI>Cadi</HI> shar'd the best part of that unfortunate
Gentlemans <HI>Viaticum,</HI> to obtain the favour of being
Interred in a place so secure as the Entry into the
Church, a place the most Honourable and decent
in those parts, in regard that neither the <HI>Greeks</HI>
nor any of the Eastern Christians bury their dead
in Churches.</P>
<P>This Cathedral Church of <HI>Heraclea</HI> is one of
the fairest in all <HI>Greece.</HI> When I say one of the
fairest Churches of <HI>Greece,</HI> it is not to be imagin'd
that I extol it for a Pompous piece of Architecture.
Only this it is that makes it so remarkable, that
it is a great pile wrought out of a large Pane of
one part of the Wall of the City and the Remains
of an Ancient Building, which seems to have been
some Tower, over which they have raised a hand|some
Roof that covers the Edifice. The inside is
fair and decent, and much better ordered than the
Church belonging to the <HI>Patriarch</HI> of <HI>Constantinople.</HI>
There are also several other Churches in <HI>Heraclea,</HI>
but not in so good repair as this, which is a kind
of Cathedral, and indeed the one half of them
<PB N="48" REF="33">
are altogether deserted and utterly forsaken.
When I came to <HI>Heraclea,</HI> I ask'd whether it were
Holyday, finding so many of the Shops shut up in
several streets. But they told me, they were the
Houses of a great many rich <HI>Heracleotes,</HI> who
were lately dead of the Plague; or else of such
as had forsaken their Houses and their Country
some Years before, unable to endure the Tyranny
of the <HI>Turks,</HI> who continually vexed them with
new Impositions; adding farther, that if the <HI>Turks</HI>
did not relax their Cruelty, there would not in
a short time be one <HI>Greek</HI> Inhabitant left in <HI>He|raclea.</HI>
In regard that since the late severe pro|hibitions
against Wine over all <HI>Turkey,</HI> the poor
<HI>Greeks</HI> had not where withal to make money to
pay their <HI>Karache</HI> or <HI>Tribute,</HI> which they are oblig'd
to have ready upon demand.</P>
<P>Nor is the Condition of all the other Cities of
<HI>Turkey</HI> much different from this, as being all very
thinly inhabited; for besides that the Contagion,
which always ravages in one part or other of the
<HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, sweeps away vast Numbers day|ly
of the Grand <HI>Signor</HI>'s Subjects, the Politicks
of that Prince are not so clear-witted as to ap|prehend,
that <HI>Polygamie,</HI> which he and his Laws
allow, is not sufficient to replenish an Empire, so
vast as his, with People. A little more Humanity
and less Tyranny would be much more conducing
to that purpose, than all the Variety of Women
in his <HI>Serraglio,</HI> and which his <HI>Basha</HI>'s and other
Subjects also maintain. But they are so far from
Humanity and Moderation, that upon the least
failor of exacted Tribute, there is no more than a
word and a blow: Cudgels, Chains and Imprison|ment,
are the only kindnesses they must expect
who are not prepared to satisfy the Collector's
<PB N="49" REF="33">
demand. More than this, the <HI>Mahometans</HI> are so
wedded to their opinion concerning Predestination,
that it will not permit them to erect Hospitals or
Alms-houses either for the Cure of the sick, or any
other public places where the Infected, or such as
come from Infected places, are usually oblig'd
in other Countries to keep their <HI>Quarantaines,</HI> be|fore
they are admitted to Trade in public. On
the other side, with them, a person no sooner dyes
of the Plague, but they presently carry his Cloaths
and Goods to the Market, where he that wants,
purchases what he has occasion for, and many times
loses his life e're he has had the pleasure to enjoy
his Bargain: Which though it be a misfortune
that frequently happens to several, yet the <HI>Turks</HI>
never take any notice of it. And as for the poor
<HI>Greeks,</HI> though they are sufficiently sensible of the
mischief, yet the sottish Religion of their Masters
will not permit them any other kindness than to
perish with them.</P>
<P>The present Trade of <HI>Heraclea</HI> is not very great;
nor are the Vessels which visit their Haven any
other for the most part, than such as are driven in
by stress of weather; as happen'd to the Ship
wherein I was a Passenger, which was constrained
to put into Harbour, by a furious Wind full North.
But for such as come to take in their Lading there,
they are but few; and yet they have plenty of
Cotton, Olives, dry and green Fruits, Hides and
Wool. I arriv'd at <HI>Heraclea</HI> just at the time when
they gather'd their Cotton, which made me curious
to see in what manner they did it. It is well known
that Cotton is the product of a Seed black without
and white within, about the bigness of a little
Pea. This they Sow in <HI>Iune,</HI> that it may come to
perfection in <HI>September,</HI> or <HI>October</HI> at farthest. In
<PB N="50" REF="34">
which time the plant grows up generally as high
as an ordinary Shrubb, bearing a leaf not much un|like
that of Plantain. But whether it grow much
or little, it bears always several Cods full of Cot|ton,
in the midst of which lyes the seed. Now
when these Cods are fully ripe, they open like an <HI>E|mony</HI>
flower, and discover the Cotton enclosed, which
is separated from the Seed by two little Rol|lers
like those of a Gravers Printing Press, between
which the Cotton passes, leaving the Seed behind.</P>
<P>This City has been Honoured by the death of
several Martyrs, liberal of their blood in defence of
the Christian faith. Of which number were St.
<HI>Felix, Clement,</HI> and <HI>Philemon.</HI></P>
<P>Between <HI>Heraclea</HI> and <HI>Constantinople,</HI> there is at
present nothing remarkable; only three or four
Villages discover themselves upon the Coast of
<HI>Thrace,</HI> which might formerly perhaps have been
places of note, as seems to appear by their heaps
of Ruin'd Houses. But at this time, were <HI>Selivrea, Be|vados,
Grand Pont,</HI> and <HI>Sancto Stephano,</HI> all put toge|ther,
they would not make an ordinary Town. So
that I shall say little more of this coast of <HI>Thrace;</HI>
only since I have made mention of <HI>Grand Pont,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
cannot pass by a generous Action of Monsieur <HI>Vail|lant,</HI>
Physician and Antiquarie to the King of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>We embark'd together at <HI>Smirna</HI> for <HI>Constanti|nople,</HI>
in a Turkish <HI>Saick,</HI> that stopp'd to unlade part
of her Goods at <HI>Grand-pont,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI> call
<HI>Boujouc Tchesmega,</HI> or <HI>Boujouc Kupri.</HI> During the
time that the Vessel stay'd in the Harbour, Mon|sieur
<HI>Vaillant</HI> went ashore, to see what pieces of An|tiquity
he could discover: And passing along
through one of the publick streets, he saw a young
<HI>Venetian,</HI> chain'd like a fugitive slave, to the end,
that his Master might come and have him again upon
<PB N="51" REF="34">
claim, or if he had no Master, that then they who
had stopp'd him might make their best advantage
of him. This <HI>Venetian</HI> had been made a slave during
the War of <HI>Candy,</HI> and sold to a <HI>Turk</HI> in the Coun|try,
by whom, as he afterwards confessed, he had
not been ill us'd. But notwithstanding his Patrons
mildness, that natural desire of Liberty, and to
return to his Native Country, which is fixed in all
men, had over perswaded him to seek out all the
ways imaginable to free himself. Thereupon hea|ring
of a new <HI>Venetian</HI> Embassador that was upon
his way to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> he resolv'd to lay hold of
an opportunity that seem'd to promise him so
fairly. And indeed the success of his first attempts
were answerable to his wishes. For his Master, con|scious
of the kindness and affection which he had
shew'd him all along, had not the least mistrust of
him; and with that confidence sent him with a
Letter to <HI>Adrianople,</HI> which was about two days
Journey from his House. The <HI>Venetian</HI> was so
just as to carry his Masters Letter to <HI>Adr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">ople,</HI> but
for the answer his Master might fetch it himself. For
he had a farther journy to go, which was to <HI>Constan|tinople,</HI>
whither he made all the hast he could, and by
the privatest Roads, and the most by-ways he could
find out. Nevertheless he could not Travel with that
secresie, but that at length he was stopp'd. For it
is the custom in <HI>Turkie,</HI> to stop as a fugitive slave, any
person that Travells alone i'the Country, or comes
to any Village without Company, and not to let
him pass if he cannot produce a Letter from his
Master to justify his being sent, or that he has given
him his Liberty. Neither of which the <HI>Venetian</HI>
had to shew that were real, and which to counterfeit
in <HI>Turkie</HI> is a thing extreamly hazardous and dange|rous.
Thereupon he was apprehended, and chain'd
<PB N="52" REF="35">
to a Post in the public street, where he remain'd
for three days together; notwithstanding all the
feign'd excuses he could make. The poor <HI>Venetian</HI>
was in a thousand doubts, sometimes he feared lest
his Master should hear of him, and then he knew the
severity of his punishment no less than five hundred
drubs with a battoon upon the soles of his feet, with
a thousand other hardships, at the discretion of his
Patron. Sometimes he was afraid they would sell
him to some other Master, that would not be so kind
to him as his other Patron had been. But in the
midst of these thoughts&punc; the Arrival of Monsieur
<HI>Vaillant</HI> prov'd his deliverance. For as soon as the
miserable Captive perceiv'd him, he threw himself
at Monsieur <HI>Vaillants</HI> feet, imploring his com|passion,
and to relieve him from the misfortune he
was fall'n into, either of being found out again by
his former Patron, or sold to a new Master, There|upon
Monsieur <HI>Vaillant</HI> commiserating the lamen|table
condition of the miserable Captive, demanded
him from the hands of those that detain'd him, as
one that was a friend to his Master, whom he pre|tended
to know, and call'd by a fictitious name; and
to add the more credit to what he said, he readily
paid what mony they who put the imbargo upon
the <HI>Venetian's</HI> heels demanded, and so carrying his
purchase along with him to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> there
like a generous Christian gave him his full liberty
frankly and freely.</P>
<P>Having now taken a view of all the <HI>Propontic</HI>
shoare, it behoves us to speak something of the
Islands that are in the <HI>Propontis</HI> it self; of which the
largest, and those which you first meet with, are
the Islands of <HI>Marmara.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Isles of Marma|ra.</NOTE> They lye to the right, as
you leave <HI>Galipoli,</HI> about ten Leagues off in the Sea,
steering, if you desire to make them North East and
<PB N="53" REF="35">
by East. In the Winter some Vessels bear away
to the South of these Islands, by reason of the
South and South-East Winds that blow hard at that
Season; in the Summer they keep the Channel directly
for <HI>Constantinople.</HI> These Islands are Four in number,
Two large ones, One of a lesser extent, and the O|ther
very small. They lye very near one another,
and are well peopl'd. The biggest of these Islands
which is the most Northerly, is about twelve Lea|gues
in circumference, having for its chief City
<HI>Marmara,</HI> from whence it derives its name, toge|ther
with several other Villages, and among the
rest <HI>Galioni</HI> and <HI>Crastio,</HI> with some few Convents
and Hermitages, inhabited by <HI>Caloyers</HI> or Re|ligious
<HI>Greeks,</HI> who pass their time with great
content in those quiet Retirements.</P>
<P>The largest next to <HI>Marmara,</HI> lying to the East
is call'd <HI>Avezia,</HI> containing one Borough of the same
name, and two Villages, <HI>Aloni</HI> and <HI>Arabkioi,</HI> or the
<HI>Villages</HI> of the <HI>Arabians.</HI> The third Island, not so
large as either of the former, is call'd <HI>Coutalli,</HI> con|taining
also a Borough of the same name; and the
fourth, which is the smallest of all, by the name of
<HI>Gadaro,</HI> is not however without several pleasant
Habitations, and some few Religious houses of the
<HI>Caloyers.</HI> These four Islands are seated on a good
Climate, lying in 38 degrees and some 35 minutes of
Northern Latitude, to the South-East of <HI>Heraclea,</HI>
abounding in Corn, Wine, Fruit, Pasturage, and
Cattel, besides the convenience of excellent Fishing,
of which the Inhabitants however make little
other advantage than for their own use, in regard
that <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and all the other Cities seated
upon the <HI>Propontis,</HI> are sufficiently stor'd by their
own Inhabitants, so that they have no occasion to be
beholding to their Neighbours.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="36">They who are bound from these Islands to <HI>Con|stantinople,</HI>
must steer their course North, and the
contrary from <HI>Constantinople</HI> to <HI>Marmara.</HI> I have
Sail'd it in less than Twelve Hours with a
good Wind, though it be reckoned about Forty
Leagues.</P>
<P>At the extremity of the <HI>Propontis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iles of the Princes.</NOTE> before you
bear up to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> you meet with a little
cluster of Islands, which the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Papa Adasi;</HI>
the <HI>Greeks, Papa donisia,</HI> or the Isles of the <HI>Monks;</HI>
the <HI>Europeans,</HI> the <HI>Islands</HI> of the <HI>Pope,</HI> or the <HI>Islands</HI>
of the <HI>Princes.</HI> These Islands would be most plea|sing
Summer Ritirements, and Spring-Gardens for
evening Recreations, were they in the hands of the
<HI>Christians,</HI> or they Masters of <HI>Constantinople;</HI> every
one would there desire to have his Country Habita|tion.
For they lye not above three or four Leagues
from <HI>Constantinople,</HI> which is not above an hour and
a half or two hours sail at the most. The <HI>Europe|ans</HI>
who live in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> as also those of <HI>Pera,</HI>
and the other <HI>Greeks,</HI> make these Islands, generally
the Randevouzes for their Recreation. But yet
such is their unhappiness to be so near Neighbours
to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> that that which otherwise might
prove to their advantage, becomes the cause of their
misfortune. For lying at so small distance from
the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tropolis, when any of the <HI>Ianizaries,</HI> or
Drunken <HI>Turks,</HI> have a mind to divert themselves,
they retire to these Islands, to the end they may
have the more liberty to troul about their Cups,
without being taken notice of. For though the
<HI>Turks</HI> rarely drink Wine, yet they love to take their
full swinge when they can get a private conveni|ence,
not believing they have so much as tasted it,
unless they can feel the effects of it in their heads or
their Stomachs three days after. To this purpose
<PB N="55" REF="36">
away they go to these Islands, inhabited only by
Christian <HI>Greeks,</HI> with a design to bouze it about
briskly, and when they are got Drunk, they com|mit
all the disorders that their inflam'd heads can
devise. They swear at the poor <HI>Greeks,</HI> beat 'em,
and seize for their own proper use, (as Lords of
the Mannour) whatsoever they have a mind to. 'Tis
true they seldom kill any one, because Murder is
so strictly and severely punish'd all over <HI>Turkie,</HI> the
Murderers being always hang'd in the same place
where the Murder is committed: but they break into
the poor peoples Gardens, and make more havock
of the Vines, Plants and Fruit Trees, than so many
Swine, not sparing what ever comes in their way,
so that the Poor creatures have no encouragement
either to till, plant or sow. Which is the reason that
those fertil and delightful Islands lye almost neg|lected
and unmanur'd, like so many barren desarts.
Only the <HI>Caloyers</HI> plant about their Religious Hou|ses
sufficient for themselves, and to entertain such
Travellers as come to visit them; to whom they
will also permit the liberty of Eating Flesh in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ir
Convents, so they bring it along with them,
though themselves are by their Order confin'd only
to the Fruits of the Earth and Fish; of which they
have the convenience to make a plentiful Provi|sion.</P>
<P>The <HI>Coloyers</HI> are of the Order of St. <HI>Basil,</HI> as
are also those of Mount <HI>Athos,</HI> or the <HI>Holy Mountain:</HI>
and indeed all the rest of the <HI>Caloyers</HI> all over
<HI>Greece</HI> are under the same Rules, and wear the
same Habit: You shall not hear a word among
them of Reforming their first Institution. They
have not chang'd any thing of their Ancient manner
of living or Habit. Their vestments are the same
as formerly. They have neither added nor di|minish'd
<PB N="56" REF="37">
any thing to make any distinction one
from the other; but maugre the desolation of
their livelyhoods, and the long series of time, they
have preserved their Constit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tions entire, without
suffering any alteration or deviation. They live
a very retir'd life, and very poorly; they never
eat any flesh; and besides this continual abstinence,
they keep four Lents in the year, not reckoning in
several other Fasts and Vigils which the <HI>Greek</HI>
Church most devoutly observes; in so much that
let them be what they will, Secular or Ecclesiastic,
Rich or Poor, sick or in health, though never so
pressing necessity urge it, they dare not at those
times so much as tast either Butter, Fish or Eggs.
The <HI>Armenians</HI> also forbid the use of Oyl; nor does
any person so much as think of desiring a Dispen|sation,
which indeed would never be granted, unle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s
they could alledge some invincible reason, and
then they must also give a very con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">iderable Alms
to the Church.</P>
<P>But although the great number of Fasts and
Lents which the Eastern Christians, as well as the
<HI>Caloyers</HI> observe, causes them to spend three Quar|ters
of the year in a kind of mortifying hunger, yet
is not all this their great Devotion any obstruction,
but that they can find a way to entertain those that
visit them in their Lents, with Ragou's and dainties
no less various then delightful to the Appetite: So
true is the <HI>Italian</HI> Proverb, <HI>Trovata la Legge trovato
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">' inganno. The Law once known, you may easily find
away to elude it.</HI> For though they give ye no Wine,
yet they supply that defect with Strong-waters,
Coffee, Sherbet, and other made drinks as pleasing.
They that scruple to eat Fish, spread their Tables
with Oysters, Periwincles, and such other kind of
Shel-fish, with Pottages, Caveare, Botargo, and
<PB REF="38">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB REF="39">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="57" REF="40">
other compositions made of Eggs and Roes
of Fish, much more delightful and pleasing
to the Palate, than the Fish themselves, and on
which a good stomach may feed heartily without
fear or danger of troublesome Bones; and if the
<HI>Armenians</HI> will not admit either Oyl or Butter in
their Sauces, yet they make use of Almonds, Pista|ches,
Nuts and other Fruits, and Kernells bruised in
Morters, which being set over a Chafing-dish, sup|ply
the want, and are much better than our Butter.
In short, they who are most bigotted to the obser|vance
of these Lents, make such a confusion of fee|ding
and fasting, that they think it no sin to be
munching and exercising their Grinders all day
long between meales, provided they abstain from
flesh, fish, eggs, butter and oyl.</P>

<P>LEaving these Islands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. II.</NOTE> of which I shall say no
more, because that others have bestow'd great
pains upon them already, you begin to approach
near <HI>Constantinople,</HI> which you behold to the left

reach from the Castle of the seven Towers to the
Point of the Serraglio; after which you must steer
to the North-East, to double the point of the <HI>Serra|glio,</HI>

For my own part, when I arriv'd there the
first time, methought I was entring into an Inchanted
Island. I found my self in the midst of three great
Arms of the Sea, of which the one flows from the
North-East, the other lyes toward the North-West,
and the third, to which both those contribute their
waters, discharges it self into the round Receptacle
of the <HI>Propontis.</HI> These three great Arms of the
Sea, as far as you can see, employ their Waves on
both sides, to wash the shoars of several parcells of
Land, insensibly rising into a great number of Hills
cover'd with Houses of pleasure, Gardens and
<HI>Kioscs.</HI> And the nearer these three great Arms of
the Sea waft ye to the City, the more increases the
infinite number of Houses. They appear all toge|ther
one above another, in form of an Amphithe|ater,
so that they all afford the benefit of a most
beautiful Prospect.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="41">In the midst of those houses, variously Painted
appears an incredible number of Domo's, Cupola's,
Steeples and Towers, much higher than the ordi|nary
Buildings. All those <HI>Domo's</HI> are cover'd with
Lead, as also the Steeples, the Spires of which are
Gilded: And the verdure of the Cypress and
other Trees, abounding in a prodigious number of
Gardens, contribute infinitely to the pleasing
confusion of various colours that charm the eyes of
all that approach near to the City. The multitude
of Vessels that make as it were a Crown round
about the Port, without encumbring the middle,
appears like a spacious Circle of lofty Trees, de|priv'd
of their Leaves on purpose because they
should not hide those beautiful Objects that lye
behind them. And the vast number of <HI>Kaicks,</HI> Gon|dola's
and little Boats, which is said to amount
to above Sixteen Thousand, which are con|tinually
in motion from all parts, some under Sail,
some Row'd with Oars, for the convenience of the
Inhabitants, seems to represent to the Spectators
of so lovely an Amphitheater, the continual diver|tisement
of a Naval Combat. In short, when you
are in the middle of the Harbour of this great City,
which way soever you turn your eye, you cannot
but admire how favourable Nature has been to it, in
making choice of whatsoever she thought might
conduce to the Glory of its situation.</P>
<P>Seeing then it has such great advantages, and
those peculiar to it self, we need not wonder that
<HI>Constantine</HI> the Great, so easily quitted the delights
of <HI>Rome,</HI> and Transported the Seat of his Empire
to <HI>Byzantium,</HI> and that he call'd it by his own name;
nor indeed is there any other City so proper to
command the Universe. With one glance of her eye
she beholds the two most lovely parts of the whole,
<PB N="60" REF="42">
and in less than a quarter of an hour can send her
Orders from the one part of the World where she
is seated, to the other. Which therefore seems to
make so near an approach to her lofty Towers on
purpose to receive her Commands, and submit to
her Obedience. So that had Art and Nature con|sulted
together, to form a Place where Beauty and
Plenty should equally contend, they never could
have been more successful, than in the adornment
of that where <HI>Constantinople</HI> stands.</P>
<P>The Soyl produces all sorts of Fruits, as pleasing
to the Eye, as delicious to the tast, so that there
is nothing to be desired either necessary, or super|abounding
for the support of human life. Their
Fresh and Salt Waters furnish them with all sorts of
Commodities, which it is possible for an Element so
advantageous to mankind to afford them. Fish,
not to speak of Oysters, in so great abundance
stores their Markets, that I know not whether it
may not be one part of satisfaction to Curiosity
for that very reason to view a City so well furnished
with provision: You shall see them frisking every
moment above Water. But whether to admire the
Glory of that City, or to breath in the sweetness
of the Air, be more pleasant, is a question. The vast
plenty of Fowl is not to be imagin'd; yet the
havock which they make Mornings and Evenings
among the Gardens and neighbouring Hills, suffici|ently
declare the fruitfulness of the Climate in their
production. Nor are they less stor'd with those
<HI>Amphibious</HI> winged Creatures, that live sometimes
upon Land, sometimes in the Water, and sometimes
in the Air, to shew that all those three Elements
are at <HI>Constantinople</HI> in their Highest perfection.
Even the Fire it self, not enduring to be confined
within the smaller hearths of so fair a City, breaks
<PB N="61" REF="42">
forth oft-times into most violent constagrations, as
if become capable of jealousie, and not being able
to render it self sufficiently remarkable by its or|dinary
uses, it rather chose to shew it self dreadful
by its effects, than to be the onely Element idl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
and inglorious in that City, while all the rest seem
to have their Thrones at <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P>This Prodigality of Nature caused the Emperour
<HI>Iustinian,</HI> to believe that it behov'd men rather to
abandon all the rest of the World to come and live
at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> than suffer so delightful a place
to be one single day without Inhabitants, as it has
been the fate of several other great Cities. And
upon this consideration it was, that he chang'd it's
name of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and gave it the Appellation
of the <HI>Eternal City,</HI> as appears by that Law of his,
<HI>si qui quinta cap. de divers. praed. urb. tit.</HI> 69.
Neither is <HI>Constantinople</HI> the onely name which this
City has born, nor yet the last; having had almost
as many Names as Masters; while all that have
rul'd within her Walls, either as Kings or Tyrants,
have all had their fancies to change her Name as
well as her Fortune. In the first place it was call'd
<HI>Chrysoceras,</HI> or <HI>Horn of Gold.</HI> Perhaps from that
plenty and abundance which some of the <HI>Thracian</HI>
Shepherds found upon that Out-let of Land upon
which it is Seated; or for the advantage of the
place by reason of its Situation, and the exteriour
Figure of it, which represents the shape and sub|stance
of <HI>Amalthea's</HI> Horn, usually call'd the Horn
of Plenty: This fell out in the Year of the World
3286. which was within the 22<HI>d. Olympiad,</HI> in the
Reigns of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Rather</HI> Manasses</NOTE> <HI>Ezechias</HI> and <HI>Numa Pompilius;</HI> six
hundred fourscore and ten years before the Birth
of Christ. After this first erecting of certain Shep|herds
Cottages at <HI>Chrysoceras,</HI> the number of In|habitants,
<PB N="62" REF="43">
charm'd with the Situation of the Place,
increas'd so fast, that in a little time it grew to be
a considerable Borough, to which they gave the
name of <HI>Acropolis,</HI> or the City of the Point or
<HI>Promontory,</HI> and afterwards that of <HI>Lygos.</HI> Nor
was it long after that <HI>Byzis, Byzas, Bysantus</HI> or <HI>By|santa</HI>
(for such is the variety among several Authors)
carrying thither a Collony of the <HI>Megarians,</HI> call'd
it by his own name <HI>Byzantium,</HI> which continu'd 'till
the Reign of the Emperour <HI>Antonine,</HI> who greatly
added to the Buildings, and call'd it <HI>Antonina.</HI> It
has also born the name of <HI>Anthusa,</HI> afterwards that
of <HI>New Rome,</HI> 'till at length <HI>Constantine</HI> the <HI>Great,</HI>
(who Translated thither the seat of the <HI>Roman</HI> Em|pire,)
enlarg'd it, and to adorn it with a Magnifi|cence
becoming the honour which he had done it,
added his own, and call'd it <HI>Constantinian new Rome,</HI>
which long name was afterwards abridg'd into that
of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> or the City of <HI>Constantine.</HI></P>
<P>Yet had not this new <HI>Constantinian Rome</HI> more
auspicious beginnings of its Grandeur than the An|cient
<HI>Rome:</HI> For if we may believe <HI>Zozimus,</HI> who
was none of <HI>Constantines</HI> greatest Friends, and some
other Authors, the rebuilding of <HI>Constantinople</HI> was
accompany'd with more fatal and ill-boding Omens,
than those of which we read of the laying the Foun|dations
of <HI>Rome.</HI> For those Authors accuse the
Emperour for having put his Wife <HI>Fausta</HI> and his
Son <HI>Crispus</HI> to death, and upon a slighter occasion
than that upon which <HI>Romulus</HI> slew his Brother
<HI>Remus.</HI> But in regard these Accidents happen'd
before <HI>Constantine</HI> became a <HI>Christian,</HI> therefore the
<HI>Greek</HI> Proverb may be said still to hold, <GAP DESC="foreign">,
<HI>a wiser than a wise man may err,</HI>
seeing that it is as impossible for great men to live
without their defects, as for the Sun to shine with|out
<PB N="63" REF="43">
a spot in his glorious Countenance: However
it were, this last name has been of longest continu|ance,
as well among the <HI>Latins,</HI> as other <HI>Christians</HI>
of <HI>Europe;</HI> but as for the <HI>Turks</HI> and other People of
<HI>Asia, Africa</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> they all give it the name
of <HI>Stamboll.</HI> Perhaps from the corruption of the
words <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>to the City,</HI> which was the an|swer,
that the <HI>Greeks</HI> who liv'd near to <HI>Constantinople</HI>
gave to those that ask'd the question, <HI>whither go ye?</HI>
But neither the <HI>Turks</HI> nor any other of the <HI>Eastern</HI>
People, can give any rational accompt of the Ori|ginal
of the word: And therefore it will suffice to
say, that this City is now known to a great num|ber
of People by the name of <HI>Stamboll,</HI> which was
formerly call'd <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P>So then this same <HI>Chrysoceras, Acropolis, Lygos,
Bysantium, Antonina, Anthusa, New Rome, Con|stantinople,</HI>
the <HI>Eternal</HI> City, and <HI>Stamboll,</HI> which
you please to call it, is that famous City, now
seated in the extream part of all <HI>Thrace,</HI> in 41
degrees of Northern Latitude, and 57 degrees of
Longitude. It possesses all that Langet of Land,
that advances towards the discharge of the Channel
of the <HI>Black Sea,</HI> (which is call'd the <HI>Thracian Bos|phorus,</HI>)
into the <HI>Propontis</HI> or Sea of <HI>Marmara.</HI> And
thence extending it self on both sides, formes a
harbour the most secure and commodious for ship|ping,
and the most abounding in all sorts of Fish,
of any in the world. But now not to say any thing
what this great City formerly was, which others
have sufficiently done before me, and for that all
that has been already written, is no more than
what has been taken from the obscure passages of
certain ancient Authors; I shall onely give a short
accompt of what it is at present, the Reader ha|ving
the satisfaction of the Draught, Fig. II. p. 57.
<PB N="64" REF="44">
which is as true a Representation of the Original,
as the bigness of the Volume would permit. This
Peninsula upon which <HI>Constantinople</HI> is seated, be|gins
to forsake the Continent, and advance it self
between two Seas, where stands the Castle of the
<HI>Seven Towers,</HI> and so runs on to the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> and
thence winding about towards the Continent again,
makes a large half Circle, which forms the Haven
that belongs to the City, 'till you come to a small
River which discharges it self into it, and their
mixing its own fresh stream with the salt Water,
renders the Haven, both pleasant and commodious.
Near to the Mouth of this little River, (where
lies the Burying place belonging to the <HI>Iews,</HI>) upon
the back part of the City, runs almost in a direct
line, a double flat wall strengthen'd with several
Square Towers, which reaches to the Castle of
the Seven Towers, so that the Figure of the City
is a Triangular Oxygone, resembling a Harp, or
<HI>Cornucopia,</HI> the gibbous part of which lies next to
the firm Land, and the two Horns are wash'd by
the Channel of the <HI>Black Sea.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Circuit of <HI>Constantinople</HI> is about
four Leagues. That is to say, from the <HI>Seven</HI>
Towers to the Point of the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> formerly
call'd <HI>Acropolis,</HI> may be reckon'd more than a
League and a half. From that Point of the <HI>Serraglio</HI>
to <HI>Aivansarai,</HI> which is a part of the Suburbs
next to the <HI>Iews</HI> Burying place, may be accounted
above a League and a quarter, and from thence to
the <HI>Seven</HI> Towers somewhat more than a League.</P>
<P>This latter part of the City lies toward the Con|tinent;
but the other two are wash'd on both sides
by the Sea. This whole circuit is encompass'd
with a Wall, Fortify'd on the out side with square
and round Towers; on the inside, the Houses of
<PB N="65" REF="44">
the City joyn to it: The City has Entrance at
Eighteen Gates, of which Five stand next to the
<HI>Propontis,</HI> with their Sally-ports and descents; Six
toward the Court, with their descents and Sally-Ports
in the same manner; and Seven stand toward
the Continent, where the Walls and Motes are dou|ble.
Which latter Walls were built by one <HI>Cyrus,</HI>
who was formerly Governour of the City, in the
Reign of <HI>Theodosius</HI> the younger. This piece of
work gave such satisfaction to the people, that
they made public rejoicings, and Eulogies in honour
of that same great Lord, and extoll'd him to a very
high degree. Among the rest, they said, <HI>that
though it were true, that</HI> Constantine <HI>had built the
City, yet it was Cyrus that had enlarg'd and re-edify'd
it;</HI> and more than all this, they were about to have
chang'd the Name of the City from that of <HI>Con|stantinopolis,</HI>
into that of <HI>Cyropolis.</HI> Which <HI>Theodo|sius</HI>
observing, began to grow jealous, and to recom|pence
<HI>Cyrus</HI> for having so well fortify'd and beau|tify'd
the Town, he caus'd him to be shorn, and put
into a Monastery, where he dy'd for very Grief.</P>
<P>The Castle of the <HI>Seven Towers</HI> which joyns
these Walls upon the Land side, to those that look
toward the <HI>Propontis,</HI> is the first building of remark
in <HI>Constantinople.</HI> It may be properly call'd the
<HI>Bastile</HI> of <HI>Stamboll,</HI> in regard it had the same Origi|nal,
and serves now for the same use as the <HI>Bastile</HI>
of <HI>Paris.</HI> For formerly it was no more than one
of the City Gates, compos'd of Four large Towers.
This Gate was call'd the Golden Gate, either because
the Ornaments with which it was embellish'd were
gilt, or else because all the Triumphs and Magnifi|cence
of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> at the time of solemn Entries
and Receptions, were always wont to pass thorow
this same Gate. Among the number of all which
<PB N="66" REF="45">
Pompous Entries was that which Pope <HI>Iohn</HI> the
first made, who was receiv'd with all the pomp and
spendour imaginable, not so much for that he was
sent by <HI>Theodoric,</HI> or <HI>Thierry</HI> King of <HI>Italy</HI> to the
Emperour <HI>Iustin</HI> the old, but for that as he pass'd
through this Golden Gate, the holy Prelate had
restor'd a Blind man to his Sight; and because he
also took a Journey to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> to reconcile
the differences between the Catholics and the <HI>Ar|rians,</HI>
whose Party <HI>Theodoric</HI> upheld. At which in|terview
between the Pope and the Emperour it was,
that <HI>Iustin</HI> began the custom that has been observ'd
ever since, for the Emperours to receive at the
hands of the Sovereign Pontiff, the Arms and
Ensigns of the Imperial dignity.</P>
<P>To the Four ancient Towers of this Gate, <HI>Maho|met</HI>
the Second, who took the City of <HI>Constantino|ple,</HI>
added three more, to make it a Castle, wherein
he and some of his Successors kept the greatest part
of their Trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ure: But now it is no more than an
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">onourable Prison, where the Grand Signor shuts
up his Slaves of quality, and other Prisoners of
State, who if any of them happen to be Christians,
they are permitted the liberty to have their Priests
to say Mass in a small Chappel belonging to the
Prison, as also to give them the Sacrament freely.
Or if any of these Prisoners chance to be a Knight of
<HI>Malta,</HI> or some other person of Quality, they are
likewise suffer'd to walk about the City, or to go
into the Country for some days, provided some
Embassadour, or other publick Person, residing at
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> will engage to the <HI>Aga</HI> of the <HI>Seven
Towers</HI> for his forth-coming, when the <HI>Aga</HI> shall
have occasion to send for him. This civility of the
<HI>Turk</HI> is a great consolation to such as their misfor|tunes
have enclos'd within the Seven Towers.
<PB N="67" REF="45">
Without which it would be a grievous thing for
a man to find himself shut up for no offence com|mitted,
and condemned to perpetual Imprison|ment,
such as is that of the <HI>Seven Towers</HI> for a
Knight of <HI>Malta</HI> who is taken Roving upon the
Sea: For as for those that are taken in War, they
are Releas'd again upon the conclusion of Peace. In
this Castle it was that the unfortunate Prince
<HI>Sultan Osman</HI> miserably ended his days in the year
1622. <HI>Hussein Bassa</HI> was also there strangled, and
lyes buryed in a Tomb in the Garden belonging
to the Prison. And out of this Prison it was that
Monsieur <HI>de Beaujeu</HI> made his Escape, as we have
already related, after he had endur'd Sixteen
years Imprisonment, and large summs offer'd for
his Ransom, which would not be taken.</P>
<P>Without the Walls of the Castle, near one of the
Towers, which compos'd in former times the
<HI>Golden Gate,</HI> lye two large Sculptures of white
Marble; the one representing a man asleep, and
resting his head upon his arm, and a Goddess De|scending
from Heaven with a Taper in her hand.
Which may perhaps be rightly thought to be <HI>En|dymion,</HI>
and the <HI>Moon</HI> coming to visit him. The
other, if I mistake not, represents the Nine Muses
with the Horse <HI>Pegasus.</HI> Yet neither the one nor
the other, tho pieces well enough wrought, are so
exactly done, as to oblige an Artist to say, as some
of our<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">Travellers do, that we have nothing in
<HI>Europe</HI> that approaches near to the delicacy of those
Pieces; or that there is any such superexcellent de|sign
or spirit in the figures, which might deserve any
extraordinary present, either to the <HI>Caimacan</HI> or
<HI>Aga;</HI> for leave to carry them away.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="46">
Going by Sea from the Castle of the <HI>Seven
Towers</HI> to the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> you meet with a square
Tower upon the left hand, that stands in the Sea,
distant from the City-wall about twenty paces. The
Inhabitants of the Country call it <HI>Belisarius's</HI> Tower.
Affirming, that it was in this Tower, where that
great and famous Commander, for the recom|pence
of all those signal services which he had
done the Emperour <HI>Iustinian,</HI> in subduing his
ene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ies as well in <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Affrica,</HI> as in <HI>Europe,</HI>
being despoyl'd of all his Estate and Honours, and
reduc'd to the extremity of necessity, after he had
endur'd putting out both his eyes, was at length
shut up, and forc'd for his subsistance, to hang out
a Bag from the Grate of his Chamber, and cry to
the Passengers, <HI>give poor</HI> Belisarius <HI>a Farthing, whom
envy and no crime of his hath depriv'd of his eyes.</HI> Near
to the place where stands this Tower, was for|merly
the Haven where <HI>Theodosius, Arcadius</HI> and
their Successors kept their Galleys. A little above
and over against which Haven, was formerly a large
<HI>Piazza,</HI> in the midst of which stands the famous
Historical <HI>Pillar,</HI> the upper part whereof is still to
be seen; but the lower part is so surrounded with
Houses built upon it, that neither the Pedestal nor
the Basis of the Pillar can be discover'd. It is all of
Marble, encompass'd with figures which are very
good Workmanship, representing a certain expedi|tion
of <HI>Arcadius.</HI> However they are not done by
the hand of so good an Artist, as the figures upon
<HI>Trajans</HI> Column at <HI>Rome.</HI> Yet it is much higher
than that, and more room within, with a pair of
Stairs quite up to the top: But at present 'tis
almost impossible to obtain the favour of going
up.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="46">
Nevertheless, there was a certain young Travel|ler,
whom I will not name, more fortunate than
wise, who some years since had obtain'd the liberty
to get up, but when he was at the Top, he was so
indiscreet as to shew himself openly, contrary to
the cautions which were given him. More than that,
nothing would serve him but that he must write
his name upon the top of the Pillar, and flourish his
Handkerchief at the end of his stick. All that walk'd
the streets of that quarter, and all that liv'd in the
Neighbourhood, were strangely supriz'd to per|ceive,
contrary to custome, a fellow mounted upon
the Top of the Pillar, but more especially when
they perceiv'd him to be a <HI>Frank,</HI> with a Hat upon
his head. Immediately all the street was full of
people, and all that quarter of the City in a
Hubbub. Some ran in heaps together, out of
curiosity to behold that same new figure, believing
it to be the soul of him that first erected the
Column, and that he was come to reassume the place
which his Statute had possess'd before: Others in|cens'd
with jealousie, lest the <HI>Frank</HI> should prie
into their houses, and discover the privacies of their
Wives, ran out of their Habitations to see who 'twas
that was so bold as to get up to the top of
the Pillar, believing the <HI>Frank</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ad taken his
stand there, for his better discovery of their Wo|men,
and to enable him the better to make his choice.</P>
<P>With these imaginations, and exagitations of
Passion, away they flew to the Pillar, beseig'd the
House that had given entrance to the <HI>Frank,</HI> and
having fetch'd him down with a vengeance, away
they hall'd him to the house of the <HI>Soubachi,</HI> or
Commissary of that quarter. Not forgetting as
they went along, to mall him with their fists, and
<PB N="70" REF="47">
knock their <HI>Papouches</HI> or shoes about his ears.
Presently the <HI>Falaque</HI> and the <HI>Battoons</HI> were brought
forth, and the poor <HI>Frank</HI> had pay'd dear for his
curiosity, at least fifty good drubbs upon the soles
of his feet, if his Embassadour, who was immedi|ately
advertiz'd of the accident, had not sent with
all speed an Interpreter with a present to the <HI>Sou|bachi,</HI>
and to tell him withal, that the <HI>Frank</HI> who
had ascended the Column, was a stranger, who
did not understand the custome of the Country, and
therefore was not so much to be blam'd as the <HI>Turk</HI>
who had given him admission: And that he ought
to take the imprudence of a stranger into considera|tion,
and for the Embassadors sake to pardon a
fault committed out of weakness and folly, not
out of design. The Rhetoric of the Present at
length prevail'd, so that the indiscreet <HI>Frank</HI> was set
at liberty, and the poor Porter of the Pillar receiv'd
the payment in full which the <HI>Frank</HI> should have
had.</P>
<P>This Pillar is to be seen at a good distance out at
Sea. But for the Haven that lay over against it,
there is now no sign remaining that ever there was
one; no more than of that other Haven, somewhat
nearer the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> which <HI>Iulian</HI> the <HI>Apostate</HI> built
and call'd by his own name, the <HI>Iulian</HI> Harbour,
afterwards Port <HI>Sophia,</HI> because it answer'd to the
Piazza, where <HI>Sancta Sophia</HI> was built.</P>
<P>As you approach nearer to the Port, still coasting
along the walls next the <HI>Propontis,</HI> you meet with
nothing considerable to stop your <HI>Caic,</HI> or little
Vessel, till you come near the Serraglio Garden, of
which I shall say the less, for that the Reader, by
casting his eye upon the <HI>Draught,</HI> Fig. 3. may disco|ver
more clearly and without any trouble, all that
concerns that out-side of this famous Palace, than
<PB N="71" REF="47">
a tedious relation in words; the in-side being only
known to those that are enclos'd within it.</P>
<P>Near to the place where stands the <HI>Kiosc</HI> ap|pertaining
to the <HI>Bostangis-Bachy,</HI> there stands a
Fountain to which the <HI>Greeks</HI> pay a most singular
devotion all the year long, especially upon the
day of Christs <HI>Transfiguration,</HI> at which time they
throng to this Fountain, which they call <GAP DESC="foreign">,
or the Fountain of <HI>Sanctification.</HI> There they
wash themselves, cover themselves with the Sand
that lyes about it, and make a long recital of the
extraordinary virtues of that wholesome water.
The <HI>Greeks</HI> have a great number of these miraculous
Fountains. There is hardly a Village or great
Town where you may not meet with one: And
where there are none, which passing through some
vein of Metal, may be thought to partake of some
mineral quality, the <HI>Papa's</HI> or Greek Priests know
how to find out some Well or other near their
Church, which they presently endow with some
admirable virtue, which if it be of no effect to those
that drink it, yet proves not a little profitable to
themselves.</P>
<P>Near to this Fountain stands the <HI>Bostangis Bachi's</HI>
or the chief Gardiner's <HI>Kiosc.</HI> This <HI>Kiosc</HI> is a
large cover'd <HI>Balcone,</HI> erected without the Walls
of the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> jutting out upon the <HI>Propontis,</HI> of
which it overlooks a great part, as also of the
<HI>Thracian Bosphorus.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> take a great delight
in these sort of Buildings, there being few <HI>Serra|glio's</HI>
which have not several belonging to them.
Some in the middle of their Gardens, for the bene|fit
of the fresh Air; others by the Sea-side, where
there is any conveniency; others upon the tops of
their houses like cover'd Platforms. These <HI>Kioscs</HI> are
very proper to recreate the musing humour of the
<PB N="72" REF="48">
<HI>Turks,</HI> who there place themselves upon a low
Couch or <HI>Sopha,</HI> with a Pipe of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> or some
<HI>Flingeans</HI> or dishes of Coffee, and in that posture
they sit sometimes two or three hours in Company
without any discourse, or saying any thing one to
another, but only some few broken half words
utter'd between sip and sip as they take off their
Liquor, which they drink very hot and at several
suppings. This <HI>Kiosc</HI> of the <HI>Bostangis-Bachi</HI> is nothing
so much frequented as the rest. For he being a
person that manages the fourth Employment in the
Empire, has no leisure to take his pleasure, or the
fresh Air in his <HI>Kiosc,</HI> nor to delight himself with the
charming prospect which the situation of his Pavil|lion
affords him. He has business enough to look
after the Grand <HI>Serraglio,</HI> and those other Houses of
Pleasure belonging to the <HI>Sultan,</HI> over all which
he has the superintendency, he also takes care of the
Government of all the Towns and Villages that
stand upon the shoar of the <HI>Bosphorus</HI> and <HI>Propontis,</HI>
which are all under his jurisdiction. Out of the
<HI>Kiosc</HI> there is a passage into the Garden of the <HI>Ser|ragl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o,</HI>
descending through a little door down a short
pair of stairs that are built close by the water-side.</P>
<P>Leaving this <HI>Kiosc,</HI> the first thing you meet with,
keeping still along by the walls, that here encompass
a part of the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> is a great number of Cannons
ready charg'd, and lying levell with the water, to
secure the Entrance into the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> and the Ha|ven,
against any that would pretend to make a for|cible
Entrie. The biggest and most remarkable of
these great Guns, is that which made the last shot
against the City of <HI>Bagdat,</HI> and constrain'd the City,
through the disorder it occasion'd, to surrender to
<HI>Sultan Amurath.</HI> It is look't after with more care
than the rest, as having a Chamber by it self to
<PB N="73" REF="48">
distinguish it from the meaner sort. However
these Cannons, tho they are always loaden, are sel|dom
discharg'd, unless it be upon the first or se|cond
day of <HI>Bairam</HI> Moon, at which time some
are constrain'd to open their loud Throats to give
the Musselmen notice of the approach of their
great Festival, and that <HI>Ramazan</HI> being past,
they are no longer oblig'd to fast. They are
also discharg'd upon some solemn Thanksgiving
days, as when the <HI>Sultan</HI> has Conquer'd some new
Province. At other times they only serve to guard
the Haven and the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> except when any
great Military Officer is condemn'd to be cast into
the Sea, and then they give him a single Gun, just
as they pitch him into the Water.</P>
<P>In the midst of these great Guns stands one of
the four Gates of the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> that is to say, the
Gate which belongs to the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> call'd <HI>Bostangi
Capi.</HI> It is flank'd with two great round Towers,
cover'd each with its proper <HI>Kiosc,</HI> shadowed with
two great <HI>Cypress</HI> Trees, that grow without the <HI>Ser|raglio</HI>
by the Sea side. At the foot of these Towers
stand two <HI>Bostangi</HI> Centinels, who are the <HI>Capigi's</HI>
or Guards of the Gate; so that nothing can be
carry'd in or out, without their permission, who
do not grant it easily, unless it be to the Officers of
the <HI>Serraglio:</HI> Besides, it is through this Gate that
the Sultanesses pass, when the Grand Signor car|ries
them forth to accompany him in his pastimes
upon the Canal of the <HI>Black Sea,</HI> which he fre|quently
does; or when they go to the <HI>Serraglio</HI> at
<HI>Scutari,</HI> which stands directly over against this
Gate. This is that part which was formerly
call'd <HI>Acropolis,</HI> because it is the extream point of
Land upon which <HI>Constantinople</HI> is situate. It now
bears the Name of the Point of the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> or
<HI>Sarai Bourma.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="49">
Having doubl'd the Point of the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> and
pass'd by a small Fountain where the Ships take in
fresh Water, you come to two other <HI>Kioscs,</HI> or
close Pavillions, which Sultan <HI>Solyman</HI> caused to be
built by the Water-side to give his Sultannesses the
pleasure of beholding his Fleets as they Sail'd in
and out, which in his Reign were more numerous
and in better order than now they are. The first
of these <HI>Kioscs</HI> was for the Women, of which he
had a good Number. It is fomewhat higher rais'd
than the other, and the passage to it from the <HI>Ser|raglio</HI>
is such as will not admit the persons passing
to and fro to be seen. It is built upon Arches all
in Length, consisting of three fair Chambers, e|very
one adorn'd with several gilded Alcoves, fur|nish'd
with their Sopha's or low Couches, having
their <HI>Minders,</HI> or Mattresses and Cushions belonging
to them, spread with rich Coverlets of painted
Linnen and Cloth of <HI>Tissue.</HI> These Sopha's or Beds
are placed near the Windows, wherein are Lattices,
through which the Women may see and not be seen;
for should they be seen, it might be as much pre|judicial
to the party discover'd, as to him that
made the discovery.</P>
<P>Yet all these Embellishments in the Sultannesses
<HI>Kiosc,</HI> are nothing in comparison to the great Hall
or Room in the other <HI>Kiosc.</HI> There is nothing in
the World that can be thought to be more noble
and magnificent; whether you look upon the
Marble, the Pillars, the Artificial Water-works,
the stately Tapestries, the Galleries round about
it, the charming Prospect which appears on every side,
or the costly gilded Fretwork of the Ceiling,
which would almost raise a mans thoughts to be|leive
it something of Enchantment. I could never
get liberty to take a draught of it, by reason the
<PB N="75" REF="49">
<HI>Bostangi Bachi</HI>'s coming was still expected when I
was there: and indeed I was not gone above twenty
paces from the Door of the <HI>Kiosc,</HI> but he came
into the Garden, and having perceiv'd me, caus'd me
to be sent for, and demanded of the person that
was with me, what I did there? who made answer,
that in regard I had earnestly desir'd him to let me
see some small part of the infinite Grandeur of the
Master of the World (a Title they ordinarily
give the Grand Signor) he had only given me li|berty
to look into the <HI>Kiosc</HI> through the Key-hole
of the Door. However if a man watch his op|portunity
he may easily get admittance, giving on|ly
a small Present to the Guards. So true is that
in all places that <HI>Horace</HI> tells us,
<Q><L>All ways are safe, all Doors too open wide,</L>
<L>Where Silver undertakes to be the Guide.</L></Q></P>
<P>Now in regard these sort of Buildings are not
erected near the Sea-side, but only for the sake of
those pleasures which the Water affords, there are
always tending near to these <HI>Kioscs</HI> five or six small
Gallies, <HI>Kaics</HI> or other light Vessels, which are still
ready to receive the <HI>Grand Signor</HI> and his Train,
when he has a mind to take his pleasure upon the
Channel. All which little Galleys or Vessels are
richly embellish'd with all sorts of Moresco work,
and painted on all sides. The very Oars and
grapling Hooks have their share of Gilding and
Painting, and all to add to the delight and magni|ficence
of the Grand Signor.</P>
<P>Leaving these <HI>Kioscs,</HI> the Walls that enclose
the <HI>Serraglio</HI> begin to separate from those of the
City, and running up almost as far as the Church of
<HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> they descend toward the <HI>Propontis,</HI> a|bove
the <HI>Bostangi Bachi</HI>'s <HI>Kiosc:</HI> So that the whole
<PB N="76" REF="50">
Circuit of the <HI>Serraglio</HI> is not above a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Note, That in all places of this Book the Leagues are French.</NOTE> League
and a quarter at most. Within which compass
(wherein were contain'd all the first Habitations
of the City of <HI>Byzantium,</HI> formerly call'd <HI>Acropo|lis)</HI>
there is not only room to make a large City,
but people sufficient to render it very populous,
if all those, who may be rather said to be impri|son'd
than to live in this Palace, were suffer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d to u|nite
together like Friends and Neighbours. For
being almost all of them of both Sexes in the flower
of their Age, and chosen out for their sound and
vigorous Constitutions, there is hardly one among
all the <HI>Bostangi's, Capigi's, Achi's,</HI> and <HI>Halvagi's,</HI>
that is to say, Gardeners, Porters, Cooks, Confe|ctioners,
and other Officers, who might not in a
short time become Master of a considerable Family,
were they allow'd to joyn themselves in lawful
Wedlock to the Sultannesses, or <HI>Odalisques,</HI> who
are their Servants. But that same merciless and
relentless Troop of a hundred balck Eunuchs, will
nat permit the unhappy Virgins, nor the unfortu|nate
Officers so much as to look one upon another,
much less to have any discourse together. They
are all under Guard and strict observance, the one
in their Offices, the other in their Apartments. The
Sultannesses never stir without a Convoy of these
envious <HI>Cerberus's,</HI> and that not very often neither,
and but few at a time; and when they have got
leave to take a little Air, all the <HI>Bostangi's</HI> and o|ther
Officers that chance to meet 'em in their
Walk, are oblig'd to get out of the way, and
prostrate themselves with their faces to the Earth.
So that there is scarce a man can say, he ever saw
one of these Sultannesses of the Grand <HI>Serraglio,</HI>
in all the time that he liv'd in the Palace; that pri|viledge
being only reserv'd for the Grand Signor

himself, who will not permit any others to share

a person that has done him some signal peice
of Service, and then he vouchsafes to give him one
of the Sultannesses (which perhaps he has done
with all) in Marriage. A favour which he bestow'd
some few years ago, upon the present Governour of
<HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P>By what I have already said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. III.</NOTE> it may be easily con|ceiv'd
that the Grand <HI>Serraglio</HI> is a <HI>Peninsula</HI> wash'd
on almost every side with the Sea, but encompass'd
round with a flat Wall fortifi'd with several round
and square Towers that stand very near one to a|nother.
On the greatest part of which Towers
every Night is plac'd a Guard of <HI>Azamoglans</HI> or
Tribute Children, not yet capable of any higher
employment, to prevent any Disorders that might
happen either within or without the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> and
to watch the breaking out of any Fires, which do
frequent mischief to <HI>Constantinople.</HI> This Wall
encloses the Gardens belonging to the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> in
the midst of which are the Buildings, rais'd upon
the highest part of the Promontory, formerly call'd
the Land of <HI>Demetrius.</HI></P>
<P>Now it is not to be imagin'd, that the Gardens
of the <HI>Serraglio</HI> are in any manner to compare with
that of the <HI>Thuilleries, Versailles, Fountainbleau,</HI>
nor with the Gardens of several private Gentlemen
in <HI>France;</HI> nor is it to be thought, that the Buildings
which they enclose, can boast of any thing compa|rable
to the <HI>Louvre,</HI> the <HI>Escurial,</HI> or the Magnifi|cent
Palaces of many Christian Princes; for there
is nothing beautiful or regular that appears in all
the outside of the Building. So that if it vaunt it
self over all the Palaces of the Universe, it is only
the Prospect which renders it the most delightful
<PB N="78" REF="54">
Palace in the World. The Gardens observe no
Order, being planted with Cypress, Lawrels, and
other Trees, which are always Green, to shade the
<HI>Sultannesses</HI> (that walk under the protection of
their verdure) from being seen by those of <HI>Galata,</HI>
and the neighbouring parts. As for the Buildings
that compose the Body of the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> they are
rear'd without any regular Order of Architecture,
without any Symmetry or Proportion; only a
great heap of Lodgings and Apartiments, rudely
separated one from the other after the manner of
so many pitch'd Pavillions, and rais'd for the most
part upon great Arches, underneath and on each
side of which, are the Offices, and Lodgings be|longing
to the Officers; for the upper part is only
for the <HI>Sultannesses.</HI> Therefore into these lower
Stories and Offices belonging to the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> it is
lawful for any man that pleases to enter without
being question'd. Farther than that, it is impossi|ble
to see or know what is done in any other part
of the Palace, more especially to give any exact
relation touching the same: It being a Crime which
nothing can expiate but Death, or the loss of that
which makes a man what he is. Neither do I
believe that any Traveller would be willing to pay
so dear for his Curiosity.</P>
<P>This his most Christian Majesty most perfectly
understood, and therefore as I had the honour to
be discours'd by him three times concerning my
Travels, one time among the rest he ask'd me with
a smile, <HI>whether I had not found out a way to get into
those private parts sometimes?</HI> I made him answer,
<HI>No; For that had I done it, it would have cost me tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">
which I esteem'd above the whole Empire of the Grand
Signor.</HI> This suddain and unexpected reply, which
might be variously interpreted, put the King, Mon|sieur
<PB N="79" REF="54">
(the King's Brother) and all the persons of
Quality into such a laughter, that the Queen and
the other Ladies, not having much minded my
last words, ask'd the reason why they all laugh'd
so heartily? Whereupon <HI>Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ieur,</HI> with his ordi|nary
freedom told her, <Q>that his Majesty having
demanded of me, whether I had ever been in the
private Apartments belonging to the <HI>Sultannesses</HI>
of the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> where none but the Eunuchs are
admitted, I had made him answer, <HI>No, for that
it would have cost me that which I valu'd more than all
the Ottoman Empire.</HI></Q> Therefore to explain my self,
and that I might go on with the Relation I was
making of the inviolable Order of the <HI>Serraglio,</HI>
I put it off another way, interpreting my words,
that I would not quit the Christian Religion for the
whole Empire of the Universe, which they must
ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ure that enter into that part of the <HI>Serraglio,</HI>
unless he will sustain the irreparable dammage of
Turkish cruelty and Christian infamy at the same
time.</P>
<P>However notwithstanding it be a thing so diffi|cult
to be admitted into the Womens Lodgings, if
there be any young Traveller, who has a mind to
venture fairly to satisfie his Curiosity in this par|ticular,
his best way will be to make some Jewish
Woman his friend, especially one of those that often
visit the <HI>Sultannesses</HI> to sell them Trifles and Gew|gaws.
Such a one may be easily overcome by a Pre|sent,
(the <HI>Primum Mobile</HI> that does all things in
<HI>Turkey,</HI> as well as in other places) and then by her
assistance, 'tis but putting himself in Womans Ap|parel,
which is easie to be done, considering the
Fashion of the Jewish Habit, and a Vail over his
Face, and so to follow the Female Jew as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">er Ser|vant
or Slave, by which means he will not fail of
Admission.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="55">
But as the danger is very great, so I would not
advise any person to pay so dear for the liberty of
seeing that, which perhaps will not be worth his la|bour
when he has done it: For my part, I shall de|sire
the Reader to content himself with a faithful
and exact description of what may be seen without
any Risco or hazard. And indeed a man may guess
at the inside by the Gate it self, which has nothing
at all of Magnificence, resembling rather the Gate
of some old Monastery, or some Ancient Farm
house,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. IV.</NOTE> rather than the Gate of a Palace so famous
as the <HI>Serraglio;</HI> and yet from this Gate it is, that
the Court of the Grand Signor derives its name.
The Turkish Grandees think themselves happy, in
having the Liberty only of passing through this
Gate to the <HI>Divan.</HI> For at other times admission
is forbid to all, unless it be the <HI>Hachim Bachi,</HI> or
chief Physitian, and the <HI>Katib,</HI> who may be said to
be peculiar Chaplain to the <HI>Sultan.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Description of Sancta Sophia.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<P>THe Temple of <HI>Sancta Sophia</HI> stands so near to
the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> that I cannot pass by the De|scription
of it in this place, it being the chief
<HI>Mosquee</HI> in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and the Royal Chapel
for the Grand Signor and his Retinue.</P>
<P>This famous Temple, of which the <HI>Greeks</HI> have
all along so highly boasted, and which Travellers
have so often admir'd, is seated upon the highest
and most beautiful part of all <HI>Constantinople, viz.</HI> the
uppermost part of the Promontory of <HI>Acropolis.</HI>
Some of the most Learned <HI>Greeks</HI> that live in <HI>Con|stantinople,</HI>
of which the number is not great, have
often assur'd me, that they have read in their
Histories, that the great <HI>Constantine</HI> was the first
Founder of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> having laid the Foundation
of the structure some years before his death. For
this same pious Emperour having lay'd the Foun|dation
of St. <HI>Peters</HI> in <HI>Rome,</HI> had resolv'd according
to the model of that Temple to build another at
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> which he design'd to have dedicated
<HI>to the eternal and uncreated wisdom of the Son of God;</HI>
but death having prevented him before he could
finish the work, his son <HI>Constance,</HI> who succeeded
him, went on with the Building, after the same form
and model which his father had began.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="58">
However the Platform and Ground work of the
ancient <HI>Sophia</HI> was nothing like to that which now
we see. For it was proportional to the Ground-work
of the ancient St. <HI>Peters</HI> Church, which 'tis
well known was very like to that of St <HI>Paul's</HI> in
<HI>Rome,</HI> that is to say, a very long Church, with two
Wings at the end composing the figure of a Cross,
the whole surrounded with great Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">leries suppor|ted
with Pillars for the use of the Women, who
formerly sat apart from the men at Church. But
whatever was the figure of the Ancient <HI>Sophia,</HI>
certainly it was Built in the same place where the
present <HI>Sophia</HI> stands, or else very near it: In regard
that this place being the most beautiful and proper
for an edifice of that importance, 'tis not likely that
it was built in any other part. Unless it might
be brought for an argument, because the Palace of
<HI>Constantine,</HI> and his successors, did not stand where
now the <HI>Seraglio</HI> stands, but at least a League
distant, therefore the Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ropolitan Church could not
be far from it. But to that it may be answer'd, Princes
usually have their private Chapels in their own
Pallaces, and never go to the Cathedral, but when
the necessity of the publick solemnity requires a
more extraordinary magnificence and grandeur, or
the pomp of a numerous cavalcade. And it may be
truly said, that there is no Nation under Heaven
that so much affect vanity and luster as the <HI>Greeks</HI>
do. So that nowithstandin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> the slavery and ex|tremity
of misfortune and misery, to which they
a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e red<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">c'd, nothing remains to testify the Antiquity
of that Nation, but an insupportable pride and
vain-glory. On the other side it may be said, that
the Patriarchs retinue, which consisted of all Reli|gious
persons, Priests and Church-men, did not well
agree with the Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tiers, there was always some
<PB N="83" REF="58">
quarrel or other among them; so that either for
pomp or quietness sake, there was a necessity that
the Palace and the Cathedral should stand at a good
distance asunder.</P>
<P>But whatsoever were the Antient situation of
this Church, in regard it was only cover'd with
wood, from thence it happen'd, that not only the
Church, but the City it self, has been defac'd by
several conflagrations, in the Reigns of <HI>Theodosius</HI>
the younger, and <HI>Iustinian.</HI> The last of which
Emperours took up a resolution to rebuild it from
the ground, either that he might raise an eternal
Monument to his Honour, or else to prevent any
future casualties that might happen either to the
Church or City by fire. For he knew well that
this Church had been several times burnt, once by
the malice of her enemies the <HI>Arrians,</HI> in the Reign
of <HI>Theodosius</HI> the great; another time through the
fury of the enemies of St. <HI>Iohn Chrysostome,</HI> who
set the Church on fire after they had enclos'd all
those within it, that would not consent to the
Patriarchs Banishment; which was afterwards con|sented
to by <HI>Theodosius</HI> the younger. <HI>Iustinian</HI>
therefore rebuilt it from the bottom to the top; and
changing not only the Model but the Materials,
gave it that form which now graces the whole
structure. He made not the least use of so much
as a stick of wood in the whole building, save only
to hang the Bells on, and in some few places where it
was absolutely necessary. Nevertheless the two great
Gates (which he put at the entrance into the
Church) being of wood, (though otherwise rare
Artful pieces of Workmanship, and such as for their
firmness and soliditie might have lasted many years,
yet) were not able to withstand another Conflagra|tion,
which happen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ed in the Reign of <HI>Michael Curo|palates,</HI>
<PB N="84" REF="59">
who though a person of a lew'd life, yet fail'd
not to put up new Doors, which being all of Brass,
not only serv'd to resist the fury of any future fire,
but also to eternize his renown. To which purpose,
he caus'd to be put up in great Engraven Characters
which are still to be read over the said doors, these
words, <GAP DESC="foreign">, with certain <HI>Greek</HI>
Cyphers, Garlanded round about with <HI>Labarum,</HI> or
the mark of Christianity, denoting the year
wherein he finish'd that magnificent reparation of
the doors of <HI>Sancta Sophia.</HI></P>
<P>When this Church was finish'd by <HI>Iustinian,</HI> he
lookt upon it to be so beautiful, that believing his
Temple surpass'd the Temple of <HI>Solomon</HI> in Magni|ficence,
he would when he beheld it often repeat
these words, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>I have out-done
Solomon.</HI> Certainly that good Emperour was of
opinion that the Temple of <HI>Solomon</HI> was nothing in
comparison with his. And perhaps he might well
think so, in regard that during the space of Seven|teen
years, which were spent in the Building of that
Church, all the Revenues of <HI>Egypt</HI> were set a part, to
defray the charges, which though not amounting to
above Two Millions of Gold a year, made up a sum
very considerable for that time. Besides, he erected
close by the Church a most magnificent Monastery,
and endow'd it with large Revenues, to the value of
eight Hundred Thousand Crowns <HI>per Annum,</HI> for the
maintenance of Nine Hundred Priests, who were
daily to perform Religious duties, together with a
great number of other Officer, who had continual
care of the Repairs of the Church. But how magnifi|cent
soever it were, considering what <HI>Sancta Sophia</HI>
is now, I cannot believe that ever it came near the
famous Temple of <HI>Solomon,</HI> in regard we do not find
it equal neither in largeness nor sumptuousness of
<PB N="85" REF="59">
work, to the Church of St. <HI>Peters</HI> in <HI>Rome.</HI> However
the <HI>Greeks</HI> at this day strenuously maintain other|wise,
and would make ye believe that St. <HI>Peters</HI> in
<HI>Rome</HI> is a mean thing in comparison of <HI>Sancta Sophia.</HI>
Though they who have seen both the one and the
other, and are not deprav'd or byass'd in their
judgments, may easily determine the contrary.
Nevertheless having already given a brief account
of the first Foundations, and chiefest Repairs of
this Church, I shall next give a description of the
Platform and Draught hereto annext, by which a
shrewd conjecture may be given what it is now, and
what formerly it was, as far as concerns the body
of the structure, after <HI>Iustinian</HI> had Rebuilt it.</P>
<P>The whole body of the Church of <HI>Sancta Sophia</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Note that the measures&punc; in this Book are <HI>French.</HI></NOTE>
wants but very little of a perfect square; it being
in the inside, not above Two and Forty Fathom in
length, and Eight and Thirty in breadth, situate
however like all other Churches, East and West.
The whole Platform represents a <HI>Greek</HI> Cross, al|most
as broad as long, as it were enchas'd in a wall'd
square Church-yard. A certain excellent Archi|tect,
whose name was <HI>Anthemius,</HI> was the Inventor
of the Modell; but he made no great progress in
the structure, for death prevented him, he dying
soon after he had laid the first Foundation. Which
was the reason the work was neither carry'd on nor
brought to perfection, according to the Inventer
of the first Architect. In short, he that has but
ordinary skill in Architecture, may plainly see,
that the Ground-work and superstructure of <HI>Sancta
Sophia</HI> were the inventions of different persons. For
the Ground-work had extent sufficient allow'd, but
the body of the Building is not answerable to it.
So that History tells us what a deal of trouble and
labour it cost to bring the work to perfection.
<PB N="86" REF="60">
There was always some considerable defect or
other, so that when one side was built up the other
side either fell quite down, or else considerable
riffts and gaps display'd themselves in the walls.
(So that the same ill fate may be said to have atten|ded
<HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> as befell St. <HI>Paul's</HI> in <HI>Rome,</HI> which
before it was finish'd threatned ruine to all the
neighbouring Houses.) Afterwards they found out
means and wayes to remedy all these defects:
At what time one <HI>Isidorus</HI> the younger, together
with some other Architects, laboured so successfully
in Repairing the <HI>Domo,</HI> and strengthning it by
taking it down lower, and buttressing it much more
strongly than before, that he brought it to that
perfection which it has conserv'd to this day, not|withstanding
the frequent Earth-quakes that have
since thrown down other parts of the Church, such
as that which happen'd in the Reign of <HI>Iustinian</HI>
the I. to whom we are beholding for the finishing
this Church, and for the Body of the Civil Law, or
the <HI>Iustinian Codex,</HI> this Earth-quake overthrew
all the eastern part of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> (which you find
mark'd in the Platform with the letters A. B. C. H.)
and the Semi <HI>Domo,</HI> at what time the <HI>Cupola,</HI> which
was above, with its fall brake the Altar, the holy
doors of the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI> (mark'd <HI>a, a, a.</HI>)
together with the <HI>Ambon</HI> or Preachers Pulpit,
which stood assuredly in the same place, or else
over against that of the <HI>Mufti,</HI> (which you find in
the Platform draught, pointed and mark'd with
the letter C.) <HI>Iustinian</HI> caus'd these Ruins to be
set up again, and to be strengthen'd with four But|tresses,
two large, and two lesser ones. The two
largest of these Buttresses support two small
Pillars (mark'd <HI>d</HI>) which, like those that are op|posite
to them upon the western side, near the
<PB N="87" REF="60">
doors, serve to support the <HI>semi-dome,</HI> one part of
which leans upon them, and the other upon four
great Pillars mark'd D. and upon the Arch which
they sustain.</P>
<P>These four great Pillars, with the four Arches
that joyn them together, support the great <HI>Domo</HI>
of the Church. All the world must acknowledge
it to be a bold piece of workmanship, and well
made; for it is very large, containing Eighteen
Fathoms Diameter, and Three Fathoms in depth,
letting in the light at Twenty Four Windows,
which however are very small and low. In the
spaces between the Windows are large portions of
a Circle, which as they diminish, terminate about
the middle of the <HI>Domo,</HI> where they form the
shape of a Rose, which was formerly embellish'd
with several figures in Mosaic work, as the Twenty
Four portions of a Circle that compose it also
were. But the <HI>Turks</HI> have now defac'd them, and
daub'd 'em over with white Plaistring. From this
part of the top of the Church it was, that the
usual vanity of the <HI>Greeks</HI> would make you believe,
that it was impossible for any man to look down to
the Ground, being so high, as they said, that the
sight of those that stood below could hardly reach
it. True it is, that History tells us of another <HI>Domo</HI>
that far surpass'd the present; but that, it seems
to spare the curious the trouble and the lost labour
of staring upon it at such a distance where they
could not discover it, fell down it self to the
ground, where it might be discern'd with more
ease. It brake down with its fall several things,
among the rest the Emperour and the Patriarch's
seats, which were plac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d at the two parts of the
Church mark'd with the letter <HI>c.</HI> However, as I
have said, <HI>Iustinian</HI> caus'd it to be set up again,
<PB N="88" REF="61">
and to make it more light, as they that believe the
<HI>Greeks</HI> assure us, he caus'd it to be made all of
pumice stone, with some light sort of Mortar to
cement the parts together. Could I have got up to
the top to have examin'd the truth, I would have
done it with all my heart, but as things now stand,
no Christian is permitted to soar so high, unless he
will be content to leave his <HI>Preputium</HI> below, for fear
of over charging the building, which according to
the opinion of the <HI>Turks,</HI> would certainly fall with
the weight of an Uncircumcis'd Christian. I leave it
therefore to others to satisfy the Readers Curiosity
in that particular. But this I am sure of, that all
the under part of the <HI>Domo</HI> is lin'd all over with
several Crosses trefoyld, and flower-delis'd in
Mosaic work, and that the outside is cover'd with
Lead, with a Gilded Crescent instead of a Pina|cle
in the place were the Cross formerly shew'd it
self.</P>
<P>This <HI>Domo,</HI> of which the largeness and the
place are mark'd in the following Plate with a
circle of points, covers the best part of that which
may be call'd the Body of the Church. For the
Quire was enclos'd from the eastern extremity of
this Circle, to the separation mark'd with a double
line pointed at the letters <HI>a a a,</HI> which shew the
place where stood the holy doors, and it extended
to the right and left hand as far as the two semi-circles
mark'd H. H. The entrance into the Church
was from the west extremity of the same Circle,
to the Three doors of the middle at the letter I.
Extending to the right and left hand like the Quire,
between the two letters, H. H. which shew the two
West semi-circles opposite to those of the Quire.
The space cover'd by the <HI>Domo,</HI> is just the middle
of the <HI>Greek</HI> Cross, which composes the figure of
<PB N="89" REF="61">
the Church. The head of this <HI>Greek</HI> Cross toward
the East contains the Quire and <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum;</HI>
the lower end towards the west, comprehends the
entrance and doors of the Church. The wings
consist of two Parallelogram spaces, one of which
runs to the North, and the other to the South,
mark'd in the Platform with the directions <HI>f.</HI> G.
Now in regard this Cross is as it were enchas'd in a
square that represents the walls of the Church,
there appear also four other void spaces at the
four Corners of the Square, which are mark'd
with the letter H.</P>

</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<P>Having sufficiently describ'd the <HI>Domo</HI> that
covers the Cross, which forms the middle part
of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> I now come to what is to be found
round about adjoyning. The Eastern part of the
Cross is a large semi-circle cover'd with a <HI>Demi-Dome,</HI>
made like the back of an Oven. Round
about this great semi-circle which is taken out of
the breadth of the grand <HI>Domo</HI> are to be seen Three
others lesser, which are also cover'd with their
half <HI>Cupola's,</HI> of which Two stand upon the right
and left hand, and the farthest of all in the midst.
Under this third semi-circle stood formerly the
<HI>Sanctum Sanctorum.</HI> The West part of this Cross
is the same with the East, form'd out of a large
<PB N="93" REF="63">
semi-circle, cover'd with its semi-dome, and three
others by the sides of it; with this exception,
that the middlemost, where stand the widest doors
of the Church, does not finish in a semi-circle like
that to the East, but is cut into right Angles, and
is cover'd with an Arch and not a Cupola.</P>
<P>The four smaller, semi-circles that appear upon
the sides of the two large ones, are form'd in their
extremities of one part of the four large Pillars
that support the grand <HI>Domo,</HI> mark'd in the Plat|form
draught by the letter D. and the other part
of the four lesser Pillars, two of which toward
the East support the Semi-Dome that covers the
<HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI> and the other toward the West
sustain the Arch that turns it self over the
three doors of the middle of the Church. These
Four little Pillars are mark'd in the Platform
draught by the letter <HI>d.</HI> Between these eight Pil|lars
that form the four lesser semi-circle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> above|mention'd,
stand eight Columns of Porphiry, two
under each semi-circle. They sustain six others
over them of the Womens Gallery, some of which
are more for ornament than use, as you may see
in the following Draughts, Fig. VIII. and IX. of the
inside of the Church.</P>
<P>Behind every one of these semi-circles as well
toward the East, as toward the West, is a four-square
space which might be call'd a Chapel, were
it the custome among the <HI>Greeks</HI> to have several
Chapels in the same Church; but you may call
it a <HI>Tetragon,</HI> in regard of the figure of these four
<HI>Tetragons</HI> which is four-square. Neither of these
have more than three little Windows, which hardly
suffice to let in a gloomie light. The four Cor|ners
of this <HI>Tetragon</HI> are supported with four Pil|lars
of speckl'd Marble, among which, those that
<PB N="94" REF="64">
are next the four large Pillars that sustain the
<HI>Domo</HI> are now contiguous, as being united by a
piece of Brickwork rais'd up for strengthning of
those four great Pillars, against the frequent Earth-quakes
that shake the Church. However this
Brick-work seems to be so ancient, as to make us
believe it was rather rais'd by the <HI>Greeks</HI> than by
the <HI>Turks.</HI> It is mark'd in the Platform draughts
by points at the letter K.</P>
<P>Between these four <HI>Tetragons</HI> or four-square
spaces, are two other spaces somewhat oblong,
one to the North and the other to the South. They
are also like the former sustain'd by four Pillars of
speckl'd marble. But there is some difference in
the situation of these two Columns: For whereas
the other Pillars stand at the four Corners, these
stand in the middle of the space, and making a par|ticular
and very narrow Roof, which they support,
divide as it were the space into two parts. These
four Columns, and the oblong space wherein they
are rais'd from the two Wings of the <HI>Greek</HI> Cross,
upon the frame whereof the whole Fabric is rear'd;
and the four <HI>Tetragons</HI> are as it were the four spa|ces,
that would appear round about a Cross plac'd
upon a Table in a square.</P>
<P>The Twenty Four Columns that support the
Roofs of these six places which I have describ'd
are all of the same thickness, the same bigness and
of the same Marble. But the four other Pillars,
that appear upon each side of the Church, between
the two large Pillars of the grand <HI>Domo,</HI> are much
higher and bigger, though they are all of the same
stone, and all of one piece. These four Pillars
support six others that belong to the Womens
lower Gallery, which support the second, as
well upon the right as the left Wing of the
<PB N="95" REF="64">
Church, as you may see in the Draughts of the in|side
of the Church. And thus all the Pillars that
rise from the Foundation of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> are no
more than Forty, that is to say, twenty of a side.
These Forty lower Columns support Sixty others
in the Womens Galleries above, so that all the
Pillars in <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> as well above as below, ex|ceed
not the number of a Hundred in the body of
the Church, with four of a middle size, and three
small ones, which are over the doors, and make in
all a Hundred and Seven Pillars. All these Pillars
are well turn'd, but their Chapters do not answer
at all to the beauty of their turning. For it is a
hard thing to distinguish of what Order they are,
unless you will call it by the name of the <HI>Grecian-Gothick.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum</HI> was formerly confin'd
within the space which is mark'd with the letters
<HI>a a a.</HI> and B. now the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who never say above
one Mass in a day in one Church, never had in
<HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> nor in any other of their Chur|ches,
above one Altar which stands on that side
which you will find mark'd in the Platform draught
with the letter A. This custom was also observ'd
a long time in the <HI>Latine</HI> Church, as well as in the
<HI>Greek.</HI> But when the number of <HI>Christians</HI> infinitely
increas'd, the necessity of having more Priests aug|mented
the number also of Altars, and Sacrifices,
to satifie the devotion of a great number of people,
that were not able to crowd together to hear
one single service in one place. This Altar is by
the <HI>Greeks</HI> to this day call'd <GAP DESC="foreign">, enclos'd
within a space which they call <GAP DESC="foreign">, and the <HI>Latins
Sanctum Sanctorum.</HI> This place is always the most
Eastern part of the Church, and terminated on the
one side in a semi-circle cover'd with a half <HI>Domo;</HI>
<PB N="96" REF="65">
on the other side in an enclosure, which the <HI>Greeks</HI>
call'd <GAP DESC="foreign">, or the <HI>stand of Images.</HI> This en|closure
was made of wood, richly carv'd and adorn'd
with sundry figures, having three doors, the mid|dlemost
being the biggest, and two others that
were less of each side. The middlemost was only
for the Priest to go in and out during the Sacrifice.
The second on the right hand admitted only the
Deacon; and the other on the left was free for the
other Officers. Between the middlemost door
and the two others stood the Images of our Lady,
St. <HI>Iohn</HI> the <HI>Baptist,</HI> and over the Three doors
were the figures of the Twelve Apostles. The
Images that stood upon this <HI>Eikonostation,</HI> were al|ways
in high veneration among the <HI>Greeks</HI> above
any other; they lighted up a great number of Ta|pers
before them, and frequently ador'd them with
their <HI>Metaniai</HI> or Genuflections to the Earth.</P>
<P>This is a brief account of the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI>
before the <HI>Turks</HI> turn'd the <HI>Sancta Sophia</HI> into a
<HI>Mosquee.</HI> But now the case is quite another thing.
The Altar was broken down by <HI>Mahomet,</HI> at what
time (with the City) he took the Church from the
Christians, and dedicated it to his false <HI>Mahomet.</HI>
Now in regard the <HI>Turks</HI> in their Mosquees offer to
God only the Sacrifice of thanksgivings, there is
nothing within their Churches which is particularly
sanctify'd, but the <HI>Mirabe</HI> or <HI>Maharab,</HI> which is a
sort of large <HI>Niche</HI> in the wall, where they put
their <HI>Alkoran.</HI> That of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> is all of
Marble, embellish'd with great store of <HI>Moresco</HI>
work and <HI>Gilding.</HI> It is mark'd in the Platform
draught with the letter B. Neither is it plac'd
directly in the middle of the uppermost part of
the <HI>Mosquee,</HI> for that being bilt by the Christians,
the situation was not convenient for the <HI>Turks,</HI> who
<PB N="97" REF="65">
when they pray are oblig'd to turn always toward
<HI>Koble,</HI> or that part where the City of <HI>Mecca</HI> stands.
So that seeing they could not alter the situation of
the Church to the South-East, which is the only
point of the Compass the <HI>Turks</HI> adore, they have only
mended the situation of their <HI>Maharah,</HI> to turn it
toward their beloved point, for the better observa|tion
of the <HI>Musselmen.</HI> This <HI>Maharah</HI> is rivited into
a little counterwall, that reaches no farther than
the first Windows, and at the hight of the arch re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">urns
again to receive into its concavity, the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ooks which the <HI>Imans</HI> make use of when they read
Prayers. This counter-wall is mark'd in the
Platform draught with two semi-circular lines at
the East end of the Church, where now this <HI>Maharah</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tands, and where was formerly the <HI>Synthronos</HI> of
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">he Patriarch of <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P>Over against the place mark'd with the direction
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. as also the place opposite to it, was formerly a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">assage through which the Priests went from the
Vestry to the Altar. But those two passages are
now stopp'd up, and that which is mark'd with
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">he said <HI>Direction,</HI> is now made a Closet, Wain|scoted
Guilded, and spread with rich Carpets,
with a large Window all the length of the Closet,
glaz'd and lattis'd, where the Grand Signor hears
Prayers, and pays his Devotions to his false Pro|phet.
He enters into it through a door which is
near the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> and which never opens but only
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o himself, being mark'd with the direction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">. at
which being enter'd, he assends through a little
lattic'd Gallery into his Closet, where he has a full
view of all that are in the Mosquee, without being
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">een by any. This Closet is mark'd in the Platform
Draught, by the points next to the direction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">.
There are also other things mark'd in the Platform
<PB N="98" REF="66">
Drughts with points, as the singing mens Terra|ces
at the direction D. the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">fti's</HI> Mamber at C.
and the Preachers Pulpit at G.</P>
<P>Having sufficiently describ'd the Cross and inner
part of the Platform of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> I shall now
describe the Compass of the Walls, which area
square building, enveloping the Cross that gives
form to the Church. The Eastern part toward
the <HI>Serraglio</HI> had four doors formerly belonging to
it, of which two are now stopp'd up, the third is for
the Grand Signors privacy alone, and the fourth is
public to all, and mark'd with the letter Q.
Through this door you descend twelve steps to
enter into <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> in regard the <HI>Piazza</HI> of the
<HI>Serraglio</HI> is much higher than the Foundation of the
Church. Between these two last doors contiguous
to the Walls stand the four Buttresses which <HI>Iusti|nian</HI>
caus'd to be erected, to support the oriental
<HI>Demi-dome,</HI> which being thrown down by an Earth-quake,
and having broke down the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum</HI>
with the fall, he caus'd it to be replac'd where it
stands at the two extremities of this oriental part.
At the letter M. Stand two Towers, of which that on
the South-side is the biggest and lowest of all the four
that stand at the four Corners of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> as
being built in hast, after that <HI>Mahomet</HI> II. had
chang'd the Church into a <HI>Mosquee;</HI> and was the
first piece of Building which the <HI>Turks</HI> ever erected
in <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P>The South and North part of <HI>Sancta Sophia</HI>
differ very little, as having both the one and the
other, Five pair of stairs, Twelve Windows, and
Two doors apiece. Of the Five pair of staires
there are Two very large that ascend to the top of
the Church, and which were not only Built to ac|commodate
the Women in their going up to the
<PB N="99" REF="66">
Galleries, but also serv'd to support the <HI>Doma</HI> of the
Church. They are mark'd in the Platform Draught
with the letter E. The Three other pair of stairs
go no higher then into the Womens lower Gallery.
And of these, two pair are plac'd at the two Cor|ners
that make the square of the Church, opening
into the Church-yard, for the sake of the Women,
who by that means went and came without
being seen of the Men. But the door to the middle
most pair is within the Church, as serving only for
the use of the Priests and Deacons, whose business
it was to perfume the Womens Galleries, during
Divine service. The doors belonging ot the stairs
within the Church, open only to the Galleries
above. The Twelve Windows in each of the fronts
North and South are very small, contain'd under
four large Arches. The four doors which for|merly
open'd to the North and South are now
stopp'd up, all but one to the South mark'd with
the letter Q.</P>
<P>All the West part of <HI>Sancta Sophia</HI> is taken up
with two <HI>Vestibulums</HI> or <HI>Portico's,</HI> and a little
Court that lyes before them. The biggest of these
two Portico's which joyn to the Church is double;
that is to say, one above, and another below. The
lowermost is the true Portico to the Church, for
that above is only a Gallery belonging to the <HI>Gunai|keion.</HI>
The inferiour Portico opens with Sixteen
doors, Nine to the East, Five to the West, One
to the North and another to the South. All these
doors are of Marble, and the folders are of Copper
or Brass, adorn'd with several flat Crosses, Trefoild
or Flowerdeliz'd; from all which the <HI>Turks</HI> have
taken the thwart pieces, not believing that Christ,
whom they acknowledge to be a great Prophet,
was ever Cr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">cify'd himself in person, but only
<PB N="100" REF="67">
that some Fantom or Apparition seemingly suffer'd
in his stead. And therefore they cannot indure to
behold at the very entrance into the <HI>Mosquee,</HI> such
marks of Jewish cruelty, and Christian stupidity,
in reference to the Article of our Saviours passion.
The space between the doors is lin'd all with fair
Marble of various colours, and border'd with A|lablaster
Garlands of several sorts. Over all this
Marble Embroidery, that reaches to the top of the
Gates, are several Figures and Crosses in <HI>Mosaic</HI>
work, which the <HI>Turks</HI> have not yet so much de|fac'd,
but that above the Three doresin the middle
you may discern the Picture of our Saviour
giving his blessing to an Emperour prostrated at his
feet, with a <HI>Panhagia,</HI> or our Lady on his Right
hand, and the <HI>Prodromos</HI> or <HI>Iohn</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> upon
his left. The upper part of the space between
these West doors of the Portico, is enlighten'd with
three small Windows, contain'd under an Arch;
the lower part being full of small <HI>Terraces,</HI> which
I have not mark'd, in regard they are only of
wood. At the two extremities of this Portico,
are two large entrances or Portalls, where are to
be seen several Pictures in <HI>Mosaic</HI> work, and other
pieces of Carving upon the Brazen Folders, and
these words already recited, <GAP DESC="foreign">,
with several Cyphers denoting the year when the
doors were set up. Then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nder each of these large
Portalls, are two lesser doors, that lead to the
Womens Gallery up an easy pair of stairs, mark'd
with the letter E.</P>
<P>Going out of this Portico, at the West side, you
enter into another Portico, neither so long nor so
large as the former. It was by the <HI>Greeks</HI> call'd
<HI>Nartex,</HI> mark'd in the Platform draught with the
letter N. Now in regard this <HI>Nartex</HI> serv'd to
<PB N="101" REF="67">
no other use then to receive the Penitents and <HI>Ca|techumeni</HI>
or Proselytes, who were not admitted into
the Church, till satisfaction given, or before Bap|tisme,
we do not find the least appearance, that
ever it had any great cost bestowed upon it, being
very plain, with a roof like the bone of a Fish,
and pav'd only with great pieces of Marble without
any order or design. Which is the reason that
some believe, that this first Portico was not built
at the same time with the rest of the Church, be|cause
it hinders the sight of the Front. But in
regard we do not find by any probable conjecture,
that there was ever any other Front or Entrance
into the Church, then what it still to be seen, and
for that it is a thing unlikely that they would have
rais'd a Tower not above Twenty paces from the
main structure, and half a dozen open Arches at
the same distance, without closing up the whole
with a wall, and some slight covering instead of a
Portico, we may well believe, this Portico to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e
as ancient as the rest of the Church, as being built
after the same manner and form with the rest of
the particular parts.</P>
<P>At the two extremities of this <HI>Portico</HI> stand two
little doors mark'd in the Platform Draught with
the letter M. These are the doors of the Towers
upon the West part of the Church, through which
the <HI>Muezins</HI> ascend when they go to call the peo|ple
to Church; and which had the <HI>Turks</HI> any
Bells would serve for Steeples. Round about the
Tower upon the South side are several Fountaines
under a Gallery, supported by Eight Pillars mar|ked
with the letter R. The west part of this <HI>Nar|tex</HI>
receives in the Light at thirteen Windows,
and opens with Three doors, of which Tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> are
very large for the use of the people, the other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ery
<PB N="102" REF="68">
small, not far from the Tower mark'd with the
letter O. This Tower was formerly the Steeple
belonging to the Church; now a useless vacuity,
the <HI>Turks</HI> having converted the Bells into the
lowder, and less pleasing Music of the Cannon.
The little door is only for the <HI>Muezins</HI> and other
Officers of the Mosquee, who have their Cham|bers
round a small Court, mark'd in the Platform
Draught with the Directions S. and T. There is
also in this Court belonging altogether to the old
Steeple, a place where you descend Thirty steps
to fetch water out of a large Cistern, which runs
under all the body of the Church, and discharges
it self out of several Cocks mark'd in the Platform
Draught with the letter P. Near to thse steps, and
toward the middle of the Court, stands a large
Vessel in which the Officers wash their Linnen and
other Habits. I have also mark'd it with the
letter V. not that it is a thing so much worth notice,
but that the Reader may observe the exactness and
fidelity of the Draught, if ever it be his chance to
Travell to <HI>Constantinople.</HI> He will also find at the
direction &cross;. a small octogon Chappel, which
serves now to no other use then to lay the provi|sion
of Hay and Oates for the <HI>Sultans</HI> adjoyning
stables. It was formerly the Vestry belonging to
the Church, of which there is still some likelihood
remaining, there being a door out of this place
into the Church, which I have fill'd up with small
Tittles, to shew that it is now quite stopp'd up.
All this that I have said may be seen in the platform
Draught, and therefore I shall cease to tire the
Reader with any farther topographical descripti|on.
As for the measure I have reduc'd it to the
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">adom, call'd<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The <HI>toi|se de charpen|tier</HI> is five Foot and a half The <HI>petit pi|ed</HI> is some inchesless than the Carpen|ters foot.</NOTE> <HI>Toise de petit pied,</HI> by which the
Reader may view and examine every thing with|out
<PB N="103" REF="68">
any fear of being deceiv'd, or making
false conjectures, as being drawn with all the ex|actness
imaginable.</P>
<P>Having thus describ'd the Platform, I come now
to the elevation of the Church. True it is, that
all persons who till now have heard talk of the
Church of <HI>Sancta. Sophia,</HI> have been easily led
to believe, that the out side and inside of it was a
Master-piece of Architecture, and that the orna|ments
both without and within do not give place
to any of the stately and magnificent structures
in <HI>Europe;</HI> and all this not only upon the credit of
the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who in all Ages however have been
look'd upon as vain boasters, but also perswaded
thereto by several Travellers, who have made de|scriptions
perhaps more pleasing to the ear, than
approaching to truth. But for my part not belie|ving
the Hyperboles of Poetical fancies, and not
finding the Historians of chiefest credit, who spake
most highly in praise of this Astonishing pile, have
gone any farther than big words, which only fill
the mind with false Idea's without having vouch|saf'd
us the least Line of a Description by way of
Draught, or the least touch of Pencil or Graver.
I have therefore presum'd to do more and say less,
for the satisfaction of the Reader, who is left to
his own judgment, knowing that of the Poet to be
true,

<HEAD>A Description of the Building and Eleva|tion
of Sancta Sophia.</HEAD>
<P>WHich way soever you take a prospect of
<HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> of which the foregoing
Draught by a Prospect to the North and West, it
appears always square, for that the body of the
<PB N="107" REF="70">
Church would be perfectly so, were it but only
four Fadom more in breadth. At the four cor|ners
of the square, which is under the <HI>Domo,</HI> and
which is rais'd upon the four large inside Pillars,
stand four large massie Buttresses, admitting the
light in at three Windows. In every one of which
is an easy pair of stairs leading up to the top of the
Church, mark'd in this plate with the letter B.
Between which Butteresses run the Womens Gal|leries,
whither they also lead. Of which the
upper are mark'd C. shorter and narower, as ter|minating
between the two large Buttresses. The
other or the lowermost is mark'd D, broader and
longer, as having the same dimensions with the
wings of the Church. To the upper Gallery be|long
seven little Windows without, answering to
as many Arches which were formerly open in the
inside of the Church, now by the <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rks</HI> quite stop|p'd
up, as having no need of so many out-lets for
their Women, since they are not permitted to
come to Church. Above the roof of the upper
<HI>Gynaikeion,</HI> runs a single Wall cover'd with an Arch,
and receiving the light in at Twelve ill-shap'd Win|dows;
Seven of which are very small, and in a right
line to the very roof of the upper Gallery, and
Five somewhat bigger in the midst of the Seven
below. All this is cover'd with a large <HI>Domo,</HI> on
the top of which mark'd A, stands a pinacle of
Brass guilded, with a Crescent of the same at the
top. Which manner of finishing is observ'd in all the
publick Buildings among the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>Under this <HI>Domo,</HI> on the west part of the Church
is a <HI>Semi-Dome</HI> with Five Windows, of which one
is shut up. It appears at the side of two small
Cupola's, which have between them one large semi|circular
window parted into six Lights, with a
<PB N="108" REF="71">
thwart piece of stone-work, which rests upon two
small Columns that support two others. Those
two little Cupola's were only plac'd in that part
for ornament, for they have no overture into the
inside of the Church, nor into themselves, as not
being hollow. Between these little <HI>Cupola's</HI>
and the large Buttresses there are two other <HI>Semi|Domes,</HI>
one of each side, having formerly six
Windows a piece. But the continual Earth-quakes
were the occasion that some of them were stopp'd
up. These two Demi-Domes upon the West side,
with the two that answer them upon the East side,
cover the four Semi-circles of the Quire, and the
entrance into the <HI>Sophia</HI> mark'd in Fig. V. with the
letter H.</P>
<P>A little below these three Semi-Domes runs a
great Gallery with nine great Windows, every one
of which is parted with a thwart piece of stone|work,
and a part of two little square Pillars, all of
Marble, of which the <HI>Portico</HI> under it has as many.
It is mark'd with the letter E. and is supported
with six Buttresses, in the midst of which runs up a
foursquare Tower mark'd H. it is not above Fifty
Fadom high, and was therefore the Steeple former|ly
belonging to the Church; but could not contain
very many nor very great Bells, in regard it was
no bigger. Under the Buttresses behind the Steeple,
is a little <HI>Portico</HI> or <HI>Nartex</HI> mark'd G. and near to
it at the direction I, is a large door that leads to
the Cocks of the Cistern under the Church. The
Trees adjoyning shade a little Court belonging to
the Officers of the Mosquee, whose lesser Chambers
you may see at the letter O.</P>
<P>At the four corners of all the Building stand
four Towers, all delicate pieces of Workmanship,
except that which stands behind the Mosquee, of
<PB N="109" REF="71">
which you see no part in this Draught but only the
Spire near to the letter A. They are mark'd with
the letter M. having above but one Gallery, which is
as high as the Windows of the great <HI>Domo,</HI> but they
bear their Pinacles above that of the <HI>Domo.</HI> Round
about the two Minarets or Towers, upon the West
side of the Church, are the three principal entran|ces
into them, mark'd in the Platform Fig. V. with
the letter E. but in this last plate with the
letter K. in regard that in this place there is but
one to be seen. It is cover'd with a little <HI>Domo,</HI>
at the side whereof there is a little stone cut into
steps, for those that ride to the Mosquee, to alight,
or to get up on Horseback. To the East of this
Tower is to be seen one of the Entrances into the
large <HI>Portico,</HI> mark'd E. This is the North entrance,
where you descend by steps into the Church, by
reason the pavement of the street in that place is
higher then the Pavement of the Church. Within
this entrance upon the left hand, as also at the other
end of the <HI>Portico,</HI> appear two little doors opening
upon an easie pair of stairs that lead to the upper
Galleries. From this entrance into the grand <HI>Porti|co,</HI>
there runns a little Wall, that encloses the three
North half Buttresses, and the space between them
makes a little long Court, planted with some few
young Trees. This wall ends at a little <HI>Octogon</HI>
Chapel, which was formerly the Vestry, mark'd
with the direction &cross; in Fig. V. and in this Draught
with the letters P. Q. Between this little Chapel
and the Tower behind it, is one of the entrances
into one of the upper Galleries mark'd in Fig. V.
with the letter E. but not to be seen in this latter
plate, because this Chapel hides it in such a
manner, that it is not to be discover'd, but as you
enter, or stand just right against it: Now in
<PB N="110" REF="72">
regard it was at this private and little frequented
door that I always went into the Church to take
my Draughts and observations of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI>
I will recreate this tiresome description with the
story of an accident that befell me, at what time I
was at the height of all my business.</P>
<P>The eager longing which we have to see, and en|joy
what we desire, exposes us to many hazards. For
the gaining of that, we sacrifice oftentimes what is
most dear to us in the world. I met at <HI>Constantinople</HI>
with two persons who had orders from His most
Christian Majesty to Travel the East, and to
bring him back upon their return the most exact
Draughts and faithful relations of whatever they
could meet with that was most worthy observation.
To this purpose, as I was one day studiously rea|ding
their instructious, I found that among other
things, they were expresly commanded, if it might
possibly be accomplish'd, to take the Draught of
the inside and outside of <HI>Sancta Sophia.</HI> Now un|derstanding
that neither of these two Travellers
had dar'd to expose themselves to the danger, it
came into my mind, perceiving they had left <HI>Con|stantinople</HI>
without adventring to pursue the Kings
commands, that I might perhaps have better success,
if for the satisfaction of my Prince I should take
upon me to run a little more hazard then they were
willing to undergo, that were under the Kings
Sallery, and honoured with his commands.</P>
<P>Foreseeing therefore how dangerous a thing it
was to take the Draughts and measures of <HI>Sancta
Sophia,</HI> and that neither my long habit,
my long beard, nor the Title and quality of
Physician, which I took upon me, would stand me
in any stead, I had recourse to intreague and policy.
For we do meet with some persons, who by vertue of
some engagements or other, do at length attain the
<PB N="111" REF="72">
ends which they propose to themselves. To this
purpose I address'd my self to a certain <HI>Greek,</HI> who
had all the good qualities of a person who sought
nothing more then to do kindnesses when opportuni|ty
offer'd. He was a Goldsmith by Trade, which
he follow'd less then the zealous affection which
appear'd in him to excess, to do courtesies for his
friends. He liv'd near the Church, which made
me believe he might be acquainted with some of
the Officers belonging to it. To him therefore
having particularly imparted my design, he told
me, he would discourse the business to one of his
Neighbours, and put me in farther hopes, that he
did not doubt but that when he went to cary home
certain toys which he was making for one of his
Wives, he should accomplish my business over
two or three Flingeans or cups of Coffee, especially
having had success, in things of much more dan|ger.
I left with him a <HI>Venetian Sequin</HI> to drink,
worth seven<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">or two French Crowns and a half.</NOTE> <HI>Livers,</HI> ten <HI>Sous French,</HI> and promis'd
him more if he could but get me the liberty to
take the Draughts and Measures of <HI>Sancta Sophia.</HI></P>
<P>The next morning the <HI>Greek</HI> came to my Lodg|ing
at <HI>Galata,</HI> and carry'd me to <HI>Constantinople</HI> to
a person near his house, with whom I had cer|tainly
made a better composition, had he drank as
much Wine as he made use of Oyl. He was the
chief <HI>Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">tar Agasi,</HI> or <HI>Caudilafti,</HI> belonging to the
Mosquee, that is to say, the chief of those who are
imploy'd to look after the Lamps. Neither is
the <HI>Muctariat</HI> of this Mosquee a small Office. For
as it is his business sometimes to keep above two
Thousand Lamps lighted at a time, especially all
the Ramazan nights, it behoves him to have his
hands as clean as a Mahometan, from all other de|filement
but those of durty Gold; to which pur|pose
he washes them every moment, not being
<PB N="112" REF="73">
able to avoid the greasie kindnesses which the Oyl
will sometimes drop upon his fingers. This good
man, whom it was impossible to gain by never so
many Lamps full of Wine, in regard he was an
old curmudgeon that never drank any, told me at
my first approaches, that his Goldsmith had ex|treamly
surpriz'd him, in acquainting him that I had
a desire to take the Draughts and measures of the
inside of <HI>Sancta Sophia;</HI> that perhaps I was igno|rant,
that the entrance into that holy place was
open to none but <HI>Mussullmen,</HI> and that there
could not be a greater crime then to admit a <HI>Giaur</HI>
or infidell to take the Draughts and measures of
that place as I design'd. True it was indeed, that
having the care of the Lamps and the Galleries, he
could giye me entrance above and below, without
any danger, provided it were not in prayer time,
but to stay three whole days as I desir'd, he could
by no means permit me, without the hazard of his
own life, as well as of mine, should I be discern'd
by any one during prayer time, or be surprized by
any of the other Officers who had keys as well as
himself.</P>
<P>I understood by his canting what he drove at,
and that there was a necessity of some other then
the usual key to open the Gallery doors. To this end
I made use of a neat Watch that I had bought by
chance for three <HI>Venetian Sequins,</HI> though it were
worth above <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ix, and which I carry'd with me out
of a design to present him if he accomplish'd my
purpose. This Watch I drew out, lookt what was
a Clock, and then wound it up before his face. The
baite took, the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">chtar</HI> fail'd not to ask me to let
him see it, and finding it pleas'd his fancy, deman|ded
of me if I would fell it. I answer'd the Watch
Watch worth ten <HI>Sequins,</HI> but since it pleas'd him,
<PB N="113" REF="73">
I would pesent it to him <HI>jaba</HI> or gratis, if by his
permission I might see the inside of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI>
and stay there three or four days at several times,
that I would go in before <HI>Salem-namasi</HI> or before
day break Prayer, and that I would not stir out
till after <HI>Accham-namasi</HI> or Evening Prayer:
which since he had the Keyes himself, might be
done without any hazard to himself or me, so he
let no body in besides my self.</P>
<P>The covetous fox, having his eyes dazl'd with
the sight of my Watch, cry'd out, <HI>br&eacute; guidi kiafer
choc ister sen bir sahat ichun. Ah Devil of an Infidell
you ask too much for your Watch.</HI> However he added,
that seeing the earnest desire I had, he willingly
granted for his part what I demanded; but that
not being the only person that kept the Keyes of
the Galleries, therefore to make sure work, it be|hov'd
me to speak to two Officers of the Mosquee,
who as well as himself had all the Keyes of the same
places; however he did not question but that for
some small matter he should prevail with them to
my satisfaction, and that he would give notice to
the Goldsmith of his success.</P>
<P>The <HI>Greek</HI> either out of affection or interest
seem'd to be most passionately concern'd in my
behalf, not giving himself any rest for solliciting
the <HI>Candilafti</HI> or Lamp-lighter to perform his
promise, so that in few days he came to me
like one overjoy'd, and told me that my business
was effected, that I had nothing to do but to go
the next Morning, being <HI>Monday,</HI> and wait at the
private door of the <HI>Mosquee,</HI> which would not fail
to fly open to me, by vertue of the charmes of my
Watch and four <HI>Sequins</HI> more, which I was to give
to the two other Officers mention'd by the <HI>Muctar:</HI>
who being satisfy'd, I might have liberty to draw,
<PB N="114" REF="74">
take measures, and do what else I pleas'd, but
dig up the Foundations of the Mosquee.</P>
<P>I that had never pay'd less than five and twenty
<HI>per cent</HI> for my Bills of Exchange, that I might not
fail of my time, and thought my Watch a suffi|cient
price for the satisfaction of my curiosity, was
very loath to part with my four <HI>Sequins,</HI> to the
value of Ten Crowns; considering withal, that it
was not a Mile to the bottom of my Purse. Never|theless
after many contests in vain, seeing those <HI>A|dorers</HI>
of Silver would not bate me a doit, alleadg|ing
still the great danger and hazard which they ran
for my sake, I was perswaded to cross the Cudgells,
that I might see some thing in <HI>Constantinople,</HI>
which was a raritie, and which I was assur'd that
no person but my self was ever before Master of:
Thereupon I went to the place appointed, and
foreseeing that there would be some want of a
little refreshment in regard I was not going to keep
the <HI>Turkish</HI> Ramazan or Lent, but only to draw the
Draught of the Church, I carry'd with me a <HI>Bologna
Sawsage,</HI> a Bottle of Wine, and a Loaf. Which
had been sufficient to have cost me my dear life, had
they found me eating Bacon and drinking Wine, the
two abominations chiefly forbidden by their Law,
and polluting with them the holyest of all their
Mosquees. Thus I spent the first day well enough
without any interruption in the Gallery. But the
next day was not so calm. For whilst the <HI>Turk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>
were at their Devotions, I fell to my Sawsage and
Wine, and by that time they had done Praying, I
had done eating; and was fallen very serious again
to my business. When lo, athwart the Pillars at
the other end of the Church in the Galleries, I per|ceiv'd
a tall long fellow stalking toward that part
where I was, who I found had let himself in at
<PB N="115" REF="74">
another door than that at which my Introductor
had let me in.</P>
<P>I was firmly of belief, seeing a white Turbant,
and a person whom I knew not, that my business
was done, should it prove to be any other, than
one of those whom the Muctar had made of the
conspiracy. I was in a strange <HI>Quandary;</HI> some|times
I thought, because I was at my repast while
the <HI>Turks</HI> were at Prayers, that some person had
spy'd me from below, as having perhaps had the
ill luck while the people in the Mosquee were pro|s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rated
with their heads to the earth, and kissing
the Ground and crying out <HI>Alla hecher,</HI> to have too
much exalted mine out of my zeal to drink their
healths, and to play upon my soft Instrument
to their lowd Musick. I was in a peck of trou|bles,
and knew not what to do in the condition
wherein I was: besides that I knew not where to
bestow my papers, pencills and Bottle, for which I
could find no excuse in the world. It was a crime
that neither stake nor fire could hardly have expi|ated,
to find a <HI>Giaur</HI> making figures, eating Pork,
and drinking Wine, in the <HI>Turks Holy</HI> of <HI>Holyes.</HI>
I must confess I was never in such a Pannic dread in
all my life, and that I never saw the shape and
likeness of death so exactly drawn before my eyes
in all my days.</P>
<P>However though I firmly believ'd my self to be a
person no longer of this world, yet that I might
not be surpriz'd with my Bottle and Sawsage, I
hid them together with my papers under a Carpet
in a dark corner, with all the speed I could, and
so drawing forth my Rosary, and a certain book
which I had about me, written by <HI>Peter Gilius,</HI> I
return'd to my feat, and put my self into a posture
of one that had but newly said his Prayers.
<PB N="116" REF="75">
Every step the <HI>Turk</HI> made toward the upper <HI>Por|tico,</HI>
from whence I had been drawing the bottom
of the Church, my deadly fears augmented. But
in regard he came but slowly on, I had time to re|collect
my Spirits, to put on a good face, and con|firm
my self in those resolutions I had always
taken, which were rather to lose my Life a thou|sand
times, than my <HI>Praeputium</HI> once.</P>
<P>Thus feigning my self to be at my Prayers, I
held my Book, which I had no great maw to look
in at that time, in my left hand, and my Rosary in
my right hand, with the Beads whereof I was fum|bling,
when the <HI>Turk</HI> approach'd me; and instead
of a <HI>Salamalek,</HI> or <HI>How d'ye do,</HI> cry'd, <HI>Br&egrave; guidi
giaur ne uhlersen bonda; Villain of an Infidel! what
ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">' st thou here?</HI> I answer'd him, after I had look'd
very seriously in my Book, and turn'd over two or
three of my Beads according to the Musselmen's
manner: <HI>Sir, I am at my Prayers, stay a little while I
beseech ye.</HI>&mdash;After which, having made a Genu|flexion,
together with the sign of the Cross, I rose
up to speak to him. <HI>Salamalekum Aga,</HI> said I, or
<HI>Good day t'ye, Sir;</HI> then going on, <HI>You need not won|der,
Sir,</HI> quoth I, <HI>to find a Christian alone in the Galle|ries
of</HI> Sancta Sophia; adding, <HI>he knew it was a Church
formerly built by the Christians, who had still a great
Veneration for it, and being one of those, that I had
obtain'd permission to be let in, to the end I might
spend some few hours in Devotion and Prayer, and that
I expected him who had let me in, to come suddenly and
let me out again.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Turk,</HI> who was one of those who had shar'd
my four <HI>Sequins,</HI> having heard me, presently se|ren'd
his tempestuous Countenance, not being able

<HEAD>A Description of the South Prospect
of Sancta Sophia.</HEAD>
<P>HAving already describ'd the North Prospect
of St. <HI>Sophia,</HI> it will not be much material
to add the South Prospect, the Fronts of both being
so very like. The great <HI>Domo,</HI> weather-beaten
with its Pinacle, and Pinacle-head mark'd A, is the
same on both sides, having four and twenty Win|dows
plac'd upon a Square, supported with three
large Buttresses mark'd B, surrounded with Gal|leries
C and D, accompany'd with Semi-domes,
and adorn'd with a <HI>Vestibulum</HI> and <HI>Portico's,</HI> as at
E. G. grac'd with four Towers mark'd M, and
beautifi'd with Gardens like the other Mosquees.
I shall therefore only add for the satisfaction of
the Reader, the most remarkable differences be|tween
the two Fronts, North and South.</P>
<P>To begin therefore at the Letter P. This
Letter marks out several Fountains under a small
Gallery: For the <HI>Turks</HI> never enter the Mosquee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="119" REF="78">
say their Prayers, before they have wash'd every
part of the Body, which they think has commit|ted
any offence; believing that not only the least
drop of Urine, or any other Excrement, may defile
them, but also the hearing of reproachful and scan|dalous
words, and what ever the voluptuous Sences
entertain of wanton pleasure; for which reason they
always wash the principal inlets of sensual Delight.
And therefore they never build any Mosquee with|out
the provision of several Fountains, or some
small Stream, for which they make an artificial
Chanel to bring it up to the Mosquee, for the con|veniency
of the Musselmen travelling upon the
Road. And indeed there are always near their
Mosquees two sorts of Fountains, the one to wash
in, the other to drink. To the first belong certain
Cocks, which are free for every one to turn, either
to wash withall, or drink; for the Water is always
very clear, and very well tasted. To the second
belong certain neat Pots of Copper tinn'd, where
attends a person employ'd for that purpose to di|stribute
to every one what he has occasion for, to
quench his thirst. Did the <HI>Turks</HI> but love the juice
of the Grape as well as the <HI>Germans,</HI> and were not
Wine forbidden by their Law, it would have been
a much greater convenience, and an act of higher
Charity to have erected so many Taverns near the
Tombs of the Dead, where the Living might have
drank the Founders Health in good Wine of free|cost;
than so many pitiful Water-Almshouses or
<HI>Sebilkanas,</HI> of which there are many adjoyning to
the Tombs of great Personages and <HI>Grand Signors,</HI>
where the people fuddle nothing but fair Water
in memory of their Benefactors; of which number
is this adjoyning to <HI>Sancta Sophia</HI> near the Letter Q,
upon the South side. This <HI>Sebilkana,</HI> or Water|fudling
<PB N="120" REF="79">
School, is one of the most ancient in <HI>Con|stantinople,</HI>
being erected by <HI>Sultan Mahomet,</HI> surnam'd

the principal part of what I am going to describe;</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="80">
There was formerly but one Altar in this Church,
where now there is none at all. It was plac'd at
the Letter A, and a little below there was a sepa|ration
of Wood gilded and adorn'd with Pictures,
and opening with three Doors which the <HI>Greeks</HI> call
<HI>Hagiai Tirai,</HI> or <HI>The holy Doors,</HI> for that they be|long'd
to the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum.</HI> The Quire for
the Singers enclos'd all that space contain'd be|tween
the two small Pillars at the lower end of the
Church (upon which that separation call'd the
<HI>Eikonostasion</HI> joyn'd) and the two large Oriental
Pillars that sustain'd the <HI>Domo,</HI> against which the
two Seats of the Emperour and Patriarch were
fix'd, the one on the North, and the other on the
South side. Now for the sake of these two Seats,
and the rest with which this place was environ'd,
therefore was it call'd <HI>Ambon,</HI> or <HI>The place of Seats.</HI>
It was just under the Oriental Semidome, having
five Windows, but low, and giving little light.
All the Seats of this <HI>Ambon</HI> were taken away, when
<HI>Mahomet</HI> the Second turn'd the Church into a Mos|quee.
But the <HI>Mirabe</HI> or <HI>Turkish</HI> Altar is plac'd
where you see the Letter B, and instead of Seats,
which the <HI>Turks</HI> never use, there are only the
<HI>Mufti's Mamber,</HI> or the <HI>Katib</HI> of the Mosquee's
Desk, mark'd C, and a <HI>Tebligh,</HI> or little low Bal|cone
for the Singers, mark'd D. Over against the
<HI>Mufti's Mamber</HI> is the Grand Signor's Closet.</P>
<P>The Seats of the <HI>Ambon</HI> were formerly appoin|ted
for those that officiated at the Quire. But the
Preacher's Pulpit might be perhaps where the
<HI>Turks</HI> have now plac'd theirs. It stands in the
midst of the North part of the Church, made after
a different manner from those in our Churches, for
it is open before like a large and very high Elbow
Chair. He that preaches, ascends by means of a
<PB N="124" REF="81">
short pair of Stairs before it, leaving his Shooes
below; and being got up, seats himself like a Tay|lor
upon his Shopboard, and talks to the People,
but with very little motion of the body. This
Pulpit stands at the Letter E; it is all of white
Marble, wrought in transparent work with Roses,
and variety of <HI>Moresco</HI> Ornament.</P>
<P>Behind, and over against this Pulpit, stand four
large Pillars of speckl'd <HI>Egyptian</HI> Marble forty foot
high, and all of a piece, with so little difference in
the turning between the middle and the top, that
'tis no easie thing to discern their diminution, which
makes them appear to be all of one piece: But their
Chapters seem to be of a particular Order, which
may be call'd the <HI>Barbarian Greek.</HI> The Workman
intended to have cover'd them with the Leaves of
<HI>Acanthus,</HI> or the Thistle call'd <HI>Brank Vrsin,</HI> but
miss'd his design through his ill imitation. 'Tis
true, the delicacy of the Tool that carv'd them is
to be admir'd, as being almost all transparent; and
it seems as if the Artist intended to have intermix'd
between the Foliage some certain significant Cha|racters.
The upper part of the Chapter, that
forms the space between the Arches, is of various
colour'd Marble wrought in transparent work,
with several branches of Foliage and Flowers, and
Garlands of Porphyry.</P>
<P>These four great Columns support six others be|longing
to the first Galleries, some of which are ra|ther
for Ornament than Use. Those six Columns at
the Letter G, are much less than the four lowermost,
and the Shape and Sculpture of their Chapters is also
different. The upper part of the Columns belonging
to the Women slower Gallery is very rich, and good
work, branch'd with Flowers and Foliage made of
Jasper, Porphyry, Mother of Pearl, and other such|like
<PB N="125" REF="82">
Stones of great price. But it is impossible to
distinguish or express all these Embellishments by
the Graver's Art upon a Copper Plate. Above
these Ornaments there runs a Gallery round about
the Church, with its Balisters, in the distance be|tween
every one of which stands so many Lamps,
which are kept burning all Night long during <HI>Ra|mazan,</HI>
or the Season of Lent. This Balister is
the last piece of Building, which is lin'd with
Marble within the Church. The upper part was
formerly all embellish'd with Figures in Mosaic
work, as appears by the Ruins of it in several pla|ces,
the rest being now defac'd by the Turks, who
cease not to blemish and destroy what remains,
where they can come at it, with long Poles, and
then to daub the deformity over with white Plai|ster.
Which they have not done however so abso|lutely,
but that several Figures appear untouch'd
out of their reach, as well in the first Galleries, as
in the body of the Church: For there are still to
be seen two large Seraphims under the East part of
the <HI>Domo,</HI> four Saints, and a Virgin in the middle,
under the Oriental Arch, mark'd with the Letter I;
two large Angels, and the <HI>Veronica</HI> or Napkin, with
the Picture of Christ's face upon it, at the Letters
M and L, over the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum;</HI> and lastly,
a large Picture of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> sitting in a
Throne, holding Christ upon her knees, who gives
her his Blessing. This Picture appears at the bot|tom
of the Church near the Letter N, in the midst
of a Semidome inlaid with Mosaic work gilded, and
illuminated with five small Windows. These may
be look'd upon as a good Omen for the Christians,
that by an effect of Divine Providence, those
Sculptures which cover'd the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum</HI>
are still remaining entire to this day, though they
<PB N="126" REF="83">
stand in a place very much frequented, and within
the reach of Mischief, as being left there to excite
one day the Piety of the Christians for the reco|very
of the Church. Over this Balcone runs the
upper Balustrade mark'd O, but the lower Balu|strade
terminates under the Angels at an Overture,
which serves instead of a Door.</P>
<P>Over this upper Balustrade, under the Grand
<HI>Domo,</HI> at the Letter g, were formerly seven open
Arches, which belong'd to the Women's second
Gallery; but now those Arches are stopp'd up,
only their place and form remains, in regard the
<HI>Turks,</HI> who never admit their Women into their
Mosquees, have no occasion for so many Galleries
to accommodate their Piety; and have therefore
appointed those Galleries which formerly belong'd
to them, to the use of the Men. Over these Ar|ches
thus stopp'd up, mark'd with the Letter F, are
the Windows of the two Fronts of the Body of the
Church, though very ill contriv'd. The seven
lowermost are very small, but the five which are
over them very large; but as well the Glass-work
of those Windows, as of all the rest of the Church,
except the six in the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI> is only
compos'd of round quarrels of Glass set in plain
Plaister, which is the reason that the whole Church
is very dark and gloomy, notwithstanding the
great number of Windows, which are all low, and
such as afford but little light, and resemble rather
the Vent-holes of a Cave, than the Windows of a
Church.</P>
<P>The spaces between the Windows are so many
portions of Circles or Arches, which as they dimi|nish,
terminate toward the middle of the <HI>Domo,</HI>
where they make the figure of a Rose inlaid with
Mosaic work. From the middle, and the parts
<PB N="127" REF="83">
about this Rose, mark'd with a &cross;, descend several
Rods of Iron, at which hangs a large Circle within
about eight or ten foot of the Pavement, to which
are fix'd a prodigious number of Lamps, Ostriches
Eggs, and other Baubles; but in regard it is no part
of the Building, and for that it would have hinder'd
the prospect of the Church, I have left them out
of the Plate.</P>

WE are now to leave the Church, where
I am sorry I have so long detain'd the
Reader; and therefore seeing the Doors are open,
let him consider at which he will go out. I must
confess he has this advantage above me, that he may
take a prospect of them without any hazard, or
being misus'd for his pains by the zealous Mussel|men,
as I was; for I had finish'd all my work, but
only the Gates, and some few things relating to the
Ground-work of the Church, and lowest part of
the lower <HI>Portico:</HI> To which purpose my long
Beard and Habit, with my red Turbant, (for none
but Musselmen are suffer'd to wear white or green)
stood me in great stead. For in that Equipage I
durst venture into the <HI>Sophia,</HI> without notice taken
of me by the <HI>Turks,</HI> whose Eyes are so zealously
fix'd upon the Pavement, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hat they take little heed
whether a Man's Turbant be Christian or Turkish.
Nevertheless one day trusting too much to my Ha|bit,
and the Excuses which I had always ready cut
and dry'd, I could not be content to go alone as I
was wont to do, but I must needs take a friend along
with me, who was a <HI>Venetian,</HI> and who in a whole
year that he had liv'd at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> had never
dar'd so much as to look into the inside of the
Mosquee. As for his habit, it was well enough, but
he wore long Hair, with a <HI>Calpac</HI> or <HI>Grecian</HI> Bonnet
upon his head, after the manner of the <HI>Europeans</HI>
that live in <HI>Turky.</HI> Now having that day little to
do, I carry'd him, forsooth, into the <HI>Portico,</HI> with
a design to have gone cross the Church. But my
friend, when he had seen as much as could be seen
from the <HI>Portico,</HI> out of his <HI>Venetian</HI> Gravity, would
not venture to expose himself any farther, by ha|zarding
a dispute with the zealous <HI>Mahometans:</HI> So
<PB N="130" REF="85">
that he left me to go by my self, and stay'd at the
Door to be a testimony of my rashness, not drea|ming
that he should be the cause of the misfortune
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hat befell me.</P>
<P>For while I was got into the middle of the
Mosquee, and still making forward to the Door
next the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> two curs'd Bigots of <HI>Turks,</HI> that
were coming to say their Prayers, found the <HI>Vene|tian</HI>
at the Church door, under the roof of the
<HI>Portico,</HI> where I left him. They ask'd him, whe|ther
he were come there to turn Musselman? To
which, when he answer'd in the Negative, and told
them, that he only stay'd for his friend that was
gone into the Mosquee, a suddain transportation of
Zeal enflaming the two <HI>Turks,</HI> the one falls upon the
<HI>Venetian</HI> with his prophane Fists, and expells him
out of Holy Ground, while the other makes to|wards
me with his Papo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ches in his hand, and with|out
the least warning, gives me a rude Complement
over the shoulders, for which I return'd him thanks
with the swiftest pair of heels I could find. I did
not think it safe to stand upon Interrogatories, or
to inform my self of the reason of his incivility. I
thought it more advantageous for me to trust to
my Legs, than to stay to tell the boystrous <HI>Turk</HI> by
way of Remonstrance, That if <HI>Mahomet</HI> comman|ded
him to stand barefoot in the Mosquee, yet that
I did not believe he ever intended that any <HI>Turk</HI>
should make use of his Shooes to abuse a Stranger
in his presence. No &mdash; I ran away with all the
speed I could, and fearing less the durtying my <HI>Me|stes</HI>
or new Breeches, than to be defil'd by the rude
touch of a Musselman's fist, I never left running
till I got to the turning of the Street, where I put
on my <HI>Papouches</HI> or Shooes, which 'till then I had no
leisure to do. Had these <HI>Turks</HI> known that I some
<PB N="131" REF="85">
days before had eaten Bacon and drank Wine in
their Mosquee, 'tis ten to one they would not so ea|sily
have suffer'd me to win the Race.</P>
<P>To return to the Matter. The West part of
<HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> where stand the Gates of the <HI>Portico</HI>
at which I got out, is one of the fairest Fronts of
the Church, as may be easily seen by the draught.
Over the West Arch, which leans upon the two
great Pillars that support the <HI>Domo,</HI> you meet
with a large Semidome, which covers both upon
the right and left hand two other small ones, which
are as it were instead of a Shoulder to the entrance
into the Church. It had formerly five Windows,
but now one is stopp'd up. Between these two El|bows
cover'd by their Semidomes, appear the three
principal Doors of the <HI>Portico,</HI> being plac'd in
the middle of the West Front, and between six
other Doors equally divided upon the right and
left hand. That in the middle, which is the big|gest
of all, is mark'd in the Design with the Letter
A. The two other, (which are lower) by B.
Near to which are two passages, which cross over
the Pillars that flank them, leading to the three
other Doors of each side. Through the great
Door you may discover another answering to it,
and leading into the <HI>Nartex</HI> or <HI>Portico.</HI></P>
<P>Over these three Doors are three large Over|tures
adjoyning to the two sides of the Pillars that
flank the Front, and in the middle rest upon two
double Columns. Through which three Arches
you may discover a good part of the upper <HI>Portico</HI>
which belong'd to the Women's Gallery. In the
midst of which stand four little Pillars of green
Marble, only for shew, or else perhaps they might
have formerly serv'd to make a separation between
some Window or Lattice, which prevented the
<PB N="132" REF="86">
Women from being seen. The upper part of this
Front, over the middlemost Doors, is taken up
with a large Window parted by two Columns,
and cut in the midst by a piece of Stone-work, the
Glass-work consisting only of round Quarrels set
in Plaister. The Ornaments of this Front, and of
all the rest of the Body of the Church, are of
Marble, Alablaster, green Marble, and Porphyry,
Mother of Pearls, Cornelions, and several other
rich Stones. I have observ'd, to the utmost of my
power, the order and fashion of all these Orna|ments
beautifi'd with such diversity of rich Mate|rials;
but the smallness of the Volume to which I
was oblig'd to accommodate the Plates, would not
give me leave to make a larger distinction of the
several parts. However, if this small Design prove
acceptable to the World, I may in time be able to
gratifie the Reader with a Des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ription in larger
Draughts. In the mean time, the Reader may be
assur'd of all the exactness imaginable, and the va|rious
colours of the Marble may be discern'd by
the variety of the Graver's hatching in the Plate.</P>
<P>Upon the side of these three middlemost Doors,
the two little Pillars which flank them form a kind
of Elbow, by the assistance of the two great Pil|lars
which sustain the <HI>Domo;</HI> in the midst of which
Elbow or Semicircle are two Columns of Por|phyry,
each plac'd upon a Pedestal, equalling in
height the third part of the body of the Pillar.
But in regard these two Columns that sustain three
Arches with their Pillars, support also five others,
which make way for six Overtures, upon which
are fix'd the Semidomes and their Galleries, the
bulk whereof render'd their weight too ponderous,
the ensuing Earthquakes shook them so terribly&punc;
that they began to falter in many places, which
<PB N="133" REF="86">
constrain'd the girdling them about with Hoops of
Brass and Iron, to prevent their total decay.</P>
<P>Between these two girdl'd Columns, upon each
side, stand two great Jarrs or Urns of Marble,
having little Cocks belonging to them. These are
fill'd every morning with Water from the Cistern,
drawn up at the little Overture mark'd F, and co|ver'd
with brass Covers. If these two brass Urns
be not very ancient, yet it may be conjectur'd, that
they serve in the stead of those which were in the
time of the <HI>Greek</HI> Emperours, and were made use
of for the Sanctification Water which the Chri|stians
us'd when they came to Church. For Hi|story
observes, that there was a certain large Ves|sel
full of Water, where the Faithful were wont
to wash their faces, to denote, that they were to
present themselves pure and immaculate before the
Presence of God; which Vessel seems to be repre|sented
by the Holy-Water-vessels in the Roman
Catholic Churches; as having written over it in
a fair Golden Character this <HI>Greek</HI> Verse, which
may be read either backward or forward:
<Q><L><GAP DESC="foreign">.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Wash off thy Sins, and not thy Face alone.</L></Q>
But now they only serve to keep Water in, to
quench the Musselmen's zealous Drowth. For the
most superstitious <HI>Turks</HI> tarry a long time at their
Devotions, and by means of their frequent Ge|sticulations,
and Genuflexions, and tearing their
Throats with continually pronouncing the Name
of God, or some one of his Attributes, overheat
themselves in such a manner, that their Lungs are
almost dry'd up with perpetual yawling; which
makes them pant after the cool Streams of these
<PB N="134" REF="87">
Water-Urns, whence they either take the Water
themselves, or receive it from the hands of a <HI>Der|vich,</HI>
or some other Officers of the Mosquee, who
stand ready with their <HI>Toulouks</HI> or Hair-bottles,
and clean Glasses, to supply the wants of them
that call for their assistance; but this is only upon
Solemn Festivals, when the Mosquee is so full, that
every one cannot go to relieve himself.</P>
<P>Near the mouth of the great Cistern at the
Letter E, as also right against it, stands a little
Marble Terrass upon four Pillars of the same,
very like the Balcones where the Musicians in <HI>Italy</HI>
sit, only the Balisters are much lower, to the end
the People may observe the Gestures of those that
are in it, who are the Directors of the <HI>Turkish</HI>
Devotion, by the Musselmen call'd <HI>Bellighler,</HI> as
their Seats or Terrasses are call'd <HI>Tebligh;</HI> which
Seats or Terrasses, and Chanters or Directors, are
only in great Mosquees, for the little ones have no
need of so much Ceremony. The <HI>Katib</HI> who is
the Curat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, or the <HI>Iman</HI> his Vicar, are sufficient
in such places; and for the Country Mosquees, as
in our small Parishes, one single <HI>Iman</HI> serves to do
all the drudgery of <HI>Iman, Muezin</HI> or Cryer, <HI>Lamp-lighter</HI>
or <HI>Muchtar,</HI> and <HI>Kahigim</HI> or Sweeper.
But in large and much frequented Mosquees, such
as <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> there is a necessity for these Ter|races;
for that the Musselmen, who are at a
distance from the <HI>Maharab,</HI> would never be able
to hear or understand the <HI>Iman</HI> that reads Prayers,
or to know when to bawl, and when to kneel;
which causes great confusion many times, not un|pleasant
to behold; when one going to kneel, and
another to rise at the same time, he that rises sa|lutes
him that is about to kneel with the poynt of
his Turbant, to the great detriment sometimes of
<PB N="135" REF="87">
Eyes, sometimes of Noses; which cannot but be
a great disturbance to their offended Devotion.
Therefore the Directors placing themselves in
these Terraces, and observing the voice and ge|stures
of the <HI>Iman,</HI> baul out to the Crowd what
the <HI>Iman</HI> reads with a low voice, and teach the
Rabble when to respond, in due season, at the
end of every <HI>Rekies,</HI> or Couplet of the Prayer, <HI>Alla
Ecber,</HI> and to prostrate themselves in their proper
cue, after their Example.</P>
<P>And thus I have said as much as can be said in
reference to the inside and outside of the Church
of <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> referring my self, to supply the
defect of words, to the observation of the Plates,
which he that shall diligently consider, will find that
the Body of this Church is in nothing at all less
glorious than it was formerly, notwithstanding all
the Stories of the <HI>Greeks</HI> to the contrary, unless
it be where the <HI>Turks</HI> have defac'd it upon the score
of their Superstition: For I look not upon the
destruction of the Patriarch's Palace, or the Mo|nastery
adjoyning, to signifie much to the Body of
the Church. As to the Front of the Church, there
is no probability, that there ever was any other
than what now appears, which has nothing of
that Grandeur and Beauty, which a Church so
loudly fam'd might justly require. True it is,
that <HI>Architecture,</HI> and her two Sisters, <HI>Sculpture</HI>
and <HI>Painting,</HI> were at that time little regarded,
so that it seems rather a wonder that they did
<HI>so well,</HI> than that they did <HI>no better,</HI> considering
the barbarity and ignorance of the Age.</P>

<P>IT is a Question hard to determine, what was
the true Liturgy, or form of Divine Worship
of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> in the time of the first Christian
Emperours, or what it was a long time after them.
The Ancients, as well in this, as in many other
things, give us little or no light. But if we may
make any conjecture, by what is now practic'd
over all the <HI>Greek</HI> Churches, we may conclude,
that the Governours, Ministers, and Officers of
the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, were comprehended under three
Orders; <HI>Episcopa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, Sacerdotal,</HI> and <HI>Clerical.</HI> Un|der
the Episcopal Order were the Patriarch, the
Archbishops, Metropolitans, and Bishops. The

their Brethren, Regular Priests, and <HI>Cosmics</HI> or
Secular Priests. The Clerical Order contain'd as

<HEAD>Of the Patriarch.</HEAD>
<P>THE Patriarch of <HI>Constantinople</HI> has not al|ways
been invested with that high Title.
<HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">trophanes</HI> was the first to whom it was allow'd,
as being no more than a private Bishop, 'till <HI>Con|stantine</HI>
<PB N="137" REF="88">
constrain'd <HI>Byzantium</HI> to surrender to him
upon Composition, and to expell <HI>Licinius,</HI> who had
taken Sanctuary there, and whose Party they had
embrac'd. Nor was the <HI>Byzantine</HI> Bishop any
more than a Suffragan to the Metropolitan, or
Primate of <HI>Heraclea;</HI> wherein he had only ran
the same fortune with the City, which was by <HI>Se|verus</HI>
compell'd to truckle under the Jurisdiction
of the Commonwealth of <HI>Heraclea</HI> her Rival, for
having befriended <HI>Pescennius Niger</HI> his Enemy.</P>
<P>But when <HI>Constantine</HI> had once made it the Me|tropolitan
Seat of the Empire, then it was that
the Bishops of <HI>Byzantium</HI> obtain'd the sole Title
of Patriarch. Afterwards prompted by that Sin
of Vain-glory so common to Mankind, and so na|tural
to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> though they had receiv'd that
Title only in consideration and out of respect to
the Emperours, yet they claim'd all those Rights
and Priviledges which they thought were any way
due to their new Dignity. And so powerfully
they sollicited the Emperour, that the Pope, sull
fore against his will, was forc'd to grant them not
only such demands, for which they had some
grounds of Reason, but also the Primacy over all
the three other Patriarchs of <HI>Antiochia, Alexandria,</HI>
and <HI>Ierusalem;</HI> and in regard that <HI>Constantinople</HI>
was in <HI>Thrace,</HI> that Province also was given him,
with several others which were formerly under
the Jurisdiction of <HI>Rome,</HI> to which they had been
annex'd by the Indulgence of the Emperours long
before the fourth General Council, in the year
451. After whic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">, these Patriarchs having usurp'd
the large Provinces of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Pontus,</HI> which ap|pertain'd
to the Patriarch of <HI>Antiochia,</HI> the Pope
was constrain'd to grant them absolute Ecclesiasti|cal
Independency; and to confirm this Grant au|thentic
<PB N="138" REF="89">
and inviolable by a Canon of the fifth
Council, which was the second of the General
Councils held at <HI>Constantinople</HI> in the year 553.
The Primacy over all the other Patriarchates was
likewise at the sollicitation of the Emperour <HI>Iu|stinian</HI>
confirm'd them in the same Council.</P>
<P>But however they obtain'd their Jurisdiction, it
was of a large extent, as having under them
20 Archbishops, 24 Metropolitans, and a great
number of Bishops. Nor have they who enjoy
the Dignity at this day less, only the Revenue of
so many Prelatures comes much short of what it
was, though the people under their several Dio|cesses
give them much more than what formerly
they did.</P>
<P>Since Vain-glory and Simony became Masters of
the Patriarchate, all these Prelates are constrain'd
to reimburse the person, who to clamber over his
Predecessor's head, gives never so much Money to
the Grand Signor. Which is the reason, that
whereas the Emperours formerly gave great Pre|sents
to the Patriarchs, to gain by their means the
favour of the People under their Jurisdiction, they
now receive vaster Sums from them; which daily
encreasing through the exorbitant Ambition of the
Patriarchs, will soon enhance the price so high,
that in a short time it will be a difficult thing for all
<HI>Greece</HI> to raise the Sum demanded. In the space of
two years that I stay'd at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> two diffe|rent
Patriarchs gave for the Patriarchship, the
one fifty, the other sixty thousand Crowns, as a
Present to the Grand Signor. Considerable Sums
for the <HI>Caloyers,</HI> who profess the Vow of Poverty,
and ought to enjoy nothing of Propriety. Never|theless
when any of these Monks can meet with a
rich Merchant, which will advance part of the
<PB N="139" REF="89">
Money, they propose their design to the Grand
vizier, who fails not to grant the Title to him
that gives most, and having receiv'd the Present,
gives him the <HI>Barat</HI> or Grand Signor's Letters Pa|tents,
by vertue of which the old Patriarch is dis|plac'd,
and the new one settl'd in his room, with
order to the <HI>Greeks</HI> to obey him, and to pay with
all speed the Debts contracted, under the penalties
of Bastinadoing, Confiscation, and shutting up their
Churches. Which Order is presently sent to all
the Archbishops and Metropolitans, who give im|mediate
notice thereof to their Suffragans: Who
laying hold on the opportunity, tax the <HI>Caloyers</HI>
and People under their Jurisdiction, the sum as|sess'd
by the Patriarch, and something more,
under pretence of Expences and Presents extra|ordinary.</P>
<P>Yet though the Promotion be thus irregular,
they give the Title of <HI>Panagiotita Sou</HI> to this very
Patriarch, when they make their Addresses to
him, that is to say, <HI>Your All-Holiness,</HI> or <HI>Your most
Supreme Holiness,</HI> so soon as he has taken possession
of his Dignity, of which this is the Ceremony:
The aspiring <HI>Caloyer,</HI> having notice that his Let|ters
Patents are ready, hastens to the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> or
to the <HI>Caymacan</HI>'s house, with two or three Bishops
of his own gang; where being arriv'd, and having
kiss'd in most humblewise the lowest part of the
Governours Garments, the Grand Signor's Provi|sions
are read to him; then having put on over his
<HI>Caloyer</HI>'s black Habit, not much different from that
of the Benedictines, two Vestments of vary-colour'd
Tissue, which the Grand Signor presents him, he
gets on Horseback with the Bishops in his train,
who are jackpudding'd in the same Dress, and in
this Equipage they ride from the Serraglio to the
<PB N="140" REF="90">
Patriarchal Church, which is about half a League
off. The whole Cavalcade consists of no more
than a dozen persons, that is to say, a <HI>Capigi,</HI> two
<HI>Chiaux's,</HI> the Caymacan's <HI>Kiaia</HI> or Secretary, and
some Janisaries that march before. Behind come
the Bishops and some few Caloyers of his Faction,
in a habit, fitter for a Masquerade, than the Train
of a Patriarch.</P>
<P>The Patriarch being arriv'd at the Door of the
Church, which he finds shut, alights off his Horse,
at what time the Vizier's or Caymacan's Secretary
reads the Grand Signor's Letters Patents; which
done, and the Church Doors being open'd, the Se|cretary
leads him in, and having plac'd him in the
Patriarchal Seat, the whole Cavalcade returns from
whence they came in the same order as they went.
And thus the Patriarch enjoys the peaceable posses|sion
of his Dignity, 'till a Crotchet comes into the
pate of some other <HI>Caloyer,</HI> to offer the t'other
ten thousand Crowns, and then good night <HI>Nicholas</HI>
to his dear purchas'd Honour.</P>
<P>When all the Ceremony is over, all the Officers
of the Church come to kiss the new Patriarch's
hands, and to complement him with the <HI>Polychronos
ti Panagiotita sou,</HI> like the Cimplement to the
<HI>Roman</HI> Pontiff <HI>Ad multos annos.</HI> After this, Com|mand
is sent to all the <HI>Greek</HI> Prelates throughout
the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, to satisfie without delay the
Tax which the new Patriarch has impos'd upon
them, unless they intend that others shall be sub|stituted
in their places. To such a miserable con|dition
has Schism, Vain-glory, and Simony, reduc'd
the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, that it is now no more than

Books, is the reason that hardly any of the Bishops,
Priests, or <HI>Caloyers,</HI> ever put themselves to the
trouble of reading it. There are none that think
it worth their while, unless it be at Mount <HI>Athos</HI>
or the Holy Mountain, <HI>Neomogni</HI> in the Island of
<HI>Chio,</HI> and some few other well-govern'd Convents:
For all the rest of the <HI>Greek</HI> Clergy presume to
lay it aside of their own accord, without expecting
a Dispensation from the Bishops, who not having
leasure to read it themselves, set them an Example
which they are no less willing to follow.</P>
<P>I should indeed have put the Order of <HI>Caloyers</HI>
before the Bishops, nay the Patriarch himself, since
there is not any who can pretend to those Degrees,
unless he be a <HI>Caloyer.</HI> But in regard it is not the
custom so to do among the <HI>Roman Catholics,</HI> these
honest <HI>Caloyers</HI> shall give me leave for once to place
them in the rank which best becomes their seeming
Humility. Now this I must needs say, that take
away their Ambition and their Vanity, the <HI>Caloyers</HI>
lead most strict and exemplary Lives. Like the
Religious Orders of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> they make
the three Vows of Poverty, Chastity, and Obedi|ence;
and they observe them very exactly, espe|cially
in all the great Convents, <HI>Monte Sina, Sancta
Saba,</HI> St. <HI>Michael</HI> of <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> and those before
mention'd. To this purpose they never eat Meat,
<PB N="143" REF="91">
but live upon Pulse, Herbs, and Fruits, which they
manure themselves in the Lands adjoyning to their
Convents. They who are near the Sea, may eat
Fish, unless it be in Lent, and then it is a Sin so much
as to mention the words <HI>Fish, Butter,</HI> or <HI>Cheese,</HI> with|out
the following Parenthesis, <HI>Timi tis agias Saraco|stis;
With respect to the holy Lent be it spoke.</HI> And
by their Example, the people are no less observers
of that abstemious Season.</P>
<P>All these <HI>Caloyers</HI> being compriz'd under the
three Orders of St. <HI>Basil,</HI> St. <HI>Elias,</HI> and St. <HI>Marcel|lus,</HI>
wear the same Habit, and observe almost all the
same Rule. Every one of these Convents have
their Superiours, the Friers, and the Novices, with
the Lay-Brothers. The Superiour is call'd <HI>Higou|menos</HI>
or Conductor, for the Title of <HI>Archiman|dritis</HI>
or Abbot, is not so much us'd among them.
This <HI>Higoumenos</HI> is very much reverenc'd by the
Monks, especially in the great Monasteries; for in
the lesser where there are several of equal standing,
they have much ado to preserve their Authority,
especially when they enjoyn any displeasing Penance,
farther than such a number of Genuflexions, or Fa|stings.
For as for any other more rigorous, the
Superiours dare not so much as mention them;
fearing if they should threaten the Monks with
severer Punishments, lest they should drive them to
a trick they have got, of not only renouncing their
Superiours authority, but the Christian Religion,
and to make some rash Oath to turn <HI>Turk</HI> by lifting
their hands to Heaven; a Wickedness so frequent
among them, that there is hardly any considerable
Town in all the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, where you shall
not meet some of these <HI>Kachi's Muhammed, Papas
Mustapha, Murat Carabache;</HI> that is to say, several
Monks and Priests, <HI>Armenians, Syrians, Greeks,</HI> and
<PB N="144" REF="92">
others, who throw away their Cassocks and Caps
in exchange for the Turbant, which is of very ill
consequence; for if these people are marry'd, and
happen to have Children, all the Males above 15
years of age are bound to follow their Father's
Religion: Though if they be of riper years, they
are permitted to live at home with their Mothers
and Sisters in the Christian Faith. So that the
fear of losing absolutely those which they would
only chastise according to their merit, causes the
Superiours to be very cautious of inflicting severe
Penances, unless upon such as are willing to submit
to whatever they impose, or are very Criminal in|deed.
To this purpose I shall relate a short Story
which happen'd in <HI>Syria</HI> while I was there.</P>
<P>Near to <HI>Damas</HI> stands a very fair Convent of
Nuns and Monks (I put the Nuns first, because the
place belongs properly to them.) This Monastry
lies five or fix Leagues from <HI>Damas</HI> to the North|west,
dedicated to the holy Virgin under the name
of <HI>Esseid&eacute; Saidnaia.</HI> It is seated one part at the
foot of a Mountain belonging to the Monks, the
other part at the top, belonging to the Nuns.
Both the one and the other wear black, and obey
the Order of St. <HI>Anthony.</HI> Now in regard these
Nuns live much after the same rate of the Nuns
of the <HI>Ave Mary</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> a young Frier weary of
the solitude of his Convent, bethought himself
(under pretence of the begging Trade, which
those honest Virgins drive over all the Jurisdiction
of the Patriarch of <HI>Antiochia</HI>) to take a mumping
Ramble all over <HI>Syria,</HI> but not understanding the
Limits to which the begging Trade of the Con|vent
of <HI>Saidnaia</HI> was confin'd, because he would
not be known near home, he resolv'd to continue
his vagabonding up as far as <HI>Ierusalem.</HI> To which
<PB N="145" REF="92">
prupose he had counterfeited Letters from the Ab|bess
of <HI>Saidnaia,</HI> by vertue of which he had got
together a considerable sum of Money, consi|dering
that Country was none of the most
wealthy in the World. And thus encourag'd,
he was in hopes to loyter on as far as <HI>Tripoli
in Syria,</HI> where he might Embark either for
<HI>Europe</HI> or for <HI>Constantinople,</HI> as he should see con|venient.
But coming to <HI>Dgebel Ageloun,</HI> a large
Mountain encompass'd with small Christian
Villages, he met there at the same time two of the
Patriarch of <HI>Ierusalem's</HI> Money-Collectors, which
that Prelate sends every year into those parts.
Those fellows demanded of him for whom he
begg'd? to whom the Caloyer answer'd, for the
Abbess of <HI>Saidnaia.</HI> Thereupon the <HI>Ierusalem</HI> Col|lectors,
not enduring such an encroachment upon
their territories, sent him to their Patriarch, who
after he had wrote to the Abbess, and receiv'd her
answer, detecting the <HI>Caloyers</HI> falshood, took from
him his habit of Priest and seculariz'd him, as un|worthy
of his profession and the habit which he
wore. And thus the Superiours of Monasteries
in extraordinary cases, for the support of their
dignity, will not stick with ignomy to deprive such
Monks of their habit, who are either obstinately
disobedient, or from whose behaviour they are
afraid of some trouble or ill accident. For they
regard not the Vows which they have made to
live and dye under such an Order, since those Vows
are not made, but at the good pleasure of
the Patriarch and Superiours of the Convent.</P>
<P>The profess'd Monks and other Fathers make no
scruple to do the same; for they quit their habit
as they find most for their advantage. Nay, though
they have been Noviciats at least two years before
<PB N="146" REF="93">
Profession, they many times leave the Convent to
live upon their own Demeanes; or else absolutely
to quit both Habit and Order. For their Vows are
rather a reciprocal engagement which they make
with the Order which they embrace, upon the de|position
of a certain sum of Mony at their entrance,
than any Vow, or any solemn obligation to live
under the strict rules of the Order. Nevertheless
these professed Monks, and all the rest of the Reli|gious
Fathers, labour altogether for the good of
the Convent all the time they live in it. Some take
care of the Fruits, others of the Corn, others of
the Cattel, and generally of every thing that ap|pertains
to the house. To which purpose, they
employ their Novices also more often in the fields
than in the exercises of spiritual meditation and
retirement, to which they apply themselves as
little as to their studies. Which is the reason that
the <HI>Caloyers</HI> are commonly so sottish and ignorant,
that you shall scarcely meet with any in the biggest
Convents who understand any thing of the <HI>Greek</HI>
letters, in which character their service and all their
Prayers are written.</P>
<P>Now the necessity which the <HI>Caloyers</HI> are in to
manure their own Lands, causes them to receive a
great number of lay-Brothers into their Convents,
so many, that they almost equal the number of the
Religious persons. These lay-Brothers spend their
whole time abroad in the fields, never returning
home till the evening; where notwithstanding their
toyl and labour all the day long, they fail not to
assist at a long Prayer, and to make a great number
of <HI>Metaniai,</HI> or genuflections, bowing their knees
to the ground, first down, then up again, then down
again, with a motion so swift as is to be admir'd;
which done, contented with a light Supper, they be|take
<PB N="147" REF="93">
themselves to their repose, which is upon a bed
which is not much softer than the bare boards, ex|pecting
till early Matins and dawning daylight call
them to their wonted labour.</P>
<P>Over all these Religious Monks there are Pro|vincial
Visitors, though much different from
ours in Europe. For ours make their visitations to
hear the complaints of the injur'd, theirs, whom
they call <HI>Exarchi,</HI> never visit the Convents under
their jurisdiction, but to demand the mony which
the Patriarch sends for. So that these poor
<HI>Caloyers</HI> have but an ill time of it, to moyl and
sweat, and to cause their Lay-Brothers to toyl and
labour: For no sooner have they got a little mony
together for the necessities of their house, but the
Patriarch sends his Visitors to discharge them of it.
Yet notwithstanding all these Taxes which the Reli|gious
<HI>Greeks</HI> are bound to pay, there are some Con|vents
in <HI>Turkie</HI> very well endow'd, and some parti|cular
Monks so Rich, that they dare adventure
sometimes to beard the Patriarch himself, and to
buy him out of his Dignity, as I said before, espe|cially
being assisted by the Purse, and cunning
advice of some Rich Merchant, who knows how
to come by his Mony again with good Interest.</P>
<P>Next to the Orderly <HI>Caloyers</HI> and Religious
Priests, follows that of the Seculars, or <HI>Cosmicos Hie|reus.</HI>
I have told ye, that all these sorts of Priests
are usually Marry'd; but some circumstances rela|ting
to their Marriage I have not yet related. So
soon as they have been under the hands of the Eccle|siastical
Barber, who trims generally as they do
among the Catholicks, and that they have serv'd
the Church for some Months, they are admitted
into the number of the <HI>Anagnostai</HI> or <HI>Readers,</HI> being
thereby capacitated to read Mattins, the Psalms,
<PB N="148" REF="94">
and such other things which our Clerks generally
sing. The <HI>Anagnostine</HI> perhaps may be the same
with our four <HI>Minors,</HI> as comprehending all the
Duties which the <HI>Anagnostai</HI> ought to exercise. But
in regard there are other persons employ'd as
Porters, Bell-ringers, and such like Officers, their
imployment is only to read. When I speak of Bell-Ringers
in the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, it is not to be imagin'd
that they are such who Toll their Bells as for|merly.
No, for the <HI>Turks</HI> spoyl'd all the Steeple-Music
in the <HI>Greek</HI> Church. Instead of which, a
certain Instrument call'd a <HI>Simandron,</HI> serves turn,
which is a long narrow piece of Board, upon which
the Officer rattles with a wooden stick, till he make
the Board groan again; the noise of which
assembles the poor Christians together.</P>
<P>When the term of Clerkship is expir'd, the
Bishop ordains him a Deacon, giving him power
to officiate at the Altar, and sing the Epistle, after
which, if the Deacon have a desire to Marry he is
free so to do. Only he must give the Bishop notice
of it, and tell him with all the name and place of the
Virgins abode, to the end he may enquire of her good
qualities, and take particular care that she is hand|some.
For it is requisite that a <HI>Greek</HI> Papa's Wife
have three good properties, Dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">retion, Chastity,
and Beauty. But why more beautiful than Laymen?
The reason is plain. For the Lay-men may Marry
as often and as many as the please, but the <HI>Papa</HI> can
Marry but one, and but once all his life time. And
therefore it is but reason that the <HI>Papa,</HI> who makes
provision at once for all, should have all those good
qualities in one person, which if a Lay-man misses
in one, he may find in an other. And indeed they
are generally very fortunate in their Chaces: For if
there be e're a handsome young Girl in the whole
<PB N="149" REF="94">
Quarter where a Matrimonical Priest is upon the
hunt, every one strives to have him for a Son-in-law:
As if the beauty in the <HI>Grecian</HI> women had been
always consecrated, if not to God, yet to his Mini|sters;
by which the most charming Beauties being
emptied to those whom it behoves to be most pure,
it becomes a Proverb among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> that when
they would praise or flatter a young Lady, they
say, she surpasses in virtue and beauty the fairest
<HI>Papadie.</HI> And true it is, that their beauty is gene|rally
grac'd with a most pleasing modesty, to which
the white vail which they wear upon their heads,
the neatness of their habit, and their harmless
conversation, add such a luster, that it is impossible
but that they should win the affections of their
Husbands. For this reason the young <HI>Papa's</HI> are
permitted to leave their severe employments for
some time, to attend the more delightful pastime
of courtship, and taking order for their Nuptials.
The Ceremonies of which being over, they return
to their Functions, and are admitted into the Order
of <HI>Hiero</HI>- Deacons, with power to read the Gospel,
and officiate at the Altar with the Priest, till he be
in a capacity to be made a Priest himself.</P>
<P>These are the chief Degrees in the <HI>Greek</HI> Church,
the meaner Officers are first, the <HI>Sacristans</HI> or
<HI>Skeuophilakes,</HI> who take care of the sacred Vessels,
and Church-utensils. The second are the <HI>Calonarki,</HI>
that name the Anthems and Songs, and set the
Tunes. The third are the <HI>Tyrori,</HI> or Porters, who
take care to open and unlock the Church Doors;
and the least are the <HI>Candilafti,</HI> that look after the
Lamps.</P>

<PB N="150" REF="95">
<HEAD>Of their Offices.</HEAD>
<P>AS to the Offices themselves, they differ accor|ding
to the custom and Revenues of the place.
In great Convents the Monks rise at Midnight to
read the <HI>Mesonyction.</HI> Which Office lasts generally
two hours. But upon great Festivals the <HI>Mesonyction</HI>
is chang'd into <HI>Olonyction,</HI> which lasts all night. The
institution of that Office was prudently intended
to prepare them for the devotions of the following
day. But many are the abuses crept in, which
might be easily Reform'd, had the <HI>Greek</HI> Church
Pastors as wise and learned as the Latine. Some I
will relate which I have observ'd.</P>
<P>The Feasts that follow this <HI>Holonyction</HI> are either
<HI>Panigyri,</HI> which we call <HI>Fairs;</HI> or <HI>Polyeleon,</HI> which
signifies plenarie Indulgence. To these Feasts there
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ock great numbers of people: And in regard the
most part go more out of custome than devotion,
they carry along with them provision of good
chear, to spend the night merrily. So that the
singers themselves, being generally good fellows
that will not refuse their Cups, fail not to meet
with one good friend or other, that gives them
frequent occasions to take breath, and to make pau|ces
and rests which they do not find in their prick|song.</P>
<P>Being once at <HI>Nenita,</HI> a famous Town in the
Island of <HI>Chio,</HI> upon St. <HI>Michaels</HI> day, there hap|pen'd
the feast of that Arch Angel call'd the <HI>Pane|gyri,
tou Taxiarchi.</HI> At what time a friend of mine
would needs have me go and see the fashion of this
<HI>Holonyction.</HI> The Town, not being above eight
miles from <HI>Chio,</HI> we arriv'd there the Seventh of <HI>Sep|tember,</HI>
which was the Eve of the Feast (for in all the
<PB N="151" REF="95">
<HI>Greek</HI> Churches they follow the ancient Kalenders)
and after a slight Supper, being fasting night, we
went to Church about Ten a Clock, by which time
the Church was so throng'd that we had much ado
to get to the Chanters seat, whither I was resolved
to croud, that I might hear the Melody to the best
advantage. It was near an hour before the Service
began, and there was already such a horrid noise
and confusion, that the <HI>Calonarchi</HI> not being able to
raise their Voices to be heard by those that were
to take the Tune from their Notes, and the <HI>Chanters</HI>
not having their books before them prick'd and
rul'd as in <HI>Europe,</HI> the Music which was not in very
good order was forc'd to crease; so that the <HI>Proto|psalti</HI>
or Rector of the Quire grew angry, and at
length his patience forsaking him, after he had
struck several blows upon the Bench where he sate
with his <HI>Dekaniki</HI> or Deans staff of Authority, he
turn'd to the people and cry'd out as low'd as he
could bawl, <HI>Sopotate Theocatarati; Curst of God,
will ye never hold your Clacks?</HI></P>
<P>The noise of the stick, and the thundering Voice
of the <HI>Ephimerios</HI> or Master of the Quire, begat an
indifferent silence for a while, and gave the Cho|risters
leisure to reharken to the Tune. But pre|sently,
after the <HI>Calonarchi</HI> reading and baulling one
thing, and the <HI>Choristers</HI> Singing and answering
quite another thing, as having sipp'd a little too
much of the creature, put the multitude into such a
hideous strain of Laughter, that now the whole
Church was all in an uproar, nothing but noise
and confusion, and the Choristers were once more
forc'd to put up their Pipes. This hurly burly
endur'd along while, till the <HI>Proto-psalti</HI> horn-mad
began to lay on again with his Battoon, and redoub|ling
his fury, cry'd out a second time, <HI>Sopateda
<PB N="152" REF="96">
Fourkismeni, Hang-Dogs be quiet.</HI> For you are to
understand, that these <HI>Papa's</HI> are meer Clowns, and
so regardless of the gravity and decency that belongs
to their functions, that they make slight of cursing
and giving ill Language in the very Church it self,
as being their common way of reproving those that
they find misbehaving themselves in the time of
Divine service. Neither is it so much out of their
zeal, but meerly out of an ill custome and habit
of bad language, that they thus bespatter their
<HI>Parishioners,</HI> which they will not scruple, in their
fury, sometimes to call Rogue and Rascal in the
midst of their Devotions for very slight mis|carriages.</P>
<P>Thus the whole night was spent in an alternative
variation of squealing and singing, ribble rabble,
chat, noise and din, laughing and cursing, with
some lucid intervals of silence and praying, till
Morning slumber having seized the greatest part
of the Congregation, wearied with talk and hard
drinking, they said their Prayers in a little more
tranquillity: Prayers being ended, they went every
one to dress their Victualls, and dinner being ready
they fell to eating and drinking, and so to jumping
and dancing.</P>
<P>But in the better regulated <HI>Convents,</HI> this <HI>Holo|nyction</HI>
is observ'd with greater decency, in regard
they are more carefull to keep out the multit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">de
which cause the disorder. After the <HI>Mesonyction</HI>
Office is over, which lasts till within two hours of
Morning, the Monks return to their Cells till Five
of the Clock, at what time they begin their <HI>Mattins</HI>
and <HI>Hymns,</HI> together with the <HI>Prime,</HI> which is always
Sung at break of day; for they still so order the
Service, that the <HI>Prime</HI> is always sung at Sun-rising.
Which being done, every one retires to his Cell or
<PB N="153" REF="96">
to his labour, till Nine of the Clock; at which
time they return to Chappel to sing the Ten a
Clock Noon Prayers, and to say Mass: Which
finish'd, the Monks retire to the Refectory, where
there is a Lecture read' em as they sit at Dinner. As
they rise from Table, both Morning and Evening,
the Cook falls upon his Knees, and as if he expected
the reward of his pains or the pardon of his faults,
he cryes out to the Monks as they pass by him,
<HI>Eulogite Pateres, your blessing good Fathers!</HI> to which
every one makes answer, <HI>Theos Syncoresi, God bless
thee.</HI> Thence they retire to their Chambers, or to
work, as they please, till Four a Clook, at what
time the <HI>Simandron</HI> calls 'em again to Chappel,
where they finish Evening Service, and go to Supper
at six; Supper done, they return to Chappel, to
read the Service which they call <HI>Apodipho,</HI> the
after Supper-Service; which being concluded, at
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ight every one retires to his repose till Mid|night.
At what time they have no occasion to
spend much time in dressing, in regard they lye in
their Cloaths, putting off only their upper Gar|ment:
There being none but the <HI>Europeans</HI> that
make use of Sheets in <HI>Turkie.</HI></P>
<P>Now in regard the <HI>Caloyers</HI> are they who enjoy the
principal dignities in the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, therefore all
other Priests are conformable to their example;
which is the reason they never say above one Mass
in a day, let there be never so many Priests in the
Convent. So that the <HI>Roga</HI> or Salarie of Twenty
or Thirty Crowns a year, which the Church-Wardens
pay to the Priest, is only for his assisting
at the <HI>Office,</HI> and not for saying Mass, which the
people hardly understand, so that a great number
come when it is half over, and others when it is
quite ended. Nor do they who come last any way
<PB N="154" REF="97">
strive to excuse their sluggishness, believing it
enough to go in and look upon the Church, and
make a few genuflections and so home again; for
they cry, <HI>God's compassionate, he'l be merciful to those
that hear but half, and save those that come when all's
done.</HI></P>
<P>This may seem to be a kind of shadow of the
ancient Divine Worship in the Temple of <HI>Sancta
Sophia,</HI> if we may be permitted to take our obser|vation
from what is now in practice; but certain it
is, that they are fallen into an infinite number of
errours, through the extream ignorance of their
Priests, who either uphold the people, or precipitate
them into all the superstitious abuses of true Reli|gion,
which a disorder'd and irregular ignorance
can be guilty of; either to satisfy the silly devotion
of the ill-instructed multitude, or their own par|ticular
Interest, and profound sin of Avarice, which
is too deeply rooted in the whole Priesthood. All
which abuses may be mainly attributed to the little
respect they shew to God in their Churches, and
the extream obstinacy wherewith they persist in
their opinions. The first plunges them into a
great number of miscarriages under pretence of
Religion, and the second will not permit them to
acknowledge their errours. I shall here insert
some few Examples both of the one and the
other.</P>
<P>I came to the Island of <HI>Zant,</HI> during the time of
the <HI>Greeks</HI> Easter, at what time rather at the Insti|gation
of my curiosity than devotion, I was re|solv'd
to stay the whole <HI>Office</HI> out, which they
sing at that Festival. To this purpose I was oblig'd
to go at Three a Clock in the Morning to the
<HI>Greek</HI> Church, which is call'd <HI>il Domo de Greci,</HI>
though it be not the Cathedral of that place, in
<PB N="155" REF="97">
regard the <HI>Greek</HI> Bishop, in whose Diocess lyes the
Island of <HI>Zant,</HI> resides as <HI>Cephalonia.</HI> That Mor|ning
the <HI>Proto-papas,</HI> or chief Priest, began the
<HI>Office</HI> at Four a Clock in the Morning, which lasted
till Nine; though in other places, where they are
more pester'd with <HI>Turks,</HI> they begin at Midnight
or sooner, to the end they may have done by break
of day. But in all that time I did not observe,
neither in the Gestures of the Priest, nor in the
Prayers themselves, any thing that could inspire
the least devotion into a man. Every thing was
done with so little decency or Reverence, that I did
not much admire at what afterwards happen'd.
The Sun being up, and the Priest in the middle of
the Office, I was strangely surpriz'd to hear the
noise of so many Pistols and small fire Armes let
off, and at the same time a confused cry, <HI>Christos
Anesti, Christ is Risen:</HI> But this surprize of mine in
a very short time turn'd into as violent a laughter,
which I could not forbear upon this <HI>Occasion.</HI> A
hairbrain'd sootish young fellow, who stood very
near a <HI>Papa,</HI> taking no notice when he let off his
Pistoll, that the good old man had a great head of
hair and a stately long Beard, according to the
custome of all the <HI>Greek</HI> Priests, fir'd his Pistol so
near to the <HI>Papa's</HI> reverend bush, that his Locks and
Beard were all in a suddain flame: Which caus'd
such a vast disturbance in the midst of Divine Ser|vice,
not a little interrupted before by the noise of
the Pistolls, that it would have afforded sport to
any man, that had not been under the same con|sternation
of Bacon-singeing, that possess'd the poor
afflicted <HI>Papa.</HI> This Ceremony, first brought into
use to testify their joy as well for their being rid
of a meager Lent, as for the hopes of Resurrection,
which that Feast confirms to all Christians, is
<PB N="156" REF="98">
observ'd not only in the Island of <HI>Zant,</HI> but also
over all <HI>Turkie</HI> and the <HI>Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hipelago;</HI> and though it
never be observ'd, without some fatal disorder,
yet the <HI>Greek</HI> Priests never speak a word of sup|pressing
it as an abuse crept into the Church, no
more than they do of another Ceremonious custom
as idle, for the Priest to give about a cup of strong
water to all persons that are so happy to stand in
his quarter. On the other side, finding that the
Toleration of these follies gains the affection,
and opens the purses of their Parishioners, they
are so far from abolishing the old, that they strive
every day to introd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ce new superstitions that may
any way contribute to satisfy their natural and in|herent
Avarice. Of which the <HI>Polykirion</HI> is an evident
proof. This is a Ceremonie not unlike that which
is us'd upon <HI>Candlemas</HI> day among the <HI>Latines,</HI> and
falls out to be observ'd twice a year, upon the <HI>E|phiphani</HI>
and at <HI>Easter;</HI> for these being the two
most noted Holy-days among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and which
therefore bring the greatest numbers of people to
Church, the Priests took an opportunity to in|troduce
a Ceremony that every person should re|ceive
from them a Wax-Candle, which cost them
no more than Three or Four <HI>Sous</HI> a piece, but for
which the people Ten or Eight at least. 'Tis true
they give the Children small pitiful Taylors fear|ing
Candles for nothing, which as their Parents
take for a great favour, so it keeps them from diving
into the Cheat.</P>
<P>The <HI>Papa's</HI> have another stratagem to milk their
Parishioners by means of their <HI>Sphragides</HI> or mark'd
Loaves. The secular Priests carry every one of
them to Church a Houshould loaf, and the Clerks
and Deacons having cut it into small pieces, the
Priest blesses them, as he distributes to all the Con|gregation.
<PB N="157" REF="98">
This is observ'd upon all Holy-days
and <HI>Sundays</HI> toward the people. But the Priests
having thus engag'd the Multitude, and unwilling
to lose by their charity and benedictions, put this
trick upon 'em the first <HI>Sunday</HI> in every Lent, to
reimburse themselves. For then every Family
covetous of the <HI>Papa's</HI> Blessing, Bakes and brings
to Church, a little Loaf made in the form of a
Cross, of which the four extream parts are like a
Lozenge, and the middle part round; and every
part mark'd with the name of <HI>Iesus</HI> thus, <GAP DESC="foreign">.
These Loaves the Priest takes, and having blest
them, breaks one Loaf into five parts, and gives
them to five several people: Now in regard those
pieces being thus blest are presently endu'd with
secret vertues, equal to all the Charms, Antidotes
and Amulets in the world, therefore the people
are oblig'd to pay for every mark'd piece six blanks,
by which means one blessed Bun, which costs them
nothing, in regard every Family provides their own
Loaf, produces them being divided to five persons,
no less than Twelve or Thirteen <HI>Sous;</HI> which is a
very good blessing-interest.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding all these petty cheats and
several others which the Priests impose upon the
people, to pinch mony out of their pockets, those
poor Christians are the most zealous to obey their
orders and injunctions of any people in the world,
and to give them whatever they demand. They
firmly believe that a <HI>Papa</HI> can never tell a lye, and
that no Oracle spoke such truth as what a <HI>Greek</HI>
Priest utters, whatever his ignorance, and how low
and self Interested soever his soul may be. It is
impossible to make a Levantine acknowledge, that
the Bishops, Priests, and other Ministers of their
Church, being so lumpishly dull and sottish as they
<PB N="158" REF="99">
are, are uncapable of instructing them in matters
of Faith which are above their reach. And there|fore
they choose rather blindly to obey their com|mands,
than to suffer themselves to be better
taught, or convinc'd of their errours.</P>

<HEAD>Of their Faith.</HEAD>
<P>AS for what concerns their Faith, they neither
know what they believe, nor what it is they
ought to believe. Their <HI>Papa's</HI> never speak a word of
Catechisms, Articles of Faith, of Hope, or Charity;
or if at any time a <HI>Papa</HI> mounts the Pulpit, 'tis not
so much to make a pious exhortation to the people,
nor to direct them how to lead their lives like
Christians, nor so much as to read a good Homily
which is more easy, but to gain the Two Crowns
which is generally given to the Preacher for his
Sermon, which as the people do not understand, so
neither do the <HI>Papa's</HI> know what they say. And
which is more, they draul out their words at such a
distance one from another, that though they stand
a full hour in their Pulpits, yet they hardly utter
Four Hundred words in all the time. Nevertheless
they are in high esteem, and the poor people that
understand not, nay some that heard not a word
the <HI>Papa</HI> said, cry one to an other as they go home,
<HI>Psila Emiliseno Didascalos. What a rare Preacher was
this, what wonderful things has he said!</HI> Thereupon I
once ask'd some of their Adorers what it was they
so much admir'd, and what it was their Parson had
told them, that was so charming to their ears?
But when I found that not one of them could remem|ber
the least tittle of what they so highly commen|ded,
I made answer, <HI>Psila Emiliseno Didascalos diati|den

<HEAD>Of their Sacraments.</HEAD>
<P>COncerning the Administration of the Sacra|ments,
they are by them administred after a
manner so different and disagreeing from the first
Institution of the sacred Mysterie, that you would
swear they either believe not in what they do, or else
that they take little care of what they are about.
They number Seven Sacraments, but to make short
work of it, they administer but Three. <HI>Baptisme, Con|firmation,</HI>
and the <HI>Eucharist;</HI> they give them all
together to Infants Forty days after the birth;
sometimes later, sometimes sooner, at the pleasure
of the Parents, or as necessity requires. <HI>Penitence, Ex|tream

<HI>Peter's,</HI> St. <HI>Paul's,</HI> the <HI>Assumption of our Lady,</HI> and
<HI>Christmas;</HI> the <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Marriage</HI> they confirm both
together, and upon the same person.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Baptisme;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Baptisme</NOTE> when the Child is in a
condition to be Baptiz'd, they make choise of a
Godfather and Godmother, if it be a Boy; if a
Girl, they many times content themselves with a
Godmother only. Then the Infant is carry'd to
Church, where he is plunged over head and ears in
the <HI>Colymbitra</HI> or Font of Baptisme. Which done,
the Godfather carry's the Child, Midwife-like,
to the great door of the Sanctuary, where they
anoint the Childs head, neck, stomach, shoulders,
armpits, hands, elbows, leggs and feet: Which
done, they put upon the Infant a white shirt, and
wastcoate, and such other accoutrements as are re|quisite,
which they never put off in eight days
after. At what time the Godfather and Godmother
carry the Child again to Church, there to have all
<PB N="160" REF="100">
the Childs swaths and linnen wash'd, which he has
foul'd during the eight days. All which is done in
a little stone Vessel, bored through in the middle,
lest the sacred Oyls that besmear'd the Infants
Cloaths should be profan'd by powring away the
water that wash'd them upon the Ground.</P>
<P>This Oyl is highly esteem'd among the Eastern
Christians, especially among the <HI>Armenians,</HI> who
some while since, had a great dispute in Law upon
this very subject. Their Patriarch, who generally
resides in the upper <HI>Armenia,</HI> lives in a large con|vent,
which the <HI>Armenians</HI> in their Language call
<HI>Echemiazin,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> in regard of its three
Churches <HI>Vscha Klisia,</HI> and the <HI>Europeans,</HI> the <HI>Three
Churches.</HI> It is seated in a large Plain at the foot of
the famous Mountain <HI>Ararat.</HI> This <HI>Patriarch</HI> was
wont always to make the <HI>Myron</HI> (for so is the holy
Oyl call'd) and sent it from time to time to all the
<HI>Armenian</HI> Bishops, as well those in <HI>Persia</HI> and <HI>Turkie,</HI>
as to all the rest who had not permission to make
this Oyl, which was a priviledg only belonging to
the Patriarch. But it happen'd that about Ten
years since, the Bishop of <HI>Ierusalem</HI> having an Am|bition
to make himself Patriarch, for that <HI>Iacob
Vartabiet,</HI> the present <HI>Catholico&euml;s</HI> or Patriarch of
<HI>Armenia,</HI> had given over his trade, by an immediate
power from the Grand Signor, fell to work him|self,
and made such a quantity of the holy Oyl, as 'tis
thought would suffice all the <HI>Armenians</HI> in <HI>Turkie</HI>
for several years, which new <HI>Ierusalem Myron</HI> has
caus'd such a schism among the <HI>Armenians,</HI> that all
those who live in <HI>Turkie</HI> are now separated from
their ancient Brethren, and refuse the Bishop of
<HI>Ierusalem's Myron,</HI> who by the authority of the
Grand Signor had usurp'd the Patriarchship of
the <HI>Armenians,</HI> and maintains his ground notwith|standing
<PB N="161" REF="100">
all the suits in Law commenced against
him, and great sums of mony expended by the
former Patriarch, who thereupon came the last
year to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> to try whether he could bring
the <HI>Ierusalem</HI> Bishop to an accommodation, and to
take his <HI>Myron</HI> of him again as he did before.</P>
<P>This Oyl is boyl'd in a great Kettle with several
odoriferous herbs and drugs, and the wood that
feeds the fire is all sacred fuel, as the Relicks of
broken Images, torn books, and such other Church-moveables
as have been formerly consecrated to
pious uses. Nor will all this serve, unless it be
made and bless'd by the Patriarch himself, and three
or four Metropolitan Bishops, who in their ponti|fical
habits, and with their devoutest Prayers con|tinually
attend the Composition from the Vespers
of <HI>Palm-Sunday,</HI> till <HI>Holy-Thursday</HI> Mass, which is
celebrated upon the great Jar, where this precious
Oyl is put up for use.</P>
<P>And this is that holy Oyl employ'd in all
Unctions of Baptisme and Confirmation, which is
never twice apply'd to the same person. But there
is another Oyl which they call <HI>Eukoloon,</HI> or the
blessed Oyl of Prayer, which the <HI>Greeks</HI> frequently
make use of to anoint those who are in perfect
health, but the <HI>Latines</HI> never but only to the gasping.
The <HI>Greeks</HI> also give it at great feasts to those
who have confess'd and receiv'd the Communion,
but then they apply it only to the forehead and
hands, and the Priest when he performs the Cere|mony,
repeats the end of the seventh verse of the 122
<HI>Psalm, <GAP DESC="foreign">, The Net is
broken, and we are escap'd.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth sort of Unction in the <HI>Greek</HI> Church
is that which is given to the Priests,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Order</NOTE> whether <HI>Ca|loyers,</HI>
single men, or Marry'd; for the Sacrament
<PB N="162" REF="101">
of the <HI>Order</HI> is common to both. Therefore when
any person desires to be ordain'd a Priest, he is
first examin'd whether he can Write and Read;
for it is now adays a very great accomplishment
among the <HI>Greeks</HI> to have study'd so far, there
being several admitted to the Priesthood that can
do neither. Being thus examin'd by his <HI>Pneuma|ticos</HI>
or Confessor, who is many times as ignorant
as himself, he is presented to the Bishop; who, upon
the report of the spiritual Father, gives him his
Orders, yet so as the ceremonie is not compleated
in less than Three days one after another; nor till
the Bishop be satisfy'd of his life and conversation,
nor till he is proclaim'd in a full Congregation
<HI>axios,</HI> or <HI>worthy.</HI></P>
<P>The Sacrament of <HI>Penitence</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Peni|tence.</NOTE> among the <HI>Greeks</HI> at
this day consists only in rehearsing their sins to the
<HI>Pneumaticos,</HI> and undergoing the penance enjoyn'd.
However this recital is made without any serious
examination of the confession last made, nor accom|pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y'd
with any act of true sorrow or contrition
'Tis sufficient that they sit down in a Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r by the
Confessor, and in that commodious posture make
him a rehearsal of their faults themselves, or else
tarry to hear what questions their Confessor will
ask them, and then patiently receive his injunctions
of mild Penance; which amounts to such a number
of knee-bendings, or so many Almes, which is
more welcome. The next morning, or it may be
the same day, after the Priest has receiv'd himself,
he sings with a loud voice at the great door of the
Sanctuary, <GAP DESC="foreign">,
<HI>Approach in the fear of God, in Faith and Charity;</HI>
and then all the Communicants crowd to the said
door, at what time the Priest taking up the Cha|lice
in his left hand fill'd with Wine and sops of
<PB N="163" REF="101">
Bread, and a Spoon in his right hand, which they
call <HI>Labidi,</HI> he distributes a spoonful of Bread and
Wine to very one, not excepting the young Lads
of Thirteen or Fourteen years of age, at which
years the <HI>Greeks</HI> think 'em able to advise them|selves;
more especially seeing that it would be
unreasonable to deny the Communion to such, when
they administer it to sucking Infants.</P>
<P>The people throng in great numbers to this <HI>Me|talambasis</HI>
or Communion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eucha|rist.</NOTE> which they receive with|out
ever kneeling. And indeed there is no other
posture at Church in fashion, than that of standing
among the <HI>Greeks.</HI> And for this reason it is, that
instead of Seats and Pews, you see nothing in their
Churches but your <HI>Dekanikiai,</HI> which are a certain
sort of staves about four and five foot in length,
headed like Crutches, and upon these Crutches
they lean and rest themselves when they are weary
with standing up right. And in this posture they
also receive the Communion, under both kinds, of
Bread and Wine mix'd together in the same <HI>Poti|rion,</HI>
and with the same spoon, without any thing of
squeamishness or distast one of another, not be|lieving
that any one who approaches the Eucharist
can receive harm or infection of his Neighbour.
Yet the Priests are so civil, that if they see any one
with an apparent pair of scabbie chops, or that
has any other foul disease about him, they will
forbear to nauseat the stomachs of the rest, but order
them to stay and receive a-part; though if they
should be so clownish as to make no dictinction,
'twould be reckon'd no great crime.</P>
<P>In other respects there is that disorder in the ad|ministration
of the Sacrament, that the crowd of
people thronging in upon the Priest, cause him
many times to spill the sacred liquor upon their
<PB N="164" REF="102">
Cloaths; and often upon the ground. Which
proves a sad accident to the poor Priest; who
cannot perhaps help the unruliness of the Multi|tude.
For the Bishop being inform'd of this mis|chance,
presently suspends the unfortunate <HI>Papa</HI>
many times for five or six years. The Person thus
suspended is called <HI>Argos;</HI> as it were to teach the
Priest, that he who will undertake to hold such a
blessed Liquor in his hand ought to have <HI>Argus's</HI>
eyes in his head, and that if he miscarry in his duty,
he deserves no less than the punishment of that
same drousie Guardian.</P>
<P>As concerning Marriage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marri|age.</NOTE> the Ceremonies of per|formance
vary according to the custom of the
Country, though the essential part of the Sacrament
be the same. But the same Person cannot Marry
above three times; insomuch that a person that
has been Marry'd above three times is pointed
at as we point at Cut-purses or common Shop|lifters
in the street. Now when two young couple
are to be Marry'd, supposing they be pass'd the
Age of Thirteen years, their Parents agree together
and make up the Match without ever acquainting
the young couple, unless it be at <HI>Chios</HI> and some other
places in the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> where the young couple
are too yare for their Parents, and agreeing upon
the business between themselves, are Marry'd
several Months many times before their Parents
know any thing of the matter. And as these sort
of private alliances are very frequent, it is observa|ble
that they fall out much more to the content and
felicity of both parties, than those which are made
by the Parents without the consent of the Children.
But however it happen, the Wedding-day being
come, and the Contract being sign'd before the
<HI>Papa,</HI> the person to be Marry'd goes to the <HI>Cadi,</HI> to
<PB N="165" REF="102">
whom he gives a Crown for a <HI>Koget,</HI> or License to
Marry such a person, of whose name and habita|tion
he gives the <HI>Cadi</HI> a note; which done, either
in the Morning or Afternoon the Bridegroom and
the Bride go separately to the Church, where the
ceremony is performed much after the <HI>European</HI>
manner, only with this difference, that in the
Contract which is made before Marriage the
Husband cannot give to his affianc'd Mistress as a
present above Fifty Crowns in Silver, leaving him
at liberty however to augment the sum if he pleases
afterwards, though there is no obligation laid
upon him.</P>
<P>This Law was made to the end that Virgins might
not be hindred from Marrying to the first that
courted them, upon hopes that another would give
more; and for their Dowry they take the fourth
part of the houshold Goods which the Husband
leaves at his death, though perhaps she brought to
her Husband very little or nothing; it may be some
few Cloaths, Cushions, Coverlets, or Quilts, which
are very much us'd among the Eastern people.</P>
<P>The Ceremonies of the Contract, and of the
Church being over, the Bride and Bridegroom,
their Godfathers and Godmothers, their Parents
and Guests invited, return home to the Brides
house, and there begin their feasting and jollitie,
which according to the quality of the person con|tinues
till the eighth day after the Wedding; in
which time the Marry'd couple many times eat
themselves out of house and home, and pawn their
Goods to support the glory of the Ceremony. They
also observe two other Feasts during their lives, that
is to say, their own Birth-days, and those of the
death of their Parents. And in some parts of <HI>Turkie,</HI>
there is a laudable custom among the Christians to
<PB N="166" REF="103">
feast all their friends, when their Sons being arriv'd
at the age of Fourteen years begin to pay the <HI>Ca|rache</HI>
or Tribute which the <HI>Turks</HI> set upon the head
of every Christian; as if they rejoyc'd with the
Apostles that they were accompted worthy to suffer
ignominy for Christ's sake.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of their Festivals.</HEAD>
<P>We May also add to the number of the
<HI>Grecian</HI> days of Merriment, the Festivals
which they observe through the whole year, espe|cially
in the Islands, where the Christians enjoy far
more liberty than upon the <HI>Terra Firma.</HI> The
most remarkable of these Festivals are St. <HI>Andrew,</HI>
St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> the <HI>Forty Martyrs,</HI> and St. <HI>George.</HI>
The first of these Festivals is solemniz'd by the
<HI>Greeks</HI> upon the accompt that St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> being an
Elder Apostle than St. <HI>Peter,</HI> was the first that
Christ call'd to the Christian Faith. They also
believe him to be the Eldest Apostle, because he
first Preached the Gospel in <HI>Greece,</HI> where some
will have him to be the Founder of the Church at
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> and give him the Title of <HI>Proto-Pa|triarchis</HI>
or first Patriarch. But the manner of
keeping his Holy-day, is no way correspondent to
that honour which they pretend to bear him. 'Tis
true they go to Church in the morning, but all the
day after, they feast one another, and the Women
do not believe they have done St. <HI>Andrew</HI> right, if
they do not Fry for the whole Family a certain
sort of Fritters and Pancakes, which they call <HI>Ti|ganites,</HI>
fry'd in a pan with Oyl. The same chear
they have upon St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> day, only that they
throw into the <HI>Batter</HI> a <HI>Temin,</HI> which is a small piece
of mony worth five <HI>Sous,</HI> or else a <HI>Para</HI> which is
<PB N="167" REF="103">
another piece of money to the value of Eighteen
<HI>Deniers,</HI> of which one makes the tenth part of an
<HI>English</HI> Peny; and that person of the family who
finds that piece of money is esteemed very for|tunate;
a ceremony much like our chusing of <HI>King</HI>
and <HI>Queen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hagii Sarande's</HI> is another of their Holy-days,
which though it fall out in Lent, yet the <HI>Greeks</HI>
make no scruple to honour it with the best chear
they can make; especially in the Islands and out-Villages,
where they dance and frisk it like the Maids
about a <HI>May</HI>-Pole. I have often admir'd why
the <HI>Greeks</HI> are so jocund upon this Holy-day, consi|dering
the almost natural Antipathy between them
and the <HI>Armenians,</HI> in whose Country it was that
these happy Saints laid down their Lives for the
Faith of Christ, as being the Forty Saints that were
put to death at <HI>Sebastia</HI> in <HI>Armenia.</HI> Nor are they less
merry upon St. <HI>Georges</HI> day. So that the <HI>Greek</HI>
Holy-days are spent rather in Feasts and dancing
than in exercises of devotion. Nor do they repeat
upon those days their <HI>Pater Noster</HI> half so often,
as the following verses, which serve to regulate
the movement of their dances,
<Q><LG>
<L>Ascore Psomai Kai asinai</L>
<L>Ton Hagion Sarandon inai.</L>
</LG></Q>
<Q><LG>
<L>Let us dance and spend at leisure</L>
<L>Forty-Martyrs-day <HI>in pleasure.</HI></L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>Besides these more solemn Festivals, the <HI>Greeks</HI>
have also several Holy-days that will make a
Traveller laugh let him be ne're so serious. About
the middle of <HI>March</HI> I came to the Island of <HI>Mitylene,</HI>
which is the ancient <HI>Lesbos,</HI> where the great <HI>Pittacus</HI>
one of the seven wise men of <HI>Greece</HI> was born,
<PB N="168" REF="104">
and walking one day through the City, I saw the
Women at several Windows, some laying on with
good big sticks upon skillets, others upon copper
pans, or the covers of Kettles, others upon other
sorts of Kitchin furniture, and all to make a noise.
Wondering at the meaning of such a dismal noise, I
went into the house of a friend of my fellow Tra|vellers.
There I found the Children dancing in
the chamber to the barbarous melody their Mother
made upon her brass Kettle-Drum at the Window,
at the end of every Verse of a Ballad, which two of
the family sung well enough, considering they were
never taught at a Boarding-School, the whole Choir
came in with the burden of the Song, which was
to this effect.
<Q><LG>
<L>Oxo psili kai cori mesa</L>
<L>Martis kai chara.</L>
</LG></Q>
<Q><LG>
<L>March behind and give us ease,</L>
<L>Driving hence our Knats and fleas.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>For the Women believe that by vertue of this ce|remonie,
every year perform'd upon St. <HI>David's</HI> day,
the Fleas will never come near a house were they
hear such a horrid noise about their ears, at the
beginning of the Spring. But wofull experience
will teach a Traveller the vanity of this charming
superstitiou. For there are such a world of Knats
over all the East, that the best charm a man can
make use of is only a <HI>Psilo-diogma</HI> or a good
Fly-flap, to Murder as fast as he can those profest
enemies of his rest. 'Tis true the young <HI>Greeks,</HI>
who are loath to carry the marks of their stings
upon their tender skins, have found out another
sort of Persecution for their destruction. For
<PB N="169" REF="104">
every night before they lye down, they wash
their necks and arms with Vinegar, to secure at

<HEAD>The Religious Exercises of the Turks in

<P>AFter that <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Second had taken the

Entry into the Church of <HI>Sancta Sophia</HI> on Horse|back,
that same sacred Temple, which the

for the celebration of the Divine Mysteries of the

Articles of the <HI>Mahometan Faith.</HI> The second,
to be Circumcis'd. The third, to forgive his

<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of the Faith of the Turks.</HEAD>
<P>ALL the Articles of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Faith may
be reduc'd to two; namely, that there is
but one God, and <HI>Mahomet</HI> his peculiar Prophet or
Messenger. For the word <HI>Resul-alla</HI> signifies rather
a Messenger than a Prophet of God. The belief
of only one God happen'd by chance to the <HI>Turks;</HI>
if we may credit <HI>Iacoub Elkindi,</HI> an Author
whose Works are to be seen in <HI>Syriac,</HI> who
assures us, that the Alcoran being written, <HI>Sergius</HI>
sent <HI>Mahomet</HI> to some of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Idolaters,
who ador'd a huge Statue they call'd by the name
of <HI>Hachar,</HI> which signifies great or vast of bulk,
to tell them, that being commissionated of God, he
did by his command advertise them no longer to
adore any more Idols, but to acknowledge the only
true and one God which had sent him. But those
Idolatrous <HI>Arabians,</HI> devoted to the worship of
their <HI>Hachar,</HI> would give no heed to his message;
for, said they very gravely and considerately, if
we must adore one only God which is thine, what
shall become of our <HI>Hachar? Mahomet,</HI> not knowing
what answer to make to such a difficult and puzsling
objection, return'd back again, to consult with the
Monk <HI>Sergius.</HI> Who considering of what Impor|tance
it was to bring over those <HI>Arabians</HI> to the
Law which he was going about to establish, in
regard they were very numerous and neighbouring
upon <HI>Mount Sinia,</HI> where he had been a Monk,
sent back the new <HI>Legislator</HI> to acquaint 'em, that
he had consulted the Divinitie concerning their
<PB N="171" REF="105">
answer, and that he was satisfy'd they should have
the same esteem they had before for their old friend
<HI>Hachar,</HI> provided they would adore God too, in
testimony whereof, he was content that from
thence forward all the true Musselmen should be
call'd to their Prayers in the name of <HI>God</HI> and
<HI>Hachar.</HI> Upon this condition, that <HI>Hachar</HI> might
go Partners with God, the <HI>Arabians</HI> were content to
worship God, and follow the Law of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> and
from that time forward they made their joynt sup|plications
to <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Hachar;</HI> till <HI>Mahomet</HI> being
grown into greater power, order'd poor <HI>Hachars</HI>
Idol to be taken out of the Temples and to set up
in his room in great <HI>Arabian</HI> Characters, these
words, <HI>ALLA HOV HAC HER, God</HI> and
<HI>Hacher,</HI> which is the cry that the <HI>Mahometans</HI> have
ever since us'd to call the people to Prayers. And
this is the Relation of that ancient Author <HI>Iacoub
Ebni Issaac Elkindi,</HI> who liv'd about the year Eight
Hundred, about two Hundred years after <HI>Mahomet.</HI></P>
<P>Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ch if it be true, according to the report of
this same Author who was a Christian, the <HI>Cry</HI> of
the Muezins is easily expounded. Though it be
true on the other side, that the most skilful in the
<HI>Arabic</HI> Language, and most knowing in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI>
assure us, that we must not read the words <HI>Alla
hou ei Hacher, God</HI> and <HI>Hacher,</HI> but <HI>Alla
hou Hachar,</HI> without the Article <HI>el,</HI> which is then
no more than <HI>God is powerfull,</HI> and by maintaining
that the words were never otherwise written or
pronounc'd, avoid the reproach of being the Off|spring
of Idolatrous Ancestors, and of being con|strain'd
to change their first Religion for a new Doctrine.</P>
<P>The <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> therefore give divine adoration to
none but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">, the only Creator of Heaven and
<PB N="172" REF="106">
Earth, and absolute Lord of the World. And this
is the reason they will not suffer in their Mosquees
the Image or representation of any living thing
either in sculpture or painting; or if there be
any left remaining in Mosaic work, which the
ancient Christians made for the Ornaments
of their Churches, they are either in places so ob|scure
or so high where they are not taken notice of,
or if they are once discover'd 'tis because they are
unwilling to be at the charge of Scaffolds to pull
'em down or deface 'em. But where such prohi|bited
things are within their reach, they are either
disfigur'd and demolish'd, or quite daub'd over
with the Masons Trowel.</P>
<P>The second Article of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Faith com|prehends,
in epitome, all the vain dotages and ex|travagances
of the Alcoran, in believing <HI>Mahomet</HI>
to be the Messenger of God, and that there was
never any truth more certain than what that Im|postor
has convey'd to 'em, as well by Tradition as
Writing. Which Article, being the source and foun|tain
of all the rest, it will be needless to repeat here
their trifling Conceits concerning the creation and
preservation of the World, or the method which
God has taken to sanctifie and save mankind, with
many other fantastical and irrational opinions,
wherewith their brains and writings are stuff'd.
Nor shall I say any thing concerning their leud con|jectures
of Paradise, celestial in respect of the
Beatific Vision of God, of which they assure their
believers; but beastial in regard of those brutish
pleasures which they hope there to enjoy with a
full swinge, and the Apartments which they allow
therein to several Beasts, such as <HI>Abrahams</HI> Ram,
<HI>Moses's</HI> Heifer, <HI>Solomons</HI> Ant, the Queen of <HI>Sheba's</HI>
Parrot, <HI>Esdras's</HI> Ass, <HI>Ionas's</HI> Whale, the Seven
<PB N="173" REF="106">
sleepers Dog, and <HI>Mahomets</HI> Camel. Nor need I
speak of the number of their Prophets, of which
they have a vast scrowl, though none so famous as
<HI>Moses, Issa Peccamber</HI> or <HI>Christ,</HI> whose Filiation
and Death they deny, and <HI>Mahomet</HI> their chief; and
therefore passing over these Absurdities of their
belief, I come to</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>The Circumcision of the Turks.</HEAD>
<P>THe Law of <HI>Mahomet</HI> being the product of dull
earthly humane Invention, that had nothing
of sublimity or tendency toward immaterialty in
it, but such as thought it sufficient to bound it self
within the limits of voluptuous Sense, had need of
some remarkable character to distinguish it from
other Laws. The Christians, whom it concerns to
worship God in spirit and truth, and not with wrie
faces and antic Gestures, do not think it ne|cessary
to maim any part of the body which Nature
has made perfect; and therefore it was the opi|nion
of many Interpreters, that the proselyte
Gentiles were not oblig'd to the paring off so tender
a part as the <HI>Preputium,</HI> since that God not having
given any positive command for it, it was left at
liberty. But <HI>Mahomet</HI> who was obstructed by a
<HI>Phimosis</HI> in the satisfaction of his brutal Lusts, being
constrain'd to cut off his Foreskin, ordain'd that
all his adherents should be circumcis'd, whether it
were that he might the better be able to distinguish
the Body's of his Musselmen that should be slain in
fight, for the propagation of his Law, and to honour
them as Martyrs; or whether to ensnare the Jews,
and win them the more easily to embrace his er|rours
through the resemblance of Ceremonies; or
whether it were that that salacious Legislator
<PB N="174" REF="107">
affecting an outward cleaness to conceal the inward
filthiness of his soul, commanded those who had
already embrac'd his errours to mangle their <HI>Pre|putiums,</HI>
lest any defilement sticking to the part,
should render their persons less acceptable to
Heaven, is uncertain; though the middlemost rea|son
seems to be the most prevailing in point of
Policy, especially among those who look upon
<HI>Mahomet</HI> to have been a <HI>Machiavillian.</HI></P>
<P>This same act of <HI>Circumcision,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI>
call <HI>Shoonet,</HI> is only a mark of their obedience to
the verbal commands of <HI>Mahomet,</HI> there being no
such injunction in his <HI>Alcoran;</HI> only it was a
thing by him afterwards appointed, finding that
he had many followers, to distinguish his party
from the Christians who never Circumcis'd, and
the Jews who Circumcis'd after another fashion.
Now in regard it is a mark of disobedience to the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">r
Law to be uncircumcis'd, therefore they never
admit any to their publick Prayers that are not
distinguish'd so; that is to say, neither Christians,
nor Children of five or six years of age. However
I never heard of any Inspectors that ever stood
to search at the Entrance of the Temple; besides
that, I knew my self two Christian Travellers that
perfectly understood the <HI>Arabic</HI> and <HI>Turkish</HI> Lan|guages,
who pass'd for as good Musselmen as any
were in <HI>Turkie,</HI> and were well receiv'd where ever
they went, as being in the habit of <HI>Derviches,</HI> and
because they knew how to mumble over the <HI>Turkish</HI>
Prayers in the Mosquees, when they could not
avoid going thither. But had it been known that
those persons were not Circumciz'd, they had not
only been refus'd admittance, but burnt alive, or
else empal'd upon a stake.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="107">
Now they never Circumcise any till they come
to six or seven years of age: Elder than these are
often Circumciz'd, but never younger, sometimes
at twelve, fifteen years or more, according to the
pleasure of the Parents: Especially if they be poor
people, for then not being able to defray the charges
of a private, they must stay till the Rich make a
publick Circumcision of their own. The day for
the Ceremony being appointed, the Master of the
house prepares a great Feast, and makes his Son as
fine as his quality will reach; then the boy being
mounted upon a Horse or Camel, is led in triumph
through the Village, or only that quarter of the
City where his Parents live, if it be large. His
School-fellows and friends wait upon him on foot,
hollowing and hooping for joy that he is going to
be admitted into the number of true <HI>Musselmen.</HI>
The <HI>Cavalcade</HI> being thus finish'd, and the guests re|turn'd
back to the house, the <HI>Iman</HI> makes a pithie
Harangue upon the operation that is to ensue; at
the end of which comes a Chirurgion, who having
plac'd the lad upon a <HI>Sopha</HI> or <HI>Turkish</HI> Table, two
Servants holding a linnen napkin before him, draws
out the Preputium in length as far as he can pull it,
and so keeping it from running back, by clapping
a pair of little Pincers at the head of the nut, takes
off the surplusage with a sharp Razor, and then
holds it up in his fingers to be seen by all the
Company, who cry out at the same time, <HI>Alla Hecher
ia Alla Alla.</HI> Which done he dresses the Wound,
not a little to the torment of the party Circumciz'd,
who by his roaring convinces the standers-by what
pain he endures by the wounding so sensible and
tender part of his body. But his friends are so far
from compassionating his lamentations, that they
presently come all to congratulate his admission
<PB N="176" REF="108">
into the number of the Faithful, and then take their
places at the <HI>Sopha,</HI> or <HI>Turkish</HI> Table, where they
are entertain'd according to the quality of the
Parents.</P>
<P>And often the liberality of Rich men at their
Child's Circumcision amounts to large sums. For
besides the Almes which they give to a great num|ber
of poor Children which are Circumciz'd, fre|quently
at their charges, at the same time, they
also distribute considerable Almes to the poor of
the Neighbourhood, to the end they may obtain the
blessing of God upon the new Circumciz'd Lad,
and all the rest of their Family.</P>
<P>The Ceremony of Circumcising <HI>Renegado's</HI> is
almost the same. Only if they be very poor, they
have Basons carry'd after 'em to Collect the Almes
of the Spectators, who never refuse to give more or
less. They also as others do, carry an Arrow upright
in their left hands, with the point downwards, to
let the people understand that they will rather be
stuck with a Thousand Arrows than renounce the
<HI>Mahometan</HI> Faith. However experience tells them,
that there are many who having slightly quitted
their Religion, because perhaps they never had
any, with the same inconstancy abandon what they
so solemnly and with so much pain have embrac'd
at their expences; which is the reason that the
<HI>Turks</HI> have a kind of Proverb, <HI>Er kim fena Giaur ol|michidi
eche ei Musulman olur. He that has been an ill
Christian will never make an honest Turk.</HI> In short, it
may be said that all the mischief which is done
in <HI>Turkie</HI> is done by the Renegado's, and not by the
<HI>Turks,</HI> who are naturally civil and tractable enough,
especially where they meet with persons conforma|ble
to their fashions, and that carefully avoid
giving scandal or offence. And indeed it may be
<PB N="177" REF="108">
said that the number of Renegado's is greater than
that of the <HI>Turks;</HI> for that the most part of the
Basha's and their Retinue are Deserters of the
Christian Faith or Judaisme.</P>
<P>Now there are three sorts of <HI>Renegado's.</HI> The
first are those whose misfortune it is to be of the
number of the Tribute-Children, which the
<HI>Grand Signor</HI> exacts over all his Empire. The
second are those who voluntarily change their Re|ligion,
out of hopes to raise their Fortunes; and
the last, such as are forc'd thereto, out of
fear of such punishments which perhaps they
have justly deserv'd, or through the ill usage of a
Tyrannical Patron, who make the smallest number;
for the Slaves in <HI>Turkie</HI> are not so ill us'd, as people
imagine; being as it were many times Vice-Masters
of the Family; and I have known my self some
so well us'd by their <HI>Aga's,</HI> that after they
have had their liberty given them, and coming
home into <HI>Europe,</HI> and not finding there what they
expected, have return'd back of their own accord
to a more pleasing Servitude. It may be said, that
those Slaves are happy in the midst of their Mis|fortune,
who being Masters of some piece of Inge|nuity
meet with a king <HI>Aga</HI> in a great City. For
such are cherish'd by their Masters, who will
never deny them going to Church, and to practice
their own Religion: Many times also they get the
good will of their Mistresses, who out of that com|passion
which is natural to their Sex, do very much
asswage the Rigours of their Captivity, by obli|ging
them with Presents and Gratuities from time
to time.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Turkish</HI> Circumcision: I
forgot to observe, that as there is no set place
for this bloody Ceremony, so is there no time
<PB N="178" REF="109">
prefix'd, neither is a man ty'd to the choise of his
Operator. It may be done in the Bath, or at
home, by the <HI>Iman,</HI> or by the Chirurgeon; for
being only a mark of Mahometanisme, it admits of
all sorts of persons to do the work, as also of all
places and Ages. Nor do they defer naming the
Child till the time of the Ceremony; and though
they have Godfathers provided, yet is it not their
business to name the Child, which is done by the
Parent, as soon as it is born; at what time the
Father taking the Infant in his Arms, lifts it up
toward Heaven, as it were an Offering to God, and
then putting some few Corns of Salt in the mouth
of it, names the Child in uttering these words,
<HI>May it please God (Ibrahim,</HI> or what he pleases) <HI>that
his holy name may be as savoury to thee, as these Corns
of Salt which I now put into thy mouth; and that he
may preserve thee from tasting with delight the things
of this world.</HI> As for them that dy before Circum|cision,
they beleive them to be sav'd by that of their
Parents. Only they break one of their little
fingers, before they bury them, to mark them for
uncircumcis'd.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of Pardoning Enemies.</HEAD>
<P>THe Pardoning and forgiveness of our enemies
is a thing not only of advantage to the Tran|quility
of Mankind, but is also enjoyn'd by the
sacred Command of the Saviour of our Souls. So
that it is no wonder if the <HI>Turkish</HI> Laws, which are
only a corrupted Collection of what is partly good,
partly bad, partly indifferent, among Christians,
Jews and Idolaters, have commanded the Musselmen
to pardon also their particular enemies: For they
are oblig'd to be otherwise affected toward the
<PB N="179" REF="109">
Enemies of their Religion and Country. So that
there are very seldome any Grudges between <HI>Turk</HI>
and <HI>Turk;</HI> or if there happen any quarrel among
them, it behoves them not to let <HI>Friday</HI> (which is
their Sunday) Sun to set before they are perfectly
reconcil'd, or if they cannot do that, they are
oblig'd the same morning to begin their devotions
with that Prayer wherein they make a protestation
to God to pardon their Enemies, or else they
believe that all the rest of their Prayers will be in
vain.</P>
<P>Upon these Grounds, and for these reasons, the
Mahometans are severely commanded to do no
injury to their Neighbour, either in word or deed:
Reproachful Language as well as hard blows are
equally forbidden. The wronging his Neighbour
in his Goods or Estate, by himself or at the in|stigation
of another, lyes under the same restraint of
punishment and forfeiture. The drubbing-stick
(which the <HI>Turks</HI> believe to have descended from
Heaven, because it imprints a deeper awe in their
minds, and keeps them within the bounds of their
duty beyond all the most sacred Laws they can
make) is the only pen with which they ingross
their Sentences against criminal Offenders. 'Tis
enough for the <HI>Sou-Bachi</HI> to walk now and then
through the streets, to put the people in remem|brance,
what they must expect from the least
grumbling or murmer that shall be heard among
them; no less than a shower of Bastinadoes, not
only upon the Authors, but the spectators of the
Infant-Tumult; without any regard to their roa|ring,
and reiterated cryes of <HI>Toba Sult<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">num,</HI> which
is the lamentable ejaculation of the party under
Correction.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="110">
The dread of this punishment keeps every one
upon his Guard. They whose fingers itch to be
striking, dare not discharge their choler, for fear
of being constrain'd to empty their Purses of some
Millions of Aspers, upon complaint made to the
<HI>Divan;</HI> much less dare they presume to strike, for
fear of undergoing a more painful sort of basting.
Besides that they who are sensible of anothers
malice, and perceive a quarrel in the wind, being
oblig'd under the same Penalties to part the fray
with all the speed that may be, never stir from
the place till all be quiet. And many times they
make the two passionate Antagonists friends upon
the place, and oblige 'em to renew a friendship
which perhaps had never been, had they suffer'd
their fury to have taken its full swinge.</P>
<P>If the persons that are scolding or fighting will
not give over, notwithstanding all means us'd, and
the repetition of a wholesome and pertinent sen|tence
out of he Alcoran, they draw 'em away by
main force, crying out <HI>Charae ulla,</HI> by the Law of
God, and carry 'em before the <HI>Cadi,</HI> who fails not
to condemn them to the punishment of their obsti|nacy.
And so the Sentence being pass'd, they lay
the Criminal upon his back, and after they have
giv'n him at least Two Hundred drubs upon the
soles of his feet which are ty'd to a <HI>Falaque,</HI> they
force him to pay Two or Three Thousand <HI>Aspers</HI>
besides for his contempt.</P>
<P>The Rigour of these Laws does not only restrain
the <HI>Turks</HI> from doing injury one to another, but it
has the same effect upon those that swear and pro|fane
the holy name of God, which in other places
(where the Laws pretend to a more divine Origi|nal)
goes unpunish'd. Which is the reason that
the greatest Oath which you shall hear among the
<PB N="181" REF="110">
<HI>Turks,</HI> when they would seriously affirm a truth, is
<HI>valla hebilla, by the God whom I adore.</HI> Nay you shall
find that the <HI>Tnrks</HI> who live at a great distance from
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> and are consequently more frequently
in the Christians Company, make use of the
Christian and <HI>Greek</HI> Oaths, not having any so
proper in their own Language, which yet they
make use of rather by way of flattery and caress.
However we must confess they do not always ob|serve
this moderation, especially among the vulgar
sort, or when they discourse with people of a
different Religion; for then instead of those in|dearing
appellations of <HI>janum, iki gusum, cardache,
my heart, my two eyes, my Brother,</HI> and the like, they
will give ye the outragious Complements of <HI>Giaur,
Kupec, dinsis, or Infidel, Dog, and faithless.</HI> But
such as are better Educated than the common sort
are much more civil and courteous, and as little as
they care for strangers, they are as kind and obli|ging
to such, as if they were natives of their own
Religion, especially if they can discourse with them
in the <HI>Turkish</HI> Language.</P>
<P>I was one day at <HI>Boursa</HI> with Monsieur <HI>Vaillant,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Bellocier de</HI> S. <HI>Sauveur,</HI> and two other <HI>French</HI>
Travellers, where passing by a certain place, a slave
belonging to a <HI>Turkie</HI> Merchant having spy'd us,
and perceiving us to be strangers, and more than
that <HI>French</HI>-men as well as himself, very civilly ac|costed
us, and invited us to his Masters House. He
told us, that his Master having a great affection for
him, was glad to see any person at his house, that he
affirm'd to be his Country-man; for proof of which
he would treat us after the <HI>Turkish</HI> mode, to shew
us that a slave in <HI>Turkie,</HI> who knows how to gain
his Patrons affection, is not always the most
miserable person in the world. To this purpose,
<PB N="182" REF="111">
he gave his Master notice of our coming, giving
him withall to understand that we were his own
Country-men, and therefore besought him that he
might have the credit of entertaining us. The
Merchant consented, bid him invite us the next
day, and provide what he thought fit. In short, the
slave omitted nothing which he could procure to
be dress'd after the <HI>French</HI> fashion, and the Master
spar'd not for his <HI>Turkish</HI> Ragou's so that we had
an entertainment which sufficiently testify'd our
welcome, and that there are persons in all places
and of all Religions, in the most barbarous of
Nations, that out of their innate honesty and
goodness can distinguish between rudeness and
civility.</P>
<P>Nor can I pass by the kind entertainment which
this honest Merchant gave us, without giving him
this due commendation; that besides the moral
virtues which he practis'd, he wholly resign'd him|self
up to the will of God: Which is more usual
with the <HI>Turks</HI> than with any other Nation, in
regard of their opinion touching predestination.
Of which to give us some proof, he gave us a short
story of his life. Wherein after he had given us
a brief accompt of some misfortunes that had be|fall'n
him upon the accompt of Trade, and the
breaking of some of his Debtors, sickness and
death of his Cattel and Servants, and the like, per|ceiving
that we compassionated his Misfortunes, he
concluded with this expression, <HI>Alla kerim,</HI> said he,
<HI>beulai alla ister beulai olsun. God is all powerful;
and it was his will it should be so.</HI></P>
<P>Nor was this the only civil person that I have
met withall among the Mahometans. I have been
often in their Caravans, presented with Coffee,
Fruits and Sherbet, Among other times Travelling
<PB N="183" REF="111">
in the Caravan between <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Dierbeker,</HI> the
capital City of <HI>Mesopotamia,</HI> in regard I was the
only <HI>European</HI> among them, I was oblig'd to
strike into Company with five or six <HI>Turkish</HI> Mer|chants,
persons of a good jolly humour, in regard
they had a Tent to pitch at resting times, which I
being alone had not the convenience to carry. Now
in regard the Passengers are oblig'd to keep senti|nell
every night by turns, for fear of being sur|priz'd
by the <HI>Arabian</HI> Robbers, or <HI>Karakersi's,</HI>
when it came to our turn we made use of the Moon
to light us to our divertisements, playing at <HI>Quoits</HI>
all our time round about the <HI>Caravan.</HI> The next
company that reliev'd us, finding that we were
then enow to make up a Company for a dance or
two, undertook to sing us a Song, which put us
all into motion. In this manner the frolick went
round; every one sung his Song, some in <HI>Turkish,</HI>
some in <HI>Arabic,</HI> which when they had all done,
they desir'd me to sing one in <HI>French;</HI> which when
I had concluded they all fell a laughing one at
another, because they could not repeat my Song as
I had theirs, and so were forc'd to give over the
Dance, and to listen to another that play'd upon
his <HI>Taboura,</HI> and sang a new Aire, which pleas'd 'em
much better than my seeming Gibbrish. And thus
we continu'd all the Journey, harmlessly, loving|ly,

They believe that the Christians and Jews not
having obey'd the precept of God, who enjoyn'd
<PB N="184" REF="112">
them the duty of frequent Prayer; he commanded
<HI>Mahomet</HI> to prescribe to the Musselmen a task of
no less than Fifty Prayers and Vows a day. But
<HI>Mahomet</HI> foreseeing that the task would prove
too hard, so far prevail'd with God Almighty, as
to be contented with a tenth part of the homage;
in so much that the frightful number of <HI>Fifty</HI> was
reduc'd to <HI>Five.</HI> Now in regard that Bells and
Clocks were forbidden, there was a necessity to
appoint certain persons, who by the strength of
their Voices should give the people notice of the
Prayer time. These <HI>Proclaimers</HI> are call'd <HI>Muezins</HI>
from two <HI>Arabic</HI> words <HI>Muaz</HI> and <HI>zin</HI> or a <HI>sound in
the ear.</HI> These <HI>Muezins</HI> therefore are bound to
get up to the tops of the Towers of the Mosquees
five times a day every day, and there stopping
their eares, to Proclaim as loud as they can tare
their Throats <HI>Alla</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This word is mistaken in the foregoing Pages and Printed Hecher.</NOTE> Hecber. This they do at break
of day, at Noon, at Three in the Afternoon, at Sun-Set,
and One of the Clock at night. Of these set|times
for Prayer, the first is call'd <HI>Salem,</HI> or <HI>Sabah
namasi;</HI> the second <HI>Euylai namasi;</HI> the third <HI>Kindi
namasi,</HI> the fourth <HI>Accham namaci;</HI> and the last <HI>Ya|tisi
namasi,</HI> or <HI>Bedtime|Prayer.</HI> The <HI>Turks</HI> seldom fail
at all these times, but never at the first and two
last. For should they miss these three of only
five that are enjoyn'd them, it would cost them a
severe and exemplarie punishment. Nor is there
any excuse to be made, for if they are not in a con|dition
to go to the Mosquee, they are bound to pray
in the place where they are; nay even to light
from their Horses, if they chance to be Travelling
upon the Road at that time. If they are in a <HI>Ca|ravan</HI>
the Master is bound to make a stand, and to
give notice himself of the time as soon as it comes,
turning his <HI>Caravan</HI> to the point of <HI>Kobl&egrave;</HI> or toward
<HI>Mecca.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="112">
Besides these five prefix'd times of Prayer, of
which the <HI>Muezins</HI> give notice upon the Steeple tops,
there are also two others, <HI>Friday</HI> or <HI>Sunday</HI> Prayers,
and Ramazan or Lent Prayers. The first of these
appointments is call'd <HI>Salah,</HI> at Nine of the Clock
in the Morning every <HI>Friday,</HI> or <HI>giuma guni;</HI> the
second is call'd <HI>Taravi&eacute; Namasi</HI> beginning at
Midnight all the time of Ramazan Month, and
upon the full of the Moon of the two Months pre|ceding,
that is to say, upon the Fifteenth of <HI>Regeb,</HI>
and the Fifteenth of <HI>Chaban:</HI> However the Prayers
which are said all these times, never last above
half an hour, and sometimes they chop'em up in
less than a quarter. So soon as <HI>Friday's Salah</HI> is
done, the Tradesmen and Shopkeepers may all
attend their employments and go to work if they
please; for all Prayer and no work would turn but
to very little profit.</P>
<P>The words which the Muezins baul out at <HI>Con|stantinople</HI>
are not many; no more than <HI>Alla Hecber,</HI>
but they repeat these words several times and at
several quarters of the Galleries which surround the
Towers, concluding at last with these words, <HI>Ahia
Elsela, Ahiah Elsela,</HI> as much as to say, <HI>Come away to
Prayers, I have given ye notice sufficient.</HI> Upon great
Festivals and during Bairam, you shall have a whole
consort of these Cryers all in one Gallery baulling
their <HI>Alla Hecbers</HI> in different tones, like so many
Cats upon the Tiles; which to the <HI>Turks,</HI> that
know no better, sounds more pleasantly than the
<HI>Scotch</HI> Bagg-pipes to a Foot Company. While I
was at <HI>Constantinople</HI> one day in <HI>Bairam,</HI> at what
time a whole Kennel of these Muezins were yelling
at the top of a large Tower, a young Christian
<HI>Greek</HI> Lad passing by the Mosquee, and not liking
their Musick, began to mock them with an imita|tion
<PB N="186" REF="113">
of his own; which the Mahometans that
were going to the Mosquee over-hearing, they
laid hold of the Child, and endeavour'd to per|swade
him to turn <HI>Turk;</HI> using at first fair words
and large promises, which not prevailing, they
put the poor Child in Prison; and yet all their
torment could not move the resolute Lad, who out
of a generosity truly celestial, chose rather to
suffer the Bastinado, and the loss of his life, which
the merciless <HI>Turks</HI> took from him by cutting off his
head, than to renounce the Christian Faith, only
breathing out with his last Breath these words,
which the <HI>Greeks</HI> frequently make use of in their
Prayers, <HI>Christ have mercy upon us.</HI> A rare example
of cruel superstition in the <HI>Turks</HI> and of <HI>Christian</HI>
constancy in the Child.</P>
<P>Now though it is impossible their Cryers should
make such a noise with their throats as the Bells
with their Clappers, yet in regard there are no
Coaches at <HI>Constaninople,</HI> and few of those Trades
that deafen the eares, their Voices being clear and
strong may be heard a great way, even to the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t
remote Quarters of the City, and into the Fields
adjoyning, where I have heard them my self at a
good considerable distance. Besides there is such a
vast number of these <HI>Muezins</HI> that they never want
a full cry to make a noise, it being lookt upon as an
act that merits pardon of their sins, to proclaim
the Hour of Prayer to the Good Musselmen.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Purification of the Turks.</HEAD>
<P>THe last preparation of the <HI>Turks</HI> for Prayer
is that of washing. Which Ablutions are of
five sorts, and call'd by five several names. The
first, which is the most general, as being made use
<PB N="187" REF="113">
of as well by the Christians as <HI>Turks,</HI> is in the
ordinary Bath, which they call <HI>Amam.</HI> The second is
what necessity requires, and is call'd <HI>Taharet;</HI> which
signifies <HI>cleaness.</HI> The third is to cleanse themselves
from any defilement which they may have fallen
into by day or night, which they call <HI>Gousla,</HI> or
<HI>Purification.</HI> The fourth is to wash away all the
contaminations contracted in the day time through
the Organs of the five senses. For which they are
forc'd to borrow a name from the <HI>Persians,</HI> who
call it <HI>Abdest,</HI> which signifies <HI>ablution.</HI> And the
last is the Bath provided for dead Body's which
they call <HI>Eulu-i akmakh,</HI> or the <HI>washing</HI> of the
<HI>Dead.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of their Baths.</HEAD>
<P>Over all the world there is no Nation that
affects cleanliness so much as the <HI>Mahome|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ns,</HI>
as well <HI>Persians</HI> as <HI>Ottomans.</HI> So that I may
say the essential part of their Religion consists in
these outward Ceremonies. For which reason
they have been forc'd to Build a great number of
Bathing houses, that they may have the liberty to
wash their body's all over. Hence it comes to
pass, that there are a great number of these houses
all over <HI>Turkie,</HI> and some not inferiour to the anci|ent
<HI>Thermae</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperours. You need
no more than take a view of those in the City of
<HI>Boursa,</HI> which are all of hot water, contain'd in a
large receptacle, encompass'd with seats. They
are cover'd with two very fair <HI>Domo's,</HI> under
which are two large Chambers, where the Air and
the Water afford a different heat: With another
large Room somewhat cooler; where you undress
before you go into the Bath. So that every one
<PB N="188" REF="114">
of these Buildings require at least three large
Rooms. The first where you enter and undress,
where the Air is Temperate, yet not so cool as in
the street. The second warmer than the first; and
the third so hot, that it sets you presently in a
sweat.</P>
<P>All sorts of persons are admitted into these
Baths, as well Christians and Jews as <HI>Turks,</HI> in regard
they are Built for the publick good and for the com|mon
health of all people. I am perswaded that these
Baths are in good part the Cause that the <HI>Ottomans</HI>
are not so subject to Diseases as the <HI>Europeans,</HI> and
that they would be more healthy than they are,
but that they frequent them too much. For these
Baths, as all sorts of Physick, are only to be made
use of in case of necessity, otherwise they become
more prejudicial than advantageous to the health.
I was acquainted in <HI>Persia</HI> with a Capuchin Fryer,
who notwithstanding that he was above Fourscore
years of Age, was nevertheless very vigorous and
healthy, because he never was wont to drink Wine,
but when he found himself not very well. For
when he perceiv'd himself indispos'd, all the Physic
he took was only a large glass of generous Wine,
which restor'd him to his former temperament.
The same may be said of the Eastern Baths, there
could be nothing more wholesome, were they mo|derately
made use of, that is to say, not above once
a month; but in regard the <HI>Turks</HI> Bath themselves
almost every day, their brains are thereby so over
moisten'd, that they are generally troubled with a
continual Rheume in their eyes. But such is their
superstition, that they choose rather to prejudice
their health, than to give any Example of disobe|dience
to their Law.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="114">
It would require a good revenue, to use the
Baths so frequently as they do, were it as dear
Bathing in <HI>Turkie</HI> as in <HI>France,</HI> and they would
have as much reason to complain as <HI>Martial</HI> of the
exaction of the Age;
<Q><L>Balnea post decimam lasso centumque petuntur</L>
<L>Quadrantes.&mdash;</L></Q>
<Q><L>Then weary to the Baths he hasts, and payes</L>
<L>A hundred Quadrants for his future ease.</L></Q>
But in regard there is set no price, only every man
gives, as at a Barbers shop, what he thinks fitting
himself, the pleasure becomes cheap without ex|action,
and he's a good customer of a <HI>Turk</HI> that
gives the value of Two <HI>Sous</HI> a time; for the Franks
and <HI>Europeans</HI> are more generous. All sorts and
Sexes pay, Masters, Mistresses, and slaves; only
little Children till they come to be seven years of
age are exempted. The time appointed for the
Men, is from break of day till Noon. After which
time there is no occasion for that admonition of
<HI>Hesiod,</HI>
<Q><L>Neque in muliebri balneo corpus abluito vir.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Nor is't for Men in those same Baths wherein</L>
<L>The Women Bath, to wash their courser skin.</L></Q></P>
<P>For the Women are allowed to take their turns,
though more out of wantonness than necessity; it
being the chief place where the Gossips meet and
spend the Afternoon in tatling and junketting,
according to that of <HI>Ovid,</HI>
<Q><L>Condunt furtivos balnea multa jocos.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Full many a want on prank the Baths conceal.</L></Q>
<PB N="190" REF="115">
All the while, the Women are every one attended
with an old she slave, that looks to her Mistresse's
Cloaths in the outward Room. As it was the
custome in <HI>Martials</HI> time,
<Q><L>Supra togalam lusca sederet anus.</L></Q>
<Q><L>When Blear-ey'd Female slave quite out of date,</L>
<L>Over her Mistress Mantle brooding fate.</L></Q></P>
<P>While these are upon the Guard, their Mistresses
are busied in the Bath with their Companions in co|louring
their Locks, the nails of their toes and fin|gers,
with the powder of an herb which the <HI>Arabians</HI>
call <HI>Elbanna,</HI> the <HI>Turks Alkana,</HI> which makes them
look red, and gumming and dying the hair of
their eylids, to render themselves the more ami|able
to their Spouses, at their return home, which
is about Eight of the Clock at night, at what time
the <HI>Bagno</HI> is shut up till Four the next morning.
Nor is this a custome of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Women only,
it being also observ'd of old by the <HI>Roman</HI> Ladies,
according to that of <HI>Iuvenal.</HI>
<Q><LG>
<L>Illa supercilium madida fuligine tactum</L>

<L>Then on her brows the fucus rudely lay'd,</L>
<L>With needles point is far more neatly spread:</L>
<L>Which makes her trembling eylids still to fear</L>
<L>The frequent touches of each single hair.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>But as to the washing and scrubbing of men, the
<HI>Turks</HI> have a particular dexerity. For after the
man has undress'd himself in the first Hall, he tyes
about him a large Napkin, which they call <HI>Fota</HI> or
<HI>Pestemal;</HI> and in that equipage he passes through the
second Room into the third, where he is to sweat.
To which purpose he layes himself flat upon his
belly in the middle of the Room, upon a place pav'd
<PB N="191" REF="115">
with Marble, and somewhat rais'd, which is the
hottest part of all the Bath; where after he has
sufficiently sweat, he comes to one of the Atten|dants
in the stove, who takes him by his Arms, and
having pull'd and stretch'd them out with all his
force, and turn'd them backward and forward, and
then also observ'd the same method of stretching
and pulling the leggs, with his hands and his feet,
smooths over his backs and thighs with a wonder|ful
agility; which done he presently carry's the
party thus prepar'd to another part of the Room,
where are several Cocks of hot water; there he
washes him all over, and rubs him with a Camlet,
Grogram, or some such kind of course rubber, after
which the <HI>Tender</HI> sopes him and rubs him again.</P>
<P>These Grogram rubbers are come in place of the<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See the form of them in</HI> Petro|nius Arbiter.</NOTE>
ancient <HI>Strigiles</HI> or <HI>Scrapers:</HI> Not so much for the
form or matter, for these rubbers are square, and
serve only to cleanse away the filth that lyes in the
skin, but the <HI>Strigiles</HI> were to scrape the skin: And
certainly the former are much more commodious,
and manageable, than those Instruments of Metal
which had a handle and were made almost like a
pruning hook. The <HI>Turks</HI> have the same liberty
as to their <HI>Rubbers,</HI> which the <HI>Romans</HI> had in refe|rence
to their <HI>scrapers:</HI> For that every one may
have his rubber to himself, and carry it with him
to the Bath for his own particular use, and thus
<HI>Crispin</HI> in <HI>Perseus</HI> sends for his own <HI>Scrapers;</HI>
<Q><L>I, puer, &amp; strigiles Crispini ad balnea defer.</L></Q>
<Q><L>Go Boy, fetch <HI>Crispins</HI> scrapers to the Bath.</L></Q></P>
<P>But in regard the <HI>Turks</HI> are nothing nice in
eating or drinking after one another in the same
dish or cup, they are as little scrupulous in suffering
<PB N="192" REF="116">
themselves to be rubb'd with another man's or
a common rubber, though the person were never so
nasty, provided they see themselves that he was
well washed.</P>
<P>The frequent injunctions which the Law of
<HI>Mahomet</HI> has impos'd upon his followers to Bath
often, has occasion'd several persons to erect Baths
in their own houses, where they may be tended by
their own slaves, or wash themselves without being
oblig'd to go to the public stoves; and these Buil|dings
serve for a good excuse to the men, to deny
their Wives the liberty of gadding abroad under
pretence of going to the Baths. They are so well
contriv'd, that without going into the Kitching,
or being troubl'd with the steams of the pot, one
fire serves at once both to heat the <HI>Amamgick</HI> or
stove, and dress dinner. Now in regard these sort
of Buildings are of great use in houses of any value,
especially in the Country, I do shortly intend to
publish to the world a Draught of the outside and
inside of one of them, to the end they that are so
minded, may understand how to erect one in
their own houses for the use of themselves and their
friends.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of the Tahara or cleanliness of
the Turks.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Mahometans</HI> affect cleanliness after such an
extraordirary manner, that fearing to be defil'd
by any sort of excrement which Nature expells, they
are not content to wash the universal Emunctory of
the skin, but also to cleanse all the issues of Nature,
and that as often as they discharge the last con|coction
of their nourishment. So that the Bason&punc;
<PB N="193" REF="116">
or <HI>Embrik</HI> is never out of their hands to clean all
parts of their Body from whence any excrement
proceeds, which makes it a very pleasant sight to
see the postures of a <HI>Turk</HI> that is troubled with a
looseness, or such a one as cannot hold his water, he
needs no other business to do; he has employment
enough for his hands, and can never complain
that he knows not how to spend his time. They
know not the meaning of a Spunge-Carrier, and it
would be a crime unpardonable to make use of
Paper; lest being written it should have any
Letters in it that might compose the name of God:
or being clean, might be fit to have the name of
God written upon it. And for this reason it is, that
Paper is in such high esteem among the <HI>Maho|metans.</HI>
They never make use of it for trifling oc|casions,
nor can they endure to see it trod upon.
If they find any bit of Paper in the street, they take
it up, kiss it, fold it up decently, and very devoutly
put it in some hole in the wall. This high value
for paper certainly proceeds from the great vene|ration
they have for the Alcoran, which they
never carry below their Girdles; or else from
their great love of Learned men, which are very
much esteem'd among them.</P>
<P>This same cleanliness, so religiously observ'd,
has employ'd the Mahometan Architecture in all
Quarters of the City, especially near the Mosquees,
to build a great number of necessary houses, which
in their Language they call <HI>Adepkana,</HI> or the <HI>house
of shame,</HI> whence that reproach so usual among
them, that when they would denote a person
without shame, they call him <HI>Adepsis.</HI> These public
Conveniencies are very beneficial; for besides the
great care which they take to keep them neat and
sweet, which is the business of the <HI>Maidagi,</HI> or
<PB N="194" REF="117">
public Scavenger, who cleanses them every
<HI>Thursday</HI> in the week, there is a Fountain always
running in every one of the Partitions, or else a
Cock to turn, and ready to supply every one's necessity.</P>
<P>I must confess, we have nothing so commodious,
nor any thing of this conveniency in any part of
<HI>Europe;</HI> and yet at the same time nothing so
necessary, especially in great Cities, were it but
only for decency, which is a principal Ornament.
You shall never see in Travelling over all the East,
what is dayly observ'd and suffer'd in our Cities,
the Walls of our Churches stain'd with Urine, and
bedeck'd at the bottom with the excrements of
those who it behov'd to have approach'd those
places with more respect. Nor is any body there
oblig'd to prejudice his health, by retaining his
natural evacuations for want of a conveniency.</P>
<P>I never heard so many invectives against the Go|vernment
of the Europeans upon this accompt, as
was utter'd by a <HI>Turk</HI> at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> who had
travail'd to <HI>Marseilles,</HI> and thence to <HI>Paris.</HI> He was
wont accor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ing to the custome of his Country to eat
great plenty of Fruits, Salads, and among the rest
of Cucumbers half ripe, together with their stalks,
a dyet very proper to break a <HI>French</HI> horses belly,
yet very much us'd among the Eastern people,
whose digestion tames it well enough. This <HI>Turk</HI>
lodg'd, as he told me, in the quarter of St. <HI>Eustachius,</HI>
during the heat of the Summer, which he found
more fierce than in his own Country (<HI>Damasco</HI> in
<HI>Syria,</HI> though it lye fifteen degrees more to the
South) and therefore to cool himself, he resolv'd to
eat a great dish of Milk and Cucumbers, and so to
walk to the <HI>Fauxburgh</HI> St. <HI>Marcel,</HI> where he had
some business.</P>

his pace. Nevertheless the Cucumbers, not
brooking delays, and urging hard for liberty, he
search'd about for one of those <HI>Adepkana's,</HI> so well
wash'd and so convenient as in his own Country.
But not being able to discover any thing but shops
open, and streets throng'd with people, wherein it
was not so proper to discharge a burthen of that
importance as his was, you may believe him to have
been perhaps one of the most disconsolate men in
<HI>Paris,</HI> not knowing what course to take in such a
disorder of his body.</P>
<P>This bitter affiction caus'd him with sighs to
wish himself in the <HI>Geroon</HI> of <HI>Damasco,</HI> which is a
great place wall'd in, containing near Forty
of these necessary houses. He curs'd all the
streets of <HI>Paris,</HI> and would have given the whole
City, as rich and populous as it is, for his own
dispeopled lowsie <HI>Antiochia.</HI> He long'd for one of
the <HI>Turkish</HI> Mosquees, rather out of respect to their
<HI>Adepkana's,</HI> than out of any devotion at that time.
At last, as he told me, in the height of his extremity
he thus lamented his misfortune. <HI>Were I now</HI>
(said he to himself) <HI>at</HI> Grand Cairo, <HI>my pains would
find redress, by only bowing the head and crying, accor|ding
to custome, to the Passengers,</HI> Kouf nadarak ja sidi,
<HI>or,</HI> Pray (Sir) look another way. <HI>But here in</HI>
Paris, <HI>where there are more people than stones in the
<PB N="196" REF="120">
street, what shall a man do in my forlorn condition?</HI>
But all these sad complaints little avail'd the
distressed <HI>Syrian.</HI> For before he could get over <HI>Pont
au change,</HI> the Cucumbers grew so importunately
outragious, that they forc'd open his back doors,
and breaking Prison <HI>vi &amp; armis,</HI> gave the disconso|late
<HI>Syrian</HI> to understand, that Milk and Cucum|bers
was not so sweet as Milk and Honey. What
would he now have given for the hot and
wholesome Baths in the Island of <HI>Milo,</HI> where he
might have stript himself privately, and spent his
time like one of the Muses in <HI>Helicon,</HI> till his Cloaths
might have been wash'd, or new habit fetch'd?
But there was no help; therefore he must endure
the smell, as he had made several others as he
pass'd along.</P>
<P>I will not here repeat all the Curses, with which
he laded also the City of <HI>Marseilles,</HI> where a man in
a morning, if he take not a great care to carry his
Ears with him when he goes abroad, may happen
to be well moistn'd with a sort of very thick and

<P>Now though the number of these Rinsers be
very great, considering the Marry'd men are ty'd
to this Purification as well as the Batchelours,
nevertheless they never change the water, till every
one has rins'd himself, and in the action said the
usual Prayer, <HI>La illa illalla, Allam dulilla, Alla
hecher,</HI> or some other to the same purpose.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of their Abdest or Ablution.</HEAD>
<P>THe fourth and last preparation for Prayers is
the <HI>Abdest:</HI> And this may be done with
herbs or stones, where there is no conveniency of
water. They believe that God (who regards the
inside, and not the outside of men) would not hear
their supplications, if they had not appeas'd him
before-hand, at least to the utmost of their power,
by this <HI>Abdest:</HI> And also that their Prayers put up
in that state of impurity would rather draw down
the wrath of Heaven upon them, than procure the
blessings of God, without the assistance of <HI>Abdest.</HI>
For which reason they never erect any Mosquee
<PB N="198" REF="121">
without the convenience of Fountains, as I have
shew'd already.</P>
<P>It will be needless therefore to relate in what
manner this <HI>Abdest</HI> is perform'd. All people know
well, that they wash the best part of the head and
neck, the arms to the Elbows, their feet, the
end of the Priapus, and the posteriour Orifice.
However I must needs, tell ye, that these severe
injunctions of washing so often, are very trouble|some
to those that live in dry places far remote
from water, and to those that live in the Northern
cold Climates; which is the reason that several
<HI>Turks</HI> could wish with all their hearts that they
might be permitted to change their Religion, which
tyes them to so many inconvenient slabberings.</P>
<P>To this purpose I will relate what I heard said
by one of those <HI>Turks,</HI> who they call <HI>Raphasis-ler,</HI>
these are a sort of Mahometan Hereticks, very
numerous in <HI>Syria,</HI> and several parts of lesser <HI>Asia.</HI>
This person, in obedience to some Religious Vow,
had oblig'd himself to undertake a journey to
<HI>Mecca,</HI> to which the honest Musselmen are bound,
at least once in their lives. He being in the same
opinion with the rest of the <HI>Caravan,</HI> that they
should meet with water at such a certain Well or
Cistern upon the Road, (which the heat of the Sun
had dry'd up, contrary to their hopes,) had made
use of the best part of his provision of water as the
rest had done, upon this Ceremony of <HI>Abdest,</HI>
which the devotion of that Pilgrimage fre|quently
requires. By which means finding
themselves in the midst of the Sands, Deserts, and
Heats of <HI>Arabia,</HI> they knew not what course to
take in that extremity of drowth which tormented
them to impatience. Nor was he of the number of
those who had over much Gold, to purchase of those
<PB N="199" REF="121">
who had been more provident: And indeed they
had too much need themselves, for him to hope,
they would be perswaded to give gratis to others.
So that the poor <HI>Raphasis</HI> found himself reduc'd to
endure a scorching drowth, and ready to be buried
alive in the stifling Clouds of Sand, which the Wind
raises in that miserable Road.</P>
<P>The remembrance of this extremity, from which
nothing but the natural strength of his Body had
preserv'd him, inspir'd him with more execrations
of <HI>Mahomet</HI> and his accursed errours, than the most
zealous of the Eastern Christians could have in|vented
for him. He said, <Q>He did not wish the
Devil had taken him, for he did not believe him
so unjust as to let that Impostor scape his fury,
who being the sole cause of the death of so many
Millions of people as perish'd in going to <HI>Mecca,</HI>
justly deserv'd to suffer as many deaths in Hell, as
he had caus'd poor creatures to suffer torments in
his infamous cruel Pilgrimage; but he wish'd
with all his heart, that Heaven had Thunder struck
from above, and that Hell had then swallow'd
in flames, the first contrivers of that accursed
<HI>Alcoran,</HI> and the unfortunate Propagators of the
Law of <HI>Mahomet;</HI> or that it had been his fortune
to have been a Christian like us.</Q></P>
<P>I was strangely surpriz'd to hear a <HI>Turk</HI>
Blaspheme his own Religion in that manner before
two Christians; and therefore fearing he had some
treacherous design upon me, could he have but
heard me speak any words upon which he might
lay hold, I ask'd my Companion, who that <HI>Rapha|sis</HI>
was? and wherefore he talk'd after that fashion?
He told me, the reason was, because those <HI>Raphases</HI>
being neither Christians nor <HI>Turks,</HI> had not the
liberty to declare themselves for the one nor the
<PB N="200" REF="122">
other. That outwardly they conform'd to all
the exercises of the Mahometan Religion, but that
in their hearts they believ'd not one tittle of
it, and that moreover they were all at this lock,
that if any among them renounc'd his <HI>Raphaisme</HI>
to become a sincere Mahometan, they receiv'd his
abjuration, but pursu'd him afterwards to death,
with no less malice, than if he had turn'd Christian.</P>
<P>The fifth sort of <HI>Turkish</HI> washing is that which
they call <HI>Eulu-iak maghi,</HI> or the washing of the
dead, of which I shall say nothing till I have
done with their Ceremonies before Prayer, this not
being in practice till after the decease of the
party.</P>
<P>Now therefore after a true Musselman has per|form'd
all his purifications, it behoves him to go
to Church with his eyes fix'd upon the ground, and
to bear in mind the profound reverence which he
ought to pay to that place, and to make his entry
bare foot, or only cover'd with his Trouses. Which
necessity of pulling off their shoes so often, has
caus'd the Eastern people to invent a sort of shoes
or slippers which they call <HI>Papouches,</HI> with one single
sole, and the upper leather of Goats skin tann'd, and
dy'd yellow, red, violet, or black. The <HI>Turks</HI> and
<HI>Franks</HI> usually wear them yellow, the <HI>Armenians</HI>
red, the Jews black, and the <HI>Greeks</HI> violet. But
none of these Nations are permitted to wear them
green in any part of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Dominion, which
they may do in the <HI>Persian</HI> Territories. It would
be a great crime for a Christian to wear upon his
feet a colour which the Mahometans look upon as
sacred, in regard it was the colour which their
Prophet so much affected, and which the <HI>Turks</HI>
therefore never put, but with great respect upon
their heads, as serving to distinguish their <HI>Emirs,</HI>
<PB N="201" REF="122">
who are allow'd to wear a green Bonnet, as a
mark of their being ally'd to their great Prophet
and Legislator.</P>
<P>Which puts me in mind of the witty answer that
the great <HI>Sha Abbas</HI> gave to the Grand Signors Em|bassadour.
This <HI>Elchi,</HI> or Embassador, from the
<HI>Ottoman</HI> Port, being very much troubled to see the
Christians as well as <HI>Turks,</HI> over all <HI>Persia,</HI> wearing
green shoes and Trouses, in the name of his Master,
requir'd <HI>Sha Abbas</HI> to forbid his Subjects any longer
to prophane a colour, which all true Mahometans
ought to have a greater veneration for; that he
very well understood, that it being the Prophets pe|culiar
colour, it did not behove the happy observers
of his Law, to cover any other part of the body
with it than the head, or at least the more decent
parts of the body above the wast, and that it became
him not with such an insupportable contempt to
trample under foot a colour so sacred, as his
Subjects not only did, but also the <HI>Giaurs,</HI> the
<HI>Chifoutlers,</HI> or Jews, and all other <HI>Mordars,</HI> or
impure Nations, over all his Dominions, un|punish'd.</P>
<P><HI>Sha Abbas,</HI> who was the most accomplish'd
Prince in all the East, whose noble qualities gain'd
him the affection of all the world, perceiv'd hereby
the injustice of the <HI>Ottomans,</HI> which was to
hinder all men, if it were in their power, to make
use of that colour, of which Nature it self had
made them a Precedent, and set them so fair an ex|ample
to wear at their discretion, as being the
universal Carpet which she has spread upon the
surface of the Earth for man to tread upon, which
made him resolve to make a Jest of the Ridiculous
proposal of the Embassador.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="123">
At first therefore he made a shew of consenting to
the Grand Signor's desire, and promis'd the Em|bassadour
<HI REND="margQuotes">That he would take order that his
Subjects should no longer prophane the Prophets
colour, hoping that the Grand Signor would
issue forth the fame orders over all his Dominions,
to restrain within his own Territories the abuse
of that sacred colour, for which he seem'd so
zealous. For, (said the Prince to the Embassador)
your Master beholds every day a greater propha|nation
of that colour, and yet suffers it to go un|punish'd.
My Subjects only wear the colour dead
upon their shoes and trouses, but all the Beasts in
<HI>Turkie</HI> dung without any penalty upon the <HI>Grass,</HI>
which is the living colour that <HI>Mahomet</HI> lov'd.
Therefore if he will prohibit all the Beasts in
<HI>Turkie</HI> from defiling the green Grass with their
excrements, which they do continually, then I will
take care my Subjects shall wear green shoes no
longer.</HI> The <HI>Elchi</HI> finding by the answer of <HI>Sha
Abbas,</HI> that he did but laugh at the folly of his Pro|position,
with-drew forthwith out of the <HI>Talare,</HI>
or Room of State where the <HI>Persian</HI> Kings give
publick audience to Embassadors, to admire his
own yellow Papouches, which he had left at the
door, according to the custome, when the <HI>Turks</HI>
enter into any Mosquee or Room of Grandeur
which deserves their veneration; and left the <HI>Per|sians</HI>
to their own liberty.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>Of the Turks behaviour during
Prayer time.</HEAD>
<P>IT were to be wish'd, that all Christians who are
wanting in their duty at Church, and little heed
the Prayers they make, might sometimes observe
<PB N="203" REF="123">
after what manner the <HI>Turks</HI> acquit themselves,
of that strict obligation which tyes all men to put
up their supplications to Heaven with all humi|lity
and attention. Certainly they might learn
from them, not to enter the Church of God so
irreverently, with a soul defil'd with the conta|minations
of sin, when they observe how careful
the <HI>Turks</HI> are to wash away what ever defilement
their bodies or habits may have contracted: They
might learn to leave at the Church doors all their
worldly entreagues, and not to make the places ap|pointed
for Prayer, their rendevouses for discourse,
and particular designes, when they observe the
<HI>Turks</HI> leaving their shoes at the Mosquee door, and
keeping silence with so much awe and modesty
during Prayer time, that can never be too much
commended.</P>
<P>In consideration of which Prayers, perform'd and
said with so much modesty, the <HI>Ottomans</HI> believe that
God has made them Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ters of the most fertile parts
of the world: But that we may not only believe
what comes from the Mouth of a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> I
will relate what a <HI>Greek</HI> Christian one day told me,
in discourse about the Prophanation of the Church.
He was born at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and about Fourscore
years of age, whose Father and Grand father had
also counted an Hundred successively. He liv'd near
<HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> and having observ'd me, several times,
going into the <HI>Portico</HI> of that <HI>Mosquee,</HI> the fear
which he had lest my frequent visits of the <HI>Turkish</HI>
Temple, might produce in me, a desire to change
my Religion, or endanger me to be constrain'd so
to do, oblig'd him out of his charitable zeal to ac|cost
me, and to ask me, if it might not seem an im|pertinent
question, what it was that mov'd me to go
so frequently to <HI>Sancta Sophia?</HI> I answer'd him, that it
<PB N="204" REF="124">
was the beauty of the Mosquee that drew me thither,
and that I could not forbear viewing so ancient a
Temple, which had so long entertain'd the sacred
Mysteries of Christianity.</P>
<P>The good old man, trembling, took me by the
hand, and with tears in his eyes, <HI>Ah Son</HI> (said he)
<HI>had our Forefathers never enter'd into</HI> Sancta Sophia,
<HI>but with that reverence which now the</HI> Turks <HI>observe,
we had still been Masters both of Church and City. But,</HI>
continu'd he, <HI>God who is always jealous of the honour of
his own house, has punish'd more grievously this sin of
the</HI> Greeks, <HI>than all the other Offences which ever they
committed.</HI> After which he told me what his
Grand-father had long before observ'd upon this
subject, and confirm'd to me, that the vain-glory of
the <HI>Greeks</HI> was arriv'd at such a height in the Reigns
of the last Christian Emperours, that persons of
Quality, and such as had any Estates, were wont to
ride into the Church on Horseback, or else were
carry'd into it in Litters, where their Horses and
Mules frequently dung'd. He added also, that
<HI>Mahomet</HI> the II. who took <HI>Constantinople,</HI> had not pre|sum'd
to have enter'd the Temple in that manner,
but that he was over perswaded, that if the <HI>Greeks</HI>
made no scruple of riding into the Church, he
might do it as well as they, and not alight till he
came to the Altar, which he first made use of in
stead of a Horse-block, and then fell to Prayers
upon it.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Mahometans</HI> behave themselves after
another manner. They never come to Prayers,
but in a posture so modest and so humble, that it is
impossible to imagine a submission more profound.
For after they have perform'd all their ceremony's
of washing, and put off their shoes at the door of the
Mosquee, they endeavour to place themselves as
<PB N="205" REF="124">
near the <HI>Iman,</HI> as they can; yet not so as to crowd
or thrust those that stand before them; there they
kneel and sit upon their heels, which is the posture
that the <HI>Ottomans</HI> believe to be the most humble, ex|pecting
in that form the beginning of Prayers,
no man daring all the while so much as to Whisper
to his next neighbour.</P>
<P>Prayer time being come, the <HI>Iman</HI> rises, and
standing upright, carries his two hands open to his
head, and stopping his Ears with his Thumbs, casts
his eyes up to Heaven, and sings very loud and very
distinctly the Prayer, while the people follow him
with a low voice and imitate all his Postures. I
shall not hear repeat the words of the Prayer, as
well for that there are few who understand them, as
that I may not give the Eastern Christians occasion
to blame me as they have done some other
Travellers, who have written them down in their
Relations, accusing them as if they had an intention
to teach the Christians to pray to God after the
<HI>Turkish</HI> manner, beside the danger that may happen,
lest any one finding the <HI>Namas</HI> or <HI>Turkish</HI> Prayers
in our Relations, and getting them by heart, should
afterwards be heard to repeat them (never thinking
of the danger of so doing) in any part of the <HI>Turkish</HI>
Dominions, in Mahometan company; which would
be a crime not to be forgiven, but by the change of
his Religion. It shall therefore suffice to tell the
signification of the <HI>Arabic</HI> words which the <HI>Turks</HI>
pronounce in their Prayer, which are taken out of
the first Chapter of the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> having first repre|sented
the posture mark'd with the figure I.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fig. X.</NOTE>
which is the posture the <HI>Turks</HI> observe at the
beginning of their <HI>Namas.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> lifting up their eyes and hands to
Heaven at the first beginning of their Divine
<PB N="206" REF="125">
Worship, cry twice, <HI>Milla hirrakhman irrahimi,</HI>
that is to say, <HI>in the name of God, gracious and merciful,</HI>
then letting fall their hands below the Girdle, as in
the second posture mark'd 2, they say (with their
eyes fix'd upon the earth) the Prayer which they
call the <HI>Fatiche</HI> or <HI>Fatha,</HI> which signifies the preface,
as being taken out of the Exordium of the Alcoran,
in these words following.</P>
<P>Praise be given to God, who is the Lord of worlds, all
love and mercy. O great King of the day of judgment,
we adore thee, we trust in thee, preserve us, (seeing
we invoke thy name) in the right way of those whom
thou hast elected, and whom thou cherishest with thy
favours, and not in the way of those against whom thy
wrath is kindled, nor of Infidels and wanderers from
thy truth. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>This Prayer being said, they bow their bodies,
clapping their hands upon their knces, as in the
posture mark'd with the direction 3. saying <HI>Alla heu
Hecber,</HI> and the rest as follows.</P>
<P>God is great; O my God let Glory be given to thee,
and together with thy praise may thy name be blessed, and
thy Grandeur be advanc'd. For there is no other God
but thee.</P>
<P>After this, accompanying the <HI>Iman,</HI> or the person
that reads prayers, they cry out with a loud Voice
<HI>Alla Hecber, O great God.</HI> And prostrating them|selves
upon the earth, they kiss it twice; as in the
Posture mark'd 4. crying out as many times, <HI>Alla
Herber, O great God.</HI></P>
<P>These bowings of the body they call <HI>Rekiets,</HI>
differing in number according to the hours of
Prayer-time. In the Morning six times; at Noon
eight; six at <HI>Kimdi;</HI> eight at evening Prayer; and
as many at midnight; when the solemnities of <HI>Regeb,
Chaban,</HI> or <HI>Ramazan,</HI> oblige them to rise at
<PB N="207" REF="125">
midnight to betake themselves to the Mosquee.</P>
<P>When the first of these Bowings is over, they
rise again and repeat the <HI>Fatha</HI> preceding, which
they say standing upright, without putting their
thumbs in their eares. Afterwards they always
continue the same Prayer, till they have repeated as
many Genuflexions, as the hour of the day requires.
Which done, they return to their first posture of
sitting upon their knees, looking in their hands
open'd, as if they were reading their own fortunes,
as in the postures mark'd 5, 6. and recite a certain
number of benedictions and praises to God, which
they count upon the joynts of their fingers. Which
Benedictions and Praises are certain Thanksgivings
to God for having heard their Prayers, sometimes
they address themselves to <HI>Mahomet,</HI> crying out
often <HI>Resul Alla,</HI> which signifies <HI>the Messenger of God.</HI>
But usually they make their Applications to God
alone; saying, <HI>Subhan alla, God be prais'd. Allem
dullila,</HI> or <HI>praise to God. La illa ill alla. There is no
other God but God.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus finish'd all their <HI>Rekiets,</HI> and done
kissing the Ground, at the conclusion they take
themselves by the beard, and turning to the right
and left hand salute the two Angels whom they
beleive to be attending always upon them, the one
to incite them to virtue, the other to accuse them
for the evil they commit. These Angels they reckon
to be one good the other bad: The one white, the
other black: The dull and material apprehensions
of the <HI>Turks</HI> rather distinguishing those incorporeal
substances by their colour, than by their spirituality.
I shall not here insist upon the dreams and fables
which they report concerning these two Angels,
or of the Visions of <HI>Gabriel,</HI> who as they say always
appear'd to their <HI>Cheiks</HI> and <HI>Derviches</HI> for the revela|tion
<PB N="208" REF="126">
of some new mystery. It is enough to shew you
in the postures, mark'd 7 8. the gestures which the
<HI>Mahometans</HI> observe when they salute those two
Angels.</P>
<P>When the Musselmen have ended their Prayers,
which never last longer than half an hour, certain
chanters meet together in the small Balcones,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See Fig.</HI> VIII.</NOTE> mark'd
in the description of <HI>Sancta Sophia</HI> with the letter D.
and sing in counterpoint notes certain Songs which
are not unpleasing; after which, on <HI>Mondays, Wed|nesdays</HI>
and <HI>Fridays,</HI> a Preacher mounts the Pulpit,
and expounds to the Auditors, some point of the
Alcoran after his own manner. sometimes likewife
they Preach in the Market places; and they always
conclude their devotions with certain Prayers for
the prosperity of the sultan, and his Arms against
his enemies, to which the people being present, make
no other answer than <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<HEAD>What the Turks do after Prayers.</HEAD>
<P>THe worship of God being the chiefest of all
humane Actions, of which Prayer is the principal
part, it may be hence concluded, that all the other
affairs of the <HI>Turks,</HI> as well as of all other people,
are to be postpon'd to Prayer. But in regard that
all men follow different employments, according to
the diversity of their Genius; I shall reduce all the
business of the Mahometans into three particular
Heads. The Ecclesiastical Affairs, the Business of the
<HI>Divan,</HI> and the popular Employments. To the
first appertains the Duty of Prayer; to the
second the Execution of Justice; to the last belong
the Trades of the People and their Military Exer|cises.</P>

<HEAD>of the Turkish Mosquees or Temples.</HEAD>
<P>AT what time the <HI>Turks</HI> begun to set up the
first exercise of their Religion, they perform'd
their Divine Worship in the open fields, and before
all the world, as they still continue to do in such
places where they have no Mosquees. But after
their Empire began to enlarge, and that they had
won several Towns from the Christians, they also
made use of their Churches to practice therein the
ceremonies of their own Religion: And when
they had occasion to. build Mosquees, they took
their Models from those of the Christians, not
being Architects skilful enough to erect them after
their own proper and particular manner. And
this is the reason that all the Mosquees in <HI>Constan|tinople</HI>
are but imperfect copies of <HI>Sancta Sophia.</HI>
They have only added some Towers and Portico's
adorn'd with Fountains after their custome. As
may be easily observ'd in the Draught of the three
fairest Mosquees in <HI>Constantinople</HI> hereunto annex'd.
Of which I shall only explain the Directions, there
needing no more than only to observe the platform
and the out-side work for the more easie appre|hending
what is most remarkable.</P>

<HEAD>The New Mosquee, situated in the

<P><HI>SUltan Achmed's</HI> Mosquee may pass for o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the
most beautiful as to the out-side, which ever
the <HI>Turks</HI> erected, it being the only Temple of all
that ever I saw in the East, which has six Towers,
whereas the rest have not above Two or
Four at most. These Six Towers are very
high, having every one three Galleries a piece, so
wrought that you may see through them in divers
places, though they are built of white hard stone,
not much unlike to Marble. Every one of these
have within them a pair of winding stairs.</P>
<P>Now in regard these Towers are very high, and
the winds very boysterous at <HI>Constantinople,</HI> it may
be thought such sort of Buildings should be subject
to frequent downfalls; this cosinderation caus'd
Monsieur <HI>Colbert,</HI> whose knowledge of things is as
general, as of large extent, to ask me whether they
did not often tumble down? I answered him,
that those Towers being wrought very smooth
and round, they did not make resistance sufficient
to give the Winds power to shake them: Besides
that the Stones are mortass'd one within another,
and bound together with a very strong and stiff
cement, so that there has not been observ'd the fall
of any Tower erected upon the Ruins of the Chri|stian
Buildings, for above these two Hundred years.</P>
<P>This Mosquee Built by <HI>Sultan Achmet,</HI> is situated
in the largest <HI>Piazza</HI> belonging to the City of
<HI>Constantinople,</HI> formerly call'd the <HI>Hippodrome,</HI>
because it was the place where they ran their
Horse-Races; and being still made use of for the
same purpose, the <HI>Turks</HI> give it the name of <HI>At|meidan,
<PB N="211" REF="128">
The place for the Horses.</HI> This <HI>Piazza,</HI>
which I have not describ'd as being already done by
others, lyes to the west of the Temple, as also the
famous Serraglio of <HI>Ibrahim Basha,</HI> which is a far
better piece of Architecture in some of our <HI>Romances,</HI>
than it appears to be in the <HI>Hippodrome;</HI> to the
North-East and South-East side of it, toward the
Channel of the Black-Sea, lye the delightful
Landskips of <HI>Scutari, Calcedon, Fanari-sckio,</HI> and of
the Plains, Hills and Valleys, that environ them.
The <HI>Isles</HI> of the <HI>Princes</HI> and the <HI>Propontis</HI> appear to
the South, with a part of the City; and upon the
North and North-West side stands the Church of
<HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> the City of <HI>Gelata,</HI> the
Haven of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and all the Suburbs which
are very large: So that the top of this Mosquee,
and the Towers that environ it, afford one of the
most delightful prospects in the whole world.</P>
<P>Although the <HI>Hippodrome,</HI> which is a <HI>Piazza</HI>
almost twice as big as the <HI>Place Royal</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> ly
just before the Mosquee; yet there is also another
large square, to enclose the Building, which is se|parated
from the <HI>Atmeidan</HI> by a low wall, about
Fourscore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">athom in length, having in it Seventy
two Windows with Iron Grates, and three Gates, of
which one stands in the middle, and the other two
at each end of the wall, being all three barricadoed
with Iron chains, like the doors of all the rest of
the Mosquees. This Church-yard, if it may be
so call'd, is planted with Trees, making several
straight walks, especially on the North-side
where the Founder lyes entomb'd, as also that un|fortunate
Prince <HI>Sultan Osman,</HI> who was put to
death in the Seven Towers.</P>
<P>Now though this Mosquee may be said to be the
most beautiful in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> if not in all the
<PB N="212" REF="129">
East, yet there is not any more irregularly built in
all the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, not only against the Laws
of Architecture, but also contrary to the Mahome|tan
injunctions.</P>
<P>'Tis true, that in regard it requires a vast expence
to erect a Mosquee, therefore the Grand Signors
are expresly forbid to undertake so difficult an
enterprize until they shall have won from the Infi|dels,
Cities, Provinces, or Kingdoms sufficient to
defray the excessive charges of such magnificent
Piles. However <HI>Sultan Achmet,</HI> though he had not
by any conquest extended the bounds of the Em|pire,
resolv'd to Build a Mosquee, to the end he
might eternize his name, since his atchievements did
not suffice to recommend him to posterity. And
though the <HI>Mufti,</HI> the <HI>Mulla's</HI> the <HI>Cheiks,</HI> and
other Doctors of the Law, laid before him the sin of
undertaking to erect such a costly fabrick, since he
had never been in any other Combats, than those
which are daily to be seen for the exercise of the
pages, and divertisement of the Prince, nevertheless
he gave little heed to their admonitions, but
carried on the work with a vigour answerable to
his resolutions; and when he had finish'd the Pile,
because he had slighted his Chaplains exhorta|tions,
call'd it <HI>Imansis Gianisi,</HI> or the Temple of
the Incredulous. It is also call'd the new Mosquee,
as being one of the last that was Built.</P>
<P>The whole body of this Mosquee is of a square
figure, cover'd with a <HI>Domo,</HI> not so proportionable
as it should have been to the rest. It is suppor|ted
within, by Four large thick round Pillars, and
the Arches which, winding over them, sustain the
four half Domes that encompass the great one,
are the occasion that the Building is neither very
Roomy, nor over light. Before you enter the
<PB N="213" REF="129">
Mosquee you must pass through a very lovely
Court, surrounded with a Cloister&punc; supported with
Six and Twenty Arches, which have every one of
them their Roof and their Cupola cover'd with
Lead. All these little Domes are supported by
Twenty Six Columns of speckl'd <HI>Egyptian</HI> Marble
very neatly turn'd, but their Chapters are after the
<HI>Turkish</HI> manner; all the space which they environ is
pav'd with square Marble, in the midst of which
stands a Fountain of an Hexagon figure, built of the
same stone. This prostile or Court is rais'd very
high; there being no less than Thirteen steps up
to it. The rest of the Building may better be seen
and understood in the following Plate, to which I

<HEAD>Of the Solimany.</HEAD>
<P>IF ever Emperour of the <HI>Turks</HI> merited accor|ding
to their Law to erect a Temple, in regard
of the Conquests he had made upon the enemies of
the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Grandeur, assuredly <HI>Sultan Soliman</HI>
was the person, the second who bore that name,
and the Fourteenth Emperour of the Musselmen.
All the three parts of the Hemisphere serv'd only
to be the large&punc; Theater where he acted the fatal
Tragedies of War. The unfortunate <HI>Rhodes</HI> was
one of the first places in <HI>Asia,</HI> that became the de|plorable
subject of his Triumphs. A good part of
the Kingdom of <HI>Persia,</HI> of which he took upon him
the Imperial Diadem at <HI>Bagdat,</HI> submitted to his
fortune, after he had won <HI>Herzeron, Irivan, Thauris,</HI>
and several other places. He also made himself
Master of <HI>Tunis</HI> and <HI>Tripoli</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> and wrested
a great part of <HI>Hungry</HI> from the <HI>European</HI> Poten|tates,
taking the Cities of <HI>Buda, Alba Regalis,</HI> and
the Fort of <HI>Sigeth</HI> some days even after his death
at <HI>Quinque Ecclesiae.</HI></P>
<P>This Prince, (who was Proclaim'd Emperour of
the <HI>Turks</HI> the same year that <HI>Charles</HI> the V. was
<PB N="216" REF="132">
Crown'd Emperour of the <HI>Germans</HI>) after his return
to <HI>Constantinople</HI> from the Conquests of <HI>Rhodes,</HI>
and <HI>Bagdat,</HI> caus'd that stately Mosquee to be
erected, to which he gave his own name, to the
end that it might remain to Posterity a faithful and
eternal Monument of his Victories. This Temple
is one of those where Mahometan Architecture has
follow'd the strictest Rules of Art, being no less
beautiful within than without, and Built like the
rest upon a square Foundation, cover'd in the
middle with a large <HI>Domo,</HI> no way inferiour ei|ther
in beauty or figure to that of <HI>Sancta Sophia.</HI>
This Domo is sustain'd with four large Pillars
mark'd in the Draught Fig. XIII. with the letter D.
and between these Pillars to the North and South,
stand two great massie speckl'd Marble Columns,
all of a piece, that form three Arches, which bear
a piece of the wall, and strengthen the great Arch
of the great Pillars which stand at a very wide
distance.</P>
<P>To these Four great Pillars within, there are
Two others that answer without, to which they
serve as buttresses, so far however from deformity,
that they rather please the eye; as you may observe
in the Plate of the outside, Fig. XII. at the letter D.
Within these outermost Buttresses runs up a little
pair of stairs leading to the Roof, and Domes of
the Temple, to which you may easily ascend by
another pair of stairs that are above without side,
mark'd by the letter B.</P>
<P>Between these Buttresses are three Windows that
enlighten the sides of the Church, under which
Windows are two very fair Galleries, roof'd and
cover'd with Lead, and supported with several
Marble Pillars, with their Chapters after the <HI>Turkish</HI>
manner, as at the letter G. and a little lower at
<PB N="217" REF="132">
F. are the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ountains wherein to wash before
Prayers begin.</P>
<P>On the right side of these Fountains, at the
letter E. stands a little round door, at the foot of
several steps, leading up to a little lattic'd Gallery,
through which the Grand Signor ascends into his
Closet, alighting first from his Horse upon a stone
cut into steps, and mark'd with the letter Q. A
little beyond, at the direction L. is the Garden
where Sultan <HI>Soliman</HI> the Founder and his Wife lye
interr'd, and into which you may enter through the
door mark'd H. or another which is opposite to it;
which door is barricado'd with a chain, as you
may see in the Draught of the North part, Fig. XII.</P>
<P>I have already told the Reader, that the Eastern
people know no such evil custom as that of Burying
their Dead within the walls of their Churches, let
their Quality or Wealth be never so considerable.
But for all that, the Emperours many times dispense
with that custom so far, as to reserve to themselves
a Burying place near to the Mosquees of their own
Erecting. And therfore <HI>Soliman,</HI> than whom no
man had a greater care of infringing the laudable
customs of good Government and Order, would
not have his bones laid within the Temple, but re|serv'd
for himself a Sepulcher in the Garden behind
his Mosquee, which in the Draught is mark'd with
the letter I. This Tomb is the most regular and
best piece of workmanship in all <HI>Constantinople,</HI>
being of an Octagon figure, encompass'd without
with a Gallery, of which the roof is supported with
Fifteen small Marble Pillars; and within is also
another small octangular Gallery, having a green
Marble Column erected at each Angle, with their
Pedestals and Chapters of white Marble, which
form as many Arches, that support the Domo. In
<PB N="218" REF="133">
the midst of this Sepulcher is the Tomb it self of
<HI>Soliman</HI> and his Son, at the foot of which stands a
large Taper in a Candle-stick of Copper. Round
about are several woodden <HI>Lecterns</HI> or high Desks,
where the <HI>Softa's</HI> lay their books, when they come to
pray for his Soul.</P>
<P>In the same Garden is also the Sepulcher of
<HI>Soliman</HI>'s Wife, mark'd with the letter K. For as
the <HI>Turks</HI> never admit their Wives to pray with 'em
when they are alive, so they never suffer them to
lye with 'em in the same Tomb, when they are dead.
Believing their old Wives shall never be admitted
to accompany them into Paradice, where they
hope to find far younger and handsomer, leaving
their cast-terrestrial Wives to make much of the
<HI>Giaurs,</HI> whose lot they pretend it will be to stand
without doors. Not far off are the Houses of
Easement for the <HI>Softa's,</HI> of whom there are a vast
number employ'd to take care of <HI>Soliman</HI>'s future
happiness, as one that left great Pensions behind
him for that purpose.</P>
<P>But besides these necessary conveniencies, there
are also adjoyning to all your Royal Foundations
certain <HI>Timarkana's</HI> or Almes-Houses, where there is
a daily distribution of Bread and <HI>Chorva,</HI> which is a
certain sort of Pottage, or some other sort of Almes,
which extends not only to the men, but also to the
dogs, who are a great object of <HI>Turkish</HI> Charity.
For though they will rather build kenels for them
in the street than suffer them to come within their
doors, or to lick the same dish wherein, men have
eaten before, (for which depraved custome of the
<HI>Europeans,</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> reproach them with the name
of <HI>Kupekler</HI>) yet they will admit the poor Currs to
partake of their Almes very freely. On the left
side of this Mosquee are several little Domes, which
<PB REF="134">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>The Solimannie Built by Soliman the Magnificent.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="219" REF="135">
reach from the Two great Towers to the Two
little ones, whose Cupola's cover the Arches, and
all the compass of the <HI>Cloister</HI> that lyes before the
entrance into the Temple. In the midst of which
is a large Water-work, that feeds Ten Fountains
for the use of the Musselmen in their continual
dablings.</P>
<P>The Two Towers next the Mosquee are crown'd
with three very high Galleries, but they which
stand at the end of the Court are lower, and circled
only with Two Galleries, for the use of the
<HI>Muezins.</HI> These two little Towers terminate the
whole Building, which is in the middle of a large
Court, planted round with Trees, environ'd with
a Wall, wherein are several open Windows grated
and Barr'd, as may be seen in the Draughts of the
Elevation and Platform.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Mosquee of Validea, built by the
Sultaness, Mother of the present
Grand Signor.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="subpart">
<P>'TIs not a usual thing in <HI>Turkie,</HI> for the <HI>Sulta|nesses</HI>
to build Mosquees. Only this was a
peculiar priviledge which the Mother of the Grand
Signor now Raigning, obtain'd by her extraordi|nary
wit and cunning, as having by the same Arti|fices
obtain'd an entire freedome, and credit over
all the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire. This Temple which is
the last Monument of Mahometan piety, to my
thinking is one of the most elegant and most exact
pieces of workmanship of all the rest which are in
<HI>Constantinople.</HI> And indeed it was no more than
might be well expected from the Sultaness <HI>Validea,</HI>
the Wife of <HI>Ibrahim</HI> the I. and Mother of <HI>Mahomet</HI>
the IV. who being one of the most aspiring and ac|complish'd
Lady's that ever enter'd the <HI>Seraglio,</HI>
would most certainly spare for no cost, when she
had once design'd to eternize her memory by a
curiosity in Architecture. To which intent she could
not have chosen a situation more advantageous or
more favourable to her purpose, as intending there|by
to oblige all the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Princes descending
from her issue, and all the people in subjection to
their Laws, together with all such strangers as
should come to <HI>Constantinople,</HI> to bear her in remem|brance,
while the one admir'd the sublimity of her
parts in carrying on, and bringing to perfection a
work so rarely thought of by those of her sex
among the <HI>Turks,</HI> and from the other she procur'd
to her self that happiness which she expected by
vertue of the supplications of those, who beholding
<PB N="224" REF="138">
the beauty of her female Fabrick, would be con|tinually
praying for the eternal rest of her soul.
She therefore made choice for the situation of her
Mosquee, of a piece of ground not far from the
<HI>Seraglio,</HI> and at a very little distance from those
lovely <HI>Kioscs,</HI> which the <HI>Grand Signor</HI> erected to
give his Sultanesses the pleasure of viewing the
Port of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and all the Vessels that sail'd
in and out.</P>
<P>This Temple is erected upon a square Founda|tion
in a large circuit of ground, environ'd by the
walls of the City to the North and West: The
south space is taken up with a <HI>Bazar</HI> or Market-house,
and her own Sepulcher, both which she added
to her Religious structure. The East part is en|clos'd
with another wall, wherein is the principal
entrance into the enclosure, in such a place as an|swers
to one of the Gates of the City, not far
distant from the <HI>Seraglio</HI> Gardens.</P>
<P>Having therefore describ'd the several parts of
the preceding Mosquees, I shall make no farther de|scription
of this, in regard that excepting its par|ticular
beauty, it differs in other respects little or
nothing from the rest. For, like those others, it
shews its Galleries high and low, its fountains under|neath,
two Towers with three Balcones a piece,
several Semi-Domes, Cupola's and Lanterns,
as also its Court before the Grand Entrance:
Only it excells all the rest of her sister Mos|quees
in the beauty of its situation. For it is
seated by the Sea shore, near to one of the lesser
Harbours of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and which is the most
frequented of all, by reason of the Custome-house
close by, and the neighborhood of the <HI>New Bazar,</HI> or

on fire near <HI>Validea,</HI> when this Wind rages, by one
private way or other, of which many might be
found out, and he would certainly see the sad but
assured success of his enterprize.</P>
<P>They call this wind <HI>Kara-iel</HI> or the <HI>black wind,</HI>
not only because it blows from the <HI>Black-Sea,</HI> but in
regard of the fatal effects which it produces, it
being the occasion of dismal losses to those that
Sail from <HI>Cuffa</HI> in <HI>Crim-Tartarie</HI> to <HI>Constantinople.</HI>
For confirmation of which, I one day there saw the
ruins of one of the most deplorable shipwracks that
had happen'd in those parts of a long time.</P>
<P>Several Vessels of different Burden set <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ail from
<HI>Caffa,</HI> to the number of Eighteen, with a good
Wind; but in a short time that pleasant Gale not
able to keep the field, was forc'd to give way to a
<HI>Kara-iel</HI> so rude and boystrous, that hardly the like
had rag'd in those Seas. The miserable Vessels
were now in the midst of those merciless waves,
when this Tempest surpriz'd them, and not
knowing where to cast Anchor, they were forc'd to
quit their helmes, and commit themselves purely
to the compassion of the wind, in expectation of
nothing but Death. In short, the wind having
thus got them within his power, some he brake one
against another, others he dash'd against the
Rocks, so that of all the whole number, only Two
escap'd, which by good fortune arriv'd at <HI>Constan|tinople</HI>
without Sail, Mast, or Rudder, as if the Sea
had only spar'd those two to carry tydings what
was become of the rest.</P>
<P>All the Houses of eight and twenty Towns that
ly upon the <HI>Thracian Bosphorus,</HI> some in <HI>Asia,</HI> some
in <HI>Europe</HI> side, had not Windows sufficient to hold
<PB N="228" REF="142">
the Spectators that throng'd to view the miserable
estate of these shatter'd Vessels, driving along
toward the Haven. Which so mollifi'd the
Beholders hearts, that some made Vows for their
safe arrival in Harbour, others wept, and all
deplor'd their condition till they saw them safe
in the Port.</P>
<P>The Vessels which ly in the Harbour of <HI>Constan|tinople</HI>
fear not so much this <HI>black wind,</HI> from which
they are shelter'd by the Hills of <HI>Pera</HI> and <HI>Tophana,</HI>
as they do <HI>Gun doghisi,</HI> or <HI>Gun batisi ocusguiar,</HI>
that is to say the Eastern and West<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rn Winds,
especially when they blow hard. For then they
knock the Ships one against another, after such a
surly manner, that the Mariners are constrain'd to
a very hard labour, not inconvenient to them|selves
alone; for they must be very drousie that
can sleep in any of the Houses adjoyning to the
Port, by reason of the hideous noise which the
Sea-men make a-board the Ships. There is
nothing to be heard but a confusion of Voices,
which spreading through the streets over all the
Neighbouring Hills, allarm's all the Dogs in the
City, who each putting in for a share to make up
the dismal consort, cause such a dreadful disorder
in the Air, that you would think the dissolution of
Nature were at hand: Enough to terrifie the most
daring resulution, in a person that never had heard
the same before.</P>
<P>Besides these Four Mosquees, there are several
others very considerable, to which they give the
title <HI>Dgiameler,</HI> or <HI>Royal Mosquees,</HI> every one
bearing the Names of those Emperours that built
them; nor are they consecrated by any other
Title than that of their Founder; <HI>Sultan Bajazet,
Sultan Mahomet, Sultan Selim, Sultan Morat Giamisi.</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="142">
But if a Basha were the Founder, they are
distinguish'd by the word that denotes his Em|ployment,
and that other word <HI>Meschit,</HI> and thus
that Mosquee which the <HI>Basha</HI> of <HI>Caramania</HI> Built,
is call'd <HI>Caraman Pacha Meschit.</HI> But the word
<HI>Dgiami</HI> being more honourable, it is given indiffe|rently
to all the <HI>Turkish</HI> Mosquees, so that custom
will rather have it. <HI>Mahomet Pacha Dgiamisi,</HI> than
<HI>Isouf Aga Meschit.</HI></P>
<P>The number of Mosquees is very great over all
<HI>Turkie,</HI> in regard the <HI>Turks</HI> are very punctual in
coming to Prayers at least thrice a day. In the
City of <HI>Constantinople</HI> alone there are reckon'd to
be Four Thousand Nine Hundred Sixty Five. And
a certain <HI>Dervich</HI> told me one day, there were no
less than Fourteen Thousand in all <HI>Turkey;</HI> though
I fear he was out of his tale, if not six, yet five
Thousand at least: They are all kept well in
repair, as being all well endow'd, besides that one
or other Godly Musselman dyes every day, leaving
a pious morsell behind him for his souls benefit.
The usual Foundation-rate for the <HI>Softa</HI> to read
Prayers five or seven times in a day, is Eight or Ten
<HI>Aspers per diem:</HI> He that leaves such a Legacy
does well; others leave so much for the main|tenance
of a Lamp, or so much quarterly to the
Poor; of all which Legacies, the <HI>Kesler Agasi,</HI> or
Superintendent over the Ladies of the <HI>Serraglio,</HI> is
Disposer General, and next to him the <HI>Katib,</HI> or
Curate of the Mosquee.</P>
<P>Now among the great number of those that
repair to the Mosquees, there are some who out of
a desire to be accompted holy, are not content to
abide in the Mosquee all day, but beg to stay there
also all Night long in the exercise of their Devo|tions,
among the rest a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> who was lookt
<PB N="230" REF="143">
upon in the neighborhood where he liv'd as a very
sober religious person, begg'd leave from the
Director of a small Mosquee, that he might some|times
tarry all night to satisfie his devotions. The
Director, who in those little Mosquees is both <HI>Iman,</HI>
Porter and Lamp-lighter, embody'd all in one
Office, willing to gratify the good mans zeal,
granted his request, as often as he desir'd, not
Dreaming that his design was to devour more Oyl
in one than would feed Twenty Lamps in a fcore
of Nights. For he knew him to be a man that
few had observ'd ever to eat but very sparingly,
and therefore judg'd him to be a most sanctify'd
soul. But he was ignorant it seems, that he slept
all day, and took his repasts <HI>gratis</HI> at Night: But
at length, finding that his Oyl wasted at an ungodly
rate, and not knowing whom in the world to
suspect, he order'd one night two of his friends to
watch this same pious <HI>Dervich,</HI> and if they found
him peccant, to strap him wellfavourdly. For he
shrewdly suspected this holy Votary to be the
<HI>Zetiegi</HI> or <HI>Oyl-licker,</HI> and absolutely clear'd the Rats
as innocent of the crime.</P>
<P>To this purpose, the <HI>Iman</HI> having plac'd his
friends in a convenient corner, lock'd the Mosquee
door and went his way. Presently the devout
<HI>Dervich</HI> believing all was safe, drew out his loaf
from his bosome and fell to work, and ever and
anon, as he dipp'd his bread in one of the Lamps
which was full of excellent Oyl, he would thus
reason with his conscience touching the scruples
which it weakly offer'd to defer him from stealing
the joy of his stomach. <HI>Whatever</HI> (said he) <HI>comes
from God is common, this Temple and all that is in it
comes from God; this Oyl comes from God; this bread
comes from God, and I am the servant of God, and
<PB N="231" REF="143">
therefore I may make use of what comes from God,</HI>
and so fell a sopping, like a Rat that dips his tail
in a Sack-but. The <HI>Iman's</HI> two friends having
observ'd him, and mad to see how greedily the
holy <HI>Dervich</HI> lick'd up the sacred Oyl, stole upon
him without being perceiv'd, while he was busie at
his <HI>bou allactan guelur,</HI> which he repeated every
time he sopp'd his bread, and giving him some
half ascore good licks over the shoulders, crying
out at the same time <HI>Bou daha allactan guelur, This
also comes from God,</HI> turned him out of the
Mosquee, where he was never permitted to sop
more.</P>

the <HI>Turks,</HI> and principal Governour of all the
Mosquees, as also chief President of all the <HI>Divans.</HI>
His authority extends over all <HI>Turkie,</HI> as being a
person of great merit and well vers'd in Law; for
which reason he is consulted in all affairs most
knottie and difficult to resolve. The question is
propounded to him in writing, and the business is
determin'd by his <HI>Olur</HI> or <HI>Olmaz, it may,</HI> or <HI>may
not be,</HI> which he subscribes at the bottom of the
<HI>Fetfa,</HI> or demand, with his name, and addition

<P>Next to the <HI>Mufti</HI> is the <HI>Katib</HI> or Curate, who
reads Prayers upon <HI>Fridays</HI> and other Holy-days:
Under him are the <HI>Imans,</HI> of which there are
<PB N="232" REF="144">
several belonging to the Cathedral Mosquees: And
next to them the <HI>Belligler</HI> or Singing men. The
<HI>Ovazes,</HI> or <HI>Nasijetgis,</HI> who are the Preachers, and
mount the Pulpit Three times a week, to instruct
the people in the points of Religion, and what they
ought to believe and do. The <HI>Sokta's</HI> or <HI>Softa's</HI> and
<HI>Mulla's,</HI> who are sort of hirelings, that never say
Prayers but when they are pay'd for it, or else
when they are sent for to sing the praises of the
dead. The <HI>Mucktars</HI> who take care of the Lamps;
the <HI>Klingiler,</HI> who looks after the Carpets; the
<HI>Kaimgiler,</HI> or <HI>Supurgiler,</HI> whose business it is to
clean the Carpets, as also the rest of the Temple.
The <HI>Capigiler</HI> or Porter; the <HI>Muezins</HI> or <HI>Cryers;</HI>
and several sorts of <HI>Derviches, Cheiks,</HI> and <HI>Santons,</HI>
a sort of people that resort to the Mosquees, rather
to share in the Almes, than for any service which
they perform there.</P>
<P>All the Officers are well pay'd, and have good
Salaries, to encourage them to be careful to keep
the Mosquees neat and clean from all manner of
filth and defilement, and more especially to keep
out the Dogs. Only Cats are priviledg'd, as well
to the end they may kill the Mice, which many
times make bold with the Carpets, as for that
they were <HI>Mahomets</HI> good friends, being generally

<HEAD>Of their Hospitals.</HEAD>
<P>YOu may cast into the number of Mosquees,
those other places which the <HI>Turkish</HI> Piety
has Founded in <HI>Constantinople.</HI> For there are in
that City above an hundred considerable <HI>Timar|kana's</HI>
or Hospitals for the infirm and distracted;
and <HI>Takiakana's,</HI> or places to lodge the poor,
where they have every day an allowance of
Bread and Porridge. The <HI>Khans</HI> or <HI>Caravansera's</HI>
are great houses built much like the Colledges in
<HI>Paris,</HI> and founded by rich persons, to lodge
strangers, where they may remain secure, and at
small expences, as long as they please, paying only
one or two <HI>Aspers</HI> a day, which is no more than a
<HI>Sous</HI> at most. There are of these <HI>Karavansera's</HI>
about Four Hundred and Seventeen, with their
Fountains and store-houses, and some have their
Mosquees, and Baths too within themselves.</P>
<P>The strict prohibition of Wine among the
<HI>Turks,</HI> makes them take great care in providing
store of Fountains as well for their Religious as
necessary uses. Insomuch that the number of
Fountains in <HI>Constantinople</HI> and the Suburbs is
reckon'd to amount to Five Thousand Nine
Hundred Thirty Five, as well those belonging to
the Mosquees, as in other parts of the City, from

<HEAD>Of the Divan, or the Turks Courts of Iustice.</HEAD>
<P>AS among all the Nations in the world, it
will be a difficult thing to find any one
that bears a greater reverence to the places ap|pointed
for Divine Worship, than the <HI>Turks,</HI> so
may it likewi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e be as certain that there are
not any people more submissive to the decrees and
sentences that issue out of the <HI>Divan,</HI> in point
of Justice. There is no requiring a second Sum|mons
to cite the party to appear before the
Judge. He that believes himself most guilty,
fears not to go and receive his Sentence, as if
he believ'd the proverb absolutely true, which
sayes, <HI>that the hand cut off by Iustice does no evil.</HI>
Yet does not this proceed from the integrity of
their Judges, nor the equity of their Laws, for
there is nothing more unjust or more Tyrannical,
but it proceeds from the fear of the <HI>Battoon,</HI> and
the cruel Fines which they lay upon people, who
neither dare nor can appeal to any superiour
Justice, which can only be expected by the <HI>Cai|macan</HI>
or <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> himself.</P>
<P>The Court of Justice is call'd the <HI>Divan,</HI> and
there is one at least in every City, how small so
ever it be, where it is kept of due right in the
<HI>Cadi's</HI> house. But where there is a <HI>Basha,</HI> he
does all he can to deprive him of that priviledge,
and to take the Cognizance of all business to him|self.
As for the Constantinopolitan <HI>Divan,</HI> it is
held in the great <HI>Serraglio</HI> four times a week,
<HI>Saturday, Sunday, Munday</HI> and <HI>Thursday.</HI> Upon
<PB N="235" REF="145">
every one of these days, the principal Offic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters">&punc;
that is to say, the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> or in his absence
the <HI>Caimacan,</HI> sits in the middle, the <HI>Nichandgi
Bachi,</HI> or the Keeper of the Seals, upon his right
hand; the <HI>Cadile squiers,</HI> or Superintendents of Justice,
upon his left hand; and the <HI>Defterdars,</HI> or <HI>Protho|notaries,</HI>
some on the one side, some on the other. The
<HI>Capigi Bachi</HI> or chief Porter, and <HI>Chaours Bachi</HI> or
chief Usher, guard the Entrance.</P>
<P>The chief Affairs under the Cognizance of this
Chamber are the publick Revenue, then the Mili|tia,
next the political Government, and distribu|tion
of Justice over the whole <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire.
Then they examine the Negotiations of Em|bassadours,
what they demand, and what answer
to give. Afterwards they make dispatch of
Priviledges, Grants, Passports, Letters to the
absent Basha's, and condemn Criminals, or those
whom they believe to be so, to death. This done,
they hear the business and complaints of particular
persons, doing quick justice, and with a conscio|nable
equity, especially if the Grand Signor be
in Town. For then the Judges are afraid, lest he
should be listning at a certain Window that looks
into the <HI>Divan,</HI> having only a black Cyprus Cur|tain
drawn before it, and being himself a witness
of their injustice, should send for their heads as
soon as they rise from the Tribunal.</P>
<P>It will be needless here to tell you what crimes
deserve burning, what empaling, what hanging,
what merit casting into the Sea, and what
offences are punish'd with drubbing. 'Tis suffi|ciently
known, that all Offenders against Maho|metanism
are only burnt and empal'd; Murder
and Robbery is punish'd with hanging and behea|ding;
Adultresses are thrown into the Sea; but as
<PB N="236" REF="146">
for drubbing every small fault procures it. And
therefore since I can add nothing but what has been
abundantly discours'd already, I shall only relate
a short but pleasant story concerning the Justice
of the <HI>Turks.</HI></P>
<P>It is the custome of the <HI>Turkish</HI> Judges, to cause
the party that brings his cause before them to
swear the truth of the matter alledg'd by laying
his hand upon the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> with this farther pe|nalty,
if what he swears to be true prove false,
he shall be forc'd to part with his Wife to the
Embraces of another, at least for such a time,
which custome is more especially observ'd in <HI>Syria.</HI>
One time while I was at <HI>Antiochia,</HI> a young Mer|chant
of that City, who was lately Marry'd to a
beautiful <HI>Phoenician</HI> Damsel of <HI>Damascus,</HI> whom he
passionately lov'd, had some occasion of suit with
a Merchant of <HI>Aleppo,</HI> at what time to confirm the
justice of his cause, he happen'd to let fall certain
words, <HI>that he wish'd another might enjoy his Wife,
if the thing he had sworn were not true.</HI> Whereupon
the Judge gave judgment in favour of the young
Marry'd Merchant, and condemn'd his Adver|sary.</P>
<P>He understanding well the penalty which the
Law inflicted upon those that swear a false Oath,
would not abide by the first Sentence, but brought
about the business again, in hopes of a revenge, if
he could so order the matter that the young
Merchant might be parted from his Wife, though
it were for no longer than Twenty Four Hours,
long enough a conscience for a man to be fairly
Cornuted. To which purpose he made it his
business to find out some Knight of the Post, to
swear that what his adversary had sworn was
false. This was no difficult thing to obtain, for
<PB N="237" REF="146">
among the <HI>Turks,</HI> there are several who will sell
their consciences at a cheap rate.</P>
<P>Nor was it long before the <HI>Aleppo</HI> Merchant
being furnish'd for his Money, brought Witnesses
to swear according to his mind and direction.
Which being solemnly done, the <HI>Cadi</HI> turns the
scale of Justice, and condemns the amorous <HI>Antio|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">hian</HI>
according to the Law, as a person who not
regarding his word, was unworthy to possess so fair
a Treasure, to lose his Wife, and orders him to
deliver her up to his disposal. The unfortunate
young man, heavily afflicted at the thought of a loss
so insupportable, made his Addresses to a certain
<HI>Cheik,</HI> who had the repute of a very wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e and
learned man, and to whom frequent applications
were made in difficult cases, desiring him to find out
a knack to puzzle the Law. He unfolded his
condition to him, and besought him to invent some
way to mitigate the rigour of the Law, and to
speak to the <HI>Cadi</HI> in his behalf; withal, to Oyl the
wheels of his Invention, he gave the <HI>Cheik</HI> Ten
<HI>Sequins</HI> in hand, to the value of Three and Twenty
<HI>French</HI> Crowns. The <HI>Cheik,</HI> who was no fool, but
a person of a quick wit, and sharp Imagination,
told the young Merchant, that it was an enter|prize
of great difficulty to move against the power
of the Law, however he made no question to find
out some favourable interpretation of it, and so
to order the matter that the <HI>Cadi</HI> should confirm
his exposition, provided he would not be wanting
on his part to prepare the Judge for an Alteration
of his opinion, by anointing the palm of his hand
with a small present of that effectual Balsom
which men call Gold.</P>
<P><HI>The Merchant of</HI> Antiochia, <HI>who would have
parted with all</HI> Syria, <HI>rather than his dear and
<PB N="238" REF="147">
beautiful Wife, was not unmindful of the</HI> Cheik's
<HI>wholsome admonition. So home he went, fetches
Twenty</HI> Sequin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>more, and returnes to his Law-Doctor.
When the</HI> Cheik <HI>beheld the fair Tempta|tion
ready, away he carry's the young afflicted
Lover to the</HI> Cadi, <HI>who having order'd the Client
and his Council admittance,</HI> Sir, <HI>said the</HI> Cheik, you
have given sentence against this person, which I cannot
deny but to be conformable to Law; however, in regard
it is a great affliction to him, and that he is my particu|lar
friend, I come here to beseech ye, that for my sake
you would receive the little small present which he makes
ye, and permit me to construe this Law according to my
slender opinion. The Law is, that whoever he be that
shall swear a false Oath, shall be for ever parted from his
Wife, or at least that another man shall enjoy her for
Twenty Four hours, and ly with her in the presence of
her Husband. I confess, the Law is a good Law, and the
sentence you have given is a just sentence. But, Sir, let me
begg that it may be thus put in execution. The Merchant
Wife shall be parted from him for Twenty Four Hours
as you have determin'd&punc; But he that enjoys her, and
that shall embrace her in the presence of her Husband,
shall be if you are so pleased to decide it, the River that
washes the Walls of <HI>Antiochia,</HI> he has all the qua|lities
which the Law requires, he is call'd <HI>Orontes,</HI> and
is of the Masculine Gender. <HI>The</HI> Cadi <HI>surpriz'd at
the ingenious Evasion which the</HI> Cheik <HI>had found out
to help him to the Twenty</HI> Sequins, <HI>chang'd his
former opinion, and pronounc'd Sentence of Execu|tion
according to the cunning Advocates more gain|ful
intimations, and dismiss'd both Parties out of the

<HEAD>Of the Employments of the Turks.</HEAD>
<P>MAn was born for Action, and those Nations
are most worthy of praise, who best imploy
themselves, and are most in business. True it is,
that the final causes of the <HI>Turkish</HI> industry, are the
same with those of all other people, necessity, profit,
and pleasure; but in regard they are contented
with very little, therefore they are not much per|plex'd
with an eager thirst after wealth, not think
it worth the breaking their Brains in the study
of Arts and Sciences. So that it is no wonder if
you meet among them, with no more than what is
absolutely necessary for humane being; indis|pensable
in the course of Trade, or but meanly
assistant to the divertisements of the Mind, or
recreations of the Body, or to pass away the
time, which always grows tedious to persons so
lumpish and so little studious as the Mahometans.</P>
<P>Those Employments to which necessity con|strains
the <HI>Turks</HI> are Agriculture, Baking, dressing
Victuals, and Building. As to the first, the Chri|stians
are only they that Till the Earth over all the
<HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire. The <HI>Turks</HI> never put their hands
to the Plough, unless extremity constrain them;
for there must be neither Christians nor <HI>Armenians</HI>
in that Village, where the <HI>Turks</HI> trouble their
heads either with Sowing or Reaping. As to the
second, there are in <HI>Constantinople</HI> not above seven
Hundred Bakers that keep publick Ovens, where
those that make their bread themselves may carry
their dough to have it bak'd. These <HI>Bakers,</HI> whom
they call <HI>Ecmekgiler,</HI> generally keep a Mill in their
own houses, which Mills, to the number of Six
<PB N="240" REF="148">
Hundred, are turn'd by several sorts of beasts,
according as they are in bigness. There are nei|ther
Water nor Windmills belonging to the City,
nor to any of the adjacent parts. Neither is
their bread well tast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d nor good for any thing, but
when it is hot, or only of one days baking; for
it being made up in flat round Cakes, presently
grows hard and dry.</P>
<P>Their Cookery is much like that in the Kitchen
of <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, who refus'd the Cooks
which the Queen of <HI>Caria</HI> sent him, saying, that his
Governour <HI>Leonidas</HI> had left him two, the best in
the world at making Sawces to quick'n the Appe|tite,
that is to say, stirring in a Morning to sharpen
the stomach against Dinner, and Evening exercise
to beget an Appetite for Supper; and indeed those
are the best sawces to make a man relish the Maho|metan
Ragou's. <HI>Pilaw,</HI> or Rice boyl'd in the
Broath of flesh, or else with Water and Butter, is
one of their choicest dainties, and without which
the greatest feast in the world would signifie little.
With this they frequently mix a sort of curdled
Milk, which they call <HI>Ioghourt,</HI> Saffron to colour
it, Honey or <HI>Pekmes</HI> to sweeten it, and several
other Ingredients, such as the fantasticalness of a
deprav'd relish dictates to their humour. Their
Roastmeats, which they call <HI>Kiabab,</HI> of which they
seldome make use, are neither larded nor stuff'd,
unless it be with the fat of huge <HI>Caramania</HI> Mutton,
and little better tasted than their Boyl'd; and then
lastly, in regard the pleasure of Prohibited Wine
never keeps them long carowsing after meals,
they have snapp'd up their Dinners and folded up
their <HI>Sofra</HI> or Napkin, before a <HI>French</HI> man has
supp'd up his first mess of Pottage; a thing which
the <HI>Turks</HI> never heard talk of.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="148">
This temperance, which would never agree
with a <HI>German's</HI> or a <HI>French</HI>-mans stomach, is of
great advantage to the <HI>Turks,</HI> especially in War.
For they never burden their Camp with any
other provisions, than Rice, Butter, or some few
dry'd Fruits, nor carry along with them an un|profitable
train of people, to provide and dress
a Hundred varieties of dishes; nor are their Sol|diers
put to it, to hazard their lives, by straying
from their Body, in search of dainties to satisfy
their intemperance: And at home, a Tun of Rice,
with a small quantity of Butter, and dry'd fruits,
will serve a numerous family for a whole Twelve-month.
For my part I cannot attribute the strength
and plumpness of the <HI>Levantines</HI> to any other cause
than to their temperance. So that were they per|mitted
to enjoy large possessions of their own, and
to receive the Rents of them to their own use,
that sparing course of life would enrich more
Families in a year, than the Kitchen-expences of
<HI>France</HI> have ruin'd Families in that Kingdome in
several. For the Kitchen in a House, is like the
spleen in a mans body, the larger it grows, the
more it occasions the rest of the Vitals to dwindle
away.</P>
<P>I must confess, in favour of <HI>Galen,</HI> that the
greatest part of the Eastern people, especially the
Merchants, Handicraft-Tradesmen, Travellers,
and such like, eat little at Dinner, but make their
full meals at supper, contrary to the custome of the
<HI>Europeans,</HI> who according to the precepts of the
<HI>Salern</HI> School, follow the advice of <HI>Hippocrates.</HI>
But notwithstanding this dispute between the Two
Princes of the Faculty of Physick, Custome (which
is a second Nature) is the best arbitrator of this
difference. However, to say no more of the <HI>Turkish</HI>
<PB N="242" REF="149">
Cookery, I cannot forbear at <HI>Paris</HI> to entertain
my friends now and then with a dish of <HI>Pilaw,
Doulma, Bourek, Chorba,</HI> and other <HI>Eastern Ragous,</HI>
to shew that I have dieted with all the <HI>Eastern</HI>
people.</P>
<P>Now as for their Architecture, if they have any
certain Rules among themselves, they never make
use of them for their private edifices. There are
none but their publick structures, as <HI>Mosquees,
Baths, Hospitals, Caravansera's, Basars,</HI> and <HI>Bese|stins,</HI>
which have anything passable to commend
their Art. For in their other private Buildings
you shall hardly meet with any thing, but only
some Rooms Wainscoted, gilt and fretwork'd, and
those also but very few, and without any other
furniture than <HI>Sopha,</HI> spread with its Minders and
Coverlets. So that whoever considers the <HI>Turks</HI>
frugal manner of living, will easily believe their
grand Design to be rather the enlargment of
their Dominions, than to establish the prosperity
of what they have won already. So vain a thing
it is, among them to seek for Amphitheaters,
Paintings, Sculptures, or any other rarities, which
are the products of noble Arts. They are the sworn
enemies of ingenuity, not having any thing among
them, but what their own natural stupidity prompts
them to, for the meer support of humane life:
So far are they from the ancient quaintness and in|genuity
of the sedulous. <HI>Egyptians, Arabians,</HI> and
<HI>Greeks,</HI> whose Territories they now Lord over,
tyrannizing over their posterity with so much
cruelty, that they will not suffer them to improve
those Arts or Sciences among themselves, which
their Ancestors first found out, nor to make use of
that knowledge which they have gain'd elsewhere,
though in the practice of Physic, which they so
<PB N="243" REF="149">
much admire. So that should an <HI>Akin</HI> or Physician
but attempt the Anatomie or dissection of any
Creature, for the discovery of some new benefit to
Mankind, he might assure himself, notwithstanding
the respect they bear to his profession, of such an
unreasonable amercement, as would consume in
one day, the gains of all his life before.</P>
<P>But I must forbear to speak any more in the
dispraise of this Barbarous people, lest they should
revenge themselves upon me with Interest when
they find me next in their clutches, especially being
upon the point of undertaking another Voyage to
the same places, that nothing may escape me which is
worthy observation in those parts. I shall therefore
conclude with my Prayers to the supream Lord of
all things, that he would be pleas'd to inspire the
most puissant Monarch in the Universe, with a
design, which would not fail of success, under the
conduct of his Piety, and supported by the Valour
of a Prince who justly merits the Title of most
<HI>Christian King,</HI> and happily Victorious.</P>
