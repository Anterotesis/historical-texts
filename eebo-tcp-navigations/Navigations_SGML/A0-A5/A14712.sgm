<L>WHen as in faire <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI></L>
<L>our Saviour Chri&s;t did live,</L>
<L>And for the &s;ins of all the world,</L>
<L>his owne deare life did give;</L>
<L>The wicked <HI>Jewes</HI> with &s;coffs and &s;cornes</L>
<L>did daily him mole&s;t,</L>
<L>That never till he left his life,</L>
<L>our Saviour could have re&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When they had crown'd his head with thorns,</L>
<L>and &s;courg'd him in di&s;grace,</L>
<L>In &s;cornfull &s;ort they led him forth</L>
<L>unto his dying place,</L>
<L>Where thou&s;and thou&s;ands in the &s;treet</L>
<L>be held him pa&s;&s;e along,</L>
<L>Yet not one gentle heart was there</L>
<L>that pittied thus his wrong.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Both old and young reviled him,</L>
<L>as in the &s;treets he went,</L>
<L>And nothing found but churli&s;h taunts,</L>
<L>by every ones con&s;ent:</L>
<L>His owne dear Cro&s;&s;e he bore him&s;elfe,</L>
<L>a burthen far too great,</L>
<L>Which made him in the &s;treets to faint,</L>
<L>and blood and water &s;weat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Being weary, thus he &s;ought to re&s;t</L>
<L>and ea&s;e his burthen'd Soule</L>
<L>Vpon a &s;tone, the which a wretch</L>
<L>did churli&s;hly controule;</L>
<L>And &s;aid, away thou King of <HI>Jewes,</HI></L>
<L>thou &s;halt not re&s;t thee here,</L>
<L>Pa&s;&s;e on, thy execution place</L>
<L>thou &s;ee'&s;t now draweth n&eacute;ere.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And hereupon he thru&s;t him thence,</L>
<L>at which our Saviour &s;aid</L>
<L>I &s;ure will re&s;t, but thou &s;halt walke,</L>
<L>and have no journey &s;taid:</L>
<L>With that this cur&s;ed Shoomaker,</L>
<L>for offering Chri&s;t this wrong.</L>
<L>Left Wife and Children hou&s;e and all,</L>
<L>and went from thence along.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where after he had &s;eene the blood</L>
<L>of Ie&s;us Chri&s;t thus &s;hed,</L>
<L>And to the Cro&s;&s;e his body nayld,</L>
<L>away with &s;peed he fled,</L>
<L>Without returning back againe</L>
<L>unto his dwelling place,</L>
<L>But wandering up and downe the world,</L>

<L>NO re&s;ting could he find at all,</L>
<L>no ea&s;e of hearts content,</L>
<L>No hou&s;e, no home nor byding place,</L>
<L>but wandring forth he went,</L>
<L>From Town to Town in forraign Lands</L>
<L>with grieved Con&s;cience &s;till,</L>
<L>Repenting &s;ore the hainous guilt</L>
<L>of his fore-pa&s;&s;ed ill.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus after &s;ome few Ages pa&s;t,</L>
<L>in wandring up and downe,</L>
<L>He much againe de&s;ir'd to &s;&eacute;e</L>
<L><HI>Jeru&s;alems</HI> renowne:</L>
<L>But finding it all quite de&s;troy'd,</L>
<L>he wandred thence with woe,</L>
<L>Our Saviours words which he had &s;poke</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ile re&s;t (&s;aith he) but thou &s;halt walke,</L>
<L>&s;o doth this wandring <HI>Jew</HI></L>
<L>From place to place, but cannot &s;tay,</L>
<L>for &s;eeking Countries new:</L>
<L>Declaring &s;till the power of him,</L>
<L>whereas he comes and goes,</L>
<L>And of all things done in the Ea&s;t</L>
<L>&s;ince Chri&s;t his death, he &s;howes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The world he hath halfe compa&s;t round,</L>
<L>and &s;&eacute;ene tho&s;e Nations &s;trange,</L>
<L>That hearing of the Name of Chri&s;t,</L>
<L>their Idoll gods doe change:</L>
<L>To whom he hath told wondrous things,</L>
<L>of times fore-pa&s;t and gone,</L>
<L>And to the Princes of the world</L>
<L>declares his cau&s;e of mone;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>De&s;iring &s;till to be di&s;&s;olv'd,</L>
<L>and yeeld his mortall breath:</L>
<L>But yet the Lord hath thus decr&eacute;ed,</L>
<L>he &s;hall not yet &s;&eacute;e death;</L>
<L>For neither lookes be old or young,</L>
<L>but as he did tho&s;e times</L>
<L>When Chri&s;t did &s;uffer on the Cro&s;&s;e</L>
<L>for mortall &s;inners Crimes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He pa&s;&s;ed many a forraigne place,</L>
<L><HI>Arabia, Aegypt, Africa,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Grecia, Syria,</HI> and great <HI>Thrace,</HI></L>
<L>and through all <HI>Hungaria:</HI></L>
<L>Where <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> preached Chri&s;t,</L>

<L>Where he hath told our Saviours words</L>
<L>in Countries farre and neere.</L>

<LG>
<L>And lately in <HI>Bohemia.</HI></L>
<L>with many a <HI>German</HI> Towne,</L>
<L>And now in <HI>Flanders,</HI> as is thought,</L>
<L>he wandreth up and downe:</L>
<L>Where learned men with him confers,</L>
<L>of the&s;e his lingring dayes</L>
<L>And wondring much, to heare him tell</L>
<L>his journeys and his wayes.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If people giveth this <HI>Jew</HI> an Almes,</L>
<L>the mo&s;t that he will take</L>
<L>Is not above a Great a time,</L>
<L>which be for Ie&s;us &s;ake</L>
<L>Will kindly give unto the poore,</L>
<L>and thereof make no &s;pare,</L>
<L>Affirming &s;till, that Ie&s;us Chri&s;t</L>
<L>of him hath dayly care.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He nere was &s;&eacute;ene to laugh nor &s;mile,</L>
<L>but w&eacute;epe and make great mone,</L>
<L>Lamenting &s;till his mi&s;eries,</L>
<L>and dayes fore-pa&s;t and gone.</L>
<L>If he heard any one bla&s;pheme,</L>
<L>and take Gods Name in vaine,</L>
<L>He tells them that they crucifie</L>

<LG>
<L>If you had &s;&eacute;ene him dye, &s;ayes he,</L>
<L>as the&s;e mine eyes have done,</L>
<L>Ten thou&s;and times a day would ye</L>
<L>his torments thinke upon,</L>
<L>And &s;uffer for his &s;ake all paine,</L>
<L>all torments, and all woes;</L>
<L>The&s;e are his words, and this his life,</L>
