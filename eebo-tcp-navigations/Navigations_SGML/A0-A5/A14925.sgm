<HEAD>A TRVE COPPIE OF A LETTER Sent from Doctor <HI>Welles, Relating all &s;uch Occurrences, as</HI> haue hapned in the PALATINATE of Late.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Received this 10. of <HI>Iune.</HI> 1622.</HEAD>
<P>_I Doe not write this Letter with any de&s;ire of publication, becau&s;e the be&s;t Compo&s;iters are &s;ubiect to the wor&s;t cen&s;ures, or willing|ne&s;&s;e to traduce, and countermand &s;uch Pam|phlets, as are rather framed out of coniecturall braynes then hone&s;t intelligence, but meerely to &s;atisfie my Friends, e&s;pecially &s;uch as are
<PB N="2" REF="3">friends of the cau&s;e of the <HI>Pallatinate,</HI> and finde their hearts affected to the true vnder&s;tanding of the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e. For if in &s;upplying the Pre&s;&s;e there is a kind of commenditory zeale and hone&s;t wellwi&s;hing manife&s;ted; much more &s;hall the truth it &s;elfe receiue grace and favour, and be well come to all Religious hearts; as for &s;uch as are otherwi&s;e addicted, it matters not to &s;atisfie them, for <HI>Charmes</HI> will not moue <HI>Adders</HI> out of their holes. And <HI>Pharoahs</HI> heart was hardned, till he &s;aw the judgements of God. To conclude this Preface, if you meane to divulge any thing I write, I pray you giue the world notice, that it is again&s;t my will; and Letters written in ha&s;t are not fit for curious over-looking, or judicious exa|mination. As for extractions, and culling out (as I may &s;ay) the principall poynts, it will be the better, if there be way giuen, whereby the Worke may be iu&s;tifiable, and the world made acquainted with information of the Truth; and &s;o to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Since the Kings comming into the <HI>Pallatinate,</HI> and ioyning with Count <HI>Mansfeild,</HI> there hath beene many skirmi&s;hes, I will not call them all Battailes, in all which it hath plea&s;ed God
<PB N="3" REF="3">to giue him happie &s;ucce&s;&s;e, yea, in that vn|fortunate Di&s;a&s;ter of the Powder, in the Mar|quis of <HI>Badens</HI> Campe, the i&s;&s;ue tended to the glory of God, and the Kings eternall Honour, for he recovered more then he lo&s;t, and gaue them all a worthy te&s;timony of his valour and Horoick Demeanor, &s;o that if you will giue me leaue by way of Tran&s;ci|&s;ion, to exemplifie &s;ome particulars, and I will by Gods grace &s;peake nothing but the Truth, and &s;o dull and abate all the &s;harpe and keene edges again&s;t Him, which de&s;ire to cut the life of Reputation, did not Vertue in de&s;pight, like a Sunne di&s;pelling the va|pours, quite di&s;&s;olue and vani&s;h the mor|ning dew of calumniation.</P>
<P>Know then, that in the&s;e Conflicts, his Maie&s;tie hath &s;till beene in per&s;on, and &s;o forward, that he hath many times &s;hewed &s;ufficient te&s;timonie of his owne particular valour, di&s;charging his Pi&s;toll at the very fir&s;t Encounter, in the face of the Enemie; and many times Adventuring with the formo&s;t, when there was great rea&s;on and cau&s;e that he &s;hould haue beene more charie of his per|&s;on. Be&s;ides, He is a comely and hand&s;ome
<PB N="4" REF="4">Gentleman, and &s;o compleat, that I know not whither I &s;hould preferre the workman|&s;hip of God, in his compo&s;ure of bodie, or well qualifying his minde, for he is and ever hath beene, for any thing I can heare or &s;ee, of extraordinary good Demeanor in all his affayres, as both his &s;peeches and actions doe manife&s;t, neither deiected with Adver|&s;itie, nor lifted vp with Pro&s;peritie. Fayre and temperate, neither giuen to the common vice of the Dutch Nation, which is drunkenne&s;&s;e, nor yet the Engli&s;h, although he haue well learned the Engli&s;h Tongue, wherewith the mo&s;t doe learne the Engli&s;h Oathes: He is &s;o moderately conditioned, that there is a plea|&s;ure to behold Him, and a delight to con|ver&s;e with Him; the truth is, I never heard his worth &s;ufficiently &s;poken of before his comming to vs, &s;o can I not &s;ufficiently de|mon&s;trate the &s;ame, now he is among&s;t vs. I haue inci&s;ted the longer vpon this my poore Di&s;covery, becau&s;e Malice heretofore hath imputed the lo&s;&s;e of <HI>Prague</HI> to his negligence, or ignorance; and wickedne&s;&s;e, even at this pre&s;ent, doth dare to lay &s;ome a&s;per&s;ions vpon Him: But to goe forward.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P> After the recouery of the <HI>Marque&s;&s;e</HI> of <HI>Baden,</HI> and the taking of <HI>Laden-burge,</HI> there|was a worke to take out the proui&s;ion there|in, and bring it to the Kings &s;tore at <HI>Main|hem.</HI> For it was great and much more then was expected, &s;o that the whole Army was the better refre&s;hed: after which another buy &s;ine&s;&s;e of great importance propo&s;ed it &s;elfe, and the Kings Army in as great &s;pee|dine&s;&s;e marched ouer the <HI>Rheine</HI> at <HI>Mantem</HI> bridge towards <HI>Haggenaw</HI> in <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> before which <HI>Leopoldus</HI> the Emperors brother had lyen &s;ome ten dayes, as re&s;olued to &s;urpri&s;e and be&s;iege the &s;ame by way of recouerie of &s;ome of his lo&s;&s;es: but hearing of the Kings approch, and fearing the &s;ally of the towne, which was extraordinary manned with 5000 of <HI>Mansfields</HI> &s;ouldiers, he pre|pared to draw a way about the 8 of May by your account, and tooke an order with his army to &s;hift for them&s;elues, as he very fortunately made his owne e&s;cape: but the Kings army followed him &s;o clo&s;e, and pur|&s;ued him &s;o farre, that they cut off mo&s;t of his baggage, and &s;eized on his carriages, where contrary to expectation was found
<PB N="6" REF="5">aboue 26000. l. weight of pouder, all his plate and much good furniture be&s;ides, ere they ended the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, both Colonell and Captaine, with a regiment of foote and &s;ix troupes of hor&s;e, were mo&s;t of them ta|ken, and reduced to his Maie&s;ties &s;eruice, for very few vvere &s;laine at this time: this was done when they were pa&s;&s;ing a bridge, vvhich as &s;ome &s;ay vvas broken, and others &s;ay was ouerthronged with numbers; but the former is likelie&s;t, becau&s;e two peeces of ordnance was drowned, and the King tooke two or three more; but how euer it was, or that men may vary in &s;ome pettie circum&s;tances, vve repute it a greater de|feate then that which they &s;peake of, that the Marquis of <HI>Durlach</HI> had, for though he lo&s;t more ordnance, yet not halfe &s;o many men: be&s;ides, that lo&s;&s;e is doubled by &s;o many troupes as are gone ouer to our &s;ide, and God be prai&s;ed are mo&s;t willing to &s;erue his Maie&s;tie. This, as we heare, is al|ready printed among&s;t you, but in a rouing manner, and farre from &s;ufficient intelli|gence;
<PB N="7" REF="5">and therefore I thought it good, as in the re&s;t, to certifie you in the very truth, which how&s;oeuer many men may &s;up|po&s;e &s;uperfluous, and that &s;till they heare but one and the &s;ame thing, yet &s;ure there is great contentment in ho|ne&s;t confirmation of &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, or true relating the matter. So I go for|ward.</P>
<P>The &s;aid Marquis of <HI>Durlach</HI> named in your copies the Marquis of <HI>Baden,</HI> is againe on foote, and hath altered the manner of his &s;eque&s;tring him&s;elfe in a campe alone, &s;o that now being &s;euen thou&s;and foote and 1200 hor&s;e, as vve may &s;ay, he is ioy|ned vvith the King and Count <HI>Mansfield,</HI> being all together, to abate a little the la|ui&s;hes of rumour 20000 in a running ar|mie, which is continually on foote, as the cau&s;e requireth, and bu&s;ine&s;&s;e im|porteth; for of late they haue beene &s;e|uen dayes together in the Countrey of <HI>Derm&s;trat,</HI> hard by <HI>Frankford,</HI> the Prince whereof <HI>Lantgraue Lodowick</HI> hath alwayes
<PB N="8" REF="6">bin a &s;traight enemy to our affaires, and a publick profe&s;&s;ed friend to his Imperial Ma|ie&s;tie: for it was he that the la&s;t yeare la|boured the accord between the Princes of the Vnion and Marquis <HI>Spinola,</HI> it was he that gaue way and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to all the Spa|ni&s;h marches, it was he that hath &s;o much extolled and magnified the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> it was he that hath taken great paines all this Winter to di&s;&s;wade the Marquis of <HI>Durlach</HI> and other Princes from taking vp armes in our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, vnder pretence of de&s;ire of peace, and auoiding effu&s;ion of Chri&s;tian blood: it was he that gaue eare to the Ie&s;uites and Prie&s;ts in their bla&s;phemous railings and filthy calumniations again&s;t God, his Church, and the King of <HI>Bohemiaes</HI> bu&s;ine&s;&s;e. To conclude, it was he (Gods holy name be prai&s;ed) that the King tooke pri&s;o|ner in his owne country, and keeps him &s;till in his cu&s;tody. His country hath neither &s;trong townes nor fortifications, but is &s;oon &s;ubiect to a violent enforcement, and &s;o was as &s;oone ouercome by our armies affoording a great &s;upply of proui&s;ion, the hungry &s;oul|dier was wel cheered, and our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed gar|ri&s;ons
<PB N="9" REF="6">wonderfully relieued with good mut|tons and beeues, that all this Winter haue bin afflicted with great &s;carcitie and wants, hunger and cold: but now there is a new face of comfort and contentment appeareth on euery &s;ide. For my Lord <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> is &s;afe|ly and opportunely ariued at <HI>Manheim,</HI> to our hearts reioycing and the Kings &s;atisfac|tion. For although <HI>Mon&s;ieur Tilly</HI> our grand enemy be againe &s;trengthened from <HI>Bohe|mia, Bauaria,</HI> and <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> yet whether war or peace, the King is able to en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter">ounter with him, and prepareth with re&s;olution to op|po&s;e all his enemies, let them increa&s;e neuer &s;o fa&s;t, as I mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e they are many; <HI>Tilly</HI> of him&s;elfe is e&s;teemed 14000 &s;trong, and as our intelligence is, hath 6000 more from the Duke of <HI>Bauaria</HI> in his pa&s;&s;ages and <HI>Gon &s;aloes</HI> as he ca~ &s;pare from his gari&s;ons, &s;o that in the end of May he marched full 20000. towards the King, who&s;e tran&s;cendent name with me is predominant.</P>
<P>After my Lord of <HI>Belfa&s;t</HI> or <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> was welcomed and entertained of all &s;ides, the King and Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> departed to the army, and as we had certaine intelligence
<PB N="10" REF="7">vpon Munday the 27 of May he marched to a towne of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ments</HI> aboue <HI>Frankford,</HI> called <HI>Ausburge,</HI> to meete with the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> there, vvho vvas now marching into <HI>Franconia;</HI> but before he could get to the Maine, a riuer ouer vvhich he mu&s;t be tran&s;ported, Generall <HI>Tilly</HI> vvith his great &s;trength and vvhole army vvas got before him, &s;o that he mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;itie fight or retire, for <HI>Brun&s;wick</HI> vvas not yet come vp to the riuer, nor had any notice of the Kings being &s;o neare, more then that he vvould come to meete him.</P>
<P>In breife, to fight vpon &s;o great di&s;advan|tages, was not thought conuenient. For the Countrey being &s;poyled, and vittailes &s;carce could afford them no releife: the enemy be|ing &s;trong and prouided of purpo&s;e, might hazard the Army. For you mu&s;t con&s;ider, be&s;ides <HI>Tillyes</HI> owne forces, he had <HI>Gen&s;alers</HI> hor&s;e which came to him from Openham, from the Archduches hor&s;e, &s;o extraordina|rily armed; that they exceeded the Dutch far and may well be compared to tho&s;e &s;trong
<PB N="11" REF="7">Cataphracts of the <HI>Romaines,</HI> which were armed from head to foote; therefore it was thought conuenient to make a Retreate, which was done in &s;o good order, that to his euerla&s;ting pray&s;e, the King mu&s;t be re|membred: for not with &s;tanding, all they could doe, the enemy followed &s;o hard that he ouer tooke them, and the hor&s;e gort &s;uch way through &amp; about the woods that skir|mi&s;h they mu&s;t, and skirmi&s;h they did, &s;o that the King returned from the Van, to be an actor in the &s;ame.</P>
<P>This fight la&s;ted in a maner two dayes, May 30. 31. and was at la&s;t ended &s;o well, that while the Hor&s;e encountred on both &s;ides: the foote retreated towards <HI>Manheym,</HI> wherein was lo&s;t not aboue on 100. of ei|ther &s;ide, but the Hor&s;e had a &s;orer conflict and a &s;orer continuance, wherein the King as he had done in his fir&s;t battaile with Ge|nerall <HI>Tilly,</HI> demeaned him&s;elfe &s;o couragi|ou&s;ly well, that his example drew on others to noble performances and remarkable en|counters: for among&s;t many Gent. who&s;e names did not at this time fall to my
<PB N="12" REF="8">proportion of knowledge, among tho&s;e that were noted to fight mo&s;t brauely were Colonell <HI>Ouertront</HI> Commander of the <HI>Pal&s;|graues</HI> hor&s;e, one Sir <HI>Iohn Maynard</HI> of <HI>Kent</HI> Captaine of a troupe of Count <HI>Mansfields</HI> hor&s;e, were worthy and remarkable. Count <HI>Mansfield</HI> had one of his kin&s;men, called Count <HI>Philip,</HI> of <HI>Mansfield</HI> taken pri&s;oner, as ouercharged with numbers; diuers others might be reme~bred to their perpetuall fame. Many were &s;lain, wounded, and taken pri&s;o|ners on both &s;ides. The report goeth, y^e lo&s;&s;e was 200 on both &s;ides, the lo&s;&s;e being equal keepeth rumor from too laui&s;h boa&s;ting of peuailing, only the King returning to <HI>Man|heim</HI> that might be &s;aid he was glad it was no wor&s;e, con&s;idering the accident or chance of warre. God had dealt mercifully with him in affoording him &s;o good an e&s;|cape and deliuerance from &s;uch eminent perill.</P>
<P>On our &s;ide was Colonell <HI>Gal&s;tein</HI> Ge|nerall of the Marquis of <HI>Durlacks</HI> hor&s;e &s;laine, a vvorthy braue &s;ouldier, and a Rinegraue taken pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>On the Emperours part a Collonell
<PB N="13" REF="8">in compleate armour, was &s;hot into the face, as he lifted vp his beauer to take the ayre: and &s;undry other officers were &s;ub|iect to the ouer-ma&s;tering forces of their Aduer&s;aries; &s;ome killed, &s;ome wounded, &s;ome &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and they were glad at the la&s;t to part vpon equall termes; and (as we heare) Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tilly</HI> had no great cau&s;e too much to reioyce: for the hor&s;e that e&s;caped left much Armour, and the men were bru&s;ed exceedingly. But con|cerning our &s;elues we e&s;teemed it a ble&s;|&s;ing, exceeding Report, that in a retreite of thirty or forty miles wee haue lo&s;t no baggage at all, nor more men than the enemy, although their ioy exceeded, and Report had made the matter amonge&s;t the Bi&s;hops &s;o famous; yet there is but one trueth, and as neare as euer I can, you haue it: and therefore &s;pare not to tell to both your friends and foes, that our bu&s;ine&s;&s;e doth thriue well, and by Gods gracious a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we &s;hall make a happy progre&s;&s;ion, though I mu&s;t con|fe&s;&s;e, the enemy is very &s;trong, and loo|keth
<PB N="14" REF="9">for great &s;upplies from out of diuers Countries.</P>
<P>The &s;ame night his Maie&s;tie retur|ned to <HI>Maynheim,</HI> and &s;upped cheareful|ly with Generall <HI>Vere;</HI> a&s;&s;uring that the Duke of <HI>Brun&s;wicke</HI> is twenty thou&s;and &s;trong, and encrea&s;eth his Army daily in his marches. Now if any aske where were the skouts on al &s;ides, where was the mi&s;taking, either of the <HI>Rendezuous,</HI> or the day of <HI>Brun&s;wickes</HI> approaches? where was the ouer-&s;ight that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tilly</HI> did lodge him&s;elfe without any feare (as it were) betweene the Armies? for if <HI>Brun&s;wicke</HI> had come forward, how could a dangerous battel haue beene pre|uented? I an&s;were for all as well as my poore vnder&s;tanding will &s;erue me, the&s;e things might bee without impeachment of martiall Policies, or true Di&s;cipline. For, concerning the King of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> he was re&s;olued to fight, and carele&s;&s;e of any forces his enemy could haue, &s;o far forth as he might ioyne with <HI>Brun&s;wicke,</HI> who had formerly &s;ent him Letters of
<PB N="15" REF="9">a&s;&s;urance, hee would come to the riuer of <HI>Mayne</HI> &s;uch a day. Be&s;ides, it was a probable coniecture, that <HI>Tilly</HI> could not &s;o &s;odainly be &s;o &s;trong, con&s;idering his former defeature, and <HI>Leopoldus</HI> ray|&s;ing his Campe; but the truth is, mo&s;t of the Arch-duke <HI>Leopoldus</HI> forces meant directly to ioyne with <HI>Tilly:</HI> and hee tooke aduice with <HI>Gon&s;ales de Cordua</HI> with what expedition to goe forward: Con|cerning <HI>Tilly</HI> him&s;elfe, hee had rea&s;on to preuent the mi&s;chiefes, apprehending an irrecouerable danger, if the King of <HI>Bo|hemia</HI> and <HI>Brun&s;wicke</HI> did meete: be&s;ides, he tooke notice that <HI>Brun&s;wicke</HI> and more Carriages and ordnance mounted which mu&s;t be the cau&s;e of &s;lowe marches, and bring along with him &s;ome impedime~ts: la&s;t of all, that hee mu&s;t pa&s;&s;e ouer the Riuer, and whether by boate or bridge, if hee could get thither afore him, hee was &s;ure to hinder his landing, and pro|cra&s;tinate his iourny. Concerning <HI>Brun&s;|wicke,</HI> he could not be &s;o confident to li|mit his time to a certaine day, becau&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="10">an army in long marches are many times pulled backe from &s;peed and celerity by circum&s;tances, accidents and ca&s;uall e|uents, as hath formerly beene apparent in memorable Expeditions, where the breaking of a carriage, or the di&s;moun|ting of a Cannon hath hindered an Ar|my from a whole dayes march. To con|clude, let there be no impeachment of a Souldiers credite in the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of the warre, except apparent cowardice, follie and trea&s;on &s;teppe in; but let euery man endeauour to do his be&s;t, and when di&s;a|&s;ters happen, be ready rather ab&s;olutely to &s;ay, It was the will and plea&s;ure of God; or with mode&s;ty to conclude as the common Prouerb is, It was the for|tune of warre.</P>
<P>Thus farre haue my Letters extended in the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of the Pallatinate, and if you long now to heare of the King and <HI>Brun&s;wickes</HI> meeting, or of <HI>Mansfields</HI> forward marching, I a&s;&s;ure you I long as much to giue you notice of the &s;ame
<PB N="17" REF="10">and make no que&s;tion, but my next Let|ters &s;hall not only aduerti&s;e you how my Lord of <HI>Bel&s;aft</HI> or <HI>Chiche&s;ter</HI> proceedes in his Commi&s;&s;ion, but &s;end you the hap|py tydings of &s;ome worthy exployt or o|ther, eyther tending to the di&s;charging the Pallatinate of her intollerable bur|thens and grieuous enemies or the thri|ving of the cau&s;e in a farre better manner than many hollow-hearted would haue it, but becau&s;e things are dubitable, and the &s;ecrets which belong to God vn&s;ear|chable, I leaue it to his direction and pre&s;eruation that knoweth what is be&s;t for his owne glory, and the propagation of true Religion. Iu&s;t now as I am rea|dy to &s;eale vp my Letter, comes a Letter from Collonell <HI>Gol&s;teme</HI> his owne hand, whom we tooke to haue been &s;laine, that hee is yet liuing a pri&s;oner, which made much ioy.</P>
