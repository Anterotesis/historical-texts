<HEAD>A LETTER FROM <HI>PLYMO&V;TH, Dated the</HI> 10^t^h <HI>day of</HI> May 1650.</HEAD>
<P>HE that by him&s;elf or by any other, begin|neth any dangerous enterpri&s;e without fore&s;eeing the end and I&s;&s;ue thereof, brin|geth him&s;elf and others into peril; This hath been a received maxim, and newly verified by the late overthrow given to the forces lately landed in <HI>Scotland,</HI> (reported to be of <HI>Montro&s;ses</HI> party, con|&s;i&s;ting chiefly of <HI>Sweads</HI> and <HI>Danes</HI>) of which their is intelligence come hither this day, that they have re|ceived a great overthrow, by a party of Lieut. Gen. <HI>David Le&s;tlies,</HI> who (&s;aith &s;ome Letters) have rou|ted, killed and taken at lea&s;t three thou&s;and, among&s;t whom <HI>Hurry</HI> him&s;elf, is reported to be one of the Pri&s;oners taken, and others of great quality; which comming from &s;uch hands, as we have no cau&s;e to que&s;tion the truth thereof, puts me in mind of an old Proverb, <HI>viz. That they which take upon them more then of right belongeth, commiteth a great error, and &s;el|dom e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed.</HI></P>
<PB N="2" REF="3">
<P>Foure <HI>Straights</HI> Ships are come into this Harbor, (be&s;ides two <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ships hereafter mentioned) the Seamen report that many <HI>Pyrats</HI> infe&s;t the narrow Seas: the clearing of the Coa&s;ts of &s;uch implacable E|nemies, would be a great incouragement to <HI>Merchants,</HI> and therefore we are very joyful to hear that there is a gallant Fleet prepared by the <HI>Parliament,</HI> and as we are informed, is already fallen into the <HI>Downes,</HI> the knowledge whereof, &s;trikes a terror into the Enemy, who having per&s;i&s;ted in their ob&s;tinacy, de&s;erve not the lea&s;t favour; for how can it be &s;afe for the <HI>Com|monwealth</HI> not to revenge &s;uch injuries done to the State: A Ma&s;ter of one of the&s;e Ships &s;aith, that he heard that there was with Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> at <HI>Lisborne,</HI> Capt. <HI>Pluncket,</HI> Gapt. <HI>Muckell,</HI> and &s;everal others e|minent for their Rebellious actings again&s;t the Com|mon-wealth of <HI>England;</HI> but what hath been done &s;ince the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Portingall</HI> refu&s;ed to protect them, he knoweth not for that it is &s;ome weeks &s;ince he had this Intelligence.</P>
<P>Truly Sir, it is not onely my opinion, but the judg|ment of many others, well wi&s;hers to the peace and tranquility of this Nation, that if men would con&s;ider how much it gives advantage to the common Enemy, which &s;tudy nothing &s;o much, as to find an advantage to bring us into new mi&s;eries, there would not be &s;uch divi&s;ions among&s;t men; but every one &s;hould rather joyn together as one for defence of the whole body, and lay a&s;ide back-bitings, and reproachful &s;peeches which are oftentimes the cau&s;e of much evill, and draweth others to do &s;ome things which may be thought unrea&s;onable. The&s;e kinds of di&s;tempers are commonly moved fir&s;t in di&s;quiet &s;pirits, who ordi|narily
<PB N="3" REF="3">crave more then is fit to be granted, looking rather on what they fancy to be good, or in their own private judgments imagine to be evil, then to inform them&s;elves, that the fir&s;t degree to attain vertue and hone&s;ty, is to obey the Lawes, and reverence tho&s;e that are in Authority over us, and for want of a due ob&s;er|vation hereof, many have plunged them&s;elves into e|minent dangers, and cau&s;e feares and jealou&s;ies where needeth not any; for as all men ought to be governed by Lawes and certain Rules, &s;o ought there to be &s;ome per&s;ons that &s;hall put tho&s;e Lawes in execution, and thereby govern the people: <HI>Scipio</HI> &s;aith, it is the Say|lors endeavour to get a faire pa&s;&s;age, the travel of the <HI>Phi&s;ician</HI> tendeth to health, and a Captains labor is for victory: &s;o &s;hould it be the glory and vertue of e|very privat man, to be dilligent in his Calling, and not to meddle with tho&s;e things that are too high for him.</P>
<P>This advice I have thought good to remember you of, yet it is not becau&s;e you have occa&s;ion to make u&s;e thereof in your own particular; but to the end you may as oppertunity is mini&s;tred, per&s;wade with o|thers whom you find aver&s;e and ob&s;tinate, and would &s;tir up &s;uch Coales which &s;hould not onely &s;et their Neighbors, but their own hou&s;e on fire. I &s;hall re|turn again to our Intelligence.</P>
<P>Two gallant Ships are arrived in this Harbor, ap|pertaining to London Marchants, they are richly la|den, and intend by the next fair wind, to hoi&s;t &s;ail for the port of London, to which place, we make not a|ny que&s;tion but they may come with &s;afety. The Sea-men in the &s;aid Ships, expre&s;s a very good affe|ction
<PB N="4" REF="4">to the Parliament of England, and &s;ay that they will willingly &s;acrifice their lives upon occa&s;ion for defence of this Common-Wealth, under the pre&s;ent Government, without King or Hou&s;e of Lords, which is the more remarkable, in re&s;pect the &s;aid words were uttered before they heard of the Engage|ment, or had it tendered unto any of them. The&s;e Seamen are come home very rich, and do much la|ment the lo&s;s of &s;ome of their Country men, whom they hear to be lately taked by the <HI>French,</HI> yet if any &s;uch thing hath been done, the Parliaments and cheif Governors of that Nation, are &s;aid to be no abetters or countinancers thereof, pre&s;&s;ing rather a de&s;ire of a continuance of a League and friend&s;hip, then to grant Letters of Mart. The la&s;t Ship taken, was of a con|&s;iderable value, and was not taken without a hot fight, and the lo&s;s of many men; and although in the com|bate the <HI>French,</HI> as &s;uch as were with them (men of War and of greater force then their competitors) might get the better at fir&s;t, yet be it known unto the whole world, that the enterpri&s;es of Pirats and ba|ni&s;hed per&s;ons are dangerous, and &s;eldom come to a good end.</P>
<P>About three days &s;ince here arrived a man of War, which bringeth intelligence, that as they &s;troke into harbor on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Holland,</HI> they heard it related, that the King of <HI>Portingal</HI> had given P. <HI>Rupert</HI> a day certain to put forth to Sea, not permiting him to &s;tay beyond the time limited in any of his Harbors; and the time being expired, it is reported that there hath been a great fight betwixt him, and Collonel <HI>Blake,</HI> in which conflict the victory is given to the &s;aid Collonel <HI>Blake,</HI> and 5: of P. <HI>Ruperts</HI> Ships, are &s;aid to be &s;unk
<PB N="5" REF="4">and taken, without the lo&s;s of one of ours; but of this, I &s;uppo&s;e you have better intelligence at London then any with us.</P>
<P>Having taken liberty thus freely to di&s;cour&s;e of &s;uch things, which either hapen here or are credibly infor|med by good hands, give me leave to enlarge my &s;elf a little further, in acquainting you what we hear con|cerning a plantation belonging to the <HI>Common-wealth</HI> of <HI>England:</HI> called the <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> about which I recei|ved a Letter the la&s;t night, what your intelligence was at LONDON, which came onely from a privat hand, and renders no rea&s;on but Com|mon fame; yet for that, <HI>I</HI> have heard that vulgar reports are not always &s;o much to be &s;lighted, as that no an&s;wer at all were nece&s;&s;ary to be returned, <HI>I</HI> &s;hall make bold to inform you, in breif what is related here by the Sea-men, touching that bu&s;ine&s;s, which (&s;ay they) is only thus; An unskilful Pilot mi&s;&s;ing his compa&s;s, and thereby failing of the intended harbor, to vindicate his own reputation per&s;waded the Marri|ners, that the I&s;land was removed out of the place in which it formerly &s;tood: And how far his Rheto|rick might &s;way their beleif in this kind I know not, but of this <HI>I</HI> am &s;ure, that it gains little credit of any others that hear thereof.</P>

<P><HI>SInce the writing of the&s;e lines, newes is come hither, that there is a great difference betwixt the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>and the</HI> Iri&s;h, <HI>in the I&s;le of</HI> Silly, <HI>and that</HI> Noy <HI>could hardly appea&s;e the &s;ame without blowes.
