<HEAD>FRANCE Painted to the Life. The Fir&s;t Book. The beginning of our Journey, the nature of the Sea, a Farewell to <HI>England.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_ON Thur&s;day the 28th of <HI>June,</HI> at the time when <HI>England</HI> had recei|ved the cheif beauty of <HI>France,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> had &s;een the cheif beauties of <HI>England,</HI> we went to Sea in a Bark of <HI>Dover</HI>; The Port we arrived at <HI>Diepe</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> the hour three in the afternoon: the wind fair and high&punc; able, had
<PB N="2" REF="4">
it continued in that point, to have given us a waft|age as &s;peedy as our longing. Two hours before night it came about to the We&s;tward, and the tide al&s;o not befriending us, our pa&s;&s;age became tedi|ous and trouble&s;ome. The next day being dedi|cate to the glory of God, in memory of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> we took the benifit of the ebb to a&s;&s;i&s;t us again&s;t the wind. This brought us out of the &s;ight of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and the floud en&s;uing compelled us to our an|chor.</P>
<P>I had now lei&s;ure to &s;ee <HI>Gods wonders in the deep,</HI> wonders indeed to us, which had never before &s;een them: but too much familiarity had made them none other than the Saylers play-fellows. The waves &s;triving by an inbred ambition which &s;hould be the highe&s;t, which foremo&s;t: precedency and &s;uper-eminency was equally de&s;ired, and each en|joyed it in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The wind more covetous in appearance to play with the water than di&s;turbe it, did onely rock the billow, and &s;eemed indeed to dandle the Ocean. You would at another time have thought, that the Seas had onely danced at the Winds whi&s;tle, or that the Wind &s;training it &s;elf to a treble, and the Seas by a di&s;diapa&s;on &s;upply|ing the ba&s;e, had tuned a Coranto to our Ship. For &s;o orderly we ro&s;e and fell, according to the time and note of the billow, that her violent agitation might be thought to be nothing but a nimble Gal|liard filled with Capers. The nimblene&s;s of the waves, and corre&s;pondency of our Bark unto them, was not to all our company alike plea&s;ing: what in me moved onely a reverend and awful plea&s;ure, was to others an occa&s;ion of &s;ickne&s;s:
<PB N="3" REF="4">
their heads giddy, their joynts enfeebled, their &s;tomacks loathing &s;u&s;tenance, and with great pangs avoiding what they had taken&punc; In their mouthes nothing &s;o frequent, as that of <HI>Horace,</HI>

Whether it be that the noi&s;om &s;mels which ari&s;e from the &s;altne&s;s and tartne&s;s of that Region of waters, poi&s;oneth the brain? or that the ungo|verned and unequal motion of the Ship &s;tirreth and un&s;ettleth the &s;tomack, or both? we may conje|cture with the Philo&s;phers rather than determine. This I am &s;ure of, that the Cabbins and Deck were but as &s;o many Ho&s;pitals or Pe&s;t-hou&s;es filled with di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons: whil&s;t I and the Marriners one|ly made good the hatches: here did I &s;ee the &s;ca|ly Nation of that Kingdom &s;olace them&s;elves in the brim of the waves, rejoycing in the light and warmne&s;s of the day, and yet &s;pouting from their mouthes &s;uch quantity of waters, as if they had purpo&s;ed to quench that fire which gave it. They danced about our ve&s;&s;el, as if &s;he had been a mo|ving May-pole; and that with &s;uch a delightful <HI>de|corum,</HI> that you never &s;aw a Mea&s;ure better troaden with le&s;s art: And now I know not what wave bigger than the re&s;t&punc; to&s;&s;ed up our Ship &s;o high, that I once more ken'd the coa&s;t of <HI>England</HI>; an object

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe next ebb brought us in &s;ight of the &s;ea-coa&s;t of <HI>Normandy,</HI> a &s;hoar &s;o evenly compo|&s;ed and levelled, that it &s;eemeth the work of Art not Nature, The Rock all the way of an equal height, ri&s;ing from the bottom to the top in a per|pendicular, and withal &s;o &s;mooth and poli&s;hed, that if you dare beleive it the work of Nature, you mu&s;t al&s;o think that Nature wrought it by the line, and &s;hewed an art in it, above the imitation of an Arti&s;t; This wall is the Northern bound of this Province; the South part of it being confined with <HI>Le-Maine la Beau&s;&s;e &amp; l' I&s;le du France.</HI> On the Ea&s;t it is divided from <HI>Picardy</HI> by the River of <HI>Some,</HI> and on the We&s;t it is bounded with the O|cean, and the little River <HI>Crenon</HI> which &s;evereth it from a corner of <HI>Britain.</HI> It extendeth in length from the beginning of the 9th degree of longitude to the middle of the 23. <HI>viz.</HI> from the <HI>Cape</HI> of St. <HI>Saviour</HI> We&s;t, to the Port town of St. <HI>Valeria</HI> Ea&s;t. For breadth it lieth partly in the 49th partly in the 50th degree of latitude. So that reckoning 60. miles to a degree, we &s;hall find it to contain 270.
<PB N="6" REF="6">
Engli&s;h miles in length, and 60 Engli&s;h miles in breadth where it is narrowe&s;t.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the Nations it was accounted a part of <HI>Gallia Celtica,</HI> the name <HI>Neu&s;tria.</HI> This new title it got by receiving into it a new Nation. A peo|ple that had &s;o terribly &s;poiled the Maritine Coa&s;ts of <HI>England, France</HI> and <HI>Belgia,</HI> that <HI>a furore Normannorum</HI> was in&s;erted into the <HI>Letany.</HI> Ori|ginally they were of <HI>Norway,</HI> their name importeth it: <HI>Anno</HI> 800. or thereabouts they began fir&s;t to be accounted one of the plagues of <HI>Europe:</HI> 900. they &s;eated them&s;elves in <HI>France</HI> by permi&s;&s;ion of <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Balde,</HI> and the valour of <HI>Rollo</HI> their Captain. Before this they had made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of <HI>Ireland,</HI> though they long held it not, and <HI>Anno</HI> 1067. they added to the glory of their name by the Conque&s;t of <HI>England.</HI> You would think them a people not onely born to the warrs, but to victory. But <HI>&V;t frugum &s;emina mutato &s;o|lo degenerant, &s;ic illa genuina feritas eorum amaeni|tate mollita e&s;t. Florus</HI> &s;pake it of the <HI>Gaules</HI> re|moved into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> it is appliable to the <HI>Norwegians</HI> tran&s;planted into <HI>Gallia</HI>; yet fell they not &s;udden|ly and at once into the want of courage, which now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth them. During the time they con|tinued <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they attempt the Kingdom of <HI>Na|ples</HI> and <HI>Antioch</HI> with a fortune an&s;werable to their valour. Being once oppre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>French,</HI> and in&s;laved under that Monarchy, they grew pre|&s;ently Cre&s;t fall'n, and at once lo&s;t both their &s;pi|rits and their liberty.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent <HI>Norman</HI> then is but the corruption of the ancient: the heir of his name, and perhaps
<PB N="7" REF="6">
his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; but neither of his &s;trength nor his manhood: Bondage and a fruitful &s;oil hath &s;o e|ma&s;culated them, that it is lo&s;t labour to look for <HI>Normans</HI> in <HI>Normandy.</HI> There remaineth almo&s;t nothing in them of their Progenitors but the re|mainders of two qualities, and tho&s;e al&s;o degene|rated, if not ba&s;tards; a penurious pride, and an ungoverned doggedne&s;s: Neither of them become their fortune or their habit, yet to tho&s;e they are con&s;tant. Finally, view him in his rags and de|jected countenance, and you would &s;wear it im|po&s;&s;ible, that tho&s;e &s;nakes &s;hould be the de&s;cen|dents of tho&s;e brave <HI>Heroes</HI> which &s;o often trium|phed over both Religions, foyling the <HI>Saracens,</HI> and vanqui&s;hing the <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>But perchance their courage is evaporated into wit, and then the change made the better. <HI>Ortelius</HI> would &s;eem to per&s;wade us to this conceit of them, and well might do it, if his words were Oracle. <HI>Le Gens</HI> (&s;aith he, &s;peaking of this Nation) <HI>&s;ont de plus accorls, &amp; &s;ubtills d' e&s;prit de la Gaule.</HI> A Character for which the French will little thank him, who (if he &s;peak truth) mu&s;t in matter of de&s;cretion give precedency to their va&s;&s;als. But as <HI>Imbat</HI> a French Leader &s;aid of the <HI>Florentines</HI> in the fifth book of <HI>Guicciardine, Non &s;upena done con|&s;i&s;te&s;&s;e lingeque tanto celebrare de Fior<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntini,</HI> &s;o may I &s;ay of the <HI>Normans</HI>: for my part I could never yet find, where that great wit of theirs lay. Cer|tain it is, that as the <HI>French</HI> in general are termed the <HI>King's a&s;&s;es:</HI> &s;o may the&s;e men peculiarly be called the <HI>A&s;&s;es of the French,</HI> or the verie&s;t A&s;&s;es of the re&s;t. For what with the unproportionable
<PB N="8" REF="7">
rents which they pay to their Lords on the one &s;ide, and the immea&s;urable taxes laid upon them by the King on the other; they are kept in &s;uch a perpetuated cour&s;e of drudgery, that there is no place for wit or wi&s;dom left among&s;t them. Liber|ty is the Mother and Nur&s;e of tho&s;e two qualities; and therefore the <HI>Romans</HI> (not unhappily) ex|pre&s;&s;ed both the condition of a Free-man and a di&s;creet and mode&s;t per&s;onage by this one word <HI>Ingenuous.</HI> Why the <HI>French</HI> King &s;hould lay a greater burden upon the backs of this Nation, than their fellows, I cannot determine. Perchance it is becau&s;e they have been twice conquered by them (once from King <HI>John,</HI> and again from <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth) and therefore undergo a double &s;ervitude. It may be to abate their natural pride and &s;tub|bornne&s;s. Likely al&s;o it is, that being a revolting people, and apt to an apo&s;ta&s;ie from their Allegi|ance, they may by this meanes be kept impoveri&s;h|ed, and by con&s;equence di&s;abled from &s;uch practi|&s;es. This a French Gentleman of good under|&s;tanding told me, that it was generally conceited in <HI>France,</HI> that the <HI>Normans</HI> would &s;uddenly and unanimou&s;ly betray their Country to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> were their King a <HI>Cath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">like.</HI></P>
<P>But there is a further cau&s;e yet of their beggar|line&s;s and poverty, which is, the litigiou&s;ne&s;s and frequent going to law (as we call it:) <HI>Ortelius,</HI> however he failed in the fir&s;t part of the Chara|cter, in the conclu&s;ion of it hath done them ju&s;tice. <HI>Mais en generall</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>its &s;ont &s;cavans an pa&s;&s;ible en pro&s;&s;es &amp; pluideries.</HI> They are pretty well ver&s;ed in the querks of the Law, and have wit more than enough to wrangle.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="7">In this they agree exactly well with the Inhabi|tants of our Country of <HI>Norfolke. Ex infima plebe non pauci reperiuntur</HI> (&s;aith Mr. <HI>Cambden) qui, &s;i nihil &s;it litium, lites tamen ex ip&s;is jaris apicibus &s;e|rere callent.</HI> They are pretty fellows to find out quirks in Law, and to it they will, what&s;oever it co&s;t them. Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> &s;pake not at random, or by the gue&s;s: for be&s;ides what my &s;elf ob&s;erved in them at my being once among them in a <HI>Colledge-progre&s;s</HI>; I have heard, that there have been no le&s;s than 340. <HI>Ni&s;i prius's</HI> tried there at one <HI>A&s;&s;i&s;es.</HI> The rea&s;on of this likene&s;s between the two Na|tions, I conjecture to be, the re&s;emblance of the &s;ite and the &s;oyl: both lie upon the Sea, with a long and &s;pacious coa&s;t, both enjoy a Country champain, little &s;well'd with hils, and for the mo&s;t part, of a light and &s;andy mould. To proceed to more particulars, if there be any difference be|tween the two Provinces, it is onely this, that the Country of <HI>Normandy</HI> is much better, and the people of <HI>Norfolk</HI> are &s;omewhat the richer.</P>
<P>For indeed the Country of <HI>Normandy</HI> is enrich|ed with a fat and liking &s;oil, &s;uch a one, <HI>quae demum votis re&s;pondet avari Agricolae,</HI> which may &s;atisfie the expectation of the Husbandman, were it never &s;o exorbitant. In my life I never &s;aw Corn-fields more large and lovely extended in an equal level, almo&s;t as far as eye-reach. The wheat (for I &s;aw little Barley) of a fair length in the &s;talk, and &s;o heavy in the ear, that it even bended double, you would think the grain had a de&s;ire to ki&s;s the earth its Mother; or that it purpo&s;ed by making it &s;elf away into the ground, to &s;ave the Plow-man his
<PB N="10" REF="8">
next years labour. Thick it groweth, and &s;o per|fectly void of weeds, that no garden can be ima|gined to be kept cleaner by art, than the&s;e fields are by nature. Pa&s;ture ground it hath little, and le&s;s meadow: yet &s;ufficient to nouri&s;h tho&s;e few Cat|tel they have in it. In all the way between <HI>Diepe</HI> and <HI>Pontois,</HI> I &s;aw but two flocks of Sheep, and then not above forty in a flock. Kine they have in &s;ome mea&s;ure, but not fat, nor large: without the&s;e, there were no living for them. The Noble&s;t eat the fle&s;h, whiles the Farmer feeds on Butter and Chee&s;e, and that but &s;paringly. But the mi&s;erable &s;tates of the <HI>Norman pai&s;&s;ant,</HI> we wiil deferre till another opportunity. Swine al&s;o they have in pretty number, and &s;ome Pullen in their back&s;ides, but of neither an exce&s;s.

Before it, went a bell continually tinckling, at the &s;ound whereof all &s;uch as are in their hou&s;es, being warned that then their God goeth by them, make &s;ome &s;hew of reverence; tho&s;e which meet it in the &s;treet, with bended knees and elevated heads doing it honour. The Prote&s;tants of this bell make an u&s;e more reli|gious, and u&s;e it as a warning or a watch-peal, to avoid that &s;treet through which they hear it coming. This invention of the Bell hath &s;ome|what of <HI>Turci&s;me,</HI> it being the cu&s;tom there, at their Canonical hours, when they hear the cryers bawl|ing in the &s;teeples; to fall pro&s;trate on the ground where&s;oever they are, and to ki&s;s it thrice, &s;o doing their devotions to <HI>Mahomet.</HI> The carrying it about the &s;treets hath no que&s;tion in it a touch of the <HI>Jew:</HI> this Ceremony being borrowed from that of the carrying about the Ark upon the &s;houl|ders of the Prie&s;ts. The other main part of it, which is the adoration, is derived from the Hea|then; there never being a people but they which afforded divine honour to things inanimate. But the people indeed I cannot blame for this idola|trous devotion, their con&s;ciences being per&s;waded, that what they &s;ee pa&s;s by them is the very body of

their Saviour. For my part could the like beleif po&s;&s;e&s;s my under&s;tanding&punc; I could meet it with a greater reverence, then their charge can enjoyn me. The Prie&s;ts and Doctors of the people are to be condemned onely, who impo&s;e and inforce this &s;in upon their bearers, and doubtle&s;s there is a reward which attendeth them for it. Of &s;tanding it is &s;o you~g, that I never met with it before the year 1215. Then did Pope <HI>Innocent</HI> ordain in a Council holden at <HI>Rome,</HI> that there &s;hould be a Pixe made to cover the Bread, and a Bell bought to be rung before it. The adoration of it was enjoyned by Pope <HI>Honorius Anno Dom.</HI> 1226.

<P>It is now time to go on in our journey to <HI>Roven.</HI> The Cart &s;tayeth, and it is fit we were in it; Hor&s;es we could get none for money, and for love we did not expect them: we are now mount|ed in our Chariot, for &s;o we mu&s;t call it. An Engli&s;h man thought it a plain Cart, and if it needs will
<PB N="17" REF="11">
have the honour of being a Chariot, let it, &s;ure I am it was never ordained for a triumph. At one end were fa&s;tened three carka&s;&s;es of Hor&s;es, and three bodies which had been once Hor&s;es and now were worn to dead Images. Had the &s;tatue of a man been placed on any one of them, it might have been hang'd up at an Inn door to repre&s;ent Saint <HI>George</HI> on hor&s;e-back: &s;o livele&s;s they were and &s;o little moving; yet at la&s;t they began to crawl, for go they could not. This converted me from my former here&s;ie, and made me apprehend life in them, but it was &s;o little, that it &s;eemed onely e|nough to carry them to the next pack af Hounds. Thus accomodated we bad Farewell to <HI>Diepe,</HI> and proceeded with a pace &s;o &s;low, that we thought our journey to <HI>Roven</HI> would prove a mo&s;t perfect Emblem of the motion of the ninth Sphere, which was 49000. years in fini&s;hing. But this was not our greate&s;t mi&s;ery: The rain fell on us through our Tilt, which for the many holes in it we would have thought a net. The durt brake plentifully in upon us through the rails of our Chariot, &amp; the unequal and unproportionable pace of it &s;tartled almo&s;t every bone of us. I prote&s;t I marvel how a French-man dur&s;t adventure in it. Thus endured we all the di&s;|ea&s;es of a journey, and the danger of three &s;everal deaths, drowning, choaking with the mire, and breaking of the wheel, be&s;ides a fear of being fa|mi&s;hed before we came to our Inn, which was &s;ix French miles from us.

<P>On the left hand we &s;aw <HI>Argues,</HI> once famous for a &s;iege laid about it by our <HI>Richard</HI> the fir&s;t, but wa&s;ted &s;peedily by the French. It is now (as be|fore I told you) the Pari&s;h Church of <HI>Diepe Pro|te&s;tants,</HI> their Preachers were Mr. <HI>Courteau</HI> and Mr. <HI>Mondeme,</HI> who had each of them an yearly &s;ti|pend, fifty pound or thereabouts. A poor pay, if the faithful di&s;charge of that duty were not a re|ward unto it &s;elf above the value of gold and &s;i|ver. To in&s;tance in none of the&s;e beggerly Vil|lages we pa&s;t through: we came at la&s;t unto <HI>To&s;tes,</HI> the place de&s;tinate to our Lodging, a Town like the wor&s;er &s;ort of Market Towns in <HI>England.</HI> There our Charioter brought us to the ruines of an hou&s;e, an Alehou&s;e I would &s;carce have thought it, and yet in &s;pite of my teeth it mu&s;t be an Inn, yea, and that an honourable one too, as <HI>Don Quixot's</HI> Ho&s;t told him. De&s;pair of finding there either bedding or victuals, made me ju&s;t like the fellow at the Gallows, who when he might have been reprei|ved, on condition he would marry a Wench, which there &s;ued for him, having veiwed well, cried to the Hangman to drive on his Cart. The truth is, <HI>I' e&s;chappay du tonnere etrencheu en l'e&s; lair,</HI> according to the French proverb; I fell out of the frying-pan into the hot fire. One of the hou&s;e (a ragged fellow I am &s;ure he was, and &s;o mo&s;t likely to live there) brought us to a room &s;omewhat of kindred to a Charnel-hou&s;e; as dark and as dampi&s;h: I confe&s;s it was paved with brick at the bottom, and had towards the Orchard a pretty hole, which in
<PB N="19" REF="12">
former times had been a window, but now the gla&s;s was all vani&s;hed. By the light that came in at the hole, I fir&s;t perceived that I was not in <HI>England.</HI> There &s;tood in the chamber three beds, if at the lea&s;t it be lawful &s;o to call them. The foundation of them was of &s;traw, &s;o infinitely thronged toge|ther, that the wooll-pack which our Judges fit on in the Parliament were melted butter to them; up|on this lay a medley of flocks and feathers toge|ther, &s;owed up in a large bag (for I am confident it was not a Tick) but &s;o ill ordered, that the knobs &s;tuck out on each &s;ide of it, like a crabtree-cudgel. He mu&s;t needs have fle&s;h enough that lieth upon one of them; otherwi&s;e the &s;econd night would wear out his bones. The &s;heets which they brought for us were &s;o cour&s;e, that in my con&s;ciente no Marriner would vouch&s;afe to u&s;e them for a &s;ail: and the Coverlid &s;o bare, that if a man would un|dertake to reckon the threeds, he need not mi&s;s one of the number. The Napery of the Table was &s;utable to the bedding, &s;o foul and durty, that I dur&s;t not conceive it had ever been wa&s;hed above once, and yet the poor cloth looked as briskly, as if it had been promi&s;ed for the whole year en&s;uing to &s;cape many a &s;couring. The Napkins were fit companions for the cloath; <HI>&V;num &s;i noveris, om|nes no&s;ti.</HI> By my de&s;cription of the Inn, you may gue&s;s at the re&s;t of <HI>France.</HI> Not altogether &s;o wretched, yet is the alteration almo&s;t in&s;en&s;i|ble.</P>
<P>Let us now walk into the Kitchen, and ob&s;erve their provi&s;ion, and here we found a mo&s;t terrible execu&s;ion committed on the per&s;on of a Pullet.
<PB N="20" REF="13">
My Ho&s;te&s;s, cruel woman, had cut the throat of it, and without plucking off the feathers, tare it into pieces with her hands, and afterwards took away skin and feathers together, ju&s;t as we &s;trip Rabbets in <HI>England.</HI> This done, it was clapt into a pan, and fried into a &s;upper. In other places where we could get meat for the &s;pit, it u&s;eth to be pre&s;ently broached, and laid perpendicularly over the fire: three turns at the mo&s;t di&s;patcheth it, and bringeth it up to the table, rather &s;corched than roa&s;ted; I &s;ay, where we could get it, for in the&s;e ra&s;cally Inns you cannot have what you would, but what you may, and that al&s;o not at the cheape&s;t. At <HI>Pontoi&s;e</HI> we met with a Rabbet, and we thought we had found a great purcha&s;e. Larded it was, as all meat is in that Country, otherwi&s;e it is &s;o lean, it would never endure the roa&s;ting. In the eating it proved &s;o tough, that I could not be per&s;waded that it was any more than three removes from that Rabbet which was in the Ark. The price half a Crown Engli&s;h: My Companions thought it over dear, to me it &s;eem'd very rea&s;onable, for certainly the gra&s;s that fed it was worth more than thrice the money: but I return to <HI>To&s;tes.</HI></P>
<P>And it is time, you might perchance el&s;e have lo&s;t the &s;ight of mine Ho&s;te&s;s and her Daughters, you would have &s;worn at fir&s;t blu&s;h they had been of a bloud, and it had been great pitty, had it been otherwi&s;e. The &s;alutation of <HI>Horace, O mater pul|chra, filia pulchrior,</HI> was never &s;o &s;ea&s;onable as here. Not to honour them with a further chara|cter let this &s;uffice that their per&s;ons kept &s;o excel|lent <HI>decorum</HI> with the hou&s;e and furniture, that one
<PB N="21" REF="13">
could not po&s;&s;ibly make u&s;e of <HI>Tullies, Quam di&s;|pari dominaris domino!</HI> But this is not their luck onely. The Women not of <HI>Normandy</HI> alone, but generally of all <HI>France</HI> are forced to be contented with a little beauty; and &s;he which with us is rec|koned among the vulgar; would among&s;t them be taken for a Prince&s;s. But of the French Women more, when we have taken a view of the Dames of <HI>Paris,</HI> now onely &s;omewhat of their habit and con|dition. Their habit in which they differ from the re&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> is the attire of their heads, which hangeth down their backs in fa&s;hion of a vail. In <HI>Roven</HI> and the greater Cities, it is made of linnen pure and decent, here and in the villages it cannot po&s;&s;ibly be any thing el&s;e than an old di&s;h-clout turned out of &s;ervice, or the corner of a table-cloth re&s;erved from wa&s;hing. Their be&s;t condition is not alwayes vi&s;ible, they &s;hew it onely in the morn|ings, or when you are ready to depart, and that is their begging. You &s;hall have about you &s;uch a throng of the&s;e ill faces, and every one whining out this ditty, <HI>Pour les &s;ervantes</HI>; that one might with greater ea&s;e di&s;tribute a dole at a rich mans funeral, then give them a penny: Had you a pur|po&s;e to give them unasked, their importunity will prevent your &s;peedie&s;t bounty. After all this im|portunate begging, their ambition reacheth no higher than a <HI>Sol</HI>: He that giveth more out-bid|deth their expectation, and &s;hall be counted a &s;pend-thrift.</P>
<P>But the principal ornaments of the&s;e times are the men-&s;ervants, the ragged&s;t regiment that ever I yet looked upon. Such a thing as a Chamberlain
<PB N="22" REF="14">
was never heard of among them, and good clothes are as little known there as he. By the habit of his attendants a man would think him&s;elf in Gaole, their clothes either full of patches, or el&s;e open to the skin. Bid one of them wipe your boots, he pre&s;ently hath recour&s;e to the curtains; with tho&s;e he will perhaps rub over one &s;ide, and leave the other to be made clean by the Gue&s;t. It is enough for him that he hath written the coppy. They wait alwayes with their hats on their heads, and &s;o al&s;o do &s;ervants before their Ma&s;ters: Attending-bare|headed is as much out of fa&s;hion there as in <HI>Tur|key.</HI> Of all <HI>French</HI> fa&s;hions in my opinion the mo&s;t unfitting and un&s;eeming.

<P>Certainly among the Ancients this promi&s;cuous covering of the head was never heard of, it was with them the chief &s;ign of freedom, as is well known to tho&s;e which are conver&s;ant with antiqui|ty. The <HI>Lacones</HI> a people of <HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> after they had obtained to be made free Denizens of <HI>Lacedaemon,</HI> in &s;ign of their now gotten liberty would never go into the battel, <HI>ni&s;i pileati,</HI> but with their hats on.

of <HI>Alexander, ab Alexandro,</HI> the placing of an hat on the top of a &s;pear, was u&s;ed as a token to incite the people to their liberty which had been oppre&s;|&s;ed by <HI>Tyrants: Per pileum in ba&s;t &acirc; propo&s;itum ad libertatem proclamari.</HI> But among the <HI>Romans</HI> we have more variety.

It &s;tandeth on all &s;ides environed with Mountains, the North excepted, and hath a large and plea&s;ant walk of meadow by the river &s;ide, to the South-Ea&s;tward, as <HI>Oxford</HI> hath towards <HI>Iffley.</HI> It is &s;eat|ed on the principal River of <HI>France,</HI> di&s;tant from the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of that Countrey fifty miles Eng|li&s;h or thereabouts; as <HI>Oxford</HI> on the <HI>Thames</HI> and from <HI>London</HI>: watered al&s;o it is with two &s;mall Rillets, <HI>Ro&s;ee</HI> and <HI>Renelle,</HI> as the other with <HI>Char|well</HI> and <HI>Evenlode.</HI> The difference is, that <HI>Oxford</HI> is &s;eated &s;omewhat higher on the &s;welling of an hill, and a little more removed from tho&s;e moun|tains which environ it, and that the Rivers which run through &s;ome part of <HI>Roven,</HI> do onely wa&s;h the precincts of the other. The buildings are in &s;ome places wood, in &s;ome &s;tone, in others both. The hou&s;es without juttings or overlets four &s;tories high, and in the front not very beautiful. The

mo&s;t promi&s;ing hou&s;e which mine eyes met with was that of Mr. <HI>Boniface,</HI> who being of ob&s;cure parents; and having rai&s;ed him&s;elf a fortune in the wars again&s;t the <HI>League,</HI> here built a receptacle for his age. It is fa&s;hioned after the manner of new buildings in <HI>London,</HI> compo&s;ed all of dainty white &s;tone, &s;quare and poli&s;hed. On the partition be|twixt the fir&s;t &s;tory and the &s;econd it hath the&s;e words engraven, <HI>&V;t &amp; Virtute Martisopus; Ten|tanda via amore &amp; armis.</HI> A Motto &s;utable to his ri&s;ing.</P>
<P>The other buildings of note are the <HI>Bridge</HI> (for I as yet omit the Hou&s;e of Parliament and the Churches) and the Town wall by it. The Bridge whil&s;t it was all &s;tanding, was thought to have been the faire&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t piece of that kind in all <HI>France,</HI> it con&s;i&s;ted of twelve arches large and high, there now remain but &s;even of them, the re&s;t being broken down by the Engli&s;h, in the falling of their affairs in <HI>France,</HI> the better to make good the Town again&s;t the French. The River is here about the breadth of the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>Fullham.</HI> Be|tween the River and the Town wall is the <HI>Ex|change</HI> or meeting place of the Merchants, paved with broad and even pebble-&s;tones; in breadth up to the wallwards thirty yeards, in length a hun|dred. A fine walk in fair weather. All along the bank&s;ide lay the Ships, which by rea&s;on of the bro|ken bridge come up hither, and on occa&s;ion high|er; a good turn for <HI>Paris.</HI> The wall for the length of an hundred yeards is as &s;treight as one may lay a line; of a ju&s;t height, and compo&s;ed of &s;quare and excellent &s;tone &s;o cunningly laid, that I never

&s;aw the &s;ide of a Noble mans hou&s;e built more hand&s;omly. But it is not onely the beauty of the wall which <HI>Roven</HI> delighteth in, there mu&s;t &s;ome|what al&s;o be expected of it for &s;trength. To which purpo&s;e it might &s;eem indifferently well, were there &s;ome addition of earth within it. It is well helped on the out&s;ide by the breadth and depth of the ditches, but more by St. <HI>Katharines</HI> Fort &s;eated on an hill at the Ea&s;t &s;ide of it. A Fort which, were it &s;trengthned according to the mo|dern art of fortifying, would much a&s;&s;ure the Town, and make it at once both a &s;lave and a Commander. The <HI>Mar&s;hal</HI> D'c <HI>Anere,</HI> when he was Lieutenant here for the <HI>Queen-Mother,</HI> began to fortifie this Mountain, <HI>Quilleboeu&s;e</HI> and other places of importance; but upon his death they were all razed. What were his projects in it, they know be&s;t which were acquainted with his ambition. Certainly the jarrs which he had &s;own among the Princes, one with the other, and between them and the King, &s;hew that they were not intended for no|thing.</P>
<P>There are in <HI>Roven</HI> thirty two Pari&s;h Churches, be&s;ides tho&s;e which belong to <HI>Abbeys</HI> and <HI>Religi|ous</HI> Hou&s;es; of which the mo&s;t beautiful is that of St. <HI>Audom</HI> or <HI>Owen,</HI> once Arch-bi&s;hop of this City. The &s;eat and Church of the Arch-bi&s;hop is that of <HI>No&s;tre-dame,</HI> a building far more gorgeous in the out&s;ide than within. It pre&s;ents it &s;elf to you with a very gracious and maje&s;tical front, decked with mo&s;t curious imagery, and adorned with three &s;tately Towers. The fir&s;t called <HI>La tour St. Ro|main</HI>; the &s;econd <HI>La tour de beaurre</HI> (becau&s;e it

was built with that money which was rai&s;ed by Cardinal <HI>D' Amboy&s;e,</HI> for granting a di&s;pen&s;ation to eat butter in the <HI>Lent</HI>) and a third built over the Porch, or great Door, wherein is the great Bell &s;o much talked of: Within it is but plain and or|dinary, &s;uch as common Cathedral Churches u&s;ually are, &s;o big, &s;o fa&s;hioned. Behind the high Altar at a pillar on the left hand is the remainder of the Duke of <HI>Bedford</HI>'s Tomb, which for ought I could di&s;cern was nothing but an Epitaph, &s;ome three yeards high in the Pillar. I &s;aw nothing in it, which might move the envy of any Courtier to have it defaced, unle&s;s it were the title of <HI>Regent du Ro|jaume de France,</HI> which is the lea&s;t he merit|ed.</P>
<P>Somewhat Ea&s;tward beyond this is our <HI>Ladies Chappel,</HI> a pretty neat piece, and daintily &s;et out. There &s;tandeth on the top of the Screen the Image of the <HI>Virgin</HI> her &s;elf between two Angels. They have attired her in a red Mantle laced with two gold laces, a hand&s;om ruffe about her neck, a vail of fine lawn hanging down her back, and (to &s;hew that &s;he was the Queen of Heaven) a Crown up|on her head. In her left arm &s;he holds her Son in his &s;ide coat, a black hat and a golden hat-band. A jolly plump Lady &s;he &s;eemeth to be, of a flaxen hair, a ruddy lip, and a chearful complexion. 'Twere well the Painters would agree about the limming of her; otherwi&s;e we are like to have as many Ladies as Churches.

of apparel. Onely I could not but ob&s;erve how tho&s;e of St. <HI>Sepulchres Church en la rue St. Denis,</HI> hath placed her on the top of their Screen in a Coape, as if &s;he had taken on her the zeal of <HI>A|braham,</HI> and were going to make a bloudy &s;acrifice of her Son. They of <HI>No&s;tre-dame in Amiens</HI> have erected her Statue all in gold, with her Son al&s;o of the &s;ame mettal in her arms, ca&s;ting beams of gold round about her, as the Sun is painted in its full glory. Strange Idolatries! On the contra|ry, in the pari&s;h Church of <HI>Tury in la Beau&s;e</HI> &s;he is to be &s;een in a plain petticoat of red, and her other garments corre&s;pondent. In my mind this hold|eth mo&s;t proportion to her e&s;tate, and will but &s;erve to free their irreligion from an ab&s;urdity. If they will wor&s;hip her as a Nur&s;e with her Child in her arms, or at her brea&s;t, let them array her in &s;uch apparel as might be&s;eem a Carpenters Wife, &s;uch as &s;he might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have worn before the world had taken notice that &s;he was the Mother of her Saviour. If they mu&s;t needs have her in her e&s;tate of glory, as at <HI>Amiens</HI>; or of honour (be|ing now publikely acknowledged to be the ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s among Women) as at <HI>Paris</HI>: let them disburden her of her Child. To clap them thus both together, is a folly equally worthy of &s;corn &amp; laughter. Certainly had &s;he but &s;o much liberty as to make choice of her own clothes, I doubt not but &s;he would ob&s;erve a greater <HI>decorum.</HI> And there|fore I commend the Capouchins of <HI>Boulogne,</HI> who in a little &s;ide Chappel con&s;ecrated unto her, have placed onely an hand&s;om fair looking-gla&s;s upon her Altar, the be&s;t ornament of a Female Clo&s;et.

<P>This Church is &s;aid to have been built (I &s;hould rather think repaired) by <HI>Raoul</HI> or <HI>Rollo</HI> the fir&s;t Duke of <HI>Normandy:</HI> Since it hath been much beautified by the Engli&s;h, when they were Lords of this Province. It is the &s;eat of an Arch-bi&s;hop, a Dean and fifty Canons.

At that time he divided <HI>Normandy</HI> into &s;even <HI>Cathes, Rapes,</HI> or <HI>Baliwicks,</HI> viz. <HI>Roven, Caux, Con|&s;tentin, Caen, Eureux, Gi&s;ors,</HI> and <HI>Alenzon,</HI> This Court hath &s;upreme power to enquire into, and give &s;entence of all cau&s;es within the limits of <HI>Normandy.</HI> It receiveth appeals from the inferi|our Courts of the Dutchy unto it, but admitteth none from it.

This that King then granted, and all the following Kings to this time have &s;ucce&s;&s;ively confirmed it.

But the <HI>Nor|mans</HI> pleaded, that the benefit of that priviledge belonged onely to the Natives of that Country, and they pleaded with &s;uch fury, that the Baron was a|gain committed to pri&s;on, till the <HI>Queen Mother</HI> had wooed the people, <HI>pro e&acirc; &s;altem vice,</HI> to admit of his repreival.</P>

<HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> or <HI>Poland.</HI> If a man had de&s;ired to have &s;een a brief or an <HI>Epitome</HI> of the world, he could no where have received &s;uch &s;atisfaction, as by looking on us. I have already reckoned up the &s;everal nations, I will now lay open the &s;everal con|ditions. There were then to be found among the&s;e pa&s;&s;engers Men and Women, Lords and Serving-men, Schollars and Clowns, Ladies and Chamber|maids, Prie&s;ts and Lay-men, Gentlemen and Arti|ficers, people of all &s;exes, and almo&s;t of all ages&punc; If all the learning in the world were lo&s;t, it might be found in <HI>Plutarch,</HI> &s;o &s;aid <HI>Budaeus.</HI> If all the Nations in the world had been lo&s;t, they might have been found again in our Waggon, &s;o I: Seriou&s;ly I think our Coach to have been no unfit repre&s;en|tation of the Ark, a whole world of men and lan|guages might have grown out of it.</P>

Through many a mi&s;erable Village (<HI>Duburgs</HI> they call them) and one Town &s;omewhat bigger then the re&s;t, called <HI>Ecquille,</HI> we came that night to St. <HI>Claire,</HI> ten French miles from <HI>Roven.</HI> A poor Town, God wot, and had nothing in it remarkable, but an accident. There dwelt a Monk grown into great opinion for his &s;anctity; and one who had an e&s;pecial hand on &s;ore eyes: yet his ability here|in was not general, none being capable of cure from him, but pure Virgins. I per&s;wade my &s;elf <HI>France</HI> could not yeild him many Patients: and yet from all parts he was much &s;ought unto. Hope of cure, and a charitable opinion which they had of them&s;elves, had brought unto him divers di|&s;tre&s;&s;ed Dam&s;els, which I am confident had no in|tere&s;t in his miracle. In the &s;ame Inn (Alehou&s;e I &s;hould &s;ay) where we were to be harboured, there had put in a whole covey of the&s;e Ladies Er|rant. Pilgrims they called them&s;elves, and had come on foot two dayes journey to clear their eye-&s;ight. They had white vails hanging down their backs, which in part covered their faces, yet I perceived by a glimp&s;e, that &s;ome of them were pa&s;t cure: though my charity dur&s;t allow them Maids&punc; it was afraid to &s;uppo&s;e them Virgins: yet &s;o far I dare a&s;&s;ure them they &s;hould recover their &s;ight, that when they came home they &s;hould &s;ee their folly. At that time, what with too much watching on &s;hip-board, what with the tartne&s;s of the water, and the violence of the wind working upon me almo&s;t forty hours together whil&s;t I lay on the hatches mine eyes had gotten a rheum and redne&s;s.

<P>Having offered this unworthy, yet grateful &s;a|crifice to the Manes of that brave <HI>Heroe,</HI> I had the more lei&s;ure to behold <HI>Mante,</HI> and the Vines a|bout it, being the fir&s;t that ever I &s;aw. They are planted like our Hop-gardens, and grow up by the help of Poles, but not &s;o high. They are kept with little co&s;t: and yeild profit to an Husband|man &s;ufficient to make him rich, had he neither King nor Landlord. The Wine which is pre&s;&s;ed out of them is har&s;h and not plea&s;ing; as much dif|fering in &s;weetne&s;s from the Wines of <HI>Paris</HI> or <HI>Orleans,</HI> as their language doth in elegancy. The re&s;t of the Norman Wines which are not very fre|quent, as growing onely on the frontiers towards <HI>France,</HI> are of the &s;ame quality. As for the Town of <HI>Mante</HI> it &s;eemeth to have been of good &s;trength before the u&s;e of great Ordinance; having a wall, a competent ditch, and at every gate a Draw|bridge. They are &s;till &s;ufficient to guard their pullen from the Fox; and in the night time to &s;e|cure their hou&s;es from forrain burglaries: Once indeed they were able to make re&s;i&s;tance to a King of <HI>France,</HI> but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> were then within it: At la&s;t on honourable terms it yeilded, and was entred by <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;eventh the &s;econd of <HI>Augu&s;t, Anno</HI> 1449. The Town is for building and bigne&s;s &s;ome|what above the better &s;ort of Market Towns here in <HI>England.</HI></P>

<P>I Am now come to the <HI>French</HI> Women; and it were great pitty they &s;hould not immediately follow the di&s;cour&s;e of the Men; &s;o like they are one to the other, that one would think them to be the &s;ame, and that all the difference lay in the apparel: for per&s;on they are generally of an in|different &s;tature, their bodies &s;traight, and their wa&s;tes commonly &s;mall; but whether it be &s;o by, nature, or by much re&s;training of tho&s;e parts, I cannot &s;ay. It is &s;aid that an <HI>ab&s;olute Woman</HI> &s;hould have (among&s;t other qualities requi&s;ite) the parts of a <HI>French</HI> Woman from the neck to the girdle; but I beleeve it holdeth not good; their &s;houlders and backs being &s;o broad, that they hold no proportion with their middles: yet this may be the vice of their apparrel. <HI>Their hands</HI> are in my opinion the comelye&s;t and <HI>be&s;t or|dered</HI> parts of them, <HI>long, white, and &s;lender</HI>; were their faces an&s;werable, even an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> eye would apprehend them lovely: but here I find a pretty contradictory, the hand, as it is the be&s;t orna|ment of the whole &s;tructure, &s;o doth it mo&s;t di&s;|grace it: whether it be that ill dyet be the cau&s;e

<Q>Leda fuit nigris con&s;picienda comis.</Q>
<P>As <HI>Ovid</HI> hath it; yet was that blackne&s;s but a darker brown, and not &s;o fearful as this of the <HI>French</HI> women. Again the blackne&s;s of <HI>the hair is there accounted an ornament</HI>; when the face a|bout which it hangeth, is of &s;o perfect a comple|ction and &s;ymmetrie, that it giveth a lu&s;tre; then doth <HI>the hair &s;et forth the face, as a &s;haddow doth a picture,</HI> and the face becometh the hair, as <HI>a field argent doth a &s;able bearing</HI>: which kind of armou|ry the Heralds call the mo&s;t faire&s;t, But in this the <HI>French</HI> Women are mo&s;t unlucky, <HI>Don Quix|ote</HI> did not &s;o de&s;ervedly a&s;&s;ume to him&s;elf the name of <HI>the Knight of the ill favoured face</HI>; as may they that of the Damo&s;ells of it.

it a ju&s;t judgement of God upon our Nation, that all the married men &s;hould thus &s;uffer. <HI>A &s;trange peice of Divinity to me,</HI> that never before heard &s;uch preaching.

In the old English <HI>Ma&s;s-book,</HI> called <HI>Secundum u&s;um Sarum,</HI> the Woman at the time of marriage promi&s;eth her future Husband to be bon|ny and buxome at bed and at board till death us depart, &amp;c. This being too light for the gravity of the action then in hand; and in mine opinion &s;omewhat le&s;s reverent than a Church duty would require; the Reformers of that Book thought good to alter, and thought fitter to <HI>put in, to love, cheri&s;h and obey.</HI> That this was a &s;ufficient a&s;&s;urance of Conjugal faith he would not grant, becau&s;e the promi&s;e of being buxome in bed was excluded. Be&s;ides, he accounted the &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;hone&s;ty of the Engli&s;h Wives as a vengeance plucked down on the heads of the people, for chopping and changing the words of the holy Sacrament (for &s;uch they e&s;teem the form of Matrimony.) Though his argument needed no an&s;wer; yet his accu&s;ati|on might expect one. And an Engli&s;h Gentleman (though not of the Engli&s;h faith) laid open the abu&s;e, and &s;eemed to &s;peak it out of knowledge. When the <HI>Mon&s;ieurs</HI> came over full pur&s;ed to <HI>London,</HI> the French Pandars, which lay in wait for &s;uch booties, grow into their acquaintance, and promi&s;e them the imbraces of &s;uch a Dame of the City, or of &s;uch a Lady of the Court; Women per|haps famed for admirable beauties. But <HI>as</HI> Ixion <HI>among&s;t the Poets expected</HI> Juno&punc; <HI>and enjoyed a Cloud</HI>: So tho&s;e beguiled wretches, in&s;tead of tho&s;e

</ARGUMENT>
<P>I Have now done with the <HI>French</HI> both Men and Wome~: a people much extolled by many of the Engli&s;h Travellers for all tho&s;e graces which may enoble and adorn both Sexes: For my part, having ob&s;erved them as well as I could, and traced them
<PB N="67" REF="36">
in all their &s;everal humours, I &s;et up my re&s;t with this propo&s;ition, that <HI>there is nothing to be envied in them but their Country</HI>; To that indeed I am earn|e&s;tly, and I think not unworthily affected: here being nothing wanting which may be required to rai&s;e and reward ones liking. If Nature were ever prodigal of her ble&s;&s;ings, or &s;cattered them with an over-plentiful hand, it was in this I&s;land into which we were entred as &s;oon as we were pa&s;&s;ed over the bridge of <HI>Pontoi&s;e.</HI> The fir&s;t part of it, la&s;ting for three leagues, was upon the plain of a Mountain, but &s;uch a Mountain as will hardly yeild to the be&s;t Valley in <HI>Europe</HI> out of <HI>France.</HI> On both &s;ides of us the Vines grew up in a ju&s;t length, and promi&s;ed to the Husband-man a thriving vin|tage. The Wines they yeild are far better than tho&s;e of <HI>Normandy</HI> or <HI>Ga&s;coyne,</HI> and indeed the be&s;t in the whole Continent, tho&s;e of <HI>Orleans</HI> ex|cepted; yet what we &s;aw here was but as a bit to prepare our &s;tomacks, lea&s;t we &s;hould &s;urfeit in the Valley.</P>
<P>Here we beheld Nature in her riche&s;t ve&s;tments. The fields enterchangeably planted with Wheat and Vines: That had <HI>L. Florus</HI> once beheld it, he would never have given unto <HI>Campania</HI> the title of <HI>Cereris &amp; Bacchi certamen.</HI> The&s;e fields were di&s;|per&s;edly here and there be&s;et with Cherry-trees: which con&s;idered with the re&s;t gave unto the eye an excellent object. For the Vines yet green, the Wheat ready for the &s;ithe, and the Cherries now full ripened, and &s;hewing forth their beauty through the vail of the leaves, made &s;uch a various and delight&s;ome mixture of colours, that no art
<PB N="68" REF="37">
could have expre&s;&s;ed it &s;elf more delectable. If you have ever &s;een an exqui&s;ite Mo&s;aical work you may be&s;t judge of the beauty of this Valley. Add to this that the River <HI>Seine</HI> being now pa&s;t <HI>Paris,</HI> either to embrace that flouri&s;hing &s;oyl, or out of a wanton de&s;ire to play with it &s;elf, hath divided it &s;elf into &s;undry le&s;&s;er channels, be&s;ides its &s;everal windings and turnings: So that one may very ju&s;t|ly, and not irreligiou&s;ly conceive it to be an <HI>Idaea</HI> or <HI>repre&s;entation of the Garden of Eden</HI>; the River &s;o happily &s;eparating it &s;elf to water the ground. This Valley is a very large circuit. And as the Welch-men call <HI>Angle&s;ea Mon Mam Gymry,</HI> that is, <HI>the Mother of Wales</HI>: &s;o may we call this the <HI>Mother of Paris:</HI> for &s;o abundantly doth it furni&s;h that great and populous City, that when the <HI>Dukes</HI> of <HI>Bary</HI> and <HI>Burgundie</HI> be&s;ieged it with 100000. men, there being at that time three or 400000. Citizens and Souldiers within the wals, neither the people within, nor the enemy without, found any want of provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is called the Valley of <HI>Montmorencie,</HI> from the Town and Ca&s;tle of <HI>Montmorencie</HI> &s;eated in it. But this Town nameth not the Valley onely; it giveth name al&s;o to the ancient family of the <HI>Dukes</HI> of <HI>Montmorencie,</HI> the <HI>anciente&s;t hou&s;e of Chri&s;tendom.</HI> He &s;tiled him&s;elf <HI>Lepremier Chri&s;tien, &amp; plus vicil Baron du' France,</HI> and it is &s;aid, that his Ance&s;tors received the faith of Chri&s;t by the preaching of St. <HI>Denis</HI> the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop of <HI>Paris.</HI> Their princi|pal hou&s;es are that of <HI>Chantilly</HI> and <HI>Ecqucan,</HI> both &s;eated in the I&s;le: This la&s;t being given to this pre&s;ent Dukes Father by King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, to
<PB N="69" REF="37">
whom it was confi&s;cated by the condemnation of one of his Trea&s;urers. This hou&s;e al&s;o (and &s;o I beleive it) hath been ob&s;erved to have yeilded to <HI>France</HI> more <HI>Con&s;tables, Mar&s;hals, Admirals,</HI> and the like Officers of power and command than any three other in the whole Kingdom, in&s;omuch that I may &s;ay of it, what <HI>Irenicus</HI> doth of the <HI>Count Palatines,</HI> the names of the Countries onely chan|ged: <HI>Non alia Galliae e&s;t familia cui plus debent no|bilitus.</HI> The now Duke named <HI>Henry,</HI> is at this pre|&s;ent <HI>Admiral</HI> of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>The mo&s;t eminent place in all the I&s;le is <HI>Mont-Martyr,</HI> eminent I mean by rea&s;on of its height; though it hath al&s;o enough of antiquity to make it remarkable. It is &s;eated within a mile of <HI>Paris,</HI> high upon a Mountain, on which many of the faith|ful, during the time that <HI>Gaule</HI> was heatheni&s;h, were made <HI>Martyrs</HI>: Hence the name; though <HI>Paris</HI> was the place of apprehen&s;ion and &s;entence, yet was this Mountain commonly the Scaffold of execution: It being the cu&s;tom of the Ancients, <HI>neither to put to death, nor bury within the wals of their Cities.</HI> Thus the <HI>Jews</HI> when they crucified our Sa|viour, led him out of the City of <HI>Hieru&s;alem</HI> unto Mount <HI>Calvary</HI>: unto which St. <HI>Paul</HI> is thought to allude, <HI>Hebr.</HI> 13. &s;aying, <HI>Let us therefore go forth to him,</HI> &amp;c. Thus al&s;o doth St. <HI>Luke</HI> (to omit other in&s;tances) report of St. <HI>Stephen, Acts</HI> 7. <HI>And they ca&s;t him out of the City and &s;toned him.</HI> So in the State of <HI>Rome</HI>; the <HI>Ve&s;tal Virgin</HI> having committed fornication was &s;tifled in the <HI>Campus Sceleritatus</HI>; and other Malefactors thrown down the <HI>Tarpeian rock</HI>; both &s;cituate without the Town.
<PB N="70" REF="38">
So al&s;o had the <HI>The&s;&s;alians</HI> a place of execution from the praecipice of an hill, which they called the <GAP DESC="foreign"> or <HI>Corvi</HI>: whence aro&s;e the Proverb <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>be hanged.</HI> As they permitted not execu|tion of Malefactors within their wals: &s;o neither would they &s;uffer the be&s;t of their Citizens to be buried within them. This was it which made <HI>A|braham</HI> to buy him <HI>a field wherein to bury his dead</HI>: and thus we read in the &s;eventh of <HI>Luke,</HI> that the Widow of <HI>Naims</HI> Son was carried out to be buri|ed. This cu&s;tom al&s;o we find among the <HI>Athe|nians, Corinthians</HI> and other of the <HI>Graecians; qui inagris &s;uis</HI> (&s;aith <HI>Alexander ab Alexandro) aut in fundo &s;uburbano, ceuinavito aut patrio &s;olo cor|pora humari con&s;uevere.</HI> Among&s;t the <HI>Romans</HI> it was once the fa&s;hion to burn the bodies of their dead within their City. This continued till the bringing in of the <HI>Laws of Athens,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Laws of the twelve Tables</HI>: one of which Laws runneth in the&s;e words. <HI>In urbe ne &s;epelito, neve drito.</HI> After this prohibition their dead corps were fir&s;t <HI>burned in Campus Martius</HI>; and their Urnes covered in &s;undry places of the field. The frequent Urnes or &s;epulchral &s;tones digged up a|mong&s;t us here in <HI>England</HI> are &s;ufficient te&s;timo|nies of this a&s;&s;ertion. Be&s;ides we may find in <HI>Ap|pian,</HI> that the chief rea&s;on why the rich men in <HI>Rome</HI> would not yeild to the Law called <HI>Lex A|grariae</HI> (for that Law divided the Roman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons equally among the people) was, becau&s;e they thought it an irreligious thing, that the Monuments of their fore-fathers &s;hould be &s;old to others. The fir&s;t that is regi&s;tred to have been buried in the
<PB N="71" REF="38">
City was <HI>Trajane</HI> the Emperor. Afterward it was granted as an honorary to &s;uch as had de&s;erved well of the Republique. And when the Chri&s;tian Religion prevailed; and Church-yards, tho&s;e dor|mitories of the Saints were con&s;ecrated, the liber|ty of burying within the wals was to all equally granted.</P>
<P>On this ground it not being lawful to put to death or bury within the Town of <HI>Paris</HI>; this Mountain was de&s;tinate to the&s;e purpo&s;es: then was it onely a Mountain, now it is enlarged unto a Town. It hath a poor wall, an <HI>Abbey</HI> of <HI>Benedi|ctine Monks,</HI> and a Chappel called <HI>La Chapelle des Martyrs:</HI> both founded by <HI>Lewis</HI> the &s;ixth, called <HI>The Gro&s;s.</HI> Among&s;t others which received here the Crown of Martyrdom, none more famous than St. <HI>Denis</HI> (&s;aid to be <HI>Dioni&s;ius Areopagita</HI>) the fir&s;t Bi&s;hop of <HI>Paris: Ru&s;ticus</HI> his Arch-prei&s;t, and <HI>Eleutherius</HI> his Deacon.

Of St. <HI>Denis,</HI> being the <HI>Patron</HI> or <HI>Tutelary St. of France,</HI> the <HI>Legend</HI> reports &s;trange wonders, as namely, when the Exe|cutioner had &s;mitten off his head, he caught it be|tween his arms, and ran with it down the hill, as fa&s;t as his legs could bear him. Half a mile from the place of his execution he &s;ate down, re&s;ted, and &s;o he did nine times in all, even till he came to the place where his Church is now built. There he fell down and died, being <HI>three milee Engli&s;h from Mount Martyr</HI>; and there he was buried together
<PB N="72" REF="39">
with <HI>Ru&s;ticus</HI> and <HI>Eleutherius</HI>: who not being able to go as fa&s;t as he did, were brought after by the people. <HI>O impudentiam admirabilem &amp; ver&egrave; Ro|manam!</HI> and yet &s;o far was the &s;ucceeding age po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed with a beleif of this miracle, that in the nine &s;everal places, where he is &s;aid to have re&s;ted, &s;o many hand&s;om cro&s;&s;es of &s;tones there are erected: all of a making.</P>
<P>To the memory of this St. did <HI>Dagobert</HI> the fir&s;t build a Temple, and the times en&s;uing improved it to a Town. Afterwards in honour of St. <HI>Denis,</HI> and becau&s;e it lay near <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;ome of the follow|ing Kings be&s;towed a wall upon it. A wall it is of a large circuit, and very much unproportionable to the Town which &s;tandeth in it; for all the world <HI>like a Spaniards little face in his great ruffe</HI>: or like a &s;mall chop of Mutton in a large di&s;h of Pottage (at the three-penny ordinary.) Thus was the Town (as you &s;ee) built by means, but it was not &s;o with the Temple: unle&s;s that be worth a Mira|cle in the building and in the con&s;ecrating of it, I will not give a &s;traw for it. Thus then &s;aith the &s;tory: <HI>Dagobert</HI> afterwards King of <HI>France,</HI> during the life of <HI>Clotarre</HI> the &s;econd his Father, had cru|elly &s;lain <HI>Sadra&s;agille</HI> his Governor. To avoid the fury of his Father, much incen&s;ed with that un|princely action, he was compelled to wander up and down <HI>France,</HI> hungry and thir&s;ty: And as he went, and he went (for this tale &s;hould be told in the &s;ame &s;tile that Wenches tell theirs by the fires &s;ide) till he came to the <HI>Sepulcher of St. Denis</HI>; where he laid him&s;elf down and &s;lept: and then there appeared unto him a fine old man, with a
<PB N="73" REF="39">
&s;taffe in his hand, and he told him, that his Father was dead; and that he &s;hould be King: and he prayed him of all loves, that when he came to be King, he would build a <HI>Church</HI> there, <HI>to the honour of St. Denis.</HI> He had an hard heart, that could deny &s;o &s;weet an old man &s;o little a curte&s;ie for &s;o much good news: and I trow he was more kind than &s;o. And &s;o when the Church was built, the Bi&s;hop was &s;ent for in all ha&s;t to ble&s;s it. But it chanced the night before the day wherein the Bi|&s;hop was to ble&s;s it, there came to the Town an ugly Leper, and the foule&s;t that ever was &s;een. And this Leper would needs lie in the Church: and when he was there, about twelve a clock in the night our <HI>Saviour</HI> came to the Church in garments as white as the driven &s;now. There came with him the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI> the <HI>Angels,</HI> and the <HI>Martyrs,</HI> and the &s;weete&s;t mu&s;ick that ever was heard in the world. Then <HI>Chri&s;t ble&s;&s;ed the Church</HI>; and &s;aid unto the Leper, that he &s;hould tell the Bi&s;hop that the Church was already ble&s;&s;ed: and for a token of it, he gave the Leper his health: who pre&s;ently be|came as fine a &s;weet youth as one &s;hould &s;ee in a &s;ummers day. <HI>Auditam admi&s;&s;e ri&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">teneatis?</HI> you may laugh if you plea&s;e, but I will a&s;&s;ure you this is the &s;tory: Neither is it a jot the le&s;s authentical be|cau&s;e of the &s;tile.

<P>But (to omit the additions of the Legend) true it is, that <HI>Dagobert</HI> was the <HI>fir&s;t Founder</HI> of the Church: which was afterward rebuilt and beauti|fied by the twenty fifth Abbot of it, called <HI>Sugger,</HI> in the raign of King <HI>Lewis</HI> the &s;ixth. A reverent and comely Fabrick certainly it is: Dark, as the Churches of tho&s;e times commonly were, and none of the poore&s;t. It maintaineth &s;ixty two <HI>Monks</HI> and an <HI>Abbot,</HI> who&s;e &s;ingle revenue is thought to be <HI>worth ten thou&s;and Crowns</HI> and upward. The pre&s;ent Abbot is <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> Son to the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> a young Gentleman of &s;ome four|teen years of age, or thereabouts: but of him more hereafter. The Abbot of it, among many other priviledges, hath a full power upon the lives, goods, and honours of his va&s;&s;als; and hath a voice in the Parliament of <HI>Paris</HI> as full and binding as any of the Coun&s;ellors there &s;itting. As for the Church it &s;elf, it is in height eighty foot, an hundred in breadth, and in length three hundred. The <HI>high Altar,</HI> under which the bodies of Saint <HI>Denis</HI> and his two fellow Martyrs are &s;aid to be buried, is a very rich and excellent work: the <HI>Crucifix</HI> &s;tand|ing over it being all of pure gold, embos'd with divers pearls and pretious &s;tones of great value. Before it hangeth a &s;ilver Lamp continually burning; and if you look about it, you &s;hall &s;ee the riche&s;t and the faire&s;t gla&s;s for painting in all <HI>France,</HI> that of <HI>Amiens</HI> onely excepted; one thing I will further note in this Church, before I come to

And then once more <HI>re-embo&s;om'd him&s;elf in the Roman Sy|nagogue,</HI> which was the time we now &s;peak of. <HI>Quo teneam nodo mutantem protea vultum</HI>? the onely <HI>Proteus</HI> in matters of faith of our times, Doctor <HI>Perne,</HI> was a diamond to him.</P>

His tongue ran &s;o fa&s;t, that the quicke&s;t eye there was fain to give him over in plain ground: the fellow that &s;heweth the <HI>Tombs</HI> at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> being no more to be compared to him for the volubility of his chops, than a <HI>Capouchin</HI> to a <HI>Je&s;uite</HI>: yet as we learned af|terwards of him, when he was out of his road, they were thus di&s;po&s;ed. On the right hand of the Altar (not that high Altar above mentioned) there are

And fiftly, the <HI>Reliques of St. Lewis</HI> re&s;erved in a little Chappel, all of gold al&s;o, and built after the fa&s;hion of <HI>No&s;tre-dame</HI> in <HI>Paris.</HI> On the left there was &s;hewed us the <HI>head of St. Denis,</HI> and a part of his body: But I mi&s;take my &s;elf, it was not the head, but the Portraiture in gold; the head being &s;aid to be within it.

On each &s;ide of the head are two Angels &s;upporting it, reported to be the work of one <HI>Ely Le plus arti&s;te orfeure de &s;on temps</HI>: the cunning&s;t Gold-&s;mith of his time, who afterwards was made Bi&s;hop of <HI>Noyon</HI> and Sainted.</P>
<P>Concerning Reliques I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak further, when I come to the <HI>holy Chappel in Paris</HI>: &s;omewhat now of the honour due unto the memory of Martyrs. I am none of tho&s;e that think the memories of tho&s;e Heroes of the Primi|tive times not to be honoured in the du&s;t. Neither would I a&s;&s;ault their &s;hrines with an irreverent fin|ger. On the other &s;ide, they &s;hall never have my prayers directed to them, nor my devotions: nor can I think it lawful to give the remnants of them any bodily ob&s;ervance: though I do and will ho|nour, yet I dare not wor&s;hip them.

<P>From the <HI>Reliques of Martyrs,</HI> proceed we to tho&s;e of <HI>Kings,</HI> and among&s;t tho&s;e there is nothing which will long detain an Engli&s;h man.

A fine contrived hou&s;e it &s;eemed to be; but our journey lay beyond it: One league beyond it lay <HI>Ruall,</HI> a &s;mall Town belonging to the Abbey of St. <HI>Denis.</HI> In the corner of this Town, the <HI>Queen Mother</HI> hath a fine &s;ummer hou&s;e, abundantly adorned with re|tired walks, and a mo&s;t curious variety of Water-works: For be&s;ides the forms of divers gla&s;&s;es, pil|lars and geometrical figures, all framed by the wa|ter, there were birds of &s;undry forts &s;o artificially made, that they both deceived the eye by their mo|tion, and the ear by their melody: Somewhat higher, in the mid&s;t of a mo&s;t delicious garden, are two <HI>Fountains</HI> of admirable workman&s;hip. In the fir&s;t the Portraitures of <HI>Cerberus,</HI> the <HI>Bore</HI> of <HI>Calidon,</HI> the <HI>Naemean Lyon,</HI> and in the navel of it <HI>Hercules</HI> killing <HI>Hydra.</HI> In the other onely a <HI>Crocodile</HI> full of wild and unruly tricks, and &s;end|ing from his throat a mu&s;ick not far different from Organs. Had your eyes been &s;hut, you would have thought your &s;elf in &s;ome Cathedral Church: this melody of the <HI>Crocodile,</HI> and that other of the Birds, &s;o exactly counterfeiting the harmony of a well ordered Quire. And now we are come into the <HI>Grove,</HI> a place &s;o full of retired walks, &s;o &s;weetly and delectably contrived, that they would even en|tice a man to melancholy; becau&s;e in them even melancholy would &s;eem delightful. The trees &s;o interchangeably folded the one within the other, that they were at once a &s;helter again&s;t wind and &s;un, yet not not &s;o &s;ullenly clo&s;e, but that they af|forded the eye an excellent Lord&s;hip over the

It &s;eemed a Grove, an Orchard, and a Vine|yard, &s;o variou&s;ly enterwoven and mixed together, as if it had been the purpo&s;e of the Arti&s;t to make a man fall in love with confu&s;ion. In the middle of the wilderne&s;s was &s;eated the <HI>hou&s;e,</HI> environed round about with a moat of running water; the hou&s;e pretty and therefore little, built rather for a banquet than a fea&s;t. It was built and thus enrich|ed with variety of plea&s;ures by <HI>Mr. de Ponte</HI> Tay|lor to King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and was, no que&s;tion, the be&s;t garment he ever cut out in his life.

<P>Two leagues from <HI>Ruall</HI> is the Kings hou&s;e of St. <HI>Germanenly,</HI> an hou&s;e &s;eated on the top of an hill, ju&s;t like <HI>Wind&s;ore.</HI> The Town of St. <HI>Germain</HI> lyeth all round about it: the River <HI>Reine</HI> (of the &s;ame breadth as the <HI>Thames</HI> is at the place mentioned) runneth below it; and the hou&s;e, by rea&s;on of the &s;cite, having a large command of the Country round about it.

The principal was the maje&s;ty of the hou&s;e, which is indeed worth the ob&s;erva|tion. The Palace of the <HI>Lou're</HI> &s;o much famed, is not to be named the &s;ame day with that. The rooms are well ordered and well roofed: gorgeou&s;ly &s;et out with the curio&s;ity of the Painter. In &s;ome of the Chambers they &s;hewed us &s;ome poetical ficti|ons, expre&s;&s;ed by the pencil in the windows, and on the wain&s;cot, and &s;eemed to glory much in them. I confe&s;s they might plentifully have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed my fancy, had I not &s;een the Window in <HI>Gorrambury</HI> gallery, belonging to the right Honorable <HI>Francis Vi&s;count St. Albons,</HI> a Window, in which all the <HI>Fables</HI> of <HI>Ovid</HI>'s <HI>Metamorpho&s;is</HI> are &s;o naturally and lively re&s;embled, that if ever Art went beyond it &s;elf, it was in that admirable expre&s;&s;ion.</P>

unquiet Bea&s;t, that vomiteth on all that come nigh it. At the end toward the right hand is the &s;tatue of a <HI>Nymph</HI> &s;itting before a pair of Organs. Upon the loo&s;ing of one of the pipes the Nymphs fin|gers began to manage the keys, and brought the in&s;trument to yeild &s;uch a mu&s;ick, that if it were not that of an Organ, it was like it as could be, and not be the &s;ame: Unto the divi&s;ion of her fingers her head kept a proportionable time, jolting from one &s;houlder to the other: as I have &s;een an old Fid|ler at a Wake. In the &s;ame partition were the coun|terfeits of all &s;orts of mils, w^c^h before very eagerly di&s;charged their functions, but upon the beginning of the harmony they &s;uddenly &s;tood &s;till, as if they had ears to have heard it. At the other end toward the left hand we &s;aw a &s;hop of Smiths, another of Joyners, and back&s;ides full of Sawyers and Ma|&s;ons, all idle: upon the fir&s;t command of the water they all fell to their occupations, and plied them lu&s;tily: the Birds every where by their &s;inging &s;a|ving the Artificers the labour of whi&s;tling. Be&s;ides upon the drawing of a wooden curtain, there ap|peared unto us two <HI>Tritons</HI> riding on their Dol|phins, and each of them with a &s;hell in his hand, which interchangeably and in turns &s;erved them in+&s;tead of Trumpets.

But withall it was &s;o cunningly mannaged, and that with &s;uch mutual change of fortune on the parts of both the Com|batants, that one who had not known the Fable, would have been &s;ore afraid, that the Knight would have lo&s;t the victory, and the Lady her life. At the other end there was &s;hewed unto us,

I &s;ay, there appeared unto us the re&s;emblance of <HI>Orpheus</HI> playing on a treble Violl; the trees mo|ving with the force of the mu&s;ick, and the wild Bea&s;ts dancing in two rings about him. An inven|tion which could not but co&s;t King <HI>Henry</HI> a great &s;um of money; one &s;tring of the Fiddle being by mi&s;chance broken, having co&s;t King <HI>Lewis</HI> his Son 1500. Livers. Upon the opening of a double leafed door, there were exhibited unto us divers repre&s;entations and conceits: which certainly might have been more graceful, if they had not had &s;o much in them of a Pudpet-play.

As for the Etymology of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> who derived the name from <HI>Paris</HI> one of the Kings of <HI>Celtae,</HI> it may (for ought that I know) de&s;ervedly keep company with that of <HI>Bero&s;us</HI> already recited.

For figure it is <HI>circular</HI>; that being (according to the <HI>Geome|tricians</HI>) of all figures the mo&s;t capacious. And que&s;tionle&s;s if it be true that <HI>&V;rbs non in maenibus &s;ed in civibus po&s;ita e&s;t, Paris</HI> may chalenge as great a circuit, as the mo&s;t of <HI>Europe</HI>; it being little inferiour to the bigge&s;t for the multitude of her inhabitants. Joyn the compa&s;s and the populou&s;|ne&s;s together, and you &s;hall hear the wi&s;e&s;t of the <HI>French</HI> men &s;ay, <HI>Que ce qu'e&s;t l' ame a la rai|&s;en, et la prunet a locit, cela me&s;me e&s;t Paris a la France.</HI> Adde to this the virdict of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, who being demanded which he thought to be the bigge&s;t <HI>City of France,</HI> an&s;wered <HI>Roven:</HI> and being then asked what he though of <HI>Paris,</HI> made an&s;wer, <HI>&V;n P&agrave;is,</HI> that it was a whole Coun|try;

the <HI>Emperour</HI> did well to flatter <HI>Francis</HI> the fir&s;t, who asked him the&s;e que&s;tions, and in who&s;e power he then was: otherwi&s;e he might have gi|ven men good cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect his judgement. The truth is that <HI>Paris</HI> is a fayr and goodly Town, yet withal it is no thing like the miracle that &s;ome make it. Were the figure of <HI>London</HI> altered, and all the hou&s;es of it ca&s;t into a ring, I dare able it a <HI>larger and more goodly Town than Paris,</HI> and that in the compari&s;on, it may give it at the lea&s;t half a mile oddes.</P>
<P>For matter of &s;trength and re&s;i&s;tance certain it is, that this <HI>City</HI> is exceeding well &s;eated, were it as well fortified. It lyeth in a plain flat and levell, and hath no hills nigh unto it, from which it can any way be annoyed: and for the ca&s;ting and making of rowling Trenches, I think the &s;oyle is hardly &s;erviceable. If Art were no more wanting to the &s;trengh of it than Nature, in mine opinion it might be made almo&s;t impregnable. <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, &s;eeing the pre&s;ent weakne&s;s of it, had once a purpo&s;e (as it is &s;aid) to have &s;trenthened it according to the moderne Art of fortifications: but it went no further than the purpo&s;e. He was a great builder, and had may projects of Ma&s;onry in his head, which were little for his profit; and this would have proved le&s;s than any: for be&s;ides the infinite &s;ums of money, which would have been employed in &s;o immen&s;e a work; what had this been in effect, but to put a &s;word into a mad mans hand. The oft mutinies and &s;editions of this people hath made it little inferiour to <HI>Laigh,</HI> or <HI>Gaunt,</HI> the two mo&s;t revolting Townes in <HI>Eu|rope.</HI>
<PB N="90" REF="48">
And again, the <HI>Baracadoes</HI> again&s;t the per|&s;on of <HI>King Henry</HI> the third, and the long re&s;i&s;t|ance it made to him&s;elf being weak, were &s;ufficient to in&s;truct him, what might be expected from it by his <HI>Succe&s;&s;ors,</HI> when it &s;hould be &s;trengthened and enabled to rebellion.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;trength of the Town then is not great, the walles being very weak and ruinous; and tho&s;e other few helps which it hath being little available for defence. The beautifulle&s;t part of the whole re&s;i&s;tance is the Ditch, deep, praecipitate, and broad; and to &s;ay no more of it, an excellent ward were there any thing el&s;e corre&s;pondent to it. As for the <HI>Fort</HI> next to St. <HI>Antonies</HI> gate called the <HI>Ba&s;tille,</HI> it is in my con|ceit too little to protect the Town, and too low to command it. When Swords onely and Pick-axes were in u&s;e, and afterwards in the infancy of Gunnes, it did &s;ome &s;ervice in the Nature of of a <HI>Fortre&s;&s;e</HI>; now it onely &s;erveth as a <HI>Pri&s;on,</HI> principally for tho&s;e of the greater &s;ort, who will permit them&s;elves to be taken. It is &s;aid to be built by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> when they were <HI>Lords of Paris:</HI> and the <HI>Vulgar</HI> are all of this opinion. O|thers of the more learned &s;ort, make it to be the work of one of the <HI>Provosts</HI> of the <HI>City Du Che&s;ne</HI> calleth him <HI>Hugues Ambriott,</HI> in the time of <HI>Char|les</HI> the fifth, when as yet the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had nothing to do here. The word <HI>Ba&s;tille</HI> in general is a <HI>Fortre&s;&s;e</HI>; the article <HI>la</HI> prefixed before it maketh it a name, and appropriateth it to this building. There are al&s;o two little turrets ju&s;t again&s;t the Gallery of the <HI>Louure</HI> on both &s;ides of the <HI>Seine,</HI>

intended for the defence of the River; though now they are little able to an&s;wer that intention. They al&s;o are fathered on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>; but how true I know not. Another place I marked, de|&s;igned perhaps for a <HI>Rampart,</HI> but employed on|ly at this time by Wind-mills: it is a goodly mount of earth, high and capacious, &s;cituate clo&s;e unto the gate called <HI>St. Martin,</HI> the mo&s;t defen&s;ible part (if well manned) of all <HI>Paris.</HI> Thus is the &s;trength of this Town (as you &s;ee) but &s;mall, and if <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, lay &s;o long before it with his Army, it was not becau&s;e he could not take it, but becau&s;e he would not: <HI>He was loath</HI> (as <HI>By|ron</HI> advi&s;ed him,) <HI>to receive the bird naked,</HI> which he expected with all his feathers: and this an&s;wer he gave to my Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> who undertook to force an entry into it.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Streets</HI> they are made of a lawfull and competent bredth, well pitched under the foot with fair and large Pebble: This paving of it was the work of <HI>Philip Augu&s;tus, Anno</HI> 1223. or there|bouts: before which time it could not but be mi|&s;erably dirty, if not unpa&s;&s;able. As it now is, the lea&s;t <HI>rain maketh it very &s;lippery and trouble|&s;ome,</HI> and as little a continuance of <HI>warm wea|ther, &s;tinking and poi&s;ononus:</HI> But whether this noy&s;omne&s;s proceed from the nature of the ground, or the &s;lutti&s;hne&s;s of the people in their hou&s;es, or the neglect of the Magi&s;trates in not providing a &s;ufficiency of <HI>Scavingers,</HI> or all, I am not to determine. This I am confident of, that the <HI>nastie&s;t Lane in London, is Frankincen&s;e and Juniter to the &s;weete&s;t Street in this City.</HI> The an|cient

by-word was (and there is good rea&s;on for it) <HI>Il de&s;taint come la fange de Paris.</HI> Had I the power of making Proverbs, I would only change <HI>Il de&s;taint, into Il puit,</HI> and make the <HI>by-word</HI> ten times more Orthodoxe. I have &s;poken &s;omewhat of the <HI>Fortifications</HI> of this Town, but they are but triflles: the only <HI>venome</HI> of the Streets is a &s;trength unto it more powerful, than the ditches or the Bullwark of <HI>St. Martin, Mori&s;on</HI> in his <HI>Itinera|ry</HI> relateth how the <HI>Citizens</HI> of <HI>Prague in Bohe|mia</HI> were reparing the walls of the Town for fear of the <HI>Turks</HI>: but withal he addeth, that if the &s;tink of the Streets kept him not thence, there was a&s;&s;urance to be looked for of the walls: I know not now how true it is of that <HI>City</HI>; I am &s;ure it may be ju&s;tly verified upon this. It was therefore not injudiciou&s;ly &s;aid of an <HI>Engli&s;h Gen|tleman,</HI> that he thought <HI>Paris</HI> was the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t Town in Chri&s;tendome</HI>: for he took &s;trong in that &s;en&s;e, as we do in <HI>England,</HI> when we &s;ay, &s;uch a man hath a &s;trong breath. The&s;e things con&s;i|dered, it could not but be an infinite happine&s;se granted by Nature to our <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, that he never &s;topped his no&s;e at any &s;tink, as our <HI>Chro|nicles</HI> report of him; otherwi&s;e in my con&s;cience he had never been able to have kept his <HI>Court</HI> here. But that which mo&s;t amazeth me is, that in &s;uch a perpetuated con&s;tancy of &s;tinks, there &s;hould yet be found, &s;o large and admirable a va|riety; a variety &s;o &s;pecifical and di&s;tinct, that any <HI>Chymicall</HI> no&s;e (I dare lay my life on it) after two or three perambulations, would hunt out blindfold each &s;everal &s;treet by the &s;mell; as per|fectly

<P>For the <HI>Buildings,</HI> they are I confe&s;s very hand|&s;omly and uniformly &s;et out to the &s;treet ward; not un&s;eemly in them&s;elves and very &s;uitable one with another: high and perpendicular, with windowes reaching almo&s;t from the top to the bottome. The hou&s;es of the new mould in <HI>London</HI> are ju&s;t after their fa&s;hion, wherein the care and de&s;igne of our late <HI>Soveraigne King James,</HI> is highly to be magnified. Time and his good beginnings well &s;econded will make that City nothing inferiour for the beauty and excellency of her &s;tructures, to the gallante&s;t of <HI>Europe.</HI> In&s;omuch that he might truly have &s;aid of his <HI>London</HI> what <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> did of his <HI>Rome.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign">: as <HI>Dyon</HI> hath it, <HI>&V;rbem quam la|teritiam inveni marmoreum relenquo.</HI> But as <HI>Lon|don</HI> now is, the hou&s;es of it in the in&s;ide are both better contrived, and more richly furni&s;hed by farre, than tho&s;e of <HI>Paris</HI>: the inward beautie and ornaments mo&s;t commonly following the e|&s;tate of the builders or owners. Their hou&s;es are di&s;tingui&s;hed by Signes, as with us, and under every &s;igne there is printed in Capital Letters what &s;igne it is: neither is it more than needs. The old &s;hift off, This is a <HI>Cock,</HI> and This is a <HI>Bull,</HI> was never more requi&s;ite in the infancy of Painting, than in this City, for &s;o hideou&s;ly, and &s;o without re&s;emblance to the thing &s;ignified, are mo&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Pencill Works,</HI> that I may without

<P>And indeed generally the <HI>Artificers</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> are as &s;lovenly in their Trades, as in their hou&s;es; yet you may find nimble dancers, pretty Fidlers for a toy, and a Taylor that can trick you up after the be&s;t and newe&s;t fa&s;hion. Their Cutlers make &s;uch abominable and fearfull knives as would grieve a mans heart to &s;ee them; and the Glovers are wor&s;e than they: you would imagine by their Gloves, that the hand for which they were made were cut off by the wre&s;t; yet on the other &s;ide, they are very perfect at Tooth-picks, Beard-bru|&s;hes, and (which I hold the mo&s;t commendable Art of them) the cutting of a Seal. Their Mer|cers are but one degree removed from a Pedler; &s;uch as in <HI>England</HI> we call <HI>Chapmen</HI>; that is, a Pedler with a &s;hop: and for <HI>Gold&s;miths</HI> there is little u&s;e for them, Gla&s;&s;es there being mo&s;t in re|que&s;t; both becau&s;e neat and becau&s;e cheap: I per&s;wade my &s;elf that the two &s;everal ranks of &s;hops in <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> can &s;how more Plate, and more variety of Mercery warres, good and rich, than three parts of <HI>Paris.

What the e&s;tates of &s;ome of the wealthie&s;t Citizens may amount to, I cannot &s;ay: yet I dare conjecture it not to be &s;u|perfluous. The Author of the Book entitled <HI>Les e&s;tats du monde</HI> reckoneth it for a great mer|vail, that &s;ome of our <HI>London Merchants</HI> &s;hould be worth 100000. <HI>Crownes</HI>: we account that e|&s;tate among&s;t us not to be &s;o wonderful; and may hence &s;afely conclude, that they which made a Prodegy of &s;o little, are not much worth them&s;elves.</P>

<P>WE have di&s;charged the <HI>King</HI> of one <HI>Pallace,</HI> and mu&s;t follow him to the other, where we &s;hall find his re&s;idence.

An Hou&s;e of great fame, and which the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>France</HI> have long kept their <HI>Courts</HI> in. It was fir&s;t built by <HI>Phillip Augu&s;tus, anno</HI> 1214. and by him intended for a Ca&s;tle, it then &s;erving to impri&s;on the more <HI>potent of the Noble&s;&s;e,</HI> and to

lay up the <HI>Kings</HI> Trea&s;ury; for that cau&s;e it was well moated and &s;trengthened with walls and draw Bridges, very &s;erviceable in tho&s;e times. It had the name of <HI>Louure qua&s;i L'oeuure,</HI> or the work: the Building by way of excellencie. An <HI>Etymologie</HI> which draweth nigher to the ear than the under&s;tanding, or the eye. And yet the <HI>French</HI> writers would make it a miracle: <HI>Du Che&s;ne</HI> cal|leth it <HI>&s;uperbe ba&s;timent qui n' a &s;on e&s;gal en toute la Chri&s;tiente</HI>: and you &s;hall hear it called in ano|ther place, <HI>Ba&s;timent qui pa&s;&s;e muiourd huy en ex|cellenee et en grandeur, tous les autres.</HI> Brave <HI>E|ligies,</HI> if all were Gold that gli&s;tered.

This Hou&s;e, and the large fame it hath in the world is the <HI>Morall</HI> of it. Never was there an Hou&s;e more un&s;uitable to it &s;elf in the particular examination of parts, nor more un&s;u|table to the Character and e&s;teem of it in the ge|neral &s;urvey of the whole.</P>
<P>You enter into it over two <HI>Draw-bridges</HI>; and thorough three <HI>Gates,</HI> ruinous enough and abun|dantly un&s;ightly. In the <HI>Quadrangle</HI> you meet with three &s;everal fa&s;hions of buildings, of three &s;everal ages; and they &s;o unhappily joyned one to the other, that one would half beleeve they were clapped together by an <HI>Earthquake.</HI> The <HI>South</HI> and <HI>We&s;t</HI> parts of it are new, and indeed <HI>Prince like,</HI> being the work of <HI>Francis</HI> the fir&s;t, and his Son <HI>Henry</HI>: had it been all ca&s;t into the &s;ame mould, I per&s;wade my &s;elf, that it would be very gratious and lovely.

As for the in&s;ide it is farre more graceful, and would be plea&s;ing at the entrance, were the <HI>Gaurd Chamber</HI> reformed. Some <HI>Hugonot Architect</HI> which were not in love with the errours of Antiquity, might make a pret|ty room of it: a <HI>Catholick Carpenter</HI> would never get credit by it; for whereas the provident thrift

of our fore fathers intended it (for the Hou&s;e would el&s;e be too narrow for the <HI>Kings</HI> retinue) both for a room of &s;afety and of plea&s;ure, both for <HI>Bellmen</HI> and <HI>Dancers</HI>; and for that cau&s;e made up &s;ome &s;ix ranks of &s;eats on each &s;ide.

A dainty invention, and happily expre&s;|&s;ed. At the further end of it &s;tand the la&s;t <HI>King,</HI> and the pre&s;ent <HI>Queen Mother,</HI> who fill up the whole room. The &s;ucceeding <HI>Princes,</HI> if they mean to live in their pictures, mu&s;t either build new places for them, or el&s;e make u&s;e of the Long Gallery built by <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and which o|peneth in to that of the <HI>Queen Mother.</HI> A Galle|ry it is of an incredible length, as being above 500. yards long, and of a breadth and height not un|proportionable.

For my part I dare be of the la&s;t mind, as well becau&s;e the &s;econd is in part begun, as al&s;o con&s;idering how infinitely this <HI>King</HI> was affected to building. The place <HI>Daulphin,</HI> and the place <HI>Royal,</HI> two of the fine&s;t piles of <HI>Paris,</HI> were erected partly by his pur&s;e, but principally by his encouragement. The new <HI>Bridge</HI> in <HI>Paris</HI> was meerly his work; &s;o was al&s;o the new <HI>Palace,</HI> and the mo&s;t admirable <HI>Water-Works of St. Germanen|lay</HI>; this long <HI>Gallery</HI> and the <HI>Pe&s;thou&s;e</HI> owe them|&s;elves wholly unto him, and the hou&s;e of <HI>Fountain bleau,</HI> which is the faire&s;t in <HI>France,</HI> is beholding to him for mo&s;t of its beauty. Adde to this his fortifications be&s;towed on the <HI>Ba&s;tile,</HI> and his pur|po&s;e to have &s;trengthened <HI>Paris</HI> according to the modern art of Towns, and you will find the attri|bute of <HI>Parietaria</HI> or <HI>Wall-floure,</HI> which <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> &s;coffingly gave unto <HI>Trajane</HI> for his great humour of building, to be due unto this <HI>King,</HI> but &s;eriou&s;ly and with reverence.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the general love he had to building, h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> had al&s;o an ambition to go beyond en&s;ample, which al&s;o induceth me further to beleive his in|tent of making that large and admirable quadran|gle above &s;poken of, to have been &s;erious and real.

<P><PB N="160" REF="83">THe <HI>King</HI> is the &s;oul of the Court, without his pre&s;ence it is but a Carca&s;s, a thing without life and honour. I dare not &s;o farre wrong the <HI>Louure,</HI> as to make it but a common hou&s;e, and rob it of the fruition of its <HI>Prince,</HI> and therefore will treat of him here; though during my aboad in <HI>France</HI> he lay all the while in <HI>Fountain Bleau</HI>: For per&s;on he is of the middle &s;tature, and rather well proportioned than large. His face knoweth little yet of a beard, but that which is, is black and &s;war|thy; his complexion al&s;o much of the &s;ame heiw, carrying in it a certain boy&s;terou&s;ne&s;s, and that in a further mea&s;ure than what a graceful Maje&s;ty can admit of: So that one can hardly &s;ay of him with|out a &s;pice of Court&s;hip, what <HI>Paterculus</HI> did of <HI>Tiberius, Quod vi&s;us praetulerit principem,</HI> that his countenance proclaimed him a <HI>King.</HI> But que&s;ti|onle&s;s his greate&s;t defect is want of utterance, which is very unplea&s;ing by rea&s;on of a de&s;perate and un|curable &s;tammering, which defect is likely more and more to grow upon him. At this time he is aged twenty four years, and as much as &s;ince the 27 day of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, which was his birth day, an age which he beareth not very plau&s;ibly; want of beard and the &s;warthine&s;s of his complexion ma|king him &s;eem elder. At the age of eleven years he was affianced to the <HI>Lady Anna Infanta of Spain,</HI> by whom as yet he hath no children.

But this being not &s;ufficient to &s;ecure their fears, it is thought that &s;he was &s;ome way or other di&s;abled from conception, before ever &s;he came into the <HI>Kings</HI> embraces: A great crime I confe&s;s if true: yet I cannot &s;ay with <HI>Tully</HI> in his defence of <HI>Li|garius: Novum crimen Caie Cae&s;ar, &amp; hec tempus mauditum.

The <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Alby</HI> in <HI>Languedoc</HI> is prized at 100000. <HI>Florens,</HI> which is a fourth part of it, a great part of the revenue ari&s;ing out of Saffron. The <HI>Abbot</HI> of <HI>Clumac</HI> in the <HI>Dutchy</HI> of <HI>Burgundy</HI> is &s;aid to be worth 50000 Crowns yearly, the pre|&s;ent <HI>Abbot</HI> being <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Lorreine, Archbi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Rhemes</HI> and <HI>Abbot</HI> of <HI>St. Denis.</HI> The Pari&s;h <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> of <HI>St. E&s;tiennes</HI> is judged to receive yearly no fewer than eight thou&s;and Crowns, a good intra|do. As for the vulgar Clergy, they have little tithe, and le&s;s glebe; mo&s;t part of that Revenue being appropriated unto <HI>Abbies</HI> and other religious Hou&s;es. The greate&s;t part of their meanes is the <HI>Bai&s;emen,</HI> which is the Church offerings of the people at <HI>Chri&s;tnings, Marriages, Burials, Dirges, Indulgences</HI> and the like, which is thought to a|mount to almo&s;t as much as the temporal e&s;tate of the Church: An <HI>Income</HI> able to maintain them in good abundance, were it not for the greatne&s;s of their number. For reckoning that there are (as we have &s;aid) in <HI>France</HI> one hundred and thirty thou&s;and Pari&s;h <HI>Prie&s;ts,</HI> and that there are onely twenty &s;even thou&s;and four hundred Pari&s;hes, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be, that every Prri&s;h, one with
<PB N="181" REF="93">
another, hath no fewer than four Prie&s;ts, too many to be rich.</P>
<P>But this were one of the lea&s;t injuries offered to the <HI>French,</HI> thrift, and would little hinder them from ri&s;ing, if it were not, that the goodlie&s;t of their preferments are before their faces given unto Boyes and Children. An affront, which not onely de&s;paireth them of the honours due unto their cal|lings, but di&s;hearteneth them in their &s;tudies, and by con&s;equence draweth them to debauched and &s;landerous cour&s;es.
<Q><L>&mdash; Quis emim virtutem exquireret ip&s;am.</L>

The Clergy therefore, <HI>Anno</HI> 1617. being a&s;&s;embled at the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tin Friers</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> (as every two years they u&s;e to do) being to take their leaves of the <HI>King,</HI> elected the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Aire</HI> to be their <HI>Spoke&s;man,</HI> and to certifie his Maje&s;ty of their greivances. In performing which bu&s;ine&s;s, the principal thing of which he &s;pake was to this pur|po&s;e. That whereas his Maje&s;ty was bound to give them <HI>Fathers,</HI> he gave them Children; that the name of <HI>Abbot</HI> &s;ignifieth a <HI>Father,</HI> and the fun|ction of a <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> was full of fatherly authority, yet <HI>Erance</HI> notwith&s;tanding was now filled with <HI>Bi|&s;hops</HI> and <HI>Abbots</HI> which are yet in their Nur&s;es arms, or el&s;e under their Regents in Colledges. Nay more, that the abu&s;e goeth before the being, Children being commonly de&s;igned to <HI>Bi&s;hopricks</HI> &amp; <HI>Abbacies</HI> before they were born. He al&s;o made another Complaint, that the Sovereign Courts by
<PB N="182" REF="94">
their decrees had attempted upon the authority which was committed to the <HI>Clergy,</HI> even in that which concerned meerly <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> di&s;cipline and government of the Church. To the&s;e Com|plaints he gave them indeed a very gratious hear|ing, but it never went further than a hearing, being never followed by redre&s;s. The Court of Parlia|ment knew too well the &s;trength of their own au|thority, and the <HI>King</HI> was loath to take from him|&s;elf tho&s;e excellent advantages of binding to him|&s;elf his Nobility, by the &s;peedy preferring of their Children: And &s;o the Clergy departed with a great deal of envy, and a little of &s;atisfacti|on.</P>
<P>Like enough it were, that the <HI>Pope</HI> would in part redre&s;s this injury, e&s;pecially in the point of <HI>Juri&s;|diction,</HI> if he were able, but his wings are &s;hrewdly clipped in this Country, neither can he flie at all, but as farre as they plea&s;e to &s;uffer him. For his temporal power, they never could be induced to ac|knowledge it, as we &s;ee in their &s;tories, <HI>Anno</HI> 1610. the <HI>Divines</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> in a Declaration of theirs tender'd to the <HI>Queen Mother,</HI> affirm the &s;upre|macy of the <HI>Pope</HI> to be an erroneus doctrine, and the ground of that helli&s;h po&s;ition of depo&s;ing and killing of <HI>Kings. Anno</HI> 1517. when the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Luteram</HI> had determined the <HI>Pope</HI> to be the Head of the <HI>Church</HI> in cau&s;es al&s;o temporal, the <HI>&V;univer&s;ity</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> te&s;tified again&s;t it, in an <HI>Apoligie</HI> of theirs dated the twelfth of <HI>March</HI> the &s;ame year. <HI>Leo decimus</HI> (&s;aith the <HI>Apologie) in quidam coetu non tamen in &s;piritu Domini congrega|to, contra fidem Catholicam &amp;c. &s;acrum Ba&s;ilien&s;e
<PB N="183" REF="94">
Concilium damnavit</HI>; In which Councill of <HI>Ba&s;ill,</HI> the &s;upremacy of the <HI>Pope</HI> was condemned. Nei|ther did the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>France</HI> forget to maintain their own authority: And therefore whereas <HI>Pope Boniface</HI> the eighth, had in a peremptory Letter Written to <HI>Phillip le Belle King</HI> of <HI>France</HI> &s;tiled him&s;elf, <HI>Dominus totius Mundi tam in tem|poralibus quam in &s;piritualibus</HI>: the <HI>King</HI> returned him an an&s;wer with an <HI>Epithite</HI> &s;utable to his ar|rogancy: <HI>Sciat maxima tua fatuitas nos intempora|libus alicui non &s;ube&s;&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. The like an&s;wer though in mode&s;ter termes, was &s;ent to another of the <HI>Popes</HI> by <HI>St. Lewis</HI>; a man of a mo&s;t mild and &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition, yet unwilling to forgoe his Royalties.</P>
<P>His &s;piritual power is almo&s;t as little in &s;ub|&s;tance, though more in &s;hew; for whereas the <HI>Councill</HI> of <HI>Trent</HI> hath been an e&s;peciall authorizer of the <HI>Popes</HI> &s;piritual &s;upremacy; the <HI>French</HI> Church never would receive it: by this means the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> keep in their hands their own full au|thority, whereof an obedience to the decrees of that <HI>Councill</HI> would deprive them. It was truly &s;aid by <HI>St. Gregory,</HI> and they well knew it: Lib. 7. Epi&s;t. 70. <HI>Si unus univer&s;alis e&s;t, re&s;tat ut vos Epi&s;copinon Sitis.</HI> Further the <HI>&V;niver&s;ity</HI> of <HI>Pa|ris</HI> in their Declaration <HI>Anno</HI> 1610. above menti|oned, plainly affirme that it is directly oppo&s;ite to the doctrine of the Church, which the <HI>&V;niver|&s;ity</HI> of <HI>Paris</HI> hath alwaies maintained; that the <HI>Pope</HI> hath power of a Monarch in the &s;piritual Government of the Church. To look upon higher times, when the <HI>Councill</HI> of <HI>Con&s;tance</HI> had &s;ubmit|ted
<PB N="184" REF="95">
the authority of the <HI>Pope,</HI> unto that of a <HI>Councill.

<P>Put the principal thing, in which it behooveth them not to acknowledge his &s;piritual &s;upremacy is the Collation of <HI>Benefices</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;hopricks,</HI> and the <HI>Annates</HI> and fir&s;t fruits thence ari&s;ing. The fir&s;t and greate&s;t controver&s;ie between the <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Princes</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI> was about the be&s;tow|ing the Livings of the Church, and giving the in|ve&s;titure unto <HI>Bi&s;hops.</HI> The <HI>Popes</HI> had long thir|&s;ted after that authority, as being a great meanes to advance their followers, and e&s;tabli&s;h their own greatne&s;s; for which cau&s;e, in divers petty <HI>Coun|cels,</HI> the receiving of any <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> preferment of a <HI>Lay-man</HI> was decreed to be <HI>Simony.</HI> But this did little edifie with &s;uch patrons as had good Li|vings: As &s;oon as ever <HI>Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">el brand,</HI> in the Cata|logue of the <HI>Popes</HI> called <HI>Gregory</HI> the &s;eventh, came to the throne of <HI>Rome,</HI> he &s;et him&s;elf entirely to

effect the bu&s;ine&s;s as well in <HI>Germany</HI> now he was <HI>Pope,</HI> as he had done in <HI>France</HI> whil&s;t he was <HI>Le|gate.</HI> He commandeth therefore <HI>Henry</HI> the third <HI>Emperour: Ne deinceps Epi&s;copatus &amp; Beneficia</HI> (they are <HI>Platina</HI>'s own words) <HI>per cupiditatem Simoniacam committat, aliter &s;e u&s;urum in ip&s;um cen&s;uris Eccle&s;ia&s;ticis.</HI> To this inju&s;tice when the <HI>Emperour</HI> would not yeild, he called a &s;olemn <HI>Council</HI> at the <HI>Lateran,</HI> where the <HI>Emperour</HI> was pronounced to be <HI>Simoniacal,</HI> and afterwards ex|communicated: Neither would this <HI>Tyrant</HI> ever leave per&s;ecuting of him till he had laid him in his grave. After this followed great &s;trugling between the <HI>Popes</HI> and the <HI>Emperours</HI> for this very matter; but in the end the <HI>Popes</HI> got the victory. In <HI>Eng|land</HI> here, he that fir&s;t bickered about it was <HI>Willi|am Rufus,</HI> the controver&s;ie being, whether he or <HI>Pope &V;rban</HI> &s;hould inve&s;t <HI>An&s;elme Archbi&s;hop</HI> of <HI>Canterbury. An&s;elme</HI> would receive his inve&s;titure of none but the <HI>Pope</HI>; whereupon the <HI>King</HI> ba|ni&s;hed him the Realm, into which he was not ad|mitted till the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd. He to endear him&s;elf with his <HI>Clergy</HI> relinqui&s;hed his right to the <HI>Pope</HI>; but afterwards repenting him&s;elf of it, he revoked his grant. Neither did the <HI>Engli&s;h Kings</HI> wholly loo&s;e it, till the raign of that unfor|tunate Prince <HI>King John, Edward</HI> the fir&s;t again recovered it, and his Succe&s;&s;ors kept it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Popes</HI> having with much violence and op|po&s;ition wre&s;ted into their hands this Priviledge, of nominating <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> and inve&s;ting <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> they &s;pared not to lay on what taxes they plea&s;ed; as on the <HI>Benefices, Fir&s;t fruits, Pen&s;ions, Sub&s;idies,

Fifteenths, Tenths</HI>; and on the <HI>Bi&s;hopricks,</HI> for <HI>Palls, Mitres, Cro&s;iers, Rings,</HI> and I know not what bables. By the&s;e means the Churches were &s;o impoveri&s;hed; that upon complaint made unto the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Ba&s;el,</HI> all the&s;e cheating tricks, the&s;e <HI>aucupia &amp; eapilandi rationes,</HI> were aboli&s;hed. This <HI>Decree</HI> was called <HI>Pragmatica &s;anctio,</HI> and was con|firmed in <HI>France</HI> by <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;eventh, <HI>Anno</HI> 1438. An act of &s;ingular improvement to the <HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> which yearly be|fore, as the Court of Parliament manife&s;ted to <HI>Lewis</HI> the eleventh had drained the State of a mil|lion of Crowns. Since which time the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>France</HI> have &s;ometimes omitted the vigour of the <HI>Sanction,</HI> and &s;ometimes al&s;o exacted it, according as their affairs with the <HI>Pope</HI> &s;tood: for which cau&s;e it was called, <HI>fraenum pontificum:</HI> At the la&s;t <HI>King Francis</HI> the fir&s;t having conquered <HI>Millain,</HI> fell unto this compo&s;ition with his <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> namely, that upon the falling of any <HI>Abbacie</HI> or <HI>Bi&s;hoprick</HI> the <HI>King</HI> &s;hould have &s;ix moneths time to pre&s;ent a fit man unto him, whom the <HI>Pope</HI> legally might inve&s;t: If the <HI>King</HI> neglected his time limited, the <HI>Pope</HI> might take the benefit of the relap&s;e, and in|&s;titute whom he plea&s;ed. So is it al&s;o with the in|ferior benifices between the <HI>Pope</HI> and the <HI>Patrons</HI>; in&s;omuch that any or every <HI>Lay-patron</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> together in <HI>England,</HI> hath for ought I &s;ee (at the lea&s;t in this particular) as great a &s;piritual &s;upremacy as the <HI>Pope</HI> in <HI>France,</HI></P>
<P>Nay to proceed further, and to &s;hew how meer|ly titular both his &s;upremacies are, as well the <HI>&s;pi|ritual</HI> as the <HI>temporal,</HI> you may plainly &s;ee in the

ca&s;e of the <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> w^c^h was thus. In the year 1609. the <HI>Je&s;uites</HI> had obtained of <HI>King Henry</HI> the fourth licen&s;e to read again in their Colledge of <HI>Paris:</HI> but when their Letters Patents came to be verified in the Court of Parliament, the <HI>Rector</HI> and <HI>&V;ni|ver&s;ity</HI> oppo&s;ed them. On the &s;eventeenth of <HI>De|cember, Anno</HI> 1611. both parties came to have an hearing; and the <HI>&V;niver&s;ity</HI> got the day, unle&s;s the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> would &s;ub&s;cribe unto the&s;e four points: <HI>Viz.</HI> Fir&s;t, that the <HI>Council</HI> was above the <HI>Pope.</HI> Secondly, that the <HI>Pope</HI> had not temporal power over <HI>Kings,</HI> and could not by Excommunication deprive them of their Realms and E&s;tates. Third|ly, that Clergy men having heard of any attempt or con&s;piracy again&s;t the King, or his Realm, or any matter of trea&s;on in Confe&s;&s;ion, they were bound to reveal it. And fourthly, that Clergy men were &s;ubject to the <HI>Secular Prince,</HI> or <HI>Politick Magi|&s;trate.</HI> It appeared by our former di&s;cour&s;e, what title, or no power, they had left the <HI>Pope</HI> over the e&s;tates and preferments of the <HI>French.</HI> By the&s;e propo&s;itions (to which the <HI>Ju&s;uits</HI> in the end &s;ub&s;cribed, I know not with what mental re&s;ervation) it is more than evident, that they have left him no command, neither over their con|&s;ciences nor their per&s;ons. So that all things con|&s;idered, we may ju&s;tly &s;ay of the Papal power in <HI>France,</HI> what the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> fal&s;ly &s;ay of <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> namely, that it is <HI>Nomen &s;ine rebus.</HI></P>
<P>In one thing onely his authority here is entire, which is his immediate protection of all the Or|ders of <HI>Friers,</HI> and al&s;o a <HI>&s;uperintendency</HI> or &s;upreme eye over the <HI>Monks,</HI> who acknowledge very &s;mall
<PB N="188" REF="97">
obedience, if any at all, to the <HI>French Bi&s;hops.</HI> For though at the beginning every part and member of the <HI>Dioce&s;s</HI> was directly under the care and com|mand of the <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI>; yet it &s;o happened at the buil|ding of <HI>Mone&s;taries</HI> in the <HI>We&s;tern Church,</HI> the <HI>Abbots</HI> being men of good parts and &s;incere life, grew much into the envy of their <HI>Dioce&s;an.</HI> For which cau&s;e, as al&s;o to be more at their own com|mand, they made &s;uit to the <HI>Pope,</HI> that they might be freed from that &s;ubjection: <HI>&V;tque intutelam Dive Petri admitterentur.</HI> A propo&s;ition very plau&s;ible to his <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> ambition, which by this meanes might the &s;ooner be rai&s;ed to his height, and there|fore without difficulty granted: This gap opened, fir&s;t the &s;everal Orders of <HI>Friers,</HI> and after them the <HI>Deans</HI> and <HI>Chapters</HI> purcha&s;ed to them&s;elves the like exemptions. In this the <HI>Popes</HI> power was wonderfully &s;trengthened, in having &s;uch able and &s;o many props to uphold his authority; it being a true <HI>Maxime</HI> in State, <HI>Quod qui privilegia obtenent, ad eadem con&s;ervanda, teneantur authoritatem conce|dentis tueri.</HI> This continued till the <HI>Council</HI> of <HI>Trent</HI> unque&s;tioned, where the <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> much com|plained of their want of authority, and imputed all the &s;chi&s;mes and vices in the Church to this, that their hands were tied. Hereupon the <HI>Popes Legates</HI> thought it fit to re&s;tore to their juri&s;dicti|on their <HI>Deans</HI> and <HI>Chapters:</HI> At that of the <HI>Monks</HI> and <HI>Mone&s;taries</HI> they were more &s;ticking: till at the la&s;t <HI>Seba&s;tian Pighinus</HI> one of the <HI>Popes</HI> Officers found out for them this &s;atisfaction, that they &s;hould have an eye and in&s;pection into the lives of the <HI>Monks,</HI> not by any authority of their

own, <HI>Sed tanquam a &s;ede Apo&s;tolica delegati.</HI> But as for the Orders of <HI>Friers,</HI> the <HI>Pope</HI> would not by any means give way unto it.

<P>This near dependance on his <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> maketh this generation a great deal more regardle&s;s of their behaviour than otherwi&s;e it would be, though &s;ince the growth of the reformation, &s;hame and fear hath much reformed them. They have &s;till how|&s;oever a &s;pice of their former wantonne&s;s, and on occa&s;ions will permit them&s;elves a little good fel|low&s;hip. And to &s;ay truth of them, I think them to be the be&s;t Companions in <HI>France</HI> for a journey, but not for acquaintance. They live very merrily, and keep a competent table, more I &s;uppo&s;e than can &s;tand with their vow, and yet far &s;hort of that affluency whereof many of our books accu&s;e them. It was my chance to be in an hou&s;e of the <HI>Franci&s;|cans</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> where one of the <HI>Friers,</HI> upon the en|treaty of our Friend, had us into the Hall, it being then the time of their Refectory, a favour not vul|gar. There &s;aw we the Brothers &s;itting all on a &s;ide, and every one a pretty di&s;tance from the o|ther; their &s;everal commons being a di&s;h of pot|tage, a chop of mutton, a di&s;h of Cherries, and a large gla&s;s of water. This provi&s;ion, together with a liberal allowance of ea&s;e, and a little of &s;tu|dy,
<PB N="190" REF="98">
keepeth them exceeding plump and in good liking, and maketh them, having little to take thought for, maketh them (as I &s;aid before) pa&s;|&s;ing good Company.

With the&s;e ver&s;es I take my leave of his <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> wi&s;hing none of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors would pre&s;age wor&s;e luck unto <HI>England</HI>: I go now to &s;ee his <HI>Nuntio,</HI> to who&s;e hou&s;e the &s;ame <HI>Engli&s;h Catholike</HI> brought me, but he was not at home, his name is <HI>Ferdinando d' E&s;pado</HI>; a man (as he informed me) able to di&s;charge the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him by his Ma&s;ter, and one that very well affecteth the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Nation He hath the faire&s;t <HI>Egli&s;e,</HI> and keepeth the large&s;t retinue of any ordinary <HI>Emba&s;&s;adour</HI> in the Realm, and maketh good his Ma&s;ters &s;uprema|cy by his own precedency.

never be able to pay for his <HI>Cro&s;ier.</HI> But this is one of his <HI>Holine&s;s</HI> u&s;ual policies, to &s;atisfie his fol|lowers with empty titles. So he made <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> whom he &s;ent to govern for him in <HI>England</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chalcedon</HI> in <HI>A&s;ia</HI>: and <HI>Smith</HI> al&s;o, who is come over about the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s with the <HI>Queen, Bi&s;hop of Archidala</HI> a City of <HI>Thrace.</HI> An old <HI>Engli&s;h Doctor</HI> u&s;ed it as an e&s;pecial argument, to prove the Univer&s;ality of power in the <HI>Pope,</HI> be|cau&s;e he could ordain <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> over all Cities in <HI>Chri&s;tendom.</HI> If he could as ea&s;ily al&s;o give them the revenue; this rea&s;on I confe&s;s would much &s;way me, till then I am &s;orry, that men &s;hould &s;till be boyes and play with bubbles: By the &s;ame au|thority he might do well, to make all his Courtiers <HI>Kings,</HI> and he were &s;ure to have a mo&s;t Royal and beggerly <HI>Court</HI> of it.</P>
<P>To proceed a little further in the <HI>Allegory</HI>: &s;o it is, that when <HI>Jacob</HI> &s;aw <HI>E&s;au</HI> to have incurred his Fathers and Mothers anger, for his heatheni&s;h marriage; he &s;et him&s;elf to bereave his elder bro|ther of his ble&s;&s;ing: prayers and the &s;weet &s;mell of his Veni&s;on, the &s;weet &s;melling of his &s;acrifices obtained of his <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Father</HI> a ble&s;&s;ing for him, for indeed the <HI>Lord</HI> hath given unto this his <HI>French Jacob,</HI> as it is in the <HI>Text: The dew of heaven and the fatne&s;s of the earth, and plenty of corn and Wine</HI> Gen. 27. 5, 28.

<PB N="198" REF="102">
was fain to relinqui&s;h all that he had and fly unto his <HI>&V;ncle.</HI> This la&s;t &s;tory expre&s;&s;eth very much of the e&s;tate of the <HI>French</HI> Church. The <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> ha|ted the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> to &s;ee them thrive and encrea&s;e &s;o much among&s;t them; this hatred moved them to a war, by which they hoped to root them out all together; and this war compelled the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> to abandon their good Towns, and &s;trong Holds, and all their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and to fly unto their friends where&s;oever they could find them. And indeed the pre&s;ent e&s;tate of the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> is not much better than that of <HI>Jacob</HI> in <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> nor much different; the ble&s;&s;ing which they ex|pect, lyeth more in the &s;eed than in the harve&s;t, and well may they hope to be re&s;tored to the love and bo&s;ome of their brethren, of which as yet they have no a&s;&s;urance: For their &s;trength it con&s;i&s;teth principally in their <HI>prayers to God</HI>; and &s;econdly, in their obedience to their <HI>King</HI>: Within the&s;e two Fortre&s;&s;es, if they can keep them&s;elves, they need fear none ill, becau&s;e they &s;hall de&s;erve none. The onely outward &s;trengths they have left them, are the two Towns of <HI>Moutabon</HI> and <HI>Rochell</HI>; the one deemed invincible, the other threatned a &s;pee|dy de&s;truction. The <HI>Duke of E&s;pernon</HI> (at my being there) lay round about it, and it was &s;aid, that the Town was in very bad terms; all the neigh|bouring Townes, to who&s;e oppo&s;ition they mo&s;t tru&s;ted, having yeilded at the fir&s;t &s;ight of the Ca|non. <HI>Rochell</HI> its thought cannot be forced by a&s;|&s;aults, nor compelled by a famine; &s;ome <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> are glad of it, and hope to &s;ee the <HI>French</HI> Church re&s;tored to its former powerablene&s;s, by the re&s;i&s;t|ance
<PB N="199" REF="102">
of that Town meerly: I rather think, that the perver&s;e and &s;tubborn condition of it will at la&s;t drive the young <HI>King</HI> into a fury, and incite him to revenge their contradiction on their innocent Friends, now di&s;armed and di&s;abled. Then will they &s;ee at la&s;t the i&s;&s;ue of their own peremptory re&s;olutions, and begin to beleive, that the Heathen <HI>Hi&s;torian</HI> was of the two the better <HI>Chri&s;tian,</HI> when he gave us this note. <HI>Non turpe e&s;t ab eo vinci, quem vincere e&s;&s;et nefas, neque illi, in hone&s;te etiam &s;um|mitti, quem fortuna &s;uper omnes extuli&s;&s;et.</HI></P>
<P>This weakne&s;s and mi&s;ery which hath now be|fallen the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> was an effect, I confe&s;s, of the ill will which the other party bare them; but that they bare them ill will, was a fruit of their own grafting. In this circum&s;tance they were nothing like <HI>Jacob,</HI> who in the hatred, which his brother <HI>E&s;au</HI> had to him, was meerly pa&s;&s;ive. They being active al&s;o in the birth of it. And indeed the lamentable and bloudy war which fell upon them, they not onely endeavoured not to avoid, but in|vited. During the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, who would not &s;ee it, and the trouble&s;ome minority of <HI>Lewis</HI> the thirteenth. who could not mole&s;t them, they had made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of ninety nine Towns, well fortified and enabled for a &s;iege. A &s;trength too great for any one faction to keep to|ther under a <HI>King</HI> which de&s;ires to be him&s;elf and so rule his people. In the opinion of their potency they call A&s;&s;emblies, Parliaments, as it were, when and as often as they plea&s;ed. There they con&s;ulted of the common affairs of Religion, made new Laws of government, removed and exchanged their ge|neral
<PB N="200" REF="103">
Officers, the <HI>Kings</HI> leave all this while never &s;o much as formally asked. Had they onely been guilty of too much power, that crime alone had been &s;ufficient to have rai&s;ed a war again&s;t them, it not &s;tanding with the &s;afety and honour of a <HI>King,</HI> not to be the ab&s;olute commander of his own &s;ubjects. But in this their licentious calling of A&s;&s;emblies, they abu&s;ed their power into a neg|lect, and in not di&s;&s;olving them at his Maje&s;ties commandement, they increa&s;ed their neglect into a di&s;obedience. The A&s;&s;embly which principally the war and their ruine, was that of <HI>Rochell,</HI> called by the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> pre&s;ently upon the <HI>Kings</HI> journey into <HI>Bearne.</HI> This general meeting the <HI>King</HI> pro|hibited by his e&s;pecial Edicts: declaring all them to be guilty of trea&s;on, which notwith&s;tanding, they would not hearken to, but very undutifully went on in their purpo&s;es: It was &s;aid by a Gen|tleman of that party, and one that had been em|ployed in many of their affairs, that the very zeal of &s;ome who had the guiding of their con&s;ciences, had thru&s;ted them into tho&s;e de&s;perate cour&s;es, and I beleive him.</P>

I will in&s;tance onely in the tyrannical &s;laughter which he permitted at the taking of <HI>Nigrepeli&s;&s;e</HI> a Town of <HI>Queren,</HI> where indeed the Souldiers &s;hewed the very rigor of &s;e|verity, which either a barbarous Victor could in|flict, or a vanqui&s;hed people &s;uffer. <HI>Nec ullum &s;aevitiae genus omi&s;it ira &amp; Victoria:</HI> as <HI>Tacitus</HI> of the angred <HI>Romans</HI>: For they &s;pared neither man, nor woman, nor child, all equally &s;ubject to the cruelty of the Sword and the Conqueror: the &s;treets paved with dead carca&s;&s;es, the channels run|ning with the bloud of Chri&s;tians: no noi&s;e in the &s;treets, but of &s;uch as were welcoming death, or &s;uing for life. The Churches, which the <HI>Gothes</HI> &s;pared in the &s;ack of <HI>Rome,</HI> were at this place made the <HI>Theaters</HI> of <HI>lu&s;t and bloud</HI>; neither priviledge of Sanctuary, nor fear of <HI>God,</HI> in who&s;e Hou&s;e they were, qualifying their outrage.

Upon this the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> of the Town and Country about it, draw them&s;elves in Troops, &s;urprize many of the Towns about it, and at the la&s;t compelled the young Gentleman to fly from his inheritance; an action which jumping even with the time of the A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Rochell,</HI> made the <HI>King</HI> more doubtful of their &s;incerity.

And therefore the <HI>King</HI> upon a fore&s;ight of the dangers, wi&s;ely pro|hibited them to go to any A&s;&s;emblies without a particular licence, upon pain to be declared Tray|tors.

prejudice in his ab&s;ence.

But the&s;e tricks are ordinary here, other|wi&s;e a man might have con&s;trued this action by the term of rebellion. The chief meanes whereby the&s;e <HI>Princes</HI> become &s;o head-&s;trong, is an immu|nity given them by their <HI>Kings,</HI> and a liberty which they have taken to them&s;elves: By their <HI>Kings</HI> they have been ab&s;olutely exempted from all tributes, tolles, taxes, cu&s;toms, impo&s;itions and &s;ub&s;idies; by them they have been alwayes e&s;tated in whole entire Provinces, with a power of <HI>Hante and many ju&s;tice</HI> (as the <HI>Lawyers</HI> term it) pa&s;&s;ed over unto them: the <HI>Kings</HI> having &s;carce an ho|mage or acknowledgement of them. To this they have added much to their &s;trength and &s;ecuri|ty, by the in&s;concing and fortifying their hou&s;es, w^c^h both often moveth &amp; afterwards enableth the~ to contemn his Maje&s;ty.

A very impolitick cour&s;e (in my conceit) in the French, to be&s;tow honours and immunities upon tho&s;e, <HI>Qui</HI> (as the Hi&s;torian &s;aith) <HI>ea &s;uo arbitrio aut repo&s;cituri, aut retentu|rem videantur, quique modum habent in &s;ua volun|tate:</HI> For upon a knowledge of this &s;trength in them&s;elves, the <HI>Princes</HI> have been alwayes prone to civil Warrs, as having &s;ufficient means for &s;afe|ty and re&s;i&s;tance.

In&s;o|much that the greate&s;t &s;ort of <HI>Nobles</HI> in this <HI>King|dom</HI> can &s;eldom be arraigned or executed in per|&s;on, and therefore the Laws condemn them in their images, and hang them in their pictures.

If by chance or &s;ome hand&s;ome &s;leight any of them be apprehen|ded, they are put under a &s;ure guard, and not doomed to death without great fear of tumult and unquietne&s;s.

farre they are under their commandment, but how mi&s;erable and wretched they are in their apparel and their hou&s;es: For their apparel, it is well if they can allow them&s;elves Canvas, or an out&s;ide of that nature: As for Cloath, it is above their pur&s;e, equally, and their ambition: if they can a&s;|pire unto Fu&s;tian, they are as happy as their wi&s;hes: and he that is &s;o arrayed, will not &s;pare to aim at the be&s;t place in the Pari&s;h, even unto that of Church-Warden: When they go to Plow or to the Church they have &s;hooes and &s;tockings; at other times they make bold with Nature and wear their skins. Hats they will not want though their bellies pinch for it: and that you may be &s;ure they have them, they will alwayes keep them on their heads. The mo&s;t impudent cu&s;tom of a beggarly fortune that ever I met with, and which already hath had my ble&s;&s;ing. As for the Women, they know in what degree Nature hath created them, and therefore dare not be &s;o fine as their Hus|bands: &s;ome of them never had above one pair of &s;tockings in all their lives, which they wear every day, for indeed they are very durable: the goodne&s;s of their faces tels us that they have no need of a band, therefore they u&s;e none. And as concerning petticoats, &s;o it is, that all have &s;uch a garment, but mo&s;t of them &s;o &s;hort, that you would imagine them to be cut off at the placket: When the parents have &s;ufficiently worn the&s;e ve|&s;tures, and that commonly is till the rottenne&s;s of them will &s;ave the labour of undre&s;&s;ing; they are a new cut out and fittted to the Children.

But of their mi&s;eries, this me thinketh is the greate&s;t, that &s;owing &s;o many acres of excellent Wheat in a year, and gathering in &s;uch a plentiful vintage as they do, they &s;hould not yet be &s;o fortunate as to eat white bread, or drink Wine: for &s;uch infinite rents do they pay to their <HI>Lords,</HI> and &s;uch innumerable taxes to the <HI>King,</HI> that the profits ari&s;ing out of the&s;e commodities are onely &s;ufficient to pay their duties, and keep them from the extremities of cold and famine. The bread which they eat is of the cour&s;e&s;t flower, and &s;o black that it cannot admit the name of brown, and as for their drink, they have recour&s;e unto the next fountain: A people of any the mo&s;t infortunate, not permitted to enjoy the fruit of their labours: and &s;uch as above all others are &s;ubject to that <HI>Sarca&s;me</HI> in the <HI>Go&s;pel, This man planted a Vineyard, and doth not drink of the fruit thereof.</HI></P>

In this que&s;tionle&s;s they are entirely mi&s;erable; in that they are &s;en&s;ible of their pre&s;ent fortunes, and dare not labour nor expect an alteration.

If indu&s;try and a &s;paring hand hath rai&s;ed any of the&s;e afflicted people &s;o high, that he is but four or five &s;hillings richer than his neighbour, his <HI>Lord</HI> immediately enhanceth his rent, and enformeth the <HI>Kings</HI> task-ma&s;ters of his riches; by which meanes he is within two or three years brought into equal poverty with the re&s;t. A &s;trange cour&s;e and much different from that of <HI>England</HI>; where the <HI>Gentry</HI> take a delight in having their Tennants thrive under them, and account it no crime in any that hold of them to be wealthy. On the other &s;ide, tho&s;e of <HI>France</HI> can abide no body to gain or grow rich upon their Farms, and therefore thus upon occa&s;ions rack their poor Tennants. In which they are like the <HI>Tyrant Procru&s;tes,</HI> who laying hands upon all he met, ca&s;t them upon his bed: if they were &s;horter than it, he racked their joynts till he had made them even to it; if they were longer, he cut as much of their bodies from them as did hang over; &s;o keeping all that fell into his power in an equality of &s;tature. I need not make further application of the &s;tory but this, that the <HI>French Lords</HI> are like that <HI>Tyrant.</HI></P>
<P>How much this cour&s;e doth depre&s;s the military power of the Kingdom, is apparent by the true principles of warr, and the examples of other Countries. For it hath been held the general opinion of the be&s;t judgements in matters of war, that the main buttre&s;s and pillar of an Army is the foot, or (as the <HI>Martiali&s;ts</HI> term it) the infantry. Now to make a good infantry, it requireth that men be brought up not in a &s;lavi&s;h or needy fa|&s;hion of life, but in &s;ome free and liberal manner.
<PB N="235" REF="120">
Therefore it is well ob&s;erved by the <HI>Vi&s;count St. Albons</HI> in his hi&s;tory of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, that if a State run mo&s;t to <HI>Nobles</HI> and <HI>Gentry,</HI> and that the Husbandmen be but as their meer drudges, or el&s;e &s;imple Cottagers, that that State may have a good <HI>Cavilleria,</HI> but never good &s;table bands of Foot: like to Coppines wood, in which, if you let them grow too thick in the &s;tanderds, they will run to bu&s;hes or briers, and have little clean under wood. Neither is it thus in <HI>Franne</HI> onely, but in <HI>Italy</HI> al&s;o, and &s;ome other parts abroad; in&s;omuch that they are enforced to employ mercenary Souldiers for their battalions of Foot; whereby it cometh to pa&s;s in tho&s;e Countries, that they have much peo|ple but few men.</P>
<P>On this con&s;ideration <HI>King Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, one of the wi&s;e&s;t of our <HI>Princes,</HI> took a cour&s;e &s;o cunning and whole&s;ome for the encrea&s;e of the military power of this Realm, that though it be much le&s;s in territories, yet it &s;hould have infinite|ly more Souldiers of its native forces than its neighbour Nations. For in the fourth year of his raign there pa&s;&s;ed an Act of Parliament preten|sively again&s;t the depopulation of Villages and decay of tillage, but purpo&s;ely to make his Sub|jects for the warrs. The Act was, that all hou&s;es of Husbandry which had been u&s;ed with twenty acres of ground and upwards &s;hould be maintain|ed and kept up &s;o, together with a competent pro|portion of Land to be u&s;ed and occupied with them, &amp;c. By this meanes the hou&s;es being kept up, did of nece&s;&s;ity enfarce a dweller, and that dweller, becau&s;e of the proportion of Land, not to

be a beggar, but a man of &s;ome &s;ub&s;tance, able to keep hinds and &s;ervants, and to &s;et the Plow go|ing. An Order which did wonderfully concern the might and manhood of the Kingdom, the&s;e Farmers being &s;ufficient to maintain an able body out of penury, and by con&s;equence to prepare them for &s;ervice, and encourage them to high ho|nours: for,

But this Ordinance is not thought of &s;uch u&s;e in <HI>France</HI>; where all the hopes of their Armies con|&s;i&s;t in the Cavallery or the Hor&s;e; which perhaps is the cau&s;e why our Ance&s;tors have won &s;o many battels upon them: As for the <HI>French</HI> Foot, they are quite out of all reputation, and are accounted to be the ba&s;e&s;t and unworthie&s;t company in the world.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, &s;hould the <HI>French</HI> people be enfranchi|zed as it were from the tyranny of their <HI>Lords,</HI> and e&s;tated in free hold, and other tenures after the manner of <HI>England,</HI> it would much trouble the <HI>Councill</HI> of <HI>France</HI> to find out a new way of rai&s;ing the <HI>Kings</HI> Revenues, which are now meerly &s;ucked out of the bloud and &s;weat of the Subject. An|ciently the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>France</HI> had rich and plentiful demea&s;nes, &s;uch as was &s;ufficient to maintain their Maje&s;ty and greatne&s;s, without being burden&s;ome unto the Country. Pride in matters of &s;umptu|ou&s;ne&s;s and the tedious Civil warrs which have

la&s;ted in this Country almo&s;t ever &s;ince the death of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd, have been the occa&s;ion, that mo&s;t of the Crown Lands have been &s;old and morgaged: in&s;omuch that the people are now become the <HI>Demain,</HI> and the Subject onely is the revenue of the Crown; by the &s;weat of their brows is the Court fed and the Souldier paid, and by their labours are the <HI>Princes</HI> maintained in idle|ne&s;s. What impo&s;itions &s;oever it plea&s;eth the <HI>King</HI> to put upon them, it is almo&s;t a point of trea&s;on, not onely to deny, but to que&s;tion: <HI>Apud illos vere regnatur, nefa&s;que quantum regi liceat dubitare</HI>; as one of them: The <HI>Kings</HI> hand lieth hard upon them, and hath almo&s;t thru&s;t them into an Egypti|an bondage: the poor <HI>Pai&s;ant</HI> being con&s;trained to make up daily his full tale of brick, and yet have no &s;traw allowed him. Upon the &s;ight of the&s;e mi&s;eries and poverties of this people, Sir <HI>John Forte&s;cue Chancellor</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> in his book intituled, <HI>De laudibus Regum Angliae,</HI> concludeth them to be unfit men for <HI>Jurers</HI> or <HI>Judges,</HI> &s;hould the cu&s;tom of the Country admit of &s;uch a trial: for having proved there unto the <HI>Prince</HI> (he was Son unto <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth) that the manner of trial, according to the Common Law, by twelve <HI>Jurats,</HI> was more commendable than the practi&s;e of the Civil or Imperial Laws, by the depo&s;ition onely of two Witne&s;&s;es, or the forced confe&s;&s;ion of the per&s;on arraigned: the <HI>Prince</HI> &s;eemed to marvel, <HI>Cur ea lex Angliae quae tam frugi &amp; op|tabilis e&s;t, non &s;it toti mundo communis</HI>: to this he maketh an&s;wer, by &s;hewing the free condition of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects, who alone are u&s;ed at the&s;e

Inditements; men of a fair and large e&s;tate, &s;uch as dwell nigh the place of the deed committed: men that are of ingenuous education, &s;uch as &s;corn to be &s;uborned or corrupted, and afraid of infamy. Then he &s;heweth how in other places all things are contrary: the Husbandman an ab|&s;olute beggar, ea&s;ie to be bribed by rea&s;on of his poverty: The Gentlemen living far a&s;under, and &s;o taking no notice of the fact. The <HI>Pai&s;ant</HI> al&s;o neither fearing infamy nor lo&s;s of goods if he be found faulty, becau&s;e he hath them not.

<P>To go over all tho&s;e impo&s;itions, which this mi&s;erable people are afflicted withal, were almo&s;t as wretched as the payment of them. I will there|fore &s;peak onely of the principal: and here I meet in the fir&s;t place with the <HI>gabel</HI> or impo&s;ition on <HI>Salt.</HI> This <HI>gabelle de Sel,</HI> this Impo&s;t on Salt was fir&s;t begun by <HI>Philip</HI> the <HI>Long,</HI> who took for it a <HI>Double,</HI> which is half a <HI>Sol,</HI> upon the pound.

were very advantagious to the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> were it all in the <HI>Kings</HI> hands; but at this time a great part of it is morgaged. It is thought to be worth unto the <HI>King</HI> three millions of Crowns yearly, that onely of <HI>Paris</HI> and the <HI>Provo&s;ts</HI> &s;even Daughters being farmed at 1700000. Crowns the year. The late <HI>Kings</HI> &s;ince <HI>Anno</HI> 1581. being intangled in warrs, have been con&s;trained to let it to others; in&s;omuch that about <HI>Anno</HI> 1599. the <HI>King</HI> lo&s;t above 800000. Crowns yearly: and no longer then <HI>Anno</HI> 1621. the <HI>King</HI> taking up 600000. pounds of the <HI>Provo&s;t</HI> of the <HI>Merchants</HI> and the <HI>E&s;chevins,</HI> gave unto them a Rent charge of 40000. pound yearly, to be i&s;&s;uing out of the cu&s;toms of Salt till their money were repaid them. This <HI>gabel</HI> is indeed a <HI>Monopolie,</HI> and that one of the unju&s;te&s;t and unmea&s;urable&s;t in the world: for no man in the Kingdom (tho&s;e Countries hereafter mentioned excepted) can eat any Salt, but he mu&s;t buy it of the <HI>King,</HI> and at his price, which is mo&s;t uncon&s;cionable; that being &s;old at <HI>Paris</HI> and el&s;e|where for five <HI>liures,</HI> which in the exempted pla|ces is &s;old for one. Therefore that the <HI>Kings</HI> profits might not be dimini&s;hed, there is diligent watch and ward, that no forrain Salt be brought into the Land, upon pain of forfeiture and impri|&s;onment. A &s;earch that is made &s;o &s;trictly, that we had much ado at <HI>Diepe</HI> to be pardoned the &s;earching of our Trunks and Port-mantues; and that not but upon our &s;olemn prote&s;tations, that we had none of that Commodity. This Salt is of a brown colour, being onely &s;uch as we in <HI>Eng|land</HI> call <HI>Bay Salt,</HI> &amp; is impo&s;ed on the Subjects by
<PB N="240" REF="123">
the <HI>Kings</HI> Officers with great rigor. For though they have &s;ome of their la&s;t provi&s;ion in the hou&s;e, or perchance would be content (through pover|ty) to eat their meat without it; yet will the&s;e cruel villains enforce them to take &s;uch a quantity of them; how&s;oever they will have of them &s;o much money. But this tyranny is not general; the <HI>Normans</HI> and <HI>Picards</HI> enduring mo&s;t of it, and the other <HI>Pai&s;ants</HI> the re&s;t. Much like unto this was the licence which the <HI>Popes</HI> and <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> of old granted in matter of keeping <HI>Concubines</HI>: for when &s;uch as had the charge of gathering the <HI>Popes</HI> rents happened upon a Prie&s;t which had no <HI>Concubine,</HI> and for that cau&s;e made denial of the tribute, the Collectors would return them this an|&s;wer, that notwith&s;tanding this they &s;hould pay down the money, becau&s;e they might have had the keeping of a Wench if they would.</P>
<P>This <HI>gabel</HI> as it &s;itteth hard upon &s;ome, &s;o are there &s;ome al&s;o, who are never troubled with it: of this &s;ort are the <HI>Princes</HI> in the general relea&s;e, and many of the <HI>Noble&s;s</HI> in particular: in&s;omuch that it was proved unto <HI>King Lewis, Anno</HI> 1614. that for every Gentleman which took of his Maje&s;ties Salt, there were two thou&s;and of the Commons. There are al&s;o &s;ome entire Provinces which refu&s;e to eat of this Salt, as <HI>Britain, Ga&s;coine, Poictou, Queren, Naintogne,</HI> and the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Boulonnois.</HI> Of the&s;e the <HI>County</HI> of <HI>Boulonnois</HI> pretendeth a peculiar exemption, as belonging immediately to the patrimony of our <HI>Lady (No&s;tre-Dame)</HI> of which we &s;hall learn more when we are in <HI>Bovil|lon.</HI> The <HI>Britains</HI> came united to the Crown by a

For &s;uch is the lamentable fate of that Country, that their kindne&s;&s;es are made duties; and tho&s;e moneys which they once grant out of love, are alwayes af|ter exacted of them, and paid out of nece&s;&s;ity. The bedrolle of all the&s;e impo&s;itions and taxes is cal|led the <HI>Paneart,</HI> becau&s;e it was hanged up in a frame, like as the Officers Fees are in our <HI>Bi&s;hops Dioce&s;an</HI> Courts; the word <HI>Pan</HI> &s;ignifying a frame or pane of wain&s;cot. The&s;e impo&s;itions time and cu&s;tom hath now made tolerable, though at fir&s;t day they &s;eemed very burden&s;ome, and moved many Cities to murmuring, &s;ome to rebellion.

This indignity &s;o incen&s;ed <HI>Charles</HI> the &s;ixth their <HI>King,</HI> then young and in hot bloud, that he &s;eized into his hands all their priviledges, took from their <HI>Provo&s;t des Merchants</HI> and the <HI>E&s;che|vins,</HI> as al&s;o the key of their gates, and the chains of their &s;treets, and making through the whole Town &s;uch a face of mourning, that one might ju&s;tly have &s;aid:

This happened in the year 1383. and was for five years together continued; which time being ex|pired, and other Cities warned by that example, the impo&s;ition was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the priviledges re&s;tored. For the better regulating of the profits ari&s;ing from the&s;e impo&s;ts, the <HI>French King</HI> erect|ed a <HI>Court, Le Cour des Aides.</HI> It con&s;i&s;ted at the fir&s;t of the general of the <HI>Aides,</HI> and of any four of the <HI>Lords</HI> of the Councel, whom they would call to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

For the levying and gathering up of rhe&s;e taxes, you mu&s;t know, that the whole Country of <HI>France</HI> is divided into twenty three generalities and Counties as it were, and the&s;e again into divers <HI>E&s;lections,</HI> which are much like unto our Hundreds.

The Hedges in that Countrey are prodigall and lavi&s;h of tho&s;e trees, which would become the faire&s;t Orchards of the We&s;t, and in a manner recom|penceth the want of Wine by its plenty of <HI>Perry</HI> and <HI>Syder.</HI> In a word, what a good Writer hath &s;aid of one, we may &s;ay of both, <HI>Coelum &amp; &s;ol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m ita propitium habent, ut &s;alubritate &amp; ubertate vici|nis non concedunt.</HI> But the re&s;emblance betweene the townes is more happy; both &s;eated on the &s;e|cond <HI>River</HI> of note in their &s;everall <HI>Countreys</HI>; and which are not much unlike in their &s;everall cour&s;es. <HI>Severn</HI> wa&s;hing the walls of <HI>Glouco&s;ter,</HI> and pa&s;|&s;ing nigh unto <HI>Bri&s;toll,</HI> &s;eated on a little Rivulet, and its Homager divideth the ancient <HI>Britaines</HI> from the re&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> The <HI>Loyre</HI> gliding to the city <HI>Tours,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing nigh unto <HI>Angiers,</HI> &s;ea|ted al&s;o within the land on a little River, and one of its Tributaries, &s;eparateth the modern <HI>Bri|taines</HI> from the re&s;t of the <HI>French.

on both &s;ides: and a third which is indeed the principall, on the <HI>Ea&s;t-&s;ide</HI> of the <HI>City,</HI> it is called the <HI>Palle Malle,</HI> of an exerci&s;e of that name much u&s;ed in this Kingdome, a very Gentleman-like &s;port, not over violent, and &s;uch as affordeth good opportunity of di&s;cour&s;e, as they walk from one mark to the other.

Upon this warning the Church was founded, but at who&s;e charges they could not inform me: &s;o that all which I cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d learn concerning the foundation of this Church, is, that it was erected by Super&s;tition &amp; a Lie.

Nay they have con&s;ecrated unto it two <HI>Holy-dayes,</HI> one in <HI>May,</HI> and the other in <HI>Sep|tember,</HI> and are bound to &s;alute it as often as they &s;ee it in the &s;treets, or high wayes, with the&s;e words, <HI>Ave &s;alus totius Seculi, arbor &s;alutifera.</HI> Hor|rible bla&s;phemy, and never heard of but under <HI>An|tichri&s;t, Cruces &s;ubeundas e&s;&s;e non adorandas,</HI> being the le&s;&s;on of the <HI>Ancients.</HI> As for the Miracle I ac|count it as others of the &s;ame &s;tamp, equally fal&s;e and ridiculous.

<P>THe difference between an <HI>&V;niver&s;ity</HI> and an <HI>Academy</HI> &s;tanding thus; tho&s;e which lived in our Fathers dayes, could hardly have called <HI>Or|leans</HI> an <HI>&V;niver&s;ity</HI>: a <HI>Shoole</HI> of <HI>Law</HI> being the name mo&s;t fit for it.

&s;aid to intend the fa&s;tening of his e&s;tate upon it.

Upon this ground they trouble not their heads with the <HI>Crotchets</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;ick,</HI> nor &s;pend their mouthes up|on the chanting out of their Services: they have other matters to employ their braines upon, &s;uch as are the ruine of <HI>Kingdoms</HI> &amp; de&s;olation of <HI>Coun|treys.</HI> It was the &s;aying of <HI>Themi&s;tocles,</HI> being re|que&s;ted to play a Le&s;&s;on on the <HI>Lute, That he could not fiddle, but he could tell how to make a little Town a great City.</HI> The like may we &s;ay of the <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> they are no great &s;ingers, but are well skilled in making little <HI>cities</HI> great, and great ones little: and certaine it is, that they are &s;o farre from any ability or de&s;ire this way, that upon any of their &s;olemne Fe&s;tivals, when their Statutes require <HI>Mu|&s;ick,</HI> they are faine to hire the Singing men of the next <HI>Cathedrall,</HI> as here upon the fea&s;t of their <HI>Pa|tron</HI> St. <HI>Ignatius,</HI> being the 22. of <HI>July;</HI> they were compelled to make u&s;e of the voyces of the church of S. <HI>Croix.</HI></P>
<P>To this advantage of lei&s;ure is added the exact method of their teaching, which is indeed &s;o excel|lent, that the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> them&s;elves in &s;ome pla|ces &s;end their &s;ons to their <HI>Schooles,</HI> upon de&s;ire to

have them prove exqui&s;ite in tho&s;e arts they teach. To them re&s;ort the Children of the rich as well as of the poor, and that in &s;uch abundance, that where&s;oever they &s;ettle; other hou&s;es become in a manner de&s;olate, or frequented only by tho&s;e of the more heavy and phlegmatick con&s;titutions. Into their Schooles when they have received them, they place them in that forme or <HI>Cla&s;&s;e,</HI> into which they are be&s;t fitted to enter.

That yeare ended, he removeth both him&s;elfe and Schollars with him into the <HI>Cla&s;&s;es</HI> or Schoole next beyond him, till he hath brought them through the whole &s;tudy of humanity. In the la&s;t Forme, which is that of <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> he continueth two yeares, which once expired, his Scholars are made perfect in the Univer&s;ality of Learning, and them&s;elves are manumitted from their <HI>Tutors,</HI> and permitted their private Studies. Nor doe they onely teach their Scholars an exictne&s;&s;e in tho&s;e &s;everall parts of Learning which they handle: but they al&s;o endeavour to breed in them an ob&s;tinacy of minde, and a &s;turdy eagerne&s;&s;e of &s;pirit, to make them thereby hot pro&s;ecutors of their own opini|ons, and impatient of any contrary con&s;ideration:

<P>THat night we went from <HI>Clermont</HI> to a Town called <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etaul,</HI> where we were harboured, be|ing
<PB N="323" REF="162">
from <HI>Clermont</HI> &s;ix <HI>French</HI> Leagues, and from <HI>Paris</HI> twenty. Our entertainment there &s;uch as in other places, as &s;lutti&s;h and as inconvenient. The next day, being the twenty ninth, about ten of the clock we had a &s;ight of the goodly and fair <HI>City</HI> of <HI>Amiens.</HI> A <HI>City</HI> of &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles circuit within the wals, which is all the greatne&s;s of it, for without the wals it hath hou&s;es few or none. A <HI>City</HI> very capacious, and for that cau&s;e hath been many times honoured with the per&s;ons and trains of many great <HI>Princes</HI>: Be&s;ides that, once it en|tertained almo&s;t a whole Army of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> For <HI>King Lewis</HI> the eleventh having made an advan|tagious peace with our <HI>Edward,</HI> and perceiving how ingrateful it was among&s;t the military men, he intended al&s;o to give them &s;ome manner of &s;a|tisfaction: he &s;ent therefore unto them three hun|dred Carts laden with the be&s;t Wines, and &s;eeing how acceptable a pre&s;ent that had proved, he in|tended al&s;o to fea&s;t them in <HI>Amiens</HI>; within half a league of which their Camp was lodged. This entertainment la&s;ted four dayes, each &s;treet having in it two long tables, and each table being furni&s;h|ed with very plentiful provi&s;ion Neither were they denied entrance into any of the Taverns or Victualling-hou&s;es, or therein &s;tinted either in meats or drinks, what&s;oever was called for, was de|fraied by <HI>King Lewis.</HI> An action wherein, if my opinion might carry it, there was little of the <HI>Poli|tician</HI>; for there were permitted to enter into the Town &s;o many of the <HI>Engli&s;h-men</HI> at once, that had they been but &s;o minded, they might ea&s;ily have made them&s;elves as well Ma&s;ters of the place, as of

<P>The buildings of this Town are of divers mate|rials, &s;ome built of &s;tone, others of wood, and &s;ome again of both: the &s;treets very &s;weet and clean, and the air not giving place to any for a lively purene&s;s: Of their buildings the principal are their <HI>Churches,</HI> whereof there are twelve onely in number. Churches, I mean, parochial, be&s;ides tho&s;e belonging unto <HI>Religious Hou&s;es.</HI> Next unto them, the work of mo&s;t e&s;pecial note, is a great large <HI>Ho&s;pital,</HI> in method and di&s;po&s;ing of the beds much like unto the <HI>Ho&s;tel Dieu</HI> in <HI>Paris,</HI> but in
<PB N="325" REF="163">
number much inferior: <HI>Et me tamen capuerant</HI>: and yet the decency of them did much delight me. The &s;weetne&s;s and neatne&s;s of the Town proceed|eth partly (as I &s;ay) from the air, and partly from the conveniencie of the <HI>River</HI> of <HI>Some,</HI> on which it is &s;eated: for the River running in one entire bank at the further end of the Town, is there divided into &s;ix <HI>Channels,</HI> which almo&s;t at an equal di&s;tance run through the &s;everal parts of it. The&s;e Channels thus divided receive into them all the ordure and filth wherewith the Town were other|wi&s;e likely to be pe&s;tered, and affordeth the people a plentiful mea&s;ure of water, wherewith to purge the lanes and by-corners of it, as often as them li|&s;teth. But this is not all the benefit of the&s;e Chan|nels; they be&s;tow upon the <HI>City</HI> matter al&s;o of commodity, which is the infinite number of <HI>Grie&s;t-Mils</HI> that are built upon them. At the other end of the Town the Channels are again united into one &s;tream, both tho&s;e places, as well at the divi&s;i|on as the union, of the Channels being exceeding|ly fortified with chains and piles, and al&s;o with bul|warks and out-works.</P>
<P>Neither is the Town well fortified and &s;treng|thened at tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages onely in the upper parts of it, having enough of &s;trength to enable them to a long re&s;i&s;tance. The <HI>Ditch</HI> round about it, &s;ave where it meeteth with the <HI>Cittadel,</HI> is exceeding deep and &s;teepy, the wals of a good height, broad and compo&s;ed of earth and &s;tone equally: the one making up the out&s;ide of them, and the other the in&s;ide. The Gates are very large and &s;trong, as well in the &s;inewie compo&s;ition of them&s;elves, as

in addition of the Draw-bridge. <HI>Subburbs</HI> this <HI>City</HI> hath none, becau&s;e a Town of Warr, nor any liberal circuit of territoty, becau&s;e a Frontier: yet the people are indifferent wealthy, and have a|mong&s;t them good trading, be&s;ides the benefit of the Garri&s;on and the Cathedral. The Garri&s;on con&s;i&s;teth of two hundred and fity men (five hun|dred in all they &s;hould be) who are continually in pay to guard the Cittadel: their pay eight Sols daily. The Governour of them is the <HI>Duke</HI> of <HI>Chawne,</HI> who is al&s;o the Lieutenant or <HI>Deputy Go|vernour</HI> of the whole <HI>Province</HI> under the <HI>Con&s;ta|ble.</HI> Their <HI>Captain Mr Le Noyr,</HI> &s;aid to be a man of good experience, and worthy his place. This <HI>Cittadel</HI> was built by <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth as &s;oon as he had recovered the Town from the <HI>Spaniards, Anno</HI> 1591. It is &s;eated on the lower part of the <HI>City,</HI> though &s;omewhat on the advantage of an hill; and &s;eemeth in my opinion better &s;cituate to command the Town, than to defend it, or rather to recover the Town, being taken, than to &s;ave it from taking. They who have &s;een it, and know the arts of Fortification, report it to be impreg|nable.

Nor am I able to contradict it: for be&s;ides that it is a skill beyond my profe&s;&s;ion, we were not per|mitted to come within it, to take a &s;urvey of it at a di&s;tance: As &s;oon as we approached nigh unto it, one of the Garri&s;on offered us the musket, a

<P>WE are now come to the <HI>Country</HI> of <HI>Bou|lonnois,</HI> which though a part of <HI>Picardy,</HI> di&s;daineth yet to be &s;o counted; but will be rec|koned a <HI>County</HI> of it &s;elf: It comprehendeth in it the Towns of <HI>Boulogne, E&s;capes</HI> and <HI>Neu&s;-Cha&s;tel,</HI> be&s;ide-divers Villages, and con&s;i&s;teth much of hils and valleys, much after the nature of <HI>England</HI>; the &s;oyl being indifferent fruitful of corn, and yeild|ing more gla&s;s than any other part of <HI>France</HI> (which we &s;aw) for the quantity.

<P>As for the Town of <HI>Boulogne</HI> it is divided into two parts, <HI>la haute Ville,</HI> and <HI>la Ba&s;s Ville,</HI> or the <HI>High Town,</HI> and the <HI>Low Town,</HI> di&s;tant one from the other about an hundred paces and upwards.

<P>In the fir&s;t front there was carried the <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> and after that the holy and &s;anctified Banner; next unto it followed all the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> of the Town bare|headed, and in their Surplices, &s;inging as they went the &s;ervices de&s;tinate to that occa&s;ion: after them followed the Men, and after them the Women of the Town by two and two, it being &s;o ordered by the <HI>Roman Ritual. &V;t Laicia Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ricis, faeminae a viris &s;eparatae pro&s;equantur.</HI> On the other &s;ide of the &s;treet went the Brethren <HI>dela Charite,</HI> every one of them holding in his hand a little triangular Banner, or a Pennon: after them the Boys and Wenches: in this method did the &s;olemnity mea|&s;ure every lane and angle of the Town, the <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> &s;inging, and all the people an&s;wering them in the &s;ame note. At the <HI>Church</HI> they began it in prayer, and having vi&s;ited all the Town, they returned
<PB N="353" REF="177">
again thither to end it with the &s;ame devotion. An action vety grave and &s;olemn, and &s;uch as I could very well allow of, were it not onely for one prayer, which is alwayes &s;aid at the time of this performance, and addition of the Banners: The prayer is this; <HI>Exaudi nos Deus &s;alutaris no&s;ter, &amp; intercedente beat&acirc; &amp; glorio&s;a Dei genetrice Mari&acirc; &s;emper Virgine, &amp; Seba&s;tiano beato Martyre tuo</HI> (this <HI>Seba&s;tian</HI> is their <HI>Ae&s;culapius,</HI> or <HI>Tutelary Saint</HI> again&s;t the &s;ickne&s;s) <HI>&amp; omnibus Sanctis po|pulum tuum ab iracundiae tuae terroribus libera, &amp; mi&s;ericordiae tuae fac largitate &s;ecurum.
