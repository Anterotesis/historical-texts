<P>_THe Dedication (as vvell

by Cu&s;tom (the great

not injurious to me, that this

&s;ublime Labours, &s;o I am a&s;&s;ured they

vvhich the Book-&s;eller having prevailed

vvith me to ca&s;t avvay &s;ome &s;pare hours,
as a Complement to my Countrey (at
lea&s;t to his Intere&s;ts) I vvas more ea&s;ily

be adverti&s;ement to you; &s;o that hovv
cheap &s;oever it appear in it &s;elf, my dear
Brother hath goodne&s;s enough to con|&s;ider
it, as expo&s;ing me to the cen&s;ure of
thou&s;ands upon the &s;ingle account of di|verting
him alone; and that having been
a principal de&s;ign of my life, I make this
addre&s;s, vvhere my affection, not my

<P>For the Matter, it is the Author mu&s;t

you, he is of a pa&s;&s;able reputation

<HEAD>A True De&s;cription of the
Mighty Kingdomes of
IAPAN &amp; SIAM.</HEAD>
<P>_MY fourteene yeares re&s;idence
in the low Countreys, (I may
rather &s;ay my bani&s;hement
thither,) being upon the
rendition of one of the Kings
Garri&s;ons, in the yeare, 1646
obliged by my Articles to
depart the Kingdome within &s;ix moneths (As
it hath, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, furni&s;hed me with
the knowledg of the Dutch tongue, &s;o hath it
given me roome to ob&s;erve the indefatigable
indu&s;try of that people, who all of them, in their
&s;everall &s;tations, and according to their &s;everall
povvers and capacities, doe unanimou&s;ly con&s;|pire
&amp; cooperate to their &s;upport and grovvth
in the World. And that I, by their example, or ra|ther
by the impul&s;e of my owne <HI>Genius,</HI> may
ca&s;t my mite, into the &s;ervice of my Countrey, I
judged it not wholy unprofitable to put this
<PB REF="7">
<PB N="2" REF="8">
&s;hort relation of the Great Kingdomes of <HI>Japan</HI>
&amp; <HI>Siam</HI> into the Engli&s;h tongue, which for the
va&s;tne&s;&s;e of tho&s;e Territories (&s;carce knowne to
us by name) The Reputation of the Authour
(vvho&s;e Collections are of great credit) But prin|cipally,
as a &s;pur to the Improvement of further
di&s;coveries &amp; Traffick by my ovvne Cou~trey men,
will not, I hope, be unacceptable to the Reader,
who I wi&s;h may &s;o far indulge the bad Engli&s;h
of one almo&s;t degenerated into a forreigner, (at
lea&s;t in his language) that it may receive a faire
acceptation, which is all I propo&s;e to my &s;elf in
this matter. I am not ignorant that among&s;t
the multitude of books, under which the Pre&s;&s;e
groanes, it is not enough, to write well. But
I being re&s;trayned to a Tran&s;lation, mu&s;t not pre|tend
to ri&s;e higher then my fountayne head. And
my Authour having made rather a collectio~ then
a Hi&s;tory, wherein he &s;eemes to affect truth
and brevity, more then the ornament of words
I thought it becoming me, if I would walke in
his ground, to tread in his &s;teps, wherein if you
will plea&s;e to divert your &s;elfe I &s;hall in his Per|&s;on
proceed to tell you.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<PB N="3" REF="8">
<HEAD>How great the Countrey of Iapan
is &amp; whether it be an I&s;land
or no.</HEAD>
<P>THe Countrey of <HI>Japan</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to bee
an I&s;land, though there bee no certainty of
it, this va&s;t territorie not beeing yet wholy di&s;|covered
to the inhabitants them&s;elves. I have
often enquired and been informed that Tra|vellers
have gone from the Province of <HI>Quanto,</HI>
the principal of his Maje&s;ties dominions where|in
the Imperial Citie and Pallace of <HI>Iedo</HI> are
&s;cituated, 27 daies North-Ea&s;t wards, before
they could reach the utmo&s;t point of the land
of <HI>Sungaer,</HI> bordering upon the Sea; being come
thither they pa&s;&s;ed over an I&s;tmus of thirty
three Engli&s;h miles broad, leading into the Cou~|try
of <HI>Iezzo</HI> abounding in &s;kins &amp; furrs of price.
This territorie is very great, mountainous but
litle inhabited. The <HI>Iappaners</HI> attempted its di&s;|covery
&s;everall times but in vaine, for though
they entred to &amp; fro, far into the Countrey, yet
they could never find its end, nor any certainty
co~cerning it, their provi&s;ions ordinarily failing
them, which inforced their fruitle&s;&s;e returnes.
The di&s;coverers reports of the&s;e, were &s;oe im|perfect
that his Maje&s;tie di&s;paired of any fur|ther
Satisfaction, the countrey being pre&s;ented
<PB N="4" REF="9">
as de&s;olate and unpa&s;&s;able, though in &s;ome place
inhabited with a people all over hairy (wear|ing
their Beards long, like the Chine&s;&s;es) bruti&s;h,
though otherwi&s;e well &s;haped. To con&s;ider
therefore the uncertianty whether this Coun|trey
be an I&s;land or no; wee may ob&s;erve that
the pa&s;&s;age betvveene <HI>Sungaer</HI> and <HI>Iezzo</HI> is no
running water, but an Inlet or long I&s;tmus of the
Sea it &s;elfe, 120 Engli&s;h Miles long, extending it
&s;elfe betvvixt <HI>Iezzo</HI> and <HI>Iapan,</HI> where it bounds
upon va&s;t mountaines and de&s;erts, about the
Province of <HI>Ochio;</HI> &s;o that, that way being
vvholly unpa&s;&s;able by land, travellers are for|ced
to ferry over the afore&s;aid <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> from
<HI>Sungaer</HI> to <HI>Iezzo,</HI> in Barkes and &s;uch &s;hipping
as they have: The tvvo great I&s;lands of <HI>Chir|kock</HI>
and <HI>Saykock</HI> are governed by Kings and
Lords that &s;hare vvith them in the Magi&s;tracie.
<HI>Chirkock</HI> hath one King and three Lords. <HI>Saykock</HI>
being the bigger of the tvvo, hath more Gover|nours,

<P>The Imperial Citie of <HI>Iedo,</HI> where his Maie&s;ty

three Moats and three Counter&s;charpes: The&s;e
Ditches are very deep, being bordered on both

with Eight or Nyne huge gates not right

with a Company of Souldiers, and tho&s;e being

Walls, which being likewi&s;e &s;urmounted, &s;e|veral
great Plains bordered with large Galleries
again&s;t the Sun and Rain, do pre&s;ent them&s;elves
to the common view. The Streets in the Ca|&s;tle
are extraordinary large, built on each &s;ide
with goodly Pallaces, belonging to the Lords
of the Kingdom: The Ca&s;tle Gates are very
&s;trong, and covered on both &s;ides with iron
Bars of an inch thick cro&s;&s;ing each other, and
fa&s;tened with Bolts of the &s;ame: every Gate
hath his Hou&s;e large enough to contain two or
three hundred Souldiers, and defen&s;ible upon

&s;tandeth his Maje&s;ties Pallace; it is

And the third is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the proud Pal|laces

principal Dukes, and Lords of <HI>Japan.</HI> The

to the Dignity and Riches of the Owners, all
<PB N="18" REF="16">

at a di&s;tance not unlike a Mountain of Gold;
for all the Lords (none excepted) rack them|&s;elves
to plea&s;e his Maje&s;ty by beautifying his
Ca&s;tle and their own Habitations; which their
lawful Wives and Children do likewi&s;e enjoy
after their decea&s;e, continuing always under
the Emperors eye as Ho&s;tages of their fidelity.
This City of <HI>Iedo</HI> is nine English Miles long,
and &s;ix broad, and is as clo&s;ely built as any City
in Europe.</P>
<P>The Court, how great &s;oever, is dayly
crowded with multitudes of Nobles, who with
their numerous Trains with Hor&s;es and <HI>Pa|lanquins</HI>
make the Streets too narrow for their
pa&s;&s;age. When the Emperor goeth abroad,
&s;ometimes on Hor&s;e-back, and &s;ometimes car|ried
in a <HI>Pallanquin,</HI> open on every &s;ide, he is
ordinarily accompanied with the&s;e Lords, who
are called his Maje&s;ties Companions; being
all of them of high State and Revenues, though
without Lands or other Office &s;ave their atten|dance:
They are Per&s;ons extraordinarily qua|lified;
&s;ome in Mu&s;ick and Singing, others in
Phy&s;ick, Writing, Painting, Elocution, and the
like. The&s;e are followed by the Life-Guard,
all Per&s;ons of quality and choice, being the
natural Sons of Kings and Princes, begot on
their Concubines and uncapable of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion;
<PB N="19" REF="16">
and the Brothers, Co&s;ins and Kindred of great
Lords, which, by rea&s;on of their many Women,
are very numerous: I will give you one example.
The Emperors Uncle, King of Mito, now fifty
four years old, hath as many Sons as he hath
years, and many more Daughters, who&s;e num|ber
is unknown. After the&s;e follows part of
the &s;econd Life-Guard, which con&s;i&s;ting of
&s;ome thou&s;ands, is &s;o divided, that half goes
a Cannon shot before his Maje&s;ty, and the
other half follows at the &s;ame di&s;tance.</P>
<P>However the number of the&s;e Souldiers be
great, yet there is not one of them which hath
not pa&s;&s;ed Examination, and found to be thus
qualified: They mu&s;t be active of body, ready
in the u&s;e of all &s;orts of Arms, and &s;omewhat
knowing in their Studies; e&s;pecially well exer|ci&s;ed
and trained, which they are to a wonder:
for when his Maie&s;ty moves, they go along,
Hor&s;e and Foot, clothed all in black Silk, and
ranked before, behinde, and on each &s;ide of
him: They march in &s;uch comely order, that
never a one is ob&s;erved to go out of his place;
and with &s;uch &s;ilence, that they neither &s;peak
nor make any the lea&s;t noi&s;e: Neither indeed
do the Citizens move their lips when the Em|peror
pa&s;&s;eth, nothing being then heard but
the ruffling of Men and Hor&s;es: The ways
and &s;treets, are at &s;uch times, made very clean,
<PB N="20" REF="17">
&s;trewed with &s;and and &s;prinkled with water:
No doors are shut, and yet no body dares look
out either at them or at the windows, or &s;o
much as &s;tand in their shops to &s;ee the Empe|ror
pa&s;s; all mu&s;t keep within doors, unle&s;s
&s;uch who will kneel upon mats before them.
When his Maie&s;ty goes on progre&s;s to <HI>Miako,</HI>
&s;ometimes the imperial City, which happens
once every five or &s;even Years, to give the
<HI>Deyro</HI> (which is the true Heir of the King|dom
and lives there) a vi&s;it, the preparations
are making an whole year before the orders
are given on what day and with what train
every great Man shall go, to the end that the
ways may not be pe&s;tered with their num|bers.
Half of the great Lords, according to
their turns &s;et out &s;ome days before, then
follows his Maie&s;ty with his Councellers, who
are followed &s;ome days after by the remain|ing
Kings and Lords. The concour&s;e of peo|ple
at &s;uch a time is incredible, the whole City,
though containing above One hundred thou|&s;and
Hou&s;es, not being big enough to lodge
them all; &s;o that tents and huts are rai&s;ed round
about the &s;ame for the Souldiers and common
People.</P>
<P>The di&s;tance betwixt <HI>Jedo</HI> and <HI>Miako</HI> is
reckoned to be one hundred twenty five Dutch
miles; At every two or three miles there is a
<PB N="21" REF="17">
City or open Town; and the whole is divi|ded
into twenty and eight Gi&s;ts or Lodgings,
whereof twenty are &s;trong Ca&s;tles: there is in
every quarter, from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t, a train
of Gentlemen, Souldiers, Hor&s;e, Provi&s;ions,
and all nece&s;&s;aries befitting &s;o great a Prince,
ordered there for his reception and entertain|ment.
Tho&s;e that &s;et out with him from <HI>Jedo</HI>
&s;tay in the fir&s;t lodging; tho&s;e that were there
remove with him to the &s;econd; tho&s;e of the
&s;econd to the third, and &s;o to the la&s;t; &s;o that
each train and their dependants follow his Ma|je&s;ty
but half a day, until all of them, accord|ing
to their in&s;tructions, marching in order,
do at length arrive at <HI>Miako,</HI> leaving the afore|&s;aid
Ca&s;tles and Lodgings to their u&s;ual Go|vernors
and Guards. In the return from <HI>Mia|ko</HI>
to <HI>Jedo</HI> the &s;ame method is ob&s;erved, all
things being prepared as formerly, without
trouble or confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>This year 1636 there is an extraordinary
great Edifice and Building at <HI>Niko,</HI> four days
journey from <HI>Jedo,</HI> which is to be the Burial
place of the Emperors Father, in who&s;e Temple
the great Copper Crown which the Ea&s;t-India-Company
gave his Maje&s;ty la&s;t year, is hung
up. There is likewi&s;e in this territory of <HI>Nia|ko</HI>
a very great Ca&s;tle, with double moats and
&s;tone walls, &s;trong and &s;umptuous: there are
<PB N="22" REF="18">
&s;everal Palaces in it; as al&s;o a great number of
Artificers, as Painters, Ma&s;ons, Statue-Cutters,
Gold, Silver, and Iron-Smiths, Cloathiers, and
all &s;orts of Handy-Crafts-Men, who have their
tasks &s;et them, but are well paid. This Ca&s;tle,
which &s;eemed to require three years for its
building, was finished in five moneths, though
it lies far in the Country, and out of all ways,
being only made to receive his Maje&s;ty in his
ceremonious vi&s;its of his Fathers Sepulchre.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ties Trea&s;ure con&s;i&s;ts in Silver and
Gold, packd in Che&s;ts, each weighing one thou|&s;and
<HI>Teyls,</HI> that is about four&s;core ordinary
pounds weight: the&s;e are placed in the &s;everal
Towers of his Ca&s;tle together, with other le|gacies,
with their writings, which are kept for
their Antiquity. This va&s;t Trea&s;ure increa&s;es
dayly, for the Revenue of two moneths, is suf|ficient
to defray the Emperors expences, how
great &s;oever, for one whole year.</P>
<P>This Emperors Father being the Son of <HI>Ongo|&s;chio,</HI>
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the Government
after the late troubles, died about the fiftieth
year of his age, in the year of our Saviour 1631:
being &s;en&s;ible of his end, he called his Son to
him, and among&s;t many other good coun&s;els,
concluded to this purpo&s;e; <HI>My Kingdom and all

<P>The&s;e &s;ix pieces be&s;towed on the three Bro|thers
are but of little worth, in compari&s;on of
the &s;ix other given the Emperor, and yet they
are valued at a thou&s;and gold <HI>Oebans,</HI> that is
<PB N="24" REF="19">
forty &s;even Teylens a piece. The Silver and
Gold which his Maje&s;ty gave to the Princes of
his blood, to &s;everal of his favorite Kings, their
Wives, his companion Lords, his Soldiers and
Gentlemen amounted upon account to above
Thirty Millions &s;terling.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Emperor being after his Fathers
decea&s;e in full and peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
Government, had as then no lawful Wife, be|ing
much given to Sodomy, which moved the
<HI>Deyro</HI> to &s;end him two beautiful Ladies, (of
his own kindred, and every way accomplished)
with a de&s;ire that he would be plea&s;ed to chu&s;e
one of them, that be&s;t plea&s;ed him, for his <HI>Mi|dia</HI>
or Empre&s;s. He did indeed con&s;ent to the
<HI>Deyros</HI> reque&s;t, but followed his old way of
living; &s;o that the young Lady, being de&s;titute
of the conver&s;ation she might rea&s;onably ex|pect,
was extreamly afflicted, although she
dur&s;t not let it appear for fear of her Husband's
di&s;plea&s;ure. At length her Fo&s;ter-Mother (a
Lady of great credit, both in re&s;pect of her age,
and in that she had bred up &s;o great a Prince&s;s)
finding the Emperor one day in a good humor,
adventured, though very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively, to &s;peak
to him in behalf of her Mi&s;tris; which she did
as followeth. <HI>Hovv is it po&s;&s;ible that your Ma|je&s;ties
affections should be carried avvay vvith
&s;uch unnatural plea&s;ures, and that &s;o beautiful a
<PB N="25" REF="19">
Creature as your ovvn Handmaid, vvho vvould
rejoice you in bearing another like to your Self,
should be forgotten, certainly she ought to be pre|ferred.</HI>
The Tyrant, though till now in his fro|licks,
grew angry, yet &s;aid nothing; but ri&s;ing
up retired immediatly: and &s;ending for all the
Over&s;eers of his Buildings, commanded them
forthwith to begin and build him a Ca&s;tle, with
high Walls, Moats, Bridges, and &s;trong Gates;
as al&s;o to adorn it within with all manner of
nece&s;&s;ary and &s;umptuous appertainments and
Lodgings. The work being finished with
more then ordinary ha&s;te, the beautiful Queen,
her Fo&s;ter-Mother, and all that train of young
Ladies which she brought with her from <HI>Mia|ko,</HI>
were put into it, where she is kept without
the &s;ight of men, and intirely for&s;aken of her
Husband. The Emperor's own Fo&s;ter-Mo|ther,
who was likewi&s;e in great e&s;teem and
re&s;pect as his own Mother, being much trou|bled
at this action of his Maje&s;ty, and &s;eeing he
had no Children, neither was like to have any
whil&s;t he lived thus, &s;ent into the &s;everal Coun|tries
in his Dominions to &s;earch out the mo&s;t
charming beauties that could be found; which
done, she di&s;po&s;es of them in &s;uch manner, that
his Maje&s;ty in&s;en&s;ibly had the &s;ight of them all;
among the re&s;t there was a &s;light maid, an Ar|morers
Daughter, who did &s;o far plea&s;e him,
<PB N="26" REF="20">
and gain upon his affections, that he lay with
her. The great Ladies of the Court, &s;eeing an
Artificers Girl preferred before them all, mad
with jealou&s;ie and rage, re&s;olved to &s;trangle
her Childe in its birth, which they cruelly
performed; but have hitherto kept the know|ledg
of &s;o black a deed from the Emperor, fear|ing
his ju&s;t indignation and revenge.</P>
<P>The Japan Chronicles write, that this great
Kingdom hath, until this hundred years, been
&s;till governed by an Hereditary Prince, which
they call <HI>Deyro,</HI> who was in &s;uch reverence
with the people, that never any tumults or civil
broils were rai&s;ed again&s;t his Per&s;on or Autho|rity:
He was e&s;teemed &s;o Sacred, that to op|po&s;e
him was judged no le&s;s criminal then to
fight again&s;t the Gods; both being inexpiable.
When any difference aro&s;e betwixt his &s;ubject-Kings,
&s;o that they armed each again&s;t other,
there was a <HI>Generali&s;&s;imo</HI> appointed to mediate
their quarrels, and punish, if need were, the
offending or tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing Prince: For the <HI>Dey|ros</HI>
them&s;elves were e&s;teemed &s;o holy, that they
never trod upon the ground; neither was the
Sun or Moon ever &s;uffered to shine upon them;
nothing of their Body was diminished or pair|ed
off, their hair, beard and nails being &s;uffered
to grow at length: When they did eat, their
meat was &s;till dre&s;&s;ed in new pots, and &s;erved
<PB N="27" REF="20">
up in new dishes. They have twelve married
Wives apiece, who are &s;everally honored and
brought with various ceremonies to this height
and &s;tate: When the <HI>Deyro</HI> goes abroad, he is
followed with the&s;e twelve Women, each in
her Coach, adorned with her Arms and Titles;
the&s;e have their Hou&s;es and Trains apart, all in
the <HI>Deyro</HI>'s Palace, built in rows, &s;ix on a &s;ide,
very magnificent, and beautified (as the Coach|es)
with their Names, Arms and Titles. The
Concubines dwell likewi&s;e by them&s;elves. Sup|per
is provided every evening in every one of
the&s;e twelve Hou&s;es, with voices and in&s;tru|ments,
though none knows who shall be ho|nored
with the <HI>Deyro</HI>'s company. Where the
<HI>Deyro</HI> enters, the banqueting and provi&s;ion of
the other eleven Hou&s;es is immediatly brought
thither; the other eleven Wives following
with their Ladies and Mu&s;ick, to divert and
make merry with her whom the <HI>Deyro</HI> thinks
at pre&s;ent worthy of his conver&s;ation: They
have their Comedies likewi&s;e, and &s;uch other
pa&s;times as befit &s;o &s;plendid an entertainment.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Deyro</HI> is ble&s;&s;ed with a Son, the
hoped Succe&s;&s;or of that Empire, a Nur&s;e is
cho&s;en for him out of eighty of the lovelie&s;t
Women of the Country, young and Noble
Wives to Per&s;ons of great quality and birth:
The&s;e Women are honored and received by the
<PB N="28" REF="21">
<HI>Deyro</HI>'s twelve Wives, and all his Women, as
al&s;o tho&s;e nine principal Lords who are of his
blood and kindred, and next the inheritance
in ca&s;e he have no i&s;&s;ue male, with extraordinary
ceremonies and fea&s;ting. The following day
forty are cho&s;en out of the four&s;core, the
which, the number decrea&s;ing, are entertained
more honorably then before; the day being
&s;pent in u&s;ual and pompous diver&s;ions, the re|cited
forty retain the Titles and Dignities of
Fo&s;ter-Mothers, but are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from further
attendance, though not without gifts and rich
pre&s;ents. Ten are again cho&s;en out of the re|maining
forty; out of the&s;e ten three; and la&s;t|ly,
out of the&s;e three one; in all which electi|ons
the honors, ceremonies and pre&s;ents are
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively heightned. Three days after the
la&s;t cho&s;en Nur&s;e is again highly entertained;
which being done, the milk is pre&s;&s;ed out of
her bre&s;ts into the Childes mouth, (which all
this while is held by one of the noble&s;t Ladies
of the Court;) which ceremony done, the
Nur&s;e is as then e&s;teemed worthy to take that
Childe into her cu&s;tody, being it hath ta&s;ted of
her milk and &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>The Ceremonies and Fea&s;ts of their Wed|dings,
Childe-bearings, and tho&s;e other which
they celebrate yearly, are performed with much
&s;tate and mode&s;t pomp, and are at this day in
<PB N="29" REF="21">
u&s;e by the <HI>Deyro,</HI> who wants nothing, &s;ave
that the Land is governed by another; the
rea&s;on and hi&s;tory whereof we will briefly de|clare.</P>
<P>The Office of Chief General was formerly
the fir&s;t in the whole Kingdom, which or|dinarily
was conferred upon the <HI>Deyro</HI>'s &s;e|cond
Son; but having then another Son,
which, for the Mothers &s;ake, he was willing
to advance, he divided this great charge be|twixt
them, with command, that they should
govern each his three years by turn. This took
for &s;ome time, until one of them, having
ta&s;ted the &s;weetne&s;s of ruling, was loath to
quit &s;o &s;plendid an employment; he there|fore
leagues with the great Lords of the Coun|try,
and &s;ettles his power &s;o fa&s;t, during his
Commi&s;&s;ion, that neither the commands and
entreaties of his Father, nor the violence of
his offended Brother, were able to remove
him: Yet this being a bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;o ill and
&s;o great con&s;equence, and like to embroil
the Kingdom in di&s;orders, the <HI>Deyro</HI> re&s;olved
to cha&s;ti&s;e his rebellious Son; which, by the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Kings, and the valour of his
former General, he did. And this was the be|ginning,
and the fir&s;t inte&s;tine war that ever
happened again&s;t the <HI>Deyro</HI>'s State and Au|thority.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="22">
The afore&s;aid General being for his good
&s;ervice continued in his command, ordered his
bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o well, that after his Maje&s;ties death
he made him&s;elf Lord of his inheritance, u&s;urp|ing
the Government of the Kingdom wholly
into his hands; leaving yet the <HI>Deyra</HI>'s Court
in its former &s;tate and greatne&s;s, (his Succe&s;&s;or
to his Revenue) and commanding he should
be u&s;ed in all things with the &s;ame re&s;pect and
ceremony as before. The&s;e proceedings pro|duced
another War, another General being
cho&s;en; who having overthrown the former,
u&s;urped to him&s;elf what he had condemned in
his Predece&s;&s;or, the Soveraignity of the whole
Land; which occa&s;ioned a third inte&s;tine War
more cruel and more de&s;troying then the other

Provinces began to &s;et up each for him&s;elf, &s;o
that the Countrey was well nigh ruined (Town
being again&s;t Town, and City again&s;t City)
by the&s;e di&s;&s;enting Grandees: During the&s;e
troubles it fell out that a bold active Fellow,
formerly a private Souldier, thinking it be&s;t
fishing in troubled waters, re&s;olved to put in
for a share; Having therefore got together
forty or fifty Companions, as de&s;perate as him|&s;elf,
he in a little time, what with his good for|tune
and good conduct, grew very numerous
and con&s;iderable, and having taken &s;everal

Ca&s;tles and Towns, drove likewi&s;e all that
&s;tood him out of the field; &s;o that in le&s;s then
three years he became ab&s;olute and Soveraign
Lord of the whole Kingdom. He, as the other
U&s;urpers, left the <HI>Deyro</HI> in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
all he formerly enjoyed (except the Govern|ment)
which he held him&s;elf; and was after|wards,
by the &s;aid <HI>Deyro,</HI> (unable to vindicate
his own right) acknowledged and crowned
Emperor of Japan with unimaginable pomp
and magnificence.</P>
<P>This Emperor, who&s;e name was <HI>Taycko,</HI>
being no le&s;s prudent then brave, fearing le&s;t the
great Lords of his Kingdom, reflecting upon
the lowne&s;s of his former condition might
contemn his pre&s;ent Authority, as di&s;daining
to be governed by one le&s;s then them&s;elves,
thought it be&s;t to keep them in action, the bet|ter
to divert them from caviling a new; he there|fore
&s;ent tho&s;e Kings and Chiefs, that he feared
mo&s;t, with an Army of &s;ixty thou&s;and Men,
to war again&s;t <HI>Corea,</HI> and reduce that Country
to the obedience of the <HI>Iapan</HI> Empire. The&s;e
he held there with kinde me&s;&s;ages, and reite|rated
promi&s;es of &s;uccours &s;even whole years,
commanding they should not return till they
had &s;ubdued and made conque&s;t of all: But
the Army longing for their Country, their
Wives and Children, and de&s;pairing of a re|turn,
<PB N="32" REF="23">
mutined; and de&s;troying, burning, and
plundering all they could meet, endeavoured
the &s;atisfaction of their pretended wrongs by
the de&s;olation of others. The <HI>Coreans,</HI> unable
to endure this violence any longer, &s;ent an
Amba&s;&s;ador to the Emperour <HI>Taycko,</HI> who,
being admitted into his Court, found means
to take away his life by poi&s;on, in revenge of
the manifold wrongs his Country had &s;uffered
by the injurious ambition of this Prince. The
Kings and Lords, commanding the Army in
<HI>Corea,</HI> hearing of their Emperor's death, re|&s;olved
to quit that Country, and to return eve|ry
one to his own, in expectation and hopes
who amon&s;t them might be cho&s;en to &s;ucceed
in the Soveraignty.</P>
<P>The Emperor being removed, left one only
Son behinde him, called <HI>Fideri,</HI> about &s;ix
years of age; but before he died he appointed
him a Governor, one of the greate&s;t Lords
of his Country, by name <HI>Ongo&s;chio;</HI> one whom
he had obliged by his favors, and relied upon
above all others for his fidelity: To this Per&s;on
he delivered his Infant-Son, with command,
that when he was fifteen years of age, he should
cau&s;e him to be crowned by the <HI>Deyro,</HI> with
the u&s;ual Pomps and Ceremonies, as Emperor
of <HI>Iapan. Ongo&s;chio</HI> being thus declared Go|vernor
of the Princes Per&s;on, was likewi&s;e by
<PB N="33" REF="23">
<HI>Taycko</HI>'s will, and the con&s;ent of his Subject-Kings,
made Regent of the Kingdom during
the minority, which for &s;ome time he peace|ably
ruled in his Ma&s;ter's name: But growing
now weary of &s;ubordination, he quickly for|got
his promi&s;e made to <HI>Taycko,</HI> and &s;ealed
with his blood; <HI>Fideri</HI> being therefore to be
removed, to make place for his greatne&s;s, he
a&s;&s;aulted him fir&s;t in his reputation, by laying
tho&s;e things to his charge he was no way guilty
of; among&s;t others, he accu&s;ed him of di&s;tru&s;t
of his Tutor, and that he made private prepa|rations
to extort the Government out of his
hands by force, before his time; he laid like|wi&s;e
ambition, and an untimely de&s;ire of ho|nor
to his charge, in that he &s;uffered him&s;elf to
be adored as Emperor before he was inve&s;ted
with the Power; and that the Kings and Lords
of the Realm, had done him that reverence
which was only due to a received Emperor.
But armed ambition needs not many excu&s;es,
<HI>Ongo&s;chio</HI> mu&s;ters his united forces in the King|dom
of <HI>Surnga,</HI> and marching thence to <HI>On|&s;acka,</HI>
where <HI>Fideri</HI> held his Court, be&s;ieged
him with all his might. <HI>Fideri,</HI> having held out
three moneths, being now reduced to great
extremity, would prevent his ruine by a &s;ordid
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; he therefore &s;ent to <HI>Ongo&s;chio</HI> to
beg his life, quitting all his pretence to the
<PB N="34" REF="24">
Empire, and de&s;iring only to &s;urvive a Va&s;&s;al
to the Conqueror. But <HI>Ongo&s;chio</HI> refu&s;ed all
manner of capitulation; and though <HI>Fideri</HI> &s;ent
out his Wife, who was his Adver&s;aries Daugh|ter,
to &s;upplicate his &s;afety, she could not be
heard of her Father. The Ca&s;tle being taken,
the Palace where <HI>Fideri</HI> had retired him&s;elf,
with his Mother and chief Friends, was en|compa&s;&s;ed
with great po&s;ts and palli&s;adoes,
and much wood being piled up about it, the
unfortunate Prince, and all them that were
with him, were mi&s;erably burnt and con&s;umed
with &s;ire. <HI>Ongo&s;chio</HI> having thus de&s;troyed his
Ma&s;ter, put all them to death who were con|&s;iderable,
and of his party; bringing the whole
Empire under his obedience by force, as <HI>Tayc|ko</HI>
had done before him. The year following
<HI>Ongo&s;chio</HI> died, not enjoying long what his
violence had &s;o quickly got him, his Son <HI>Coubo,</HI>

<P>THe Revenues of the commanding Lords,
as appears by their &s;pecifications, are very

va&s;t expences, enough to do with their mo|neys:
Fir&s;t, they are obliged, though never &s;o
far di&s;tant from Court, to re&s;ide &s;ix moneths
every year in the City of <HI>Jedo,</HI> to wait upon
the Emperor. Tho&s;e of the North and Ea&s;t
come one half year, which being expired, they
are relieved by them of the South and We&s;t;
who depart with his Maje&s;ties leave, after much
Ceremony, Fea&s;ting, and receiving of Pre&s;ents
<PB N="39" REF="28">
back to their &s;everal Countries. Thus they
take their turns at Court, which is infinite ex|pen&s;ive,
by rea&s;on of their numerous trains,
&s;ome of them travelling to and fro with one,
two, three, four, five, and &s;ix thou&s;and men.
The Lord of <HI>Firando,</HI> (where our Ea&s;t-India-Company
hath a Lodge) being but one of the
lea&s;t among them, travels with three hundred
Men, Gentlemen and others; and hath in his

Men and Women. Thus each Lord lives ac|cording
to his Means and Dignity, rather pro|fu&s;e
then &s;paring; &s;o that the City &s;warms with
Men and Attendance, which makes the Mar|kets
high and very dear. Their &s;umptuous
Buildings, their gorgeous Cloathing of their
Servants, e&s;pecially their Women and their
Attendants, their Fea&s;ts, their Pre&s;ents, and
other extraordinary Expences of that proud
and pompous Court, do &s;ufficiently keep un|der
the&s;e great Men; for their Charges &s;ur|mount
their Revenues, and they are found mo&s;t
commonly to be much behinde hand. Be&s;ides
all this his Maje&s;ties orders, the making of &s;e|veral
publick Buildings, as High-Ways, Chan|nels,
Ca&s;tles, and the like, all which are divided
among&s;t the afore&s;aid Lords then at Court,

without re&s;pect of expence, to the envy of

each other, with all &s;peed and indu&s;try imagi|nable.
The chief Lords when they build new
Palaces for them&s;elves, do be&s;ides the ordinary
Gates and Doors, cau&s;e another great and
&s;umptuous Port to be made, beautified with
Statues, and wrought all with hard Wax, or
Indian Lack, and richly guilt. This Entry being
fini&s;hed, it is covered all over with Plancks,
to keep the Sun and Rain from it; and conti|nueth
&s;o inclo&s;ed and &s;hut up, until &s;uch time
as the Emperour honours that Hou&s;e with his
pre&s;ence: After his Maje&s;ty hath pa&s;&s;ed and
re-pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;aid Gate, it is wholly
&s;hut up and never opened more; no man be|ing
afterwards found worthy to go in or out
at that Door, which hath been graced with the
Princes entry. His Maje&s;ty doth go but once
to fea&s;t in one Hou&s;e, all the preparations for
his entertainment being made ready long be|fore,
with great care and co&s;t; every thing be|ing
adorned with his Arms, and afterwards
never u&s;ed more, but pre&s;erved with great de|votion,
in remembrance that the Emperour
did vouch&s;afe to eat in that Hou&s;e. His Ma|je&s;ty
is always invited three years before hand,
in which time the preparations fit for &s;o royal
a Gue&s;t are making. After the Emperour hath
been there one day, the Princes of his blood,
his Councellors, and the Kings and great Lords
<PB N="41" REF="29">
are treated with incredible magnificence three
whole Moneths together. Briefly, the building
of &s;uch a Palace, and the treating of &s;o great a
Prince, is &s;ufficient to make a rich King poor;
and yet the&s;e ruinning profu&s;ions are not to be
avoided. When his Maje&s;ty goes a Hern-hunt|ing,
and hath taken &s;ome of tho&s;e Birds, being
of great e&s;teem in tho&s;e Countries, he &s;ome|times
be&s;tows one of them upon one Favorite
or other; which Pre&s;ent co&s;ts the Receiver
at lea&s;t a half years Revenue: for the Gift is &s;o
highly valued, having been taken by the Em|peror's
Hawks, and given with his own hands,
that the whole City &s;eems to partake of the joy,
it being abundantly te&s;tified by Fea&s;ting and
Pre&s;ents.</P>
<P>The Lord of <HI>Sat&s;uma</HI> had lately the honour
to entertain the Emperour in his new Palace,
but with better fortune then any of his greate&s;t
Princes; for his Maje&s;ty was &s;o well plea&s;ed
with his treatment, that he made him a Pre&s;ent
(of Beans, as he plea&s;ed to tearm it, for his
Hor&s;es) worth three&s;core thou&s;and Pounds a
year.</P>
<P>The Emperor di&s;po&s;es of the marriages of
his great Lords, who entertain their Wives
which are ordered them by him with extraor|dinary
carre&s;ings; they receive and lodge them
in their be&s;t Palaces, and allow them ten, twen|ty,
<PB N="42" REF="30">
&amp;c. to a hundred and more Gentle women
and Maid-Servants, according to their abilities,
to wait upon them, when they go abroad to
vi&s;it their Friends, which is allowed but once
a year. Their Women follow them in &s;hut
Pallacquins, forty or fifty in number, each of
them with two Chamber-Maids, on each &s;ide
of their Pallacquins one. The&s;e Pallacquins
are very richly made, wrought with Lack and
inlaid with Gold, carried &s;ome nine foot from
each other in good order, with great mode&s;ty.
The Wife that is given by the Emperor, is the
Mother of tho&s;e Children which &s;ucceed in
their Father's honors; but if &s;he prove Childe|le&s;s,
or have no Heir male, the Kingdom, or
Government, is ordinarily be&s;towed upon a
Stranger to that Race and Family. Every Lord
may have as many Concubines as he plea&s;es,
or can maintain, whereby Children indeed are
multiplied, though none inherit but tho&s;e that
are legitimate. The&s;e Lords enjoy all the plea|&s;ures
they can imagine, in the fruition of their
Women, Hou&s;es, Gardens, Ponds, Walks,
Mu&s;ick, Plays, and the like. They &s;uffer no
Men to come into their Wives Hou&s;es upon
any pretence what&s;oever, unle&s;s it be &s;ome few

lower condition, mu&s;t thus &s;pend their time,
without any manner of conver&s;ation with men;
the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pition is puni&s;ht with death; it be|ing
no le&s;s criminal to be thought ill, then to be
really &s;o. The&s;e Attendants are choice Maids,
bred up in an humble and hone&s;t manner, and
&s;o ob&s;ervant of their Ma&s;ter and Lady, that
they neither &s;peak nor &s;mile, but as they are

and others, other &s;uch colours as they be&s;t fan|cy,
mo&s;t embroydered with Gold. Every order
hath its Officers, con&s;i&s;ting ordinarily of &s;ix|teen
Per&s;ons, who are &s;eated according to their
quality, and &s;erved according to the cu&s;tom
of their Country. Tho&s;e young Per&s;ons are
all of Noble Extraction, fair, well bred, and
not entertained into this &s;ervice for le&s;s time
then twenty years; &s;ome, nay mo&s;t, for their
whole lives. Many are received into &s;ervice at
the age of four or five and twenty, &s;ome at the
age of twenty eight or thirty; and are be&s;tow|ed
in marriage by their Lords, upon &s;ome of
their Gentlemen, or Officers, according to
their merit; whom he then honours with an

thirty years in their &s;ervice, do ordinarily &s;pend
their whole lives there, being preferred to
Offices under their Ladies. All the married
Women, of what quality &s;oever, are trained
up by &s;uch rules, that they bu&s;ie not them&s;elves
with the affairs of this life, or trouble their
Husbands with unnece&s;&s;ary que&s;tions or de|&s;ires,
to avoid har&s;h returns, which are the
con&s;equences of any demands of that kinde,
when ever the Husbands vi&s;it their Wives,

they dive&s;t them&s;elves of all &s;orts of bu&s;ine&s;s,
not re&s;uming the con&s;ideration of it till they
quit the place, where the whole treatment is en|tirely
relating to what is amorous, as Banquets,
Mu&s;ick, Dancing, Plays, and the like, wherein

is to &s;erve the Man, to divert him, to bring
him Children, to give them education, and for
no other end; further, to avoid jealou&s;ie and
its con&s;equences, of vexation, blood and war,
which they have gathered from former expe|rience,
<PB N="45" REF="31">
when their Women had more liberty;
as al&s;o from tragical examples, recorded in their
Hi&s;tories, of divers who have been deceived
and ruined by them. Their Women are or|dinarily
true and mode&s;t, even to blu&s;hing,
whereof I &s;hall in&s;tance an example or two:
There was in the Kingdom of Fingo a Per&s;on
of quality, who had a Wife of extraordinary
beauty; the King cau&s;ed him to be &s;ecretly
murthered, and after &s;ome time &s;ent for his
Lady to Court: She obayed; but knowing
her Husband was made away by his practices,
an&s;wered his importunities in the&s;e words;
Mighty Prince, I ought in rea&s;on to rejoyce
and account my &s;elf extream happy, in being
thought worthy to &s;erve your Maje&s;ty; yet
permit me to affirm, that at the &s;ame in&s;tant
you approach me, I will kill my &s;elf; but if you
&s;hall plea&s;e to grant what I &s;hall de&s;ire of you,
I will give my &s;elf up to be your humble Hand|maid:
Allow me then the re&s;pite of thirty
days, wherein I may mourn for my Husband,
and cau&s;e him to be interred according to his
Dignity; after which, that I may, upon the
Tower of your Ca&s;tle, make a Fea&s;t for my
Husband's Friends, with them to put an end
to my mourning. The King condi&s;cended to
this reque&s;t; but wondred at the curio&s;ity of
it. The Ceremony being performed, at which
<PB N="46" REF="32">
the King was pre&s;ent, and in a good humour,
well heated with wine and his pa&s;&s;ions) the
Lady withdrew to the &s;ide of the Gallery, as
if &s;he would have repo&s;ed, and upon a &s;ud|den
threw her &s;elf over the walls, and broke
her neck, in the pre&s;ence of the King and tho&s;e
that were with him.</P>
<P>The other is of a certain Lord, who &s;ent

Her Mother being reduced to great
wants, wrote a Letter to her, wherein &s;he at

was bu&s;ie in reading of it, her Lord comes in,
and &s;he endeavouring to hide the Letter, he
perceived it, and in great choler would know
what the Letter was, from whom and from
whence it came? &s;he, a&s;hamed to di&s;cover

<P>THe Cities and Towns have no revenue

Gentry or Commonalty any Tolls, Exci&s;e,

give from forty &s;hillings to two yearly, ac|cording

<HEAD>What Crimes they punish
mo&s;t &s;everely.</HEAD>
<P>EVery individual, from the Emperour to
the meane&s;t Gentleman, hath the right of
Ju&s;tice over his Subjects and Servants. His
Maje&s;ty hath his ordinary Judges in all his Ci|ties
and Towns. When a Gentleman, or
Souldier, is condemned to die, he is allowed
the honour to kill him&s;elf, by cutting up his
belly with his own hands; whereas the Citi|zen,
Marchant, and meaner per&s;ons, &s;uffer by
the common Executioner. A Marchant, how
rich &s;oever, is not e&s;teemed at all, becau&s;e
they &s;ay, He liveth by his lying, making no
con&s;cience to cou&s;en and deceive the People
for his filthy lucre &s;ake: The Citizen and Ar|tificer
are likewi&s;e undervalued, becau&s;e they
are but Servants to the Commonalty, and for|ced
to live by their labours and manufactures:
Neither are the Country People of more ac|count,
becau&s;e of the mi&s;erablene&s;s of their
condition, being &s;ubject to perpetual &s;lavery
and toyling. But the Gentlemen and Soul|diers,
who are numerous, are honoured and
feared; and they do nothing, being maintained
and &s;erved by the Marchants, by the Citizens,
<PB N="54" REF="37">
and by the Country Labourers. Every crime,
how &s;mall &s;oever, is puni&s;hed with death;
e&s;pecially theft, although but to the value of
a penny; gaming, and playing for money, is
no le&s;s hainous then murther: and all other
Delinquents which de&s;erve the rigour of Ju|&s;tice
with us in Europe, undergo the &s;ame pe|nalty
here. Every one &s;uffers for his own
faults, except the matter be trea&s;onable, and
then the Father, Brothers and Sons mu&s;t like|wi&s;e
&s;uffer, and their goods be confi&s;cated;
and the Mothers, Si&s;ters, and Daughters be
given away and &s;old for &s;laves. The&s;e con|fi&s;cations
are not due to the Emperour, King,
or Lord in who&s;e Territories they happen,
but are re&s;erved under account for publick
u&s;es, as building of Churches, making of
Bridges, repairing of High-waies, and the
like.</P>
<P>It happened in my time, that a proud fellow
pre&s;ented his &s;ervice to a poor Gentleman,
demanding of him, by rea&s;on of his addre&s;s
and parts, more wages then he knew the Gen|tleman
could give; who vexed at the youths
impertinencies, and perceiving he jeered him,
replied with a compo&s;ed countenance, <HI>Friend,
you demand indeed much wages, but being I
think you will de&s;erve it, and that you are plea|&s;ing
in my eyes, I am content to receive you into

my &s;ervice.</HI> Three daies after his Ma&s;ter &s;ent
him on an errand; being returned, he was ac|cu&s;ed
for &s;taying out &s;o long, &s;o as no excu&s;es
would &s;ave his life; being forced to pay for
his in&s;olency under this colourable pretence.
The Lord of <HI>Finando</HI> did lately cau&s;e three
Gentlewomen of his Ladies attendants, to be
&s;hut up in Che&s;ts &s;piked with nails on every
&s;ide, becau&s;e one of them had had &s;ome con|ver&s;ation
with a certain Gentleman, (who was
likewi&s;e condemned to die, and his belly cut
up) and that the other two, knowing of their
companions practices, had not di&s;covered
them. Who ever findes his Wife in a lockt
or &s;hut chamber with another man, may law|fully
kill them both; the which, though very
rarely, hath indeed happened: If the Husband
be ab&s;ent, then his Father, Brother, Son, or
next of kin, nay a Servant may do it; &s;o that
Adultery is &s;eldom or never heard of among&s;t
them. A certain Gentleman, being jealous
of his Wife, pretended a journey from home;
but returning unexpectedly back, found ano|ther
Man with his Wife in the chamber; tran&s;|ported
with jealou&s;ie and revenge, he in&s;tant|ly
kills the ama&s;ed Gallant, and binding his
Wife to a ladder, let her &s;tand there thus
chained all night. Next morning he &s;ent to in|vite
all his and her kindred, Men and Women,
<PB N="56" REF="38">
to dinner; which however contrary to their
cu&s;toms, each &s;ex fea&s;ting and eating alwaies
apart, was through his importunity a&s;&s;ented
unto. The Women, who &s;at in a chamber
by them&s;elves, ignorant of what had happen|ed,
enquired often for the Lady of the hou&s;e;
to which her Husband made an&s;wer, that &s;he
was bu&s;ie in ordering their entertainment,
&s;he would wait upon them immediatly. The
Gue&s;ts being all &s;at, Men and Women toge|ther,
and dinner half done, the Husband
went and cut off the privities of his &s;lain Ri|val,
and putting them into a covered Box of
Lack, or Wax, deckt with flowers, unbound
his Wife, and clothing her in a winding &s;heet,
with her hair loo&s;e and hanging over her
&s;houlders, gave it her, &s;he not knowing what
was in it, adding, <HI>Go and carry it to our Friends
at dinner, and try whether for their &s;akes I may
not pardon you al&s;o.</HI> The poor Woman, half
dead and di&s;tracted with fear, did as her Hus|band
commanded her, and entering in this
dreadful po&s;ture, fell on her knees before the
company, and opened the Box, at &s;ight where|of
&s;he &s;unk down in a &s;wound, and being
clo&s;e followed by her Husband, had her head
immediatly &s;truck off by him; at which hor|rid
&s;ight the afrighted Gue&s;ts ran all out of
the hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="38">
Tho&s;e faults which are accounted crimi|nal
among&s;t them, are the breaking of the
Emperours commands and orders; Peculati|on,
or robbing his Maje&s;ties Revenues; fal&s;e
coyning, burning of hou&s;es, rapes, and the ill
governing of tho&s;e in Authority; he that is
guilty of any of the&s;e crimes, is puni&s;hed in
his per&s;on and po&s;terity; if it be a Woman
that hath offended, &s;he &s;uffers alone; nor &s;hall
&s;he die for anothers &s;in, only be given away
or &s;old. Their puni&s;hments are ro&s;ting,
burning, crucifying both waies, drawing with
four Bulls, and boyling in Oyl and Water. A
man who was to deliver Wood and Stone to
his Maje&s;ties Factours, had corrupted &s;ome
Souldiers and others appointed for the &s;er|vice;
this being di&s;covered, the Over&s;eers
were ordered to cut up their bellies; but the
Marchant was crucified with his heels upward.
This man, being a man of parts, was in good
e&s;teem with the Councellors and great ones
at Court, and however it be, that it is not
lawful to intercede for a criminal, yet the a|fore&s;aid
Grandees, out of pity and affection
to the Delinquent, having con&s;ulted together,
adventured to &s;upplicate his Maje&s;ty in his be|half;
whereupon they received this follow|ing
an&s;wer. <HI>I have under&s;tood your de&s;ires

your reque&s;t? or are your hearts likewi&s;e cor|rupted

and let ju&s;tice have her cour&s;e, and then
if any among&s;t you de&s;ire riches, let them go to
my Trea&s;ure and &s;atisfie them&s;elves; go, I give
you full liberty to do it.</HI> This reply did &s;o &s;tar|tle
the Petitioners, that they retired, not da|ring
to make any further in&s;tance, or &s;peak one
word more.</P>
<P>They have a peculiar method in puni&s;hing
of crimes, which I will al&s;o relate: It hap|pened
(as it did in my time) that a Gentleman,
appointed Governour of a Lord&s;hip near the
imperial City of <HI>Jedo,</HI> had forced his Tribu|taries
to pay more then they were obliged to
by their ordinary Tax and Contributions,
with which &s;urplus he had Lorded it for &s;ome
time; but this Exaction continuing, the In|habitants
&s;upplicated his Maje&s;ty for relief;
whereupon the Gentleman, together with
his whole race, were ordered to cut up their
bellies. The &s;aid Governour had a Brother
in the &s;ervice of the King of <HI>Fingo,</HI> two hun|dred
and forty Dutch miles We&s;tward from
<HI>Jedo;</HI> an Uncle at Sat&s;uma, twenty miles fur|ther;
a Son in the &s;ervice of King <HI>Kinocoumy;</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="39">
another Son in the &s;ervice of the King of <HI>Ma&s;|&s;amme,</HI>
an hundred and ten miles Ea&s;tward;
a third Son with the Governour of the Impe|rial
Ca&s;tle of <HI>Inquano;</HI> with two Brothers
more, that were Souldiers in his Maje&s;ties
Guards at <HI>Jedo;</HI> his younge&s;t Son was upon
extraordinary &s;ollicitations be&s;towed upon a
Marchants Daughter, who was an only Child
and very rich: All the&s;e Per&s;ons, however
Ea&s;t and We&s;t di&s;tant from each other, died
in one day, and on the &s;ame hour; for Po&s;ts
were &s;ent to all places where the&s;e unhappy
men did live, with orders to the Governours,
that they &s;hould cau&s;e them upon the eighth
day of the eighth Moneth, (the day limited
for their execution) when the Sun was in the
South, to cut up their bellies, according to
the u&s;ual manner; which was exactly perform|ed.
The afore&s;aid Marchant, well known to
our Society, dwelt at <HI>O&s;aua,</HI> but died for grief;
and his Daughter, unwilling to &s;urvive her
Husband, would (if &s;he had not been pre|vented)
have killed her &s;elf; yet &s;he could not
be hindred to de&s;troy that life, which was but
loath&s;ome to her after &s;o dear a lo&s;s; for &s;he
ab&s;tained wholly from eating, and expired
(concluding this fatal Tragedy with her own)
the eleventh day after. The People of this Na|tion,
e&s;pecially the Women, die with &s;trange

con&s;tancy and a&s;&s;urance, without any the lea&s;t

<P>Lyes are likewi&s;e puni&s;hed with death,
e&s;pecially if told to Magi&s;trates or Lords;
neither will any Ma&s;ter pardon that crime in
his Servant. The&s;e afore&s;aid manners of put|ting
to death, belong to the Gentry, the Soul|diers,
Marchants, Citizens and Pea&s;ants; but
the Kings and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing Lords are other|wi&s;e
puni&s;hed: There is a little I&s;land, three
miles in compa&s;s, and di&s;tant forty two miles
from <HI>Jedo,</HI> called <HI>Fait&s;nichina,</HI> &s;o &s;till and en|vironed
with rocks and precipices, that no
&s;hips of burthen can approach it: it was at
fir&s;t attempted in very calm weather by cer|tain
de&s;perate fellows, who climbing up tho&s;e
rocks, made a &s;hift to get on the tops of them;
and having pulled up with ropes materials and
nece&s;&s;ary in&s;truments for their purpo&s;e, fa&s;t|ned
beams and &s;trong po&s;ts in the rocks in &s;uch

&s;trong hanging nets, they can winde the boats
up &s;ome fathoms out of the water, and &s;o &s;e|cure
them again&s;t the to&s;&s;ing of the Sea; who&s;e
lea&s;t agitation throws them again&s;t the I&s;land,
and da&s;hes them in pieces, as it happened to
the lo&s;s of many a man before this expedient
was found. The I&s;land it &s;elf is very &s;tony

<PB N="61" REF="40">
it is hither that the offending Grandees are

communication or corre&s;pondency from
without with &s;trict guards of Souldiers, who
have their &s;tations upon all the &s;everal corners
of the I&s;land for that purpo&s;e: The&s;e Guards,
if winde and weather permit, are relieved e|very
moneth preci&s;ely, at which time they
receive provi&s;ion for them&s;elves, as al&s;o for

what ever the &s;ea or earth produces, accord|ing
to their &s;everal appetites. This Sect, called

Each of the&s;e twelve Sects hath its particular
Faith; &s;ome believe that the &s;oul is immortal,
that the fle&s;h is earth; and that the &s;pirit of
man &s;hall live in another world, happy or

<P>THo&s;e of this Countrey which were con|verted
to Chri&s;tianity by the Romi&s;h
Clergy, were them only which were per&s;e|cuted;
At fir&s;t they cut off their heads, and
afterwards crucified them, which &s;eemed then
very &s;evere; but when the&s;e cruel Idolaters
perceived that death was not formidable to
tho&s;e martyred Chri&s;tians, who went to their
executions with &s;inging and dancing, as if
they courted their torments, and that the
great numbers of them that &s;uffered did no

but rather &s;trengthen and increa&s;e their mul|titudes,
they re&s;olved to break them by more

they bound them to &s;takes, and ro&s;ted
them alive, de&s;troying thou&s;ands after this

their hands and feet bowing, &s;upporting and
dragging them naked in the pre&s;ence of thou|&s;ands

&s;o &s;tript and abu&s;ed, into great deep tubs full

peri&s;h after un&s;peakable mi&s;eries in that fear|ful
manner: they thru&s;t hurds into the Mo|thers
privities, and binding the Sons about
with the &s;ame combu&s;tible matter, thru&s;t and
forced them, as al&s;o the Fathers and Daugh|ters,
to &s;et fire each to other, whereby they
underwent unconceivable torments and pains:
&s;ome they clothed with &s;ods, and pouring
hot &s;calding water continually upon them, tor|tured
them in that manner till they died, which
dured two or three daies, according to the
&s;trength of the party; hundreds of them be|ing
&s;tript naked, and burnt in the foreheads
that they might be known, were driven into
the Woods and Forre&s;ts, all men being com|manded
by Proclamation, upon pain of death,
not to a&s;&s;ist them with either meat, drink,
clothing or lodging; many more put into pin|folds
upon the Sea-&s;hore, and kept there half
their time dry and half wet, being every tide
<PB N="68" REF="44">
overflown by the Sea; but the&s;e were permit|ted
to eat and drink, to keep them longer alive
in this mi&s;ery, which la&s;ted ordinarily ten or
twelve daies. The&s;e bloody Executioners put
out the Parents eyes, and placing their little
Children by them, pinched and plagued them
whole daies long, enforcing them with tears
of blood to call and cry to their helple&s;s Fa|thers
and Mothers for an end of their &s;uffer|ings,
which had no period but with their lives,
while&s;t their woful Parents, unable to a&s;&s;i&s;t
either their Children or them&s;elves, did often
die in their pre&s;ence, whom they could not
&s;ee for grief or &s;orrow. All the&s;e mi&s;eries,
too long and too many to relate, were borne
by the poor Chri&s;tians with con&s;tancy to a
miracle; except &s;ome few, who not able to
re&s;i&s;t the bitterne&s;s of the&s;e torments aban|doned
their Faith, for &s;ome relaxation from
pain. Once a year they preci&s;ely renewed
their Inqui&s;ition, and then every individual
per&s;on mu&s;t &s;ign in their Church-books, with
his blood, that he renounces Chri&s;tianity;
and yet all would not do, for many hundreds
of Chri&s;tians are found every year, and de|&s;troyed
with variety of torments. At la&s;t
they found a more helli&s;h and exqui&s;ite way
of torturing then before; they hung the&s;e &s;uf|ferers
by the heels, their heads in pits, which
<PB N="69" REF="44">
to give the blood &s;ome vent, they &s;la&s;ht light|ly
cro&s;s-waies, (but they do that now no
more) and in this po&s;ture they live &s;everal
daies, ten or twelve, and &s;peak &s;en&s;ibly to the
very la&s;t: The greatne&s;s of this torment &s;ur|pa&s;&s;eth
all other, being beyond all humaine
&s;trength to &s;uffer and be undergone, but by
&s;uch who are extraordinarilie &s;trengthened
from above. This extremitie hath indeed (by
rea&s;on of its continuance) forced many to re|nounce
their religion; and &s;ome of them who
had hung two or three daies, a&s;&s;ured me that
the pains they endured were wholly un&s;uffer|able,
no fire nor no torture equalling their
languor and violence.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tians being now almo&s;t rooted
out, there is an order, that when one is found
and condemned to be hanged by the heels,
he &s;hall be pardoned, in ca&s;e he informeth
again&s;t and produces another, which is now
too much practi&s;ed, for Apo&s;tacy helps no
more, and they cannot re&s;i&s;t the torments of
hanging, but are thus forced to betray one
another: neither will this help the&s;e mi&s;era|ble
creatures, for I have been a&s;&s;ured that they
regi&s;ter the names of &s;uch who were permit|ted
formerly to fall off, as al&s;o of &s;uch who
by their di&s;covering of others &s;aved their own
lives, with an intent, that when they &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="70" REF="45">
that they have the entire number and cata|logue
of all them who have and do yet profe&s;s
Chri&s;t, they may de&s;troy them all in one day.
During the&s;e bloody and &s;avage per&s;ecutions,
it happened that &s;ome Chri&s;tian Children, be|cau&s;e
of their beautie, were begged and &s;aved;
but many of them of eight, ten, and twelve
years old, &amp;c. refu&s;ed this grace, prote&s;ting
with courage, to a wonder, that they would
not live, they did not fear death; but would
go where their Parents went, into that joy
where they &s;hould be no more tormented:
Some of the&s;e Children who had not this
force, but de&s;ired to live and &s;urvive the&s;e
pains, were violentlie hurried to their deaths
by their Parents, with the&s;e comforting
words; <HI>Come my Children, do not live with
the&s;e wicked wretches, I will bring you into a
land that is rich and beautiful, where we &s;hall
continue for ever in joy and happine&s;s.</HI> The
common &s;ort of Chri&s;tians were but &s;implie
bound when they were led to their executi|ons;
but the Prie&s;ts, whether Portugals,
Spaniards or Japaners, had the hair of their
heads and beards half &s;haven off, the &s;haven
part being coloured red; bits were al&s;o put in
their mouthes, to hinder them from &s;peak|ing;
and their heads being pulled backwards,
with halters put about their necks and tied be|hinde

their faces directly upwards; and thus &s;itting
upon a lean hor&s;e, they were carried to the

foot high from the earth, made of planks
clo&s;ely covered with thick mats very artifici|ally
joyned, re&s;embling each other and uni|form;
they dwell mo&s;t below, their upper
rooms being employed to keep their &s;maller
hou&s;hold &s;tuffs; but their be&s;t Chambers,
where they receive and entertain their Friends,
are neat and &s;umptuous, according to their
&s;everal abilities. The Souldiers and Gentry
<PB N="72" REF="46">
have their hou&s;es divided, one &s;ide for their
Wives, and the other for them, for their
Friends and their ordinary vocation. The
Marchants and Citizens Wives dwell promi&s;|cuou&s;ly
with their Husbands, governing and
ordering their families as with us; but are
very mode&s;t, and never &s;poken to but with
re&s;pect, none pre&s;uming to u&s;e any freedom
in di&s;cour&s;e with them, although otherwi&s;e
innocent and harmle&s;s, for both the man that
took, and the woman that permitted this fa|miliarity
would be equally &s;lighted, and bla|med
and looked upon as culpable and &s;canda|lous.
Their hou&s;hold-&s;tuff con&s;i&s;ts ordina|rily
in fine painted gilt di&s;hes, in&s;tead of pi|ctures;
the walls of their chambers are al&s;o

round about being beautified with li&s;ts of
black Wax, very artificially wrought; mo&s;t

taken out, enlarges the rooms at plea&s;ure.
In the upper end of this partition they have a

one Wife, though as many Concubines as he
can keep; and if that Wife do not plea&s;e him,
he may put her away, provided he di&s;mi&s;s her

he be married, with impunitie; but
the Wife may not &s;o much as &s;peak in private
with another Man, as is already &s;aid, without
hazarding her life. What is &s;aid of divorce,
relates only to the Citizen, Marchant, and

not put away his Wife, although &s;he &s;hould
not plea&s;e him, and that out of re&s;pect to her

her according to her condition and ne|ce&s;&s;ities;
but may freely divert him&s;elf with
his Concubines and Women, and when the
humor takes him with his own Wife again.

years; the Engli&s;h but of late, who finding
but little profit and great expences, abandon|ed
this Traffick again. The <HI>Siammers</HI> and
<HI>Camboiders</HI> u&s;ed al&s;o to arrive with a &s;hip or
two, though not now &s;o often as formerly.
La&s;tly the Netherlander got footing there,
where they have &s;eated them&s;elves fa&s;t enough,
and traded the&s;e forty years. The principal
Commodities, as well tho&s;e which Strangers
bring, as &s;uch which are of the growth of the
Country, are all brought to the great City of
<HI>Meaco,</HI> which is the Staple of the whole
Empire; it is here that the Merchants and
Factors, from every part of the Land, do a&s;|&s;emble,
bringing with them &s;uch things as
<PB N="81" REF="50">
their &s;everal Provinces do produce, which
they &s;ell or change for others which they &s;tand
in need of. The&s;e Merchandi&s;es are carried
&s;ometimes two or three hundred miles to and
fro, over hills and dales, all upon hor&s;es,
whereof they have an incredible number. The
Traffick con&s;i&s;ts of all &s;orts of wares, as well
for the pride as u&s;e of man; Strangers bring
yearly four or five thou&s;and Picols of Silk,
each Picol weighing one hundred twenty five
pounds weight, be&s;ides a great quantity of
wrought Silks; two hundred thou&s;and Harts|skins;
one hundred thou&s;and Rochvellen|skins;
a great abundance of Hemp, Cloth,
Cotton, and red Wool; Carpets to &s;it upon,
Pewter, Quick-&s;ilver, and all &s;orts of Drugs;
Nutmegs, Peper, Musk, Sugar, Porcelan,
Camphier, Borax, Eliphants-Teets, red Co|ral,

<P>HEre are many very rich Merchants who

or have Factours at <HI>Meaco,</HI> where they ex|change
their Commodities for Silver, Gold,
<PB N="82" REF="51">
or other Wares, each according to his fancy
and convenience. The <HI>Japanners</HI> of old had
great corre&s;pondencie with them of <HI>China,</HI>
who&s;e Kings &s;ent Amba&s;&s;adors yearly to each
other, for entertaining their alliance, and the
negotiation of their Subjects; it happened
that the <HI>Japanners,</HI> who were numerous in
<HI>China,</HI> did mutiny, and in a tumult de&s;troy
a whole City, plundering, ravi&s;hing, and
&s;poyling all; but the <HI>Chine&s;&s;es,</HI> getting into a
body, fell upon the <HI>Japanners</HI> again, and put
all they could meet with to the &s;word. The
King of <HI>China</HI> hearing of the&s;e di&s;cords, was
no le&s;s amazed then in a wonder, that &s;o few
could do &s;o much mi&s;chief, and therefore re|&s;olved
to bani&s;h the <HI>Japanners</HI> for ever out of
his Kingdom; in memory whereof he cau&s;ed
a great &s;tone Pillar to be &s;et up, with the &s;tory
of their exile in letters of Gold. He likewi&s;e
&s;et out a Proclamation, that none of his Sub|jects,
upon paine of death, &s;hould &s;aile any

on the other &s;ide, came not through
any fault of the <HI>Chine&s;&s;es,</HI> but by the di&s;or|ders
of his own People. Since the <HI>Iapanners</HI>
have been bani&s;hed out of <HI>China,</HI> they u&s;ed
to &s;ail to <HI>Tayouan,</HI> where the <HI>Chine&s;&s;es</HI> brought

by the Court of <HI>China,</HI> they were
prohibited this Traffick likewi&s;e. Many years
after the <HI>Iapanners</HI> obtained leave to return
to <HI>Tayouan,</HI> as al&s;o to go to <HI>Touckien, Cam|bodia,</HI>
and <HI>Sian;</HI> which negotiation was again
di&s;turbed, upon this con&s;ideration, that the
Emperour of <HI>Iapan</HI> would neither offend nor
be offended by any Strangers, which had al|ready
happened by the extortions of the Go|vernours
of <HI>Sian</HI> and <HI>Tayouan;</HI> and therefore
none of his Subjects &s;hould any more traffick
or deal with Strangers out of their own Coun|try:
Another rea&s;on was, becau&s;e he would
have no Arms tran&s;ported out of his Empire,
(which could not be hindred by no way but
this) in&s;omuch that two <HI>Chine&s;&s;es,</HI> Father and

beheaded. But the chief cau&s;e of this inhabi|tion

Enemies, having &s;et a price upon their heads,
which by mi&s;take hath co&s;t many a Portugal
his life: further his ambition doth not extend
beyond the bounds of his own Empire, and
contenting him&s;elf with tho&s;e confines God
and Nature hath pre&s;cribed him; he wages no
war again&s;t his Neighbours, neither &s;uffers
his Subjects to mole&s;t or di&s;turb any out of
his obedience. No foraign Princes fall out by
<PB N="99" REF="59">
his in&s;tigation; neither doth he give or de|mand

power and might con&s;i&s;ts in the va&s;tne&s;s of his
Kingdom, and multitudes of his Souldiers;
he hath arms at will, Ca&s;tles that &s;eem impreg|nable,
Provi&s;ions in abundance, and Trea&s;ure
without end. The plenty of Gold, Silver,
Copper, Iron, Lead, and Pewter Mines is
great; and the abundance of Silk, Cotton,
Hemp, and thou&s;ands other commodities in|credible.
Brifley, this Countrie wants no|thing,
having no need of its neighbours at all;
whence his Maje&s;ty never &s;ought to foraign
Princes, and yet received all that came or &s;ent
to him with all imaginable civilitie and kinde|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Spaniards and Portugals, not ignorant
of the commodious &s;cituation, might and
riches of the Japani&s;h Empire, were no le&s;s
earne&s;t in the enlarging of their own &s;tate,
planting the Chri&s;tian Religion, and advan|cing
their traffick there, where other Princes
&s;eemed to de&s;ire. <HI>Don Iohn,</HI> the fir&s;t of that
name, and the tenth King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> was
very indu&s;trious in this <HI>Di&s;qui&s;ition;</HI> his Coun|trey
men having in four&s;core years, wherein
they continued their commerce in <HI>Iapan,</HI>
brought it &s;o far, that <HI>Manilha</HI> was rai&s;ed from
nothing by this negotiation, and <HI>Malacca Goa</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="60">
and &s;everal other places bettered and enriched
by it; witne&s;s their great Carga&s;oons, and
yearly returns more or le&s;s, as it happeneth,
amounting one with another to near a Million
and a half of Ducats; never gaining le&s;s then
fifty, and for the mo&s;t part &s;eventy five in the
hundred, as we found by experience in that
time that our Ea&s;t-India-Company &s;hared in
this rich commerce. The <HI>Mavaus</HI> and <HI>Por|tugals</HI>
fetched the&s;e va&s;t profits yearly, which
they gained in four or five moneths, whereof
they &s;pent &s;ome twenty daies in going and
coming upon the Sea, the <HI>Iapan</HI> principal be|ing
but one fifth part. Let every one con&s;ider,
whether this noble Negotiation and &s;weet re|turns,
are not capable to indear the&s;e Mer|chants
to this rich Country: Be&s;ides this, their
Religion, which by the zeal and indu&s;try of
their Prie&s;ts grew &s;trangely there, &s;o that they
had four hundred thou&s;and &s;ouls at once upon
a li&s;t, which made them in hope to become
ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters of the whole Kingdom; this
they purpo&s;ed, which had been ab&s;olutely ef|fected,
but that they wanted an head; and
were traver&s;ed in this great de&s;ign by the Ne|therland
Mini&s;ters. If they had brought <HI>Iapan</HI>
to their devotion and obedience, as God be
prai&s;ed they have not, it is no hard matter to
conceive the advantages they would have got|ten
<PB N="101" REF="60">
by it, and what they might further pre|&s;umed,
upon &s;o mighty an acqui&s;ition. But
my de&s;ign is not to in&s;i&s;t upon this matter,
only to undeceive tho&s;e men who blindly out
of prejudice or ignorance, not only &s;light the
Japani&s;h trade, but have given out, that it is
neither u&s;eful nor profitable for the Ea&s;t-India-Company.
But to return where we digre&s;&s;ed;
it is not imaginable that the <HI>Portugals</HI> and
<HI>Spaniards</HI> are &s;uch fools, as to &s;earch out pla|ces
to &s;eat them&s;elves in, and to carry on a
trade, where there is no advantage to be got;
that they have gained infinitely, and &s;hould
&s;till if they were not hindred by us, is vi&s;ible:
It is evident that they of <HI>Mavau</HI> are at pre&s;ent
rich, that their City is &s;trong, and their Hou&s;es
like &s;o many Palaces, wherein they live like
earthly gods in plea&s;ure and plenty, whereas
they were before but bare and needy. Neither
did the ill treatment they lately received in
<HI>Iapan,</HI> nor the per&s;ecutions of the Women
Catholicks there, nor the lo&s;s of <HI>Andrew Pla|&s;oes
Caraek,</HI> who was a&s;&s;aulted and &s;unk, by the
Emperours command and forces, before <HI>Nau|ga&s;ack,</HI>
nor the danger they incur by our &s;hips
at Sea, can deter or oblige them to quit this
Kingdom: when the danger to &s;aile thither
with great Ve&s;&s;els was too great, they trulked
with little ones; which this proud Nation,
<PB N="102" REF="61">
who a&s;pire to an univer&s;al Monarchie, would
never have done, if it had not been for the cer|taintie
and &s;weetne&s;s of the profit: What can
our People alledge to the contrarie? is it not
as we have formerlie &s;aid, that the door is not
open for us alone, but for all other Nations
who come as friends to negotiate in his Ma|je&s;ties
Dominions. During our abode in <HI>Ia|pan,</HI>
we have been treated with very great
civilitie; although we have not profited &s;o
much as the <HI>Portugals,</HI> yet we have gained
more honour then they; we have not lo&s;t at
all, and our winnings have been proportiona|ble
to our Carga&s;oons; we have had &s;everal
commodities thence, and much u&s;eful pro|vi&s;ions;
we have repaired many of our old
Ships in their Havens, and furni&s;hed them
with all manner of nece&s;&s;aries: The Fleets
we &s;end from hence every year to the <HI>Manil|has</HI>
again&s;t our common Enemie, return with|out
being que&s;tioned by any, and di&s;po&s;e of
their prizes at plea&s;ure, paying nothing but
the ordinarie rites, which is onlie a &s;mall pre|&s;ent
to the Emperour; what Chri&s;tian Prince
in Europe would treat us &s;o well, and mole&s;t
us &s;o little? Now that it hath plea&s;ed the Al|mightie,
that we by the good conduct of our
General <HI>I. P. C.</HI> do not onlie bridle them of
<HI>Maccau,</HI> but likewi&s;e hinder them to &s;aile to
<PB N="103" REF="61">
<HI>Iapan,</HI> and &s;o keeps them from that rich trade
they enjoyed &s;o many years; it remains onlie
that we &s;till keep them out, to which purpo&s;e
e&s;pecial care mu&s;t be had to u&s;e the <HI>Iapaners</HI>
well and civillie; to hinder their detriment,
and not to di&s;pi&s;e or mi&s;u&s;e them in any kinde,
but to &s;uffer every one to pa&s;s and re-pa&s;s
where their bu&s;ine&s;s calleth them, aiding and
a&s;&s;i&s;ting them with all po&s;&s;ible endeavour and
friend&s;hip. We mu&s;t not be le&s;s careful then
the <HI>Portugals</HI> have been, to furni&s;h this King|dom
yearlie with all manner of commodities,
bringing rather more then le&s;&s;er; for if it take
according to the Generals de&s;ign, which God
grant, they of <HI>Iapan</HI> will be deprived of the
<HI>Maccan</HI> commerce, as al&s;o of their trafficking
into divers others places, <HI>Kouthinchina, Kam|boia,
Siam</HI> and <HI>Manilha,</HI> from which places
they received betwixt two and three thou&s;and
picols of Silk every year, be&s;ides &s;everal other

it will be the onlie ob&s;tacle to hinder

<P>IN the year 1626. having had audience on the
twentieth of <HI>October,</HI> I took my leave of
both the old and young Emperour, four daies
before the fea&s;t; which &s;eemed &s;trange to
them that knew it, being their Maje&s;ties were
&s;o intent in their preparations for the <HI>Deyro</HI>'s
reception; but the&s;e men did not know how
de&s;irous the Emperour was to di&s;patch the
Hollanders before the fea&s;t: however the <HI>Si|ammer</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="65">
and <HI>Portugal</HI> Amba&s;&s;adours had not as
yet been publicklie received, and all by rea&s;on
of the pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s, which took up the
whole Court, in &s;o much that they were de|ferred
till that was pa&s;t; we being therefore
di&s;patched, had the more lea&s;ure and de&s;ire
to &s;ee this &s;olemn entertainment, and the ra|ther,
being invited to a &s;tay by the Lord of
<HI>Firando</HI> and <HI>Cacku&s;ymondonne.</HI> On the twenty
fourth we went towards the Emperours Pa|lace,
attended upon by all our Servants; and
having hired a place from which we might &s;ee
the whole proce&s;&s;ion, we were forced to &s;tay
there that whole night, by rea&s;on of the great
crouds of people that pa&s;&s;ed that way; on the
morrow following, being the twenty fifth,
as &s;oon as the day appeared, we &s;aw an innu|merable
company of people, who filled the
way up betwixt the Emperours Palace and
the <HI>Deyro</HI>'s Court. The &s;treets were made
very even, and &s;trewed with white &s;and, and
railed in on both &s;ides, and guarded all along
by Souldiers of both their Maje&s;ties and of
the <HI>Deyro</HI>'s, all clothed in long white ve&s;t|ments,
with head-pieces of black wax, and
armed each with two Sables and a Pike, for
defence of the pa&s;&s;age through which the
Coaches and Hor&s;es were to march; all run|ning
waters and ditches were covered with
<PB N="111" REF="65">
boards and planks; and &s;caffols were rai&s;ed
on both &s;ides the way for the &s;pectators.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t that pa&s;&s;ed were Servants that be|longed
to the <HI>Deyro</HI> and Emperour, with
many <HI>Palanquimos</HI> or Porters, who carried
the <HI>Deyro</HI>'s baggage, packt up in great &s;quare
Wax Che&s;ts (the covers whereof were paint|ed
with the <HI>Deyro</HI>'s Arms in Gold) to the Em|perours
Court: The&s;e were accompanied with
a great train of Attendants, who were again
followed by &s;ix and forty <HI>Palanquin</HI> Stooles or
Sedans, wherein the Women belonging to the
<HI>Deyro</HI>'s Wives were carried; the&s;e Sedans were
all of them curiou&s;ly wrought of bright white
wood, &s;ix foot high, laid with plates of Cop|per,
and finely painted, each of the&s;e being
carried by four lu&s;ty follows; after them went
one and twenty Sedans or <HI>Norimons,</HI> (for &s;o
they call them here) covered with black Wax
and gilded, and behinde them &s;ome twenty
&s;even more who&s;e doors and windows were
all gilded; &s;ome of the <HI>Deyro</HI>'s chiefe Lords
were carried in the&s;e, each of them having a
<HI>Quiro&s;ol</HI> wholly gilded, and covered with a
very rich covering, carried before them; the&s;e
Lords were attended by one hundred and eight
Pages in white liveries; behinde them marched
twenty four Gentlemen on hor&s;e back, clo|thed
and armed in their Habillements of war;

their Head-pieces were of Wax, with little
black feathers behinde; they were clothed in
Coats with great wide &s;leeves; their Breeches
were long and &s;mall, made of even Sattin of

very richly; they had little black Boots,
gilded with &s;tripes of Gold; their Arms were
gilded; Sables with Bows and Arrows were
girt to them, with great rich embroydered
Scarfes, who&s;e ends hung over on each &s;ide
of the Hor&s;e; their Hor&s;es were goodly and
beautiful, with little heads, little eares, and
&s;hort bodies; their Saddles were all waxed or
gilded, the &s;eats being of embroydered works
or Tigers skins; the maines of the&s;e Hor&s;es
were twi&s;ted, or platted, with Silver and Gold,
the brea&s;ts and buttocks were adorned with
nets of Silk, who&s;e &s;trings hung low; they
had gilded horns on their foreheads, and were
&s;hod with interwoven Silke in &s;tead of Iron;
every Hor&s;e was lead by two Foot-men, two
great <HI>Quiro&s;ols</HI> made of fine linnen, and co|verd
above with red cloth, with fringe round
about it, being born before, and &s;erving to
cover the Hor&s;e, which vvas further attended

Sables or Svvords: And thus the&s;e Hor&s;e-men
rode by paces, from the <HI>Deyro</HI>'s to the Em|perours

Palace in very good order. The&s;e

which were the <HI>Deyro</HI>'s three principal Wives;
each of the&s;e Coaches were four fathoms
high, two fathoms long, and one broad, be|ing
beautified with Wax figures, and enameled
with Gold; there were three windows on
each &s;ide, and two before, being hung with
rich curtains; the entrie was behinde the
Coach, made like the gate of a Palace, with
chambers on both &s;ides; all under the win|dows
&s;eemed black Wax; the rands of the
wheels were gilded, and the &s;poakes finely
turned and in-laid with Gold; when they
moved, they &s;eemed to turn again&s;t a Look|ing
gla&s;s, by rea&s;on of the clearne&s;s of the
glittering Wax, which was goodly to behold;
The&s;e wheels were covered with pent-hou&s;es
very artificially and richly wrought, every
corner of them being platted with fine Gold;
the top of all, or cover, was black Wax, where|upon
the <HI>Deyro</HI>'s arms were curiou&s;ly done in
Gold; every one of the&s;e great Coaches, or
rather Towers, were drawn with two great
&s;trong Bulls, covered with nets of red twined
Silk, which were lead by four foot-men clo|thed
in white; each of the&s;e Coaches valued at
&s;eventy thou&s;and Tayles, a Tayl being full
five Engli&s;h &s;hillings. The train of Pages, all

clothed in white, that attended the&s;e Ladies,
was numerous, each of them having a gilded
foot-&s;tool, and a pair of Wax &s;lippers carried
behind them. Then followed twenty three
<HI>Norimons,</HI> or <HI>Palanquins,</HI> being made of white
Wood, and plaited with Copper, wherein
were the Servants of the&s;e three Ladies, each
waited upon with a great <HI>Quiro&s;ol,</HI> two Pages,

nine foot high, its cover being round, and in

Robes, and Wax Head-pieces, that carried
this ambulatory Pallace: Forty Gentlemen an|tickly
dre&s;&s;ed, although armed with Europian
Head-pieces, and Pikes gilded at the ends,
went before the <HI>Deyro,</HI> and the&s;e were of his

bearing in his hand a Shield &s;tuck full of Ar|rows;
then came forty great <HI>Quiro&s;ols,</HI> all co|vered
with fine white linnen, and belonging

evening came on, and an innumerable com|pany

and the in&s;olencies grew to that heighth,
that many per&s;ons of quality, who could not
get out of the throng, or were retiring to their
hou&s;es, were &s;et upon, and very many of them
&s;poiled and murthered: among others, the
Lord of <HI>Firandos</HI> Secretary &s;aw his Servant
robbed, and a rich Cabinet of his taken from
him, before his own face, while&s;t he him&s;elfe
had much ado to defend him&s;elf from the vio|lence

our Servants, to quit our &s;tage, and put our
&s;elves into the crowd, becau&s;e of the night,
and the danger to continue where we were,
which we dur&s;t not do without running the

<P><HI>SIAM</HI> is a famous and potent King|dom,
&s;cituate upon the continent of
<HI>A&s;ia</HI> eighteen degrees Northern Lati|tude,
where it bordereth upon the
Countries of <HI>Pegu</HI> and <HI>Ava</HI> twelve de|grees;
it extendeth it &s;elfe We&s;tward to the

Northward to thirteen degrees, making with
its bowing the Gulf of <HI>Siam;</HI> thence the Coa&s;t
runs again Southward to twelve degrees, and
leaving the Sea terminates Ea&s;tward upon the
De&s;art of <HI>Cambodia,</HI> and the Kingdoms of <HI>Ian|gonia,
Tangou,</HI> and <HI>Langjang</HI> to eighteen de|grees,
even to <HI>Ava</HI> and <HI>Pegu;</HI> &s;o that the form
of this Land is like an halfe Moon, and con|taineth
in its circuit four hundred and fifty
Dutch miles, one Dutch mile makes &s;ix En|gli&s;h.
This Country (which is in many places
mountainous, woody and moori&s;h, e&s;pecially
towards the Sea, although for the mo&s;t part
even and clay, and is likewi&s;e full of all &s;orts
of Bea&s;ts and Fowls, and Rivers repleni&s;hed
with abundance of Fi&s;h) hath where it bor|dereth

I&s;lands, Bays, Havens and Rivers mo&s;t com|modious
for the receipt of great and &s;mall Ve&s;|&s;els;
I &s;hall not particularize all, only mention
the chief River, as the mo&s;t frequented Haven
of the whole Kingdom: This River (called
by the name of <HI>Menam,</HI> or the Mother of Wa|ters)
is great, wide, and very long, its cour&s;e
being not known unto them. It pa&s;&s;eth from
the North Southward very &s;wiftly through the
Land of <HI>Ava</HI> and <HI>Pegu,</HI> and &s;everal Provinces
<PB N="123" REF="71">
of <HI>Siam,</HI> until that it di&s;charge it &s;elf by three
mouthes into the Sea of <HI>Siam;</HI> it partaketh of
the nature of tho&s;e famous Rivers <HI>Ganges</HI> and
<HI>Nilus,</HI> flowing once a year &s;o high that it co|vereth
mo&s;t part of the Countrey, making it
incredibly fruitful, and de&s;troying by this in|nundation
(which continueth four or five
moneths) all obnoxious vermin and creatures.
The greate&s;t mouth of this River, is that which
lies mo&s;t Ea&s;tward thirteen degrees and a half
Northern latitude; and in the middle of the in|let,
there is a great flat, or &s;and, a mile long, that
cro&s;&s;es the entry of the River five or &s;ix foot
deep at low water, but at heighth is fifteen or
&s;ixteen, and in the Winter moneths, when the
the floods are great, there is ordinarily &s;even|teen
or eighteen foot and more; great Ships
that go deep, are forced to anker at four, five,
or &s;ix fathoms water without this banck, the
ground being clay and good; but tho&s;e that
pa&s;s this flat at high water, enter the River
without any more danger of runing on ground
till they come to the Town of <HI>Banckock,</HI> &s;ix
Dutch miles upwards; then the River grows
narrower and more &s;hallow, Ships drawing
eleven or twelve foot water, being &s;carceable
to mount to the City of <HI>India,</HI> where they are
&s;ometimes forced to &s;tay till the moneths of
<HI>September, October</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> for water
<PB N="124" REF="72">
to return. The Country is generally well peo|pled,
e&s;pecially the lower part of it, being full
of Villages and Towns; the principal whereof
are <HI>Iudica, Picelouck, Sourckelouk, Capheng,
Soutcethay, Kephinpet, Con&s;eywan, Pyt&s;yay Pit|&s;idi,
Lydure, Tenou, Mormelon, Martenayo,
Lygor, Bordelong, Tanna&s;&s;ary, Banckock, Pypry,
Rapry, Mergy,</HI> and &s;everal other, all which are
governments and heads of Provinces; be&s;ides
the&s;e there are many Cities and Burroughs full
of people, which I omit as &s;uperfluous. The
City of <HI>Iudica,</HI> the Metropolis of the King|dom,
and &s;eat of the King and his chiefe&s;t No|bles,
is &s;cituate upon the River <HI>Menam,</HI> in a
little round I&s;land, encompa&s;&s;ed with a thick
&s;tone wall, about &s;ix Engli&s;h miles round; the
Suburbs are on the other &s;ide of the River,
clo&s;ely builded, and full of Temples and Cloy|&s;ters,
lying in a flat and fruitful Country. The
Streets of the walled Town are many of them
large, &s;traight and regular, with channels run|ning
through them, although for the mo&s;t part
of &s;mall narrow Lanes, Ditches, and Creekes
mo&s;t confu&s;edly placed; the Citizens have an
incredible number of &s;mall Boats or Prawes,
which come to their very doors, e&s;pecially at
floods and high water. The building of the
Hou&s;es is according to the <HI>Indian</HI> fa&s;hion,
&s;light, and covered with Tiles; but the City
<PB N="125" REF="72">
is beautified with more then three hundred
faire Temples and Cloy&s;ters, all curiou&s;ly
builded, and adorned with many gilded Tow|ers,
Pyramids, and Pictures without number.
The Kings Palace is &s;eated upon the River, re|&s;embling
a little Town apart, great and magni|ficent,
many of its Buildings and Towers be|ing
entirely gilded. This royal and admirable
City is perfectly well &s;eated, and populous to
a wonder, being frequented by all Nations;
and is likewi&s;e impregnable, as not to be be|&s;ieged
but &s;ix moneths in a year, by rea&s;on of
the innundations of the River, which covers
the Countrey round with its overflowings.
The Soveraignity and Government of <HI>Siam</HI> is
in the King, a Prince of a Noble and ancient
family, who hath been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this
Kingdom, and the neighbouring Provinces,
many hundred of years; this Prince is ab&s;o|lute
in his Dominions, di&s;po&s;ing of War and
Peace, Alliances, Ju&s;tice, Pardons and Remi&s;|&s;ions,
&amp;c. at his plea&s;ure; He maketh Laws
without any advi&s;e or con&s;ent of his Council,
or Lords, his will being the rule he walks by,
unle&s;&s;e his goodne&s;&s;e de&s;cend &s;ometimes to
coun&s;el with his <HI>Mandoryns,</HI> them of his
Council; the&s;e &s;ometimes deliberate upon his
Maje&s;ties propo&s;itions, and pre&s;ent their re|&s;ult
to him by way of humble &s;upplication,
<PB N="126" REF="73">
which he confirms, changes or rejects, as he
thinks good. He di&s;po&s;es Soveraignity of all
the Dignities and great Offices of his King|dom,
without re&s;pect of per&s;ons, noble or
otherwi&s;e, (except &s;ome of the Antiente&s;t and
greate&s;t Families) to &s;uch as have or may &s;erve
him well, whom he againe deprives of their
honours for &s;mall faults; &s;o that they are all his
Slaves and Va&s;&s;als, which the Great ones e|&s;teem
an honour, and put in their titles. The
King thus &s;overaignly di&s;po&s;ing of all things,
doth notwith&s;tanding nothing without &s;ome
appearance of rea&s;on, and conformity to the
Laws of the Kingdom, which however anti|ent,
he by his u&s;urped prerogative and power,
doth interpret and bow to his Arbitrary will
and plea&s;ure. His Maje&s;ties Court and Train
is exceeding great and glorious; He &s;eldom
&s;hews him&s;elfe to the People, and very &s;pa|ringly
to his Grandees and Officers of the
Kingdom, which happens at certain appointed
times and daies; when he gives them Audi|ence
he is richly clothed and crowned, &s;itting
upon a golden Throne, at who&s;e feet his Gen|tlemen
and Attendants reverently kneel, ac|companied
with three hundred armed Soul|diers
of his Lifeguard: All, as well Strangers
as Subjects, who have audience of his Maje&s;ty,
while&s;t they are in his pre&s;ence, mu&s;t conti|nually
<PB N="127" REF="73">
kneele, with folded hands and heads
hanging down; when they &s;peak to him, it
mu&s;t be in this humble po&s;ture, loading him
with titles and prai&s;es; his An&s;wers are e&s;tee|med
Oracles, and his commands unchange|able;
&s;o that he lives happy in all imaginable
worldly plea&s;ures, having many magnificent
Hou&s;es up and down the Kingdom, as al&s;o
other places, Tents and Pavilions: He eateth
highly, but his drink is &s;imple water, or <HI>Coco,</HI>
all &s;trong drinks being prohibited by the Cler|gy
and the Laws, and e&s;teemed &s;candalous.
His Maje&s;ty goeth ordinarily by water with
eight or ten very co&s;tly and fine Barges, each
with eighty or a hundred rowers; he &s;its un|der
a gilded Pavilion upon a Throne, accom|panied
with his Courtiers and other Barges,
to the number of three or four hundred, with
his Train and Guards waiting upon him; mo&s;t
of the great Ones follow the Court at &s;uch
times, each in his rich gilded Barge or Praw;
&s;o that the whole train of them is twelve or
fourteen hundred, and &s;ometimes more. When
he goes by land, he is mounted upon a gilded
&s;eat, and carried upon mens &s;houlders, the
train being ordinarily the &s;ame, all marching
in order and great &s;ilence; no body is &s;een in
his way or &s;ight, but upon their knees, with
folded hands, and bowed heads and bodies;
<PB N="128" REF="74">
this reverence better becoming a cele&s;tial Die|ty,
then an earthly Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Once every year, about the moneth of <HI>Octo|ber,</HI>
the King of <HI>Siam</HI> &s;hews him&s;elf by water
and land in &s;tate to his people, going to the
principal Temple of the Gods, to offer there
for the welfare of his Per&s;on and Kingdom,
the manner follows: When he goes by land,
the proce&s;&s;ion is led by two hundred Ele|phants,
each attended vvith three armed men;
the&s;e are follovved by many Mu&s;itians vvith
Gomnies, Pipes and Drums, and a thou&s;and
men richly armed, and provided vvith Banners:
Then march the great Lords of the King|dom
on hor&s;e-back, many of them vvearing
Crovvns of Gold upon their heads; and every
one vvaited upon by &s;ixty, eighty, or an hun|dred
men on foot: Tvvo hundred <HI>Iapan</HI> Soul|diers
follovv the&s;e vvith bright Arms and rich
Colours, and much noi&s;e of In&s;truments; then
comes the Lifeguard vvith the King's Hor&s;es
and Elephants, richly adorned vvith pretious
Stones and Gold furniture; vvhich is follovved
by many Servants loaden vvith fruits and pre|&s;ents
for the Sacrifice, accompanied vvith a
&s;vvet con&s;ort of Mu&s;ick: The&s;e are again fol|lovved
by many of the great Ones on foot,
vvith folded hands; as al&s;o &s;ome Crovvned
Grandees, vvhereof one carrieth the gilded
<PB N="129" REF="74">
Standard, and the other the Svvord of Ju&s;tice;
his Maje&s;ty follovvs next in per&s;on in his royal
Robes, &s;itting upon an Elephant, or el&s;e a
gilded Throne, carried upon mens &s;houlders,
and vvaited upon by many Lords and Cour|tiers;
the Prince, or Heir of the Kingdom,
follovveth him; and then in order the Kings
Wives and Concubins, &s;eated upon Elephants
in little enclo&s;ed Cabinets: la&s;tly the ordinary
Courtiers follovv; the vvhole provi&s;ion con|&s;i&s;ting
of fifteen or &s;ixteen thou&s;and per&s;ons,
having its rear brought up by &s;ix hundred arm|ed
men. But if the King go by vvater, then
tvvo hundred Lords, each in his Barge, &s;eated
in a gilded Cabinet, vvith eighty or ninety
Rovvers, lead the van; the&s;e are follovved by
ten extraordinary rich figured Pravvs, or Bar|ges,
the vvhich, as al&s;o the Oars, are all gilded,
each having ninety or an hundred Watermen:
The King is in the riche&s;t of them, &s;itting like
an Idol upon a golden Throne, vvith his Lords
in their humble&s;t po&s;ture at his feet: the royal
Banner is borne by one of the&s;e Grandees, at
the head of the Barge, in &s;tate. The King's
Brother follovveth next vvith his Train; and
after him his Maje&s;ties Wives and Concubins,
in gilded Cabinets and Tents, each in their
Barges apart: la&s;tly the Gentry, Courtiers,
Guards, and other Attendants follovv, the
<PB N="130" REF="75">
vvhole amounting to five or &s;ix and tvventy
thou&s;and per&s;ons. The River is bordered on
both &s;ides vvith Boats, and an infinite number
of People, vvho reverence and adore their
King in his pa&s;&s;age, vvith bended heads and
folded hands.</P>
<P>The Dominion and Revenue of the Crovvn
is great, amounting yearly to many Millions,
ari&s;ing out of in-land Commodities, as Rice,
Sappang, Tin, Lead, Salt-peter; as al&s;o the

are only &s;old by the Kings Factors to forraign

his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Siam</HI> will be found to be one
of the riche&s;t Princes of <HI>India.</HI> There are &s;e|veral
Officers appointed for the receipt of
incomes, who mu&s;t account every year, and
that exactly: Mo&s;t of the&s;e monies are ex|pended
in building and repairing of Temples,
in rewarding of merits, and defraying the
publick charges of the Kingdom; the re&s;idue
being brought into the Trea&s;ury, which is
<PB N="131" REF="75">
e&s;teemed rich and great. The Laws and Cu|&s;tomes
of <HI>Siam</HI> are &s;trange (though orderly)
in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of their Princes; when the
King dies, it is not his Son, but his Brother
who is Heir to the Crown; but in ca&s;e he have
no Brother, then indeed his Son &s;teps in by
cour&s;e, who&s;e Brothers do &s;ucceed &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively;
la&s;tly all the Sons of the elde&s;t Brother,
who hath reigned, follow by turns, the Daugh|ters
being wholly excluded any pretence to the
Government. But this order is not alwaies
ob&s;erved, the Scepter being &s;ometimes u&s;ur|ped
by him of the family who is mo&s;t power|ful,
and mo&s;t gracious with the people, which
is the pre&s;ent Kings ca&s;e; who having rai&s;ed
him&s;elf before his turn, cau&s;ed all his Compe|titors,
and their Adherents, to be &s;lain, to the
end he might peaceably enjoy what he had un|ju&s;tly
got, and leave the Crown to his Bro|ther
or Children after him.</P>
<P>The ordinary Ju&s;tice, both Criminal and
Civil, is admini&s;tred through the Kingdom ac|cording
to their ancient Cu&s;tomes and Laws,
by Officers purpo&s;ely appointed: But in the
City of <HI>Judica</HI> they have (be&s;ides the ordinary
Courts of Judicature) a Colledge of twelve
Councellours, with one principal Pre&s;ident,
which doth definitively decide all Appeals, and
other bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, whether Criminal or Civil.
<PB N="132" REF="76">
It is indeed permitted, though with extraor|dinary
expence and co&s;t, to appeal to the King
and his Council, who ordinarily confirm and
cau&s;e the former &s;entence to be put in execu|tion.
In this and le&s;&s;er Courts, all Civil di&s;putes
are brought in by Lawyers; and the cau&s;e be|ing
pleaded, and witne&s;&s;es examined on both
&s;ides before the Commi&s;&s;ioners, the Secretary
makes an extract of the whole, which being
writ in a Book, it is &s;igned by both Plantiff and
Defendant, or others deputed by them; that
done the Book is &s;ealed up, and kept by the
Judge till next Se&s;&s;ions; at which time it is a|gain
opened in the pre&s;ence of both parties,
and their debates heard, noted, and &s;ealed as
before: So that the Lawyers, by their &s;everal
exceptions, demurs and practices, do very of|ten
delay and keepe up the parties for many
years; until at length, after much &s;ollicitings
and expence, the cau&s;e is anew opened and
examined, and finally adjudged and ended by
a full Colledge. But in Criminal matters, as
injuries, robberies, murther, trea&s;on, or the
like, the guilty, or &s;u&s;pected per&s;on, is appre|hended,
impri&s;oned, and examined; if he deny
the fault again&s;t witne&s;&s;es, or great pre&s;umpti|ons,
he is forced by torture to confe&s;&s;ion; all
which being noted in a Book, and pre&s;ented
to the Judges, they immediatly proceed to
<PB N="133" REF="76">
Sentence and Execution; except in Capitall
crimes, &s;uch being re&s;erved for the Kings plea|&s;ure,
who either pardons, bani&s;hes, or cau&s;es
the condemned per&s;on to be put to death, ac|cording
to the &s;entence. Offences are ordi|narily
puni&s;hed as they are more or le&s;s hey|nous,
with ca&s;hiering, bani&s;hments into De|&s;arts,
&s;lavery, confi&s;cations, mutilation of hand
or foot, burning in oyl, quartering, and other
&s;evere executions. Where the ca&s;e is doubt|full,
no witne&s;&s;es appearing, nor no &s;trong pre|&s;umptions
again&s;t the accu&s;ed, &s;o that the Judge
knows not how or what to do, he then per|mits
both parties to try it out by common pur|gation;
either by ducking under water, hold|ing
their hands in boyling oyl, to go bare-foot
upon hot coales, or to eat a me&s;s of charmed
rice; this conjured me&s;s being made up into
balls, is given them by the Prie&s;t with much
ceremony; and he that can &s;wallow it with|out
ca&s;ting it up again, and behaves him&s;elf in
this and the other trials with mo&s;t courage, is
e&s;teemed mo&s;t innocent and acquitted, while&s;t
the other, whether accu&s;or or accu&s;ed, is mo&s;t
&s;everely puni&s;hed, according to the nature of
the crime.</P>

hundredth, fiftieth, twentieth, tenth, or fifth
man being levied, according to the Kings plea|&s;ure
and occa&s;ions. Be&s;ides the&s;e, the Gran|dees
have ordinarily &s;ome hundreds of men in
their &s;ervice, who wait upon them in the field;
&s;o that his Maje&s;ty can rai&s;e an Army when he
thinks good, of two or three thou&s;and men,
with two or three hundred Elephants, Victu|als,
Ammunition, and other warlike In&s;tru|ments;
for all this his Armies &s;eldom exceed
one hundred thou&s;and men, and not ordina|rily
forty or fifty thou&s;and, as his affairs re|quire,
either for offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive. His

merely armed with Bows and Arrows, Shields,
Swords, Pikes, and a few Guns: the hor&s;e

but ill ordered and armed, and yet &s;ufficient to
deal vvith their neighbouring enemies as un|skilful
as they are, though far &s;hort of our
Europian Ve&s;&s;els and Mariners either to fight
or &s;ail. The&s;e Mariners, e&s;pecially vvhen their
Princes have been brave, have conquered ma|ny
of the neighbouring Kingdoms and Pro|vinces;
but being all human things, they have
their vici&s;&s;itudes, the&s;e victories did but fol|lovv

<P>There hath of old been great vvars betvvixt

the King of <HI>Pegu</HI> pretending to the Monarchy
of the neighbouring Kingdoms, vvhich he
hath formerly had, and as yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth in

and the Rebel <HI>Cambodian.</HI></P>
<P>This Prince, as well as his Predece&s;&s;ors, is
kinde to Strangers, but re&s;pects and e&s;teems
the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> more then the <HI>Portugals;</HI>
which the late King &s;ufficiently te&s;tified, when
upon the taking of a Holland Yacht in the Ri|ver,
<HI>Anno</HI> 1624. the Spani&s;h Gally of <HI>Don Fer|dinando
de Silva</HI> was violently &s;eized upon by
his command, and re&s;titution and &s;atisfaction
made to our Company; hereupon he was for|ced
into a war with them of <HI>Manhila,</HI> and &s;uf|fered
much in his <HI>China</HI> voyages, which was
well recompen&s;ed by the &s;ea&s;onable a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of &s;ix Dutch men of war, which were lent him
to be employed again&s;t his Rebels of <HI>Patany.</HI></P>
<P>The King hath more then three thou&s;and
tame Elephants in &s;everal parts of his Kingdom,
<PB N="137" REF="78">
each attended by two or three men, wherein
much of his greatne&s;s doth con&s;i&s;t; for the&s;e
Bea&s;ts are very much e&s;teemed in <HI>India,</HI> e&s;pe|cially
when trained up to the wars, the re&s;t
are employed to carry Ordinances, Tents,
and Provi&s;ions to the Camp. The&s;e creatures
being great, very &s;trong, and &s;trangely docible,
are taken in &s;everal parts of the Country, and
di&s;ciplined as followeth: A Troop of fifteen
or twenty tame &s;he Elephants, which were
taken when they were young, are driven into
the Wilderne&s;s, with two or three fellows to
ob&s;erve them; the wilde ones upon &s;ight of
them, a&s;&s;ociate with them, one or two at once,
which are driven with the re&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly into
a great &s;quare building with high &s;tone walls,
and encompa&s;&s;ed on the out&s;ide with trees
which cover them; as &s;oon as the&s;e Bea&s;ts are
decoyed in, a great turn pike is &s;hut behinde
them, and gates to hinder their return; when
they are entred further into the &s;quare place,
the tame Elephants being brought up to it by
their teachers, upon notice from them, &s;lip
away through other gates for the purpo&s;e; &s;o
that the wilde ones being left alone, are out of
other little &s;quares, whereof one is in the mid|dle,
vexed and tormented with all manner of
inventions to make them angry and furious:
the above mentioned &s;quares are made of great
<PB N="138" REF="79">
thick po&s;ts, well nigh two fathoms high, but
&s;o far di&s;tant from each other, that a man may
creep betwixt them; &s;o that when the Ele|phant
with his running, turning and winding,
&s;eeks to revenge him&s;elf upon his tormenters,
they &s;ave them&s;elves behinde the&s;e po&s;ts; at
length, when the bea&s;t is weary, and &s;uffici|ently
tormented, thee is a great door opened,
into which he runs to &s;ave him&s;elf, which is
immediatly &s;hut upon him, and he re&s;trained
to a narrower pri&s;on, and is there bound to
two or three tame Elephants, placed for the
purpo&s;e; this done, they are led into a covered
hou&s;e, where cro&s;s planks being contrived un|der
the wilde ones belly, they are hoy&s;&s;ed up
with pullies, and left as it were half hanging
for &s;ome time; &s;o that with this invention,
and help of the tame ones, they are wholly
tamed in three or four moneths, and rendred
&s;upple and u&s;eful. The Court is for the mo&s;t
part pre&s;ent (Galleries being builded for the
Spectatours) at the taking and tormenting of
the Elephants, which is mo&s;t plea&s;ant to be|hold.
The&s;e Bea&s;ts are &s;ometimes taken in the
open fields, being environed with tame ones,
and caught in &s;nares and jins; but this way is
dangerous although often practi&s;ed; and both
&s;hew how fabulou&s;ly Writers have informed
the World in this particular.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="79">
A white Elephant (e&s;teemed by the <HI>Indians</HI>
a wonder in Nature) hath been found in <HI>Siam,</HI>
and no other known Land; it is e&s;teemed by
the inhabitants as the Prince of the Elephants,
and hath been &s;o treated by the Kings of this
Country, who have had of them in the Palaces
many times, and cau&s;ed them to be &s;erved in
&s;tate, often vi&s;ited them, and honoured their
Va&s;&s;als with more then ordinary re&s;pect. The&s;e
white Elephants have formerly occa&s;ioned
great wars betwixt the <HI>Siammers</HI> and their
Neighbours; and &s;ome &s;ixty years &s;ince again&s;t
the King of <HI>Pegu,</HI> who proving victorious, did
not only take the white Elephant pri&s;oner, but
obliged the King of <HI>Siam</HI> to become his Tri|butary;
which yoke the following Princes did
not only ca&s;t off, but gloriou&s;ly revenge their
Predece&s;&s;ours misfortunes. During my fir&s;t
re&s;idence in <HI>Siam,</HI> the then King took two
young white Elephants, but both died &s;hortly
after to his great grief. This Nation believes
&s;omewhat more then humain natue of this
creature, alledging they do not only re&s;pect
him for his whitene&s;s, but for his divine under|&s;tanding;
which appears in his pride and glo|rying
when he is treated in &s;tate, and of his
melancholy and &s;orrow when tho&s;e honours
are denied him, or that the black Elephant re|fu&s;es
him his obei&s;&s;ance.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="80">
The <HI>Siammers,</HI> as al&s;o the Neighbouring
Nations, are all Idolaters and Heathens, &s;o that
they have every where great and little Temples
and Cloy&s;ters for the &s;ervice of their Gods;
and the dwellings of their Prie&s;ts. The&s;e Edi|fices
are builded of Wood and Stone very Ar|tificial
and &s;umptuous, with guilded Towers
and Pyramids; each of the Temples and Cloy|&s;ters
being filled with an incredible number of
Idols, of divers materials and greatne&s;s, gilded
adorned and beautified very rich and admira|ble;
&s;ome of the Idols are four, &s;ix, eight, and
ten fathoms long; among&s;t the re&s;t there is one
of an unimaginable greatne&s;s, being one hun|dred
and twenty foot high. In the&s;e Temples
and Cloy&s;ters there are many Prie&s;ts and reli|gious
Men di&s;ciplined, and very obedient to
their &s;uperiours, being all &s;ubject to the Arch
<HI>Flamin,</HI> or Prior of the great Temple of <HI>Iudica,</HI>
who&s;e &s;piritual power is va&s;tly great, though
&s;ubordinate to the Kings. All the Clergy
(whereof there are in <HI>Iudica</HI> alone at lea&s;t thir|ty
thou&s;and) are clothed, without any remark|ale
difference, in yellow linnen clothes, having
their heads all &s;horn. The learned&s;t among&s;t
the&s;e are profe&s;&s;ed Prie&s;ts, out of which the
Regents of their Temples are cho&s;en, (who
are held in great e&s;teem and reverence by the
People) preaching, teaching, and offering up|on
<PB N="141" REF="80">
their Fea&s;ts and Holy daies. The&s;e are pro|hibited
the natural u&s;e of Women, upon pain
of being burned; but they may alwaies, and
at plea&s;ure, upon declaration of their frailty or
weakne&s;s, quit their frocks, and betake them|&s;elves
to another life, which happens often a|mong&s;t
them. They have their morning and
evening Song, Readings and other Services,
celebrated in their Cloy&s;ters every day, and
frequented by their &s;ociety. They live upon
the Alms and bounty of the King and great
Ones, as al&s;o on the fruit which their Church
Lands bring forth; but principally out of the
&s;weet and labours of the Commonalty, who
unanimou&s;ly &s;hare with them, they &s;ending
every morning &s;ome Prie&s;ts and Clerks out of
their Cloy&s;ters, with begging bags to receive
the&s;e donations and charity: Be&s;ides the&s;e
Prie&s;ts, there are a &s;ort of old Nuns &s;horn,
lodged in Chappels near the greate&s;t Temples,
who a&s;&s;i&s;t very devoutly in all their preach|ings,
&s;ingings, ceremonies, and other Church
&s;ervices, but all voluntary, being tied to no
rules or pre&s;criptions. The&s;e Heathens do
generally believe, (however differing in many
particulars) that there is one upper God, with
many le&s;&s;er Deities in Heaven, who created
all things: that the Souls of Men are immortal,
and &s;hall be rewarded or puni&s;hed according
<PB N="142" REF="81">
to their merits and actions; the good dwelling
with the God in bli&s;s, while&s;t the wicked are
tormented by the Devils that &s;educed them.
Their Religion is principally founded upon
the&s;e points, which have been delivered to
them in writing many hundred years &s;ince, and
confirmed with the te&s;timony of many holy
men, (who&s;e memory they wor&s;hip in their
Images, which they have &s;et up like &s;o many
le&s;&s;er Deities) who by their charity to the
Church, to the poor, and to all things that had
life, they endeavored to merit Heaven, and a|void
the dreadful puni&s;hments of the Devils.
Tho&s;e that are religious and &s;uper&s;titious in
the&s;e, buy ordinarily upon Fea&s;t daies, multi|tudes
of Birds and living Fi&s;h, bringing them
to the Temple, and there give them their li|berty;
e&s;teeming it a great &s;in to kill not onely
men, but the more rude creatures, fancying the
&s;ouls of decea&s;ed per&s;ons to be tran&s;migrated
into them: all other evils which Nature teaches
us to be &s;in, they account &s;o too, and are much
preached again&s;t by their Prie&s;ts. The chief
Ceremonies of this Idolatry are, as we &s;aid,
preaching, teaching, &s;inging evening and mor|ning
Prayers, and offering of Sacrifice, which
is done with torches, candles, incen&s;e, &s;pices,
and flowers at the altars of their images, which
in their opinion repre&s;ent the great God, the
<PB N="143" REF="81">
le&s;&s;er Deities, and holy Men, whereby they
think their wrath is appea&s;ed; to which end
they celebrate with much &s;olemnity at the
new, full, and quarters of the Moon, as al&s;o
&s;everal other extraordinary Fe&s;tivals, with a
fa&s;ting from any thing which hath had life, for
three moneths together, they pray for the &s;ick,
and al&s;o the dead, who being fir&s;t &s;uper&s;titi|ou&s;ly
&s;haven, anointed, charmed, and with
much ceremony, as weeping, cutting of the
hair of the head by the next friend, alms, pray|ers
of the Prie&s;ts, mu&s;ick, plays, fire-works,
and other &s;hows (according to the quality and
ability of the decea&s;ed) burnt with fire, their
collected a&s;hes are afterwards anointed and
buried near the Temples, a Pyramid rich and
magnificent being erected over them; &s;o that
the&s;e funerals are extreamly expen&s;ive to the
&s;urvivors, as well as honorable for the decea&s;ed.
The Prie&s;ts carry them&s;elves very moderatly
to tho&s;e of a contrary Religion, condemning
no opinions, but believe that all, though of dif|fering
tenets, living vertuou&s;ly, may be &s;aved,
all &s;ervices which are performed with zeal be|ing
acceptable to the great God, e&s;pecially
theirs, they being convinced of its truth and
innocency. This con&s;tancy of theirs makes
them not ea&s;ily to be drawn to any other per|&s;wa&s;ion,
which hath been &s;ufficiently attempt|ed
<PB N="144" REF="82">
by the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who&s;e indu&s;trious Prie&s;ts
omitted nothing for their conver&s;ion, and by
the Mohometans who are no le&s;&s;e zealous in
their way, though with little or no &s;ucce&s;s by
either of them, and yet the Chri&s;tians, as al&s;o
the Mahometans, are both permitted the free
exerci&s;e of their Religions in their Countrey.
However the&s;e Heathen be thus religious, yet
they fear and &s;erve (although contrary to the
opinion of mo&s;t of their Prie&s;ts) the very
Devils, whom they believe to be the authours
and cau&s;es of all evil, as the Gods are of every
thing that is good and vertuous: They adore
the&s;e unclean Spirits in their &s;ickne&s;&s;es and
misfortunes, celebrating their fea&s;ts with in|&s;truments
playing, and offering attoning &s;acri|fices
of fruits and living creatures: They are
&s;o &s;trangely abominable in their ge&s;tures and
actions, that it is not fit for a Chri&s;tian either
to &s;ee or write them; thus fondly &s;earching his
favour, who&s;e indulgences do but plunge them
deeper in their unhappy mi&s;takes and errours.
The people of this Countrey are rea&s;onably
well proportioned, brown and tawny; they
are none of the be&s;t Souldiers, though proud
and in&s;olent in their victories; they are mode&s;t
enough in their civil conver&s;ation, though na|turally
light, fearful, incredulous, di&s;&s;imuled,
deceitful, and very lying. The men are lazy and
<PB N="145" REF="82">
&s;low, in&s;omuch that the women, with their &s;laves,
are forced (contrary to the cu&s;toms of other Na|tions)
to labour the earth, and do mo&s;t of their
husbands work, be&s;ides taking care for their fa|milies
and hou&s;es, while&s;t the men follow their
plea&s;ure and diverti&s;ements abroad. They clothe
them&s;elves (both men &amp; women) thin, according
to the hot climat they live in; both &s;exes wear
painted petticoats, the men covering their upper
parts with a &s;hort &s;hirt with half-&s;leeves, and the
women with a thin cloth, both ends hanging over
their &s;houlders to hide their bre&s;ts: They wear
for ornaments gold pins in their hair, and rings of
the &s;ame mettal on their fingers: This is the or|dinary
wear, high and low being all of a fa&s;hion,
and not di&s;tingui&s;hable but by the richne&s;s of
their ve&s;tments, and the greatne&s;s of their trains,
which they much glory in: The Gentry and No|bles
have many &s;laves attending them when they
go abroad, &s;ome ten, twenty, thirty, or more,
according to their abilities and greatne&s;s; and not
a Citizen, or his Wife, &s;tirs in the &s;treets without
one or two of the&s;e &s;laves to wait upon them.
Their hou&s;es are builded according to the fa&s;hi|on
in <HI>India,</HI> of wood and reeds, and covered with
<HI>Coco</HI> leaves, or tiles; the floors are rai&s;ed three or
four foot high, their appartements being com|modious,
though but &s;lenderly furni&s;hed, only
for &s;leeping, and dre&s;&s;ing what is nece&s;&s;ary for
<PB N="146" REF="83">
their refection. Their diet is but mean, as rice,
fi&s;h, and herbs; they drink water, though on
Fea&s;t daies they indulge more the common peo|ple,
drinking ordinarily Arak, or Brandy-Wine.</P>
<P>They differ very much in their cu&s;toms about
marrying; great Per&s;ons need nothing but the
con&s;ent of their Parents or Friends, (the Prie&s;ts
not intermedling at all) the ceremony ending in
fea&s;ting and rejoycing. Husband and Wife may
part again at plea&s;ure, dealing their goods and
children without further circum&s;tance, and may
re-marry if they think good, without fear of
&s;hame or puni&s;hment. A man may keep as many
Concubins as he plea&s;es, be&s;ides his Wife, though
they are in &s;ome &s;ubordinacy to her, who&s;e Chil|dren
onely inherit, the other being contented
with &s;mall portions for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Great
mens goods are divided after their deaths into
three parts; one part for the King, the &s;econd for
the Prie&s;ts and their Funerals, and the third for
their Children. The common People have other
Cu&s;toms; the Bridgroom buyeth his Bride for
a &s;um of monies of her Father or Friends, where|upon
the marriage is made and concluded with a
little fea&s;ting; but they may divorce, like the great
Ones, at plea&s;ure, and marry again with the &s;ame
liberty. The Children deal their decea&s;ed parents
goods equally, except &s;ome little advantages for
the elde&s;t Son. They have many other Cu&s;toms
<PB N="147" REF="83">
in marriage and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, too long and tedious
to write. As for their Children, they &s;end them
to &s;chool at five or &s;ix years old, where they are
taught to write and read, and rendered fit for
Trades and other employments; &s;ome are con|tinued
in their &s;tudies by the Prie&s;ts their Ma&s;ters,
until they are called to Offices and advancements
in the State, and then they ca&s;t off the yellow
frock; others continue there out of hopes of be|ing
one day Heads of Temples and Schools, or
&s;haring in the Prie&s;thood.</P>
<P>The <HI>Siammers,</HI> who live in Towns and po|pulous
places, are either Courtiers, Officers, Mer|chants,
Watermen, Fi&s;hermen, Trade&s;men, or
Artificers, each one containing him&s;elf in his vo|cation:
The Country people brew, till, plant,
and bring up fwarms of Cattel, as Hor&s;es, Kine;
Swine, Deer; and dome&s;tick Fowl, as Geefe;
Peacocks, Ducks, Hens, Pigeons, and other
tame creatures, in&s;omuch that provi&s;ion is very
cheap, notwith&s;tanding the abundance of at
which is &s;ent into the neighbouring Provinces
for their &s;upply and u&s;e: They have Brick, Lime,
Wood, and all materials for building of Churches,
Forts, Hou&s;es, Ships, Prawes, Jonks, and other
ve&s;&s;els in great quantities. The divers Towns of
this Countrey have their &s;everal Trafficks and
Commerce; in the chief City the trading is very
good and free in its cour&s;e; the principal commo|dities
<PB N="148" REF="84">
are Choromandes and Sura ve&s;tments, all
manner of <HI>China</HI> wares, Jewels, Gold, Benjamin,
Gumlack, Wax, Sappang, Agerwood, Tin, and
Lead, &amp;c. as al&s;o va&s;t numbers of Harts-skins,
one hundred and fifty thou&s;and of the&s;e creatures
being caught yearly in this Countrey, and fold
with much profit to the <HI>Japanners.</HI> They drive
a great trade with all eating provi&s;ions, e&s;pecially
Rice, many thou&s;and Tuns being tran&s;ported
yearly by forraigners. This City, by rea&s;on of its
great traffick, is frequented by &s;everal Nations,
as the <HI>Indians,</HI> the more We&s;tern <HI>A&s;iaticks,</HI> Eu|ropean
Moors, and Chri&s;tian Merchants. The
King him&s;elf is al&s;o a Merchant, and hath his own
Ships and Factours trading to <HI>Choromandel</HI> and
<HI>China,</HI> being for that cau&s;e more favoured and
priviledged then any other Prince; he likewi&s;e
trafficks to <HI>Pegu, Ava, Jongoma, Langs-jang,</HI>
and other places, be&s;ides his negotiations at
home, all which bring him incredible profit, and
no &s;mall di&s;turbance to private Merchants, all
which do certainly manife&s;t the great trade that
is carried on in this Countrey. The Monies cur|rant
is of very fine &s;ilver, of a round figure, and
impre&s;&s;ed with the Kings picture; the kindes are
a Ticlas, a Ma&s;e, and a Fong, worth thirty pence,
&s;even pence half penny, and four pence Engli&s;h,
or near upon. They reckon ordinarily by <HI>Cattys,</HI>
each being twenty <HI>Tayls,</HI> or forty eight Royals
<PB N="149" REF="84">
of eight; and it is with this and no other coyn
that they handle and trade with, &s;ave that there
is a le&s;&s;er called <HI>Schulpkens,</HI> or little Sheels, wher|of
eight or nine thou&s;and go to a Fong, being
brought out of <HI>Manilha, Borneo,</HI> and <HI>Lequeo,</HI> very
u&s;eful for poor people.</P>
<P>Before the coming of the Netherlanders into
the <HI>Indiaes,</HI> the <HI>Portugals</HI> had great corre&s;pon|dence
and amity with this Kingdom, being in &s;uch
e&s;teem and honour by the King, that the Emba&s;|&s;adours
&s;ent from their Vice-Roys, Governours,
and Bi&s;hops of <HI>Malacca</HI> in <HI>India,</HI> were not only
well received by his Maje&s;ty, but richly pre&s;ented
by him, and many of the re&s;iding <HI>Portugals</HI> in this
Country advanced to great Offices and prefer|ments;
they had not only the free exerci&s;e of their
Religion, but their chief Prie&s;t had al&s;o a moneth|ly
pen&s;ion allowed him for his more &s;plendid &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence;
thus they pro&s;pered here for many years,
until the Dutch Company got footing among&s;t
them, and gained upon them from time to time,
by taking their Ships and interrupting their trade,
with <HI>Santhome</HI> and <HI>Nevagatain,</HI> in&s;omuch that
they are at pre&s;ent very low and out of credit, oc|ca&s;ioned
more particularly by their taking of a
Dutch Yacht by a Spani&s;h Gally in the River of
<HI>Siam,</HI> which the King took &s;o highly, that he re|venged
it with his Arms, which produced a war
between him and <HI>Manilha;</HI> and however the
<PB N="150" REF="85">
<HI>Portugals</HI> &s;eemed unconcerned in this quarrel,
yet they wholly lo&s;t their credit at Court, in&s;o|much
that the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Malaccas</HI> Vicar, their
chief Re&s;ident there, is debarred of his u&s;ual ac|ce&s;s
to his Maje&s;ty and his Mini&s;ters, whereas in
former times they were e&s;teemed the onely and
chief Merchants of the whole Kingdom. This
breach and difference between the&s;e two Nati|ons,
was fomented by the Dutch, and increa&s;ed
by &s;everal acts of ho&s;tility on the <HI>Portugals</HI> &s;ide,
who took many of his Maje&s;ties Ships and Va&s;|&s;als
at Sea; in revenge whereof, the <HI>Portugal</HI> Ve&s;|&s;els
were &s;eized on in <HI>India,</HI> and all the pre&s;ent
<HI>Portugals</HI> natives clapt up in pri&s;on, who were
after two years re&s;traint, upon a fictitious em|ba&s;&s;ie,
re&s;tored to their liberty; but this practice
coming to light, occa&s;ioned the &s;ei&s;ure of a <HI>Ca|&s;tilian</HI>
and a <HI>Portugal</HI> Ve&s;&s;el in the Havens of <HI>Li|goor</HI>
and <HI>Tana&s;lary,</HI> the men whereof were not
relea&s;ed till after a two years re&s;traint; but then
indeed returned with his Maje&s;ties Letters to the
Governours of <HI>Manilha</HI> and <HI>Malacca,</HI> with
invitations of their former peace and traffick,
where it is probable they may return, but que&s;ti|onable
whether they &s;hall ever recover their for|mer
credit and authority.</P>
<P>It is more then thirty years &s;ince the Nether|landers
came fir&s;t to <HI>Siam,</HI> and were admitted of
by his Maje&s;ty; &s;o that the Company have judged
<PB N="151" REF="85">
it nece&s;&s;ary, for the cheri&s;hing their traffick and
alliance with &s;o mighty a Prince, to &s;ettle there;
to which end they builded a hou&s;e, or lodge, of
wood in the City of <HI>India,</HI> where they trade in
in land commodities, and &s;elling of clothes, as
al&s;o buying of Harts-skins, Sappang, &amp;c. which
are &s;ent yearly to <HI>Japan:</HI> the Company indeed
hath not profited much, by rea&s;on of &s;everal
misfortunes by this traffick; but they have gained
more reputation then any Europians be&s;ides, by
the great friend&s;hip and corre&s;pondence which
is betwixt them and the King; and al&s;o have had
the benefit of tran&s;porting great quantities of all
&s;orts of provi&s;ions in <HI>Batamia,</HI> which friend&s;hip,
notwith&s;tanding the &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ions of the
Princes, di&s;turbing the Companies Cantore and
Servants, is yet &s;ufficiently con&s;erved and con|tinued,
and ought in my opinion to be cheri&s;hed,
as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the good and welfare
of our Company, as al&s;o in regard of the Kings
civil u&s;age of us, and his aver&s;ion to the Spani|ards,
our common enemy; finally our factory
e&s;tabli&s;hed there in the year 1633. and trading du|ring
my four years direction, are &s;o much cor|rected
and increa&s;ed, that the Company hath re|markably
gained by them, with probability, with
good mannagement of more &s;ignal advantages:
To which end the General and Councel of <HI>India</HI>
cau&s;ed in <HI>Anno</HI> 1634. a &s;tone lodge, with fit pack-hou&s;es,
<PB N="152" REF="86">
plea&s;ant apartements, and a commodious
landing place, to be builded on the borders of
the River <HI>Menam,</HI> being one of the conveni|ente&s;t
and be&s;t &s;cituated of any that is unfortified
in all the <HI>Indiaes.</HI></P>
<P>And thus much we found good to di&s;cover of
the cu&s;tomes and manners of the Kingdom of
<HI>Siam,</HI> being my ob&s;ervations during my eight
years re&s;idence in the chief City of the Country.
I have followed the exact rules of truth, accor|ding
to my be&s;t knowledge and diligence, in this
&s;hort relation, remitting the curious to the more
large and more particular di&s;cour&s;es of better and
more exact judgements.</P>
