<HEAD>To his very good friend M. <HI>Nicholas Gor&s;an of Trowell in the Countie</HI> of Nottingham, and the re&s;t of his xxv. partners for Ireland, giue the&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>_LET not the reportes of tho&s;e that haue &s;pent all their owne and what they could y any meanes get from others in England, di&s;courage you from Ireland, although they and &s;uch others by bad dealinges haue wrought a generall di&s;credite to all Engli&s;h men, in that countrie which are to the Iri&s;he vnknowne.</P>
<P>The&s;e men will &s;ay there is great danger in tra|uelling the countrie, and much more to dwell or in|habite there: yet are they freed from three of the greate&s;t dangers: fir&s;t, they cannot meete in al that land any wor&s;&s;e then them&s;elues: &s;econdly, they need not feare robbing for that they haue not any thing to loo&s;e: la&s;tly, they are not like to run in debt, for that there is none wil tru&s;t them. The greate&s;t matter which troubleth them is, they cannot get any thing there but by hone&s;t trauell, which they are altoge|ther ignorant of. The&s;e men cannot tel what good
<PB N="3" REF="2">
fruites England hath, the which Ireland wanteth, neyther can they iu&s;tly &s;ay, but that it lyeth better for the vent of all commodities then England doth.</P>
<P>What the&s;e men haue reported or what the &s;imple haue credited, that woulde rather beleeue a runnea|gate then trauell to &s;ee: I care not. But what I haue di&s;couered or learned in that countrey, I will herein recite vnto you.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, the people are of three &s;ortes, the better &s;ort are very ciuill and hone&s;tly giuen: the mo&s;t of them greatly inclined to hu&s;bandrie, although as yet vn|&s;kilfull, notwith&s;tanding, through their great trauel many of them are rich in cattel, &s;ome one man there milketh one hundred kine, and two or three hundred yeawes and goates, and reareth yearely mo&s;t of their breed.</P>
<P>Their entertainement for your dyet &s;halbe more welcome and plentifull, then cleanly and hand&s;ome, for although they did neuer &s;ee you before, they will make you the be&s;t cheare their countrey yeeldeth for two or three daies, &amp; take not any thing therefore. Mo&s;te of them &s;peake good Engli&s;h and bring vp their children to learning. I &s;awe in a Grammer &s;choole in <HI>Limberick,</HI> one hundred, and three&s;core &s;chollers, mo&s;t of them &s;peaking good and perfite Engli&s;h, for y^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter"> they haue v&s;ed to con&s;ter the Latine into Engli&s;h. They keepe their promi&s;e faythfully, and are more de&s;irous of peace then our Engli&s;h men, for that in time of warres they are more char|ged:
<PB N="4" REF="3">
And al&s;o they are fatter praies for the enemie who re&s;pecteth no per&s;on. They are quicke witted and of good con&s;titution of bodie, they reforme them &s;elues dayly more and more after the Engli&s;h man|ners: nothing is more plea&s;ing vnto them then to heare of good Iu&s;tices placed among&s;t the~. They haue a common &s;aying which I am per&s;waded they &s;peake vnfaynedly, which is, <HI>Defend me, &amp; &s;pend me:</HI> meaning from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the wor&s;er &s;ort of our countreymen: They are obedient to y^e lawes, &s;o that you may trauell through all the land without any danger or iniurie offered of y^e very wor&s;t Iri&s;h, and be greatly releeued of the be&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;ort being lea&s;t in number are called <HI>Kernes,</HI> they are warlike men: mo&s;t of that &s;orte were &s;layne in the late warres.</P>
<P>The third &s;ort, are a very idle people, not vnlike our Engli&s;h beggers, yet for the mo&s;te part, of pure complexion and good con&s;titution of body: one of y^e greate&s;t ouer&s;ights in the better &s;ort is, for y^<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="faint" EXTENT="1 letter"> they make not that idle &s;ort giue accompt of their life.</P>
<P>They haue the Engli&s;he lawes and gouernours as is in England: Fir&s;t, there is a Lord deputy ouer the whole land, that repre&s;enteth her Maie&s;tie, al|&s;o a Lord Chancellor, a Lord Trea&s;urer, a Lord chiefe Iu&s;tice, and all other Magi&s;trates, Officers and Courtes, in like maner as belongeth to We&s;t|min&s;ter.</P>
<P>The land is deuided into fiue great parts: that is
<PB N="5" REF="3">
to &s;aye. <HI>Mun&s;ter, Lan&s;ter, Conath, Meath,</HI> and <HI>Vl&s;ter.</HI> In <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> are the&s;e vit. great countries: <HI>Owrm|wood, Dea&s;mond, Corke, Waterford Typerare, Lym|bericke,</HI> and <HI>Carrey:</HI> a great part of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> was forfited to her Maie&s;tie by meanes of y^e <HI>Dea&s;mondes</HI> late rebellion.</P>
<P>There is two very riche countries called <HI>Kennory</HI> and <HI>Conelogh,</HI> both within the countie of <HI>Lemereck:</HI> they are called the gardens of the land for y^e varietie and great plentie of all graine and fruites, and al&s;o there is more plentie of veni&s;on, fi&s;h and fowle then el&s; where in Ireland, although in euery place there is great &s;tore. This land belonged &s;ometime to the knight of y^e valley, who for high trea&s;on was execu|ted at <HI>Lemerecke.</HI> Ouer euery part is an Engli&s;h|man liefetenant which hath authoritie as fully as the Mar&s;hall, to erecute Mar&s;hall lawes vpon the Iri&s;he offe~ders at al times. Al&s;o there are Iudges of a&s;&s;ize for euery circuit, who keepe their a&s;&s;i&s;es as our Iudges doe: if any matter be to be tryed there betweene an Engli&s;h man and an Iri&s;h, the Iury is half Engli&s;h and halfe Iri&s;h. There is a &s;heriffe of euery countie, with vnder&s;heriffes, Arrant Bay|liffes, &amp; al other officers appertaining. Al&s;o there is a conuenient number of Iu&s;tices of peace in euery countie with Con&s;tables and pettie Con&s;tables, who keepe their quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions orderly.</P>
<P>The countrey is &s;cituated &s;ome what neerer the Equinoctiall lyne then England, but yet for that it
<PB N="6" REF="4">
lyeth more vpon the Ocean &s;eas &amp; is full of Riuers &amp; &s;mal brookes, it is not &s;o hote in &s;ummer as Eng+land, neyther is it &s;o cold in winter, for that the &s;eas fretteth away the Ice &amp; Snowe there, much more then in England.</P>
<P>The general Map of Ireland, which is ioyned w^t the olde Map of England, is mo&s;te fal&s;e: The au|thour (as it &s;eemeth) drew them both by report, and the common computation of myles: and made his Scale after the Engli&s;h mea&s;ure, that is one thou|&s;and paces, or fiue thou&s;and footes to the myle: but therein he greatly deceiued him&s;elfe, for the &s;horte&s;t myles in England are much longer then that mea|&s;ure, and an Iri&s;h myle is longer then two of tho&s;e myles, by which meanes he hath made the Map of England le&s;&s;e by y^e halfe then it &s;hould be. Notwith|&s;ta~ding, he hath ouer reached in his nu~ber of pari&s;h Churches, and the Map of Ireland littell more then one fourth of that it would be, if it were truely drawen. This &s;eemeth &s;trange, and hath deceiued many ignorant in Geometrie: but alwayes take this for a principle, that the &s;quare of two myles con+tayneth iu&s;t foure tymes &s;o much as the &s;quare of one myle, and &s;o of al proportions from the greate&s;t to the lea&s;t: wherefore as much may be &s;ayd of the long myle which containeth two &s;hort myles.</P>
<P>Some mi&s;tru&s;t that the Spaniardes will enter the land, &amp; that the Iri&s;h wil releeue them: no doubt there are &s;ome Traytors in Ireland, I would I
<PB N="7" REF="4">
could truely &s;ay there were none in England: but this I dare a&s;&s;ure you the greater number, and al the better &s;ort doe deadly hate y^e Spaniardes, &amp; yet I thinke they beare them fayre weather, for that they are the popes champions, &amp; a great part of the Iri&s;h (for want of good preaching &amp; di&s;cipline) are greatly inclined to papi&s;trie.</P>
<P>But their intertaineme~t this la&s;t yeare among&s;t y^e Iri&s;h (notwith&s;ta~ding they brought the popes holy candles &amp; pardons) &s;heweth how they affect Spa~i&s;h gouerneme~t. Mo&s;t of y^e better &s;ort of y^e Iri&s;h haue read of their mo~&s;terous cruelties in y^e we&s;t India~s, where they mo&s;t tiranou&s;ly haue murthered many millions moe of tho&s;e &s;imple creatures the~ now liu|eth in Ireland, eue~ &s;uch as &s;ought their fauours by offering vnto the~ al y^t they had, neuer re&s;i&s;ting nor of fering the~ any harme. Wherfore I doubt not that y^e Iri&s;h are &s;o fooli&s;h to entertain &s;uch proud gue&s;tes knowing their tyrannie, &amp; hauing not &s;o well de&s;er|ued at their hands as tho&s;e &s;imple &s;oules who~ they &s;o cruelly murdered. Neyther are y^e Spaniardes &s;o vn wi&s;e to tru&s;t tho&s;e iri&s;h, who &s;o lately imbrued their hands in their bloud, &s;laying them as doggs in &s;uch plentifull maner, that their garments went about y^e countrey to be &s;old, as good cheape as bea&s;tes &s;kins. If you haue not the &s;ayd booke of the Spani&s;he cruelties, I pray you buy it, it is wel worth the rea|ding, I haue for got the title, but it is of a &s;mall vo|lume in quarto: it is written by a learned Bi&s;hop of
<PB N="8" REF="5">
their owne countrey about forty yeares &s;ithens in y^e <HI>Ca&s;talian toonge,</HI> and dedicated to their king for re|formation of tho&s;e cruelties: afterwardes tran&s;la|ted into Engli&s;h &amp; diuers other languages, to make their mon&s;terous tyrannie knowne to the worlde. When you haue read the &s;ame, conunend it to our Catholickes that wil be &s;aued by their workes, and yet will not giue God thankes at their meate, for that they will not once haue in their mouth y^e praier for our Queene, annexed to our v&s;ual thanks giuing at meate. I pray God open y^e eies of their vpholders, and let them &s;ee what the&s;e men gape for, which is no doubt the ruine and ouerthrow of her highne&s;&s;e, whome I pray God pre&s;erue. But none are &s;o blind as they that will not &s;e. The Catholikes are borne with for their con&s;cience &s;ake, yet from &s;uch con&s;ci|ences &s;pring all the Traiterous practi&s;es agayn&s;t her Maie&s;tie.</P>
<P>Although &s;ome of &s;mal iudgements (which thinke euery &s;oile good that beareth long gra&s;&s;e) haue fayled of their erpected woad crops, by meanes of their vn &s;kilfull choy&s;e of ground, yet a&s;&s;uredly the commo|dities of the countrie are many moe then eyther the people can well v&s;e or I recite. Their &s;oyle for the mo&s;t part is very fertile, and apt for Wheate, Rye, Barly, Pea&s;on, Beanes, Oates, Woade, Mather, Rape, Hoppes, Hempe, Flaxe and al other graines and fruites y England any wi&s;e doth yeeld. There is much good timber in many places &amp; of y^e &s;traight|ne&s;&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="5" MS="y">
and &s;o good to reaue, that a &s;imple workeman with a Brak axe wil cleaue a great Oke, to boards of le&s;&s;e then one ynche thicke, xiiii. ynches broad and xv. footes in length, &s;uch a board there is v&s;ually&s;old for ii. d. ob. There is very riche and great plentie of Iron &s;tone, and one &s;ort more then we haue in Eng+land, which they call Bogge myne, of the which a Smith there wil make at his forge Iron pre&s;ently. Al&s;o there is great &s;tore of Lead Ore, &amp; Wood &s;uf|ficient to mayntayne diuers Iron and lead workes (with good hu&s;bandrie) for euer. A barrel of Wheat or a barrell of bay Salt contayning three bu&s;hels &amp; a halfe of Winche&s;ter mea&s;ure, is &s;old there for iiii. s. Malt, Pea&s;on, Beanes, for ii. s. viii. d.

A fat Matto~ for xviii. d.</P>
<P>There be great &s;tore of wild Swannes, Cranes, Phe&s;antes, Partriges, Heathcocks, Plouers green &amp; gray, Curlewes Woodcockes, Rayles, Quailes, &amp; al other fowles much more plentiful then in Eng|and. You may buy a do&s;en of Quayles for iii. d. a do|&s;en of Woodcocks for iiii. d. &amp; all other fowls rata|blie. Oy&s;ters, mu&s;kels, cockles and Samphiere a|bout y^e &s;ea coa&s;tes are to be had for gathering great plentie: the Phi&s;itions there hold, y^t Samphier is a

pre&s;ent remedie agayn&s;t the &s;tone: you may buy the be&s;t Heafers there with Calues at their feet. for xx. s. a peece, the which are nothing inferiour to the bet|ter &s;orte of Lyncoln&s;hire breed. Their chiefe hor&s;&s;es are of as great price as in England, but carthor&s;&s;es mares, and little hackneyes are of very &s;mall price, the mea~e&s;t Iri&s;h man di&s;dayneth to ryde on a mare. You may keepe a better hou&s;e in Ireland for L. li. a yeare, then in England for CC. li a yeare. Al your commodities you may tran&s;port from y^e &s;ea &s;ide in y^e countie of Corke (where I haue prouided for eache of vs foure hundred Acres of land) to England for viii. d. y^e hundred waight, &s;o that you make the &s;ame ready about S. Andrewes tide, when the herring fi&s;hers goe home from Irela~d. The charg of which carriage for &s;o much as you barrell, you may &s;aue a great part through Cheapenes of the ca&s;ke, &amp; then wil y^e mo&s;t of your co~modities, viz. Butter, Chee&s;e. Bacon, Beefe, Honny, Ware, Tallowe, Corne, and Herring with diuers other Marchandize bee readie for the market.</P>
<P>The wor&s;&s;er &s;orte of vndertakers which haue &s;eig|nories of her Maie&s;tie, haue done much hurt in the countrie, and di&s;couraged many from y^e voyage: for they haue entyced many hone&s;t men ouer. promi&s;ing them much and performing nothing, no not &s;o much as to paie their &s;eruantes, &amp; workmen wages. They wil not let any terme, aboue xxi. yeres or three liues, and y^e demaund for rent xii. d. y^e Acre: this is &s;o farre

<P>Sir Richard Greenefield taketh a verie good or|der for artificers &amp; labourers: he wil let any poore man of hone&s;t behauiour a hou&s;e, xl. acres of land &amp; vi. milche Kyne for xl. s. the yeare, for the terme of three liues, and if any of the&s;e men after they haue bread on the &s;ame &s;tocke a &s;ufficient number of cat|tell to &s;tore their ground, doe deliuer their &s;tocke a|gayne, then &s;hal they pay but xx. s. rent for the re&s;t of their termes. And if any of the &s;aid Kine be &s;tolne, and the owner doe track which way they were dri|uen from has ground, the &s;ayd &s;ir Richard will de|liuer him &s;o many Kyne for them, for that the law is there, if you tracke any &s;tolne goodes into any mans land, hee mu&s;t tracke them from him, or aun&s;were

In the very midde&s;t of your grou~d you mu&s;t make a little lodge, in the which you mu&s;t haue eight &s;eueral hutches, &s;o placed that they may be alwayes open into the war|raine, in euery hutche you mu&s;t tye with a little chayne a tame bucke conny of the be&s;t kynde: then &s;tore your warraine with 64. of the better &s;ort of tame female con|nies, which is for euery bucke viii. does, euery weeke the fir&s;t quarter: &amp; then monthly you mu&s;t wa&s;h your trees with water, &s;o high as a conny can reache wherein you mu&s;t bur&s;t the garbadg of a conny. Al&s;o euery weeke you mu&s;t draw a peece of carraine at the foote of your payle in the bottome of your ditche round about your war|raine, by which meanes your conies will neuer offer to touche your trees, nor come neere the payle to &s;crap the~|&s;elues out. You mu&s;t feede your connies with the &s;horte&s;t and &s;weete&s;t haye you can get: you may giue the~ gra&s;&s;e, mallowes, cole wortes &s;ow thi&s;tles, the, tops of carrats, &s;car+rates, and any yeaths or weeds, they wil eate foure dayes in a weeke in &s;ommer, and two dayes in winter, but not aboue for feare of the rotte: yet let the~ haue haie enough at al times, you may fatte them with graines mixed with oates, bran, or French wheate: you mu&s;t giue your co~nies euery day one oate &s;heafe, which will alwayes keep them hearty, &s;ound, &amp; fayre skinned. I doe accompt your char|ges in keeping your co~nies to be xx. markes a yeare, that is your warrainers board and wages, viii. li. and the conies meate v. li. vi. s. viii. d. the increa&s;e at an indifferent recko|ning, wil be &s;euen litters a yeare: euery conie of the be&s;t
