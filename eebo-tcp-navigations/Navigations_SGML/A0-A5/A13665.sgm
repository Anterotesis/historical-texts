As we reade that <HI>I&s;is</HI> ariuing in <HI>Egipt,</HI> brideled that Countrey, and ordained good common wealths. How did the <HI>Scicilians</HI> honor <HI>Ceres,</HI> for that &s;he was the fir&s;t inuenter of wheat &s;owing, with other innumerable? Among all other, none in my iudgement is more worthier to be prai&s;ed, tha~ the fir&s;t finders out how to make &s;hips and ve&s;|&s;els nauigable for the &s;ea. <HI>Strabo</HI> writeth that <HI>Minos</HI> king of <HI>Crete,</HI> had the fir&s;t rule of the &s;ea. But <HI>Diodorus</HI> &s;ayth, that <HI>Neptunus</HI> had the Empire of it afore him, for he inuented the feat in rowing of boates, and made a nauie, and was made Admirall of it by his father <HI>Saturnus,</HI> and <HI>Plinie</HI> reporteth that King <HI>Erichthas</HI> deui&s;ed boates fir&s;t, and rowed in them on the Red &s;ea. Some &s;ay they were ordained by the Troyans in the narow &s;eas called <HI>Helle&s;pontus:</HI> &s;ome thinke they were inuented in the Engli&s;h &s;ea. <HI>Danus</HI> as &s;ome write, was the fir&s;t that v&s;ed any &s;hip when he &s;ailed out of Egipt into Grece. But for more a&s;surance, what &s;o euer their opinions be, as touching the beginning hereof, (as we rede in the holy &s;cripture) <HI>Noe</HI> was the fir&s;t inuenter or maker thereof, before the floud. The ingenious indu&s;try of man hath brought many things to a no|table and good perfection, as well in Co&s;mography and Naui|gation, as in any other arte or &s;cience: for no doubt, (as it ape|reth by this trauaile or worke of Co&s;mography &amp; &s;uch like,) the olde ancient writers, as <HI>Ptholomeus</HI> and others, were de|ceiued, in that they iudged this Newe found Worlde, or the We&s;t part to be vnhabitable.

<P>_I Doubt not gentle Reader, but that the de&s;cription of this pre&s;ent hi&s;torie wil make th&eacute;e to wonder, as well bicau&s;e of the varietie of things that herein then may&s;t Reade, as al&s;o of many others whiche at the fir&s;te wil &s;eme vnto th&eacute;e rather mon&s;trous than naturall. But after that thou ha&s;t &s;oberly wayed &amp; con&s;idered the great effects of our mother dame nature, I doe &s;urely beleue y^t &s;uch admiratio~s &s;hal haue no more place in th&eacute;e. Al&s;o let it not &s;eme to th&eacute;e &s;tra~ge the &s;etting forth of many &s;tra~ge tr&eacute;es, as Palme tr&eacute;es and others, with bea&s;ts of the fielde and foules of the Ayre, the which are cleane contrarie to the &s;etting forth of our Co&s;mographers and Anciente writers, who for bicau&s;e that they haue not &s;ene the pla|ces, and for the &s;mal experience and knowledge that they had, did greatly erre. But if thou herein &s;tande in doubt, then tho&s;e that haue trauelled thether, and tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> that were brought fro~ thence, can affirme al things here|in contayned to be true. Furthermore if that there be here in this booke any wordes that &s;eme to th&eacute;e rude or il placed, thou &s;halt therefore accu&s;e the feuer and death, (y^e feuer) which hath &s;o kept or cleaned to the Author &s;ince his returne home, that he had no lea&s;ure to peru&s;e his boke before that it came to the Printer, being prouoked to deliuer it at the commaundement of the Cardinall of <HI>Sens:</HI> and death which happened to <HI>Ambro&s;e de la porte,</HI> a good &s;tudent and well &s;ene in the Frenche tong, who had taken vpo~ him the whole charge of this pre&s;ent boke. Notwith&s;tanding gentle Readers, our good will herein hath not bene wanting, onely wi&s;hing for recompence, that it may be agreable to th&eacute;e. Farewell.</P>

<P><HI>_MY good Lorde,</HI> being &s;ufficiently en|formed, (how greatly) after the mo&s;te com|mendable and no le&s;&s;e great and paynfull ex|erci&s;e, to the which it plea&s;ed the King to employe and be&s;towe your prudencie (&amp; for|ca&s;ting witt) you take plea&s;ure not onely to reade, but al&s;o to &s;ee and taa&s;te, &s;ome fayre Hi&s;torie, the which among &s;o many cares, might recreat your &s;pirite and giue it a delectable libertie of his mo&s;te graue and carefull bu&s;ine&s;&s;e. I haue boldened my &s;elfe to pre&s;ent vnto you this my di&s;cour&s;e of a lon|ger farre voyage made into <HI>India America,</HI> o|therwi&s;e by vs named <HI>Fraunce Antartike,</HI> being partly peopled and partly di&s;couered by our Pi|lotes, a land which at this day may be called <HI>the fourth parte of the vvorlde,</HI> not onely by the withdrawings of our orizons, as by the diuer|&s;itie of nature of be&s;ts, and temperatne&s;&s;e of the ayre of the countrey. Al&s;o for that none hereto|fore hath &s;ought it out, &s;uppo&s;ing al Co&s;mogra|phers
<PB REF="6">
(yea per&s;uading with them&s;elues) that the world was lymitted in that which the el|ders to vs had &s;hewed. And although that this worke &s;emeth to me of it &s;elfe to be very litle to be offered before the eyes of your Lord&s;hip, not|with&s;tanding, the greatne&s;&s;e of your name will extol the ba&s;ene&s;&s;e of my worke: &s;eing al&s;o that I am a&s;&s;ured wel of your wonted cleme~cie, ver|tue, and de&s;ire to heare wonderfull things, that ea&s;ily you will iudge howe that my intention doeth tende to no other ende but onely to make you vnder&s;tand, that I haue no other delyght than to offer vnto you that thing, of the which you may draw and receiue &s;ome contentation, and wherein &s;ometimes, you &s;halbe ea&s;ed of the great and trouble&s;ome affayres which are of|fered in thys degree and office, that you holde. For there is no mind or &s;pirit be it neuer &s;o con|&s;tant, but that &s;ometymes is troubled with the quicke di&s;patch, graue and weighty affaires of a common weale. Therefore it is needefull &s;ometimes to ordayne as the learned Phi&s;ition doth to a pacient or &s;icke body, &s;ome chaunge of meates to recreate the appetite of them which by their infirmitie and &s;ickne&s;&s;e, cannot broke nor ta&s;te one kind of meate continually, be it ne|uer &s;o plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>This therefore is the cau&s;e why the ancient Philo&s;ophers and others did oftentimes with|drawe them&s;elues from being wrapped in or charged with the publike affayres. As al&s;o the
<PB REF="6">
great Orator <HI>Cicero</HI> witne&s;&s;eth to haue ab&s;en|ted him &s;elfe many tymes from the Senate of <HI>Rome,</HI> (to the great di&s;plea&s;ure of the cytizens) for to remayne in his countreyhou&s;e to be de|lighted in the ple&s;ant and Harmonicall melodie of the birdes. Seing then that among oures, as he among the <HI>Romaynes,</HI> for your &s;ingular erudition, prudencie, and eloquence, you are as chiefe and principall mini&s;ter of the triumphant common weale of <HI>Fraunce:</HI> and &s;uch a one as de&s;cribeth <HI>Plato</HI> in his common weale, that is to know, great Lorde, and a louer of vertue and &s;cience, therefore it is not without rea&s;on to imitate and folow him in this point. Euen &s;o (my good Lorde) as returning all weake and wery of &s;o long a voyage, I was by you fir&s;t of your grace receiued and welcomed home, which gaue me to vnder&s;tand and know, that you are the &s;ingular patron of vertue and of all tho&s;e, that folowe it al&s;o to my iudgement, I thinke I could not direct this my little labour to a bet|ter than to you, the which if it plea&s;e you to re|ceiue &s;o beningly as with a good &amp; affectioned will I do pre&s;ent and direct it, and al&s;o to reade and peru&s;e it, you &s;hal find in my opinion wher|in to recreate your &s;pirites, and to holde me yours for euer. Although that already for many cau&s;es I feele my &s;elfe greatly bound and holde~ to do mo&s;t humble and obedient &s;eruice to your lord&s;hip: to whom I be&s;ech the creator to giue all good lucke and pro&s;peritie.</P>

<P>AFter that we had refre&s;hed vs at <HI>Caape verd,</HI> it be|houed vs to pa&s;&s;e further, hauing y^e wind at North|ea&s;t, maruelous fauourable for to conducte vs right vnder the <HI>Equinoctiall</HI> line, the which we ought to pa&s;&s;e: but being come to the height of <HI>Ginney,</HI> lying in <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> the winde became cleane contrary, bicau&s;e that in that region, the windes be very vncon&s;tant, with raine, tem|pe&s;t, and thunder, &s;o that the Nauigation on that coa&s;t is very dangerous. Now the fourth day of September we arriued into this Countrey of <HI>Ginney,</HI> on the We&s;t bor|ders. But &s;omewhat far within the lande, it is inhabited with a very &s;traunge people, bicau&s;e of their Idolatry &amp; darke ignoraunce. Before that this Countrey was di&s;co|uered, and the people knowen, it was thought that they had liued like the <HI>Ethiopians,</HI> hauing the like manner of religion of tho&s;e of the higher <HI>Ethiope,</HI> and of <HI>Senega:</HI> but it is found cleane contrary, for all they that inhabite or dwel from the &s;aid <HI>Senega,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inhabi|tants of Gin|ney, to the Cape of good hope, are all I|dolaters.</NOTE> to the <HI>Caape</HI> of good hope, are al Idolaters without the knowledge of god and his law. And the&s;e people are &s;o blinded and ignorant, that the fir&s;t thing that they m&eacute;ete in the morning, be it birde, &s;er|pent, or other wilde or tame bea&s;t, they take it with them bearing it about them all the day, about what bu&s;ine&s;&s;e &s;o euer they haue, as a God or protector of their worke, if they go a fi&s;hing in any of their litle boates of bark, they will put it in one of the endes of the boate well wrapped with &s;ome leaues, hauing an opinion and beleuing that
<PB N="26" REF="35">
it wil bring them all the day good lucke, be it on lande or on water: neuerthele&s;&s;e they beleue in God, alleaging y^t he is there aboue immortall, but vnknowne, for that he will not be knowne to them &s;en&s;ibly. The which erroure differeth nothing from the error of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> in times pa&s;t, that wor&s;hipped diuers Gods, vnder the coloure of Images and &s;imilitudes. But yet this is a thing worthy to be noted, though it be &s;uper&s;titious and abhominable: that the&s;e pore, ignorant, and bruti&s;he men, had rather wor&s;hip corruptible things, than to be reputed without a God. <HI>Diodorus</HI> the <HI>Sicillian</HI> writeth, that the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> had the fir&s;t knowledge of the fained gods, to whom they began to vow, and to &s;acrifice. Al&s;o <HI>Homer</HI> &s;ignifieth that <HI>Iupiter</HI> with other Gods went into <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> as well for that they were there honored and &s;acrificed vnto, as for the whole&s;omne&s;&s;e of the Countrey. The like you haue of <HI>Ca&s;tor</HI> and <HI>Pollux,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ca&s;tor and Pol+lux, called the bright &s;tarres, and lanternes of the &s;ea.</NOTE> the which going on the &s;ea at the re|que&s;t of the <HI>Greekes</HI> again&s;t <HI>Troy,</HI> were vani&s;hed in the aire, and were neuer after &s;&eacute;ene againe, the which giueth opinion to &s;ome to thinke y^t they were raui&s;hed &amp; placed among the &s;tarres of the Sea: al&s;o many name them the cleare &s;tarres of the &s;ea, attributing their names <HI>Ca&s;ter</HI> &amp; <HI>Polux,</HI> to two fair &amp; bright &s;tarres. The &s;ayd people haue neither temples nor churches, nor other places appoyn|ted for &s;acrifice and prayer. Be&s;ides this, they are without compari&s;on much more wicked than tho&s;e of <HI>Barbarie</HI> or <HI>Affrica,</HI> in &s;uch &s;ort that the &s;traungers dare not aborde them, nor &s;et foote on land, but by pledges:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The maners and order of liuing of tho&s;e of Ginney.</NOTE> otherwi&s;e they would take them, and handle them like &s;laues. The&s;e Villaines or wicked impes goe all naked, &s;auing &s;ome &s;ince the time that their Countrey hathe bene &s;omewhat frequented, haue worne a little &s;hirt of Cotten, or &s;ome &s;uche thing, the which is brought them from other places.
<PB REF="36">
They make not &s;o great trade with bea&s;tes, as in <HI>Barba|rie:</HI> there is very fewe fruits, bicau&s;e of the drine&s;&s;e &amp; ex|treme heat, for this region is vnder y^e &s;igne <HI>Taurus</HI>: they liue a good many yeares, and yet &s;&eacute;eme not olde, &s;o that a man of a .C. yeares olde, would be iudged with vs not a|boue .xl. Neuerthele&s;&s;e, they liue with the fle&s;he of wilde bea&s;ts, without &s;&eacute;ething, roa&s;ting, or wel preparing of it: they haue al&s;o &s;ome fi&s;he, and great aboundaunce of Oy|&s;ters, more larger &s;ome than halfe a foote, but they are more dangerous to eate, than any other fi&s;he, they ca&s;t a liquor like to milke, and yet the inhabitants eate thereof without any danger, and they v&s;e as well &s;alte water as fre&s;he. They commonly make war with other nations: their weapons are bowes and arows, as the other <HI>Ethio|pians</HI> and <HI>Affricans.</HI> The women of this Countrey fre|quent the warre as much as the men, and they beare for the mo&s;t part, a large buckle of fine gold or other mettal at their eares, lips, and al&s;o on their armes. The waters of this countrey are very dangerous,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The aire of Ginney, is vn|hole&s;ome.</NOTE> and al&s;o the aire is vnhole&s;ome, for that to my iudgement, the South winde being very hot and moi&s;t, and familiar in that countrey, is &s;ubiect to all kinde of putrefactions, the which we f&eacute;ele many times in this Countrey. And therefore they that of our Countrey, and of other Countreys of <HI>Europe</HI> that tra|uaile to <HI>Gynney,</HI> cannot remaine there long, without re|ceiuing &s;ome &s;ickne&s;&s;e, the which chaunced to vs, for ma|ny of our companie died, and others remained a long time &s;icke, and with great paine they recouered their health. For the which cau&s;e we remained not there long time.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Maniguetta, a fruit much e|&s;temed among &s;pices.</NOTE> I will not omit that in <HI>Ginney,</HI> the fruit that is mo&s;t rife and common, and with the which the &s;traungers of &s;traunge Countreis lade their &s;hips, is named <HI>Manigu|etta,</HI> being very good, and wel e&s;temed aboue other &s;pices,

with the which the <HI>Portingalles</HI> make a great trade. This fruit commeth vp in the fields like an Onion. The other that commeth from <HI>Molucquer</HI> and <HI>Calicut,</HI> is not &s;o wel e&s;t&eacute;emed by a great deale. This people of <HI>Ginney</HI> trade with certaine <HI>Barbariens</HI> adiacent, golde and &s;alt after a &s;traunge fa&s;hion. There are certaine places ordained a|mong them, where as eche one of his parte bringeth his Marchandi&s;e, tho&s;e of <HI>Ginney,</HI> &s;alte, and the others gold molten in lumpes, and without any other talke togither, bicau&s;e of the &s;mall tru&s;t and confidence one of another, as the <HI>Turkes</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> and &s;ome of <HI>America</HI> with their neighbors, they leaue in the place before &s;poken, the golde and the &s;alte of eache part. This being done, the&s;e <HI>Ethiopians</HI> of <HI>Ginney</HI> if they finde there golde inough for their &s;alt, they take it away, otherwi&s;e they leaue it, and let it lie. The which the other &s;&eacute;eing that their golde wil not &s;ati&s;fie, they adde vnto it vntill that there be &s;uffici|ent: then they beare away that, that to eche one doth ap|pertaine. You &s;hall vnder&s;tande furthermore, that the <HI>Neigers</HI> hitherwarde are more ciuill and better nurtered than the&s;e of <HI>Ginney,</HI> bicau&s;e of the great re&s;orte of Mar|chantes that trade thither: al&s;o they prouoke others to barter for their golde, for things of &s;mal value, as kniues, gla&s;&s;es, and &s;uche like.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The trade of Iuorie.</NOTE> Al&s;o the <HI>Portingals</HI> trade and bar|gaine with the <HI>Mores</HI> of <HI>Ginney,</HI> be&s;ide other things, for Iuorie, that we call Eliphants t&eacute;ethe.

<P>LEauing therefore this parte of <HI>Gynney</HI> on our lefte hande, after we had &s;tayed there but a while for the infection of the aire, as we haue before &s;hewed, we kept our cour&s;e, coa&s;ting alwayes to the height of the <HI>Caape</HI> of Palmes, and of that which is called the thr&eacute;e poyntes, where as runneth a faire Riuer, able to beare great &s;hippes, by the rea&s;on whereof there is good trade all ouer the Countrey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A riuer or flud bearing Mines of golde and &s;iluer.</NOTE> and the which beareth golde and &s;iluer aboundantly in lumpes, and therefore the <HI>Portin|galles</HI> haue landed there, and being in fauoure with the Inhabitantes, they haue builded there a faire Ca&s;tle, the

There is founde a riuer that commeth from the Moun|taines of the Countrey named <HI>Cania,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cania and Rhe+gium riuers.</NOTE> and another more le&s;&s;er, named <HI>Rhegium,</HI> the which beareth or bringeth ve|ry good Fi&s;he, al&s;o Cocodrils very daungerous, as <HI>Nylle,</HI> and <HI>Senega,</HI> and they eate them as we doe Ven&s;on. I will not forget what was &s;hewed me to haue bene &s;ene neare to the Mine Ca&s;tle: a &s;ea mon&s;ter hauing the &s;hape of a man, that the floud had left on the &s;hore, the which was heard crie.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two &s;ea mo~|&s;ters like to man and wife.</NOTE> In like ca&s;e the female came with the next floud, crying aloud, and &s;orowing for the ab&s;ence of hir make: the which is a wonderfull and &s;traunge thing.

Being now by our iourneys come euen vnder the <HI>Equinoctiall,</HI> I minde not to pa&s;&s;e any further, without noting &s;omewhat.

<P>THE twentie &s;ixth day of October, being eight de|gr&eacute;es beyonde our lyne <HI>Equinoctiall,</HI> we founde an Ilande not inhabited, the which at the fir&s;te we thought to name the Ile of Birdes, bicau&s;e of the greate multitude of Birdes that are in the &s;ayde Ilande,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ile of the A&s;cention, an why it was &s;. named.</NOTE> but looking in our carde <HI>Marin,</HI> we found that before tyme it was founde out by the <HI>Portingals,</HI> and named the Ile of the <HI>A&s;cention,</HI> bicau&s;e that on that day, they ariued thi|ther. We therefore &s;eing tho&s;e Birdes flying on the &s;ea,

For if one had &s;tretched out his Arme they woulde haue re&s;ted vpon it, euen lyke tame birdes, and not one of them lyke to the birdes of our countrey, the which to &s;ome &s;emeth vn|credible.

<P>Furthermore in this Ilande there is a certayne kinde of greate birdes that I haue heard called Aponars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Aponars birdes.</NOTE> they haue little wings, and therefore they cannot flye.

<P>I thought good to &s;peake of this birde among others, for that there are founde a greate number of them in an Ilande lying towarde the <HI>Caape,</HI> of good Sp&eacute;ede, on the co&s;te or borders of newe founde lande,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Caape of good ha&s;t Ile of A|ponards and why it is &s;o na+med.</NOTE> the which was named the Ile of <HI>Aponards:</HI> Al&s;o there are &s;uch a multi|tude, that on a tyme thr&eacute;e greate &s;hips of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> going to <HI>Canada,</HI> did lade eche of them two tymes their cock|boates with the&s;e birdes on the brinke of the &s;ayde Ilande, and it is no mai&s;trie to goe into the Iland and to driue them before them to their boates lyke &s;h&eacute;epe.

<P>LEauing the&s;e <HI>Canibals</HI> for the &s;mall comfort y^t there was to be had, hauing the winde at South, we &s;ailed to a very faire Iland, di&s;tant fro~ the line .iiij. degr&eacute;es, the which is very daungerous in the aboording of it, for it is no le&s;&s;e daungerous to a front tha~ &s;ome great <HI>Cape</HI> or <HI>Promentary</HI> for that it entreth farre into the &s;ea, and for rockes that are about it, and ranged on the coa&s;t &s;ide.

Al&s;o when we went for to &s;eke fre&s;h water, whereof we had &s;uch greate nede, that &s;ome among&s;t vs were con&s;trayned to drinke their owne water or bryn, the which dured the terme of thr&eacute;e monethes, and the famyn foure moneths, we &s;awe there &s;o many birdes, and &s;o priuie, that we might haue laden therewith our &s;hips, neuerthele&s;&s;e we coulde not recouer fre&s;h water, vnle&s;&s;e we had entred very farre in|to the cou~trey.
