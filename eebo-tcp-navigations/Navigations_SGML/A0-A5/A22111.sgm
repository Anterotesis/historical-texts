<P><HI>_IT is a great part of Our Princely care, to</HI> main|taine and increa&s;e the trade of Our Merchants, and the &s;trength of Our Nauie, the one being as the Veines whereby wealth is imported into Our E&s;tate, and the other as principall Synewes for the &s;trength and &s;eruice of Our Crowne and Kingdome: Whereas therefore the Socie|tie and Company of Our Merchants trading the <HI>LEVANT</HI> Seas, haue by the &s;pace of thirtie yeeres pa&s;t, at the lea&s;t, had a &s;ettled and con&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Trade in tho&s;e parts, and haue had the &s;ole bringing in of all the Commodities of tho&s;e Countreys, as namely Currans, Cotton Woolls, Wines of <HI>Candie,</HI> Galles, &amp;c. Whereby Our King|dome hath bene much enriched, Our great Ships and Mariners &s;et on worke, and the Honour and fame of Our Nation and Kingdome, &s;pread and inlarged in tho&s;e remote parts: And whereas, for their further incouragement, the &s;aid Company haue had, and enioyed by Letters Patents vnder the great Seale of England, a&s;well in the time of the late Queene, as in Our owne time, priuiledge for the &s;ole bringing in of the &s;aide Commodities, with generall prohibitions and re|&s;traints,
<PB REF="2"> a&s;well of naturall Subiects, being not free of that Societie, as of all Strangers and Aliens what&s;oeuer, to bring in any of the &s;aide Commodities, contrary to the Priuiledge of the &s;aide Company:</P>
<P>Wee minding the vpholding and continuance of the &s;aid Trade, and not to &s;uffer that the &s;aid Society &s;hall &s;u&s;taine any violation or diminution of their liberties and priuiledges, haue thought good to ratifie and publi&s;h vnto all per&s;ons, as wel &s;ubiects as &s;trangers, the &s;aid priuiledge and re|&s;traints, to the end that none of them pre&s;ume to attempt any thing again&s;t the &s;ame: And do here|by &s;traitly charge and command all Our Cu&s;tomers, Comptrollers, and all other Our Officers at the Ports, and al&s;o the Farmers of Our Cu&s;tomes and their Deputies and Waiters, that they &s;uf|fer not any Currans, Cotton wooll, Wines of Candy, Galles, nor any other Commodities what|&s;oeuer, brought from any the forraine parts or Regions, whereinto the &s;aid Company haue v&s;ed to Trade, to bee landed, except onely &s;uch as &s;hall bee brought in by &s;uch as are free of the &s;aide Company.</P>
<P>Furthermore, whereas there hath bene in Ancient time, diuers good and politique Lawes made again&s;t the Shipping of Merchandizes in Strangers Bottomes, either inward or out|ward, as namely the Statutes of 5. <HI>Rich.</HI> 2. 4. <HI>Hen.</HI> 7. 32. <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which Lawes haue of later yeeres bene much neglected, to the great preiudice of the Nauigation of Our Kingdome: We doe &s;traight|ly charge and command, that the &s;aide Lawes bee from hencefoorth duely put in execution, vpon the great and grieuous paines therein conteined, and vpon paine of Our high indignation and di&s;|plea&s;ure towards all Our Officers and Mini&s;ters, which &s;hall be found flacke and remi&s;&s;e in procu|ring and a&s;&s;i&s;ting the due execution of the &s;aid Lawes.</P>
