<SPEAKER>A Friend to his natiue Countrey.</SPEAKER>
<P>_GOd &s;aue you <HI>Batauian</HI> gentlewoman, I am very glad to &s;ee you thus triumphantly &s;et in your throne of freedome, it &s;eemes the world goes better with you now then it did in times pa&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>The Batauian gentlewoman.</SPEAKER>
<P>In deede (my good friend) it is true that it is otherwi&s;e with me now then it was heretofore: for now (God bethanked) I am in my fir&s;t and pri&s;tinate &s;tate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it better with you now (gentlewoman) then it was? and are you as you &s;aid in your former ancient &s;tate? and how vn|der&s;tand you that? I pray you tell me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Batauia.</SPEAKER>
<P>My good friend, marke the particulars, as I &s;hall &s;et them downe plainely vnto you, and you &s;hall ea&s;ily vnder&s;tand it. I was long &s;ince, in former time a free State; but after that, I fell
<PB REF="3">into great &s;lauerie and bondage, and now at this pre&s;ent I am re&s;tored againe to my former liberty and free &s;tate. For when my fir&s;t founders came hither into this free countrey, which as that time belonged not vnto any man in perticular, but onely vnto tho&s;e that fir&s;t tooke po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof, and inhabited the &s;ame (according to the Law of nature,) in this free place they built me this hou&s;e, which was called the <HI>Batauian</HI> go|uernment, and at this time the Holland Common-wealth, wherin I placed my &s;eat or Throne, called freedome or liberty.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had you at the fir&s;t no &s;oueraigne Gouernour, that had the chiefe command ouer your hou&s;e, and hou&s;hold?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Batauia.</SPEAKER>
<P>The gouernment of my hou&s;e was committed vnto two States, cho&s;en and appointed out of mine owne people and in|habitants; that is, the noble&s;t and honourable&s;t men among&s;t them, and the be&s;t and greate&s;t Citizens and inhabitants of the &s;ame. The&s;e were the principall Commanders of my hou&s;e and hou&s;hold, who for the better gouernment thereof, made cer|taine cu&s;tomes and lawes for the &s;trengthening of peace there|in, and had a great care ouer the &s;ame, for the pre&s;eruation of the Common-wealth.</P>
<P>And in proce&s;&s;e of time, there was a principall per&s;on (as a King) cho&s;en out of tho&s;e two States, who as the chiefe&s;t of|ficer or high Steward, had the principall command ouer it and the common-wealth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then your forefathers in time pa&s;t were gouerned after a princely manner by a chiefe Commander.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Batauia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yea, Kings by name; as <HI>Veromerus,</HI> who was called the fir&s;t <HI>Batauian</HI> King, who notwith&s;tanding was but the chiefe man, among&s;t the principall per&s;ons of the Land, and had the fir&s;t command, and chiefe authoritie thereof.</P>
<P>So were all the re&s;t that &s;ucceeded him, Kings ouer my <HI>Ba|tauian</HI> Land, but had more authority to giue their coun&s;ell and aduice for the gouernment thereof, then power to command
<PB REF="3">and rule ouer it. For the other Rulers and States that were cho|&s;en out of the Nobilitie and Commons, had as much power or &s;uperintendance ouer the King, as the King had ouer them, who with him together ruled the Land. But the King had an vpper command, or highe&s;t power permitted him, but not by authority or power, of, or in him&s;elfe: onely in regard and re&s;pect of his princely name he was obeyed, and his authority allowed with great reuerence and re&s;pect, and yet he him&s;elfe neuerthele&s;&s;e &s;ubiect to the Lawes of the Land, as is ordinary in electiue, not hereditarie Kings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hereby I perceiue, that your hou&s;e (called the <HI>Batauian</HI> Gouernment) from the very fir&s;t originall thereof was a free Common-wealth, and your commonaltie, free people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Batauia.</SPEAKER>
<P>We were neuer &s;ubiect vnto any forraine Nations, but one|ly to our elected Gouernour and States, together with the lawfull and probable Lawes, made for the good gouernment thereof, whereunto euery man willingly &s;ubmitted him&s;elfe. In this &s;tate we continued long time before the Romane Mo|narchie, and were vnited vnto the &s;ame, and by her liued in peace, although the Romans had the &s;ole command and go|uernment of the greate&s;t part of the world, and yet they were content to account of my forefathers, as their vnited friends; acknowledging my hou&s;e to be a free State, and calling my hou&s;hold &s;eruants the <HI>Batauian</HI> commonaltie; and when they had any warres, and were aided by vs therein, they called vs their fellowes, and companions, (as <HI>Iulius Cae&s;ar</HI> did,) and which is more, e&s;teemed vs as their brethren, friends, and vni|ted neighbours, in regard of the great aide and &s;trength they found at our hands, to helpe them in their need again&s;t their enemies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then the Romans had no imperiall command ouer the <HI>Ba|tauian</HI> Countrey, when they were Monarches of the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Batauia.</SPEAKER>
<P>No. For my forefathers of <HI>Baetauia</HI> (according to their an|cient
<PB REF="4">Lawes) were &s;till gouerned by their owne people, which continued aboue an hundred yeeres, during the Romane Mo|narchie, vntill &s;uch time as their friend&s;hip turned into de|ceit, and extreame oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;eeking to rob and &s;poyle mee and my Land, with pretence to turne my freedome into &s;lauery and bondage, contemning our vnity, and wholly forgetting the forepa&s;&s;ed friend&s;hip and aide by vs formerly &s;hewed, and done vnto them. For which cau&s;e my forefathers tooke armes in hand, and began a lawfull warre, for the defence and &s;afe|gard of mine honour and freedome, whereby the name of the Romans, in &s;hort time, was wholy driuen away, &amp; cleane roo|ted out, wherein per&s;onally they neuer had any ab&s;olute au|thority nor gouernment. For the which my <HI>Batauian</HI> people were &s;o much honoured and e&s;teemed of, that as then they were called and held to be the authors of the freedome and li|berty of our neighbours, and other Princes, who likewi&s;e were vnder the &s;ubiection of the Romans: but I obtained my free|dome againe, and after that continued long in my free &s;tate, and was gouerned by my two &s;tates of the Land, vntill the &s;auage Normans came and inuaded vs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Was it then at that time that you began to be gouerned by Earles?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Batauia.</SPEAKER>
<P>I, but not as Soueraigne Gouernours, but onely cho&s;en as chiefe Commanders, to &s;erue in &s;tead of Iudges, wee &s;ubie|cting our &s;elues willingly vnder their command, e&s;teeming and holding them worthie to be our Protectors, and to haue the &s;uperintendance ouer our <HI>Batauian</HI> gouernment, but had no power (by authority) to alter the Lawes and cu&s;tomes, nor to rai&s;e tolles, nor impo&s;itions, without the con&s;ent and good will of the two States, but were bound by oath to defend and maintaine the Lawes and priuiledges of the Land, and to &s;ub|iect them&s;elues thereunto.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whereby it appeareth that neuer any Prince nor Earle had Soueraignty, or chiefe power alone, ouer you and your hou&s;e?</P>
</SP>
<PB REF="4">
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Batauia.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: for in the time of the Earles, there haue been &s;ome of them that by their bad gouernment and life, became oppre&s;|&s;ors of the Lawes and cu&s;tomes of the Land, and for that cau&s;e their authority was mi&s;liked, and they put out of their com|mand. As it happened to the Ladie <HI>Iacobe,</HI> Counte&s;&s;e of Hol|land, from whom becau&s;e of her di&s;orders, and wilfulne&s;&s;e in her gouernment, again&s;t the priuiledges of the Land. The command ouer my hou&s;e was taken away, and tran&s;ported vn|to <HI>Philip</HI> Duke of Burgundie, which <HI>Batauian</HI> gouernment in proce&s;&s;e of time, and by marriages, was changed and fell into the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and after that to <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t, Empe|rour of Rome, (who with the good will and voices of all the States of my hou&s;e) made ouer the <HI>Batauian</HI> Principality vnto his &s;onne <HI>Philip,</HI> certifying him of my priuiledges, and the na|ture of my &s;ubiects addicted vnto re&s;t and freedome, with an earne&s;t charge and warning giuen him, to haue a great regard and re&s;pect of the <HI>Batauian</HI> Common-wealth, and to gouerne them with a mild and fatherly affection: for that he e&s;teemed the &s;ame to be the be&s;t branch of his Crowne, which hee with Princely words and oathes promi&s;ed to performe; but the contract being made, and he hauing the authority in his hands, wee &s;traight found a great alteration in our <HI>Batauian</HI> hou&s;e; for that he being a Spaniard, both by birth and conditions, a great Prince, and very powerfull, and had the Soueraigne command ouer many Kingdomes, and Principalities, did not re&s;pect our <HI>Batauian</HI> liberty, nor once e&s;teemed our priui|ledges, but contrary to his promi&s;e, brake his Princely oath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>By this meanes your free State was turned into a bondage.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Batauia.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true, by this meanes my troubles began. For in &s;tead of naturall borne Princes to protect my hou&s;e, I got &s;trange outlandi&s;h wa&s;ters and de&s;troyers thereof, who therein made a fearfull &s;tur, with mo&s;t &s;trange and great exactions, cruelties, and tyrannies ouer our liues and goods; to the end he might procure the breaking of the ancient authority of my priui|ledges,
<PB REF="5">the weakening of my lawes, and the aboli&s;hing of my liberty: But I &s;eeing the beginning of my ouerthrow, the weake condition of my hou&s;e, and the &s;ubuer&s;ion of my peo|ple, was compelled to &s;eeke meanes for the pre&s;eruation of my maidenly liberty, again&s;t tho&s;e that &s;ought to &s;poyle and be|reaue me thereof; but finding my &s;elfe in a manner very weak, by rea&s;on that diuers of my principall hou&s;hold &s;eruants fled from me, and that I was almo&s;t cleane &s;poyled of my hou&s;hold &s;tuffe, yea and my &s;eat very neere taken from vnder me, which I had &s;o long held and enioyed from my ance&s;tors, for that the feet thereof were almo&s;t drawne and broken each from the o|ther; whereby in a manner I &s;at &s;o wagling, that I could not deui&s;e how I &s;hould &s;it fa&s;ter, by rea&s;on of my weake e&s;tate. But taking courage, I made meanes vnto my neighbours for aide; but where I expected &s;ecurity and &s;upport, (ere I was a|ware) I had like to haue been cleane &s;poyled: for by the aide that was &s;ent me, my hou&s;e, Court, and Throne, was rather in wor&s;e ca&s;e then it was before.</P>
<P>Whereupon my principall officers were by nece&s;&s;ity com|pelled to &s;eeke to marrie mee vnto &s;ome one, that by his aide they might haue meanes to helpe me and them&s;elues. But not long before I had had a good example &s;et before mine eyes, of another maide, one of my neighbours, who by her welwillers was per&s;waded to <HI>Handt-werpe,</HI> that is, to betroth her &s;elfe vn|to him that &s;ought to bring her to <HI>Val-loos,</HI> that is, to the de|&s;truction of her and all her people.</P>
<P>This made me (I &s;ay) to goe to my cro&s;&s;e neighbour, (who al&s;o was e&s;teemed a maide) to get &s;ome aide of her, to helpe to fa&s;ten my Seate, and thereby to hold a fit place to &s;it in; for without that, they pretended to haue broken downe my <HI>Bata|uian</HI> hou&s;e, and to haue made a bridge therof at their plea&s;ure, to haue gone ouer to my neighbours, thereby to obtaine the like dominion and power ouer them; and their meaning al&s;o was, vpon the old foundations and ruines of my <HI>Batauian</HI> hou&s;e, to erect and build vp a new Spani&s;h regiment, and to take my &s;eate from me, and to turne it cleane ouer, as if I had had no voyce nor command therein: which made &s;ome of my
<PB REF="5">fugitiue friends and welwillers to looke backe, and to &s;tirre vp my neighbours, who as then vpheld and maintained me in my right, again&s;t tho&s;e that thought to haue thru&s;t mee cleane out of it, and by my ouerthrow to haue ouer-runne my neighbors, which was done by the commandement of that Spani&s;h Earle, who as a fatherly protector was placed ouer me, according to his oath and promi&s;e to defend my maidenlike honour: but he &s;ought by &s;trange ruffians to violate mine honour, to ruinate my hou&s;e and Court, (which notwith&s;tanding was one of his faire&s;t palaces) and al&s;o my hou&s;hold &s;eruants, e&s;teeming all as nothing; and which is more, &s;ought to make my people &s;laues, without once re&s;pecting my <HI>Batauian</HI> &s;tate, which is a Demo|craticke gouernment. By this meanes (I &s;ay) hath hee by his vn&s;peakeable tyrannicall gouernment, and vnlawfull v&s;urpari|on, lo&s;t the rule and pretended right (by my old cu&s;tomes and ancient priuiledges) that he had, by the aide and helpe of my neighbours and friends that &s;tood in doubt of further mi&s;|chiefe to come, aided by the power of the principall and chiefe Iudge of Iudges, who after 40. yeeres troubles, hath redcuced and placed me in my former &s;eate of ancient freedome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gentlewoman, you haue now &s;hewed me the &s;tate of your old freedome, and withal of your troubles forepa&s;&s;ed, whereof you &s;ay you are now freed. From hence forth therefore &s;hew your maidenlike wi&s;edome, by calling to remembrance things pa&s;t, wi&s;ely to con&s;ider of things pre&s;ent, &amp; well to fore&s;ee that which is to come, and which concerneth you neere. Therefore let not your forepa&s;&s;ed blowes (by a deceitfull bright &s;unne-&s;hining time) &s;o &s;oone be forgotten. For that many times after faire weather commeth a &s;torme, you doe well to &s;it at your doore, to &s;ee whether it be cleere weather abroad; for in truth for the&s;e 40. yeeres together you haue endured many, and too many &s;tormie winds, mightie raines, hailes, thunders, light|nings, and fierie flames.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Batauia.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Era&s;mus</HI> &s;aith very well and truly, that indu&s;trious labour makes a man rich. So haue I (by Gods helpe) and indu&s;trious
<PB REF="6">labour, with defen&s;iue warre ouercome and with&s;tood the great force and power of my tyrannous enemie, and &s;uch as haue by him been ouercome, and forced to flee their countrey, and to liue like &s;trangers in other countreyes; I haue with their wiues, children, and goods receiued into my hou&s;e, and giuen them lodging therein. Whereby I got both thankes and furtherance, which to him was a weakening and enfeebling, and to me a &s;trengthening and fortification, which happened mo&s;t hereabouts. But he fearing further mi&s;chiefe, (perceiuing my fortunate proceedings,) was forced to &s;eeke to me, (who at the fir&s;t he contemned and e&s;teemed of no account; yea in a manner thought verily to bee his owne) to make peace with him, and to acknowledge me to be a free State, without once pretending to haue any right of gouernment ouer mee, and &s;o I once againe got my long contentions (and almo&s;t cleane lo&s;t) freedome into my hands. By the acknowledging and a|greement of my enemies them&s;elues, who iudged it to bee my lawfull right, which in truth happened and came to pa&s;&s;e by an accu&s;ation of his owne con&s;cience, and a compul&s;iue nece&s;|&s;itie, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a de&s;perate hope of neuer to ouercome me. The&s;e were the &s;peciall things that moued him thereunto, and not becau&s;e hee de&s;ired peace, nor for any good will that hee bare vnto the welfare of my hou&s;e, and hou&s;hold &s;eruants. Ne|uerthele&s;&s;e, I haue recouered mine ancient freedome, and hope to continue in this my maidenlike &s;tate, by his aide and po|werfull helpe that hath &s;eene my mi&s;ery, and hath euidently in the &s;ight of all the world holpen and freed mee from the Spa|ni&s;h yoake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>God be prai&s;ed, thanked, and glorified therefore, and to him mu&s;t you pray, and in him firmely tru&s;t. But it is commonly &s;aid, that where there is no care, there is no feare: for while that you are now free and in good e&s;tate, you mu&s;t bee carefull for your &s;elfe and your hou&s;hold, and that in twofold manner:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, to looke well about you, that you be not deceiued nor ouer-runne by tho&s;e from whom you haue been deliuered, and haue freed your &s;elfe from their bondage, becau&s;e they haue
<PB REF="6">done that they did vpon meere nece&s;&s;ity, and not for any loue they bare to you.</P>
<P>Secondly, that you mu&s;t bee prouident to prouide for that which is needfull and nece&s;&s;arie for you in time of need, that in time of want you run not to borrow corne of your neighbours to feed your gee&s;e withall: for a learned man wrote not in vaine, when he &s;aid, Happie is that Land, which in time of peace thinketh vpon warre. And another learned Philo&s;opher teacheth vs, that a man mu&s;t not tru&s;t his recon|ciled enemy too much: therefore now you &s;it quietly and free|ly in your hou&s;e and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, it &s;tandeth you vpon to fur|ni&s;h your hou&s;e well with 4. mo&s;t nece&s;&s;arie things, wherein the whole, and all the &s;tate thereof con&s;i&s;teth.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, you mu&s;t haue true, tru&s;tie, and prouident hou&s;hold &s;eruants, &s;uch as &s;eeke not their owne good, but the profit of the common State, and tho&s;e that will not lightly by them|&s;elues take any thing in hand, that may bee burthen&s;ome and hurtfull to the Common-wealth, and the &s;ubiects thereof.</P>
<P>Secondly, fit hou&s;hold &s;tuffe, &s;uch as is hone&s;t, nece&s;&s;arie, &s;eruiceable and furtherly in a hou&s;e, to bee v&s;ed for the &s;eruice of the Common-wealth.</P>
<P>Thirdly, good proui&s;ion of &s;uch things, as in &s;uch a hou&s;e (as yours is) are mo&s;t nece&s;&s;arie and conuenient, as Che&s;ts, Ware-hou&s;es, and &s;ellers, well furni&s;hed.</P>
<P>Fourthly, and la&s;tly, you mu&s;t &s;pecially bee prouided of that wherewith you may doe mo&s;t, and which by men is mo&s;t de&s;i|red, for that thereby you may get what&s;oeuer you will, yea and almo&s;t as much as you will.</P>
<P>All this is needfull for you to doe, whereof you are to haue a great care to bee prouided, that again&s;t an a&s;&s;ault, or a hard and bad time, you may helpe your &s;elfe, by your &s;elfe.</P>
<P>Al&s;o it is conuenient for the female kind (&s;pecially a free maide as you are,) not to haue too much conuer&s;ation with &s;trange men, &s;pecially with &s;uch as in times pa&s;t &s;ought to vio|late your cha&s;titie; yet I doubt not of your good behauiour in any wi&s;e, becau&s;e you haue already with&s;tood many a&s;|&s;aults, and by meanes of your hone&s;t minde and courage,
<PB REF="7">haue hitherto ouercome all &s;tormes what&s;oeuer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Batauia.</SPEAKER>
<P>My good friend, I am warned to bee watchfull, but I hope God will pre&s;erue and defend both me and my hou&s;hold.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t, I haue true and prouident hou&s;hold &s;eruants, in my <HI>Batauian</HI> dominion, (according to the ancient manner) fir&s;t, an ouer&s;eer of the hou&s;e, (called father of the Countrey,) then my two States, the noble&s;t per&s;ons of the Land, and the men of greate&s;t account among the Commons, who haue all the care, and &s;peciall charge of the &s;tate of my hou&s;e, both in peace and warre. Secondly, I haue conuenient and profitable hou&s;hold &s;tuffe, as good coun&s;ell, and vpright dealing, where|with my <HI>Batauian</HI> hou&s;e is furni&s;hed, as with a heauenly and bright &s;hining light, thereby to behold things pa&s;t, to marke things pre&s;ent, and to fore&s;ee things to come. The other are as in&s;truments in needfull and profitable things, to &s;erue the &s;tate of the Land, (each one according to his qualitie and conditi|on) when time &s;hall require. Thirdly, (God bee prai&s;ed) my hou&s;e is well prouided, (and daily more and more &s;hall be) of that which &s;hall &s;erue for the Common-wealth, and &s;uch as my hou&s;holding requireth. Fir&s;t, my Che&s;ts and Wardrops are well furni&s;hed with apparell of all &s;orts; that is, of good iron dublets, &s;teele gloues, &s;tiffe &s;hining collars, with the appurte|nances, all faire and well kept, that when I haue need of them they are readie at hand; my warehou&s;es are well prouided of fireage, which is made of black wood coales, brim&s;tone, &amp; falt|peter, therewith ea&s;ily to &s;et fire on my turfe, which are round, and as hard as iron, and great heauie fiery arrowes, wherewith to make a good fire again&s;t winter and hard fro&s;ts. And for my &s;ellars, I haue yet a great many bra&s;&s;e ve&s;&s;els therein, to wel|come &s;uch as come to vi&s;it me, honourably; and in diuers ca|ges I haue many old gee&s;e, that when there is a faire, I may &s;et &s;ome of them before my friends to welcome them withall. Now for that wherewith I can doe mo&s;t, (which is money) I haue my vnited Commons, which are foure faithfull and tru|&s;tie labourers; that is, Husbandmen, Burgers of townes, Say|lors, and Souldiers, (who at this time for a while are at their
<PB REF="7">re&s;t, and liue quietly.) The&s;e are all fa&s;t bound together with the band of vnitie, and are they that at all times wil make pro|ui&s;ion for my <HI>Batauian</HI> hou&s;e, and Hollands garden, what&s;oe|uer I &s;hall want. For my Husbandmen at this pre&s;ent are well prouided of corne, and other nece&s;&s;aries, and &s;ell it as deare, al|mo&s;t, as they will or can, which al&s;o is apparant by the deck|ing of his wi&s;e and children with gold and &s;iluer which they daily weare. The towne&s;men al&s;o build great and high hou&s;es, which within are richly furni&s;hed with excellent faire hou&s;|hold &s;tuffe and moueables; as Tapi&s;trie, &s;iluer, and guilt plate, and hee him&s;elfe, and his wife and children, richly apparelled and &s;mugd vp in &s;ilke and veluet, laid on with gold and &s;iluer lace, making great bankets; all which are &s;ignes of pro&s;perity, and are euery one indu&s;trious to maintaine them&s;elues in good e&s;tate; &s;ome by v&s;urie, others by trade at home, and &s;ome by merchandi&s;ing, euery man &s;triuing not to bee the lea&s;t a|mong&s;t the re&s;t. The Sailor &s;aileth farre and wide for &s;trange merchandize; and if a rouer &s;ets vpon him at &s;ea, hee can play his part &s;o well, that he &s;hall get nothing at his hands; and ma|ny times lookes him&s;elfe for &s;uch a prize, &s;o that it oft falleth out that he can &s;aile with a by-legger, better the~ he doth when he &s;aileth before the winde. But the Souldier likes not of this &s;leepie calme weather, hee rather de&s;ires to bee ru&s;tling in the field, to &s;hew him&s;elfe a gallant. But the other three are very rich, and haue great meanes to helpe me, (I could not know it &s;o well, but that they by their &s;uperfluitie makes it manife&s;t to all men) for which cau&s;e I and my hou&s;hold are bound to haue a great care for them, and the Common wealth, for that they without me, and I without them, would bee a meanes to ouer|throw both me and my hou&s;e, and al&s;o the commonaltie, and euery one of them in their perticular &s;tates would come to nothing. For if the band of vnitie &s;hould breake, or by con|tention become loo&s;e, it would bee their de&s;truction, and my ouerthrow out of my Throne.</P>

<PB REF="8">of the apple whereof <HI>Eua</HI> and <HI>Adam</HI> ate in Paradi&s;e, which then pre&s;ently cau&s;ed great contention betweene God and them, and &s;o it did now al&s;o; for who&s;oeuer did eate thereof, thought that they were as wi&s;e as God, and knew all things, and for that cau&s;e thinking them&s;elues to be wi&s;e in their own conceits, they fell at &s;trife with their neighbours; but rea&s;on weeded out as much thereof as hee could, and in &s;tead thereof planted a root called <HI>Part &s;trife,</HI> which in time will grow to be a great hearbe, but the diuels <HI>Nay-thrid,</HI> ran almo&s;t cleane through the whole garden, and hath made the <HI>Orange tree</HI> for certaine yeers to &s;tand &s;til at a bay, and not to blo&s;&s;ome, which maketh many heere among&s;t vs to long for &s;ome of his fruit, if it were to be had; but the earth of my garden is &s;o rich and fruitful, that if once a hot Spani&s;h &s;un-&s;hine &s;hould fall theron, (after the which a <HI>Batauian</HI> &s;troke-raine v&s;eth to follow) we &s;hould pre&s;ently &s;ee the blo&s;&s;omes and fruit of the <HI>Orange tree</HI> &s;hew forth the~&s;elues.

<P>Gentletwoman, Doe you perceiue that which I &s;ee there, which is a &s;trange &s;how, it &s;eemeth to bee a twin, or a body of two kindes, whereof the one halfe before &s;eemeth to laugh friendly vpon you, with a &s;weet womanlike face; and the o|ther halfe behinde, is armed with a cruell &s;ouldiers looke, and hath a mon&s;trous great bea&s;t by him, wherein I take no plea|&s;ure.</P>

<SPEAKER>Batauia.</SPEAKER>
<P>This partie hath been heere &s;ome few yeeres &s;ince, and brought that bea&s;t with him into our <HI>Batauian</HI> hou&s;e; but what &s;hall I doe, &s;eeing he lookes &s;o &s;milingly vpon me, whe|ther it be in outward &s;hew, or in action, I will not as yet quar|rell with him and mi&s;tru&s;t him, before he leaues laughing, and then I will &s;ee, (and al&s;o aske him) what hee meaneth to doe, that he commeth here into my garden with &s;uch a hinder part, and &s;o faire and plea&s;ant a forepart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Doe you not thinke that he can &s;oone turne that laughing countenance behind him from you, and place the bitter looke before: It was wont to be the Italian manner, and the Spani&s;h cu&s;tome: &s;ee you not that hee hath turned the hinder part of his face towards a troupe of &s;ouldiers, and the forepart towards you; the while that he with outward flearing face lookes on you: with the hinder part hee doth expect your ouerthrow; therefore it is fit that the Lion &s;hould take good heed vnto him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Batauia.</SPEAKER>
<P>But (my friend) doe you know what manner of man this is,
<PB REF="9">and doe you know the bea&s;t well? I haue long time ca&s;t mine eyes thereon: let me heare what your iudgement is of him, &s;ee|ing you &s;hew your &s;elfe to bee &s;o carefull for me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>The happine&s;&s;e of your &s;tate makes mee &s;o carefull for you, but in my iudgment this man is one of the foure &s;orts or kinds of <HI>Hermaphrodites,</HI> (which are both men and women,) which is one of the wor&s;t kind of creatures that are liuing vpon the earth, if they may (without re&s;traint) v&s;e and &s;hew forth their nature. For they can &s;uffer them&s;elues to be dealt withall in na|ture of weake and effeminate women, with faire &s;hewes, and &s;weet words to deceiue withall; and as a woman by nature is milde, they can bring their &s;ubtill practi&s;es, and deceitfull charmes to pa&s;&s;e, which if they effect not in two or three yeeres, they doe it in 6. or 8. and &s;omtimes in 10. or twelue.</P>
<P>Againe, the&s;e <HI>Hermophrodites</HI> (when they li&s;t) can bee like cruell and &s;turdie men, and can as well by force as by craft bring many things to pa&s;&s;e, for they are without all mea&s;ure wicked and hollow hearted.</P>
<P>Which for you (being a maide) is very dangerous, for thin|king to &s;ee a womanlike face, and to heare an effeminate voyce, you &s;hould with the turning of an hand fall into a &s;nare, and be deflowred, whereby your mo&s;t noble and great fame &s;hould be ouerthrowne, and your prai&s;e-worthie name cleane defaced.</P>
<P><HI>Batauia,</HI> this is my iudgement, and a forewarning for you concerning this per&s;on, and where you thinke this great &s;weet &s;hining no&s;egay to be a Palme branch, it is not &s;o; for it is a branch of a hearbe called <HI>Munkes hood,</HI> a venomous hearbe, which heretofore was rooted out of your garden, which hee hath taken vp again, therewith to bring you at length into a &s;ound &s;leepe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Batauia.</SPEAKER>
<P>What thinke you of that mon&s;trous bea&s;t, what bea&s;t, and of what kinde and nature is it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>That may well and ea&s;ily be &s;eene and iudged by the &s;peck|led
<PB REF="10">skin that it hath, which is like a <HI>Nay-ed</HI> or patcht Monkes gowne; and therefore I thinke that it is naturally a <HI>Leopard,</HI> which is a greedie blood &s;ucking bea&s;t, begotten of a <HI>Lione&s;&s;e,</HI> by a <HI>Panther;</HI> and therefore it is called by a double &s;ignifying name, a <HI>Leopard.</HI> This bea&s;t although it is brought forth by a &s;hee <HI>Lion,</HI> yet it is mo&s;t greedie and eruelly bent to &s;eeke the de&s;truction of the male <HI>Lion:</HI> but as it is bloodily minded, &s;o it is &s;ubtill and craftie, &s;pecially to intrap his greate&s;t enemy the <HI>Lion,</HI> therby to fall vpon him and to de&s;troy him: to the which end he is skilfull how to make double holes, one aboue the o|ther, which run both into one, being wide aboue, and narrow or &s;traite in the middle, whereinto he runneth, to get the <HI>Lion</HI> (following him) betweene them both, and &s;o to entangle him|&s;elfe therein; in the meane time the <HI>Leopard</HI> leapes out at the other hole, and falleth vpon the backe of the <HI>Lion,</HI> for by that meanes the <HI>Lion</HI> cannot v&s;e his &s;trength again&s;t him; and &s;o he &s;heweth his deceitfull nature and condition, which by &s;ub|tiltie he practi&s;eth and bringeth to pa&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>And yet at other times he hath &s;hewed other <HI>Leopards</HI> tricks vpon the African <HI>Apes,</HI> and We&s;t-Indian <HI>Monkeyes:</HI> for vpon a time when hee &s;pied many of them together, hee made as though he had been dead, or a&s;leepe; in the meane time the <HI>Apes</HI> and <HI>Monkeyes</HI> came without feare out of their holes, (thinking to be free &amp; out of doubt) and were very ioyful, and played many api&s;h toyes one with the other, not doubting any thing, nor once &s;o much as dreaming of the ri&s;ing vp againe of their &s;lumbring enemie, who like a <HI>Leopard</HI> lay lurking, and &s;eeing time fit and conuenient, when tho&s;e bea&s;ts were vnar|med, and without feare, he ro&s;e vp out of his counterfeit &s;lum|ber, and falling vpon them, deuoured and tare in &s;under the mo&s;t part of them. This (Gentlewoman) &s;erueth al&s;o for a war|ning to you: for not long &s;ince, I heard you &s;ay, that you yet haue many old gee&s;e for proui&s;ion for your kitchin, who&s;e cages you are to looke well to, le&s;t this <HI>Leopard</HI> with craftie baytes and force comes not &s;uddenly and deuoureth them, as he hath already deuoured many <HI>Lions</HI> and <HI>Monkeys,</HI> and the &s;ame would hee doe vnto your owne per&s;on al&s;o, if hee
<PB REF="10">had the meanes according to his will.</P>
<P>I meane this leering &s;uiter, who with a craftie di&s;&s;embling manner of &s;uite, though not openly, &s;eeking to get as neere vn|to you as he can, as you may perceiue by his entry into <HI>Gulicke,</HI> and <HI>Cleaueland,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Marke,</HI> and meaneth not to leaue &s;o, vntill he hath gotten &s;omething that may further his pretence for the warre, not by skirmi&s;hes, thereby to &s;et forth your honour the more (which hee thinketh before this time to haue &s;ufficiently tried) but by long and continuall po|licie in the end to lay hold vpon you by force.</P>
<P>For he accounts you already to bee his owne, although ne|uerthele&s;&s;e (of meere nece&s;&s;ity) hee did acknowledge you to be a free State.</P>
<P>But as he knoweth the nature of diuers &s;laues whom he hath vnder his &s;ubiection, and perceiues well that hee mu&s;t not v&s;e them one like another, to keepe them in bondage, and to get more, he hath therein a &s;peciall watch vpon you, for the <HI>Ango|li&s;h, Sentomi&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Guineian</HI> Moores, were with great cru|elty made his &s;laues, and with &s;eueritie held in bondage. Whereas the <HI>Bra&s;ilian</HI> Nation were by deceit and policy be|reaued of their freedome, and made his, and by compul&s;ion holden &s;laues.</P>
<P>Now marke well Gentlewoman; at the fir&s;t hee &s;ought to you, now he begins to worke otherwi&s;e: in time pa&s;t he began it by cruel <HI>Alua,</HI> whereby he put you into &s;o great a feare, that hee was forced to call backe his executioner for your people were &s;o wilde, that they from him&s;elfe (as the author of the execution) got a di&s;charge of him, &s;o that thereupon came a great <HI>Commander,</HI> with a pardon for your ob&s;tinacie towards him, who mini&s;tred &s;uch Spani&s;h figs (called pardons) that thereby you were almo&s;t choaked in the mier, and many of you died. After him came <HI>Don Iohn de Au&s;tria,</HI> to pacifie you, who at fir&s;t &s;eemed &s;omewhat to encline to a peace, but in &s;hort time after he made an vproare among&s;t you againe. For that cau&s;e there was a &s;trange pre&s;ent &s;ent (but yet for more furtherance to his intent.) which was an Italian <HI>Parma&s;an:</HI> but perceiuing that it was too &s;weet for your ta&s;te, and not liked
<PB REF="11">of, he let the <HI>Parma&s;an</HI> rot, and began to come vpon you with a ha&s;tie <HI>Duch-Earu&s;t:</HI> but becau&s;e your <HI>Batauians</HI> are milde of nature, and can &s;ee farre, hee tooke no plea&s;ure in &s;uch <HI>Erust</HI> proceeding: then hee &s;ent a red &s;hining Spirituall man, that &s;hould make <HI>Albright,</HI> and cleare, thinking to ouercome your per&s;on, and the <HI>Batanian</HI> gouernment with his <HI>Claer Iu|genious</HI> wit and behauiour, which he put in practi&s;e; but all in vaine: after that he came with craftie <HI>Spinners,</HI> (and now with leering <HI>Leopards</HI>) but the <HI>Spinners</HI> webbe was too weake to catch you in: for that cau&s;e he &s;pread another <HI>Nay-d,</HI> or broad net, which hee ca&s;t ouer your head; but it is &s;o loo&s;e and &s;o wide, that you can &s;ee cleerely through it, vnle&s;&s;e that the &s;hew of the no&s;e gay &s;hould make your head &s;o di&s;&s;ie, that by means of the venomous &s;mel thereof, you &s;hould fall a&s;leepe, and that is it which this leering <HI>Leopard</HI> lookes for: to bring you fir&s;t to the <HI>Bra&s;ilian</HI> &s;lauerie, then to deale with you as with the <HI>Guineans;</HI> and la&s;tly, with the <HI>We&s;t-indians.</HI> Therefore pre&s;erue your freedome, and al&s;o &s;hew that you are free; let not others appoint your lawes concerning that which toucheth you, for the pre&s;eruation of your hou&s;e, and the defending of your next neighbours, which concerneth your &s;elfe much, for which this <HI>Leopard</HI> hath long leered (Shipper looke out.)</P>

<P>My good friend, wee are well acquainted in my hou&s;e with the nature and conditions of this <HI>Leopard,</HI> we haue often heard his howling in our garden, but yet we beleeue him not. To that end my many waking eied <HI>Lion</HI> &s;tands before the &s;tile and looks out; and this <HI>Leopard</HI> mu&s;t not thinke that he is in We&s;t-India; for in &s;tead of <HI>Monkeys,</HI> I would &s;end great &s;tore of <HI>Gra&s;hoppers</HI> after him, which are ea&s;ily to bee &s;ound in my gar|den; and I haue ne&s;ts, yea whole regiments of <HI>&s;wift</HI> flies, (<HI>a fig for</HI> the Spani&s;h flies) which ne&s;tle vnder my <HI>Orange tree,</HI> which with their &s;harpe pricking <HI>Augls,</HI> will &s;o pricke and &s;ting him through his &s;peckled skinne, that you &s;hall heare him howle into Spaine, to call for helpe. But my water-fowles (that are very cunning in &s;wimming) would &s;o well watch the coa&s;ts and hauens there, that not one <HI>Leopard</HI> (which are but <HI>Flutte|rer</HI>
<PB REF="11">in the water) &s;hal not dare to thru&s;t their heads out of their holds, for my water-fowles are very &s;harpely &s;et again&s;t the <HI>Leopards,</HI> becau&s;e at other times he hath often taken their egs out of their ne&s;ts, and puld away many of their feathers, and hath cut many of them &s;hort, &s;omtimes when they were wont with great danger to &s;wimme ouer the Spani&s;h &s;eas, into the Spani&s;h hauens, which they yet remember well, and can better reuenge them&s;elues then the <HI>Monkeys.</HI> For fir&s;t my <HI>Gra&s;hoppers</HI> for the mo&s;t part of them, are old <HI>Leapers,</HI> that haue good skill to leape vpon the water-&s;ides, and the hard land, as they in times pa&s;t did vpon Turenholt <HI>Heath,</HI> and Newport &s;ea|&s;trand: but &s;ince that time they haue brought forth many young ones, who are well learned and in&s;tructed by the old ones, and can match the flies well enough, who al&s;o are old and well experienced; for they were wont in times pa&s;t, lu&s;tily to flie vpon the Canary, and S. <HI>Thomas</HI> Suger; and al&s;o vpon the figs and rea&s;ons of <HI>Calis malis,</HI> which was good meate for them; but my water-fowles are &s;o &s;wift in flying, that their nimblene&s;&s;e is known in Ea&s;t-India, where they at other times haue lu&s;tily flowne vpon their Nutmeg blo&s;&s;omes, and there left the &s;mell and &s;auour of the Netherlands <HI>Mateliue,</HI> whereat they did not greatly reioyce; yea they are &s;o quicke and &s;trong in flight, that they flie vp through &s;trange water and waies to <HI>Heem&s;che-kercke,</HI> there to hold the <HI>Iubile,</HI> and they bite &s;o &s;ore, that there is no Spani&s;h <HI>Nut</HI> but they will bite it in peeces, how hard &s;oeuer it be. In &s;wimming al&s;o they are very craftie, and &s;tout, &s;pecially vpon a Spani&s;h fleeet, to bee ma&s;ters of it with a &s;mall power, whereby in Spaine they are called water-Diuels, (without once remembring that God is their Pilot) And though this <HI>Leopard</HI> is a great enemie to the <HI>Lions,</HI> wher|of he hath deceiued and taken many, yet he hath not found the meanes to be guile them all, as it appeareth; for in my <HI>Batauian</HI> hou&s;e, there &s;tandeth or &s;itteth yet &s;euen that lookes out at the window:</P>
<P N="1">1 Fir&s;t, my <HI>Hollands</HI> rampant <HI>Lion:</HI></P>
<L>Who although he doth neere leaue climing &s;till,</L>

<L>Who al&s;o hath a head and liues thereby,</L>
<L>And for the <HI>Libard</HI> careth not a flie.</L>
<P>For although he hath &s;wome long time, he is not yet drow|ned, if occa&s;ion once &s;erued he would make the <HI>Leopard</HI> dance vpon the water, but it &s;hould be no api&s;h dance.</P>
<P N="3">3 In a higher window there &s;tands a <HI>Gelders</HI> Lion.</P>
<L>This holds a place iu&s;t in the <HI>Libards</HI> way,</L>

<P N="4">4 In the window beneath him there are two <HI>Free&s;eland</HI> Li|ons readie to run;</P>
<L>Not for to run away out of his &s;ight,</L>

<L>Doth watch, and hath the <HI>Libard</HI> &s;till in &s;ight.</L>
<P>And in the vpper part of my hou&s;e:</P>
<L>Th'Ea&s;t <HI>Frie&s;land</HI> quicke &s;ight Eagle lookes about,</L>
<L>With's wings abroad to &s;ee how things fall out.</L>
<P>And how high &s;oeuer hee &s;eemes to &s;it, yet if the <HI>Leopard</HI> begins once to play his part, he would &s;oon fle vpon his back: for it is mo&s;t certaine, that all of them together, and euery one of them particularly is well acquainted with the blood-thir|&s;tine&s;&s;e, cruelty, and craftine&s;&s;e of the <HI>Leopard;</HI> and haue a re|gard to what end he comes thus leering hereabout, euery one of them thinking that he leereth vpon him; and therefore they all &s;tand vpon their guard, and would rather willingly leape vpon him, then &s;uffer him to lay hold on them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am of the &s;ame opinion al&s;o, Gentlewoman, and I thinke
<PB REF="12">that all your foure men, whom you tearme your tru&s;tie hu&s;|band men, before you &s;hould bee throwne downe, would ra|ther for a time leaue their tilling the land, &s;eafaring and mer|chandi&s;ing, and &s;et their wiues on worke for the vpholding of your per&s;on, and they them&s;elues with the Souldiers, (whom they would &s;oone rai&s;e out of their &s;leep) would march again&s;t the <HI>Leopard,</HI> for the defence of your <HI>Batauian</HI> gouernment, and the keeping of the Hollands garden: yea, &amp; before that you for want of meanes, or by re&s;traint &s;hould be forced to leaue your &s;eat of freedome, your Commons would rather labor for you, till they &s;weat blood, and yet too great toles and heauie bur|thens are cumber&s;ome to labouring men; but the loue they beare to you, and the hope they haue of their happine&s;&s;e by your freedome, would make them forget the paines they take, for the furtherance of the Common-wealth: but the Husband|men, Sea-faring men, and Citizens, altogether with one con|&s;ent, (to bring their purpo&s;e the better to effect,) wi&s;h that the Souldier al&s;o were awake with them. For a common but then &s;eems a common ea&s;e, but an a&s;&s;ured common re&s;t &amp; quietnes is better, although your men apply them&s;elues to the time. For which cau&s;e, willing labourers that are tied together in the bands of vnity, de&s;erue &s;ome furtherance, and for that you are all their naturall mother, it learnes euery one both great and &s;mall, together and apart, to &s;hew their good wils and duties vnto you in that re&s;pect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Batauia.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true, for my State is co&s;tly to beare all the charges that are nece&s;&s;arily to be laid out, &s;pecially now I am &s;et againe in my free Seate; therefore I would, if I could, bring it &s;o to pa&s;&s;e, that no man &s;hould haue any cau&s;e to finde fault, thereby to make all man free in our garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it is requi&s;ite and very needfull to haue a good regard that the <HI>Leopard</HI> makes no double holes for the <HI>Lion,</HI> that you need not &s;tand in doubt at what hole to watch for him, and al|&s;o to looke well to that double face, and to haue an eye to the troupe of men that &s;tands yonder, for it &s;eemeth that they are
<PB REF="13">at a &s;tand, and would bee gone away: but me thinkes rather that they encrea&s;e and &s;eeme to come neerer; and in the meane time this forepart giueth you a faire &s;miling countenance, and the hinder part is for their furtherance; and therefore a farre off they a&s;&s;emble &s;peedily and hold together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Batauia.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therfore we will commend the watch to our chiefe watch|man <HI>Emanuel,</HI> and commit the charge of our hou&s;e to him, and altogether from henceforth will be vigilant, and looke well to the craftie fetches of the <HI>Leopard;</HI> for if I were &s;ure that hee would leeringly come too neere mee, and that his face would turne about, I would pre&s;ently let my <HI>Lion</HI> loo&s;e to flie vpon the <HI>Leopard,</HI> and wake my Souldier, to beard that mar&s;hall face, who thinketh that he that &s;lumbreth is fa&s;t a&s;leepe, but the noi&s;e would &s;oone awake him.</P>
