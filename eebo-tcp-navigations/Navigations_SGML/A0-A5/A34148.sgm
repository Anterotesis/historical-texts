<HEAD><HI>The Three following Memorials were pre|&s;ented to His Maje&s;ty in</HI> May 1699. <HI>by the Lord Pre&s;ident of the Se&s;&s;ion, and Lord Advocat, on behalf of the Company of</HI> Scotland, <HI>Trading to</HI> Africa <HI>and the</HI> Indies, <HI>a&s;&s;erting the Legality of their Settlement in</HI> Darien.</HEAD>

<HEAD>1&s;t. <HI>MEMORIAL.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Company of <HI>Scot|land,</HI> Trading to <HI>Africa</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> was fir&s;t prepared by an Act of Parliament 1693. In|viting and Encouraging Per&s;ons in General, to enter into Societies, and Companies, for carry|ing on a Trade to what&s;oever Kingdoms, Coun|trie or parts of the World, not being in War with His Maje&s;ty, and thereafter perfected by the Act of Parliament 1695, and a Charter thereon under the Great Seal, whereby the &s;aid Company was fully Settled with all the Powers, Priviledges, and Immunities in u&s;e to be granted in &s;uch ca&s;es, and particularly with Power to plant Colonies, and build Cities, Towns, and Forts in <HI>A&s;ia, Africa,</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> upon Places not Inhabited, or upon any other Place, by Con&s;ent of the Natives, and Inhabitants thereof, and not po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by any <HI>European</HI> Prince or State.</P>
<P>The Settling of this Company was &s;o accept|able to the whole Kingdom, abounding always with Men, and of late Years, very de&s;irous to enlarge Trade and Commerce, That the Com|pany's
<PB N="2" REF="3">Books being once opened, Sub&s;criptions for a va&s;t Sum were compleated long before the Day prefix'd by the Act of Parliament, and there were few Per&s;ons or Families of any Account within the Kingdom, who were not therein par|ticularly concerned.</P>
<P>But tho' the Sub&s;criptions were &s;oon compleat|ed, and the Advances made, as readily as pro|pos'd; yet the Directors and Managers, did proceed with great Deliberation, not being more Cautious to Conceal the Place where they were de&s;ign'd for, than Careful to make &s;uch a Choice, as might be exactly in the Terms of their Act and Patent, To wit, <HI>Either not Inhabited, or freely Con&s;ented to, by the Natives, and not po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by any</HI> European <HI>Prince or State, and &s;o lyable to no Exception.</HI></P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of the&s;e Re&s;olutions, The Com|pany prepared Men, and Provi&s;ions, and &s;et out their Ships, and in the Month of <HI>November</HI> 1698, arrived on the Noth-&s;ide of the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> they pitched upon a Place never be|fore po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> and after formal and di&s;tinct Treaties, obtained the Con&s;ent and Good-will of all the Neighbouring Natives and People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>French</HI> rai&s;e a Clamour a|gain&s;t the Settlement, as an Inva&s;ion of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and Dominions, in as much as the Place where the Company hath fixed, lyes as it were in the Middle and Bo&s;om of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Countries, having <HI>Carthagenae</HI> on the Ea&s;t, and <HI>Porto-Bello</HI> on the We&s;t, and <HI>Panama</HI> on the South, which is al&s;o alledged to be contrary to the
<PB N="3" REF="3">Treaties betwixt the King of <HI>Great Brittain</HI> and the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> whereby all the&s;e Countrie's are yeilded and conformed to the <HI>Spaniards</HI></P>
<P>If the&s;e parts of <HI>America</HI> had been wholly Void and Uninhabited, when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made their fir&s;t Di&s;coveries, and Plantations there, the Que&s;tion had certainly proceeded upon the head of Occupation, the only Ground acknowledg'd by all Lawyers to determine the Property of all Wa&s;te and Uninhabited Countries, where a formal Divi&s;ion hath not Interveened, as <HI>Grotius</HI> in particular, in his Second Book <HI>de jure Belli</HI> doth abundantly clear, and then the <HI>Spaniards</HI> mu&s;t have further Sub&s;umed, That as they found the&s;e Countries Wa&s;te, &s;o they were the Occu|piers and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors thereof; and in Special, that they were the fir&s;t Occupiers and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> and the Place where the Company hath Settled, it being mo&s;t certain, that Occupation gives no Right, &s;ave in &s;o far as the Real and Actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion extends.</P>
<P>But &s;eing on the other hand, it is Nottour, and by all Acknowledg'd, That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did not find the&s;e Parts Wa&s;te, and Uninhabited, this Argument mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arly fall; and all that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> can now Plead, is either pre&s;ent Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, which the Company's Patent owns to be a &s;ufficient Right to any <HI>European</HI> Prince or State, or the above-mention'd Treaties, as exclu&s;ive of the King of <HI>Great Brittain's</HI> Subjects.</P>
<P>For clearing then the Claim and Point of Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, The Company denies that ever the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had any Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Place where they have Planted; and its obviou&s;ly Incumbent
<PB N="4" REF="4">to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> if they alledge Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to prove and in&s;truct their Alledgance for the Com|pany's Argument being Negative, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did never Po&s;&s;e&s;s the Country where the Company hath Settled, it Undeniably proves it &s;elf, as all Lawiers affirm, unle&s;s the contrary, to wit, The <HI>Spaniards</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, be evidently made out and proved, which is impo&s;&s;ible; Nor do the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pretend to prove the &s;ame; But their Alledgance is, That in the&s;e large Coun|tries of <HI>America,</HI> it were plainly Capricious to re|quire the Actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every particular Place; But &s;ince they have the Uncontraverted Right and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Carthagena, Porto-Bello,</HI> and <HI>Panama,</HI> which are the Extremities that in a manner environ the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e Places, mu&s;t infer a Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Interjacent Country in which the Com|pany hath Settled, and con&s;equently, that the Company hath Encroached upon, and Invaded their Right: And further, its &s;aid, That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have actually po&s;&s;e&s;s'd Gold and Silver Mines in <HI>Darien,</HI> much nearer to the Company's Settlement than <HI>Carthgena,</HI> or the&s;e other Places, and have con&s;tantly been in u&s;e to Seize and make Prize of all Ships coming upon the Coa&s;t, be|twixt <HI>Porto-Bello</HI> and <HI>Carthagena,</HI> as Invaders of their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, tho' the&s;e Ships did really pertain to Friends and Allies:</P>
<P>To all which, It is an&s;wered, 1mo. That the above-mentioned Places belonging to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> are very far di&s;tant from the Settlement of the Company, <HI>Carthagena</HI> above Fifty, and <HI>Porto-bello</HI> and <HI>Panama</HI> above Thirty Leagues, which Di|&s;tances are more then &s;ufficient to render Coun|tries
<PB N="5" REF="4">di&s;tinct, both as to Right and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. 2do. It's certain, that <HI>Carthagena, Porto-bello</HI> or <HI>Panama,</HI> cannot be under&s;tood to have unlimited Territories; if then their Territories be limited, it belongs to the makers of the Objection to &s;how, that the Limits of the&s;e places do reach to, and comprehend the Place po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the Company, which neither the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> nor any for them, will ever be able to prove, by the Law of Na|tions, or any known Rule, or Cu&s;tom in &s;uch Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>It hath already been Notic'd, That tho' the&s;e Countries had been wholly Void, when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> begun to Plant there, they could only by their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion have appropriat as far as they did po&s;&s;e&s;s, and that what was not po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, would have remain'd free, to be appropriated by the Occupation, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any other People, a Rule Uncontraverted among&s;t all Na|tions on the Face of the Earth.</P>
<P>But the Ca&s;e of <HI>America</HI> being, That before any Plantations were Settled there, by the <HI>Spani|ards,</HI> the Natives were undoubtedly the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors and Proprietors. It follows nece&s;&s;arly, That Colonies coming to Settle among them, mu&s;t derive Right from them, and that either by Con|&s;ent, Surrender, or Conque&s;t, it being impo&s;|&s;ible in the ca&s;e of Countries inhabited, there can be any other Manner or Mean of Acqui&s;ition; But &s;o it is, That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> acquiring after this manner, neither could, nor can pretend to have Right to more than did pertain to the Peo|ple where they Settled, whether by Con&s;ent, Surrender or Conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Whence it nece&s;&s;arly follows, That &s;ince <HI>Darien</HI> was a di&s;tinct Country, and the Inhabitants
<PB N="6" REF="5">thereof a di&s;tinct People, from tho&s;e Countries and Nations, where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have hitherto Settled whether by Con&s;ent, Surrender, or Conque&s;t; The <HI>Spaniards</HI> cannot pretend to extend their Right beyond that of their Predece&s;&s;ors, and the People &amp; Country of <HI>Darien</HI> mu&s;t &s;till be as free from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> as they were from their Predece&s;&s;ors; and con&s;equently, that the Company coming to po&s;&s;e&s;s with the <HI>Dariens</HI> Con&s;ent, and by their Right, mu&s;t be in the like Condition, and no|ways lyable to either the Claim, or Complaint of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> That the Country and Natives of <HI>Darien</HI> did never &s;ubmit to, or were conquered by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> mu&s;t &s;tand as a &s;ure Po&s;ition, unle&s;s the contrary be proven: But further, it is al&s;o certain, That the <HI>Dariens</HI> were never Repute to have any Dependency even on the great Em|pires of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> much le&s;s upon the lit|tle places of <HI>Carthagena, Porto-bello,</HI> or <HI>Panama:</HI> Be&s;ides, The <HI>Dariens</HI> have been in frequent War with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> &s;ince their fir&s;t arrival into the&s;e Parts, and were never to this day Conquer|ed: All which being atte&s;ted by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and other Travellers, who have Written on this Subject; It appears to be beyond Controver&s;y, That the Company having Settled with the Con|&s;ent of the&s;e <HI>Dariens,</HI> mu&s;t have the &s;ame Right, with the &s;ame Priviledges and Freedom of Trade which the <HI>Dariens</HI> had, and that both are equally free from all the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>It is a known Ca&s;e that an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man one <HI>Sharp,</HI> having join'd with the <HI>Dariens</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> invaded their Territories; he was ac|cu&s;ed by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> as guilty of
<PB N="7" REF="5">Robbery and Piracy, but was acquitted, becau&s;e he acted by Commi&s;&s;ion from one of the <HI>Darien</HI> Princes, which is an undeniable Evidence, that this Prince and his Countrey were judged to be independent on the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> may al&s;o have wrought Mines of Gold and Silver within the I&s;thmus; but no &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion can &s;upport their Complaint: The neare&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mines that they can pretend was in Captain <HI>Diego</HI>'s Country, on the Gulf of <HI>Darien,</HI> more than 15 Leagues di&s;tant from the Company's Settlement: Neither did the <HI>Spaniard</HI> get the&s;e Mines by Conque&s;t, or Purcha&s;e, but by a plain &s;tipulate Permi&s;&s;ion from Captain <HI>Diego,</HI> and his people, which changed not the Property; And upon Breach of Conditions, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were quickly ca&s;t out, &s;o that when the Company came to &s;ettle on the I&s;thmus, it was fully cleared of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &amp; all their pretences.</P>
<P><HI>Carthagena, Portobello</HI> and <HI>Panama,</HI> are adjacent to, and do in a manner environ the I&s;thmus of <HI>Darien;</HI> But that this Vicinity gives to the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> no Claim of Right, is evident from many In&s;tances; <HI>Tangier, Cheuta</HI> and <HI>Mamora,</HI> ly in the Bo&s;om of the Empire of <HI>Morocco,</HI> and yet belong to <HI>European</HI> Princes; The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> have Neighbouring Settlements upon the River <HI>Gambo</HI> in <HI>Africk,</HI> and all along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africk</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and other <HI>European</HI> Princes have their Set|tlements intermixed and contiguous, where they Trade with all Freedom, without any mutual Impeachment. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French</HI> have both Plantations upon the I&s;land of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> and the <HI>Dutch</HI> in time of Peace &s;ettled upon <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> and the adjacent Countrey environed on all hands
<PB N="8" REF="6">by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations, and yet no War en|&s;ued, but the <HI>Dutch</HI> continued their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till the Exchange was made for <HI>Suranam.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleets do nece&s;&s;arly pa&s;s betwixt the Cape of <HI>Florida</HI> belonging to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and the <HI>Bahama</HI> I&s;lands, yet the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the &s;aid I&s;lands, and have al&s;o &s;e|veral times &s;ettled at <HI>Port-Royal</HI> in the bottom of the Bay of <HI>Campiechy</HI> in the Gulf of <HI>Mexico,</HI> for cutting of Logwood, and have thence removed and &s;ettled again at their plea&s;ure. The <HI>French</HI> have al&s;o endeavoured to &s;ettle in the Bay of <HI>Mex|ico,</HI> and lately and more clo&s;ely in the <HI>Samblas</HI> I&s;lands on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Darien;</HI> They likewi&s;e &s;ettled a Colony in <HI>Petitguavis</HI> in <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> and in <HI>Guiana</HI> on the Continent, notwith&s;tanding of the Vicinity of the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> The <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> have their Re&s;pective Plantations on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> to which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> pretend Right as well as to the I&s;thmus of <HI>Darien,</HI> &s;uch as the I&s;lands of <HI>Cura|&s;ao,</HI> and <HI>Bowane,</HI> near to <HI>Carthagena</HI> on the Ea&s;t, and <HI>Suranam</HI> and others upon the Continent, and yet never quarrelled. It is granted that the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> in their exce&s;&s;ive Jealou&s;ie, and upon the Pretext that by Treaties, none were to Trade in their Ports or Harbours, &s;uch as <HI>Carthagena,</HI> and <HI>Porto-bello</HI> without their Licence, have &s;eized and made prize of the Ships that they have found upon the Coa&s;t betwixt the &s;aid Places; But fir&s;t, they did this upon pretext of the &s;aid Treaties. Secondly, Injury and Violence make no Right.</P>
<P>And thirdly, it is mo&s;t certain when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have been overcomeand beat off in &s;uch Attempts, and forced to &s;uffer both <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to cut Logwood on that
<PB N="9" REF="6">Coa&s;t, yet the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did never complain of any Violation of Right, as knowing perfectly they had none, as may be &s;een in <HI>Dampier, Wafer,</HI> and other writers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> at fir&s;t endeavoured to amu&s;e the World, with the Popes Gift of the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> and after the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s becoming King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and in the Right of that Crown, claim|ing the Benefit of the Popes Gift of the <HI>Ea&s;t-In|dies,</HI> he a&s;&s;umed the Magnifick Title of <HI>Indiarum Rex:</HI> Yet he was never able to make good his Right, or exclude others by the&s;e empty Names; but in all Competitions the Pretentions of <HI>Spain,</HI> did either re&s;olve in Occupation of what was void or &s;urrendered, or conque&s;t of what was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by Natives; and that Title was never much regarded, either by <HI>Spain, Portugal,</HI> or any other Prince Popi&s;h or Prote&s;tant.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Head which may be pleaded for the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> is, the Treaties that have been be|twixt the Crowns of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI> But <HI>1mo.</HI> Granting that the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> will never di&s;own any Treaty betwixt their King (whom GOD long pre&s;erve and pro&s;per) may be concerned, where are the&s;e Treaties that exclude either the <HI>Scots</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing <HI>Darien?</HI> if not inhabited, or where Inhabited, with con&s;ent of the Inhabitants? If the <HI>Spaniard</HI> propone upon the&s;e Treaties, they mu&s;t produce them. 2do. All to be found in the latter Treaties betwixt the &s;aid Crowns, &s;uch as the Treatie 1667, and the Treatie 1670, which may be under&s;tood to be the only Regulating Treaties in this Mat|ter, is that in the former, The King of <HI>Spain</HI> o|bliges him&s;elf not to mole&s;t the King of <HI>England,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="7">or his Subjects in their Plantations in <HI>America,</HI> the&s;e particulars enumerated not by way of Ex|ception, but becau&s;e &s;ome of them had been con|traverted. And that in the other Treaty 1670, It is agreed in the 7th. Article, That the King of <HI>Great Brittain,</HI> and <HI>His Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors,</HI> &s;hall have, hold, and po&s;&s;e&s;s, with full Right of Em|pire, Property, and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, all Lands, Regions, I&s;les, Colonies, and Lord&s;hips, &s;ituated in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> or any part of <HI>America,</HI> which his &s;aid Maje&s;ty, or his Subjects, did then hold or po&s;&s;e&s;s, So that no contraver&s;ie on any pretence, was thereafter to be moved on that Subject. And in the eight Article, That the Subjects of the &s;aid King &s;hould ab&s;tain from all Commerce, and Na|vigation, in the Ports and Places, having Forts, Ca&s;tles, or Staples for Merchandi&s;e, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by either of them. To wit, That the Subjects of <HI>Great Brittain</HI> &s;hould not Trade, nor Sail to the Ports nor Places, which the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath in the <HI>VVe&s;t-Indies,</HI> nor the Subjects of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> Trade nor Sail to the Places, which the King of <HI>Great Brittain</HI> there po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, without Licence given <HI>hincinde,</HI> in the Terms therein &s;et down. By which it plainly appears, that all a|greed to, was, and is, That the Kings and their Subjects re&s;pectively, &s;hould forbear Injuries, as likewi&s;e to Trade and Navigate without Licence in the Ports, Ca&s;tles, and Staples, to either of them belonging, which can no ways exclude the King of <HI>Great Brittain</HI> and his Subjects from Trading, or making new Plantations in to &s;uch Places in <HI>America,</HI> as either are not inhabited, or where the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath no Right. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> may po&s;itively pretend, that the Treaties provid|ed
<PB N="11" REF="7">to the King of <HI>England,</HI> and his Subjects of cer|tain particular Places, and generally what they then po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> may be con&s;trued an Exception, and import (as it were) an Ac|knowledgement, that the re&s;t of the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> did belong to the Crown of <HI>Spain.</HI> But, 1mo, The Places provided to the King of <HI>England</HI> and his Subjects are only enumerate for the greater Cauti|on and Security, becau&s;e &s;ome of them had been taken from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and thereupon con|traverted. And, 2do, It is evident by the fore&s;aid eight Articles, the Re&s;erve of Trade is equally and mutually provided, and re&s;tricted to the King of <HI>Great Brittain</HI> and the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> their re&s;|pective Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; &s;o that nothing can be eli|cite from the&s;e Treaties, to give the King of <HI>Spain</HI> the Right to the whole <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> excepting the fore&s;aid places po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the King of <HI>England,</HI> nor to ty up the King of <HI>Brittain</HI> and his Sub|jects, from <HI>making new</HI> lawful Acqui&s;itions in the&s;e Parts. <HI>But it is agreed to,</HI> That they &s;hould &s;ecure the one, the other in their re&s;pective Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions; And thus the&s;e Treaties have been al|ways under&s;tood, nor have they hindred the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to enlarge their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> Occa&s;ions, which certainly be|longs as much if not more to the <HI>Scots.</HI></P>

<P>THe Company of <HI>Scotland</HI> Trading to <HI>Africa</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> having by the other Me|morial, endeavoured to clear the Ju&s;tice of their Proceedings, as to their Settling a Plantation in the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of <HI>Darien</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> do further in all Humility Repre&s;ent,</P>

<P N="1">1mo, That there was never any Enterprize of a more National Concern, than the fore&s;aid Plan|tation is to the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Erecting and E&s;tabli&s;hing of the &s;aid Company, was the Unanimous De&s;ire and Satisfaction of the Nation, all Per&s;ons almo&s;t, and Families of any Con&s;ide|ration, did readily &s;ub&s;cribe for, and advance con&s;iderable Sums, for carrying on the De&s;igns of the Company, much above what could have been expected.

<P N="2">2do, It appears from the whole Circum&s;tances of this Affair, That the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation can have no Prejudice, but rather Advantage by the fore|&s;aid Undertaking: For, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> If it &s;hall be profi|table, the Profit evidently redounds to their Fel|low Subjects and good Neighbours. <HI>Secondly,</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have free Acce&s;s, to come in and par|take of the Profit, when they plea&s;e. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Product of the Place is probably like to con|&s;i&s;t neither of Tobacco nor Suggars, the great Commodities of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations, but of &s;uch Goods and Commodities, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> do not afford. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> It is true, That by the Act
<PB N="13" REF="8">of Parliament, and Patent of the Company, all Ships imployed by the Company, are to return to the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> with their Effects: But it is as true, That the &s;aid Act and Patent did bear the Liberty and Priviledge of a Free Port, and Mercat for all Strangers that &s;hall be plea&s;ed to Trade with them, who are not under the fore|&s;aid Obligation, but may come and go with their Return whether they plea&s;e, which cannot but be of Advantage to the whole <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantati|ons, as to a Free Cour&s;e of Trade. <HI>Fifthly,</HI> It is likeways granted, That by the fore&s;aid Act of Parliament, the Ships, Goods and Effects what|&s;oever belonging to the &s;aid Company, are de|clared free of all Cu&s;toms and other Duties, for the &s;pace of 21 Years, but then four of the &s;aid Years are already run, and this &s;mall Encourage|ment was needful to begin &s;o great a Work, where|of probably the Profit can little more than equal the Expen&s;es for all that &s;pace; And be&s;ides, the Duties of Tobacco and Sugar, not of the Growth of the &s;aid Plantation, are excepted, and not di&s;charged: And al&s;o it is evident, That if the Plantation pro&s;per, the fore&s;aid &s;hort Di&s;charge of Cu&s;toms, and other Duties, will be richly compen&s;ed by the great Increa&s;e of Trade, and con&s;equently of His Maje&s;ties Cu&s;toms, that may for thereafter be thence expected. And, <HI>Sixth|ly,</HI> The Company and Plantation cannot rea&s;o|nably threaten any Diminution of His Maje&s;ties Cu&s;toms in <HI>England;</HI> but on the contrary, this Plantation promi&s;ing a new Trade, far different from the Trade of all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations, and offering to all, the Liberty of a Free Port, mu&s;t rather increa&s;e the Trade of <HI>England,</HI> both to the King and Subjects Advantage.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="9">
<P>As for the Objection, That the Company, by the Immunity they have from Cu&s;toms and Du|ties, may Import, and then as freely Export, and &s;o under&s;ell any other Nation, during that Im|munity: Its An&s;wered, That the Company in <HI>England</HI> have almo&s;t the &s;ame Priviledge, &s;ince, if they plea&s;e to Export after their Return from the Plantations, they are allowed to do it freely with a full Draw-back, excepting only 3 or 4 <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3tio, It is with Submi&s;&s;ion Repre&s;ented, That in all Appearance, if the Company of <HI>Scotland</HI> had not &s;eized the fore&s;aid Po&s;t in <HI>Darien,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> had certainly taken it: And now, that it is di&s;covered to be &s;o advantageous for Trade, it is not to be doubted, but that the <HI>French,</HI> who &s;hew &s;uch Earne&s;tne&s;s to have the <HI>Scots</HI> excluded, will certainly, if any &s;uch thing &s;hould happen, po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of it, not only to the Hurt of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations, but to the far greater Prejudice, if not the Ruin of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> In|tere&s;t in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>And therefore, All things truly and ju&s;tly con|&s;idered, it is hoped, that not only the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> will become more and more favourable to &s;o good a De&s;ign, but that even the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> will the more ea&s;ily acquie&s;ce to Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice, that they &s;ee a more Powerful Competitor ready to catch hold of an Advantage, that cannot be &s;o &s;afe for them in the Hands of any other Nation, as in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fore&s;aid Company.</P>

<P>THe Charge is great, and if it can be made appear, that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> is Invaded, as is pretended, it is but Rea&s;on there &s;hould be ju&s;t Reparation.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged, That it is a fair way of dealing, that the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Rights and Pre|ten&s;ions are thus a&s;&s;erted by Memorial, and an Opportunity afforded, and that the whole World may be &s;atisfied, that His Sacred Maje&s;ty, the King of <HI>Great Brittain,</HI> hath granted no Patent to His Subjects in <HI>Scotland</HI> di&s;agreeable to Treaties with <HI>Spain,</HI> and that the <HI>Scots</HI> Company have not exceeded the Limits of their Patent, to the preju|dice of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>There may be many Rea&s;ons offered to &s;ati&s;|fy <HI>Spain,</HI> and all other Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> except the <HI>French,</HI> that if the <HI>Scots</HI> had not &s;ettled in that <HI>Isthmus,</HI> or if they were now to remove from it, the &s;ame would be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by another People, more dangerous to the Intere&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI> and in due time it may be made appear, that the <HI>Scots</HI> Settlement is for the Honour of the King, &amp; the Intere&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> but the pre&s;ent de&s;ign is only to &s;atisfie the World, that the Patent granted by His Maje&s;ty, was agreeable to the Treaty with

<P>It is the Intere&s;t and Policy of all Governments, to improve the Natural Product of a Countrey, and to encourage Forreign Trade.</P>
<P>The Experience of all Nations makes appear, That nothing contributes &s;o effectually to the&s;e ends, as Forreign Plantations.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> is among&s;t the la&s;t of the Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> in &s;ettling Forreign Plantations, tho' there be few that can propo&s;e more Advantage that way, becau&s;e the Nation affords many Sub|jects of Manufacture, and abounds in Men, which is the greate&s;t Riches, as well as the Strength of a Nation; Yet for want of Forreign Plantations, many have been u&s;ele&s;s and burden&s;ome to their Native Countrey, and have been con&s;trained to &s;erve Abroad in Forreign Wars, or into Plantati|ons of other Countreys: And it is to be ob&s;erved, that wherever they have planted, they have en|crea&s;ed and multiplied, as particularly in <HI>Ireland;</HI> but no part of the Benefit does accrue to their Native Countrey.</P>
<P>The Nation has very long de&s;ired Forreign Settlements of their own, and did make &s;ome At|tempts that way, which proved ineffectual for want of due Encouragement, but His Sacred Ma|je&s;ty, as Father of his Countrey, regarding the Welfare of it, did endue the &s;ame with &s;uteable Encouragements by the 32d. <HI>Act, Par.</HI> 1693. and by the 8th. <HI>Act, Par.</HI> 1695. Yet both the&s;e Laws
<PB N="18" REF="11">were granted with a due regard to all former Planters;
<Q REND="margQuotes">And did only allow them to plant Colonies, build Cities, Towns, and Forts in <HI>A&s;ia, Africa,</HI> and <HI>America,</HI> upon Places not in|habited, or in, or upon any other Place, by Con&s;ent of the Natives, or Inhabitants there|of, and not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by any <HI>European</HI> Sove|reign, Potentate, Prince or State.</Q></P>
<P>By the&s;e Acts of Parliament, and Patent con|form, His Maje&s;ty did &s;ufficiently provide, that the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of no <HI>European</HI> Prince &s;hould be in|vaded or mole&s;ted: And if <HI>Spain</HI> be injured, the Company mu&s;t acknowledge, that the Injury flows from them, by exceeding the Limits of their Patent.</P>
<P>It remains to be cleared in behalf of the Com|pany, that they have &s;trictly ob&s;erved the Rules pre&s;crib'd by the &s;aid Acts and Patent.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Title to <HI>America</HI> by the Pope's Bull, is rejected by the common Con&s;ent of all the Princes and States in <HI>Europe,</HI> who could not have &s;ettled there without Injury to <HI>Spain,</HI> if the Pope's Bull had been a &s;ufficient Title; and neither <HI>Spain</HI> or <HI>Portugal</HI> hath relyed upon that Title, the one having planted in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and the other in the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> without regard to it: And this Title is &s;ufficiently di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by <HI>Grotius</HI> in his <HI>Mare Liberum, Cap.</HI> 3. and will never be in|&s;i&s;ted on any where, and lea&s;t of all in <HI>Brittain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>America</HI> being inhabited by Natives, before <HI>Spain</HI> or any <HI>European</HI> People &s;ettled there, it is mo&s;t certain, that the Right and Property did o|riginally belong to the&s;e Natives, becau&s;e the Earth was created for, and freely given by the Creator to the Children of Men, and the mo&s;t Ancient and Uncontraverted Right of Property
<PB N="19" REF="11">of the Earth is by Occupation and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which is an outward Act of the Body <HI>qua&s;i po&s;itio pedis,</HI> and not an inward Act of the Mind, which cannot be known to others, be&s;ide many Mens wills might concur in wi&s;hing and liking the &s;ame thing, but their Bodies cannot concur in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing it, and an outward Act of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion warns others to ab&s;tain.</P>
<P>The Property that originally belonged to the Natives, could only be transferred from them to <HI>Spain</HI> by Conque&s;t or Con&s;ent, and <HI>Spain</HI> can pre|tend neither of the&s;e Titles to the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> where the <HI>Scots</HI> have &s;ettled.</P>
<P>It is alledg'd for <HI>Spain,</HI> That they do po&s;&s;e&s;s the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> in as far as they are undoubt|ed Ma&s;ters of the Bay of <HI>Panama,</HI> and the whole Coa&s;t of the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> upon the South Sea: They have likewi&s;e <HI>Carthagena</HI> and <HI>Portobella</HI> on the North Sea, and they are Ma&s;ters of the whole Countrey betwixt <HI>Carthagena</HI> and <HI>Portobello,</HI> and &s;o mu&s;t be reckoned Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of all, becau&s;e Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion doth not require the particular Occupation of every part of a Countrey, but Occupation of one part is a &s;ufficient Act to demon&s;trate the Will and In|tention to po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole Pertinents: And the <HI>Spaniards</HI> having po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the&s;e two Extremes, the middle Space belongs to them, e&s;pecially &s;eing they have al&s;o &s;ettled in other Places betwixt the&s;e two, as their Conveniency did require, tho' they did afterwards quite the&s;e Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as particularly they once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>Nombre de Diot,</HI> and did al&s;o plant within the River <HI>Datien,</HI> and tho' they did quite the&s;e Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, they did not relinqui&s;h or repudiate their Right, but being better informed, they choo&s;ed more convenient Seats, but &s;till reckoned them&s;elves Proprietors of

<P>They further add, That <HI>Spain</HI> hath been con&s;i|dered as undoubted Proprietors of the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and of that <HI>I&s;thmus,</HI> by other Nations in Chri&s;tendom, and mo&s;t particularly by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as is well known, and will clearly appear in two remarkable In&s;tances.</P>
<P>Several <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants having advanc'd their Stock, for &s;ettling a Plantation at <HI>Port-Royal</HI> in the Bottom of the Bay of <HI>Campechay,</HI> for cutting of Logwood, they de&s;ired the Countenance and Pro|tection of the Government, for carrying on this profitable Trade: The Ca&s;e was con&s;idered by the Council of <HI>England,</HI> and it was not found ju&s;t, to allow the Protection of the Government, but were only left in a Permi&s;&s;ive State, to manage their Trade upon their Peril.</P>
<P>The Second Ca&s;e, which comes clo&s;er to the pre&s;ent Que&s;tion, was a Propo&s;al by certain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Undertakers to &s;ettle in <HI>Darien,</HI> as the <HI>Scots</HI> have done, which being brought to the Council of Trade of <HI>England,</HI> and by them laid before the Lords Ju&s;tices in His Maje&s;ties Ab&s;ence, and tran&s;|mitted to the King him&s;elf, Upon a full Con&s;i|deration of the Ca&s;e, that Project was thought to be an Encroachment upon <HI>Spain,</HI> and let fall.</P>
<P>The King him&s;elf, and Council of <HI>England,</HI> be|ing &s;atisfied of the Right of <HI>Spain,</HI> in the&s;e par|ticular Ca&s;es of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Undertakers, the &s;ame judgment ought to follow, in relation to the Sco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> Company.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="12">
<P>To all that is alledged, it's &s;hortly and clearly An&s;wered, That <HI>Spain</HI> hath neither Right by Treaties nor Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to the Countrey now po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>Scots:</HI> And, 1&s;t. Tho' it be acknow|ledg'd, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have more Strength, and larger Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on the South, than upon the North Sea, yet no Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion there can be exten|ded to the North-&s;ide of the <HI>I&s;thmus,</HI> being po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd by a People Independent, who never re|ceived the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or became &s;ubject to them: The <HI>Spaniards</HI> indeed have made great Settlements upon the South Sea, and in &s;o far as they have po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, have re&s;tricted the Natives to narrower Bounds; but the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;till continuing to po&s;&s;e&s;s what remains, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion on the Coa&s;t, or the Mouths of Rivers on the South Sea, can never be extended to the North Coa&s;t: And the <HI>Spani|ard</HI> can conde&s;cend upon no Ground in Law or Rea&s;on for &s;uch an Exten&s;ion, hor can they make appear, that what the <HI>Scots</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s is Part and Per|tiennt of their Plantation, e&s;pecially con&s;idering that the <HI>I&s;thmus</HI> of <HI>Darien</HI> is naturally divided by a Ridge of high Hills running from Ea&s;t to We&s;t.</P>
<P>Neither doth the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Carthagena</HI> and <HI>Porto-bello,</HI> give Right to the interveening Coun|trey, which is above 80 Leagues or 240 <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles, and the&s;e particular Forts, as well as the whole <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Plantations on the South Sea, be|ing fixt without con&s;ent of the Natives, who con|tinue their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in the interveening Coun|trey, without any Subjection to, or acknowledg|ment of the <HI>Spaniard:</HI> It lyes upon the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to conde&s;cend by what Rule the Limits of the&s;e Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions can be &s;o far extended.</P>
<P>As to what is alledged, That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have other Plantations nearer to the <HI>Scots</HI> Settle|ment
<PB N="22" REF="13">from which they removed, but &s;till retain Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>It is An&s;wered, Admitting the matter of Fact as alledged, it comes to nothing; For &s;till it is to be remembred, That the <HI>Spaniard</HI> will not pre|tend to have planted with the con&s;ent of the Na|tives: Nor, that the <HI>Darien Indians</HI> have ever ac|knowledg'd Subjection; but they planted by Force and Violence: And therefore, whatever Forts they made in the <HI>Isthmus</HI> of <HI>Darien,</HI> the mo|ment that the&s;e Plantations were left, the Right and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Natives did return.</P>
<P>It is freely acknowledged, That Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion lawfully obtain'd by an outward Act of the Body, is retain'd by Acts of the Mind, if no other po&s;|&s;e&s;s; but when Po&s;&s;e&s;sion is taken by way of Fact, and not actually detained, the Right and Po&s;&s;e&s;sion returns to the lawful Proprietor.</P>
<P N="2">2. This alledged Po&s;&s;e&s;sion of <HI>Nombre de Dios,</HI> and in the <HI>River of Darien,</HI> is only pretended to have been at their fir&s;t Settlement in <HI>America,</HI> be|fore they po&s;&s;e&s;s'd <HI>Carthagena</HI> and <HI>Porto-bello.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. None of the&s;e pretended Settlements are within 20 Leagues of the <HI>Scots</HI> Colony; And tho <HI>Spain</HI> had yet Plantations there, the Limits could as little be extended to 20 Leagues beyond the actual Po&s;&s;e&s;sion as to a Thou&s;and: Nei|ther can the <HI>Spaniards</HI> prove any Act of Juri&s;dicti|on over the <HI>Darien Indians,</HI> whatever Title they may think fit to give to Governours or Vice-Roy's in <HI>America,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> do neither know, nor are oblig'd to notice the &s;ame: If Titles were e|nough, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> a&s;&s;umes a Glorious Title of <HI>Indiarum Rex,</HI> but he has no more Juri&s;diction over the <HI>Darien Indians,</HI> than in the Plantations of any other <HI>European</HI> Prince.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="13">
<P>As to what is alledg'd upon the Opinions given by the King and Council of <HI>England,</HI> in relati|on to His Maje&s;ty's <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects projecting Settlements in <HI>America,</HI> The Circum&s;tances of the Projects, and the Motives of any Re&s;olution taken in them, are wholly unknown to the <HI>Scots,</HI> and nothing can be founded on &s;uch Matters of Fact, unle&s;s the whole Circum&s;tances were Au|thentically in&s;tructed or acknowledg'd, but what|ever was thought proper in the&s;e Ca&s;es, nothing can be inferred from thence to determine this.</P>
<P>A Project is to be regulated either by Law or by Conveniency; And it's very ordinary and &s;ute|able, That his Maje&s;ty and the Government may di&s;courage the Project of an Undertaking, if not Convenient, tho lawful: But when a Pro|ject is Undertaken, Carried on, and a Settlement made in pur&s;uance of expre&s;s Acts of Parliament, and conform to a Patent, there's no more place to Deliberate what is fit, but what is Lawful.</P>
<P>If the whole Circum&s;tances were known, many Di&s;parities might al&s;o appear, and from the bare relation of the Ca&s;e of the intended Settlement in the Bay of <HI>Campeohay</HI> a manife&s;t Di&s;parity is evident.</P>
<P>The Bay of <HI>Campechay</HI> is in the Province of <HI>Nicaragua,</HI> in the Dioce&s;s of <HI>Chiapo,</HI> which Pro|vince and Bi&s;hoprick, are part of the Ancient <HI>Empire</HI> of <HI>Mexico,</HI> which was conquered by <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>By the Conque&s;t of <HI>Mexico,</HI> the King of <HI>Spain</HI> as Conquerour, had Right of Sovereignty as far as the Dominions of <HI>Mexico</HI> did extend, and the Right and Po&s;&s;e&s;sion of the Conquered People may rea&s;onably be reckoned to become the Po&s;|&s;e&s;sion of the Conquerour; And therefore a Settle|ment in <HI>Nicaragua</HI> or Bay of <HI>Campechay</HI> might be
<PB N="24" REF="14">reckoned a down Right Encroachment upon <HI>Spain,</HI> which cannot be drawn in Con&s;equence to a Settlement upon <HI>Darien,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Spaniards</HI> can conde&s;cend upon no Title or Right beyond their actual Po&s;&s;e&s;sion; for the <HI>Dariens</HI> were ne|ver &s;ubdued, nor did they ever depend upon <HI>Mexico</HI> or <HI>Peru,</HI> or any Prince or People &s;ubdued by the <HI>Spanirds.</HI></P>
<P>And further, whatever be urged from the&s;e Ca&s;es, yet it can be made appear, That the Un|dertaking to &s;ettle in <HI>Campechay</HI> was effectual, and the Cart is marked <HI>Port-Royal Engli&s;h-Colony;</HI> and 'tis known that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> cutt Logwood at <HI>Cape-Catach</HI> in <HI>Jucatan</HI> till the Charge of Carriage ren|der'd it unprofitable, and thereafter Settled at <HI>Port-Royal</HI> for the &s;ame Effect, where there is plenty of Logwood appropriated to the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>It is al&s;o acknowledg'd, That the <HI>Darien-Indians</HI> are no powerful People, or able by them&s;elves to re&s;i&s;t the Impre&s;sions of <HI>Spain,</HI> but the point of Right and Property is the &s;ame in Rich and Poor, Strong and Weak, and they might lawfully transfer their Right, and a&s;&s;ume the <HI>Scots</HI> or any other Nation to &s;upport or maintain the Right and Po&s;&s;e&s;sion of that <HI>Isthmus,</HI> in as far as it was free from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions.</P>
<P>Yet the <HI>Dariens</HI> were not wholly neglected by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> as incon&s;iderable, for there have been frequent and almo&s;t con&s;tant Wars between them and <HI>Spain,</HI> in which the &s;everal Captains and <HI>Carriques</HI> have joyned together, and there is a fa|mous Ca&s;e of <HI>Barth: Sharp,</HI> who being accu&s;ed in <HI>England</HI> as guilty of Piracy and Robbery commit|ted upon the <HI>Indians,</HI> he defended him&s;elf as acting by Commi&s;sion from Independent Native <HI>Indians</HI> then at War with <HI>Spain,</HI> and was acquitted.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="14">
<P>The Right of the <HI>Scots</HI> Colony, as flowing from the Native <HI>Indians,</HI> is already &s;ufficiently cleared, according to the mo&s;t Ancient and Authentick Laws of Property, acknowledg'd by all Nations: And for a further Evidence and Demon&s;tration of what has been a&s;&s;erted, and already &s;ufficient-proven the Settlement of the <HI>Engli&s;h, French, Danes, Portugue&s;es,</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> will all be found to be Bottomed on the &s;ame Ground.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> are the mo&s;t Ancient Planters, and if <HI>Spain</HI> pretend to any Univer&s;al Title, either by Occupation of a part, or by the Popes Gift, or any other Right, he thereby excludes the Claim of all Po&s;terior Planters, either in the Continent, or <HI>American</HI> I&s;lands, which could not be thought to be &s;eparate and indifferent Domi|nions: And if <HI>Spain</HI> recede from any Univer&s;al Title to the whole, it will not be po&s;sible to ex|tend his Claim beyond his proper Po&s;&s;e&s;sion, or the Po&s;&s;e&s;sions of the&s;e that are Subduced and Conquered by <HI>Spain:</HI> And if this be called in Que&s;tion, it is expected, That &s;ome other Title will be conde&s;cended upon, that may clear the Limits and Extent of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Colonies, &s;o as to make a Difference betwixt the <HI>Scots</HI> Settlement in <HI>Darien,</HI> and the Settlement of other Princes in the <HI>American</HI> I&s;lands or Continent.</P>
<P>The Empires of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru</HI> are known, and may be yielded to <HI>Spain,</HI> but the remainder of that va&s;t Countrey was anciently po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by little Princes, or rather Captains or Heads of Fa|milies or Cariques, who have no Dependance up|on each other, nor upon any Prince or Potentate, but by Leagues and Agreement for mutual De|fence. Thus it is known, That the Land of the <HI>Amazons</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the Natives; And it is
<PB N="26" REF="15">remarkable, That upon the Banks of <HI>Amazon,</HI> there are Fifty different Nations: So it is in <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> in <HI>Chili, Paragua, Florida, Carolina, Virginia,</HI> and generally over all the Continent, as well as in the I&s;lands of <HI>America,</HI> and likewi&s;e in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Africa:</HI> And therefore, <HI>European</HI> Princes have planted promi&s;cuou&s;ly, as they found Convenien|cy, without Injury or Encroachment upon for|mer Planters.</P>

<P>The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Plate-Fleet do nece&s;&s;arly pa&s;s be|twixt <HI>Cape-Florida</HI> and the <HI>Bahaman-I&s;lands,</HI> yet the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e I&s;lands, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> did mightily re&s;ent, and u&s;ed the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> very bar|barou&s;ly upon it, yet <HI>Spain</HI> not being able to ju&s;ti|fy any unlawful Title, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> did maintain their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Whatever be alledg'd, That the Government did not interpo&s;e for e&s;tabli&s;hing a Logwood-Trade, yet it's certain, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> did ap|propriate the Logwood at <HI>Cape-Catch</HI> in <HI>Jucatan,</HI> till it was exhau&s;ted, and they afterwards &s;ettled at <HI>Port-Royal</HI> in the Bay of <HI>Campechay,</HI> for carrying on the &s;ame Trade, which was never que&s;tion'd by the <HI>Spaniards.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> have &s;everal times endeavoured to &s;ettle in the River <HI>de Spiritu Sancto</HI> in the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and al&s;o the <HI>Samballo-I&s;lands</HI> upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Darien,</HI> and have actually &s;ettled a Colony in

<P>The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> have the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il</HI> divided into many Captain&s;hips. The Intere&s;t of <HI>Spain</HI> was ever oppo&s;it to all the&s;e Settlements in <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> and wherever they were &s;trong enough, they attempted to expel the Planters, without regard to Peace or War, whereof the <HI>Scots</HI> did formerly feel the Effects, in their Plantation at <HI>Carolina</HI> hol|den of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> from whence they were expelled: The&s;e things were done by way of Fact, but it is the fir&s;t time that ever <HI>Spain</HI> did openly pretend a Right beyond actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which was never &s;u&s;tained by any <HI>European</HI> Prince. And it is de&s;ired and expected, that there may be a further Conde&s;cendance of the Right and Title of <HI>Spain,</HI> to exclude other Planters by the Con&s;ent of the Natives, where <HI>Spain</HI> hath no actual Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, or Exerci&s;e of any Juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>It is further alledged for <HI>Spain,</HI> That all the Bu|&s;ine&s;s in <HI>America</HI> was &s;ettled by the Pacification 1670, betwixt the Kings of <HI>Brittain</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> which did confirm all the Plantations po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colonies, and left the Remainder of <HI>Ame|rica</HI> to <HI>Spain,</HI> and whatever happened before that General Treaty, could be no Rule thereafter, be|cau&s;e there was almo&s;t perpetual War with <HI>Spain</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> which were never &s;ettled or compo&s;ed till the Treaty 1670, which did pre&s;uppo&s;e and e&s;ta|bli&s;h
<PB N="28" REF="16">the Right of <HI>Spain</HI> to all that was not po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed by the King of <HI>Brittain</HI>'s Subjects.</P>
<P>As to the In&s;tance of <HI>Sharp,</HI> it is not denyed that he was acquitted, and among&s;t others did propone that Defence, That he Acted by Commi&s;&s;ion from an <HI>Indian</HI> Prince; but that Defence was look'd up|on as a Je&s;t, and it was not for that Rea&s;on that he was acquitted.</P>
<P>It is An&s;wered, There was indeed a Treaty in the Year 1670, concerning <HI>America</HI> in particular, whereby it was provided, <Q REND="margQuotes">That the King of <HI>Brittain</HI> &s;hould have, hold and enjoy for ever, with full Right of Sovereignty, Dominion and Property, all tho&s;e Lands, Regions, I&s;lands, Colonies, and Places what&s;oever &s;ituated in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> or any part of <HI>America,</HI> which the &s;aid King and his Subjects did then hold and po&s;&s;e&s;s;</Q> From which Article the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would infer, that all the re&s;t of <HI>America</HI> was lo&s;t by the King of <HI>Brittain,</HI> as a Right and Dominion of <HI>Spain,</HI> becau&s;e that <HI>Spain</HI> ratifies the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion ob|tained by the King of <HI>Brittain,</HI> and there is not a mutual Ratification of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>This Article can bear no &s;uch Inference, for,</P>
<P N="1">1. The King of <HI>Brittain</HI> and his Subjects did not then, nor do they now in the lea&s;t que&s;tion the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> and his Subjects, but the King of <HI>Spain</HI> did very much que&s;tion the Right of the King of <HI>Brittain</HI> to &s;everal of his <HI>Ame|rican</HI> Plantations, not only upon the general Ground of an Univer&s;al Title to all the <HI>We&s;t-In|dies,</HI> which no <HI>European</HI> Prince will bear, but like|wi&s;e upon particular Claims, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had beat out the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and enjoyed what had been once po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by them in &s;everal places: And the
<PB N="29" REF="16">former Treaties with <HI>Spain</HI> e&s;pecialy that in the Year 1667, were only general, e&s;tabli&s;hing a perpe|tual Peace betwixt the Dominions and Terito|ries of <HI>Brittain</HI> and the&s;e of <HI>Spain:</HI> But the Que|&s;tion remaining anent the Right and Dominion of the&s;e <HI>American</HI> Settlements to which the King of <HI>Spain</HI> did lay &s;till a Claim, The Treaty 1670, did renounce his Claim to the Colonies in the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;sion, but did determine nothing as to tho&s;e parts of <HI>America,</HI> which were never Po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>Spaniard</HI> or <HI>Britti&s;h,</HI> and if it had been intended, that the Right of <HI>Spain</HI> to all <HI>America</HI> that was not po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by &s;ome other <HI>European</HI> Prince &s;hould be a&s;&s;erted, and declared the &s;ame would not have been left to &s;uch remote conje|ctures, but would have been &s;pecially expre&s;s'd.</P>
<P N="2">2. The whole Tenor of that Treaty does &s;uf|ficiently clear, that no &s;uch thing was intended as to pre&s;uppo&s;e, much le&s;s to a&s;&s;ert the Right of <HI>Spain</HI> beyond actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. For by the Se|cond Article of the Treaty, it is provided, <Q REND="margQuotes">That there be an Univer&s;al Peace in <HI>America,</HI> as in o|ther parts of the World between the Kings of Great <HI>Brittain</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and between the King|doms, States, Plantations, Colonies, Forts, Cities, I&s;lands and Dominions belonging to either of them; and between the People and Inhabitants under their re&s;pective Obedience.</Q></P>
<P>This Article in the Treaty relating to <HI>America,</HI> only doth clearly demon&s;trate, that both Kings were &s;et upon an equal foot, and did Treat for them&s;elves and the People and Inhabitants under their re&s;pective Obedience, and no further; &s;o that all matters were left untouched that did con|cern parts not Inhabited or po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by Natives, who were never under obedience to either Prince,
<PB N="30" REF="17">nor would the Treaty have been for Plantations, Colonies, Forts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> equally and mutually, if either King had pretended an univer&s;al Title or Right beyond Po&s;&s;e&s;sion.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Eight Article doth yet further clear, that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had no Univer&s;al Claim, but according to his Po&s;&s;e&s;sion, which Article provides, that the Subjects, Inhabitants and Ma|riners of the Dominions of each Confederate, &s;hall forbear to Sail to, or Trade in the Ports and Havens which are fortified with Ca&s;tles, Maga|zines or Ware-Hou&s;es, and in all other. Places what&s;oever, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the other Party in the We&s;t <HI>Indies.</HI> To wit, the Subjects of Brittain &s;hall not Sail into, and Trade in the Havens and Places, which the Catholick King holds in the <HI>Indies,</HI> nor in like manner &s;hall the Subjects of the King of <HI>Spain</HI> Sail into, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This Clau&s;e is, plainly re&s;trictive upon the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> That the Subjects of the King of <HI>Brittain</HI> &s;hall not Trade into the&s;e places of the <HI>Indies</HI> which belong to <HI>Spain;</HI> for thereby it pre&s;uppo&s;es that <HI>Spain</HI> has no Univer&s;al Title, and its left free to the King of <HI>Brittains</HI> Subjects to Sail into, and Trade in all Ports and Havens which have no Fortifications, Ca&s;tles, Magazines, or Ware-Hou&s;es Po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and con|&s;equently it was lawful to have Sailed to, and Traded with the <HI>Darien Indians</HI> where the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had no Fortifications, Ca&s;tles, Magazines or Ware-Hou&s;es, nor can clear any manner of Po&s;&s;e&s;sion, and if they might Trade with the <HI>Indians</HI> it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd they might Settle among them.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">It's al&s;o provided by the Tenth Article, that in ca&s;e the Ships of either Party be forced
<PB N="31" REF="17">by &s;tre&s;s of Weather, or otherwi&s;e into the Ri|vers, Creeks, Bays or Ports belonging to the other in <HI>America,</HI> they &s;hall be treated there with all Humanity and Kindne&s;s;</Q> Which Ar|ticle &s;tates both Kings again upon an equal foot, and mentions the Right of both as re&s;trictive to particular Rivers, Creeks, Bays, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in <HI>America</HI> as if neither Party claimed Univer&s;al Title over all.</P>
<P><Q REND="margQuotes">The 15th. Article of the &s;aid Treaty pro|vides, that the &s;ame &s;hall in nothing derogate from any preheminency, Right or Dominion of any Confederate in the <HI>American</HI> Seas, Chan|nels or Waters, but that they have and retain the &s;ame in as full and ample manner as may of right belong unto them, providing al|ways that the Liberty of Navigation ought in no manner to be di&s;turbed.</Q></P>
<P>This Article relates to certain Preheminencies and Priviledges claim'd by <HI>Spain</HI> in the <HI>American</HI> Sea, which by the Treaty was not yeilded, but left in the &s;ame &s;tate as formerly; and if the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had pretended to an Univer&s;al Right o|ver all <HI>America,</HI> in &s;o far as is not po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by o|ther <HI>European</HI> Princes, why was he more carefull to pre&s;erve his Claim of Sovereignty in the Seas, and forgot his Dominion upon the main Land? There can be no other rea&s;on for it, but becau&s;e there was no &s;uch thing in pro&s;pect, as appears by the whole Tenor of the Treaty.</P>
<P>Nothing hath been alledged in behalf of <HI>Spain</HI> to make any di&s;parity betwixt all the Settle|ments that have been made in <HI>America</HI> by the Sub|jects of the King of <HI>Brittain</HI> or other Princes, ex|cept the Treaty 1670: Which when duly con&s;i|dered, makes no di&s;parity at all. For albeit the
<PB N="32" REF="18">Po&s;&s;e&s;sion of the King of <HI>Brittains</HI> Subjects be there|by confirmed; yet it will not be acknowledg'd by the King of Great <HI>Brittain,</HI> or any other Prince that the Settlements made by their Subjects were illegal or violent, untill confirmed by the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and all Nations who have Planted there mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain and ju&s;tify the <HI>Scots</HI> Settlement, or acknowledge that the Settlement of their own Subjects were injurious to the Right of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>It is not, nor can be denyed, that the <HI>Dariens</HI> have been at frequent War with <HI>Spain,</HI> altho' they pretend, that the <HI>Dariens</HI> were rather Rebels than Enemies. That is only for to beg the Que&s;tion, for the Natives having the Ancient undoubted Right, it mu&s;t be in&s;tructed, that they became Subjects before they could be Rebels.</P>
<P>And tho' it be alledged, that what was done in <HI>Sharp</HI>'s Ca&s;e was reckoned a Je&s;t, and that he was not acquitted upon that ground, as acting by Commi&s;sion from the <HI>Dariens;</HI> yet the matter of Fact is certain and known, and was indeed re|marked by all <HI>England,</HI> that <HI>Sharp</HI> join'd with the <HI>Dariens,</HI> did commit acts of Ho&s;tility and carried away great booty from the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and was pur&s;ued for Re&s;titution in <HI>England,</HI> and did pro|pone a Defence. That he acted by Commi&s;sion from an Independent People, and was acquitted by a competent Judicature in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e matters of Fact being all acknowledged, it mu&s;t be thought that a Deci&s;ion in the way of Ju&s;tice was no Je&s;t, but according to the Law of the Nation.</P>
<P>To Conclude and Sum up the whole Matter, The <HI>Scots</HI> did not move one foot, untill they ob|tain'd two Acts of Parliament, and a Patent in their favours. The&s;e Acts (tho' very ample)
<PB N="33" REF="18">were framed with a ju&s;t regard to former Plan|ters, who by the expre&s;s Tenor of the &s;aid Laws were not to be invaded or mole&s;ted in their Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; even the ju&s;t Right and Property of the Infidel Natives was con&s;idered, and the Under|takers not allowed to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them by Force and Violence, but to Plant with their con&s;ent: Upon the faith of the&s;e Laws, a greater Stock was advanced in <HI>Scotland</HI> than ever was rai&s;ed by any other Nation, upon the fir&s;t project of a Forreign Plantation; the Directors of the Com|pany did very narrowly and exactly con&s;ider all the Treaties with <HI>Spain,</HI> and pitched upon a place, that the whole World con&s;iders to be of a great value for founding and rai&s;ing a profitable Trade to the Honour of the King who (as the Father of the Countrey) did endue them with ample and ju&s;t Priviledges, to the encrea&s;e of the Strength and Riches of the I&s;le of <HI>Brittain,</HI> which is all under the Government of one Monarch, of one Religion and Intere&s;t, and can have no dif|ferent Friends or Enemies without endangering the whole. In one word, The <HI>Scots</HI> Company have acted deliberatly, for advantage to them|&s;elves, the Nation, and the I&s;le of <HI>Brittain;</HI> they have only u&s;ed their own Right and have wronged no Nation or People, nor exceeded the Limits of their Patent in any circum&s;tance. And if any will &s;tand up for the Intere&s;t of <HI>Spain,</HI> and call in que&s;tion the matters of Fact and principles of Law above a&s;&s;erted, which are generally known and need not to be confirmed by particular Citations. they may a&s;&s;uredly expect that what has been affirmed &s;hall be made further clear and evident beyond contradiction, and whatever Ob&s;tacles
<PB N="34" REF="19">or Difficulties have, or may fall in, <HI>Ardua quae Pulchra,</HI> the undertaking was deliberate, ju&s;t for the intere&s;t of the Nation, and with more regard to the Right of former Planters and Natives than any former Project of that Nature.</P>
