<HEAD>A few words of direction to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>I Have not written every place in that order, as is set downe in the Title of this Pamphlet, but of such places as I travelled unto, I have truly related the passages, and the time, both when, where, why, and how I went, came and per|form'd it. If any man aske wherefore this Book is good, or how it may be any way usefull, I answer that it is foure ways com|modious: First, it is profitable, for it will direct a man the high-wayes of crossing di|vers Countries from place to place, which no other Book shews, as from <HI>Leicester</HI> to <HI>Linne</HI> in <HI>Norfolke,</HI> from <HI>Linne</HI> to <HI>Kingstone,</HI>

upon <HI>Hull</HI> in <HI>Yorkeshire,</HI> from <HI>Hull</HI> to <HI>Yorke,</HI> thence to <HI>Hallifax,</HI> to <HI>Chester, Darby, Nottingham, Coventry, Lichfield,</HI> and <HI>the Devils Ars a Peake:</HI> all these ways are here|in described; secondly, there are some Mo|numents of Antiquitie are mentioned, which greater Authours have omitted; thirdly, there are some passages of delight|full Mirth and Recreation. And lastly, all is true, or else you have the Authours leave to travell as hee hath done, and doe your best and worst to prove him a liar.</P>

<HEAD>Passages and Entertainments from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Leicester,</HI> with some observations of the said Town and Shire.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>UPon Saint <HI>Swithins</HI> day, I noted well,</L>
<L>The wind was calme, nor any rain then fell,</L>
<L>Which faire day (as old sawes saith) doth portend,</L>
<L>That heav'n to earth, will plenteous harvest send,</L>
<L>The morrow being <HI>Julies</HI> sixteenth day,</L>
<L>In my Progression I began my way.</L>
<L>I need not to relate the towns that lie</L>
<L>Just in my way, (as I road through or by)</L>
<L>Onely at <HI>Mims,</HI> a Cockney boasting bragger</L>
<L>In mirth, did aske the women for <HI>Belswagger,</HI></L>
<L>But strait the females, like the <HI>Furies fell,</HI></L>
<L>Did curse, scold, raile, cast dirt, and stones pell mell,</L>
<L><PB N="2" REF="4">But we betook us nimbly to our spurs,</L>
<L>And left them calling us rogues, knaves, and curs:</L>
<L>With other pretty names, which I discern'd</L>
<L>They from their old fore-mothers well had learn'd.</L>
<L>The reason why they are with rage inflam'd,</L>
<L>When as they heare <HI>Belswagger</HI> nam'd.</L>
<L>Is (as report doth say) there dwelt a Squire,</L>
<L>Who was so full of love, (or lusts desire)</L>
<L>That with his faire tongue, Hippocritick-hood,</L>
<L>(By slanderous people 'twas misunder stood)</L>
<L>The women were so fruitfull, that they were</L>
<L>All got with childe, in compasse of one yeare,</L>
<L>And that Squires name, they say, <HI>Belswagger</HI> was,</L>
<L>And from that tale, the lying jeere doth passe,</L>
<L>Wherefore the women there will chide and swagger,</L>
<L>If any man do aske them for <HI>Belswagger.</HI></L>
<L>Thence past I on my journy unto <HI>Hockly,</HI></L>
<L>Whereas I saw a Drunkard like a block lye,</L>
<L>There I alighted at the sanguine Lion,</L>
<L>Where I had meat, drink, and a bed to lie on.</L>
<L>The next day I road stately to <HI>Northampton,</HI></L>
<L>And all the way my horse most proudly stampt on,</L>
<L>On Thursday, trotting, galloping and ambling,</L>
<L>To <HI>Leister,</HI> I proceeded in my rambling:</L>
<L>There, at the <HI>blue Boare</HI> I was welcome than</L>
<L>Unto my brother <HI>Miles,</HI> a downright man,</L>
<L>Plain dealing, free from flattery, fraud or feare,</L>
<L>Who hath liv'd long with reputation there,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="4">He's old and honest, valiant, courteous, free:</L>
<L>(I write not this for making much of me)</L>
<L>But they that doubts on't, let them go and try</L>
<L>And if he be a changling, say I lie.</L>
<L>That house King <HI>Richard</HI> lodg'd in, his last night,</L>
<L>Before he did the field of <HI>Bosworth</HI> fight,</L>
<L>And there's a Room, a King to entertain,</L>
<L>The like is not in <HI>Leister</HI> Town again,</L>
<L>Th' Assizes then were there, some causes tride,</L>
<L>And Law did there the corps and souls divide,</L>
<L>Of two offenders, one had with a Knife</L>
<L>Stabd his contracted love, and reav'd her life,</L>
<L>'Tother, a wench that had stolne some poor rayment,</L>
<L>And fir'd the house, deserv'd the Hangmans pay|ment.</L>
<L>King <HI>Leir</HI> a Temple did to <HI>Janus</HI> reare</L>
<L>And plac'd a <HI>Flamine</HI> in't, there doth appeare</L>
<L>The arched Ovens foure yards thick at least,</L>
<L>Wherein they Heathen Sacrifices drest;</L>
<L>Like as the Jews in their Idolatry,</L>
<L>Offered their sonnes and daughters impiously,</L>
<L>To <HI>Moloeh, Nisroch, Ashtaroth,</HI> and <HI>Ball:</HI></L>
<L>And to those devillish gods adore and fall,</L>
<L>So people here, when warre or peace they sought;</L>
<L>They offrings unto <HI>Janus</HI> Temple brought;</L>
<L>This was eight hundred forty and foure yeare</L>
<L>Before our Saviours birth, built by King <HI>Leire,</HI></L>
<L>Long after <HI>Etheldred</HI> (the <HI>Mercian</HI> King)</L>
<L>Ahappy and a Christian change did bring</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="5">The Temple raz'd, the <HI>Flamine</HI> he defac'd,</L>
<L>And there a Christian Bishops Sea he plac'd,</L>
<L>Which lasted but few yeares, for then this Land</L>
<L>Was seven-fold yoaked, beneath 7 Kings command</L>
<L>And those Kings still were in perpetuall wars</L>
<L>That <HI>England</HI> was quite spoyl'd with endlesse jars</L>
<L>And in those Garboyles <HI>Leister</HI> had her share,</L>
<L>Spoyl'd, rifled, ransack'd, robd, and left most bare,</L>
<L>Till <HI>Edelfred,</HI> with great magnificence,</L>
<L>Repair'd and wall'd it strongly for defence.</L>
<L>Then did it flourish long in wealth and state,</L>
<L>Till second <HI>Henry</HI> it did ruinate:</L>
<L>He in out-ragious fury fir'd the Town,</L>
<L>Diswall'd it quite, and cast the Castle down,</L>
<L>So nothing but some raines doth appeare,</L>
<L>Whereby men may perceive that such things were.</L>
<L>Thus <HI>Leister</HI> fell, from state superlative,</L>
<L>Her fifty Churches all consum'd to five.</L>
<L>Yet it is faire and spacious at this day,</L>
<L>And East, West, North, and South 'tis every way</L>

<L>Yet one large fabrick there doth still abide</L>
<L>Whereby the good Dukes name is dignifide,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="5">And that's an Hospitall or Bead-house, where</L>
<L>One hundred and ten men are harbour'd there,</L>
<L>From perishing through want, still to defend</L>
<L>Those aged men untill the world shall end.</L>
<L>Twice every day a Chaplain doth repair</L>
<L>To them; and unto God sends prayse and prayer,</L>

<L>Good <HI>Henry</HI> Earle of <HI>Huntingdon</HI> (renown'd)</L>

<L>And when their knowltdge is with hope discernd,</L>
<L>They is the <HI>Greek</HI> may learn, and be more learn'd.</L>
</LG>
<P>But to relate somthing in profe of this ancient Towne of <HI>Leicester,</HI> in the time of nine weekes, which I abode there to and fro, I observed such a civill government and decency, which is not in many places to be found or equallized.</P>
<P>First, I noted the peace, tranquillity, and unity which the people live in, under the rule and command of the Major and his brethren, to
<PB N="6" REF="6">
whose authority and power (under the King) the inhabitants do willingly obay.</P>
<P>Secondly, the Clergy (or Ministery) are lear|ned, diligent, and painfull; and both Clergie and Layity, are conformable to the Orders and Dis|cipline of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and I did not heare of any one, residing there, that is, either Schismatically opinionated with Dogmaticall Whimseyes, or <HI>Amster-damnable</HI> Fopperies.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they are so charitable, and carefull in providing for the relief of the poore and nee|dy, that a man must go seek where to bestow his almes, for there is not any one (that I could see) that begg'd in the whole Town.</P>
<P>Fourthly, the streets are so well paved, and kept so clean from dunghils, filth, or soyle, that in the wettest or fowlest weather, a man may go all over the Towne in a paire of slippers, and never wet his feet.</P>
<P>Lastly, the people are generally so loving one to another, that the Lawyers want work, and so honest that the Apparitors are idle, and those few Drunkards which they have, are very civill and faire condition'd.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Certain other observations.</HEAD>
<P>There is a faire Library, and a well founded
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Almes-house within the Town, also two Gaoles, two houses of Correction, and for mad and fran|tick people. Also it is reported, that when King <HI>Richard</HI> the Third went from <HI>Leicester,</HI> to fight the battaile neer <HI>Bosworth,</HI> that then there was a man of mean calling (some say he was a Weaver, and some say a Plough-wright by his Trade) hee had a spirit of divination or Prophecie, of whom the Tyrant King <HI>Richard</HI> demanded some que|stions, what the event of that dayes fight might be to him, to whom the other (most bluntly an|swered, <HI>Marke my words King</HI> Richard, <HI>that as thou dost ride out of this Towne of</HI> Leicester, <HI>this morning thou shalt hit thy right foot against a stone, and as thou returnest thou shalt knocke thy head against the same:</HI> which proved true, for as he road, he did strike against the corner of a wall his foot, and after hee was slain in the field, hee was stript, and his body layd crosse behind a man on Hors-back, (like a Calfe) and in that vile and ignominious manner, as they brought his corps back to <HI>Leicester,</HI> his head did knocke a|gainst the aforesaid wall or stone, which place I saw there; also I went eight miles to see <HI>Red|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="2 letters">re</HI> field, where the King fell, which is a moo|rish kinde of ground, altogether unfruitfull, and the water doth seem red, which some foolish people do suppose to be the staine of K. <HI>Richards</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="7">
bloud; but it is onely the colour of the red earth that makes the water seeme so, and the ground close adjoyning is very fertile for Corne and Pasturage, but in the lower parts it is boggy and moory: by nature, and not either barren or blou|dy by any reason of the Kings death.</P>
<P>Another observation is concerning the altera|tion of the measures of Miles, and good sufficient Pots or Jugs of drink, but the further I travelled Northward, the more the miles were lengthe|ned, and the Pots shrunke and curtald; but in|deed, what the liquor wanted in measure it had in strength: the power of it being of such po|tencie, that it would fox a dry Traveller, before he had half quencht his thirst.</P>
<P>In this County of <HI>Leicester,</HI> I observed a piece of extream justice, executed upon three Geese, which was thus.</P>
<P>At a Village called <HI>Dadlington,</HI> eight miles from <HI>Leicester,</HI> there dwelsa Gentlewoman a Kinswoman of mine, who the last Trinity Tearm 1639 was at <HI>London,</HI> about some businesse in Law, which much concern'd her: and in her ab|sence, the Pinder of <HI>Dadlington,</HI> finding three of her Geese innocently grazing upon the Com|mon, for to shew the full power, force, vertue, and marrow of his office and authority, drave the Geese into the Pound or Pindfold, and be|cause
<PB N="9" REF="7">
they could procure no Bayle for their Re|lease, nor sureties for their true imprisonment, hee put all their three necks into a Horslock, which Engine or Neck-fetter was so strait, close, and pinching, that the Geese were all strangled: Now the question is whether <HI>Willy, Tilly,</HI> (the Pinder so silly) were the cause of their deaths, or whether the Geese did desperately cast away themselves: all which I humbly refer to the dis|cretion of the Jury.</P>
<P>But some Readers may muse why I do write so much of <HI>Leicester,</HI> in this little Book; the reason is that I lay there from the 17 of <HI>July,</HI> to the 20 of <HI>August,</HI> which was five weekes, but in the mean space, I road to <HI>Coventry,</HI> and return'd in a day to <HI>Leicester</HI> again, of <HI>Coventry</HI> I have little to say, but that it is a faire, famous, sweet, and an|cient City, so walled about with such strength and neatnesse, as no City in <HI>England</HI> may com|pare with it; in the wals (at severall places) are 13 Gates and Posterns whereby to enter, and is|sue too and from the City: and on the wals are 18 strong defensible Towers, which do also beauti|fie it: in the City is a faire and delicate Crosse, which is for structure, beauty, and workmanship, by many men accounted unmatchable in this Kingdome: although my selfe with some others, do suppose, that of <HI>Abington</HI> in <HI>Berkeshire</HI> will
<PB N="10" REF="8">
match it, and I am sure the Crosse in Cheapside at <HI>London</HI> doth farre out-passe it. I have bin at this City foure times, and have written of it before, and therefore at this time (my stay being so short there) I have but little to say, onely this that some are of opinion, that at the first itwas called <HI>Coventry,</HI> from the <HI>French</HI> word <HI>Trey Covent,</HI> be|cause there were founded three Covents, for three severall Orders of Friers, namely, the <HI>Franciscan</HI> Friers, the <HI>Augustine</HI> Friers, and the <HI>Dominicans:</HI> It matters not much who erected the said foundations and Covents, but it is cer|tain, that the renowned King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth did suppresse and demolish them, whose memo|ries now is almost quite buried in their owne ruines. <HI>Coventry</HI> is a County of it selfe, it hath been grac'd and dignified much by the Grant and Priviledges given to it by former Kings, a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter"> King <HI>Edward</HI> the Third, and King <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixt; The Majors name (at my being there, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter"> Master <HI>Thomas Forrest</HI> a Vintener) and Maste <HI>Thomas Phineas</HI> Sword-bearer there dyed at th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter"> beginning of the Sessions (much about the tim<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter"> of my being there) he was a man of that comel<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter"> bulke and corpulency, that his Coffin was a ful<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter"> yard wide at the shoulders, and it is said, that i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="in gutter" EXTENT="1 letter"> his life time hee could have been (at one meale the consumption of a large shoulder of Mutton,
<PB N="11" REF="8">
but he and his good stomack being both deceast, I left <HI>Coventry,</HI> because it was Sessions time, and returned to my Randevouze at <HI>Leister.</HI></P>
<P>The eleventh day of <HI>August</HI> I road from <HI>Lei|ster</HI> to <HI>Nottingham,</HI> where I lodged at the signe of the Princes Armes; but I was wel entertained at the house of the Right Worshipfull Sir <HI>Tho|mas Hutchinson</HI> Knight, himselfe and his good Lady made mee welcome, and did ex|presse their bounty to mee in good Cheere and Money: for the which I am heartily thank|full.</P>
<P>The Towne of <HI>Nottingham</HI> is seated on a Hill, which Hill is almost of one stony Rocke, or a soft kinde of penetrable sandy stone; it hath ve|ry faire buildings, many large streetes, and a spa|cious Market place: a great number of the inha|bitants (especially the poorer sort) doe dwell in vaults, holes, or caves, which are cut and digged out of, (or within) the Rocke: so that if a man be destitute of a house, it is but to goe to <HI>Not|tingham,</HI> and with a Mattock, a Shovell, a Crow of Iron, a Chizell, and Mallet, and such instru|ments, he may play the <HI>Mole,</HI> the Cunny, or the Pioner, and worke himselfe a Hole, or a Burrow, for him and his family: Where, over their heads the grasse and pasture growes, and beasts do feed; faire Orchards and gardens are their coverings, and Cowes are milkt upon the tops of their hou|ses.
<PB N="12" REF="9">
I was much befriended by Master <HI>Palmer</HI> the Iaylor there; for he went with me, and shew|ed me the (sometimes) strong and defencible Castle, but now much ruined: yet still there are many faire and sumptuous roomes in reasonable reparation and estate. On the lofty Battlements of the said Castle, there is a most spacious pro|spect round about: for from thence I could see the most stately Castle of <HI>Belvoyre</HI> or <HI>Bever</HI> Castle, which doth (as it selfe) belong to the Right Honourable the Earle of <HI>Rutland:</HI> and nearer hand, within three miles, I saw the an|cient Towne of <HI>Gotham,</HI> famous for the seven Sages (or Wise men) who are fabulously re|ported to live there in former ages.</P>
<P>In the aforesaid Castle of <HI>Nottingham,</HI> I was shewed divers strange wonderfull Vaults, cut or hewen out of the Rocke, whereof one is said to be the place where <HI>David</HI> King of <HI>Scots</HI> was detained many years in captivity: where the said King, with his owne hands (without any other instrument than the nayles of his fingers) did with the said tooles engrave and claw out the forme of our Saviours Life, death, and passion; which Worke is there to bee seene upon the Walls.</P>
<P>Also there is another Vault or passage through the Rocke, whereby men may descend or ascend out, or into the Castle; which vault is called
<PB N="13" REF="9">
<HI>Mortimers Hole,</HI> through which hole (as report goes) the great <HI>Roger Mortimer,</HI> Earle of <HI>Wig|mor,</HI> and Lord of <HI>Wallingford</HI> had egresse and re|gresse to the Queene, wife to King <HI>Edward</HI> the second, or the infortunate <HI>Edward</HI> of <HI>Carnarvan.</HI></P>
<P>Thus having seene as much of <HI>Nottingham</HI> Towne and Castle as is related; on the twelfth of <HI>August,</HI> I road to the ancient towne of <HI>Dar|by:</HI> On the thirteenth of <HI>August</HI> I left <HI>Darby,</HI> with an intent to retire to <HI>Leister;</HI> but after I had road halfe a Mile, I met with an acquain|tance of mine, who was travailing towards the <HI>Peake</HI> in <HI>Darby</HI> shire, to a Towne called <HI>Wirks|worth,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Chiesterfield,</HI> I retur|ned with him. The Country is very Mountai|nous, and many Lead Mines are found there|abouts: the best and most richest is called <HI>Dove Gany,</HI> within a mile or little more of <HI>Wirks|worth</HI> (corruptly called <HI>Wortsworth:)</HI> and two Miles from thence are most dangerous wayes, stony, craggy, with inaccessible Hils and Moun|taines: the grounds there are lawfull (as they told me) for any man to dig or mine in for Lead, be they of what condition soever: for the Laws of mining is, that those that will adventure their Labours shall have all the profits, paying the tenth part to the Lord or Landlord, of all the Lead which they get. If it happen that they take
<PB N="14" REF="10">
pains, a yeare or two in sundry places to finde a Myne if their fortune be so hard to finde none (as it often falls out so) they do work all that while for nothing, and finde themselves as they are a|ble, and in the end their toyle and labour is all lost: but if they doe hit upon a good Myne that doth hold out, and yield plentifully, then they may quickly enrich themselves (if they be good husbands.) I was told of a poore Thatcher that left his Trade, and venturing his time and pains, he found so rich a Lead Myne, that he would turn Gentleman, and he kept men in Liveries, living at the rate of the expence of 100 pound a week; so that he supposing that Leaden, Golden World would never be ended, took no care to save any thing, but after a while, the Myne failed, and hee spent that little which hee had left in digging for more, could finde none, so that for a conclu|sion, he forsook the <HI>Peake,</HI> and turnd Thatcher a|gain.</P>
<P>That part of the <HI>Peak,</HI> which is called the <HI>De|vils Ars,</HI> is at or neere a Towne named <HI>Castle|ton,</HI> or Castle Towne, so stiled from an ancient ruined Castle on a Hill, at the end of the Town, it is 30 miles from <HI>Darby,</HI> the Castle stands on the top of a Hill, and under it is a Cliff or Riffe in the said Hill, which is as wide at the entrance as three Barn doores, but being entred in it is
<PB N="15" REF="10">
enclosed again so narrow, that a man must stoop to passe further, but after that straight passage is past, there is rooms of incredible and wonder|full greatnesse, with strange and intricate tur|nings and windings, which no man can see with|out great store of lights, and by reason that those things are naturall, and formed without any att+or labour of man, and with all so dismall hot|rid, darke, and hideous, that place is called the <HI>Devils Ars a Peak,</HI> at or upon which I have (ac|cording to my promise) given three jerks with my pen, at the latter end of this Book.</P>
<P>From thence I returned towards <HI>Leicester</HI> 30 miles, on the 15 of <HI>August,</HI> and lodged at a Market Towne called <HI>Narbury,</HI> and the next day I came all tyred and weary (both man and beast to <HI>Leicester)</HI> and on the 20 day, I took my jour|ney 64 miles into <HI>Norfolke,</HI> to the famous Town of <HI>Linne,</HI> and three miles from thence, at a Vil|lage called <HI>Wooton,</HI> I was there well welcomed by Master <HI>Richard Miles</HI> (to whom I am and must be a thankfull Brother in Law) whose lo|ving kindnesse to me was shewed in such extra|ordinary manner, which because I cannot ex|presse, I will remayn gratefull with silence.</P>
<P>Concerning <HI>Linne,</HI> it is an excellent Sea-town and strong Port, it is gravely and peaceably go|verned by a Major, 12 Aldermen, and a Recor|der.
<PB N="16" REF="11">
It hath bin honored by divers, but chiefly by King <HI>John</HI> 440 yeares since, and by King <HI>Henry</HI> the Third, the first gave them a faire gilt Cup, which is there to be seene, as a witnesse of his Royall liberality: and who so will know more of <HI>Linne,</HI> let them goe thither and look the Re|cords of the Town, or else let them read Master <HI>Camdens Britania,</HI> or the painfull labours of Master <HI>Iohn Speed.</HI> The troth is, mine Hoast <HI>No|ble,</HI> was a noble Hoast to me, at whose house, my brothers kindred and friends, gave me a friend|ly farewell. On Tuesday the 27 of <HI>August,</HI> from <HI>Linne</HI> to <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>Lincolnshire</HI> 24 miles, where I dined with the right Worshipfull Sir <HI>Anthony Thomas</HI> Knight, from <HI>Boston</HI> I road 14 miles to <HI>Horn Castle,</HI> where I lodg'd the 28 of <HI>August.</HI> But I crave pardon of the Reader, for I had al|most forgotten a merry passage or two which hapned in <HI>Norfolke,</HI> not farre from <HI>Linne:</HI> and thus it was.</P>

was acted and personated a mizerly Farmer, that had much corne in his Barnes, and did expect a scant or barren Harvest, that through want and scarcity hee might sell his corne at what deare rates hee pleased, but (contrary to his wicked hopes) the Harvest proved abundantly plentifull, wherefore hee being in an extraordinary merry or mad veine, put himselfe to the charge of the buying of a two penny halter, and went into his Barn as secretly as he could, and putting the hal|ter about his neck with a riding knot, he fastned the other end to a beam, and most neatly hang'd himself: But (as ill luck would have it) his man presently came into the Barne, and espyde his Master so bravely mounted, the unlucky Knave drew his Knife and cut the halter, crying out for help as lowde as he could, rubbing and chafing his Master with all care and diligence to recover him to life again; at the last he awak'd out of his traunce, and fetch'd a deep groan, began to stare and look about him; and taking the end of the cut halter in his hand, his first words to his man was, Sirrah, who did cut this, O Master (said the fellow) it was I that did it, and I thank God that I came in good time to doe it, and I pray you to take God in your minde, and never more to ha|zard your soule and body in such a wicked man|ner: to which good counsell of the poor fellow,

And when the quarter day came, hee did a|bate the said two pence, for the which the fellow would dwell no longer with him, but went and got him another service: This was acted really and lately at the place aforesaid, in imitation of that part in the Play, of <HI>Every Man out of his Humour.</HI></P>

<P>Of <HI>Yorke</HI> I have but little to say, though it be a great, a faire, and the second City in <HI>England,</HI> built 989 years before our Saviours Birth, by <HI>E|brank</HI> King of this Land, from whom the City is called <HI>Eboracensis,</HI> this <HI>Ebrank</HI> is said to have 21 Wives, by whom he had 20 sonnes, and 70 daughters: he raigned here when as King <HI>Solo|mon</HI> Raigned in <HI>Ierusalem;</HI> hee overran <HI>France,</HI> he builded <HI>Alclaid,</HI> or <HI>Dumbritton</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> hee founded <HI>York,</HI> hee erected a Temple there, and therein plac'd a <HI>Flamine</HI> to <HI>Diana:</HI> but after (in King LUCIUS time) <HI>Elutherius</HI> pull'd downe the said Idolatrous wooden Tem|ple, and displac'd the <HI>Flamine,</HI> and caused tho Minster to be built in that magnificent manner of free stone, placing there an Archbishop; <HI>se|verus</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperour dyed there, and also there dyed the Emperour <HI>Flavius Vallerius Con|stantius</HI> (which some call <HI>Chlorus</HI>) those that will know more of <HI>York,</HI> let them reade Chro|nicles and larger Volumes.</P>

<P>From <HI>Yorke</HI> I rode after Dinner to <HI>Tadcaster,</HI> and so to a place called <HI>Kidell,</HI> where at a poore Ale-house I was glad of entertainment, and had the company of a Tinker who made pretty Mu|sique with his <HI>Banbury</HI> Kettle-drum, there was also with him two Drovers and 35 Hogs, which were to be driven on the morrow seven miles further to <HI>Leeds</HI> Market, this good lodging and company, I past the night with all, and on the morrow, I road to the Town of <HI>Leeds;</HI> of which Towne I must say somewhat. This Town is (for the bignesse of it) one the most populous Towns in <HI>England,</HI> it hath in it above 12000 people, and having but one Church there, it was not halfe capable to receive so great a Congregation, they were extremly thronged and dangerously crow|ded (especially in the heat of Summer, or sultry

contagious weather) that the most part of the people were inforc'd eyther to go two or three miles severall ways to other Village Churches, or else to stay at home and want the hearing of Gods Word, and the meanes of their salvation. The care and consideration of these Grievances entred into the pious minde of one Master <HI>John Harrison</HI> Gentleman there, (now living) so that God opened his heart, that of his owne proper costs he caused a Church to be built (though it have but the name of a Chappell) which is so large, that it will contain 4000 people, it is so neatly compacted and framed, with exquisite art of carving and Masonry, with painting, gilding, polishing, embellishing, and adorning, with a most stately Roofe, a fair losty Tower or Steeple, a sweet Ring of Bels; besides the admirable and costly Joyners and Carvers Workmanship in the Font, Pulpit, Pewes, Chancell, Communion Boord, and all other things and ornaments for the decent adornment of such a House consecra|ted and dedicated to the Service of God. I do absolutely affirme, that neither the Church or the Founder hath any fellows to be found.</P>
<P>This Chappell is called by the name of Saint <HI>Iohn Evangolist,</HI> it hath a faire Churchyard for Burials, well and strongly walled about, and at the West end of the Church-yard, the said Gen|tleman

hath founded a faire Almse-house, and therein placed 21 poore aged people; also hee hath founded and finished a faire School-house for the instruction of youth, and a fine sweet street hee hath built on both sides in a uniforme and faire manner, with Houses: the Rents whereof are for the mayntenance of the Almes|houses, the Schoole, and Reparations of the Church to the end of the World. And I leave this worthy Founder to God for a blessing, and to the World for imitation.</P>
<P>From <HI>Leeds</HI> I went to <HI>Wakefield,</HI> where if the valiant <HI>Pinder</HI> had been living, I would have play'd <HI>Don Quixot's</HI> part, and challenged him; but being it was so happy that he was dead, I past the Town in peace to <HI>Barnsley,</HI> and so to <HI>Wortley,</HI> to Sir <HI>Francis Wortleyes</HI> ancient House. The en|tertainment which himselfe, his good Lady, and his most faire and hopefull daughter gave mee there, as I never did or can deserve, so I never shall be able to requite, to talke of meat, drinke, money, and free welcome for Horse and Man, it were but a meer foolery for me to begin, because then I should run myself into a Labyrinth, out of which I should hardly finde the way: Therefore to his Worship, my humble thanks remembred, and everlasting happinesse wished, both to him and all that is his.

a little of the further favour of this Noble Knight. Upon the fourteenth of <HI>September</HI> after|noon, he took horse with mee, and his Lady and daughter in their Coach, with some other Ser|vants on horseback; where three miles we rode over Rocks and Cloud-kissing Mountains, one of them is so high, that (in a cleere day) a man may from the top thereof see both the Minsters or Ca|thedrall Churches, <HI>Yorke</HI> and <HI>Lincolne,</HI> neere 60 miles off us; and as it is to be supposed, <HI>That when the Devill did looke over Lincolne, as the Pro|verbe is)</HI> that hee stood upon that Mountaine) or neer it: Sir <HI>Francis</HI> brought me to a Lodge, the place is called <HI>Wharncliffe,</HI> where the Keeper dwels, who is his man, and keeps all this Woody, Rocky, Stony, Vast Wildernesse under him, for there are many Deere there, and the Keeper were an Asse if he would want Venison, having so good a Master.</P>
<P>Close to the said Lodge, is a Stone in burthen at the least 100 cart loads, the top of it is foure square (by Nature) and about 12 yards compasse, it hath three seats in the forme of Chaires, made by art (as it were in the front of the Rocke) wherein three persons may easily sit, and have a view and goodly prospect over large Woods, Towns, Corn-fields, fruitfull and pleasant Pa|stures, Valleyes, Rivers, Deere, Neat, Sheep; and all things needful for the life of man: contayned

in thousands of Acres and all (or the better part, belonging to that Noble Knights Ancestors, and himself.

About a Bow shoot from thence (by the descent of many rungs of a ladder) his Worship brought mee to a Cave or Vault in a Rocke, wherein was a Table with feats, and Turfe Cushions round, and in a hole in the same Rock, was three Barrels of nappy liquour, thither the Keeper brought a good Red Deere Pye, cold roast Mutton, and an excellent shooing-born of hang'd <HI>Martimas</HI> Biefe: which cheer no man living would thinke such a place could afford: so after some merry passages and repast, we returned home.</P>
<P>On the fifth of <HI>September,</HI> I hired a Guide, and rode to <HI>Hallifax</HI> 16 miles, the ways were so rocky, stony, boggy and mountaynous, that it was a days journey to ride so short a way. At <HI>Hallifax</HI> I saw the fatall <HI>Engine,</HI> wherewith they do behead pilfering Thieves, which Sir <HI>Francis Wontley</HI> told me was set upon this occasion fol|lowing.</P>

Now the Engine is two high pieces of Timber, an ell or yard asunder, fixed and closed on the top, with a crosse piece like a Gallowse; in the inner sides of the two standing pieces are two gutters, and on the top (or crosse piece is a pulley through which they do put a small Line or Rope, and fast|ning it to another heavyer piece of wood of 100 weight (in which they doe fix the sharp-edge-toole) then they doe pull or hoyst up the said weight, and the stolne goods is brought to the place of execution with the Malefactor; now one end of the Rope is made fast to a pinne or stake, which being cut, the Engine fals so pon|derously

and speedily, that it sovers the head from the body in a moment, but there is no man will or must cut the Line, but the Owner of the stolne goods, which if he do, hee hath all again: if he will not cut it, then he must lose all, and it is em|ployed to some charitable uses; by which means the Thiefe escapes; and this is <HI>Hallifax</HI> law.</P>
<P>The sixt day I left <HI>Hallifax,</HI> and road oversuch wayes as are past comparison or amending, for when I went downe the lofty Mountaine called <HI>Blackstone Edge,</HI> I thought my selfe with my Boy and Horses had been in the land of <HI>Break|neck,</HI> it was so steep and tedious, yet I recove|red 12 miles to <HI>Rochdale,</HI> and then I found smooth way to <HI>Manchester,</HI> and to <HI>Sandy</HI> Lane end 13 miles; and to <HI>Chester</HI> 14 miles, which was the furthest place of my tedious travell.</P>
