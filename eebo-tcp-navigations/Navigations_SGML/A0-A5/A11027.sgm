<P>Chri&s;ts Prophecie is nowe performde, the daies waxe wor&s;e and wor&s;e, &amp; charitie is growne colde: For if mercie had had any gouernment among Chri&s;tian men, &s;o many beaute|ous. Townes, goodly Cities, glorious Kingdomes had not (as nowe they are) either b&eacute;ene vtterly made wa&s;te, or &s;uffered the woefull bondage of Turki&s;h
<PB REF="3"> tyrannie. The flouri&s;hing Churches to which Chri&s;ts Apo&s;tles writ, and in which they and the fir&s;t Fathers of the Church laboured, are now the recep|tacles of vnhallowed multitudes, and onely a &s;mall corner of the earth profe&s;&s;eth Chri&s;t.

<P><HI>Amurath</HI> now Emperour of <HI>Turkey,</HI> glorying in the v&s;urped &s;eate of the Greeki&s;h Emperre, not long &s;ince &s;ubiected by <HI>Mahomet</HI> the &s;onne of <HI>Amurath</HI> his predece&s;&s;our, ambitiou&s;ly by his tyrannous Ba&s;&s;aes incited, hath attempted the affliction of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> the vnconquered part of <HI>Hungarie, Poland, Heluetia,</HI> and other Kingdomes neighbouring <HI>Greece,</HI> who&s;e proc&eacute;edinges &s;ince the 25. of December la&s;t, till the middle of Ianuarie, this &s;mall Pamphlet handleth.</P>
<P><HI>Rab</HI> is a towne n&eacute;ere <HI>Donow</HI> in <HI>Hungarie,</HI> which in the end of the la&s;t Harue&s;t, the Turkes violently after long &s;iege entred, &s;paring neither age nor &s;exe, but making the Infants daies equall with the aged Elders, both young and old by their crueltie at once peri&s;hed. The winning of which place hath not &s;mal|ly weakned the other Forts of <HI>Hungaria,</HI> in the Chri|&s;tians power. After they had tyrannou&s;ly in&s;ulted o|uer <HI>Rab,</HI> they immediatlie bent their forces again&s;t <HI>Comar,</HI> the people of which Citie a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the hand of God, and re&s;olued rather to die than &s;ubiect them|&s;elues to the &s;lauerie of Infidels, valiantly defended
<PB REF="3"> them&s;elues, and violently compelled, the huge multi|tude of the Turkes to rai&s;e their &s;iege and retire to <HI>Rab</HI> which they had lately taken. From &s;undry parts of Chri&s;tendome &s;ince the 25. of December the&s;e certaine and vnreprooueable intelligences haue b&eacute;ene &s;ent: <HI>videlicet,</HI> it is certified from Rome the la&s;t of Ianuarie.</P>
<P>The Emperours Maie&s;ties Legates had audience before the Pope, who de&s;ired a &s;ub&s;idie &s;hould be leui|ed on the Cleargie, for the cutting off of an Arme of the Riuer of <HI>Donow,</HI> that falls in by <HI>Comar,</HI> thereby not only to defend the &s;aid towne and the parts there|abouts, but al&s;o to hinder the Turkes from enter|cour&s;e to <HI>Oouen:</HI> and be&s;ides it would bee a meane to &s;pare many Souldiers that mu&s;t be imployed in the&s;e parts. To this the Pope condi&s;cended; with promi&s;e to aide the Emperour with all he might. <HI>Iu&s;tiniano</HI> is appointed the Collector.</P>
<P>The &s;ame time al&s;o it was certified that the great Ma&s;ter of <HI>Malta</HI> was reconciled, b&eacute;eing authori&s;ed from the Pope to be accountable to no E&s;tate.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o concluded, that the Prince of <HI>Seuenbergh,</HI> otherwi&s;e called <HI>Heluetia,</HI> vpon who&s;e burden the fir&s;t war betw&eacute;ene the Turkes and Chri&s;tians mu&s;t n&eacute;edes lye, &s;hall haue 20000.

<P>Moreouer at <HI>Rome</HI> the &s;ame day arriued this newes, that the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Toledo</HI> in Spaine, being ninetie foure yeares of age decea&s;ed, and left behinde him a Million of readie money, halfe a Milli|on in debts, and &s;ixe hundred thou&s;and Crownes in Plate, Roabes, co&s;tly apparrell and other Iewels:

Remember the willingnes of your fore-fathers in that great Ex|pedition to <HI>Ieru&s;alem,</HI> vnder the leading of <HI>Godfrey</HI> Duke of <HI>Bulloigne.</HI> Then Princes, Noblemen, and well di&s;po&s;ed people, came in per&s;on from the vt|mo&s;t VVe&s;terne Kingdomes, euen from <HI>England, France, Netherland,</HI> and <HI>Scotland:</HI> the women gaue the &s;ouldiers their bracelets of gold and &s;iluer, yea, poore &s;eruants offred of their &s;mall wages to maine|taine that holy VVarre. Ah, where is that pitie, care, true loue and mercie now become? The Turki&s;h &amp; vnbeleeuing Enemies are come by manie Kingdoms farre neerer your homes, and your commi&s;eration is by manie degrees farther off. Let <HI>Antioch,</HI> the fir&s;t Citie wherein the name of Chri&s;tians began (nowe made a Synagogue of vnbeleeuing Infidels) moue
<PB REF="9"> ye to compa&s;sion. The Candle&s;tickes are remoued from the Churches in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> as S. <HI>Iohn</HI> prophecied: the light of Chri&s;tianitie is wholly extinct among them. In <HI>Syria</HI> Chri&s;ts Spou&s;e hath lo&s;t her beautie. In the Emperie of <HI>Greece,</HI> Kingdomes of <HI>Epyrus, Ly&s;tria, Crete, Cyprus,</HI> and other the Mediterranean Nati|ons, CHRIST had (&amp; that within the&s;e few yeres) his beloued Vineyard, planted, tended, wel dre&s;&s;ed, compa&s;&s;ed about. But now the Turkes (like wilde Boares are entred, the Vineyard is wa&s;ted. In &s;tead of wine, the earth (in all tho&s;e and diuers other king|domes) is drunke with Chri&s;tian blood: and there is no face of Chri&s;tianitie left, no outward Church. Let that part of our Kingdomes alreadie lo&s;t, &amp; the re&s;t now hazarding, win ye to &s;ome compa&s;sion.</P>
<P>But it may be, becau&s;e the Turke is farre off, you thinke he neuer can haue power to hurt ye, you and your children &s;hall be &s;afe. Be not &s;o gro&s;e conceip|ted. Con&s;ider, wee had Fathers that gathered for vs, &s;o had the <HI>Greekes,</HI> and other the forenamed Na|tions: but now their welth and ours lies open to the Enemie. VVe had hou&s;es, but Turkes po&s;&s;es them: Pallaces, but they are &s;poyled: Churches, but they are prophaned: Cities, but they are wa&s;ted: &amp; &s;ome more we haue, but how long they &s;halbe ours, we li|tle know. And yet within the&s;e few yeres, wee were thrice farther off from daunger than you now are. Neither flatter your &s;elues that your Countryes are populous, your Cities &s;trong, your Kingdomes fen|ced with the Sea: they and we had peopled King|domes, fenced Cities, &s;ea-walled Ilands, but all was vaine, they were &s;ingled one by one, their neighbors denied them helpe, and fir&s;t they, then tho&s;e deniers peri&s;hed. Such will our ca&s;e be, if we be not aided: &s;uch will yours be, if ye doo not aid vs.</P>
<PB REF="10">
<P>Be&s;ides, there is a rumour &s;pred in &s;ome partes of Chri&s;tendome, how the Turkes are iu&s;t in keeping faith and promi&s;e. O fond and idle beliefe: What faith can they keepe that haue no faith?</P>
<P>Such faith as not long &s;ince they kept with that noble Chri&s;tian Prince of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> the Turki&s;h Em|perour him&s;elfe pa&s;&s;ing his word vnto him. When that mo&s;t Princely Chri&s;tian VVarriour, had defen|ded <HI>Famago&s;ta</HI> till all munition and vittaile failed: hee and his &s;mall companie yet worthely re&s;oluing, intended deerely to &s;el their liues, and &s;tood valiant|ly to defend the breaches. The Turke &s;eeing their re&s;olution, offred the Prince, that if hee would &s;ur|render the Citie, him&s;elfe and the &s;ouldiers, wyth theyr Armes, weapons, and colours di&s;plaied, the Prince&s;&s;e with her children, the other women, peo|ple, and children of the Citie with bag and baggage &s;hould pa&s;&s;e quietly through the Turkes Armie, and bee tran&s;ported to what Hauen in Chri&s;tendome they de&s;ired. The Prince accepted the&s;e conditions, the Turki&s;h Emperor confirmed them with an: oath: but (like a fal&s;e mi&s;creaunt) when they were i&s;&s;ued, hee compelled the Prince and the able men to beare burthens of earth vppon their &s;houlders to repayre the breaches: then commaunded the Prince&s;&s;e, her children, the women and other weake people (after manie &s;hamefull abu&s;es) to be cruelly tortured to death. Then &s;tripped they the Souldiers and chay|ned them for &s;laues. La&s;tly they puld out the wo|full Princes eyes, punched his warlike bodie full of hoales, and hangd him on the top ma&s;t of their Ad|mirall Galley, more to afflict his poore &s;ubiects that rowed there as &s;laues.</P>
<P>Such faith will they keepe as with the la&s;t Empe|rour of <HI>Greece</HI> they did: whom (after many frendly
<PB REF="10"> &s;eeming Amba&s;&s;ades) they &s;odainly be&s;ieged in his chiefe Citie <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and in the chiefe Gate of that Citie, he and his children were found mangled wyth manie wounds, and trampled with their hor|&s;es feete.</P>
<P>Such faith will they keepe as lately they did wyth vs of <HI>Hungarie:</HI> Hauing taken certaine yongmen of noble Families. Wee laboured for their libertie to the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Buda.</HI> Their ran&s;ome was &s;et downe, and licen&s;e granted for their frends to bring it. The Ba&s;&s;a him&s;elfe receiued it: and then tyrannou&s;lie to &s;euerall &s;takes he tyed the mi&s;erable yong Gentle|men naked, and in pre&s;ence of their friends cau&s;ed their bodies to be &s;liced with &s;harpe kniues, the fle&s;h ca&s;t vnto hungrie dogs, and the dead carca&s;&s;es deli|uered their &s;orrowfull friends for the raun&s;ome they had paid.</P>
<P>This is the Turki&s;h faith, this their vow, this their religion: let no Chri&s;tian State beleeue them, nor for lucre hold league with them, for they doo await time fir&s;t to de&s;troy vs, then to extirpate them.</P>
<P>What &s;hould wee &s;ay that you cannot conceiue, looke on your Cities, Pallaces, Fieldes, Meadowes, walkes, plea&s;ant Gardens, thinke ours were like yours, but nowe are nothing but receptacles of &s;or|row. Looke on your wiues and beauteous daugh|ters, and remember that we haue &s;uch (though not &s;o fortunate) yours &s;afe, ours &s;ubiect to raui&s;hment and &s;poile. Looke on your &s;onnes and forget not ours, of whom no &s;mall number are alreadie with their wofull fathers chained in Turki&s;h &s;lauerie, the re&s;t oppo&s;ing them&s;elues again&s;t their tyrannie. And then remember it is in his quarrell wee &s;triue, that hath promi&s;ed to reward a cup of colde water giuen in his name: much more reward againe with tenne
<PB REF="11"> folde ble&s;&s;ings, your Chri&s;tian mercie and pittie to|ward vs.</P>
<P>To him that is able to helpe as well by one as ma|nie, we commit our&s;elues: and commend the con|&s;ideration of our mi&s;erable e&s;tate to your Chri&s;tian Charities.</P>
