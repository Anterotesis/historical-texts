<PB N="2" REF="5"> <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> miles, and from the 25. to the 65. degree of longitude, or 2400 of our miles. On the &s;outh &s;ide, it borders on <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Denmarke;</HI> on the North and We&s;t, on the Ocean Sea, and on the Ea&s;t on <HI>Ru&s;sia.</HI> The parts of this countrey lying neere&s;t to the South, where the Pole is not ele|vated above 60 degrees is indifferent temperat; the Region lying betwixt the 60. degree and the arctick circle, are not &s;o temperate, howbeit, the intemperature of the ayre is well regulated with the fertility of the &s;oyle, in &s;uch places e|&s;pecially as are not covered over with woods, or rocks, in the &s;outh &amp; ea&s;terne parts principally. But the extreme, or mo&s;t notthern parts, lying betwixt the arctick circle, and the pole arctick, enjoy neither a temporate ayre, nor yet a fruitful &s;oile, and &s;ince, by rea&s;on of the faint heat of the Sun, corne could not there well ripen, therefore the wi&s;e Creator of all things hath furni&s;hed the&s;e countries with great variety of wild bea&s;ts and divers rivers, lakes &amp; gulfes furni&s;hed with variety of whole&s;ome fi&s;hes, for the &s;u&s;taining of the inhabitants lives. It would &s;eem that this <HI>Scandia</HI> was in former times far more populous, then it is at this time, witne&s;&s;e the&s;e frequent tran&s;migrations, and, as it were, inundations of the <HI>Scanzian</HI> people into other remote regions of the world; when as partly by rea&s;on of the mul|titude, and naturall fecundity or fruitfulnes of that people, partly by rea&s;on of dearth of corn, &amp; partly by their inclination to war and avoyding idlenes, like Bees they &s;ought out new hives for
<PB N="3" REF="5"> them&s;elves and their children, and tho&s;e great heapes of &s;tones, even at this day in the mo&s;t de&s;arts &amp; woods to be &s;een, &amp; in former times, no doubt gathered together to clean&s;e the high waies, do undoubtedly evidence unto us, that in former times all tho&s;e places have bin peopled, and therefore not without great rea&s;on, did the ancient writers call this country, a &s;hop of peo|ple: <HI>Officinam gentiu~ populoru~ que vaginam,</HI> &amp; from hence have we not only the <HI>Normans, Suevians, Vandals,</HI> &amp; divers other nations: but the <HI>We&s;tor|goths,</HI> and <HI>O&s;trogoths,</HI> al&s;o who after many pere|grinations, thorow many Provinces and King|domes, whom they wearied out with their wars, at length they &s;etled them&s;elves in <HI>Spain,</HI> where even at this day they beare rule.</P>

<PB N="4" REF="6"> <HI>Haraldus Har&s;agher,</HI> being lineally de&s;cended in the fourth degree, having vanqui&s;hed and ex|pelled all the other petty Kings, did there fir&s;t of all e&s;tabli&s;h an ab&s;olute Monarchy, as wit|ne&s;&s;eth the ancient Chronicle of <HI>Norway,</HI> writ|ten by Ma&s;ter <HI>Iohn Martinus Slangerupen&s;is,</HI> and publi&s;hed in <HI>Denmarke, Anno.</HI> 1595.</P>
<P>Of this kingdome of <HI>Sweden,</HI> I purpo&s;e now to &s;ay &s;ome thing, as I finde it written in the <HI>Swe|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h</HI> Hi&s;tory, howbeit, as briefely as I can: and &s;peaking of the countrey, I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething of the &s;everal Provinces and Territories belong|ing to this Crowne, the commodities and riches they yeeld, both to King and Subject; as al&s;o concerning the politicke government, together with divers cu&s;tomes of this countrey. In the next place, &s;omething &s;hall be &s;aid of the might and power of this great King, both by Sea and Land, his chiefe Officers of State, &amp;c. and then come wee to the Kings of that countrey, both ancient and of latter times, with &s;ome of their chiefe acts, and the latter Kings alliances. In the la&s;t place is &s;omething more particularly &s;aid concerning this great <HI>Gu&s;tavus Adolphus</HI> now raigning, and his chiefe acts, both before and &s;ince his expedition into <HI>Germany,</HI> briefly hand|led.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> or <HI>Swethland,</HI> call it as you li&s;t, although untill now of late yeeres, not &s;o much taken notice of in the&s;e parts of the world as many other Princes and Potentates; yet may
<PB N="5" REF="6"> it well appeare that hee is no meane Prince, nor of &s;mall power. His chiefe countrey, and from which he takes his chiefe denomination, is cal|led by &s;ome <HI>Suconia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suconia.</NOTE> and the people from thence <HI>Sucones:</HI> as al&s;o, and with us mo&s;t frequently <HI>Suevia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Suevia.</NOTE> and the people <HI>Swevi;</HI> now there is in high <HI>Germany,</HI> another countrey founding &s;ome|what like it, called <HI>Suevia,</HI> the people <HI>Suevi,</HI> and in high <HI>Dutch, Swaben,</HI> bordering on <HI>Bavaria,</HI> be|ing a colonie in former times come out of this countrey of <HI>Sweden,</HI> of whom my purpo&s;e is not here to &s;peake. This potent King then hath un|der his dominion, not onely this country of <HI>Swe|den,</HI> properly &s;o called, but al&s;o <HI>Gothland, Flint|land,</HI> and a great part of <HI>Lapland,</HI> be&s;ides &s;ome Territories in the dominion of the great Duke or Knez of <HI>Ru&s;sia,</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;covia,</HI> as hereafter &s;hall appeare. This countrey is a very fruitfull &s;oyle, a land flowing with milke and honey, and yeel|ding corne in great abundance; be&s;ides the great abundance of mettalls digged out of the bowells of the earth, and the excellency of the pa&s;tures of this land, may from hence appeare, that &s;ome countrey people of <HI>Holland,</HI> removing their habitation into <HI>Sweden,</HI> affimed that they made as much butter of 60. mea&s;ures of milke there, as they did in <HI>Holland</HI> of a hundred the like mea&s;ures. This plea&s;ant countrey is reple|ni&s;hed with innumerable lakes, furni&s;hed with mo&s;t dainty fi&s;hes; &amp; out of the&s;e &s;ame lakes do run and i&s;&s;ue out many plea&s;ant and profitable
<PB N="6" REF="7"> rivers. This country is in the South parts more plain &amp; even; but towards the North and We&s;t more mountainous, not without great &s;tore of woods, very u&s;efull for the fining of tho&s;e met|tals, in &s;o great abundance digg'd out of many of tho&s;e mountaines. The maritane parts not of <HI>Swethland</HI> onley, but of <HI>Finland</HI> al&s;o, are for the mo&s;t part environed with high and &s;teepe rocky hils &amp; Ilands, many of them being &s;carce cove|red with greene gra&s;&s;e, and this is the cau&s;e why it is &s;o hard and difficult a matter for &s;trangers, without &s;ome skilfull Pilot of the naturall inha|bitans, to &s;aile neere their &s;hore, and &s;trangers at their fir&s;t approaching wonder that &s;uch a coun|try &s;hould afford the inhabitants meanes to &s;u|&s;taine life, until &s;uch time, as they are better ac|quainted with the inner parts of the countrey; and this land hath likewi&s;e commerce with the Ile of <HI>Brittaine Denmarke, Norway, Poland, Ru&s;sia,</HI> and &s;uch other Notherne Regions beyond the 50 or 51 degrees of Northerly latitude, that it bringeth forth none of that noble liquor of the grape, which is notwith&s;tanding in great abun|dance brought from other countries, and be|&s;ides, they are well furni&s;hed with good ale and beere for their ordinary drinke.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IIII.</HI> Of the Politicke and civill govern|ment of the Kingdome of Sweden.</HEAD>
<P>IN ancient times each Province of this king|dome had it's &s;everall lawes and con&s;titutions, whereof, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, there were divers au|thours, who&s;e names, by rea&s;on of the long tract of time, are now for the mo&s;t part buried in ob|livion.</P>
<P>And the Ve&s;trogothian lawes are &s;o ancient, that it is apparant they were made at &s;uch times as the Goths departed out of this kingdome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiquities of the Ve&s;tro|gothian lawes</NOTE> or at lea&s;t &s;hortly after: for there is mention made of the Goths inhabiting Greece and Thracia: to wit, that none of them &s;hould enioy or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e any of their ancient po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in their owne countrey, unle&s;&s;e they would returne and dwell
<PB N="42" REF="25"> there. And it is apparent that they dwelt there before the times of <HI>Alexander</HI> the great, who, as he affirmed, were to be &s;hunned and taken heede of. Be&s;ides, even before the incarnation of our Lord and Saviour, they were &s;uch a terror to the Romans, that they were by them much hindered from inlarging their dominion beyond the Da|nubius. Now the&s;e lawes doe for the mo&s;t part agree with the lawes of the Vi&s;igoths, &s;et down by <HI>I&s;idorus,</HI> although they be farre &s;horter; for the which cau&s;e it is not unlike that the&s;e &s;ame lawes of <HI>I&s;idrus</HI> were at the fir&s;t collected out of the con&s;titutions of the Ve&s;trogoths, and after, as the titles te&s;tifie enlarged by the kings of the Vi&s;igoths of Spaine. Out of all the&s;e Provincial lawes and other con&s;titutions of this kingdome, did the Bi&s;hops and Senatours thereof above 270 yeares agoe compile this generall law, very agreeable to the law of nature, and not much differing from the civill law, but that by this controverted ca&s;es are far &s;peedilier ended. But before we &s;peake any thing concerning their lawes, we will premit &s;ome generalities. In this kingdome therefore there are &s;everall principall colledges or &s;ocieties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The whole government of this king|dome com|prehended in certaine &s;oci|eties or col|ledges.</NOTE> which comprehend the whole government of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e is called the Colledge of Iu|&s;tice,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Colledge or &s;ocietie of Iu&s;tice.</NOTE> in the wihch are three degrees or rankes: the &s;upreame, the middle mo&s;t, and lowe&s;t of all. In this &s;upreame or highe&s;t ranke or order, are the noble Senators of the kingdome: in the
<PB N="43" REF="25"> next are &s;uch as they call Lagman; and in La|tin Nomophylaces, as if we &s;hould &s;ay; Recorders or Regi&s;ters. In the third ranke or order are the Iudges of particular cities or townes, being men of good e&s;teeme, and of hone&s;t life and con|ver&s;ation, and not unskilfull in the lawes of the land. In this &s;upreame court are iudged cau&s;es of the whole kingdome, as well criminall as ciuill; and to this &s;upreame court, the &s;ubiect may from any inferiour Court of the kingdome appeale, whereas they determine and iudge whether the inferiour court hath iudged right or no; and from this court there is no appeale, un|le&s;&s;e it be to the king him&s;elfe, in who&s;e power it is either to qualifie the puni&s;hment, or to re|mit the offence. Vnder this &s;uprame court are immediatly &s;ubiected and &s;ubordinate two o|thers, that of criminall cau&s;es, and that of the court or chamber.</P>
<P>The next to this colledge is the colledge of war, wherein are handled all Martiall or Mili|tary affaires, and is called the Court mar&s;hall or martiall.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Colledge or &s;ocietie is that of warre, or court Mar&s;hall.</NOTE> To this court belongs the Councell of War. wherein are all military matters deli|berated and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed: and over this court pre|&s;ides the great Mar&s;hall of the kingdome.

<P>The third colledge or court is that of the Chan|cerie;<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 Colledge, the court of the Chancery</NOTE> in which are handled all manner of cau&s;es both civill and eccle&s;ia&s;ticall.

<P>The fourth Colledge or Court is that of the Admiraltie,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4 Colledge, the Admirall court.</NOTE> over which is the great Lord Ad|mirall; who&s;e office is to over&s;ee the Navy roy|all,

To his court belong all cau&s;es concerning tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es again&s;t con&s;titutions made for the pre&s;er|vation of the Navy-royal, and many other things concerning maritime affaires.</P>
<P>The fifth and la&s;t is the Exchequer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5 Colledge is the Exche|quer.</NOTE> or, as the French call it, the chamber of accounts, where are received all the revenues belonging to the crowne, tributes, cu&s;tomes, &s;ub&s;idies, &amp;c.

He payes al&s;o all the kings armie, and &s;o doth hee all the kings &s;er|vants their wages, In a word hee takes all, and payes all, being accomptable to no body, but to the king him&s;elfe.</P>
<P>Among&s;t all the great officers of the kingdome, the Lord Mar&s;hall is accounted the chiefe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Lord Mar&s;hals of|fice.</NOTE> be|ing ma&s;ter of the kings hou&s;hold, and admini|&s;trator or orderer of the great coun&s;ell; who by the kings authority, hath power to a&s;&s;emble the whole States of the land, to command &s;ilence and attention, to give leave to &s;peake in Parlia|ment,
<PB N="46" REF="27"> to welcome ofrreine Emba&s;&s;adours, and to provide things nece&s;&s;ary for their entertain|ment. To his office al&s;o it belongeth to remove out of the coun&s;ell &s;uch as belong not thereunto, and to &s;ee the kings decrees, concerning mat|ters of defamation, and puni&s;hment of death du|ly put in execution.

Now as many as are the Provinces, as many are there of the&s;e &s;upreame iudges: to eleven, under whom are againe above 300. Vi|counties, or particular iuri&s;dictions; not unlike the courts of Parliament of France, and the mul|titude of pre&s;idiall courts. But the difference is, that the&s;e &s;upreame Iudges vi&s;it every yeare a great part of their Province, untill all their Pro|uinces be vi&s;ited, and when they have travelled the round, they returne againe where they fir&s;t began (which the French Parliaments doe not) much after the manner of the Iudges circuits in this kingdome. And as this cour&s;e is very con|venient for the remedying of the publike di&s;ea|&s;es of the kingdome; &s;o is it al&s;o &s;ome ea&s;e to the &s;ubiect, the&s;e iudges demanding the tribute and taxes by turnes, and not all at once, of &s;uch territories and pari&s;hes as they vi&s;it, that &s;o the people be not all burdened at one and the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>It is yet further to be ob&s;erved, that by the ancient cu&s;tomes and con&s;titutions of this king|dome, be&s;ides all the&s;e aforementioned courts, there was yet one generall court commanded to be kept in foure eminent places of the king|dome once or twice a yeere, for determining and fini&s;hing &s;ome ca&s;es, which by the other

The Iudges were without faile to appeare at the place appointed in proper per&s;on &s;ixe weekes after the publication of &s;uch a mee|ting.

<PB N="49" REF="28"> were &s;everely puni&s;hed. Now the king is &s;ixe weekes before the time of &s;itting to intimate the fame to his &s;ubiects.

<P>The next way by which the kings revenues are increa&s;ed, is from the fruits of the earth, and his cu&s;tomes as well by &s;ea as by land: for the king hath the tythes of all manner of graine, wheate, rye, barly, &amp;c. as al&s;o of butter &amp; chee&s;e of bea&s;ts, hides, fi&s;h, and the like; the certainty of which reuenues although it be not to us a&s;&s;u|redly knowne; yet no que&s;tion ari&s;eth it to no &s;mall &s;umme, and as is credible, to little le&s;&s;e then 9 or 10. millions &s;ay their writers: but this mu&s;t be under&s;tood of their owne coine and ac|count, not of Sterline money.</P>

Out of the country of Lapland the Northermo&s;t of all his Provin|ces the king receives a great number of the&s;e skins or rich furs.

<P>The&s;e rich furs the king di&s;po&s;eth of among his kindred and friends: and &s;ometimes al&s;o

<P>But the Nobles and chiefe Gentrie, and their tenants are for the mo&s;t part freed from the&s;e impo&s;itions, unle&s;&s;e upon very urgent and im|portant occa&s;ions. But if there be an extreame nece&s;&s;itie, and there be not otherwi&s;e &s;ufficient &s;upply, then their va&s;&s;als and tenants are tyed to pay halfe of the taxe or &s;ub&s;idie, as well as tho&s;e who are immediately &s;ubiect to the king him|&s;elfe.</P>
