<HEAD>&para; To the ryght honorable and my &s;ingular good Lady. <HI>Elizabeth Countes of Shrew&s;bury. Thomas Harman wi&s;heth all ioye</HI> and perfite felicitie here and in the worlde to come.</HEAD>
<P>_AS of Auncient and longe tyme, there hath bene and is now at this pre&s;ent many good godly profitable lawes and actes made and &s;et forthe in this mo&s;te noble and flory&s;hynge realme, for the reliefe, &s;uccour, comforte and &s;u&s;tentacion of the poore nedye impotente and my+&s;erable creatures, beinge and in habiting in all parts of the &s;ame. So is there (righte honorable and myne e&s;pecyall good Lady) mo&s;t hol&s;om e&s;tatutes, ordinances and nece&s;&s;ary lawes, made &s;etforth and publi&s;hed for the extreme puni&s;hement of all vagaran|tes and &s;turdy vacabons, as pa&s;&s;eth throughe and by all parts of this famous yle mo&s;t ydelly and wyckedly, And I wel by good experience vnder&s;tandinge and con&s;ideringe your mo&s;t tender, pytyfull, gentle and noble nature, not onelye hauinge a vygelant and mercifull eye to your poore indygente and feable pari&s;hnores, yea not onely in the pari&s;he where your honour mo&s;t happely doth dwell, but al&s;o in o|thers, inuyroninge or nighe adioyninge to the &s;ame. As al&s;o aboun|dantly powrynge out dayly your ardent and bountifull charytie vp|pon all &s;uch as commeth for reliefe vnto your luckely gates.</P>
<P>I thought it good, nece&s;&s;ary, and my bounden dutye to acquaynte your goodnes with the abhominable, wycked and dete&s;table behauor of all the&s;e row&s;ey, ragged rabblement of rakehelles, that vnder the pre&s;ence of great mi&s;ery, dy&s;ea&s;es and other innumerable calamites whiche they fayne through great hipocri&s;ye do wyn and gayne great aimes in all places where they wyly wander, to the vtter deludinge of the good geuers, deceauinge and impoueri&s;hing of all &s;uche poore hou&s;holders both &s;icke and &s;ore, as nether can or maye walke abroad for reliefe and comforte (where in dede mo&s;t mercy is to be &s;hewed.) And for that I (mo&s;t honorable Lady) beinge placed as a poore gen|tleman haue kepte a hou&s;e the&s;e twenty yeares, where vnto pouerty daylye hath and doth repayre, not without &s;ome releife as my poore callinge and habylytie maye and doth extende: I haue of late yeares gathered a great &s;u&s;pition that all &s;hould not be well, and as the pro+uerbe &s;aythe <HI>(&s;ome thinge lurke and laye hyd that dyd not playnely apeare)</HI> for I hauinge more occation throughe &s;ickenes to tarye and remayne at home, then I haue bene accu&s;tomed do by my there abyding, talke
<PB N="4" REF="3"> and confere dayly with many of the&s;e wyly-wanderars of both &s;orts as well men and wemen, as boyes and gyrles: by whom I haue ga|thered and vnder&s;tande, their depe di&s;&s;imulation and dete&s;table dea|lynge, beinge maruelous &s;uttle and craftye in there kynde, for not one among&s;t twentye wyll di&s;couer either declare there &s;celorus &s;e|crets: yet with fayre flatteringe wordes, money, and good chere, I haue attained to the typ by &s;uch as the meane&s;t of them hath wandred the&s;e xiii yeres and mo&s;t xvi, and &s;ome twenty and vpwarde, and not withoute faythfull prome&s;&s;e made vnto them neuer to di&s;couer their names or any thinge they &s;hewed me: for they woulde all &s;aye yf the vpright men &s;hould vnder&s;tand thereof they &s;hould not be onlye gre|uou&s;lye beaten, but put in danger of their lyues by the &s;ayde vpright men. There was a fewe yeres &s;ince a &s;mall breefe &s;et forthe of &s;ome zelous man to his countrey of whom I knowe not, that made a lytle &s;hewe of there names and v&s;age, and gaue a glym&s;inge lyghte not &s;ufficient to per&s;wad of their peuy&s;he peltinge and pickinge practy|&s;es, but well worthy of pray&s;e. But (good madame) with no le&s;&s;e tra|uell then good wyll, I haue repayred and rygged the Shyp of know|ledge, and haue hoy&s;&s;ed vp the &s;ayles of good fortune, that &s;he maye &s;afelye pa&s;&s;e aboute and through all partes of this noble realme, and there make porte &s;ale of her wy&s;hed wares, to the confu&s;ion of their drow&s;eye demener, and vnlawfull languag, pylfring pycking, wily wanderinge, and lykinge lecherye, of all the&s;e rablement of ra&s;cales, that raunges about all the co&s;tes of the &s;ame. So that their vndecent dolefull dealing and excerable exer&s;ices, maye apere to all as it were in a gla&s;&s;e, that therby the Iu&s;ticers and Shr&eacute;eues may in their cer|cutes, be more vygelant to puni&s;he the&s;e malefactors, and the Cou~|&s;tables Bayliffes, and bo&s;holders &s;ettinge a&s;yde all feare, &s;louthe, &amp; pytie, maye be more circom&s;pecte in executing y^e charge geuen the~ by the afore&s;ayde Iu&s;ticers. Then wyll no more this ra&s;call rabbleme~t raunge about the countrey, then greater releife maye b&eacute;e &s;hewed to the pouertye of eche pary&s;he, then &s;hall we kepe our Hor&s;&s;es in oure pa&s;tures vn&s;tolen, then our lynnen clothes &s;hall and maye lye &s;afely one our hedges vntouched, then &s;hall wee not haue our clothes and lynnen hoked oute at oure wyndowes as well by daye as by nyght. Then &s;hall we not haue our how&s;es broken vp in y^e night, as of late one of my nyghtbors had and two great buckes of clothes &s;tolen out, and mo&s;t of the &s;ame fyne Lynnen. Then &s;hall wee &s;afely kepe oure pygges and poultrey from pylfringe. Then &s;hall we &s;urely pa&s;&s;e by
<PB N="5" REF="3"> the hyghe wayes leading to marketes and fayres vnharmed. Then &s;hall our Shoppes and bothes be vnpycked and &s;poyled. Then &s;hall the&s;e vncomly companies bee di&s;per&s;ed and &s;et to labour for their ly|uinge, or ha&s;tely hange for their demerites. Then &s;hall it incourag a great number of gentlemen and others &s;einge this &s;ecuritie, to &s;et vp hou&s;es and kepe ho&s;pitalyty in the countrey, too y^e comfort of their nighboures, releife of the poore, &amp; to the amendemet of the common-welth. Then &s;hall not &s;inne and wyckednes &s;o much abound among vs. Then wyll gods wrathe be much thee more pacified towards vs. Then &s;hall we not ta&s;te of &s;o many and &s;oundry plages, as now day+ly raygneth ouer vs. And then &s;hall this Famous Empyre, bee in more welth and better flory&s;he, to the ine&s;tymable ioye and comfort of the Quenes mo&s;te excellent maie&s;tye whome god of his infynyce goodnes to his great glory long and manye yeares make mo&s;te pro&s;|perou&s;ly to raygne ouer vs to the great Felycity of all the Peres and Nobles, and to the vn&s;peakable ioye releife and quietnes of mind of all her faythfull Commons and Subiectes. Nowe me thinketh I fe+lowe the&s;e peuy&s;he peruer&s;e and pe&s;tilence people begyne to freate, fume, &s;weare and &s;tare at this my booke, their lyfe being layd open and aparantly paynted out that their confu&s;ion and end draweth one a pace Where as in dede if it be well wayed it is &s;et forthe for their &s;ynguler profyt and commoditie, for the &s;ure &s;afegarde of their lyues here in this world, that they &s;horter not the &s;ame before their tyme, and that by their true labour and good lyfe, in the world to com they maye &s;aue their Soules, that Chry&s;t the &s;econde per&s;on in Trinitye hath &s;o derely bought with his mo&s;t precious bloud: &s;o that hereby I &s;hall do them more good the~ they could haue deui&s;ed for them &s;elues. For beholde their lyfe beinge &s;o manyfe&s;t wycked and &s;o aparantlye knowen, the honorable wyll abhore them. The wor&s;hipfull wyl re|iecte them, the yemen wyll &s;harpely tawnte them, The Hu&s;bande men vtterly defye them, The Laborynge men bluntly chyde them, The wemen w^t a loud reclamation wonder at them. And all Chyldre~ with clapping handes crye out at them, I many tymes mu&s;inge with my &s;elfe at the&s;e my&s;cheuous mi&s;liuers merueled whe~ they toke their oryginall and begynning, howe longe they haue exerci&s;ed their exe|crable wandring a bout. I thought it meete to confere with a verye olde man that I was well acquaynted with, who&s;e wit and memory is meruelous for hys yeares, being about the age of foure&s;core, what he knew when he was yong of the&s;e lou&s;ey leuterars. And he &s;hewed
<PB N="6" REF="4"> me that when he was yong, he wayted vpon a man of much wor&s;hip in Kent, who died immediatly after the la&s;te Duke of Buckingham was beheaded, at his buryall there was &s;uche a number of beggers be&s;ides poore hou&s;holders dwellinge there aboutes that vnneth they myghtly or &s;tand about the Hou&s;e: then was there prepared for them a great and a large barne, and a great far ore &s;od out in Furmentye for them, with bread and drinke aboundantly to furne&s;h out the pre|mi&s;&s;es, and euery per&s;on had two pence for &s;uch was the dole. When Night approched y^e poore hou&s;holders repaired home to their hou&s;es, the other wayfaring bolde beggers remayned all night in the barne, and the &s;ame barne beinge &s;erched with light in the night by this old man and then yonge, with others, they tolde &s;euen &s;core per&s;ones of men, euery of them hauinge his woman, except it were two wemen that lay alone to gether for &s;ome e&s;pecyall cau&s;e. Thus hauing their makes to make mery with all, the buryall was turnede to bou&s;ynge and belly chere, morning to myrthe, fa&s;tinge to fea&s;tinge, prayer to pa&s;tyme, and pre&s;&s;inge of papes, and lamenting to Lechery. So that it maye apere this vncomly company hath had a longe continuance, but then nothinge geuen &s;o much to pylferinge, pyckinge and &s;poy|linge, and as far as I can learne or vnder&s;tand by the examination of a nomber of them, their languag, which they terme peddelars Fren|che or cantig began but w^tin the&s;e .xxx. yeres lytle aboue, and y^t the fir&s;t inuenter therof was hanged, all &s;aue the heade, for that is the fynall end of them all, or els to dye of &s;ome filthy and horible di&s;ea&s;es: but much harme is don in the means &s;pace by their continuance, as &s;ome x. xii. and xvi yeres before they be con&s;ented, and the nomber of them doth dayly renew. I hope their &s;ynne is now at y^e highe&s;t, and that as &s;hort and as &s;pedy a redres wyl be for the&s;e, as hath bene of late yeres for the wretched, wily wanderinge vagabondes, calling and naming them&s;elves Egiptians, depely di&s;&s;emblings and longe hydinge and coueringe their de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">pe deceitfull practi&s;es, fedinge the rude common people wholy addicted and geuen to nouelites, ioyes, and newe iu|uentions, delytinge them with the &s;trangenes of the attyre of their heades, and practi&s;inge paumi&s;trie to &s;uche as woulde knowe their fortunes. And to be &s;hort all theues and hores, as I may well wryt, as &s;ome haue had true experience, a nomber can well wytnes, and a great &s;ort hath woll felte it. And now (thankes bee to god) throughe whol&s;ome lawes and the due execution thereof, all be di&s;per&s;ed, va|ni&s;hed, &amp; the memory of then cleane extynguy&s;hed, that when they
<PB N="7" REF="4"> bee once named hereafter, our Chyldren wyll muche maruell what kynde of people they were: and &s;o I tru&s;t &s;hal &s;hortly happen of the&s;e. For what thinge doth chiefly cau&s;e the&s;e row&s;eye rake helles thus to continue and dayly increa&s;e? &s;urely a nomber of wycked par&s;ons that keepe typlyng Hou&s;es in all theres, where they haue &s;uccour and re|liefe, and what &s;o euer they bryng they are &s;ure to receaue money for the &s;ame, for they &s;ell good penyworthes. The byers haue y^e greate&s;t gayne, yea yf they haue nether money nor ware they wylbe tru&s;ted, their credite is much. I haue taken a note of a good manye of them &amp; wyl&s;end their names and dwelling places to &s;uch In&s;tecers as dwel|leth nere or next vnto them, that they by their good wi&s;edomes maye di&s;place the &s;ame, and auctory&s;e &s;uch, as haue hone&s;ty. I wyl not blot my boke with their names, becau&s;e they be re&s;ident. But as for this fletinge Fellow&s;hyp I haue truly &s;etforth the mo&s;t part of them that be doers at this pre&s;ente with their names that they be knowene by. Al&s;o I haue placed in the end thereof their leud langage callinge the &s;ame pedlers Frenche or canting. And how &s;hall I end my prologe, makinge true declaration (right honorable Lady) as they &s;hall fall in order of their vntymelye tryfelinge time, leud lyfe, and pernitious practi&s;es, tru&s;tinge that the &s;ame &s;hall neyther trouble or aba&s;h your mo&s;t tender, tymerous and pytifull Nature, to thinke y^e &s;mall m&eacute;ede &s;hould growe vnto you for &s;uch Almes &s;o geuen. For god our marci|full and mo&s;t louinge father well knoweth your hartes and good in|tent, the geuer neuer wanteth his reward, accordinge to the &s;aying of Saynt Augu&s;tyn: as there is (neyther &s;halbe) any &s;ynne vnpuni&s;|&s;hed, euen &s;o &s;hall there not be eny good dede vnrewarded. But how comfortably &s;peketh Chry&s;t our Sauiour vnto as in his go&s;pel (geue ye and it &s;halbe geuen you agayne) behold farther, good Madam that for a cup of colde water, Chry&s;t hath promi&s;ed a good reward. Now &s;aynt Au&s;ten properly declareth why Chry&s;t &s;peaketh of cold water, becau&s;e the poore&s;t man that is, &s;hall not excu&s;e him &s;elfe from that cherytable warke lea&s;t he would paraduenture &s;aye that he hath ne|ther wood, poot nor pan to warme any water with. Se farther what god &s;peaketh in the mouth of his prophete E&s;aye, breake thy bread to him that is a hongred, he &s;ayth not geue him a hole lo&s;e: for parad|uenture the poore man hath it not to geue, then let him geue a pece.

And with &s;tout Ada&s;cite, demaundeth where he thinketh hee maye bee bold, and circom&s;pecte ynough as he &s;ethe cau&s;e to a&s;ke charitie, rufully and lamentably, that it would make a flyntey hart to relent. and pitye his mi&s;erable e&s;tate, howe he hath bene maymed and brou|&s;ed in the warres, &amp; parauenture &s;ome wyll &s;hew you &s;ome outward wounde, whiche he gotte at &s;ome dronken fraye, eyther haltynge of &s;ome preuye wounde fe&s;tred with a fylthy firy flankard. For be well a&s;&s;ured that the hardi&s;t &s;ouldiers be eyther &s;layne or maymed, eyther and they e&s;cape all ha&s;&s;ardes, and retourne home agayne, if they bee without reliefe of their friends, they wyll &s;urely de&s;peratly robbe, and &s;teale, and eyther &s;hortlye be hanged or mi&s;erablye dye in pry&s;on, for they be &s;o much a&s;hamed and di&s;dayne to beg or a&s;ke charity, that ra|ther they wyll as de&s;peratly fight for to lyue &amp; mayntayn them &s;elues as manfully, and valyantly, they ventered them &s;elues in y^e Prynces quarell.
