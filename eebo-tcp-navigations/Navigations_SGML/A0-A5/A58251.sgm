<HEAD>REASONS Humbly offered again&s;t GRAFTING or SPLICING, And for Di&s;&s;olving this <HI>Pre&s;ent Ea&s;t-India Company,</HI> OR, JOINT-STOCK: And ERECTING and ESTABLISHING A NEW <HI>National Joint-Stock or Company.</HI> More Exten&s;ive and Univer&s;al, on a better Con&s;titution and Terms of Settlement.</HEAD>
<P>Fir&s;t, _THis pre&s;ent Company or Joynt-Stock is only an <HI>imagi|nary Fund,</HI> not having any <HI>real Stock</HI> of its own left to carry on the Trade, according to the general Judg|ment of all that have Knowledge, and are mo&s;t in|tuitous in that Affair, as al&s;o of many the concerned, and &s;o can upon no Account be conceived a &s;uitable Foundation to <HI>build</HI> or <HI>graft</HI> &s;o large and <HI>National a Trade</HI> upon.</P>
<P>Nor will it &s;uit with the Wi&s;dom of Per&s;ons ver&s;ed in Trade to join Stocks with any in a hazardous, low, weak, bankrupt Condition, having but a bare <HI>nominal Stock.</HI></P>
<P>Nor will it be agreeable with the Fore&s;ight and Prudence of &s;o Serene and Augu&s;t an A&s;&s;embly as the <HI>Honorable Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> to entru&s;t &s;o va&s;t a Trade in the hands of &s;uch as have <HI>no Stock</HI> therein, and permit them to reap the whole or chief benefit thereof.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2">
<P>And it would &s;eem injurious to the re&s;t of the Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> that tho&s;e that have had the benefit thereof &s;o long, and have received all (if not much more than all) their real principal Stock out by Dividends, &s;hould yet have the &s;ame benefit continued to them on account of an <HI>imaginary Stock,</HI> to the excluding and depriving all the re&s;t of the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> who de&s;ire to partake thereof according to their Birthright.</P>
<P>Nor is it the effect of Mode&s;ty, Ingenuity, or Publick Spiritedne&s;s, but the direct contrary, in any, to de&s;ire or propo&s;e any &s;uch Project.</P>
<P>That this pre&s;ent Company is in &s;o bad and mean a Condition, may be concluded from &s;everal Topicks; as, by their &s;tudious Endeavours to con|ceal the true State of their Stock, as &s;eems manife&s;t by that <HI>dark, general, un|mercantile Account</HI> they lately gave in to the <HI>Honorable Committee of Parliament;</HI> to whom, in re&s;pect of their Kindne&s;s and Patience to them (if Autho|rity had no &s;way) they might have given one more candid; and proba|bly they had if their State would have admitted of a more clear and parti|cular In&s;pect: for tho it were &s;o that they want three or four Years Books from <HI>India</HI> (which by the way is an impardonable Crime, and renders their Servants worthy of &s;evere Ca&s;tigation, and not &s;uch high Encomiums gi|ven them unle&s;s it were by direction) yet they might have produced a more <HI>fair, clear, particular, &s;atisfying Account,</HI> if &s;o it had plea&s;ed them; for had they brought in the Balance of their la&s;t Books from <HI>India,</HI> with an Ac|count of what quick Stock hath been &s;ent out, and Goods received thence &s;ince, and their Debts and quick Stock here, &s;ome Computation might have been made, &s;omewhat more or le&s;s; and that it hath been omitted argues <HI>all is not right.</HI></P>
<P>But admitting the Account as given in, by which they would have it believed they have much about the Sum of 700000 <HI>l.</HI> yet thence being de|ducted the &s;everal Sums and Articles omitted to be mentioned in the &s;aid Account, and what is over-rated therein in their own favour, being truly valued, their Stock will not be found to be other than <HI>merely imaginary,</HI> if not <HI>va&s;tly behind-hand</HI> (which if &s;o, Ju&s;tice will require of the Adventurers) as for in&s;tance;</P>

<ITEM>Satisfaction to the Nation and State for all the Wrongs, Abu|&s;es to the Subject, a&s;&s;uming <HI>De&s;potick Power, and Sovereign Authority,</HI> and exerci&s;ing the &s;ame in Captures, Violences, Rapines, Piracies, Murthers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 500000 <HI>l.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>If any be aggrieved at the la&s;t Article, let him con&s;ider what Sums were laid upon a World of People in the la&s;t Reigns upon Actions between Sub|ject and Subject for Trifles, meer Words, &s;ome perhaps only imaginary, as in the Ca&s;e of the pre&s;ent Lord Mayor Sir <HI>Thomas Pilkinton,</HI> Doctor <HI>Oates,</HI> Sir <HI>Trevor Williams,</HI> Mr. <HI>Arnold,</HI> Mr. <HI>Colt</HI> and others; and many upon In|dictments of the State, as Sir <HI>Samuel Barnardi&s;ton,</HI> Sir <HI>William Williams,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hambden,</HI> Mr. <HI>Sacheverel</HI> and the <HI>Guild-Hall Rioters, &amp;c.</HI> (who&s;e ble&s;&s;ed fortune it was, that the Appellation of <HI>Rebels</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Rioters</HI> was not blundered upon, but that Error was rectified with a witne&s;s upon the poor <HI>S. Helenians</HI>) and then this Sum, how bulky &s;oever it may look at fir&s;t &s;ight will doubtle&s;s be judged a very moderate calculation even by the Company them&s;elves; more e&s;pecially if any of the Members thereof have been &s;o &s;e|vere, and had the con&s;cience upon &s;uch &s;light matters to accept of Verdicts for &s;uch <HI>va&s;t Sums,</HI> on their private account, as the Defendants were no way able to pay, and to take out Execution, and lay them in Jayl for their lives; the&s;e &s;ure with their Friends and Adherents, of all others, cannot think much of paying their Quota of the above-mentioned Sum, or a greater, which, as de&s;igned, may deter others from committing the like for the fu|ture, and be a help and ea&s;e to the Nation in reducing <HI>Ireland,</HI> and extirpating <HI>Arbitrary Government.</HI></P>
<P>Now if after the&s;e Rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for this Fine, the Age &s;hould yet be &s;o prodigally merciful, as to pardon or mitigate it, the Company will notwith|&s;tanding &s;till appear to be in a very ill plight.</P>
<P>And as it was no mean Affrontery to the Nation, &s;o it brought a di&s;mal Cloud upon the Reputation of the Stock, rendering it more than &s;u&s;pected; that the Company at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on, under high Accu&s;ations, and upon Inqui|&s;ition thereinto by Parliament, &s;hould unrea&s;onably make a Dividend, as was done lately of 50 <HI>per Cent.</HI> (which is the entire fir&s;t principal Stock) whenas they had not at the &s;ame time Money enough in <HI>England</HI> to pay it; what could be the meaning hereof? but that they de&s;igned to draw out
<PB N="4" REF="3" MS="y">their whole Stock and much more, and &s;o to leave an <HI>empty Bag,</HI> and a <HI>great Demand</HI> to embara&s;s the Nation; and 'tis the Opinion of all, that, if not prevented, they will upon the next Sale make another Dividend, for they have refu&s;ed to accept thereupon of any Debentures or Bonds owing by them, as u&s;ual, but to have all ready Money.</P>
<P>Secondly, This pre&s;ent Company, or Joint-Stock is of very <HI>ill Fame,</HI> as an <HI>illegal, rank, bitter Stock,</HI> &s;uch as no hone&s;t Man can or dare join with, or graft up|on; being founded and planted in a direct oppo&s;ition to the <HI>Native Liberty</HI> of the Subject; cultivated, cheri&s;hed and influenced by the Hand of Tyranny and and arbitrary Power, watered with the Tears, Groans, and E&s;tates of the Sub|jects of <HI>England,</HI> and hath grown up to an unbounded <HI>De&s;potick Power,</HI> a&s;&s;uming to it &s;elf, and a&s;piring to by others, an <HI>unhoopable Power</HI> over Goods, Liber|ties, and Properties of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men at plea&s;ure, and exerted the &s;ame to the great intangling the pre&s;ent Stock, occa&s;ioning va&s;t Demands, Suits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And &s;hould any join with, or graft upon &s;uch a <HI>Stock</HI> what Ble&s;&s;ing what Suc|ce&s;s can be expected? but that all &s;hould be cur&s;ed; it would be like the plowing with an Ox and an A&s;s; and abhorring, or &s;owing divers &s;eeds to the polluting the Harve&s;t.</P>
<P>Thirdly, This pre&s;ent Company, or Joint-Stock is under a much greater <HI>Obloquy,</HI> as guilty of the wor&s;t of Crimes, the mo&s;t infamous Impieties, not only great Rapines and Oppre&s;&s;ions, but of <HI>Notorious, Cruel, Bloody Murthers;</HI> either to &s;atisfie their own &s;avage barbarous Tempers, or to comply with a de&s;ignedly en&s;laving Court. The&s;e are they that have &s;hed the Blood of War in Peace, and to continue and graft upon &s;uch a Stock will endanger a parti|cipation of the &s;ame Guilt, Condemnation and Puni&s;hment, and &s;eem too much to ju&s;tifie what hath been done, tho ju&s;tly to be abhorred by all, and harden and encourage to a further reiterated Commi&s;&s;ion of the like in the future; whereas it rather &s;eems the Duty of all Men of Sen&s;e, Honor and Con&s;cience, &s;o to dete&s;t &s;uch a <HI>Stock</HI> for, and on account of &s;uch flagitious Crimes, as to endeavour an utter extirpation of the very memory of them, a total oblivion of them being the greate&s;t kindne&s;s can be &s;hewn them, and the be&s;t Tomb&s;tone that can be laid upon them; and in truth how &s;hall &s;uch an <HI>Obloquy</HI> be wiped away but by an entire Di&s;&s;olution of them?</P>
<P>Fourthly, This pre&s;ent Company, or Joint-Stock, is not only guilty of tho&s;e vile infamous Acts beforementioned, but as the &s;ad provoking Aggra|vation thereof have perpetrated many of them in the &s;ight of the Sun, under the hypocritical Di&s;gui&s;e of Ju&s;tice declaring their Sin as <HI>Sodom,</HI> not being a|&s;hamed thereof, glorying therein, in&s;tead of coming upon their Knees, ac|knowledging their Guilt, giving Glory to God by Confe&s;&s;ion and Repentance, (if peradventure Remi&s;&s;ion may be granted them by a merciful and ju&s;t God) and &s;atisfaction to man for Injuries done them, they have offered in the pride and arrogancy of their hearts to ju&s;tifie the &s;ame at the Bar of the Ho|norable Hou&s;e, and endeavour'd by ba&s;e indirect means to &s;tifle and take off the Evidence, and &s;till continue in the &s;ame humor, as appears in their Nar|rative, and &s;eem not all &s;en&s;ible of their impious Acts, more than of the
<PB N="5" REF="3">Puni&s;hment that threatens them, being <HI>Pharaoh</HI> like, as it &s;hould &s;eem, ju|dicially hardened, pa&s;t repentance, never to be convinced, never to be con|verted, but become dete&s;table to God and man; to man for injuries done them, to God for their riveted impenitency; therefore by no means to be <HI>continued, grafted</HI> on, or <HI>clouted,</HI> but as pa&s;t all hopes <HI>(Ne pars &s;incera tra|hatur)</HI> there remains only the la&s;t remedy, an <HI>utter Di&s;&s;olution</HI> of them. <HI>Amen, Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly, This pre&s;ent Company, or Joint-Stock <HI>continued,</HI> and <HI>grafted</HI> on, will not con&s;i&s;t with the <HI>Honor and Ju&s;tice of the Nation,</HI> who in their Re|pre&s;entatives, upon a full hearing at their Bar, and &s;erious Debate thereon, have voted them guilty of no le&s;s than <HI>murthering the Subjects of</HI> England. And who can have the confidence to de&s;ire the Continuance of, or the Folly to join with &s;uch a Society? And what a Reflection will it be to have the &s;ame Society e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Nation? It hath been a common Ob&s;erva|tion, that &s;uch as the Hou&s;e of Commons have at any time &s;hewed their Di&s;like of, charged or impeached, what Intere&s;t &s;oever they might have had before in the Nation's E&s;teem, and what methods &s;oever they may have u&s;ed to keep up, or regain their Credit; yet tho they may have &s;ecured them&s;elves in their Stations, and continue their <HI>Ne&s;ts on high,</HI> yet they never regain the favor and good will of the People, or Nation: nor is there any Love ever lo&s;t on the other &s;ide, it rarely happening, but that &s;uch Per&s;ons or Societies ever after prove bitter Enemies to a Free Hou&s;e of Commons. In&s;tances hereof many might be given, but the Living &s;hall be &s;pared, and the Dead covered; and will the Commons of <HI>England,</HI> after &s;uch a Vote, ever have any thoughts of con&s;tituting them a ruling Corporation? What might then be expected but reacting the &s;ame Mi&s;chiefs with a greater malice, as always hath been in &s;uch Ca&s;es; but let never &s;uch a thing be &s;aid of our <HI>Healers and Re&s;torers,</HI> but let their Votes proceed to Judgment; and the lowe&s;t piece of Ju&s;tice that can be inflicted on them, the &s;malle&s;t Attonement that can be made to the Honor and Ju&s;tice of the Nation, is a di&s;enabling them to act the &s;ame over again, which can be by no other means than di&s;charging them their Office, which is di&s;&s;olving of them.</P>
<P>Sixthly, This pre&s;ent Company, or Joint-Stock grafted on, will be a great hazard and in&s;ecurity to the Nation; the Trade of <HI>India</HI> is of va&s;t import to the Kingdom, and is computed by &s;ome to amount to an eighth, by others a &s;ixth part of the Trade thereof; and the Power and Intere&s;t, e&s;pecially Naval, of &s;uch a Company, will be exceeding great, which according to the grafting Model will terminate and re&s;olve into the &s;ame Hands it is in at pre&s;ent, and hath been for &s;ome time; and what &s;ort of Men the&s;e are for Principles and Practices their own Acts have &s;ounded forth to the whole World, as well in what hath been performed under the Conduct of this Society, as otherwhere. This very Society was of the fir&s;t that made Addre&s;&s;es to the late King, with a promi&s;e of &s;lavi&s;h complyance to that illegal arbitrary demand of continuing the Cu&s;toms then expired, to the encouraging and &s;etting up of <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Tyranny,</HI> and was a leading Card to the re&s;t of the le&s;&s;er Companies, and
<PB N="6" REF="4">particular Merchants to a tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to that Badge of Slavery, <HI>Rai&s;ing Money by Proclamations,</HI> and of this Action they publickly and highly boa&s;ted, va|luing them&s;elves mightily thereon. But how much favour and re&s;pect they or their Introducers de&s;erve of the Nation on that account, is &s;oon ca&s;t up: and more particularly divers of them have declared them&s;elves, upon all Accounts, Friends to <HI>Arbitrary Power</HI> and <HI>Tyranny,</HI> and have been <HI>paltry Tools of State</HI> in the late Reigns. To whom do we owe the grand Inva&s;ion of our Liberties and Properties, the fatal Violation of the Privileges and Rights of this great City, and all the direful unble&s;s'd Con&s;equences that &s;ucceeded, but to &s;ome of the <HI>prime Adventurers</HI> and <HI>Managers</HI> among&s;t them, who have &s;ignalized their Zeal to a Government, in Church and State, neither agreeable to the Laws of our Land, Good and Liberty of the Subject, or to the pure unde|filed Prote&s;tant Religion. And will the Wi&s;dom of the Nation think fit to put &s;o great a Power and Intere&s;t into the Hands of the late King's Tools? How great mi&s;chiefs might thence ari&s;e to the Nation on &s;undry Accounts, is better to be imagined, and provided again&s;t, than tryed and felt; therefore may there be no <HI>Grafting,</HI> but a <HI>Di&s;&s;olution,</HI> which infallibly &s;ecures us in that re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Seventhly, This pre&s;ent Company, or Joint-Stock grafted upon, will no ways an&s;wer the <HI>End</HI> de&s;igned of making the Trade, or Management thereof more <HI>Diffu&s;ive</HI> and <HI>National,</HI> according to the Con&s;titution of this Kingdom, and Native Right and Liberty of the People, but will &s;till be a &s;ore <HI>Mo|nopoly</HI> to the great Grievance of the Subject. The Propo&s;al of Enlargement being only to one Million, and the old Stock being calculated (tho not really worth one Groat) to amount to three parts of four of it, the new to be joined thereto, it follows, mu&s;t amount to no more than a fourth part of the whole, or a third part of the pre&s;ent <HI>Nominal Stock:</HI> &s;o that the old Adven|tures will be three to one before any new Sub&s;criptions, and mo&s;t probably four or five to one after Sub&s;criptions; for their own engro&s;&s;ing policy will oblige them to &s;ub&s;cribe largely to keep it in their own Hands; and then what &s;ort of Enlargement or Grafting will this be? What con&s;iderable part of the Nation will have room to come in? And what kind of per&s;ons mu&s;t tho&s;e few be, &s;eeing it will not be the Intere&s;t of either wi&s;e politick men, nor of hone&s;t good men to engage, &s;o that it will nece&s;&s;arily remain in the hands of the &s;ame arbitrary per&s;ons it's now already in, and this <HI>Grafting</HI> or <HI>Splicing</HI> will make no Alteration in the Management neither; for as they have projected the Bu&s;ine&s;s by the <HI>ten Votes,</HI> which is the &s;ame in this re&s;pect, as two hundred, tho they &s;hould be all new Men chat come in and graft, yet they can make no Balance with the old ones, no, not to make one Com|mittee-Man; therefore, of cour&s;e, it mu&s;t fall into the hands of the &s;ame nu|merical per&s;ons, and having the &s;ame Managers there will be the &s;ame Fruits, and &s;o continue, as hitherto it hath been, an <HI>intolerable Burthen,</HI> an <HI>un&s;upportable Yoke</HI> of Iron, under which the whole Nation complains and groans, and have their Eyes fixed upon the Parliament for redre&s;s, before whom the Ca&s;e is &s;pread.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="4">
<P>Eighthly, The pre&s;ent Company, or Joint-Stock have enjoyed this Trade of <HI>India</HI> &s;olely to them&s;elves, exclu&s;ive to all others, in a <HI>Monopoly</HI> upward of thirty years, to their va&s;t advantage; and &s;urely &s;uch have no rea&s;on to complain of Inju&s;tice, or any hard u&s;age, if the Nation &s;hould after their &s;o long an Enjoyment re&s;ume the Trade into its own Hands, and di&s;&s;olve their Society, more e&s;pecially &s;eeing they may all come in, and partake of the New Joint-Stock in a National Way by becoming Sub&s;cribers thereto.</P>
<P>Ninthly, The di&s;&s;olving this pre&s;ent Company, or Joint-Stock, and e|recting a new one, is the mo&s;t likely, probable, ready way to retrieve our lo&s;t decayed Trade of <HI>India,</HI> and procure and &s;ettle a firm la&s;ting Peace on good Terms with the <HI>Indians.</HI> What Peace will they grant or keep &s;o long as tho&s;e that have been the Cau&s;es and Executors of all the Mi&s;chiefs that have befallen, be continued in power? Or what a&s;&s;urance can they have of tho&s;e that have broken all Faith and good Manners with them.</P>
<P>Tenthly, The Di&s;&s;olution of this pre&s;ent Company, or Joint-Stock, and E&s;tabli&s;hing a new National One, will greatly enlighten the Nation, and make no mean Di&s;covery of hidden Works of Darkne&s;s, u&s;eful to be known to the publick; the grand Di&s;pute of the Greatne&s;s of their Stock will then be at an end, all will appear manife&s;t and open. If it prove as they &s;ay, the Be|nefit will be their own; but if otherwi&s;e, the People will be undeceived, and &s;ee what Impo&s;als they have been under, and what Dangers they are delivered from; the whole Intrigue of the Management will be made apparent, how they have complyed with, and crouched to an in&s;laving Court, to e&s;tabli&s;h in them&s;elves a <HI>De&s;potick Power,</HI> only to &s;atisfie their own corrupt inclinations, help forward, &s;ettle and bind on the Subject of <HI>England</HI> a <HI>Court de&s;igned Ty|ranny,</HI> and many other <HI>Ne&s;ts of Villany,</HI> which then will not any longer be concealed.</P>
<P>Eleventhly, The di&s;&s;olving this pre&s;ent Company, or Joint-Stock, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a new National One, will much tend, be a great help, and go far towards a full entire Settlement of the Nation, it being a Concern of &s;uch extent, as an eighth or &s;ixth part of the Foreign Trade of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Twelfthly, The di&s;&s;olving this pre&s;ent Joint-Stock, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a new National One, is that which agrees and falls in with the Genius of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the Nation at this Day; and in publick Refor|mations it hath generally &s;eemed expedient, to the Wi&s;dom of Parliaments, to proceed in, and take &s;uch Methods as are mo&s;t agreeable to the Con&s;ti|tution of the Nation, the Laws of the Land, Right of the Subject, and con&s;o|nant to the Bent and Spirit of the be&s;t and mo&s;t thinking part of the People, which &s;eems ab&s;olutely again&s;t confirming any <HI>illegal,</HI> or <HI>grafting, clouting, patching, &s;plicing</HI> any <HI>weak, doubted, failing, drooping, <HI>Nominal</HI> Stock,</HI> but wholly for a <HI>Bran-New One,</HI> erected by new Sub&s;criptions, e&s;tabli&s;hed and &s;ettled by Parliament upon &s;uch a Ba&s;is and Con&s;titution as may make it mo&s;t Nationally exten&s;ive, according to the Birthright of the Subject, and mo&s;t &s;uitable and advantageous for the &s;aid Commerce.</P>

<P>Much more might be added upon this Subject; but what is already offered, if well weighed, is conceived, will fully evince what was undertaken; and therefore to &s;um up all, &s;eeing the pre&s;ent Company appears to have only an <HI>imaginary Stock</HI> for the carrying on the Trade, and that its Con&s;titution is <HI>il|legal</HI> and <HI>pernicious,</HI> founded on <HI>Arbitrary Power,</HI> and accordingly have acted &s;o, as to bring them&s;elves under di&s;mal <HI>Obloquies</HI> by <HI>unlawful Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,</HI> and <HI>girding</HI> them&s;elves with the <HI>Blood of the Subject,</HI> without any <HI>remor&s;e,</HI> ready to act the &s;ame over again, tho under the Judgment of the Nation con|demned by the Hou&s;e of Commons, therefore never to be tru&s;ted more; &s;o that it will neither con&s;i&s;t with the <HI>Ju&s;tice, Honor</HI> or <HI>Security</HI> of the Nation to have this Company continued, nor the <HI>Wi&s;dom, Hone&s;ty, Integrity, Genius</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of any true <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men to <HI>graft</HI> thereon, &s;eeing it can make no Altera|tion in its Con&s;titution, Management or Managers, nor any ways wipe off that Obloquy it lies under in the &s;ight of the Nation. Therefore it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">s nece&s;&s;ary it be di&s;&s;olved, being its Di&s;&s;olution is no injury to the concerned, they ha|ving enjoyed the &s;ame, to the Nations damage, thirty years, and upward, and it being the mo&s;t probable means of re&s;toring the Trade, and &s;ettling a firm la&s;ting Peace with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and is that which will bring to light many hidden Works of Darkne&s;s, to the Satisfaction, as well as Benefit of the Subject, tend much to the &s;ettling the Nation, is &s;uitable to the Laws of the Land, Liberty of the Subject, and to the pre&s;ent Inclination of the &s;o|ber con&s;iderable part of the People. Surely none that have any love for their Country, and can prefer a va&s;t la&s;ting National publick Utility and Advan|tage, but mu&s;t ab&s;olutely conclude again&s;t <HI>Graftings,</HI> and entirely for di&s;&s;ol|ving this pre&s;ent Company, and erecting and e&s;tabli&s;hing a new National Joint-Stock, more Exten&s;ive and Univer&s;al, on a better Con&s;titution and Terms of Settlement. Which is the earne&s;t De&s;ire of all true hearted <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men; and the &s;ole De&s;ign of this Paper.</P>
