Some of the Noble&s;s keep a thou&s;and Hor&s;e; none, though never &s;o poor, but keep two or three; and Beggars there mounted crave Alms and Charity of the People. When they remove their Habitations, their Hor&s;es carry their Provi&s;ions and Tents: If Provi&s;ions grow &s;hort, they eat Mares Milk, high gu&s;ted with Garlick, which &s;atisfies Hunger and Thir&s;t; and the red Liquor which they tap warm from their Veins, &s;erves them to help Dige&s;tion, and heighten their Humor, in&s;tead of the Blood of the Grape, our &s;weet Wine.

When a Per|&s;on of Quality prepares to cro&s;s any River, they tie two Hor&s;es Tail to Tail, and athwart both their Backs fa&s;ten a Mat pleited of Ru&s;hes, to &s;it on.

But he little ob&s;erv'd his Orders, and what he was commanded; for Sailing into the Haven <HI>Curiana,</HI> he barter'd Shells, Needles, Gla&s;s, and &s;uch like Trifles, for abundance of Pearls, which the I&s;landers brought aboard, for he him&s;elf having but thirty Men, dur&s;t not ven|ture a&s;hore. Twenty days this bartering Trade continued, Orient Pearls for Toys;<NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cription of <HI>Curiana.</HI></NOTE> but finding at la&s;t, that they were a civil and ho&s;pitable People, he Landed, where they entertain'd him in Hovels built of Wood, and cover'd with Palm-Leaves; before their Doors lay great Hills of Oy&s;ter-&s;hells, the Fi&s;h being eaten, and the Pearls us'd for an ornament ; Conies, Hares, Phea|&s;ants, Pigeons, Gee&s;e, Ducks, Deer, and wild Swine, are their u&s;ual Food; and their Bread is made of the Roots of Trees. Moreover, <HI>Curiana</HI> abounds with thick and &s;hady Woods, which re&s;ound in the night with the cries and roar|ings of wild Bea&s;ts: but though they are terrible fierce and voracious, yet the Natives &s;toutly venture in among&s;t the thicke&s;t of them, arm'd onely with Bowes and Arrows. The Inhabitants are of Complexion tawny, their Hair long and curl'd; their Teeth they keep white with an Herb, which they con|tinually hold betwixt their Lips. The Women perform their bu&s;ine&s;s of Husbandry, Ploughing and Sowing. The Men are Soldiers, following the bu&s;ine&s;s of War: but in Peace their Exerci&s;es are Hunting and Dancing. They keep annual Fairs, where from all Parts of the Countrey they bring their Commodities to buy and barter. They have their Gold from <HI>Cauchieta,</HI> &s;ix days Sail We&s;tward from <HI>Curiana.</HI></P>

<P>The&s;e People, though &s;o civil, are extreamly jealous of their Wives: for when a <HI>Spaniard</HI> made addre&s;s to one of them, and coming &s;omething clo&s;e, her Husband &s;tept in &s;uddenly between, and &s;eem'd to forbid the Banns.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;etling of Plantations.</NOTE>This Countrey, whether fir&s;t di&s;cover'd by the &s;aid <HI>Verrazanus,</HI> or together with the re&s;t of largely-taken <HI>Virginia,</HI> by Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> or, as &s;ome &s;ay, by Captain <HI>Go&s;nald,</HI> in the Year 1602. was &s;o well known to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the be|ginning of King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign here, that the &s;etling and carrying on of Plantations id this part of <HI>America,</HI> was vigorou&s;ly promoted by many of the mo&s;t eminent Per|&s;ons in <HI>England:</HI> whereupon it was about the Year 1606. being the fourth Year of the &s;aid King, granted by Patent to &s;everal Lords, Knights, Gentlemen and Mer|chants, under the denomination of <HI>The Plymouth Company,</HI> both in favour of tho&s;e generous Spirits, who &s;tudied and endeavor'd the good of the Publick by foreign Plantations, and indulgence to tho&s;e, who not well &s;atisfi'd with the Government of Church and State, and willingly tran&s;porting them&s;elves and Families thither, as to their <HI>A&s;ylum,</HI> could more conveniently be &s;par'd than the better affected part of the People: And although the Colonies at fir&s;t &s;ent over &s;ucceeded not accord|ing to expectation, yet in a &s;hort time there Plantations were brought to very great perfection. Captain <HI>Weimouth,</HI> who had been employ'd there by the Lord <HI>Arundel</HI> of <HI>Warder,</HI> for the di&s;covery of the North-We&s;t Pa&s;&s;age, falling &s;hort of his Cour&s;e, hapned into a River on the Coa&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> call'd <HI>Pemmaquid;</HI> from whence he brought five of the Natives for <HI>England,</HI> three of who&s;e Names were <HI>Mannida&punc; Skettwarroes,</HI> and <HI>Ta&s;quantum,</HI> and Landing at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> pre&s;ented them to Sir <HI>Ferdi|nando Gorges,</HI> whom he made u&s;e of as In&s;truments for the farther advancement of the&s;e Plantations: they were all of one Nation, but of &s;everal parts, and &s;everal Families; he kept them with him three years, and ob&s;erving in them an inclination to vertuous De&s;igns, and Spirits above the Vulgar, he gain'd information from
<PB N="141" REF="86">them what great Rivers ran up into the Land, what Men of note were &s;eated on them, what Power they were of, how Ally'd, what Enemies they had, and the like; and taking &s;ome light from thence, &s;ent away a Ship, furni&s;h'd with Men, and all kind of Nece&s;&s;aries convenient for the Service intended, under the Com|mand of Captain <HI>Henry Chaloung,</HI> a Gentleman of a good Family, and very capable for Undertakings of this nature; and giving him &s;ufficient In&s;tructions what to do, &s;ent along with him two of the &s;aid Natives for his better Conduct and Di|rection, ordering him by all means to keep the Northerly Gage as high as <HI>Cape Briton,</HI> till they had di&s;cover'd the Main, and then to beat it up to the Southward as the Coa&s;t tended, till they found by the Natives they were near the place to which they were a&s;&s;ign'd. By that time they were about a hundred Leagues off the I&s;land of <HI>Canara,</HI> the Captain fell &s;ick of a Feaver, and the Winds being We&s;terly, his Company &s;hap'd their Cour&s;e for the <HI>Indies,</HI> and coming to <HI>St. John de Porto Rico,</HI> the Captain went a&s;hore for the recovery of his Health, whil&s;t the Company took in Water, and &s;uch other Provi&s;ions as they had pre&s;ent need of, and &s;pent &s;ome time in Hunting, and other Recreations; after which &s;teering their intended Cour&s;e, they were met with by the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleet that came from the <HI>Havana,</HI> taken Pri&s;oners and carried into <HI>Spain,</HI> the Ship and Goods being confi&s;cated, the Voyage overthrown, and the Natives lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Not long after the &s;etting out of <HI>Chaloung, Thomas Haman</HI> was &s;ent by Sir <HI>John Popham,</HI> Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of <HI>England,</HI> towards the River of <HI>Sagadehoc,</HI> to the &s;uc|cour of <HI>Chaloung,</HI> if need were; but not finding him, after he had &s;cowr'd the Coa&s;t all about, he return'd back into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Captain <HI>Prinne</HI> was likewi&s;e &s;ent from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> who arriving happily in tho&s;e Parts, brought back with him at his return the mo&s;t exact Di&s;covery of that Coa&s;t that ever had been gain'd till then.</P>
<P>A while after, at the Charge of the &s;aid Sir <HI>John Popham,</HI> a hundred Men were &s;ent to &s;ettle a Colony at <HI>Sagadehoc,</HI> under the Command of <HI>George Popham, Raleigh Gilbert,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Ship, who &s;eated them&s;elves in a <HI>Penin&s;ula,</HI> at the Mouth of this River; which attempting to di&s;cover, they met with a Wood near to an I&s;land, di&s;tant from the Line about forty five Degrees, and &s;ome odd Seconds, where they ea&s;ily went on Shore. In the Year 1608. the Commander of the Colony decea&s;ing, and not long after him the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, who had been the chief that had furni&s;h'd them with fre&s;h Supplies, they return'd for <HI>England</HI> in tho&s;e Ships that had been &s;ent them with Succours: At which unexpected return, the Patrons of the De&s;ign were &s;o offended, that for a certain time they de&s;i&s;ted from their Enterprizes.

<P>Suddenly after Captain <HI>Hob&s;on</HI> and divers others were &s;et out with very great Preparations, and with them two of the Natives which had been detain'd for &s;ome time in <HI>England,</HI> whom they thought to have made u&s;e of, the better to draw the re&s;t of the Natives to their Commerce; but becau&s;e a little before twenty four of them had been treacherou&s;ly dealt with by one <HI>Hunt,</HI> they contracted from thence &s;o great an animo&s;ity towards the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that Captain <HI>Hob&s;on</HI> was con|&s;train'd to return without effecting any thing.</P>
<P>In the Year 1614. Captain <HI>John Smith</HI> being &s;ent to Fi&s;h for Whales, and &s;eek af|ter Mines of Gold and Silver, Landed upon the I&s;land of <HI>Monahiggan,</HI> where he found &s;ome &s;tore of Whales, but not &s;uch as tho&s;e by who&s;e Oyl they u&s;e to make &s;o much profit.</P>

<P>In the Year 1615.

<P>Soon after which Captain <HI>Dormer</HI> coming for <HI>England</HI> from <HI>New-found-Land,</HI> and Landing at <HI>Plymouth,</HI> apply'd him&s;elf to the Governor, by whom he was di&s;patch'd away, with Direction to meet Captain <HI>Rocroft,</HI> &s;ent away a little before; but <HI>Ro|croft</HI> being dead by that time <HI>Dormer</HI> could come after him to <HI>Virginia,</HI> where he heard he was, he returning to <HI>Capawick,</HI> was there &s;et upon by <HI>Erpenow,</HI> the fore|mention'd Salvage, and other <HI>Indians</HI> that were Con&s;pirators with him; and within a &s;hort while after at <HI>Virginia,</HI> whither he went to be cur'd of the Wounds he re|ceiv'd in that A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, he fell &s;ick and died.</P>
<P>About the Year 1623.

<P>By the&s;e &s;everal Colonies &s;ent &s;o thick one after another, both a full Di&s;covery of the Countrey came to be made, and a large gap open'd to the free po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof; yet in regard of the many di&s;appointments and misfortunes the &s;everal Companies &s;ent over met with, and counting the va&s;t Charges their &s;etting forth co&s;t the Undertakers, which would have been &s;till increas'd by the need of conti|nu'd Supplies, in all probability <HI>New England</HI> would have been but thinly peopled to this day, had not a great Tide of People, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with an aver&s;ion to the Church-Government of <HI>England,</HI> and fled into <HI>Holland</HI> for <HI>Liberty of Con&s;cience,</HI> ea|gerly taken hold of this opportunity to make them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of their own Opinions, and of a Place where they might erect a Government &s;uitable there|unto: and though at fir&s;t there were &s;ome Exceptions taken, as if this Countrey was to be made a Receptacle of Sectaries, and &s;uch as condemn'd the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Government of the Nation, in&s;omuch that Sir <HI>Ferdinando Gorges,</HI> to whom they ap|ply'd them&s;elves, de&s;iring him to mediate for them to the Council of <HI>New Englands</HI> Affairs, when they perceiv'd the Authority they had from the <HI>Virginia</HI> Company, could not warrant their abode there, had enough to do (notwith&s;tanding his Apology, <HI>That the&s;e things hapned contrary to his expectation</HI>) to wipe away the jea|lou&s;ie which was entertain'd of him, it being Order'd, that no more &s;hould be &s;uf|fer'd to pa&s;s into <HI>New England,</HI> but &s;uch as &s;hould take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy: yet at la&s;t there was little notice taken who went, perhaps upon con|&s;ideration, that the va&s;t re&s;ort of People thither would be of greater advantage to the Plantations, than their different Opinions, at &s;o remote a di&s;tance, could be pre|judicial, &s;o long as they acknowledg'd Obedience to the King and Civil Power: However, Sir <HI>Ferdinando,</HI> to clear him&s;elf the better, mov'd tho&s;e Lords that were the chief Actors in the Bu&s;ine&s;s, to re&s;ign their Grand Patent to the King, and pa&s;s
<PB N="143" REF="87">particular Patents to them&s;elves of &s;uch part of the Countrey along the Sea-Coa&s;t, as might be &s;ufficient for them: To this Motion there being a general A&s;&s;ent given by the Lords, and a Day appointed for the conclu&s;ion thereof, an Act was made for the Re&s;ignation of the Patent, alloting to each Man their &s;everal Bounds. From the uttermo&s;t parts began the Limits of the Lord <HI>Mougrave,</HI> and ended at <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s <HI>River.</HI> To the Ea&s;tward of which River, for the &s;pace of &s;ixty Miles in length, was plac'd the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI>'s A&s;&s;ignment: Next to him was &s;etled the Earl of <HI>Carlile:</HI> Next him the Lord <HI>Edward Gorges:</HI> Next the Marque&s;s of <HI>Hamilton:</HI> Then Captain <HI>John Ma&s;on:</HI> And la&s;tly his own, which extended to the great River <HI>Sagadehoc,</HI> being &s;ixty Miles, and &s;o up into the Main Land a hundred and twenty Miles, which he was pleas'd to call by the Name of <HI>The Province of Main.</HI></P>
<P>The Landing of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>Plymouth</HI> Plantation was very much facilitated by the great Mortality that hapned among&s;t the <HI>Indians</HI> about that time, among&s;t the <HI>Pecods, Narragan&s;ets, Nianticks, Tarantines, Wippanaps,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Abargini, Agi&s;&s;awang,</HI> and <HI>Pockanekie,</HI> their <HI>Powwows,</HI> or Doctors, &s;eeing with amazement their <HI>Wigwams,</HI> or Streets, lie full of dead Bodies, and in vain expecting help from <HI>Squantam</HI> their good, or <HI>Abbamoch</HI> their bad God.

They Landed at fir&s;t with little or no re&s;i&s;tance, a handful of Men onely being &s;ent before to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for their Companions, who arriv'd eight days after; when the Natives appearing with their Bowes and Arrows, let flie their long Shafts among&s;t them; whereupon one Captain <HI>Miles Standi&s;h</HI> with his Fowling-piece &s;hot the &s;toute&s;t <HI>Sachem</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Indians,</HI> as he was reaching an Arrow from his Quiver; which the re&s;t &s;eeing, fled into the Woods and Thickets.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Year the <HI>Merchant-Advenurers</HI> in <HI>England</HI> &s;ent forth &s;tore of Servants to provide again&s;t the Wants of that place; among&s;t whom came over a mix'd Mul|titude, who &s;etled them&s;elves in the Bo&s;om of the Cape now call'd <HI>Glouce&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>About the Year 1651. there fled to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> at <HI>Water-town</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> that dwelt thereabouts, for protection again&s;t the <HI>Tarratines,</HI> a &s;ort of cruel and &s;alvage Canni|bals, by whom near the Town of <HI>Saugu&s;t,</HI> in the very dead time of the Night, one Lieutenant <HI>Walker</HI> being on a &s;udden alarm'd, was &s;hot through his Coat and Buff Jacket with two Indian Arrows. That Night the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;tood upon their Guard, and the next Morning &s;ent word to other parts; who gather'd together, and taking coun&s;el how to quit them&s;elves of the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> agreed to di&s;charge their great Guns; who&s;e redoubled noi&s;e, ratling in the Rocks, &s;truck terror into the <HI>Indi|ans,</HI> and caus'd them to betake them&s;elves to flight. The Autumn following, others of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who till then had held a good corre&s;pondence with the Planters, be|gan to quarrel about the Bounds of their Land; but a great Mortality, by the ra|ging of the Small-Pox, breaking out among&s;t them, put an end to that Contro|ver&s;ie: There died among&s;t the re&s;t one of the chief of the <HI>Sagamores</HI> of the <HI>Matta|chu&s;ets,</HI> call'd <HI>Sagamore John,</HI> who before his Death had been in&s;tructed in the <HI>Chri|&s;tian</HI> Faith, and took care that his two Sons &s;hould be nurtur'd therein.</P>
<P>In the Year 1635. there arrived &s;everal Ships with great plenty of Provi&s;ions, and many Per&s;ons of good Quality, and among&s;t the re&s;t Sir <HI>Henry Vane.</HI></P>

<P>About the Year 1638. the <HI>Pequods,</HI> a &s;tout and Warlike Nation, lying to the
<PB N="144" REF="88">South-We&s;t of the <HI>Mattachu&s;ets,</HI> were di&s;cover'd upon their March within &s;ome few Miles of <HI>Hartford:</HI> Their coming very much terrifi'd all that inhabited therea|bouts; but they took onely three Women and return'd; one of whom making a violent re&s;i&s;tance, had her Brains beaten out; the other two they carried away with them, without abu&s;ing their Per&s;ons, as it was &s;uppos'd they would, for they e&s;teem'd their own <HI>Shaws,</HI> being black, beyond our Women. Their chief De&s;ign was to learn to make Gunpowder; which &s;eeing they could not effect, they look'd upon their Prize as nothing &s;o precious as they imagin'd.</P>
<P>A little after another <HI>Indian</HI> War threatning the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> they re&s;olv'd together to &s;end an Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Cannonicus,</HI> chief <HI>Sachem</HI> of the <HI>Naragan&s;its,</HI> endeavoring to prevent him from confederating with the <HI>Pequods,</HI> who (as they had Intelligence) were about &s;ending to him to joyn with them: <HI>Cannonicus</HI> being grown old, had re|&s;ign'd the Government to his Nephew <HI>Mantinemo,</HI> a &s;tern Man, and of a cruel Na|ture. The Amba&s;&s;adors arriving at his Court, which was about eighty Miles from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> the <HI>Indian</HI> Prince a&s;&s;embled his chief Councellors, and having Entertain'd the Amba&s;&s;adors Magnificently, and Fea&s;ted them Royally, gave them Audience in his State-hou&s;e; where the <HI>Sachem,</HI> to manife&s;t his greater State, lay along upon the Ground, with all his Nobility &s;itting about him, with their Legs doubled up, and their Knees touching their Chin: The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Interpreter having made his Speech in the Name of the re&s;t, both <HI>Cannonicus</HI> and the young King gave di&s;creet An&s;wers, &s;ignifying their Re&s;olutions to keep a fair Corre&s;pondence with the <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI> and yet not to fall out with the <HI>Pequods:</HI> Who a little after making al&s;o their Addre&s;&s;es to the &s;ame King, he di&s;&s;waded them by many Rea&s;ons from making War with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and to deliver into their hands tho&s;e Per&s;ons that had murther'd any of them. The <HI>Pequods</HI> neverthele&s;s, though they &s;eem'd inclinable to his Coun|&s;el, yet they acted as Enemies; for when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ent a Company of Soldiers into their Countrey to treat with them about delivering up the Murtherers, they made &s;hew of willingne&s;s, but &s;pying their advantage, betook them&s;elves to their Heels; and whom&s;oever they took &s;tragling by &s;urpri&s;e, they revil'd and in|&s;ulted over in a mo&s;t cruel manner, vilifying the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion, and uttering all the Bla&s;phemies they could invent. Whereupon they rais'd fre&s;h Souldiers for the War, to the number of four &s;core, out of the &s;everal Towns in the <HI>Mattachu&s;ets,</HI> and with &s;ome <HI>Indian</HI> Guides came to their Fort, within which they had pitch'd their <HI>Wigwams,</HI> the Entrance being on two &s;ides, with intricate Meanders to enter; at which were plac'd <HI>Indian</HI> Bowe-men, who &s;hot the foremo&s;t of the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> yet they had little to boa&s;t of in the end, for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ru&s;hing in through the winding Ways, and placing them&s;elves round the <HI>Wigwams,</HI> made a very pro&s;perous Shot, by directing the Muzzles of their Mu&s;quets again&s;t the <HI>Indians</HI> which lay &s;leeping on the Ground: In the mid&s;t of which rouzing terror and confu&s;ion they were defeated with little ado, mo&s;t of them being either wounded, kill'd, or taken. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> thus animated with the fir&s;t Victory, &s;end their Pri&s;oners to the Pinna|ces, and pro&s;ecute the War in Hand, marching again&s;t the next Body of the <HI>Indians,</HI> which lay Encamp'd on a Hill about two Miles di&s;tant, where they gave them a &s;econd Overthrow, &s;laying many more than in the fir&s;t Engagement; the re&s;t flying to a very thick inacce&s;&s;ible Swamp or Bog, were there be&s;ieg'd by the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and skulking up and down, as they &s;aw their opportunity they would Shoot at them with their Arrows, and then &s;uddenly fall flat along in the Water; at la&s;t the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> finding out a Pa&s;&s;age into the Swamp, utterly defeated them, and put an end to the War with the lo&s;s of few Mens Lives, and not many wounded.</P>
<P>In the Year 1640. there came over a fre&s;h Supply of People into <HI>New England,</HI> and

When they go to their Wars, it is their Cu&s;tom to paint their Faces with diver&s;ity of Colours, &s;ome being all black as Jet, &s;ome red, &s;ome half red and half black, &s;ome black and white, others &s;potted with divers kinds of Colours, being all di&s;guis'd to their Enemies, to make them more terrible to their Foes, putting on likewi&s;e their rich Jewels, Pendents, and <HI>Wampom|peage,</HI> to put them in mind that they Fight not onely for their Children, Wives and Lives, but likewi&s;e for their Goods, Lands and Liberties. Being thus Arm'd with this Warlike Paint, the antique Warriors make towards their Enemies in a di&s;or|der'd manner, without any Soldier-like Marching, or Warlike Po&s;tures, being deaf to any word of Command, ignorant of falling off or on, of doubling Ranks or Files, but let flie their winged Shaft&s;men without either fear or wit: Their Artil|lery being &s;pent, he that hath no Arms to Fight, finds Legs to run away.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Games and Sports of activity.</NOTE>They have two &s;orts of Games, one call'd <HI>Puim,</HI> the other <HI>Hubbub,</HI> not much un|like Cards and Dice, being no other than Lottery. <HI>Puim</HI> is fifty or &s;ixty &s;mall Bents of a Foot long, which they divide to the number of their Game&s;ters, &s;huffling them fir&s;t between the Palms of their Hands; be that hath more than his Fellow, is &s;o much the forwarder in his Game: Many other Whim&s;ies be in this Game, which would be too long to commit to Paper. He that is a noted Game&s;ter hath a Hole in his Ear, wherein he carries his <HI>Puims</HI> in defiance of his Antagoni&s;ts. <HI>Hubbub</HI> is five &s;mall Bones in a &s;mall &s;mooth Tray; the Bones be like a Die, but &s;omething flatter, black on the one &s;ide and white on the other, which they place on the Ground, again&s;t which violently thumping the Platter, the Bones mount, changing colours with the windy whisking of their Hands to and fro; which action in that &s;port they much u&s;e, &s;miting them&s;elves on the Bea&s;t and Thighs, crying out <HI>Hub, Hub, Hub;</HI> they may be heard play at this Game a quarter of a Mile off: The Bones being all black or white make a double Game; if three of one colour, and two of another, then they afford but a &s;ingle Game; four, of a colour, and one differing, is nothing; &s;o long as the Man wins he keeps the Tray, but if he loo&s;e the next Man takes it. They are &s;o bewitch'd with the&s;e two Games, that they will lo&s;e &s;ometimes all they have; Beaver, <HI>Moo&s;e</HI>-skins, Kettles, <HI>Wampompeage, Mo|whacks,</HI> Hatchets, Knives, all is confi&s;cate by the&s;e two Games. For their Sports of
<PB N="156" REF="94">action they have commonly but three or four, as Football, Shooting, Running, and Swimming; when they play Countrey again&s;t Countrey, there are rich Goals, all behung with <HI>Wampompeage, Mowhacks,</HI> Beaver Skins, and black Otter Skins: Their Goals are a Mile long plac'd on the Sands, which are as even as a Board; their Ball is no bigger than a Hand-ball, which &s;ometimes they mount in the Air with their naked Feet, &s;ometimes it is &s;way'd by the multitude, &s;ometime al&s;o it is two days before they get a Goal, then they mark the Ground they win, and begin there the next day. Before they come to this Sport they paint them&s;elves, even as when they go to War, in policy to prevent future mi&s;chief, becau&s;e no man &s;hould know him that mov'd his patience, or accidentally hurt his Per&s;on, taking away the oc|ca&s;ion of &s;tudying revenge. Before they begin, their Arms are put off, and hung upon &s;ome neighboring Tree, after which they make a long &s;crowl on the Sand, over which they &s;hake Hands, and with loving Hearts &s;cuffle for Victory. While the Men Play, the Boys Pipe, and the Women Dance and Sing Trophies of their Husbands Conque&s;ts; all being done, a Fea&s;t &s;ummons their departure.</P>
<P>Such is their dexterity in Shooting, that they can hit a running Hind, or flying Pigeon, without a &s;tanding pau&s;e or left-ey'd blinking; they draw their Arrows between their Fingers and the Thumb; their Bowes are quick, but not very &s;trong, not killing at above &s;ix or &s;even &s;core di&s;tance: Shooting at one another, they have a trick with &s;wift conveyance to &s;hun the Arrow; this they do to make them expert again&s;t time of War. They are train'd up to their Bowes even from their Childhood; for little Boys with Bowes made of little Sticks, and Arrows made of great Bents, will hit down a piece of Tobacco-pipe every time a good way off. As the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> are good Marks-men, &s;o are they well experienc'd where the very Life of every Creature lieth, and know where to &s;mite him to make him die pre&s;ently. Their Swimming is not after our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fa&s;hion, of &s;pread Arms and Legs, which they hold too tire&s;om, but like Dogs, their Arms before them, cut|ting through the Liquids with their right Shoulder: In this manner they will Swim very &s;wift and far, either in rough or &s;mooth Waters, &s;ometimes for their ea&s;e lying as &s;till as a Log; &s;ometimes they will play the Dive-doppers, and come up in unexpected places.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Huntings.</NOTE>For their Hunting, it is to be noted, that they have no &s;wift-footed Greyhounds to let &s;lip at the &s;ight of the Deer, no deep-mouth'd Hounds, or &s;centing Beagles, to find out their de&s;ired Prey; them&s;elves are all this, who in that time of the year when the Deer comes down, having certain Hunting-hou&s;es in &s;uch places where they know the Deer doth u&s;ually frequent, in which they keep their Rendezvouz, their Snares, and all their Accoutrements for that Employment: when they get &s;ight of a Deer, <HI>Moo&s;e,</HI> or Bear, they &s;tudy how to get the Wind of him, and ap|proaching within &s;hot, &s;tab their Mark quite through, if the Bones hinder not. The chief thing they Hunt after is Deer, <HI>Moo&s;es</HI> and Bears: It grieves them more to &s;ee an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-man take one Deer, than a thou&s;and Acres of Land. They Hunt likewi&s;e after Wolves, wild Cats, <HI>Rackoons,</HI> Otters, Beavers, and <HI>Mu&s;quashes,</HI> Trading both their Skins and Fle&s;h to the <HI>English.</HI> Be&s;ide this Artillery they have other devices to kill their Game, as &s;ometimes Hedges, a Mile or two Miles long, being a Mile wide at one end, and made narrower and narrower by degrees, lea|ving onely a Gap of &s;ix Foot long; over again&s;t which in the day-time they lie lurking, to &s;hoot the Deer which come through that narrow pa&s;&s;age; &s;o many as come within the circumference of that Hedge, &s;eldom return back to leap over, unle&s;s they be forc'd by the cha&s;ing of &s;ome ravenous Wolf, or &s;ight of &s;ome acci|dental Pa&s;&s;enger: In the Night, at the Gap of this Hedge, they &s;et Deer-traps,
<PB N="157" REF="94">which are Springes made of young Trees, and &s;mooth wrought Cords, &s;o &s;trong, that it will to&s;s a Hor&s;e if he be caught in it.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Fi&s;hings.</NOTE>In the Trade of Fi&s;hing they are very expert, being experienc'd in the know|ledge of all Baits for &s;everal Fi&s;hes, and divers Sea&s;ons; being not ignorant like|wi&s;e of the removal of Fi&s;hes, knowing when to Fi&s;h in Rivers, and when at Rocks, when in Bays, and when at Seas: Since the <HI>English</HI> came they are furni&s;h'd with <HI>English</HI> Hooks and Lines, for before they made them of Hemp, being more curi|ou&s;ly wrought, of &s;tronger Materials than ours, and hook'd with Bone-Hooks; but lazine&s;s drives them to buy, more than profit or commendations wins them to make of their own. They make likewi&s;e very &s;trong Sturgeon-nets, with which they catch Sturgeons of twelve, fourteen, and &s;ixteen, and &s;ome eighteen Foot long in the day-time, and in the night-time they betake them&s;elves to their Birchen <HI>Canoos,</HI> in which they carry a forty-fathom Line, with a &s;harp-bearded Dart fa&s;tned at the end thereof; then lighting a Torch made of Birchen Rinds, they wave it to and again by their <HI>Canoo</HI> &s;ide, which the Sturgeon much delighted with, comes to them tumbling and playing, turning up his white Belly, into which they thru&s;t their Lance, his Back being impenetrable; which done, they hale to the Shore their &s;trugling Prize. They have often recour&s;e into the Rocks whereupon the Sea beats, in warm Weather, to look out for &s;leepy Seals, who&s;e Oyl they much e&s;teem, u&s;ing it for divers things. In Summer they Fi&s;h any where, but in Winter in the fre&s;h Water onely, and Ponds; in fro&s;ty Weather they cut round Holes in the Ice, about which they will &s;it like &s;o many Apes with their naked Breeches upon the cold Ice, catching of Pikes, Pearches, Breams, and other &s;orts of fre&s;h-Water Fi&s;h.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Arts and Mantifa|ctures.</NOTE>Their Arts and Manufactures are divers, as fir&s;t their dre&s;&s;ing of all manner of Skins, which they do by &s;craping and rubbing, afterwards painting them with antique Embroiderings in unchangeable Colours; &s;ometimes they take off the Hair, e&s;pecially if it be not kill'd in &s;ea&s;on. Their Bowes they make of a hand&s;om &s;hape, &s;trung commonly with the Sinews of <HI>Moo&s;es;</HI> their Arrows of young Elder, feather'd with Feathers of Eagles Wings and Tails, headed with Bra&s;s in &s;hape of a Heart or Triangle, fa&s;tned in a &s;lender piece of Wood &s;ix or eight Inches long, which is fram'd to put loo&s;e in the pithy Elder, aftewards bound fa&s;t for riving: Their Arrows are made in this manner, becau&s;e it might &s;hake from his Head, and be left behind for their finding, and the Pile onely re|main to gaul the wounded Bea&s;t. Their Cordage is &s;o even, &s;oft, and &s;mooth, that it looks more like Silk than Hemp. Their Sturgeon Nets are not deep, nor above thirty or forty Foot long; which in ebbing low Waters they &s;take fa&s;t to the Ground where they are &s;ure the Sturgeon will come, never looking more at it till the next low Water. Their <HI>Canoos</HI> are made either of Pine-trees, which before they were acquainted with <HI>English</HI> Tools, they burn'd hollow, &s;craping them &s;mooth with Clam-&s;hells and Oy&s;ter-&s;hells, cutting their out-&s;ides With Stone Hatchets. The&s;e Boats are not above a Foot and a half, or two Foot wide, and twenty Foot long. Their other <HI>Canoos</HI> be made of thin Birch Rinds, clo&s;e Ribb'd, and on the in-&s;ide with broad thin Hoops, like the Hoops of a Tub; the&s;e are made very light, a Man may carry one of them a Mile, being made purpo&s;ely to carry from River to River, and from Bay to Bay, to &s;horten Land-pa&s;&s;ages. In the&s;e cockling Fly-boats, wherein an <HI>English</HI>-man can &s;carce &s;it without a fearful tottering, they will venture to Sea, when an <HI>English</HI> Shallop dare not bear a Knot of Sail, &s;cudding over the over-grown Waves as fa&s;t as a wind-driven Ship, being driven by their Paddles, being much like Battle-doors; if a cro&s;s Wave (which is &s;eldom) turn her Keel up-&s;ide down, they by &s;wimming free her, and &s;cramble into her again.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Lan|guage.</NOTE>Their Language, is onely peculiar to them&s;elves, not inclining to any of the more refined Tongues.

Their Lan|guage is hard to learn, few of the <HI>English</HI> being able to &s;peak any of it, or capable of the right pronunciation, which is the chief grace of their Tongue: They pro|nounce much after the Diphthongs, excluding <HI>L</HI> and <HI>R,</HI> which in our <HI>English</HI> Tongue they pronounce with as much difficulty, as mo&s;t of the <HI>Dutch</HI> do <HI>T</HI> and <HI>H,</HI> calling a Lob&s;ter a <HI>Nob&s;tann.</HI> Every Countrey doth &s;omething differ in their Speech, even as our Northern People do from the Southern, and We&s;tern from them; e&s;pe|cially the <HI>Tarrentine,</HI> who&s;e Tongue runs &s;o much upon <HI>R,</HI> that they wharle much in pronunciation.

Al&s;o it hath the great Lakes which tend towards <HI>Cali|fornia</HI> in the South Sea on the We&s;t thereof: On the North thereof is the great River of <HI>Canada,</HI> into which the &s;aid River di&s;gorgeth it &s;elf by a fair large River, well repleni&s;h'd with many fruitful I&s;lands: The Air thereof is pure and whole&s;om, the Countrey plea&s;ant, having &s;ome high Hills, full of goodly Forre&s;ts, and fair Valleys and Plains, fruitful in Corn, Vines, Che&s;nuts, Wallnuts, and infinite &s;orts of other Fruits, large Rivers well &s;tor'd with Fi&s;h, and inviron'd with goodly Mea|dows full of Timber-trees.</P>
<P>One of the great Lakes is call'd <HI>The Lake of Troquois,</HI> which together with a Ri|ver of the &s;ame Name, running into the River of <HI>Canada,</HI> is &s;ixty or &s;eventy Leagues in length.</P>
<P>In the Lake are four fair I&s;lands, which are low and full of goodly Woods and Meadows, having &s;tore of Game for Hunting, as Stags, Fallow-Deer, Elks, Roe-Bucks, Beavers, and other &s;orts of Bea&s;ts which come from the Main Land to the &s;aid I&s;lands.</P>
<P>The Rivers which fall into the Lakes have in them good &s;tore of Beavers; of which Bea&s;ts, as al&s;o of the Elks, the Salvages make their chiefe&s;t Traffick.</P>
<P>The &s;aid I&s;lands have been inhabited heretofore by the Salvages, but are now abandon'd by rea&s;on of their late Wars one with another: They contain twelve or fifteen Leagues in length, and are &s;eated commodiou&s;ly for Habitation in the mid&s;t of the Lake, which abounds with divers kinds of whole&s;om Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>From this Lake run two Rivers Southward, which fall into the Ea&s;tern and Southern Sea-Coa&s;t of <HI>New England.</HI></P>
<P>Into this Lake there went many years &s;ince certain <HI>French</HI> of <HI>Quebeck,</HI> who &s;ided with the <HI>Algovinquins,</HI> with the help of their <HI>Canoos,</HI> which they carried the &s;pace of five Miles over the <HI>Impo&s;sible Falls,</HI> to Fight a Battel in revenge of &s;ome former In|juries done by the <HI>Troquois</HI> to the <HI>Algovinquins,</HI> who had the Victory; for which cau&s;e the <HI>French</HI> have been &s;o hated ever &s;ince by the Nation of the <HI>Troquois,</HI> that none of them dur&s;t ever appear in any part of that Lake. But their Trade, &s;aid to be &s;ixteen thou&s;and Beavers yearly, is partly &s;old to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who Trade with the We&s;t|end of the &s;aid Lake over Land by Hor&s;es, from their Plantation upon <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s <HI>River:</HI> and another part is conceiv'd to be purchas'd by the <HI>Hiroons,</HI> who being Newters, are Friends both to the one and the other; and the&s;e <HI>Hiroons</HI> bring down the greate&s;t part of all by the River of <HI>Canada.</HI></P>
<P>The Way over Land to this great Lake, from the Plantation of <HI>Pa&s;cataway,</HI> hath been attempted by Captain <HI>Walter Neale,</HI> once Governor, at the Charges of Sir <HI>Fer|dinando Gorges,</HI> Captain <HI>Ma&s;on,</HI> and &s;ome Merchants of <HI>London,</HI> and the Di&s;covery wanted but one days Journey of fini&s;hing, becau&s;e their Victuals was &s;pent, which, for want of Hor&s;es, they were enforc'd to carry with their Arms, and their Clothes, upon their Backs: They intended to have made a &s;ettlement for Trade by Pinnaces upon the &s;aid Lake, which they reckon to be about ninety or a hundred Miles from the Plantation over Land.</P>

<P>The People of the Countrey are given to Hunting of wild Bea&s;ts, which is their chiefe&s;t Food.</P>

Their Under|&s;tandings being improv'd by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> they are quick of apprehen&s;ion, to di|&s;tingui&s;h good from bad: they will not endure any Oppre&s;&s;ion, but are very patient of Heat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Stoves.</NOTE> Cold, Hunger and Thir&s;t. They have a &s;trange way of u&s;ing Stoves, which are &s;et in the Ground and cover'd with Earth, into which they go through a little Door.

<P>Though the&s;e People know no great di&s;tinction between Man and Man, as other Nations, yet they have noble and ignoble Families among&s;t them; &s;uperior and inferior Offices, which they enjoy by Inheritance; but &s;ometimes the Martial Offices are be&s;towed according to the Valour of the Per&s;ons: Their Generals &s;el|dom give their Enemies a Field-Battel, by drawing or dividing their Men into Re|giments or Companies, but make it their whole De&s;ign to defeat their Enemies by &s;udden Sallies from Ambu&s;cado's; for they never &s;tand out a clo&s;e Fight, unle&s;s compell'd to it, but if encompa&s;s'd round, they fight to the la&s;t Man.

Here one may travel by Land upon the &s;ame Continent hundreds of Miles, and pa&s;s through Towns and Villages, and never hear the lea&s;t complaint for want, nor hear any ask him for a Farthing. Here one may lodge in the Fields and Woods, travel from one end of the Countrey to another, with as much &s;ecurity as if he were lock'd within his own Chamber: And if one chance to meet with an <HI>Indian</HI> Town, they &s;hall give him the be&s;t Entertain|ment they have, and upon his de&s;ire direct him on his Way.

<P>In Summer, the heats are equal to tho&s;e of <HI>Spain,</HI> but qualifi'd daily about Noon, at that time of the Year, either with &s;ome gentle Breezes, or &s;mall Showres of Rain: In Winter there is Fro&s;t and Snow, and &s;ometimes it is extremely cold, in&s;omuch, that the Rivers and the Northerly part of the Bay of <HI>Che&s;apeack</HI> are Fro|zen, but it &s;eldom la&s;ts long; and &s;ome Winters are &s;o warm, that People have gone in half Shirts and Drawers only at <HI>Chri&s;tmas:</HI> But in the Spring and Autumn, (<HI>viz.</HI>) in <HI>March, April,</HI> and <HI>May, September, October,</HI> and <HI>November,</HI> there is generally

Going towards the Countrey of the <HI>Mangoacks</HI> (among whom in the Province of <HI>Chaunis Temoatan,</HI> they heard of a Mine of &s;trange Copper call'd <HI>Wa&s;&s;ador,</HI> with <HI>Skiko,</HI> the King of <HI>Chowonock</HI>'s Son, and <HI>Manteo,</HI> a faithful Salvage, for their Guide) they were treacherou&s;ly dealt with by <HI>Wingina,</HI> alias <HI>Pemi&s;&s;apan</HI> (for &s;o, his Brother <HI>Granganimeo</HI> being lately dead, he had alter'd his Name) who endeavor'd to &s;tir up a Confederacy of the <HI>Chawonocks, Moratocks,</HI> and <HI>Mangoacks</HI> again&s;t them; yet by the urgent per&s;wa&s;ions of <HI>En&s;enore</HI> his Father, the true&s;t Friend the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had, after the death of <HI>Granganimeo,</HI> and &s;eeing them &s;afe return'd from their Journey, wherein he thought they had all peri&s;h'd, and e&s;pecially upon <HI>Menatonon's</HI> &s;ending Me&s;&s;en|gers to them with Pearl, and <HI>Oki&s;co,</HI> King of <HI>Weopomeock,</HI> to yield him&s;elf Va&s;&s;al to the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> his Hatred was &s;omewhat cool'd; but <HI>En&s;enore</HI> decea&s;ing &s;oon after, he return'd to his old treacherous Practi&s;es again, and in the end, while he was contriving mi&s;chief again&s;t the Planters, he him&s;elf was &s;hot, taken Pri&s;oner, and beheaded.</P>
<P>After the Company left upon <HI>Virginia</HI> by Sir <HI>Richard Greenwill,</HI> (for he him&s;elf was return'd) tir'd out with hunger, hard&s;hip, and the many extremities they were at la&s;t reduc'd to, had de&s;erted the Place, and obtain'd Pa&s;&s;age for <HI>England,</HI> through the civility of Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> pitying their di&s;tre&s;s, fifty Men more were Landed upon <HI>Roanoack-I&s;le</HI> by the &s;ame Per&s;on, who how they were &s;urpris'd and de&s;troy'd by the Natives, was di&s;cover'd at large to the Supply that was &s;ent over in the Year 1587. by Mr. <HI>White.</HI></P>

<P>A Party of tho&s;e that went over with Captain <HI>Bartholomew Go&s;nol,</HI> Captain <HI>John Smith,</HI> &amp;c. were by the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;et upon as they were rai&s;ing a Fort near <HI>Cape Henry,</HI> where they Landed, &s;eventeen Men hurt, one &s;lain, and all in danger to have been utterly de&s;troy'd, had not a Shot happily made from the Ships by chance frighted away the Salvages. Another &s;mall Party under Captain <HI>Smith,</HI> going down the River to <HI>Keconghean,</HI> were very fiercely a&s;&s;aulted by &s;ixty or &s;eventy <HI>Indians,</HI> but their Mu&s;quet-&s;hot did &s;uch Execution among&s;t them, that they fled into the Woods and left behind them the Image of their God, which had been carried before them as their Standard, and not long after &s;ent one of their <HI>Queiongca&s;ocks</HI> to offer Peace, and to redeem their <HI>Okee;</HI> which <HI>Smith</HI> granting, on condition &s;ix onely of them would come unarm'd and load his Boat with Provi&s;ions; and promi&s;ing moreover to become their Friend, and furni&s;h them with Beads, Copper, and Hatchets: They accepted the Condition, and brought him Veni&s;on, Turkies, wild Fowl, Bread, and what el&s;e they had, Singing and Dancing in &s;ign of Friend&s;hip till they de|parted.

<P>In his next Voyage for the di&s;covery of the Head of <HI>Chickamahania</HI> River, he was, through neglect of his Sea-men who were &s;ent to watch the Booty, taken Pri&s;oner; in which condition he was kept a whole Moneth: then being relea&s;ed, he got Pro|vi&s;ions for the People in <HI>James-Town;</HI> which had they not timely receiv'd, they had all abandon'd the Place, and return'd to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>While Affairs &s;tood thus in a mean condition, Captain <HI>Newport</HI> arriving there with a Ship and &s;ixty Men to &s;trengthen the Plantations, he went to <HI>Weromocomoco,</HI> where King <HI>Powhatan</HI> kept his Court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King <HI>Powha|tan.</HI></NOTE> and found him &s;itting on a Bed of Mats, and an Embroider'd Leather Cu&s;hion, Cloth'd in Deer-skins; at his Feet fat a young Maiden, and on each &s;ide of the Hou&s;e twenty Concubines; his Head and Shoul|ders were painted red, and a Chain of white Beads hung about his Neck. <HI>Newport,</HI> to oblige him, gave him an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Youth; in requital whereof he receiv'd <HI>Powha|tan</HI>'s bo&s;om Friend, <HI>Mamontak;</HI> with whom returning, he found a &s;ad Accident,

<P>A while after being inform'd of <HI>Powhatan</HI>'s De&s;ign to de&s;troy the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> (though he had been lately Pre&s;ented by <HI>Newport</HI> with a Silver Ba&s;in, a rich Chair, Bed, and Furniture belonging to it, with other things of value) he, to prevent him, cho&s;e forty eight out of two hundred Men which were Garri&s;on'd in <HI>James-Town,</HI> then going to <HI>Werowocomoco,</HI> Landed with much trouble, the River being frozen above half a Mile from the Shore.</P>
<P>A <HI>German</HI> Soldier among&s;t <HI>Smith</HI>'s Company giving private notice to <HI>Powhatan</HI> of the De&s;ign of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> made his E&s;cape by flight: But <HI>Smith</HI> going on to <HI>Pamaunke,</HI> found King <HI>Opechancangough</HI> with &s;even hundred Men in Arms, threat|ning a fierce Battel; but <HI>Smith</HI> making directly up to him, &s;et his Pi&s;tol on his Brea&s;t, and forc'd him to lay down his Arms. <HI>Powhatan</HI> by this time provided with Swords and Mu&s;quets by two <HI>Dutch</HI>-men, al&s;o began to be&s;tir him&s;elf afre&s;h; but his Intentions being too &s;oon known, he was again quieted, and forc'd a &s;econd time to &s;end <HI>Smith</HI> a String of Pearl; after which a Peace was concluded between all the Natives and the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Many other Quarrels and Encounters there were in the Infancy of the Planta|tion between the <HI>Indians</HI> and the <HI>English,</HI> wherein it would be endle&s;s to recount all the Treacheries and Ambu&s;cades of the Salvages, &s;ome of which had prov'd very pernicious to the Planters, had they not been betray'd to Captain <HI>Smith</HI> by <HI>Poca|honta,</HI> King <HI>Powhatan</HI>'s Daughter, who upon all occa&s;ions &s;hew'd her &s;elf a great Friend to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> having &s;av'd the Captain's Life, when, being her Father's Pri|&s;oner, he was ju&s;t brought to Execution.</P>
<P>This Lady was afterwards brought into <HI>England,</HI> Chri&s;tned by the Name of <HI>Rebekah,</HI> and Married to one Mr. <HI>Rolf,</HI> and died at <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> in an intended Voy|age back to her own Countrey.</P>
<P>Nor did their Cruelties and Treacheries end when the Plantation came to be more &s;etled, for on the two and twentieth of <HI>March</HI> about the Year 1621. in the time of Sir <HI>Francis Wyat</HI>'s Government, they generally combin'd to de&s;troy all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> there; and carried on this devili&s;h De&s;ign with &s;uch di&s;&s;imulation and dex|terity, that in one day they cut off &s;even hundred Men, Women, and Children, there being at that time not above fifteen hundred in the Countrey.</P>

<HEAD>The Relation of Captain <HI>Smith</HI>'s being taken Pri&s;oner by <HI>Powhatan,</HI> and of his being deliver'd from Death by his Daughter <HI>Pocahonta.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THe Salvages having drawn from one <HI>George Ca&s;&s;en,</HI> whither Captain <HI>Smith</HI> was gone, pro&s;ecuting that opportunity, they follow'd him with three hundred Bowe-Men, conducted by the King of <HI>Pamaunkee,</HI> who in divi&s;ions, &s;earching the turnings of the River, found two of his Men by the fire &s;ide, whom they &s;hot full of Arrows, and &s;lew. Then finding the Captain, who, as is &s;aid, us'd the Salvage that was his Guide as his Shield, (three of them being &s;lain, and others &s;ore gall'd) the re&s;t would not come near him: Thinking thus to have return'd to his Boat, regarding them as he march'd, more than his way, he &s;lipp'd up to the middle in an O&s;ier-Creek, and his Salvage-with him, yet dur&s;t they not come to him, till being near dead with cold, he threw away his Arms: Then according to their compo&s;ition, they drew him forth, and led him to the Fire, where his Men were &s;lain; diligent|ly they chaf'd his benumm'd Limbs, he demanding for their Captain, they &s;hew'd him <HI>Opechankanough,</HI> King of <HI>Pamaunkee,</HI> to whom he gave a round Ivory double compa&s;s Dyal. Much they marvel'd at the playing of the Fly and Needle, which they could &s;ee &s;o plainly, and yet not touch it, becau&s;e of the Gla&s;s that cover'd them; but when he demon&s;trated by that Globe-like Jewel, the roundne&s;s of the Earth, and Skies; the Sphere of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and how the Sun did cha&s;e the Night round about the World continually; the greatne&s;s of the Land and Sea; the diver&s;ity of Nations, variety of Complexions, and how we were to them <HI>Antipodes,</HI> and many other &s;uch like matters, they all &s;tood as amaz'd with admiration: Notwith&s;tanding, within an hour after they ty'd him to a Tree, and as many as could &s;tand about him prepar'd to &s;hoot him; but the King holding up the Compa&s;s in his Hand, they all laid down their Bowes and Arrows, and in a triumphant manner led him to <HI>Orapaks,</HI> where he was after their manner kindly Fea&s;ted, and well us'd.</P>
<P>Their order in conducting him was thus; Drawing them&s;elves all in Fyle, the King in the mid&s;t had all their Bowes and Swords borne before him. Captain <HI>Smith</HI> was led after him by three great Salvages, holding him fa&s;t by each Arm; and on each &s;ide &s;ix went in Fyle with their Arrows nocked. But arriving at the Town (which was but onely thirty or forty Hunting Hou&s;es made of Mats, which they remove as they plea&s;e, as we our Tents) all the Women and Children &s;taring and gazing at him, the Souldiers fir&s;t all in Fyle wheel'd off to the Rear in good Order; on each Flank were Officers, like Serjeants to &s;ee them keep their Po&s;tures: A good time they continu'd this Exerci&s;e, and then ca&s;t them&s;elves in a Ring, Dancing in &s;uch &s;everal Po&s;tures, and &s;inging and yelling out &s;uch helli&s;h Notes
<PB N="203" REF="124">and Screeches; being &s;trangely Painted, every one his Quiver of Arrows, and at his Back a Club; on his Arm a Fox or an Otters-skin, or &s;ome &s;uch matter for his vambrace; their Heads and Shoulders Painted red, with Oyl and <HI>Pocones</HI> mingled together, which Scarlet-like colour, made an exceeding hand&s;ome &s;how; his Bowe in his Hand, and the Skin of a Bird with her Wings abroad dry'd, ty'd on his Head, a piece of Copper, a white Shell, a long Feather, with a &s;mall Rattle growing at the Tails of their Snaks ty'd to it, or &s;ome &s;uch like Toy. All this while <HI>Smith</HI> and the King &s;tood in the mid&s;t, guarded, as before is &s;aid, and after three Dances they all departed. <HI>Smith</HI> they conducted to a long Hou&s;e, where thirty or forty tall Fel|lows did guard him, and e're long, more Bread and Veni&s;on was brought him than would have &s;erv'd twenty Men, I think his Stomack at that time was not ve|ry good; what he left, they put in Baskets and ty'd over his Head. About mid|night they &s;et the Meat again before him; all this time none of them would eat a bit with him, till the next Morning they brought him as much more, and then did they eat all the old, and re&s;erv'd the new as they had done the other, which made him think they would feed him for &s;laughter: Yet in this de&s;perate e&s;tate to fend him from the cold, one <HI>Maoca&s;&s;ater</HI> brought him his Gown, in requital of &s;ome Beads and Toys <HI>Smith</HI> had given him at his fir&s;t arrival in <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>Two days after a man would have &s;lain him (but that the Guard prevented it) for the death of his Son, to whom they conducted him to recover the poor man then breathing his la&s;t. <HI>Smith</HI> told them, that at <HI>James-Town</HI> he had a Water would do it, if they would let him fetch it, but they would not permit that; but made all the preparations they could to a&s;&s;ault <HI>James-Town,</HI> craving his advice, and for re|compence he &s;hould have Life, Liberty, Land, and Women. In part of a Table|book he writ his mind to them&punc; at the Fort, what was intended, how they &s;hould follow that direction to affright the me&s;&s;engers, and without fail &s;end him &s;uch things as he writ for, and an Inventory with them. The difficulty and danger, he told the Salvages, of the Mines, great Guns, and other Engines, exceedingly af|frighted them, yet according to his Reque&s;t they went to <HI>James-Town,</HI> in as bitter weather as could be of Fro&s;t and Snow, and within three days return'd with an An|&s;wer.</P>
<P>But when they came to <HI>James-Town,</HI> &s;eeing Men &s;ally out as he had told them they would, they fled; yet in the night they came again to the &s;ame place where he had told them they &s;hould receive an&s;wer, and &s;uch things as he had promis'd them, which they found accordingly, and with which they return'd with no &s;mall expedition, to the wonder of them all, &s;uppo&s;ing that he could either Divine, or the Paper could &s;peak: then they led him to the <HI>Youthtanunds,</HI> the <HI>Mattapanients,</HI> the <HI>Payankatanks,</HI> the <HI>Nantaughtacunds,</HI> and <HI>Onawmanients</HI> upon the Rivers of <HI>Rapahanock,</HI> and <HI>Patawomek,</HI> through intricate ways, and back again by divers other &s;everal Na|tions, to the Kings Habitation at <HI>Pamaunkee,</HI> where they entertain'd him with mo&s;t &s;trange and fearful Conjurations. Not long after, early in the Morning, a great fire was made in a long Hou&s;e, and a Mat &s;pread on each &s;ide thereof; on the one they caus'd him to &s;it, and all the Guard went out of the Hou&s;e, and pre&s;ently there came skipping in a great grim Fellow, all Painted over with Coal, mingled with Oyl; and many Snakes and We&s;els skins &s;tuff'd with Mo&s;s, and all their Tails ty'd together, &s;o as they met on the Crown of his Head in a Ta&s;&s;el; and round about the Ta&s;&s;el was a Coronet of Feathers, the Skins hanging round about his Head, Back, and Shoulders, and in a manner cover'd his Face; with a helli&s;h voice, and a Rattle in his Hand. With mo&s;t &s;trange ge&s;tures and pa&s;&s;ions he began his Invocation, and environ'd the fire with a Circle of Meal; which
<PB N="204" REF="125">done, three more &s;uch like Devils came ru&s;hing in with the like antique Tricks, Painted half black, half red; but all their Eyes were Painted white, and &s;ome red &s;trokes like <HI>Mutchato's,</HI> along their Cheeks: round about him tho&s;e Fiends Danc'd a pretty while, and then came in three more as ugly as the re&s;t, with red Eyes, and white &s;trokes over their black Faces; at la&s;t they all &s;ate down right again&s;t him, three of them on the one hand of the chief Prie&s;t, and three on the other; then all with their Rattles began a Song, which ended, the chief Prie&s;t laid down five Wheat Corns, then &s;tretching his Arms and Hands with &s;uch violence, that he &s;weat, and his Veins &s;well'd, he began a &s;hort Oration: at the conclu&s;ion, they all gave a &s;hort groan, and then laid down three Grains more; after that, began their Song again, and then another Oration, ever laying down &s;o many Corns as before, till they had twice incircled the Fire; that done, they took a bunch of lit|tle Sticks, prepared for that purpo&s;e, continuing &s;till their Devotion, and at the end of every Song and Oration, they laid down a Stick between the Divi&s;ions of Corn: rill night, neither he nor they did either eat or drink, and then they fea|&s;ted merrily, with the be&s;t Provi&s;ions they could make: Three days they us'd this Ceremony, the meaning whereof they told him, was to know if he intended them well, or no. The Circle of Meal &s;ignifi'd their Countrey, the Circles of Corn the bounds of the Sea, and the Sticks his Countrey. They imagin'd the World to be flat and round, like a Trencher, and they in the mid&s;t. After this they brought him a Bag of Gun-powder, which they carefully pre&s;erv'd till the next Spring, to Plant as they did their Corn, becau&s;e they would be acquainted with the nature of that Seed; <HI>Opitchapam,</HI> the King's Brother, invited him to his Hou&s;e, where, with as ma|ny Platters of Bread, Fowl, and wild Bea&s;ts, as did environ him, he bid him well|come, but not any of them would eat a bit with him, but put up all the remainder in Baskets. At his return to <HI>Opechancanoughs,</HI> all the Kings Women, and their Chil|dren, flock'd about him for their Parts, as a due by Cu&s;tom, to be merry with &s;uch Fragments.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, they brought him to <HI>Meronocomoco,</HI> where was <HI>Powhatan</HI> their Emperor. Here more than two hundred of tho&s;e grim Courtiers &s;tood wondering at him, as he had been a Mon&s;ter; till <HI>Powhatan</HI> and his Train had put them&s;elves in their greate&s;t Braveries. Before a Fire, upon a &s;eat like a Bed&s;ted, he &s;at cover'd with a great Robe, made of <HI>Rarowcun</HI>-Skins, and all the Tails hanging by. On either hand did &s;it a young Maid, of &s;ixteen ox eighteen years of Age, and along on each &s;ide the Hou&s;e, two rows of Men, and behind them as many Women, with all their Heads and Shoulders Painted red; many of their Heads bedeck'd with the white Doun of Birds, but every one with &s;omething, and a great Chain of white Beads about their Necks. At his entrance before the Emperor, all the People gave a great &s;hout. The Queen of <HI>Appamatuck</HI> was appointed to bring him Water to wa&s;h his Hands, and another brought him a bunch of Feathers, in &s;tead of a Towel to dry them: Having Fea&s;ted him after their barbarous manner as well as they could, a long con&s;ultation was held, but in conclu&s;ion, two great Stones being brought before <HI>Powhatan,</HI> as many as could, laid Hands on him, dragg'd him to them, and thereon laid his Head, when being ready with their Clubs, to beat out his Brains, <HI>Pocahontas,</HI> the Emperors deare&s;t Daughter, &s;eeing no intreaty could prevail, got his Head in her Arms, and laid her own upon his to &s;ave him from death; whereat, the Emperor was contented he &s;hould live to make him Hatchets, and her Bells, Beads, and Copper; for they thought him a Man of all Occupations like them|&s;elves; for the King him&s;elf will make his own Robes, Shoes, Bowes, Arrows, Pots, Plant, Hunt, or do any thing as well as the re&s;t.</P>
<PB N="205" REF="125">
<P>Two days after, <HI>Powhatan</HI> having di&s;guis'd him&s;elf in the mo&s;t fearful minner he could, caus'd Captain <HI>Smith</HI> to be brought forth to a great Hou&s;e in the Woods, and there upon a Mat by the Fire to be left alone. Not long after, from behind a Mat that divided the Hou&s;e, was made the mo&s;t doleful noi&s;e he ever heard; then <HI>Powhatan,</HI> more like a Devil than a Man, with about two hundred more as black as him&s;elf, came unto him, and told him, That now they were Friends, and pre&s;ently he &s;hould go to <HI>James-Town,</HI> to &s;end him two great Guns and a Grind&s;tone, for which he would give him the Countrey of <HI>Capahowo&s;ick;</HI> and for ever e&s;teem him as his Son <HI>Nantaquoud.</HI> So to <HI>James-Town</HI> with twelve Guides <HI>Powhatan</HI> &s;ent him.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Situation and De&s;cription of <HI>Carolina.</HI></NOTE><HI>CArolina</HI> is that part of <HI>Florida</HI> which lies between twenty nine and thirty &s;ix Degrees and thirty Minutes of Northern Latitude: It is wa&s;h'd on the Ea&s;t and South, with the <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean; on the We&s;t with <HI>Mare Pacifi|cum,</HI> or the South Sea; and on the North, bounds on <HI>Virginia.</HI> A Countrey wherein Nature &s;hews how bountiful &s;he can be without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Art, the Inhabi|tants (excepting a little <HI>Maiz</HI> which their old Men and Women Plant) depending meerly on the natural and &s;pontaneous Growth of the Soil for their Provi&s;ions, the Woods furni&s;hing them with &s;tore of Fruit and Veni&s;on, and the Rivers with plenty of &s;everal &s;orts of whol&s;om and &s;avory Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>This Maintenance, which without foreca&s;t or toil they receive from the natural fruitfulne&s;s of the Countrey, will, if we con&s;ider either the largene&s;s of their Growth, or the duration of their Lives, be thought neither &s;canty nor unhealthy, their Stature being of a larger &s;ize than that of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-men, their Make &s;trong and well proportion'd, a crooked or mi&s;-&s;hapen Per&s;on being not to be found in the whole Countrey; and (where the chance of War, which they are almo&s;t continu|ally engag'd in one again&s;t another in their little Governments, &s;pares any of them) they live to an incredible old age; &s;o that when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> came there, they found &s;ome of their Kings, who &s;aw de&s;cend from them the &s;ixth Generation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Production of the Soil.</NOTE>The Soil is very rich and fertile, producing naturally Walnuts, Grapes (of which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who are there Planted have made very good Wine) Apricocks, Bullys, with a multitude of others; be&s;ides the Woods al&s;o are full of very good Peaches, and all the Sea&s;on of the Year &s;trew'd all over with Strawberries. Mul|berry-Trees are the common growth of the Woods; and to a&s;&s;ure you they are the natural Offspring of the Place, and grow to an incredible bigne&s;s, one whereof the
<PB N="206" REF="126"><HI>Engli&s;h</HI> (who are new Planted at <HI>Albemarle Point</HI> on <HI>A&s;hley</HI> River) made u&s;e to fa&s;ten the Gate of their Palli&s;ado to, was &s;o large, that all who came from thence &s;ay, they never &s;aw any Oak in <HI>England</HI> bigger, which is but the ordinary &s;ize of the Mul|berry-Trees of this Countrey, which is &s;o &s;ure an Argument of the richne&s;s of the Soil, that the Inhabitants of <HI>Virginia</HI> enquiring of the Seamen who came from thence, concerning the Quality and Product of the Countrey, when they were in|form'd of the large Mulberry-Trees it produc'd, were &s;o well &s;atisfi'd with it, that they made no farther Enquiry. There are al&s;o other Trees, as A&s;h, Poplar, and Bay, with &s;everal &s;orts unknown to us of <HI>Europe;</HI> but tho&s;e which make it almo&s;t all one general Forre&s;t of large Timber-Trees, are Oak, both red and white, and Cedar. There are al&s;o here and there large Groves of Pine-Trees, &s;ome a hundred Foot high, which afford a better &s;ort of Ma&s;t than are to be had either in <HI>Mary-Land</HI> or <HI>Norway.</HI> The&s;e larger Trees weaving their luxuriant Branches into a clo&s;e Shade, &s;uffer no Under-wood to grow between them, either by their Droppings, or el&s;e the Heads of Deer which loo&s;ening all the tender Shoots, quite de&s;troy it; &s;o that a great part of the Countrey is as it were a va&s;t Forre&s;t of fine Walks, free from the heat of the Sun, or the incumbrance of Shrubs and Bu&s;hes, and &s;o clear and open, that a Man may ea&s;ily ride a Hunting among&s;t the Trees, yielding a Pro&s;pect very plea&s;ant and &s;urpa&s;&s;ing. On the Skirts of the&s;e Woods grow le&s;&s;er Trees and Shrubs of &s;everal &s;orts; among&s;t them are &s;undry Dying Materials, which how well the Inhabitants know how to make u&s;e of, appears in the Deer-Skins that the chief of them wear, which are Painted, or rather Dy'd, with &s;everal lively Colours. But among&s;t their Shrubs, one of mo&s;t note and u&s;e is that who&s;e Leaves make their <HI>Ca&s;ini,</HI> a Drink they frequently u&s;e, and affirm to be very advantageous for the pre|&s;ervation of Health; which, by the de&s;cription our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> give of the &s;ize, colour, and &s;hape of the Leaf, the &s;ort of Tree it grows on, and the ta&s;te, colour, and effects of the Drink, which is nothing but the Decoction of the Leaf, &s;eems to be the very &s;ame with the <HI>Ea&s;t-India TEE,</HI> and by tho&s;e who have &s;een and ta&s;ted both, af|firm'd to be no other, and may very probably be a &s;pontaneous and native Plant of this Place, &s;ince tho&s;e who give us an account of it, tell us, that this &s;o much valu'd Leaf grows mo&s;t plentifully in <HI>Nanking,</HI> a Province in <HI>China</HI> under the very &s;ame Latitude, and very much agreeing in Soil and Situation with this of <HI>Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>What Herbs el&s;e the Countrey produces, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Enquirers (who by minding their Plantations and Settlement there, have been taken off from &s;uch unprofitable Actions) give us but little account, onely they &s;ay, that tho&s;e Plats of Ground which have been formerly clear'd off by the <HI>Indians</HI> for the Planting their Corn, they found thick cover'd with three-leav'd Gra&s;s and Dazies, which the fertility of the Soil thru&s;ts forth, whenever the Natives remove their Tillage to &s;ome other place, and leave the Earth to its own production; and in other parts they found plenty of Garden Herbs growing wild. The low and Moori&s;h Grounds are for the mo&s;t part overgrown with Sedge and Reeds, and &s;uch other Tra&s;h, which u&s;u|ally incumbers rich and uncultivated Lands; tho&s;e they call <HI>Swam&s;as,</HI> which with a little Husbandry would prove very good Meadows. There are al&s;o &s;ome large and plea&s;ant <HI>Savanas,</HI> or gra&s;&s;y Plains.</P>
<P>The&s;e are a part of the Trees and Plants be&s;t known to us, that Nature of her &s;elf produces, in a Soil which contrives and nouri&s;hes any thing. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who are now Planted in the mo&s;t Northern parts of it, at <HI>Albemarle,</HI> bordering on <HI>Virgi|nia,</HI> have Apples, Pears, Cherries, Apricocks, Plumbs, and Water-Melons, equal|ling, and if you will believe the Inhabitants, both in largene&s;s of &s;ize and goodne&s;s of ta&s;te, exceeding any in <HI>Europe.</HI> And they who are Setled farther South on <HI>A&s;hley</HI>
<PB N="207" REF="126">River, have found that the Oranges, Lemmons, Pomegranates, Limes, Pome|citrons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which they Planted there, have thriven beyond expectation; and there is nothing which they have put into the Earth, that through any defect in the Soil, hath fail'd to pro&s;per.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Commodi|nes of the Countrey.</NOTE>Be&s;ides tho&s;e things which do &s;erve to &s;atisfie Hunger, or provoke it, the Land doth with great return produce Indigo, Ginger, Tobacco, Cotton, and other Com|modities fit to &s;end abroad and furni&s;h foreign Markets; and when a little time &s;hall have brought tho&s;e kind of Plants to maturity, and given the Inhabitants lei&s;ure to furni&s;h them&s;elves with Conveniences for ordering tho&s;e things aright, the Trials that they have already made of the Soil and its fitne&s;s for &s;uch Plan|tations, a&s;&s;ure you, that be&s;ides Silk, enough to &s;tore <HI>Europe,</HI> and a great many other con&s;iderable Commodities, they &s;hall have as great plenty of good Wine and Oyl, as any part of the World.</P>
<P>The Mould is generally black, mellow, and upon handling feels &s;oft, and (to u&s;e their Expre&s;&s;ion who have been there) &s;oapy, and is generally all over the Countrey ju&s;t like the fine Mould of our well order'd Gardens. Under this black Earth, which is of a good thickne&s;s in mo&s;t places that they have try'd, there lies a Bed of Marle, and in &s;ome parts Clay.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fi&s;h and Water-Fowl.</NOTE>The Rivers are &s;tor'd with plenty of excellent Fi&s;h of &s;everal &s;orts, which are ta|ken with great ea&s;e in abundance, and are one great part of the Natives Provi&s;ion, who are never like to want this Recruit, in a Countrey &s;o abounding in large Ri|vers, there being in that one &s;mall Tract between <HI>Port Ra&s;al</HI> and <HI>Cape Carteret,</HI> which are not one Degree di&s;tant, five or &s;ix great Navigable Rivers, that empty them&s;elves into the Sea. The&s;e Rivers are al&s;o cover'd with Flocks of Ducks and Mallard, whereof millions are &s;een together, be&s;ides Cranes, Herons, Gee&s;e, Cur|lews, and other Water-Fowl, who are &s;o ea&s;ie to be kill'd, that onely ri&s;ing at the di&s;charge and noi&s;e of a Gun, they in&s;tantly light again in the &s;ame place, and pre|&s;ently offer a fre&s;h Mark to the Fowler. At the Mouths of the Rivers, and along the Sea-Coa&s;t, are Beds of Oy&s;ters, which are of a longer Make than tho&s;e in <HI>Europe,</HI> but very well ta&s;ted, wherein are often found good large Pearls, which though the unskilful <HI>Indians</HI> by wa&s;hing the Oy&s;ters do commonly di&s;colour, and &s;poil their lu&s;tre, yet 'tis not to be doubted, but if rightly order'd, there will be found many of value, and the Fi&s;hing for them turn to &s;ome account.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the ea&s;ie Provi&s;ions which the Rivers and Sea afford, their Woods are well &s;tock'd with Deer, Rabbets, Hares, Turtle-Doves, Phe&s;ants, Partridges, and an infinite number of Wood-Pigeons and wild Turkies, which are the ordinary Di&s;hes of the <HI>Indians,</HI> who&s;e Hou&s;e-keeping depends on their Fi&s;hing and Hunting, and who have found it no ill way of Living in &s;o fertile a Countrey, to tru&s;t them|&s;elves without any labor or foreca&s;t, to the Supplies which are there provided to their hands, without the continual trouble of Tillage and Husbandry. Be&s;ides, the&s;e Woods are fill'd with innumerable variety of &s;maller Birds, as different in their Notes as Kinds.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Temperatine of the Cl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|mate.</NOTE>The Temperature of this Province is agreeable to a Countrey, who&s;e Po&s;ition is on the warmer &s;ide of the temperate <HI>Zone,</HI> but yet the Heat is not &s;o &s;ultry nor offen&s;ive, as in Places under the &s;ame Latitude in the <HI>Old World;</HI> to which modera|tion of Heat, as well as the healthine&s;s of it, the va&s;t <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean, lying to the Ea&s;t and South of it, may perhaps not a little contribute, an in&s;tance whereof &s;ome think <HI>China</HI> to be; to which de&s;ervedly admir'd Countrey <HI>Carolina</HI> exactly an|&s;wers in its Po&s;ition and Latitude, the trending from North-Ea&s;t to South-We&s;t of its Coa&s;t, and the lowne&s;s of its Shore, and wants nothing but Inhabitants, to
<PB N="208" REF="127">make it equal, if not excell, in all conveniences of Life, as it doth in richne&s;s of Soil, that flouri&s;hing Empire. The healthine&s;s of the Air is &s;uch, that it is not onely benign and favorable to the home-bred <HI>Indians,</HI> and Con&s;titutions accu&s;tom'd to it, but the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-men who fir&s;t Planted on <HI>A&s;hley</HI> River, though for &s;ome other Conveniences they Planted on the &s;ide, or almo&s;t middle of a Mora&s;s, and were en|compa&s;s'd with a &s;alt Mar&s;h, where the Air, pent up with Woods that &s;urrounded them, had not that freedom it hath in open and cultivated Countreys, yet lo&s;t not in a whole years time, of a con&s;iderable number, any one Per&s;on, of any Di&s;ea&s;e to be imputed to the Countrey, tho&s;e few that dy'd in that time &s;inking under lin|gring Di&s;tempers which they brought with them, and had almo&s;t worn them out before they came thither. The <HI>Bermudians</HI> (who being accu&s;tom'd to the pure Air of their own I&s;land, cannot without hazard of their Lives put them&s;elves into any other Place) a&s;&s;ur'd of the healthine&s;s of this Place, which is the next Land to them, and under the &s;ame Latitude, venture hither. And generally all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Planting in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> are &s;o taken with the Conveniences of this Countrey, which, as &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in tho&s;e Parts &s;ay of it, pro|mi&s;es all that the Heart of Man can wi&s;h, that they &s;end the overplus of their Peo|ple hither; to which the Inhabitants of <HI>Barbados,</HI> a skilful and wary &s;ort of Plan|ters, well knowing in all the parts of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> have been found to remove the Hands they could &s;pare. As the Summer is not intolerably nor offen&s;ively hot, &s;o the Winter is not trouble&s;om nor pinching, but enough to correct the Humors of Mens Bodies, the better to &s;trengthen them, and pre&s;erve their Healths; and &s;o far to check the growth of Plants, that by this &s;top they may put out more regularly, and the Corn and other Fruits the better ripen together, and be ready &s;ea&s;onably at the Harve&s;t, the want whereof in &s;ome Countreys hinders the beneficial Growth of &s;everal valuable Commodities, the continual Spring all the year long making that their Crops are never ready, their Trees being laden with green and ripe Fruit at the &s;ame time, which is to be &s;een in the Vines growing between the <HI>Tropicks,</HI> where, though they bear excellent Grapes, yet they cannot make any Wine, while&s;t the mixture of ripe and &s;owre Grapes upon the &s;ame Branch, renders them unfit for the Pre&s;s, which from Grapes &s;o blended, though of a good kind, would &s;queeze out a very crude and u&s;ele&s;s Liquor. This al&s;o is the rea&s;on why many Parts where our Wheat will grow very well, do yet lo&s;e the benefit of it, while&s;t the &s;e|veral Ears ripening unequally, never make the Crop fit for the Sickle. But this Countrey hath Winter enough to remove that Inconvenience, and to put &s;uch a &s;top to the Ri&s;e of the Sap, and the Budding of Plants, as to make the &s;everal kinds of Fruits Bud and Blo&s;&s;om in their di&s;tinct Sea&s;ons, and keep even pace till they are fit to be gather'd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature, Con|&s;titutions, and Manners of the Inhabi|tants.</NOTE>To this happy Climate the native Inhabitants are very well &s;uited, a &s;trong, lu&s;ty, and well &s;hap'd People, who to their well knit and active Bodies, want not &s;tout and vigorous Minds; they are a People of a good Under&s;tanding, well Hu|mor'd, and generally &s;o ju&s;t and Hone&s;t, that they may &s;eem to have no notice of, as their Language hath no word for, Di&s;hone&s;ty and Cheating; and the wor&s;t Name they have for ill Men is, that they are not good. They are a &s;tout and va|liant People, which appears in the con&s;tant Wars they are engag'd in, not out of covetou&s;ne&s;s, and a de&s;ire of u&s;urping others Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, or to enrich them&s;elves by the Spoils of their Neighbors, but upon a pitch of Honor, and for the glory of Vi|ctory, which is their greate&s;t joy, there being no parts of their Lives wherein they enjoy &s;o much &s;atisfaction, and give them&s;elves &s;o wholly to Jollity, as in their Triumphs after Victory. Valor therefore is the Vertue they mo&s;t e&s;teem and
<PB N="209" REF="127">reward, and he which hath behav'd him&s;elf well in the Wars, is &s;uffer'd to wear the Badges of Honor, and is advanc'd beyond others with &s;ome Marks of his Courage; which among&s;t &s;ome is blacking the Skin below his Eyes, with black Lead, in fa&s;hion &s;omething of an Half-Moon; which Mark of Courage is, not &s;uf|fer'd to be worn by any, but tho&s;e who by &s;ome brave Action, as killing the Ene|my's Leader, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> hath &s;ignaliz'd him&s;elf in their Encounters. They are faithful to their Promi&s;es, fair and candid in their Dealings, and &s;o far from Di&s;hone&s;ty, that they want even the Seeds of it, <HI>viz.</HI> Foreca&s;t and Covetou&s;ne&s;s; and he will be very little apt to deceive you to Day, who troubles not him&s;elf much about to Morrow, and tru&s;ts for the Provi&s;ions of the Day to the Day it &s;elf; which pro|ceeds not in them for want of Wit, but de&s;ire of Content and Quiet, or by the help of their natural Rea&s;on they enjoy that Happine&s;s which the Philo&s;ophers could not by their Study and Reading attain to, while&s;t the&s;e Men cut off tho&s;e De&s;ires which Learning could never help the other to Govern, and which if once permit|ted to run out beyond the pre&s;ent, are capable of no re&s;t nor Bounds. In their Conver&s;ation they are courteous and civil, and in their Vi&s;its make Pre&s;ents to one another; when they meet, their way of Salutation is &s;troaking on the Shoulders, and &s;ucking in their Breath; and if he be a great Man whom they Salute, they &s;troak his Thighs too; as civil an Addre&s;s, as tho&s;e Patterns of good Breeding, the Hero's, us'd to their Princes, who in their greate&s;t Court&s;hips, we are told, em|brac'd their Knees: After their Salutation they &s;it down; and it is u&s;ual with them to &s;it &s;till almo&s;t a quarter of an hour before they &s;peak, which is not an effect of &s;tupidity or &s;ullenne&s;s, but the accu&s;tom'd Gravity of their Countrey; for they are in their Tempers a merry, frollick, gay People, and &s;o given to Jollity, that they will Dance whole Nights together, the Women &s;itting by and Singing, while&s;t the Men Dance to their Ayrs, which though not like ours, are not har&s;h or unplea|&s;ing, but are &s;omething like the Tunes of the <HI>Iri&s;h:</HI> So that if we will not let our &s;elves too fondly admire onely the Cu&s;toms we have been bred up in, nor think Men are to be valu'd for making Legs after our Mode, or the Clothes they wear, which, the finer and gayer they are, always the more to be &s;u&s;pected of Luxury and Effeminatene&s;s; if we will allow but the&s;e Men to follow the Garbs of their own Countrey, and think them fine enough in a &s;hape onely to hide their Nakedne&s;s before, or a Deer-skin hanging loo&s;ely on their Shoulders, and their Women not ill Dre&s;s'd in Garments of Mo&s;s, and Necklaces of Beads, while&s;t the Fa&s;hion of their Courts require no other Ornaments; if, I &s;ay, a long and plea&s;ant Life, without Di&s;temper or Care, be to be valu'd, without the incumbrance of unne|ce&s;&s;ary Trinkets; if Men are to be e&s;teem'd for Valor, Hone&s;ty, Friend&s;hip, Hu|manity and good Nature, though Strangers to the ceremonious Troubles we are accu&s;tom'd to, the Natives of <HI>Carolina</HI> will as little, or perhaps le&s;s, de&s;erve the Name of <HI>Mi&s;erable,</HI> or <HI>Salvage,</HI> as tho&s;e that give it them. 'Tis true, the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> who have Planted among&s;t them, or with little Armies travell'd their Countrey, have been ill handled by them; but yet the <HI>Indians</HI> never did them any harm, or treated them otherwi&s;e than Friends, till tho&s;e <HI>Europeans</HI> by their breach of Faith and &s;everal Outrages, had provok'd their ju&s;t Revenge; and they did nothing but what mo&s;t vertuous and generous &s;ort of Men are apt to do, to revenge tho&s;e Affronts, which did not agree with their Tempers tamely to endure. That this did not proceed from treachery and incon&s;tancy in their Natures, is apparent in the contrary Corre&s;pondence they have had with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Setled among&s;t them, to whom they have been all along very kind, as they were at fir&s;t very cove|tous of their Company; for after that &s;ome of their King's Relation had been at
<PB N="210" REF="128"><HI>Barbados,</HI> and had &s;een and admir'd the Temper, Fa&s;hions, and Strength of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> there, and had been very civilly Treated in that I&s;land, they were &s;o well &s;atisfi'd with them, that at the coming of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to Settle there, the &s;everal little Kingdoms &s;trove with all the Arts and Arguments they could u&s;e, each of them to draw the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to Plant in their Dominions, by commending the richne&s;s of their Soil, conveniency of their Rivers, the healthine&s;s of their Countrey, the di&s;parage|ment of their Neighbors, and whatever el&s;e they judg'd might allure the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to their Neighborhood. Nor was this onely the fir&s;t heat of Men fond of Novelties, and as &s;oon weary of them again, but ever &s;ince the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fir&s;t Planted at <HI>Albemarle Point,</HI> on <HI>A&s;hley</HI> River, they have continu'd to do them all manner of friendly Of|fices, ready on all occa&s;ions to &s;upply them with any thing they have ob&s;erv'd them to want, not making u&s;e of our Mens Nece&s;&s;ities, as an opportunity to en|hance the Price of their Commodities, a &s;ort of fair Dealing we could &s;carce have promis'd them among&s;t civiliz'd, well bred, and religious Inhabitants of any part of <HI>Europe;</HI> and though they are much frighted with our Guns, both &s;mall and great, yet like innocent and well-meaning People, they do not at all di&s;tru&s;t our Power, but freely, without &s;u&s;picion, tru&s;t them&s;elves, both Men and Women, even their Kings them&s;elves, in our Town, Lodging and Dancing there frequently whole Nights together, upon no other Pledges but the bare confidence of our mutual Friend&s;hip; nor do our Men u&s;e any greater caution in Conver&s;ing with them, &s;tragling up and down, and travelling &s;ingly and unarm'd through their Woods for many Miles about, and are &s;o far from receiving any injury or ill treatment from them, that on the contrary they are kindly us'd and Entertain'd, and guided by them in their Way whenever they de&s;ire it; and when any of our Men meet them in their Walks, the <HI>Indians</HI> all &s;tand &s;till till they are gone by, civilly Salu|ting them as they pa&s;s. Nor doth this A&s;&s;urance of theirs bound it &s;elf within their own Homes, they of their own accords venturing them&s;elves aboard our Ships, have gone voluntarily with our Men to <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Barbados.</HI> Nor have the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> been wanting on their parts in any thing that may pre&s;erve this Amity, being ve|ry cautious of doing them any injury, bartering with them for tho&s;e things they receive of them, and buying of them even the wa&s;te Land they make no u&s;e of.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the &s;implicity of the <HI>Indians</HI> Diet, it is very remarkable, that they have a general aver&s;ion to tho&s;e two things which are mo&s;t acceptable to our Palates, and without which few of us either eat or drink with any delight; for in their Meats they cannot endure the lea&s;t mixture or relli&s;h of Salt; and for their Drink, they utterly abominate all manner of &s;trong Liquor; to the latter whereof, their large Growth and con&s;tant Health, is perhaps not a little owing.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of Govern|ment.</NOTE>Every little Town is a di&s;tinct Principality, Govern'd by an Hereditary King, who in &s;ome places is not Son, but Si&s;ters Son to the precedent King, the Succe&s;|&s;ion of the Blood-Royal being continu'd by the &s;afer &s;ide.

<P>The Lords-Proprietors of this Countrey, for the better Settlement of it accord|ing to their Patent granted unto them by His Maje&s;ty, and for the enlargement of the King's Dominions in tho&s;e parts of <HI>America,</HI> have been at great Charge to &s;ecure this &s;o rich and advantageous a Countrey to the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> to whom of an|cient Right, by the Di&s;covery of Sir <HI>Seba&s;tian Cabott</HI> in the time of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, it doth belong, and for its Situation, Fertility, Neighborhood to our other Plantati|ons and &s;everal other Conveniences, of too valuable con&s;ideration to be negligently lo&s;t: By the Care therefore and Endeavors of tho&s;e Great Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their care for Setling and Impro|ving of this Plantation.</NOTE> it hath now two con&s;iderable Colonies Planted in it, the one of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> on the North &s;ide, border|ing on <HI>Virginia,</HI> where are &s;ome hundreds of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Families remov'd thither from <HI>New England,</HI> and &s;ome of our other Plantations in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies;</HI> and ano|ther towards the middle of the Countrey, at <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> or <HI>A&s;hley-River,</HI> a Settle|ment &s;o hopeful, for the healthine&s;s of the Land, and convenience of acce&s;s by a large deep Navigable River, and &s;o promi&s;ing in its very Infancy, that many of the rich Inhabitants of <HI>Barbados</HI> and <HI>Bermudas,</HI> who are now crowded up in tho&s;e flouri&s;hing I&s;lands, and many in our other <HI>American</HI> Plantations, are turning their Eyes and Thoughts this way, and have already remov'd part of their Stock and Servants thither.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fair Terms propos'd to whom&s;oever &s;hall remove thither.</NOTE>The Lords-Proprietors, for the comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and future enrichment of all tho&s;e who &s;hall this Year 1671.

But though the&s;e Conditions are very advantageous, and the Countrey promi&s;es to the Planter Health, Plenty and Riches at a cheap Rate, yet there is one thing that makes this Plantation more valuable than all the&s;e, and that is the &s;ecure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the&s;e
<PB N="212" REF="129">things with as great certainty as the &s;tate of humane Affairs, and the tran&s;ient things of this Life are capable of, in a well continu'd Form of Government, wherein it is made every Man's Intere&s;t to pre|&s;erve the Rights of his Neighbor with his own; and tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t Power, have it limi|ted to the Service of the Countrey, the Good and Welfare whereof while&s;t they pre&s;erve and pro|mote, they cannot mi&s;s of their own, the Lords.

<P>With this De&s;ign the Lords-Proprietors, who are at great Charge for carrying on this Plantation, have put the framing of a Government into the Hands of one, who&s;e Parts and Experience in Affairs of State are univer&s;ally agreed on, and who is by all Men allow'd to know what is convenient for the right ordering Men in Society, and &s;etling a Government upon &s;uch Foundations, as may be equal, &s;afe, and la&s;ting; and to this hath a Soul large enough to wi&s;h well to Mankind, and to de&s;ire, that all the People where he hath to do might be happy. My Lord <HI>A&s;hley</HI> therefore, by the con&s;ent of his Bre|thren, the re&s;t of the Lords Proprietors, hath drawn up, to their general &s;atisfaction, &s;ome funda|mental Con&s;titutions, which are &s;ince, by their joynt approbation, confirm'd to be the Model and Form of Government in the Province of <HI>Carolina;</HI> the main De&s;ign and Ballance thereof (accord|ing to the be&s;t of my memory, having had a Copy thereof) in &s;hort is as followeth:</P>
<P N="1"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Model drawn up by the Lord <HI>A&s;h|ley</HI> for the Government of <HI>Carolina.</HI></NOTE>1. EVery County is to con&s;i&s;t of forty &s;quare Plots, each containing twelve thou&s;and Acres. Of the&s;e &s;quare Plots each of the Proprietors is to have one, which is to be call'd a <HI>Signiory.</HI> Eight more of the&s;e &s;quare Plots are to be divided among&s;t the three Noble-men of that County, <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI>Landgrave,</HI> who is to have four of them; and two <HI>Ca&s;iques,</HI> who are to have each of them two apiece; and the&s;e &s;quare Plots belonging to the Nobility, are to be call'd <HI>Baronies.</HI> The other twenty four &s;quare Plots, call'd <HI>Colonies,</HI> are to be the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the People: And this Method is to be ob|&s;erv'd in the Planting and Setting out of the whole Countrey; &s;o that one Fifth of the Land is to be in the Proprietors, one Fifth in the Nobility, and three Fifths in the People,</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Signories</HI> and <HI>Baronies,</HI> that is, the hereditary Lands belonging to the Proprietors and Nobi|lity, are all entirely to de&s;cend to their Heirs, with the Dignity, without power of alienation, more than for three Lives, or one and twenty years, or two Thirds of their <HI>Signiories</HI> and <HI>Baronies,</HI> and the re&s;t to be <HI>Deme&s;ne.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. There will be al&s;o &s;ome Mannors in the Colonies, but none le&s;s than three thou&s;and Acres in a Piece, which, like the re&s;t of the Colony Lands, will be alienable, onely with this difference, that it cannot be parcell'd out, but if fold, it mu&s;t be altogether.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is to be a Biennial Parliament, con&s;i&s;ting of the eight Proprietors, the <HI>Landgraves</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;iques,</HI> and one out of every Precinct, that is the &s;ix neighboring Colonies, for the People, cho&s;en by the Freeholders; the&s;e are to &s;it and Vote altogether for the making of Laws, which &s;hall be in force no longer than &s;ixty years after their Enacting, the great mi&s;chief of mo&s;t Governments, by which not onely the People are mightily entangled by multiplicity of Rules and Penalties, and thereby laid open to the Malice and De&s;igns of trouble&s;om Men and cunning Projectors; but, which is far wor&s;e, the whole frame of the Government in tract of time comes to be remov'd from its origi|nal Foundation, and thereby becomes more weak and tottering.</P>
<P N="5">5. There are eight &s;upream Courts for the di&s;patch of all publick Affairs; the fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ts of the <HI>Palatine,</HI> who is the elde&s;t of the Proprietors, and hath power to call Parliaments, and di&s;po&s;e of publick Offices. The other &s;even &s;upream Courts are, 1. The chief Ju&s;tices for the determining of Controver&s;ies of <HI>Meunt</HI> and <HI>Tuum,</HI> and judging of Criminals. 2. The Chancellors, for pa&s;&s;ing of Char|ters, and managing the State Matters of the Province. 3. The High-Con&s;tables, for Military Affairs. 4. The Admirals, for Maritime Affairs. 5. The High-Stewards, for Trade. 6. The Trea&s;urers, for the publick Stock; and 7. The Chamberlains, for Ceremonies, Fa&s;hions, Marriages, Burials, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e are the &s;even &s;upream Courts, to whom lies the ultimate Appeal in all Cau&s;es belonging to them. Each of the&s;e Courts con&s;i&s;ts of one Proprietor, and &s;ix other Councellors, whereof two are cho&s;en by the Nobility, and two by the People. All the number of the&s;e eight Courts joyn'd together make the Grand Council, which are in the nature of a Council of State, and are entru&s;ted with the ma|nagement of Affairs of greate&s;t concernment. There is al&s;o in every County a Court, and in every Precinct another; from the Precinct Court there lies an Appeal to the County Court, and from the County Court to the Proprietors Court, to which the Matter in que&s;tion belongs, and there is the la&s;t deci&s;ion and determination thereof, without any farther Appeal. And to keep the People from the Charges and vexation of long Suits, to the enriching of Men cunning in Words, care is taken, that no Cau&s;e &s;hall be Try'd more than once in any one Court, and that profe&s;s'd Pleaders for Money &s;hall not be allow'd.</P>
<P><HI>Liberty of Con&s;cience</HI> is here al&s;o allow'd in the greate&s;t latitude, but yet &s;o, that neither Athei&s;ts, or Men of no Religion, are permitted; Athei&s;m, Irreligion, and vicious Lives being condemn'd, as di&s;agreeable to humane Nature, incon&s;i&s;tent with Government and Societies, and de&s;tructive to all that is u&s;eful to, or becoming of Mankind; as on the other hand, rigorous Impo&s;ing of, and hot Contentions about the Ceremonies and Circum&s;tances of Religion, is an occa&s;ion of perpetual Strife, Faction and Divi&s;ion, keeps Men from &s;edate and temperate Enquiries after Truth, eats out the great Cement of humane Conver&s;ation, <HI>Charity,</HI> and cannot be found in any one, who hath but mode&s;ty enough to think him&s;elf le&s;s than a <HI>Pope,</HI> and &s;hort of <HI>Infallibility.</HI></P>
<P>There is al&s;o to be a Regi&s;ter of all Grants and Conveyances of Land, to prevent even the occa&s;i|ons of Controver&s;ies and Law-Suits.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal other le&s;s con&s;iderable Particulars in this Government, all contriv'd and de|&s;ign'd for the good and welfare of the People; all which are &s;o well put together, and in &s;uch equal proportion ballance each other, that &s;ome judicious Men who have &s;een it, &s;ay, it is the be&s;t and faire&s;t Frame, for the well-being of tho&s;e who &s;hall live under it, of any they have &s;een or read of.</P>

<P>The fre&s;h Water which they have in the City <HI>Mexico,</HI> is led into the &s;ame through Pipes that lie in the bottom of the Lake; but none are to enjoy the benefit thereof, before they have paid a certain Sum of Money to the King's Collectors.</P>
<P>Moreover, the City divided into I&s;lands, contains above &s;ixty thou&s;and Hou&s;es, which being built on &s;everal I&s;les, have large Bridges, which reach from one to ano|ther; &s;ome that lie in the middle of the Lake, they approach in little Boats; round about the Lake, e&s;pecially where the way leads from the Continent into the City, lie &s;everal Suburbs, all inclos'd with Walls; between which &s;tand &s;trong Towers, cover'd on the top: To keep off the force of the Water, the <HI>Tenu&s;tatans</HI> have with great labor and charge, made a Bank through the Lake, half way along the City: But the Lake <HI>Laguna,</HI> from who&s;e bottom <HI>Mexico</HI> is rais'd, is divided in two parts, the <HI>Sweet Lake,</HI> which is higher than the <HI>Salt,</HI> falls in to the &s;ame through Sluces, with Bridges built on the Bank that leads from the City to the main Land: The <HI>Salt-Lake,</HI> which hath bracki&s;h and bitter Water, ebbs and flows according as the Wind blows; no Fi&s;h is able to live in the &s;ame, becau&s;e the Water which in the &s;ight of <HI>Mexico</HI> falls into the &s;ame out of the Mountains, hath a &s;ulphury Ground: All along the &s;hore, much Salt is made, with which the Citizens drive a great Trade: There are continually above a hundred thou&s;and Boats (by the <HI>Indians</HI> call'd <HI>Acales,</HI> and by the <HI>Spaniards, Canoos</HI>) going off and on from one &s;hore to another: The fre&s;h Water Lake, which is bigger than the &s;alt, and feeds &s;mall Fi&s;hes, hath above fif|ty

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tempe|rature of the Air.</NOTE>The Air in this place is very &s;trange; in the day time, the Sky is generally Se|rene; the North Wind again&s;t the Evening brings Rain, of which the Mountain <HI>Tepeaquilla</HI> lying a little League beyond the City, gives certain Te&s;timonies; for when a black Cloud appears on the top thereof, it is certain to be blown from thence over <HI>Mexico</HI> with Rain: After a moi&s;t Evening follows a Star-light Night, and a plea&s;ant Morning: From <HI>September</HI> till <HI>May,</HI> it is generally dry Weather here, but if it chances to Rain&punc; the Rain is attended with a Storm, which occa&s;ions a &s;ulphurous Fogg, very unwhol&s;om, and &s;o dark, that one Man cannot di|&s;cern another, and cau&s;es a pain through all the Limbs, nay &s;ometimes Death it &s;elf; wherefore, when &s;oe're it approaches, every one keeps clo&s;e in his Hou&s;e, or goes into the Countrey.</P>

The Soil, by rea&s;on of the Climate, would be a little inclining to Drought, but that, be&s;ides the frequent Rains which it hath, it is con&s;tantly moi&s;tned with fre&s;h Morning Dews, which make it for the mo&s;t part wonderfully fruitful, almo&s;t beyond belief, yield|ing for every Pu&s;hel of Wheat that is &s;own, three&s;core; and of <HI>Maiz,</HI> two hundred for one; be&s;ides great plenty of Sugar-Canes and <HI>Cochinele;</HI> both which neverthe|le&s;s the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are &s;aid to neglect in &s;ome &s;ort, employing them&s;elves wholly about richer Commodities: for the Countrey affords them good &s;tore of Mines of Silver and Bra&s;s, but of Gold or Iron, not many as yet have been found. The Ri|vers abound plentifully with Fi&s;h, and the Woods with Weni&s;on, and &s;ome other wild Bea&s;ts. The Countrey is generally more mountainous than plain, frequently &s;haded with Woods, and whole Forre&s;ts of the &s;tatelie&s;t Pine-Trees and Oaks that are to be &s;een; among&s;t which breed abundance of Wolves, which do great mi&s;|chief to the People, as al&s;o Scorpions and <HI>Mu&s;tiecho's.</HI> The Hurts receiv'd from Scorpions, are heal'd with the Juice of the Fruit call'd <HI>Queon;</HI> tho&s;e from the <HI>Mu|&s;tiecho's,</HI> by Vinegar and the Juice of Lemmon.

<P>The fourth &s;ort hath a &s;traight Body full of Prickles, runs le&s;&s;er and le&s;&s;er to the top; at the end of the &s;mall Boughs, each thick Leaf produces another; the Wood, if kindled, burns like a Candle.</P>

Great Rivers with come out of the North, and others that di&s;embogu'd into the North Sea, af|forded them all &s;orts of Fi&s;h; as al&s;o the Woods plenty of Veni&s;on, Fowls, and whol&s;om Plants. In &s;ome Pools al&s;o the &s;alt Water afforded Salt.</P>
<P>The Valour of the Inhabitants may &s;ufficiently appear by the rough Entertain|ment which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> met withall the fir&s;t Night; for the <HI>Patarabueyes</HI> fell &s;o fiercely upon them, that had not the Watch given notice thereof in time, none had e&s;cap'd with Life; neverthele&s;s five Hor&s;es were kill'd, and a con&s;iderable num|ber of Men wounded: after which retreating, they went upon a neighboring Hill, whither <HI>Espejus</HI> &s;ent his Interpreter, and an <HI>Indian</HI> the &s;ame Countrey, to inform them, That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came not to mole&s;t them, and if they pleas'd to come to them, they &s;hould meet with none but Friends; which was the more ea&s;ily credi|ted, becau&s;e the <HI>Ca&s;iques</HI> receiv'd &s;ome Pre&s;ents; after which being reconcild, they conducted the <HI>Spaniards</HI> twelve days Journey up a long River, who&s;e Banks were inhabited in &s;everal places. from thence they reach'd to a Place, inhabited by a People richly Cloth'd, who al&s;o &s;eem'd to have &s;ome knowledge of God; for in
<PB N="293" REF="185">their Di&s;cour&s;e they pointed up to Heaven, call'd the Creator and Pre&s;erver of all things <HI>Apalito,</HI> and &s;ignifi'd that they had receiv'd that Knowledge formerly from tho&s;e that were left of <HI>Pamphilius Narvaez</HI>'s Army, who having rang'd through <HI>Florida</HI> were driven hither.</P>
<P>The&s;e People al&s;o Pre&s;ented <HI>E&s;pejus</HI> many tann'd Skins, with which he went to a great Village, the Inhabitants whereof were very courteous, and barter'd them for brave Plumes of Feathers and Cotton Cloaks, &s;treak'd with blue and white: but <HI>E&s;pejus</HI> having no Interpreters whom they could under&s;tand, could not learn by what Name they were known; yet by &s;igns they expre&s;s'd what time of the year they had Precious Stones brought to them; and al&s;o what their Countrey produ|ced; and al&s;o that abundance of tho&s;e Riches was to be found in a Province about five days Journey We&s;tward from thence, whither they freely offer'd to conduct the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which accordingly they did, bearing them company one and twenty Leagues to the next Province, inhabited by a People who&s;e Name al&s;o they could not be inform'd of, yet &s;taying three days among&s;t them, they were Entertain'd with Pre&s;ents and Dances both Night and Day. The Countrey afforded them al&s;o &s;tore of Veni&s;on and Fruits: Tho&s;e that under&s;tood Minerals, judg'd that there were likewi&s;e &s;everal Gold Mines.</P>
<P>Leaving this Province, they entred into a great Wilderne&s;s of Pine-Trees, in which they travell'd twelve Leagues in fifteen days, without &s;eeing either Man or Hou&s;e; but at the end of the Wood they &s;py'd a Village of Straw Huts, where there were great quantities of white Salt, and Deer Skins neatly dre&s;s'd. The Peo|ple of the Place courteou&s;ly Entertain'd the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and conducted them along the River <HI>Del Norte,</HI> to <HI>New Mexico:</HI> The Banks of the River on each &s;ide was plan|ted with Nut-Trees and Vines, which &s;pread them&s;elves out above three Leagues; through which they had &s;carce pa&s;s'd three days together, when they &s;aw ten Po|pulous Villages plea&s;antly &s;eated on the the &s;aid River, from whence came many thou|&s;ands of the Natives to meet <HI>E&s;pejus,</HI> who was not &s;o much amaz'd at the great number of People, as at their extraordinary Civility and decent Habits; for they Entertain'd him with well dre&s;s'd Meat, roa&s;ted Poultrey, and plea&s;ant Fruits: Their Garments were Cotton Cloaks, Deer-skin Breeches, Shoes and Boots of good Leather. The Women wore their Hair neatly Comb'd and Pleited. Their Hou&s;es were almo&s;t four Stories high, hand&s;omely built, and divided into fair Chambers, had Stoves or Cells under Ground again&s;t the Cold in the Winter. Every Village was Govern'd by a <HI>Ca&s;ique,</HI> who&s;e Commands were publi&s;h'd by the <HI>Alguaziles.</HI> Each Hou&s;e had a peculiar place in which their Idol &s;tood, before whom they &s;et Meat twice a day. Near the High-ways &s;tood Temples very curiou&s;ly painted, wherein their Deity, as they &s;ay, diverted him&s;elf in his Progre&s;s from one Village to ano|ther. At certain Di&s;tances near their Plough'd Lands, &s;tood <HI>Portico's,</HI> &s;upported on four Columns, under which the Husband-man us'd to eat, and take his Noon-&s;leep. Be&s;ides their Swords, which were &s;trong enough to cut a Man through the Middle, they us'd Bowes and Arrows: Their Shields were made of Deer Skins.</P>
<P><HI>E&s;pejus</HI> having &s;tay'd here four days, went to the Province <HI>De las Tiguas,</HI> which had &s;ixteen Villages; in the chiefe&s;t whereof, call'd <HI>Poala, Augu&s;tine Ruyz</HI> and his Brother Monk <HI>Franci&s;cus de Lopez</HI> had been &s;lain, be&s;ides four others; wherefore the People being con&s;cious of this Crime, and fearing that Revenge would follow, fled to the Mountains, from whence they could not be enticed, whil&s;t the <HI>Spaniards</HI> found their Hou&s;es full of Provi&s;ions and &s;ome Minerals.</P>
<P>Now tho&s;e being dead whom they &s;ought for, &s;ome though it convenient to re|turn; but <HI>E&s;pejus</HI> and <HI>Beltran</HI> per&s;waded the contrary, alledging, That farther up,

<P>Of the like Con&s;titution were the Inhabitants <HI>De los Amires,</HI> which being thirty thou&s;and in number, re&s;ided in &s;even well built Villages, lying North-We&s;t from <HI>Cunames.</HI></P>
<P>After this they march'd We&s;tward, and found the eminent Village <HI>Acoma,</HI> men|tion'd before, built on an exceeding high Rock, to which led onely a narrow Path up a pair of Stairs cut in the Rock; as al&s;o many Wells to receive Rain, be&s;ides what they have out of a River, led by moats round about their Plough'd Lands.

<P>From hence travelling twenty four Leagues more We&s;terly, they entred the Pro|vince of <HI>Zuny;</HI> where the erected Cro&s;&s;es which had remain'd there till that time, were &s;ufficient te&s;timonies of <HI>Cornaro</HI>'s having been there, after he was de&s;erted by <HI>Andreas de Cuyocan.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fir&s;t original of the <HI>New Mexicans.</HI></NOTE>The mo&s;t ancient Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of that part of <HI>Northern America</HI> call'd <HI>New Spain,</HI> were for their fierce and &s;alvage Nature call'd <HI>Chichimecae,</HI> who dwelling in Caves, fed on Moles, Rabbets, Hedghogs, Serpents, Roots and Herbs. Whil&s;t the Women accompanied their Husbands in their Travels, the Children were put into Baskets, and hang'd in a Tree. No manner of Government was to be found among&s;t them. They never Till'd their Ground till the <HI>Navatlacans</HI> came from <HI>New Mexico</HI> (which was anciently divided into two Countreys, <HI>Aztlan</HI> and <HI>Teuculhuacan</HI>) to <HI>New Spain;</HI> after which they Sow'd their Lands.</P>
<P>The <HI>Navatlacans</HI> (who us'd to dwell in Hou&s;es, wor&s;hip Images, plough their Lands, and obey their Governors) were divided into &s;ix Tribes, each Tribe po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing their limited Bounds: and there goes a Tradition, That out of &s;ix Pits that are to be &s;een in <HI>New Mexico,</HI> the <HI>Navatlacans</HI> had their original. The time when they de&s;erted <HI>New Mexico,</HI> as their mo&s;t authentick Hi&s;tories or Records declare, was (according to our computation) <HI>Anno</HI> 940. and they farther affirm, that they &s;pent forty years in a Journey, which might have been travell'd in a Moneth: The rea&s;on of which tediou&s;ne&s;s was, becau&s;e they re&s;ted in all places where they found a fruitful Countrey; but as they had advice from their diabolical Spirits, which (as they &s;ay) appear'd vi&s;ibly to them, they &s;till went on farther and farther, yet left behind tho&s;e that were aged, &s;ick, and decrepid, building convenient Hou&s;es for them, and appointing Over&s;eers to look after them. The Ruins of the Hou&s;es are yet to be &s;een on the Way along which they pa&s;s'd.</P>
<P>The &s;ix Tribes divided them&s;elves after this manner: Four of them &s;etled round about the great Lake of <HI>Mexico.</HI> The <HI>Sichumilans</HI> taking the South part, built, be&s;ides two other Towns, a Metropolis of their own Name, as the <HI>Chalcans</HI> on the North. The <HI>Tapunecans</HI> built <HI>Azcapuzalco</HI> in the We&s;t, which &s;ignifies <HI>A Pi&s;mires Hole,</HI> becau&s;e of the abundance of Inhabitants. The Ea&s;tern part was taken up by the <HI>Chalhuans.</HI> And all the&s;e Names have a peculiar &s;ignification; the fir&s;t &s;ignifies <HI>People of Flowry Fields;</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>People of Mouthes;</HI> the third, <HI>People of Bridges;</HI> and the fourth, <HI>Crooked People.</HI> Not long after, the <HI>Tatluicans,</HI> a &s;trong People, went over the Mountains on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Mexican</HI> Lake, where they built &s;everal Towns
<PB N="296" REF="187">on a hot, yet fruitful Soil, the chiefe&s;t whereof they call'd <HI>Quahunachua,</HI> that is, <HI>A Place where an Eagles Voice is heard.</HI> The <HI>Tla&s;caltecans</HI> went near the Snowy Moun|tains, one, of which, being between <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>De los Angelos,</HI> vomits horrid Flames and Smoke up into the Skie.

After who&s;e Decea&s;e it de&s;cended of right to his Son and Heir <HI>Cecil,</HI> now Lord <HI>Baltemore;</HI> who thereupon &s;ent one Captain <HI>William Hill</HI> as his Deputy thither, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof, and to manage his Intere&s;t there for him. Captain <HI>Hill,</HI> according to his Commi&s;&s;ion, &s;hortly after repair'd thither, and liv'd &s;ome years at the Lord <HI>Bal|temore</HI>'s Hou&s;e at <HI>Ferryland</HI> above mention'd.</P>
<P>In the thirteenth Year of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, of <HI>England,</HI> &amp;c. about the Year of our Lord 1638. Marque&s;s <HI>Hamilton,</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> Sir <HI>David Kirk,</HI> and others, under pretence that the Lord <HI>Baltemore</HI> had de&s;erted that Plantation, obtain'd a Patent of all <HI>New-found Land,</HI> wherein <HI>Avalon</HI> was included, and &s;hortly after di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Lord <HI>Baltemore</HI> of his Man&s;ion Hou&s;e in <HI>Ferryland,</HI> and other Rights there, and during the late Rebellion in <HI>England</HI> kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but His now Ma|je&s;ty King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, immediately after his mo&s;t happy Re&s;tauration in the Year 1660, upon the now Lord <HI>Baltemore</HI>'s Petition, thought fit to refer the whole Matter to be Examin'd by Sir <HI>Orlando Bridgeman,</HI> then Lord-Chief Ju&s;tice, now Lord-Keeper of the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> and others, to report the true &s;tate thereof to His Maje&s;ty, together with their Opinions thereupon: The Referrees accordingly, upon full hearing of Council on both &s;ides, certifi'd; That they con|ceiv'd the &s;aid Patent to Sir <HI>George Calvert,</HI> to be a good Patent, in force, and not avoided by the later to Sir <HI>David Kirk</HI> and others; and that the Title and Intere&s;t to the &s;aid Province did therefore belong to the Lord <HI>Baltemore.</HI> Whereupon His Maje&s;ty, on the twentieth of <HI>March</HI> in the &s;ame Year, Order'd the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof to be re-deliver'd to his Lord&s;hip, which was accordingly executed: Since which time his Lord&s;hip has peaceably enjoy'd the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof, and continues the Plantation to this day, by deputing Lieutenants there from time to time, for the better Government of that Province, the re&s;t of <HI>New found Land</HI> remaining &s;till to the afore&s;aid Proprietors, claiming by the Patent of 13 <HI>Car.</HI> 1.</P>
<P>The Commodities that are either by Art or Nature produc'd there, are the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the remainder of <HI>New-found Land.</HI> The Winter there is extream cold, the Summer very hot, but withal plea&s;ant; and during that Sea&s;on there is great plenty of Pa&s;ture for Cattel.</P>
<P>The Coa&s;t of this Province is very &s;afe, and as well furni&s;h'd with variety of bold and plea&s;ant Harbors, as any other part of <HI>New-found Land;</HI> where the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> likewi&s;e Fi&s;h for Cod, the le&s;&s;er &s;ort whereof is call'd <HI>Poor-John,</HI> which is there caught in great abundance, e&s;pecially at <HI>Ferryland,</HI> and in the <HI>Bay of Bulls.</HI> Be&s;ides the&s;e two there are divers other excellent Harbors on the Ea&s;tern Shore of <HI>Avalon,</HI> as <HI>Capling Bay, Cape Broyle, Brittus, I&s;le of Spears, Barrom Cove, Whitburns Bay,</HI> and <HI>Petit Harbour</HI> above mention'd. On the We&s;t are the Bay of <HI>Placentia,</HI> and &s;everal other good Harbors.</P>
<P>There are no <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Avalon,</HI> and but few <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by rea&s;on of the exce&s;&s;ive Cold in Winter, though Sir <HI>David Kirk</HI> and his Lady, and al&s;o his Family, liv'd in the Lord <HI>Baltemore</HI>'s Hou&s;e at <HI>Ferryland</HI> for the &s;pace of ten years and upwards.</P>
<P>The Soil &s;eems to promi&s;e great &s;tore of Mines, which probably may in time be
<PB N="310" REF="198">di&s;over'd. The late Lord <HI>Baltemore</HI> took accidentally a piece of Oar up that lay there upon the &s;urface of the Earth, and brought it with him into <HI>England,</HI> which was found upon trial to yield a greater proportion of Silver, than the Oar of <HI>Poto&s;i</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> but hitherto no Mine of it hath been di&s;cover'd there.</P>
<P>The Trade of Fi&s;hing being of &s;o great concernment to the Nation of <HI>England,</HI> the &s;ame (if it be well manag'd in this I&s;land of <HI>Terra Nova</HI>) will employ every year above two hundred Sail of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships, and ten thou&s;and Mariners, be&s;ides the great benefit which may accrue unto the Nation by Impo&s;ition upon Strangers there, which would amount to &s;everal thou&s;ands of Pounds <HI>per Annum;</HI> with which tho&s;e Coa&s;ts may be Guarded, and Ships Trading thither &s;ecur'd: be&s;ides the great Cu&s;toms by the Ships call'd <HI>The Sacks</HI> (being commonly in great numbers every year) who carry Fi&s;h from <HI>New-found Land</HI> into the <HI>Straights, France, Portugal,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and who bring their Returns into <HI>England,</HI> as Bullion, and all other native Commodities of tho&s;e Countreys.</P>
<P>If the I&s;land were well fortifi'd, we might Command all tho&s;e of other Nations that come to Fi&s;h in <HI>New-found Land,</HI> to pay Contribution in Fi&s;h or otherwi&s;e, for their Priviledge to Fi&s;h there, the &s;aid I&s;land being fir&s;t Planted by <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and per|taining to the Kingdom of <HI>England;</HI> or if occa&s;ion &s;hould require, they might be utterly debarr'd of Fi&s;hing there.</P>
<P>The Trade of Fi&s;hing is of &s;o great concernment to <HI>France, Spain, Portugal,</HI> the <HI>Straights,</HI> and other Parts, that they cannot well be without that yearly Supply in Fi&s;h which comes from that I&s;land: Neither can the <HI>Hollanders, Spaniards,</HI> or <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> well &s;et any Ships to the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> without <HI>New-found Land</HI> Fi&s;h, there being none that will endure to pa&s;s the Line &s;ound and untainted, but the Fi&s;h of that Countrey, &s;alted and dry'd there. And &s;o long as the Act continues &s;till in force, That no Fi&s;h be Tran&s;ported from the &s;aid I&s;land, but in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bottoms, it will contribute very much to our encrea&s;e of Shipping there, and by con&s;equence, of the employment of Mariners; and the Fi&s;hing of that part of the I&s;land will be &s;olely appropriated to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, to whom of right it belongs, which will prove the greate&s;t Ballance of Trade in that part of the World; and that whereas above two hundred Sail do Trade thither yearly to Fi&s;h, if a thou&s;and Sail come, if there be but Fi&s;her-men enow, they may all have Fraughtage there.</P>
<P>The <HI>French,</HI> if once the I&s;land be fortifi'd, will be depriv'd of their Nur&s;ery of Mariners, this being the onely place, be&s;ides <HI>Canada,</HI> and one or two adjacent Coa&s;ts, where they come for &s;upply of Fi&s;h, with which that Nation cannot be furni&s;h'd &s;o well from other Parts.</P>
<P>By well Planting and Fortifying <HI>New-found Land,</HI> the Trading to <HI>Virginia, New England,</HI> and tho&s;e Parts, would be much encourag'd, <HI>New England</HI> having had of late great Traffick with <HI>New-found Land,</HI> where they vend the Growth of their Plantation. Be&s;ides, <HI>New-found Land</HI> is a Key to the Gulf of <HI>Canada,</HI> which if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had again in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, as they had in the Years 1628. and 1632. they might give a Law to all foreign Kings and People intere&s;ted in any of the parts of <HI>America,</HI> and a Protection to all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Plantations upon that Continent, where|by great &s;ecurity, comfort and profit would ari&s;e to the Nation and People of it: whereas on the contrary, if the <HI>French, Spani&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Dutch,</HI> &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of the &s;aid Plantation, they would not onely deprive this Nation of all the Ad|vantages afore&s;aid, but would al&s;o derive to them&s;elves &s;o great a Power to preju|dice all the Plantations of the Coa&s;ts of <HI>America</HI> belonging to this Nation, that the Inconveniences thereof are &s;carce to be imagin'd or expre&s;s'd.</P>

<P>The I&s;land on the North, which is le&s;s fruitful than the South part, produces Gold, and is generally water'd with many Rivers. There is al&s;o Silver, Tin, Lead, Quick&s;ilver, and <HI>Azure,</HI> us'd by Painters.

<P>The Veni&s;on taken here is very delicate, but difficult to be got; for this Bea&s;t having a breathing-place in its Back, never tires with running, and when encom|pa&s;s'd by the Dogs, falls valiantly on tho&s;e that are neare&s;t to it, and often tears them in pieces.</P>

<P>This great I&s;land is ea&s;ie to be conquer'd, and would make the be&s;t Plantation, be&s;ides the prejudice it would be to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and the great advantage to our Nation; for in&s;tance, Had we the Port and City of <HI>Havana,</HI> which might in all probability be reduc'd with two Regiments of good Soldiers from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> carry|ing with them two or three Sloops or Shallops for Landing Men, fitted with good Arms and other Nece&s;&s;aries for an A&s;&s;ault, pre&s;ently after their Armado hath pa&s;s'd out of the <HI>Indies,</HI> which is once in two years, towards the latter part of the Summer. There is good Landing on the We&s;t &s;ide of the City, where it lies open; and you need fear no Ambu&s;cado's: but not on the Ea&s;t &s;ide on the Harbor, for there you will be gawl'd by the &s;trong Ca&s;tle of the <HI>Moare,</HI> until the City be &s;ecur'd; but when that is once taken, you may ea&s;ily reduce that Ca&s;tle al&s;o, there being no danger of their re-taking it, until the next Armado arrives there, which will be al|mo&s;t two years, again&s;t which time you will have Planters enough from other of our I&s;lands, to Manure the Land, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the Soldiers in defence thereof: This once effected, would utterly ruine the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for the&s;e Rea&s;ons: Our Ships lying both here and at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> would be at all times ready to gather up their &s;tragling Fleet, which it is difficult to keep imbodied without the help of that Port of <HI>Ha|vana,</HI> it being impo&s;&s;ible for their great unruly Ships to turn up to Windward from the Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> or <HI>Puerto Bello,</HI> without &s;eparation; and on the other &s;ide, to pa&s;s the Gulf of <HI>Florida,</HI> is for them as impo&s;&s;ible, where they always Rendezvouz, Victual, Water, and provide all things nece&s;&s;ary for their Return into <HI>Spain;</HI> after all which they diligently wait for a convenient Sea&s;on of Winds and Weather (be|ing much ob&s;erv'd from the Changes of the Moon) when to pa&s;s that dangerous <HI>Straight:</HI> for to &s;ay truly, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are neither very fit for Sea nor Land-Service, excepting &s;ome Officers and Soldiers bred in <HI>Flanders</HI> for Land-Service, and a few <HI>Bi&s;cainers</HI> for Sea-Affairs.

<P>For half a year together Day and Night are equal in the&s;e Parts, and the re&s;t of the Year the Day fourteen hours long, and the Night ten.</P>

Moreover, they adorn their Head with Plumes, their Ears with Fi&s;h-bones, or Scales of the <HI>Caret,</HI> or pieces of Cry&s;tal, which they al&s;o hang in their Lips and No&s;es. The Men wear Armlets near their Shoulders, and the Women about their Wri&s;ts; about their Legs they tie for Garters Strings of Seeds: others take a pride in wearing the Bones of their &s;lain Enemies, and the Teeth of the <HI>Agouty,</HI> Tygers, wild Cats, or Cockle &s;hells.

<P>The mo&s;t antient <HI>Caribbeeans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fabulous Tradition.</NOTE> living under no other Roof than the Canopy of Heaven, fed on nothing but what the Fields naturally produc'd, which &s;alvage Life an old Man much beamoan'd; when a certain Deity clad in white Apparel de&s;cending down on the Earth, &s;aid, <HI>That he would have come &s;ooner to have &s;hew'n them the way of a civil Life, had they reque&s;ted it before.</HI> Moreover, the Angel &s;hew'd them a place along the Shore where there lay &s;harp-cutting Stones, with which he told them they might cut down Trees, and with the Timber build them&s;elves Hou&s;es, and cover them with the Leaves of the Palm-Tree to keep out the Rain; which &s;aid, he broke his Staff into three pieces, which being Planted, &s;oon after produc'd the Root <HI>Manioe,</HI> which &s;tamp'd and dry'd, made good Bread.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Opini|on concern|ing the Soul.</NOTE>The <HI>Caribbeeans</HI> have al&s;o a &s;trange Opinion concerning the Soul, that is to &s;ay, That every one hath as many Souls as he hath Pul&s;es, but the chiefe&s;t is the Heart it &s;elf, which after Death removes with <HI>Jeheizi,</HI> (that is every ones peculiar God or Genius) to the Company of the other Deities, where they live after the &s;ame man|ner as here on Earth; wherefore tho&s;e that are Per&s;ons of Quality give Charge at their Deaths, that their Servants may be kill'd and buried with them, that &s;o they may &s;erve them in the other World; That the other Souls, which are the Pul&s;es,

<P>So &s;oon as they hear a clap of Thunder they run into their Huts, and place them&s;elves on little Stools round the Fire, cover their Faces, and laying their Heads on their Knees, make a doleful noi&s;e, as &s;uppo&s;ing that <HI>Maboya</HI> is exceedingly enrag'd again&s;t them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man|ner of Dwel|ling.</NOTE>Their Huts, for the mo&s;t part built near Rivers and Streams, are of an oval fa&s;hion, their Roofs made of Palm-Tree Leaves or Sugar-Canes, the Walls nothing but Boughs &s;et in the Ground and pleited together, and the Floor of &s;ifted Earth or Sand, ramm'd in and kept very even and &s;mooth; be&s;ides a Room wherein they Sleep and Entertain their Friends, they have al&s;o a Kitchin to dre&s;s their Meat, and a place to lay their Bowes, Arrows, Clubs, and the like, in; they u&s;e Mats in &s;tead of Walls, to &s;eparate one Apartment from the other.

<P>Round about their Huts feed many Hens and Turkies, which they breed not &s;o much for their own u&s;e, as to exchange for Iron.</P>

If any Woman committed Adultery, her Husband was permitted to knock out her Brains, or rip open her Belly; which done, he acquainted her Fa|ther with the Deed, who return'd him thanks for the &s;ame.

At fifteen days old they made Holes in the Childs Ears, Lips, and No&s;trils, through which they put a String for the tying on of what-ever Ornamentals. With the like Ceremonies the Child receiv'd a Name, taken from his Predece&s;&s;ors, Trees, Fi&s;hes, or &s;ome remarkable Pa&s;&s;ages during the Mothers bearing of the Infant in her Womb, or of the Father's Lying-in: But this Name was chang'd &s;o &s;oon as they went to War, or kill'd a Commander of the <HI>Arovages,</HI> who&s;e Name they exchang'd for their own: After which the Mothers took &s;pecial care in bringing them up, and at &s;ix Moneths the Children were able to run alone: When they attain'd to the age of two years, they cut off their Hair, at a great Fea&s;t made for that purpo&s;e; from which time forward they exercis'd them in Shooting with Bowes and Ar|rows; to which purpo&s;e they hung up pieces of Meat for them to &s;hoot at, which they mu&s;t either hit down, or Fa&s;t.</P>

<P>The principal Road or Bay is call'd <HI>Carli&s;le Bay,</HI> and lieth on the South-We&s;t part of the I&s;land near its Center, and is a good Road, where five hundred Ships of any Burthen may Ride &s;afely from all but South and We&s;terly Winds, which &s;eldom in the&s;e Parts happen, they ge|nerally blowing Ea&s;terly, whence it is that we call the Ea&s;t parts <HI>Windward,</HI> and the We&s;t parts <HI>Leeward.</HI> Here lies al&s;o the chief Town for Trade, call'd formerly the <HI>Bridge-Town,</HI> but now <HI>St. Michaels,</HI> and having two Forts, an&s;wering each other, and a Platform between, which Commands the Road, and Defends the Town; the fir&s;t and chiefe&s;t Fort is call'd <HI>Charles Fort,</HI> &s;tanding on <HI>Nedhams Point,</HI> lying out in the Sea to Windward of the Bay and Town, &s;o that an Enemy keeping out of Command of this Fort, cannot (probably) come to do the Ships or the Town injury, for that they mu&s;t come full in or again&s;t the Wind. This Fort is built &s;trong with Stone and Lime; the Platform joyns to the Windward part of the Town; al&s;o the other Fort joyns to the Leeward part of the Town, all which are well fortifi'd and &s;tor'd with great Guns. The Town con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal Streets and Lanes, being about thirty Chain in length, and fif|teen in breadth, and hath many fair and large Buildings, whereof the mo&s;t are of Stone and Lime.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Road and Town is lately call'd <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> &s;ituate on <HI>Oy&s;ters-Bay,</HI> and lies about two Leagues to Windward of <HI>St. Michaels,</HI> having al&s;o two Forts and one Platform; the two Forts &s;tand the one to Windward, and the other to Leeward of the Town and Road, and the Platform in the middle, all well furni&s;h'd with great Guns. And although this Town be not a Place of much Re&s;ort for Shipping, yet here are many con&s;iderable Store-hou&s;es for Trade, wherein Monethly are kept the Court of <HI>Common-Pleas</HI> for that Precinct, and Weekly Markets.</P>
<P>The third Road and Town is lately call'd <HI>St. James's,</HI> formerly the <HI>Hall,</HI> and is about two Leagues to the Leeward of <HI>St. Michaels,</HI> hath one very large Platform, and is otherwi&s;e well for|tifi'd with Brea&s;t-works; and although few Ships come to Ride here, yet in this Town is main|tain'd a great Trade with the Inhabitants adjacent; here al&s;o is kept Monethly the Court of <HI>Com|mon-Pleas</HI> for this Precinct.</P>
<P>The fourth Road and Town is lately call'd <HI>Little Bri&s;tol,</HI> but formerly <HI>Sprights-Bay,</HI> which lieth about four Leagues to Leeward of <HI>St. Michaels,</HI> and hath two Forts well built, and &s;trongly fortifi'd.

<P>This I&s;land is divided into eleven Pari&s;hes, and hath in it fourteen Churches and Chappels, and being &s;ubdivided into divers Plantations, &s;mall and great, hath Sugar-works accordingly, with fair and large Buildings made of Stone and Brick, the which generally are plea&s;ant Habi|tations, and delightfully &s;ituated, mo&s;t having plea&s;ant Pro&s;pects to the Sea and Land.</P>

<P>The Governor <HI>Layola</HI> built four Towns here, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Valladolid;</HI> 2. <HI>Loyola;</HI> 3. <HI>San Jago de los Montanas;</HI> and 4. <HI>Caruma.</HI></P>
<P>The Je&s;uit <HI>Aco&s;ta</HI> relates, That not far from <HI>Caruma</HI> he found great Stones, &s;ome of which were full of Golden Veins, but were hard to be cut from the Rock. Mo&s;t of the Gold is found in the Sand of &s;everal Rivers, the chiefe&s;t whereof flow through <HI>Quito, New Granada, Valdivita</HI> in <HI>Chili,</HI> and <HI>Caravaya</HI> in <HI>Peru.</HI></P>
<P>On the Point of <HI>Quito,</HI> the River <HI>San Jago</HI> falls into the Southern Ocean; the Ground in the Mouth of the River being very uneven, for oftentimes the Ships are
<PB N="447" REF="288">fa&s;t aground at the Stern, and on Head they have above eighty Fathom Water; yet neverthele&s;s the Shoals are no ways dangerous.</P>
<P>South-We&s;t from <HI>St. Jago</HI> lies the &s;pacious Inlet <HI>Mattheo,</HI> and the Promontory <HI>Franci&s;co,</HI> known by its Banks and high Grounds, which &s;hew red and white at a great di&s;tance.</P>
<P>Not far from hence, exactly under the <HI>Equinox,</HI> appears <HI>Cape Pa&s;&s;ao,</HI> flat and low; between which and <HI>Mattheo,</HI> the great Rivers <HI>Los Quiximes</HI> fall into the Sea.</P>
<P>Behind <HI>Pa&s;&s;ao</HI> ri&s;es the high Mountain <HI>Quaque;</HI> and more We&s;terly the Bay <HI>Cara|ques</HI> affords a &s;ecure Harbor for all manner of Ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>Next you come to the Town <HI>Puerto Viejo</HI> before mention'd, lying behind the I&s;land <HI>Lauren&s;o.</HI></P>
<P>Five Leagues off at Sea, before <HI>Laurenoz,</HI> lies the I&s;land <HI>Plata,</HI> formerly famous for a <HI>Peruvian</HI> Temple, in which the Natives Sacrifis'd Sheep, and &s;ometimes Chil|dren, and painted the Figures of divers Per&s;ons with the Blood; to which they al&s;o Offer'd Jewels, Gold, Silver, Wooll, Cotton Shirts, and Cloaks. <HI>Franci&s;co Pizarro</HI> arriving here, got an invaluable Ma&s;s of Trea&s;ure; but at pre&s;ent it ly|ing de&s;olate, affords nothing but Brambles and wild Trees.</P>
<P>The next which come in view are the Havens <HI>Callo</HI> and <HI>Zalango,</HI> where there are &s;afe Harbors, good Wood and Water.</P>
<P>The Cape of <HI>St. Helena</HI> makes al&s;o a &s;ecure Road on the North, and on its Shore hath a Spring, on the top of who&s;e Waters &s;wims a certain Gum, by the Natives call'd <HI>Copey,</HI> exceeding good to make Ships tight.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Tumbez</HI> falls into a large Bay, which on its North-Ea&s;t Point near the Main Land, hath the I&s;land <HI>Puna,</HI> ten Leagues in circumference: The Soyl where|of produces abundance of <HI>Maiz, Juca,</HI> and other good Roots, be&s;ides great Woods full of fruitful Trees, and <HI>Sar&s;aparilla.</HI> The Inhabitants of a brown Complexion, and middle Stature, wear Cotton Cloaks, and Chains of <HI>Chaquira</HI> and Precious Stones: They drive a great Trade, and formerly maintain'd Wars with the Peo|ple inhabiting upon the River <HI>Tumbez;</HI> their great want is fre&s;h Water in the Summer. <HI>Thomas Candi&s;h</HI> Landing here <HI>Anno</HI> 1587. found a Ship hal'd a&s;hore, and three Villages, in one of which &s;tood a Palace belonging to a <HI>Ca&s;ique,</HI> &s;urrounded with Stone Galleries; and near it a large Store-hou&s;e full of Tar-pots and Hemp to make Cables of: The Village con&s;i&s;ted of two hundred Hou&s;es, and a fair Church with a Steeple, in which hung &s;everal Bells. The <HI>Ca&s;ique</HI> Married to a <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Woman being fled with the Villagers, <HI>Candi&s;h</HI> took many Oxen, fat Sheep, Pi|geons and Ducks, the Bells, and what el&s;e was not convey'd aboard, with him, and afterwards burnt the whole Town; but while&s;t he was bu&s;ie in making havock, a thou&s;and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and a con&s;iderable number of <HI>Peruvians</HI> fell upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> on &s;uch a &s;udden, that they kill'd &s;ome, and took others Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Somewhat farther off at Sea appears the I&s;le <HI>Clara,</HI> where tho&s;e of <HI>Puna</HI> formerly buried their Dead.</P>
<P>The Inlet into which falls the River <HI>Tumbez,</HI> who&s;e Shores are well inhabited, ends We&s;tward at the Promontory <HI>Blanco;</HI> Southward from which lies the I&s;le <HI>Lo|bos,</HI> where there are &s;everal Springs full of the &s;ame Gum, or <HI>Bitumen,</HI> a little above mention'd.</P>
<P>Beyond the Point <HI>Agua</HI> lie the two I&s;les <HI>Lobos Marinos,</HI> oppo&s;ite to a low Coa&s;t; they are de&s;olate, and barren of Gra&s;s, Trees, and all kind of Herbs, and de&s;titute of fre&s;h Water; but many Pelicans, Penguins, and other &s;trange Birds.</P>

No Countrey un|der the Heavens affords a more fruitful or plea&s;anter Place than this; the tempe|rate Climate neither troubling the Inhabitants with exce&s;&s;ive Heats or great Colds, nor terrifying them with Thunder or Lightning, but having almo&s;t perpetual Sun-&s;hine and fair Weather; onely the three Winter Moneths, wherein there falls a &s;weet-&s;melling Dew, which cures the Head-ache; and there die but very few of pe&s;tilential Di&s;tempers.

But we will fir&s;t give you a general De&s;cription of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Temperature of Cli|mate.</NOTE> that &s;o we may the better render a Relation in particular of every Province thereof, it being a con&s;iderable part of the <HI>New World,</HI> and both plea&s;ant and fruit|ful, and the Sea-Coa&s;ts refre&s;h'd by Ea&s;terly Winds, which begin before Day|break, when the North Sea ebbs or flows, for then the Wind ri&s;es with the Sun, and continues till Mid-night: Towards the We&s;t, where the Mountains divide <HI>Bra&s;ile</HI> from <HI>Peru,</HI> it is made temperate by We&s;terly Winds, which though judg'd unwhol|&s;om, becau&s;e they &s;eem to ari&s;e out of the Moori&s;h Grounds, yet they hurt not the Inhabitants along that Coa&s;t, becau&s;e they either break again&s;t the high Moun|tains, or are driven by the &s;trong Wind which blows from the Sea.</P>
<P>The difference between Summer and Winter, &s;horter and longer Days, in the main part of <HI>Bra&s;ile,</HI> is &s;carce di&s;cernable, warm Weather la&s;ting all the year round; and for the length of the Day and Night, the Sun being hid under the Horizon twelve hours, &s;hines for the mo&s;t part ju&s;t as long, the greate&s;t difference never being above an hour. Three hours before Day-break the Dew makes it exceeding cold till Sun-ri&s;ing; wherefore the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> make Fires in the Night near their Hammocks, not onely to keep wild Bea&s;ts from them, but al&s;o again&s;t the Cold. After the colde&s;t Nights follow the faire&s;t Days, and the contrary after &s;ultry Nights; neverthele&s;s (except in the rainy Sea&s;on, which begins with <HI>March</HI> and ends about <HI>Augu&s;t</HI>) the Skye is generally clear, yet it Lightens much towards the Evening. Rainbowes often appear in the Skye, and bout the Mooon <HI>Halos.</HI> The Rain generally falls in great Drops, and with a mighty noi&s;e; before which it is generally very &s;ultry hot, or el&s;e &s;oon after. The Dew, which is fruit|fuller than in <HI>Europe,</HI> is &s;alti&s;h, which makes it oft to rot things that lie in the open Air. During the rainy Moneths, a South-Ea&s;t Winds blows from a cloudy Skye, much &s;tronger than the Northern in Summer, The South-Ea&s;t Wind drives the Stream to the North, as the North Wind drives it to the South: And more than this, there is little to be di&s;cern'd of the Seas ebbing and flowing hereabouts: At the highe&s;t Tides the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> go &s;everal Leagues from the Shore to Fi&s;h, upon Planks made of the &s;pungy Wood call'd <HI>Jangada</HI> fa&s;tned together. The Sea, which &s;eems to burn in the Night, is &s;o clear in the Day, that the Fi&s;h may be &s;een to &s;wim above twenty Fathom deep. A calm Ocean when the Days and Nights are of an exact length, and e&s;pecially when dark Clouds appear, is a certain &s;ign of a dreadful Storm. At Full or New-Moon the Sea ri&s;es twelve Foot, and con|tinues either a longer or &s;horter time, according as it is more or le&s;s turbulent, and the Rivers fall &s;tronger or more gently into the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Before mo&s;t part of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;ile</HI> lies a Stone Cliff of above twenty or thirty Paces broad, which is never cover'd with Water, though in the time of Spring-floods. In this Cliff Nature in &s;everal places hath made a Gap, through which the Ships &s;ail near the Shore, and ride &s;afe at an Anchor.</P>
<P>The whole Countrey of <HI>Bra&s;ile</HI> is divided into thirteen <HI>Praefectures,</HI> or Lord|&s;hips, and hath about as many Rivers, which more or le&s;s empty them&s;elves into every one of the&s;e Countreys. The Ea&s;tern part hath &s;everal Brooks and Foun|tains, which afford good Water both for Man and Bea&s;t. In &s;ome parts the Water is &s;o &s;trong, that the wild Bea&s;ts making them&s;elves Drunk therewith, are ea&s;ily taken. During the Winter Sea&s;on the Rivers glide with great force, and &s;well on a
<PB N="480" REF="320">&s;udden, overflowing all the neighboring Countrey, onely the River <HI>San Franci&s;co</HI> runs &s;tronge&s;t and ri&s;es highe&s;t in the Summer Sea&s;on, whenas in the Winter it flows low, and poures but little Water into the Ocean. The original of this Ri|ver is as yet unknown, yet is by mo&s;t believ'd to come out of a great Lake lying near the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Mountains: The <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who &s;ail'd forty Leagues up the &s;ame, found it every where broad and deep, and &s;catter'd full of I&s;les and Rocks. The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> &s;ailing ten Leagues farther, di&s;cover'd the great Rocks <HI>Cocoeras,</HI> from which the &s;aid River falls down with great violence, and extends it &s;elf North-We&s;t. In the other <HI>Bra&s;ilian</HI> Streams, though wide at the Mouthes, which generally are not above two or three hours walking from their Fountains or Springs, no Barque is able to Row up, they being exceeding &s;hallow, although much Rain falls into them; the rea&s;on whereof is becau&s;e the barren Mountains lying be|tween <HI>Bra&s;ile</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> di&s;charge abundance of Water through the Rivers of <HI>Ama|zones, Maranon, Franci&s;co, La Plata,</HI> and the <HI>Juaeiro,</HI> with &s;uch force into the Ocean, that they keep their &s;weetne&s;s for thirty Leagues. Near the Sea &s;ide are &s;eve|ral Lakes and Pits which are drinkable, and others up in the Countrey that are bracki&s;h.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nature of the Soil.</NOTE>The Countrey differs exceedingly, for where it extends in Plains the Soil is fat and clayie, and produces all &s;orts of Fruit, but e&s;pecially Sugar-Canes. During the rainy Sea&s;ons the Trees flouri&s;h mo&s;t; after which the heat of the Sun, and fer|tility of the Soil &s;peedily ripen the Fruit: wherefore they Dung not their Land, but on the contrary endeavor to make it lean with Sand, that the Plants might not have too many Leaves, and wither before the Fruit can be ripened. They Sowe in the beginning of the rainy Moneths, and e&s;pecially take care that the Seed lie not too deep in the Ground, becau&s;e then the Sun-beams being not able to come at it, &s;uffer it to peri&s;h in the cold Ground.</P>
<P>The high <HI>Cocoa</HI> and <HI>Palmito</HI>-Trees, are tran&s;planted all the year round, the Roots being onely cover'd with a little Earth, becau&s;e they can endure no cold.</P>
<P>Several Trees here bear a cooling Fruit, as if kind Nature took care to provide again&s;t exce&s;&s;ive heat.</P>
<P>All manner of Plants and Herbs brought hither from <HI>Angola, Portugal,</HI> the <HI>Nether|lands,</HI> and the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> grow here very plentifully. But the Countrey generally would be much better, if &s;ome way could be found out to de&s;troy the innumera|ble company of Pi&s;mires, which though three times bigger than the <HI>European,</HI> re|&s;emble them very much, and cover the Paths in Woods and Fields for three or four Miles together; and rai&s;ing Hillocks, make them hollow, and fill them with Corn: in the Full of the Moon they gather an incredible quantity of Grain, which they bite at each end, becau&s;e it &s;hould not &s;prout: again&s;t the rainy Moneths they &s;top up their Holes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cription of the <HI>Ta|manda.</HI></NOTE> that the Water may not damnifie their Store. But the&s;e Animals have a mortal Enemy of the <HI>Tamanda,</HI> of which there are two &s;orts, the bigger call'd <HI>Guaca,</HI> the le&s;&s;er <HI>Miri;</HI> the <HI>Guaca,</HI> notwith&s;tanding it is no bigger than an or|dinary Dog, yet it de&s;troys Tygers, and other wild Bea&s;ts, with &s;uch a raging fury, that it never lets go what once it hath got hold of, but holds it fa&s;t &s;o long till &s;ome|times it dies of Hunger. The <HI>Guaca</HI> differing from the <HI>Miri</HI> onely in bigne&s;s, hath a broad Tail full of grey and black Bri&s;tles, which &s;ticks up when he is vex'd, but when he goes to &s;leep, covers him&s;elf with the &s;ame. The <HI>Miri</HI> winds his long &s;mooth Tail about the Boughs, by which hanging he &s;earches the Holes in the Trees with his Tongue, which being thin and round, hath a Gutter in the middle, in which when it feels any Pi&s;mires, it &s;uddenly &s;wallows them down: If he per|ceives them to have their Ne&s;ts under Ground, then he &s;cratches up the Earth, and
<PB N="481" REF="320">puts his Tongue in at the Holes. Both the <HI>Guacu</HI> and <HI>Miri</HI> have a thick Skin, and a broad black Streak from their Brea&s;ts on each &s;ide up half way their Bodies, and through the black runs al&s;o a white Streak. No Bea&s;t in the World is hardier than this, for though it fa&s;ts twelve days, and is afterwards flay'd alive, yet it will live &s;everal hours after.</P>
<P>The Lakes in <HI>Bra&s;ile</HI> are for the mo&s;t part overgrown with Weeds ju&s;t like a Field, yet are exceeding full of Fi&s;h and Fowl. Where the Sea runs into the Lakes, great multitudes of Crabs are &s;een crawling along the Ground, and the Oy&s;ters hang in Clu&s;ters on the Boughs of a Plant call'd <HI>Manyle</HI> or <HI>Mangues,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Plant <HI>Manyle.</HI></NOTE> which grow with their Roots either near or in the Water, in &s;uch a manner, that new Bodies &s;till &s;hoot from the old Roots, which prevents ea&s;ie acce&s;s to the chief Plant, on who&s;e uppermo&s;t Leaves after Sun-ri&s;ing &s;ticks very white Salt, which in the Night, or in a cloudy Day turns to a bracki&s;h Dew. Moreover, tho&s;e places where <HI>Bra&s;ile</HI> ri&s;es with Hills and Mountains, are likewi&s;e very fruitful, except the barren tops of &s;ome, which &s;eem to ki&s;s the Skyes; and though the fruitful Mountains flouri&s;h in the time of the rainy Months, yet many of the Trees which grow on them die in Summer, and their A&s;hes being burnt by the Inhabitants, are us'd in &s;tead of Dung. Some Woods extend them&s;elves three hundred Leagues in length, and are full of Trees, &s;o tall, that an Arrow &s;hot upwards falls &s;hort of the top of them, and a Boat may be made out of the Body, which can carry a hundred and fifty Men. On the great Boughs of the&s;e mighty Trees grow other excre&s;cent Shrubs after the manner of Mi&s;&s;eltoe, which proceed from the Kernels &s;wallow'd and muted upon them by the Birds that light there. In &s;ome places al&s;o grow al&s;o Sweet-wood Trees, which afford either excellent Gums or Wood to Dye with; among&s;t which the chief is the <HI>Ibiripitanga,</HI> which yields the <HI>Bra&s;ile</HI> Wood, that gives Denomination of <HI>Bra&s;ile</HI> to this va&s;t Tract of Land.<NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;cription of the Tree <HI>Ibripitanga.</HI></NOTE> The Tree <HI>Ibripitanga</HI> is tall and &s;preading, hath &s;ad colour'd Bark full of &s;hort Thorns; the Leaves are green, and differ in form but little from the Box-Tree Leaf; the Boughs &s;hoot forth other le&s;&s;er, full of yellow and &s;weet-&s;melling Flowers, which falling off are &s;ucceeded by a flat long Cod, of a dark grey colour, full of little red Pul&s;e; the upper part of the Tree is not good to Dye with, but onely the lower part of the Body, which becau&s;e the Tree grows far up in the Countrey, is not tran&s;port|able without much trouble. But the <HI>Tatai-iba</HI> grows in the Woods along the Shore;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Tree <HI>Tatai-iba.</HI></NOTE> the Bark being of an A&s;h-colour, inve&s;ts a yellow Wood; the Leaves are &s;harp and notch'd, the Fruit not unlike Mulberries, pale, juicy, and full of white Seed; the Wood boyl'd Dyes a pure Yellow. It is ob&s;ervable not onely of this Tree, but generally of the Trees of this Countrey, that they neither flouri&s;h, nor &s;hed their Leaves all over at once, nor do &s;everal Trees of the &s;ame kind, and growing here germinate or fade together; for while&s;t one is fulle&s;t of Blo&s;&s;oms, the other is without Leaves; and while&s;t the &s;ame Tree &s;heds its Leaves on one &s;ide, the other &s;ide is newly Budded.</P>
<P>The <HI>European</HI> Plants and Herbs with &s;oft Roots, being once Planted in <HI>Bra&s;ile,</HI> come to be hard and lignifi'd. There is al&s;o great difference, according to the Ground in which they are Planted; for &s;uch Plants and Trees as in the Plains are but &s;mall and tender, grow ten times higher if Planted in the Woods.</P>
<P>All &s;orts of <HI>Indian</HI> Pul&s;e grow higher than the talle&s;t Trees, like high Arbors, under which both Men and Bea&s;ts may &s;helter them&s;elves from the Sun or Rain.</P>
<P>We find not upon Record or Tradition, that <HI>Bra&s;ile</HI> was ever troubled with an Earthquake, which is the rea&s;on that it hath neither Silver nor Gold-Mines, becau&s;e &s;ulphurous Fires are found under Ground, which are a cau&s;e of the production of

<P>Far up into the Countrey among&s;t the Mountains, inhabit <HI>Canibals,</HI> or Man-eaters. The <HI>Europeans</HI> that fir&s;t travell'd that way, found the Countrey very fertile and full of People, e&s;pecially in the Valleys, but &s;omewhat incommoded by the want of Water, and the exce&s;&s;ivene&s;s of the Heat in the Day, and of the Cold in the Night. In &s;ome places the Countrey is &s;o over-grown with Brambles, that they are forc'd to cut their way through the &s;ame. But there are a &s;ort of Thi&s;tles, which having concave Leaves, receive the Dew and Rain for the accommodation of the Natives.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides Serpents and Dragons, the Tygers are mo&s;t of all to be fear'd when hungry, but once &s;atisfi'd are ea&s;ily taken.</P>

The Men generally have a very near re&s;emblance one with another, as al&s;o the Women, &s;o that there is not &s;uch a difference betwixt Man and Man there, as among&s;t other People. There is &s;carce any Sickne&s;s heard of in the&s;e Parts; for be&s;ides a long Life, they enjoy the benefit of Health &s;o long as they live.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their manner of Living.</NOTE>The general Bread of the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> is the &s;tamp'd Root <HI>Mandihoka;</HI> be&s;ides which they al&s;o eat all manner of Fruit and Plants, and many times Fle&s;h, which they either eat boyl'd, broyl'd, or &s;tew'd; their Boyling is after this manner: Fir&s;t they kindle their Fire with two Sticks, the one of hard, and the other of &s;oft Wood; the hard they make &s;harp at the end, and fix the &s;ame into the &s;oft, which &s;etting on fire they immediately lay Cotton thereupon, or el&s;e dry Leaves, and &s;o boyl the Fle&s;h in round Earthen Pots call'd <HI>Camu:</HI> but they account that better which is
<PB N="483" REF="321">&s;tew'd in a Pot, the bottom whereof is cover'd with Leaves, on which they lay the Fle&s;h, then &s;topping the &s;ame clo&s;e on the top with Earth and Leaves, they make Fire over it &s;o long till they think the Fle&s;h to be &s;ufficiently &s;tew'd. Their Broyl|ing they perform by fixing forked Stick into the Ground, over which they lay &s;eve|ral others like a Gridiron, and upon them the raw Fle&s;h, cut in long Slices, and Pepper'd and Salted, then make a Fire under the &s;ame till it is enough; and their Meat &s;o dre&s;s'd keeps good fourteen days. Their Fi&s;h either boyl'd or broyl'd is eaten with the Sawce <HI>Juquitinga.</HI> The little Fi&s;h <HI>Piaba</HI> and <HI>Piquitinga</HI> they make up in Rolls, and lay them under hot A&s;hes.

Their u&s;ual Liquor is cold Water, taken out of the Fountains, Rivers, or Brooks;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their &s;everal &s;orts of Drinks.</NOTE> but to Carou&s;e they make the Drink <HI>Caoi,</HI> of the Fruit of the <HI>Ocaiiba</HI>-Tree, which being &s;tamp'd in a woodden Mortar, is &s;train'd, and at fir&s;t looks like Milk, but after a few days &s;tanding turns to a darker colour, and is &s;trong enough to make A&s;tronomers of tho&s;e that drink largely of it, but if long kept, it turns to be excel|lent Vinegar.</P>
<P>They have another Drink call'd <HI>Aipu,</HI> which is made two &s;everal ways; the fir&s;t is thus: An old Toothle&s;s Woman chews the little cut Root <HI>Aipimacaxera</HI> to a a Pap call'd <HI>Caracu,</HI> which &s;pitting in a Pot they pour Water on the &s;ame, and after|wards boyling it lei&s;urely, &s;tirring it all the time it &s;tands over the Fire. The other way of making this <HI>Aipu,</HI> which is much the more cleanly, is to boyl the &s;aid Root &s;o long, till it comes to be like Butter-milk, and then letting it &s;tand till it hath done working, it will be no unplea&s;ant Drink.</P>
<P>Another &s;ort of Drink among&s;t them is their <HI>Pacobi,</HI> made of the Fruit of the Tree <HI>Pacobebe</HI> and <HI>Pacobucu;</HI> be&s;ides others made of the Tree <HI>Abatu,</HI> of <HI>Indian</HI> Bar|ley and <HI>Maiz.</HI> Al&s;o their Liquor call'd <HI>Jetici</HI> is pre&s;s'd out of <HI>Potato</HI>-Roots.</P>
<P>In like manner the Plant <HI>Nana,</HI> by the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> call'd <HI>Ananas,</HI> makes the Drink <HI>Nanai,</HI> which is exceeding &s;trong and heady, but good again&s;t Faintne&s;s, Vomit|ing, Gravel, and &s;toppage of Urine, as al&s;o again&s;t Poy&s;on.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Debo|ches.</NOTE>The <HI>Tapuiyans,</HI> &s;ur-named <HI>Cariri,</HI> meet at a certain time to make the Liquor <HI>Aipu,</HI> whereof each takes as much to his Hut as falls to his &s;hare, and when it hath done working, they begin in the Morning very early at the fir&s;t Hou&s;e in the Vil|lage, and drink out every drop which they find there, and &s;o from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e till they have drunk one another drie; and he is look'd upon to be the be&s;t Man that hath drunk and evacuated mo&s;t.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their man|ner of Taking Tobacco.</NOTE>The <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> take generally very &s;trong Tobacco, which they fir&s;t drie in the Sun, and afterwards before the Fire, the better to rub it in pieces: Their Tobacco-pipe is a Cane and a hollow Nut cut off at the top, and a round Hole bor'd in the middle, into which they put the Cane. They forbear not to take Tobacco even in the mid&s;t of their religious Ceremonies, which are perform'd with Singing and Dancing in this manner:</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their religi|ous Ceremo|nies.</NOTE>The <HI>Tapuaiyans</HI> making a round Ring at an equal di&s;tance one from another, all of them being &s;tark naked, tie divers colour'd Plumes of Feathers on their back-&s;ides

Their Songs contain fir&s;t a mournful Relation of a general Deluge, which drowned their Predece&s;&s;ors, all but &s;ome few, who e&s;cap'd by climbing up high Trees and Mountains; next the Acts of tho&s;e old Heroes from whom they boa&s;t them&s;elves Extracted, who lo&s;t their Lives, or valiantly fought for the publick good, and were rewarded with the enjoyment of all plea&s;ures and Delights, of Sing|ing, Playing, Dancing, and the like, in a remote Countrey, whither after their Deaths they hope to be tran&s;lated: While&s;t they thus Sing over all their Songs, three Prie&s;ts &s;tand in the middle of the Ring, each holding the Idol <HI>Maraka</HI> (in their left Hand) re&s;embling an old O&s;tritch's Egg &s;tuck full of Feathers on the top: about their Wa&s;tes they wear a Girdle of rich Plumes, on their Heads al&s;o a Crown of Feathers; the middle Prie&s;t looks with a &s;tern Countenance, and holds up his left Leg from the Ground, while&s;t the other two &s;tanding on each &s;ide of him, hold in their right Hands a Pipe, out of which blowing Tobacco-&s;moak in one anothers Faces, they utter the&s;e words, <HI>Receive the Spirit of heroick Strength:</HI> The Dance ended, they Entertain their Prie&s;ts with Meat and Drink eight days together, and al&s;o put Meat before their Idol <HI>Maraka,</HI> who is the chief Deity they adore.</P>

Their Trumpets, call'd <HI>Canguenca,</HI> are the Shin-bones of Men, though

They go all &s;tark naked; their Legs are colour'd black with the Juice of the Herb <HI>Junipap,</HI> and upon the other parts of their Body appear Fi|gures of &s;everal Repre&s;entations.

They never come to their u&s;ual Fea&s;ts, but dre&s;s'd up in various colour'd Feathers; upon the Crown of their Heads they wear Caps &s;tuck with Plumes, which they call <HI>Acangoap,</HI> or Coronets, call'd <HI>Acangerar;</HI> about their Necks, the Necklaces <HI>Aiouacava;</HI> over their Shoulders, the Man|tles <HI>A&s;&s;oyave;</HI> their Garters they call <HI>Tabacoura,</HI> at which they hang hollow Nut|&s;hells full of little Stones, which gingle and rattle as they go, and about their Arms Armlets call'd <HI>Mapouyh-couaychovare;</HI> all which are curiou&s;ly checker'd with various colour'd Feathers.</P>

<P>Singular Friends and Relations Fea&s;t one another daily; but they are cruel and revengeful again&s;t their neighboring Enemies, whom, when they take any of them, they fatten, kill, and eat. The lea&s;t affront done them, or injurious word &s;poken to them, or again&s;t their Predece&s;&s;orss, makes them take up Arms, which con&s;i&s;t of Bowes and Arrows, which they call <HI>Ouyrapar</HI> and <HI>Oune.</HI></P>

<PB N="608" REF="408">and for the &s;pace of two hundred Leagues &s;aw neither Man nor Hou&s;e: Next Land|ing at a Village, he was by the Governor thereof Pre&s;ented with Turtles, Par|tridpes, Fi&s;h, and other Provi&s;ions, and al&s;o forewarn'd of the valiant Women, the <HI>Amazones,</HI> which they call'd <HI>Camapuyara.</HI> Going from hence, he met for eighty Leagues together, nothing but &s;teep and craggy Mountains on each &s;ide of the Shore, in&s;omuch that he could not Land any where for Provi&s;ions. Next coming to the inhabited Province <HI>Machiparo,</HI> he was fiercely a&s;&s;aulted for two days and two nights, by the Ca&s;ique <HI>Aomagua,</HI> who pur&s;u'd him with &s;everal Boats: Not long after having conquer'd a Village, out of which ran &s;everal trodden Paths into the Countrey, he came to a River, in the Mouth whereof there lying three I&s;les, he gave it the Denomination of <HI>La Trinidad,</HI> which wa&s;heth a fruitful Coa&s;t, along which Sail'd divers &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els.

<P>The Seamen who went under <HI>Hendrick Brewer's</HI> Command, <HI>Anno</HI> 1643. from <HI>Bra&s;ile</HI> to <HI>Chili,</HI> brought the fore-mention'd Vocabulary along with them.</P>
<P><HI>Chili</HI> is look'd upon as no way inferior to any Countrey in <HI>America,</HI> enjoying a whol&s;om Air, fruitful Soil, and abundance of Inhabitants, who often furni&s;h <HI>Peru</HI> with Provi&s;ions; which are the &s;peedier convey'd thither, becau&s;e the South-Winds always blow along the Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Peruvian</HI> Vice-Roy keeps a Deputy to Govern here. It hath two Bi&s;hop|ricks, <HI>viz.</HI> St. <HI>Jago</HI> and <HI>L' Imperial.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Nature, Cu&s;toms, and Manners of the <HI>Chile&s;es.</HI></NOTE>Some of the <HI>Chile&s;es</HI> are under the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Juri&s;diction, and live in Huts; others being wilder, defend their Freedom with the Sword. They have great Heads and flat No&s;es: The Men continually pull out the Hair on their Faces and Privities with Shells, which they carry about their Necks for that purpo&s;e, having beforehand rubb'd the Hair with warm A&s;hes; the Hair of their Heads hanging downwards is cut clo&s;e as far as their Ears, the re&s;t growing long, is ty'd with the Ribbon <HI>Tariwelonco,</HI> to which Per&s;ons of Quality fix Silver Plates and <HI>Turkoi&s;es:</HI> Some al&s;o cover their Heads with the Skins of Weazels, or the like Bea&s;ts, putting the Head over their Foreheads, and the Tail down their Neck; which kind of Co|vering they call <HI>Maniewelonco:</HI> Others wear Caps made after &s;ome &s;trange manner or other.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chile&s;es</HI> are not the talle&s;t, but &s;trong and well &s;et, betwixt a white and &s;allow colour: Tho&s;e that are in the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Service, wear long Hair, by which they are di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the &s;horn <HI>Ucais,</HI> who do the <HI>Spaniards</HI> all the mi&s;chief imaginable. The Women are for the mo&s;t part low of &s;tature, but of a &s;trong Con&s;titution; they go bare-headed, letting their Hair hang loo&s;e over their Shoul|ders, except when they are indi&s;pos'd, and then they tie it up: But tho&s;e that dwell about <HI>Ca&s;tro</HI> wear Locks like our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ladies. In <HI>Coquimbo</HI> and <HI>Loquimbo</HI> they go after the &s;ame manner as the <HI>Peruvian</HI> Women: All of them have thick black Hair.</P>
<P>Their Apparel, though mean, is neat: The Men wear wide Breeches girt about their Wa&s;tes, and a piece of woollen Cloth, three Yards long and two broad, which
<PB N="641" REF="428">having a Hole in the middle, they put over their Heads, and &s;o let it hang on their Shoulders, leaving their Arms and Legs bare; but on Fe&s;tival Days they wear curious embroider'd Stockings. The Women likewi&s;e cover them&s;elves with the &s;ame piece of Cloth, but after another manner, tying it fir&s;t about their Middle, then let it down to the Ground, pinn'd before with Silver or Golden Pins; their Heads, Brea&s;ts and Legs are uncover'd; the Cloth it &s;elf is &s;trip'd with red, white, blue, and yellow, and fring'd at the edges. For an Example of their quick and ea&s;ie Labor, <HI>Hendrick Brewer</HI> relates, That a Woman being Deliver'd in his Ship, within an hour after walk'd up and down the Deck, and gave the Child &s;uck. Some of them have &s;uch great Brea&s;ts, that throwing them over their Shoulders they &s;uckle their Children, being ty'd at their Backs.</P>
<P>Their Huts being low, are made of Straw, Canes, and Boughs, and not built for one &s;ingle Family; for often thirty, fifty, a hundred, or a hundred and twenty dwell under one Roof, and have a Governor, by them call'd <HI>Caruca.</HI></P>
<P>Their Hou&s;hold&s;tuff is little and mean, <HI>viz.</HI> two or three Cans to keep their Li|quor <HI>Chica</HI> in, Horn Cups, a Stone whereon they grind their Corn, and one or two woodden Stools: The chiefe&s;t of them al&s;o u&s;e Sheep-skins, which they &s;pread on the Ground before their Gue&s;ts. They live without care, for they neither Sowe nor Plant any more than will &s;erve them a Year.</P>
<P>Their Riches con&s;i&s;t in Cattel, of which they have no great plenty.</P>
<P>About the beginning of <HI>October</HI> a whole Town meets together to Plough and to Sowe, which the Men perform in two days time, the re&s;t of the Work being left to the care of the Women; for the Men never meddle with Reaping or Harve&s;t.</P>
<P>They eat and drink from Morning to Evening, when they do not travel, for then they eat at &s;et-times. Their Liquor is made of Barley-Meal, or Wheat boyl'd in Water. On Fe&s;tival Days they drink <HI>Chica,</HI> Brew'd of <HI>Maiz</HI> chew'd by the Teeth of old Women. They likewi&s;e make a Liquor of the Fruit <HI>Unni,</HI> which ta&s;tes like <HI>Madera</HI> Wine.</P>
<P>Every Man Marries as many Wives as he can buy and maintain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Mar|riages.</NOTE> for Maids and Widows mu&s;t be &s;old by the Parents, who &s;et not a Price upon them according to their Beauty or Quality, but their skill in managing Hou&s;hold Affairs. Their Marriages are perform'd after a &s;trange manner: A Son having no Inheritance, lives on the Charity of his neare&s;t Relations, who Pre&s;ent him, one with a Hog, another with a Cow, a third with a Sheep, and a fourth with &s;omewhat el&s;e: thus enrich'd, he goes to his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es Father, and hangs &s;ome <HI>Turkoi&s;es</HI> and Plates of Silver about his Neck, and acquainting him with what E&s;tate he can make his Wife, he agrees as well as he can with his intended Father-in-law, to whom he gives ten, fifty, or a hundred Sheep, Oxen, Cows, Hogs, Hor&s;es, Poultrey, a Coat, and &s;ome Ve&s;&s;els full of <HI>Chica;</HI> which done, the Father leads his Daughter to the Bridegroom's Hou&s;e, where he is Entertain'd with Meat, but finds the Drink at his own Co&s;t. Some days after the Celebration of the Wedding, the neare&s;t Relati|ons come to congratulate the young Marry'd Woman, and at Dinner &s;ing an <HI>Epi|thalamium</HI> to their Nuptial Deity <HI>Maruapeante,</HI> all of them &s;itting on the Ground on Sheep-skins. The Allies often take away a Woman from her Husband, e&s;pecially when he mi&s;u&s;es her; and if a Man kill his Wife, her Death is reveng'd by her Rela|tions. Per&s;ons of Quality build a Hut for every one of their Wives, &s;ending word to her whom they have a mind to enjoy: They re&s;pect one above the re&s;t, who are in a manner but Slave&s;&s;es, being forc'd to do all the Drudgery. The Men are exceeding jealous and chollerick, cruelly beating their Wives, if they chance but to look on another Man; and if they take them in the Act of Adultery, they im|mediately
<PB N="642" REF="429">kill them; yet for all this they are not Cha&s;te, but very Libidinous. As &s;oon as a Woman is Deliver'd of a Child, &s;he wa&s;hes her &s;elf and the Child in cold Water; then kills a Lamb call'd <HI>Chiluraque,</HI> and makes a Fea&s;t; at which &s;he her &s;elf eats and drinks freely among&s;t the re&s;t, and the next day goes about her u&s;ual Employment.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> tell us, that their Women, if they continue long in this Countrey, are more and more hardned by the Air, and are as little concern'd at the Birth of a Child as the Natives.</P>
<P>A Widow hath free leave to Marry again, provided &s;he hath given to her Chil|dren part of what &s;he hath; but if &s;he Marry not, but return to her Parents, then &s;he is highly e&s;teem'd of.</P>
<P>Both Men and Women wa&s;h them&s;elves in the Rivers in the colde&s;t Weather.</P>
<P>They adore chiefly their Deity <HI>Pillan,</HI> and the Devil, who doth them much hurt. They acknowledge no Re&s;urrection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Reli|gion, and manner of burying their Dead.</NOTE> accounting long Life in this World the greate&s;t Good; wherefore when any one dies, the Friends and Relations make a doleful Cry, and &s;uffer the dead Body to lie three, nay, four Moneths before they bury them, &s;tuffing them full of &s;trong &s;melling Herbs, to keep them from putrifying: Three days before their Interrment the neare&s;t Allies meet, kill a Sheep, make Merry, and throw the Body into a Hole near the Hut in which the Decea&s;ed dwelt, putting al&s;o a piece of the &s;lain Sheep, and a Jug full of the Liquor <HI>Chica,</HI> into the Grave.</P>
<P>Concerning their Idol <HI>Pillan,</HI> to whom with &s;trange Ge&s;tures they Sing divers Songs, they believe that he is a Spirit of the Air, and Governs all things on Earth. Some &s;uppo&s;e him to be Thunder, and therefore they wor&s;hip him in a mo&s;t par|ticular manner when they hear it Thunder; for then they &s;tick an Arrow and Stone Ax into the Ground, and take Arms into their Hands, putting them&s;elves into a po&s;ture as if they &s;hould &s;uddenly be &s;et upon by a mighty Enemy, and look'd upon it heretofore as a fore-running of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> approach, who&s;e Cruel|ties they exceedingly dreaded.</P>
<P>They call all their Hero's <HI>Pillans,</HI> and a&s;cribe Divine powers to them.</P>
<P>They take very much &s;trong Tobacco, the Smoak whereof puffing in the Air with &s;trange Ge&s;tures, they cry, <HI>Receive this, O Pillan.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their cruel u&s;age of Pri&s;oners.</NOTE>When they return home Conquerors from any Victory, they put a Stone Ax into the Ground, and &s;tanding Arm'd round about the &s;ame, Drink exceedingly, and &s;ing a Song in honor of <HI>Pillan.</HI> They u&s;e their Pri&s;oners very cruelly, for forcing them to Dance and make Merry among&s;t them, they on a &s;udden cleave their Heads with an Ax, pull their Hearts out of their Bodies, and bite the &s;ame with their Teeth.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A particular Account of <HI>Chili.</HI></NOTE>As touching the Climate and Production of <HI>Chili,</HI> this Account is given by an Eye-witne&s;s: <Q>The Winter Sea&s;on (&s;aith he) is &s;o tempe&s;tuous, that &s;ometimes the Trees are not onely blown up by the Roots, but the Earth it &s;elf is rent a&s;un|der; &s;ome Valleys being fill'd with Snow, &s;well the Rivers exceedingly when it melts, which overflowing part of the Countrey, makes the &s;ame very fruitful. It is al&s;o extream cold here, becau&s;e &s;uch &s;harp Winds blow from the Moun|tains, that they pierce through the Skin and Fle&s;h of a Man: and indeed the&s;e Winds would make the whole Countrey de&s;olate, were not the Mountains over|grown with great Oaken Trees, again&s;t which the Wind breaks. Moreover, the Valleys produce Coals, which &s;erve the Inhabitants for Fewel. The Winter be|reaves the Trees of Leaves; but not tho&s;e which grow in the Wilderne&s;&s;es. In <HI>March</HI> the Fields are full of innumerable &s;orts of &s;weet-&s;melling Flowers; out of &s;ome whereof are boyl'd the <HI>Angel-Water,</HI> &s;o call'd for its &s;mell and whol&s;om ta&s;te. The Gra&s;s grows in <HI>November</HI> and <HI>December</HI> as high as our &s;tanding Corn. Turnips, Mint, Clover, and Mu&s;tard-&s;eed, grow naturally for &s;everal Leagues together. Likewi&s;e excellent Phy&s;ical Herbs grow here, who&s;e power and ope|ration their Doctors, call'd <HI>Maci,</HI> keep from the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> The&s;e <HI>Maci</HI> are in great
<PB N="644" REF="430">e&s;teem, not onely among&s;t the <HI>Chile&s;es,</HI> but al&s;o the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> for their great skill in Phy&s;ick. Among&s;t the&s;e Herbs the chiefe&s;t is call'd <HI>Quincia-mali</HI> which grows but half a hands-breadth above the Ground, and &s;preads into &s;everal Stalks like a No&s;egay; and on each Stalk is a Saffron-colour'd Flower. This Herb pull'd up with the Root, and boyl'd, and the Decoction given to any one that is bruis'd within, works mo&s;t wonderfully, for it draws out the putrifi'd. Blood, though &s;unk never &s;o deep in the Wound. Moreover the Juice of <HI>Culen</HI> is al&s;o very healing, if us'd for an Ointment, or pour'd on any Wound. This Herb, by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> call'd <HI>Albaciga,</HI> hath &s;weet-&s;melling Leaves, and a tall Body. In &s;ome places al&s;o grows an Herb, not unlike Gra&s;s, which boyl'd in Water, immedi|ately cures the Feaver and Spleen, and clean&s;es the Blood. There are likewi&s;e Medicines here, which di&s;&s;olving the Stone in the Bladder or Kidneys, cau&s;e it to be urin'd forth.

<P>The Wilderne&s;s <HI>Atacama,</HI> which makes a Boundary betwixt <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Chili,</HI> extends Northward ninety Leagues, is dry and barren in Summer, and in the Winter ex|ceeding cold, and cover'd with Snow. No Provi&s;ion is to be found upon it, except a few wild Sheep, call'd <HI>Guanacos.</HI> About the middle thereof the Brook <HI>La Sal</HI> ri&s;ing in the Ea&s;tern Mountains, flows We&s;tward through a deep Valley to the Southern Ocean.</P>

<P>In the Valley <HI>Chili,</HI> which gives Denomination to the whole Countrey, were formerly the famous Gold-Mines <HI>Quillatas,</HI> from whence <HI>Valdivia,</HI> Anno 1544, car|ry'd an invaluable Trea&s;ure. The South Sea makes here a large and convenient Harbor for all manner of Ve&s;&s;els, built two Leagues below the City <HI>Serena,</HI> at a lit|tle River, which &s;o moi&s;tens the low Countrey, that it produces all manner of Plants. It rains here not above three times ayear.</P>
<P>From the Entertainment which Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> met withal here, may &s;uffici|ently be conjectur'd the Power of <HI>Serena;</HI> for when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Landed here for Water, they were driven away not without great lo&s;s by three hundred <HI>Ca&s;tilian</HI> Hor&s;e, and two hundred Foot that Sally'd out of the City. The Mines, though they inclo&s;e much Gold, yet they produce but little, becau&s;e the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> accord|ing to the te&s;timony of a <HI>Chilean</HI> Pilot, whom <HI>Oliver van Noort</HI> took Pri&s;oner, de|&s;troy'd all the ancient Inhabitants that &s;hould have help'd them to dig the Gold.</P>
<P>The City <HI>St. Jago,</HI> lying near the Stream <HI>Topocalma,</HI> receives great benefit by the Haven <HI>Valparay&s;o,</HI> which makes the fore-mention'd River, becau&s;e in that Haven all Goods that come from <HI>Lima</HI> are unladen, and the Goods &s;hipp'd aboard. The Countrey about the &s;ame produces plenty of Wines, Apples, Corn, and all &s;orts of Cattel, and e&s;pecially Hor&s;es in &s;uch abundance, that thou&s;ands of them run wild.</P>
<P>In <HI>Valparay&s;o</HI> Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> took a Ship from <HI>Valdivia,</HI> laden with two thou|&s;and five hundred Bars of fine Gold. But the <HI>Netherland</HI> Admiral, <HI>Joris Spilbergen,</HI> had not &s;uch good &s;ucce&s;s, who Sailing thither with five Ships, <HI>Anno</HI> 1615. di&s;co|ver'd a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ship in the Harbor; where &s;ending his Boats well Mann'd to fetch off a Ve&s;&s;el that lay hal'd on the Shore, they found it burning, and thereupon Steer'd their Cour&s;e into a little Inlet full of Rocks, which &s;erv'd the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in &s;tead of Brea&s;t-works; for lying behind them, they fir'd continually on the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> yet <HI>Spilbergen</HI> Landing with two hundred Men, met a con&s;iderable number of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Soldiers, and Hor&s;es drawn out on the Shore, from whom they &s;oon fled.</P>
<P>Before the City <HI>La Conception</HI> lies the I&s;land <HI>Quiriquyna,</HI> who&s;e Straw Huts <HI>Spilber|gen</HI> laid in A&s;hes.</P>
<P>At the time when <HI>Oliver van Noort</HI> came to an Anchor here, the Governor <HI>Fran|ci&s;cus de Quinones</HI> Commanded &s;even hundred <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Soldiers to reduce the revolted <HI>Chile&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>Four Leagues from <HI>Conception</HI> lie the rich Gold-Mines <HI>Quilacoya,</HI> which formerly produc'd great Riches.</P>
<P>Over again&s;t the Valley <HI>Arauco,</HI> which ri&s;es out of the Sea, lies the I&s;land <HI>Maria,</HI> in a large Inlet made by the force of the Waves.</P>
<P>Here grows abundance of Wheat and Barley. The Rivers al&s;o afford plenty of Fi&s;h, among&s;t which there is one call'd <HI>The Lake-Spider,</HI> in who&s;e Eyes are to be &s;een little Specks, which would exceed Pearl, if they were but hard enough.</P>
<P>Two <HI>Spaniards</HI> Command forty Natives on <HI>Maria,</HI> and keep them in &s;uch &s;lavery, that they may neither eat Apples, Pears, Grapes, Poultrey, or Sheep, though they are there in great abundance.</P>
<P><HI>Elias Herkmans</HI> was once in probability to have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this I&s;land for the <HI>Netherland</HI> State, had he not been prevented by an extraordinary occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Between the Towns <HI>Conception</HI> and <HI>Imperial</HI> lie the Provinces <HI>Arauco, Tucapel,</HI> and <HI>Puren,</HI> inhabited by a valiant People, that often alarm the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> In each Pro|vince <HI>Valdivia</HI> built a Fort in the Year 1551. eight Leagues di&s;tant from one another.
