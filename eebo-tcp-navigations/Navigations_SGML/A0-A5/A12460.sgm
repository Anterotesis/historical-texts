<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF
New-England, by Captaine
Iohn Smith.</HEAD>
<P>_IN the moneth of Aprill,<NOTE PLACE="marg">My fir&s;t voy|age to new-England.</NOTE> 1614.
with two Ships from <HI>London,</HI> of
a few Marchants, I chanced to ar|riue
in <HI>New-England,</HI> a parte of
<HI>Ameryca,</HI> at the Ile of <HI>Monahig|gan,</HI>
in 43 of Northerly lati|tude:
our plot was there to take Whales and make
tryalls of a Myne of Gold and Copper. If tho&s;e fai|led,
Fi&s;h and Furres was then our refuge, to make
our &s;elues &s;auers how&s;oeuer: we found this Whale|fi&s;hing
a co&s;tly conclu&s;ion: we &s;aw many, and &s;pent
much time in cha&s;ing them; but could not kill any:
They beeing a kinde of Iubartes, and not the
Whale that yeeldes Finnes and Oyle as wee expec|ted.
For our Golde, it was rather the Ma&s;ters de|uice
to get a voyage that proiected it, then any
knowledge hee had at all of any &s;uch matter. Fi&s;h
&amp; Furres was now our guard: &amp; by our late arriual,
and long lingring about the Whale, the prime of
both tho&s;e &s;ea&s;ons were pa&s;t ere wee perceiued it;
we thinking that their &s;ea&s;ons &s;erued at all times:
<PB N="2" REF="10">
but wee found it otherwi&s;e; for, by the mid&s;t
of Iune, the fi&s;hing failed. Yet in Iuly and Augu&s;t
&s;ome was taken, but not &s;ufficient to defray &s;o great
a charge as our &s;tay required. Of dry fi&s;h we made
about 40000. of Cor fi&s;h about 7000. While&s;t
the &s;ailers fi&s;hed, my &s;elfe with eight or nine others
of them might be&s;t bee &s;pared; Ranging the coa&s;t
in a &s;mall boat, wee got for trifles neer 1100 Beuer
&s;kinnes, 100 Martins, and neer as many Otters;
and the mo&s;t of them within the di&s;tance of twenty
leagues. We ranged the Coa&s;t both Ea&s;t and We&s;t

<P>But,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A de&s;cription of the Coun|tries in particu|lar, and their &s;ituations.</NOTE> to returne a little more to the particulars

Territories, and Limitations, Friends, and Foes:
but, as I gathered from the niggardly relations in a
broken language to my vnder&s;tanding, during
the time I ranged tho&s;e Countries &amp;c. The mo&s;t
Northren part I was at, was the Bay of <HI>Pennob|&s;cot,</HI>
which is Ea&s;t and We&s;t, North and South,
more then ten leagues: but &s;uch were my occa&s;ions,
I was con&s;trained to be &s;atisfied of them I found
in the Bay, that the Riuer ranne farre vp into the
Land, and was well inhabited with many people,
but they were from their habitations, either fi&s;h|ing
<PB N="24" REF="21">
among the Iles, or hunting the Lakes and
Woods, for Deer and Beners. The Bay is full of
great Ilands, of one, two, &s;ix, eight, or ten miles in
length, which diuides it into many faire and excel|lent
good harbours. On the Ea&s;t of it, are the <HI>Tar|rantines,</HI>
their mortall enemies, where inhabit the
<HI>French,</HI> as they report that liue with tho&s;e people,
as one nation or family. And Northwe&s;t of <HI>Pen|nob&s;cot</HI>
is <HI>Mecaddacut,</HI> at the foot of a high moun|taine,
a kinde of fortre&s;&s;e again&s;t the <HI>Tarrantines,</HI>
adioyning to the high mountaines of <HI>Pennob&s;cot,</HI>
again&s;t who&s;e feet doth beat the Sea: But ouer all
the Land, Iles, or other impediments, you may
well &s;ee them &s;ixteene or eighteene leagues from
their &s;ituation. <HI>Segocket</HI> is the next; then <HI>Nu&s;concus,
Pemmaquid,</HI> and <HI>Sagadahock.</HI> Vp this Riuer where
was the We&s;terne plantation are <HI>Aumuckcawgen,
Kinnebeck,</HI> and diuers others, where there is plan|ted
&s;ome corne fields. Along this Riuer 40 or 50
miles, I &s;aw nothing but great high cliffes of bar|ren
Rocks, ouergrowne with wood: but where
the Saluages dwelt there the ground is exceeding
fat &amp; fertill. We&s;tward of this Riuer, is the Coun|trey
of <HI>Aucoci&s;co,</HI> in the bottome of a large deepe
Bay, full of many great Iles, which diuides it into
many good harbours. <HI>Sowocotuck</HI> is the next, in
the edge of a large &s;andy Bay, which hath many
Rocks and Iles, but few good harbours, but for
Barks, I yet know. But all this Coa&s;t to <HI>Pennob|&s;cot,</HI>
and as farre I could &s;ee Ea&s;tward of it is no|thing
but &s;uch high craggy Cliffy Rocks &amp; &s;tony
<PB N="25" REF="21">
Iles that I wondered &s;uch great trees could growe
vpon &s;o hard foundations. It is a Countrie rather
to affright, then delight one. And how to de&s;cribe a
more plaine &s;pectacle of de&s;olation or more barren
I knowe not. Yet the Sea there is the &s;trange&s;t fi&s;h|pond
I euer &s;aw; and tho&s;e barren Iles &s;o furni&s;hed
with good woods, &s;prings, fruits, fi&s;h, and foule,
that it makes mee thinke though the Coa&s;t be roc|kie,
and thus affrightable; the Vallies, Plaines, and
and interior parts, may well (notwith&s;tanding) be
verie fertile. But there is no kingdome &s;o fertile hath
not &s;ome part barren: and <HI>New England</HI> is great e|nough,
to make many Kingdomes and Countries,
were it all inhabited. As you pa&s;&s;e the Coa&s;t &s;till
We&s;tward, <HI>Accominticus</HI> and <HI>Pa&s;&s;ataquack</HI> are two
conuenient harbors for &s;mall barks; and a good

next; This place might content a right curious
iudgement: but there are many &s;ands at the en|trance
of the harbor: and the wor&s;t is, it is inbay|ed
too farre from the deepe Sea. Heere are many
ri&s;ing hilles, and on their tops and de&s;cents many
corne fields, and delightfull groues. On the Ea&s;t,
is an Ile of two or three leagues in length; the one
halfe, plaine mori&s;h gra&s;&s;e fit for pa&s;ture, with ma|ny

North of this, doth enter a great Bay, where wee
founde &s;ome habitations and corne fields: they re|port
a great Riuer, and at lea&s;t thirtie habitations,
doo po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e this Countrie. But becau&s;e the <HI>French</HI>
had got their Trade, I had no lea&s;ure to di&s;couer it.
The Iles of <HI>Mattahunts</HI> are on the We&s;t &s;ide of this
Bay, where are many Iles, and que&s;tionle&s;&s;e good
harbors: and then the Countrie of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu|&s;ets,</HI>
which is the Paradi&s;e of all tho&s;e parts: for,
heere are many Iles all planted with corne; groues,
mulberries, &s;aluage gardens, and good harbors:
the Coa&s;t is for the mo&s;t part, high clayie &s;andie
cliffs. The Sea Coa&s;t as you pa&s;&s;e, &s;hewes you all
along large corne fields, and great troupes of well
proportioned people: but the <HI>French</HI> hauing re|mained
heere neere &s;ixe weekes, left nothing, for vs
to take occa&s;ion to examine the inhabitants relati|ons,
<HI>viz.</HI> if there be neer three thou&s;and people vp|on
the&s;e Iles; and that the Riuer doth pearce many
daies iourneies the intralles of that Countrey. We
found the people in tho&s;e parts verie kinde; but in
their furie no le&s;&s;e valiant. For, vpon a quarrell wee
had with one of them, hee onely with three others
cro&s;&s;ed the harbor of <HI>Quonaha&s;sit</HI> to certaine rocks
whereby wee mu&s;t pa&s;&s;e; and there let flie their ar|rowes
for our &s;hot, till we were out of danger.</P>
<P>Then come you to <HI>Accomack,</HI> an excellent good

indu&s;trious people. After much kindne&s;&s;e, vpon a

but an excellent harbor for all weathers. This <HI>Cape</HI>
is made by the maine Sea on the one &s;ide, and a
great Bay on the other in forme of a &s;ickle: on it
doth inhabit the people of <HI>Pawmet:</HI> and in the bot|tome
of the Bay, the people of <HI>Chawum.</HI> Towards
the South and Southwe&s;t of this <HI>Cape,</HI> is found a

&s;o farte as I incircled it, I found thirtie fadom wa|ter

we want, or it co&s;teth vs dearely. What plea&s;ure
can be more, then (being tired with any occa&s;ion
a-&s;hore) in planting Vines, Fruits, or Hearbs, in
contriuing their owne Grounds, to the plea&s;ure
of their owne mindes, their Fields, Gardens, Or|chards,
Buildings, Ships, and other works, &amp;c. to
recreate them&s;elues before their owne doores, in
their owne boates vpon the Sea, where man wo|man
and childe, with a &s;mall hooke and line, by
angling, may take diuer&s;e &s;orts of excellent fi&s;h, at
their plea&s;ures? And is it not pretty &s;port, to pull
vp two pence, &s;ix pence, and twelue pence, as fa&s;t
as you can hale and veare a line? He is a very bad
fi&s;her, cannot kill in one day with his hooke and
line, one, two, or three hundred Cods: which dre&s;|&s;ed
and dryed, if they be &s;ould there for ten &s;hil|lings
the hundred, though in <HI>England</HI> they will
giue more then twentie; may not both the &s;er|uant,
the ma&s;ter, and marchant, be well content
with this gaine? If a man worke but three dayes
in &s;eauen, he may get more then hee can &s;pend,
vnle&s;&s;e he will be exce&s;siue. Now that Carpenter,
Ma&s;on, Gardiner, Taylor, Smith, Sailer, Forgers,
or what other, may they not make this a pretty
recreation though they fi&s;h but an houre in a day,
to take more then they eate in a weeke: or? if they
will not eate it, becau&s;e there is &s;o much better

choi&s;e; yet &s;ell it, or change it, with the fi&s;her men,

hurt or charge then angling with a hooke, and
cro&s;sing the &s;weete ayre from Ile to Ile, ouer the
&s;ilent &s;treames of a calme Sea? wherein the mo&s;t

The maine a&s;&s;i&s;tance next God, I had to this &s;mall

e&s;pecially, with <HI>Dohannida,</HI> one of their grea|te&s;t

meanes of this proud Saluage, I did not doubt but
quickly to haue gotte that credit with the re&s;t of
his friends, and alliants, to haue had as many of
them, as I de&s;ired in any de&s;igne I intended, and
that trade al&s;o they had, by &s;uch a kind of exchange
<PB N="46" REF="33">
of their Countrie commodities; which both with
ea&s;e &amp; &s;ecuritie in their &s;ea&s;ons may be v&s;ed. With
him and diuer&s;e others, I had concluded to inhabit,
and defend them again&s;t the <HI>Terentynes;</HI> with a bet|ter
power then the <HI>French</HI> did them; who&s;e tyranny
did inforce them to imbrace my offer, with no
&s;mall deuotion. And though many may thinke me
more bolde then wi&s;e, in regard of their power,
dexteritie, treacherie, and incon&s;tancie, hauing &s;o

difference, betwixt the directions and iudgement
of experimentall knowledge, and the &s;uperficiall
coniecture of variable relation: wherein rumor, hu|mor,
or mi&s;prision haue &s;uch power, that oft times
one is enough to beguile twentie, but twentie not
&s;ufficient to keep one from being deceiued. There|fore

la&s;t wee betrayed Captaine <HI>Wolli&s;ton</HI> (his Liefte|nant)
and foure or fiue of their men aboard vs, and
then prouided to take the re&s;t perforce. Now my
part was to be pri&s;oner in the gun-roum, &amp; not to

knowledge what I was. Then <HI>Barra</HI> perceiuing wel
the&s;e <HI>French</HI> intents, made ready to fight, and <HI>Wol|li&s;ton</HI>
as re&s;olutely regarded not their threats,
<PB N="55" REF="37">
which cau&s;ed vs demurre vpon the matter longer,
&s;om &s;ixteene houres; and then returned their pri|&s;oners,

&s;eauen pence a peece. Not long after, wee tooke a

had better fortune then the other. For, hauing but
taken a boats loading of &s;uger, marmelade, &s;uckets,

we &s;tood; who forling their maine &s;ayles attended
vs to fight. But our <HI>French</HI> &s;pirits were content
onely to perceiue they were <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> red cro&s;les.
Within a very &s;mall time after, wee cha&s;ed foure

they did, or e&s;teeme our &s;elues too good to take the
like paines. Was it vertue in them, to prouide that
doth maintaine vs? and ba&s;ene&s;&s;e for vs to doe the
like for others? Surely no. Then &s;eeing we are not
borne for our &s;elues, but each to helpe other, and
our abilities are much alike at the houre of our
birth, and the minute of our death: Seeing our
good deedes, or our badde, by faith in Chri&s;ts me|rits,
is all we haue to carrie our &s;oules to heauen, or
hell: Seeing honour is our liues ambition; and our
ambition after death, to haue an honourable
memorie of our life: and &s;eeing by noe
meanes wee would bee abated of the
dignities &amp; glories of our Prede|ce&s;&s;ors;
let vs imitate their
vertues to bee wor|thily
their &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors.</P>
