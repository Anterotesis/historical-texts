<P>THE Reverend Author's Reflexions upon <HI>Varilla</HI>'s his Hi&s;tory of He|re&s;ie, having met with the Reception owing to the merit of all his Productions, has made me &s;en&s;ible, that I can never mount to a higher &s;train of obliging the Publick, than in Continuing to entertain it with the Ma&s;terly pieces of the &s;ame hand; this Con&s;ideration induc'd me to go to Work upon the&s;e his incomparable <HI>Travelling Remarks,</HI> and having in this, as well as I had in the <HI>Reflexions,</HI> the advantage of an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Gentleman to Correct and Over-&s;ee the Pre&s;s, this

<HEAD>LETTER I. <HI>Zurich,</HI> the Fir&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> 1685.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is &s;o common to write Travels, that for one who has &s;een &s;o little, and as it were in ha&s;te, it may look like a pre&s;umptuous Affectation to be reckoned among Voyagers, if he attempts to &s;ay any thing upon &s;o &s;hort a Ramble, and concerning Places &s;o much vi&s;ited, and by con&s;equence &s;o well
<PB N="2" REF="4"> known: Yet having had opportunities that do not of|fer them&s;elves to all that travel, and having joyned to tho&s;e a curio&s;ity almo&s;t equal to the advantages I en|joyed, I fancy it will not be an ungrateful Entertain|ment, if I give you &s;ome account of tho&s;e things that plea&s;ed me mo&s;t in the Places through which I have pa&s;&s;ed: but I will avoid &s;aying &s;uch things as occurr in ordinary Books, for which I refer you to the Prints; for as you know that I have no great inclination to co|py what others have &s;aid; &s;o a Traveller has not lei|&s;ure nor humour enough for &s;o dull an Employment.</P>
<P>As I came all the way from <HI>Paris</HI> to <HI>Lyons,</HI> I was amazed to &s;ee &s;o much mi&s;ery as appeared, not only in Villages, but even in big Towns, where all the marks of an extream Poverty, &s;hewed them<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">elves both in the Buildings, the Cloaths, and almo&s;t in the Looks of the Inhabitants. And a general di&s;-peopling in all the Towns, was a very vi&s;ible effect of the hard&s;hips under which they lay.</P>
<P>I need tell you nothing of the irregular and yet mag|nificent Situation of <HI>Lyons,</HI> of the noble Rivers that meet there, of the Rock cut from &s;o va&s;t a height for a Pri&s;on, of the <HI>Carthu&s;ians</HI> Gardens, of the Town-Hou&s;e, of the Je&s;uits Colledge and Library, of the fa|mous Nunnery of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> of the Churches, particu|larly St. <HI>Irenees,</HI> of the Remnants of the <HI>Aqueducts,</HI> of the Columns and the old Mo&s;aick in the Abbey Dean: in &s;hort, Mr. <HI>Spon</HI> has given &s;uch an account of the Cu|rio&s;ities there, that it were a very pre&s;umptuous At|tempt to offer to come after him.</P>
<P>The Speech of <HI>Claudius</HI> ingraven on a Plate of Bra&s;s, and &s;et in the end of the low Walk in the Town-hou&s;e, is one of the noble&s;t Antiquities in the World; by which we &s;ee the way of Writing and Pointing in that Age very copiou&s;ly. The Shield of Silver of twenty two pound weight, in which &s;ome Remains of gilding do yet appear, and that &s;eems to repre&s;ent that gene|rous Action of <HI>Scipio</HI>'s, of re&s;toring a fair Captive to a
<PB N="3" REF="4"> <HI>Celtiberian</HI> Prince, is certainly the noble&s;t piece of Plate that is now extant: the embo&s;&s;ing of it is &s;o fine and &s;o entire, that it is indeed unvaluable; and if there were an In&s;cription upon it to put us beyond conje|cture, it were yet much more ine&s;timable.</P>
<P>A great many In&s;criptions are to be &s;een of the late and barbarous Ages, as <HI>Bonum Memorium,</HI> and <HI>Epita|phium hunc.</HI> There are twenty three In&s;criptions in the Garden of the Fathers of <HI>Mercy,</HI> but &s;o placed as it &s;hews how little tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s them do either un|der&s;tand or value them. I &s;hall only give you one, be|cau&s;e I made a little Reflection on it, tho' it is not per|haps too well grounded, becau&s;e none of the Criticks have thought on it.</P>
<P>The In&s;cription is this, <HI>D. M. Et Memoriae AEternae Sutiae Anthidis. Quae vixit Annis XXV. M. XI. DV. Quae dum Nimia pia fuit, facta est Impia: &amp; Attio Pro|batiolo, Cecalius Cali&s;tio Conjux &amp; Pater, &amp; &s;ibi vivo ponendum curavit &amp; &s;ub a&s;cia dedicavit.</HI> This mu&s;t be towards the barbarous Age, as appears by the fal&s;e La|tin in <HI>Nimia:</HI> But the In&s;cription &s;eems &s;o extravagant, that a man dedicating a Burial-&s;tone for his Wife and Son, and under which him&s;elf was to be laid, with Ceremonies of Religion, &s;hould tax his Wife of Im|piety, and give &s;o extraordinary an account of her becoming &s;o through an exce&s;s of Piety, that it de|&s;erves &s;ome con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>It &s;eems the Impiety was publick, otherwi&s;e a Hu&s;|band would not have recorded it in &s;uch a manner; and it is plain that he thought it ro&s;e from an exce&s;s of Piety.</P>
<P>I need not examine the Conjectures of others; but will chu&s;e rather to give you my own, and &s;ubmit it to your cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to me, that this <HI>Sutia Anthis</HI> was a Chri&s;ti|an; for the Chri&s;tians, becau&s;e they would not wor|&s;hip the Gods of the Heathens, nor participate with them in their &s;acred Rites, were accu&s;ed both of
<PB N="4" REF="5"> Athei&s;m and Impiety. This is &s;o often objected, and the Fathers in their Apologies have an&s;wered it &s;o of|ten, that it were lo&s;t labour to prove it: &s;o this Wife of <HI>Cerealius Cali&s;tio</HI> having turned Chri&s;tian, it &s;eems he thought he was bound to take &s;ome notice of it in the In&s;cription. But by it he gives a honourable Cha|racter of the Chri&s;tian Doctrine at the &s;ame time that he &s;eems to accu&s;e it; that through an exce&s;s of Piety his Wi&s;e was carried to it; &s;ince a mind &s;eriou&s;ly po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed with a true &s;en&s;e of Piety could not avoid the falling under a di&s;ta&s;te of Pagani&s;m, and the becoming Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>At <HI>Grenoble</HI> there is not much to be &s;een. The learn|ed Mr. <HI>Chorier</HI> has &s;ome Manu&s;cripts of con&s;iderable Antiquity. In one of <HI>Vegetius de re Militari,</HI> there is a clear correction of a Pa&s;&s;age that in all the printed Edi|tions is not &s;en&s;e. In the Chapter of the &s;ize of the Souldiers, he begins; <HI>Scio &s;emper men&s;uram &agrave; Mario Con&s;ule exactam: &agrave;</HI> is in no <HI>MS.</HI> and <HI>Mario Con&s;ule</HI> is a mi&s;take for <HI>trium Cubitorum,</HI> for III which are for <HI>trium</HI> have been read <HI>M.</HI> and <HI>C,</HI> which &s;tands for <HI>Cubitorum,</HI> as appears by all that follows, was by a mi&s;take read <HI>Con&s;ule;</HI> &s;o the true reading of that Pa&s;&s;age, is, <HI>Scio men&s;uram trium Cubitorum fui&s;&s;e &s;emper exactam.</HI> He &s;hewed me another <HI>MS.</HI> of about five or &s;ix hundred years old, in which St. <HI>John</HI>'s Revelation is contained, all exemplified in Figures; and after that came <HI>Ae&s;op</HI>'s Fables, likewi&s;e all de&s;igned in Figures: from which he inferred, that tho&s;e who de&s;igned tho&s;e two Books valued both equally, and &s;o put them together.</P>
<P>I will not de&s;cribe the Valley of <HI>Dauphine,</HI> all to <HI>Chambery,</HI> nor entertain you with a Landskip of the Country, which de&s;erves a better Pencil than mine, and in which the heighth and rudene&s;s of the Moun|tains that almo&s;t &s;hut upon it, together with the beau|ty, the evenne&s;s, and fruitfulne&s;s of the Valley, that is all along well watered with the River of <HI>Li&s;erre,</HI> make &s;uch an agreeable mixture, that this va&s;t diver&s;ity of
<PB N="5" REF="5"> Objects that do at once fill the Eye, gives it a very en|tertaining Pro&s;pect.</P>
<P><HI>Chambery</HI> has nothing in it that de&s;erves a long De|&s;cription; and <HI>Geneva</HI> is too well known to be much in&s;i&s;ted on. It is a little State, but it has &s;o many good Con&s;titutions in it, that the greate&s;t may ju&s;tly learn at it. The Chamber of the Corn has always two years Provi&s;ion for the City in &s;tore, and forces none but the Bakers to buy of it at a taxed price; and &s;o it is both nece&s;&s;ary for any Extremities under which the State may fall, and is likewi&s;e of great advantage; for it gives a good yearly Income, that has helpt the State to pay near a Million of Debt contracted during the Wars; and the Citizens are not oppre&s;&s;ed by it; for every Inhabitant may buy his own Corn as he plea&s;es, only Publick Hou&s;es mu&s;t buy from the Chamber. And if one will compare the faith of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Geneva</HI> toge|ther by this particular, he will be enforced to prefer the latter; for if good Works are a &s;trong pre&s;umption, if not a &s;ure Indication of a good Faith, then Ju&s;tice being a good Work of the fir&s;t form, <HI>Geneva</HI> will cer|tainly carry it.</P>
<P>At <HI>Rome,</HI> the Pope buys in all the Corn of the Patri|mony; for none of the Landlords can &s;ell it either to Merchants or Bakers. He buys it at five Crowns their Mea&s;ure, and even that is &s;lowly and ill paid; &s;o that there was eight hundred thou&s;and Crowns owing upon that &s;core when I was at <HI>Rome.</HI> In &s;elling this out, the Mea&s;ure is le&s;&s;ened a fifth part, and the price of the whole is doubled; &s;o that what was bought at five Crowns, is &s;old out at twelve: and if the Bakers, who are obliged to take a determined quantity of Corn from the Chamber, cannot retail out all that is impo|&s;ed upon them, but are forced to return &s;ome part of it back, the Chamber di&s;counts to them only the fir&s;t price of five Crowns: whereas in <HI>Geneva</HI> the mea&s;ure by which they buy and &s;ell is the &s;ame; and the Gain is &s;o incon&s;iderable, that it is very little beyond the
<PB N="6" REF="6"> common Market price: &s;o that upon the whole mat|ter, the Chamber of the Corn is but the Merchant to the State. But if the Publick makes a moderate Gain by the Corn, that and all the other Revenues of this &s;mall Commonwealth are &s;o well employed, that there is no cau&s;e of complaint given in the Admini&s;tration of the publick Pur&s;e; which with the advanta es that ari&s;e out of the Chamber of the Corn, is about one hundred thou&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d Crowns Revenue. But there is much to go out of this: Three hundred Souldiers are payed; an Ar&s;enal is maintained, that in proportion to the State is the greate&s;t in the World; for it con|tains Arms for more men than are in the State: there is a great number of Mini&s;ters and Profe&s;&s;ors, in all twenty four, payed out of it, be&s;ides all the publick Charges and Offices of the Government. Every one of the le&s;&s;er Council of twenty five, having a hundred Crowns, and every <HI>Syndic</HI> having two hundred Crowns Pen&s;ion: and after all this come the accidental Char|ges of the Deputies, that they are obliged to &s;end often to <HI>Paris,</HI> to <HI>Savoy,</HI> and to <HI>Zwitzerland;</HI> &s;o that it is very apparent, no man can enrich him&s;elf at the Co&s;t of the Publick. And the appointments of the little Council are a very &s;mall recompence for the great at|tendance that they are obliged to give the Publick, which is commonly four or five hours a day. The Sa|lary for the Profe&s;&s;ors and Mini&s;ters is indeed &s;mall, not above two hundred Crowns; but to ballance this, which was a more competent Provi&s;ion when it was fir&s;t &s;et off a hundred and fifty years ago, the price of all things, and the way of living, being now much heightned, tho&s;e Employments are here held in their due Reputation, and the riche&s;t Citizens in the Town breed up their Children &s;o as to qualifie them for tho&s;e Places: And a Mini&s;ter that is &s;utable to his Character, is thought &s;o good a Match, that generally they have &s;uch E&s;tates, either by Succe&s;&s;ion or Marriage, as &s;up|port them &s;utably to the rank they hold. And in
<PB N="7" REF="6"> <HI>Geneva</HI> there is &s;o great a regulation upon Expences of all &s;orts, that a &s;mall Sum goes a great way. It is a &s;urpri&s;ing thing, to &s;ee &s;o much Learning as one finds in <HI>Geneva,</HI> not only among tho&s;e who&s;e Profe&s;&s;ion ob|liges them to Study, but among the Magi&s;trates and Citizens; and if there are not many men of the fir&s;t form of Learning among them, yet every body almo&s;t here has a good tincture of a learned Education; in&s;o|much that they are Ma&s;ters of the Latin, they know the Controver&s;ies of Religion and Hi&s;tory, and they are generally men of good &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>There is an univer&s;al Civility, not only towards Strangers, but towards one another, that reigns all the Town over, and leans to an exce&s;s; &s;o that in them one &s;ees a mixture of a <HI>French</HI> Openne&s;s, and an <HI>Italian</HI> Exactne&s;s: there is indeed a little too much of the la&s;t.</P>
<P>The publick Ju&s;tice of the City is quick and good, and more commended than the private Ju&s;tice of tho&s;e that deal in Trade: a want of Sincerity is much la|mented by tho&s;e that know the Town wall. There is no publick Lewdne&s;s to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lerated, and the di&s;orders of that &s;ort are managed with great addre&s;s. And not|with&s;tanding their Neighbourhood to the <HI>Switzers,</HI> drinking is very little known among them. One of the be&s;t parts of their Law is the way of &s;elling E&s;tates; which is likewi&s;e practi&s;ed in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and is call|ed <HI>Subha&s;tation,</HI> from the <HI>Roman</HI> Cu&s;tom of &s;elling <HI>Sub+ha&s;ta.</HI> A man that is to buy an E&s;tate agrees with the Owner, and then intimates it to the Government; who order three &s;everal Proclamations to be made &s;ix Weeks one after another, of the intended Sale, that is to be on &s;uch a day: when the day comes, the Credi|tors of the Seller, if they apprehend that the E&s;tate is &s;old at an under-value, may out-bid the Buyer; but if they do not interpo&s;e, the Buyer delivers the money to the State, which upon that gives him his Title to the E&s;tate, which can never be &s;o much as brought
<PB N="8" REF="7"> under a Debate in Law; and the price is paid into the State, and is by them given either to the Debtors of the Seller, if he owes money, or to the Seller him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This Cu&s;tom prevails likewi&s;e in <HI>Swi&s;&s;e,</HI> where al&s;o twelve Years Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion gives a Pre&s;cription; &s;o that in no place of the World are the Titles to E&s;tates &s;o &s;ecure as here. The Con&s;titution of the Government is the &s;ame both in <HI>Geneva,</HI> and in mo&s;t of the <HI>Cantons.</HI> The Sovereignty lies in the Council of Two hundred, and this Council chu&s;es out of its number Twenty five, who are the le&s;&s;er Council; and the cen&s;ure of the Twenty five belongs to the great Council: they are cho&s;en by a &s;ort of Ballet; &s;o that it is not known for whom they give their Votes: which is an effectual method to &s;up|pre&s;s Factions and Re&s;entments; &s;ince in a competition no man can know who voted for him or again&s;t him: yet the Election is not &s;o carried, but that the whole Town is in an Intrigue concerning it: for &s;ince the be|ing of the little Council leads one to the <HI>Sindicat,</HI> which is the chief Honour of the State; this Dignity is court|ed here with as active and &s;ollicitous an Ambition, as appears el&s;ewhere for greater matters. The Two hun|dred are cho&s;en and cen&s;ured by the Twenty five; &s;o that the&s;e two Councils, which are both for Life, are checks one upon another. The Magi&s;tracy is in the one, and the Sovereignty in the other. The Number of Twenty five is never exceeded in the le&s;&s;er Council; but for the greater, tho' it pa&s;&s;es by the Name of the Council of Two hundred, yet there are commonly eight or ten more: &s;o that notwith&s;tanding the ab&s;ence or &s;ickne&s;s of &s;ome of the Number, they may &s;till be able to call together near the full Number. There is another Council be&s;ides the&s;e two, compo&s;ed of Sixty, con&s;i&s;ting of tho&s;e of the Two hundred that have borne Offices, &s;uch as Auditors, Attorney-Generals, or tho&s;e that have been in other Employments, which are given for a determinate number of Years: This Court has
<PB N="9" REF="7"> no Authority, but is called together by the Twenty five, when any extraordinary occa&s;ion makes it advi|&s;able for them to call for a more general Concurrence in the Re&s;olutions that they are about to form. And this Council is of the nature of a Council of State that only gives Advice, but has no power in it &s;elf to enforce its Advices. The whole Body of the Burge&s;&s;es chu&s;es the Sindicks the fir&s;t Sunday in the Year, and there are &s;ome other Elections that do likewi&s;e belong to them. The difference between the Burge&s;&s;es and Ci|tizens is, that the former degree may be bought or gi|ven to Strangers, and they are capable to be of the Two hundred: but none is a Citizen but he that is the Son of a Burge&s;s, and that is born within the Town.</P>
<P>I need &s;ay no more of the Con&s;titution of this little Republick: Its chief &s;upport is in the firm Alliance that has &s;tood now &s;o long between it and the <HI>Cantons</HI> of <HI>Bern</HI> and <HI>Zurich;</HI> and it is &s;o vi&s;ibly the Intere&s;t of all <HI>Switzerland</HI> to pre&s;erve it as the Key, by which it may be all laid open: that if the <HI>Cantons</HI> had not for|gotten their Intere&s;t &s;o palpably in &s;uffering the <HI>French</HI> to become Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Franche Comt&egrave;,</HI> one would think that they would not be capable of &s;uffering <HI>Ge|neva</HI> to be touch'd: for all that can be done in fortify|ing the Town, can &s;ignifie no more, but to put it in ca&s;e to re&s;i&s;t a Surpri&s;e or Scalade; &s;ince if a Royal Ar|my comes again&s;t it to be&s;iege it in form, it is certain, that unle&s;s the <HI>Switzers</HI> come down with a Force able to rai&s;e the Siege, tho&s;e within will be able to make a very &s;hort re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>From <HI>Geneva</HI> I went throngh the Country of <HI>Vaud</HI> or the <HI>Valley,</HI> and <HI>Lau&s;anne,</HI> its chief Town, in my way to <HI>Bern.</HI> The Town of <HI>Lau&s;anne</HI> is &s;ituated on three Hills, &s;o that the whole Town is a&s;cent and de&s;cent, and that very &s;teep, chiefly on the &s;ide on which the Church &s;tands, which is a very noble Fabrick. The South-wall of the Cro&s;s was &s;o &s;plit by an Earthquake about thirty years ago, that there was a rent made from
<PB N="10" REF="8"> top to bottom above a foot wide; which was &s;o clo&s;ed up ten years after by another Earthquake, that now one only &s;ees where the breach was. This extrava|gant &s;ituation of the Town was occa&s;ioned by a Legend of &s;ome Miracles wrought near the Church: which prevailed &s;o much on the Credulity of that Age, that by it the Church, and &s;o in con&s;equence the Buildings near it, were added to the old Town, which &s;tood on the other Hill, where there was a Town made on the High-way from the Lake into <HI>Switzerland,</HI> to which the chief Priviledges of the Town, particularly the ju|dicature of Life and Death, do &s;till belong. Between <HI>Geneva</HI> and this, lies the Lake which at the one end is called the Lake of <HI>Geneva,</HI> and at the other the Lake of <HI>Lau&s;anne.</HI> I need not mention the Dimen&s;ions of it which are &s;o well known, only in &s;ome Places the depth has never been found, for it is more than five hundred Fathom: The banks of the Lake are the beau|tifulle&s;t Plots of Ground that can be imagined, for they look as if they had been laid by art: the &s;loping is &s;o ea&s;ie and &s;o equal, and the Grounds are &s;o well culti|vated and peopled, that a more delighting Pro&s;pect cannot be &s;een any where: The Lake is well &s;tock'd with excellent Fi&s;h; but their Numbers do &s;en&s;ibly decrea&s;e, and one &s;ort is quite lo&s;t: it is not only to be a&s;cribed to the ravenou&s;ne&s;s of the Pikes that abound in it, but to another &s;ort of Fi&s;h that they call <HI>Moutails,</HI> which were never taken in the Lake untill within &s;ix years la&s;t pa&s;t: they are in the Lake of <HI>Neuf-cha&s;tel,</HI> and &s;ome of the other Lakes of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> and it is likely that by &s;ome conveyance under ground they may have come into Channels that fall into the Lake: the Water of the Lake is all clear and fre&s;h. It is not only a great Pond made by the <HI>Rho&s;ne</HI> that runs into it, but does not pa&s;s through it unmix'd, as &s;ome Travellers have fondly imagined, becau&s;e &s;ometimes a &s;oft Gale makes a curling of the Waters in &s;ome places, which runs &s;mooth in the places over which that &s;oft breath

<P>One Hill not far from <HI>Geneva,</HI> called <HI>Maudit,</HI> or Cur|&s;ed, of which one Third is always covered with Snow, is two miles of perpendicular height, according to the Ob&s;ervation of that incomparable Mathematician and Philo&s;opher, <HI>Nicolas Fatio Duilier,</HI> who at Twenty two Years of Age is already one of the greate&s;t men of his Age, and &s;eems to be born to carry Learning &s;ome &s;izes beyond what it has yet attain'd.</P>
<P>But now I will entertain you a little with the State of <HI>Bern,</HI> for that Canton alone is above a third part of all <HI>Switzerland.</HI> I will &s;ay nothing of its Beginnings nor Hi&s;tory: nor will I enlarge upon the Con&s;titutions which are all well known. It has a Coun&s;el of Two hundred, that goes by that Name, tho' it con&s;i&s;ts al|mo&s;t of Three hundred; and another of Twenty five, as <HI>Geneva.</HI> The chief Magi&s;trates are two <HI>Advoyers,</HI> who are not annual, as the Sindicks of <HI>Geneva,</HI> but are for life, and have an Authority not unlike that of the
<PB N="12" REF="9"> <HI>Roman</HI> Con&s;uls; each being his Year by turns the <HI>Ad|voyer</HI> in Office. After them there are the four <HI>Ban|nerets,</HI> who an&s;wer to the Tribunes of the People in <HI>Rome:</HI> then come the two <HI>Bur&s;ars</HI> or Trea&s;urers, one for the ancient <HI>German</HI> Territory, the other for the <HI>French</HI> Territory or the Country of <HI>Vaud,</HI> and the two la&s;t, cho&s;en of the Twenty five, are called the Secrets; for to them all Secrets relating to the State are di&s;co|vered: and they have an Authority of calling the Two hundred together when they think fit, and of accu&s;ing tho&s;e of the Magi&s;tracy, the <HI>Advoyers</HI> them&s;elves not excepted, as they &s;ee cau&s;e; tho' this falls out &s;eldom.</P>
<P>There are &s;eventy two Bailiages, into which the whole Canton of <HI>Bern</HI> is divided, and in every one of tho&s;e there is a Bailiff named by the Council of Two hundred, who mu&s;t be a Citizen of <HI>Bern,</HI> and one of the Two hundred, to which Council no man can be cho&s;en till he is married. The&s;e Bailiages are Imploy|ments both of Honour and Profit; for the Bailiff is the Governour and Judge in that Juri&s;diction: &s;ince tho' he has &s;ome A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors who are cho&s;en out of the Baili|age, yet he may by his Authority carry matters which way he will, again&s;t all their Opinions: and the Bai|liffs have all the Confi&s;cations and Fines; &s;o that Drinking being &s;o common in the Country, and that producing many Quarrels, the Bailiff makes his advan|tage of all tho&s;e di&s;orders: and in the &s;ix years of his Government according to the quality of his Bailiage, he not only lives by it, but will carry perhaps twenty thou&s;and Crowns with him back to <HI>Bern;</HI> on which he lives till he can carry another Bailiage; for one is ca|pable of being twice Bailiff: but tho' &s;ome have been thrice Bailiffs, this is very extraordinary. The Ex|actions of the Bailiff are the only Impo&s;itions or Char|ges to which the Inhabitants are &s;ubjected; and the&s;e falling only on the Irregularities and Di&s;orders of the more debauched, makes that this Grievance, tho' in &s;ome particulas Ca&s;es it pre&s;&s;es hard, yet is not &s;o uni|ver&s;ally
<PB N="13" REF="9"> felt: for a &s;ober and regular man is in no dan|ger. Many in this Canton are as in <HI>England,</HI> Lords of Ca&s;tles and Mannors, and have a Juri&s;diction an|nexed to their E&s;tates, and name their Magi&s;trate, who is called the <HI>Ca&s;tellan,</HI> In matters of &s;mall con&s;e|quence there lies no Appeal from him to the Bailiff; but beyond the value of two Pi&s;tols an Appeal lies; and no Sentence of Death is executed till it is con|firmed at <HI>Bern.</HI> There lies al&s;o an Appeal from the Bailiff to the Council at <HI>Bern.</HI> There are many Com|plaints of the inju&s;tice of the Bailiffs; but their Law is &s;hort and clear, &s;o that a Sute is &s;oon ended: two or three Hearings is the mo&s;t that even an intricate Sute amounts to, either in the fir&s;t In&s;tance before the Bai|liff, or in the &s;econd Judgment at <HI>Bern.</HI> The Citizens of <HI>Bern</HI> con&s;ider the&s;e Bailiages as their Inheritance, and they are courted in this State, perhaps, with as much Intrigue as was ever u&s;ed among the <HI>Romans</HI> in the di&s;tribution of their Provinces: and &s;o little &s;ig|nifie the be&s;t Regulations when there are intrin&s;ick Di&s;ea&s;es in a State, that though there is all po&s;&s;ible Precaution u&s;ed in the Nomination of the&s;e Bailiffs, yet that has not pre&s;erved this State from falling under &s;o great a mi&s;chief by tho&s;e little Provinces; that as it has already in a great mea&s;ure corrupted their Mo|rals, &s;o it may, likely, turn in Conclu&s;ion to the Ruine of this Republick. All the Electors give their Voices by Ballot; &s;o that they are free from all after-Game in the Nomination of the Per&s;on; All the Kin|dred of the Pretenders, even to the remote&s;t degrees, are excluded from Voting, as are al&s;o all their Credi|tors; &s;o that none can vote, but tho&s;e who &s;eem to have no intere&s;t in the I&s;&s;ue of the Competition: and yet there is &s;o much Intrigue, and &s;o great Corruption in the di&s;tribution of the&s;e Imployments, That the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s, in which all <HI>Bern</HI> is ever in motion, is the catching of the be&s;t Bailiages, on which a Family will have its Eye for many Years before they fall. For
<PB N="14" REF="10"> the Coun&s;ellors of <HI>Bern</HI> give a very &s;mall &s;hare of their E&s;tates to their Children when they marry them: all that they purpo&s;e is, to make a Bailiage &s;ure to them: for this they fea&s;t and drink, and &s;pare nothing by which they may make &s;ure a &s;ufficient number of Votes: but it is the Chamber of the <HI>Bannerets</HI> that admits the Pretenders to the Competition. When the Bailiff is cho&s;en, he takes all po&s;&s;ible methods to make the be&s;t of it he can, and lets few Crimes pa&s;s that carry either Confi&s;cations or Fines after them: his Ju&s;tice al&s;o is generally &s;u&s;pected. It is true, tho&s;e of the Bailiage may complain to the Council at <HI>Bern,</HI> as the oppre&s;&s;ed Provinces did anciently to the Senate of <HI>Rome:</HI> and there have been &s;evere Judgments again&s;t &s;ome more exorbitant Bailiffs; yet as Com|plaints are not made, except upon great Occa&s;ions, which are not often given by the Bailiffs, &s;o it being the general Intere&s;t of the Citizens of <HI>Bern</HI> to make all po&s;&s;ible Advantages of tho&s;e Imployments, the Cen|&s;ure will be but gentle, except the Complaint is crying.</P>
<P>In <HI>Bern</HI> there is very little Trade, only what is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of the Towns They maintain Profe&s;&s;ors in the Univer&s;ities of <HI>Bern</HI> and <HI>Lau&s;anne,</HI> the one for the <HI>German</HI> Territory, which is the anci|ent Canton, and the other for the new Conque&s;t, which is the <HI>French.</HI> In the former there are about three hundred Pari&s;hes, in the other there are but about a hundred and fifty: but in the Benefices of the <HI>German</HI> &s;ide, the ancient Rights of the Incumbents are generally pre&s;erved, &s;o that &s;ome Benefices are worth a thou&s;and Crowns; whereas in the <HI>Pais des Vaud</HI> the Provi&s;ions are generally from a hundred to two hundred Crowns. It is vi&s;ible that tho&s;e of <HI>Bern</HI> tru&s;t more to the Affections and Fidelity of their Subjects, than to the &s;trength of their Walls: for as they have never fini&s;hed them, &s;o what is built cannot be brought to a regular Fortification; and it is not
<PB N="15" REF="10"> pre&s;erved with any care, nor furni&s;hed with Canon; but if they have none on their Ramparts, they have good &s;tore in their Ar&s;enal, in which they &s;ay there are Arms for forty thou&s;and men.</P>
<P>The Pea&s;ants are generally rich, chiefly in the <HI>Ger|man</HI> &s;ide, and are all well armed: they pay no Duties to the Publick; and the Soil is capable of great Culti|vation, in which &s;ome &s;ucceed &s;o well, that I was &s;hewed &s;ome that were by accident at <HI>Bern,</HI> who, as I was told, had of E&s;tate to the value of a hundred thou&s;and Crowns, but that is not ordinary; yet ten thou&s;and Crowns for a Pea&s;ant is no extraordinary matter. They live much on their Milk and Corn, which in &s;ome Places, as about <HI>Payern,</HI> yields an in|crea&s;e of fifteen mea&s;ures after one: they breed many Hor&s;es, which bring them in a great deal of money. The wor&s;t thing in the Country is the moi&s;ture of the Air, which is not only occa&s;ioned by the many Lakes that are in it, and the Neighbouring Mountains that are covered with Snow, &s;ome all the Summer long, and the re&s;t till Mid-&s;ummer; but by the va&s;t quantity of Woods of Fir-trees, which &s;eem to fill very near the half of their Soil; and if the&s;e were for the mo&s;t part rooted out, as they would have much more Soil, &s;o their Air would be much purer; yet till they find either Coal or Turf for their Fewel this cannot be done. I was told that they had found Coal in &s;ome Places. If the Coal is conveniently &s;ituated, &s;o that by their Lakes and Rivers it can be ea&s;ily carried over the Country, it may &s;ave them a great extent of ground, that as it is covered with Wood, &s;o the Air becomes thereby the more unwhol&s;ome.</P>
<P>They have &s;ome Fountains of Salt-water; but the making Salt con&s;umes &s;o much Wood, that hitherto it has not turn'd to any Account.</P>
<P>The Men are generally &s;incere, but heavy: they think it nece&s;&s;ary to correct the moi&s;ture of the Air with liberal Entertainments, and they are well fur|ni&s;hed
<PB N="16" REF="11"> with all nece&s;&s;ary Ingredients: for as their Soil produces good Cattel, &s;o their Lakes abound in Fi&s;h, and their Woods in Fowl, the Wine is al&s;o light and good. The Women are generally employed in their dome&s;tick Affairs, and the Wives even of the chief Magi&s;trates of <HI>Bern</HI> look into all the Concerns of the Hou&s;e and Kitchin as much as the Wives of the mean|e&s;t Pea&s;ants. Men and Women do not conver&s;e pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly together; and the Women are &s;o much amu&s;ed with the Management at home, and enter &s;o little into Intrigues, that among them, as an eminent Phy&s;ician there told me, they know not what Vapours are, which he imputed to the Idlene&s;s and Intrigues that abound el&s;ewhere, whereas he &s;aid, among them the Blood was clean&s;ed by their Labour, and as that made them &s;leep well, &s;o they did not amu&s;e them|&s;elves with much thinking, nor did they know what Amours were. The third Adultery is puni&s;hed with Death, which is al&s;o the puni&s;hment of the fifth Act of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ornication; of which I &s;aw an in&s;tance while I was at <HI>Bern:</HI> for, a Woman who confe&s;&s;ed her &s;elf guilty of many Whoredoms, and de&s;igned to be revenged on &s;ome Men that did not furni&s;h her liberally with Mo|ney, was upon that condemned and executed: the manner was &s;olemn; for the <HI>Advoyer</HI> comes into an open Bench in the middle of the Street, and for the Satisfaction of the People, the whole Proce&s;s was read, and Sentence was pronounced in the hear|ing of all; the Coun&s;ellors both of the great and le&s;&s;er Council &s;tanding about the <HI>Advoyer,</HI> who after Sentence took the Criminal very gently by the hand, and pray'd for her Soul: and after Execu|tion, there was a Sermon for the In&s;truction of the People.</P>
<P>The whole State is di&s;po&s;ed for War, for every man that can bear Arms is li&s;ted, and knows his Po&s;t and Arms; and there are Beacons &s;o laid over the Country, that the Signal can run over the whole Can|ton
<PB N="17" REF="11"> in a night: and their Military Li&s;ts are &s;o laid, that every man knows whither he is to come out upon fir&s;t or &s;econd, or not till the general Summons. They a&s;&s;ured me at <HI>Bern,</HI> That upon a general Summons they could bring above eighty thou&s;and Men together. The Men are robu&s;t and &s;trong, and capable of great Hard&s;hip, and of good Di&s;cipline, and have generally an extream &s;en&s;e of Liberty, and a great Love to their Country; but they labour under a want of Officers. And tho' the Subjects of the State are rich, yet the Publick is poor: they can well re&s;i&s;t a &s;udden Inva&s;ion of their Country, but they would &s;oon grow weary of a long War: and the Soil requires &s;o much Cultiva|tion, that they could not &s;pare from their Labour the Men that would be nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve their Country. They were indeed as happy as a People could be, when the Emperour had <HI>Al&s;ace</HI> on the one hand, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had the <HI>Franche Comt&eacute;</HI> on the other; they had no rea&s;on to fear their Neighbours: but now that both tho&s;e Provinces are in the hands of the <HI>French,</HI> the ca&s;e is quite altered; for as <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> is every moment in danger from the Garri&s;on of <HI>Hunningen,</HI> that is but a Canon &s;hot di&s;tant from it, &s;o all the <HI>Pais de Vaud</HI> lies open to the <HI>Franche Comt&eacute;,</HI> and has neither fortified Places, nor good Pa&s;&s;es to &s;ecure it; &s;o that their Error in &s;uffering this to fall into the hands of the <HI>French</HI> was &s;o gro&s;s, that I took &s;ome pains to be in|formed concerning it, and will here give you this Ac|count that I had from one who was then in a very emi|nent Po&s;t; &s;o that as he certainly knew the Secret, he &s;eemed to &s;peak &s;incerely to me. He told me that the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> had often moved in the Councils of War, That the Inva&s;ion of <HI>France</HI> ought to be made on that &s;ide in which <HI>France</HI> lay open, and was very ill fortified: This he repeated often, and it was known in <HI>France:</HI> &s;o that the King re&s;olved to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the <HI>Comt&ecirc;,</HI> but u&s;ed that Precaution, that fearing to provoke the <HI>Swit&s;ers,</HI> he offred a Neutrality on that
<PB N="18" REF="12"> &s;ide: but the <HI>Spaniards</HI> who judged right, that it was as much the intere&s;t of the Cantons, as it was theirs, to pre&s;erve the <HI>Comt&egrave;</HI> in their hands, refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to it; but they took no care to defend it, and &s;eemed to leave that to the <HI>Swit&s;ers.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while the <HI>French</HI> Money went about very liberally at <HI>Bern,</HI> and after tho&s;e that were mo&s;t likely to make oppo&s;ition were gained, the <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ter propo&s;ed to them the nece&s;ity in which his Ma&s;ter found him&s;elf engaged to &s;ecure him&s;elf on that &s;ide; but that &s;till he would grant a <HI>Neutrallity</HI> on their account, if the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would agree to it; and with this, all the a&s;&s;urances that could be given in words were offered to them, that they &s;hould never find the lea&s;t prejudice from the Neighbourhood of the <HI>French,</HI> but on the contrary all po&s;&s;ible Protection; There was ju&s;t cau&s;e given by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to con&s;ider them very little in their Deliberation: for they would neither accept of the <HI>Neutrality,</HI> nor &s;end a con&s;ider|able force Force to pre&s;erve the <HI>Comte,</HI> &s;o that it &s;eem'd almo&s;t inevitable to give way to the <HI>French</HI> propo|&s;ition; but one propo&s;ed that, which an anbya&s;&s;ed A&s;&s;embly would certainly have accepted, that they &s;hould go them&s;elves and take the <HI>Comte,</HI> and by &s;o doing they would &s;ecure the <HI>Neutrality,</HI> which was all that the <HI>French</HI> pretended to de&s;ire, and they might ea&s;ily &s;atisfie the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and reimbur&s;e them&s;elves of the Expence of the <HI>Inva&s;ion,</HI> by re&s;toring the <HI>Comt&egrave;</HI> to them when a General Peace &s;hould be made. He laid out the mi&s;ery to which their Country mu&s;t be reduced by &s;o powerful a Neighbour, but all was lo&s;t labour, &s;o he went out in a rage and publi&s;hed through the Town, that the State was Sold and all was lo&s;t. They now &s;ee their Error too late, and would repair <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t, if it were po&s;&s;ible, but the truth is, many of the particular Members of this State, do &s;o prey upon the publick, that unle&s;s they do with one con&s;ent reform tho&s;e abu&s;es, they will never be in condition to do
<PB N="19" REF="12"> much: for in many of their Bailiages, of which &s;ome are Abbeys, the Bailiffs not only feed on the Subjects, but likewi&s;e on the State, and pretend they are &s;o far &s;uper-expended, that they di&s;count a great deal of the publick revenue, of which they are the receivers, for their reimbur&s;ement: which made Mr. <HI>d' Erlack,</HI> once &s;ay, when one of tho&s;e accounts was pre&s;ented, that it was very &s;trange if the Abbey could not feed the Monks. It is true, the power of their <HI>Bannerets</HI> is &s;o great, that one would think they might redre&s;s many Abu&s;es. The City of <HI>Bern</HI> is divided into four Bodies not unlike our Comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nies of <HI>London,</HI> which are the Bakers, the Butchers, the Tanners, and the Black|&s;miths, and every Citizen of <HI>Bern</HI> does incorporate him&s;elf into one of the&s;e Societies, which they call <HI>Abbeys.</HI> For it is likely they were antiently a &s;ort of a <HI>Religious Fraternity:</HI> every one of the&s;e chu&s;es two <HI>Bannerets,</HI> who bear Office by turns, from <HI>Four Years</HI> to <HI>Four Years,</HI> and every one of them has a <HI>Bailiage</HI> annexed to his Office, which he holds for Life. They carry their Names from the <HI>Banners</HI> of the &s;everal <HI>Ab|beys</HI> as the <HI>Gonfaloniers</HI> of <HI>Italy:</HI> and the <HI>Advoyers</HI> carry &s;till their Name from the ancient Titles <HI>Ecdicus</HI> or Ad|vocate, that was the Title of the chief Magi&s;trates of the Towns in the Times of the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperours. The Chamber of the four <HI>Bannerets</HI> that bear Office, has a va&s;t power, they examine and pa&s;s all Accounts, and they admit all the competitors to any Offices, &s;o that no man can be propo&s;ed to the Council of <HI>Two Hundred</HI> without their Approbation, and this being now the chief Intrigue of their State, they have &s;o ab&s;olute an Authority in &s;hutting men out from Em|ployments, that their office, which is for life, is no le&s;s con&s;iderable than that of the <HI>Advoyer,</HI> tho' they are inferiour to him in Rank.

<P>He had a Misfortune in a War that was thirty years ago, in the Year 1656, between the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> and the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Cantons, the Occa&s;ion of which will engage <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> in a &s;hort Digre&s;&s;ion.

<P>The two famous Orders that had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves of the e&s;teem of tho&s;e dark Ages were engaged in a mighty Rivalry. The <HI>Dominicans</HI> were the more learned, They were the eminente&s;t Preachers of tho&s;e Times, and had the Conduct of the Courts of In|qui&s;ition, and the other chief Offices in the Church in their hands. But on the other hand, the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> had an outward Appearance of more Severity, a ruder Habit, &s;tricter Rules, and greater Poverty: all which gave them &s;uch advantages in the eyes of the &s;imple multitude, as were able to ballance the other Honours of the <HI>Dominican</HI> Order. In &s;hort, The two Orders were engaged in a high Rivalry; but the Devotion towards the Virgin being the prevailing Pa&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e Times, the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> upon this had great Ap|vantages. The <HI>Dominicans,</HI> that are all engaged in the Defence of <HI>Thomas Aquinas</HI>'s Opinions, were thereby obliged to a&s;&s;ert that &s;he was born in Original Sin: this was propo&s;ed to the People by the <HI>Franci&s;cans</HI> as no le&s;s than Bla&s;phemy; and by this the <HI>Dominicans</HI> began to lo&s;e ground extreamly in the minds of the People, who were &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favours of the im|maculate Conception.</P>

In two of the&s;e Apparitions, that were both managed in the &s;ame manner. the Friar in the Mask talked much of the <HI>Dominican</HI> Order which he &s;aid was exce&s;&s;ively dear to the B.

When the injoyned Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">cipline was fully performed, the Spirit appeared again, and &s;aid, He was now delivered out of <HI>Purgatory;</HI> but be|fore he could be admitted to Heaven he mu&s;t receive the Sacrament, having died without it, and after that he would &s;ay Ma&s;s for tho e who had by their great Charities re&s;cued him out of his pains. The Friar fancied the Voice re&s;embled the Priors a little: but he was then &s;o far from &s;u&s;pecting any thing, that he gave no great heed to this &s;u&s;picion. Some days af|ter
<PB N="28" REF="17"> this, the &s;ame Friar appeared as a Nun all in glory, and told the poor Friar that &s;he was St. <HI>Barbara,</HI> for whom he had a particular Devotion, and added, that the B.

After &s;ome days the longed for delu&s;ion appeared to him, cloath|ed as the Virgin u&s;ed to be on the great Fea&s;ts, and in|deed in the &s;ame Habits: there were about her &s;ome Angels, which he afterwards found were the little &s;ta|tues of An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">els which they &s;et on the Altars on the great Holidays. There was al&s;o a pulley fa&s;tned in the Room over his head, and a Cord tied to the Angels, that made them ri&s;e up in the Air, and flie about the Virgin, which increa&s;ed the Delu&s;ion. The Virgin, after &s;ome endearments to him&s;elf, extolling the me|rit of his Charity and Di&s;cipline, told him, That &s;he was conceived in original &s;in, and that Pope <HI>Julius</HI> the Second, that then reigned, was to put an end to the Di&s;pute, and was to aboli&s;h the Fea&s;t of her Concep|tion, which <HI>Sixtus</HI> the Fourth had in&s;tituted, and that the Friar was to be the In&s;trument of per&s;wading the Pope of the truth in that matter. She gave him three drops of her Sons Blood, which were th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ee tears of Blood that he had &s;hed over <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> and this &s;ignified that &s;he was three hours in original Sin, after which &s;he was, by his mercy, delivered out of that State: for it &s;eems the <HI>Dominicans</HI> were re&s;olved &s;o to compound the matter, that they &s;hould gain the main Point of her Conception in Sin, yet they would com|ply &s;o far with the Reverence for the Virgin, with which the World was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that &s;he &s;hould be be|lieved to have remained a very &s;hort while in that State. She gave him al&s;o five drops of Blood in the
<PB N="29" REF="17"> form of a Cro&s;s, which were Tears of Blood that &s;he had &s;hed while her Son was on the Cro&s;s. And, to convince him more fully, &s;he pre&s;ented an Ho&s;ty to him, that appeared as an ordinary Ho&s;ty, and of a &s;udden it appeared to be of a deep red colour. The Cheat of tho&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed Vi&s;its was often repeated to the abu&s;ed Friar; at la&s;t the Virgin told him that &s;he was to give him &s;uch marks of her Son's Love to him, that the matter &s;hould be pa&s;t all doubt. She &s;aid, That the five Wounds of St. <HI>Lucia</HI> and St. <HI>Catharine</HI> were real Wounds, and that &s;he would al&s;o imprint them on him, &s;o &s;he bid him reach his hand: he had no great mind to receive a Favour in which he was to &s;uffer &s;o much: but &s;he forced his hand and &s;truck a Nail through it; the Hole was as big as a Grain of Pea&s;e, and he &s;aw the Candle clearly through it: this threw him out of a &s;uppo&s;ed Tran&s;port into a real Agony: but &s;he &s;eemed to touch his Hand, and he thought he &s;melt an Oyntment with which &s;he anoint|ed it, tho' his Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">fe&s;&s;or per&s;waded him that that was only an Imagination: &s;o the &s;uppo&s;ed Virgin left him for that time.</P>
<P>The next Night the Apparition returned, and brought &s;ome linnen Cloaths, which had &s;ome real or imaginary vertue to allay his torment: and the pretended Virgin &s;aid, they were &s;ome of the linings in which <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> was wrapped, and with that &s;he gave him a &s;oporiferous draught, and while he was fa&s;t a&s;leep, the other four Wounds were imprinted on his body in &s;uch a manner that he felt no pain.</P>
<P>But in order to the doing of this, the Friars be took them&s;elves to Charms, and the Subprior &s;hewed the re&s;t a Book full of them: but he &s;aid that before they could be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ffectual they mu&s;t renounce God: and he not only did this him&s;elf, but by a formal Act put in Writ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ng, &s;igned with his Blood, he dedicated him&s;elf to the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">vil: it is true he did not oblige the re&s;t to this, but only to renounce God.

<P>It was in vain to delude him with more Appariti|ons, for he well nigh kill'd a Frier that came to him per&s;onating the Virgin in another &s;hape, with a Crown on her Head.

<P>The Friers fearing that an Impo&s;ture, which was carried on hitherto with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, &s;hould be quite &s;poiled, and be turned again&s;t them, thought the &s;ure&s;t way was to own the whole matter to him, and to engage him to carry on the Cheat.

<P><HI>Switzerland</HI> lies between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> that are both of them Countries incomparably more rich, and better furni&s;hed with all the Plea&s;ures and Conveni|ences of Life than it is; and yet <HI>Italy</HI> is almo&s;t quite di&s;peopled, and the People in it are reduced to a mi|&s;ery, that can &s;carce be imagined by tho&s;e who have not &s;een it: and <HI>France</HI> is in a great mea&s;ure di&s;peo|pled, and the Inhabitants are reduced to a poverty that appears in all the Marks in which it can &s;hew it &s;elf, both in their Hou&s;es, Furniture, Cloaths, and Looks.</P>
<P>On the contrary, <HI>Switzerland</HI> is extream full of peo|ple, and in every place, in the Villages as well as in their Towns, one &s;ees all the Marks he can look for of Plenty and Wealth: Their Hou&s;es and Windows are in good ca&s;e, the High-ways are well maintained, all people are well cloathed, and every one lives at his ea&s;e. This Ob&s;ervation &s;urpri&s;ed me yet more in the Country of the <HI>Gri&s;ons,</HI> who have almo&s;t no Soil at all, being &s;ituated in Valleys that are almo&s;t wa&s;hed away with the Torrents that fall down from the Hills, and &s;well their Brooks &s;ometimes &s;o violently and &s;o &s;ud|denly, that in many places the whole Soil is wa&s;h|ed away, and yet tho&s;e Valleys are well peopled, and every one lives happy and at ea&s;e, under a gentle Government, whil&s;t other rich and plentiful Countries are reduced to &s;uch mi&s;ery, that as many of the Inha|bitants are forced to change their Seats, &s;o tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e who &s;tay behind can &s;carce live and pay tho&s;e grievous Im|po&s;itions that are laid upon them.

In the chief Church of <HI>Soloturn</HI> there is an Image of God the Fa|ther, as an Old man with a great black beard, having our Saviour on his knees, and a Pigeon over his head. Here al&s;o begins a devotion at the <HI>Ave-Mary-Bell,</HI> which is &s;carce known in <HI>France,</HI> but it is practi&s;ed all <HI>Italy</HI> over: At Noon and at Sun-&s;et the Bell rings, and all &s;ay the <HI>Ave-Mary;</HI> and a &s;hort Prayer to the Virgin; but whereas in <HI>Italy</HI> they content them&s;elves with put|ting off their Hats; in <HI>Switzerland</HI> they do for the mo&s;t part kneel down in the Streets, which I &s;aw no where practi&s;ed in <HI>Italy</HI> except at <HI>Venice,</HI> and there it is not commonly done.

This is indeed chiefly owing to the Canton of <HI>Lucern,</HI> where there is a Spirit in the Government very different from what is in mo&s;t of the other <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Cantons: the re&s;idence of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;adour and of the <HI>Nuntio</HI> in that Town, contri+butes al&s;o much to the pre&s;erving it in &s;o good a tem|per it being their intere&s;t to unite <HI>Switz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rland,</HI> and by this means the heat and indi&s;cretion of the re&s;t i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> often moderated.

<P>I have taken &s;ome pains in my Travels to examine all the Ancient Manu&s;cripts of the New Te&s;tament, concerning that doubted Pa&s;&s;age of St. <HI>John</HI>'s Epi&s;tle, <HI>There are three that bear Witne&s;s in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, and the&s;e three are one. Bul|linger</HI> doubted much of it, becau&s;e he found it not in an ancient <HI>Latin</HI> Manu&s;cript at <HI>Zurich,</HI> which &s;eems to be about eight hundred years old; for it is written in that hand that began to be u&s;ed in <HI>harles</HI> the Great's time. I turned the Manu&s;cript, and found the Pa&s;&s;age was not there: but this was certainly the error or omi&s;&s;ion of the Copier: for before the General Epi&s;tles in that Manu&s;cript, the Preface of St <HI>Jerom</HI>'s is to be found; in which he &s;ays, that he was the more exact in that T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">an&s;lation, that &s;o he might di&s;cover the Fraud of the <HI>Arrians,</HI> who had &s;truck out that Pa&s;&s;age con|cerning
<PB N="42" REF="24"> the Trinity. This Preface is printed in <HI>Lira</HI>'s Bible; but how it came to be left out by <HI>Era&s;mus,</HI> in his Edition of that Father's Works, is that of which I can give no Account: for as on the one hand <HI>Era&s;mus</HI>'s Sincerity ought not to be too ra&s;hly cen&s;ured, &s;o on the other hand, that Preface being in all the Manu|&s;cripts, ancient or modern, of tho&s;e Bibles that have the other Prefaces in them that I ever yet &s;aw, it is not ea&s;ie to imagine what made <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> not to publi&s;h it: and it is in the Manu&s;cript Bibles at <HI>Ba&s;le,</HI> where he printed his Edition of St. <HI>Jerom</HI>'s Works. In the old Manu&s;cript Bible of <HI>Geneva,</HI> that &s;eems to be above &s;even hundred Years old, both the Preface and the Pa&s;&s;age are extant, but with this difference from the common Editions, that the common Editions &s;et the Ver&s;e concerning <HI>the Father, the Word, and the Spirit,</HI> before that of <HI>the Water, the Blood, and the Spirit;</HI> which comes after it in this Copy. And that I may in this place end all the Readings I found of this Pa&s;&s;age in my Travels, there is a Manu&s;cript in St. <HI>Mark's</HI> Li|brary in <HI>Venice</HI> in three Languages, <HI>Greek, Latin,</HI> and <HI>Arabick,</HI> that &s;eems not above four hundred Years old, in which this Pa&s;&s;age is not in the <HI>Greek,</HI> but it is in the <HI>Latin</HI> &s;et after the other three, with a <HI>&s;icut</HI> to joyn it to what goes before. And in a Manu&s;cript <HI>Latin</HI> Bible in the Library of St. <HI>Laurence</HI> at <HI>Florence,</HI> both St. <HI>Jerom</HI>'s Preface and this Pa&s;&s;age are extant: but this Pa&s;&s;age comes after the other, and is pinned to it with a <HI>&s;icut,</HI> as is that of <HI>Venice;</HI> yet <HI>&s;icut</HI> is not in the <HI>Geneva</HI> Manu&s;cript. There are two <HI>Greek</HI> Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;cripts of the Epi&s;tles at <HI>Ba&s;le,</HI> that &s;eem to be about five hun|dred years old, in neither of which this Pa&s;&s;age is to found: they have al&s;o an ancient <HI>Latin</HI> Bible, which is about eight hundred years old; in which tho' St. <HI>Je|rom</HI>'s Prologue is in&s;erted, yet this Pa&s;&s;age is wanting. At <HI>Strasburg</HI> I &s;aw four very ancient Manu&s;cripts of the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> in <HI>Latin:</HI> three of the&s;e &s;eemed to be about the time of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great; but the fourth
<PB N="43" REF="24"> &s;eemed to be much ancienter, and may belong to the &s;eventh Century: in it neither the Prologue nor the Place is extant; but it is added at the foot of the Page with another hand. In two of the other the Prologue is extant, but the Place is not; only in one of them it is added on the Margent. In the fourth, as the Pro|logue is extrant, &s;o is the Place likewi&s;e; but it comes after the Ver&s;e of the other three, and is joyned to it thus, <HI>Sicut tres &s;unt in coelo.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;eem'd &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ange to me, and it is almo&s;t incredible, that in the <HI>Vatican</HI> Library there are no ancient <HI>Latin</HI> Bibles, where above all other places they ought to be lookt for; but I &s;aw none above four hundred years old. There is indeed the famous <HI>Greek</HI> Manu&s;cript of great value, which the Chanoine <HI>Shel&s;trat,</HI> that was Library-Keeper, a&s;&s;erted to be One thou&s;and four hun|dred years old, and proved it by the great &s;imilitude of the Characters with tho&s;e that are upon St. <HI>Hippolite</HI>'s Statue, which is &s;o evident, that if his Statue was made about his time, the Antiquity of this Manu&s;cript is not to be di&s;puted. If the Characters are not &s;o fair, and have not all the marks of Antiquity that appears in the King's Manu&s;cript at St. <HI>James</HI>'s, yet this has been much better pre&s;erved, and is much more entire. The Pa&s;&s;age that has led me into this Digre&s;&s;ion, is not to be found in the <HI>Vatican</HI> Manu&s;cript, no more than it is in the Ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">g's Manu&s;cript.

After two days journey we came to <HI>Coire</HI> which is the chief Town of the <HI>Gri&s;ons,</HI> and where we found a general Diet of the three Leagues &s;itting, &s;o that having &s;taid ten days there, I came to be informed of a great many particulars concerning tho&s;e Leagues, which are not commonly known: The Town is but little, and may contain between four and five thou&s;and Souls; it lies in a bottom upon a &s;mall brook, that a little below the Town falls into the <HI>Rhine.</HI> It is environed with Mountains on all hands, &s;o that they have a very &s;hort Summer, for the Snow is not melted till <HI>May</HI> or <HI>June;</HI> and it began to Snow in <HI>September</HI> when I was there: On a ri&s;ing groun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> at the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-End of the Town is the Cathedral, the

Above a q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">arter of a mile high in the Hill one goes up by a &s;teep a&s;cent to S. <HI>Lucius</HI> Chappel; my Curio&s;ity carryed me thither, tho' I gave no Faith to the Legend of King <HI>Lucius,</HI> and of his coming &s;o far from home to be the Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Gri&s;ons.</HI> His Chappel is a little Vault about ten Foot &s;quare, where ther is an Altar, and where Ma&s;s is &s;aid upon &s;ome great Fe&s;tivites; it is &s;ituated under a natu|ral Arch that is in the Rock, which was thought pro|per to be given out to have been the Cell of a Hermit, from it &s;ome drops of a &s;mall Fountain fall down near the Chappel; the Bi&s;hop a&s;&s;ured me it had a miracu|lovs vertue for weak ey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and that it was Oily: but neither Ta&s;t nor Feeling could di&s;cover to me any Oilyne&s;s: I believe it may be very good for the Eyes, as all Rock-water is; but when I offered to &s;hew the good Old Bi&s;hop that the legend of <HI>Lucius</HI> was a Fable in all the parts of it; but mo&s;t remarkably in that which related to the <HI>Gri&s;ons;</HI> and that we had no Kings in <HI>Brittain</HI> at that time, but were a Province to the <HI>Romans,</HI> that no ancient Au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">hors &s;peak of it, <HI>Bede</HI> being the fir&s;t that mentions it; and that the preten|ded Letter to Pope <HI>Eleutherius,</HI> together with his An|&s;wer, has evident Characters of Forgery in it, all this &s;ignified nothing to the Bi&s;hop, who a&s;&s;ured me that they had a Tradition of that in their Church, and it was in&s;erted in their Breviary which he firmly believ'd. He al&s;o told me the other legend of King <HI>Lucius</HI>'s Si&s;ter S. <HI>Emerita,</HI> who was burnt there, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> of who&s;e Veil there was yet a con&s;iderable remnant re&s;erved among their Relicks; I confe&s;s I never &s;aw a Relick &s;o ill di&s;gui&s;ed, for it is a piece of worn linnen Cloth lately wa&s;ht, and the burning did not &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">em to be a month old; and yet when they took it out of the Ca&s;e to &s;hew it me, there were &s;ome there that with great Devotion
<PB N="51" REF="28"> rub'd their beads upon ir. The Bi&s;hop had &s;ome Con|te&s;ts with his Dean, and being a Prince of the Empire he had pro&s;cribed him: the Dean had al&s;o behaved him&s;elf &s;o in&s;olently, that by an order of the Diet, to which even the Bi&s;hop, as was believed, con&s;ented, he was put in Pri&s;on as he came out of the Cathedral. By the common con&s;ent both of the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Pro|te&s;tant</HI> Communities, a Law was long ago made again&s;t Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Immunities: this attempt on the Dean was made four years ago; as &s;oon as he was let out, he went to <HI>Rome,</HI> and made great Complaints of the Bi&s;hop, and it was thought the <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Party intended to move in the Diet while we were there, for the Re|pealing of that Law, but they did it nor. The foun|dation of the quarrel between the Bi&s;hop and Dean, was the Exemptions to which the Dean and Chapter pretended, and upon which the Bi&s;hop made &s;ome inva&s;ion. Upon which I took occa&s;ion to &s;hew him the novelty of tho&s;e Exemptions, and that in the Pri|mitive Church it was believed that the Bi&s;hop had the Authority over his Presbyters by a Divine Right; and if it was by a Divine Right, then the Pope could not exempt them from his Obedience: but the Bi&s;hop would not carry the matter &s;o high, and contented him&s;elf with two maxims; the one was, <HI>That the Bi&s;hop was</HI> Chri&s;t's <HI>Vicar in his Dioce&s;s:</HI> and the other was, <HI>That what the Pope was in the Catholick-Church, the Bi&s;hop was the &s;ame in his Dioce&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>He was a good natured man, and did not make u&s;e of the great Authority that he has over the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> there, to &s;et them on to live unea&s;ily wth their Neigh|bours of another Religion. That Bi&s;hop was anti|ently a great Prince, and the greate&s;t part of the League that carries &s;till the Name of <HI>The Hou&s;e of God,</HI> belonged to him, tho' I was a&s;&s;ured that <HI>Pregallia,</HI> one of the&s;e Communities was a Free-State above Six hundred years ago, and that they have Records yet extant that prove this: The other Communities to
<PB N="52" REF="29"> this League bought their Liberties from &s;everal Bi&s;hops &s;ome con&s;iderable time before the Reformation, of which the Deeds are yet extant: So that it is an im|pudent thing to &s;ay, as &s;ome have done, That they &s;hook off his Yoke at that time.</P>
<P>The Bi&s;hop hath yet re&s;erved a Revenue of about One thou&s;and pound &s;terling a year, and every one of the Prebendaries hath near Two hundred pound a year. It is not ea&s;ie to imagine out of what the Riches of this Countrey is rai&s;ed, for one &s;ees nothing but a tract of va&s;t Mountains that &s;eem barren Rocks, and &s;ome little Vallies among them not a mile broad, and the be&s;t part of the&s;e is wa&s;hed away by the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and &s;ome Brooks that fall into it: but their we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">lth con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in their Hills, which afford much Pa&s;ture, and in the hot Months, in which all the Pa&s;ture of <HI>Italy</HI> is generally parched, the Cattle are driven into the&s;e Hills, which brings them in a Re|venue of above Two hundred thou&s;and Crowns a year. The Publick is indeed very poor, but particu|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">r per&s;ons are &s;o rich, that I knew a great many there, who were believed to have E&s;tates to the value of One hundred thou&s;and Crowns, Mr. <HI>Schove&s;tein</HI> that is accounted the riche&s;t man in the Country, is believed to be worth a million, I mean of Livres. The Government here is purely a Common-wealth, for in the Choice of their Magi&s;trates every man that is above &s;ixteen years Old hath his voice, which is al&s;o the Con&s;titution of &s;ome of the &s;mall Cantons. The three Leagues are, the League of the <HI>Gri&s;ons,</HI> that of the <HI>Hou&s;e of God,</HI> and that of <HI>The Ten Ju|ri&s;dictions.</HI></P>
<P>They believe that upon the incur&s;ions of the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals,</HI> as &s;ome fled to the <HI>Venetian</HI> I&s;lands, out of which aro&s;e that famous Common-Wealth; &s;o others came and &s;heltred them&s;elves in tho&s;e Valleys. They told me of an ancient In&s;cription lately found, of a Stone where on the one &s;ide is graven <HI>Omitto
<PB N="53" REF="29"> Rhetos Indomitos,</HI> and <HI>ne plus &V;ltra</HI> is on the other; which they pretend was made by <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar;</HI> the Stone on which this In&s;cription is is upon one of their Mountains, but I did not pa&s;s that way, &s;o I can make no judgment concerning it. After the fir&s;t for|ming of this People, they were ca&s;t into little States, according to the different Valleys which they inhabi|ted, and in which Ju&s;tice was admini&s;tred, and &s;o they fell under the power of &s;ome little Princes that became &s;evere Ma&s;ters; but when they &s;aw the Ex|ample that the <HI>Switzers</HI> had &s;et them, in &s;haking off the <HI>Au&s;trinn</HI> Yoke above two hundred years ago, they likewi&s;e combin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d to &s;hake off theirs; only &s;ome few of tho&s;e &s;mall Princes u&s;ed their Authority better, and concurred with the People in &s;haking off the yoke, and &s;o they are &s;till parts of the body; only <HI>Halden|&s;tein</HI> is an ab&s;olute Soveranity, it is about two miles from <HI>Coire</HI> to the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine;</HI> the whole Territory is about half a mile long at the foot of the <HI>Alps,</HI> where there is &s;carce any breadth. The Authority of the&s;e Barons was formerly more ab&s;olute than it is now, for the Subjects were their Slaves: but to keep together the little Village, they have granted them a power of naming a li&s;t for their Magi&s;trates, the per&s;on being to be named by the Baron; who hath al&s;o the Right of Pardoning, a Right of Coining, and every thing al&s;o that belongs to a Soveraign. I &s;aw th&s;s little Prince in <HI>Coire,</HI> in an Equi|page not &s;uitable to his quality, for he was in all points like a very ordinary Gentleman. There are Three other Baronies that are members of the Diet, and &s;ub|ject to it; the chief belonged to the Arch-Dukes of <HI>In&s;pruck;</HI> the other two belong to <HI>Mr. Schoven&s;tein</HI> and <HI>Mr. de M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nt,</HI> they are the Heads of tho&s;e Communi|ties of which their Baronies are compo&s;ed; they name the Magi&s;trates out of the li&s;ts that are pre&s;en|ted to them by their Subjects; and they have the Right of Pardoning and of Confi&s;cations: That be|longing

One <HI>Travers</HI> bought it of the Emperour in the year 1679. he entred upon the Rights of the ancient Barons, which are &s;pecified in an Agreement that pa&s;t between him and his Pea&s;ants, and was con|firmed by the Emperour. <HI>Travers</HI> made many in|croachments upon the Priviledges of his Subjects, who upon that made their complaints to the league; but <HI>Travers</HI> would have the matter judged at <HI>In&s;pruck,</HI> and the Emperour &s;upported him in this preten&s;ion, and &s;ent an Agent to the Diet: I was pre&s;ent when he had his Audience, in whiah there was nothing but general Complemen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s: But the Diet &s;tood firm to their Con|&s;titution, and a&s;&s;erted that the Emperour had no Au|thority to judge in that matter which belonged only to them, &s;o <HI>Travers</HI> was forced to let his Preten&s;ions fall.</P>
<P>All the other parts of this State are purely Demo|cratical, there are Three different Bodies or Leagues, and every one of the&s;e are an intire Government, and the A&s;&s;embly or Diet of the Three Leagues, is only a Confederacy like the United Provinces or the Cantons: There are Sixty-&s;even Voices in the general Diet, which are thus divided: the league of the <HI>Gri&s;ons</HI> hath twenty-eight Voices, that of the <HI>Hou&s;e of God</HI> hath twenty four, and that of the <HI>Juri&s;dictions</HI> hath fifteen. The <HI>Juri&s;dictions</HI> belonged anciently to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> but they having &s;haken off that Authority, were incorporated into the Diet, but in the la&s;t Wars of <HI>Germany,</HI> the <HI>Au&s;trians</HI> thought to have brought them again under their yoke, yet they defended their Liberty with &s;o much vigour, that the <HI>Au&s;trians</HI> it &s;eems thought the Conque&s;t not worth the while, and that it would not quit the co&s;t. They were affrighted by two extraordinary actions; in one Village which was quite abandoned by all the Men belonging to it, who left the Women in it, &s;ome hundreds, as I was
<PB N="55" REF="30"> told, were quartered, and were apprehen&s;ive of no danger from their Ho&s;te&s;&s;es; but the Women inten|ded to let their Husbands &s;ee that they were capable of contriving and executing a bold de&s;ign; tho' it mu&s;t be confe&s;t it was a little too rough and barbarous for the Sex: They entred into a Combination to cut the Throats of all the Souldiers at one time; the Woman that propo&s;ed this had four lodged with her, and &s;he with her own hands di&s;patcht them all, and &s;o did all the re&s;t, not one Souldier e&s;caping to carry away the News of &s;o unheard of a Rage. In another place a Body of the <HI>Au&s;trians</HI> came into a Valley that was quite abandoned, for the Men that had no Arms but their Clubs and Staves, got up to the Mountains; but they took their mea&s;ures &s;o well, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves &s;o of the Pa&s;&s;es, that they came down upon the Souldiers with &s;o much fury, that they defeated them quite, &s;o that very few e&s;caped, and it is cer|tain that the &s;ubduing them would have proved a very hard work. It is true they are not in a condi|tion to hold out long, the publick is &s;o poor; &s;o that tho' particular per&s;ons are extream rich, yet they have no publick Revenue, but every man is concerned to pre&s;erve his Liberty, which is more intire here than in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> but this often &s;wells too much, and throws them into great convul&s;ion. The league of the <HI>Gri&s;ons</HI> is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t ancient, and it is com|po&s;ed of eight and twenty Communities, of which there are eighteen <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> and the re&s;t are <HI>Prote&s;tants;</HI> the Communities of the two Religions live Neigh|bourly together, yet they do not &s;uffer tho&s;e of ano|ther Religion to live among them, &s;o that every Com|munity is intirely of the &s;ame Religion, and if any one changes he mu&s;t go into another Community. Each Community is an intire State within it &s;elf, and all Per&s;ons mu&s;t meet once a year to chu&s;e the Judge and his A&s;&s;i&s;tants, whom they change or continne from year to year as they &s;ee cau&s;e: There is no difference
<PB N="56" REF="31"> made between Gentleman and Pea&s;ant, and the Te|nant hath a Vote as well as his Landlord, nor dare his Landlord u&s;e him ill when he Votes contrary to his Intentions, for the Pea&s;ants would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ook upon that as a common Quarrel. An Appeal lies from the Judge of the Community to the A&s;&s;embly of the Leag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e, where all matters end; for there lies no Appeal to the gene|ral Diet of the three Leagues, except in matters that concern the conquered Countries, which belong in common to all the three. There is one cho&s;en by the Deputies for the A&s;&s;embly of the League, who is cal|led the head of the League, that can call them toge|ther as he &s;ees cau&s;e, and can likewi&s;e bring a cau&s;e that hath been once judged, to a &s;econd hearing. <HI>Ilants</HI> is the chief Town of this League, where their Diet meets. The &s;econd League is that of the <HI>Hou&s;e of God,</HI> in which there are four and twenty Commu|nities; the Burgoma&s;ter of <HI>Coire</HI> is always the head of this League: This League is almo&s;t wholly <HI>Prote&s;tant,</HI> and the two Valleys of the upper and lower <HI>Engedin</HI> are pointed out by the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> as little le&s;s than <HI>Can|nibals</HI> towards &s;uch <HI>Catholicks</HI> as come among them; but Frier <HI>S&s;ondrato,</HI> Nephew to Pope <HI>Gregory</HI> the four|teenth, who&s;e Mother the Marque&s;s of <HI>Borgomaniero,</HI> that was in <HI>England,</HI> hath married, found the con|trary of all this to be true, to his great regret. About eighteen years ago he was believed to have wrought Miracles, and he became &s;o much in love with the Crown of Martyrdom, that he went through the <HI>Engedm.</HI> not doubting but he would find there that which he de&s;ired. His Brother had come &s;ometime before into the Countrey to drink mineral Waters, and was well known to the Gentry, &s;o &s;ome of the&s;e hearing of the Friers coming, went and waited on him; and he was entertained by them in their Hou&s;es and conveyed him through the Countrey; tho' he took all po&s;&s;ible ways to provoke them, for he was often railing at their Religion, but to all that they
<PB N="57" REF="31"> made no an&s;wer, only they continued their Civilitie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;till, which did &s;o inrage the warm Frier, that he went to <HI>Bormio,</HI> and there (as was believ'd) he died of Grief. An accident fell out five year ago, that the People of the Country e&s;teemed a &s;ort of a Mi|racle. The <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> in their Proce&s;&s;ions go &s;ometimes out of one Community into another, and when they pa&s;s through <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Communities they lower the Cro&s;s, and give over Singing till they are again upon <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> ground; but then they went on bearing up the Cro&s;s, and &s;inging as they went, upon which the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> &s;topt them, and would not &s;uffer them to go on in that manner: they finding that they were not equal in number to the <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> &s;ent to a <HI>Ca|tholick</HI> Community, and de&s;ired them to come to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance: Two thou&s;and came, and by all ap|pearance the di&s;pute would have had a bloody i&s;&s;ue: for the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> were re&s;olved to maintain the Rights of their Community, and the others were no le&s;s re&s;olved to force their way: but an extraordinary thick mi&s;t aro&s;e, and through it the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> fancied they &s;aw a va&s;t body of men, which was no other then a Wood: but terrified with the appearance of &s;uch a Number they retired, and this &s;aved a little Battel that probably would not only have ended in the &s;hedding much Blood, but might have very much di&s;order'd the whole Con&s;titution and union of their Leagnes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> of Quality endeavour much to keep their People in order, but they acknowledged to my &s;elf, that the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> were much peaceabler than the <HI>Catholicks.</HI> The Juri&s;dictions have fifteen Votes in the general Diet, yet they are generally called the ten Juri&s;dictions, and the greater part of them are likewi&s;e of the Religion; for upon the general computation of the three Leagues, the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> are about two thirds. In their Diets there are three Tables, one in the middle and two on either &s;ide, at every Table &s;its
<PB N="58" REF="32"> the head of the League and Secretary near him, and from the Table there goes down Benches on both hands for the Deputies from the communities of that league: They hold their Diets by turns in the chief Towns of the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">veral Leagues, and it hapened to be the turn of the Hou&s;e of God when I was there, &s;o they met at Coire.</P>
<P>The three Leagues have a conquered Country in <HI>Italy</HI> divided into three Di&s;tricts, the <HI>Valteline, Cha|vennes,</HI> and <HI>Bormio.</HI> When <HI>John Galea&s;&s;e</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the Dutchy of <HI>Milan,</HI> and drove out <HI>Barna|bas, Ma&s;tinus</HI> one of <HI>Barnabas</HI>'s Sons, to whom his Fa|ther had given tho&s;e three Branches of the Dutchy of <HI>Milan,</HI> retired to <HI>Coire,</HI> and being ho&s;pitably received and entertained by the Bi&s;hop, when he died he gave his Right to tho&s;e Territories to the Cathedral of <HI>Coire:</HI> but here was a Title without a force able to make it good. But when the Wars of <HI>Italy</HI> were on foot, the three Leagues being much courted by both the Crowns, &s;ince they were Ma&s;ters of the Pa&s;&s;es by which either the <HI>Switzers</HI> or <HI>Germans</HI> could come into <HI>Italy,</HI> they re&s;olved to lay hold on that opportunity; yet they had not zeal enough for their Bi&s;hop to en|gage deep upon his account: &s;o they agreed with him to pay him &s;uch a Revenue, and he transferred his Ti|tle to them; and they were &s;o con&s;iderable to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> that without much ado, they yielded tho&s;e parcels of the Dutchy of <HI>Milan</HI> to them, and by this means they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them. Tho&s;e Acce&s;&s;ions to this State are much better than the principal; for as certainly the <HI>Valteline,</HI> which is above forty miles long and two broad, is one of the riche&s;t Valleys in the World, in which there are three Harve&s;ts &s;ome years, &s;o the <HI>Chavennes</HI> and <HI>Bormio</HI> are much preferable to the be&s;t Valleys of the <HI>Gri&s;ons;</HI> yet the engagement that people have to their native homes appears &s;ignally here, &s;ince the <HI>Gri&s;ons</HI> have not for&s;aken their Coun|try that they might &s;ituate them&s;elves &s;o advantage|ou&s;ly:
<PB N="59" REF="32"> but they love their rugged Valleys, and think the &s;afety they enjoy in them beyond the Plea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ures of their acquired Dominions, &s;o they govern them by Bailiffs and <HI>Pode&s;ta</HI>'s, and other Officers whom they &s;end among them: and all the advantages that they draw from them, is, That the Magi&s;trates whom they &s;end to govern them, do inrich them&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">es, as the Bailiffs in <HI>Switzerland</HI> do.

<P>But to give a more particular relation of that matter, and to tell the Circum&s;tances which &s;eem a little to le&s;|&s;en that Rebellion and Ma&s;&s;acre.

<P>In the year 1618. there was a report &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t about, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had a treaty on foot to tear away the <HI>Valteline</HI> fram the leagues, this was &s;upported by the Fort <HI>Fuentes,</HI> that the Governor of <HI>Milan</HI> was building upon the Lake of <HI>Como,</HI> near the <HI>Valteline.</HI> There was one <HI>Ganatz</HI> a Mini&s;ter, but a bloody and perfidious Man, that &s;et on and managed the rage of the Pea&s;ants, and there was great rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect &s;ome underhand dealing, tho he threw it which way he plea&s;ed. A Chamber of Ju&s;tice was appointed to &s;it at <HI>To&s;&s;ane,</HI> which is a con&s;iderable Town twelve miles from <HI>Coire,</HI> on the way to <HI>Italy,</HI> near <HI>Alta Rhetia,</HI> which is a high and &s;mall Hill, to which there is no acce&s;s but on one &s;ide, where there are yet the ruines of a Ca&s;tle and a Church, and which they believe was the Pallace of <HI>Rhetus</HI> the fir&s;t Prince of the Countrey: There was &s;evere ju|&s;tice done in this Chamber, a Prie&s;t was put to the que&s;tion, and &s;o ill u&s;ed that he died in it, which is a crying thing among them. The chief &s;u&s;picion lay upon one <HI>Pianta,</HI> who being of one of the be&s;t Fa|milies of the <HI>Gri&s;ons,</HI> was then one of the Captains in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Regiment; he withdrew him&s;elf from the &s;torm, but the Pea&s;ants led on by <HI>Ganatz</HI> pur&s;u|ed him &s;o, that at la&s;t they found him and hewed him in pieces, <HI>Ganatz</HI> him&s;elf &s;triking the fir&s;t &s;troke with an Ax, which was taken up and pre&s;erved by his Friends, and four and twenty years after fifty or &s;ixty of his Friends fell upon <HI>Ganatz</HI> in <HI>Coire,</HI> and killed him with the &s;ame Ax, which they brought along with them, that they might execute their de|&s;ign by the &s;ame tool with which their Friend was murthered, <HI>Ganatz</HI> had during the Wars abandoned both his Religion and Profe&s;&s;ion, being, indeed, a di&s;grace to both, and had &s;erved fir&s;t in the <HI>Venetian,</HI> and then in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Troops. After the peace was made he became &s;o con&s;iderable, being &s;uppor|ted

In that Chamber, many that were put to the que&s;tion confe&s;&s;ed enough to hang them, &s;ome indured the que&s;tion and e&s;caped with the lo&s;s of the u&s;e of their Arm. Tho&s;e of the <HI>Val|teline</HI> have made u&s;e of this &s;everity, as that which gave the ri&s;e to the Ma&s;&s;acre, and it is very probable this might have drawn in &s;ome, that would have been otherwi&s;e more moderate, and that it did like|wi&s;e precipitate that barbarous action: yet it was af|terwards found out that the Plot had been formed long before, &s;o that the indu&s;try and rage of the Prie&s;ts managed by <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Emi&s;&s;aries, working upon the bigotry of the people was the real cau&s;e, and this was only made u&s;e of as a pretext to give &s;ome more plau&s;ible colours to the Ma&s;&s;acre, vvhich was executed &s;ome months after this Chamber was di&s;&s;olved.

The
<PB N="65" REF="35"> Duke of <HI>Rohan</HI> &s;eeing that conditions of &s;o much ad|vantage to the Leagues vvere offered to them, did underhand advi&s;e tho&s;e of the Religion to accept of them, at the &s;ame time that he &s;eemed openly to op|po&s;e the treaty &s;et on foot on tho&s;e terms, and that he might get out of this imployment vvith the le&s;s di&s;|honour, he advi&s;ed their clapping him up in pri&s;on till they had fini&s;hed their treaty vvith the <HI>Spaniards.</HI> So that they very gratefully to this day ovvn that they ovve the pre&s;ervation of their Countrey to the vvi&s;e advices of that great Man. Many that vvere of the Religion returned to their Hou&s;es and E&s;tates, but the greate&s;t part fearing &s;uch another Ma&s;&s;acre, have &s;ince changed their Religion, others have &s;old their E&s;tates and left the Country, &s;ome &s;tay &s;till and go tvvo or three hours journey to &s;ome of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> communities, vvhere they have the exer|ci&s;e of the Religion: And tho they may not &s;tay in the <HI>Valteline</HI> above &s;ix weeks at a time, yet they avoid that by going for a day or two out of the Countrey once within that time, nor is that matter at pre&s;ent &s;o &s;everely examined, &s;o that there is a calm among them as to tho&s;e matters. But when it comes to the turn of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> communities to &s;end one of the Religion to tho&s;e imployments, he is often much em|bara&s;&s;ed by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Como,</HI> to who&s;e Dioce&s;s tho&s;e Territories belong, for if the Bi&s;hop fancies that they do any thing contrary to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical immunities, he excommunicates them, and tho this may appear a ridiculous thing, &s;ince they are already in a wor&s;e &s;tate by being Hereticks, yet it produces a very &s;en&s;i|ble effect, for the people that are extreamly &s;uper&s;ti|tious, will not after that come near &s;uch Magi&s;trates, &s;o that about three years ago a Bailiff found him&s;elf obliged to de&s;ire to be recalled, tho his time was not out, &s;ince being excommunicated he could no longer maintain the Government in his own per&s;on,</P>

<P>A Man that hath an E&s;tate by his Wife, enjoys it after her Death as long as he continues a Widovver, but when he marries again he is bound to divide it among the Children that he had by her. The Ju&s;tice is &s;hort and &s;imple; but it is oft thought that Bribes go here, tho' but meanly in proportion to their Po|verty, as well as in other Places. The married Wo|men here do &s;carce appear abroad except at Church, but the young Women have more Liberty before they are married. There is &s;uch a plenty of all things, by rea&s;on of the gentlene&s;s of the Government and the indu&s;try of the People, that in all the ten days in which I &s;tayed at <HI>Coire,</HI> I was but once ask'd an Alms in the Streets. There are two Churches in <HI>Coire,</HI> in the one there is an Organ that joyns with their Voices in the &s;inging of the P&s;alms; and there was for the honour of the Diet, while we were there, an Anthem &s;ung by a &s;et of Mu&s;icians very regularly. In all the Churches both of <HI>Switzerland</HI> and the <HI>Gri|&s;ons,</HI> except in this only, the Mini&s;ter preaches co|vered, but here he is bare-headed. And I ob&s;erved a particular Devotion u&s;ed here in &s;aying of the Lord's Prayer, that the Mini&s;ters who wear Caps put them off when it was &s;aid. The Women here, as in <HI>Bern,</HI> turn all to the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> in time of Prayer, and al&s;o in their private Devotions before and after the pub|lick Prayers: many al&s;o bow at the Name of <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> They <HI>Chri&s;ten</HI> di&s;covering the whole Head, and pour|ing the Water on the hind-head, u&s;ing a trine A&s;per|&s;ion, which is al&s;o the practice of the <HI>Switzers.</HI> It vvas matter of much Edification, to &s;ee the great Numbers both here and all <HI>Switzerland</HI> over, that come every day to Prayers morning and evening.

The poor Mini&s;ters here are under a terrible &s;lavery: for the <HI>Gri&s;ons</HI> pretend that in all times they had not only the Patronage of their Churches, but a power to di&s;mi&s;s their Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">rch-men as they &s;aw cau&s;e. How it is among the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> I cannot tell, but the Dean of the Synod of the <HI>Hou&s;e of God</HI> told me they had an ill cu&s;tom of ordaining their Mini&s;ters without a Title, upon an Examination of their Qualifications and Abi|lities, which took them up generally &s;ix or &s;even hours: and when this Tryal was thus di&s;patched, if the Per&s;on was found qualified, they ordained him; and it was too ordinary for tho&s;e that were thus or|dained, to endeavour to undermine the Mini&s;ters al|ready in Employment, if their people grew di&s;gu&s;t|ed at them, or as they became di&s;abled by Age: and often the Intere&s;t and Kindred of the Intruder carried the matter again&s;t the Incumbent without any colour or pretence; and in that ca&s;e the Synod was bound to receive the Intruder.

The Liquor being &s;ingular, I informed my &s;elf particu|larly of the way of preparing it: the Grapes are red, tho it drinks white; they let the Grapes hang on the Vines till <HI>November</HI> that they are extream ripe, then they carry them to their Gar|rets, and &s;et them all upright on their ends by one another for two or three months, then they pick all the Grapes and throw away tho&s;e in which there is the lea&s;t appearance of rottenne&s;s, &s;o that they pre&s;s none but &s;ound Grapes: after they are pre&s;&s;ed they put the Liquor in an open Ve&s;&s;el, in which it throws up a &s;cum, which they take off twice a day, and when no more &s;cum comes up, which according to the difference of the &s;ea&s;on is &s;ooner or later, for &s;ometimes the &s;cum comes no more after eight days, and at other times it continues a Fortnight, then they put it in a clo&s;e Ve&s;&s;el; for the fir&s;t year it is extream &s;weet and lu&s;cious, but at the end of the year they pierce it a little higher then the middle of the Ve&s;&s;el, almo&s;t two thirds from the bottom, and drink it off till it cometh &s;o low, and then every year they fill it up a new: once a year in the month of <HI>March</HI> it ferments, and cannot be drunk till that is over, which continues a month, but their other Wine ferments not at that time. <HI>Madam Salis</HI> a

From this we went into the <HI>Canale,</HI> which <HI>Francis</HI> the fir&s;t cut from this River to the Town of <HI>Milan,</HI> which is about Thirty foot broad, and on both its banks there are &s;uch provi&s;i|ons to di&s;charge the Water when it ri&s;es, to &s;uch a height, that it can never be fuller of Water then is intended it &s;hould be; it lies al&s;o &s;o even that &s;ome|times for &s;ix miles together one &s;ees the line &s;o ex|act that there is not the lea&s;t crook; it is Thirty miles long, and is the be&s;t advantage that the Town of <HI>Milan</HI> hath for Water carriage.</P>
<P>I will not entertain you with a long de&s;cription of this great City, which is one of the noble&s;t in the World, to be an Inland Town that hath no great Court, no commerce either by Sea or any Naviga|ble River, and that is now the Metropolis of a ve|ry &s;mall State; for that which is not Mountainous in this &s;tate, is not above &s;ixty miles &s;quare, and yet it produces a wealth that is &s;urprizing: It paies for an e&s;tabli&s;hment of Seven and Forty Thou&s;and Men, and yet there are not Sixteen Thou&s;and Souldiers effectively in it, &s;o many are eat up by tho&s;e in who&s;e hands the Government is lodged: But the va&s;tne&s;s of the Town, the Noblene&s;s of the Buildings, and a|bove all the &s;urprizing riches of the Churches and Convents are &s;igns of great wealth: The Dome hath nothing to commend it of Architecture, it being built in the rude <HI>Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ick</HI> manner, but for the va&s;t|ne&s;s
<PB N="47" REF="45"> and riches of the Building, it is equal to any in <HI>Italy,</HI> S. <HI>Peters</HI> it &s;elf not excepted. It is all marble, both pavement, and Walls both out&s;ide and in&s;ide, and on the top it is all flagg'd with Marble; and there is the va&s;te&s;t number of niches for Statues of Marble, both within and without, that are any where to be &s;een. It is true the Statues in &s;ome of the ni|ches are not proportioned to the niches them&s;elves; the Fronti&s;piece is not yet made, it is to be all o|ver covered with Statues and <HI>bas reliefs;</HI> and the Pillars of which there are Four rows in the body of the Church, have each of them Eight niches at the top for &s;o many Statues; and though one would think this Church &s;o full of Statues, that almo&s;t e|very Saint hath his &s;tatue, yet I was a&s;&s;ured they wanted Seven Thou&s;and to fini&s;h the de&s;ign, but the&s;e mu&s;t chiefly belong to the Fronti&s;piece: The Church as I could mea&s;ure it by walking over it in an equal pace, is Five Hundred foot long, and Two Hundred wide; the Quire is wain&s;chotted and cary|ed in &s;o extraordinary a manner, that I never &s;aw Pa&s;&s;ion &s;o well expre&s;&s;ed in Wood; it contains Six|ty &s;talls, and they have almo&s;t all the Hi&s;tories of the Go&s;pel repre&s;ented in them. Ju&s;t under the Cupulo lies S. <HI>Carlo</HI>'s body, as I was told, in a great ca&s;e of Cri&s;tal of va&s;t value, but I could not come near it; for we were there on two Holy-days, and there was a perpetual crowd about it; and the &s;uper&s;tition of the People for his body, is &s;uch, that on a Holy-day one runs a hazard that comes near it without doing &s;ome reverence. His Canonization co&s;t the Town a Hundred Thou&s;and Crowns, they pretend they have miracles too, for Cardinal <HI>Fre|derigo Borromee;</HI> but they will not &s;et about his Ca|nonization, the price is &s;o high. The Plate and o|ther pre&s;ents made to S. <HI>Carlo</HI> are things of a prodi|gious value; &s;ome &s;ervices for the Altar are all of Gold, &s;ome very ma&s;&s;ie and &s;et with Jewels, others
<PB N="48" REF="46"> &s;o finely wrought that the fa&s;hion is thought equal to the value of the mettle; the Habits and all the other Ornaments for the Function of his Canoniza|tion are all of an incredible Wealth. He was in|deed a Prelate of great merit, and according to the an&s;wer that a Frier made to <HI>Philip de Comines,</HI> when he asked him how they came to qualifie one of the wor&s;t of their Princes with the Title of Saint in an In&s;cription which he read, which was that they gave that Title to all their Benefactors; never Man de&s;erved of a Town this Title &s;o ju&s;tly as Cardinal <HI>Borromee</HI> did, for he laid out a prodigious Wealth in <HI>Milan,</HI> leaving nothing to his Family, but the honour of having produced &s;o great a Man, which is a real temporal Inheritance to it, for as there have been, &s;ince that time, two Cardinals of that Family, &s;o it is e&s;teemed a <HI>Ca&s;a Santa;</HI> and e|very time that it produces an Eccle&s;ia&s;tick of any con&s;iderable merit, he is &s;ure, if he lives to it, to be rai&s;ed to this Arch-bi&s;hoprick, for if there were one of the Family capable of it, and that did not carry it that alone might di&s;po&s;e the State to a Re|bellion, and he were a bold Man that would ad|venture on a competition with one of this Family. He laid out a great deal on the Dome and con&s;ecra|ted it, though the work will not be quite fini&s;hed yet for &s;ome Ages, that being one of the crafts of the <HI>Italian</HI> Prie&s;ts never to fini&s;h a great de&s;ign, that &s;o by keeping it &s;till in an unfini&s;ht e&s;tate, they may be always drawing great donatives to it, from the &s;uper&s;tition of the People. He built the Arch-Bi|&s;hops Palace, which is very noble, and a &s;eminary, a Colledge for the <HI>Switzers,</HI> &s;everal Pari&s;h Church|es, and many Convents. In &s;hort the whole Town is full of the marks of his Wealth. The riches of the Churches of <HI>Milan</HI> &s;trike one with amazement, the Building, the Painting, the Altars, and the Plate, and every thing in the Convents, except their Li|braires,
<PB N="49" REF="46"> are all &s;igns both of great Wealth and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> a very powerful &s;uper&s;tition, but their Libraires not only here, but all <HI>Italy</HI> over are &s;candalous things, the room is often fine and richly adorned, but the Books are few, ill bound, and wor&s;e cho&s;en, and the ignorance of the Prie&s;ts both Secular and Regular is &s;uch, that no Man that hath not had occa&s;ion to di&s;|cover it, can ea&s;ily believe it. The Convent of S. <HI>Victor</HI> that is without the Town, is by much the riche&s;t, it is compo&s;ed of Canons Regular, called in <HI>Italy</HI> the Order of <HI>Mount Olive,</HI> or <HI>Olivetan,</HI> that of the <HI>Bernabites</HI> is extream rich, there is a Pulpit and a Confe&s;&s;ional all inlaid with Agates of different co|lours, finely &s;potted Marbles, and of <HI>Lapis Lazulis</HI> that are thought almo&s;t ine&s;timable. S. <HI>Laurence</HI> has a noble <HI>Cupulo,</HI> and a Pulpit of the &s;ame form with that of the <HI>Bernabites.</HI> The <HI>Je&s;uits,</HI> the <HI>Theatines,</HI> the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> and S. <HI>Seba&s;tians</HI> are very rich. The Cittadel is too well known to need a de&s;cription, it is very regularly built, and is a mo&s;t effectual re|&s;traint to keep the Town in order, but it could not &s;tand out again&s;t a good Army three days; for it is &s;o little, and &s;o f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ll of buildings, that it could not re&s;i&s;t a &s;howr of Bombs. The Ho&s;pital is indeed a Royal Building, I was told it had Ninety Thou&s;and Crowns Revenue: The old Court is large, and would look noble if it were not for the new Court that is near it, which is Two Hundred and Fifty foot &s;quare, and there are three rows of Corridors or Galleries all round the Court, one in every &s;tage ac|cording to the <HI>Italian</HI> manner, which makes the lodgings very convenient, and gives a Gallery be|fore every door: It is true the&s;e take up a great deal of the Building, being ordinarily Eight or Ten foot broad; but then here is an open &s;pace that is extream cool on that &s;ide where the Sun doth not lie, for it is all open to the Air, the Wall being on|ly &s;upported by Pillars, at the di&s;tance of Fifteen or
<PB N="50" REF="47"> Twenty foot one from another. In this Ho&s;pital there are not only Galleries full of Beds on both &s;ides, as is ordinary in all Ho&s;pitals; but there are al&s;o a great many Chambers in which Per&s;ons who&s;e condition was formerly di&s;tingui&s;hed are treated with a particular care. There is an out-hou&s;e which is called the <HI>Lazarette,</HI> that is without the Walls, which belongs to this Ho&s;pital, it is an exact quar|ter of a mile &s;quare, and there are Three Hundred and Sixty Rooms in it, and a Gallery runs all along before the Chambers, &s;o that as the &s;ervice is conve|nient, the &s;ick have a covered walk before their Doors. In the middle of this va&s;t &s;quare there is an <HI>Octangular</HI> Chappel, &s;o contrived that the &s;ick from all their Beds may &s;ee the elevation of the Ho|&s;tie and adore it: This Hou&s;e is for the Plague or for infectious Feavers, and the Sick that want a freer Air, are al&s;o removed hither.</P>
<P>As for the devotions of this place, I &s;aw here the <HI>Ambro&s;ian</HI> Office, which is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the <HI>Ro|man,</HI> both in the Mu&s;ick which is much &s;impler, and in &s;ome other rites: the Go&s;pel is read in a high Pulpit at the lower end of the Quire, that &s;o it may be heard by all the People, though this is needle&s;s, &s;ince it is read in a Language that they do not un|der&s;tand; when they go to &s;ay high Ma&s;s, the Prie&s;ts comes from the high Altar to the lower-end of the Quire, where the Offertory of the Bread and the Wine is made by &s;ome of the Laity, they were Nuns that made it when I was there, I heard a <HI>Capucin</HI> Preach here; it was the fir&s;t Sermon I heard in <HI>Italy,</HI> and I was much &s;urprized at many Comical expre&s;|&s;ions and ge&s;tures, but mo&s;t of all with the conclu&s;i|on; for there being in all the Pulpits of <HI>Italy</HI> a Cru|cifix on the &s;ide of the Pulpit towards the Altar; he, after a long addre&s;s to it, at la&s;t in a forced tran&s;port, took it in his Arms and hugged it and ki&s;&s;ed it: But I ob&s;erved that before he ki&s;s'd it; he &s;eeing &s;ome du&s;t
<PB N="51" REF="47"> on it, blew it off very carefully, for I was ju&s;t under the Pulpit: He entertained it with a long and tender care&s;s, and held it out to the People, and would have forced tears both from him&s;elf and them, yet I &s;aw none &s;hed. But if the Sermon in the Morning &s;ur|prized me, I wondred no le&s;s at two di&s;cour&s;es that I heard in one Church, at the &s;ame time, in the af|ternoon; for there were two bodies of Men &s;et down in different places of the Church all covered, and two Lay-men in ordinary habits were entertaining them with di&s;cour&s;es of Religion in a Catechetical &s;tile: The&s;e were Confrairies, and tho&s;e were &s;ome of the more devout that in&s;tructed the re&s;t. This I never &s;aw any where el&s;e, &s;o I do not know whether it is peculiar to <HI>Milan</HI> or not. My Conductor could not &s;peak <HI>Latin,</HI> and the <HI>Italian</HI> there is &s;o different from the true <HI>Tu&s;can,</HI> which I only knew, that I could not under&s;tand him when he was engaged in a long di&s;cour&s;e, &s;o I was not clearly informed of this matter; but I am apt to think it might have been &s;ome in&s;titution of Cardinal <HI>Borromees.</HI> The <HI>Ambro|&s;ian</HI> Library founded by Cardinal <HI>Frederick Borromee</HI> is a very noble Room and well furni&s;hed, only it is too full of School-men and Canoni&s;ts, which are the chief &s;tudies of <HI>Italy,</HI> and it hath too few Books of a more &s;olid and u&s;eful learning. One part of the di&s;|po&s;ition of the Room was plea&s;ant, there is a great number of Chairs placed all round it at a competent di&s;tance from one another, and to every Chair there belongs a Desk with an Ecritoire that hath Pen, Ink, and Paper in it, &s;o that every Man finds tools here for &s;uch extracts as he would make. There is a little Room of Manu&s;cripts at the end of the great Gallery, but the Library-keeper knows little of them, a great many of them relate to their Saint <HI>Charles.</HI> I &s;aw &s;ome fragments of <HI>Latin</HI> Bibles, but none &s;eemed to be above Six Hundred Years old, there are al&s;o &s;ome fragments of Saint <HI>Ambro&s;es</HI> works, and of Saint <HI>Je|rom</HI>'s
<PB N="52" REF="48"> Epi&s;tle that are of the &s;ame antiquity. I was &s;orry not to find St. <HI>Ambro&s;e</HI>'s Works intire, that I might have &s;een whether the Books of the Sacraments are a&s;cribed to him in ancient Copies, for perhaps they belong to a more modern Author.</P>
<P>It is true, in the&s;e Books the Doctrine of a &s;ort of a Corporal Pre&s;ence is a&s;&s;erted in very high expre&s;|&s;ions; but there is one thing mentioned in them, which is &s;tronger again&s;t it than all tho&s;e citations can be for it; for the Author gives us the formal words of the Prayer of Con&s;ecration in his time, which he Prefaces with &s;olemnity: Will you know how the change is wrought, hear the Heavenly words? For the Prie&s;t &s;aith, but whereas in the pre&s;ent Canon of the Ma&s;s, the Prayer of Con&s;ecration is for a good part of it very near in the &s;ame words with tho&s;e which he mentions, there is one e&s;&s;ential difference, for in the Canon they now pray that the Ho&s;ty may be to them the Body and Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> (which by the way doth not agree too well with the notion of Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, and approacheth more to the Do|ctrine of the <HI>Lutherians:</HI>) whereas in the Prayer, cited by that Author, the Ho&s;ty is &s;aid to be the fi|gure of the Body and Blood of <HI>Chri&s;t:</HI> here is the lan|guage of the whole Church of that time, and in the mo&s;t important part of the divine Office, which &s;ig|nifieth more to me than a Thou&s;and Quotations out of particular Writers, which are but their private opinions: But this is the voice of the whole body in its addre&s;&s;es to God: And it &s;eems the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> when the new Doctrine of the Corporal Pre|&s;ence was received, &s;aw that this Prayer of Con&s;e|cration could not con&s;i&s;t with it, which made her change &s;uch a main part of the Office. This gave me a curio&s;ity every where to &s;earch for ancient Offices, but I &s;ound none in the Abbey of St. <HI>Germains</HI> that &s;eemed older than the times of <HI>Charles</HI> the Great; &s;o I found none of any great Antiquity in all <HI>Italy:</HI>
<PB N="53" REF="48"> Tho&s;e publi&s;hed by Cardinal <HI>Bona,</HI> and &s;ince by <HI>P. Ma|billon,</HI> that were brought from <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> are the mo&s;t ancient that are in the <HI>Vatican;</HI> but the&s;e &s;eem not to be above Eight hundred Years old: There are none of the ancient <HI>Roman</HI> Offices now to be &s;een in the <HI>Vatican.</HI> I was amazed to find none of any great Antiquity; which made me conclude that either they were de&s;troyed, that &s;o the difference between Ancient and Modern Rituals might not be turned a|gain&s;t that Church, as an undeniable Evidence to prove the Changes that &s;he hath made in divine mat|ters, or that they were &s;o well kept that Hereticks were not to be &s;uffered to look into them. But to return to the <HI>Ambro&s;ian</HI> Library, there is in it a Ma|nu&s;cript of great Antiquity, though not of &s;uch great con&s;equence, which is <HI>Ruffinus</HI>'s Tran&s;lation of <HI>Jo&s;e|phus,</HI> that is written in the old <HI>Roman</HI> hand, which is very hard to read. But there is a deed in the curi|ous Collection that Count <HI>Ma&s;cardo</HI> hath made at <HI>Ve|rona,</HI> which by the date appears to have been written in <HI>Theodo&s;ius</HI>'s time, which is the &s;ame &s;ort of wri|ting with the Manu&s;cript of <HI>Ruffinus,</HI> &s;o that it may be reckoned to have been writ in <HI>Ruffinus</HI>'s own time, and this is the mo&s;t valuable, though the lea&s;t known curio&s;ity in the whole Library.</P>
<P>I need not &s;ay any thing of the curious Works in Cry&s;tal that are to be &s;een in <HI>Milan;</HI> the greate&s;t quan|tities that are in <HI>Europe,</HI> are found in the <HI>Alps;</HI> and are wrought here; but this is too well known to need any further enlargement. It is certain, the <HI>Alps</HI> have much Wealth &s;hut up in their Rocks, if the Inhabi|tants knew how to &s;earch for it: But I heard of no Mines that were wrought except Iron Mines; yet by the colourings, that in many places, the Fountains make, as they run along the Rocks, one &s;ees cau&s;e to believe that there are Mines and Minerals &s;hut up within them.

<P>The la&s;t Curio&s;ity that I &s;hall mention of the Town of <HI>Milan,</HI> is the Cabinet of the Chanoine <HI>Settala,</HI> which is now in his Brothers hands, where there are a great many very valuable things, both of Art and Nature: there is a lump of Ore, in which there is both Gold, Silver, Emeralds, and Diamonds, which was brought from <HI>Peru.</HI> There are many curious mo|tions where by an un&s;een Spring, a Ball, after it hath rowled down through many winding de&s;cents, is thrown up, and &s;o it &s;eems to be a perpetual motion; This is done in &s;everal forms, and is well enough di&s;|gui&s;ed to deceive the vulgar. Many motions of little Animals that run about by Springs, are al&s;o very pret|ty. There is a Load&s;tone of a va&s;t force that carries a great Chain: There is al&s;o a mon&s;trous Child that was lately born in the Ho&s;pital, which is pre&s;erved in Spirit of Wine: It is double below, it hath one Brea&s;t and Neck, two pair of Ears, a va&s;t Head, and but one Face.

There is one inconvenience in <HI>Milan,</HI> which throws down all the plea&s;ure that one can find in it: they have no Gla&s;s Windows, &s;o that one is either expo&s;ed to the Air, or &s;hut up in a Dungeon: and this &s;o univer&s;al, that there is not one hou&s;e of ten that hath Gla&s;s in their Windows: The &s;ame defect is in <HI>Florence,</HI> be&s;ides all the &s;mall Towns of <HI>Italy,</HI> which is an effect of their poverty: For what by the oppre&s;|&s;ion of the Government, what by the no le&s;s &s;queezing oppre&s;&s;ion of their Prie&s;ts, who drain all the re&s;t of their Wealth that is not eat up by the Prince, to inrich their Churches and Convents, the People here are re|duced to a poverty, that cannot be ea&s;ily believed by one that &s;ees the Wealth that is in their Churches, and this is going on &s;o con&s;tantly in <HI>Milan,</HI> that it is

<PB N="56" REF="50"> who is a worthy Man, and hath &s;uch tenderne&s;s for her, that he furni&s;heth her with Ma&s;ters of all &s;orts, ordered Letters to be carved in Wood, and &s;he by feel|ing the Characters formed &s;uch an Idea of them, that &s;he writes with a Crayon &s;o di&s;tinctly, that her wri|ting can be well read, of which I have &s;everal E&s;&s;ays. I &s;aw her write, &s;he doth it more nimbly than can be ima|gined; &s;he hath a Machine that holds the Paper, and keeps her always in line. But that which is above all the re&s;t, &s;he is a per&s;on of extraordinary Devotion, great re&s;ignation to the Will of God, and a profound humility: The Preceptor that the Father kept in the hou&s;e with her, hath likewi&s;e a wonderful faculty of acquiring Tongues. When he came fir&s;t to <HI>Geneva,</HI> (for he is of <HI>Zurich</HI>) he &s;poke not a word of <HI>French,</HI> and within Thirteen months he Preacht in <HI>French</HI> correctly, and with a good accent: He al&s;o began to &s;tudy <HI>Italian</HI> in the month of <HI>November,</HI> and before the end of the following <HI>February</HI> he preacht in <HI>Ita|lian;</HI> his accent was good, and his &s;tile was florid, which was very extraordinary, for the <HI>Italian</HI> langu|age is not &s;poken in <HI>Geneva,</HI> though the Race of the <HI>Italians</HI> do keep up &s;till an <HI>Italian</HI> Church there.</P>

<PB N="58" REF="51"> that both the&s;e are in one Per&s;on. We were there in the time of the Fair, Linnen Cloath and Chee&s;e, which though it goes by the name of <HI>Parme&s;an,</HI> is made chiefly in <HI>Lodi,</HI> are the main Ingredients of the Fair. The magnificence of the <HI>Pode&s;ta</HI> appeared very extra|ordinary, for he went through the Fair with a great train of Coaches, all in his own Livery; and the two Coaches in which he and his Lady ride, were both extraordinary rich: his was a huge Bed-coach, all the out &s;ide black Velvet, and a mighty rich Gold fringe, lined with black Damask, flowred with Gold. From <HI>Crema</HI> it is Thirty miles to <HI>Bre&s;cia,</HI> which is a great Town, and full of Trade and Wealth, here they make the be&s;t Barrils for Pi&s;tols and Muskets of all <HI>Italy:</HI> There are great Iron Works near it; but the War with the <HI>Turk</HI> had occa&s;ioned an Order that none be &s;old without a permi&s;&s;ion from <HI>Venice:</HI> They are building a Noble Dome at <HI>Bre&s;cia:</HI> I was &s;hewed a Nunnery there, which is now under a great di&s;grace, &s;ome years ago a new Bi&s;hop coming thither, began with the Vi&s;itation of that Nunnery: he di&s;covered two Vaults, by one, Men came ordinarily into it: and by another the Nuns that were big went and lay-in of Child-bed: when he was examining the Nuns &s;everely concerning tho&s;e Vaults, &s;ome of them told him, that his own Prie&s;ts did much wor&s;e: He &s;hut up the Nuns, &s;o that tho&s;e who are profe&s;&s;ed live &s;till there, but none come to take the Vail: and by this means the Hou&s;e will &s;oon come to an end: The Cittadel lies over the Town on a Rock, and commands it ab&s;o|lutely. Both here and in <HI>Crema</HI> the Towns have be|gun a Complement within the&s;e la&s;t Ten or Twelve Years to their <HI>Pode&s;ta</HI>'s, which is a matter of great Ornament to their Palaces, but will grow to a va&s;t charge, for they erect Statues to their <HI>Pode&s;ta</HI>'s: and this being once begun, mu&s;t be carried on: otherwi&s;e tho&s;e, to whom the like Honour is not done, will re&s;ent it as a high affront, and the revenges of the
<PB N="59" REF="51"> Noble <HI>Venetians,</HI> are dreadful things their to Subjects. This name of <HI>Pode&s;ta</HI> is very ancient, for in the Roman times, the chief Magi&s;trates of the le&s;&s;er Towns was called the <HI>Pote&s;tas,</HI> as appears by that of <HI>Juveral-Fide|narum Gabiorumve e&s;&s;e pote&s;tas.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Bre&s;cia</HI> the beauty of <HI>Lombardy</HI> is a little in|terrupted; for as all the way from <HI>Milan</HI> to <HI>Bre&s;cia</HI> is as one Garden, &s;o here on the one &s;ide we come under the Mountains, and we pa&s;s by the Lake of <HI>Guarda,</HI> which is Forty miles long, and where it is broade&s;t, is Twenty miles broad: The miles indeed, all <HI>Lombardy</HI> over, are extream &s;hort, for I walkt often four or five miles in a walk, and I found a Thou&s;and paces made their common mile; but in <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Naples,</HI> the mile is Fifteen Hundred pa|ces. We pa&s;s through a great Heath for Seven or Eight miles on this &s;ide of <HI>Verona,</HI> which begins to be cultivated. <HI>Verona</HI> is a va&s;t Town, and much of it well built; there are many rich Churches in it; but there is &s;o little Trade &s;tirring, and &s;o little money going, that it is not ea&s;ie here to change a Pi&s;tol, without taking their coin of ba&s;e alloy, which doth not pa&s;s out of the <HI>Verone&s;e;</HI> for this &s;eems a &s;trange maxim of the <HI>Venetians</HI> to &s;uffer tho&s;e &s;mall &s;tates, to retain &s;till a coin peculiar to them, which is extream inconvenient for Commerce. The known Antiquity of <HI>Verona</HI> is the Amphitheater, one of the lea&s;t of all that the <HI>Romans</HI> built, but the be&s;t pre&s;erved, for though mo&s;t of the great &s;tones of the out-&s;ide are pickt out; yet the great flopping Vault on which the rows of the &s;eats are al&s;o intire, they are four and forty rows, every row is a foot and half high, and as much in breadth, &s;o that a Man &s;its conveni|ently in them, under the feet of tho&s;e of the higher row: and allowing every Man a foot and a half, the whole Amphitheater can hold Twenty three thou&s;and per&s;ons. In the Vaults, under the rows of &s;eats, were the Stalls for the Bea&s;ts that were pre&s;ented to enter|tain
<PB N="60" REF="52"> the Company: the thickne&s;s of the building, from the outward Wall to the lowe&s;t row of &s;eats, is ninety foot: But this Noble remnant of Antiquity is &s;o of|ten and &s;o copiou&s;ly de&s;cribed, that I will &s;ay no more of it. The next thing of value is the famous <HI>Mu&s;eum Calceolarium,</HI> now in the hands of the Count <HI>Ma&s;car|do,</HI> where there is a whole apartment of Rooms all furni&s;ht with Antiquities and Rarities: There are &s;ome old In&s;criptions made by two Towns in <HI>Africk,</HI> to the Honour of <HI>M. Cra&s;&s;us:</HI> There is a great collection of Medals and Medaillons, and of the <HI>Roman</HI> Weights, and their In&s;truments for their Sacrifices, there are many Curio&s;ities of Nature, and a great collection of Pictures, of which many are of <HI>Paulo Verone&s;e</HI>'s hand. There is a noble Garden in <HI>Verona</HI> that ri&s;eth up in Terra&s;&s;es the whole heigth of a Hill, in which there are many ancient In&s;criptions, which belongs to Count <HI>Giu&s;to.</HI> As we go from <HI>Verona</HI> to <HI>Vincenza</HI> which is thirty miles, we return to the beauty of <HI>Lombardy,</HI> for there is all the way as it were a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Gardens, the Ground is better cultivated here than I &s;aw it in any other place of <HI>Italy:</HI> But the Wine is not good, for at the roots of all their Trees they plant a Vine which grows up winding about the Tree to which it joins; but the Soil is too rich to produce a rich Wine, for that requires a dry ground: There is near the Lake of <HI>Guarda</HI> a very extraordinary Wine which they call <HI>Vino Santo,</HI> which drinks like the be&s;t &s;ort of <HI>Canary,</HI> it is not made till <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> and from thence it carries the name of <HI>Holy Wine,</HI> and it is not to be drunk till Mid&s;ummer, for it is &s;o long before it is quite wrought clear, but I have not marked down how long it may be kept: We had it there for a groat an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> quart, I wondred that they did not Trade with it. All the Cattle of <HI>Italy</HI> are gray or white, and all their Hogs are black, except in the <HI>Bologne&s;e,</HI> and there they are red. I will not inquire into the rea&s;ons of the&s;e things: It is certain Hogs-Fle&s;h
<PB N="61" REF="52"> in <HI>Italy</HI> is much better than it is in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> whether the truffs on which they feed much in Winter, occa&s;ion this or not, I know not, the husks of the pre&s;&s;ed Grapes is al&s;o a mighty nouri&s;h|ment to them; but Cattel of that grayi&s;h colour are certainly weaker: The carriage of <HI>Italy</HI> is generally performed by them, and this is very hard work in <HI>Lombardy</HI> when it hath rained never &s;o little, for the ground being quite level, and there being no rai&s;ed High-ways or Cau&s;e-ways, the Carts go deep and are hardly drawn.</P>
<P><HI>Vincenza</HI> hath &s;till more of its ancient liberty re|&s;erved than any of the&s;e Towns, as <HI>Padua</HI> hath le&s;s, for it delivered it &s;elf to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> whereas the other di&s;puted long with it, and brought it often very low: one &s;ees the marks of Liberty in <HI>Vincenza</HI> in the riches of their Palaces and Churches, of which many are newly built: They have a modern Theater made in imitation of the ancient <HI>Roman</HI> Theaters. Count <HI>Valarano</HI>'s Gardens at the Port of <HI>Verona,</HI> is the &s;ine&s;t thing of the Town, there is in it a very noble Alley of Oranges and Cttrons, &s;ome as big as a Mans body, but tho&s;e are covered all the Winter long, for in this appears the &s;en&s;ible difference of <HI>Lombardy</HI> from tho&s;e parts of <HI>Italy,</HI> that lies to the <HI>South</HI> of the <HI>Apenins,</HI> that here generally they keep their Oranges and Citrons in great Boxes as we do in <HI>England,</HI> that &s;o they may be lodged in Winter, and defended from the breezes that blow &s;ometimes &s;o &s;harp from the <HI>Alps,</HI> that o|therwi&s;e they would kill tho&s;e delicate Plants: where|as in <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI> they grow as other Trees in their Gar|dens, and in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples</HI> they grow wild without any care or cultivation. We were at <HI>Vin|cenza</HI> upon a Holy-day, and there I &s;aw a prepara|tion for a Proce&s;&s;ion that was to be in the afternoon: I did not wonder at what a <HI>French</HI> Papi&s;t &s;aid to me, that he could hardly bear the Religion of <HI>Italy,</HI> the Idolatry in it was &s;o gro&s;s. The &s;tatue of the Virgin
<PB N="62" REF="53"> was of Wood &s;o finely painted, that I thought the Head was Wax, it was richly clad, and had a Crown on its Head, and was &s;et full of Flowers: how they did when it was carried about, I do not know; but in the morning all People run to it and &s;aid their Prayers to it, ond ki&s;&s;ed the ground before it with all the appearances of devotion.</P>
<P>From <HI>Vincenza</HI> it is Eighteen miles to <HI>Padua</HI> all like a Garden; here one &s;ees the decays of a va&s;t City, which was, once, one of the bigge&s;t of all <HI>Italy;</HI> the compa&s;s is the &s;ame that it was, but there is much uninhabited ground in it, and Hou&s;es there go almo&s;t for nothing, their Air is extream good, and there is &s;o great a plenty of all things except money, that a little money goes a great way. The Univer&s;ity here, though &s;o much &s;upported by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> that they pay fifty Profe&s;&s;ors, yet &s;inks extreamly: there are no Men of any great fame now in it: and the quar|rels among the Students have driven away mo&s;t of the &s;trangers that u&s;ed to come and &s;tudy here, for it is not &s;afe to &s;tir abroad here after Sun &s;et: The number of the Palaces here is incredible, and though the Nobility of <HI>Padua</HI> is almo&s;t quite ruined, yet the beauty of their ancient Palaces &s;hews what they once were. The <HI>Venetians</HI> have been willing to let the ancient quarrels that were in all tho&s;e con|quered Cities continue &s;till among them, for while one kills another, and the Children of the other take their revenges afterwards, both comes under the <HI>bando</HI> by this means, and the Confi&s;cation goes to the Se|nate. At &s;ome times of grace when the Senate wants Money, and offers a Pardon to all that will compound for it, the numbers of the guilty Per&s;ons are incredible. In <HI>Vincenza</HI> and the Country that belongs to it, I was a&s;&s;ured by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Patin,</HI> that learned Antiquary, that hath been many years a Profe&s;&s;or in <HI>Padua,</HI> that there were Five and thirty thou&s;and pardoned at the la&s;t Grace; this I could hardly believe, but he bid me
<PB N="63" REF="53"> write it down upon his word. The Nobility of <HI>Padua</HI> and of the other Towns, &s;eem not to &s;ee what a profit their quarrels bring to the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and how they eat out their Families: For one Family in the &s;ame Man's time, who was alive while I was there, was redu|ced from Fourteen thou&s;and Ducats revenue to le&s;s than Three thou&s;and, by its falling at &s;everal times under the <HI>bando:</HI> But their jealou&s;ies and their reven|ges are pur&s;ued by them with &s;o much vigor, that when the&s;e are in their way, all other things are for|got by them. There is here the remnant of the Am|phitheater, though nothing but the outward Wall &s;tands: There is here, as well as in <HI>Milan,</HI> an inward Town, called the City, and an outward, without that, called the <HI>Burgo;</HI> but though there is a Ditch about the City, the great Ditch and Wall goeth a|bout all and <HI>Padua</HI> is Eight miles in compa&s;s; it lies almo&s;t round: The publick Hall is the Noble&s;t of <HI>I|taly:</HI> the Dome is an ancient and mean Building; but the Church of St. <HI>Anthony,</HI> e&s;pecially the Holy Cha|pel in it where the Saint lies, is one of the be&s;t pie|ces of modern Sculpture; for round the Chapel the chief Miracles in the legend of that Saint are repre&s;en|ted in <HI>Mezzo rilievo,</HI> in a very &s;urprizing manner: The devotion that is paid to this Saint, all <HI>Lombardy</HI> over, is amazing; he is called by way of excellence <HI>il Santo,</HI> and the Beggars generally ask Alms for his &s;ake: But among the little, Vows that hang without the Holy Chapel, there is one that is the highe&s;t pitch of Bla&s;phemy that can be imagined <HI>Exaudit,</HI> &s;peaking of the Saint <HI>quos non audit &amp; ip&s;e Deus,</HI> he hears tho&s;e whom God him&s;elf doth not hear. St. <HI>Ju&s;tina</HI> is a Church &s;o well ordered within, the Architecture is &s;o beautiful, it is &s;o well inlightned, and the <HI>Cu|pulo</HI>'s are &s;o advantagiou&s;ly placed that if the out&s;ide an&s;wered the in&s;ide, it would be one of the be&s;t Churches of <HI>Italy,</HI> but the Building is of Brick, and it hath no Fronti&s;piece, there are many new Altars
<PB N="64" REF="54"> made as fine as they are Idolatrous, all full of Sta|tues of Marble. This Abby hath a Hundred Thou|&s;and Ducats of Revenue, and &s;o by its Wealth one may conclude that it belongs to the <HI>Benedictine</HI> Order. Cardinal <HI>Barberigo</HI> is Bi&s;hop here, he &s;eems to &s;et St. <HI>Carlo</HI> before him as his pattern; he hath founded a Noble Seminary for the &s;ecular Prie&s;ts; he lives in a con&s;tant di&s;cipline him&s;elf, and endeavours to reform his Clergy all he can; but he is now in ill terms with his Canons, who are all Noble <HI>Venetians,</HI> and &s;o al|low them&s;elves great liberties, of which they will not be willingly abridged; he is charitable to a high degree, and is in all re&s;pects a very extraordinary Man.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Venetian</HI> Territory, their &s;ubjects live ea&s;ie and happy, if they could be &s;o wi&s;e as to give over their quarrels, but though the taxes are not high, they oppre&s;s their Tenants &s;o &s;everely, that the Pe|&s;ants live mo&s;t mi&s;erably, yet on all hands round a|bout them, the oppre&s;&s;ions being more intollerable, they know not whither to go for ea&s;e, whereas on the contrary, the mi&s;eries under which their neighbours groan, chiefly tho&s;e of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical &s;tate, &s;end in an increa&s;e of People among them, &s;o that they are well &s;tockt with People, but the <HI>Venetians</HI> are &s;o jea|lous of their &s;ubjects under&s;tanding Military matters, which may di&s;po&s;e them to revolt, that they never make any Levies among them for their Wars, this jealou&s;ie is the true ground of that maxim, though another is pretended that is more plau&s;ible, which is their care of their own People, whom they &s;tudy to pre&s;erve, and therefore they hire Strangers rather than expo&s;e their Subjects. It is certain a revolt here were no hard matter to effectuate, for the Garri&s;ons and Fortifications are &s;o &s;light, that tho&s;e great Towns could ea&s;ily &s;hake off their yoke, if it were not for the factions that &s;till reign among them, by which one party would chu&s;e rather to expo&s;e the other to the rigor of the Inqui&s;itors than concur with them in a&s;|&s;erting

I went to the Convent of the <HI>Servi,</HI> but I found Father <HI>Paul</HI> was not in &s;uch con&s;ideration there, as he is el&s;e where: I asked for his Tomb, but they made no ac|count of him, and &s;eemed not to know where it was; it is true the Per&s;on to whom I was recommended was not in <HI>Venice,</HI> &s;o perhaps they refined too much in this matter: I had great di&s;cour&s;e with &s;ome at <HI>Venice</HI> concerning the memorials out of which <HI>F. Paul</HI> drew his Hi&s;tory, which are no doubt all pre|&s;erved with great care in their Archives, and &s;ince the tran&s;actions of the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> as they are of great importance, &s;o they are become now much con|troverted by the different relations that <HI>F. Paul,</HI> and Cardinal <HI>Pallavicini</HI> have given the World of that matter; the only way to put an end to all di&s;putes
<PB N="69" REF="56"> in matter of fact, is to print the Originals them&s;elves: A Per&s;on of great credit at <HI>Venice</HI> promi&s;ed to me to do his utmo&s;t, to get that propo&s;ition &s;et on foot, tho the great exactne&s;s that the Government there hath always affected as to the matter of their Archives, is held &s;o &s;acred that this made him apprehend they would not give way to any &s;uch &s;earch. The affinity of the matter brings into my mind a long Conver&s;a|tion that I had with a Per&s;on of great Eminence at <HI>Venice,</HI> that as he was long at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> &s;o was learned far beyond what is to be met with in <HI>Italy,</HI> he told me he was at <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> when the Inquiry into the Doctrine of the <HI>Greek</HI> Church was &s;et on foot, occa&s;ioned by the famous Di&s;pute between Mr. <HI>Arnaud</HI> and Mr. <HI>Claude,</HI> he being a zealous Roman Catholick, was dealt with to a&s;&s;i&s;t in that bu&s;ine&s;s; but being a Man of great Honour and Sincerity, he excu&s;ed him|&s;elf, and &s;aid he could not meddle in it: He hath a very low and bad opinion of the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and he told me that none of their Prie&s;ts were more inveterate enemies to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> than tho&s;e that were bred up at <HI>Rome;</HI> for they to free them&s;elves of the prejudices that their Countrey-men are apt to con|ceive again&s;t them, becau&s;e of their education among the <HI>Latines</HI> do affect to &s;hew an oppo&s;ition to the <HI>La|tin</HI> Church beyond any other <HI>Greeks.</HI> He told me that he knew the ignorance and corruption of the <HI>Greeks</HI> was &s;uch, that as they did not know the Do|ctrines of their own Church, &s;o a very little Money, or the hope of Protection from any of the Amba&s;&s;a|dors that come from the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> would prevail with them to &s;ign any that that co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ld be de&s;ired of them: He added one thing, that though he firmly believed Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation him&s;elf, he did not think they be|lieved it; let them &s;ay what they plea&s;ed them&s;elves, he took his mea&s;ures of the Doctrine of their Chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ch, rather from what they did, than from what they &s;aid:
<PB N="70" REF="57"> For their Rites not being changed now for a great many ages were the true Indications of the doctrines received among them; whereas they were both ig|norant of the tradition of their doctrine, and very apt to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">revaricate when they &s;aw advantages or pro|tection &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t before them, therefore he concluded that &s;ince they did not adore the Sacrament after the Con|&s;ecration, that was an evident &s;ign that they did not believe the corporal pre&s;ence, and was of a force well able to balance all their &s;ub&s;criptions: He told me he was often &s;candalized to &s;ee them open the bag in which the Sacrament was pre&s;erved, and &s;hew it with no &s;ort of re&s;pect no more than when they &s;hewed any Manu&s;cript, and he looked on adoration as &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, that he could not imagine that the latter was received in a Church that did not practice the former. To this I will add what an eminent <HI>Catholick</HI> at <HI>Paris</HI> told me, he &s;aid the Originals of tho&s;e atte&s;tations were in too exact and too correct a &s;tile to have been formed in <HI>Greece,</HI> he a&s;&s;ured me they were penned at <HI>Paris</HI> by one that was a Ma&s;ter of the purity of the <HI>Greek</HI> tongue. I do not name tho&s;e Per&s;ons becau&s;e they are yet alive, and this might be a prejudice to them, One of the chief Ornaments of <HI>Venice</HI> was the famous young Woman that &s;pake five Tongues well, of which the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> were two; &s;he pa&s;&s;ed Doctor of Phy&s;ick at <HI>Padua</HI> according to the ordinary forms; but which was beyond all, &s;he was a Per&s;on of &s;uch ex|traordinary vertue and piety, that &s;he is &s;poken of as a Saint, &s;he died &s;ome months before I came to <HI>Venice:</HI> &s;he was of the noble Family of the <HI>Cornara</HI>'s, though not of the three chief branches, which are <HI>Saint Mauri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e, Saint Paul</HI> and <HI>Calle,</HI> who are de&s;cen|ded from the three Brothers of the renowned Queen of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> but the di&s;tinction of her Family was <HI>Pi&s;|copia.</HI> Her extraordinary merit made all People un|willing
<PB N="71" REF="57"> to remember the blemi&s;h of her de&s;cent of the one &s;ide, for though the <HI>Cornara</HI>'s reckon them&s;elves a &s;ize of Nobility beyond all the other Families of <HI>Venice,</HI> yet her Father having entertained a <HI>Gondalier</HI>'s Daughter &s;o long that he had &s;ome Children by her, at la&s;t for their &s;akes Married the Mother, and payed a con&s;iderable fine to &s;ave the forfeiture of Nobility, which his Children mu&s;t have undergone, by rea&s;on of the meanne&s;s of the Mothers birth. The <HI>Cornara</HI>'s carry it &s;o high that many of the Daughters of that Family have made them&s;elves Nuns, becau&s;e they thought their own name was &s;o Noble that they could not induce them&s;elves to change it with any other, and when lately one of that Family married the Heir of the <HI>Sagredo,</HI> which is al&s;o one of the anciente&s;t Fa|milies that was extream rich, and &s;he had &s;carce any portion at all, for the <HI>Cornara</HI>'s are now very low, &s;ome of their Friends came to wi&s;h them joy of &s;o advantagious a match; but they very coldly rejected the complement, and bid the others go and wi&s;h the <HI>Sagreda</HI> joy, &s;ince they thought the advantage was wholly of their &s;ide.</P>
<P>There are of the truly ancient Noble Families of <HI>Venice</HI> Four and Twenty yet remaining, and even a|mong the&s;e there are twelve that are thought &s;uperior to the re&s;t in rank; &s;ince the fir&s;t formation of their Senate they have created many Senators. In their Wars with <HI>Genua</HI> they conferred that honour on Thirty Families; &s;everal of their Generals have had that honour given them as a reward of their &s;ervice: They have al&s;o offered this honour to &s;ome Royal Fa|milies: for both the Families of <HI>Valois</HI> and <HI>Bourbon</HI> were nobles of <HI>Venice,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the III. when he came through <HI>Venice</HI> from <HI>Poland</HI> to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Crown of <HI>France,</HI> went and &s;ate among them, and drew his ballot as a Noble <HI>Venetian;</HI> many Popes have procured this honour for their Nephews; Only the
<PB N="72" REF="58"> <HI>Barberines</HI> would have the <HI>Venetians</HI> offer it to them without their asking it, and the <HI>Venetians</HI> would not give it without the others asked it, and &s;o it &s;tuck at this. But during the War of <HI>Candy</HI> Cardinal <HI>Fran|cis Barberin</HI> gave Twelve Thou&s;and Crowns a Year towards the War, and the temper found for making th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">m Noble <HI>Venetians</HI> was, that the Queen Mother of <HI>France</HI> moved the Senate to grant it. In all the Cre|ations of Senators before the la&s;t War of <HI>Candy,</HI> they were free; and the con&s;iderations were either great &s;ervices, or the great dignity of tho&s;e on whom they be&s;towed this Honour. Tho&s;e new Families are di|vided into tho&s;e that are called Ducal Families, and tho&s;e that were called &s;imply new Families, the rea|&s;on of the former de&s;ignation is not rightly under|&s;tood; but one that knew all that related to that con|&s;titution particularly well gave me a good account of it: That which naturally occurs as the rea&s;on of it, is, that all tho&s;e Families that are called Ducal, have had the Dukedom in their hou&s;e: But as all the old Families have had the &s;ame honour, though they carry not that Title, &s;o &s;ome of the new Families have al&s;o had it, that yet are not called Ducal. O|thers &s;ay that tho&s;e Families that have had branches, who have been made Dukes, without their being fir&s;t Procurators of S. <HI>Mark,</HI> or that have been cho&s;en to that honour, without their pretending to it, are cal|led Ducal: But the true account of this is, that from the Year 1450. to the Year 1620. for a Hundred and Seventy Years there was a combination made among tho&s;e new Families to pre&s;erve the Dukedom &s;till a|mong them: For the old Families carrying it high, and excluding the new Families from the chief Ho|nours, Nineteen of the new Families entred into mu|tual engagements to exclude the ancient Nobility: It is true they made the Dukedom &s;ometimes fall on &s;ome of the new Families that were not of this A&s;&s;o|ciation;
<PB N="73" REF="58"> but this was more indifferent to them, as long as the ancient Families were &s;hut out, and that it appeared that they bore the chief &s;way in the Ele|ction. This Combination was a thing known to the very People, though the Inqui&s;itors did all they could to break it, and at lea&s;t to hide it, &s;o that I never met with it in any of their Authors: But this failed in the Year 1620. when <HI>Memmio</HI> was cho&s;en Duke, who was de&s;cended of one of the ancient Nobility, which was &s;o great a mortification to the ca&s;e Ducale that one of them <HI>(Venniero)</HI> hanged him&s;elf, by the rage to which that di&s;grace drove him, yet his Man came into the room in time before he was dead, and cut him down, and he lived long after that in a bet|ter mind. Since that time one of the <HI>Bembo</HI>'s, two of the <HI>Cornaro</HI>'s, and one of the <HI>Contrarini</HI>'s, and the pre&s;ent Prince of the <HI>Ju&s;tiniani,</HI> the fir&s;t of that Fa|mily that hath had that honour, have been Dukes, who are all of the ancient Families: So that this F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">|ction is now &s;o intirely buried, that it is not gene|rally known, even in <HI>Venice</HI> it &s;elf, that it was ever among&s;t them; and thus time and other accidents bring about happy events, which no care nor indu&s;try could produce: For that which all the endeavours of the Inqui&s;itors could not compa&s;s, was brought about of it &s;elf.</P>
<P>It is true, the Factions in <HI>Venice,</HI> though violent enough in the per&s;ons of tho&s;e who manage them, yet are not derived by them as an inheritance to their Po|&s;terity, as it was among the <HI>Florentines;</HI> who though they value them&s;elves as a &s;ize of Men much above the <HI>Venetians,</HI> whom they de&s;pi&s;e as a phlegmatick and dull race of People, yet &s;hewed how little they under&s;tood with all their vivacity, to conduct their &s;tate, &s;ince by their dome&s;tick heats they lo&s;t their liberty, which the <HI>Venetians</HI> have had the wi&s;|dom &s;till to pre&s;erve. This Faction of the Ca&s;e Du|cale
<PB N="74" REF="59"> was perhaps willing to let the matter fall, for they lo&s;t more than they got by it; for the ancient Families in revenge &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t them, and excluded them from all the other advantagious im|ployments of the State. For the others being only united in that &s;ingle point relating to the Dukedom, the ancient Families let them carry it, but in all o|ther Competitions they &s;et up always &s;uch Competi|tors again&s;t the pretenders that were of the Ducal Fa|milies, that were much more e&s;teemed than the&s;e were, &s;o that they &s;hut them out of all the be&s;t Offi|ces of the <HI>Republick.</HI> Such a Faction as this was, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">f it had been &s;till kept up, might in conclu&s;ion have proved fatal to their Liberty. It is indeed a wonder to &s;ee, the Dignity of the Duke &s;o much courted, for h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> is only a pri&s;oner of &s;tate, tied up to &s;uch rules, &s;o &s;everely r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;trained and &s;hut up as it were in an apartment of the Palace of St. <HI>Mark,</HI> that it is not &s;trange to &s;ee &s;ome of the greate&s;t Families, in par|ticular the <HI>Cornara</HI>'s, decline it. All the Family, if ever &s;o numerous, mu&s;t retire o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t of the Senate, when a Duke is cho&s;en out of it, only one that is next to him of kin &s;its &s;till, but without a Vote: And the only real Priviledge that the Duke hath, is, that he can of him&s;elf, without communicating with the <HI>Savii,</HI> propo&s;e matters, either to the Council of Ten; to the Senate, or to the Great Council; where|as all other propo&s;itions mu&s;t be fir&s;t offered to the <HI>Savii,</HI> and examined by them, who have a &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t of <HI>Tribunitian</HI> power to reject what they d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;like, and though they cannot hinder the Duke to make a pro|po&s;ition, yet they can mortifie him when he hath made it: They can h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">der it to be voted, and after it is voted they can &s;u&s;pend the execution of it till it is examined over again: And a Duke that is of an active Spirit mu&s;t re&s;olve to endure many of the&s;e afflictions, and it is certain that the <HI>Savii</HI> do &s;ome|times
<PB N="75" REF="59"> affect to &s;hew the greatne&s;s of their Autho|rity, and exerci&s;e a &s;ort of Tyranny in the reject|ing of Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;itions when they intend to humble tho&s;e that make them. Yet the greate&s;t part of the be&s;t Families court this Honour of Dukedom ex|treamly; when <HI>Segrado</HI> was upon the point of being cho&s;en Duke, there was &s;o violent an outcry again&s;t it over all <HI>Venice,</HI> becau&s;e of the di&s;grace, that they thought would come on the <HI>Republick,</HI> if they had a Prince who&s;e Note had mi&s;carried in &s;ome unfortunate di&s;orders, the Senate complyed &s;o far with this Aver&s;ion, that the People te&s;tified, That though the Inqui&s;itors took care to hang or drown many of the chief of the Mutineers, yet they let the de&s;ign for <HI>Sagredo</HI> fall: Upon which he was &s;o much di&s;gu&s;ted that he retired to a hou&s;e he had in the <HI>Terra firma,</HI> and never appeared more at <HI>Venice:</HI> During which time of his retirement, he writ two Books, the one <HI>Memorie Ottomaniche,</HI> which is Printed, and he is accounted the be&s;t of all the Modern Authors: The other was Memoir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the Government, and Hi&s;tory of <HI>Venice,</HI> which hath never been Printed; and &s;ome &s;ay it is too &s;incere, and too particular, &s;o that it is thought it will be re&s;erved among their Archives. It hath been a &s;ort of maxim now for &s;ome time, not to chu&s;e a married Man to be Duke, for the Co|ronation of a Dutche&s;s goes high, and hath co&s;t above Hundred thou&s;and Ducats. Some of the an|cient Families have affected the Title of Prince, and have called their branches Princes of the Blood, and though the <HI>Cornara</HI>'s have done this more than any other, yet others upon the account of &s;ome Principalities, that their Ance&s;tors had in the I&s;lands of the <HI>Archipelago,</HI> have al&s;o affected tho&s;e vain Titles: But the Inqui&s;itors have long ago obliged them to lay a&s;ide all tho&s;e high Titles,
<PB N="76" REF="60"> and &s;uch of them that boa&s;t too much of their Blood, find the di&s;like which that brings on them very &s;en&s;ibly; for when&s;oever they pretend to any great Employments, they find them&s;elves always excluded. When an Election of Amba&s;&s;adors was propo&s;ed, or of any of the chief Offices, it was wont to be made in tho&s;e terms, that the Coun|cil mu&s;t chu&s;e one of its principal Members for &s;uch an Employment: But becau&s;e this lookt like a term of di&s;tinction, among the Nobility, they changed it Five and twenty Years ago; and in&s;tead of Prin|cipal, they u&s;e now the term Honourable, which comprehends the whole body of the Nobility, with|out any di&s;tinction. It is at <HI>Venice</HI> in the Church, as well as in the State, that the Head of the Bo|dy hath a great Title, and particular Honours done him; whereas in the mean while this is a meer Pageantry, and under the&s;e big words there is lodg|ed only a light &s;hadow of Authority; for their Bi&s;hop has the glorious Title of Patriark, as well as the Duke is called their Prince, and his &s;ere|nity, and hath his name &s;tampt upon their Coin, &s;o the Patriark with all his high Title hath real|ly no Authority: For not only St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s Church is intirely exempted from his juri&s;diction, and is immediately &s;ubject to the Duke, but his Authority is in all other things &s;o &s;ubject to the Senate, and &s;o regulated by them, that he hath no more power than they are plea&s;ed to allow him: So that the Senate is as really the &s;upream Governor over all Per&s;ons, and in all Cau&s;es as the Kings of <HI>England</HI> have pretended to be in their own Do|minions &s;ince the Rrformation: But be&s;ides all this, the Clergy of <HI>Venice</HI> have a very extraordinary &s;ort of exemption, and are a &s;ort of a Body like a Presbytery independent of the Bi&s;hop: The Curats are cho&s;en by the Inhabitants of every Pari&s;h, and
<PB N="77" REF="60"> this makes that no Noble <HI>Venetian</HI> is &s;uffered to pretend to any Curacy, for they think it below that Dignity to &s;uffer one of their Body to en|gage in a Competition with one of a lower Order, and to run the hazard of being rejected.</P>
<P>I was told the manner of tho&s;e Elections was the mo&s;t &s;candalous thing po&s;&s;ible, for the &s;everal Can|didates appear on the day of election, and &s;et out their own merits, and defame the other pretenders in the foule&s;t language, and in the mo&s;t &s;currilous manner imaginable; the &s;ecrets of all their lives are publi&s;ht in mo&s;t reproachful terms, and nothing is &s;o abject and ridiculous that is not put in practice on tho&s;e oc|ca&s;ions: There is a &s;ort of an A&s;&s;ociation among the Curats for judging of their common concerns, and &s;ome of the Laity of the &s;everal Pari&s;hes a&s;&s;i&s;t in tho&s;e Courts, &s;o that here is a real <HI>Presbytery.</HI> The great libertinage that is &s;o undecently practi&s;ed by mo&s;t &s;orts of people at <HI>Venice,</HI> extends it &s;elf to the Clergy to &s;uch a degree, that though ignorance and vice &s;eem the only indelible characters that they carry generally over all <HI>Italy,</HI> yet tho&s;e appear here in a much more con&s;picuous manner than el&s;ewhere, and upon tho&s;e popular elections all comes out. The Nuns of <HI>Venice</HI> have been under much &s;candal for a great while; there are &s;ome Mona&s;teries that are as famous for their &s;trictne&s;s and exactne&s;s to their rules, as others are for the liberties they take; chief|ly tho&s;e of St. <HI>Zachary</HI> and St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> where none but Noble <HI>Venetians</HI> are admitted, and where it is not &s;o much as pretended that they have retired for devotion; but it is owned to be done meerly that they might not be too great a charge to their Family: They are not vailed, their neck and brea&s;t is bare, and they receive much company: but that which I &s;aw was in a publick Room, in which there were many grills for &s;everal Parlors, &s;o that the conver&s;a|tion
<PB N="78" REF="61"> is very confu&s;ed, for there being a different com|pany at every grill, and the <HI>Italians</HI> &s;peaking gene|rally very loud, the noi&s;e of &s;o many loud talkers is very di&s;agreeable. The Nuns talk much and very ungracefully, and allow them&s;elves a liberty in rally|ing that other places could not bear. About four years ago the Patriark intended to bring in a reform into tho&s;e Hou&s;es, but the Nuns of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> with whom he began, told him plainly they were Noble <HI>Venetians,</HI> who had cho&s;en that way of life as more convenient for them, but they would not &s;ubject them&s;elves to his regulations, yet he came and would &s;hut up their hou&s;e, &s;o they went to &s;et fire to it; upon which the Senate interpo&s;ed and or|dered the Patriark to de&s;i&s;t. There is no Chri&s;tian State in the World that hath expre&s;&s;ed a jealou&s;ie of Churchmens getting into the publick Councels &s;o much as the <HI>Venetians,</HI> for as a Noble <HI>Venetian</HI> that goes into Orders, loo&s;es thereby his right of going to vote in the great Councel, &s;o when any of them are promoted to be Cardinals, the whole kindred and family mu&s;t during their lives, withdraw from the great Councel, and are al&s;o incapable of all im|ployments: And by a clau&s;e which they added when they received the Inqui&s;ition, which &s;eemed of no great con&s;equence, they have made it to become a Court ab&s;olutely &s;ubject to them; for it being pro|vided that the Inqui&s;itors &s;hould do nothing but in the pre&s;ence of &s;uch as &s;hould be Deputed by the Senate to be the witne&s;&s;es of their proceedings; tho&s;e Deputies either will not come but when they think fit, or will not &s;tay longer than they are plea&s;ed with their proceedings; &s;o that either their ab&s;ence or their withdrawing di&s;&s;olves the Court: for a citati|on cannot be made, a witne&s;s cannot be examined, nor the lea&s;t point of form carried on if the Depu|ties of the Senate are not pre&s;ent: and thus it is,
<PB N="79" REF="61"> that though there is a Court of Inqui&s;ition at <HI>Venice,</HI> yet there is &s;carce any per&s;on brought into trouble by it, and there are many of the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Religion that live there without any trouble; and though there is a Congregation of them there that hath their exerci&s;es of Religion very regularly, yet the Senate gives them no trouble. It is true, the Ho&s;ty's not being carried about in Proce&s;&s;ion, but &s;ecretly by the Prie&s;t to the Sick, makes that this unea&s;ie di&s;cri|mination of <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> and <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> doth not offer it &s;elf here as in other places, for the &s;traitne&s;s of the Streets and the Channels through which one mu&s;t go almo&s;t every foot, makes that this could not be done in <HI>Venice</HI> as it is el&s;ewhere, and from <HI>Venice</HI> this rule is carried over their whole Territory, tho the like rea&s;on doth not hold in the <HI>Terra Firma</HI> The <HI>Venetians</HI> are generally ignorant of the mat|ters of Religion to a &s;candal, and they are as uncon|concerned in them as they are &s;trangers to them, &s;o that all that va&s;t pomp in their Ceremonies and wealth in their Churches is affected rather as a point of magnificence, or a matter of emulation among fa|milies, then that &s;uper&s;tition hath here &s;uch a power over the Spirits of the people as it hath el&s;ewhere: for the Athei&s;m that is received by many here is the dulle&s;t and cur&s;e&s;t thing that can be imagined. The young Nobility are &s;o generally corrupted in their Morals, and &s;o given up to a mo&s;t &s;upine ignorance of all &s;ort of knowledge, that a man cannot ea&s;ily imagine to what a height this is grown, and for Military Courage there is &s;carce &s;o much as the am|bition of being thought brave remaining among the greater part of them.

<PB N="80" REF="62"> think it an extravagant piece of folly for them to go and hazard it when a little money can hire &s;trangers that do it on &s;uch ea&s;ie terms; and thus their Arms are in the hands of &s;trangers, while they &s;tay at home managing their intrigues in the <HI>Broglio,</HI> and di&s;&s;olving their &s;pirits among their Courti&s;ans. And the reputation of their &s;ervice is of late years &s;o much &s;unk, that it is very &s;trange to &s;ee &s;o many come to a &s;ervice &s;o decried, where there is &s;o lit|tle care had of the Souldiers, and &s;o little regard had to the Officers; the arrears are &s;o &s;lowly paid, and the rewards are &s;o &s;cantly di&s;tributed, that if they do not change their maxims they may come to feel this very &s;en&s;ibly; for as their Subjects are not acquainted with Warlike matters, &s;o their. Nobility have no &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t of ambition that way, and &s;trangers are extreamly di&s;gu&s;ted. It is chiefly to the conjecture of affairs that they owe their &s;afety, for the feeblene&s;s of all their Neighbours, the <HI>Turk,</HI> the <HI>Emperour,</HI> the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> the Pope, and the Duke of <HI>Mantua,</HI> pre&s;erves them from the apprehen&s;ion of an Inva&s;ion, and the quarrels, and the degeneracy of their Sub|jects, &s;ave them from the fears of a Revolt, but a formidable Neighbour would put them hard to it. One great occa&s;ion of the degeneracy of the <HI>Italians,</HI> and in particular of the <HI>Venetian</HI> Nobi|lity, is a maxim that hath been taken up for &s;ome con&s;iderable time, that for the pre&s;ervation of their Families, it is fit than only one of a Fa|mily &s;hould marry; to which I will not add that it is generally believed that the Wife is in common to the whole Family: By this means the younger Brothers that have appointments for life, and that have no Families that come from them, are not &s;tirred up by any ambition to &s;ig|nalize them&s;elves or to make Families, and &s;o they give way to all the lazine&s;s of luxury, and are quite enervated by it.</P>
<PB N="81" REF="62">
<P>Whereas the be&s;t &s;ervices done in other States flows from the nece&s;&s;ities as well as the a&s;pirings of younger Brothers or their Families, who&s;e blood qualifies them to pretend, as well as their pride and nece&s;&s;i|ties pu&s;h them on, to acquire fir&s;t a reputation, and then a fortune: But all this is a my&s;tery to the <HI>Ve|netians,</HI> who apprehend &s;o much from the active Spi|rits of a nece&s;&s;itous Nobility, that to lay tho&s;e to &s;leep, they incourage them in all tho&s;e things that may blunt and depre&s;s their minds, and youth nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">|rally hates Letters as much as it loves plea&s;ure, when it is &s;o far from being re&s;trained, that it is rather pu&s;hed on to all the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of unlimited di&s;|orders.</P>
<P>Yet I mu&s;t add one thing, that though <HI>Venice,</HI> is the place in the whole World where plea&s;ure is mo&s;t &s;tudied, and where the youth have both the greate&s;t Wealth, and the mo&s;t lei&s;ure to pur&s;ue it: yet it is the place that I ever &s;aw where true and in|nocent plea&s;ure is the lea&s;t under&s;tood, in which I will make a little digre&s;&s;ion that perhaps will not be unplea&s;ant. As for the plea&s;ures of friend&s;hip or marriage they are &s;trangers to them, for the horri|ble di&s;tru&s;t, in which they all live, of one another, makes that it is very rare to find a friend in <HI>Italy,</HI> but mo&s;t of all in <HI>Venice:</HI> and though we have been told of &s;everal &s;tories of celebrated friend&s;hips there, yet the&s;e are now very rare. As for their Wives they are bred to &s;o much ignorance, they conver&s;e &s;o little, that they know nothing but the dull &s;uper&s;ti|tion on Holy-days in which they &s;tay in the Church|es as long as they can, and &s;o prolong the little li|berty they have of going abroad on tho&s;e days as Children do their hours of play: They are not im|ployed in their dome&s;tick affairs, and generally they under&s;tand no &s;ort of work, &s;o that I was told that they were the in&s;ipide&s;t creatures imaginable; they are, perhaps, as vitious as in other places; but it is
<PB N="82" REF="63"> among them down-right lewdne&s;s, for they are not drawn into it by the intranglements of amour that inveigle and lead many per&s;ons much farther than they imagined or intended at fir&s;t, but in them the fir&s;t &s;tep without any preamble or preparative, is down-right bea&s;tline&s;s. And an <HI>Italian</HI> that knew the World well, &s;aid upon this matter a very lively thing to me, he &s;aid their jealou&s;ie made them re|&s;train their Daughters, and their Wives &s;o much, that they could have none of tho&s;e dome&s;tick enter|tainments of Wit, Conver&s;ation, and Friend&s;hip, that the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have at home: It is true tho&s;e he &s;aid hazard a little the honour of their Fa|milies by that liberty, but the <HI>Italians</HI> by their ex|ce&s;&s;ive caution, made that they had none of the true delights of a Married State; and notwith&s;tanding all their unea&s;ie jealou&s;ie, they were &s;till in danger of a contraband Nobility, therefore he thought they would do much better to hazard a little, when it would produce a certain &s;atisfaction, then to watch &s;o anxiou&s;ly, and thereby have an in&s;ipid companion in&s;tead of a lively Friend, though &s;he might, per|haps, have &s;ome ill moments. As for their hou&s;es they have nothing convenient at <HI>Venice,</HI> for the Ar|chitecture is almo&s;t all the &s;ame, one &s;tair-ca&s;e, a Hall that runs along the body of the hou&s;e, and chambers on both hands, but there are no apart|ments, no Clo&s;ets or Back-&s;tairs; &s;o that in hou&s;es that are of an exce&s;&s;ive wealth, they have yet no &s;ort of convenience; Their Bed&s;teads are of Iron, becau&s;e of the Vermin that their moi&s;ture produces, the bottoms are of boards, upon which they lay &s;o many quilts that it is a huge &s;tep to get up to them, their great Chairs are all upright without a &s;top in the back, hard in the bottom, and the wood of the arms is not covered; they mix water with their wine in their Hog&s;heads, &s;o that for above half the year the wine is either dead or &s;our, they do not leaven
<PB N="83" REF="63"> their Bread, &s;o that it is extream heavy, and the Oven is too much heated, &s;o that the crum is as Dough, when the cru&s;t is hard as a &s;tone, in all Inns they boil Meat fir&s;t before it is roa&s;ted, and thus, as indeed they make it tender, &s;o it is quite ta&s;tle&s;s and in&s;ipid: And as for their Land-carriage all <HI>Lom|bardy</HI> over, it is extream inconvenient, for their Coaches are fa&s;tned to the pearch, which makes them as unea&s;ie as a Cart: It it true, they begin to have at <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Naples,</HI> Coaches that are fa&s;tned to a &s;ort of double pearch, that runs round the bot|tom of the Coach of both &s;ides, which are thin that they ply to the motion of the Coach, and are extream ea&s;ie, but tho&s;e are not known in <HI>Lombardy,</HI> and be&s;ides this, their Cale&s;hes are open, &s;o that one is expo&s;ed to the Sun, and du&s;t in Summer, and to the Weather in Winter: But though they are covered as ours are, on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Ap|penins,</HI> yet I &s;aw none that were covered in <HI>Lom|bardy:</HI> And thus by an enumeration of many of the innocent plea&s;ures, and conveniences of life, it appears that the <HI>Venetians</HI> pur&s;ue &s;o violently for|bidden plea&s;ures, that they know not how to find out that which is allowable. Their con&s;tant pra|ctices in the <HI>Broglio</HI> is their chief bu&s;ine&s;s, where tho&s;e that are nece&s;&s;itous are pur&s;uing for Employ|ments of advantage, and tho&s;e that are full of wealth take a &s;ort of plea&s;ure in cro&s;&s;ing their pretentions, and in embroiling matters. The walk in which the Nobility tread is left to them, for no others dare walk among them, and they change the &s;ide of the &s;quare of St. <HI>Mark</HI> as the Sun, and the Weather di|rects them. Perhaps a derivation that Mr. <HI>Patin</HI> gave me of <HI>Brolio</HI> from the Greek <HI>Peribol&acirc;ion,</HI> a lit|tle corrupted is not forced; and &s;ince they make all their parties, and manage all their intreague in tho&s;e Walks, I am apt to think that broils, bro|villons and imbroilments are derived from the
<PB N="84" REF="64"> agitations that are managed in tho&s;e walks.</P>
<P>As for the la&s;t created Nobility of <HI>Venice,</HI> I came to know &s;ome particulars that I have not yet &s;een in any books, which I &s;uppo&s;e will not be unacceptable to you. It is certain that if the <HI>Venetians</HI> could have fore&s;een at the beginning of the War of <HI>Candy,</HI> the va&s;t expence in which the length of it engaged them, they would have abandoned the I&s;le, rather than have wa&s;ted their Trea&s;ure, and deba&s;ed their Nobility. This la&s;t was extream &s;en&s;ible to them; for as the dignity of the rank they hold is &s;o much the more e|minent as it is re&s;trained to a &s;mall number, &s;o all the be&s;t Imployments and Honours of the State be|longing to this body, the admitting &s;uch a number into it, as mu&s;t ri&s;e out of Seventy Eight Families, was in effect the &s;haring their Inheritance among &s;o many adopted Brothers. This had been le&s;s Infa|mous if they had communicated that Honour only to the ancient Citizens of <HI>Venice,</HI> or to the Nobility of tho&s;e States that they have &s;ubdued in the <HI>Terra firma;</HI> for as there are many Citizens who are as an|cient as the Nobility, only their Ance&s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">s not hap|ning to be of that Council that a&s;&s;umed the Govern|ment about Four Hundred Years ago, they have not been rai&s;ed to that Honour, &s;o there had been no In|famy in creating &s;ome of them to be of the Nobility. It had been al&s;o brought under con&s;ultation long ago, upon the reduction of tho&s;e States in the <HI>Terra firma,</HI> whether it was not advi&s;able according to the maxims of the ancient <HI>Romans</HI> to communicate that dignity to &s;ome of their chief Families, as being the &s;ure&s;t way to give &s;ome contentment to tho&s;e States, it being al|&s;o a real as well as a cheap &s;ecurity, when the chief Families in tho&s;e Cities, were admitted to a Share in all the Honours of the Republick. It is true &s;ome of the Nobility of tho&s;e States thought they had Honour enough by their birth, and &s;o <HI>Zambara</HI> of <HI>Bre&s;cia</HI> re|fu&s;ed to accept an Honour from tho&s;e that had robbed
<PB N="85" REF="64"> his Country of its liberty, yet his po&s;terity are now o another mind, for they came and bought in this la&s;t &s;ale of honour that which was freely offered to their Ance&s;tor, and was rejected by him. When the Se|nate found it &s;elf extreamly pre&s;&s;ed for money during the war it was at fir&s;t propo&s;ed that &s;ome Families, to the number of Five, might be enobled; they of|fering Sixty Thou&s;and Ducats if they were <HI>Venetians,</HI> and Seventy Thou&s;and if they were Strangers: There was but one Per&s;on that oppo&s;ed this in the Senate, &s;o it being pa&s;&s;ed there, was pre&s;ented to the great Coun|cil; and there it was like to have pa&s;&s;ed without any difficulty, but one Per&s;on oppo&s;ed it with &s;o much vigor, that though the Duke de&s;ired him to give o|ver his oppo&s;ition, &s;ince the nece&s;&s;ities of the War required a great &s;upply, yet he per&s;i&s;ted &s;till; and though one of the <HI>Savii</HI> &s;et forth with tears the extre|mities to which the State was reduced, he &s;till in&s;i&s;t|ed and fell upon one conceit that turned the whole Council, he &s;aid they were not &s;ure if Five Per&s;ons could be found that would purcha&s;e that honour at &s;uch a rate, and then it would be a va&s;t di&s;grace, to expo&s;e the offer of Nobility fir&s;t to &s;ale, and then to the affront of finding no buyers when it was of|fered to be &s;old, and by this means he put by the re&s;olution for that time: But then another method was taken that was more honourable, and was of a more extended con&s;equence. <HI>Labia</HI> was the fir&s;t that pre&s;ented a Petition to the great Council, &s;etting forth his merits towards the Republick, and de&s;iring that he might be thought worthy to offer a Hundred Thou&s;and Ducats towards the &s;ervice of the State; this was under&s;tood to be the asking to be made noble at that price. <HI>Delfino</HI> &s;aid he thought every Man might be well judged worthy to offer &s;uch an a&s;&s;i|&s;tance to the Publick, and that &s;uch as brought that &s;upply might expect a &s;uitable acknowledgment from the Senate, who might afterwards of their own ac|cord
<PB N="86" REF="65"> be&s;tow that honour on tho&s;e that expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much zeal for the Publick; and this would be too much deba&s;ed if it were thus bought and &s;old; but it &s;eems the purcha&s;ers had no mind to part with their money, and to leave the reward to the gratitude of the Council, &s;o the Petition was granted in plain terms; and the Nobility &s;o acquired was not only to de&s;cend to the Children of him that was enobled, but to his Brothers and the whole Family to &s;uch a degree. After <HI>Labia</HI> a great many more came with the like Petitions, and it was not unplea&s;ant to &s;ee in what terms Merchants, that came to buy this Ho|nour &s;et forth their merits, which were that they had taken care to furni&s;h the Republick with &s;uch things as were nece&s;&s;ary for its pre&s;ervation. There was a &s;ort of a Triumvirat formed of a <HI>Jew,</HI> a <HI>Greek,</HI> and an <HI>Italian,</HI> who were the Brokers, and found out the Merchants; and at la&s;t brought down the price from a Hundred Thou&s;and to Sixty Thou&s;and Ducats, and no other qualifications were required if they had money enough; For when <HI>Correge</HI> &s;aid to the Duke that he was afraid to ask that honour for want of merit, the Duke asked him if he had a Hun|dred Thou&s;and Ducats, and when the other an&s;wer|ed the Summ was ready, the Duke told him that was a great merit. At la&s;t Seventy Eight purcha&s;ed this honour to the great regret of <HI>Labia;</HI> who &s;aid that if he had imagined that &s;o many would have fol|lowed him in that demand, he would have bid &s;o high for it that it &s;hould have been out of their power to have done it. It is true many of the Purcha&s;ers were Ancient and Noble Families, but many others were not only Merchants, but were of the lowe&s;t &s;ort of them; who as they had inriched them&s;elves by Trade, did then impoveri&s;h them&s;elves by the acqui&s;ition of an honour that as it obliged them to give over their Trade, and put them in a higher way of living, &s;o it hath not brought them
<PB N="87" REF="65"> yet in any advantage to ballance that lo&s;s; for they are &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed, that they are generally ex|cluded when they compete with the ancient Nobi|lity, though this is done with that di&s;cretion, that the old Families do not declare always again&s;t the new, for that would throw the new into a faction gain&s;t them, which might be a great prejudice to them, for the new are much more numerous than the old.</P>
<P>Another great prejudice that the <HI>Republick</HI> feels by this great Promotion, is that the chief Families of the Citizens of <HI>Venice,</HI> who had been long pra|cti&s;ed in the affairs of State, and out of whom the Envoyes, the Secretaries of State, and the Chan|cellour that is the head of the Citizens, as well as the Duke is the head of the Nobility, are to be cho&s;en, having purcha&s;ed the chief Honour of the State there is not now a &s;ufficient number of capable Citizens, left for &s;erving the State in tho&s;e Employments; but this defect will be redre&s;t with the help of a little time. But if this increa&s;e of the Nobility hath le&s;&s;ened the Dignity of the ancient Families, there is a regulation made in this Age that &s;till pre|&s;erves a con&s;iderable di&s;tinction of Authority in their hands. Crimes again&s;t the State, when com|mitted by any of the Nobility, were always judged by the Inqui&s;itors, and the Council of Ten, but all other Crimes were judged by the Council of Forty. But in the Year 1624. one of the Nobles was ac|cu&s;ed of Peculat committed in one of their Govern|ments, and the <HI>Avogadore</HI> in the pleading, as he &s;et forth his Crime, called him a Rogue and a Robber: yet though his crimes were manife&s;t, there being but Six and twenty Judges pre&s;ent, Twelve only condemned him, and Fourteen acquitted him; this gave great offence, for though he was acquitted by his Judges, his Crimes were evident; &s;o that his Fame could not be re&s;tored: for the Depo&s;itions of the Witne&s;&s;es, and the <HI>Avogadores</HI> (or the Attorney
<PB N="88" REF="66"> Generals) Charge were heard by the People; &s;o it was propo&s;ed to make a difference between the Nobility and the other Subjects: and &s;ince all Trials before the Forty were publick, and the Trials be|fore the Ten were in &s;ecret, it &s;eemed fit to remit the Nobility to be tried by the Ten: Some fore&s;aw that this would tend to a Tyranny, and rai&s;e the Dignity of the ancient Families, of whom the Coun|cil of Ten is always compo&s;ed, too high: There|fore they oppo&s;ed it upon this ground, That &s;ince the Council of Forty &s;ent out many Orders to the Governors, it would very much le&s;&s;en their Autho|rity, if they were not to be the Judges of tho&s;e who obliged to receive their Orders: But to qua|lify this Oppo&s;ition, a Provi&s;o was made that re|&s;erved to the Council of Forty, a power to Judge of the Obedience that was given to their Orders, but all other Accu&s;ations of the Nobility were re|mitted to the Council of Ten: and the body of the Nobility were &s;o plea&s;ed with this Di&s;tincti|on that was put between them and the other Sub|jects, that they did not &s;ee that this did really en|&s;lave them &s;o much the more, and brought them under more danger: &s;ince tho&s;e who judge in &s;ecret have a freer &s;cope to their pa&s;&s;ions, than tho&s;e who&s;e proceedings are publick, and &s;o are in ef|fect judged by the Publick, which is often a very effectual re&s;traint upon the Judges them&s;elves. But the Council of Ten being generally in the hands of the great Families: Whereas tho&s;e of all &s;orts are of the Council of Forty, which was the chief Judica|tory of the State, and is much Ancienter than that of Ten: It had been much more wi&s;ely done of them to have been &s;till Judged by the Forty: And if they had thought it for their Honour to have a difference made in the way of judging the Nobility, and the other Subjects, it had been more for their &s;ecurity to have brought their Trials to this, That
<PB N="89" REF="66"> whereas the Forty Judge all other offenders with open doors, the Nobility &s;hould be judged the doors being &s;hut, which is a thing they very much de&s;ire now, but without any hope of ever obtain|ing it: For this power of Judging the Nobility is now con&s;idered as Right of the Ten, and if any Man would go about to change it, the Inqui&s;itors would be perhaps, very quick with him, as a mover of Sedition, and be, in that ca&s;e, both Judge, and Party; Yet the Inqui&s;itors being apprehen&s;ive of the di&s;ta&s;t that this might breed in the body of the Nobility, have made a &s;ort of regulation, though it doth not amount to much; which is, that the Nobility &s;hall be Judged before the Council of Ten for atrocious ca&s;es, &s;uch as matter of State, the robbing the Publick, and other enormous Crimes; but that for all other matters they are to be Judged by the Forty: yet the Council of Ten draws all ca&s;es before them, and none dare di&s;pute with them.</P>
<P>But this leads me to &s;ay a little to you of that part of this Con&s;titution, which is &s;o much cen|&s;ured by &s;trangers: but is really both the greate&s;t glory, and the chief &s;ecurity of this Republick, which is the unlimited power of Inqui&s;itors, that extends not only to the chief of the Nobility, but to the Duke him&s;elf, who is &s;o &s;ubject to them, that they may not only give him &s;evere reprimands, but &s;earch his Papers, make his Proce&s;s, and in con|clu&s;ion, put him to death without being bound to give an account of their Proceedings, except to the Council of Ten. This is the dread not only of all the Subjects, but of the whole Nobility, and of all that bear Office in the Republick, and makes the greate&s;t among them tremble, and &s;o obligeth them to an exact conduct. But though it is not to be denied that upon &s;ome occa&s;ions they may have been a little too &s;udden, particularly in the known &s;tory of <HI>Fo&s;carini,</HI> yet &s;uch unju&s;tifiable
<PB N="90" REF="67"> &s;everities have occurred &s;o &s;eldom, that as the wi&s;|dom of this Body in making and pre&s;erving &s;uch an In&s;titution, cannot be enough admired, &s;o the dex|trous conduct of tho&s;e who mannage this va&s;t tru&s;t, &s;o as not to force the Body to take it out of their hands, is likewi&s;e highly to be wondered at. In &s;hort, the in&s;olence, the factions, the revenges, the nece&s;&s;ities and ambition that mu&s;t needs po&s;&s;e&s;s a great many Members of &s;o va&s;t a Body as is the No|bility of <HI>Venice,</HI> mu&s;t have thrown them often into many fatal Convul&s;ions, if it were not for the dread in which they all &s;tand of this Court: which hath &s;o many &s;pies abroad, chiefly among the <HI>Gon|daliers,</HI> who cannot fail to di&s;cover all the &s;e|cret Commerce of <HI>Venice,</HI> be&s;ides the &s;ecret ad|vices that are thrown in at &s;o many of tho&s;e Ly|ons mouths that are in &s;everal places of St. <HI>Mark</HI>'s Palace, within which there are boxes that are under the Keys of the Inqui&s;itors, &s;o that it is &s;carce po&s;|&s;ible for a Man to be long in any de&s;ign again&s;t the State, and not to be di&s;covered by them. And when they find any in fault, they are &s;o inexorable, and &s;o quick, as well as &s;evere in their Ju&s;tice, that the very fear of this is &s;o effectual a re&s;traint, that perhaps the long pre&s;ervation of <HI>Venice,</HI> and of its Liberty, is owing to this &s;ingle piece of their con&s;ti|tution: and the Inqui&s;itors are Per&s;ons generally &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed for their merit who mu&s;t be all of dif|ferent Families; and their Authority la&s;ts &s;o &s;hort a while, that the advantages of this va&s;t Authority that is lodged with them, are con&s;tant and vi&s;ible; whereas the unhappy in&s;tances of their being impo&s;ed on, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> carrying their &s;u&s;picions too far, are &s;o few, that whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> ever the Nobility grows weary of his yoke, and throw it off, one may reckon the Glory and Pro&s;perity of <HI>Ve|nice</HI> at an end.

But upon the fir&s;t occa&s;ion that offered it &s;elf after that, to quar|rel with the proceeding of the Inqui&s;itors, they laid hold on it, and aggravated the matter extreamly, and moved for the limiting of their Authority, but the Great Council was wi&s;er than to touch &s;o &s;acred a part of the Government, &s;o they retained their power very entire, but they manage it with all po&s;|&s;ible caution; A Forreigner that hath been many years in their Service, told me that the Stories with which &s;trangers were frighted at the Arbitrary pow|er that was re&s;ted in tho&s;e Inqui&s;itors were &s;light things, in compari&s;on of the advantages that they found from it: And after Eleven Years &s;pent in their &s;ervice, he &s;aid, he never was &s;o much as once &s;ent for to receive a reprimand from them. And if the Nobility, that have any Commerce with &s;trangers, confe&s;s it &s;incerely to the Inqui&s;itors, they are in dan|ger by it; by if they conceal it, or any main cir|cum&s;tances of it, their Proce&s;s will be &s;oon di&s;patch|ed.

<PB N="92" REF="68"> the particulars of the Sale of Nobility that is now on foot &s;ince this la&s;t War with the <HI>Turks,</HI> which hath made them willing to take up once a|gain this ea&s;ie way of rai&s;ing of Money: Nor could I give credit to that of which a Per&s;on of great E|minence there a&s;&s;ured me, that there was a poy|&s;oner general in <HI>Venice,</HI> that had a Salary, and was employed by the Inqui&s;itors to di&s;patch tho&s;e a|gain&s;t whom a publick proceeding would make too great a noi&s;e; this I could not believe, though my Author prote&s;ted, that the Brother of one that was &s;olicited to accept of the Employment, di&s;cove|red it to him. There is no place in the World where &s;trangers live with more freedom and I was amazed to &s;ee &s;o little exactne&s;s among the Searchers of the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e; for though we had a Mullets load of Trunks and Portmantles, yet none offered to ask us, either coming or going, what we were, or what we carried with us. But the be&s;t and Noble&s;t Enter|tainment that <HI>Venice</HI> afforded while I was there, was the company of Mr. <HI>dela Haye</HI> the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;|&s;adour, who as he hath &s;pent his whole life in pub|lick Emba&s;&s;ies, &s;o he hath acquired &s;o great a know|ledge of the World, with &s;o true a Judgment, and &s;o obliging a civility, that he may well pa&s;s for a Pat|tern; and it is no wonder to &s;ee him &s;till engaged in a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of publick Employments; and his Lady is &s;o wonderful a Per&s;on, that I pay them both but a very &s;mall part of what I owe them, in this acknowledgement, which I judge my &s;elf bound to make of their extraordinary civilities to me: and indeed without the advantage of &s;uch a rendezvous as I had there, a fortnights &s;tay at <HI>Ve|nice</HI> had been a very tedious matter: From <HI>Venice</HI> we went again to <HI>Padua;</HI> From thence to <HI>Rovigo,</HI> which is but a &s;mall Town, and &s;o to the <HI>Po,</HI> which divides the Territory of the <HI>Republick,</HI> from the <HI>Ferrare&s;e,</HI> which is now the <HI>Popes</HI> Country, and
<PB N="93" REF="68"> here one &s;ees what a difference a good and a bad Government makes in a Countrey; for though the Soil is the &s;ame on both &s;ides of the River, and the <HI>Ferrare&s;e</HI> was once one of the beautifulle&s;t &s;pots of all <HI>Italy,</HI> as <HI>Ferrara</HI> was one of its be&s;t Towns, while they had Princes of their own, who for a cour&s;e of &s;ome Ages were Princes of &s;uch Eminent virtue, and of &s;o Heroical a Noblene&s;s, that they were really the Fathers of their Country, nothing can be ima|gined more changed than all this is now. The Soil is abandoned, and uncultivated, nor were there hands enough &s;o much as to mow their Gra&s;s, which we &s;aw withering in their Meadows to our no &s;mall wonder. We were amazed to &s;ee &s;o rich a Soil thus for&s;aken of its Inhabitants, and much more when we pa&s;&s;ed through that va&s;t Town, which by its extent &s;hews what it was about an Age ago, and is now &s;o much de&s;erted, that there are whole &s;ides of Streets without Inhabitants, and the poverty of the place appears &s;ignally in the Churches, which are mean and poorly adorned, for the &s;uper&s;tition of <HI>Italy</HI> is &s;o ravenous, and makes &s;uch progre&s;s in this Age, that one may ju&s;tly take the mea&s;ures of the Wealth of any place from the Churches. The Super&s;tition or Vanity of this Age, is &s;o much be|yond that of the pa&s;t, though the contrary to this is commonly believed, that all the va&s;t buildings of great Churches or rich Convents, and the &s;ur|prizing Wealth that appears in them on Fe&s;tival days are the donatives of the pre&s;ent Age; &s;o that it is a vulgar error that &s;ome have taken up, who fancy that Super&s;tition is at a &s;tand, if not in a decay, unle&s;s it be acknowledged that the craft of the Prie&s;ts hath opened to them a new method to &s;upport their riches, when the old ones of Purga|tory, and Indulgences were become le&s;s effectual in an Age of more knowledge, and better enlightned, and that is to engage Men to an emulation and a
<PB N="94" REF="69"> vanity in enriching their Churches, as much as o|ther <HI>Italians</HI> have in the inriching ther Palaces, &s;o that as they have a plea&s;ure as well as a vanity in &s;eeing &s;o much dead Wealth in their hou&s;es, they have tran&s;lated the &s;ame humour to their Churches: And the vanity of the pre&s;ent Age that believes little or nothing of tho&s;e contrivances, of Purga|tory, or the like, produceth the &s;ame, if not grea|ter effects, in the building and inriching their Churches, and &s;o carries it in expence and prodi|gality from the Super&s;tition of the former Ages that believed every thing. But to return to <HI>Ferra|ra,</HI> I could not but ask all I &s;aw, how it came, that &s;o rich a Soil was &s;o &s;trangely abandoned, &s;ome &s;aid the Air was become &s;o unhealthy, that tho&s;e who &s;tay in it were very &s;hort lived; but it is well known that Four&s;core Years ago it was well peopled; and the ill Air is occa&s;ioned by the want of Inhabitants; for there not being people to drain the ground and to keep the Ditches clean, this makes that there is a great deal of Water that lies on the ground and rots, which infects the Air in the &s;ame manner as is ob&s;erved in that va&s;t and rich, but un|inhabited Champaign of <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;o that the ill Air is the effect rather than the cau&s;e of the di&s;peopling of the <HI>Popes</HI> Dominions. The true cau&s;e is the &s;e|verity of the Government, and the heavy Taxes, and frequent Confi&s;cations, by which the Nephews of &s;everal <HI>Popes,</HI> as they have devoured many of the Families of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> &s;o they have driven away many more. And this appears more vi&s;ibly by the different &s;tate, as well as the Con&s;titution of <HI>Bologna,</HI> which is full of People that abound in Wealth, and as the Soil is extream rich, &s;o it is cultivated with all due care. For <HI>Bologna</HI> delivered it &s;elf to the Popedom upon a capitulation, by which there are many Priviledges re&s;erved to it: Crimes there are only puni&s;hed in the Per&s;ons of
<PB N="95" REF="69"> tho&s;e who commit them, but there are no confi&s;|cations of E&s;tates; and though the Authority, in Criminal matters, belongs to the <HI>Pope,</HI> and is man|aged by a Legate and his Officers, yet the Civil Government, the Magi&s;tracy, and the power of Ju|dicature in Civil matters, is entirely in the hands of the State: And by this regulation it is, that as the riches of <HI>Bologna</HI> amaze a &s;tranger, it neither being on a Navigable River, by which it is not capable of much Trade, nor being the Center of a Sove|raignty where a Court is kept; &s;o the Taxes that the <HI>Popes</HI> fetch from thence, are &s;o con&s;iderable, that he draws much more from this place of Li|berty, than from tho&s;e where his Authority is un|limited and ab&s;olute, but that are by tho&s;e means al|mo&s;t quite abandoned; for the greatne&s;s of a Prince or State ri&s;ing from the numbers of the Subjects, tho&s;e maxims that retain the Subjects, and that draw &s;trang|ers to come among them, are certainly the true&s;t max|ims for advancing the greatne&s;s of the Ma&s;ter. And I could not but with much &s;corn, ob&s;erve the folly of &s;ome <HI>Frenchmen,</HI> who made u&s;e of this argument to &s;hew the greatne&s;s of their Nation, that one found many <HI>Frenchmen</HI> in all places to which one could come, whereas there were no <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> nor <HI>Dutch,</HI> nor <HI>Swit|zers,</HI> and very few <HI>Germans:</HI> But is ju&s;t contrary to the right con&s;equence that ought to be drawn from this ob&s;ervation. It is certain, that few leave their Country, and go to &s;ettle el&s;ewhere, if they are not pre&s;&s;ed with &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s at home that they cannot well live among their Friends and Kin|red; &s;o that a mild Government drives out no &s;warms: Whereas it is the &s;ure mark of a &s;evere Government that weakens it &s;elf, when many of the Subjects find it &s;o hard to &s;ub&s;i&s;t at home, that they are forced to &s;eek that abroad, which they would much rather do in their own Country, if Impo&s;itions, and o|ther &s;everities did not force them to change their ha|bitations.</P>

<P>But to return to the wealth of <HI>Bologna,</HI> it appears in every corner of the Town, and all round it; though its &s;cituation is not very favourable, for it lies at the foot of the <HI>Appenins</HI> on the <HI>North-&s;ide,</HI> and is extream cold in Winter. The hou&s;es are built as at <HI>Padua</HI> and <HI>Bern,</HI> &s;o that one walks all the Town over covered under <HI>Piazza</HI>'s; but the walks here are both higher and larger than any where el&s;e, there are many Noble Palaces all over the Town, and the Churches, and Convents are incredibly rich; within the Town the riche&s;t are the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> which is the chief hou&s;e of the Order, where their Founders bo|dy is laid in one of the be&s;t Chapels of <HI>Italy;</HI> and next to them are the <HI>Franci&s;cans,</HI> the <HI>Servites,</HI> the <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI> and the Canons Regular of St. <HI>Salvator.</HI> In this la&s;t there is a &s;crowl of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Bible, which though it is not the tenth part of the Bible, they fancy to be the whole Bible; and they were made believe by &s;ome <HI>Jew,</HI> that hath no doubt &s;old it at a high rate, that it was written by <HI>Ezrah</HI>'s own hand, and this hath pa&s;t long for current; but the Manu&s;cript is only a fine Copy like tho&s;e that the <HI>Jews</HI> u&s;e in their Synagogues, that may be, perhaps, Three or Four Hundred Years old; that part of it on which I ca&s;t my eye was the book of <HI>E&s;ther,</HI> &s;o by the bulk of the &s;crowl, I judged it to be the col|lection of tho&s;e &s;mall books of the Old Te&s;tament that the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;et after the Law; but tho&s;e of the hou&s;e fancy they have a great trea&s;ure in it, and per|haps &s;uch <HI>Jews</HI> as have &s;een it are willing to laugh at their ignorance, and &s;o &s;uffer them to go on in their error. The chief Church in the Town is St. <HI>Petrone</HI>'s, and there one &s;ees the curious and exact <HI>Meridional-line,</HI> which that rare A&s;tronomer <HI>Ca&s;&s;ini</HI> laid along a great part of the pavement in a bra&s;s Circle; it marks the true point of midday from <HI>June</HI> to <HI>January,</HI> and is one of the be&s;t performances that perhaps the World ever &s;aw. In the great &s;quare
<PB N="97" REF="70"> before the Church, on the one &s;ide of which is the Legates Palace, among other Statues one &s;urprized me much, it was Pope <HI>Joans,</HI> which is &s;o named by the People of the Town, it is true the Learned Men &s;ay it is the Statue of Pope <HI>Nicolas</HI> the IV. who had indeed a youthly and womani&s;h face. But as I look|ed at this Statue very attentively, through a little pro&s;pect that I carried with me, it appeared plainly to have the face of a young Woman, and was very unlike that of Pope <HI>Nicolas</HI> the IV. which is in St. <HI>Maria Maggiore</HI> at <HI>Rome:</HI> For the Statue of that Pope, though it hath no beard, yet hath an age in it that is very much different from the Statue at <HI>Bologna.</HI> I do not build any thing on this Statue, for I do not believe that Story at all, and I my &s;elf &s;aw in <HI>En|gland</HI> a Manu&s;cript of <HI>Martinus Polonus,</HI> who is one of the ancient Authors of this matter, which did not &s;eem to be written long after the Author's time; In it this Story is not in the Text, but is added on the margin by another hand. On the Hill above <HI>Bolo|gna</HI> &s;tands the Mona&s;tery of St. <HI>Michael in Bo&s;co,</HI> which hath a mo&s;t charming &s;cituation, and pro&s;pect, and is one of the be&s;t Mona&s;teries in <HI>Italy;</HI> it hath many Courts, and one that is Cloi&s;tered, and is <HI>Octangu|lar;</HI> which is &s;o nobly painted <HI>in Fre&s;co,</HI> that it is great pity to &s;ee &s;uch work expo&s;ed to the Air: All was retouched by the famous <HI>Guido Reni,</HI> yet it is now again much decayed: The <HI>Dormitory</HI> is very Ma|gnificent; the Chappel is little but very fine, and the Stalls are richly carved. On the other-&s;ide of <HI>Bo|logna,</HI> in the Bottom, the <HI>Carthu&s;ians</HI> have al&s;o a ve|ry rich Mona&s;tery: Four miles from <HI>Bologna</HI> there is a <HI>Madona</HI> of St. <HI>Lukes,</HI> and becau&s;e many go thither in great devotion, there is a <HI>portico</HI> a building, which is already carried on almo&s;t half way; it is walled towards the <HI>North,</HI> but &s;tands on Pillars to the <HI>South,</HI> and is about Twelve Foot broad, and Fifteen Foot high, which is carried on very vigorou&s;ly, for in Eight
<PB N="98" REF="71"> or Ten Years the half is built, &s;o that in a little time, the whole will be very probably fini&s;hed, and this may prove the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ginning of many &s;uch like <HI>Portico</HI>'s in <HI>Ita|ly,</HI> for things of this kind want only a beginning, and when they are once &s;et on foot they do quickly &s;pread them&s;elves in a Country that is &s;o intirely &s;ubdued by &s;uper&s;tition and the artifices of their Prie&s;ts. In <HI>Bo|logna</HI> they reckon there are Seventy Thou&s;and Per&s;ons. I &s;aw not one of the chief glories of this place for the famous <HI>Malapighi</HI> was out of Town while I was there. I &s;aw a Play there, but the Poe&s;ie was &s;o bad, the Farces &s;o rude, and all was &s;o ill acted, that I was not a little amazed to &s;ee the Company expre&s;s &s;o great a &s;atisfaction in that which would have been hi&s;s'd off the Stage either in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>France.</HI> From <HI>Bologna</HI> we go Eight miles in a Plain, and then we engage into that range of Hills that carry the name of <HI>Apenins,</HI> though that is &s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ctly given only to one that is the highe&s;t: All the way to <HI>Florence</HI> this track of Hills continues, though there are &s;everal bottoms, and &s;ome con&s;iderable little Towns in them, but all is up-hill and down-hill, and <HI>Florence</HI> it &s;elf is ju&s;t at the bot|tom of the la&s;t Hill. The high-ways all along the&s;e Hills are kept in &s;o very good ca&s;e, that in few of the be&s;t Inhabited Countries doth one find the high-ways &s;o well maintained as in tho&s;e for&s;aken Mountains; but this is &s;o great a pa&s;&s;age that all that are con|cerned in it find their account in the expence they lay out upon it. On the la&s;t of the&s;e Hills, though in a little bottom, in the mid&s;t of a Hill, &s;tands <HI>Pratolino,</HI> one of the great Dukes Palaces, where the retreat in &s;ummer mu&s;t be very agreeable, for the Air of tho&s;e Mountains is extream thin and pure. The Gardens in <HI>Italy</HI> are made at a great co&s;t, the Statues and Foun|tains are very rich and noble, the Grounds are well laid out, and the Walks are long and even: But as they have no Gravel to give them tho&s;e firm and beau|tiful walks that we have in <HI>England,</HI> &s;o the con&s;tant
<PB N="99" REF="71"> greenne&s;s of the Box doth &s;o much plea&s;e them, that they preferring the &s;ight to the &s;mell, have their Gar|dens &s;o high &s;ented by plots made within them, that there is no plea&s;ure to walk in them; they al&s;o lay their walks &s;o between hedges, that one is much con|fined in them. I &s;aw fir&s;t in a Garden at <HI>Vincenza,</HI> that which I found afterwards in many Gardens in <HI>Italy,</HI> which was extream convenient, there went a cour&s;e of Water round about the Walls, about a foot from the ground in a channel of &s;tone that went along the &s;ide of the Wall; and in this there were-holes &s;o made, that a pipe of white Iron or Wood put to them, conveyed the Water to &s;uch plants, as in dry &s;ea&s;on, needed watering; and a cock, &s;et the Water a running in this cour&s;e, &s;o that without the trouble of carrying Water, one Per&s;on could ea&s;ily manage the watring of a great Garden. <HI>Florence</HI> is a beautiful and noble Town, full of great Palaces, rich Churches, and &s;tately Convents. The &s;treets are pav|ed in imitation of the old <HI>Roman</HI> highways, with great Stone bigger than our common pavement Stone, but much thicker, which are &s;o hollowed in their joinings to one another, that hor&s;es find fa&s;tning e|nough to their feet: There are many Statues and Foun|tains in the &s;treets, &s;o that in every corner one meets with many agreeable objects. I will not entertain you with a de&s;cription of the great Dukes Palace and Gardens, or of the old Palace and the Gallery that joins to it, and of the va&s;t Collection of Pictures, Statues, Cabinets, and other curio&s;ities that mu&s;t needs amaze every one that &s;ees them; the Plate, and in particular the Gold Plate, and the great Coach, are all &s;uch extraordinary things that they would require a very copious de&s;cription; if that had not been done &s;o often, that it were to very little purpo&s;e to Copy what others have &s;aid; and the&s;e things are &s;o exactly &s;een by every traveller, that I can &s;ay nothing that is more particular of the&s;e &s;ubjects then you will find
<PB N="100" REF="72"> in the common Itineraries of all Travellers. The great Dome is a magnificent building, but the Fron|ti&s;piece to the great Gate is not yet made. The <HI>Cupulo,</HI> is after S. <HI>Peters,</HI> the greate&s;t and highe&s;t that I &s;aw in <HI>Italy;</HI> it is Three Hundred foot high, and of a va&s;t compa&s;s, and the whole Architecture of this Fabrick is very &s;ingular as well as regular. Only that which was intended to add to its beauty, le&s;&s;ned it very much in my thoughts; for the Walls that are all of Marble being of white and black Marble laid in different figures and orders, looked too like a li|very, and had not that air of noblene&s;s which in my opinion becomes &s;o glorious a Fabrick. The <HI>Bapti|&s;tery</HI> that &s;tands before it was a Noble <HI>Heathen</HI> Tem|ple; its Gates of bra&s;s are the be&s;t of that &s;ort that are in the World: There are &s;o many Hi&s;tories &s;o well repre&s;ented in <HI>bas reliefs</HI> in them, with &s;o much exactne&s;s, the work is &s;o natural and yet &s;o fine, that a curious Man could find entertainment for ma|ny days, if he would examine the three Gates of this Temple, with a critical exactne&s;s. The <HI>Annunciata,</HI> S. <HI>Marks,</HI> S. <HI>Croce,</HI> and S. <HI>Maria Novella,</HI> are Church|es of great beauty and va&s;t riches; but the Church and Chappel of S. <HI>Laurence</HI> exceeds them all as much in the riches within, as it is inferior to them in the out-&s;ide which is quite flea'd, if I may &s;o &s;peak, but on de&s;ign to give it a rich out-&s;ide of Marble. In a Chappel within this Church, the Bodies of the great Dukes lie depo&s;ited, till the famous Chappel is fi|ni&s;hed. But I was much &s;candalized to &s;ee Statues with nudities here, which I do not remember to have &s;een any where el&s;e in Churches. I will not offer at a de&s;cription of the Glorious Chappel, which as it is without doubt the riche&s;t piece of building that perhaps the World ever &s;aw, &s;o it goes on &s;o &s;low|ly, that though there are always many at work, yet it doth not &s;eem to advance proportionably to the number of the hands that are imployed in it. A|mong
<PB N="101" REF="72"> the Statues that are to be in it, there is one of the <HI>Virgins</HI> made by <HI>Michael Angelo,</HI> which repre&s;ents her grief at the Pa&s;&s;ion of her Ble&s;&s;ed Son, that hath the mo&s;t life in it of all the Statues I ever &s;aw.</P>
<P>But the famous Library that belongs to this Con|vent, took up more of my time than all the other Cu|rio&s;ities of <HI>Florence;</HI> for here is a collection of many Manu&s;cripts, mo&s;t of them are <HI>Greek,</HI> that were ga|thered together by Pope <HI>Clement</HI> the VII. and given to his Country: There are very few Printed Books mixed with them; and tho&s;e Books that are there, are &s;o rare, that they are almo&s;t as curious as Manu|&s;cripts. I &s;aw &s;ome of <HI>Virgils</HI> Poems in old Capitals. There is a Manu&s;cript in which &s;ome parts both of <HI>Tacitus</HI> and <HI>Apeuleius</HI> are written, and in one place, one in a different hand hath writ, that he had com|pared tho&s;e Manu&s;cripts: and he adds a date to this in <HI>Olibrius</HI>'s time, which is above Twelve hundred Years ago. I found &s;ome Dipthongs in it ca&s;t into one Letter, which &s;urprized me, for I thought that way of writing of them had not been &s;o ancient: but that which plea&s;ed me mo&s;t, was, that the Library-keeper a&s;&s;ured me, that one had lately found the fa|mous Epi&s;tle of St. <HI>Chri&s;o&s;tomes</HI> to <HI>Ce&s;arius</HI> in <HI>Greek,</HI> in the end of a Volume full of other things, and not among the Manu&s;cripts of that Fathers Books of which they have a great many. He thought he re|membred well the place where the Book &s;tood; &s;o we turned over all the Books that &s;tood near it, but I found it not: He promi&s;ed to look it out for me, if I came back that way. But I changing my de&s;ign, and going back another way, could not &s;ee the bottom of this. It is true, the Famous <HI>Magliabecchi,</HI> who is the Great Dukes Library-keeper, and is a Per&s;on of mo&s;t wonderful civility and full of candour, as well as he is learned beyond imagination, a&s;&s;ured me that this could be no other than a mi&s;take of the Library-keep|ers; he &s;aid &s;uch a di&s;covery could not have been
<PB N="102" REF="73"> made without making &s;o much noi&s;e that he mu&s;t have heard of it. He added there was not one Man in <HI>Florence</HI> that either under&s;tood <HI>Greek,</HI> or that exa|mined Manu&s;cripts, &s;o that he a&s;&s;ured me I could not build on what an Ignorant Library-keeper had told me: So I &s;et down this matter as I found it without building much on it. <HI>Florence</HI> is much &s;unk from what it was, for they do not reckon that there are a|bove Fifty thou&s;and Souls in it: and the other States that were once great Republicks, &s;uch as <HI>Siena</HI> and <HI>Pi&s;a,</HI> while they retained their liberty, are now &s;hrunk almo&s;t into nothing: It is certain that all three together are now not &s;o numerous, as any one of them was Two hundred Years ago. <HI>Legorn</HI> is full of People; and all round <HI>Florence</HI> there are a great many Villages; but as one goes over <HI>Tu&s;cany</HI> it ap|pears &s;o di&s;peopled, that one cannot wonder to find a Country that hath been a Scene of &s;o much action and &s;o many Wars, now &s;o for&s;aken and &s;o poor, and that in many places the Soil is quite neglected for want of hands to cultivate it: and in other places where there are more People, they look &s;o poor, and their hou&s;es are &s;uch mi&s;erable ruines, that it is &s;carce ac|countable how there &s;hould be &s;o much poverty in &s;o rich a Country, which is all over full of beggars: and here the &s;tyle of begging was a little altered from what I found in <HI>Lombardy;</HI> for whereas there they begged for the &s;ake of S. <HI>Anthony,</HI> here all begged for the Souls that were in Purgatory, and this was the &s;tile in all the other parts of <HI>Italy</HI> through which I pa&s;&s;ed.

Be&s;ides this, the va&s;t Wealth of the Convents, where the only People of <HI>Italy</HI> are to be &s;ound, that live not only at their ea&s;e, but in great plenty and luxury, makes many for&s;ake all &s;ort of In|du&s;try, and &s;eek for a retreation of tho&s;e &s;eats of plea&s;ure; &s;o that the People do not encrea&s;e fa&s;t e|nough to make a new Race to come in&s;tead of tho&s;e whom a hard Government drives away.

<P>I <HI>Am now in my la&s;t &s;tage of my Voyage over</HI> Italy, <HI>for &s;ince my la&s;t from</HI> Florence, <HI>I have not only got hither, but have been in</HI> Naples; <HI>and have now &s;atisfied my Curio&s;ity &s;o fully, that I in|tend to leave this Place within a day or two, and go to</HI> Civita-vecchia, <HI>and from thence by Sea to</HI> Mar&s;eilles, <HI>and to avoid an unplea&s;ant Winters Journey over the</HI> Alps. <HI>It is true I clo&s;e the &s;ight of</HI> Turin, Genoa, <HI>and &s;ome other Courts: but tho I am told the&s;e de&s;erve well the pains of the Journey; yet when one ri&s;es from a great Meal, no Delicacies, how much &s;oever they might tempt him at an other time can provoke his appe|tite: &s;o I confe&s;s freely that the &s;ight of</HI> Naples <HI>and</HI> Rome, <HI>have &s;o fil'd my &s;tomack that way, that the Curio&s;ity of &s;eeing new Places is now very low with me, and indeed the&s;e that I have of la&s;t &s;een are &s;uch, that Places which at an other time would plea&s;e me much, would now make but a &s;light and cold Im|pre&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>All the way from <HI>Florence,</HI> through the Great Duke's Country looked &s;o &s;ad, that I concluded it
<PB N="2" REF="75"> mu&s;t be the mo&s;t di&s;peopled of all <HI>Italy:</HI> but indeed, I changed my Note, when I came into the <HI>Popes</HI> Terriories at <HI>Pont Centino,</HI> where there was a rich bottom all uncultivated, and not &s;o much as &s;tocked with Cattle: But as I pa&s;&s;ed from M. <HI>Fia&s;cone</HI> to <HI>Viterbo,</HI> this appeared yet more amazing, for a va&s;t Champion Country lay almo&s;t quite de&s;erted. And that wide Town which is of &s;o great a compa&s;s, hath yet &s;o few Inhabitants, and tho&s;e look &s;o poor and mi&s;erable, that the people in the Ordinary Towns in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in its wor&s;t places make a better appearance. When I was within a days Journey of <HI>Rome,</HI> I fancied that the Neighbourhood of &s;o great a City mu&s;t mend the matt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">t: but I was much di&s;appointed, for a &s;oil that was &s;o Rich, and lay &s;o &s;weetly, that it far exceeded any thing I ever &s;aw out of <HI>Italy,</HI> had neither Inhabitants in it, nor Cattle upon it, to the tenth part of what it could b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ar: The &s;urprize that this gave me, encrea&s;ed upon me as I went out of <HI>Rome</HI> on its other &s;ide, chiefly all the way to <HI>Naples,</HI> and on the way to <HI>Civita-vecchia,</HI> for that va&s;t and rich Champion Countrey that runs all along to <HI>Terracina,</HI> which from <HI>Civi|ta-vecchia</HI> is above a hundred miles long, and is in many places twelve or twenty miles broad, is aban|doned to &s;uch a degree, that as far as ones eye can carry one, there is often not &s;o much as a Hou&s;e to be &s;een; but on the Hills that are on the North-&s;ide of this Valley, and by this di&s;peopling of the Country, the Air is now become &s;o unwhole&s;ome, that it is not &s;afe to be a night in it all the Summer long, for the Water that lies upon many places not being drained, it rots: and in the Summer this produces &s;o many noi&s;om &s;teams, that it is felt even in <HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elf; and if it were not for the bree&s;es that come from the Mountains, the Air would be intollerable: When one &s;ees all this large but va&s;t Countrey from the Hill of <HI>Marino</HI> twelve miles beyond <HI>Rome,</HI> he cannot
<PB N="3" REF="75"> wonder enough at it. In a word, it is the rigour of the Governm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nt, that hath driven away the Inhabi|tants, and their being driven away, hath now re|duced it to &s;uch a pa&s;s, that it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to people it: for &s;uch as would come to drain and cultivate it, mu&s;t run a great hazard, and few can re&s;olve on that, when they can hope for no other reward of their Indu&s;try, but an unea&s;ie Government. It is the greate&s;t &s;olaeci&s;m in Government for the Prince to be Elective, and yet Ab&s;olute; for an He|reditary Prince is induced to con&s;ider his po&s;terity, and to maintain his people, &s;o that tho&s;e that come after him may &s;till &s;upport the rank which they hold in the World: But an Elective Prince hath nothing of that in his eye, unle&s;s he hath a pitch of genero&s;ity which is not ordinary among men, and lea&s;t of all among <HI>Italians,</HI> who have a pa&s;&s;ion for their Fami|lies, which is not known in other places: and thus a <HI>Pope,</HI> who comes in late to this dignity, which by con&s;equence he cannot hope to hold long, doth very naturally turn to tho&s;e Councels, by which his Family may make all the Hay they can during this Sun-&s;hine: And tho anciently the <HI>Cardinals</HI> were a check upon the <HI>Pope,</HI> and a &s;ort of Councel without whom he could do nothing even in Temporals; yet now they have quite lo&s;t that; and they have no other &s;hare in affairs than that to which the <HI>Pope</HI> thinks fit to admit them, &s;o that he is the mo&s;t ab&s;olute Prince in <HI>Europe.</HI> It is true as to Spirituals they retain &s;till a large &s;hare, &s;o that in cen&s;ures and definitions, the <HI>Pope</HI> can do nothing regularly, without their con|currence; tho it is certain that they have not &s;o good a Title to pretend to that, as to &s;hare in the Temporal Principality. For if the <HI>Pope</HI> drives any thing from St. <HI>Peter,</HI> all that, is &s;ingly in him&s;elf, and it is free to him to pr ceed by what method he thinks be&s;t; &s;ince the Infallibility, according to their preten&s;ions, re&s;ts &s;ingly in him: Yet becau&s;e there was not &s;o
<PB N="4" REF="76"> much to be got by acting Arbitrarily in tho&s;e matters, and a Summary way of exerci&s;ing this Authority, might have tempted the World to have enquired too much into the grounds on which it is built; There|fore the <HI>Popes</HI> have let the <HI>Cardinals</HI> retain &s;till a &s;hare in this Supremacy over the Church, tho they have no claim to it, neither by any Divine nor Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical warrants: But as for the endowments of the See of <HI>Rome,</HI> to which they may ju&s;tly lay claim, as being in a manner the Chapter of that See; there is &s;o much to be got by this, that the <HI>Popes</HI> have en|gro&s;&s;ed it wholly to them&s;elves: and thus it is that the Government of this Principality, is very un&s;teady. Sometimes the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Family are extreamly glorious, and magnificent, at other times, they think of no|thing but of e&s;tabli&s;hing their hou&s;e: Sometimes the <HI>Pope</HI> is a man of &s;en&s;e him&s;elf; Sometimes he is quite &s;unk, and as the la&s;t <HI>Pope</HI> was, he become a Child again through old age: Sometimes he hath a parti|cular &s;tifne&s;s of temper, with a great &s;lowne&s;s of under&s;tanding, and an infatiable de&s;ire of heaping up wealth, which is the character of him that now Reigns. By this diver&s;ity which appears eminently in every new Pontificate that commonly avoids tho&s;e exc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;es that made the former Reign odious, the Councels of the <HI>Popedome</HI> are weak and disjointed. But if this is &s;en&s;ible to all <HI>Europe,</HI> with relation to the general concerns of that Body, it is much more vi&s;ible in the Principality it &s;elf, that is &s;ubject to &s;o variable a head. There hath been in this Age a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of four ravenous Reigns, and tho there was a &s;hort interruption in the Reign of the <HI>Ro&s;pi|glio&s;i,</HI> that coming after the <HI>Barberins,</HI> the <HI>Pamphili,</HI> and the <HI>Ghigi</HI>'s, did inrich it &s;elf: and yet it di&s;or|dered the Revenue by the va&s;t magnificence in which he Reigned, more in twenty nine months time, than any other had done in &s;o many years. The <HI>Altieri</HI> did, in a mo&s;t &s;candalous manner, rai&s;e them&s;elves
<PB N="5" REF="76"> in a very &s;hort and di&s;pi&s;ed Reign, and built one of the Noble&s;t Palaces in <HI>Rome.</HI> He that Reigns now doth not indeed rai&s;e his Family avowedly, but he doth not ea&s;e the people of their Taxes: and as there is no magnificence in his Court, nor any publick buildings now carrying on at <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;o the many vacant Caps, occa&s;ion many empty Palaces: and by this means there is &s;o little expence now made at <HI>Rome,</HI> that it is not po&s;&s;ible for the people to live and pay the Taxes, which hath driven, as is believed, almo&s;t a fourth part of the Inhabitants out of <HI>Rome,</HI> during this Pontificate. And as the pre-emption of the Corn makes that there is no profit made by the Owners, out of the cultivation of the Soil, all that going wholly to the <HI>Pope,</HI> &s;o there are no ways left here of employing one's Mony to any con&s;iderable advantage: For the publick Banks, which are all in the <HI>Pope</HI>'s hand, do not pay in effect three <HI>per cent</HI> tho they pretend to give four <HI>per cent</HI> of intere&s;t. The &s;ettlement is indeed four <HI>per cent,</HI> and this was thought &s;o great an advantage, that actions on the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Bank were bought at a hundred and Sixteen the hundred. But this <HI>Pope</HI> broke through all this, and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">clared he would give all men their Money again, unle&s;s they would pay him thirty <HI>per cent</HI> for the continuing of this Intere&s;t; and thus for a hundred Crowns Principal, one not only paid at fir&s;t one hundred and &s;ixteen; but afterwards thirty, in all one hundred &s;ix and forty for the hundred which is almo&s;t the half lo&s;t: For when&s;oever the <HI>Pope</HI> will pay them back their Money, all the re&s;t is lo&s;t: And while I am here there is a report that the <HI>Pope</HI> is Treating with the <HI>Genoe&s;es</HI> for Money at two <HI>per cent</HI> and if he gets it on tho&s;e Terms, then he will pay his Debts; and the Subjects that have put in Money in this Bank, will, by this means lo&s;e &s;ix and forty <HI>per cent,</HI> which is almo&s;t the half of their Stock. A man of quality at <HI>Rome,</HI> and an eminent Church-man,
<PB N="6" REF="77"> who took me likewi&s;e for one of their Clergy, becau&s;e I wore the habit of a Church-man, &s;aid that it was a horrible &s;candal to the whole <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> World, and made one doubt of the Truth of the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, to &s;ee more oppre&s;&s;ion and cruelty in their Territory, then was to be found even in <HI>Turkey:</HI> tho it being in the hands of <HI>Chri&s;t's</HI> Vicar, one &s;hould expect to find there the pattern of a mild and gentle Government: and how &s;aid he can a man expect to find his Religion here, where the common maxims of Ju&s;tice and Mercy were not &s;o much as known: And I can never forget the lively reflection that a <HI>Roman</HI> Prince made to me upon the folly of all tho&s;e &s;evere Oppre&s;&s;ions, which as they drive away the Inhabitants, &s;o they reduce tho&s;e that are left to &s;uch a degeneracy of Spirit by their nece&s;&s;ities, that the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who&s;e Dominions look &s;o big in the Map, are now brought &s;o low: and if they had kept &s;till the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion they once had of the <HI>&V;nited-Nether|lands,</HI> they would &s;ignifie no more towards their pre&s;ervation, than their other Provinces did: which, by their unskilful conduct they have both di&s;peopled and exhau&s;ted: Whereas by their lo&s;ing tho&s;e &s;even Provinces, tho&s;e States have fallen upon &s;uch wi&s;e Notions of Government, and have drawn &s;o much Wealth, and &s;uch numbers of people together, that <HI>Spain</HI> it &s;elf was now pre&s;erved by them, and was &s;aved in this Age by the lo&s;s it made of tho&s;e Pro|vinces in the la&s;t: and tho&s;e States that if they had remained &s;ubject to <HI>Spain,</HI> would have &s;ignified little to its &s;upport, did that now much more con&s;iderably by being <HI>Allies,</HI> then they could have done if they had &s;haken off their Yoak.</P>
<P>Indeed, if <HI>Spain</HI> had been &s;o happy as to have &s;uch Viceroys and Governors, as it has now in <HI>Nap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">es,</HI> their affairs could not have declined &s;o fa&s;t as they have done.

It is well enough known what a Plague the <HI>Banditi</HI> have been to the Kingdom, for they go|ing in Troops, not only robbed the Country, but were able to re&s;i&s;t an ordinary Body of Souldiers, if they had &s;et on them: The&s;e travelled about, &s;eek|ing for Spoyl all the Summer long, but in Winter they were harboured by &s;ome of the <HI>Neapolitan</HI> Bar|rons, who gave them Quarters: And thereby did not only protect their own Lands, but had them as &s;o many In&s;truments ready to execute their Revenges on their Enemies. This was well known at <HI>Naples,</HI> and there was a Councel that had the care of the re|ducing the <HI>Banditi</HI> committed to them, who as they catched &s;ome few, and hanged them, &s;o they fined &s;uch Barrons as gave them harbour; and it was be|lieved that tho&s;e Fines amounted to near a hundred and fifty thou&s;and Crowns a year: And thus the Di|&s;ea&s;e went on; only now and then there was a little Blood let, which never went to the bottom of the Di&s;temper. But when the pre&s;ent Viceroy entred upon the Government, he re&s;olved to extirpate all the <HI>Banditi,</HI> and he fir&s;t let all the Barons under|&s;tand, that if they harboured them any more, a little Fine would not &s;ave them: but that he would pro|ceed again&s;t them with the utmo&s;t &s;everity, and by this means the <HI>Banditi</HI> could find no Winter Quar|ters: So they betook them&s;elves to &s;ome fa&s;tne&s;&s;es among the Hills, and re&s;olved to make good the Pa&s;&s;es, and to accommodate them&s;elves the be&s;t they could amid&s;t the Mountains. The <HI>Viceroy</HI> &s;ent a great Body again&s;t them, but they defended them|&s;elves for &s;ome time vigorou&s;ly, and in one Sally they killed five hundred men: but at la&s;t, &s;eeing that they were like to be hard pre&s;t; and that the <HI>Viceroy</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="78"> intended to come again&s;t them in Per&s;on, they ac|cepted of the Terms that he offered them, which was a Pardon for what was pa&s;t, both as to Life and Gallies, and &s;ix pence a day for their entertainment in Pri&s;on during Life, or the <HI>Viceroys</HI> plea&s;ure; and &s;o they rendred them&s;elves. They are kept in a large Pri&s;on, and now and then as he &s;ees cau&s;e for it, he &s;ends &s;ome few of them up and down to &s;erve in Garri&s;ons. And thus, beyond all mens expecta|tion, he fini&s;hed this matter in a very few months: and the Kingdom of <HI>Naples</HI> that hath been &s;o long a &s;cene of Pillage and Robbery, is now &s;o much changed, that in no place of <HI>Europe</HI> do the Subjects enjoy a more entire &s;ecurity, As for the Coin, its as all the other <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> money, is &s;o &s;ubject to clip|ping, that the whole money of <HI>Naples</HI> is now light, and far below the true Value, &s;o the <HI>Viceroy</HI> hath re|&s;olved to redre&s;s this: He con&s;iders that the crying down of money, that pa&s;&s;eth upon the Publick cre|dit, is a robbing of tho&s;e in who&s;e hands the money happens to be when &s;uch Proclamations are put out, and therefore he takes a method that is more general, in which every one will bear his &s;hare, &s;o that none will be cru&s;hed by it. He hath laid &s;ome Taxes on the whole Kingdom, and hath got a great many to bring in &s;ome Plate to be Coined: And when he hath thus prepared &s;uch a quantity, as may &s;erve for the circulation that is nece&s;&s;ary, he intends to call in all the old money, and to give out new money for it.

It is a vain imagination to think that the <HI>Christians,</HI> in the primitive times, were able to carry on &s;uch a work; for as this prodigious digging into &s;uch Rocks, mu&s;t have been a very vi&s;ible thing by the Mountaines of Rubbi&s;h that mu&s;t have been brought out, and by the va&s;t number of hands that mu&s;t have been employed in it; &s;o it is ab&s;urd to think that they could hold their <HI>A&s;&s;emblies</HI> amid&s;t the annoyance of &s;o much cor|ruption. I found the &s;teams &s;o &s;trong, that tho I am as little &s;ubject to vapours as mo&s;t men, yet I had all the day long after I was in them, (which was not near an hour) a confu&s;ion, and as it were a boil|ing
<PB N="21" REF="84"> in my head, that di&s;ordered me extreamly; and if there is now &s;o much &s;tagnating Air there, this mu&s;t have been &s;en&s;ible in a more eminent and in|&s;ufferable manner, while there were va&s;t numbers of bodies rotting in tho&s;e niches. But be&s;ides this im|probability that pre&s;ents it &s;elf from the nature of the thing, I called to mind a pa&s;&s;age of a Letter of <HI>Cornelius</HI> that was Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome,</HI> after the middle of the third <HI>Century,</HI> which is pre&s;erved by <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> in his &s;ixth Book, <HI>Chapter</HI> 43. in which we have the State of the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> at that time &s;et forth. There were forty &s;ix <HI>Presbiters,</HI> &s;even <HI>Dea|cons,</HI> as many <HI>Sub-deacons,</HI> and ninety four of the Inferiour Orders of the Clergy among them: there were al&s;o fifteen hundred Widows, and other poor maintained out of the publick Charities. It may be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed that the numbers of the <HI>Chri|&s;tians</HI> were as great when this Epi&s;tle was writ, as they were at any time before <HI>Con&s;tantine's</HI> dayes; for as this was writ at the end of that long peace, of which both <HI>S. Cyprian</HI> and <HI>Lactantius</HI> &s;peak, that had continued above a hundred years; &s;o after this time, there was &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Per&s;ecutions that came &s;o thick one upon another, after &s;hort intervals of quiet, that we cannot think the numbers of the <HI>Christians</HI> increa&s;ed much beyond what they were at this time. Now there are two particulars in this State of the Clergy, upon which one may make a probable e&s;timate of the numbers of the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> the one is their poor, which were but fifteen hundred, now upon an exact &s;urvey, it will be found that where the poor are well looked to, their number ri&s;es generally to be the thirtieth or fortieth part of mankind; and this may be well believed to be the proportion of the poor among the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> of that Age: For as their Charity was vigorous and tender, &s;o we find <HI>Cel&s;us, Julian, Lucian, Porphiry,</HI> and others, object this to the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> of that time, that
<PB N="22" REF="85"> their Charities to the poor drew va&s;t numbers of the lower &s;ort among them, who made them&s;elves <HI>Chri&s;ti|ans</HI> that they might be &s;upplied by their Brethren: So that this being the State of the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> then, we may reckon the poor the thirtieth part, and &s;o fifteen hundred multiplied by thirty, produce five and forty thou&s;and: And I am the more inclined to think that this ri&s;es up near to the full &s;um of their numbers, by the other Character of the numbers of the Clergy, for as there were forty &s;ix <HI>Presbyters,</HI> &s;o there were ninety four of the inferior Orders, who were by two more then the double of the number of the Prie&s;ts; and this was in a time in which the care of Souls was more exactly looked after, then it has been in the more corrupted Ages, the Clergy having then really more work on their hands, the in&s;tructing of their <HI>Catechumenes,</HI> the vi&s;iting their Sick, and the &s;upporting and comforting the weak, being tasks that required &s;o much application, that in &s;o va&s;t a City as <HI>Rome</HI> was in tho&s;e dayes, in which it is pro|bable the <HI>Christians</HI> were &s;cattered over the City, and mixed in all the parts of it, we make a conjecture that is not ill grounded, when we reckon that every <HI>Presbyter</HI> had perhaps abou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> a thou&s;and Souls com|mitted to his care, &s;o this ri&s;es to &s;ix and forty thou|&s;and, which comes very near the &s;um that may be gathered from the other hint, taken from the number of their poor. So that about fifty thou&s;and is the highe&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ccount to which we can rea&s;onably rai&s;e the numbers of the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> in that time; and of &s;o many per&s;ons, the old, the young, and the women, make more then three fourth parts, &s;o that men that were in condition to work were not above twelve thou&s;and, and by con&s;equence, they were in no condition to undertake and carry on &s;o va&s;t a work. If <HI>Cornelius</HI> in that <HI>Letter</HI> &s;peaks of the numbers of the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> in exce&s;&s;ive Terms, and if <HI>Tertullian</HI> in his <HI>Apologetick</HI> hath al&s;o &s;et out the numbers of the
<PB N="23" REF="85"> <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> of his time, in a very high &s;train, that is only to be a&s;cribed to a pompous Eloquence, which di&s;po&s;eth people to magnifie their own party; and we mu&s;t allow a good deal to a hyperbole that is very natural to all that &s;et forth their forces in general Terms. It is true, it is not &s;o clear when tho&s;e va&s;t cavities were dug out of the Rocks. We know that when the Laws of the twelve Tables were made, &s;epulture was then in u&s;e: and <HI>Rome</HI> being then grown to a va&s;t bigne&s;s, no doubt they had repo&s;i|tories for their dead; &s;o that &s;ince none of the <HI>Roman</HI> Authors mention any &s;uch work, it may not be unrea|&s;onable to Imagine that the&s;e Vaults had been wrought and cut out from the fir&s;t beginnings of the City, and &s;o th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> latter Authors had no occa&s;ion to take notice of it. It is al&s;o certain, that tho burning came to be in u&s;e among the <HI>Romans,</HI> yet they re|turned back to their fir&s;t cu&s;tome of burying bodies long before <HI>Constantines</HI> time; &s;o that it was not the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion that produced this change: All our modern Writers take it for granted that the change was made in the times of the <HI>Antonines;</HI> yet there being no Law made concerning it, and nu mention being made in an Age, full of Writers, of any orders that were given for burying places, <HI>Vel&s;erus's</HI> opinion &s;eems more probable, that the cu&s;tome of burning wore out by degrees, and &s;ince we are &s;ure that they once buryed, it is more natural to think that the &s;laves and the meaner &s;ort of people were &s;till buried, that being a le&s;s expence, and a more &s;imple way of be&s;towing their bodies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">han burning, which was both pompous and chargeable, and (i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> there were already burying places prepared) it is much ea&s;ier to Imagine how the cu&s;tome of burying grew Univer&s;al, without any Law made concerning it.</P>
<P>I could not for &s;ome time find out upon what grounds the Modern Criticks take it for granted, that burying began in the times of the <HI>Antonines,</HI> till I
<PB N="24" REF="86"> had the happine&s;s to talk of this matter with the learned <HI>Gronovius,</HI> who &s;eems to be &s;uch a Ma&s;ter of all the Antient learning, as if he had the Authors lying alwayes open before him: He told me, that it was certain the change from burning to burying was not made by the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Emperours, for <HI>Macrobius,</HI> (lib. 7. chap. 7.) &s;ayes, in plain terms, that the Cu|&s;tome of burning the Bodies of the Dead was quite worn out in that Age, which is a clear Intimation that it was not laid a&s;ide &s;o late as by <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> and as there was no Law made by him on that head, &s;o he, and the &s;ucceeding Emperours, gave &s;uch an entire tolleration to <HI>Pagani&s;m,</HI> admitting tho&s;e of that Religion to the greate&s;t Imployments, that it is not to be imagined that there was any order given again&s;t burning; &s;o that it is clear the <HI>Heathens</HI> had changed it of their own accord, otherwayes we &s;hould have found that among the complaints that they made of the grievances, under which they lay from the <HI>Chri&s;tians;</HI> but it is more difficult to fix the time when this change was made. <HI>Gronovius</HI> &s;hewed me a pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Phlegons,</HI> that mentions the Bodies that were laid in the ground, yet he did not build on that, for it may have relation to the cu&s;toms of burying that might be el&s;ewhere. And &s;o <HI>Petro|nius</HI> gives the account of the burial of the <HI>Ephe&s;ian</HI> Matrons Husband: but he made it apparent to me, that burying was commonly practi&s;ed in <HI>Commodus</HI>'s time; for <HI>Xiphilinus</HI> tells us, that in <HI>Pertinax</HI>'s time the friends of tho&s;e whom <HI>Commodus</HI> had ordered to be put to Dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">h, had dug up their Bodies, &s;ome bringing out only &s;ome parts of them, and others rai&s;ing their entire Bodies. The &s;ame Author al&s;o tells us, that <HI>Pertinax</HI> buried <HI>Commodus</HI>'s Body, and &s;o &s;aved it from the rage of the peop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and here is a po&s;itive Evidence, that burying was the common pra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ti&s;e of that time. It is true, it is very probable that as we &s;ee &s;ome of the <HI>Roman</HI> Families continued
<PB N="25" REF="86"> to bury their dead, ev'n when burning was the more common cu&s;tome, &s;o, perhaps, others continued af|ter this to burn their dead, the thing being Indiffe|rent, and no Law being made about it, and there|fore it was particularly objected to the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> af|ter this time, that they abhorred the cu&s;tome of burning the Bodies of the Dead, which is mentio|ned by <HI>Minutius Felix,</HI> but this, or any other evi|dences, that may be brought from Meddals of Con&s;e|crations after this time, will only prove that &s;ome were &s;till burnt, and that the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> practi&s;ed burying Univer&s;ally, as expre&s;&s;ing their belief of the Re&s;urrection; whereas the <HI>Heathens</HI> held the thing indifferent. It is al&s;o clear from the many genuine In&s;criptions that have been found in the <HI>Catacombs,</HI> which bear the dates of the Con&s;uls, that the&s;e were the common Burial places of all the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> of the fourth and fifth <HI>Century;</HI> for I do not remember that there is any one date that is Antienter, and yet not one of the Writers of tho&s;e Ages &s;peak of them as the work of the Primitive <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> They &s;peak indeed of the Burial places of the Martyrs, but that will prove no more but that the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> might have had their Quarters, and their Walks in tho&s;e common Burial places where they laid their Dead, and which might have been known among them, tho it is not likely that they would in times of per&s;ecuti|ons make &s;uch In&s;criptions as might have expo&s;ed the Bodies of their dead Friends to the rage of their Ene|mies. And the Spurious acts of &s;ome Saints and Martyrs are of too little credit to give any &s;upport to the common Opinion. <HI>Dama&s;us</HI>'s Poetry is of no better authority. And th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> tho&s;e Ages were inclined enough to give credit to Fables, yet it &s;eems this of tho&s;e <HI>Catacombs</HI> having been the work of the Pri|mitive Chri&s;tians, was too gro&s;s a thing to have been &s;o early impo&s;ed on the World. And this &s;ilence in an Age, in which Super&s;tition was going on at &s;o great a

<P>It is certain that a man can no where pa&s;s a day of his life both with &s;o much plea&s;ure, and with &s;uch advantage, as he finds in this journey to <HI>Puzzoli</HI> and all along the Bay: but tho anciently this was all &s;o well built, &s;o peopled, and &s;o beautifully laid out, yet no where doth one &s;ee more vi&s;ibly what a change time brings upon all places: for <HI>Naples</HI> hath &s;o in|tirely eat out this place, and drawn its Inhabitants to it, that as <HI>Puzzoli</HI> it &s;elf is but a &s;mall Village, &s;o th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">re is now no other in all this Bay, which was anciently built almo&s;t all round, for there were &s;even big Towns upon it. Having thus told you what I found mo&s;t con&s;iderable in <HI>Naples,</HI> I cannot pa&s;s by that Noble remnant of the <HI>Via Appia</HI> that runs along thirty miles of the way between it and <HI>Rome,</HI> with|out making &s;ome mention of it: this high-way is twelve foot broad, all made of huge &s;tones, mo&s;t of them blew, and they are generally a foot and half large on all &s;ides: the &s;trength of this cau&s;e-way appears in its long duration, for it hath la&s;ted above eighteen hundred Years: and is in mo&s;t places for &s;everal miles together, as intire as when it was fir&s;t made: and the botches that have been made for mending &s;uch places, that have been worn out by time, &s;hews a very vi&s;ible difference between the Ancient and the Modern way of Paving. One thing &s;eems &s;trange, that the way is level with the Earth on both &s;ides: whereas &s;o much w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ight as tho&s;e Stones carry &s;hould have &s;unk the ground under them by its pre&s;&s;ure: Be&s;ides that the Earth, e&s;pecially in low grounds, receives a con&s;tant increa&s;e chiefly by the du&s;t which the Winds or Brooks carry down from the Hills, both which rea&s;ons &s;hould make a more &s;en&s;ible difference between tho&s;e wayes and the &s;oil on both &s;ides: and this makes me apt to believe, that ancient|ly tho&s;e wayes were a little rai&s;ed above the level of the ground, and that a cour&s;e of &s;o many Ages hath now brought them to an equality: Tho&s;e wayes were
<PB N="33" REF="90"> chiefly made for &s;uch as go on foot: for as nothing is more plea&s;ant then to walk along them, &s;o nothing is more inconvenient for Hor&s;es and all &s;orts of car|riage, and indeed Mulets are the only bea&s;ts of bur|then that can hold out long in this Road, which beats all Hor&s;es after they have gone it a little while. There are &s;everal re&s;ts of <HI>Roman</HI> Antiquities at the Mole of <HI>Cajeta;</HI> but the I&s;le of <HI>Caprea,</HI> now called <HI>Crapa,</HI> which is a little way into the Sea off from <HI>Naples,</HI> gave me a &s;trange <HI>Idea</HI> of <HI>Tiberius's</HI> Reign, &s;ince it is hard to tell whether it was more extraor|dinary to &s;ee a Prince abandon the be&s;t Seats and Palaces of <HI>Italy,</HI> and &s;hut him&s;elf up in a little I&s;land, in which I was told there was a Tradition of &s;even little Palaces that he built in it; or to &s;ee &s;o va&s;t a body as the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire &s;o governed by &s;uch a Tyrannical Prince, at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the chief Scene, &s;o that all might have been rever&s;ed long be|fore that the news of it could have been brought to him.

<P>But now I come to <HI>Rome,</HI> which as it was once the Empre&s;s of the World in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of many Ages, &s;o hath in it at pre&s;ent more curious things to entertain the attention of a <HI>Traveller,</HI> then any other place in <HI>Europe.</HI> On the &s;ide of <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> the entry in to <HI>Rome</HI> is very &s;urprizing to &s;trangers, for one cometh along for a great many miles, upon the re|mains of the <HI>Via Flamminia,</HI> which is not indeed &s;o entire as the <HI>Via Appia:</HI> yet there is enough left to rai&s;e a ju&s;t <HI>Idea</HI> of the <HI>Roman</HI> greatne&s;s, who laid
<PB N="34" REF="91"> &s;uch cau&s;e-ways all <HI>Italy</HI> over. And within the Gate of the <HI>Porta di Populo,</HI> there is a Noble <HI>Obelisk,</HI> a va&s;t Fountain, two fine little Churches, like two Twins re&s;embling one another, as well as placed near one another, and on &s;everal hands one &s;ees a long <HI>Vi&s;ta</HI> of &s;treets. There is not a Town in the&s;e parts of the World, where the Churches, Convents, and Palaces are &s;o Noble, and where the other Buildings are &s;o mean, which indeed, di&s;covers very vi&s;ibly the mi&s;ery under which the <HI>Romans</HI> groan. The Churches of <HI>Rome</HI> are &s;o well known, that I will not adven|ture on any de&s;cription of them, and indeed, I had too Tran&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nt a view of them to make it with that degree of exactne&s;s which the &s;ubject requires. <HI>St. Peters</HI> alone would make a big Book, not to &s;ay a long <HI>Letter.</HI> Its length, heighth and breadth are all &s;o exactly proportioned, and the eye is &s;o equally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with all the&s;e, that the whole, upon the fir&s;t view, doth not appear &s;o va&s;t as it is found to be upon a more particular attention: and as the four Pillars upon which the <HI>Cupulo</HI> ri&s;es, are of &s;uch a prodigious bigne&s;s, that one would think they were &s;trong enough to bear any &s;uper&s;tructure what&s;oever; &s;o when one climbs up to the top of that va&s;t heighth, he wonders what Foundation can bear &s;o huge a weight; for as the Chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ch is of a va&s;t heighth, &s;o the <HI>Cupulo</HI> ri&s;es four hundred and fifteen big &s;teps above the Roof of the Church.

The Flooring of the Palaces is all of Brick; which is &s;o very-mean, that one &s;ees the di&s;proportion that is between the Floors and the re&s;t of the Room, not without a &s;en&s;ible preception and di&s;like. It is true, they &s;ay, their Air is &s;o cold and moi&s;t in Winter that they cannot pave with Marble; and the heat is &s;ometimes &s;o great in Summer, that Flooring of Wood would crack
<PB N="36" REF="92"> with heat, as well as be eat up by the vermin that would ne&s;tle in it. But if they kept in their great Palaces &s;ervants to wa&s;h their Floors, with that care that is u&s;ed in <HI>Holland,</HI> where the Air is moi&s;ter, and the climate is more productive of Vermine, they would not find &s;uch effects from wooden Floors, as they pretend. In a word, there are none that lay out &s;o much wealth all at once, as the <HI>Italians</HI> do upon the Building and Fini&s;hing of their Palaces and Gardens, and that afterwards, be&s;tow &s;o little on the pre&s;erving of them: another thing I ob&s;erved in their Palaces, there is, indeed, a great &s;eries of Noble rooms one within another, of which their apart|ments are compo&s;ed, but I did not find, at the end of the apartments, where the Bed Chamber is, &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition of rooms for back-&s;tairs, dre&s;&s;ing-rooms, clo&s;ets, &s;ervants rooms, and other conveniences as are nece&s;&s;ary for accommodating the Apartment. It is true, this is not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for an apartment of State, in which Magnificence is more con&s;idered then con|venience; but I found the &s;ame want in tho&s;e apart|ments in which they lodged; &s;o that notwith&s;tanding all the riches of their Palaces, it can not be &s;aid that they are well lodged in them, and their Gardens are yet le&s;s under&s;tood, and wor&s;e kept then their Pa|laces. It is true, the <HI>Villa Borghe&s;e</HI> ought to be ex|cepted, where as there is a prodigious collection of <HI>bas reliefs,</HI> with which the Walls are, as it were, covered all over, that are of a va&s;t value; &s;o the &s;tatues within, of which &s;ome are of Porphiry, and others of Touch&s;tone, are amazing things: The whole grounds of this Park, which is about three miles in compa&s;s, and in which there are &s;ix or &s;even lodges, are laid out &s;o &s;weetly, that I thought I was in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Park when I walked over it. The <HI>Villa Pamphilia</HI> is better &s;cituated upon a higher ground, and hath more Water-works, and twice the extent of the other in Soil, but neither doth the
<PB N="37" REF="92"> Hou&s;e nor Statues approach to the riches of the other, nor are the grounds &s;o well laid out and &s;o well kept. But for the Furniture of the Palaces of <HI>Rome,</HI> the publick apartments are all covered over with Pictures and for tho&s;e apartments in which they lodge they are generally furni&s;hed either with red Velvet, or red Damask, with a broad gold Galloon at every breadth of the &s;tuff, and a gold Fringe at top and bottom, but there is very little Tapi&s;try in <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>I have been carried into all this di&s;gre&s;&s;ion, from the general view, that I was giving you of the <HI>Popes</HI> Palace. I named one part of it which well ingage me into new digre&s;&s;ion, as it well de&s;erves one, and that is the Library of the <HI>Vatican:</HI> The Ca&s;e is great, but that which is lodged in it is much greater; for here is a collection of Books that filleth a mans eye: There is fir&s;t a great Hall, and at the end of it there runs out on both &s;ides, two Galleries of &s;o va&s;t a length, that tho the half of them is already fur|ni&s;hed with Books, yet one would, hope that there is room left for more new Books then the World will ever produce. The <HI>Heidelberg</HI> Library &s;tands by it &s;elf, and filleth the one &s;ide of the Gallery, as the Duke of <HI>&V;rbins</HI> Library of Manu&s;cripts filleth the other. But tho the&s;e la&s;t are very fair and beautiful, yet they are not of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="2 letters">ch Antiquity as tho&s;e of <HI>Hei|delberg:</HI> When it appe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">red that I was come from <HI>England,</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIIIs.

But that which took up alm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t half of one day that I &s;pent at one time in this place, related to the pre&s;ent
<PB N="38" REF="93"> di&s;pute that is on foot between <HI>Mr. Schel&s;trate</HI> the Library-keeper, and <HI>Mr. Maimbourg,</HI> concerning the Council of <HI>Constance.</HI> The two points in debate are the words of the decree made in the fourth Se&s;&s;ion and the <HI>Popes</HI> confirmation. In the fourth Se&s;&s;ion, according to the <HI>French</HI> Manu&s;cripts, a Decree was made, &s;ubjecting the <HI>Pope,</HI> and all other per&s;ons what&s;oever, to the Authority of the Council, and to the Decrees it was to make, and to the Reforma|tion it intended to e&s;tabli&s;h both in the Head and the Members: which as it implies that the Head was corrupted and needed to be reformed, &s;o it &s;ets the Council &s;o directly above the <HI>Pope,</HI> that this Se&s;&s;ion being confirmed by the <HI>Pope,</HI> putteth tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert the <HI>Popes</HI> infallibility to no &s;mall &s;traits: For if <HI>Pope Martin,</HI> that approved this Decree was infallible, then this Decree is good &s;till, and if he was not infallible, no other <HI>Pope</HI> was infallible: To all thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Schel&s;trate</HI> an&s;wers from his Manu&s;cripts, that the words of a Reformation, in Head and Members, are not in the Decree of that Se&s;&s;ion; and he did &s;hew me &s;everal Manu&s;cripts, of which two were evidently writ during the &s;itting of the Council, and were not at all da&s;hed, in which the&s;e words were not. I know the hand and way of writing of that Age too well to be ea&s;ily mi&s;taken in my judgement concerning tho&s;e Manu&s;cripts but if tho&s;e words are wanting, there are other words in them that &s;eem to be much &s;tronger for the &s;uperiority of the Council above that <HI>Pope.</HI> For it is Decreed, that <HI>Popes,</HI> and all other per&s;ons, were bound to &s;ubmit to the deci&s;ions of the Council, as to Faith: which words are not in the <HI>French</HI> Manu&s;cripts: Upon this I told <HI>M. Schel&s;trate</HI> that I thought the words in the&s;e Manu&s;cripts were &s;tronger then the other: &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ce the word Reformation, as it was u&s;ed in the tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter"> of that Council, belonged chiefly to the cor|recting
<PB N="39" REF="93"> of abu&s;es, it being often applied to the regu|lations that were made in the <HI>Mona&s;tick-Orders,</HI> when they were brought to a more exact ob&s;ervation of the rule of their Order: So tho the Council had decreed a Reformation both of Head and Members, I do not &s;ee that this would import more than that the <HI>Papacy</HI> had fallen into &s;ome di&s;orders that needed a Reformation: and this is not denied even by tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ert the <HI>Pope's</HI> infallibility: but a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to points of Faith, that is expre&s;ly a&s;&s;erted in the <HI>Roman</HI> Manu&s;cripts, is a much more po&s;itive evidence again&s;t the <HI>Pope's</HI> Infallibility: and the word Faith is not capable of &s;o large a &s;en&s;e as may be ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to Reformation. But this difference, in &s;o main a point b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">tween Manu&s;cripts concerning &s;o late a Tran&s;action, g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ve me an occa&s;ion to reflect on the va&s;t uncertainty of Tradition, e&s;pecially of matters that are at a great di&s;tance from us; when tho&s;e that were &s;o lately Tran&s;acted, are &s;o differently repre&s;ented in Manu&s;cripts, and in which, both tho&s;e of <HI>Paris</HI> and <HI>Rome</HI> &s;eem to carry all po&s;&s;ible evid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nces of &s;inc rity. As for the <HI>Popes</HI> confirmation of that Decree, it is true by a General Bull, <HI>Pope Martin</HI> confirmed the Council of <HI>Constance</HI> to &s;uch a period; but be&s;ides that, he made a particular Bull, as <HI>Schel&s;trat</HI> a&s;&s;ured me, in which he enumerated all the Decrees that he confirmed, and among tho&s;e, this Decree concerning the Superiority of the Council is not named; this &s;eemed to be of much more impor|tance, and therefore I de&s;ired to &s;ee the Original of the Bull: for their &s;eem to be ju&s;t rea&s;ons to appre|hend a forgery here: He promi&s;ed to do his endea|vours, tho he told me that would not be ea&s;ie, for the Bulls were &s;trictly kept; and the next day when I came, hoping to &s;ee it, I could not be admitted: but he a&s;&s;ured me that if that had not been the la&s;t day of my &s;tay at <HI>Rome,</HI> he would have procured a
<PB N="40" REF="94"> Warrant for my &s;eeing the Original: &s;o this is all I can &s;ay as to the Authenticalne&s;s of that Bull: But &s;uppo&s;ing it to be genuine, I could not agree to <HI>M. Schel&s;trate</HI> that the General Bull of Confirmation, ought to be limited to the other that enumerates the particular D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">crees: but &s;ince that particular Bull was never di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">covered till he hath found it out, it &s;eems it was &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">cretly made, and did not pa&s;s accord|ing to the forms of the Con&s;i&s;tory: and was a frau|dulent thing of which no noi&s;e was to be made in that Age, and therefore in all the di&s;pute that fol|lowed in the Concel of <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> between the <HI>Pope</HI> and the Council, upon this very point, no mention was ever made of it by either &s;ide: and thus it can have no force, unle&s;s it be to di&s;cover the Artifices and fraud of that Court: that at the &s;ame time in which the nece&s;&s;ity of their affairs obliged the <HI>Pope</HI> to con|firm the Decrees of the Council, he contrived a &s;ecret Bull, which in another Age might be made u&s;e of, to weaken the Authority of the General Confirmation that he gave: and therefore a Bull that doth not pa&s;s in due form and is not p o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ulgated, is of no Authority: and &s;o this Pretended Bull cannot limit the other Bull.

<P>Upon the general contempt that all the <HI>Romans</HI> have, for the pre&s;ent <HI>Pontificate,</HI> one made a plea&s;ant reflection to me, he &s;aid tho&s;e Popes that intended to rai&s;e their Families, as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y &s;aw the cen&s;ure that this brought upon them, &s;o they &s;tudied to le&s;&s;en it by other things that might &s;often the Spirits of the peo|ple.

His life hath been certainly very in|nocent, and free of all tho&s;e publick &s;candals that make a noi&s;e in the World, and there is at pre&s;ent a regularity in <HI>Rome,</HI> that de&s;erveth great com|mendation, for publick Vices are not to be &s;een there: His per&s;onal &s;obriety is a &s;o &s;ingular.

<P>And here one thing cometh into my mind, which perhaps is not ill grounded, that the poverty of a Nation, not only di&s;peoples it, by driving the peo|ple out of it, but by weakning the natural fertility of the Subjects; for as men and women well cloath|ed, and well fed, that are not exhau&s;ted with per|petual labour, and with the tearing anxieties that want brings with it, mu&s;t be much more lively then tho&s;e that are pre&s;&s;ed with want; &s;o it is very likely that the one mu&s;t be much more di&s;po&s;ed to pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">pagate then the other: and this appeared more evident to me, when I compared the fruitfulne&s;s of <HI>Geneva</HI> and <HI>Switzerland,</HI> with the barrenne&s;s that reigns over all <HI>Italy.</HI> I &s;aw two extraordinary in|&s;tances of the copious production of <HI>Geneva:</HI> Mr. <HI>Tronchin</HI> that was Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity, and Fa|ther to the judicious and worthy Profe&s;&s;or of the &s;ame name, that is now there, died at the age of &s;even<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y &s;ix years, and had a hundred and fifteen per&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ns all alive, that had either de&s;cended from him, called him Father.

I &s;aw likewi&s;e there the Original of the&s;e Emblematical Prophecies, relating to <HI>England,</HI> that the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> have had at <HI>Rome</HI> near &s;ixty years, and of which I had &s;ome time ago procured a Copy, &s;o I found my Copy was true. I hapned to be at <HI>Rome,</HI> during St. <HI>Gregory</HI>'s Fair and Fea&s;t, which la&s;ted &s;everal dayes. In his Church the <HI>Ho&s;ty</HI> was expo&s;ed: and from that, all that came thither, went to the Chappel that was once his Hou&s;e, in which his Statue and the Table where he &s;erved the poor, are pre&s;erved: I &s;aw &s;uch va&s;t numbers of people there, that one would have thought all <HI>Rome</HI> was got to|gether. They all kneeled down to his Statue, and after a prayer &s;aid to it, they ki&s;&s;ed his foot, and every one touched the Table with his Beads, as hoping to draw &s;ome vertue from it. I will add nothing of the &s;everal Obelisks and Pillars that are in <HI>Rome,</HI> of the celebrated Chappels that are in &s;ome of the great Churches, in particular tho&s;e of <HI>Sixtus</HI> the V. and <HI>Paul</HI> the V. in <HI>Santa Maria Maggiore,</HI> of the Water works in the <HI>Quirinal,</HI> the <HI>Vatican,</HI> and in many of the Vineyards: Nor will I go out of <HI>Rome</HI> to de&s;cribe <HI>Fre&s;cati,</HI> (for <HI>Tivoly</HI> I did not &s;ee) The young Prince <HI>Borge&s;e,</HI> who is in|deed one of the glories of <HI>Rome,</HI> as well for his Learning as for his Virtue, did me the Honour to carry me thither with tho&s;e two learned Abbots <HI>Fa|bretri</HI> and <HI>Nazari,</HI> and entertained me with a mag|nificence that became him better to give, than me to receive. The Water-works in the <HI>Aldobrandin</HI> Palace have a magnificence in them beyond all that
<PB N="53" REF="100"> I ever &s;aw in <HI>France,</HI> the mixture of Wind with the Water, and the Thunders and Storms that this ma|keth is noble: The Water-works of the <HI>Ludovi&s;io,</HI> and the <HI>Monte Dragone,</HI> have likewi&s;e a greatne&s;s in them that is natural, and indeed the riches that one meets with in all places within Doors in <HI>Italy,</HI> and the poverty that one &s;eeth every where abroad, are the mo&s;t un&s;uitable things imaginable: but it is very likely that a great part of their moveable Wealth will be ere long carried into <HI>France;</HI> for as &s;oon as any Picture or Statue of great value is of|fered to be &s;old, tho&s;e that are imployed by the King of <HI>France,</HI> do pre&s;ently buy it up, &s;o that as that King hath already, the greate&s;t collection of Pictures that is in <HI>Europe,</HI> he will very probably in a few years more, bring together the chief Trea&s;ures of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>I have now given you an account of all that ap|peared mo&s;t remarkable to me in <HI>Rome.</HI> I &s;hall to this add a very extraordinary piece of Natural Hi&s;tory, that fell out there within the&s;e two years, which I had fir&s;t from tho&s;e two learned Abbots <HI>Fa|bretti</HI> and <HI>Nazari,</HI> and that was afterwards more authentically confirmed to me by Cardinal <HI>Howard,</HI> who was one of the Congregation of Cardinals that examined and judged the matter. There were two Nuns near <HI>Rome,</HI> one as I remember was in the Ci|ty, and the other not far from it, who, after they had been for &s;ome years in a Nunnery, perceived a very &s;trange change in Nature, and that their Sex was altered, which grew by &s;ome degrees a total alteration in one: and tho the other was not &s;o entire a change, yet it was vi&s;ible &s;he was more Man than Woman; upon this the matter was look|ed into: That which naturally offereth it &s;elf here, is that the&s;e two had been alwayes what they then appeared to be; but that they had gone into a Nun|nery
<PB N="54" REF="101"> in a di&s;gui&s;e to gratifie a brutal appetite. But to this, when I propo&s;ed it, an&s;wer was made, that as the brea&s;ts of a Woman that remained &s;till, did in a great mea&s;ure &s;hake off that objection, &s;o the proofs were given &s;o fully of their having been real females, that there was no doubt left of that, nor had they given any &s;ort of &s;candal in the change of their Sex; And if there had been any room left to &s;u&s;pect a cheat or di&s;gui&s;e, the proceedings would have been both more &s;evere and more &s;ecret: and the&s;e per&s;ons would have been burnt, or at lea&s;t put to death in &s;ome terrible manner. Some Phy&s;i|tians and Chyrurgions were appointed to examine the matter, and at la&s;t, after a long and exact enquiry, they were judged to be ab&s;olved from their vows, and were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the obligation of a Reli|gious life, and required to go in mens habit. One of them was a Valet de Chambre to a <HI>Roman</HI> Mar|que&s;s, when I was there: I heard of this matter only two dayes before I left <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;o that I had not time to enquire after it more particularly; but I judged it &s;o extraordinary, that I thought it was worth communicating it to &s;o curious an Inquirer into nature.</P>
<P>And &s;ince I am upon the &s;ubject of the changes that have been made in nature, I &s;hall add one of another &s;ort that I examined while I was at <HI>Geneva.</HI> There is a Mini&s;ter of S. <HI>Gervais,</HI> Mr. <HI>Gody,</HI> who hath a Daughter, that is now Sixteen years old: Her Nur&s;e had an extraordinary thickne&s;s of hearing, at a year old, the Child &s;poke all tho&s;e little words that Children begin u&s;ually to learn at that age, but &s;he made no progre&s;s; yet this was not ob&s;erved, till it was too late, and as &s;he grew to be two years old, they perceived there that &s;he had lo&s;t her hearing, and was &s;o deaf that ever &s;ince tho &s;he hears great noi&s;es, yet &s;he hears nothing that one can
<PB N="55" REF="101"> &s;peak to her. It &s;eems while the milk of her Nur&s;e, was more abundant, and that the Child &s;uckt more moderately the fir&s;t year, tho&s;e humors in the blood and milk had not that effect on her, that appeared after &s;he came to &s;uck more violently: and that her Nur&s;es milk being in le&s;s quantity, was thicker, and more charged with that vapour that occa&s;ioned the deafne&s;s. But this Child hath by ob&s;erving the motions of the mouths and lips of others, acquired &s;o many words, that out of the&s;e &s;he hath formed a &s;ort of <HI>jargon,</HI> in which &s;he can hold conver&s;ation whole days with tho&s;e that can &s;peak her own Lan|guage. I could under&s;tand &s;ome of her words, but could not comprehend a period, for it &s;eemed to be a confu&s;ed noi&s;e: She knows nothing that is &s;aid to her, unle&s;s &s;he &s;eeth the motion of their mouths that &s;peak to her; &s;o that in the night, when it is nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;peak to her, they mu&s;t light a Candle: Only one thing appeared the &s;trange&s;t part of the whole narration: She hath a Si&s;ter with whom &s;he has practi&s;ed her Language more than with any other: and in the night by laying her hand on her Si&s;ters mouth, &s;he can perceive by that, what &s;he &s;ayes, and &s;o can di&s;cour&s;e with her in the Night. It is true, her Mother told me that this did not go far, and that &s;he found out only &s;ome &s;hort period in this manner, but it did not hold out very long: Thus this young Woman without any pains taken on her, hath meerly by a natural &s;agacity found out a method of holding di&s;cour&s;e, that doth in a great mea&s;ure le&s;&s;en the mi&s;ery of her deafne&s;s. I examined this matter critically, but only the Si&s;ter was not pre&s;ent, &s;o that I could not &s;ee how the con|ver&s;ation pa&s;t between them in the dark.</P>
<P>But before I give over writting concerning this place, I cannot hinder my &s;elf, from giving you an account of a conver&s;ation that I had with one of the
<PB N="56" REF="102"> mo&s;t Celebrated per&s;ons that lives in it. I was talk|ing concerning the credit that the Order of the <HI>Je|&s;uites</HI> had every where; It was &s;aid that all the World mi&s;tru&s;ted them, and yet by a &s;trange &s;ort of contradiction all the World tru&s;ted them, and tho it was well known that every <HI>Je&s;uite</HI> was truer to the Intere&s;ts of his Order, than he could be to the Intere&s;ts of any Prince what&s;oever, yet tho&s;e Princes that would be very careful not to &s;uffer &s;pies to come into their Courts or into their Councils &s;uffered tho&s;e &s;pies to come into their brea&s;ts and Con&s;ciences: and tho Princes were not generally very tender in tho&s;e parts, yet as they had oft as much guilt, &s;o they had &s;ometimes as much fear as other People, which a Dextrous &s;py knew well how to mannage: Upon which that per&s;on that pretended to be a zealous Catholick, added, that for their part they con&s;idered only the Character that the Church gave to a Prie&s;t; and if the Church qualified him to do the functions of a Prie&s;t, they thought it very need|le&s;s to inquire after other per&s;onal Qualities, which were but common things, whereas the other was all Divine. On the Contrary, they thought it was &s;o much the better to have to do with a poor Igno|rant Prie&s;t: for then they had to do only with the Church, and not with the man. Pur&s;uant to this, that per&s;ons Confe&s;&s;or was the greate&s;t and the mo&s;t notorious block head that could be found, and when they were asked why they made u&s;e of &s;o weak a Man, they an&s;wered, becau&s;e they could not find a weaker: and when ever they found one better qualified that way, if it were a groom or a foot-man that got into Prie&s;t's Orders, they would cer|tainly make u&s;e of him. For they would ask Council of a friend; but they knew no other u&s;e of a Confe&s;&s;or, but to Confe&s;s to him, and to re|ceive Ab&s;olution from him: and in &s;o doing, they
<PB N="57" REF="102"> pretended they acted as became a true Catholick, that con&s;idered only the power of the Church in the Prie&s;t, without regarding any thing el&s;e.</P>
<P>So far have I entertained you with the &s;hort ramble that I made, which was too &s;hort to de|&s;erve the name of Travelling, and therefore the en|quiries or Ob&s;ervations that I could make, mu&s;t be received with the abatement that ought to be made for &s;o &s;hort a &s;tay: and all will be of a piece, when the remarks are as &s;light, as the abode I made in the places through which I pa&s;t was &s;hort. I have avoided the troubling you with things that are commonly known, &s;o if I have not entertained you with a long recital of ordinary matters, yet I have told you nothing but what I &s;aw and knew to be true, or that I had from &s;uch hands, that I have very good rea&s;on to believe it: and I fancy that the things which made the greate&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on my &s;elf, will be acceptably received by you, to whom, as upon many accounts, I owe all the ex|pre&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem and gratitude that I can ever pay; &s;o I had a more particular rea&s;on that deter|mined me to give you, &s;o full an account of all I &s;aw and ob&s;erved: for as you were plea&s;ed at par|ting to do me the Honour to de&s;ire me to commu|nicate to you &s;uch things as appeared mo&s;t remark|able to me, &s;o I found &s;uch a va&s;t advantage in many places, but more particularly at <HI>Venice, Rome</HI> and <HI>Naples,</HI> by the happine&s;s I have of being known to you, and of being &s;o far con&s;idered by you, that I could give a Copious Account both of your per&s;on and Studies, to tho&s;e in whom your curious di&s;co|veries had kindled that e&s;teem for you, which all the World payeth both to you and to your immortal enquiries into nature, which are among the pecu|liar ble&s;&s;ings of this Age: and that are read with no le&s;s care and plea&s;ure in <HI>Italy</HI> then in <HI>England.</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="103"> This was &s;o well received, that I found the great advantage of this Honour I did my &s;elf, in a&s;&s;um|ing the glorious Title of one of your friends, and I owe a great part of that di&s;tinction which I met with, to this favourable character that I gave my &s;elf; &s;o that if I made any progre&s;s in the enqui|ries, that &s;o &s;hort a &s;tay could enable one to make, I owe it in &s;o a peculiar a manner to you, that this return that I make is but a very &s;mall part of that I owe you, and which I will be endeavouring to pay you to the la&s;t moment of my life.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Thought I had made &s;o full a point at the con|clu&s;ion of my la&s;t Letter, that I &s;hould not have given you the trouble of reading any more Letters of the Volume of the former: But new Scenes and new Matter offering them&s;elves to me, I fancy you will be very gentle to me, if I Engage you again to two or three Hours reading. From <HI>Civita Vec|chia</HI> I came to <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> where if there were a Road as Safe as the Harbour is covered; and if the Harbour were as large as it is convenient, it were certainly one of the mo&s;t important places in the World; all is &s;o well defended, that it is with re&s;pect either to Storms or Enemies the &s;ecure&s;t Port that can be &s;een any where. The Freedoms of this place, though it is now at the mercy of the Cit|tadel,
<PB N="2" REF="105"> are &s;uch, and its &s;cituation draweth &s;o much Trade to it, that there one &s;eeth another appear|ance of wealth then I found in any Town of <HI>France,</HI> and there is a new &s;treet lately built there, that for the beauty of the buildings, and the largene&s;s of the &s;treet, is the Noble&s;t I ever &s;aw. There is in that Port a perpetual heat, and the Sun was &s;o &s;trong in the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> week, that I was often dri|ven off the Key. I made a Tour from thence through <HI>Provence, Languedoc,</HI> and <HI>Dauphin&egrave;.</HI> I will offer you no account of <HI>Ni&s;mes,</HI> nor of the <HI>Amphi|theatre</HI> in it, or the <HI>Pont du Gar</HI> near it; which as they are &s;tupendious things, &s;o they are &s;o copi|ou&s;ly de&s;cribed by many, and are &s;o generally known to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, that if you have never gone that way your &s;elf, yet you mu&s;t needs have re|ceived &s;o particular a relation of them from tho&s;e that have &s;een them on their way to <HI>Montpelier,</HI> that I judge it needle&s;s to enlarge upon them: Nor will I &s;ay any thing of the Soil, the Towns, or any other remarkable things that I found there.</P>
<P>I have a much &s;tronger inclination to &s;ay &s;ome|what, concerning the per&s;ecution which I &s;aw in its rage and utmo&s;t fury; and of which I could give you many in&s;tances that are &s;o much beyond all the common mea&s;ures of barbarity and cruelty, that I confe&s;s they ought not to be believed, unle&s;s I could give more po&s;itive proofs of them, than are fitting now to be brought forth: and the particu|lars that I could tell you are &s;uch, that if I &s;hould relate them with the nece&s;&s;ary circum&s;tances of time, place, and per&s;ons, the&s;e might be &s;o fatal to many that are yet in the power of their Enemies, that my regard to them re&s;trains me. In &s;hort I do not think that in any Age there ever was &s;uch a violation of all that is &s;acred, either with relation to God or Man: And what I &s;aw and knew there
<PB N="3" REF="105"> from the fir&s;t hand, hath &s;o confirmed all the <HI>I|dea</HI>'s that I had taken from Books of the cruelty of that Religion, that I hope the impre&s;&s;ion that this hath made upon me &s;hall never end but with my life: The applau&s;es that the whole Clergy give to this way of proceeding, the many Panegyricks that are already writ upon it, of which, be&s;ides the more pompous ones that appear at <HI>Paris,</HI> there are numbers writ by &s;maller Authors in every Town of any note there; and the Sermons that are all flights of flattery upon this &s;ubject, are &s;uch evi|dent demon&s;trations of their &s;en&s;e of this matter; that what is now on foot may be well term<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">d the Act of the whole Clergy of that Kingdom, which yet hath been hitherto e&s;teemed the mo&s;t moderate part of the <HI>Roman</HI> Communion. If any are more moderate than others; and have not &s;o far laid off human nature as not to go in entirely into tho&s;e bloody practi&s;es, yet they dare not own it, but whi&s;per it in &s;ecret as if it were half Trea&s;on: but for the greater part, they do not only magnifie all that is done, but they animate even the <HI>Dragoons</HI> to higher degrees of rage: and there was &s;uch a heat &s;pread over all the Country, on this occa&s;ion, that one could not go into any Ordinary, or mix in any promi&s;cuous conver&s;ation, without finding &s;uch ef|fects of it, that it was not ea&s;ie for &s;uch as were toucht with the lea&s;t degree of compa&s;&s;ion for the mi&s;eries that the poor <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> &s;uffered, to be a witne&s;s to the In&s;ultings that they mu&s;t meet with in all places. Some perhaps imagine that this hath not been approved in <HI>Italy,</HI> and it is true there were not any publick rejoycings upon it at <HI>Rome;</HI> no Indulgences nor <HI>Te Deums</HI> were heard of: And the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> faction being &s;o prevalent there, it is not &s;trange if a cour&s;e of proceedings, that is with|out an example, was &s;et forth, by all that were of that intere&s;t, in its proper colours; of which I
<PB N="4" REF="106"> met with &s;ome in&s;tances my &s;elf, and could not but &s;mile to &s;ee &s;ome of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Faction &s;o far to forget their Courts of Inqui&s;ition as to argue a|gain&s;t the Conver&s;ions by the <HI>Dragoons,</HI> as a re|proach to the <HI>Catholick</HI> Religion. Yet the Pope was of another mind, for the Duke <HI>d'E&s;tr&eacute;es</HI> gave him an account of the Kings proceedings in this matter very copiou&s;ly, as he him&s;elf related it. Upon which the Pope approved all, and expre&s;&s;ed a great &s;atisfaction in every thing that the King had done in that matter; and the Pope added, that he found &s;ome Cardinals [as I remember the Duke <HI>d'E&s;tr&eacute;es</HI> &s;aid two] were not plea&s;ed with it, and had taken the liberty to cen&s;ure it, but the Pope &s;aid, they were to blame: The Duke <HI>d'E&s;trees</HI> did not name the two Cardinals, though he &s;aid he be|lieved he knew who they were: and it is very likely that Cardinal <HI>Pio</HI> was one, for I was told that he &s;poke freely enough of this matter. I mu&s;t take the liberty to add one thing to you, that I do not &s;ee that Great Monarch is to be &s;o much blamed in this matter as his Religion is, which, without que&s;tion, obligeth him to extirpate Hereticks, and not to keep his faith to them: &s;o that in&s;tead of cen&s;uring him, I mu&s;t only lament his being bred up in a Religion that doth certainly oblige him to deve&s;t him&s;elf of humanity, and to violate his faith, when&s;oever the cau&s;e of his Church and Religion re|quireth it: Or if there is any thing in this conduct that cannot be entirely ju&s;tified from the principles of that Religion, it is this, that he doth not put the Hereticks to death out of hand, but that he forceth them, by all the extremities po&s;&s;ible, to &s;ign an ab|juration, that all the World mu&s;t needs &s;ee is done again&s;t their Con&s;ciences: and this being the only end of their mi&s;eries, tho&s;e that would think any &s;ort of death a happy conclu&s;ion of their &s;ufferings, &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of &s;uch a glorious i&s;&s;ue out of
<PB N="5" REF="106"> their troubles, are prevailed on by the many lingring deaths of which they &s;ee no end, to make Ship|wrack of their faith: This appearance of mercy in not putting men to death, doth truly verifie the cha|racter that <HI>Solomon</HI> giveth of the tender mercies of the wicked, that they are cruel.</P>
<P>But I will &s;top here, though it is not ea&s;ie to re|tire from &s;o copious a &s;ubject, that as it affordeth &s;o much matter, &s;o upon many accounts rai&s;eth a heat of thought that is not ea&s;ily governed. I will now lead you to a Scene that giveth le&s;s pa&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>I pa&s;t the Winter at <HI>Geneva,</HI> with more &s;atisfa|ction that I had thought it was po&s;&s;ible for me to have found any where out of <HI>England:</HI> though that received great allaies from the mo&s;t lamentable Stories that we had every day from <HI>France:</HI> but there is a &s;orrow by which the heart is made bet|ter. I ought to make the mo&s;t publick acknow|ledgments po&s;&s;ible for the Extraordinary Civilities that I met with in any one particular: but that is too low a Subject to entertain you with it. That which plea&s;ed me mo&s;t, was of a more publick na|ture, before I left <HI>Geneva,</HI> the numbers of the <HI>En|gli&s;h</HI> there was &s;uch, that I found we could make a &s;mall Congregation. For we were Twelve or Four|teen, &s;o I addre&s;&s;ed my &s;elf to the Councel of Twenty five for liberty, to have our own wor&s;hip in our own Language, according to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Li|turgy. This was immediately granted in &s;o obli|ging a manner, that as there was not one per&s;on that made any exception to it, &s;o they &s;ent one of their body to me, to let me know that in ca&s;e our number &s;hould grow to be &s;o great, that it were fit for us to a&s;&s;emble in a Church, they would grant us one, which had been done in Queen <HI>Maries</HI> reign: but till then we might hold our a&s;&s;emblies as we thought fit. So after that time, during the
<PB N="6" REF="107"> re&s;t of my &s;tay there, we had every Sunday our de|votions according to the Common Prayer, Morn|ing and Evening: and at the Evening Prayer, I preacht in a Room that was indeed too large for our &s;mall Company, but there being a con&s;iderable number in <HI>Geneva</HI> that Under&s;tand <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and in particular &s;ome of the Profe&s;&s;ors and Mini&s;ters, we had a great many &s;trangers that met with us: and the la&s;t Sunday I gave the Sacrament according to the way of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and upon this occa&s;ion I found a general joy in the Town, for this that I had given them an opportunity of ex|pre&s;&s;ing the re&s;pect they had for our Church, and as in their publick Prayers they always prayed for the Churches of <HI>Great Brittain,</HI> as well as for the King, &s;o in private di&s;cour&s;e they &s;hewed all po&s;&s;i|ble e&s;teem for our Con&s;titutions, and they &s;poke of the unhappy divi&s;ions among us, and of the Sepa|ration that was made from us, upon the account of our Government and Ceremonies with great re|gret and di&s;like. I &s;hall name to you only two of their Profe&s;&s;ours, that as they are Men of great di|&s;tinction, &s;o they were the Per&s;ons with whom I conver&s;ed the mo&s;t. The one is Mr. <HI>Turretin,</HI> a Man of great Learning, that by his Indefatigable Study and Labour has much worn out and wa&s;ted his &s;trength; amid&s;t all the affluence of a great plenty of Fortune to which he was born, one di&s;|cerns in him all the mode&s;ty of a humble and mor|tified temper, and of an active and fervent charity, proportioned to his abundance or rather beyond it; and there is in him &s;uch a melting zeal for Reli|gion, as the pre&s;ent conjuncture calls for, with all the &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of piety and devotion, which &s;hews it &s;elf both in private conver&s;ation and in his mo&s;t edifying Sermons by which he enters deep into the con&s;ciences of his Hearers. The other is Mr. <HI>Tron|chin,</HI> a Man of a &s;trong head, and of a clear and
<PB N="7" REF="107"> correct Judgment; who has all his thoughts well dige&s;ted; his conver&s;ation has an engaging charm in it that cannot be re&s;i&s;ted. He is a Man of Ex|traordinary virtue and of a readine&s;s to oblige and &s;erve all Per&s;ons, that has &s;carce any mea&s;ures. His Sermons have a &s;ublimity in them that &s;trikes the hearer as well as it edifies him. His thoughts are noble, and his Eloquence is Ma&s;culine and exact, and has all the Maje&s;ty of the Chair in it, temper|ed with all the &s;oftne&s;s of per&s;ua&s;ion, &s;o that he not only convinces his Hearers, but &s;ubdues them and triumphs over them. In &s;uch Company it was no wonder if time &s;eemed to go off too fa&s;t, &s;o that I left <HI>Geneva</HI> with a concern, that I &s;hould not have felt in leaving any place out of the I&s;le of <HI>Brittain.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Geneva,</HI> I went a &s;econd time through <HI>Swit|zerland</HI> to <HI>Ba&s;ile:</HI> At <HI>Avanche</HI> I &s;aw the Noble frag|ments of a great <HI>Roman</HI> Work, which &s;eems to have been the <HI>Portico</HI> to &s;ome Temple: the heads of the Pillars are about four foot &s;quare of the <HI>Jonick</HI> Order: The Temple hath been dedicated to <HI>Neptune</HI> or &s;ome Sea god; for on the fragments of the <HI>Architrave,</HI> which are very beautiful, there are <HI>Dolphins</HI> and <HI>Sea-hor&s;es</HI> in <HI>bas-reliefs;</HI> and the neighbourhood of the place to the Lakes of <HI>Iverdun</HI> and <HI>Morat</HI> maketh this more evident: there is al&s;o a Pillar &s;tanding up in its full height, or rather the corner of a building, in which one &s;eeth the re&s;ts of a regular Architecture in two ranks of Pillars: If the ground near this were carefully &s;earch'd, no doubt it would di&s;cover more re&s;ts of that Fabrick. Not far from this is <HI>Morat;</HI> and a little on this &s;ide of it is a Chappel, full of the bones of the <HI>Burgundians</HI> that were killed by the <HI>Switzers,</HI> when this place was be&s;ieged by the famous <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> who lo&s;t a great Army be|fore it, that was entirely cut off by the be&s;ieged; the in&s;cription is very extraordinary, e&s;pecially for that
<PB N="8" REF="108"> Age: for the bones being &s;o piled up that the Chap|pel is quite filled with them: the in&s;cription bears, that <HI>Charles</HI> Duke of <HI>Burgundy</HI>'s Army having be&s;ieg|ed <HI>Morat, Hoc &s;ui Monumentum reliquit,</HI> had left that Monument behind it. It cannot but &s;eem &s;trange to one that views <HI>Morat,</HI> to imagine how it was po&s;&s;ible for a Town &s;o &s;ituated, and &s;o &s;lightly fortified, to hold out again&s;t &s;o powerful a Prince and &s;o great an Army that brought Cannon before it. I met with nothing remarkable between this and <HI>Ba&s;ile,</HI> except that I &s;taid &s;ometime at <HI>Bern,</HI> and knew it better; and at this &s;econd time it was, that my Lord <HI>Advoyer d'Er|lach</HI> gave order to &s;hew me the Original Records of the famous Proce&s;s of the four <HI>Dominicans;</HI> upon which I have retoucht the Letter that I writ to you la&s;t year, &s;o that I now &s;end it to you with the cor|rections and enlargements, that this &s;econd &s;tay at <HI>Bern</HI> gave me occa&s;ion to make.</P>
<P><HI>Ba&s;ile</HI> is the Town of the greate&s;t extent of all <HI>Switzerland,</HI> but it is not inhabited in proportion to its extent. The <HI>Rhine</HI> maketh a crook before it: and the Town is &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing ground, which hath a noble effect on the eye, when one is on the Bridge, for it looketh like a Theater. Little <HI>Ba&s;ile</HI> on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> is almo&s;t a fourth part of the whole: The Town is &s;urrounded with a Wall and Ditch, but it is &s;o expo&s;ed on &s;o many &s;ides, and hath now &s;o dreadful a Neighbour within a quarter of a League of it, the Fort of <HI>Huningh,</HI> that it hath nothing to tru&s;t to, humanly &s;peaking, but its Union with the other Cantons. The maxims of this Canton have hindred its being better peopled than it is, the ad|vantages of the Burger&s;hip are &s;uch, that the Citi|zens will not &s;hare them with &s;trangers; and by this means they do not admit them. For I was told, that during the la&s;t War, that <HI>Al&s;atia</HI> was &s;o often the &s;eat of both Armies, <HI>Ba&s;ile</HI> having then a neutrality, it might have been well filled, if it had not been for
<PB N="9" REF="108"> this maxim. And it were a great happine&s;s to all the Cantons, if they could have different degrees of Burger&s;hip, &s;o that the lower degrees might be given to &s;trangers for their encouragement to come and live among them: and the higher degrees which qualifie men for the advantagious Employments of the State, might be re&s;erved for the ancient Families of the Na|tives. <HI>Ba&s;ile</HI> is divided into &s;ixteen Companies, and every one of the&s;e hath four Members in the little Council, &s;o that it con&s;i&s;teth of &s;ixty four: But of tho&s;e four, two are cho&s;en by the Company it &s;elf, who are called the Ma&s;ters, and the other two are cho&s;en by the Councel out of the Company; and thus as there are two &s;orts of Councellers, cho&s;en in tho&s;e different manners, there are al&s;o two chief Ma|gi&s;trates. There are two Burgherma&s;ters that Reign by turns, and two <HI>Zun&s;t-Ma&s;ters</HI> that have al&s;o their turns, and all is for life: And the la&s;t are the heads of the Companies, like the <HI>Roman Tribunes</HI> of the peo|ple. The Fabrick of the Stadt-Hou&s;e is ancient; there is very good Painting <HI>in fre&s;co</HI> upon the Walls; one Piece hath given much offence to the <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> though they have no rea&s;on to blame the Reforma|tion for it; &s;ince it was done &s;everal years before it, in the year 1510. It is a repre&s;entation of the Day of Judgement, and after Sentence given, the Devil is repre&s;ented driving many before him to Hell, and among the&s;e there is &s;everal Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks. But it is believed that the Councel which &s;ate &s;o long in this place, acting &s;o vigorou&s;ly again&s;t the Pope, ingaged the Town into &s;uch a hatred of the Papacy, that this might give the ri&s;e to this repre&s;entation. The more learned in the Town a&s;cribe the beginning of the Cu|&s;tom in <HI>Ba&s;ile</HI> of the Clocks anticipating the time a full Hour, to the &s;itting of the Councel, and they &s;ay that in order to the advancing of bu&s;ine&s;s, and the &s;hortning their Se&s;&s;ions, they ordered their Clocks to be &s;et forward an Hour, which continueth to this
<PB N="10" REF="109"> day. The Cathedral is a great old <HI>Gothick</HI> building; the Chamber where the Councel &s;ate, is of no great reception, and is a very ordinary Room: <HI>Era&s;mus</HI>'s Tomb is only a plain In&s;cription upon a great bra&s;s plate: There are many of <HI>Holbens</HI>'s Pictures, who was a Native of <HI>Ba&s;ile,</HI> and was recommended by <HI>Era&s;mus</HI> to King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII. the two be&s;t are a <HI>Corpo</HI> or <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> dead, which is certainly one of the be&s;t in the World: There is another Piece of his in the Stadt-Hou&s;e, for this is in the publick Library, of about three or four foot &s;quare; in which, in &s;ix &s;everal Cantons, the &s;everal parts of our Saviours Pa&s;&s;ion are repre&s;ented with a life and beauty that can|not be enough admired; it is valued at ten thou&s;and Crowns; it is in Wood, but hath that fre&s;hne&s;s of Colour on it, that &s;eems peculiar to <HI>Holbens</HI>'s Pencil. There is al&s;o a Dance that he painted on the Walls of an Hou&s;e where he u&s;ed to drink, that is &s;o worn out that very little is now to be &s;een, except &s;hapes and po&s;tures: but the&s;e &s;hew the exqui&s;itene&s;s of the hand. There is another longer Dance that runneth all along the &s;ide of the Convent of the <HI>Augu&s;tinians.</HI> which is now the <HI>French</HI> Church, which is Deaths Dance; there are above three&s;core figures in it at full length of Per&s;ons of all ranks, from Popes, Empe|rors and Kings, down to the meane&s;t &s;orts of People, and of all Ages and Profe&s;&s;ions, to whom Death ap|peareth in an in&s;olent and &s;urprizing po&s;ture, and the &s;everal pa&s;&s;ions that they expre&s;s are &s;o well &s;et out, that this was certainly a great de&s;ign. But the <HI>fre&s;co</HI> being expo&s;ed to the Air, this was &s;o worn out &s;ome time ago, that they ordered the be&s;t Painter they had to lay new Colour on it, but this is &s;o ill done that one had rather &s;ee the dead &s;hadows of <HI>Holbens</HI>'s Pencil, than this cour&s;e work. There is in <HI>Ba&s;ile</HI> a Gun-Smith that maketh Wind-Guns, and he &s;hewed me one that as it received at once Air for ten &s;hot, &s;o it had this particular to it, which he pretends is his
<PB N="11" REF="109"> own Invention, that he can di&s;charge all the Air that can be parcelled out in ten &s;hot at once, to give a home blow. I confe&s;s tho&s;e are terrible in&s;truments, and it &s;eems the intere&s;t of Mankind to forbid them quite, &s;ince they can be imployed to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate per|&s;ons &s;o dextrou&s;ly, that neither noi&s;e nor &s;ire will di&s;cover from what hand the &s;hot cometh. The Library of <HI>Ba&s;ile</HI> is, by much the be&s;t in all <HI>Switzer|land,</HI> there is a fine collection of Medals in it, and a very hand&s;ome Library of Manu&s;cripts; the Room is Noble, and di&s;po&s;ed in a very good method. Their Manu&s;cripts are chiefly the <HI>Latine</HI> Fathers, or <HI>Latine</HI> Tran&s;lations of the <HI>Greek</HI> Fathers, &s;ome good Bibles, they have the Go&s;pels in <HI>Greek</HI> Capitals, but they are vitiou&s;ly writ in many places: There is an infinite number of the Writers of the darker Ages, and there are Legends and Sermons without number. All the Books that were in the &s;eueral Mona&s;teries at the time of the Reformation were carefully pre&s;erved; and they believe that the Bi&s;hops who &s;ate here in the Council, brought with them a great many Manu|&s;cripts which they never carried away. Among their Manu&s;cripts I &s;aw four of <HI>Hu&s;s</HI>'s Letters that he writ to the <HI>Bohemians</HI> the day before his death, which are very devout, but exce&s;&s;ively &s;imple. The Manu&s;cripts of this Library are far more numerous than tho&s;e of <HI>Bern,</HI> which were gathered by <HI>Bongar&s;ius,</HI> and left by him to the publick Library there: They are indeed very little con&s;idered there, and are the wor&s;t kept that ever I &s;aw: But it is a Noble collection of all the ancient <HI>Latine</HI> Authors, they have &s;ome few of the be&s;t of the <HI>Roman</HI> times, writ in great Characters, and there are many that are &s;even or eight hundred years old.</P>
<P>There is in <HI>Ba&s;ile</HI> one of the be&s;t collections of Medals that ever I &s;aw in private hands; together with a Noble Library, in which there are Manu|&s;cripts of good antiquity that belong to the Family
<PB N="12" REF="110"> of <HI>Fe&s;ch,</HI> and that goeth from one Learned Man of the Family to another: For this Inheritance can on|ly pa&s;s to a Man of Learning, and when the Fa|mily produceth none, then it is to go to the pub|lick. In <HI>Ba&s;ile</HI> as the &s;everal Companies have been more or le&s;s &s;trict in admitting &s;ome to a Freedom in the Company, that have not been of the Trade, &s;o they retain their priviledges to this day. For in &s;uch Companies that have once received &s;uch a number that have not been of the Trade as grew to be the majority, the Trade hath never been a|ble to recover their intere&s;t. But &s;ome Companies have been more cautious, and have never admitted any but tho&s;e that were of the Trade, &s;o that they retain their intere&s;t &s;till in Government. Of the&s;e the Butchers were named for one, &s;o that there are always four Butchers in the Council: The great Council con&s;i&s;teth of Two Hundred and Forty, but they have no power left them, and they are only a&s;&s;embled upon &s;ome extraordinary occa&s;ions, when the little Council thinketh fit to communicate any important matter to them. There are but &s;ix Ba|liages that belong to <HI>Bazile,</HI> which are not Employ|ments of great advantage; for the be&s;t of them doth afford to the Bailif only a Thou&s;and livres a year: They reckon that there are in <HI>Ba&s;ile</HI> Three Thou&s;and Men that can bear Arms, and that they could rai&s;e Four Thou&s;and more out of the Canton, &s;o that the Town is almo&s;t the half of this State, and the whole maketh Thirty Pari&s;hes. There are Eighteen Profe&s;&s;ors in this Univer&s;ity; and there is a Spirit of a more free and generous Learning &s;tirring there, then I &s;aw in all tho&s;e parts. There is a great decency of habit in <HI>Bazile</HI> and the garb both of the Coun&s;ellers, Mini&s;ters, and Profe&s;&s;ors, their &s;tiff Ruffs, and their long Beards, have an Air that is Augu&s;t: The appointments are but &s;mall, for Coun&s;ellers, Mini&s;ters and Profe&s;&s;ors have but
<PB N="13" REF="110"> a Hundred Crowns a piece: It is true many Mini|&s;ters are Profe&s;&s;ors &s;o this mendeth the matter a little: But perhaps it would go better with the State of Learning there, if they had but half the number of Profe&s;&s;ors, and if tho&s;e were a little bet|ter incouraged. No, where is the rule of St. <HI>Paul</HI> [of Women having on their heads the badge of the authority under which they are brought, which by a phra&s;e that is not extraordinary, he calleth power] better ob&s;erved than at <HI>Bazile;</HI> for all the Married Women go to Church with a coif on their heads, that is &s;o folded, that as it cometh down &s;o far as to cover their eyes, &s;o another fold|ing covereth al&s;o their Mouth and Chin, &s;o that nothing but the no&s;e appears, and then all turns backward in a folding that hangeth down to their midleg. This is always white, &s;o that there is there &s;uch a &s;ight of white heads in their Churches as cannot be found any where el&s;e: The unmarried Women wear hats turned up in the brims before and behind; and the brims of the &s;ides being about a foot broad, &s;tand out far on both hands: This fa&s;hion is al&s;o at <HI>Strasburg,</HI> and is worn there al&s;o by the Married Women.</P>
<P>I mentioned formerly the con&s;tant danger to which this place is expo&s;ed from the neighbour|hood of <HI>Huninghen;</HI> I was told that, at fir&s;t, it was pretended that the <HI>French</HI> King intended to build only a &s;mall Fort there, and it was believed that one of the Burgo-ma&s;ters of <HI>Bazile,</HI> who was thought not only the wi&s;e&s;t man of that Canton, but of all <HI>Switzerland,</HI> was gained to lay all Men a&s;leep, and to a&s;&s;ure them that the &s;uffering this Fort to be built &s;o near them, was of no impor|tance to them, but now they &s;ee too late their fatal error: For the place is great, and will hold a Gar|ri&s;on of Three or Four Thou&s;and Men; it is a <HI>Pentagone,</HI> only the &s;ide to the <HI>Rhine</HI> is &s;o large,
<PB N="14" REF="111"> that if it went round on that &s;ide, I believe it mu&s;t have been a <HI>Hexagone;</HI> the Ba&s;tions have all <HI>Oril|lons,</HI> and in the middle of them there is a void &s;pace, not filled up with earth, where there is a Magazine built &s;o thick in the Vault that it is proof again&s;t Bombs; The Remparts are &s;trongly faced, there is a large Ditch, and before the Cortine, in the middle of the Ditch, there runs all along a Horn-work which is but Ten or Twelve foot high; and from the bottom of the Rampart, there goeth a Vault to this Horn-work, that is for conveying of Men for its defence; before this Horn-work there is a half Moon, with this that is peculiar to tho&s;e new Fortifications, that there is a Ditch that cuts the half Moon in an Angle, and maketh one half Moon within another: beyond that there is a Counter-Scarp about Twelve foot high above the Water, with a covered way, and a <HI>glacy</HI> de&s;igned, though not executed. There is al&s;o a great Horn-work be&s;ides all this, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">uns out a huge way with its out-works towards <HI>Bazile;</HI> there is al&s;o a Bridge laid over the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and there being an I|&s;land in the River, where the Bridge is laid, there is a Horn-work that filleth and fortifieth it. The Buildings in this Fort are beautiful, and the Square can hold above Four Thou&s;and Men; the Works are not yet quite fini&s;hed, but when all is com|pleated, this will be one of the &s;tronge&s;t places in <HI>Europe:</HI> There is a Cavalier on one or two of the Ba&s;&s;ions, and there are half Moons before the Ba|&s;tions, &s;o that the <HI>Switzers</HI> &s;ee their danger now, when it is not ea&s;ie to redre&s;s it. This place is &s;ci|tuated in a great Plain, &s;o that it is commanded by no ri&s;ing ground on any &s;ide of it. I made a little Tower into <HI>Al&s;ace,</HI> as far as <HI>Mountbelliard;</HI> the Soil is extream rich, but it hath been &s;o long a Frontier Country; and is, by con&s;equence, &s;o ill peopled, that it is in many places over-grown with Woods:
<PB N="15" REF="111"> In one re&s;pect it is fit to be the &s;eat of War, for it is full of Iron-works, which bring a great deal of Money into the Country. I &s;aw nothing pecu|liar in the Iron-works there (except that the &s;ides of the great Bellows were not of Leather but of Wood, which &s;aves much Money) &s;o I will not &s;tand to de&s;cribe them. The River of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> all from <HI>Bazile</HI> to <HI>Spire,</HI> is &s;o low, and is on both &s;ides &s;o covered with woods, that one that cometh down in a Boat hath no &s;ight of the Country: The River runneth &s;ometimes with &s;uch a force, that nothing but &s;uch Woods could pre&s;erve its Banks, and even the&s;e are not able to &s;ave them quite, for the Trees are often wa&s;hed away by the very Roots, &s;o that in many places tho&s;e Trees lye along in the Channel of the River: It hath been al&s;o thought a &s;ort of a Fortification to both &s;ides of the River, to have it thus faced with Woods, which maketh the pa&s;&s;ing of Men dangerous, when they mu&s;t march for &s;ometime after their pa&s;&s;age through a <HI>defil&eacute;.</HI> The fir&s;t night from <HI>Bazile</HI> we came to <HI>Bri&s;ac,</HI> which is a poor and mi&s;erable Town, but it is a noble Fortification, and hath on the <HI>We&s;t-&s;ide</HI> of the River, over which a Bridge is laid, a regular Fort of Four or Five Ba&s;tions. The Town of <HI>Bri&s;ac</HI> ri&s;eth all on a Hill which is a con&s;idera|ble heigth; there were near it two Hills, the one is taken within the Fortification, and the other is &s;o well levelled with the ground, that one cannot &s;o much as find out where it was; All the ground about for many miles is plain, &s;o that from the Hill, as from a Cavalier, one can &s;ee exactly well, e&s;pecially with the help of a Pro&s;pect, all the mo|tions of an Enemy in ca&s;e of a Siege: The Fortifi|cation is of a huge compa&s;s, above a <HI>French</HI> league, indeed almo&s;t a <HI>German</HI> league; the Ba&s;tions are quite filled with Earth, they are faced with brick, and have a huge broad Ditch full of Water around
<PB N="16" REF="112"> them, the Counter&s;carp, the covered way, which hath a pali&s;ade within the <HI>Parapet,</HI> and the <HI>Glacy,</HI> are all well exec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">ted; there is a half Moon before every Cortine: the Ba&s;tions have no <HI>Orillons</HI> except one or two, and the Cortines are &s;o di&s;po&s;ed that a good part of them defendeth the Ba&s;tion. The Garri&s;on of this place in time of War mu&s;t needs be Eight or Ten Thou&s;and Men; there hath not been much done of late to this place only the Ditch is &s;o adju&s;ted that it is all defended by the flanks of the Ba&s;tions. But the noble&s;t place on the <HI>Rhine</HI> is <HI>Strasburg:</HI> It is a Town of a huge extent, and hath a double Wall and Ditch all round it; the inner Wall is old and of no &s;trength, nor is the outward Wall very good, it hath a <HI>Fau&s;&s;ebraye,</HI> and is faced with Brick Twelve or Fifteen Foot a|bove the Ditch: the Counter&s;carp is in an ill con|dition, &s;o that the Town was not in ca&s;e to make any long re&s;i&s;tance; but it is now &s;trongly fortified. There is a Cittadel built on that &s;ide that goeth towards the <HI>Rhine,</HI> that is much &s;uch a Fort as that of <HI>Huningh,</HI> and on the &s;ide of the Cittadel towards the Bridge, there is a great Horn-work that runs out a great way with out-works belonging to it; there are al&s;o &s;mall Forts at the two chief Gates that lead to <HI>Al&s;ace;</HI> by which the City is &s;o bri|dled that the&s;e can cut off all its communication with the Country about, in ca&s;e of a revolt; the Bridge is al&s;o well Fortified; there are al&s;o Forts in &s;ome I&s;lands in the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and &s;ome Redoubts: &s;o that all round this place, there is one of the great|e&s;t Fortifications that is in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Hitherto the Capitulation with relation to Reli|gion hath been well kept, and there is &s;o &s;mall a number of new Converts, and the&s;e are for the greate&s;t part &s;o incon&s;iderable, they not being in all above Two Hundred as I was told: The <HI>Lutherans</HI> for the greate&s;t part retain their animo&s;ities almo&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="112"> to an equal degree both again&s;t <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Calvi|ni&s;ts.</HI> I was in their Church, where if the Mu&s;ick of their P&s;alms plea&s;ed me much, the irreverence in &s;inging, it being free to keep on or put off the Hat, did appear very &s;trange to me: The Churches are full of Pictures, in which the chief pa&s;&s;ages of our Saviours life are repre&s;ented; but there is no &s;ort of religious re&s;pect payed them, they bow when they name the Holy Gho&s;t, as well as at the name of <HI>Je&s;us;</HI> but they have not the Ceremonies that the <HI>Lutherans</HI> of <HI>Saxony</HI> u&s;e, which Mr. <HI>Bebel,</HI> their Profe&s;&s;or of Divinity, &s;aid was a great happine&s;s, for a &s;imilitude in outward rites might di&s;po&s;e the ignorant People to change too ea&s;ily. I found &s;e|veral good People both of the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Mini&s;ters and others, acknowledge that there was &s;uch a cor|ruption of morals &s;pread over the whole City, that as they had ju&s;tly drawn down on their heads the plague of the lo&s;s of their liberty, &s;o this ha|ving toucht them &s;o little they had rea&s;on to look for &s;everer &s;trokes: One &s;eeth, in the ruine of this City, what a mi&s;chievous thing the popular pride of a free City is: they fancied they were able to defend them&s;elves, and &s;o they refu&s;ed to let an <HI>Im|perial</HI> Garri&s;on come within their Town; for if they had received only Five Hundred Men, as that &s;mall number would not have been able to have oppre&s;t their Liberties, &s;o it would have &s;o &s;ecured the Town that the <HI>French</HI> could not have be&s;ieged it, without making War on the Empire: but the Town thought this was a diminution of their Free|dom, and &s;o cho&s;e rather to pay a Garri&s;on of Three Thou&s;and Souldiers, which as it exhau&s;ted their Revenue, and brought them under great Taxes, &s;o it proved too weak for their defence when the <HI>French</HI> Army came before them. The Town be|gins to &s;ink in its Trade, notwith&s;tanding the great circulation of Money that the expence of the Forti|fications

There was a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">nimo&s;ity between two of the chief Families of the Town, <HI>Dietrick</HI> and <HI>Obrecht,</HI> the former was the Burgoma&s;ter, and was once almo&s;t run down by a Faction that the other had rai&s;ed again&s;t him; but he turned the tide, and got &s;uch an advantage a|gain&s;t <HI>Obrecht,</HI> who had writ &s;omewhat again&s;t the conduct of their affairs, that he was condemned and Beheaded for writing Libels again&s;t the Govern|ment. His Son is a Learned Man, and was Profe&s;|&s;or of the Civil Law; and he to have his turn of revenge again&s;t <HI>Dietrick,</HI> went to <HI>Paris</HI> la&s;t Summer, and that he might make his Court the better, changed his Religion. <HI>Dietrick</HI> had been always looked on as one of the chief of the <HI>French</HI> Faction, though he had been at fir&s;t an <HI>Imperiali&s;t,</HI> &s;o it was thought that he &s;hould have been well rewarded; yet it was expected that to make him&s;elf capable of that, he &s;hould have changed his Religion, but he was an antient Man, and would not purcha&s;e his Court at that rate: &s;o without any rea&s;on given, and again&s;t the expre&s;s words of the Capitulation, he was confined to one of the midland Provinces of <HI>France,</HI> as I remember it was <HI>Limo&s;in;</HI> and thus he that hath been thought the chief cau&s;e of this Towns failing under the power of the <HI>French,</HI> is the fir&s;t Man that hath felt the effects of it. The Library here is con&s;iderable, the Ca&s;e is a great Room ve|ry well contrived, for it is divided into Clo&s;ets all over the body of the Room, which runs about the&s;e as a Gallery, and in the&s;e Clo&s;ets all round there are the Books of the &s;everal Profe&s;&s;ions lodged apart; there is one for Manu&s;cripts in which there are &s;ome of con&s;iderable Antiquity, I need &s;ay nothing
<PB N="19" REF="113"> to you of the va&s;t heighth, and the <HI>Gothick</HI> Archi|tecture of the Steeple and of the great Church, nor of the curious Clock where there is &s;o va&s;t a variety of motions, for the&s;e are well known. The <HI>bas reliefs</HI> upon the tops of the great Pillars of the Church are not &s;o vi&s;ible, but they are &s;urprizing; for this being a Fabrick of Three or Four Hundred Years old, it is very &s;trange to &s;ee &s;uch repre&s;enta|tions as are there. There is a Proce&s;&s;ion repre&s;ent|ed, in which a Hog carrieth the Pot with the Ho|ly Water, and A&s;&s;es and Hogs in Prie&s;tly Ve&s;tments follow to make up the Proce&s;&s;ion; there is al&s;o an A&s;s &s;tanding before an Altar, as if he were going to Con&s;ecrate, and one carrieth a Ca&s;e with Reliques, within which one feeth a Fox, and the trains of all that go in this Proce&s;&s;ion, are carried up by Mon|kies. This &s;eems to have been made in hatred of the Monks whom the Secular Clergy abhorred at that time, becau&s;e they had drawn the Wealth, and the following of the World after them, and they had expo&s;ed the Secular Clergy &s;o much for their ignorance, that it is probable after &s;ome Ages, the Monks falling under the &s;ame contempt, the Secular Clergy took their turn in expo&s;ing them in &s;o la&s;t|ing a repre&s;entation to the &s;corn of the World. There is al&s;o in the Pulpit a Nun cut in Wood, lying along, and a Frier lying near her with his Breviary open before him, and his hand under the Nuns habit, and the Nuns feet are &s;hod with Iron Shoes. I confe&s;s I did not look for the&s;e things, for I had not heard of them; but my Noble Friend Mr. <HI>Ablancourt</HI> viewed them with great exactne&s;s, while he was the <HI>French</HI> Kings Re&s;ident at <HI>Strasburg,</HI> in the company of one of the Magi&s;trates that wait|ed on him; and it is upon his credit, to which all that know his eminent &s;incerity, know how much is due, that I give you this particular.</P>
<P>From <HI>Strasburg</HI> we went down the <HI>Rhine</HI> to <HI>Phi|lipsburg,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="114"> which lieth at a quarter of a miles di&s;tance from the River, it is but a &s;mall place, the Ba&s;tions are but little; there is a Ravelline before almo&s;t all the Cortines, and there lye &s;uch Mari&s;hes all round it, that in the&s;e lieth the chief &s;trength of the place. The <HI>French</HI> had begun a great Crown-work on the &s;ide that lieth to the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and had ca&s;t out a Horn-work beyond that; but by all that appears it &s;eems they intended to continue that Crown work quite round the Town, and to make a &s;econd Wall and Ditch all round it; which would have Enlarged the place va&s;tly, and made a compa&s;s capable e|nough to lodge above Ten Thou&s;and Men; and this would have been &s;o terrible a Neighbour to the <HI>Pa|latinate</HI> and all <HI>Franconia</HI> that it was a Ma&s;ter-piece in <HI>Charles Lewis,</HI> the late Elector <HI>Palatine,</HI> to En|gage the Empire into this Siege. He &s;aw well how much it concerned him to have it out of the hands of the <HI>French,</HI> &s;o that he took great care to have the Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI>'s Camp &s;o well &s;upplied with all things nece&s;&s;ary during the Siege, that the Army lay not under the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s all the while. From thence in three Hours time we came to <HI>Spire,</HI> which is &s;o naked a Town that if it were attacked, it could not make the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance. The Town is neither great nor rich, and &s;ub&s;i&s;teth chiefly by the <HI>Imperial</HI> Chamber that &s;itteth here, though there is a con&s;tant di&s;pute between the Town and the Chamber concerning Priviledges; for the Govern|ment of the Town, pretends that the Judges of the Chamber, as they are private Men, and out of the Court of Judicature, are &s;ubject to them; and &s;o about a year ago they put one of the Judges in Pri|&s;on; on the other hand the Judges pretend that their Per&s;ons are &s;acred. It was the con&s;ideration of the Chamber that procured to the Town the neutrality that they injoyed all the la&s;t War. I thought to have &s;een the forms of this Court, and the way of
<PB N="21" REF="114"> laying up, and pre&s;erving their Records, but the Court was not then &s;itting. The Building, the Halls and Chambers of this Famous Court are mean beyond imagination, and look liker the Halls of &s;ome &s;mall Company, then of &s;o great a body; and I could not &s;ee the places where they lay up their Archives: The Government of the City is all <HI>Lu|theran,</HI> but not only the Cathedral is in the hands of the Bi&s;hop and Chapter, but there are likewi&s;e &s;everal Convents of both Sexes, and the <HI>Je&s;uites</HI> have al&s;o a Colledge there. There is little remarka|ble in the Cathedral, which is a huge building in the <HI>Gothick</HI> manner of the wor&s;t &s;ort. The Tombs of many Emperours that lie buried there, are re|markable for their meanne&s;s; they being only great Flag-&s;tones layed on &s;ome &s;mall Stone balli&s;ters of a foot and a half high: There are al&s;o the marks of a ridiculous Fable concerning St. <HI>Bernard,</HI> which is too fooli&s;h to be related, yet &s;ince they have taken &s;uch pains to pre&s;erve the remembrance of it, I &s;hall venture to write it. There are from the Gate all along the <HI>Nef</HI> of the Church up to the Steps that go up to the Quire, Four round Plates of Bra&s;s, a|bove a foot Diameter, and at the di&s;tance of Thir|ty foot one from another; laid in the pavement, on the fir&s;t of the&s;e is ingraven: <HI>O Clemens;</HI> on the &s;econd, <HI>O Pia;</HI> on the third, <HI>O Felix;</HI> and on the fourth, <HI>Maria:</HI> The la&s;t is about Thirty Foot di&s;tant from a Statue of the Virgins; &s;o they &s;ay that St. <HI>Bernard</HI> came up the whole length of the Church at four &s;teps, and that tho&s;e four plates were laid where he &s;tept: and that at every &s;tep he pro|nounced the word that is engraven on the Plate, and when he came to the la&s;t, the Image of the Virgin an&s;wered him. <HI>Salve Bernarde:</HI> upon which he an|&s;wered, <HI>let a Woman keep &s;ilence in the Church,</HI> and that the <HI>Virgins</HI> Statue has kept &s;ilence ever &s;ince, this la&s;t part of the Story is certainly very credible.
<PB N="22" REF="115"> He was a man of Learning that &s;hewed me this; and he repeated it &s;o gravely to me, that I &s;aw he either believed it, or at lea&s;t that he had a mind to make me believe it: and I asked him as gravely if that was firmly believed there, he told me that one had lately writ a Book to prove the truth of it, as I re|member, it was a <HI>Je&s;uit:</HI> he acknowledged it was not an Article of Faith, &s;o I was &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>There is in the Cloi&s;ter an old <HI>Gothick</HI> repre&s;enta|tion of our Saviours Agony in Stone, with a great many Figures of his Apo&s;tles, and the Company that came to &s;eize him, that is not ill Sculpture, for the Age in which it was made, it being &s;ome Ages old. The <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> have a Church in this Town, but their numbers are not con&s;iderable: I was told there were &s;ome ancient Manu&s;cripts in the Library, that belongeth to the Cathedral; but one of the Preben|daries to whom I addre&s;&s;ed my &s;elf, being, accord|ing to the <HI>German</HI> cu&s;tom, a man of greater quality than learning, told me he heard they had &s;ome anci|ent Manu&s;cripts, but he knew nothing of it, and the Dean was ab&s;ent, &s;o I could not &s;ee them, for he kept one of the keys. The lower Palatinate is certainly one of the &s;weete&s;t Countries of all <HI>Germany:</HI> It is a great Plain till one cometh to the Hills of <HI>Heidelberg:</HI> the Town is ill &s;cituated, ju&s;t in a bottom between two ranges of Hills, yet the Air is much commended: I need &s;ay nothing of the Ca&s;tle, nor the prodigious Wine Cellar, in which, though there is but one cele|brated Tun that is &s;eventeen foot high, and twenty &s;ix foot long, and is built with a &s;trength liker that of the ribs of a &s;hip, than the Staves of a Tun; yet there are many other Tuns of &s;uch a prodigious big|ne&s;s, that they would &s;eem very extraordinary if this va&s;t one did, not Eclip&s;e them. The late Prince <HI>Charles Lewis</HI> &s;hewed his capacity in the peopling and and &s;ettling this State, that had been &s;o entirely ruin|ed, being for many years the Seat of War, for in four
<PB N="23" REF="115"> years time he brought it to a Flouri&s;hing condition: He rai&s;ed the Taxes as high as was po&s;&s;ible without di&s;peopling his Country, and all mens E&s;tates were valued, and they were taxed at five <HI>per cent</HI> of the va|lue of their E&s;tates; but their E&s;tates were not va|lued to the rigour, but with &s;uch abatements as have been ordinary in <HI>England</HI> in the times of Sub&s;idies; &s;o that when the Son offered to bring the Taxes down to two <HI>per cent</HI> of the real value; the Subjects all de&s;ired him rather to continue them as they were. There is no Prince in <HI>Germany</HI> that is more ab&s;olute than the <HI>Elector Palatine,</HI> for he layeth on his Subjects what Taxes he plea&s;eth, without being limited to any forms of Government. And here I &s;aw that which I had always believed to be true, that the Subjects of <HI>Ger|many</HI> are only bound to their particular Prince, for they &s;wear Allegiance &s;imply to the Elector, without any re&s;erve for the Emperor, and in their Prayers for him they name him their Soveraign. It is true the Prince is under &s;ome ties to the Emperor, but the Subjects are under none. And by this <HI>D. Fabritius,</HI> a learned and judicious Profe&s;&s;or there, explained tho&s;e words of <HI>Pareus</HI>'s Commentary on the <HI>Romans,</HI> which had re&s;pect only to the Princes of the Empire: and were quite mi&s;under&s;tood by tho&s;e who fancied that they favoured Rebellion; for there is no place in <HI>Europe</HI> where all rebellious Doctrine is more born down than there. I found a great &s;pirit of modera|tion with relation to tho&s;e &s;mall controver&s;ies that have occa&s;ioned &s;uch heat in the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Churches reigning in the Univer&s;ity there, which is in a great mea&s;ure owing to the prudence, learning, and the happy temper of mind of <HI>D. Fabritius,</HI> and <HI>D. Miek;</HI> who as they were long in <HI>England,</HI> &s;o they have that gene|rous largene&s;s of Soul, which is the Noble Ornament of many of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Divines. Prince <HI>Charles Lewis</HI> &s;aw that <HI>Manheim</HI> was marked out by Nature to be the mo&s;t important place of all his Territory, it be|ing
<PB N="24" REF="116"> &s;cituated in the point where the <HI>Neckar</HI> falleth in|to the <HI>Rhine:</HI> So that tho&s;e two Rivers defending it on two &s;ides, it was capable of a good Fortification: It is true the Air is not thought whol&s;ome; and the Water is not good, yet he made a fine Town there, and a Noble Cittadel with a regular Fortification a|bout it, and he de&s;igned a great Palace there, but he did not live to build it. He &s;aw of what advantage Liberty of Con&s;cience was to the peopling of his Country, &s;o as he &s;uffered the <HI>Jews</HI> to come and &s;et|tle there, he re&s;olved al&s;o not only to &s;uffer the three Religions tolerated by the Laws of the Empire to be profe&s;&s;ed there, but he built a Church for them all three, which he called the Church of the Concord, in which both <HI>Calvini&s;ts, Lutherans</HI> and <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> had, in the order in which I have &s;et down, the exerci&s;e of their Religion, and he maintained the peace of his Principality &s;o entirely, that there was not the lea&s;t di&s;order occa&s;ioned by this tolleration: This, indeed, made him to be lookt on as a Prince that did not much con&s;ider Religion him&s;elf: He had a wonder|ful application to all affairs, and was not only his own chief Mini&s;ter, but he alone did the work of many.</P>
<P>But I were Inju&s;t, if I &s;hould not &s;ay &s;omewhat to you of the Princely vertues and the Celebrated probity of the pre&s;ent Prince Elector upon whom that Dignity is devolved by the extinction of &s;o many Princes that in this Age compo&s;ed the mo&s;t numerous Family of any of that rank in <HI>Europe.</HI> This Prince as he is in many re&s;pects an honour to the Religion that he profe&s;&s;es, &s;o is in nothing more to be com|mended by tho&s;e who differ from him, than for his exact adhering to the promi&s;es he made his Subjects with relation to their Religion, in which he has not even in the &s;malle&s;t matters, broke in upon their e&s;ta|bli&s;ht Laws, and though an Order of Men, that have turned the World up&s;ide down, have great Credit
<PB N="25" REF="116"> with him, yet it is hitherto vi&s;ible that they cannot carry it &s;o far, as to make him do any thing contrary to the e&s;tabli&s;hed Religion; and to tho&s;e &s;acred pro|mi&s;es that he made his Subjects. For he makes it appear to all the World that he does not con|&s;ider tho&s;e as &s;o many words &s;poken at fir&s;t to lay his people a&s;leep, which he may now explain and ob&s;erve as he thinks fit; but as &s;o many ties upon his Con&s;cience and Honour, which he will Religiou&s;ly ob&s;erve. And as in the other parts of his life he has &s;et a Noble Pattern to all the Princes of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;o his exactne&s;s to his pro|mi&s;es, is that which cannot be too much com|mended: of which this extraordinary In&s;tance has been communicated to me &s;ince I am come into this Countrey. The Elector had a Proce&s;&s;ion in his Court la&s;t <HI>Corpus Chri&s;ti</HI> day, upon which one of the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Heidelberg</HI> preacht a very &s;e|vere Sermon again&s;t Popery, and in particular, taxed that Proce&s;&s;ion, perhaps, with greater plain|ne&s;s than di&s;cretion: This being brought to the Elector's ears, he &s;ent pre&s;ently an Order to the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Senate to &s;u&s;pend him. That Court is compo&s;ed of &s;ome Secular Men, and &s;ome Churchmen, and as the Princes authority is dele|gated to them, &s;o they have a &s;ort of an Epi&s;|copal juri&s;diction over all the Clergy. This Or|der was a &s;urpri&s;e to them as being a direct breach upon their Laws and the Liberty of their Reli|gion? &s;o they &s;ent a Deputation to Court, to let the Elector know the rea&s;ons that hindred them from obeying his Orders, which were heard with &s;o much Ju&s;tice and Gentlene&s;s, that their Prince in&s;tead of expre&s;&s;ing any di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t them, recalled the Order that he had &s;ent them. The way from <HI>Heidelberg</HI> to <HI>Frankfort,</HI> is, for the fir&s;t twelve or fifteen miles, the beautifulle&s;t piece of ground that can be imagined; for we went
<PB N="26" REF="117"> under a ridge of little Hills that are all covered with Vines, and from them, as far as the eye can go, there is a beautiful Plain of Corn-fields and Meadows, all &s;weetly divided and inclo&s;ed with rows of Trees, &s;o that I fancied I was in <HI>Lom|bardy</HI> again, but with this advantage, that here all was not of a piece, as it is in <HI>Lombardy:</HI> but the Hills as they made a plea&s;ant inequality in the pro&s;pect, &s;o they made the Air purer, and pro|duced a plea&s;ant Wine: The way near <HI>Darm&s;tat,</HI> and all forwards to <HI>Frankfort,</HI> becometh more wild and more &s;andy: There is a good Suburb on the <HI>South-&s;ide</HI> of the <HI>Main</HI> over again&s;t <HI>Frankfort,</HI> which hath a very con&s;iderable Fortification; there is a double Wall, and a double Ditch that goeth round it, and the outward Wall, as it is regularly fortified, &s;o it is faced with Brick to a con&s;idera|ble heighth. The Town of <HI>Frankfort</HI> is of a great extent, and &s;eemed to be but about a third part le&s;s then <HI>Strasburg:</HI> The three Religions are al&s;o to|lerated there; and though the number of the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> is very incon&s;iderable, yet they have the great Church, which is a huge rude building; they have al&s;o &s;eve|ral other Churches, and &s;ome Convents there. There are &s;everal open &s;quares for Market places, and the Hou&s;es about them look very well without. A|mong their Archives they pre&s;erve the Original of the <HI>Bulla Aurea,</HI> which is only a great Parchment writ in <HI>High Dutch,</HI> without any beauty an&s;wering to its Title: and &s;ince I could not have under&s;tood it, I was not at the pains of de&s;iring to &s;ee it, for that is not obtained without difficulty. The <HI>Luthe|rans</HI> have here built a new Church, called St. <HI>Cathe|rin</HI>'s, in which there is as much painting as ever I &s;aw in any <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Church, and over the high Altar there is an huge carved Crucifix, as there are painted ones in other places of their Church. The Pulpit is extream fine of Marble of different colours very
<PB N="27" REF="117"> well poli&s;hed and joyned. I was here at a Sermon where I under&s;tood nothing, but I liked one thing that I &s;aw both at <HI>Strasburg</HI> and here, that at the end of Prayers, there was a con&s;iderable interval of &s;ilence left, before the conclu&s;ion, for all peo|ples private devotions. In the Hou&s;e of their pub|lick Di&s;cipline, they retain &s;till the old <HI>Roman Pi&s;tri|na</HI> or Hand-mill, at which lewd Women are con|demned to grind, that is, to drive about the Wheel that maketh the Mil&s;tones go. There is a great num|ber of <HI>Jews</HI> there, though their two Synagogues are very little, and by con&s;equence the numbers be|ing great, they are very na&s;ty. I was told they were in all above twelve hundred. The Women had the mo&s;t of a tawdry Imbroidery of Gold and Sil|ver about them that ever I &s;aw, for they had all Mantles of Crape, and both about the top and the bottom, there was a border above a hand breadth of imbroidery. The Fortification of <HI>Frank|fort</HI> is con&s;iderable, their Ditch is very broad, and very full of Water; all the Ba&s;tions have a Coun|ter-mine that runneth along by the brim of the Ditch; but the Counter&s;carp is not faced with Brick as the Walls are, and &s;o in many places it is in an ill condition; the covered Way and <HI>glacy</HI> are al&s;o in an ill ca&s;e: The Town is rich, and dri|veth a great Trade, and is very plea&s;antly &s;cituated. Not far from hence is <HI>Hockam</HI> that yieldeth the be&s;t Wine of tho&s;e parts. Since I took <HI>Frankfort</HI> in my way from <HI>Heidelberg</HI> to <HI>Mentz,</HI> I could not pa&s;s by <HI>Worms,</HI> for which I was &s;orry. I had a great mind to &s;ee that place where <HI>Luther</HI> made his fir&s;t appearance before the Emperor, and the Diet, and in that &s;olemn audience expre&s;&s;ed an undaunt|ed zeal for that Glorious Cau&s;e in which God made him &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ed In&s;trument. I had another piece of Curio&s;ity on me which will, perhaps, appear to you &s;omewhat ridiculous. I had a mind to &s;ee a
<PB N="28" REF="118"> Picture that, as I was told, is over one of the <HI>Po|pi&s;h</HI> Altars there, which one would think was In|vented by the Enemies of Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation to make it appear ridiculous. There is a Windmill, and the Virgin throws <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> into the Hopper, and he comes out at the eye of the Milne all in Wa|ters, which &s;ome Prie&s;ts take up to give the Peo|ple. This is &s;o cour&s;e an Embleme, that one would think it too gro&s;s even for <HI>Laplanders;</HI> but a Man that can &s;wallow Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation it &s;elf, will dige&s;t this likewi&s;e. <HI>Mentz</HI> is very nobly &s;cituated, on a ri&s;ing ground a little below the conjunction of the two Rivers, the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and the <HI>Main;</HI> it is of too great a compa&s;s, and too ill Peopled to be capable of a great defence: There is a Cittadel up|on the highe&s;t part of the Hill that commandeth the Town; it is compa&s;&s;ed about with a dry Ditch that is con&s;iderably deep. The Walls of the Town are faced with Brick and regularly forti|fied, but the Counter&s;carp is not faced with Brick, &s;o all is in a &s;ad condition; and the Fortification is weake&s;t on that &s;ide where the Elector's Palace is. There is one &s;ide of a new Palace very nobly built in a regular Architecture, only the <HI>Germans</HI> do &s;till retain &s;omewhat of the <HI>Gothick</HI> manner. It is of a great length, and the de&s;ign is to build quite round the Court, and then it will be a ve|ry magnificent Palace, only the Stone is red; for all the Quarries that are upon the <HI>Rhine,</HI> from <HI>Bazile</HI> down to <HI>Coblentz,</HI> are of red Stone, which doth not look beautiful. The Elector of <HI>Mentz</HI> is an ab&s;olute Prince; his Subjects pre&s;ent Li&s;ts of their Magi|&s;trates to him, but he is not tied to them, and may name whom he will: The Ancient Demea&s;ne of the Electorate is about Forty thou&s;and Crowns: But the Taxes ri&s;e to about Three hundred thou|&s;and Crowns; &s;o that the Subjects here are as heavily taxed as in the <HI>Palatinate:</HI> There is
<PB N="29" REF="118"> Twelve thou&s;and Crowns a year given the Ele|ctor for his privy Pur&s;e, and the State bears the re&s;t of his whole expence: It can Arm Ten thou|&s;and Men, and there is a Gari&s;on of Two thou|&s;and Men in <HI>Mentz:</HI> This Elector hath three Councels, one as he is Chancellour of the Em|pire, con&s;i&s;ting of three Per&s;ons; the other two are for the Policy and Ju&s;tice of his Principali|ty. He and his Chapter have Months by turns for the Nomination of the Prebends. In the Month of <HI>January</HI> he names, if any dies, and they chu&s;e in the Room of &s;uch as die in <HI>February,</HI> and &s;o all the Year round. The Prebendaries or <HI>Dome|heer's</HI> have about Three thou&s;and Crowns a year a piece. When the Elector dieth, the Emperor &s;endeth one to &s;ee the Election made, and he re|commendeth one, but the Canons may chu&s;e whom they plea&s;e; and the pre&s;ent Elector was not of the Emperors recommendation. Be&s;ides the Palace at <HI>Mentz,</HI> the Elector hath another near <HI>Frankfort,</HI> which is thought the be&s;t that is in tho&s;e parts of <HI>Germany:</HI> The Cathedral is a huge <HI>Gothick</HI> Building; there is a great <HI>Cupulo</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t-end,</HI> and there the Quire &s;ingeth Ma&s;s: I could not learn whether this was done only be|cau&s;e the place here was of greater reception than at the <HI>Ea&s;t-end</HI> or if any burying place and en|dowment obliged them to the <HI>We&s;t-end.</HI> Near the Cathedral there is a huge Chapel of great Antiqui|ty, and on the <HI>North</HI> Door there are two great Bra&s;s Gates with a long In&s;cription, which I had not time to write out, but I found it was in the Emperor <HI>Lotharius</HI>'s time. There are a va&s;t num|ber of Churches in this Town, but it is poor and ill inhabited. The <HI>Rhine</HI> here is almo&s;t half an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> mile broad, and there is a Bridge of Boats laid over it. From <HI>Mentz</HI> all along to <HI>Bac|charach</HI> (which &s;eems to carry its name <HI>(Bacchi
<PB N="30" REF="119"> Ara)</HI> from &s;ome famous Altar that the <HI>Romans</HI> probably erected by rea&s;on of the good Wine that grows in the neighbourhood.) There is a great number of very con&s;iderable Villages on both &s;ides of the River: Here the Rats Tower is &s;hewed, and the People of the Country do all firmly be|lieve the &s;tory of the Rats eating up an Elector, and that though he Fled to this I&s;land where he built a &s;mall high Tower, they pur&s;ued him &s;till, and &s;wimmed after him, and eat him up: And they told us that there were &s;ome of his Bones to be &s;een &s;till in the Tower. This extraordinary Death makes me call to mind a peculiar and un|looked for &s;ort of Death, that carried off a poor Labourer off the ground a few days before I left <HI>Geneva.</HI> The foot of one of his Cattel, as he was ploughing, went into a ne&s;t of Wa&s;ps, upon which the whole &s;warm came out, and &s;et upon him that held the Plough, and killed him in a ve|ry little time; and his body was prodigiou&s;ly &s;wel|led with the poy&s;on of &s;o many Stings.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Rhine,</HI> all the way from <HI>Baccharach</HI> down to <HI>Coblents,</HI> there is on both &s;ides of the River hanging grounds, or little Hills, &s;o laid as if many of them had been laid by Art, which produce the rich <HI>Rheni&s;h</HI> Wine: They are indeed as well expo&s;ed to the Sun, and covered from Storms, as can be imagined; and the ground on tho&s;e Hills, which are in &s;ome places of a con&s;ider|able heighth, is &s;o cultivated that there is not an inch lo&s;t that is capable of improvement, and this bringeth &s;o much wealth into the Country, that all along there is a great number of con&s;iderable Villa|ges. <HI>Coblentz</HI> is the &s;tronge&s;t place that I &s;aw of all that belong to the Empire; the &s;cituation is Noble, the <HI>Rhine</HI> running before it, and the <HI>Mo&s;elle</HI> pa&s;&s;ing along the &s;ide of the Town; it is well fortified, the Ditch is large, the Counter&s;carp is high, and the
<PB N="31" REF="119"> covered way is in a good condition; both Walls and Counter&s;carp are faced with Brick, and there are Ravelines before the Cortines; but on the &s;ide of the <HI>Mo&s;elle</HI> it is very &s;lightly fortified, and there is no Fort at the end of the &s;tone Bridge that is laid over the <HI>Mo&s;elle,</HI> &s;o that it lieth quite open on that &s;ide, which &s;eemeth a &s;trange defect in a place of that con&s;equence: But though the Fortifications of this place are very con&s;iderable, yet its chief defence li|eth in the Fort of <HI>Herman&s;tan,</HI> which is built on the top of a very high Hill, that lieth on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine;</HI> and which commandeth this place &s;o ab&s;olutely, that he who is Ma&s;ter of <HI>Herman&s;tan,</HI> is always Ma&s;ter of <HI>Coblentz.</HI> This belongeth to the Elector of <HI>Triers,</HI> who&s;e Palace lieth on the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI>-&s;ide of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> ju&s;t at the foot of the Hill of <HI>Her|man&s;tan,</HI> and over again&s;t the point where the <HI>Mo|&s;elle</HI> falleth into the <HI>Rhine,</HI> &s;o that nothing can be more plea&s;antly &s;cituated; only the ground begins to ri&s;e ju&s;t at the back of the Hou&s;e with &s;o much &s;teepne&s;s that there is not Room for Gardens or Walks. The Hou&s;e maketh a great &s;hew upon the River, but we were told that the Apartments with|in were not an&s;werable to the out&s;ide. I &s;ay we were told for the <HI>German</HI> Princes keep &s;uch forms, that, without a great deal of ado, one cannot come within their Courts, unle&s;s it be when they are a|broad them&s;elves; &s;o that we neither got within the Palace at <HI>Mentz,</HI> nor this of <HI>Herman&s;tan.</HI> It is but a few Hours from this to <HI>Bonne,</HI> where the Elector of <HI>Collen</HI> keepeth his Court; the place hath a regu|lar Fortification, the Walls are faced with Brick; but though the Ditch, which is dry, is pretty broad, the Counter&s;carp is in &s;o ill a condition, that it is not able to make a great defence. This Elector is the Noble&s;t born, and the be&s;t provided of all the <HI>German</HI> Clergy, for he is Brother to the great <HI>Maxi|milian</HI> Duke of <HI>Bavaria;</HI> and be&s;ides <HI>Collen,</HI> he hath
<PB N="32" REF="120"> <HI>Liege, Mun&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Hidel&s;heim,</HI> which are all great Bi&s;hopricks: He hath been al&s;o Six and Thirty years in the <HI>Electorate:</HI> His Palace is very mean, con&s;i&s;t|ing but of one Court, the half of which is ca&s;t into a little Garden, and the Wood-yard is in the very Court; the lower part of the Court was a &s;table; but he hath made an apartment here that is all fur|ni&s;hed with Pictures: where, as there are &s;ome of the hands of the greate&s;t Ma&s;ters, &s;o there are a great many foils to &s;et the&s;e off, that are &s;carce good e|nough for Signpo&s;ts.</P>
<P>The Elector has a great many gold meddals, which will give me occa&s;ion to tell you one of the Extrava|gante&s;t pieces of forgery that perhaps ever was; which happened to be found out at the la&s;t &s;iege of <HI>Bonne:</HI> for while they were clearing the ground for planting a battery, they di&s;covered a Vault in which there was an Iron Che&s;t that was full of meddals of gold to the value of 100000 Crowns; and of which I was told the Elector bought to the value of 30000 Crowns. They are huge big, one weighed 800. Ducats, and the gold was of the finene&s;s of Ducat gold; but though they bore the Impre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Ro|man</HI> Meddals, or rather Medallions they were all Counterfeit; and the imitation was &s;o cour&s;ely done that one mu&s;t be extream Ignorant in Meddals to be deceived by them. Some few that &s;eemed true were of the late <HI>Greek</HI> Emperours. Now it is very unac|countable what could induce a Man to make a forge|ry upon &s;uch mettle, and in &s;o va&s;t a quantity, and then to bury all this under ground, e&s;pecially in an Age in which &s;o much gold was ten times the value of what is at pre&s;ent for it is judged to have been done about Four or Five Hundred Years ago.</P>
<P>The Prince went out a hunting while we were there, with a very hand&s;ome Guard of about Four|&s;core Hor&s;e, well mounted; &s;o we &s;aw the Palace, but where not &s;uffered to &s;ee the Apartment where
<PB N="33" REF="120"> he lodged: There is a great Silver Ca&s;olette gilt, all &s;et with Emeralds and Rubies, that though they made a fine appearance, yet were a Compo&s;ition of the Princes own making: His Officers al&s;o &s;hewed us a Ba&s;on and Ewer, which they &s;aid were of Mercury fixed by the Prince him&s;elf; but they added that now for many Years he wrought no more in his Laboura|tory. I did not ea&s;ily believe this, and as the weight of the Plate did not approach to that of Quick-Sil|ver, &s;o the Medicinal Virtues of fixed Mercury, if there is any &s;uch thing, are &s;o extraordinary, that it &s;eemed very &s;trange to &s;ee Twenty or Thirty Pound of it made up in two pieces of Plate. A quarter of a mile without the Town, the be&s;t Garden of tho&s;e parts of <HI>Germany</HI> is to be &s;een, in which there is a great variety of Water-works, and very many Noble Allies in the <HI>French</HI> manner, and the whole is of a very con&s;iderable extent; but as it hath no Statues of any value to adorn it, &s;o the Hou&s;e about which it lieth in, is in ruines: and it is &s;trange to &s;ee that &s;o rich and &s;o great a Prince, during &s;o long a Regence, hath done &s;o little to Enlarge or beautifie his Buil|dings. <HI>Bonne</HI> and <HI>Coblentz</HI> are both poor and &s;mall Towns. <HI>Collen</HI> is three Hours di&s;tant from <HI>Bonne,</HI> it is of a prodigious extent, but ill built and wor&s;e Peopled in the remote parts of it; and as the Walls are all in an ill ca&s;e, &s;o it is not po&s;&s;ible to fortifie &s;o va&s;t a compa&s;s as this Town maketh, as it ought to be, without a charge that would eat out the whole Wealth of this little State. The <HI>Jews</HI> live in a little Suburb on the other &s;ide of the River, and may not come over without leave obtained, for which they pay con&s;iderably. There is no exerci&s;e of the <HI>Pro|te&s;tant</HI> Religion &s;uffered within the Town, but tho&s;e of the Religion are &s;uffered to live there, and they have a Church at two miles di&s;tance. The Ar&s;enal here, is &s;uitable to the Fortifications, very mean, and ill furni&s;hed. The Quire of the great Church is as
<PB N="34" REF="121"> high in the roof, as any Church I ever &s;aw; but it &s;eemeth the Wealth of this place could not fini&s;h the whole Fabrick, &s;o as to an&s;wer the heighth of the Quire, for the Body of the Church is very low: Tho&s;e that are di&s;po&s;ed to believe Legends, have enough here to over&s;et even a good degree of credu|lity, both in the &s;tory of the three Kings, who&s;e Chap|pel is vi&s;ited with great devotion, and &s;tandeth at the Ea&s;t end of the great Quire; and in that more copious Fable of the Eleven Thou&s;and <HI>&V;r&s;ulins,</HI> who&s;e Church is all over full of rough Tombs, and of a va&s;t number of Bones that are piled up in rows about the Walls of the Church: The&s;e Fables are &s;o firmly believed by the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> there, that the lea&s;t &s;ign which one giveth of doubting of their truth, pa&s;&s;eth for an infallible mark of an Heretick. The <HI>Je&s;uites</HI> have a great and noble Colledge and Church here. And for <HI>Thauler</HI>'s &s;ake I went to the <HI>Dominicans</HI> Hou&s;e and Church; which is al&s;o very great. One grows extreamly weary of walking over this great Town, and doth not find enough of entertainment in it: The pre&s;ent &s;ubject of their di&s;cour&s;e is al&s;o very melancholy: The late Rebellion that was there, is &s;o generally known, that I need not &s;ay much concerning it. A report was &s;et about the Town, by &s;ome Incendia|ries, that the Magi&s;trates did eat up the publick Re|venue, and were like to ruine the City; I could not learn what ground there was for the&s;e reports, for it is not ordinary to &s;ee reports of that kind fly, through a body of Men, without &s;ome foundation: It is certain this came to be &s;o generally believed, that there was a horrible di&s;order occa&s;ioned by it: The Magi&s;trates were glad to &s;ave them&s;elves from the &s;torm, and abandoned the Town to the popular fury, &s;ome of them having been made &s;acrifices to it; and this rage held long: But within this la&s;t year, after near two years di&s;order, tho&s;e that were &s;ent by the Emperor and Diet to Judge the matter,
<PB N="35" REF="121"> having threatned to put the Town under the <HI>Imperial</HI> Bann, if it had &s;tood longer out, were received; and have put the Magi&s;trates again in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Authority, and all the chief Incendiaries were clapt in Pri&s;on: many have already &s;uffered, and a great many more are &s;till in Pri&s;on; they told us that &s;ome executions were to be made within a week when we were there. <HI>Du&s;&s;eldorp</HI> is the fir&s;t con&s;ide|rable Town below <HI>Collen,</HI> it is the Seat of the Duke of <HI>Juliers,</HI> who is Duke of <HI>Newburgh,</HI> elde&s;t Son to the pre&s;ent <HI>Elector Palatine.</HI> The Palace is old and <HI>Gothick</HI> enough; but the <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> have their a fine Colledge, and a noble Chappel, though there are manife&s;t faults in the Architecture; the <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Re|ligion is tolerated and they have a Church lately built here within the&s;e few years, that was procu|red by the interce&s;&s;ion of the Elector of <HI>Branden|burgh.</HI> who ob&s;erving exactly the liberty of Religion that was agreed to in <HI>Cleve,</HI> had rea&s;on to &s;ee the &s;ame as duly ob&s;erved in his Neighborhood, in fa|vour of his own Religion. The Fortification here is very ordinary, the Ramparts being faced but a few foot high with Brick. But <HI>Kei&s;er&s;wart,</HI> &s;ome hours lower on the &s;ame &s;ide, which belongeth to the Ele|ctor of <HI>Collen,</HI> though it is a much wor&s;e Town then <HI>Du&s;&s;eldorp,</HI> yet is much better fortified; it hath a ve|ry broad Ditch, and a very regular Fortification; the Walls are con&s;iderably high, faced with Brick, and &s;o is the Counter&s;carp, which is al&s;o in a very good condition. The Fortification of <HI>Or&s;oy</HI> is now quite demoli&s;hed. <HI>Rhineberg</HI> continueth as it was, but the Fortification is very mean, only of Earth, &s;o that it is not capable of making a great re&s;i&s;tance. And <HI>We&s;el,</HI> though it is a very fine Town, yet is a very poor Fortification, nor can it ever be made good, except at a va&s;t expence; for the ground all about it being &s;andy, nothing can be made there that will be durable, unle&s;s the foundation go very deep, or that
<PB N="36" REF="122"> it be laid upon Piloty. In all the&s;e Towns one &s;ees another air of Wealth and Abundance than in much richer Countries that are exhau&s;ted with taxes. <HI>Rees</HI> and <HI>Emmerick</HI> are good Towns, but the Fortifications are quite ruined. So that here is a rich and populous Country, that hath at pre&s;ent very little defence, ex|cept what it hath from its &s;cituation. <HI>Cleve</HI> is a de|licious place, the &s;cituation and pro&s;pect are charm|ing, and the Air is very pure, and from thence we came hither in three hours.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay one word of the Country into which I am now come, for as I know that is needle&s;s to you on many accounts, &s;o a Picture that I &s;ee here in the Stadthou&s;e, puts me in mind of the perfecte&s;t Book of its kind that is perhaps in being, For Sir <HI>William Temple,</HI> who&s;e Picture hangeth here at the upper end of the Plenipotentiaries that negotiated the Famous Treaty of <HI>Nimmegen,</HI> hath indeed &s;et a pattern to the World, which is done with &s;uch life, that it may ju&s;tly make others blu&s;h to copy after it, &s;ince it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that if we had as perfect an ac|count of the other places, as he hath given us of one of the lea&s;t, but yet one of the Noble&s;t parcels of the Univer&s;e, Travelling would become a needle&s;s thing, unle&s;s it were for diver&s;ion; &s;ince one findeth no fur|ther occa&s;ion for his curio&s;ity in this Country, then what is fully &s;atisfied by his rare performance. Yet I cannot give overwriting, without reflecting on the re&s;i&s;tance that this place made, when &s;o many other places were &s;o ba&s;ely delivered up, though one doth not &s;ee in the ruines of the Fortification here, how it could make &s;o long a re&s;i&s;tance: yet it was that that &s;tem'd the tide of a progre&s;s that made all the World &s;tand amazed; and it gave a little time to the Dutch to recover them&s;elves out of the con&s;terna|tion, into which &s;o many blows, that came &s;o thick one after another, had &s;truck them.</P>
<P>But then the World &s;aw a change, that though it
<PB N="37" REF="122"> hath not had &s;o much Incen&s;e given to it, as the hap|py conjuncture of another Prince hath drawn after it, with &s;o much exce&s;s, that all the topicks of flat|tery &s;eem exhau&s;ted by it, yet will appear to po&s;te|rity one of the mo&s;t &s;urprizing Scenes in Hi&s;tory, and that which may be well matched with the recovery of the <HI>Roman</HI> State after the Battel of <HI>Canne.</HI> When a young Prince, that had never before born Arms, or &s;o much as &s;een a Campagne, who had little or no Council about him but that which was &s;ugge&s;ted from his own thoughts, and that had no extraordi|nary advantage, by his Education either for litera|ture or affairs, was of a &s;udden &s;et at the head of a State and Army, that was &s;unk with &s;o many lo&s;&s;es; and that &s;aw the be&s;t half of its Soil torn from it; and the powerfulle&s;t Enemy in the World, &s;urround|ed with a Victorious Army that was commanded by the be&s;t Generals that the Age hath produced, come within &s;ight, and &s;ettle his Court in one of the be&s;t Towns, and had at the &s;ame time the greate&s;t force both by Sea and Land, that hath been known, united together for its de&s;truction. When the Inhabitants were forced, that they might &s;ave them&s;elves from &s;o formidable an Enemy, to let loo&s;e that which on all other occa&s;ions, is the mo&s;t dreadful to them; and to drown &s;o great a part of their Soil for the pre&s;er|vation of the re&s;t; and to complicate together all the mi&s;eries that a Nation can dread, when to the general con&s;ternation with which &s;o di&s;mal a Scene po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, a di&s;traction within doors &s;eemed to threaten them with the la&s;t &s;trokes; and while their Army was &s;o ill di&s;ciplined, that they dur&s;t &s;carce promi&s;e them&s;elves any thing from &s;uch feeble Troops, after a Peace at Land of almo&s;t Thirty Years continu|ance; and while their chief Ally, that was the mo&s;t concerned in their pre&s;ervation, was, like a great paralitick body, liker to fall on tho&s;e that it pretend|ed to &s;upport, and to cru&s;h them, then to give them
<PB N="38" REF="123"> any con&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;tance: When I &s;ay a young Prince came at the head of all this, the very pro&s;pect of which would have quite dampt an ordinary courage, he very quickly changed the Scene, he animated the Publick Councils with a generous vigour; he found them &s;inking into a feeblene&s;s of hearkning to Propo|&s;itions for a peace, that were as little &s;afe as they were honorable, but he di&s;po&s;ed them to re&s;olve on ha|zarding all, rather than to &s;ubmit to &s;uch Infamous terms. His credit al&s;o among the populace &s;eemed to In&s;pire them with a new life; they ea&s;ily per&s;uaded them&s;elves that as one WILLIAM Prince of ORANGE had formed their State, &s;o here another of the &s;ame name &s;eemed marked out to recover and pre&s;erve it. It was this Spirit of Courage which he derived from his own brea&s;t, and infu&s;ed into the whole People, as well as into the Magi&s;tracy that pre&s;erved this Coun|try. Some thing there was in all this that was Divine. The Publick Councils were again &s;etled, and the Peo|ple were at quiet when they &s;aw him ve&s;ted with a full authority for that time with Relation to peace and war, and concluded they were &s;afe, becau&s;e they were in his hands. It &s;oon appeared how faith|fully he pur&s;ued the Intere&s;t of his Country, and how little he regarded his own. He rejected all Propo&s;i|tions of Peace that were hurtfull to his Country, without &s;o much as con&s;idering the advantages that were offered to him&s;elf, (in which you know that I write upon &s;ure grounds.) He refu&s;ed the offer of the Soveraign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">y of its Chief City, that was made to him by a &s;olemn Deputation, being &s;atisfied with that Authority which had been &s;o long maintained by his Ance&s;tors with &s;o much glory, and being ju&s;tly &s;en&s;i|ble, how much the breaking in upon e&s;tabli&s;hed laws and liberties, is fatal even to tho&s;e that &s;eem to get by it. He thus began his publick appearance on the &s;tage, with all the di&s;advantages that a Spirit a&s;piring to true Glory could wi&s;h for; &s;ince it was Vi&s;ible that
<PB N="39" REF="123"> he had nothing to tru&s;t to, but a good cau&s;e, a favo|rable Providence, and his own Integrity and Courage; nor was &s;ucce&s;s wanting to &s;uch Noble beginnings; for he in a &s;hort time, with a Conduct and Spirit be|yond any thing that the World hath yet &s;een, reco|vered this State, out of &s;o de&s;perate a di&s;temper, took &s;ome places by main force, and obliged the Enemy to abandon all that they had acquired in &s;o feeble a man|ner. And if a raw Army had not always &s;ucce&s;s a|gain&s;t more numerous and better trained Troops, and if the want of Magazins and Stores in their Alli&eacute;s Country, which was the chief Scene of the War, made that he could not Po&s;t his Army, and wait for favourable circum&s;tances, &s;o that he was &s;ometimes forced to run to action, with a ha&s;t that his nece&s;&s;ities impo&s;ed upon him; yet the forcing of the beginnings of a Victory out of the hands of the greate&s;t General of the Age, the facing a great Monarch with an Army much inferior to his, when the other was too cautious to hazard an ingagement, and in &s;hort the forming the <HI>Dutch</HI> Army to &s;uch a pitch that it became vi&s;ibly Su|perior to the <HI>French,</HI> that &s;eemed to have been fed with Conque&s;ts; and the continuing the War, till the Prince that had &s;acrificed the quiet of <HI>Europe</HI> to his GLORY, was glad to come and treat for a Peace in the Enemies Country, and in this very place, and to &s;et all Engines on work to obtain that, by the media|tion of &s;ome, and the jealou&s;ies of other Princes; all the&s;e are &s;uch performances that po&s;terity will be di&s;|po&s;ed to rank them rather among the <HI>Idea</HI>'s of what an imaginary Hero could do, then with what could be really tran&s;acted in &s;o &s;hort a time, and in &s;uch a manner. And in conclu&s;ion every place that belong|ed to the&s;e States, and to their Neighbours along the <HI>Rhine,</HI> together with a great many in <HI>Flanders,</HI> being re&s;tored; the&s;e Provinces do now &s;ee them&s;elves under his happy Conduct, re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in their former peace and &s;ecurity. And though &s;ome &s;cars of &s;uch
<PB N="40" REF="124"> deep wounds do &s;till remain, yet they find them&s;elves con&s;idered on all hands, as the Bulwark of <HI>Chri&s;ten|dom,</HI> again&s;t the fears of a new Monarchy, and as the pre&s;ervers of the peace and liberty of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Here is a Harve&s;t, not for forced Rhetorick, or fal&s;e Eloquence, but for a &s;evere and &s;incere Hi&s;torian, capable of affording a work that will far exceed all tho&s;e lu&s;cious Panegyricks of mercenary pens; but a &s;mall or a Counterfeit Jewel mu&s;t be &s;et with all po&s;|&s;ible advantages, when a true one of great value needs only to be &s;hewed. I cannot end with a greater &s;ub|ject, and I mu&s;t acknowledge my &s;elf to be &s;o inflam|ed with this hint, that as I cannot after this bring my pen down to lower matters, &s;o I dare not tru&s;t my &s;elf too long, to the heat that &s;o Noble an Object in&s;pires, therefore I break off abruptly.</P>

<P>The &s;ame learned Per&s;on has &s;ince my fir&s;t conver|&s;ation with him upon this &s;ubject, &s;ugge&s;ted to me two pa&s;&s;ages of <HI>Fe&s;tus Pompeius,</HI> that &s;eem to deter|mine this whole matter; and that tell us by what names tho&s;e <HI>Catacombs</HI> were known in the <HI>Roman</HI> time, where abouts they were, and what &s;ort of Per&s;ons were laid in them, we have al&s;o the de&s;ignation by which the bearers were commonly known, and the time when they carried out the dead bodies; and it appears particularly by them that in the repo&s;itories of which that author makes mention, there was no care taken to pre&s;erve the bodies that were laid in them from rotting. His words are. <HI>Puticulos anti|qui&s;&s;imum genus &s;epulturae appellatos, quod ibi in puteis &s;e|pelirenter homines: qualis fuerit locus quo nunc cadavera projici &s;olent, extra portam E&s;quilinam; quos quod ibi pute&s;cerent, inde prius appellatos exi&s;timat puticulos Ae|lius Gallus, qui ait antiqui moris fui&s;&s;e, ut patres fami|lias in locum publicum extra oppidum mancipia vilia pro|jicerent, atque ita projecta, quod ibi ea pute&s;cerent, no|men e&s;&s;e factum puticuli.</HI> The other pa&s;&s;age runs thus. <HI>Ve&s;pae &amp; Ve&s;pillones dicuntur, qui funerandis corporibus officium gerunt, non &agrave; minutis illis volucribus, &s;ed quia ve&s;pertino tempore eos efferunt, qui funebri pompa duci propter inopiam nequeunt.</HI> All this agrees &s;o exactly to the thoughts that a general view of tho&s;e repo&s;itories give a Man, that it will not be hard to per&s;uade him that tho&s;e burying places that are now graced with the pompous title of Catacombs, are no other then the <HI>Puticoli</HI> mentioned by <HI>Fe&s;tus Pompeius,</HI> where the meane&s;t &s;ort of the <HI>Roman</HI> Slaves were laid, and

<P>I have &s;ince my being in <HI>Naples</HI> in&s;tructed one that was going thither in this particular, and have receiv|ed this account from him; that he had taken care to plumm the water at the furthe&s;t pillar of <HI>Caligula</HI>'s bridge on the <HI>Puzzolo</HI> &s;ide; and found it was &s;even fa|thom and a half deep; but he adds that the Water|men a&s;&s;ured him, that that on the other &s;ide before <HI>Baia</HI> the water was 26. fathom deep; but as he had not a plummet long enough to try that, &s;o he be|lieved a good deal ought to be abated; for the Wa|termen had a&s;&s;ured him that the water was ten fathom deep on the <HI>Puzzolo</HI> &s;ide, though upon tryal he found it was only &s;even and a half; and by this mea&s;ure one may &s;uppo&s;e that the water is 20. fathom deep on the other &s;ide; &s;o that it is one of the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing things that one can think of that pillars of brick could have been built in &s;uch a depth of water.</P>
