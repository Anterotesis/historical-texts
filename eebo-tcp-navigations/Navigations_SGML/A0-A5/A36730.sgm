<HEAD>A SECOND EMBASSY OR APPLICATION TO THE Emperor of China.</HEAD>
<P>_MAny Years are past since several <HI>Europeans,</HI> especially the <HI>English, Spaniards, Portuguese,</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> have with indefatigable Endeavors persever'd towards the acqui|ring a free and unmolested Trade in <HI>CHINA:</HI> Yet though they have variously attempted what might seem probable to this Effect, their whole Undertakings have prov'd little better than a Labor in vain; for the <HI>Chineses</HI> priding in the Subsistance of their own Pro|duct, and too strictly observing an Ancient Law, prohibiting the Admission of any Strangers into their Countrey, excepting such onely as bringing Tributes from the adjacent Borders, paid Homage to their Emperor, as Supreme Lord of the World; or else Foreign Embassadors, under which pretence many drove there a subtile Trade, have shut out and abhorr'd all Correspondency abroad; which <HI>Trigaut</HI> affirms, saying, <HI>The</HI> Chineses <HI>have a Law that forbids Strangers to come amongst them; but if any such be found, the onely Penalty is, That he must dwell there, and never return: Yet these are not suffer'd to go where they please, but limited in the Entries and Out-skirts of the Empire, mov'd by a Superstitious Fear, from a Prophecy, That they shall be supplanted by Stran|gers.</HI></P>
<P>But the Interpretation or Suspition extends not onely to remote and un|known People, but their Neighbors, with whom they have some Converse, and use the like Customs, Habits, and Religion; for the <HI>Coreans,</HI> the nearest of their Neighbors, were never seen in <HI>China</HI> but in the condition of Slaves.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Martinius</HI> also, in his <HI>Chinese Atlas,</HI> relates, That <HI>China</HI> is lock'd up so<NOTE PLACE="marg">Histor. Sinic. 65.</NOTE> close and cunningly to keep out all Strangers, that scarce any, unless by way of Embassy, are once suffer'd to come in. The <HI>Turks, Tartars, Moguls,</HI> and
<PB N="2" REF="4">
other adjacent People, address themselves as Embassadors, when indeed are disguis'd Merchants, and so drive there a profitable Trade; for feigning fantastick Names, for several Princes that never were, nor are, present Gifts to the Emperor, which they buy at low Rates; cheap, but fit Commo ties to be transported thither: Nor can they be Losers; for they receive atleast twice the Value as a grateful Return; the Emperor counting it a high disho|nor to do otherwise.</P>
<P>Besides this, all Embassadors, during their stay, going, and coming through the Countrey, are with their whole Retinue maintain'd at the Publick Charge, and their other Goods, whatever, that are not Presents, in stead of Customs and Taxes, are brought on several Carriages, at the Emperors Expence, to the Palace, where they are permitted to expose them to Sale, or Barter: But al|though this care be taken concerning their Expences, and that they shall no way be Losers in making their Addresses to the Court; yet whatever Ambas|sadors they be, though the Negotiation be never so serious, and of greatest im|port; nay, though they come loaden with Treasure, to be pour'd into the Em|perors Exchequer, and be ancient Friends and Allies, yet they are entertain'd like Spies and Enemies, not suffer'd in their Journeys to see the Countreys, but hood-wink'd, have no more Prospect than the Road they tread upon; and in like manner are as close Prisoners, lock'd up in their Inns, and Places of purpose for such Reception; and when come to Court, not onely secur'd, but never permitted to Publick Audience, or to see the Emperor, but manage all their Business by the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> or Officers of State.</P>
<P>Besides, <HI>Trigaut</HI> also tells us, <HI>That they severely punish their own People, that hold any Commerce or Intelligence with Strangers, without especial Licence from the Emperor.</HI> And what is of more remark, If there be occasion to send any Person of Qua|lity forth by way of Envoy or Embassy beyond the Limits of the Empire, it is a Work of difficulty to procure them; but when prevail'd upon by Per|swasions, at his departure all his Acquaintance, Kindred, and Relations lament, as if going to suffer Execution; but at his return he is receiv'd with as much joy, and specially advanc'd by the Emperor; which is no wonder, the <HI>Chineses</HI> having such a reluctancy to whatever seems strange, nay, scorning to learn out of any Books but their own, believing, that all Humane Knowledge is within the Sphere of their Activity, and looking upon all Outlandish as ig|norant Animals, and when they mention them in their Writings, take notice of them no otherwise; for their Characters that spell <HI>Beast,</HI> anagrammatiz'd, signifie <HI>a Stranger,</HI> also stigmatizing them with some Mark or Accent, that may interpret them worse than Devil.</P>
<P>These Orders were more than strictly observ'd towards Strangers, while the <HI>Chineses</HI> were Govern'd by their own Native Princes; but the <HI>Oriental Tar|tars,</HI> which so lately by Conquest are become Masters of the Empire, let loose the Reins of that part of their Ancient Policy, and less scrupulous, are more indifferent, leaving opener Doors to the admittance of Trade and Commerce.</P>
<P>The Chief Council of <HI>New Batavia</HI> still watching all Opportunities for Im|provement of Traffick, being inform'd by Father <HI>Martinius,</HI> That the Con|quering <HI>Tartars,</HI> now setled in <HI>China,</HI> would more readily receive Addresses concerning Trade, than the former <HI>Chinese</HI> Princes, resolv'd to make Tryal thereof, by sending a Vessel laden with several Merchandises from the Island <HI>Tayowan;</HI> to which purpose <HI>Frederick Schedell,</HI> being order'd with a Ship call'd the <HI>Brown-Fish,</HI> from <HI>Tayowan,</HI> came within nine days after his departure from
<PB N="3" REF="4">
thence, to an Anchor in the Mouth of the River <HI>Canton,</HI> near the Island <HI>Hay|tomon.</HI></P>
<P>His Business at first was so well resented, that the Vice-Roys of <HI>Canton</HI> grant|ed him under their Hands Licence to sell and barter the Contents of his <HI>Cargo,</HI> and also to build a Store-house in <HI>Canton,</HI> for their better Accommodation; al|though they were advis'd and perswaded to the contrary by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Sta|ple at <HI>Macao,</HI> who in their Letters to the Vice-Roys gave but a sad Account of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> saying, That they were Traytors and Rebels against their true Prince, scarce having any Countrey of their own, or Religion, but liv'd by Pyracy, robbing and plundering whatever they light upon, either by Sea or Land; hoping by thus decrying their Reputation, to set a stop to their begun Proceedings, and new Factory. In like manner the <HI>Chinese</HI> Philosophers, great Students of their Countreys Antiquities, by the Instigations of the <HI>Portuguese Iesuits,</HI> inform'd also the Vice-Roys, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were a Nation odious, and through all Ages detested by the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and never upon any account had the least admittance into their Empire.</P>
<P>But though this Intelligence did something, yet it had not the expected efficacy, and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had gone on, and carried the Business, when ac|cidentally a great Person coming from the Imperial City <HI>Peking</HI> to <HI>Canton,</HI> first disswaded the Vice-Roys from what they intended therein, saying, It was quite another thing to permit any one free Egress and Regress into their Dominions, than to give them a Place of Residence on the Shore, without the knowledge of the Supreme Authority; but that he ought to acquaint the Emperor there|with, if he intended not to incur his displeasure: Upon which the old Vice-Roy, changing his Determination, civilly sent to <HI>Schedell,</HI> desiring him for that time to depart with all his Company, lest his abiding there so long, might be misconstru'd by his King <HI>Matsuyker,</HI> as a deterring, or some restraint upon them; although <HI>Schedell</HI> urg'd much, that there could be no such cause of mis|trust there, using many Arguments. The Vice-Roys presenting him at his departure, gave him also two Letters to <HI>Nicholas Verburgh</HI> Governor of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> first complementing, and then advising him, that the best and onely way for the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to obtain liberty for setting up a Factory at <HI>Canton,</HI> and licence to Trade in <HI>China,</HI> was by Address to the Emperor, by way of Embassy, carrying rich Presents to the Emperor at <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>The Council at <HI>Batavia,</HI> observing the Advice they receiv'd, would not of themselves undertake so great a business, unless so order'd from their Masters of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company; which asking some time to bring about, they in the mean time resolv'd to venture out another Ship, to try her Fortune at <HI>Can|ton:</HI> To which purpose they chose <HI>Zacharias Wagenaer</HI> a Merchant, and the same <HI>Frederick Schedell,</HI> who with two Ships, the <HI>Brown-Fish,</HI> and <HI>Whiting,</HI> laden with Merchandize, arriv'd a Month after they left <HI>Batavia,</HI> in the Mouth of the River <HI>Canton,</HI> and from thence went to <HI>Wangsoe,</HI> a Village three Leagues from the City.</P>
<P><HI>Wagenaer</HI> at last arriving at <HI>Canton,</HI> deliver'd his Letters from the Council in <HI>Batavia,</HI> by the old Vice-Roys Secretary (having no admission to the Vice-Roy) and receiv'd for Answer, <HI>That since the</HI> Hollanders <HI>had neither brought Letters nor Presents for the Emperor in</HI> Peking, <HI>of which they were expresly advis'd, the more to fa|cilitate their business; therefore lest he should be question'd, he neither would nor could see or speak with them.</HI> So that <HI>Wagenaer</HI> and <HI>Schedell</HI> return'd, having made a fruitless Voyage, without any success, to <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">Soon after they having receiv'd Expresses from the Governors of the <HI>East-India</HI> Company in <HI>Holland,</HI> to set forth an Embassy, according to the Advice of the Vice Roys of <HI>Canton,</HI> sent <HI>Peter de Goyer,</HI> and <HI>Iacob de Keyzer</HI> Embassadors <HI>Peking,</HI> to the Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> with Letters of Credence and Presents, to obtain his Imperial Licence that they might Trade in <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>These Embassadors arriv'd <HI>Anno</HI> 1656. in the Chief City <HI>Peking.</HI> The next day some of the Council, and the Prime Secretary <HI>Thouglauja,</HI> with two other <HI>Tartar Mandarins, Quanlauja,</HI> and <HI>Hoolauja,</HI> came to complement the Embassa|dors in the Emperors Name, to inquire after their Health, the number of their Attendants, concerning what their Presents were, and from whom, and whence they came? To all which Questions, the <HI>Mandarins</HI> receiving particular An|swers, listed all those Persons that attended the Embassy (which according to the Information sent from <HI>Canton</HI> were in all twenty four) which they set down one after another by their several Names; nor did they leave out those Hang|ers on which were not included in the List.</P>
<P>After that, they turn'd and look'd over several Presents; then inquir'd, whence they came, how and who made them, for what use, and in what part of the World? And lastly, How far, or how many Months Sail <HI>Holland</HI> lay distant from <HI>Peking?</HI> To which the Embassadors having return'd fitting An|swers, the <HI>Mandarins</HI> inquir'd further, Whether they were a People that dwelt only upon the Seas, and had no Land-Habitations (which the <HI>Portuguese Iesu|its</HI> put into their Heads) or if they inhabited any Countrey, what they call'd it, and where it lay? From whence, and to what purpose they were sent? What was their Kings Name, and of what Age? All which the Embassadors answer'd. Yet they were not so satisfied; but interrogating, forc'd them to recount the same Answers again. But after they grew more curious, and be|gan to inquire concerning their manner of Government, and if the Embassa|dors were not of the Blood Royal, and of Kin to their Prince: <Q>For no For|reign Embassadors (said they) if they be not of Consanguinity with their King, are admitted to appear, bowing their Heads with all humility, before the Imperial Majesty.</Q></P>
<P>Whereupon the Embassadors reply'd, <Q>That they were not of the Blood Royal; for the manner of their Countrey was not to send Princes of the Blood on such remote Embassies, but imploy'd other Men of good Quali|ty, and well esteem'd at home, upon such Foreign Negotiations.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Mandarins</HI> further inquisitive, came at last to ask, What Offices they bore in their Princes Court? What their Names and Titles of Honor were? How many Men they had under their Command? All which the Embassadors answer'd very punctually.</P>
<P>Then they inquir'd again, If they came directly from <HI>Holland,</HI> or <HI>Batavia?</HI> If from <HI>Batavia,</HI> What kind of Place it was, and what manner of Person the General? Which being resolv'd, the <HI>Mandarins</HI> went away satisfied.</P>
<P>The next day the Embassadors, with the Presents, appear'd by order of the Chancellor before the Council, without which they were not to be admitted; where the Chancellor sate uppermost, on a high Bed, cross-legg'd: Next him, on the right Hand, sate two <HI>Tartar</HI> Lords; and on the left, a <HI>Iesuit</HI> call'd <HI>Adam Schal,</HI> an ancient and venerable Person, and being close shaven, look'd like a <HI>Tartar:</HI> he had dwelt above forty six years, in the several Reigns of <HI>Chinesy</HI> Princes, in the Court at <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>The rest of the Council sate promiscuously, without any Order or State,
<PB N="5" REF="5">
one among another, upon Benches onely cover'd with old white Linnen.</P>
<P>The Chancellor welcoming the Ambassadors in few words, Commanded them to sit; then laying the Presents on a Table, he ask'd upon the matter all the Questions which the <HI>Mandarines</HI> had formerly; whereto the Ambassa|dors, by the help of Father <HI>Adam</HI> their Interpreter there, gave ready An|swers.</P>
<P>Mean while Order came from the Emperor to the Council, wherein the Je|suit was desir'd to write down, and to deliver to his Imperial Majesty that night, if the <HI>Hollanders</HI> possess'd any Land; and also where, and how far it lay distant from his; and also how their Prince was call'd, and what kind of Go|vernment they maintain'd? All which <HI>Schal</HI> deliver'd in Writing to the Chan|cellor: Adding, that their Countrey did formerly belong to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> from whom they keep it unjustly, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But the Chancellor perceiving that the Jesuit had no kindness for them, scrupling, made him put in, and put out, and write the whole matter twice over; then ordering him to Transcribe it fair, he refus'd, excusing himself by age, and weakness of sight; Upon&punc; which, he commanded one of his Un|der-Clerks to write it over; which done, it was immediately with some small Presents carry'd to the Emperor. Who soon after having receiv'd this advice, sent a Mandatory Letter to the Council, signifying, That he receiv'd the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> as Ambassadors, and permitted that they might be brought into his pre|sence, so soon as he should sit upon the Throne in his new Court. The Let|ter to the Council was written in these words:</P>
<P><Q>Most Honorable, and our great Lords, the <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassadors are come hither with their Presents to Complement the Emperor, and shew their obedience to Us, which no Record shews, nor any remembers, that they ever did to this Crown in thousands of years before: Therefore, since this is their first Address, We receive them as Ambassadors, and permit, that they, when We shall sit on Our Imperial Throne, in Our New Palace, may be brought into Our presence, to shew their obedience to Us, that afterwards they may be well entertain'd, and dealt withal according to their own requests, and also be speedily dispatch'd for their better departure; and the rather, because out of respect to Our Fame, they are come an unimaginable vast way by Sea, and also by Land; nay, as if they came out of a shadow from high Mountains, to rest their Feet at <HI>Peking;</HI> there with open Eyes, to behold the clear Sun in the Firmament; therefore how can We with|stand and deny the Requests of such Persons, after their long and tedious Voyages?</Q></P>
<P>But after, when the Ambassadors Letters of Credence, Translated by <HI>Schal,</HI> were read to the Emperor, he sent to the Chancellor a second Order in these words:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Having on the sixteenth day of the sixth Moon read over the <HI>Hollanders</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Stilo vet. 6. Aug. Stilo novo 16. Aug.</NOTE> Letters a second time, and gotten a right understanding thereof, We find that their Embassy which they have undertaken is freely out of their own kind|ness and inclination towards Us, and that from a Countrey lying beyond the great Sea; just like a Bird that takes a voluntary flight through the Air, and cannot be forc'd to come down: And since We esteem this Embassy higher than ought else, and would befriend as Our self, therefore We charge you, Our Chancellor, and the rest of Our Council of State, upon their Re|quests which they shall make by way of this Embassy, to permit them
<PB N="6" REF="6">
egress and regress through Our Empire; and what other Agreements you drive with them, you acquaint Us therewith.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This Letter being read, the Chancellor ask'd the Ambassadors if they could in like manner make annual Addresses, if not, every three year; whereupon the Ambassadors answer'd, That they could with more certainty and Cere|mony wait on the Emperor with their due obeisance in <HI>Peking</HI> every fifth year, so that they might be Licens'd yearly with four Ships to come and Traf|fique at <HI>Canton:</HI> Which Proposal the Chancellor put to the Vote, and the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> with one voice judg'd, their Designs were fit, just, and reasonable: But the <HI>Chineses</HI> thought it sufficient, if they made their Addresses to the Emperor but every ninth year, to save the trouble and danger of so long a Journey, supposing what the <HI>Tartarians</HI> did not observe, that it was not fit the <HI>Hollanders</HI> should Trade all that while at <HI>Canton.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, they urg'd that these that call'd themselves <HI>Hollanders,</HI> might be <HI>English,</HI> neither they nor their Shipping being much unlike, which would be a high scandal upon their Government, to suffer that Nation that had done them such prejudice within memory, when they came but with four Ships into the Haven <HI>Heytamon,</HI> and ruffled their Fleet there, sinking some, and taking others, and so batter'd the Castle, that they took the <HI>Mandarine</HI> himself Prisoner, fight|ing more like Furies than Men, for which they were ever since declar'd Ene|mies, nay, according to an Edict made at that time, never after to be permit|ted to Trade in <HI>China;</HI> so that they ought to have greater proofs, whether the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were not <HI>English,</HI> before they should be suffer'd to Traffique upon their Coasts.</P>
<P>And also (besides that, it was contrary to their ancient Laws and Customs to grant to any Nation a free Trade in the Empire) they could not perceive any thing concerning this Request in their Lettrrs of Credence; therefore, according to their opinion, the Ambassadors went beyond their Orders.</P>
<P>This stop of the Council so unexpected, seem'd very strange to the Ambas|sadors, who thought of nothing more, but that all things had been done, and a free Trade granted, and that they were onely to return him their humble Thanks.</P>
<P>All which was brought thus about by the influence of Father <HI>Adam Schall,</HI> and some other <HI>Portuguese</HI> at <HI>Peking,</HI> foreseeing the undoing of their Factory at <HI>Macao,</HI> if the <HI>Dutch</HI> set up at <HI>Canton,</HI> and also there wanted not a less Sum than 300 Tail of Silver, which was to be dispos'd to Bribe the Council, with pro|mises of more: The <HI>Tartars</HI> also now adding, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> under pretence of Trade, sought to get footing in the Empire, and then to Ransack the Coun|trey, and Pillage, and make Prize of what e're they could lay hold on.</P>
<P>All which was more confirm'd as a positive truth, by the Allegation of a Commissioner that had dwelt at <HI>Canton</HI> three years before; and also by the <HI>Tu|tang</HI>'s Letters, which at that time was at <HI>Canton,</HI> and Brib'd for that purpose by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> at <HI>Macao,</HI> had wrought such an opinion in the Hearts of the Peo|ple, that they look'd upon the <HI>Hollanders</HI> no otherwise than a company of Out|laws and Exiles, which had no home or abodes, but dwelt on the Sea, their whole subsistence drawn from Spoil and Piracy.</P>
<P>Lastly, The Ambassadors found that the Chancellor and other Councellors could not without Bribes understand, that these words in their Letters of Cre|dence, <HI>To have leave to go and come,</HI> could signifie nothing but a free Trade: which seem'd very strange to them, since they knew no otherwise but that the
<PB N="7" REF="6">
five and thirty hundred Tail of Silver, which they had oblig'd themselves to pay to the Vice-Roy at <HI>Canton,</HI> was to be distributed amongst the Council. Therefore being thus deceiv'd by the Vice-Roy, they were forc'd to fall to new Consultations to obtain their desire.</P>
<P>First, They Declar'd to the Chancellor and Council more at large, what was intended by that Point concerning their Annual Trade in <HI>Canton,</HI> and de|sired earnestly to obtain it.</P>
<P>Next they offer'd by the old Vice-Roy of <HI>Cantons Mandarin,</HI> to the Chancel|lor, that they would stay in <HI>Peking,</HI> till his Majesty was fully assur'd, that they were <HI>Hollanders</HI> and not <HI>English.</HI> They also requested, that the Emperor would be pleas'd to give them a Seal, with some peculiar Mark Engrav'd in Brass, therewith they might Seal Passes for all Ships that either Sail'd by, or put into the Harbors of <HI>China,</HI> thereby to distinguish them from others of their neighboring Nations.</P>
<P>At last they exhibited a Proposal, drawn by one of the Clerks of the Coun|cil; wherein they urg'd, that they might as Loyal Subjects Trade in <HI>China,</HI> upon the Grant whereof, they would undertake to pay all Taxes and Customs whatsoever, like those of <HI>Licukieu, Ainan,</HI> and <HI>Siam;</HI> and when those three Na|tions made their Addresses, being every third year, they would in like manner attend the Emperor with peculiar Presents.</P>
<P>But all their Proposals were to no effect, wanting at least ten thousand Tail of Silver, there being no other means in that Court to make their way, for what party Brib'd most, abnubilated their understandings, and gave them a sense of their Cause, which Sum they being then not able to raise, for none could be took up upon any Security whatsoever, under ten, or eight at least <HI>per cent.</HI> a Moneth Interest: Which exaction the Ambassadors judg'd no way fit or rea|sonable, because if they were at this Expence, it lay still doubtful, whether their business should be effected.</P>
<P>The Emperor at last inform'd of all the Proceedings by his Council, and how the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were inclin'd to come in an Embassy to his Majesty, every fifth year; and that they had made it appear, that in less time they could not go and come: Therefore his Majesty, out of a respect to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and for their better accommodation, order'd them to come but every eighth year, <Q>For, said he, otherwise they would not be able to hold out; and why should We lay an unnecessary Obligation on a People which We neither need, nor fear? and who of their own inclination come to tender their. Obedience to Us with Presents? No, We have resolv'd to Treat them so tenderly, that af|ter they have ended their great Journey, they may have two or three years rest at home.</Q></P>
<P>By this Declaration of the Emperor, they saw plainly nothing more was to be done, but to apply themselves onely to patience, and to put off the Design till another more fit opportunity; for the Councils chief Secretary had told them, that too much pressing, and eager sollicitation, would rather hurt than help the Business.</P>
<P>Amongst others, having made their Addresses concerning this matter, by the Vice-Roys of <HI>Cantons Mandarins,</HI> they receiv'd this Answer:</P>
<Q><P>Is it not enough, that at this first time they are admitted as Ambassadors to tender their Presents to the Emperor, and notwithstanding the bad fame which hath rendred them odious in the Eyes of the most eminent Persons in <HI>China,</HI> they were now accepted as Friends, and had leave to dispose of their
<PB N="8" REF="337">
Goods which they had brought; let them not urge too much for a free Trade, lest perhaps for the future they be deny'd all.</P>
<P>They must not think nor imagine that We are oblig'd to grant them all things at first; if they come the next year, or so soon as they can, and with Presents return the Emperor thanks for his kind accepting of them; then perhaps there will be better Conveniencies to effect their desires.</P></Q>
<P>At last the Ambassadors having shew'd due reverence to the Emperor's Seal, appear'd before the Throne, and been at three of the Emperors Feasts, where they were very nobly Entertain'd, receiv'd their Dispatch, together with his Imperial Majesties Letter to his Excellency <HI>Iohn Maetzuiker,</HI> in <HI>New-Batavia.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>The Emperor sends this Letter to the <HI>Netherlanders, Batavia,</HI> and to their King <HI>John Maetzuiker.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Ur Countreys are as far distant as the East from the West, so that We can|not easily visit each other; Many Ages are past since the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have been seen amongst us, but you have done very prudently, in that you sent to Us <HI>Peter de Goeyer,</HI> and <HI>Iacob de Keyser,</HI> which in your Name have brought Us Presents. You have shew'd your good inclination, by remembring Us; wherefore Our heart is also much inclin'd to you; and as a testimony there|thereof, We send you two Rowls of Sattin, four Rowls of Flower'd Sattin, four Rowls of blew Sattin without Flowers, four Rowls of <HI>Kin,</HI> four Rowls of Camlet, ten Pieces of <HI>Peelings,</HI> ten Pieces of <HI>Parsu,</HI> ten Pieces of light Colour'd Stuffs, and three hundred Tail of Silver&punc; You have desir'd to come and Trade in Our Countrey, to bring Commodities thither, and carry others out, by which a private Man might reap good profit: But because your Countrey is so many thousand Leagues distant, and here blow very hard Winds, so that the Ships run great danger which come hither, and for that also it is very cold here ashore, by very great Hails and Snows; it would be no small trouble to Us, if any of your People should come hither and mis|carry; but if this satisfie not, unless they have permission to visit these parts, then let them come every eighth year once, with a hundred in their Train, of which twenty may come to the Palace, where we keep our Imperial Re|sidence; and you may lay your Merchandize ashore in your Store-house, without disposing of them at Sea before <HI>Canton.</HI> This We have thought good out of Our inclination for your benefit, and believe that it will likewise be to your satisfaction. This is that which we intended to advise you.</P>

<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> thus frustrated of their expectation, having obtain'd nothing else than to come every eighth year once, with Merchandize to Trade in the Countrey, left off prosecuting the Design with so much eagerness for a consi|derable time.</P>
<P>But since the loss of the Islands <HI>Tayowan,</HI> and <HI>Formosa,</HI> taken from the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> by <HI>Koxinga,</HI> or <HI>Iquon,</HI> and his Associates, <HI>Anno</HI> 1661. they renew'd their Suit to the <HI>Tartar</HI> for a free Trade, on promise and assurance, that if they

should meet with <HI>Coxinga,</HI> either at Sea or Land, they would endeavor to de|stroy him, as a common Enemy both to the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore since the Isles of <HI>Tayowan, Formosa,</HI> and <HI>Coxinga</HI> will be often made mention of in this our Relation; and that from the loss of those places, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> renew'd their old Request, under pretence of help to ruine the ene|my; it will be necessary, and this our Business seems indeed to require a brief Description of them in the first, and withal, a Relation how <HI>Coxinga</HI> took them from the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of Formosa.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Formosan</HI> Isle, formerly call'd by the <HI>Chineses, Paccande,</HI> extends it self<NOTE PLACE="marg">Description of the Island <HI>Formosa.</HI></NOTE> in length from the South to the North, and in breadth East and West, being an hundred and thirty Leagues in Circuit: the Prospect shews you much rising Ground, and a Hilly Countrey, which abounds with Deer, great store of Wild Goats, Hares, Coneys, Swine, Tygers, and the <HI>Luvasey,</HI> whose flesh hath a delightful and excellent relish. The Woods also have no want of Pheasants and Pigeons. The Ground being fruitful, produceth store of Sugar, Ginger, Cinamon, Coco-Nuts, and several other Necessaries fit for humane sustenance; besides, full of populous Villages. They are Govern'd by several Lords, not de|pending on, nor acknowledging any Superior, so that each Town being a Re|publick, they still have Wars, and are at difference one with another, Town against Town, Village against Village, insomuch that Peace never set Foot in that Isle.</P>
<P>Of their many Villages, the prime and of chiefest note, are <HI>Sinkan, Mandauw, Soulang, Backeloang, Taffacan, Tifulucan, Teopan,</HI> and <HI>Tefurang;</HI> the last in a Valley near the High-lands, where <HI>Fort Zelandia</HI> stands, formerly call'd <HI>Tayovan.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this Village are rude and salvage, robust, and almost of a<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inhabitants of <HI>Tefu|rang</HI> are very salvage.</NOTE> Gigantick size, not black like the <HI>Caffers,</HI> and count it no immodesty to go stark<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Customs.</NOTE> naked. Their Women, well built for Stowage, short, and inclining to gross|ness, wearing Apparel; yet twice a day they strip themselves, and are not asham'd to bathe and wash in publick.</P>
<P>These, though a barbarous People, are kind to the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> heartily en|tertaining them with their own, though mean, yet wholsome Fare.</P>
<P><HI>Soulang</HI> breeds a needy, spiteful, inhospitable, and bloody People. Not|withstanding<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inhabitants of <HI>Soulang.</HI></NOTE> the fruitfulness of the Soil they commonly live in want, being extreme lazy, Tilling no more than they suppose will supply their necessity; which often falling short, they are so hardly put to it, that when they per|ceive Provision growing scant, they live sparingly many days, or else they might be utterly famish'd; for in such exigencies they never help one ano|ther: nay, they are so supinely slothful, that the Women do all the business of the Field, Plough, Sow, and Reap, having neither Horses, nor any other Cat|tel to help them; the Drudgery being the more, because they make it Gard|ners work, for onely with Spades they dig and turn the Glebe; and where their Corn grows thickest, especially Rice, they pluck it out with their Hands, and set it where they find the Blades come up thinner; and in Harvest know|ing neither Scythe nor Sickle, which tries their patience, crop with a Tool like a Pruning Knife, Stalk by Stalk, a Span below the Ear; which with|out Threshing, they store up in their Houses, hanging it in the Evening in
<PB N="10" REF="7">
small Bundles over the Fire; and early in the Morning the Women rise and<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they order their Rice.</NOTE> Pound so much as will serve them that day for their lazy Lord and Family Besides Rice and other Grain, they Sow Carrots, Set Water-Melons, <HI>Pinang, Quach, Taraum,</HI> and <HI>Pting.</HI></P>
<P>This Isle is not stor'd with such Wines as other places in <HI>India</HI> have, which their Trees produce; but they have another sort of Liquor, that inebriates no less than the <HI>Indian,</HI> or Juyce of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Grape; which they prepare in this manner: They take a quantity of Rice, which they put in a Vessel made for that purpose, and boyl it; which turning out, they knead into little Balls, or Pellets; when they are well chew'd, they put them into another Pot, there let|ting it stand till grown sowre; to this they pour a good quantity of Spring-Water, which being so put together, works a Moneth or two, for so long it will ferment; then it becomes a clear, pleasant, wholsom, and strong Li|quor: which the longer kept, the better grows, for it will hold good thir|ty<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Liquor in <HI>Eorme|sa.</HI></NOTE> years. The top of this Drink is thin and clear, the bottom or sedi|ment thick like our Pap: the thin makes their Drink, with which they often Fuddle; the thick makes their Cawdle to recover them, which Crop-sick, they eat with Spoons. This they carry with them to the Field, and take a Dose thereof when they think fit: and thus yearly they spend most part of their Rice.</P>
<P>The Women when their Cultivation or Land-work is done, then they be|take<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Women Fish and Till.</NOTE> themselves to the Sea, and Launch out their Boats, which they call <HI>Cham|pans,</HI> and fall to Fishing, where they catch great store of Crabs, Oysters, and Gurnets, which they Salt without Gutting, and therefore, though Pickled, keep not long, but are apt to putrifie and breed Worms; yet they like it never the worse, but look upon their Dish as the greater Dainty, the rancker the Hogooe.</P>
<P>Their Youths, though strong and of able Bodies, spend their time in idle|ness and sloth; and when forty years old, then they settle themselves to Lazi|ness, as if it were a Trade or Handicraft, spending twenty years in a metho|dical doing of nothing, in a small Hut or Hovel, dandling their Children, or Dalliance with their Wives, seldom or never stirring out of their own Limits, or Patch of Ground, unless invited either to a private or publick Feast, or Hunting-Matches, in which pleasure they take some pains, using several, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several ways of Hunt|ing.</NOTE> indeed ingenious ways to catch the Game, sometimes practising deceit, laying Snares and Traps of complicated Rushes and Reeds so artificially, that they look fresh, as if growing and ungather'd, setting them in the Haunts of wild Boars, Lays of Deers, and the like, and so catch them, wondring who made their new Lodges and Beds so soft, and lay Meshes in other inviting places, which if they take not willingly, nor observe such Allurements, they drive them in, where they also make them their Prey; and they trapan them into Pits, digg'd and spread over with a light Swarth, or Turf of Grass, supported with brittle Twigs laid athwart the Holes: here to make them sure from get|ting out, they place a Snare, which suddenly arrests them, taking them Priso|ners by the Neck or Legs, and then they with a shout fall upon the so taken Quarry.</P>
<P>Besides this, they use Hostility and open Arms, whole Villages march out<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange manner of Hunt|ing in <HI>Firando.</HI></NOTE> together, nay, two or three Townships, joyning their Forces, taking the Field; where drawn out in a single File, they stretch a Ring, which extends four or five <HI>English</HI> Miles in compass, every one brandishing in each Hand a Javelin,
<PB N="11" REF="7">
some carrying three or four: thus all prepar'd, with a rally of Hounds they rouse the Prey, then contracting their wide Circumference by degrees into a narrower&punc; Circuit, closing up at last Man to Man, Shoulder to Shoulder; this done, if any one of their thrown Spears hit and fasten into the Body of the Game, they never lose him, for their Launces being short, not above six Foot long, and Pointed with Iron, having three retorted Hooks, stick so fast, that though flying to shelter amongst the Bushes and Shrubs, will not, when impe|ded by intangling Branches, drop out, and also having ty'd at the But&punc;end of the Staff a long String with a Bell, so that if by chance the Beast thus impark'd break the Pale, yet they never lose him, for they follow not only by the scent, but by the sound, both which seldom fail.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Venison how&punc;eaten.</NOTE></P>
<P>They use also Arrows, especially when they hunt wild Deer. The remain|der of the slain Venison, when they have Feasted themselves, they barter for Clothing and Raiment with the <HI>Chineses,</HI> seasoning with Salt the Humbles, to keep for their own private Store; but if by chance they kill a pregnant Doe, they unlace her, and Feasting upon the Slinck, eat up Skin and all.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Formosan</HI> Mens Ex|ercises, and their manner of Fighting.</NOTE></P>
<P>To this their Manly Divertisements, and Exercises of <HI>Saiha,</HI> pleasing Labor, as pursuing their Game, they have also rougher work, and serious engage|ments, which, when successful, brings no less delight to such a barbarous People, that is, a Civil War, ancient Feuds, or fresh Animosities, still upon new occasions fermenting, so that Town against Town, and Village against Village all the Countrey over, are in open Hostility, either publick Slaughter, or private Murder being their Sports, which thus they carry on: First one Town begins, sending the other a bold Defiance; this is follow'd by twenty or thirty in a Party, which Row in their Boats, or <HI>Champans,</HI> to their Enemies Village, near which they lie as if in Ambuscade till Night, then growing dark, they Landing, march up and down and explore the Fields, culling out private Huts, and such like Houses, where the Graver sort, the Marry'd People, as we said before, at their ease and pleasure dwell: Those that be thus supinely careless they suddenly surprise, and off goes their Heads, Hands, and Feet; some|times more cruelly they slice out their whole Bodies, each one carrying a Col|lup in triumph home, as an evidence that he had no small share in that bloody Slaughter, but, as they suppose, honorable Action: But finding no small Game, or such single Adventures, then they attempt secretly the next Village, where silently breaking into a House or two, they spare none, but salvagely kill Men, Women, and Children, carrying their Heads, Hands, and Feet home, as Trophies of their Victory: But sometimes falling short of their De|sign, are glad to escape to save themselves; and often, the whole Town so suddenly taking the alarm, they with as little mercy are all cut off: at other times in their flight so few appearing, that the Enemies in hopes of revenge, are trepann'd to their Boats, where in greater and unexpected numbers they Fight so valiantly, that they put them to the Rout; yet these though seeming Furio|so's, receiving the least Wound, basely Retreat and quit the Battel.</P>
<P>Their Defensive Arms are Shields, so large, that they cover their whole Bo|dies;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Arms.</NOTE> their Offensive, Darts and Faulchions.</P>
<P>It often happens, that two or three Villages joyn against one or more asso|ciated Towns: these have no Commission-Officer, or Commander, but who|soever shews most Men, they make their General, and hath the prime Autho|rity to rule over the others according to their numbers. Neither are their Warlike Stratagems common, for when they intend to Attaque some Village
<PB N="12" REF="8">
by a sudden surprisal, for they have no Works to storm, opposite to the way that they appear upon, and ready to enter the Village; on the contrary side they lie in Ambush, which when they Charge in, giving a smart alarm, the&punc; People struck with a sudden fear, in a confus'd manner, betake themselves to their Heels, and flying from, fall just into the Mouth of the same Enemy, who suddenly starting up, are not sparing, but oftentimes make a general slaughter, whilst the others ransack and pillage the Houses. Sometimes in the Night they break into a House or two, which leaving, their business being done, two of the Par|ties stick fast in their likeliest way to return, so to stop the Pursuer, sharp-poin|ted Reeds, about half a Yard long, they making their Retreat by another im|probable way. Each Conqueror that shares for his own part a Head, carries it through his Village upon a Spear, insulting and singing in praise and glory of his God, to whom he solely ascribes his Victory; thus proudly vaporing, they are joyfully receiv'd every where, and entertain'd with the best Liquor the Town affords.</P>
<P>Every sixteen Houses have their own Chappel, to which they carry this<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Formosans</HI> have great Churches.</NOTE> their bloody Spoil, which afterwards he boyls till the Flesh comes from the Bone, then drying it in the Sun, they pour strong Liquor (a Custom which they never omit) upon the bare Scalp: fourteen days they keep Holy, Feast|ing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Keep great Feasts when they are Conquerors.</NOTE> and Sacrificing to their gods, who gave them so great and glorious a Victory.</P>
<P>Of these Heads, who e're enjoys one, looks upon it as his greatest Treasure, prizing them beyond Gold or Silver, or the most precious Jewel, and when any sudden accident of Fire, or the like happen, this they take most care of, how to carry it with them, or leave in safety.</P>
<P>This Isle, as we said before, hath no King, nor Supreme Governor, but eve|ry<NOTE PLACE="marg">Have no supreme Go|vernor.</NOTE> petty Village is a small Republick, Ruling it self under twelve Magistrates, chosen every second year; whose chief Qualification is to be fifty years old:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Councellors.</NOTE> these when going out, in Honor and Commemoration that they were once prime Rulers, have all their Hair pick'd off from their Temples, and each side of their Heads with Tweasers; which baldness is the well-known Badge of their former Authority. But these Governors Power hath but small Limits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Authority.</NOTE> for in every Exigence all the Villages meet in the Temple there, having no Representatives, every Man speaks to the purpose according to his abilities, or as he is biass'd; which done, the Twelve take into their consideration, and from the general result of their various opinions, give their special Verdicts, which the People as they like or dislike, ratifie or refuse. But they have abso|lute Power to seize the Clothes of whomsoever wears Apparel in that three Moneths, when by their Laws they are commanded to go naked, and Pray to their Idols for Rain, being about that time always a dry Season. This also in part they inflict upon the Women that go too gorgeously in that Quarter. This their Court of twelve Aldermen suffer great hardship or Penance, not be|ing allow'd by their Laws to taste any strong Drink, as <HI>Pietang,</HI> use Sugar, or eat any Fat of their Meat, till such time as their Rice is half ripe, believing that onely preserves the sprouting Blade from the harrase of wild Beasts, as Deer, Swine, and such like.</P>
<P>Their chief Practise, and special Vertues, are Theft, Murder, and Adultery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The punishment of Cri|minals.</NOTE> at which they are very dextreous, either by Stratagems, or down-right vio|lence, and he that reckons up the most of such dire Actions, appears amongst them the bravest Fellow.</P>

<P>The Males must not Marry before their one and twentieth Year, nor wear<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Marriage.</NOTE> long Hair till the seventeenth. Their ceremonious Rites of Matrimony are on|ly consummated thus: The Suiter, who by the advice of his Parents or his own Affection, hath cast his Eye upon a Mistress, begins his Courtship or Gal|lanting with a Present, which his Mother, or a near Relation, carries to her House, there presenting in her Servants Name, with all Complements, and Manifestations of his Affection. These Gifts are commonly eight Skirts or Pet|ticoats, as many Wastcoats, or Upper-Bodice, four hundred Armlets of pleited Rush, a dozen Rings for their Fingers, either Copper, or white polish'd Harts|horn, and so many Laces of red Dogs Hair, five Linnen Girdles, twelve Dogs Hair Coverlets, thirty <HI>Chinesie</HI> Pieces of Cloth, a great Box full of Dogs Hair, with which they make a Border, or Love-shade, to beautifie their Forehead and Temples, which they call <HI>Ayam Maniang,</HI> and five pair of Hart-skin Stock|ings. These Presents are sent onely by the Wealthiest; and those that are less able according to their abilities. If what they thus present is receiv'd, the busi|ness is concluded, and Marriage presently confirm'd by the Nuptial Bed.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the concluding Ceremony, the Husband and Wife dwell<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Formosan</HI> Men live not with the Women&punc;</NOTE> not together, but live apart by themselves; but in the Night he is allow'd in a clandestine way to steal to his Enjoyments; whither making his approaches, he is neither allow'd Fire nor Candle, but with all silence and secrecy steals in|to the Bed; neither there must he speak to his Bride, but if he want any thing, that he signifies by Coughing; upon which, guessing what it may be, his Wife administers, and her Houshold-business being done, she comes to Bed; a hard Lodging, where indeed they have no Bed, neither Pillow nor Bolster, but a Buck-skin spread upon the Floor; yet others have a Bedstead spread with Rushes. These hardships, as they suppose, makes them fitter for the encoun|ters of <HI>Venus,</HI> and more stirs up Loves fervor than warm dalliance in softer ac|commodations: Neither may he linger there, but e're the Dawn visibly ap|pear, thence he must, that so his departing with an appetite, he may be the more earnest for a second fruition: But all this while neither of them are a burthen to one another, but each provide for themselves, and follow their own affairs; and if they meet by chance in the Day, they pass by like Strangers, the Husband<NOTE PLACE="marg">May not speak to them in the day-time.</NOTE> not daring to speak to his Wife without her License. The Charge of bring|ing up of the Children is left to her Care, till they are above one and twenty years of age, then their Father receives and keeps, or disposes of them as he thinks fitting.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Formosan</HI> Women have a barbarous Custom (void of all Motherly af|fection, and humane reason,) for whoever proves with Child before thirty

seven years of age, when the Fruit of her Womb waxeth ripe and fit for Delive|ry, they cruelly and in unspeakable manner destroy: for in stead of a Midwise that should assist them in their Labor, or Childbed-throws, they employ a cruel Dame, who laying them in a fit posture on their best and softest Bed, crushes<NOTE PLACE="marg">Horrible Murder of their Infants.</NOTE> and kneads the tender Infant in the Womb, till it become like a lump of Dough, which departs from them with more extreme torture, than if they were natu|rally deliver'd.</P>
<P><HI>Georgius Canidius,</HI> a Minister of the Gospel, residing in <HI>Formosa Anno</HI> 1628 re|lates, that he knew a <HI>Formosan</HI> Woman, who was deliver'd of sixteen Children in that horrible manner, her first Abortion being in her seventeenth Year; and he being inquisitive to know why she thus made away what would have been her own dear Issue, and to be esteem'd most of all worldly joys by her, receiv'd this answer from her, That her shamefac'dness and modesty forbad her to be a Mother before she was of age of discretion, being accounted amongst them thir|ty seven Years.</P>

If he can clearly convict her, shewing just reason for his separation, he recovers her Dowry, seizing those Gifts which he presented before Marri|age; but failing either in his Arguments or Proofs, the Divorc'd Wife preserves her own Estate. Some Marry two Wives, but they are look'd upon as commit|ting Fornication or Adultery; but of late, Custom, and the common practice, makes the offence not altogether so hainous.</P>
<P>Their Youth and Batchellors have their peculiar Residence; for in every Vil|lage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Unmarry'd People have their Dwellings apart.</NOTE> as we said before, sixteen Houses have their Chappel, in which they have distinct Lodgings, as in a Colledge, where they keep their Batchellors Place, though Marry'd, till such time as they go to live with their Wives.</P>

They Dance all Night before the Door after this manner: They take a Trough like a Chest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Dancings</NOTE> but longer and broader, and turning the bottom upwards, the Women get up, and two by two, Back to Back, move their Legs and Arms in a Dancing time and measure; which pace, or taboring tread, sends a kind of a murmur|ing, or doleful Sound, from the hollow Tree; when these mounted Couples are weary, they come down, and others supply the Place: Thus the Maudlin-Drunkards dance nine Days together, whilst the Body lies parching by the Fire, sending forth a very noisom Stench; then having bath'd the Corps nine times over, they wrap it up close in a Mat, and lay it higher than before, so co|vering it with a fitted Canopy from all Light, there lying three years, till such time as nothing remains but a Skeleton, all else being consum'd to Dust; then they Interre him in his own House, with all the Ceremony of Feasts, as if lately departed.</P>
<P>The ordering of their Sick is no less unnatural and preposterous; for they<NOTE PLACE="marg">How strangely they or|der their Sick.</NOTE> use them worse than if the Devil were their Doctor; for in stead of Potion or Pill, and the like, they have but one Medicine for all Diseases, and that's a dry Halter, especially in the Village <HI>Teopan;</HI> for as soon as any Person falls sick, and begins to complain, lying down, and not able to walk about, and follow his Business, they presently prepare a tough Cord, in stead of Cordial; so putting the Noose about his Neck, they hoise him up to the top of the House with a Pulley kept for that purpose, then let him suddenly fall with a Jolt, which commonly proves an immediate Cure, by killing them; yet some mend upon this choking Medicine, either by the strength of Nature, or their Spi|rits irritated by the fright.</P>
<P>The <HI>Formosans</HI> neither Write nor Read, using no Books, Letters, nor Cha|racters:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Religion of the <HI>For|mosans.</HI></NOTE> but yet that Law and Religion which they have amongst them, they observe without alteration, deliver'd by Tradition from Generation to Generation: For certain young Men are appointed to be instructed from the elder; and faithful Memories are their onely Registers and Records.</P>
<P>First, They believe the Universe, Heaven and Earth, to have been without beginning, and shall be without end.</P>
<P>Secondly, they acknowledge the Immortality of the Soul; for which rea|son, they build a little Place, in which they put a Tub of Water with a Dish in it, before the Door of the Deceased, supposing the Spirit thereof comes dai|ly thither to bathe or cleanse.</P>
<P>The next Article of their Faith is, That there are several Punishments af|ter this Life, according to the equality of their Crimes, and Rewards of Eter|nal Happiness for those that have, when living, merited by doing well: there|fore they dig broad and deep Trenches, filling them with Mud and Slime; over which they make a floating Bridge of bundled-up Rushes, which leads to the most delightful and luxurious Vales in the Countrey: Over these, as they affirm, the Souls of the Deceased must pass, which the Wicked endeavoring to cross, the unstable Truss, or rowling Bridge, tumbles them over into their Sty|gian Lake; but the Just and Godly walking in safety over, enjoy there all Pleasure in an everlasting <HI>Elysium.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="10">Those Sins which they account most hainous, are but frivolous Toys, built<NOTE PLACE="marg">What they account Sin.</NOTE> upon Superstition and sleight Observation, as not to go naked (as we said be|fore) at their set and appointed times; to wear Clothes or any thing of Silk&punc; Women to bear Children before their seven and thirtieth year; to fetch and eat Oysters not in due season; and to venture to undertake any Business; though of little or no consequence, before they have observ'd good Auguries from the Notes or Language of the Birds: All these are Capital, and, as they hold sorth, unpardonable Offences; but Murder, Theft, Lying, and Forswear|ing, these have their Qualifications; for some may commit them, and some may not, without any scruple; but in general they are look'd upon no more than Peccadillo's, and venial Offences.</P>
<P>When they take an Oath, they ratifie it by breaking a Straw. To be a pub|like and common Drunkard, and to be an Adulterer, and Debaucher of young Women, if carried privately, is no harm.</P>
<P>Though they believe the Immortality of the Soul, yet they utterly deny the Resurrection of the Body.</P>
<P>Amongst their several gods which they worship, the chiefest are <HI>Tamagisan|hach,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their chiefest Idols.</NOTE> who Governs and Inhabits the South; his Celestial Spouse, <HI>Taxankpada Agodales,</HI> commands the East, where when it happens to Thunder, they be|lieve that she exercises her Tongue, the Females best Arms, scolding so loud at her Husband in the South, because he neglects his Office, not sending Rain when the Earth needs; who being nettled with his Wives bitter and sharp ex|pression, not enduring to hear her any longer, opens his Mouth, sending, and dispersing with his Breath abundance of Water.</P>
<P>Another Deity which they worship out of fear, because <HI>Tamagisanhach,</HI> as they say, creates Men with comely Visages, and well-proportion'd Bodies; this being an angry and ill natur'd Power, delighting in mischief, makes it his whole Business to spoil and mis-shape what <HI>Tamagisanhach</HI> hath made fair and handsom, disfiguring their Faces with Pox and Blasting, bunch|ing their Backs, withering and crooking their Limbs, and the like, then deriding at their Lameness and Deformity: so this <HI>Sariafing</HI> they hold in great Veneration, that he would be pleas'd to spare them, and do them no harm.</P>
<P>When they take up Arms, and proclaim Hostility, they offer Sacrifices to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their gods of War.</NOTE> <HI>Talafula</HI> and <HI>Tapaliape,</HI> their two gods of War.</P>
<P>Their Priests, or rather Priestesses, which they call <HI>Inibs,</HI> are Women, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Women perform Divine Services.</NOTE> whole Function in Divine Service, or Worship, belonging to them; for they not only Pray to their gods, and Preach, but also Sacrifice: Their chiefest Offerings are Stags and Boars Heads, presented in a Charger, upon boyl'd Rice, <HI>Pynang,</HI> and other strong Drinks, as a Condiment: This perform'd, two of the Female Order stand up before the Congregation, and make a Sermon, in which they set forth the Praise and Honor of their gods, going on with that vehemency of expressions and loud declamations, that at last their Hair stands upright, and their Eyes rowling, seem ready to start out of their Heads; then<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange actions.</NOTE> near the Conclusion of these their dire Exhortations, they fall down in a Trance, and oftentimes lie so for a whole Hour, whilst the People gathering near them, tear their Throats, and cleave the Air with hideous shrieks and cries; when coming to themselves, in a cold and faint Sweat, their Limbs trembling, their Teeth chattering, strangely discompos'd, they tell the Peo|ple, That in their Trance the gods appear'd to them, unfolding mysterious

things for their good, not yet to be express'd; besides, two others of these Women mount the Battlements of the Temple, and standing at the gable ends, they make afresh loud, and long Supplications to their gods: At last they strip themselves, and thus denuded, crying more earnestly to their gods, and first shaking, then taboring, or clapping with their Hands, raging as in a phanatick distraction. All the Women, following their impudent example, throw off with their Weeds all Shame at once, and so Tope and Deboush, till<NOTE PLACE="marg">Drunkenness a Vertue.</NOTE> they disgorge their too plentiful excess.</P>
<P>Besides this their publick Worship in the Temple, they Offer in the open Streets, and exercise private and domestick Devotions, performing Family|duties daily in their own Houses, to which those that please may repair, and joyn with them in this their Idol-Service.</P>
<P>With these <HI>Inibs</HI> also they consult concerning fair or foul Weather, when<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Office of the <HI>Inibs.</HI></NOTE> they have any Business abroad; also of future Events, which they seem to foretell, and if bad, advise how to prevent, or at least to mitigate: They also profess Exorcism, to drive away Evil Spirits, and to charm and confine the Devil, and all such deceitful Tempters; which they perform in a Rant, with loud Hectoring Acclamations, drawing a <HI>Iapan</HI> Faulchion, with which they Fence, Strike, and Thrust, flourishing it in the Air, making them believe, that thus they Fight the Fiend, and slice Satan out in Sippets, forcing him, thus being mangled, and cut almost into Attoms, to dive for his better safety into the Sea.</P>
<P>Yet these so salvage People, and blind with an over-grown ignorance, have<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Formosans</HI> become <HI>Chri|stians.</HI></NOTE> lately (since the <HI>Hollanders East-India</HI> Company setled here, and built a Fort for their Defence, and conveniency of Trade) without any great difficulty embrac'd the Doctrine of the <HI>Christian</HI> Faith; which was the easier introduc'd, the Inhabitants being their own Governors, and under no Supream Authority,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why they are easier converted than other <HI>Indi|dians.</HI></NOTE> who exercising a Tyrannical Power, would, as other Persecutors, force them back from Gods true, to their false Idol-Worship, as at that time most part of <HI>India</HI> was, being either under <HI>Heathen</HI> or <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Governors, who with great fury obstructed the Gospel, which else might have flourish'd through the Oriental World: Besides, the <HI>Formosans</HI> kept no Books, wherein the Bounds of Religion were fix'd, and a setled maintain'd Doctrine, which still caus'd great variance, and hot Disputes amongst themselves, the whole Conduct of their Divine Laws being left to a few frantick and ignorant Women, who know nothing but by Tradition. This made it the more easie to reduce them from their <HI>Paganism</HI> and <HI>Idolatry;</HI> and finding little in their frenzied <HI>Inibs,</HI> that might perswade them to persist in their former Superstitions, many of them, with small difficulty, became good <HI>Christians.</HI> Thus far <HI>Candidius,</HI> which we have acquainted you with in our <HI>Iapan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>David Wright</HI> a <HI>Scots-man,</HI> and later than <HI>Candidius,</HI> who dwelt in the Isle seve|ral years, hath thus enlarg'd more particularly in every part.</P>
<P>This Island is not under the Jurisdiction of one peculiar Governor, but<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Island <HI>Formosa</HI> is divided into eight Domi|nions.</NOTE> stands divided into eleven Shires or Provinces, all lying to the In-land, of which every one hath several Towns and Villages belonging to them, be|sides divers Lordships on the Mountains.</P>
<P>Under the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Command, (with which we will begin first) were for|merly in the Northern Confines <HI>Sinkkan, Tavakan, Baklawan, Soelang, Mattou, Ti|verang, Faberlang, Takhais, Tornap, Terenip,</HI> and <HI>Assoek.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="11">The second Province is <HI>Kabelang,</HI> a Territory by the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> call'd <HI>The Bay of Kabelang,</HI> and contains seventy two Towns and Villages, every one govern'd by their own peculiar Laws, and in amity with each other. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> never being able to subdue the Inhabitants thereof, were forc'd to make Peace with them; after which they not onely Traded with several sorts of Merchandise, but also sold their Sons and Daughters to them for Slaves, taking commonly for a Youth of thirteen years old, ten Rix-Dollars.</P>
<P>The third Dominion belongs to the King of <HI>Middag,</HI> lying against the North-East of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> Southward of the River <HI>Patientia.</HI></P>
<P>This Prince hath seventeen Towns that obey him, the biggest whereof, call'd <HI>Middag,</HI> is his chief Seat, and Place of Residence: <HI>Sada, Boedor, Dere|donesel,</HI> and <HI>Goema,</HI> are four other of his eminent Towns, which last is a hand|som place, lying five Miles from <HI>Patientia,</HI> in a Plain, whereas all the other are built on Hills. He had formerly twenty seven Towns under his Jurisdiction; but ten of them threw off the Yoke. He keeps no great State, being at his going abroad accompanied onely with one or two Attendants. He would never suffer any <HI>Christians</HI> to dwell in his Dominions, but onely allows them to Travel through his Countrey.</P>
<P>About seven Leagues to the Northward of <HI>Middag,</HI> and four Leagues from the Sea, lies Mount <HI>Gedult,</HI> so call'd from its difficult and hard Ascents: It ap|pears square like a Table, so even and smooth, as if it were the Work of Art, not of Nature, having the advantage of adjacent Plains round about, and is over-grown with Brambles. On the South-side, at the Foot of this Hill, glides a River with so strong a Current, that the stoutest of the Natives, which are Men of able Bodies, dares not adventure to wade through it in any place; so that to make it fordable, they never attempt with less than twenty or thirty together, holding fast one by another; wherefore the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have by an <HI>Irony</HI> call'd it <HI>Rio Patientia, The Patient River;</HI> because to pass that rapid Stream, asks not only a great deal of Labor, but also some Patience.</P>
<P>The fourth Jurisdiction is that of <HI>Pimaba,</HI> comprehending eight Towns, and several Villages, the chiefest whereof is <HI>Pimaba,</HI> the Residence for the Go|vernor. The Inhabitants thereof are a stout and warlike People, and most ex|pert in their manner of Arms, of all the <HI>Formosans.</HI> This King, look'd upon as a brave Person, keeps a constant Guard, and is always quarrelling, and making War with his Neighbors. He was formerly in Friendship with the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and proud to serve under them as Serjeant of a Company.</P>
<P>The fifth is <HI>Sapat,</HI> lying quite on the other side of <HI>Formosa,</HI> and commands over ten Towns; the Governor whereof is in League with <HI>Pimaba.</HI></P>
<P>The sixth Dominion is call'd <HI>Takabolder,</HI> and hath eight Towns, besides se|veral Villages under its Jurisdiction.</P>
<P>In <HI>Takabolder</HI> appears an exceeding high Mountain, which may be seen from <HI>Tayowan.</HI></P>
<P>The seventh Lordship is that of <HI>Cardeman,</HI> govern'd by a Woman, who for her kind reception of the <HI>Christians,</HI> was by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> call'd <HI>The Good Woman:</HI> She commands over five Villages. When the <HI>Hollanders</HI> march'd into the Field, she sent them Provisions, had a great Authority over her Subjects, and being a Widow, married to one of the Princes of the Countrey.</P>
<P>The eighth Territory hath twelve Villages, of which the chiefest are <HI>Dere|dou, Orrazo, Porraven, Barraba, Warrawarra, Tannatanna,</HI> and <HI>Cubeca.</HI></P>
<P>The ninth is call'd <HI>Tokodekal,</HI> and hath seven Towns, and seven Villages;
<PB N="19" REF="11">
the chief whereof is <HI>Tokodekal,</HI> where the Governor hath his Residence.</P>
<P>The tenth, nam'd <HI>Pukkal,</HI> consists onely of one handsom City, and main|tains a continual War against the seven Villages of <HI>Tokodekal,</HI> and likewise against <HI>Percuzi</HI> and <HI>Pergunu,</HI> two Towns, which make the eleventh Dominion.</P>
<P>Besides all these foremention'd Places, there are abundance of Lordships in the Mountains; but we will not trouble the Reader with naming them, because they are so numerous, and for that every one is for it self, and conti|nually make War one against another: But those Places which formerly the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had reduc'd, they kept in good order and quiet.</P>
<P>These Islands of <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Tayowan,</HI> especially the Coasts, suffer much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Storms and Tempests; for oftentimes the Wind blows down whole Trees and Houses, rending both Walls and Roofs from top to bottom: Besides by these Huricanes yearly many Ships are lost that approach near the Coasts.</P>
<P>Both these Isles also endure terrible Earthquakes. <HI>Anno</HI> 1654. hapned a mighty Earthquake, on the fourteenth of <HI>December,</HI> which continu'd, with short intermissions, almost seven Weeks together. It also rains here very much; wherefore none can travel above two Months, being <HI>December</HI> and <HI>Ianuary,</HI> for then is generally the fairest Weather; but their greatest and per|petual Rains happen onely in <HI>Iuly</HI> and <HI>August.</HI> There are two <HI>Mousons,</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Stormy Seasons; the one the Northern, and the other the Southern <HI>Mouson:</HI> The first begins in <HI>October,</HI> and continues till <HI>March;</HI> the second begins in <HI>May,</HI> and holds till <HI>September,</HI> which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> call'd <HI>The unconstant Month,</HI> because of its often change of Weather.</P>
<P>The circumjacent Sea, that washes the Skirts of these Isles, abounds with Fish, especially the <HI>Harder,</HI> or <HI>Shepherd-Fish,</HI> and another call'd the <HI>Kings-Fish.</HI> The <HI>Chineses</HI> come yearly towards <HI>February,</HI> from the Main-Land, with thousands of Jonks, to take these <HI>Shepherds,</HI> some of the Jonks being able to carry five or six hundred Tun. There sail also another sort of Vessels amongst these Jonks, which they call <HI>Koiaes,</HI> or <HI>Wankans,</HI> somewhat smaller than our Cock-boats.</P>
<P>This <HI>Harder,</HI> or <HI>Shepherd,</HI> is a Fish about the bigness of a <HI>Whiting,</HI> which when taken, is slit to the Back like <HI>Habberdine,</HI> then salted, and pack'd up in Barrels, is sent in Pickle all over <HI>China,</HI> as we and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> send our Her|rings through <HI>Europe.</HI> The Rows of these Fishes are also salted, and put into Pots, which remaining very red, are accounted for a great Dainty amongst the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P>For the Priviledge of Fishing under this Island, the <HI>Chineses</HI> us'd to pay the Tithes of all Fish for Custom, to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> there resident.</P>
<P>The Soil hath in it a natural Fertility, yet lies most part waste, through the ignorance and sloth of the Inhabitants: The fruitfullest Tract the King of <HI>Middag</HI> possesses, which produces abundance of Rice, Wheat, Barley, Rye, <HI>Kayjang,</HI> Ginger, Sugar, several sorts of Trees, and great variety of Fruits, as Lemmons, Oranges, Citrons, Pumpeons, Water-Melons, Cucumers, <HI>Ananasses, China</HI>-Roots, <HI>Kadjang, Fokkafoka,</HI> Potatoes, <HI>Ubes,</HI> Sweet-Herbs, Cabbage, Car|rots, and abundance of Physical Herbs, and Cane-wood. <HI>Kadjang</HI> is a certain small Seed, green, and about the bigness of Coriander, which boyl'd with salt and fresh Fish, gives a more pleasant taste. <HI>Fokkafokas</HI> is a Fruit like a Pear, but thrice as big as one of our greatest; white on the shady side, and on the other, in stead of Red, of a Purple Colour, and shines on the top like Glass. It is first cut into four Quarters, then boyld with Flesh or Bacon, like Turneps,
<PB N="20" REF="12">
Carrots, or Coleworts: Of the Broth, sweetned with Sugar they make good Drink.</P>
<P>They also have some few Sheep, and store of Harts, Goats, stags, Conies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Beasts.</NOTE> Hares, tame and wild Swine, Tygers, Bears, Apes, and the like : But they have there also another kind of Creature, by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> call'd <HI>Tayowans Devil,</HI> about an Ell long, and five Inches broad&punc; it is full of Scales, both un|der his Belly, and on his Back; hath four Feet, a long sharp Head, very sharp Claws, and a Tail thin at the end; his Food nothing but Pismires; for be|ing hungry, they put forth their Tongues, which when they perceive creep upon it, they draw in again, and so swallow their Prey: It is an Enemy on|ly to the Ants, and is very fearful of Men, from whom it flies upon the first sight, into any hole, or else winds it self together; but if taken by the Tail, and shaken, opens again; so that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have by an <HI>Irony</HI> nam'd it the <HI>Tayowans Devil,</HI> being so harmless, that it will neither offend another, nor defend it self. None of these are found in all <HI>Asia,</HI> but on this Isle, where they have all manner of Fowl else, except Parrots. There are also Serpents, <HI>Millepedes,</HI> Scorpions&punc; Hedgehogs, and many other monstrous Creatures. They likewise oftentimes see great Swarms of Locusts.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1655. abundance of Locusts spread themselves over these Islands of <HI>For|mosa</HI> and <HI>Tayowan:</HI> At their first appearance in <HI>Tayowan,</HI> they fell down from the Sky, like a great Snow here with us, and cover'd the whole Ground: Af|ter two days they directed their way to <HI>Sakkam,</HI> multiplying in such manner, that no place was free of them. The People endeavoring to destroy the young Locusts in <HI>Sakkam,</HI> in four or five days got thirty thousand <HI>Picol</HI> weight: But<NOTE PLACE="marg">Every <HI>Picol</HI> is 125 pound weight.</NOTE> all prov'd in vain, and they were forc'd to give over, when they saw their prodigious increase, utterly destroying their Sugar and Rice Fields every where.</P>
<P>Against the North-East part of <HI>Formosa</HI> lies a great and rich Golden Mine, surrounded by many other Marble Quarries: At the Foot thereof runs a Ri|ver, with many winding Reaches; so that any one which intends to go in quest of the Gold, must cross this Stream above twenty times, and not with|out great danger, because of the Stones, which frequently tumble from the Rocks. In <HI>August</HI> the great Rains sweep down an incredible Store of this rich Metal, which falls into Pits made on purpose at the Foot of the Hill, which the Inhabitants draining, gather the pure Oar from the bottom.</P>
<P>These Mountains are inhabited by a People which know no Prince, nor hitherto have been conquer'd by any. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> have often endeavour'd to gain some Ground in these High-lands; but were always repuls'd.</P>
<P>The Men of <HI>Formosa</HI> are very large and strong Limb'd, especially those in the Plain Countrey; for those of the Mountains are generally of lesser Stature, and the Women yet smaller than either. They are full-fac'd, and without Beards, not naturally, but by continual plucking out of the Hair so soon as it buds: They have great Eyes, flat Noses, large Breasts, and very long Ears, which they count a great Ornament, and are bored through, and tenter'd out broad with a Horn; some hang a round Tablet in the Hole, painted and carv'd after their manner; others, colour'd Shells; but chiefly on Festival days, and when they are to appear before their Idols; for on other days they leave their long extended Lugs, which cover their Collar-bone, naked and without Ornament, then no beautifying Addition to take Strangers, hanging almost half way down to their naked Breasts: Their Hair as black as Jeat,

is also very long, and by most worn as they do in <HI>Europe;</HI> but some, after the ancient <HI>Chinese</HI> manner, tye it on the top of their Heads, or braid it into one Lock. They are of a Tawny or Olivaster Complexion, not much fairer than the <HI>Mulatto.</HI> The Women of <HI>Midag</HI> are bright, like the golden Yellow, as likewise like those of <HI>Soetan Nouwe,</HI> and the Island <HI>Lamey.</HI></P>
<P>They are ingenious, of subtile Wit, and great Memories, and none of the <HI>Indians</HI> are fitter to understand the Mysteries of, and readier to embrace the <HI>Christian Faith.</HI></P>
<P>Their Habit or Summer-Garment, is only a thin Cotton Coat, made wide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Apparel.</NOTE> tied fast on the Breast by two Corners, and then put under one of their Arms; so that generally one side of their Bodies is cover'd, and the other bare; about the middle close girt, and hanging down below their Knees. They neither wear Shoes nor Stockins; but sometimes a kind of Pumps or Sandals, made of Goat-skins, which they fasten on the top of their Feet.</P>
<P>In the Winter time they wear Tygers, Leopards, Bears, and other Wild|beasts Skins. The People of <HI>Soulang</HI> went habited like the <HI>Dutch,</HI> being still conversant among them; but all the rest, like the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P>Before the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> coming thither, the Inhabitants went na|ked; which Salvage Custom those that live in the Mountains still continue, wearing onely a small Cloth before.</P>
<P>The Womens Habit agrees almost with the Mens, onely with this diffe|rence, that they tie Clouts about their Legs, like Spatterdashes, and have short Coats, like a Half-shirt without Sleeves, which reach down to their Middle, and under that a Cotton Cloth, falling down to their Knees. Their Heads are filleted with a piece of Silk, about a Yard and half long, whose two ends stick out like Horns, on their Foreheads; and none of them ever wear Shoes: But every Woman hath commonly a great Pig running after her, as we use to have a Dog.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="13">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The Men paint the Skin of their Breasts, Backs, and Arms, with a Colour which remains in the Flesh, and will never be got out, and by them account|ed a great Bravery: about their Necks and Arms they hang Glass Beads strung, and Iron Armlets, which sit very straight, like an Elbow-Gauntlet, so narrow in the Wrist, that it seems impossible almost how they could be put over the Hand; and on their Legs they have Anclets of white Shells, joyn'd together like a Scallop Lace.</P>
<P>The Men of <HI>Tokdadekol</HI> wear as an Ornament a long Cane, which they stick behind their Backs at a Girdle, the other end bowing over their Heads, having a white or red Flag about two Handfuls broad.</P>
<P>Their Heads on Holydays are gay with Cocks Feathers, and their Arms and Legs with Bears Tails: The Women also use Glass, and Stones, and sometimes also Rix-Dollars. The Skins of Deer, spread on the Ground, serve them for Beds and Blankets. They have no Societies of Artificers, or Ma|nufactory; but every one is his own Work-man, and Seamster, making what is necessary or useful for themselves to wear: They are very dexterous and rea|dy in handling their Bowes and Arrows; and such excellent Swimmers, that they will bear on their Backs another Person through the swiftest Current.</P>
<P>They exercise themselves much in Running, and are very swift of Foot; so that some of them are able to beat a Horse at full speed: When they run, they hold a kind of a Bell about six Inches long in their Hand, which tinkles slower or faster according to their motion.</P>
<P>They never venture out to Sea, but Fish in Rivers with small <HI>Canoos.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants neither understand to brew Beer, as in <HI>Europe;</HI> nor press Wine, having no Grapes: But they use a certain Liquor call'd <HI>Musakkauw,</HI> or <HI>Machiko,</HI> made of Rice and Water, after this manner. A Vessel about the bigness of a Hogshead, or a Barrel, they fill two third parts with chaw'd and boyl'd Rice, and then fill'd up with Water to the top: This being a Brimmer, luted up, is put seven Foot deep under Ground, where it stands a whole Year; then
<PB N="23" REF="13">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
'tis again taken up, and the Moisture press'd out of the Rice (for most of the Water is soak'd into the Rice) with their Hands: After eight days the Juyce works it self into a very wholesom Liquor, which may compare with the strongest Wine, and will remain good twenty or thirty Years; for the older it grows, the stronger and pleasanter it tastes, being preserv'd in the same Pots it was made in, and cover'd over with Earth. There are some Houses which have stow'd in their Butteries two or three hundred of these Vessels. At the Birth of a Child, the Father prepares two or three Pots of this Drink, and preserves it till the Childs Marriage. All the Wild People, both Men and Women, are great Lovers of this Liquor, and account it the chiefest <HI>Regalia,</HI> when they are caress'd with this Cordial.</P>
<P>They have yet another sort of Drink, by them call'd <HI>Cuthay,</HI> made of the same press'd Rice (which they preserve, and through not away) in this man|ner: They take a Handful of this Rice, and put it into a <HI>Callabash,</HI> which con|tains about two Gallons, which they fill up with Water: This is a cool Drink, not strong, and hath onely a smatch of the <HI>Masakauw.</HI></P>
<P>In the Northern Part of <HI>Formosa,</HI> between <HI>Kelang</HI> and <HI>Tamsay,</HI> and between <HI>Tamsay</HI> and <HI>Mount Gedult,</HI> they make another Drink of Wood-ashes, which is also very strong, but unwholesom for the <HI>Europeans,</HI> because 'tis apt to excori|ate, breeding the Bloody-Flux: But the Natives, though so well stor'd with these several Liquors, yet for the most part satisfie themselves with Water.</P>
<P>Their usual Diet is dry'd Venison, Flesh of Wild Swine, and Fish; all which they eat raw, without Seething or Rosting: Boyl'd Rice serves them for Bread, which they take with their four fingers, and toss into their Mouthes. They seeth not their Rice in Water; but putting it into a Cullender, hang it over a Pot fill'd with boyling Water, from whose ascending Steam and Heat, the Rice grows moist and warm.</P>
<P>In the Southern Parts of <HI>Akkou</HI> and <HI>Zoetanau,</HI> they make Cakes of Rice, and prepare their Venison after a strange manner; <HI>viz.</HI> The Flesh cut from the

Bones in Slices of two Inches thick, is salted in a Trough, and pack'd very close; and after lying thus one Night, they set it on the Roof of their Hou|ses to dry in the Air, where it becomes so hard as Stock-fish, yet tastes better than Mutton, and is generally sold for about a Shilling a <HI>Cattay,</HI> that is, a Pound.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants also take Tobacco&punc; although it grows not there, but is brought to them from <HI>China:</HI> Their Pipes are thin Reeds or Canes, with Stone Heads: That which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> often smok'd there, was brought from <HI>Iapan;</HI> which though strong, is but like the Refuse of other Tobacco.</P>
<P>Their Houses are all built of Wood and split Canes, which because of their<NOTE PLACE="marg">Houses.</NOTE> ignorance in preparing of Lime or Stone, and the decaying of the Canes, seldom last above four or five years, at which time they pull down the old, and build new ones in the same place, though not without great charge, oc|casion'd by the unsatiable drinking of the Work-men all the time of their Building; so that an ordinary Man is scarce able to build a House. They generally stand six Foot from the Ground, on a Hill of Clay: When the Foundation is first laid, they raise several Steps from the Street to go up to it: The foremost part of the Foundation resembles a Semicircle, or Half-Moon, and likewise the Roof over the Front; the rest thatch'd with Straw, and other such like Materials, is above twenty, and sometimes above thirty Foot high, jutting four Foot over the Front, that in rainy Weather they may stand dry. Every House is almost sixty Foot broad, and two hundred Foot long, with onely one Room, and one Story. Their Penthouse, or Front-Roof, they hang full of Swines Teeth, Glasses, Shells, and such like Baubles, strung on Thred, which by the Wind being stirr'd and blown one against another, make a ging|ling noise, very pleasant. The Roof, which they finish on the Ground, is by the Builders divided into two parts, one on one side, and the other on the other laid upon the House. They begin their Buildings at a certain time of the Year, <HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>Ianuary</HI> or <HI>February,</HI> because those are dry Months; but before
<PB N="25" REF="14">
they build, they make Observations of their good Success by Dreams, which they tell to one another every Morning: If they dream of a Post, or <HI>Pisang</HI> Tree, or short Cane, they look upon it as a good signification, and begin their Building&punc; but if they Dream of a long Reed on Cane, in their Language call'd <HI>Foerik,</HI> they take it for an ill Omen, and defer the Work till they have better Visions. When they begin to build, they thus invoke one of their Idols: <HI>Oh Father, be with us; when we go to cut Canes, and we will build an Edifice for thee, and pull the old one down; which done, we will serve thee with more Zeal than ever we did before.</HI></P>
<P>Coming into the Cane Thicket, they first cut off one of the slenderest of all, speaking these words: <HI>Ipatahoang, Tuataki, Maganich, Maling;</HI> that is, <HI>To your Honor, O ye gods, we cut this Cane, because you have made good our Dreams.</HI> This Reed or Cane is not strip'd of its Leaves, because the gods may see what it was cut off for, and is Planted on the North side of their Temple; for on the South side is the Burying and Offering places for their Dead; but on the North side they offer all living things.</P>
<P>After they have cut as many Canes as they want, they pull down the old House, having before made a small Hut, just big enough to hold their Goods; before they go to work upon the main House, they offer to their gods a Box of <HI>Pinang,</HI> boyl'd Rice, and a dry'd <HI>Shepherd,</HI> or some other the like Fish, with en|treaties that they would not be angry at it; for say they, <HI>We will build you a new House, we pray you preserve us; O you that help us in all our troubles, defend us against our Enemies, and provide for us in necessity; We pray you be not offended with us; receive our Offerings, and enter with us into our new Houses.</HI> Which done, enquiry is again made amongst themselves, what appear'd to every one in their sleep the Night before, and he who is judg'd to have had the best Dream, begins the Work first, and offers strong Drink, and <HI>Pinang</HI> to the gods, praying them to grant him two quick Hands to perform his Labor. When the Walls are made, the Master of the Work first entring the House, makes an Offering to the gods be|fore all the People.</P>
<P>When they raise the Roof, three or four Women stand ready with <HI>Calliba|shes</HI> full of Water, out of which drinking, they spit some part into the Mouths of each other, which if deliver'd cleanly, and receiv'd without sprinkling, they count it a good Omen, that their Houses will prove stanch and long lasting. But the Women must be very quick in this performance, for according to their thinking, the more exquisite and nimbler they are in performance, the sooner they believe the whole work will be ended; which when effected, and the House perfectly finish'd, then they Tope at such a free and plentiful rate, that they conclude these Ceremonious Rites in the heighth of Ebrity. After this, some distance from the House, sit two or three Men, every one holding a black Pot, which they call <HI>Tatak,</HI> and Worshipping, say, <HI>Here is Liquor, come let us drink up all, neither be offended with us, O you gods, but assist us now, and always, in our Buildings.</HI> Lastly, They ask again for every ones Dream, and he that hath Dreamt best, must lay the Floor, and kindle the first Fire.</P>
<P>But concerning their Superstition in Divine Worship, they give to each Priestess a Box of <HI>Pasie,</HI> that is, a Peck of Rice in the Ear, desiring them about Noon to come to their Houses, to make an Oblation to their gods, which they perform in this manner:</P>
<P>First, A fat Porket being brought to the place, is laid with his Head to|wards the East, then the Priestess strikes him with all her strength on the back
<PB N="26" REF="15">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
with a Pestle, such as they beat Rice with, for they touch not the Head, for fear of bruising the Brains, which must remain whole, and without any confusion; if the Pestle chance to break with the blow, they take it for a certain sign, that they shall die that year. With the Hog they offer <HI>Pinang, Siri,</HI> and scalded Rice; on the Head they pour <HI>Masakhaw,</HI> and cut the Belly into handsome slices, where|of they lay one on a Chest in the House for an ornament, praying their gods to fill it with costly Goods. In like manner, they lay another piece on their Swords and Shields, and then pray to their gods to strengthen them against their Enemies; nay, they leave not a <HI>Callabash</HI> in the House without Sanctify|ing it by laying a piece of the flesh upon it; but all the Inwards are offer'd to their gods, with these words: <HI>This we give to you, our gods, to keep our Swine, and make them fat;</HI> for this trouble the Priestess, as a reward, hath ten Boxes of <HI>Pa|sie,</HI> and two yards of Painted Cloth, the right shoulder of every kill'd Pig, a piece of the Belly, a piece of the Heart, Liver, Kidney, some of the Guts, and <HI>Masakhaw;</HI> then they desire her to come every day to their Houses, there to Implore, that they may stand a long time: And such a prevailing power do the <HI>Formosans</HI> ascribe to these Sacrifices, that they believe no evil Spirit after can hurt them or theirs.</P>
<P>If any House accidentally happen to be set on fire (by which oftentimes whole Streets, nay whole Villages, by reason of the combustible Materials, are burnt to Ashes) they Apprehend, Accuse, and without Examination, as if Con|victed, punish that Man whom they first find in the Street, forcing him to make good, if able, the damage towards the Re-building, which if he refuse, his House is immediately set on fire; but if they find no body in the Street to accuse, then as if all were guilty, they lay their hands to the work, and at their own Costs and Pains finish it.</P>
<P>The chief Power and Strength of this Island consists in its People, the Coun|trey being wonderfully populous.</P>
<P>The Towns which War continually one against another, are fortifi'd with
<PB N="27" REF="15">
all manner of Inventions for strength; and in stead of Walls, surrounded with great Woods, Planted on purpose, and much stronger than any Walls, for the Trees stand exceeding close, and above three hundred Paces in breadth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The strength of the Island.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Passages in and out are onely little cross Paths, with many turnings and windings, onely wide enough for one Man to walk, so that they must fol|low each other: On both sides of the narrow Ways are some little Out-lets, in which they may lie in an Ambuscade, so that no man can pass by them, but they command him with their Bowe. In the Night they stick them full of Spikes like our <HI>Galthrops,</HI> which they make of a very hard Wood; sometimes they use Snares and Traps, which whoever comes amongst them is caught be|ing intangled; these Paths thus made, as occasion offer, they can change and desert, and make new ones when they please.</P>
<P>In <HI>Middagh</HI> and <HI>Pimeba,</HI> nay, in every Town are three or four very high Towers built of Canes, on which Men Arm'd watch with Bowes and Arrows Night and Day.</P>
<P>They continually maintain War one against another, Lord against Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manner of Fighting.</NOTE> and Village against Village: In like manner, before they March into the Fields they Superstitiously observe their Dreams which they had the Night preceding; and augury, from the singing and flying of a certain small Bird, call'd <HI>Aydak;</HI> if this Bird meets them flying with a Worm in his Bill, they take it for an in|fallible sign, that they shall conquer their Enemies; but if the Bird flies from them, or pass by them, they are so much dishearten'd with the ill Omen, that they return home, nor will Engage till they have better signs: They chuse always one most approv'd for Valor as their General, whom they stile <HI>Tama|tuwa,</HI> who never takes the Field, or Engage in Battel, before he hath by Of|ferings endeavor'd to pacifie and implore the gods for good success.</P>
<P>They shew no Mercy, nor give any Quarter, but Slaughter all, not sparing Women and Children; neither are they satisfi'd with killing them, but carry home the Heads of the Slain as Trophies of their Victory, being receiv'd at their return by their Wives and Children, with great rejoycing express'd by Singing and Dancing, and enter the Towns with the Heads of their Ene|mies erected upon long Poles, which they present to their gods seven succeed|ing Nights; after having taken off all the flesh, they hang up in their Houses the Sculls as Ornaments, as we in <HI>Europe</HI> use Paintings or Statues.</P>
<P>When they draw forth again to the like bloody Work, they take the before|mention'd Sculs with them, and stop their Mouths full of Rice: And when thus cramb'd, invoke after this manner: <HI>You Reliques, though of our Enemies, O let your Spirits departed from you, march with us into the Field, and help us to obtain the Vi|ctory; which if you please to grant, and we have the day, we promise to present you with continual Offerings, and reckon you among the number of our favoring gods:</HI> But if they be routed and some slain, whose Bodies they could not bring off, they return to their Towns with great lamentations, then feed their fancies with represen|tatives, dress'd up as Babies in Clouts, like those that were lost in the Field, whom they Interr, as if the very same Persons, and get the Priestess to make Offerings to the Deceas'd Souls, conjuring them not to go amongst, nor by in|telligence help their Adversaries: Then the Priestess goes by her self to the ap|pointed place, and offers to the Souls of the Deceas'd a Swines Liver, Heart, and one or two of the Feet, together with scalded Rice, <HI>Pinang,</HI> and <HI>Masakhaw;</HI> at her return she relates what a sad complaint the Souls departed made, and that they were almost starv'd.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="16">Their Arms are Bowes, Arrows, Shields, Swords, Faulchions, Spears, of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arms.</NOTE> Darts, about the length of a half Pike, headed with pointed Steel, and having four Rings of Barbs, close to which hangs a long Line, wherewith when they have discharg'd the Dart, and wounded any, they hale to them by the Line and Staff of the Javelin the struck Enemy, whom when within their reach, taking hold of the Hair with their left Hand, with the right they whip off their Heads, and leave the Corps neglected.</P>
<P>They fight not always, though drawn up in battel array, but when the two Armies are in view, often from each Party a bold Champion steps forth, Arm'd with a Shield, two short Swords, a Spear, and half a dozen lesser Darts; thus provided they fight valiantly till one is slain, and the Victor returning with his Head upon his Lance, about whom his Friends flock, Rejoycing, Dancing, Singing, and Drinking <HI>Masakhaw;</HI> then returning home, he fixes his bare Scull as a Register and Trophy of their Victory; and this Duel, for that time decides the Quarrel, and all march off in quiet.</P>
<P>If any of the Natives of this Isle happen to fall sick, they apply themselves on|ly<NOTE PLACE="marg">Curing of their Sick.</NOTE> to Women-Doctors, for no other officiate there; who finding out the part affected by inquiry, they rub and chafe it very strongly, and if that cure not, which seldom happens, they are at a loss, being utterly ignorant of the know|ledge of Physick, or how to make any application, either by Herbs or other Compound Medicines fitting for Distempers, or in any manner how to rectifie the Diet of the Sick. But before the <HI>Tamatatah</HI> (for so they call their Doctress) comes to the Patient, she Sacrifices to their gods; if the Distemper be small, then only with <HI>Masakhaw;</HI> but if the sickness be dangerous, with <HI>Pinang</HI> and <HI>Siry;</HI> if the Disease be stubborn, then the Priestess being sent for, makes Offering to the gods <HI>Tagitelag</HI> and <HI>Tagesikel;</HI> but if the Distemper doth not remit, then the Do|ctress and Priestess come both together, and seek by Charms and Incantations to find out whether the Person shall Live or Die, which they perform after this manner: The Priestess pretending to speak with the Sick Mans or Wo|mans Spirit, pulls them by their Fingers, which if they crack, she comforts them with hopes of recovery; but if not, they look upon it as a certain sign of Death. Secondly, they take a Leaf from a Tree, by them call'd <HI>Fangack,</HI> which putting before the Sick Persons Lips, the Priestess comes with a Mouth full of Water, and spurts on the Leaf; if the Water runs off towards her, it is a sign of Life; but if it remains with the disaffected, or fall on the other side, they expect certain death; but if at last the Sick recovers, he is not permitted to come into their Congregation during their <HI>Karichang,</HI> for that is a testimony of his Thankfulness for the preservation of Life; and then he brings to the Prie|stess a Pot full of <HI>Masakhaw,</HI> an Offering to the gods <HI>Takafocloe, Telumalum,</HI> and <HI>Tapali Appe,</HI> saying, <HI>Accept this as a token of Thanksgiving from my Hands; you have well done to give me Life.</HI> While they are going to the Priestess about this affair, they must take heed that they meet with no Blind or Decrepit Person, for if they should, they must return, lest they be punish'd with another Sickness. They also account it a strange Omen, to hear any one Sneese in their going: But if the Distemper increase daily to a greater height, either by Convulsions or other acute Pains, they lay the whole blame upon the Devil himself, as being the Author, whom they call <HI>Schytinglitto;</HI> whom to expel, they send for the Priestess, who conjures him in this manner: First, after some Oblations, she prays to the gods to strengthen her against the Devil, and banish all man|ner of fears from her; then calling for a Sword, and a Pot of <HI>Masakhaw,</HI> at|tended
<PB N="29" REF="16">
with some of the stoutest Youth, which are so valiant as to venture with her, hunts through all the corners of the House after the Devil; whom when she hath found, as she crys out, she drives away, assisted by the young Men, making a most terrible noise. Having thus driven him a considerable way to the Bank of a River, or some running Water, or to the Woods if there be no Water near, then she takes the Pot with <HI>Masakhaw,</HI> and first drinking a good Soope out of it, throwing the remainder Pot and all after the Devil, and says these words, <HI>Take that, and return not to the Patient from whom I expell'd you.</HI> This done, she plants a Cane in the Ground, of which (as they report) the Devil stands in great fear.</P>
<P>When the Fiend (as she saith) approaches her, she strikes very fiercely at him, and shows some Hair hid about her for that purpose to the People, which she makes them believe (and they credit) that she hath broke the Devils Head, and pull'd those Locks from it; and for this her trouble she receives a Red Strip'd Garment, and so departs: But if the Distemper still continues, and that there is no sign of amendment, they send again for the Priestess, who coming thither, saith, <HI>That the Devil loves the House, and therein intends to dwell;</HI> Whereupon, being desir'd to drive him from thence, and also her Re|ward shew'd her, she takes a Spade, Digs a Hole in several places of the House, and pulls out some more Hair which she hath hid, crying aloud to all the standers by, that she hath had the Devil by the Head, and that that is his Hair; then seeming to force him out of the House, with many scurrilous Exclama|tions.</P>
<P>After all endeavors us'd in vain, and that their Stiches and Pains no way abate, then they commit them to their gods; but when they are ready to yield up the Ghost, they pour so much strong Liquor down their Throats, that run|ning out at their Mouth and Nostrils, it drowns and suffocates: Thus having fetch'd the last Gasp, all those that are about him cry out with a lamentable voice, making strange Gesticulations, clapping, and stamping with their Hands and Feet; and to give notice that one is dead in the Town, they go up and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mourning for the Dead.</NOTE> down Tabering upon one of their Drums; which done, and the Corps wash'd in warm Water, his best Clothes are put on, adorn'd with Bracelets and other Ornaments, his Weapons laid by him, and Rice and <HI>Masakhaw</HI> proffer'd to him, all which lie two days by the Body; which if they should not do, his Soul (they say) would be angry: Likewise they kill a Hog for his Provision, to supply his long Journey, and then they offer the Corps up to their gods: Before the House they set up a long Cane, with a Pennon on the top, and near it a great Tub with Water, for the Soul to Bathe in: Against the Even|ing, all the Friends come thither, accompany'd with most of the Towns-men, every one with a Pot of <HI>Masakhaw;</HI> the nearest of Kin to the Deceas'd, lay themselves down by the Corps, and making a mournful complaint, utter these words; <HI>Why didst thou die? why didst thou leave us? What hurt, what harm have we done thee? O my Son, my loving Child come hither to us, and stay with us; If you will not, take us to your self, since we are ready to die and follow you; What shall we do without you? what do we do here after you?</HI></P>
<P>To increase their sorrow, the Women make a very doleful noise, by tram|pling and tabering with their Feet on a hollow Trough before the Door, at which the standers by cry, <HI>Hark, how the Trees bemoan the loss of this Man.</HI> This stamping on the Trough, is by them call'd <HI>Smaghdakdaken:</HI> They also hire se|veral Women which sit constantly crying by the Corps, and sometimes make
<PB N="30" REF="17">
sad Complaints, and Sing mournful Elegies which they name <HI>Temulidid&punc;</HI> These Women likewise pray to the gods, that the Soul may have a good place in Heaven, and find a new Wife and Friends there: The young Men, in the mean time running up and down with Rattles in their Hands.</P>
<P>After the Corps hath lain two days on Rushes, they bring it to a place call'd <HI>Takay,</HI> where they wash it several times with warm Water; but if a rich Per|son, with <HI>Masakhaw,</HI> then scrape it so long, till pieces of Flesh and Skin hang&punc; dangling about it. Lastly, they make a gentle fire nine days under the Corps&punc; which Roasting by degrees, occasions a horrible stench.</P>
<P>The Body thus Broyl'd is wound up in a Mat, and laid again on the Rushes as before; then they make a great Feast call'd <HI>Gahalhal,</HI> killing ten or twelve Swine, some for offerings to the gods, others for <HI>Taghimihe,</HI> or Provisions for the departed Souls Journey.</P>
<P>Some of this Pork is cut in small pieces, and serv'd about to the Mourners; at that time the House is fill'd with Men and Women, every one with a Pot of <HI>Masakhaw,</HI> all which sometimes Weep, and sometimes Drink, till they are all Maudlin-Drunk; they mix a strange complaint with horrid confusion: Then the nearest Relations go again to the Corps, and make the foremention'd com|plaints, <HI>why he dy'd, &amp;c.</HI> If it be the body of a rich Person, it is kept some years before it is Bury'd, and serv'd every day as if living, setting fresh Meat and Drink before it.</P>
<P>If the Deceas'd dy'd a Batchellor, then they relate all the Heroick Exploits which he perform'd in his Life time, and the number of his slain Enemies; over his Head they hang a Cane, with as many Notches in it as he hath kill'd Men. Lastly, they carry the Dead to the common Burying-place, close by their Temples, where some must watch nine or ten days, for they certainly be|lieve that the Devil watches about him all that time; after the ten days expired, their Friends go thither with Rattles, and Boughs of <HI>Pisang</HI> Trees, with fire in their Hands, making a terrible noise, under pretence to hunt the Devil from thence. The Wife to the Deceased (if he leaves one behind him) Prays before him so long as he lies in the House, desiring the gods, that they would be kind and merciful to him. And while the Corps is above the Ground, the House may not be swept, but when the Corps is carry'd out, and the House swept, the Woman that did it must throw away the Broom towards the South, saying, <HI>Who owes the House?</HI> whereupon answering her self, <HI>It doth not belong to me nor us, what then have we to do with this House?</HI></P>
<P>These People observe seven Solemn times as Festivals with great Ceremo|nies:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seven Feasts.</NOTE></P>
<P>The first call'd <HI>Trepaupoe Lakkang,</HI> which begins at the latter end of <HI>April,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">First.</NOTE> and is kept by the Sea side, whither both Young and Old, Rich and Poor, flock in great multitudes: Here their Priestess pretends to speak with, and re|ceive Answers from their gods, offering them Swines-flesh, Rice, <HI>Masakhaw,</HI> and <HI>Pisang,</HI> with Prayers to send them store of Rain for the forwarding the growth of their Corn, or if it be already grown, to keep it from hurtful Winds.</P>
<P>After their Sacrifices ended, they sit down about the same place, and fall a Drinking to excess; while the ancient men standing on a row every one with a whole Reed in one hand, and a Lance in the other, sprinkle them with <HI>Masak|haw.</HI> In their Huts they discourse of all their Villanies committed, or brag who hath slain the most of their Enemies, and brought home their Heads as
<PB N="31" REF="17">
Trophies; but he that hath done the most work in Harvest, is accounted the bravest Fellow.</P>
<P>The second Feast call'd <HI>Warabo Lang Varolbo,</HI> that is, <HI>Tying Fast,</HI> they generally<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second Feast.</NOTE> hold in <HI>Iune,</HI> against which they observe their Dreams, and Singing of the Birds.</P>
<P>At the day of Offering they rise very early, and make themselves ready for the Work, both Men and Women, with great Zeal; the Women first Conse|crate the Irons with which they Weed; the Basket in which they carry their Caps, likewise the <HI>Callabashes,</HI> Rings, Bracelets, Chests, the Front of the House and Bridge; Praying also to the gods <HI>Tamagisangak,</HI> and <HI>Tekaroepada</HI> for good Fortune, and security against Fire, and to be their Defence against Poysonous and Voracious Beasts; all which they do before they go out.</P>
<P>The Men Pray to the gods <HI>Topoliap</HI> and <HI>Takavoelie,</HI> and offer them <HI>Masakhaw,</HI> boyl'd Rice, <HI>Pinang, Siri,</HI> and Swines flesh, begging of them in time of War, to defend them against their Enemies, to sharpen their Swords, Arrows, and <HI>Assa|gays;</HI> and lastly, to harden their Bodies against their Adversaries, Darts, and Arrows.</P>
<P>Then both Men and Women, but most of the Female Sex go to their Priestess call'd <HI>Ibis,</HI> to whom they shew great Reverence and Obedience; some years ago there was a certain <HI>Ibis</HI> call'd <HI>Tiladam Tuaka,</HI> which was us'd to per|form many abominable Ceremonies at this Feast, <HI>viz.</HI> She climb'd on the Roof of the Temple, where she stood in sight of all the People, then began to tell them, that the gods would have taken her to them from the Temple; which done, she call'd for the Drink-Offerings, and holding a great Pot with Liquor in both Hands, said, <HI>That the gods, unless she did so, would not drink;</HI> then being drunk, she pull'd off all her Clothes, <HI>Because the Children of God,</HI> said she, <HI>cannot enter into Heaven with any Earthly Robes.</HI> Thus standing in sight of all People, she began to evacuate what she had so greedily swallow'd, saying, <HI>That the gods, according to the quantity of her Vomit, would send them Rain;</HI> whereupon the People force upon her more Liquor, that they may have plenty of Rain: If the Priestess chances to Urine thorow the Roof of the Church, then the Spectators promise to themselves a fruitful year, but if not, great scarcity, so that they often drink the more to satisfie the People; then bidding the whole Congre|gation look up, she Tabors on her private parts a considerable time, which Taboring the Spectators observe with as much Zeal, as in our Countrey the Auditors give ear to the Preaching of a Sermon.</P>
<P>Lastly, coming down, she falls flat on the ground, and begins to roar and foam, rolling too and again, and spreading her Hands and Feet, then lies still a while, as in a Trance; her associates come to lift her up, but seem to have met with too weighty a burthen; yet at last recovering, after she hath made a small Speech to the People, her Companions lead her into the Temple, where she drinks her self dead Drunk; all which impudent debaucheries, as they say, are done to the honor of their gods, to grant them store of Rain, and a plentiful Harvest.</P>
<P>All the Women must appear naked at this Feast, except their Privacies, which they cover with a <HI>Kagpay,</HI> that is, a little piece of Cloath; so also must the Men: When they have drunk out all their Liquor at the Temple, the Congregation goes home, where they Drink till the Morning, and walk from house to house, committing all manner of Villanies, not fearing to lie with, or vitiate their Sisters and Daughters.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="18">The third Feast call'd <HI>Sickariariang,</HI> they keep in <HI>Iune;</HI> the manner thus:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Third Feast.</NOTE></P>
<P>After every one hath done their Private Devotions in their Houses, and as they say, spoke with the gods, they make themselves ready to go to the general place of Sacrifice near the Sea. The Men walk stark naked, but the Women have a small Clout before them. At their general Assembly, the Priestess offers to the gods, of whom they now request, that they may be strengthen'd against their Enemies; and the Women, that the Corn be preserv'd from Tempests and Wild Beasts.</P>
<P>Amongst all other, this is the most Celebrated, because it is as one of <HI>Bacchus</HI> and <HI>Venus</HI>'s Feasts; so that it differs much and exceeds the rest, in perpetrating unheard of Abominations, both night and day: The young Men are comman|ded by the Magistrates of the Town, to go naked to this Feast, and to exercise themselves with Running, and Martial Discipline, which they willingly per|form.</P>
<P>The fourth nam'd <HI>Lingout,</HI> begins in Harvest, and kept also on the Sea shore,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fourth Feast.</NOTE> near the mouth of a River: Hither also both Men and Women going naked, pray to the gods for Rain, to keep the Corn in the Ears, to banish Storms and Tempests, which very frequently rise in that Moneth. Great villanies are committed at this Feast. The Youths are stuck and hung with green Boughs and Garlands, and so adorn'd, must run Races with Rattles in their Hands; he that gets first to the River wins the Wager, and by the Maidens is conducted and carry'd over, where he enjoys the handsomest of them at his pleasure.</P>
<P>The fifth Feast call'd <HI>Piniang,</HI> is kept in <HI>October,</HI> at which time the Magistrates<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fifth Feast.</NOTE> have a piece of Wood cut in the fashion of a Tortoise-shell, ty'd to their Bo|dies, whereupon in the Night, with their whole Congregation, they walk Drumming and Shouting up and down the Town. At this Feast they come all clothed to their place of Offering, to run about with the artificial Shell, which is first perform'd by those whose Parents are yet living, then by those that are Orphans. This Feast is no less polluted by vicious performances than the other.</P>
<P>The sixth they name <HI>Itaoungang:</HI> At this Feastival the old and young Men ap|pear<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sixth Feast.</NOTE> in peculiar Habits, and have a pretty way of moving their Hands and Feet, Capering, and hitting their Feet one against another, and likewise act se|veral Postures with their Hands; besides many other Ceremonies, too long here to relate. This continues two days, meeting both Morning and Evening, at the sound of the artificial Tortoise-shell; after they have perform'd their se|veral Offerings to their Deities, they fall a Drinking, in which they spend the whole Night.</P>
<P>The seventh Feast call'd <HI>Korouloutaen,</HI> is kept in <HI>November</HI> with great Solem|nity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Seventh Feast.</NOTE> At the time of this Feast they adorn their Arms and Heads with white Feathers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Formosans</HI> (except those by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> converted to <HI>Christianity</HI>) believe not in God, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, but Worship thirteen Idols.</P>
<P>The first and chiefest is call'd <HI>Tamagisangak,</HI> and resides in the West part of Heaven.</P>
<P>The other his Wife, <HI>Takaroepada,</HI> and dwells over against him in the East: both these are by them accounted for their powerfullest gods, and reverenc'd with great Devotion; for if any War lay desolate their Cities, or Sickness and Famine oppress the People, they say all proceeds from the neglect of their duty in worshipping these gods.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="18">The third God call'd <HI>Tamagisangak</HI> reigns in the South, and shapes handsome People, as the fourth his heavenly Consort <HI>Teckarupada,</HI> in the East gives growth to Corn and Field-Fruits; they say, these Deities have the ordering of Mans Life, wherefore the Women present them with Seeds and Plants: They believe likewise that Thunder is the Goddess <HI>Teckarupada</HI>'s voice, chiding at her Hus|band for not sending Rain timely upon the Earth, and he always, when thus ratled up by his thundering Wife, delays not to send Rain in abundance.</P>
<P>The fifth God call'd <HI>Tugittellaegh,</HI> and his Queen <HI>Tagisikel</HI> the sixth, have the cure of the Sick, and are worshipp'd by them.</P>
<P>The seventh Deity being <HI>Tiwarakahoeloe,</HI> and the eighth <HI>Tamakakamak,</HI> are chiefly reverenc'd by such as frequent the Woods and Forest, to hunt and kill wild Beasts.</P>
<P>The ninth call'd <HI>Tapaliat,</HI> and the other <HI>Tatawoeli,</HI> govern all Martial Affairs, and are for the most part invok'd by Soldiers.</P>
<P>The eleventh nam'd <HI>Takarye,</HI> and the twelfth <HI>Tamakading,</HI> preside their annual Feasts, and punish the omission of their long setled Customs.</P>
<P>The thirteenth <HI>Farikhe,</HI> they say resides in the North, they esteem him a cross|grain'd and ill natur'd God, whose business is to deform what ever nature makes Comely, and therefore onely worship him that he may not mis-shape them.</P>
<P>The Natives relate, that this last God was formerly a Man living in <HI>Sinkam,</HI> very fierce, and of a stern Countenance, with an exceeding long Nose, which caus'd the People so to mock at him, that growing impatient to bear such in|dignities any longer, he desir'd of the Gods to take him amongst them, which was immediately granted; that after some stay there, he descended again, and gave his Countrey-men twenty seven Articles or Commandments, charging to observe them strictly, threatning, that if they neglected, he would send upon them many and great Plagues. These Commandments they keep ten days together every Month, beginning when the Moon enters <HI>Aries,</HI> which time is by them call'd <HI>Karichang&punc;</HI> of which Laws more hereafter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Formosans</HI> are very slothful, and Till but little, although they possess much fruitful and rich Land. None dare be so bold to Sowe his Ground, be|fore he hath offer'd two Hogs at <HI>Tamacuwalo</HI> and <HI>Tamabal,</HI> chief Houses belong|ing to the third and fourth Gods, <HI>Teckarupada,</HI> and <HI>Tamagisangak;</HI> and this Ob|lation is requir'd by one of the Priests belonging to the same Houses. In like manner, the Oldest of the Village, when it Rains, bring a Hog, and abun|dance of <HI>Masakhaw</HI> to the Priests that dwell in those two Houses, to be offer'd to their Gods.</P>
<P>If at their going to Sowe their Fields, they chance to meet a wild Beast, and kill it, they carry the Liver and Heart as a Victim, to their Gods in the two Houses; and when all the People are assembled, the Priests of the two Houses must first Sowe a small spot of Ground, and then all the rest may proceed, ha|ving first laid between two Bundles of Straw, by them call'd <HI>Tenguro,</HI> a <HI>Pisang</HI> Leaf, a little <HI>Siri</HI> and Lime, to be offer'd to their Gods.</P>
<P>The Seed being put into the Ground, a Rice Pot, in their Language call'd <HI>Sangi,</HI> is placed on the North side of the two Houses, and left there till the Rice hath attain'd its full growth.</P>
<P>If the Corn near the Pots (for close by them they Sowe a little) grows well, they take them away with great joy, and freely believe, that they shall have a kindly and plentiful Harvest.</P>
<P>They are not permitted to take Tobacco in the Seed-time, lest (as their
<PB N="34" REF="19">
Priestesses tell them) all their Seed should turn into that stinking Vapor. The are forbidden in that time to throw the Bones of Salt Fish, or Peels of Onions on the Ground; but must carry them in a <HI>Talangack,</HI> or Pot, into the Woods, to prevent the devouring of their Corn by Poysonous Serpents.</P>
<P>They must keep no Fire, lest the Corn should be burnt. Sugar-Canes or Pomegranates they may eat onely in the Evening; but they may not during that Season taste any Roast-meat, for fear the Corn should be set on Fire by wild Swine; nor any <HI>Mahall,</HI> that is, Powder'd Flesh, lest it should be devour'd by Worms: They must also abstain from <HI>Kanging</HI> and a <HI>Hay,</HI> both Fishes, because they believe, if they should eat of them, that the Corn would have no Ears.</P>
<P>They conceit, That if they should sleep in the Field during their Seed-time, their Corn would not grow upright, but lodge on the Ground; and if they drink any Water, except mix'd with <HI>Masakhaw,</HI> that the Grain would never ripen, but be green and watery.</P>
<P>If the Dust or Sand happen to light in ones Eyes, he may not endeavor to get it out by rubbing, or otherwise, till he has quit the Field they have sown.</P>
<P>They never cut their Corn before they have made Offerings to their Gods.</P>
<P>If a Thorn chances to get in any ones Foot, he must not pull it out in the Field, but must leave the Place.</P>
<P>No Woman may turn her back Parts to a Man, nor go naked.</P>
<P>Many more ridiculous Customs they use during the Seed-time, which are strictly observ'd by them; as, when the Corn is ready to be cut, they thresh one Bundle, and laying a Lump of Earth upon it, implore the Gods to fill and make weighty the Ears of all the rest.</P>
<P>After they have brought in the Corn to their particular Houses, they offer a Swine, and use many Ceremonies in the killing of it; amongst others, they lay a great piece of Clay on a large black Pot, which they firmly believe makes their Corn grow more full and weighty.</P>
<P>Their Hunting, which is never less than twelve days together, is perform'd<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hunting.</NOTE> sometimes by few, and at other times with many People, who for the most part use Snares and Canes, and also <HI>Assagays,</HI> Bowes, and Arrows. When they have appointed a great Match, they build a House in the Fields, which they call <HI>Cadelang,</HI> wherein they hang all their Implements.</P>
<P>And as they have their third and fourth Gods that look over their Tillage, so their seventh and eighth, nam'd <HI>Tawarakakoeloe,</HI> and <HI>Tamakakamak,</HI> bear the sway in Hunting. Before they go out, they tell to one another the Dreams they had in the Preceding Night, and also neglect not Augurial Observations; insomuch that if the Bird <HI>Aydak</HI> meet them, they count it a good <HI>Omen;</HI> but if it flies either on the right or left side of them, they put off their Venating Sport till some other time.</P>
<P>Others also go to a River side, where they make a peculiar kind of Sacri|fice to their Gods, with these Words, <HI>If the Devil, or any other Evil Spirits follow us, we beseech that you would drive and banish them from us.</HI></P>
<P>From the first Quarry of every sort of Wild Creatures, they take a snip from the Tail, Mouth, Heart, and Kidneys, which with a <HI>Pisang</HI> Leaf, scalded Rice, and <HI>Masakhaw,</HI> they present to their Deities.</P>
<P>Coming back from their Recreation, they return thanks to the Gods, in the House which they built to put their Arms, and Hunting-necessaries in, praying, That those which come after them may have no success, nor kill any thing.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="19">Lastly, They pull down and burn the House, having first sent for the Wo|men to carry home the taken Venison, who coming thither, bring abundance of cheering Tope to make merry with.</P>
<P>They often kill at one of these great Hunting-Matches, eight hundred, a thousand, nay, sometimes two thousand Head of Deer; so that the <HI>Nether|landers</HI> could buy there the best and fattest Hanch of Venison for a Shilling.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Formosans</HI> much differ from one another in their Speech, so that you<NOTE PLACE="marg">Language.</NOTE> shall seldom find two or three Villages, though but three or four Leagues di|stant from one another, but their Dialects vary so much, that they are forc'd to use Interpreters.</P>
<P>They have neither Letters, Writings, nor Books, neither were willing to learn, although both the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> have offer'd to teach and in|struct them.</P>
<P>The Islands <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Tayowan</HI> lay very convenient for the <HI>Netherlanders Chinese</HI> Trade, because at most Seasons of the Year they could sail to them from the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> out of the River <HI>Chinch,</HI> or <HI>Chinchieu.</HI></P>
<P>The chiefest Merchandise which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> got at <HI>Formosa,</HI> consisted in Sugar, Goats and Deers Skins, which they transported thence to <HI>Iapan.</HI></P>
<P>The Companies Merchandise was carried in <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonks to the River <HI>Chin|chieu,</HI> and the City <HI>Eymuy,</HI> to their Factors or Merchants residing there, and also to other peculiar <HI>Chinese&punc;</HI>Merchants, whose Credit was good, to send them such Returns as were desired at <HI>Iapan, India,</HI> and the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> which Trade was conniv'd at by the <HI>Koabon</HI> of the Territory <HI>Fokien.</HI> There also came some pe|culiar Merchants out of <HI>China,</HI> with their own Vessels, to dispose of their pri|vate Merchandise, though of small concern: Therefore when the time ap|proach'd, that the Ships were to go Annually to <HI>Iapan</HI> or <HI>Batavia,</HI> and that the Goods came but slowly from <HI>China,</HI> they were necessitated to go themselves with two or three Vessels to <HI>China</HI> or <HI>Eymuy,</HI> where the Goods were brought, weigh'd, and receiv'd aboard in several Parcels, and were forc'd to give eight or ten <HI>Tail</HI> more on a <HI>Picol</HI> of Silk, than&punc; otherwise; each <HI>Tail</HI> valued at about five Shil|lings <HI>Sterling,</HI> and a <HI>Picol,</HI> a hundred twenty five Pound weight.</P>
<P>The <HI>Formosans</HI> observe a Time, which they call <HI>Karichang,</HI> very strictly, ab|staining from several things while it lasteth.</P>
<P>This <HI>Karichang</HI> comes every Month once, which is when the Moon (as we mention'd before) enters our Vernal Sign <HI>Aries.</HI> It was, they say, first consti|tuted by one that liv'd in <HI>Sinkan,</HI> call'd <HI>Fariche Fikrigo Gon-go-Sey,</HI> being of a very stern Countenance, with a long Nose, for which, mock'd and derided by all his Acquaintance: He therefore tyr'd with their continual gybes and jeer|ing, having still one fling or other at his Nose, desir'd the Gods that they would please to take him from this wicked World, and place him in Heaven; which being, as they say, granted, after some time he descended again on the Earth, where he commanded the People, as a punishment for their former de|rision, strictly to observe the following twenty seven Commandments, which if omitted, he threatned them with severe Punishments.</P>

<P><HI>ANno</HI> 1652. the seventh of <HI>September,</HI> the <HI>Chineses</HI> of <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa</HI> being then under the <HI>Hollanders</HI> obedience, depending on the great numbers of their People, broke out into Rebellion, led by <HI>Fayet,</HI> a Ruler of <HI>Smeerdorp,</HI> lying two Leagues from <HI>Sakam,</HI> with a design to surprise or force the Castle of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> which thus they contriv'd, <HI>viz.</HI> To invite the Governor <HI>Nicholas Verburgh,</HI> with all the Officers and chiefest of the Merchants residing in the City <HI>Zelandia,</HI> to their Full-Moon Feast, resolving when they were in the midst of all their Mirth, to dispatch them in a general Massacre.</P>
<P>This done, they intended to march to the Castle, under pretence to bring the Governor home, and upon the opening of the Castle-Gate, to press in upon them, and so Master it.</P>
<P>But one <HI>Pau,</HI> a <HI>Chinese</HI> Commander, who dwelt in <HI>Zelandia,</HI> and Brother to <HI>Fayet,</HI> the Chief Leader of the Conspirators, disputing with his Brother the probability of carrying on the Plot, said, <HI>The Design is good, very good, and may be brought to effect; but if we should fail, and the Plot be discover'd, and these Devils the</HI> Hollanders <HI>get the better, what will become of us then? You shall not suffer onely, and the Party that you have engag'd; but thousands of Innocents, that knew nothing, shall scarce satiate their Revenge with their miserable Slaughter.</HI> To which their Ge|neral <HI>Fayet</HI> replied, <HI>Brother, if you are not satisfied, and your Fear overcome your Iudgement, you are at your Liberty to dispose of your self; be Neuter, go to your Ha|bitation, and which way soever the Victory falls, there you may in safety, and unsuspected, enjoy your Freedom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pau</HI> having receiv'd this Reply, departed, musing as he went, but at last re|solv'd to discover the Plot, and make himself secure indeed. Coming there|fore to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> near the Castle, he desired the Serjeant to admit him to speak privately with the Governor; but the negligent, left <HI>Pau</HI> waiting with a slight Answer, the Governor and the rest being then at Prayers: But he more im|portunate, and big with so great a Business, by earnest solliciting was let in to the Governor, to whom he discover'd all: At which <HI>Verburgh</HI> the Governor being startled, first commanded to secure <HI>Pau</HI> in the Castle, and sent an Officer with eight Men to <HI>Smeerdorp,</HI> as Spies, and to inquire News; who brought word back, that the <HI>Chineses</HI> were already gotten into a Head, and that setting upon them, they had escap'd by flight. At this Alarm, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> that had setled in <HI>Sakam,</HI> being to the number of thirty, in great fear fled for safe|ty to the Forts.</P>
<P><HI>Fayet,</HI> who judg'd Delays dangerous, and doubting that his Brother would, or had discover'd the Plot, march'd with his Forces to <HI>Sakam,</HI> where falling without mercy upon the Town with Fire and Sword, he gave no Quarter to any.</P>
<P>A Gardener belonging to the <HI>Dutch,</HI> going on that <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning early with a Basket of Fruit to the Governor, in the Castle <HI>Tayowan,</HI> the Revolters
<PB N="38" REF="21">
overtaking him, cut off his Head, and taking out the Fruits, laid it in the Bas|ket, designing to have sent it before them; but the Humor altering, they cast both it and the Body under a Bridge. The News of this Massacre spreading a strange Fear seiz'd all the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> where-ever setled through the Country, so that dispersing, they hid themselves where-ever their Fear carried, or their Hopes led them, to escape the Slaughter. But one Captain <HI>Marine,</HI> well mounted, with three more, with their Swords in their Hands, broke through the Enemy, and killing the first that oppos'd him, came safe to <HI>Tayowan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Verburgh</HI> the Governor well knowing how untowardly the Business stood, and the hazard wherein the <HI>Hollanders</HI> abroad were, lying open to destructi|on, immediately sent out a hundred and twenty Men, commanded by Captain <HI>Danker.</HI> This Handful, in comparison of their Enemies great Forces, went in one Sloop and a Boat from <HI>Tayowan</HI> to <HI>Sakam,</HI> whither being come, the first that endeavor'd to Land, being Captain <HI>Hans Pieters,</HI> leap'd Breast-high into the Water, by which Example, the rest encourag'd, forsook their Boats, and resolv'd wading to fight their way to the Shore; which the Enemy observing, sent down with the Lieutenant-General a thousand Men, to oppose their Land|ing. While they were thus drawing up towards the Shore for the Service, <HI>Fayet</HI> the General gave his Lieutenant <HI>Loukegwa</HI> new Orders, thinking it more fit to suffer them to Land, saying, <HI>It would be a higher pleasure to him to see the Christian Dogs die on the Land, than in the Water, which would be much the better sport, having them there inviron'd with his Army, as in a Net.</HI> But <HI>Loukegwa</HI> not so perswa|ded, nor willing to receive these new Commands, earnestly advis'd the Gene|ral that he might go on, and set upon them in the Water, averring, That these being the <HI>Hollanders</HI> choicest and pick'd Men, if they did not cut them off at this Advantage, they should never have the like: But however the Generals Opinion prevailing, he obey'd, and retreating, gave the opportunity of Land|ing in safety; where a little towards the left Hand of the Enemy, he drew up his small Party into a Body, when a <HI>Negro</HI> that had married a <HI>Hollander,</HI> com|ing out of a Wood where she had hid, running for her safety towards them, they intercepting, ripp'd up her Bowels, and cutting the Child in pieces, threw the Limbs at them, vaporing aloud, <HI>That so they would serve them all.</HI> But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> not replying, march'd boldly up to the Front of the Enemy, where in the first Charge killing fortunately their Prime Commander <HI>Fayet,</HI> which presently nois'd through the Army, all struck with a Panick fear, threw down their Arms, and disbanding, fled, shifting for themselves; but the <HI>Hollanders</HI> pursu'd, firing at their Heels through <HI>Sakam,</HI> and the Town clear'd, they sate down in their Enemies Head-Quarters: But before Night, while yet they were triumphing for the Victory, came two thousand <HI>Christian Formosans,</HI> rais'd by the Governor <HI>Verburgh,</HI> to their Aid, who, according to present Orders, march'd together in pursuit of the Enemy, some few of whom the next morn|ing they spied drawn together upon a rising Ground, but a River betwixt im|peded their present Charge; but soon after the <HI>Formosans,</HI> who knew the Fords and Avenues, got over, and charging them smartly, one being slain, they were suddenly dissipated; which Victory they and the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> pursu'd, making Execution till Sun-set, from whence returning to their Camp weary and hun|gry, they found store of fresh Provisions, boyl'd and roast, with which they feasting, were refresh'd.</P>
<P>Thus the Enemy dispers'd, and their whole Design frustrate, <HI>Fayet</HI>'s Lieu|tenant, having sculk'd in the Mountains eight days, enforc'd at last by necessi|ty

<P>Two Years after this War, <HI>Anno</HI> 1645. in <HI>May,</HI> came abundance of Locusts<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Plague of Locusts.</NOTE> out of the North-West of the Isles, which devouring all the Fruits of the Field, occasion'd so great a Famine, that eight thousand Persons died of Hunger. These Locusts were of a strange shape, having a Back and Breast like a Pike|man, and an Helmet on their Heads, such as Soldiers wear. They made an affrighting noise with their Wings in their flight, as if it had blown a Storm.</P>
<P>They flew from the Island <HI>Tayowan</HI> to <HI>Formosa,</HI> where they staid three Months, and at last took their Progress from thence, towards the North-West, from whence they came at first, on <HI>Sunday</HI> the ninth of <HI>August</HI> about Sun-set: Yet though they were gone, the fear of that Plague was no ways abated; for they left young ones behind, which were far worse than the old&punc; eating up all that remain'd; yet by the Industry of the Inhabitants, with the Governors Order, most part of them being not fledg'd, were taken and destroy'd.</P>

The way to|wards the South was also more built and inhabited than formerly; but they could see but twenty four small Vessels, which were most <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">A sort of small Ves|sels.</NOTE> <HI>Koyaes,</HI> that lay within the Haven, under the Forts.</P>
<P>Most of the Inhabitants of <HI>Tayowan</HI> are at present Out-law'd <HI>Chineses,</HI> which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inhabitants.</NOTE> first rebell'd against their Native Emperor, and since will not acknowledge the <HI>Tartar;</HI> who taking both <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa, Anno</HI> 1661. from the <HI>Hollan|der,</HI> brought all under the Subjection of their General <HI>Coxinga.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> on both these Isles, and those that live in <HI>China,</HI> differ onely in the wearing of their Hair long, and braided, after the old <HI>Chinese</HI> manner; which following the <HI>Tartars,</HI> they now wear short in <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>And as the <HI>Formosans</HI> have several Gods which they worship, so have like|wise the <HI>Chineses</HI> inhabiting these Islands: Our Author, <HI>David Wright&punc;</HI> reckons seventy two in the following Discourse.</P>
<P>They acknowledge one Almighty God, Governor of Heaven, Earth, Sea, Sun, Moon, and Stars, whom they call <HI>Ty,</HI> and look upon him as the Supream and first Deity. They make Offerings to this great God, yet but once a year, at which time they sacrifice a Wild Boar, burning alive with <HI>Sandal</HI>-wood; for to offer this their Almighty any thing but Swines Flesh, they account Abomination.</P>
<P>The next whom they worship is call'd <HI>Tien Sho,</HI> and <HI>Ioch Koung Shang Tee,</HI> who is the second Person or Governor of Heaven; wherefore he is nam'd <HI>Tien Sho,</HI> that is, <HI>The second Person of Heaven;</HI> and <HI>Ioch Koung Shang Tee,</HI> that is, <HI>Governor of the Earth.</HI> He commands three ministerial Spirits more: The first is <HI>Heu|oung,</HI> that is, <HI>The Ruler of Rain.</HI></P>
<P>The second Aerial Spirit, <HI>Teoung,</HI> hath Power over all Living Creatures, whether Rational, Sensitive, or Vegetative.</P>
<P>The third Spirit, and eighth Deity, call'd <HI>Tsuy Zyen Tei Oung,</HI> that is, <HI>Com|mander of the Sea, and of all that is therein, or upon.</HI></P>
<P>The third Person in Heaven the <HI>Chineses</HI> call <HI>Iok Tie,</HI> who was formerly a Prince on Earth, but so righteous, that he was taken up to Heaven for his Pi|ety and Justice.</P>
<P>The fourth God they stile <HI>Quanoung,</HI> who also was formerly a Prince; and likewise the fifth, whom they call <HI>Iamoung;</HI> but both of them were after|wards for their meritorious Actions taken up to Heaven.</P>
<P>To these five Gods, being as Chief in the Government of Heaven, belongs
<PB N="41" REF="24">
the three foremention'd ministring aerial Spirits, and are indeed, though Dei|ties themselves, subservient to the first five, making up eight Gods.</P>
<P>Besides these eight Gods, there are twenty eight Councellors, or Ministers of State, which have formerly been Learned Philosophers, and now preferr'd to the Government of the Stars.</P>
<P>Moreover, the <HI>Chineses</HI> have many Demy-gods, or terrestrial Deities, which ascend every year to Heaven, there to intercede and gain Indulgence for the sins committed by Mankind all the year past.</P>
<P>The first of these is rather a Nymph, or Demy-goddess, and being the thirty seventh, goes by the Name of <HI>Potsou,</HI> and is represented in the shape of a Wo|man with a Child in her Arms, and was, as the <HI>Chineses</HI> believe, a Kings Daughter, a great Prophetess, and a Virgin that bore a Child and not impreg|nated: which Fatherless Child they nam'd <HI>Bachu;</HI> who coming to years of perfection, was also a great Exemplar of Prudence and Magnanimity; yet not so much look'd upon, or worshipp'd as the Mother. They make her also to have a Servant call'd <HI>Pausat,</HI> a very antient Man.</P>
<P>There are some Traditions amongst them, that this <HI>Heroine</HI> is not a Native of <HI>China,</HI> but born in a foreign Countrey: Others again conjecture, that she is the same with the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and the old Man, her reputed Servant, is in|deed her Husband <HI>Ioseph;</HI> but the vicissitudes of affairs and time have left us nothing of the truth of this fabulous Tradition.</P>
<P>The thirty eighth terrestrial <HI>Numen</HI> they instile <HI>Quanien;</HI> but <HI>Paulus Venetus&punc; Quamina;</HI> and <HI>Iohannes Gonsales, Quianira,</HI> who said that she was the Daughter of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperor <HI>Tzonton,</HI> which built the Wall between <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Tartary.</HI> But this Opinion <HI>David Wright</HI> explodes, making her the Daugh|ter of the Emperor <HI>Biou Tsongong,</HI> which Reigned many years before the first Emperor <HI>Quantekong,</HI> presently after the Deluge, which he thus endeavors to prove.</P>
<P><HI>This</HI> Biou Tsongong (says he) <HI>had three Daughters, two of which he had bestowed on Husbands, but the third,</HI> Quanien, <HI>he could not prevail with to enter into that Estate, although her Father had selected for her a Companion worthy her Love and Esteem: but seeing her no ways inclin'd to it, he resolv'd to put her into a Cloister; where to humble her, he commanded the Overseers to put her to do the Drudgery of the House,</HI> viz. <HI>fetch in Wa|ter and Wood, and make it clean. But the Swans, as the Chronicles of</HI> China <HI>relate, came from the Mountains, and the Angels from Heaven to help her to carry Water, and the Beasts out of the Forrests brought Wood for her. Her Father inform'd thereof, judging she did those things by Magick, was very much enraged, and commanded the Cloister to be set on fire. The Daughter observing that she onely was the occasion thereof, thought to make her self away. But the Heavens pittying her innocency, commanded</HI> Hevong <HI>the God of Rain, to send down such an impetuous Shower as might quench the Fire, now beginning to rage in the Cloister as bad as her Father in his frantick fury, which was accordingly per|form'd. Nevertheless</HI> Quanien <HI>sled to the Mountains, where she continued a great while. Her Father in the interim by Divine Providence was struck with Leprosie, and almost de|vour'd alive by Worms, no Physitians or Medicines being able to cure him: Of which his Daughter having at last some knowledge, touch'd with a natural affection, and feeling as it were in her self her Fathers misery, came and cur'd him; which so wrought upon the old Man, that through an excess of joy converting his rage into a contrary passion, he would have worshipped her; but she refusing such honour, bad him return thanks to Heaven and the Gods; which he ceased not to do, after that becoming a zealous Penitent. Not long af|ter</HI> Biou Tsongong <HI>dy'd, and</HI> Quanien <HI>betook her self to</HI> Lamhay, <HI>a Place in</HI> China,
<PB N="42" REF="25">
<HI>where she spent the remainder of her Life in great Piety. After her Death they built a stately Temple in honor of her, and Interr'd her Corps in the middle, which remains at this day (as the</HI> Chineses <HI>believe) as fresh and sound, as if it had been buried but a day. Every year the Priests go thither to celebrate the Anniversary of her Death, in the sixth Moon, on the eighteenth day, with Sports and Feasting, which hath won so much esteem, that the</HI> Chineses <HI>implore her help and assistance in all Tribulations.</HI></P>
<P>The thirty ninth Goddess is call'd <HI>Nioma,</HI> or as others will have it, <HI>Matzou;</HI> she was born in the City <HI>Kotzo,</HI> in the Territory of <HI>Houkong,</HI> where her Father was Vice-Roy. This <HI>Nioma</HI> resolving also to live and die a Virgin, to that end went to dwell in the Island <HI>Piscadores,</HI> or <HI>Fishers-Isle,</HI> otherwise by the Inha|bitants call'd <HI>Pehoe,</HI> lying to the Northward, twelve Leagues distant from <HI>For|mosa,</HI> where she spent her Life in a Pious and most Religious manner. Her Image not long after was set up in the Temple with two Servants, one on the right, and another on the left-side, each of them holding a Fan in their Hands, which cover'd the Goddesses Head. She hath also (as they say) Spirits under her command, and is highly honor'd amongst the <HI>Chineses</HI> for so great and powerful a Deity, that all the Emperors at their Inaugurations must not omit to pay their Devotions in the Temple of this <HI>Nioma.</HI> Her greatest Festival is on the three and twentieth day of the third Moon; when the Priests repair from all Places of the Empire to her Tomb, because she knows (as they believe) when any Strangers shall address themselves to that Countrey, and whether their intentions be good or evil; nay more, will give certain Responses to any that consult her, in what affair soever; so that they are so perswaded and superstitious concerning her admonishments, that they think all is lost if she advise not thereunto. The original of her Adoration sprung hence (as the <HI>Chinese</HI> Records have it;) One <HI>Campo,</HI> a <HI>Chinese</HI> Admiral, going out with an Armado to Engage with a foreign Enemy, being driven by contrary Winds, was necessitated to anchor under the Lee of this Isle: but afterwards the Storm ceasing, and the Wind and Weather growing fair, the Fleet weighed, and hoi|sing Sail, set forward; but all the Sea-men with their conjoined strength could not get up his Anchor; which while they wondred at, this Goddess appear'd to the Admiral; whom imploring, she advis'd to take her aboard: for the Peo|ple against whom he had Commission to Fight were great Magitians, practi|sing the Black Art, and could raise or lay Spirits at their pleasure, but she was able to frustrate their diabolical practises. Thus perswaded, the Admiral with great reverence took her into his Ship, and coming to the Shore where they intended to Land, these Masters of occult Sciences us'd their skill as <HI>Nioma</HI> had foretold; but she baffled them in their own Arts, and so made their powerful|lest Charms of no effect: wherefore the King that trusted to his Necroman|cers, being necessitated to Engage with the <HI>Chineses,</HI> was by her direction and assistance, contrary to his confidence, utterly defeated and brought under sub|jection. The Admiral, though sensible of the wonderful Service which she had done by her power, desir'd that she would do something in his presence that he might relate, having so many eye-witnesses, to the Emperor. And having accidentally a wither'd Cane in his Hand, <HI>Nioma</HI> took it, and upon his Request immediately made it grow and blossom, and to yield a sweet smell: Which signal Prodigy the Admiral fix'd on his Stern, and coming to the Emperor, related to him all his Adventures: whereupon he in honor and commemoration of her favors, commanded that they should worship her as a Goddess through the whole Empire. Since which every Ship bears her Image in the Stern, and the Sea-men are strangely devoted to her.</P>

<PB N="43" REF="28">The fortieth God call'd <HI>Sikjaa,</HI> born in the Kingdom <HI>Tantaico,</HI> opposite to the West of <HI>China,</HI> they held for the first inventer of that Religion which the <HI>Chineses</HI> observe to this day. He always went bare headed, neither eating Flesh, Fish, or other Creature that had life&punc; and lived single. This <HI>Sikjaa</HI> Drawn or Carv'd to the life, stands upon the Altars in their Temples, and on the right-side at the entrance of the Door. Over against him, and in some Tem|ples round about him, stand long Tables; at which the Priests sit reading and muttering to themselves Prayers to <HI>Sikjaa,</HI> to receive them into Heaven. Two Priests watch day and night before his Altar, often bowing to the Ground, and lifting up their Heads equally together, whilst their Tabors and Pipes, consor|ted with other Wind-Instruments, makes no unpleasing harmony. In their Diet the Priests follow the strict Life of <HI>Sikjaa,</HI> eating nothing but Rice, Grapes and Herbs: they live some in the Wildernesses like Hermits; others frequent the Temples abroad, and spend their time for a small gratuity in making Offer|ings in peoples Houses, having no allowance either from the Emperor, or Charity of the People: They never pare their Nails, some of them growing six, eight, ten, and twelve Inches long, which the <HI>Chineses</HI> count a great Or|nament. The Doctrine of this <HI>Sikjaa</HI> is at large declared in the following Description of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>The one and fortieth God is call'd <HI>Ang-jaa,</HI> and is carried from House to House on the eleventh day of the third Moon on an Altar by six Priests, where|of three go before and three behind; before him stands a Perfuming-pot with burning Incense, and other Aromaticks. The Mendicant Priests stop at every House, and never leave Singing and Praying, tinckling two small Basons one against another, till the Master of the House comes and brings them some Mo|ney in a piece of Paper, as an Offering to this God.</P>
<P>This <HI>Ang-jaa</HI> is not Clothed like the other Gods, but quite naked, having onely a Cloth about his Middle, which reaches down to his Heels, and over his Shoulders a Scarf: his Hair, Beard, Mustacho's, and Face, differ much from the other <HI>Chinese Numens,</HI> the Hair of his Face more resembling an <HI>European</HI> than an <HI>Asiatick;</HI> concerning which dissimilitude the <HI>Chineses</HI> themselves are al|together silent.</P>
<P>The two and fortieth Deity call'd <HI>Tontekong,</HI> is represented in the shape of an antient Man with a white Beard, and said to be a great abhorrer of Gaming and Adultery, which by all means possible he sought to extinguish; wherefore the <HI>Chineses</HI> have placed him in Heaven, and also invoke him daily to defend them from Thieves.</P>
<P>The three and fortieth God, nam'd <HI>Teiton,</HI> a valiant Heroe, represented with a drawn Sword in his left-hand; whose Services in redeeming the Empire, like to be lost by the Invasion of the Enemy, have listed him in special rank amongst the number of their Gods.</P>
<P>The four and fortieth <HI>Schercong</HI> next takes place, adored for the invention of Tragedies and Comedies, and other Enterludes Acted on the Stage.</P>
<P>The five and fortieth God, nam'd <HI>Amkong,</HI> hath obtain'd the like honor meerly for his great Merits and Vertues.</P>
<P>The six and fortieth <HI>Tswajong,</HI> was in his life-time a mighty Man, of a Gi|gantick Stature: his Club, which he could flourish with one Hand, weighed ninety two pounds, so that for his strength and valour he was very famous in <HI>China,</HI> and therefore worshipp'd as a God.</P>
<P>The seven and fortieth <HI>Hangoe,</HI> another Giant, whose Helmet weighed one
<PB N="44" REF="29">
hundred twenty five pound, whose strength and valour made him living, a Vice-Roy, and after death, a Deity.</P>
<P>The eight and fortieth <HI>Hanzing,</HI> with whom none could stand in competiti|on either for Prudence or Science (except <HI>Quantecong</HI> and <HI>Sodejong</HI>) who per|form'd with a few Men greater Acts by his subtile Stratagems, and politick Conduct, than others with vast Armies, and therefore the <HI>Chineses</HI> worship and hold him for a God.</P>
<P>The nine and fortieth <HI>Sodejong,</HI> a wise and politick Prince, yet meek and loving to his Subjects, look'd upon as superior in his Character to <HI>Hanzing,</HI> but much inferior to <HI>Quantecong.</HI></P>
<P>The fiftieth <HI>Sjengoesoeng,</HI> also a very strong Giant, and much reputed for ser|ving his Countrey against the common Enemy.</P>
<P>The one and fiftieth <HI>Goumatzintzing,</HI> signifies <HI>Pastor Gregis, The Shepherd of the People, and a Servant to God.</HI> He had (if you will believe the <HI>Chineses</HI>) five Eyes, two in the right places, and two above them, and the fifth in the middle of his Forehead, like the Cinque upon a Dye; two of these were alway sawake, or open, whilst the other three were shut, for which they implore him as their Watch in Heaven.</P>
<P>The two and fiftieth <HI>Soumanoaom,</HI> had four Eyes, two in his Neck, and two in his Forehead: when those two in his Forehead closing slept, the other two kept open watchful; wherefore he being General, was never defeated, whom for his never-sleeping Care and Conduct they worship as a God.</P>
<P>The three and fiftieth <HI>Zjenzucung,</HI> a Lord of small Stature, wearing short Hair, but of an acute Wit and profound Understanding, and abominator of Gaming and Drink.</P>
<P>The four and fiftieth <HI>Quantecong,</HI> though by <HI>Iohannes Gonsales</HI> and others call'd <HI>Vitie;</HI> whom the <HI>Chineses</HI> honor'd more than any of their Gods, being reckon'd the first Emperor in <HI>China:</HI> for Valour, Subtilty, and Science, unpa|ralell'd, and not to be match'd: such was his wonderful and Gigantick Sta|ture, being as they fable, twelve Foot and eight Inches high, and his Shoulders four Foot broad; his Sword weighed ninety two pound, which he us'd with one Hand. In the beginning of his Reign he possessed onely one Province, but by his Conquests and Atchievements became Master of the fifteen which now make the Empire. He established many Laws and Ordinances, especial|ly one against Idleness. He first invented Clothing, and Dying of Stuffs, which they use to this day, for before they went naked like the <HI>Indians.</HI> He al|so modell'd and invented Ships, made Saw-Mills, Gun-powder, and Guns, and improved Architecture. Some Buildings and Edifices are yet to be seen, whereof, as they say, he was the Contriver. He made a Law, That all Me|chanicks should continue their Parents Trades from Generation to Genera|tion. He erected Cities, Towns, and Villages, and commanded the People to inhabit them. And as their Chronicles relate, this <HI>Quantecong</HI> with his own Hand slew in one Battle three thousand, some say four thousand Men. He had a <HI>Negro</HI> for his Squire, or Armor-bearer, who was no less valiant than himself, for he accompanied him in all dangers whatsoever, and was called <HI>Tzicutzong;</HI> he perform'd great Exploits in his Masters Service, by conquering many Peo|ple and several Countreys: but besides <HI>Quantecong</HI> had another Servant, a <HI>White,</HI> call'd <HI>Quanpiong,</HI> yet no Martialist.</P>
<P>This <HI>Quantecong</HI> is so highly esteem'd and honor'd amongst the <HI>Chineses,</HI> that most of them, except Sea&punc;men and Fishers, and they also make him weekly

Offerings, and burn every Night a Lamp with sweet and odoriserous Oyl be|fore him. Their Oblations consist in two pounds and a half of Hogs-flesh, three quarters of a pound of Deers-flesh, one boil'd Hen, nine Cakes of Meal-Flour, half a pint of a certain Liquor call'd <HI>Aoytziu,</HI> a Cup full of the Drink <HI>Lotchin,</HI> another full of <HI>Souchin</HI> and of the good Tope <HI>Samsoe,</HI> and lastly two Dishes of Rice; all which is set before the Image <HI>Quantecong,</HI> and stands three hours; after which time it is taken away again: both which are perform'd with great Ceremony, as bowing of Heads and Bodies; afterwards the Meat is eaten by the Offerers.</P>
<P>In every City is also a Temple erected to the honor of <HI>Quantecong,</HI> in which stands his Image: On one side of him stands his black Squire, with a Sword by his Side, and a large Knife, like a Mowers Scythe; four Paces from him on the other Side his white Page <HI>Quanpiong.</HI> Nor was he invocated onely by his Countrey-men, but also by the <HI>Tungkins</HI> their Enemies: for as soon as any War broke out, they set a Guard before his Temple that none might hurt him; for they believe he would punish their neglect with the loss of their Army. Nay farther they say, That mounting his red Horse <HI>Angbea</HI> (for he onely us'd a red Steed, there being none of that kind else in <HI>China</HI>) he Rid against their Enemies, and destroy'd their whole Army, in revenge of the damage done to his Temple.</P>
<P>The six and fiftieth <HI>Kongsou,</HI> is held for the first inventer of Printing, which the <HI>Chineses</HI> have us'd eight hundred years and upwards, insomuch that they say the <HI>Christians</HI> learn'd that art from them; because at that time they Traded with <HI>Christian</HI> Merchants.</P>
<P>This <HI>Kongsou</HI> stands on a Throne, environ'd with People of several Nations, every one holding a Book; of all which the <HI>Germans</HI> stand nearest to him, be|cause they (according to the testimony of the <HI>Chineses</HI>) have greater Judgment, and Print better than any other Nation.</P>
<P>The seven and fiftieth <HI>Tegoe,</HI> that is, <HI>Transitory Bull.</HI></P>
<P>The eight and fiftieth they nominate <HI>Kjenke,</HI> that is, <HI>Crow,</HI> or <HI>Chicken-Thief.</HI> A strange fancy and belief possesses the <HI>Chineses</HI> about these their two Deities: for, say they, when <HI>Tegoe</HI> hath the Earth on his Shoulders, then <HI>Kjenke</HI> comes from Heaven and pecks <HI>Tegoe</HI> on his Body; whereby necessitated to shake him|self, the Earth trembles and shakes with him: and as soon as any such trepi|dation begins, they fall a laughing, saying, <HI>Now is</HI> Tegoe <HI>peck'd by</HI> Kjenke.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Martinius,</HI> in his <HI>Chinese</HI> History saith, That the Soil of <HI>China</HI> is very<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 9. pag. 389.</NOTE> little subject to Earthquakes: yet the Chronicles of that Countrey mention, That the Year before the Birth of our Saviour 73. hapned such a great Earth|quake, that several Mountains were swallow'd up: from whence the <HI>Chineses,</HI> a People much inclin'd to Superstition, prognosticated the destruction of their Empire, such things, say they, proceeding from an angry and threatning Heaven.</P>
<P>The nine and fiftieth <HI>Luikong,</HI> or <HI>The God of Thunder,</HI> for <HI>Lui</HI> is Thunder, and <HI>Kong</HI> a Governor. They represent him with a Head like a Crane, Feet and Hands like an Eagles Claws, and large Wings, wherewith he seems to flye through the Clouds. When this <HI>Luikong</HI> (say they) intends to Thunder, he stands between four Clouds, with a Drum on every one, on which he beats continually with two great Iron Pestles: And when any one is struck by a Thunder-bolt, they say that <HI>Luikong</HI> is much enraged against that Person, and therefore struck him with the foremention'd Pestles: so that they are very
<PB N="46" REF="31">
fearful of him, and when it Thunders creep on their Hands and Feet under Benches and Tables.</P>
<P>The sixtieth is the Ruler of Lightning, and represented by the <HI>Chineses</HI> with a Straw Wisp in her Hand, which when it Lightens she spreads abroad.</P>
<P>The sixty first <HI>Kieugkong,</HI> the God of Rainbows: the <HI>Chineses</HI> nick-name him <HI>Omho,</HI> that is, <HI>Mischievous,</HI> because at his appearance he spoils all their Fruits of the Field; so that they honor him onely because he should come but seldom.</P>
<P>The sixty second <HI>Pankun,</HI> according to the Chronicles of <HI>China,</HI> finished and compleated the World; for they say that the World when God Created it was without shape or form, but was by <HI>Pankun</HI> brought to its full perfection in four years time. They represent him with many Iron Instruments, such as the Stone-cutters use. He was the first that invented the Art of Stone-cutting, and therefore is the peculiar God of Bricklayers, Stone-cutters, and Potters.</P>
<P>The sixty third <HI>Houngkong,</HI> rules Winds and Spirits, and is figur'd like a great Bird with huge long Legs and Feathers, sticking up like Hogs Bristles. The <HI>Chineses</HI> say, that the fluttering of his Wings occasion great Winds, Storms and Tempests: therefore Fishers, Sea-men, Gardners, and other People that fear too much Wind, adore him.</P>
<P>The sixty fourth <HI>Khuotquan,</HI> in his life-time was a Vice-Roy in <HI>China,</HI> and the first that made Salt, which he accounted the richest and best Commo|dity in the World. Another Vice-Roy having at the same time found out Sugar, esteem'd that above Salt: upon this they fell at variance; but both sides appealing to the Emperor, he commanded a Proof to be brought him of each sort, and having tasted both, he preferred the Sugar, as being more plea|sant. But <HI>Khuotquan</HI> contradicted this sentence, saying, That there never was a thing of greater value than Salt, which gave a rellish and savoury taste to all things. The Emperor angry at <HI>Khuotquans</HI> petulancy, commanded him to go out of his Presence: who thereupon much discontented, went instantly and drown'd himself in the River <HI>Melo,</HI> which flows by the City <HI>Siangin,</HI> in the Territory of <HI>Huquang;</HI> but highly advanced him that made the Sugar. The next day (saith <HI>Wright</HI>) after which <HI>Khuotquan</HI> was drown'd, being the fifth Day of the fifth Moon, in the Morning (as the <HI>Chinese</HI> Chronicles affirm) there began an extraordinary great Rain, which without cessation continu'd twelve Moneths, wherefore for want of dry Weather no Salt could be made, by which means a third part of the People died, and some that lay just upon the point of Death, having but one Corn of Salt put into their Mouths presently reco|ver'd: The Emperor inform'd of this Calamity by his Substitute Governors, commanded him that had made the Sugar to be kill'd, and that none should dare to make any more mention of him, that thereby his Name might be for|gotten: whereupon the Rain immediately ceasing, the Emperor sent strict Edicts through all his Dominions, that they should worship the foremention'd <HI>Khuotquan</HI> as a God. On the day of his decease, which is kept with great so|lemnity, and call'd <HI>Tuonu,</HI> the Houses are hung round with Garlands of Roses, Palm-Boughs, and the Ships adorn'd in like manner; and every <HI>Chinese</HI> wears a green Sprig on his Head: neither do they any Work in five days, all which time they hold his Festival. The second day they represent <HI>Wayangs,</HI> or Stage-plays. On the third they go with hundreds of curious Gilt and Carv'd Boats, hung with all manner of green Boughs, Flowers and the like, and full of People up and down the River, seeming to look for the Corps of <HI>Khuotquan;</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="31">
coming to the Place where they say they find <HI>Khuotquan,</HI> they lift up their Oars, and take hold of their Flags and Pendants, and then beating on their Drums, cry with a loud voice, <HI>We have found him.</HI> This Ceremony, which is observ'd in all Places and Rivers in <HI>China,</HI> continues three days one after another.</P>
<P>This <HI>Khuotquan</HI> died about three thousand years since, and being taken up two days after his Decease, was kept ten years Embalm'd before he was Buried.</P>
<P>The sixty fifth <HI>Schante,</HI> was in his life-time a valiant Man, and a great pitier of the Poor, to whom he was very charitable.</P>
<P>The sixty sixth <HI>Naon,</HI> was an Assistant to the God <HI>Tegoe</HI> before mention'd: he is represented with a Ball on his Foot; for (as they fable) when <HI>Tegoe</HI> grow|eth weary with carrying so great a burthen as the World, then this <HI>Naon</HI> helps him to support it with his Foot: wherefore they place this <HI>Naon</HI> in Heaven, and worship him, because when displeas'd he should not let the World fall by taking away his Foot.</P>
<P>The sixty seventh <HI>Atzion,</HI> was Conceiv'd after a strange manner by his Mo|ther <HI>Lintion,</HI> who walking in the Field, and casting her Eyes up toward Heaven, espi'd a Lions Head in the Clouds; by which Vision she Conceiv'd with this <HI>Atzion,</HI> without knowing Man: for which his wonderful Conception he is by the <HI>Chineses</HI> honor'd for a God.</P>
<P>The sixty eighth <HI>Alsa,</HI> taught the People first to Boil and Roast their Meat: for before his time the <HI>Chineses</HI> did eat both Flesh and Fish raw. He instructed them also to build Huts of Wood for a defence against wild Beasts; and to make Clothes to cover their nakedness.</P>
<P>The sixty ninth <HI>Huntzuihoykong,</HI> they say first invented Fire, and taught them to Buy and to Sell.</P>
<P>The seventieth <HI>Otzoe,</HI> was Conceiv'd after as strange a manner as the be|fore-mention'd <HI>Atzion;</HI> for his Mother <HI>Hautzibon</HI> going to the Garden for an Onion, she saw some Foot-steps of a Man that had been there before her, in one of which she put hers, to try how much bigger it was than her own; which she had no sooner done, but a great Light encompassing her, she imme|diately Conceiv'd this <HI>Otzoe,</HI> who was the first that established Matrimony amongst the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and invented Musical Instruments.</P>
<P>The seventy first <HI>Ezolon,</HI> the first Finder of Medicines and the Vertue of Herbs; had great knowledge in Astronomy, Soothsaying, and Magick; in|structed Men in Agriculture by the use of the Plough and Spade, and all sorts of Ploughing Tools.</P>
<P>The seventy second <HI>Skadingkon,</HI> was the first, as they say, that taught them the use of Arms, and Martial Discipline.</P>
<P>Besides these five Governors of Heaven, three Spirits, eight and twenty Councellors, and thirty six earthly Deities, in all seventy two, the <HI>Chineses,</HI> ac|cording to the foremention'd <HI>Wright,</HI> have three <HI>Cacadaemons,</HI> or evil Spirits.</P>
<P>The first is call'd <HI>Tytsoequi,</HI> that is, <HI>Prince of Devils,</HI> for <HI>Tytsoe</HI> signifies <HI>Prince,</HI> and <HI>Qui</HI> the <HI>Devil:</HI> and as their Stories would make out, he was first an Angel in Heaven, but the supream God observing the wickedness of Mankind on Earth, he call'd <HI>Tytsoequi</HI> to him, saying, <HI>I have seen the wickedness of Men on Earth, and their hearts are inclin'd to evil; wherefore none of them shall come to me in Heaven: Therefore do you descend; I have prepared a Place for you, and an everlasting Prison of torments for them. I elect you as our Substitute to Govern Hell; take them to you and punish them; they shall stay with you for ever, and never come near me.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> are of opinion, and believe, that this Prince of Devils knows all future things, and that he sends out his Spirits to fetch vitious People to Hell, where he torments them for ever; therefore they worship him that they may not be tortured.</P>
<P>They also firmly believe, That the Souls of the Wicked return again on Earth to plague and terrifie those alive, which, they say, appear to them in se|veral Visions.</P>
<P>On the fifteenth day of the seventh Moon they present him a well drest Swine whole, and likewise Hens, Ducks, <HI>Pinang,</HI> and Cakes of fine Meal, <HI>Keekieuw,</HI> that is, <HI>Arak,</HI> or Brandy, and Sugar-Canes. The Hog they lay down on his two foremost Knees, with his Head on his fore-Feet opposite to the Image <HI>Tytsoequi;</HI> and use afterwards so many extraordinary Ceremonies at this Offering, that beginning early in the Morning, it continues above an hour after Sun-set.</P>
<P>Several Gilded pieces of Paper, made like a Boat are also burnt in honor to him; and they are very zealous in their Prayers to this <HI>Tytsoequi.</HI></P>
<P>In Hell, they say, he is served like a King, having two Councellors and twelve Spirits, which wear mighty Knives, and wait upon him continually like Halberdeers, to receive and execute his Commands; besides several other Spirits which serve him as Gentlemen.</P>
<P>The second, or Vice-Roy of Hell, they call <HI>Iamkoen,</HI> who Commands with great Authority, wherefore they worship and fear him.</P>
<P>The third <HI>Iamtouwi.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> also observe a certain day in the Year, on which they Offer to all the happy departed Souls, calling it <HI>Chinkbinch,</HI> and is kept Annually on the third day of the third Moon the Year after Leap-year, but in the Year be|fore Leap-year on the twentieth day of the same Moon. Thus far <HI>David Wright.</HI></P>
<P>In Valour and Warlike Policy the <HI>Chineses</HI> of <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa</HI> far exceed
<PB N="49" REF="32">
those on the Main Land, most of them at all times wearing Skeans by their sides, except when at Meat in their own Houses.</P>
<P>They use no Knives, Forks, or Spoons to eat withall, but take it up with two small Sticks made of Ivory or Ebony-Wood, Tipt at the ends with Sil|ver or Gold.</P>
<P>Women of mean Capacity maintain themselves with Spinning and Twist|ing of raw Silk, which is brought thither from the Territory of <HI>Chickinny.</HI></P>
<P>The Women eat not constantly with their Husbands at Meals; and when heretofore the Men found no Women according to their minds on the Islands, they sent for them out of <HI>China,</HI> and barter'd for them as other Commodities.</P>
<P>Lastly, it is requisite in this place to give a short account how <HI>Coxinga</HI> and his Associates, <HI>Anno</HI> 1661. took both these Islands from the <HI>Netherland East-India</HI> Company; but first we will shew his Extract, strange Rise, with the Ruine of his Father, who was call'd <HI>Chunchilung,</HI> and by Foreigners <HI>Iquon,</HI> or <HI>Ikoan</HI> and <HI>Equan:</HI> a Man of mean Descent, born in a small Village on the Sea|shore, in the Territory <HI>Fokien,</HI> near the City <HI>Annay,</HI> his Father very poor, and as some say, a Taylor by Trade: He first Serv'd the <HI>Portuguese</HI> in the City <HI>Makao,</HI> and afterwards the <HI>Hollanders</HI> on the Island <HI>Formosa;</HI> where soon after he be|came a great Merchant by the <HI>Iapan</HI> Trade, and at last a Pyrate. Having from this small beginning gotten a great Fleet of Ships, and obtain'd by his po|litick Designs and grand Undertakings, to so great Treasure, that the <HI>Chi|nese</HI> Emperor was not able to stand in competition with him; for he onely of all the <HI>Chineses</HI> ingrossed the Commodities of all <HI>India</HI> in his own hands, driving therewith a vast Trade with the <HI>Portuguese</HI> at <HI>Makao;</HI> with the <HI>Spaniards</HI> on the <HI>Philippine</HI> Islands; and with the <HI>Hollanders</HI> at <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Batavia;</HI> and likewise with the <HI>Iapanners;</HI> besides other Oriental Kingdoms and Islands. He onely Transported the <HI>Chinese</HI> Commodities by his own People, bringing back the <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>European</HI> in Returns for them; so that he began to grow so exceeding|ly rich, that he could fit out a Fleet of three thousand Sail.</P>
<P>Yet this <HI>Chinchilung,</HI> or <HI>Iquon,</HI> not contenting himself herewith, began to Plot how to be Emperor of <HI>China;</HI> but well knowing that he could never effect it, so long as any of the Imperial <HI>Tamingian</HI> Family was in being, which at that time held the Royal Seat, therefore he made choice of a time to extirpate that Family, which was <HI>Anno</HI> 1644. when the <HI>Tartars</HI> over-ran the whole Empire, except three Provinces, being <HI>Folnien,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Chincheo, Quantung,</HI> and <HI>Quangsi;</HI> and the more closely to hide his Design, he pretended to take up Arms against the <HI>Tartars,</HI> as Enemies to the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and defend that Empire with all his Forces. And without doubt under this Disguise he would have been taken for the Redeemer and Protector of that Crown, had he not held Correspondence with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> to whom he gave what Intelligence he thought good for his advantage. At the same time when the <HI>Tartars</HI> fell into the Countrey of <HI>Fokien, Iquon</HI> was declar'd General by the Emperor <HI>Lungun,</HI> of all his Forces; the Officers also were either his Brothers or Friends, so that being able to do what he listed, he permitted the <HI>Tartars</HI> to come into the Em|pire; for which they gave him the Title of <HI>King,</HI> making him King of <HI>Pingnan,</HI> which is in the Southern part of <HI>China,</HI> and sent him many great Gifts, the more easily to delude him: and though perhaps not ignorant of his De|sign, but fearing his formidable Power, they durst not use any rigorous course against him, but rather Treated him very honorably with Presents, high En|tertainments, and large Promises of the Government over the Territories of
<PB N="50" REF="33">
<HI>Fokien</HI> and <HI>Quantung;</HI> so that he thought easily to get an absolute Command over the Southern Countreys. But when the <HI>Tartar</HI> intended to return to the Imperial City <HI>Peking,</HI> and all his Vice-Roys according to custom came to attend and accompany him some part of the Way; <HI>Iquon</HI> also not suspecting any danger, came to shew his Respects in like manner, and went with a few, having left his Fleet in the Haven before the City of <HI>Focheu:</HI> but now being ready to depart, having perform'd his Complements, and desiring leave to re|turn, the <HI>Tartar</HI> Prince requested him to go with him to <HI>Peking</HI> to the Empe|ror, where he promised him the highest Preferments: and although <HI>Iquon</HI> sought with many Arguments to put off this Journey; yet was he at last for|ced to go; so that by this Stratagem he was taken, which could not be by force of Arms, or any Device whatsoever. Coming to <HI>Peking</HI> he was put close Prisoner, not onely under a strict Guard, but the Door of the Place wherein he was kept, made up with Stone, and himself loaded with Fetters about his Neck and Feet; and if any new Troubles hapned by his Son <HI>Coxinga,</HI> and the News thereof brought to the Court at <HI>Peking,</HI> as it did <HI>Anno</HI> 1657. (at which time the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were there in an Embassy) they laid fifteen Chains more upon him. His Son <HI>Coxinga</HI> and Brothers inform'd of his Imprisonment, be|took themselves again to the Fleet, and made all the Seas near <HI>China</HI> by their Pyracies almost useless.</P>
<P>Upon this account <HI>Coxinga</HI> with his Associates, and a crew of Rebel <HI>Chine|ses,</HI> kept the <HI>Tartars</HI> on the Coast of <HI>China</HI> in continual Alarms, and had his chiefest Residence on the Islands <HI>Ay, Quemuy,</HI> and others lying under the Conti|nent of <HI>China.</HI> The <HI>Chineses</HI> themselves on the Main Coast, who had submitted, and in token thereof shav'd off their Hair, conform'd to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> brought them all sorts of Provisions, and drove also a private Trade with them. The <HI>Tartars</HI> at last, to stop all Provisions from going to the Enemy, commanded all the Villages, Towns and Hamlets that stood along the Sea-shore, or the Main Continent, to be burnt to the Ground, and the Countrey laid waste, and no People suffer'd on pain of death to live within three Leagues of the Sea. By this means, and likewise by the great Losses which <HI>Coxinga</HI> sustain|ed from the <HI>Tartars,</HI> assisted by the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> who set upon them both at Sea and Land, he found himself so straightned, that <HI>Anno</HI> 1660. he Sail'd with all his Forces to <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa,</HI> both which Islands, and also the Castle <HI>Ze|landia;</HI> he took in <HI>March, Anno</HI> 1661. after a Siege of ten Moneths. Very cruelly were several of the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> dealt withall, especially the Ministers <HI>Anthony Hantbroel, Aren Vincenius, Leonard Campen, Peter Muts</HI> and others, and at last put to death: others against Agreement kept in Prison, without hopes of attaining their Liberty, notwithstanding the great trouble the <HI>Hollanders</HI> took upon them to procure their enlargement. Therefore in revenge of <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Cruelties, and also to regain the conquer'd Places, a Fleet was sent out the next year af|ter, under the Command of the afore-mention'd Admiral <HI>Balthazar Bort,</HI> and Vice-Admiral <HI>Iohn van Campen,</HI> with the Ambassador <HI>Constantine Nobel,</HI> with Letters from his Excellency <HI>Iohn Maetzuiker,</HI> to <HI>Singlamong,</HI> Vice-Roy of the Ter|ritory <HI>Fokien,</HI> and the General <HI>Taisang Lipoui</HI> for the same purpose, and also to request liberty for a free Trade.</P>
<P>Since the Letter to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> in brief contains the Reasons and Intentions for sending out the Fleet to the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> and the dispatching of an Ambassador thither, and may also serve for a small declaration of our fol|lowing Discourse, I judge it no way amiss to set it down before-hand, being to this effect:</P>

<OPENER>This Letter comes from <HI>John Maetzuiker,</HI> chief Governor, and the Councel for the <HI>Ne|therland</HI> State in the Countreys of <HI>India,</HI> to <HI>Singlamong,</HI> Vice-Roy, or Governor for the Mighty Emperor of <HI>Tartary</HI> and <HI>China:</HI> of the Territory <HI>Fokien,</HI> whom the God of Heaven grant long Life, and Prosperity on Earth.<SALUTE>Great and Powerful Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe Letter sent some time since from Your Highness to our Governor of <HI>Tayowan</HI> he hath receiv'd in due time, and also not been negligent to Answer according to Request, and with all speed sent five Men of War with some Soldiers, to the Bay of <HI>Engeling,</HI> that according to Your Highness's noble Proposal and Request they might, bidding defiance to <HI>Coxinga,</HI> fall upon him. But We were so unhappy, that as soon as the Ships set Sail from <HI>Tayowan,</HI> they were surpris'd by a mighty Storm, which separated them one from another, so that some of them came back to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and others were forc'd to return again to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> which is the onely Reason that We could not perform Our good Intentions according to Your Highness's Pleasure. Since which time <HI>Coxinga</HI> hath joyn'd all his Forces together to Master our Castle in <HI>Tayowan,</HI> having Besieged it ten Moneths, rais'd great Batteries against it on all sides, and so straitned the Besieged with his Army, that the Governor and his Councel concluded to deliver him the Fort; which We have resented very ill of our People, because, as We suppose, they have not as they ought to have done, manfully resisted the Enemy; which as an Example to terri|fie others, We will not pass by unpunished. Yet since We have suffer'd so great a Loss and Damage, and chiefly for that against his Promise he hath most cruelly Murder'd several Unarmed <HI>Christians</HI> on the Island <HI>Formosa;</HI> God who is a hater of such Villanies, and a righteous Judge, commands Us to take Revenge for our sustained Wrongs; so that we are resolv'd with all our Forces to prosecute this Tyrant, and not leave, till by force of Arms We have brought him to nought. And since we are inform'd, that Your High|ness also intends and endeavors the like Ruine towards him; so at once to free the Empire of <HI>China</HI> from the Oppression which it hath suffer'd so many years by his Means: Therefore We think it now the most proper time to obtain as well Your Highness's, as our own Desires: to which end, accord|ing to Your Highness's own Proposal, We are inclin'd to joyn all Our Land and Sea-Forces with Your Highness's Militia, against which We suppose <HI>Coxinga</HI> will not be able to subsist long. And to shew that We really intend it, We have sent from hence under the Command of Our Admiral <HI>Balthazar Bort</HI> to the Bay of <HI>Hossien,</HI> the number of twelve well prepar'd Men of War, which, considering their strength and fit posture for defence, may justly be term'd <HI>Floating Castles,</HI> and will be able to make <HI>Coxinga</HI> quit the Sea, which will not a little trouble and disable him: of which We hope Your High|ness shall in a short time see the Event. We therefore fortifie Our selves, (hoping that Your Highness will do the like) that We may enter into a firm League with the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> with Promises faithfully to assist one ano|ther against <HI>Coxinga,</HI> and to hold him for our mortal Enemy, and with all Endeavors, if it be possible, bring him and all his Party to utter Ruine, so to make him taste the sharpness of Our Revenge for his committed Villa|nies. But since at present, having lost <HI>Tayowan,</HI> We have no convenient Har|bors to preserve Our Ships in stormy Weather, Our humble Request is, That
<PB N="52" REF="34">
your Highness would please to do us that favor, as far as your Commands reach along the Sea-Coasts, to Permit and Order us a place wherein our Ships, if they should chance to be necessitated, may come to an Anchor, and that they may be kindly receiv'd, and our People entertain'd as Friends, and buy Provisions and other Necessaries for Money.</P>
<P><HI>China</HI> and <HI>Batavia</HI> (as your Highness very well knows) lie a great distance one from another, therefore it is very necessary and requisite, that we had a convenient place of Rendezvouz near <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Channel, there to keep our Ships together, and watch for his Jonks; so that we desire of your High|ness, that you would be pleas'd to direct us to such a place, and to give us leave likewise to Fortifie the same against <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Assaults; for we do as|sure your Highness, if this cannot be granted us, it is altogether impossible for us to do the Enemy that damage which may be expected: Therefore if we intend to manage this War with Prudence, we must be there to wait on our business continually, or else we shall not be able to clear the Sea of <HI>Cox|inga</HI>'s Ships.</P>
<P>And as the driving of Trade makes all Nations and People flourish, and we are us'd from Antiquity to promote the same, for the benefit of the pub|lique good, we thought fit to make our inclination known to your High|ness, that we heartily desire to furnish the Emperor of <HI>China</HI> with our Com|modities, which formerly the same <HI>Coxinga</HI> hath prevented by his wicked Practices; therefore to perfect all our good Undertakings, we desire that we may be permitted to come into the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> and have Passes from the great <HI>Cham,</HI> which we intreat your Highness to procure for us, not doubt|ing, but they may easily be attain'd; because when two years ago the Em|peror was Complemented by two of our Ambassadors with Presents, he in part promis'd it to us; which your Highness having at that time the Com|mand over <HI>Canton,</HI> and conversing much with our People, may perhaps re|member.</P>
<P>We send to your Highness with this Letter our peculiar Friend Captain <HI>Constantine Nobell,</HI> humbly to Complement your Honor; and at large de|clare our Intentions, with Request, that your Highness would favorably be pleas'd to hear him, and speedily to dispatch him: We also promise, that whatever your Highness agrees with him about, we will approve of, and stand ingaged to: And for a Present, we here send to your Highness these un|der-written Commodities, desiring your Highness to accept them in good Friendship.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The Letter to the General <HI>Taisang Lipovi,</HI> was writ almost after the same manner, with the same Requests and Promises; <HI>viz.</HI> A League with the Em|pire of <HI>China,</HI> to help to ruine <HI>Coxinga,</HI> upon condition, that the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> should be free to enter any Haven, and take possession of a convenient place on the Coast of <HI>China;</HI> as may be seen in the same Letter in its proper place, where it is set down <HI>Verbatim.</HI> Hereupon the Grand Commissioners at <HI>Batavia,</HI> the General <HI>Iohn Maetzuiker,</HI> and the <HI>Indian</HI> Council began to prepare and make ready several stout Men of War, storing with plenty of Ammunition, and Provisions, and Manning them also with Soldiers and Sea-men.</P>

hundred twenty eight Sea-men, and seven hundred fifty six Soldiers; in the whole, one thousand two hundred eighty four Men: With these twelve Ships of War, three Merchants, being the <HI>Leerdam, Singing-Bird,</HI> and <HI>Loosduinen,</HI> set Sail, richly Laden for <HI>Iapan,</HI> under the Command of Captain and Admiral <HI>Henry Van Indiik,</HI> having Command to keep company with the Fleet, so long as they did not go out from their Coast.</P>
<P>The day on which they were to set Sail, the Admiral <HI>Bort,</HI> and Council of<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fleet divided into three Squadrons.</NOTE> War, for certain reasons, divided the Fleet into three Squadrons, and every Squadron under one chief Commander, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Zierikzee, Meliskerken, Hoge|lande, Ter Boede,</HI> with the Fly-Boat <HI>Leerdam,</HI> under the Command of the Vice-Admiral <HI>Campen.</HI> The <HI>Naerden, Overveen, Sea-Dog,</HI> and <HI>Vink,</HI> with the <HI>Singing-Bird</HI> Pink, under Captain <HI>Balthazar Bort&punc;</HI> The <HI>Domburgh, Ankeveen, Breukelen, Loenen,</HI> with the Pink <HI>Loosduinen,</HI> Commanded by <HI>Constantine Nobel.</HI></P>

<P>All these Isles, though desolate and uninhabited, are Planted along the Shores, and up into the In-land, with several sorts of excellent Trees, which make a pleasant Prospect off at Sea, and stand in such order, as they had been the Workmanship of Art, and not the meer Dress of Nature.</P>
<P>And likewise the Vallies, Plains and Hills upon them afford, divers sorts of Flowers, Herbs, and Drugs.</P>

<P>The Trees are loaden with all manner of Singing-Birds, whose Harmonies are so pleasing, that the Inhabitants of <HI>Batavia</HI> often go to this Island in Boats, to recreate themselves with their Musick, as we to our Wood sides, to hear the Thrush and Nightingale.</P>
<P>On the same day, the Council concluded to Sail first to the Islands <HI>Laver</HI> and <HI>Timon,</HI> lying in their way close by one another, that there they might supply themselves with fresh Water, all sorts of Provisions and Fuel, Anchor|stocks, Hand-spikes, and other Materials of Wood, which that place yields in abundance.</P>

<P>Therefore all the Captains of Ships are expresly Commanded, continually to observe his motion, that when he Anchors, Sails, or Tacks, they do the like, so the better to keep the Fleet together, and prevent separation.</P>
<P>None shall offer in the Nght to Sail by the same Vessel, much less alter his course on forfeiture of four Rix-Dollars for the Master, chief, or Under-Mates, in whose Watch soever this misdemeanor shall happen.</P>
<P>If the Pilot thinks it fit to Tack in the Night, either for the Winds shrink|ing, or otherwise, he shall put Candles into two Lanthorns on his Poop, and all the other Ships one, that thereby it may be known, whether they see the Sign or not.</P>
<P>In the Night, the altering of the Course shall be left to the discretion of him that carrys the Lanthorn.</P>
<P>When they have Sea-room enough, they shall not Tack, for the Winds shrinking of one or two Points, for the prevention of all dangers, and keeping together.</P>
<P>If he that carries the Light, thinks fit to Anchor in the Night, he shall set two Lights, one over another on his Stern, which sign being seen, the other Ships shall instantly come to an Anchor, and likewise set a Candle on their Sterns.</P>
<P>When it is thought fit to set Sail again, he shall fire a Gun, and make a sig|nal by another Light from the Poop; which the other Ships seeing, shall also put out a Light, and then Weigh Anchor.</P>
<P>If it should happen that any Ship or Ships should by accident either prove leaky, run a-ground, strike upon a Rock, Land, or ought else, he shall unfurle a Pennon from his Fore-Mast, and fire a Gun; whereupon, every one shall be oblig'd to come with his Boat and Pinnace, and assist the Vessel according to the utmost of their power, on forfeiture, as in the Council it shall be judg'd fit.</P>
<P>If an accident shall happen by fire, they shall discharge two or three Guns presently one after another, that with Buckets and Pails the rest may come and help the Ship in distress.</P>
<P>And that the Ships in dark or misty Weather may not straying loose each other, they shall sometimes speak to one another with their Guns, and as often reply. If the Lanthorn Ship judges it fitting to Tack, he shall fire a great Gun, which the rest hearing, shall answer him, and Tack to|gether.</P>
<P>If in a dark Night they are forc'd by stress of Weather, or an overgrown Sea to lie at Hull, or carry no Sail, the guide shall set forth two Light<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of one

<P>In a calm, with a rowling Sea, they shall take great care that the Ships do not fall foul one upon another, by endeavoring to keep as far distant as they can.</P>
<P>When it grows light, and they from Sea descry Land, Sounding for Ground, they shall unfurle the Princes Flag or Colours, and also fire a Gun; if in the Night they chance to discern Land, or Fathom Ground, he shall light two Can|dles by one another, and fire two Guns.</P>
<P>If any Ships stray from the Fleet, and afterwards appear in sight, they shall hoiss up their fore-Sail three times, and then let it down again; then fire a great Gun, and draw back the fore-Sail, till probably the rest have seen it, and also furle up his Sprit-Sail and Mizzen; after which signs he may come again to his company.</P>
<P>If this should happen in the Night, they shall call to one another, by the word, <HI>Holla, Ship,</HI> if it be one of our Fleet, he shall answer, <HI>Victoria,</HI> which if he does not do, it is a certain sign that it is a strange Ship, and either a <HI>Chi|nesy</HI> Jonk or Vessel; and if it be possible, give notice of it to the Admiral, Vice- or Rear-Admiral, who ever of them be nearest, however, to keep within shot; and if it be an Enemy, to give notice to the rest, by the firing of Guns.</P>
<P>He that descrys any strange Ships, or Jonks by day, shall let his Colours flie from his Stern, and <HI>Veare</HI> his fore-<HI>Shete,</HI> and soon after hale it up; if by night, he shall light two Candles together, without making chase after it, before he hath spoke, and receiv'd order from the Admiral, except it be a <HI>Portuguese,</HI> or <HI>Chinesy</HI> Vessel, which by that means might make his escape.</P>
<P>In this exigent, though the Enemy be never so powerful, let him fall on, and if he can possible make himself master thereof; afterwards to do accord|ing to the Orders given in Martial Affairs.</P>
<P>If any Frigats should be separated from the Fleet, either by Storm or other accidents, they shall according to an express Order from his Excellency the Lord General, and Lords of the <HI>Indian</HI> Council, come to the place of Meet|ing or Rendezvouz chosen by them, being <HI>Isla de Lemas,</HI> one of the most Eastern Islands of <HI>Makao,</HI> which lies in the way of our Voyage, and we may touch at without prejudice or loss of time; and also because his Excellency hath receiv'd information, that there is not onely a good Haven, but fresh Water; so that the separated Ships are strictly Commanded, not to pass by the foremention'd Island <HI>De Lemas,</HI> but put in to it, and there wait for the Fleets coming, that so they may proceed on together in their Voyage, and the more resolutely bid the Enemy defiance, if they should Rancounter.</P>

<P>On Thursday morning, being the twenty seventh, the Fleet having the same Weather, found themselves to be in four Degrees and eighteen Mi|nutes South-Latitude; and in the afternoon, beyond the Point of <HI>Boomy's Riff,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Boomyes</HI> Riff.</NOTE> in nine and ten Fathom Gravelly Ground; in the Night, on fourteen and fif|teen Fathom, the same Ground, they spy'd the Banks of the foresaid <HI>Riff</HI> at a pretty distance.</P>
<P>On Wednesday Morning the twenty eighth, the Fleet (being in thirteen and fourteen Fathom Water, the Wind Easterly) saw the Island <HI>Lucipar,</HI> or <HI>Lu|kapar,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Island <HI>Lukapar&punc;</HI></NOTE> lying to the South-West, about a League and a half from them. This Island lies near <HI>Sumatra,</HI> in the Mouth of the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Banka,</HI> and is fourteen Leagues in Circumference. It is uninhabited, yet Wooddy, and yields a plea|sant Prospect with its high Trees towards the Sea; it is interlac'd with many murmuring Streams, which abounding in Fish, and the Woods with Beasts, makes it a fit place for the Sea-men to refresh in.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, being in three Degrees, and seven Minutes, <HI>Lukapar</HI> lay three Leagues South South-East from the Fleet; and having got the first Point of <HI>Sumatra</HI> on their Starboard, their Course being North-East and by East, they Sail'd along the Coast of <HI>Sumatra</HI> in ten and thirteen Fathom Water.</P>
<P>The twenty ninth about Noon, the Fleet Sail'd by <HI>Poele Nancha,</HI> lying in the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Banka,</HI> thirty Leagues to the In-land, in two Degrees and twenty five Minutes Southern-Latitude, and were got within a small League from the third Point of <HI>Sumatra.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="37"><HI>Poele Nancha,</HI> that is, <HI>The Isle Nancha,</HI> (for <HI>Poele</HI> is Island, and <HI>Nancha</HI> the pro|per name of the place) and signifies <HI>Round Island,</HI> so call'd, being indeed al|most Circular, and hath eight Leagues in Circumference, very barren, being onely Sandy Ground, having on the Shore nothing but a few Turtles.</P>
<P>In the Evening, about Sun-set, they came up with the high Promontary <HI>Monapien,</HI> on the North of the Island <HI>Banka;</HI> and the Fore-Land of <HI>Sumatra</HI> ly|ing West South-West, about a League from them.</P>
<P><HI>Banka,</HI> an Island about a League from <HI>Sumatra,</HI> is inhabited, fruitful, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Island <HI>Banka.</HI></NOTE> full of Woods.</P>
<P>The thirteenth, being Friday, the Fleet was at Noon gotten into one De|gree and twenty two Minutes South-Latitude; and had <HI>Poele Toutyon,</HI> that is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Poele Toutyon.</NOTE> seven Islands, East and by North, four Leagues from them in sixteen and seven|teen Fathom Water. These Isles, though they lie close by one another, yet are uninhabited.</P>
<P>Close by <HI>Poele Toutyon,</HI> towards the East, lies the Isle of <HI>Linge,</HI> Inhabited on<NOTE PLACE="marg">Island <HI>Linge.</HI></NOTE> the Shore by Fishers and Rusticks; but in the Countrey by a People who came thither from the Mountain <HI>Passarvan,</HI> which is in <HI>Iova;</HI> for these People opprest by the King of <HI>Passarvan,</HI> with great Tributes and other Inconvenien|cies, fled for their better accommodation to several places; most of them being Licens'd by the King of <HI>Bantam</HI> to have setled behind the City, on the Coast of <HI>Sunda,</HI> at the foot of the Mountain <HI>Gomon Bezar,</HI> where they have built the Ci|ty <HI>Sura,</HI> and several Villages, Electing a King of their own, which pays Tri|bute to the King of <HI>Bantam.</HI> Others have setled themselves on this Isle, and built Towns and Villages, which they enjoy'd in Peace a long time, but sub|mitted themselves at last, either out of kindness, or force, to the King of <HI>Sura.</HI></P>
<P>These People live peaceably and friendly, maintaining themselves with Husbandry or Tillage; and observe the old <HI>Pythagorean</HI> Doctrine, concerning the <HI>Transmigration of the Soul;</HI> therefore they neither kill nor eat any animated Creature.</P>
<P>They go clothed in white Paper made of Trees, of which they tie only one piece about their Head, and another about their Middle, for decency.</P>
<P>This Isle hath all manner of good Provisions, though not in very great plenty; but abundance of Birds, which are from thence Transported to <HI>China</HI> for a great Dainty.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>Iuly,</HI> about Noon, the Fleet finding it self in twenty five Minutes South-Latitude, spy'd the East Point of the Isle of <HI>Linge,</HI> North-West from them; and <HI>Poele Zay,</HI> South-West and by West, in eighteen and nineteen Fa|thom grey Sandy Ground, mixt with little Shells; their Course North and by East; the Wind at South-East and by South.</P>
<P><HI>Poele Zay</HI> are several small Rocky Isles, and uninhabited, lying in a Train<NOTE PLACE="marg">Poele Zay.</NOTE> one by another.</P>
<P>The second, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> the Fleet Sail'd about Noon in fifty three Minutes Northern Latitude.</P>
<P>In the afternoon the Pink <HI>Loosduynen</HI> being seven Leagues to the Eastward of the Island <HI>Poele Panjang,</HI> ran on unknown Rocks, not specifi'd in the Maps, to which the Vice-Admiral <HI>Iohn Van Campen</HI> Rowing with his Boat, and some Tackle, giving speedy assistance, helpt the Pink off from the Rocks without any Damage.</P>
<P><HI>Poele Panjang,</HI> signifies, <HI>Long Island,</HI> so call'd from its narrowness and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Poele Panjang.</NOTE> great length, it is uninhabited, but full of Woods, where a Bird by the <HI>In|dians</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="37">

call'd <HI>Emy,</HI> or <HI>Emeu,</HI> breeds. He hath a long Neck, which when he stretch|eth out, makes him at least four Foot high; before at his Throat hang two Lappets, like slips of Parchment, two Inches long, and red. His Neck, as <HI>Clusius</HI> relates, is about thirteen Inches long, and his Body two Foot broad, and three Foot long from Breast to Stern; his Legs seventeen Inches long: The Feathers with which his whole Body was cover'd, were all double, being grown out of one little and short Quill, and lying one upon another, were thick at the ends, and thin and small at the Root, and of several lengths. These Feathers resembled rather a Bears Fur than Plumes: His Wings consist|ed chiefly of four long black Quills; but the upper part thereof had the same kind of Feathers that grew on the Breast; for it is to be suppos'd that with these Wings he helps himself in running, not being able either to fly, or lift himself from the Ground. The Head holds no proportion to the Body, be|ing little, and almost bald: The Eyes, a little above the opening of the Bill, were very big and sparkling: Upon the top of his Head grew a Crest or Comb, hard as Horn: The upper part of his Bill five Inches long; the fore|part of the Neck, about four Inches below the Bill, had two fleshy Gills, two Inches long, of ruddy colour; the hindermost part of the Neck also bald, and from the Head to the Back reddish, and the lower part cover'd with a few red Feathers, mix'd with some black. And although this Bird seems to resemble the Ostrich, taking all things that are thrown before him, yet he hath not cloven Feet, but three very strong Claws, with which side-ways he seizes his Prey. But though he swallow'd what-ever was cast to him, as whole Oranges, and the like; yet his usual Food was Wheaten or Rye-Bread, which broken in great pieces, he gobbles up; and mad after new-laid Eggs, which went down Shells and all; but if they were hard, or lay heavy upon his Sto|mach, he muted them, and then taking them the second time, digesting, put them well over. These Birds, they say, breed not onely on the <HI>Molucco</HI> Islands, but also on <HI>Sumatra, Taprobane,</HI> and in the neighboring Countreys.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="38">On <HI>Munday,</HI> being the third, the Fleet proceeded on her Course North-North-East, full before the Wind, and reach'd about Noon in two Degrees and three Minutes Northern Latitude, and in sight of the Island <HI>Poele Tingi&punc;</HI> which lay North-West from them. In the first Watch the <HI>Zierikzee</HI> and <HI>Ter-Boede</HI> Frigats came to an Anchor on the West side of <HI>Aura,</HI> in thirteen Fathom Water, and put each of them a Light in their Lanthorns, for a Sign to those Ships that were behind.</P>
<P>The fourth, being <HI>Tuesday,</HI> the Admiral with the <HI>Naerden</HI> Frigat, accompa|nied with the <HI>Overveen, Sea-dog, Singing-bird, High-land,</HI> and <HI>Vink,</HI> came to an An|chor in the same place; for the <HI>Domburg,</HI> and six more, took their Course to the Isle of <HI>Timon,</HI> according to Order when they set sail: Their Boats going ashore to fetch fresh Water and Wood, brought also many Baskets of Fish and Fruits, besides some Hens and Goats, which they either bought for Money, or barter'd for.</P>
<P>Next Morning, being the fifth, the <HI>Singing-bird, Sea-dog,</HI> and the <HI>Gold|finch</HI> weigh'd their Anchors, and sail'd to <HI>Poele Pisang</HI> for fresh Provisions and Wood. This Island is Populous, and full of Villages. All the In|habitants observe strictly their Fishing and Tillage, being bred to such Drud|gery from their Childhood. Here, as also on the Coast of the Kingdom of <HI>Sampan,</HI> and on the Island <HI>Lingen,</HI> a kind of Birds-nests are plentifully found<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strange Birds-nests.</NOTE> which at Feasts and Entertainments are look'd upon as a great <HI>Regalia;</HI> nay, the Inhabitants on their New-years Feast, which they keep with great Solemnity, commonly present one another with these Dainties, as an infallible sign of unfeigned Friendship. They are also transported, as a great Delicate, to <HI>Chi|na,</HI> and every Pound thereof sold for half a <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">That is, about two <HI>Spanish</HI> Duckets.</NOTE> <HI>Tahers,</HI> they being a great Cordial, much relieving both the Stomach and Brain.</P>
<P>A Bird like a Swallow, about the time of the year when they chuse Mates, and fall to coupling, yields a kind of glutinous or slimy matter, which lying on the Rocks, is the first Material of these Nests, and by a daily additional Moisture, or Morning-dew, gather'd on their Wings, and sprinkled on it, at last becomes both large and perfect, which when dry, resembles the Bowl of a Spoon, with high Edges, and are found here in such abundance, that they gather some Hundred weights of them yearly.</P>
<P>When their Coupling time is past, and the Nests finish'd, which happens all at one time, they lay their Eggs, and Brood upon them; which Father <HI>Kir|cher</HI> thus describes.</P>
<Q><P>Between <HI>Cochinchina</HI> and the Island <HI>Hainan,</HI> lie in a long Ridge a Series both of great and lesser Rocks, to which in <HI>March</HI> flock abundance of strange Birds like Swallows, there building their Nests, but of what, or how, not known; and having bred up their Young fit for flight, they quit their Birth-place, and leave their empty Nests, which Ships coming thither from <HI>China</HI> and other places, transport from thence, and sell at home at great Rates, because they are esteem'd as the onely Condiment either to Fish or Flesh, which be|ing handsomly season'd with it, gives a delightful <HI>Hogooe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Philip Martyn,</HI> in his Relation of the Kingdom of <HI>Tunking,</HI> saith, That in that Province are many strange Birds and Fowls, especially some little ones, that fly like a Swallow, making their Nests on the Rocks, which are ga|ther'd, and sold at no ordinary price, because they believe that they owe their Health to the use of them mix'd in their Dishes, and that it is a certain Cure for the loss of Appetite.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="38">They are of a bright colour, and hard, like Sea-horn; and they esteem the greatest Feast no Entertainment without this Dainty, which they prepare af|ter this manner: First they lay it a whole Night in warm Water, till it grows soft and mellow; then again dried in the Sun, mince it very small.</P><P>It hath of it self almost no taste; but, like Mushrooms prepar'd in Sal|lads, provokes an Appetite; and as other Food asswages Hunger, and sa|tisfies the Stomach, this, on the contrary, makes the Appetite greater, and still desirous of more.</P>
<P>There is also much <HI>Ager</HI>-Wood, and Cotton.</P></Q>
<P>On <HI>Thursday</HI> the sixth, Admiral <HI>Bort</HI> firing a Gun from the <HI>Naerden</HI>-Frigat, signified his intention to set Sail; but no sooner had he weigh'd his Anchor, but the Ship was strongly driven by the Current towards the Shore, so that he was forc'd to let it fall again, and firing several Guns, the Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Campen</HI> coming thither with his Pinnace, Long-boat, and Tackling, found the <HI>Naerden</HI> Frigat to ride about three Cables length from the Rocks, on good Ground, able enough to hold out a great Storm: But carrying out a small An|chor, and weighing the other, at last got under Sail, and was follow'd by the rest of the Ships.</P>
<P>The seventh, being <HI>Friday,</HI> the <HI>Zierikzee, Highland,</HI> and <HI>Ter-Boede</HI> Frigats came about the East side of the Isle of <HI>Timon</HI> (for the <HI>Naerden</HI> and the other Ships lay at the North-East Point) to an Anchor in thirteen Fathom, where they took in Water, Firing, and fresh Provisions, as Hens, Goats, Fish, Potatoes, and the like.</P>
<P>The eighth, being <HI>Saturday,</HI> the <HI>Zierikzees</HI> Men going into the Woods, cut Anchor-stocks, Oars, Hand-spikes, and Leavers; and fishing in their Sloop, took some <HI>Shepherds</HI> and <HI>Breams.</HI></P>
<P>About Noon hapned a great Thunder-shower.</P>
<P>The ninth day, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> the <HI>Zierikzee, Highland,</HI> and <HI>Ter-Boede,</HI> weigh|ing their Anchors, ran to the North-East Point of <HI>Timon,</HI> to the <HI>Naerden,</HI> and the other Ships.</P>
<P>Admiral <HI>Bort</HI> putting out his white Flag to call a Council, they judg'd it convenient to steer further out from the Shore, and also seal'd their Orders.</P>
<P>The Admiral here complaining that he had many young and unexperienc'd People in his Ship, Order was immediately given, That two of the stoutest Sea-men should be taken out of each of the other Ships, except the <HI>Gold-finch,</HI> and put aboard of him.</P>
<P>In the afternoon the Fleet set sail, and took their Course North-North-East, and saw the Isle of <HI>Timon</HI> about Sun-set, bearing South and by West, and South-South-West, about five or six Leagues distant.</P>
<P>The tenth in the afternoon, under three Degrees and eight Minutes, the Fleet had thirty eight Fathom Water, sandy Ground.</P>
<P>But by the eleventh at Noon they had reach'd five Degrees and four Mi|nutes Northern Latitude, and in forty and forty one Fathom Water, gravelly Ground.</P>
<P>The next day at Noon they were in five Degrees and fifty six Minutes, and had thirty nine Fathom Water.</P>
<P>The thirteenth, the Fleet being in seven Degrees and six Minutes, had twenty nine, thirty, and thirty one Fathom Water: But the <HI>Naerden</HI> sailing with his Squadron about the East, had almost lost sight of the <HI>Zierikzee.</HI></P>
<P>The fourteenth about Noon the Fleet was in eight Degrees and sixteen Mi|nutes,
<PB N="62" REF="39">
and had twenty two and twenty three Fathom Water, fine sandy Ground, mix'd with white Gravel. At Night, about the latter end of the first Watch, appear'd the two Isles lying to the West of the Island <HI>Poele</HI> or <HI>Candor,</HI> a League from the Fleet, which had eighteen Fathom Water. This <HI>Poele</HI> or <HI>Candor</HI> lies in the Bay of <HI>Siam,</HI> near the Coast of <HI>Vancinaer Cambodia,</HI> uninhabited, and about three or four Leagues in Circumference, surrounded with high Rocks and Mountains, crown'd with shady Trees, and abounding with good Provi|sion, to the great refreshment of those Ships that put in there.</P>
<P>The fifteenth in the Morning the Fleet came up with the North-East Point of <HI>Candor,</HI> which bore South-East and by East about three or four Leagues di|stance from them, in the depth of seventeen and eighteen Fathom Water, white Sand, mix'd with small Pebbles.</P>
<P>The sixteenth in the Morning they sail'd in fifteen and sixteen Fathom Wa|ter, the <HI>Table-Mount</HI> being North-East, about three Leagues from the Shore. About Noon they found themselves by observation in ten Degrees and thirty one Minutes Northern Latitude, and had fifteen Fathom Water, about three Leagues from the Coast of <HI>Champa.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Champa,</HI> so call'd according to <HI>Texeira,</HI> from the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Pronunciation, <HI>Champa;</HI> by <HI>Martinius, Changpa;</HI> and by others, <HI>Ciampa,</HI> is a Kingdom, which hath the Principality of <HI>Camboya</HI> on the West, and, according to Father <HI>Lerin,</HI> that of <HI>Laos,</HI> from which it is separated by the vast Desarts and Mountains of <HI>Samao;</HI> the East respects <HI>Cochinchina</HI> and <HI>Tunking,</HI> and reaches with its Coasts to the main Continent of <HI>China,</HI> before you come to the Shore against the Island of <HI>Makou.</HI></P>

<P>The Countrey is Govern'd by a King, that Rules, neither acknowledging Subjection to the Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> the <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> or any other Supe|rior. The Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Campen</HI> spoke with the King himself, who sate in a great Court, in a very large Hall, hung with rich Tapestry; but was not permitted to enter the Presence, till he pull'd off his Shoes and Stockings, be|cause none may appear before the King unless bare-footed, such was their Custom of due Reverence.</P>

<P>The seventeenth, in the Night, the Fleet doubled the South Point of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bay of <HI>Pangerang.</HI></NOTE> Bay of <HI>Pangerang,</HI> which bore West and by South about three Leagues from them. In the bottom of this Bay, being a most convenient Harbor for Ships, stands a great City, whose Jurisdiction extends a vast way into the Countrey, and Govern'd by a peculiar King. The Vice-Admiral going ashore, spake with him with his Shoes and Stockins on, and was presented by the King with soms Fans and Stuffs. The Countrey thereabouts abounds with <HI>Calamback</HI>-Wood.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lignum Aloes.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Fleet steering North and by East, found her self about Noon to be in eleven Degrees and thirty five Minutes, about three Leagues from the <HI>Champan</HI> Shore. In the Morning they plied about the five Islands, close by the foremen|tion'd Coast, the Southermost part of which appears like a round Hay-stack.</P>
<P>The eighteenth, at Noon, by Observation they found themselves in twelve Degrees and thirteen Minutes, two Leagues from the Shore, in seventy Fathom Water.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wednesday</HI> about Sun-rising the Fleet made <HI>St. Iohn de Fyks,</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Champan,</HI> North-East and by North, about three Leagues from them, and at Noon were in thirteen Degrees and five Minutes Northern Latitude; and Coasted about Sun-set <HI>Cabo Avarelles,</HI> which lay Northerly from them, steering North and by East.</P>
<P><HI>Cabo Avarelles</HI> being a very high Mountain, appears a great distance off like a Man on Horse-back, and serves for a Beacon.</P>
<P>The twentieth they found themselves in thirteen Degrees and forty nine Mi|nutes, and saw the Point of <HI>Poele Candor,</HI> North and by East, a good distance from them.</P>
<P>The one and twentieth, in the Day-watch, the Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Campen</HI> (for the Admiral <HI>Bort</HI> going that Night with seven Ships about the East, was by break of day gotten quite out of sight) with the Ships belonging to his Squa|dron, came opposite to the Northermost of the <HI>Box-Islands,</HI> and spied four Sail,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Box-Islands.</NOTE> bearing North-East and by East, near the Coast of <HI>Champan,</HI> or <HI>Quinan;</HI> whe|ther he, and those that belong'd to the <HI>Ter-Boede,</HI> row'd with their Sloops well Mann'd and Arm'd; but three of them escaping, they took only one, which they carried aboard the Vice-Admiral, and found him to be laden with Rice, Honey and strong <HI>Arak,</HI> Mann'd with seven Men, and having also five proper Women aboard, that coming from <HI>Poeyan,</HI> intended to sail from <HI>Taywan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Poeyan.</NOTE> not far from thence. They judg'd it convenient to let them pass with their Vessel; but the Women would rather have staid with the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> if they might have had their desires; yet at their departure, they were presented with three Pieces of course white Linnen, which they receiv'd with great thank|fulness.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Poeyan,</HI> lying on the Coast of <HI>Quinan,</HI> at the foot of a Mountain, between two Rivers, is surrounded with high thick Walls of Stone, fit to plant Guns upon. Their Fortresses are not fortified with Towers, but here and there with some Galleries eighteen Foot high, to which they ascend by a Ladder, and from thence assail their Enemies.</P>
<P>The City hath three straight and long Streets, which all concenter before the Royal Palace, from whence one leads to the Sea, the second to one of the City-Gates, and the third to the Mountain-Gate. None of the Streets are
<PB N="64" REF="40">
pav'd, except those three; for the other By-Lanes and Alleys are Sandy. And notwithstanding the whole may be Navigated by Channels that run through every Street, which receive their Waters from the foremention'd Rivers, yet are they very foul, because when the Water falls, it goes off so slowly.</P>
<P>Near the Court, on the West side of the City, stands a spacious Temple; on the East-side, the Arsenal; and on the South side, the Kings Palace, artifi|cially built, with spacious Courts and Walks within. At the end of the Street that leads into the Countrey, stand the Mayor or Chief Magistrates House, wherein all the Kings Servants or Slaves reside, and where are also his Stables, and other Offices.</P>
<P>The City stands divided into four parts, over every one of which a No|ble-man hath the chief Command in time of War, Fire, or other Accidents. In each of these is also a Drum, as big as a <HI>Rhenish</HI>-Wine Fat, whereon they beat with a Hammer, which always hangs near it, when any Uproar happens.</P>
<P>The Merchandise to be had there, are all sorts of Wrought and un-wrought Silks, flower'd and plain, of divers Colours; as <HI>Peelings, Hokiens,</HI> and the like: They trade also in white Linnen.</P>
<P>At Noon the Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Campen</HI> found himself in fourteen Degrees and forty Minutes Northern Latitude, and in the Morning came up with Ad|miral <HI>Van Bort,</HI> with seven Ships and a Jonk.</P>
<P>The twenty second, about Sun-rising, the Fleet spied <HI>Poele Canton,</HI> North-West<NOTE PLACE="marg">Poele Canton.</NOTE> and by North, about five Leagues from them, and were in the Latitude of fifteen Degrees and thirty one Minutes, their Course North-East.</P>
<P>The twenty third the Fleet was in sixteen Degrees and fourteen Minutes North Latitude.</P>
<P>The twenty fourth, being <HI>Munday,</HI> they discover'd the Island <HI>Hainan,</HI> at a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Island <HI>Hainan.</HI></NOTE> good distance from them; and taking observation at Noon, were in eighteen Degrees and fifteen Minutes, about four or five Leagues South-East from <HI>Hainan.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty fifth about Noon they reach'd nineteen Degrees and fifty one Minutes.</P>
<P>The twenty sixth they had twenty one Degrees and seven Minutes North Latitude, and were within four or five Leagues, bearing South-South-West, from the Southermost Island of <HI>Macao,</HI> or <HI>Macau,</HI> in twenty six and twenty se|ven Fathom Water.</P>
<P>The twenty seventh the <HI>Zierikzee</HI> and <HI>Ter-Boede</HI> cast Anchor in the Evening near the Island of <HI>Macau,</HI> by the <HI>Box-Heads,</HI> being separated from the rest of the Fleet by Misty Weather, that being the appointed Rendezvouz, where they were to meet, if by any Accident they should lose one another.</P>
<P>The next day in the Forenoon <HI>Indiik,</HI> accompanied with the <HI>Loosduinen, Sing|ing-bird,</HI> and three Frigats, <HI>Domburgh, High-land,</HI> and <HI>Meliskerke,</HI> came to an An|chor in the same place, under the Coast of <HI>Macau,</HI> in thirteen Fathom Water, gravelly Ground, which made up their Number eight.</P>
<P>The Islands of <HI>Macau</HI> receive their Denomination from the City of the same name, scituate on a small hanging Islet, joyn'd to one that is somewhat bigger; a Ship may without danger in Stormy Weather Sail betwixt, and there lie Land-lock'd, riding in an always smooth Sea, where they never want store of Fresh-water from the living Spring.</P>
<P>The twenty ninth, being <HI>Saturday, Indiik</HI> by putting out a white Flag, gave the Signal to the Commanders of the other Ships to come aboard to Coun|cil,
<PB N="65" REF="40">
where it was judg'd convenient, because <HI>Indiik</HI> suppos'd that the staying with the Ships bound for <HI>Iapan</HI> would be chargeable, to weigh Anchor in the Morning, put again to Sea, and sail through the Isles of <HI>Macau,</HI> ordering every Ship now and then to fire a Gun, in hopes thereby to meet again with the other five. Their Course being Nor-East by East, and Nor-Nor-East, in six|teen, seventeen, and eighteen Fathom, gravelly Ground, about nine of the Clock they bore up with one of the greatest of the <HI>Macau</HI> Islands, in <HI>Portu|guese</HI> call'd <HI>Ilhas de Lemas,</HI> where they saw five <HI>Champans</HI> or Jonks lying neer the Shore, which had a few Houses. Here also eight of the Fleet dropp'd An|chor; for <HI>Indiik</HI> with two laden Flyboats steer'd for <HI>Iapan.</HI></P>
<P>The Boats went ashore well Mann'd, where they found five great <HI>Champans</HI> with their Fishing-Nets, and above five thousand dried and salted <HI>Shepherd-Fish,</HI> with two hundred Pots of the Rows of the same Fish pickled.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> taking their flight into the Woods, so left all their Goods to the disposal of the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> onely three were overtaken by the Sea-men, and carried aboard the Vice-Admiral, who asking them from whence they came, they told him, <HI>From Xantung,</HI> and also inform'd him of <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Death, who were glad of the News, and paid the poor Men for their Fish.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon they joyn'd with the Admiral <HI>Bort,</HI> and the other lost and separated Vessels, which lay at Anchor full three Leagues to Lee-ward of the most Easterly <HI>Macaan</HI> Isles, where they were not able to row ashore with their Boats, because of the swiftness of the Current.</P>
<P>The Admiral making the usual Signal, the rest of the Captains came aboard, where he ruffling a little, and chiding them for not keeping their Rendezvouz according to Order, he set upon each of them the Penalty to bring him aboard eight Hogsheads of Water.</P>
<P>The one and thirtieth in the Morning the Fleet setting sail, was at Noon in twenty two Degrees and twelve Minutes, a League and a half North-East and by East from <HI>Pedro Branke.</HI></P>
<P>About Noon spying five Sail in the North-East, the Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Cam|pen</HI> made Chase after them, and coming up with one in the Evening, took it, with three <HI>Chineses</HI> from <HI>Tamsua,</HI> and some fresh and salt Fish.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tuesday,</HI> the first of <HI>August,</HI> the Vice-Admiral went aboard the <HI>Naerden</HI> Frigat, to know what he should do with the three <HI>Chineses</HI> and their Vessel: <HI>Bort</HI> replied, <HI>That he should let them go.</HI></P>
<P>At Noon the Fleet was in twenty two Degrees and thirty six Minutes, in twenty and twenty one Fathom Water, fine Sandy Ground, mix'd with Shells; and the next day at Noon, in twenty three Degrees and thirty eight Minutes, bearing about three Leagues West-South-West from the Island <HI>Tang Goie,</HI> in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tang Goie.</NOTE> twenty two and twenty three Fathom Water, Sandy Ground, mix'd with small Shells, their Course North-East and by East.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon they spied several Fisher-Boats in the North-East, which the Admiral and Vice-Admiral order'd to be chased: The <HI>Loenen</HI> Pink overta|king one of them, found onely one Man in her, the rest escaping by swimming.</P>
<P>The third, the Fleet came up with the Point of <HI>Puthay,</HI> lying on the main<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape Puthay.</NOTE> Coast of <HI>China,</HI> Northward from them, their Course North-East and by North along the Shore. This Point of Land appears in Prospect Mountainous, yet full of Valleys and Plains, planted with Trees of a wondrous height, whose Wood is as black as Pitch, and as hard and smooth as polish'd Marble or Ivory; some resembling Ebony; some a reddish Colour, and others yellowlike Wax.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="41">The Admiral putting out the Signal, commanded all the Officers to come aboard, and caus'd the <HI>Chinese</HI> Prisoners to be ask'd in their presence, From whence they came? If they had no knowledge of the <HI>Tartars</HI> Army? And where <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Fleet lay? Whereupon they replied, That <HI>Coxinga</HI> was dead, that the <HI>Tartars</HI> had a great Army near <HI>Chinkzieu</HI> and <HI>Zwansifoe;</HI> and that they were fitting out abundance of great and small Jonks in all the Havens, to War against <HI>Coxinga.</HI></P>
<P>In the Night the Fleet sail'd by the Island <HI>Quemuy,</HI> to the great dislike of the Admiral <HI>Bort,</HI> and contrary to the General and <HI>Indian</HI> Councils Order, which notwithstanding none of the Commanders knew, onely that the Vice-Admiral <HI>Campen</HI> had direction, That if the Ships should be separated from one another in the Southern <HI>Mouzon,</HI> they should stay at the North Point of the Island <HI>Que|muy;</HI> and in the Northern <HI>Mouzon,</HI> at the Promontory of <HI>Puthay,</HI> lying about two Leagues North-East from <HI>Quemuy;</HI> or else, in and before the River <HI>Hok|sieu.</HI> On this Island <HI>Quemuy</HI> appear two Towers; the one with a Spiry Point; the other, being that of the City <HI>Engely,</HI> flat and broad.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Engely,</HI> which stood on the Island <HI>Quemuy,</HI> was pull'd down, to prevent that <HI>Coxinga</HI> might not possess or harbor there; and at present there appears onely some few Ruines of it, not far from the Sea-side.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon the Fleet rais'd twenty four Degrees and forty six Minutes, about two Leagues and a half from the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> where in the South-South-East they spied three Jonks, which the Admiral and all his Fleet chas'd, but they escap'd by their nimble Sailing. About Sun-set they were three Leagues distant from an Isle lying at the South Point of the <HI>Storm-bay,</HI> where|on stands a Tower built like a Pyramide.</P>
<P>This <HI>Storm-bay</HI> makes a convenient Harbor for safety in bad Weather, or to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Storm-Bay.</NOTE> take in Provisions. On the Shore are divers Towers, with several Entrances, adorn'd with Images of their Gods, and before whose chief Gate by turns one of their Priests keeps continual Watch.</P>
<P>On <HI>Fryday,</HI> being the fourth, about Noon, the Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Campen</HI> de|scried the <HI>Cape of the Cavalles,</HI> in twenty five Degrees and thirty seven Minutes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cape of Cavalles.</NOTE> about two or three Leagues East and by North from the <HI>Rough Isle,</HI> in the depth of thirty four and thirty five Fathom Water, their Course North-North-East.</P>
<P>This Point of <HI>Cavalles</HI> is a great Promontory, full of many handsom Towns and Villages, and exceeding fertile; for besides the great conveni|ences of Rivers, all sorts of Provisions may be purchased there at a cheap rate, as Sheep, Swine, Poultrey, and the like; there are also Oranges, Lemons, Citrons, and several other Fruits of that kind, especially one shap'd like a Pear, with a thin Shell, resembling the outward Husk of a Chesnut, white within, and of a delicious taste; they preserve it in Sugar and Oyl, because if boyl'd, it loseth the relish: The Horses of this place are generally very small.</P>
<P>Near this Point lye certain desolate and barren Isles, which by the <HI>Nether|landers</HI> are generally call'd the <HI>Cavalles.</HI></P>
<P>The fifth the Vice-Admiral was by a Storm and hollow Sea separated from the other Ships, when he saw three Isles not appearing in the Maps, about three Leagues South-West and by South from him, in the depth of thirty one and thirty two, and sometimes twenty seven, twenty five, and twenty four Fa|thom Water, muddy Ground. About Noon they found thirteen several Isles in the Latitude of twenty seven Degrees, all which the Vice-Admiral sup|pos'd to be the Isles of the <HI>Old Sayer.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="41">Thither the Vice-Admiral sail'd, to wait for the Admiral and the other eight Ships, where he was so ruffled by a sudden Storm, that his Main-Mast had like to come over-board, his Sails and Rigging much torn; yet at last he came to an Anchor, with his four Ships, in twenty seven Degrees and nine Minutes Northern Elevation.</P>
<P>The sixth the Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Campen</HI> commanded the Officers of the Ships that were with him to come aboard, to know of them if they were inclin'd (not to spend any time in vain) to seek for the Admiral, with the other eight Ships, by sailing Southerly or Northerly, because his Orders on the third of the same Month were to meet in the Latitude of twenty seven Degrees and thirty Minutes before the City <HI>Hoksieu</HI> (if possible,) if they should happen by Storm to be separated one from another, and there to inquire after the state of the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Van Campen</HI> judg'd it convenient to sail but fourteen or fifteen Leagues to|wards the South, along the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> and if he miss'd of him there, to take his Course back again towards the North, or to stay there till they came to him, and then go together to find out their Admiral, which was agreed on.</P>
<P>The eighth <HI>Van Campen</HI> weigh'd Anchor with his Squadron, sailing a pretty way to the <HI>Offin,</HI> and then stood in towards the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> there to dis|cover some Haven or River, but saw a little to the Northward of a Cape on the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> six or seven Isles, which passing by, and plying several times from and towards the Shore, they came again to an Anchor behind the Isle where they had lain before.</P>
<P>The ninth the Vice-Admirals Pilot went ashore, to seek For Water, which he found running out of the Rocks, between the Hills: About Noon they weigh'd Anchor, and sail'd to a high Isle, unknown to them, and not found in the Map. In the Evening they spied ten or eleven Sail of Fishermen, to reach whom <HI>Van Campen</HI> sent his Pilot with a Sloop well Mann'd, and one who spoke some broken <HI>Chinese;</HI> but they onely overtook one of them, which they brought aboard, where they question'd them, From whence they came, and whereabouts <HI>Hoksieu</HI> was? They answer'd, From <HI>Kita,</HI> and that <HI>Hoksieu</HI> was about six or seven Leagues Southerly from them: And selling their taken Fish to the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> for three <HI>Spanish</HI> Rials, promis'd the next Morning to bring them Hens, Swine, and <HI>Chinese</HI> Apples aboard.</P>
<P>With Sun-set they came between the Main Coast of <HI>China,</HI> and four unknown Isles, and dropp'd their Anchors in thirteen Fathom Water, about Cannon|shot from the Shore. On the greatest stood a Light-house, with Burning Candles in it.</P>
<P>The tenth, being <HI>Thursday,</HI> the Vice-Admiral set Sail in the Morning to|wards the South-South-West, between the main Coast of <HI>China</HI> and the Islands, a Cannon-shot from the shore. On the Main Continent appear'd a House in a Bay. About Noon they were come back into twenty six Degrees and twen|ty seven Minutes, and in the Evening by calm, yet contrary Tides, enter'd the Bay of <HI>Kita,</HI> half a League Southward from an unknown Island.</P>
<P>The eleventh in the Morning <HI>Van Campen</HI> setting sail again, spied two Jonks lying before <HI>Tenhay,</HI> to which he sent <HI>Iacob Black,</HI> with a Boat and Skiff, Mann'd with armed Sea-men and Soldiers, to fight them; but the Jonks by swiftness of their Sails got clear off; yet in the Pursuit they saw in the North-West, near the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> three or four unknown Isles, and seven Ships at an Anchor near the Shore, which were the lost Ships, with the Admiral, that they were in quest of.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="42">About Noon the Vice-Admiral was commanded aboard of the Admiral <HI>Bort,</HI> by Captain <HI>Auke Pieterson,</HI> Master of the <HI>Ter-Boede</HI> Frigat, and inform'd by him, That he had taken nineteen Jonks, great and small, near <HI>Tenhay,</HI> six or seven of which they had fetch'd from the Shore, and burn'd the rest, except one, which was blown up by its own Powder.</P>
<P>The Booty of the taken Jonks consisted in forty one square Packs, nineteen Fardels, and five Bales of fine white Silk, a hundred and thirteen Pieces of <HI>Spiljauter,</HI> sixty seven Pigs of Lead great and small, two hundred sixty eight Bags of Pepper, besides sixty nine Guns and Blunderbusses.</P>
<P>The twelfth, being <HI>Saturday,</HI> the Fleet setting Sail, steer'd their Course to the River of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> to perform the Orders of the General and Council of <HI>India;</HI> but was forc'd by calm Weather, and contrary Tides, to come to an Anchor again in seven Fathom Water, a little to the Westward of the Bay, not far from the Land, border'd with a white sandy Shore.</P>
<P>In the hanging of the Mountain appear'd a great and well-built City, call'd <HI>Sotiha,</HI> whereof the Walls of one side were wash'd by the Sea.</P>
<P>Near the Shore, and against the Gates, lay some small Jonks, and many other Vessels, that were hall'd up above the Water-mark; whither the Admi|ral <HI>Bort,</HI> and Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Campen,</HI> in the afternoon sent ninety seven Sea|men, and one hundred and fifty Soldiers in five Boats and seven Sloops, with Command to set them all on fire (for they belong'd to <HI>Coxinga,</HI>) but to spare all Houses.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> coming near the Shore, were roughly entertain'd by the <HI>Chineses,</HI> with great Guns and Musquets; but being once Landed they met with little resistance, for the <HI>Chineses</HI> fled unto the Mountains: whereupon <HI>Van Campen</HI> entring the City with his Men, set a Watch in a great House near<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sotiha</HI> taken.</NOTE> the Gate, and sent the rest of his People in three Parties through the City.</P>
<P>This City <HI>Sotiha</HI> had been ruin'd and burnt by the <HI>Tartars</HI> about a year be|fore, but since that rebuilt with many handsom Houses, wherein they found good quantities of Rice, Salt, and dri'd Fish. Three <HI>Chineses</HI> were also taken, with four Women, but set at liberty again immediately. A young Woman was found Murder'd, but how none knew.</P>
<P>This Place is now inhabited chiefly by <HI>Chineses,</HI> short-hair'd like the <HI>Tartars,</HI> that maintain themselves with Fishing and Husbandry, being Licenced there|to by the Governor of <HI>Hoksieu.</HI></P>
<P>After the firing of twenty seven small and great Vessels Laden with Pepper, Silk, and other Commodities to be Transported to <HI>Iapan, Van Campen</HI> with his People in the Evening leaving the Shore went aboard, where he related his Adventures to the Admiral. Hence the Fleet Sail'd somewhat Southerly, and Anchor'd before the City <HI>Tenhay</HI> in nine Fathom Water.</P>
<P>This <HI>Tenhay</HI> hath no Walls, and inhabited onely by Fisher-men, and some Merchants.</P>
<P>The thirteenth being <HI>Sunday,</HI> the Fleet between <HI>Tenhay</HI> and the River <HI>Hoksieu</HI> came to Anchor in eight Fathom Water, where in the Bay of <HI>Linkun</HI> they espi'd some small Fisher-men with their Nets.</P>
<P>This Bay of <HI>Linkun</HI> lies also between the River <HI>Hoksieu</HI> and <HI>Tenhay,</HI> where some Priests coming to the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> requested of them a Pass, that they might go free if any of their Ships should meet with them at Sea, promising to do the same to them, if the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had occasion to travel by Land or Water.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="42">The Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Campen</HI> sent to the Admiral <HI>Bort,</HI> to know if the six Jonks should stay near <HI>Tenhay,</HI> or go into the River <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> that if a Storm should happen they might not be driven from their Anchors, with which they were but meanly provided, and had scarce Provision for six or seven Days. In the Night they saw many Fires upon the Mountains.</P>
<P>The fourteenth being <HI>Monday,</HI> in the Morning the Fleet Anchor'd near the Banks of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> about a League from the Shore, and to make their coming known to the <HI>Tartars, Bort</HI> commanded seven Guns to be fir'd from the <HI>Naerden</HI> Frigat, five from the <HI>Zierikzee,</HI> three from the <HI>Domburgh,</HI> and one from all the rest of the other Ships.</P>
<P>Here it was concluded, that Captain <HI>Abraham Pon,</HI> Commander of the <HI>Breukelen,</HI> with six Men, one Quarter-master, and the Interpreter <HI>Lakka,</HI> with three <HI>Tartars</HI> that came to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> at <HI>Tayowan</HI> the year before, should car|ry a Letter to the Governors and Vice-Roy.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tuesday</HI> the fifteenth the Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Campen,</HI> according as order'd the day before, Sail'd with two Frigats, three Pinks, besides the six foremention'd Jonks, towards <HI>Hoksieu</HI> or <HI>Chancheu,</HI> commonly call'd <HI>The River Chang,</HI> Steering his Course West and by South between two Sands near the <HI>White Rocks,</HI> which appear like Pyramids, and close by the North-east <HI>Foreland:</HI> and bringing the Pyramids on his Starboard, he alter'd his Course towards the South-west, through a narrow Channel six, seven, or eight Fathom deep gravelly Ground. Thence he Steer'd his Course East North-east, and Anchor'd in eight Fathom Water between two pleasant Isles, and left on his Starboard two other within Cannon-shot, which serv'd as safe Harbors for all Ships against foul Weather. Near the Evening <HI>Van Campen</HI> fell down with the Ebb out of the River, to|wards the Bar of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and came about four Glasses after Sun-set to the rest of the Fleet; where going Aboard the <HI>Naerden</HI> Fregat, he gave an account to the Admiral of Affairs, to his great satisfaction.</P>
<P>The sixteenth being <HI>Wednesday,</HI> the Fleet pass'd into the River <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and came presently after Noon with the Flood, by the high North-east Point of the Eastermost Island, having the <HI>White Rocks</HI> on their Starboard, and work|ing through a strong Ebb in a narrow Channel, they came to an Anchor in five Fathom Water, where immediately three handsom <HI>Chinese</HI> Vessels, with five grand <HI>Mandarins,</HI> came Aboard of the <HI>Naerden</HI> Fregat to the Admiral <HI>Bort,</HI> and with much Ceremony and Complement welcom'd both the Admiral and Vice-Admiral. At Low-water the <HI>Naerden</HI> Frigat sitting upon the Sand much troubled the Admiral, who call'd to <HI>Van Campen,</HI> telling him that he had brought the Ships to a bad Place to Anchor in; but he little regarding such a danger, repli'd, To Morrow, if it be the Admiral's pleasure, I will carry the Ships out of the River again.</P>
<P>The seventeenth in the Morning the Fleet weigh'd Anchor, and Sail'd along in five, six, seven, and eight Fathom Water: thence they Sail'd North|west up the River along the Northermost Island; against the middle of which being a safe Harbor, the Ships came to Anchor.</P>
<P>Not far from hence lay four Islands, formerly peopled, but now laid waste, and depopulated by the <HI>Tartars.</HI> A whole Moneth the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> lay near these four Islands, where they got all things in a plentiful manner, though the ordinary Sea-men were not permitted to go ashore without leave, and onely six at a time, because they should not be burdensom, nor affright the Inha|bitants.</P>

The Pilot of the <HI>Naerden</HI> Frigat carried in a <HI>Tar|tar</HI> Vessel, aboard of the Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Campen</HI> (who at that time being troubled with an Ague, could not be at the <HI>Mandarins</HI> Entertainment in the <HI>Naerden</HI>) one fat Calf, five Hens, five Ducks, three Water-Lemons, with a great Pot of <HI>Chinese</HI> Beer, all sent as a Present to <HI>Van Campen,</HI> from the Governors of <HI>Hoksieu</HI> and <HI>Minjazen.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty fourth a Corporal with four Souldiers was sent ashore with a Flag to the Island, being on the North side of the River, with Command to go to the top of the Mountains, and see if he could descry any Ships or Jonks: if they saw Ships, then they were to wave their Colours as many times as there were Vessels; if Jonks, betwixt every Flourish to fire a Gun.</P>

<P>The twenty sixth and twenty seventh nothing of remark hapned.</P>
<P>The twenty eighth three <HI>Chinese</HI> Vessels came with three <HI>Mandarins</HI> from <HI>Hok|sieu</HI> aboard the <HI>Naerden</HI> Frigat, and brought a Letter from the Governor there|of, and Commander of the Castle <HI>Minjazen:</HI> The Contents consisted in ma|ny Complements, with promise of Favors and all kindness from them both; likewise a free Grant to go unmolested up the River, and buy Necessaries for their Money for the Fleet; and lastly, wishing them a kind welcom into <HI>China:</HI> by which it appear'd, that the <HI>Tartars</HI> intended to joyn with the <HI>Nether|land</HI> Forces. The Letter being read, several Guns were fir'd from the <HI>Naerden.</HI></P>
<P>At Noon the three <HI>Mandarins</HI> taking their leave went away in the same Ves|sels, whilst five Cannons were fir'd in honor to them, and also three Vollies of small Shot: they carry'd with them a Letter from the Admiral <HI>Bort,</HI> written by the <HI>Chinese</HI> Interpreter <HI>Lakka,</HI> to the Governors of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> with many civil Expressions of thankfulness.</P>

<P><PB N="71" REF="43">The first of <HI>September</HI> all Officers were commanded by the Admiral to Land their Soldiers on the middle Island, and take up their Quarters in the best Houses of the ruin'd Town, with Order, that every Officer should furnish his Soldiers with all Necessaries for the Dressing of Meat, and to give them double allowance on the Shore of Rice, Pork, Oyl, Vinegar, and <HI>Arak,</HI> which daily occasion'd a murmuring amongst the Sea-men, who said, That they did the worst Work, and hazarded their Lives as well as the Soldiers, and there|fore ought rather to have the greatest allowance.</P>
<P>The second, being <HI>Saturday, Auke Peters,</HI> Commander of the <HI>Ter-Boede,</HI> and Captain <HI>Constantine Nobell,</HI> came back from <HI>Hoksieu</HI> (whither they were sent by Order of the Admiral on the thirtieth of the last Moneth) and brought with them to the Admiral in the <HI>Naerden,</HI> five Cows, thirty six Ducks, five great Pears, with some Pot-herbs.</P>
<P>The third, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Campen</HI> went ashore in his Sloop, where he saw divers Burying-places defaced by their own Soldiers, who out of hope to find Gold, Silver, or Jewels buried within, broke open the Chests, and threw out the Corps, which lay in all their Apparel, as Caps on their Heads, Coats, Breeches, and Shoes, and in their full shape, but as firm as a Mummy.</P>

<P>THe Reasons and Occasions are known, which have forc'd and mov'd<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Instructions of the Admiral to the Agents go|ing to <HI>Sinksieu.</HI></NOTE> Us and the Councel to send you to the chief Governors of the Terri|tory of <HI>Fokien,</HI> wherein <HI>Hoksieu</HI> is the Metropolis, and the usual Place of their Residence and Court, though at present they are not there, but lie Encam|ped with their Army near the City <HI>Zansifoe,</HI> about nine or ten days Jour|ney Post from <HI>Hoksieu.</HI> I say to you both, because <HI>Constantine Noble</HI> hath Order from the Lord-General and <HI>Indian</HI> Councel, to Negotiate and Con|clude that Affair with those great Officers, according to their Excellencies Order, and the Letters to the same Governors, <HI>viz.</HI> the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong,</HI> and General <HI>Taysing Lipovy:</HI> the Copies of which you having between you, must serve for your full Directions, without needing any rehearsal to be made of them; so that We onely to obtain their Excellencies favor, entreat you to obey and observe these following Orders.</P>
<P>I. After you have taken leave of Us you shall go to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and at your arrival there, obtain Licence to repair to the Governor <HI>Haitingkong,</HI> and prof|fer him great Presents, and inform him that you are ready to travel to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Taysing Lipovy,</HI> with Letters to him from the Lord-General and Councel of <HI>Batavia,</HI> with a Request, that he would help you by a quck dispatch to go thither. In the Letter which he lately Writ to Us he he hath promised to provide all things fit for the Journey: whereupon We have Answer'd according to the Copy which you have, containing chiefly Our taken Resolution of the <HI>Domburghs</HI> staying here with the Presents to the fore-mention'd chief Governors; Our setting Sail with the other seven Ships about the North, to infest and gawl the Enemy, and Intentions to be here against your Return; and amongst other things, a quick Dispatch for your Journey: so that I hope you will find all things there in a readiness.</P>
<P>II. When you have left <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and come to <HI>Zansifoe,</HI> Commanded by the Lord <HI>Santing Houbethetok,</HI> who seems to favor Our Designs, you shall deli|ver Our Letter to Him, and also these Presents, because with the Return of the Interpreter <HI>Iohn Melman</HI> (who hath already been with the said chief Go|vernors,) he Writ to Us, and thereby express'd his good Inclinations to|wards Us.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="44">The chiefest, nay the sole occasion of your Journey, is to deliver the Letters of their Excellencies before-mention'd to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong,</HI> and General <HI>Taysong Lipovy;</HI> and if they are so inclin'd, to Treat and Con|clude with them all those Affairs which they desire of them in their Letters, and authoris'd us to Agree on, consisting chiefly in these Points.</P>
<P>First, to make an inviolable League with them, for the best and most ad|vantage of the <HI>Hollander,</HI> and destruction of theirs and our Enemies, being the Pyrate <HI>Coxinga</HI> and his Adherents.</P>
<P>Secondly, to obtain a free and unmolested Trade through the whole Em|pire of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>To which two chief Points are joyn'd some others which our Masters have commanded us, <HI>viz.</HI> to permit us to chuse some convenient Place for Factory, where there is a good Harbor for the securing of our Ships, and fit to fortifie against <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s assaults, and to that end keep a small Garrison of Soldiers there.</P>
<P>To promise to procure a Grant from the Great Emperor of <HI>China</HI> for that which they shall Conclude with you about.</P>
<P>That if they joyn with us against <HI>Coxinga,</HI> we will follow their Advice and Resolution: Nay, if they are inclin'd to drive <HI>Coxinga</HI> from <HI>Formosa,</HI> we will assist them, and carry part of their Forces in our Ships thither.</P>
<P>Yet nevertheless, that we at present will use our Ships to seize and con|quer <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Jonks, which Sail to and from <HI>Iapan,</HI> and likewise to hinder his Fishing behind the Mountain <HI>Tankoia</HI> on the South-side of <HI>Formosa,</HI> which begins every year with eighty or a hundred Jonks in the latter end of <HI>No|vember,</HI> and ends about the middle of <HI>Ianuary.</HI> But these Articles are strictly to be insisted upon, as of most concern for the destroying and disabling of the Enemy.</P>
<P>After delivery of your Letters you must wait for their Answers. If they should ask you if you have ought else to request of them that is not menti|on'd in the Letters, then tell them, That if they grant those, there is no other Business of any consequence to Treat about. But if you observe them not to be willing to consent to the chiefest Articles, you must ask them im|mediately what they resolve to grant us. Then accept of all things which redound to our Profit, and by all means extoll our Strength, and what we are able to perform by force of Arms, and the faithful Service which we shall be ready to do them when time requires, in assisting them with all things, whereby they may see our fidelity: nay, lend them our Ships and Men against the Enemy <HI>Coxinga,</HI> and all other Enemies of the Empire; for recom|pence of all which they desire nought else but a free Trade. If they should speak of Custom and other Taxes, desire them to tell you what they amount to, if reasonable, consent to it; for our People ought not to pay either more or less than their own Natives, which you are to take notice of. We are afraid, that at present they will not permit us to Traffick, nor Conclude on any thing concerning it, but deny the Request, and onely speak and debate about the business of War. If so, and observing that to press it on any long|er, or more, all other Business might be neglected, we judge it convenient to take no Cognizance of it at this time; yet if any hopes be, to procure leave for the Sale of those few Merchandise laden in some of the Ships: what they are we desire you to see in the general Inventory of all the Goods. It may be that they will direct you to the Court at <HI>Peking,</HI> there to obtain
<PB N="74" REF="45">
the liberty of free Trade from the Emperor, and also to advise us to send another Embassy from <HI>Batavia,</HI> which you may assure them shall be done the next year. Yet nevertheless, if you cannot attain to our Desires, leave off further Suit, that so we may avoid such vast Expence and Charge: but if they be inclin'd to send to <HI>Batavia,</HI> you may seem to be very well pleas'd at it, and promise to Transport them thither in our Ships, except they will send one or two of their Jonks, which would be the better for us. Concern|ing the possessing and fortifying of a peculiar Place, you may also desist from&punc; if you see them not to favor the Request, but to be satisfi'd that our Ships may lie in the Haven of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and there drive a Trade, provided they can be assur'd to lie safe, and without danger there. When you come to Agree with them concerning the War with <HI>Coxinga</HI> and his Party with our joynt Forces, take care that they oblige themselves thereto by Writing, and with us declare themselves Enemies to the same <HI>Coxinga</HI> and his Adhe|rents, and that they shall not without our knowledge, much less to our preju|dice, agree with the Enemy, which we will do also on our part. Moreover, make a strict enquiry, whether or no they have not already Treated, and are inclin'd to be reconcil'd to him, if he should submit himself to the Em|peror; this may be suspected, because they say <HI>Coxinga</HI> is dead, and his Son in <HI>Ayanny</HI> not concern'd at it: Which if you observe, let them by no means detain you, but hasten your self from thence and come to us; for the Vice-Admiral ought on all occasions to be in the Fleet, because his Presence is continually requir'd there: wherefore if he can come away before, let <HI>Nobel</HI> tarry there so long till he thinks he can effect no more by staying. If they desire us, with them, to agree with the Enemy, you may easily under|stand on what Articles, and with what advantage and satisfaction it may be done, though you conclude noton any thing.</P>
<P>If you can find out any means for the delivery of our Prisoners in <HI>Eymuy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">These were taken before by <HI>Coxinga.</HI></NOTE> let nothing be wanting to procure their liberty, because the General and Council in <HI>Batavia</HI> have highly recommended their Release to us; but that we should do nothing without acquainting them with it, and their consent. The Hostage with his Retinue shall be kept so long in the <HI>Domburgh,</HI> till perhaps by the advice of his Friends he may do something that may be requisite for that Business, because he also longs for his Liberty. The Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> and General <HI>Taysong Lipovy</HI> have every one sent us a Letter by the Interpreter <HI>Melman;</HI> we now therefore send an Answer to every one of them, to the same effect and purpose as theirs were, with some small Presents, as appears by the Copies which you have, to which I refer my self, desiring you to deliver them at a convenient time, either with their Excellencies Letters, or afterwards. The Presents which belong to them, and are signi|fi'd in their Excellencies Letters, I have caus'd to be taken out of the <HI>Naerden,</HI> and put into the <HI>Domburgh:</HI> By the same Copies you may see how they are Pack'd, and wherein they consist, which at all times shall be ready upon your Order, whose Acceptation you must in a manner press, although hither|to they have not been willing to receive. Of the Merchandise which are onely aboard the <HI>Domburgh,</HI> I also give you Patterns, if they should chance to fancy any of them; and likewise of the Goods sent along with you, that thereby you may see what Presents to give to one or other, as you shall think fit.</P>
<P>Lastly, I desire you to promote and advance His Excellency's and Councels
<PB N="75" REF="45">
Desires, which at present so highly concerns the Publick, with all care and diligence imaginable; and think, that if all things fall out successfully, you will get no small honor and advancement by it, which God grant, into whose Protection I commit you.</P>

<P>The next day after, having Shipp'd all their Necessaries for the Journey, and put the Presents into the Jonks, they took their leave of the Fleet, and Sail'd South and by West up the River of <HI>Hoksieu.</HI> Presently after Noon they pass'd by a Town call'd <HI>Quanto,</HI> lying on the North-west Shore, about a Mus|quet-shot up in the Countrey.</P>
<P>This <HI>Quanto</HI> is Wall'd, being about half an hours Walk in circumference, fortifi'd with Bulwarks and Watch-Towers, and strengthned with a great Garrison. Here, as in most Towns in <HI>China,</HI> are several <HI>Parades,</HI> for the Meet|ing and Exercising of Foot and Horse, and to Train them up in all sorts of Martial Discipline. There are also Exchanges, or Burses for the Sale of Mer|chandise, besides Markets where the Countrey People bring their Fruits and Provisions to sell.</P>
<P>A little farther the Agents pass'd by a populous Village call'd <HI>Sanwan,</HI> near the Shore.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Sanwan</HI> are ingenious Artificers, <HI>viz.</HI> Weavers, Smiths, Coopers, and other Labouring Trades, who live in peculiar Places of the Vil|lage apart one from another, and every Precinct under a particular Governor, who gives an account of all Differences and Misdemeanors to the chief Ma|gistrate.</P>
<P>All the Villages through which they pass'd in the Territory of <HI>Fokien</HI> are wild, and have daily Markets of Herbs, Fish, and Oysters.</P>
<P>After they pass'd on Southerly with their Retinue to the River which flows East and by South into the Sea, and hath a small Island in its Mouth, with a Sandy Shelf in the Channel, where they found on the North-west Shore the Village <HI>Sayon,</HI> and came after a little Sailing to the strong Fort <HI>Benantien,</HI> or <HI>Minjazen,</HI> which is fortifi'd with Towers, Walls, Bulwarks, and a broad Mole: it lieth three Leagues from <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> hath the bigness of a small Town, with several Streets and fair Houses, set forth with divers Tradesmens Shops, and in the middle a very large open Court, where on one side stands the Go|vernors House, and on the other a <HI>Pagode.</HI></P>
<P>Here <HI>Van Campen</HI> and <HI>Nobel</HI> went ashore with their whole Retinue, to Com|plement the Governor, and were receiv'd into the Fort by three <HI>Mandarins</HI> with the usual Ceremonies, who conducted them into a great Temple; but they could not speak with him by reason of his indisposition. After they had pre|sented them Bean-broth mix'd with Milk (which is accounted the greatest honor they can shew to any Person) they return'd with their Train into the Jonks, and after many Complements took their Leave. Being got about half a League high, there appear'd a most delightful and pleasant Place on the South-east side, call'd <HI>Plethoeu,</HI> or <HI>Pethou;</HI> and opposite to it on the North|west Shore, a large <HI>Pagode,</HI> nam'd <HI>Possang,</HI> by them held for one of their Wonders.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="46">On the other side of the River appears a spacious <HI>Area,</HI> built about with fair Edifices, and planted with Gardens, and Banquetting-houses in them. About four a Clock in the Evening they came to the South-east side, near a Stone-Bridge, built over the Water on Pillars and Arches, and cover'd close on the top with long and thick Planks, from Arch to Arch on each side thereof are Rails of blue Stone, here and there adorn'd with Dragons and Lions, Hew'n and Carv'd out. Over this Bridge four Horsemen may conveniently ride abrest.</P>
<P>The twentieth, being <HI>Wednesday,</HI> they went in two <HI>Pallakins,</HI> or Horse-Litters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Agents come to <HI>Hoksieu.</HI></NOTE> carry'd by four Horses, over the Bridge to the City <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> there to Comple|ment the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s Wifes Mother, and to present her with an Am|ber Necklace, and to speak with the Governor: Being pass'd over the Bridge, they found the High-ways built, the Streets pav'd, and crowded with thousands of People all along the City to the Palace, insomuch that they were scarce able to pass for the Throng.</P>
<P>The Vice-Roys Palace, in which at that time his Wifes Mother resided, was<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Viceroy's Palace.</NOTE> a handsom Edifice, surrounded with Walls of Free-stone, with great Portals and fair Gates, and guarded with Horse and Foot. At their entring they were courteously receiv'd by the Vice-Roy's Mother-in-law, who conducting them into a Hall furnish'd with Pictures and Stools, desir'd them to sit down. When seated, they were entertain'd each of them with a Cup full of Bean-broth, and afterwards they were all plac'd before a little Table, to eat both boyl'd and roasted Meats, serv'd up in Plate of Massy Gold. The Vice-Roys Brother (for he was also there) discoursed with them about several affairs, and amongst other things, ask'd of them if they had as great and well built Towns in <HI>Hol|land</HI> as they had in <HI>China?</HI> and if they had Horses, Cows, and Sheep there? to which they answer'd, that they had: Then he inquir'd how long they were coming from <HI>Holland</HI> to <HI>China?</HI> they reply'd, Six or seven Moneths. Then the Vice-Roy's Mother, who had many Women waiting upon her, came to them, saying, <HI>That she intended to have eat and drank with them, but her indisposition had hindred her; but would Write in their behalf to her Son the Vice-Roy, and at their return sit at Table with them: for you are</HI> (said she) <HI>in a strange Countrey full of People, and therefore had need be careful to Travel circumspectly, that you may meet with no inconveni|ence: Nay, she admir'd that they durst venture themselves where they knew no Place, nor any Person. Van Campen</HI> being ask'd what Place he bore, and how qua|lifi'd, answer'd, He was Vice-Admiral of the Fleet: whereupon she reply'd, <HI>Then your Princes and Lords must needs wear rich Apparel, and go bravely,</HI> being much taken with the Velvet Jump he had on. This pass'd, <HI>Van Campen</HI> and <HI>Nobel</HI> civilly taking their Leave of the Lady, parted from her, and went to the City Governor's House, Guarded both with Foot and Horse; by which pas|sing, and being entred, they soon return'd, upon a Servant's saying that his Lord was troubled with an Ague, and lay at rest in his Chamber, so that at present there was no opportunity to speak with him, wherefore he desir'd they would please to come again the next Morning: whereupon they were carry'd in <HI>Pallakins</HI> out of the City, the Streets being so crowded with Men, Women, and Children quite to the Bridge, where their Jonks lay, that they were scarce able to make their way through.</P>
<P>The one and twentieth, being <HI>Thursday,</HI> they were Visited in their Jonks by<NOTE PLACE="marg">They come to the Fort <HI>Engely.</HI></NOTE> the Governor of the Fort <HI>Engely,</HI> and several Grand <HI>Mandarins,</HI> who giving them a courteous welcome, Drank to each of them in Bean-broth.

his House; where after a noble Treat he presented <HI>Van Campen</HI> with a cu|rious Tent to use in his Journey, which folded, was but one Man's work to carry and pitch. When they had all Feasted very plentifully, the Governor led them over a Bridge towards the West-side of the Island whereon the Fort stood: near which lay a great Village, and well peopled. Here, being conduct|ed by the Governor, they saw several great Temples hung round with burning Lamps, and adorn'd with Altars and Images; into which entring upon curi|osity, the Priests presented them <HI>Tea,</HI> or <HI>Thee,</HI> and other Sweet-meats with more than ordinary respect. After a little stay they were brought into a de|lightful Place, where with a Bowe and Arrow they shot at a Mark: and from thence as they pass'd towards their Vessels, they went to the House of <HI>Han|lavia,</HI> Governor of the Fort <HI>Minjazen,</HI> where they were again Treated. In the Evening they came to their Jonks, to take their repose as they had done the Night before.</P>
<P>The two and twentieth in the Morning going again to <HI>Hanlavia,</HI> they pre|sented him with some red Cloth, thereby to obtain his favor and assistance in their speedy dispatch to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong.</HI> From thence they Rode to the City Governor's House, that he might furnish them with People for their Journey: where coming, they found him somewhat indispos'd; yet never|theless they had Audience in the same Place where he generally sits with the chiefest of the Countrey, consulting about publick affairs. Upon their asking if he would be assisting to them in their Journey to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Taysing Lipovy,</HI> he answer'd, That he would be ready to do all things that lay in his power, saying he had Writ in their behalf to the Emperor at the Court at <HI>Peking,</HI> and to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> in <HI>Sinksieu,</HI> and provided two <HI>Mandarins</HI> with ninety Men to Travel thither with them. Being ask'd if he thought it convenient for the Admiral to put to Sea with eleven Sail, to Cruise up and down to the Northward, if there he could, to annoy <HI>Coxinga</HI> and his Party, and leave one Frigat, in which the Presents were, in the River <HI>Hoksieu:</HI> he reply'd, That he durst not advise about it, but their Admiral in that case might do what he thought fit; yet as he suppos'd, it were better that the Ships stay'd there till the Vice-Roy's coming home, that there might be a better un|derstanding: However, you may go (said he) to the Governor of <HI>Minjazen, Hanlavia,</HI> and he will be better able to inform you in these punctillio's what to do. Hereupon they leaving <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> went about Noon to <HI>Hanlavia,</HI> by whom they were invited to Dinner; when taking opportunity to ask the same Que|stion, they receiv'd the like Answer, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Admiral might do what he thought fittest: all which <HI>Van Campen</HI> and <HI>Nobel</HI> writ to the Admiral <HI>Bort,</HI> with their Opinions. A little after Dinner they went with their Retinue into their Jonks, to proceed in their Journey to <HI>Sinksieu,</HI> and came about three a a Clock after Noon to the Fort <HI>Aulavia,</HI> or <HI>Lavyt,</HI> near a Ferry, where on the the Shore they were courteously receiv'd by the Governor, and entertain'd with the customary honor of Bean-broth.</P>
<P>The Fort <HI>Aulavia,</HI> surrounded with high Walls, hath a strong Garrison both<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fort <HI>Aulavia.</HI></NOTE> of Foot and Horse, and stor'd with all sorts of Ammunition and Provisions. Here whoever pass over, they pay Custom for all those Goods and Commodi|ties that are after sold and dispers'd through the Countrey.</P>
<P>Several Troops of Horse are daily sent out of this Fort, to keep the Ways clear from Thieves, which have their lurking-places in the neighboring Mountains.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="49">After some stay here they set Sail again, and in the Evening came to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Village <HI>Lanpon.</HI></NOTE> Village <HI>Lanpon,</HI> where they stay'd all Night. This <HI>Lanpon</HI> is a Place of good Repute, being inhabited by many rich <HI>Chineses,</HI> which drive a Trade through all the Countrey; and also much frequented by the neighboring People, be|cause of a Temple wherein they worship an Idol, said to give good and com|fortable advice in great misfortunes or adversities, and therefore visited daily both by rich and poor, that in their Troubles they may receive some consola|tion from him.</P>
<P>The twenty third, being <HI>Saturday,</HI> at nine a Clock they leaving <HI>Lanpon,</HI> went by Land in <HI>Palakins</HI> along a Cawsey pav'd with blue and gray Free-stone. This day they travell'd through abundance of Rice-Fields, and Plains full of Fruit-trees, and all manner of eatable Plants, scatter'd with many populous Villages, and moistned by murmuring Streams, that flowing out of the Moun|tains made it a most delightful Prospect. They also saw several antient Mo|numents, all Sculpt out with Imagery resembling Men, Horses, Lions, and Dragons; over which stately Arches rais'd high, like our, Triumphal with Inscriptions in <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters of Gold, being antient Epitaphs in honor of the Deceased. About Noon they came to two great Forts, and about six a Clock in the Evening into the City <HI>Hokzwa;</HI> which entring, they were receiv'd by the chiefest of the Town, and carry'd into a great House, provided for the most eminent Persons of the Countrey in their Journeys.</P>
<P>Here they had sent them for Presents three Pigs, twenty Hens, and four Geese; which they requited by returning some small Trifles. In the Night, by Order of the Magistrates of the Town, a Guard was set about their Lodgings, that they might suffer no injury by the Common People.</P>
<P>The twenty ninth, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> though they prepared for their Journey, yet they could not set forward for want of Convoy, because a strong Party of three hundred Horse was sent by the Vice-Roy's Mother, with Money and other Goods to the Army at <HI>Sinksieu,</HI> to her Son <HI>Singlamong,</HI> for the paying of the Souldiers, so that being forc'd to stay in <HI>Hokzwa</HI> all that day, they were visited by many great and eminent <HI>Mandarins</HI> of the City, and presented with Oranges, Pears, Chesnuts, Coco-Nuts, besides several other Fruits, two Pigs, five Geese, and ten Hens, in requital for Money and Goods worth full as much. The People seem'd to be very obliging, when they heard that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> lay with a Fleet on the Coast of <HI>China</HI> to joyn with them against the Islanders of <HI>Quemuy,</HI> and the rest of <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Party. In the afternoon they view'd the Town.</P>
<P>This City <HI>Hokzwa,</HI> lying in a pleasant Place, encompassed with many de|lightful<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City <HI>Hokzwa.</HI></NOTE> Gardens, contains several Markets and great Plains, and appears beau|tiful with divers Triumphal Arches, and stately antient Buildings, rang'd close together with Party-walls, not being usual in <HI>China.</HI> It hath thick and strong Walls, or rather Bulwarks, continually Guarded by many Horse and Foot. About an hours walking from thence are many pleasant Groves, with Arbors, and other like Receptions for such as Walk to refresh themselves in, where they call for all sorts of Fruit whatever they have a mind to, so making themselves merry.</P>
<P>The twenty fifth, being <HI>Monday,</HI> they began their Journey anew about day|break, with a Convoy of fifty <HI>Tartars;</HI> and passing by several strong Holds, and through many Villages, they came to two Rocks, which so straiten the Passage, that two Carts or Wagons can scarce go between: at each Entrance stands a
<PB N="79" REF="49">
Block-house, so that none can pass without leave. Upon the top of these Rocks, where there is no kind of Mould to be seen, grow many Cypress and Ash-Trees. About Noon passing by another Hold, the Governor invited them to Dinner, which they modestly refus'd by their Interpreter; yet their Reti|nue had as much strong <HI>Chinese</HI> Beer given them as they pleas'd to drink. Then proceeding on, in the Evening they pass'd through a Wall'd City, and well Garrison'd; and a little Southward from the City they took their repose in a <HI>Pagode,</HI> where several of the chief Citizens visiting, for welcom present|ed them with several Provisions, such as the Countrey afforded: in return whereof they gave them some <HI>Spanish</HI> Ryals, and four Pieces of course white Linnen: Besides, their Followers were entertain'd with two great Pots of strong <HI>Chinese</HI> Beer, a Drink very pleasing to their Palats.</P>
<P>The twenty sixth about Sun-rising, being ready for their Journey, they had such a concourse of Men, Women, and Children, which came to see them from all places, that they were scarce able to pass along the Streets, for the <HI>Palakin,</HI> or Sedan, in which the Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Campen</HI> was carry'd, was often stopt and held by the People to see his Face and speak with him: but because he could not answer them, and his Interpreter not being able to come to him through the Crowd, they let him pass. This Day they went by and through more Forts and Villages, and in the Evening came to the City <HI>Hokexcho,</HI> where they stay'd all Night, being Entertain'd by the eminentest of the Town, and visited by many antient Merchants, which stay'd with them so late, that they took but little rest.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Hokexcho</HI> lies but a days Journey from <HI>Hokzwa:</HI> whose Inhabi|tants maintain themselves for the most part by Husbandry, (for there are few Merchants) being a kind and hospitable People: for <HI>Hok</HI> signifies <HI>Good,</HI> and <HI>Zwa, Bad.</HI></P>
<P>Between <HI>Hokzwa</HI> and <HI>Hokexcho</HI> lies a Village, in which they make great quan|tities of Porcelin.</P>
<P>The twenty seventh before Sun-rising they betook themselves to their Jour|ney, accompany'd with several Troops of Horse and Foot; and pass'd most by and through several great strong Towns and Villages. About three a Clock in the Afternoon they Rode through a great Town, and in the Evening arriv'd at a strong Castle, where they were courteously receiv'd by the Governor, and first entertain'd with Bean-broth, afterwards caress'd both with Meat and Drink; which kindness they requited with other Presents.</P>
<P>The twenty eighth they proceeded again on their Journey very early, and in the Afternoon, about three a Clock, arriv'd at another City, where they were welcom'd and presented by the Magistrates with Provision, and receiv'd again in a bartering Return, as others had before: after which they drank <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine and Brandy with the Agents, shewing a great liking thereunto, having never tasted such Liquor; so that it was mid-night before they went away.</P>
<P>The twenty ninth, being <HI>Friday,</HI> they set forward again with the Dawn af|ter Day-break, beholding very many large and sumptuous Tombs, and stately antient Buildings, besides several Triumphal Arches, adorn'd with Horse|men, Tygers, Bears, Lyons, and Dragons, hew'n out of Free-stone, and the Arches beautifi'd with Golden Characters: Then they pass'd a long Bridge over the great River <HI>Loyang,</HI> consisting of divers Stone Arches, Pav'd with Free-stones of an incredible size, some of which being about seventy Foot long,
<PB N="80" REF="50">
three and a half broad, and half a Foot thick, on each side Rail'd in, and ac|commodated with Benches of blue Stone, with the Honors of the Empire, as Lyons, Dragons, and the like, on several Pedestals.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> report this Bridge to have been built in one Night by the An|gels, and look upon it as a great Wonder.</P>
<P>At the Bridge-foot stood an old House, and in it several Figures of Men gilded with Gold. In the same House also was a great blue Stone, inscrib'd with the antiquity of this wondrous Bridge.</P>
<P>The middle Arch of this Bridge had lately been broke down, to hinder the Enemy's Passage, about which they were then busie in mending, laying great Beams of Timber over the Gap.</P>
<P>A little before Noon they came to the City <HI>Zwansifoe,</HI> where at the Gates they were kindly welcom'd by three <HI>Mandarins</HI> (sent thither to meet them by <HI>Santing Houbethetok,</HI> Admiral of the Sea, and Governor of the Place,) and con|ducted into a great <HI>Pagode,</HI> where they were civilly entertain'd with a Draught of honorable Bean-broth: after having stay'd a little while, they entred the City in company with the same <HI>Mandarins,</HI> who carry'd them into a fair House, whither many of the eminentest Citizens out of curiosity came to visit them.</P>
<P>The Letter from the Admiral <HI>Bort</HI> to <HI>Santing Houbethetok,</HI> with the Presents, being a pair of Snaphance Pistols with Holsters, four Yards of Scarlet, and four Pieces of fine Linnen, were by the Agents two Interpreters <HI>Bedel</HI> and <HI>Lakka,</HI> sent to him: but he told them, That he durst not receive any Letters or Pre|sents before they came back again from <HI>Sinksieu,</HI> and had spoke with the Vice-Roy and General <HI>Lipovy:</HI> but he intended to have visited them, had not his present indisposition hindred him.</P>
<P>But <HI>Houbethetok</HI> caus'd his Servants to carry them Oranges, Nuts, Chesnuts, besides some Porkers, Hens, and Geese; for which they return'd the Servants good <HI>Spanish</HI> Coyn.</P>
<P>The next day, being the thirtieth, they with their Retinue went to see the City, whilst the Convoy made all things ready for their farther Journey.</P>
<P><HI>Zwansifoe</HI> is a Place of great Trade, full of Shops and Merchandise, adorn'd<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City <HI>Zwansifoe.</HI></NOTE> with several Triumphal Arches made of blue Stone, whereon Men, Women, Horses, Dragons, Tygers, Lyons, Bears, Apes, were all presented in Graven Work, to the Life, in their various Colours, and on the top the Names of those in honor of whom they were erected. It hath also three high Steeples, with Galleries about them; besides many inferior Temples.</P>
<P>The Wall about the City being twenty seven Foot high, and of equal thick|ness, is fortifi'd with many Bulwarks, Moats, and Breast-works: upon the top of it always lie heaps of Stones and Timber, for defence against sudden Storms or Assaults.</P>
<P>This City hath three Gates with winding Entrances, rais'd of great blue Stones, and was never Conquer'd by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> but deliver'd up by Collonel <HI>Houbethetok,</HI> conditionally, That he should still possess the Place of Governor: and likewise because of this free Surrender, the old Magistrates kept their seve|ral Offices, and the City their antient Priviledges and Liberties: yet as a sign of Conquest, the <HI>Tartars</HI> caus'd all the Steeples to be pull'd down, except the three before-mention'd. <HI>Coxinga</HI> once laid Siege to it, but was forc'd to leave it, and depart with the loss of many Men.</P>
<P>In the Morning about nine a Clock they proceeded on their Journey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City <HI>Engeling.</HI></NOTE> and at Noon travel'd by the ruin'd City <HI>Engeling,</HI> and all the day long past
<PB N="81" REF="50">
thorow, and in sight of divers strong Castles built of Stone, and many Villages.</P>
<P>About the Evening, they came to two great Forts, call'd <HI>Twaia,</HI> distant from<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forts <HI>Twaia.</HI></NOTE> each other a quarter of an Hours walking, whose Walls built of Free-Stone, were twenty five Foot high, and twenty eight thick.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>October,</HI> in the Morning, the Agents leaving these Forts, came about three a Clock with their Retinue, which consisted of above a hundred Persons, <HI>Hollanders, Chineses,</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> to the City <HI>Tanwa;</HI> surrounded with a Stone-Wall, and Fortifi'd with high Bulwarks and deep Trenches.</P>
<P><HI>Tanwa</HI> is accounted one of the most delightful and populous Cities of all <HI>Chi|na;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">City <HI>Tanwa&punc;</HI></NOTE> seated in a rich Valley, abounding with plenty of all things, so that ma|ny Merchants resorting thither, take up their Residence, to enjoy the benefit and pleasure of the adjacent Countrey.</P>
<P>Without the City are many stately Monuments, where the Towns men make daily Offerings to the Souls of their deceas'd Parents.</P>
<P>Three grand <HI>Mandarins</HI> well Mounted, and follow'd by a great Train of Servants, bidding the Agents welcome, carry'd them into a stately Inn, to which they ascended by seven Marble Steps; in it were many Chambers, all the floors neatly Pav'd, and furnish'd with Chairs and Stools, Benches, and costly Bedsteds, to accommodate Persons of Quality when they travel'd; with Stable-rooms for an hundred Horse, and Lodgings for twelve hundred Men: Here the Agents choosing one of the most convenient Chambers, took their re|pose that Night.</P>
<P>The second being Munday, about nine a Clock, the Agents with all their Attendance left <HI>Tanwa,</HI> and passing a large Stone Bridge, saw several Ruin'd Towns and Villages, besides others yet in their Splendor, but commanded by Garrisons.</P>
<P>A little before Sun-set, they came to a Fort on the top of a Hill, which whilst they ascended, they were met and courteously welcom'd by the Go|vernor; from whom they understood, that the <HI>Islanders</HI> of <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Que|muy</HI> were upon a Treaty of Peace with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> but he fear'd, that it would come to nothing: This Night they Lodg'd in the Castle, where they had good Entertainment for their Money.</P>
<P>The third, being Tuesday, the Agents set forward about three a Clock in the Morning, and travel'd by and through many Villages, coming at last to a Stone Bridge, at each side Guarded with a Fort.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, the Agents pass'd by several <HI>Pagodes,</HI> where the <HI>Chinesy</HI> Priests seem'd to shew them great Respect, Presenting them with Sweet-Meats and <HI>Tee:</HI> After some stay, proceeding on their Journey, came at last in sight of <HI>Sinksieu,</HI> whither they were sent, not far from whence, they were met by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Come in sight of the Ci|ty <HI>Sinksieu.</HI></NOTE> three <HI>Mandarins</HI> with their Attendants, sent from the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong,</HI> and the General <HI>Lipovi,</HI> to Complement and welcom them.</P>
<P>After the Ceremonies were past on both sides, the Agents were by the <HI>Man|darins</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Are fetched in.</NOTE> carry'd to a great <HI>Pagode,</HI> from whence after a short Treat, they were con|ducted through the City into a spacious Court, the usual place of Reception for their travelling Grandees. This House was of so large Reception, that it not only afforded Stable room for above a thousand Horse, but also Lodgings for as many Men; having divers large and handsom Chambers, furnish'd with stately Bedsteds, Stools and Benches. Here the Agents took their repose, seve|ral Soldiers being sent to Guard the House, from the overpressing intrusions of
<PB N="82" REF="51">
the common People, which by thousands out of curiosity came thither to see and gaze upon the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P>The Agents immediately gave notice of their arrival by their Interpretors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Make their Arrival known, and desire Audience.</NOTE> <HI>Pedel</HI> and <HI>Lakka,</HI> to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong,</HI> and General <HI>Taysing Lipovi,</HI> with request to grant them Audience, and suffer them to speak with him, that they might deliver the General of <HI>Batavia</HI>'s Letters, that so time might not be lost in imploying so stout a Fleet, as lay at present in his own River. Whereupon, the Vice-Roy and General reply'd, That they were come a great and long Voyage by Sea and Land, and were weary with travelling, thefore they should stay till the next day, on which they should have Audience.</P>
<P>Mean while, several <HI>Mandarins</HI> came to Congratulate their welcome, bring|ing with them divers sorts of Fruit, as Oranges, Nuts, Chestnuts, and Pears; besides Hens, Geese, and two Swine, for which they return'd them Thanks, and gave their Servants Money.</P>
<P>The fourth in the Morning, the Agents made themselves ready to deliver<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ride to the Army.</NOTE> the small Presents and Letters from <HI>Batavia,</HI> to the Vice-Roy and General in the Camp. About eight a Clock, twelve Horses were brought to their Lodg|ing, which they and their Attendance Mounted, and with two <HI>Mandarins</HI> Rode thorow a great part of the City <HI>Sinksieu,</HI> by many fair and large Tri|umphal Arches. A little Southward from the City ran a River, which ha|ving cross'd, they came into the Army, which lay about a Mile and a half distant, consisting of sixty thousand Horse and Foot; five grand <HI>Mandarins</HI> attended by a File of Musqueteers, conducted the Agents with great ho|nor to the Secretaries Tent, who hearing of their coming, immediately carry'd them to a great Pavilion, where the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> sate in Council with the General <HI>Taysing Lipovi,</HI> besides two other great Lords, the one being <HI>Santing Hou Bethetok,</HI> and the other <HI>Haitankon,</HI> Governor of <HI>Sinksieu.</HI></P>
<P>The Floors of this Royal Pavilion were Matted; had three publick Gates or Entrances close by one another; thorow the middle most and greatest the Vice-Roy passes only, and his Attendants thorow the other two. Coming close to the Vice-Roy and General, the Agents were order'd to sit down and deliver their Letters, which they did with great Ceremony; the Presents also were presented and deliver'd to the Lords; all which were receiv'd very courte|ously, but they would not accept their Presents, before they had a Warrant for so doing, by an answer from the Emperor at <HI>Peking.</HI> But they kindly ac|cepted of the small Presents which the Admiral <HI>Bort</HI> had sent them; being twelve Pound and two Ounces of Amber-Beads, strung on a Thred, to the number of twenty five; one Amber Hour-Glass, and an Amber Cup.</P>
<P>The Presents from the Lord General and Council of <HI>Batavia,</HI> sent to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Presents for the Vice-Roy.</NOTE> Vice-Roy, were these following:</P>

</LIST>
<P>The Vice-Roy and General falling in Discourse with the Agents, ask'd how long they had been from <HI>Batavia?</HI> Whereupon they answer'd, about seventy days: Then they ask'd, in what time they could come from <HI>Holland</HI> to <HI>China?</HI> Answer was made, in about eight Months; at which they marvel'd exceed|ingly, and likewise at their answer to the question, If there were any Horses, Cows, Hogs, Sheep, Fruit, and Herbage? and they reply'd, By thousands, and more than in <HI>China.</HI> Next they enquir'd, Why they came with such a Fleet on their Coast? Whereto the Agents said, To serve the mighty Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> and to prosecute that great Pyrate <HI>Coxinga,</HI> to do him all the damage they could, both by Sea and Land; because, said they, He without ever giving any no|tice or reasons thereof, came with an Army, in a Warlike Fleet, the last Year in <HI>April,</HI> and set upon the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> in the Islands of <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Tayowan,</HI> and in nine Months time, not only made himself Master of the Countrey, but also took the Castle <HI>Zelandia</HI> from them into his own possessi|on; therefore we seek to unite with the Emperor of <HI>China</HI> his Forces, and make a League with him, to Engage <HI>Coxinga,</HI> both by Sea and Land, till we have Conquer'd and brought him under the subjection of his Imperial Ma|jesty: Whereupon the Vice-Roy and General Reply'd, The <HI>Islanders</HI> of <HI>Que|muy,</HI> and <HI>Eymuy</HI> have already Treated on Peace, and made ready their Ambas|sadors to come to the Court of <HI>Peking,</HI> to obtain the Emperor's Ratification. Being ask'd upon what Articles, they began to smile, and answer'd, they could not tell.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Hollanders</HI> enquir'd, if they knew where their Prisoners were? and if there was no likelihood to get them releas'd? They reply'd, they were in <HI>Quemuy,</HI> and that they would use their best endeavors in a short time to send them to their Ships. Then the Ambassadors propos'd, if they might not take possession of some place on the Main Continent of <HI>China,</HI> or on some Island, for the Harboring their Ships? They answer'd, you are free to choose any good place, either on the Main, or any Island where you please, and to take possession of it; and likewise to put into all Havens, Bays, and Rivers on the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> to take in Water and Firing, buy Provisions, and in bad Wea|ther seek for a safe Harbor. To which purpose We will Command Our Sub|in all Havens, Bays, and Rivers, to aid and assist you, which We doubt not but they will perform.</P>
<P>The Agents asking them to Grant them leave for the disposing those few Merchandize for Money, which were loaden in their Ships, to pay and refresh their Men with. The Vice-Roy and General answer'd, That they had no
<PB N="84" REF="52">
Power, but they must have Order from the Emperor at <HI>Peking;</HI> but had they moved it before, they might perhaps have had Authority to Grant.</P>
<P>After these Discourses ended, every one according to the fashion of the Countrey, was placed by himself at a Table; <HI>viz.</HI> the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong,</HI> the General <HI>Taysang Lipovi,</HI> the Admiral <HI>Santing Houbethetok,</HI> the Governor of <HI>Zwam|sifoe,</HI> the Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Campen, Constantine Nobel,</HI> and <HI>Bodel</HI> the Assistant, beside several <HI>Mandarins.</HI> Their Meat was all brought and set upon the Ta|bles in Golden Chargers; and their Drink fill'd out in Cups of Gold, rare|ly Imboss'd; so that their Entertainment was very splendid. After Din|ner, the Vice-Roy carry'd them through his whole Army, and shew'd them his Forces, making some of his Soldiers to be Exercis'd before them. Towards the Evening, the Agents taking their leave, returning humble thanks for the Honor they had receiv'd, they Mounted their Horses, and Rode towards their Lodgings, where the remainder of the Feast and Banquets which they had left at Dinner was brought after them; and according to the manner of the Countrey, they were visited and Complemented by divers Persons of Quality.</P>
<P>The fifth being Thursday, the Agents prepar'd themselves to deliver their<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Agents go to the General <HI>Lipovi.</HI></NOTE> Excellencies Letters from <HI>Batavia,</HI> to the General <HI>Taysang Lipovi,</HI> with the Let|ter, and small Presents sent to the same Lord, from Admiral <HI>Bort; viz.</HI> One Pound and four Ounces of Amber; one String of fifty five Corals; one Am|ber Hour-Glass; with a tender of the other Presents sent from <HI>Batavia,</HI> which were yet on board.</P>
<P>About eight a Clock, the <HI>Tartars</HI> brought eight Horses to the Agents Quar|ters, with which, they Rode with their Attendants into the Field, about a Ca|non shot from the Vice-Roy, to the General <HI>Lipovi.</HI></P>
<P>Coming into his Presence, the Agents made their Obeisance, delivering the Letter, and were commanded to sit down; with the Letter they also proffer'd him the Presents, which were for the same reasons as the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> gave, refus'd. The Contents of the Letter were thus.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><HI>John Maetzuiker</HI> Governor, and the Council for the <HI>Netherland</HI> States in the Countrey of <HI>India,</HI> send this Letter with our kind Salutation, to <HI>Taisang Lipovi</HI> General, and Deputy Governor of the Territory <HI>Fokien,</HI> for the Great Emperor of <HI>Tartary</HI> and <HI>China.</HI></OPENER>
<P>SO soon as Our Governor of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> had receiv'd Your Highness's Letter, and understood that You would in a short time March with a great Ar|my against <HI>Coxinga,</HI> that all means possible might be us'd thereto; so by Our Order, he prepar'd five Men of War, which he sent to the Bay of <HI>Ingeling,</HI> to Engage with the foremention'd <HI>Coxinga;</HI> but the Ships were by unexpected bad Weather stopt in their Voyage; after which We also had the Misfor|tune, that <HI>Coxinga</HI> after a ten Months Siege took Our Castle of <HI>Tayowan;</HI> but had the Commander of it been a Valiant Soldier, (who is to be sufficiently punish'd for his Cowardise) it could not possibly have fal'n into his Pos|session.</P>
<P>All these Accidents and Misfortunes have occasion'd, that We have not been in a condition to serve you, and satisfie <HI>Singlamong</HI> and Your Highness's Desires: Therefore We entreat You not to take it ill, nor think that We have been wanting in Our Endeavors; for We heartily Declare, joyntly
<PB N="85" REF="52">
with the Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> to seek and use all means to Ruin <HI>Coxinga</HI> and his Party; with this Proviso, that We may put into all Harbors, and drive an unmolested Trade; and also to take a place in possession on the Continent of <HI>China,</HI> without which We should not be able to do <HI>Coxinga</HI> the intended Da|mage: So that We desire Your Highness to be assisting to us in this Business, and We promise if that may be perform'd, to clear the <HI>Chinesy</HI> Seas from that Pirate.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The Letter to the Vice-Roy was written almost after the same manner, <HI>viz.</HI> to Request a Free Trade through the Empire of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>After delivery of the Letters, and Complements from the Lord General and Council, with Wishes of long Life to his Highness <HI>Lipovi,</HI> that he might Tri|umph over his Enemies; they fell into Discourse about business concerning the occasion of their coming thither; as in the Audience the day before, the
<PB N="86" REF="53">
General had understood already: They Requested him that he would be assist|ing to the Vice-Roy, in the releasing of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> in number thirty nine, thirteen Men, six Women, seven Children, and thirteen Slaves and Slavesses) which were said to be Imprison'd on the Islands <HI>Euymuy,</HI> or <HI>Quemuy,</HI> and ex|change them for a <HI>Mandarin,</HI> and his Servants, being of <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Party, and came over with the Agents from <HI>Batavia;</HI> whereupon General <HI>Lipovi</HI> promis'd to do his best Endeavors, and send the releas'd Prisoners aboard.</P>
<P>The General being also ask'd, If the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> might not Sail in and out of the Bays, Havens, and Rivers on the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> to fetch Water and Wood, and buy Provision for their Money, or in time of bad Weather, to come into any Harbor. He answer'd, All Havens, Bays, and Rivers are free|ly open for you, to fetch Water, Wood, and buy Provision; nay, that which is more, said he, We will from this time forward, send to all Harbors, Bays, and Rivers, that are inhabited by the Subjects of this Empire, to aid and assist you in all things; and if you want Money, We will furnish you with it.</P>
<P>Lastly, being ask'd, If his Excellency could not assist the <HI>Netherlands</HI> in the permitting of a free Trade through the Empire: He reply'd, That to promise such a thing was not in his Power, but must be granted by the Emperor at the Court of <HI>Peking;</HI> yet promis'd, that he would write in their behalf about it to the Emperor, if possible, to grant them a free Trade, which was a business that the Merchants in the City <HI>Hoksieu</HI> much Requested and long'd for. But the Ge|neral <HI>Lipovi</HI> wonder'd extreamly, that the Admiral <HI>Bort</HI> should go out of the River <HI>Hoksieu</HI> with twelve Men, leaving only one behind with the Presents, when as, said he, the Admiral <HI>Borts</HI> intentions are not known to the Vice-Roy nor my self; which seem'd very strange to the Agents themselves.</P>
<P>This Discourse ended, they were Treated and Serv'd in Silver Dishes, Plates, and Goblets, Emboss'd after the same manner as at the Vice-Roy's.</P>
<P>Dinner being ended, the Agents desir'd leave to depart, but the General <HI>Lipovi</HI> modestly intreated them to stay, and be Merry a little longer; asking them likewise if they had ought else to impart to him; whereupon they an|swer'd, Nothing but what they had already acquainted his Excellency with, <HI>viz.</HI> the releasing of their Prisoners; On which he made answer, that he would loose no time, but do his best endeavor, and shorly send them aboard.</P>
<P>Then the Agents enquir'd about <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Death; to which the General reply'd, That he had been Deceas'd a considerable time, and that those of the Isles of <HI>Quemuy</HI> and <HI>Eymuy</HI> had Treated with them about a Peace, and were send|ing Ambassadors to <HI>Peking,</HI> to get the Emperor to ratifie it.</P>
<P>Lastly, Seeing their importunity for dispatch, he said, Why are you so hasty in all your Business? every thing must have its time. About eighteen days hence, I am to be at <HI>Hoksiu,</HI> with the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong,</HI> then We will con|sult together with the Governor of <HI>Hoksiu,</HI> if you may sell those Commodities that are in your Ships, which to my judgment may be done by the way of connivance.</P>
<P>The Agents having thus receiv'd answers, rewarding the Servants, took their leaves, and Rode to the Inn, whither all the Meat that was left on their Tables was brought in <HI>Chinesy</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">That is, Baskets.</NOTE> <HI>Suebas.</HI></P>
<P>About the Evening, nineteen Jonks came thither from the Isles of <HI>Quemuy</HI> and <HI>Eymuy,</HI> Laden with Pepper, Cloth, and other Merchandize; wherefore none of the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were permitted to go that day, nor the next out of their Lodgings.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="53">Yet the Agents sent out Ships to enquire what those of the Isles Barter'd their Commodities for, who coming back, inform'd them, that they ex|change Rice and other Commodities; for the Inhabitants on those Isles, want|ed Provision extreamly, because the <HI>Tartars</HI> had Burnt and Ruin'd all the Towns, Villages, and Hamlets, which stood along the Shore, on the Main of <HI>China,</HI> leaving nothing but heaps of Rubbish to testifie their former being.</P>
<P>Neither were any People allow'd to live within three Leagues of the Shore, for those that were found in the foremention'd Limits, were put to Death without Mercy, so to prevent all manner of supply, either of Provisions or Merchandize to go from those or the Main to their Associates, the publick Enemy.</P>
<P>In the Evening came three <HI>Negro</HI>'s, who could speak <HI>Portuguese,</HI> and running away from <HI>Makou,</HI> a Factory of <HI>Portugal,</HI> were now in service amongst the <HI>Tar|tar</HI> Horse; these entring the Agents Lodgings, fell upon the <HI>Hollanders</HI> with re|proachful Language.</P>
<P>The seventh being <HI>Saturday,</HI> the Agents Rode in the Morning with their<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Agents address them|selves to the Vice-Roy, and General in the Army.</NOTE> Attendants to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong,</HI> and General <HI>Lipovi</HI> into the Army, with Request to both, That they would be pleas'd to Sign what they had in words promis'd them, that they might give it to their Masters, the Lord Ge|neral, and the Lords of the <HI>Indian</HI> Council, and to the Admiral <HI>Bort, viz.</HI> that they promis'd to do their best endeavors, if it were possible, to send the Pri|soners aboard the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Ships; and secondly, that they may put into all Harbors, Havens, and Rivers, on the Coast of <HI>China</HI> with their Ships, and to Sail to and from all Islands, to get Water, Firing, and Provisions for Money, for their Sea-men; and in bad Weather, choose any good Harbor to secure their Vessels in. Thirdly, That those Goods which were in their Ships, might be privately sold in <HI>Hoksieu;</HI> whereto the Vice-Roy answer'd about eighteen or twenty days since, (as I said before) I am to be in <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> then I will con|sult with the Governor, if you may sell those Goods there, which you have brought in your Ships, which I no ways doubt.</P>
<P>But as to what concerns the Journey of your Forces with ours, to Ruine <HI>Coxinga</HI> and his Party, there is no more to be said of it, for those of the Isles are now Treating with us concerning a Peace, so that the Admiral must be si|lent therein; yet if he should chance to meet with any of their Jonks, or Ves|sels at Sea, or in Harbors, Havens or Rivers, he may take and carry them away; nevertheless, it would be better to let them pass, rather than to disturb the Coast of <HI>China</HI> with such sudden Alarms.</P>
<P>Then the Agents made a complaint to the Vice-Roy, and General of the three <HI>Negro</HI>'s, that abus'd them the other Night; whereupon they were im|mediately brought, and severely punish'd before them.</P>
<P>Lastly, The Vice-Roy desir'd the Ambassadors, that their followers would stay and be merry with them, and shew some skill in their way of Dancing, but they making excuses for them, and taking their leave, went to <HI>Sinksieu.</HI></P>
<P>The eighth being <HI>Sunday,</HI> in the Morning, the <HI>Chinesy</HI> Interpreter <HI>Lakka,</HI> with the two <HI>Hoksiean Mandarins</HI> (belonging to the Vice-Roy's Mother) were sent to the Vice-Roy in the Army, to request, that the Agents might return to <HI>Hoksieu.</HI></P>
<P>After some stay, the Vice-Roy sent some of his Servants with fifteen Hor|ses Sadled and very richly furnish'd to their Lodgings, to carry them thorow the City to the Army.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="54">Having therefore made ready some small Presents, they mounted, and rode directly to the Army, addressing themselves in an humble manner to the Ge|neral, and the rest of the Captains, giving them thanks for the Honor they had receiv'd. Hereupon, according to order, the Interpreter <HI>Lakka</HI> appearing, prof|fer'd the Vice-Roy, in the Vice-Admiral <HI>Iohn van Campen</HI>'s Name, a great Case with fifteen Flasks of Brandy, sixteen Rummers, sixteen Beer-glasses, six hand|som Knives, with a Bever Hat.</P>
<P>The General <HI>Taising Lipovi</HI> receiv'd from the Hands of the same Interpreter, in the Admirals Name, a Bever Hat, a pair of Pistols and Holsters, eight Flasks of Brandy, eight with <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine, three Knives, three Rummers, and three Beer-glasses.</P>
<P>The Presents given to <HI>Haitangkong,</HI> Governor of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> was a Castor, six <HI>Dutch</HI> Knives, three Rummers, three Beer-glasses, six Flasks with <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine, and six with Brandy.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Santing Houbethetok,</HI> Admiral of the Sea, and Governor of the City <HI>Zwansifoe,</HI> was also presented with a Castor, five Flasks of <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine, and five of Brandy, three Rummers, three Beer-glasses, and five <HI>Dutch</HI> Knives; all which, though of a small value, were accepted with extraordinary kind|ness.</P>
<P>After this, the Agents had a long Discourse with these four Great Ministers, who promis'd to assist them in all that lay within their Power, alledging, as a proof thereof, That they had already sent their Generals Letter to the Empe|ror, and written in their behalf; so that they did not doubt to get them Li|cence for a Free Trade through the whole Empire: But at last the Vice-Roy added,</P>
<Q><P> You <HI>Hollanders</HI> must not be too hasty; for We are not to be forc'd<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vice-Roy's Discourse to the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></NOTE> to grant any thing to you; much less can We joyn our Forces, and make a League with you, against the grand Pyrate <HI>Coxinga,</HI> both by Sea and Land, before We have Order from the Emperor at his Court in <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>We have (continu'd he) Power to perform what We have promis'd you; As, Freedom to put into all Havens, Bays, and Rivers lying on the main Coast of <HI>China</HI> and the adjacent Isles, to fetch Water, Wood, and buy Provision, and furnish your selves with other Necessaries; nay, We will accommodate you with it upon a free Accompt: Nay more, you have full Licence to take a convenient place in possession, which is pro|vided of a good Harbor, either on the main Coast of <HI>China,</HI> or on one of the Islands in the River <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> or on one of these Places, <HI>Tenhai, Sotiha, Kitat,</HI> or <HI>Onkia,</HI> every one of which have large and safe Havens for the accommodati|on of many Ships.</P>
<P>As to what concerns your Prisoners, We will speedily send away Letters to the Governors of the Islands <HI>Quemuy</HI> and <HI>Eymuy,</HI> to inquire if they be there? If so, We promise to procure their Liberty, and send them aboard your Ships.</P></Q>
<P>Lastly, The Vice-Roy and General caus'd the Interpreter <HI>Lakka</HI> to tell them, <Q>That if they would stay four or five days in <HI>Sinksieu,</HI> they should have an Answer of their Letters from the Governors of the Islands, and so hear if the Prisoners be there, or not: But if they would depart, they must tarry six|teen or seventeen days in <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> for the Vice-Roy and Generals coming thither, because they were desirous to see their Forces and Fleet; mean while they would consult with the Provincials of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and then give their Resolution by the Governor, Whether the several <HI>Cargoes</HI> which they
<PB N="89" REF="54">
had in their Ships might not be sold in private.</Q> Likewise the Interpreter be|ing so commanded, further told them, <Q>That it had been better that their Ad|miral had staid in the River <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and not gone to Sea, because he would effect little by so doing; for along the Sea-Coast we have nothing but ru|in'd Cities and Villages, where some poor Fishermen, with their Vessels and Nets, with leave of the Governors, live to maintain themselves, because all the greatest Towns and Villages in those Parts were by the Emperors Order pull'd down to the Ground, to prevent the sending of Provisions and Merchandise to the Islands <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> by which means <HI>Coxinga</HI> and his great Forces being much straightned, he betook himself, with all his Ar|my and Jonks, to <HI>Formosa,</HI> and not onely won that, but <HI>Tayowan</HI> also, leaving onely some small Garrisons of Soldiers on those Isles; yet if by the Treaty now on Foot a Peace be concluded, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> may easily obtain it of us again.</Q></P>
<P>Hereupon the Vice-Admiral <HI>Campen</HI> directed the Interpreter to tell the Vice-Roy, <Q>That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> hoped, that now would have been the onely time to enter into a League with the Great <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> and Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> that joyning their Forces, they might reduce all under the Subjection of his Imperial Majesty.</Q></P>
<P>Whereupon the Vice-Roy return'd, <Q>That is done already, and needs no more to be spoken of: We are now at a Cessation of Arms with the Gover|nors of the Islands; but if the Emperor hath or will accept of the Peace, We know not; yet it hath proceeded thus far, that young <HI>Coxinga</HI> and all his People will obey, and submit themselves to the Emperor, by shaving off their Hair, except one Tuft, and also become Tributaries; onely they de|mand a peculiar Government, and Garrisons for their own Soldiers; which whether the Emperor will grant, is much to be doubted: However, you must stay sixty or seventy days for an Answer from the Emperor at <HI>Peking, viz.</HI> If you shall have a Free Trade granted through all <HI>China?</HI> Which We suppose may be done.</Q></P>
<P>But <HI>Van Campen</HI> order'd the Interpreter <HI>Lakka</HI> to tell the Vice-Roy and Ge|neral, <Q>That in <HI>Peking</HI> were many subtile Jesuits and Priests, who bore great spleen to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and sought to scandalize and make them seem odious to the Emperor, because of their difference in Religion among themselves, and likewise for the War maintain'd by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> against the two Mighty Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> to whom these Jesuits and Priests were Confessors.</Q></P>
<P>The Vice-Roy and General made answer, <Q>That for the same Reason must the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who under their Emperor the <HI>Great Cham of Tartary,</HI> have by force of Arms subdu'd and taken the whole Empire of <HI>China,</HI> be accounted a despicable People by the Jesuits, because they had done the same thing with the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> adding, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were the welcomer to them in <HI>China,</HI> and that they would look to the Priests and Jesuits somewhat better than they had done heretofore.</Q> Thus ended the Discourse.</P>
<P>Then the Vice-Roy and General, in the presence of many great <HI>Mandarins,</HI> entertain'd the Agents and their Retinue, who sate every one at a particular Table, furnish'd with variety of Meat, serv'd in Gold and Silver Dishes, and being very merry, drunk the Emperors, and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> General <HI>Iohn Maet|zuiker</HI>'s Health.</P>
<P>Then the Vice-Roy presented each of them with two Pieces of Silk Stuffs,
<PB N="90" REF="55">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
and a Silver Plate, whereon their Names were engraven in Characters or Let|ters<NOTE PLACE="marg">Silver Plates given by the Vice-Roy to the Agents&punc;</NOTE> of Gold: These Plates serv'd them as a Pass, with which they might, without danger, travel through all the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> and every where be acknowledg'd as <HI>Lavyaes,</HI> that is, <HI>Lords.</HI></P>
<P>The General likewise gave them each two Pieces of <HI>Chinese</HI> Silk Stuffs, and one Silver Plate; for which the Agents humbly return'd them both thanks, and likewise for the Honor and Favor which they had been pleas'd to shew them.</P>
<P>The Plate given by the General to <HI>Van Campen</HI> was the biggest and thickest, weighing above twenty Ounces, and eight or nine Inches in Diameter: The undermost or greatest part is quite round, and neatly imprest in the middle with six gilded <HI>Chinese</HI> Letters; the Edges about it embost with Flowers, and gilt. On the top, for an Ornament, was like a Handle, a piece Scallop'd, the Edges gilt, and the middle wrought with Leaves and Flowers.</P>
<P>The other Plate, being the Vice-Roys, was much lighter, weighing not above six Ounces, very thin, and no way so well gilded or flowr'd at the Edges, but onely on the Handle, having in the middle sixteen or seventeen <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters.</P>
<P>Besides these, every one of the Attendants had a Silver Cognizance given them; but much lesser and lighter than the other.</P>
<P>Upon the <HI>Hollanders</HI> first arrival, the Vice-Roy sent a Letter to the Empe|ror, informing him of their Intention; and likewise another to the Admiral <HI>Bort,</HI> whom he desir'd to stay for his coming, because he was very desirous to see their Fleet, and to that end, for encouragement, proffer'd to furnish them with Provisions at his own Charge: But <HI>Bort</HI> being gone with the Fleet to|wards the North, before the Vice-Roys Letter came to his Hands, and the Vice Roy coming afterwards in vain, it was resented very ill; yet at last he seem'd pacified, when told, That it hapned through the mistake of not deli|vering the Letters in good time.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="55">And now the Ambassadors having leave to return, took their Farewel with many Ceremonies, complemented by the Vice-Roy and General after the manner of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> then wishing them a safe Return, they commanded seven <HI>Mandarins</HI> to conduct them through the Army, beyond all the Guards: From whence they rode over a great Bridge, into the City, to their Lodgings.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Sinksieu,</HI> lying eleven days Journey into the Countrey, is cut<NOTE PLACE="marg">City <HI>Sinksieu.</HI></NOTE> through the middle by a River, which takes its Original out of a Mountain, about an Hours walk beyond the Fort <HI>Lantyn:</HI> It stands inviron'd with a Stone Wall, broad enough for a Cart and Horses to go upon, and set full of long Poles, pointed with a sharp Iron like a Scythe, with which they can cut a Man asunder at one stroke.</P>
<P>The City hath handsom Streets&punc; pav'd with Free-stone, high Buildings, large <HI>Pagodes</HI> or Temples of blue Stone, several Houses and Shops well furnish'd with all manner of Silks, Pourcelan, Linnen, and other necessary Commodities.</P>
<P>All the Windows of the Houses were fill'd with Spectators, and the Streets on both sides crowded with thousands of People, who out of curiosity came to see the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> many of whom, as they pass'd by, wish'd them all happi|ness, and a prosperous Journey.</P>
<P>Being past through the City with all their Train, which consisted in seven|teen <HI>Hollanders,</HI> about a hundred to carry their Baggage, and fifty Horse and Foot, sent by the Vice-Roy as their Guard and Convoy, they rode in four days to <HI>Zwansifoe,</HI> from whence in the Evening they came to a great Village nam'd <HI>Chinhoe,</HI> where they were welcom'd by three <HI>Mandarins,</HI> and conducted into a spacious <HI>Pagode,</HI> wherein the Images sate on Stools and Tables, being there kindly entertain'd and treated by the Priests.</P>
<P>The ninth the Ambassadors set forth very early out of <HI>Chinhoe,</HI> and travel|ling all day, at night arriv'd at a strong Hold, where they intended to take up their Lodging for that night; but they were carried into a <HI>Mandarins</HI> House, and accommodated very generously, where amongst others they saw three La|dies, one of whose Feet (with Shoes and all) were but six, another five and a half, and the third five Inches long, occasion'd from the straight swadling of their Legs and Feet in their Infancy, after the <HI>Chinese</HI> manner; for Women with great Feet they account homely, and those that have little Feet, Beauties; so that the bigger they are, the lesser they strive to make their Feet.</P>
<P>The tenth setting forward again, they travell'd by several ruin'd Villages; They saw also nine strong Castles, and many long&punc;hair'd <HI>Chineses</HI> Heads, hanging in Baskets on Trees; for all the <HI>Chineses</HI> of <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Party, which re|fus'd to cut their Hair, were (when found) by the Emperors Command de|collated, and their Heads hang'd up in that manner.</P>
<P>In the Evening they came to the City <HI>Tamwa,</HI> where they were receiv'd by<NOTE PLACE="marg">City <HI>Tamwa.</HI></NOTE> three <HI>Mandarins,</HI> conducted to a great House like a Court of Guard, and enter|tain'd with variety of Meats.</P>
<P>The Eleventh in the Morning they left <HI>Tamwa,</HI> and proceeding on their Journey, went through several other Villages and Fortifications; in the af|ternoon coming to the Castle <HI>Tamhoe,</HI> they retir'd thither to rest themselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fort <HI>Tamhoe.</HI></NOTE> because <HI>Constantine Nobel</HI> was much troubled with an Ague, where the Governor entertaining them with variety of Dishes, they made by several Presents a ci|vil Return.</P>
<P>The twelfth they left <HI>Tamhoe,</HI> and travell'd that day by five great Villages, and many Garrisons, and at Noon arriv'd at the City <HI>Zwansifoe,</HI> where met by<NOTE PLACE="marg">City <HI>Zwansifoe.</HI></NOTE>
<PB N="92" REF="56">
the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> and conducted into an antient Building: After a little stay, they pass'd on to <HI>Santing Houbethetok</HI> his House, a Man of great Quality, and Go|vernor of this City, whom they proffer'd the Presents sent him by the Admi|ral <HI>Bort, viz.</HI> A pair of Pistols, five <HI>Dutch</HI> Ells of Scarlet, and four Pieces of fine Linnen; but because they seem'd to <HI>Van Campen</HI> and <HI>Nobel</HI> too little, they added a Demy-castor, five <HI>Dutch</HI> Knives, three Rummers, three Beer-glasses, five Flasks of Brandy, and five of Sack; all which <HI>Santing Houbethetok</HI> re|ceiv'd, and caus'd to be brought to him by his Servants; and having treated the Ambassadors very splendidly, gave each of them two <HI>Chinese</HI> Rolls of Silk, and a great Silver Medal, whereon with Golden Letters his Name was engra|ven, which was a Pasport, signifying, That whoever bore it were Persons of Quality, and so to be look'd upon as no less than <HI>Lavyaes,</HI> that is, <HI>Lords,</HI> or <HI>Fa|thers.</HI> This done, they began a long Discourse about the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Chinese</HI> Wars, and also that of <HI>Coxinga.</HI> Lastly, they desir'd his Assistance in the pro|curing for them a Free Trade in <HI>China;</HI> of which he seem'd no ways to doubt, saying, <HI>Were your Ships here hard by, or in the River, I would buy all your Commodities.</HI> Having discours'd a little while, and been plentifully feasted, they took their leaves, and rode to their Lodging, where divers <HI>Mandarins,</HI> out of curiosity, came to visit and speak with them, and bringing Fruit and Sweet-meats, kept them company most part of the Night.</P>
<P>The thirteenth at day-break the Agents left <HI>Zwansifoe,</HI> and travell'd until they reach'd <HI>Zwansehoo,</HI> a Place of very considerable strength, into which they<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fort <HI>Zwansehoo.</HI></NOTE> were receiv'd by three <HI>Mandarins,</HI> who gave them a very handsom Entertain|ment.</P>
<P>The fourteenth, being <HI>Saturday,</HI> they left <HI>Zwansehoo,</HI> and going on all day, came towards Evening to a well-guarded Place call'd <HI>Enwacho,</HI> where they took their Repose that Night in a Temple, in which they were nobly accom|modated by the Priests.</P>
<P>On <HI>Munday</HI> Morning, the sixteenth, the Agents set forward again, and that night reach'd the City <HI>Enwa,</HI> into which being conducted by three great <HI>Man|darins,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">City <HI>Enwa.</HI></NOTE> they were brought into a great Wall'd <HI>Pagode,</HI> wherein above fifty <HI>Chi|nese</HI> Priests having their abode, gave them a welcome Reception.</P>
<P>Many Apartments were in this <HI>Pagode,</HI> every one furnish'd with various Images, which being as big as the Life, sate cloth'd in rich Apparel, on Stools, round about Tables: All the Priests offer'd Incense to these their Idols, before whom also burnt many Lamps, with taboring on a Drum, and singing.</P>
<P>The next day the Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Campen</HI> presented the Priests with twen|ty Crowns of Silver Coin, for which they return'd him many complemental Thanks, after the <HI>Chinese</HI> manner.</P>
<P>The same day proceeding further on, they pass'd a most delightful and rich Countrey, which had not been wasted by the War, but remain'd still in its full Glory: Here they saw divers well-built and wall'd Villages, and likewise many antient Structures, and beautiful Tombs, each of which had a conveni|ent Entrance, and within that an arched Passage leading to the Grave, where they burnt Offerings to the Dead. There were also Tombs on which lay great Turtles carv'd of blue Stone, and others adorn'd with Columns, and arch'd above.</P>
<P>In the Evening they arriv'd at Fort <HI>Lantongzwa,</HI> standing on Mount <HI>Tishoo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fort <HI>Lantongzwa.</HI></NOTE> into which they were introduc'd by three <HI>Mandarins,</HI> and conducted to the Go|vernors House, who entertain'd them nobly, and had a long Discourse about the <HI>Dutch, Tartar,</HI> and <HI>Chinese</HI> War.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="56">
<FIGURE>

<P>The eighteenth they began their Journey about Noon, not able sooner to get Men to carry them and their Goods, and travell'd towards the Evening through a great unwall'd Village, where they were invited to a civil Treat by a grand <HI>Mandarin.</HI></P>
<P>Here the Agents found five <HI>Chineses,</HI> which a few days before were fled with a Jonk from <HI>Tayowan,</HI> amongst which was one who smatter'd so much broken <HI>Dutch,</HI> that <HI>Van Campen</HI> could understand when he told him, That <HI>Coxinga,</HI> and the General <HI>Bethekok,</HI> two such Leaders that <HI>China</HI> afforded not the like, being overpower'd and straightned by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> both despairing, ended their days in <HI>Tayowan,</HI> where since hapned such a Famine, that many died, suffering by extremity of want.</P>
<P>At the Evening arriving at the City <HI>Hokzwa,</HI> three <HI>Mandarins</HI> led them to a spacious House, whereto all Governors, when they travel about Publick Af|fairs, are conducted; for these Houses, as we said before, have many large Chambers&punc; furnish'd with good Beds, and all manner of Furniture, both for their Lodging and Diet, with large Out-rooms for Servants, and Stables for Horses. The Governor of the Town sent the Agents good store of fresh Provisions. After Supper many Grandees of the City, and two <HI>Mandarins</HI> that came lately from <HI>Peking,</HI> visited them, who told them, that all the News there was, that the Peace between the Emperor and <HI>Coxinga</HI> would not be con|cluded, because the Islanders of <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy</HI> would have their own Go|vernors and Soldiers. They also acquainted them of the sudden Death of <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Envoy in his Journey to <HI>Peking,</HI> and that there was no News of send|ing another in his stead.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday,</HI> being the nineteenth, a great Train of People rode through the City, that came from <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and were going to <HI>Sinksieu,</HI> to the Vice-Roy, with Clothes and other Goods, and also with News of his Wives Mothers Death, which forc'd the Agents to stay for Men to carry their Necessaries. Mean while the Vice-Admiral <HI>Campen</HI> went to view the City, and walking
<PB N="94" REF="57">
along, met with a Slave that was run away from <HI>Macaw,</HI> and serv'd now in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Army as a Soldier, who leading him out of the City, shew'd him a <HI>Christian</HI> Temple, where, according to the Slaves Relation, Father <HI>Martinius,</HI> famous for his Writing of the <HI>Chinese Atlas,</HI> and other remarkable Antiquities of that People, died thirty seven days before.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1653. this <HI>Martinius</HI> came with a <HI>Portuguese</HI> Frigat from <HI>Macasser</HI> to <HI>Ba|tavia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Martinius</HI> Hist. of <HI>Chi|na,</HI> publish'd in 1653.</NOTE> after having been ten or twelve Years in the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> where he preach'd the Gospel, and converted, as they say, above two thousand Souls, and went the same Year from <HI>Batavia</HI> in the good Ship the <HI>White Elephant,</HI> com|manded by the foremention'd <HI>Iohn Van Campen,</HI> to <HI>Holland;</HI> but the Ship run|ning into <HI>Bergen</HI> in <HI>Norway, Martinius</HI> travell'd from thence through the <HI>Sound</HI> to <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> where he publish'd the foremention'd Works.</P>
<P>At Noon leaving <HI>Hokzwa,</HI> and proceeding on their Journey, in the Evening<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leave <HI>Hokzwa&punc;</HI></NOTE> they enter'd a Village, and according to custom went into a great <HI>Pagode,</HI> where they were courteously entertain'd by the Priests, and took repose that Night.</P>
<P>On <HI>Friday</HI> Morning, being the twentieth, setting out very early, they rode through a Village abont an <HI>English</HI> Mile and a half long, which the Night be|fore was the greater part burnt down by Thieves, and in the Fire about a hun|dred Men, Women, and Children consum'd to Ashes, or otherwise murther'd.</P>
<P>About Noon having pass'd the Village, they were brought to a great House where the <HI>Chineses</HI> kept Watch. Here was but one <HI>Mandarin,</HI> who receiv'd the Agents very friendly, and seem'd heartily to rejoyce that they had not shared in the last nights Calamity. In the afternoon they took their leave, and went, being guided by the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> to the Shore of an In-land River, where they and their Retinue Embarqu'd themselves in a Vessel that lay ready for to carry them to <HI>Hoksieu.</HI> Towards Night they came to <HI>Lavyit,</HI> or <HI>Anlavja,</HI> a Strong|hold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fort <HI>Anlavja.</HI></NOTE> built on the top of a Mountain: Near which was a Ferry for the ease of Travellers.</P>
<P>The one and twentieth, being <HI>Saturday,</HI> in the Morning they came to <HI>Lamthay,</HI> belonging to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> where they were kindly receiv'd by divers <HI>Mandarins,</HI> and the Governor of the City <HI>Engeling,</HI> who nobly entertain'd them. After Dinner they were conducted through the City, and shew'd may antient Edifices, and spacious <HI>Pagodes,</HI> or Temples. At Night they return'd to their Vessel, not|withstanding the Governor of <HI>Minjazen</HI> proffer'd them his House for their Lodgings.</P>
<P>The two and twentieth they sent the <HI>Chinese</HI> Interpreter <HI>Lakka,</HI> with two <HI>Mandarins,</HI> to the City <HI>Hoksieu</HI> before them, and prepared themselves with some Presents of Scarlet, Crown-Serge, and Bays, to give to <HI>Han|lavja</HI> the Governor of <HI>Minjazen,</HI> and likewise to the Ruler of <HI>Hoksieu:</HI> who hearing of their arrival by the Interpreter <HI>Lakka,</HI> sent them fifteen Saddle-Horses: But <HI>Van Campen</HI> not being very well dispos'd, staid in the Barque, ordering <HI>Constantine Nobel</HI> to take the Presents, and ride with all their Atten|dants to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> where after a kind Reception, towards Evening he return'd to <HI>Lamthay,</HI> to the Vessel.</P>
<P>The next day, being the twenty third, the <HI>Mandarin</HI> of <HI>Lamthay</HI> invited the Agents to Dinner, which they would willingly have put off; but fearing his Displeasure, they granted his Request. Many great <HI>Mandarins,</HI> besides the Go|vernors of <HI>Minjazen</HI> and <HI>Engeling,</HI> were present at this Feast, which was ended to the general satisfaction of all, with great jollity and good cheer. The <HI>Chi|nese</HI>
<PB N="95" REF="57">
Lords advis'd the Agents to stay seven or eight days longer, to congratu|late the Vice-Roys Return, and for the farther accomplishing their Business; promising them their Assistance in their Request, for selling those Merchan|dizes that were in the Ships.</P>
<P>The twenty fourth, being <HI>Tuesday,</HI> in the morning <HI>Van Campen</HI> and <HI>Nobel</HI> rode both to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> to complement the Governor and other <HI>Mandarins,</HI> and likewise to present them with five Ells of Scarlet, a piece of Crown Serge, and a Demy-Castor; which the foresaid Lords receiv'd very courteously, pro|mising to be assistant to the Agents in the procuring a Free Trade for them, provided they were not too hasty.</P>
<P>About Sun-set the Agents took their leave, and mounting their Horses, rode through a great Throng of People out of the City, and came at Night to their Vessel, lying at <HI>Lamthay,</HI> where they took their Repose.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Changcheu,</HI> hath many stately Buildings of blue Stone, and several great <HI>Pagodes</HI> or Temples; being inviron'd with a high Wall, fortified with Bulwarks and deep Ditches, and the Streets well pav'd.</P>
<P>The twenty fifth the Governor of the Fort <HI>Engeling,</HI> accompanied with se|veral very eminent <HI>Mandarins,</HI> came to visit the Agents in their Jonk, where they were welcom'd by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> with <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Rhenish</HI> Wine, which having drunk, they spent some time in discoursing about the War.</P>
<P>This Fort of <HI>Engeling</HI> stands on the Sea-shore, before which is a safe Harbor for Ships: Near the Bay stood formerly a great Town of Trade of the same Name, but was quite ruin'd and raz'd by the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>But during the <HI>Mandarins&punc;</HI> and Agents Discourse together in their Jonk, came a <HI>Tartar,</HI> a Soldier of <HI>Hanlavia,</HI> with a Letter from the Admiral <HI>Bort,</HI> to the Agents <HI>Iohn Van Campen,</HI> and <HI>Constantine Nobel:</HI> The Contents thereof to this purpose.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THis Morning I have understood of your coming back to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> from Our Secretary <HI>Iohn Melman,</HI> sent from Us to the River of <HI>Hoksieu</HI> to inquire for you, and deliver a Letter to the Governor of <HI>Minjazen.</HI> Since that being inform'd, as likewise by your Letter written in haste, That the <HI>Tartars</HI> have concluded Peace with those of <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> from whence We may suppose that they will begin nothing with Us to their prejudice, but rather prevent it (if they have but any opportunity) and to make Satisfacti|on for all Damages (because with this Peace they are become their Subjects) done already, and which hereafter we may do them: To prevent all, We wish that We had the <HI>Domburgh</HI> Frigat here with us.</P>
<P>Yet nevertheless, We give no such Order by these Presents, that by such sudden alterations we may create no suspitious thoughts in them: But We do hereby send you Our good Sailer the <HI>Sea-dog</HI> Frigat, that upon the receit hereof you may come to us. This we desire you to observe, that We may hear your Adventures, and what you have effected in your Business, that then We may consult and resolve one with another, what is best to be done in this Affair, for the Benefit of the Publick, and prejudice to the Enemy.</P>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="96" REF="58">The Governor of <HI>Engeling,</HI> with the <HI>Mandarin</HI> of the Fort, at the Agents Re|quest, provided instantly thirteen Saddle-Horses, whereon they rode to <HI>Hok|sieu,</HI> to obtain Licence to return to their Ships; whither they came about Noon, and went to the Governor and <HI>Mandarins,</HI> of whom they desir'd leave to depart to their Fleet; whereto the Governor reply'd, <HI>Why so hasty, when you are still weary of your Iourney? It is better for you to stay till the Vice-Roy</HI> Singlamong <HI>and General</HI> Lipovi <HI>come hither: Your Business hath a good face, and We have writ to the Emperor, at his Court in</HI> Peking, <HI>on your behalf; and in all likelihood We shall have an Answer back in fifty or sixty days; and in nine or ten days, at farthest, the Vice-Roy and General will be here: It will be requisite that you stay so long, and be present to fetch in the Vice-Roy, which he will take as a great Kindness: Mean while you may come daily to visit the</HI> Mandarins, <HI>which will much promote your Desires. We do certainly believe, That the liberty of a Free Trade will be permitted you, and likewise to dispose of all those Goods in your Ships.</HI> Whereupon the Agents return'd their humble and hearty Thanks, but told them by their Interpreter <HI>Lakka, That their Admiral had writ to them to make what haste they could to the Fleet, which lay near the Cape of</HI> Tinghay. Whereupon the Governor made Answer, <HI>Will they go? Let them do what they please: But first we will eat.</HI> Upon which, Meat being brought, every one was set at a distinct Table, according to the fashion of the Countrey, and serv'd in Gold and Silver Chargers. Dinner being past, they had a long Discourse concerning the <HI>Chinese</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> War; which ended, the Agents took their leaves; then mounting, they rode through the City, and came at last to <HI>Lam|thay</HI> to their Barque, where having given the Governor and <HI>Mandarin</HI> of the Fort a Visit, they went aboard their Jonk.</P>
<P>The twenty sixth, being <HI>Thursday,</HI> the grand <HI>Mandarin, Hanlavia,</HI> Governor<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Agents Treatment with <HI>Hanlavia.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Minjazen,</HI> came in the Morning to the River side, and fetching the Agents with great Ceremony out of the Jonk, invited them to a Treatment: They fearing to incur his displeasure if they refus'd, accepted of his kindness, where they were courteously welcom'd, and saluted by the Servants with loud Accla|mations, crying out, <HI>Fueet,</HI> that is, <HI>Long live;</HI> a peculiar Ceremony of great Honor in this Empire, and us'd by none but Persons of great Quality, which generally command their Servants to do it. The Feast ended, they began a long Discourse about the War in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> which last continu'd twen|ty Years, in which <HI>Hanlavia</HI> always perform'd great Service for the <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary,</HI> and was a main Assistant in his Conquests.</P>
<P>He also told them, <HI>That he prepar'd himself to bring that grand Pyrate</HI> Coxinga <HI>under the Emperors Subjection; to which purpose</HI> (said he) <HI>I am by the Emperors Order sent towards the Sea, not seeing any hopes at all of a Peace between the</HI> Cham <HI>and</HI> Cox|inga, <HI>who by Ambassadors sent to the Emperor in</HI> Peking <HI>much desires it. I also under|stand, That the</HI> Hollanders <HI>coming into the River</HI> Hoksieu, <HI>is very acceptable to the Great</HI> Cham; <HI>so that to obtain liberty for a Free Trade for you through all</HI> China, <HI>is not to be doubted: Why then</HI> (proceeded he) <HI>are you so hasly to be gone? You ought rather to have stay'd in the River</HI> Hoksieu, <HI>till the Vice-Roy and General</HI> Lipovi <HI>were come, since the Peace with</HI> Coxinga <HI>will come to no effect.</HI></P>
<P>This Discourse and their Entertainment being ended, the Agents took their leave of the Governor <HI>Hanlavia,</HI> and other eminent <HI>Mandarins,</HI> who, according to the manner, wish'd them a Boon Voyage.</P>
<P>Whilst they were sitting at Table, they heard the Word <HI>Fueet</HI> several times repeated, whereat some of their Attendance bow'd, and others fell flat on the Ground.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="58">The <HI>Tartars</HI> being ask'd if the Word <HI>Fueet</HI> signified <HI>Holy,</HI> they answer'd, <HI>No, but it was a Word of Ceremony, by which they partly express'd how their Servants obey'd them, and partly how welcom their Guests were.</HI></P>
<P>The Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Campen</HI> having gratified the Servants for their Atten|dance, went immediately with his Jonk aboard the <HI>Sea-hound</HI> Frigat, Com|manded by <HI>Iohn Hendrikson,</HI> who the next day, being the twenty seventh, weigh'd Anchor, and fell down with the Ebb to the Mouth of the River, that so he might with the first fair Wind sail to the other Ships at <HI>Tinghay,</HI> where he arriv'd the following day in the Evening, when the Vice-Admiral and <HI>Nobel</HI> caus'd themselves immediately to be put aboard the Admiral, in the <HI>Naerden</HI> Frigat, there to give him an account of their Affairs and several Adventures, and especially deliver him the Letters sent him from the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> and General <HI>Lipovi;</HI> the Contents of which consisted most in the Pro|mises already mention'd by the same Lords to <HI>Van Campen</HI> and <HI>Nobel,</HI> of their kind proffer of Friendship, License to put into all Bays, Havens, and Rivers on the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> with their Ships, either in foul Weather, or otherwise; and likewise to take Water and Wood, and buy Provision for their Sea-men.</P>
<P>The thirtieth, about Noon, <HI>Constantine Nobel</HI> was sent with the <HI>Sea-hound</HI> Frigat, and <HI>Ter-Boede</HI> Pink, from the Fleet to the River <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> there to pro|mote the Business, and strictly to observe all Passages.</P>
<P>The one and thirtieth the Vice&punc; Admiral, though surpris'd with a Pestilen|tial Fever, and great Sickness, was commanded to Sail about the East with six Ships.</P>
<P>The second of <HI>November,</HI> being <HI>Thursday,</HI> the <HI>Finch</HI> went from <HI>Tinghay</HI> to the River <HI>Hoksieu.</HI></P>
<P>The third, by the Admirals Order, two hundred Soldiers were put ashore to drive the <HI>Chineses</HI> out of <HI>Tinghay</HI> into the Mountains; but finding them in a good posture of defence, they retreated without effecting any thing.</P>
<P>The fourth the <HI>Sea-hound</HI> Frigat came again from the River <HI>Hoksieu</HI> to the Fleet at <HI>Tinghay,</HI> as also the <HI>Finch</HI> the next day; and then all the Ships took in Wood.</P>
<P>The sixth the <HI>Breukelen</HI> Pink set Sail for <HI>Batavia,</HI> with the Goods that had been taken at Sea, and Letters of Advice concerning the Agents Adventures at <HI>Sinksieu,</HI> being convey'd beyond the Islands by the <HI>Sea-hound</HI> Frigat, and <HI>Ter-Boede</HI> Pink, who on the next day came again to an Anchor with the rest of the Fleet near <HI>Tinghay.</HI></P>
<P>The eighth in the Morning <HI>Van Campen</HI> put to Sea with the <HI>Zierikzee, Ankee|veen,</HI> and <HI>Loenen</HI> Frigats, to Cruise Northerly; but being hindred by a Storm and contrary Tides, came to an Anchor again about Noon in ten Fathom Water.</P>
<P><HI>Fryday,</HI> the tenth, the Vice-Admiral weigh'd Anchor again, to steer Nor|therly, but came back without any effect; yet soon after they spied fifteen or sixteen <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonks in the South-West, at a great distance, to chase which, they presently sent the <HI>Sea-hound</HI> and <HI>Calf</HI> Frigats, with the <HI>Zierikzees</HI> Boat, and those of the <HI>Ankeveen,</HI> full of armed Men; but the <HI>Chineses</HI> escap'd by their nimble Sailing, onely one <HI>Champan,</HI> with a few Fish, was taken by the Vice-Admirals Boat near the Shore; and another larger Vessel, deserted by all her Men, was sunk by the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P>The eleventh, being <HI>Saturday, Van Campen</HI> went out again with his Frigats, to sail towards the North; but being driven Southerly by a strong contrary
<PB N="98" REF="59">
Current, he cast Anchor in fourteen Fathom Water, near one of the nether|most Islands of <HI>Pakka&punc;</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning, being the twelfth, they saw two Jonks in the South-West, seeming to steer towards <HI>Tinghay,</HI> which <HI>Van Campen</HI> chasing, endeavour'd to get to the Northwards; but labour'd in vain, because of contrary Winds and Tides: at last he was forc'd near the Islands of <HI>Pakka,</HI> which although<NOTE PLACE="marg">Islands of <HI>Pakka.</HI></NOTE> pretty large, yet are for the most part waste and untill'd, and inhabited by none but Fishers and poor Rusticks: Nevertheless there is good Harbor for Ships, and Refreshments of Water, and Provisions to be had.</P>
<P>The thirteenth, being <HI>Munday, Van Campen</HI> with the Ebb set Sail North|wards, between the Islands <HI>Pakka,</HI> in eighteen, nineteen, and twenty Fathom Water; but came, after the Tide spent, to Anchor in thirteen Fathom Water, under the Eastermost Island.</P>
<P>About Noon the Fleet weigh'd to get more towards the North, and against the Evening Anchor'd in eight Fathom Water, about half a League Nor-East|and-by-East from the Eastermost Isle before <HI>Pakka.</HI></P>
<P>The fourteenth <HI>Van Campen</HI> set Sail again with a Nor-Nor-East Wind, in six, seven, and eight Fathom, between the Isles of <HI>Pakka&punc;</HI> and about Noon, forc'd by contrary Tides, came to an Anchor in seven Fathom: Towards Evening weighing again with the Ebb, he let fall his Drag about midnight in eighteen Fathom, gravelly Ground, not far from the place where the Coast of <HI>China</HI> hath many high Mountains, and broken Land; yet behind them very pleasant and fertile Meadows and Rice-Fields.</P>
<P>The fifteenth setting Sail again, he Anchor'd about Noon under an Isle, in thirteen Fathom Water, gravelly Ground, about Cannon-shot from Shore, whither he sent his Boat to see for Water.</P>
<P>From hence setting Sail, he came into a Bay behind <HI>Campens Point,</HI> so call'd<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iohn Van Campen's <HI>Bay&punc;</HI></NOTE> from himself, where he dropp'd Anchor in five Fathom Water, there being a convenient Harbor, and safe Retreat against hollow Seas and turbulent Winds. On the North side of this Point, lying in twenty six Degrees and fifty one Minutes Northern Latitude, may be seen the Ruines of the City <HI>Tikyen,</HI> or <HI>Ty|kin,</HI> formerly a place of great Trade, but lately destroy'd by the <HI>Tartars.</HI> Here the <HI>Zierikzee's</HI> Boat was sent ashore, with the Pilot <HI>Auke Pieters,</HI> and thirteen Men, to fetch Water. Near the Shore, between the Mountains, appear'd a pleasant Valley, flourishing with Rice, Carrots, and all manner of Fruit. You may freely, without fear or danger, sail between the main Coast and these Isles; yet not without some care, because divers Shoals lie near the Coast.</P>
<P>The eighteenth, being <HI>Saturday, Van Campen</HI> set Sail with his Squadron, the Wind Nor-Nor-East; and laveering it between <HI>Campens Point</HI> and the fore|mention'd Isles, between seven and thirteen Fathom Water, gravelly Ground, they discover'd the old <HI>Zajer</HI> Isle East-Nor-East, four or five Leagues distant, in twenty seven Degrees and fifteen Minutes Northern Latitude, and about Noon came to an Anchor in ten Fathom Water, gravelly Ground. In the Night set|ting Sail again, they ran the next day about Noon behind <HI>Campens Bay,</HI> where they were forc'd to lie till <HI>Friday</HI> the twenty fourth, by contrary Winds, Tides, and Calms. Towards Night the <HI>Finch</HI> came also to an Anchor there.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the twenty fourth the Ships went to Sea together, and with a Nor-Nor-East Wind endeavor'd to sail Easterly; but being driven back by the Tide, they came to an Anchor in eight Fathom, and had the North Point of the Island with <HI>Brests,</HI> South-West, and the old <HI>Zajer&punc;</HI> East and by North. At
<PB N="99" REF="59">
Night, in the second Watch, when the Tide was almost spent, they weigh'd Anchor again, and the next Evening rode in eight Fathom Water, having the <HI>Chinese</HI> City <HI>Samzwa</HI> Nor-East and by East, and the Isle <HI>Old Zayer</HI> Sou-Sou-East, and Sou-East and by South, and the Isle with Breasts Sou-Sou-West.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Samzwa</HI> seated on the hanging of a Mountain, and planted round<NOTE PLACE="marg">City <HI>Samzwa&punc;</HI></NOTE> about with high Trees, was ruin'd by the <HI>Tartars:</HI> It boasts a safe Harbor for Ships, to defend them from the Southern and Northern stormy Seasons. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> going ashore here, found one <HI>Pagode</HI> or Temple, with divers Images, about fifteen Leagues from <HI>Tinghay.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty seventh the Point of <HI>Samzwa</HI> bearing Westward two Leagues from them, they descry'd a white Cliff in the Sea, about three Leagues from the Shore, and three Isles in the East-Nor-East, and by Observation found themselves at Noon to be in twenty seven Degrees and thirty nine Minutes Northern Latitude.</P>
<P>In the Evening <HI>Van Campen</HI> came to an Anchor with the <HI>Ankeveen</HI> Frigat in eleven Fathom Water, gravelly Ground; but the <HI>High-land</HI> and <HI>Meliskerk</HI> Fri|gats, with the <HI>Loenen</HI> and <HI>Finch,</HI> went behind the Isle of <HI>Good Hope. Van Campen</HI> in the Night, the Tide favoring him, set Sail again, and was follow'd by the <HI>Ankeveen</HI> Frigat onely, the other four lying still behind the Isle, without making the Reason thereof known.</P>
<P>The next day, forc'd by Storm to come to an Anchor again in ten Fathom Water, he was driven from two Anchors, towards the seven Rocks a little Southward of <HI>Zwatia,</HI> not without great danger of Shipwrack.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Zwatia,</HI> lying in the mouth of a River near the Sea, and also ruin'd<NOTE PLACE="marg">City <HI>Zwathia&punc;</HI></NOTE> by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> is inhabited by mean and poor People, which are very slow in rebuilding the same. Opposite to the Nor-West side of the River lies a Village call'd <HI>Zwatho,</HI> whither most of the Citizens fled, it being not laid waste by the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>The first of <HI>Ianuary, Van Campen</HI> concluded, upon Advice of the Ships Coun|cil, by force of a Storm out of the Nor-East and by East, to set Sail again, to get from the Shore; so that he drove down Sou-West and by South, to <HI>Brest-Island,</HI> and in the afternoon came to an Anchor in the Bay behind <HI>Campens</HI> Point in nine Fathom.</P>
<P>The other Frigats, and the <HI>Finch,</HI> lay still at Anchor, contrary to their Orders.</P>
<P>The third, the <HI>Ankeveen</HI> Frigat, commanded by <HI>Iacob Swart,</HI> having been bu|sied about getting his Anchors aboard, came and rode by the Vice-Admiral.</P>
<P>The fourth in the afternoon they spied in the Sou-Sou-West between seven|ty and eighty Fisher-Jonks, and other Vessels, standing towards the North, which they let all pass: About the evening they stood to and again, yet were got out of sight next Morning, on which the Captain <HI>Auke Pieters</HI> was com|manded to go ashore, with fifty Men, to gather Sallad-herbs and Potatoes to refresh their People.</P>
<P>The sixth in the Evening the four other Ships came to an Anchor near <HI>Van Campen,</HI> having before lain behind the Isles Northward of the River <HI>Zwatia.</HI></P>
<P>The eighth in the Morning they spied six Jonks fishing in the Sou-East and by East, behind the <HI>Breast-Isle;</HI> and in the afternoon, two Ships in the Sou-East, in the Bay of <HI>Pakka,</HI> and also heard the Report of several Cannon&punc; shot from thence; whereupon a Council being call'd, <HI>Harmans Symonsz,</HI> Comman|der of the <HI>High land</HI> Frigat, was sent thither, with Order, That when he came
<PB N="100" REF="60">
to them, he should fire five Guns one after another, if he needed <HI>Van Campen</HI>'s Assistance; if not, to fire none, but come back to the Fleet.</P>
<P>Against the Evening the <HI>High-land</HI> Frigat came to an Anchor South-West and by South, three Leagues distant from the Fleet.</P>
<P>The ninth in the morning they saw above twenty Fisher-Jonks near the Shore of <HI>Pakka,</HI> who were putting to Sea to fish; but not being able to get out, were by the Current driven towards the South: <HI>Van Campen</HI> chas'd them between the Islands; yet the Jonks by their swift sailing, escap'd him.</P>
<P>In the afternoon the <HI>Hollanders</HI> came again to an Anchor behind <HI>Campens Point,</HI> in nine Fathom Water, about a small Cannon-shot from the Shore.</P>
<P>The tenth they saw two Frigats in the Bay of <HI>Pakka, viz.</HI> the <HI>Sea-hound,</HI> in which the Admiral <HI>Bort</HI> was, (as they understood the next day) and the <HI>High|land,</HI> which on the eighth was sent thither for Intelligence.</P>
<P>The eleventh in the morning the Admiral <HI>Bort</HI> came in the <HI>High-land</HI> Frigat to an Anchor about half a League from the Vice-Admiral.</P>
<P>Mean while the Admiral <HI>Bort</HI> had by Storm taken the Fort <HI>Kitat,</HI> lying in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fort <HI>Kitat</HI> taken by the <HI>Netherlanders.</HI></NOTE> the Bay of <HI>Pakka,</HI> and with it plunder'd all the Towns, Villages, and Hamlets, being twenty in number, belonging thereto: All which he had written to the Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Campen,</HI> the tenth of the said Month, from the Bay of <HI>Pakka;</HI> adding thereto, That had he not been detain'd eight days by tempestuous Wea|ther, he had been with him before that time, to find out <HI>Zwathia,</HI> lying about the North, in hopes there to find several Trading Jonks.</P>
<P>The same day <HI>Harman Symonsz</HI> went aboard the Vice-Admiral, being sent thither by the Admiral from the Bay of <HI>Pakka,</HI> with the Letters before-men|tion'd, bringing also with him a small Supply of fresh Victuals, which was equally distributed amongst the Ships.</P>
<P>They found in <HI>Kitat</HI> nothing but a little Rice, Salt, and a little Lumber, besides twelve Women, and fifteen Youths, which were transported for Ser|vants to <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> fell upon this Place, because some of <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Party resided there.</P>
<P>The twelfth they descried three Jonks and a Fishers Boat in the North-East, one of them being without a Mast: <HI>Van Campen,</HI> by the Admirals Order, set Sail towards them with five Ships: That Jonk which had lost her Mast was onely taken, the rest escaping by the advantage of the Tide. In the taken Jonk they found no more but onely Salt, Rice, and Wood. Towards Evening the Frigat came again to the Prize-Jonk, and about eight at Night tow'd her along with them to <HI>Campens Point.</HI></P>
<P>In the afternoon the <HI>Sea-hound</HI> and <HI>High-land</HI> Frigats, and <HI>Ter-Boede</HI> Pink, came up to the Vice-Admiral, and at Night Anchor'd South and by West about a League from them.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday,</HI> being the thirteenth, the <HI>Ter-Boede</HI> was sent from the Fleet to the River <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> there to stay till <HI>Van Campen</HI>'s Squadron came back from the North.</P>
<P>Against Noon the <HI>Overveen</HI> Frigat came out of <HI>Kitat</HI>-Bay, near the Fleet, and turning up Northerly, in the afternoon was forc'd by contrary Winds to lie in seven Fathom water.</P>
<P>About midnight the Fleet weigh'd Anchor, and hearing several Cannons fired, and <HI>Van Campen</HI> fearing some of the Frigats to be run ashore, sent his Boats thither, and found the <HI>Calf</HI> to be drove very near the Shore, on which
<PB N="101" REF="60">
the <HI>High-land</HI> Frigat had also been fast, but was got off again: whereupon <HI>Van Campen</HI> return'd.</P>
<P><HI>Ysbrant,</HI> Pilot to the Admiral, and another, were sent aboard of the Vice-Admiral, to enquire how many healthy persons he had in his Ship, of Sea|men and Soldiers; and what number of Sea-men he could be able to send ashore fit for Service: whereupon he reply'd, about thirty.</P>
<P><HI>Thursday</HI> about Noon the Fleet was in twenty seven Degrees and nineteen Minutes Northern-Latitude, two Leagues and a half from West and by North from <HI>Zwamzwa</HI> Cape.</P>
<P>In the afternoon about two a Clock the Fleet weighed Anchor again, and in the Morning were within four Leagues North and by East of <HI>Zwatia,</HI> three Leagues East Nor-East from <HI>Cape Elephant,</HI> and three Leagues and a half West and by South from <HI>Zwamzwa.</HI> About Noon the Fleet, forc'd by contrary Winds and Tydes, cast Anchor in eleven or twelve Fathom Water, about three Leagues Nor-West, and Nor-West and by West from the River <HI>Zwatia,</HI> and two Leagues and a half South-east and by East from <HI>Cape Elephant;</HI> where Ri|ding all Night, they Sail'd next day toward the North, and soon after turn'd Westward up the River of <HI>Zwatia,</HI> where the Vice-Admiral had Cruised with six Sail the twenty eighth and twenty ninth of the last Moneth.</P>
<P>The Marks whereby Sea-men may know this River, are towards the North a great white Shelf, and on the Shore many Cliffs.</P>
<P>A little more to the Northward of it lie two Islands, behind which is a safe Harbor.</P>
<P>About Noon the Fleet found themselves in twenty seven Degrees and thirty five Minutes Eastward from the South-Point of the River <HI>Zwatia,</HI> from whence Sailing West-South-west into the River, they had from six to twenty three Fathom Water, being the shallowest gravelly Ground; and with the same Course they came before <HI>Zwatia,</HI> where they cast Anchor in seven Fa|thom Water, about a Musquet-shot from the Shore: on which the short-hair'd <HI>Chineses</HI> stood with Red Flags, (a sign of Peace by them, as the White is with us) in great companies, expecting the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> without any offering to come to their Ships. This continu'd a whole hour, when the Admiral <HI>Bort</HI> Commanded the Guns to be fir'd upon the Town. The <HI>Chineses</HI> thus rudely saluted, immediately let flie their White Flag in sign of War, and shooting with Musquets and Blunderbusses, flourish'd their Faulchions and Scythes over their Heads, yet betook themselves with all their Movables which they were able to carry out of the City, to flight towards the Mountains; others with their Vessels ran up the River; whereupon the Admiral <HI>Bort</HI> Commanded the Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Campen</HI> to go ashore with eight Boats and seven Shallops well Man'd and Arm'd, which <HI>Bort</HI> himself promis'd to follow. <HI>Van Campen</HI> Land|ing without any resistance on the Shore, found the City Re-built, and the Houses furnish'd with Tables, Chests, Stools, and Benches, besides abun|dance of Thrash'd and Unthrash'd Rice, call'd <HI>Bady,</HI> Salt, great store of dry'd and Salt Fish, and also Nets: There appear'd seven large Temples, every one apart in a pleasant Grove, Wall'd round about, and within Pav'd with Blue Stone, where stood many Humane Figures, Cloth'd in all sorts of Stuffs, Caps, Coats, Breeches, Shoes, and Stockings, all, as alive, about Tables on Wax'd Benches or Stools, Gilded; on each Table stood two large square Vessels, or Pots, wherein the Priests burn Incense to their Idols, with perfum'd <HI>Calambak, Agar,</HI> and <HI>Sandal-Wood,</HI> which yield a most fragrant smell.
<PB N="102" REF="61">
On the Tables also lay four pieces of Wood, each a large half Foot long, round on the top, and flat at the bottom, which, to know future events, they throw three times one after another before the Idols.</P>
<P>Towards Evening <HI>Van Campen</HI> leaving the Shore went aboard again with all his Men, loaden with the best Plunder, and many Images not spoil'd by the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>Here it is to be observ'd, that many Native <HI>Chineses</HI> are to be understood by<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Conquer'd <HI>Chineses</HI> wear their Hair short as the <HI>Tartars.</HI></NOTE> the Name of <HI>Tartars, viz.</HI> those who by shaving off their Hair, leaving onely a long Lock, have yielded themselves to the subjection of the <HI>Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary.</HI></P>
<P>The seventeenth, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> in the Morning the <HI>Ankeveen</HI> Frigat, and the <HI>Loenen</HI> and <HI>Finch</HI> Commanded by <HI>Ysbrant,</HI> Pilot of the <HI>Naerden,</HI> besides four Boats and a Sloop, Mann'd with Armed Soldiers and Sea-men, Sail'd up the River to surprize five Jonks laden with Goods, and said to lie for their safety a great way up the River, and if possible to bring them to the Fleet; but if not worth the trouble, to burn them. About Noon they came up with seven Jonks and three <HI>Coya's</HI> (which are a kind of Vessels lesser than Jonks, as our Mackrel-boats,) which Boarding, many <HI>Chineses</HI> with their Coats of Mayl, Helmets and Arms, leap'd over-board and swam, and others escap'd ashore in their <HI>Champans,</HI> and the rest, being most of them Women and Chil|dren, were taken by the <HI>Netherlanders;</HI> but all soon released, except five Women. Towards Evening the Master of the <HI>Finch</HI> went aboard the <HI>Naerden</HI> Frigat to the Admiral, with Tydings that their Vessels had conquer'd three great, and five small Jonks, amongst which some carry'd seven Guns of a side; whereup|on he was again sent withthe <HI>Meliskerks</HI> Boat and Pinnace, well Mann'd and furnish'd with Tackling, which he said was wanting for the taken Jonks; all which having aboard, he left the Frigat, and Sail'd up the River again in the Night.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the eighteenth about Day-break they heard a great Cry, made by the Men of the <HI>Meliskerks</HI> Boat, which was over-set near the Shore: whereupon <HI>Van Campen</HI> and the Master of the <HI>Sea-hound</HI> Sailing thither, found five Men sit|ting on the Keel of the Boat, so benumm'd with Cold, that they were not able to give account what was become of their Fellows; but Rowing up farther where the Boat had been over-set, they found another Man sitting on the Shore, which had been driven three times that Night into the River by the <HI>Chineses:</HI> He told them that he had not seen one of his Fellows; so that ten Men (they having been sixteen in number) were either drown'd or kill'd. At Night the <HI>Finches</HI> Pinnace went aboard the <HI>Naerden</HI> to the Admiral with a Letter of Advice, that they had taken eight Jonks, of which they had burnt four, and brought away the other four.</P>
<P>The nineteenth, being <HI>Tuesday,</HI> the <HI>Chineses</HI> made a Sign, by setting up their red Flag, inviting the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> to come to them: Whereupon <HI>Van Cam|pen</HI> and the Master of the <HI>Sea-hound</HI> went ashore to know what they desir'd, and Landing found a great number of <HI>Chineses</HI> with five red Flags of the five neigh|boring<NOTE PLACE="marg">The red Flag among the <HI>Tartar-Chineses</HI> signifies Peace, as the white Flag War.</NOTE> Villages, with the chief Governor from every Village, and five <HI>Chinese</HI> Priests.</P>
<P>These being carry'd aboard to the Admiral, begg'd and intreated, that he would save their Houses and Temples, that they might make Fires, and shelter themselves from the cold Winter; and likewise not to spoil their little <HI>Cham|pans</HI> and Fishing-nets; which if it might be granted, they would serve him in all things possible, and within four days bring him out of every Village twenty
<PB N="103" REF="61">
five Porkers, one hundred twenty five Hens, fifty Ducks, and as many Oranges, Raddishes, and other Herbage as they could gather: whereupon, in consideration they would keep their Promise, he assur'd them to save their <HI>Pagodes,</HI> Houses, <HI>Champans,</HI> and Fish-nets; after which three onely return'd ashore, for the other two were kept aboard, as Hostages till the three return'd in four days with the Provisions before-nam'd, and all things else they could get out of the five Villages. Those <HI>Chineses</HI> which stay'd aboard being ask'd by the Admiral, If no Jonks were expected that Season from Japan to <HI>Zwatia?</HI> they reply'd, That not one had Sail'd thither that Year; which afterwards he found to be true.</P>
<P>The twentieth, being <HI>Wednesday,</HI> the two Pinks and <HI>Ankeveen</HI> Frigat, sent up the River the seventh with four Boats and one Sloop, came to an Anchor with the six taken Jonks, <HI>viz.</HI> two great and four small: in which they found a lit|tle Rice, <HI>Pady,</HI> or unthresh'd Rice, Salt-petre, Indigo, several Priests Coats, Helmets, Swords, Scythes, ten Blunderbusses, besides several <HI>Chinese</HI> Men, Wo|men and Children, whereof five young Women, and four young Men were kept aboard, and the rest released. Seven other Jonks were also set on fire and sunk in the River, out of which many <HI>Chineses</HI> leaping were either drown'd and kill'd. The next day two of the small Jonks were broke up and us'd for fewel, but the biggest of them were new Trimm'd.</P>
<P>The two and twentieth they had a general Thanksgiving in all the Fleet for their Victories over their Enemies. The day after the Admiral by put|ting out the Companies red Flag, commanded all the Officers of the Fleet aboard, where the Ships Councel (for certain Reasons) propos'd, yet did not conclude, that the Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Campen</HI> with his Frigat, the <HI>Zierikzee,</HI> ac|company'd with the <HI>Highland, Meliskerke, Ankeveen,</HI> and the <HI>Loenen</HI> and the <HI>Finch,</HI> should Cruise out at Sea before <HI>Zwatia,</HI> to see for the <HI>Iapan</HI> Trading Jonks which come from thence, till the middle of <HI>February,</HI> and the Admiral <HI>Bort</HI> should put to Sea the twenty sixth with the <HI>Naerden, Calf, Overveen,</HI> and <HI>Sea-hound</HI> Frigats, besides the five Jonks, two great and three small, and cross over to <HI>Kitat</HI> and <HI>Tenhay,</HI> and from thence Sail to the River <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> there to enquire how affairs stood. It was also judg'd convenient, that the <HI>Ankeveen</HI> Frigat, and the <HI>Loenen</HI> and <HI>Finch,</HI> should immediately weigh their An|chors, and Sail to the Mouth of the foremention'd River, to look for some Jonks that were daily expected; but these Proposals never were put into exe|cution.</P>
<P>The twenty fourth in the Morning, <HI>Van Campen</HI> was by <HI>Borts</HI> Order sent ashore with a hundred and ten Soldiers, and fifty Sea-men, to burn <HI>Zwatia.</HI> No sooner was he Landed, but they saw five Priests, with a great many <HI>Chineses</HI> standing about a red Flag, which all fell down at his Feet, and humbly begg'd him to save their Temples, <HI>Champans,</HI> and Fish-nets, which if he did not, they should perish with Cold and Hunger; and promis'd against the next Morning (according to their first Proposal) to bring them the Porkers, Hens, Ducks, Oranges, Raddishes, and Pot-herbs: <HI>Van Campen</HI> mov'd with compassion, was perswaded to forbear.</P>
<P>The twenty fifth, being <HI>Christmas</HI>-day, <HI>Van Campen</HI> going aboard to the Admi|ral in the <HI>Naerden</HI> Frigat, ask'd him what was best to be done with <HI>Zwatia?</HI> whereupon <HI>Bort</HI> reply'd, <HI>That he should lay it in Ashes:</HI> which said, <HI>Van Campen</HI> went ashore with three Boats and three Sloops well Mann'd, where he found lying on the Shore five Hogs and fifteen Baskets of Oranges, brought thither
<PB N="104" REF="62">
by five Priests and fifteen <HI>Chineses:</HI> two of the Hogs, and five Baskets of Oranges were by <HI>Van Campen</HI> carry'd aboard to the Admiral, who remitting somewhat of his anger, gave him order to do with <HI>Zwatia</HI> what he pleas'd and thought convenient: But before <HI>Van Campen</HI> came ashore again, the Houses were all in a Flame, occasion'd through the wilfulness of the Sea-men. Out of the Houses and <HI>Pagodes</HI> came divers sick Men and Women creeping on their Knees to escape the Flames.</P>
<P>The same day the Admiral leaving <HI>Zwatia,</HI> according to their agreement in the Councel, with the <HI>Naerden, Ankeveen, Calf,</HI> and <HI>Sea-hound</HI> Frigat&punc; two great and two small taken Jonks, went to the Bay of <HI>Kitat</HI> and <HI>Tenhay,</HI> to go from thence in some of the Frigats to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> as was before design'd.</P>
<P>The twenty sixth <HI>Van Campen</HI> put also to Sea with four Frigats and two Pinks, wherewith steering about the Shore towards the North, they came to an Anchor in the Evening near an Island (by them call'd <HI>The Good Hope,</HI>) three Leagues Northerly from the River <HI>Zwatia,</HI> in twenty four Fathom Water, gra|velly Ground, about Cannon-shot from the Shore.</P>
<P>The Admirals Order to <HI>Van Campen,</HI> was to keep that Course, or to Cruise for the <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonks that Traded to <HI>Iapan,</HI> till the middle of <HI>February,</HI> and then to fall down Southerly to <HI>Tenhay.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty seventh the Councel in <HI>Van Campens</HI> Squadron Consulted, whe|ther according to <HI>Bort</HI>'s Order they should keep at Sea, or lie still near the Isle of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> and to place six or seven Men on one of the highest Hills, there to spy what Jonks were out in the Offin: To which last Proposal they all agreed, from thence Sailing early the next day, with intention to get up higher, yet were by contrary Winds and cross Currents forc'd back to their former Road.</P>
<P>The twenty eighth, being <HI>Thursday,</HI> seven Men were sent ashore, as they had before agreed, up to a rising Ground, there with their Glasses to descry what Traffickers that Sea afforded. In the afternoon six <HI>Chineses</HI> came in a <HI>Champan</HI> aboard the Vice-Admiral, bringing with them a fat Swine, nine Hens, twenty four Ducks, eleven Baskets with Oranges, and fourteen Pum|peons, not having a greater store: Amongst them were two of their Priests, which they kept aboard till they should return with more Provisions, which they promis'd in three days; but they fail'd, not coming the third day, yet <HI>Van Campen</HI> set the Pledges ashore on the twenty sixth, who afterwards return'd to inquire for one <HI>Chilo,</HI> a <HI>Chinese</HI> Merchant, whom they fear'd was slain, or their Prisoner: <HI>Van Campen</HI> answer'd, That he knew of none such, but would enquire of the Admiral, and if he found him alive in the Fleet, he should be set ashore at <HI>Tenhay;</HI> they humbly thanking him, and having receiv'd satisfa|ction for their Provisions, departed.</P>
<P>The twenty ninth some of the Vice-Admiral's Men went ashore for Wood and Water; where also they Shot a great Hart, and therefore call'd it <HI>Harts-Isle.</HI></P>
<P>The one and thirtieth, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> they espi'd two Fishers-Jonks in the East, which <HI>Van Campen</HI> chasing took, with thirteen <HI>Chineses,</HI> some fresh and salted Fish, which were taken out, and carry'd aboard the Vice-Admiral. The <HI>Chinese</HI> Prisoners being examin'd in the presence of the Commanders from whence they came? reply'd, From <HI>Zwatia:</HI> If they had seen any <HI>Holland</HI> Ships? answer'd <HI>No:</HI> and being demanded if no Jonks were expected that Season from <HI>Iapan</HI> at <HI>Zwatia?</HI> they also reply'd, <HI>No:</HI> and being farther ask'd if none went that Year from <HI>Zwatia</HI> to <HI>Iapan,</HI> and if some Jonks about two days
<PB N="105" REF="62">
before had not Sail'd from <HI>Zwatia</HI> towards the North? they again answer'd <HI>No:</HI> so that the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> could get nothing out of them: whereupon they were order'd to be kept aboard the Vice-Admiral, till he thought fit to send them out a Fishing for the Fleet.</P>
<P>After the Admiral's and Vice-Admirals parting at <HI>Zwatia</HI> the twenty fifth of <HI>December,</HI> the Admiral arriv'd before <HI>Hoksieu</HI> the twenty seventh of the same Moneth, having in his Way, especially in the Bay of <HI>Succor,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Siang,</HI> in the Rode of <HI>Pakka,</HI> and likewise in that of <HI>Good Fortune,</HI> seen and met several Jonks, which all escaped from him by flight, except five. But at <HI>So|thun,</HI> a Town which <HI>Bort</HI> sent out a Party against, having one Man kill'd, and five wounded; yet the next day with better success Charging the Enemy out of Town, he Commanded that, and likewise all the Houses in <HI>Tenhay</HI> to be burnt.</P>
<P>At the earnest Requests of those of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and the Agents Letters to the Admiral, he went thither the seventh of <HI>Ianuary, Anno</HI> 1663. with the <HI>Overveen, Seahound,</HI> and all the Prize-Jonks; but the <HI>Calf</HI> and <HI>Naerden</HI> Frigats had Order to stay at <HI>Tenhay,</HI> and not upon any occasion to go ashore, for the prevention of all Mischiefs; yet in fair Weather they sometimes sail'd to the neighboring Isles, to see for the Enemies Jonks, especially those that come from <HI>Iapan:</HI> all which the Admiral gave advice of to the Vice-Admiral by the fore-mention'd Letters, adding that the small taken Jonks were fitted and made ready to Sail with News to their Excellencies the Lord-General and Councel at <HI>Batavia:</HI> to which purpose he had given a Pacquet of Letters to Captain <HI>Barrents Io|chemse,</HI> which he had Order immediately to send away by the Jonks, and then come to him with all speed. But if upon the <HI>Tartars</HI> desire he should re-deli|ver the Jonks, he intended to make use of the <HI>Ter-Boede;</HI> and to that end at his coming into the River of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> where it now lay, he would send it away to the other Ships.</P>
<P>The sixth, being <HI>Tuesday, Van Campen</HI> summon'd the Commanders of all the Ships in his Squadron to come aboard, where after Consultation they conclu|ded, if that day, or early on the next, they had no News out of the River <HI>Hok|sieu,</HI> to send the <HI>Highland</HI> Frigat to the Admiral in that River, there to enquire how affairs went, which they were very desirous to know, because they had receiv'd no Advices, nor heard from them since the twenty fifth of the last, to the seventh of that Moneth.</P>
<P>The seventh they resolv'd (the time to Sail back to <HI>Batavia</HI> drawing near) to send the <HI>Loenen</HI> and the <HI>Finch</HI> to fetch Water, as well for themselves as for the other Ships, which were to carry their empty Casks aboard them, and at their return when fill'd to fetch them again: Mean while the Boats of those Ships that stay'd should go ashore for Fewel, that when part or all the Fleet should put to Sea, there might be no want.</P>
<P>The same day the <HI>Terr-Boede</HI> coming from the River <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> in the Evening anchor'd behind <HI>Van Campen</HI> at <HI>Tenhay,</HI> from whence according to <HI>Bort</HI>'s Order he was to go by <HI>Siam</HI> to <HI>Batavia,</HI> but first to speak with <HI>Van Campen</HI> at <HI>Tenhay.</HI></P>
<P>The tenth, being <HI>Saturday,</HI> the <HI>Ter-Boede</HI> set Sail, being sent as an Advice-Boat, under the Command of <HI>Nanning Claesz</HI> to <HI>Batavia,</HI> the same day the <HI>Highland</HI> Frigat, Commanded by <HI>Harmon Simonse,</HI> and the <HI>Ankeveen</HI> by <HI>Iacob Black,</HI> went to the River of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> according to the Admiral's Order, Dated the seventh.</P>
<P>The eleventh they saw four Sail in the River <HI>Hoksieu:</HI> and now the Crui|sing
<PB N="106" REF="63">
up and down with the Frigats for Jonks that Traded to <HI>Iapan</HI> was laid quite aside by reason of bad Weather, and till further Order from the Admiral, which <HI>Van Campen</HI> by Letters of the seventh of <HI>Ianuary</HI> advised him of from his Fleet lying before <HI>Tenhay.</HI></P>
<P>The fourteenth in the Morning the <HI>Ankeveen</HI> Frigat came out of the River <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> into the Bay of <HI>Linkun,</HI> to turn about the North to <HI>Tenhay,</HI> but the Tyde being spent he could not get forward; which being seen by <HI>Van Campen,</HI> he immediately sent the Pilot, <HI>Iohn Cortz,</HI> with a well Mann'd Sloop thither to enquire after affairs, before whose return seven Glasses were run; yet at last he return'd with <HI>Iacob Black,</HI> Master of the <HI>Ankeveen,</HI> who brought a Letter with him from the Admiral, Dated the seventh of the same Moneth in the <HI>Ankeveen,</HI> then Riding in the Channel of <HI>Hoksieu;</HI> the Contents were these: <Q>That <HI>Nobel</HI> with all his Attendants were detain'd in <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and not permitted to come aboard; That himself was come with all the Ships down to the Mouth of the River, where stopp'd by contrary Winds from coming to him, he had lay'n three days, but would have come in stead of the Letter, had not the Night before three Vessels come down the River with <HI>Melman,</HI> two <HI>Man|darins</HI> and Letters from <HI>Nobel</HI> and the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> and General <HI>Lipovi,</HI> who still desir'd the stay of all or some of the Fleet fifteen or twenty days longer for an Answer from <HI>Peking;</HI> which if he would not do, <HI>Nobel</HI> and all his Retinue must be forc'd to wait there, and mean while Trade in private, selling some of their Merchandise, and buying others; about which he was to resolve the next day with the two <HI>Mandarins</HI> that were sent to him, there|fore he desir'd <HI>Van Campen,</HI> on receipt of the Letter, to come to him with all speed in one of the Frigats that least drew Water, that he might consult with him about it, and resolve what was best to be done: <HI>Bort</HI> desir'd <HI>Van Campen</HI> also to leave Order with the Ships to store themselves plentifully with Wa|ter and Firing at <HI>Tenhay,</HI> that when the other Ships came to them, they might furnish them also, that then they might proceed on their Journey to <HI>Batavia</HI> without any hinderance.</Q> Whereupon <HI>Van Campen</HI> went in his Ship aboard of the <HI>Ankeveen</HI> Frigat, lying at Anchor about half way at Sea, between the River <HI>Hoksieu</HI> and <HI>Tenhay,</HI> and came about four hours after Sun-set West and by North right against the Pyramids, but being forc'd by a contrary Tyde to cast Anchor in fourteen Foot Water, hapned to be aground; yet soon after was by the Tyde put afloat again, and the same Night came to the Admiral; who be|ing fetch'd aboard the next Morning, he understood that the Secretaries Clerk, or Interpreter, <HI>Iohn Melman,</HI> was the Night before gone to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> from whence he was to come the eighteenth of the same Moneth, with the Merchant <HI>Constan|tine Nobel,</HI> and that then all things would be in readiness for them to put to Sea. Five <HI>Tartar</HI> Jonks came with three <HI>Mandarins,</HI> and cast Anchor near <HI>Van Campen,</HI> sent thither by the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> and the General <HI>Taysing Lipovy,</HI> with two hundred Picols of Rice, twenty Porkers, and twenty great Vessels of <HI>Chinese</HI> Beer, which were sent to be divided as a Present amongst the Sea-men.</P>
<P>The sixteenth the <HI>Ankeveen</HI> set Sail out of the River to the Ships at <HI>Tenhay,</HI> and came thither again the next day with some Goods for the Admiral, and a Chest for the Secretary of the <HI>Naerden</HI> Frigat, who was to stay ashore in <HI>Hok|sieu.</HI> The same day <HI>Van Campen</HI> Embarq'd himself with his Necessaries.</P>
<P>The eighteenth in the Morning the <HI>Domburgh</HI> and <HI>Overveen</HI> set Sail out of <HI>Hoksieu</HI> to the Ships at <HI>Tenhay:</HI> In the afternoon the Admiral receiv'd a Letter from <HI>Constantine Nobel,</HI> c&oacute;ntaining, That the Admiral should stay ten
<PB N="107" REF="63">
days longer for the Emperors Letters from <HI>Peking,</HI> and that they requir'd also two Hostages, <HI>viz.</HI> the Vice-Admiral <HI>Van Campen,</HI> and the Captain with one Eye, not knowing his Name, which was <HI>Ysbrant Builder:</HI> but neither the Ad|miral nor Vice-Admiral thought this advice fit to be follow'd.</P>
<P>The twentieth the Deputy-Secretary, <HI>Iohn Melman,</HI> came in a <HI>Tartar</HI> Vessel from <HI>Hoksieu</HI> to the Ships, but it was so foggy, that those of the Fleet, being not able to see him, but hearing him Row, hal'd him aboard: <HI>Van Campen</HI> also Rowing in his Sloop to meet him, was three hours before he could either find the <HI>Tartar</HI> Vessels or his own Frigats again, notwithstanding they were very near, and had it not been for the sound of the Trumpets, it had been impossible to have found one another that Night.</P>
<P>The one and twentieth <HI>Van Campen</HI> hoised Sail, and with a gentle Gale out of the North North-east came to the Channel of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> where he lay by the Ad|miral in five Fathom gravelly Ground.</P>
<P>The two and twentieth in the Morning the <HI>Sea-hound</HI> Frigat set Sail with a fresh North-east Wind; but <HI>Van Campen,</HI> advised by <HI>Iacob Swaert,</HI> and the chief Pilot <HI>Claes Iohnson,</HI> who told him that in such blustering Weather their Ships could not be rul'd, because of their fresh experienc'd Sea-men, and that they had better stay for fairer Weather, stirred not: In the afternoon, the Wind blowing very hard out of the same Quarter, and the Sea growing very rough, drove the <HI>Ankeveen</HI> towards the Pyramids from her Anchor, and enforc'd them to cast out another; which done, they weighed the first Anchor, supposing it to be incumbred; then the Frigat dragg'd the other; and being engag'd among the Rocks, had neither time nor distance to drop another; whereupon the Master loosned his Fore-sail and Mizzen, so bearing up to the wind to keep her from what they were almost upon, the <HI>Rocky Shore;</HI> but all endeavors were in vain, for with the headiness of the Stream, the violence of the Wind, and hollowness of the Sea, she was driven upon the cruel Shore, and carry'd where she was hemm'd in with Rocks; when to prevent the mischief they sent a Boat from the Ship with Tackling; but that also not able to keep off, was with the Frigat driven among intervening Rocks beyond the Ship, while she bilging against the Pyramids was split: when to save the Men a Sea-man was order'd to swim to Shore with the Plumming-line, to which they fastned a stronger Rope, by which help they might betwixt swimming and wading get ashore; but he was so bruised and beaten by the Billows upon the Rocks where he Landed, that he was not able to draw the Halser to the Shore: but about two hours after Sun-set the Sea did with her impetuous Waves so batter the Frigat, and she rol|ling so much, that they look'd every Minute to be stav'd, they were forc'd to cut down their Masts by the Board for the preservation of their lives. About two hours after Sun-set <HI>Van Campen</HI> sent one or two ashore on the West-side of the Pyramids, to make fast a Halser on the Rocks for the purpose before|mention'd: after that <HI>Van Campen</HI> Sail'd up the River <HI>Hoksieu</HI> to look for his Boat, but could not find her.</P>
<P>The twenty third, being <HI>Thursday, Van Campen</HI> went ashore with a Sloop on an Island lying close by the Pyramids, to see if any sweet Water was to be had there, which they found in a Pit or Well. A Tent also was carry'd ashore and set up, into which they brought Rice, Beef, Pork, and fresh Water for those that were Ship-wrack'd, where two by Cold and drinking of Brandy, misera|bly lost their Lives in the Night.</P>
<P>The twenty fourth in the Morning some <HI>Chineses</HI> coming to a Jonk by <HI>Van</HI>

<HI>Campen</HI> on the Island, proffer'd to carry him to the Fort <HI>Minjazen,</HI> saying that the Governor <HI>Hanlavia</HI> would entertain him nobly; for they suppos'd the Fleet to have been gone to <HI>Batavia:</HI> they also gave him some fresh Pork, Eggs, and Rice, and shew'd him other Civilities.</P>
<P>The Admiral by Letters advis'd <HI>Van Campen</HI> the same day, that all his expe|ctation and stay was for him, that they might set Sail together, but suppos'd that the bad Weather had hindred him from coming out; and that in the Morning when he heard him Shoot, he was about weighing Anchor with all the Ships that were with him at <HI>Tenhay,</HI> of which he had sent him the <HI>Finch</HI> and <HI>Sea-hound,</HI> and desiring him, that if any more Tydings came from <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> that he should Fire three times, and for a little while keep in his Flag.</P>
<P>The same day the <HI>Sea-hound</HI> Frigat and <HI>Finch</HI> came to an Anchor near the Wreck in the River of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> whither <HI>Van Campen</HI> went immediately with his Boat, to see what Goods could be sav'd; which to do was almost impossible, because of the raging Billows, which beat so violently that no Boat was able to come near her. In the interim the Fleet which lay at <HI>Tenhay</HI> also setting Sail, fell down towards the Wreck; yet afterwards changing their purpose, Tack'd about, lying Northward.</P>
<P>The twenty fifth the Admiral's Sloop, with his chief Pilot, went aboard the the Vice-Admiral in the <HI>Sea-hound</HI> Frigat; from whence after midnight he was sent again to the Fleet with News concerning the Wreck. Little was per|form'd that day, no Vessels being able to lie near the foundred Ship: but the next day they recover'd some Cordage, Lead, Tin, and <HI>Sandal</HI>-Wood, which was put aboard the other Frigats.</P>
<P>The twenty seventh, fetching the last Cables that lay on the Deck, they car|ry'd them aboard the <HI>Sea-hound</HI> in the Night; and then likewise sav'd the Guns and some Shot.</P>
<P>The next day seven <HI>Tartar</HI> Jonks came to an Anchor near the Wreck; to which <HI>Van Campen</HI> Rowing, put one <HI>Mey</HI> aboard to look to the Pepper, and other Goods that were yet remaining; which at last being given to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> was by them esteem'd a great Prize.</P>
<P>In the afternoon the <HI>Sea-hound</HI> and <HI>Finch</HI> weighed and set Sail to get out of the Channel of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and came towards Evening to an Anchor by the Fleet in the Bay of <HI>Linkun,</HI> where <HI>Van Campen</HI> immediately went aboard of the <HI>Naer|den</HI> to the Admiral <HI>Bort;</HI> to whom having given a Relation concerning the loss of the <HI>Ankeveen,</HI> he Row'd aboard the <HI>Zirickzee.</HI></P>
<P>The first of <HI>March,</HI> being <HI>Thursday,</HI> the Admiral at Day-break fir'd a Gun, as a Signal that the Fleet should all weigh Anchor, and putting to Sea, proceed on their Way to <HI>Batavia.</HI> In the Evening about Sun-set they came up with the South-Point of the Isle of <HI>Crocodiles,</HI> which bore South-west about five Leagues, and the South-Point of <HI>Carellos</HI> Nor-Nor-east about six Leagues from them, their Course West-South-west.</P>
<P>The second they saw several Fishers Jonks near the Coast, and about Noon came into twenty four Degrees and fifty three Minutes Northern Latitude, and had the Southern Island <HI>Makau</HI> North-west and by West about five Leagues from them, they steering South-west, and West and by South.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday,</HI> being the third, the Fleet at Sun-set was about three Leagues and a half from another Isle; and on the next day at Noon in twenty two De|grees and thirty eight Minutes Nor-Nor-East, about four Leagues from the <HI>Sandy Banks;</HI> and against Evening came up with the <HI>Black Hill</HI> on the Coast of

<P>The fifth the Fleet was about five or six Leagues from <HI>Ilhas dons Viedos;</HI> and at Noon in twenty one Degrees and twenty nine Minutes; the next day in twenty Degrees and thirty Minutes; and the day after, being <HI>Wednesday,</HI> at Noon in nineteen Degrees and fifty Minutes.</P>
<P>On <HI>Thursday Van Campen</HI> was got out of sight of the Fleet in nineteen De|grees and thirty six Minutes; and the next day reach'd nineteen Degrees and twenty Minutes.</P>
<P>The tenth in the Morning he came up with the East-Point of the Island <HI>Ainan,</HI> but at a great distance from him, and found himself at Noon in nineteen Degrees and twenty four Minutes Northern Latitude, the East Point West and by South, and West-South-west, about four or five Leagues, and <HI>Poele Tayo,</HI> North-west, about three or four Leagues distant: The East-Point of <HI>Ainan</HI> ap|pears like two Isles as you come about the North.</P>
<P>The twelfth about Noon <HI>Van Campen</HI> was in eighteen Degrees and twenty seven Minutes, three Leagues from the South Coast of <HI>Ainan,</HI> which is found to be six or seven and forty Minutes more Southerly than it is placed in the Maps; and in the afternoon coming near the Shore, he espy'd the Fleet stand|ing South-South-east; and the next Morning he descry'd the Admiral <HI>Bort</HI> with seven Sail, to lie a little to Leeward on his Larboard. About Noon be|ing eighteen Degrees and thirty two Minutes, the Mount <HI>Tinhosa</HI> bore West and by North, about four Leagues from him, appearing like three Isles, whereof the middlemost is the biggest: More into the Countrey are two other Hills to be seen; and in the South-west and by West many Highlands: The South-west Shore was seen in the South-west and by South, about four or five Leagues from him. This Countrey is not rightly placed in the Maps, neither in its due Latitude nor Longitude; for it lies forty six or forty seven Minutes more Southerly in the Maps than it stands.</P>
<P>The fourteenth in the Morning the Admiral <HI>Bort</HI> with all the other Ships were behind in the Channel East-North-east, and about Noon in eighteen De|grees and seventeen Minutes Sail'd Northerly up to the Fleet, which in the Evening came up with <HI>Tinhosa:</HI> The next day at Noon they came to seven|teen Degrees and fifty nine Minutes, and the day after to Fifteen Degrees and forty Minutes Northern-Latitude, their Course South.</P>
<P>The seventeenth about Day-break they espy'd the Coast of <HI>Champan,</HI> which is very high Land, lying South-west and by West from them: Six hours after they discern'd the Isle call'd <HI>Round Holm,</HI> near the Coast of <HI>Champan,</HI> and about Noon were in the Latitude of twelve Degrees and ten Minutes; and Sailing along the foremention'd Coast, in the Evening they past by the Bay call'd <HI>Ba|gerang,</HI> and about Sun-set they descry'd <HI>Poele,</HI> or the Isle <HI>Cicier de Terra,</HI> West|wards about a League from them.</P>
<P>The eighteenth <HI>Van Campen</HI> being about midnight separated from the Fleet, found himself about Noon in nine Degrees and nine Minutes, and about Sun|set saw <HI>Poele Candor</HI> West-Nor-West, five Leagues from him, his Course South-West and by South.</P>
<P>The nineteenth he came into six Degrees and twenty nine Minutes; the twentieth, in four Degrees and thirty Minutes; and on the one and twentieth, in the Morning seeing <HI>Poele Tymon</HI> South-west and by South about three Leagues distant, he made towards it, and dropp'd Anchor at the South-Point

<P>The next day about Sun-rising <HI>Panyang</HI> bare about four Leagues to the South South-East from them: At Noon the Fleet found themselves to be in forty six Minutes Northern-Latitude, and saw <HI>Panyang</HI> West and by North; and about Sun-set they saw <HI>Pismires-Isle</HI> in the South-west about four Leagues di|stant, and the Island <HI>Lingen</HI> South-west, and South-west and by South, about six or seven Leagues off: and about Noon the next day <HI>Van Campen</HI> was with the Fleet in six Minutes Southern-Latitude, and saw about Sun-set <HI>Poele,</HI> or the Island <HI>Saya,</HI> South and by West, and the Cape of <HI>Lingen</HI> Nor-West and by West, three or four Leagues from them.</P>
<P>The twenty fifth they discern'd the <HI>Seven Islands,</HI> or <HI>Poele Toutyons,</HI> in the South-east and by South, and <HI>Poele Saya</HI> in the Nor-West, and Nor-West and by West: about Noon the <HI>Poele Toutyons</HI> were Eastwards four or five Leagues from the <HI>Zirickzee.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty sixth they descry'd the Mountain <HI>Monapin</HI> about Sun-rising to lie South-east and by East, about five Leagues distant, and at Noon about three Leagues from thence they were in two Degrees and nine Minutes South-Lati|tude: At Night about Sun-set they saw the third Point of the Island <HI>Sumatra</HI> South-South-east, two Leagues from them, and <HI>Poele Nanko</HI> East and by North, about three Leagues from the <HI>Zirickzee;</HI> and <HI>Monapin</HI> in the Nor-West, and Nor-West and by North, all lying along the Coast of <HI>Sumatra.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty seventh at Sun-rising they descry'd the first Point of <HI>Sumatra</HI> South-east, and South-East and by East, about two Leagues and a half from the <HI>Zirickzee,</HI> who at Noon was in three Degrees and five Minutes South Latitude; and having the Island <HI>Lucipar</HI> South-east about three Leagues from him, Sail'd close along the Coast.</P>
<P>The next day about Noon the <HI>Zirickzee</HI> was in four Degrees and twelve Mi|nutes Southern Latitude, and on the twenty ninth in the Morning coming up with the <HI>Thousand Islands,</HI> which lay Westward from him, he espy'd the Admi|ral <HI>Bort</HI> with seven Sail in the Nor-East and by East, and one lying at an An|chor near the Island <HI>Agnietes.</HI> At two a Clock in the afternoon the Fleet came to an Anchor before <HI>Batavia,</HI> where they found the following Frigat and Pinks, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Stadthouse</HI> Frigat of <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> the <HI>Holland Remedy,</HI> the <HI>Nightin|gale</HI> Pink, the <HI>Arms of Batavia</HI> a Frigat, the <HI>Griffin,</HI> being the Reer-Admiral of the Harbor.</P>

<HEAD>A CONTINUATION OF THE Second Embassy;</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Being a Journal of the Adventures that happened to the two Fleets sent from <HI>Batavia</HI> to the Isles of <HI>Formosa, Tayowan,</HI> and the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> under the Command of <HI>Balthazar Bort,</HI> as Admiral, and General of the Land-Forces, since the Year 1663. <HI>Iune</HI> the 27. until <HI>Anno</HI> 1664. <HI>March</HI> the 21.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_THe great Damage which the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> suffer'd, <HI>Anno</HI> 1661. by the loss of <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa,</HI> taken from them by the Pyrate <HI>Coxinga,</HI> not only staining their Honor, but also damnifying their Estates, and preju|dicial to their Trade, was not satisfi'd by the Fleet and Land-Soldiers, sent out the last Year, as was expect|ed, because the <HI>Tartars</HI> were not only wanting to joyn their Forces for the Defeating of the common Enemy, but also detain'd them most of the time idly at <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> feeding the Admiral with fair Promises, without any performance, although a fit opportunity seem'd to be presented to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> because the Enemy by the death of their General <HI>Coxinga</HI> were all in confusion; yet notwithstand|ing, as our former Relation mentions, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Fleet at several times took thirty three Jonks, besides many lesser Vessels which they burnt, and also the strong Fort of <HI>Kitat,</HI> leaving whole Towns and Villages in Flames, whose Inhabitants fled to the Mountains, whilst the <HI>Tartars</HI> took not the least Cog|nizance thereof, although they knew that <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Party made Overtures of Peace, and had to that purpose sent Ambassadors to their Emperor at <HI>Peking,</HI> as it was reported at the departure of the Fleet; though his Majesty having put them off with dilatory answers, signifying altogether, that they should shew the first Point of their Obedience, by wearing short Hair, as himself and all his Subjects did, which (as the <HI>Hollanders</HI> suppos'd) might procrastinate the business; and besides all this, the <HI>Tartars</HI> did not perform what they promis'd concerning the inlargement of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Prisoners, yet confin'd in the Isle <HI>Ey|muy,</HI> although they shew'd all outward Civilities in their Entertainments, still Complementing their Ambassadors, yet would not grant them a free Trade before they had full Orders from the Emperor, with which they held so long
<PB N="112" REF="67">
in suspence so long, that they would not any longer attend with their whole Fleet such continual delays; but having done little or nothing, set Sail from thence the first of <HI>March,</HI> and came safe on the twenty ninth of the same Month before <HI>Batavia,</HI> leaving the <HI>Ankeveen</HI> Frigat behind them, which suffer'd Ship-wrack before the Channel of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> as before mention'd; and the Mer|chant <HI>Constantine Nobel,</HI> with eight <HI>Netherlanders</HI> which were kept by the <HI>Tartars;</HI> and as their Governors pretended, in kindness to them, that they should not return until they carry'd from the Emperor what should give satisfaction to their General <HI>Maetzuiker;</HI> all which cast up together, amounted to more Jea|lousie, than Hopes, so that Ballancing their Actions, they could not positively say, that either they were Friends or Enemies whom they Treated with: Yet howsoever, let them be what they will, whither against the General <HI>Maetzuiker</HI> and his Council in <HI>Batavia,</HI> pitch'd resolutely upon, that with all their Forces they would prosecute those that had done them their Injury, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Coxingans,</HI> and would never hearken to any accommodation, until by reprisal or other|wise, they had fully satisfi'd themselves of the Damages sustain'd in <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa.</HI> Which Decree of theirs was luckily confirm'd by Letters from their Masters at <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> bearing Date <HI>October</HI> the 22. <HI>Anno</HI> 1662. Whereby they were inform'd, that a Peace was concluded between <HI>Holland</HI> and the <HI>Por|tuguese,</HI> which giving them more liberty, they prepar'd to equip their Navy with greater speed and diligence, and send forth once more, under the Com|mand of <HI>Balthazar Bort,</HI> to the Coast of <HI>China;</HI> and if by Treaty with the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> they could not obtain their desires, they would try what they could do by force of Arms, and look upon both as one Enemy.</P>
<P>In this their great Expedition, sixteen Ships were appointed, and fitted out with Men and Arms according to the following Schedule.</P>

<P>To use no Hostility to the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> because of the concluded Peace.</P>
<P>Let the Merchandize which are distributed in the Fleet, if the <HI>Tartars</HI> will not permit a free Trade, be sent to <HI>Iapan;</HI> and likewise keep the four Mer|chants Freighted thither in your company, till you come within sight of
<PB N="114" REF="68">
<HI>Formosa,</HI> then let them proceed on their Voyage, except the <HI>Amstellant,</HI> which shall Sail with you to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> to take in the Merchandize for the <HI>Chinesy</HI> Trade, out of the several Ships (but if they will not allow it) then carry them to <HI>Iapan.</HI></P>
<P>Make your first coming at <HI>Hoksieu</HI> known to the Governor of the Fort <HI>Min|jazeen,</HI> and sending a <HI>Chinesy</HI> ashore, ask for the Merchant <HI>Constantine Nobel,</HI> de|siring him to come aboard.</P>
<P>If all things stand well in <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> send their Excellencies Letter by some per|son of Quality to the Governors, and desire their Answer to it.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Tartars</HI> are united with the <HI>Coxingans,</HI> and would perswade you not to use Hostility, by no means condescend, except they will consent to make good the Damage which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had suffer'd in <HI>Tayowan,</HI> and Surrender up <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Tayowan,</HI> with all the Forts and Castles; and also procure the Emperors Letters to forbid the <HI>Chinesys</HI> to Trade with any, but with our Peo|ple in <HI>Tayowan:</HI> Neither should any <HI>Chinesys</HI> Sail with their Jonks Southward of the Isle <HI>Ainan,</HI> nor to <HI>Iapan;</HI> and that those which were found there, might be taken by them; and also to release the <HI>Netherland</HI> Prisoners.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chinesys</HI> shall be permitted to Sail to <HI>Batavia</HI> and <HI>Malakka,</HI> provided they have our Pastports, if the Article of their not Sailing to <HI>Iapan</HI> be too hard for them, pass it by.</P>
<P>But all the other Proposals must be perform'd, which if not, no way to agree with them; and that they should also get the Articlrs concluded upon Sign'd and Seal'd at <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>If they should request an Embassy to be sent to the great <HI>Cham,</HI> and there to make our Addresses; by no means agree to it, but promise them, if satisfacti|on be made of all things, to send a Honorable Embassy in recompence to his Majesty.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Coxingans</HI> are joyn'd in a League, and do not regard the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> as much as formerly, neither will make satisfaction, declare them both Enemies, and use Hostility to one as well as the other, by Burning and Ruining all places on the Main Continent of <HI>China:</HI> Then also Steer to the <HI>Chincheu</HI> Isles, and there endeavor to destroy the two Towns, <HI>Que</HI> and <HI>Aymuy.</HI> If there be a conveniency there for a strong Hold that might be kept by a small Garrison, to take it in Possession; for which purpose the Isle <HI>Kolong</HI> lies very convenient, and likewise the <HI>Piscadore's,</HI> but barren and unfertile, where also a Fort might be erected for our better Guard.</P>
<P>Not to accept to take any other place in possession, if you can get <HI>Tayowan</HI> again.</P>
<P>Endeavor to Conquer <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Tayowan</HI> by force of Arms, if it cannot be done by Peaceable means; yet take not so much Ground in possession as formerly.</P>
<P>The lower Castle of <HI>Zelandia</HI> being a good Garrison, would be a sufficient Defence against the Assaults of the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P>The upper Castle shall be Dismantled, and left ungarrison'd, that after|wards on farther Order it may be pull'd down, and build a strong Redoubt in its place.</P>
<P>To keep the Fort <HI>Provintia,</HI> and Garrison it with a hundred Men; as also that of <HI>Quelang.</HI></P>
<P>To begin somewhat in more safety in <HI>Tayowan,</HI> the Forces ought to be brought ashore through the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Lakge Moey</HI> on the main Land, and there
<PB N="115" REF="68">
first to Attaque and win the Fort <HI>Provincia,</HI> and likewise endeavor to get the Inhabitants there, to joyn with our People; to which purpose it will be re|quisite for you to take flat bottom'd Vessels from the <HI>Chineses,</HI> because our Boats cannot carry so many Men in those shallow Waters; neither could the requir'd Forces be brought ashore together; and if they wanted those Vessels, it would not be convenient to attempt any thing on that side, but be better be|hind <HI>Tonkoya,</HI> about six Leagues Southward of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> where in the Northern <HI>Mouson</HI> the Water is very smooth, and a higher Shore to break off the Winds.</P>
<P>From thence they should March up in two or three days by Land to the Fort <HI>Provincia</HI> at <HI>Sakkam;</HI> and besides the convenient Landing there, the Inhabitants of the South might perhaps joyn with the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> which if they should, all the <HI>Chineses</HI> in <HI>Formosa</HI> would not be able to withstand them.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Tartars</HI> should deny the Trade, and that those of the Isles <HI>Ay</HI> and <HI>Que|muy</HI> live apart from <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Tayowan,</HI> and are in friendship with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and also inclin'd to agree with you, do you likewise seem willing to it, nay, seek to joyn with them, provided they procure us those Articles demanded of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and use their assistance towards the regaining of <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Tayo|wan;</HI> nay, to fall upon the <HI>Tartars</HI> themselves, if occasion should require.</P>

<P>After the Admiral <HI>Balthazar Bort</HI> had on <HI>Iune</HI> the 30. <HI>Anno</HI> 1663. been con|ducted by several Friends aboard his Ship, he set Sail the next Morning three hours before Day, with all the Fleet, consisting in sixteen Men of War, and four Merchants, bound for <HI>Iapan,</HI> out of the Haven of <HI>Batavia,</HI> with a South East Wind, and running between the Isles of <HI>Hoorn</HI> and <HI>Edam,</HI> they stood to the North-East. At Noon, the Fleet had the Isle <HI>South-Wayter</HI> South West and by West three Leagues from them, in five Degrees and thirty Minutes Southern Latitude; in the Evening about Sun-set they had the Isle <HI>North-Wayter,</HI> about West-North-West, four Leagues distant.</P>
<P>The second at the usual Signal of a White Flag, and firing of a Gun, all the Commanders and Chief Officers of the <HI>Militia,</HI> came aboard the Admiral, who according to the Lord General, and <HI>Indian</HI> Councils Order, chose out of them all for his Privy Council the Persons under written, which the rest were to follow in Order, <HI>viz.</HI> next to the Admiral <HI>Balthazar Bort,</HI> who is to be always Chief: was</P>
<P><HI>Huybrecht de Lairesse,</HI> Vice-Admiral.</P>
<P><HI>William Volkersz,</HI> made Commander of those Ships that were to go to <HI>Iapan,</HI> and Rere-Admiral as long as he stay'd with the Fleet.</P>
<P><HI>Bartholomeus Verwei,</HI> who at <HI>Volkersz</HI> departure was to carry the Rere-Admi|ral's Flag; and in that Degree take place in the Council.</P>
<P><HI>Peter Coker,</HI> Master of the Admiral's Ship.</P>
<P><HI>Ernest Van Hogenhoek,</HI> Merchant in the <HI>Kogge.</HI></P>
<P>And the first Captain <HI>Christian Poolman,</HI> Commander of the <HI>Nut-Tree.</HI></P>
<P>These having taken their places, the Fleet was by them order'd to be divided into three Squadrons, as had already been consider'd by the Admiral, and approv'd of by the Vice-Admiral; and the Orders which the Fleet was to fol|low, being read were also affirm'd, and likewise the proportions of Diet was agreed on.</P>
<P>At Noon the Admiral was in four Degrees and five Minutes Southern Lati|tude, and had the <HI>High Island</HI> with the Trees, West-North-West, about seven Leagues from him.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="69">The third about day-break, they spy'd the Coast of <HI>Banka;</HI> at Noon they Sail'd Eastward of the Isle <HI>Lucipa;</HI> and in the Evening past within two Leagues and a half by the first Point of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> South and by East from them.</P>
<P>On <HI>Thursday,</HI> being the fifth, they saw the Mountain <HI>Monapyn,</HI> and were within two Leagues of the Shore of <HI>Sumatra;</HI> towards Evening, they Sail'd by the River <HI>Palimboang,</HI> and between <HI>Poele Tousjou,</HI> and <HI>Poele Sayo.</HI></P>
<P>The sixth, they saw the Isles <HI>Tousjou,</HI> and were at Noon in one Degree and sixteen Minutes South Latitude.</P>
<P>The seventh, the Fleet found <HI>Poele Sayo</HI> North-West and by West, about three Leagues and a half from them, in nineteen Minutes Southern Latitude; and in the Evening descry'd in the North the Isles which lay near <HI>Lingen.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> they discover'd <HI>Dominies Island,</HI> West-South-West, four Leagues from them; and crossing the Line, saw the <HI>High Isle</HI> of the <HI>Box-horns,</HI> about se|ven Leagues distant.</P>
<P>The ninth at Noon, the Admiral was in fifty four Minutes Northern Lati|tude, and in sight of the Isle <HI>Pangang,</HI> West and by North, about three Leagues and a half from him.</P>
<P>On the tenth appear'd the Isles <HI>Tinghy,</HI> North-West and by West, and <HI>Laver</HI> North and by West from them; in the Morning, the Fleet being near <HI>Laver,</HI> cast Anchor on the West side of it. <HI>Tymon</HI> hath no Wood, neither for Firing nor any other use, with which <HI>Laver</HI> is plentifully supply'd: This Isle is pretty high, and hath two rising Promontories, one on the South, and the other at the North end, which make a Plain in the middle.</P>
<P>The twelfth about Noon, five Ships upon the Admiral's Order set Sail from <HI>Laver</HI> to <HI>Poele Tymon,</HI> to take in Water, Fuel, and other Wood; and likewise to Barter for Provision, according to their agreement of the eleventh.</P>
<P>The Bay on the South-East Point of this Island lies very convenient for the fetching and taking in of fresh Water, Firing and other Wood, which is to be had ashore in great plenty; but Provision is somewhat scarce here, because the People of this Countrey have their Habitations more towards the South-West side; and also that which is to be had, is much dearer than at <HI>Poele Laver.</HI></P>
<P>The nineteenth, the Admiral about Sun-rising set Sail from <HI>Poele Tymon,</HI> and came in the afternoon to an Anchor, with the whole Fleet, by those Ships that were sent out before from <HI>Laver.</HI></P>
<P>The Fleet thus furnish'd with all Necessaries, Weigh'd Anchor on the twen|tieth about Day-break; and in the Evening had the Isle <HI>Poele Tymon,</HI> about four Leagues Southerly from them.</P>
<P>The one and twenty, they kept a Fast.</P>
<P>The twenty two, twenty three, twenty four, and twenty fifth, nothing hap|pen'd of any remark.</P>
<P>The twenty sixth, the Isles <HI>Candor</HI> bore Easterly about seven Leagues from the Fleet.</P>
<P>The twenty seventh, and twenty eighth, nothing happen'd, only a strong Gale of Wind blew from South-East out of the River <HI>Cambodia.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty ninth, the <HI>Finch</HI> Sailing before, made a sign that she saw Land, which was afterwards found to be the two Sand Hills on the Coast of <HI>Champan,</HI> about six Leagues Northerly from the Admiral; who in the Evening descry'd <HI>Poele Cecier de Mare,</HI> three Leagues in the South-South-East; and <HI>Cabo Cecier</HI> in the North-East and by North, three quarters of a League from them.</P>
<P>The thirtieth, the Bay of <HI>Padaran</HI> bearing West-North-West, they came by
<PB N="117" REF="69">
<HI>Avarella Falso</HI> about Noon, and were in twelve Degrees and seven Minutes Northern Latitude; their Course North and by East.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>August, Poele Cambir</HI> was East and by North from the Admiral, and in the afternoon the Isle <HI>Canton,</HI> North-North-East, about six Leagues.</P>
<P>The second, the private <HI>Iuncto</HI> being assembled, the Admiral read to them some peculiar Orders, chiefly about the putting in at the South of <HI>Tayowan</HI> with four or five Ships, and the manner how they should best get knowledge con|cerning the condition of their Enemies, according to his Excellencies Order in <HI>Batavia;</HI> and also in what time it was best to Cruise for their Jonks, that Sail richly Laden to and from <HI>Iapan;</HI> and likewise how they should dispose of those Jonks which they should take on the Coast of <HI>China, Manilhas, Makkaw, Tunking, Quinam, Ciam, Ligoor, Patany,</HI> and other places; and also of those which they might find in the Haven of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> and in the <HI>Piscadores.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, It was judg'd best to refer it till the next meeting, and in the mean time to give every one a Copy of it, as was perform'd by the Secretary on the fourth of the same Month; who also put in what was consider'd before|hand, and concluded on, That <HI>William Volkers,</HI> before his departure to <HI>Iapan,</HI> might see their resolution chiefly concerning the Cruising for <HI>Iapan</HI> Jonks, and giving an account of it to the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> there, they might make use thereof when occasion serv'd.</P>
<P>The fifth and sixth they saw the Isles <HI>Tinhosa,</HI> and <HI>Ainam;</HI> though <HI>Tinhosa</HI> lay five Leagues distant from the Admiral.</P>
<P>Mean while on the sixth, according to their last Intentions, an Order was made in the Council, concerning the written Proposals, and newly added Ob|servations, taken by the Admiral and Council at that time; of which every one had a Copy given them: which the better to understand, it is requisite that we also give a Transcript thereof, as follows:</P>
<P>The Admiral according to Order, when he came in sight of <HI>Formosa,</HI> sent four or five Ships to the Southermost Harbor of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> that there they might enquire some News; and first propos'd what Ships and Persons out of the Fleet might be fittest for that purpose; and if the <HI>Chinesys</HI> did not come aboard of their own accords, whereby they might attain to the desir'd Informati|on, they should put out a White Flag to invite them, or fire now and then a Gun; but if they could not attain their desire by these two means, they should send one or two Hostages, which they had brought with them from <HI>Ba|tavia,</HI> (which if they did no good, could do no harm;) and there ask the Go|vernors for whom they kept the Forts and Castles on <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa,</HI> whether for themselves, or together for those of <HI>Ey</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> or for the <HI>Tartar,</HI> as being his Subjects? and whether it were best to be done in writing or by word of Mouth?</P>
<P>If they should make answer to the foresaid Demand, and desire to know our Intention, whether it would not be convenient to intreat them to send some of their People with us to the greater part of the Fleet at the <HI>Piscadores,</HI> promising there to acquaint them with our Design. If they should be thereto inclin'd, leaving them Hostages, whether they should consent to it? Also how many days the Ships should stay on the South part of <HI>Tayowan?</HI> likewise if du|ring that time, they should use any Hostility, as taking of their Jonks and other Vessels, because the <HI>Indian</HI> Council had Commanded them to use none till they knew how they stood affected to the <HI>Tartars;</HI> but on the contrary, Commanded again, That nevertheless all <HI>Chinesy</HI> Jonks (from whence soever
<PB N="118" REF="70">
they came, and whither soever Bound) which they met withal in their Chan|nel, they should endeavor to take without any distinction, whether they be|long to the <HI>Tartars</HI> or <HI>Coxinga.</HI></P>
<P>And in regard the Intentions of their Excellencies in <HI>Batavia</HI> are declar'd to us, that we may take all <HI>Chinesy</HI> Jonks coming from other Countreys, if it would not be convenient to take out the Goods, whether Skins or ought else, and sending them for a tryal to <HI>Iapan,</HI> to see how the <HI>Iapanners</HI> would refent it, whether well or ill; and whether it relate only to the Jonks, on the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> or also to those which they might find on the Coast of the <HI>Manilhas, Mak|kau, Tunking, Quinam, Cambodia, Siam, Ligoor, Patany, Iohoor,</HI> and <HI>Formosa,</HI> which if they should not be set upon at our first coming thither, might easily escape from us.</P>
<P>On the contrary, they consider'd that the Enemy by such harsh actions might alter from their good Resolution, if perhaps they had any before, and then not suffer the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> to speak with them, much less freely proffer to surrender up <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa</HI> into our possession again, as their Excellencies would willingly have it: and to that purpose Commanded to take hold, and make good use of such an opportunity; otherwise, if the Enemy should make fair Promises, and thereby detain us from taking their Jonks, or doing ought else; when perhaps, being forc'd by sudden Invasions, they might sooner come to an agreement, and do what we should demand of them.</P>
<P>Therefore it was Propos'd, if they ought not to take all the Jonks and Ves|sels which they should find in the <HI>Piscadores,</HI> at the Admirals coming thither.</P>
<P>Secondly, Since their Excellencies had commanded to send peculiar Ships to Cruise up and down for the Jonks that Trade to <HI>Iapan,</HI> without expressing in what time it is best to be done; nay requir'd, that according to their Or|der, it should be done before <HI>William Volkerts</HI> went from the Fleet to <HI>Iapan,</HI> to carry News also thither concerning it, that in case ought should happen there he might govern himself accordingly; therefore the Admiral Propos'd, if it were best to be begun in the Southern or Northern <HI>Mouson;</HI> if in the Southern, the only time would be about the latter end of <HI>August,</HI> or the middle of <HI>Septem|ber,</HI> to get to the Northward of the <HI>Cape Sumber;</HI> and moreover, in the <HI>Iapan</HI> Sea, in which the foremention'd Jonks were best to be taken.</P>
<P>But then again was to be consider'd, the Cruisers would be forc'd to spend three or four Months, without any likelyhood of meeting with any Jonks; and likewise to consider, that the Ships aforemention'd would not be able to en|dure there long, if they should be surpris'd by Northerly Winds, want Water or Wood, and their Men happening to fall sick and die, which would force them to put into some Harbor or other; and also, that it was very uncertain, if by their Cruising they should meet with any thing, because that the <HI>Nether|land</HI> Ships could not always Sail in that Channel, for the Reasons aforemen|tion'd, which the <HI>Chineses</HI> use: Nay, if they should keep there continually, they might let them pass by in dark or misty Weather; and though the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ships did perhaps see some Jonks, yet they might loose them by their nimble Sailing: Adding moreover, that their Excellencies in this concern had thus exprest their opinion in the Orders which they had given to them: <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q>As We are inform'd, there may be more assurance made of those Trading Jonks that Sail to <HI>Iapan,</HI> than when they return in the Northern season, at which time it is very uncertain to wait for them, because they generally re|turn late in the Year, and Our Ships can scarce stay so long there.</Q>
<P><PB N="119" REF="70">But on the contrary, it is also to be observ'd, that if the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ships do not go at the foremention'd time, but later, they cannot get beyond the <HI>Cape de Sumber,</HI> and no likelihood to meet with any Jonks to the Southward of it, whereby we should be depriv'd of those rich Booties, that is to be had out of the <HI>Iapan</HI> Jonks; of which their Excellencies make mention in their Or|ders, saying,</P>
<Q>And since the richest Prizes are to be had out of the Trading Jonks which Sail to, and from <HI>Iapan,</HI> therefore it is requisite that you use your chiefest en|deavors about them, and send out expert Cruisers to frequent the North Pas|sage, and not the South of <HI>Cabo de Sumber,</HI> Sailing quite to the <HI>Iapan</HI> Sea.</Q>
<P>Provided this Cruising thus order'd, with hopes to take something, could be perform'd; yet there are no reasons to perswade us to it, for the uncertainties, if it must be perform'd by our Ships only, their Excellencies make mention of in these words:</P>
<Q>We put it to your consideration, if it would not be convenient to take two or three <HI>Chinesy</HI> Jonks that are good Sailers (which perhaps may fall in|to your hands on the Coast of <HI>China</HI>) along with you thither, thereby to de|ceive the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and the easier take their Trading Jonks, which Our Fri|gats, because of their sluggish Sailing, are scarce able to do, since We know the <HI>Chineses</HI> commonly out-Sail them.</Q>
<P>About this the Council ought chiefly to consider, if We had best undertake so uncertain a Design this Year, because the Fleet would not only be much weaken'd thereby, but also abated in its Power and Forces, when it should go against the Enemies; neither would they esteem nor regard us so much, as if we had all our Forces together; and we should also thereby be bereav'd of our nimblest and best Ships, which would be more assisting to us in all Affairs, than the biggest.</P>
<P>It may also happen, that falling on so many things together, nothing might be effected; therefore it ought to be consider'd, that all uncertain Designs which cannot be perform'd, without separating the Fleet be laid aside, and see what could be done to the Enemy with our whole Fleet together, and accord|ingly defer the sending of Ships out to Cruise up and down the Coast; the ra|ther, because in <HI>October, November,</HI> and <HI>December,</HI> it is better to get along the Shore to the Northward, as it happen'd to us the last Year; besides, their Ex|cellencies themselves have little hopes this Year to get any Jonks that come from <HI>Iapan,</HI> as by these following words more plainer appear, speaking of this concern in their Advice and Orders.</P>
<Q>And to be ready so soon, that We may take them in their going thither, is not to be done from hence; by which We should understand, that all other Designs ought to be laid aside, and begin first with Cruising; therefore to consider what number of Ships We shall send out to that purpose, and how they shall be Man'd; and also if they shall put into the Isles of <HI>Meaxi|ma, Gotto,</HI> and <HI>Koray,</HI> to enquire if there be no safe Harbors, Bays, and other conveniencies for Ships, that in time of need, they might make use of them according to their Excellencies Order, if it may be done without prejudice or hinderance.</Q>
<P>But it is again to be consider'd, that this Enquiry and Cruising cannot be done both in one season; and likewise to be suspected, that our Cruising Ships might be kept in the Havens aforemention'd by the <HI>Chineses;</HI> yet this might be excus'd in Stormy or Tempestuous Weather; however, We ought not to trust
<PB N="120" REF="71">
our Forces in their Hands; also that Cruising from <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> they might by Sayling along the Shore run beyond <HI>Cape de Sumber,</HI> nay, to <HI>Nanking,</HI> to see for convenient Havens and Bays, for the getting of Wood and fresh Water, of which in bad Weather, they might also make use, and at once take all those Jonks which they could meet with: On all which Proposals, they resolv'd and agreed as follows.</P>
<P>First, That the Admiral in person, according to his request, should go to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> with the <HI>Nut&punc;Tree, Vlaerdingen, Kogge, Sea-Hound,</HI> and <HI>Ionker,</HI> there to enquire concerning all Affairs, that on all accidents he might give speedy Or|der: If the <HI>Chineses</HI> do not come aboard of their own accords, he shall fire some Guns leasurely one after another, and also set up a <HI>Chieuw;</HI> if nothing be effected that way, to send the two <HI>Chinese</HI> Hostages, brought along with them from <HI>Batavia,</HI> (if they can get no Prisoners) ashore with Letters; by whom some Questions should be ask'd, <HI>viz.</HI> For whom they kept their Forts and Ca|stles in <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Tayowan?</HI> whether for themselves, or joyntly with those of <HI>Ey</HI> and <HI>Quemuy?</HI> or for the <HI>Tartars,</HI> as being their Subjects? with promises, if they should truly answer them, that then the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> would also declare their Intentions; if thus they obtain'd their desire, the Admiral shall ask them to send some of their People along with him to the rest of the Fleet at the <HI>Pis|cadores,</HI> with promise, there to declare his Design, without leaving any of our Men as Hostages in their custody. If they are not inclin'd thereto, the Ad|miral shall do what time and convenience shall advise him to: For the per|formance of which, he shall only spend two or three days, in which time no Hostility shall be us'd ashore; but nevertheless, not only endeavor to make Prize of all Vessels there, but also in the <HI>Piscadores.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the second Proposal about Cruising for the Jonks in the <HI>Iapan</HI> Channel, It is thought fit that it be undertaken after the business be done at <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> if they are not prevented by receiving satisfaction for their sustain'd In|juries. But if they should not, then to wave their Cruising so long in the South|ern <HI>Mouson,</HI> but return to the Enemies chief Towns and Places; and Sailing to the North with the whole Fleet, do all the Damage possible, both by Sea and Land, and then against the time comes, to send the Merchant <HI>Ernest Van Hogenbook</HI> as Admiral with three of the best Sailers, Man'd as they were at that present, and three nimble Jonks (if they could be Masters of so many be|twixt that time) to Cruise beyond <HI>Cabo de Sumber,</HI> nay, if possible, as far as <HI>Nanking,</HI> that in their way thither, they might seek for some convenient Bays and Harbors wherein Ships might be safe in bad Weather, and be furnish'd with Water and Wood. Moreover, to flie up and down in thirty two and thir|ty three Degrees, and seize on all Ships they could light upon. They should also for that purpose, put in at the Isles <HI>Meaxima, Gotto,</HI> and <HI>Koray,</HI> provided they could do it without prejudice, according to their Excellencies Order in <HI>Batavia:</HI> In performance of which also, the Cruisers should again come to the Fleet, either at <HI>Ey, Quemuy,</HI> or <HI>Formosa</HI> in <HI>February,</HI> that then with all their Forces they might undertake such Adventures as should be thought con|venient.</P>
<P>The two chief Articles aforemention'd thus agreed on, it was also thought fit, after their former refusal, to Sail with the foremention'd Ships from <HI>Pe|dro Blanko</HI> to <HI>Formosa,</HI> towards the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Tankoya,</HI> so to reach the South Harbor of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> and Anchor there; and likewise although <HI>William Volkerts,</HI> Admiral for the <HI>Iapan</HI> Merchants, had purpos'd with his Ships to proceed on his Voy|age
<PB N="121" REF="71">
from <HI>Pedro Blanco</HI> along the Coast of <HI>China</HI> to <HI>Iapan;</HI> yet the whole Fleet consisting of twenty Sail should first appear in sight of <HI>Formosa&punc;</HI> and that then three of the <HI>Iapan</HI> Ships should go on without the <HI>Ankeveen,</HI> between <HI>Formosa</HI> and the <HI>Piscadores,</HI> and the Vice-Admiral with the remaining twelve Ships, should immediately Sail to the <HI>Piscadores,</HI> and there stay and expect the Admi|ral with his five Ships; but if bad Weather, all the Men of War should go to the <HI>Piscadores,</HI> and the three Vessels that were bound for <HI>Iapan,</HI> without staying any longer by the Fleet, proceed on their Voyage.</P>
<P>The same day, according to agreement, the Admiral set Sail with his five Ships, the <HI>Nut-Tree, Vlaerdingen, Kogge, Sea-Hound,</HI> and <HI>Ionker</HI> to <HI>Formosa,</HI> to|wards the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Tonkayo,</HI> from thence to steer for the South Harbor of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> and there drop Anchor.</P>
<P>The eighth, the <HI>Sea-Hound</HI> and <HI>Ionker</HI> return'd from their fruitless chasing of a Jonk, since the sixt, which in calm Weather had escap'd them, taking only a <HI>Chinese Champan,</HI> in which the <HI>Ionker</HI> had five Men wounded, and the <HI>Sea-Hound</HI> one.</P>
<P>The Politick <HI>Chineses</HI> first set adrift a Pot with <HI>Arak</HI> in a Tub&punc; and after|wards a <HI>Chinese</HI> Water-Vessel, on which stood a Cane with a Letter; and lastly, the aforemention'd <HI>Champan,</HI> which was taken by the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> but the Pot with <HI>Arak</HI> the Commanders would not permit the Seamen to take up.</P>
<P>Whilst the <HI>Sea-hound</HI> and <HI>Ionker</HI> were yet busie chasing the foremention'd Jonk, they spy'd another under Sail, toward which, accompany'd with the Vice-Admiral and his whole Squadron, they made with all the Sail they could possible; and soon after the Admirals Sloop was put out Arm'd with six Blunderbusses, and other Necessaries of War, and Man'd with the Boats Crue, be|ing twelve Soldiers, one Ensign, and a Corporal, all Commanded by his Pilot.</P>
<P>In the taken Jonk, which on the tenth was brought close aboard the Admi|ral, they found seven small Guns, Sythes, Pikes, a parcel of Fire-Balls and Arrows, and likewise good store of Gun-Powder and other Ammunition; the rest of the Lading consisted in several kinds of Wood.</P>
<P>The Admiral first caus'd some of the <HI>Chineses</HI> to be mildly examin'd, then threatning, that if they would not speak the truth, they should die for it; to which purpose a Soldier was put behind one of them with a naked Sword, and then ask'd, To what intention they ply'd there, yet (partly supposing, that they would not confess, and partly, because the Interpreters could not well under|stand what they said) they could get but a slender account from them; but that which they agreed in most was, that they belong'd to the <HI>Tartar,</HI> and with twenty Jonks had carry'd <HI>Tartar</HI> Soldiers from <HI>Canton</HI> to the Island <HI>Ainan,</HI> to re|inforce the Garrison, and had now been in company with five of the same Jonks in their way towards <HI>Canton;</HI> besides, they made mention of their Pass, which the Vice-Roy of <HI>Canton</HI> had given them to that purpose, and deliver'd it to the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> which were not able to understand it: At this time the Admiral was about the <HI>Craeke Deep,</HI> off from the <HI>Makaw</HI> Island.</P>
<P>The eleventh, the Council being assembled by the Admiral, caus'd the two Commanders of the taken Jonks, nam'd, <HI>Onghing,</HI> and <HI>Ongkeeyn,</HI> to be brought before them and examin'd; but could learn nothing from them, but what agreed with that which their People had told two days before, <HI>viz.</HI> that they had carry'd Soldiers from <HI>Canton</HI> to <HI>Ainan,</HI> and were now on their return; and reply'd when ask'd, That <HI>Coxinga</HI> had been dead a year, and that his Son <HI>Kim|sia</HI> had the chief Command in <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa;</HI> but how it was with the
<PB N="122" REF="72">
Wars between the <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Chineses</HI> they knew not. When ask'd if they knew the <HI>Champan</HI> taken by the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> of the second instant, and now be|hind the Admiral's Stern; they answer'd, after having see it, <HI>Yes,</HI> and that it belong'd to <HI>Canton;</HI> but if the Jonk to which it belong'd came along with them from <HI>Ainan,</HI> they could not resolve.</P>
<P>The Letter which they found also in the said Jonk was given them to read; but they gave another construction than the former: Neither could the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> be rightly inform'd of the Contents, because their Interpretors could not explain it; so that in stead of satisfaction, they found themselves more per|plex'd than before.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Admiral desir'd the Council to consider if these shaven <HI>Chi|neses,</HI> with their Jonk and <HI>Cargo,</HI> since they had shew'd no manner of Hosti|lity to the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> ought to be clear'd and discharg'd, or if it were bet|ter to be sure by taking them along with the Fleet to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and put their free|dom to be judg'd by <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi</HI> Chief Governors there; or if by tor|tures, they should make a farther examination.</P>
<P>Which being consulted on, it was suppos'd that by tortures they might perhaps draw from them the truth, and what the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> expected, <HI>viz.</HI> That they were of <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Party, and Sail'd with false Passes, and yet be sent out by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and be under their jurisdiction, whom by the taking of these Jonks, they ought no ways to displease; the more, because their Ex|cellencies Order in <HI>Batavia,</HI> concerning the taking of Jonks, was not specifi'd to relate to those which Sail'd to places that belong'd to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> but those that drove a Trade to <HI>Iapan:</HI> But because this Jonk thus prepar'd for Piracy was much suspected, and also the rough entertainment which they had from the small Vessel, six of their Men being Wounded, they resolv'd after consideration to declare the Jonk with the foremention'd Goods, and all her Men free Prize, and carry them to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> there to make further inquiry concerning the truth. This being told them, they seem'd to be satisfi'd, only fearing at their return to be taken by <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Jonks.</P>
<P>In the Morning about Day-break, the Fleet had the North-Point of <HI>Ilha dos Viados,</HI> or the Island <HI>Lemas</HI> North and by West, two Leagues and a half from them.</P>
<P>About Noon, the <HI>Nut-Tree, Cogge, Zierikzee, Overveen, Naerden,</HI> and <HI>Mars,</HI> came at the firing of some Guns, from the Admiral to an Anchor, on the North-side of <HI>Lemas,</HI> within Cannon shot of the Shore. A good distance be|hind the Admiral, they saw the <HI>Bucksloot</HI> and <HI>Nieuwendam</HI> also lying at Anchor. So on the twenty ninth, the Admiral came with ten Ships safe to an Anchor, in the Road of <HI>Hoksieu;</HI> the rest of the Fleet were order'd to Sail to the Bay of <HI>Tenhay,</HI> and the <HI>Good Fortune</HI> soon after sent notice of her arrival by Letters to the Governor of the Castle <HI>Minjazeen,</HI> lying at the Mouth of the River <HI>Hoksieu;</HI> and likewise to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong,</HI> and General <HI>Lipovi.</HI></P>
<P>The twentieth of <HI>October,</HI> after long stay, and many Consultations, con|cerning the Commencing the War against the <HI>Coxingans,</HI> the Vice-Admiral <HI>Hui|bert de Laresse,</HI> and <HI>Hogenbook</HI> came aboard the Admiral again at <HI>Soanchefoe,</HI> with a Letter from the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong,</HI> containing these words.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Singlamong</HI>'s Letter to the Admiral&punc;</HEAD>
<P>YOu are come hither from a remote Countrey, with mighty Ships, to serve Our Empe|ror, which is a certain Sign of your good Inclinations. How shall We return Kindnesses sufficient to such your Deserts? It is needless to shew Thankfulness for the small Trisles sent you. You write to have it Seal'd, what hath pass'd between us: But how can I possibly do it? because you (if it be onely Written in Our Language) cannot un|derstand it. Therefore I desire you to let the Business of the War be written in Paper, both in the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongues, and send it to Me, that I may also rightly appre|hend it.</P>
<P>When We together shall have regain'd the Isles of <HI>Ay</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> We will joyn Our Ionks and Forces to your Ships, to set upon <HI>Tayowan,</HI> and so utterly root out their whole Party.</P>
<P>It is most true, that Our Emperor will requite the good Service which you have done to this Empire, by permitting you a free Trade; for I and the General <HI>Lipovi</HI> will write expresly about it to his Imperial Majesty.</P>
<P>The Ionk which you desire to carry News to <HI>Batavia,</HI> shall be sent you, when you please to advise Us, whether you will have it Mann'd with <HI>Tartars</HI> or <HI>Hollanders:</HI> We desire you to employ none of your Ships in it, that your Forces may not be weakned, because they will be wanting in the War. If you please, We desire you to stay a little longer before you depart; for I expect an Answer from <HI>Lipovi,</HI> which so soon as I have, We will ap|point the day. This is in short an Answer to your Letter; for all things cannot so well be express'd on Paper.</P>

</LIST>
<P>About these Articles, as the Admiral was inform'd by Letters of the twen|ty third from <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Hoogenhoek,</HI> the Vice-Roy made great scruple, saying, That he could not sign them, before he had made the General <HI>Lipovi,</HI> and the Emperors Deputies in <HI>Chinchieu,</HI> acquainted with the seventh and eighth Arti|cles, and had their Approbation concerning them, which at farthest within two or three days, on the Word of a King, should be perform'd; to which purpose he had already sent the foremention'd Articles, written by the <HI>Nether|landers</HI> in form of an Agreement, by Post to <HI>Chinchieu.</HI> And likewise the other Ar|ticles, especially that of <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa,</HI> which upon the taking of it with joynt Forces, should be left in possession of the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> was already grant|ed without contradiction by the Vice-Roy. Nay, he had protested to them, That upon the taking of <HI>Ay</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> the free and unmolested Trade through all the Empire of <HI>China</HI> should not onely be granted to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> for a few years, but for ever, for which he would stand oblig'd; onely he de|sir'd them to stay the foremention'd three or four days, as we said; when they answering, told the Vice-Roy, That in that Point they could not satisfie his desire; but that one thing or other thereof must be Seal'd: He again re|peated what he declar'd before.</P>
<P>The twenty third the Admiral sent <HI>Lairesse,</HI> and the Rere-Admiral <HI>Bartholo|mew Verwei</HI> ashore, with Order to go with <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Hoogenhoek</HI> to the Vice-Roy, and desire him to Sign and Seal the Covenant for performance of all those foremention'd Articles, and also for that of the Free Trade, which his Highness had granted; and then declare to him, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> would at present be satisfied with it, and stay the limited three or four days for the granting of that Article concerning <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy;</HI> but that in the mean time he would be pleas'd to hasten the sending of the Jonk which was to be dispatch'd for <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty sixth the <HI>Vlaerdingen, Nut-tree, Tertolen, Naerden, Mars, Zierikzee, Flushing,</HI> and the <HI>Cogge,</HI> being under the Rere-Admiral <HI>Bartholomew Verwei</HI> his Squadron, set Sail from before the River <HI>Soanchieuw,</HI> steering directly for Cape <HI>Tsombou.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty seventh a Servant came with the Interpreter <HI>Melman</HI> from his Highness <HI>Singlamong,</HI> who had himself been with the General <HI>Lipovi,</HI> and brought the long-expected Seal'd Agreement; as also two Letters, one from the Vice-Roy, and another from the General.

<HEAD>The Letter writ to the Admiral by the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> was to this purpose.</HEAD>
<P>THe last Year you were sent hither from the King of <HI>Batavia,</HI> and came with your Ships before <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and have acquainted by Letters and Word of mouth, That you come to serve Our Empire, and assist Us against <HI>Coxinga,</HI> which We have already made known to his Majesty at <HI>Peking.:</HI> And seeing you resolve to be fully satisfied and reveng'd to the height for all the Losses you have sustain'd, and never to desist until you have utterly extirpa|ted those Pyrates, therefore We have been the more earnest in Our Sollicita|tion: And since you are come hither again this Year to the same purpose, to joyn with Us, We have read your Letter, which We receiv'd some days since, concerning the War, with the Government and Order thereof, which We shall observe when We come to engage with the Enemy; but We find thereby, that you make more Proposals than the last Year, and those such as I and <HI>Lipovi</HI> (though Chief Governors of this Territory) cannot conclude on, before we have made it known to the Emperor, and receiv'd his Approbation. As to what concerns those things for which We have receiv'd Orders and Command from the Emperor to conclude with you heretofore, We have sent you in this Letter, and they shall also be strictly observ'd by Us.</P>

<P>TWo days since I receiv'd <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s and your Letter concerning the Agreement to be concluded between you and Us, which I have strict|ly perus'd; but finding some weighty Articles in it, I thought it not conve|nient to answer your Proposals. It is true, I am plac'd by the Emperor here as Chief Commander; yet I am not impower'd to treat about such Affairs, according to my desire; but must first acquaint his Majesty with it, and ex|pect his Confirmation: But I have very well understood your desire, and you must expect an Answer to your Business from the Court at <HI>Peking,</HI> whi|ther I have already sent a Letter. As to your going with Our Ships to <HI>Ey|muy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy, Singlamong</HI> will acquaint you with Our Intentions, and give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ou order concerning all things else.

You request also three Pilots, which <HI>Singlamong</HI> will dispatch to you.

<P>This Seal'd Writing, being compar'd with that sent by the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> to his Highness, to be Seal'd by him, was found to differ in the principal Arti|cles, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The taking possession of the Isles of <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> was not mention'd, but left out.</P>
<P>No mention was also made, That if they conquer'd, then they would go with them to <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the Free Trade through the whole Empire, and also to get the Emperor to ratifie their Agreement, they express'd thus: <Q>That upon the Conquering the Isles of <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> the <HI>Hollanders</HI> should be receiv'd into the Emperors Subjection, and that his Majesty should acknowledge their Assistance, and grant their Request, to which <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi</HI> would be means that it should be perform'd.</Q></P>
<P>Besides, although the King and Councils Writing agreed for the most part with that of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> yet they had inserted many new things, about the carrying of their Flags, and other unnecessary Matters.</P>
<P>The last Exception was, That the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s Letter was sign'd with his Seal; but <HI>Lipovi</HI>'s was not.</P>
<P>The Admiral <HI>Bort,</HI> in Answer to their Highnesses <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi,</HI> writ back, with an Account of what Flags and Colours the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> us'd to carry, and should carry in that Expedition, as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>BEsides the Letter from your Highness and the General <HI>Lipovi,</HI> I also re|ceiv'd yesterday the Result made in your Highness Assembly about Our Business, in which we are permitted to sell those Commodities at this time onely which We brought along with Us, being but few, and such as Captain <HI>Nobel</HI> can at any time give your Highness an Inventory of: We accept of this Grant, provided it may be forthwith publish'd, as well here in <HI>Soanchieuw,</HI> as <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and made known to the People by divulging the Proclamation; and that Captain <HI>Nobel</HI> may go about it to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and there at his coming open his <HI>Cargoes,</HI> and expose the Goods to sale. And though this be but a small Requital for the great Service which We intend to do, yet We will firmly hope and believe, That his Imperial Majesty hereafter will not refuse to grant us a Free Trade for ever, through his whole Empire, it being onely what agrees with his Royal Bounty, to requite all such who to their great Charge come to his Service. We declare, That Our Fleet of Ships stands Our Masters in above a hundred thousand <HI>Taile</HI> to fit out, and forty thousand <HI>Taile</HI> a Month to maintain: That Fleet which return'd last Year with ill success to <HI>Batavia,</HI> cost also a great Sum of Money, which your Highness must needs be sensible of, and likewise what damage We sustain'd by the loss of two Ships that came to his Imperial Majesties Service. If therefore the Sale of those few Goods which We have brought along with Us, can make any satisfaction for the great Charges which We have already been at, We leave to your Highness consideration. Therefore We cannot but be still importunate in our first Request, That the Free Trade may be ratified to Us for ever through the whole Empire, and Writings seal'd in confirmation thereof.</P>

<P>Yet We are confident that your Highness will be so favorable as to pro|cure what We so oft and so long have requested; upon which account We are ready and willing to venture Our Lives and Fortunes for the Emperor, and use Our uttermost Endeavors to ruine that avaritious and insulting Py|rate, so We stand ready to joyn Our Forces with yours, desiring all celerity in the Expedition, and that the time for Our setting Sail from <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy</HI> may be appointed and publish'd, because the time limited for Us to be there, by Our General and Council, is already past.</P>
<P>There are yet some Prisoners of Ours, whom We desire your Highness to remember, and to send them to Us, if you hear where they are, or find them.

the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in the Haven of <HI>Schoeni,</HI> and if Wind and Weather serve, to set forth with your Ships the same day, and set Sail to the Bay of <HI>Wettauw.</HI> Let five of your best Sailers, that draw least Water, go before with Our nimblest Jonks, and so run into the Haven of <HI>Wettauw;</HI> and the remaining ten Ships, with Our great Jonks, Anchor in the Mouth of the Harbor. If We should meet with any of the Enemies Jonks in the Bay of <HI>Wettauw,</HI> as also in the Haven of <HI>Kinsakia,</HI> as We may expect, let us joyntly assail them.</P>
<P>Concerning your Landing on the Enemies Coasts, <HI>Bethetok</HI> and I have re|solv'd about it, which must be known onely to us two; but We will give you timely notice thereof.</P>
<P>I have order'd the Agent to bring me the List of the Merchandises which you have brought along with you, and I will send them by him to the Go|vernor of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> with Orders to him to sell them in Publick, to which pur|pose the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">An Officer belong|ing to the City.</NOTE> <HI>Conbon</HI> will be very serviceable.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>Nobel</HI> also brought a Letter from the General <HI>Lipovi,</HI> in answer to that which the Admiral had sent to him, containing the following Lines.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe twenty ninth of this ninth Moon I receiv'd your Letter, and per|us'd the Contents of it, taking notice of the several distinctions of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Flags and Colours, which We have approv'd, and at this instant acquainted Our Officers with, and order'd them to govern themselves ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>You are here sent from your King in <HI>Batavia,</HI> with your Ships, to assist and sail with us to <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy:</HI> Therefore We believe that you will shew your Valour, in setting upon the Enemies Countreys and Vessels, that when they are Conquer'd, you may return with Honor to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and there give an Account of your Adventures to your King, That here you have ob|tain'd your long wish'd for Desire of Free Trade, for which you have come hither two Years.</P>
<P>You write that We should send you Letters of Assurance, that you might for ever Trade through all this Empire, besides the appointing you conveni|ent Houses and Places; which is not possible to be granted, till we are im|power'd from his Majesty at <HI>Peking,</HI> to whom I have already writ concern|ing it, who by this time understands your Requests: But as for those Wares which you have brought with you, you may dispose thereof at your pleasure. But after the Conquest of <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> when you shall return with Us again to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> We shall by that time have, We hope, a pleasing Answer to all your other desires, from the Emperor.</P>
<P>You propose also, That if any of your Countrey-men, being Prisoners with the Enemy, should fall into Our Hands, we would not kill them; which We not onely promise, but further also, that We will send them to you; and to that purpose I have already strictly commanded both My Of|ficers and Soldiers. The day on which the Ships shall set Sail with Our Jonks, <HI>Singlamong</HI> will privately advise you.</P>

<P>The eleventh the Admiral Sail'd out of the Mouth of the River <HI>Soanchieuw,</HI> and with three Ships, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Nut-Tree, Cinnamon-Tree,</HI> and <HI>Yonker,</HI> he came to the Cape of <HI>Sombou,</HI> although not followd by the <HI>Tartar</HI> Jonks. The Rere-Admiral <HI>Verwei,</HI> who had since the twenty sixth lain in the River <HI>Soanchefoe,</HI> set Sail also from thence with three Ships, the <HI>Vlaerdingen, Naerden,</HI> and <HI>Sea-hound.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="77">The thirteenth the Admiral was inform'd by Letters from <HI>Tonganpek,</HI> That his Jonks were the day before come out of the River of <HI>Soanchefoe,</HI> into the Bay of <HI>Schoeni;</HI> and that Morning a Letter was brought to him from the Ad|miral <HI>Matitoe</HI> (who three days before was gone to the Cape of <HI>Wattauw</HI>) in which he was advis'd, That he should be with all the Jonks of the Realm at <HI>Wattauw</HI> on the fourteenth day of that Moon, and also acquaint the <HI>Holland</HI> Admiral with it, that he might Sail thither with his Ships.</P>
<P>According to this Advice from <HI>Tonganpek,</HI> and also perceiving the Jonks sail|ing before, the Admiral set sail with fourteen Ships from the Cape of <HI>Sombou</HI> to that of <HI>Puthay,</HI> behind which he came to an Anchor about the Evening, in nine Fathom Water.</P>
<P>Here <HI>Iacob Gommers,</HI> Commander of the <HI>Zierikzee,</HI> came aboard the Admiral, bringing with him one of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Prisoners, call'd <HI>Maurice Ianzen Vis,</HI> born in <HI>Mauritius-Isle,</HI> who not long before was taken by the Enemy <HI>Coxingans,</HI> and by them sent to the <HI>Netherlanders:</HI> He also deliver'd the Admiral a Letter from the Enemy, dated the tenth Instant, written by <HI>Summimpesiou,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Sioubontok,</HI> the second or next Person to the young <HI>Coxin Kimsia,</HI> who had the Supreme Command over the Isles of <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> and other Islands lying thereabouts. The Letter was to this effect.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>Summimpesiou,</HI> alias <HI>Sioubontok,</HI> Commander and Governor of <HI>Quemuy,</HI> sends this Letter to the Chief Commander of the <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet.</HEAD>
<P>YOu have understood and know, that <HI>Coxinga</HI> two Years ago conquer'd <HI>Tayowan,</HI> which formerly was his Native Countrey.</P>
<P>This was done because he was forc'd to provide a Settlement and strong Fortress for his Soldiers, which he us'd in his War against the <HI>Tartar.</HI></P>
<P>And two Years since <HI>Coxinga</HI> coming to <HI>Formosa,</HI> at <HI>Sakkam, Iacob Valencyn</HI> surrendred upon these Articles, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> should be alotted a Place in <HI>Sakkam,</HI> or elsewhere, to go on with their Trade, and settle their Facto|ry in.</P>
<P>As to what concerns the <HI>Tartars,</HI> they are very much disabled, and their Forces so broken, that they have lost the Territories <HI>Huquan</HI> and <HI>Nanquin;</HI> therefore they have desir'd you to make War upon Us with your Ships, as We are inform'd; which We fear not, having Soldiers enough, all indispu|tably valiant: As for your Ships, they are very large, but draw a great deal of Water; so that they cannot penetrate the River, but must always live at Sea. You also know very well, that when We were in <HI>Tayowan</HI> We were stor'd with Soldiers, and Ammunition; therefore have a care of your selves, that these Eastern <HI>Tartars</HI> deceive you not; for they are cowardly and deceitful, as you perhaps will find too soon, when you shall see, that in the Battel, and in the greatest need, they will forsake you, shifting basely for themselves: But admit they should stand stoutly, they will always be ca|villing; sometimes they will pretend, that you have not assisted them as you ought, but that in all their Engagements they were forc'd to resist <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Forces alone: Nay, if you should conquer us, which we no ways fear, they will never grant you a setled Factory; for <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi</HI> have assur'd Us, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> should never obtain a Free Trade in <HI>China,</HI> if We would come in. And besides, the Emperor in <HI>Peking</HI> hath not so much as once heard of your Business; for if he did, he would never put you upon a War against Us; therefore I advise you in good time to look to your selves,
<PB N="131" REF="77">
nor Engage for a false Friend against so potent an Enemy: for your Ships, of which you boast so much, are rather for Burthen than War: and if you come to Traffick with us, then know, that the Coasts you intend for have many Rocks, Sands and Shelves, where your Ships may easily suffer. But in <HI>Tayo|wan</HI> we have Sugar, Deer-skins, and other Merchandises which you desire, in far greater abundance: therefore if you will turn your Business to a friendly Commerce, intimate your Intentions to <HI>Kimsia,</HI> and he will provide a Place for your Merchants, and a Harbor for your Ships. I have with yours sent some of our Men to you to know further your Mind; and if you desire to Treat with me about any thing, send three of your Men to me, and we will first consult: we will send you aboard <HI>Valencine</HI>'s Wife, your Minister <HI>Leo|nard</HI> with his Wife, and all the other Prisoners. What we Write is plain, but serious, not ambiguous, and free from all dissimulation. The <HI>Hollander Assam</HI> was Interpreter two years since in <HI>Sakkam</HI> to <HI>Iacob Valencin,</HI> therefore I have sent him with this Letter to declare to you all things, and to acquaint you with the condition of our Affairs.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The Commander, <HI>Iacob Gommers-back,</HI> sent in Writing by the same <HI>Champan</HI> which brought <HI>Maurice,</HI> an Answer to the young <HI>Coxin,</HI> That neither he nor his Officers could give any Answer upon it; but that they must first acquaint their Admiral with it, and have his Order: therefore it would be requisite for his Highness to send a <HI>Coya</HI> with Oars to him, to carry the Messenger (by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Assam,</HI> and by the <HI>Netherlanders, Maurice</HI>) to receive his Answer on their Proposals.</P>
<P>This <HI>Maurice Ianzen Vis</HI> inform'd the Admiral and his Councel, as well of his own accord as by Examination, That the Enemy was five or six thousand strong in the Island <HI>Eymuy,</HI> and that there were no other Castles or strong Holds, but one round Stone Wall, without Batteries or Guns: That the Island <HI>Lissoe</HI> was inhabited onely by Rusticks, and that the Enemy had no Fortifications there; but on the Island <HI>Goutsoe</HI> was a small Castle: That <HI>Anpontek</HI> Command|ded in <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Tayowan,</HI> yet lived on <HI>Sakkam,</HI> which was no way fortifi'd: That in the Castle there were no Soldiers, nor any but <HI>Coxin</HI>'s Wives and Chil|dren: That the <HI>Militia</HI> were Quarter'd all about the Countrey, yet much decrea|sed by divers running away, and many cut off daily by the <HI>Formosan</HI> King <HI>Mid|dag;</HI> for neither he nor the People of the Mountains would submit to the <HI>Chinese</HI> Government; but all the Villages did: That before <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy</HI> lay about eighty great, and twenty ordinary Jonks with Soldiers; moreover, above two hundred and sixty Jonks Unarm'd, in which their Women and Children, and Housholdstuff, had their abodes: Lastly, that the Towns on <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy</HI> were most of them deserted, and the <HI>Chineses</HI> preparing to flie to <HI>Formosa.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Intelligence the Admiral and his Councel conceiv'd, that their dilatoriness about the Islands would strengthen <HI>Formosa,</HI> all the rest flying thi|ther, which by all means ought to be prevented. Hereupon it was thought convenient and concluded, to send the Vice-Admiral and Captain <HI>Poleman</HI> as authoriz'd Persons, to <HI>Tonganpek,</HI> General of the <HI>Tartar</HI> Fleet, lying at the <HI>Cape of Pathany,</HI> to demand of him peremptorily, If he did not intend with all his Jonks and Forces that very day, to joyn and set Sail with them, and so together fall upon the Enemy: which if he refus'd, then tell to him, That they would
<PB N="132" REF="78">
undertake the Work themselves. And that it might appear they dealt upright|ly, <HI>Maurice Ianzen</HI> was sent with the two Captains to acquaint him, That they had Overtures of Peace from <HI>Summimpessiou,</HI> yet they would not desist from their Intentions.</P>
<P>But they returning told the Admiral, That he was very unwilling to Engage till he heard from <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi,</HI> and therefore desir'd three or four days respite, alledging that it was not according to the Agreement, which was, That they should assail the Enemy together: but if they would go, then to leave two or three Ships for their Convoy to follow them.</P>
<P>The fifteenth he sent a <HI>Mandarin</HI> with Letters to the Admiral, persisting in his former Desire, that he would please to tarry but two days longer. But the Admiral suspecting delays, and the change of their Councels, and that the time expir'd they might have other Orders, pitcht upon the next day to set forward with eight Ships to <HI>Quemuy,</HI> and to leave seven small Frigats to con|duct them; of which they sent him word by his own <HI>Mandarin;</HI> desiring also, that for the more easie Landing of their Men they lend them twenty five of their <HI>Coya's,</HI> or small Boats.</P>
<P>In the Evening the <HI>Hollanders</HI> espy'd fifty or sixty little <HI>Tartar</HI> Jonks and <HI>Coya's</HI> to stand directly for <HI>Quemuy,</HI> to whom the Admiral immediately sent his Lieutenant <HI>Hendrick van Dalen,</HI> with the Interpreter <HI>Iohn Melman,</HI> to demand the reason thereof, and why they Sail'd thither? to which they return'd an|swer, That the <HI>Tartars</HI> had that Night taken a <HI>Coya</HI> with three Men from the Enemy, who inform'd them that there were many more at <HI>Quemuy,</HI> therefore they had sent out those <HI>Coya's</HI> to watch their motion; adding moreover, that the next Morning they were to come again to the Fleet.</P>
<P>The sixteenth about Day-break they saw the same Vessels according as they told them, returning from <HI>Quemuy,</HI> but seem'd to be a greater Fleet; to meet whom, upon a Signal, many more Boats set out from the <HI>Tartars</HI> by fifteeen or sixteen in a Company, which might easily be discern'd very much to decrease the Fleet; and observing they went all of them thither full of People, and re|turn'd in a manner empty, they were jealous that the <HI>Tartar</HI> either had, or would privately agree with the Enemy: whereupon they chang'd their in|tention, and resolv'd to wait another day for the <HI>Tartar</HI> Fleet, whilst they sent to them to be better satisfi'd concerning the former Passages.</P>
<P>In the afternoon a <HI>Mandarin,</HI> chose by <HI>Tonganpek,</HI> brought the twenty five <HI>Coya's</HI> to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet, with a Letter to the Admiral, desiring some farther de|lay; but he not altering his resolution, distributed the <HI>Tartar</HI> Vessels amongst his Fleet as he saw fit: and immediately the Admiral and the Councel agreed, that the next Morning he should Sail from thence with eight Ships to the South Point of the Island <HI>Quemuy;</HI> and in the mean time the Rere-Admiral <HI>Bartholo|mew Verwei</HI> should with his Ship and the other small Frigats, being seven in number, stay with the <HI>Tartar</HI> Fleet, and Sail with them towards <HI>Quemuy;</HI> but if the General <HI>Tonganpek</HI> did not follow the Admiral with all his Forces within five days, that then the Vice-Admiral, no longer delaying, should follow to joyn with the Admiral, that so together they might fall upon the Service, the better to endamage the Enemy. Mean while came another Letter from <HI>Singlamong</HI> the Vice-Roy, to the Admiral, by all means desiring him to tarry a little longer; but he persisting, and not enduring delays, the next day with his Ships reaching to <HI>Erasmus Bay,</HI> the twenty five <HI>Coya's</HI> running in, lay behind the <HI>North-Foreland:</HI> the Admiral not doubting but that the <HI>Tartars</HI> would
<PB N="133" REF="78">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
follow him, Sail'd nearer the City; and about ten a Clock the next Morning anchor'd before the great City <HI>Quemuy:</HI> where after some difficulty in chusing their Ground, the rest of their Fleet being now joyn'd with the other seven, Rode as near the City as they could: then the Admiral sent some Boats to discover fit Landing-places, with Orders also, that if they saw any conveni|ence to Land a Party; which <HI>Coker</HI> their Captain perform'd, putting ashore fourscore Men; but the <HI>Chineses</HI> coming out of the City gave them a smart <HI>Camisado:</HI> yet the <HI>Hollanders</HI> behav'd themselves so well, that they put the Enemy, though twice their number, to flight with the loss of one Man, and some few wounded. During this Skirmish, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> having gotten some Ground, and the <HI>Chineses</HI> retreated, the one was recruited from their Ships, and the other from the Town, who after a while facing each other, came to a second Engagement: but these also, as the former, were repuls'd, and forc'd to retreat with loss; and had the later Landed <HI>Hollanders</HI> been drawn up and setled in a Body, they had probably, by a total rout in their confused flight, broke in with them into the Town; but they seeing the <HI>Hollanders</HI> ad|vance no farther, fled not in, but lay sculking behind a natural Breast-work of Rocks that lay before the Town, whence they gawl'd them very much with continual flights of Arrows. The Admiral from Sea observing the difficul|ty of the Service, sent Order that Captain <HI>Poleman</HI> should Command in chief upon the Shore to prevent all disorders and confusions, ordering them to stand upon their Guard, and not venter too near the Town, while he should Land and plant some Cannon to facilitate the Storming thereof: But whilst the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made good their Ground all that Night, next Morning the Admiral himself Landed; then consulting what was best to be done, or whether they should Storm the City that day, Letters were presented them from <HI>Singlamong, Matithelavia,</HI> or <HI>Bethetok, Tonganpek,</HI> and other Commanders, in which they advis'd, That the <HI>Tartar</HI> Forces would set forth with their Fleet that very day, therefore they desir'd them to forbear Storming till their whole
<PB N="134" REF="79">
Force were conjoyn'd, that they might first together set upon the Enemy at Sea, and having routed them there, attended with Victory, next assault the Town, alledging, That when they had taken the City, all the adjacent Places and Isles would of themselves surrender. The Admiral, though well satisfi'd by this, that the <HI>Tartars</HI> were punctual to their Promises, yet thought it better not to lose time by suspending their Motion (which would ask some days) re|solv'd to give them a present Assault: whereupon it was unanimously agreed, with two Companies of Soldiers and some Sea-men with Hand-Granado's, to draw near, having a good Reserve upon all occasions: this no sooner conclu|ded, but they march'd up to the Walls, where while some ply'd the Defen|dants<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City <HI>Quemuy</HI> Stor|med.</NOTE> with Volleys of Shot, that they could not peep over the Wall, and others threw Hand-granado's, some set up Scaling-Ladders, on which they mounted very resolutely; but they being made of Canes, and over-burden'd with the Assailants, broke when they had in their hopes swallow'd the City; which the Admiral observing, and that they were like to do no good at present, sounded a Retreat; and so they drew off in some confusion, though with no considera|ble damage.</P>
<P>This Design falling out so unfortunately, the Admiral commanded all his Men aboard, and the next day set Sail to meet the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and the remainder of his Fleet, according to <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s Desire, having sent Letters before him to that purpose.</P>
<P>Whilst the Admiral made these Dispatches, and went with the Vice-Admiral went aboard the <HI>Ionker</HI> Frigat, a <HI>Chinese</HI> Messenger arriv'd with a Letter from <HI>Somminpesiou,</HI> in <HI>Coxin Kimpsia, Coxinga</HI>'s Son's Name, who had the chief Com|mand over his Forces. The Letter being interpreted, was found to be of the same Contents as that of the tenth instant, which we mention'd before. Be|sides this was another written by a <HI>Dutch</HI> Prisoner, <HI>Iohn Ianse</HI> of <HI>Bremen,</HI> who al|so desir'd them to agree with the <HI>Chineses,</HI> who, if the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were inclin'd to Trade, were best able to serve them; and to that end they might chuse a Place where they pleas'd, and it should be given them; and also that their King <HI>Kimsia</HI> did with the first opportunity expect the first Messenger <HI>Maurice,</HI> who he hop'd would bring him news, that they would agree with him; in hopes of which they intended to send them their Prisoners from <HI>Tayowan.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon the Admiral sent word again to <HI>Tsioubontok,</HI> That he had re|ceiv'd his Letters too late, because the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> had entred into a League before with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> by which they were oblig'd to maintain Wars against them, unless the <HI>Tartars</HI> gave any new occasion of breach; but as concerning <HI>Assam,</HI> or <HI>Maurice,</HI> he intended to send him by some other opportunity.</P>
<P>All things being now ready and in order, they weighed Anchor, and had not Sail'd far before they descry'd behind the Point of <HI>Quemuy</HI> two of their other Ships at an Anchor, by which they absolutely concluded, that the <HI>Tartars</HI> whole Fleet was there with them, because they also saw a great many Jonks Sailing behind the Island <HI>Lissoe;</HI> but in stead of coming on they dropp'd An|chor: when in the Evening the Admiral receiv'd another Letter from <HI>Ton|ganpek</HI> to this effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe eighteenth of our tenth Moon eight of your Ships Sail'd about <HI>Quemuy,</HI> which is very well done. This day I have receiv'd Letters from <HI>Singlamong</HI> to set Sail with your and our Ships on the one and twentieth of the tenth Moneth, from <HI>Wetauw</HI> to <HI>Tathaen:</HI> wherefore I and <HI>Matithelavia</HI> have set forward with the remainder of your

On the closing of this Let|ter we came with our Ionks and two of your Ships, to the Point of <HI>Osatauw,</HI> where we have taken some of the Enemy's Vessels, and with the slaughter of a few put the rest to flight: nothing now remains, but that we may&punc; conjoyn Forces at <HI>Lissoe,</HI> hoping there to meet you, that the next morning we may fall upon the Service.</P>
<P><HI>Which the Admiral presently answer'd, and sending Orders to his Reer-Admiral to be in a readiness, prepar'd for the Rendezvouz at</HI> Lissoe.</P>
<P><HI>The nineteenth he receiv'd other Letters, both from</HI> Tonganpek <HI>and his Reer-Admiral, giving an account onely of some small Actions, and a little jea|lousie of his Reer-Admiral concerning the</HI> Tartars; <HI>which he answer'd no otherwise, but that he would meet them at</HI> Lissoe.</P>
<P><HI>About day-break the Admiral receiv'd a Letter, brought in a</HI> Coxingan <HI>Vessel, from</HI> Tsioubontok, <HI>or the second Person to</HI> Kimsia; <HI>in which, in</HI> Kimsia's <HI>Name, was written to this effect:</HI></P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>Summimpessiou</HI> sends this Letter to the <HI>Holland</HI> Commanders in their Ships.</HEAD>
<P>YOur Letters which I receiv'd yesterday I partly understand, <HI>viz.</HI> that you have made a League with the <HI>Tartars;</HI> in so doing you have done well: for we know by experience, that you <HI>Hollanders</HI> never break your Words, and inviolably observe all Covenants and Promises. Whereas the <HI>Tartars</HI> were ever a perfidious and treacherous People: for it is common with them, after Articles of Peace, and Acts of Oblivion, whom they receive under their subjection, and should honorably protect, they without mercy murder, butchering in a manner, whole Provinces; and those great Persons that were able to withstand them, after they had invited them with golden Baits of Promotion, having once got them in their power, have first loaden them with Fetters, and after murder'd, witness my Grandfather <HI>Equon</HI> and others, whereof we have had woful experience these twenty years. They have threatned to destroy us and our Fleet with Fire and Sword, and take in <HI>Eymuy,</HI> and those Isles we stand possess'd off, but never durst look us in the face, till by the like dissembling arts they have drawn you in to their assistance; for which they promise you (if you will believe them) a free Trade for ever through the whole Empire: But they are onely pleasant with you, and intending no such matter. Besides, whensoever you with your Ships shall Engage ours, they will, to keep up their character of cowardise and treachery, leave you singly either to be over|thrown, or work out a hard, and at the best, a disputable Victory: but if by your sole Prowess and Power you subdue us, which we little fear, yet they will not onely take into their possession what you have won, but assume the whole honor of the Victory unto themselves: but we will not insist further on this Point. Your Nation we have a kindness for, because we know you to be honest, therefore we, as an honorable Enemy, hoping our selves to be suffici|ent enough to fight you, advise you to beware of Rocks and Shoals, whereof there are many in our Harbors: yet if upon better advice, and surer, you will come in to us, we have in <HI>Formosa</HI> at present twenty thousand <HI>Chineses,</HI> which make abundance of Sugar yearly; for which your Ships may come into the Haven of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> and there Traffick: to which purpose we will give you <HI>Tamsuy</HI> and <HI>Kelang,</HI> formerly inhabited by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and provide you with a good Harbor for your Ships: If these please you not, you may take <HI>Lamoa,</HI> or any other.

<P>The Admiral onely answer'd, That he was engag'd already to assist the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and they never made any breach with their Allies without many and just Provocations: therefore he could serve him no otherwise but by return|ning thanks for his kind proffers; and that they would continue their civility to their Prisoners, as he had done to theirs.</P>
<P>About nine a Clock in the afternoon the Admiral set Sail with his eight Ships to Engage with the Enemy's Forces, which consisted in a thousand as well great as small Jonks, and the day before anchor'd near the Island <HI>Lissoe:</HI> Then he Sail'd to the Southward of <HI>Quemuy,</HI> where he met with the remainder of his own and the <HI>Tartar</HI> Fleet: about Noon they fell in with some of the Ene|my's Jonks between <HI>Lissoe</HI> and <HI>Quemuy;</HI> and although they endeavor'd to hin|der them from running away, yet some of them made their escape, creeping close under the Shore, and steer'd their Course to <HI>Eymuy:</HI> however, they hemm'd in about fifty great Jonks of War, which after some resistance, and the sinking one of their biggest, us'd all means possible to break through, and to fall upon the <HI>Tartars,</HI> which lay without Shot, and not once offer'd to En|gage; which after some difficulty they effected, and immediately Boarding them, before the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> by reason of a Calm, could come to their assistance, behaved themselves with so much courage, that after a little resistance the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> were forc'd to flie up to the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ships, and leave two of their Jonks behind, one Commanded by the Admiral <HI>Bethetok,</HI> Governor of the City of <HI>Soanchieuw,</HI> and the other by the General <HI>Iantetok,</HI> which the Enemy took and plundred, but were afterwards by the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> regain'd, which the Enemy could not prevent, because upon the <HI>Hollanders</HI> approach they had enough to do to secure their own Jonks by flight; for their nimble Rowing (the Ships not being able by reason of the calm Weather to follow them) was their preserva|tion, onely one running on the Shore of <HI>Quemuy,</HI> was forsaken by her Men. Against the Evening the Enemy being much scatter'd, Tyded towards the South; but part of them chased along the Coast of <HI>Quemuy</HI> by the Rere-Admi|ral late in the Evening, made their escape. The Enemy thus fled, the Battel ended for that Night. The <HI>Tartar</HI> Jonks went to the North from whence they came, but the <HI>Hollanders</HI> anchor'd at <HI>Lissoe;</HI> whereupon search he found himself no way damnifi'd, but onely in his Sails, having but one Man kill'd, and about sixteen wounded.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> were now fully satisfi'd of the <HI>Tartars</HI> cowardise, for that with their whole Fleet, which was four times as strong as the Enemy's, they durst not Engage with seven or eight Jonks, but fled, as we said, for safeguard under the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> Guns, leaving their Admiral <HI>Bethetok,</HI> and the General <HI>Iantetok,</HI> which last was kill'd: whereas the Enemy, when he came near the great Ships, defended himself with Bowes and Arrows, and Darts, which in great abundance they shot and threw into the Sails, and likewise with small Shot and fiery Darts, yet did little damage.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="82">In the Evening the Interpreter <HI>Melman</HI> was sent aboard <HI>Tonganpek,</HI> to enquire how it hapned that his Men had not defended themselves better? whereto he made this Answer: <Q>That a sudden fear had surpris'd them; but desir'd him that he should be pleas'd at the rising of the Moon, to Sail between the Isle of <HI>Goutsoe</HI> and the other small Isles thereabouts to <HI>Eymuy,</HI> where he would meet him.</Q></P>
<P>The twentieth, two hours before Day, the Admiral with his whole Fleet set Sail for <HI>Eymuy,</HI> and Rowing along to the Southward, so passing by <HI>Goutsoe;</HI> not far from whence they spy'd <HI>Coxin'gas</HI> Fleet: whereupon the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made up towards them, as they on the other side did towards the <HI>Tartar</HI> Jonks, and about ten of the Clock came into the Channel between the Westermost Island of <HI>Toata</HI> and the Northern, or third of <HI>Goutsoe:</HI> but the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> because the Current was against them in that <HI>Straight,</HI> spent two hours in approaching the Enemy; by which time they had Engag'd the <HI>Tartars:</HI> but at the <HI>Hollanders</HI> coming in they quitted their Design, and shifted for their safety; which, though the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had them as in a Pound, that either they must be taken, sunk, or run ashore, they perform'd with such activity, skill and courage, that they broke through the midst of them, running their low-built Vessels close under their Guns, so fighting their Way, that of a hundred and eighty Ships of War, three onely were taken, the rest all entring with small damage into <HI>Quemuy</HI> and <HI>Goutsoe.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lipovi,</HI> greedy to hear of the Success, came down the River <HI>Chinchieu,</HI> and sent a <HI>Batsiang,</HI> or Messenger aboard the Admiral, to know the news and ad|vise concerning the Landing of the <HI>Tartar</HI> Horse at <HI>Eymuy:</HI> to all which he return'd an Answer in Writing by the same <HI>Batsiang,</HI> relating at large the whole circumstances of the Battel.</P>
<P>In the afternoon the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> saw four <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonks coming from <HI>Que|muy,</HI> which designed passing by them to go to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> but they were pre|vented in their Course by the Guns, and forc'd to Anchor near the Ships, of which the Commanders that lay nearest, went aboard, and according to the Admirals Order brought them into the middle of the Fleet; who being exa|min'd by the Commanders, told the Admiral, That they had onely six Fami|lies aboard, and Provisions for their Voyage: Whereupon he declar'd the Jonks to be free Prize, and gave all what was in them to be distributed amongst the Sea-men. Notwithstanding, some <HI>Tartar Mandarins</HI> came to intreat the Admiral to let them be discharg'd, alledging, that they had an Invitation by Letter from <HI>Geitonkok,</HI> Governor of <HI>Chinchieu,</HI> to make an escape over to them: but he having a Letter from <HI>Soanghieu,</HI> to spare none upon any pretence, but to make all Prize and Prisoners, made seizure, sending two of them, and keep|ing the other two for himself.</P>
<P>But <HI>Lipovi</HI> not long after sent another Letter to the Admiral, acknowledg|ing, that though he desir'd to be inform'd from his Excellency, yet he had seen the Fight, though at great distance from a Hill, and acknowledg'd the honor of the Victory belong'd only to his Ships. His Letter Translated was to this effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><HI>Lipovi,</HI> Chief Commander and General of the <HI>Tartar</HI> Forces in the Territory of <HI>Fokien,</HI> and Admiral of the Fleet before <HI>Eymuy,</HI> by this Letter sends kind Salutations to his Excellency the Admiral of the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></OPENER>
<P>THe one and twentieth in the Morning, from a Mountain I saw the co|ming of your Ships, and with joy beheld the driving away of the
<PB N="138" REF="83">
Pyrates Jonks with the Thunder of your Cannon. Now I see the integrity of your Nation, and that you mean as you say, and perform what you promise. I will not be negligent with the first opportunity, to signifie to my Master the good Service which you have done to his Imperial Majesty, and how bravely you have behav'd your selves in the Fight, routing yours and our Enemies. <HI>Soanghieu</HI>'s Supplies will be ready to joyn with us to morrow. What I have more to write, I hope ere long, Sir, to deliver by word of Mouth.</P>
<P>To which the Admiral return'd in brief, That he was much rejoyced that he was pleas'd to present their Business to the Emperor with such favor, that he should be the better prepar'd to requite their good Service.</P>
<P>With <HI>Lipovi</HI>'s Letter, <HI>Bort</HI> also receiv'd one from Admiral <HI>Sitetok,</HI> who sent him four fed Oxen which he had taken in <HI>Eymuy.</HI></P>
<P>The same day the Rere-Admiral brought <HI>Iohn Ianz,</HI> one of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Prison|ers aboard the Admiral, who had written the two fore-mention'd Letters, and was come in a <HI>Champan</HI> with four <HI>Chineses</HI> aboard the Rere-Admiral the day of the Fight, having on purpose misconstrued the Admiral's Letter to the <HI>Chineses</HI> desire, as if he had granted what was but in Proposal, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Nether|landers</HI> would Charge their Guns onely with Powder, and that he must go in Person to acquaint the Rere-Admiral with the Design: By which means he got his Liberty, and the rest were taken Prisoners.</P>
<P>Mean while, the Enemy being dispatch'd at Sea, the <HI>Tartars</HI> under <HI>Lipovi</HI> having Landed their Horse, which put the People under great consternation, they suddenly took the City of <HI>Eymuy</HI> by Storm, slaughtering the Inhabitants, and plundering their Houses.</P>
<P>The same day a <HI>Mandarin</HI> came with a Letter from the General to the Admi|ral, expressing his joy for having taken the City <HI>Eymuy,</HI> and desiring that on the Morrow he would be pleas'd to favor him so much as to come thither and speak with him. The Admiral congratulated his Victory, but excus'd himself as to waiting upon him, because of the distance of the Place.</P>
<P>The one and twentieth he receiv'd Missives from <HI>Tonganpek</HI> to this effect:</P>
</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<P>TWo days since I saw with great admiration, how valiantly your Ships behav'd themselves in the Engagement against the Enemy, which will so amaze the Pyrate himself, that he will never dare to look you in the Face. I for my particular part humbly thank you for such kind Service, in dissipating the Enemy. About three days since I sent you the Vice-Roy's Order, wherein he commands us to Sail with all our Fleet to <HI>Eymuy;</HI> but be|ing on my Way thither, I was by another Order detain'd at <HI>Liutien.</HI> Now in regard his intentions are to come in Person to <HI>Eymuy,</HI> I humbly desire you, according to his Request, that you will please to send five of your Ships to <HI>Liutien,</HI> and with the other ten lie at an Anchor before <HI>Eymuy,</HI> to prevent the Eenemy from making an escape, and in so doing you will oblige me. At present I have little of fresh Provision to send you; yet be pleas'd to accept this small Present, <HI>viz.</HI> five Porkers, fifty Capons, fifty Ducks, five Pots with Liquor, some Crabs, and ten <HI>Picols</HI> of Radishes.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>To this Letter he answer'd, That on <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s Request, to secure him and his Jonks from the Enemy, he would command eight of his Ships to Sail to <HI>Lissoe;</HI> and that they would not fail with the rest of their Fleet to come to the <HI>Tartars</HI> assistance.</P>

<P><PB REF="85">
<PB N="139" REF="85">No sooner was this Answer on Shore, but <HI>Lipovi</HI> sent a second Request, and that he need not trouble himself, for he was sufficiently Guarded by <HI>Tonganpek</HI> with his Forces: therefore if he would be pleas'd to come ashore, he and his <HI>Mandarins</HI> would entertain him in the fairest House in the Island.</P>
<P>Upon which Invitation, first chusing two Jonks for his own use out of those which he had taken, he went ashore, accompanied with the Vice-Admiral <HI>Hui|bert de Lairesse,</HI> and Captain <HI>Poleman.</HI></P>
<P>The General being assembled with his principal <HI>Mandarins</HI> in young <HI>Coxinga's</HI> House, receiv'd the Admiral with great courtesie and real joy. <HI>Lipovi</HI> also ascrib'd the honor of the Victory to the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> telling them, That it was not themselves, but they that had put the Enemy to the rout; that he had seen the Engagement at Sea before <HI>Eymuy,</HI> and sufficiently heard of that at <HI>Quemuy:</HI> for which much rejoycing, he highly extoll'd their Valor. Where|upon he assur'd the Admiral, That though he was not able to make satisfaction for the Service which they had done to his Countrey, he would endeavor that the Emperor should.</P>
<P><HI>Lipovy</HI> having ended his Discourse, the Admiral return'd in like manner, how glad he was for his Victory at <HI>Eymuy,</HI> wishing him many more, not doubt|ing but he should scowre the Sea, and clear the Port and Harbors from the <HI>Coxingans,</HI> that Pyratick Rabble.</P>
<P>After this the Admiral made three Requests to the General:</P>
<P>First, <HI>That he would be pleas'd to write a Letter to the</HI> Konbon <HI>in</HI> Hoksieu, <HI>and give Order in it, that the Goods which Captain</HI> Nobel <HI>and the Merchant</HI> Hogenhook <HI>had in</HI> Hoksieu, <HI>might be sold off.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>That they might not stay long there, but prosecute the Enemy on</HI> Quemuy <HI>and the other Isles.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>That the</HI> Tartars <HI>should then go with the</HI> Netherlanders <HI>to</HI> Formosa, <HI>and assist them in driving the Pirates from thence.</HI></P>
<P>The first and second Request <HI>Lipovi</HI> absolutely granted the Admiral, pro|mising more, That he would not fail to get them what they so much desir'd, a free Trade through the Empire, and that within two days they would Sail together to <HI>Quemuy.</HI> But concerning the third Proposal of going with the <HI>Ne|therlanders</HI> to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> he made no promise; but said, <HI>That perhaps would follow, after the rest of their work was finish'd.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>Lipovi</HI> recounted to him what purchase they had upon the Isle, con|sisting only in a few Cattel and Sheep, of which he sent forty Oxen and some of the Sheep aboard the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ships; promising them the whole Plunder of the other Isles, that his Men might not be discourag'd, but might venture their Lives for something.</P>
<P>Whilst the Admiral was ashore, three <HI>Champans</HI> with <HI>Chinese</HI> Rusticks came amongst the Fleet, which dwelt on the Main Land near <HI>Goutsoe,</HI> with Request to the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> to grant them a Pass to go to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and submit them|selves to his Subjection, by cutting their Hair like the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and paying of Tribute, which the Admiral so soon as he came aboard granted them; in re|quital whereof, they gave him four Hogs, and five Pots of <HI>Chinese</HI> Beer.</P>
<P>The Rusticks being ask'd concerning the condition of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Enemies, declar'd, <HI>That they were all fled away from thence in the night, none knowing whither they were gone.</HI></P>
<P>The two and twentieth, the Admiral receiv'd a Letter from his Highness, and the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong,</HI> in Thanks for his gotten Victories over the
<PB N="140" REF="86">
<HI>Chineses,</HI> with Intreaties, that he would Sail with the Fleet to the Isle of <HI>Goutsoe.</HI></P>
<P>The same day Captain <HI>Poleman</HI> and the Secretary were sent ashore to deli|ver to the Vice-Roy and General, what so long had slept, and would not be at first receiv'd, the Letter and Presents from <HI>Maetzuiker</HI> and the Council at <HI>Bata|via,</HI> and to request of <HI>Lipovi,</HI> that he would be pleas'd, according to his pro|mise the day before, to write to the <HI>Conbon,</HI> and with it send a Letter, which the Admiral had given to <HI>Poleman</HI> and the Secretary, and directed to <HI>Constantine No|bel</HI> at <HI>Hoksieu.</HI></P>
<P>The Agents having receiv'd their Orders, went in two Sloops to the Gene|ral, whom they found on the Main Land, opposite to <HI>Colongsoe;</HI> and after a kind Salutation to him from <HI>Maetzuiker,</HI> they deliver'd him the Letter, which the General having perus'd, declar'd, that their Excellencies Letters were very acceptable; yet it seem'd strange, that they should send Presents, when they knew it was not his Custom to receive any; but if they were useful in War, he would accept of them; to which being soon perswaded, he requir'd them as they were brought before him, and commanded them, without open|ing, to be carry'd to his Tent, only returning the Complement of Thanks; promising also to unite to the <HI>Conbon</HI> in <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> in the behalf of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> there: After this, the Agents having been nobly entertain'd by <HI>Lipovi,</HI> took their leave and departed.</P>
<P>The three and twentieth the Fleet having fir'd three Guns, set Sail to the Isle of <HI>Goutsoe,</HI> accompany'd with the <HI>Tartars;</HI> and about Noon they came to An|chor, a League and half South-West from the Island, not being able, by rea|son of a calm and contrary Tide, to double the North Fore-land, while the <HI>Tartar</HI> Jonks Anchor'd before <HI>Lissoe;</HI> from whence, the Admiral was desir'd by <HI>Sietetok</HI> and <HI>Tonganpek</HI> to come ashore, whither (having resolv'd to go be|fore) he went with <HI>Lairesse,</HI> Captain <HI>Poleman,</HI> and three Companies of Soldiers to the Isle of <HI>Goutsoe;</HI> from whence the Enemy was fled, and they took possession of three new rais'd Forts which were deserted, one of them with a Castle, and though not very beautiful, yet strong, for the Walls and Breast-Works which were twenty three Foot high, were made of firm Stones, and the Curtain on the Walls six Foot broad; the whole in Circum|ference, as big as the Castle at <HI>Batavia;</HI> but nothing was found in it, except Stools, Benches, (the <HI>Tartars</HI> having been there and Plunder'd all) and thirty nine unserviceable Iron Guns, which lay about; of these the <HI>Hollanders</HI> making themselves Masters, plac'd Centinels to look over them, till they had opportu|nity of Shipping.</P>
<P>The Admiral coming out of the Castle, was met by the <HI>Tartar</HI> General, who earnestly invited him aboard his Jonk to a small Treat, which he mo|destly excus'd, desiring them to take a slight Sea-Entertainment upon the Land, which he thought would not be inconvenient for either; so giving Or|der while the Meat was a Cooking, they view'd the other two forsaken Forts; one of which for the most part was cut out of a Rock, and built very strong on a Rivers side, whither oftentimes Armies of Hornets, thick like a Thun|der-Cloud, appearing cover the adjacent Countrey, devouring Plants, Fruits, and whatever they find where-ever they come; which before their lighting, to prevent, the Rusticks come arm'd with Canes, and Flags at the ends, and fight them by flourishing and waving them about their Heads, which fetches them down in thousands, where thus destroying some of them, the rest not ventu|ring to light, flie in their great bodies to other places, and so often clear the
<PB N="141" REF="86">

</FIGURE>
Countrey. Here the Admiral having spent some time, they were call'd down, where on the Sea shore they Eat, Drank, and were Merry; and well-pleas'd each departed to their own Quarters.</P>
<P>The next day there came Letters from <HI>Lipovi,</HI> that he had given Order to dismantle the three Castles, excusing it from the infertility of the Countrey, as unfit for the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to make any thing of, either to improve or Garrison; and that <HI>Formosa</HI> was much better for them to resettle upon, which they need not doubt, but the <HI>Tartars</HI> should help them to regain, and then they should possess it as formerly; but the Admiral sent word, that he would not suffer them to touch it, until the next day he had spoken with their General <HI>Lipovi.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after the Admiral receiv'd a Letter from <HI>Lipovi,</HI> which was to this effect:</P>
<P><HI>At present you have had much trouble, but now there is nothing left but the Isle</HI> Que|muy, <HI>which I desire you will Sail to with</HI> Setetok <HI>and</HI> Tonganpek, <HI>that there you may fully take satisfaction for your losses; and therefore let your Soldiers first Pillage the Countrey, and then ours shall be contented with the Gleanings: This done, We will burn and pull down the Towns, because we do not desire to keep them; when we have won</HI> Quemuy, <HI>then we will consult of further Proceedings.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty fifth in the Morning, the Admiral, and the <HI>Mars,</HI> and <HI>Zirikzee</HI> Frigats, setting Sail with all the <HI>Tartar</HI> Jonks to <HI>Quemuy,</HI> Anchor'd in the Afternoon between <HI>Lissoe</HI> and <HI>Toata,</HI> where he call'd a Council, to consult if they should take the Island <HI>Goutsoe</HI> in Possession, because of the Forts al|ready built upon it, and Garrison them, or not? Whereupon after some debate, they unanimously agreed, not to settle on that Island, nor Garrison the Forts, but suffer the <HI>Tartars</HI> to burn and destroy them, because it was little, barren, and not improvable by Cultivation; but their special reason was, that it would too much weaken them, having design'd so suddenly to fall upon <HI>Formosa.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty sixth in the Morning, the Admiral set Sail again, being fol|low'd
<PB N="142" REF="87">
by nine Frigats to the West side of <HI>Quemuy,</HI> where he Anchor'd amongst several <HI>Tartar</HI> Jonks, which Sail'd thither the day before.</P>
<P>The Rere-Admiral <HI>Verwei</HI> stay'd with five Ships at the Isle of <HI>Goutsoe,</HI> to bring away the remaining Guns, and make those that could not be brought unfit for Service by Cloying; with Orders also, that when he had done, he should come up to <HI>Quemuy.</HI></P>
<P>The Admiral and his Men going ashore, found the Enemy likewise fled from thence, and the <HI>Tartars</HI> pulling down, tearing, and rifling the City, which was contrary to <HI>Lipovi</HI>'s promise, who not only in his Letters, but per|sonally assur'd the Admiral, that the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> should have all the Plunder; but after this they set a less value upon the <HI>Tartars</HI> promises.</P>
<P>But however, the Admiral, Vice-Admiral and Captain <HI>Poleman</HI> went to see this little City, whose Walls were of an incredible thickness, yet not so strong as those of <HI>Aymuy,</HI> and an hours walking in Circumference, with four Gates, besides fifteen or sixteen Iron Guns, which the <HI>Tartars</HI> made Prize of. More|over, the City consisted all of Stone Houses, but thinner built than <HI>Aymuy,</HI> yet all were desolated, the Inhabitants being all fled, only here and there the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> pick'd up some miserable Creatures out of Holes and blind Recesses, whom they us'd Salvagely, killing some, cutting, slashing, and driving them like Cat|tel, which the Admiral observing and pitying, towards Evening went thence aboard.</P>
<P>The twenty seventh, the Admiral receiv'd several Letters, but that of most concern was this from the Vice-Roy and General, <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi,</HI> which were written before, but hinder'd by bad Weather, came not till now, being in effect the Contents of all the rest.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>YOu worthy <HI>Hollanders</HI> have had great care and trouble to beat the Pirate Our Enemy, which is very well known to Us; We may certainly say, that you have been a Terror to them, and put them to flight by your Valor and Conduct; I and <HI>Lipovi</HI> Thank you for the Service done to Our Empire. Three days since We desir'd you in a Letter to come to see Us at <HI>Cinwe,</HI> that there We might Communicate Our Consultations; to which We have re|ceiv'd your Answer and Resolution, that you intend to cleanse your Ships at <HI>Quemuy,</HI> which We are very well pleas'd with. But the Pirate out of fear of your Forces is fled, and hath settled on the Isle <HI>Tongsan,</HI> which place belongs to the Province of <HI>Fokien;</HI> therefore if he be not now prosecuted, he will soon return to the deserted Islands and sculking places which he hath for|saken. You write after you have cleans'd your Ships, that you will Sail to the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Wetaw,</HI> or to <HI>Soanchefoe,</HI> to speak with Us; which if the Enemy should hear of, he would soon come and find the Island, which is now Guar|ded by you, in its full state as he had left it; because you desir'd that the Forts there should not be pull'd down, nor the Houses in the City be burnt; if therefore the Enemy should find your People gone and his places no way ruin'd, he might perchance soon be Master of all again; wherefore We keep Our Forces in Arms near the Enemies Borders, lest that after your departure he should return.</P>
<P>The twentieth of Our tenth Moon, one of Our Commanders inform'd us, that in the last Month he took near <HI>Tongsan,</HI> in the Haven of <HI>Yuntzaw,</HI> an hundred and sixty Jonks and Vessels; and also that he took and kill'd five thousand Men, of which two hundred are yet kept Prisoners, whereof one
<PB N="143" REF="87">
is an eminent <HI>Mandarin</HI> Therefore since the Pyrate is so near, and it is not to be doubted but that he will settle himself again on the foremention'd Isle, We desire you to take this trouble upon you, and do so much Service more for this Empire, as to Sail with Our Jonks to <HI>Tongsoa,</HI> that there the Foe may also be dislodg'd. To which purpose, <HI>Lipovi</HI> and I are together at <HI>Cinwe,</HI> to give Order, that all Our Jonks, as well great as small, may be in readi|ness; and being furnish'd with Men and Provisions, may Sail with your Ships to <HI>Tongsoa.</HI> We very well know, that your People understand better how to fight at Sea than Ours; therefore I and <HI>Lipovi</HI> wish, that you be in|clin'd to go thither, that We may have it from your own Mouth; where|upon We will rely, and desire that We may know your answer by these two <HI>Mandarins;</HI> but if it be possible, take the trouble upon you, and come to Us in <HI>Cinwe,</HI> that We may consult about this and other Affairs.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The Interpreter and Secretary brought also a Copy of the Letter sent by <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi,</HI> about their business to the Emperor in <HI>Peking,</HI> which being Translated was to this effect.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe <HI>Holland</HI> Ships having set Sail with Our Jonks from <HI>Soanchefoe,</HI> and Anchor'd again at <HI>Wetauw,</HI> on the twelfth of the tenth Moon, the eighteenth of the same, eight Ships Sail'd to <HI>Quemuy,</HI> and seven <HI>Holland</HI> Ships with Our Jonks the day after pass'd thorow, and Anchor'd by Our Jonks on the West side of <HI>Quemuy.</HI></P>
<P>The nineteenth, Our People drove away some Jonks from <HI>Quemuy,</HI> but on the twentieth, We saw the Pyrates Jonks, being almost two hundred, com|ing from <HI>Goutsoe,</HI> towards Us and the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> who inclos'd the Enemy, and made such a rout amongst them, that they were forc'd to flie, having left many Men, as We understood of some that came over to Us from <HI>Eymuy.</HI></P>
<P>The one and twentieth day of the same Moon, the <HI>Holland</HI> Admiral went with a couragious Heart with his fifteen Ships to the Enemy at <HI>Taota,</HI> and stoutly Ingag'd him on the Isle <HI>Eymuy;</HI> from whence the Pyrate, to his great shame and disgrace, was also forc'd to flie to <HI>Goutsoe,</HI> whither the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and Our Jonks also Sailing on the twenty fourth, they found the Enemy fled thence Southwardly to <HI>Lamoa</HI> and <HI>Tangsoa.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty sixth, the <HI>Holland</HI> Ships Sail'd with Ours to <HI>Quemuy,</HI> and there caus'd by Our People, all the Towns and Forts to be burnt and pull'd down. The <HI>Hollands</HI> Admiral hath behav'd himself very Valiantly against the Ene|my; they are all a People of great Resolution and Valor, to fight with their Ships at Sea, and Musquets on the Shore; they have had a great deal of labor and trouble, for they carry many great Guns in their Ships, which require much trouble to Charge and Discharge them.</P>

<P>The Admiral writ in answer to their Excellencies, That he intended to send a Jonk to <HI>Batavia,</HI> with advice to the Lord General and <HI>Indian</HI> Council, of their Adventures concerning the Routing of their Enemy, and his deserting of their chief Cities, <HI>Eymuy, Quemuy, Goutsoe,</HI> and others; which done, and that he had cleans'd his Ships, he would in Person come to their <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi.</HI></NOTE> Highnesses, that then they might consult one with another concerning all their Affairs.</P>
<P>Moreover, the Admiral told the two foremention'd Messengers, how he was displeas'd, that their People had taken all the Booty on <HI>Quemuy,</HI> and given
<PB N="144" REF="88">
his Men not so much as an Ox, which was contrary to <HI>Lipovi</HI>'s promises, not onely in Person, but in his Letters also; alledging, that it no ways suited with their Natures to be serv'd so; which he desir'd them to tell <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Li|povi:</HI> Who reply'd, <HI>The Messengers had to their sorrow already understood it out of the Admirals Letter, and would not forget to make satisfaction for it.</HI></P>
<P>The same day the <HI>Vlaerding</HI> and <HI>Buiksloot</HI> came to an Anchor near the Island <HI>Quemuy,</HI> before <HI>Goutsoe;</HI> for the three other, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Cogge, Flushing,</HI> and <HI>Naerden</HI> could not get out. Here the Rere-Admiral <HI>Verwei</HI> told the Admiral, <HI>That since his depar|ture from thence, according to his Order, he had gotten twenty Iron Guns out of the Forts on the Isle</HI> Goutsoe, <HI>besides an hundred ninety eight Bullets, which were distributed amongst the</HI> Flushing, Buiksloot <HI>and</HI> Nieuwendam.</P>
<P>The third in the Morning, they saw one great new Jonk, one <HI>Wankan,</HI> and two <HI>Coyaes</HI> coming about the South-West Point of the Isle, to which most of the Ships sent their Boats and Sloops, to take them, which accordingly was perform'd by the Rere-Admiral, who took the Jonk, and also the three other Vessels, who yielded without the least resistance, all of them Loaden with Bal|last, Rice, and <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Unthres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">'d Rice.</NOTE> <HI>Padije.</HI></P>
<P>The Admiral and Rere-Admiral Rowing aboard the Jonk, found in her eight Iron Guns: The <HI>Chineses</HI> aboard inform'd them, that in the seventh Moon of the Year, they were sent by the young <HI>Coxin</HI> from the Isle <HI>Quemuy</HI> to <HI>Pakka, Kitat,</HI> and other adjacent Isles, and places lying to the Northward of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> there to Load as much Rice as they could get, and then return with all speed, because those places were in great want. They also related, That in the eighth Moon, they had found about the North several Bills of <HI>Singlamongs</HI> and <HI>Lipovi</HI>'s sticking up, whereby all the <HI>Chineses</HI> that kept out of the Empire were invited to come in to the <HI>Tartars.</HI> Thus the <HI>Chineses</HI> in the great Jonk inform'd the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> perhaps on advice of some <HI>Tartars</HI> that had been with them be|fore; For those of the other three Vessels declar'd, that they thought all things had still been there in their former state and condition, and expected to have found their Families at <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy;</HI> neither did they know any other, but that their Fleet had remain'd ready to have Ingag'd the <HI>Tartars:</HI> But com|ing about the South-West Point of <HI>Quemuy,</HI> and spying the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Ships, they would fain have fled, but were necessitated by reason of the calm, and seeing they could not get clear from them, to surrender themselves without any re|sistance; therefore they desir'd that their Lives might be spar'd, which they ob|tain'd. They also said, That they expected twenty Sail to follow them, which on the second instant they had left to the Northward of the Isle <HI>Ongkoe;</HI> from whence they came with six Vessels, of which, four were now in the <HI>Ne|therlanders</HI> Possession, and two Sail'd about the South, as they judg'd, to the Isles of <HI>Tangsoa</HI> and <HI>Lamao,</HI> where they dwelt: Being ask'd if they had not seen any of the Enemies Jonks coming from <HI>Iapan,</HI> at Sea, they reply'd, <HI>No, but that in this Moneth some were daily expected from thence.</HI></P>
<P>Soon after, <HI>Tonganpeks</HI> Admiral came aboard the <HI>Dutch</HI> Admiral, to ask what Vessels they were which he had taken, and from whence they came, and also if they had resisted the <HI>Netherlanders;</HI> of which they inform'd him as beforemention'd: Then he inquir'd when the Admiral intended to go to <HI>Sin|glamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi;</HI> and if he would Sail with them to <HI>Tangsoa?</HI> To the first Question the Admiral reply'd, That he knew not the certain day: And to the second, That he did not know what his Ships should do there, because their Highnesses had advis'd him, that one of the <HI>Tartars</HI> Commanders had some
<PB N="145" REF="88">
days since taken from the Enemy an hundred and sixty Vessels, and kill'd and taken Prisoners near five thousand Men. This, reply'd he, was not of the young <HI>Coxin</HI>'s power, but of another Pyrate, who kept about the Isles <HI>Tongsoa</HI> and <HI>Lamao,</HI> and was formerly neither subject to the <HI>Tartar</HI> nor <HI>Coxin,</HI> but set up for himself, and maintain'd Pyracy.</P>
<P>Then the Secretary related, That young <HI>Coxin</HI> had sent Agents to this Py|rate, to crave his assistance against the <HI>Tartars;</HI> and also that he was gone with all his Forces to <HI>Tangsoa</HI> and <HI>Lamao,</HI> there to joyn with him, because he did not know (being driven from the Isles <HI>Eymuy, Quemuy, Goutsoe,</HI> and others there|abouts) what he should do.</P>
<P>The same day they sent the conquer'd Jonk, by them call'd, <HI>The Good Tidings,</HI> to <HI>Batavia,</HI> with eight <HI>Chinese</HI> Prisoners, Letters, and Papers.</P>
<P>This day also the three remaining Ships which staid at <HI>Goutsoe</HI> to help take in the Guns, came to the Fleet at <HI>Quemuy;</HI> so that the whole Fleet consisting in fifteen Men of War, were all in a Body together.</P>
<P>The fourth, a <HI>Tartar</HI> Vessel with two <HI>Mandarins</HI> came to the Admiral with a Letter from <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi,</HI> in which they earnestly desir'd him, that he would repair to them at <HI>Cinwe.</HI> Whereto the Admiral reply'd, That so soon as his Ship was clear'd from the Rocks (for the day before it was driven within half a Musquet shot to the Rocky North-West Point of <HI>Quemuy</HI>) and lay out of danger amongst the other Ships, he would wait upon them.</P>
<P>Mean while came <HI>Maurice Iansz,</HI> whom the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> us'd as their Inter|preter in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue, and told the Admiral, That he had heard by some <HI>Tartar Chineses</HI> which came aboard with the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> that young <HI>Coxin</HI> had sent Agents to <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi,</HI> with proffers, that they would submit themselves to the <HI>Tartars</HI> Jurisdiction, by cutting off their Hair, because he was not able to maintain War against them any longer; but especially, by reason of those great losses which he had lately sustain'd.</P>
<P>The Admiral to learn the Truth of it, Order'd the Interpreter <HI>Melman</HI> to in|quire of the two <HI>Mandarins,</HI> who affirm'd it, with alledging, That the Enemy had lately so many wounded and slain Men by the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> Guns, that none of his Soldiers would fight any longer; nay, that all his Forces in <HI>Tayo|wan</HI> came flocking to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and would freely surrender both <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa</HI> to the <HI>Hollanders:</HI> Therefore the Vice-Roy and <HI>Lipovi</HI> desir'd to speak with him; also that <HI>Tonganpek</HI> was to go to <HI>Tayowan</HI> with some Jonks to fetch all that would submit themselves to their Emperor, and from thence bring them to the Main Land.</P>
<P>The next Morning, about five a Clock three Jonks came to the Fleet, and in them one <HI>Mandarin,</HI> who came aboard the Admiral, with request from their Highnesses, that seeing it was fair Weather, he would be pleas'd in those Jonks to come to them, or at least to appoint a day, because they might not wait in vain at <HI>Cinwe,</HI> from whence they were minded to go with the first con|veniency.</P>
<P>The Admiral having consulted with his Council, resolv'd to go thither the next Morning; whereupon the <HI>Mandarins</HI> went in one Jonk to carry the News to their Excellencies, leaving two behind amongst the Fleet to convey the Ad|miral to <HI>Cinwe.</HI></P>
<P>The sixth, the Admiral went according to his promise attended with Cap|tain <HI>Poleman,</HI> Secretary <HI>Ysbrantsz,</HI> and some other Retinue in the two <HI>Tartar</HI> Jonks sent for that purpose to the Fleet.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="89">In the Evening, the Vice-Roys Interpreter came to them, and in his Masters Name entring the Jonks, bad them welcome, with promises, that he would take care the next Morning to provide that they should be well Mounted for <HI>Cinwe.</HI></P>
<P>The seventh, the Admiral Landed between the <HI>Straights</HI> of <HI>Eymuy,</HI> and the main Coast of <HI>China,</HI> where he was presented with a Copy of a Letter, by a <HI>Batavian Chinese,</HI> call'd <HI>Seko,</HI> from <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> in <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> dated the twenty eighth of <HI>November,</HI> (of which the true Letter and Post was sent by the <HI>Conbon</HI>) in which they inform'd the Admiral, That they could not go from <HI>Soanchieu</HI> before the twentieth of the same Month, and that seven days after they came into <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> where they were not permitted to Vend their Com|modities according to the <HI>Conbon</HI> or Governors promise, till he had further Order from <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi,</HI> that when they told him that it was granted by the Vice-Roy and General, he reply'd, That he had no such advice.</P>
<P>The Letters and Presents of the Admirals he had receiv'd, and sent a Mes|senger to their Highnesses, to know their intentions concerning the Trade; further requesting, That they would be pleas'd to send him the Originals, writ|ten by <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi</HI> concerning the same. This Copy being deliver'd to the Admiral in his way, riding to the Vice-Roy, he would not read it till he had been receiv'd in the Vice-Roy's Tent; after which, he perus'd it in the Vice-Roy's presence, and three of his Council, and explaining it to them, ask'd them, Why against their written Obligation they kept their Merchandize un|sold? But the Vice-Roy excusing himself, said, That he had sent Letters of License to the <HI>Conbon;</HI> but <HI>Lipovi</HI> had Countermanded it, and first desir'd an Inventory of all the Merchandize which they had brought with them, that he might send it to <HI>Peking;</HI> but since that he and <HI>Lipovi</HI> joyntly had given free leave to sell those, and bring in other Goods; whereupon the Admiral de|sir'd, That he might have such a Letter of Command then given him, that he might send it with one of his own to <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> in <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> which the Vice-Roy immediately granted.</P>
<P>This Discourse being ended, <HI>Singlamong</HI> propos'd to the Admiral, and de|sir'd that he would send his Ships with their Jonks against the Enemy, who on the Isles <HI>Tongsoa</HI> and <HI>Lamoa</HI> did now fortifie himself; whereupon the Admi|ral reply'd, That he had heard and understood, that the Enemy had sent Agents to his Highness, and proffer'd to submit themselves to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and therefore (said he) how shall we understand your Proposal? The Vice-Roy pausing a little answer'd, 'Tis true, but there is no assurance in these Villains, neither do I believe them; therefore he judg'd it convenient, still to prosecute the War against them. The Admiral reply'd, That he intended to Sail to <HI>Tay|owan</HI> and <HI>Formosa,</HI> and therefore intreated him to send his Forces and Jonks first along with him thither, and then they would go joyntly, and drive the Enemy from <HI>Tongsoa</HI> and <HI>Lamoa;</HI> also that he had receiv'd Orders from his Ma|sters in <HI>Batavia,</HI> that when he had beaten the Enemy from <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> he should not go to <HI>Tongsoa</HI> or <HI>Lamoa,</HI> but to <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Tayowan:</HI> Besides, the Admiral added, that he had understood that the <HI>Coxingan</HI>'s were not in <HI>Tongsoa,</HI> but having Pillag'd the Rusticks, and taken what they could find, were gone to <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa;</HI> and though the Vice-Roy perswaded the Admiral that he was assur'd to the contrary, yet he stood firm to his Proposal, that he might go from thence to <HI>Tayowan;</HI> whereupon, the Vice-Roy obser|ving the Admiral to be in earnest, said, That the present routing of the Ene|my
<PB N="147" REF="89">
could not be taken for a Conquest, for they still had their Forces together, and therefore without doubt, as soon as the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ships were gone, they would return to their Receptacles again, and invest the Coasts as formerly. Whereupon the Admiral reply'd, That it was impossible to kill them all, be|cause where e're they came, they fled from them, and got away by the nim|bleness of their Jonks; and if the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> should go with the Vice-Roy's Jonks to <HI>Tangsoa</HI> and <HI>Lamoa,</HI> and drive the Enemies thence; yet the Coast would not so be clear'd of them, but that there would still be some in one place or other: To which the Vice-Roy said, that if the Enemy were but driven thence, he would be satisfi'd, because then he would be hunted out of the Territory of <HI>Fokien,</HI> where he was Chief; and then (proceeded he) my Jonks shall go with yours to <HI>Tayowan;</HI> therefore he desir'd the Admiral to consult with his Vice and Rere-Admiral about it; which he promis'd to do, and so ended that Consultation.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Singlamong</HI> excus'd himself concerning the forty promis'd Oxen; because he had no Vessels at <HI>Eymuy</HI> to bring them aboard the Admirals Ships; therefore he desir'd him to accept them now, and with them five hundred <HI>Pi|cols</HI> of Rice, which he had given Order to be carry'd before. The Admiral thanking him, said, That he needed not the Rice so much as the Cattel, how|ever, he would accept his kindness; but when they were brought aboard, half of them were dead, which they were forc'd to throw into the Sea, whereof the Vice-Roy having notice, promis'd, that for every dead Beast, they should have one alive.</P>
<P>Soon after, the Admiral having been well entertain'd, took his leave, and went to the Tents set up on purpose for them, near the Sea-side on a high Hill. No sooner was the Admiral come thither, but he receiv'd the promis'd Letter of Command to the <HI>Conbon,</HI> for selling the Merchandizes in <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> that he might send it himself with his Letter to <HI>Nobel,</HI> who was only to shew it to the <HI>Conbon,</HI> and then make Sale of his Goods, which contain'd to this effect.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD><HI>Singlamong</HI> sends this open Letter of Command to the <HI>Holland</HI> Admiral of the Sea, to be sent by him to their Agent in <HI>Hoksieu.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SInce the <HI>Hollanders</HI> with their Ships and Forces have done so good Service to Our Realm, in the routing their and Our Enemies, and the wish'd for Victory remains on Our sides, therefore I and <HI>Lipovi</HI> have resolv'd to Grant them to Sell all those Merchandizes, which they have brought with them in <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> for the maintaining of their People, as We have by Letters already inform'd the Emperor in <HI>Peking:</HI> Therefore We Command the <HI>Conbon</HI> in <HI>Hok|sieu,</HI> that he assist them in the same, and provide them a Person who may be present to look that they may not be cheated by Our Merchants.</P>
<P>This Letter We have sent open, that the <HI>Holland</HI> Agent, upon the receipt of these Our Orders, may immediately begin to dispose of his Goods that are ashore in <HI>Hoksieu;</HI> as also those that are yet in their Ships lying before the Magazine. The <HI>Mandarin,</HI> who by the <HI>Conbon</HI> is order'd to be at the selling of the Commo|dities, shall take an exact account of what Goods and Moneys the <HI>Hollanders</HI> receive in return for their Merchandize, that they may not be deceiv'd or de|frauded by any; and he shall also inform Us of what shall be done herein.</P>
<CLOSER>Under <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s Seal was written: <DATELINE><DATE>In the second Year of the Emperor <HI>Conchi</HI>'s Reign, the eleventh Moon, and eleventh day.</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="148" REF="90">In the Evening the Admiral sent the forty Oxen which had been given him by the Vice-Roy, to be distributed amongst the Ships.</P>
<P>Soon after the Vice-Roy sent to tell the Admiral, That if he was desirous to see the Countrey, he would send Horses to his Tent; for which Proffer he return'd thanks, and sent word, That he would expect them. Mean while it began to grow wet Weather; but the Rain again ceasing, the Admiral and his Company walk'd afoot to the Camp, where the <HI>Tartars</HI> had intrench'd them|selves very handsomly within several Batteries: Here getting on Horse-back, they were conducted to the Vice-Roys Tent, who desir'd the Admiral to come in, where having sate a while, he inquir'd if he had sent Letters to his Vice-Admiral, and also his Letter of Command to <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> in <HI>Hoksieu;</HI> to which he answer'd, <HI>Yes.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Vice-Roy told him, That he hop'd the Vice-Admiral would com|ply with his Request, to sail to <HI>Tongsoa:</HI> The Admiral answer'd, He suppos'd there was no doubt; and withal added, That <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Pedel</HI> desir'd they might go to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and therefore he had order'd <HI>Hogenhoek,</HI> who had liv'd many Years in <HI>Iapan,</HI> and the Factor <HI>Bartel</HI> (both Men of whom the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> and his Highness might expect good Service) to stay in <HI>Hoksieu:</HI> To which <HI>Singla|mong</HI> answer'd, That it was all one to him who staid, so they were People of good conversation, and he believ'd the Lord General would not send any other into that Empire. After this, they discours'd about the cleansing of the <HI>Ne|therland</HI> Ships, and the Island <HI>Colongsoe,</HI> which the Admiral desir'd he might see, and that if it lay convenient for the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> they might take it into pos|session, and Garrison it with Soldiers, the situation being near the Main Land, and before the Mouth of the River <HI>Chincheu,</HI> which whatever the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> wanted, they might have from thence, and likewise drive their Trade all under one. Whereupon the Vice-Roy replied, That they had always made choice of <HI>Goutsoe;</HI> What then would they do with <HI>Colongsoe?</HI> Whereupon the Admiral replied, That if he would permit them to drive their Trade, that then they would leave six Ships there, take the Island into Possession, and Garrison the Forts with their Soldiers: Whereto the Vice-Roy suddenly said, That that was not his meaning; for he durst not give away any Lands that belong'd to the Emperor, but that they must expect his Imperial Majesties Order for that, as well as the driving of their Trade in <HI>Hoksieu:</HI> Yet at last, after many Ar|guments, he granted the <HI>Hollanders</HI> on the Emperors allowance to take and Garrison the Isle of <HI>Goutsoe,</HI> conditionally, That if the Emperor should not approve of it, then to desert it again. But concerning their Traffick, Whe|ther it would be granted them for ever or not, they must expect an Answer in five Weeks time.</P>
<P>Thus the Business rested; and the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> after having been plentifully entertain'd, taking their leave, in the Evening rode to their Tents.</P>
<P>Towards Night the Admiral receiv'd a Letter from the Vice-Admiral <HI>Hui|bert de Lairesse,</HI> and his Council, in answer to one sent to him the day before, wherein he advis'd him, That their Opinions agreed with his, not to go with the Fleet to <HI>Tongsoa</HI> and <HI>Samoa;</HI> yet they referr'd themselves wholly to what the Admiral pleas'd to do.</P>
<P>The ninth the Vice-Roys Interpreter went to the Admiral, to know whe|ther he had receiv'd an Answer from the Vice-Admiral; whereupon the Admi|ral inform'd him, That he could not perswade his People to it, because it was impossible for them with their Ships to go from <HI>Tongsoa</HI> to <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Tayowan,</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="90">
whither they had strict Order first to Sail; according to which, after six days, he resolv'd to set Sail thither with his Ships that lay at <HI>Quemuy,</HI> desiring that his Highness would be pleas'd to send his Jonks with him; as after the subduing of the Isles of <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> he had promis'd; with which Answer the Interpreter return'd. But soon after he was sent back with the Vice-Roys Ex|cuses, That he could not send his Jonks with him to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> because they wanted Sails and Rigging for such a Voyage; but if they would please to stay a little longer, they would endeavor to fit themselves out: And as an Induce|ment to it, he granted them the Isle of <HI>Goutsoe,</HI> which they might freely take, and Garrison as they thought fit. But the Admiral much dissatisfied, answer'd, That he delighted not in such Procrastinations, nor would any longer be de|lay'd; for he plainly saw, and must be bold to say, That the Vice-Roy mind|ed not either what he said, or what he writ; and therefore they would no longer rely upon him: But as for <HI>Goutsoe,</HI> it was not then convenient for them to take the possession thereof, because they should thereby weaken their Forces design'd for the taking in of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> but if they would preserve the Forts and Houses from ruine till their return, then they would Garrison it.</P>
<P>Many other like Expressions he had to the Interpreter, concerning his not being satisfied with the Vice-Roys waverings and unconstancy; who relating it all to the Vice-Roy, he seem'd very much netled, to hear from the Admirals Mouth such his Character, and sent him back suddenly with several Comple|mental Excuses: But the <HI>Hollanders</HI> continuing firm to their Resolution, after many Messages toss'd too and fro, at last it was brought so far, that he not on|ly excus'd them from going to <HI>Tangsoa</HI> and <HI>Lamoa,</HI> but also consented, that with all the Fleet they might go to <HI>Formosa;</HI> promising likewise, that he would send two Jonks, Mann'd with two hundred Soldiers, to <HI>Formosa,</HI> under the Command of two <HI>Mandarins,</HI> with Letters to demand that Countrey for the <HI>Hollanders:</HI> But if the Enemies would not surrender to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> nor sub|mit to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> that then one of their Ships should come back with the two Jonks and <HI>Mandarins</HI> to inform him of it, that he might send all his Navy and Forces to their assistance, which, according to the Admirals Request, they should have confirm'd under his Sign Manual before they set Sail.</P>
<P>In the Evening Admiral <HI>Bort</HI> advis'd the Vice-Admiral <HI>Lairesse,</HI> in a Letter, of all that had pass'd ashore.</P>
<P>The tenth, he having resolv'd to go aboard the next Morning, desir'd his Goods might be put into a Jonk, and that he might be furnish'd with <HI>Coelyes</HI> for that purpose.</P>
<P>These <HI>Coelyes,</HI> by others call'd <HI>Poelyes,</HI> are a mean sort of Laboring People, that for small Wages will serve any Person whatsoever, in the Carriage of Bur|dens and Commodities from Place to Place, as our Porters or Carriers: They wear Shoes of Straw or Leather, which they tie about their Ancles with a String made fast at their Toes; and are so swift of Foot, that they can match a Horse in his full speed.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon Captain <HI>Poleman</HI> was sent to <HI>Singlamong,</HI> to thank him for the Kindnesses shewn to them while they had been on Shore, and also to ac|quaint him, that they would wait five or six days longer for the two Jonks and <HI>Mandarins,</HI> with two hundred Soldiers, and also the Letter to the Gover|nors of <HI>Tayowan:</HI> Lastly, to present his Highness, in the Admirals name, a Pair of Pistols and Holsters, and a Sword with a guilded Hilt.</P>
<P>At his Return <HI>Poleman</HI> related what he had receiv'd in answer, That his
<PB N="150" REF="91">
Highness was sorry he could give no better Entertainment; but he hoped they would excuse it, as being in a Camp, and not a City; That he would send the two Jonks and <HI>Mandarins,</HI> with the Soldiers, and also the Letter to the Gover|nor of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> at the appointed day: That he accepted the Presents, because they consisted in Arms, pretending to be asham'd, because the <HI>Ong</HI> or King of <HI>Batavia</HI> had twice sent to him, and he had not made one Return: But he would not forget to present him by the <HI>Finch</HI> some of the Products of his own Coun|trey, with a Letter, and humble Thanks for his good Inclination towards him.</P>
<P>The eleventh the Admiral and all his Retinue took their leaves, and soon after went to the Fleet, and <HI>Singlamong</HI> with his Army to <HI>Soanchieuw.</HI></P>
<P>The twelfth in the Afternoon the Admiral came near the low Point of <HI>Que|muy,</HI> aboard of the <HI>Zierikzee</HI> Frigat.</P>
<P>The thirteenth, several Jonks went from thence to <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Soanchieuw,</HI> whither <HI>Tonganpek</HI> was gone four days before, in which time he had written a Letter to the Admiral, to this effect.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I Thank you for the Honor and Kindness which I have receiv'd from you since We joyn'd Our Fleets. Now the Enemy is fled, there is great hopes that you may easily regain your Countreys of <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa.</HI> The Py|rate is retir'd to <HI>Tangsoa,</HI> whither We must pursue him; to which purpose, I will fit out eighty great and small Jonks, under the Command of <HI>Choentsay</HI> and <HI>Goemtsin,</HI> which shall Sail to <HI>Eymuy,</HI> and there joyn with <HI>Sitetok</HI>'s Fleet, I would have gone my self in Person, but that I am oblig'd to go to <HI>Soan|chefoe,</HI> to receive an Honor sent from the Court at <HI>Peking</HI> to be conferr'd up|on Me, which I thought good by these to acquaint your Honor with.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>In the Evening two <HI>Mandarins</HI> brought a Letter to the Admiral from the Ge|neral <HI>Lipovi</HI> at <HI>Soanchieuw,</HI> and also five hundred <HI>Picols</HI> of Rice, which he had for|merly promis'd to the Seamen and Soldiers.</P>
<P>The fourteenth in the Morning the Admiral went ashore in the Island <HI>Que|muy,</HI> where he view'd some ruin'd Villages, and especially the Wall'd City <HI>Savja-Houpon,</HI> being built in a pleasant Place, and full of fair Houses, but burnt by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> before the <HI>Hollanders</HI> coming thither.</P>
<P>This Town, according to the Relation of the <HI>Netherland</HI> Prisoner <HI>Maurice Iansz,</HI> was first built by the foremention'd <HI>Savja,</HI> in the time when old <HI>Coxinga</HI> went from thence to besiege <HI>Tayowan,</HI> having before had his Residence in <HI>Ey|muy,</HI> from whence he went to <HI>Quemuy.</HI> About six Months before <HI>Savja</HI> and his Brothers went thence, and Embarqu'd themselves to go over to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> be|cause young <HI>Coxin</HI> continually oppress'd them by over-heavy Taxations.</P>
<P><HI>Coxin</HI> having notice of this Flight of <HI>Savja,</HI> sent Messengers to him, with fair Promises not to molest him for the future, and to make him Chief Gover|nor of <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy;</HI> which Bait taking, he return'd, but was soon dis|patch'd out of the way, and all his Goods seiz'd, which being told to his Bro|thers, which were not yet come back (of which <HI>Tonganpek</HI> was one) they went over to the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>In the Afternoon the Admiral return'd aboard, whither in his way, going into the Boat, he found many dead Bodies, which had been cruelly Butcher'd by the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>The seventeenth two <HI>Mandarins</HI> came from <HI>Soanchieuw,</HI> to the Admiral, with the seal'd Letters from <HI>Singlamong,</HI> in which he advis'd the seventeen <HI>Chinese</HI>
<PB N="151" REF="91">
Commanders on <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Tayowan,</HI> to submit with their Soldiers and Coun|trey-men. The Letter was this effect.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>Lipovi's <HI>Letter sent to</HI> Tsiakoensin, Wetingwan, Toerlinpetensin, Posinso|jau, Yogaukiloo, Yoewetsji-kay, Gautinong, Soanchyong, Nioetingli, Chuenkicin, Lioetsingoen, Kiwintsiwan, Suangi, Gautinghtoe, Yuensau|gautingwan, Sinkintingjang, Ympincin, Lioetsinang, <HI>all Commanders in</HI> Tayowan.</OPENER>
<P>THis is to let you understand, That the Heavens, Sun, Moon, and Stars, nay all the Elements, have hunted you from one Place to another, till at last you came with <HI>Coxin</HI> into <HI>Tayowan:</HI> Now I and <HI>Singlamong</HI> tell you by this Our Letter, That on the tenth Moon, the one and twentieth day, with Ours and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Forces We have conquer'd the Isles of <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> and all the other adjacent Places of your Generals, and drove them so long, till they are fled to <HI>Tongsoa,</HI> where <HI>Kimsia, Coxinga's</HI> Son, and all his Party, do now sculk, but cannot find Sustenance there for so many Peo|ple: Who knows not that in short time he will die of Hunger? His Forces have already the last Month receiv'd a terrible blow; for one of Our Gene|rals, call'd <HI>Wansumpin,</HI> slew above ten thousand Men, besides two hundred which he took Prisoners, amongst which are three <HI>Mandarins, Tsiausou, Syancin,</HI> and <HI>Rikkoe.</HI> We have also taken from them in the Haven <HI>Yuntzauw</HI> a hundred and fifty Jonks and Vessels. Yet since <HI>Singlamong</HI> and I know that you in|tend and resolve to come to Us, and freely submit your selves to Our Govern|ment and Realm, when a fair Opportunity is offer'd; therefore We have sent these Agents and Letters with the <HI>Holland</HI> Forces to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> to perswade you to submit your selves to the Emperor.</P>
<P>At the coming of the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ships to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> you and your Soldiers having corrected your long Hair, shall come over to Us with those Ships; but if you will not reform your exuberant Locks in <HI>Tayowan,</HI> We will de|cline the so doing till you come on the main Land, under Our Government; but whether you pole your Heads, or not, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> shall transport you and yours in safety in their Ships; which if you distrust, upon notice given, I will send you of Ours, that shall Land you without doing you the least prejudice; and after assure your selves that you shall be preferr'd to the like Dignities and Imployments in Our Army, as you have in <HI>Tayowan,</HI> which We have already perform'd to others of your Party, as <HI>Tonganpek, Tuncinpek, Ian|tetok,</HI> and many more that yielded.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The like Letter was sent to the same Commanders by <HI>Singlamong.</HI> Besides other Letters of several Advices and sleight Concerns, too long to be here in|serted.</P>
<P>The twenty fifth the Council unanimously concluded, That since the Fleet was equipped and ready, to sail with the first fair Wind to <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Tayo|wan,</HI> and according to the States Order in <HI>Batavia,</HI> bring them under their Sub|jection.</P>
<P>To this purpose the two Jonks, call'd <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> which were amongst the Fleet, were fitted out: The biggest, being <HI>Quemuy,</HI> was Mann'd with thirty <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and fifteen <HI>Chinese</HI> Captives; and the smallest with twenty five <HI>Hollanders</HI> and twelve <HI>Chineses.</HI> Then the Admiral gave order,</P>
<P>First, That the Fleet should steer to the <HI>Piscadores,</HI> and there Anchor near the
<PB N="152" REF="92">
South Point of the <HI>Fishers-Isle,</HI> or the South-East Point of <HI>Pehoe,</HI> where the Rendezvouz should be, that from thence they might all go together. If any of the Ships should chance to miss the <HI>Piscadores,</HI> they should lose no time, but sail straight up to <HI>Formosa,</HI> and there attend the coming of the rest of the Fleet, which all should endeavor to get to the North Foreland of <HI>Tayowan.</HI> If any of the Ships, or the whole Fleet could not reach that Point, or come before <HI>Tayowan;</HI> nay, if they were got thither, or any where else on the <HI>Formosan</HI> Coast, and be necessitated to seek for a convenienter Anchoring Place, it was ordered, That they should go behind the Cape of <HI>Tankoya,</HI> from whence in fair Weather they might proceed forward in their Voyage to <HI>Tayowan:</HI> And that the Almighty might prosper them in their Undertakings, a Fast and Pray|er-day was order'd to be kept in all the Fleet the twenty eighth of that Month.</P>
<P>The twenty ninth the whole Fleet set sail, consisting in fifteen Ships, besides the two Jonks taken from <HI>Coxinga,</HI> and two others that belong'd to the <HI>Tartar,</HI> which they sent with their own Letters and Interpreter to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> and steer'd their Course South-West, between the Isles of <HI>Lissoe</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> and Anchor'd about Sun-set a League from the South-East Point of <HI>Quemuy,</HI> where being hindred by foul Weather, they lay all the next day.</P>
<P>Mean while a Jonk from the Enemy came to the Admiral with an open Letter from the <HI>Netherland</HI> Prisoners in <HI>Formosa,</HI> sign'd by fifteen of them, and written on the sixth Instant, in the Village <HI>Loakhou,</HI> near the <HI>Straights of Tayo|wan,</HI> which Letter inform'd them, That they not onely writ this from their own free inclination, but also by the express Order of <HI>Summimpessiou,</HI> who told them, That if the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> desir'd to treat with him, and drive their for|mer Trade, he would give them <HI>Tamsuy, Kelay,</HI> or <HI>Lemao,</HI> alledging, That if they would not accept that proffer, their Prisoners should never expect to be re|leas'd by him: Therefore they begg'd, That the Admiral would endeavor to work some means for their Liberty.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Admiral immediately call'd his Council, and read the Letter in the presence of the Messenger, who as he had peculiarly done to the Admi|ral, so he proffer'd the Council the same Places. But he had no written Orders for so doing, neither was he impower'd to Treat; for he declar'd, That he was onely sent to deliver the Letter, and to see how they were inclin'd: And al|though they endavor'd to draw from him some discovery of the Enemies Po|sture, by variety of Questions, yet they could get nothing more, than that by the young <HI>Coxin</HI>'s permission he was sent from the Governors of <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa,</HI> to <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi,</HI> to make some Agreement with the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore after serious Debate, the Admiral and his Council, with the five <HI>Tartar</HI> Agents approbation, answer'd the Bearer by Word of Mouth, That the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> would not be wanting on their parts, if they were inclin'd to agree with them, which they must manifest with the first opportunity, and to that purpose meet them in the <HI>Piscadores</HI> before <HI>Tayowan,</HI> whither they were now going. Likewise they gave him a Letter, in answer to that of the Pri|soners; yet the Contents were such, that if the Enemy should translate it, he should not pick any advantage out of it.</P>
<P>In the afternoon the Fleet proceeded on to the <HI>Piscadores,</HI> but was forc'd by a strong North-East Wind to Anchor two Leagues Southerly from <HI>Quemuy.</HI></P>
<P>In the Morning, being the first of <HI>February,</HI> the whole Fleet set sail again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">February.</NOTE> and on the second reach'd the South Point of <HI>Fishers-Isle,</HI> South-East and by East five Leagues from them. At the tacking about the South Point, they heard three
<PB N="153" REF="92">
Cannons fired in <HI>Church-Bay,</HI> which the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> suppos'd was a Sign to the Inhabitants, to give notice of the coming of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet.</P>
<P>In the Evening the Fleet came between the <HI>Great Table</HI> and the South Point of <HI>Fishers-Isle,</HI> and the next Morning they all dropp'd Anchor in the Bay of <HI>Pe|hoe,</HI> lying to the South-East.</P>
<P>In the Night the Weather grew very tempestuous, the Wind blowing hard out of the North-East.</P>
<P>The sixth the <HI>Sea-hound, Buiksloot,</HI> and <HI>Cinnamon-Tree</HI> Frigats, sail'd into the same Bay, close to the Shore.</P>
<P>In the Evening the Captains of the Ships were commanded early the next Morning to send their Boats full of Soldiers to those three Ships, but not to Land them till farther Order.</P>
<P>The seventh before day the Admiral and Captain <HI>Poleman</HI> went aboard the <HI>Buiksloot</HI> Frigat, from whence <HI>Poleman</HI> was sent ashore, with a Party of Men, to explore the Countrey, and bring off some Cattel if he could. Mean while the Admiral commanded the Captain of the <HI>Buiksloot</HI> to put a Cable out of his Stern, and bring all his Guns to one side, that, if occasion requir'd, they might fire at the Shore, which was immediately perform'd.</P>
<P>Whilst these things were doing, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were inform'd, That the <HI>Tartars</HI> had been ashore, and skirmishing with the Enemy, lost four Men; whereupon the Admiral sent word to Captain <HI>Poleman</HI> to be very careful, who immediately march'd with six Companies, each consisting of forty Men, up into the Countrey, and left one Company on the Shore. He had scarce march'd a League and half, when News was brought, That the Enemy had fallen up|on him, and that in the Skirmish five or six of his Men were wounded, and an Ensign slain. Amongst the wounded was Captain <HI>Bitter,</HI> who with an Ar|row was shot into the Foot, and also receiv'd two Cuts with a Sword through his Hat and Clothes, but not into his Flesh. The Admiral by this time being also landed, gave Order to all the Ships to send as many Sea-men ashore as they could spare, each arm'd with a Pike and Sword. Being now drawn up into Battalia, he sent two Companies more to Captain <HI>Poleman,</HI> and soon after a Company of Sea-men, who had not been gone above half an Hour, but a Ser|jeant sent from <HI>Poleman</HI> brought word, that the Enemy was put to flight, and fourteen of them slain. The Admiral sent back the Serjeant with Orders to Captain <HI>Poleman</HI> to pursue the Enemy as far as was possible, and prosecute the already gotten Victory; yet not to go any farther than he would be able to come back in the Evening; for the Admiral would wait his coming upon the Shore: Whereupon the Serjeant, with another Company of Soldiers, and some Sea-men, march'd away.</P>
<P>In the Evening <HI>Poleman</HI> return'd, and inform'd, That he had pursu'd the Enemy as soon as he had put his Men in Order again, having seen much Blood along the way which he went, and found four more lying dead, but met no manner of Resistance, nor saw so much as one <HI>Chinese</HI> afterwards.</P>
<P><HI>Poleman</HI> also brought a Horse and an Ass with him, but never an Ox nor Cow, notwithstanding he saw several hundreds, having no opportunity to fetch them.</P>
<P>The twenty eighth, about Day-break, six Companies of Soldiers and sixty Sea-men, under Captain <HI>Poleman</HI>'s Command, were sent to the <HI>Church-Bay;</HI> and two Companies of Soldiers, and twenty Sea-men, led by Captain <HI>Shim|melpewy</HI> to the <HI>Hollands Fort,</HI> with Order, That if they could not meet with
<PB N="154" REF="93">
any of the Enemy, to fetch some Cattel aboard of the Ships: In the Evening they return'd, having not met with any Opposition, but bringing with them about seventy Oxen, and some Sheep and Goats, which were distributed amongst the Ships and Soldiers.</P>
<P>The ninth in the Morning Captain <HI>Pooleman,</HI> with seven Companies of Sol|diers, march'd towards the <HI>Church-Bay,</HI> and several Places thereabouts, to see for more Cattel, with order to stay there all Night, and return to the Fleet the next day. The same day also the Admiral, Vice-Admiral, and several others, march'd with two Companies into the Countrey; and in the place where the Battel was, they found the fourteen foremention'd dead Bodies, which were stripp'd of all they had by the <HI>Tartars.</HI> Soon after the Admiral return'd to the Place where they had incamped themselves.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon, being the tenth, the <HI>Eymuy</HI> Jonk and the three Boats came again from the <HI>Church-Bay</HI> to the Fleet; and according to the Relation of the Secretary, who the day before had march'd thither by Land, and was now re|turn'd again with the Jonk, Captain <HI>Pooleman</HI> had given one whom he had ta|ken Prisoner his Liberty, on promise that he would furnish them with Cattel, and bring the Rusticks to them; which he endeavor'd, though to little pur|pose; for <HI>Pooleman</HI> got onely two Cows, a Calf, and a few Poultrey: But <HI>Peter Coker,</HI> who had been ashore with his three Boats full of Men before Cap|tain <HI>Pooleman</HI> came thither, had found fifteen Iron Guns, twelve of which, that carried from three to eight pound Bullets, did formerly belong to the <HI>Holland|ers;</HI> but the other three were made by the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P>Not long after <HI>Peter Coker</HI> came to the Admiral with some Prisoners and <HI>Chinese</HI> Rusticks of the Countrey, as also twenty six Cows and Oxen.</P>
<P>Lastly, the Admiral sent the foremention'd Villagers and Prisoners home, with Command, as they priz'd his favor, to bring more Cattel; and then gave them a Sack of Rice, and a Cup of <HI>Arak,</HI> for which with their Heads bow'd to the Ground they cry'd, <HI>Camsia Compagnia,</HI> that is, <HI>We thank the Company.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening the Admiral went aboard, but came ashore again the next Morning.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon Captain <HI>Pooleman</HI> with his Soldiers having been a foraging, brought some <HI>Chinese</HI> Peasants, and twenty Cows, to the Admiral, who dismis|sed the Men, upon promise of bringing in daily fresh Provisions.</P>
<P>The twelfth towards the Evening came about twenty five Countrey-men to the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> Camp, with Goats and Poultrey, for which the Admiral gave them two Bags of Rice, restor'd them the Prisoners, and granted them a free Pass, which was to this effect.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>SInce the People of this Countrey have submitted themselves, and as an earnest of Subjection, presented Us some Cattel, Sheep, and such as the Countrey affords; therefore We have taken them into Our Protection; and We charge and command all Persons, and especially the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> not to do them the least harm, when they of their own free Wills come with Pro|visions, or anything else, aboard of Our Ships.</P>

<P>The thirteenth, three Hours before day, the Fleet set Sail, and at four a Clock in the Afternoon dropp'd Anchor three quarters of a League North-East from the Castle <HI>Zelandia,</HI> with their fifteen Ships, besides the Jonk <HI>Eymuy,</HI> and the two <HI>Tartar</HI> Jonks.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="93">And now in regard the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> receiv'd no Tydings from the Shore, much less Proffers as they expected of surrendring up the Countrey: there|fore the Admiral on the fifteenth proposed to his Council what it was best to do in carrying on their design of recovering it; whether it were best first to Parly, or begin with the Sword. Hereupon they concluded, that they had ac|cepted of the <HI>Tartars</HI> Proposition about sending their Ambassadors with Letters from <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi</HI> to the Governors of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> according to a Result taken the eighteenth of <HI>December;</HI> in which the <HI>Chinese</HI> Commanders in <HI>For|mosa</HI> and <HI>Tayowan</HI> were desir'd with their Soldiers to come to the <HI>Tartars</HI> and deliver up the Countrey to the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> as we have before related: To which purpose the Agents were also among the Council; there to desire their Order to let them go with their Jonks, and two of the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ships to <HI>Tan|koya,</HI> and there to deliver their peculiar Letters, and advise them to come over to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> alledging, That they could never do it in a better time: where|upon, after serious consideration, the Council granted their Request, and as Convoys, sent two Frigats along with them.</P>
<P>Soon after the two <HI>Tartar</HI> Jonks, conducted by the two Frigats, took their Voyage to <HI>Tankoya.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning, about two hours before Day, the Admiral set Sail with six Frigats more to the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Tankoya,</HI> and two hours after Noon Rid by the Frigats that set Sail before, and the two <HI>Tartar</HI> Jonks lying Westerly about a League from the Point.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartar</HI> Agents being Landed with their Letters, they immediately met with a great company of People; who soon after ran all up into the Countrey, so that they saw not one Man afterwards.</P>
<P>Towards the Evening the Rere-Admiral <HI>Verwei</HI> came aboard the Admiral, with news, That one of the <HI>Tartar</HI> Agents was return'd, who told him that they had deliver'd all the Letters, to which they expected a sudden Answer, and doubted not but they should attain their Desire, four hundred Soldiers be|ing already prepar'd to come over to them; of which one hundred lay at the Mountain <HI>Tankoya,</HI> and three hundred at the River of <HI>Tamsuy,</HI> where the Ene|my fear'd that the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> would Land.</P>
<P>In the Morning, being the nineteenth, the Jonk <HI>Eymuy</HI> came from <HI>Tayowan</HI> to the Admiral at <HI>Cape Tankoya,</HI> with Letters from the Vice-Admiral <HI>Huibert de Lairesse,</HI> and another from the Governors of <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa,</HI> to the <HI>Netherlanders.</HI></P>
<P>The Rere-Admiral, presently after the Admirals departure from him, Sail'd with all the small Frigats within Shot of the Castle <HI>Zelandia:</HI> which his ap|pearance wrought such effect, that those on the Shore sent the foremention'd Letter to him; so that he did not think it convenient to make any farther pro|gress with their Boats before they heard further from the Admiral. The Let|ter was to this effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>The Governors of <HI>Formosa, Kovia, Anghia, and Oenia,</HI> have receiv'd the Letter from the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and return this Answer.</HEAD>
<P><HI>FOrmosa</HI> belongs to us of old. The young <HI>Coxins</HI> Father permitted the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> to live and drive a Trade with them: after which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> made themselves Masters of the Countrey, and opprest the Inhabitants with Taxes, who complain'd of it to <HI>Coxin:</HI> Whereupon he came with an Army
<PB N="156" REF="94">
and Conquering <HI>Tayowan</HI> took it into his possession, and after the <HI>Hollanders</HI> went from thence elected us to be Governors of it: and we have, according to the Articles of War, maintain'd your Prisoners, and furnish'd those that went to <HI>Batavia</HI> with all Necessaries. <HI>Coxin</HI> also sent a <HI>Mandarin</HI> with a <HI>Hol|land</HI> Ship to <HI>Quemuy,</HI> to fetch the Governor <HI>Valentine,</HI> and other Prisoners from thence: but the <HI>Hollanders</HI> did not endeavor to get thither, but carry'd the <HI>Mandarin</HI> with the rest to <HI>Batavia;</HI> so that the Prisoners remain'd in our custody, where they have wanted nothing but Liberty: but you kept the <HI>Mandarin,</HI> and carry'd him to the <HI>Tartars</HI> your Allies, who are a very fickle and false People, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have had trial of in <HI>Canton,</HI> where they first granted them to Trade, and afterwards defrauded and deceiv'd them. Now you have receiv'd Promises from them in <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> that you may settle on <HI>Haythom</HI> and <HI>Colongsoe,</HI> and there drive a Trade. The old <HI>Coxin</HI> knew very well what treacherous People the <HI>Tartars</HI> were, therefore he would never agree with them. They have often sent Ambassadors to Treat about Peace, under which pretence some years since they had like to have taken <HI>Eymuy;</HI> but it fell not out according to their expectation, for they were beaten from thence, and all the Prisoners we took, we chopp'd off their Hands and Feet and so sent them home, which we suppose you are not ignorant of; but on the contrary, <HI>Coxin</HI> knows the <HI>Hollanders</HI> are a People that keep their Word, therefore he hath us'd the Prisoners well: but now you are joyn'd with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and have taken the Countreys of <HI>Eymuy, Quemuy,</HI> and <HI>Goutsoe</HI> from us; yet nevertheless the <HI>Tartars</HI> dare not take them in possession, but have one|ly burnt down the Houses; nay, they have sent Agents since that to the young <HI>Coxin,</HI> to desire him with his People to come under their Protection, which he hath refus'd. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> have a considerable time Sail'd up and down the Coast, and have not yet obtain'd from the <HI>Tartars</HI> a Place to settle on, by which they may plainly perceive their treachery. Your Letter we have receiv'd, and thereby partly understand your Request, to deliver your Prisoners, which we think very fit: they are all in good health, and have a good allowance. We know that you <HI>Hollanders</HI> seek nothing but Trade, yet we are not ignorant that you will not trust us, and therefore neither credit our Sayings nor Writings: nevertheless you may believe that <HI>Sepoan,</HI> or <HI>Kimsia,</HI> would agree with you. If you are so inclin'd, and desire to settle in any Place, send us Ambassadors, Persons of Repute, whom we will not de|tain, if you do not keep ours: if you are hereto inclin'd, do it suddenly, that we may inform <HI>Sepoan</HI> of it, and make a League with you, that we may no longer stand in fear one of another, but Trade friendly together; for the <HI>Tartar,</HI> assure your self, will at one time or other delude you. This our Writing you may credit, taking the Heavens to witness the truth thereof.</P>

<P>The same Morning the Rere-Admiral <HI>Verwei</HI> came Aboard the Admiral with four <HI>Tartar</HI> Agents, and two Persons belonging to the Enemy; who being heard in the Councel, declar'd, That they were sent from <HI>Siautongsiong,</HI> Com|mander in Chief of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Forces in the South part of <HI>Formosa</HI> to Treat with the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> and make them divers friendly Proposals. Whereupon the Admiral demanded, How many Men the Collonel <HI>Siautongsiong</HI> had? they answer'd, Seven thousand; which so startled the Admiral, that he knew not what to resolve upon. At last he demanded, What they would desire of the
<PB N="157" REF="94">
<HI>Netherlanders?</HI> they reply'd, That they had no Order, but onely that they came thither to hear what the <HI>Hollanders</HI> would proffer. Lastly, having seri|ously debated the Business, they resolv'd to proffer the Collonel five thousand Tail of <HI>Iapan</HI> Silver so soon as he should come to them, with a <HI>Proviso,</HI> That if the <HI>Hollanders</HI> should want his Men, they should assist them against the Ene|my, which they promis'd, but insisted, that the Sum was too little; so that they desir'd, if the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were really inclin'd to agree, they should send some Person of Quality to the Collonel, to Treat with him himself, proffering to leave one of their number, to stay as a Hostage till the Person whom they should send did return.</P>
<P>In the afternoon the Secretary, with the Interpreter <HI>Maurice,</HI> the <HI>Tartar</HI> Agents, and one of the Messengers were sent to <HI>Siautongsiong</HI> with a Letter, in which he promised him the foremention'd Sum; and another to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Prisoners, intimating to them the hopes of their Liberty.</P>
<P>After the Secretaries departure, a <HI>Tartar</HI> Jonk was sent to <HI>Tayowan</HI> to <HI>Lairesse,</HI> with Orders to send the two <HI>Chineses</HI> with a Letter to the Governors there, proposing the release of their Prisoners, and offering a Treaty upon honorable terms.</P>
<P>The same day the Soldiers in the eight Ships under the Admirals Squadron, consisting in eight hundred Men, were divided into sixteen Companies and put ashore, and the day after the Tents which were pitch'd under the side of a Mountain, were quite finish'd.</P>
<P>The one and twentieth about Noon, Secretary <HI>Ysbrant</HI> came back with the Interpreter <HI>Maurice,</HI> sent on the nineteenth to <HI>Siautongsiong,</HI> and related, That he had deliver'd him the Admirals Letter, and discoursed with him; whereby he found that the Collonel was inclin'd to come with four thousand Armed Men to the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> that so he might be carry'd to the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> provided the <HI>Hollanders</HI> would give him ten thousand Tail of <HI>Iapan</HI> Silver; of which they should pay five thousand so soon as he had given them Hostage, that he might distribute it amongst his Soldiers, and the other half (being for him and his Officers) should be paid him so soon as he came aboard their Ships, alledging, that those of <HI>Sakkam</HI> and <HI>Tayowan,</HI> being about nine thousand Armed Men, would immediately after his deserting them, endeavor to agree with them; that for a little Money they should surrender up the Castle and Forts, with all the Countrey thereabouts, and go to the Coast of <HI>China.</HI> And further, he desir'd to keep five hundred Acres of Land, and two hundred Horses, that were his own, which he would lend the <HI>Hollanders</HI> till they were Masters of the Countrey. Besides, at the Secretaries Request he had underta|ken to deliver the <HI>Netherland</HI> Prisoners, and to that purpose advis'd him to send one or two Ships more from the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Tankoya</HI> to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> that those of the Castle might not send out Forces, and prevent the Design.</P>
<P>Whilst they were driving this Bargain, the Jonk <HI>Eymuy</HI> came to the Admi|ral at the Point of <HI>Tankoya,</HI> sent by the Vice-Admiral <HI>Lairesse</HI> from <HI>Tayowan,</HI> with News, That the Enemy, as he perceiv'd with his Perspective Glasses, wrought very hard upon three Forts, which he had now finish'd, leading them cross from the Sea-shore to the In-land Water; and also that the Enemy before with eight or nine great Jonks set Sail thence.</P>
<P>The two and twentieth, being <HI>Tuesday,</HI> the Interpreter <HI>Maurice</HI> went again to <HI>Siautongsiong</HI> with a <HI>Chinese</HI> Letter, in which he was promis'd five thousand Tail of <HI>Iapan</HI> Silver, so soon as he brought the <HI>Netherland</HI> Prisoners from <HI>Sak|kam</HI>

to their Camp, and that then he should with all his Soldiers come to the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> and go over with them to the Main of <HI>China.</HI> And the same day two Ships were, according to his Request sent from the Fleet at <HI>Tankoya</HI> to <HI>Tayowan.</HI></P>
<P>The three and twentieth in the afternoon the Interpreter <HI>Maurice</HI> return'd, with tydings, That the delivering of the <HI>Netherland</HI> Prisoners could not be ef|fected, because <HI>Siautongsiong,</HI> before he would undertake it, would first receive five thousand Tail of Silver. But the Admiral and his Council no way appro|ving of it, sent them and the former Hostages to their Masters, notwithstand|ing the <HI>Tartars</HI> endeavor'd to perswade the Admiral to pay the five thousand Tail, alledging, That the <HI>Chineses</HI> at their coming over must leave their Estates behind them, therefore they ought to be perswaded thereto by Money. But the Admiral answer'd, That if they should have sent him the Money, they could not have been assur'd of his coming to them by his leaving those two in|considerable Hostages, and thereupon resolutely declared, That if <HI>Siautongsiong</HI> desir'd Money, he should first deliver the <HI>Netherland</HI> Prisoners, and come to them.</P>
<P>The four and twenteth in the Morning, the <HI>Zierickzee</HI> and <HI>Tertolen</HI> Frigats, sent two days before to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> came again to the Fleet at <HI>Tankoya,</HI> with Let|ters from the Vice-Admiral <HI>Lairesse,</HI> and the <HI>Chinese</HI> Governors in <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Tayowan,</HI> in answer to the Admirals, written to them on the nineteenth. Whilst <HI>Lairesse</HI> lay with part of the Fleet before <HI>Tayowan,</HI> they perceiv'd that those which they suppos'd to have been Battlements before the Castle of <HI>Zelandia,</HI> as he had advis'd in his first Letter, were onely Nets, hung up there to dry. The <HI>Chinese</HI> Letter was to this effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>YOu <HI>Hollanders</HI> write to us to send two Men to Treat with you, which we are not inclin'd to do before you send two Persons to Treat with us first: neither do you understand our Language, which made you send two <HI>Chinese</HI> Rusticks with Letters. As to what concerns the Letter written to your Prisoners, we have made them translate it in our Presence, and thereby understand your kind Salutation to them all, and also your inclination to agree with us, and cut off the League with the <HI>Tartars;</HI> with Requests more|over, that the Prisoners should be set at liberty: if your meaning be so, we shall be very glad; but the contrary hath appear'd to us by a Letter brought to us ashore by <HI>Assam</HI> and another Person, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> are yet united with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> as is manifested also by <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovy</HI>'s Let|ters written to us; so that we know not what to think of this contradiction. We believe what ever you do is meerly to deceive us, and to draw away our People, but we will prevent it with our greatest care. Besides, you have, according to the information of your <HI>Holland</HI> Prisoners to us, writ to them, That you are cozen'd by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> because you could not get a Place in possession to drive your Trade on, and therefore forc'd to Cruise up and down the Seas with your Ships: If this be truth, we will agree with you. If you are resolv'd, and desirous to Treat with us, send <HI>Assam</HI> and two other Persons of Quality to us, whom we promise to entertain nobly, and after having Treated with them, let them go freely away; and when we are agreed, we will also send your Prisoners, and give notice to the young <HI>Coxin|ga,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Sepoan,</HI> that we are agreed.</P>

<P>The Council of War in answer to this Letter, writ to the Governors
<PB N="159" REF="95">
of <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Tayowan</HI> the twenty fourth of <HI>Ianuary</HI> from <HI>Tankoya,</HI> to this effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<P><HI>WE thought to have had a better Answer from you, than your Letter, which we re|ceiv'd this instant, makes mention of; for thereby appears to us, that you will not send any body to us, neither of your own nor of our Prisoners. When we lay before</HI> Que|muy, <HI>before our coming hither, a Letter came from</HI> Sepoan, <HI>wherein you specifi'd your inclination to agree with us: and do you now require Agents from us to Treat with you? We positively declare, that you shall first send one to us, and hear our Answer to your Prof|fer, to give us</HI> Quelang, Tamsui, Pehoe, <HI>or</HI> Lamoa, <HI>and then we will Treat further, and perhaps make a good Agreement: which if you will not do, and send us no Answer here|upon, we will in the space of two days put our Flag of Defiance, and use Hostility against you every where. Our gotten Victories before</HI> Eymuy <HI>and</HI> Quemuy, <HI>with the ruine of both Cities, as also of the Forts on</HI> Colongsoe <HI>and</HI> Goutsoe, <HI>witness our Power: therefore since we cannot do any thing to you by fair means, we will try what we can do by force of Arms; for we have that God, who is Creator of Heaven and Earth, on our sides: neither are we at such difference with the</HI> Tartars, <HI>as you suppose. We drive a Trade again in</HI> Hoksieu, <HI>and their whole Countrey is at our Service, and stands open for us: we may put into any of their Harbors with our Ships: nay, they promise to assist us with all their Ionks and Forces, if you are stubborn and will not agree with us: Therefore consider with your selves, and do not refuse our good Proffers whilst you may have them. Here inclos'd is a Letter to our Friends, your Prisoners, which pray deliver to them: we observe that they have not well understood our meaning, of which at present we have given them better information.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>These Letters were carry'd to <HI>Lairesse</HI> by the <HI>Zierikzee</HI> Frigat, with Orders moreover to him, that the sending to redeem the Prisoners was come to effect; and also that the Collonel <HI>Sautongsiong</HI> had already inform'd those at <HI>Tayowan</HI> concerning their Treating with him, as they had perceiv'd by their Letters.</P>
<P>Upon the sending of these Letters ashore, <HI>Lairesse</HI> was order'd to stay two days for an Answer; but if then he receiv'd none, to fire a Cannon with a Bullet on the Shore, and set up a red Flag from all the Ships, and then come together to the Admiral, that they might consult together what was best to be done: But if they should, according to the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> Request, send some of their Men to Treat with them, and should desire that some of the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> should go ashore again, that <HI>Lairesse</HI> should send the Factor <HI>Philip Mey.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty eighth the Ensign, <HI>Christopher Iust,</HI> came to tell the Admiral, that the Enemy was that Morning come over the In-land Water on that Tract of Land, where their Men lay Encamp'd with a considerable Army; and be|ing both Horse and Foot carry'd about seventy Colours, which he himself had told, and discover'd accidentally, going with five Men more the last Night to shoot some Venison, towards the South near the River of <HI>Tamsuy.</HI></P>
<P>The Admiral immediately upon this Intelligence went ashore, where he caus'd the convenientest Place, about a Cannon-shot from the Hill (where the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> pitched their Tents,) to be Entrench'd, and some great Guns to be carry'd thither, that therewith they might put a stop to the Enemy, if he should march forward; who about two Leagues from thence had Encamp'd himself, and shown many Bravado's with his Horse, but yet durst not set upon the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> who kept themselves in good Order at the fore-mention'd Entrenchment, that they might not lose their advantage.</P>
<P>The next Morning, being the twenty sixth, the Enemy sent three Men with a Letter to the Admiral, who gave them Audience, and read it without

the Works, which were not then finish'd, in a Tent. The Letter was to this effect:</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Whereupon the Interpreter <HI>Maurice</HI> was sent with the two <HI>Tartar</HI> Agents to the Enemies Camp, fully to know their Intentions, and also to tell them the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> Resolutions. The <HI>Tartars</HI> returning before, were in the Evening follow'd by the Interpreter, who was immediately sent back again with a Mes|sage, that the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> granted his Request, <HI>viz.</HI> To send two Persons of theirs to him, so soon as the six Hostages which he had proffer'd should come into their Camp, who that very Night came thither with the Interpreters.</P>
<P>At the same time a Rumor was spread, and the <HI>Chinese</HI> General had also told it to the Interpreter <HI>Maurice,</HI> That the young <HI>Coxinga</HI> was gone to the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> to submit himself to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and accordingly had commanded his Soldiers in <HI>Formosa</HI> to come to him, and surrender up the Countrey to the <HI>Ne|therlanders:</HI> But this quickly appear'd nothing but a bare Report.</P>
<P>The twenty seventh in the Morning, according to a Result taken by the Admiral and his Council, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Agents were sent to the Enemies Camp, <HI>viz.</HI> the Lieutenant <HI>Hendrick Noorden,</HI> and Factor <HI>Iohn Renaldus,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Melman,</HI> as Interpreter, for their Assistant. They were fetch'd in on Horse|back, and courteously receiv'd and entertain'd by the <HI>Chinese</HI> General, who ac|cording to his Promise was ready with his whole Army, consisting in two thousand Armed Men, to break up that day, and go with them by Land to <HI>Tayowan.</HI></P>
<P>The Agents had these following Orders given them in writing to Read to the <HI>Chinese</HI> Governors at <HI>Tayowan.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>I.</HI> That they should deliver and surrender the whole Countrey of <HI>Formosa</HI> to the <HI>Ne|therlanders,</HI> that it might be possess'd and Govern'd by them as formerly.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>II.</HI> Especially the Castle <HI>Zelandia</HI> in <HI>Tayowan,</HI> and the Fort <HI>Provencia,</HI> in <HI>Sakkam,</HI> with all the Guns and other Ammunition, and also <HI>Quelang.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>III.</HI> To restore the Companies Goods, Merchandizes, Moneys, and other things, which at the surrender of <HI>Tayowan</HI> they took possession of; and also satisfaction for the Charge which they had been at in coming two several years with a Fleet of Ships to their Coasts, which had cost above sixty Tun of Gold.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>IV.</HI> All Debtors to the Company, whether their Servants or Free People, shall satisfie their Creditors.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="161" REF="96"><HI>V.</HI> Our Prisoners shall immediately be redeem'd, and sent with their Goods to our Ships.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>VI.</HI> On the granting and allowing of these Articles, there shall be an everlasting Peace betwixt them and us, and all things past shall be forgotten and forgiven.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The Commissioners having Read the Articles severally to them, said, That the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> desir'd a speedy Answer, what they were inclin'd to grant or not, and also what they would have of the <HI>Netherlanders.</HI></P>
<P>Three Sea-men, which were sent along with the Agents to carry some Goods, came back with two <HI>Chineses,</HI> sent from the Enemy with two live Hogs, and four Baskets of Potato's, for a Present to the <HI>Netherlanders;</HI> who gave the Bearers two <HI>Cangans,</HI> and as much Meat as they would eat, which they devour'd very greedily: He also gave them a Pass to bring Provision into our Camp.</P>
<P>After the Enemy had broke up with his Army, the Admiral, according to a Resolution taken a little before, also made himself ready to go with the Hosta|ges from <HI>Tankoya</HI> to <HI>Tayowan;</HI> to which purpose towards the Evening leaving the Shore, he went aboard of the <HI>Vlaerding</HI> Frigat, and left the chief Command to Captain <HI>Poleman,</HI> the second to <HI>Schimmel Penny,</HI> and to <HI>Bittar</HI> the third, of the sixteen Companies then ashore, <HI>viz.</HI> six under the first, and five apiece under the other two. The Camp was also in good Order, their Sconces finish'd, their Guns planted, and a Breast-work rais'd with Planks, that if occasion should require, they might easily cast up Earth against it. The <HI>Nut-tree, Naer|den, Mars, Flushing, Buiksloot,</HI> with the <HI>Quemuy</HI> Jonk, remain'd there at an An|chor. In the Evening the Admiral, follow'd by one of the <HI>Tartar</HI> Jonks, set Sail, and the next Morning, without having gain'd much Ground, because of the strong Tyde towards the South, he came to an Anchor about half a League to the Southward of <HI>Tankoya.</HI></P>
<P>The six <HI>Chinese</HI> Hostages, which were left in stead of the three <HI>Hollanders</HI> that went by Land to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> related and declar'd at the drinking of a Cup of <HI>Tee</HI> with the Admiral, That most of the <HI>Chineses</HI> which were then an <HI>For|mosa,</HI> were not inclin'd to stay there long, but much rather would go to the Coast of <HI>China</HI> their native Countrey where they had Friends, and submit themselves to the <HI>Tartars;</HI> That the old <HI>Coxinga</HI> came to <HI>Formosa</HI> with his Sol|diers, none was to be blam'd but one <HI>Pinqua,</HI> who was the onely Person that advis'd him to it: and since they did not find it on <HI>Formosa</HI> as they had been told; but on the contrary, lost a great many of their Men in the War and Sickness, occasion'd from the unwholsom Air: and besides, having now lost <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> therefore the <HI>Chineses</HI> do not at all esteem of this <HI>Pinqua:</HI> nay, the Soldiers and others have desir'd to cut his Flesh alive from his Bones, and every one eat a piece of it, if it might have been permitted.</P>
<P>In the Evening the <HI>Ionker</HI> Frigat, sent from the Haven of <HI>Tayowan</HI> by the Vice-Admiral <HI>Lairesse,</HI> brought a Letter to the Admiral from the <HI>Chinese</HI> Go|vernors, which was to this effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>We the Governors of <HI>Formosa, Gamia, Siautongsiong, Koulavja, Anglavja, Owilavja, Tanlavja,</HI> and another <HI>Tanlavja,</HI> write in their Names this Letter to the Lord Admiral.</OPENER>
<P>WE desire nothing but Peace. We have receiv'd Letters from the <HI>Tartar,</HI> but will not hearken to it, nor have any thing to do with him. You write in Your Letter, which We have receiv'd, to send You two Agents. It is
<PB N="162" REF="97">
true, We have lost <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> and also <HI>Goutsoe,</HI> but We care not for them; for we deserted them freely, and suffer'd the <HI>Tartars</HI> to come into them. We have fought against the same <HI>Tartars,</HI> and slain <HI>Bethetok,</HI> and other of their Officers. They have, 'tis true, destroy'd and burnt the Towns and Habitati|ons upon the Islands <HI>Eymuy, Quemuy,</HI> and <HI>Goutsoe,</HI> and pull'd down some of the Fortresses, but have not had the courage to keep them, so that We very well know what People they are. In former times You <HI>Hollanders</HI> have En|gag'd with Us in the <HI>Piscadores, Baxembay,</HI> and <HI>Loakkau;</HI> so that We know Your<NOTE PLACE="marg">By the <HI>Hollanders</HI> call'd <HI>The Straights of</HI> Tayowan.</NOTE> Customs, and You Ours. We have lost the Fight at <HI>Quemuy,</HI> and suffer'd Our Cities there to be taken by them, but this was done by Your help: We have lost a great many Men on Our part; but also know, that You likewise have had some loss. But now a Letter is brought to Me by two <HI>Mandarins</HI> from <HI>Sepoan,</HI> commanding that We shall endeavor to make Peace with You, and give You a Place to Trade in; Therefore if You are willing to agree with Us on that account, or not, let Us know with speed. As to what con|cerns Us, We have order from <HI>Sepoan</HI> to agree with the Admiral, that We may live as Friends and Brothers. We have also understood by Your Letter, that if We do not send Agents to You in two days, that then You will use Hostility against Us; seeing Your Writing was somewhat harsh, We have thought Your Proposal to be of like kind. But if You are minded to agree, We will grant Your Requests, and make a beginning whilst the two Agents from <HI>Sepoan</HI> are here; therefore what the one hath to say to the other ought now to be known. The Letter written by the Lord-Admiral to the Prisoners We have deliver'd to them: If You will not credit Us, send <HI>Assam</HI> ashore to examine the truth.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This Letter was Seal'd with <HI>Owiden</HI>'s Seal, in the Title call'd <HI>Owilavia.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty ninth the Admiral set Sail again with the <HI>Ionker</HI> Frigat, but the <HI>Tartar</HI> Jonks went back.</P>
<P>The thirtieth in the Morning the Admiral was got two Leagues to the Northward of the <HI>Cape</HI> of <HI>Tankoya,</HI> where by contrary Tydes he was again forc'd to an Anchor; and by two Persons that came from <HI>Tayowan,</HI> he recei|ved a Letter from the young <HI>Coxinga,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Sepoan</HI> and <HI>Kimsia,</HI> who at that time resided on <HI>Tangsoa.</HI> They also proffer'd the Admiral as a Present, twenty Pieces of Silk Stuffs, four Frails of <HI>Iapan</HI> Tobacco, and ten <HI>Iapan</HI> Ap|ples, which he modestly refus'd, except the Apples.</P>
<P>In this Letter nothing more was proffer'd the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> than the Island <HI>Lamoa,</HI> as appears more at large by the Letter it self, as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<P><HI>TSiovan,</HI> a Servant to <HI>Tsioubontok,</HI> is come back, and hath brought good tydings from the Lord-Admiral with a Relation, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were inclin'd to make Peace with us. We have receiv'd the Letter from the Admiral written to the <HI>Netherland</HI> Prisoners, and understood the Contents of it. I much rejoyce at the great love which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> bear to their Prison|ers. In the last Southern <HI>Mouson,</HI> the <HI>Hollanders</HI> coming with Ships into the <HI>Piscadores,</HI> they deliver'd a Letter to the <HI>Mandarin,</HI> who durst not of himself take upon him to grant what they desir'd, therefore he hath sent the Letter to Me, on which I sent one to the Admiral; wherein I desire to make Peace with the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> But my Letter coming to the <HI>Piscadores,</HI> they were gone from thence with their Ships to <HI>Hoksieu.</HI> On the Admirals coming with his Ships to <HI>Quemuy,</HI> a Servant was sent from <HI>Tsioubontok,</HI> or <HI>Tonbeenpek,</HI> with a Letter to the
<PB N="163" REF="97">
<HI>Holland</HI> Admiral; to which he had sent Answer, That he had agreed with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and therefore could not make Peace with the <HI>Chineses;</HI> nor that he had any reason to break the League with them; Therefore because we could not then agree with you we Fought together: in which Fight indeed a great many Rusticks were kill'd in <HI>Quemuy:</HI> but we suppose that some of the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> were also slain. Our intentions were not to Fight with them, but we thought to have made Peace. All the Villagers on the Islands, and those which dwell along the Sea-Coast, have been under my subjection. I al|so lov'd them, as I do your Nation. Therefore I send two <HI>Mandarins, Houpou-Thousou-Iapien,</HI> and <HI>Lungeugia Tsiouki,</HI> whom I have commanded to endeavor to agree with you; and we hope, you will not be backward in agreeing with us, which will be good for both, because we shall make good advantage by your Trade. If we agree, then you <HI>Hollanders</HI> must forsake the <HI>Tartars</HI> Friendship, that we may not fear them; and when the Peace is concluded, we will give you the Island <HI>Lamoa,</HI> and deliver you your Prisoners; then we can Trade to|gether, and you come with your Ships to us, and we with ours to you; which to testifie that I mean it from my heart, I take the Heavens to witness.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The Messengers that brought this Letter related, That they had first been in the <HI>Piscadores,</HI> and from thence, according to their Orders, came five days since to <HI>Tayowan:</HI> but they should have been there before, had not the bad Weather detain'd them some days at <HI>Tangsoa.</HI> Moreover, they had heard six days before, that the three <HI>Netherland</HI> Agents were on their Way to <HI>Tayowan;</HI> and also that all the Prisoners were in good health.</P>
<P>The Admiral told them, That if they desir'd the Island <HI>Lamoa,</HI> they could have that when they pleas'd, and needed not their Proffer: and also told them, That they did not maintain the War against them for <HI>Lamoa,</HI> but for <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Tayowan.</HI></P>
<P>To which they reply'd, If their Master <HI>Sepoan</HI> did not rightly understand their Desires, it was not his nor their fault; for the <HI>Netherland</HI> Prisoners had so explain'd his Letter to them, that he demanded the Island <HI>Lamoa:</HI> alledg|ing, If the <HI>Hollanders</HI> wanted <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>Tayowan,</HI> they should not have taken the Islands <HI>Eymuy, Quemuy, Goutsoe,</HI> and others thereabouts, from them.</P>
<P>Then the Admiral ask'd if they had no Commands besides the Letter, to declare any thing else to the <HI>Hollanders?</HI> whereupon they answering <HI>No,</HI> the Admiral told them, That the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> would on those terms never make Peace with them.</P>
<P>Whereupon they reply'd again, That they might do as they saw fit: for if they could not agree, they would go and submit themselves to the <HI>Tartar,</HI> and desire of Him not to grant them to Trade there. But these Threats the Ad|miral not regarding, told them again, That if they were not yet weary of the War, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> would not be tir'd with using their Armes, till they had ut|terly extirpated them.</P>
<P>Whereupon the <HI>Coxingans</HI> observing that they could avail nothing by harsh Speeches, after a little consideration desir'd the Admiral to pass by all those Discourses, for they would rather live in Friendship than at Variance, and therefore were sent to Treat; and to that end desir'd that he would be pleas'd to go with his Ship to the Harbor of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> where (after they had
<PB N="164" REF="98">
consulted with the Governor) they doubted not, but they should give him full satisfaction; To which the Admiral made answer, That he would endeavor to get with his Ship to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> and that then he would expect their sudden an|swer, what they intended to do; and if they would manifest their good in|tention, they should bring some of their Prisoners along with them, that the Admiral might know the reason, why they had not written to him since he came thither, because it created suspicious thoughts in him of their Welfare. Then the Admiral as'd them, Why they did not send their Prisoners to them according to the Agreement at the Delivery of <HI>Tayowan:</HI> To which they re|ply'd, That they were ready to have deliver'd them, if they had been deman|ded; but because that was not done, they remain'd still in their power.</P>
<P>But after they had promis'd the Admiral at their return to bring one of the <HI>Netherland</HI> Prisoners with them, and had been kindly entertain'd, taking their leave, they went to the Shore, and so from thence to <HI>Tayowan</HI> by Land.</P>
<P>The six <HI>Chinese</HI> Hostages that were aboard the Admiral, and had the day be|fore told him that most of the <HI>Chineses</HI> were not inclin'd to stay on <HI>Formosa,</HI> but would rather submit to the <HI>Tartar;</HI> inform'd the Interpreter <HI>Maurice,</HI> that some desir'd to stay and live there, of whom several were Persons of Quality.</P>
<P>The one and thirtieth, the Admiral came with the <HI>Vlaerding</HI> Frigat half a League Southward of <HI>Sakkam,</HI> and the next day Anchor'd in the Harbor of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> before the Castle of <HI>Zelandia.</HI></P>
<P>The second against Noon, the Interpreter <HI>Melman</HI> came aboard the Admiral<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> in a <HI>Chinese Champan,</HI> with a Letter from the Agents Lieutenant <HI>Hendrik Noorden,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Renaldus,</HI> written in <HI>Tayowan</HI> the Night before, in which they inform'd the Admiral, That after the twenty eighth of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> having remov'd with the Army under <HI>Siautongsiong</HI>'s Command, they Rode to <HI>Sakkam,</HI> where coming on the twenty ninth, on the thirtieth they were courteously entertain'd at <HI>Tay|owan,</HI> but forbidden to speak with the <HI>Netherland</HI> Prisoners.</P>
<P>The next day after their arrival in <HI>Tayowan,</HI> they had Audience granted them from the Governor <HI>Ouwilavia,</HI> before whom they were commanded, ac|cording to the <HI>Chinese</HI> manner to kneel, which they refus'd.</P>
<P>Whereupon <HI>Ouwilavia</HI> having caus'd them to be ask'd, to what end they came to him; and being told that it was to know how he was inclin'd to agree with them, he answer'd, That he referr'd himself to the Letter written by the <HI>Ne|therland</HI> Prisoners, on the sixth of <HI>October</HI> last to the Admiral; and then ask'd the Agents, if they had any thing else to say? Whereupon the Agents, accord|ing to their instructions read the Proposals, which he would no ways hearken to; but said, That they were unreasonable, and not fit to be answer'd, aver|ring, that the Admiral himself had written to the <HI>Netherland</HI> Prisoners, that he would be contented with <HI>Lamoa,</HI> whereupon they parted at that time.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>February,</HI> the <HI>Holland</HI> Agents met with those of <HI>Sepoan,</HI> where the Letter written by the Admiral and his Council, the one and twentieth of <HI>Octo|ber,</HI> to the <HI>Holland</HI> Prisoners, and in which they thought to shew, That the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> would have been satisfi'd only with <HI>Lamoa,</HI> was produc'd, which the Agents explain'd quite another way, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Lamoa</HI> in comparison to the other places that were proffer'd to the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> signifi'd nothing, and that they were no ways satisfi'd with it.</P>
<P>Mean while, being met together, the <HI>Holland</HI> Agents said, That they had understood aboard of their Ships, how their Prisoners were us'd to hard labor, nay, that they doubted whether they were yet living; they to manifest

the contrary, brought them all out of the Castle into a Court, where the A|gents look'd upon them at a distance, but were not permitted to speak to them. At last, the Agents were directed to tell the Admiral, that the <HI>Mandarins</HI> of <HI>Se|poan</HI> were ready to go again to the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> and that he might now send a Letter with them to <HI>Sepoan,</HI> and make mention of some other place, and not speak any more of <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa,</HI> for they were resolv'd not to hear any more of it.</P>
<P>While Affairs stood in this posture, the <HI>Chineses</HI> told <HI>Melman,</HI> That they would not deliver the Castle of <HI>Formosa,</HI> unless forc'd by necessity, which they concluded with a Challenge, That if the <HI>Hollanders</HI> would give them a meet|ing at <HI>Sakkam,</HI> they would fairly try their Valor, and fight them Hand to Hand in <HI>Champain;</HI> and if they wanted Boats, would supply them with their own <HI>Champans,</HI> to Land as many as had a stomach to the Invitation; and if their fortune were such (which they did not fear) to loose the day, they would de|liver up the Forts, and whatever else they desir'd; But if they got the better, which they could not doubt, yet they would be ready to a compliance; and laying all animosities aside, joyn in an everlasting League of Amity.</P>
<P>The <HI>Netherlanders</HI> seeing by this, that the <HI>Chinese</HI> Governors on <HI>Tayowan</HI> had sleighted the propos'd Articles, and commanded their Trustees not to make any further mention of surrendring, judg'd it convenient presently to send for their Agents, and break off the Treaty; only Commanding, that they should tell the <HI>Chineses</HI> at their departure, that since they had sleighted his Proposals, they must now make their Addresses to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and accordingly sent them this Letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>BY the Letter of Our Agents which We receiv'd aboard this day, and also by the Relation given Us by the Interpreter, We understand, that you will not hearken to the surrender of <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa;</HI> and since We are not impower'd without that, to conclude of any thing; therefore We desire you to send Our Agents, and to receive yours, desiring Almighty God to give you a righter understanding of your own good, that you may not deceive your selves, trusting too much in your own Strength and Valor.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This Letter the Interpreter <HI>Melman</HI> carry'd with Orders to answer their Challenge thus by word of Mouth, that if they were so hardy, to try their Fortune with the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and put it to the hazard of a Set-day, thanking them for the offer of their <HI>Champans,</HI> they would (if they wanted Boats) rather swim to Shore, to give them their desir'd satisfaction; and though they knew their Valor, they should be allow'd to bring two thousand into the Field against their one; and also they would spare their trouble of coming to <HI>Sak|kam,</HI> by giving them a meeting and smart Entertainment at the half way.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> Agents now resolv'd to return, sent one of their Servants to <HI>Baxemboy,</HI> with Order, to deliver some Letters there, and Demand answers of those sent from <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi:</HI> But he return'd soon after with an Ar|row in his side; which the <HI>Chineses,</HI> when they perceiv'd that he was a <HI>Tartar,</HI> had given him ashore; nay, according to his own saying, they would have ta|ken his Life, had he not sav'd himself by Swimming to his <HI>Champan.</HI></P>
<P>On the fourth in the forenoon, the Interpreter <HI>Melman</HI> came a second time with a Letter from the <HI>Netherland</HI> Agents to the Admiral; and also one from the <HI>Chinese</HI> Governors, in Answer to that, written to them on the second in|stant, which Translated, was to this effect.</P>

<P>The <HI>Holland</HI> Agents now desiring to return, were not permitted, but in stead thereof, jealousies daily increasing, a Guard was set upon them; where|fore the <HI>Dutch</HI> Prisoners earnestly desir'd in their Letters, That the Admiral would first use some mild way for their Deliverance, that they might not al|ways live as Exiles amongst a Crew of <HI>Heathens,</HI> and their Wives and Children in <HI>Batavia,</HI> as miserable Widows and Orphans.</P>
<P><HI>Melman</HI> the Interpreter, according to the Admiral's Directions, deliver'd the Challenge, but receiv'd no other answer than, <HI>Very well;</HI> and inform'd them, that at his return to the Fleet, without the Castle they had lately Planted along the Shore about twenty Iron and Brass Cannon. Upon this Intelligence, <HI>Siau|tongsiong</HI>'s Commissioners perceiv'd that all things were not right ashore, and therefore believ'd, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> would not send them before their Agents came back; neither did they desire them to go ashore there, but requested, that they might be sent to <HI>Siautongsiong</HI> at <HI>Tankoya,</HI> from whence they were brought, fearing their Landing there might cost them their Lives; the rather, because <HI>Siautongsiong</HI> refus'd to go to <HI>Sakkam</HI> or <HI>Tayowan;</HI> therefore if he deser|ted those of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> the Agents believ'd that he would joyn with the <HI>Hollan|ders;</HI> for the Letter from those of <HI>Tayowan</HI> to <HI>Siautongsiong</HI> seem'd to express, That <HI>Sepoan</HI> had submitted to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> reforming his Hair, and sending for all his Soldiers and Officers from <HI>Formosa,</HI> with Commands, that they should come thence, and surrender up the Countrey to the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P>But the contrary soon appearing, rais'd in the Agents a further suspect, and as many jealousies in the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> so that now the whole business was how to contrive home their Agents; and to that purpose, concluded to write to the Governors of <HI>Formosa,</HI> that since they could not surrender up the Castle in <HI>Tay|owan,</HI> and the Fort in <HI>Sakkam,</HI> they would go to Treat with <HI>Kimsia</HI> or <HI>Sepoan</HI> him|self at <HI>Tangsoa,</HI> and there to see if they could come to better terms with him:
<PB N="167" REF="99">
This Message they sent, with design to get their Agents, but never intending any such matter as the performance of it; and accordingly the <HI>Chineses</HI> believing it, dismiss'd the Agents, who upon the sixth in the afternoon came at last aboard again, with the Interpreter <HI>Melman,</HI> and a Letter written to the Admiral from the Governors in <HI>Tayowan</HI> to this effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>The Governors of <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa, Gam-lavja, Siaulavja, Koulovja, An|lavja, Ouwilavja, Tanlavja,</HI> and a second <HI>Tanlavja,</HI> send in their Names this Letter to the <HI>Hollands</HI> Admiral.</OPENER>
<P>WE have perceiv'd by the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Letter, that they are of an upright Heart, though they suspected We would detain those they sent to Treat with Us, as appears by their last, which is contrary to Our Custom, and their Opinion, who ever put it into their Heads, for We have sent them freely of Our own accords, without the Formality of meeting half way, and exchang|ing Ours for theirs, whereby you may perceive Our Integrity, and that We never had any such design: We repose the like Confidence in you, and know that you will not fail Us in Our expectations.</P>
<P>You (as We have understood by your Letters) will intreat <HI>Sepoan</HI> to send a <HI>Mandarin</HI> with you to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and there to agree with your King, which We will acquaint <HI>Sepoan</HI> with, who knows best what is fittest for him in Honor to do: You have also receiv'd from <HI>Sepoan</HI> himself a Letter, to which be pleas'd to send an Answer, because he will not Treat without Letters of Credence.</P>
<P>We also advise, that if you intend to Treat at <HI>Tongsoa,</HI> with Our Prince, that you would inform Us punctually of the time, that We may give him notice of your coming, and that he may the better prepare Jonks to Convoy you in|to safe Harbors, to prevent the loosing and endangering of your Ships.</P>
<P>We have no more to say, but desire Our Commissioners may be sent to Us in this Vessel.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>Hereupon the <HI>Chinese</HI> Agents were sent ashore, not to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> but accord|ing to their Request to the Southward of the fresh River in <HI>Formosa.</HI> The Ad|miral also Order'd <HI>Melman</HI> to bid the Men that belong'd to the <HI>Champan,</HI> tell the Governors, That if they desir'd a Letter from him, they should send for it the next day.</P>
<P>The Agents <HI>Henrick Van Noorden,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Renaldus</HI> being come aboard of the Admiral again, inform'd them, That the Quarters in <HI>Tayowan,</HI> except two or three Houses, lay Ruin'd, and were nothing but a heap of Rubbish; but on the contrary, that <HI>Sakkam</HI> was much inlarg'd with Houses, and that they had seen few Cattel as they past along.</P>
<P>The seventh, two hours before day, according to their resolution taken the last Night, the Admiral set Sail with seven Frigats to the Point of <HI>Tankoya,</HI> where about Noon he Anchor'd amongst the rest of the Fleet.</P>
<P>Soon after the Admiral's arrival there, Captain <HI>Poleman</HI> coming to him, told him, That all things were well on the Shore, only some few Soldiers were sick, of which some dy'd, and the Distemper increas'd. He added also, that that very day, a Captain call'd <HI>Lita</HI> and twenty six Soldiers with their Arms, came from the <HI>Chineses</HI> with two Colours, and one Pennon to us, to go over with our Ships to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> and offer'd to fight for us against the Enemy; with promise also to get more to their Party.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="100">This Captain <HI>Lita</HI> gave Information, that <HI>Siautongsiong</HI> did not in the least in|tend<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chineses</HI> come over to the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></NOTE> to come to them, but at one time or other, would set upon them, if he could find a fit opportunity; and that the Enemies Forces on <HI>Formosa</HI> consist|ed in ten thousand Arm'd Men, of which near five thousand belong'd to this <HI>Siautongsiong,</HI> whereof he kept about him a Guard of fifteen hundred Men, the rest were distributed, some about the River <HI>Tamsuy,</HI> but the greatest part a|bout <HI>Iokan.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening, there came six Soldiers more, belonging to the foremention'd <HI>Lita,</HI> as on the next day twenty five more, furnish'd with Coats of Mail, Hel|mets, and Scythes; and about Noon nine more, each of them only with a Scythe, who had stood on the Inland Water, making signs to be fetch'd over to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Camp; and as they related, had been forc'd to throw away their Coats and Helmets, or else they could not have gotten through the Woods.</P>
<P>The foremention'd Captain <HI>Lita,</HI> was according to Order Presented by Ca|ptain <HI>Poleman,</HI> with four Pieces of <HI>Cangans</HI> or Clothing, to distribute amongst his Soldiers.</P>
<P>The tenth came ten other <HI>Chinese</HI> Soldiers, belonging to <HI>Lita</HI>'s Company, with Tidings, That the Enemy on the other side did fortifie and strengthen himself very much; to which purpose he had already gotten a great number of Baskets to be us'd as blinds, and plac'd them ready for the first opportunity to lay Guns betwixt them, and that then they threatned to come, and set upon the <HI>Netherlanders.</HI></P>
<P>There also came four <HI>Chineses</HI> from <HI>Siautongsiong,</HI> into the <HI>Dutch</HI> Camp, and in their Masters Name, presented the Admiral with two <HI>Kings Fish,</HI> and a Bas|ket with Potatoes; in like manner, two other <HI>Chineses</HI> came to the Camp, who brought some dry'd Fish and other Provisions to sell, which <HI>Poleman</HI> took in exchange for a <HI>Cangang;</HI> but because it was suppos'd that they were sent as Spies, none of them was permitted to come within the Works.</P>
<P>The eleventh came four other <HI>Chineses,</HI> who affirm'd what the ten which came the day before had related, concerning the Enemies Fortifying himself.</P>
<P>Those <HI>Chineses</HI> that came thus to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> (to prevent them from act|ing any mischief) were divided amongst the <HI>Overveen, Buiksloot,</HI> and <HI>Cogge</HI> Fri|gats, and their Arms taken away from them, <HI>viz.</HI> thirty in the <HI>Cogge,</HI> nine in the <HI>Buiksloot,</HI> and twenty six in the <HI>Overveen.</HI></P>

<P>Pray Credit my Writing, for I mean all what is here before mention'd with an upright Heart, therefore I desire it may be kept private; please to send <HI>As|sam</HI> to Me, that I may hear from him what your intentions are; if that can|not be, send your Resolution in Writing, that I may Govern my self ac|cordingly.</P>

<P>The same Messenger brought also two little Letters from <HI>Siautongsiong,</HI> as he pretended to the <HI>Tartar</HI> Agents; but being broken open by the Admiral, one was found to be to <HI>Tonganpek,</HI> and the other to <HI>Sibja;</HI> yet both of the follow|ing Contents.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe Letter sent to Me by your Servant <HI>Gom,</HI> I have receiv'd and under|stood your meaning; My inclinations, as you very well know, were always to leave this State and come over to the <HI>Tartars;</HI> but to do it accord|ing to your writing with the <HI>Holland</HI> Ships, I am something doubtful, fearing they might carry Me to <HI>Holland,</HI> or elsewhere: Besides there is no conveniency for My Wives and Children, neither for My Arms in those Ships, for I am near five thousand strong with My Soldiers and Officers, which are all ready and willing to come over to you; wherefore I hereby desire you, to be importu|nate with <HI>Singlamong,</HI> that his great Jonks with the <HI>Holland</HI> Ships may be sent at farthest on the fifteenth day of the second Moneth, either to <HI>Tamsuy</HI> or <HI>Tan|koya;</HI> upon whose timely appearance, I will immediately put aboard My Com|manders, Wives and Children; as for the Soldiers it is no great matter, they may go in the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ships: I intend to send my Grand-father to speak with you farther about this Concern, which I desire you to keep secret.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The Admiral, by the Vice-Admiral's and Rere-Admiral's advice, return'd this Answer.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>FRom your Writing, I understand anew your desire of five thousand Tail, which had you come to Us with your Soldiers, they had been paid be|fore this time, according as We proffer'd: But to be plain with you, We sus|pect all your Actions, which are clandestinely manag'd; you holding a Cor|respondence at <HI>Tayowan,</HI> though you pretend and desire of Us, that your Letter may be kept private.</P>
<P>We had also thought to have found more fair Dealings in the Governors of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> and if you were really resolv'd to go to the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> you would not have trifled so long, but sent some Persons of Quality to Us, to have been carry'd in one of Our Ships to <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi;</HI> but since We cannot by fair means, We will endeavor to bring you and those of <HI>Tayowan</HI> both to bet|ter Terms by force.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="101">The twelfth in the Evening, Captain <HI>Poleman</HI> with eleven Companies being in Arms, the Guns and other Ammunition was in the Night brought aboard from the Point of <HI>Tankoya;</HI> and the next day all the Tents were pull'd down and put into the Ships; and soon after the Sea-men and Soldiers that had been appointed to stay ashore, came from thence aboard.</P>
<P>The thirteenth in the afternoon, the Admiral assembled his Council to con|sult what they should do further, and Propos'd, That since they had no place of meeting there, nor on the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> whither they should go with the whole Fleet, to see what condition the Forts were in at <HI>Goutsoe,</HI> and if they could be repair'd with little cost and trouble, then to Pitch there for the present, that they might have a place of Rendezvouz upon any occasion, and also might leave there some Frigats, to go out in the beginning of the approaching Sou|thern <HI>Mouson,</HI> to Cruise for the <HI>Iapan</HI> Traders.</P>
<P>Secondly, If they should fall short of <HI>Goutsoe,</HI> whether it were convenient, and the time would permit them to venture a design on the Isles <HI>Lamoa</HI> or <HI>Tang|soa,</HI> and from thence send the Cruising Frigats.</P>
<P>Thirdly, If they should directly Steer from thence to <HI>Batavia,</HI> with the greatest part of the Fleet, and send only three or four Frigats with the hundred <HI>Chineses,</HI> and their Captain with the two <HI>Tartar</HI> Jonks to the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> ac|cording to their promise to <HI>Singlamong.</HI></P>
<P>These Proposals being duly weigh'd and consider'd, at last they Resolv'd,</P>
<P>First, To examine, how the Fleet was stor'd with Provisions, Ammunition, Soldiers and Sea-men, and then they might on better ground and with more safety, consult what they had best to do, and accordingly the whole Fleet were found to be two thousand and seventy eight Men, (nine hundred and sixty Sol|diers, and one thousand one hundred and eighteen Sea-men;) besides an hun|dred and two Soldiers, and an hundred and thirty Sea-men that were sick; the number of those that were dead, was two hundred and eleven in all.</P>
<P>The fourteenth the <HI>Tartars</HI> fetch'd twenty three more from the Shore that came running to them with their Arms, and in their <HI>Champans</HI> carry'd them aboard the <HI>Vlaerding</HI> Frigat.</P>
<P>The same day a Party of the Enemies Horse and Foot, consisting in about three or four hundred appear'd upon the Shore, but durst not come within Shot of the nearest Frigat; and towards Evening they march'd away again.</P>
<P>The fifteenth they agree'd to send four Frigats, under the Command of the Rere-Admiral <HI>Verwei,</HI> to the Coast of <HI>China;</HI> and that the Admiral should with the rest of the Ships go to <HI>Batavia:</HI> The Orders which <HI>Verwei</HI> was to observe, were to this Effect.</P>
</LETTER>
<LETTER>
<P>TO Conduct the two <HI>Tartar</HI> Ionks home that came with the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> from <HI>China</HI> to <HI>Formosa,</HI> and also to put ashore in <HI>China,</HI> the Renegade <HI>Chineses,</HI> being an hundred and two, besides their Captain; therefore to use all means to reach the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> and if possible, to get to <HI>Puthai,</HI> and Land them there; or if by con|trary Winds be could not reach <HI>Puthai,</HI> then to run to <HI>Chinchieuw.</HI></P>
<P>To stay on the Coast till the last of <HI>February,</HI> and wait for an Answer to the Admirals Letter, which he had given the Rere-Admiral to send by the Renegade <HI>Chineses</HI> to deliver to <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi;</HI> and if he receiv'd no Answer in that time, to go thence, without any longer delay towards <HI>Batavia,</HI> whither the Admiral would set Sail with the rest of the Fleet before.</P>

<P>WE hop'd that the <HI>Chinese</HI> Forces which remain on <HI>Tayowan</HI> and <HI>Formosa,</HI> would have accepted of your Excellencies Proffer, and accordingly come over to Us to be conveigh'd to <HI>China.</HI> To the Letters written by your Highness to that purpose to them, We added another, to assure them of Our Integrity and Care, We would manifest in the carrying over and furnishing them with Provisions, which was deliver'd by your Excellencies Agents to <HI>Si|autongsiong,</HI> General of the Forces in the South part of <HI>Formosa,</HI> who pretended to be satisfi'd therewith, and began to Treat with Us, and Demanded five thousand Tail of Silver beforehand. But We observing, that if he should once have gotten the Money, he would have deceiv'd Us, therefore We would not consent to it; however, upon his assurance, that <HI>Sepoan,</HI> otherwise nam'd <HI>Kim|sia</HI> their Prince, had agreed with your Excellencies, and submitted himself to his Imperial Majesty, We dispatch'd Agents to him, and I also went from <HI>Tan|koya</HI> thither by Sea.

Mean while Captain <HI>Lita</HI> submitted, and brought with him an hundred Men, which We have sent your Highness with this Letter, had your Excellencies sent your Jonks with Us, many more would have come over; for they pretend, that they dare not venture themselves in Our Ships: We will be here again from <HI>Batavia</HI> (whither We are now going) with a strong Fleet and Forces in the Southern <HI>Mouson,</HI> when We hope your Highnesses will also be ready, that We may fall upon the Enemy in <HI>Tangsoa</HI> and <HI>Lamoa,</HI> or where ever else he shall be, that so We may at once make an end of the Work.</P>

<P>I receiv'd your Letter at <HI>Tayowan;</HI> but the sudden departure of your Messengers would not afford me Opportunity of sending an Answer. We did at your Request send Commissioners to <HI>Tayowan;</HI> but when they motion'd the Surrender of the Fort, they had a Guard put upon them. We always believ'd, that it was free for Us to ask, and you to deny, without such Af|fronts. <HI>Tsiautongsiong</HI> made Us believe, That your Highness had submitted to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and commanded all your Souldiers from <HI>Formosa,</HI> with Order to deliver the Countrey to Us: Whereupon We sent Our Agents, as afore|mention'd: But when We receiv'd your Letter, We understood the contrary; for you advis'd Us to break Our League with the <HI>Tartar,</HI> and proffer'd Us onely <HI>Lamoa</HI> for a Factory, and the Releasing of Our Prisoners: In answer to which, We advise you to unite with the <HI>Tartar,</HI> and deliver <HI>Tayowan</HI> to Us, that We may live peaceably together, and Trade flourish afresh, which you very well know is Our chief aim. I much wonder why those of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> while Our Agents were there, sent not to Me, and why yours never return'd to speak with Me; perhaps they may pretend Fear, but they have no reason, for with Us 'tis usual in the midst of the sharpest War, to send Persons to Treat, and make Overtures of Peace: And themselves are able to make out, how honourably We protected them: Whereas on the contrary, those of <HI>Tayowan</HI> were so barbarously uncivil, that they would not suffer Our Agents to speak with Our Prisoners, nor take a Letter from them to Us. I have set Sail from thence, with intention to come to you at <HI>Tangsoa,</HI> in hopes to find more Civility, and withal to perswade you to send Ambassadors to <HI>Batavia;</HI> but the stormy Weather hath spent so much of the time, that to My great sorrow I could not effect My desire: Therefore I have left this Letter with the <HI>Piscadoreans,</HI> to be sent to you with the first opportunity. If you resolve to send, do it with speed.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The twenty sixth the Admiral set Sail again with his ten Ships, and ran by the high <HI>Western Island:</HI> The twenty seventh he saw the Sands; and the twenty eighth, the <HI>Macau</HI> Islands. On one of these <HI>Macau</HI> Isles stands the City <HI>Macao,</HI> of whose Beginning and Plantation this is the Account.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> at first permitted the <HI>Portuguese</HI> to Traffick on a desolate Isle<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Original of the City <HI>Macao.</HI></NOTE> call'd <HI>Sancham,</HI> or <HI>Sancian,</HI> thirty Leagues from the Continent, and ten from <HI>Macao,</HI> where they built themselves, in stead of Houses, Bowers of plash'd Trees, and meanly thatch'd on the top. Here the <HI>Chineses</HI> came to Trade with them, after they were thus setled, nor would suffer their nearer Approaches, being terrified with the remembrance of the former Calamities they suffer'd by Invasions, especially of the <HI>Tartar</HI> in the Year 1208. yet fresh in their Me|mory. These their Fears and Jealousies increas'd upon them, by seeing and considering the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ships, what huge Vessels they were, like floating Castles, big with Armed Men, and terrifying both Sea and Land with the Voice of their thundering Guns&punc; Besides, the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> which in great numbers daily resorted to <HI>Canton,</HI> reported, That these People (meaning
<PB N="173" REF="102">
the <HI>Portuguese</HI>) were <HI>Franks</HI> (for so they call'd all <HI>Europeans</HI>) and were a mighty People of prodigious Valour, and Conquerors of whatever they design'd, and that the Borders of their Empire were extended to the Brims of the Universe. But though the <HI>Portuguese</HI> were thus represented, and appear'd themselves to be too formidable, yet the Avarice of the <HI>Chineses</HI> overpower'd their Fear; for the Benefit accrewing by this Commerce was so great, that it did not onely redound to the Emperors Advantage, but also the Magistrates and Common People were all Sharers; so that by Degrees they suffer'd it to be driven with|in their Dominions, yet with this <HI>Proviso,</HI> That so soon as their time of Sale was done, they should go again to <HI>India</HI> with their Commodities.</P>
<P>The <HI>Portuguese</HI> Merchants had Annually two Markets or Fairs, to buy what the <HI>Indian</HI> Ships transported in <HI>Ianuary,</HI> or the <HI>Iapanners</HI> in <HI>Iune.</HI></P>
<P>The Fairs or Markets were not kept in the Haven of <HI>Macao,</HI> nor on the Isle of <HI>Sancian,</HI> as in antient times; but in <HI>Canton</HI> it self, whither an infinite Com|pany of People resorted; for the <HI>Portuguese</HI> went from the City <HI>Macao,</HI> with the Magistrates leave of <HI>China,</HI> to the Metropolis <HI>Canton,</HI> two days Journey by Water, against Tyde, and lodg'd at Night in their Vessels in the Haven: Yet all things were done with such circumspection and vigilancy, that it was easie to see they were not without jealous Fits, and grudgings of their former Fear. These yearly Fairs continu'd two Months, and sometimes longer.</P>
<P>By this means that Place which was before desolate, began to be inhabited not onely by the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> but also by many of the neighboring People; so that in few Years, by the great abundance of Commodities brought thither out of <HI>Europe, India,</HI> and <HI>China</HI> it self, it grew a famous and populous City: Nay, such was the <HI>Chineses</HI> Covetousness, seeing their Wealth, that they not on|ly dwelt there, and Traded, but Married with them, and in a short time fill'd the whole Isle full of rich Habitations.</P>
<P>This Place is also famous amongst the Catholicks, for the great resort thither of Priests, and their converting the Natives to the <HI>Christian Faith.</HI> From hence all the Voyages for the Converting of <HI>Heathens</HI> were undertaken; as to <HI>Iapan, China, Tunking, Cochinchina, Cambaya, Laos,</HI> and other Countreys; where|fore the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> gave it the Title of a City, and by the approbation of the <HI>Pope</HI> rais'd it to an Episcopal See. But since the banishing of the <HI>Por|tuguese</HI> out of <HI>Iapan,</HI> this City hath much decreas'd.</P>
<P>The twenty ninth in the Night the Fleet reacht the East Point of the Isle <HI>Ai|nan,</HI> which, according to <HI>Bartholomew Verwei</HI>'s Observation, lies much more Nor|therly than it is plac'd in the general Map. On this Isle lies the City <HI>Ingly,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Ciunchew,</HI> being fortified with very strong Walls, full of hand|som Buildings, and well seated for Trade; the whole Island being in a manner surrounded with Mountains and Woods, produceth great plenty of all Necessa|ries for Humane Sustenance.</P>
<P>On the Mountains grows the sweet-smelling <HI>Craine</HI>-Wood, and likewise Ebony, Roses, and <HI>Brasile,</HI> much us'd by the Dyers through all <HI>China.</HI> There are also many <HI>Indian</HI> Nuts, and a Fruit by them call'd <HI>Iaca,</HI> which grows not on the Branches, but the Body of the Tree. Amongst others, there also grows a certain strange Herb, in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Chitung;</HI> for the Sea-men are of opinion, that they can find by its Joynts or Knobs, in what Month, and how many Storms there shall be in a whole Year, saying, The fewer Joynts this Herb hath, the less the number of Storms will be; and likewise from its Stalks that shoot out of the Joynts from the Root upwards, they judge in
<PB N="174" REF="103">
what Month it will be tempestuous Weather. The Island also breeds many Harts, and other wild and tame Beasts, besides abundance of Birds.</P>
<P>Near this Island they also fish for Pearls on the Northern Shore, between this and the Main Land. There is likewise a very strange Fish caught here, with four Eyes, and six Feet, which the <HI>Chineses</HI> affirm produces also Pearls.</P>
<P>There is yet another Monster in this Sea, whose Head resembles a Birds, all the rest a Fish, and yields, as they say, several Precious Stones.</P>
<P>Between the City <HI>Coacheu</HI> and the Isle of <HI>Hainan</HI> they catch some Sea-Crabs, which differ not much from the other, except in this, that as soon as they come out of the Water into the Air, they are turn'd into Stone, yet still keeping their former Shape. The <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>Chineses</HI> use them for Medicines against Burning Fevers.</P>
<P>On the Southside of this Isle the <HI>Chineses</HI> catch Whales, after the same man|ner as we do at <HI>Greenland.</HI></P>
<P>This Island hath divers Mountains towards the South side, whereof one call'd <HI>Kinim,</HI> hath a Quarry of red Marble.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Linkao,</HI> a little Town, there lies the Mountain <HI>Pisie,</HI> of which the <HI>Chineses</HI> tell strange Fictions; for they relate, That there was a Stag endued with Humane Reason, which conducted the Islanders Army through unknown ways, and brought them where they block'd up their Enemy, that came from <HI>Cochinchina</HI> to invade them, by which means they obtain'd a great Victory, and on the same place erected a Temple in his Honor.</P>
<P>Eastward of <HI>Cincheu</HI> is a Lake, where a City stood formerly, that was swal|low'd up by an Earthquake.</P>
<P>By the little Town <HI>Iai</HI> rises a Mountain, said to be so lofty, that neither Wind nor Rain reaches the top; and therefore call'd <HI>Hoeifung,</HI> that is, <HI>Above the Wind.</HI></P>
<P>It is very remarkable what the <HI>Chineses</HI> relate of the Sea near the Town <HI>Ci|um, viz.</HI> That it neither ebbs nor flows, which is observ'd at the neighboring Places; but runs one half of the Month towards the East, and the other half to the West.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Ingly</HI> is a Place of great Commerce, in which there are three Markets every day; one of which is held in a very large Place on the East side of the City, whither so soon as the Sun rises divers Merchants resort, as <HI>Arabians, Turks, Zurats, Malabars, Abyssines,</HI> and those of <HI>Pegu</HI> and <HI>Malaya,</HI> besides many of the Native Inhabitants, <HI>Indians,</HI> and <HI>Portuguese.</HI></P>
<P>After this Market is ended, which continues till nine a Clock, begins a se|cond, which is kept before the Governors Palace, and lasts till Noon, at which time every one retires home to their Dinners.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon about three a clock the third Market begins, in a Place at the South side of the City, where those Women (for the Females drive the Trade here, and not the Men) which sell several sorts of Goods, stand apart by themselves, and separated from one another; First stand in a row the Pepper-traders; next, those that sell <HI>Betel</HI> Leaves, <HI>Onekka,</HI> Water-Melons, and <HI>Anana's;</HI> and behind them the Book-sellers. In another Quarter are the Iron|mongers and Brasiers Shops, furnish'd with Armor, Poniards, Swords, and all sorts of Weapons, and likewise <HI>Sandal</HI>-Wood: Opposite to them stand such as vend Sugar, Honey, and all manner of Preserves: Not far distant is sold white, black, red, yellow, green, and gray Beans; and lastly appears a hand|som Square, where all sorts of Herbs, either for Food or Physical use, may be bought.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="103">Here also those Merchants which Trade in Linnen, and other Commodities by Whole-sale, have their Exchange; beyond which is a Market for Poultry, as Hens, Ducks, Pigeons, Parrots, and other Birds; and likewise of <HI>Cabrito's,</HI> or Goats.</P>
<P>Here are also three High Streets: In the first on the right side are some Jew|ellers, which sell Rubies, Hyacinths, and the like; on the left side, many <HI>Chi|nese</HI> Picture-drawers, intermix'd with such as sell divers Colours of Sowing-Silks, Silk and Damask Stuffs, Flannel, Sattin, Gold Wyre, Cloth of Tissue, Porcelane, Wax'd Baskets, Copper Basons, Pots, and Cans, great and small; Quicksilver, Chests, Writing-Paper of all Colours, Almanacks, Leaf-Gold in Books, Looking-glasses, Combs, Spectacles, Brimstone, <HI>Chinese</HI> Scymiters with wax'd Scabbards, <HI>China</HI>-Roots, Fans, and other Trifles. The second is full of Picture-Shops. The third is onely for private use. Passing on somewhat fur|ther, you come to the Fruit-Market, and through that into the Fish-Market; and from thence turning towards the left side, to the Shambles, beyond which is a peculiar Place, where the Women sell by Retail round and long Pepper, white and black Cloves, Nutmegs, Mace, Cubebs, Cinnamon, Cummin, Gin|ger, <HI>Zedoar, Sandal</HI>-Wood, Rhubarb, <HI>Galanga,</HI> Anniseeds, and the like: On the right side is the Rice-Market; close by which, the place where they sell Pots, Bags, Mats, and Salt; and opposite to it, on the left side, Oyl.</P>

<P>The eighth was publickly read an Order of the Council, by which it was commanded, That none, either there or at <HI>Batavia,</HI> should sell any of the <HI>Chi|nese</HI> Children which the Officers, Soldiers, or Sea-men had taken, either to <HI>Moors</HI> or <HI>Heathens:</HI> And for the better prevention thereof, it was order'd, That they should all be numbred; which Office was committed to the charge of <HI>Peter Suskens,</HI> Captain <HI>Adrian Mouldpenny,</HI> Secretary <HI>Henry Ysbrands,</HI> and <HI>Iohn Renaldus.</HI> This Order was <HI>verbatim</HI> as follows.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>SInce there are many <HI>Chinese</HI> Children, as well Females as Males, in the Fleet which be|long to the Officers, Sea-men, and Soldiers, whom We fear they may sell either here at <HI>Poele Timon,</HI> or when they come to <HI>Batavia,</HI> either to Idolaters or <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> which is neither fitting nor lawful for Us <HI>Christians,</HI> but strictly forbidden by Our Su|perior Magistrates: Therefore We give every one knowledge and warning, not to dispose of any of the Maids or Youths, or other <HI>Chineses,</HI> either here at <HI>Poele Timon,</HI> or <HI>Batavia,</HI> to <HI>Mahumetans</HI> or Idolaters, neither to barter nor give them away to such, on pain of those Punishments decreed for such Offences: And that such Misdoers may be found out, every one shall be oblig'd to give an Account of how many they have, to Our appointed Offi|cers, that they may take their Names in Writing: And this to be set up in all the Ships of the Fleet lying at an Anchor before <HI>Poele Timon.</HI> Dated the eighth of <HI>March,</HI> 1664.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The tenth it was concluded in the Council, That since there was not Pro|vision enough to be had for the Fleet, and that which was there, very dear, to go thence to the Isle of <HI>Laver,</HI> in hopes to be better provided: Towards which having weigh'd Anchor, they set Sail in the Evening, and about midnight ar|riv'd there. On his departure the Admiral left a Letter with the Inhabitants of <HI>Poele Timon,</HI> to deliver to the Rere-Admiral <HI>Verwei,</HI> in which he advis'd him of all what had hapned since they parted.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="104">The twelfth it was resolv'd in Council that Evening to proceed on their Voyage to <HI>Batavia;</HI> according to which, they weigh'd Anchor, and set Sail.</P>

<P>The fifteenth towards Night they pass'd by the Rock <HI>Frederick Hendrick,</HI> and towards Evening entred the <HI>Straights of Banka.</HI></P>
<P>The twentieth the Fleet stemm'd the <HI>Thousand Islands,</HI> and in the Evening Anchor'd in twenty eight Fathom, and were about three Leagues distant from the Isle of <HI>Edam.</HI></P>
<P>The next day, being the one and twentieth, the Fleet came to an Anchor at <HI>Batavia,</HI> with ten Ships. The <HI>Sea-hound</HI> Frigat, sent thither with the <HI>Quemuy</HI> Jonk, with Letters from the <HI>Piscadores,</HI> were also arriv'd there, and likewise two other Jonks.</P>
<P>Towards Evening the Admiral <HI>Balthazar Bort,</HI> Vice-Admiral <HI>Huibert de Lairesse,</HI> the Council of War, and Commanders of all the Ships, went ashore, and were courteously receiv'd by his Excellency the Lord <HI>Maetzuiker,</HI> who in|viting them to Dinner the next day, the Admiral related all his Adventures to him, deliver'd him also his Papers, and a List of the Prisoners and the <HI>Chinese</HI> Children, which were in all two hundred forty three; <HI>viz.</HI> fifty nine Men, a hundred forty eight Male Children, and thirty six Female.</P>
<P>Mean while the Rear-Admiral <HI>Bartholomew Verwei,</HI> who on the twenty fourth<NOTE PLACE="marg">The return of the five Ships, with the Rere-Ad|miral, from the Coast of <HI>China.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>February</HI> set Sail with four Ships from the <HI>Piscadores,</HI> to the Coast of <HI>China,</HI> to transport the revolted <HI>Chineses,</HI> and land them about <HI>Puthay,</HI> or the River <HI>Chincheo,</HI> the twenty sixth came to an Anchor at the Island <HI>Colongsoe,</HI> where he desir'd the <HI>Tartar</HI> Agents, that they would with one of their Vessels fetch away the <HI>Chineses;</HI> to which purpose he put the Agents ashore at the City <HI>Eymuy.</HI> The next day they brought a Jonk, into which they were put with their Arms, and likewise the Letters given to the Agents, to be deliver'd the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> and General <HI>Lipovi,</HI> with which the Agents went to the City <HI>Chincheo.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty eighth a <HI>Tartar</HI> Vessel came aboard the Rere-Admiral, in which was a shaven <HI>Chinese</HI> call'd <HI>Hionko,</HI> which had formerly liv'd in <HI>Batavia,</HI> and spoke <HI>Portuguese,</HI> who told him, That he was sent by <HI>Sitetok,</HI> with Request to <HI>Verwei,</HI> That he would please to come to him to <HI>Haytin</HI> (a Place about a League and a half from thence) to a Treat; but <HI>Verwei</HI> being sickly, put it off. This <HI>Hionko</HI> also related, That the Enemy with his Forces lay yet in <HI>Tangsoa,</HI> and durst not go to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> fearing the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships that lay before it; and that about fourteen days since, five thousand Men came to them in sixty Jonks, which then lay at <HI>Haytan;</HI> that the Commanders which came in the said Jonks desir'd to inhabit the Isles of <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> which if it were permitted them, the Prime of the <HI>Coxingans</HI> would come over to them: But the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> had denied, and would not hearken thereto, alledging, That when another <HI>Holland</HI> Fleet should come again on the Coast, they would then with|out any further trouble submit.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>March</HI> the <HI>Overveen, Cogge,</HI> and <HI>Buiksloot</HI> Frigats came to an An|chor by the Rere-Admiral.</P>
<P>The third, being <HI>Monday, Verwei</HI> set Sail with his four Ships, that according to Order he might proceed on his Voyage to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and in the Afternoon found himself half a League beyond the Island with the Hole; his Course South-South-West.</P>

<P>The same day in the Morning the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> went to <HI>Chinzieu,</HI> to receive the Enemies of the Isles <HI>Tamswa</HI> and <HI>Lamoa</HI> into Favor, except <HI>Kimsia,</HI> who was said to be gone to <HI>Tayowan.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Wednesday,</HI> the fifth, the General <HI>Lipovi</HI> went also to <HI>Chinzieu,</HI> that there with the Vice-Roy, he might receive the submitting <HI>Chineses</HI> into Favor; from whence he sent one of his <HI>Mandarins</HI> to the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> to Complement them, and tell them in his Name, That some Letters written by the Council of State for that Empire, were come to his Hands, and that theirs would soon follow. Not long after the General <HI>Lipovi</HI>'s Chief Secretary came also with a Copy of the Council of States Letter, which was to this effect.</P>

<P>WE <HI>Lepous</HI> have shew'd your Letter concerning the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Trading<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Copy of the Council of States Letter.</NOTE> here, to his Imperial Majesty.</P>

<P>The <HI>Piejapous</HI> have also shew'd yours written to them, to his Majesty.</P>
<P>The <HI>Conbon</HI> likewise hath written a Letter to the Emperor, That the pro|mis'd Ships were already come; and likewise the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Request concern|ing Trade.</P>
<P><HI>Povi</HI> hath also written to the <HI>Zoetaysins,</HI> That the <HI>Holland</HI> Admiral was come with his Fleet of War to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and that his Request was to come and Trade here once a Year, and also that he might have a Place granted for the building of a Store-house. The Express of the <HI>Conbon</HI> written to the <HI>Zoetaysins</HI> inform'd, That the <HI>Holland</HI> Admiral hath brought some Goods with him in his Ships, with Request that he may dispose of them to pay his Sol|diers.</P>
<P>On all the foremention'd Writings his Majesty made Answer, You, my Lords, go and consult first about this Business; then let me know your Opi|nions, and I will give you my further Answer.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="105">The <HI>Zoetaysins, Puejapous, Lepous, Ponpous,</HI> in humble Obedience to Your Imperial Majesty do certifie our Opinions in manner following.</P>
<P>We have look'd over antient Records, and find that it was never us'd to permit any Strangers to live in our Countrey, or build a Factory, much less to drive a constant Trade; therefore We suppose it ought not to be granted.</P>
<P>We also find, That in antient Times it hath been accustomed, that when any Strangers came to Complement the Emperor, their Goods which they brought with them were put into one of the Emperors own Store-houses, erected for that purpose, where one of Our <HI>Mandarins</HI> taking an Inventory thereof, sold them: But without Addresses to the Emperor with Presents, nothing was permitted.</P>
<P>But since the <HI>Holland</HI> Admiral comes hither to assist the Emperor against his Enemies, We think that by way of Compensation he may this one time be suffer'd to sell his Goods brought along with him, first obtaining Licence from the General <HI>Lipovi,</HI> and the <HI>Conbon</HI> in <HI>Hoksieu:</HI> But hereafter the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> shall first make their Addresses to the Emperor, before they shall sell their Goods.</P>

<P>I <HI>Conghy,</HI> the twenty seventh Day of the twelfth Moon, in the second Year of My Reign, permit the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to come every other Year and Trade: The other Points I am of the same Opinion as You, my Lords. These are the Words of the Emperor, according to which, and this Letter, you may govern your selves.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>In the translating of this Copy of the Council of States Letter, their man|ner of Stile was as much as possible could be imitated.</P>
<P>The foremention'd <HI>Lepous</HI> and <HI>Ponpous,</HI> which had written these Letters to <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi,</HI> are Judges and Councellors of Civil Affairs, as the <HI>Pie|japous</HI> are of Martial: The <HI>Zoetaysins</HI> are four Guardians in the time of his Fa|ther, plac'd over the young Emperor and Empire, to supervise Affairs during his Minority, being at the time of this Grant about twelve Years of Age.</P>
<P>The tenth, being <HI>Munday, Hogenhoek</HI> sent the Secretary <HI>Cheko</HI> with a Letter to the Governour of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> who promis'd to speed it with his Post to the <HI>Nether|land</HI> Ships.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wednesday,</HI> being the twelfth, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> went all to the <HI>Pagode Con|zan,</HI> being one of the greatest in all those lower Territories, situate in a most pleasant and delightful Place, about three Leagues from <HI>Hoksieu.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the seventeenth, in the Afternoon, <HI>Lepora,</HI> one of the Vice-Roys Se|cretaries, came to visit <HI>Hogenhoek,</HI> to whom, amongst other Discourses, he re|lated, That the Enemies of <HI>Tanzwa</HI> and <HI>Lamao</HI> had alter'd their Opinions, ex|cept <HI>Ziekautia</HI> Chief General of <HI>Kimsia,</HI> who staid with his Wives, Children, Soldiers, and Jonks, to know on what Terms he should come in, having first cut off his Hair after the <HI>Tartar</HI> Fashion.</P>
<P>He also related, That there was shortly expected a Seal'd Letter from his Majesty, with great Presents for the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty eighth, being <HI>Tuesday, Hogenhoek</HI> went to visit the <HI>Conbon</HI> and Go|vernor, and desir'd him to expound the meaning of those Words, <HI>That the</HI> Hollanders <HI>might come and Trade with their Ships every other Year:</HI> To which he courteously reply'd, That the Great Council of State at <HI>Peking</HI> would not yet permit the <HI>Hollanders</HI> a Free Trade for ever, nor grant them a Place for the
<PB N="180" REF="106">
building of a Store-house, according to their Minds declared to his Majesty; but he was assur'd that his Imperial Majesty, on the Proposal of the Council, had made answer, <HI>That they might come once in two Years;</HI> which was as much as to say, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> coming from remote Places, could come but once in two Years with their Ships to Trade, at which time they should have leave to drive their Commerce: And it seem'd by this Order, that Gifts and Pre|sents were onely wanting to supple the Courtiers, and soften the Counsellors of State, through whose Hands all things of this nature pass'd, by reason of his Majesties Puerility: And if (continu'd he) you do hereafter order your Af|fairs accordingly, I dare promise and undertake that you may not onely come once a Year, and Traffick; but twice, if you be able so to do. Whereupon, after several such like Discourses, he took his leave and departed.</P>
<P>From the nineteenth, being <HI>Wednesday,</HI> till the twenty second, nothing hap|ned of any Remark, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> being onely busie in building of one small, and two great Rooms, for the stowing their Commodities against the next Season.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> the twenty third, the General <HI>Lipovi</HI>'s Chief Secretary came to to visit the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> with whom they discours'd about the News sent from the Court in <HI>Peking;</HI> and he explain'd it just as the Governor had done, say|ing, That he had discours'd with his Master about it, who had told him, The <HI>Hollanders</HI> are sure enough in this Countrey: The building of a Store-house is of small consequence; they have already a good House to Trade in. When his Majesty says, <HI>Once in two Years,</HI> they may come every Year, nay twice a Year, if they can, provided the <HI>Hobou</HI> (meaning <HI>Constantine Nobel</HI>) went back to <HI>Ba|tavia,</HI> and from thence were sent with a formal Embassy and Presents to the Court at <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>Against the Evening the Governor of <HI>Hoksieu</HI> sent the foremention'd Letter to <HI>Constantine Nobel</HI> back again, with information that the four Ships were gone.</P>
<P>On <HI>Munday</HI> the twenty fourth the Emperors Commissioners came from <HI>Pe|king,</HI> to confer Titles of Honor on <HI>Tonganpek</HI> and <HI>Zibja,</HI> the Sons of <HI>Zovja,</HI> whom his Majesty had receiv'd into Favor.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tuesday,</HI> being the twenty fifth, <HI>Ongsamya,</HI> Secretary to the Vice-Roy<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rse with</NOTE> <HI>Singlamong,</HI> receiv'd the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> that came to visit him very courteously; and after having drank two or three Cups of <HI>Tee,</HI> and shewed them his whole House, he solemnly invited them to a Dinner, where they were nobly enter|tain'd: And having pass'd about several Cups of their Liquor, he said to them, The <HI>Netherlanders</HI> may now be assur'd of a Free Trade for ever; but that they being so eminent Merchants, ought not to deal with the meaner sort of People, (as they had done the two preceding Years) who sold their Goods again by Retail, and then could scarce dispose of half of them; but that they should Trade with the Vice-Roy, General, and Governor, who if they wanted any thing in their Requests, might intercede for them at Court; and that then also they would be assur'd to carry out as much white Raw Silk (which his Majesty had prohibited on pain of death) as they desir'd: Whereas on the contrary, if their Highnesses were not pleas'd, they could not transport one Bale; therefore they ought to be wary.</P>
<P>Hereupon <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> made answer, That it was certain these Proposals might be advantageous, and that they agreed with the Opinions of his Ma|sters; but if the <HI>Hollanders</HI> should Trade with their Excellencies onely, who ingross'd the Commodity, as they had done in <HI>Canton,</HI> that then they could
<PB N="181" REF="106">
not subsist at that rate; on which account, and for no other Reason, they had left <HI>Canton:</HI> And he would rather prosecute the Design no farther, but go to a Place of Trade, where they might dispose of their Goods at Profit: But if their Highnesses would deal with them, they should have the Refusal, and they would be very reasonable, according as the Market went.</P>
<P>After this they fell into other Discourses, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Ziekautya,</HI> a famous Sol|dier, and General to <HI>Sepoan,</HI> was come to them, accompanied with six thousand of the chiefest <HI>Coxingan</HI> Soldiers; and that one of the chief Officers, <HI>Haytan's</HI> Brother, being ashore, and repenting, intended to make his Escape again in the Jonks that lay hard by, but was overtaken by some of the Vice-Roy's Sol|diers, who would immediately have Beheaded him, had not his Brother, who had been Governor of <HI>Haytan,</HI> begg'd him; yet nevertheless he was put into Prison. This Discourse being ended, and having drank a chirping Cup, he desir'd <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> to bear him Company for two or three Hours longer, and then gave him leave to return.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wednesday</HI> the twenty sixth, the Governor of <HI>Hoksieu</HI>'s Secretary came to visit the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> with Request, amongst other Discourses, for his Lords Cotton Quilt, promis'd by <HI>Constantine Nobel,</HI> which <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> immediately sent him.</P>
<P>The twenty eighth, being <HI>Friday, Hogenhoek</HI> went to the <HI>Conbon</HI> or Governor, with Requests to him, That since the Goods which he had left were not sold, he would grant him a Pass; for he intended to send some Goods to the Terri|tory of <HI>Nangkin,</HI> or <HI>Chikiang,</HI> there to exchange them for wrought Silks; To which he made Answer, That he could not do it of his own accord; but that he would write to the General <HI>Lipovi,</HI> who was also concern'd in it, and let him know his Answer in a Fortnights time.</P>
<P>Besides, the Governor told him, that it was their own faults, that they had not sold their Merchandizes sooner, for he was a Man of sixty Years old, in all which time he never knew Cloves sold for an hundred and sixty, or an hundred and seventy Tail; and accordingly all their other Goods were set at too high Rates, so that they would not go off, unless they sold them cheaper, although there was neither want of Buyers nor Money. The <HI>Chineses</HI> sold the Goods which they brought with them much cheaper, <HI>viz.</HI> Bags of Pepper at nine or ten; <HI>Sandal-Wood,</HI> twenty two; and Quicksilver, at an hundred and ten, and an hundred and twenty Tail; Colour'd Clothes, at three, and three and a half the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ell; Scarlet, five and six Tail; which said he, are too great gains, according to what they are bought at <HI>Kalappa. Hogenhock</HI> answer'd the Governor hereupon, That it seem'd not strange to him, that the Revolted <HI>Chi|neses</HI> sold their Goods so cheap, (for stoln Goods were always sold cheaper than those that were bought with ready Money;) at which the Governor Smiling, desir'd the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to excuse him, that he did not invite them to Dinner, because his youngest Wife lay a Dying, so that after having drank a Cup of Bean-Broth, they departed.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tuesday,</HI> being the first of <HI>April,</HI> the Governors Wife died, which occasi|on'd that he gave Audience to none in fourteen days time.</P>
<P><HI>Wednesday,</HI> being the second, the Vice-Roy's Secretary sent the Factor <HI>Lapora</HI> with a Letter to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> informing, That two Agents, with two <HI>Manda|rins</HI> stil'd <HI>Tzouzou</HI> (that is, <HI>Governors</HI>) came the twenty eighth of the first Moon from <HI>Peking,</HI> and had brought with them the Emperors Letter and Presents to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> for their faithful Service.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="107">On <HI>Tuesday</HI> the twenty eighth, <HI>Haytankon</HI> Governor of <HI>Sinkzieu,</HI> with two Jonks, set Sail to the <HI>Manillaes:</HI> Their Lading consisted chiefly in Raw and Wrought Silks: And it was rumor'd, That the Vice-Roy and General in|tended to send a Trading Fleet to <HI>Iapan,</HI> to which purpose abundance of Silk was already bought out of the upper Territories, which occasion'd so small Inquiry for the <HI>Netherland</HI> Goods.</P>
<P>About this time it hapned that no Rain had fallen for six or seven days: Whereupon the <HI>Conbon</HI> or Governor caus'd the killing or eating of Swine to be forbidden by Proclamation, on pain of death; because the young Rice-plants, that should be transplanted, dried up to nothing. And on the <HI>Thursday,</HI> being the seventeenth, the <HI>Conbon,</HI> with all his <HI>Mandarins</HI> and Nobles, went in Proces|sion on foot, (which was never seen before) into several Temples, and carried Perfumes, making great Offerings to their Idols. The Priests also went up and down every day making great Lamentations and Prayers for Rain; the more, because the <HI>Conbon</HI> had threatned them, That if no Rain fell in ten or twelve days, they should be severely beaten with Sticks.</P>
<P>The sixteenth, being <HI>Wednesday,</HI> the Factor <HI>Lapora</HI> came with a Letter, co|pied out of the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamongs,</HI> written to his Secretary <HI>Ongsamya,</HI> the Contents of which were as followeth.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe <HI>Holland</HI> Admiral hath by assisting Us against the Enemy gain'd great Honor, which I have made known to the Emperor, who hath sent two Agents from <HI>Peking,</HI> with an Imperial Letter and Presents to them: His Majesty hath also written to Us to go with your Forces and ingage <HI>Tayowan,</HI> and upon the Conquering of it, to restore it to you; and also that you may come every two Years to Trade. Acquaint the <HI>Holland Hobou</HI> with this joyful News, and that the Agents are also to be in <HI>Hoksieu</HI> within fifteen or six|teen Days.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>On <HI>Friday,</HI> the eighteenth, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were inform'd, That the Vice-Roy and General, attended with some of the Revolted <HI>Mandarins,</HI> were gone a Voyage with their Jonks to <HI>Tanswa</HI> and <HI>Lamoa,</HI> to meet <HI>Tziekautzia,</HI> who waited there to submit, as they had been inform'd; but coming thither, they found no body, <HI>Kimsia</HI> being fled with all his People; yet the <HI>Tartars</HI> not daring to stay, fearing his Return, took away the Villagers, with their Wives and Chil|dren, ruining and burning all they could find.</P>
<P>On <HI>Saturday,</HI> being the nineteenth, some Merchants came with Tydings that <HI>Tziekautzia</HI> had brought a great many Merchandises with him from <HI>Tayo|wan,</HI> and the other Islands, as Pepper, Sandal-Wood, Quicksilver, <HI>Iapan</HI>-Wood, Cloves, Amber, Cloth, and the like.</P>
<P>About this time the Rice (by reason of the abundance of Prisoners and <HI>Coxingan Chineses,</HI> and likewise the Army which lay there) began to grow very dear; insomuch that a Sack was sold for thirty five or thirty six <HI>Maes:</HI> Their Highnesses therefore were necessitated for some time to give leave to those <HI>Chineses</HI> that were not Soldiers, to go to Sea with their Vessels, and seek to get a Livelihood, and also Till some Ground on the Sea-shore.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday,</HI> the one and twentieth, News came that <HI>Houtin,</HI> one of the vali|antest Soldiers belonging to <HI>Sepoan,</HI> was come to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> accompanied with eight thousand Men, whom he deliver'd all to the <HI>Tartars;</HI> and likewise, That <HI>Kimsia</HI> was gone to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> and <HI>Anpikya</HI> to the <HI>Piscadores;</HI> and that <HI>Kim|sia</HI> resolv'd there to venture the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and the <HI>Tartars</HI> till the uttermost time, and was daily busie about fortifying and strengthning the Castle <HI>Ze|landia,</HI>
<PB N="183" REF="107">
and raising another Fort on <HI>Sakkam,</HI> so to make <HI>Formosa</HI> invincible.</P>
<P>On <HI>Thursday,</HI> being the twenty fourth, News came that the General <HI>Lipovi</HI> was gone from <HI>Sinchieuw</HI> to <HI>Soanchieuw,</HI> whence he was expected in ten or twelve days; likewise that a Post was come from the Court at <HI>Peking,</HI> with informa|tion, That <HI>Lipovi</HI> was made <HI>Povi,</HI> or Governor of three Provinces, <HI>viz. Fokien, Kiangsi,</HI> and <HI>Chekiang;</HI> a thing seldom done, to give the Chief Command, both in Civil and Military Affairs, of three Territories, to one Lord.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> the twenty eighth, a <HI>Mandarin</HI> came in the Governors Name to com|plement <HI>Hogenhoek,</HI> and to tell him, That the Emperors Agents were expected within five or six days in <HI>Hoksieu.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Tuesday</HI> the twenty ninth, the Governor caus'd an Idol-Priest, because he had been negligent in his Prayers and Offerings for Rain (for the droughty Season still continu'd) to be miserably beaten with Sticks, threatning him moreover, That if none fell in five or six days after, he should be executed.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>May,</HI> being <HI>Thursday,</HI> it hapned to rain, to the great joy of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">May.</NOTE> Idol-Priests; and the same day the Governor sent the <HI>Mandarin Tan-lavja</HI> to tell the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> That the Agents were expected either that day or the next, and if they would not please to go and fetch in those Lords, because they were come so great a Journey about their Business, it being the <HI>Tartars</HI> fashion, and that which <HI>Nobel</HI> had also done the last Year. Hereupon, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> prepar'd immediately to go to meet the Agents, and Congratulate their Wel|come, as soon as they should have notice of their Arrival.</P>
<P>On <HI>Saturday,</HI> being the third, in the Evening the long expected Commissio|ners came to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> with a great Train of <HI>Tartar</HI> Soldiers and Servants; so that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> could not fetch them in.</P>
<P>On the fourth in the Morning, <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> went with all his Attendants to the Castle, to Welcome the Emperors Agents, who came to meet him in the Hall, and conducted him thorow two or three Chambers, where several Stools were plac'd, desiring him to sit down on the left hand, (by them ac|counted the most Honorable, which <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> refus'd; yet after many Cere|monies, he was forc'd to sit right against the Chief Agent, who would not take the Upper-hand, saying, <HI>The</HI> Hollanders <HI>are Mighty Lords;</HI> and that His Majesty rejoyc'd very much that they had assisted him with such a great Fleet and For|ces, which was taken as a great kindness at Court, for to none else but the <HI>Hollanders</HI> did his Majesty ascribe that Victory: Wherefore he was sent from the Emperor to them, with returns of Thanks, together with Seal'd Letters and Presents. Then he signifi'd, that his Majesty had granted Licence to come thi|ther, and Traffique every other year; and besides, had written to their Excel|lencies the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong,</HI> the General <HI>Lipovi,</HI> and Governor of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> to joyn with the <HI>Netherland</HI> Fleet and Forces, and go with them to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> which after the Conquest, should be deliver'd to them, that they might as Neigh|boring Friends, Trade with one another.</P>
<P>Then the Agents ask'd for the Admiral <HI>Bort,</HI> and the Fleet: Whereupon <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> reply'd, That for divers Reasons written to their Highnesses, he was gone to <HI>Batavia,</HI> but intended to return very shortly with fresh Recruits, and then with joynt Forces to set upon <HI>Tayowan.</HI> Whereto the Agents reply'd, That his Majesty and the Council of State knew not, but that the Admiral and the whole Fleet had been still upon the Coast; for which reason, they had with all speed written to their Excellencies, to go with them to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> might be repossess'd of it, which his Majesty earnestly desir'd.
<PB N="184" REF="108">
They would willingly deliver him his Majesties Letter now, but their High|nesses, the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong,</HI> and General <HI>Lipovi,</HI> who were also concern'd in it, being absent, it could not be done: therefore they desir'd he would be pleas'd to have patience till their coming, which would be very shortly.</P>
<P><HI>Hogenhoek</HI> having drank a Cup or two of <HI>Tee,</HI> took his leave, and was con|ducted out at the Gates by the Agents, who profess'd great love to the <HI>Hollan|ders.</HI> In his return home, <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> met with the <HI>Conbon</HI> or Governor of <HI>Hok|sieu,</HI> accompany'd with divers Noblemen and <HI>Mandarins,</HI> who were all going to welcome and Complement the Agents.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> Morning, being the fifth, one <HI>Mandarin</HI> came in the Agents name to salute <HI>Hogenhoek;</HI> and after having been entertain'd with Wine and Fruit, took his leave.</P>
<P>Soon after, <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> went to the Governor to ask, If the opening of his Majesties Letter must be defer'd till the Vice-Roys and Generals coming home? Who answer'd, That it was very requisite; and because the Letter must be broke open in the presence of the foremention'd Persons, and him, he had al|ready sent an Express about it to their Excellencies: But that it would be eigh|teen or twenty days before the Vice-Roy could return, till which time he must have Patience. Then <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> ask'd the Governor, if it was requisite to invite the Agents to a Treat, and some other Recreation? Whereupon he was an|swer'd, That before they had done all their Commands and Businesses, they durst not come, but when that was done, he might do his pleasure. Asking moreover, If <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> did yet doubt, whether he was a true friend to the <HI>Hol|landers?</HI> And told him, That they were too hasty in the going with their Ships, and had they staid but five or six days longer, they might (without doubt) have carry'd this News to the King of <HI>Iacatra,</HI> (meaning <HI>Maetzuiker.</HI>) But the Admi|ral, for two years together, was gone so hastily, that he did not so much as take his leave of any person, which was not well taken by them, and they had written their discontent concerning it to the General and Governor of <HI>India:</HI> Which <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> answering, said, That necessity had forc'd them.</P>
<P>After being handsomly entertain'd, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> taking their leave, re|turn'd to their Quarters.</P>
<P>The sixth being <HI>Tuesday,</HI> some <HI>Chinese</HI> Merchants came to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Store|house to look upon the Commodities that were left; and afterwards ask'd, if the <HI>Hollanders</HI> would dispose of them by Parcels, or all together? To which <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> reply'd, That if they lik'd the whole quantity, that he would dispose of them all, and be paid for them as in <HI>Constantine Nobel</HI>'s time; at which the Merchants laughing, said, That then the Goods were sold the dearer, because it was the first time that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> drove a Trade there; and also, because the <HI>Chineses</HI> were formerly forbidden on pain of Death not to buy such Commo|dities of Foraigners: But if they would abate something of their Price, consi|dering the whole Parcel, then they would Treat with them; which if they would not do, they told <HI>Hogenhoek,</HI> that he might keep them a year or two lon|ger. Whereupon <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> desir'd them to make a proffer, which was, an hun|dred and forty Tail for the Cloves; an hundred and twenty for Quicksilver; for Amber of twelve Guilders, eight Tail; for that of eleven, seven Tail and an half; for that of six, four Tail; for that of five, three Tail; for that of twenty four <HI>Stivers,</HI> nine <HI>Maes;</HI> for the best sort of Camphier, of twenty three <HI>Ryals,</HI> eighteen Tail; for the second sort of twenty <HI>Ryals,</HI> sixteen Tail and a half; for Scarlet, six Tail the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ell; for Crimson, four Tail; for other Co|lours,
<PB N="185" REF="108">
three Tail; and if he thought fit to dispose of them at these Rates, they would deliver him White-Raw-Silk in the sixth Moneth at the Market Price which should be then; to which, <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> desiring some time of considerati|on, they return'd.</P>
<P>On <HI>Thursday,</HI> being the eighth, the General <HI>Lipovi</HI> return'd with all his Train to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> where he was nobly receiv'd by the <HI>Conbon</HI> or Governor.</P>
<P><HI>Friday,</HI> the ninth, <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> sent the Factor <HI>Pedel</HI> to the General <HI>Lipovi,</HI> to Complement and welcome him in his Name, because the Chollick, wherewith he was sore afflicted, prevented him from doing it in Person.</P>
<P>Being come home, he related, That the General had accepted of the excuse, and ask'd, if he had sold all his Goods; to which <HI>Pedel</HI> had made answer, <HI>No,</HI> and that they remain'd without any enquiry for them; which the Governor said, was not strange to him, because they held them at so high a rate; and if they intended to dispose of them before more came, they must set a more mo|derate Price, as they had done before, or else they would hereafter so stick on their Hands, that they would get nothing near so much for them as they might do now.</P>
<P>The tenth, being <HI>Saturday,</HI> the General sent for a piece of Crown Serge to <HI>Hogenhoek,</HI> which being carry'd him, he ask'd, What he must pay for it? <HI>Hogen|hoek</HI> answering, said, Forty Tail; to which the Factor reply'd, If the Mer|chants pay forty, my Master ought to pay but thirty eight, because he wants it for his own use, to make a Tent of it; whereupon <HI>Hogenhoek,</HI> according to his desire, let him have it.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> towards the Evening, the Governor sent his Servant to invite <HI>Ho|genhoek</HI> to come to Dine with him the next day; to which returning Thanks, he sent word, that he would come, notwithstanding he was not well.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> Morning, the twelfth, <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> went to the General <HI>Lipovi</HI>'s House, to Complement and welcome him; because at his coming he could not in Person do it, being prevented by Sickness, and now going to a Treat at the Governors, it might have been ill resented, if he had not first visited the General.</P>
<P>When coming, he had immediately Audience by the General, who before he sate down, ask'd him concerning his Health, and why he walk'd abroad so soon, and that he could see by his looks that he was not perfectly cur'd. To which he answer'd, That he did it for the Reasons aforesaid, fearing if he had deny'd, that the Governor might perhaps have resented it ill.</P>
<P>The General, after he had drank, and Presented <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> with a Cup of Milk mixt with Bean Flower and <HI>Peking</HI> Butter, he began to speak concerning the Letter that came from the Emperor, whereby he said, It appear'd how the Emperor lov'd the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> observing, he had Commanded his Forces to go to assist them out of his own Dominions, which was never done before, neither in the <HI>Chinese</HI> nor <HI>Tartar</HI> Government. Nay, that which is more, if the <HI>Hollanders</HI> desir'd <HI>Tayowan,</HI> they should possess it again, and then as true and faithful Friends, to Trade and assist one another; as for their Trading there, they were ascertain'd; and concerning their coming every other year, they need not to take any notice thereof, but that they might upon his word come and Traffique every Year.</P>
<P>But an Ambassador must without fail be sent to the Emperor, with humble Thanks and Presents for his gracious Favors; and that he had writ to his Ma|jesty, that the old <HI>Hobou</HI> (meaning <HI>Constantine Nobel</HI>) was gone to <HI>Batavia,</HI> to
<PB N="186" REF="109">
be Commission'd to that purpose; and therefore it would not be convenient, that any other should come in his stead. But <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> answering, that he could not assure it; the General seem'd dissatisfi'd, however taking no further no|tice, ask'd, When the Admiral <HI>Bort</HI> would come again, because they only wait|ed for the Fleet to go to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> to ingage it with all their Forces: To which <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> reply'd, that he knew not certainly the time, but suppos'd, that the Fleet would either be there again in <HI>Iune,</HI> or the beginning of <HI>August,</HI> as the Admiral <HI>Bort</HI> had written at his departure to their Highnesses. But the Gene|ral in return, onely declar'd himself unsatisfi'd with the <HI>Holland</HI> Admirals de|parture, laying the whole fault of the Enemies not being totally subdu'd up|on him, who (he said) pretended to be more bound up, and limited by his Commission than he was.</P>
<P><HI>Hogenhoek,</HI> after many other Discourses, desir'd, That he might take his leave, which the General permitted, because he was invited by the <HI>Conbon</HI> or Gover|nor; from whence as he was going, he met with a <HI>Mandarin</HI> by the way, sent by the <HI>Conbon,</HI> to tell him, That it was time to come, because the Agents were there already.</P>
<P>Coming to the Court, <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> was very courteously receiv'd by the Go|vernor, and likewise by the Agents, which being pass'd, they took their places: The Governor sat below the foremention'd Lords. The Stools on which they sate were cover'd with Damask, Imbroyder'd with Gold. After having rested themselves a little, the Agents crav'd <HI>Hogenhoek</HI>'s excuse, that they had not vi|sited him, alledging, That the chief reason was, because they had not fully effected all their Commands; which should no sooner be done, but they would wait upon him in his House.</P>
<P>Then having drunk a Cup or two of Milk, the Governor desir'd the <HI>Ne|therlanders</HI> to rise, and sit down at the Table, as the Stools were plac'd, on which they accordingly went, and seated themselves.</P>
<P>Whilst they were at Dinner, the Governor had order'd some other Pastimes to be presented, so to make the Treat the nobler, which was very Magnificent of it self: After the several Chargers with variety of Meat, had been chang'd for greater Delicacies thirty six several times, and the Feast ended with Mirth and Entertainment, the Agents took their leave first, and afterwards the <HI>Ne|therlanders.</HI></P>
<P>On the twenty ninth, against the Evening, the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> return'd to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> where he was receiv'd with great signs of Rejoycing, having Con|quer'd <HI>Tamzwa, Lamoa,</HI> and other little Isles lying thereabouts, by which the whole Coast was clear'd.</P>
<P>The twentieth, the <HI>Mandarins</HI> belonging to the Agents came again to the <HI>Ne|therlanders,</HI> to raise the Price of Silks, telling their Landlord, that they had understood by the way, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> bought great quantities of Silk, which they sent to <HI>Batavia,</HI> a thing contrary to the Emperors Order. But be|cause of their Services done to the Empire, it was conniv'd at; therefore their Masters had also bought Silk to deliver to them, which if they would not take, it might easily be wrought by the Agents means, to procure the Vice-Roy, Ge|neral <HI>Lipovi,</HI> and Governor, to forbid them to buy any more, before they had leave from the Emperor, with several other such like Discourses; but <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> returning them the former answer, they went away unsatisfi'd.</P>
<P>About ten a Clock, <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> with all his Company, went to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s Court, to Complement and wish him joy, of the Conquest gotten against his Enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="109">Coming thither, the Vice-Roy was gone about half an hour before, to visit one of his Chief Captains, that lay very sick. But his Interpreter desir'd the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> to stay a little in the base Court, and he would give his Highness notice; which being accordingly done, the Vice-Roy, after a little stay, re|turn'd home, and immediately granted Audience to <HI>Hogenhoek,</HI> who Congra|tulated his happy Return, and likewise his Victory, for which his Highness return'd him Thanks, and wish'd him Joy of the Letter and Presents sent to them from his Majesty. But after some short and Complemental Discourses, the Vice-Roy made fresh Complaints of the Admiral <HI>Borts</HI> sudden departure, without giving him the least notice of it, saying, it was true, that he had re|ceiv'd a Letter from him, but it was just at his departure, when he had no time to answer it.</P>
<P>He ask'd moreover, if the Admiral would return, or another come in his place; to which <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> made answer, That it was at the King of <HI>Iacatra</HI>'s pleasure, and that he could not give his Excellency any assurance of it.</P>
<P>Then the Vice-Roy said, That in regard he could not agree with the Admiral therefore wish'd, that there would come another in his stead; for had the Admi|ral (said he) observ'd my Advice, to have gone together to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> after we had Conquer'd <HI>Tamzwa</HI> and <HI>Lamoa,</HI> we had surely been Masters of it er'e this time. But the Admiral would never believe him; but there was now Order come from his Majesty to go thither; for He did not know, but that the Fleet was there yet, and therefore for their faithful Service done to the Realm, he had likewise granted them to come and Trade every Year, which they ought to take as a great Favor, and believe, that his Majesty was very graciously in|clin'd towards them, and therefore when an Ambassador should come with Addresses to his Majesty, he doubted not, but what er'e else they desir'd at Court, they would obtain. They staid only for the Fleet, which should no sooner be come, but according to his Majesties Commands, they would go to|gether to <HI>Tayowan.</HI> At last excusing himself, that he could not in person stay to Treat him, being still weary of his Journey, he Commanded two of his Coun|cil to bear <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> Company, and Entertain him, and when it was time to open the Emperors Letter, they should give him notice; which said, he went in, and the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> soon after return'd to their Lodgings.</P>
<P>Against the Evening, being the one and twentieth, their Excellencies sent word to <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> by one of their <HI>Mandarins,</HI> that the next Morning about Sun rising, he should go to the Emperors <HI>Poetzienzie;</HI> and accordingly at the ap|pointed time, <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> taking Horse, went thither with all speed; where coming, and finding the whole Court Guarded, he stay'd at an appointed place, till the Vice-Roy and Agents came with the Emperors Letter; where, also, the General <HI>Lipovi,</HI> with the <HI>Conbon</HI> or Governor, and all the <HI>Mandarins</HI> waited.</P>
<P>After they had staid some time, the General <HI>Lipovi</HI> sent to the Factor <HI>Pedel,</HI> to tell <HI>Hogenhoek,</HI> That since he could not help to fetch in the Emperors Letter at first; that now, when it came to the Court, he should fall on one of his Knees, to do it Reverence, because it was the Custom of the Country; <HI>Nobel</HI> ha|ving also done it at the fetching in of the Letter the last Year.</P>
<P><HI>Hogenhoek</HI> having staid an hour with patience, the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> ap|pear'd with a great Train of his <HI>Mandarins,</HI> Nobles, and Courtiers, and soon af|ter, the Agents with the Emperors Letters and Presents.</P>
<P>The Letter was carry'd by eight Persons, all in a Livery of Red and Yel|low,
<PB N="188" REF="110">

</FIGURE>
on two Wax'd Sticks, on which stood a Cabinet made like a Temple, richly Gilt and adorn'd with Imagery; in this Cabinet lay the Emperors Let|ter, wrap'd up in a Yellow Scarf: Afterwards follow'd five or six Red Wax'd Tables, cover'd with Damask Clothes, and carry'd by four Persons, on which the Presents which consisted in Money, Gold, and Silks lay bare: Then fol|low'd the Agents on Horse-back, accompany'd with divers Nobles.</P>
<P>Before the Emperors Letter walk'd above twenty Persons, beating on Drums, and playing on divers Musical Instruments; so that it rather seem'd to be a great Triumph, than for the reading of a Letter.</P>
<P>As it pass'd by, <HI>Hogenhoek,</HI> according to the Generals Request, shew'd Reve|rence to the Letter, by Bowing of his Head and Body; which done, they fol|low'd the Train into a great Hall, where their Excellencies were already Seat|ed, and then rose up: After they had consulted a little together, <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> was again Commanded to Kneel, and so to continue Kneeling all the time, whilst it was reading.</P>
<P>After the Letter had been read publickly, it was laid on <HI>Hogenhoek's</HI> Arm by the Chief Agent; for which Honor, he was forc'd Kneeling to bow his Head several times together, and likewise for the thousand Tail, and Silk Stuffs.</P>
<P>After this, their Excellencies went to sit under a Canopy, and caus'd a great Tankard with Milk mixt with <HI>Peking</HI> Butter and Bean Flower, to be brought to them, whereupon they invited <HI>Hogenhock</HI> also to sit down by them; at last, the Vice-Roy rising and taking his leave, went to his own Court: Soon af|ter follow'd the General <HI>Lipovi,</HI> and lastly, the two Agents, <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> and Governors, who advis'd <HI>Hogenhoek,</HI> that he should go the next day to Thank the Agents, which he accordingly promis'd to do.</P>
<P>The Emperors Letter <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> Commanded <HI>Lewis de Keizer</HI> to carry on his back, but the Presents were laid in <HI>Pallakins;</HI> all the way which they pass'd, several sorts of People, with Drums and other Musical Instruments, throng'd the Streets to see them.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="110"><HI>Hogenhoek</HI> coming home, was welcom'd by two of the Emperors <HI>Poetzienzie,</HI> with three Volleys of Shot, and the Drums and Pipes play'd a whole hour be|fore the Letter, which they did onely to get Money; for <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> was direct|ed to give somewhat more than <HI>Nobel</HI> had done the Year before; and likewise the Vice-Roy and General Order'd <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> to go the next day to visit the Agents, and return them Thanks, because it seldom or never happen'd, that his Majesty gave such great Presents to any Person whatsoever.</P>
<P>After <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> had been at home some time, he caus'd the Emperors Letter to be Translated: Which was to this effect.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>I <HI>Conghy</HI> Emperor, send this Letter to the <HI>Holland</HI> Admiral <HI>Balthazar.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Love strangers who come from remote and far distant places, as an Emperor ought to do; and the more, because those that do us good, must receive good again; and those that deserve Honor, must be well rewarded. I have certainly understood that you have purchas'd Honor, therefore I have sent Pre|sents to you. I have heard, that you <HI>Balthazar</HI> have justly and valiantly gone with my Officers to War, by which I perceive you mean honestly with me and my People, as appears by your subduing the Pyrats, and driving them away, like a Bird which hath made a Nest to Hatch in, and is now broken to pieces. The Honor which I always expected from the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> by Conquer|ing the <HI>Islanders,</HI> and driving them away from thence, is perform'd; therefore I am Oblig'd to Gratifie you with some Gifts, and send this my Letter, desiring you to accept my Presents, and Honor my Letter.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Conghy.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The Presents that came with his Majesties Letter, consisted in a thousand Tail of <HI>Chinese</HI> Silver, and sixty Pieces of several Silks and Cloth of Tissue.</P>
<P>On <HI>Friday,</HI> the twenty third, <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> went in the Morning with all his At|tendance to the Vice-Roy and General, and likewise to the Emperors Commis|sioners, to acquaint them, that he was dissatisfi'd for that the Emperors Let|ter made no mention of their Traffick, or about their staying there, much less, to go with their Fleet and Forces to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> as their Highnesses had long since promis'd him, as also the Admiral <HI>Bort,</HI> and Captain <HI>Nobel; viz.</HI> that there were Seal'd Letters expected from his Majesty about it; and likewise, that the Admiral and they had not without reason complain'd of their inconstancy, appear'd now plainly, because not one of their Verbal Promises and Assurances were found to be true, which would be very ill resented by the Lord General, that they had been detain'd two years, and now receiv'd nothing but words: To which the Vice-Roy answer'd with a Grim Countenance, that' tis true, his Majesty had permitted the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to Trade, but an Ambassador must every other year be sent to him; and as to the business of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> they would be ready to go with them thither to subdue it; if therefore an Ambassador should come, they would immediately dispatch him with Letters of Recommendation to <HI>Peking;</HI> Whereupon he durst assure them, that they would obtain the ever|lasting Trade, and leave to go and come when they pleas'd, and also have an Island or piece of Land alotted them, on which they might reside without Molestation.</P>
<P>The like Answers <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> receiv'd from the Governor; but the General <HI>Lipovi</HI> seem'd to be highly displeas'd, saying, That so great honor of receiving
<PB N="190" REF="111">
Presents, and a Seal'd Letter from the Emperor, in which he attributed the Honor of Conquering the Enemy to them, was never yet known; so that they ought to have been satisfi'd with that only. <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> reply'd, That they thank'd his Majesty for his Favor: But where-ever the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were per|mitted to Trade, they receiv'd Seal'd Letters from the Princes, which serv'd as a safe-guard for their Governors: Nay further, (said he) the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Trade thorow the whole World, without being limited a time; but when er'e they came, they were Welcome, and Traffiqu'd as they thought fit: Whereupon the General angerly reply'd, Each Countrey had its fashion, and so accordingly had his; if they did not like the proffer of coming every two years once, they might stay away; and if they did not come in the time li|mited, they should go away again without effecting any thing. <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> an|swer'd, That this Discourse seem'd very strange, when as he himself had pro|mis'd, that he would procure him Seal'd Letters from his Majesty for it, and indeed in Honor he could do no less, their Requests being so reasonable, <HI>viz.</HI> That after the Conquering of the Islands, they might for their great Charge and trouble, only enjoy the benefit of Trade.</P>
<P>The Vice-Roy having been silent some time, diverted the Discourse, ask|ing <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> if <HI>Nobel</HI> would return, with Addresses and Presents to his Maje|sty at <HI>Peking?</HI> Whereto he reply'd, That he could not assure it, in regard it was in the Lord General's choice, whom he would choose to Negotiate such an Affair.</P>
<P>Then the General told him, as he had often done before, That he had writ to the Emperor, and at <HI>Nobels</HI> return, they would grant the Company all what they would ask; for the Emperor affected the <HI>Hollanders</HI> very much, as appear'd by his Letters and Presents, which in his time had never been done to any Stranger; and the Agents must also be better gratifi'd than <HI>Nobel</HI> had done, and that without fail, the next day, because they were just upon their return to the Court.</P>
<P>Hereupon <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> ask'd the Vice-Roy, that he would be pleas'd to tell him, how much more he should give than <HI>Nobel</HI> had done? Who said, That it was at his pleasure: Then <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> taking his leave, went thence to the Agents, who courteously receiv'd him, and Discours'd with them concerning the constant Trade, saying, He hop'd that they would have brought Seal'd Let|ters from his Majesty about it. To which they reply'd, That they had deli|ver'd Seal'd Letters about it to their Excellencies, <HI>Singlamong, Lipovi,</HI> and the <HI>Conbon</HI> or Governor of <HI>Hoksieu;</HI> to this effect, that if an Ambassador came to thank his Majesty, he should immediately travel up into the Countrey, and the Trade take a beginning to come every other year.</P>
<P>The Agents also were of opinion, That if an Embassy was sent to the Court at <HI>Peking,</HI> that the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> if they requested any thing else, it would be granted them, in regard his Majesty bore a great affection towards them, (be|cause they had so faithfully assisted in the War) and gave them the sole Honor of the Conquest of <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy.</HI> They also promis'd <HI>Hogenhoek,</HI> that when they came to the Court, they would seek to obtain a Grant from his Ma|jesty for the constant Trade, for which he thanking them, return'd to his Lodging, where he debated the General's Proposal of augmenting the Pre|sents to be made to the Emperors Commissioners, and at last resolv'd to give the prime Agent twenty two <HI>Dutch</HI> Ells of Scarlet, half a Chain of Blood Coral weighing six Ounces, two Pieces of Colour'd Perpetuana's, six Pieces of Lin|nen, with four rich Swords.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="111">The second Agent they gave seventeen Ells of Scarlet, half a Chain of the like Coral, weighing four Ounces, two Pieces of Colour'd Perpetuana's, four Pieces of Linnen, and two Swords; and likewise in their Presence, their <HI>Man|darins</HI> and other Attendants were also presented every one according to their Quality.</P>
<P>On <HI>Saturday</HI> Morning, being the twenty fourth, <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> with his Servants went to the Agents to deliver the Presents, who seem'd to refuse them, yet after having look'd them over, and deny'd them several times, they at last over&punc;perswaded by <HI>Hogenhoek,</HI> receiv'd them.</P>
<P>At parting, <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> desir'd once more, that they would be pleas'd to seek the <HI>Hollanders</HI> advantage, before the Emperor and Council of State, in the gaining of the constant Trade, and render such an account of them, as they had found and seen during their stay; all which they faithfully promis'd.</P>
<P>Besides, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had some discourse about Trading into several parts of <HI>India,</HI> and what Goods were brought thither, and carry'd from thence by the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> which they again Transported to other places.</P>
<P>The Agents seem'd to be much delighted in this Discourse, saying, If an Ambassador be sent to the Emperor, and the Enemy be driven from <HI>Tayo|wan,</HI> they need not fear but all things would be granted them. Here the Dis|course ended, and <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> returning Thanks, took his leave and departed.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday,</HI> being the twenty sixth, the Governor or <HI>Conbon</HI> sent the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> a Present, being good Table-provision; for which <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> return'd him thanks by Factor <HI>Pedell.</HI></P>
<P>On <HI>Thursday</HI> the twenty ninth, the <HI>Chineses</HI> kept the Feast in <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> by them<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feast <HI>Peelou</HI> kept by the <HI>Chineses.</HI></NOTE> call'd <HI>Peelou;</HI> and likewise on the same day through all <HI>China, viz.</HI> with long Boats with Oars, new Painted and trick'd with Silk Flags and Pennons of se|veral colours, with which they Challenge and Row great Matches.</P>
<P>According to the <HI>Chineses</HI> relation to <HI>Hogenhoek,</HI> the Instituter of this great Festival <HI>Peelou,</HI> was formerly Governor of the <HI>Paracelles,</HI> a Countrey that is very fruitful, and abounds with Gold and Silver, who foretold, That that Island should be swallow'd up: wherefore he and some of his Friends, and others that believ'd him, several days before fled from thence in their Jonks to the Main of <HI>China;</HI> where they honor him as a God of the Sea: for as they report, soon after his departure the Island sunk; in Commemoration of which they keep this annual Holy-day.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> to observe the Custom of this Feast, as also to recreate them|selves, hir'd a Boat to go among the rest.</P>
<P>No sooner was <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> return'd home, but the General <HI>Lipovi</HI> sent his <HI>Mandarin</HI> to give him notice, that the Emperors Agents intended the next Morn|ing to go for <HI>Peking,</HI> and that he and his Men should conduct them out of the City, and therefore to send him word what Horses he wanted, and they should be accordingly furnish'd.</P>
<P>On <HI>Friday,</HI> being the thirtieth, about Day-break, another <HI>Mandarin,</HI> sent from <HI>Lipovi,</HI> came to <HI>Hogenhoek,</HI> to desire him that he would be at the Agents House betimes: Whereupon he and his Men went immediately thither, some on Horses, others in <HI>Pallakins;</HI> where coming they found them busie Packing up their Goods, and linking and coupling of Slaves and Slavesses, to the num|ber of six or seven hundred, taken from the Islands <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> and gi|ven to them by the Governors of <HI>Zing</HI> and <HI>Sanzieuw,</HI> and other Officers; where|fore the <HI>Hollanders</HI> desir'd to go out before, that they might not hinder the
<PB N="192" REF="112">
Agents; which accordingly they did: and after having stay'd a considerable time at the Vice-Roys open House, the Agents came to them on Horseback&punc; excusing themselves that they had made them stay so long: which they an|swering again with a Complement, told them, That they had not accounted the time long, but took it for an honor to wait upon them.</P>
<P>Here the Emperors Envoys thank'd <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> for the Presents, saying, That they had receiv'd them very kindly, but knew not whether his Majesty would let them keep such great Gifts without ordering to return them again. They also promis'd, as they had done several times before, to speak in the behalf of the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> before his Majesty and Council, and give them an account of all they had seen and heard; and also would do their utmost endeavor, and assist the Ambassador when he should come to <HI>Peking:</HI> for which <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> re|turning them humble thanks, Drank to them his Majesties Health in a great Glass of Sack that he had ready for that purpose, which went merrily round. The Envoy much admiring the excellent rellish of the Liquor, ask'd if it grew in their native Countrey? saying, That it must need be a brave Place, which not onely produces such excellent Wine, but divers sorts of rare Commodities, desiring him to give each of their chiefest Servants also a Glass, that when they came to <HI>Peking,</HI> they might say they had drank some <HI>Dutch</HI> Liquor. This done, and the <HI>Hollanders</HI> having taken their Leave, they return'd, and came to|wards Evening to their Quarters.</P>
<P>The last, being <HI>Saturday, Hogenhoek</HI> was inform'd, that the General <HI>Lipovi</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lipovi</HI> will resign his Governorship.</NOTE> had shut up his great Gates, because he would not grant any more Audience; and also that he would not trouble himself any longer about business concern|ing his Office, being resolv'd to go to <HI>Peking,</HI> where his most pre-eminent Wife (Aunt to the present Emperor) resided, she having writ to him several times to come up to her.</P>
<P>The Council of State (as on the twenty fourth of <HI>April</HI> is related) endea|vor'd preferring the General, to make him chief Governor of three Territo|ries, which he modesty refused, being rather willing to give over all Offices of State, because (as he told <HI>Hogenhoek</HI>) his Age requir'd case, and that to Go|vern was a Work too great for him; and to that purpose expected his <HI>Writ of Ease,</HI> for which he had sent five or six Posts to his Majesty and the Council, whose Answer he expected daily.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tuesday,</HI> being the thirtieth of <HI>Iune, Hogenhoek</HI> sent Factor <HI>Pedell</HI> to the<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hogenhoeks</HI> Request for the Emperors Allowance.</NOTE> <HI>Conbon,</HI> or Governor, telling him, That he had not receiv'd any allowance of Money for his Table from the <HI>Mandarins</HI> in two Moneths, and therefore desir'd that he would please to provide it for him. The Governor, to whom this seem'd very strange, said, That his Majesty had not yet forbid, but that it should be continu'd. But however, on <HI>Thursday</HI> Morning early, he with all his Company went to the Vice-Roy and General themselves, complaining that they had not receiv'd their Table Pension these two Moneths: whereat they were much dissatisfi'd, and immediately sent Order to the two <HI>Mandarins,</HI> not to fail to pay the Arrears next day, and so at every Moneths end punctually, at their peril, and thence-forward.</P>
<P>On <HI>Friday,</HI> being the sixth, the Grand <HI>Mandarin Tziekautzia,</HI> came from <HI>Sin|chieu</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iune.</NOTE> by Land to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> with a Guard of between four and five hundred Sol|diers, and the remainder of them were to come within a day or two after, with his Jonks. It was also reported, that he should go to <HI>Iemping,</HI> a Town about nine days Journey from <HI>Hoksieu</HI>) to be Governor of it, though the Townsmen oppos'd it.</P>

<P>The <HI>Netherlanders</HI> heard this day the news of the death of <HI>Tonganpek, Zavja</HI>'s Brother, and one of the Admirals, as also of the great Court Messenger.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tuesday</HI> the twenty fourth, <HI>Zanzia,</HI> chief Secretary to <HI>Lipovi,</HI> came in his Masters Name to acquaint <HI>Hogenhoek,</HI> that he had sent to <HI>Tziekautzia</HI> concern|ing the Prisoners; who answer'd, That they which came to him from the Castle <HI>Zelandia</HI> in <HI>Formosa,</HI> had told him, that they would rather chuse to be chopp'd in Pieces, than return again to their Countrey-men; and that the <HI>Negro</HI> Boys refus'd in like manner. To which <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> made answer, That it seem'd very strange to him, since every day one or other spoke to him to pro|cure their Liberty. I hear, that since I mov'd the General concerning their Free|dom, they have been in Fetters, and harder restraint than before. In brief, I am confident he has falsly inform'd the General, of which I desire you will please to acquaint him.</P>
<P>The twenty fifth and twenty sixth <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> sent a Letter to the General <HI>Lipovi,</HI> but it was not receiv'd in regard of his Infirmity: but on <HI>Friday</HI> the twenty eighth it was deliver'd, and Answer sent, That he had read the Letter, and finding mention'd therein, That unless the Prisoners were deliver'd, some trouble would arise thereupon, which he understood to be Threats; therefore <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> must know that he was <HI>Lipovi,</HI> and that it lay in his power to do the <HI>Hollanders</HI> good or hurt, and desir'd to hear no more such calumnious words, or else to forbear the Court.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sunday</HI> following the Master of the Lodgings where the Agents lay, de|sir'd him to take <HI>Tziekautzia</HI>'s Goods and sell them for him, promising to give him a good Reward for so doing: The Cargo consisted in twenty four Pie|ces of colour'd Cloths, ten <HI>Picols</HI> of Amber, three hundred of Tin and Lead, thirty Birds-nests, fifty of Pepper, three hundred of <HI>Iapan</HI> Wood, twenty of Quicksilver, twenty five of Cloves, and one hundred <HI>Picols</HI> of <HI>Sandal</HI> Wood, besides other Commodities. But <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> refus'd it, alledging they had not yet put off their own Goods; wherefore he durst not undertake another Mans Business.</P>
<P>The same day <HI>Lepora</HI> the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s Secretary lying near, came to Visit the Agent, as his custom was, and discoursing with him concerning the Prisoners, and <HI>Lipovi</HI>'s rough Answer, proffer'd his Service to acquaint the Vice-Roy with the Business, well knowing that he had sent two or three days before to <HI>Lipovi</HI> to let <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> have them; to which he assented.

<P>The sixth the Governor or <HI>Conbon,</HI> went to the Castle <HI>Tiolo,</HI> lying about three Leagues from <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> to Besiege <HI>Ovatunge,</HI> an old Soldier, that held out against the <HI>Tartars</HI> from the time of <HI>Iquon, Coxinga</HI>'s Father, being now of the age of seventy years, and having under his Command three thousand Men.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tuesday</HI> the eighth, <HI>Tziekautsia</HI> went to <HI>Iemping,</HI> to take the Government upon him, having four or five hundred Soldiers and eighty Jonks, with which upon the return of the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet they were to go to <HI>Tayowan,</HI> as the Vice-Roy and General had inform'd <HI>Hogenhoek.</HI></P>
<P>From the tenth to the eighteenth nothing hapned of any remark: when the Merchants which came from <HI>Nanking</HI> out of the Territory <HI>Chekiang,</HI> carry'd all their Silks to <HI>Sinksieu,</HI> not coming to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> which was to the great preju|dice of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> as well in the Goods which they Imported, as those which they intended to Export.</P>
<P><HI>Haytankon,</HI> Governor of <HI>Sinksieu,</HI> and also others, might not publickly send any Jonks to <HI>Iapan,</HI> the <HI>Manilla's</HI> and <HI>Tayowan,</HI> but us'd this Invention, which <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> makes mention of in his Annotations, <HI>viz.</HI> those Jonks which they intended to send away, they load in publick at the Keys, and when ready to Lanch them, news comes in another, that some of the Enemies Jonks are on the Coast: whereupon the Merchant immediately unladeth, and the Cargo is car|ry'd ashore, and their Jonk with others sent to Fight the hovering Enemy, while privately in the Night they load again with prohibited Goods, which get away by Day-break; but this could not be done, but by the connivance of the Searchers, knowing the Grandees are concern'd in the Freight.</P>
<P>From the seventeenth, being <HI>Thursday,</HI> till the twenty sixth, nothing hap|ned but a prodigious Storm, mix'd with impetuous Showres of Rain, conti|nually deluging for nine days, by which many Houses were torn down and wash'd away, and twenty People drown'd in <HI>Hoksieu.</HI> It rag'd also in the neighboring Parts; for in the Streets of <HI>Lamthay</HI> the Water was Knee-deep: and in <HI>Sinksieu</HI> the Water swell'd so high, that they lost above four thou|sand People, which were overwhelm'd and carry'd away with the Torrent, and in some Places sweeping away whole Villages: In the Fort at <HI>Sinksieu</HI> the Land-flood did rise fourteen or fifteen Foot high. Amongst others the Vice-Roy lost four hundred <HI>Picols</HI> of white Raw Silk, which he thought to sell to <HI>Tonganpek,</HI> which made Silk to rise two hundred Tail; and as it was re|ported, there was above two thousand <HI>Picols</HI> more carry'd away and spoil'd.</P>
<P>On <HI>Tuesday,</HI> being the twenty ninth, <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> gave the General a Visit;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hogenhoek</HI> visits <HI>Lipovi.</HI></NOTE> who, though much indispos'd, rejoyc'd to see him, asking him why their Fleet stay'd away so long? to which <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> made answer, That they had a Moneth good to the time of their arrival the last year: at which the Gene|ral wondring said, You came in the sixth Moon: but he reply'd, It was be|cause there were two sixth Moons that year; but if the General pleas'd to rec|kon the days, he would find a great difference. The General seem'd to doubt whether any Ships would come thither that year, because they stay'd away so long, and ask'd if <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> would assure him of their coming? whereupon he reply'd, It was without doubt, and therefore desir'd the General to have patience; that their Ships wanted a great deal of Repair, which requir'd some
<PB N="195" REF="116">
Moneths before they could be fitted to go to Sea. We, said the General, are all ready so soon as we receive tydings, that the Admiral is arriv'd at the <HI>Pisca|dores,</HI> or before <HI>Tayowan,</HI> to send the great <HI>Mandarin, Tziekautsia</HI> Governor of <HI>Sinksieu,</HI> and <HI>Zietetok,</HI> and two other great Lords, to welcom and consult with him.</P>

<P>On <HI>Saturday,</HI> being the sixteenth, <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> had news, That one of <HI>Haytan|kon</HI>'s Jonks, the Governor of <HI>Sinksieu,</HI> in its return from the <HI>Manilla</HI>'s was taken by <HI>Anpikja</HI>'s Jonks, having a hundred and fifty thousand <HI>Spanish</HI> Ryals in her, and that <HI>Haytankon</HI> had on the contrary taken nine Jonks loaden with Rice, to carry to <HI>Zanchieu,</HI> in which Place Rice was very scarce. None was able to apprehend these kind of dealings, in the taking one anothers Jonks; yet never|theless Traded with one another, the one is Silks and Cotton Clothes, and the other in Rice.</P>
<P>Till the two and twentieth nothing hapned of remark.</P>
<P>The three and twentieth towards Evening, the Vice-Roy's Factor came to<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Hogenhoek</HI> invited by the Vice-Roy to Dinner.</NOTE> invite <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> in his Lords Name to Dine with him the next day, which he promis'd to do.</P>
<P>The twenty fourth, being <HI>Sunday, Hogenhoek</HI> went with all his Attendants to the Court; where coming they were immediately call'd into the Hall of Au|dience, fill'd with <HI>Mandarins</HI> and Lords, the Vice-Roy himself sitting very stately on a Stool, with a Chain about his Neck, and an <HI>Ave Mary</HI> fix'd to it, bad <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> kindly welcom. Having sat a little while, he related, That<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Discourse with him,</NOTE> about three Moneths since he had sent a Letter to the Council of State in be|half of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> to be deliver'd to his Majesty, but would not tell him of it before, because he knew not whether his Majesty or the Council would grant his Request, as he was now inform'd; therefore he had invited him to be merry: for which <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> humbly thank'd the Vice-Roy. Yesterday (said the Vice-Roy) there came some Agents with two <HI>Mandarins</HI> from his Majesty to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> onely to enquire if there were one or two <HI>Ongs,</HI> that is <HI>Kings,</HI> in <HI>Batavia:</HI> And they understood there were two from the Letters that came from <HI>Canton;</HI> for that of <HI>Canton</HI> was in the Name of the Governor, Gene|ral <HI>Maetzuiker</HI> of <HI>Batavia;</HI> and that of <HI>Hoksieu</HI> written to their Highnesses, was in the Names of Captain <HI>Moor</HI> and <HI>Iohn Maetzuiker.</HI> He added also, that he had a Letter from the <HI>Lepous,</HI> or Council of State at <HI>Peking;</HI> in which was menti|on'd, That his Majesty had granted his Request, which much rejoyced the Vice-Roy, who promis'd to send them the Copy of it: for which <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> return'd him humble thanks, answering, That the Lord General would think himself much oblig'd to hear of his great Favors. As to what concern'd the Names and Titles, <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> said they were all one, and that they had but one Governor-General, which was the Lord <HI>Iohn Maetzuiker,</HI> but by the <HI>Indians</HI> was Entituled <HI>Captain Moor,</HI> that is, <HI>Chief,</HI> or Governor over all others in <HI>India;</HI> so that both Titles were butone. Hereupon the Vice-Roy ask'd how many Councellors and petty Governors he had under him? to which <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> an|swer'd, Seventeen or eighteen: at which the Vice-Roy seem'd to be much
<PB N="196" REF="117">
amaz'd, saying, He never thought that the <HI>Ong</HI> of <HI>Batavia</HI> had had so many Rice-Roys under him, saying, Can it be possible? <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> smiling said, He hop'd that his Highness should find that it was true, and thereupon nam'd most of them: after which the Vice-Roy looking stedfastly on all his Coun|cellors and <HI>Mandarins,</HI> who bowed their Heads, shewing him reverence. Then his Highness giving a Nod, all the Tables were brought in, furnish'd with Silver Chargers and golden Goblets, which fill'd with variety of Meats, made up a most noble Entertainment. The Vice-Roy was at this time more than ordinarily merry, beginning several Healths one after another.</P>
<P>Whilst they were at Dinner, to recreate their Eyes and Ears, as well as satis|fie their Appetites, exquisite Musick was presented, with Masquing, Dancing, and other Princely Recreations.</P>
<P>After having drank very plentifully, <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> desir'd to take his Leave: whereupon the Vice-Roy commanded three great Bowls, Cut and Turn'd of a <HI>Rhinocerots</HI> Horn, to be fetch'd, one for himself, one for <HI>Hogenhoek,</HI> and a third for Factor <HI>Pedell,</HI> which they were to drink out three times one after another, before he would permit them to go, which accordingly they did.</P>
<P>Lastly, standing up to return Thanks and take their Leave, his Highness said, That the Discourse which he had had with <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> he must within three or four days advise the Emperor of, because his Majesty and Council ex|pected it. And here again he warn'd him to take heed that all were truth, for upon the least prevarication his Majesty and Council would be very much dis|satisfi'd: Upon which <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> assur'd the Vice-Roy, that all was true which he had related. Whereupon he departed, and coming home in the afternoon, he heard that the General <HI>Lipovi</HI> had on the Morrow invited him to be his Guest, and also to tell him that the Letters were come from Court.</P>
<P>On <HI>Monday</HI> the twentieth, <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> went with all his Train to the General <HI>Lipovi</HI>'s House, where he was Entertain'd with the like Discourse as he had with the Vice-Roy. Mean while, the Copy of the Letter which the Vice-Roy spoke of on the twenty fourth was sent to the Agent, which being transla|ted was to this effect:</P>

</LETTER>
<P>On <HI>Tuesday</HI> the twenty sixth <HI>Lipovi</HI>'s Secretary, with some Commissioners and <HI>Mandarins</HI> came to Visit <HI>Hogenhoek;</HI> where after a Dish of <HI>Tee,</HI> the Com|missioners said, They were come thither purposely to hear the Lord General of <HI>Batavia</HI>'s Name, and how he was styl'd, because there was some difference in the Name and Titles of the Letters, which were sent from thence to <HI>Canton.</HI> 'Tis true (said he) their Highness's <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi</HI> had already satisfi'd me, but I must hear it from your own Mouth, that I may the better render an account of it to his Imperial Majesty; being therefore sent hither, and that his great Master desir'd to know his true Title, that he might address himself the better with Presents. Hereupon the Agent drew a Letter out of his Pock|et directed to him, which contain'd the Lord Generals Title and Names, as <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> had given them to <HI>Singlamong</HI> and <HI>Lipovi,</HI> which was in these words: <HI>Captain Moor of India, Iohn Maetzuiker, residing in Batavia:</HI> but according to their manner of writing, they had writ <HI>Captain Moor of India, Maetzuiker Iohn,</HI> writing his Sur-name first, and his Christen-name afterwards. Then one of the Com|missioners from <HI>Peking</HI> said, That <HI>Holland</HI> must needs be a fertile Countrey, from whence so many good things come; asking also some ordinary Questi|ons, as it is usual there; which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> onely answer'd with a Smile: whereupon the Agents and <HI>Mandarins</HI> taking their Leave went home.</P>
<P>On <HI>Wednesday,</HI> being the twenty seventh, <HI>Coxinga</HI>'s Mother came with his Brother <HI>Sibya</HI> to <HI>Hoksieu</HI> (who had submitted her self to the <HI>Tartars</HI> that Year before the <HI>Dutch</HI> Fleet came thither) to desire their Excellencies to furnish them with Guides to go to <HI>Peking,</HI> the Emperor having sent for them to come and live there for the prevention of further trouble and inconveniences.</P>
<P>The twenty eighth General <HI>Lipovi</HI> sent a <HI>Mandarin</HI> to <HI>Hogenhoek,</HI> to tell him it would be necessary for him to conduct the Emperors Commissioners out of the City, because they had taken so great a Journey for his Business, and also to Pre|sent them with something that was handsom. Whereupon <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> ask'd him if his Lord had not told him what he was best to Present: to which he said, With fifty or sixty Tail of Silver, and when he deliver'd them, to tell them, That all his Goods were sold, and that they would except of that Sum to buy Tobacco with on the Way. Hereupon <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> making himself ready, went to take Leave of the Agents and their Retinue, taking with him sixty Tail of Silver, <HI>viz.</HI> twenty five for the first Agent, fifteen for the second, seven for the Heralds, and five for some of the Attendants: Coming to them, he presented the Money as he had put it up handsom in Papers in several Parcels; which they receiv'd very thankfully, with promises, That when they came to <HI>Peking</HI> they would not fail to Serve the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in what they could possible: where|upon <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> return'd to his Lodgings.</P>
<P>SInce the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> and the Towns and Cities belonging to it, have often been made mention of, and hereafter will be more, our Bu|siness seems here to require a brief Description thereof.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Borders&punc;</NOTE></P>
<P>This Province, one of the fifteen which make up <HI>China, Paulus Venetus</HI> sets forth by the Name of <HI>Fugui,</HI> taken from the Metropolis <HI>Focheu:</HI> It borders the
<PB N="198" REF="118">
Sea from East to South; in the South-west, on <HI>Quantung;</HI> West and Nor-West conterminates <HI>Kiangsi;</HI> the remaining part from the North-west to the North|east verges upon the Countrey of <HI>Chekiang.</HI></P>
<P>This Province is the smallest in the Empire of <HI>China:</HI> the Southermost part of it lies in twenty four Degrees and forty five Minutes, extending to twenty eight Degrees and thirty Minutes Northern Latitude; a Tract of sixty one <HI>German,</HI> or two hundred forty four <HI>English</HI> Miles.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Min,</HI> or rather several Dominions, over which the Free Lords call'd <HI>Min,</HI> Commanded, were antiently accounted into this Territory. They divide it into eight Shires or Counties, as we may call them, whereof <HI>Focheusu</HI> the chief, <HI>Cineucheufu, Changcheufu, Kienningfu, Ienpingfu, Tingcheufu, Hinghoafu, Xaounfu,</HI> besides the small Colony of <HI>Foning:</HI> every one hath seve|ral Towns and Cities, to the number of fifty six, belonging to them, besides two fortifi'd Cities, and many Castles and Strong-holds at the Sea-side.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Borders.</NOTE></P>
<P>The first County <HI>Focheufu,</HI> borders Easterly at the Sea; on the North, at <HI>Fo|ningfu</HI> and <HI>Kienningfu;</HI> on the West, upon <HI>Ienpingfu;</HI> and the South looks upon <HI>Hinghoafu.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chinese</HI> Records tell us, that this Countrey was first planted by a Fami|ly call'd <HI>Cheu,</HI> and by them nam'd <HI>Min;</HI> notwithstanding it did not then be|long to the Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> but to certain Free Lords which they call'd the <HI>Min.</HI> The first that joyn'd it to the Empire of <HI>China</HI> was the chief of the Fa|mily <HI>Cheu;</HI> yet the Inhabitants soon shook off that Yoke, and kept themselves free, till the fortunate and valiant Emperor <HI>Hiaou,</HI> of the Family of <HI>Han,</HI> re|duced and added it to <HI>China,</HI> with all the Southern Territories, setling them in Peace, and placed a Vice-Roy over it, call'd <HI>Veuching,</HI> who kept his Court in the Metropolis thereof. <HI>Cyn,</HI> the first King thereof, call'd the chief City, and the Tract of Land thereto belonging, <HI>Cyngan;</HI> the next King <HI>Sui</HI> nam'd the Coun|trey, <HI>Mencheu;</HI> but the <HI>Tangs,</HI> of another Line, <HI>Kiencheu,</HI> and not long after <HI>Fo|cheu;</HI> which Name the <HI>Taimingian</HI> Race kept ever since.</P>
<P>This Countrey <HI>Focheufu</HI> contains eight Cities, <HI>Focheu</HI> the Metropolis, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cities.</NOTE> chief of all the Countrey, otherwise call'd <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> or <HI>Hokzieuw, Cutien, Mincing, Changlo, Lienkiang, Loquen, Iangfo, Focing.</HI></P>
<P>The City <HI>Focheu,</HI> by <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> call'd <HI>Fugui,</HI> lieth about fifteen Leagues Westerly from the Sea, on the Southern Shore of the River <HI>Min,</HI> which with a wide Mouth falls Easterly into the Sea, and brings both great and small Ves|sels up to the City Walls. The convenience of this River makes the Town very populous and of great Trade: It is adorn'd with fair Buildings, and hath large Suburbs, call'd <HI>Nantai,</HI> otherwise, according to the pronunciation of the Inhabitants, <HI>Lamthay;</HI> for those in <HI>Fokien</HI> use in stead of <HI>N</HI> the Letter <HI>L.</HI> and often say <HI>Lamking</HI> in stead of <HI>Nanking:</HI> There are also many Idol Temples.</P>
<P>Cross the Bay near <HI>Nantai,</HI> lies a Stone Bridge, a hundred and fifty Rods long, and one and a half broad, built all of white Free-stone, resting on a hun|dred very high Arches; on the top of each side are Rails and Benches; adorn'd at an equal distance, with Lyons neatly cut of Stone.</P>
<P>Next this Bridge, at the South end, stands a fair and large <HI>Pagode,</HI> or Temple.</P>
<P>Another Bridge not unlike this, being a hundred Rods long, may be seen at the City <HI>Focing.</HI> And many more are without and within the Walls of the chiefest Cities.</P>
<P>Three Leagues from <HI>Focheu</HI> stands a Temple call'd <HI>Kouzan,</HI> the largest of all in the Nether Provinces.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="118">The second Division, <HI>Civencheufu,</HI> borders from the East to the South-east,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Borders.</NOTE> and so to the South upon the Sea; and from the South-west to the West, tou|ches <HI>Chancheufu;</HI> and on the North verges with <HI>Ienpingfu.</HI></P>
<P>This Countrey formerly belong'd to the Princes <HI>Min:</HI> and hath seven Ci|ties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cities.</NOTE> <HI>Civencheu</HI> the chief, <HI>Nangan, Hocigan, Tehoa, Ganki, Tunygan,</HI> and <HI>Iungehung.</HI></P>
<P>The City <HI>Civencheu</HI> lies near the Sea in a delightful Plain, and admits by a large Bay the greatest Ships to Ride close under the Walls, not onely on one but both sides of the City, for it is built on a Promontory encompass'd with Water, except on the North and South-east sides.</P>
<P>On the opposite Shore are many populous and Trading Towns, and chief|ly on a Place towards the North-west call'd <HI>Loyang,</HI> which may rather be look'd upon as great Cities. There also is a Bridge which hath the same denomina|tion with the Town, the whole World not shewing the like; for it consists of a black Stone like Touch-stone, not supported with Arches, but above three hundred square Columns, sharp above Bridge and below, the better to break the impetuous egress and regress of the Current. These Pillars are Capp'd, to walk upon, with five Stones of an exact breadth, each eighteen Paces long, and two broad, which successively touch one another at either Foot of the Bridge; of which there are to the number of a hundred and forty: it is cer|tainly a Miracle of Workmanship, not onely for its great number of Stones of such a bigness, that rest on those Columns, but most of all, where so many large and equal Stones could be had: on each side, to make the Passage the safer, are Rails of the same Stones, adorn'd with Lyons, standing on Pedestals, and other Imagery.</P>
<P>It is worth our observation what is written of one part of this Bridge, that is between a Village call'd <HI>Loyan,</HI> and a Castle built on the Bridge; for be|yond the Village reaches another part, not much less than the former, and of one make: A <HI>Chinese</HI> Writer saith thus concerning it:</P>
<P><HI>This part of the Bridge</HI> Loyang, <HI>and also call'd</HI> Vangan, <HI>lying on the North-west side of the City, cross the River</HI> Loyang, <HI>was built by a Governor, call'd</HI> Cayang: <HI>it extends in length to about three hundred and sixty Rods, and in breadth one and a half. Before this Bridge was built they cross'd the River in Boats; but because every year many Vessels were by Storm cast away,</HI> Cayang <HI>resolv'd, for the safety of Passengers, to build a Bridge; but seeing such a great piece of Work to be too much for Mankind to undertake, and also the Water too deep to lay a Foundation in it, he invok'd the Gods of the Sea</HI> (as he says) <HI>for some time to stop the Current of the Water; which</HI> (if you will believe) <HI>he ob|tain'd. After the Essluxes were stay'd, and no Tydes swelling the River in one and twenty days, the Foundation was laid, and forty hundred thousand Tail spent in the building of it.</HI></P>
<P>The third Province call'd <HI>Chancheufu,</HI> being the most Southern of all this<NOTE PLACE="marg">Borders.</NOTE> Territory, borders in the North-East and East with <HI>Civenchufu;</HI> on the East South-East and South, with the Sea; on the South-West touches the Coun|trey of <HI>Quantung;</HI> on the West and North-West, and North, at <HI>Tingcheufu.</HI></P>
<P>It contains ten Cities, of which <HI>Chancheu</HI> is the chiefest; the rest are <HI>Changpu,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns.</NOTE> <HI>Lugnien, Nancing, Changtai, Changping, Pingho, Chaogang, Huicing,</HI> and <HI>Ningyang.</HI></P>
<P>The Name of <HI>Chancheu</HI> was first given to this Metropolis and Countrey by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Names.</NOTE> the Family of the <HI>Tang,</HI> from the River <HI>Chang,</HI> on whose Western Shore situate, and was then allow'd the priviledge of a small City; but the <HI>Iuem</HI> made her afterwards a Metropolis; and at the same time built the small City <HI>Nancing:</HI> from whence Father <HI>Martin</HI> concludes, that then all these Places
<PB N="200" REF="119">
were much frequented by Navigators, and that <HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> his <HI>Zerte</HI> must needs be thereabouts.</P>
<P>On the South-side, where the River also washes the City, is a large Bridge of Hew'n-stone, with thirty six high Arches, and so broad, that on each side are divers Tradesmen and Artificers Shops, in which they sell every day all manner of rich and foreign Commodities, which are brought thither from <HI>Hiamuen.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth call'd <HI>Kienningfu,</HI> a very wide and spacious piece of Land, bor|ders<NOTE PLACE="marg">Borders.</NOTE> on the North and North-East, upon <HI>Chekiang;</HI> on the East, with <HI>Foningfu;</HI> on the South, at <HI>Focheufu</HI> and <HI>Ienpingfu;</HI> on the West, at <HI>Xaonufu;</HI> on the North; West and North, upon <HI>Kiangsi.</HI></P>
<P>This Division belong'd antiently to the Princes <HI>Min;</HI> after which the Fa|mily<NOTE PLACE="marg">Names.</NOTE> <HI>Tang</HI> gave it the Name of <HI>Kiencheu;</HI> and <HI>Sung,</HI> another Race, that which it hath at present.</P>
<P>Here are seven Towns, whereof <HI>Kienning</HI> is the chiefest; the rest are <HI>Cungan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns.</NOTE> <HI>Puchiang, Chingo, Sunghi, and Xeuning.</HI></P>
<P>The City <HI>Kienning</HI> lying on the Eastern Shore of the River <HI>Min,</HI> is no way inferior, either in beauty or worth, or bigness, to the Metropolis. Father <HI>Mar|tin</HI> affirms this City to be <HI>Venetus</HI> his <HI>Quelingfu.</HI></P>
<P>In this last <HI>Tartarick</HI> War this City suffer'd much damage; for having re|volted from the <HI>Tartars,</HI> it was taken after a long Siege, and laid in Ashes, and all the Inhabitants put to the Sword. The Fire consum'd here a Bridge over the swift River <HI>Min,</HI> the Pillars whereof were of an exceeding heighth of Free|stone, the other parts of Wood, beautifi'd on the top with Houses and Shops on each side: but since by re-building it hath re-gain'd somewhat of former lustre. Beyond the Bridge, on the opposite Shore, stands a stately <HI>Pagode.</HI></P>
<P>Most of the new Buildings fall short of their old beauty, notwithstanding the <HI>Chinese</HI> Towns that are consum'd by Fire, are much more easily re-built than those in <HI>Europe,</HI> because most of them are nothing but Wood.</P>
<P>Near the City <HI>Kienning</HI> is another fair Bridge, with Shops and Houses on both sides.</P>
<P>This City <HI>Kienning</HI> is a Place of great Trade; for all those Commodities that come either up or down the River must pass through it. When they come to the City <HI>Pucing,</HI> they are taken out of the Vessels, and by Porters car|ry'd to a Village call'd <HI>Pinghu,</HI> belonging to the City <HI>Kiangxan,</HI> over high Mountains and deep Valleys four days Journey: In like manner they are car|ry'd from <HI>Pinghu</HI> to <HI>Puching.</HI> The whole Way, as much as is possible to be done by the Art or Labor of Man, is made even, and Pav'd with square Stones, along whose sides are built many Houses and Villages, onely to entertain Travellers. The Merchandises being first weighed, are deliver'd to the Ma|ster of the Inn, which send them for a certain Gratuity by Porters to other Pla|ces, where the Merchant without any trouble receives them: If any thing chance to be lost, the Host is bound to make it good. Here are always above ten thousand Porters ready, which wait to receive the Goods, and carry them over the Mountains. Because of this Carriage of so many Goods, a House stands erected for the receiving a small Custom, or Duty, towards the main|taining and reparation of the High-ways.</P>
<P>The fifth Tract of Land, call'd <HI>Ienpingfu,</HI> makes the Centre of this Territo|ry, and borders in the East, at the chief County <HI>Focheufu;</HI> in the South and South-West, at <HI>Civencheufu</HI> and <HI>Kancheufu;</HI> on the West and North at <HI>Tingcheu|fu, Xaounfu,</HI> and <HI>Kienningfu.</HI></P>

<P>The City <HI>Ienping</HI> lieth on the Western Shore of the River <HI>Min,</HI> from whence it rises with its Buildings up the Hills, rendring a delightful Prospect to those that pass by, and though none of the biggest, yet it is beautifi'd with several fair Houses: The Walls exceed in heighth the neighboring Ascents, which on the out-sides are inaccessible, making the City very strong, and indeed the Key to the whole Territory.</P>

<P>_WHat Troubles, Charges, and Endeavors the <HI>Netherland East-India</HI> Company, and their Magistrates in <HI>India,</HI> have some Years since us'd from time to time, on se|veral Occasions, for the gaining of their so long wish'd for <HI>Chinese</HI> Trade, it would be needless here to describe, because we may plainly perceive it from other Dis|courses, especially by the former Embassies and Expe|ditions under the Conduct of <HI>Peter de Goyer</HI> and <HI>Iacob de Keizer,</HI> sent out <HI>Anno</HI> 1655. and 1656.

<P>Yet after long Referrings, Debates, and serious Considerations, it was at last again concluded, on the twenty eighth of <HI>May, Anno</HI> 1666, by the Lord General and Council of <HI>India,</HI> to send a Magnificent Embassy, with rich Pre|sents, to the <HI>Tartars</HI> Court, to the Great Emperor of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>East-Tartary,</HI> that if possible, they might at last attain to their so long desir'd Free Trade through the whole Realm of <HI>China.</HI></P>

<P>After a kind Farewell, the foremention'd Persons return'd ashore.</P>
<P>For the more Honorable carrying on of this Embassy, a Fleet of five Sail, Laden with Presents and Merchandise, and Mann'd with Soldiers and Sea|men, was fitted out from <HI>Batavia,</HI> consisting in these Ships, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Vlaerding, Afen, Constance, Gilded Tygre,</HI> and The <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat, Commanded by <HI>Iohn vander Werf. Iohn Naelhout. Iohn Hendricks. Henry Bommer. Peter Iansz.</HI></P>
<P>Several <HI>Chineses</HI> also Shipp'd themselves in the Fleet, to return to their Na|tive Countrey, from whence they came some Years before, and had setled themselves in <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> in the Morning the Fleet set Sail, and lying by the Lee about the Islands, they staid for some ready Moneys, and other Necessa|ries, which about seven a clock were brought them by one <HI>Simon de Danser,</HI> Master of the Exchequer. Then the Fleet weighing Anchor again, ran East|erly, between the Isles <HI>Edam</HI> and <HI>Alkmaer,</HI> that they might have the advantage of the Eastern <HI>Mouson</HI> (but the Wind, on the contrary, in the Afternoon came
<PB N="205" REF="121">
about to the West) and then tack'd to and again, having the Wind about seven a clock at Night to the South-West; then they steer'd their Course Northerly, and so proceeded in the same Course as we have fully mention'd in their for|mer Journals from <HI>Batavia;</HI> and therefore we think not fit to trouble the Rea|der with needless Repetitions of the same things.</P>
<P>The fifth of <HI>August</HI> about Noon they came to the <HI>Netherland</HI>-Haven, where a <HI>Tartar</HI> came aboard of the Ambassador in a small Vessel, who said that he was sent from the Governor of <HI>Minjazen,</HI> to inquire what People and Ships they were, and also from whence they came, and what Persons of Quality were in them? Whereupon being answer'd accordingly, the <HI>Tartar</HI> return'd ashore, to give an Accompt thereof, having first inform'd them of the General <HI>Lipovi</HI>'s Death.</P>
<P>The sixth in the Morning, while they still rode at an Anchor, waiting for the Fleet to carry them into the <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, there also came a <HI>Tartar</HI> Vessel aboard, with the third Person of <HI>Minjazen,</HI> to ask in the Governors Name, What Ships they were, and if an Ambassador was come with them to the Emperor? Whereupon the Ambassador answer'd him accordingly, and also told him, That they intended to send the Master of the Ceremonies, and Mr. <HI>Ruwenoort,</HI> with the Interpreter <HI>De Hase,</HI> to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> with Letters to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong,</HI> and the new General which was come from <HI>Peking</HI> in the deceas'd <HI>Lipovi</HI>'s Place: To whom the <HI>Mandarin</HI> proffer'd his Service to carry them to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> alledging, That he was sent from the Governor for that pur|pose.</P>
<P>After having receiv'd Thanks from the Ambassador, he return'd with the foremention'd Persons aboard of the <HI>Blyswiik,</HI> where the Letter was translated into the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue: The Contents were to this purpose.</P>
<P>That this Letter was to advise their Excellencies from the Lord Ambassa|dor, of the coming of five Ships, laden with several Merchandises, and Pre|sents for his Majesty, and their Excellencies the Vice-Roy, General, and <HI>Con|bon,</HI> or Governor, and likewise of his coming from <HI>Batavia</HI> in the beginning of the last Month, with the Merchant <HI>Constantine Nobel,</HI> and their safe Arrival in the beginning of the New Moon before the River of <HI>Hoksieu.</HI></P>
<P>Their Highnesses also were desired to permit the Merchant <HI>Constantine No|bel</HI> with the first opportunity to come to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> to complement their Ex|cellencies from the Ambassador, and acquaint them with his Intentions.</P>
<P>About Noon the <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador arriv'd in safety in the <HI>Netherland</HI>-Ha|ven, where he drop'd Anchor with the <HI>Vlaerding</HI> and <HI>Blyswiik,</HI> and was visited by the chief Pilot of the <HI>Tygre,</HI> with a Letter from <HI>Hendrick Bommer</HI> Master of the <HI>Tygre,</HI> written to the Ambassador, signifying, That the Pilot beforemen|tion'd, having been several times in the <HI>Netherland</HI>-Haven, made no question to bring the <HI>Tygre</HI> thither; so that he desir'd his Order, because the Ship would be safer there than in the Bay of <HI>Sothia.</HI> On which the Ambassa|dor made answer, That he ought to govern himself according to the Agree|ment made on the fifth Instant, of which the Copy was sent him, and first steer his Course to the Bay of <HI>Sothia,</HI> till further Order came from above.</P>
<P>The Ambassador observing, That the entring into the Mouth of the River <HI>Hoksieu</HI> was dangerous, because of the Rocks call'd the <HI>Pyramides,</HI> commanded all the Masters and Pilots to consult about it, and give their Opinions in Wri|ting, that other Ships that should come after, might make use thereof.</P>
<P>The seventh against Noon three <HI>Mandarins</HI> were sent from the new General
<PB N="206" REF="122">
<HI>Siangpovi,</HI> to see how many Ships and Men were come, and likewise what Pre|sents they had brought, from whence the Ambassador came, and what Retinue he intended should go with him to <HI>Peking.</HI> But the Ambassador did not think it convenient to inform him of all things, because the Master of the Ceremo|nies and Interpreter were not yet come from <HI>Hoksieu;</HI> therefore he told the <HI>Mandarins</HI> onely, That he was come thither with five Ships, of which three lay in the Bay of <HI>Sothia,</HI> and two in the <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven; and that he had four hundred Men aboard: but as to the Presents, he could not readily give an Ac|count, because he must first unpack them, and then draw an Inventory in <HI>Chi|nese:</HI> neither could he yet tell them the Number of the Persons that were to attend him to the Court; but if they pleas'd to stay till to morrow (when he ex|pected the Master of the Ceremonies and Interpreter would be there) he would resolve them. Then the <HI>Mandarins</HI> ask'd, If there were no more Ships that had put into other Harbors on the Coast of <HI>China?</HI> To which they were answer'd <HI>No.</HI> Then they demanded further, From whom the Lord Ambassador was ad|dress'd? to which they receiv'd a suitable Answer. The Ambassador had also a <HI>Chinese</HI> Letter given him from the Governor of <HI>Minjazen,</HI> the Contents being onely to congratulate his Welcome, which the Ambassador answer'd civilly in like manner. Hereupon the <HI>Mandarins</HI> departed, saying, they would send one on the Morrow to know the Quantity and Quality of the Presents.</P>
<P>The Ambassador soon after was inform'd by <HI>Nobel,</HI> That the <HI>Mandarin</HI> which bore the chief Command over the Jonks that lay there, had understood the day before, that the Emperor was inclin'd to allow the <HI>Hollanders</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> the Isles <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> to set up their Factories and Trade.</P>
<P>The eighth the Master of the Ceremonies, Mr. <HI>Ruwenoort,</HI> and the Interpre|ter <HI>De Hase,</HI> came aboard again, relating, That they had been at <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and there deliver'd the Ambassadors Letters to the Governors: The General, who first granted them Audience, had after the reading of the Letter ask'd them several Questions, as amongst others, Whither they had a Design upon <HI>Formosa,</HI> or came onely upon Embassy? To which they answer'd, That the Ambassa|dor was come thither but with five Ships, of which two lay in the <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, and three at <HI>Tinhay;</HI> and that they had no other Design but to wait up|on the Emperor, according to the Contents of their Credential Letters and Commission. After this, they gave the <HI>Conbon</HI> or Governor of <HI>Hoksieu</HI> a Visit, who shew'd himself very joyful at the news of their arrival. And next they visited the General, and gave him an Account of the Ambassadors arrival, who sent two <HI>Mandarins</HI> to go along them.</P>
<P>About Midnight in their Return they came before the Castle of <HI>Minjazen,</HI> where they lay till the next Morning, and then desir'd the Governor to fur|nish them with a Vessel to carry them aboard, to which he very willingly con|descended.</P>
<P>The ninth <HI>Nobel, Harthower,</HI> Secretary <HI>Vander Does,</HI> and the <HI>Mandarins</HI> which came down the next day in a Pleasure-Boat sent to the Fleet for that purpose, were carried aboard, having a Letter of Advice with them, to make use of when occasion should serve.</P>

<P>The eleventh in the Morning, the Ambassador sent the <HI>Blyswiik's</HI> Boat to the Bay of <HI>Sothia,</HI> with a Letter; by which he Commanded the Captains of the three Ships, the <HI>Alfen, Tyger,</HI> and <HI>Constance,</HI> to come to him with the first fair Weather, to consult once more about the bringing in of the Ships to <HI>Hoksieu.</HI></P>
<P>The twelfth, the Captains came according to the Ambassadors Letter aboard his Ship in their Sloop, and just at low Water they went with Captain <HI>Vander Werff,</HI> and <HI>Peter Iansz Vlieg,</HI> to the River of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> to know the Soundings and the breadth of the Channel.</P>
<P>Afternoon, <HI>Siangpovi</HI>'s Interpreter came aboard with some <HI>Tartars,</HI> to tell the Ambassador, that <HI>Nobel</HI> Landed the Night before in <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and that Horses were provided against the Morning to carry him to the Governors to have Audience. Moreover he told him, that he was sent from the General <HI>Siang|povi,</HI> to inquire about the Ambassadors Health, and if he wanted any thing, or if any surly People slighted or neglected, to supply them with what necessa|ries were fit, and they requir'd.</P>
<P>The Ambassador caus'd his Interpreter <HI>De Hase</HI> to ask the <HI>Tartars,</HI> How the Governor of <HI>Hoksieu</HI> resented the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and whether he should be civilly receiv'd? Whereupon he reply'd, That he needed not question his glad Re|ception.</P>
<P>Furthermore, he doubted not but that they should have all their desires gran|ted when so er'e they arriv'd at <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Tartar</HI> Interpreter also acquainted the Ambassador, that it would be convenient to invite the Captain of the Jonks that lay to watch to a Treat; which some hours afterwards was perform'd by <HI>Putmans,</HI> and the Interpreter <HI>De Hase;</HI> who coming to the Captain, and <HI>Mandarin,</HI> were kindly entertain'd, with answer, that according to their Requests, they and some other <HI>Mandarins</HI> would wait upon them the day following: They also sent a Present to the Am|bassador, of Capons, Geese, and a Vessel of <HI>Chinese</HI> strong Drink.</P>
<P>Towards Evening, the Masters and Pilots came aboard again to the Am|bassador, and told him, That he had search'd the Bay of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> of which they would give an account in writing, how the Ships should get in and out with most safety, as was done the day following.</P>
<P>In the afternoon the <HI>Vlaerdings</HI> Boat brought a supply from <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> of Beeves, Porkers, good Liquor, and several Fruits, with Letters from <HI>Nobel, Harthower,</HI> and <HI>Vander Does,</HI> that on the eleventh they were arriv'd at the Bridge of <HI>Lamthay;</HI> and at their passing by, the Governors of <HI>Minjazen</HI> Treated them kindly; and at <HI>Hoksieu</HI> they were presently admitted to the Presence of the Ge|neral <HI>Siangpovi,</HI> the Vice-Roy, and the <HI>Conbon</HI> or Governor.</P>

<P>The sixteenth, four <HI>Mandarins</HI> came from the General <HI>Siangpovi</HI> and the <HI>Con|bon,</HI> sent to the Ambassador to Present him with an hundred and twenty <HI>Cana|sters,</HI> or four Tun of Rice, thirty couple of Capons, as many Ducks, forty great Vessels of their best Drink, six fat Beeves, twenty Porkers, a Score and a half of Geese, and a hundred Water-Lemons.</P>
<P>Because the Name of <HI>Chinese</HI> Beer will be often us'd, it will be requisite to give a short Description of it.</P>
<P>THe Drinks which the <HI>Chineses</HI> use are many: The first call'd <HI>Samfoe,</HI> or <HI>Sampe,</HI> made of Rice, is of a clear Colour, like white Wine; wherefore they also name it, <HI>Sampe,</HI> signifying pure White.</P>
<P>The second call'd <HI>Looszioe,</HI> is of a brown Colour like <HI>Dutch</HI> Beer, of a plea|sant Taste, but very strong.</P>
<P>The third nam'd <HI>Tzonzui,</HI> and by some held for the best and strongest Li|quor in all <HI>China;</HI> is of a bright Brown, very clear, and resembles <HI>Brunswick-Mum,</HI> yet tastes like Sack, and as strong in its Operation.</P>
<P>Which Liquor Vulgarly the <HI>Hollanders</HI> generally call <HI>Mandarins</HI> and <HI>Chi|nese</HI> Beer.</P>
<P>The fourth being a sort of Distill'd Water, is call'd <HI>Hotzioe,</HI> and is not only clearer, but much stronger than <HI>Brandy,</HI> therefore by the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> call'd <HI>Strong Arak.</HI></P>
<P>The fifth Drink is call'd <HI>Kietzjoe,</HI> and by the <HI>Hollanders Kniep;</HI> and is also a Water Distill'd, yet not so strong as the former, of a ruddy Colour, and much drank in the <HI>Chinese</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> Ships, during their stay on the Coast of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>Most of all these Liquors are made and Extracted out of Rice.</P>
<P>They say, That in the Emperor <HI>Yu</HI>'s Raign, above two thousand Years be|fore<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin Histor. Sinen. l. 2. <HI>pag. 54.</HI></NOTE> the Birth of our Savior, this famous <HI>Chinese</HI> Drink, Extracted of Rice, was first made: The Inventer thereof was call'd <HI>Ilie,</HI> who having Presented the Emperor with the new and pleasant Liquor, when he had well tasted it, said, What great Misfortune hath brought this Drink into the Realm? Now I foresee the fall of my Family, and the ruine of the Empire by this inebriating Drink: Whereupon, he straight, instead of reward and honoring him for his happy Invention, being such an assistant to weaken Nature, banish'd him the Em|pire for ever; and Commanded further upon pain of Death, that none should imitate or experiment the same: But though <HI>Yu</HI> Banish'd the first finder, yet he could not prevent the Art of making it, from spreading through his whole Dominions.</P>
<P>Besides these Drinks, there is an ordinary sort boyl'd of the Root <HI>Tee,</HI> or <HI>Cha;</HI> and likewise another, by the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> call'd <HI>Bean Broth,</HI> which, as some say, is Milk mixt with <HI>Peking</HI> Butter.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="123">The <HI>Chineses</HI> also Press several sorts of Juyces, or Wines out of Fruit; as among other out of the Fruit <HI>Lichi.</HI></P>
<P>Yet in no place, do they know any Liquor made of Grapes; that kind of Tope only belonging to the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> though they have store of Grapes and Vineyards in other parts of <HI>China;</HI> for the <HI>Chineses</HI> either dry or Preserve their Grapes, to eat them in Winter, which they do by Boyling in a great Pot, and then pour dissolv'd Sugar upon them.</P>
<P>Upon the delivery of the foremention'd Presents, <HI>Singlamong</HI> was not once made mention of, which occasion'd some jealous thoughts.</P>
<P>And now, because the Ambassador expected that he should Land shortly, he made an Order for his Attendants, and Information to the Comptroller, to be observ'd at his Landing, thereby to shun all Confusions, according to which every one was to govern himself.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">

<P>The same day nothing happen'd of remark, only the General <HI>Povi</HI>'s Inter|preter came to visit the Ambassador, and tell him, That the Vessels which were to take in the Steeds, would either come that Night, or early in the Morning.</P>
<P>The following day, soon after Sun-rising, the foremention'd Interpreter, with two Captains belonging to the Jonks, came aboard of the Ambassador, to acquaint him of the two Vessels arrival, to fetch the Emperors Presents, the Horses and Oxen.</P>
<P>After some Discourse it was concluded, That the foremention'd Captains should the next Ebb go and fetch the Horses with their great Jonks; to which purpose, the Comptroller <HI>Ruwenoort</HI> was sent with them.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, the Ambassadors Boat came again from above the River, with the Secretary <HI>Vander Does,</HI> who besides his own Relations, brought two Letters, one from <HI>Nobel</HI> alone, and the other Sign'd by three, in which was written, That they had acquainted his Highness of the Ambassadors intentions to Land, whereupon they had obtain'd leave to send the Secretary <HI>Vander Does</HI> with the Boat.</P>
<P>In which were also brought a dozen Porkers, four Baskets with Artichokes, two with Cucumbers, and fifty Pots of <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">A <HI>Chinese</HI> Strong-Water.</NOTE> <HI>Chamchoe;</HI> and that it was conclu|ded, that twelve Men should first go ashore with the Ambassador, and that he should bring the Emperors Letter with him.</P>
<P>By the same Letters they also inform'd him, That the General had desir'd them to procure some Glasses, Quilts, Blood-Coral, and several other things for him which they had aboard, and could have wish'd, that they had been Shipt uppermost, because his Favor was of great concern, and they might do some good with him by the way of Presents, as they were inform'd, he being of a more affable Character than his Predecessor. And <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Harthower</HI> told him, That the Ambassador was not concern'd in the Trade, but it was intrust|ed wholly to them; so that without doubt, the Ambassador would not be troubled about it; therefore they would on this first undertaking so prosecute their business, that it might tend to his Honor; so that they desir'd he would please to leave it to their care. They added further, that they esteem'd them|selves happy by the Ambassadors grave counsel to be provided against the <HI>Chi|neses</HI> Treachery. In the Trade nothing was to be done, but to use care and prudence, as in former times. If they intended to effect any thing, they must wait, yet not depend too much upon it. The Jonks which were should the Horses at <HI>Minjazen,</HI> were judg'd to be unfit to go to <HI>Sothia;</HI> therefore the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> desir'd, that they might be brought into the <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, in one of the Ships, from whence they would convey them up the River.</P>
<P>The Governors had lately chosen a place on the other side of the River, where they intended to request of the Emperor, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> might build a Store-house; but they knew not whether it was done out of their own incli|nation, or by the Emperors Order, (which perhaps had long since granted it.) They were inform'd, that about eight or ten days since, a Mastless Vessel ran into the <HI>Storm-Bay,</HI> and soon after went away again, and that the Comman|ders of her said, that they were sent from <HI>Batavia</HI> to <HI>Iapan,</HI> and likewise that
<PB N="212" REF="125">
an Ambassador was come thither with nine Ships; by which they suppos'd, that it was the <HI>Newpoort,</HI> because no other Ships knew of the Ambassadors coming.</P>
<P>There went also a rumor, That some <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ships were arriv'd at <HI>Makaw,</HI> and of an Ambassadors going to <HI>Peking,</HI> that came over in them.</P>
<P>The single Letter from <HI>Nobel</HI> was to this purpose: That Hopes and a good Heart was half their Business, and he much rejoyc'd at what the Ambassador had been pleas'd to write; but nothing more concern'd him, than the pro|moting and making the Embassy more Honorable, that it might be perform'd with all fitting Splendor and Magnificence, of which there were fair appear|ances. But because nothing could be assur'd from the <HI>Chineses</HI> looks, therefore time must produce it.</P>
<P>They declar'd, that all the Governors were exceedingly rejoyc'd at the Am|bassadors coming, and had never shown such great incouragements to their Design.</P>
<P>The nineteenth, the great Jonk which went the same day to fetch the Hor|ses, return'd, and brought a Letter from the Commander to this effect.</P>
<P>That that Morning he had receiv'd the Ambassadors Order, for the sending of the Horses and Oxen; according to which he had Shipt them in the Jonks, with three Chests full of Saddles, all in good condition, and that at their put|ting off, he had fir'd seven Guns in Honor of the Emperor, and the Ambassa|dor, which he hop'd he would opprove off.</P>
<P>His Excellency Commanded <HI>Ruwenoort,</HI> that so soon as it was Flood, he should go up with the Horses to <HI>Hocksieu,</HI> which was perform'd accordingly; and the Ambassador writ a Letter to <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Harthouwer,</HI> advising them, that he had receiv'd theirs by the Secretary, and prepar'd himself to go in the expected Vessels to <HI>Hoksieu;</HI> and in the mean while, had sent the Horses and Oxen, as also their Saddles, and the Coach provided for the Emperor.</P>
<P>The twentieth, nothing happen'd of remark.</P>
<P>The one and twentieth in the Morning, two Pleasure-Boats came with three <HI>Mandarins,</HI> two from the Vice-Roy and General, and one from the Go|vernor of <HI>Minjazen,</HI> to attend and bring in the Ambassador, who desir'd two days for the fitting and accommodating all things for his more convenient Landing.</P>
<P>The three and twentieth in the Morning, the two Pleasure-Boats before|mention'd, that came with the three <HI>Mandarins,</HI> were ready to take in the Am|bassador, but prov'd much too little to carry him, his Attendants and Goods up the River. And because they proffer'd as many Jonks on the one and twen|tieth as he should need, therefore they were desir'd to procure one more, which they scrupling, he said he had been told, that they were a well Go|vern'd Nation, and therefore wonder'd that they kept not their own promise, that he should have as many as he needed; therefore he would send one up to <HI>Hoksieu</HI> to fetch written Orders from the General, according to which he would Govern himself. Upon the news thereof, without any more ado, they sent a Jonk to carry his Goods, or any thing else; whereupon he gave Order for the Shipping of his Goods and Attendants.</P>
<P>At Noon, the Ambassador Imbark'd himself to go up to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and about three a Clock arriv'd at <HI>Minjazen;</HI> of which place the Governor sent him a Complemental Letter, informing him of his indispos'dness, which prevented him from giving the civility of a meeting. Moreover, he caus'd the Ambassa|dor
<PB N="213" REF="125">
and his Retinue to be Entertain'd with <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">As the <HI>Dutch</HI> call it.</NOTE> Bean-Broth, and Bak'd Meats.</P>
<P>The Governor of <HI>Minjazen</HI> also sent to desire the Ambassador to stay some short time, because he would send a Letter with him; and soon after, some <HI>Mandarins</HI> coming aboard said, That they were sent from the Governor to search all Chests and Trunks, which was so ill resented by the Ambassador, that he said with a displeas'd Countenance, the <HI>Mandarins</HI> had promis'd him, That his Goods should without trouble or molestation be deliver'd; and if they could not, he would rather return aboar'd, than suffer such affronts, which words made them wave their receiv'd Orders; yet he went away in the Even|ing without a Letter. The Ambassador, by reason of the Ebb meeting him, was forc'd to Anchor at <HI>Lamthay,</HI> and about Flood setting forward again, about Day light arriv'd at the Bridge of <HI>Lamthay.</HI> Here the <HI>Mandarins</HI> went to ac|quaint the General of the Ambassadors arrival, and also to know, if it pleas'd his Highness, that he should first go into the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> Inn, or come to his Highness: The Ambassador also made his coming immediately known to <HI>No|bel</HI> and <HI>Harthouwer,</HI> who came to welcome him; of whom he demanding, in what Postures Affairs stood; They told him, they had no present cause of dis|satisfaction, because the last Night <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s Secretary had come and told them, that seven hundred Bales of Silk lay in store, which were to be ex|chang'd for the <HI>Netherland</HI> Commodities, and also that <HI>Singlamong</HI> would have half a share in the Trade; The General two third parts in the other half, and the <HI>Conbon</HI> a third part.</P>
<P>The four and twentieth, after several Houses shewn, and deny'd, a <HI>Manda|rin</HI> came to ask if the Ambassador would be pleas'd to send one of his Servants to see the House which was chosen for him. Whereupon he sent <HI>Nobel, Putmans,</HI> and <HI>Ruwenoort</HI> to the General, to desire him, to give Order for a House.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mandarins</HI> which had fetch'd the Ambassador, and were that Morning gone to the General, to make his coming known, return'd with Horses to con|duct him to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Nobel, Putmans,</HI> and <HI>Ruwenoort</HI> came with the foremention'd <HI>Mandarins,</HI> to tell the Ambassador, that a House was making ready for him; also that his Highness expected him at Court, and before the Ambassador should have done his business with his Highness, the House would be ready.</P>
<P>The General also said, That if they had known of the Ambassadors coming from <HI>Batavia</HI> before hand, the Emperor would have given Order for the build|ing a new House.</P>
<P>And accordingly, although it Rain'd very hard, yet the Ambassador prepar'd himself to go to his Highness.</P>
<P>First, between the sound of several Instruments, he was conducted to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong,</HI> who bad him Welcome, and shew'd him to sit on a Bench at his left Hand, (by the <HI>Tartar</HI> accounted the upper) and next him <HI>Nobel, Harthouwer, Putmans,</HI> and the Secretary <HI>Vander Does,</HI> on a piece of Cloth spread on the Ground.</P>
<P>Then the Vice-Roy wish'd the Ambassador much joy, for which the Am|bassador with many Ceremonies thank'd him; so that this first Visit ended on|ly in Coplements.</P>
<P>He at last ask'd, If he had about him the Letter from his King to their Em|peror; and also, that with the first opportunity, they should give an account to the General, how many Chests and Trunks they wanted to carry up their Goods, that they might be got ready against the appointed time.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="126">And likewise, that the General might give Order for the Jonks and Vessels to fetch the Presents for the Emperor ashore: To which the Ambassador an|swer'd, That he had not brought the Letter with him, because of the badness of the Weather, but his Highness might Command it when he pleas'd; the number of Cases and Chests, he would also give an account of, as they had occasion, and so soon as they could come at the Presents, acquaint his High|ness with it.</P>
<P>Moreover, The Ambassador desir'd the Vice-Roy's advice, and instruction in this Embassy, which he would be sure to observe, and other such like Discour|ses. To which the Vice-Roy answer'd, That he would invite the Ambassador to his Court, and then they would further consult concerning all affairs.</P>
<P>From thence they went to the General, who enquired after the Ambassadors Health, and how all Friends far'd in <HI>Batavia?</HI> To which the Ambassador an|swer'd, and return'd him Thanks for sending the <HI>Mandarins</HI> to fetch him in, and also for the fresh Provisions. Then he ask'd the same question as the Vice-Roy had done before, whereon the Ambassador reply'd, That the Goods which were to be sold, lay upon the Presents; but he would give Order to <HI>Nobel</HI> to fetch them up, that they might be seen, and if they were damnifi'd, they should immediately be shown to his Highness; which said, his Highness was well satisfi'd, saying, That he would then write concerning it to the Court at <HI>Pe|king.</HI> The Ambassador also desir'd his Highness's advice, because he knew not the Customs and Fashions of the Countrey.</P>
<P>Moreover the Ambassador said, That he would on the Morrow present his Highness with some Glasses, and other such like Rarities, which he desir'd he would please to accept. His Highness inquir'd also of the Ambassador, if he had left good Orders on board, that his People us'd no Outrages, nor carry'd any Goods privately ashore; to which, the Ambassador said, <HI>Yes,</HI> and if any one should break such Orders, he should be severely punish'd.</P>
<P>The General shew'd the Ambassador two <HI>Mandarins,</HI> which (said he) shall wait upon you, when I intend to acquaint you with any thing of consequence, therefore desir'd him to grant them Audience. On which the Ambassador ta|king leave, was intreated by his Highness to Eat with him first, which was perform'd, and at Table said, That he would with the first opportunity in|vite the Ambassador to his Court, to Discourse with him concerning the Embassy.</P>
<P>From hence they went to the <HI>Conbon,</HI> whither they came about the Evening, and were kindly receiv'd and bid Welcome by him.</P>
<P>Moreover, the <HI>Conbon</HI> said, That the Ambassadors coming would prove an advantagious business to them, promising to assist him in all things he would desire. Whereupon the Ambassador taking leave, came to his Lodging about eight a Clock; about ten arose a mighty Storm out of the North, which last|ed till Midnight.</P>
<P>The twenty fifth in the Morning, they receiv'd the bad news, that the Jonks Laden with all their Travelling Necessaries was cast away, driven from the Anchor, and shatter'd in pieces against the Bridge of <HI>Lamthay.</HI> But <HI>Putmans</HI> and the Secretary were sent to see what could be sav'd of the Damnifi'd Goods. Towards Noon, the Vice-Roy and General sent them in all sorts of Kitchin Provision, of what the Countrey afforded, and some Vessels of their best Liquor.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="126">The General sent likewise a Pass to the Ambassador, for the fetching ashore the Emperors Presents; to which the Ambassador reply'd, That it could not be done before he Traded: But the <HI>Mandarin</HI> answer'd, That it must be, or else the General could not write to <HI>Peking:</HI> Whereupon the Ambassador told him, That he would visit the General on the morrow, and discourse with him about it; on which he went away.</P>
<P>Next Morning Captain <HI>Putmans</HI> went to Complement his Highness <HI>Singla|mong,</HI> and in the Ambassadors Name to present him with some Rarities, who himself was ready to repair to the Court, where a <HI>Mandarin</HI> gave him notice, That he was immediately expected; whither instantly going, and after some Complements had pass'd, he deliver'd him the Copy of the Letter to his Im|perial Majesty, with a List of the Persons Names that were to go to <HI>Peking</HI> with him; and also a Schedule, being an Abstract of the Embassy, which was to this purpose.</P>
<Q><P>That the Lord General <HI>Maetzuiker</HI> and the Council of <HI>India</HI> say, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> look upon it as the best way of effecting Business, to be just, and endeavor Friendship; which hath been hitherto attested by all People that have dealt with us, either upon the score of Alliance, Commerce, or both: But the way of Traffique is look'd upon as the best Foundation, whence sprouting, it may grow up and branch like a Tree, so to enrich each other in Peace, and assist in all Exigencies of War.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have many years endeavor'd both Traffick and Alli|ance with the <HI>Chineses;</HI> to which purpose the General and Council of <HI>India</HI> ten years since sent their Ambassadors with Presents to the Emperor in <HI>Pe|king,</HI> which were kindly receiv'd, and his Majesty accepted of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> as Friends, and declar'd them so publickly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> have now again by the Lord General and <HI>Indian</HI> Council address'd their Ambassador with Presents to the Emperor, with hearty wish|es, That his Imperial Majesty may live for ever, and that this their desir'd Affinity may last as long as the Sun and Moon endureth.</P>
<P>The Ambassador desires of the Vice-Roy, General, and <HI>Conbon,</HI> That they would assist him in this Negotiation, because their Mediation may facilitate, and so the sooner effect the Business.</P></Q>
<P>This being translated, was, together with a Copy of the <HI>Batavian</HI> Missives to the Emperor, presented unto the General, who after inquiry concerning the brave Horses and Oxen which were to be given to the Emperor, desiring to see them, they fell into other Discourses concerning the Presents, and about land|ing the Merchandise, upon which there had like to have hapned some Con|trast; but the Ambassadors discretion seasonably broke it off, and so depart|ing, went from thence to the Vice-Roy, where they were conducted through another Gate than they went the day before, into the Inner Court, or Privy Chamber, in which the Ambassador, after having shew'd Reverence to the Vice-Roy, was by him bid to sit on his left Hand, on a small Bench, and next him his Prime Officers; to all whom the Vice-Roy seem'd to be somewhat more affable than the General, saying, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were now no Strangers, and that he had been acquainted with them in <HI>Canton,</HI> and done them several good Offices in their Negotiation there; and that he was as rea|dy now to serve them as heretofore, especially because a Person of greater Quality was imploy'd with like Addresses to his Imperial Majesty. Where|upon the Ambassador modestly reply'd, That he had been well inform'd of

his Highness former Affection and Favor to their Nation at <HI>Canton,</HI> and also of the late continuation of the same Civility and Goodness to <HI>Constantine Nobel,</HI> ever since his residing there, for which he return'd him especial Thanks, not doubting but he would keep up his Hospitable Character to Strangers, in as|sisting them in this their present Embassy, in which they desir'd nothing but what was Just and Honorable, and might be beneficial to both Nations: Which he promis'd very seriously, and that he would write in the Ambassadors behalf to all his Correspondents in the Council of State at <HI>Peking:</HI> Then the Vice-Roy inquiring in the same manner as the other did about the Presents and the Lading, the Ambassador fearing that some Contest might arise, as formerly with the General, waved the Dispute, onely replying, That they would be all ready in good Season; but the Merchandise he did not concern himself with: Whereupon the Vice-Roy said, <HI>Well, let it pass;</HI> but desir'd the Ambassador to lend him his Chyrurgeon for a day or two, which he pro|mis'd, when Dinner being upon the Table, breaking off all further Discourse, the Vice-Roy desir'd them to sit at his own Table, on his left Hand, which is there the chief place, where they did eat in the same Dish, and drank in the same Bowl with the Vice-Roy: So having been plentifully treated, they took their leave, and return'd to their Lodging.</P>
<P>At their going away, two <HI>Mandarins</HI> follow'd the Ambassador, telling him, That the Vice-Roy return'd him many Thanks for the Presents which he had sent in the Morning, but durst not receive them as yet; therefore he desir'd him to send for them home till they went to <HI>Peking:</HI> Whereto the Ambassador made Answer, That they were onely a few Trifles for his Children; and de|sir'd that they would please to proffer them once more to his Highness, which they promis'd to do; but however, towards Evening they were return'd again with the same Excuse.</P>
<P>Next Morning, being the twenty seventh, the Ambassador consulted with his Council of what had hapned to him the day before, and ask'd what was further to be done for the advancing of this great Embassy; and also read over the Instructions given him in <HI>Batavia:</HI> after which, having seriously con|sider'd, they unanimously concluded and agree'd, That <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Harthouwer</HI> should that Morning go to the General, to tell his Highness, That the Ambas|sador endeavoring to satisfie him in all Points whatsoever, therefore desir'd that the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> and two Jonks might come up thither with the Merchandise and Presents, and that then he should receive them.</P>
<P>But whilst they were yet busie about this their Resolution, three <HI>Mandarins</HI> came to desire <HI>Nobel</HI> to come to the Vice-Roy, where the General also expect|ed him; thither he and <HI>Harthouwer</HI> went immediately.</P>
<P>At this time the Governor of <HI>Soansifoe</HI> sent the Ambassador as a Present a couple of fat Oxen, besides other good Kitchen Provision.</P>
<P>Mean while <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Harthouwer</HI> came back from the Court, and related, That they still desir'd that the Merchandise and Presents might be brought ashore; which they excus'd, urging the several Inconveniences; but told them that all should be done in good time, when the Presents and Frigats might by unlading be least damnified, concerning which they would come and Treat with his Highness to Morrow.</P>
<P>The twenty eighth in the Morning, about day-light, the Secretary carried the Message to the General, who at his return told, That having staid an Hour ere he was admitted to his Presence, and having complemented his Highness
<PB N="217" REF="127">
in the Ambassadors Name, he answer'd him roughly, saying in a teasty man|ner, That he had spoke with the Ambassador two days since, and granted him as many Jonks as he desir'd, for the unloading of his Goods; and come you now to ask more? Let it be so (said he); I will supply them with Twenties, and if that will not serve, with Hundreds; but in brief, none of their Ships shall come up the River. Tell your Master (continu'd he) that I am a Man that keep my Word, no Promise-breaker; therefore what I grant, they may be as|sur'd of. I know that you are come hither from remote Countreys, through long and turbulent Seas, with Ships freighted with Merchandise; How then should I be so inhumane as not to serve you in what I may towards the ac|complishing of your Desires? But first land your Presents, and when I have seen them, I will write in your behalf to <HI>Peking.</HI> And the more to manifest my good Intentions, and the Love I have for the Ambassador, I will suffer one of his Ships to come up to the Bridge, but accompanied with my Jonks; for which Favor the Secretary return'd him thanks in the Ambassadors Name, promising to give his Master an Account thereof.</P>
<P>The Ambassador order'd <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Harthower</HI> to go to the General so soon as it was possible, and thanking him for his Kindness, further to request a Pass to bring up the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat, and send two <HI>Mandarins</HI> to help them, that all things might be done according to his desire.</P>
<P>The twenty ninth in the Morning the Comptroller <HI>Ruwenoort</HI> went with the Chyrurgeon <HI>Hans Voorechter</HI> to the Court, to carry their Highnesses the follow|ing Letters, and desire their Answers. The first being to the Vice&punc;Roy <HI>Singla|mong,</HI> contain'd, <Q>That the Ambassador had sent his Chyrurgeon to his High|ness Service.</Q> The rest was written to the same purpose with the other three, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That the Ambassador desir'd to know when his Highness pleas'd to accept of a Visit, and treat about the Embassy.</Q></P>
<P>The thirtieth nothing hapned of Remark.</P>
<P>Next Morning two of the Generals Officers came to the Ambassador, and in their Lords Name privately proffer'd him three hundred <HI>Tail</HI> (which they had brought with them) for the Chain of Blood-Corral and Quilt, Goods which he desir'd to be sent; on which the Ambassador smiling, return'd, That he was no Merchant, neither bought nor sold; but if the General would please to accept of those Trifles as a Present, he would take their Reception as a high Honor; and if his Highness hereafter might have a fancy to buy any Goods belonging to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> that their Merchant <HI>Nobel</HI> should furnish him: With which Answers the foremention'd Persons return'd, to give an Account thereof to the General.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon the Vice-Roys Officers return'd with many Thanks to the Ambassador for his Presents, which his Highness had kindly receiv'd, and as a grateful Return, had sent him eight Pieces of <HI>Chinese Brocadoes,</HI> which they desir'd the Ambassador to accept, and he courteously receiv'd, though not va|lued at above eighty <HI>Tail</HI> of Silver.</P>
<P>In the Evening after Prayer the Comptroller <HI>Ruwenoort</HI> deliver'd his first Ac|compt of Charges and Expence, which the Ambassador gave to <HI>Putmans</HI> and the Secretary <HI>Vander Does</HI> to look over, and also to inquire if the Provision should be brought in by greater quantities than they us'd to have it before, it might not be had at a cheaper Rate; thereby to be as saving as they could.</P>
<P>The first and second of <HI>September</HI> nothing hapned worthy recounting.</P>
<P>The third in the Morning the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s Intepreter sent the <HI>Chi|nese</HI>
<PB N="218" REF="128">
<HI>Gienso</HI> to ask the Ambassador when he pleas'd to come to visit his High|ness, and shew him the brave Horses, that he might give his Lord an Account of it; Whereupon he was answer'd, That it was left to the Choice and Plea|sure of his Highness, and that the Ambassador was always ready at his Com|mand.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon two of the Vice-Roys chief Factors came to <HI>Nobel,</HI> and told him, That they had Order from his Highness to ask if the Company de|sir'd to have much White Raw Silk; which if they had, his Highness would endeavor to perswade the General, because the Transportation was strictly forbidden by the Emperor; and that it might be observ'd, five Persons of Qua|lity were sent into every Territory bordering the Sea, from <HI>Peking;</HI> so that it would be very difficult to get their Consents: Therefore they ask'd (a Price never heard of) two hundred and fifty <HI>Tail</HI> for a <HI>Picol,</HI> desiring to have an An|swer upon it immediately, that they might give an Account to his Highness. Whereto <HI>Nobel</HI> made answer, That notwithstanding the time did not permit to send to <HI>Japan,</HI> yet they would exchange those Merchandises which they had brought with them, for a Parcel of Silk, to carry to their Native Countrey; but he would have them to know, not at such Prices; and therefore if they would not come nearer to the matter, he would neither Treat about it, nor make any Proffer, desiring them to be better advis'd: Whereupon they re|ply'd, That they had no other Order, and therefore desir'd the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to consider of it, and so let it rest for that time.</P>
<P>Mean while the General and <HI>Conbon</HI>'s Factors also came thither, but made no mention of the foremention'd Business. The Ambassador to oblige them, and that they might seek to get their Masters to affect the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> invited them to Dinner; which ending, they, after they had been handsomly treated, with kind Thanks took their leaves.</P>
<P>Not long after the General also sent two <HI>Mandarins</HI> to tell the Ambassador, That he had been inform'd how the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in the <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven would not hasten the unlading of the Emperors Presents as they should, because they had onely loaden three Jonks full of Merchandise, and would not make use of the other Jonks, which made their Highnesses doubt (as they said) whether the Ambassador would go up to <HI>Peking,</HI> or not: They had writ to the Emperor of the Ambassadors arrival; but now they must assure him, that they had seen the Presents; therefore they desir'd a second time, that his Excellency would please to send Order to the Ships, with one of their Vessels, that they might immediately go about that Business: On which they were answer'd, That such Orders had already been given, and that their Highnesses need not doubt of the care and diligence that should be us'd in the Embassy; yet however, that he was inclin'd for their satisfaction to send another Letter thither, which they promising to tell the General, took their leave.</P>
<P>The fourth against the Evening four Jonks with Pepper arriv'd at the Bridge at <HI>Lamthay,</HI> which they had taken out of the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> and <HI>Vlaerding</HI> Fri|gats. The Persons that came with them gave an Account, That the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat lay at Anchor between the Tower and the Bridge of <HI>Lamthay,</HI> and hop'd that before the next Morning she would also come up to the Bridge; and like|wise that the <HI>Constance</HI> was come safe into the <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, and that all things were in good Condition with the Ships, which the Ambassador was glad to hear.</P>
<P>The same day two <HI>Mandarins</HI> came to the Ambassador in the Generals name,
<PB N="219" REF="128">
to inquire how many Men there were in the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat? If any Soldiers came in her? And why they brought so many? To which they were answer'd, That there were no Soldiers in her, and but forty seven Men in all, which were requir'd to govern the Ship, and other Employments: Whereupon they return'd.</P>
<P>Mean while two eminent <HI>Mandarins</HI> sent from the General came to look after the unlading of the Goods, for which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> prepar'd Boats and other Vessels. The foremention'd <HI>Mandarins</HI> said also, That if the Ship did not come up to the Bridge that day, they would on the morrow fetch out the Presents with their Barques, and then send her down again to fetch others.</P>
<P>All the Factors belonging to his Highness, except the chiefest, came likewise to tell <HI>Nobel,</HI> That their Masters had agreed to deliver their Silks to the Com|pany; and that it was now time to Trade, because some Commissioners were expected daily from <HI>Peking,</HI> at whose coming there would be no likelihood to transport one <HI>Catty</HI> of Silk: Whereto <HI>Nobel</HI> made answer, That he would wil|lingly deal with them, but he must first see the Silk, and likewise agree about the Merchandise; but if they demanded two hundred and fifty <HI>Tail,</HI> as they had done the third Instant, it would not be worth the speaking of it. They having (as they said) no other Order, departed.</P>
<P>On the twenty ninth of <HI>July</HI> a Fly-boat nam'd the <HI>Poelsnip,</HI> the thirtieth, the <HI>Nieuport</HI> Pink; and the fifth of <HI>August,</HI> the <HI>Overveen,</HI> came thither without their Masts, which they had lost in a Storm about the <HI>Macaw</HI> Islands, and going after|wards to repair their Breaches at the Isle of <HI>Quemuy,</HI> the <HI>Tartar-Chineses</HI> told the Commanders, That the <HI>Coxingan-Chineses</HI> had Besieg'd <HI>Quelang;</HI> and many other things concerning that Isle.</P>
<P>The sixth in the Morning two <HI>Mandarins</HI> came to tell the Ambassador from the General, That the Governor of <HI>Minjazen</HI> had advis'd him&punc; that another <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship had arriv'd in the <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, which made his Highness de|sirous to know what Ship it was, and if it came from <HI>Quelang,</HI> which if it did, it should immediately return.</P>
<P>In answer to which, they were told, That the Occasion of the coming of this Ship would be made known to his Highness by a Letter which was wri|ting.</P>
<P>According to the Resolution taken the last Night, the Secretary went to the Court to deliver the Letter, the Contents whereof were to this effect.</P>
<P><Q>That the Ambassador could not but acquaint their Excellencies, That a small Ship was arriv'd there from <HI>Quelang,</HI> bringing News, That four Months since the <HI>Coxingans</HI> had Besieg'd the Fort there, but were beaten off with great loss: Then he desir'd that he might send the said Ship again to <HI>Quelang</HI> with some Necessaries, as Tar, <HI>Kadjang,</HI> Timber, and the like Necessaries. And lastly, That all diligence was now us'd to get the Emperors Presents ashore, the greatest part of them being already arriv'd at the Bridge in the small <HI>Holland</HI> Vessel; concerning which, or ought else, he would be glad to speak with their Highnesses, when they pleas'd to command him.</Q></P>
<P>The Secretary came first to the General; but he having some <HI>Mandarins</HI> with him, could not in Person grant him Audience, but sent one of his Factors to the Secretary for the Letter, which was given him, and a speedy Answer de|sir'd upon it.</P>
<P>After an hours stay, the foremention'd Factor came to the Secretary, to present him in the Generals Name with a Cup of Bean-broth, and tell him in
<PB N="220" REF="129">
answer to the Letter, That so soon as the <HI>Mandarins</HI> (that were with his High|ness) went away, he would consult on their Request, and acquaintthe Am|bassador with his Resolution by his <HI>Mandarins.</HI></P>
<P>From hence the Secretary went to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong,</HI> where the Let|ter, as at the Generals, was receiv'd by a Servant, under pretence, That the Vice-Roy being indispos'd, could not grant him Audience.</P>
<P>An Hour after, the Interpreter came also to give the Secretary a Cup of Bean-broth, and tell him, That the Vice-Roy had understood the Ambassa|dor's Mind by his Letter, and had granted his Request, nay, would have done it, had it been of greater concernment; but the <HI>Hollanders</HI> must first seek the Generals Consent, which he doubted not but they might easily obtain: Where|upon the Secretary acquainted his Highness with the General's Answer, who said, That it was well, and he would speak with him about it.</P>
<P>His Highness also caus'd him to be ask'd, Why the Horses and Oxen were not brought to his Court, since he had a great fancy to see them? and to de|sire that it might be done about two days after. To which the Secretary re|ply'd, That it was true, they had promis'd his Highness; but he had sent word, That they should refer it till all the Presents were ashore, and that then he would see them together: Whereupon his Highness told them, That the Ge|neral had made that Answer, and not He; and therefore desir'd, as before, to see them, whether the Presents were ashore or not, two days thence: Which the Secretary promis'd to acquaint the Ambassador with; and rising to de|part, two <HI>Mandarins</HI> came from the General, to inform the Vice-Roy of the Ambassadors Request, so that he was commanded to stay a little. The <HI>Manda|rins</HI> going away again, the Vice-Roy sent him word, That the General had un|derstood that those of <HI>Quelang</HI> were by the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> furnish'd with Provisi|ons and Water; but as for the transporting of Timber, Stones, Tiles, and Nails, it could not be granted: However he had prevail'd so much, (alledging that they were but Trifles, which since <HI>Quelang</HI> had been besieg'd, were wanting for the Repairing of the Houses) that by the said <HI>Mandarins</HI> they had in the Ge|nerals Name granted the Ambassadors Request; for which Kindness the Secre|tary humbly thanking his Highness in the Ambassadors Name, took his leave.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon two <HI>Mandarins</HI> came again to the Ambassador, to give him an Answer to his Request which he had made in the Morning, which they deliver'd, after some Complements, in this manner: That the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were Licensed to transport what Provisions they had desir'd, Timber and Nails excepted, to which his Highness could not consent; which contradict|ed that which the Vice-Roys Interpreter had told the Secretary, <HI>viz.</HI> That the General and the Vice-Roy had permitted it: But there were daily Commissio|ners expected from <HI>Peking,</HI> to search those Havens; and that his Highness did not doubt but they would grant it him.</P>
<P>Towards Evening the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat arriv'd at the Bridge of <HI>Lamthay,</HI> with the Presents: The Ambassador also sent a Letter, with the <HI>Constance's</HI> Boat, to the Merchant <HI>David Harthouwer,</HI> informing him, That the four Jonks laden with Pepper out of the <HI>Vlaerding</HI> and <HI>Blyswiik,</HI> arriv'd there yesterday, but were not all weigh'd: The <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat had also been in sight, but durst not come to the Bridge. The Proposal to unlade the <HI>Alphen</HI> into the Fly-boat, was lik'd very well, and that then she might be brought in with care, and more safety; to which purpose they should send the <HI>Polesnip</HI> to <HI>Sothia,</HI> to take in the <HI>Alphens</HI> Goods (so to give little or no suspition to the <HI>Tartars</HI>) and take as much Pepper
<PB N="221" REF="129">
and other Goods out of her, as they could conveniently carry, and then let her come up the River with it, because the fore-mention'd Vessel should in few days go with Provisions to <HI>Quelang.</HI></P>
<P>The Ambassador judg'd it fit, and it would be convenient in that juncture of time, to have a strict Eye upon the Concerns of <HI>Quelang,</HI> and therefore ad|vis'd them to Consult about it; to which purpose <HI>Harthouwer,</HI> Captain <HI>Vander|werf,</HI> with the Commander <HI>de Vlieg,</HI> were sent for to come up in the <HI>Blyswiik,</HI> and likewise Captain <HI>Bitter.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Blyswiik</HI> that Evening came up to the Bridge, and in the Morning in|tended to Unlade her Presents, and two days after (if it were possible) she should be sent to fetch the rest.</P>
<P>The seventh about Sun-rising the Boat set Sail, and Orders was also given for the Unlading of the <HI>Blyswiik.</HI></P>
<P>In the Afternoon a <HI>Mandarin</HI> coming from the General, ask'd the Ambassa|dor if he would send the Provisions to <HI>Quelang</HI> by the <HI>Blyswiik,</HI> because his High|ness had not known that that Ship would have come up so high? On which he was answer'd, That it should be done so soon as the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> had made one Turn more to fetch the remaining Presents.</P>
<P>Towards Evening all the Goods design'd for Presents were Landed out of the <HI>Blyswiik,</HI> but it being too late to bring them into the Merchants Lodge, they were forc'd under good Guards to lie in the Barques all Night: but in the Morning, being the eighth, they were all brought into the Lodge.</P>
<P>The same day <HI>Putmans,</HI> Master of the Ceremonies, and the Comptroller, went with the Horses and Oxen to the Court, to shew them to their Highnes|ses, according to their Request two days since. Coming home again they re|lated, That they had pleas'd their Highnesses exceeding well, and that <HI>Singla|mong,</HI> to whose view they went first, ask'd if they were wild or tame? to which they had answer'd, <HI>Tame:</HI> He had also highly commended the Oxen, and had caus'd them to be carry'd and shewn to his Women, by whom they were beheld with great admiration: his Son had also been Mounted on one of the Horses. After which his Father ask'd concerning the Ambassadors Health; and also desir'd his Chirurgeon might come to him the next day. The Gene|ral had also view'd and lik'd them; asking likewise about the Ambassadors Health, if he had any good Doctors? for if he had not, he would send his; and why the <HI>Hollanders</HI> sent down the Boat without leave, since he never had refus'd to grant them any of their Requests? and withal when the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat went again to fetch the rest of the Presents? Whereupon Captain <HI>Putmans</HI> reply'd, That the Ambassador was pretty well recover'd, and he knew not any thing to the contrary but that he had a good Doctor; yet humbly thank'd his High|ness in the Ambassadors behalf for his kind Proffer: why the Boat went down without leave he could not give any account; but as to the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat, she was now Unlading her Pepper, and would at farthest be gone again within two days.</P>
<P>The Commander of the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat complain'd to <HI>Nobel,</HI> that the <HI>Tar|tars</HI> hinder'd him in the Unlading of the Pepper, he having call'd two Barque|men aboard, which accordingly came; but the <HI>Tartars</HI> seeing them took them, notwithstanding he interceded for them, and said that he was the occasion of their coming, and caus'd them to be carry'd to Prison in Fetters, which made <HI>Nobel</HI> send <HI>Ienko</HI> to complain to the Commission'd <HI>Mandarins</HI> about it.</P>
<P>Mean while a Factor was sent to <HI>Nobel</HI> from the General, to enquire about
<PB N="222" REF="130">
the Ambassadors Health, and if he had any good Physicians, because his High|ness would else send him his.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon the Interpreter <HI>Ienko</HI> came with some <HI>Mandarins</HI> and Mer|chants to the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat, to redeem the Prisoners, and give order for the Unlading of her, which was begun immediately.</P>
<P>Next Morning, being the ninth, the Ambassador sent to the Vice-Roy <HI>Sing|lamong,</HI> to excuse him, that he could not accommodate him with his Chirurge|on, because he also was indispos'd, but so soon as he amended he should be immediately sent to him.</P>
<P>In the interim the <HI>Tyger</HI> Sloop arriv'd there with a Letter from the Mer|chant <HI>David Harthouwer;</HI> in which the Ambassador was inform'd, that with the other Officers he had thought it convenient not to let the Ship <HI>Alphen</HI> come into <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, because it was too dangerous to come thither against Wind and Tyde: which Resolution they acquainted the Commander of her with, that when he thought convenient he might remove from <HI>Sothia</HI> to <HI>Tinhay;</HI> who had sent an Answer, That he would observe it, and consider with his Officers about it, and then send his approbation.</P>
<P>The fifteen Chests brought hither by the <HI>Polesnip,</HI> were put into the <HI>Constance,</HI> and in the room of them they had Laden her full of Pepper out of the <HI>Constance</HI> and <HI>Tyger,</HI> which weighed forty nine thousand six hundred sixty eight <HI>Catties;</HI> by which means the Ships had made so much room, that they could not conve|niently come at all the Goods design'd for Presents, so that they onely waited for the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> to Ship them in her.</P>
<P>The <HI>Polesnip</HI> Fly-boat was now ready to come up, if they had leave and a Pass for her; but the <HI>Povi's</HI> Commissioners would not permit it without Or|ders from above.</P>
<P>The <HI>Vlaerding</HI> had on the sixth instant Unladen thirty two thousand one hundred forty five <HI>Catty</HI> of Pepper into a <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonk, which lay there still; so that at last with great trouble they got to the <HI>Sandal</HI> Wood that was to be Pre|sented.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon two Merchants were sent from the General, to enquire af|ter the Ambassador's health; which Visit he order'd his Comptroller to re|quite, by giving them six Hens, five Gammons of Bacon, some Pomegranates, Chesnuts, and Pears.</P>
<P>The same day the Ambassador desir'd the General, that he might have the use of his Doctor but for a Day, because he was much troubled with Gripes in his Bowels; upon which Request he came immediately and prescribed him something, which he had no sooner taken, but found present ease.</P>
<P>The tenth in the Morning the Doctor came again to give the Ambassador some more Physick. A Factor came also to enquire of his health, and if the Medicines the Doctor had given had done him any good) to which he was answer'd, Yes, and that the Ambassador had found great ease by it, desiring the Factor to thank his Highness in his behalf; which he promis'd to do.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bliswyk</HI> and the <HI>Tigers</HI> Sloop were put off from going that day, and or|der'd to stay till the next, because some <HI>Mandarins</HI> scrupled the carrying away of so much Provision; about which they would first speak with the General.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon two <HI>Mandarins</HI> came into the Lodge with a Pass for the <HI>Bliswyk</HI> Frigat, and the <HI>Tygers</HI> Sloop; and said also, That they were sent to Sail down with the Frigat.</P>
<P>The eleventh the Frigat and Sloop set Sail to <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven.</P>

<P><PB REF="132">
<PB N="223" REF="132">On Sunday Noon, being the twelfth, two Factors came to the Lodge, to present the Ambassador in the Generals Name with some <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg"><HI>Chinese</HI> Suckets.</NOTE> <HI>Connemomy,</HI> and to tell him, That the Ambassador had been a considerable time ashore, and that the Emperors Presents were not yet Landed: then the Ambassador desir'd that his Highness would please to give order that they might be suddenly de|liver'd, because he much longed to see them; nor that they could proceed in any Trade before the Goods were ashore, and likewise that then preparations should be made for his Journey to <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>Whereupon the Ambassador sent this Answer, That the rest of the Presents would suddenly be ashore, and that he thank'd his Highness for his <HI>Connemomy,</HI> and in requital of it desir'd him to take a few Conserves of Nuts, Cloves, and the like: So having been well entertain'd by the Ambassador, the Factors took their Leave.</P>
<P>In the Evening it was consider'd, That for several Reasons which the Governors had alledg'd by their Factors, it might happen, so soon as news came from <HI>Peking</HI> for the Ambassador to take his Journey thither, that their Highnesses might press his going, and that they (nothing being as yet in readiness, and all in a hurry) might be put to a great inconvenience; There|fore the Ambassador, to begin betimes, proposed, If it would not be ne|cessary to acquaint their Highness's to morrow, That most of the Pre|sents were ashore, and the rest expected in few days; if therefore they might begin to Pack them, and cause Chests to be made for them; of what big|ness the Chests must be, and how many Men must carry them, and also the Sad|dles and Furniture for the Horses; and likewise if their Highnesses would please to send Commissioners before the Presents? if the <HI>Sandal</HI> Wood, being very big, could be carry'd by Land as it was, or in what Pieces it ought to be cut? that they must also carry several other Goods with them to <HI>Peking</HI> to give to the Council of State, and other eminent Persons; if they saw it conve|nient, to desire their Highnesses to accept of the last Presents, being onely Trifles, sent to them by the Ambassador, because they had no Place in the Lodge to keep them; If their Highnesses should chance to speak of Trading, to press it forward, and to order that two Ships might about two Moneths hence be sent to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Holland,</HI> to give an account of the Ambassador's Proceedings, and the like.</P>
<P>This the Ambassador and his Council agreed upon, and <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Putmans</HI> order'd to go and acquaint their Highnesses with it.</P>
<P>The thirteenth in the Morning <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Putmans</HI> (according to the Resolu|tion taken the Night before) went to the Court to speak with their Highnesses. About Noon coming home again they related, That they had not seen them, it being their Full-Moon, and <HI>Singlamong</HI> indispos'd; yet they had sent their Bu|siness to them by their Interpreters, and receiv'd in answer, That when all the Presents were brought ashore, their Highnesses must be inform'd of it, and that then they would send their Commissioners, to see and be present at the Packing of them; The Chests might be made for them, and about the bigness to contain a hundred <HI>Catty</HI> weight; The <HI>Sandal</HI> Wood must not be cut, but sent as it came from the Lord General <HI>Maetzuiker;</HI> The other Goods which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> would carry with them to give away when an occasion did present, should be set down with the Chests and Packs, that they might know exactly how many Porters they should want.</P>
<P>The fore-mention'd Trifles they could not receive before all the Emperor's
<PB N="224" REF="133">
Presents were brought up. Because they did not speak with their High|nesses themselves, they had not made any mention of the Business concerning Trade.</P>
<P>The fourteenth about Noon the <HI>Vlaerdings</HI> Sloop arriv'd there from <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, with <HI>Harthouwer</HI> and Captain <HI>Vander Werf,</HI> who related, That all things as well in <HI>Sothia</HI> as <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, were in good condition at their departure from thence, and that all the rest of the Presents were taken out of the <HI>Constance</HI> and <HI>Tyger,</HI> and put into the <HI>Bliswyk</HI> Frigat.</P>
<P>The fifteenth the <HI>Bliswyk</HI> arriv'd there with the rest of the Presents, and al|so the Jonks with three hundred forty four Bags of Pepper out of the <HI>Vlaer|ding.</HI> In the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat also came Captain <HI>de Bittor,</HI> who had been Gover|nor in <HI>Quelang.</HI></P>
<P>A general report also went, that nine <HI>English</HI> Ships were on the Coast of <HI>Chi|na,</HI> about the Isles <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy,</HI> and that they had been in <HI>Canton,</HI> and desir'd to Trade there; but the <HI>Tartar-Chineses,</HI> not willing to take four hundred Tail for the granting of them their Trade, were sent away from thence, and were now come afresh to prosecute their old Design.</P>
<P>The Governor having sent word to the Ambassador by <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Putmans</HI> on the thirteenth instant, That so soon as the Presents were all Landed, he should inform them of it; therefore he judg'd it convenient to advise their Highnesses of the arrival of the remaining Presents in a Letter by the Secretary, that if they pleas'd (about two days hence, when they were sorted) they might come and see them in Person, or send their Commissioners, that they might make fit preparations for them.</P>
<P>The sixteenth in the Morning the Secretary went first to the General, to de|liver him the following Letter in the Ambassadors Name, that the rest of the Presents were now come ashore, and that the next day they would all be put in order; therefore if his Highness pleas'd to come in Person, the Am|bassador would most kindly entertain him; or else send his Commissioners to see them.</P>
<P>In like manner he desir'd a Pass for the Boat, that she might go up and down without being stopp'd to enquire the certainty of the News concerning the <HI>English</HI> Ships.</P>
<P>No sooner was the Secretary's coming made known to the General, but he sent for the Letter, and an hour after gave this Answer; That it was not cu|stomary for the General to come in Person to see the Goods, but he would send his Interpreter if the Presents were as the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had reported them, and then consult whom he should send: as to what concern'd the Boat, he would send a Pass for her by his <HI>Mandarins.</HI></P>
<P>The rumor was at Court, that the General intended that Afternoon to see the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ship; to which purpose several Flags, Halberds, and the like, were stuck in the Street.</P>
<P>From thence the Secretary went to the Vice-Roy's Court, where after some stay he was brought into the Presence in a back Hall. His Highness having ask'd concerning the Ambassador's health, and the Secretary given him a re|spective Answer, deliver'd his Highness the Ambassador's Letter, advising him that all the Presents were now Landed, and if his Highness pleas'd, to send Commissioners to see them. Whereupon his Highness made Answer, That he was glad to hear that the Presents were all safe ashore, and that he would not fail to send his Commissioners the next day to see them: And after having
<PB N="225" REF="133">
drunk to him in a Cup of Bean-broth, and entertain'd some frivolous Dis|courses within, the Vice-Roy gave him leave to depart.</P>
<P>Mean while the General's Interpreter came with some Factors into the Lodge, to bring an Answer on the Letter that was brought in the Morning to his Court, which was after this manner: <Q>That a Pass should be brought for the Boat the next Morning; but when she had made one Voyage, that they should always bring the Pass to his Highness again, and at her depar|ture ask for a new one.</Q> Moreover the Interpreter said, That the General was not well pleas'd that the Ambassador should desire him to come and see the Presents in his own Person; yet the Interpreter had appeas'd and satisfi'd him.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Ambassador answer'd the Interpreter, That by the Discourse of the People he had heard that the General would come himself to see the Presents, and therefore had written, that he should esteem himself happy if it might be so; but had he known, that either the Vice-Roy or General would have been angry, he should not have done it. With which Answer the Inter|preter took his leave.</P>
<P>The remaining Presents were this day all brought out of the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat into the Lodge.</P>
<P>The seventeenth in the Morning the same Interpreter that had been there the day before came to the Lodge, to ask if the Presents were Landed; on which he was answer'd Yes, and that they were brought thither the last Night, and they onely stay'd till the <HI>Mandarin</HI> saw them.</P>
<P>At Noon an eminent <HI>Mandarin</HI> came to tell the Ambassador from the Gene|ral, That his Highness had heard that all the Emperor's Presents were going to be brought to his Court, therefore ask'd him how many <HI>Coelis,</HI> which are Porters, could carry them: Whereupon the Ambassador answer'd, That he knew nothing of it; and withall, that the bringing of them to the General's Court could not well be done, because of the bigness of the Packs of <HI>Sandal</HI> Wood, and other things: but if his Highness desir'd it, he entreated him to send a written Order by his <HI>Mandarins,</HI> they being not his, but the Emperor's Presents, and also that he would not bear the blame if any of the Goods should chance to be damnifi'd by their Carriage thither. Which Discourse prevail'd so much, that the <HI>Mandarin</HI> said, His Highness should onely send for a Piece of each sort to see them. To which the Ambassador answer'd, That all which his Highness should give order for in Writing he would obey. Hereupon the <HI>Mandarin</HI> rising up reply'd, That his Highness should send a written Order.</P>
<P>The eighteenth in the Morning, another Factor came into the Lodge, sent from the Vice-Roy, to ask concerning the Ambassador's health: and amongst other Discourses <HI>Nobel</HI> ask'd him what they should do concerning Trade? all the Presents were now ashore, and the time come which their Highnesses had limited: To which the Factor answer'd, That it would be convenient to send a Letter to <HI>Singlamong</HI> about it, and therein express, That his Highness had for three years together given them leave to Trade, and that he would also be pleased to do it now, and assist them in it; and that <HI>Nobel</HI> might be admit|ted to speak with him more at large about it; so made no question but all things would fall out according to his desire. He ask'd moreover if the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> would sell the two hundred Bags of Pepper lying in the Storehouse to him. To which <HI>Nobel</HI> answer'd, Yes, if they could agree. Mean while two <HI>Manda|rins</HI> came into the Merchants Lodgings from the General, telling them that all the Cloths, Perpetuana's, Crown-Serges, and other Goods belonging to the
<PB N="226" REF="134">
Emperor's Presents, should on the morrow (if the Weather permitted) by an Order from the Governors be fetch'd to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong's</HI> Palace, where all the great Persons would be ready to see them; the Chests to fetch the Presents in were making ready, and as for the bulky Packs that were not so curious, they should not trouble themselves.</P>
<P>The foremention'd <HI>Mandarins</HI> were also impower'd by the General (as they said) to search the <HI>Holland</HI> Ships, if there were no more Pepper, or other Mer|chandise in them, desiring that two of the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> would please to go along with them, who at their Return related that all things were according to the Cargo.</P>
<P>Since now, according to the Governors desires, the Emperor's Presents were brought ashore, and they had promis'd that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> should begin to Trade, of which as yet they saw no likelihood, therefore Captain <HI>Nobel</HI> was on <HI>Sunday</HI> the nineteenth sent with the following Letters from the Ambassador to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> and General, being to this purpose, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>That the Vice-Roy had known the <HI>Hollanders</HI> several years, and always shewed them respect and favor, and assisted them in obtaining Dispatches in their Affairs. The <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Captain <HI>Nobel.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Houpou</HI> understood the last year from the Vice-Roy and <HI>Lipovi,</HI> That an Ambassador must of necessity address himself to the Em|peror this very year, whereupon they should immediately drive their Trade; which the <HI>Houpou</HI> gave account of to the General in <HI>Batavia;</HI> who thereup|on hath sent a Person of Honor, one of his Council as Ambassador, and brought the Emperor's Presents ashore upon your Highnesses desire, and promise, that so soon as that should be done they would begin to Traffick; therefore the <HI>Houpou</HI> humbly desires, that his Highness would be pleas'd to permit it, and give order to the Factors and Merchants about it, that the <HI>Houpou</HI> may be the sooner ready to go with the Ambassador to <HI>Peking,</HI> and the rather, because that two Moneths after the Date thereof, two Ships must go to <HI>Batavia;</HI> by which the Ambassador must give an account to the Gene|ral there, and also to the Province of <HI>Holland,</HI> of his success in that Empire. The <HI>Houpou</HI> was very desirous to send some Goods with those two Ships, which he would buy of the Factors; therefore he humbly requested that the Trade might now commence.</Q></P>
<P>To which <HI>Nobel</HI> receiv'd an Answer from <HI>Singlamong,</HI> That he wonder'd at the <HI>Hollanders</HI> hastiness, since the Ambassador was not to travel up to <HI>Peking</HI> till the new Year, and that an Answer was expected from thence in twenty days; therefore they must stay till that time, because the Cargo that they had brought (which in respect of what the <HI>Hollanders</HI> carry'd into the Empire of <HI>Iapan</HI> was very small) could be sold in five days; and that the forementi|on'd Ships might then go away time enough. However, his Highness by <HI>No|bel's</HI> perswasions granted that they might conclude with the Factors about the Prices for the Goods which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> intended to Vend there, and for those which they should receive in Barter for them, and drive their Trade privately, without publishing it before Orders came from <HI>Peking,</HI> because he knew not but that the Emperor might desire all, or a part of their Commodities.</P>
<P>The General <HI>Siangpovi,</HI> to seem resolute and bountiful, promis'd to <HI>Nobel,</HI> That so soon as he had seen the Presents, he would send his Factors to the Lodge to agree with him concerning his Merchandise, provided the <HI>Hollanders</HI> ask'd modestly, and not more than the value for them. He also boasted much of his good inclination towards the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> because he had lent them his
<PB N="227" REF="134">
Jonks to bring their Merchandise ashore, of which they had lost nothing; and that he resolv'd from that time forward to continue his kindness, and endea|vor by all means possible to advance them. About the sending of the two Ships for <HI>Batavia</HI> he seem'd somewhat backward, because according to his judgment nothing of consequence could be advis'd by them: but being some|what better inform'd about it, made answer, That the first Orders were expe|cted from the Emperor in fifteen days, therefore would have them stay till then. Their Highnesses also ask'd courteously concerning the Ambassadors Health; and hearing of his Recovery, seem'd much to rejoyce at it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mandarin Han lavja</HI> came also to the Lodge to tell the Ambassador, that the General had order'd him to go along with his Excellency as Guide to <HI>Peking,</HI> and that four Standards must be made to be carry'd before the Ambas|sador in his Journey, out of which two must be mark'd with <HI>Dutch,</HI> and two with <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters; and moreover, that he had been inform'd the Gover|nors in few days would grant the Trade.</P>
<P>The one and twentieth and two and twentieth nothing hapned worthy of note.</P>
<P>The twenty fourth in the Morning, a <HI>Mandarin</HI> came to the Lodge, asking if the Ambassador did not know when the <HI>Chineses</HI> that came from <HI>Batavia</HI> went away? and from what Place? if they were first carry'd over with the <HI>Holland</HI> Ships? and what was their native Countrey and Names?</P>
<P>The <HI>Mandarin</HI> receiv'd in answer, That some went over the last year as Ser|vants with <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Pedel</HI> to <HI>Batavia;</HI> and as to what concern'd the rest, they came thither from <HI>Canton, Tayowan, Chinkfieuw, Hoksieu,</HI> and other Places, both in Ships and Jonks, but the Places of their Birth and Names were unknown to him, because he had never enquir'd after them. They desir'd at <HI>Batavia</HI> to be Transported to their native Countrey again, which was accordingly grant|ed them.</P>
<P>The same <HI>Mandarin</HI> had a Letter given him, in which a Pass was desir'd from the General, for the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat to carry down some Goods that were to be sent to <HI>Quelang,</HI> and come up again with Merchandise; and likewise from the <HI>Vlaerding</HI> Sloop.</P>
<P>The twenty fifth about Noon a <HI>Mandarin</HI> brought a Pass for the fore|mention'd Ship and Boat to go up and down the River.</P>
<P>The twenty sixth in the Morning the Comptroller made several Com|plaints to the Ambassador, That the <HI>Chineses</HI> at the buying of the Necessaries for <HI>Quelang</HI> (appointed by the General) had prevented the Person, who daily brought him Flesh, Fish, Herbs, and the like, into the Lodge, from bringing any more as he us'd to do, and had complain'd of him, and made him so odi|ous to the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> that they had put him and the <HI>Coelies</HI> Master (which had assisted the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> in buying of Provisions for their Ships) into Irons; by which means the <HI>Coelies,</HI> and other labouring People that work'd in the Lodge, durst not come any more thither, which put the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to a great inconvenience.</P>
<P>There also came an eminent <HI>Mandarin</HI> to the Lodge, to give order for the Pressing of Jonks at <HI>Minjazen,</HI> to fetch the Merchandises out of the Ships.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon, it being fair Weather, the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat went away with the Necessaries that were to be sent to <HI>Quelang,</HI> and also for fresh Provisions for the Ships in <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven.</P>
<P>In the same Frigat Captain <HI>Vander Werf,</HI> and <HI>Vander Does</HI> the Secretary,
<PB N="228" REF="135">
went down to take an account of those <HI>Chinese</HI> Goods which came over in the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships from <HI>Batavia,</HI> and seize on all their Moneys and Merchandise of any value, because on the two and twentieth the Ambassador had found in one of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Chests to the value of a thousand Rix-Dollers in Money, con|sisting in <HI>Spanish</HI> Dollers and <HI>Iapan</HI> Boat-Silver, which was strictly forbidden in <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>The Merchants <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Harthouwer</HI> went in the Afternoon by the Vice-Roy, General, and <HI>Conbon's</HI> direction, to Treat about the Trade. When among other things <HI>Harthouwer</HI> and <HI>Nobel</HI> proposed, That upon Sale they must fetch the Pepper and <HI>Sandal</HI> Wood out of the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ships in the Haven; which the Factors refus'd, saying, That the Goods should be deliver'd to them in the Ambassador's Lodge. But at last they agreed, That the Goods being fetch'd out of the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ships, and brought up the River in Jonks by the Gene|ral's Order, were to be deliver'd on the Shore, on the hither side of the Bridge, after the same manner as in former years. Then they desir'd the particular Parcels of the Merchandise brought thither by the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> and how ma|ny, and what Goods they would have in Return of them; which they writ down accordingly in their Notes, as <HI>China Root,</HI> ordinary <HI>Tee, Galya,</HI> Allom, Preserv'd Ginger, <HI>Hatten,</HI> Gold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Seeing the great quantity of Allom and Gold Wyer, besides Gold which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> desir'd, they seem'd to be much amaz'd, and judg'd, that the two first sorts could never be afforded for the Prizes that were set down for them by the <HI>Netherlanders;</HI> and demanded, why the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had not ask'd for Silk: To which they were answer'd, That it could not be done before the Prizes were setled on the <HI>Dutch</HI> Commodities, and that then an account might be made of their Stock; which they seeming to approve of, soon after departed.</P>
<P>The twenty eight in the Morning, two of the General <HI>Povi</HI>'s Factors came into the Lodge, of which, one being <HI>Povi</HI>'s Intimate, went with the Interpre|ter <HI>Apari</HI> to the Ambassador, and desir'd him to give him some account of what he had yesterday written to <HI>Povi:</HI> Whereupon his Excellency made an|swer, That amongst other things, he would willingly speak with <HI>Povi</HI> con|cerning the Trade, and also his going up to <HI>Peking:</HI> To which he reply'd, That he being his Favorite, could do much in it; but he would advise to pre|sent him with some more Blood Coral, which he dust assure would not be lost, and that about two days after, the Ambassador might come to visit <HI>Lipovi,</HI> be|cause that and the next were kept as Fast-Days of the first Moon. The Am|bassador hereupon answer'd, That he depended upon the Noble and Heroick Disposition of the General, and therefore desir'd his Highness to repose Con|fidence in him, as being a Person of so clear a Spirit, as would endeavor to re|taliate the General's Favors. So the Factor being Presented with ten Yards of Red Cloth, and Vowing to serve the Ambassador to the utmost of his Power, took his leave and departed.</P>
<P>The twenty ninth in the Morning, <HI>Putmans</HI> went with the Interpreter <HI>Ienko</HI> to the General, to inquire if he was any ways busie, because that was the appointed time for the Ambassador to visit him: Whereupon they were answer'd, That the General was always imploy'd, but that the Ambassador might come when he pleas'd; which they at their return acquainting his Excellency, he instantly went to Court, and Presented some Blood Coral to the General. Whereupon his Highness told him, That he well knew the generous Nature of the Ambassa|dor: Who reply'd, That he esteem'd the Favors and kind Receptions which
<PB N="229" REF="135">
he had receiv'd from the General, that he was oblig'd to study Requital.</P>
<P>Then the Ambassador desir'd to know the time, when, and which way he should go to <HI>Peking.</HI> Whereto he answer'd, That it was now the ninth Moon, and that he might set forward on his Journey very suddenly.</P>
<P>Next, the Ambassador desir'd that they might begin to open Trade, that the <HI>Houpou</HI> (meaning <HI>Nobel</HI>) might be ready to go along with him. To which was answer'd, That the Presents must first be view'd, and that the <HI>Mandarins</HI> there|to imploy'd, had been four days busie about their Orders, which was now done, and the Presents should be look'd over in two or three days, and then the Trade should Commence. Their Discourse ended, after a handsome Treat, the Ambassador went very well satisfi'd to his Lodgings.</P>
<P>Coming to the Lodge, they were soon after visited by the Generals intimate Factor, to tell them, that the General had consider'd about the Coral Chain, and durst not accept of it; yet at length through his perswasions, and that it came from the Ambassadors own Hand, he had taken it. The Factor likewise desir'd a great Blood Coral, which was given him, in hopes that he might assist them in their Trade.</P>
<P>The thirtieth in the Morning, the Ambassador sent a Letter by <HI>Putmans,</HI> and the Interpreter <HI>Ienko,</HI> to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> to this purpose.</P>
<Q><P>THe Ambassador had long since heard, and now understood, that <HI>Singla|mong</HI> had a kindness for the <HI>Hollanders;</HI> therefore he hop'd, that he would please to assist him in all things hereafter, which would be no small Ob|ligation only to himself, but also to his Masters, and desir'd to visit his High|ness, to speak with him about the Journey to <HI>Peking.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Against Noon, <HI>Putmans</HI> came again to the Lodge, relating, That he could not speak with the Vice-Roy, but after delivery of the Letter receiv'd answer, That he should be busie four or five days, so that he could not give the Ambassador Audience, and that nothing could be said about the Journey to <HI>Peking,</HI> till the Presents were look'd over, which would be done in few days; with which answer <HI>Putmans</HI> took his leave.</P>
<P>Against the Evening, the General <HI>Povi</HI>'s Interpreter came to the Lodge to tell the Ambassador from his Master, that when the Presents were view'd, (which should be done in a day or two,) he would desire the Ambassador to be free as he would be to him, and to ask freely for what ever he wanted, who gave the Interpreter five Yards of Red Cloth for his Message.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>October</HI> in the afternoon, the <HI>Mandarin Liu-lavja</HI> came with Orders<NOTE PLACE="marg">October.</NOTE> from the General, to fetch all the <HI>Chineses</HI> from the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships with their Goods; and to that purpose desir'd a Note to the Commanders of them, to which he was answer'd, that the <HI>Netherland</HI> Secretary was gone thither to search their Goods, which <HI>Liu-lavja</HI> desir'd might be brought into the Lodge; whereupon the Ambassador gave the <HI>Mandarin</HI> two Letters, one to Captain <HI>Vander Werf,</HI> and one to the Secretary <HI>Vander Does,</HI> advising them, that the <HI>Chi|neses</HI> might be deliver'd, provided they had been search'd and examin'd before by the Secretary, who if he found any thing of concern, should according to his last Letter, secure it aboard till further Order, with which the <HI>Mandarin</HI> departed.</P>
<P>The second and third being <HI>Sunday</HI> and <HI>Monday</HI> nothing happen'd of note.</P>
<P>The fourth, the Ambassador had Audience granted him by the Vice-Roy, who after Salutations, complain'd, that he was indispos'd, having great pains in his Head and Back.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="136">The Ambassador first thanking him for the Honor he receiv'd by his pre|sence; then desir'd to know the time when, and what way he should travel to <HI>Peking:</HI> To which his Highness answer'd, That if news came from <HI>Peking</HI> that day, he might go on the morrow; whereupon the Ambassador desir'd that the Trade might Commence, that <HI>Nobel</HI> and he might be in a readiness: To which the Vice-Roy answer'd, That the Ambassador need not to trouble himself about the Trade, because the sale of all the Goods they had brought might be dispatch'd in four or five days; but they must first Pack up all the Emperors Presents, and bring them to the Royal House, and that day on which they were brought they might begin their Trade on the next. On this the Am|bassador reply'd, He would depend on his Highness's Royal Word, and there|fore would not trouble him any farther, but that he would give Order, that the Presents should with all speed be brought into his Palace.</P>
<P>Then the Ambassador's Son presented him for his Daughters a great and small Chain of Blood Coral, which he accepted; yet said, he durst not receive, but that they were a Present from the Ambassador's Son, for his Children; and though himself was much indispos'd, yet he desir'd, that the Ambassador would stay and refresh himself a little; which being perform'd, after Dinner, just at his Departure, the Vice-Roy's Daughters, as a thankful return for the Coral, Presented the Ambassadors Son with six Rolls of Silk Stuffs.</P>
<P>Coming to the Lodge, the Ambassador gave Order for the making of sixteen Cases against the next day, to Pack the Presents in, and carry them to <HI>Singla|mong</HI>'s Palace. Soon after, <HI>Liv-lavja</HI> came to visit the Lord <HI>Van Hoorn,</HI> telling him, that he should go with him to <HI>Peking,</HI> but the time when, was yet unknown.</P>
<P>The fifteenth in the Morning, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">The Ambassador.</NOTE> his Lordship sent a Letter by the Inter|preter <HI>Ienko</HI> to the <HI>Conbon,</HI> advising him:</P>
<Q><P>THat he knew very well the good Inclination which he bore to his Countrey-men, and also that he had always assisted them, which they would ever acknowledge with much Thankfulness, in regard the <HI>Conbon</HI> had for some time been very busie, that he could not have the Honor to speak with him; now he desir'd, that he might come to proffer his Service to him.</P></Q>
<P>The Interpreter for all this civility, after their Proud manner, brought on|ly in return, an excuse of indisposition, and that in three or four days he might give him a visit.</P>
<P>The sixth in the Evening, <HI>Ienko</HI> the Interpreter came to tell the Ambassa|dor, that the <HI>Mandarin Liv-lavja</HI> was come with all the <HI>Chineses</HI> from the Ships up to <HI>Lamthay</HI> Bridg, and desir'd to know why he had detain'd some of their Goods; On which the Ambassador answer'd, that he had express Order from the General and Council of <HI>India,</HI> that he should do it, because the <HI>Chineses</HI> de|sir'd that they might be only brought over with their Necessaries; therefore, if either Money or Merchandize was found by them, it was forfeited, as it was likewise with his own Men: Whereupon he reply'd, That the General resen|ted, and that the <HI>Mandarin Liv-lavja</HI> would speak with the Ambassador about it the next day.</P>
<P><HI>Nobel</HI> also inform'd the Ambassador, that the Factor had told him that very day, that he had privately been inform'd, that they would have suddenly news from <HI>Peking;</HI> and also that the Ambassador should not go thither him|self, but that the Presents should be sent thither, and that he should stay in
<PB N="231" REF="136">
<HI>Hoksieu,</HI> to Treat with the Governors about the Trade, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> look'd upon as a Discourse without Truth or Reason.</P>
<P>The seventh and eighth, nothing happen'd of remark, but only some false rumors that troubled the Ambassador, that the Emperor had order'd the Pre|sents to be brought to <HI>Peking,</HI> and he to stay at <HI>Hoksieu;</HI> and on the other side, <HI>Singlamong</HI> was as much concern'd at the seizure of the <HI>Chineses</HI> Money, which was forfeited according to the <HI>Maritime</HI> Law.</P>
<P>The ninth about Noon, they receiv'd an account, that all things remain'd in a good condition at <HI>Tinghay,</HI> and <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, only some new Dis|putes with the <HI>Mandarins</HI> and Messages concerning the <HI>Chineses</HI> forfeited Goods, which were for the most part Silver, Camphire, Coral, and Seed-Pearl.</P>
<P>The tenth, the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat arriv'd at <HI>Lamthay</HI> Bridge, laden with Pepper, taken out of another Vessel, and also the remaining Necessaries for the Ambas|sador and his Retinue, likewise some Packs for his private occasions. The <HI>Mandarins</HI> (which as Commissioners) had been down with the Frigat, and re|turn'd in her, coming to the Lodge, were by the Ambassador presented with as much Cloth, as would make each of them an upper Garment.</P>
<P>The eleventh, it was resolv'd in Council, to unlade the <HI>Tyger</HI> and <HI>Constance</HI> with the first, and send them to <HI>Tinghay,</HI> there to make themselves ready to go for <HI>Batavia,</HI> at the latter end of the Moneth.</P>
<P><HI>Lapora</HI> the Factor inform'd the Ambassador, that the next day the Presents would be brought to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s, there to be view'd; in order to which all things were prepar'd.</P>
<P>The twelfth in the Morning, about Day light, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> prepar'd all the Presents in a fit manner to be carry'd to Court, expecting the <HI>Mandarins;</HI> but in stead of them, the Factor <HI>Lapora</HI> brought what they little expected, that they should not bring the Presents to Court, till further Order; by which Di|latoriness, he perceiv'd, that they were not willing as yet, to suffer them to open and vend their <HI>Cargo:</HI> Therefore he propos'd to his Council, If it would not be convenient, for these Delays that he should shew his Dislike by Letter; and withal desir'd, that he might return aboard, until they had liber|ty to Vend their Goods, or receiv'd Orders for their Journey to <HI>Peking,</HI> which they approv'd.</P>
<P>But next Day, while he was preparing the Letter, <HI>Lapora</HI> coming to the Lodge, he told him what he was about to Write, and resolv'd to send immediately; who desir'd him by all means to forbear two or three days longer, to which he was perswaded, which fell out the better; for the next Morning he sent for the Presents.</P>
<P>At this time, the Ambassador heard there were many Vessels making ready at <HI>Lamthay</HI> Bridge, whereby he judg'd, that they were preparing, that when ty|dings came for him to come to <HI>Peking,</HI> then they might hurry him away upon a sudden, which made him ask what Vessels they were, and who was to go with them? To which the Interpreter reply'd, That they were in few days to go with some <HI>Tartar</HI> Lords, and perhaps with the Ambassador to <HI>Peking;</HI> for which, and that he might be the freer hereafter to acquaint him with the like, he made a Present of five Yards of Red Cloth.</P>
<P>The fourteenth, in the Forenoon, the Emperor's Presents were carry'd to the Vice-Roy's Court, accompany'd with the Ambassador, <HI>Nobel, Harthouwer, Putmans,</HI> the Secretary, and the whole Train, the Presents being carry'd before, were follow'd by the Ambassador and his Retinue; who coming to the Pa|lace
<PB N="232" REF="137">
were brought to the Common-Hall, to stay there while the General's coming, at last they were call'd into the Presence Chamber, where the Vice-Roy and General sate on Stools one by another, and next them on their left Hands, three Commissioners sent from <HI>Peking,</HI> to inquire what <HI>Chineses</HI> had car|ry'd themselves valiantly at the Conquering of <HI>Eymuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy;</HI> which also after the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were enter'd, took their leave, being Conducted by the Vice-Roy to the Stairs descending into the Court, by which they suppos'd them to be great Lords: The Ambassador was also desir'd to sit down on a low Stool at the Vice-Roy's right Hand, and his Attendants in order next him; opposite to them sate the <HI>Poetzjensy,</HI> the Magistrates of the City and other great <HI>Mandarins;</HI> the Chests with the Presents standing just without in a Gallery. When the Vice-Roy began with their usual Complement to inquire of his Health, afterwards the Chests and Packs with the Presents being open'd, the Goods were taken out in several Parcels, brought and laid before their High|nesses to see them; seeming to be well pleas'd with them, especially some cu|rious Lanthorns, and Celestial and Terrestrial Spheres and Globes: Having sa|tisfi'd their longings, and pleas'd their curiosity with viewing and re-viewing, they commanded them to be laid up handsomly, and in good order again: Which done, after some familiar Discourses, they Treated them very pleasant|ly with store of good Liquor; when on a sudden the General went away, being Complemented by the Vice-Roy to the middle of the Stairs descending into the Court. But the Vice-Roy returning again into the Hall, gave leave to the <HI>Ne|therlanders</HI> to depart; whereupon they also went away: At their going out, <HI>No|bel</HI> was desir'd by <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s Factor, that he and <HI>Harthouwer</HI> would be pleas'd to come to his House, that they might Treat with him concerning the Trade, which they promis'd to do. The Ambassador having sent a Rundlet of Sack to the Vice-Roy, desir'd him to accept of it, which he did, and return'd him Thanks.</P>
<P>According to the Factors Request to <HI>Nobel</HI> the day before, he and <HI>Harthou|wer</HI> went the fifteenth in the Morning to his House, to Discourse with him about the Trade: Soon after their coming, the Factor Rode to <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s Palace; from whence he in an hours time return'd again, but could not come to any absolute Resolution, onely telling them, that he had a Parcel of Silk of about forty <HI>Pikol,</HI> which he would willingly sell: Who said, That it might be done, but that he would consider, that they could not send any Silk to <HI>Ia|pan</HI> that Year, but that they must first carry it from thence to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and then send it to <HI>Iapan</HI> the next Year, so that they should run a great Risk in sending of it to and fro; yet nevertheless, if they would deal reasonably, they would take a considerable quantity; asking the Price, which the Factor durst not tell, because the Generals and <HI>Conbon</HI>'s Factors were not there present, but pro|mis'd to consult about it, and let them know their resolution on the Morrow, when they would come to the Lodge, and let them know the Prizes of all their Goods, and so begin to Trade.</P>
<P>He also advis'd the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants, that they should go to the General, or to his Factors, and give him an account of what they had done, which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> did not think convenient, because they had not been with the Vice-Roy, but went to his Factors, who also promis'd to come to them on the Morrow, desiring that they would also acquaint the <HI>Conbon</HI>'s Factor with it, which was perform'd accordingly.</P>
<P><PB N="233" REF="137">The Ambassador by the Interpreter <HI>De Hase,</HI> sent the General a small Rund|let of Sack, which he kindly receiv'd.</P>
<P>Then calling to mind, that the <HI>Conbon</HI> was not at the looking over of the Presents, and also having understood that he was not well pleas'd, the Am|bassador sending for his Factor, desir'd to know the reason: To which they reply'd, That the occasion was, because his Presents which were deliver'd on <HI>August</HI> 26. were much less than the Vice-Roy's or General's, which he took ve|ry ill, being as great a Lord as <HI>Povi.</HI> The Ambassador somewhat troubled at this Relation, intreated his Factors to desire their Lord that he would please to admit, that he might wait upon him, and endeavor to give satisfaction; with which they promis'd to acquaint him, and bring an answer the next Morning, as he did, letting the Ambassador know he might come to his Ma|ster two days after.</P>
<P>The Interpreter <HI>Maurice</HI> having again been with <HI>Sibontok,</HI> to present him with three Swords in the Ambassadors Name, which receiving with Thanks, he promis'd to do the <HI>Hollanders</HI> what Service he could; and withal, gave no|tice, that having Dined the day before at the Generals, He there understood of some <HI>Mandarins,</HI> that the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were in ten or twelve days to travel to <HI>Peking,</HI> and that he had receiv'd his Commands to go before, and to wait for the Ambassador at <HI>Iemping,</HI> being his Dominion through which they were to pass. He therefore desir'd, that the Ambassador would please to bring with him some Coral, Amber, Sword-Blades, Pistols, Musquets, Cloth, Perpetuanaes, Linnen, Looking-Glasses, some Gold Rings, and Sparks or Pebbles, which he had an intent and desire to buy of him.</P>
<P>All the Governors Factors, except <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s chiefest, came that day to the Lodge to give the Prizes of their Commodities, and endeavor to make a Bar|gain. <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Harthouwer</HI> gave them account of these Merchandizes, <HI>viz.</HI> Pep|per, <HI>Sandal-Wood, Arek,</HI> Cloves, Nutmegs, Lead, Tin, <HI>Calicutor-Wood,,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Commodities which the Factors gave the <HI>Dutch</HI> an account of, consisted in Gold Wyer, <HI>China</HI> Root, course <HI>Tee, Galiga,</HI> Allom, Quicksilver, <HI>Cubebs,</HI> Pre|serv'd Ginger, <HI>Hatten,</HI> Gold: As for raw Silk, one of <HI>Povi</HI>'s Factors said, that the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> could carry none from thence that year.</P>
<P>Not long after, the Stewards appear'd with a Pass for the <HI>Constance</HI> Boat, and the <HI>Vlaerdings</HI> Ship, which set Sail at high Water, Laden with Provisions to the Ships in <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven.</P>
<P>The eighteenth, the Ambassador went to visit the <HI>Conbon,</HI> where he was no|bly entertain'd; and after Dinner, the Cups merrily went round, Health pres|sing Health, so long, till both sides began to yield to the Intoxicating Liquor.</P>
<P>The nineteenth about Noon, two Factors sent from the General, came to the Lodge to present the Ambassador in their Masters Name with six Pots of Liquor, in requital for the Rundlet of Sack, which they said was very accep|table to him.</P>
<P>The Ambassador asking them if they knew not whether any News was come from <HI>Peking:</HI> They reply'd, That they knew of none, but that it was expected there in five days time.</P>
<P>The twentieth in the Morning, the Governors Factors came a second time to <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Harthouwer,</HI> to agree about the Price of the Goods, but parted with|out coming to a Conclusion.</P>
<P>In the Evening, a Sea-man came ashore from <HI>Minjazen</HI> without the <HI>Tartars</HI> knowledge, with a Letter sent from Captain <HI>Naelhout,</HI> who inform'd the <HI>Ne|therlanders,</HI>
<PB N="234" REF="138">
That yesterday he was coming up in the <HI>Vlaerdings</HI> Sloop, but was stopt at <HI>Minjazen,</HI> which necessitated him to go again to the Ships, and had in the Night undertaken the Journey anew, hoping in the Dark to have pass'd by <HI>Minjazen;</HI> but that also fell out contrary to his expectation, because the <HI>Chineses</HI> that kept the Watch in a Jonk that lay in the middle of the Water, had perceiv'd and kept them there; so that they were detain'd at <HI>Minjazen,</HI> therefore desir'd a Pass from the Ambassador to come to him, without which they saw no likelyhood of getting thither.</P>
<P>The Mariner further related, That all things about the Ships were in a good condition, onely the <HI>Tygers</HI> Men going ashore in the <HI>Crab-Hole,</HI> to cut Wood, one of them was suddenly seiz'd on, and devour'd by a <HI>Tyger.</HI></P>
<P>The Ambassador causing the Interpreter <HI>Ienko</HI> to be call'd, commanded him to go betimes the next Morning to the Governor of <HI>Minjazen</HI>'s Lodgings (who was yet there) to ask him why he detain'd his People at <HI>Minjazen?</HI> And desire him, to give Order, that his Men might pass; which if he refus'd, the Ambas|sador must be forc'd to complain to the General about it.</P>
<P>The one and twentieth in the Morning, the Interpreter <HI>Ienko</HI> brought an|swer, That the Governor of <HI>Minjazen</HI> was gone thither the last Night. The Ambassador considering that the time appointed for the Ships setting forth to <HI>Batavia</HI> began to approach, thought fit the next day to send a Letter about it to the General; and also to desire a Pass for a Boat to go up and down the River, that they might hear daily from the Ships, which then much concern'd the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P>The two and twentieth, the Ambassador went to visit <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s Son, and present him with two Pieces of Black Crown Serge, four of fine Stuffs, four of Linnen; one Piece of Amber, weighing one Pound and an half, half a dozen of Sword Blades; one Pair of Pistols, and a Fire-Lock, the Stock In-laid with Silver. All which he receiv'd very courteously, and Entertain'd the Am|bassador after a Princely manner.</P>
<P>Mean while, the Secretary <HI>Vander Does</HI> went according to the Resolution ta|ken the day before, to deliver him the following Letter, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>It is very acceptable to the Ambassador to understand, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> should by him be esteem'd as Children and Friends of one Family, of which the Ambassador did not doubt, because <HI>Talavja</HI>'s Word (from whom he had it) was like a Rock, never to be mov'd; therefore he desir'd that the little <HI>Holland</HI> Vessel might be deliver'd here, and sent down, because a Ship must be sent to <HI>Batavia</HI> in eight days. He also requested, that his small Boat may come up again; and to that purpose, that he might have a Pass, as in former Years.</Q></P>
<P>To which the Secretary brought answer: That after he had made his co|ming known to the General, he staid three or four Hours upon promise of Ad|mission; yet at last the Interpreter came to tell him, that <HI>Talavja</HI> was so extra|ordinary busie, that he could not give him Audience; and therefore if his bu|siness was such that he could not send his Message, he must come some other time: Whereupon, the Secretary not being willing to loose his labor, gave the Letter to the Interpreter, to deliver to the General, and desir'd him to tell <HI>Talavja,</HI> that the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> at that time wanted a Pass, more than ordinary, for the free going up and down of their Boats.</P>
<P>To which the Interpreter brought answer from <HI>Talavja,</HI> That he had read and understood the Letter, but that some days since he had given a Pass for
<PB N="235" REF="138">
the Boat and Sloop; which the Secretary answering said, That it was true, but that Pass mention'd nothing, but to go from thence down the River, but not that they might come up again; which appear'd by one of them who was returning to <HI>Hoksieu</HI> with the Commander of the Ship Riding at <HI>Tinghay,</HI> and was stopt at <HI>Minjazen;</HI> and withal told him, That if the Ambassador had a Pass for a Vessel to go and return, he must not deliver it but on an extraor|dinary occasion.</P>
<P>The Interpreter having related this to the General, his Highness sent word to the Secretary, that he would send for the <HI>Mandarin Liu-lavja,</HI> and by him send the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> such a Pass as they had the last year, with which they might go and come when they pleas'd.</P>
<P>The twenty third, nothing happen'd worthy relating.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday,</HI> being the twenty fourth, because the promis'd Pass was not come to the Comptroller, <HI>Ruwenoort</HI> and Interpreter <HI>De Hase,</HI> were sent to the <HI>Mandarin Liv-lavja,</HI> to see if he had it ready, and if not, to repair to the General for it. These coming to the <HI>Mandarins</HI> House, not finding him at home, went to the General, and let him know the occasion of their coming; Who sent them answer, That they should go to the <HI>Mandarin Liv-lavja,</HI> he having Or|ders to give out the Passes: To whom making application, the <HI>Mandarin</HI> told them, That he would come to the Lodge, and bring them a Pass for a Boat to Sail up and down the River; but when they intended to send any Provi|sions down, they should onely send him word by their Stewards, and he would grant them a particular Pass for that purpose. The General also sent back his Interpreter with the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> to tell the Ambassador, that no Ships might go to <HI>Batavia,</HI> before they heard from <HI>Peking.</HI> But to this they answer'd nothing, as knowing, that the General could not prevent the going away of their Ships, but that they were highly prejudic'd by not having a Pass, they being desirous to know the condition of their Ships every day; and that he would please to make <HI>Talavja</HI> sensible of the injury he should suffer by it.</P>
<P>The twenty fifth in the Morning, <HI>Liu-lavja</HI> and <HI>Haykong</HI> came to the Lodge, bringing with them a Pass for a small Vessel or Boat to go and come empty, up and down the River, which they gave to the Ambassador, saying, That when a Vessel had been down, and up again, they must return the Pass to <HI>Liv-lavja,</HI> till another went away, and that then they need only to fetch it again, which the Ambassador promis'd to do.</P>
<P>About Noon, the Factor <HI>Lapora</HI> came with a <HI>Tartar</HI> to the Lodge, to acquaint the Ambassador, that a small Letter was come thither from <HI>Peking,</HI> and that his Excellency might now prepare himself for his Journey; because upon the coming of the Emperor's Letter he would immediately be sent away, and the Trade should Commence.</P>
<P>The six and twentieth in the Morning, the Secretary went to <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s Court, to request him, If <HI>Nobel</HI> might be permitted to speak with his High|ness about some business of great Concern: He was also Order'd as he past by to go to the <HI>Conbon,</HI> and to Present him with some Elephants Teeth in the Am|bassador's Name; Who refusing them, said, He durst not as yet receive them, but he humbly thank'd the Ambassador for his kindness.</P>
<P>At the Secretaries coming to the Court, he was inform'd, That the Vice-Roy was gone to the Generals, so that he return'd home without effect.</P>
<P>The twenty seventh in the Morning, the Secretary went again to the Vice-Roy, to intreat his Highness, that <HI>Nobel</HI> might come to visit him; whereof
<PB N="236" REF="139">
being told by the Interpreter, he sent word, that being troubled with Gripes, he could not grant him Audience; and also that he should be busie for four or five days about extraordinary Occasions, and therefore could not let the <HI>Hou|pou</HI> come to speak with him; but so soon as the News came from <HI>Peking,</HI> which was daily expected, the Vice-Roy would so order his Affairs, that the <HI>Houpou</HI> might come and see him when he pleas'd. The Secretary was also command|ed to call on the <HI>Mandarin Liu-lavja,</HI> for a Pass for the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> to carry down Provisions for the Ships: To which <HI>Liu-lavja</HI> made answer, That he could give Passes for small Vessels to carry Provisions to the Fleet, but not for so great a Ship; yet he would go to the General to procure a Pass for her, which if he could get, he would send it by a <HI>Mandarin</HI> that should go down with the Frigat on the morrow following.</P>
<P>The twenty ninth in the Morning the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s Chief Coun|sellor came to the Lodge, with three other great Lords, to see the Horses and Oxen, which they were much pleas'd with, and were entertain'd very nobly by the <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P>In the afternoon arriv'd the <HI>Vlaerding</HI> and <HI>Blyswiik's</HI> Sloops, from <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, with Captain <HI>Iohn Naelhout,</HI> informing them, That all things were in safety and good condition, both in <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, and at <HI>Tinghay.</HI></P>
<P>The thirtieth, because the promis'd Pass for the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> did not come, <HI>Nobel</HI> went to the General to desire it, and also to give Order for the making a Ship ready to sail to <HI>Batavia</HI> (which ought to have been gone fourteen days before) that so soon as News came from <HI>Peking,</HI> she might set Sail, alledging, it requir'd two or three Weeks before she would be fit to go to Sea. He went likewise to the <HI>Mandarin Liu-lavja,</HI> to shew him the Pass which was brought back by the Sloop, according as they had promis'd him, and to desire it again, because another Boat was to be sent down the next morning.</P>
<P>But <HI>Nobel</HI> could not come to speak with the General, being very busie about other Occasions; but was inform'd, That the <HI>Mandarin Liu-lavja</HI> had Order to prepare the Passes: Whereupon <HI>Nobel</HI> going to the <HI>Mandarin,</HI> was told, That the Pass for the Ships had been writ some days, and was at the Generals to be Sign'd, which he would not fail to bring as soon as done.</P>
<P>The one and thirtieth, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> the Ambassador sent <HI>Ienko</HI> once more to desire the Pass for the Ships from the General, but could not come to speak with him, which made him go to <HI>Liu-lavja,</HI> who had promis'd to bring it.</P>
<P>The Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong's</HI> Factor came the same day to tell <HI>Nobel,</HI> That his Highness for some days had been very busie, which had prevented him from granting Audience; but now being somewhat better at leisure, he de|sir'd, That if he had any thing to request, he would come to him.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>November</HI> in the Morning <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s chief Factor sent a Messen|ger<NOTE PLACE="marg">November.</NOTE> to <HI>Nobel,</HI> that according to the appointment made the day before he might come to Court, where he was expected; whereupon he immediately went thither, with Captain <HI>Naelhout,</HI> that according to the Ambassadors Order they might acquaint his Highness, First, That they were inform'd no Silk could be transported from thence that Year; and also, that others, on the contrary, said, That the Factors should not Trade with the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> unless they would take their Raw Silks at high Rates against the <HI>Dutch</HI> Commodities: Besides, that he understood, that the Ambassador upon the receipt of the Em|peror's expected Letter, should immediately begin his Journey; and that therefore he must be in a readiness, which was impossible to be done, because
<PB N="237" REF="139">
<HI>Nobel,</HI> who necessarily must go up to <HI>Peking</HI> with him, must first be there pre|sent at the driving and finishing of the Trade; besides, that in the four fol|lowing Months the River could not be Navigated, because of the Ice. Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Four Months the River <HI>Hoksieu</HI> in <HI>China</HI> not navi|gable.</NOTE> to desire his Highness, That he would be pleas'd to assist the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in the Trade, that so the Ships might be sent to their respective Places; the more, because two of them must on necessity go to <HI>Holland.</HI> After which, the Vice-Roy ask'd concerning the Ambassadors Health, and then answer'd, That the Emperor was very glad that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> came to Trade in his Domini|ons: As to what concern'd Silk, it was forbid to be transported; but if the Factors could agree with the <HI>Hollanders</HI> for a Price that might be to their satis|faction, they would allow the Transportation of it. He wish'd also, That the Prices of their several Commodities might be speedily agreed on. Here|upon <HI>Nobel</HI> (in regard the Factors seem'd so shie in bidding a good Price, told the Vice-Roy, That if he had brought too much Pepper or Sandal-Wood thi|ther, they might onely take as much as they wanted, and that he would carry the rest away again; adding moreover, That it was but reason the <HI>Hollanders</HI> should sell for advantage now, in regard of the vast Expence of their present Embassy. This was immediately answer'd by his Highness, saying, That they might be supply'd by him, as he had done in <HI>Canton</HI> to former Embassadors. Concerning the Ambassadors Journey to <HI>Peking,</HI> which will be in the approach|ing Winter, he ought to furnish himself with good Furr'd Clothes; and where they could not go by Water, they should have Horses and <HI>Palakins</HI> to travel by Land: And that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> ought rather to bring more of their Commodi|ties thither, than carry any away from thence. Whereupon <HI>Nobel</HI> presented his Highness, in the Ambassadors Name, with the Chain of Blood-Corral, which he so long desir'd, and accepted with many Thanks: Then taking his leave, he was conducted into another Chamber, and treated very nobly with variety of Dainties.</P>
<P>In the afternoon the Steward <HI>Onquemoy</HI> came to the Lodge to acquaint the Ambassador, That the Pass was brought for the Ship to go down with the Provisions; but that the Governor of <HI>Minjazen</HI> had it, to whom it must have been deliver'd at its passing by <HI>Minjazen:</HI> Whereupon the Ambassador sent the Interpreter <HI>De Hase</HI> to the foremention'd Governor, to ask if any thing was specifi'd in the Pass, for a Boat to come up again, to bring News from the Ships: To which the Interpreter <HI>Hase</HI> at his Return brought this Answer, That he could not speak with the Governor himself, but his Secretary had told him, That the Pass made mention of nothing else, but to let the Ship and Sloop go down, but not come up again.</P>
<P>The Ambassador not satisfied with such an answer, the next morning sent the Secretary <HI>Vander Does</HI> to know the Contents of the Pass; but not being permitted to speak with the Governor, he onely brought back word, That the Pass contain'd no more than what was told the Interpreter the day before; and therefore if the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> desir'd another Pass, they must go to the Ge|neral for it. Whereupon the Secretary was immediately sent to the <HI>Mandarin Liulavja,</HI> to desire the standing Pass which he had promis'd to make, for the Boat to go up and down the River, and send it together with that for the Ship; and withal tell him, how necessary it was for them constantly to know the Condition of their Ships and People: But the Secretary coming thither, and being inform'd that he was gone to the Lodge, return'd home.</P>
<P>In the afternoon the foremention'd <HI>Mandarin</HI> came with the desir'd Pass,
<PB N="238" REF="140">
drawn after the same manner as the former had been; but a while after the Interpreter <HI>Ienko,</HI> sent from <HI>Liu-lavja,</HI> came to fetch the Pass again, under pre|tence that a Name was forgotten, which must needs be put into it, promising to return it immediately.</P>
<P>The same day the Factors came to the <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants Lodgings, to con|clude an Agreement about the Prises of their Merchandise; but parted again, without making an end.</P>
<P>In the evening the Ambassador sending for the Interpreter <HI>Ienko,</HI> shew'd himself much dissatisfi'd that he did not return the Pass for the Vessels to go to and again, he having promis'd, That so soon as a Name was put in, it should be re-deliver'd: To which he answer'd, That <HI>Liu-lavja</HI> had command|ed him to ask for it, because the <HI>Mandarins</HI> Name which was to go down with it, was to be inserted; and why it was not brought again, he knew not.</P>
<P>The same day Captain <HI>Iohn vander Werf</HI> set Sail in the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> to <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, where by the Ambassadors Election he was to bear the chief Com|mand, and observe all Transactions, and keep things in good order.</P>
<P>The Treasurer acquainted the Ambassador, That the fifty <HI>Picol</HI> of <HI>Kadjang,</HI> and twenty Gammons of Bacon, were not yet brought for the Ships, because the Steward had told him, That there was an Order that no <HI>Kadjang</HI> nor Gam|mons of Bacon might be transported: Whereby the Ambassador seeing, that seldom any Provision was sent to the Ships without the greatest trouble ima|ginable, judg'd it convenient to write a Letter to the General, to this purpose.</P>
<Q>That the Ambassador had always found <HI>Talavja</HI> kind and affable, and therefore thank'd him: That he likewise knew that he had much Business, wherefore he would not be troublesom to him: That the <HI>Holland</HI> Sea-men must in this <HI>Mouson</HI> be provided for with Meat and Drink, or else they could not live: That the Ambassador had continually been put to much trouble to get fresh Provisions; therefore he desir'd, that the Husband-men might every eight days carry Porkers, and the like fresh Provisions, with their own Vessels, and sell them to the Ships, which would save both him and <HI>Talavja</HI> a great deal of trouble.</Q>
<P>This Letter <HI>Nobel</HI> and the Secretary <HI>Vander Does</HI> carried to Court, to deliver it to the General; but coming to the City Gates, they were stopp'd by the Watch, who said, That Order was come from the General, not to let any <HI>Hol|landers</HI> into the Town; whereupon they resolv'd to return, which the Guards seeing, call'd them back, and suffer'd them to pass to the Generals, whither coming, they sent him word of their being there, for which he sent to know the Reason; whereupon they deliver'd the Ambassadors Letter to his Inter|preter, who brought them this answer, That <HI>Talavja</HI> was very busie, and could not grant them Audience; but that he permitted the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> to carry as much Provision out as they pleas'd, first giving an account of it to the <HI>Manda|rin Liu-lavja,</HI> that the General might afterwards sign it&punc; But he did not under|stand that any Person should buy all manner of Goods, and carry them aboard, without being willing that the Waiters should perform their Office, in search|ing the Ship, whereby they should give an account of what they transported; and likewise, that they must use their own, and not <HI>Chinese</HI> Vessels.</P>
<P>Mean while the Interpreter <HI>Ienko</HI> brought back the Pass for the Sloop to go up and down the River. The <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat, the Water being somewhat faln, stuck about a Cannon-shot from the Bridge, where she was forc'd to stay till High-water.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="140">The fourth there was nothing done, but a Dispute concerning the Waiters stopping the Frigat, and clapping her aboard with four or five of their best Jonks, and that some <HI>Mandarins</HI> desir'd she might be brought back to the Bridge.</P>
<P>The next day all the Governors Factors came to the Lodge, but went away again without speaking any thing concerning the Trade.</P>
<P>In the evening the <HI>Vlaerding</HI> Sloop arriv'd there again from <HI>Netherland</HI> Ha|ven, with a Letter from Captain <HI>Iohn Vander Werf,</HI> where he found the <HI>Pole|snip</HI> that came from <HI>Quelang</HI> riding at an Anchor; wherefore he thought it con|venient to send his Book-keeper thither, to acquaint his Excellency with it by a Letter, and to advise him, That all things about the Ships were in good con|dition, and also that they had not seen any Ships either going to or coming from <HI>Iapan.</HI></P>
<P>The fifth in the Morning the Ambassador sent the Interpreter <HI>Ienko</HI> to the General, to acquaint him with the Fly-boats arrival, and also to desire that <HI>Nobel</HI> might come and speak with him. The Interpreter returning with two <HI>Mandarins,</HI> told the Ambassador, That the General was so busie about some private Concerns of the Empire, that he could not give any publick Audience. Mean while a Ship did afterwards come thither from <HI>Quelang,</HI> which the General had privately permitted to go away again with Provisions and other Necessaries; but she was now return'd, which his Highness did not under|stand, and therefore the Ambassador must give immediate Order for her to be gone. Hereupon the Ambassador answer'd the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> That it should be done; and desir'd them to bring a Pass for the Sloop to go to and fro to carry Tydings, which they promis'd without fail to perform.</P>
<P>The sixth, a Servant bringing a Pass from the <HI>Mandarin Liu-lavja,</HI> for a Ves|sel to carry Provisions to and again, said, That the Sloop must at farthest go away the next Morning.</P>
<P>The seventh against noon, with the Ebb, the <HI>Vlaerdings</HI> Sloop went down with certain Writings, kept by <HI>Caroli</HI> their Clerk and <HI>Maurice</HI> the Interpreter; but they return'd again, telling, That the Governor of <HI>Minjazen</HI> would not suffer any fresh Provisions, as Hogs and Fruitage, to be carried down; whereupon the Ambassador commanded them to take nothing but the Papers and Writings.</P>
<P>The tenth in the morning <HI>Ienko</HI> the Interpreter related, That a <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonk sent from <HI>Batavia</HI> to <HI>Hoksieu</HI> with Pepper and <HI>Sandal</HI>-wood, was forc'd (not being able for contrary Winds to reach her desir'd Port) to put into <HI>Huiting,</HI> there being about forty <HI>Chineses</HI> in her: The Master of her coming by Land, had been in <HI>Hoksieu</HI> to attend the General, but was return'd with his Letters, without effecting any of his propos'd Designs.</P>
<P>In the afternoon a Clerk belonging to the <HI>Conbon</HI>'s Secretary came to bring the <HI>Hollanders</HI> a Copy of what had been done concerning their Business in <HI>Pe|king,</HI> and also said, That a Currier was come before with Letters, and that in a few days the express Orders would be there; which News he supposing would be very acceptable to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> he had endeavor'd to be the first Person that should bring it. The Ambassador gave little credit to this Report, by reason of the meanness of the Person that brought it; but told him, If his News were true, he would remember him with a Present, which he suppos'd he wanted.</P>
<P>In the evening the <HI>Conbon</HI>'s Factor came, confirming the News which the Poor Man brought in the morning, and wish'd the Ambassador Joy in his Ma|sters
<PB N="240" REF="141">
Name with the Good Tydings: Whereupon the Ambassador immediate|ly sent to the <HI>Mandarin Liu-lavja</HI> for a Pass for the <HI>Blyswiiks</HI> Sloop, that she might go and see if the Fly-boat which was order'd to stay at <HI>Tinghay</HI> till the twelfth Instant, could yet be found to carry this News to <HI>Batavia:</HI> To which purpose he immediately wrote a Letter, inclosing the Copy which came from <HI>Peking,</HI> to be Translated at <HI>Batavia,</HI> he having no time to do it himself: But the desir'd Pass came not.</P>
<P>The twelfth in the Morning the Ambassador sent the <HI>Blyswiik's</HI> Sloop down with the foremention'd Letter, to which he added the Reason why he could not send before. Mean while all the Governor's Factors came to wish the Am|bassador Joy with the Good Tydings he had receiv'd from <HI>Peking,</HI> moreover desiring, that they might have leave to Trade with the first.</P>
<P>It was also reported, That Commissioners were come to Complement the <HI>Liquean</HI> Agents, and Present them in the Emperor's Name, because it was not thought convenient to let him come to <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>In the Afternoon the <HI>Vlaerding's</HI> Boat, with the <HI>Blyswiik's</HI> Sloop, return'd, coming too late to overtake the <HI>Polesnip,</HI> she having set Sail for <HI>Batavia</HI> that morning.</P>
<P>In the evening the Interpreter <HI>Ienko</HI> told <HI>Nobel,</HI> That he was order'd the next Morning to go to the Commissioners that were come from <HI>Peking</HI> to Comple|ment the <HI>Liquean</HI> Agents; but what it was for, he knew not.</P>
<P>The thirteenth the Ambassador sent <HI>Ienko</HI> to the <HI>Mandarin Liu-lavja,</HI> to know the Reason why no Provision might be sent down in the Boat: In Answer to which, he brought word, That <HI>Liu-lavja</HI> promis'd on the morrow to go to the General in their behalf.</P>
<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> in the evening, being the fourteenth, <HI>Ienko</HI> inform'd <HI>Nobel,</HI> That the General had sent for him to go to the Commissioners about the <HI>Liquean</HI> Busi|ness, because he had not been there the day before, according to their Request: But now going thither, the Commissioners ask'd him if the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had no Blood-Corral, little Dogs, and other Trifles to sell: To which <HI>Ienko</HI> had re|ply'd, That he knew not; but was sure they had Pepper, <HI>Sandal</HI>-Wood, Cloth, Crown-Serge, and other such like Commodities.</P>
<P>The fifteenth against Noon, <HI>Singlamong's</HI> Interpreter came to the Ambassa|dors Lodging, who ask'd him concerning the News that on the eleventh Instant came thither from <HI>Peking,</HI> and what the Vice-Roy thought of it; but he seem'd to be ignorant thereof, which made the Ambassador shew him the Letter, and ask him a second time whither it was true or not, desiring him to take the Co|py, and shew it to the Vice-Roy.</P>
<P>And because the Pass for the Boat to carry down Fresh Provisions was not yet brought, and that the Steward which furnish'd the <HI>Hollanders</HI> with all such Necessaries, had so often deceiv'd them by delays; therefore it was judg'd fit to send a Letter to the General, and therein advise him what trouble they had continually before they could get any Provision sent down.</P>
<P>The seventeenth in the morning the <HI>Mandarin Han-lavja</HI> came to visit the Am|bassador, who among other Discourse ask'd him, If when he desir'd to speak with the General, he must send notice into the City? To which he reply'd, That such was <HI>Talavja</HI> his Order.</P>
<P>Against Noon the Pass was brought for the Boat, so that the Provisions were immediately put aboard, That she might be ready to go off at High Water.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="141">The Ambassador wrote a Letter with the Provision to Captain <HI>Vander Werf,</HI> advising him of the whole Intrigues of that Place: Notwithstanding all which, in the Evening <HI>Stulburgh</HI> and <HI>Smitsen</HI> came to tell them, That the <HI>Chi|neses</HI> would not let the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">A kind of Corn.</NOTE> <HI>Kadjang</HI> pass, saying, It must first be grown'd, before the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> should transport it; supposing, since they carried such great Quantities out, that they might sowe it in some other place: Whereupon al|though the Ambassador himself went to the Steward <HI>Onquemoy,</HI> yet he prevail'd no more, but that the <HI>Kadjang</HI> was weigh'd, and ten <HI>Picol</HI> sent aboard, with some other Provision for the Ships.</P>
<P>The same day the Commissioner sent from <HI>Peking</HI> to meet the <HI>Liquean</HI> Agents, came to the Lodge to see the Horses and Oxen, whom the <HI>Hollanders</HI> civilly entertain'd.</P>
<P>The eighteenth in the morning <HI>Hanlavja</HI> the <HI>Mandarin</HI> came to acquaint the Ambassador, That the General would speak with him as soon as he pleas'd, and that he might bring the Presents.</P>
<P>In the afternoon the General sent the Ambassador two Letters written from the Emperor at <HI>Peking,</HI> concerning his Business; which having perus'd, they consulted about the delivery of the Presents.</P>
<P>It was judg'd fit, that those intended for the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong,</HI> should be deliver'd to him first, he being the Chief in Quality: Upon which Result, the Ambassador immediately sent Factor <HI>Lapra</HI> thither, to complement his High|ness, and deliver him the Presents sent from <HI>Batavia:</HI> But the Vice-Roy being busied about entertaining the Emperors Commissioner, nothing for the present was done in it.</P>
<P>The nineteenth in the forenoon the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> preparing themselves, first went to the General with his Presents, where coming, and being seated as for|merly, after complemental Salutes, the Ambassador thank'd him for his kind Writing in the <HI>Hollanders</HI> behalf to <HI>Peking,</HI> and told him, that they had brought the Presents along with them, sent to his Highness from the Lord General and <HI>Indian</HI> Council, which they entreated him to accept: But <HI>Siangpovi</HI> refu|sing, said, That till such time as the Emperor had his, and they were return'd from <HI>Peking,</HI> he could not receive them; but advis'd the Ambassador to have all things in a readiness for his Repair to <HI>Peking,</HI> which he believ'd would be within ten or twelve days. Whereupon the Ambassador desir'd, That in re|gard of the present Winter, and for that the Trade was not finish'd, it might be put off till <HI>February.</HI> To which <HI>Talavja</HI> answer'd, That in the Journey the Emperor's Orders must be follow'd and observ'd in all Points, and that the Ambassador ought to have all things in readiness: As to what concern'd the Trade, he would be assistant to him, that it might speedily be finish'd: And notwithstanding it was a Custom, that the Ambassadors must first deliver their Presents, before they were permitted to Trade; yet because the <HI>Holland|ers</HI> were come from such remote Countreys, and also that they might the bet|ter defray their Expences, he granted them to Trade before they went. Then after a handsom Treat, with many thanks to his Highness for his Kindness to|wards them, they return'd to the Lodge.</P>
<P>The twentieth about day-break the <HI>Vlaerding's</HI> Boat arriv'd there from <HI>Nether|land</HI> Haven, with the Commanders <HI>Hendrick Bommer</HI> and <HI>Peter Iohnz de Vlieg:</HI> The Pilots Mate also deliver'd a Letter to the Ambassador from Captain <HI>Vander Werf,</HI> advising him, That he had receiv'd all the Provisions sent with the Boat in safety; but he doubted that they lay in some danger, because several Jonks
<PB N="242" REF="142">
of War came daily Cruising there, and several Guards were plac'd between the <HI>Straits</HI> of <HI>Minjazen,</HI> and more Guns planted every where.</P>
<P>The same day, according to Order, the Lord <HI>Hoorn</HI> went with the Presents to <HI>Singlamong's</HI> Palace; where coming, and some Complements pass'd, the Am|bassador requested his Highness to accept of what he had brought; to which he answer'd, That since the Business went well at <HI>Peking,</HI> he kindly accepted of them, and order'd them to be deliver'd to him. Then he ask'd <HI>Nobel,</HI> who was there present, if he had not put them in the right way, when he told them, That if they sent an Ambassador to the Emperor, they could not miss their Desires? and that for the future they might rely on his Judgment. The Am|bassador asking his Highness how he would please to Order his Journey, and when it would be? reply'd, That the Letter from the <HI>Hopous</HI> and <HI>Pingtouws</HI> was expected there in five or six days, to provide <HI>Coelies,</HI> which are Porters, Vessels, and other Necessaries for his accommodation, and that then he should know exactly when he was to set forth. After the Presents were open'd be|fore him, and he seeming to be well pleas'd with them, he ask'd the Ambassa|dor, spying some rich Furrs amongst the Goods, if there was cold Weather in his Countrey? who answer'd <HI>Yes;</HI> and pointing at the Furrs, said he should Clothe himself well with them. After a sleight Caress the <HI>Hollanders</HI> desir'd leave to depart, which was granted them, his Highness excusing himself, that because of his Distemper he could not be present to Entertain the Ambassador, who with all his Attendants went again to the Lodge.</P>
<P>The one and twentieth the <HI>Conbon's</HI> Factor came to tell the Ambassador, That if he pleas'd, he might that day come and speak with his Master: whereup|on the Ambassador laying hold of the opportunity, went immediately thither; coming to his Palace, and the first Ceremonies pass'd, the Ambassador desir'd him to accept the Presents, which with much perswasions and many arguments he did. Then the Ambassador desir'd him, that since he had always assisted the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> he would now also be pleas'd to continue his favor by Letters of Recommendation to <HI>Peking</HI> in their behalf; which he promis'd.</P>
<P>The one and twentieth and two and twentieth the Governors Factors came again to <HI>Nobel</HI> to Treat with him about the Price of their Goods, yet return'd without making any Conclusion.</P>
<P>The twenty third nothing hapned worth observation.</P>
<P>The twenty fourth the Generals Factors came to fetch their Majesties Presents.</P>
<P>And now in regard the time began to approach when the <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships were to Sail from the Coast, and the Emperors Letter came thither the eighteenth Instant, yet the Ambassador had not receiv'd the least benefit of it more than be|fore, because the <HI>Chinese</HI> Merchants, so long as no other Bills were put up before the Lodge than what had been there ever since his coming, they durst not come to buy the <HI>Netherland</HI> Commodities; therefore he wrote a Letter to the Gene|ral, That since the Emperors Letter was come from <HI>Peking,</HI> he did not doubt but the Trade might be driven, and Proclamations of his Majesties Letters be put up, as in their former Years; and also that the little Ship might be suffer'd to go down to fetch some Merchandise. This Letter translated into the <HI>Chi|nese</HI> Tongue the Interpreter would not carry; neither were the <HI>Hollanders</HI> suf|fer'd by the General's Order to come into the City; wherefore it was unani|mously concluded, That the Ambassador should immediately in Person go to the General, and tell him the Contents of it <HI>verbatim,</HI> with many other things; and
<PB N="243" REF="142">
if his Excellency should be stopp'd at the City Gates, he should return without taking any further notice, and then send away the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> without a Pass.</P>
<P>The Ambassador hereupon made himself ready to go to the Court; but going to sit in his Sedan, or <HI>Palakin,</HI> there were no <HI>Coelies,</HI> or Porters to be had to carry it, the <HI>Mandarin</HI> that kept the Guard at the Lodge having forbidden them: Yet resolving to prosecute his Design, he went thither on foot, not|withstanding it was above an hours Walk: coming to the City Gates he was stopp'd a little, because the Soldiers that were on the Guard would first send to acquaint the General with it before they would let him in: whereupon he going back a little, ask'd the Guards if they had order to keep him out? who though they made the former Answer, yet suffer'd him to pass; whereupon sending notice to the General of his being there, after several Excuses he was admitted and brought before him; by whom being plac'd, he desir'd him to excuse the <HI>Hollanders</HI> for being thus troublesom to him, as being forc'd thereto: for whereas they hop'd, that after the coming of the Emperor's Letter they should have been permitted to drive their Trade, and enjoy more freedom than before; on the contrary, it was worse and worse: for their Letters could not be deliver'd, nor their People admitted into the City: nay more, the <HI>Manda|rin</HI> that had the Guard of the Lodge had forbid the <HI>Coelies</HI> to do their duty to himself. To which the General answer'd, That he never forbid the <HI>Coelies,</HI> nor had given order to keep him out at the Gates; but that it was onely meant to the Sea-men, that came to buy several things in the City which he would not suffer. Then the Ambassador deliver'd him the Letter writ that Morning; which having read, he answer'd, That the little Ship might go down freely; to which purpose he would send either a Pass or a <HI>Mandarin.</HI> The Trade granted by the Emperor he also permitted them in the same manner. Moreover he would order other Bills to be writ, and put before the Lodge, that the <HI>Nether|landers</HI> might Trade with whom they would; but they must remember not to buy any Goods which in the Proclamation were forbidden to be Transported, <HI>viz.</HI> Silk, <HI>Pelangs, Panjes,</HI> and the like Stuffs. And as concerning their Mer|chandise, they held them up too high, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nobel</HI> hearing him speak of Trade (which was his Business) answer'd, That they did not set too high a value on their Commodities, but that the Factors would not give so much for them now as heretofore, and if they should dis|pose of their Goods at their Rates they should lose by them; therefore desir'd his Highness to send other People to deal with them, not being willing to have to do with his Factors.</P>
<P>Hereupon the General seeming to be somewhat displeas'd, diverted the Discourse, asking the Ambassador when he would take his Journey? he re|ply'd, When the Trade was finish'd; also that several Goods to be given to the Council must be fetch'd from <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven: To which he made no Answer, but look'd strange when he heard the Council of State mention'd.</P>
<P>Then the Ambassador told him by his Interpreter, That as he would be obe|dient to his Highness in all things, and govern himself, according to the Cu|stom of the Countrey; so he hop'd the General would give order that he might not lose his Reputation, nor be sleighted; desiring his Highness to take notice, that he was the Representative of the <HI>Netherland</HI> Nation, and would rather die than his Masters, the States of <HI>Holland,</HI> should suffer any Reproach through his miscarriage. To which he reply'd, That no such thing was in|tended, that should either be a prejudice to their Honor, or dissatisfaction to
<PB N="244" REF="143">
himself as their Ambassador. Whereupon he requested, that his Highness would give order to his Factor for the sudden dispatch of the Trade, as he would also to <HI>Nobel.</HI></P>
<P>In the Afternoon the <HI>Mandarin Liu-lavja</HI> came to the Lodge, being sent from the General to the Ambassador, with two exact Copies of the Letters from <HI>Peking,</HI> who ask'd him if he would sell all his Commodities there, or carry them to <HI>Peking?</HI> To which he answer'd, That he would vend them there. Moreover, the <HI>Mandarin</HI> desir'd to have a List of his Followers that were to at|tend him in his Embassy to <HI>Peking,</HI> that he might provide <HI>Coelies</HI> for him. He promis'd also to bring a Pass for the Ship the next Morning; and likewise Bills to stick up before the Lodge.</P>
<P>The twenty ninth and thirtieth nothing hapned of note.</P>
<P>In the Evening the first of <HI>December</HI> the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> set Sail, Laden with several<NOTE PLACE="marg">December.</NOTE> fresh Provisions for the Ships in <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven and at <HI>Tenhay.</HI></P>
<P>Next Morning <HI>Harthouwer</HI> and <HI>Vander Does</HI> went with the Boat to <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, to take an exact account of all the Money and Goods seized on and ta|ken from the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and to send them with the ten Chests of Silver belong|ing to the Company, with the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat to <HI>Lamthay</HI> near <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> where the Ambassador resided with his Retinue.</P>
<P>The fourth the Factors, after having some days before agreed on the Prices of the Goods, began in the presence of the two <HI>Mandarins, Liu</HI> and <HI>Liu-lavja,</HI> to weigh and receive the Pepper at the Lodge.</P>
<P>The Ambassador also the same day writ to the General to this effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe Prices of the Merchandise are now agreed on, and the two Ships may come into the River up to the Town; but the great Ship at <HI>Tenhay</HI> must deliver her Goods there: That the Ambassador depends upon <HI>Talavja</HI>'s goodness; wherefore he was embold|ned to request, that the two Ships might come one by one up to the Tower: to which purpose he desir'd they might have Passes, that so the Merchandise might be taken out of them with the more convenience and celerity: That if <HI>Talavja</HI> would please to order, that the Pep|per and <HI>Sandal</HI> Wood might be weighed by the Factors below in the Ships, the Ambassador would take it as a great favor.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This being carry'd by the Interpreter <HI>de Hase,</HI> he receiv'd this Answer, That the General would speak with the Factors about it, and then send his Re|solution.</P>
<P>The fifth they spent in weighing of Pepper.</P>
<P>The sixth the two <HI>Chineses</HI> from <HI>Batavia</HI> came to the Ambassador, desiring that they might go with him as Interpreters to <HI>Peking,</HI> having been detain'd with the rest of the Prisoners two Moneths in a <HI>Spanish</HI> Jonk in <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and now set at liberty upon Security.</P>
<P>The seventh nothing was done.</P>
<P>The eighth in the Morning the Ambassador sent the Interpreter <HI>de Hase</HI> to the General, to have an Answer of the Letter sent to him the fourth Instant.</P>
<P>The same day <HI>Harthouwer</HI> and the Secretary <HI>Vander Does</HI> came with the <HI>Vlaer|ding</HI> Boat from <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, and gave an Account to the Ambassador, That they had done all things there according to his Excellencies Order; that the <HI>Vlaerding</HI> was Unladen of all her Pepper, and the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Laden full with <HI>Calicutor</HI> and <HI>Sandal</HI> Wood, so that there was nothing remaining in the <HI>Vlaerding</HI> but a little of the fore-mention'd Woods, a small parcel of Tin, and some Lead, with which they had left the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> at the great Tower. The seized
<PB N="245" REF="143">
<HI>Chinese</HI> Goods and Moneys they had open'd, and added the Coyn to the Am|bassador's Accounts. When going down to <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven they saw War|like Preparations, of which making enquiry, they told them that thirty <HI>Coxingan</HI> Jonks were seen hovering near the Point of <HI>Hoitang:</HI> whereupon the Gover|nor of <HI>Minjazen</HI> receiv'd order, not onely to put himself in a posture of Defence, but also to drive them from the Coast. From thence being got to <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, towards the Evening the <HI>Mandarin</HI> which kept Guard with the Jonks came aboard the <HI>Vlaerding,</HI> to inform them, That several <HI>Coxingan</HI> Jonks were come to <HI>Tenhay,</HI> who counterfeiting themselves carry'd the <HI>Tartars</HI> Colours, and that two of them had put in to <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, and he left them there at his coming from thence: Wherefore the <HI>Vlaerdings</HI> Boat went thither with the Secretary by the Night-tyde, to give notice thereof to the <HI>Alphen,</HI> one of their Vessels, Riding at an Anchor there, to keep good Watches, and be very care|ful. When the Secretary arriv'd at <HI>Tenhay,</HI> the Sea-men of the <HI>Alphen</HI> inform'd him, That the Night before fifteen <HI>Coxingan Coya's</HI> (which are little Vessels of forty and sixty Tun, with a single Mast) had view'd their Ship, but at the firing five Guns at them they all fled; besides twenty four great Jonks, which onely shewed themselves about the Islands, without making any attempt upon their Ship.</P>
<P>The fifth in the Morning fifteen <HI>Tartar</HI> Jonks coming out of the <HI>Hole,</HI> Sail'd to the <HI>Crocodile Islands,</HI> and return'd again in the Evening, with intention to run in at <HI>Tenhay;</HI> but those of the <HI>Alphen</HI> firing their Cannon prevented their Design.</P>
<P>The same day the Interpreter <HI>de Hase</HI> (who had been sent the fourth In|stant to the General) came back with his Interpreter, to tell the Ambassador in his Masters Name, That the Ship might freely come up to the Tower, and that he would write about it to the Governor of <HI>Minjazen;</HI> and ask'd more|over, if the Ambassador would be ready against the twenty fifth Instant to re|pair to <HI>Peking:</HI> To which the Ambassador sent the following Letter as an Answer to the General, which was to this effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe Ambassador thanks <HI>Talavja</HI> for his good Inclinations. The Pepper which was in the Lodge, being about two thousand three hundred <HI>Picols,</HI> hath been deliver'd to the Factors; therefore the Ambassador desires that <HI>Talavja</HI> will be pleas'd to order the Factors, that the Allom, Gold-wyre, and other Commodities may be deliver'd to the <HI>Hopou;</HI> that in a little time one of the Ships may Sail to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and the Ambassador make himself ready for his Journey to <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>About three days after the Ambassador and his whole Retinue were invited to come to the Vice-Roy on the eleventh Instant to a <HI>Wayang,</HI> desiring him also to bring his Musicians along with him, because he had a great desire to hear them.</P>
<P>The eleventh in the Morning <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s Factor came to the Lodge to wait upon the Ambassador according to the Invitation: who coming to the Court, and being conducted to the common Hall, there came some <HI>Chineses</HI> to him, which two years since had deserted <HI>Coxinga,</HI> and submitted to the <HI>Tartars;</HI> who with the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were also conducted into the Presence, and plac'd opposite to each other on his right Hand. He having enquir'd after the Am|bassador's Health, said that he had no time till then to entertain his Lord|ship, but seeing so fair an opportunity, of relaxing from publick Concerns,
<PB N="246" REF="144">
he desir'd that they might rejoyce and be merry together. Whereupon the Tables being spread with variety of Dishes, whilstt hey sat and pleas'd their Palats with diversity of <HI>Acates;</HI> their Eyes also were feasted with mimick Entries of several Antimasques; when the Vice-Roy desir'd some of their Mu|sick, and to hear their Musicians Play, which fill'd up the Intermeans with great satisfaction. Thus having spent most part of the day with a continu'd Feast, and variety of Divertisements, the Ambassador returning Thanks, and they being all in good humor, took his Leave, and in the Evening went to his Lodgings.</P>
<P>About Noon the next day the <HI>Mandarins, Liu</HI> and <HI>Lavja,</HI> came to demand the detain'd <HI>Chinese</HI> Goods, urging many Reasons to that purpose. But the Ambas|sador answer'd, That he neither could nor durst restore them, till he had Or|ders from <HI>Batavia.</HI> Which Demand and Answer rais'd a great Heat on both sides: Whereupon the Ambassador, by the advice of his Council, sent a Letter to <HI>Talavja,</HI> the substance whereof follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THat the Ambassador hath always receiv'd favor and respect from <HI>Talavja,</HI> for which he is very thankful; yet he hath now sent twice to com|mand him to restore the Goods belonging to the <HI>Chineses</HI> that came from <HI>Bata|via:</HI> The General well knows, he was desir'd to take notice, that the <HI>Chineses</HI> have driven a private Trade formerly in the <HI>Holland</HI> Ships, and with their Com|modities; therefore the Lord General had directed the Ambassador to observe them strictly and prevent it: That his Highness would be pleas'd to consider, that the Ambassador cannot restore them without order from his Masters; therefore he desires the General to have patience till he had writ to them and receiv'd their Answer: That he shall, according to <HI>Talavja</HI>'s Pleasure, use all means possible to perswade that the Goods may be restor'd, and then he shall be satisfi'd, and the Ambassador be blameless.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The General's Factor came the same day to invite the Ambassador to ano|ther Feast or <HI>Wayang,</HI> and desir'd him in his Masters behalf that he would bring his Musick with him, because he was very desirous to hear them. To which he answer'd, That he would be there at the appointed time, and satisfie his Masters Request.</P>
<P>The fifteenth in the Morning the Interpreter <HI>Ienko</HI> went with the fore-men|tion'd Letter to the Court, to shew it the General: from whence returning he brought in Answer, That his Highness expected him at Dinner, and then he would talk further. But before he went he advis'd with his Council, what was best to be answer'd, if the General should first move the Business, and ask where the Goods were? what they amounted to? where they would leave them while they took their Journey to <HI>Peking?</HI> and if they intended to re|store them or not? 'Twas judg'd convenient, that to the General's Question, Where the Goods were? the Ambassador should answer, Aboard the several Ships: The value of them, and what they were? They would give an ac|count of at convenient time: concerning the restoring them, he should say, That it could not be done without order from <HI>Batavia:</HI> and if he ask'd where they would leave them? to reply, That the Money should be made use of for their Expences; but withal to assure him, that no part of it should be dimi|nished, but upon Orders from <HI>Batavia</HI> be repay'd.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Ambassador went to the Court with all his Attendants: where coming, and having stay'd a short space in the common Hall, they
<PB N="247" REF="144">
were conducted into an Anti-Chamber near the publick Place of Audience: where the General sat on a Stool before a Table, with other Tables standing on both sides of him, furnish'd with several Dishes. The Ambassador was plac'd next <HI>Talavja,</HI> and his chief Followers on Benches on each Hand of him; when being all seated, they were serv'd very plentifully with variety of Meats and Drinks, and betwixt their Courses Farces presented to them, whilst the General drank very freely, and pressed the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to turn up their Bowls and be merry. After having spent some time, the Ambassador's Musick was order'd to Play; with which the General was much delighted. The time ap|proaching for their departure, the Interpreter bid the Ambassador speak to his Highness about the <HI>Chinese</HI> Goods: which caus'd him to ask if he had receiv'd the Letter which he had sent to him in the Morning? who reply'd, Yes, he had, and understood the Contents. Moreover he said, That in the time of the War some of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Inhabitants fled, which now in time of Peace came to their Countrey again, bringing with them what by long trouble and labor they had got together: He had spoke with the Vice-Roy about it, who also thought it was an unhandsom action to detain their Goods; and therefore he would have them restor'd, having an Inventory of them from the poor Men they were taken from.</P>
<P>The Ambassador in answer thereto reply'd, That he would not contest with the General, but that he could not, nor durst restore them, but if he would take them by force he might. To which the General making no reply, chang'd his Discourse, saying, That a <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonk coming from <HI>Batavia</HI> was cast away before <HI>Canton,</HI> whose chief Commander very well knew the Ambas|sador and <HI>Constantine Nobel:</HI> wherefore he ask'd if that Jonk came in company with them from <HI>Batavia?</HI> and if the Ambassador knew any thing concerning it? who answer'd, That he was ignorant of it, much less that they came with them from <HI>Batavia.</HI> Which Discourse ended, the Ambassador desir'd leave to depart, which was accordingly granted.</P>
<P>The same day the <HI>Conbon</HI>'s Factors came to invite him on the sixteenth to a Feast, or <HI>Wayang,</HI> to which he promis'd to come.</P>
<P>The sixteenth nothing pass'd worthy of observation, onely the Factors deli|ver'd some Allom.</P>
<P>According to the Invitation on the fifteenth by the <HI>Conbon</HI>'s Factors, the Am|bassador went thither with his Attendants; and coming to his Palace he was conducted into a Hall, when after a short stay, because some <HI>Mandarins</HI> were busie with the <HI>Conbon,</HI> he was call'd into the Presence Chamber, where the Ta|bles were ready cover'd; and being bid Welcom, was desir'd to sit down at a Table, standing on the left Hand, and his Attendants each in their respective Place, where they pass'd the time in Feasting till the Evening, when the Am|bassador took his Leave of the <HI>Conbon</HI> and departed.</P>
<P>BUt now to digress a little concerning their <HI>Chinese Wayangs,</HI> or Stage-plays;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trigaut.</NOTE> <HI>Trigaut</HI> reports that they are strangely delighted with such Divertise|ments; and the Actors on the other side have an extraordinary faculty therein, so that an incredible number of their Youth maintain themselves by Acting, every where shewing both Comick and Tragick Presentations.</P>
<P>The first Inventer of their Drammaticks, who (as they say) not onely writ, but taught them Action, and how to tread the Stage, was one <HI>Sheeking;</HI> who for his merits in such Poesie stands ranked in no mean Place amongst their

Gods, and held in especial Veneration by the Actors; for they never begin their Interludes before a solemn Invocation and Offering made to him their chief Deity; nay, so much are they devoted to his Worship, that the meanest amongst them wears his Effigies, or Medal, hanging by his Side, always imploring that he would please to strengthen their Memory, and quicken their Fancy, to Act and Personate well their Parts, never regarding to understand their Author, more than ours do: but in such esteem did the <HI>Chineses</HI> hold them, that all their Thanksgivings for their Deliverances and Victories, are instead of <HI>Christian</HI> De|votion and solemn Praises, set forth in glad Eulogiums, adapted to the several Stories, with various Personatings on the Stage. Some are such as having a kind of Licence, strolling from Town to Town through the Empire to erect Stages; others have Theatres setled in the chief Cities, and sent for from thence upon all occasions, to Act such Plays as are desir'd, at all celebrated Feasts to height|en their Entertainments: To which purpose they have a Book with a Cata|logue of what they are ready to Act, being commonly true Stories set forth in a Poetical Dress. They deliver their Parts in a kind of Tone betwixt Speaking and Singing, such as we call Chanting, varying according to the Argument and Humor they present. Their Habits when they represent Tragicks are ve|ry gawdy; their Comicks as ours, according to their Matters. But although they observe all the Decorums and Ornaments of the Stage as much as any in <HI>Europe,</HI> yet none, even of the meanest <HI>Chineses,</HI> in their Lives and Conversations are more debauch'd and vitious.</P>
<P>The eighteenth nothing hapned of any note, being spent onely in the recei|ving of <HI>China</HI> Roots and Quicksilver.</P>
<P>The nineteenth the Secretary at his going out met accidentally with two <HI>Hollanders,</HI> which seem'd to be Strangers, and were carrry'd on travelling Chairs made of Canes, who saluted the Secretary with taking off their Hats, but passing by a great pace, as in <HI>transitu,</HI> he had no time to speak to them.</P>
<P>The Interpreter <HI>de Hase</HI> acquainted the Ambassador, that he had heard from
<PB N="249" REF="145">
some <HI>Chineses,</HI> that a <HI>Holland</HI> Ship was arriv'd at <HI>Sincheu;</HI> who making enquiry after it, was inform'd that two <HI>Holland</HI> Ships lay at <HI>Sanchefoe;</HI> and also that two <HI>Hollanders</HI> belonging to the said Ships were that Morning gone to the General.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon the <HI>Mandarin Liu-lavja</HI> came to tell the Ambassador from the General, that he was to take but twenty of his Train with him to <HI>Hoksieu:</HI> whereupon the Ambassador ask'd if the Horses and Oxen should not be brought up to <HI>Peking&punc;</HI> for then more Men would be necessarily requir'd? but he would leave it to the General to order as many as he pleas'd. He also ask'd if there had been no <HI>Hollanders</HI> with the General? he reply'd, That when he came from <HI>Talavja</HI>'s Court he saw two <HI>Hollanders</HI> stand at the Door, which were come thi|ther by Land from <HI>Sincheu,</HI> but that he knew not in what Ship they came thither.</P>
<P>The twenty fourth in the Morning the General's Interpreter came to the Lodge, to tell the Ambassador from his Lord, that the Vessels, Horses, <HI>Coelies,</HI> and all things necessary for the Journey were now ready, therefore ask'd when he would please to set forward? Moreover he said, That a <HI>Mandarin</HI> was come from the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong,</HI> to know the time; and that he did m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">h won|der what made the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> so dilatory in the Journey, which at first they were so hasty for; therefore he desir'd them to appoint the certain Day, that he might acquaint his Master. Which the Ambassador thus answer'd, That there were some Goods yet remaining in the Ships which were for the <HI>Lipovies,</HI> that must be unladen and pack'd up before he could go; and also the Trade must be finish'd, and the Factors Goods be deliver'd, because the <HI>Hopou Nobel</HI> must go with him. On which the Interpreter ask'd, how long time it re|quir'd before all could be finish'd? In a short time, reply'd the Ambassador, it may be done, if they ascertain their Weights, and deliver their Silk according to the Patterns.</P>
<P>While they were arguing these Matters, the <HI>Mandarins, Liu</HI> and <HI>Liu-lavja</HI> came to the Lodge with Orders from the General; in which he commanded that the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> should restore the seized <HI>Chinese</HI> Goods; which were to this purpose:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe General of <HI>Fokien</HI> helps his Natives. <HI>Liu</HI> and <HI>Liu-lavja,</HI> both <HI>Manda|rins,</HI> have acquainted the General in Writing concerning the <HI>Batavian Chinese</HI> Goods, detain'd in the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ships; which the General sends this <HI>Mandarin</HI> to fetch thence: To which purpose the Ambassador is hereby desir'd to send one of his Servants to go down with him to shew the Goods, that they may be taken away: When they are come hither, the <HI>Chineses</HI> shall set them down Piece by Piece, and shew them to the General; then after further Orders from the Emperor they shall be deliver'd to the Owners. The <HI>Chineses</HI> are also commanded to keep an exact account of what Goods are brought up of theirs in the Barque to <HI>Lamthay.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>Hereupon the Ambassador told them, that <HI>Nobel, Harthouwer,</HI> and <HI>Vander Does</HI> should go to the General, to ask if that were his Will and Command: To which the <HI>Mandarins</HI> reply'd, That they would stay and go with them, to hear <HI>Talavja</HI>'s Order, and govern themselves accordingly. The <HI>Mandarin Liu-lavja</HI> also said, That two <HI>Hollanders</HI> which had been at <HI>Tayowan,</HI> were now at the Generals, and ask'd if the Ambassador knew them? who answer'd, How should he know them, when he had never seen them; but desir'd that they might be shewn to some of his Servants, who might perhaps know them.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="146">Dinner being ended, <HI>Nobel, Harthouwer,</HI> and the Secretary <HI>Vander Does,</HI> went with the fore-mention'd Orders to the General; into whose Presence after some stay being admitted, they ask'd if that was his Highness's Writing and Order? whereupon he answering <HI>Yes,</HI> pointed to the Seal, saying, That it was his, and none else gave such a Mark; and therefore he wondred why they detain|ed the Goods; but there were two <HI>Hollanders</HI> come thither, which he would give them. To which they reply'd, That as to what concern'd their Coun|trey-men, if his Highness did restore them, they would be thankful for it; but they could not deliver the <HI>Chinese</HI> Goods without Orders from <HI>Batavia;</HI> that the Ambassador had seized them in the Lord <HI>Maetzuiker</HI>'s Name, being brought by the <HI>Chineses</HI> against his Order, in stead of Necessaries; therefore if the Am|bassador could restore them again without his knowledge, they desir'd his Highness to consider: who reply'd, That he was a great Lord, and also one of the <HI>Lipous,</HI> he did not desire the Goods, but was oblig'd, they being his Sub|jects, to speak for them: whereto was answer'd, That the Ambassador was also a Person of Quality, and one of the <HI>Indian</HI> Council, neither did he desire the Goods, nay, rather wish'd they had not been brought aboard; but since it was so, he could not let them go without Order: whereupon the General said, He should let the Business rest, till News came about it from the Empe|ror; but when his Imperial Majesty commanded the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> then they must restore them whether they were willing or not: then changing his Dis|course, ask'd when the Ambassador would go his Journey; and all the <HI>Coelies,</HI> Horses, and Vessels being now ready, he could not imagine what was now wanting; he had writ to the Emperor three times that the Ambassador should come up, but he saw as yet no likelihood of it, therefore knew not what he might think; what-ever they had requested of him he had granted, yet still they came with new Desires, so that he knew not how to deal with them, nor could imagine why they came thither; and that they now gave him cause to think they were a People, on whose Words was no depending, saying one thing to day, and another to morrow. Hereupon he was answer'd, That they stay'd onely for the Trade, because the <HI>Hopou Nobel</HI> must go to <HI>Peking,</HI> but be|fore he could go the Trade must be finish'd. To which the General reply'd, That he had granted them to Trade, he had provided Barques and Jonks for the unlading of their Commodities; nay more, that one of the Ships might come up to the Tower, that they might make the quicker dispatch: and it was true, that he had commanded no Quick-silver should be Transported, because the Emperor had forbid it; however, he would have wink'd at it; but because the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> had told some of his <HI>Mandarins,</HI> that they had got it from the Vice-Roy, he would have it taken away again, and not suffer one <HI>Conderin</HI> weight to be Transported. As to what concern'd the other Commodi|ties<NOTE PLACE="marg">A <HI>Conderin</HI> is a small <HI>Chinese</HI> Weight.</NOTE> which were not prohibited, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> might carry out as many as they pleas'd. Whereupon he was answer'd, That they did not know who had told any of his <HI>Mandarins</HI> that the Quick-silver was bought of the Vice-Roy, but that the Factors were the occasion of all those Differences, because they hindred them in their Business: the Ship lying at the Tower would by this time have been unladen, if they had proceeded in weighing the Goods as they ought; but they us'd false Weights, which the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> finding out, left the Ship and went ashore. To which the General answer'd, That the Pepper in the Ship was mix'd with Sand, and therefore the Factors had us'd such Weights: The <HI>Netherlanders</HI> (said he) would have the repute of fair Dealers,
<PB N="251" REF="146">
but they are none; for to mingle their Pepper with Sand and Water was no honest part. To which they answer'd, That they knew nothing concerning any such thing, therefore they would willingly go with any of his Factors Aboard to view the Pepper, in which if they found either Sand or Water, they would undergo both the penalty and scandal: In the mean time they urg'd that they might carry out the Quick-silver for that time, since it was al|ready Shipp'd. To which the General made no Reply, but onely that his Fa|ctors should the next Morning go Aboard and agree with them, that the Am|bassador might the sooner go set forth to <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>The two <HI>Europeans</HI> were according to <HI>Liu-lavja</HI>'s Promise shewn to the <HI>Ne|therlanders,</HI> and found to be Renegado's; the one being the first, that desert|ing the Castle <HI>Zelandia,</HI> on the Island <HI>Formosa,</HI> went to the <HI>Chineses;</HI> which at the first questioning they acknowledg'd. And according to their Relation, they were on the eighth Day of the twelfth Moon, in <HI>Formosa,</HI> and were come in a <HI>Chinese</HI> Vessel from thence to Trade to the Coast of <HI>China;</HI> that onely one Renegado was alive in <HI>Tayowan.</HI> But the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> being just at that instant call'd to the General, had not time to examine them further; but taking their leave of him, they desir'd that they might take the Renegado's along with them to the Lodge; which the General refusing, said that he must first examine them.</P>
<P>The twenty fourth in the Morning came the <HI>Mandarin Liu-lavja</HI> to the Lodge, with Orders from the General to fetch the Quick-silver out of the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Fri|gat. Whereupon the Ambassador desiring him to stay a little, wrote the fol|lowing Letter to the General.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe Ambassador knows very well that <HI>Talavja</HI> is a Person of Honor, and just&punc; and therefore he is assur'd, that when he shall be rightly inform'd of all things, he will be satisfi'd. And as to the Quick-silver and Pepper, he hop'd that Dispute was over; That the Ambassador wishes to go to <HI>Peking</HI> with the first opportunity, and therefore desires that the Factors may hasten the unlading of the Ships, that the Presents which are for the <HI>Lipous</HI> and <HI>Lavja's</HI> may be Pack'd, and put into a readiness.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>With this Letter the Interpreter <HI>de Hase</HI> went to the General, but brought no other Answer than this, That the Ambassador should shortly know his Mind.</P>
<P>The Emperor's Factors having been with <HI>Nobel,</HI> they told him, That they would not deliver any Silk, but pay him for his Commodities with ready Money; and likewise that they would not go to the <HI>Tyger</HI> Frigat for any more Pepper.</P>
<P>A <HI>Mandarin</HI> came also to tell the Ambassador in the Generals behalf, That he must so order his Business, that within ten days he might go to <HI>Peking;</HI> and likewise ask'd for the Names of those that were to go with him.</P>
<P>The twenty fifth in the Morning the Council resolv'd to make preparation for the Packing of the Presents, according to the Inventory written by <HI>Nobel</HI> on the eleventh Instant, that the General might see the Ambassador resolv'd to go; and also that <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Harthouwer</HI> should go to the Factors, and ask them if they would go down to receive any more Pepper or not? and likewise to speak with <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s prime Factors concerning the Silk, and tell him, That the Ambassador was to take his Journey a few days hence; therefore they must in short declare their Intentions, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> might govern themselves
<PB N="252" REF="147">
accordingly; and also endeavor to make them abate the Price of the course Silk; in which Case they should be impower'd to make an Agreement. More|over it was concluded, that a List of the Names of those Persons that were to go to <HI>Peking</HI> should be sent to <HI>Talavja,</HI> being in number twenty seven <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> and six <HI>Blacks;</HI> all which was accordingly perform'd.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon two Interpreters came to the Lodge from the General to tell the Ambassador, That the Quick-silver must be taken out of the Ships again, because it was publickly known, and would come to the Emperor's Ear, who had prohibited it: but hereafter if they kept it private, the <HI>Nether|landers</HI> might carry out as much as they would. To which the Ambassador an|swer'd, That there were <HI>Mandarins</HI> gone to the Ships to fetch it out; and if the Ship should chance to be gone to <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, he would give order that the Quick-silver should be kept in it and brought up again; for which he pro|mis'd to be Security till it was done. Moreover the Ambassador bid them tell <HI>Talavja,</HI> That they were now busily Packing up their Goods, to be ready against the limited time of ten days; therefore he desir'd him to command his Factors to make an end of the Trade.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon, a Sea-man came in a <HI>Batziang</HI> from <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, with a Letter from Captain <HI>Iohn Vander Werf,</HI> Dated the twenty fifth instant, from the <HI>Vlaerding</HI> Frigat; by which he advis'd the Ambassador, that three <HI>Man|darins</HI> were come from the General aboard the <HI>Vlaerding,</HI> and commanded him, that he should not take the Quicksilver out of the <HI>Blyswiik,</HI> till further Order; Wherefore he desir'd to know, what he was to do in that affair.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Ambassador wrote immediately an answer: That since the General had prohibited Quicksilver, he might let it remain in the <HI>Blyswiik,</HI> and with the rest of the Goods out of the <HI>Vlaerding;</HI> and what was more wanting, to make up her full Lading, he might take out of the <HI>Constance,</HI> and (as soon as he could) also come himself.</P>
<P>The six and twentieth, the Lord <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> observing that the sending away of the <HI>Vlaerding</HI> could be no longer put off, wrote a Letter concerning it to this purpose to the General.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe Ambassador shall never fail to acknowledge <HI>Talavja</HI>'s Favors in all<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Letter to the Gene|ral <HI>Talavja.</HI></NOTE> things, and accordingly, makes himself ready, that he may with the first opportunity go to <HI>Peking,</HI> and therefore as a token of his Respect, he gives notice to <HI>Talavja,</HI> that in four days time, a Ship shall go to <HI>Batavia;</HI> as also, two more a little after; therefore if his Highness will please to write to the Lord General and <HI>Indian</HI> Council in <HI>Batavia,</HI> it will be well, but it is at his own option.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>With this Letter <HI>Harthouwer</HI> went to <HI>Talavja,</HI> who being busie about other affairs, so that he could not speak with himself, he sent the Letter by his Inter|preter, and bid him tell his Master, that the reason why they had some days since desir'd that the other Ship might come up to the Tower was, because the Factors would not receive the Pepper out of that Ship there present.</P>
<P>The Interpreter coming back, brought this answer.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THat having receiv'd the Ambassador's Letter, and understood the Con|tents<NOTE PLACE="marg">The General's Answer.</NOTE> of it, he would the next Morning send him an answer by some of his <HI>Mandarins;</HI> but let him know before, that not above twenty Persons in all could go with the Ambassador to <HI>Peking,</HI> because the Emperor had so Com|manded.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="253" REF="147">
He also caus'd the two <HI>Mandarins</HI> that were to go with the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to tell <HI>Harthouwer,</HI> that if they had ought else to request of the General, they should do it speedily, because they had Order to grant it.</P>
<P>Mean while, <HI>Nobel</HI> went to the Governors Factors to receive Money of them in stead of Silk; Who answer'd him, That they would pay their Debt within three or four days.</P>
<P>At the same time, the Vice-Roy and General's Interpreters came to tell the Ambassador, that it would be necessary to be ready for his intended Journey in five days. To which <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> answer'd, That he would endeavor (if pos|sible) to obey their Highnesses Commands, having already put the business in good forwardness.</P>
<P>The two <HI>Mandarins</HI> which were appointed to go to <HI>Peking,</HI> came to have the List of the Names of his Attendants.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nobel</HI> desires a Pass for the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the Morning, being the twenty ninth, <HI>Nobel</HI> according to their resoluti|on taken the day before, went to the General with a Letter, to desire a Pass of him for the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat to go down again: The Contents of which were as followeth.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe Ambassador hopes that <HI>Talavja</HI> will not be offended for coming again<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nobel's</HI> Request to the General.</NOTE> to beg a Request of him, being now ready to set forth towards <HI>Peking;</HI> in which regard, and for that he must write all his business at large to the Lord <HI>Maetzuiker</HI> in <HI>Batavia;</HI> therefore the Ambassador desires, that the small Vessel may go again to <HI>Tinghay,</HI> to take the Goods out of the great Ship, and that he will please to grant a Pass for her, and the Boat with fresh Provisions; and also that he will send half a dozen Jonks with them to fetch Goods from <HI>Tinghay</HI> to <HI>Lamthay,</HI> that then they might finish their Trade, and the Ships go away; for which the Ambassador shall most highly be oblieg'd to <HI>Talavja</HI> and the Emperor.</P>
<P>The Ambassador hath understood by the <HI>Hopou,</HI> that two <HI>Netherlanders</HI> are brought Prisoners to <HI>Talavja,</HI> which he desires may be permitted to come and speak with him.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>Nobel</HI> coming back, related that he could not speak with the General, but sent him the Letter by his Interpreter; Who brought answer, That he should not fail to hear from him in the Afternoon; which was accordingly per|form'd: for the <HI>Mandarins, Liu</HI> and <HI>Liu-lavja,</HI> came to the Lodge to tell the Am|bassador, That the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ships must be unladen in five days, and the <HI>Con|stance</HI> Frigat might freely come up to the Tower, that they might the sooner be unfreighted; but no Ship might go away before the seized on <HI>Chinese</HI> Goods were come ashore; that all things must be ready for their Journey in fifteen days; and that three and twenty <HI>Hollanders</HI> might go to <HI>Peking,</HI> but not more. The Secretary, because he was a Scholar, might not go to <HI>Peking</HI> with the Ambassador, but the General would give order for two Interpreters. For the unlading of the <HI>Alphen</HI> at <HI>Tenhay</HI> the General would send six Jonks thither with the <HI>Blyswiik;</HI> and likewise a Pass for the fore-mention'd Frigat to go down again.</P>
<P>To the rest of their Desires <HI>Talavja</HI> had sent them no Answer.</P>
<P>The General's trusty or chief Factor, call'd <HI>Liu,</HI> came two several times to<NOTE PLACE="marg">The General's Factor's Proffer to <HI>Nobel.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Nobel</HI> the same day with another Story, That if they would, they should one|ly address themselves to him, and he would do their Business; and that his Master had so much ready kindness for them, that he aim'd at nothing more
<PB N="254" REF="148">
than to please their King <HI>Maetzuiker,</HI> by giving them all the dispatch and satis|faction he might.</P>
<P>To this civil Proffer (which the other Factors had chosen him to present)<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nobel's</HI> Answer.</NOTE> <HI>Nobel</HI> reply'd, That they would willingly deal for some Silks, if they would let them have the best, as they would do by them. Whereupon the Factor reply'd, That he would consult with the rest, and doubted not but to please them.</P>
<P>But as to that part of <HI>Siangpovi</HI>'s Resolve, That nothing should be done un|less the <HI>Chinese</HI> Goods were restor'd, the Ambassador and his Council consi|dering, unanimously agreed, That the Goods should be put into such a po|sture, that they might take them and convey them from thence, as if by force, leaving an outward Door lock'd, on purpose to be broke open.</P>
<P>The thirtieth in the Morning the Interpreter <HI>de Hase,</HI> according to yester|days Resolution, went to <HI>Talavja</HI>'s Court to him with a Letter, which was to this effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THat the Ambassador congratulates <HI>Talavja</HI>'s noble Disposition, in granting that the Ships shall be unfreighted. The Ambassador will endeavor to be ready to go to <HI>Peking</HI> in fifteen days. He will satisfie <HI>Talavja</HI> about the <HI>Chinese</HI> Goods, that then the <HI>Holland</HI> Ships may go to <HI>Batavia;</HI> upon which he desires some private Conference.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This Letter was no sooner deliver'd, but there came Orders quite contrary, That the term of fifteen days was too long for their departure; That no Ships should Sail from thence before the Ambassador's return from <HI>Peking:</HI> At which the Ambassador much startled, reply'd, That it seem'd very strange to him; for yesterday the <HI>Mandarins, Liu</HI> and <HI>Liulavja,</HI> had told him quite other|wise; so that he knew not what to say, or which to believe, for sure they could not both be the General's Order.</P>
<P>On the one and thirtieth the Ambassador sent <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Vander Does</HI> to the General, to ask him if he would write any thing to the Lord <HI>Maetzuiker</HI> by the Ship that was the next Morning to set Sail for <HI>Batavia,</HI> and to assure him, that since he had been pleas'd to command no Ship might go to <HI>Batavia,</HI> before the seized on <HI>Chinese</HI> Goods were brought ashore to the Lodge, That the fore-men|tion'd Goods were not in that Ship; but if he would please to send any of his <HI>Mandarins</HI> they should be shewn him where they were, that if he would he might take them, and they satisfie <HI>Talavja</HI> in all Points; and likewise that the Ambassador would be ready in eight days to go to <HI>Peking;</HI> in the mean while desiring him to give order for the six promis'd Jonks, and a Pass for the <HI>Blys|wiik,</HI> that with the Jonks she might go to <HI>Tenhay,</HI> and there unlade the great Ship.</P>
<P><HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Vander Does</HI> going to the Court, and having acquainted <HI>Talavja</HI> with their coming, he sent for his chief Factor <HI>Liu</HI> to receive their Message;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Novel</HI> and <HI>Vander Does</HI> Discourse with the Gene|ral.</NOTE> of which having notice they were admitted, when the General told them, That as to what concern'd the Ship, it could not go away before the Ambassador went to <HI>Peking,</HI> it being customary there, that any Vessel which brought an Ambassador, could not be dismiss'd till he had made his Address in Person to the Emperor. To which they reply'd, That the Ship was sent to <HI>Batavia</HI> one|ly to give an account of their Proceedings hitherto; which ought to have been done two Moneths since, according to their Orders, but it was put off upon his Highness's desire; but now it neither must nor could be any longer delay'd, because the Lord General, during the Ambassador's arrival there, having re|ceiv'd
<PB N="255" REF="148">
no news of his Excellencies Adventures and success in his Embassy, would not know what to think, and they coming to <HI>Batavia,</HI> suffer for their supine negligence.</P>
<P>The General reply'd, He advis'd the <HI>Hollanders</HI> not to let the Ship go away<NOTE PLACE="marg">His Answer.</NOTE> without his Order, because there were Jonks in <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven to prevent her; which would cause some clashing, and perhaps mischief might be done, which was much better to be avoided; neither should their stay be longer than two days at most: in which time the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> would come home again, with whom he would consult, and then send for <HI>Nobel</HI> to the Court, and give him their Resolution. Concerning the <HI>Chinese</HI> Goods, he de|sir'd them not, they might leave them aboard, or bring them ashore as they pleas'd themselves, till Orders came from the Emperor. That he had given order for the Jonks, and also a Pass for the <HI>Blyswiik,</HI> but he made no mention of the time limited for the Ambassador's departure, onely that when he came to <HI>Peking,</HI> he should strictly observe what he said or did.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Hollanders</HI> asking the General for the two Renegado's, he reply'd, That they were convey'd to <HI>Canton,</HI> where, they said, their Parents and Friends liv'd; and withal, that they were no <HI>Hollanders.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Vander Does</HI> were at the General's, the <HI>Mandarin Liu|lavja</HI> came again to the Lodge about the <HI>Chinese</HI> Goods, but was sent away again till their return; when they were inform'd of <HI>Talavja</HI>'s Order, and told, that it was convenient to take the Goods out of the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> (in which they were) and bring them ashore: whereupon <HI>Liu-lavja</HI> desir'd to go thither, that having seen them, he could give the better account thereof to <HI>Talavja;</HI> which being granted, he and two other <HI>Mandarins</HI> went with <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Vander Does</HI> to the <HI>Blyswiik,</HI> lying about half a League from the Bridge; from whence they return'd with the Goods in the Evening.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>Ianuary, Anno</HI> 1667. the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat set Sail, laden with Goods<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ianuary 1667.</NOTE> for the Coast of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> consisting in course <HI>Tee,</HI> Chests of Gold-wyre,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat sets Sail.</NOTE> Allom, and likewise Quick-silver, sent Aboard by the Factors the day before. The Commanders of the Frigat had order, that after the delivery of the Goods into the <HI>Vlaerding,</HI> they should immediately steer to <HI>Tenhay,</HI> to unlade the Ship <HI>Alphen</HI> into the six Jonks.</P>
<P>The second in the Morning Captain <HI>Iohn Vanderwerf</HI> went with a <HI>Batsiang</HI> to <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, to make himself ready, and prepare the <HI>Vlaerding</HI> to Sail for the Coast of <HI>Coromandel</HI> so soon as the Ambassador should give order. He had also three Letters given him; one for the Master of the <HI>Alphen</HI> lying at <HI>Tenhay,</HI> to acquaint him of the six Jonks coming to unlade his Ship, and likewise to order him to hasten the Business; the second was to the Master of the <HI>Constance, Peter Iansz de Vlieg,</HI> by which he was commanded with all speed to come to the great Tower to unlade there, that the Ships might be clear'd for their departure; the third was to the Governor and chief of the Council at <HI>Malacca;</HI> by which he was advis'd of the Ambassador's arrival in <HI>China</HI> on the third of <HI>August,</HI> and his Landing on the twenty fourth at <HI>Hoksieu;</HI> on which day he also had Audi|ence granted him by the three prime Governors; that an Order was come from <HI>Peking;</HI> the Trade driven, and so brought to pass, that the <HI>Vlaerding</HI> Frigat was got ready with her Lading on the first of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> to set Sail for <HI>Malacca.</HI></P>
<P>About Noon the <HI>Mandarin Liu-lavja</HI> came to the Lodge, being sent (as he said)<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Liu-lavja</HI> comes to the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> in the Lodge.</NOTE> to see the <HI>Chinese</HI> Goods and tell their Money; which the Ambassador would not suffer him to do, saying, That if <HI>Talavja</HI> would take the Goods from him,
<PB N="256" REF="149">
they might do what they would with them. Moreover, this <HI>Mandarin</HI> told them, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> must be ready in eight days to go to <HI>Peking,</HI> and that not above twenty four Persons should go along with him; and that three days hence he would come and take an account of all their Packs and Chests.</P>
<P>The third nothing hapned, but that a Parcel of Pepper and <HI>Sandal</HI> Wood was deliver'd to the Factors, as also the next day after.</P>
<P>Furthermore, the General promis'd, so soon as the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> was come home, to speak about the Ships going to the Coast of <HI>Coromandel,</HI> and that then he sending to <HI>Nobel</HI> would give him an account of it: But this was hitherto not done, and three days already pass'd since <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s coming home, and no Person come from <HI>Talavja</HI> to call <HI>Nobel;</HI> Therefore it was judg'd convenient (since the utmost time for the Ships departure was at hand, and that it already was the fourth of <HI>Ianuary</HI>) to send <HI>Nobel</HI> and the Secretary <HI>Van|der Does</HI> the next Morning to the General's, to put him in mind of his Promise, and also tell him that the Ship must go away the day following, though no order was given, which they desir'd his Highness would not take ill.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Vander Does</HI> go to the General.</NOTE></P>
<P>The fifth in the Morning <HI>Nobel</HI> and the Secretary went to the General, but found him not at home, being gone to the Vice-Roy's; but having stay'd a little while, he returning: by his Interpreters they acquainted him with the occasion of their coming. To which he answer'd, That he had spoke with the Vice-Roy about the Ships going away, who would not by any means permit it; and advis'd them to go to him themselves, to see if they could perswade him to it, which they did; but coming thither could not be admitted to his Presence: for <HI>Singlamong,</HI> inform'd of their coming, sent them word, that they should come again the next Morning (because at that time he was troubled with the Gripes, and weary with Travel) and that then he would give them Audience. On which it was resolv'd to give their Highnesses full satisfaction, and to put off the <HI>Vlaerdings</HI> departure so long.</P>
<P>Mean while the General's Factor call'd <HI>Thesin,</HI> came to tell the Ambassador, That he had understood of his Master, that the Ship might be gone, but that <HI>Hogenhoek</HI> must first speak with the Governor of <HI>Minjazen</HI> about it.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon the two <HI>Mandarins, Liu</HI> and <HI>Liu-lavja,</HI> came to the Lodge with an Order from the General, to fetch all the <HI>Chinese</HI> Goods from thence, which was to this effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>I Give order to <HI>Thesin</HI> and <HI>Haykong,</HI> that they carry the <HI>Batavian Chineses</HI> to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">The General's Order for the seized <HI>Batavian Chinese</HI> Goods.</NOTE> Ambassador, that they may see their Goods; and that then these <HI>Mandarins</HI> shall deliver them Parcel by Parcel to <HI>Tsiong</HI> and <HI>Sinshong,</HI> who shall be careful to look after them till farther order, that they may not be diminish'd. If the <HI>Hollanders</HI> have open'd the Chests, and taken any thing out of them, it is very ill done; therefore if any of them be missing, <HI>Thesin</HI> and <HI>Haykong</HI> must speak with the Ambassador about it, and desire him to restore them. Moreover an Order is expected from the Emperor, which when it comes, the Goods shall be again restor'd to the <HI>Batavian Chineses.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>On which Order, without asking for them, they took away those Goods<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are carry'd away.</NOTE> that were nearest at hand, and of small consequence, opening the Chests, and carrying them to their appointed Places; which they also thought to do with the Money and primest Commodities, standing in the Secretaries Chamber, had not the Ambassador prevented them; for the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> would not deli|ver those themselves, but onely shew'd them where they were; from whence
<PB N="257" REF="149">
they fetch'd their own Servants, and went to convey them out of the Lodge; which again was hindred by the Ambassador, who would first have the Goods weighed, and the Money told to them: He would moreover have a Receipt of them for so many several sorts of Commodities and Money for the use of the <HI>Batavian Chineses,</HI> which the <HI>Mandarins</HI> after having look'd them over per|form'd, and then went away with them.</P>
<P>These Goods taken away by force, and the General's Order, it was thought convenient to Copy out the Receipt signed by the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> and carry it the next Morning when <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Vander Does</HI> went to the Vice-Roy, to the Ge|neral, and to tell him that the <HI>Mandarins, Liu</HI> and <HI>Liu-lavja,</HI> had by his Order taken the Goods out of the Lodge, of whose number and quantity they had, according to the <HI>Mandarins</HI> Receipt, brought him an account and Copy, that if the Goods hereafter should be diminished, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> might be blame|less.</P>
<P>The sixteenth in the Morning <HI>Nobel</HI> and the Secretary went to the Vice-Roy<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Vander Does</HI> come to the Vice-Roy.</NOTE> <HI>Singlamong,</HI> to speak with him about the Ship; before whom after a little stay they were brought to have Audience. After he had, according to the <HI>Tartars</HI> Custom, inquir'd of the Ambassador's Health, <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Vander Does</HI> told him the occasion of their coming, <HI>viz.</HI> That the next day a Ship must go to <HI>Batavia.</HI> To which at first he said nothing else, but that they must speak with <HI>Talavja</HI> about it, till which time they must defer her going. Whereupon the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> told him, that the Ship must upon necessity go to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and her going could not be put off any longer, because, according to the Lord <HI>Maetzuiker</HI>'s Order to the Ambassador, the Ship should have been gone two Moneths sooner, to carry news of their safe arrival, and what they had done in the Trade&punc; and that the Ambassador was to take his Journey to <HI>Peking</HI> in four or five days, at which the Lord General would be highly pleas'd. To which the Vice-Roy reply'd, That they might let the Ship go away privately without telling any Person of it, and make themselves ready for their Jour|ney; which done the Vice-Roy would impart something to them. More|ver his earnest Request was, That nothing might be writ to <HI>Batavia</HI> of what had hitherto hapned.</P>
<P>From thence <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Harthouwer</HI> went to the General, that according to<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Harthouwer</HI> go to the General.</NOTE> yesterdays Resolution they might shew him the Receipt for the <HI>Chinese</HI> Goods; but before they went thither they sent a Soldier to the Ambassador, to tell him the Vice-Roy's Answer. Coming to the General's they were forc'd to stay a considerable time before any Person came to them; yet at last one pas|sing by, they took occasion to send notice of their attendance: who brought them answer, That he knew of the fetching of the Goods by the <HI>Mandarins, Liu</HI> and <HI>Liu-lavja,</HI> in which they had done very well; and withall that he was busie about his Offerings, therefore could not grant them Audience, which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cannot be admitted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> have Audience.</NOTE> made them not deliver the Receipt, but return home.</P>
<P><HI>Van Hoorn</HI> being inform'd of the Vice-Roy's Answer about the Ship, re|turn'd, being on his Way going to <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s prime Factor, who had invited him to a Feast and <HI>Wayang,</HI> or Play, in Person to send away the <HI>Vlaerdings</HI> Boat, which waited onely for order when the fore-mention'd Ship should set Sail. To which purpose he wrote a Letter to Captain <HI>Vander Werf,</HI> That the Vice-Roy had at last consented that he might set Sail with his Ship, therefore he should put to Sea with as much silence as he could, without looking for any thing.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="150">The <HI>Indian</HI> Council at <HI>Batavia</HI> seem'd much concern'd to hear News of the Ambassador's success in <HI>China;</HI> whom at his coming from thence they had commanded, that he should endeavor from <HI>Peking</HI> by <HI>Moskou,</HI> if it were pos|sible, to send advice to the <HI>States</HI> of <HI>Holland.</HI> Therefore it was judg'd conveni|ent on the fourth to send with the <HI>Vlaerding</HI> (for because of the Differences be|tween the Governors Factors and the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> about the receiving of the Goods and delivering of Silks, they had lost their hopes of sending the <HI>Tyger</HI> time enough to <HI>Batavia,</HI> that from thence she might Sail with the last Ships<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letters sent to <HI>Holland.</HI></NOTE> that were bound for <HI>Holland</HI>) a Copy of the Letter written to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and sent by the <HI>Polesnip</HI> on the eleventh of <HI>October,</HI> that from <HI>Malacca</HI> it might be sent through <HI>Persia</HI> by Land to <HI>Holland:</HI> and likewise the Copies of the Letters which had been written were also sent to go thither with the <HI>Tyger.</HI> Besides which <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> also sent a Letter apart to the Lords before mention'd, which serv'd as a cover for all the other. The said Letters, though open, were sent to the Governors <HI>Balthazar Bort</HI> and <HI>Paviljon,</HI> with Orders to send them away with all speed. <HI>Bort</HI> was also commanded, that if an opportunity did present it self there, to send Copies of those Letters that were directed for <HI>Holland,</HI> to the <HI>Indian</HI> Council at <HI>Batavia.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Van Hoorn</HI> Dines with the chief Factor.</NOTE></P>
<P>After the Boat was sent away with the fore-mention'd Letters, <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> went again to the chief Factors House, where he was nobly entertain'd. At their departure <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Harthouwer</HI> led the Factor into a private Room, and ask'd him if he would let them have any other Silk? which he much scrupled at, fearing lest it might be discover'd; yet if they would faithfully promise not to speak of any such thing, or make mention thereof at <HI>Peking,</HI> he would deliver them some: which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> on the other side as much scrupling, they broke off farther Discourse, and so parted.</P>
<P>The next Morning they went again to the Factor about the same Business, and told him, That before their Journey to <HI>Peking</HI> the <HI>Hopou</HI> must make all things even; that the <HI>Tyger</HI> being unladen, must go again to <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven; and the <HI>Alphen</HI> would also be suddenly deliver'd, therefore they must now ei|ther receive Money or Silks to divide and lade into the Ships. Moreover, as they pass'd by they call'd at the Vice-Roy's, and ask'd him when his Highness would be at leisure to permit the Ambassador to come and confer with him about his addressing himself to the Court. Whereupon the prime Factor seem|ing to be somewhat dissatisfi'd, ask'd if ever they remain'd in their debt, that the <HI>Hopou</HI> should so much press their setling and making even of Accounts be|fore he went to <HI>Peking,</HI> with many other Discourses to the like purpose; yet at last promis'd they should have Money the next Morning, it lying ready for them: with this Answer the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> took their leave; and as they pass'd by went to the Vice-Roy's Court, who sent them word that the Ambassador might within two days come and speak with him about the Embassy.</P>
<P>Mean while two <HI>Mandarins</HI> came to the Lodge to tell the Ambassador from the General, That he must make himself ready for his departure at farthest in seven days, demanding a List of the Names of the Persons, and number of the Packs, Chests, and other things that were to go with him; which immediately was deliver'd to them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ambassador re|ceives order to go his Journey.</NOTE></P>
<P>The eighteenth two <HI>Mandarins</HI> came to the Lodge, to ask the Ambassador why he did not set forth on the twentieth of their Moon?

Sail. Then the <HI>Mandarins</HI> reply'd, The Generals do give leave that three Ships may depart, and also that the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> might fall down; wherefore they must prepare for their Journey, because the General was not satisfi'd that they stay'd so long. Neither did the <HI>Hollanders</HI> stay after these good tydings, but immediately Shipp'd off all their Goods, and prepar'd to begin their Voyage.</P>
<P>In the Morning, being the nineteenth, four <HI>Mandarins</HI> came to the Lodge, two sent from the General, and two from the Vice-Roy, to drink to the Am|bassador's health and good success in their Journey, and at <HI>Peking</HI> also, inform|ing them how they should carry themselves there: and also two Interpreters, <HI>Ienko</HI> and <HI>Liulako,</HI> which came with the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> being sent by their High|nesses to observe the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Transactions; nay, they were to do nothing without their advice, because they knew the Custom of the Countrey, and al|so what was best to be done, or otherwise. The <HI>Netherlanders</HI> willing to be led by them, answer'd, That they would endeavor in all things to give the Vice-Roy and General satisfaction: Whereupon the <HI>Mandarins</HI> took their leave, being Presented each of them with a Piece of Crown Serge.</P>
<P>The Merchant <HI>Harthouwer</HI> had a written Order given him, according to which he was to govern himself during the Ambassador's absence, and like|wise the Names and numbers of the Persons that were to stay with him in <HI>Hoksieu.</HI></P>
<P>The twentieth in the Morning, after all their Goods and Necessaries were<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leave <HI>Hoksieu.</HI></NOTE> Shipp'd in thirty eight Barques, they went away with the Flood, and came about Noon to <HI>Hoksantiouw</HI> Bridge, two Leagues distant from <HI>Lamthay,</HI> the Suburbs of <HI>Hoksieu;</HI> where they found the Vessels, with their <HI>Mandarin</HI> and Guides lying at Anchor. Here the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were forc'd to stay till all their Barques came thither. <HI>Harthouwer</HI> and some other Persons which had accom|panied the Ambassador to this Place, return'd in the Evening.</P>
<P>They were no sooner gone, but several <HI>Mandarins</HI> came to ask the <HI>Nether|landers</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">But twenty four <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> are suffer'd to go to <HI>Peking.</HI></NOTE> how many their Train consisted of, being two and thirty, whereof five were <HI>Negro</HI> Boys. To which they reply'd, That neither the Vice-Roy nor General would suffer above twenty four Persons in all to go, because it was written to the Emperor so many should come.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon about four a Clock the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> being twenty four in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambassador proceeds on his Journey.</NOTE> number, that belong'd to several Offices, went at the Flood with about fifty Barques Westerly up the River <HI>Min&punc;</HI> and came in the Evening about seven a Clock to an Isle, lying about a Cannon-shot from the Village call'd <HI>Unwono,</HI> where they stay'd that Night, being got a League to the Westward.</P>
<P>The two and twentieth at Day-break they set Sail again, and about nine a Clock pass'd <HI>Howtong,</HI> a Village lying on the right-side of the River, In the Af|ternoon they Sail'd by <HI>Petjong, Hongia,</HI> and <HI>Tiksoya</HI> on the same Shore; they came in the Dusk of the Evening before <HI>Congimon,</HI> having that day by Rowing and Sailing gotten five Leagues more to the Westward.</P>
<P>All the fore-mention'd Villages were thick built with Houses, that were lit|tle better than our Huts or Hovels, but the adjacent Fields abounding with Rice and store of other Grain.</P>
<P>The three and twentieth in the Morning they proceeded, (the Wind still favoring them) and about nine a Clock pass'd by <HI>Binkin,</HI> a Village by some call'd <HI>Mincing,</HI> three Leagues from <HI>Congimon,</HI> standing behind a Hill a little up in the Countrey, on the left-side of the River <HI>Min.</HI></P>
<P>This Town is adorn'd with fair Buildings, and a high Steeple, which ap|pears
<PB N="260" REF="153">
with its Spiry top above the Mountain, and seen by all those that pass by it.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon they had in view <HI>Anike, Siaivang,</HI> and <HI>Twavigh;</HI> the first of which Towns lies on the right, and the other two on the left Hand, the last being about three Leagues from <HI>Binkin:</HI> at four after Noon they arriv'd at <HI>Chukaw,</HI> where they rested that Night, to get <HI>Coelies</HI> to Tow their Boats, because the Stream ran very slack, having that day made six Leagues and a half more Westerly.</P>
<P>The Verges of the River here are nothing but hilly and barren Cliffs.</P>
<P>The twenty fourth in the Morning, the Wind at North-East, they got two <HI>Coelies</HI> for every Vessel, and going on their Journey about eight a Clock pass'd by <HI>Caukawa,</HI> a Village on the left side of the River, a League from <HI>Chukaw,</HI> and in the Evening Landed at <HI>Poutcham,</HI> where they saw some decay'd Houses, ha|ving that day gain'd, though with no small danger of Rocks and strong Water-falls, three Leagues.</P>
<P>The next Morning, being the twenty fifth, they left <HI>Poutcham,</HI> and about two a Clock in the Afternoon pass'd by <HI>Tiongopan</HI> and <HI>Iunchiam,</HI> both lying on the left side of the River, the last being two Leagues distant from <HI>Poutcham;</HI> and in the Evening they came over against <HI>Ukekaun</HI> near a Watch-house, ha|ving not gotten above three Leagues all that day, because of the Sholes and contrary Current.</P>
<P>The twenty sixth in the Morning putting forward, they were drawn up over Sholes and Rocks, which by the violent Precipes and fall of the Stream seem'd very dreadful, and not without imminent danger, as appear'd by the Barque in which the Comptroller <HI>Ruwenort</HI> was, which Rowing about as they suppos'd for advantage, ran on a Rock and sunk immediately; yet most of the Goods were sav'd, though we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">. In the Afternoon they reach'd <HI>Kantang</HI> and <HI>Poinpang,</HI> Villages standing on the right side going up, and in the Evening Landed near a Watch-house call'd <HI>Bokkay;</HI> where they reposed that Night, ha|ving gone but two Leagues and a half that day, and with great trouble.</P>
<P>The twenty seventh about Day-break they weigh'd, and before Noon saw several Priests Houses and Hamlets, built on the hangings or declivings of the Mountains, and in the Afternoon about four a Clock they came to <HI>Seghia</HI> and <HI>Siong,</HI> two Villages opposite one to the other, about two Leagues from <HI>Bokkay;</HI> from whence passing on they arriv'd at another Watch-house call'd <HI>Soujong,</HI> where they stay'd the following Night, having with great danger got|ten two Leagues and a half to the West.</P>
<P>The twenty eighth in the Morning they came between two great Towers about nine a Clock, each standing on a Summit fronting the other on the side of the River; behind which appears the City <HI>Iemping,</HI> or <HI>Ienping,</HI> or <HI>Ienpingsoe.</HI> The Ambassador passing through the Bridge, was by two <HI>Mandarins,</HI> sent from the General of that Place, call'd <HI>Sioubontok,</HI> invited to Dinner to his Palace; whither he went with some of his Attendants: So soon as he came with his Barque to one of the City Gates, he was kindly receiv'd by <HI>Sioubontok,</HI> and nobly Entertain'd after the <HI>Chinese</HI> manner with variety of Dishes, and several Entries of their <HI>Wayangs,</HI> or Stage-plays.</P>
<P>No Discourse of any concern hapned here, onely <HI>Sioubontok</HI> ask'd if the <HI>Ne|therlanders</HI> had <HI>Quelang?</HI> and how many Men kept the Place? Which the Am|bassador answering according, and taking his leave, went in the Evening Aboard; where they sound some fresh Provisions, sent thither by the General's Order,
<PB N="261" REF="153">
consisting in Oxen, Swine, Hens, Ducks, and Herbs, for which the Beaters receiv'd five Crowns of Silver; and the Ambassador, according to the Custom of the Countrey, gave the <HI>Wayang</HI> Actors, and also the Servants that attended him at the Table, five Dollars apiece.</P>
<P>In the Evening <HI>Sioubontok</HI> came in Person Aboard, and a little after the Go|vernor of the City, being a comely proper Man, with a long Beard, Habited after the <HI>Chinese</HI> manner in Mourning for a deceased Relation, both welcom|ing the Ambassador and <HI>Haulavia</HI> the <HI>Mandarin</HI> that was sent with him as his Guide, who would not come to <HI>Sioubontok</HI>'s Feast, though invited several times. After the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> had given them a taste of their <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine, and they view'd the Horses and Oxen, and <HI>Sandal</HI> Wood that were to be presented to the Emperor, they took their leave and walk'd to their several Houses in the Dusk of the Evening. <HI>Sioubontok</HI> after his departure sent the Ambassador some Geese, and six <HI>Picol</HI> of Rice. After which he sent the Interpreter <HI>Maurice Iansz Vis,</HI> to the General <HI>Sioubontok,</HI> to enquire how the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> Business stood at <HI>Peking,</HI> because <HI>Maurice</HI> was very familiar with him, having been his Servant when he was a Prisoner amongst the <HI>Chineses. Maurice</HI> at his coming back brought word from <HI>Sioubontok,</HI> That the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were in great esteem at Court, and that he doubted not but they would obtain what ever they desir'd: but there were some great Persons at <HI>Peking</HI> which they must seek to please and get their favor, by which they need not doubt to have all their Requests grant|ed. Moreover he desir'd <HI>Maurice</HI> to entreat the Ambassador in his behalf, that when the Emperor should chance to speak with him about the conquering of <HI>Tayowan,</HI> (which without doubt he would do) that he would please to speak in his behalf, that he might go with them to the subduing of the Place, because he had a Wife and Children, and several Goods there.</P>
<P>The twenty ninth in the Morning, <HI>Sioubontok</HI> sent more fresh Provisions, as Poultrey, Swine, Sallet Herbs, and Provender for the Horses; for all which the Secretary <HI>Vander Does</HI> went and presented him in the Ambassadors Name with a Fowling-piece, a Pair of Pistols, a Couple of Knives, a Chain of Amber Beads, one Piece of Amber weighing ten Ounces, ten <HI>Dutch</HI> Ells of fine Cloth, and likewise an Inventory of the Presents design'd for him, which if he would not accept now, he might receive them at the Ambassador's Return. The Se|cretary was also commanded to desire <HI>Sioubontok</HI> to instruct the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> how they should carry themselves to the four <HI>Zoetaysings</HI> which he had spoken of to the Interpreter <HI>Maurice,</HI> and likewise inform them of some other Lords that might assist them in their Business in <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>The Secretary at his Return related, That he had shewn <HI>Sioubontok</HI> the In|ventory of his Presents, who said he would receive them with many thanks; proffering moreover his Service to assist the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in what ever they pleas'd to desire of him. After some Discourse the Secretary ask'd him concerning the four <HI>Zoetaysings,</HI> or <HI>Great Men,</HI> and what Lords they were best to address themselves to in <HI>Peking?</HI> Whereupon commanding all his Attendants to avoid the Presence, he reply'd, That when the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> came to <HI>Peking,</HI> they must endeavor to gain the four chief Councellors, or <HI>Zoetaysings</HI> favor, (who during the Emperor's Minority were Guardians, or Protectors of the Empire) which was very easily be done, if they did but employ some faithful Persons to intercede for them, and in their Name Present them with Money and Gifts, which they loved very well: To which purpose, that he might assist them, he would send a Letter with them to <HI>Peking,</HI> to a certain <HI>Mandarin</HI> which was in
<PB N="262" REF="154">
great Repute there, and was formerly one of his Deputies, who would on his Recommendation be very serviceable to them; and that he had also Presented some prime Councellors each with a <HI>Negro</HI> Boy, which were also his Friends, and would aid the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in their Business; They should not repose too much confidence in the Proffers of several Persons pretending to belong to the Court; for many cunning Villains would come and perswade them to be|lieve that they were such and such great Lords which they were not, as he himself had found when there in Person, therefore they ought to have a great care that their Followers were not talkative, which might prove a great disad|vantage to their Business: but if they could get into the four Councellors of States favor, they could but ask and have; for what-ever they requested would certainly be granted them. There are also (said he) several Officers belong|ing to the Councel, to which he would recommend them and their Business. Whereupon the Secretary taking his leave, thanked him for his good advice, and so went Aboard.</P>
<P>The Presents design'd for <HI>Sioubontok</HI> being brought to Land, though not without some difficulty, were by Captain <HI>Putmans</HI> carry'd to him, who sent the Ambassador twenty Pieces of Stuff for the Clothing of his Retinue, and some Fruits, in return for them; whereupon the Stuffs were immediately distribu|ted amongst the Men.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon <HI>Lunlakko</HI> the Interpreter brought the Ambassador from his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambassadors Expences.</NOTE> <HI>Mandarin</HI> twelve Pieces of <HI>Chinese</HI> Boat-Silver, to bear his Expences, telling him it was by the Emperor's order; and also that the Ambassador was at such Places to have twelve <HI>Condarins,</HI> or fifteen <HI>Stuivers; Nobel,</HI> fourteen <HI>Condarins,</HI> or twelve <HI>Stuivers; Putmans,</HI> twelve <HI>Condarins,</HI> or ten <HI>Stuivers;</HI> all which Money it was thought fit to refuse: but because the <HI>Mandarins</HI> and Interpreters durst not receive it again, saying, That what the Emperor had commanded must be obey'd; and if they would not accept of it, they might keep it and return it in <HI>Peking:</HI> Whereupon it was deliver'd to the Comptroller <HI>Ruwenoort</HI> to keep till they came thither.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Ienping,</HI> or <HI>Ienpingfoe,</HI> the next to the prime City, or Metropolis of<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City <HI>Ienping.</HI></NOTE> the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> lies at the going up of the Stream on the right Hand, or on the Westerly Shore of the River <HI>Min;</HI> from whence it maketh a handsom Prospect on the side of a Hill, the Edifices rising gently by degrees.</P>
<P>This Mountain is for the most part inaccessible, making the City rather a Fortress, and to be esteem'd as the Key of the whole Province.</P>
<P>The City is a League long, but not above a Mile and a half broad, full of fair and large Buildings. Every House is furnish'd with Water convey'd from the Mountains in Cane Pipes, the like not elsewhere to be seen in <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>All Provisions are to be had there in great abundance, and at a cheap Rate; the Streets and Houses also throng'd with Inhabitants.</P>
<P>On the East side of the City two great Rivers, the <HI>Min</HI> and <HI>Zi,</HI> uniting their Waters, make a great Lake; through which Ships come thither from all parts of the adjacent Countrey. Each of these Rivers hath a fair Bridge; and in the City are three beautiful Temples.</P>
<P>Most of the course <HI>China</HI> Paper is made here; but the whitest and finest sort in a Village call'd <HI>Siege,</HI> three Leagues beyond more Westerly, which is all that is there of remark; onely this City boasts that her Inhabitants speak the most elegant Phrase of all the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and therefore it is call'd the <HI>Man|darins,</HI> or <HI>Court Language.</HI></P>

<P>That Night the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> lay a little from the City near the opposite Shore; from whence they Row'd and set Sail the thirtieth in the Morning to <HI>Honjong,</HI> a Village about a League from <HI>Ienping,</HI> where all their Fleet Rendez|vouz'd, having had a narrow and dangerous Passage thither. Hence they set Sail again about nine a Clock, and in the Afternoon&punc; pass'd by <HI>Louquon, Hoeyong, Linkentome,</HI> and <HI>Tafa;</HI> the two first of which lie on the right, and the two last on the left side of the River, about half a League distant one from another.</P>
<P>In the Evening they anchor'd before <HI>Ongsoutow,</HI> having that day gain'd three Leagues in a Northerly Course.</P>
<P>The one and thirtieth in the Morning setting Sail again, they pass'd by a long Village call'd <HI>Bonsjouko</HI> about eight a Clock, and at ten by the Village <HI>Liucuir, Posjen,</HI> and <HI>Ubaka;</HI> the first and last on the right side, and the second on the left.</P>
<P>In <HI>Ubaka</HI> much Paper is made, which appear'd by several Vessels that lay Freighted onely with such Goods to go up the River.</P>
<P>About Noon they saw <HI>Konchian, Sioeukke,</HI> and <HI>Tayping;</HI> the two first on the right, and the third on the left side of the Stream, close by one another.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon about three a Clock they came to <HI>Chiakiang,</HI> where they Rode till the next day.</P>
<P>The next Morning, being the first of <HI>February,</HI> they set Sail again, and in<NOTE PLACE="marg">February.</NOTE> the Afternoon pass'd by five Villages, <HI>viz. Siejokaun, Itantauw, Bayapo, Siema,</HI> and <HI>Filictauw;</HI> the two first lying on the right, and the two last on the left side of the River; and about Noon they arriv'd at the City of <HI>Kienning,</HI> or <HI>Kienning|foe,</HI> where the Horses were immediately put ashore, because the Barques in which they came were judg'd too big to carry them up any higher; but not getting any smaller that day, they were set up till the next Morning.</P>
<P>Here the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> had the Gates shut against them, being not permitted to enter the City; so that they were not able to get any fresh Provisions; nay, none were suffer'd to sell any thing to the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> without the Interpre|ters

leave, who acted as Comptrollers where-ever they came, and especially <HI>Ienko,</HI> as appear'd by a Soldier that belong'd to <HI>Sioubontok,</HI> General of the City&punc; <HI>Ienping;</HI> who having bought some Fruit for the Ambassador, and bringing it to him, was, so soon as the Interpreters were inform'd of it, taken by the <HI>Mandarins</HI> Order, and ty'd Neck and Heels together, and had not the Ambassa|dor interceded for him, they had sent him a Prisoner to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> where he would have been severely punish'd; but the Ambassador at last prevail'd so much that he was set at liberty.</P>
<P>The second, after the Vessels were prepar'd to carry the Horses, they were immediately imbarqu'd again, and all safely put Aboard; the <HI>Tartars</HI> being highly pleas'd with them, had dress'd them so neatly, that they were slick as Glass.</P>
<P>In the Evening the <HI>Mandarins</HI> which were the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> Guides, presented them with some boyl'd and roasted Meats.</P>
<P>Thus having gotten all things in a readiness, they left the City <HI>Kienningfoe</HI> on the third, the Governors thereof being so surly, that they not once bid the Ambassador welcom, or wish'd him a good Journey at his going from thence, nor presented him with the least Provision, which no way grieved them, who by that means kept their Chests lock'd.</P>
<P>This <HI>Kienningfoe</HI> being the fourth, and so one of the most eminent Cities in<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City <HI>Kienningfoe.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Fokien,</HI> lying on the Eastern Shore of the River <HI>Min,</HI> is something inferior in Beauty and Riches, but not in bigness to the Metropolis <HI>Focheu,</HI> and larger than <HI>Ienping,</HI> but not so close built, because several Corn-Fields are inclos'd within her Walls. The Streets are all Pav'd with Pebble, and very full of In|habitants, that drive no other Trade but making of course Paper. They are Rul'd by two Governors, which sway alternately, the one not so much as once daring to contradict the other in his time.</P>
<P><HI>China</HI> affords several sorts of Paper, made of several Materials, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Body and Leaves of Cane-tree, Cotton, Silk, and Flaxen Clothes: that which is made of Cotton is not altogether so white as our <HI>French</HI> Paper.</P>
<P>In the County of <HI>Vuchaufu,</HI> belonging to the Countrey of <HI>Huquang:</HI> They make also great quantities of Paper, of the Canes and Leaves, which grow there in great abundance.</P>
<P>In the Forenoon having left <HI>Kienningfoe,</HI> they pass'd by <HI>Gaetchan, Maschetany,</HI> and <HI>Petchin,</HI> Villages lying close together on the left side of the River; the last lying about a League from <HI>Kienningfoe.</HI> In the Afternoon they saw by the Village <HI>Kekau, Vazoeo</HI> and <HI>Gautauw;</HI> the two first on the right, and the last on the left side of the River. Towards Evening they came before, and Landed at a ruin'd and decay'd Village call'd <HI>Chiaphong,</HI> where they remain'd all Night. Here they directed their Course almost North, having a little of the West.</P>
<P>The next Morning, being the fourth, leaving <HI>Chiaphong,</HI> they pass'd by <HI>Chincheuw,</HI> seated on the right side of the River, a League from <HI>Chiaphong;</HI> and in the Afternoon by several Hamlets, Houses and <HI>Pagodes,</HI> that stood here and there apart from the rest, along the Margents of the River. In the Evening they arriv'd at a ruinous Town call'd <HI>Sjovova,</HI> on the right side of the River, having that day gain'd but two Leagues with great trouble.</P>
<P>The fifth in the Morning setting Sail again, they left the Villages <HI>Tachoe</HI> and <HI>Pagou</HI> on their left hand, and in the Afternoon pass'd by <HI>Swinckin,</HI> situate on their right hand; and arriving at <HI>Suchiap</HI> about three a Clock they Landed, ha|ving that day gain'd two Leagues and a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>

<P>The sixth in the Morning leaving <HI>Sichiap</HI> (where they had chang'd their <HI>Coelies,</HI> or <HI>Pugs,</HI> for the Towing forward of their Vessels,) they pass'd by <HI>Tin|tenna, Cholunga,</HI> and <HI>Leantong,</HI> three Villages seated on the right hand. In the Afternoon they ran by the Villages <HI>Losjouwa</HI> and <HI>Sichem,</HI> built on the same side; and towards Evening anchor'd opposite to the Village <HI>Hochiechien,</HI> having gain'd three Leagues that day.</P>
<P>The seventh proceeding on their Journey, they pass'd <HI>Hoesuna</HI> and <HI>Nagan,</HI> and at Noon arriv'd at <HI>Quiquan;</HI> where they stay'd for the Vessels that brought the Horses, which by reason of the shallow Water could not get up the River so fast; but at last arriving, the Masters of them complain'd, that by drawing over the Sands they were grown very leaky, and that it was impossible to go any further with them before they were mended and trimm'd up a new; for which cause it was judg'd convenient to put the Horses ashore, and send them by Land to <HI>Poutchin,</HI> by others call'd <HI>Puchin,</HI> a good Town not above five Leagues from <HI>Quiquan.</HI> The Horses being got safe ashore were set up till next Morning. The Comptroller <HI>Ruwenoort,</HI> Interpreter <HI>Maurice,</HI> and the four Grooms, were order'd to Ride them thither; and also twelve <HI>Chinese</HI> Sol|diers by order of their <HI>Mandarins</HI> were sent to conduct them. That Night the Vessels lay at Anchor before <HI>Quiquan.</HI></P>
<P>The eighth they left <HI>Quiquan</HI> at Day-break, and about Noon pass'd by the Village <HI>Souswenna,</HI> standing on the left hand: soon after they got sight of a great&punc; Town call'd <HI>Swipia,</HI> near which appear'd several ruin'd Houses, and also a large, but broken and decay'd Stone Bridge; and about four a Clock they came before <HI>Chintewa,</HI> a Village lying on their left hand, a Mile from <HI>Swipia,</HI> and towards Evening dropt Anchor near a Watch-Tower, about which were built a few Houses, having that day with great danger gain'd three Leagues.</P>
<P>The ninth in the Morning weighing, they pass'd by two Villages call'd <HI>Gotanga</HI> and <HI>Quotinha,</HI> the first lying on the right, and the second on the left hand: at Noon they saw a Temple, which being built over a Moat, or Sluce
<PB N="266" REF="161">
like a Bridge, under which at High-water Vessels might pass, was round about adorn'd, after the <HI>Chinese</HI> manner, with Imagery, to which they ascended by a pair of Stairs rais'd on one side of it. After Noon they pass'd <HI>Saloekia,</HI> and se|veral other Places ruin'd in the last War, onely some Pieces of Walls remain|ing. The Night approaching, they cast Anchor before a Sandy Plain, about a League from <HI>Poutchinfoe,</HI> having with much ado that day gain'd three Leagues.</P>
<P>The tenth in the Morning they set Sail about eight a Clock through a bro|ken Bridge, formerly laid cross the River, and about Noon came to <HI>Poutchin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The City <HI>Poutchin.</HI></NOTE> the fourth eminentest City belonging to <HI>Kienningfoe.</HI> Here the Comptroller <HI>Ru|wenoort</HI> came to the Ambassador, to tell him that the Horses came safely thither the last Night, and were put into a Stable joyn'd to the House, prepar'd for them to stay in, till the <HI>Coelies</HI> were come to carry the Emperor's Presents. The Ambassador commanded the Secretary to ask the <HI>Mandarins</HI> that were come with him, because the Houses prepar'd for him and his Attendants were very old and rotten, and scarce fit to Lodge in, if he might stay so long in the Barques till such time as the <HI>Coelies</HI> were come up, and they ready to go far|ther. But the <HI>Mandarins</HI> said that it could not be, because all the Goods must be taken an account of, that they might see how many <HI>Coelies</HI> they should want to carry them. Whereupon they found it convenient to Land all their Goods the next Morning, and put the Oxen ashore that Afternoon. In the Evening the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were presented with some fresh Provisions, by some <HI>Mandarins</HI> belonging to the <HI>Conbon</HI> of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and likewise by their <HI>Mandarine</HI> Guides; for which <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> (they having presented him several times before) gave them a small Piece of Plate.</P>
<P>The eleventh in the Morning all the Presents were unladen and carry'd to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Presents Landed&punc;</NOTE> the House prepared for that purpose, which was not onely very old, but of no convenience, the Rooms being so bad and so few, seeming rather a Hog|stye than a Dwelling-house: but they no way able to better themselves were forc'd to be contented. In the Evening order was given to watch the Goods, because they were constrain'd to lie in open Places, incident to filching Pilfer|ers. Every Person was also strictly commanded not to stir abroad without the Ambassador's leave, thereby to shew the <HI>Chineses,</HI> who had forbid the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> from going into the City, that they did not value it, there being nothing to do for them.</P>
<P>The thirteenth the chief of the <HI>Coelies,</HI> as the <HI>Mandarins</HI> their Guides inform'd the Ambassador, came to his Lodging to take an account of the number of the Chests and Packs, and to see how many <HI>Coelies</HI> would be requisite to carry them: after the weight and number were written down, they found that they should want six hundred <HI>Coelies</HI> for the carrying of the Presents and other Goods.</P>
<P>The fourteenth in the Morning both the <HI>Mandarins</HI> came again, with <HI>Ienko</HI> and <HI>Liu-lako</HI> the Interpreters, to the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> in their Lodging, to tell them that the number of the <HI>Coelies</HI> for the carrying of the Goods far exceeded the number express'd in their Warrant given them by the General, because onely two Persons were allow'd for the carrying of a Pack or Case, whereas now there were several amongst them which two Men were not able to carry, and thereupon would want two hundred Porters: and moreover, that the <HI>Manda|rins</HI> of the City durst not do contrary to the General's Order; in allowing them more <HI>Coelies</HI> than was express'd in their Warrant. Whereupon <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> reply'd,
<PB N="267" REF="161">
That if the <HI>Hopou</HI> and <HI>Pimpous</HI> in <HI>Peking</HI> had given such Order, it was well: Moreover, he would pay for the Carriage of what was over and above that which was mention'd in the Pass; and that it seem'd strange to him, since in <HI>Hoksieu</HI> the number of the Cases and Packs that belong'd to the Embassy were deliver'd in Writing to the General's Officers, which had seen them, and might well have discern'd that there were several Chests amongst them which could not be carry'd by two Men: but it was no great matter, for if they got no <HI>Coe|lies</HI> they were the less obliged: Nay, he knew the former Ambassadors never wanted Men to carry their Goods, and had also much more honor and respect shewn them than was done to him, never travelling through any Place but they were fetch'd in, and nobly entertain'd by the Governors thereof; whereas now on the contrary the Gates were shut up against him, and he forbid to come in|to the City. To which the <HI>Mandarins</HI> made no Reply.</P>
<P>Mean while the City <HI>Mandarin</HI> who commanded the <HI>Coelies,</HI> came in Person to the Ambassador; whereupon a Contest began between him and the <HI>Manda|rine</HI> Guides; which being no way pleasing to the Ambassador, he said that he would have no Quarrel about the Emperor's and his Goods, for he would pay those <HI>Coelies</HI> which were wanting above the number express'd in the General's Warrant: Whereupon as many <HI>Coelies</HI> were provided as they wanted; and the Ambassador wrote a Letter to the General in <HI>Hoksieu</HI> to this effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THat the Ambassador would never forget the many great Favors which he receiv'd from his Highness in <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and doth not doubt but that he will continue the same: In return whereof, he desires that <HI>Talavja</HI> might be assur'd, that neither in the Court at <HI>Peking,</HI> nor any other Place in the World, he would seek or do any thing to his disliking or disparagement. That himself hath well arriv'd at <HI>Chinkon</HI> in <HI>Pouchin,</HI> and finds that he wants more <HI>Coelies</HI> than are express'd in the <HI>Pay</HI> or Warrant granted him, whom if his Ex|cellency think fit, he will cause to be paid by the <HI>Hopou</HI> in <HI>Hoksieu.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>This Letter deliver'd to the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> the Ambassador ask'd when they should proceed on their Journey? to which they answer'd, Two days hence. Then he enquir'd if the Horses and Oxen might not be sent away before, be|cause the Oxen travell'd but slowly: which being granted, they prepar'd all things accordingly. But in the Evening a <HI>Chinese</HI> Secretary, call'd <HI>Sinko,</HI> said that the <HI>Mandarins</HI> caus'd Frames to be made to carry the Oxen, because it would be impossible for them to go over the Mountains: at which the Am|bassador seem'd very well satisfi'd, and accordingly put off their going.</P>
<P>In the Morning, being the sixteenth, <HI>Hiu-lavja,</HI> one of the <HI>Netherlanders Man|darine</HI> Guides came with the Frames for the Oxen to the Ambassador's Lodg|ings; who asking him when they should go from thence? reply'd, Two days hence: Then he desir'd to know the reason why they must stay so long, because the <HI>Mandarin</HI> had on the fourteenth Instant also told him, That he should go two days hence: Whereupon he said, That it was because the <HI>Coelies</HI> which they wanted above the number mention'd in the Pass granted by <HI>Talavja,</HI> was not yet allow'd by the City <HI>Mandarins,</HI> who had promis'd, that within two days all things should be ready, himself wishing that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were gone. To which the Ambassador reply'd, That he knew that the <HI>Lepous</HI> were some|what displeas'd about their so long tarrying at <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> being detain'd there by the Vice-Roy, therefore it would be very inconvenient to lose more time there; so that if the <HI>Lepous</HI> should chance to ask him about it in <HI>Peking,</HI> he
<PB N="268" REF="162">
could freely declare that it was not his, but the <HI>Mandarins</HI> fault, who made him wait for <HI>Coelies.</HI> Which Discourse prevail'd so much, that Porters were im|mediately sent to carry the <HI>Sandal</HI> Wood, with which they walk'd before, it being very troublesom for its length and heaviness to be got over the Moun|tains.</P>
<P>The eighth in the Morning an hundred <HI>Coelies</HI> came to the Ambassador's Lodging, to tie and pack up the Presents to be carry'd in Burthens, and to go with their Loads before with the Horses and Oxen; with which the Secretary <HI>Vander Does</HI> was also order'd to Travel before; the Ambassador, <HI>Nobel,</HI> and the rest intending to follow them in the Afternoon: but because one of the Horses had receiv'd a hurt on his Head above the left Eye, the Ambassador thought it convenient to stay a day or two longer in <HI>Poutchin,</HI> and to keep one Horse more besides the fore-mention'd, to see in that time what could be done to him, and then give order for his stay, or taking along with him. Whereupon the Se|cretary, with two Horses, the Oxen, and the hundred <HI>Coelies,</HI> with their Loads went before, <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Putmans</HI> being order'd to follow him in the Afternoon; but because the tying up of the Goods spent too much time, it was deferr'd till the next Morning.</P>
<P>The Horse being pretty well recover'd, the Ambassador went from <HI>Poutchin</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ambassador leaves <HI>Poutchin.</HI></NOTE> the one and twentieth in the Morning; and having travell'd half a League by the Village <HI>Olian,</HI> and in the Afternoon by <HI>Sisanly</HI> and <HI>Singan,</HI> and some <HI>Pa|godes</HI> or Temples, towards Evening came to <HI>Guliaen,</HI> where they reposed that Night.</P>
<P>The next day being Snowy and Rainy, they rested themselves in expectati|on of fair Weather.</P>
<P>The twenty third the Skye being pretty well clear'd, notwithstanding the Mountains were still cover'd with Snow, the Ambassador leaving <HI>Guliaen</HI> pro|ceeded on his Journey, and in the Morning pass'd over a high Hill, and so through <HI>Huysjounton, Hangsion, Outangay, Ontongne, Kieumoe,</HI> and <HI>Ousalinga;</HI> from whence they saw divers <HI>Pagodes</HI> built on the Declivings of several Mountains. In the Afternoon they travell'd in sight of the Villages <HI>Movana, Loutiatona, Go|linga, Longkia, Kiekova,</HI> and divers Hamlets and Temples, of which very many stand all along this Road; amongst whom they saw one on the top of the Mountain <HI>Liougtouw,</HI> and call'd by the same Name.</P>
<P>Here are the utmost Limits of the Province of <HI>Fokien</HI> and <HI>Chekiang,</HI> or <HI>Chet|chiang,</HI> between both which the foremention'd Temple stands; so that now leaving <HI>Fokien,</HI> they entred into that of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> and going on came towards the Evening to a Village call'd <HI>Limathova,</HI> having that day travell'd five Leagues, four in the Territory of <HI>Fokien,</HI> and one in that of <HI>Chekiang.</HI></P>
<P>This Province, though less than others, yet exceeds all the rest in fertility<NOTE PLACE="marg">Territory&punc; <HI>Chekiang.</HI></NOTE> of Soil, delightfulness of Prospects and Riches, beginning in the South under twenty seven Degrees and five Minutes Northern Latitude, and extending Northerly to thirty one Degrees and twenty five Minutes, a Tract of sixty five Leagues, the greatest breadth from East to West being almost of the same length.

<P>The chief Tract of Land call'd <HI>Hangcheufu,</HI> borders Northerly on <HI>Hucheufu,</HI> and <HI>Kianhingfu;</HI> in the East, at the River <HI>Chee,</HI> between <HI>Kianhingfu</HI> and <HI>Xao|hingfu;</HI> in the South, at <HI>Nienchufu;</HI> and in the West, at <HI>Nanking.</HI></P>
<P>In ancient times this County belong'd to the Vice-Roy of <HI>V.</HI> and was afterwards possess'd by the King of <HI>Cu,</HI> and by the Family of <HI>Chin</HI> nam'd <HI>Cien|tang:</HI> by the Emperor <HI>Sui</HI> it was first styl'd <HI>Hangcheu;</HI> by the Family <HI>Tang, Iuhang;</HI> by <HI>Sung, Lingan;</HI> but the <HI>Taimingian</HI> Family restor'd this Country to its old Name.</P>
<P>This Division contains eight Cities, of which <HI>Hancheu</HI> is the chiefest, the rest&punc; are <HI>Huining, Tiuquang, Inlang, Liugany, Yuum, Sinching,</HI> and <HI>Changhoa.</HI></P>
<P>The second County call'd <HI>Kiahingfu,</HI> every where water'd with Rivers and Lakes, borders in the East, upon the Sea; in the South, upon a part of the Ocean, and part of <HI>Hangcheufu;</HI> Westward at <HI>Hucheufu;</HI> and in the North, at <HI>Sucheufu</HI> and <HI>Sungkiangfu,</HI> the Territory of <HI>Nanking,</HI> and a part of the Lake call'd <HI>Tai.</HI></P>
<P>This Shire contains six Cities, <HI>viz. Kiahing, Kiaxeny, Hayeni, Pinghu, Cungte,</HI> and <HI>Tungchiang.</HI></P>
<P>The Metropolis <HI>Kiahing</HI> was formerly a small City, and subject to <HI>Sucheu;</HI> but growing in Riches and Greatness in the Reign of the <HI>Taimingian</HI> Family, it was made the Head City, or Metropolis, and chang'd its former Name <HI>Siucheu</HI> to <HI>Kiahing.</HI></P>
<P>The City <HI>Kiahang,</HI> being the most Northern of the whole Province, lies as if it were Moated about with Rivulets of Water, full of stately and well built Stru|ctures, flourishing with variety of its own Product, having in all Places Riches and Plenty. All the Streets of the City are Arch'd, under which they walk as in a <HI>Piatzo,</HI> or Exchange, free from Wind and Weather, and sheltred from Sun and Rain. Without the City are several Triumphal Arches erected; and on the West side near the River, in one peculiar Place which they Sail by with their Ships or Vessels, stand sixteen of these Arches in a Square, all built of Marble. Athwart the River stands a Bridge of Marble, with many Arches, seventy Paces long, and likewise a Tower thrusting forth towards the Skye, nine Pinacles or Spires. All the Shores without the City are wharfed with square Free-stone; of which also the lesser Bridges are made that lead over them: There are forty more fair Bridges leading to several parts of the City, besides a great many less, scarce to be numbred.</P>
<P>The third County being <HI>Hucheufu</HI> borders in the East with <HI>Kiahingfu;</HI> in the South, upon <HI>Hangcheufu;</HI> in the West, verges the Province of <HI>Nanking;</HI> in the North, at the Lake <HI>Tai.</HI></P>
<P>This was formerly a Kingdom of it self, and nominated <HI>Tung;</HI> which first was possess'd by King <HI>V.</HI> and afterwards by <HI>Ine,</HI> then by <HI>Cu.</HI></P>
<P>The Family <HI>Cyn</HI> gave this County and its Head City the Name of <HI>Uching;</HI> that of <HI>Tang</HI> call'd it <HI>Hucheu,</HI> that is, <HI>The City of the Lake,</HI> because of the neigh|boring Lake <HI>Tai;</HI> for <HI>Hu</HI> signifies a Lake, and <HI>Cheu</HI> a City: the Royal Line of <HI>Sung</HI> nam'd it <HI>Chaoking;</HI> but the <HI>Taimingian</HI> Family restor'd the old Name <HI>Hucheu.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="163">Here are five Temples, the chiefest of which stands within the City Walls: they were founded in honor of the five first Emperors.</P>
<P>This Division contains six Cities, <HI>viz. Hucheu, Changhing, Tecing, Hiaosung, Unkang,</HI> and <HI>Gankie. Hucheu</HI> is not onely the chief, but reckon'd one of the biggest, and flourishes in Trade and Riches: It is adorn'd with many beauti|ful and large Buildings.</P>

<P>This City <HI>Kinhoa</HI> was formerly very populous, and full of well built Edi|fices; but in the late <HI>Tartar</HI> War, in which they held out a considerable time, was in a manner buried in Ruines: yet nevertheless it is almost re-erected, and especially one Stone Bridge on the West side hath obtain'd its former lustre.</P>

It contains five Cities, <HI>viz. Kin|cheu, Lungyeu, Changxan, Kiangzan,</HI> and <HI>Kaihoa.</HI></P>
<P>The City <HI>Kincheu</HI> lies on the Eastern Shore of the River <HI>Changyo,</HI> three days Journey from <HI>Fokien,</HI> between steep and troublesom Mountains to pass over.</P>
<P><HI>Paulus Venetus</HI> calls this City <HI>Kugui,</HI> according to the <HI>Tartar</HI> pronunciation, (with whom he travell'd in an Embassy thither) who in stead of <HI>Cheu,</HI> say <HI>Gui,</HI> both Words signifying <HI>Great City;</HI> wherefore <HI>Paulus</HI> may easily have made <HI>Kugui</HI> to be <HI>Kuicheu.</HI></P>

The Bridges also over which they pass the River and Lake, are all built in the same manner, being very numerous. The Banks of the River, which extends it self to three days Journey, are on each side wharf'd and wall'd in with Stone of the Quarre: at the end of which appears a great Dam, that receives and keeps the Waters, which swelling to a convenient heighth, Vessels that come thither, are with little help floated over into another Stream.</P>
<P>This Current serves onely to bring small Vessels up to the City <HI>Ningpo,</HI> for the great ones go about by Sea.</P>
<P>Near this City are also many Triumphal Arches; for building of which they have ready accommodation, because the Quarres that serve all <HI>China</HI> are close by their Doors.</P>
<P>The ninth Division call'd <HI>Ningpofu,</HI> borders in the East with the Sea; in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Borders.</NOTE> West, with <HI>Xaochingfu;</HI> South, upon a River flowing between this and the County <HI>Tancheufu.</HI></P>

<P>The Metropolis <HI>Ningpo,</HI> situated close by the River <HI>In,</HI> boasts store of hand|som Buildings.

<P>The whole Province of <HI>Chekiang</HI> is every where cut through with Rivers, Rivulets, and murmuring Streams, some brought in by Art, others of their own accord.</P>

The Grandees often take these Fishes with their own Hands, which in their presence (as if they knew who was their Lord, and what a pleasure they did to their owners, by sometimes shewing themselves) often play, and leap up and down above the Water.

<P>In the County of <HI>Chucheufu,</HI> near the City <HI>Kingning,</HI> grow great Thickets of Canes and Rushes in the River <HI>Lupeu,</HI> by the <HI>Chineses</HI> with a general name call'd <HI>Che,</HI> (for there are several sorts of them) and by the <HI>Indians, Mambu,</HI> which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> have turn'd to <HI>Bambu,</HI> and the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> to <HI>Bamboes.</HI> There also grows in most places all manner of Herbage and Grain, and in the County of <HI>Kinhoafu</HI> many great Plums, which they Transport to other parts.</P>
<P>In the seventh Shire, being <HI>Chucheufu</HI> are many Woods and Wildernesses of Pine-Trees, whence the <HI>Chineses</HI> have their Timber for the Building of Houses and Ships: They say, that near the City <HI>Sunghiang,</HI> that is, <HI>Earth of Pine,</HI> there are such thick ones found, that eighty Men cannot Fathom; nay, some whose hollow Wombs contain thirty or forty Men.</P>
<P>In the County of <HI>Ninchufu,</HI> their Hills produce store of Copper Mines.</P>
<P>In <HI>Kinhoafu,</HI> they make the best Drink that is in all <HI>China</HI> of Rice and Water; and in the same place are also the chiefest Gammons of Bacon, which bear a great esteem through all the Empire. There is likewise a sort of Gum, in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Cie,</HI> or <HI>Cia;</HI> and in the <HI>Portuguese, Cairo,</HI> which drops out of the Trees, and is very like Turpentine; the <HI>Chineses</HI> gather and colour it how they please, the best bears a Gold colour, and the next to that Black; be|fore it is quite dry, it yields an infectious Smoak or Damp, which causes a swelling in the Faces of those that are not us'd to it.</P>
<P>The curiosity and excellency of this shining Gum, <HI>Europe</HI> hath long since been acquainted with by those Chests and Coffers brought thither out of <HI>Iapan</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> for they both colour all their Wood-work over with it, and also their Ships, Houses, Tables, Bedsteds, and other Houshold-stuff.</P>
<P>The Revenue which this Province pays yearly to the Emperor amounts to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">es paid by this Province to the Emperor.</NOTE> what may seem an incredible sum of Money, <HI>viz.</HI> two hundred fifty one thou|sand two hundred ninety nine Bags of Rice; three hundred and seventy thou|sand four hundred sixty six Pound of raw Silk; two thousand five hundred seventy four Roles of Silk Stuffs; seventy eight hundred thousand four hun|dred

ninety one Bundles of Straw; besides the ordinary Customs paid to the two Custom-Houses, standing in the Metropolis <HI>Hangcheu:</HI> First, for the Mer|chandize in the North part of the City. Secondly, for the Wood in the South part; for the <HI>Chineses</HI> use much Wood for the building of their Houses, Ships, Coffins, and the like; and the Wood-Merchants being vast rich People, pay no small part of their gain to the Emperor. Moreover, this Province sends yearly four Imperial Ships, call'd <HI>Lung-ychuen</HI> to the Emperors Court, laden with Silk Clothes or Stuffs, wrought after a peculiar manner.</P>
<P>These Silk Stuffs are interwove with Gold and Silver, and also with the Pictures of the Bird call'd <HI>Funguang,</HI> Dragons, and the like: None are per|mitted to wear these Stuffs, but only the Emperor, and those of Imperial Blood; unless his Majesty out of a peculiar favor, gives them leave; and these badges of Clothes distinguish them from meaner People, as much as our Badges of the Cross and Garter, or the like, be marks of Noble Orders.</P>
<P>There are those that reckon the yearly Revenue of this Province to amount to above fifteen Millions of Crowns, fifteen hundred thousand Duckets, or se|ven hundred and fifty thousand Pound <HI>Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>BUt to return again to our Ambassador, who proceeded on his Journey the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mountains <HI>Iakoling.</HI></NOTE> twenty ninth of <HI>February,</HI> travelling over the Mountains of <HI>Iakoling,</HI> which because of their steep ascent make carriage difficult and dangerous. On the tops and sides stood several <HI>Pagodes</HI> or Temples, built after a strange man|ner, and surrounded with Trees: But at last leaving them behind, they past through the Villages <HI>Sambathova, Sagebatauw, Longhia, Longzango, Poangtiou,</HI> and <HI>Hachova,</HI> where they were drawn upon a float of Canes, over a River, which divided <HI>Hachova</HI> into a Southern and Northern part, in which last the <HI>Hollanders</HI> took their repose that Night, having that day gained a League and a half to the North.</P>
<P>The twenty fourth in the Morning, leaving <HI>Hachova,</HI> they travell'd the fol|lowing part of the day through <HI>Kolontja, Quanimg,</HI> and <HI>Souzinhova,</HI> and in the af|ternoon came to <HI>Pinhoea,</HI> where <HI>Putmans, Vander Does,</HI> and the rest that travel'd be|fore, met the Ambassador, and told him of their safe arrival there the day pre|ceding, and also that the Goods design'd for Presents were already Shipt in twenty seven Vessels, and that others lay ready to take in him, and the rest of the Goods: Whereupon, <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> was no sooner come into the Village before|mention'd, but he gave order for all his Necessaries to be Shipt off immedi|ately, and likewise caus'd the Oxen to be Imbarqu'd, that they might go for|ward on their Journey the next Morning. The Horses were forc'd to go five Leagues further by Land, because there wanted convenient Vessels to carry them.</P>
<P>The twenty sixth about Noon, after all things were ready, they set Sail from <HI>Puchoeu,</HI> going North-East up the River <HI>Chang,</HI> with a Fleet of about forty Vessels, amongst which were ten that carry'd the <HI>Mandarins</HI> Guides.</P>
<P>About three a Clock, they came to the City <HI>Tjanchia,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Chang|xa;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">anchia, Sunthia&punc;</NOTE> and having <HI>Sunthia,</HI> a pretty Village on their Larboard, cast Anchor that Night about three quarters of a League from <HI>Tjanchia,</HI> before a Sandy Plain, ha|ving gain'd two Leagues that afternoon.</P>
<P>The twenty seventh in the Morning, they Weigh'd, and pass'd between two Towers adorn'd with seven Galleries, one over another, built after the <HI>Chinese</HI>

manner, for a safeguard of that place; and likewise by the Villages <HI>Poetza, Sangsa, Singhia, Mocthauw, Ponvasa, Vanksivoe,</HI> and <HI>Vansoe;</HI> the first four on their Starboard, and the last on their Larboard: And in the afternoon Sail|ing by eight Villages more, standing on both sides of the River, (of which the Pilots knew not the Names) they arriv'd at <HI>Sinkkia</HI> in the Evening, where they staid all Night, having gone that day with the Currents on several Courses above five Leagues.</P>
<P>The twenty eighth in the Morning about Day-break, they set Sail again, and at nine a Clock Landed at the City <HI>Kitsjouw,</HI> or <HI>Kutchieuw,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Kiucheu;</HI> here they chang'd their Vessels.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>March,</HI> all the Goods were Ship'd again into other Vessels. At<NOTE PLACE="marg">March.</NOTE> Noon, two private Persons of the City presented the Ambassador with some fresh Provisions; in return for which, they receiv'd six Ells of <HI>Gingerline</HI> co|lour'd Cloth, which <HI>Putmans</HI> carry'd them; for which, they again in the Even|ing sent twelve Tail of ready Money, and three Silver Cups; but the Ambas|sadors modestly refus'd the Presents, and thanking, sent them back.</P>
<P><HI>Kiucheu,</HI> the sixth City of the Province <HI>Chekiang,</HI> lying on the Eastern-Shore<NOTE PLACE="marg">City <HI>Kiucheu.</HI></NOTE> of the River <HI>Chang,</HI> three days Journey by Land from the Territory <HI>Tiokien,</HI> over steep and difficult Mountains, seems pretty large, yet but meanly Inha|bited, and of small Concourse, and so having little or no Trade, yet the Streets are handsomely Pav'd, and all Provisions very cheap.</P>
<P>The second in the Morning, they left <HI>Kiucheu,</HI> and about nine a Clock pass'd by <HI>Sigajum,</HI> a Village lying on the right side, at the going up the River, in a pleasant place, surrounded with Arable Grounds: The remaining part of the day, they Sail'd by abundance of Villages standing along the River, a little way up into the Countrey, and in the Dusk of the Evening arriv'd at <HI>Loujujenne,</HI> where they staid that Night, having that Day gain'd five Leagues on several Courses.</P>
<P>From <HI>Loujujenne,</HI> having gotten two <HI>Coelies</HI> to Tow every Barque, they Weigh'd again the third in the Morning; and coming a little way from the Village, they saw a stately Tower built after the <HI>Chinese</HI> manner, with jutting Stories.</P>
<P>The Countrey every where well Manur'd, was also full of populous Villa|ges. In the afternoon they came to <HI>Lanqui,</HI> where their Goods and Persons were again to be put aboard other Barques. Soon after their arrival at this place, the Governor came to welcome the Ambassador, and present him with some fresh Provisions. This being the first Town where the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had receiv'd so much civility from the Governors; their Journey that day was three Leagues.</P>
<P>The Shipping of the Goods into other Vessels was referr'd till the fourth, because of the Rainy Weather. In the afternoon, the Lord Ambassador enter|tain'd the Governor, who in the mean while sent him in a Calf and a fat Wea|ther, and other Provisions, besides four Vessels of their Beer. This <HI>Mandarin</HI> shew'd himself very courteous to the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> for which kindnesses he was presented with five Ells of fine Cloth.</P>
<P>The fifth in the Morning, the adjacent Hills were all cover'd with Snow; but the Weather growing fair, their Goods were put aboard, and all things made ready to go away the next day.</P>
<P>The sixth, they left <HI>Lancqui</HI> before day.</P>
<P>This place, though not large, yet makes a handsome shew, being well built, and very populous, occasion'd by the many Trading Vessels that come thi|ther.
<PB N="278" REF="169">
It is pleasantly seated all along the River side: Hither abundance of Al|lom is brought from <HI>Humsie.</HI></P>
<P>In the forenoon, they pass'd by the City <HI>Sansjenne,</HI> a League and a half from<NOTE PLACE="marg">City <HI>Iansjenne.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Lacqui:</HI> On the left side as they went up the River, the Shore near the Water rises very high, and not inhabited, but in the Valleys stand some few Houses and Villages.</P>
<P>In the Evening they came to <HI>Ponkousong,</HI> where they staid all Night, leaving the City <HI>Niencheufu</HI> on their left Hand a quarter of a League, having that day gain'd five Leagues.</P>
<P>The next Morning, two hours before day, the <HI>Mandarin</HI> Guides caus'd the Drum to be beaten, that all might be ready to be gone immediately, which they did; but the Vessel in which the Ambassador was, struck upon a Sand, so that the rest which were behind, were ready to fall foul upon his Ship, such was the force of the Current; but day-light coming on, they got off again, and pass'd by divers Villages, Temples, and Hamlets, and also by a <HI>Pagode,</HI> in which stands the Image of a Philosopher, call'd <HI>Nienchlin.</HI></P>
<P>With the Dusk of the Evening, they arriv'd at <HI>Tungh,</HI> where they staid that Night, having gotten seven Leagues that day, by Steering several Courses.</P>
<P>The eighth in the Morning they set Sail again, and in the forenoon saw on their left Hand the River <HI>Tu,</HI> which glides towards the City <HI>Cinsung,</HI> or <HI>Sinc|hung,</HI> which having pass'd it, divides into two Branches, and at last discharges his Water into the Grand <HI>Che.</HI></P>
<P>This City being the seventh, in order to the Metropolis <HI>Hancheu,</HI> lies on the<NOTE PLACE="marg">City <HI>Sinching.</HI></NOTE> North side of the <HI>Tu,</HI> pretty close built, and surrounded with Plow'd Lands.</P>
<P>In the Evening they arriv'd at the City <HI>Fojang,</HI> or <HI>Fujang,</HI> scituate on the West<NOTE PLACE="marg">City <HI>Fujang.</HI></NOTE> side of the River <HI>Che,</HI> and Northward from the Stream <HI>Fuchun,</HI> which takes its Original a little Westward from the City <HI>Liengan,</HI> and joyneth its Waters South|ward from <HI>Fujang,</HI> with those of the <HI>Che.</HI> The Ambassador having gotten five Leagues forwarder on his Journey that day, lodg'd in <HI>Fujang</HI> that right.</P>
<P>The ninth in the Morning, they left <HI>Fujang</HI> before day.</P>
<P>Here the River <HI>Che</HI> is about two <HI>English</HI> Miles broad, yet hath but few Villa|ges on its Banks, most of them standing more up into the Countrey, by rea|son of his overflowing in great Rains; every where Manur'd and Planted with Fruit-Trees.</P>
<P>In the Evening they arriv'd at the South Suburb of <HI>Hangcheu,</HI> or <HI>Hancsieuw,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Chankeeuw,</HI> the Suburb of <HI>Hancheu.</HI></NOTE> call'd <HI>Chankeeuw,</HI> half a Leagues distance from <HI>Hangcheu;</HI> here all the Goods were forc'd to be Landed, then carry'd to the North Suburb of <HI>Hangcheu,</HI> where they were again Shipt, so that they staid there the following Night.</P>
<P>The next Morning, being the tenth, <HI>Huilavja,</HI> one of the <HI>Mandarin</HI> Guides, went to acquaint the Governor of the City with the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> coming, and to desire Barques for their further Voyage: He returning again in the Evening, told the Ambassador, That the foremention'd Governor intended to invite his Excellency the next day to Dinner, and that the <HI>Pinghtouw,</HI> or third Person in Office would do the like the day after, and give speedy Order for the prepa|ring of the Barques.</P>
<P>The same day, the <HI>Mandarin</HI> Guides, for the trouble they had already had, and to oblige them the more, were by the Ambassador, each of them, presen|ted with five Ells of Cloth.</P>
<P>The next Morning, being the eleventh, the Ambassador and his Council<NOTE PLACE="marg">Consult what to present the Governor withal.</NOTE> considering, that the Governor would that day invite them to Dinner; and

also if they should obtain the free Trade, what good this person might do them, judg'd it convenient, if he did invite them to take and present him with the following Gifts.</P>
<P>Ten Ells of Red Cloth, two Pieces of Perpetuanaes, four Pieces of Linnen, a Fowling-Piece, a pair of Pistols, two Sword Blades, two Perspective Glasses, and a String of Blood Coral.</P>
<P>But the Invitation came not that day, because <HI>Huilavja</HI> said a grand <HI>Tartar</HI> was come from <HI>Peking,</HI> with whom the Governor was in private consulting about State Affairs.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Mandarins</HI> coming to visit and welcome the Ambassadors, were kindly entertain'd by him. The same day, above six hundred Horse were Ferry'd over the River <HI>Che.</HI></P>
<P>The twelfth in the Morning, the <HI>Pinghtouw,</HI> or third Person of State in <HI>Han|cheu,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pingtouw</HI> visits the Am|bassador.</NOTE> which had the Command over all the Vessels, came aboard the Ambassa|dor to bid him Welcome, and also present him with a fat Weather, a Porker, some Poultery, Rice, and other fresh Provisions; desiring to be excus'd for his delay in not coming to visit the Ambassador sooner, being hinder'd by some grand <HI>Mandarins,</HI> that were lately gone up from thence to <HI>Peking,</HI> who had taken all the greatest Vessels with them, yet he should be careful, that the Ambassador should be well Accommodated, and that he would willingly invite his Excel|lency to Dinner, but durst not, before he had been at the Governors, but then he would be bold to desire him to come and be his Guest; for which kind proffers, he was civilly Entertain'd; and having seen the Horses and Oxen, he took his leave.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, the Interpreter <HI>Genko</HI> came to tell the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> that the Governor of <HI>Hancheu</HI> had enquir'd of him how the Ambassador was plac'd at his Entertainment by the General in <HI>Hoksieu.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning, being the thirteenth, several Horses came to the Am|bassadors<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ambassador goes to the General.</NOTE> Vessel, to fetch Him and his Retinue to the Governor's Court, whi|ther he went in a stately Equipage; taking those Presents with them, which they resolv'd to give him two days before. Coming to his Palace, they were after a little stay brought to his Presence, and the Ambassador Welcom'd by the Governor; who said, this Embassy would be very pleasing to the Empe|ror. Then he ask'd where the Pepper and <HI>Sandal-Wood</HI> grew? How big <HI>Hol|land</HI> was? How far distant from <HI>China?</HI> If there was any Silk in <HI>Holland?</HI> and many more such Questions, to which his Excellency answer'd him according|ly. Then the Tables being spread, they were desir'd to sit, and plentifully entertain'd.</P>
<P>Thus having spent some time, the Ambassador deliver'd him a Note of the foremention'd Presents, and with a Complement, desir'd him to accept them; which having read over, he excus'd himself, that he could not accept the Pre|sents, because he had never done the <HI>Hollanders</HI> any such Service, as the Vice-Roy and General in <HI>Hoksieu</HI> had done. Moreover, That they would have enough to do, in giving Presents at <HI>Peking,</HI> for there, every one gap'd for some|thing; and thereupon gave the Note again to the Interpreter <HI>Genko,</HI> which was again taken from him by one of the Governor's Secretaries which stood by him, and kept it. Whereupon the Ambassador desir'd, that the Governor would only please to accept of the Presents, as a sign of his good Inclination<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Governor refuses the Presents.</NOTE> towards him; and that hereafter, an opportunity might present, wherein he might assist the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> Moreover, the Ambassador Commanded the In|terpreter
<PB N="280" REF="172">
<HI>Gemko</HI> to tell the Governor, and desire him in his behalf, That when any of the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ships should accidentally by Storms or Tempestuous Weather, be forc'd to put into this River, or to <HI>Ningpo,</HI> that he would please to look upon them as Friends, and be assisting to them. The Interpreter seeming not to understand it well, was again Commanded by the Ambassador to Interpret it right, or else he would get another that should do it: Where|upon, telling it to his Highness, he made answer, That this was also the Em|peror's Haven and Countrey, and his Imperial Majesty's Order should be ob|serv'd in it: Moreover, he could not accept of the Presents, but he would con|sider till the happy return from <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>A little after, the Ambassador giving him many thanks for his kind Enter|tainment, took his leave; and upon the Governor's advice, he went to visit the <HI>Conbon</HI> of the City, who courteously receiv'd him with many Comple|ments, and a Cup of Bean Broth.</P>
<P>No Questions of remark did he propose to the Ambassador, only he related, That in their eighth Moneth, (which is our <HI>October</HI>) the last Year a Ship was at <HI>Priests Island,</HI> he desir'd to know whether it was a <HI>Dutch&punc;</HI> Man or not? To which the Ambassador reply'd, That he knew nothing of it, but that perhaps it might be a <HI>Hollander</HI> Sailing to <HI>Iapan:</HI> Whereupon taking his leave, the <HI>Con|bon</HI> advis'd him to go and Complement the <HI>Tartar Manchu,</HI> who had the chief Command over all the <HI>Militia</HI> in <HI>Hancheu;</HI> whither he accordingly went, but could not get admittance, being excus'd by his indisposition, so that in the Evening he return'd again to his Vessels.</P>
<P>The twenty fourth in the Morning, the Ambassador writ Complementing Letters to the Governor, <HI>Conbon,</HI> and <HI>Manchu,</HI> and presented the two last with some Gifts, thereby to win their Favor and good Opinion; the Letter to the Chief Governor was to this effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe Ambassador is much oblig'd to the Governor, for his generous Incli|nation<NOTE PLACE="marg">Complementing Letter to the General.</NOTE> and Nobleness to him, and hopes to express his Thanks, more by Deeds than Words; to which he doubts not, but the Heavens will grant him a fit Opportunity. He desires his Highness to accelerate his Journey to <HI>Peking,</HI> with the <HI>Chinkon,</HI> that he may the sooner return and find him in good Health.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The <HI>Conbon</HI>'s Letter was to this purpose:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THat the Ambassador did not expect so soon to have had an occasion to<NOTE PLACE="marg">To the <HI>Conbon.</HI></NOTE> present his Service to him, and desires he would be pleas'd to accept of these Presents, as a sign of his good Inclination, and for such his Favor, he shall exceedingly rejoyce.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>That to the <HI>Manchu</HI> was of the same effect.</P>
<P>With these Letters was sent an Inventory of the Presents; those to the <HI>Con|bon</HI> consisted in five Ells of Cloth, one piece of Perpetuanaes, two pieces of Linnen, one string of Amber, one piece of Amber, and two <HI>Rhinocerots</HI> Horns.</P>
<P>Those to the <HI>Manchu,</HI> two Knives with Gilded Hafts, one Fire-Lock, one Car|bine, one string of Amber, one Quilt, and five Ells of Cloth.</P>
<P>These Letters and Inventories, <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Vander Does</HI> were order'd to go to the several places, and deliver; but because of the Rainy Weather, it was referr'd.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="172">Mean while, a <HI>Mandarin</HI> came with one of the <HI>Conbon</HI>'s Factors, to present the Ambassador in his Master's Name with two Hogs, two Sheep, four Geese,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Presents sent from the <HI>Conbon</HI> to he Ambassador.</NOTE> eight Hens, two Pots of Liquor, Rice, and some other Provisions, which the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> receiv'd with many Thanks, and judg'd it convenient, to deliver the Notes of the Presents to them, to give to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eir Masters: But the Factor and the <HI>Mandarin</HI> being scrupulous to take it without some of the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> went with them; it was judg'd convenient since it still Rain'd very hard, and it being above an hours walk, to keep it till dry Weather, that then it might be carry'd with the rest, as before mention'd.</P>
<P>In the Evening, <HI>Hiulavja</HI> came to tell the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> that he had been with the Barques lying on the other side of the City, which were all ready, so that the Goods might be sent aboard the next Morning: If there should not be <HI>Coe|lis</HI> or Porters enough to carry them all in one day, they should send away as many as they could, and leave the rest till the day after: Whereupon, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> gave immediate Order, for the getting of all things ready against the next Morning, yet they were hinder'd by the great Rain, the Ways being made (in a manner) unpassable thereby.</P>
<P>Mean while, the Ambassador considering the Prime Governors answer to his Motion about Ships having liberty to put in there in Stormy Weather, Pro|pos'd to the Council, If it would not be for their advantage, to make a trial of it, and Order one of the Frigats, which from <HI>Batavia</HI> were expected at <HI>Hoksieu</HI> to come to <HI>Ningpo,</HI> with a Lading of such Goods, as they should think conve|nient, to be Barter'd for Silk; and this trial in his judgment could never be made in a better time, than whilst they were there present: Whereupon it was concluded, that <HI>Nobel</HI> and the Secretary, when they carry'd the Letters to the Governor and <HI>Conbon,</HI> they should again speak to them concerning the coming thither of a Ship, and then they might govern themselves ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>The sixteenth in the Morning, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were by the Chief Governor's<NOTE PLACE="marg">General's Present.</NOTE> Order presented with two fat Weathers, two Porkers, some Poultery, and other Provisions; which they receiv'd, and gave the Bearers some Money for a Gratuity. So soon as the Weather began to grow fair, as many Goods were unladen, as there were <HI>Coelis</HI> to carry them, with which <HI>Putman</HI>'s went to the other side of the City to give Order for their reimbarquing.</P>
<P>Mean while, <HI>Nobel</HI> and the Secretary <HI>Vander Does</HI> went to the Governor of<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Vander Does</HI> go to the General.</NOTE> the City, to deliver the foremention'd Letters. They took the Horses also with them, because one of the Guides had told the Ambassador, that his Highness was desirous to see them; whither being come, after a short stay, and the Go|vernor having view'd the Horses with great delight, <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Vander Does</HI> de|liver'd his Highness the Letter, and return'd him humble Thanks for the Pre|sents which he had sent the Ambassador the day before.</P>
<P>Then they also ask'd, (it suiting with their present Discourse) If it should happen that a <HI>Hollands</HI> Ship should come thither, if it would be Welcome to his Highness, and the People us'd as courteously as they were? To which the General answer'd, That such strangers as they, which come from remote Countreys, to seek Friendship, and Present the Emperor, ought to have kind|ness shown them; therefore what reason should he have to deal discourteously with the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> when ever they come thither? They might rest satisfi'd, for he assur'd them, that if they came into his Jurisdiction, he would take care for them, and shew them all the kindness he could.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="173">After which answer, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> taking their leave went to the <HI>Conbon,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Goes also to the <HI>Conbon.</HI></NOTE> to whom they also deliver'd the Ambassador's Letter and Note of the Presents, telling him, that no Blood Coral was mention'd in the Note, because they had none at the present, but they hop'd, that a Ship would shortly come thither, and that then, they would furnish his Highness with what quantity he pleas'd; using this Discourse purposely, because they would have the better opportuni|ty to speak of the Ship. Then they desir'd, that if a <HI>Holland</HI> Vessel should chance to come thither, whether he would be courteous to the <HI>Netherlanders?</HI> To which he answer'd as the General had done, adding, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> must Command their People to use no Hostility where ever they came with their Ships.</P>

<P>The nineteenth in the Morning, the Ambassador leaving <HI>Hanchu,</HI> came in the Evening to <HI>Tangseeuw,</HI> a handsom Village, where they staid all that Night, having that day Sail'd three Leagues.</P>

Which is also perhaps the reason, that the Silk which is made in <HI>Europe,</HI> is generally much thicker and courser than that in <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>Between the Prizes of the first and second Spinning, the <HI>Chineses</HI> make a great difference, notwithstanding the greatest Silk-Throsters in <HI>Europe</HI> have no knowledge to distinguish the one from the other: The best Silk they Spin in <HI>Lent,</HI> and the coursest and biggest in <HI>Iune,</HI> so that both sorts are made in one Year. The breeding of these Worms is all one trouble, and requires as much care as they do in any places of <HI>Europe.</HI> Wherefore it is a meer Fable, that all the Silk in <HI>China</HI> is made by the Silk Worms upon the Trees, without the labor or industry of Man.</P>
<P><HI>Martinius</HI> tell us, That the breeding of Silk Worms, and the manner of ma|king<NOTE PLACE="marg">Histor.

But however, the <HI>Chineses</HI> may justly claim the honor, that from them, as the chief Fountain, the Art of making Silk was carry'd to other remote Countreys in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

<P>This <HI>Kiangning</HI> lieth in thirty two Degrees and fifteen Minutes Northern Latitude, about six Leagues from the Eastern Shore of the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> in a pleasant and delightful Plain; for the River <HI>Kiang</HI> flows through broad and deep digg'd Graffs, not onely by the City Walls, but also into it with several Navigable Channels.</P>
<P>In like manner the East side of the City, lying in a pleasant Valley, is inter|woven with broad Graffs, by which means they may as well come to this part of the City in Barges, as to that side which verges with the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> and may there likewise lade and unlade Vessels of ordinary Burthen.</P>
<P>Over all these Graffs lead several Stone Bridges, supported on divers Arches.</P>
<P>Over the fore-mention'd Channel, which runs from the River <HI>Kiang</HI> into the City, is a Bridge with fourteen Arches.</P>
<P>According to the opinion of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Geographers, this City doth not onely exceed all other Cities on the Earth in bigness, but also in beauty; and indeed she is inferior to few: for as to what concerns her inward part is most plain, except some pleasant and easie Ascents. It stands surrounded with a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Walls.</NOTE> double Wall; the first and innermost of which is six <HI>German</HI> Miles in circumfe|rence, or according to <HI>Trigaut</HI> and <HI>Martinius,</HI> eighteen <HI>Italian</HI> Miles; yet the City it self is not above six Leagues in circumference.</P>
<P>This Wall incloseth the Palace, and most part of the City.</P>
<P>The second, or outward Wall is much bigger, but not continu'd round, or joyn'd together in all places, but stands onely as a Defence in those places where the City is weakest. When two Troopers (for so the <HI>Chineses</HI> describe this Wall) are sent from one another in the Morning to Ride about the City, they meet not again till Night; by which may easily be judg'd the bigness of the Wall and City. Notwithstanding within the circumference of this Wall there are great and spacious Gardens, Lakes, Mounts and Warrens, yet the greatest part thereof is full of Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The first Wall, which is above thirty Foot high, whose under part consists of Free-Stone, but the upper onely of bak'd Stones, or Bricks, is rais'd very even, and hath Battlements, round about strengthned with Redoubts and Watch-houses. It reckons thirteen Gates, some of which have four, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gates.</NOTE> others five Posterns, whose Doors are cover'd with Iron Plates. Every one of these Gates are continually Guarded by strong Parties of Soldiers. The chiefest Streets are about twenty eight Paces broad, and being as direct as a Line, are in the middle Pav'd with broad blue Stones, and on each side with Pebbles. The common Citizens Houses are neither fair nor costly, but mean and with|out Conveniences, being but one Story high, standing all with their Gable|ends towards the Streets, with onely one Door. The Front hath a square Hole in stead of a Window, before which they have a woodden Shutter, which they let down, and those that drive any Trade lay their Commodities upon them to sell, and to prevent People from looking in, they generally hang a Rush Mat before it in stead of a Glass Window. The whole House on the out-side
<PB N="286" REF="178">
is from top to bottom Plaister'd with very white Mortar or Lime, and the sloaping Roof cover'd with white Tyles. In most of the Houses are Shops, fill'd with all manner of <HI>Chinese</HI> Commodities, as Cotton, Silk-Stuffs, <HI>Porcel|lane,</HI> Pearls, Diamonds, and other rich Merchandises: others also have Pedling Wares. Before every Shop stands a Plank or Board, and before some two, on which the Master of the House his Name is written in Letters of Gold, and what Commodities he hath to sell: Next these Boards stands also a Post, or rather a Pole, which is higher than the House, on which they put a Penon, or Flag, whereby they may distinguish every ones Habitation, as here in <HI>Europe</HI> they do by Signs.</P>
<P>Here are also many fair Edifices, as Temples, stately Triumphal Arches, Palaces, and other publick Buildings.</P>
<P>There was formerly a very magnificent Palace, built square, being the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An antient Palac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of the Emperors.</NOTE> Court and Residence of the ancient <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperors, but now lies ruin'd on the South part of the City; one side of it may still be measur'd, and bears an <HI>Italian</HI> Mile and two hundred Paces in length, and is inclos'd within the inner Wall, which encompasseth the greatest part of the City. It was formerly sur|rounded with three Walls, and deep Moats. According to the remaining part of this Wall, the fore-mention'd <HI>Trigaut</HI> reckons the circumference to be four or five <HI>Italian</HI> Miles. In the middle there yet appears a broad Way Pav'd with Free-Stone, which runs through the whole Work like a Cross. On each side of it may be seen curious Carv'd Stones, which stand four Foot high, and behind them a little Rivulet of clear Water. The Tyles on the Roof were of hard Stone, wrought with Dragons, and the Emperor's Arms Painted in a Gold colour, so that when the Sun shin'd upon them they glitter'd like Gold.</P>
<P>In the last <HI>Tartar</HI> Wars this stately Edifice and Court was burnt and pull'd down to the Ground, so turning that which before was the wonder of the World into a heap of Rubbish; yet no other way bereaving the City of her ancient lustre: which was done out of a peculiar hatred that the <HI>Tartar</HI> bore to the <HI>Taimingian</HI> Family, because <HI>Hamvu,</HI> or <HI>Che,</HI> the first promoter of that Family, drove the <HI>Tartars</HI> out of the Empire, after they had possess'd it a hundred and eight years, and planted the Branches of their own Stock in the Throne in this fore-mention'd Palace, till such time as it was remov'd from thence to <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>The City is very populous, and said to be inhabited by ten hundred thou|sand, or a Million of Souls, besides a Garison of forty thousand <HI>Tartars:</HI> for the Governor of the Southern Provinces Resides here in the Emperor's Name.</P>
<P>But above all we ought not to forget a Tower, built on a high Hill, which<NOTE PLACE="marg">A strange Tower.</NOTE> may justly be call'd <HI>A Tower of Art,</HI> because three artificial Pieces of Work are kept in it, the like of which are not in the whole World: The first a Celestial Globe, distinguish'd by its Equinoctial, and other equidistant Lines; the se|cond is an <HI>Armilla aquatoria,</HI> consisting in a Perspective Glass, with two Circles, each movable upon their Point; the third is a <HI>Sphaera armillarii,</HI> very like our <HI>European;</HI> every one of them hath twelve Feet upon the Aequator, or middle Line, made of Copper, Gilt and curiously wrought: They stand upon Dra|gons cut of Copper, and are so exact and artificially made, that the most ex|perienc'd Astronomer cannot discern the least fault in them: and notwith|standing the <HI>Tartars</HI> of the Family <HI>Iuen</HI> plac'd them there three hundred and seventy years since, yet they retain their ancient lustre, as if but newly made.</P>
<P>On the out-part of the City stands a famous <HI>Pagode,</HI> or Temple, by some<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Pagode Paolinxi.</HI></NOTE>

call'd <HI>Paolinxi,</HI> and by others <HI>Paulinying;</HI> for we may observe, that by the Name of <HI>Paolinxi</HI> the <HI>Chineses</HI> do not onely express the Temple it self, but also a great Plain at the Foot of a Mountain, adorn'd with many fair Buildings, <HI>Pagodes, Porcelane</HI> Towers, and other fair and stately Edifices; amongst all which one, being a Temple, exceeds all the rest: it is adorn'd with ten thousand Images, made of Mortar; and curiously Painted; the largest are as big as the Life, and the smallest not exceeding a Hand; both which stand in several Entries, or Gal|leries round about the Wall, four or five Rows one above another, the greatest on the top, and the smallest at the bottom.</P>
<P>In the middle of the Plain, to which they ascend by twelve Steps, stands<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Porcellane</HI> Tower</NOTE> a high Tower of <HI>Porcelane,</HI> which for costliness and all manner of rare work|manship, hath not its paralell in all <HI>China.</HI> It consists in nine (though ac|cording to <HI>Semedo</HI> scarce in six) Vaulted Stories, to be ascended on the in-side by a hundred and four Steps. Round about every Story is a Gallery, curiously adorn'd with Images and Windows; on both sides of which are square Holes for the Light to come in at, with Ivory Bars; all the Work on the out-side Polish'd or Glaz'd with divers Colours, as Red, Green, and Yellow: The whole Structure made of several Pieces so curiously Cemented together, that it seems to be one intire thing. Between the Galleries are Juttings out, made like Pent-houses, and colour'd with Green; at each corner whereof hang small Copper Bells, which mov'd by the Wind make a continual and pleasant tink|ling. The upper part of the Tower, to which none can get, unless they climb up the out-side, is Crown'd, as the <HI>Chineses</HI> say, with a great Pine-Apple of Massy Gold: from which upper Gallery they may see, not onely over the whole City of <HI>Nanking,</HI> but all the adjacent Plains, as far as the Eye can reach. They say, that when the <HI>Tartars, Anno</HI> 1200. first conquer'd the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> they forc'd them to build this Structure in commemoration of their Victory: for which reason, as it appears, the <HI>Tartars,</HI> when in our Age they conquer'd the Empire a second time, they never offer'd to deface it, but let it stand in its full glory, when as they pull'd down all other antient Monuments, Buildings, and <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperors Tombs to the Ground.</P>
<P>Without the Walls of the City are the Tombs of the antique Kings; near which stands a Grove of lofty Pines, surrounded with a Wall of three <HI>German</HI> Miles in circumference.</P>
<P>Within this Inclosure also appears a Hill, whereon likewise are erected seve|ral Tombs; and not far distant a most magnificent Temple, a Royal Building, as well for its Prospect as State: It consists for the most part of Wood, except the Walls, which are of Brick, and stands on a Summit inviron'd with Free-Stone: you go into it by four pair of Stairs, opening to the sour Winds: It hath five Galleries, about which stand two Rows of wooden Pillars, each thirty six Foot high, and above two Fathom thick: On these rest great Pieces of cross Timber, and on them stand other lesser Pillars, whereon lies the Roof, of Carv'd and Gilt Boards: The Doors are Figur'd with Laurel Leaves, and cover'd with Gilded Plates. The Imagery of the outer Galleries and Win|dows are incircled with Gilded Wyres to keep the Birds from either making their Nests, or defiling them; yet the Wyres are so thin and wide, that they may easily see through: which is also observ'd in all great Buildings, espe|cially the Emperor's Palaces. In the middle of the Temple stand two Thrones, wrought with great Art, and beset with Pearls, and all manner of Precious Gems; on them stand two Chairs, in one of which the Emperor sits
<PB N="288" REF="181">
when he makes Offerings; to do which none else is permitted; and the other stands empty for their Deity, who they say, sits therein, and receives the Of|fering. Without the Temple stand many Altars of Red Marble&punc; which repre|sent the Moon, Sun, Hills and Floods: and according to the <HI>Chineses</HI> Relati|ons, all these Altars are plac'd without the Temple, that none might worship them, but that every one should know they are of the same Structure which the Emperor worships in the Temple. Round about are several Chambers, or rather Cells, which formerly, as they say, were us'd as <HI>Bannia's,</HI> in which the Emperor, when he went to Offer, Bath'd himself with his Attendants.</P>
<P>To this Temple, and to the Emperor's Tombs, lead very broad Ways, on each side planted with five Rows of Pine-trees, at equal distance, and in a direct Line; from which none might break a Bough on pain of death.</P>
<P>All these Buildings were ruin'd in the late <HI>Tartar</HI> Wars, the Trees pluck'd up, the Tombs defac'd, and the Temples and Palaces utterly laid waste.</P>

<P>This Countrey, as the former, lies most in Water, the East part of it being wash'd by the Sea, and the rest surrounded by Rivers, which with their Bran|ches cutting through the middle, and all Places else of it make the whole Na|vigable: It contains onely three Towns, which in bigness, populosity, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Towns.</NOTE> variety of Commodities may stand in competition with many more eminent Cities; the first and chiefest is <HI>Sunkiang,</HI> the other two <HI>Langhai</HI> and <HI>Cingpai.</HI></P>

Between these lie se|veral Bridges, over which they pass out of one into another: beyond the Bridges the Channel extends it self to a greater breadth, and receives Water from several Places; which makes so great a Navigation by that City, that it cannot be express'd; for all the Ships or Vessels that come from the Province of <HI>Chekiang</HI> and the other Eastern Towns, to go to <HI>Peking</HI> and other Places, must stop here, to put up their Masts, and hold out their Sails, not being able hitherto to use them, because of the many Bridges in that Channel; for from hence to the Grand Metropolis <HI>Peking</HI> no Bridge is suffer'd excepting one to draw up.</P>

<P>The next Morning, being the twenty sixth, the Horses (being till that time prevented by Stormy Weather) were Landed and put in Stables ashore.</P>
<P>The twenty seventh nothing hapned of note, onely some <HI>Mandarins</HI> came from the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> (who keeps in this City to the number of twen|ty five) to Complement and Welcom the Ambassador, whilst the <HI>Netherlan|ders</HI> waited for fresh Vessels to be gone again, of which they then saw no likelihood, notwithstanding the <HI>Mandarine</HI> Guides had told them the day before, that without fail they should have them as that day. They also saw little hopes of their going, there being no convenient Vessels to be had to carry their Horses.</P>
<P>The <HI>Conbon</HI> having the day before sent to ask the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> if they had no Pistols, nor Sword-blades to dispose of? it was judg'd fit on the twenty eighth, (observing what Courtesies the fore-mention'd Lord might do them in their coming thither) to present him with a pair of Pistols, two Sword-blades, five Ells of Scarlet, one String of Amber, two Pieces of Linnen, and a Quilt: But the <HI>Conbon</HI> would not accept any thing of the Presents, which were carry'd to him by the Secretary, onely the Pistols and Sword-blades; so that the rest he brought back again.</P>

<P>The whole City <HI>Siucheu</HI> hath its Situation on the Banks of a great standing River, which cuts through the City cross-ways, and is Navigable both for small and great Vessels. The Walls of the City, according to the <HI>Chinese</HI> Geo|graphers, are forty <HI>Chinese</HI> Furlongs in circumference, and with the Suburbs above a hundred: As the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were inform'd, the City covers a Spot of three Leagues in circumference. Without and within are many stately Bridges of Stone, resting on several Arches. It is but thinly built, and the Hou|ses are erected on Pine-tree Masts, many of them being very sleight.</P>
<P><HI>Siucheu,</HI> because of its nearness to the Sea and the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> is a Place of great Trade, and hath many Ships belonging to it; nay, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> saw so many Boats in all Places, that there was scarce room to get through them.</P>

<P>All things, not onely for the subsistence of Man, but also for pleasure, may be had here in great plenty. It is one of the famousest Places in all <HI>China,</HI> be|cause all the <HI>Portuguese, Indian, Iapan,</HI> and other Commodities that come from foreign Countreys, are brought thither not onely by Strangers, but the <HI>Chine|ses</HI> themselves. There also come many Merchants from <HI>Nanking</HI> and other Places to Trade, which makes, that from year to year there is a continual Trade here, and Ships going from hence to other Provinces and Cities: and because the Ships should not be in danger when they Sail cross the neighbor|ing Lake <HI>Tai,</HI> there is a Channel made on the North side of the Lake, which runs from the City <HI>Sucheu</HI> to that of <HI>Chinkiang;</HI> so that it discharges its Waters in the River <HI>Kiang;</HI> but yet the Course of it is stopp'd up there by a Sluce, which is drawn up, or let down when they please. But as they travel from <HI>Sucheu</HI> to <HI>Ukiang,</HI> or from <HI>Ukiang</HI> to <HI>Sucheu,</HI> is a Stone Bridge, resting on three hundred Arches, by which the Channel is divided from the Lake <HI>Tai.</HI> On this Bridge they draw their Vessels along by a Line, it being built for that purpose, that they need not lie still there with their Ships.</P>
<P>Without the Walls of the City stands a Custom-house, where they pay no Custom for Goods, but for the Ships according to their Burthen: and it is said that this Custom comes Annually to ten hundred thousand <HI>Ducats,</HI> or five hundred thousand Pound <HI>Sterling;</HI> whereby it may easily be judg'd how ma|ny Ships go constantly up and down this River; whereas all the Emperor's Vessels, or those that carry any thing to the Court, pay nothing.</P>
<P>Many of the Emperor's greatest Barques, call'd <HI>Lunchyven,</HI> past by whilst the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Rid at Anchor there.</P>
<P>The City is Govern'd by a <HI>Conbon</HI> or Governor, who at that time was a <HI>Leao|hing Chinese,</HI> and highly belov'd by all Persons.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were gone about a League from the City they pass'd by <HI>Xuciquan,</HI> a large Village, and in the Afternoon saw two hundred of the Emperor's great Barques lying at Anchor. In the Evening they arriv'd at the South-East side of the Suburb <HI>Usie,</HI> having that day with Sailing and Towing pass'd six Leagues in several Courses.</P>
<P><HI>Usie,</HI> the second substitute City to the fifth Metropolis <HI>Changcheu,</HI> signifies<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City&punc; <HI>Usie.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Wanting of Tin;</HI> for formerly on Mount <HI>Sie</HI> near <HI>Fusie,</HI> the <HI>Chineses</HI> found a great deal of that Metal; but in the beginning of the Reign of the Imperial Family of <HI>Han,</HI> most of the Mines were exhausted, for which reason the City receiv'd that Denomination.</P>
<P>Here the <HI>Hollanders</HI> found many Stone Ovens, in which they Bake, or har|den with Heat to that purpose, all manner of Stone.</P>
<P>In the Morning, being the first of <HI>April,</HI> they proceeded on their Journey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April.</NOTE> and Sailing about a Musquet-shot from the Walls of <HI>Usie,</HI> which leaving on their Lar-board, they arriv'd at the North-Suburb; where having stay'd some time for <HI>Coelies,</HI> or Men to Tow them, they went forward again. About Noon they Sail'd through <HI>Unquouw,</HI> a Village situate on both sides of the Channel, where they saw divers Vessels full of <HI>Indigo</HI> (which the Masters of them said was to be had at <HI>Sinchian</HI> and <HI>Sucheu,</HI>) and towards the Evening arriv'd at the Village <HI>Gongling,</HI> where they stay'd all that Night, having that day Sail'd three Leagues and a half in a Northerly Course.</P>
<P>The second in the Morning leaving the Village <HI>Gongling,</HI> and after half a
<PB N="296" REF="185">
Leagues Towing through the Village <HI>Syksiovyem</HI> they dropp'd Anchor in the Evening on the North side of the City <HI>Siucheuw,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Cbangcheu,</HI> that there they might furnish themselves with fresh <HI>Coelies;</HI> but none being to be had there so suddenly, they were forc'd to stay that Night, having not gain'd above two Leagues in a North-West Course all that day: The reason why they made no greater speed was, because the Channel was very full of the Emperor's Barques, which by reason of their Bulk and deep Lading made but little way, and the Channel so narrow, that they could not pass them.</P>
<P>The sides of this Channel near the City are rais'd with much braver Stone than the other parts.</P>
<P>The third in the Morning going on farther, and passing through the Vil|lage <HI>Laytschem,</HI> they arriv'd at <HI>Luesinga</HI> in the Evening; where dropping An|chor they stay'd all Night to get fresh <HI>Coelies</HI> to Tow their Vessels, with which they came that day but three Leagues, because of the slow progress of the Emperor's Barques.</P>
<P>The fourth leaving <HI>Luesinga,</HI> they came, after they had been Tow'd through the Village call'd <HI>Sucouw,</HI> to the City <HI>Tanyang:</HI> in the Afternoon Sailing along<NOTE PLACE="marg">City <HI>Tanyang.</HI></NOTE> the Walls thereof to the East Suburb, where they stay'd that Night to get new <HI>Coelies,</HI> having that day Sail'd and been Tow'd in a Northerly Course three Leagues.</P>
<P>The fifth in the Morning they set forth again with fresh <HI>Coelies,</HI> and leaving the City <HI>Tanyang,</HI> pass'd by a Lake, which by three Sluces empties her Waters into this Channel. In the Afternoon they came to a little Village call'd <HI>Hongunpek,</HI> where they spent some time in resting themselves, being much tir'd by slippery Ways, and the Wind being against the Vessels, whose high build|ing had the greater force of them. So soon as they had eaten they went away again, and in the Evening arriv'd at the Village <HI>Singfon,</HI> where they were for|ced by tempestuous Weather to drop Anchor, having that day by several Courses been Tow'd two Leagues and a half.</P>
<P>The sixth in the Morning leaving <HI>Singhfon,</HI> they saw several Stone Ovens: about Noon passing by the Walls of the City <HI>Sinkiang,</HI> or <HI>Chinkiang,</HI> they dropt<NOTE PLACE="marg">City <HI>Chinkiang.</HI></NOTE> Anchor at the North Suburb, to make preparation for their going up the <HI>Nan|king</HI> Stream, or River <HI>Kiang,</HI> and likewise (as their <HI>Mandarine</HI> Guides said) to exchange some Barques, having this day been Tow'd about two Leagues.</P>
<P>The seventh in the Morning several <HI>Tartar Mandarins</HI> came to Complement the Ambassador, and bid him welcom, whilst he entertain'd them with a Glass of Wine. One of them after his departure sent the the Ambassador a Porker, a Goat, and some Fruit, which he thankfully receiv'd, and in return sent him some counterfeit Pearls, which he would else have bought. The Ambassador<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ambassador is in|vited to the Governor.</NOTE> was also by a <HI>Mandarin</HI> invited to Dinner with the Governor of that Place; whither he went in the Afternoon (another <HI>Mandarin</HI> coming from the fore|mention'd Governor with Horses to fetch him) with <HI>Putmans</HI> the Secretary, and all his Retinue, except <HI>Nobel,</HI> who could not go because of his indisposition; and coming to the Governor they were courteously receiv'd and welcom'd.</P>
<P>This Lord gaz'd so exceedingly upon the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ambassador and his Retinue, that he forgot his Eating and Drinking; by which means also no Discourse hapned amongst them of any remark; so that the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> af|ter a civil Entertainment took their leave.</P>
<P>In the Evening the Interpreters, <HI>Ienko</HI> and <HI>Liulako,</HI> came to tell the Ambassa|dor, that they had a second time been sent for to the fore-mention'd Governor,
<PB N="297" REF="185">
who ask'd them for the number and quality of the Emperor's Presents, which as far as they knew they had given him an account of in Writing, whereat he was exceedingly amaz'd, saying, That without doubt they would be very acceptable. Moreover, he ask'd them if the Ambassador had no Blood-Coral, Pistols, Sword-blades, counterfeit Pearls, and the like? because he would willingly buy some of them, and therefore desir'd that they would please to speak to the Ambassador: Which being consider'd by the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> and observ'd that this was a <HI>Tartar,</HI> and a Man of great Quality, who in and about the City bore the Command over a great number of Soldiers, and that he might do much for their advantage at <HI>Peking,</HI> they judg'd it conveni|ent in the Morning to send and present him with five Ells and a half of Stam|mel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Presents to the Gover|nor.</NOTE> five of Sky-colour'd Cloth, a Perspective Glass, two Pieces of Linnen, one String of Amber Beads, and some counterfeit Pearls; and with them were sent a Complementing Letter to this effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe Ambassador is extreamly satisfi'd with, and oblig'd for <HI>Talavja</HI>'s or his Lordships Civilities, and desires him to accept of these small Gifts as a token of Friendship; and in so doing will farther oblige the <HI>Hollanders:</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>Captain <HI>Putmans</HI> was order'd to carry the Governor the fore-mention'd Presents and Letter that Morning, but saw him come early Riding towards the Barques; so that it was thought fit to stay till his Return. Mean while the Ambassador's Son went with the Pilot and Interpreter <HI>Maurice</HI> a Fowling on the Banks of the River <HI>Kiang.</HI> The Governor returning, in the Afternoon came with four of his chiefest Lords to see the Oxen and Horses, and also to visit the Ambassador, protesting he could not avoid waiting on him, being so much pleas'd with his Conversation: Whereupon the Ambassador call'd for his Musick; with the pleasure of which he seem'd even ravish'd: After which being entertain'd with <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine and Sweet-meats, he departed.</P>
<P>The Gifts design'd for the Governor were now ready to be presented; but he modestly refus'd them, saying, He could not accept of them as yet, giving him many thanks in the mean time. Then asking <HI>Genko</HI> and <HI>Liulako</HI> the In|terpreters, who were there present, if the Geueral of <HI>Hanksieu,</HI> and <HI>Conbon</HI> of <HI>Seucheu</HI> had receiv'd any Presents of the Ambassador? To which they an|swer'd, That the General of <HI>Hanksieu</HI> had not, but the <HI>Conbon</HI> of <HI>Sucheu</HI> was pleas'd to cull out a couple of Swords: Whereupon he a second time refus'd the Gifts; but adding, That if any Swords had been mention'd in the Note, he would have been glad of them. Wherefore the Ambassador after his departure chose a Sword from a peculiar Parcel, (for they had but few) and in stead of a Pistol, of which also they had no great store, (for all the enquiring was for those two sorts of Arms) added a Carbine to the Presents. Which done, <HI>Putmans</HI> went a second time to the Governor with them. The Swords, Carbine, Sky-colour'd Cloth, and counterfeit Pearl he receiv'd, but the rest he sent back; when several of the Generals Children coming to see the Ambassador in his Barque, were in respect to their Parents presented with Amber Necklaces and other Trifles.</P>
<P>After the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> had stay'd till towards the Evening waiting for Ves|sels to Ferry them over the River <HI>Kiang</HI> (for there were none but a great Boat, which the <HI>Mandarin</HI> Guide <HI>Hiulavja</HI> kept for himself, under pretence that that which he came in was grown leaky) they went with all their Vessels to the Mouth of the Haven before a <HI>Pagode,</HI> where they stay'd all that Night,
<PB N="298" REF="186">
whilst the Guide <HI>Mandarins</HI> offer'd a Goat and a Swine to their Deity, before which, as they say, they durst not Sail up the River.</P>
<P>The chiefest of them went into the <HI>Pagode</HI> or Temple, carrying the slain Sa|crifice to lay it on the Altar; when the Priest at their approach fell devoutly upon his Knees, and began to Mutter and Pray to himself. In the Temple, being Painted Red, hung several Lamps, which burnt Night and Day for the Deceas'd Souls: On one side of the Altar stood a Trough, wherein they laid the Victim; and on the other, a Rush Box with small pieces of Canes, which were the <HI>Sortes</HI> or Lots cast by the Priests, to know future Events.</P>
<P>Presently after Noon, the Governor of <HI>Sinkian</HI> came with a Train of great Lords to the same Temple; which he was no sooner enter'd, but he sent for the Ambassador, desiring him, he would Command his Musick with him, which the Ambassador did; and so repairing to the Temple, the Governor Entertain'd them with Bean-Broth, and the Ambassador on the other side, Cordiall'd them with Preserv'd Nutmegs, which the Governor and his <HI>Manda|rins</HI> having never tasted of before, Eat with great delight, while the Musicians plaid on their several Instruments.</P>
<P>After some stay, the Governor desir'd to see the Horses, which the Ambas|sador caus'd to be brought out of the Barques, which they all beheld with great admiration, saying, That they had never seen the like, therefore they doubted not, but they would be very acceptable to the Emperor; after they had seen the Horses, the Governor return'd again to the City, and the <HI>Hollan|ders</HI> to their Barques.</P>
<P>On Sunday, being the tenth, and <HI>Easterday,</HI> they set Sail with a South-East Wind from the City of <HI>Sinkiun;</HI> the Ambassador with twelve Barques more, went Northerly cross the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> and after having Tack'd too and again about an hour, they arriv'd at the North-side of the River, about a quarter of a League distant from the Garrison of <HI>Quasieu,</HI> or <HI>Quacheu,</HI> through a great Stone Sluce, in an artificial Channel, running Northerly by the seventh Metropolis <HI>Xangcheu,</HI> to the Lake <HI>Piexe.</HI> This Trench is digg'd directly through the Coun|trey, to make a way for Shipping out of the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> (which in that place sends no Branches to the North, but runs direct East towards the Sea) into the <HI>Yellow River.</HI></P>
<P>It was at first in the Embassy of <HI>Peter de Goyer,</HI> and <HI>Iacob de Keys,</HI> by <HI>Nieuhof</HI> call'd, <HI>The Royal Channel,</HI> partly for her breadth and pleasantness, and partly, be|cause it was built at the King's Charge.</P>
<P>They were Tow'd thorow the same in several Courses, having divers Reaches and Windings in half a League: At the end of which they arriv'd at a Village call'd <HI>Tongnanghong,</HI> where they rested a little, whilst the Ambassa|dor walk'd ashore to see the foremention'd Sluces; and going also towards a Temple, was met by two <HI>Mandarins,</HI> (one a <HI>Sinksieuwan,</HI> and according to his own saying, the second Person of <HI>Quasieu,</HI> and the other a <HI>Tartar,</HI> and Gover|nor of that Village) who both civilly welcom'd him, for which he return'd them Thanks. He of <HI>Sincksieuw</HI> being ask'd by the Ambassador concerning<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discourse between the Ambassador and two <HI>Man|darins.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Tayowan,</HI> whether it would be deliver'd, answer'd, That he was well satisfi'd, that this Embassy, and chiefly the Presents which the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> brought, would be very acceptable to the Emperor; and that he doubted not of their good success in their Business, and that all their Wishes were, that the <HI>Nether|landers</HI> were enter'd into a League with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> in the Countrey of <HI>China,</HI> and that they might come there to Trade with them, and then they should
<PB N="299" REF="186">
hope, that the Foraign Traffique would again be permitted as formerly; whereas, because of the strict Watches at the Sea-Port Towns, nothing could be done; and that the Countrey People could not put off their Commodities; and if you Fee the Courtiers well, nothing will be deny'd at <HI>Peking&punc;</HI></P>
<P>As to what concern'd <HI>Tayowan,</HI> it was in a mean condition, because they were obstructed from Trading to any place in <HI>China,</HI> and likewise all their best People were gone; therefore if the Emperor would only joyn twenty Jonks to the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ships, it might easily be taken.</P>
<P>That about five Moneths since, a Messenger had been there from the Em|peror, to bring all the <HI>Chineses</HI> there present under Subjection, who had also Order, that if those of <HI>Tayowan</HI> did not hearken to his Proposals, that then at his return he should destroy all the Sea-Port Towns which were yet in being, and to give strict Orders in all places, that not one Jonk should either come in, or go out, but if they would submit themselves to the Emperor, that then all places should be left as they were. Now this Messenger being return'd fruitless, there was such Orders given in all the Havens, that not one Vessel can either come out or in to them, which was formerly winked at.</P>
<P>Not many days since, another Messenger was sent to <HI>Tayowan</HI> (being the same of whom <HI>Ienko</HI> the Interpreter had inform'd the Ambassador at <HI>Sucheu</HI>) whose return they much long'd for.</P>
<P>The Ambassador after this Discourse invited the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> with some other that came thither in the interim to this Barque, where they were entertain'd with a Glass of <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine, which having drank they departed.</P>
<P>This <HI>Mandarin</HI> of <HI>Sincksieuw,</HI> sent the Ambassador as a Present, one Porker, one Sheep, four Hens, two Geese, a Vessel of their Drink, and some Herbs, and the Governor of the Village some Dishes of Meat ready dress'd.</P>
<P>Afternoon, the Vessels going thorow the foremention'd Sluces, the <HI>Manda|rin</HI> Guide <HI>Hiu Lavja</HI> came to an Anchor at the end of the Village, before a <HI>Pago|de,</HI> and from thence Rode to make merry at the City of <HI>Quazieu;</HI> wherefore the Ambassador seeing that this day would be spent idly, went with the Barques wherein the Presents were Laden, to the Village <HI>Palipoe,</HI> and staid all Night; but the <HI>Mandarin</HI> inform'd of the <HI>Netherlander's</HI> departure, soon after follow'd them to the foremention'd Villages.</P>
<P>This day they gain'd about three Leagues.</P>
<P>The eleventh in the Morning, they set Sail again, and pass'd by several small Towns and Villages, and also by a great Tower, with seven jutting Galleries, standing on the South-side of <HI>Tongnaphan;</HI> between which and the foremention'd Tower, a Channel runs up Westward into the Countrey.</P>
<P>Against Noon they came to the South Suburb of <HI>Iamcefu,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Iancheu,</HI> the third City of Note in this Territory, where was also a Tower with four Galleries, by which being Tow'd to the City Walls, they resolv'd to change their <HI>Coelies,</HI> having given those that brought them thither, leave to go home, notwithstanding it was late before they got new Men; yet they went away, and pass'd through a Bridge with six Arches, opposite to a Custom-House, and so Eastward, having that day been Tow'd up the River two Leagues and a half.</P>
<P>In the Morning, being the twelfth, they proceeded on their Journey about Day-break, from <HI>Yancheu,</HI> against the Stream, by and through <HI>Wantoe,</HI> a Vil|lage separated by a Channel that runs up into the Countrey of <HI>Wayopoe,</HI> or<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wayopoe.</NOTE> <HI>Stone Bakers,</HI> from the abundance of Kilns that are there; the West part
<PB N="300" REF="187">
of it being under Water, represented a great Pool, or Lake.</P>
<P>At Noon they pass'd by <HI>Sjopouzink,</HI> a Village that a far off seems a City, and also three Sluces, thorow which the Water runs out of this Channel into the Manur'd Grounds.</P>
<P>Towards the Evening, coming to a small Village of seven or eight Houses, call'd <HI>Louting,</HI> where was a Cloyster of their Votaresses or Nuns, they dropp'd Anchor, having gain'd five Leagues on several Courses.</P>
<P>The thirteenth in the Morning, leaving the Village <HI>Louting,</HI> they pass'd by many Cottages, standing on the East-side of this Channel, to the Westward of which the Countrey lay all drown'd.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon they arriv'd at <HI>Kayoven,</HI> or <HI>Kaoyeu,</HI> the fourth City of Note<NOTE PLACE="marg">City <HI>Kayoven.</HI></NOTE> next <HI>Hangcheu,</HI> where they were forc'd to stay, because their <HI>Coelies</HI> could not pass, the Ways being so deep by continual falling of Rain.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Kaoyeu</HI> lieth on the East-side of this Channel, on the brinks of the Lake <HI>Piexe,</HI> which supplies the Stream with Water.</P>
<P>Formerly, all the Ships that would go from <HI>Nanking,</HI> and the other Sou|thern Territories along the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> and this Channel up to <HI>Peking,</HI> and so to the Northern Province, were forc'd to cross the foremention'd Lake, to their great hinderance and inconveniency, being in Stormy Weather many times compell'd to stay at <HI>Kaoyeu</HI> for fair Weather.</P>
<P>But in process of time, to prevent this trouble, and that at all times the Ships might proceed on their Journey, and not be necessitated to cross the Lake, a broad Channel was digg'd of seventy Furlongs, on the East-side of it, and Wharff'd or Inclos'd on each side with Free-stone: The City stands on a Clay Ground, the same with the adjacent Countrey, very good for Rice, which they have there in abundance.</P>
<P>The Countrey to the West of this Channel lies most under Water, yet pro|duceth abundance of Canes, which serve for Fuel, for no other Wood grows here.</P>
<P>The fourteenth in the Morning, they set Sail with a stiff Gale of Wind out of the North-North-East, from the South Suburb of <HI>Kayoven,</HI> and for a quarter of a League, they had the City on their Starboard, and the Lake on their Larboard, till they were past the North Suburb; then Steering a Northerly Course up the Royal Channel, they left the foremention'd Lake on their Larboard.</P>
<P>Between this Lake and the Channel, is only a narrow Bank of three Foot high, which separates the one from the other: On their left Hand, the Coun|trey lay all under Water, yet in some places stood a few small Huts dry, being the Residence of Countrey People.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon, they past by the Village <HI>Loantsia,</HI> which lay on their Star|board; here the Countrey on the East-side began to shew somewhat pleasanter, being Till'd in several places.</P>
<P>In the Evening they Anchor'd at a Village call'd <HI>Kuisjo.</HI></P>
<P>The fifteenth in the Morning, leaving <HI>Kuisjo,</HI> they past by <HI>Laensui,</HI> and <HI>Lou|japou,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">City <HI>Paoing.</HI></NOTE> and in the Afternoon Landed at <HI>Paoing,</HI> the sixth City of Note under the seventh Metropolis <HI>Yangsheu;</HI> it lieth on the East-side of this Channel, and is surrounded with strong Walls, about a League and a half in Circumference: On the North-side of the City stands a fair Temple, neatly built after the <HI>Chi|nese</HI> manner.</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="187">Here they staid sometime waiting for fresh <HI>Coelies,</HI> which having gotten, they went farther, and in the Evening arriv'd at <HI>Kinho,</HI> where they staid all Night, having that day by several Courses gain'd five Leagues.</P>
<P>Between the City <HI>Paoing</HI> and the Village <HI>Kinho,</HI> the Bank Westward of the Channel which separates that and the Lake <HI>Piexe,</HI> is broken in several places, through which the Water rushes with such a force out of the Channel into the Lake, that they had great labor to keep the Vessels from falling there into.</P>
<P>The sixteenth about Day-break, proceeding on their Journey, they past through and by many Villages and Hamlets, lying on each side of the Channel; and about Noon, arriv'd at the West Gate of the City <HI>Hoaigan,</HI> having by Noon<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrive at <HI>Hoaigan.</HI></NOTE> been Tow'd and Sail'd three Leagues and a half in a Northerly Course. Here (as the <HI>Mandarin</HI> Guides told them) all their Vessels in which they came were to be chang'd; whereupon they immediately apply'd themselves to the Com|missary of that place, that they might be dispatch'd with what speed possible.</P>
<P>No sooner were they come to an Anchor with all their Barques, but there also Landed the Masters of the Haven of <HI>Hanksieu,</HI> which on the last of <HI>March,</HI> went from <HI>Sucheu</HI> with the Ambassador's Letter to the General, which Letter they said, they had safely deliver'd.</P>
<P>Their business, for which they came thither, was to fetch back the four <HI>Hanksieu</HI> Jonks, which were yet amongst the Fleet.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Mandarins</HI> also came to Complement and bid the Ambassador Wel|come, in the name of the Governor of that place; for which Civility they were Entertain'd with two or three Glasses of <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine.</P>
<P>In the Night there arose a great Storm out of the North mixt with Thun|der and Lightning, which continu'd all the next day.</P>
<P>The eighteenth, the foremention'd Governor invited the Ambassador and<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ambassador is en|tertain'd by the Governor of <HI>Hoaigan.</HI></NOTE> his whole Retinue to a Feast, in a great House, at the West-Gate of the City, before which they lay with their Vessels, whither they accordingly went about Noon, and were no sooner come there, but they were brought to the Gover|nor's Presence, who kindly Congratulated the Ambassador's Arrival and Health. After some other Complements were past, every one was plac'd at a peculiar Table, and plentifully serv'd.</P>
<P>Among their Table-talk at Dinner the Governor ask'd, What the Ambas|sador thought of <HI>China,</HI> and if it was not a great Countrey? Who reply'd, Yes Sir, not only a great, but a very fair Countrey, full of Fertile Grounds, and Delightful Objects: Then he began to Discourse with the Guide <HI>Mandarins</HI> (which were there present) about the Vessels: Wherefore the Ambassador de|sir'd the Governor (being inform'd before, that there were few Barques to be had there) that since he was come so far with the Emperor's Presents, having never wanted any Conveniencies, that he would be pleas'd to take care, to procure them good Vessels so soon as possible, (because he was yet to go the most dangerous part of the way) having already spent so long a time in their Journey. All which this Lord promis'd, and excusing the meanness of the present Treat, hoping when they came back from <HI>Peking,</HI> to be provi|ded for their better Entertainment. On which <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> proffer'd to Present him with a parting Cup of <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine, which he modestly refusing, would not suffer.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> taking their leaves, and departing to their several Barques, two <HI>Mandarins</HI> came to them, (which had, whilst the <HI>Netherlanders</HI>
<PB N="302" REF="188">
were Entertain'd at the foremention'd Lords, sate just over against them) to ask in the Governor's Name, if their Entertainment had pleas'd them? where|upon the Ambassador, in respect to their Master, Presented each of them with five Ells and a half of Red Cloth, which after some Complements they accepted.</P>
<P>The nineteenth in the Morning, according to the usual Custom, the Secre|tary <HI>Vander Does</HI> went with a Complementing Letter to the Commissary, and to Thank him for his kind Entertainment: The Contents were these.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe Ambassador so highly esteems <HI>Talavja</HI>'s Civility, that he cannot ex|press<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Complementing Let|ter from the Ambassador to the Commissary.</NOTE> his Thankfulness in these few Lines; but at his return from <HI>Pe|king,</HI> He hopes to find Him in good Health, when he will manifest and confess himself much oblig'd by his Lordships Favors.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The Ambassador was inform'd by the <HI>Mandarin</HI> Guides, that notwithstand|ing the Commissary had promis'd Yesterday, that he would take care to pro|vide Vessels for his farther Journey: The <HI>Touwatja</HI> had said, That there were none to be had, therefore the Secretary was commanded, that when he came to the Commissary, to desire him a second time to assist them, that they might depart with all speed, and then to go from thence to <HI>Touwatja,</HI> and ask him if any Vessels were to be had? and if he answer'd no, he should acquaint him, that they would hire Vessels themselves, for they could wait no longer; and if he reply'd, there were, then to desire him, that they might be sent to them that very day.</P>
<P>The Secretary at his return, inform'd that he had been at the Commissary's House, but could not be admitted to speak with him; but that he had given the Letter, and whatever else he had to say, to his Servant, who presenting it to his Master, brought answer, That his Lordship thanked the Ambassador for his kind Wishes; as to what concern'd the Vessels, he knew no otherwise but that the Ambassador was already furnish'd, but since they were not, he would immediately send to the <HI>Touwatja,</HI> and Order him, to procure them; which if he did not do, he would complain to the Emperor of his neglect. The Secretary had also been with the <HI>Touwatja,</HI> and enquir'd of him concerning the Barques: To which he was answer'd, That there were Vessels enough, but they lay at <HI>Sinkianso,</HI> a Village at least three Leagues from thence, and that he would send some of his Men thither with the Guide <HI>Mandarins,</HI> to look upon them, and if they were Equipt and Tight, to hire them.</P>
<P>But because the Ambassador suppos'd the Guides <HI>Mandarins</HI> not to be very expert in Naval business, he sent his Secretary with them; who returning in the Evening, brought word, That he had chose two convenient Barques for the purpose, which <HI>Touwatja</HI> had promis'd to hire, but he could find none to carry the Horses, Oxen, and their Persons, therefore the <HI>Touwatja</HI> believ'd it con|venient, that the Ambassador and <HI>Nobel</HI> should remain in those Barques which brought them thither, and go up farther in them; and the <HI>Touwatja</HI> would sa|tisfie the Owners of them for it, and also furnish them with all other Necessa|ries for their Journey.</P>
<P>As for Barques to carry the Horses, he would send for them from the other side of the <HI>Yellow River,</HI> which with the two Barques that the Secretary had cho|sen, would be there the next Morning; to which purpose, <HI>Lakka</HI> the Interpre|ter was left there, that he might come down with them.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="188">The twentieth in the Morning, the <HI>Mandarins</HI> (which the day before had<NOTE PLACE="marg">Presents to the Ambas|sador.</NOTE> been Presented with five Ells and a half of Red Cloth) came in return to Pre|sent the Ambassador with two Cowes, two Sheep, six Ducks, six Hens, four Steans of <HI>Chinese</HI> Drink, seven Pieces of Silk Stuffs, and two Silver Cups.</P>
<P>The Provisions were kindly accepted of, but the Silver Cups and Silk Stuffs he return'd.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon, the Interpreter <HI>Lakka</HI> came back without any Barques from the Village <HI>Sinkiansoe,</HI> with news, that the <HI>Touwatja</HI>'s People wrangled, and would not agree with the Owner of the two Barques which the Secretary had chosen, offering them less than their Fare; whereupon <HI>Nobel</HI> went immediate|ly to the <HI>Touwatja,</HI> to ask him a second time, What he intended to do about the Barques, and withal tell him, That he if he did not suddenly provide them with Barques, they would go and hire some themselves, or else go away with them in which they were.</P>
<P><HI>Nobel</HI> at his return brought the <HI>Touwatja</HI> along with him, who excus'd himself, that he could not yet provide Vessels for them; and desir'd, that the Ambas|sador would please to have patience till the next Morning, against which, he would send to all places, and if he could find none, they might remain in those wherein they were, and so go on in them at least two days after.</P>
<P>The next day being the one and twentieth, no likelihood of any preparati|on appearing, <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> judg'd it convenient to write to the Governor to this effect.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> hath earnestly desir'd, that the Ambassador<NOTE PLACE="marg">Letter to the Governor for Barques.</NOTE> should hasten his Journey to <HI>Peking,</HI> because the <HI>Lipous</HI> were somewhat dissatisfi'd at his long stay; now the Ambassador hath already been three Moneths from <HI>Fokien.</HI></P>
<P>The Horses, Oxen, and other Goods of the <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Presents.</NOTE> <HI>Chinkon,</HI> are subject to hurt, and may suffer in their Transporting.</P>
<P>And because the Emperor's Favor is concern'd in this <HI>Chinkon,</HI> the Ambassa|dor desires, that his Lordship would please to give Order for the speedy pro|curing of Vessels for the <HI>Chinkon</HI> to go up to <HI>Peking,</HI> or that the Ambassador himself may hire, because he can neither well answer his long stay to the Em|peror, nor his Master the Lord <HI>Maetzuiker</HI> in <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>To this Letter carry'd by <HI>Putmans,</HI> the Governor answer'd.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THat he had just cause to complain; also that he himself had sent some Barges, and that he would take further care to accommodate the Am|bassador so soon as it was possible.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>In the Evening the <HI>Touwatja</HI> came again to the Ambassador, to promise and assure him, that he should be provided the next Morning for his Journey, and therefore intreated his patience till then: To which <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> answer'd, That if he perform'd his promise, he would take it kindly.</P>
<P>The two and twentieth, the <HI>Mandarin</HI> Guides came to tell the Ambassa|dor, that the Vessels were come to take in the Horses, and Oxen, and that the Shipwrights were busie in mending and repairing the Decks. The Commissary having sent them as his own, and likewise a great Boat to put the Presents in out of those Vessels which were not in condition to go further.</P>
<P>The <HI>Netherlanders</HI> immediately going to see the foremention'd Barges, and
<PB N="304" REF="189">
finding them to be pretty good, they immediately gave order for the remo|ving of them into those Vessels, and so, all things being ready, they left the City <HI>Haoigan</HI> with seven Vessels, which carry'd their Goods and Persons, besides eight more for the <HI>Mandarins</HI> and Interpreters. Coming beyond the North Suburb of <HI>Haoigan,</HI> the Governor of the City, who was there busie receiving the Emperor's Customs and Tribute, Drank to the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> good Voyage in a Cup of Bean-Broth, which he sent Aboard by his own Servants; for which as they pass'd by him they return'd him many thanks, and gratifi'd the Servants with two Rix-Dollars.</P>
<P><HI>Haoigan,</HI> the eighth City of prime remark in the Province of <HI>Nanking,</HI> lieth on the East side of the Channel on a Plain, being all a Morass, not far from the Sea, and in the North near the Yellow River. It is but one City, yet consisting of two Parts, both which are inclos'd within one Wall: that which lies to the South is properly call'd <HI>Haoigan,</HI> and that to the North-East <HI>Yenching:</HI> It is enlarg'd by a Suburb, which on each side of the Channel extends it self above a League.</P>
<P>In this City the Vice-Roy of that Province hath his Residence, who takes care, as Purveyor, for the Emperor's Annual Provisions, and Commands with arbitrary Power over the Southern Provinces. His Office is to send for Provisions and other Necessaries from the adjacent Countrey, which in an in|credible number of the Emperor's Jonks are sent from thence to <HI>Peking.</HI> When they come to this City they are all search'd and measur'd by the Vice Roy's Order, who afterwards sends them to the Court.</P>
<P>In this Suburb are also two Custom-houses, one for Merchandises, and the other for Ships, but not for the Emperor's use. The Money which is hereby rais'd is bestow'd on the repairing of Sluces, Graffs, and Banks near several Water-falls; yet notwithstanding a great part thereof goes to the Emperor's Exchequer. On the North side of the City in this Channel are three Water|falls, of which the first and nearest to the River <HI>Hoai</HI> is the most troublesom, because out of this River the Water comes with great force; which is stopp'd by nine great Banks, that it may not overflow the whole Countrey.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Haoigan</HI> the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> pass'd by <HI>Pantja</HI> and several other Villages, and also by a great number of the Emperor's Jonks laden with Tri|butary Goods. In the Evening they arriv'd at <HI>Zinkhiunzoe,</HI> where they were to pass by a Sluce, having by Noon been Tow'd almost three Leagues.</P>
<P>The next Morning being the twenty fourth they got safely through the foremention'd Sluce, and from thence by a Village call'd <HI>Sinkjanzoe,</HI> which scattering extends it self along this Channel above a League and a half, and about Noon were in sight of the Village <HI>Namenno,</HI> or <HI>Namemio,</HI> or <HI>Neymemia,</HI> before which stood a Place of Execution, as appear'd by several Mens Heads stuck on Poles: Here they were also forc'd to pass another Sluce, which was somewhat dangerous; for coming near it, they were forc'd to stay till some of the Emperor's Barques, laden with Revenues, were gotten through. Mean while the Horses and Oxen were put ashore, for fear, as the Men pretended, when the Barques should come to the Sluce with them (where the Water, be|cause of its narrow Passage makes a great roaring) they would not stand still, and thereby endanger the oversetting of the Barques. In the Afternoon all the Vessels got safe through, yet with much trouble; for every Vessel was forc'd to be drawn with two hundred Men; for the Water on the upper, or North side is above four foot higher than that below on the South: Thus they were
<PB N="305" REF="189">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
tow'd along till they came to the end of the Village, where they Anchor'd be|fore a <HI>Pagode,</HI> where the Barque-men, according to their Custom, went to of|fer and pray for a safe Passage through the <HI>Yellow River,</HI> which they were now to enter, having this day gain'd about three Leagues.</P>
<P>The twenty fifth about Noon leaving <HI>Namemio,</HI> they cross'd the <HI>Yellow River,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Come to the Yellow River.</NOTE> which runs South-East and North-West by the foremention'd Village to the Western Shore, on which the <HI>Coelies</HI> were Landed, opposite to the Village <HI>Sing|ho,</HI> and then tow'd them North-North-West up the <HI>Yellow River,</HI> till they came to the Village before-mention'd, where they stay'd for fresh Men.</P>
<P>Mean while a <HI>Siampan</HI> or Boat came aboard with a Priest, and two Persons<NOTE PLACE="marg">Weather-makers.</NOTE> calling themselves Magicians, or Cunning-men, one of them having a Bod|kin stuck through his Cheek, and continually shaked their Bodies, as if they had been possess'd, which they made the poor People believe, also telling the Men in the Ambassadors Vessel, That they should have a fair Wind the next day, and a successful Voyage; whereupon the Master, who stood quaking be|fore them, gave them some Silver (which was all they desired) and also some Gold and Silver Paper, which he entreated them to offer to their Deity: <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> also to be rid of them, gave them some Money.</P>
<P>There are many of these sort of People in <HI>China,</HI> which by strange Gestures, and scourging of themselves after a peculiar manner, so get Alms from the Charity of the People.</P>
<P>Some lay red-hot Cinders on their bald Heads, where they let them burn so<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jugl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">rs&punc;</NOTE> long, till the stench of the Broyling offends the Spectators, whilst they by cry|ing, wringing of their Hands, and the like, enduring so great Torment, move all that are present to a charitable Benevolence.</P>
<P>There accustom also in the chiefest Cities, and Places of greatest Com|merce, especially at Annual Fairs, whole Companies of blind Beggars, which at the uttering of some Words which they mutter, strike themselves so violent|ly with a sharp and cutting Stone on their Breasts, that sometimes the Blood trickles down their Bellies.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="190">Others knock their Foreheads one against another with such violence, that they seem to crack one anothers Skulls; which they continue till fainting they fall in a Swoon, unless prevented by a considerable Alms. Some again lying along on the Ground, beat their Heads against the Stones till they have great Swellings as big as Eggs upon their Foreheads.</P>
<P>Besides these, there are many other Idle People in <HI>China,</HI> who by several Cheats maintain themselves by the Gifts of Charitable Persons. The Beggars amongst others go up and down in Companies, as our <HI>Gipseys,</HI> who for their debauch'd living are accounted as the most infamous of the Nation. Most of them are deform'd, either born so, or else made so wilfully by their Parents in their Infancy, with incredible Torture; for there are some with wry Necks or Mouths, crook Backs, long hooked Noses, or squint Eyes, and lame Arms or Legs.</P>
<P>There are likewise many Mountebanks, who use several wild Beasts, especi|ally Tygers, made tame by Degrees, on which, to the admiration of the Be|holders, they sit and ride through many Cities and Villages, which walk along the Streets very softly, with a Branch in its Mouth, which holding wide open, is very fearful to look upon, besides his Tail, which he swings to and fro, yet hurts none.</P>
<P>The Rider, who knows without either Bit or Bridle to govern the Tyger, onely by moving his Body and Feet, hath a wide Coat over his under Clothes, with Sleeves so large, that they hang down half way to the Calfs of his Legs: Over his right Shoulder comes a Girdle, which is made fast under his left Arm, in manner like a Scarf&punc; In his left Hand he grasps a Sword, with which he cuts the Air, and now waves it over his Head, and then side-ways, crying and extol|ling, like our Stage-Doctors, his Balsoms, Unguents, and Plaisters, good against all Wounds and Distempers whatsoever.</P>
<P>This Mountebank is generally accompanied with many deform'd People, some following him on Crutches, others with Rattles; most of them go na|ked; others again wear wide Coats, full of Patches of divers Colours and Stuffs; others, which is strange to behold, have stiff Wings on their Temples, on each side of their Heads.</P>
<P>IT was late in the Afternoon before fresh Toers came from the Village <HI>Singo;</HI> nevertheless the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> going forward, pass'd by <HI>Sinkiazuan,</HI> and about Night arriv'd at another small Village, containing about ten or twelve Houses, call'd <HI>Ioupou,</HI> where they dropp'd Anchor, having that day been tow'd but two Leagues and a half.</P>
<P>The twenty sixth they went by break of day from <HI>Ioupou,</HI> and came, having pass'd <HI>Conghiveao, Tsantzan,</HI> and <HI>Govetchia,</HI> the two first on the East, and the last on the West side of a River, about a Cannon-shot Southward from the City <HI>Taujenjeen,</HI> where they were forc'd to stay for fresh <HI>Coelies,</HI> having that day gain'd<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City <HI>Taujenjeen.</HI></NOTE> three Leagues and a quarter, according to the Course of the <HI>Yellow River.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Taujenjeen,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Taoyven,</HI> scituate on the Western Shore of the <HI>Yel|low River,</HI> is surrounded with broad and strong Mud or Earthen Walls, fortifi'd above with Stone Breast-works.</P>
<P>The twenty seventh they proceeded on their Journey with fresh Toers, and leaving the City <HI>Taujenjeen,</HI> went on Easterly, and at Noon pass'd by <HI>Suyt|sien,</HI> lying on the East side of the <HI>Yellow River,</HI> and also by divers Rusticks Hou|ses, which stood on each side thereof. At Noon they came to a nameless Ham|let,
<PB N="307" REF="190">
of seven or eight Houses, on the West side of the Stream, where they stay'd all Night, because the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> it beginning to blow somewhat hard, durst not venture further. This day they were got about three Leagues on|wards of their Journey.</P>
<P>The next Morning, being the twenty eighth, they reach'd the Villages <HI>Goes|jan, Pojancho,</HI> and <HI>Gousuntu,</HI> the one on the East, and two last on the Western Shore of the Stream. In the Afternoon they arriv'd at <HI>Tsinsing,</HI> where they lay still expecting fresh <HI>Coelies,</HI> being got three Leagues and a half that day on se|veral Courses. Somewhat Easterly from <HI>Tsinsing</HI> appears a fair Castle, with|in a Wall, which towards the North takes in a Mount.</P>
<P>The twenty ninth in the Morning weighing from <HI>Tsinsing,</HI> they came, ha|ving sail'd a League Westerly, to <HI>Kousango,</HI> a Village where the Channel call'd <HI>Iun</HI> takes its beginning, and discharges its Waters through a Sluce; <HI>viz.</HI> This Channel <HI>Iun</HI> begins on the Northern Borders of the Province of <HI>Peking,</HI> in the Territory <HI>Hoaiganfu,</HI> Northward from the City <HI>Socien,</HI> on the North side of the Yellow River; out of which the Ships that go to all Places in the Nor|thern part of the Empire, are brought into the Channel <HI>Iun,</HI> which spreads it self North-West from thence through the second County <HI>Iencheufu,</HI> in the Pro|vince of <HI>Xantung</HI> to the City <HI>Cining,</HI> Southward of the Lake <HI>Nanyang,</HI> then through those of <HI>Tungchunfu,</HI> and through the <HI>Nanyang,</HI> and lastly at the end of that Territory it disembogues in the River <HI>Guei,</HI> which separates the Provinces of <HI>Xantung</HI> and <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>But because this Channel in many Places is too shallow for Vessels of Bur|then, there are above twenty Sluces, which they call <HI>Tungoa,</HI> built artificially with Stone: every Sluce hath a large Water-gate, which is open'd when any small Boats or Vessels are to pass, and strongly barr'd up with Posts and Planks to keep up the Water. These fore-mention'd Gates are open'd with an Engine, or Wheel-work, with little trouble, to let the Water through, and so from one to another till they have past through, like the Sluces at our new River at <HI>Guilford.</HI> But half way before they come to the City <HI>Cining,</HI> they let as much Water out of the Lake <HI>Usianghoe,</HI> or <HI>Can,</HI> through a very great Water|gate, as they have occasion for them, locking it again, that the Lake may not be quite exhausted.</P>
<P>When the Ships come to the Lake <HI>Chang</HI> they cross it not, but go with great|er ease along a Channel made near the side, and Confin'd with two broad Banks. At every Water-gate are People, which for small consideration pull the Vessels through with Ropes. In this manner the Ships go out of the Yel|low River to <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>Certainly if the <HI>European</HI> Builders, or Layers of Water-courses, did come along this Channel <HI>Iun,</HI> and behold the thickness and heighth of the Banks on both sides, and the stately Water-gates, which are also of Free-Stone, or the firmness of the Work, they would justly admire the Contrivance and Art of the <HI>Chineses</HI> in this their way of Aqueduct, not to be paralell'd by the prime Pieces of the best Masters in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>After all the Boats were Tow'd through the fore-mention'd Water-gates, they Sail'd up the Channel <HI>Iun,</HI> in a Northerly Course with a fair Wind by the Villages <HI>Mochoctan</HI> and <HI>Uwtaotchou,</HI> the first on the West, and the last on the East side of the Channel, and in the Evening came to <HI>Maulovao</HI> on the Western Shore, having this day wrought out six Leagues and a half.</P>
<P>Here they they were forc'd to exchange their <HI>Coelies,</HI> because the other that
<PB N="308" REF="191">
came from <HI>Sinsing</HI> (a Place two Leagues and a half distance from thence) had gone their Stage.</P>
<P><HI>Van Hoorn</HI> no way satisfi'd with these delays, told the <HI>Mandarin</HI> Guides, that<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Van Hoorn</HI> is displeas'd for staying.</NOTE> they ought to have sent <HI>Coelies</HI> before, that they might have been ready against his coming thither, and then rehearsed the long time which he had already spent, when as they might have finish'd their Journey in six Weeks; all which (said he) you can scarce answer in <HI>Peking,</HI> if the Emperor's Presents should be any ways damnifi'd, which they are subject to.</P>
<P>The thirtieth at Noon, no <HI>Coelies</HI> coming, they went with some Soldiers into the Countrey to Press some of the Rusticks; which was done so leisurely, that it was almost Night before they got from <HI>Maulovao,</HI> and Sail'd the whole Night, though with a slow pace, because their Vessels often rak'd upon the Sand.</P>
<P>In the Morning the first of <HI>May</HI> they past by <HI>Kiakio</HI> and <HI>Sankomiao,</HI> two de|cay'd<NOTE PLACE="marg">May.</NOTE> Villages on the East side of the Channel somewhat up into the Coun|trey, and about Noon pass'd by <HI>Thoetsuang;</HI> beyond which they lay still a little while till their Toers had Din'd. Then going on again they arriv'd in the Evening at a small Village call'd <HI>Sjousincha,</HI> and Anchor'd before a Water-gate, having since the last Night gain'd six Leagues in several Courses.</P>
<P>The second in the Morning about nine a Clock they pass'd through the Water-gate, before which they lay the Night before, being hindred there by a strong North-West Wind. In the Afternoon coming to <HI>Twansingiao,</HI> they again lay before one of the Water-gates till the Wind was something abated. Whilst they lay there, one of the Emperor's Barques, laden with Tributary Goods, just to the Northward of the Village, was accidentally set on fire, but soon quenched, onely burning her Stern, and very little of her Lading. Towards Evening they pass'd the fore-mention'd Water-gate, and Sail'd in the Moon|shine through <HI>Singhjamiao</HI> and its Water-gates, and about Midnight Anchor'd before <HI>Wansensua,</HI> having that day gain'd but a League and a half. About day-light they got through the fore-mention'd Sluce, and at Noon arriv'd at <HI>Milanchia,</HI> where they were to pass another, but because the Wind blew very hard they cast Anchor before it.</P>
<P>This Village of <HI>Milanchia</HI> separates the Province of <HI>Nanking</HI> from that of <HI>Xantung,</HI> being seated on their Borders. Against the Evening, the Weather growing more calm, they went with their Vessels through the Water-gate be|yond the Village, at the end of which they stay'd, having the whole day not gain'd above three quarters of a League, and pass'd out of the Province of <HI>Nanking</HI> into that of <HI>Xantung.</HI></P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Xantung,</HI> being the fourth of the Northern, verges South-East and North with the Sea; and on the West side surrounded with Rivers: in the North it borders upon the Province of <HI>Peking;</HI> in the South, on that of <HI>Nanking,</HI> from which separated by the Yellow River. The remainder thereof lies inclos'd within the Rivers of <HI>Iun</HI> and <HI>Guei.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth in the Morning weighing again, they pass'd through <HI>Tsingchia</HI> and <HI>Hanghsuansa,</HI> and also through two Water-gates.</P>
<P>To the Westward, or behind this Village, a great Lake, by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Yzianghoe,</HI> takes its beginning, and through two Sluces discharges Waters into those of <HI>Iun.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening, though late, they came to the Village <HI>Tzizang,</HI> where they stay'd all Night, being got three Leagues and a half farther in several Courses that day.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="191">The fifth about Day-break they went forward, and about Noon reach'd <HI>Iaixinho,</HI> or <HI>Iaxhinno,</HI> a little Town consisting of thirty six Houses, all built like Forts, or defensive Towers. Here they stay'd some time for fresh <HI>Coelies,</HI> who being come they weighed again, and first pass'd through a Water-gate, lying in the fore-mention'd <HI>Iaixinho;</HI> afterwards through <HI>Tsonoiacha,</HI> and two Water|gates more. In the Evening they arriv'd at <HI>Maaliaeao,</HI> where they stay'd all Night, having gain'd four Leagues that day.</P>
<P>Here, as before, began to appear a Lake on the East side of the Channel. The Countrey to the Hills seeming to lie thereabouts under Water.</P>
<P>The sixth in the Morning before day setting forward again they pass'd<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pass by several Villages.</NOTE> through ten Flood-gates, and also by and through <HI>Tsouteucha</HI> and <HI>Naeyang, Lout|chiajeen, Tongnang-fong, Tsiongiaceen, Chinkio, Sinchia, Tsoufee,</HI> and <HI>Sohousum.</HI> In the Evening they arriv'd at the South Suburb <HI>Tzinningfoe,</HI> or <HI>Cinning,</HI> and Anchor'd<NOTE PLACE="marg">City <HI>Cinning.</HI></NOTE> before a Flood-gate, through which they were to pass. This day they had gain'd eight Leagues.</P>
<P>Here, according to the <HI>Mandarin</HI> Guides Saying, the <HI>Hoaigan</HI> Barques, which were in the Fleet, must be chang'd, and therefore they must stay till the Governor of the City had provided others for them.</P>
<P>Here the Ambassador, to oblige <HI>Hiulavja,</HI> one of his Guides, that he might make haste, gave him a String of Blood-Coral.</P>
<P>The eighth in the Morning the Governor of the <HI>Militia</HI> of that Place, being a <HI>Tartar,</HI> came to Complement the Ambassador; for which Civility he was entertain'd with a Glass of Wine, and at his going away saw the Horses and Oxen, which he much admir'd.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon the <HI>Mandarin</HI> Guide <HI>Hiulavja</HI> came with the two Vessels to shift and take in the Horses and Oxen, but the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> searching them, found them to be very old and crasie, and therefore sent them back again.</P>
<P>The ninth in the Morning a Grand <HI>Mandarin,</HI> a Native <HI>Chinese,</HI> came with <HI>Hiulavja</HI> to visit the Ambassador, who kindly entertain'd them: amongst other Questions the Ambassador ask'd them when they should go forward on their Journey; whereupon <HI>Hiulavja</HI> answer'd, That the City had not yet provided Toers, Rice, Money, and other Necessaries, which should be got|ten with all expedition, that they might have the least hindrance possible. But the Ambassador suspecting it to be onely delays, judg'd it convenient to send the following Letter to the <HI>Conbon,</HI> or Governor of that Place, to this effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<P><HI>THe Ambassador is arriv'd here from a remote Ploce with the</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Presents.</NOTE> Chinkon, <HI>and therefore hopes that his Lordship will forward the Iourney; for they have been a long time on the Way, and the Presents are subject to receive hurt and damage, therefore the Ambassador desires</HI> Talavja, <HI>that he would please to give order that there may be good Barques prepar'd for the Horses and Oxen, and that the Ambassador may be dispatch'd to go with all speed to</HI> Peking.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>This Letter being carry'd to the <HI>Conbon</HI> by the Secretary <HI>Vander Does,</HI> and read over, he reply'd, That it was never known, nor customary either go|ing to, or coming from <HI>Peking,</HI> to change Vessels in that Place. To which the Secretary rnswer'd, That he hop'd he would excuse the Ambassador, because he knew not the Custom, as being a Stranger; he had made this Request on the advice of his <HI>Mandarin</HI> Guides, who made him believe that the <HI>Hoaigan</HI> Barges must be chang'd here. The <HI>Conbon</HI> after this Discourse said, That all the Emperor's Goods should remain in the same Barques in which
<PB N="310" REF="192">
they came thither, and that he would give order that the Barques should be furnish'd with all Necessaries; that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> might depart when they pleas'd. He also in the Secretary's presence sent a <HI>Mandarin</HI> to the <HI>Touwatja,</HI> or Master of the Vessels, with Commands that he should immediately furnish the Barques with all manner of Necessaries, and by no means detain the <HI>Hol|landers.</HI></P>
<P>The tenth in the Morning a <HI>Mandarin,</HI> sent from the <HI>Conbon</HI> of that Place,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Conbon</HI> presents the Am|bassador.</NOTE> came to present the Ambassador with two Hogs, two Sheep, two Ducks, six Hens, two Pots of <HI>Chamzoe,</HI> or <HI>Zamzou,</HI> that is, <HI>Liquor of Rice,</HI> and some other fresh Provisions; which were all kindly accepted of, and the Bearers rewarded with three <HI>Tail</HI> of Silver.</P>
<P>About Noon they pass'd through the Water-gates, before which they had lay'n with all their Vessels, and lay still before another Sluce till the eleventh in the Evening; then setting forward again they arriv'd at <HI>Cinning,</HI> or <HI>Tzin|ning,</HI> or <HI>Cuningsiu,</HI> the fourteenth City of note under <HI>Yengche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</HI></P>
<P>This is a pleasant, though an ancient City, lying on the East Shore of the Channel <HI>Iun,</HI> in a plain and Morassy Soil.

<P>In the dark they Sail'd by the Villages <HI>Oeling, Siliphoe,</HI> and <HI>Ghansu;</HI> and in the Afternoon dropp'd Anchor at the Village <HI>Poetuen,</HI> a League and three quarters from the City <HI>Tzinning.</HI></P>
<P>The twelfth in the Morning weighing again, they shot three Water-gates, and also pass'd by and through two Villages, <HI>Longhwanghmuao</HI> and <HI>Nangwangao,</HI> lying close by one another, near the Place where the River <HI>Onghoo</HI> runs into this Channel, so that the Current which had hitherto in this Graff been against them, was now somewhat with them, by which means they reach'd the Vil|lage <HI>Poelcely</HI> that Evening; and not long after arriv'd at <HI>Koygoeva,</HI> where they Anchor'd before two Sluces, having that day gain'd about four Leagues.</P>
<P>The thirteenth they pass'd the Sluces, and so leaving <HI>Koygoeva</HI> they Sail'd through three Flood-gates, and by the Villages <HI>Inlako, Tsinti, Kingkiacouw,</HI> and <HI>Oesienno:</HI> coming beyond the last, the Wind began to blow very hard out of the North, so that they were forc'd to Anchor near the Shore to expect fairer Weather, having this day Sail'd four Leagues.</P>
<P>The fourteenth being calmer they weighed again, and Sail'd about three quarters of a League, when they came before a Flood-gate in the Village <HI>Oe|sienno,</HI> where they lay till the Evening, because the <HI>Mandarins</HI> said there was not Water enough to float the Vessels. Towards Evening they weighed again, and in the Dusk pass'd by <HI>Siliphoe, Ulchelapoe,</HI> and <HI>Oeliphoe;</HI> and in the Afternoon arriving at <HI>Toukjamtuao,</HI> they dropp'd Anchor before a Water-gate, two Leagues and a quarter from <HI>Oesienno.</HI></P>
<P>The fifteenth in the Morning about nine a Clock they pass'd the Sluces, and leaving the Village <HI>Tunkjamtuao,</HI> they came about Noon to <HI>Xantsuy,</HI> a City, where they stay'd a little while for fresh <HI>Coelies;</HI> which when come to them, they immediately went on.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Xantsuy</HI> lies on each side of the Channel <HI>Iun,</HI> which on the West side at the going up of the Trench, and fortifi'd with strong Castles built square, and about an hours walking in circumference; the Walls of Stone, strengthned with Stone Breast-works: there are also many stately Buildings, which for want of Inhabitants are faln to decay. Amongst other Edifices ap|pears
<PB N="311" REF="192">
a famous <HI>Pagode,</HI> or Temple, <HI>Teywan Miao,</HI> inclos'd within a Wall rais'd half with Free-Stone, and the other half with red and green Bricks. The Tem|ple it self consists all of Free-Stone; the Roof on the in-side is of a Vermilion colour, and on the top cover'd with yellow glaz'd Tyles; without the Walls is a standing Water, where, according to the Relation of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> some years since a stately Temple suddenly sunk, with the whole Congregation, Priests and People.</P>
<P>Towards the Evening they came to <HI>Kimonsa,</HI> and dropp'd Anchor before a Water-gate, having that day gain'd three Leagues and a half.</P>
<P>The sixteenth in the Morning they shot the Sluces with all their Vessels, before which they had lay'n that Night, and came to another about a Musquet Shot thence; through which they could not get till the Afternoon, because of the shallow Water. From thence they arriv'd before another in the Village <HI>Oasting,</HI> which they went through in the Evening; and in the Dusk arriv'd at <HI>Tsaotsing</HI> before a Flood-gate, having that day been Tow'd but three quarters of a League; it was very difficult too for the great Vessels to get through these Sluces, which were in a manner quite dry on the North side, and on the South side not above three Foot and a half of Water, which being let out, there would not remain a Foot and a quarter, when as the great Barges drew two Foot and a half so that the Water must at least be a Foot higher before they could get through; wherefore they lay still two days, <HI>viz.</HI> the seven|teenth and eighteenth; but on the nineteenth they got through, and after a little Sailing coming to the Village <HI>Gihaatsysy</HI> they dropp'd Anchor before a Water gate, having this half day been Tow'd somewhat more than a League.</P>
<P>The twentieth in the Morning they went through the Sluce, and at Noon another; and also by the Village <HI>Zoatiajeen,</HI> In the Afternoon arriving at <HI>Lieg|hayway</HI> they Anchor'd before a Water-gate, having gain'd two Leagues this day.</P>
<P>The one and twentieth in the Morning having shot the last Sluce, they ar|riv'd about nine a Clock at the South Suburb of <HI>Tungjanfoe,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Tungchang,</HI> the third City of eminency in the Province of <HI>Xantung.</HI></P>
<P>This little City of <HI>Tungchang</HI> stands in a Valley, built square, and about an<NOTE PLACE="marg">The City <HI>Tunchang.</HI></NOTE> hours walking in circumference, with defensive Walls. In it are two eminent Streets, which run cross through the Town, in the middle of which stands a Triumphal Arch, or a high Structure with four Vaulted Posterns, and as many Roofs one above another. The Gates are very strong, and have on each side four Bulwarks, which they can, when Storm'd, clear and make good. On the North side is a Bridge of a hundred and thirty Paces long, leading cross a Wa|ter that incircles the City. On the South is a very populous Suburb of great Trade. On the East stands an Iron Pillar, four Fathom and a half thick, and about twenty Foot high, Engraven at the bottom with several <HI>Chinese</HI> Chara|cters, which according to their Relation was set up there seven hundred years before, as a Monument; under which lay the Body of an Heroe, famous for his valorous Atchievements, and good Service done his Countrey.</P>
<P>The two and twentieth in the Morning they left the South Suburb of <HI>Tung|hang,</HI> having gotten fresh Toers, for which they stay'd, and Sailing a Mus|quet Shot Eastward by the City, came about Noon to <HI>Sinsia,</HI> where they An|chor'd before a Sluce, having Sail'd above a League this half day.</P>
<P>Here they were forc'd to lie all the Afternoon and the next day, before they could get through for want of Water.</P>

<P>The twenty fourth in the Morning they shot the fore-mention'd Sluces, and about Noon another; and also pass'd by <HI>Xoesu, Liancotsue, Liancotza.</HI> In the Afternoon they came to <HI>Toetsao,</HI> where they Anchor'd before a Water-gate, ha|ving been Tow'd above a League that day.</P>
<P>The twenty fifth setting forth again, they pass'd another Sluce, and about Noon they came to <HI>Woersjavaan;</HI> where taking fresh Toers they went away immediately, with hopes to reach the City of <HI>Linsing</HI> that day; but being past <HI>Ooetsjaven, Taykiasa</HI> and <HI>Tayhiaven,</HI> they saw that the Channel lay full of the Em|peror's Vessels, laden with Tributary Goods; which by reason of its narrow|ness and sholeness in some places they could not pass by, which forc'd them (though but half a League from <HI>Linsing</HI>) to stay till the Water grew higher, ha|ving that day gain'd three Leagues.</P>
<P>The twenty sixth in the Morning they went forward again, and about nine a Clock they arriv'd at <HI>Linsing;</HI> into which they went with their Barges (for the Channel runs through the middle of it) till they came before a Flood-gate, through which they were to pass, having this Morning been Tow'd half a League in a Northerly Course. All Places hereabouts lay full of the Empe|rors Barges.</P>
<P>The Governor of this Place, as the <HI>Mandarin</HI> Guides related, was depos'd, and a new one expected in two or three days from <HI>Tungchianfoe;</HI> for which rea|son they could not pass the Sluce before which they lay, it being lock'd up with Iron Chains.</P>
<P>The twenty seventh and twenty eighth nothing hapned of remark.</P>
<P>The twenty ninth, being <HI>Whitsunday,</HI> the Ambassador was told, that the Go|vernor of <HI>Tungchanfoe</HI> was come, and had taken possession of his Place; so that he thought fit the thirtieth in the Morning, for the hastening of his Journey, to write the following Letter to him.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="313" REF="193">
<P>THe <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador is come from remote Countries, and hath staid here at <HI>Linsing</HI> above four days. The <HI>Chinkon</HI> hath been a long time a coming, and by that means subject to be spoil'd; therefore the Ambassador desires, that they may with all speed go to <HI>Peking;</HI> and to that purpose the Sluces may be open'd, which will be service|able to the Emperor, and a great kindness to the Ambassador.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>Nobel</HI> carrying this Letter, related at his return, that he had been with the new Governor, who in answer to the Ambassador's Letter had told him, That he was sensible how far a Journey the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were come, and that he knew (having two years since been at <HI>Emuy</HI> and <HI>Quemuy</HI>) what service they had done for the Emperor; therefore he would not detain them, but send a <HI>Manda|rin</HI> to search the Barges (because there being a Custom-house, no Goods but the Emperors were to pass through without paying) in which the Emperors Goods were, to see if any other private Commodities were in them, or not; which should no sooner be done, but he would give them leave to be gone, and accordingly a <HI>Mandarin</HI> was forthwith sent, who at first was very earnest about searching of the Goods: But when the Ambassador answer'd him, that he might do it and begin at his Vessel, but he would permit no Chests nor Ca|ses to be open'd, he went away without looking upon them; being first pre|sented by the Ambassador with two Pieces of Linnen, which was all he aim'd at.</P>
<P>The next Morning about Day-break, passing the Sluce with all the Vessels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leave <HI>Linsing.</HI></NOTE> they went through the City of <HI>Linsing,</HI> till they came to the River <HI>Guei,</HI> or <HI>Geu,</HI> which comes from the South to another part of the City.</P>
<P>Thus they left the <HI>Channel Iun,</HI> in which they had past through forty seven Sluces, or Flood-Gates, not without great trouble, and Expence of two and thirty days time; yet according to the <HI>Chineses</HI> saying, they were gotten hap|pily and speedily out of it, because some years since, there was so little Water in that Channel, that the ordinary Vessels had been forty five, and fifty days coming from <HI>Tunchiangfoe,</HI> and <HI>Linching;</HI> which places are not above six Leagues distant one from another.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon they got beyond <HI>Linsing,</HI> which exceeds all other Cities in<NOTE PLACE="marg">City <HI>Linsing.</HI></NOTE> this County for Populousness, fair Buildings, (though on the West side it is much decay'd) and Traffique; nay, it need not give place to any City in the whole Empire, for it stands at the end of the <HI>Channel Iun,</HI> where the foremen|tion'd Channel and the River <HI>Guei</HI> commix their Waters; by which means there is extraordinary Conveniencies for Shipping, the Vessels and Barques that come Laden to this City with all sorts of Merchandize, from most places in <HI>China,</HI> here pay Custom to three Treasurers chosen for that purpose.</P>
<P>On the North side, you may see a Bridge with nine Arches, over which they pass from one part of the City to the other; one of which Arches is made so artificially, that it may be remov'd, and give Passage to the biggest Vessels, after they have paid their Custom.</P>
<P>The City (seated in a plain and Sandy Soil) hath a Mud-Wall, Fortifi'd on the top with Stone Breast-works, having on the North side fifteen Bulwarks, and two Redoubts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Porcelin Tower of <HI>Lin|sing.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Half a League from the Walls, on the North side of the City, is an exceed|ing high Tower, built with eight corners, rising from the Ground with nine Galleries, every one nine Cubits above another, so that the whole heighth amounts to ninety Cubits. The Out-Wall consists of fine Porcelane Earth,

curiously adorn'd with Imagery and Painting; the Inner, of various colour'd Marble, Pollish'd as smooth as Glass, especially the Black: The Ascent is by a pair of winding Stairs, not made in the middle, but betwixt two Walls, which hath its Entrance at every Story, and from thence to the Marble Gal|leries, and Gilded Iron Rails, which as an Ornament are made round about the Galleries; at whose corners hang little Bells, in such a manner, that being mov'd by the Wind they make a pleasing sound: On the uppermost Story stands a great Image, thirty Foot high, Cast of Copper, and Gilt, to which, being a Goddess, the Tower is Dedicated: From the upper Gallery, the whole City, with the adjacent Countrey, yield a pleasing and delightful Prospect.</P>
<P>On one side of this Tower stands a fair <HI>Pagode</HI> or Temple, worth the seeing, for the great Gilded Images which are in it.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon they were Tow'd along the River <HI>Guei,</HI> through the Vil|lage <HI>Wantouwo;</HI> and in the dusk of the Evening, they arriv'd at <HI>Ifong,</HI> a little Village, where they Anchor'd, being gotten three Leagues with the Tyde from <HI>Linsing.</HI></P>
<P>This River <HI>Guei</HI> takes its Original on the West side of <HI>Gueihoei,</HI> the fourth Ci|ty<NOTE PLACE="marg">River <HI>Guei.</HI></NOTE> of Eminency in the Province of <HI>Honan,</HI> and from thence runs with many crooked Meanders, between <HI>Xantung</HI> and <HI>Peking;</HI> and at the Castle <HI>Tiencin</HI> dis|embogues into a Bay call'd <HI>Cang,</HI> which borders on the great <HI>Indian</HI> Ocean.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>Iune,</HI> Weighing again, by break of Day they had sight of <HI>Oepoeye,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Iune.</NOTE> and <HI>Wankelo,</HI> two pretty Villages; at Noon they were Tow'd Easterly by the City of <HI>Vohincheen,</HI> but without stay; so in the Afternoon passing <HI>Sangnes,</HI> about the Evening they arriv'd at <HI>Chianmaing,</HI> where they were to change their Toers, having that day gain'd five Leagues in several Courses.</P>
<P>The second in the Morning, having gotten fresh <HI>Coelies,</HI> they set out from <HI>Chiamaing,</HI> and past by <HI>Tsasuang</HI> and <HI>Singkiakouw;</HI> and in the Evening they ar|riv'd at the City of <HI>Oesingjeen,</HI> or <HI>Uciening,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Vuching,</HI> the four|teenth City belonging to the Metropolis <HI>Tungchang,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Xantung,</HI> where they cast Anchor.</P>
<P><HI>Vuching</HI> lies Inclos'd with a square Wall on the East side of the River, having<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vuching.</NOTE> on the same a well-built Suburb.</P>
<P>This day they gain'd five Leagues and a half, according to the Course of the Stream, which thereabouts is full of windings and shallow Water.</P>
<P>The third in the Morning they reach'd the Villages <HI>Thunloo, Soenusoe,</HI> and <HI>Teckchiouw;</HI> and at Noon arriv'd at the City <HI>Taatchiouw,</HI> otherwise call'd <HI>Tachu.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Tachu.</NOTE></P>
<P>This City lieth in a Square, (as most of the other Cities in <HI>China</HI>) built on the right side of the River <HI>Guei,</HI> as you go up the same; it is inlarg'd with a fair and Populous Suburb: The City it self, though full of handsom Houses, yet hath lost much of his former Luster, suffering in the last <HI>Tartar</HI> Wars.</P>
<P>The Wall is about thirty Foot high, well built, and Fortifi'd with Bulwarks and Breast-works.</P>
<P>The chiefest Trade of the Inhabitants consists in the Brewing of (as we may call it) <HI>Chinese</HI> Beer, which the <HI>Tartars</HI> Transport from thence to other places. Here they lay still a little while, waiting for fresh Toers, which having got|ten, they Weigh'd again, and came that Evening to <HI>Soukuntang,</HI> a Village, where they staid to change their Toers again, having this day gain'd six Leagues and a half.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="194">The next Morning, being the fourth, having gotten other <HI>Coelies,</HI> they pro|ceeded on their Journey, and past by some Vessels that were come from <HI>Pe|king,</HI> in one of which was the General of the Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> sent thither to succeed him that was then there, having (in regard of his great Age) desir'd a Writ of Ease.</P>
<P>About nine a Clock they Landed at <HI>Sangjueen,</HI> where they tarry'd some time; from thence going on in the Afternoon, they came to <HI>Ghanning</HI> and <HI>Seufeukhouw;</HI> and against the Evening at <HI>Lienuchoe,</HI> where they Anchor'd, having that day gone six Leagues.</P>
<P>According to the information of the Villagers, here the Province of <HI>Xan|tung</HI> parted from that of <HI>Peking;</HI> though others will have it, that those two Pro|vinces are separated by the City <HI>Taatchiouw.</HI></P>

<P>The Inhabitants of this City Trade much, for which it stands very conve|nient: all the Ships that come out of the Sea, or from any In-land places which will go up to <HI>Peking,</HI> must pass by it, wherefore there is always an in|credible many Vessels; there is also generally the choice of all Merchandize, because this City is free for any one to Trade in, and pay no Custom.</P>

<P>The City <HI>Gioechioe</HI> is a Ruin'd place, bury'd almost in heaps of Rubbish, oc|casion'd by the last War.</P>
<P>After they had gotten <HI>Coelies,</HI> they left that City, though with slow advance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Leave <HI>Gioechioe.</HI></NOTE> because the River (notwithstanding the Wind was good) in many places (as they had seen the day before) was full of dry Sands; yet at last, passing by <HI>Sanghkiatwangh,</HI> they could (because of the Night coming on) get no further than <HI>Wanghiapan,</HI> where they came to an Anchor, having, notwithstanding they had a good Wind, Sail'd but two Leagues and a little more.</P>
<P>The fifteenth in the Morning they Weigh'd again, and with Sailing and Towing, past by <HI>Ponsinghou</HI> and <HI>Googothien;</HI> and in the Afternoon arriv'd at <HI>Goe|chin,</HI> where they staid all Night, having this day gain'd three Leagues.</P>
<P>About half a League from <HI>Goechin,</HI> lies the City <HI>Goeycen,</HI> North-West into the Countrey, which appear'd but little to the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> (for they did not put in to it) but seem'd rather like a large Castle than a City.</P>
<P>A little before they arriv'd at <HI>Goechien,</HI> a grand <HI>Mandarin,</HI> a <HI>Tartar</HI> (as it was said) Nephew to the present Emperor, came to Complement and Visit the Ambassador in his Barge; where he was entertain'd with a Glass of <HI>Spanish</HI> Wine, which having drank, and seen the Horses, he took his leave.</P>
<P>The sixteenth, leaving <HI>Goechien,</HI> they proceeded on their Journey, and pass'd by many Houses, built on both sides of the River; and also by some Villages, as <HI>Kongidieen, t' Santan, Nainaimeao, Iaumeao,</HI> and <HI>Xantiento,</HI> the Suburb of <HI>Sang|singhwey;</HI> and in the Evening, arriv'd on the East side of the same City, before a great Plain, lying between the City Walls and the River; having this day Sail'd three Leagues.</P>
<P>Here they were to lie (because the River being in a manner dry, they could get no higher) till the Emperors Order came to unlade the Presents, and go with them by Land to <HI>Peking,</HI> which was four Leagues distance.</P>
<P>The seventeenth, nothing happen'd of remark.</P>
<P>The eighteenth, several <HI>Mandarins</HI> came to Visit and Welcom the Ambassa|dor; and likewise that <HI>Mandarin</HI> which was with him on the fifteenth, which was said to be the Emperors Nephew, who gave the Ambassador two Sheep for a Fire-Lock, which he much desir'd.</P>
<P>Amongst other Discourses, <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> ask'd this Lord, If no other Ambassa|dors from any other place were in <HI>Peking?</HI> To which he answer'd, None, but some from the <HI>Corean Isles,</HI> which were shortly to return.</P>
<P>There happen'd little of note here, only the <HI>Mandarin</HI> Guide came to acquaint the Ambassador, that the next Morning Carts and <HI>Coelies</HI> would come to carry the Goods to <HI>Peking,</HI> and that one of the <HI>Lipous</HI> would be at a Town call'd <HI>Tonghsieuw,</HI> four Leagues from thence, to receive the Ambassador in the Empe|ror's Name, and conduct him to <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning, being the nineteenth, many Carts, <HI>Coelies,</HI> and Horses came to fetch the Presents, with all the Persons belonging to the Embassy, and their Goods, to <HI>Peking</HI> by Land; whereupon, the Ambassador gave immediate Order for the unlading of them, in which they spent all the Morning.</P>
<P>The Ambassador gave the Barge-men (though every one apart) which came with him and his Retinue from <HI>Sucheu</HI> and <HI>Hoaigan,</HI> eighty six Tail of Silver, with which they were very well contented.</P>

<PB N="319" REF="198">About Noon, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> set forward on their Journey to <HI>Tongsieuw,</HI> with the Presents and their other Goods, which were guarded by some Troo|pers, and between a concourse of thousands of Townsmen, Rusticks, Women, and Children.</P>
<P>About three a Clock, coming to <HI>Tongsieuw,</HI> all the Goods were put into an<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tongsieuw.</NOTE> old decay'd House, where the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> also Lodg'd, but found small con|veniencies.</P>
<P>The twentieth, setting forth by Day-light, and having Rid thorow <HI>Palikua, Swango,</HI> and <HI>Kapucheen,</HI> they came within half a League of <HI>Peking,</HI> where they were Welcom'd by one of the <HI>Lipous,</HI> call'd <HI>Liu Lavja,</HI> a Native <HI>Tartar,</HI> who kindly receiv'd them; and after some Complements, conducted them to the City, which they enter'd just about Noon in good order.</P>
<P>Coming within the Gates of <HI>Peking,</HI> they thank'd God for his Mercy, in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Come to <HI>Peking.</HI></NOTE> bringing them so great a Journey all in good Health, being a Way of many Leagues, in which they had spent six Moneths, Travelling both by Water and Land, by and thorow thirty seven Cities, three hundred thirty five Villages and thirty four Temples.</P>
<P>They were led by the Emperors Palace to the <HI>Tartars</HI> or Prime Chancellors Court, standing behind the Emperors, where all his Imperial Majesties Pre|sents, according to order were to be left; and then the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to go to their Lodgings prepar'd for them.</P>
<P>The Streets through which they pass'd swarm'd with People, thousands standing on each side of the way, which made so great a Dust (to which incon|veniency the Streets in <HI>Peking</HI> are very subject) that they could scarcely see; wherefore they were bid to sit down under the Gate or entrance of the Court, from amongst the croud of the People, which by thousands stood before it, there to stay for the Presents which were left somewhat behind in their Riding through the City.</P>
<P>Having staid about a quarter of an Hour under the Gate, and drank a Cup of <HI>Tee,</HI> the Goods came; whereupon the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were led into a Chamber, leaving <HI>Putmans</HI> and some of the Retinue to look to, and separate the Emperors Presents from the other.</P>
<P>The Ambassador and <HI>Nobel,</HI> with the rest, coming into the Chamber, they found some Secretaries sitting on a Table, which pointed to <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> to sit on the Floor; but he said, he could better stand, which they observing, bid him sit on the same Table where they sat, which he accordingly did.</P>
<P>Then the foremention'd Secretaries began to ask the Ambassador, by Order<NOTE PLACE="marg">Questions to the Am|bassador.</NOTE> of the <HI>Lipous,</HI> the following Questions, <HI>viz.</HI> Concerning his Quality: From whence the Horses and Oxen came? How old they were, and how many Miles every Horse could go in a Day? To all which Questions he gave them fitting answers.</P>
<P>They likewise ask'd who was the chief in Quality? Whether the Ambassa|dors Son or <HI>Nobel?</HI> because the General of <HI>Hoksieu</HI> had plac'd the Ambassadors Son first: To which was answer'd, That the Lord <HI>Van Hoorn</HI>'s Son, was accord|ing to the Lord Generals Order in <HI>Batavia,</HI> to have the upper place; besides ma|ny other frivolous Questions, not worthy rehearsal.</P>
<P>Mean while, the <HI>Lipou</HI> which had fetch'd in the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> came to bring them some Meat dress'd after the <HI>Chinese</HI> manner, which they kindly accepted of, having eaten nothing all that day before.</P>
<P><PB N="320" REF="199"><HI>Putmans</HI> also came to tell the Ambassador, that after the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> had ta|ken nineteen Chests with the Emperors Presents out of the Carts, the <HI>Tatan</HI> or Prime Chancellor coming thither with another Person of Quality, had forbid them to unlade any more, and that they would have the Emperors Letter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Generals and Coun|cels Letter from <HI>Batavia</HI> is deliver'd.</NOTE> which after much trouble, being found, having happily a day or two before been wrapt up in a yellow Cloth; the Ambassador bare Headed, bowing him|self three times, laid it with both Hands on a Table cover'd with Red Cloth, (behind which stood the first and second <HI>Tatan</HI>) not having time to deliver it in a Silver Charger, or any thing else of value; which done, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were again conducted into the Room in which they were before, without a Word spoke on either side.</P>
<P>Soon after, the remaining Presents, Horses, Oxen, and other Goods were dispos'd into proper places.</P>
<P>As they went to their Lodings, they were told that the Horses must be Sad|dled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Horses and Oxen are commanded to come to the Court.</NOTE> and the Oxen put into their Waggon, to be brought to Court the next Morning; because the Emperor had design'd to see them.</P>
<P>And now the Ambassador coming to his new prepar'd Lodging, was much amaz'd that there was not so much room as would hold the Goods, Horses, and Oxen, nor no convenience for himself nor his People; Whereupon chiding the <HI>Mandarins</HI> that brought him thither, he ask'd, if that was a House fit for an Ambassador which came so great a Journey, and had brought such Rich Pre|sents, and whose Countreymen had done the Emperor such remarkable Ser|vice; Withal, that it was impossible for him in that place, to take out the Sad|dles for the Horses, and also the Coach; yet nevertheless he would do his en|deavor, although he fear'd much that it could not be done.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mandarins</HI> observing the small conveniencies that the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> would have in that place, said, That they would acquaint their Master with it, and perswade them that they might have better Lodgings next day; mean|while, the Ambassador must by no means fail to Saddle the Horses, and fit the Oxen, that they might be brought to the Court next Morning; but the Am|bassador telling him that it was no way possible, unless they wrought the whole Night; The <HI>Mandarins</HI> took their leave.</P>
<P>About Midnight two <HI>Mandarins</HI> came again to the Ambassador's Lodging, sent from the <HI>Lipous</HI> to tell him, that the Horses and Oxen must be brought to the Court before Day, and if they could not be Saddled, to bring them without, for the Emperor would be there in Person to see them, which would be no small Honor.</P>
<P>The one and twentieth, about three a Clock in the Morning, one of the <HI>Li|pous</HI> came to fetch the Horses and Oxen to the Court; whereupon, they were immediately Caparison'd and Harness'd, but the Chariot being fitted up, could not come out of the Door, so that being forc'd to leave it, <HI>Nobel</HI> and the Secre|tary, conducted by the <HI>Lipous,</HI> went with the Horses and Oxen to the Court; from whence returning, at nine a Clock, they gave the Ambassador the follow|ing account:</P>
<P>That entring the Emperor's Court at break of Day, they past through four strong Gates, then they walk'd along by the Walls of the foremention'd Palace, about a quarter of a Mile, at the end of which they went through a fifth Gate into the inner Court, where the Horses and Oxen were first view'd by the chief <HI>Zoutaizin</HI> or Councellor of State, who was a brown <HI>Tartar,</HI> with one Eye, and a White Beard, about sixty years old, who, as they said, by his con|duct
<PB N="321" REF="199">
Valor and Prudence, Govern'd almost the whole Realm. He also told <HI>Nobel</HI> and the Secretary, that they should go and stand back a little, for the Emperor was coming in Person to see the Horses and Oxen, and that when his Imperial Majesty came out, they should Kneel. But the Horses stood still, held by four <HI>Hollanders,</HI> in the same place where the before-mention'd <HI>Zoutai|zin</HI> had seen them; and the Oxen also held by two, were about twenty Paces from the place where the Emperor afterward came to view them: The Grooms were likewise commanded to Kneel; a little while after, four Horses with Yellow Saddles came in at the inner Court Gate, on one of which the Em|peror sitting, stood still, just without the middle Gate of the inner Court.</P>
<P>The Emperor, according to <HI>Nobel</HI> and the Secretary's Relation, was a Per|son<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shape of the Emperor.</NOTE> of a middle Stature, pretty White, and about sixteen Years of age, not gor|geously Habited, having only a Blue Silk Damask Coat on, Imbroyder'd be|fore, behind, and on the shoulders, with Yellow Boats, looking stedfastly up|on the Horses for a considerable time; at length, drawing his Eyes from them, smiling, he spake to the foremention'd Governor about them, by which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> perceiv'd that his Majesty was well pleas'd with them. Then the Em|peror gave Order, that two of the Horses should be Rid by the Commissary <HI>Berkman,</HI> and one Horse and an Ox be brought nearer him, where he look'd up|on them with a more curious Eye.</P>
<P>After which, the Horses and Oxen being led a little way thence, his Im|perial Majesty alighting, sate down on a little Bench, in the same place where he had stood with his Horse; and likewise the two first <HI>Zautaizins,</HI> or Councellors of State, sate down about four or five Paces from the Empe|ror, on his left Hand, on Carpets of Cloth; the first of the two, was the Person that had seen the Horses and Oxen alone; the other was also a <HI>Tartar:</HI> When upon his Majesties Order a Cup of Bean Broth was given him, and also to the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> who drank it on their Knees: Moreover, the Emperor Commanded to ask them, How far <HI>Holland</HI> was from <HI>Batavia,</HI> and <HI>Batavia</HI> from <HI>Hoksieu?</HI> and also, by whom the Ambassador was sent? To which they re|ply'd, That <HI>Holland</HI> was eight Moneths Sailing from <HI>Batavia,</HI> and <HI>Batavia</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Emperor's Questions.</NOTE> about six Weeks from <HI>Hoksieu;</HI> and likewise, that the Ambassador by Orders of their Prince in <HI>Holland,</HI> was sent from the Lord <HI>Maetzuiker</HI> in <HI>Batavia,</HI> which was all that was ask'd them; But the Horses and Oxen on the Emperor's Or|der, taken from them, and led into a Stable, opposite to the Gate of the inner Court; after which, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> had leave to depart (when to their full satisfaction, they had seen the Emperor above half an hour) the same way they came, leaving his Imperial Majesty sitting in the foremention'd place.</P>
<P>Soon after, <HI>Nobel</HI> and the Secretaries return with the remaining Attendance, two <HI>Mandarins</HI> sent from the Emperor, came to desire two <HI>Hollanders,</HI> one to dress the Horses, and another the Oxen, and shew his Grooms the manner of it, which the Ambassador immediately granted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Lipou Liu-Lavja,</HI> which had the day before fetch'd in the Ambassador,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remaining Presents are sent for to the Court.</NOTE> came also to his Lodgings to tell him, That the remaining Presents must im|mediately be made ready to be carry'd to the Court; to which purpose Carts would immediatly be brought thither to fetch them; likewise, that the Lord Ambassador, his Son, and as many Persons more as he pleas'd, might come along with them, because he ought to be Present when the Goods were look'd over, to see if none were wanting, which was not needful at the Horses and Oxen, and therefore they were accepted of; whereupon, the Ambassador ma|king
<PB N="322" REF="200">
himself ready, Order'd the Presents to be put into the Carts, and went with <HI>Nobel, Putmans,</HI> the Secretary, and eleven Persons of his Retinue, towards the Court; but was first carry'd to the Council of State's House, where he had left the nineteen Chests with Presents: Here having sorted all the Goods (ex|cept five Chests with White Pepper, which the <HI>Tatan</HI> said were needless) they were sent to the Emperor's Palace; whither soon after the <HI>Tatan</HI> (who Rid before through another Gate with the Goods) the Ambassador and all his Re|tinue follow'd.</P>
<P>Coming to the inner Court, where the Emperor saw the Horses in the Morn|ing, they found the Carts with the Goods there before them, and also the <HI>Tatan</HI> sitting in the open Court. Here the Ambassador and his Attendance were also shewn to sit down on the Ground behind him, which they accordingly did, on Coats brought with them for that purpose.</P>
<P>Having staid about half an hour, the two Prime Councellors or <HI>Zoutaizins</HI> of the Emperor, came also thither, and seated themselves on their Pieces of Cloth on the Ground; and having rested themselves a little, they call'd the <HI>Tatan,</HI> who kneeling before them, receiv'd their Commands, which was, to tell the Ambassador, That the Emperor ask'd if the Lord <HI>Maetzuiker</HI> in <HI>Batavia</HI> was in good Health? To which kneeling on one Knee, he answer'd, that he was.</P>
<P>Then the Councellors ask'd, If they were all four <HI>Persian</HI> Horses, and the Oxen <HI>Bengael?</HI> And also, If the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were at Peace with the <HI>Persian</HI> and <HI>Bengael?</HI> To which the Ambassador reply'd, That they were, and had many years liv'd like Brothers, and real Friends. They also ask'd, What sorts of Grain there grew in <HI>Holland?</HI> To which they gave a fitting account. Then the Oxen were order'd to be put into the Chariot, and the Ambassadors Son to come and shew him Reverence.</P>
<P>Soon after the Presents, except the Lanthorns, were carry'd away again without the Emperor's coming to look upon them, and leave granted to the Ambassador to return to his Lodgings.</P>
<P>Mean while, <HI>Putmans</HI> and <HI>Ruwenoort</HI> staid in the Court to undo the Lan|thorns, which the Emperor, after the Ambassador's departure came to see; and likewise the Oxen drawing the Chariot, in which he Order'd two of his Atten|dants to sit, and be drawn in it; so that <HI>Putmans</HI> and <HI>Ruwenoort</HI> also saw the Emperor.</P>
<P>Several grand <HI>Mandarins</HI> went to Visit the Ambassador in his Lodgings; all which he Entertain'd with great kindness, and according to the convenien|cy of the place.</P>
<P>The two and twentieth, early in the Morning a Secretary belonging to the <HI>Lipous,</HI> came to the Ambassador's Lodgings, to tell him, That <HI>Putmans</HI> must come to the <HI>Tatan</HI>'s House to unpack the Emperor's Presents, and look them over; whereupon, <HI>Putmans</HI> accordingly went thither.</P>
<P>This Secretary humbly proffer'd his Service to the Ambassador, saying, He would rejoyce, if by his advice, or ought else, he might be serviceable to his Excellency; for which he receiv'd many Thanks from the Ambassador, who answer'd him, That he would slip no opportunity to make use of him.</P>
<P>The same day, <HI>Ienko</HI> the Interpreter inform'd the Ambassador, That he had been told from credible Persons, that he should be brought within three days before the Imperial Throne, to have Audience granted him, which although he did not absolutely believe, yet he prepar'd all things in a readiness.</P>
<P>There also came a Commissioner with four <HI>Mandarins,</HI> sent from the Prime
<PB N="323" REF="200">
Counsellor, or <HI>Zoutaizin</HI> of the Emperors, to ask the Ambassador if he had no Blood-Coral, <HI>Perpetuana's,</HI> or other Goods to Sell, because the Emperor would perhaps buy some of them? Whereupon the Ambassador reply'd, That the <HI>Ong,</HI> or General of <HI>Batavia,</HI> had strictly forbid him to sell any thing, but what he had was at the Emperor's Service: which said, they took their leave.</P>
<P>There likewise came two <HI>Mandarins</HI> to keep Watch in the Ambassador's<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambassador is strictly Guarded.</NOTE> Lodgings; so that the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were then Guarded by four <HI>Mandarins,</HI> and twenty Soldiers, that every one was kept from going out (except those whom they pleas'd) or coming into the House. The <HI>Mandarin</HI> Guides also, which since their coming thither had been Lodg'd there, were remov'd to ano|ther Place; but the <HI>Chinese</HI> Interpreter <HI>Soukjen,</HI> stay'd with them.</P>
<P>At Noon <HI>Putmans</HI> returning, said, That he had again been in the <HI>Tatans</HI> House, and laid a Piece of every sort of Goods to view, all which was Seal'd up in a Chest to shew the Emperor, and that the rest were left in Chests to be look'd over.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon one of the <HI>Lipous</HI> Secretaries came on Horseback to the Gate of the Ambassador's Lodging, saying onely to the Interpreters, That the Lord Ambassador must make himself ready against Midnight, to appear be|fore the Emperor, and to deliver the Presents himself to his Majesty: which said, he immediately hasted away again without any Answer. <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> made himself ready against the fore-mention'd time.</P>
<P>The same Afternoon <HI>Putmans</HI> was again sent for to the <HI>Tatan,</HI> that he might (as they said) take the rest of Presents out of the Packs, that they might be shewn to the Emperor altogether the next Morning, and be in readiness to be deliver'd by the Ambassador to his Imperial Majesty.</P>
<P><HI>Putmans</HI> returning very late in the Night related, That he had been with the <HI>Tatan,</HI> and had taken all the Goods out of the Chests, yet laid them in again. Moreover, he was commanded to tell the Ambassador, that he should make himself ready betimes to go to the Court the following Night.</P>
<P>The twenty eighth, two hours before Day-light, the Ambassador was with<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Presents must be shewn to the Emperor.</NOTE> all his Retinue fetch'd to the Court by some prime <HI>Mandarins,</HI> being led through three other Gates than those which they pass'd the day before, to an inner Court: having pass'd the third Gate, they saw in a great Plain before the Portals of a stately House, all the Presents set on the Ground, and close by them the second <HI>Tatan,</HI> who also pointed to them to sit down by the Presents, which they did.</P>
<P>About half an hour after the Ambassadors from the <HI>Corean</HI> Isles, being three<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Corean</HI> Agents.</NOTE> in number, came also thither with fifty Attendants, Habited after the <HI>Chinese</HI> manner, with long Hair, yet poorly Dress'd, and of mean Aspects; which were order'd to sit a good way behind the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> on the left side of the going in at the Door.</P>
<P>In the interim, whilst the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> stay'd above two hours, some Dis|course<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Discourse between the <HI>Lipou Lilavja</HI> and the Ambassador.</NOTE> pass'd between the <HI>Lipou Lilavja</HI> and the Ambassador, about a Letter which the Interpreter <HI>Genko</HI> said the Ambassador would deliver to the Empe|ror; which the <HI>Lipou</HI> advis'd him not to do, saying, That it was not customary there; for if they would Request any thing of the Emperor, they must first acquaint the <HI>Lipou</HI> with it, that they might again impart it at convenient times to the Emperor: Whereupon the Ambassador reply'd, That he would do nothing but what he advis'd him to, because he was a Stranger and knew not
<PB N="324" REF="201">
their Customs. As to what concern'd the Letter which the Interpreter had told him of, it was nothing else but a Complement of thankfulness to his Imperial Majesty, which he design'd to speak to him, and whether it would be fit to de|liver it to the Emperor before all his Business was done.</P>
<P>There likewise came another <HI>Lipou</HI> to the Ambassador, saying, That he had understood by one of the <HI>Zoutaisins,</HI> that it might happen, that the Emperor would ask the Ambassador some Questions, which if he did, he advis'd him to make short and brief Answers.</P>
<P>Lastly, the Ambassador was told, that he might again return to his Lodg|ing, because the Emperor would not that day come out to see the Presents; yet that <HI>Putmans</HI> must stay there to see the Chests and Packs open'd, if any thing should be order'd to be taken out of them; all which was accordingly per|form'd: But the Ambassador being in the last Gate to go out of the Court, was desir'd to stay a little, where <HI>Putmans</HI> came to him, saying, That <HI>Genko</HI> the Interpreter had demanded the Keys of the Chest in which the Presents were, which having open'd he was order'd to follow the Ambassador. A little after he was told, that he might go home with his Retinue, which he did, and was no sooner come thither, but he found a List written in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue; in which was set down the Provision that the Emperor allow'd the Ambassa|dor every day, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>For the Ambassador, his Son <HI>Iohn Van Hoorn,</HI> and <HI>Nobel,</HI> two Geese, four<NOTE PLACE="marg">A List of the Emperor's allowance to the Ambassa|dor's.</NOTE> Hens, three Fish, six <HI>Catty</HI> of Meal, three <HI>Tail</HI> of black <HI>Tee,</HI> a pound and a half of <HI>Waetsjoe,</HI> one of <HI>Mesoe,</HI> one of <HI>Soya,</HI> one of Oyl, nine <HI>Catty</HI> of Herbs and Gar|lick, six Cans of Liquor, and every five days a hundred Pears, five <HI>Catty</HI> of Grapes, or Raisins, five <HI>Catty</HI> of dry'd Prunes, a hundred and fifty Apricocks, and like|wise every other day a Sheep.</P>
<P>For six Men every day twelve <HI>Catty</HI> of Pork, six of Meal, six of <HI>Tauwhoe,</HI> three <HI>Tail</HI> of black <HI>Woetsjoe,</HI> one <HI>Catty</HI> and a half of <HI>Misoe,</HI> the like of <HI>Soya,</HI> the like of Oyl, and six great Vessels of Drink.</P>
<P>For fifteen Persons every day seven <HI>Catty</HI> and a half of Pork, two of Herbs, one of Salt, five Jugs of Liquor.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon <HI>Genko</HI> the Interpreter came to acquaint the Ambassador, That all the Presents being taken out of the Chests and Packs, were brought before the Emperor in his Court, where his Imperial Majesty had seen them, and accepted of them; which did not a little rejoyce the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> when they heard that all the Presents were deliver'd without any of them being dam|nifi'd, except some flaws in the Lantern.</P>
<P>There also came two Commission'd <HI>Mandarins</HI> from the <HI>Lipous,</HI> to ask if the Ambassador could about two days hence go to <HI>Zamboie,</HI> that is <HI>Complement the Emperor?</HI> and withall, to go for the Emperor's Privy Seal the next Morn|ing? To which he answer'd, That he was ready at all times to obey his Im|perial Majesties Command.</P>
<P>The Ambassador also ask'd these <HI>Mandarins</HI> whether the Emperor had ac|cepted of the Presents? and if he had done with them? To which they re|ply'd, <HI>Yes.</HI> Whereupon the Ambassador said, That he was sorry, his House being so small, he could not entertain them according to his good inclination: To which they answer'd, That the Ambassador's good will was sufficient, and that three days hence he should remove into a great House, which was prepa|ring for him.</P>
<P>The next day, being the four and twentieth, about nine a Clock a <HI>Mandarin</HI>
<PB N="325" REF="201">
came to the Ambassador's Lodging, to tell him that it was time to go and shew Reverence to his Imperial Majesties Seal: Whereupon he went thither, with his Son, <HI>Nobel, Putmans,</HI> the Secretary, and five of his Attendants, whom the fore&punc; mention'd <HI>Mandarin</HI> conducted into an old great <HI>Mandarins</HI> House that stood behind the <HI>Tatans;</HI> which when entred, they saw through one of the Palace Gates the Place where the Seal is kept, being a little eight corner'd House, and were directed to sit under the Gate, to defend themselves from the heat of the Sun; where, having stay'd half an hour, they heard a Voice bid|ding them <HI>Ascend;</HI> having pass'd on about fifteen Paces they heard the same Voice crying, <HI>Kneel;</HI> and afterwards again, <HI>Bow your Heads three times together, which done you may rise;</HI> soon after it said, <HI>Kneel down again, and once more bow your Heads three times;</HI> so that they were to bow eighteen times and kneel six; all which being pass'd over, they cry'd, <HI>Stand up, and go to your Lodgings,</HI> which ac|cordingly they did.</P>
<P>After the Ambassador had been at home about half an hour, he was told, that the chief Councellor of State, or <HI>Tatan,</HI> would be there presently: where|upon they made themselves all ready to entertain his Highness, who soon after came thither with two <HI>Lipous:</HI> They ask'd the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> by an Interpreter several Questions, <HI>viz.</HI> How long <HI>Holland</HI> had been in being? Near what Kingdoms it border'd? What Goods and Merchandises were to be had from thence? To all which his Highness receiv'd satisfactory Answers: So having spent half an hour in asking Questions, and it beginning to grow very hot in the Ambassador's little House, it being about Noon, he said that he would go home, and leave the two fore-mention'd <HI>Lipous</HI> there, to be resolv'd of some more Questions by the Ambassador; who caus'd two Pistols, one Fire-lock, and two Sword Blades to be shewn to his Highness, with Request that he would take them with him in commemoration of <HI>Holland;</HI> but he excusing<NOTE PLACE="marg">Refuses Presents.</NOTE> himself, said, That the Ambassador's good inclination was enough; which said, he departed.</P>
<P>The two <HI>Lipous</HI> ask'd him many frivolous Questions, not forgetting the least<NOTE PLACE="marg">The two <HI>Lipous</HI> Questi|ons.</NOTE> thing; nay, desir'd to know what Tails the Sheep and Hares had in <HI>Holland:</HI> in which Discourse they spent most part of the Day, the Ambassador giving them their desired Answers. After their Secretary had written down all things, they took their leave: The Ambassador proffer'd them some Presents, thereby to draw their inclinations towards him, but they refus'd them like the <HI>Tatan.</HI></P>
<P>Mean while the Emperor sent eighteen <HI>Tartar</HI> Saddles, with all their Furni|ture, to the Ambassador's Lodging, to use whilst he stay'd there.</P>
<P>The four Watch <HI>Mandarins</HI> were the same day presented by the Ambassador with a Piece of <HI>Perpetuana,</HI> and five <HI>Tail</HI> of Silver.</P>
<P>The twenty fifth the prime Secretary to the <HI>Lipous</HI> came with two <HI>Manda|rins</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ambassador makes Obeisance before the Em|peror's Throne.</NOTE> (all three Habited after a stately manner, fit to shew obedience to the Emperor) to the Ambassador's Lodgings after Midnight, to tell him, that it was time to go to the Palace: Whereupon the Ambassador went thither with most of his Retinue, which were all led through three Gates into the same Plain wherein they sat the Morning before, and there order'd to stay till Day|light, when the Emperor would appear sitting in his Throne. Having spent two hours, and the Day beginning to appear, they saw the Plain full of <HI>Man|darins</HI> richly Habited, that were come thither to <HI>Zamboie,</HI> or shew Obedience to the Emperor; so that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> divertis'd themselves with looking upon the Multitude. Having sat till half an hour after Day-break, they were con|ducted
<PB N="326" REF="202">
farther to a fourth Gate; about fifteen Paces from which they saw five Elephants, with Gilded Towers on their Backs, (three on the right, and two on the left side of the Entrance,) and likewise four of the Emperor's Wayns without Horses, standing on both sides of this Gate, which hath three Passages. They were conducted through the left Gate between the Elephants, which they had no sooner pass'd but they saw a fifth Gate, built like the fourth, but&punc; somewhat higher; to which they went by an ascent, and found it also to have three Passages, through the middlemost of which (where on the right side stood the Emperor's <HI>Palakin</HI>) they go directly to the Imperial Throne: but they were, as at the fourth Gate, led through the third Entry (because none dare go through the middlemost but the Emperor himself;) which having pass'd, they came in|to a spacious Court; at the end whereof stood the Palace wherein the Throne was erected; to which they ascend by Marble Steps. The Court was full of <HI>Mandarins,</HI> Cloth'd after the best manner, sitting in Rows one by another. On each side of the Throne stood many Umbrella's, Flags and Standards, of yel|low,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State before the Empe|ror's Throne.</NOTE> blue, and white; below the Marble Steps, on each side of the Ascent of the Throne stood about thirty Persons in a Row, Cloth'd in the Emperor's Li|very, being Yellow, and also ten white Horses with yellow Saddles, five on each side. The Ambassador and all his Retinue were plac'd on the left side of the Throne, at the end of the first Row of <HI>Mandarins;</HI> where having sat a ve|ry little while, they were forc'd to rise up to make way for some Grand Lords that were going to the Throne. About half an hour after a small Bell was heard to Ring, and four Persons making a noise, or flacking with Whips, which was just as if a Field of Canes had been set on fire. Soon after they heard a Voice, which proclaim'd something in the <HI>Tartar</HI> Language; where|upon many prime Lords and Great Persons went and stood directly before the Throne between some blue Stones (which were laid there about half a Foot high, to the number of eighteen or twenty) and upon the Proclamation of a Herald they shew'd their Obeisance to the Throne, by thrice Kneeling, and nine times bowing of their Heads: During this, a sweet Harmony was heard of several sorts of Instruments. When these Grand Lords had made their Obeisance, the Ambassador, being call'd by the Herald, was by two <HI>Lipous</HI> led with his Assistants between the fore-mention'd blue Stones, and plac'd just be|hind the sixteenth, where they could neither see the Emperor nor Throne, yet made Obeisance in the same manner as the others had done before, the Musick beginning to Play when they Kneel. This done, the <HI>Lipous</HI> went again to their Places where they sat before; but the Ambassador, his Son, and <HI>Nobel,</HI> were through a by-way led up the Marble Steps that ascended to the House where the Throne stood; where they were plac'd next to the second <HI>Tatan,</HI> or Chancellor, from whence they saw the glittering Throne, and the Emperor in Cloth of Gold, the Imperial Stool not being above fourteen Paces from the Place where the Ambassador sat. Soon after <HI>Van Hoorn,</HI> his Son, and <HI>Nobel,</HI> were presented with a Cup of Imperial Bean-Broth; which they had no sooner drank, but the Emperor rising from his Throne, seem'd to come to them, but<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Emperor rises.</NOTE> went out behind the Throne. He being a brown slender Youth, about sixteen years old, had, as the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> were inform'd, twelve Kings for his Guard. After his Imperial Majesties departure, the Ambassador also went soon after<NOTE PLACE="marg">And likewise the Am|bassador.</NOTE> with all his Retinue to his Lodgings, not without great joy (because he found himself somewhat indispos'd) that he had made an end of this grand Business.</P>
<P>Having been at home half an hour, the prime Secretary to the <HI>Lipous</HI> came
<PB N="327" REF="202">
thither, to ask him how far such and such Places were distant from <HI>Holland?</HI> and if there were any Tygers, or other ravenous Beasts in <HI>Holland?</HI> To which having receiv'd due Answers, he took his leave.</P>
<P>To the <HI>Mandarin</HI> that provided Horses for the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> and conducted them to the Court, the Ambassador gave five Ells and a half of Stammel, which he accepted of, and us'd great diligence to get it out of the Ambbassa|dor's Lodgings.</P>
<P>Since the Council in <HI>Batavia</HI> had expresly commanded, that when the Em|peror had been Complemented, and his Presents deliver'd to him, they should also present the <HI>Taisins,</HI> or Councellors of State, therefore the Ambassador pro|pos'd in Council, in what manner it was best to be done, and to which Per|sons: whereupon it was judg'd convenient, that it should be to the following Persons, because they were to assist the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> during the Emperor's Mi|nority, <HI>viz.</HI> the four <HI>Zoutaizins,</HI> being of his Imperial Majesties Privy Council,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Presents to the <HI>Zoutai|zins.</HI></NOTE> who Govern'd the Empire during his Nonage, should be presented with half a Piece of Scarlet, half a Piece of black Cloth, and half a Piece of Sky-colour'd Cloth, two Pieces of Crown-Serge, three of Cloth-Serge, ten Ells of <HI>Holland</HI> Velvet, one Quilt, ten Pieces of fine Linnen, two of fine <HI>Guinee</HI> Linnen, two large Carpets, two fine <HI>Chitsen,</HI> one Piece of <HI>Sandal</HI>-Wood, twelve Pieces of Blood-Coral, four Pieces of great Amber, one Fire-lock, one pair of Pistols, two Swords with rich Gilded Handles, one pair of Pocket-Pistols, two Pieces of Whalebone, two Rhinocerots Horns, two Unicorns Horns, six pair of Spe|ctacles, one Perspective Glass.</P>
<P>To each of the three other <HI>Tatans,</HI> or Chancellors, the chief in the <HI>Lipous</HI> Assembly, that they might impart the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Requests to the Emperor, were presented half a Piece of Crimson, half a Piece of black, and half a Piece of sky-colour'd Cloth, one Piece of black Cloth&punc; Serge, one of Crown-Serge, one Piece of <HI>Sandal</HI> Wood, ten Ells of green Velvet, six Pieces of <HI>Adathiis,</HI> two of fine <HI>Guinee</HI> Linnen, two Carpets, one String of Amber Beads, three Pieces of great, and three of small Blood-Coral, two great Pieces of Amber, one Sword-Blade, one pair of Pistols, two Unicorns Horns, two Rhinocerots Horns, one Perspective Glass, six pair of Spectacles, and some Glass&punc; works.</P>
<P>To each of the three <HI>Lipous,</HI> or Speakers for Strangers, acting in all Ambas|sador's<NOTE PLACE="marg">Presents to the <HI>Lipous.</HI></NOTE> Affairs, were presented half a Piece of Crimson, half a Piece of black, and half a Piece of sky-colour'd Cloth, one Piece of Cloth-Serge, one of black Crown-Serge, ten <HI>Dutch</HI> Silk-Stuffs, four Pieces of <HI>Adathiis,</HI> one of <HI>Guinee</HI> Lin|nen, one Carpet, one ordinary String of Amber Beads, six Pieces of Blood-Coral, one great Piece of Amber, one pair of Pistols, one Carbine, one Sword-Blade, and two Rhinocerots Horns.</P>
<P>Every one of the Secretaries belonging to the <HI>Lipous</HI> were presented with ten<NOTE PLACE="marg">Presents for the Secre|taries.</NOTE> Ells of Stammel, one Piece of Cloth-Serge, one of <HI>Perpetuana,</HI> one Carpet, two Pieces of <HI>Adathiis,</HI> one of <HI>Guinee</HI> Linnen, one String of ordinary Amber Beads, one Sword-Blade, two Rhinocerots Horns, one Carbine, and one Piece of Crown-Serge.</P>
<P>And that the Inventories of the Presents should be safely deliver'd, and the Ambassador no way cheated therein, it was order'd that <HI>Nobel</HI> should go thither with the first opportunity, to deliver them in his own Person, and send a <HI>Dutch</HI> Letter with them, that they might shew it by such Person as they pleas'd the Ambassador should deliver their Presents to.</P>
<P>The twenty sixth in the Morning, <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Putmans</HI> were sent for to the<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Putmans</HI> are sent for to the <HI>Lipous.</HI></NOTE>
<PB N="328" REF="203">
Assembly of the <HI>Lipous;</HI> whither (having acquainted the Ambassador with it) they went, and at their Return related, That they had been before the three <HI>Lipous,</HI> who sat in Consultation of their Business; where they were ask'd if the Ambassador had ought to request of the Emperor, by order of the Lord <HI>Maet|zuiker</HI> in <HI>Batavia?</HI> and if he intended to present the Emperor with any thing else? if so, he should write down his Requests, and the Presents which he would give, and come with <HI>Nobel</HI> the next Morning to their Assembly and de|liver it himself, that hereafter he might not trouble them with any more Re|quests. Moreover, they ask'd if the Lord <HI>Maetzuiker</HI> had written a Letter to the <HI>Pou</HI> of <HI>Hoksieu?</HI> To which they replying <HI>Yes,</HI> said that the Contents thereof was unknown to them, but that the Ambassador might perhaps inform them of it. They inquir'd also the difference in Quality between the Ambassa|dor's Son and <HI>Nobel,</HI> which was answer'd according to the truth. The <HI>Lipous</HI> also said, that Carts and <HI>Coelies</HI> should come the next day to fetch their Goods out of their straitned Lodgings, and carry them to a greater.</P>
<P><HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Putmans</HI> acquainting the Ambassador herewith, he call'd his Council, where they seriously consider'd their Instructions: whereupon it was first judg'd no way convenient to complain of the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong,</HI> as was mention'd in them, because of the great Power which he had in that Place, by which means there might arise a confusion, and a hatred against them, and a great prejudice if the Trade should be forbid them in <HI>Hoksieu.</HI> Moreover, since the General there was already depos'd, and the Vice-Roy con|demn'd to pay two thousand <HI>Tail</HI> for suffering the <HI>Netherland</HI> Ships to go away, they ought by no means to be the occasion to bring any more trouble upon him. Nay, though the Ambassador would have fulfill'd his Instructions he could not do it, because none (as fearing to incur displeasure) would have translated it into the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue.</P>
<P>Many other Complaints mention'd in the Instructions were thought fit not to be taken notice of till a more convenient opportunity, they being com|manded to set down onely what they had to request of the Emperor. All which being rightly consider'd of, it was concluded to write the following Points, and get them translated into the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue, that the Ambassador and <HI>Nobel</HI> might the next Morning carry them to the <HI>Lipous,</HI> viz.</P>
<P>The Realm of <HI>Holland,</HI> and the General of <HI>Batavia</HI> have commanded the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Requests of the Ambas|sador to the Emperor.</NOTE> Ambassador to request of his Imperial Majesty the following Points:</P>

<ITEM><HI>IV.</HI> That the Silk and Silk-Stuffs may be Bought and Transported by the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> as also all other Merchandise, except those which the Emperor pleases to prohibit, of which the Ambassador desires he may have knowledge, that they may obey the Emperor's Will and Pleasure.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>V.</HI> That the <HI>Holland</HI> Ships, so soon as they are arriv'd, may Trade and go away again when they are ready.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>VIII.</HI> That the fore-mention'd Particulars may be ratifi'd with Seal'd Letters from the Emperor, and that his Vice-Roys may be commanded to observe and take notice of them: Which if the Emperor grant, the Ambassador hath Order to consult farther about the <HI>Chinkon.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Moreover, the Ambassador propos'd, if he ought not for his particular part to present the Emperor (because it was customary there;) which being approv'd of, they set down the following Presents, <HI>viz.</HI> four Strings of Am|ber<NOTE PLACE="marg">Presents to the Empe|ror.</NOTE> Beads, one Amber Box, one Silver Charger, one Silver Box with Mother of Pearl, four <HI>Casuaris</HI> Eggs, ten Pieces of yellow Cloth, two double Barrel'd Pistols, two Pocket Pistols, two Sword Blades, one Buff Coat, twenty Flasks of Rose-water, four Perspective Glasses, six Pieces of <HI>Calamback</HI> Wood, two Unicorns Horns, one Piece of Amber, one Copper Horse upon a Pedestal, one Copper Lyon, two Copper Dogs, one Copper Mount, one <HI>Persian</HI> Quilt, two small Mortar-Pieces.</P>
<P>The twenty seventh in the Morning the Ambassador and <HI>Nobel</HI> were fetch'd by a <HI>Mandarin</HI> to the <HI>Lipous</HI> Assembly; where coming, they were led into an Anti-Chamber, and from thence, after half an hours stay, to the <HI>Lipous;</HI> to whom, after the delivery of the several Requests, and Inventory of the Pre|sents, they were again led to the fore-mention'd Chamber, without a word speaking on either part.</P>
<P>A little while after there came two <HI>Lipous</HI> to ask the Ambassador some<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Questions of two <HI>Lipous</HI> to the Ambas|sador.</NOTE> Questions by the <HI>Tatans</HI> Order, <HI>viz.</HI> That the <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassadors were in the thirteenth Year of the Emperor <HI>Zungte</HI> order'd to come by <HI>Quantung,</HI> and he was now in the fifth Year of <HI>Conchi</HI> come thither from <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> why he did not come by <HI>Quantung?</HI> also which way was nearest, from <HI>Quantung</HI> or <HI>Hoksieu?</HI> The Ambassador answering these, desir'd that if they had any more Questions to ask him, they would please to deliver them to him in Writing, that he might answer them again in the same manner, that by that means all mistakes, which might happen to arise by the Interpretation of them, might be prevented. This the <HI>Lipous</HI> willingly consenting to, deliver'd them a Paper written in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue, in which the Questions were all set down.</P>
<P><HI>Van Hoorn</HI> and <HI>Nobel</HI> going from thence went to their new Lodgings, which<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambassador goes to his new Lodgings.</NOTE> were the same wherein the Ambassadors <HI>Goyer</HI> and <HI>Keizer</HI> had Lodg'd thirteen years before, and now also the four <HI>Corean</HI> Ambassador, who went from thence the day before, having been there a whole Moneth.</P>
<P>The Place whereon this House was built being of a large circumference, was surrounded with Stone Walls, and full of Chambers and other Apart|ments; yet very inconvenient, though better than where they were before.</P>
<P>Soon after their coming into this their new Habitation, the <HI>Lipous</HI> which had been there before, came again with their Secretary, to tell the Ambassador, that the <HI>Tatan</HI> would come in Person and see those Presents which the Ambassador would present to the Emperor apart, that he might give the better account of them to his Imperial Majesty. To which the Ambassador reply'd, That so soon as the Goods came thither, he would lay them ready for him.</P>
<P>Not long after <HI>Putmans</HI> and <HI>Vander Does</HI> came thither with all the remaining Presents and other Goods: whereupon the Ambassador gave immediate order,
<PB N="330" REF="204">
that those new Presents which he had design'd to give the Emperor, should be taken out of their several Chests: which was no sooner done, but the <HI>Tatan</HI> came with several great Lords; where looking on all the Goods, he ask'd from whence this or that came, and what use it was for? to which Question having receiv'd an Answer, he took his leave; but coming just without the Gate he sent one of his Secretaries to tell the Ambassador, that he must get the Presents all in readiness against the next Morning, if the Emperor should chance to send for them.</P>
<P>The twenty eighth about Day-break, a <HI>Mandarin</HI> came to the Ambassador to have a written Answer to the Questions deliver'd in Writing the day before by the Chancellor and <HI>Lipous</HI> to the Ambassador and <HI>Nobel:</HI> whereupon the Ambassador causing them immediately to be translated, found them to be as followeth; and thereupon judg'd it convenient to answer according to what was there written, under every Question.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Emperor and <HI>Lipous</HI> ask of the Ambassador and <HI>Hopou</HI> these following Questions.</HEAD>
<P>I. <HI>Question.</HI> In the thirteenth Year of the Emperor <HI>Zungte,</HI> the <HI>Holland</HI> Am|bassadors came to <HI>Quantung.</HI> The <HI>Lipous</HI> in the same Year writ to the Empe|ror, and he hath granted that the Ambassadors shall always come by the way of <HI>Canton.</HI> In the fifth Year of the Emperor <HI>Conghi,</HI> the Ambassador is come from <HI>Hoksieu;</HI> and why did he not come from <HI>Canton?</HI></P>
<P>Answer. <HI>Because the</HI> Hollanders <HI>in the Wars, and routing of the Pyrate</HI> Coxinga, <HI>put into</HI> Hoksieu.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Qu.</HI> Which Way is nearest, from <HI>Quantung,</HI> or <HI>Hoksieu?</HI></P>
<P>Answ. <HI>The Way from</HI> Quantung <HI>is three or four days nearer; yet that is according as the Winds blow.</HI></P>
<P>III. <HI>Qu.</HI> If the Way from <HI>Quantung</HI> be three or four days nearer than from <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> why did not the Ambassador come from thence?</P>
<P>Answ. <HI>The reasons thereof are mention'd in the Answer to the first Question.</HI></P>
<P>IV. <HI>Qu.</HI> In the thirteenth Year of the Emperor <HI>Zungte,</HI> the <HI>Holland</HI> Ships were in <HI>Quantung,</HI> and since there are many Shelves and Rocks, how did they get through them?</P>
<P>Answ. <HI>Concerning the Rocks, and being at</HI> Quantung, <HI>we can say nothing of them, because neither the</HI> Hopou <HI>nor Ambassador were there; but yet they both know that some of the</HI> Holland Ships <HI>were cast away there.</HI></P>
<P>Whilst they were answering these Questions, two <HI>Lipous</HI> came to the Am|bassadors<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Two Lipous</HI> ask several Questions of the Ambassa|dor.</NOTE> House, asking a Pattern of each sort of the peculiar Presents which the Ambassador intended to give to the Emperor, that they might shew it; which being given them, they again ask'd some other Questions, from whence this thing or that came? and what use it was for? as the <HI>Tatan</HI> had done the day before. To which they receiv'd Answers as formerly. Soon after they be|gan to Pack up all the Goods to be carry'd to the Court.</P>
<P>The Ambassador taking hold of this opportunity, judg'd it convenient (since two days before he could not have any time) to deliver the <HI>Zoutaizins, Tatans,</HI> and others, the Inventories of their Presents; which was done accor|dingly, after the Ambassador had taken both of them apart from the other <HI>Mandarins:</HI> but they (notwithstanding all the arguments that could be us'd to perswade them to accept of them) excus'd themselves, saying they could not
<PB N="331" REF="204">
as yet take them, alledging that they would stay till they had done the Am|bassador's Business. This said, they ask'd if the Ambassador had brought any thing to sell? and also if any of his Retinue had any thing to dispose of, which if they had, they should give them the quantity of them in Writing, before they sold their Goods, which (as they said) was the Custom there of all Stran|gers. Whereupon the Ambassador gave them the same Answer as he had done on the two and twentieth, <HI>viz.</HI> That they had nothing to sell, but that which they brought with them was to give away to Persons that assisted them in the obtaining of their Desires. Whereupon they looking upon one another, said nothing, but that they durst not accept of the Presents.</P>
<P>Moreover, the Ambassador requested that they would please to order him<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambassador's Requests&punc;</NOTE> a certain Purveyor, to buy all his Provisions and other Necessaries for him and his Retinue, because they could not agree with those that were there then, by reason they were chang'd every day; and likewise that they might have a Carpenter to make some Conveniences for them. The first they granted, tel|ling them of two Persons which should assist them; but the second they could not consent to, because (as they said) none might come into the Ambassadors House whilst the Emperor's Presents were there.</P>
<P>They also ask'd for an Answer to their Questions made the day before; to which the Ambassador reply'd, That it was ready to be deliver'd to them so soon as it was Translated: To which they answer'd, That when it was done they should deliver it to the <HI>Mandarins</HI> whom they would send; which soon after was perform'd: and they took their leave without taking any of the Emperor's Presents with them, which the Ambassador had Pack'd up: neither was it done till the twenty third, when by three Secretaries belonging to the <HI>Lipous,</HI> they were with the rest of the Presents (according as they said) to be deliver'd all together to the Emperor.</P>
<P>The thirtieth the Ambassador and <HI>Nobel</HI> were sent for to the <HI>Lipous,</HI> and car|ry'd<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambassador and <HI>Nobel</HI> brought before the <HI>Lipous.</HI></NOTE> to the chief <HI>Tatan</HI>'s House, where they commonly assembled; whither coming, after a little waiting, they were ask'd by the <HI>Tatan</HI> if they had any Goods to buy or to sell? To which they answer'd, <HI>No;</HI> and that it was not customary for any Ambassador to trouble himself with Merchandizing. Whereupon the <HI>Tatan</HI> ask'd how it was with the Ambassador's Health: after which his Excellency and <HI>Nobel</HI> were carry'd into an Anti-Chamber; where being seated, they ask'd the Ambassador concerning his Sons Quality? and if<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Questions.</NOTE> he came upon order and knowledge of the Lord General. To which <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> reply'd, That his Son was of no Quality more than as being his, and that he onely came to bear his Father Company, which the General had given him leave to do. Moreover, they ask'd why this Embassy did not come by <HI>Quan|tung</HI> and <HI>Canton,</HI> but from <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> alledging that they were not well satisfi'd in the written Answer to this Question, because they had not ask'd about the War with the <HI>Coxingans,</HI> and if they were come thither by that means; but why the Embassy did not now come by <HI>Quantung?</HI> and if they and the Lord <HI>Maet|zuiker</HI> did not know that the former Emperor's Order was, that all Embassies must come from <HI>Quantung?</HI> Whereupon after consultation they answer'd, That they knew not of the former Emperor's Order; and that according to the Lord Generals Command they were come by <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and whether or not he knew the former Emperor's Order they could not tell. Which Answer they said was sufficient, and accordingly written down. They also ask'd con|cerning <HI>Putmans</HI> and the Secretary's Quality; which being resolv'd, the Am|bassador and <HI>Nobel</HI> took their leave.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="205">The first of <HI>Iune</HI> in the Morning one of the <HI>Lipous</HI> call'd <HI>Songlavja,</HI> and four<NOTE PLACE="marg">Iune.</NOTE> Grand <HI>Mandarins,</HI> came to the Ambassador's House, with Request that he would command his Musick to Play, which they much desir'd to hear.

<P>In the Evening the Ambassador propos'd, That they had made some In|ventories<NOTE PLACE="marg">Consult about present|ing the Council of State.</NOTE> of Presents for the four <HI>Zoutaizins,</HI> three <HI>Tartar Tatans,</HI> three <HI>Lipous,</HI> and four Secretaries; and that their Letter of Requests was, as they reported, already deliver'd to the Emperor, and that in a short time they might have an Answer; that also in their Instructions they were order'd to present the Coun|cellors of State before their chief Business was done, as the Ambassador had al|ready us'd some endeavor to deliver the Schedule of the Presents, without being able to do it; as also by one of their <HI>Mandarin</HI> Guides to the <HI>Zoutaizins,</HI> which likewise came to no effect: Whereupon considering, that they could trust none without being cheated, it was therefore propos'd what way would be best to present the Councellors: After serious Debate it was resolv'd, that <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Putmans</HI> should the next Morning go to the <HI>Lipous,</HI> and acquaint them, That the Ambassador rejoyc'd at the Emperor's kind acceptance of all the Presents, and withal desir'd, there being some Presents for the <HI>Zoutaizins</HI> and other Grandees, sent them from the General, that they might be acquaint|ed with it, and they admitted to deliver them. Whereupon the <HI>Mandarins</HI> of the Guard were call'd, and desir'd by the Ambassador, that they would go to the <HI>Lipous</HI> in the Morning, and request of them, that <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Putmans</HI> might be admitted to impart something to them; which they promis'd to do, and said they would bring the Ambassador an Answer at their Return.</P>
<P>The second in the Morning the <HI>Mandarins</HI> return'd to tell the Ambassador, that <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Putmans</HI> might freely go to the Assembly, and that a <HI>Mandarin</HI> was come to conduct them thither. Whereupon they immediately went, and at their Return related, That they were carry'd by the fore-mention'd <HI>Manda|rins</HI> to the <HI>Tatans</HI> House into a Chamber, by the <HI>Lipou Songlavja,</HI> who had ask'd them if they would acquaint him onely with their Requests, or the whole As|sembly? to which they answer'd, That they would do as he pleas'd: where|upon he desir'd that they should onely impart it to him, which was done after the same manner as it was agreed on the Night before: which having heard, he went in, and after half an hours stay coming out again, and sending away all his Servants, he told them, That for that time the <HI>Lipous</HI> were risen, but the <HI>Tatan</HI> had promis'd to propose it to the Assembly in the Afternoon, and would send them an Answer the next Morning, whethe <HI>Nobel</HI> should come to the Assembly or not; and if no Messenger came, he migh tstay at home. <HI>Songlavja</HI> had also ask'd several times if the Lord General had sent the Presents? and if there were no Letters with them. To which <HI>Nobel</HI> replying, said, That there were none; but he knew that the Ambassador was commanded by the Lord <HI>Maet|zuiker</HI> to present all the fore-mention'd Grandees: which said, they took their leave.</P>
<P>The third, two <HI>Mandarins</HI> came to tell the Ambassador, That the <HI>Lipous</HI> on the Proposal of the Presents made yesterday by <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Putmans,</HI> desir'd that he would write the Persons Names which he intended to present, and if they were sent from the General, or given onely by the Ambassador: To which he sent an Answer in these following terms:</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="333" REF="205">
<P>THe General of <HI>Batavia</HI> hath commanded the Ambassador, after the delivery of<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Letter to the <HI>Taisins</HI> concerning the Presents.</NOTE> the <HI>Chinkon</HI> to the Emperor, also to Present the <HI>Taizins;</HI> for he being ignorant of the Customs here, hath order'd the Ambassador to do according as he shall find it con|venient.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>With which Letter <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Putmans</HI> went to the <HI>Lipous</HI> Assembly, and at their Return brought word, That they had again, as yesterday, been at the <HI>Tatans</HI> House, and by two <HI>Lipous</HI> led into a private Chamber, where they deli|ver'd the fore-mention'd Letter; which when they had read they deliver'd to <HI>Nobel</HI> again. Whereupon <HI>Nobel</HI> desir'd of the <HI>Lipou Songlavja</HI> (which was one of the two) that he would be pleas'd to assist the Ambassador, he not know|ing their Customs, and advise him what was best to be done: At which seem|ing not to be well pleas'd, he went to the Council, whither <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Putmans</HI> was also call'd: There they saw three <HI>Tatans,</HI> being two <HI>Tartars</HI> and one <HI>Chi|nese,</HI> to whom they again deliver'd the fore-mention'd Letter: The <HI>Tatans</HI> ha|ving read it, ask'd to whom they would deliver the Presents? <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Putmans</HI> desir'd that they might speak with the Ambassador about it: But they ma|king no Answer went away without effecting their Business, the Letter being also by the <HI>Tatans</HI> demanded from the Interpreter <HI>de Hase,</HI> to whom they had first given it.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon a <HI>Mandarin,</HI> whom <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> had some days since present|ed with five Ells of Stammel, came and brought it again, saying, When the Ambassador's Business was done he would take it, but now he durst not keep it. He also inform'd the Ambassador, that he was come of his own ac|cord to tell him, that the Letter to the <HI>Lipous</HI> to present the <HI>Zoutaizins</HI> did not please them; nay, that they would perhaps send some <HI>Lavja's,</HI> to ask how and where the Ambassador heard of the <HI>Zoutaizins?</HI> and advis'd him to answer them, That he suppos'd the <HI>Zoutaizins, Tatans,</HI> and <HI>Lipous,</HI> were all one.</P>
<P>The Ambassador look'd upon this as a strange Discourse, because he had seen the <HI>Zoutaizins,</HI> and they ask'd him concerning the General's Health; so that he suppos'd the <HI>Lipous</HI> did this onely to prevent him from presenting the <HI>Zoutaizins,</HI> and get the Presents amongst themselves.</P>
<P>The twenty ninth in the Morning <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> and <HI>Nobel</HI> were sent for to the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambassador and <HI>Nobel</HI> appear before the <HI>Lipous.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Lipous,</HI> and carry'd before their Bench, where they were ask'd what Lords the Ambassador meant by the Name of <HI>Zoutaizins?</HI> and how they knew that there were any? To which he answer'd, That he had seen two of them in the Em|peror's Palace, and they told him that there were two more, which were then sick; and also that he had spoke to them when they ask'd him about the Gene|ral's Health. To which the <HI>Lipous</HI> said, Mean you them? Whereto <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> reply'd, So he understood his Orders.</P>
<P>Moreover they desir'd that the Ambassador would declare what <HI>Lipous</HI> he meant by the other, and that he would express the <HI>Lipous</HI> thereby; which was done accordingly. This pleasing them, the Ambassador was by some of the <HI>Lipous</HI> led out of the Council Chamber into a private Room, and there told, That in the second Year of the Emperor <HI>Conghi,</HI> a <HI>Mandarin</HI> call'd <HI>Tanghlavja,</HI> had been in <HI>Hoksieu</HI> impower'd as <HI>Taizin,</HI> and had brought word that they would every year come to <HI>Peking;</HI> whether or no that was true? To which <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> answer'd, That that was not the meaning, but that they would come every year to Trade. So after several other Questions of small conse|quence, the Ambassador and <HI>Nobel</HI> took their leave.</P>
<P><PB N="334" REF="206">The fifth in the Morning the Ambassador and <HI>Nobel</HI> were again sent for to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ambassador and <HI>Nobel</HI> again sent, for to the As|sembly of the <HI>Lipous.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Lipous,</HI> and coming to the <HI>Tatans</HI> House were led into an Apartment, out of which after two hours stay they were call'd before the Assembly; where the <HI>Tatan</HI> first ask'd concerning the Ambassador's Health, and afterwards said, That it had often hapned that Ambassadors proffer'd to present the <HI>Zoutaizins</HI> and <HI>Lipous,</HI> but it was not customary there to receive them, therefore the Am|bassador must not credit those which told him so, and that they had not ad|vis'd him well: after these and such like Discourses were ended, they departed.</P>
<P>In the Evening the <HI>Mandarin,</HI> who had hitherto been chief Steward for the Ambassador's Provisions that were allow'd him and his Retinue by the Empe|ror, came to tell him, That being preferr'd to a greater Place, he could not wait upon him any longer, but that another would supply his Room: The Ambassador to gratifie him for his former care, gave him five Ells of Stammel.</P>
<P>The sixth in the Afternoon came four <HI>Mandarins</HI> to the Ambassador, to tell him that they were expresly sent from the Emperor, to have his Answer to the following Questions, <HI>viz.</HI> First, from whence the Rose-water came, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Questions of four <HI>Mandarins</HI> to the Ambassador.</NOTE> what it was for? likewise the Unicorns Horns and the Copper Mount, which were amongst the <HI>Bengale</HI> Copper-works? Moreover, what Birds the <HI>Casuaris</HI> were? all which the Ambassador answer'd to the best of his knowledge; which they having set down, went away again.</P>
<P>The seventh and eighth nothing hapned, nor saw they any Strangers.</P>
<P>The ninth in the Afternoon <HI>Genko</HI> the Interpreter inform'd the Ambassador, That he and the <HI>Mandarin</HI> Guides were that Morning sent for to the <HI>Lipous,</HI> where they had understood that the Ambassador and all his Retinue should about three days after be invited to the Emperor's first Feast, and perhaps with|in ten days go away again.</P>
<P>The eleventh nothing hapned of note; but on the twelfth in the Morning<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ambassador and his Retinue are fetch'd to the Imperor's Feast.</NOTE> a <HI>Mandarin</HI> (which generally went with the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> to the Court) came to tell the Ambassador, That he and his Retinue should make themselves rea|dy to go to the fore-mention'd Feast of the Emperor; which was immediate|ly perform'd, and the Ambassador conducted to the <HI>Tatans</HI> House, to stay in the usual Chamber; from whence he was soon fetch'd, and by the <HI>Lipou Song|lavja</HI> led into the Hall, where finding the <HI>Tatan,</HI> and having with him kneel'd down and bow'd their Heads three times towards the Emperor's Palace, they were seated after the following manner: The <HI>Tatan</HI> sat uppermost, and on his right Hand a little distant the Ambassador, behind him <HI>Nobel, Putmans,</HI> and the Secretary, and behind them the rest of the Retinue, to the number of seven|teen; on the <HI>Tatan</HI>'s left Hand, at a pretty distance sat some <HI>Lipous,</HI> and other great Lords: When they were plac'd, a Cup of Bean-broth was fill'd round, and drank up kneeling with one Knee on the Ground; after which the Ta|bles, Garnish'd with thirty three Silver Plates, were plac'd before the <HI>Tatan,</HI> Ambassador, and those of his Retinue that were of Quality, and before the other Retinue five and five to a Table, fill'd with all manner of Fruits, and Meal Bak'd in Oyl; then every one receiv'd a Cup of Imperial Liquor, which was also drank by those that lik'd it on the Knee, after they had bow'd their Heads; which done, they fell to eat, the <HI>Tatan</HI> giving the <HI>Lipous</HI> and other great Lords some from his own Table. After they had pretty well eaten, the <HI>Tatan</HI> ask'd the Interpreters, if the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> had brought no Bags to put the Offal, and what remain'd in? being answer'd <HI>No,</HI> and that it was not their

custom, he immediately caus'd some Bags and Clothes to be brought: But the Interpreters not long considering, threw in all that was left one amongst another into the Bags; which was no sooner done, but another Course was brought, <HI>viz.</HI> on the <HI>Tatan</HI>'s, Ambassador's, and other Persons of Qualities Table, were set two Dishes and two Plates; on the Retinues Tables, one Dish of boyl'd Rams flesh, and another of Lamb: Before the <HI>Lipous</HI> and other Lords, a Mat was spread on the Floor, without either Table or Dish, the flesh exceeding fat and good, though unhandsom to look on, weigh'd at least fifteen Pound a Joynt.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> were much pleas'd to see the <HI>Lipous</HI> and other Lords eat so heartily thereof; also observing the manner us'd by the <HI>Tartars</HI> at Meals, which was rather like Beasts than rational Creatures: Having spent some time in Eating, the Souldiers taking away the Meat from the Tables, the <HI>Ne|therlanders</HI> rising and kneeling, bow'd their Heads, with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> three times towards the Emperor's Court, and so return'd to their own Lodgings.</P>
<P>No sooner was the Ambassador come home, but <HI>Genko</HI> the Interpreter<NOTE PLACE="marg">Interpreter <HI>Genko</HI>'s in|formation.</NOTE> inform'd him, That he was Commanded to tell the Ambassador, that four days hence, (being the twentieth of ours, and the six and twentieth of their Moon) there would be a second Feast, and two days after, the last, or third: Moreover, that two or three days after that, he should depart, which being ob|serv'd by the Ambassador in his Councel; and also, that it might be design'd, that just at their departure, the Emperor's Answer on their Requests might be<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ambassador and his Council consult about it.</NOTE> made known to them; after which time there would be no opportunity to alter any thing that might not agree with their Instructions; therefore they thought fit to entreat, that the Merchandize which would come in those Ships that should fetch the Ambassador, might be sold at their arrival: Whereupon they wrote the following Letter to the Assembly of the <HI>Lipous.</HI></P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe Ambassador hopes, that the <HI>Lipous</HI> have well understood his Letter of Requests,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ambassadors Re|quest to the <HI>Lipous.</HI></NOTE> and hopes for a good Answer from the Emperor: Now his further Desire is, that he may receive the Commands, and Answer of the Emperor, ten days before he goes away, that he may the better (having time to consider) understand his Imperial Majesties Will and Pleasure, and may faithfully render an account thereof to the General in <HI>Batavia;</HI> and that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> may for the future, Obey, and faithfully perform the Emperor's Com|mands, as well in the <HI>Chinkon,</HI> as ought else.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Putmans</HI> went with this Letter to the <HI>Lipous</HI> Assembly, and were directed to use such perswasive arguments, as they should think fit, to make them understand the Ambassador's Request; to which purpose, the <HI>Mandarins</HI> of the Guard were desir'd by <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> to go for him to the Assembly of the <HI>Lipous,</HI> and desire of them, that <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Putmans</HI> might be admitted into their Presence; which they promising to do, related at their return, that the <HI>Lipous</HI> had told them, that the Ambassador on the twenty sixth of their Moon (which was the sixth of <HI>Iuly</HI>) when he should be Entertain'd at the Emperor's second Banquet, might then acquaint them with what he had to Request.</P>
<P>The fourteenth, nothing happen'd of Note.</P>
<P>The fifteenth in the Forenoon, the <HI>Lipou Songlavja</HI> came with two <HI>Mandarins</HI> to the Ambassador's Lodging, to ask him what his Requests were about, which he desir'd to speak with the Council; Whereupon <HI>Van Hoorn</HI> gave him the Letter written two days before, but he was afraid to take it, until the <HI>Chinese</HI> Se|cretary <HI>Soukjen</HI> had explain'd it to him: The Ambassador ordering him to read
<PB N="336" REF="209">
it, which being done, he answer'd, The Ambassador is come hither with a Let|ter to the Emperor, therefore his Majesty will not let him go away without another, and as soon as the Emperor had resolv'd on his Business, he should not fail to have his answer in Writing deliver'd him with the Emperor's Letter to the General; To which the Ambassador reply'd, That is all I desire, and therefore ask'd the <HI>Lipous,</HI> if he might to Morrow shew the <HI>Tatan</HI> the fore-men|tion'd Letter, or not? Whereto <HI>Songlavja</HI> reply'd, That he might, if he pleas'd, but it was all one, since he knew the Contents of it; and that he would speak with him further about it to Morrow, at the Emperor's second Feast.</P>
<P>Mean while, six grand <HI>Mandarins</HI> more came to the Ambassadors House, at which the <HI>Lipou Songlavja</HI> taking his leave, advis'd the Ambassador to entertain the six <HI>Lavjas,</HI> which he perform'd, by keeping them to Dinner, and delighting their Ears with his Musick; after which they departed well satisfi'd.</P>
<P>The next Morning early, being the sixteenth, the <HI>Lipous Mandarins</HI> came to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Emperor's second Feast.</NOTE> give notice to the Ambassador, to make himself ready to go to the Emperor's second Feast: Which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> immediately perform'd, and were again conducted thither, and entertain'd after the same manner, as on the twelfth instant, without any alteration, only they did not Kneel before the <HI>Tatan:</HI> Who by the Interpreter <HI>Genko</HI> told the Ambassador, that he need not deliver the Letter of Requests which he had brought with him, because he had understood the Contents of the same from the <HI>Lipou Songlavja,</HI> which made him keep it; and taking his leave, went away, without asking or speaking any thing else, with all his Retinue: Where he was no sooner come, but the <HI>Mandarin</HI> which in the Morning had fetch'd him to the Court, came and told the Ambassador, That he and his Retinue must make themselves ready, that they might go to Morrow Morning before Day-light, to the Emperors Palace, to receive his Imperial Majesty's Presents; which the Ambassador promis'd to do. This <HI>Mandarin</HI> said also, That his Excellency should on the thirtieth of their Moon (being the tenth of our <HI>Iuly</HI>) come to the third Imperial Feast, and three days after that go away, which made the Ambassador long for the Emperor's reso|lution on his Request.</P>
<P>The seventeenth in the Morning, two hours before Day, he was fetch'd with his Retinue to the Court, to receive the Imperial Presents, and conduct them through three Gates into the Emperor's Court, on a Plain, before the fourth Gate, which faces the Throne; where, on <HI>Iune</HI> the 23. they had seen the <HI>Coreans</HI> shew Reverence to the Emperor, and their Presents lie on a Table. Here the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> rested till Day-light; about an hour after they saw some <HI>Lipous</HI> drest after a stately manner coming into the Court; and soon after, a Table was brought in, cover'd with a Piece of Red Cloth, which was set in the same place where the <HI>Corean</HI> Ambassadors stood; only this stood before the Gate at the <HI>Tartars</HI> upper Hand; when as that of the <HI>Coreans</HI> stood on the left. A little while after, some Stuffs and Money was laid upon it, which done, the Ambassador, his Son, <HI>Nobel, Putmans,</HI> and the Secretary, were call'd and plac'd just before the midle Gate, which was opposite to the Throne; yet they could not there discern the least glimps of it; for that the fifth Gate stands so high, that although it be open, yet they can see nothing belonging to the Throne.</P>
<P>After they had fac'd the Throne, and upon the Order of a Herald, kneel'd thrice, and bow'd their Heads nine times; they brought the Ambassador first those Presents that were for the Lord General, which he receiv'd kneling; and
<PB N="337" REF="209">
afterwards, those which were for himself: This done, <HI>Nobel</HI> receiv'd his like|wise; next <HI>Putmans,</HI> then the Secretary, and the rest of the Retinue, every one what was order'd for them: Which finish'd, the <HI>Mandarin</HI> Guide, <HI>Hiu</HI> and <HI>Hui|lavja,</HI> the <HI>Chinese</HI> Interpreters and Soldiers which came with them, receiv'd theirs.</P>
<P>The Presents which they receiv'd from the Emperor were as followeth:</P>
<P>For the Lord General three hundred <HI>Guilders</HI> of fine Silver, consisting in six<NOTE PLACE="marg">Presents for the Gene|ral.</NOTE> Boats, two Pieces of <HI>Chinese</HI> Cloth of Gold, two more of the same with Dra|gons, four Pieces of Flower'd Silk, with Dragons; two Pieces of Flannel, twelve Pieces of divers Colour'd Sattin, eight Pieces of Damask&punc;Silk, ten Pie|ces of rich Flower'd Stuff, ten Pieces of <HI>Pelangs,</HI> and ten Pieces of <HI>Pansjes.</HI></P>
<P>For the Ambassador an hundred <HI>Guilders</HI> of fine Silver&punc; four Pieces of <HI>Pelangs,</HI> four Pieces of <HI>Pansjes,</HI> four raw Pieces of <HI>Hokjens,</HI> three Pieces of Blue single Sattin, six Pieces of single Damask, two Pieces of Cloth of Gold, with Dragons.</P>
<P>For his Son, one Piece of black Flannel, fifteen <HI>Guilders</HI> of fine Silver, two Pieces of Raw <HI>Gazen,</HI> two Pieces of single Damask Silk.</P>
<P>For <HI>Nobel,</HI> fifty <HI>Guilders</HI> of fine Silver, one Piece of <HI>Chinese</HI> Cloth of Gold, one Piece of Flannel, three of Damask Silk, one Piece of Sattin, two of <HI>Gazen,</HI> two of <HI>Pelangs,</HI> and two of <HI>Pansjes.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Putmans</HI> and <HI>Vander Does,</HI> which had both alike, were forty <HI>Guilders</HI> of fine Silver, two Pieces of Damask Silk, one of Flannel, one of Sattin, one of <HI>Pelangs,</HI> one of <HI>Pansjes,</HI> one of single sleight Damask, and one Piece of White <HI>Goes.</HI></P>
<P>The Interpreters, <HI>Maurice Iansz Vish,</HI> and <HI>Dirk de Hase,</HI> had each two Pieces of Black Sattin, two of White <HI>Goes,</HI> two of <HI>Pansjes,</HI> two of single sleight Damask.</P>
<P>For every one of the Retinue, fifteen <HI>Guilders</HI> of fine Silver, two Pieces of raw <HI>Gazen,</HI> and two of single Damask.</P>
<P>For the Guide <HI>Mandarin Hiu Lavja,</HI> one Horse without a Saddle.</P>
<P>For the Guide <HI>Mandarin Hanlavja,</HI> and the two <HI>Chinese</HI> Interpreters, one Silk Damask Coat, Edg'd about with Gold, which they were immediately to put on, and for each of the Soldiers that came with the Ambassador, one sleight Silk Damask Coat.</P>
<P>After every one had receiv'd what was laid out for them, the Ambassador was with his Retinue led back to the place where he Kneel'd before, and did it again, as a sign of thankfulness; after which he was by the <HI>Mandarin Song-Lavja,</HI> and some other <HI>Mandarins</HI> conducted out of the Court; whereat, the Am|bassador ask'd of the <HI>Lipou Song-Lavja,</HI> when the Emperor's Letter to the Lord General, and his answer on their Requests would be deliver'd? To which he reply'd, All in good time, yet it should be three or four days before his depar|ture: Whereupon, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> return'd again to their Lodgings.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon, a young Vice-Roy, not above twenty years old, and Ne|phew to the present Emperor, came to visit the Ambassador, and to hear his Musick; which having delighted his Ears, and tasted two or three Glasses of Sack, he took his leave, seeming very well satisfi'd.</P>
<P>The nineteenth in the afternoon, another grand Lord, who had the Com|mand over the Nobility at the Court, came to the same purpose, which was accordingly granted him, and entertain'd with a Banquet; which ended, he departed.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="210">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The fourth instant, the <HI>Tatan</HI> told the Ambassador and <HI>Nobel</HI> expresly, that none there might receive any Presents, and those who told him otherwise did very ill: Wherefore the Ambassador seeing them to be in earnest, sent a Letter to the <HI>Lipous</HI> and <HI>Zoutaisins,</HI> to desire, that those Goods which he had brought with him to give away, since they would not accept of them, he might have leave to sell them; but he could get no answer upon it.</P>
<P>The twentieth, the Ambassador was fetch'd to the third Feast of the Empe|ror, and again, as before, conducted to the third <HI>Tatans</HI> Court, where he was entertain'd after the same manner, as on the sixteenth.</P>
<P>The Ambassador, after all this trouble and Expence, both of time and other|wise, gain'd no more, but to be at last dismiss'd, with a Seal'd Letter from the Emperor, to the Lord <HI>Maetzuiker</HI> in <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>So on the fifth of <HI>August,</HI> he set forth from the Imperial City <HI>Peking,</HI> to mea|sure back his former tedious Journey; and first reach'd a Temple about a League from the Town of <HI>Tonsjouw,</HI> and two from <HI>Peking,</HI> where they lay all that Night.</P>
<P>AS to what concerns the Metropolis <HI>Peking,</HI> it shall be with its whole Pro|vince at large describ'd in our following Discourse of the Empire of <HI>Chi|na</HI> or <HI>Taising.</HI></P>
<P>The great Citizens, and other Prime Court-Ladies, are here, as also through all <HI>China,</HI> seldom seen to walk in the Streets, but are carry'd in close Sedans, or <HI>Palakyns,</HI> accompany'd by a great Train of Waiting-Women, and other Servants.</P>
<P>In the Houses, their Lodgings are apart from the Men, where likewise they have Wildernesses, Groves, and pleasant Gardens, where they delight themselves in Planting curious Flowers, and keeping all manner of Singing-Birds.</P>
<P>But the high-going Madams take another manner of State upon them, espe|cially the Emperor's Concubines, who appear very rich and gorgeously Drest

in their Houses, (in manner, as are represented in the following Print, in Silk Coats, which trail on the Ground after them with very wide Sleeves; their Heads cover'd with a costly Cap, is round, and turn'd up before, cut and inden|ted like the Points of a Coronet.</P>
<P>The sixth they proceeded on their Journey from <HI>Tongsjouw,</HI> and at Noon came to the Vessels lying at the City of <HI>Siensingway,</HI> where the same Boats re|ceiv'd them that brought them thither.</P>
<P>The seventh, leaving <HI>Siensingway,</HI> and passing by many Hamlets and Villa|ges, they Anchor'd before some Houses, about a League from <HI>Giochioe.</HI></P>
<P>The ninth about Day-break, Weighing again, they arriv'd in the Forenoon at the foremention'd City, from whence, after they had gotten fresh Toers, they set Sail at Noon, and dropt Anchor that Night before the Village of <HI>Ianzin.</HI></P>
<P>The eleventh, they came to the City of <HI>Siensingway</HI> about Noon, where they waited for more Toers, because the Current was against them, and the strong|er, by reason of the Rain lately faln.</P>
<P>The next Morning, <HI>Putmans</HI> went to the <HI>Sienkin</HI> of that place, to proffer him the Presents which were laid out for him on the tenth of <HI>Iune,</HI> in their Journey up to <HI>Peking,</HI> which he had then refus'd, and put off the accepting of, till their return: From whence he sent the following Letter, with the Goods.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe Ambassador is safely arriv'd here: The Civilities which he hath receiv'd of your Lordship, shall not be forgotten: The <HI>Lipous</HI> have Commanded the Ambassador to make what speed he could possible in this his Iourney for <HI>Fokien</HI> and <HI>Batavia,</HI> there to deliver the Emperor's Letter; therefore the Emperor desires <HI>Talavja,</HI> that he would give speedy order, and dispatch.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>Putmans</HI> at his return inform'd, That the <HI>Talavja</HI> had accepted of the five Ells of Stammel&punc; and two Flasks of Rose-Water, but sent the rest back again; and as to what concern'd their speedy departure, he took no notice of, because it
<PB N="348" REF="211">
did not concern him, he having only the Command over the Soldiers.</P>
<P>Soon after, the <HI>Sionkins</HI> Interpreter came to tell the Ambassador, That his Master, in requital for the Presents, had sent him two Hogs, two Sheep, one <HI>Pikol</HI> of Rice, and some Fruit, with Request, That his Excellency would please to accept of them: Whereupon the Ambassador reply'd, That he would receive it, on condition, his Highness would also take the rest of the Presents; which the Interpreter promis'd to tell him, and at his return, acquaint the Am|bassador with his answer. Not long after, coming back, he said, That <HI>Talavja</HI> was double satisfi'd with those Presents which he had already receiv'd; yet however, to please his Excellency, he would accept of a Piece of Green Perpe|tuana, if they had it, which he gave immediate Order to lay out, but was for|gotten by the Interpreter.</P>
<P>Also the Interpreter was Presented by the Ambassador, with two Pieces of Linnen, and two Flasks of Rose-Water, because he had ask'd to buy them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Netherlanders</HI> Weighing Anchor, went with their Vessels to the South side of the City, that they might proceed on their Journey the next Morning.</P>
<P>The <HI>Toya</HI> also sent them some Presents thither, <HI>viz.</HI> Sheep, Apples, Pears, and the like, for which he return'd him the Piece of Perpetuana, which <HI>Sion|kins</HI> Interpreter had left behind him; But his Servants soon after brought it back again, saying, that their Master judg'd it too much, but if the Ambassa|dor had any Sword-blades, Pistols, or such like things, he would willingly ac|cept of them; Whereupon, the Ambassador sent him by the Interpreter <HI>Mau|rice,</HI> a Carbine, a Sword, and a handsom Knife, which he receiv'd with many Thanks.</P>
<P>After Noon, having been nobly entertain'd in one of the <HI>Sionkin</HI>'s Barques, they Weigh'd from the Suburb, and the next Morning being the fourth, set Sail from the City of <HI>Tiensingway,</HI> and in the Evening Anchor'd at <HI>Sangjue.</HI></P>
<P>The following day, in the Afternoon, they arriv'd at the City of <HI>Chinchay,</HI> where having staid about an hour and half, they set Sail again, and at Night dropt Anchor before <HI>Sincoacheen.</HI></P>
<P>The seventeenth they proceeded on their Journey, and in the Evening ar|riv'd at <HI>Chiuche.</HI></P>
<P>The eighteenth at Noon, they past by the City of <HI>Siangsjouw,</HI> without put|ting in, but in the Evening Anchor'd at the Village <HI>Talodueen.</HI></P>
<P>The nineteenth they rested at <HI>Poethouw.</HI></P>
<P>The twentieth in the Afternoon, they past by <HI>Tunquancheen,</HI> and staid all Night near <HI>Lienulhoe,</HI> where the Province of <HI>Peking,</HI> and that of <HI>Xantung</HI> is separated.</P>
<P>The one and twentieth, they Sail'd six Leagues in the Province of <HI>Xantung,</HI> and dropt Anchor at a Village call'd <HI>Lonkuntang;</HI> and next day, after Noon, staid for fresh Toers in <HI>Tuatchiouw,</HI> which having gotten, they set forward, and on the three and twentieth arriv'd at <HI>Chinjeen.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty fifth, passing by <HI>Uchincheen,</HI> they dropt Anchor that Night at <HI>Oepoeso.</HI></P>
<P>The six and twentieth, going on again, about Day-light they came in the Evening to <HI>Linsing,</HI> being got out of the River <HI>Guei,</HI> in the Royal Channel <HI>Iun;</HI> and that Evening past through the first Sluce, as in the Morning they did the second, made in <HI>Linsing,</HI> and dropt Anchor before the Custom-house, where a Chain was put cross the Channel, that no Vessels might pass without paying.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="211">The Governor of this place came in the forenoon to visit the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> in their Vessel, and bid them Welcome; who, after having been well entertain'd, took his leave.</P>
<P>After his departure, sending the Ambassador some Presents, <HI>Putmans</HI> was or|der'd to carry him a Pair of Pistols, a Sword Blade, a Piece of <HI>Perpetuana,</HI> and a Piece of Say in return.</P>
<P>The foremention'd Lord receiv'd many Letters in <HI>Putmans</HI> presence, advi|sing him, that the Emperor had Raign'd three days, and that his own <HI>Chiap</HI> or Seal was abroad.</P>
<P>The Guide <HI>Mandarins</HI> inform'd the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> that all the Governors, as well <HI>Povis, Conbons, Poutsensies</HI> or Farmers, which were up and down in the Pro|vinces were sent for, and that <HI>Tartars</HI> were to be put in their places.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon, the Governors of this place came to invite the <HI>Netherlan|ders</HI> to a Banquet, which they would willingly have refus'd; but that they being very importunate with them, were forc'd to grant their Request; so that the Ambassador told them, that so soon as the Chain was unlock'd, and his Vessels past through, he would come and wait upon them: To which they reply'd, That they would give immediate Order for it, as accordingly was done, and the Vessels permitted to pass.</P>
<P>Against the Evening, Messengers came to fetch the Ambassador to the Go|vernors: But he excusing himself, said, That he could not go out of his Barque in the Night; wherefore the Governors sent him several Dishes with prepar'd Meats to his Vessel, which was distributed amongst the Barge-men. Mean while the chief Commander of this place sent the Ambassador some Silk Stuffs, which he return'd again.</P>
<P>The twenty ninth in the Morning, they set out from the City of <HI>Linsing.</HI> In the Evening they Anchor'd at <HI>Linancotsue,</HI> which leaving on the thirtieth, they past by <HI>Tungsjaufoe,</HI> and lay that Night before <HI>Gihautchie,</HI> having past through five Water-gates that day.</P>
<P>The one and thirtieth, Weighing Anchor, they came to <HI>Xansui;</HI> and in the Evening arriv'd at <HI>Gansjan,</HI> through six Sluces, which they all found open to their great advantage.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>September</HI> they left the <HI>Gansjan,</HI> and shooting that day four Wa|ter-gates,<NOTE PLACE="marg">September.</NOTE> they dropt Anchor in the Evening at a Village call'd <HI>Kaygoeva.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning, being the second, setting Sail again, they past that Fore|noon by <HI>Namwang,</HI> and a <HI>Pagode</HI> thereto belonging, call'd <HI>Longwangmiao,</HI> where the River unites with this Channel; so that they had the Tyde with them, by which means they reach'd <HI>Sinning</HI> that Night, having past through three Sluces, when they Anchor'd before the fourth and last in the Western Suburb of the City <HI>Sinning,</HI> expecting when it should be open'd, that they might get through that also, which being not before the Afternoon, they went only a Canon shot from thence, and lay still for that Night.</P>
<P>In the Morning, the <HI>Toya</HI> of the City coming to Visit and Welcome the Ambassador, Presented him with some fresh Provisions, which he accept|ing, sent <HI>Putmans</HI> after him with five Ells of Stammel, in Requital of his Favor.</P>
<P>The fourth in the Morning, leaving <HI>Sinning,</HI> and having a fair Gale of Wind, they got to a Village call'd <HI>Naogang</HI> that afternoon, where they waited for fresh Toers, having that day shot seven Sluces or Flood-Gates.</P>
<P><PB N="342" REF="212">The fifth, setting Sail again, they arriv'd in the Evening at <HI>Iaxinho,</HI> passing through seven Water-gates that day.</P>
<P>The next day they lay still, wanting Toers.</P>
<P>The seventh in the Morning, leaving <HI>Iaxinho,</HI> they Anchor'd towards Even|ing at the Village <HI>Miliancho,</HI> where the Province of <HI>Xantung</HI> is separated from that of <HI>Nanking.</HI></P>
<P>The eighth they enter'd the Province of <HI>Nanking,</HI> and lay the next Night before <HI>Kiakia;</HI> which leaving on the ninth, they arriv'd that Morning with a fair Wind at <HI>Maulovao,</HI> three Leagues and three quarters from <HI>Kiakia,</HI> where they chang'd their Toers, which came not till the Evening, because they were fetch'd from <HI>Singsing</HI> a League and a half distant from thence.</P>
<P>The tenth in the Afternoon, setting Sail again, they arriv'd in the Even|ing before the Mouth of the Lake <HI>Usantjouw,</HI> into which the <HI>Yellow River</HI> disembogues.</P>
<P>The Bank in this place being broken, they had made a Dam in the River <HI>Geu,</HI> which takes its Original in a Village a League and a half from thence; here the Ambassador dropt Anchor, to stay for some of his Barques to come up with him, which were a good way behind. Towards Night they arriv'd at a little Village, opposite to the City <HI>Taujenjeen,</HI> which leaving again in the Morning, they reach'd the Village <HI>Namemiao</HI> at Noon, and withal got out of the <HI>Yellow River,</HI> which has so swift a Current as creates much danger.</P>
<P>The thirteenth, putting forward again, they came to the great Village <HI>Sin|kianpoe</HI> at Noon, where the <HI>Conbon</HI> of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> according to the Information of the Guide <HI>Mandarins,</HI> arriv'd the same day, being on his own Request rid of his Office to come thither.</P>
<P>The Ambassador writing a Complemental Letter to him, he sent to invite his Excellency to come to him; Whereupon, he immediately going thither, was kindly receiv'd and entertain'd by his Highness; who told the Ambassa|dor, that it was a great Honor, that the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> had been with and seen the Emperor, and that he had left some Presents in his Factors hands in <HI>Hok|sieu</HI> for to be deliver'd to the Ambassador, for the Lord General and himself, which the Ambassador would find there at his coming: The <HI>Conbon</HI> also com|mended himself for the good inclination which he had bore to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in the time of his Governorship: To which the Ambassador answer'd, That he was very sensible of it, and that they should ever be oblig'd to his Highness for it. Lastly, The <HI>Conbon</HI> said, that he was desirous to make one small Pre|sent more to the Ambassador, being only four Hogs, some Geese, and other Poultrey, which he desir'd his Excellency would be pleas'd to accept; whereon the Ambassador promis'd he would, provided his Highness would again receive the like Present from him: Which last the Interpreters durst not tell the <HI>Conbon,</HI> because several other Lords stood about him, so that there was no mention made of it.</P>
<P>So after a handsom Entertainment, the Ambassador took his leave.</P>
<P>The fourteenth in the Morning, the Ambassador in Requital of his Friend|ly Reception the day before, sent a Letter to the <HI>Conbon,</HI> and judg'd it conve|nient, since he might do much by his Recommendation in <HI>Peking,</HI> to the bene|fit of the Company, to present him with ten Ells of Stammel, ten of black Cloth, ten of Blue, one Piece of Saye, one of Crown-Serge, four Pieces of Lin|nen, two of <HI>Guinny</HI> Linnen, one fine Carpet, one String of Blood Coral, and two pair of Spectacles; and the Ambassador to oblige his Interpreter, and that
<PB N="343" REF="212">
he might put his Master in mind of the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> gave him five Ells of Stam|mel, one Sword-blade, and a pair of Spectacles.</P>
<P>This done, leaving the great Village <HI>Sinkianpoe,</HI> they past by the <HI>Conbon</HI>'s Barques, which consisted of fifty six great and small.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon they came to the North-Suburb of <HI>Haoigan,</HI> where they lay still before a Bridge, till the Townsmen had furnish'd them with Provisions.</P>
<P>The sixteenth, against Noon, the Ambassador was presented with some Pieces of Stuffs, by the <HI>Toya</HI> of that place, who was Brother to the new Gene|ral at <HI>Hoksieu;</HI> which the Ambassador judg'd not convenient to accept, but sent them back again, and with them five Ells of Stammel, partly, because he might assist the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and do much for them by writing a Letter in their behalf to his Brother; and secondly, that they might be speedily dispatch'd from thence; which prevail'd so much, that the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> left the City <HI>Ha&ograve;igan</HI> in the afternoon, and arriv'd in the Evening at <HI>Paoing.</HI> The next Morning, going from thence again, at Noon they met with a Factor belonging to the General, call'd <HI>Tziang Povi Thesia,</HI> who according to his Relation, came from <HI>Hoksieu</HI> the fifth of <HI>August,</HI> and was going for <HI>Peking;</HI> who inform'd the Am|bassador, that three Ships were arriv'd from <HI>Batavia</HI> at <HI>Sothia,</HI> and that four more were gone to <HI>Tamfui</HI> and <HI>Quelang:</HI> Moreover, that all things were well with the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> only none might go to the new arriv'd Ships, nor any come ashore out of them, neither was any Provision permitted to be sent to them.</P>
<P>The Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> and General were coming to <HI>Peking,</HI> being sent for, because they let the <HI>Netherlands</HI> Ships go away, and that the new General which was to Depose his Master met him near <HI>Lancquy:</HI> The Ambassador ask|ing him if he had brought any Letters from <HI>Harthouwer,</HI> he answer'd, No: but that fourteen days before he came from thence, two Letters were writ to the Ambassador by <HI>Harthouwer,</HI> and sent with that which the General dispatch'd to <HI>Peking,</HI> about the arrival of the foremention'd Ships: After his departure, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> putting forward, they arriv'd in the Evening at the City of <HI>Kayo|ven,</HI> where they staid all Night.</P>
<P>The next Morning, being the eighteenth, they left the City, and with Sail|ing and Toing, reach'd the City of <HI>Ianchefoe</HI> about Noon, where they lay be|fore a Custom-house.</P>
<P>The following day, the Ambassador judg'd it convenient to procure a spee|dy dispatch, by Presenting the <HI>Toya</HI> of that place with five Ells of Stammel, one Piece of <HI>Perpetuana,</HI> two <HI>Adathys,</HI> and a Book Looking-glass; with these he sent a Complementing Letter by <HI>Putmans,</HI> yet he accepted of nothing but the two <HI>Adathys,</HI> and the Looking-glasses; in return of which, he sent one Hog, one <HI>Pikol</HI> of Meal and Rice, and a parcel of Fruit; of which the Ambassador accepted only the Fruit, and sent back the rest; yet the civility of their offer avail'd so much, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were permitted to pass by the Custom|house, and in the Afternoon Sailing by the City <HI>Ianchefoe,</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Quasui.</HI></P>
<P>The twentieth in the Morning, Weighing again, they cross'd the River <HI>Ki|ang,</HI> and at Noon arriv'd at <HI>Singkiangfoe,</HI> where he sent his Secretary to the <HI>Sion|kin,</HI> Brother to one of the <HI>Lipous</HI> in <HI>Peking,</HI> to Request his Highness, that he might be dispatch'd from thence with all speed: For which Courtesie, all that he had should be at his Command and Service: To which his High|ness (according to the Secretaries Relation at his return) answer'd, The Ambassador not needing to exchange his Barques there, might go when he

pleas'd. Soon after the Secretaries return in the Barque, came his Highness Interpreter to give the Ambassador a Cup of Bean-broth in his Master's Name; for which he, by the Interpreter <HI>Maurice,</HI> Presented him with a pair of Pi|stols, which he accepted with many Thanks; his Men also had a quarter of a Piece of <HI>Perpetuana.</HI></P>
<P>A Captain who had the Command over a thousand Men in this City, and had Presented the Ambassador with some Provision, came to bid him Wel|come; for which Civility he receiv'd five Ells of Stammel.</P>
<P>The one and twentieth, in the Morning, leaving the City of <HI>Sinksianfoe,</HI> they Sail'd along the outside of it, where they saw abundance of Jonks and <HI>Cojas,</HI> (as at <HI>Ianchufoe</HI>) which were newly repair'd; of which, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> ask|ing the reason, receiv'd answer, that it was customary for all Towns to repair their Vessels once in three years.</P>
<P>In the Evening they arriv'd at <HI>Tayanchcheen,</HI> where casting Anchor for that Night, they Weigh'd again the next Morning, being the two and twentieth: Upon the way, the Ambassador was inform'd by some Barge-men that came from <HI>Suchu,</HI> that the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> was arriv'd there with his Train to go from thence up to <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>In the Afternoon they reach'd the City of <HI>Yanghsu,</HI> and the next day An|chor'd at the City of <HI>Uchinopeen,</HI> and on the twenty fourth at <HI>Xuciquan,</HI> a Vil|lage two Leagues from <HI>Suchu,</HI> before a Custom-house, where they lay all Night.</P>
<P>The next Morning passing the <HI>Boome,</HI> they arriv'd in the Afternoon at the City of <HI>Suchu,</HI> where two <HI>Blacks</HI> belonging to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong's</HI> two Sons, came aboard the Ambassador, to tell him, that their Masters were a Month since gone by Land to <HI>Peking,</HI> and that they follow'd with their Goods; adding moreover, that <HI>Singlamong</HI> was yet in <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> and was to remain there, so that the Barge-mens relation prov'd false. In the Afternoon about three a Clock, they arriv'd at the West-gate of the City of <HI>Suchu.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="345" REF="213">Here the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were met by two Conjurers, one a Man, and the other a Woman, both in handsom Apparel, of which there are great numbers in all parts of <HI>China,</HI> that for a small reward, proffer their Service to foretel all future Events, and procure a good Wind; they also came to the <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> to put their Art in practice, to hasten or shorten their Journey; but they not appro|ving of such Magical assistance, sent them away with a small Gift.</P>
<P>This Conjuring is at large describ'd in the following Description of the Em|pire of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>The Governor of this place came to visit the Ambassador, and Present him and the chiefest of his Retinue, as <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Putmans,</HI> with a well-tasted Li|quor, for which he receiv'd some Ells of Stammel.</P>
<P>Divers sorts of Liquors made of Rice, are drank by the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P>In the fifth&punc; Territory, <HI>Fuencheufu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> is a very pleasant Drink, and not inferior to either <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Rennish Wine,</HI> being made of Rice and Kids flesh, which last being bruis'd, is laid to soke in the Juyce of the Rice. This Liquor is highly esteem'd by the <HI>Chineses,</HI> being strong of operation, and of a sweet and pleasing taste to the Palate.</P>
<P>In the fifth County <HI>Hinhoa,</HI> of the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> they boyl the best Li|quor in all <HI>China,</HI> of Rice and Water.</P>
<P>The six and twentieth in the Morning, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> left the great City <HI>Suchu</HI> with a fair Wind, and came that Evening to the South Suburb of <HI>Ukia|jeen,</HI> which City is neatly built, and though not very big, yet it is surrounded with strong&punc; Walls. The Inhabitants thereof maintain themselves with Mer|chandizing and Husbandry.</P>
<P>In the Morning setting Sail from thence, and having got about three Leagues and a half farther, they were forc'd, the Evening coming suddenly up|on them, to make to their Harbor.</P>
<P>The twenty eighth in the Morning, they set Sail again from thence, and in the Afternoon past by <HI>Kiangfoe,</HI> where they went out of the Province of <HI>Nan|king,</HI> into that of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> and in the Evening arriv'd at a Village call'd <HI>Sinning.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty ninth, Weighing again, they had in sight the City of <HI>Ukiajeen,</HI> which having past, in the Evening they rested at <HI>Tangheg.</HI></P>
<P>The thirtieth they came to the North-Suburb of <HI>Hanksieu,</HI> before a Custom|house, where the Channel being shut up by a Gate under a Bridge, the Am|bassador sent to desire that it might be open'd, and the Barques suffer'd to go through; but the Watch-men answer'd, That they must first have order from the <HI>Poutsjensy,</HI> or the Emperor's Farmer; so that the Secretary <HI>Vander Does</HI> was sent to the Governor and <HI>Conbon</HI> at <HI>Hanksieu</HI> with a Letter, in which the Ambas|sador desir'd to be speedily dispatch'd, and if their Highnesses pleas'd, he would come to Complement them. Moreover, the Secretary was Commanded to ask them, If their Highnesses would permit the Ambassador to come and speak with them, and bring those Presents, of which their Highnesses had receiv'd the Inventory at their Journey up to <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>In the Morning, the first of <HI>October,</HI> the Gate being open'd, the Ambassador went through with his whole Retinue: Soon after, the Secretary coming aboard again, related, That he had been at the Generals the last Night, but could not be admitted to Audience. To the Letter which he sent him by his Clerk, he had return'd answer, That he would send a <HI>Mandarin</HI> early the next Morning, to let the Ambassador through the Gate, and withal, conduct him
<PB N="346" REF="214">
to his House; but it being too late for the Secretary to go to the <HI>Conbon</HI> that Night, he went thither the next Morning, to deliver his Highness the Ambas|sador's Letter, and met him as he was coming out of his Court-gate, (to Com|plement a great Lord, which the day before came thither from <HI>Hoksieu</HI>) and re|ceiv'd in answer, that his Highness humbly thank'd the Ambassador for his Ci|vility, and that he would expect him.</P>
<P>Mean while, the Vessels went so far into the Suburb, that they came to An|chor against a Bank.</P>
<P>The second, the <HI>Toya</HI> of that place came to Welcom the Ambassador in his Vessel.</P>
<P>The third, nothing happen'd of remark.</P>
<P>The fourth, all the Goods were taken out of these, and put into six other Barques, lying on the other side of the Bank; with which <HI>Putmans</HI> and <HI>Vander Does</HI> went the next Morning to the other side of the City, there to Reimbarque; the Ambassador, <HI>Nobel,</HI> and some of the Retinue going before by Land, to give order for Shipping of the Goods.</P>
<P>On the seventh in the Morning, leaving the South-Suburb of <HI>Hanksieu,</HI> they arriv'd in the Afternoon at <HI>Foejenjeen;</HI> the ninth at <HI>Nienchefoe;</HI> and the tenth at <HI>Lanqui,</HI> where the great Barques were chang'd for small; because here the Ri|ver began to be very shallow.</P>
<P>The Governor of this Village invited them to Dinner, which in regard they could not put off, they went thither, and were very kindly enter|tain'd, with various Meats, Musick, and Drolls, towards Evening ta|king leave.</P>
<P>On the twelfth in the Morning, they left <HI>Lanqui;</HI> and on the thirteenth came to the City of <HI>Longuen;</HI> as on the fourteenth, to <HI>Kietsieu.</HI></P>
<P>The sixteenth in the Evening, the Ambassador came with his Vessel to <HI>Sin|hoe;</HI> but the rest staid behind, not able to follow for the shallowness of the Wa|ter, and strong contrary Tyde; yet on the seventeenth in the Morning, they ar|riv'd there in safety.</P>
<P>The Ambassador and his Retinue were also lodg'd in the same House, where|in they lay at their Journey going up.</P>
<P>Here all things were prepar'd to travel over the Mountains, when the Am|bassador finding that there wanted three hundred and fifty <HI>Coelies</HI> to carry the Goods and People, he ask'd the <HI>Mandarin</HI> Guides how many <HI>Coelies</HI> were allow'd by the Emperor's Order, for the carrying of the Goods, and prepar'd by the <HI>Pimpous?</HI> To which they reply'd, an hundred and eighty nine; and because one of the General of <HI>Hanksieu</HI>'s People had told the Ambassador at <HI>Fojenjeen,</HI> that he should find so many Porters ready to carry the Goods over the Mountains, he sent the Secretary on the eighteenth in the Morning to <HI>Tjangtjen,</HI> a League and a half from thence, to enquire of the <HI>Mandarin,</HI> who had the Command of that Village, and there Resident, what Orders he had from the General of <HI>Hanksieu?</HI> Whereupon he declar'd, That he had no other Order concerning any <HI>Coelies,</HI> than what he had from the <HI>Pimpous;</HI> so that the Ambassador gave immediate Order for the hiring of an hundred and fifty <HI>Coelies,</HI> with which he went on the next day; and on the two and twentieth came to <HI>Poutchinfoe</HI> in the Province of <HI>Fokieu;</HI> and on the three and twentieth, <HI>Nobel, Putmans,</HI> and <HI>Vander Does,</HI> return'd Thanks to the Almighty, for helping them safe over the steep Mountains.</P>
<P><PB N="347" REF="214">The twenty fifth, having Shipt their Goods, and Imbarqu'd themselves, they set Sail with the Tyde, from the City of <HI>Poutchinfoe,</HI> and rested before a Watch-House at the Village <HI>Siphea.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty sixth, going forward, they came, having Sail'd two Leagues, to a Rocky place, where the River was very shallow; by the strong Current, one of the Ambassadors and one of the <HI>Mandarin Hiulavja</HI>'s Barques were beaten a|gainst a Rock, whereby they grew very Leaky. This Night they also lay still before a Village, wherein was also a Watch-house.</P>
<P>The twenty eighth, they dropt Anchor again before another Watch-house, and on the twenty ninth arriv'd at the City of <HI>Kienningfoe,</HI> where staying till the next day, they set Sail again on the thirtieth, and arriv'd on the last at <HI>Ien|pingfoe,</HI> which since their departure from thence in <HI>March,</HI> was above a third part consum'd by fire.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>November,</HI> the Ambassador and his Retinue proceeding on their<NOTE PLACE="marg">November.</NOTE> Journey, were unexpectedly in the Afternoon about twenty <HI>Lys</HI> from a Vil|lage call'd <HI>Sukauw,</HI> met by the Merchant <HI>David Harthouwer,</HI> and some other from <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> informing him of the condition of their Affairs. Towards Even|ing they came to <HI>Sukauw,</HI> where they lay all Night&punc;</P>
<P>On the second before Day-light, going from thence, they came in the After|noon to <HI>Lamthay,</HI> the Suburb of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> after a Journey of nine Months, and twelve days.</P>
<P>Going all together to their old Inn, they found there the <HI>Toucy Liulavja,</HI> who told and shew'd them a written Order from the General, That all those Goods which they had brought with them must be search'd: Whereupon the Ambas|sador answer'd, That this manner seem'd very strange to him, and that he had never heard of any that search'd an Ambassadors Goods; nay, that it was not done in <HI>Peking,</HI> nor any place else in all their Journey: But if the General would have it so, he might follow his Order, and begin with the Ambassador's Chest first.</P>
<P>This Answer somewhat chang'd his Intentions, granting moreover, That the Ambassador's, and other Persons of Quality's Chests, should not be search'd, but those of the Retinue, and in which the Presents were, could not pass with|out; whereupon, they being all brought in and open'd, all things that were in them were set down; in which <HI>Toucy Liulavja</HI> spent all the Afternoon.</P>
<P>The fourth in the Morning, one <HI>Lapora</HI> and the <HI>Mandarin</HI> of the Inn came to tell the Ambassador, That the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> had sent for his Excellency to the Court, to bid him Welcome; wherupon they all went thi|ther, and were kindly receiv'd by his Highness. After many Complements past on both sides, the Vice-Roy ask'd the Ambassador, If he had not told them the truth of all their Adventures before they went to <HI>Peking?</HI> They would not be|lieve him then, but now having been in <HI>Peking,</HI> themselves might judge that he was a Man of Truth: To which the Ambassador answer'd, That his Majesties real Intentions had sufficiently appear'd, and the Lord <HI>Maetzuiker</HI> in <HI>Batavia,</HI> would without doubt be thankful to him for his Favors: They were also sen|sible, that the King's Envoy in <HI>Peking</HI> had been a great instrument, and help'd much in their receiving of great Honors from the Emperor, <HI>Taisins, Kings, Li|pous,</HI> and other grand Lords: Moreover, he hop'd that from this Embassy there would follow more Friendship, to the profit of both Nations, than had hitherto been: Whereupon <HI>Singlamong</HI> reply'd, That those were only outward businesses, but he had done so much for the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> that it cost him two
<PB N="348" REF="215">
thousand <HI>Tail,</HI> and the General his Place. To which the Ambassador answer'd, As to what concern'd himself, he would do all that lay in his power to serve the Vice-Roy, but as for the two thousand <HI>Tail</HI> or the General, he knew nothing of it; but he was heartily sorry that no better News was come from above. The Vice-Roy reply'd, That he had onely told it cursorily to the Ambassador, and that they should henceforth speak no more of it. Soon after the Tables being furnish'd with Meat, and the Ambassador having eaten a little took his leave, the Vice-Roy advising him to go and visit the General. Coming into the Vice-Roy's base Court, a <HI>Mandarin</HI> that was to conduct him to the General told him, that if his Highness were not at leisure to speak with him, that then he might return to his Lodgings; so that the Ambassador staying in the Vice-Roy's Court, sent the Secretary <HI>Vander Does,</HI> with the Interpreter <HI>de Hase,</HI> to enquire if the General were at leisure to grant the Ambassador Audience: Not long after returning, he said that the General had sent Answer, That it was not customary to make an Address to him the same day that they had been at the Vice-Roy's, therefore his Excellency would do well to come the next Morning, and then he would grant him a Hearing. Whereupon the <HI>Netherlan|ders</HI> going to their Lodging, found the <HI>Mandarin Liulavja</HI> with express Order from the General, That the rest of the Chests that were not search'd must be open'd, which the Ambassador suffer'd to be done without any contradiction.</P>
<P>At Night it was judg'd convenient for divers reasons, that their intended Visit to the General the following Day, should onely be Complemental, with|out speaking a word of any Business; but to tell him, that what the Ambas|sador had to impart to his Highness should hereafter be done in Writing.</P>
<P>The fifth in the Morning they went to the General, who after some stay per|mitted them to come into his Presence; where the Ambassador was plac'd on his left Hand (but the upper among the <HI>Tartars</HI>) on a Stool a little distance from his, and <HI>Nobel, Harthouwer,</HI> and others on his right Hand, on Stools and Benches. Being thus seated, the Ambassador (the General being silent) said, That he was very joyful to see <HI>Talavja</HI> in good health, and that he was permit|ted into his Presence. To which he reply'd, That it was but his Duty to grant Audience to all Strangers. Then the Ambassador proceeding said, That the Embassy was now finish'd, and that he had the Emperor's and <HI>Lipous</HI> Let|ters by him, which being Seal'd must be deliver'd to the Lord <HI>Maetzuiker;</HI> so that now, since <HI>Talavja</HI>'s Word was as much there as the Emperor's, they would seek in all things possible to obey him. To which the General ma|king no Reply, after a little silence, ask'd for the Ambassador's Son: to whom the Interpreter said, That if the Ambassador had any thing to re|quest of his Highness, he should acquaint him with it now. Whereupon he desir'd that the Merchants might fetch in their Debts, and balance their Accounts; and that the rest of the Goods of the last Year, and those which they had brought back with them from <HI>Peking,</HI> might be sold, that he might prepare himself for his Return to <HI>Batavia.</HI> To which the General said, He knew very well that the Debts must be paid; but he had receiv'd a Letter from the Emperor, in which the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were forbid to sell their Goods. Whereupon the Ambassador reply'd, That in <HI>Peking</HI> it was meant the new-come Goods, but his Desire was onely that the last years Trade which was granted by the Emperor, might be finish'd. Moreover, that they might lay out the Silver which they had brought from <HI>Peking,</HI> that by that means it might remain in the Countrey, which else would be carry'd away. The Ge|neral
<PB N="349" REF="215">
answer'd again, That he must observe the Emperor's Orders, as the Ambassador the Lord <HI>Maetzuikers,</HI> and that they might not sell prohibited Goods; not but that he judg'd it better for the Silver to stay in the Land, than to be carry'd out from thence. Lastly, the Ambassador desir'd that he might onely send some Provisions to the Ships; which the General granted, giving him a Note of them. Then the Ambassador saying he durst not detain <HI>Ta|lavja</HI> any longer, desir'd to take his leave: The General reply'd, That he was glad to hear such civil Expressions from him; and so they parted.</P>
<P>The Ambassador coming to his Lodgings, judg'd it convenient, since he was permitted to send some Provisions to the Ships, to take hold of the opportuni|ty, and to send the <HI>Hilversan</HI> Flyboat with all the Papers and Answers to <HI>Bata|via,</HI> with a Letter to advise the Council there of their success. Likewise, that he might oblige the <HI>Conbon</HI> and General to be assisting in their Business, he thought good to present the General with half a Piece of Purple Cloth, one String of Blood Coral, six Pieces of Linnen, two of Says, two of Amber, two of Cloth-Serge, one Gun with a Stock of Palm-Wood, two Swords, a pair of Pistols, one Sword-Blade, ten Flasks of Rose-Water, and one Piece of black Cloth. To the <HI>Conbon</HI> they intended one Piece of red Cloth, six Pieces of Linnen, two of Says, two of great Amber, two of Cloth-Serge, one String of Blood Coral, one Gun, two Swords, one Piece of Perpetuana, ten Flasks of Rose-Water.</P>
<P>The same day <HI>Nobel,</HI> according to their Resolution, went to the Factor <HI>La|pora,</HI> to enquire if any Silks could be bought for Silver or Merchandise; but <HI>Lapora</HI> telling him the difficulty of it, they attempted no farther.</P>
<P>The sixth in the Morning the Ambassador and the chiefest of his Retinue went to the <HI>Conbon</HI>'s Court to Complement his Highness; before whom being brought, having waited a considerable time, several Complements pass'd as at the Generals, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Ambassador was glad to see <HI>Talavja</HI> in health, and that he had the favor to appear in his Presence; adding, That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had receiv'd many Civilities from the late <HI>Conbon,</HI> and hop'd that they should also participate of his Highness's Favors. Whereupon the <HI>Conbon</HI> ask'd if the Ambassador enjoy'd his Health in his Journey to and from <HI>Peking?</HI> whereto he answer'd <HI>Yes;</HI> and that he had receiv'd great Honor there, and was come away in Friendship, desiring nothing more, than to leave <HI>Hoksieu</HI> also in Love and Amity, for which he desir'd his Highness's assistance. The <HI>Conbon</HI> replying said, That the Ambassador had brought the <HI>Chinkon</HI> to <HI>Peking,</HI> wherein the Em|peror had taken great pleasure, why then should not he be kind to him? he did not meet him by the Way, therefore he would now send him some Provisions for a Present. Soon after the <HI>Conbon</HI> ask'd the Ambassador when he intended to go from thence? To which he answer'd, When the General and <HI>Conbon</HI> pleas'd; and that he never doubted but the Goods of last Year might have been sold with freedom, and they might also lay out their Silver for Commodities; but since he understood that it could not be permitted, he therefore desir'd to avoid all trouble, that he might be gone so soon as it was possible, and would rather suffer damage, than do contrary to the Emperor's Order. Here|upon the <HI>Conbon</HI> said, that he was not well inform'd therein; and withall ask'd the Ambassador if he would immediately be gone, or stay a little longer? To which the Ambassador reply'd, That so soon as the Merchants had receiv'd their Debts, and all things balanc'd, then he would be gone, the sooner the better. After which no other Discourse passing, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> took their leave.</P>
<P><PB N="350" REF="216">Mean while <HI>Putmans</HI> went to the Generals Court with an Inventory of the Presents which the Ambassador had design'd for him the Day before, to shew it to his Highness, but was forc'd to return without Audience, being order'd to come again the following Day: wherefore the Ambassador sent <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Putmans</HI> again on the seventh, and also to proffer the <HI>Conbon</HI> his Presents, but they had as ill success as <HI>Putmans</HI> the Day before, for they could not be permit|ted to Audience.</P>
<P>After the Interpreter had taken the Inventory of the Generals Presents from them, and shew'd it to his Highness, he brought Answer, That the General would accept no Presents.</P>
<P>Towards the Evening the Interpreter <HI>Kako</HI> came to the Lodge, with Com|mands to search the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat.</P>
<P>The eighth in the Morning the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s Interpreter, and his prime Factor call'd <HI>Iongsavija,</HI> came to bring the following Presents: First, for the Lord <HI>Maetzuiker</HI> sixteen Pieces of Sattin, twenty of Sarsnet, four <HI>Brokkado's,</HI> six hundred and ten Pieces of <HI>Porcelane,</HI> one <HI>Picol</HI> of <HI>Tee.</HI></P>
<P>For the Ambassador, eight Pieces of Sattin, two <HI>Brokkado's,</HI> ten Pieces of Sarsnet, a hundred Pieces of <HI>Porcelane,</HI> and one <HI>Picol</HI> of <HI>Tee.</HI></P>
<P>For <HI>Harthouwer,</HI> six Pieces of Sarsnet, two <HI>Brokkado's,</HI> eight Pieces of Sattin, half a <HI>Picol</HI> of <HI>Tee,</HI> and a hundred <HI>Tee</HI> Cups.</P>
<P>Moreover, they said that the Vice-Roy at that time had no such fine Goods by him as he could have wish'd for, to have presented the Lord <HI>Maetzuiker</HI> and the Ambassador withall; desiring that his Excellency would not refuse these Trifles; adding also, That their Lord was very sorry the <HI>Hollanders</HI> had no better success in their Business at the Court of <HI>Peking,</HI> and that he declar'd it was not his fault; but on the contrary, had us'd his utmost endeavor to assist them for the obtaining of their Desires: but since it so fell out that the Em|peror would not grant them, they must have patience (because nothing could be done against the Emperor's Order) and hope for a better Event. To which the Ambassador answer'd, That he humbly thank'd the Vice-Roy, and since he could not refuse his Kindness, he would accept of the Stuffs: but as to their Business he knew nothing of it, because the Emperor's and <HI>Lipous</HI> Letters were deliver'd to him Seal'd, and he commanded in that manner to deliver them at <HI>Batavia;</HI> and that the Orders therein mention'd (whatever they were) should be strictly observ'd. Furthermore the Ambassador said, That he de|sir'd nothing else now, but that he might sell the Commodities which were remaining of the last Year, and afterwards go away, without being willing to request the disposal of those Commodities which were come since, because he would not stay for an Answer from the Emperor; or that they might not write to him about it. To which they reply'd, That they would acquaint the Vice-Roy with it; yet it was a Business which did not concern him, but the General and <HI>Conbon,</HI> therefore the Ambassador must request it of them. The Ambassador replying said, That there would immediately be a Letter ready for that purpose, to be carry'd to the General and <HI>Conbon.</HI> Some Complements passing on both sides, and the Ambassador giving them a Gratuity, they return'd.</P>
<P>Soon after the Ambassador sent <HI>Putmans</HI> with the following Letter to the General, which was to this effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe Ambassador hath understood by a Letter from your Highness, that three <HI>Hol|land</HI> Ships are arriv'd at <HI>Tenhay</HI> to fetch the Ambassador; and also that a
<PB N="351" REF="216">
Ship at her going by to <HI>Japan</HI> put in there for Letters from him. <HI>Talavja</HI> hath com|manded that the Ambassador should send down thither to command the going away of the three Ships. The Ambassador hath acquainted the <HI>Lipous</HI> in <HI>Peking,</HI> that three Ships were to come from <HI>Batavia</HI> to fetch him. The Ambassador knew not but that the Trade granted the last Year by the Emperor might be finish'd; wherefore he desires that he may dispose of the rest of those Goods (of which he here sends an Inventory) in such manner as was done in <HI>Peking;</HI> and that then the Ambassador would immediately go away with all his Ships and Men. The Ambassador would be very sorry if any more trouble should happen. And to manifest that the Ambassador will not onely obey and serve <HI>Talavja</HI> in words, but in deeds, he humbly desires, that if the remaining Goods may not be sold, that he may obtain leave of your Highness to go away with all his Retinue and Goods with the first opportu|nity, and that in few days after no more Ships should be seen.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>Putmans</HI> returning said, That he not onely could not be admitted to Audi|ence, but that the General would not take the Letter.</P>
<P>The ninth in the Morning the Ambassador sent a Letter by the Factor <HI>La|pora</HI> to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong,</HI> being to return him thanks for the Presents receiv'd the Day before, which was to this effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THat the Ambassador hath found sufficiently since his Return to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> his High|ness's good Inclinations. That the Honor and Friendship which the Ambassador receiv'd in <HI>Peking</HI> he believes did proceed from the Vice-Roy's Recommendation. The Am|bassador declares, that he hath endeavor'd in this <HI>Chinkon</HI> as much as possible he could, to preserve the Honor of the Realm of <HI>Holland,</HI> the General in <HI>Batavia,</HI> and also his own Reputation. The Ambassador is exceedingly rejoyc'd, that the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s Heart is really inclin'd to him, and therefore esteems his Presents, being from so great a King, very much. That the King in <HI>Batavia</HI> hath been pleas'd to present the General is his High|ness's Civility. The Ambassador is very well satisfi'd, and exceeding thankful for them; but he finds that this satisfaction is mix'd with a great desire to know how and after what manner he shall manifest his thanks; therefore wishes that he may be inform'd either by his Highness, or some Person else, if the Ambassador during his stay there, or in <HI>Batavia,</HI> or where-ever it might be, could do the King any acceptable Service, which if it be in the Ambassador's power, he will account it a great happiness, that he may manifest that he esteems more to do well, than to write or speak well.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>The thirteenth in the Morning the Secretary <HI>Vander Does, Nicholas Berkman,</HI> and the Interpreter <HI>Maurice,</HI> went with a <HI>Chinese</HI> Vessel down to <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven and <HI>Tenhay,</HI> that according to their Resolution the Night before they might dispatch the <HI>Helverzum</HI> Flyboat, and the <HI>Pimpel</HI> Pink, and likewise take a view of the Ships.</P>
<P>After their departure the <HI>Toucy</HI> came to tell the Ambassador, That the Ge|neral and <HI>Conbon</HI> would buy all the rest of the Goods, and that he should write down the lowest Prices of them on a piece of Paper, and that then their Fa|ctors should come to receive and pay for them with ready Money. The Am|bassador hereupon shew'd him to the Merchants, who were busie making an Invoyce of them, which when done was given to him.</P>
<P>The fourteenth and fifteenth nothing hapned of note.</P>
<P>The sixteenth a Servant sent from the <HI>Toucy</HI> brought a written Order (as he said) from the General, that the Store-houses must be searched, because some Counterband Goods were come with the Embassy, and the like&punc; Whereupon
<PB N="352" REF="217">
the Ambassador immediately sent the Merchant <HI>Harthouwer</HI> and Interpreter <HI>de Hase</HI> to the <HI>Toucy,</HI> with Commands to tell him,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That the <HI>Toucy</HI> would be pleas'd to pay that which he ow'd to the Com|pany, being seven hundred <HI>Tail.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That the <HI>Toucy</HI> knew very well, that the Debt which was owing from the late <HI>Talavja,</HI> or General, and others, was above four thousand <HI>Tail;</HI> also that he should seek to procure the payment thereof, and bring the Silver to the Lodge.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That the Ambassador would henceforth suffer no more Searching, except by express Order from the General.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. That if he had search'd the Ambassador's Chest by the General's Order, it was well; but if not, the Ambassador had suffer'd disgrace by it, because he had not been so serv'd in <HI>Peking,</HI> nor any other Place in <HI>China.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>At his Return <HI>Harthouwer</HI> related, That the <HI>Toucy</HI> excus'd himself to the Ambassador, alledging that it was not his fault; the last written Order was not sent to him, but to the Interpreter, to see for some Bundles of <HI>Gazen,</HI> which were not set down by his People: Moreover, that he receiv'd nothing but civility from the Ambassador; and as for the Searching, it was by the Gene|ral's Order; that he would come the next Morning to pay his Debts, and also lay out some Goods for the General and <HI>Conbon</HI> to buy; that the rest might be sold to other People; likewise that the other Debts should be brought to the Lodge.</P>
<P>The seventeenth the <HI>Toucy Liulavja</HI> came with a Note of the rest of the Pre|sents, with the Prices at which the General and <HI>Conbon</HI> would buy the Goods.</P>
<P>The Ambassador order'd <HI>Harthouwer</HI> to tell the <HI>Toucy,</HI> That he did not cre|dit him, neither would he have any thing to do with him, but would send to the General himself to know if those Prices were set down for them, and that then he should have an Answer. Whereupon the <HI>Toucy</HI> desir'd <HI>Harthouwer</HI> to come to his House the next Morning, and then he would go with him to the <HI>Conbon</HI> to ask the Question.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon the Secretary <HI>Vander Does, Nicholas Berkman,</HI> and <HI>Maurice,</HI> arriv'd from <HI>Tenhay</HI> and <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, with relation of the good condition of all things about the Ships, and that the Men long'd onely for fresh Pro|visions.</P>
<P>The twenty fourth the Ambassador commanded <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Harthouwer,</HI> that they should go to the <HI>Toucy</HI>'s House the next Morning, that according to his Request they might go together to the General and <HI>Conbon,</HI> and to ask if the Prices were for their Highnesses? and likewise to whom they would have their Presents deliver'd, that they might not be defrauded, and in the last place earnestly to desire, that they might have liberty to send fresh Provisions to the Ships, otherwise the Ambassador would desire to be gone with all the speed possible.</P>
<P>The eighteenth in the Morning <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Harthouwer</HI> went to the <HI>Toucy,</HI> and coming with him to the <HI>Conbon</HI>'s they stay'd till Noon, yet could get no Audi|ence; but the <HI>Conbon</HI> sent them word, that they should deliver the Presents, and also the rest of the Merchandise to the <HI>Toucy Liulavja,</HI> except the Strings of Blood Coral, which they must deliver to himself the next day, when he would grant them Audience.</P>
<P>Against the Evening the <HI>Toucy Liulavja</HI> coming to the Lodge to fetch the fore-mention'd Goods, said that <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Harthouwer</HI> need not come with the
<PB N="353" REF="217">
Blood Coral the next day, but that the Ambassador must in Person appear at the <HI>Conbon</HI>'s Court about six days hence, and then bring the Coral, and also an Account of those Debts that were owing, along with him, and then the <HI>Ne|therlanders</HI> would have Orders to be gone within ten days.</P>
<P>The remaining Goods with the Presents being accordingly deliver'd to him, for the most part he carry'd away that Night, and fetch'd the remainder the next Morning.</P>
<P>The nineteenth <HI>Poutsiensy, Assensy,</HI> and the General's Interpreter came to the Lodge, to ask when the Ambassador would be ready for his departure? Where|to he answer'd, That so soon as the Accounts of the owing Debts, being Audited, were paid, he would give them no farther trouble, but take Shipping immediately. Whereupon they reply'd, Would he please onely to give them a Schedule thereof, and they would take care that satisfaction should be made in three or four days. The Ambassador answer'd, That if what they promis'd were cetarin, he should be clear for his Voyage within a Week. Then the Ambassa|dor ask'd if the <HI>Hollanders</HI> might buy no manner of Goods? To which they answer'd, That he might buy course Commodities, as <HI>Porcelane</HI> and the like; but they must first acquaint the General with it; mean while the <HI>Hollanders</HI> should draw up what Provisions they wanted for their Voyage, which was im|mediately done, and deliver'd to the <HI>Mandarin Liulavja.</HI></P>
<P>The twentieth in the Morning the Ambassador sent <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Harthouwer</HI> to Court with this following Letter.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>THe Ambassador seeks in all things to obey <HI>Talavja,</HI> and give him satisfa|ction. <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Officers that provide for Strangers.</NOTE> The <HI>Poutsiensy</HI> and <HI>Assensy</HI> hav eask'd him what day he would be gone? to which he answer'd, That he could be ready on the twelfth of this Moon, and therefore desires that the Provisions for their Voyage may be brought according to the inclos'd Bill, and sent down to the Ship at <HI>Nanthay,</HI> and likewise the Silver and <HI>Porcelane.</HI> The Ambassador requests likewise that he may buy and carry the following Goods along with him, <HI>viz. China</HI> Roots, <HI>Tee,</HI> Anniseed, course <HI>Porcelane,</HI> some Stuffs, Stools, Cabinets, and other Trifles.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Harthouwer</HI> returning in the Afternoon gave account, That they could not be admitted to Audience by the General, but after the Letter being deliver'd to him by his Interpreter, he permitted the Ambassador to buy the Provisions which he desir'd, but nothing else.</P>
<P>Soon after the <HI>Toucies, Liulavja</HI> and <HI>Hayongloja</HI> came again to tell the Ambas|sador, That the General considering better on his Request, had granted that he might buy eight or ten <HI>Picol</HI> of <HI>China</HI> Root.</P>
<P>The one and twentieth nothing hapned of any note.</P>
<P>The two and twentieth the fore-mention'd <HI>Toucies</HI> came to the Lodge to tell the Ambassador, That his Retinue&punc;which came with him from <HI>Peking,</HI> must produce all those Stuffs which they had bought by the Way, because they would buy them again: This they said was the General's Order, which if they would not obey, he would search their Chests, and if he found any Stuffs in them, he would seize them as Forfeit.</P>
<P>The Ambassador hereupon calling his Attendants together, commanded them, whoever they were, excepting none (because he would not come in any trouble) to bring out all their Stuffs, and deliver them to the fore-mention'd
<PB N="354" REF="218">
<HI>Lavja's;</HI> which being accordingly done, their <HI>Mandarins</HI> taking them, put them into a Chest, and carry'd them out of the Lodge.</P>
<P>At Noon, according to the Resolution taken the Night before, <HI>Nobel</HI> went to the Vice-Roy's Court, to proffer his Highness a String of Blood Coral; which he freely and kindly accepted in the Presence of all his Attendants.</P>
<P>Mean while the <HI>Mandarin Liulavja</HI> came to the Lodge from the General and <HI>Conbon,</HI> bringing Money with him for the remaining Goods which they had bought.</P>
<P>This <HI>Mandarin</HI> also inform'd, that the <HI>Overveen</HI> Frigat, and <HI>Balfour,</HI> who had brought some Renegade <HI>Chineses</HI> from <HI>Quelang,</HI> might not go away with the Ambassador, but must stay there till they had order from the Emperor concern|ing it. Moreover, the Ambassador must go to the <HI>Conbon</HI> the next Morning, and afterwards to the <HI>Assensy,</HI> and two days hence to the General and <HI>Poutsiensy,</HI> to speak with them about the fore-mention'd, and what other Business else: which the Ambassador promis'd the next Morning to observe.</P>
<P>The next Morning, being the twenty third, the Ambassador went with <HI>No|bel, Harthouwer,</HI> and others, to the <HI>Conbon,</HI> taking with him a Note of the sold Merchandise, and also the String of Blood Coral, which on the fifth Instan they resolv'd amongst other Goods to present to his Highness, as the <HI>Toucy Liulavja</HI> had told the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> on the eighteenth. Coming to the usual Hall they found the <HI>Toucy Liulavja,</HI> who soon after was call'd to the <HI>Conbon,</HI> and at his Return told the Ambassador privately, That because there were so many People with him, his Highness had judg'd it best, that the Ambassador should deliver the Chain of Coral to him, that he might deliver it to his Highness, who was afraid to receive it in the presence of so many Persons, and for the weight thereof, and Pieces of Coral, he might place in the Note amongst the other Merchandise if he would not trust him with them, which the Ambassador also did. His Highness, as <HI>Liulavja</HI> said at his return, had re|ceiv'd the Coral with many thanks. Not long after the Ambassador was also call'd in, and seated by his Highness, who after some Complements said, That he would willingly have Entertain'd the Ambassador now, but because he had not been Treated by the General, he would stay till that was over. The Am|bassador thanking him for his Civility, desir'd, that since he intended to be gone very suddenly, and his Servants were now busie Packing up their Goods, that his Highness would please to excuse him from coming to his Feast, and that he esteem'd this Visit as much as the greatest Entertainment. To which his Highness reply'd, That he would consider of it, and if he did not invite him, he would send the Dishes prepar'd to the Lodge. Then he ask'd when he thought he should be ready to go his Voyage? who reply'd, Against the twelfth of their Moon, or the twenty sixth of ours: which pleasing his High|ness very well he said, That he could not assist the <HI>Hollanders</HI> in the Transport|ing some Silk-Stuffs, alledging that it was none of his fault, but the Emperor's Order, who had strictly forbid it. Then the Ambassador gave him the Inven|tory of the Goods that were sold, and an Account of the Moneys that were owing; likewise a Note of the Gifts ready to be presented, adding that he humbly thank'd his Highness for permitting him to sell the remaining Goods. After having look'd over the Note of the Presents, the Ambassador told his Highness, that the <HI>Mandarin Liulavja</HI> had the day before inform'd him, That the Ship come thither with the Renegade <HI>Chineses</HI> and <HI>David Balfour,</HI> might not go away with the Ambassador, but must stay in <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, and <HI>Balfour</HI>
<PB N="355" REF="218">
at <HI>Lamthay,</HI> till Order came from the Emperor about it, to whom they had written: The Ambassador therefore desir'd, since the Vessel was very old, not being fit to stay there, that she might go away with him; but if this could not be granted, he would be obedient, and press no farther, but leave her be|hind. Whereupon his Highness in excuse said they had contriv'd to dismiss all the Ships together, but the <HI>Mansjuwee</HI> would not consent till they had an An|swer from <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>The Ambassador also ask'd a second time if they would please to dismiss them all from <HI>Lamthay.</HI> Whereupon his Highness answer'd him, That the Am|bassador should not trouble himself about the Ship, for he would take care that it should be furnish'd with all Necessaries; nay, if the Emperor would not be at the Charge, he would pay it out of his own Purse; asking besides, if the Person that came with the <HI>Chineses</HI> from <HI>Quelang</HI> was at <HI>Lamthay?</HI> To which being answer'd, He was, he said that he would consult with the General if any others should stay, or all have their Pasport.</P>
<P>Then the Ambassador demanded if he might not deal for some fine <HI>Porce|lane</HI> or <HI>Tee?</HI> To which his Highness first answer'd as if he permitted it; but afterwards beginning to retract, he chang'd his Discourse, beginning to en|quire how many Men they had, that thereby they might the better accom|modate them with Provision: which said, the Ambassador took his leave, and went away.</P>
<P>Coming into the outer Court, he found the <HI>Mandarin Liulavja,</HI> whom he ask'd if he should now go to the <HI>Assensy?</HI> To which he was answer'd, No, be|cause he had not been Entertain'd by the <HI>Conbon;</HI> but he must go to the Gene|ral's Court the next Morning.</P>
<P>After this <HI>Nobel</HI> acquainted the Ambassador, that he had spoke with <HI>Lapora</HI> and one of <HI>Singlamong</HI>'s Factors, about Bartering for Silk, and that <HI>Lapora</HI> had told him the Vice-Roy would deliver Silk to the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> at <HI>Tenhay,</HI> pro|vided they would leave Money for Security at <HI>Hoksieu.</HI></P>
<P>The twenty fourth in the Morning the Ambassador went to the General, into whose Presence he was brought, after a stay of half an hour in the Court; being plac'd by him, the General said, That the Embassy now was compleat, and he might depart when he pleas'd; for he had receiv'd a Letter from the Emperor, in which he was commanded not to detain, but to dispatch him so soon as possible; so that his Excellency had already stay'd beyond the limited time. To which the Ambassador answer'd, He would now therefore endea|vor to part in Friendship, and as he had said before, be gone by the twelfth of that instant Moon, which if his Highness judg'd too long, he would go sooner: who straight reply'd, That if the Ambassador went away by that time, it would be very well; but he must carry no Silk-Stuffs with him, because they were Counterband Goods: yet the Ambassador being come a remote Journey, he granted him to carry <HI>Porcelane,</HI> and the like Trifles; for which he return'd thanks: which pleasing his Highness, he said, That he knew not of the Am|bassador's coming, which if he had, he would have prepar'd something for his Entertainment; but however he hop'd he would accept of a Collation at his Lodgings. Then the Ambassador thanking his Highness, and seeing that the General did not make mention of the <HI>Overveens</HI> stay, said (as he had done the day before to the <HI>Conbon,</HI>) That the <HI>Toucies</HI> had told him, that the Ship which was come with the Renegade <HI>Chineses</HI> from <HI>Quelang,</HI> and likewise the Company that Mann'd it must stay there; therefore the Ambassador desir'd, if it were
<PB N="356" REF="219">
possible, that the Ship might go along with him. The General having consi|der'd a little answer'd, That the Ship must stay; but if his Lordship would leave any body at <HI>Lamthay,</HI> was in his own choice: After some Discourse con|cerning it, the Ambassador said, That if his Highness would please to credit him, it was all one to him whether he left any one at <HI>Lamthay</HI> or not.</P>
<P>Mean while the <HI>Conbon</HI> coming thither went first into a private Chamber, and a little while after plac'd himself by the General. Then the Ambassador began again to speak of the staying of the Ship: To which the General an|swer'd, The Ambassador need not be afraid, he would take care concerning the Vessel, that nothing of any harm should befall the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> Which An|swer satisfying the Ambassador, he deliver'd such another List of the remain|ing Goods that were to be sold, and his Presents, as the day before he had done to the <HI>Conbon;</HI> after which taking his leave he departed.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon the General's Interpreter came to tell the Ambassador, That the General, <HI>Conbon,</HI> and <HI>Manichuer</HI> would come in Person to the Lodge to search the Goods.</P>
<P>In the Evening it was resolv'd, since the General had put it to the Ambassa|dor's choice, to leave any of his People there or not, to leave none; but if any farther mention should be made, to pretend as if they would willingly leave some there, because it was known that the <HI>Tartars</HI> always did contrary to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Desires: Moreover that <HI>Nobel</HI> should the next Morning go to the <HI>Poutsiensy</HI> and <HI>Assensy,</HI> and proffer them each their several Presents; and be|cause they had ask'd to buy some Blood Coral, <HI>Nobel</HI> should take two Strings along with him, and ask but an ordinary Rate for them.</P>
<P>The twenty fifth <HI>Nobel,</HI> according to the Resolution taken the day before, went with the Presents to the <HI>Poutsiensy</HI> and <HI>Assensy,</HI> to deliver them the two Strings of Coral; and at his Return related, That they had receiv'd the Pre|sents with many thanks, and the Strings of Coral at a certain Price.</P>
<P>Mean while the <HI>Mandarin Liulavja</HI> came to the Lodge, saying that the Gene|ral would not come that day, but the following Morning to see the Goods, and that the Ambassador might Ship off all his bulky Commodities. Concern|ing the <HI>China</HI> Root which the Ambassador had requested to carry out, the Ge|neral would permit him to Transport but six <HI>Picol.</HI> The Ambassador, accord|ing to the <HI>Mandarins</HI> Request, Shipp'd of all his great Goods, but said, that if the General would not grant him to carry more than six <HI>Picol,</HI> he would not trouble himself with any.</P>
<P>The twenty sixth the Ambassador Shipp'd the Money, and all such Goods as could not be sold, and likewise their travelling Necessaries.</P>
<P>The <HI>Poutsiensy</HI> and <HI>Assensy</HI> came to the Lodge with some Grand <HI>Mandarins,</HI> to thank the Ambassador for the Presents which he had sent them, and withal to tell him, That all those who had Chests or Trunks in the Barques, must go to the Bridge to open them, because the <HI>Conbon</HI> was there in Person to see them, which accordingly was done. <HI>Nobel</HI> and some others going thither, at their Return said, That the <HI>Conbon</HI> causing some Chests to be carry'd into the Gover|nor of <HI>Minjazen</HI>'s House, had open'd and search'd them there, and also look'd upon several Gifts which the Emperor had presented them with; which not satisfying, he went Aboard the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> Frigat, and open'd all the Chests there one after another, yet found nothing of any Counterband Goods. Then he said that the Ship which was come from <HI>Quelang</HI> should stay there, and that the Governor of <HI>Minjazen</HI> would tell the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> when they came thither,
<PB N="357" REF="219">
whether <HI>Balfour</HI> should remain there or not. To which <HI>Nobel</HI> answer'd him, That he would acquaint the Ambassador with it: Whereupon taking his leave, the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> at his going away fir'd three Guns.</P>
<P>Because the Ambassador could not come to the Vice-Roy <HI>Singlamong</HI> the two last days, in regard he was told that the General, <HI>Conbon,</HI> and <HI>Manchuwer,</HI> would come to the Lodge to search his Goods, and that it was now done the day be|fore by the <HI>Conbon</HI> onely, the Ambassador, <HI>Nobel,</HI> and <HI>Harthouwer</HI> went thither the twenty sixth in the Morning to take their leaves; where he was no sooner come, but had Audience immediately granted, and soon after dispatch'd; so that the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> took their leave without urging a word of any thing. Returning to the Lodge, they found the <HI>Toucy Liulavja,</HI> who hastned their de|parture, because the limited time was already expir'd: Whereupon all things that were yet ashore were put into the Vessels, and they likewise Embarqu'd themselves to be gone at High-water.</P>
<P>In the Evening the old <HI>Conbon</HI>'s Factor came to deliver the Ambassador twenty four Pieces of Silk-Stuffs, which he said were left him by his Lord to give to his Excellency, being half for himself, and the other half for the Lord <HI>Maetzuiker:</HI> These Stuffs the Ambassador gave to several Persons.</P>
<P>Not long after the <HI>Chinese</HI> Secretary <HI>Soukjen</HI> brought a written Order from the General, that <HI>Balfour</HI> must stay behind. To which the Ambassador an|swer'd, That so soon as they were Aboard the <HI>Blyfwiik</HI> Frigat, he would speak with the <HI>Mandarins</HI> about it.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> arriv'd Aboard the <HI>Blyswiik,</HI> into which upon the <HI>Mandarins</HI> command all the Goods were Shipp'd out of the Barques, because the <HI>Mansjuwer</HI> (of whom they were very fearful) should not see, nor search the Goods a second time; which was accordingly perform'd on a sud|den: but the Provisions they permitted to lie somewhat longer in the Barques, that the Cattel might the better be preserv'd alive, because the Ship was so full.</P>
<P>The twenty eighth in the Morning some <HI>Mandarins</HI> coming to the Barques with Provisions, caus'd all things that were in them to be thrown into the Ship, by which means a great many of the Cattel dy'd; all which the <HI>Nether|landers</HI> endur'd with patience, stowing their Goods as well as they could.</P>
<P>Soon after the <HI>Hollanders</HI> set Sail with a fair Wind, and a Tyde of Ebb, which coming stronger in the Afternoon, they got within a quarter of a League from the <HI>Losantat</HI> or great Tower, where they came to an Anchor; which was no sooner done but several <HI>Mandarins</HI> came Aboard them, saying that <HI>Balfour</HI> must stay, and not go from thence before an Answer came from the Emperor. To which the Ambassador answer'd, That the General had left the staying of <HI>Balfour</HI> to his choice, on which he rely'd, therefore did not believe the <HI>Manda|rins.</HI> Moreover, as to what concern'd the Ship, they should believe him, that she should stay there on condition they would furnish her with Provisions; which if they would not do, she should go. The <HI>Mandarins</HI> us'd many argu|ments to perswade the Ambassador to let <HI>Balfour,</HI> or some Person else stay in his stead: But the Ambassador not varying from his first Resolution, they took their leaves.</P>
<P>The twenty ninth the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> weighing Anchor again, drove with the Tyde of Ebb by the great Tower and Fort of <HI>Minjazen,</HI> where they found them all up in Arms. Some <HI>Batsiangs</HI> coming from the Shore call'd to the <HI>Ne|therlanders</HI> to come to an Anchor: but they not hearkning to them, went on;
<PB N="358" REF="220">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
just before they pass'd the Fort, the third Person of <HI>Minjazen</HI> came by the side of the Ship in a small <HI>Champan,</HI> to tell the Ambassador that the Governor would fain speak with him. To which he answer'd, Tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> when he was come to <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, the Governor might come and speak with him there when he pleas'd; with which Answer they went away again, not bringing word when he would come or not.</P>
<P>Moreover, besides several sorts of other Vessels (as is at large related in the Description) most of the Rivers are Navigated by <HI>Champan</HI> and <HI>Batsiangs,</HI> which are small Vessels. They rise up round with a broad Head; the Stern is not joyn'd together, but on the top is separated; between which a Mat holds an Oar, wherewith he makes swift Way; the middle is cover'd with a Mat of Rushes: He which Steers (as represented in the Sculp) is Habited in a Coat made of <HI>Coco</HI> Leaves, and he in the Head hath a kind of Umbrella on his Head against the Rain.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> also keep great Feasts in their Vessels on the River, making Merry with varieties of Meat and strong Liquor; in which manner the great|est <HI>Mandarins</HI> often recreate themselves, but in bigger Boats than the common People use, with a fine Covering over them, on each end of which stands gene|rally a Man with a crooked Horn.</P>
<P>Against the Evening the Tyde of Ebb being spent, they dropt Anchor about half a League from the <HI>Overueen</HI> Frigat, lying in <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven; whither the Ambassador immediately sent his Sloop, with Orders for her Boat to come and take out some of the Cattel, and likewise that the Sloop should go to the rest of the Ships to hasten their Boats to fetch Provisions.</P>
<P>In the Evening the <HI>Overveens</HI> Boat coming thither, they loaded her full of living Cattel, with which they sent her again Aboard.</P>
<P>The thirtieth about Noon they drove with the Tyde Ebb through the se|cond <HI>Strait,</HI> and coming within a Cannon Shot of the <HI>Overveen</HI> they ran aground on the Point of the Western Shoal in <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven; from whence getting
<PB N="359" REF="220">

off again, about Midnight at high Water they came to an Anchor close by the <HI>Overveen.</HI></P>
<P>The first of <HI>December</HI> nothing hapned.<NOTE PLACE="marg">December.</NOTE></P>
<P>The second, the Ambassador hoping to put off some more of their Goods, wrote the following Letter to the General at <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> viz.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>The <HI>Hollanders</HI> have sufficiently testifi'd their Reality; and the Ambassador esteems nothing more than to shew, that what he hath promis'd to <HI>Talavja</HI> may be perform'd. Your Lordship hath been pleas'd to command, that the Ship from <HI>Quelang,</HI> and the Com|mander <HI>Balfour</HI> should stay here till an Answer came from <HI>Peking;</HI> now the Ambassador desires to know how long the Ship must stay. Besides, since his coming hither he hath found some Goods, <HI>viz.</HI> Blood Coral, Amber, Cloth, and other Merchandise, brought in the Ships from <HI>Batavia,</HI> and likely to be carry'd back again thither, unless Your Lordship will be pleas'd this one time to give leave to sell them, because they were included in this <HI>Chinkon.</HI> The Ambassador hopes that the Emperor's Letters to the Lord <HI>Maetzuiker</HI> will bring him good tydings, therefore he could not but acquaint <HI>Talavja</HI> herewith, and desire his Answer upon it, especially having seen by some Letters which he found in the Ships, that the General of <HI>Batavia</HI> might be mov'd to deliver the Castle of <HI>Quelang</HI> to the Emperor, if he would grant the <HI>Hollanders</HI> a free Trade in <HI>China.</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P><HI>Nobel</HI> and the Secretary <HI>Vander Does</HI> were sent to the <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonks lying in the <HI>Crab-hole,</HI> to enquire if there were none Aboard that could Translate the fore-mention'd Letter, and deliver it to the General, which if there were they should leave it with them. But their coming amongst the Jonks caus'd great amazement amongst them, neither could they be accommodated; so they went to the Jonks which lay within the second <HI>Strait,</HI> where finding some <HI>Manda|rins</HI> and a Secretary with them, they did their Business according to their desire.</P>
<P>This Letter being Translated <HI>Nobel</HI> sent with a <HI>Batsiang</HI> up to <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> with promise to return with an Answer within two days; so that the Ambassador judg'd it convenient to stay so long with the <HI>Blyswiik</HI> in <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven.</P>
<P><PB N="360" REF="221">The third in the Morning, the <HI>Mandarins</HI> of the Jonks came aboard the <HI>Bleis|wyk,</HI> saying, That they durst not carry the Letter which <HI>Nobel</HI> had given them the day before, except a <HI>Hollander</HI> went with them to <HI>Hoksieu:</HI> Whereupon, the Ambassador answer'd, That if they would not deliver the Letters, they knew what they had to do; if any thing other than well did come of it, it was not his fault.</P>
<P>This, startling, made them change their resolution, asking if they should deli|ver the Letter, and the General should desire, that a <HI>Hollander</HI> should come to him, if the Ambassador would then promise them to send one thither, of which they would willingly be assur'd, that they might give his Highness a positive answer.</P>
<P>The Ambassador, after serious consideration, judg'd it convenient to an|swer, That they should Request of the Governor of <HI>Minjazeen,</HI> in the Ambassa|dor's Name, if he would please to send any one with that Letter to the <HI>Sontok,</HI> and if they had an answer upon it, and that <HI>Talavja</HI> Commanded, that an <HI>Hollan|der</HI> should come to him, that then they would consider of it; with which an|swer going away, they took the Letter with them.</P>
<P>The fourth, it was thought meet by the Ambassador and his Councel, since they had nothing more to do there, only to wait for News from above, to set Sail for <HI>Tinghay,</HI> to make all things ready there; but <HI>Nobel</HI> was order'd to stay there with the <HI>Overveen,</HI> that if any News should come from <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> he might inform the Ambassador of it, and give such Orders as should be requisite.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon the Ambassador fell down with the <HI>Bleiswyk</HI> to the first <HI>Straight,</HI> behind the <HI>Pyramids,</HI> where they dropp'd Anchor till the next Ebb, but were forc'd by a strong Gale out of the North-East, to remove beyond the first Shole, and wait for better Weather.</P>
<P>The fifth in the Night, the <HI>Bleiswyk</HI> set Sail again with a Northerly Wind and Ebbing Water; and getting beyond the <HI>Calf Sands,</HI> came on the seventh in the Morning, by Day-light, before <HI>Sotias Bay,</HI> within the <HI>Turrets Isles,</HI> that in the Afternoon, with a Sea breeze, he might put into the Bay of <HI>Tinghay.</HI></P>
<P>Having cast Anchor, the Ambassador went with the <HI>Bleiswyk</HI>'s Sloop aboard the <HI>Victoria,</HI> to stay and go over in her.</P>
<P>Here it was judg'd convenient, that <HI>Nobel</HI> and <HI>Putmans,</HI> with the Ship <HI>Bata|via,</HI> and <HI>Harthouwer,</HI> and <HI>Bartolz</HI> with the <HI>Crane,</HI> if no other News came from <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> should set Sail for <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>In the Afternoon, the <HI>Bleiswyk</HI> Frigat came also to <HI>Tinghay,</HI> where the Am|bassador immediately unladed part of her, distributing the Provisions and Mo|ney amongst the Ships <HI>Victoria, Batavia,</HI> and <HI>Crane,</HI> that so he might not run the hazard of all in one Ship.</P>
<P>The eighth in the Afternoon, the <HI>Overveen</HI>'s Boat arriv'd at <HI>Tinghay</HI> from <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, with a Letter from <HI>Nobel,</HI> Dated the Night before, the Con|tents of which were:</P>
<P>That two Commanders had been aboard him, with a Letter from the Ge|neral of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> to the Governor of <HI>Minjazeen,</HI> of which he had sent the Tran|slation Inclos'd.</P>
<P>The Superscription they could not give to <HI>Nobel,</HI> for want of some to write it; the <HI>Povi,</HI> as they said, had accounted himself too good to answer the Am|bassador, but had writ to the Governor of <HI>Minjazeen,</HI> not expecting any fur|ther answer from the Ambassador, as might be seen by the last Clause.</P>
<P>To the Proposal of <HI>Quelang,</HI> he had sent no manner of answer, But that the
<PB N="361" REF="221">
Lord General, according to the foremention'd Commanders sayings, must the ensuing Year write himself to the Emperor, concerning that or the like business.</P>
<P>And in like manner, about the selling of the Merchandize, as appears by the second Clause; by which they may plainly see, that the Ships with their Mer|chandize must be gone again, which was strongly affirm'd by the third Clause, as appears by the Translation.</P>
<P>In the Translation, no mention was made in how many days an answer would be there from <HI>Peking,</HI> as the Ambassador had desir'd to know; besides, no body came to look after the <HI>Overveen,</HI> to furnish her with Provisions, which they had so faithfully promis'd, and to his judgment there was no staying for it: The Tydes and Weather were good, which with the approaching New Moon, according to the general course of that season, might turn to be bad and tempestuous.</P>
<P>Therefore he expected the Ambassador's Order, whether the <HI>Overveen</HI> should stay longer in <HI>Netherland</HI> Haven, or go to <HI>Tinhay:</HI> The foremention'd Transla|tion written by the General of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> to the Governor of <HI>Minjazeen,</HI> was to this effect.</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM><HI>I.</HI> THe <HI>Povi</HI> hath receiv'd the Letter from the <HI>Holland</HI> Ambassador, wherein he de|sir'd to know, how many days <HI>Balfour</HI> should lie there with his Ship: My Answer thereupon is, that he shall stay till Order comes from the Emperor.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>II.</HI> The Foreign Commodities are forbid by the Emperor to be sold, therefore I cannot grant the Ambassadors Request; but when the Lord General shall send Letters the following Year, then I will write to the Emperor about it.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>III.</HI> According to the Emperor's Command, it is not well done, that the Ambassador stays so long, because it will not be good for their business the ensuing Year, when they would come thither again.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>IV.</HI> Lastly, I Command you to deliver this Letter to the Ambassador, and to acquaint me so soon as he is gone from our Coast: Hereupon I expect a speedy Answer.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P><HI>Nobel</HI>'s writing concerning the <HI>Overveen,</HI> being by the Ambassador and his Councel consider'd on, it was judg'd convenient to send for the Frigat to <HI>Tinghay.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore the Ambassador inform'd <HI>Nobel,</HI> that he had receiv'd his Letter with the Translation, and thereby understood, that <HI>Povi</HI> had answer'd very slightly concerning <HI>Balfours</HI> and the <HI>Overveens</HI> staying, without being able to depend upon it; their hopes of venting their Merchandize, was also now quite vanish'd, so that he resolv'd, and had found it convenient to send for the <HI>Overveen</HI> to <HI>Tinghay,</HI> because the Governors did not keep their promise in fur|nishing her with Provisions.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Chineses</HI> should ask him the reason of the Ships going away, he should answer them, that it should lie under <HI>Tinghay,</HI> so long as they had any Provisi|ons left whereby he might see if they intended to keep her there any longer, and govern himself accordingly.</P>
<P>Theninth nothing happen'd of remark.</P>
<P>The tenth, three <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonks that came out of the North Sail'd by the Am|bassador in the <HI>Victoria,</HI> up the Channel of <HI>Hoksieu.</HI> In the Afternoon <HI>No|bel</HI> arriv'd at <HI>Tinghay</HI> in the <HI>Overveen,</HI> and having dropt Anchor, he went aboard of the Ambassador, to tell him, That the eighth instant in the Evening,
<PB N="362" REF="222">
some petty Officers were come aboard from the <HI>Chinese</HI> Jonks, to ask when the Ambassador would set Sail, and <HI>Nobel</HI> go from thence with the Frigat? To which he had answer'd, That the Ambassador would leave that place with the first fair Weather, and that he would be gone from thence with the <HI>Overveen</HI> the next Morning, with which they seeming to be pleas'd, took their leave.</P>
<P>The twelfth, it was resolv'd in Councel, upon the Ambassador's Proposal on the seventeenth instant, if good Weather, to set Sail for <HI>Batavia,</HI> without urging the Governors any more to permit them to Trade, because they saw, by all Circumstances, that no good was to be done there that year.</P>
<P>The fourteenth, the <HI>Overveen</HI> Frigat set Sail by <HI>Siam</HI> to <HI>Batavia,</HI> according to their resolution taken on the twelfth: Soon after her departure, two <HI>Chinese Coya's</HI> came to <HI>Tinghay,</HI> where some Officers coming to the Ambassador said, That they were sent by the Governor of <HI>Minjazeen,</HI> to enquire when the Ambas|sador would be gone: Who answering, said, That he had been indispos'd, or else he would have been gone e're that time, but that he resolv'd three or four days hence to set Sail from <HI>Tinghay.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, the Ambassador told them, that it was very strange to him, that no advice came from <HI>Peking,</HI> about the coming of the Ships, because he had ac|quainted the <HI>Lipous,</HI> that he expected Ships to come to <HI>Hoksieu</HI> with Merchan|dize, and also to fetch him, and that the <HI>Lipous</HI> had answer'd him, that so soon as they receiv'd advice from the General, they would consult, and give Order concerning it: But since no order was come from the <HI>Lipous,</HI> it was a sign that the General or Governor of <HI>Minjazeen</HI> had not yet written about it to <HI>Peking;</HI> and considering he had inform'd the <HI>Lipous</HI> of it himself, they would resent it very ill, when they should hear of the Ships being there, and they were not acquainted with it, and serve this General and the Governor of <HI>Minjazeen,</HI> as the former General had been; for it would be a business of great Consequence, to let the Ambassador go away with three such deep laden Vessels. Hereupon the Officers making no reply, said, That if the Ambassador did stay some days longer, that several <HI>Mandarins</HI> would come to him in great Jonks from the Ge|neral in <HI>Hoksieu:</HI> To which the Ambassador reply'd, That they, and who e're else came, should be welcome to him, and receiv'd as friends, desiring that they would acquaint the Governor of <HI>Minjazeen</HI> with what he had said; which they promising to do, ask'd to know the day on which the Ambassador would de|part, which he said, would be the third from that, and if any one came to him in the interim, it was well, but if none came, he would assuredly be gone; with which answer they return'd.</P>
<P>The fifth in the Morning, the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> saw four Jonks, and two <HI>Coya's</HI> coming out of the Channel of <HI>Hoksieu,</HI> which the next Morning were seen about the <HI>Wood-Bay,</HI> where they stood to and again without coming nearer to the Ships: But the <HI>Coya's</HI> came close to them, out of one of which, a Servant be|longing to the Governor of <HI>Minjazeen,</HI> came in a <HI>Champan</HI> or small Boat aboard the Ambassador, sent to him from his Master, to enquire concerning his Ex|cellency's Health, and when he would set Sail; and said moreover, that the <HI>Po|vi</HI> had writ to the Emperor, that the Ambassador went away from thence the twelfth of the last Moon, and now it was publickly known, that his Excellency was not yet gone; therefore he came to know the certain time, when the Am|bassador would set Sail, and withal, to tell him, that if he intended to stay any longer, he should go and lie between the Isles, without the sight of the main Land; and to declare his mind, whether he would be gone, or not. To which
<PB N="363" REF="222">
the Ambassador answer'd, That he would set Sail from thence, but that the General and Governor of <HI>Minjazeen</HI> might perhaps answer for it, that they let the Ambassador go away with three such deep laden Vessels; with which an|swer, the Servant took his leave.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> saw that the Jonks which kept without shot from them, made into the Channel again with their <HI>Coya's,</HI> they according to their resolution taken on the twelfth, made Preparations to set Sail for <HI>Batavia.</HI></P>
<P>The seventeenth in the Morning, the Ambassador set Sail with four Ships, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Victoria, Batavia, Crane,</HI> and <HI>Bleiswyk,</HI> from the ruin'd City <HI>Tinghay;</HI> and Steering his Course East-South-East, between the <HI>Turret-Isles,</HI> close by the Island <HI>Naerd,</HI> and about Midnight, guessing themselves to be past the <HI>Rough-Isle,</HI> they Steer'd South-West and by West: In the middle of the Morning-Watch, the Wind began to rise, and the next day prov'd very Stormy, when as they sup|pos'd they saw the Isle of <HI>Quemuy;</HI> as the following day they judg'd from their Soundings, that they were near the Sandy Banks.</P>
<P>The twentieth, passing the <HI>Makaw</HI> Islands, they Steer'd their Course to the Isle of <HI>Ainan,</HI> which was descry'd on the two and twentieth, having <HI>Tinhosa</HI> about Noon, two Leagues and a half Northward from them.</P>
<P>The Ambassador having been indispos'd for some days, and beginning daily to grow weaker, by reason of the hollow Seas, and small Breezes, which made the Ship roul much, he sent the <HI>Bleiswyk</HI> on the twenty fourth to the <HI>Overveen</HI> and <HI>Crane,</HI> to tell them, that they should keep together, and he would with the <HI>Bleis|wyk</HI> go before to the Island <HI>Pulo Timaon,</HI> where he would stay for them.</P>
<P>In the Evening, there being a Serene Sky, the Ambassador saw the Moun|tain of <HI>Sinesecuwe</HI> on his side, and in the Morning the <HI>Cape Avarelles Valze.</HI> The Wind being at North-East, and their Course along the shore South and by West, and South-South-West, they came in the Evening up with the Point of <HI>Holland&punc;</HI> from whence they Steer'd South-West and by South, to raise <HI>Paul Can|dor,</HI> which Isle they saw in the West, on the six and twentieth in the Afternoon; and the next Evening, Anchor'd behind the <HI>Goats Horns,</HI> where the <HI>Crane</HI> also arriv'd the following day.</P>
<P>The last of <HI>October,</HI> the <HI>Batavia</HI> Frigat arriv'd at the South-East side of <HI>Paulo Timaon,</HI> but the Wind shrinking, she was forc'd to drop Anchor half a League from that wherein the Ambassador was aboard.</P>
<P>Here the Ambassador gave Order to take the Silver out of the <HI>Victoria</HI> and <HI>Crane,</HI> and put it into the <HI>Bleiswyk</HI> again, and likewise sent his Sloops to the <HI>Batavia,</HI> to fetch the Silver out of her: Whereupon, the <HI>Bleiswyk</HI> was according to their Excellencies Order in <HI>Batavia,</HI> sent with all the Silver, Gold, and other Commodities to <HI>Malakka,</HI> to the Governor <HI>Balthazar Bort,</HI> to be sent from thence to <HI>Bengale.</HI></P>
<P>The Ambassador inform'd him by Letters, that he was receiv'd with all kindness at the Court in <HI>Peking,</HI> and left the same with much Honor and Friend|ship; but could not inform him, what was obtain'd by this Embassy, because the Emperor had sent his Letters Seal'd to the Lord General; but that it was certain, that for the future they should Trade in <HI>Canton,</HI> and not in <HI>Hoksieu;</HI> in the removal of which, if all things else were well, he found little trouble.</P>
<P>The first of <HI>Ianuary,</HI> the Fleet left <HI>Paulo Timaon,</HI> and in the Afternoon, the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ianuary.</NOTE> <HI>Bleiswyk</HI> taking leave of the Fleet, steer'd her Course to the <HI>Streights</HI> of <HI>Sinkka|pura.</HI> In the Evening, the Ambassador saw <HI>Pulo Aura,</HI> a League and a half North-East from him.</P>

<P>Thus having brought the Embassy out of <HI>China</HI> to <HI>Batavia,</HI> we will return thither again, and declare what properly concerns the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and their Coun|trey; and first begin with their Entertainments and Diet.</P>

<HEAD>Feasts, or Entertainments.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Chineses,</HI> according to <HI>Alvarez Semedo,</HI> spend most of their time in Feasting, with extraordinary Costs and Charges. On the meeting of Friends, and good success in any Business, they prepare a Feast; and some|times also in Troubles and Adversities, in which they come to comfort each other; nay, at Entertainments, are the Consultations of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> advising with one another at Meals what they shall take in Hand.</P>
<P>This is the usual life of the Common People, and especially of Handicrafts|men, which are divided into Companies, which they call <HI>Mane,</HI> because in eve|ry Company are thirty Masters, (as many as there are days in a Month) which make a Feast every day by turns.</P>
<P>If they have not Conveniencies in their own Houses, they may hire publick Halls, in which are all manner of Necessaries, being built for that purpose; or if they will keep their Feasts in their own Houses, without any further trouble, then they only set down the number of the Persons, Guests, and Re|tinue, and what Dishes they will please to order, which are punctually serv'd in, according to the Bill of Fare.</P>
<P>The Northern <HI>Chineses</HI> differ much in their Customs from the Southern, who are in general, more civiliz'd than the other.</P>
<P>The Southern <HI>Chineses,</HI> in their Feasts esteem of a <HI>Quelque-chose,</HI> or of Minc'd Meats and Hashes, more than great Joynts and standing Dishes, entertain|ing more upon the score of good Society than Debauches; yet they will do their parts well at their Trencher, and as sufficiently at the turning off their Glasses: They are entertain'd with Wine before Dinner, of which they take and taste till they refuse; then they fall to their Rice, and neither speak nor Drink till pretty well satisfi'd.</P>
<P>The manner of the Northern <HI>Chineses</HI> is quite otherwise, for they are not Ce|remonious nor Complemental, but delight in well-fill'd Tables, with great and full Dishes.</P>
<P>After the usual Ceremony which is observ'd through all <HI>China,</HI> they begin first with Eating, every one taking as much as he can on his Trencher, of what he likes best, which they eat without Drinking.</P>
<P>Rice is their Banquet.</P>
<P>After Meals, they spend an hour in talking, which ended, they seat them|selves again, at Tables fill'd with Potation-Dishes, and Salt-Meats, as Gam|mons of Bacon, dry'd Tongues, and the like, which they do not without cause call <HI>Ushers,</HI> or <HI>Vehiculums,</HI> preparers of the way, that the Tope may the better go down; for they no sooner take a Relishing Bit, but a lusty Go|down follows.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="223">They keep their Breakfasts at seven a Clock in the Morning, and their Din|ners at five in the Afternoon, but drink no Wine at either: Only at Night, at a light Supper of relishing Meat, they give themselves full liberty and fresh scope of good Fellowship; therefore their Feasts are Nocturnal, spending the Day upon their serious, either Business, Exercise, or Studies.</P>
<P>In the Winter Nights they use Candles made of Oyl mix'd with Wax, but their Summer Lights are of three sorts of Wax, one of Bees, another of certain Snakes, which is very white, and the third comes from a Tree call'd <HI>Kieujeu,</HI> but that is not so good as our <HI>European,</HI> yet much better than our Tallow, and their Candles likewise exceed ours.</P>
<P>Persons of Quality make great Preparations for their Feasts, Erecting Ban|queting Houses for that purpose, both in the Cities, and at their Countrey Houses, furnish'd with Pictures and other Rarities: And though the use of Hangings be very rare, yet if those that are invited to a Feast be Officers or Noblemen, they furnish their Houses with Tapestry, from the top to the bot|tom: The number of Tables is a testimony of the greatness of their Enter|tainment: They generally place no more than four Persons at a Table; but at very grand Meetings, every Guest hath a peculiar and sometimes two Ta|bles, one to sit at, and the other to set away his empty Dishes.</P>
<P>The Tables are neither cover'd with Clothes nor Napkins, but Varnish'd with the Wax of the Gum call'd <HI>Cie:</HI> They use no Knives, for all their Meat, except Eggs, Fish, and the like, is brought before them ready Hash'd: Neither use they Forks nor Spoons, but two small Sticks two handfuls long, with which they very dexterously and neatly take up their Meat; nay, put a single Corn of Rice, either raw or boyl'd to their Mouth, without letting it fall. They never put Salt, Pepper, nor Vinegar or Verjuice amongst their Meat, but Mu|stard and the like Ingredients, which they Compound with extraordinary Art, having several of them of a curious relish.</P>
<P>Their common Dishes are Flesh and Fish, boyl'd, or broyl'd on Grid-Irons, and fry'd in Pans, with variety of Sauces, not unpleasing to the Palate.</P>
<P>Their <HI>Pottages,</HI> of which they are great lovers, are never made without either Flesh or Fish.</P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>Che,</HI> who began his Reign before the Birth of our Saviour, <HI>Anno</HI> 1150. first us'd Sticks of Ivory to Eat with, and Ivory Dishes; but these Sticks are not always made of Ivory, but sometimes of Ebony, or some other such like Materials, and tipt only at the ends, with which they touch the Meat, with Silver or Gold; yet the Inhabitants of the Counties <HI>Iunningfu,</HI> in the Pro|vince of <HI>Iunnan,</HI> a Rustick and Salvage People, use not the foremention'd Sticks, but put the Meat into their Mouths, sooping it down by whole handfuls.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> sit at their Tables, on high and artificial wrought Stools, and not cross-Legg'd like the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>Anciently they us'd neither Stools nor Tables, but sat on the Ground cross-Legg'd, after the same manner as most of the <HI>Asiatick</HI> and <HI>African</HI> People yet do, insomuch, that they have but one Character for a Table and a Carpet.</P>
<P>Tables were first brought in use among the <HI>Chineses,</HI> near the Raign of the Emperor <HI>Han,</HI> which ever since they have observ'd, and have them and their Stools very curious.</P>
<P>They use many Ceremonies, as well in the middle, as in the beginning o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> ending of their Feasts: The Master of the House, as their Taster, first sitting down, when he hath taken a Morsel and tasted the Liquor, then recommend|ing,
<PB N="366" REF="224">
invites his Friends to sit down, and do the like. In the middle of their Feast they change their small Dishes into great, and all present, Masters, and whatsoever, have the freedom of drinking what they please, but none inforc'd to more.</P>
<P>Persons of Quality make Feasts when they return from a Journey, and it often happens, that one Man will go to seven or eight Feasts in a day, only to oblige his Friends by his Presence. When they have time, they send some days before Letters to peculiar Friends, desiring them to come to their Feasts, which if they cannot, being otherwise ingag'd, then they excuse themselves again by a Letter, and they put off their Feasts till they can come; with which they ac|quaint them by another Letter, call'd <HI>A Letter of Request:</HI> At the day appoint|ed, those that are there first, stay without in a Hall till all the rest are come, then they go into the Dining-Room, where the Master of the House using some Ceremonies, puts all things in a readiness, which done every one seats himself according to his Quality; and the Invitor sits down in State, to animate his Guests to Eat and Drink: They sit a lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">g while at Table; for besides their Discourses, they have Musick and Comedians, who strait Personate whatever they call for or desire.</P>
<P>Their Feasts end in many Complements, which the Guests make to the Master, to whom they send a Letter the next Morning, extolling the noble Entertainment, and all things thereto belonging, and hearty thanks for the ho|nor which they receiv'd by it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses,</HI> as <HI>Trigaut</HI> witnesseth, eat all manner of Dainties which we have in <HI>Europe,</HI> and very well know how to dress and prepare them, but they bring but very little of a sort to their Tables; for they account the glory of their Feast to consist in the variety of <HI>Petits</HI> and Hotch-potches: neither do they eat Flesh and Fish apart, as we, but mix them together.</P>
<P>Moreover, no manner of Meat being once put on the Table is taken away till Dinner is ended; wherefore they not onely fill the Tables, setting one Dish by another, but heap them up like their own Turrets. No Bread nor Rice is set on the Table before the Guests, except at some small Feasts, or to|wards the latter end; if there be, then they drink no Wine, for the <HI>Chineses</HI> drink not any before Rice.</P>
<P>They have also several Games at their Feasts, like ours, where every one that loseth is forc'd to take up his Cup, at which all the rest rejoyce and clap their Hands.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> are very mannerly at Meals, and keep their Dinners early. Mushroms they account a great Dainty, sending for them from the Mountain <HI>Tienno,</HI> lying in the County of <HI>Hancheufu,</HI> belonging to the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> near the small City <HI>Lingan.</HI> They are carry'd through all <HI>China,</HI> and being Salt|ed and dry'd last good a whole year: They steep them first in Water before they boyl them, by which means they become as fresh again as when first gather'd.</P>
<P>In no place in all <HI>China</HI> is more Butter and Milk us'd than in the City of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Atl.

<P>The Inhabitants of the twelfth County <HI>Xunningfu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Iunnan,</HI> a salvage People, stick not to eat, according to the foremention'd <HI>Martinius,</HI> all manner of Creatures that are not venomous.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="224">The People of the fourth Territory <HI>Chingvenfu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Queicheu,</HI> have no Salt, but use the Ashes of an Herb call'd <HI>Kine</HI> in stead thereof.</P>
<P>Amongst those of the Province <HI>Kiangsi</HI> are some, which all the year long ga|ther up the Bones of dead Cattel, and lay them in <HI>Porcelane</HI> Dishes at their Feasts, to fill up their empty Platters, that their Dishes may be heap'd one upon another, according to the Custom of the Countrey.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Marriages and Matrimonial Ceremonies.</HEAD>
<P>THree thousand years since to this day, according to an inviolable Law, Marriages have been observ'd in <HI>China.</HI> Antiently they us'd many Ce|remonies in Betrothing each other; and amongst others, to give their Hands as we do; but most of them are chang'd, some quite extinguish'd, and others new. At this day they observe two kinds of Marriages, one firm, as with us, not to be dissolv'd but by the Death of one or both. In this the Woman is con|ducted with many Ceremonies to her Husbands House. The second is a kind of Concubinate, yet suffer'd by that Countrey amongst such as have no Chil|dren; but that limitation is a meer pretence, for the Rich take Concubines or Mistresses, without any scruple, though they have several Children.</P>
<P>In this the Betrothing differs much from that of a true and lawful Marri|age; for here they Treat with the reputed Father or Fosters of a Maiden, which in truth having no Relation, but have onely brought them up with intent to sell them to the first amorous Chapman. But to speak properly this is no Mar|riage, because neither any Promises, nor Matrimonial Ceremonies pass be|tween them; for the Law of the Countrey permit all Women to take any other Man, if the first hath put her off. Besides, these Concubines eat apart by themselves in peculiar Rooms, and are under obedience of the lawful Wives, being at their Command as Servants on all occasions: Neither do their Chil|dren shew that obedience to them, as those of the lawful Wives do, neither call them by the Name of <HI>Mother.</HI> At their Death those Children which are born of them, are not oblig'd to Mourn three years, nor desist from their Study, nor leave their Employment or Government, as the legitimate Issue do at their Fa|thers or Mothers Death.</P>
<P>At the Man's Decease the legal Wife and Children possess the Estate in common; but if the Wife die, the Concubine still remains with the Husband, and so do the Children if she hath any.</P>
<P>There are some that take Mistresses onely to beget Sons; whom when grown and mature, if the lawful Wife do not affect, they are sent abroad, or else Marry'd to some other; yet the Child that is thus Begotten and Born, acknowledges no other Mother than the true and lawful Wife.</P>
<P>Widows are permitted to Marry if they please; but modest and chaste Wo|men seldom do, though young and without Children, but live retir'd in their Father-in-laws House, for which they are highly esteem'd.</P>
<P>In lawful Marriages they commonly observe the Constitutions, Qualities, Conditions, and Likeness of the Persons; but in the other they look onely upon Beauty and Breeding.</P>
<P>None, according to their Laws, may Marry their Fathers Relation, in what Degree soever, nor with a Person of the same Name, but freely with their Mothers Friends, though never so near Ally'd.</P>
<P><PB N="368" REF="225">A Virgin seldom Marries a Widower, they being call'd, <HI>The Bed and Plea|sure of the House.</HI></P>
<P>No Marriages are Contracted without a <HI>Procurator,</HI> though they have been never so great Friends; to which purpose one is chosen out of the number of those Men and Women who folllow no other Trade.</P>
<P>The Bridegroom never sees his Bride but at the going in of the Door, where he receives her as his Wife.</P>
<P>The Fathers bestow their Children in Marriage when they are very young, and sometimes in their Infancy, nay before they are Born, whether Male or Female: Their Promises in this kind are faithfully perform'd, notwithstand|ing the Father dies before the time, except one of the betrothed happens to be defam'd and lose his Estate, or both Parties disagree. If the Son for some pri|vate Reasons will not perform his Fathers Commands, he may be forc'd to it by the Laws of the Countrey.</P>
<P>No mention is made of the Bride or Bridegrooms Portion till their Fathers Death.</P>
<P>Amongst Persons of meaner Quality it is not customary to buy Women, but onely they give their Brides Father a piece of Money to buy her Garments and Attires, according to their Capacity; from whence perhaps some have averr'd by mistake that the <HI>Chineses</HI> buy their Wives.</P>
<P>Persons of Quality never speak of the Brides Portion, because her Father is oblig'd by the Laws of the Countrey to do what he can, and to provide them Housholdstuff from the Door (as they say there) to the top of the Chimney, except the Bed; all which seldom amounts to above fifty Crowns, so low a Price do Goods bear in <HI>China.</HI> Besides which the Father gives his Daughter two or three Maids to wait upon her, and some Silver, but never Lands or Houses, unless he be very rich, or else Marries her to a Person of Quality, or that he hath no Heir Male himself. After they are Betrothed, with their Pa|rents consents, then begin their Complements and Courtships: And first, the Bridegroom sends the Bride a Present of some delicate Meat, Wine, and Fruit; Secondly, the Marriage-Day is pitch'd upon by Astronomers with great Ce|remonies; Thirdly, the Brides Name enquir'd for; Lastly, the Bridegroom must send her some Jewels, Pendants, and Precious Gems.</P>
<P>The day before the Bride comes home to her Husbands House, her Goods are carry'd thither from her Fathers at Noon-day by certain People employ'd for that purpose, who walk two by two, some carrying Tables, others Chests, Curtains, Hangings, and the like.</P>
<P>The next day, as it is customary in some Provinces, the new Marry'd Man, his Father and nearest Relations, go to seek the Bride, whom having found, they conduct home in State in a Sedan.</P>
<P>In other Provinces more to the South, the Man sends one in the Evening to fetch his Bride in a Sedan made for that purpose, richly Lin'd; behind fol|low a great number of People with Torches and Lanterns.</P>
<P>After the Mother hath done the last Offices for her that she shall do as a Maid, and bid her farewel, then she is lock'd up in the Sedan, and the Key sent before to her Husbands Mother. As she goes along, the nearest Relations walk before, and the Servant-Maids given her by her Father, go on each side of their Mistress. When they come thither, her Mother-in-law unlocks the Sedan, and desiring her to come forth, presents her to her Husband: Which done, they both walk to a private Chappel, in which the Images of their Pre|decessors
<PB N="369" REF="225">
are erected; where having kneel'd four times, according to the Custom in those Ceremonies, they come and shew the same Reverence to their Fathers, sitting in a large Hall on Stools.</P>
<P>Then the Bride goes away with her Mother-in-law, Chamber-Maids, and Match-makers, into the Womens Lodgings, which are kept so strictly that none dare offer to look into them, no not the Father-in-law himself, or her own Brothers; so that when a Father will punish his Son for an Offence, which is often done notwithstanding he is Married, he is safe as in a Sanctuary, if he can but get into his Wifes Chamber, because his Father dare not come thither, nor speak with his Son's Wife, except on some extraordinary occasions, such is their care for the preservation of Modesty, and the Honor of the Women.</P>
<P>They are also seldom permitted to go abroad, except on necessity, and then are carry'd in a Sedan, made for that purpose, and when lock'd up, not the least Cranny through which she can peep.</P>
<P>The Women in their Privacies, to pass away the time, entertain themselves with little Dogs, Birds, and the like pleasers of Fancy.</P>
<P>A Moneth after the Marriage Day the Bride returns to her own House, which they call <HI>Queinim,</HI> that is, <HI>Returning to Rest.</HI></P>
<P>All the Sons have equal shares of their Fathers Goods, and those of the Concubines as the begotten of lawful Wives; for in this case the Father is the onely Person that is consider'd: but as for the Daughters, they receive nothing but what is given them on their Marriage Day.</P>
<P>If the Father dies before he hath Marry'd his Daughter, then her Brothers are to provide for her; and likewise if her Father hath wasted, or given away all his Estate by Marrying of his Children, then the Brothers are oblig'd to maintain themselves.</P>
<P>There are some peculiar Families, whereof the eldest Inherits, notwithstand|ing he hath several other Brothers. The Children are call'd <HI>Quecun, Chu-Hui, Heupe Cheihei.</HI></P>
<P>And with many Ceremonies, as <HI>Trigaut</HI> witnesseth, they Betroth one ano|ther, which is done by the Parents when they are in their Infancy: But one thing they chiefly observe, which is, that the Bridegroom differs not many years in the age of the Bride. This Promising or Betrothing, the Parents make between themselves, without acquainting the Children, who nevertheless al|ways consent.</P>
<P>All Persons of Quality Marry with their Equals, chusing their Wives of as good Families as themselves.</P>
<P>As to what concerns the Concubines, which every one keeps according to his pleasure, the fairest and most beautiful are in greatest esteem, not regarding Birth or Riches; for they buy them for a hundred <HI>Ducats</HI> a piece, and sometimes less.</P>
<P>The common People or the Poor buy Wives for a small Sum, and sell them again when they please; but the Emperor and his Family in their Marri|ages look onely upon the Beauty of a Person, without regarding whether she be of Royal Extraction or not: But Women of Quality shun this Choice, partly because the Emperor's Women are of no authority for their life-times, being lock'd up in the Palace, and secluded from the Eyes of all Friends and Relations; and partly because the Magistrates of Marriages chuse but few out of many to be the Emperor's lawful Wives.</P>
<P>The Emperor hath one prime Wife, which may onely be styl'd <HI>Empress;</HI>
<PB N="370" REF="226">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
besides which he may Marry nine other, somewhat meaner, and then thirty six more, which all bear the Title of <HI>Wives.</HI> He hath also many Concubines, which are not call'd Wives, nor were ever Betrothed, whom he picks and chu|ses at his pleasure. Those which bring forth a Son are esteem'd the most, and accepted of best; and she who hath the first Male-Issue takes place, because he is to succeed his Father in the Throne.</P>
<P>This is not onely usual with the Emperor and his Family, but likewise customary through the whole Empire. The prime Wife sits with her Hus|band at the Table, and all the rest (especially those that are not related to the Imperial Blood) are Servants to the Husbands Father, and Waiting-Maids to the lawful Wife, not daring to sit in the presence of either. The Sons acknow|ledge not their real Mother, but the prime Matron, and Mourn onely when she dies three whole years, and follow no Employment during that time, which they mind not at the Death of their Mother which bare them.</P>
<P>They strictly observe that no Man Marry a Woman that hath the same Sir-name which he hath, though they are no way ally'd to one another; not in the least minding how near they are a Kin to each other, if their Names do but differ; nay, the Fathers Marry their Sons to their Mothers nearest Re|lations.</P>
<P>The Bride brings no Portion with her; and though at that day when she is carry'd to the Bride-grooms House, she takes so much Housholdstuff with her, that whole Streets are stopt up with it, yet all this is bought at the Bride|grooms Charge, who some Moneths before sends her a Sum of Money to that purpose. Thus far <HI>Trigaut.</HI></P>
<P>The Houshold generally consists in Stools, Benches, Chests, and Umbrella's. Moreover, the Bride must bring the Bridegroom a Horse and Bridle, four Ser|vant Maids, and two Boys: The Bridegroom also furnishes the Kitchin with all Provision, presents the Bride with several Pieces of Silk-Stuffs, Cotton-Cloth, and a Garland of Flowers, with a Gold Bodkin; for which she, as a
<PB N="371" REF="226">
sign of her constant Love, gives him a Sute of Cloth of Gold, or rich Silk. The Bridegroom also gives to her Father a hundred, and to her Mother fifty <HI>Tail</HI> of Silver: which done, the Wedding begins, first Entertaining each other eight days in the Bridegrooms House, and three days more at the Brides.</P>
<P>Their Weddings are very expensive, being celebrated in great State, and ended with Comedies, Masques, Musick, and the like, to the great admiration of Strangers.</P>
<P>The day after the Wedding, the new Marry'd Woman is conducted in a stately manner, attended by a great number of her Friends and nearest Relati|ons to her Husbands House, either by Water in a Pleasure&punc;boat, or by Land in a Sedan, or Chair. Upon the side of the Shore walk several Musicians and Singers, Playing on Instruments and Singing. Upon the Brides approach the Priests hold up at a distance some Golden Half-Moons, which they give to the Bride, wishing she may not change like the Moon, but embrace him with a pure and constant Affection: A great assurance they have of these Half-Moons, believing that as long as the Woman keeps them, she will never change her Love to her Husband.</P>
<P>When <HI>China</HI> was Govern'd by several Kings and Lords, they took one ano|thers<NOTE PLACE="marg">Emperors Marriages. <HI>Semedo.</HI></NOTE> Daughters to Wife as in <HI>Europe:</HI> but since those Governments were uni|ted, the Emperor hath been forc'd in his own Realm to take one or other of his Subjects Daughters, it being contrary to their Law, that the Emperor should Marry any Woman out of his own Dominions. But though the Em|peror be so bound up, yet Persons of Quality do not willingly Marry their Daughters to him, because upon trial and dislike he may send them home again. Neither may he Betroth himself to a Maid of his Alliance; therefore they search through the whole Empire for a Virgin of twelve or fourteen years of age, beautiful, and endu'd with all manner of Vertues and Breeding, after the same manner as sacred Writ testifies they sought for <HI>Abishag</HI> the <HI>Shunamite</HI> for <HI>David,</HI> and <HI>Hester</HI> for <HI>Ahasuerus:</HI> When they have found such a one according to their liking, she is put into the custody of two Ladies of Honor, antient Matrons, who search her, to see if she hath no imperfections about her Body. When those after all their Searchings have found her faultless, she is conduct|ed to the Court with a great Train, and being accepted as a Person which from that time belongs to the Emperor, she is shewn to his Majesty in his Palace. The Emperor after the usual Ceremonies pass'd&punc; gives her as Wife to the young Prince his Son, from which instant she is the true and lawful Queen. In the Palace also they order some chaste and vertuous Women to attend her; who being endu'd with all manner of Vertues, instruct her in all Courtly Behavior, that she may justly deserve the Name of a Queen, which they call <HI>Chemu,</HI> that is, <HI>Mother of the Empire.</HI></P>
<P>If we would speak of them according to their Historians, all the Empresses thus brought up, have been Women of great Merits, charitable to the Poor, very Prudent, and of quick Apprehension.</P>
<P>Such a one was the Daughter of a Bricklayer, who being brought to the Dignity of Empress, always kept her Father's Trowel by her; and when the Prince her Son began to grow too ambitious, she shew'd him this Trowel which her Father had us'd, whereby she brought him to Obedience.</P>
<P>The Maidens Relations are immediately advanc'd to high Dignity, and Places of Honor, and her House and Family afterwards accounted Rich, and of great Quality, and the more she wins upon the Emperor's Affection, the higher their Friends are rais'd.</P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="227">The Marrying of the Empero's younger Sons is much after the same manner, only they use not so much care in the choyce of their Wives: but the manner of bestowing their Daughters is several; for they send for twelve young Men of seventeen or eighteen years old, the tallest and handsomest that can be found, to come to the Palace, and set them in a Place where the Princess may see them; whom having view'd, she takes peculiar notice of two; which being shewn to the Emperor, he elects one of them for his Son-in-law.</P>
<P>When the Emperor <HI>Vanlie,</HI> Grandfather to the Emperor <HI>Theumchin,</HI> who Reign'd about <HI>Anno</HI> 40. having two Youths brought before him on the fore|mention'd account, saw one of them very richly Habited, and the other, though comelier, in poor Apparel, ask'd him why he was not so well Habited as his Companion? whereto he answer'd, <HI>O Emperor, the poor Estate of my Father will not permit me to appear in a better Condition:</HI> The Emperor reply'd, <HI>Because you are poor I will take you for my Son-in-law.</HI></P>
<P>The other Youths are sent back again, and accounted Noble, because they were allotted to this Choyce.</P>
<P>The Emperor's Son-in-law hath immediately a <HI>Fumme</HI> set over him, being two Learned <HI>Mandarins</HI> of the Court to be his Tutors, and instruct him in all Princely affairs.</P>
<P>Till the Woman hath Children, the Man is bound to shew Reverence three times a day with bended Knees, but when she is Deliver'd of a Child this Du|ty ceases: Yet there are many Ceremonies and Shews of Obedience that con|tinue; for which reason Persons of Quality shun to be the Emperor's Sons-in|law; and this Custom of chusing twelve is no more observ'd.</P>
<P>Is the Emperor accidentally casts his Eye on a Person of Quality, or a Learned Person, to make him his Son-in-law, they humbly desire and beg to be excus'd of it, fearing to live discontentedly all his life-time, if the Princess should take any dislike against him.</P>
<P>As to what concerns the Emperor's prime Wife, who is call'd by the Title of <HI>Hoamheu,</HI> which is <HI>Empress,</HI> she hath her Seat behind the Emperor: the other six, and the next in Degree, are call'd <HI>Queens,</HI> and in great esteem.</P>
<P>Besides these, the Emperor hath thirty Ladies of Honor, the rest being Con|cubines, to the number of three thousand, are young and beautiful Women, brought thither from all parts of the Empire, whom the Emperor visits at his pleasure, as his Fancy leads, or their Beauty attract.</P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>Theumchim</HI> being a Chaste Man, they said of him, <HI>Pu yu cuin,</HI> that is, <HI>He goes not into the Palaces of Women;</HI> and some others such there have been: as on the contrary, there have been more, whose wandring Affections have been so unsatisfiable, that not pleas'd with their own Fancies to chuse a Mate, they kept a little Wagon, drawn by Goats, letting them run whither they would, and into what Chamber soever they went and stood still, there the Emperor pitch'd for his amorous Dalliance.</P>
<P>Another that would not take that trouble to go into the Womens Palaces, caus'd them all to be presented to him in Pictures, and her whom he lik'd best he sent for. Thus far <HI>Semedo.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Tartar</HI> Emperor which at this day Governs, being a Youth of eighteen Years, hath twelve Empresses for his Service.</P>

<HEAD>Funerals&punc; and Mourning for the Dead.</HEAD>
<P>ALl the <HI>Chinese</HI> Books which Treat of their Customs, endeavor nothing<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">igant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">&punc;</NOTE> more than to incite Children to shew Obedience to their Parents, and Respect to their Ancestors; which they shew in nothing more than in their Fu|nerals and Obsequies: for they not onely Habit themselves in Mourning, but bestow great Cost on a Coffin.</P>
<P>In the preparing for their Funerals, which may rather be call'd a glorious Show, they strive to exceed one another according to their State and Quality; nay, often go beyond their Capacity. They Mourn not in black, but White. The Sons at their Parents Death wear a course Flaxen Coat, or rather Frock, which reaches down to their Feet, their Hats and Shoes are also very pitiful to behold; and they tie a Cord about their Wastes like the <HI>Franciscan</HI> Monks. This Mourning, according to an inviolable Law, for Father or Mother is strictly observ'd by the Children three whole years, for this reason (as they say in their Books,) that they should requite their Parents, and as a testimony of thankfulness that they have carry'd them three years in their Arms, and brought them up with great trouble during their Infancy. But the time which they Mourn for other Relations is much shorter; for some leave off Mourning within the Year, others in three Moneths, as in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The lawful time to Mourn for the Emperor or Empress, is also three years, which all the Subjects observe through the whole Empire: But now upon the Emperor's permission, made known by Proclamation, Days are reckon'd for Moneths, and so the whole Realm in a Moneths time express their Sorrow for the Emperor's Death in Mourning.</P>
<P>The Funeral Ceremonies and Customs of the <HI>Chineses</HI> observ'd at Burials, are written in a large Book, wherefore upon any ones Decease, those that are to take care to Interr the Body repair to that, wherein their Mourning Clothes,
<PB N="374" REF="228">
Shoes, Caps, Girdles, and the like, are not onely describ'd in it, but also re|presented in Pictures.</P>
<P>When a Person of Quality happens to die, the Son of the Deceased, or nearest Kinsman, acquaints all the other Relations and Friends with it by a Book written in a mournful Style. Mean while the Coffin is made, and the Bo|dy put into it, and likewise the Hall or Chamber in which the Corps stands, hung, and cover'd with white Cloth; in the middle of the Chamber is an Al|tar, on which stands the Coffin, and the Effigies of the Deceased.</P>
<P>Into this Chamber on certain Days come all the Kindred of the Deceased clad in Mourning; whither they bring Rice, and setting two Wax-Candles on the Altar, burn Perfumes to the Honor of the Deceased. When the Candles are lighted, then they shew Reverence to the Dead by bowing their Bodies and Kneeling four times: but they first put Frankincense into a Perfuming Pot with Fire, which is plac'd against the Coffin and the fore-mention'd Image. Whilst these Ceremonies are performing, one or more Sons of the Deceased stand on each side of the Chest crying and lamenting; behind the Coffin all the Women of his Alliance, standing behind a Curtain, cry without ceasing. The Priests have ordain'd a Custom to burn Papers, cut after a peculiar fashion, as also white Silk-Stuffs; which is done (they say) that thereby the Deceased may be provided of Clothes in the other World.</P>
<P>The Children oftentimes keep their dead-Fathers and Mothers in a Coffin in the House three or four years together, without the least nauseating smell coming through the Crannies, being colour'd all over with the Gum which they call <HI>Cie.</HI> All which time they set before them every day Meat and Drink as if they were alive.</P>
<P>The Sons during this time of Mourning do not sit on their usual Stools, but on low Benches cover'd with white Cloth; neither do they sleep on Beds, but on Mats of Straw, spread over the Floor near the Coffin. They eat no Flesh, nor drink, but upon pure necessity, not being suffer'd to be at any Feasts, nor for some Moneths to go abroad publickly, but are carry'd in Sedans co|ver'd with Mourning Cloth.</P>
<P>Many other things they observe, which would be too tedious to relate.</P>
<P>At the Day when the Corps is to be carry'd out, the Friends and Relations are invited by another Book, and meet all in white Apparel to attend the Fu|neral; which is perform'd like the <HI>Romans</HI> Processioning; several Shapes of Men, Women, Elephants, Tygers, and Lyons, made of Paper, but curiously Gilt and Painted, being carry'd before, and afterwards burnt at the Grave. The Priests mumbling their <HI>Heathen</HI> Prayers, follow the Corps also in a long Train, and use several Ceremonies by the Way, beating on Drums, playing on Pipes, Cymbals, Bells, and the like. Before go likewise several Men, carrying of great Copper Perfuming-Pots on their Shoulders.</P>
<P>Lastly, the Bier on which the Corps lieth, is brought in great State under an Arch'd Canopy, made very artificially of Wood, and hung with Flannel, which is carry'd by forty, and sometimes by fifty Men.</P>
<P>Behind the Bier follow the Sons on Foot, every one leaning on a Crutch, as if fainting with sorrow. Next follow the Women Kindred in Sedans hung with white Curtains, so that none can see them. The other Women which are not so nearly Ally'd to the Deceased, are also carry'd in Mourning Sedans.</P>
<P>All their Curch-Yards and Tombs are near the City.</P>
<P>If it happen that the Sons at their Parents Deaths are from home, then the Funeral is deferr'd till their Return.</P>
<P><PB N="375" REF="228">Also when a Son is inform'd of his Father's Death, he prepares, if he be a Man of an Estate, a great Feast, to which he invites, and makes mournful Complaints to all his Friends; then returning home with the first opportuni|ty, he renews the same Ceremonies again in order as before; nay, a Son is ob|lig'd by the Law, though he enjoy the greatest Office in the Empire, or be one of the prime Council in <HI>Peking,</HI> or of the <HI>Colaos,</HI> who is the next Person of the Emperor, yet he must come home and spend three years in Mourning, before he is permitted to go again to his former Employment.</P>
<P>But this is onely to be understood for their Parents, and not for any other Relations.</P>
<P>Onely Generals and Magistrates are free from this Law at the Death of their Parents.</P>
<P>If any one die out of his native Countrey, then he who is left to take care of the Corps uses all endeavors, without sparing either Cost or Charges, to carry it home, that there he may be Interr'd in the Grave of his Ancestors; for every Family hath a peculiar Burying place on some Hill in the Suburb of the City. The Sepulchres are large, built of Marble, and adorn'd with several Shapes of Men and Beasts. They also erect great and stately Tomb-stones, on which are Engraven in a noble Style the famous Acts of their Predecessors.</P>
<P>In this manner hath <HI>Trigaut</HI> describ'd their Mourning; but we will also an|nex what <HI>Alvares Semedo, Adrianus de las Cortes,</HI> and <HI>Adam Scall</HI> have written con|cerning the same.</P>
<P>In many things concerning the Life of Man, the <HI>Chineses</HI> agree with the <HI>Euro|pean</HI> Philosophers, but differ much about the Concerns of the Dead. The <HI>Eu|ropeans</HI> make little ado about their Funerals, whereas the <HI>Chineses</HI> esteem no|thing more, and are very careful in their Life-time to give Order to their Children for them, who shew all obedience and dutifulness in performing the same after their Deaths.</P>
<P>It is a general Custom in <HI>China,</HI> not to bury the Dead naked, though a Child of two years old, but put it into a Coffin, according to every ones Capacity; in which the richer sort, notwithstanding the <HI>Chineses</HI> are of a covetous dispo|sition, strive to exceed one another, endeavoring to get the best and sweetest Wood that grows.</P>
<P>Those that have no Children, spare not to give a thousand Crowns for the Wood of a Coffin, though it be nothing near so much worth; which being made and beautifi'd with Ornamentals of Gold, Silver, Painting, Imagery, and the like, is brought home, and oftentimes set in their Chambers to delight them by looking upon it. On the contrary, those which being stricken in years have no Coffins, are always sad and melancholy.</P>
<P>This Custom they generally observe through the whole Empire; and as they receiv'd their Religion from the <HI>Indians,</HI> they have likewise borrow'd many other things of them, imitating them especially in three sorts of Burials, <HI>viz.</HI> in the Earth, in the Water, and in the Fire; for the <HI>Iapanners</HI> will some throw themselves headlong from the tops of Mountains; others tying Stones about their Necks, leap into Rivers; and do many other things to shorten their Lives: But the <HI>Chineses</HI> have not such stout Hearts to bury themselves alive; but poor People, who have not wherewith to purchase a Coffin, burn the Corps, and bury the Ashes.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Suchuen</HI> the Dead are burn'd, and the Ashes gather'd and put into Vessels, and so thrown into the Rivers or Brooks.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="229">Their Coffins are made of hard black Planks, the Seams cover'd with <HI>Iews</HI>-Glue, or Gum, by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call'd <HI>Charan,</HI> or <HI>Giaro,</HI> and by the <HI>Chineses, Cie</HI> and <HI>Cia.</HI></P>
<P>Every one hath his peculiar Place, or Tomb, without the Wall of the City, for they are not permitted within.</P>
<P>Some build handsom Houses there, walling them round, and planting Cy|press, and other Trees, according to the nature of the Soyl.</P>
<P>These Places are valu'd according to the opinion which they have of the Ground; for if a Conjurer hath judg'd it to be lucky to Build on, they ex|ceedingly enhanse the value thereof: nor do they ever buy any Land without the advice of those People.</P>
<P>At their Burials they observe one Order, to put the chief Corps of the Fami|ly at the upper end, and set the other side by side according to their Degrees.</P>
<P>Their Graves are neatly hewn out of Stone, and on the top adorn'd with Shapes of Beasts, as Harts, Elephants, and Lyons, with Encomiastick Inscri|ptions.</P>
<P>Persons of Quality, especially those that are single, bestow more Cost, building stately Palaces and Rooms under Ground like Cells; which are made very convenient to lay the Corps in.</P>
<P>Here all the Relations meet at the time of their Deaths, to do their Offer|ings and other Ceremonies.</P>
<P>For the Poor which have not Money to buy a peculiar Burying-place, there is a common Church-Yard in every City, wherein they lie buried all toge|ther.</P>
<P>They chiefly desire to be buried in their Predecessors Graves, though never so far from the Place where they die, as it often happens to Governors of re|mote Provinces of the Empire, and thither their Friends, to do them the last honor, convey them.</P>
<P>The first Ceremony observ'd at any ones Departure is, that the Sick, when dying, is carry'd on a Mat to give up the Ghost in a Hall: Yet Persons of Quality are not remov'd, but die on their Beds.</P>
<P>When a Father dies, then the eldest Son plucks off his Cap from his Head, and comes with his Hair dishevel'd to the Bed, and tearing the Curtains and Sheets in Pieces, lays them on the Corps; then the Body (if a Male, by Men, if a Female, by Women) is according to their Custom wash'd; which done, they lay it in a Cotton Cloth, or else in Silk, and put on his best Appa|rel; next to the Corps they lay the Badges of his Office, and Degrees of his Learning which he attain'd in his Life-time. The Body thus Garnish'd, is laid in a Coffin, which stands in a Hall hung round about with black. The Effigies of the Deceased drawn to the Life, with his Arms and Livery, are all plac'd at the Head of the Coffin, and at the Feet stands a Table cover'd with a Carpet, before which is a Curtain drawn for the Women to stand behind unseen. The Children and Nephews sit mournfully on Straw. In the first Gallery leading to the Entrance into the Hall, stand several Trumpeters on both sides, and two with Tabers at the Gate of the House in the in-side; before the House in the Street hangs a Bundle of Pieces of Paper made fast to a Stick which reaches down to the Ground, as a sign of their new-begun Mourning, and to give notice to their Neighbors: Afterwards the Children of the Deceased acquaint their nearest Relations and others by a Letter of their Loss; who thereupon come to visit them in this Order: First the Visitant walks into the outer
<PB N="377" REF="229">
Court before the House, and there puts on Mourning, the Drums beating the whilst; which done the Trumpets sounds as he passes through the Gallery: so soon as he enters the Hall the Women behind the Curtain begin to cry, and then approaching the Table he lays a Paper Purse of Money upon it, to defray some of the Charges; after he hath bow'd his Head three or four times on the Corps, and kneel'd down, the Childring lifting him up, place him on their left sides, and shew the same Reverence to him: After all these Ceremo|nies pass'd, every one seats himself without speaking a word.</P>
<P>All those Friends which come thither as Visitants are receiv'd by one of the Deceased's Relations, Clad in a Mourning Garb, who conducts them into an Anti-Chamber, where desiring them to sit, proffers them <HI>Tee,</HI> dry'd Fruit and Sweet-Meats, of which they eating but little, take and put it into their Nets and go away.</P>
<P>These Civilities are so strictly observ'd, that Friends, though they dwell not near, but in some other Cities, come Riding thither; or if it be too far, they send one of their Family to excuse them.</P>
<P>These Ceremonies ended, the eldest Son is oblig'd to go and visit every one in the City, which came to Mourn with him; yet to shun so much trouble he goes onely to their Doors, where leaving a Letter he proceeds to the next. Then they speak of the Funeral if their Purses be able to hold out, if not, they keep the Coffin in the House till the next opportunity, which happens sometimes not in a whole year. At the time appointed all the Friends are advis'd there|of by a <HI>Thu,</HI> or Letter; who when met, go to the House: Before them are carry'd great Images of Men, Horses, Elephants, Lyons, Tygers, and other Beasts, made of Gilt Paper; then follow other Shapes, <HI>viz.</HI> of Wagons, trium|phal Arches, Pyramids, and the like, adorn'd with Silk and Roses of divers colours: all which things are burn'd when the Coffin is put into the Ground, if it be a Person of Quality. These Images are follow'd by great numbers of People that come out of curiosity to see the Funeral: Next walk the Friends all in Mourning, then the <HI>Bonzi</HI> Singing their Prayers, and Taboring on Ba|sons; who are follow'd by a second sort of <HI>Bonzies,</HI> that let their Hair and Beards grow, and play on several sorts of Instruments; these again by a third, that shaving their Hair, differ in their Doctrine from the rest; then come the Acquaintance, and the nearest Relations; the last are the Children and Ne|phews all in close Mourning bare-footed, hanging down their Heads, and car|rying a Stick of two Foot long in their Hands. All this Company walk before the Corps, which is carry'd (if of costly Wood, Gilt and Varnish'd with their <HI>Charan</HI>) uncover'd, on a great Bier, by thirty, forty, or fifty Men, for the greatness of the Funeral consists in the number of Bearers. Behind the Coffin the Women follow Crying, being lock'd up in their Sedans, and cover'd with Mourning. When they are come to the Grave, they use many Ceremo|nies before they put the Corps into the Ground; amongst which one, and none of the least, is a great Feast for all the Company in a stately large House; which done, every one returns home, and observes the time of Mourning and the usual Ceremonies, which are as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>First they Habit themselves in close Mourning, which is all in White, not onely <HI>China,</HI> but also in <HI>Iapan, Corea,</HI> and many other neighboring Countries, though in Reason it cannot be suppos'd, that that Colour was from the begin|ning made for that use, but brought in fashion amongst them onely by Cu|stom, without any other Reason, because the <HI>Chineses</HI> know that White is a
<PB N="378" REF="230">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
joyful Colour, which they also manifest at certain times: but to give our Opinion of it, we must know, that the <HI>Chineses</HI> make all their Stuffs of Cot|ton, and Hemp; Silk and Cotton are much too fine for course Stuffs, therefore they can make use of nothing better than Hemp, for that is naturally of an unpleasing Colour, and therefore they have chose this last for that purpose: and as Hempen Cloth is generally white, it may be believ'd, that White onely was by them chosen to be the Colour of their Mourning.</P>
<P>Three whole years this Sorrow continues, during which time the Children sit onely on little Benches, cover'd with White. They eat not at Tables, nor sleep on a Bedstead, but on a Mat, laid upon the Floor. They also abstain from Wine and Flesh; neither do they go to Baths or Feasts, nor abroad but in a close Mourning Sedan. But that which is more, they never converse (as they say) with their Wives all that time; nor are employ'd in any publick Business of State: and if they have any Employment, though a Vice-Roy or <HI>Colao,</HI> they are forc'd to forsake it to attend the Obsequies, and spend their time in Mourning; which when expir'd, they not onely enjoy their Places again, but are after promoted to higher Dignities. This time they account so holy, that they receive no Pay, though Captains of Companies.</P>
<P>Some years since it hapned, that a Commander of the Province of <HI>Canton,</HI> who was more desirous to follow his Employment than keep the full time of his Mourning, made his Account so, that the time which he spent in his Jour|ney to the Court should be part of his Mourning time, which he wanted to make up the three years: but coming to the Court with intention to enter into his Office again, he was sent back to his House, to spend the remaining time of his Mourning, before he might appear there.</P>
<P>The number of three years is strictly observ'd, for an acknowledgment that the three first years they were carry'd more in their Parents Arms than on their own Legs; wherefore as a sign of Obedience they may not erre from that Order which their Predecessors maintain'd.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="230">The Women Mourn but one year, the near Relations three Moneths, and the Acquaintance three days: And because these accidents often happen, there are few but what have Mourning Coats lying ready by them. Thus far <HI>Semedo.</HI></P>
<P>Father <HI>Adrian de las Cortes,</HI> makes mention of the <HI>Chineses</HI> Mourning for their Parents after this manner, <HI>viz.</HI> The ordinary Mourning Coat, which both Men and Women wear, is very wide, made of course white Hemp, ravel'd and full of Patches. The Sons carry a Cane in their Hands, on which they lean when their Fathers die; but when their Mothers die, a Stick or Truncheon of Wood. On their Heads the Men wear a Bonnet of course Linnen; from whence a great ravel'd Cloth hangs down over their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">aces. The Maids wear a Coif on their Heads of course Linnen; a Girdle of Towe <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">y'd about their Middle hangs down with one end to the Ground.</P>
<P>Their time of Mourning for their Father and Mother is three years, in re|quital (as we said) of their three first years, in which their Parents suckled, and carry'd them in their Arms.</P>
<P>For the Death of Friends they Mourn a longer or shorter time, according to their acquaintance and obligations.</P>

<P>After the Death of either Father or Mother, amongst other Ceremonies which they observe, especially at the Funeral, they have a Custom not to sit on Stools for a certain time, nor sleep on Beds, nor eat Flesh, nor drink Wine, keep from their Wives, speak not aloud, go not out of their Houses, except in Sedans cover'd with course Linnen, and many other things more, till time hath worn away Sorrow.</P>
<P>Except <HI>Militia</HI> Officers, all Persons are oblig'd, though the prime <HI>Colao's,</HI> to forsake their Offices for three years for their Father or Mothers Death, which time they are to spend in Mourning for them. Thus far <HI>De las Cortes.</HI></P>
<P>In this manner the <HI>Chineses</HI> perform their Funerals, or Interr their Dead;
<PB N="380" REF="231">
but the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who at this day Govern the Realm of <HI>China,</HI> observe quite ano|ther manner. The <HI>Iesuit Adam Scall</HI> describes them both in the following words:</P>
<P>Both <HI>Tartars</HI> and <HI>Chineses</HI> (saith he) take a peculiar care for the burying of their Dead; for they imagine that all the happiness of their Successors de|depends upon it: wherefore they often lay by three, four, five hundred, nay a thousand Crowns in their life-time to be bestowed on their Graves: To which purpose they also gather Planks of Cedar, and other like lasting Woods, which they send for two or three hundred Leagues off, to make them Coffins, wherein they may for ever, as they suppose, lie secure; which the <HI>Iesuit Martinius</HI> testifies in these words:</P>
<P>It is (saith he) by them accounted a great happiness for him, who before his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Histor. Sinens. lib. 5.</NOTE> Death makes himself a Coffin of the best and strongest Wood, some of which costs sometimes two thousand Crowns; for they send for the most du|rable and best Wood out of remote Countreys, so that there is no City but there are Coffins to be sold in it, nay most People buy them before their Deaths, and keep them in their Houses.</P>
<P>The upper Planks (saith <HI>Scall</HI>) of the <HI>Tartars</HI> Coffins are sloaping like a Roof, and Painted on the out-side, not regarding the thickness of the Planks, because they put their Coffins to no other use, than to hold the Body for a short time, and carry them out in; for coming to their Funeral Piles, they burn the Coffins with the Corps. But those of the <HI>Chineses</HI> are narrower at the Feet, and broader and higher at the Head, the upper Plank smooth, and reaching over the sides, that the thickness thereof may be seen, which is chiefly observ'd and taken no|tice of. They are very careful to chuse a Burying-place; for if they have not Land of their own, then they purchase it at a great Rate. Those Places are principally made choice of in a dry Soyl, where no Rivers nor High-ways are near, nor any Temples or Towers, but must be on a Plain, which neither rises before nor behind. Such a Place being chosen, they surround it with a Bank of Earth lik a Half-Moon, which rises in the Middle, and runs sloaping down on both sides, yet not smooth but scollope-like; at the upper end of which they bury the eldest, and below him on each side the Sons and Nephews, not in one Grave, but every one apart under a little Hillock, and the chief of the Fa|mily under the highest Hill: In the middle on a Stone Table are plac'd variety of Provisions, Perfumes, and other things, in honor of the Deceased.</P>
<P>Any one that amongst a Family is rais'd to a higher degree of Honor than his Predecessors, erects his own Tomb in his life-time; whereon they Carve the Shapes of Men or Beasts, according to every Mans Quality and Estate, Planting the remaining part of the Ground with Cedar Trees, and Wall'd round.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> differ herein; for though they, according to the conveniency and Place, require the same things as the <HI>Chineses,</HI> yet they observe not the same manner in their Burial; for the old People are buried apart, and the younger by themselves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> also erect a Tomb-stone, on which is Engraven the Age of the Deceased, his Office, and the Emperor's Favors to him: and to prevent the Characters from being defaced, and the remembrance of the Deceased's Exploits from being worn out; besides the Tomb-stone they bury another square Stone in the Ground with the same Inscription, that when the first is worn out, that may appear perfect, and serve as a Memorial of all his Atchievements.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="231">When any one dies, whoe're he be, all the Friends and Relations come about the Corps, crying and Mourning over it.</P>
<P>Persons of Quality send a piece of very thin white Linnen, with a Letter to their Friends, to acquaint them of the dead Corps, who at an appointed day come thither, bringing with them Perfumes, Wax-Candles, and Money; coming into the House they go to a Table, plac'd opposite to the Coffin in the midst of the Hall; having set fire on the Perfumes that stand upon the Table, they step a little backwardand shew Reverence to the Effigies of the Deceased, Painted at the Head of the Coffin, by kneeling four times, and bowing their Heads to the Ground, whilst they make a mournful Cry.</P>
<P>These Ceremonies being perform'd, the nearest Relations appear also on one side of the Coffin between the Curtains; and coming forth shew the same Reverence, also kneeling, and bowing their Heads four times to the Ground. The time of Visiting ended, the nearest Kindred come the next day into the House of Mourning, from whence they convey the Corps to the Grave, or at least to the City Gates; for which Kindness the Children go from House to House in Sack-Cloth, and with their Faces looking down on the Ground, re|turn Thanks, by shewing Reverence to their Visitants, who on purpose stand at their Doors.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Tartars</HI> observe quite another way of Interring their Dead, <HI>viz.</HI> on the same day that any one dies, the Corps being put in a Coffin, and the Friends having Wept over it in the House, they carry it away, except the Deceas'd was a Vice-Roy or Governor.</P>
<P>The Relations accompany the Hearse, and afterwards placing themselves in Rows, on each side of the Funeral Pyre; those of her Family set fire of the Wood, and so burn the Body, whose Ashes on the third day are gather'd, and put into a <HI>Porcelane</HI> Urn, to be bury'd.</P>
<P>Yet far greater Honor is shown to the Vice-Roys, whether <HI>Tartars</HI> or <HI>Chi|neses,</HI> for when a <HI>Tartar</HI> King dies, his Servants, after some formal Lamentati|ons, are plac'd on each side of the Court-Gate, that they may be seen, holding his Atchievements; for some have Helmets, others Bonnets, those Girdles, others again Swords, Belts, Bowes, Quivers, and other like things in which he delighted. Thus order'd, they make a continual doleful noise all the time of their standing there.</P>
<P>In the same Order his Horses stand to be seen, held by his Grooms, with rich Saddles, and Caparisons of Velvet.</P>
<P>There stand also Camels handsomly Harnes'd, and loaden with the Goods that are to be us'd at the Funeral, and by them, under the Gates Drummers and Trumpeters.</P>
<P>At the appointed day the Corps is carry'd out, before which ride Trumpeters Sounding mournfully, then follow twenty or thirty choice Camels, with Silk Bridles and Saddels hanging at their Necks, and loaden with Tents and other Furniture, to be carry'd to the Grave; next follow such as bear Silk Umbrella's, and Painted and Gilded Fans; then Ensigns, Flags, Pennons, and the like, with Silver Chargers; after those, richly Caparison'd Horses, laden with his best Houshold-stuff, and led by Grooms; and lastly, the Sedans which the Vice-Roy us'd.</P>
<P>The place of Burial is encompass'd with a Mat in stead of a Wall, within whose Inclosure stand Tents, furnish'd with rich Goods, to be burnt. In the middle appears a great Hall, also made of Mats, to put the body in: Those
<PB N="382" REF="232">
that were the last that attended the Train, appear by this Hall first, and behind them stand the rest, each, according to their Qualities: The remaining vacan|cy within this Inclosure, and behind the Hall, being for the Women: When they are all within, standing for a considerable time, they make a hideous noise, more like howling than weeping; which done, and all things ready for the Offering, the Priests, or other Persons appointed, Garnishing Tables with Fruits and Preserves, and Meat in great Silver Chargers, they deliver a Cup with Wine to the chiefest Vice-Roy there present, who holds it up three times as an Offering to the Deceas'd.</P>
<P>Mean while, a Letter of Recommendation from the Emperor is produc'd, wherein the Merits of the Deceas'd are set forth, and he Honor'd with a Noble Title.</P>
<P>The chiefest of the present Councellors, having read this Letter with a loud Voice, throws it into the fire and burns it; so bowing their Heads three times, they rise again, and begin to cry: Then those of his Family set fire on a Pa|per Mountain, cover'd all over with Purple Flannel, into which they throw the richest Clothes, Hats, Saddles, Gold and Silver Vessels, Sedans and Beds of the Deceas'd, which being consum'd, they gather the melted Gold and Silver, and putting it into Paper, on the third day throw it into the fire again, adding to it other Riches, till all be burnt: The Horses bereav'd o their Caparisons, are let loose, and bought by those that please for half their worth.</P>
<P>This done, all the Invited depart, being conducted by one of the Vice-Roy's, out at the Gate, where he thanks them.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Tartars</HI> are not satisfi'd with this one Funeral, for seven days after they renew it again, and a third time seven days after that, till all things be consum'd that the Deceas'd lov'd and esteem'd.</P>
<P>Moreover, if the Deceas'd had a more than ordinary belov'd Concubine, or Prime Favorite, they murther themselves; for the Concubine, whether willing or unwilling, is forc'd to Hang her self, to comfort, delight, and accompany (as these ignorant People say) the Deceas'd in the other World: Yet the more understanding Persons, being somewhat better instructed, have of late, dread|ing such horrid Murthers, Petition'd the Emperor, by his Proclamation, to forbid such Cruelties; and likewise the wasting and burning of Houshold-stuff, and other Materials, which his Imperial Majesty hath accordingly Order'd, so that in stead of rich Cloth of Tissue, they only burn Gilded Paper, and have in a manner left off the Barbarous Custom of killing themselves at the Grave.</P>
<P>Having ended their Offerings, and crying a second or third time in the pre|sence of all those that are afresh come to the Funeral-Pyre; they erect a Hall or Court, being the Tomb, (as if for a live Person) surrounding it with Walls, along whose sides are several Apartments, after the same manner, like those in which the Deceas'd in his life time recreated himself; in these they place the faithfullest Servants: In the middle thereof, they make the Tomb of Bricks, on a square Mount, round about which they place the Cushions and Sedans of the Deceas'd, on the Walls on each side hang his Girdle, Sword, Belt, a Quiver full of Arrows, and a Bowe: In this Hall, for a whole year, they bring Meat every day, which they put at the Foot of the Mount for the Deceas'd, as if he were to feed upon it, whilst those that bring it, stand on one side crying. These are for the Great Ones; but the <HI>Tartars</HI> of meaner quality, wanting Estates, build no Hall over their Graves, but placing only Meat, or <HI>Tee</HI> near the same, go away again.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="232">The <HI>Chineses</HI> on the contrary, after their Friends and Relations are met, and having shewn the usual Reverence to the Deceas'd, go out of the House in this Order: Before on a long Stick is carry'd a Red Silk Cloth, whereon is written the Name, Titles, Age, and Quality of the Deceas'd, in Silver Chara|cters; then follow a great number of Children, who carry all manner of Flowers, made of colour'd Paper, upon Canes, besides Representations of Men, Beasts, Gardens, Houses, and the like, Painted on Paper to delight the Eye: If the Deceas'd in his life time was famous for his Zeal in Religion, then his Images (curiously Painted) are born before him; after which comes next in order the Effigies of the Deceas'd, on a rich Bier, follow'd by the <HI>Bonzues,</HI> Play|ing on Tabers, Cymbals, and other Instruments; then Anticks and Stage|players come Riding on Horse-back, in the same Habits they are to Act in at the Grave, and all the way as they pass, shewing Tricks and using other Mi|mick Gestures: The Orphans walk just behind the Corps, leaning on Sticks, and supported under their Arms by their Servants, as if excess of sorrow had thus weaken'd them: The Bier on which the Corps stands, cover'd with rich Silk Clothes, is carry'd by eight, sixteen, nay sometimes thirty two Bearers. When they come to the Grave, those that have attended the Funerals, throw what they have carry'd on a heap of Paper, which setting on fire, they go to the Tables that stand before the Corps, Garnish'd with several Fruits and Per|fumes, besides a scalded Hogg and Lamb at each end; then three or four of the Eminentest set fire of the Perfumes before the whole company. Lastly, They step aside and make room for him who is to write on a Board made before, being three Fingers broad, and an Ell long, the Name and Quality of the De|ceas'd, first they set down this Mark <GAP DESC="foreign">, which signifies <HI>Emperor;</HI> and for this cause they that are to do this, must be clad in such Apparel, as any of Qua|lity might appear in before the Emperor. This Person with the Pencil in his Hand, craves pardon of all the Spectators, for his bold attempt, excusing his unworthiness of that Office; then he writes over the first Mark, on the upper end of the Board with black Ink, another in this manner <GAP DESC="foreign"> for then that which signifi'd <HI>Emperor</HI> is chang'd, and is as much as <HI>Lord;</HI> so that in this man|ner, with the first under written Name of the Deceas'd, a full Sentence is made, <HI>viz. The Lord N. N.</HI> This Board the Deceased's Friends carry with his Image to his House, that it may be yearly Worship'd and remember'd by his Predecessors. So soon as this Inscription is finish'd, the Writer goes by them all, having Bow'd and Kneel'd four times: But before the Friends depart, they are either entertain'd in a House, rais'd of Mats, or in the next Chappel, at a Noble Treat, at which the first Cup is given to the Children, as they say, to wipe off their Tears. At their return home, some <HI>Tausus</HI> or Conjurers come to the Mourning House, that by the sprinkling of certain Water, they may drive away (as they say) evil Spirits, and bring Peace and Quiet to the House.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> use one Colour, but not one Fashion for their Mourning.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Tartars,</HI> both Friends and Relations, wear a long Coat of Sack-Cloth, reaching down to their Feet, and gird it about their Middle with a Hempen Cord; they put on their oldest Buskins, and worst Hats, without the red Silk-Fringe, which at other times they wear for an Ornament.</P>
<P>The Hair of their Head or Beard is not shaven in all that time.</P>
<P>After the expiration of a Moneth, every one throws in a fire of Paper, and other such like Materials, their Mourning Girdle, with which they judge their
<PB N="384" REF="233">
Mourning to be ended, and Habit themselves again in their usual Apparel.</P>
<P>Neighbors and acquaintance shew that they Mourn by pulling their Silk Fringe from their Hats.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartar</HI> Women, in the time of Mourning, change their Apparel, being usually Black, into White; their Coifs, which else are cover'd with their Hair, resemble a White Cap, with Tassels that hang over their Shoulders.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> Mourning alters yearly, their first year, both Men and Wo|men wear all over their Bodies a Sute of Sack-Cloth full of holes, with Shooes of White Cloth, and a Rope about their Wastes, seeming thus by the careles|ness of their Garb, to express their sorrow for the Death of their Parents. The second year their Habit is made of sleight Cloth, their Hat of the usual Fashi|on, but of another Colour, their Shooes handsomer, and their Girdles of Hemp left off. The third year they may wear Silk Clothes, and their Hats of the same Stuff, but White, or else of the usual Colour, which is generally Black.</P>
<P>In this time they follow no imployment, though of the greatest concern, nor may sit opposite to or by the Visitants, as others, but on a low Bench.</P>
<P>In the first Months, they not only abstain (as is usual in Fastings) from Flesh, Fish, Milk, Wine, and the like, but eat very unsavory things, neither season'd with Salt nor Herbs: And as the time of Mourning for a Wife, Bro|ther, more distant Relations or Friends is much shorter, so is also their Apparel and Meat better.</P>
<P>The Childrens Mourning for their Parents is three year, which time the Wife must observe for the death of her Husband; the eldest Son, or his Wife, is by his Parents Mourn'd for a year, and as long a time the Man Mourns for his Wife, and one Brother for another.</P>
<P>This long time of Mourning, observ'd by the Children, for the Death of<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Histor. Sin.</HI> l. 1. c. 23.</NOTE> their Parents, hath (as <HI>Martinius</HI> tell us) been observ'd by the <HI>Chineses</HI> ever since the Emperor <HI>Xun</HI>'s time, who Mourn'd for&punc; his Predecessor <HI>Ya,</HI> being his Fa|ther, three whole years at his Grave, without stirring thence, and intrusting the care of his Realm (during that time) to his Vice-Roys; and as the same <HI>Mar|tinius</HI> adds, from thence it is, that they Mourn in that manner for their Pa|rents, always staying in their Houses, laying down all Offices, changing their Meat and Furniture to meaner, and always sitting on a low Bench; upon this account also they drink no Wine, but live only on Pot-Herbs: Their Clothes are very Fantastick, made of Sack-Cloth; their Lodging Rooms meaner, nay, they frame their manner of speaking to a much more sorrowful Tone, and whereas before they us'd to write with Red on Paper streak'd with Vermilion, now they use only Yellow or Blue Colours, as a token of their Sorrow.</P>
<P>It is very strange to observe the Duty and Reverence which the Children shew to their Dead Parents, wherein no other People may be compar'd to them, for many (though Magistrates) when observing that their Parents be|ing grown very old, have need of their help, they desire the Emperor to ex|cuse them from their Office, without urging any thing, but that according to their Duty they may go to assist their aged Father, which the Emperor seldom refuses.</P>
<P>As to what concerns their Mourning three years, the <HI>Chinese</HI> Philosophers give this reason, That it is most fit, those which in their first three years have receiv'd their Parents Love, should spend so much time after their Death in Mourning and bewailing their loss; therefore it is no marvel, that the <HI>Chineses</HI> count it the greatest misfortune in the world to have no Children, because they
<PB N="385" REF="233">
know that no body will look after them in their Age, nor at their Death Mourn for them.</P>
<P>The reasons why they make White to be Mourning, and not Black, is, as themselves say, because White is Natural, when as all other things are Dy'd, or Artificial; by which, as they say, is signifi'd, that in Sorrow, neither Art nor Pride must be shewn, for where a true Sorrow is, Nature sufficiently ex|presses it. Thus far <HI>Martinius.</HI></P>
<P>With great preparation and Pomp the Emperor <HI>Zungte,</HI> Father to this pre|sent Emperor <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Adam Schall.</NOTE> was Interr'd.</P>
<P>The next day being the eighth of their first Moon, after the Emperor's Death, his Corps was put into the Coffin about Noon: There was not one <HI>Tartar</HI> in all <HI>Peking</HI> that serv'd in publick Affairs, but he went thither with his Wife and Daughters, which so throng'd the Courts, that none were able to get thorow: The eldest were receiv'd into the first Court, next the Emperor's Lodging, where they all together bewail'd his Death, with many loud Shreeks and Cries; in which (to admiration) they obse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e an exact time, with stops and pauses, as in Musick.</P>
<P>After all, the <HI>Tartars</HI> divided into eight Companies, let into the Emperor's Hall by two and two, there bewail'd his Death, they went away, and made room for others, so that the Cry continu'd without any cessation, the Multi|tudes still going out, and coming in.</P>
<P>Mean while, there were not a few that fasted three days, not daring to go out of the Gates, nor their Servants suffer'd to bring them any Refreshment.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Iohn Adam Schall</HI> at that time present, there taking compassion of the People, which were ready to perish for Hunger and Thirst, Petition'd the Go|vernors, either to furnish them with Provisions on the publick Account, or else set the Multitude return home; alledging, that there were Women amongst them, and that their weak Sex was not able to endure such Inconveniencies, and likewise ancient People, that worn out with sicknesses, were not us'd to undergo such hardship.</P>
<P>No sooner was <HI>Schal</HI>'s Petition deliver'd, but the Governors looking upon his Request to be just, let all the People go away, with resolution, that all the <HI>Mandarins</HI> should every Morning for the seven following days, Weep half an hour in the Emperor's Chamber; after which, every one should retire and ob|serve the establish'd Month of Fasting for the Emperor.</P>
<P>The fourteenth of the first new Moon, they gave the new Emperor <HI>Konchi</HI> his Oath, at the performance whereof, every Bench were in particular led into a Hall.</P>
<P>The chief of the first and second Order went to the upper Hall, where ha|ving with the rest lamented over the Deceas'd Emperor's Body, the Oath was publickly read before them all; to which they all shew'd Reverence by thrice Kneeling and bowing their Heads to the Ground, and calling upon the Dead to witness the same.</P>
<P>Then going from the Court, they went to an Idol-Temple, where they gave him the Oath again, and finish'd their began Work with the same Ceremonies.</P>
<P>When on the seventh day, after the Emperor's Death, the sleight Roofs made of Mats were taken away, the chief Funeral-Priest seated himself in the open Court; after which, the chiefest being call'd into the Hall, and the rest stand|ing at the Door, they began again to Cry, which dured longer than ordinary, because the Queen-Mother was there present, and began first with all her Wo|men.
<PB N="386" REF="234">
Then many Silver and Gold Vessels were brought out of a Tent erected for the Corps; and Tables being also set about the Coffin, richly Garnish'd with Sweet-meats in Silver Chargers, all which was thrown into the Fire. The remaining time, as from the first day when they went to lament, the City Ser|vants and petty Governors holding all that had belong'd to the Emperor, as his Horses, Atchievements, Flags, and other things of State, stood in a Row at the Entrance of the Palace, from whence they stirr'd not till the <HI>Mandarins</HI> went away. On the first of the second Moon the Crying and fore-mention'd Ce|remonies were again renew'd, early in the Morning in the presence of the Queen-Mother, and the Tables, which four Men could scarce carry, were again with Clothes, Carpets, and the like, thrown into the Fire. The last day they met to accompany the Corps, which was plac'd behind the Palace in a Hall on a neighboring Mount, which abounds with Deer, Harts, Stags, and the like Beasts for the Emperor's Recreations, till the Imperial Tomb should be made ready in some other Place. First the Way, which from the Palace runs to the Mount, was Grabell'd and laid plain, to prevent the rising of the Dust, to which inconvenience the Streets in <HI>Peking</HI> are very subject. Thither came all the Grandees Habited in white Mourning, to accompany the Corps; before went nine Elephants with Turrets on their Backs; forty Camels, capa|rison'd with red Cloths and Bridles plated with Gold, and rich Symiters hang|ing down by their Necks, were loaden with Tents and other Furniture: then follow'd an hundred Horses, led by yellow Bridles, without Gold, except the Buckles, which were onely Gilded: next in order were Drums, Trumpets, and others with Instrumental Musick to the number of a hundred; behind which were carry'd fifty Gilded Hammers, and above an hundred Flags of several colours, with wild Beasts, Birds, and twenty eight Stars, stitch'd with Thr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of Gold; then again fifty Hammers, after which were led a hundred Saddled Horses, the last thirty laden with rich Flannel, and the Emperor's Clothes con|demn'd to the Fire; next these came twenty Youths, every one holding an Im|perial Quiver, imboss'd with Pearls and Precious Stones, besides Bowes and Ar|rows, and just before them walk'd twelve Greyhounds; behind these came the Emperor's Sedan, born by sixteen Men, in which when living he us'd to be carry'd, richly Gilt, and on the top adorn'd with a Golden Ball; the Bearers were clad in a Livery of a Saffron colour, Embroider'd with Roses of Gold&punc; next them were carry'd several Gold and Silver Chargers; behind which fol|low'd the Bier with the Emperor's Corps, cover'd with Cloth of Tissue, Em|broider'd with blue Clouds and Flowers, supported by thirty two Bearers, all in a Saffron-colour'd Livery, and adorn'd with Golden Roses; behind the Corps came Soldiers with Pikes and other Arms; then the Emperor's Mother in a Sedan cover'd with Purple-Silk; next hers, seven more cover'd with white Cotton, in every one of which was a Queen, or Concubine of the Emperor's; then follow'd many Grandees on Foot; lastly, all the Magistrates, and those that shew'd Reverence by kneeling and bowing to the Corps as it pass'd by, follow'd disorderly one among another to the Grave, which was inviron'd with a Wall, but the multitude pulling it down, quickly made room for all comers.</P>
<P>The Governors of the first Degree going into the base Court before the Hall, where the Bearers had set down the Corps, stood and cry'd all together, as likewise those that stood about them; at length one of the chiefest Vice-Roys lifting up a Golden Cup with Wine three times, they all bow'd their Heads
<PB N="387" REF="234">
down to the Ground: then the Vice-Roy offer'd the fore-mention'd Cup as an Oblation: Before the Corps stood a Table strow'd full of Silver and Gold Flowers, and all sorts of Perfumes: Then they began again to cry till they all went away, leaving the rest of the Ceremonies to be perform'd the next Morning. At every Gate the chief Vice-Roy Offer'd before the Coffin a Cup with Wine, which he lifted up three times as before, and then deliver'd it to a prime Councellor, who put it aside to be Offer'd again at last with the rest.</P>
<P>The next Morning, being the twenty seventh day after the Emperor's Death, they all met again by the Corps, and every one standing in their ap|pointed Places began their general Lamentation. Having perform'd all Ce|remonies as on the day before, the Letter given by the Emperor to his Son, containing the Praise due to the Deceased, was publickly read; whereupon the Magistrates doubling their Shreeks and Cries, return'd into the base Court, whilst four of the chiefest Persons of Quality going to the <HI>Paper Mountain,</HI> co|ver'd with yellow Silk, carry'd in an open Cloth, a Sable Sute of the deceased Emperor, with his Hat rais'd on the Crown with Pearls and Diamonds, and likewise a Sable Quilt whereon to lay his Head. Others in ten Carpets bore ten several Sutes more of the Emperor's; and Saddles and Caparisons for Horses were also laid on the Heap, besides Flags, Fans, Gold Plates, and the Emperor's Sedan; all which being brought to the Heap of Paper, cover'd with yellow Silk, they set on fire, and threw in the Tables full of Flannel Clothes, many Gold and Silver Vessels, which being melted stream'd down the Hill like a Rivulet. Then the Governors unty'd their Girdles, which being of white Cloth, they had fastned about their Middle, and so throwing them into the Flame they were released of their Mourning. Lastly, they pull'd off all their Mourning Habit, and leaving it there went home.</P>
<P>Three days after the prime Governors of the first Order came thither with the <HI>Tartars</HI> (the <HI>Chineses</HI> being lockt out) and prepar'd a new Funeral, at which they us'd the same Ceremonies, carrying Fans, and leading Horses and Cam|mels. The same four Grandees brought another Sute of the Emperor's, and a Hat, having onely one great Pearl on the Crown, which they, as before, threw on Paper Heaps, and likewise some Saddles beset with Pearls and Diamonds, which done every one returned home.</P>
<P>All these Ceremonies are renew'd from day to day till the hundredth day; during which time no Musick may be heard, nor any Plays acted through all the City; and they continue mourning after the hundredth, for the <HI>Tartars</HI> watch by the Coffin continually.</P>
<P>After the expiration of two years, when the time was come to carry the Corps to the appointed Grave, twenty four Leagues from the City of <HI>Peking,</HI> all the <HI>Mandarins</HI> conducted the Corps on Foot out of the City, where they took leave of it on their bended Knees.</P>
<P><HI>Zungte</HI> the Emperor of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Tartary,</HI> made some years since a very great<NOTE PLACE="marg">Adam Scall.</NOTE> Funeral for one of his Concubines which was after this manner:</P>
<P>He accompanied the Corps in Person out of his Palace Gates, where the Body was laid in State till the expiration of a hundred days, at the end of which to be burnt, and by his Order to have Offerings made for it every fourth day; the Materials for which, besides the other Preparations, cost the Emperor above ten thousand <HI>Ducats.</HI> Amongst other wasteful Ceremonies he caus'd all the Ta|bles, with their Silken Cloths to be thrown into the Fire. The Bier followd, as we said, before, by the Emperor, was cover'd with Velvet; before it were

carry'd three Sedans, seeming to be all Gold, though onely Gilt, which being beset with Precious Stones, made a glorious show; before the Sedans went three Wains drawn by Horses, which being cover'd on the top, were also richly Gilded: thousands of People made daily a great Cry, and the rest of the Ceremonies were all like the fore-mention'd, in which, they say, was spent eight hundred thousand <HI>Ducats.</HI></P>
<P>With a peculiar magnificence and splendor was formerly solemniz'd the Funeral of a <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperor and Empress. <HI>Semedo</HI> describes that of the Em|press, Mother to the Emperor <HI>Vanlie,</HI> who deceased <HI>Anno</HI> 1614. on the last of <HI>May,</HI> in the following words:</P>
<P>IMmediately after the Death of the Empress, the Court and City, as well Noble-men as Burgesses, Habited themselves in Mourning, and chiefly the Empresses Officers left off the Badges of their Offices and put on Mourning, wearing a Hempen Cord in stead of a rich Girdle&punc; for a black Silk Hat, one of <HI>Chinese</HI> Cloth. In this manner they went four Moneths till the day of the Funeral; but the common People wore onely a Mourning Hat for the space of twenty four days; which was so strictly observ'd, that none upon pain of being severely punish'd durst leave them off. The second day the Emperor went out of his Palace into that of his deceased Mother, which lay a little di|stant, yet inclos'd within the same. Before the Corps was Dress'd in white Linnen, and put into the Coffin, the Emperor came every day in Person with his Attendants to visit and shew Reverence to it in the same manner as all Children do to their Parents, and Offering to her the most odoriferous Per|fumes. The same Ceremonies were also strictly observ'd by all the Emperor's Wives and Concubines, Children, Nephews, and prime Persons of his Palace. The Emperor also commanded that the Deceased's Apparel, Beds and Furni|ture should be burnt, judging it to be a disgrace to suffer any Person of a lower Degree to make use of them. The third day the Empress was laid in the Chest wherein she was to be bury'd. The Chest, or Coffin being very large, and of thick Boards, was made of the best and most costly Wood that could be got in the whole Empire, and made fast with Silver Plates and Handles in form of Dragons: the Boards, neither Painted nor Gilt, were curiously rubb'd, the Cover onely Plated with Gold. The Emperor himself laid out the Body on a Quilt with a Pillow made for that purpose, and threw an unvalua|ble Treasure of Pearls and Precious Stones upon it, and plac'd fifty Pieces of Gold, and fifty Pieces of Silver Cloth on each side thereof. This being done, and the Coffin lockt up, the Emperor and his Attendants shew'd Reverence again to the Corps. The fourth day renewing their Ceremonies, they put on their Mourning Apparel; at which time the Coffin stood in a large Court on a rais'd Ascent, in a manner like a Throne, with fifteen Tables about it; the first stood before the Emperor, the rest before his Women, Children, and chiefest Allies, which all in their Qualities after the Emperor Offer'd Perfumes. The fifth day was order'd foe those that were without; first all the Nobility, or Gentry, call'd <HI>Que Cum Chu Cheu Heupi,</HI> Habited in their honorable Robes, came to the Palace; after them all the Empresses Favorites, <HI>viz.</HI> those that were Marry'd to her Daughters or Neeces; and lastly the <HI>Mandarins</HI> of the six Courts of Judicature, whose Authority extends through the whole Empire, every one Cloth'd according to his Quality, and what suted his Employment' Military or Civil. All these shew'd Reverence to the Corps in the same man|ner

<P>This Order is expresly given to all <HI>Mandarins,</HI> as well those that are in Of|fice as others, whether Civil or Military. It is likewise Order'd, that the Burgesses shall wear a Mourning Hat for the space of thirty days. They also forbid that any Instruments should be touch'd, either in the <HI>Mandarins</HI> Palaces or Houses, or in any Place wherein Travellers are Lodg'd upon the Empe|ror's Charge. This was proclaim'd by certain <HI>Mandarins</HI> that follow no other Employment.</P>
<P>After all these Ceremonies before the Funeral, the great Magician at the Court in <HI>Peking,</HI> was commanded to chuse the Days wherein the remaining
<PB N="390" REF="238">
Funeral Pomp was to be solemniz'd. After much study and care he pitch'd upon the ninth day of the sixth Moon, being four Moneths after the Empresses Death, for the Coffin to be carry'd out of the Palace, and the fifteenth of the same Moneth to the Grave. The time being come, the following Order was publish'd, to be observ'd at the Funeral.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>I.</HI> That all the Mandarins of the Court should with the chief Councellors, six days be|fore go out of their Houses into their several Chambers at Court, and there fast three days, as is before mention'd.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>II.</HI> That the Receivers of the Emperor's Revenues should prepare all Ne&ccedil;essaries, as Torches, Perfumes, Images of Men, Horses, Lyons, Elephants, Silk Umbrella's, and other Ornamentals, to be burnt at the Grave: <HI>The Charge whereof was said to amount to thirty thousand</HI> Escu's.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>III.</HI> That the Lords of the Council <HI>Hanlim</HI> should make new Funeral Elegies.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>IV.</HI> Because the Emperor intending to accompany the Corps to the Grave about seven Leagues from the Palace, happen'd to be somewhat indispos'd, he would send a Grand Courtier in his stead, to perform that necessary Duty.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>V.</HI> The Martial Officers must keep Watch in the City, and by the Grave, and also to guard the Corps thither.
<P><HI>At every Gate of the City (which were nine) stood a thousand Armed Men, from the Place where the Corps lay to the Grave, the way on both sides was Guarded by Soldiers. Three thousand conducted the Body, and forty thou|sand were chosen to Watch by the Grave during the whole time of the Funeral Ceremonies.</HI></P></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>VI.</HI> All the Streets from the Palace to the Grave must be Rail'd in, that there may be a free Passage on each side to prevent crowding; and likewise at the end of every twenty Paces must stand Baskets with yellow Sand, to damp the Dust from rising in those Places through which the Corps was to be carry'd, besides Tents and Pavilions for the convenience of those that follow'd the Horse.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>VII.</HI> The Commanders of the Treasury had Order to provide Money to pay the <HI>Manda|rins,</HI> Relations, Commanders, Soldiers, and all those that attended the Funeral.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>VIII.</HI> That three days before the Burial they should renew their Mourning, shewing Reverence, and making Offerings as they had done at the beginning.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>All things thus prepar'd, the Emperor and the Prince his Son, went with all his Officers to the Temple of their Predecessors, which is in the Imperial Pa|lace, where the Emperor in close Mourning shew'd Reverence to the first raiser of his Family, and Offer'd many Silk Coats and Wine to the Deceased. Then he caus'd a Book to be read, which had been written in the praise of them; which being with many other Ceremonies perform'd, they return'd to the Palace, whilst by the Emperor's Order, Coats and other Ornamentals were thrown into the Fire and burnt.</P>
<P>During the eight days which were yet remaining they Offer'd to the Hea|vens, Earth, Planets, Mountains and Streams. Then Reverence was also shewn by the Emperor's Order to the Spiritual Protectors of the nine Palace Gates, through which the Corps was to be carry'd. The like also was done to the six Bridges of the River which runs before the Palace, Offering at all those Places Beasts, Wine, and Perfumes.</P>
<P>The Coffin with the Corps was plac'd on a triumphal Arch, richly wrought and hung with Silk, interwoven with Gold, and in many places Plated with Gold, Engraven with Lyons, Dragons, and the like; about it stood a great many Torches, and Vessels with Perfumes. The fifth day appointed by the
<PB N="391" REF="238">
Magician to carry out the Corps, the Emperor appear'd, with his Wives, Chil|dren, and Allies, at the Place where the Chariot stood. Having cry'd for the Deceased, he Offer'd to their God of the Spirits so to conduct her, that she might have a happy Journey to the Enjoyments of Peace and Quietness. Those that were commanded to attend the Corps in the Name and Place of the Emperor, and to make Offerings at the appointed Places, were all in a readiness under the first Gate, where they no sooner receiv'd the Herse, but they began to walk in such a handsom Order, State, and Silence, as was wonderful to be|hold: Getting that day no farther than without the Walls, where stopping at the appointed Place they put the Corps under a Pavilion, made Offerings on Tables plac'd for that purpose, burnt Perfumes, and perform'd all other Cere|monies; which no sooner done, but a Messenger was sent to the Emperor, to inform him that they were got thither and had perform'd their Duties. The following day they began with those Ceremonies with which they had ended the last Night, and then proceeded on their Journey, which lasted thirteen days, because of the Offerings and stops which they made by the Way to the Mount, where the Emperors Tombs are. The concourse of People from all Places was so great, that they were past number. When the whole Train was come thither, the Corps was taken off from the Chariot, and plac'd upon another stately and triumphal one, no less costly than the first. Then they offer'd a Steer, which they sprinkled with Wine, besides Coats and Perfumes, to the honor of the Earth, with Prayers to the God of the Spirits, that he would receive the Corps. At the same time nine <HI>Mandarins,</HI> sent from the Emperor, observ'd the like Ceremonies, and Offer'd to all the Emperor's Predecessors that lay in that Place. On the Funeral day, being the fifteenth day of the sixth Moon, they made several Offerings to conclude their Ceremonies; of which, and what they had done by the Way, they gave an Account to the Emperor, who shew'd his bounty to those that had been careful in the observing of them, and ex|press'd his Affection to his Mother in shewing Reverence to her after her Death, and for her sake released all Prisoners that had committed but small Crimes. It was also Order'd, that those Provinces which were too highly Tax'd should have an Abatement. He took off likewise many Impositions laid upon Imported Goods, and distributed with his own Hands many thousands of <HI>Ducats,</HI> wrapp'd up in Paper according to the Custom of the Countrey, be|ing all in honor to the Soul of the Deceased.</P>
<P>With the same Ceremonies a <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperor's Funeral was solemniz'd.</P>
<P>When an Emperor lies on his Death-bed, and that the Physicians begin to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Semedo.</NOTE> despair of his Recovery, the <HI>Colaos</HI> or chief Relations, and the prime Con|troller of the Palace, call'd <HI>Suikien,</HI> come to visit him, and to know his will and pleasure from his own Mouth, and the Contents of his Testament: Then they privately go to the Prince which is Heir to the Crown, and consult with him, that they may do nothing against his will, who is ready to enter on the Throne. Being thus inform'd of the one thing and the other, they write down the Will and bring it to the Emperor, that he may approve and allow of it: from thence they go and shew it to the prime Councellor call'd <HI>Hanhyuen,</HI> who ingrosses all the Emperor's Business; which being done, the Will is Seal'd with the Imperial Seal, and kept in the Star-Chamber belonging to the Emperor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Council so long as the Emperor lives.: after his Decease they shew it to the Court of Judicatory, that they may proclaim it in all Places of the Empire, and observe it punctually.</P>

<P>The Inhabitants of the City <HI>Sintien,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Queicheu,</HI> express great sorrow for either Father or Mothers Death, by cutting off the Hair of their Heads.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses,</HI> as <HI>Martinius</HI> witnesseth, are no less curious than superstitious in chusing the Ground for their Graves, judging that all their Fortune and Hap|piness depends upon it, because of a Being for the Dragon, to whom they ascribe their Salvation; wherefore they observe the shapes of the Hills on which they intend to make their Graves, and Dig up the Ground, not sparing either Cost or Charge, hoping to find the Head, Heart, or Tail of a Dragon: for they believe that thereby all Happiness and good Fortune will attend the Deceased's Successors.</P>
<P>Many People experienc'd in this Art, go through all <HI>China,</HI> and observe the shapes of Hills, just as the Astronomers take their view of the Stars.</P>

<HEAD>Government.</HEAD>
<P>IN the first Age before the general Deluge, the Government of <HI>China</HI> was divided amongst Tribes or Families, and the chief of every Tribe had his own Government, after the same manner as the ancient Fathers <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Lot;</HI> but since <HI>Anno</HI> 2952. before the Birth of our Saviour, they have been Govern'd by one sole Monarch or Emperor: for the Names of the two other Forms of Government, <HI>viz. Aristocracy</HI> and <HI>Democracy,</HI> the <HI>Chineses</HI> had never heard of: Nay, the <HI>Netherland</HI> Agents that were sent <HI>Anno</HI> 1655. to the Great <HI>Cham,</HI> Em|peror of <HI>East-Tartary</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> had great trouble with the <HI>Chineses</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> to make them understand the two last Forms of Government, which they could not apprehend.</P>
<P>The Emperor of <HI>China</HI> is sole Master of the Lives, Goods and Chattels of all his Subjects, he onely being chief Lord of all; wherefore the Empire of <HI>China</HI> may justly be call'd <HI>A perfect and absolute Monarchy.</HI></P>
<P>It is without doubt, that in ancient times under one supream Governor<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trigaut.</NOTE> were several substitute Lords, as Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, and the like; but eighteen or nineteen hundred years since those Titles of peculiar Governments and Power, were at once taken away and rooted out: onely in the Province of <HI>Iunnan</HI> are free Lords or Dukes to this day, that have their peculiar Domini|ons, which is in no Place else in <HI>China:</HI> Yet they acknowledge the Emperor, but Govern with an arbitrary Power over their Countreys, and succeed each other in their Government.</P>
<P>The Emperors, according to an ancient Custom yet in force, regard not<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin&punc; Histor. Sin. l. 7.</NOTE> their Subjects, but look upon them as Slaves, though they are or have been never so great Magistrates: for because the sole Government consists in the Power of one onely, they esteem themselves Masters of every Mans Goods, and likewise of the Lives of their Subjects; therefore no Honor or Preemi|nency is given but by the Emperor, neither is the ascent to the greatest Place of Dignity lockt up from any sort of People, though the scum of the Commo|nalty,
<PB N="393" REF="239">
but open'd to every one at the Emperor's pleasure&punc; for which reason he is by every one honor'd as a God, on whom all things depend, and by his severe Government is terrible, and to be feared. From hence it often proceeds, that for the smallest occasion, the most deserving Persons are by him bereav'd of their Employments, and others punish'd with Death, especially those whose Valour and Experience in Martial Affairs may upon the least suspicion be fear'd. This is not unknown to Collonels and Generals, especially the Grandees which Command great Armies; who for that reason are no less mistrustful of the Emperor than he suspicious of them: from whence they often rise to a Rebellion or Mutiny; for if they after a Conquest against their Enemy have discharg'd their Soldiers, they know they cannot escape death: which not deserving, they will rather chuse to make themselves to be fear'd by their valiant and heroick Exploits: from whence in the time of War arise continual Mutinies in <HI>China;</HI> and the greater the Mutinies be, the fiercer they are maintain'd by every one without respect of faithfulness.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses,</HI> before the <HI>Europeans</HI> coming thither, firmly believ'd that their<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin.</NOTE> Empire contain'd almost the whole World: not reckoning their neighboring Kingdoms, they made their Emperor Governor of the whole terrestrial Globe and call'd him Lord of all.</P>
<P>According to <HI>Semedo,</HI> the Ladies of Honor, Relations and others belonging to the Palace, call the Emperor <HI>Chu,</HI> and sometimes <HI>Tienzu,</HI> that is, <HI>Son of Hea|ven;</HI> not that they believe him to be born in Heaven, but that they look upon the Empire as the Gift of Heaven: and also to make the Respect due to the Im|perial Majesty the greater, and to seem sacred.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperor, saith Father <HI>Martin,</HI> is by his Subjects call'd <HI>Tienzu,</HI> that is, <HI>Son of Heaven;</HI> not that they derive his Original from thence, or that he was born there; but they call him <HI>Son of Heaven,</HI> because he is belov'd above all other Men, and hath on Earth given him (as they say) the greatest Dignity Heaven can afford: And because the <HI>Chineses</HI> oftentimes take Heaven, God, and the supream Godhead to be all one, therefore <HI>The Son of Heaven</HI> is as much as to say with them, <HI>The Son of God.</HI> Thus far <HI>Martinius.</HI></P>
<P>But the common and most esteem'd Name of the Emperor is <HI>Hoangti,</HI> or <HI>Hoamti,</HI> that is, according to <HI>Semedo</HI> and <HI>Trigaut, Emperor,</HI> or <HI>Supream Emperor;</HI> but according to <HI>Martinius, Sole Emperor,</HI> or <HI>Emperor of the Earth;</HI> which they say is of a yellow colour, for a distinction from <HI>Zangti,</HI> that is, <HI>Supream Emperor,</HI> or <HI>God, the Governor of Heaven and Earth.</HI></P>
<P>The first Emperor which was call'd <HI>Hoangti,</HI> Reign'd in <HI>Anno</HI> 2690. before the Birth of our Saviour, for whose excellent Vertues and publick In|ventions, the pleasing sound of his Name was so belov'd, that ever since all their Princes have been call'd <HI>Hoangti,</HI> as the <HI>German</HI> Emperors from their first, <HI>Caesar.</HI></P>
<P>There are yet two other Names which have the same signification of <HI>King,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Semedo.</NOTE> or <HI>Emperor,</HI> the one being <HI>Kium,</HI> which they use to name strange Kings by; and the other <HI>Vam,</HI> which is a Name for the Emperor's Children; to which by adding the word <HI>Kium</HI> they make a compound word <HI>Kiumvam,</HI> which signifies <HI>Imperial.</HI></P>
<P>It is also to be observ'd, that a new chosen Emperor changes his Name, like a new elected Pope, who takes upon him the Name of some of his Predeces|sors in stead of his own.</P>
<P>This Name of the Emperors, which they write in all manner of Procla|mations,
<PB N="394" REF="240">
and on their Coyn, is taken from a peculiar Person, Extracted of Royal-Blood.</P>
<P><HI>Martinius</HI> tells us, That all those of the Imperial Blood, or Family, are by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Atl. Simns.</NOTE> the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Fansu,</HI> as also by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> only with addition of the Let|ter <HI>r,</HI> which the <HI>Chineses</HI> cannot pronounce, and that <HI>Fansur,</HI> or <HI>Facsur;</HI> and <HI>Fan|su</HI> or <HI>Fansur</HI> signifies a <HI>Royal</HI> or <HI>Imperial House.</HI></P>
<P>The Empire of <HI>China,</HI> from <HI>Anno</HI> 2207. before the Birth of our Savior, hath had a Successive and Hereditary Government; for at the Fathers Death, the eldest Son Succeeds; and if there be no Male-Heir, then the nearest Relation.</P>
<P>If the Empress, (saith <HI>Semedo</HI>) the lawful Wife of the Emperor hath a Son, in what time soever he be Born, he takes place before all those that are Begot|ten by his Concubines, though Born before him; but if the Empress hath no Son, then the First-born, or eldest of a Concubine (who e're she be) is always Elected.</P>
<P>But Anciently, from <HI>Anno</HI> 2992. to <HI>Anno</HI> 2207. before the Birth of our Sa|vior, the nine first Emperors were elective and chosen by the most Voices, and took not by Succession; but after the Death of the ninth Emperor, <HI>Yu,</HI> his Son <HI>Khi,</HI> the Founder of the Family of <HI>Hia,</HI> was for his goodness and great Deserts, by general Suffrage, confirm'd Emperor in his Fathers stead; so that the Cu|stome of Election was chang'd to true and lawful Succession by Birth.</P>
<P>Sometimes it hath happen'd (though very seldom) that the youngest Son, contrary both to the Laws of Nature and the Realm, was declar'd Emperor, either for his extraordinary Valor or Prudence; as <HI>Anno</HI> 209. before the Birth of Christ, it happen'd to the Emperor <HI>Ulxi,</HI> who after his Father <HI>Cin's</HI> Death, was chosen Emperor in stead of his eldest Brother <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">sa.</HI></P>
<P>When the eldest Son hath taken Possession of the Throne, the rest only boast of their Princely Allyance, for they have not in the least any Authori|ty; yet the Emperor gives them each a City to reside in, with a Magnificent Palace, Attendants, and Revenues, where they keep Court in great State, and are serv'd accordingly, yet have no Command of the Citizens; and that they might not have so much together, as to enable them to raise a Commotion, the Emperor's Allowance is paid them every three Moneths, and on forfeiture of their Lives, they may not stir out of the Limits of the City, so design'd for their subsistance.</P>
<P>The Empire hath sometimes also been Govern'd by a Woman, for <HI>Anno</HI> 490.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin. Histor. Sini<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE> before the Nativity of Christ, the Emperor <HI>Lieupang's</HI> Consort, after the Death of <HI>Hoci</HI> her Son, Govern'd the Countrey eight years.</P>
<P>At the Election of a new Emperor, thirteen Contingencies are to be<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> observ'd.</P>
<P>The first is the alteration of annual Accounts, for they begin to reckon from the Inauguration of their new Emperor, which they use not only in common Discourses, but in their Letters, and all manner of Writings: The Emperor also gives his Name to that Year in which he begins to Reign; for we must<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin.</NOTE> observe, that all the Years of any Emperor's Raign, when soe're they die, are reckon'd for whole Years, and so make his Coronation the <HI>New-Years-Day,</HI> that is, the beginning of the Year; and yet, though the <HI>Chineses</HI> immediately, and in the same Year have another, yet they still shew Honor and Obedience to the late Emperor, though Dead, till the Years end, doing all things in his Name; and likewise all Edicts and Proclamations are Seal'd and Mark'd with the same Signets, as if he were still living; but the Successor gives his Name to the following Year.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="240">The second, they instantly Coyn new Money, with the Letters of his Name,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Semed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</NOTE> which doth not abate any thing of the value of the old Coyn.</P>
<P>The third, his Lawful Wife is Crown'd Empress.</P>
<P>The fourth, they give the Name of Queen to six of his Concubines.</P>
<P>The fifth, they make Offerings to the Heavens, Earth, and Spirits.</P>
<P>The sixth, they bestow great Alms on the Poor.</P>
<P>The seventh, all Prisoners are set at liberty.</P>
<P>The eighth, all the Magistrates are nobly Treated.</P>
<P>The ninth, all the Women that were Concubines before, are put out of the Palace.</P>
<P>The tenth, the <HI>Seraglioes,</HI> which are four in number, are fill'd with fresh Beauties fetch'd from all parts of the Empire; during which time there are ma|ny Marriages, because every one seeks to free his Daughter from such a re|tired Life.</P>
<P>The eleventh, Persons of Quality, if not all, at least those of Cities, either come themselves, or send Agents to shew Obedience, and acknowledge the new Emperor.</P>
<P>The twelfth, all Officers from the Vice-Roys to the inferior Governors of Cities, go in Person to the Court, to shew the same Obedience, and take the Oath of Allegiance in behalf of their Towns and Provinces.</P>
<P>The thirteenth is, that the Emperor changes his own Name, as is before|mention'd.</P>
<P>The Reverence which the <HI>Chineses</HI> anciently shew'd to their Kings, they per|form'd in this manner.</P>
<P>They Prostrate themselves to him, bowing down their Bodies, and looking<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin Sin&punc; Histor. l. 4.</NOTE> with their Faces to the North, for they say, that their Kings look always to the South; for which reason all the Gates of their Palaces, Doors of Cham|bers, and all Draw-Bridges face the South; from whence proceeds a Proverb, <HI>That the</HI> Chineses, <HI>though at great distance, always honor their King, when with usual Ceremonies they receive their Guests.</HI></P>
<P>They say, that the <HI>Tartar</HI> Prince, who at this day possesseth the Countrey of <HI>China,</HI> and resides in the Metropolis <HI>Peking,</HI> is not the great <HI>Cham</HI> or Lord of all <HI>Tartary,</HI> as hath hitherto been believ'd, but a mean Prince of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> whose Grand-father was the first King of his Family, promoted to that Dignity by the Inhabitants of his Countrey, which was only a small Province in <HI>Tartary</HI> call'd <HI>Muncheu.</HI></P>
<P>The Father of this present Emperor, call'd <HI>Zunchi,</HI> was the fifth of his Fami|ly; his Fortune seem'd to be so strange in the Eyes of other Princes of his Coun|trey, that they compar'd him to <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">As the <HI>Rom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s</HI> call'd <HI>Scip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">o Africanus</HI> the Thun|der-bolt of War.</NOTE> Lightning, when e're they spake of him, for they usually said, that the Gods and Heavens could only prevent him in any thing.</P>
<P>The present Emperor <HI>Zunchi</HI>'s Son is call'd <HI>Konchi,</HI> a Youth, of about six|teen years.</P>
<P>The first Ruler, of whom the <HI>Chineses</HI> make mention in their Histories, was nam'd <HI>Puoncu;</HI> and after him <HI>Tienhoang, Ginhoang,</HI> and <HI>Yonjui;</HI> but in those times the Provinces were govern'd by the Heads of their Princical Families.</P>
<P>The first Emperors that before the Birth of our Saviour Govern'd <HI>China,</HI> and were Elected and set on the Throne by most Voices, were eight in num|ber, <HI>viz.</HI> from the Year before the Nativity of Christ 2952. to the Year 2207. before which the <HI>Chineses</HI> allow of none in their Histories, which in that
<PB N="396" REF="241">
time are stuff'd with many strange and fabulous Relations, as well concerning the Age of Men, as Years of the Governors; for if we will credit their Wri|ters, the World stood many Thousands of Years before the Deluge.</P>

<P>These are the Names of the Emperors, every one in their Families, before the Birth of our Saviour, according as they are written in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Chroni|cles, Translated into Latin by Father <HI>Martyn;</HI> but those that have Raign'd since the Incarnation, I have receiv'd no account of, being not yet render'd to us in any other Language.</P>
<P>After the Family of <HI>Han</HI> arose that of <HI>Cyn,</HI> and flourish'd after the Birth of Christ, till <HI>Anno</HI> 1419. At the same time were also five Kings, call'd <HI>Utai,</HI> which maintain'd War against one another, till by their Ruine, the Family <HI>Tang</HI> took upon them the sole Government of <HI>China,</HI> which they kept till <HI>Anno</HI> 618.</P>
<P>In the Year 923. the Family <HI>Sung</HI> succeeded that of <HI>Tang,</HI> and Raign'd over all <HI>China,</HI> till <HI>Anno</HI> 1278. when this House was utterly subdu'd by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> who set up the Family of <HI>Iuen,</HI> which Govern'd <HI>China</HI> till 1368. in which Year rose the House of <HI>Taiming,</HI> from a Priest call'd <HI>Chu,</HI> who drove the <HI>Tartars</HI> out
<PB N="398" REF="242">

<P>The Magistrates or Governors in <HI>China,</HI> taken in general, are of two De|grees or Orders; the first are such, as not only in the Metropolis officiate the places of Privy Councellors, but from thence have influence over the whole Empire; the other are such as Govern peculiar Provinces or Cities.</P>
<P>The general Government, or that of the first Degree, are by <HI>Alvarez Semedo</HI> describ'd in the following words:</P>
<P>The Prime Government of <HI>China</HI> consists in six Benches, Chambers, or Courts, which by a general Name are call'd <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Like our King's-Bench, or Superior Courts of Judicature.</NOTE> <HI>Pu,</HI> that is, <HI>The Kings Benches.</HI></P>
<P>These manage not only the Affairs of the Realm, in the Courts where they reside, but like the Head, on which all the other depend, Rule, and give Or|ders to them, according to their several places.</P>
<P>Every Councel hath his President, which they call <HI>Chamxu,</HI> with two Assi|stants, the one nam'd <HI>Koxilam,</HI> who is the Chief, and sits on the left Hand, (by them counted most honorable;) and the other <HI>Yeuxilam.</HI></P>
<P>These are the first and most profitable Offices of the Empire, except that of <HI>Kolao's;</HI> so that a <HI>Tutang</HI> or Vice-Roy of what Province so e're it be, after he hath given Testimony of his Capacity, if he would be Promoted, thinks him|self well provided for, though not a Prime Councellor, to be only one of the Assistants, that sit on the left, or right Hand.</P>
<P>Besides these, there is a Councel of <HI>Ten,</HI> which are of equal Dignity, only distinguish'd by several Titles, and deciding of different Causes: To these are to be added, the vast numbers of greater and lesser Officers, as Notaries, Secre|taries, Clerks, Servants, Officers, and such as we call Bayliffs, besides many others, not known in <HI>Europe,</HI></P>
<P>The first Councel or Court which have the greatest Command, and receive the highest Presents and greatest Fees, are the Councel of State, call'd <HI>Lipu,</HI> that is properly, <HI>Councel of Magistrates,</HI> for <HI>Pu</HI> signifies a Councel, and <HI>Li</HI> Magistrates.</P>
<P>To these belong all the Offices in the Empire, to change or promote them; for he who is once in an Employment, rises continually by degrees to higher Dignities.</P>
<P>They have also Power to restore those to their Employments that are dis|plac'd; as if a <HI>Mandarin</HI> is for some Misdemeanor put out of his place, he may easily obtain it again, if he be in favor with this Councel.</P>
<P>The second Bench is call'd <HI>Pimpu,</HI> that is, <HI>Councel of War,</HI> which have as great a Command as those of State, <HI>viz.</HI> over all the <HI>Militia,</HI> with the Schools and Academies, and for instruction of Youth in Martial Discipline, and the Exer|cise of Arms.</P>
<P>The third is of the Customs, call'd <HI>Limpu,</HI> which though not of great Com|mands, yet they are of no less Quality, for the <HI>Mandarins</HI> in which it consists, are chosen out of the Emperor's Councel <HI>Hanlin,</HI> which are next to the <HI>Kolao's,</HI> the Prime place of Honor in <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>This Council hath knowledge of all Letters, and likewise of Ecclesiastical Affairs, <HI>Bonzies,</HI> Strangers, and the like.</P>
<P>The fourth Councel is that of the Emperor's Revenues, call'd <HI>Hupu,</HI> which take care to get in the Emperor's Treasure, Customs, Farms, and in general, all things that bring in Money.</P>
<P><PB N="399" REF="242">The fifth, call'd <HI>Cumpu,</HI> look after all business of Building and Architecture, and especially what belongs to the Emperor's Palace, or those of his Children and Officers; as also the Walls and Gates of the City, High-ways, and Bridges.</P>
<P>The same Council are also to take care that the Rivers be cleans'd, and Ships furnish'd with Necessaries, when sent out upon the Emperor's Service.</P>
<P>The sixth Chamber call'd <HI>Himpiu,</HI> that is, <HI>Councel of Iustice,</HI> are to punish Ma|lefactors, and pass Sentence of Life and Death on Criminals.</P>
<P>The same Councels or Chambers the Jesuit <HI>Nicolas Trigaut</HI> hath describ'd al|most after the same manner in the following words.</P>
<P>The Prime Councellors or Courts are six in number.</P>
<P>The first call'd <HI>Lipu,</HI> signifies, <HI>The Bench of the Magistrates.</HI></P>
<P>This Councel exeeeds all the rest, for they name or choose all the Magi|strates of the Philosophick, or Learned Order of the whole Realm, which are accounted the most eminent, and continually rise higher and higher, if they have in their Inferior Offices made but the least Proofs of their Vertue and good Behavior; and on the contrary, if they commit but one Fault, they are bereav'd of their Imployments, or put into meaner Offices.</P>
<P>The first choice consists in the excellent Writing in <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters, of which, this Court judges.</P>
<P>The second Councel (by <HI>Semedo</HI> the fourth) is call'd <HI>Hopu,</HI> that is, <HI>The Court of Revenue,</HI> or <HI>Exchequer,</HI> which have the Command of the Empires Revenue and Taxes, gathering Customs, paying Souldiers, and the like.</P>
<P>The third Councel is call'd <HI>Lipu,</HI> that is, <HI>The Council,</HI> or <HI>Court of Ceremonies,</HI> which takes care for Common Offerings, Temples, Priests, the Emperor's Wo|men, Schools, examining of the Learned, Weddings, and other Ceremonies to be perform'd to the Emperor, on certain times and occasions.</P>
<P>The same Council also give Titles of Honor to deserving Persons; incou|rage Artificers; send Noble-men to meet Ambassadors, and return An|swers to Letters directed to the Emperor; who looks upon it as a great dis|grace to write a Letter with his own Hand, either to one in, or without his Dominions.</P>
<P>The fourth call'd <HI>Pimpu,</HI> which signifies, <HI>Council of War,</HI> Command over Ci|vil and Military Affairs, which concern the Safety and Defence of the Empire, yet they cannot resolve on any thing, without the Emperor's consent and know|ledge.</P>
<P>This Councel bestows all Military Offices, removing Cowards, and putting in Valiant Men; and likewise, honor the deserv'd with great Titles.</P>
<P>The fifth call'd <HI>Cumpu,</HI> that is, <HI>The Councel over all manner of Buildings,</HI> look to the Erecting of publick Structures and Palaces, for the Emperor, his Allies, and Magistrates; and likewise to the building of his Ships, and Rigging out of whole Navies, and the repair of Bridges and Walls about the City.</P>
<P>The sixth Councel, call'd <HI>Humpu,</HI> are Judges, to Determine and Debate of Criminals, and all manner of Differences: The whole business of Judicatory in all the Empire depending on this Court, for they have in every Province and City, appointed Magistrates and Clerks, which advise them faithfully of all Transactions; so that they in this their Office, being of great concern, have no small trouble, but that the great number of Deputies which they imploy un|der them, ease them of the most part; for there is a Chief-Justice of the whole Court, whom they call <HI>Ciamcui,</HI> which hath two Assistants, one sits on his
<PB N="400" REF="243">
right, and the other on his left Hand, being nam'd <HI>Cilam,</HI> which three Persons in the Metropolis <HI>Peking,</HI> are accounted amongst the greatest in Quality, and according to their pleasure, every Court is divided into several Degrees; be|sides these, all Courts have their Secretaries, Clerks, Messengers, and other Servants.</P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>Ya,</HI> who began to Raign before the Birth of our Savior, <HI>Anno</HI> 2357. first establish'd these six Courts, according to the Relation of Father <HI>Mar|tin,</HI> in his first Book of the History of <HI>China,</HI> wherein he says,</P>
<P>Afterwards the Emperor <HI>Ya</HI> brought the State of <HI>China</HI> to a new and better form, by establishing six Courts: One of which is call'd <HI>Lipu,</HI> which takes Cognizance of the Well-behaving, or Mis-behaving of the Magistrates, and to bestow on every one according to their Merits, either higher Dignities, or else bereave them of their Places.</P>
<P>The second is call'd <HI>Pingpu,</HI> that is, <HI>Councel of War,</HI> or <HI>Prime Martial Court,</HI> which have the same Command over the Martial Officers, as the former over the Civil.</P>
<P>The third is <HI>Lipu,</HI> that is, <HI>A Court of Ceremonies,</HI> or <HI>Customs,</HI> who Supervise Ec|clesiastick Affairs, Offerings, entertaining foreign Ambassadors, and other such like Businesses.</P>
<P>The fourth is call'd <HI>Hupu,</HI> which Receive, and render an Account of the Em|peror's Revenue.</P>
<P>The fifth is call'd <HI>Cumpu,</HI> which take care to look after the Repairing and Building of publick Structures, the Emperor's Palaces, Walls of the Cities, Ri|vers, Ships, and High-ways, that they may not be Dirty or Incommodious.</P>
<P>The sixth is <HI>Hingpu,</HI> or <HI>Court of Iustice,</HI> where all Causes relating to Life and Death are Determin'd; which Courts being so Constituted by the Emperor <HI>Ya,</HI> Govern the whole Empire of <HI>China</HI> in good Order, and acknowledge no Su|perior but the Emperor and the <HI>Kolaos.</HI></P>
<P>According to others, the Privy-Councel consists in six Persons, who never Consult but about Weighty Matters of State. This Councel or Assembly is call'd <HI>Loepol;</HI> each of these hath his peculiar Chamber, and is also the Head of another Court, in which the businesses of his Camber are Debated: These Councellors take as many to their Assistants as they judge necessary.</P>
<P>The first of these is President of the Councel of State, and his Assembly is call'd <HI>Lipol.</HI></P>
<P>The second hath Charge of all Warlike businesses, Revenues of the Empire, and hath also Power to give Commissions.</P>
<P>The third looks after Architecture, keeping an account of what Edifices are yearly built in the Empire; and likewise of the Charges expended in Repair|ing of Towns, Forts, High-ways, Streets, and Moats: This is call'd <HI>Congpol.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth, which takes care of the Customs and Taxes of the Empire, are nam'd <HI>Olpol.</HI></P>
<P>The fifth is (as we may call him) Lord-Chief-Justice, and Pronounces the Sentences resolv'd on in his Court, call'd <HI>Ungpol.</HI></P>
<P>The sixth and last hath the Command of all Places and Offices of the Magi|strates, and gives them to those, who by their Learning, good Deportment, and civil Carriage, are accounted the most Worthy.</P>
<P>In this manner the Government of <HI>China</HI> hath continu'd many Ages, which after the first Conquest by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> under the Emperor <HI>Xunchi,</HI> was not chang'd; except, only adding to every one of the six <HI>Chinese</HI> Councellors, a Per|son
<PB N="401" REF="243">
of his own Countrey; so that the Grand Councel of the Realm consisted in twelve Persons, all equally Commission'd as before-said.</P>
<P>These Councellors of State before-mention'd, cannot resolve on any thing without a general consent; therefore no business is concluded on, but by Plu|rality of Voices: When the Assembly is broke up, and every Councellor con|sults with his private <HI>Cabal;</HI> then a <HI>Tartar</HI> (as we said) is added to them; but since that, in the Raign of the Emperor <HI>Konchi,</HI> the <HI>Chineses</HI> are put out of all Of|fices, and the <HI>Tartars</HI> have wholly Appropriated them to themselves.</P>
<P>Besides these six, there are nine other Chambers or Benches, call'd <HI>Kieu|kim,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Semedo.</NOTE> whose Offices are several, but they chiefly take care of the Emperor's Houshold.</P>
<P>The first call'd <HI>Thailisu,</HI> that is, <HI>The Grand Exchequer,</HI> consists in thirteen <HI>Man|darins, viz.</HI> one Prime Councellor, two Assistants, and ten inferior Judges; This resembles the <HI>Chancery</HI> of the Realm, perusing all the Judgments given in other Courts, and according to Equity disallowing or confirming the same.</P>
<P>The second call'd <HI>Quanlosu,</HI> that is, <HI>Comptroler of the Court,</HI> taking care for the Emperor's Table, observing the Transactions of the Empress, Concubines, and paying Wages to all Court-Officers, and others that follow publick Im|ployments; entertaining foraign Ambassadors and the like Persons of Qua|lity, and consists of one Prime Councellor, two Assistants, and six petty Judges.</P>
<P>The third, <HI>Thaipocusu,</HI> is like the Master of the Horse, and takes care, not on|ly for the Horses for the Emperor's Service, but likewise (as Post-Master-Gene|ral) for all Posts, and in general, for all others which serve the whole Empire. This consists in one prime Councellor, and six Assistants.</P>
<P>The fourth is that of the Ceremonies, performing all manner of Duties, requisite at publick Treats of the Emperor, Festivals, and at all other times and occasions; and likewise those which are duly observ'd every Morning at the going in and out of the Palace; and consists in one Prime Councellor, two Grand, and six Inferior Assistants.</P>
<P>The fifth is that of the Customs in peculiar businesses; and though this differs from the first, yet they observe the same things by the help of their Assistants. They also take care to see due Offerings perform'd at the Emperor's Grave; for Artificial Hills, Woods, and all things else; as likewise for Singing-Boys, Musicians, and Beasts for the Oblations.</P>
<P>There is yet another Court of Justice, whose business is only to present the Emperor with all manner of Memorials, and bringing them all together into the <HI>Chancery,</HI> like the King's Remembrancers.</P>
<P>All manner of Businesses are shewn the Emperor in Writing, according to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin&punc; Histor&punc; Sinic. <HI>l 9.</HI></NOTE> an antient Custom of the Emperor <HI>Suven,</HI> who Raign'd before the Birth of our Saviour, <HI>Anno</HI> 73. that the Emperor having consider'd thereof, he might the bet|ter return his Answer in Writing; for it often happend (said he) that People by fine Words, and pleasing Language, might perswade him to any thing, which granting in a sudden humor, they had often cause to repent: From whence it happens, that though the Emperors do seldom appear to their People, yet they continually converse with them by Petitions or Letters.</P>
<P>To the six Councellors are to be added three more, the same in manner or fashion, though differing in Offices and Imployments.</P>
<P>Besides all these, there are yet two more; the one call'd <HI>Qholi,</HI> and the other <HI>Tauli,</HI> and though both have their eyes over several Provinces, and every one
<PB N="402" REF="244">
concern themselves with Businesses within their peculiar Spheres and Offices, minding all Transactions and Disorders in the Empire. These Councellors, as it is easie to tell of others Mens Faults, act them with great freedom, and of|tentimes commit many unjust Actions. Their manner of complaining in this kind, is to make a Copy thereof, and to shew it to the Emperor: Immediate|ly after the same (as they say, is <HI>Facheo</HI>) that is, Coppied out and deliver'd to Clerks appointed for that purpose, which make several Writings of it, and send them by Messengers through all the Empire, so that it is immediately known by, and against what Person those Writings are publish'd, and a large Description of what he is. These Letters, which the <HI>Chineses</HI> call <HI>Iuen,</HI> thus publish'd, the Accused against whom it is written must immediately, <HI>Volens No|lens,</HI> do two things, the first of which is to write a Petition, not to justifie or ex|cuse himself, but to acknowledge that the <HI>Tauli</HI> had great Reason, and he in Fault; that he hath offended, for which he is sorrowful, and ready to undergo such Punishment as they please to inflict upon him: The next is speedily to be gone and leave his Place without farther intermedling, till the Emperor hath given his Answer to the Petition, which sometimes proves favorable, being permitted to re-enjoy his Office; but otherwhiles the Emperor commands him to be punish'd according to the greatness of his Crime.</P>
<P>It often happens, that a <HI>Mandarin</HI> by diligence in his Office, and observing his Business more than ordinary, begets Enemies; and if any of these be acquaint|ed with, or ally'd to any Officers of these two Courts, then theydo his Bu|siness immediately at Court, and send the Memorials from one to another, so that the poor <HI>Mandarin</HI> is in a miserable condition, and especially if he be a Judge, Deputy-Governor, or over the <HI>Militia.</HI> Yet far greater trouble they have with the <HI>Tauli</HI> and <HI>Qholi,</HI> who neglect not the least opportunity to prose|cute to such heighth, that the Emperor himself, though he have an inclination, cannot free them.</P>
<P><HI>Trigaut</HI> describes these two Councils, <HI>Qholi</HI> and <HI>Tauli,</HI> in the following manner:</P>
<P>Every one of them consists in above sixty Persons, all Philosophers, aged and wise People, which before have made no small proofs of their Loyalty to the Emperor and Realm.</P>
<P>These Consult of all private and publick Affairs, which they Judge and Determine, being thereto authoriz'd by the Emperor's special Commission, which makes them to be not a little honor'd and respected by the People. But above all, their chiefest Office is to inform the Emperor by Letters, if any thing be acted against the Laws, and also to tell the Emperor and his Allies of their Faults.</P>
<P>This Office, in my Opinion, differs not much from the <HI>Lacedemonian Ephori;</HI> for they never regard the Magistrates, nor miss to tell the Emperor of his Misdemeanors, such is their Authority and Respect: And notwithstanding the Emperor is often displeased with them, yet they cease not to admonish then by words, till they have perswaded and made them sensible of their Errors.</P>
<P>This is likewise by the power of the Law priviledg'd to all Magistrates, and not onely to them, but every particular Substitute; yet the Petitions of the <HI>Qholi</HI> and <HI>Tauli</HI> are most esteem'd, because they do it meerly as being their Employ|ment. The Copies of the Petitions, and the Emperor's Answer thereon, are Printed in great quantities, whereby all Court Businesses are soon known in seve|ral Places. There are those which make a Book of all the Petitions, Printed as be|fore;
<PB N="403" REF="244">
nay, if any thing be remarkable in them for their Predecessors, it is writ|in the Chronicles.</P>
<P>These Governors us'd formerly an undaunted freedom and confidence in the admonishing of their Kings and Emperors, when they saw them wander from the way of Vertue, to the great admiration of the People of <HI>Europe,</HI> which are debarr'd of this freedom. It is certain that these Governors understand the Mysteries of Philosophy, and endeavor by all means possible to extol the Heavens by Praises, and other acts of Devotion. It was not onely in ancient times, but now also customary amongst the <HI>Chineses,</HI> that the Governors, when their good admonishment was not regarded by the Emperor, they laid down their Apparel and Badges of their Offices before him, declaring publickly, that they would no longer Serve in their Places; and the more boldly they throw them down, if the Emperor designs any thing which they fear may prove pre|judicial to the Realm, and that he will not hearken to them.</P>
<P>It hapned some years since, that the Emperor <HI>Vanlie,</HI> who clouded all his Atchievements by his insatiably lustful desires; for notwithstanding he had a lawful Son, yet he would declare a Bastard to be Heir of the Empire: but the Peers and Governors being against it, said they would not suffer so base an Election; yet the Emperor not regarding their Saying, all the Magi|strates that were in the City, being to the number of two thousand, went to the Palace, and forc'd him against his will, by laying off their Liveries, to de|clare the lawful Heir to be Successor.</P>
<P>The like occasion hapned <HI>Anno</HI> 1651. for when after the Death of the Guar|dian and Unkle to the young Emperor, another <HI>Tartar</HI> would Govern, alledg|ing that the Emperor's Age was not fit for such a Management, all the Gover|nors laid down their Badges, whereby he was forc'd to desist: and in this man|ner a Youth of sixteen years old call'd <HI>Xunghi,</HI> being the true Heir, took upon him the Government.</P>
<P>Besides these Magistrates, or Privy-Councellors at the Court, there are seve|ral<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trigaut.</NOTE> other Offices, or Council-Chambers, for divers Businesses, but the chiefest and most honorable is that which is call'd <HI>Hanlinyuen,</HI> into which none but Learned Doctors are admitted.</P>
<P>Those which are in this Imperial Office, do nothing but Read several Books, and may not trouble themselves with publick Concerns, when as nevertheless they exceed those that sit at the Helm, wherefore many endeavor greatly to get into their Society. Their Business is onely to write the Emperor's Letters, Annual Chronicles, and to make Laws and Ordinances. Out of these are also chose the Tutors for the Emperor's and Princes.</P>
<P>In this Society are several degrees of Honor, which every one attains to by their writing a good Style; after which they are rais'd to the highest Prefer|ment within the Court. None are chose to be of that most eminent Office of <HI>Colao,</HI> but out of them.</P>
<P>Those that are in this Society make great advantages by writing Epistles and Encomiums of their Friends; nay, every one accounts himself happy if he can but get them, bestowing great Charge and trouble to that end: for if they have but the Name that they are made by them, they are accounted excellent, though never so bad.</P>
<P>Lastly, those that are of this Society, are chief Councellors and Judges in the Examinations of Causes, both Divine and Moral, and are by the Profes|sors of Sciences accounted Masters of Literature.</P>
<P><PB N="404" REF="245">Besides all these Courts, there is one supream Court, which is the chief in<NOTE PLACE="marg">Semedo.</NOTE> the whole Empire. None can be receiv'd into this, unless they have been of the Imperial Society call'd <HI>Hanlin,</HI> or <HI>Hanlinyuen</HI> before mention'd, and after they have a considerable time been in Places of Government, and made suffici|ent proofs of their Mildness, Policy and Prudence, and that no Letters of Complaint have been set out against them. This Court consists of four, or at most of six Persons, which are call'd <HI>Colaos</HI> and <HI>Coglogs.</HI></P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>Vanlie,</HI> Grandfather to the Emperor <HI>Zunchin,</HI> would never suf|fer more than one <HI>Colao,</HI> alledging that the rest were needless.</P>
<P>The Quality of <HI>Colao,</HI> to speak properly, is no peculiar Office, because they take care of the general Government of the State, and are just like Supream Judges of all Courts and Dominions in the whole Empire, though they are never all together but when they dispatch grand Business for the Emperor, who being not always present upon the concluding, they are many times forc'd to be in the Palace to answer those Petitions which are hourly brought to the Empe|ror. This done, they are necessitated to find out the Emperor, and inform him of their several Results; which having heard, he doth Justice to the Parties, and pronounces the ultimate Sentence, by either confirming or altering their Conclusions.</P>
<P>These <HI>Colaos</HI> are in the highest esteem, and above all the Councels or Magi|strates, who at a certain time come and shew Reverence to them as their Supe|riors, in an open Hall. The <HI>Colaos</HI> during this Ceremony stand up, and all the Officers according to their Degrees walk cross the Hall; coming before them they turn about, and bow their Heads down to the Ground: which Ceremo|ny is call'd <HI>Quo Tham,</HI> that is, <HI>Passing through the Hall.</HI></P>
<P>There is also a great difference betwixt the <HI>Colaos</HI> Robes and those of the other Magistrates, for their Girdles are beset with Precious Stones, which they call <HI>Yuxe,</HI> which none but <HI>Colaos</HI> may wear in the whole Empire; nay, they receive their Orders by the Emperor's own Hand, as the Knights amongst us their Honor from the King himself.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Nicholas Trigaut</HI> describes the <HI>Colaos</HI> Authority and Office in the fol|lowing words:</P>
<P>Besides these six Courts there is another, the most eminent in the whole Realm and the Emperor's Palace: those which belong to it are call'd <HI>Colaos,</HI> and are generally three or four in number, and sometimes six. They have charge of no particular Business, but mind the general Concerns of the Em|pire, and sit in private Consultation with the Emperor daily in his Palace. And in regard the Emperor at present doth not appear in Person at Treaties of publick Affairs of the Realm, which he formerly us'd to dispatch, they stay the whole day in the Palace, and answer Petitions, which in great numbers are brought, according as they think fit: with which Answers they go to the Emperor, who <HI>Regio Nutu,</HI> by his Beck either confirms or alters them. Thus far <HI>Trigaut.</HI></P>
<P>The like Quality and Office Father <HI>Martin</HI> ascribes to them in the following<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">. Hist. Sinens<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s</NOTE> words:</P>
<P>The six Courts, <HI>viz. Lypu, Hupu, Pingpu, Cungpu, Hingpu,</HI> are not concern'd in publick Matters of the whole Realm, but onely with private Consultations: for the Governors make their Requests to the Emperor by way of Petition, who having consider'd of the Business, sends them to every Court to which they belong, the Assistants whereof, after serious Consideration, acquaint the Em|peror
<PB N="405" REF="245">
with their Opinons in Writing, which he then, according to his pleasure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">m Histor. Sinic.</NOTE> either vacates or affirms; which that he may the better be able to do, he chu|ses some of the prime Philosophers in the whole Empire for his Assistants, who are call'd <HI>Colaos,</HI> or <HI>Caising,</HI> that is, <HI>Assistants in Government.</HI> These are in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">stor. Sinic.</NOTE> next Degree to the Emperor, and aid him in dispatching of Business, Consult|ing with him in Person, as being his Privy-Council, for he is seldom seen by any other Magistrates, Judges, Justices, or Councellors. Thus far <HI>Martin.</HI></P>
<P>Those which the <HI>Chineses</HI> call <HI>Colao,</HI> we (if we observe the original of the Name) should term <HI>Assistants to the Emperor;</HI> partly for their honorable Em|ployment, and partly as being next the Emperor, the prime Governors of the whole Realm.</P>
<P>Thus far of the general Government and Councils, or Offices of the Realm, which so long as the Empire was Govern'd by the <HI>Chineses,</HI> had their Residence at the Courts in <HI>Nanking</HI> and <HI>Peking,</HI> for all the Councils and Magistrates which are at the Imperial Court in <HI>Peking,</HI> were formerly (except the <HI>Colaos</HI>) in <HI>Nan|king,</HI> the Metropolis and Court of the ancient <HI>Chinese</HI> Princes; but they were far below those in <HI>Peking,</HI> because of the Emperor's absence, who held his Court in <HI>Peking,</HI> as at this day the <HI>Tartar,</HI> Emperor of <HI>China.</HI> The Court was remov'd from <HI>Peking</HI> on this occasion:</P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>Humvu</HI> having driven out the <HI>Tartars Anno</HI> 1368. planted the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trigaut.</NOTE> Seat of the Empire in <HI>Nanking.</HI> After his Decease one of his Nephews call'd <HI>Yunlo,</HI> who in the Northern Provinces lay with an Army in the Borders of the Empire as Vice-Roy, there to be a Guard against the <HI>Tartars,</HI> concluded to be|reave <HI>Humvu</HI>'s Heir of the Crown, and make himself Master of it: To which purpose having gotten the Northern Provinces to joyn with him, he came with his Army to <HI>Nanking,</HI> and got the other. Provinces either by Policy, Strength or Presents, and expell'd <HI>Humvu</HI>'s Son. But because <HI>Yunlo</HI>'s greatest Strength and Dependence was in the Northern Provinces, and that it was to be believ'd, that the <HI>Tartars</HI> to re-gain the Empire would fall in on that Place, he setled himself in that part of the Countrey, and in the same City in which the <HI>Tartar</HI> Emperors, when they Govern'd the <HI>Chineses,</HI> had their Residence, there to resist the Enemy if he should make any Attempt; yet still continu'd the Emperor's Palace and the Magistrates in <HI>Nanking.</HI> But after the Conquest of <HI>China</HI> by the <HI>Tartars, Anno</HI> 1644. the City of <HI>Nanking</HI> was bereav'd of her Imperial Title, and all the Magistrates belonging to the Emperor's Court; nay, the Palace of the ancient <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperors, besides many stately Memori|als were all pull'd down to the Ground, without any other damage to the City. The <HI>Tartars</HI> also chang'd the Name of the City and Province, and in stead of <HI>Nanking</HI> call'd it <HI>Kiangnan;</HI> and the City which formerly was call'd <HI>Intien, Kiangning.</HI> All which was done by the <HI>Tartars</HI> out of an inveterate hatred against the <HI>Taimingian</HI> Family, because <HI>Humvu,</HI> or <HI>Chu,</HI> the first raiser of that House, drove them or their Predecessors shamefully out of the Empire, after they had possess'd it a hundred and eight years.</P>
<P>All the Magistrates, as well belonging to the Learned Council as Martial Affairs, are by a general Name in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Quonfu,</HI> that is, <HI>To set before:</HI> but for their Quality and not their Office they are call'd <HI>Lavye,</HI> or <HI>Lausu,</HI> or <HI>Lavja's,</HI> which signifies <HI>Lords,</HI> or <HI>Parents.</HI> The <HI>Netherlanders,</HI> ac|cording to the example of the <HI>Portuguese,</HI> call them <HI>Mandarins,</HI> that is, <HI>Comman|ders,</HI> or <HI>Governors,</HI> deriv'd from the <HI>Portuguese</HI> word <HI>Mandarim,</HI> which is, <HI>A Com|mander.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="406" REF="246">Notwithstanding all the Magistrates or Governors flie at the Emperor's Beck, and have Orders amongst themselves, yet every one Serves in his Office with full Power, except he be commanded to the contrary by his Superiors. There are so many Governors in <HI>China,</HI> and Magistrates (they being, accor|ding to <HI>Martinius,</HI> to the number of eleven thousand) that it is hard to know their several Orders. For this reason five or six Books of a considerable big|ness are to be bought through the whole Empire, containing the Names of the publick Magistrates, and Governors of Provinces, with the Places of their Birth, Employments and Quality. These Books, according to <HI>Martinius,</HI> are Re-printed every three Moneths; which must be done of necessity, for in such great numbers of Magistrates, without putting those into the Books that are of less Quality, are daily great Changes, some dying, others put out of their Employments, some degraded into lesser Offices, or losing their Parents; by reason of which last Accident they are forc'd to desert their Government, though never so great, and travel home, and there Mourn three years, and therefore great numbers are continually at the Court of <HI>Peking,</HI> in hopes to succeed in the vacant Places.</P>
<P>As to what concerns the Government of the Provinces in particular, it<NOTE PLACE="marg">Semedo.</NOTE> stands in this manner:</P>
<P>The supream Government of a Province is generally manag'd in the Me|tropolis, and consists in Societies, that have a general Power over the whole Province. Amongst these are two prime Courts, to which all the other, as as well of Towns as Villages, must submit, because they receive their Com|missions from the Imperial Court. This Court consists in one sole Judge, without any Assistants or other Officers, which is the Vice-Roy of the Province, in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Tutham,</HI> or <HI>Kiu-Muen,</HI> whose Command extends over all the Magistrates and People of the Province. During his time of Go|vernment, which lasts three years, he keeps several Messengers, which go to, and come from the Court at certain times, to give an account of what hath pass'd in his Jurisdiction. He is receiv'd with great State into his Dominions. After his departure from Court his Councellors and other Officers go before, and he is conducted from City to City by the Inhabitants. Some Comman|ders with three thousand Soldiers, besides all the Magistrates and Commonalty come to meet and receive him three Leagues from the Metropolis, where he is to keep his Court.</P>
<P>The second <HI>Tutang,</HI> who is of no less Power, but stays but one year in his Employment, is call'd <HI>Chayven.</HI> He is much respected and feared, for he takes an account of all manner of Business, Military or Civil, Condemns or Re|prieves Malefactors, and also looks after the Emperor's Revenue: He Exa|mines all the Magistrates, nay the <HI>Tutang</HI> himself, and hath also Power to pu|nish Judges, and put great and mean <HI>Mandarins</HI> out of their Employments: The Miscarriages of the grand <HI>Mandarins</HI> he informs the Emperor of by Letters, and puts them out of their Places till he hath receiv'd an Answer from his Majesty. He also pronounces the Sentences of Death which are given in all Places of the Province, and appoints for that purpose the Day and Town whi|ther all the Malefactors must be carry'd, that he may know the number and Names of them, and marks six or seven with a Pencil, and if more, he is ac|counted a blood-thirsty and tyrannous Man. Those that are thus mark'd are Executed in the Field, and the other carry'd again to Prison. He is also to look after the repairing of the City Walls, Castles and other Structures. He never
<PB N="407" REF="246">
goes out but with a great Train, that carry Court Badges, and other marks of severity.</P>
<P>There is yet sometime another Extraordinary <HI>Chayven,</HI> made at the Em|presses Request. He hath an absolute Power, but it extends no farther than to Pardon or Reprieve; for he Visits all the Prisons in the whole Province, sets those Prisoners at Liberty which for petty Crimes lie there, and have no Ad|versaries; and likewise such as are not able to free themselves. He Pleads in all desperate Causes, and assists People that are helpless; recalls a rashly pro|nounc'd Sentence, and is defender of the Poor. In short, his whole Office and Employment extends to Mercy. For which reason these Magistrates are du|ring their time of Government much respected by the common People.</P>
<P>The third Employment is <HI>Treasurer,</HI> who takes care of the Emperor's Re|venue in his Province, being Employ'd by the Court of Exchequer, which sit at the Emperor's Palace. He hath two Councellors allow'd him, one of which sits on his right, and the other on his left Hand, besides twenty six <HI>Mandarins,</HI> and several other Officers. His Business is to look after the Customs, Farms, and all Revenues whatsoever belonging to the Crown. He Seals the Weights and Measures, decides all Differences concerning Moneys, punishing the guilty, or sending them (if he think fit) to higher Courts, pays the Magistrates, Al|lies to the Emperor, Commanders and Soldiers, provides Liveries and Marks of Honor which are given to famous Scholars, pays the Money for the repair|ing of High-ways, Bridges, Courts or Palaces of the chief <HI>Mandarins,</HI> and Ships of War. Lastly, this Treasurer hath the Command of all what comes in or goes out of the Treasury. He also receives the Emperor's Presents from the Judges, Governors, and <HI>Tauli,</HI> which every one makes according to their Employ|ments, being in Silver Coin or Bullion, all which is by him melted into Bars, each to the value of fifty Crowns, and stamp'd with the Imperial Mark and the Melter's Name, that thereby he may know whom to accuse, if the Silver should be falsifi'd. In this manner it is carry'd into the Emperor's Treasury.</P>
<P>The fourth Court is call'd <HI>Gandchasci,</HI> that is, <HI>The Court of Life and Death.</HI> In<NOTE PLACE="marg">Something&punc; like our Judges of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">yer</HI> and <HI>Termi|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">er.</HI></NOTE> it are two Assistants, or <HI>Tauli,</HI> whose care is to Visit, and go from Town to Town to decide all Differences, punish the guilty, perform o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">r Duties be|longing to their Offices, which extend over the <HI>Militia,</HI> and Affairs, in such Pro|vinces that lie near the Sea.</P>
<P>The fifth resembles a Colledge of Learned Men, ordain'd to Examine<NOTE PLACE="marg">Like our Visitation o the Clergy or Heraldry.</NOTE> Youths how they profit in their Studies, and especially to observe their Masters of Art till such time as they have receiv'd their Bonnet and Orders to be Dire|ctors. The prime of this famous Society is a Chancellor, who from time to time goes to Towns and Villages to enquire after the Carriage, Deportment and Conversation of the Learned, and to punish or chastise them according to their several Offenses.</P>
<P>There are yet two Persons in every City call'd <HI>Hioquon,</HI> that is, <HI>Mandarins,</HI> or <HI>Magistrates of Knowledge,</HI> which also belong to the fore-mention'd five Courts, whose Command extends onely over the Students of the City: and though they have not Power to give the Degrees due to deserving Persons, but onely to chastise them, yet nevertheless they are very strict and severe, because they continually reside in one Place, and like Proctors in our Universities, come and Examine the Scholars.</P>
<P>All these fore-mention'd Courts Command over the whole Province, and the Cities, Towns and Villages contain'd therein.</P>
<P><PB N="408" REF="247">Moreover, every City hath peculiar Governors as here in <HI>Europe,</HI> being four eminent <HI>Mandarins,</HI> or Aldermen, as one of them is like a Mayor, which is by them call'd <HI>Chifu; Chi</HI> signifies <HI>Lord,</HI> or <HI>Governor,</HI> and <HI>Fu, A Mannor,</HI> or <HI>Tract of Land;</HI> the other three are his Assistants, and call'd <HI>Tumchu, Tumphuon,</HI> and <HI>Cheuquon;</HI> every one hath his pecular Court and Officers.</P>
<P>Besides these are nineteen lesser Magistrates, which look after the Towns: two of them have a prime Councellor and four inferior Assistants; the other nine onely one Councellor and one Assistant; the other eight have one supream Head, who Commands over their whole Society.</P>
<P>The Villages have also each of them a Judge and three Justices; the Judge is call'd <HI>Chihien,</HI> the first Justice <HI>Honchin,</HI> the second <HI>Chufu,</HI> and the third <HI>Tunfu:</HI> All these have their several Courts, or Council-Chambers, and likewise Secre|taries, Clerks, and other inferior Officers. The Judge may pronounce Sen|tence of Death, but cannot execute it.</P>
<P>Beside these <HI>Mandarins</HI> which reside in Towns and Villages, there are some which have neither power to Condemn nor Punish, but onely to give their Judgments to the Society.</P>
<P>The great Castles that lie distant from Towns and Villages, have also <HI>Man|darins,</HI> or Magistrates, chosen from amongst the Clerks; for the least Office that any Person of Quality aims at, is to be Judge or Justice in a Village.</P>
<P><HI>Trigaut</HI> declares the General Government of every Province, as it was in his time, after the following manner.</P>
<P>The Towns which belong to the prime Provinces of <HI>Peking</HI> and <HI>Nanking,</HI> are Govern'd after the same manner as all the Cities and Towns in the other Provinces. The Government of each of the thirteen Provinces consists in a Magistrate call'd <HI>Pucinsu,</HI> and another nam'd <HI>Nanganzasu;</HI> the first determines Civil Causes, and the other Criminal: They keep their Courts in great State, and reside in the Metropolis of the Province. To both these belong several petty Officers, and also the chief Magistrates, which are call'd <HI>Tauli;</HI> but be|cause they Command over several Cities they are sometimes absent from the Metropolis.</P>
<P>Every <HI>Fu</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">r County (for a Province is divided into divers Counties) hath a peculiar Governor call'd <HI>Chifu,</HI> that is, <HI>Lord of the County;</HI> and likewise over every great City, or <HI>Cheu,</HI> and over each Town, or <HI>Hien,</HI> is a Governor, the first call'd <HI>Chicheu,</HI> and the last <HI>Cihien.</HI></P>
<P>These Governors of all the Counties, and chief Rulers of Cities, have every one four Assistants, which aid them in all Businesses that happen in their Ju|risdiction, being all their Deputies.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chifu,</HI> or Governor of the County, hath his Residence in one of the Ci|ties, and determineth all things as Chief; for when any Businesses are consult|of by the <HI>Chicheu</HI> and <HI>Cihien,</HI> they acquaint him therewith as their Superior, and in the first Degree.</P>
<P>It is to be observ'd, that the <HI>Chifu,</HI> or Governors of the Territories, and his Court, and the whole County receive their Denomination from the City in which they reside: as for example, the Governor keeps his Court in the City <HI>Nunciang,</HI> and that City gives denomination to the whole County, Governor and Court, so that they are call'd <HI>Nunciangers.</HI></P>
<P>But because an account must be given of the Government of every peculiar Province to the Court at <HI>Peking,</HI> therefore they Commission two other besides the fore-mention'd Magistrates to every Province from the Imperial City, to Su|pervisor
<PB N="409" REF="247">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
to the rest: one of them resides constantly in the Province, and is call'd <HI>Tutam;</HI> the other is yearly sent from the Court, and nam'd <HI>Ciayven.</HI> The Command of the first being great over all the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> Magistrates, Subjects, <HI>Militia,</HI> and other grand Concerns, may be compar'd to the <HI>European</HI> Vice-Roys. The last resembles a Commissioner of Enquiry; yet by the Emperor's Com|mands he hath an Eye over the Business of the whole Province, viewing of Cities and Castles, Examines all Magistrates, punisheth the meanest, informs the Emperor of the Misdemeanors of the Grandees, and after what manner every one officiates his Place, and is the onely Person amongst all the Magi|strates in the Province that pronounces Sentence of Death; he is fear'd and respected by every one.</P>
<P>Besides these Magistrates, there are many others in Cities, Towns and Vil|lages, as also many Generals and Collonels through the whole Empire, but especially in Places bordering the Sea, and Garisons. Thus far <HI>Trigaut.</HI></P>
<P>All the Magistrates (saith the same <HI>Trigaut</HI>) are under nine Orders; all com|prehended under the Philosopher and Military Man. Every one in these Orders receives his Revenue from the publick Stock either in Rice or Mony, though but little in respect of their Authority; for the Salary of the prime and chief Order amounts not to above a thousand <HI>Ducats</HI> yearly. Those which are of the same Order receive Wages alike, whether Philosophers or Military Persons; for the chief of the Soldiers get as much as the Supream of the Learned.</P>
<P>All the Magistrates have a private Seal of their Office, given them by the<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mandarins</HI> Seal.</NOTE> Emperor <HI>Humvu.</HI> What they write in their Law they Seal onely with Red, which is a kind of Earth, so Red, that it is like a Vermilion, and digg'd out of the Mountain <HI>Tape,</HI> near the City <HI>Lingkien</HI> in the Province of <HI>Xanso.</HI> This Mark the <HI>Mandarins</HI> keep with great care, for upon the loss of it they are not onely put out of their Employments, but severely punish'd; wherefore when e're they go out they carry it with them in a Box, or Cabinet, Lockt up and Seal'd, which they never suffer to be out of their sights.</P>
<P><PB N="410" REF="248">There is an excellent harmony, as <HI>Trigaut</HI> witnesseth, betwixt the superior and inferior Magistrates, and between the Governors and Privy-Council, and other Grandees and the Emperor; which they not onely manifest by their rea|diness in obeying him, but also by outward appearance: for they never neg|lect their usual Visits at certain times, nor the Ceremony of Presenting. Nei|ther do the meaner Magistrates speak with the higher before the Bench, or else|where, but upon their bended Knees, and with peculiar Reverence. The same Ceremony the Subjects use to the Governors of their Cities, notwithstanding they know that they never took their Degrees in Learning, and before their entrance to be Magistrates were chosen from amongst the meanest of the Com|monalty.</P>
<P>All <HI>Chineses,</HI> if they follow any honorable Employment, though they are <HI>Mandarins,</HI> put on the Bonnet of their Office when they will speak, shew Reve|rence, or appear before any of a higher Quality; for to come without, would be accounted uncivil.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mandarins</HI> Stools are round like Chirurgeons Chairs, the Back and Arms thereof cover'd with a Tygers Skin, or some other Beast. Their Beards are also set after the same manner, as may appear in the Sculp, wearing them very thin, and letting them grow down without either Clipping or Shaving their Mustacho's hanging downwards; they also shoot forth close by their Ears, but grow not down to their Lips, nor under their Chin, but most fre|quently with three Whiskers on each side, and one underneath.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mandarins</HI> and other Grandees, nay the Emperor himself, let their Nails grow long, which they account no small sign of Gentility and Ornament. Some Ladies, because they would not break them, wear little Cases over them.</P>
<P>None of the Magistrates Officiate above three years in a publick Employ|ment, except he be new Commission'd by the Emperor, but is generally pro|moted to a higher Dignity. This is done because none should get too many Friends, or gain too much upon the Hearts of the People, in dependency of which he might practise against the State, as it hath often hapned.</P>
<P>The chiefest Governors of the Provinces, Counties and Cities, as the <HI>Pucin|fu, Naganzafu, Cifu, Ciceu, Cihien,</HI> and the like, must every three years, according to the Emperor's Order, appear at the Court in <HI>Peking,</HI> and there shew Reve|rence and Obeisance to the Emperor.</P>
<P>At the same time a general Muster is made at the Court of all the Magi|strates, which through the whole Realm are plac'd in the several Provinces, as well of those that are there present as of those that are absent, where a strict Enquiry is made of their Behavior: From which Enquiry they conclude whom to depose, whom to promote, and whom to punish, without regarding or re|specting of Persons; and the Emperor himself cannot alter any thing resolv'd on by the fore-mention'd Judges in this general Scrutiny.</P>
<P>Those that are to be punish'd are not the meanest, nor the fewest, but some|times to the number of four thousand, whose Names are set down in a Book, which is afterwards Printed and publish'd to the whole Empire. Moreover, the Condemned are, according to <HI>Trigaut,</HI> divided into five Parties, or accord|ing to <HI>Semedo,</HI> the chiefest Misdemeanors for which the <HI>Mandarins</HI> are punish'd, are chiefly seven: The first contains the Covetous, which have violated the Law by Bribes, and defrauded the Commonalty, and appropriated the Lands, Goods or Chattels of their Subjects unjustly to themselves: for which Offence they are not onely bereav'd of their Employments for ever, but also all the
<PB N="411" REF="248">
Marks and Priviledges of Magistracy. Amongst the second are reckon'd such as have not punish'd the Criminals according to their desert, but conniv'd for favor or affection: these are also bereav'd of their Places, Liveries and Privi|ledges. The third are very aged People, and those that are too negligent and slothful in their Offices; for which they lose their Employments, yet not their Marks and Priviledges. Amongst the fourth are reckon'd those which are heedless and hasty, pronouncing Sentence without any consideration, and go unadvisedly about publick Affairs: these are put into meaner Offices, or else sent to such Places in the Realm which are suppos'd to be of a more easie Go|vernment. Amongst the last are those which Govern others and their own Families indiscreetly, and live debauch'd, contrary to the gravity of Magi|strates: these are bereav'd of their Office and Quality for ever.</P>
<P>The same Examination is also perform'd with the Magistrate at the Court but once every year: And after the same manner, and at the same time with great strictness the Officers of the Soldiers are likewise Muster'd.</P>
<P>None in the whole Realm is Commission'd to Rule in that Province where|in he was born, except onely Military Officers: This is done because the first should not favor their Friends or Relations; but the last out of a love to their native Countrey should defend it more carefully.</P>
<P>When any Lord Serves as Magistrate, none of his Sons or Servants may go out of the House, make Visits, Converse with any Persons, or Treat about any Business, for fear they should be suspected to take Bribes; but he is attend|ed by Servants given to all Magistrates upon the publick Account. When he goes out himself, he Seals the Doors (either of publick or private Houses, wherein Justice is administred) with a Seal, that none of the Houshold can come out without his knowledge.</P>
<P>The whole Realm in the time of the <HI>Chineses</HI> was Govern'd by Philoso|phers; to whom all the Soldiers and Commanders shew'd great Reverence, and a peculiar Ceremony and Respect. Of these Philosophers consisted the chief Council of War, their Designs and Contrivances being better respected by the Emperor than those of the <HI>Militia</HI> Officers, which seldom or never were call'd to Council: Wherefore none that were of a noble Mind and respected, concern'd themselves about Warlike Affairs, but rather endeavor'd to have the least Degree in the Council of Philosophers, than to be the greatest Comman|der in Martial Concerns; the Philosophers enjoying the greater Estates, and being held in much higher esteem by the People. But since the <HI>Tartars</HI> Conquest of <HI>China,</HI> the Military Affairs are in greater Request, and the <HI>Chineses</HI> exercise them|selves so much in Arms with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> that they lay aside their Learning.</P>
<P>Very strictly they observe the Governors and Commanders; for besides the <HI>Tauli</HI> and <HI>Quauli,</HI> which according to their Offices take cognisance of all Trans|actions, and inform the Emperor thereof. Every Province hath a peculiar Vi|sitor, which is to punish or accuse Offenders.</P>
<P>The Emperor retrenches all his Officers Charges, by which he bereaves them of the opportunity of making Parties, and running into Debt. So soon as any one receives a Commission for Employment, when he goes to take possession of it, all Charges for his Person, Servants and Family, besides those of his Jour|ney, as well by Water as by Land, (under which are reckon'd Vessels, Wagons, Horses, Men, and all the rest of the Retinue) are paid out of the Emperor's privy Purse. He goes into no Inn all the Way which he passes, but Palaces are made ready in the Towns and Villages, with all Necessaries, in which he takes

gaping Mouthes; one hath two Horns on the Crown of his Head, with Ears and Hair like those of a Hog, with their Hands ty'd together in a Praying posture, for both are said to be Servants to <HI>Hoaquan;</HI> the other, which hath no Horns on his Head, but one which behind turns with a sharp Point, holds in his right Hand a Pike or Lance, with a Serpent wound about the top of it.</P>
<P>Above on the left side of <HI>Hoaquan</HI> appears a Dragon, as it were flying out from the Clouds; besides, all manner of horrid Representations stand either at the Entrance of the Temple, or behind the Images.</P>
<P>Another Idol call'd <HI>Vitek,</HI> and by others <HI>Ninifo,</HI> whom they suppose to have been a very wise Man, the <HI>Chineses</HI> honor with peculiar Reverence and bended Knees, which is perform'd by the grandest <HI>Mandarins,</HI> placing his Image on the Altars in the Temples, with burning Lamps and Perfuming-pans round about him. The Idol, a deformed Monster, is often represented after that manner, as appears by the inserted Sculp, with his Breast bare, a very great Head, large Teats, and Tun-belly, the left hand holding a Garland, and great Iron Rings in the Ears, from whence, they say, the use of Ear-rings came first into <HI>China.</HI> Other Images are made sitting with their Legs across under them, after the Eastern manner: Some pick their Ears with an Ear-picker, under which they hide a great Mystery; others with a Tool like a Curry-Comb, scrape their Shoulders and Necks; all which the <HI>Chineses,</HI> especially the vulgar, wor|ship for great Saints, and Offer Perfumes, Meat, and several other things to them.</P>
<P>The Priests of this Sect are call'd <HI>Ociams</HI> or <HI>Hoxons,</HI> which against the Cu|stom<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trigan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"></NOTE> of the Countrey continually shave their Beards and Hair, but go Cloth'd like others, differing in nothing but their Bonnets: Some wander like <HI>Men|dicants</HI> up and down the Countrey, asking Alms; others live like Recluses in the Recesses of Rocks and Mountains, where they suffer hard Penance; others<NOTE PLACE="marg">Semedo.</NOTE> in publick make narrow Chambers of Boards, struck full of Nails on all sides with the Points inwards, in which they lock themselves for a whole Moneth,

and stand without Supporters; some promise to eat no Flesh, but drink onely <HI>Cha</HI> or <HI>Tee,</HI> into which they put Balls made of Beef and dry'd in the Sun before they drink it. There are others of this Sect that belong to no Cloysters, nor are receiv'd into them as Guests but onely for one day, being Exiles, Vaga|bonds<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trigaut.</NOTE> and Robbers: But the greatest part of them, being to the number of two or three Millions, live in the Cloysters of the Temples, and are maintain'd by the Revenues allow'd them of old by the Emperors that were liberal Be|nefactors to their Fraternity; nevertheless they endeavor by one thing or other to maintain themselves: They despise (according to <HI>Semedo</HI>) a Marry'd Life, living five or six hundred cloyster'd together. They also live (saith he) very strictly, eating neither Fish nor Eggs, nor drink Wine. These beg Alms, Sing, and perform peculiar Ceremonies and Prayers against Fire, Tempests, com|mon Calamities, and sudden Death: In which Services they wear onely a Hood and Fan.</P>
<P>These Priests are accounted the meanest of the People, and Raff of the whole Empire, because they are all Extracted from the Vulgar: for in their Infancy being sold as Servants to the <HI>Osiams,</HI> they become Scholars, and succeed their Tutors in their Office and Service, an Invention found out by them to advance themselves; for there is never any found, that of his own free will, resolving to live a holy Life, that will go into the Cloysters amongst such Company.</P>
<P>Through Ignorance and ill Breeding the Slave-Pupils seldom improve themselves beyond their Tutors, but are just the same in their whole Demea|nor; and as by Nature we have a propensity to Vice, not being cultivated, so they from time to time degenerate, growing worse; wherefore they learn no Morality, nor attain to the knowledge of Literature, except accidentally some, though very few, which naturally inclin'd to Learning, endeavor the same by their own Industry. Notwithstanding they have no Wives, they are so inclin'd to the Female Sex, that they cannot be kept from conversing with
<PB N="584" REF="252">
common Strumpets but by great punishments, <HI>viz.</HI> those that attempt it are, if taken in the Act, burnt with a hot Iron through the Neck or Leg, in which they put an Iron Chain of eight or ten Fathom long, besides great Shackles; in which manner the Offender must walk naked along the Streets till he hath begg'd ten <HI>Tail</HI> of Silver for the benefit of his Cloyster: And that he may per|form this Penance, one of his Fraternity goes along with him, and with a Whip severely draws Blood from his naked Skin: The Chain by reason of its great weight is also so troublesom to his Wound, that Blood and Corruption gushes out of it. Others are for several days put into little Houses like our Cages, driven full of Nails with the Points inward, wherein the Offender not being able to lie down, is forc'd to stand upright, without either Meat or Drink.</P>
<P>The Cloysters of these <HI>Osciams</HI> are built in Inclosures according to every ones bigness: every Inclosure hath a constant Treasurer or Governor, whom his Scholars which he hath bought for his Servants (whereof he hath as many as he will or can maintain) succeed as by Inheritance.</P>
<P>They acknowledge no Superior in these Cloysters; and every one erects as many Huts or Booths in his appointed Apartment as he can, which is customary through the whole Empire, yet chiefly in the Metropolis of <HI>Peking.</HI> The Cells when built they Let to their great advantage, to Strangers which come thither to Trade, which makes these Cloysters rather seem publick Inns than Places of Sanctity, regarding nothing less than the worshipping of Idols, or teaching that wicked Doctrine.</P>
<P>Though the Condition of the Inhabitants of these Cloysters is mean and despicable, yet nevertheless they are by many hir'd for a small Reward to per|form Funeral Ceremonies, and some other such like Offices.</P>
<P>Now at present this Doctrine is not a little come into request again, many Temples being erected for the same. All the Followers thereof are either Eunuchs, Women, or ignorant People. Yet besides these there are some which boast themselves the prime Maintainers of this Doctrine, and are call'd <HI>Ciaicum,</HI> that is, <HI>Abstinentiaries,</HI> for they refrain in their Houses all their Life|times from eating either Flesh or Fish, and reverently worship with Offerings and Prayers a row of Images, and sometime are sent for to their Neighbors Houses to Pray with them.</P>
<P>The Women, separated from the Men, maintain this retir'd Life in Cloy|sters, and shaving the Hair from the Crown of their Heads, despise Marriage. The <HI>Chineses</HI> call them <HI>Nicu,</HI> which signifies <HI>A Nun;</HI> but not many of them live together, and are far less in number than the Men. Thus far <HI>Trigaut.</HI></P>
<P>These Cloysters (according to <HI>Semedo</HI>) are very large; the Walls which sur|round them makes them seem like a City, divided into Streets, open places, and inhabited Houses, in each of which two or three have their Residences, <HI>viz.</HI> a Master and his Scholars, which are sufficiently provided for; and also all the Houses receive an equal proportion of the Emperor's Allowance.</P>
<P>The Governor of the Cloyster, who hath the general Command over all, takes no cognisance but of peculiar Businesses which are brought before him; and what concerns other things, and the Government of their Houses, he leaves to themselves. Yet nevertheless he gives Offices, and Titles to those that are to receive Strangers, whoe're he be that comes to see their Cloysters, and beat on a Drum that stands at the Gate; they are oblig'd to go before him to the number of thirty in their Ceremonial Habit: Coming to him they Sa|lute

him, and walk before him to the Place where he desires to be; which they do again at his Return. They are under the Jurisdiction of the <HI>Council of Customs;</HI> but upon the Executing of Punishments, when deserv'd, they are us'd more favourably than when Tri'd by the common Law.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Semedo.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Disciples or Followers of this Doctrine, which at this Day are in great numbers, live together, never Marry, let the Hair of their Head and Beards grow very long, and wear ordinary Clothes, which differ little from the other in fashion, except in one thing, which shews that they are in Service; for in stead of a Bonnet they wear a little Garland, which covers just the Crown of their Heads. They account the last and greatest Good of Mankind to consist in bodily Goods, and the enjoyment of a quiet and peaceable Life, without toyl or trouble; They acknowledge two Deities, the one more powerful than the other; They allow one Paradice and a Hell: the Paradice, which (ac|cording to their saying is joyn'd to the satisfaction of the Body) is not onely for another Life, but also for this on Earth, and consists herein, that by means of a certain Exercise and Obedience, some that are old may become young Children; others may make themselves <HI>Xinsien,</HI> that is, <HI>Happy on Earth,</HI> to pos|sess what they please speedily with a wish, flie from one place to another, though very remote, and go to Feasts, and the like. They are lovers of Mu|sick, and use several Instruments; on which account they are invited to Fune|rals and publick Solemnities, and serve the Emperor and <HI>Mandarins</HI> in making their Offerings; They boast themselves to be Soothsayers, and promise to pro|cure Rain, and clear Houses haunted by Spirits.</P>
<P>All the <HI>Chineses</HI> are strangely inclin'd to Superstition, but especially the Fol|lowers of this second Sect, and give great credit to Sorcery, and Predictions of future things.</P>
<P>The Emperor's Astronomers (according to <HI>Semedo</HI>) do not a little uphold this Superstition, because they foreshew ensuing Events from the colour of the Heavens and tempestuous Weather, Thunder out of Season, by several aspects of the Sun, which they reckon to be twenty two, and from sixteen other Appearances; with all which they acquaint the Emperor: And they chiefly employ their time in foretelling either Peace or War; as also Sicknesses, Death, Changes, Insurrections, and the like: to which purpose they make Almanacks, or yearly Prognostications, which are divided into Moons, and the Moons again into Days, the Days into fortunate or unfortunate Hours, either to undertake any thing or let it alone, as to go a Journey, remove out of a House, Marry, bury the Dead, build Houses, and the like.</P>
<P>By this manner of Cheating the <HI>Chineses</HI> are so deluded, and so strictly do<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin&punc; Hist. Sinic.</NOTE> they follow these Observations, that they govern themselves wholly thereby; for if the Almanack commands to do any thing on such a Day, though all the Elements were against it, they will not neglect it.</P>
<P>These Astronomers, according to a very ancient Custom, are punish'd with Death, if they through neglect do not foretell the Eclipse of the Sun and Moon, or accidentally commit any mistakes in their Prognostication: for the <HI>Chineses</HI> account it a deadly sin not to assist the Sun or Moon when they are darkned, with Offerings and beating of Drums, and other noise, fearing else they would be devour'd by a Dog or Dragon: wherefore the Emperor in|form'd by People experienc'd in the Course of the Heavens, of the approach|ing Darkness, immediately sends Messengers Post through all the Cities of the Empire to give notice of the Day and Hour on which the Eclipse will hap|pen:
<PB N="586" REF="253">
whereupon the Magistrates and Citizens carefully watch for the time, and prevent the threatning danger by beating on divers tinkling and Copper Basons.</P>
<P>They have Temples that are drawn or Carriages made for that purpose, in which the Women deliver out their Almanacks; wherein a Receipt is written how they may Conceive.</P>
<P><HI>Trigaut</HI> saith, that no superstitious Custom hath spread it self so far through the whole Empire, as that in the observation of fortunate and unfortunate Days and Hours; so that the <HI>Chineses</HI> in all their Actions observe the time exactly: To which purpose two sorts of Almanacks are Printed every year, which upon the Emperor's Command are dispersed through the whole Em|pire, which makes the Fallacy the more believ'd.</P>
<P>These annual Prognostications are sold in such abundance, that most Houses have them: In them they find what they too punctually observe, not onely the critical Days, but the precise Hours and Minutes at what time they shall begin or desist in any Negotiation or Business whatsoever. Besides, these Writers of the annual Predictions go higher, Composing for their profit Books more puzling and mysterious, with large Comments on the good and evil Days, with more accurate Directions, especially concerning Buildings, Marriages, or Travel, and the like Business of consequence; and though it often happens that the Weather fall out tempestuous, let it Thunder and Lighten, Blow or Rain, yet they will begin, though they make never so little progress.</P>
<P><HI>Nasirodin,</HI> a <HI>Persian</HI> Author, who flourish'd <HI>Anno</HI> 1265. tells us, that the <HI>Chi|neses,</HI> by him call'd <HI>Katayans,</HI> have a Circle of twelve Days, which according to the Instruction of the Astronomers, they use in chusing the time to under|take or delay any Business of consequenc.</P>
<P>These twelve Days are by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd as followeth:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Ching,</HI> that is, Perfecting.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Xeu,</HI> that is, Receiving.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Cai,</HI> that is, Opening.</ITEM>

<ITEM><HI>Chu,</HI> that is, Dividing.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Muen,</HI> that is, Exchanging.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Ping,</HI> that is, Making even.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Four of these twelve Days are call'd <HI>He,</HI> that is <HI>Black,</HI> and are accounted unfortunate; four <HI>Hoang,</HI> that is, <HI>Yellow,</HI> which are lucky, and promise some good; two <HI>Hoen,</HI> that is, <HI>Brown and Dark,</HI> and esteem'd ominous.</P>
<P>Others undertake to tell Fortunes by even and odd Numbers, and with white or black Representations of Men and Beasts, which they alter sixty four times to please the liberal Inquisitor. Some (after our manner) pick Pockets by Calculating Nativities, and from thence tell the Fortune that shall attend a Man in his whole Life; Others wheedle them out of their Money, by Phi|siognomy and Palmestry, and such Gipsie-like tricks; others by Dreams; some from certain words which they observe in speaking; divers from the shape of the Body, or sitting of a Person, and an innumerable many actions more. Others go farther, selling the Winds, and fair or foul Weather, and take upon them the Dominion of the floating Element; for when any Mer|chants have Ships at Sea, or some ready to set Sail, they address themselves to
<PB N="587" REF="253">

these, who live on the Shores or Banks of the Rivers, that they may have a speedy and safe Voyage. They generally reside two and two together, as you may see by this Sculp; one sits on a Bench betwixt two great Bun|dles of Rushes, wearing a flat Cap on his Head, and on his Body a wide Coat, carelesly folded about him, in his left Hand a Book, in which Reading he mutters a considerable time. Next him sits his Companion on two Fish-Baskets, likewise with a flat Cap, and the upper part of his Body almost naked, behind over his right Shoulder hangs a blown-up Bag, out of which he lets as much Wind as any one is minded to purchase; in his left Hand he holds a great Mallet, with which he strikes several times hard on the Ground, that the Spi|rit of the Winds, (who, as they make them believe, appears in the Air, sitting on a great Bird in the shape of a Man, with a broad brimm'd Hat and a wide Coat) may descend. But this Fancy is not so much practis'd of late.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> agreed herein with the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and most of it is at this day us'd amongst them: one thing there is which may properly be said to be the <HI>Chineses;</HI> it consists in the chusing of Land to build private or publick Structures upon, or bury the Dead in, chusing it by the likeness of the Head, Tail and Feet of several Dragons, which they suppose to live under Ground, and believe, that on them the welfare, not onely of Families, but also of Ci|ties, Provinces, and the whole Empire depends.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> account one Dragon, whom they call <HI>Lung,</HI> for the greatest fore-runner of good Luck.</P>
<P>Before the time of the Family of <HI>Hia,</HI> nay, the Emperor <HI>Fohi,</HI> who began his Reign <HI>Anno</HI> 2952. before the Birth of <HI>Christ,</HI> it is said, That a Dragon was seen flying from a Pool; and to make the Business seem of greater conse|quence and consideration, they added, That they had observ'd sixty four Marks or Characters on his Back, which, according to their Sages, have my|sterious significations.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> in a manner ascribe all things to a Dragon, and believe, that
<PB N="588" REF="254">
not onely all humane Fortune, but also Rain, Hail, Thunder and Lightning, are as that Monster orders. They also affirm, That there is a Dragon under the Earth, but chiefly under the Mountains; and this is the reason why with such great Care and Charge they observe the parts of the Dragon in the making of their Graves; for according to the goodness of the Earth they value the Riches and Fortune of the whole Family; just as the Astronomers, from the Conjunction of several Planets, prognosticate future Events. For this reason also the <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperors bear a Dragon in their Arms, as the <HI>Romans</HI> an Eagle; nay, the Emperor's Apparel is Embroider'd with Dragons, and like|wise on all the Furniture for his Table and whole House is Engraven the same; nay, the whole Court is every where full of painted Dragons.</P>
<P>But above all it is to be admir'd, that the <HI>Chineses</HI> paint five Claws at the Feet of the Emperor's Dragons. None but those who are of Imperial Blood, or peculiar Favourites of the Emperor, may bear a Dragon in his Coat of Arms: yet if others do use this same Bearing, they must on pain of Death not give above four Claws.</P>
<P>They say that the Foam of a Dragon impregnated one of the Emperor <HI>Ie</HI>'s Concubines without the use of a Man: which Fable the <HI>Chineses</HI> thus relate:</P>
<P><Q>In the time of the Family of <HI>Hia</HI> (say they) a Dragon was seen, which vanish'd on a sudden, and left a Froth on the Earth: This Froth being of a Dragon, was like a costly, nay, that which is more, a holy Relick, and lock'd up in a golden Coffer, and preserv'd till the Reign of the Emperor <HI>Siveni;</HI> when afterward at his Command, without knowing wherefore, the Chest was open'd, and this Slime leap'd forth as if it had been living, and ran to and again through the Palace, none being able to hold it, and at last got into the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and there divirginated one of great Beauty, kept for the Emperor; from hence, after the full time (as the <HI>Chineses</HI> relate) she was deliver'd of a fair Female: The Mother fearing to gain an ill Name, and the Emperor's displeasure, laid down the Infant, which two Marry'd Peo|ple, that accidentally walk'd by there, hearing it cry, took up, and carrying it home, brought it up as their own Child.</Q></P>
<P>In the third Year of the Emperor <HI>Ie</HI>'s Reign the fore-mention'd Infant being grown Marriagable, her Foster-father was on some occasion accus'd of a certain Crime, and put in Prison: whereupon he proffering the Virgin (who was endu'd with incomparable Beauty) for his Ransom to the Emperor, was not onely released, but return'd home with great Riches. But the Em|peror was so strangely surpris'd with the exceeding Beauty of his new Mistris, that he was in a manner distracted, and forsook the lawful Empress, and his Son born by her, and took <HI>Paosua</HI> (for so the Virgin was call'd) for his Spouse, and elected <HI>Pefo,</HI> the Son of <HI>Paosua,</HI> in stead of <HI>Ikie,</HI> the lawful Son of the Empress, to succeed him in the Throne, against the consent of all his Substitute Governors.</P>
<P><HI>Ikie</HI> the true Heir, being enrag'd by the great wrong which he had suffer'd, fled from his Father to his Uncle King <HI>Xin,</HI> in the South part of the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> at the place where the City <HI>Nanyang</HI> stands at this day.</P>
<P><HI>Paosua</HI> during this time dwelt with the Emperor in all prosperity; but one thing he observ'd, that he never saw her Laugh, which was very unpleasing to him; therefore he try'd several ways to win a Smile from her. At the same time a Difference arising, and overtures and threatnings of War being betwixt him and the <HI>Tartars,</HI> he put his <HI>Militia</HI> in a posture of Defence; which done,
<PB N="589" REF="254">
and to teach them Alarms, he fir'd his Beacons when there was no need: whereupon the Palaces, and all places every where were throng'd with the gather'd Soldiers; which too often repeating, and no appearance of any Enemy, gave her occasion to laugh heartily, to the great joy of the fond Emperor: Which false Alarms being so commonly, when they came to be real, and not being believ'd, brought on that negligent carelesness in not obeying, that it lost him his Life and Empire.</P>
<P>Amongst other things also, <HI>Paosua</HI> took great delight in the noise which Silk makes when torn by force; wherefore the Emperor to recreate her, always spent his time in her Presence, with tearing and rending of Silk.</P>
<P>Mean while the Emperor sent a Party to King <HI>Xin</HI> to fetch his fled Son again; but <HI>Xin</HI> refus'd to deliver the Prince, unless he should be declar'd Heir to the Empire: The Emperor enrag'd thereat, march'd with an Army against <HI>Xin;</HI> who unequal to the Emperor, yet of greater Policy, joyn'd with the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and in the Night falls suddenly on the Emperor's Quarters: where|upon the Beacons being fir'd as before, the Soldiers seeing the Flame, suppos'd that the Emperor as formerly was onely caressing of his Empress, neglected their Duties; and therefore making no resistance, most of them were taken sleeping by the Enemy, and the Emperor himself slain by his Brother and Son.</P>
<P>But to return; As <HI>Trigaut</HI> tells us, several eminent Persons Study this My.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trigaut.</NOTE> stery of Dragon-Knowledge, and are sent for from remote Places to advise withal when publick Buildings are to be erected, that they may so lay their Platform suting with the benevolent Signatures from the posture of the Dra|gon, that the Edifice may for ever after be more free from Casualties: for these Astronomers, as our Astrologers, observe the good and evil Aspects of the Planets, with the several Configurations of the fixed Stars, so they take their Marks from the situation of Mountains and Rivers, and whatever else makes a variety, that signifies good success, on which they say, not onely the preservation of the House, but the welfare and Honor of the Family depends.</P>
<P><HI>Semedo</HI> calls these Surveyors <HI>Tili.</HI> <Q>Others (saith he) which they call <HI>Tili,</HI> endeavor to to observe, not onely the Situation of the Earth, but the Posi|tions of the Planetary Aspects in the celestial Houses, so to make more hap|py their terrestrial Habitations.</Q></P>
<P>It is a very ancient Custom, and us'd to this day, to take their Observations of good or ill success, from the Colour, Spots, Motions, Legs, and Shell of a Tortoise. And likewise, as the <HI>Augurs</HI> of old, from the Notes of Birds, and noise of Beasts, and also whate're they meet with in the Morning, the reflect|ing shadows of the Sun on peculiar Houses; for if at their going out in the Morning they meet any one in Mourning Apparel at their Door, <HI>Bonzies</HI> or the like, they look upon it as an ill Omen. In short, whatsoever inconvenience happens to peculiar Houses, Cities, Provinces, or the whole Empire, they ascribe it to their miserable Fortune, or something or other that is wrongly plac'd in the Houses, Towns, or the Emperors Palace.</P>
<P>All Streets, Shops and Markets, are full of these Astronomers, Surveyors, Soothsayers, Prognosticators, or in a word, Juglers and Deluders, promising good Fortune to all. Many of these are blind, and most of them poor People, yet notwithstanding they will still hearken to their cheating Fopperies. The blind Men run along the Streets playing on Pipes, but the Women beat on lit|tle Kettles, whereby they give notice to all those that will be cozen'd and
<PB N="590" REF="255">

</FIGURE>
know their Fortunes. Neither are obscure Hamlets onely full of these Delu|ders, but also great Cities and Courts of Grandees swarm with them; with which Practice onely some maintain themselves, keep brave Houses, and ga|ther great Riches; for High and Low, Noble and Ignoble, nay, the Emperor himself, and all the Magistrates respect them.</P>
<P>They say that some of these Fortune-tellers reside on desolate and solitary Mountains, between the Clefts of Rocks and barren Hills like Hermits; whi|ther also great numbers of People resort to know the Events of future things. Some onely write strange Characters and&punc; <HI>Chinese</HI> Letters on Boards, contain|ing the future Condition of the Enquirers; yet their promising oftentimes hath a double meaning.</P>
<P>These Wizards have many times horrible Toads that sit near them, with a thick gray speckled Skin, and opening their Jaws, (as they say) with their poisonous Breath blast and wither the Grass round about them.</P>
<P>These generally sit bare-headed, being close shaven, and with their Feet naked, picking their Ears whilst they mutter several words to themselves.</P>
<P>In the time of the Emperor <HI>Hiaou,</HI> who Reigned <HI>Anno</HI> 142. before the Nati|vity of <HI>Christ,</HI> many Women, especially at the Emperor's Court, Studied Ma|gick and Charms, by which making themselves to appear much fairer than they were, they subjected the Male Sex according to their pleasures. Of these some got into the Prince <HI>Guei</HI>'s Court, the Emperor's Son begotten by a lawful Wife, but without his knowledge, because he, according to the <HI>Chinese</HI> Wri|tings, was of a good and pious Nature: but attaining to years, he betook him|self, being ensnar'd by the fore-mention'd Charms, wholly to lasciviousness.</P>
<P>Amongst other things, they say there are certain Drugs, by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Kuan,</HI> which if the Powder thereof be given any Man to drink by a Woman, it makes them mad after them, like our Love-Powders: But they had worse Ingredients, with which they occasion'd Distempers, nay, Death on whom|soe're they pleas'd; by which means <HI>Li,</HI> the Emperor's Son, begotten by one
<PB N="591" REF="255">
of his Concubines, was kill'd in the nineteenth Year of his Age, together with his Wife, Children, and most of his Family, except one Nephew.</P>
<P>But the whole Empire is strangely besotted with the study of <HI>Alchymie,</HI> there|by<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">igaut.</NOTE> to get the <HI>Philosophers-Stone,</HI> by which they not only Inrich themselves by turning all things to Gold and Silver, but also that <HI>Elixar</HI> makes them <HI>Immor|tal,</HI> which many Emperors before and since the <HI>Nativity</HI> have endeavor'd to at|tain to.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> affirm, That there are Rules and Commandments of both these Arts, found out first by very Ancient, Learned, (which the <HI>Chineses</HI> reckon amongst their <HI>Saints</HI>) and afterwards from one to another, deliver'd to their Successors: They say also, that these first Inventors, after having&punc; perform'd many excellent and soveraign Works, ascend both with Soul and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> toge|ther to Heaven, when they began to grow weary living on Earth.</P>
<P>They also tell us, That anciently a Person liv'd without the Walls of the City <HI>Nanchang,</HI> which assisted many needy People, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ast p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ntiful&punc; Alms amongst the Poor, because he by the Art of <HI>Chymistry</HI> could make pure Silver. He also (say they) had by the help of Divine Arts, a Dragon, who threaten'd the Ruine of the City; after which, having Chain'd him to an Iron Column of an exceeding bigness, he, his whole House and Family ascended up to Hea|ven; For this reason, the Citizens out of a Superstition, erected a great Chap|pel for him; and the foremention'd Iron Column, the better to keep up the re|putation of the Fable, is there to be seen at this day.</P>
<P>But however they decline the converting of Metals into Gold or Silver by the <HI>Stone,</HI> yet the Emperor himself, and most Eminent Persons of the Empire, make it a great part of their business to study <HI>Immortality,</HI> from the promis'd Restauration of Youth, by the wonderful Operations of this <HI>Elixar:</HI> To which purpose, as there are many Students, so there is no want of Masters; and the whole City of <HI>Peking</HI> every where pester'd with their Laboratories; and though never so much deluded, yet fresh hopes carry them on with a fervent desire to bring their Work to Perfection; being perswaded by these <HI>Mountebanks,</HI> that their failings happen'd from some mistakes, but now, if they would begin again, they make no question, being since better inform'd, to finish the so long expected and happy Work.</P>
<P>But before we leave our <HI>Alchymists,</HI> take this from <HI>Martinius,</HI> which he tells of the Emperor <HI>Hiaou,</HI> who had not his equal amongst the <HI>Chineses,</HI> He was as their Histories say, much transported with a belief, that by this Art he might not onely be the Wealthiest, the Happiest, and the Greatest of all Princes, but also be Crown'd with Immortality: From hence he receiv'd the Title of <HI>Van Sin,</HI> that is, <HI>Ten thousand Years,</HI> which hath descended to all the Emperors to this Day.</P>
<P>To this great purpose he built a new Palace accordingly, all of Cedar, Cy|press, Camphire, and the like sweet smelling Woods; the scent of which, as they say, might be perceiv'd (<HI>a</HI>) twenty one <HI>Chinese</HI> Furlongs from thence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">About five <HI>English</HI> Mile.</NOTE></P>
<P>Amidst this wonderful Structure, he rais'd a Tower all of Copper, of twen|ty Rods high, (a marvellous piece of Work) with a winding Pair of Stairs in the middle, from the bottom to the top: There was also a Copper Bason, Cast in the form of a Hand, which every Morning was fill'd with early De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">v, wherein the Emperor steep'd the Oriental Pearls to soften them, being part of the Preparations of the Medicines of <HI>Immortality:</HI> But at last they wrought up|on his Belief so far, that the <HI>Elexar</HI> was ready, which Drinking, would so per|petuate
<PB N="592" REF="256">
Youth, that he should live according to his Title, <HI>Ten thousand Years,</HI> that is, <HI>He should be Immortal.</HI></P>
<P>The Longevity-Potion being brought, was set on the Table, which should begin the Work of <HI>Youths Renovation;</HI> when one of his Councellors, a Minister of State, first disswading him from the taking of it, suddenly threw the Liquor down upon the Floor; at which, the Emperor much incens'd that he should lose his expectation of <HI>Immortality,</HI> which had cost so much time and treasure in Preparing, consulted with what Death he should punish so bold an Offen|der; when he that stood thus liable to his fury, spake thus mildly and undis|compos'd to him.</P>
<P><HI>Sir, You cannot put me to Death, for I have drunk the same Medicine of</HI> Immortali|ty <HI>already, and am</HI> Immortal; <HI>so if I die I am guiltless, because the Medicine wants the promised Efficacy, and therefore use your pleasure; yet I suspect, that if your Indignation fall upon me, what I have drunk will be of no Defence, and I feel I shall certainly suffer Death, being conscious of the Deceit of these that are Trapanners for Bread.</HI> Which mol|lifying Speech so pacify'd the Emperor, that he gave him his Life; yet how|soever, the Emperor prosecuted the same business, to make himself <HI>Rich, Hapyy,</HI> and <HI>Immortal.</HI></P>
<P>There are also a third kind of Philosophers, by <HI>Semedo</HI> call'd <HI>Taokiao,</HI> and by <HI>Trigaut,</HI> from the first Promoter, <HI>Lonzu;</HI> as likewise by <HI>Semedo, Tunsi</HI> or <HI>Tusi,</HI> being the first broacher of this Doctrine, which agrees with the <HI>Epicureans,</HI> who affirm, <NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Post mort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> nulla <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> That there is no pleasure after death, and therefore they indulge what e're in their life seems to be easie and happy, so to prolong their lives, to continue their present welfare they use all means possible, and not onely study Longevity, but also how to be Immortal by ingenious discoveries for self-preservation.</P>
<P>But though <HI>Laotan</HI> accounts the <HI>Summum Bonum</HI> to consist in Pleasures, yet <HI>Martinius</HI> finds him to be no way Atheistical, but declares it every where pro|bable, that <HI>Laotan</HI> hath acknowledg'd one Supream Deity, saying, <HI>Tao, or Great Understanding hath no Name; he hath Created Heaven and Earth, he is without shape; moves the Stars, though he himself is immoveable; and because I know not his Name, I will call him</HI> Tao, <HI>or Supream Understanding, without form.</HI></P>
<P>The same Philosopher makes mention in another place, of <HI>The Creation of the Heavens.</HI></P>
<P>It is not to be credited, what the Fathers report out of their Stories con|cerning this Philosopher <HI>Laotan,</HI> that he lay conceal'd, being lock'd up in his Mothers Womb eighty one, or according to <HI>Trigaut</HI> eighty years; and after|wards forc'd his passage into the World through her right side; wherefore ac|cording to <HI>Trigaut</HI> he is call'd <HI>Lauzu,</HI> and by <HI>Martinius, Laosu;</HI> and and last of all, <HI>Laotan,</HI> that is, <HI>Old Philosopher:</HI> The time of his Maturation, or rather Im|prisonment in the Womb, was (as they say) nine times nine Years, which the <HI>Chineses</HI> account the fulness of Perfection, and all things that are perfect: And because <HI>Laotan</HI> was one of their greatest and most learned Stages, they invented the foremention'd number, as if Nature had spent so many Years in perfecting of him.</P>
<P>This <HI>Laotan</HI> was born in the Kingdom of <HI>Zu,</HI> (for <HI>China</HI> contain'd anciently many and several Kingdoms) at this day the County <HI>Fungyangfu,</HI> of the Pro|vince of <HI>Nanking,</HI> in the City <HI>Mao, Anno</HI> 603&punc; about twenty four Years before <HI>Confut,</HI> the Prime Philosopher amongst the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="593" REF="256">The third Sect (saith <HI>Martinius</HI>) is also like the <HI>Epicurean,</HI> they place Happi|ness<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">.

Amongst this are many Sorcerers, and such as use Magick, and is indeed the vilest of all Sects; the followers thereof nevertheless praise the Morality of our <HI>European</HI> Doctrine.</P>
<P>According to <HI>Trigaut, Laotan</HI> left not one Book of his Doctrine, nor as it ap|pears, would teach no new Opinion; but some of his followers call'd <HI>Tansu,</HI> after his death, nam'd him, <HI>The Head of Learning,</HI> and Collected several Books in a handsome Stile, from divers other Opinions and Writings. These also live unmarry'd in Cloysters, in which they make their Pupils, and are as leud and wicked, as the followers of the foremention'd. They never cut the Hair of their Heads, but are distinguish'd from others, by wearing a Hat or Bonnet of Wood upon the knot which ties the Hair on the Crown of their Heads.</P>
<P>Other of this Sect that are Marry'd, with great Zeal observe the Tenets of their Fraternity at home in their own Houses: They Honor, as they say, amongst many other Images, <HI>The Lord, or King of the Heavens,</HI> but one that is Bodily, and as they say in their Books, hath had many troubles: They also affirm, That <HI>the King of the Heavens,</HI> which Reigns at this day, is call'd <HI>Ciam;</HI> but he who Govern'd them formerly, was nam'd <HI>Leu.</HI> This <HI>Leu,</HI> say they, on a certain time sitting on a white Dragon, descended to the Earth, and invited <HI>Ciam</HI> (who they affirm was a Magician) to a Dinner: But whilst <HI>Leu,</HI> making himself merry at the Table, <HI>Ciam</HI> getting upon the White Dragon, ascended up to Heaven, and took possession of the Celestial Realm.</P>
<P><HI>Leu</HI> thus prevented from returning by <HI>Ciam,</HI> yet obtain'd a Grant from <HI>The new King of Heaven,</HI> for the Dominion over certain Mountains in this Countrey, where they suppose he still lives, bereav'd of his old Dignity.</P>
<P>They Worship therefore according to their own confession, a foraign Rob|ber and Tyrant for their God.</P>
<P>Besides this their Supream Power, they Worship another, which is a triple Deity, one of which is <HI>Lauzu,</HI> the chief of their Sect.</P>
<P>These also hold forth Rewards after Death; and many of those which are most Holy, and observe their Rules, enter Soul and Body into Paradice, being capable of all Heavenly Joy; which to affirm, they shew many Images of the Departed, which were translated thither in the Flesh.</P>
<P>The peculiar Office of the Priests of this Sect is to clear Houses, which they believe are haunted with Evil Spirits, which they do by setting up Papers Painted with horrid Resemblances, and making a hideous cry and noise through all the Rooms, as if they were Possest themselves.</P>
<P>These Priests have their Residences in the Emperor's Temples, Consecrated to Heaven and Earth, and in Person attend the Emperor's Sacrifices, either when he Offers himself, or his foremention'd Magistrates, by which means they are in great esteem and request.</P>
<P>The Musick which fills up the Ceremony, the Priests perform themselves, Playing on several Instruments which may be pleasing to them, but seems very harsh to us of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>They are also sent for to Funerals of the Grandees, before which they walk in costly Habits, Playing on Horns, Sagbuts, and other Instruments: They also spend their time in warming new Houses, and conduct new Marry'd People alongst the Streets in State, which at certain times is done at the charge and appointment of the Magistrates.</P>

<HEAD>The manner of the Building of the Cities in China.</HEAD>
<P>MOst of the Cities in all <HI>China</HI> are of one Model and Fashion, and ex|ceed each other only in Bigness and Commerce; for most of them are square, with broad and high Walls of Brick or Free-stone, Fortifi'd round about at an exact distance, with high Watch-Towers, not unlike those of the ancient <HI>Romans;</HI> surrounded with broad Moats; and within, with <HI>Pal|lasadoes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="594" REF="259">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>The Entrances into the City have always double Gates, one before ano|ther, with <HI>Portcullases,</HI> between those two Gates is a large Court, wherein the Soldiers are Exercis'd that belong to the Guard: These Gates are not oppo|site but oblique, so that they cannot see through them both at once: The first hangs on a double Wall, which appears like our Bulwarks. Above the Gates, on the Arch are high Towers, which the <HI>Chineses</HI> call <HI>Muen Leu,</HI> in which the Soldiers keep Guard, and are Magazines where their Arms are kept.</P>

<P><PB N="599" REF="259">The same Person which Watches the Hours, hath an Eye also (because he looks over the whole City) if any Fire should accidentally happen in one House or other, and by beating on his Drum, raises all the Citizens to the quench|ing of it: He whose House is set a Fire through his own carelesness, suffers Death without mercy, because of the danger which threatens the neighboring Houses, all built of Wood.</P>
<P>On these Time-telling Towers, the Governors often meet to keep their Festivals.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Pagodes or Temples.</HEAD>
<P>NOt far from these Turrets stands generally a <HI>Pagan</HI> Chappel, besides a Temple Consecrated to the Spirit or good <HI>Genious</HI> of the City.</P>
<P>In these, all the Governors or Magistrates, on the entring into their Offices, take their Oaths of Allegiance, and the like, as if before the God or Protector of their City.</P>
<P>In former Ages, the <HI>Chineses</HI> in these Temples honor'd only the fore-menti|on'd Spirits; but at this day Worship other Idols.</P>
<P>Great numbers of these <HI>Pagodes</HI> are through all <HI>China,</HI> and are likewise built in solitary places, on the tops and declinings of Mountains.</P>
<P>Most of these <HI>Pagodes</HI> are inhabited by Priests, who live there upon the an|cient Revenues granted them of the place: The <HI>Pagodes</HI> also afford good Lodg|ings and Entertainment for Travellers, who there find plenty of all things.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pagodes</HI> or Temples are within furnish'd with Images, to the number in some of above a thousand, and hung round about with black Lamps, which burn Night and Day, in Commemoration of those, as they conceive, which liv'd Piously, and dy'd Happily.</P>
<P>Some Images sit on Tables, as if they liv'd and were consulting together.</P>
<P>At the entrance, or behind the other Images stand horrible shapes, Horn'd Fiends, with open Mouths, and Hands with grievous Claws.</P>
<P>In the middle commonly appears an Altar, whereon sits an Image of some times thirty, forty, fifty, nay a hundred Foot high, to which the Temple is Consecrated, besides several lesser Idols on each side thereof; before the Image stands generally a thick, but hollow Cane, full of little Reeds or Pens, in|scrib'd with <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters, which they believe foretel future events: On each side are Perfuming-Pots, which are continually supply'd, and in the mid|dle stands a Woodden Charger, in which the Priest puts his Offerings, when he Invokes the God on some exigent, to grant him a favorable sign of good suc|cess: The Altar is Colour'd Red, with which no common Houses may be Painted.</P>
<P>A <HI>Pagode</HI> or Temple, which was formerly the Hall of a Palace, belonging to a grand Eunuch, near the City of <HI>Peking,</HI> and afterwards on the Emperor's Command given to the <HI>Iesuits</HI> for a Chappel, <HI>Trigaut</HI> says, was before set forth after this manner:</P>
<P>In the chief Isle stood a great Altar of Bak'd and Hewn Stone, curiously Wrought, and Painted Red, after the manner of their Temples: Upon the middle of the Altar sat a great and horrible Monster, Bak'd of Clay, Gilt from top to bottom.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd this Image <HI>Tuan,</HI> and suppose it Commands over the Earth and Riches thereof; wherefore we with the ancient Poets should call
<PB N="600" REF="260">
it <HI>Pluto:</HI> It had a Scepter in one Hand, and a Crown on its Head, both not un|like the Marks of our Kings. On each side of the Isle stood two great Tables, every one Guarded by five Infernal Judges, which were also Painted on the Walls, sitting on Seats of Justice, and Condemn'd (as they said) the Sinners to Everlasting Torments, every one according to his Condition: Before them stood many Furies, far more terrible (with tormenting Scourges) than those which we represent; and in such manner those Devils seem'd to punish the Criminals, that they struck a Terror to the Living; for some lay broyl'd on Gridirons, others boyl'd in Oil, others again rent to Pieces, some cut through in the middle, torn to Pieces by Dogs, bruis'd in Mortars, and other such like cruel Punishments.</P>
<P>The first of the fore-mention'd Infernal Judges seem'd to examine the Ma|lefactors, which as the <HI>Chineses</HI> suppose, he re-views in a Looking-Glass; this done, he sends them to the other Judges, according to the several Punish|ments which they are to suffer: Amongst them was one, whose Office was to Punish by Transmigration, sending the Souls of the Malefactor into worse Bodies than formerly they possess'd; transforming Tyrants to Tygers, de|bauch'd Persons into Swine, others into such Beasts as best suit with their In|clination: But for Petty Crimes, the Rich, they only became poor and despi|cable People.</P>
<P>There were also a great Pair of Scales, in one of which stood a Sinner, and in the other a Prayer Book of the Doctrine of the Idols, which weigh'd down the Sinner, and releas'd him from Punishments.</P>
<P>In the middle, before the resemblance of Hell, flow'd a River of a strange Colour, into which many were dragg'd; cross the River lay two Bridges, one of Gold, and the other of Silver, over which pass'd those that had been true <HI>Pagan-Worshippers,</HI> and wore several Badges of their Offices and Service shewn to the Idols; and had for their Guides the Servants of the Idols, under whose Defence they past through the midst of all the Torments of Hell, and came at last to pleasant Fields, Groves, and Vallies.</P>
<P>In another corner were drawn the Jaws of Hell, belching out Flames, Ser|pents and Furies, towards the Gates of Hell, which were made of Copper; many other more of that kind were also seen: In several places of the Temple was written on Scrols, <HI>That whosoe're calls a thousand times on this Image by Name, shall be freed from all these Tortures.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Triumphal Arches.</HEAD>
<P>IN several Cities, to their no small Ornament, are divers Triumphal Ar|ches, most of them of hewn Marble, with great Art and curious Imagery, richly wrought, after the manner of the <HI>Goths;</HI> they are, as anciently amongst the <HI>Romans,</HI> built in Commemoration of those which have done some great Service to that City or Countrey; sometimes also for the Citizens, that have attain'd to the heighth of their Learning.</P>
<P>They are chiefly built in the Eminentest Streets and most Populous places, and consist in three Portals, the biggest in the middle, and the two lesser on each side, through which they pass.</P>
<P>On both sides stand Marble Lions, and other fine Imagery; on the Ceilings are Celestial Signs, Birds, Flowers, Snakes, Serpents, and the like, done very Artificially.</P>
<P>Those places that are void of Statues are curiously Carv'd or adorn'd with other Imagery, and are so Cut, that they seem Pendant in the Air. It deserves no small admiration, how such vast Stones could be Wrought and Cut through, that they seem rather like loose Chains of divers Links, than singly Wrought.
<PB N="603" REF="263">
The whole Arch rests on high Pillars, and both before and behind of one fa|shion; The upper part of the Roof generally consists in three Stories or Par|titions, every one divided, with some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">hings resembling our Architecture; Upon the Summit of the Arch lies a blue Stone, cover'd with a small Gilded Arch, on which the Emperor's Name in whose Reign the Arch was built is Engraven; Beneath in the Front appears another broad Stone, whereon is an Inscription, with the Name of the Person in honor of whom, and for what good Service it was erected.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Buildings.</HEAD>
<P>THe Artificers and Tradesmens Houses in the Cities are not built with any great art, because the <HI>Chineses</HI> regard more their Ease and Con|venience than Ornaments; yet though they are not ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> stately, they are convenient and sufficiently comely: But the Houses of the Grandees are very magnificent and large.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses,</HI> as <HI>Adam Schall</HI> witnesseth, use no Stone for their high Build|ings, but onely Timber joyn'd and fastned to one another with Iron Rings, after the same manner as our Masts in great Ships are; which thus conjoyn'd is colour'd over with <HI>Chinese</HI> Varnish, or Wax call'd <HI>Cie,</HI> and sometimes Gilded, to the no small lustre thereof.</P>
<P>They take no delight in many Stories, never raising them higher than two,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">l. p. 6.</NOTE> though generally but one, they counting it a hard labor to go up Stairs or Ladders.</P>
<P>The lower part of their House is onely inhabited, it being divided into handsom Chambers and Halls: As to the out-part of the House, it is but mean (except the great Gate and other lesser Wickets, which are stately built before Noble-mens Houses) but the inner part is pleasant, and very curiously wrought, all shining with the Varnish <HI>Cie.</HI> They are generally built of Wood, yea, the Emperor's Palace it self, though the Walls which separate the Halls and Anti-Chambers are commonly of Brick, but the Roof rests on wooden Pillars, and not on Walls, as ours do, and not cover'd with Tyles of Clay. They look not forwards through Windows, Persons of Quality accounting it ill Breed|ing to open a Casement into the Street. Every House hath several Yards or Halls one behind another; the privatest or last of which is in habited by the Women, who are kept so close, as if in Prison.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses,</HI> according to <HI>Trigaut,</HI> when they begin to Build, erect first the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 5. p. 6.</NOTE> Pillars of their Houses, which are all of Wood, for Stone is of no esteem amongst them; nay, the Pillars in the Emperors Courts and Governors Hou|ses are also of Wood: On the rais'd Columns they lay great pieces of Timber, and on them the Roof: The Walls are made last of all of Clay or Mortar, which if they should chance to fall, yet the Timber-work would stand, and the Roof-remains firm and whole. The order in which the Pillars stand, is the same with all other open places; for every Court of the Governors is divi|ded into several base Courts or Quadrangles pav'd with Free-Stone; the Floors of them being somewhat lower than those of the Chambers, they ascend a few Steps up to them and the Galleries.</P>
<P>And again in another place the same <HI>Trigaut</HI> saith, That the <HI>Chineses</HI> are not<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lib. 1. cap. 4.</NOTE> to be compar'd to us in Architecture, neither for beauty nor durance; for they build according to Mans life, and (as they say) onely for themselves and not for others; whereas we on the contrary build for future Ages.</P>
<P><PB N="604" REF="264">The <HI>Chineses</HI> dig no Foundations, but lay on the Ground which they design to build on, very great Stones; or if they chance to dig Foundations, they are never above two or three Yards deep, though for exceeding high Towers, so that they seldom last one Age. Nor in like manner their Clay Walls, which give them the trouble of a constant and daily repairing; from whence it happens also, that their Houses are for the most part of Wood, or rest on wooden Posts; in which there is no small convenience, because the Walls may be repair'd without medling with the other parts of the Houses, for the Roofs rest not on the Walls, but on Columns. Thus far <HI>Trigaut.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Palaces, or Governors Courts.</HEAD>
<P>THe Palaces are all built at the Emperor's Charge for Residences for the Governors, as well Civil as Martialist: And the Emperor doth not onely provide Courts and Ships for his Governors, but also all man|ner of necessary Furniture, Provisions and Servants; nay, when a Governor (which is most remarkable) either goes to another Province, or serv'd out the time of his Office (which sometimes happens to be in half a year) he may take all the Furniture with him, and then again new is provided for his Successor.</P>
<P>The Houses of the Magistrates exceed all other in beauty, bigness, and Or|namentals, and may justly be call'd <HI>Courts</HI> or <HI>Palaces.</HI></P>
<P>In every Metropolis are fifteen, twenty, or more such publick Edifices, in the chief Cities; at least eight, and four in the lesse, all after one Model, except that the one is bigger than the other, according to the Quality of the Go|vernors.</P>
<P>The great Palaces have four or five Halls, with as many Porches that stand before them.</P>
<P>At the Front of every Palace three Gates, the biggest in the middle, every one adorn'd on each side with great Lyons of Marble. Before the greatest Gate is a large Court Rail'd in, which glitters exceedingly with the <HI>Chinese</HI> Varnish. In the middle of this Court stand two Towers, or Musick-Rooms, ready pro|vided with Drums, and all sorts of Instruments to play on whene're the Go|vernor goes in or out to sit on the Bench of Justice. Beyond this Gate is a spacious Hall, wherein those that Plead, or have any Business with the Go|vernor, wait; on each side thereof are small Apartments for the Judges of the lower Bench; beyond are two Rooms, wherein Persons of Quality, that come to visit the Governors, are received; in them are Stools and Benches, and all things necessary for Entertainment. In these also the right-Hand is given to the Civilists, or Citizens, and the left to the Martialist. Passing through these Chambers you come to another Gate, which is seldom open'd but when the Governor keeps a Court-Day. The middlemost is of an extraordinary bigness, and none but Lords and Noble-men are suffer'd to go through it, all other Persons walking through the side-Gates. Beyond this Gate is another large Court, at the end whereof stands a great Apartment rest|ing on Columns, and is call'd <HI>Tang.</HI> In this Chamber or Hall the Governor sits on the Bench; on each side thereof Servants, Messengers, and other Offi|cers, have little Houses for their Residences.</P>
<P>These Officers never remove with the Governor, but live there during their life-time, being maintain'd at the Emperors Charge, and serve one Lord after another, without changing their Habitations.</P>
<P><PB N="605" REF="264">
<FIGURE>

<P>Behind this Apartment is another inward Chamber, much statelier than the first, which is call'd <HI>Sutang,</HI> that is, <HI>The Privy-Chamber;</HI> in which onely the greatest Friends to the Governor give their Visits, and pay Respects; about it on the out-side the Governors Houshold have their Dwellings; behind it opens the greatest Gate, where also are the Governors own Lodgings, and a little apart his Wives and Concubines, being all neatly built, and conveniently contriv'd. There are also Warrens, Gardens, and all things fit for Countrey Recreation.</P>
<P>A Palace belonging to an Eunuch, not far from the City <HI>Peking,</HI> is by <HI>Trigaut,</HI> with the following Platform, thus described:</P>
<P>On each side before the Gates stand two Marble Stones, in a manner like Steps to get on Horseback from; before the Entrance of the Palace runs a Wall about six Foot high; behind which opens a small Entry or Alley, in the middle whereof stands the prime <HI>Portico,</HI> or chief Stone Gate, to which they go mounted on Steps, with two Chambers on the right, and three on the left-hand, which have their Entrances into the little Alley; beyond this Gate opens a great Court, where on the right-Hand stand three, and on the left-Hand four Chambers; At the end of this first Court is another Gate, which they first ascend on Steps, and having pass'd through it, descend again on the other side into a second Court; in the middle whereof on each side, a Gate or Door with Steps leads to the Halls that are on both sides of this Court; behind which is also a great Hall, and beyond that a third Court of the same form as the second; and at last appears a stately Garden, surrounded with a Wall of twenty Hand high, and cut through in the middle with a pav'd Way.</P>

<P>In like manner, they can go from the Province of <HI>Chikiang</HI> in their Barges along the Rivers through that of <HI>Suchuen;</HI> nay, there is scarce any City, either little or great in all <HI>China,</HI> to which they cannot come by Water, because the whole Countrey is not onely naturally full of Rivers, but are also divided and sub|divided by industry into several Channels and Rivulets: But their Ships that lie in several Bays and Harbors resemble Woods.</P>
<P>Such an innumerable and vast number of Shipping are in the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> that the Inhabitants thereof proffer'd the Emperor of <HI>China,</HI> when on a time he resolv'd to War against the <HI>Iapanners,</HI> to make him a Bridge or Cawsey of Ships, that should reach from their Coast to <HI>Iapan,</HI> and well it might have been done, if they could have endur'd the turbulency of the Sea.</P>
<P>Amongst all other, the Imperial Ships belonging to the Governors are the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ships of the Governors.</NOTE> best and stoutest, and indeed in curious Work and Ornamentals, exceed ours in <HI>Europe:</HI> they shew in the Water like Towers or Castles, and are on both sides divided into several Apartments; in the middle is a stately Room provided with all manner of Necessaries, and Hung with Tapestry, and furnish'd in State, with whatever belongs to a Princes Palace; in stead of Glass Win|dows they have Silk varnish'd and painted with Flowers, Birds, Trees, and the like, which is so close that no Wind penetrates. Round about the Ship on the Deck are Galleries and Rails, between which the Sea-men or Mariners can do their Business without any trouble or disturbance. The whole Ship is varnish'd with the Wax by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Cie,</HI> which gives a great lustre, being also mix'd with divers Colours; the in-side is painted with Birds, Beasts, Cities, and the like, in Golden Colours (the proper Livery of the Emperor,) which are worthy of observation, and very delightful to the Eye. They use no Nails in all their Ships, because the Timber and Planks are pegg'd together with wooden Pins.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chinese</HI> Vessels are in length equal with our <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Galleys, but are not so high and broad; on a Ladder of Leather with twelve Steps they get into them. The Prow, where the Drummers beat and Trumpeters sound their Levets, is made like a Castle. Upon the sound of the Drums and Trumpets all the other Vessels give them the way, unless it be a <HI>Mandarin</HI> of greater Quality,
<PB N="609" REF="266">
then the inferior gives way to the superior, without any the least disturbance or dispute, all which Cases being order'd by the Law, according to which every one must govern himself; wherefore on the Head of every Ship stands written in great Golden Letters of a Foot and a half long, the Quality of every Governor; from both the sides flie divers colour'd Silk Flags and Penons.</P>
<P>In calm Weather there are People, which in stead of Horses, Tow the Ves|sels by a Line, or Row them: They also use their Oars just as the Fishes their Fins or Tails, with very great dexterity and swiftness, to the no little manife|station of their Ingenuity. They also Steer a Ship with a single Oar after the same manner as we our Boats.</P>
<P>Exceeding stately are those Ships which every three Moneths to the num|ber of five, come with Silk-Stuffs and Garments from the Metropolis of <HI>Nan|king</HI> to the Court of <HI>Peking,</HI> and are by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Lungchychuen,</HI> as if they would say <HI>Ships of Dragons Clothes,</HI> because they are sent to the Emperor, whose Arms and Marks are Dragons; they are Gilt all over, and colour'd Red. To these all the Governors Vessels are inferior, and must give them the Way where|soe're they meet them.</P>
<P>Swift Streams, which between the Hills and Valleys have great Falls, are Row'd up by the <HI>Chineses</HI> with a sort of little Boats with two Oars or Steerers, one before at the Head, and the other at the Stern; by means of which they guide their Boats between the Rocks with great dexterity and ease, as if they had a Horse by the Reins, though sometimes the Channel is so narrow, that the Vessels can scarce pass through the same, but are forc'd to go round about the Stones, which lie scatter'd and cumber the Channel every where.</P>
<P>This troublesom Rowing, though an ingenious Invention of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> hath rais'd this Proverb amongst them, <HI>That their Boats are Paper, and their Wa|termen Iron,</HI> because they are made of very thin Boards, like our slit Deal, which are not nail'd, but fastned together with Withs, in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Rotang;</HI> by which means the Boats, though often beaten by the strong Current against the Rocks, split not, but bend and give way.</P>
<P>In the third County <HI>Sucheufu,</HI> of the Province of <HI>Nanking,</HI> the Inhabitants keep many Pleasure-Boats onely for their Recreation, all of them being richly gilded and painted with several colours to the Life, so that we may rather call them stately Houses than Ships. Many oftentimes spend their whole Estates in these Vessels, being too indulgent to Wine and Women.</P>
<P>In a delightful Lake call'd <HI>Si,</HI> near the chief City <HI>Hangcheu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> are also very gallant Vessels, which Row up and down in the same in fair Weather for their pleasure. All things about these Vessels are either gilded or painted with various colours, where they always highly Treat, and are presented with Stage-Plays, and other such like Divertisements. The Ships in the interim furnish'd with all manner of Necessaries, Sail without fear of Shipwrack cross the Lake, notwithstanding many by sudden Storms or Tem|pests are in the middle of their Mirth cast away.</P>
<P>They have also a kind of <HI>Gundelo's,</HI> in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Lungschen,</HI> that is, <HI>Serpent-Boats,</HI> from their resembling of Water-Snakes, and their be|ing Painted and Carv'd all over with various Serpents; some over-grown with Hair, and hoop'd in with broad Iron Rings, are also joyn'd together with Ribbons of divers colours, very neatly, and with great art interwoven toge|ther. The Masts, which are generally three, and hung with Silk Penons and Flags, have an Idol upon the top of them, as also one on the Prow of the
<PB N="610" REF="267">
Ship; on the Stern are many Ensigns, hung full of Tufts of Hair, Silk Flags, and long Feathers; the whole Vessel is hung round about with Gold and Silk Fringe; under the Deck sit the Rowers, generally to the number of ten or twelve, richly Cloth'd in Silk, and Gilded Crowns on their Heads; at the sound of a Drum they strike their Oars (which are made like a Spoon) into the Wa|ter, and make such quick way, that they seem to go as swift as Lightning; in a Gap in the Stern oftentimes hangs a Boy, a Jugler, who leaping into the Water, makes pleasant sport for the Passengers.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Yellow River</HI> are a kind of Carriages, or rather floating Villages, con|sisting in great thick Reeds, by the <HI>Indians</HI> call'd <HI>Bambu,</HI> or <HI>Bambo's,</HI> which are so closely ty'd together with Withs, by them nam'd <HI>Rotang,</HI> that the least drop of Water cannot get through them. On these Floats are Huts and little Houses of Boards and other sleight Materials, cover'd with Roofs made of Mats, in which the <HI>Chineses</HI> dwell with their Wives and Children (in someto the num|ber of two hundred) as on the Main Land, and never inhabit on the Shore: They drive along with the Stream down the Rivers, or else are Tow'd against the Current with a Line, for Sails they use none.</P>
<P>Those that reside in these floating Villages drive a Trade with all sorts of Merchandise, and carry them from one place to another on the River: at the Towns before which they stop, they run Stakes into the Ground, to which they make fast their floating Isle.</P>
<P>There are also some in <HI>China,</HI> which with their whole Families reside in or|dinary Vessels, and Sail in Fleets of four or five hundred together, Trading through the whole Empire; so that from whence these Fleets remove, it seems as if a Forrest moved. They keep likewise all manner of tame Cattel in those Vessels, especially Swine; and wheresoever they arrive, they generally stay several Moneths.</P>
<P>Father <HI>Martin</HI> doubts not, but that the <HI>Chinese</HI> Merchants have anciently, as at this day, furrow'd the Seas as far as the <HI>Red Lake:</HI> for in these modern Times they build great Ships call'd <HI>Pancum da China,</HI> which in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue signifies <HI>A Wooden Palace;</HI> neither have we small testimonies of it through all <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That the</HI> Chineses (saith he) <HI>have antiently frequented the Seas, and Sail'd with their Ships to remote Countreys, doth not darkly appear by the Voyage of one</HI> Luseng, <HI>sent out by the Emperor</HI> Ching <HI>or</HI> Xi, Anno 214. <HI>before the Nativity of</HI> Christ, <HI>to discover the Northern Countreys; for he, amongst others, proffer'd the Emperor some Geographical Descriptions of several Countreys in the World, and especially of</HI> China, <HI>and the Islands lying in the</HI> East Sea, <HI>otherwise call'd</HI> Mare Eoum; <HI>from whence some will conclude, that the Name</HI> Cingala (<HI>which signifies</HI> Sand-plats of the <HI>Chineses, on which a Fleet of Ships suffer'd Shipwrack</HI>) <HI>hath its original: From hence is also deriv'd</HI> Ceilon, <HI>or</HI> Sin|lan, <HI>that is,</HI> Inhabitants of China, <HI>or</HI> Chineses: <HI>Moreover, that the</HI> Chineses <HI>of the Island</HI> St. Laurence <HI>or</HI> Madagaskar, <HI>is affirmed by the</HI> Chineses <HI>that reside on this Island, especially at the Bay of</HI> St. Clare, <HI>where Men of white Complexions speak the</HI> Chinese <HI>Language.</HI></P>
<P>This Negotiation of the <HI>Chineses</HI> extended it self to all the Islands in the <HI>Oriental Sea,</HI> and <HI>to India</HI> it self, till the time of the <HI>Portuguese</HI> first coming thi|ther; but afterwards it was neglected, partly for the remoteness of the Places, and partly out of fear of the <HI>Portuguese:</HI> But <HI>Iapan,</HI> the <HI>Philippine Isles, Macassar, Iava, Camboya, Sion,</HI> and <HI>Cochinchina,</HI> the <HI>Chineses</HI> frequent with their Ships laden with Merchandise to this very day, especially those of the Province of <HI>Fokien;</HI>
<PB N="611" REF="267">
for scarce any other <HI>Chineses</HI> frequent the Sea, or go to foreign Countreys against the Laws of the Empire.</P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>Hiaou,</HI> who <HI>Anno</HI> 140. before the <HI>Incarnation</HI> began his Reign, after having by means of the General <HI>Chankieng</HI> subdu'd the Kingdoms of <HI>Ynpei,</HI> (at this day <HI>Tungking</HI> and <HI>Laos</HI>) <HI>Tavon</HI> and <HI>Takia,</HI> lying near the West, sent a Fleet of Ships to the East through the <HI>Chinese</HI> Sea, or Bay call'd <HI>Sang.</HI> But those Places to which the fore-mention'd Fleet Sail'd, were not describ'd by the <HI>Chi|nese</HI> Geographers, which is no wonder; for as these People have a great and high opinion of themselves, and account foreign things not worth their know|ledge or description; therefore we cannot say whether this Fleet went to <HI>Iapan,</HI> or to the Isles <HI>Linson, Ceilon, Iava, Camboya,</HI> and the like Places.</P>
<P>The timely finding of the <HI>Magnet</HI> or <HI>Load-stone,</HI> and <HI>Compass,</HI> by the <HI>Chineses,</HI> give also no small testimonies of their Navigation.</P>
<P>As <HI>Martinius</HI> saith, the Properties of the <HI>Magnet,</HI> and its respecting the North and South, or the <HI>Compass,</HI> was known to the <HI>Chineses</HI> many Ages before the <HI>Incarnation,</HI> and before the People of <HI>Europe;</HI> for when in the Reign of <HI>Zing, Anno</HI> 1115. before the Birth of <HI>Christ,</HI> the <HI>Cochinchineses,</HI> by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Kiaochi,</HI> had the first time sent an Agent to the Emperor, with a white Hen or Pheasant for a Present, the Agent was by the Emperor's Tutor call'd <HI>Cheu|cung,</HI> a great Astronomer, presented with a piece of Workmanship artificially wrought, which of it self without ceasing pointed directly towards the South, not onely when it was carry'd by Land, but by Water also.</P>
<P>This Piece was with two Syllables call'd <HI>Zinan,</HI> which is like that where|with the <HI>Chineses</HI> at this day call the <HI>Load-stone;</HI> which serves for an infallible testimony (as <HI>Martinius</HI> saith) that the use thereof was found out onely by the <HI>Chineses</HI> at that time. It is not like our <HI>Compass</HI> divided into thirty two Points, but onely into four, which respect the four chief Winds, as East, West, South, and North.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> are little experienc'd in the Mystery of Navigation, not being able to take an Observation of what Latitude they are in with a <HI>Quadrant,</HI> but govern themselves onely by their <HI>Compass</HI> and <HI>Evening-Star:</HI> At the rising of a Storm or Tempest they chuse not Sea-room as our Mariners, but running with their Ships ashore, leap over-board, and cry <HI>Sequa, Sequa.</HI></P>
<P>I will here annex what I have receiv'd concerning the <HI>Chinese</HI> Ships, from the Writings of <HI>David Wright,</HI> who resided a considerable time in the Island of <HI>Formosa</HI> and <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> (saith he) call their great Ships <HI>Zoen,</HI> and not Jonks, or <HI>Ioven|cheu,</HI> as most have written, but by that Name understand our <HI>Christian</HI> Vessels; some of them carry a thousand one hundred Last, or twenty two hundred Tun, some a thousand, others six hundred, others two, and many less.</P>
<P>Their Men of War have a Fore-Castle, and another along the Quarter-Deck, which are higher than the sides of the Ship; in which the Soldiers keep in the time of a close Fight, and serve also for Gun-Rooms, wherein they keep their Arms and Ammunition.</P>
<P>Their greatest Ships of War carry not above forty Guns, some thirty, and others twenty, and ten; all the Guns which they carry in their Vessels being smaller than ours, some carrying not above eight pound Ball, others scarce four, three, two, or one; some are Cast of Copper, others of Brass.</P>
<P>Men of War with forty Guns carry eight hundred Men; those with ten, two hundred, and generally more Soldiers than Sea-men.</P>
<P><PB N="612" REF="268">The Arms which they use are Musquets, Pikes, Darts, Bowes, Shields and Swords, with Fire-balls, and the like, besides many Fire-ships.</P>
<P>Their Men of War are made after another manner than ours, with broad Sterns; and also broad before, yet not above three Foot&punc; and from the mid|dle they run narrower towards the Head; they have no Keel, but are flat at the bottom; the biggest as well as the smallest carry two Masts, without Yards, Mizne, or Boltsprit. The Sails are made of Rushes and Cane Leaves in this manner:</P>
<P>First they make Net-work of split Reeds, as big as the Sail they intend to make, which spreading on the Ground, they lay five double Leaves of Canes all over it, and on these another Network made just like the undermost, all which is twin'd fast together round about and in the middle: which be|ing thus made, are fastned to the Yard with Ropes, like those of the <HI>Dutch Hoys;</HI> they loose and fasten the Strings one by one, and the Sail when taken from the Yard, is rowl'd up and laid along in the Ship; the Ropes wherewith they tie them are made of Hair, but their Cables of Canes or Reeds; the Sails have neither Braces nor Bowlings, but abundance of small Ropes, which are fastned from the top down to the bottom of the Sail, and all knotted together about a Fathom distance from it.</P>
<P>The Anchors are made of a sort of exceeding strong Wood, which sinks in the Water like Iron, and fastens in the Ground, with Flooks like ours; but they have no Anchor-stocks nor Rings, but through the end where our Anchor|stock is made fast, runs a Rope.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> carry no Flag-staffs, but in stead thereof a Mast, which stands in that part of the Ship where our Mizne-Mast stands: their Flags hang at the end of a long Stick on the top of the fore-mention'd Mast; which Stick is drawn up by a Rope that runs through the top, and is made fast about the middle thereof; on the other end is a Rope, with which they pull down the end of the Staff, and hoise up the other to which the Flag is fastned; they also carry Flags and Penons on their Fore and Main-Mast, according to the inser|ted Sculpture.</P>
<P>The Men of War generally bear a round Circle in their Flags, and not (as <HI>Linschot</HI> tells us) three Crescents with seven Stars, after the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> manner, one half Red, and the other yellow: and the whole Circle is surrounded with forty three Specks.</P>
<P>When any Ships come to an Anchor, then their Rudder, which is of another fashion than ours, they hoise Aboard, and put on again when they set Sail.</P>
<P>They have another sort of Vessels, by those of the Province of <HI>Fokien</HI> call'd <HI>Koeya,</HI> which are much lesser, the greatest carrying not above fifty, and the smallest twenty Tun, bearing onely one Mast.</P>
<P>A third sort call'd <HI>Sampan,</HI> or <HI>Champan,</HI> have also one Mast, but six Oars.</P>
<P>A fourth nam'd <HI>Lantya,</HI> have neither Sails nor Masts, but are like Barges, and carry'd with sixteen Oars, eight on each side, and to every one eight Men. These Vessels are not onely long, but bear a breadth, and serve against the Py|rats, which much molest the Rivers.</P>
<P>The Emperor keeps great numbers of these Vessels for the safeguard of Travellers and Merchants, and likewise keeps great Fleets of them upon the Sea-bordering Provinces, for defence of his Havens and Harbors.</P>
<P>All the Emperor's Ships and <HI>Lantayes</HI> carry in chief, the Imperial Arms in their Flags, being a Dragon with five Claws on each Foot.</P>
<P><PB N="613" REF="268">When any of their Ships coming from a foraign Countrey, stands in for the Shore, they can immediately know from whence it comes, and what her Loading, never asking from whence, or what their Freight, for they give no|tice thereof in this manner: The Pilot at the beating on Drums and Kettles, standing on the Stern, begins to make signs with the Staff in his Hands, and sometimes waves it over his Head, then behind his Back, then up in the Air, and annon down to his Feet; then laying the Staff down, he makes as many strange signs with his Hands and Arms, as he did before; which done, he takes the Staff up again, and begins a new, whilst the Pilots of those Ships that Ride at an Anchor in the Harbors, exactly observe his motions, and thereby know all what they desire concerning the Vessel; which strange kind of signs and tokens the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> believe are not to be done by Humane Reason, but by Necromancy and Arts of the Devil.</P>

<HEAD>Common Roads, or High-Ways.</HEAD>
<P>ALl strangers may justly wonder at the Roads and common High-ways that are so many, and withal, strangely and artificially contriv'd by Humane Industry, for the conveniency of the Traveller; especially in all the Southern Provinces, the Ways are first Levell'd and Pav'd with Stones, because they use not many Horses nor Wains: The highest Mountains are also turn'd into good Roads, by cutting and making Passages through the Cliffs on each side: Hills and tops of Mountains are Levell'd, and Vallies fill'd up therewith, to the great ease of Travellers.</P>
<P>There are also on certain places, as at every Stone, (lying ten <HI>Chinese</HI> Fur|longs from one another) Messengers or Posts, which speedily convey all Let|ters, the Emperor's and Governor's Edicts from one place to another, by which means, nothing that is strange or News happens, but in few days, it is spread through the whole Empire.</P>
<P>At every eighth Stone, being a Tract of a days Journey, are publick Houses or Inns, for Entertainment, call'd <HI>Cungyuon</HI> and <HI>Yhi,</HI> which entertain all Go|vernors, Magistrates, and other Imperial Officers, of what Degree soever, with their several Trains, at the Emperor's Charge; but they must by a Harbenger pre-acquaint the Hoast or Master of their coming, with the quality and number of their Attendance, so that when they come, they find all things in a readiness, not onely Provisions, but also Horses, Sedans, Porters, and Vessels, if there be occasion for them; for whatsoever he desires to have, he gives notice thereof to the Inn-keeper, by a Letter, in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Pai.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner, the Shores and Banks of Rivers are like the High-ways, handsomly made up, without any Trees or other hindrances, within eight Foot from the Water, that those which Tow the Vessels by Land, may have a clear Passage.</P>
<P>And also the Walls of several places are rais'd from the ground with great square Stones, and over-laid with Stone Bridges of divers Arches, where oc|casion requires it; so that the <HI>Chineses</HI> in this Point, not onely exceed the anci|ent <HI>Romans,</HI> but may also with all other People strive for the Palm, for though the <HI>Chineses</HI> are not comparable to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> in the Building of stately and strong Houses; yet in the erecting of Stone Bridges of exceeding bigness, and many Arches, they far exceed them, as may appear by the Description of se|veral before-mention'd.</P>

<HEAD>Rivers, Streams, and Channels.</HEAD>
<P>AMongst the Rivers which moisten the Countrey of <HI>China,</HI> the <HI>Kiang</HI> and <HI>Hoang,</HI> or <HI>Yellow River,</HI> deserve the first place, partly for their long course through almost the whole Empire, and partly for their greatness and abundance of Water.</P>
<P>The greatest Rivers are in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Kiang,</HI> but the less, <HI>Ho.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Yangzu-Kiang,</HI> or for its excellency, by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Kiang,</HI> as if they would say, <HI>The Son of the Sea,</HI> divides all <HI>China</HI> into a North and South part.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Kiang</HI> gliding from the West to the East, takes its Original out of the Mountain <HI>Min,</HI> which runs in a ledge of Hills, from the utmost Western Borders of the Province of <HI>Suchuen,</HI> into the Kingdom of <HI>Sifan,</HI> and extends Northward to the City <HI>Guei.</HI></P>
<P>It hath several Names from the several Countreys through and by which it passes; its first Name is <HI>Min,</HI> from the Mountain <HI>Min,</HI> its Spring and Ori|ginal, from whence it rushes with great force of Water, by the chief City <HI>Chingtu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Suchuen,</HI> and divides it self by the spreading into seve|ral Branches, and Incloses great part of the County <HI>Chintingfu,</HI> especially at and near the Metropolis <HI>Chingtu,</HI> in such a manner, with his Meandring Reaches and crooked Windings, that it lieth like an Island, and at the City <HI>Sincin,</HI> it changes its Name into that of <HI>Takiang,</HI> and passes from thence, inrich'd with the Wa|ters of other Rivulets; as the <HI>Lunghoa,</HI> from the East-side, and <HI>Chocang, Cin,</HI> and <HI>Tatu,</HI> from the West-side, by the City <HI>Sui,</HI> into the Stream of <HI>Mahu;</HI> from thence going on Eastward to the City <HI>Liucheu,</HI> where it is call'd <HI>Linkiang,</HI> and gliding to the City <HI>Chunking,</HI> receives the great River <HI>Pa</HI> with this Name; then passes North, through the County of <HI>Chunkingfu</HI> and <HI>Queicheufu,</HI> Southward of the City <HI>Queicheu</HI> or <HI>Patung,</HI> in one and thirty Degrees Northern Latitude, out of the Province of <HI>Suchuen,</HI> into that of <HI>Huquang,</HI> and then takes again the Name of <HI>Takiang,</HI> not far from the City of <HI>Queicheu.</HI></P>
<P>To this place it tumbles with many Gulfs, and great force of Water through crooked Vallies, amidst dangerous Rocks and amazing Precepices, which the <HI>Chineses</HI> in their Sailing, with great dexterity and nimbleness, know how to shun: But afterwards begins to glide more gentler, where on the North it falls in the Lake <HI>Tungting;</HI> and passing thence, this Lake and the chief City <HI>Vuchang</HI> enters the Province of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> and there receives out of the Lake <HI>Poy|ang,</HI> by which it passes on the North, great abundance of Water, and the name of <HI>Iang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">u Kiang.</HI></P>

<P>In the County <HI>Taipingfu,</HI> Southward from the City <HI>Nanking,</HI> the <HI>Kiang</HI> di|vides it self into two Arms, and makes the Island on which the little City <HI>Vu|hu</HI> stands situate, which afterwards against <HI>Nanking</HI> unite themselves again: On the South-West side of the City <HI>Taiping,</HI> the <HI>Kiang</HI> is press'd between two Hills belonging to the Mountain <HI>Tienmuen,</HI> through which it passes like a Gate; for which reason the Mountain is call'd <HI>Tienmuen,</HI> that is, <HI>Heaven Gate;</HI> then running by <HI>Chinkiang,</HI> at last disembogues it self through a great Bay into the Ocean; wherein lies in a small Isle the City <HI>Cinkiang,</HI> Garrison'd with Soldiers,
<PB N="615" REF="269">
and Fortifi'd with Ships; on both sides the Shores, are for the most part built with great and small Cities, Villages and Hamlets.</P>
<P>Before its fall from the City <HI>Kieukiam</HI> into the Sea, a Tract of above a hun|dred Leagues, the <HI>Kiang</HI> glides so gently, that the Ships may Sail up the same, with or against the Wind, and some Tides, especially Spring-Tides, (a strange thing to relate,) the Water running up so far in the Countrey, that Sea-Fish are there taken.</P>
<P>In this Stream lie several Isles, as <HI>Pequey,</HI> that is, of the white <HI>Tortel,</HI> in the third County <HI>Hoangcheufu,</HI> of the Province of <HI>Huquang.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>Yellow River,</HI> the second in Magnitude, and most famous in all <HI>China,</HI> and by them nam'd <HI>Hoang,</HI> is so call'd from the colour of the Water, occa|sion'd by the Yellow Mud or Clay Earth, which from the Spring to the Sea it glides over: It is always disturb'd and made thick by a Yellow Soil, which it carries along; because this Mud, which gives the denomination, and doth not as in other clear Waters, shine from the Ground, but discolours, being rais'd by the swift and strong Current of the Water (after the manner of Rivulets which swell by Rains) the whole River, as hath often been found by experience; for when its Water is for a little while put into a Vessel, or Glass, the sediment sinks so fast down to the bottom, that it makes almost a third part; and in|deed, this River at the first sight seems to be a Pool or flowing Mud, but the swift Current of its Waters manifests the contrary: Those that frequent this River, make the Water clear by casting in Allom, which drives the Lees to the Ground, and fills the fourth part of the Vessel. It is a great wonder, from whence such abundance of Clay or Mud proceeds, considering it hath never been seen clear or bright; nay, the <HI>Chineses</HI> say, That its Water cannot be clear in the time of a thousand Years, insomuch that they have a Proverb from thence amongst them, <HI>viz.</HI> when they speak of things that are never like to happen, as altogether impossible, they say, <HI>When the Yellow River shall be bright.</HI> Moreover, the <HI>Hoang,</HI> as a Foraigner, entering from without into <HI>China,</HI> takes Original out of the Southern <HI>Amasian</HI> Mountains, otherwise call'd <HI>Quonlun,</HI> and by the Inhabitants, <HI>Otunlao,</HI> which lie not far from the great <HI>Mogul's</HI> second Court, nam'd <HI>Laor,</HI> or from the Kingdom of <HI>Tibet;</HI> Nay, the situation of the places shew, that the River <HI>Ganges</HI> in <HI>Bengale,</HI> the <HI>Meson</HI> in <HI>Laor,</HI> and other fa|mous Rivers which moisten the Countries of <HI>Siam</HI> and <HI>Pegu,</HI> have their Origi|nals from these Mountains before-mention'd; for the <HI>Chineses</HI> also manifest, that many great Rivers, have their head Springs and Fountains there; leaving these Mountains, it runs by <HI>Sifan</HI> and <HI>Tanyu,</HI> a Tract of above 300 Leagues, with abundance of Water to the North-East, from whence descending to the East, it approaches <HI>China,</HI> near the County of <HI>Linyaofu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> at the West end of the <HI>Great Wall,</HI> along which it rushes, and passes on through a part
<PB N="616" REF="270">
of the Kingdom of <HI>Tanyu,</HI> between the Desart <HI>Karacatay,</HI> otherwise <HI>Samo;</HI> after|wards through the Desart it self, with a swift Course, and several Branches to the East and North, a Tract of two thousand Furlongs; from whence it turns South-West to <HI>China,</HI> and in forty Degrees and eighteen Minutes Nor|thern-Latitude, runs through the Gate <HI>Se</HI> in the <HI>Great Wall</HI> of <HI>China,</HI> and shoots along between the Province of <HI>Xansi</HI> and that of <HI>Xensi,</HI> and in the Latitude of thirty six Degrees enters into the Province of <HI>Honan,</HI> and out of that into the Province of <HI>Xantung,</HI> near the City <HI>Cao;</HI> from whence it runs towards the South-East, and passes on through the Northern part of the Province of <HI>Nan|king,</HI> and discharges it self at last with great violence into the Sea, in thirty two Degrees and a half Northern-Latitude.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hoang</HI> generally falls with such an incredible swiftness, that no Boats can Row against it, but are forc'd up with a far greater number of Toers than in the River <HI>Kiang.</HI> In some places it is above half a League, and others more, and extending it self in length above eight hundred Leagues, oftentimes rises above its Banks, and covers all the neighboring Countreys with Water and Mud. The <HI>Chineses</HI> describe the <HI>Hoang</HI> in these, or the like words:</P>
<Q>The original of the River <HI>Hoang</HI> is between the Southern Mountains of <HI>Quonlun</HI> or <HI>Amasian</HI> Hills, by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Otunlao.</HI> The Water which makes this River springs from above a hundred Fountains, which makes the Lake call'd <HI>Singcieu,</HI> which is forty Furlongs wide; the Water running out of it along a Channel makes another lesser Lake, from whence the <HI>Hoang</HI> runs Northward, through a little towards the East, and soon after washes the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> and runs direct East, then passing on Northward by the Sandy Fields or Wildernesses, from whence it streams Southward into <HI>China,</HI> and through the Province of <HI>Xantung</HI> discharges it self into the Sea. Thus far the <HI>Chinese</HI> Writer.</Q>
<P>In former times this River us'd also to run through the Province of <HI>Peking</HI> and <HI>Xantung,</HI> but its Course is since by the art and labor of the <HI>Chineses</HI> led ano|ther way, thereby to prevent the overflowing the fore-mention'd Countreys, which by reason of their Champain Lands that extend themselves a great way in breadth and length, should not be subject to its often inundating Streams; yet nevertheless the <HI>Chineses</HI> have left a little Branch thereof, as a testimony of its ancient Course thither.</P>

<P>There are also many deep-cut Channels, besides Lakes, Pools, and Springs, abounding in Fish.</P>

<HEAD>Standing&mdash;waters, or Channels.</HEAD>
<P>THe Countrey of <HI>China</HI> is cut thorow in many places with Moats or Ar|tificial Channels, for the conveniency of Navigation from one City to another.</P>
<P>Among many others, one of these Channels call'd <HI>Iun,</HI> deserves no small admiration, being with an incredible Charge digg'd from the Province of <HI>Nanking,</HI> through that of <HI>Xantung</HI> to the Metropolis of <HI>Peking;</HI> by means of which, from most places in the Empire, all sorts of Goods are brought in Ships to <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>It begins on the Northern Borders of the Province of <HI>Nanking</HI> in the County <HI>Hoaiganfu,</HI> Northward from the City <HI>Socien;</HI> near the Northern Shore of the <HI>Yellow River,</HI> out of which Ships from all parts of the Empire are brought into it; from thence it extends North-West through the second Territory <HI>Ien|cheufu</HI> of the Province of <HI>Xantung,</HI> to the City <HI>Cining,</HI> Southward from the Lake <HI>Nanyang;</HI> then through that of <HI>Tungchangfu,</HI> and the Lake <HI>Nanyang;</HI> from whence at last, at the end of the County, near the City <HI>Lincing,</HI> beyond the Lake <HI>Cang,</HI> it falls into the River <HI>Guei.</HI></P>
<P>But because the Water in this Channel is too shallow in many places for great Ships, therefore there are above twenty Sluces or Water-gates in the same, in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Tungpa,</HI> very strong and firm, of square Stone. Eve|ry Sluce hath a Gate or opening, lock'd with great Planks to keep out the Wa|ter, being by means of a Wheel and an Engine drawn up with little trouble, to give way for the Water and Ships, till you come to the second Gate, where they do the like, and so likewise at all the rest: But half way, before you come to the City <HI>Cining,</HI> they tap as much Water through a great Water-gate out of the Lake <HI>Cang,</HI> as they need; then Locking up the Gates again, keep the Wa|ter from running out too much, and so leaving the Ground bare, for the Wa|ter in the Lake is higher than the adjacent Countrey; so that in a small Tract of Land, they reckon above eight Water-gates, which resist the force and pow|er of the Water.</P>
<P>When the Ships are come to the Lake <HI>Cang</HI> it self, they cross not the same, but with much more ease, pass along a Channel made by the sides of the Lake, with brave Banks on each side: At every Water-gate are People which Toe the Ships by a Line through the Sluces, for a small reward.</P>
<P>In this manner the Ships go out of the <HI>Yellow River</HI> to <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>Certainly, should the best Builders or Surveyors of <HI>Europe</HI> come and behold the length of this Channel, or thickness and heighth of the Banks on each side, and the ornament of the Sluces, which are all of hewn Stone, they would justly wonder at the wisdom of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and their Industry, in undergoing that labor, which scarce any other People would be able to perform.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Peking,</HI> in the County of <HI>Pekingfu,</HI> near the City <HI>Cho,</HI> there is also a very long Channel call'd <HI>Tocang;</HI> another in the eighth County <HI>Xao|hingfu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> describ'd before; besides many more, which would be too tedious to mention.</P>

<P>On the South side, the Emperor made a third Lake, and near it a pleasant Court, call'd <HI>Silen,</HI> to solace himself in, after the end of those pretended Fights: He plac'd also in this Lake a great Stone&punc; Fish, rais'd, and fasten'd in the bot|tom of the Water like a Rock, that the Sea men Sailing by the same, might learn to shun Rocks and Shelves: Against Rainy weather (as the <HI>Chineses</HI> say) this Fish makes a hideous noise, the force whereof is imagin'd to be much ad|vantag'd by a Neighboring Eccho.

<P>IN the first little County, wherein stands the City <HI>Chin,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> the Air, in regard of the Countrey, lies very high, and is much colder than in other places; but in most parts of the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> the Air is pleasant and temperate.</P>
<P>It Rains very seldom in the Province of <HI>Xantung.</HI></P>
<P>In divers places of rhe Province of <HI>Honan</HI> the Air is very Temperate, and consequently Healthful; as likewise in the County <HI>Houiking.</HI></P>
<P>The Air of the Province of <HI>Fokien</HI> is generally hot, but clear and Healthful; except in the County <HI>Tincheufu.</HI></P>
<P>The Southern part of the Province of <HI>Quangsi,</HI> is under a warm Climate.</P>
<P>The Air of the Province of <HI>Iunnan</HI> is much hotter than that of the other Pro|vinces, as being nearer to the Line, and for the most part agreeing with that of <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>The Soil of the Province of <HI>Peking,</HI> is in most places Barren and Sandy, though Champain; but in the second County <HI>Paotingfu,</HI> very pleasant and Fruitful of all things; and so likewise in the seventh Territory <HI>Tamingfu:</HI> In the eighth County of this Province grows the Root <HI>Gingten.</HI></P>
<P>In the Jurisdiction of the City <HI>Yenking,</HI> the first of the three Cities without

the bounds of the Province of <HI>Peking,</HI> are store of Vines; yet the Inhabitants know not how, or rather (which is most probable) will not make Wine of Grapes, but content themselves with Liquors made of Rice, which are ex|ceeding good, and so well approv'd of by the Jesuits, who went thither from <HI>Europe,</HI> that they us'd no Liquor else, except at Mass.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Xansi</HI> produces Vineyards and Grapes, much sweeter than in other parts in <HI>China;</HI> so that the <HI>Chineses,</HI> if they would, might make excel|lent Wine in great abundance; but in stead thereof, they have a way of drying their Grapes like Raisins, which, when so order'd, are Vended in all parts of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>The Fathers which Promulgated the Gospel in this Province, took a conve|nient course to Press their Wine themselves which they use at Mass, and fur|nish'd others of their Fraternity in the Neighboring Provinces therewith; whereas, formerly with great trouble and charge they sent for their Wine from the City <HI>Makao.</HI></P>

<P>The Province of <HI>Xensi</HI> is more subject to Drought than any other Province, and very often infinitely endamag'd by swarms of Locusts, which like a vast Army devour the Fruits of the Earth, and lay waste all before them: This Pro|vince particularly produces the Physical Plant <HI>Rhubarb.</HI></P>
<P>The first County <HI>Siganfu,</HI> of the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> hath both Pleasant Moun|tains and Fruitful Plains, producing all store of Fruits and other Provision: The second likewise is both Manur'd, and not behind in natural Fertility.</P>

<P>The first County <HI>Cinunfu,</HI> yields not, for pleasure, to any other of the Nor|thern Provinces, for all manner of Grain or Fruits, especially Wheat and Rice, which grow there in great abundance.</P>
<P>In like manner, the second County <HI>Yeucheufu</HI> hath many delightful Fields, Wooddy Mountains, and in most places, is well Cultivated.</P>
<P>The third County <HI>Tungchangfu</HI> hath a Plain and Rich Soil, produces great store of Grain, and wants in a manner nothing of what is requisite for the su|staining of Mans Life.</P>
<P><PB N="671" REF="297">The Province of <HI>Honan</HI> is in some parts Champain, and in others Moun|tainous, especially Westward; yet the Soil being every where Fruitful, no place lies Untill'd, except towards the West, where several craggy Mountains ob|struct the Husbandmans Labor: The Fields produce Rice, and all other sorts of Grain: They have all manner of <HI>European</HI> Fruits, and that in such abun|dance, that they are bought at very cheap Rates; so that it is no wonder this Province is by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>A Paradice of Delight;</HI> for the Eastern part there|of is so pleasant, and every where so improv'd by Tillage, that those who shall for several days Travel through the same, may fancy they walk through a most delightful Garden.</P>

<P>The whole Territory <HI>Chingtufu</HI> is partly Champain, and in some parts with Mountains; the Plains are inrich'd by Natures Hand, and the very Moun|tainous parts by good Tillage, are made Fruitful; all the Fields are Water'd by Rivulets, either Natural or Cut, insomuch, that whoe're Travels through them, hath, for three days, an exceeding pleasant Journey.</P>
<P>In the County <HI>Paoningfu,</HI> of the Province of <HI>Suchuen,</HI> in a <HI>Pagod</HI>-Temple in the great City <HI>Kien,</HI> grows an <HI>Indian</HI> Fig-tree, in the <HI>Portuguese</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Arvor de Rayes.</HI></P>

<P>The Territory <HI>Queicheufu,</HI> Fruitful of its self, is also by the Inhabitants very much improv'd by Tillage, no spot of Ground being left Unmanur'd, except some Sandy and Stony Mountains, which lie especially towards the North: Among other excellent Fruits, this Countrey abounds in Oranges and Lemons.</P>
<P>The first little County, wherein stands the City <HI>Tungchun,</HI> is exceedingly in|rich'd by the abundance of Rivers which Water the same.</P>
<P>The small Territory belonging to the City <HI>Kiating,</HI> is a pleasant place, and yields plenty of Rice and other Grains.</P>

<P>The County <HI>Vuchangfu</HI> is advantag'd by the many Streams and Channels that run through the same, and along whose Banks grow abundance of Reeds, of which they make Paper.</P>
<P>The second <HI>Honia,</HI> among other things, produces in particular great plenty of Lemons, Oranges, and Cytrons: Nor are the fifth and sixth Territories in|ferior; which last yields all manner of Provisions.</P>
<P>The seventh County <HI>Iocheufu,</HI> is very much inrich'd by three Rivers, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Kiang, Siang,</HI> and <HI>Fungi,</HI> and brings forth incomparable Fruits, especially Oran|ges and Lemons.</P>
<P>The eighth County <HI>Changxafu,</HI> generally Champain, but in some places Mountainous, hath a fat and fertile Soil, and plenty of all things, Rice grow|ing there in abundance, without danger of withering in the dryest Seasons, because there seldom wants Rain, which if there should, the Husband-man supplies it sufficiently with Water, which by an Engine is drawn out of the Lakes and Streams over their Fields, so to moisten the Roots of their Plants.</P>
<P>The County <HI>Hengcheufu</HI> is a delightful and well Till'd Countrey, yielding all manner of Provisions, and among the rest, Paper-canes: Much of the same Nature are the tenth and fourteenth Counties.</P>
<P>In the Territory <HI>Chingyangfu</HI> grows a Plant, which like our Ivy runs up in height, bears Yellow Flowers, and some White. The utmost end of the Sprigs are very thin, like Silken Threds; they say, that a small Branch thereof being laid to the Naked Body, occasions Sleep, and therefore is call'd <HI>Munghao,</HI> that is, <HI>Flower of Sleep.</HI></P>
<P>The County <HI>Nanchangfu,</HI> the first of the Province of <HI>Kiangfi,</HI> having every where a fruitful and fat Soil, is Till'd in most places: In like manner, the se|cond Territory <HI>Iaocheufu</HI> is made very pregnant by several Rivers that run through it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> also esteem the fourth County <HI>Nankangfu,</HI> for its affording them all kind of Necessaries; the low Grounds yielding plenty of Rice, Corn, and Shell-Fruit; the Mountains store of Wood for Fuel.</P>
<P>The sixth County <HI>Kienchangfu,</HI> is, though Mountainous, a Pleasant and Fer|tile Countrey; as likewise the seventh <HI>Vuchenfu,</HI> (through which run many Rivers) it yields store of Gold-colour'd Apples; nor is it wanting in all sorts of Fruit and other Provisions: No less Pleasant and Fruitful is the eighth County <HI>Lingkiangfu,</HI> esteem'd by the <HI>Chineses;</HI> as also the ninth <HI>Kieganfu,</HI> though Hilly and Mountainous: But above all, the tenth Territory <HI>Xuicheufu,</HI> a|bounds in Rice-Fields; as appears by its paying three thousand Bags of Rice for Custom Yearly; when as it contains onely three Cities, of which, the chief at this day call'd <HI>Xuicheu,</HI> was in the time of the Family <HI>Tang</HI> nam'd <HI>Micheu,</HI> that is, <HI>City of Rice:</HI> Not much short of this in plenty is the eleventh County <HI>Iuencheufu.</HI></P>
<P>The fourth County <HI>Sunkiangfu,</HI> of the Province of <HI>Kiangnan,</HI> though small, is not to be left out of the Fruitful Countries: The fifth <HI>Changcheufu,</HI> being a plain Countrey and Water'd by several Rivers, exceeds many other Territories in the goodness of its Soil; producing an excellent kind of Grain. The seventh <HI>Yan|cheufu</HI> hath also a delightful and fertile Soyl.</P>

<P>The Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> by reason of the many Brooks, Rivers and Lakes which wash the same, is a rich Magazine of Plenty: And though <HI>Chokiang</HI> hath many Mountains on its South and West parts, yet they are all Till'd&punc; ex|cept those which are stony; and they also afford Timber, fit for the building of Ships or Houses. In most parts are store of Mulberry Trees, which are Prun'd yearly like our Vines, thereby the better to provide Food for the Silk-Worms; for the <HI>Chineses</HI> suffer them not to grow too high, having by the expe|rience of many years learn'd, that the Leaves of the Orange-Trees, and those that are most kept down, yield the best Silk.</P>

<P>The Province of <HI>Fokien</HI> is for the most part over&punc;spread with Mountains, which in many places are cover'd with pleasant Woods, especially on steep Ascents: The Timber is good for the building of Ships, Houses, and the like. That part also which is plain, is for the most part Sandy and unfit for Tillage: but to supply that defect, the Water is led thither in little Channels, whereby those places that are barren by Nature, are rendred productive by the Art and Industry of Man.</P>
<P>The sixth County <HI>Tingcheufu</HI> hath abundance of all things requisite for the subsistance of Mankind, notwithstanding it is very Mountainous.</P>
<P>The seventh Territory <HI>Hinghoafu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> is the fertilest and pleasantest in the whole Countrey, and especially abounding in Rice, as ap|pears by its paying seventy two thousand Bags of Tribute, whereas it onely contains two Cities.</P>
<P>The little Territory of the City <HI>Foning</HI> hath also plenty of Provision, not|withstanding it is every where full of Mountains.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Quantung</HI> is a rich Store-house of Plenty: The Fields are so bountiful in the production of Rice and Wheat, that they are Sown twice a year, each Harvest yielding the Husband-man a most plentiful Crop, by rea|son the whole Province feels neither Frost nor Snow, insomuch that the <HI>Chi|neses</HI> have a Proverb concerning it, <HI>viz.

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of their manner of Husbandry.</HEAD>
<P>AS to what concerns Husbandry, no People in the World are more skil|ful and experienc'd than the <HI>Chineses:</HI> They say (and not without some Ground) that a Man may live without all Arts, except that of Husbandry, which is amongst them esteem'd the onely Business of Conse|quence. They say continually that Husbandry is the greatest and chiefest

Work of the Empire, and that even Kings and Magistrates ought seriously to concern themselves in it. And it comes to pass by the great Priviledges and Encouragements allow'd to the Husband-man, that not one Spot of Land is left unimprov'd, if it be either naturally fruitful, or can be made so by Art: and because it is a great part of their care to keep their Ground in heart by frequent Dunging and Manuring, they use many more sorts of Dung than are in use amongst us, as Man's Dung, Ox Legs stamp'd, Hogs Bristles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> insomuch, that the <HI>Chineses,</HI> though stor'd with great abundance of preci|ous things, nothing is lost, how mean soever it is, but is all improv'd to the great benefit of the whole Empire. Where there is want of Water, it is con|vey'd, though a considerable way, out of the Rivers, along digg'd Channels; (by which means all <HI>China</HI> is made Navigable) and conducted from low to high places by means of an Engine made of four square Planks holding great store of Water, which with Iron Chains they hale up like Buckets. It is re|ported, that several of their Emperors and Empresses did in ancient times pra|ctise Husbandry.</P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>Ven,</HI> who began his Reign <HI>Anno</HI> 197 before the <HI>Incarnation,</HI> pro|moted Husbandry, then decay'd by the continual Wars, with great zeal, and put his own Hands to the Work, that by his Example he might oblige all the greatest Noble-men to follow him. He caus'd all Women to plant Mul|bery-Trees, and breed Silk-Worms, from the Example of his Empress, whom he enjoyn'd to set the fore-mention'd Trees, and breed Silk-Worms in his Pa|lace; insomuch that all the Clothes she wore, and which were us'd in their Religious Ceremonies, were of her making.</P>
<P>It is credible that from hence the high Feast, which the <HI>Chineses</HI> call <HI>Hinchun,</HI> hath its original: This may well be term'd <HI>The Countrey-man's Holiday;</HI> for in the beginning of the Spring, when the Sun is in the <HI>Aequator,</HI> this Day is by the <HI>Chineses</HI> through the whole Empire kept with great Solemnity, by all de|grees of Persons in every City, and in the Metropolis <HI>Peking</HI> it self after this manner:</P>
<P><PB N="676" REF="300">One of the chiefest of the Nobility, Crown'd with a Garland of Flowers, goes to the Eastern Gate of the City, with all manner of Instruments Playing before him, and attended with a number of burning Torches and Flags. Behind fol|low a Train of Men, which carry several Dishes of Meat to Trees, whereon hang the ancient Monuments of Husbandry, being either made of Wood or some other Material, and set forth with Silk and Cloth of Gold. In several places through which they pass, stand Triumphal Arches, and all the Streets are hung with Tapestry. In this manner the Nobleman goes to the Eastern Gate, as it were, to meet the approaching Spring.</P>
<P>The chiefest Pageantries of this Solemnity are, A Cow of Bak'd Clay, so big, that forty Men are scarce able to carry it: The other is a Youth, whom they call <HI>The Careful and Industrious Spirit,</HI> who going bare with one Leg, and the other cover'd with a Stocking, continually strikes the Cow on the Back with a Switch: Then follow divers Countrey-men, carrying Spades, Shovels, Axes, and the like Tools, us'd in Husbandry; yet nothing of what they carry or do, but represents a peculiar Secret; as by the continual beating on the Cow, they signifie, what care the Husband-man must take in the Manuring of his Lands; by the Youths going with one Leg bare, and the other antick|ly clad, they express what speed they must use to go to their Labor, and scarce allow time to Clothe themselves.</P>
<P>When the whole Train is led to the King's or Governor's Palace, the Stone Cow is bereav'd of all her Garlands and other Ornamentals: Out of her open'd Belly (like as from the <HI>Trojan</HI> Horse) little Clayie Oxen are drawn in great numbers, of which the Emperor sends one to every Governor, with ad|monishments, that the Subjects would be careful and diligent in the Tilling of their Lands, and leave not an Acre unsow'd; and among other Ceremonies, the Emperor himself Plows, and throws Seed on the Ground that day.</P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>Hiaou,</HI> though when he was grown very old, betook himself three years before his Death to Husbandry, and forsaking all kind of State Af|fairs, Plough'd and Sow'd the Ground himself, that by that means he might shew good examples to his Subjects, and stir them up in like manner to Hus|bandry: Then enquiring out experienc'd Planters, commanded them to go through his whole Dominions, and teach all People the way of Husbandry: to which purpose, they found out all sorts of Implements or Tools useful in Tillage, and many other the like things which are requir'd in Husbandry; so that we may now cease from wondering, that formerly mean Rusticks were rais'd from the Plough to the Imperial Throne and sole <HI>Monarchy</HI> of all <HI>China,</HI> when we see that Emperors descended from the Throne to the Plough, nay, which is more, manag'd the Empire and the Plough at once.</P>
<P>The ancient <HI>Chinese</HI> Emperors and Kings have had several Laws concerning<NOTE PLACE="marg">Laws for Husbandry.</NOTE> Husbandry, amongst which were these.</P>
<P><HI>The nineteenth part of whatsoe're the Soil produces, falls to the Emperor.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Governors ought in time of Famine to take notice of the Subjects Goods and Estates, and Tax them according to their Quality.</HI></P>
<P>The dividing of the Ground was after this manner; every Person was to have an equal share, and one Family no more than the other: All the Fields were divided into great Squares, and these again into nine lesser, of which each Person had one to Manure; but the middlemost was either the Empe|ror's or the King's Square, which was also by eight Overseers Till'd on the Emperor's Account.</P>
<P><PB N="677" REF="300">The eight Squares were call'd <HI>Peculiar Acres,</HI> but the middlemost, <HI>The Cammon or Free Square,</HI> which when left Untill'd, no Man was permitted to Manure his own.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He Reign'd <HI>Anno</HI> 2837. before the Nativity.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Emperor <HI>Xinnung</HI> first Invented the Plough and other Necessary things for Husbandry, and taught the Inhabitants to Sow Wheat, Rice, Barly, <HI>Maiz</HI> or <HI>Turkish</HI> Corn, and other Grains.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin.

<P>The Emperor <HI>Yu,</HI> who Raign'd <HI>Anno</HI> 2207. before the <HI>Nativity,</HI> hath written many things concerning Tillage, <HI>viz.</HI> after what manner the Fields of every County, are to be Till'd and Sown; for he had gain'd excellent knowledge of the Nature of several Soils, to which he attain'd by his own Industry: And observing their Situation among Rivers, concerning which he also wrote seve|ral Treatises, and from his Writings the <HI>Chineses</HI> observe several Rules in their Tilling, according to the several qualities of the Ground.</P>
<P>The Mountains are also in <HI>China</HI> Manur'd after a peculiar manner, but in no Province so much, as in that of <HI>Fokien,</HI> because there are the most Moun|tains.</P>
<P><HI>Michael Boem</HI> observes, that the Countrey of <HI>China</HI> is exceeding fruitful, not onely in the producing of <HI>Indian,</HI> (especially the Southern Provinces) but also all sorts of <HI>European</HI> Fruits, besides others, solely belonging to it self: It is a wonder to consider, how many excellent Fruits the Inhabitants in the fifteen Provinces of <HI>China</HI> enjoy; for those Provinces which want any sorts of Fruits are furnish'd by their Neighbors with those which they have not; by which means they have all the Year long fresh Fruits, even in the midst of Winter; for in some Provinces, the Fruits are ripe in <HI>November, December, Ianuary,</HI> and <HI>February;</HI> in others, in <HI>March, April, May</HI> and <HI>Iune;</HI> and in some, in <HI>Iuly, August, September</HI> and <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>The manner of Nursing up of young Plants amongst the <HI>Chineses</HI> and most <HI>Indians</HI> is three several ways: The first is by burying of the Fruit and Seed toge|ther in the Ground; for the <HI>Chinese</HI> Gardners put whole Golden Apples and other Fruits in the Earth, and then Plant the Sprouts which shoot from the Seed at a distance from one another, by which means they grow in a short time to be great Trees, and bear excellent Fruit.</P>
<P>They Graff their Trees also after the same manner as we do ours; and not onely Graff Trees, but also Flowers, by which means, one Stalk, if Graffed, bears several Flowers of divers shapes and Colours the next Year.</P>
<P>The third way of Nursing up of Plants, is by Lopping, as they do in Vine|yards, and by cutting off Sprigs from old Trees, and Planting them again; after which manner they increase their <HI>Manga</HI> and <HI>Goyava;</HI> sometimes onely the Leaves, as the <HI>Paparja,</HI> which in a short time run up to be high Trees.</P>
<P>It is to be observ'd in Trees, of what size or sort soever, the <HI>Chineses</HI> intend should speedily grow to Perfection and produce Fruit, they Plant the cut-off Branches that day when the Sun enters the fifteenth Degree of <HI>Capricorn,</HI> which never fails to shoot forth in a short time; for they have either observ'd by ex|perience, or learnt from the Ancients from time to time, that onely this day is fit for that business, <HI>viz.</HI> that if a Sprig of what Tree soever be Planted or set in the Ground on that day, it will very suddenly become a Fruit&punc;bearing Tree.</P>

<P>DIvers sorts of strange Herbs, Trees, Roots, Canes, and Flowers grow in the Countrey of <HI>China,</HI> some of which are proper to <HI>China</HI> onely; others again common to that, with other Countries, especially <HI>India.</HI> Most of the Provinces yield each of them many Herbs, which are of a strange Soveraign Vertue.</P>
<P>In the seventh County <HI>Kingyangfu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> grows an Herb<NOTE PLACE="marg">Herb <HI>Kinsu.</HI></NOTE> in manner like a Tuft of Yellow Hair, wherefore it is call'd <HI>Kinsu,</HI> that is, <HI>Silk of Gold,</HI> or <HI>Golden Thred of Silk-worms,</HI> for <HI>Kin</HI> signifies <HI>Gold,</HI> and <HI>Su, Silk:</HI> It is of a bitterish Taste, but more cooling than heating; cures suddenly all man|ner of Scabs and Breakings-out in the Body, without leaving the least Spot behind.</P>
<P>In the same County is a sort of Rice, exceeding good to cleanse the Body, and especially to provoke Urine: There are also several sorts of Beans, which are an excellent Remedy against Poyson.</P>

<P>None but that which is Wild, being of a Reddish Colour within, is brought over to us: It is not so big as the true and Tame Root, neither hath it that Pow|er, yet is not altogether void of Efficacy.</P>
<P>The true Root, as they say, grows onely in the Province of <HI>Suchuen,</HI> under the Ground, in old Woods of Pine-Trees, almost after the same manner as <HI>Po|tatoes</HI> in <HI>India;</HI> wherefore the <HI>Chineses</HI> write, that it grows from a tough Slime or Pitch of the Pine-Tree, which dropping on the Earth, fastens in the Ground, and becomes a Plant, which spreading all about over the Earth, breeds a Root under Ground, sometimes as big as a Childs Head, and in Weight and Form not unlike Coco-nuts, from which the Shell or Rind doth not differ much, though not so hard and thick, but much weaker and thinner; under the Rind

is a Kernel or white Spungy Flesh, which is highly esteem'd by the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and us'd amongst their Medicines; yet if they want this, they despise not the fore-mention'd Wild sort, though it is not altogether of so powerful an Ope|ration.</P>
<P>The Wild <HI>China</HI>-Root grows also in <HI>Cochin-China,</HI> on the Coast of <HI>Malabar,</HI> and several other places in <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>China</HI>-Root, as <HI>Michael Boem</HI> writes, is by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Pe Folcin;</HI> by the <HI>Portuguese, Pao de Cina;</HI> and in <HI>Europe, China,</HI> among the <HI>Chineses</HI> it grows only in the Provinces of <HI>Iunnan, Quamsi, Quantum, Kaoli,</HI> and <HI>Leaotum:</HI> The Plant or Tree is surrounded with many Thorns, which touch not the Leaves.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> eat the Pith of the Root of this Tree in Broth, which is whol|some and us'd against the Gout, Ulcers, Stoppings in the Stomach, Lameness, Dropsie, Pain in the Legs and Body, and many other Distempers; the heaviest of them is accounted the best, and the White esteem'd before the Red: The Powder of this Root taken with Sugar, and us'd like a Conserve, is generally with good success given against Distempers in the Breast. They say, that the use and knowledge of this Root was <HI>Anno</HI> 1535. by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> brought into <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Another Bastard <HI>China</HI>-Root of the same Vertue, as the Wild Root, grows in <HI>Brasile,</HI> especially in the Province of <HI>Parayba,</HI> where the Inhabitants call it <HI>Ivaspecanga.</HI></P>
<P>In the eighth County <HI>Iungpingfu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Peking;</HI> and in that of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Root <HI>Ginseng.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Xansi</HI> near the City <HI>Leao,</HI> grows the most excellent and famous Root in all <HI>Chi|na,</HI> by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Ginseng,</HI> and by the <HI>Iapanners, Nisi.</HI> The <HI>Chinese</HI> name <HI>Ginseng</HI> is taken from the shape, because it represents a Man (in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Gin</HI>) striding with his Legs; it is much smaller than our <HI>Man|dragora,</HI> or <HI>Mandrake;</HI> yet we need not doubt but it is a sort of it, because it is exactly like it, and hath the same Operation. The dry'd Root is of a yellow Colour, hath very few or scarce any Strings, by which it draws Nourishment; is streak'd round about with blackish Vains, as if drawn with Ink; yields when chaw'd an unpleasant sweetness, being mix'd with bitterness; a quar|ter of an Ounce of this Root taken in Syrup, exceedingly revives the Spirits, and if taken in a greater quantity, strengthens those that are Sick and Weak, and pleasantly warms the whole Body.</P>
<P>Those that are of a hot and strong Constitution indanger their Lives by using the same, because of its too much increasing and heighthning the Spirits; but on the contrary, it recovers those that by long Sicknesses or other Causes are consum'd and grown weak. It oftentimes restores those that lie a dying, and with the help of some other Physick restores them to their Health again. Many other Vertues the <HI>Chineses</HI> ascribe to this Root, and give three pound of Gold for one pound of it. The same Root is sometimes to be had in <HI>Holland;</HI> but because of its excessive dearness is little us'd.</P>
<P>The Provinces of <HI>Xensi</HI> and <HI>Suchuen,</HI> according to <HI>Martinius,</HI> bring forth ex|cellent Medicines, especially the Root <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Taihoang.</HI> This Root (says he) grows not wild, as some affirm, but on the con|trary requires great care and pains in the Planting of it: it is of a yellow Co|lour streak'e with Flames, not hollow, but firm and hard, and in som places having Knobs and Swellings: The Leaves are somewhat like our Cabbage Leaves, but much bigger. The <HI>Chineses</HI> make a Hole through the Root, and hang them out to dry in the Shade, for being dry'd in the Sun they lose their Vertue.</P>
<P><PB N="680" REF="302">Most of the <HI>Rhubarb</HI> which is brought into <HI>Europe,</HI> comes for the most part out of the Provinces of <HI>Xensi</HI> and <HI>Suchuen;</HI> being brought from <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Persia</HI> by Sea to <HI>Batavia,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Holland;</HI> or else out of <HI>China</HI> by Land to <HI>Kaskar, Astrakan</HI> and <HI>Russia,</HI> or through <HI>Thebet</HI> and <HI>Persia</HI> by <HI>Venice</HI> to <HI>Italy;</HI> for those of <HI>Tebet</HI> and <HI>Mogor</HI> frequent the Province of <HI>Suchuen,</HI> and from thence bring the <HI>Rhubarb</HI> hither. Thus far <HI>Martinius.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Matthiolus</HI> gives us another Description of <HI>Rhubarb</HI> in his <HI>Comment</HI> upon <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">s|corides,</HI> which agrees with that of <HI>Michael Boem,</HI> in his <HI>Chinese Flora,</HI> and with <HI>Baptista Ramusio,</HI> formerly Secretary to the <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Venice,</HI> in his <HI>Preface</HI> before the <HI>Voyage</HI> of <HI>Marcus Paulus Venetus,</HI> which is to this effect&punc;</P>
<P>Though (say they) <HI>Rhubarb</HI> grows in all parts of <HI>China,</HI> yet it grows in greater abundance in the Provinces of <HI>Suciven,</HI> (perhaps <HI>Suchuen</HI>) <HI>Xensi,</HI> and in the Jurisdiction of the City <HI>Socieu</HI> near the <HI>Great Wall,</HI> than in any other place. The Earth in which it grows is red and Clayie, occasion'd by its being conti|nually moistned with Springs and Rain: The Leaves, according to the Plant, are two Handfuls long, narrow below, broad at the end, and the edges there|of cover'd with a hairy Wool: When they are come to their f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ll growth and maturity, they immediately grow yellow and lank: The Stalk shoots a Hands|breadth with the Leaves above the Earth; from the middle of the Leaf runs a thin Stalk, which bears Flowers not unlike a great Pink; likewise towards the top, which is of a sharp and strong smell: The Root or Stalk which is in the Ground, is of a dark Copper colour, one, two, and sometimes three Hand|fuls long, and as thick as a Man's Arm; from which shoot forth other lesser Roots, which are cut off from the same. The Root <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> when cut asun|der, shews a dark yellow Flesh streak'd with red Veins, out of which drops a red slimy Juice. Moreover, if any one immediately hangs these moist pieces up to dry, then, as experience hath taught, the moisture instantly vanishes, and the Root growing very light, loses all its Vertue; therefore those who are ex|perienc'd herein, first lay the pieces of green <HI>Rhubarb</HI> on Tables, and turn them twice or thrice in a day, that so the Sap or Juice may soak and dry by degrees into the pieces, and remain in them; four days after, when the moisture is dry'd up, they put the pieces on Strings, and hang them from the Sun in the Shadow to dry by the Wind.</P>
<P>The best time to dig up the <HI>Rhubarb</HI> is in the Winter before the Trees begin<NOTE PLACE="marg">Or rather in Spring&punc; as <HI>Ramusio</HI> will have it&punc;</NOTE> to Bud, because at that time (about the beginning of <HI>April</HI>) the Juice and Vertue unites and gathers together. But if the Root of <HI>Rhubarb</HI> be digg'd up in Summer, or at that time when it sends forth green Leaves, which is a sign of its not being ripe, then it never comes to the perfection of the <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> which is digg'd up in the Winter.</P>
<P>One Wagon full of <HI>Rhubarb</HI> Roots which is full of moisture, costs one <HI>Scudo</HI> and a half: The Juice when dry'd up abates so much of the weight, that of seven Pound of green, there scarce remains one Pound when dress'd. The <HI>Chi|neses</HI> call it <HI>Tayhuan,</HI> that is, <HI>High Yellow.</HI></P>
<P>This Plant is discours'd of at large by the fore mention'd Authors, and par|ticularly <HI>Michael Boem</HI> makes a curious Disquisition, whether the <HI>Rhaponticum</HI> of <HI>Alpinus</HI> be the same with that which is commonly brought out of <HI>Muscovy,</HI> and takes much pains to prove that that which grows in <HI>China</HI> is much better than that which is brought by <HI>Russia</HI> into <HI>Europe.</HI></P>

<HI>Lichias:</HI> but in greater abundance in the Southern parts of the Province of <HI>Fokien;</HI> yet the best sort in the County <HI>Hinghoafu:</HI> It grows on very large and high Trees, whose Leaves resemble those of a Laurel-Tree: On the tops of the Boughs hang Clusters of Fruit like Grapes, not altogether so thick, but on longer Stalks: It bears the shape of a Deers Heart, and is as big as a <HI>Coco</HI>-Nut, having a thin shrubby and knotty Shell, like that of a Pine-Apple, which may easily be pull'd off with the Fingers: within is a white juicy Kernel of a pleasant taste, and smelling like a Rose: The ripe Fruits are of a Purple colour, so that the Trees shew as if hung round about with Purple Hearts, a Sight delightful to behold: within the Flesh is a Stone, which the smaller it is, the better the Fruit is esteem'd of.</P>
<P>This Fruit may justly be call'd <HI>The King of Fruits,</HI> since in so ample a mea|sure it both delights the Eye and pleases the Palate, which seems never satisfi'd therewith: The Kernel of it melts in the Mouth like Sugar.</P>
<P>Another Fruit nam'd <HI>Lungyen,</HI> that is, <HI>Dragons-Eye,</HI> grows in <HI>China;</HI> it is not<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Fruit <HI>Lungyen,</HI> or <HI>Dragons-Eye.</HI></NOTE> much unlike the former, though smaller and rounder like our Cherries; but the Shell of the Fruit <HI>Lichi</HI> is somewhat harder and thicker.

They also press a Juice out of the Fruit <HI>Lichi,</HI> which the <HI>Chineses</HI> call <HI>Wine,</HI> which is very sweet, but very scarce to be had. The ripe Fruit <HI>Lichi</HI> is generally brought fresh out of the County <HI>Chinkingfu.</HI></P>
<P>A particular Description of both these Fruits may be seen in the foremen|tion'd<NOTE PLACE="marg">Flor. Sin.</NOTE> Author <HI>Michael Boem,</HI> in his Book call'd <HI>Flores sinarum regionis.</HI></P>

<P>In the County <HI>Changtefu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Huquang,</HI> grow all sorts of Golden Apples; amongst which are some that by the <HI>Chineses</HI> are call'd <HI>Winter Apples,</HI> for when all the others fall off, these begin to grow ripe, and are of a sweet taste.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Kiangsi</HI> and other places, grows (for the most part in Lakes and standing Waters) a Plant with a Flower, by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Lien,</HI> and by the <HI>Portuguese, Fula de Golfon.</HI></P>
<P>The Flower <HI>Lien</HI> shoots up two or three Yards above the Water on hard and strong Stalks, and is of several Colours, as Purple, White, Parti-colour'd, Red, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> onely Yellow is a Colour peculiar to those that grow in <HI>Iuncheufu,</HI> a County of the Province of <HI>Huquang.</HI></P>
<P>This Flower exceeds our Lilies in bigness, and much more in beauty, but is in scent rather worse than better. We should call this Flower <HI>The great Lilie,</HI> because it differs not much in fashion, especially when it opens its Leaves.</P>
<P>To this Plont belongs also a sort of Fruit like a Ninepin, which is above a Span lang, and a Hand thick. The top or point of this Fruit is fast to the Stalk, on which the Flower hung before, the Cod stands upright, and hath se|veral

Partitions fill'd with Fruits bigger than Hazle-Nuts, or <HI>French</HI> Beans: each Fruit is without cover'd with a green Rind, and within fill'd up with a white Kernel, or Pith of a delightful taste, whether fresh or dry'd.</P>
<P>This Fruit is by the <HI>Chinese</HI> Physicians highly esteem'd, and accounted an excellent Food; wherefore they are generally given to sick Persons that are upon their recovery.</P>
<P>The Leaves of this Plant are very big, sometimes two Handfuls broad, and for the most part round: They lie and drive on the Water like those of our Water-Lilies, and joyn by long Stalks to the Root. The Root, which is thicker than a Mans Arm, sends forth a very fine Stalk two or three Ells long, di|stinguish'd with Joynts like a Cane: The outward Shell is firm and whole, but the Flesh is parted, and in several divisions: The dry'd Leaves are by Grocers and other Tradesmen us'd in stead of Paper to wrap or wind their Wares in. The Root also is very excellent, and esteem'd a Dainty of great value in the Summer, when it is taken to cool and expel Heat; so that nothing belongs to this Plant but what is useful.</P>
<P>In <HI>China</HI> are whole Lakes (a pleasant thing to behold) overgrown with Flowers, not wild, but produc'd by Art, by throwing once a year the Seed into the Water. Moreover, divers Persons of Quality keep great Earthen Vessels fill'd with Slime and Water in their Gardens, wherein they Sowe the foremention'd Flowers.</P>
<P>In the Lake <HI>Hung,</HI> on the East side of the City <HI>Hoaigan</HI> in the Province of <HI>Kiangnan,</HI> grows a kind of high Reed, which by the Inhabitants of the whole County are burnt in stead of Wood, very few Trees growing in that Coun|trey.</P>

<P>In the same County grows also a Tree call'd <HI>Kieuyen,</HI> which produces a<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Kieuyen,</HI> or <HI>Fat-Flower.</HI></NOTE> kind of fat substance like Tallow, of which pure white Candles are made, and are not subject to grease the Fingers though often handled, like those which are of Tallow. The Tree hath pretty big Leaves, somewhat like those of our Pear-Tree, with white Blossoms like our Cherry-Trees: after the Blossom follows a round Cod as big as a Cherry, cover'd with a blackish thin Skin, which incloses a white Pith appearing through the Skin, which cracks when the Cod is grown ripe. The Cods thus ripe, are pull'd off and boyl'd in Wa|ter; by which means the Flesh melting, becomes perfect Tallow when grown cold again; then the remaining Kernel being press'd produces store of Oyl, which they use not in Sallets, but burn in Lamps: In the Winter the Leaves are quite red like Copper, which is pleasant to behold, for they appear at a distance like Red-woods: At last the Leaves falling off afford excellent

<P>The Shore of the River <HI>Tao,</HI> in the County <HI>Xaocheufu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> is all Planted with Peach-Trees, from whence it hath its Denomi|nation, for <HI>Tao</HI> signifies <HI>A Peach.</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> prepare many Dainties of this Flower, both to please the Pa|late, and to delight the Smell.

<P>This Tree (a strange thing!) hath no Branches, but onely Leaves, which grow on the top thereof; from amongst which Leaves sprout out white Flow|ers, which afterwards become Fruit. The Fruit hath no set-time of the Year to ripen in, but successively ripe Fruits are to be found on the Trees every Moneth in the Year. The <HI>Chineses</HI> call it <HI>Fanyaycocu,</HI> that is, <HI>Fruit of the Fanyay;</HI> for <HI>Kocu</HI> signifies <HI>Fruit;</HI> and the <HI>Portuguese, Maman,</HI> because it hangs on the Tree like a Teat. The Fruit, Leaves, and whole Tree, are pleasant and de|lightful to the Eye. The Tree springs first from the Seed of its Fruit, and af|terwards new Trees from the Strings which shoot out of the Root: The Leaves and part of the Body of the Tree being put into the Ground, grow very speedily and in a short time to a high Tree.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1626. the <HI>Papayo</HI>-Tree being Sow'n, grew in <HI>Naples:</HI> It had a whitish

Root full of Strings, a whitish Stem or Body, eighteen Inches long and a Fin|ger thick, of the same colour with the Root, spongy and round, not unlike the Body of the <HI>Wonder-Tree,</HI> and notch'd after the same manner under the Leaves, which when green hang by a long Stalk round about the Body of the Tree, sloaping from the middle upwards, all of them four or five Inches broad, divi|ded like the Fig-Leaves into five parts, but notch'd much deeper, smooth, and of a pleasant Green; all of them fell off in the Winter, and the Body with the Root also wither'd away by degrees: But we may doubt whether this Tree was the right <HI>Papayo,</HI> because, according to <HI>Michael Boem,</HI> the <HI>Fanyacu,</HI> or <HI>Papayo,</HI> hath its Leaves onely on the top, and not as this in <HI>Naples,</HI> from the middle upwards.</P>
<P><HI>Peter de Valla,</HI> by Letters to <HI>Fabius Columna,</HI> gives quite another Description of the <HI>Papayo,</HI> which (saith he) is a Plant like our Fig-Tree, but much pleasanter; the Fruit like our ordinary Melons, oval, smooth, and with a green Rind; the Flesh within of an Orange colour, and tasting like a sweet Orange, but more Spicy and pleasanter; the fresh Seed blackish, when dry'd turns to a Chesnut colour, and is about the thickness of <HI>Coriander</HI> Seeds, but longer; the Flesh thereof being cut through in the middle looks whitish, is tough, tastes sweet, and is like old Musk&punc;melons Seed; the Stalk of the Fruit, though green, yields like those of Figs: The Tree is full of Branches like the Fig-Tree.</P>

<P>To conclude, most agree in this, that the <HI>Papayo</HI>-Tree grows not of it self, but is Planted: What Countrey it properly belongs to is not yet certainly known, but it is by most believ'd to be a Stranger to <HI>India,</HI> and brought thither from a foreign Countrey.</P>

<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> make a Conserve of this Fruit, exceeding good against Agues and other Distempers arising from the Gaul.

<P><HI>Acosta</HI> tells us, That the Fruit being slic'd and laid to soke in Wine is counted for a dainty Banquet. It is also laid in Sugar, thereby to preserve it the longer; and sometimes open'd with a Knife is fill'd with Ginger, Garlick, and Mustard-seed, and laid to steep in Salt, Oyl, and Vinegar, or else is eaten with Rice, or Pickled like Olives: It grows in many places in <HI>India,</HI> as in <HI>Ma|labar, Goa, Surrat, Balagate, Bengale, Pegu,</HI> and others; but the best sort is judg'd to grow in <HI>Ormus,</HI> the second in <HI>Surrat,</HI> and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> in <HI>Balagate.</HI></P>
<P>A Fruit nam'd <HI>Mangan,</HI> which grows on the Isle <HI>Iava,</HI> is by the Inhabitants accounted above all Cordials in the World, whether <HI>Lapis Bezoar,</HI> or any other: It is as big as a <HI>Coco&punc;</HI>Nut, and joyns close together till grown ripe, for then it cracks and bursts asunder; within lies the Seed wrapp'd up in Wooll, which if not taken off in time, is blown away by the Wind. This Fruit is so dear, that it can scarce be purchas'd with Money. Moreover, the parts split from each other stick so fast at the bottom to the Stalk, that the strongest Man cannot pull them from it.</P>
<P>In many places in <HI>China</HI> grows also Cotton, but in greatest abundance in the Province of <HI>Nanking,</HI> especially near the City <HI>Xangchai,</HI> where there are said to dwell two hundred Cotton-Weavers, it being in that place and two neighbor|ing Villages, the onely thing whereby the Inhabitants maintain themselves. The Seed, according to their Relation, was brought out of other Countreys into <HI>China</HI> about five hundred years ago. The Herb or Plant on which the Cotton grows in <HI>China,</HI> hath a wooddy Stalk of a Foot and a half long, or two Foot high, and being cover'd with a darkish red Bark or Rind, divides it self into several short Branches: The Leaves like those of a Vine are divided into three parts, and hang on rough Stalks of two or three Inches long: The Blos|som or Flower is like those of Mallows, and ends in Saffron, or (as others say) blue and Purple Stalks; after the Flower follows round Fruit as big as a small Apple, which when grown ripe cracks in two or three places, and shews the white Cotton which is in it; under it is an Oval and white-colour'd Seed, which tastes like an Almond or Pine-Apple.</P>
<P>Another Plant also which produces Cotton, but grows like a Tree, and hath smoother Leaves, grows in <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Arabia;</HI> where by the <HI>Egyptians</HI> it is call'd <HI>Gotnel Segia,,</HI> and shoots up to the heighth of ten Cubits; the Leaves hang on Violet-colour'd Stalks, and are divided into five parts; when grown to matu|rity, the Fruit is almost of the same fashion, though bigger, with brown Seed.

<P>The County <HI>Chucheufu</HI> is full of ancient Pine-Tree Woods, of which the <HI>Chi|neses</HI> build their Houses and Ships.</P>

Of the thickest parts of these Canes they make Vessels to put Water or Merchandise into, the Wood thereof being about three Inches thick: The least of them are half a Rod high, and the biggest much higher; wherefore they are not unjustly by some call'd Trees, and particularly by <HI>Garcias</HI> compar'd to the Poplar; some are green, others quite black, and most of them Massive; the <HI>Portuguese</HI> in <HI>India</HI> call them <HI>Bambu Macho,</HI> that is, <HI>Man's Cane;</HI> though the last sort grows not in <HI>China</HI> but in <HI>India:</HI> They grow in Rocky places, shooting upright, though sometimes by Art made crooked, the better to be us'd for the making of <HI>Pala|kins:</HI> They consist from top to bottom of Knots or Joynts, about a Hand|breadth from each other; out of which shoot some straight Branches.</P>

<P>The Province of <HI>Quantung</HI> produces a Fruit, by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Yencu;</HI> by<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruit <HI>Iamboes,</HI> or <HI>Pam|pelmoes.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Portuguese, Iambos,</HI> (and the Tree <HI>Iambeiro;</HI>) by the <HI>Malabars,</HI> and those of the <HI>Canaries, Iambali;</HI> by the <HI>Indians, Tufa;</HI> by the <HI>Persians</HI> and <HI>Arabians, Tufat;</HI> by the <HI>Turks, Almat;</HI> and by the <HI>Hollanders, Pampelmoes;</HI> the Tree whereon it grows is prickly like the Lemon Tree, but somewhat bigger; the Flower or Blossom being also like that of the Lemon, is white and smells very oderi|ferously, and out of which they Distil sweet Water: The Fruit much exceeds the greatest Lemons in bigness, for it is oftentimes as big as a Mans Head: The Shell is in Colour like that of the <HI>Golden Apple;</HI> the Pulp, red and sweet, mixt with a little tartness, and tasting like a Grape which is not quite ripe; so that often times a Liquor is Press'd out of them to drink, in the manner of Cherry-Wine, Perry, or Syder; it remains good a whole Year.</P>
<P><HI>Garcias</HI> tell us, that this Fruit is in high esteem amongst the <HI>Indians,</HI> and that it was brought first thither a few years since from <HI>Malaka,</HI> where it grows in great abundance; and gives a farther Description much to the same purpose with what hath been already deliver'd.</P>
<P>There are two sorts of these Trees, very like one another; (yet their Fruits differ a little) and resemble not only in fashion and shape, but also in bigness our <HI>European</HI> Apple-Trees.</P>
<P>The Flowers and Fruits of <HI>Iambos</HI> moisten and cool, smell very sweet, and are therefore by the <HI>Indians</HI> accounted amongst the greatest Dainties; they ge|nerally use them in Physick, for being Preserv'd in Sugar, they are exceeding good against hot Distempers, because by their coolness and moistness, they quench Thirst in Feavers, and revive the Spirits.</P>
<P>In the County <HI>Chivencheufu</HI> and <HI>Changcheufu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> grow<NOTE PLACE="marg">Golden Apples.</NOTE> abundance of Golden-Apples, which in weight and bigness differ little from the <HI>European,</HI> but surpass them in Scent and Deliciousness; neither doth the Tree differ much from the <HI>European,</HI> but the Fruit differs from that which grows in other parts of <HI>China,</HI> and both Tastes and Smells exactly like a <HI>Muskadel-Grape,</HI> so that it yields not to any kind of Fruit that <HI>Europe</HI> affords: the Golden and thick Rind is easily Pill'd off; in like manner, the Meat is distinguish'd by a thin Skin, which is easily broken.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants Preserve the Fruits (after having Press'd the same between two Boards) in Sugar, and so keeping them a whole Year, both furnish their Neighbors, and send of them into foraign Countries.</P>
<P>In most parts of <HI>China,</HI> in all standing-Waters, they Sow a Seed, which with<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fruit <HI>Linkio.</HI></NOTE> small Leaves covers all the Water: The Fruit thereof call'd <HI>Linkio,</HI> grows in great abundance under the Water, and is in fashion like a three-sided Spire: The Rind which is green and thick, and red at the corners, turns black when dry'd: The Kernel thereof is very White, and tastes like a Chest-nut, but is twice or thrice as big.</P>
<P>The Lake <HI>Malo</HI> lying in the fifth County <HI>Xuntefu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Peking,</HI> is much noted for the fore-mention'd Fruit.</P>

<P>The Tree, or rather Sprout, is according to <HI>Acosta,</HI> a fine Plant, and grows eighteen or twenty handfuls high, and being as big about as a Mans Thigh, consists of many Barks, which lie close one upon another; it grows to the heighth of a Granate-Tree without Branches, for it spreads its Leaves like Canes. <HI>Boem</HI> writes, that the body thereof is thick, round, and green, not firm nor massie, but swell'd with a Watery moysture; it seems to consist of abundance of roul'd-up Leaves, which are nine handfuls long, and two and a half broad; or according to <HI>Alpinus,</HI> three or four Yards long, and about two<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vesting. in Alpin.</NOTE> broad, insomuch, that one Leaf may cover a Man all over, nay, wind round about him. The young Leaves extend in length and heighth like <HI>Indian</HI> Canes, being first roul'd up together, but when grown old, begin to open; through the middle long-ways, runs a pretty thick and long Vein, yet nevertheless, they are subject to crack and rent at the edges, if ruffl'd by the Wind; and on each side many cross Veins, which are of a sad Colour underneath, but up|wards of a pale Green; from the top of the Tree grows a Stalk with ruddy Colour'd Flowers, like a Pine-Apple, each of them is bigger than a Tulip or Lilly, but round, or rather Oval; afterwards it produces a Branch, divided into many Joynts, on each of which hang ten or fourteen Figs, so that this Bough is sometimes loaden with a hundred, or two hundred Figs: Or as <HI>Boem</HI> saith, from the middle of the Leaf shoots one single Branch with Flowers, which also grow to be Figs, to the number sometimes of above a thousand on one Bough, which one man is scarce able to carry; some of the Figs are as small as a Damsin, others as big as a great Pear, according to the Boughs on which they grow. The Fruit it self is very sweet, hath a Yellow Shell, with a soft, sweet, and well-scented Pulp, which tastes like Preserv'd Rasberries; be|ing boyl'd either in Honey or Sugar, and afterwards dry'd, it is counted good against Phlegmatick Humors. The Fruit is all the Year long to be had in the Southern Provinces of <HI>China,</HI> but in the Northern, it bears onely great Leaves, and yields no Fruit; though it requires six Moneths to ripen, yet ripe Figs may be had every Moneth, since this Tree observes no set-time, but Buds, Flowers, and is Ripe in several places all at one time. If one Bough be cut off from the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alpinus.</NOTE> Tree, or one Fig pluck'd from a Bough, the Tree will never produce either Bough or Fruit more, but withering, is cut off, and given in <HI>India</HI> for Food to the Elephants.</P>
<P>This Plant, as some say, grew first from a Sugar-Cane, Graffed on the Root of another Plant, call'd <HI>Colokasia,</HI> very common in <HI>Egypt;</HI> and indeed you may perceive the nature of both in the same, for the Leaves are as long as those of Sugar-Canes, and as broad as those of <HI>Colokasia;</HI> it is always Green, and never bare of Leaves.</P>
<P>The common Opinion is, that from the Mouth of the Flower, open'd at<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vesting.</NOTE> the right time, drops a kind of Spittle, which is suppos'd to be its Seed, since young Sprouts grow out of the Root or Foot of the Tree, before ever the Flow|er opens.</P>

<P>The Fruit (as <HI>Acosta</HI> tells us) was first brought from the Province of St. <HI>Cruis</HI> in <HI>Brasile</HI> to <HI>Peru,</HI> and from thence to the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> and lastly to <HI>China:</HI> The Plant of this Fruit grows like an Artichoke, but without prickly Points; but about the same bigness, upon the top of it are Ears which lie upon one ano|ther: As it grows to Maturity, there shoot forth from between the Leaves several colour'd Flowers, for the most part Blue, consisting of three Leaves, which at the Ripening of the Fruit fall off: The Leaves, out of which the <HI>Ana|nas</HI> grow, are twenty in number; longish, Indented about the edges, and sharp at the ends like a Sword, and are very like the Leaves of <HI>Aloe;</HI> small, Reddish,

<P>The ripe Fruit is very Juycie, and of a sweetish taste with a mixture of sowr|ness; of a deep Vermillion Colour, or (as <HI>Acosta</HI> says) Yellow, as big as a Mel|lon or Cytron, or (as <HI>Boem</HI> writes) as a Pine-Apple; the edges are of a lively Colour, good smell, nay so strong it is, that any Person walking may smell in what House they hang up in to ripen: It is generally without full of whitish knobs; the ripe Fruit is crown'd with a young Plant, which cut off, and without Root, (for it hath none put into the Ground) bears Fruit the next Year; every Plant produces onely one Fruit a Year, and that Fruit a new Plant, which when cut off and set in the Ground, the old is pull'd out, and thrown away as unfruitful; the Root is like that of an Artichoke; the Fruit slic'd and steep'd in Wine, gives it an excellent Savor and Rellish, but bites the Tongue and heats the Palate: The Juyce thereof refreshes the fainting Heart, revives the Spirits, and strengthens a squemish Stomack: Moreover, its Juyce or Wine (much more the Distill'd Water) is exceeding good against the Gravel: The Root also is a Remedy to cure the fore-mention'd Distemper: But those that are troubled with, or are careful to avoid Agues, must be sure to abstain both from the Fruit, and all that belongs to it.</P>
<P><HI>China</HI> also produces several sorts of Spices and Aromatick Plants, in the Sou|thern Province, bordering upon <HI>India,</HI> though in no great abundance, <HI>viz.</HI> Pep|per, in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Hucyao,</HI> which grows in the Province of <HI>Iunnan.</HI> Cinamon (as already we have made mention) in the Province of <HI>Quantung</HI> and <HI>Quangsi:</HI> But there is exceeding good Ginger in great abundance, which they call <HI>Sem Kiam,</HI> and store of Coco-nuts in the Southern Provinces, and especi|ally on the Isle <HI>Ainan:</HI> But because all those Plants and Fruits have been large|ly describ'd by others, it would be needless to make rehearsal thereof.</P>

<P>The Flowers of the <HI>The</HI> are of a Yellowish White, in bigness and shape like the <HI>Eglantine,</HI> but not in smell, which according to <HI>Martin,</HI> is faintyish. After the falling off of the Flowers, there remains a Cod or Husk, which is first Green, and afterwards turns Black, in it lies a round Black Seed, like those of Roses: This Seed Sown, yields a new Plant in three years time.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Martin.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Root is full of Strings, divided into several Knobs, which lie not deep in the Ground, but are just cover'd with the same, and are for no use; all the Vertue of this Plant consisting onely in the Leaves; the freshest and youngest of which are made use of in the making their Drink <HI>Cha;</HI> they gather them in the Spring, one by one, and immediately put them to warm in an Iron Kettle over the fire, then laying them a on fine light Mat, roul them together with their Hands: The Leaves thus roul'd up, are again hang'd over the fire, and then again roul'd closer together, till they are dry, and then put up carefully in Tin Vessels, thereby to keep them from all moystness; <HI>Trigaut</HI> tells us, that the <HI>Chineses</HI> dry not the Leaves over the fire, but in the Sun.</P>
<P>In the using of these Leaves is some differnece betwixt the <HI>Iapanners</HI> and <HI>Chi|neses,</HI> for they (says <HI>Trigaut</HI>) throw some of the Leaves into a Pot of boyling Water, which when the Vertue of the Leaf is sufficiently infus'd into it, they Drink hot, without eating the Leaves: The <HI>Chineses,</HI> as the Lord <HI>Tulp</HI> tells us, boyl the Leaves with a little Salt and Sugar, to take away the bitterness in a certain Liquor which they drink warm; or else they put a Handful of <HI>The</HI> Leaves in a Pint-Pot, then pour it full of scalding Water, and about two or three Minutes after, Drink the same very hot.</P>
<P><PB N="694" REF="314">The <HI>Chineses</HI> generally, both Night and Day, drink of the Liquor wherein the fore mention'd Leaves are boyl'd, and not onely ordinarily at Table, but have it ready upon all occasions at great Entertainments; and the greatest Nobles and Princes think not much to prepare it themselves, and have in their Palaces Hearths of rich Stone, principally made for that purpose, and are much look'd upon according to the richness of the Utensils they use therein.</P>
<P>The Water of the Fountain <HI>Hoei,</HI> in the County <HI>Chancheufu,</HI> of the Province of <HI>Kiangnan,</HI> is accounted the best by the <HI>Chineses</HI> to make their Drink <HI>Cha;</HI> and for that use bought by the Grandees, and from thence carry'd to the remotest Provinces, nay to the Emperor's Court at <HI>Peking.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> also drink their <HI>Cha</HI> out of peculiar Earthen Dishes, which add a curious smell to the Liquor, almost like that of Juniper, Cypress and Aloes-Wood; some of them are to be seen, being brought from thence hither.</P>
<P>The best of these Cups (according to <HI>Martinius</HI>) are made in the City <HI>Guihing,</HI> (in the Province of <HI>Kiangnang</HI>) which from whence takes its Denomination, for <HI>Guihing</HI> signifies <HI>Glory of the Earth;</HI> these are for this reason by the <HI>Chineses</HI> cho|sen before those of the Province of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> notwithstanding those are clearer and brighter, because they give a pleasant scent and taste to the Liquor, for which cause they are highly esteem'd by them; and in the whole City before nam'd, they do in a manner nothing else but make <HI>Tee</HI>-Cups, some of which they sell very dear.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> highly extol the Vertue of the Liquor <HI>Tee,</HI> and chiefly ascribe the reason that they are never troubled with the Stone nor Gout, to the same; for, say they, to drink it after Meals, takes away all indigestion and rawness of the Stomach, and causes Digestion, makes those that are inebriated sober, and restores them fresh power and Senses, removes giddiness and pains of the Head, occasion'd by excess of Drink, because it consumes the abundance of Moistures; and those that are call'd upon to vigilancy, by drinking the same expel their drowsiness, and become very vigorous and fit for Business; it pro|longs life also, fortifies the Sight, and is commended by the famous Physi|cian <HI>Nicholaus Tulp,</HI> for the wholsomest Plant that grows: And for a more particular enumeration of its Vertues, the said Physician may not unfitly be|consulted.</P>
<P>Moreover, the <HI>Chineses</HI> not onely use this Drink, but also the <HI>Indians, Tartars,</HI> those of <HI>Tibet, Mogor,</HI> and almost all the People on the Shore of the <HI>Oriental Sea;</HI> and of late years it hath been in use in divers parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> where it is pre|par'd after the same manner as amongst the <HI>Chineses,</HI> excepting that we put a little Sugar-Candy into it, to abate the bitterness of it, as it appears to our Palates.</P>
<P>It is doubted whether this Plant and the use thereof were known to the <HI>Chi|neses</HI> in former Ages: <HI>Trigaut</HI> tells us that they have not us'd it long, because in the old <HI>Chinese</HI> Books not one Character or Letter is found that expresses the same. Others affirm, that this Plant or Herb grew many Ages ago wild, and without Planting, but that the Setting or Sowing of it, its Vertue and manner of making Liquor thereof was known but of late to the <HI>Chineses.</HI> The Herb at this day grows not wild, but is planted with great care on Hills, and Set about three Foot distant one Plant from another. It grows in no other place but <HI>China, Siam, Iapan</HI> aud <HI>Tunking;</HI> but in no part of <HI>China</HI> in greater abundance than in the thirteenth County <HI>Chicheufu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Nanking.</HI></P>

Moreover, the Musk which they take from this Beast is of divers Prices: After they have taken it they draw all the Blood from it, and keep it apart from his Navel; they also cut a Bag which is full of Blood, or sweet-scented Moisture; then they flay and cut it in many pieces. When they will make the best Musk of it, they take one half of the Beast, the hind part from the Kidneys, which with a little Blood they stamp in a great Stone-Mortar till they have made it a Pap, with which after it is dry'd they fill little Bags made of the Deers Skin. There is a worse sort, made of the fore-part of the Beast as far as the Kidneys; but the worst of all is made of the whole Beast toge|ther: And this last is the Musk us'd in these Countreys of <HI>Europe.</HI> Thus far <HI>Marinus.</HI></Q></P>
<P>When this Beast, as the <HI>Chineses</HI> write, is carry'd out of the Kingdom of <HI>Lu</HI> into that of <HI>Laos,</HI> it dies instantly, like a Fish which is taken out of the Water.</P>

<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> also use Ducks to Weed their Rice.</P>
<P>In most parts of <HI>China</HI> is found a Bird in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Louwa,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Bird <HI>Louwa.</HI></NOTE> which is smaller than a Goose, and not unlike a Raven, with a long Bill and Neck like a Crane, at the end crooked, with Feet like a Swan, and a very wide Maw, excellent for Fishing.</P>
<P>This Bird seems to be the same with that which <HI>Pliny</HI> calls by the <HI>Greek</HI> Name <GAP DESC="foreign">, which signifies <HI>Asse's Cymbal,</HI> because of its strange noise, and is by him describ'd in the following words:</P>
<P><Q>The <GAP DESC="foreign"> (saith he) differs not much in shape from a Swan, except in the Throat, in which, being of an extraordinary bigness, this unreasona|ble Creature stores all that it gets: After it hath gotten its fill, the gorged Store comes up again into the Mouth, and from thence being chew'd, goes into the Belly.</Q> Thus far <HI>Pliny.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> fish with these Birds, teaching them to catch Fish as here we teach our Dogs to Hunt: Their Fishing is in this manner:</P>
<P>The Fisher-man goes with little Boats, or Floats of Canes joyn'd close toge|ther, puts out into some River or Lake with the foremention'd Birds; which being let out, immediately dive under Water, and shoot down with great swift|ness. So soon as any of these Birds have overtaken a Fish in the Water, he swallows him up into his Maw, and immediately rising again comes to the
<PB N="699" REF="316">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
side of the Boat, where the Fisher-man forces open his Bill, and pulls the Fish out of his Maw with great dexterity; then puts the Bird over-board again, to catch more Fish after the same manner.</P>
<P>But to prevent these Birds from swallowing the Fish, which they are very greedy of; they lock their Throats, by putting on an Iron Ring about them, beyond which the Fish cannot pass.</P>
<P>Those Fish which by reason of their bigness cannot be swallow'd, they bring up in their Bills, giving timely notice to the Fisher-man, by a noise which they make, that so he may be ready to take the Fish from them; nay some|times one Bird helps another (if the Fish be very big) to bring him to the Boat, each holding a part thereof in his Bill.</P>
<P>If any Bird, after his being put over-board, Dive not instantly under Wa|ter, it is cruelly beaten with a Cane, till the Feathers flie off, thereby to break it of its slothfulness.</P>
<P>After they have taken a considerable number of Fish, the Iron Ring is taken off from them, that then they may Fish for themselves, which makes them an|other time the willinger to Fish for their Masters.</P>
<P>The Fisher-men pay yearly for every Fish a certain Tribute to the Emperor.</P>
<P>The Birds before-mention'd are very dear, one of them (which is any thing dextrous in fishing) being sold for fifty <HI>Tail</HI> of Silver, every <HI>Tail</HI> being an <HI>English</HI> Crown.</P>
<P><HI>Iohn Gonzalves</HI> of <HI>Mendoza,</HI> in his Description of the Empire of <HI>China,</HI> calls these Fishing-birds <HI>Sholfers,</HI> and gives an account of their Fishing, much to the same purpose as hath been already describ'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> (says he) have a peculiar way of Fishing, which is very plea|sant and good. The Emperor keeps in every Town built near Rivers certain Houses, in which every year young <HI>Sholfers</HI> are bred up, with which they Fish in certain seasons, after this manner:</P>
<P>The Masters of the Fowls take them out of their Coops, and carry them
<PB N="700" REF="317">
down to the Shore, where they keep many Boats to Fish with, and fill them half way full of Water, then they tie their Crop with a String under their Wings so close that they cannot swallow the Fish; then they throw them into the Water to Fish, which they do with great eagerness, and Dive with great dexterity and swiftness under the Water; after having been a while out of sight, they appear again with their Bill and Throat full of Fish, and come fly|ing towards the Boat, and evacuate the Fish in the Water which is in the Boat, that so they may be kept alive.</P>
<P>In the County <HI>Nanningfu,</HI> of the Province of <HI>Quangsi,</HI> are a kind of small Par|rets, in bigness and shape like Mag-Pies.</P>
<P>On the craggy Mountains of <HI>Suchuen</HI> are very large Mag-Pies, and in the same County, near the Garrison'd City <HI>Ydmui</HI> great store of Larks.</P>
<P>In the Provinces of <HI>Quantung, Quangsi,</HI> and <HI>Iunnan,</HI> are both tame and wild Peacocks; they are in no other Provinces, unless brought from thence.</P>
<P>In the County <HI>Hoaiganfu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Nanking,</HI> are more Quails and Pheasants than in any other part of <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>In the County <HI>Taipingfu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Nanking,</HI> lies an Island nam'd <HI>Hoa,</HI> in the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> which seems to be nothing but a hollow Rock, in which are an incredible number of Owls; from whence the Island hath gotten its Denomination.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Xantung</HI> are great store of Poultrey, Pheasants and Wood-Cocks, insomuch that they are bought there extraordinary cheap.</P>
<P>Very remarkable is a Bird properly call'd <HI>Fung,</HI> and by addition of the word <HI>Ciang,</HI> is nam'd <HI>Fungciang,</HI> in regard the appearance of the Bird (which is very seldom and always alone) is by the <HI>Chineses</HI> look'd upon as a good Omen, and ve|ry fortunate to the whole Empire. <HI>Boem</HI> also writes, that if this Bird disappears suddenly from the sight of Men, it is a sign of one or other sad event, or threat|ning danger to those of the Royal Blood. The <HI>Chineses</HI> have this Bird in great veneration, so that the Figure of it is frequently seen among them, both in their Paintings, Tapestry, Weavings, and their Imbroyderies of Gold, Silver and Silk, and the greatest of the Nobility have the Effigies of it often wrought on their Clothes. <HI>Martinius</HI> will have him to be the Phenix, or else an unknown sort of Crane, resembling a Peacock in head, and variety of Colours; it is said to breed in the Mountain of the Kingdom of <HI>Tang.</HI></P>
<P>The same <HI>Martinius</HI> tells us, that in the County <HI>Munghoafu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Iunnan,</HI> is a Mountain, from the <HI>Chinese</HI> Phenix call'd <HI>Funghoang;</HI> because this Bird (as they say) dy'd on the same, after he had sung a while very melodiously. They also add, that all the Birds about the latter end of Harvest meet on the same, and there bewail the death of their Phenix: The Inhabitants observe al|so that time, and climb up the Hill in the Night with Lights to catch Birds, and return from thence loaden with their purchase.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Xensi</HI> are Bats as big as Hens or Geese; they are by the <HI>Chineses</HI> accounted great Dainties, who prefer their flesh before that of Poultry.

thereof, call'd them <HI>Flying Apes;</HI> yet they may well be reckon'd amongst the other sort of Bats, having their Wings Skinny and not Feather'd, and because they have Ears and Claws, and lay no Eggs, but suckle their Young: they are as big as a Cat, with a thick Hairy Breast and Belly, and likewise are cover'd all over from their Neck to the Claws with a Skin like a Sprit-Sail; they seem to differ from all other Bats, besides that, this Skin like a Sail is fleshy underneath, but on the top cover'd with soft Hair like a Conies, of an Ash-colour: Moreover, their Wings are not as those of other Bats, drawn together, and spread out again with folds; therefore we shall find, if these and the Bats of <HI>Brasile,</HI> or any other in <HI>India</HI> be compar'd together, that there is a great difference betwixt them. The whole Creature is about three Foot long, and of a proportionable breadth; hath a thin Tail of a Span long, which seems to be fasten'd to the fore-mention'd Skin, which covers the whole Body from Head to Foot, like a Sprit-Sail; the Legs are also cover'd with a soft yellow Wool; the Feet are arm'd with sharp Claws, with which it holds all things that it seizes on, especially Fruit; it hath a long Head of an ugly aspect and wide Mouth, little Teeth, and round short Ears, consisting of a thin Skin. <HI>Kircher</HI> tells us, that those Bats have not Quilly, but Sinnewie Wings, with which they flie in the Air like ordinary Bats; yet, that their Nervous Wings are so well distinguish'd in length, that they show as if they were Feather'd. They breed in thick Woods, and hang by their Claws on the hollow Bodies and Boughs of Trees, or on the Roofs of Huts, appearing with their Sail-like Skins, rather like Sachels than Animls, by which means they escape the fury of other Creatures their Enemies: They annoy the Cattel exceedingly by sucking their Blood and Milk, which is their best Food.</P>
<P>Moreover, (according to <HI>Bontius</HI>) on the Island <HI>Iava,</HI> breed ordinary Bats in the Woods, which are as big as Pigeons, which the <HI>Iavans</HI> eat for a great Dain|ty: They often come into the Houses at Night, if the Windows or Doors chance to be left open in the Day, and fastning themselves like Leeches to the

Feet of those whom they find asleep, suck great abundance of Blood from them, which more amazes than hurts them when they awake.</P>

<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> ridiculously believe, and some have written to that effect: If any one besmears his Feet with the Blood of this Fish, he may walk on the Water as well as on the Land.

<P>The County of <HI>Ningpofu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> lying near the Sea, is well provided with Sea-Fish, which they dry in the Sun, as Oysters, Crabs, and Lobsters, with which they furnish most parts of <HI>China.</HI></P>

<P>In the County <HI>Nanyangfu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Honan,</HI> are Serpents, whose Skin is generally full of white Spots. The Wine in which they have been steep'd, is an excellent Remedy against Stiffness of the Joynts or Limbs.</P>
<P>In the County <HI>Hoangcheufu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Huquang,</HI> are Serpents which heal the Leprosie and Scabbiness.</P>
<P>On the Mountain <HI>Citien,</HI> by the City <HI>Caihoa</HI> in the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> are very great Serpents, which have no manner of Poyson.</P>

<P>In the Province of <HI>Quangsi,</HI> and in many other places in <HI>India,</HI> is a sort of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Serpent <HI>Cabros de Cabello.</HI></NOTE> Serpents, by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call'd <HI>Cabros de Cabello,</HI> that is, <HI>Serpents of Hair,</HI> or <HI>Hairy Serpents;</HI> in the Heads whereof a Stone is found, by the <HI>Portuguese</HI> nam'd <HI>Piedro del Cobra,</HI> or <HI>Serpent-Stone,</HI> good against Wounds or the Bitings of the same Serpent, which otherwise would destroy in twenty four Hours: It is round, and of a blue colour, in the middle pierc'd with white; being laid to the Wound it sticks fast thereon of it self, but when impregnated with the Poy|son, it falls from it, then thrown a while into Milk, it returns to its natural Quality; if it sticks the second time to the Wound, it is a certain sign that all the Poyson is not drawn out, but if it falls off, then the Patient is certainly past danger.</P>
<P>This Stone hath been experienc'd with good success upon divers, both Men and Beasts, according to the testimony of <HI>Kircher</HI> and several others.</P>
<P>There is also a Root good against the Bitings of these Serpents, which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> call <HI>Rais de Cabro,</HI> that is, <HI>Serpent-Root,</HI> which being chew'd so long till the Patient Sneezes two or three times, cures him.</P>
<P>This Vertue is not onely in the natural, but also the artificial Stone made of some of the pieces of the natural Stone, or of the Head, Liver, Teeth, and Heart of the Serpent, mix'd with <HI>Terra Sigillata,</HI> or <HI>Seal'd Earth.</HI> The <HI>Brach|mans,</HI> though proffer'd never so great a Sum of Money, will not teach this Art to any.</P>
<P>Moreover, there is another very venomous Serpent amongst the <HI>Chineses,</HI> which by biting kills a Man in few Hours; out of which also they draw a Me|dicine, good against several Sicknesses, after this manner: The Tail and Body is put into a Kettle of the best Wine, leaving onely the Head, which is put through a Hole made in the Lid thereof; out of which the Serpent at the boyl|ing of the Wine, which is hung over a great Fire, breathes forth all the Poyson through its gaping Mouth. The Flesh, the Head being cut off, is given to the Sick, and preserv'd, being (as they say) the onely precious thing to expel Poy|son, like Treacle, or other soveraign Medicines.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Xensi</HI> is exceedingly infested with Locusts, which devour all the Product of the Fields, insomuch that at some times there is not one Blade of Grass to be seen, notwithstanding the Inhabitants, both great and small, at Command of their Magistrates, kill and destroy them in the Fields.

Of the Combs the <HI>Chineses</HI> make Candles, as we of our Wax, but they are much whiter, and being very dear, are onely us'd by Persons of Quality; for besides their whiteness they give an excellent scent when lighted; neither do they spot the Clothes they drop upon, and burn also very clear and bright.</P>

<P>No place in <HI>China</HI> feeds more Silk-Worms than the Province of <HI>Chekiang;</HI> for it not onely furnishes its own Inhabitants, and all <HI>China</HI> with Silk-Stuffs of divers sorts, but also the neighboring Countrey <HI>Iapan,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> on the <HI>Phi|lippine</HI> Isles, nay, <HI>India</HI> and the remotest Countreys in <HI>Europe;</HI> for the <HI>Hollanders</HI> buy great store of Silk at <HI>Hocksieu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> which is all brought thither out of the Province of <HI>Chekiang.</HI></P>
<P>The Silk-Stuffs made in this Province are accounted the best in all <HI>China,</HI> and are to be had at so cheap a Rate, that ten Men may go clad in Silk at less Charge than one Man in Cloth in <HI>Europe.</HI> They Prune their Mulberry-Trees once a year, as we do our Vines, and suffer them not to grow up to high Trees, because through long experience they have learn'd, that the Leaves of the smallest and youngest Trees make the best Silk, and know thereby how to distinguish the first Spinning of the Threds from the second, <HI>viz.</HI> the first is that which comes from the young Leaves that are gather'd in <HI>March,</HI> with which they feed their Silk-Worms; and the second is of the ould Summer Leaves, and it is onely the change of Food, as the young and old Leaves, which makes the difference in the Silk. This is perhaps the reason why the Silk which is made in <HI>Europe</HI> is courser than that made by the <HI>Chineses.</HI> The Prices of the first and second Spinning also differs amongst the <HI>Chineses,</HI> whenas most Silk-Throsters in <HI>Europe</HI> make no difference therein. The best Silk is Spun in <HI>March,</HI> the coursest in <HI>Iune,</HI> yet both in one year. The breeding of the Worms is all one, and requires as much trouble and care as in some places in <HI>Europe;</HI> therefore it is plainly false, and a <HI>Romance,</HI> That all the Silk in <HI>China</HI> is produc'd by the Silk-Worms on the Trees without care or labour.</P>
<P><HI>Martinius</HI> tells us, That the breeding of Silk-Worms, and making of Cotton and Silk, is an ancient Invention of the <HI>Chineses;</HI> for the Wife of the Emperor <HI>Ya,</HI> who Reign'd <HI>Anno</HI> 2357. before the Navity of <HI>Christ,</HI> is said to have been the

first Inventress and Teacher thereof to her Subjects: for though the breeding of Silk-Worms was not unknown to the <HI>Chineses</HI> at that time, yet they were ignorant in the Art of making Clothes of the same, as it generally happens in the beginning of all things. To the <HI>Chineses</HI> justly belongs the honour, that from them originally the Art of making Silk was translated to other Coun|treys of <HI>Asia</HI> and <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Xantung</HI> the Silk Threds are Spun on Trees and in the Fields, not by tame Silk-Worms, but another kind of Worm like a Caterpiller which Spin not their Silk in manner of a Ball or Egg, but in long Threds of a white colour, which are blown to and again by the Wind on Trees and Hou|ses, from whence the Inhabitants fetch them; almost after the same manner as our long Spider-Threds in Cobwebs, which flye up and down in Summer. Of this Silk they also make Silk-Stuffs as well as of that Spun by Silk-Worms, and much stronger, though somewhat courser.</P>

<P>In the County <HI>Chaocheufu</HI> in the same Province, are many Crocodiles in the River <HI>Zo,</HI> which oftentimes hurt the neighboring People.</P>
<P>On the East side of the chief City <HI>Gucheu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Quangsi,</HI> is a lit|tle Lake nam'd <HI>Go,</HI> in which King <HI>Pegao</HI> in ancient times kept ten Crocodiles, to which he threw Malefactors to be devour'd by them; those which were guiltless or innocent, being (as the <HI>Chineses</HI> say) found untouch'd, were taken out again and releas'd.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Huquang,</HI> in the River <HI>Siang,</HI> is a Beast which chiefly re|sembles a Horse, but with Scales on its Body, and Claws like a Tyger: It is of a cruel Nature, and seizes on Man and Beast, especially in Harvest, for then it often comes out of the Water, and runs all over the Countrey.</P>
<P>In the River <HI>Iun,</HI> in the same County <HI>Chaokingfu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> breeds a Fish, by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>The Swimming Cow,</HI> because it often comes out of the Water and engages with its Horns the tame Cow; but if it stays long out of the Water its Horns turn yellow, and lose their hardness, by which means it is forc'd to return to the Water, where it becomes a Fish again, and the Horns obtain their former hardness.</P>
<P>In the County <HI>Changtefu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Honan,</HI> breeds a Fish in the Ri|vers, by the <HI>Chineses</HI> nam'd <HI>Hagul,</HI> that is, <HI>Child,</HI> because when caught it cries like a Child. In shape this Fish differs little from a Crocodile, hath a long Tail, and goes on four Feet: The Fat thereof once set on fire, cannot be quench'd either by Water, or any other means.</P>
<P>In <HI>China</HI> also are many Land and Sea-Tortoises, or Turtles, call'd <HI>Quei,</HI> espe|cially in the County <HI>Chunkingfu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Suchuen,</HI> and in the Island <HI>Pequei,</HI> that is, <HI>Isle of Turtles,</HI> lying in the River <HI>Kiang,</HI> and the Province of <HI>Huquang;</HI> some of them are very big, and others small and handsom, which the Inhabitants keep in their Houses; some are no bigger than a small Bird.</P>
<P><PB N="707" REF="320">The <HI>Chineses</HI> relate of a strange accident that happen'd there to a Soldier, who being accidentally by his Enemies thrown into the River, was by a Tor|toise (which it is likely he had formerly fed and set at liberty) carry'd like an <HI>Arion</HI> on a Dolphins back to the opposite Shore.</P>
<P>In the fourth County <HI>Hoeicheufu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Quantung,</HI> are seen at Sea, Turtles of such a vast bigness, that afar off they seem to be Rocks, some having Shrubs and other Plants growing on their Shells.</P>
<P>In some Provinces of <HI>China,</HI> and especially in <HI>Honan</HI> are flying Turtles, with green, and others with blue Wings on their Feet, by the spreading out of which they push themselves forward, leaping after the manner of Grashoppers: The Feet of these Turtles, are for the Rarity thereof, in great esteem among the <HI>Chineses;</HI> those that have green Wing'd Feet are call'd <HI>Lo Mae Quey, Quey</HI> sig|nifying <HI>A Tortoise; Lo, Green;</HI> and <HI>Mae, Wings.</HI></P>
<P>In all places near the Sea are plenty of Oysters, almost as good as our <HI>Colchester</HI>-Oysters, especially in the County <HI>Tencheufu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Xan|tung.</HI></P>
<P>In the eleventh County <HI>Vencheufu,</HI> of the Province of <HI>Chikiang,</HI> are small Oy|sters, of which it is reported, that from the Powder of them, dry'd and stamp'd, and Sown like Seed along the Fields in Marsh Ground, there grow Oysters of a very sweet Rellish; most of the Sea-bordering places abound also with Crabs and Lobsters.</P>

<HEAD>Minerals, Stones, and Earths.</HEAD>
<P>THrough all <HI>China</HI> are an innumerable company of Mines, which abound in all sorts of Mettal, and in particular Gold and Silver in great store, though there be an Edict in <HI>China</HI> not to Dig for them; because (as the <HI>Chineses</HI> say) Men are generally kill'd in the Mines, by the dangerous Damps and Vapours that arise from the Earth: But to gather Gold on the Shores of Rivers is free for every Man, after which manner they get great store; and Gold is rather a Commodity or Merchandize it self amongst the <HI>Chineses,</HI> than a Purchaser of other Commodities.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Iunnan</HI> they gather great quantities of Gold out of the cleans'd Sand; but if the Mines might be open'd, the <HI>Chineses</HI> could not expect greater abundance of Gold or Silver from any other place: from whence there is a Proverb amongst them, wherein those that are seen to spend their Estates in Riot and Prodigality, are ask'd, <HI>Whither their Fathers be Receivers of the Empe|rors Revenue in the Province of</HI> Junnan? There are also in this Province Mines of Tin, Iron, and Lead.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Fokien</HI> hath Copper, Tin, and Iron Mines, and in some places Gold and Siver Mines also: Particularly in the sixth County <HI>Tingcheufu,</HI> in the same Province, the Mountain <HI>Kin,</HI> that is, <HI>Gold,</HI> is so call'd from its Gol|den Mines which were open'd by the Family <HI>Sung.</HI></P>
<P>The Mountains in the Province of <HI>Queicheu,</HI> inclose (as the <HI>Chineses</HI> write) Gold, Silver, Quicksilver, and the like rich Mettals, all which might easily be gotten, if the Mountaineers, or Inhabitants of the Mountains could be sub|du'd and brought to Obedience; but now the <HI>Chineses</HI> have no more benefit than the fore-mention'd People will give them out of their free Wills in Barter for Salt, or any other Necessaries.</P>

There is also very good Marble in the County <HI>Iunnanfu:</HI> Out of the Mountains near the Garrison'd City <HI>Siven,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Peking,</HI> they Dig white and red Marble or Porphyre-stones, and also exceeding good Crystal, which is also found on the Mountain <HI>Ting,</HI> in the County <HI>Quanglingfu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Quangsi:</HI> In the same Province are Agats, for their colour and hardness highly esteem'd.</P>
<P>By the little City <HI>Queiyang,</HI> in the County <HI>Hengchufu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Hu|quang,</HI> on the Mountain <HI>Xeyen,</HI> are Stones found after Rainy Weather exactly re|sembling Swallows; which we have already mention'd among the Mountains.</P>
<P>On the Mountain <HI>Queiyu,</HI> in the County <HI>Taicheufu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> all the Stones, as well great as small, grow naturally square.</P>
<P>In the County <HI>Cunchangfu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> they gather little blue Stones with white Veins or Streaks, which are highly esteem'd by Persons of Quality; for the common Opinion is, that being burnt to Chalk and pounded very small, they are good to prolong Life.</P>
<P>On the Mountain <HI>Pao,</HI> in the fifth County <HI>Hoangcheufu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Huquang</HI> they find Stones, of which, some if laid in the Sun, turn Red, others Yellow, and retain that Colour for a considerable time.</P>
<P>Out of the almost inaccessible Mountain <HI>Io,</HI> by the City <HI>Pa,</HI> in the County <HI>Paoningfu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Suchuen,</HI> they Dig Precious Stones.</P>

<P>Out of the Mountain <HI>Tape,</HI> by the City <HI>Lungkieu,</HI> in the County <HI>Taitungfu,</HI> of the Province of <HI>Xansi,</HI> they Dig Earth so Red, that it is us'd in stead of Ver|million to Print the Red <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters with.</P>
<P>Out of the Mountain <HI>Nieuxeu,</HI> in the County <HI>Siganfu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> is Digg'd a certain White Earth, which is us'd by the Women in stead of White Lead, to make them Beautiful, by taking away all Spots and Freckles

<P>The Mountain <HI>Io,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> produces a certain Blue Earth or Mineral, with which they make a kind of Starch for their Linnen.</P>
<P>Through all the Province of <HI>Xansi,</HI> they Dig a sort of Coal, firm and slick like Jet or black Marble, such as those of <HI>Luker-land,</HI> or like our Cannel-Coal in <HI>Derby-shire:</HI> The <HI>Chineses,</HI> especially the Common people, burn these Coals (call'd <HI>Mui</HI>) on their Hearths, in their Kitchins or Chambers, but first break them very small, (they being Digg'd in great Pieces) and then mixt with Water, make them into Balls; they are a long while a kindling, but once light|ed, they cast a great heat, and keep in a great while: The Northern <HI>Chineses</HI> burn also Wood, Cane, and other Fuel.</P>
<P>In the same Province are wonderful Fire-pits, like our Water-pits; they are in most places, and serve in stead of other Fires, for the poor people to boyl their Meat over; which they do after this manner, the Mouth of the Pit is shut very close, except a little hole just big enough for the Pot to stand in; and so the Inhabitants Boyl their Meat without trouble: They say that this Fire burns dull and not bright, and though it be very hot, yet sets not the least Stick of Wood a fire, if thrown into the same; nay that which is more, it may by being put into a great hollow Cane, be carry'd from one place to the other, so that every man may use it when he pleaseth; and by opening the Mouth of the Cane, out of which the heat strikes, Boyl a Pot with Meat, yet never hurt the Cane in which the Fire is Inclos'd.</P>
<P>Out of the Mountains <HI>Kie</HI> and <HI>Siuvu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Peking,</HI> by the City <HI>Pingeo,</HI> they Dig another sort of Coal, which they burn for ordinary Fuel.</P>

<P>In the County <HI>Kincheufu,</HI> of the Province of <HI>Huquang,</HI> and in the County <HI>Quei|lingfu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Quangsi,</HI> are very excellent Stones found, with which the <HI>Chineses</HI> temper their Ink, as the <HI>European</HI> Painters their Colours.</P>
<P>In the County <HI>Nanhingfu</HI> is a black Stone, very like the <HI>Chinese</HI> Ink, with which they write on Boards, as we do with Chalk: There is also a Stone which is so hard, that the Inhabitants make Stone Axes and Knives thereof.</P>
<P>Out of the Mountain <HI>Tiexe,</HI> lying in the Province of <HI>Suchuen,</HI> by the Garri|son'd City <HI>Kienchang</HI> they Dig Stones, which melted in the fire produce Iron, very good to make Swords and Faulchions of.</P>

<P>In several places in <HI>China,</HI> especially in the fourth County <HI>Nieucheufu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> is a kind of Gum, in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Cie,</HI> which drops out of the Trees, and is very like Gum or Oyl of Turpentine: The <HI>Chi|neses</HI> gather it in the Summer, and cleansing the same, Colour it how they please; the best is yellow like Gold, and the next black; before it is dry'd it yields a malignant Damp, which makes the Faces of those which are not us'd to it, swell and look pale for a time, but they soon recover again: It dries ve|ry leasurely when any Chests or Cabinets are Varnish'd with the same, but when once dry, it never melts again: What a curious and shining thing this Gum is, <HI>Europe</HI> hath long since seen by the Cabinets and Chests that are brought hither from <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Iapan:</HI> The <HI>Chineses</HI> varnish all their curious Wood-Work with the same; as also their Ships, Houses, Tables, Bed-steads, Closets, and
<PB N="710" REF="322">
all their Houshold Utensils, to the great lustre thereof. <HI>Trigaut</HI> gives us this following Account of this Gum, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>In <HI>China</HI> is a certain Gum like Musk, press'd out of the Bark of a Tree, and thick like Pitch, of which the <HI>Chineses</HI> make a Varnish, by them call'd <HI>Cie,</HI> and by the <HI>Portuguese, Ciaro.</HI> With this <HI>Cie</HI> they Varnish their Tables, Presses, and other Housholdstuff, as also their Ships and Houses, and Colour it how they please: The Work thus Varnish'd shines like Glass, and is very beautiful to the Eye, and acceptable by reason of its smoothness, and conti|nues many years. By means of this Gum the Houses of the <HI>Chineses</HI> and <HI>Ia|panners</HI> shine in such a manner, that they dazle the Eyes of the Beholders. With this also they represent the colour of all kind of Wood. And for this reason the <HI>Chineses,</HI> by whom this Gum is us'd, account Table-clothes alto|gether superfluous; for if the shining and Crystal-like Tables acciden|tally, by spilling of any Grease upon them, are bereav'd of their lustre, they are restor'd to their former beauty, by being wash'd over with warm Water, because nothing can soak through the hard Gum. Besides this Gum there is an Oyl, press'd out of the Fruit of another Tree, not unlike the former; the use thereof is also one and the same, but gives not so great a Gloss.</Q></P>
<P>We have several kinds of Varnish amongst us, in imitation of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> but far short of it, the true Preparation thereof being doubtless unknown to us, or but imperfectly discover'd.</P>
<P>Out of the Mountains in the eighth County <HI>Ienganfu</HI> in the Province of<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Peters</HI>-Oyl.</NOTE> <HI>Xensi,</HI> is digg'd a slimy Moisture, generally call'd <HI>Peters-Oyl,</HI> which the <HI>Chineses</HI> use in their Lamps, and against Scabs.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Suchuen</HI> is abundance of yellow Amber, which is gather'd on the Coast of <HI>Pomeren,</HI> and in other parts of the same Province another sort of a reddish colour.</P>
<P><HI>Martinius</HI> speaks of great quantities of artificial Amber, made of the boyl'd Gum of Pine-Trees, and sold by the <HI>Chineses;</HI> so exactly imitated, that it was not to be distinguish'd from the best; neither is it a certain sign of true Am|ber, to attract Chaff or other light things; for the falsifi'd and artificial, if rubb'd, hath an attracting power as well as the natural.</P>
<P>In the Provinces of <HI>Iunnan</HI> they also have Amber which is somewhat redder than the <HI>Pomeran;</HI> for yellow they have none.</P>
<P>The Salt which the <HI>Chineses</HI> have, is not onely made in the Sea-bordering Provinces, but there are also Inland Waters of which they make Salt without any great trouble.</P>
<P>In the County <HI>Hokienfu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Peking,</HI> are large Fields, which extending to the Sea-side, are wash'd by the Sea Water, which leaves great quantities of Salt upon the Banks.</P>
<P>All the Water of the Lake <HI>Ieu,</HI> lying in the County <HI>Pingyangfu</HI> in the Pro|vince of <HI>Xansi,</HI> is as salt as Sea-Water, and Salt also made of it by the Inha|bitants.</P>
<P>In the County <HI>Kingyangfu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> are two Pools of salt Water, of which they make abundance of Salt.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Iunnan,</HI> on the North-East side of the City <HI>Yaogan,</HI> is a great Pit of salt Water, out of which is extracted exceeding white Salt, with which the whole County <HI>Yaoganfu</HI> is furnish'd. The Pit is call'd <HI>Peyencing,</HI> that is, <HI>Pit of white Salt.</HI> The first finding of this Salt is ascrib'd to the Sheep, be|cause they us'd to lick the Earth thereabouts, and scratch up lumps of Salt
<PB N="711" REF="322">
with their Feet, till the Inhabitants at last observing the same, found salt Wa|ter and Earth there.</P>
<P><HI>China</HI> abounds with Salt in all places; so that besides the great plenty for common use, the Salt-Trade brings great Revenue into the Emperor's Trea|sury, there being an incredible number of People which Trade in that Com|modity.</P>
<P>Every Province in which Salt is made, pays yearly a certain weight of Salt to the Emperor for Tribute.</P>
<P>On the Mountains in the Province of <HI>Suchuen</HI> are Salt-pits, which supply all the Inhabitants of that Province with Salt; which is a great testimony of God's Providence to these People, considering this part of <HI>China</HI> lies remote from the Sea, and could not be furnish'd with Salt from any other places, but with exceeding great trouble.</P>
<P>These Pits are some of them a hundred Paces deep, as being on inhabited Hills of salt Earth: The Mouth of one of them is not above three or four Hands|breadth wide: They are search'd with an Iron Instrument in form of a Hand, which being let down in the Ground, by reason of its great weight and sharp Fingers, presses through the same, then drawn up again shuts close, and brings up a handful of Earth; which they do so long till they come to salt Earth and Water, which is afterwards pull'd out with a Tub or Bucket, which hath a Co|ver at the top, and a Hole in the bottom, through which the Water running as the Vessel goes down thrusts it open, but when it is full and pull'd up by a Rope it falls and shuts again: which salt Water being taken out and set over the Fire, its watry part evaporates forth&punc; and leaves white Salt in the bottom; yet is not altogether so salt as that which is made of Sea-Water.</P>
<P>There are Salt-pits also in the County <HI>Queicheufu.</HI> And likewise in the Ter|ritory <HI>Kiahingfu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> are very great Salt-pits, in the Fields near the Sea, where they make abundance of Salt. Also in the County <HI>Hoaiganfu,</HI> not far from the City <HI>Hoaigain,</HI> and in several other places bordering on the Sea.</P>
<P>In <HI>China</HI> onely is that kind of fine Earth of which is made that rich Mate|rial of those we call <HI>China-Dishes,</HI> and this Stuff is call'd <HI>Porcelane.</HI> Some falsly affirm, That the Matter of which the <HI>Porcelane</HI> is made is prepar'd of pounded Egg-shells, or Sea-Cockles, adding, That it must lie a hundred years under Ground before it can be us'd. Others tell us, That the right <HI>Porcelane</HI> is made of a hard chalky Earth, which is first beaten to Powder, and ground to Meal, and then is thrown into Troughs made of gray Stone full of Water, and there left to soak so long till it becomes a Pap; mean while a thin Skin comes over it, of some of which they make <HI>Porcelane,</HI> as fine and clear as Crystal, which on pain of Death may not be carry'd out of the Countrey, but must all be brought to the Court, and deliver'd to the Emperor and his Council: The next sort is made of the uppermost Stuff under this Skin; and this is the finest <HI>Porcelane</HI> we have in <HI>Europe:</HI> and so the nearer this Mucilage is to the bottom of the Troughs, still so much the courser is the <HI>Porcelane</HI> made thereof, the bottom of all being not much better than our Earthen Ware. But <HI>Martinius, Trigaut,</HI> and other <HI>Iesuits,</HI> who were Eye-witnesses, write with more probability, That the Stuff of which they make their <HI>Porcelane,</HI> is a dry Earth, like Chalk and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> Sand, and (according to <HI>Trigaut</HI>) yellow.</P>
<P>This Earth is digg'd in the fourteenth County <HI>Hoeicheufu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Nanking,</HI> and from thence carry'd in square Lumps or Cakes, each weighing
<PB N="712" REF="323">
about three <HI>Catties,</HI> to the Province of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> along the River <HI>Po.</HI> And in this Province, at a Village call'd <HI>Sinktesinu,</HI> near the City <HI>Feuleang,</HI> in the fourth County <HI>Iaocheufu,</HI> the best <HI>Porcelane</HI> in all <HI>China</HI> is made: for though there be Earth in other places, of which the <HI>Porcelane</HI> might be made, yet it is no way to be compar'd to that which is made in the Village.</P>
<P>It is to be observ'd, that <HI>Porcelane</HI> cannot be made in the fore-mention'd place, where there is such an abundance of Earth, either for want of Water, or because the Water is not so proper for the making of it.</P>
<P>Those which dig the Earth carry it not themselves to the Province of <HI>Ki|angsi,</HI> but generally sell Cakes or Lumps thereof to other People, who main|tain themselves by carrying of them thither; yet not one Lump may be car|ry'd away before it is mark'd with the Emperor's Arms, thereby to prevent the falsifying of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Porcelane</HI> Vessels are made after the same manner as our Potters make their Earthen Ware. The Vessels, Plates or Dishes, as soon as form'd, are Painted with various Colours, as yellow, red, blue, or any other. That which is of a Saffron colour, and Painted with Shapes of Dragons, is sent to the Empe|ror and his Council; and the red, yellow, and blue, is sold amongst the com|mon People.</P>
<P>To colour the <HI>Porcelane</HI> blue they generall use a certain Weed, which in the Southern Provinces is found in great abundance.</P>
<P>The Baking of these Vessels is after this manner: Being shap'd, and having stood a while in the Wind and Sun to dry, they are put into an Oven, which is for fifteen days after made extraordinary hot, and both all that while, and for fifteen days longer are stopp'd so close, that the least Air cannot get in or out of it; then the Oven is open'd, and the Vessels remaining therein left to cool by degrees; for if the glowing Vessels should be taken out of the Oven and put in|to the Air, they would crack to pieces like Glass; after the expiration of thirty days the Furnace is open'd in the presence of an Officer, appointed by the Em|peror for that purpose; who examining what is Bak'd, takes of every sort the fifth piece for the Empeor, by virtue of an ancient Law. 'Tis said, that of the pieces also of broken <HI>Porcelane,</HI> first beaten, and afterwards sifted, then mix'd with Water and kneaded in a Lump, are new Vessels made, but cannot be brought to their former lustre.</P>
<P>It is observable, that though some use the fresh Lumps which are brought to them, and make <HI>Porcelane</HI> of it, yet others, more curious, let them lie a while till they grow as hard as a Stone. The Earth thus dry'd, when they in|tend to use it, is beaten like the broken pieces of <HI>Porcelane,</HI> and also sifted and mix'd with Water, then kneaded into Lumps or Cakes, of which they make <HI>Porcelane</HI> as of the fresh Earth.</P>
<P>Besides the goodness of the Stuff, and curious fashioning, the <HI>Porcelane</HI> Ves|sels are of a high value, because they can endure extraordinary hot Liquors in them without cracking; also the pieces, if joyn'd with Iron, or small Cop|per Wyre, hold any Moisture without leaking.</P>
<P>Through all <HI>China</HI> are People which are experienc'd in this Art, and carry a curious small Drill, with a Diamond at the end thereof, with which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ake the Holes in the <HI>Porcelane.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>China</HI> are also divers sorts of Paper made, sometimes of Canes and the Leaves thereof, and sometimes of Cotton, Silk and Hemp: The Paper made of Cotton is not inferior in whiteness to the <HI>French</HI> Paper.</P>
<P><PB N="713" REF="323">In the County <HI>Vuchanfu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Huquang,</HI> is abundance of Paper made of Canes and the Leaves thereof, which grow there.</P>
<P>There is also good Paper made in the County <HI>Lucheufu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Kiangnan.</HI></P>
<P>There are more ways of making Paper among the <HI>Chineses</HI> (as <HI>Trigaut</HI> wit|nesseth) than among us: The same Author affirms, that the <HI>Chinese</HI> Paper is ve|ry rotten, apt to tear, and not durable; so that no Paper, whatsoever sort it be, can compare to ours in <HI>Europe:</HI> But whereas he saith, that it cannot bear on both sides to be Written or Printed, it is a meer mistake, because several sorts of <HI>Chinese</HI> Paper are found in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> which not only by the <HI>Hol|landers,</HI> but the <HI>Chineses</HI> also are written on both sides without the least sinking. The <HI>Chinese</HI> Paper is of several sizes, some two Foot and a half long, and two broad, some six Foot long, and three broad, which sort is brought from <HI>China</HI> into <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>China</HI> also in several places produces Sugar, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> Honey; and in the Moun|tains abundance of Salt-Petre.</P>

<P>THe <HI>Chineses</HI> in Colour and Complexion are like the People of <HI>Europe,</HI> especially those of the Northern Provinces, for those in the Southern, by reason of their Neighborhood to the Line and Heat of the Sun, are of a brown Complexion.</P>
<P>The Hair of their Beards is stiff and short, and appears not till full Man|hood; so that a <HI>Chinese</HI> of thirty years, looks a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Youthful as an <HI>European</HI> of twenty.</P>
<P>The Colour of the Hair, both of their Heads and Beards, is generally black, and it is accounted a dishonor in <HI>China</HI> to wear long Hair.</P>
<P>Their Eyes are small, somewhat oblong, black, and standing out: their Noses are small, and not high: their Ears of an indifferent bigness, in which the <HI>Chi|neses,</HI> as also in their other Features differ little from the <HI>European,</HI> though in some Provinces they have flat, and in a manner square Faces.</P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Quantung</HI> and <HI>Quangsi,</HI> most people on every little Toe have two Nails, which is also common amongst those of <HI>Cochin-China;</HI> and some say that in former times they had six Toes on every Foot.</P>
<P>All the Women are of little Stature, white Skins, brown Eyes, and extraor|dinary small Feet, in which last they account their chiefest Beauty to consist; for though a Woman be never so fair, yet she is accounted homely if she hath great Feet; insomuch, that the Mothers Swathe and Rowl up their Daugh|ters Feet from their Infancy, that by these Swathes (which they wear all their Life-time) they may prevent the natural growth of them: This Swathing of their Feet often occasions in tender Bodies such a pain, that they sometimes become lame of their Feet and decrepit; yet the Women generally Dance pret|tily, and make strange gestures with their bare Arms.</P>
<P>Some will have it, that this Swathing was inven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ed by some politick and jealous Person, that by this means they might be kept at home, and prevented from walking the Streets, which in that Countrey <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">edounds to the dishonor of the Women, and disesteem of the Men.</P>
<P><PB N="714" REF="324">But, as <HI>Martinius</HI> tells us, this Custom was deriv'd from <HI>Taquia,</HI> an ancient Empress of <HI>Che,</HI> who, though exceeding all other Women in Beauty, had ex|traordinary small Feet, which extreamly troubled her in going; her Wo|men hereupon in flattery imitated her, and also to make their Feet smaller Swath'd them; and this Custom to this day is of such Authority among them, that should they behold a second <HI>Helen,</HI> they would look upon her as a Monster if she had great Feet.</P>
<P>Others say, that <HI>Taquia</HI> was no Woman, but a Spirit in Female shape, with Goats Feet; which, because she would not have them discover'd, she kept con|tinually wrap'd up; and that from thence it hath also been a Custom for Wo|men to cover their Feet, which if they do not, it is accounted very ridiculous: Moreover, in this they resemble <HI>Taquia,</HI> that their Feet seem so little in their Shoes, that they appear no bigger than Goats Feet.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses,</HI> both Men and Women, before the Conquering of the Empire of <HI>China</HI> by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> are said to have wore long Hair on their Heads, with|out ever Shaving it, except Children, who till the fifteenth year of their Age Shav'd their Heads, only leaving a long Lock on their Crown; after that time they suffer'd their Hair to grow without Shaving, till they came to twenty years of age, (which was the time that Men putting on their Hat of Manhood, an ancient Custom like that of the <HI>Toga Virilis</HI> amongst the <HI>Romans</HI>) and let it hang loose over their Shoulders: In the twentieth year they ty'd up their Hair, and wore a Cap or Hat over it made of Horse-hair, or Silk; but this Cap was not us'd by the Women, who went only with their Hair ty'd up, and adorn'd with Gold, Silver, Precious-stones, and all manner of curious Flowers, and the like.</P>
<P>But there hath been since a great alteration in the Shaving and Wearing of their Hair; for all those <HI>Chineses</HI> which were subdu'd by them, were forc'd to Shave their Hair according to the <HI>Tartar</HI> fashion, only reserving one Lock be|hind on their Heads, wherefore the <HI>Hollanders</HI> generally call them <HI>Shaven Chi|neses,</HI> as those who refusing to submit to the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and to Shave off their Hair, joyn'd with the Rebel <HI>K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">xinga,</HI> are call'd <HI>Unshaven Chineses:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ut in for|mer times they took such a Pride in their long Hair, that they rather chose to Die, than lose the least Lock thereof; nor was it only Pride but something of Superstition that made them so concern'd in long Hair, for they like the <HI>Ma|humetants</HI> entertain'd a simple Imagination, that they should be pull'd up to Hea|ven by their Hair. Nevertheless, the Priests us'd in ancient times to Shave the Hair of their Heads and Beards every eighth day.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> also have a strange Opinion of themselves, accounting none equal to them, and looking upon all Affairs of foraign Kingdoms and People as not worthy their knowledge nor description; insomuch, that we find not any one Countrey which they have frequented with their Ships, mention'd in their Histories, when as they are very exact in the describing of those Coun|tries within their own Dominions: Moreover, all the Names with which they express foraign places are ridiculous, and signifying either <HI>Barbarians, Slaves,</HI> or the like, for they never take notice of the proper and true Names of Strangers; as for example, they ridiculously name the <HI>Iapanners Vocu,</HI> which by them signi|fies <HI>The Countrey of a</HI> Barba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ian <HI>Language;</HI> and the <HI>Tartars, Nucieu.</HI></P>
<P>All the Northern <HI>Chinefes,</HI> or the Inhabitants of the seven Northern Provinces, especially those of the Province of <HI>Peking,</HI> are Inferior to those of the Southern Provinces in Learning, Arts, and other Exercises of Ingenuity, but are Valianter and better Soldiers.</P>
<P><PB N="715" REF="324">In like manner, the Southern <HI>Chineses</HI> are very Politick and Civil, and the Northern Rough and Unpolish'd: As for the Inhabitants of the Province of <HI>Xensi,</HI> they are very Civil and Courteous, yet they are as dull in Learning as the other Northern <HI>Chineses.</HI> Those of the Province of <HI>Fokien</HI> are much inclin'd to Riot and Lasciviousness, yet are they Politick, of great Understanding, and subtile in the way of Merchandize, very full of Fraud: They are addicted to Literature, and have many Learned Persons among them; yet they are by the other <HI>Chineses</HI> accounted a People of a Salvage cruel Nature, as seeming to have retain'd some of the antique <HI>Barbarism,</HI> because they were the last that im|brac'd the present Laws and Customs of the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the little City <HI>Vu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">iven,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Quangsi,</HI> are in high credit amongst the <HI>Chineses</HI> for their Policy and Understanding; many of them being chosen for Governors and High-priests.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Xaohing,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> sends forth the most Ingeni|ous and best Orators in all <HI>China;</HI> insomuch, that there is scarce a Governor but hath one of this City for his Council.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the eleventh County <HI>Vencheufu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Cheki|ang,</HI> have been of old much given to the abominable Sin of <HI>Sodomy,</HI> which is grown so habitual among them, that neither Law nor shame restrains them from acting it publickly.</P>
<P>Several Mountains lying in the twelfth County of <HI>Xincheufu,</HI> in the Pro|vince<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Vulinman,</HI> or wild <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">|ple.</NOTE> of <HI>Huquang,</HI> are inhabited by Wild and Salvage People call'd <HI>Vulinman:</HI> Concerning the Original of these People, the <HI>Chinese</HI> Writers give us this fabu|lous account.</P>
<P>King <HI>Kaosin</HI> Warring against a Robber nam'd <HI>U,</HI> was driven by him to ut|most extremity, for the Robbers. Valor and Experience in War was such, that he often Defeated King <HI>Kaosin,</HI> and Routed all his Forces; wherefore <HI>Kaosin</HI> caus'd to be Proclaim'd amongst his Souldiers, that he would give twenty thou|sand Ounces of Silver and a City, with his youngest Daughter, to any one that would bring him the General <HI>U</HI>'s Head: While this Edict was in force, King <HI>Kaosin's</HI> Dog call'd <HI>Puonho,</HI> ran into the Enemies Army, which lay at that time Incamp'd in a Wood, and killing the General <HI>U,</HI> brought his Head to the King, who exceedingly rejoyc'd at the Death of so great an Enemy, yet thought himself not oblig'd to perform what the Proclamation had promis'd, as concluding it very unseemly for a Beast to Marry a Woman: Which his Daughter hearing, urg'd the Sacredness of the Edict, and of the King's Word, which ought not to be broke; and thereupon she was Marry'd to the Dog, by whom, in six years time she had six Sons and six Daughters, who by Marrying one another, bred a Generation of Dog-like Natur'd People.</P>
<P>But it is to be suppos'd, that this Fable was feign'd by the <HI>Chineses,</HI> because they accounted none to be Humane, which are not of their Countrey, or ob|serve their Laws.</P>
<P>Yet in the Journal of a <HI>Monk,</HI> written in the second Book of <HI>Navigation and Travels,</HI> Collected by <HI>M. Gio Baptista Ramusio,</HI> we find this for the confirmation of these Dogs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Tartars</HI> returning through the Wildernesses, came to a Countrey, in which (as the <HI>Ruthens,</HI> which had been there, relate) they found a Generati|on of Wild Women, who after they had been ask'd by several Interpreters what People they were that Inhabited that Countrey, answer'd, <HI>That all the Women of that place were of humane shape, but the Men like Dogs:</HI> And that upon this
<PB N="716" REF="325">
occasion, whilst the <HI>Tartars</HI> stay'd in this Countrey, the Dogs met together on one side of the River, and leap'd (being Winter) into the Water, and after|wards roul'd themselves in the Sand, which by the excessive cold, Froze up|on them, and Arm'd them with a kind of a Coat of Mail: This having done several times together, the <HI>Tartars</HI> falling upon them, threw their Darts at them; but the Dogs running amongst the midst of them, made a great slaugh|ter among them, and drove the <HI>Tartars</HI> out of the Countrey, and took Posses|sion thereof. Thus far <HI>Baptista.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the eighth County <HI>Taiping,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Quangsi,</HI> are by a <HI>Chinese</HI> Writer call'd <HI>Barbarians,</HI> because (having cast off the <HI>Chinese</HI> Laws and Government) they go bare-footed like Salvage People, and live without Law, Rule, Order, or Decency, killing one another upon every slight occasion.</P>
<P>Also on the Mountains in the ninth County <HI>Cuncheufu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Kiangsi,</HI> there live many wild People, which (according to the Relation of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Writers) live after a Salvage and Bestial manner.</P>
<P>Likewise on the Mountains in the Province of <HI>Queicheu</HI> inhabit a People, for the most part Wild and untractable, for they observe not the <HI>Chinese</HI> Laws or Customs, but live of themselves under several Governors of their own Elections: They often Sally out upon the <HI>Chineses</HI> which live near them, sometimes forcing them to a Peace, which at their pleasure they break again, never suffering any that are not for their way of Living to come amongst them.</P>
<P>To reduce this Countrey to Reason, the Emperors have often sent Forces thither, but with little success that ever was heard of.</P>
<P>Those of <HI>Queiyangfu,</HI> in the time of the Family <HI>Taiming,</HI> first apply'd them|selves to study the Learning and Customs of the <HI>Chineses,</HI> by which means not a few of them have attain'd to the highest degree thereof.</P>
<P>The People of the second County <HI>Sucheufu,</HI> of the Province of <HI>Queicheu</HI> are strong Limb'd and Valiant, and withal, Courteous and Civil, yet have some|thing of Wild in their manner of Living; they go with their Hair loose, bare-footed, and the Soles of their Feet have contracted such a hard Cal|losity, that they fear not to tread on the sharpest Stones, and most prickly Thornes.</P>
<P>Those of the third County, though somewhat of a Salvage Nature, yet they have mix'd therewith a kind of Clownish Civility.</P>
<P>The Mountaineers of the sixth County <HI>Tungganfu,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Quei|cheu,</HI> were formerly the most Cruel and Barbarous People in all that Province, Proud of themselves, Fraudulent, and having a Custom among them to kill their old People; but have of late, by their conversing with the other <HI>Chineses,</HI> learnt something of Morality.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Hinghoa,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> is famous for the Industrious|ness of its Inhabitants, in Learning, Arts, and ingenious Faculties.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the seventh County <HI>Yancheufu,</HI> of the Province of <HI>Kiang|nan,</HI> are much inclin'd to Lasciviousness.</P>
<P>The Northern Mountaineers, as in the County of the Garrison'd City <HI>Pu|ting,</HI> of the Province of <HI>Queicheu,</HI> trouble not themselves with Learning, Man|ners, or Civility, every one doing what they please, living without Laws or Go|vernment.</P>
<P><PB N="717" REF="325">The Inhabitants of the Mountain near the Garrison'd City <HI>Lungli</HI> have by their Conversing with the neighboring <HI>Chineses</HI> learn'd several of their Customs; yet going always Arm'd delight in War and the noise of Arms.</P>
<P>Those of the Province of <HI>Kiangsi</HI> are politick and subtle, and many of them attain to the highest degree of Literature, and thereby are rais'd to great Pre|ferments.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the City <HI>Sucheu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Nanking,</HI> are exceed|ingly inclin'd to dainty and delicious Fare, and love the Art of Candying and Preserving in Sugar.</P>
<P>All the Inhabitants of the ninth County <HI>Ningpofu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Chekiang,</HI> are great lovers of salt Meats, whereupon this proverbial Sentence passes upon them, <HI>That they cannot rot after Death, being so much sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ted during Life.</HI></P>
<P>The People of the Province of <HI>Iunnan,</HI> by reason of their Neighborhood to <HI>India,</HI> participate with them in their Customs; and the main thing wherein they differ from the rest of the <HI>Chineses</HI> is this, namely, that whereas in all parts of <HI>China</HI> besides they Lock their Women up in their Houses, and suffer them not to be spoken with or seen by any Man, or ever to come out of their Houses into the Streets, here the Women walk abroad upon their occasions as in <HI>Eu|rope.</HI> They exceed the rest of the <HI>Chineses</HI> in Courage and Valour, being ne|ver daunted at the Engaging of an Enemy, and training up their Elephants to War. They are friendly, Courteous, and Civil to Strangers, and more tracta|ble to embrace the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion than any of the <HI>Chineses</HI> besides.</P>
<P>On the North-side of the fourth County <HI>Cuihungfu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Iun|nan,</HI> before the <HI>Tartars</HI> coming into <HI>China</HI> in the time of the Family <HI>Iuen,</HI> dwelt a People call'd <HI>Kinchi,</HI> that is, <HI>Golden-Teeth,</HI> because they us'd to cover their Teeth with thin Plates of Gold; which is also a Custom amongst those of the eighth Garrison'd City in the same Province.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the twelfth County <HI>Xunningfu</HI> in the same Province, are very barbarous and inhumane; some of them take pleasure to make their Teeth black; others Paint several Images on their Faces, rubbing in their Skin, first pierc'd with a Needle, a kind of black Colour.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the first Garrison'd City <HI>Kiocing</HI> of the same Province, are good Husband-men, but very litigious, often spending in Law that which they have labour'd for the whole year, and all for a trifle; yet they are not the onely People possess'd with this fond humor, but may be paralell'd in this Nation, especially in some parts of <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>The People of the second Garrison'd City <HI>Yaogan,</HI> in the same Province, are (according to the <HI>Chinese</HI> Writers) prodigiously strong, and therefore delight more in War than Peace.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of the third Garrison'd City <HI>Cioking</HI> in the same Province, are valiant, prudent, and stout People; they Fight generally with Bowes and Arrows.</P>
<P>Though the Inhabitants of the sixth Garrison'd City <HI>Likiang,</HI> Extracted from the ancient'st Inhabitants of <HI>China,</HI> do not fully observe the <HI>Chinese</HI> Laws, be|cause of their nearness to other People, whose Customs they have learn'd, yet nevertheless they partly observe those of the <HI>Chineses:</HI> They are very much ad|dicted to Drinking and Jollity, spending whole Days and Nights in Singing, Dancing and Revelling; they are good Horsemen, and use Bowes and Ar|rows.</P>
<P>It is scarce to be believ'd, how strictly the Women (I mean those of high
<PB N="718" REF="326">
Quality, for the ordinary Women walk the Streets) are kept through all <HI>China,</HI> from the natural jealousie of the People: Their Residences are made after such a manner, that they cannot see nor be seen by others: They are seldom permitted to go out, except on extraordinary occasions, and are carry'd in Sedans made for that purpose, and so closely shut, that there is not the least Crevise through which they may be seen. Moreover, they spend their time in breeding little Dogs, Birds, and the like.</P>

<HEAD>Characters and Languages.</HEAD>
<P>THe <HI>Chineses</HI> have no Letters like the People of <HI>Europe,</HI> and other parts of the World, which any way agree in a certain Order or Rule of an Al|phabet, neither have they any such thing as Vowels and Consonants, or other Literals that can be joyn'd to make Words of; but they have Cha|racters, Signs, or Images, or what you please to name them, in stead of the Letters of the Alphabet, for every Word or Name which they speak hath a certain Figure or Character, by which it is express'd: This Figure consists in Strokes and Specks, which as they differ in shape, so in signification one from another; they are joyn'd without Art or Method, as it were by accident ex|pressing the Name or Thing which they design: Therefore the <HI>Chineses</HI> use as many Figures or Characters as there are Things which they would express.</P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses</HI> (saith <HI>Trigaut</HI>) express not with any Letters of the Alphabet their Language in Writing, as almost all other People on the Earth, but draw as many Figures or Characters as there are Words and Things to signifie; so that if any one would Translate a Dictionary out of <HI>English</HI> into their Language, he would need as many several Characters as there are Words. As to what concerns the number of these Characters, though according to the greatness of any Sub|ject, the more of them are requir'd, yet they have brought them all within the compass of seventy or eighty thousand; all which stand written in order in a Book call'd <HI>Haipien:</HI> besides which there is another much shorter (which teaches to Read, Write, and Understand their Books) which at most contains not above eight or ten thousand. If in their Reading they chance to meet with a Word which they understand not, then they turn to their great Dictionary, like one who learns the <HI>Latine</HI> or <HI>French</HI> Tongue; by which we may conclude, that the more Characters the <HI>Chineses</HI> know, the more Learned they are accounted: therefore it must be one of an exceeding Memory, that will be reckon'd a Scho|lar amongst them.</P>
<P><HI>Kircher</HI> tells us, That at this day none are accounted amongst the number of the eminently Learned, which have not attain'd to the perfect knowledge of eighty thousand Characters, though any one that will learn to speak the Lan|guage hath enough of ten thousand: Neither do the <HI>Chineses</HI> themselves know all these Characters, the vulgar Person learning no more than he thinks may serve him in his way of Trading.</P>
<P>In like manner saith <HI>Trigaut,</HI> He that knows ten thousand Characters, hath obtain'd those which are commonly us'd in Writing.</P>
<P><HI>Martinius</HI> makes the learning of the <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters so hard, that to know them throughly requires a whole Age, for he affirms, that he spent ten years in the learning of them, and yet at the expiration of that time, he had attain'd no farther knowledge of them, than to understand a small Prayer-Book.</P>
<P>It is strange to consider, that the <HI>Chineses</HI> make the great distinction of their
<PB N="719" REF="326">
vast number of Characters by no more than nine Specks, by adding or leaving out any of which, another signification is produc'd: As for Exaample, one straight Stroke thus&mdash;signifies <HI>One;</HI> the same Stroke, cut through with ano|ther like a Cross in this manner &dagger; signifies <HI>Tzi,</HI> or <HI>Ten;</HI> another being added to the bottom of the Cross &dagger; signifies <HI>Thou,</HI> or <HI>Earth;</HI> and with a third on the top &dagger; <HI>Vam,</HI> that is, <HI>King;</HI> one Speck being added on the left-side of the uppermost Stroke &dagger; signifies <HI>Iu,</HI> or <HI>Gu,</HI> that is, <HI>A Pearl;</HI> and so all kinds of Minerals, Plants, Animals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> by the different position of Specks and Lines.</P>
<P>But this Rule, saith <HI>Semedo,</HI> is not always certain&punc; for the <HI>Chineses</HI> not onely joyn several Lines <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">nto one Figure, but make divers of their Significations by joyning two or more whole Figures together; so that a square Figure which signifies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Sun,</HI> joyn'd to another, signifies the <HI>Moon,</HI> and being added to a third of the same form, expresses <HI>Min,</HI> that is, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">:</HI> To signifie a <HI>Door</HI> they draw a Figure like it, which they call <HI>Muen;</HI> and to signifie the <HI>Heart,</HI> a Figure like a <HI>Heart:</HI> To express <HI>Melancholy,</HI> or <HI>Sadness,</HI> the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> put the Character which expresses a <HI>Heart</HI> in the middle of that of a <HI>Door,</HI> as if the Heart found it self oppress'd in the entrance of a narrow Door: And because Sorrow hath its seat in the Heart, they always add the Figure of a <HI>Heart</HI> to all those Characters with which they express any kind of sorrowful Object or Consideration.</P>
<P>These Characters are generally us'd, not onely in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ll the fifteen Provinces of the whole Empire of <HI>China,</HI> but also in <HI>Iapan, Corea, Cochinchina, Tungking, Camboya,</HI> and <HI>Sionei,</HI> though every Countrey hath a peculiar Language. By this means the <HI>Iapanners, Cochin-Chineses, Chineses, Coreans,</HI> and <HI>Tungkingans,</HI> can under|stand one anothers Books, as being all written in the fore-mention'd Chara|cters; yet cannot speak with, nor understand one another: In like manner as the Figures of <HI>Arithmetick</HI> are us'd all <HI>Europe</HI> over, and understood by all the se|veral Nations thereof, yet the words with which they are express'd differ very much; for these <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters are signs of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> things which they signifie, and are by all in general understood: therefore it is one thing to know the <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters, and another to speak their Language; insomuch that a Foreigner endu'd with a great Memory, may by often reading the <HI>Chinese</HI> Books, attain to the highest degree of their Learning, though he cannot Dis|course with, nor understand them.</P>
<P>These <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters seem to be of the same Original with the People themselves; for (according to some of their ancient Histories) they have been in use amongst them three thousand seven hundred and thirty years. Many ascribe the first Invention of them to the Emperor <HI>Fohi,</HI> who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> to Reign <HI>Anno</HI> 2952. before the <HI>Incarnation,</HI> and (according to <HI>Kircher</HI>) three hundred years before the <HI>Flood.</HI> But it is to be observ'd, that the old <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters differ'd much from the modern; for the first <HI>Chineses</HI> took not their significations from joint Figures, but, from the representation of natural things, as Birds, Beasts, In|sects, Fishes, Herbs, Trees, Minerals, and the like; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">y which, put in order, and joyn'd several ways, the <HI>Chineses</HI> at first declar'd their Thoughts and Appre|hensions.</P>
<P>When they treated of fiery things, they us'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> and Dragons, which being plac'd in several orders, had such and such significations; and in ex|pressing aerial things, they made Figures of Birds; and for watry, Fishes; for earthly things&punc; Beasts, Plants, Trees and Leaves; for Stars, Specks and Cir|cles; and in like manner for things of another nature.</P>
<P><PB N="720" REF="327">The forms of the ancient <HI>Chinese</HI> Characters were of seventeen sorts: The first, invented by the Emperor <HI>Fohi,</HI> consisted (according to their Chronicles) of Serpents and Dragons; wherefore the Book which he writ of <HI>Astronomy</HI> is call'd <HI>The Book of Dragons:</HI> In it are Serpents strangely twisted together, and in several forms, after the manner of those things which they signifie there|with: But at this day few <HI>Chineses</HI> understand these Characters, Age having worn out the knowledge of them.</P>

<P>The third sort consists in the placing of several Feathers of the Bird <HI>Tunghoa|hang,</HI> which is by them accounted the best Bird that flies. It is said that the Emperor <HI>Xanghoang</HI> us'd the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e Characters in his Book of Birds.</P>
<P>The fourth sort consists of Shell-fishes and Insects.</P>

<P>The sixth, of the Feet of Birds, which the Emperor <HI>Choanghang</HI> us'd.</P>

<P>The sixteenth cannot be read nor understood.</P>
<P>The seventeenth and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">st sort was us'd for Superscriptions on Letters, Deeds, Bonds, and the like.</P>
<P>But the modern <HI>Chineses</HI> grown wiser by Experience, and finding a great confusion and trouble in the representing of so many Beasts, Plants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) in|vented a far shorter way of joyning Specks and Lines together.</P>

<P>The Inhabitants of the County <HI>Taipin</HI> in the Province of <HI>Quangsi,</HI> speak quite another Language from the <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner those of the seventh County <HI>Lipingfu</HI> of the Province of <HI>Queicheu,</HI> speak a different Language, altogether unknown to the other <HI>Chi|neses.</HI></P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Fokien</HI> the Inhabitants use not one Dialect but every County hath a peculiar Speech, insomuch that the one cannot understand the other.</P>
<P>Those of the Province of <HI>Fokien,</HI> who speak a gross and ungraceful Language, use in stead of <HI>N</HI> the Letter <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"></HI> for <HI>Nanking</HI> is by them call'd <HI>Lanking;</HI> the Suburbs
<PB N="721" REF="327">
of <HI>Hoksieu</HI> or <HI>Focheu, Lanthai;</HI> which the <HI>Portuguese</HI> and <HI>Hollanders,</HI> with whom they Trade, have follow'd.</P>
<P>Those of the second County <HI>Sucheufu</HI> in the Province of <HI>Queicheu,</HI> knew no|thing of any Letters formerly, though they express'd themselves by writing Figures on Boards, but have lately learn'd the vulgar Characters.</P>
<P>Besides the several Dialects belonging properly to each Province, after the reducing of them to one sole Empire, another Language was instituted, which was made common through the whole Realm. This Language is by the <HI>Chineses</HI> nam'd <HI>Quonhoa</HI> or <HI>Quonthoa,</HI> that is, <HI>Court,</HI> or <HI>Pleading Tongue;</HI> because it is most us'd at Court, by the <HI>Mandarins,</HI> Governors and Magistrates: It is also known by the Name of <HI>The Mandarins Language,</HI> but is least of all us'd in the Province of <HI>Fokien.</HI> This was done, because it hapned oftentimes that all the Magistrates were Foreigners or Strangers in the Province, where by the Emperors Order they were plac'd, and that they might not be necessitated to learn a strange Language, there was a general one Instituted in the whole Empire.</P>
<P>In this Language they not onely try Causes, but all well bred People or Strangers speak the same with the Natives in every Province, in the same man|ner as the <HI>English, French, Italians, Germans,</HI> and other People use the <HI>Latine</HI> Tongue through all <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Iesuits</HI> which are sent to <HI>China</HI> to promulgate the <HI>Christian</HI> Religion, learn all of them this general Language, because those which belong'd to each se|veral Province are neither useful nor elegant, nor spoken by People of Qua|lity, except in their Houses to their Servants, or in other Countreys, thereby to put them in mind of their Native Countrey. This Language is also spoken by Women and Children, because long custom hath conquer'd the difficulty of learning it. Tradesmen speak the Language of their own Province; and though they all understand the <HI>Mandarins</HI> Tongue, yet they speak it not.</P>
<P>This general <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue is very brief and short, and though rich and abounding in Characters above all other Languages, yet inferior to them in scarcity of words; for the number of the words exceed not sixteen hundred, and according to <HI>Semedo,</HI> not above three hundred twenty six. All the words end almost in a Vowel, yet some few of them with <HI>M</HI> or <HI>N;</HI> and (which is re|markable in this Language) there are no Dissyllables or Polysyllables, but all Monosyllables, or words consisting of one syllable onely, I mean all radical and fundamental words, for Appellatives or Names of Places and Things, are compounded of two or three words clapt together, as <HI>Tunghoafung</HI> of <HI>Fung,</HI> a Bird, <HI>Hoa</HI> a Flower, and <HI>Tung</HI> the Name of the Flower: and herein it is para|lell'd even by our <HI>English</HI> Tongue, whose fundamental words being originally <HI>Saxon,</HI> are for the most part Monosyllable, as <HI>Tree, Stone, Hand, Eye,</HI> &amp;c. It hath many Diphthongs, or double Vowels joyn'd together in one syllable, I say Vow|els after our way of speaking, meaning the force of Vowels; for Vowels are no us'd by the <HI>Chineses,</HI> but as every thing, so every word hath its peculiar Sign: wherefore&punc; it may be ask'd, Are there so many Signs in so small a number of words as the <HI>Chineses</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">? or, How can they with so few words express all things which their thoughts comprehend? In answer hereof I say, That the <HI>Chinese</HI> Language is very comprehensive, that is to say, it hath few words, but oftentimes one word signifies ten or twenty several things, which are not to be distinguish'd but by the different sound and pronunciation in speaking, which distinction is so small, that Strangers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">an scarce observe the same; insomuch
<PB N="722" REF="328">
that one might say, this Language was rather Artificially invented, than Na|turally proceeding from the necessity of Discourse; therefore they that will rightly understand the sense of the words, had need be as attentive to the Tone in Speaking, as the Accent in Writing.</P>
<P>To make the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue the easier, (for it is very hard to learn) the <HI>Iesu|its</HI> have from the Method of Musical Notes, as <HI>Ut, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol,</HI> taught to know the high and low Sounds which the <HI>Chineses</HI> observe in their Speaking: To this purpose <HI>Iacob Pantoja</HI> first found out these five Signs, which written over the <HI>Chinese</HI> words after the <HI>European</HI> manner, are thus express'd <GAP DESC="foreign">. And by these five Marks of Sound, Foraigners learn the Language, though not without great Pains and Study; partly, because of the manifold Characters of the words, and partly, by reason of the difficulty of hitting upon the several Tones or Sounds.</P>
<P>The first Sign of the five Sounds or Tones mark'd thus <GAP DESC="foreign">, agrees with <HI>Ut</HI> in Musick; and the Sound or Pronounciation is in the <HI>Chinese</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Cho Pim,</HI> as if they would say, <HI>The first agreeable Tone.</HI> The second Sign <GAP DESC="foreign"> agrees with <HI>Re,</HI> in <HI>Chinese</HI> call'd <HI>Pim Xim,</HI> that is, <HI>A clear and even Voice.</HI> The third Sign <GAP DESC="foreign"> agrees with <HI>Mi;</HI> this Sound in <HI>Chinese</HI> is call'd <HI>Xam Xim,</HI> that is, <HI>High Voice.</HI> The fourth Sign <GAP DESC="foreign"> agrees with <HI>Fa,</HI> and is by the <HI>Chineses</HI> nam'd, <HI>Kiu Xim,</HI> that is, <HI>High Voice of the Goer.</HI> The fifth U agrees with <HI>Sol,</HI> and is by the <HI>Chineses</HI> call'd <HI>Ge Xim,</HI> that is, <HI>Proper Voice of the Enterer.</HI></P>
<P>According as any word written in <HI>European</HI> Letters is mark'd with these Signs, it must be utter'd in a different Voice or Sound, as it is written by the <HI>Chi|neses</HI> with several Characters, and hath also there its several significations: As for example, the word <HI>Ia,</HI> written with <HI>European</HI> Letters, according as it is mark'd with any' of the five Signs, signifies several things, and must also be ut|ter'd with a difference of Sounds; for the Word or Syllable <HI>I&acirc;,</HI> with this Sign <GAP DESC="foreign"> signifies <HI>A Tooth; Ia~</HI> with a strait Stroke, <HI>A Voice; I&agrave;</HI> with a sloaping Stroke towards the Left, <HI>Excellent; I&aacute;</HI> with a sloaping Stroke towards the Right, <HI>A Deafness; I&abreve;</HI> with a Semi-Circle, <HI>He Goes.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner, the Syllable <HI>Ko,</HI> is by the <HI>Chineses</HI> Ton'd ten several ways, and each Tone hath a peculiar signification; as also, each signification a pecu|liar Mark, whereby it is distinguish'd from the other; so that no Language in the whole world is so Univocal or containing so many several meanings under one word as the <HI>Chinese;</HI> and the Marks that distinguish the significations of a word by the Accent, are so many, that the difference of Sound can scarce be discern'd in all; insomuch, that not any one Book can be understood from a Reader by the Auditor, an Ocular Inspection being absolutely necessary to di|stinguish by the Marks the difference of the Sound, and by consequence, the double sense of the words, which cannot be distinguish'd by the Ear; nay, that which is more, it often happens in their Speaking, that when one cannot understand the others sense, notwithstanding he speaks plain and distinctly, he is not only necessitated to repeat his Discourse, but also to write it; and if they chance not to have Pen or Paper, they do it with Water on a Table, or with their Fingers in the Air, or express the meaning with the Hand of the Auditor: This happens most amongst the Learned and Eloquent part of the People, who study to speak more exact and quai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">t than ordinary, according as they write in their Books.</P>
<P>The reason of the Univocalness of this Language seems to proceed from no|thing else, but that these People from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ll Ages have endeavour'd more to write
<PB N="723" REF="328">
well than speak well, because their best Language to this day consists in Wri|ting and not in Speaking; therefore it also happens, that Messages are not deli|ver'd by word of Mouth, but in Writing, though it be in one and the same City; for though this Language be very scanty of words, nevertheless, it is the pleasing|est and most ingenious of all others; for whereas in any action we cannot express the manner of doing but in several words, the <HI>Chineses</HI> often comprehend it in one word: As for example, the word <HI>Nien,</HI> among them signifies <HI>Taking hold with two Fingers;</HI> Tzo, <HI>Taking hold with all the Fingers:</HI> In like manner, we make several uses of the word <HI>Are,</HI> when we say <HI>They are a Bed, are at Table, are at the Tavern;</HI> but the <HI>Chineses</HI> express the being and manner of being in one word; we also say, <HI>The Foot of a Man, the Foot of a Bird, the Foot of a Beast,</HI> never omit|ting to add the word <HI>Foot:</HI> But the <HI>Chineses</HI> to express the Foot of a Man, say, <HI>Kio,</HI> that of a Bird, <HI>Cua,</HI> that of a four footed Beast <HI>Thi.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Chineses,</HI> considering they have no Alphabet, are accustom'd from their Infancy to express themselves by this way of sign'd Sounds, and very much wonder how we of <HI>Europe</HI> can write down their Words in <HI>Latin</HI> Letters, and pronounce the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> so plainly.</P>
<P>They use not the Sound of the Letter <HI>R.</HI> which they cannot Pronounce, nor ever put two Consonants together, without a Vowel between; so that to this day they call the <HI>Franks, Falankes,</HI> by whom perhaps, they, as well as the <HI>Moors,</HI> understand all the People of <HI>Europe,</HI> except the <HI>Greeks.</HI></P>
<P>A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> for the Language of the <HI>Tartars</HI> it is much easier to learn, seeming in some measure to agree with the <HI>Persian,</HI> and having some Characters or Letters like the <HI>Arabick.</HI></P>
<P>The Alphabet of this Language is said to consist of sixty several Letters, which may the rather be, because some of them have the force of Consonant and Vowel joyn'd in one, as <HI>La, Le, Li, Lo, Lu; Pa, Pe, Pi, Po, Pu.</HI></P>
<P>In Reading they descend down-wards like the <HI>Chineses,</HI> and proceed from the Right to the Left side, as anciently the <HI>Hebrews</HI> and other Easterly Nations, and at this day the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Chineses.</HI></P>
