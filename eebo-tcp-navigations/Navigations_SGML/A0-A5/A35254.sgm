<P>THat Tract of Land called <HI>Guinea,</HI> comprehends &s;even hundred Lea|gues from <HI>Cap Verd</HI> in fourteen Degrees of North Latitude, and nineteen of Ea&s;t Longitude to Cape <HI>Gon&s;alvo</HI> in the fir&s;t Degree of Southern Latitude, and thirty of Ea&s;t Longitude; The <HI>Portugals</HI> were the fir&s;t that ranged this Shore, and having &s;ome Intelligence of their Commodities, and the manner of Trading with them; by fair means and force together, they got footing up|on the Sea coa&s;ts, building Forts in &s;ome, and
<PB N="2" REF="4">placing Garri&s;ons and Factories in other places, which they then found &s;uch a Golden Trade, that they called &s;ome Coa&s;ts thereof by that name, and perceiving it &s;o beneficial to them|&s;elves and their Countrey, it was an induce|ment (as what will not Gold attract) to their further &s;earch on the&s;e Maritine Coa&s;ts all along to the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> and thereby con&s;equently to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> The fair quar|ter, and courteous u&s;age, which the Inhabi|tants received from the <HI>Portugals</HI> already &s;etled there, incouraged them to exchange their Commodities with them, which Trade accord|ing to the Cu&s;tom of that Kingdom was main|tained by Factors, upon the King of <HI>Portugals</HI> particular account in every Port and Town, as if he intended the profits of Merchandizing &s;hould defray the charges of his Conque&s;ts and Garri&s;ons, furni&s;hing the Natives with Salt, Iron, Tin, Copper, Ba&s;ons, Knives, Cloth, Linnen, and other <HI>European</HI> Goods, and re|ceiving in exchange, partly Cattle, Corn, Rice, and the like, but chiefly Gold it &s;elf in great abundance, both in Sand and melted Ingots, which gave Life and Briskne&s;s to the further Di&s;covery of tho&s;e Countreys, and continuance of that Trade to this very day, though not &s;o con&s;iderable as formerly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and other Nations, de&s;irous to &s;hare in this Rich Trade, in &s;hort time Sailed thither, and becau&s;e they had no Forts to Pro|tect
<PB N="3" REF="4">their Per&s;ons and Goods from the danger of the <HI>Portugals,</HI> and treachery of the Inhabi|tants, they were compelled to Anchor along the Coa&s;ts near the greate&s;t Towns of Con|cour&s;e, and &s;ignifying to the <HI>Negroes</HI> what Wares they had brought, by their plau&s;ible demeanor, they at length imboldened them to come aboard their Ships, and bring their Gold, the manner of which Trade was very different from that of any other Countrey; For be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">imes in the Morning, the wind being then generally off the Shore, and the weather calm, the Na|tives came aboard in their Canoes and Scutes to Traffique &s;ome for them&s;elves, and &s;ome as Factors for others, carrying at their Girdles a Pur&s;e, wherein were &s;everal &s;mall Clouts or Papers, containing the Gold belonging &s;ome|times to ten &s;everal Men, which though all of the &s;ame weight and goodne&s;s, yet they readily di&s;tingui&s;ht, and having made their bargains for Cloth, Linnen, or the like, at Noon they return'd with the Seabrize again to the Shore; but be&s;ide the agreement, the&s;e Factors have &s;ome &s;mall thing for them&s;elves, in reward for their Brokage, but in proce&s;s of time, the <HI>Hol|landers</HI> frequenting the&s;e Coa&s;ts, and being well acquainted with the manner of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Traf|fique, and coming into the &s;ame places where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Traded and were known, they &s;oon &s;poiled this Golden Trade, by their &s;ini&s;ter and indirect dealing, for Anchoring with the
<PB N="4" REF="5"><HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> whom they found to have a better Trade than them&s;elves, they &s;ecretly bribed tho&s;e Factors aforementioned to carry their Pa&s;&s;engers and Merchants aboard their own Ships, and not the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> obliging them to Trade only with the <HI>Dutch;</HI> Which Craft the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> perceiving, u&s;ed the &s;ame Arts to in|gage the Factors to them&s;elves, &s;o that out-try|ing each other, the&s;e Brokers commonly gain|ed to them&s;elves &s;ix or &s;even <HI>per Cent.</HI> to the va&s;t prejudice of all Trade upon the&s;e Coa&s;ts, for the future, &s;ince this ill Cu&s;tom mu&s;t be kept up by all Succeeding <HI>European</HI> Mer|chants;</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved that many <HI>Negro</HI> Merchants who dwelt up in the Countrey coming to buy Wares of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> with great quantities of Gold, and divers Slaves, thirty or more accord|ing to their Quality, to carry back the Goods they &s;hould purcha&s;e, and taking their Lodg|ings in the Hou&s;es of the&s;e Brokers, whom they acquainted with their full Commi&s;&s;ions and Intentions, and to whom they delivered their Gold, the&s;e Factors would go aboard the <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Ships with them to Trade and Barter, and if the <HI>Negro</HI> Merchants were not skilled in the <HI>Portugal</HI> Tongue, the&s;e Brokers would bid the <HI>Hollanders</HI> not to &s;peak the <HI>Mori&s;co</HI> Language to them, becau&s;e they Inhabited far within the Land, thereby giving the <HI>Dutch</HI> the watch-word, that they meant to deceive
<PB N="5" REF="5">their Countreymen, and afterward divide the Spoil, &s;o that the knavi&s;h Factor connived at the extravagant prizes of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to draw the more Gold from the Merchant, whom he likewi&s;e cheated, &s;ometimes by put|ting &s;ome of his Gold into his Mouth, Ears, or otherwi&s;e, which the Merchant <HI>Negro</HI> finding wanting in the Scale, adds to the Cheat him|&s;elf by blowing into the Chri&s;tians Ballance to make it weight; The bargain being fini&s;hed, and the <HI>Negro</HI> again landed, the Factor re|turns back to the Ship, to &s;hare his ill got gains with the <HI>Flemings;</HI> This way of pro|ceeding was very detrimental to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and other Chri&s;tians that Trade upon the&s;e Coa&s;ts, &s;o that unle&s;s they likewi&s;e connive with the&s;e Factors, their Voyage will be lo&s;t, and their Commodities un&s;old.</P>
<P>In 1553. <HI>Thomas Windam,</HI> and <HI>Anthony Pintado</HI> a <HI>Portugal,</HI> in two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships Tra|ded along the&s;e Coa&s;ts as far as <HI>Benin,</HI> where they pre&s;ented them&s;elves to the King who &s;ate in a great Hall, the Walls whereof were made of Earth without Windows, the Roof of thin Boards, open in divers places; his Nobles ne|ver look him in the Face, but &s;it with their Buttocks on the ground, and their hands be|fore their Faces, not looking up till the King commands them; when they depart they go backward, turning their Faces &s;till toward him. The next year Captain <HI>John Lock</HI> Sailed
<PB N="6" REF="6">into the&s;e Parts to Trade for Gold and Ele|phants Teeth; And after him Captain <HI>Tower|&s;on</HI> made &s;everal Voyages thither, who at the River St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> ob&s;erved a kind of Pea&s;e growing on the Shore like Trees, with &s;talks twenty &s;even paces long; At Cape <HI>Tres Puntas,</HI> they made him Swear by the Water of the Sea, that he would not hurt them, before they would Trade with him; <HI>Aban</HI> a <HI>Negro</HI> King treated them kindly with a Pot of Palm or Coco-Wine, which they draw out of Trees.</P>
<P>The People are hand&s;om and well propor|tioned, having nothing di&s;agreeable in their Countenances, but the blackne&s;s of their Com|plexion, &s;ome of them have flatti&s;h No&s;es, all little Ears, my <HI>Dutch</HI> Author who writ &s;ome years &s;ince relates, that the People go all Na|ked till they are married, and then are cloth|ed from the middle to the knees; At the Mar|riage of their Daughters, they give half an Ounce of Gold to buy Wine for the Wedding, the Bride in the pre&s;ence of her Friends &s;wears to be true to her Husband, which the man doth not, for they have as many Wives as they can maintain, yet the fir&s;t has this preheminence, that he can never take another but by her per|mi&s;&s;ion, but becau&s;e the multitude of Wives and Children are counted the greate&s;t honour and riches in that Countrey, they often per&s;uade their Husbands to take more, and glory there|in, the fir&s;t Wife likewi&s;e has the priviledge to
<PB N="7" REF="6">lye with her Husband three Nights &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, whil&s;t the re&s;t mu&s;t be content only with one, &s;o that they live very quietly together, a Merchant or Captain will have thirty or forty, the King of <HI>Benin</HI> had &s;ix hundred, wherewith he went in Solemn Proce&s;&s;ion every year; The King of <HI>Fetu</HI>'s Son had fourteen Sons and twelve Daughters, and kept an hundred Slaves to wait upon them; At <HI>Cape Gon&s;alvo</HI> they pink and colour their bodies, and offer their Wives to Strangers; The King u&s;es his own Daughters when grown up as Wives, and the Queens with the like ince&s;tuous abo|mination make u&s;e of their own Sons.</P>
<P>Their Women (&s;aith my Author) are un|faithful Di&s;coverers of Natures mo&s;t hidden &s;e|crets, not being a&s;hamed to be delivered pub|lickly in the &s;ight of Men, Boys and Girls. They circumci&s;e both Sexes, after Travel they accompany not their Husbands in three months after; as &s;oon as &s;he is delivered they gave her a drink made of Rice, Mays, Water, Wine, and <HI>Mallaguette</HI> like our Pepper, after which &s;he lyes warm three or four hours, and then ri&s;es, wa&s;hes her &s;elf and Child, and &s;o falls to her work as before; Next they give it a name, u&s;ually of &s;ome Chri&s;tian they are obliged to, then wrapping it in a kind of Blanket or Skin, they lay it upon Ru&s;hes where it continues a|bout five weeks, then the Mother tyes it to a board and carries it on her back with the Legs
<PB N="8" REF="7">under her arm-pits, and the hands tyed about her neck, where it hangs all day, and never comes off till it goes to bed, and yet few or none of them prove lame or deformed, notwith|&s;tanding the &s;haking of their bodies, they give them the brea&s;t over their &s;houlders, and this may be the rea&s;on of the flatne&s;s of their No&s;es by their knocking them continually again&s;t the Back and Shoulders of the Mother while &s;he is walking or at work; for it is ob&s;erved that the Children of their Gentry who&s;e Mothers do not labour, nor carry their Infants about them, have very comely No&s;es; they wa&s;h and rub them every morning with Oil of Palms.</P>
<P>When they are &s;even or eight years old, they hang a Net about their Necks, made of the Bark of a Tree, full of <HI>Fetiches</HI> or little Gods to &s;ecure them from the Devil, who they believe would el&s;e carry them away; They hang their Hair full of Shells, and Coral, about the Arms and Legs, with &s;everal <HI>Feticho's</HI> of different qualities, one being an Antidote again&s;t Vomit|ing, a &s;econd again&s;t dangerous Falls, a third prevents Bleeding, a fourth cau&s;es Sleep, a fifth &s;ecures them again&s;t Wild Bea&s;ts, and the like, giving to each <HI>Feti&s;&s;o</HI> a different name: They &s;oon learn to &s;peak, go, and &s;wim: When they are born, they are not black, but red: About &s;even year old they learn them to &s;pin Thred, make Nets, and go a Fi&s;hing with their Fathers, and feed as they do, picking up any na&s;ty
<PB N="9" REF="7">thing in the Streets, which they eat with good Appetites: The Boys and Girls are all naked together, which makes them have no &s;en&s;e of &s;hame or mode&s;ty, they being neither reproved nor corrected by their Parents: They are ex|cellent at Swimming, even at this Age, &s;o that if their Canoe over&s;et at Sea, they are very little concerned, all of them &s;wimming back again to the place from whence they came, and con&s;equently they can Dive with great dexterity and fetch up any thing from the bottom: About twelve their Fathers in&s;truct them how to make a Canoe, and catch Fi&s;h; The Merchants bring their Sons acquainted with <HI>Europeans,</HI> and with the My&s;tery of Trade: At eighteen they begin to &s;et up for them&s;elves, two or three together hiring a Hou&s;e and purcha&s;ing a Canoe; they then cover their Nudities, grow amorous, and their Fathers look out Wives for them: The Girls clean the Hou&s;es, pick the Rice, beat the Mays, make the Bread, clean the Kitchen, buy and &s;ell at Market, make Baskets of Ru&s;hes and Matts which they weave extream curiou&s;ly, but their chief care is to provide Meat and Drink for their Parents, &s;ecure their Goods, and all other kinds of good Hu&s;wifry; when grown up, they are vary la&s;civious, and boa&s;t of their Gallantries, e&s;pecially with Strangers, whom they &s;eem to affect above their own Men: They are very careful to keep their Teeth white, have Wit enough, but are very wanton
<PB N="10" REF="8">with the Young Fellows &s;tark naked, to plea&s;e whom they wa&s;h, comb, and plait their hair with great curio&s;ity, &s;ome paint their Fore|heads and Eyebrows red and white, and hang Pendants in their Ears, all love Ribbons e&s;peci|ally red, they have Necklaces of Coral, and Bracelets upon their Wri&s;ts, Arms and Legs, when they go abroad they were a piece of Silk, Taffaty or other Stuff wrapt about them from the brea&s;t to the midleg, and have always a great bunch of Keys, though never a Coffer nor Trunk to open, the Virgins make it their whole bu&s;ine&s;s to appear acceptable e&s;pecially to white men, and are &s;eldom barren be|fore, though not very fruitful after Marri|age.</P>
<P>For many years the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> frequenting the&s;e Coa&s;ts, made little benefit thereby, for the Inha|bitants grew &s;o &s;ubtil, that perceiving their Gold was &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired by all Nations, they began to know its true value, and &s;et &s;uch a rate thereon, that having been formerly often beguiled by others, they grew more wary and circum&s;pect in their bargaining, and to look more narrowly to the mea&s;ure and goodne&s;s of their Commodities, and though at fir&s;t they knew no di&s;tinction of Chri&s;tians, but thought the <HI>Portugals,</HI> and all other white men to be of the &s;ame Nation, yet they have &s;ince learn|ed the particular manners and dealing of each Countrey, and have found the faire&s;t and &s;qua|re&s;t
<PB N="11" REF="8">Trade from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who are therefore mo&s;t welcome to them, and &s;peed be&s;t of any other Nation what&s;oever; E&s;pecially &s;ince his late Maje&s;ties happy Re&s;tauration, by who&s;e gracious favour the Traders into the&s;e parts were Incorporated, and by their Charter dated <HI>Jan.</HI> 20. 1662. are intituled, <HI>the Company of Royal Adventurers</HI> of <HI>England</HI> Trading into <HI>Africa,</HI> or the <HI>Guinea Company;</HI> The Limits of their Trade, being from <HI>Sally</HI> in South <HI>Bar|bary,</HI> to <HI>Cape de bona E&s;peranza,</HI> or the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> within which Limits all <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships are prohibited to Trade unle&s;s Authorized by them.

<PB N="12" REF="9">their Merchandize and Commerce in <HI>Africa,</HI> for the names of &s;ome of which I mu&s;t be ob|liged to a Gentleman, who has lately travelled thither, of which I &s;hall give a brief account, and touch upon the manners of the Natives and other ob&s;ervables as I pa&s;s along.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t place he mentions is <HI>Gambo,</HI> where the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have a Fort, with eight pieces of Cannon, and the Government worth about two Thou&s;and Pound a year; It is Scituate near <HI>Cape Verde,</HI> &s;o called from its continual greenne&s;s, which makes it a mo&s;t delectable place, being a Promontory, which throws it &s;elf into the Sea, covered with green Trees, and cau&s;ing a very beautiful Pro&s;pect by rea&s;on of their evenne&s;s, &s;eeming as if planted by a line; we have already de&s;cribed the Natives, only may add, that they have generally &s;mall Bellies, long Legs, broad Feet, long Toes, &s;harp Sight, quick Wits, are Envious, curi|ou&s;ly Neat, Thieves, Letcherous, &s;ubject to the Pox, of which as well as their <HI>Pudenda</HI> they are not the lea&s;t a&s;hamed, yet hold break|ing wind backward a great incivility, and wondred at the <HI>Hollanders</HI> for offering them &s;uch contempt; La&s;tly, they have Stomachs like E&s;tridges, as appears by their &s;trange and u&s;ual repa&s;ts, of which I &s;hall next give an ac|count.</P>
<P>When they go to Market, they wa&s;h from Head to Foot, and put on other Cloths; They
<PB N="13" REF="9">buy only for one day; Their Bread is made by &s;tamping their Millet as we do Spice in a woodden di&s;h, &s;teeping it over night with a lit|tle Maiz, and in the morning laying it on a &s;tone, they grind it with another &s;tone, as Painters do their Colours, till it be dough, which they then temper with fre&s;h Water and Salt, and make Rolls thereof twice &s;o big as a mans Fi&s;t, baking them a little on the Hearth, and then eat it; Their Viands are raw fle&s;h, hand|fuls of Corn, large draughts of <HI>Aqua Vitae,</HI> Dogs, Catts, Buffles, Elephants, though &s;tinking like Carrion, and a thou&s;and Magots crawling on them; They have little Birds like Bullfinches which hang their Ne&s;ts on the &s;mall ends of branches of Trees for fear of Snakes, the&s;e they eat alive Feathers and all; The <HI>Ne|gro</HI>'s &s;ay that up in the Countrey, they eat dri|ed Snakes, and the guts of Dogs raw, which our Author hath &s;een, and a Boy who was left on Ship-board in pawn for Money, would pri|vately kill the Hens, that he might eat the raw Guts; They likewi&s;e eat raw &s;tinking Fi&s;h dried in the Sun, yet can di&s;pence with dain|ties when they have them; They make a kind of Ale of Mays and Water boyl'd together, and putting it into a Ve&s;&s;el as large as a Kilder|kin, four or five place them&s;elves round, and drink it off, each &s;ending a little Pot full to his be&s;t beloved Wife; They lay their hands upon the Head of him that drinks, and cry aloud
<PB N="14" REF="10"><HI>Tauto&s;i, Tauto&s;i;</HI> He mu&s;t not drink off all, but leaves a little to throw on the ground to his <HI>Feti&s;&s;o,</HI> &s;aying <HI>I, ou,</HI> &s;pouting out &s;ome on the Arms and Legs of their <HI>Feti&s;&s;o's,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing that otherwi&s;e they &s;hould not drink in quiet; They are great drinkers, and feed as unmannerly as Swine, &s;itting on the ground, and cramming it in, not &s;wallowing one Mor&s;el after another, but tear their meat to pieces, and throw it in|to their Mouths, which &s;tand gaping to re|ceive it, they are always hungry, and would eat all day long; Yea the <HI>Europeans</HI> have great Appetites while they are there; He that gets mo&s;t, drinks mo&s;t of their &s;trong Liquors, for they lay up but little.</P>
<P>The next place belonging to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> on the&s;e Coa&s;ts is in the River of <HI>Sierra Leona,</HI> where our Author &s;ays, an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> dwelt a long time in one of the I&s;les, having a fair Hou&s;e, guarded with four pieces of Cannon, and was well beloved and protected by the Kings of that Countrey. In the fir&s;t War with <HI>Holland</HI> 1666. our Author being aboard a <HI>Dutch</HI> Man of War, this <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factor writ to them divers times to de&s;ire he might come and Trade with them, they told him he might do it with &s;afety, and upon their Parole, the <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> called <HI>Abraham</HI> came aboard them in his Shallop, rowed by three Slaves, accompanied by a <HI>Hollander</HI> and two others which belonged to him, and was kindly treat|ed,

<P>Being about to land, they di&s;covered 200 <HI>Moores</HI> got together about the Hou&s;e with Firelocks, and a greater number farther up in the Woods, which obliged the <HI>Hollanders</HI> to make a &s;how of going up higher, as being weaker, and therefore had more occa&s;ion for the wind, but the <HI>Negroes</HI> thought they had been gone to <HI>Bowre,</HI> and di&s;patch a Canoe to give the King of <HI>Boulom</HI> the Alarum, which was per&s;ued by the Enemy, who fired into their Boat, and at length took them, they were two young Slaves belonging to the <HI>Portugals,</HI> who lived with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factor, but would confe&s;s nothing of their Me&s;&s;age; The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the Hou&s;e ob&s;erving what pa&s;&s;ed, fired at them with their Cannon, and three of their Bullets fell within ten paces of the Boat; The

<P>The Tyde coming in, the <HI>Dutch</HI> retreated to their Ship, wherein they found &s;everal <HI>Moores</HI> and <HI>Portugals,</HI> and among them the King of <HI>Bouloms</HI> Son called <HI>Bembo,</HI> about 35 years old, well proportioned, and abating his Blackne&s;s, a very hand&s;om Man, he was a very great Friend of <HI>Abrahams</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factor, and when he under&s;tood he was a Pri&s;oner, he in&s;tantly in|terceded for his Ran&s;om, and on <HI>Monday</HI> noon came on board again with an hundred Ele|phants Teeth, weighing nine hundred pound weight, and two Civet Catts alive, upon the delivery whereof <HI>Abraham</HI> was di&s;mi&s;t, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> giving him a little Barrel of Strong-Waters, a Roll of Tobacco, a Chee&s;e and a Salvo of three Guns.</P>

<P>The&s;e Countries produce variety of Creatures, and among others Tygers and Leopards, who bear great enmity to each other, though gene|rally the Tyger is the Conquerour, therefore when the Leopard is pur&s;ued by the Tyger, he with his Tail wipes out his foot&s;teps that &s;o he may not be traced. Some of the Ancients knowing the fiercene&s;s of the Tyger, attributed to him the command of the Woods, but in the&s;e Parts, becau&s;e he hurts no man but only Bea&s;ts, they make the Leopard King of the Forre&s;t, for which ravening temper they are hunted and killed by all Men, even for their own &s;afety.

The <HI>Blacks</HI> affirm it is of Humane Race, but by the alteration and change of the Woods and Wilderne&s;s it is become half a Bea&s;t, they &s;u&s;tain them&s;elves in the Woods with Fruit and wild Honey, which they get out of the Trees, and as they are numerous, &s;o upon meeting, they fight continually with each other.

The Camels in <HI>Africk</HI> are more hardy than in other places, and will not only carry great burthens, but travel fifty days to|gether without any Corn, only turn them out at night to feed on Thi&s;tles, Boughs, and the like, and no le&s;s patient are they of Thir&s;t, be|ing able to endure fifteen days without Drink. The Lions in cold places are gentler, in hotter more fierce, and will not flie the approach of two hundred Armed Hor&s;emen; in time of their coupling eight or ten will follow one Female, with terrible and bloody Battels among them|&s;elves: They report that Lions &s;pare tho&s;e who

The like is reported by <HI>Gellius</HI> of a Fugitive Servant, who having performed the &s;ame kind Office to a Lion, was by him gratified for a long time by giving him a daily portion of his Prey: It happened that afterward this Man was taken, and pre&s;ented to his Ma&s;ter a <HI>Roman</HI> Senator, who exhibited Games to the People, wherein Slaves and condemned Per&s;ons were expo&s;ed to the fury of Bea&s;ts, among whom he put this Servant, and by a wonderful fate this Lion was &s;oon after taken, and brought to execute the&s;e horrid Spectacles.

<P>The <HI>Hyaena</HI> is another &s;trange Bea&s;t which &s;ome have thought to be Male one year, and Female another, it hath no Joint in the Neck, and therefore &s;tirs not his Head, but the whole Body at once; He is &s;aid to imitate the Voice of Men, and drawing near the Sheepfolds, ha|ving heard the name of &s;ome of the Shepherds, will call him, and when he comes devour him: They &s;ay his Eyes are of various Colours, and that his &s;hadow prevents the barking of a Dog: By ingendring with this Bea&s;t, the Lione&s;s brings forth a <HI>Corcuta</HI> of like qualities with the <HI>Hyaena,</HI> he hath one continued Tooth without divi&s;ion throughout his Mouth. The <HI>Lybard</HI> is not hurtful to Men except they di&s;turb him. The <HI>Dabu</HI> is &s;aid to be a fooli&s;h Creature, in &s;hape like a Wolf, only his Legs and Feet are like a Mans; they that know his haunts, &s;ing and fiddle before his Den, his Ears being &s;o capti|vated with the Mu&s;ick, that he is not aware his

<P>The Rivers breed Water-Elephants, about the bigne&s;s of a large Hor&s;e, but much thicker and rounder, &s;eeming as if they were blown up; Likewi&s;e Sea-Cats, and many other mon&s;trous Creatures. There are variety of Fowls of di|vers kinds, as Eagles, Parrots, Cranes, and ma|ny more, and among others a Bird no bigger than a Thru&s;h, by who&s;e chirping they gue&s;s at their good or ill Fortune in their Journey. <HI>Crocodiles</HI> are here &s;o large, that they will &s;wal|low an Ox whole; but above all things the mon&s;trous Serpents produced in the&s;e Countreys are remarkable, among which the mo&s;t poi&s;on|ous are of a Gra&s;s green: Some are &s;o curiou&s;ly &s;potted with lively Colours as are &s;carce to be found in any other Creatures. The King of <HI>Bena,</HI> whom the Inhabitants call <HI>King of Ser|pents,</HI> keeps commonly one of them in his Arms, which he &s;trokes and fo&s;ters as it were a young Child, and &s;o highly e&s;teems, that none dare hurt or kill it.

<P>Ju&s;t by the Sea-&s;ide as he was about to lanch his floating &s;tick, he e&s;pied a great <HI>Alligator,</HI> which will devour a man at a mouthful, this altered his mind, re&s;olving rather to live with Infidels, than to be acce&s;&s;ary to his own death; But the next day it plea&s;ed God to move the Kings Heart to let him go, &s;ending him in a Canoe placed between a <HI>Negro</HI>'s Legs, with &s;ome others to guide this &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el for fear he &s;hould leap over-board, and &s;wim to the Ship. At a di&s;tance he haled her in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> to the great &s;urprizal of tho&s;e within her, the <HI>Negro</HI>'s gave him leave to &s;tand up and &s;how him&s;elf to the Captain, to whom he gave an Account, how four were left there, and he only remained alive. It was &s;ome time before they bargained, though the Captain was re|&s;olved not to leave him behind. Several times the <HI>Negro</HI>'s padled away with their Canoe, re&s;olving not to part with him, but what with his intreaties and promi&s;es, he per&s;waded them to the Ship again, and at la&s;t they delivered him on board for forty five Copper and Iron Bars about the bigne&s;s of a mans Finger; When he came on board, his Hair was very long, and
<PB N="71" REF="39">his Skin tawny like a Mulatto, having gone na|ked all the time he was there, and u&s;ually anoin|ted him&s;elf with Palm-Oyl, the Seamen very charitably apparalel'd him, and in &s;hort time after he arrived &s;afely in <HI>England</HI> with a thick|ful Heart for &s;o happy a deliverance.

It lies in &s;ixteen degrees, and fifteen minutes of South Latitude in the main Ocean, about fif|teen hundred Miles from the <HI>Cape of Good Hope,</HI> three hundred and fifty from <HI>Angola,</HI> and five hundred and ten from <HI>Bra&s;ile,</HI> the circumfe|rence is about &s;even miles, lying high out of the Water, and &s;urrounded on the Sea-coa&s;ts with &s;teep Rocks, having within many Cliffs, Mountains and Valleys, of which one is nam|ed <HI>Church-Valley,</HI> where behind a &s;mall Church they climb up to the Mountains. To the South is <HI>Apple-Dale,</HI> &s;o called from the abundance of Oranges, Lemons and Pomegranats enough to furni&s;h five or &s;ix Ships. On the We&s;t &s;ide of the Church, Ships have good Anchorage clo&s;e under the Shore, to prevent the Winds which blow fiercely from the adjacent high Mountains.</P>
<P>The Air &s;eems very temperate and healthful, in&s;omuch that &s;ick men brought a&s;hore there, in a &s;hort time recover; Yet the heat in the Valleys is as intollerable as the eager cold upon the Mountains; It commonly rains there five or &s;ix times a day, &s;o that the barene&s;s of the Hills is not occa&s;ioned for want of Water, of
<PB N="73" REF="40">which it hath two or three good Springs be|&s;ide, for furni&s;hing Ships with fre&s;h Water; The ground of its own accord brings forth wild Pea&s;e and Beans, al&s;o whole Woods of Orange, Lemon, and Pomegranat Trees all the year long laden both with Blo&s;&s;oms and Fruit, good Figs, abundance of Ebony and Ro&s;e-trees, Par&s;ly, Mu&s;tard-&s;eed, Pur&s;lain, Sorrel, and the like; The Woods and Moun|tains are full of Goats, very large Rams, and wild Swine, but difficult to be taken. When the <HI>Portugue&s;s</HI> fir&s;t di&s;covered it, they found neither four-footed Bea&s;ts nor Fruit-trees, but only fre&s;h Water; They afterward planted Fruit-trees, which &s;o increa&s;ed &s;ince, that at pre&s;ent all the Valleys &s;tand full of them; Par|tridges, Pigeons, Moor-hens, and Peacocks breed here very numerou&s;ly, whereof a good Mark&s;man may &s;oon provide a Dinner for his Friends. On the Cliff-I&s;lands, on the South are thou&s;ands of grey and black Mews, or Sea-Pies, and al&s;o white and coloured Birds, &s;ome with long, others with &s;hort Necks, who lay their Eggs on the Rocks, and are &s;o unaccu&s;|tomed to fear, that they &s;uffer them&s;elves to be taken with the Hand, and gaze at their &s;urpri|zers, till they are knocked on the Head with &s;ticks.</P>
<P>From the Salt-Water beating again&s;t the Cliffs a Froth or Scum remains in &s;ome places, which the heat of the Sun &s;o purifies, that it
<PB N="74" REF="41">becomes white and good Salt; &s;ome of the Mountains yield Bole Armoniack, and a fat Earth like <HI>Terra Lemnia.</HI> The Sea will an|&s;wer the pains of a patient Fi&s;herman, who mu&s;t u&s;e an Angle, not a Net, becau&s;e of the foul ground and beating of the waves, the chief are Mackrel, Roach, Carp, but differing in colour from tho&s;e among us; Eels as big as a mans Arm, and well ta&s;ted Crabs, Lob&s;ters, Oy&s;ters and Mu&s;&s;els as good as <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>It is in this I&s;land that the Scene of that no|table fancy, called. <HI>The Man in the Moon, or a di&s;cour&s;e of a Voyage thither,</HI> by <HI>Domingo Gon|&s;ales</HI> is lay'd, written by a late Reverend and Learned Bi&s;hop, &s;aith the Excellent and inge|nious Bi&s;hop <HI>Wilkins,</HI> who calls it a plea|&s;ant and well contrived fancy, in his own Book intituled, <HI>A Di&s;cour&s;e of the New World, tend|ing to prove that it is po&s;&s;ible there may be another habitable World in the Moon;</HI> Wherein among many other curious arguments he affirms, that this hath been the direct opinion of divers an|cient, and &s;ome Modern Mathematicians, and may probably be deduced from the Tenents of others, neither does it contradict any princi|ple of rea&s;on nor Faith; And that as their World is our Moon, &s;o our World is theirs.</P>
<P>Now this &s;mall Tract having &s;o worthy a Per&s;on to vouch for the credit of it, and many of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hi&s;torians having publi&s;hed for Truth, what is altogether as improbable
<PB N="75" REF="41">as this, as Sr. <HI>John Mandevil</HI> in his Travels and others, and this having what they are ut|terly de&s;titute of, that is Invention mixed with Judgment, and was judged worthy to be Li|cen&s;ed 50 years ago, and not &s;ince reprinted, whereby it would be utterly lo&s;t. I have not thought it ami&s;s to republi&s;h the Sub&s;tance thereof, wherein the Author &s;ays he does not de&s;ign to di&s;cour&s;e his Readers into a belief of each particular circum&s;tance, but expects that his new di&s;covery of a <HI>New World</HI> may find little better entertainment than <HI>Columbus</HI> had in his fir&s;t di&s;covery of <HI>America,</HI> though yet that poor e&s;pial betrayed &s;o much knowledge as hath &s;ince increa&s;t to va&s;t Improvements, and the then <HI>Unknown</HI> is now found to be of as large extent as all the other <HI>known World;</HI> That there &s;hould be <HI>Antipodes</HI> was once thought as great a Paradox as now that the Moon &s;hould be habitable.

<PB N="69" REF="42">
<P>It is &s;ufficiently known to all the Countries of <HI>Audaluzia,</HI> that I <HI>Domingo Gon&s;ales</HI> was born of a Noble Family in the renowned City of <HI>Sevil</HI> in 1552. my Fathers name being <HI>Therando Gon&s;ales</HI> near kin&s;man on the Mo|thers &s;ide to <HI>Don Pedro Sanches</HI> the worthy Count of <HI>Almenara,</HI> My Mother was the Daughter of the Reverend and famous Law|yer <HI>Otho Perez de Sallaveda</HI> Governour of <HI>Barcellona,</HI> and <HI>Corrigidor</HI> of <HI>Bi&s;cay;</HI> I being the younge&s;t of &s;eventeen Children they had, was put to School, and de&s;igned by them to the Church; But Heaven purpo&s;ing to u&s;e my Service in matters of far another Nature and quality, in&s;pired me with &s;pending &s;ome time in the Wars; It was at the time that <HI>Don Ferrands,</HI> the Noble and thrice renowned Duke D' <HI>Alva</HI> was &s;ent into the Low Coun|treys in 1568. I then following the current of my de&s;ire leaving the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Salamanca,</HI> whither my Parents had &s;ent me, without giving notice to any of my deare&s;t Friends, got through <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> where in <HI>June</HI> 1569 I arrived but in a mean condition, for having &s;old my Books, Bedding and other things which yielded me about 30 Duck|ets, and borrowed twenty more of my Fa|thers Friends, I bought a little Nag, where|with I travelled more thriftily than u&s;ually young Gentlemen do, till arriving within a League of <HI>Antwerp,</HI> &s;ome of the cur&s;ed <HI>Ge&s;es</HI>
<PB N="77" REF="42">&s;et upon me, and bereaved me of my Hor&s;e Money, and all, whereupon I was forc' through want and nece&s;&s;ity to enter into the Service of Mar&s;hal <HI>Co&s;&s;ey</HI> a <HI>French</HI> Nobleman, whom I &s;erved truly in a very honourable im|ploy, though mine Enemies to my di&s;grace, affirm I was his Hor&s;e-keepers Boy; But fot that matter, I refer my &s;elf to Count <HI>Man&s;|field,</HI> Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tavier,</HI> and other Per&s;ons of Quality and condition, who have often te&s;tifi|ed to many worthy men now living, the very truth of the bu&s;ine&s;s, which indeed was this, Mon&s;ieur <HI>Co&s;&s;ey</HI> being about this time &s;ent Am|ba&s;&s;ador to the Duke <HI>D' Alva</HI> Governour of the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> he under&s;tanding the No|bility of my Birth, and my late misfortune, judging it would be no &s;mall honour to him to have a <HI>Spaniard</HI> of that Quality about him, furni&s;hed me with a Hor&s;e, Armour, and what|ever I wanted, u&s;ing my Service in nothing &s;o much, after I had learned <HI>French,</HI> as wri|ting his Letters, becau&s;e my Hand was then very fair. In time of War if upon nece&s;&s;ity, I &s;ometime dre&s;&s;ed my own Hor&s;e, I ought not to be reproacht therewith, &s;ince I count it the part of a Gentleman to &s;ubmit to the vile&s;t Office for the Service of his Prince.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t expedition I was in, was when the Mar&s;hal my Friend met the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> making a Road into <HI>France,</HI> and forced him to fly even to the Walls of <HI>Cambray;</HI> It was
<PB N="78" REF="43">my good Fortune to defeat a Trooper by kil|ling his Hor&s;e with my Pi&s;tol, who falling upon his Leg could not &s;tir, but yielded to my mercy; I knowing my own weakne&s;s of Body, and &s;eeing him a lu&s;ty tall Fellow, thought it the &s;ure&s;t way to di&s;patch him, which having done, I plundered him of a Chain, Money, and other things to the value of 200 Ducats, This Money was no &s;ooner in my Pockets, but I began to re&s;ume the remembrance of my Nobility, and taking my audience of leave from Mon&s;ieur <HI>Co&s;&s;ey,</HI> I in&s;tantly repaired to the Duke <HI>D' Alva</HI>'s Court, where divers of my Kindred &s;eeing my Pocket full of good Crowns, were ready enough to acknowledge me; By their means I was received into pay, and in time obtained a good degree of favour with the Duke, who would &s;ometimes je&s;t a little more &s;everely at my Per&s;onage than I could well bear, for though I mu&s;t acknowledge my Stature is &s;o little, as I think no man living is le&s;s, yet &s;ince it is the work of Heaven, and not my own, he ought not to have upbraided a Gentleman therewith; And tho&s;e glorious things that have happened to me may evince, that great and wonderful matters may be per|formed by very unlikely Bodies, if the mind be good, and Fortune &s;econd our endeavours;</P>
<P>Though the Dukes joques a little di&s;gu&s;ted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">e, yet I endeavoured to conceal my re&s;ent|ments, and accommodating my &s;elf to &s;ome
<PB N="79" REF="43">other of his humors, I was &s;o far intere&s;ted in his favour, that at his going into <HI>Spain</HI> in 1573. whither I attended him, by his kind|ne&s;s, and &s;ome other accidents, wherein by my Indu&s;try I was &s;eldom wanting to my &s;elf, I was able to carry home 3000 Crowns in my Pocket.</P>
<P>At my return my Parents, who were ex|treamly di&s;turbed at my departure, received me with great joy, which was increa&s;ed becau&s;e they found I had brought wherewith to main|tain my &s;elf without being chargable to them, &s;o that they need not le&s;&s;en the Portions of my Brothers and Si&s;ters to provide for me. But doubting I would &s;pend it as lightly as I got it, they continually &s;ollicited me to marry the Daughter of <HI>John Figueres</HI> a con&s;iderable Merchant of <HI>Lisbon,</HI> to which I complied, and putting my Marriage Money, and good part of my own into the hands of my Father, or &s;uch as he advi&s;ed me to, I lived in good fa&s;hi|on, and much like a Gentleman for many years very happily; At length &s;ome quarrels ari&s;ing between me and one <HI>Pedro Delgades</HI> a Gentleman and Kin&s;man of mine, the cau&s;es whereof are needle&s;s to relate, this difference grew to &s;uch a height, that when no mediati|on of Friends could prevail, we two went alone with our Swords into the Field, where it was my chance to kill him, though a &s;tout proper man, but what I wanted in &s;trength I
<PB N="80" REF="44">&s;upplied in courage, and my agility countervail|ed for his Stature. This being acted in <HI>Carmona,</HI> I fled with all &s;peed to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> thinking to conceal my &s;elf with &s;ome Friends of my Fa|ther in Law, till the bu&s;ine&s;s might be ac|commodated, and I acquitted by con&s;ent of the Pro&s;ecutors. This happened in 1596 at which time, a famous <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Count coming from the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> publi&s;hed Triumphant Declarations in Print, of a great Victory he had obtained again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> near the <HI>I&s;le of Pines,</HI> whereas in reality he got nothing at all in that Voyage but blows, and a con&s;idera|ble lo&s;s. It had been well if vanity and lying had been his only crimes; His covetou&s;ne&s;s had like to have been my utter ruin, though &s;ince it hath proved the occa&s;ion of Eternizing my name I verily believe to all Po&s;terity, and to the un&s;peakable benefit of all Mortals for ever hereafter, at lea&s;t if it plea&s;e Heaven that I return home &s;afe to my Countrey, and give perfect In&s;tructions how tho&s;e almo&s;t incre|dible and impo&s;&s;ible Acquirements may be imparted to the World. You &s;hall then &s;ee men flying in the Air from one place to ano|ther, you &s;hall then be able to &s;end Me&s;&s;ages many hundred miles in an in&s;tant, and receive an&s;wers thereto immediately, without the help of any Creature upon Earth; You &s;hall then pre&s;ently impart your mind to your Friend though in the mo&s;t remote and ob&s;cure place
<PB N="81" REF="44">of a populous City, and a multitude of other notable Experiments; But what exceeds all, you &s;hall then have the di&s;covery of a <HI>New World,</HI> and abundance of rare and incredible &s;ecrets of Nature, which the Philo&s;ophers of former Ages never &s;o much as dreamt of; But I mu&s;t be cautious in publi&s;hing the&s;e wonder|ful my&s;teries, till our State&s;men have con&s;ider|ed how they may con&s;i&s;t with the Policy and good Government of our Countrey, and like|wi&s;e, whether the Fathers of the Church may not judge the divulging them prejudicial to the Affairs of the Catholick Faith and Religi|on, which (by tho&s;e wonders I have &s;een above any mortal man before me) I am in|&s;tructed to advance with my utmo&s;t endea|vours, without re&s;pect to any temporal advan|tage what&s;oever.</P>
<P>But to proceed with my Narrative, this huffing Captain aforenamed, pretended much di&s;content for the death of the &s;aid <HI>Delgades,</HI> who was indeed &s;ome Kin to him, however he was willing to be quiet if I would have given him a thou&s;and Duckets; I had now, be&s;ides a Wife, two Sons, whom I was not willing to begger, only to &s;atisfie the avaritious humour of this Boa&s;ter, and was therefore ne|ce&s;&s;itated to take &s;ome other cour&s;e; I imbarkt in a &s;tout Carrick bound for the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> carrying the value of two thou&s;and Duckets to Trade with, leaving as much more for the
<PB N="82" REF="45">&s;upport of my Wife and Children behind me, whatever misfortune might happen to me; In the <HI>Indies</HI> I thrived exceedingly, laying out my Stock in Diamonds, Emeralds and Pearls, which I bought at &s;uch ea&s;y rates, that my Stock &s;afely arriving in <HI>Spain</HI> (as I under&s;tood it did) mu&s;t needs yield ten for one. But for my &s;elf having doubled <HI>Cape buona E&s;peranca</HI> in my way home, I fell dangerou&s;ly &s;ick, expect|ing nothing but death, which had then un|doubtedly happened, but that we ju&s;t then recovered the Ble&s;&s;ed I&s;le of St. <HI>Hellens,</HI> the only Paradice I believe on Earth, for healthful|ne&s;s of Air, and fruitfulne&s;s of Soil, producing all nece&s;&s;aries for the Life of man; It is about three Leagues in compa&s;s, and has no firm Land or Continent within 300 Leagues, nay not &s;o much as an I&s;land within an hundred Leagues of it, &s;o that it may &s;eem a Miracle of Nature, that out of &s;o va&s;t and tempe&s;tu|ous an Ocean, &s;uch a &s;mall Rock or piece of ground &s;hould ari&s;e and di&s;cover it &s;elf. On the South is a good Harbour, and near it di|vers &s;mall Hou&s;es built by the <HI>Portugue&s;s</HI> to accommodate Strangers, with a pretty Chap|pel hand&s;omely beautified with a Tower, and a fair Bell therein. Near it is a Stream of ex|cellent fre&s;h water, divers hand&s;ome walks planted on both &s;ides with Orange, Lemmod, Pomegranate, Almond-trees and the like, which are Fruit all the year, as do al&s;o divers others;
<PB N="83" REF="45">There are &s;tore of Garden Herbs, with Wheat, Pea&s;e, Barley, and mo&s;t kinds of Pul&s;e, but it chiefly aboundeth with Cattel and Fowl, as Goats, Swine, Sheep, Partridges, wild Hens, Phea&s;ants, Pigeons, and wild Fowl beyond credit; But e&s;pecially about <HI>February</HI> and <HI>March</HI> are to be &s;een huge Flocks of a kind of <HI>Wild Swans,</HI> (whereof I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak more hereafter) who like our Cuckoes and Nightingales, go away at a certain Sea&s;on, and are no more &s;een that year.</P>
<P>On this happy I&s;land did they &s;et me a&s;hore with a <HI>Negro</HI> to attend me, where prai&s;ed be Heaven, I recovered my health, and continued there a whole year, &s;olacing my &s;elf for want of Humane Society with Birds and bruit Bea&s;ts; <HI>Diego</HI> my Black-moor was forced to live in a Cave at the We&s;t-end of the I&s;le, for had we dwelt together, Victuals would not have been &s;o plenty with us; But now if one &s;ucceeded well in Hunting or Fowling, the other would find means to invite and treat him, and if both mi&s;t, we were then fain to look out &s;harply, but this very &s;eldom happened, &s;ince no Crea|ture there fears a man more than they do a Goat or Cow, whereby I ea&s;ily tamed divers kinds of Birds and Bea&s;ts in a &s;hort time by only muzling them, &s;o that till they came either to me or <HI>Diego</HI> they could not &s;eed; At fir&s;t I much delighted in a kind of Patridges, and a tame Fax, whereof I made good u&s;e; For if
<PB N="84" REF="46">I had occa&s;ion to confer with <HI>Diego,</HI> I would take one of them muzled and hungry, and ty|ing a note about his Neck, beat him from me, whereupon he would &s;treight away to <HI>Diego's</HI> Cave, and if he were not there, would beat about till they found him, yet this conveyance being not without &s;ome inconvenience need|le&s;s to be mentioned, after a while I per&s;wad|ed <HI>Diego,</HI> (who though a Fellow of good Parts, was content to be ruled by me) to re|move to a Promontory or Cape on the north-we&s;t part of the I&s;land, being though a League off, yet within &s;ight of my Hou&s;e and Chappel, and then when the weather was fair, we could at all times by &s;ignals declare our minds each to other in an in&s;tant either by Night or Day, wherein we took much plea&s;ure. If in the Night I would &s;ignifie any thing to him, I u&s;ed to &s;et up a light in the Bell Tower, which was a pretty large Room with a fair Window well gla&s;ed, and the Walls within being plai&s;tered were exceeding white, by rea&s;on whereof, though the light were but &s;mall, it made a great &s;how, and would have done much farther off, if there had been need. Af|ter this light had &s;tood half an hour I covered it, and then if I &s;aw any &s;ignal of light again from my Companion at the Cape, I knew he waited for my notice, and &s;o by hiding and &s;hewing my light according to a certain Rule or Agreement betwixt us, I certified him of
<PB N="85" REF="46">what I plea&s;ed. In the day I adverti&s;ed him by Smoke, Du&s;t, and &s;ometimes by a more refined and effactual way. This Art contains many My&s;teries, and may be very u&s;eful if well im|ployed.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding after a while I grew weary of it as too painful, and again u&s;ed my Winged Me&s;&s;engers; Upon the Shoar, e&s;pe|cially about the Mouth of our River, I found great &s;tore of a certain kind of <HI>Wild Swans</HI> aforementioned, feeding u&s;ually upon prey, and that both of Fi&s;h and Birds, and which is more &s;trange having one Claw like an Eagle, and the other like a Swan, The&s;e Birds com|monly breeding here in infinite numbers, I took thirty or forty of them young, and bred them up by hand for recreation, yet not with|out &s;ome thoughts of that Experiment which I after put in practice. The&s;e being &s;trong and able to continue a great flight, I taught them fir&s;t to come at call afar off, not u&s;ing any noi&s;e, but only &s;hewing them a White Cloth, and here I found it true what <HI>Plutarch</HI> affirms, <HI>That Creatures which eat Fle&s;h are more deci|ble than others.</HI> 'Tis wonderful to think what Tricks I taught them ere they were a quar|ter old, among&s;t others I u&s;ed them by degrees to fly with Burdens, wherein I found them able beyond belief, and brought them &s;o forward, that a White Sheet being di&s;played to them by <HI>Diego</HI> upon the &s;ide of a Hill, they would car|ry
<PB N="86" REF="47">from me to him Bread, Fle&s;h, or whatever I plea&s;ed, and upon the like call come to me a|gain. Having proceeded thus far, I began to con&s;ult how I might join a number of them to|gether, &s;o as to carry a heavier weight, which if I could compa&s;s, I might thereby ena|ble a man to fly and be carried &s;afely in the Air from one place to another. I puzled my Wits extreamly with this thought, and upon Trial found that if many were put to the bear|ing of one great Burthen, by rea&s;on it was im|po&s;&s;ible all of them &s;hould ri&s;e together ju&s;t at one in&s;tant, the fir&s;t that rai&s;ed him&s;elf upon his Wings finding him&s;elf &s;tayed by a weight heavier than he could move or &s;tir, would &s;oon give over, and &s;o the &s;econd, third, and all the re&s;t. I contrived at la&s;t a way whereby each might ri&s;e with only his own proportion of weight, I fa&s;tned about each <HI>Gan&s;a</HI> a little Pul|ley of <HI>Cork,</HI> and putting a &s;tring of a ju&s;t length through it, I fa&s;tened one end to a block of almo&s;t eight pound weight, and tyed a two pound weight to the other end of the String, and then cau&s;ing the &s;ignal to be E|rected, they pre&s;ently all ro&s;e together, being four in number, and carried away my Block to the place appointed. This hitting &s;o luckily, I added two or three Birds more, and made Tryal of their carrying a Lamb, who&s;e hap|pine&s;s I much envied that he &s;hould be the fir&s;t living creature to partake of &s;uch an excellent device.</P>

Every hour I had a longing de&s;ire for the coming of the <HI>Indian</HI> Fleet to take me home with them, but they &s;tay'd, by what mi&s;chance I know not, three Months beyond their u&s;ual time; At length they arrived being three Carricks much weather-beaten, the men generally exceeding Sick and Weak, and were therefore con|&s;train'd to refre&s;h them&s;elves in our I&s;land a whole Month; The Admiral was called <HI>Al|phon&s;o de Xima,</HI> a Vallant Wi&s;e Man, de&s;i|rous of Glory, and worthy better Fortune than afterward befell him; To him I di&s;covered my device of the <HI>Gan&s;a's,</HI> being &s;atisfied, that it was ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible otherwi&s;e to per|&s;wade him to take &s;o many Birds into his Ship, who for the nicene&s;s of their provi&s;ion, would be more trouble&s;om than &s;o many men; Yet I adjured him by all manner of Oaths and Per&s;wa&s;ions to deal ingeniou&s;ly with me, and to be &s;ecret in the bu&s;ine&s;s, though of the la&s;t I did not much doubt, a&s;&s;uring my &s;elf he dur&s;t not impart the Experiment to any before our King were acquainted therewith. Of the fir&s;t I had more apprehen&s;ion, le&s;t Ambition and the de&s;ire of gaining to him&s;elf the honour of &s;o admirable an Invention, &s;hould tempt him to di&s;patch me. However I was forc't to run the Ri&s;que of it unle&s;s I would adventure the lo&s;s of my Birds, the like whereof for my pur|po&s;e were not to be had in Chri&s;tendom, nor
<PB N="89" REF="49">was I &s;ure ever to bring others to &s;erve my turn.</P>
<P>It happened all the&s;e doubts were cau&s;le&s;s, the man I believe was hone&s;t, yet if he had de&s;igned otherwi&s;e, I lay'd a Plot to di&s;cover him, but the misfortune we met with pre|vented all the&s;e thoughts, <HI>Thur&s;day June</HI> 21. 1599. we &s;et Sail for <HI>Spain,</HI> I having allow|ed me a very convenient Cabbin for my Birds, and Room for my Engine, which the Captain would have per&s;waded me to have le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">t behind me, and it was a wonder I did not, but my good fortune therein &s;aved my life, for after two Months Sail it happened we met with an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet about 10 Leagues from the I&s;land of <HI>Teneriff,</HI> one of the <HI>Canaries</HI> famous throughout the World for a Hill therein cal|led <HI>Pico,</HI> which is kenned at Sea above an hun|dred Leagues off. We had aboard five times their number of men, all in good health, and were well provided with Ammunition, yet finding them re&s;olved to fight, and knowing what infinite riches we carried, concluded it better if po&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape, than by encoun|tring a crew of de&s;perate Fellows, to hazard not only our own Lives, which a man of courage in this ca&s;e does not value, but the E&s;tates of many poor Merchants, who I am afraid were un|done by the mi&s;carriage of this bu&s;ine&s;s. Our Fleet con&s;i&s;ted of five Sail, that is, three Carricks, a Bark, and a Caravel, who coming from
<PB N="90" REF="50">St. <HI>Thomas I&s;le,</HI> had in an ill hour overtaken us &s;ome few days before. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> had three Ships well provided, who no &s;ooner &s;pied but pre&s;ently ingaged us, and changing their cour&s;e, endeavoured to bring us under their Lee, which they might ea&s;ily do as the Wind then &s;tood, they being light nimble Ve&s;&s;els, as <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Ships generally are, ours heavy, deep laden, and foul with the Sea. Our Captain therefore re&s;olved, wi&s;ely enough it may be, but neither valiantly nor fortunately, to fly, command|ing us to di&s;per&s;e our &s;elves. The Caravel by too much ha&s;t fell upon one of the Carricks and brui&s;ed her &s;o, that one of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who undertook her ea&s;ily fetcht her up and entred her, the Caravel &s;inking immediately before our eyes. The Bark for ought I could perceive e&s;caped unpur&s;ued, and another of our Carricks after &s;ome cha&s;e was given over by the Ene|my, who expecting a &s;ufficient Booty of us, and getting us between them, fell upon us with much fury, our Captain hereupon gave di|rection to run a&s;hoar upon <HI>Tenariff,</HI> the Port whereof we could not recover, &s;aying, <HI>That he hoped to &s;ave part of the Goods, and &s;ome of our Lives, and he had rather the re&s;t &s;hould be lo&s;t, than all fall into the mercy of our foes.</HI></P>
<P>When I heard this Re&s;olution, ob&s;erving the Sea to work high, and knowing all the Coa&s;t to be &s;o full of Rocks and Shoals, that it was impo&s;&s;ible our Ship &s;hould come near the
<PB N="91" REF="50">Land unle&s;s broken into a thou&s;and pieces, I repre&s;ented to the Captain the de&s;peratene&s;s of the attempt, wi&s;hing him rather to try the kindne&s;s of the Enemy, than throw away him|&s;elf and &s;o many brave men; But he would by no Remon&s;trances be removed in the lea&s;t from his Re&s;olution, therefore finding it high time to &s;hift for my &s;elf, I lockt up my little Casket of Jewels, which putting into my &s;leeve, I then betook me to my <HI>Gan&s;a</HI>'s, and having harna&s;|&s;ed them to my Engine, and put my &s;elf there|on, &s;uppo&s;ing, as indeed it happened, that when the Ship &s;hould &s;plit, my Birds though they wanted their &s;ignal, yet for &s;aving their own lives, which nature hath taught all Crea|tures to pre&s;erve to the utmo&s;t, would make toward Land, which fell out, thanks be to Heaven, according to my expectation; The People in the Ship wondred what I was doing, none being acquainted with the u&s;e of my Birds but the Captain, <HI>Diego</HI> being in the other Ship which fled away unpur&s;ued; We were about half a League from Land, when our Carrick &s;truck upon a Rock, and &s;plit in&s;tantly to pie|ces, upon which I let loo&s;e the reins to my Birds, having fir&s;t placed my &s;elf upon the top of the Deck, and with the Shock they all aro&s;e carrying me fortunately to the Land, of which you need not doubt but I was very joy|ful, though it was a mi&s;erable &s;ight to behold my Friends and acquaintance in that woful

<P>As for my &s;elf being now a&s;hoar in an I&s;land inhabited generally by <HI>Spaniards,</HI> I reckoned I was &s;afe, but I &s;oon found my &s;elf much mi&s;taken, for it was my hap to pitch up|on that part of the I&s;le where the <HI>Pike</HI> afore|mentioned begins to ri&s;e, which is inhabited by a Savage kind of People who live upon the &s;ides of that Hill, the top whereof is for the mo&s;t

But what of that! O Reader prick up thy Ears and prepare thy &s;elf to hear the &s;trange&s;t chance that ever happened to any Mortal Man, and which I know thou wilt not have the grace to believe till thou &s;ee&s;t the like Ex|periment, which I doubt not in a &s;hort time may be performed. My <HI>Gan&s;a's</HI> like &s;o many Hor&s;es that had gotten the bit between their Teeth, made not their flight, as I &s;aid toward the Cliff I intended, though I u&s;ed my wonted means to direct the Leader of the Flock that way, but with might and main took up toward the top of the <HI>Pike,</HI> and never &s;toot till they came there, a place where they &s;ay never man came before, being in vulgar e&s;timation <HI>(though &s;ince experimentally contra|dicted)</HI> at lea&s;t fifteen Miles in height above the ordinary Level of the Land and Sea; What kind of place I found this I would glad|ly relate, but that I ha&s;ten to matters of far greater Importance; When I was there &s;et down my poor <HI>Gan&s;a's</HI> fell to panting, blow|ing, and gaping for breath as if they would all pre&s;ently have died, therefore I thought good not to trouble them a while, forbearing to drawn them in, which they never u&s;e to in|dure without &s;trugling, but little did I expect what followed.</P>
<PB N="95" REF="52">
<P>It was now the &s;ea&s;on that the&s;e Birds were wont to take their flight away, as our Cucko's and Swallows do in <HI>Spain</HI> toward <HI>Autumn,</HI> and as I afterward found, being mindful of their u&s;ual Voyage ju&s;t when I began to &s;ettle my &s;elf to take them in they as it were with one con&s;ent ro&s;e up, and having no other higher place to make toward, to my un&s;peakable fear and amazement, &s;truck bolt upright, and never left towring upward, &s;till higher and higher, for the &s;pace as I gue&s;t, of an Hour, after which I thought they laboured le&s;s than be|fore, till at length, ah mo&s;t wonderful! they forbore moving any thing at all, and yet re|mained immoveable as &s;teadily as if they had &s;ate upon &s;o many perches, the lines &s;lacked, neither I, nor the Engine moved at all, but continued &s;till, as having no manner of weight. I found then by Experience what no Philo&s;o|pher ever dream't of, namely, that tho&s;e things which we call heavy do not fall toward the center of the Earth as their natural place, but are drawn by a &s;ecret property of the Globe of the Earth, or rather &s;omething within it, even as the Load-&s;tone draweth Iron which is within the Compa&s;s of its attractive Beams. For though in this place my <HI>Gan&s;a</HI>'s could continue unmoved without being &s;u&s;tained by any thing what&s;oever but the Air as ea&s;ily and quietly as a Fi&s;h in the middle of the Wa|ter, yet if they forced them&s;elves never &s;o
<PB N="96" REF="53">little it is impo&s;&s;ible to imagine with what &s;wiftne&s;s they were carried, either upward, downward or &s;ide ways; I mu&s;t ingeniou&s;ly confe&s;s my horrour and amazement in this place was &s;uch, that had I not been arm'd with a true <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Courage and Re&s;o|lution I &s;hould certainly have died for fear.</P>
<P>But the next thing that di&s;turb'd me was the &s;wiftne&s;s of the motion, which was &s;o extra|ordinary that it even almo&s;t &s;topt my breath if I &s;hould liken it to an Arrow out of a Bow, or a Stone thrown down from the top of an high Tower, it would come va&s;tly &s;hort of it; Another thing was exceeding trouble&s;om to me, that is the Illu&s;ions of Devils and Wicked Spirits, who the fir&s;t day of my arrival came about me in great numbers in the &s;hapes and likene&s;s of Men and Women, wondring at me like &s;o many Birds about an Owl, and &s;peaking &s;everal Languages which I under&s;tood not, till at la&s;t I met with &s;ome that &s;poke very good <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Dutch,</HI> and others <HI>Ita|lian,</HI> all which I under&s;tood; And here I had on|ly a touch of the Suns ab&s;ence once for a &s;hort time, having him ever after in my &s;ight. Now though my <HI>Gan&s;a's</HI> were entangled in my lines, yet had they means ea&s;ily to &s;eize upon divers kinds of Flies and Birds, e&s;pecially Swal|lows and Cuckoes whereof there were multi|tudes even like Motes in the Sun, though to
<PB N="97" REF="53">&s;ay truth I never &s;aw them eat any thing at all. As for my &s;elf I was I'le a&s;&s;ure you very much obliged to tho&s;e, whether Men or Devils I know not, who among divers di&s;cour&s;es which I will forbear a while to repeat, told me, <HI>If I would follow their Directions, I &s;hould not only be carried &s;afe home, but be a&s;&s;ured to com|mand at all times all the plea&s;ures of that place.</HI> To which motion not daring to give a flat denial, I de&s;ired time to con&s;ider, and withal intreated them, (though I felt no hunger at all, which may &s;eem &s;trange) to help me to &s;ome Victuals lea&s;t I &s;hould &s;tarve in my Journey; Whereupon they readily brought me very good Fle&s;h and Fi&s;h of &s;everal &s;orts and well dre&s;t, but that it was extream fre&s;h without any reli&s;h of Salt; Wine likewi&s;e I ta&s;ted of divers kinds as good as any in <HI>Spain,</HI> and Beer no better in all <HI>Antwerp.</HI> They ad|vi&s;ed me that while I had opportunity I &s;hould make my Provi&s;ions, telling me that till the next <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> they could help me to no more, if happily then, at which time they would find means to carry me back, and &s;et me &s;afe in <HI>Spain</HI> in any place I would de&s;ire, provided I would become one of their Fraternity, and enter into &s;uch Covenants as they had made to their Captain and Ma&s;ter whom they would not name, I an&s;wered civilly, telling them, <HI>I &s;aw little rea&s;on to rejoice in &s;uch an offer, de|&s;iring them to be mindful of me as occa&s;ion &s;er|ved;</HI>
<PB N="98" REF="54">So for that time I was rid of them, hav|ing fir&s;t furni&s;hed my Pockets with as much Victuals as I could thru&s;t in, among which I would be &s;ure to find a place for a &s;mall Bottle of good Canary.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now declare the quality of the place wherein I then was; The Clouds I perceived to be all under between me and the Earth. The Stars, becau&s;e it was always day, I &s;aw at all times alike, not &s;hining bright as we &s;ee in the night upon Earth, but of a whiti&s;h colour like the Moon with us in the day time, tho&s;e that were &s;een, which were not many, &s;hewed far greater than with us, yea as I gue&s;t no le&s;s than ten times bigger; As for the Moon, being then within 2 days of the change, &s;he appeared of an huge and dreadful greatne&s;s. It is not to be forgot that no Stars appeared but on that part of the Hemi&s;phere next the Moon, and the nearer to her, the larger they appear'd. Again, whether I lay quiet and re&s;ted, or were carried in the Air, I perceived my &s;elf to be always directly between the Moon and the Earth, whereby 'tis plain that my <HI>Gan&s;a's</HI> took their way directly toward the Moon, and al&s;o that when we re&s;ted, as we did at fir&s;t for many hours, either we were in&s;en&s;ibly car|ried round about the Globe of the Earth, though I perceived no &s;uch motion, or el&s;e that according to the opinion of <HI>Copernicus,</HI> the Earth is carried about, and turneth round
<PB N="99" REF="54">perpetually from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, leaving to the Planets only that motion which the A&s;trono|mers call natural, and is not upon the Poles of the Equinoctial, commonly called the Poles of the World, but upon tho&s;e of the Zodiack; The Air in that place I found quiet without any motion of wind, and exceeding temperate, neither hot nor cold, as where neither the Sun beams had any Subject to reflect upon, nor the Earth and Water &s;o near to affect the Air with their natural Quality of coldne&s;s; As for that imagination of the Philo&s;ophers attri|buting heat and moi&s;ture to the Air, I alwaies e&s;teem'd it a fancy; La&s;tly, I remember that after my departure from the Earth, I never felt either hunger or thir&s;t, whether the pu|rity of the Air, freed from the Vapors of the Earth and Water, might yeild nature &s;uffi|cient nouri&s;hment, or what el&s;e might be the cau&s;e I cannot determine, but &s;o I found it, though I was perfectly in health both of body and mind, even above my u&s;ual Vigor. Let us now proceed, which we &s;hall do fa&s;t enough for the future.</P>
<P>Some hours after the departure of that De|vili&s;h Company my <HI>Gan&s;a's</HI> began to be&s;tir them&s;elves, &s;till directing their cour&s;e toward the Globe or body of the Moon, making their way with &s;uch incredible &s;wiftne&s;s, that I con|ceive they advanced little le&s;s than fifty Lea|gues
<PB N="100" REF="55">in an hour, in which pa&s;&s;age I ob&s;erved three things very Remarkable, one that the farther we went the le&s;s the Globe of the Earth appear'd to us, and that of the Moon &s;till lar|ger and more mon&s;trous; Again the Earth, which I had ever in mine eye, &s;eemed to mask it &s;elf with a kind of brightne&s;s like another Moon, and as we di&s;cern certain Spots or Clouds as it were in the Moon, &s;o did I then &s;ee the like in the Earth, but whereas the form of tho&s;e Spots in the Moon are al|ways the &s;ame, the&s;e on the Earth &s;eemed by degrees to change every hour, the rea&s;on whereof &s;eems to be, that whereas the Earth according to his natural motion (for &s;uch a motion I am now &s;atisfied &s;he hath according to the opinion of <HI>Copernicus</HI>) turns round up|on her own Axis every four and twenty hours from We&s;t to Ea&s;t) I &s;hould at fir&s;t &s;ee in the middle of the Body of this New Star the Earth, a Spot like a Pear with a Mor&s;el bit out on one &s;ide, in &s;ome hours I &s;hould ob&s;erve this Spot move away toward the Ea&s;t; This no doubt was the main Land of <HI>Africa;</HI> Then might I perceive a great &s;hining brightne&s;s in that place which continued about the &s;ame time, and was que&s;tionle&s;s the va&s;t <HI>Atlantick</HI> Ocean; After this &s;ucceeded a Spot almo&s;t Oval, ju&s;t as we &s;ee <HI>America</HI> de&s;cribed in our Maps, then another immen&s;e cleerne&s;s re|pre&s;enting
<PB N="101" REF="55"><HI>Mare del Zur</HI> or the <HI>South Sea,</HI> and la&s;tly a number of Spots like the Countreys and I&s;lands in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> &s;o that it &s;eemed to me no other than an huge Mathematical Globe turned round lei&s;urely before me, wherein &s;ucce&s;&s;ively all the Countreys of our earthly World were within twenty four hours repre&s;ented to my view, and this was all the means I now had to number the days, and reck|on the time.</P>
<P>I could now wi&s;h that Philo&s;ophers and Mathematicians would confe&s;s their own blind|ne&s;s, who have hitherto made the World be|lieve that the Earth hath no motion, and to confirm it are forc't to attribute to every one of the cele&s;tial Bodies two Motions directly contrary to each other, one from the Ea&s;t to the We&s;t to be perform'd in twenty four hours with an impetuous rapid motion, the other from We&s;t to Ea&s;t in &s;everal proportions; O incre|dible &s;uppo&s;ition! That tho&s;e huge Bodies of the fixed Stars in the highe&s;t Orb, whereof they confe&s;s divers are above an hundred times bigger than the whole Earth, &s;hould like &s;o many Nails in a Cart wheel be whirled a|bout in &s;o &s;hort a time, whereas it is many thou&s;and years, no le&s;s (&s;ay they) than thirty thou&s;and, before that Orb fini&s;hes his cour&s;e from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, which they call his natural motion; Now whereas they allow their na|tural cour&s;e from We&s;t to Ea&s;t to every one of
<PB N="102" REF="56">them, therein they do well; The Moon per|forms it in &s;even and twenty days, the <HI>Sun, Venus and Mercury</HI> in a year or thereabout, <HI>Mars</HI> in three year, <HI>Jupiter</HI> in twelve, and <HI>Saturn</HI> in thirty. But to attribute to the&s;e ce|le&s;tial Bodies contrary motions at once, is a very ab&s;urd conceit, and much more to imagine the &s;ame Orb wherein the fixed Stars are, who&s;e natural cour&s;e takes up &s;o many thou|&s;ands of years, &s;hould be turned about every twenty four hours. I will not go &s;o far as <HI>Co|pernicus</HI> who makes the Sun the center of the Earth and immoveable, neither will I be po&s;i|tive in any thing, only this I &s;ay, allow the Earth its motion, which the&s;e eyes of mine can te&s;tify to be true, and all tho&s;e ab&s;urdities are removed, every one having only his own &s;ingle and pro|per motion.</P>
<P>But where am I? I promi&s;ed an hi&s;tory, and am unawares turn'd di&s;puter. One Acci|dent more befell worth mention, that during my &s;tay I &s;aw a kind of a reddi&s;h Cloud com|ing toward me, and continually approaching nearer, which at la&s;t I perceived was nothing but a huge &s;warm of Locu&s;ts. He that reads the di&s;cour&s;es of learned men concerning them, as <HI>John Leo</HI> of <HI>Africa</HI> and others who relate that they are &s;een in the Air &s;everal days be|fore they fall on the Earth, and add thereto this experience of mine, will ea&s;ily conclude that they can come from no other place than
<PB N="103" REF="56">the Globe of the Moon. But now give me leave to go on quietly in my Journey for eleven or twelve days, during all which time I was carried directly toward the Globe or Body of the Moon, with &s;uch a violent Whir|ling as is inexpre&s;&s;ible, for I cannot imagine a Bullet out of a Cannon could make way through the vaporous and muddy Air neer the Earth with half that celerity, which is the more &s;trange &s;ince my <HI>Gan&s;a's</HI> moved their Wings but now and then, and &s;ometimes for a quarter of an hour not at all, only holding them &s;tretcht out, as we &s;ee Kites, and Eagles &s;ome|times do for a &s;hort &s;pace, during which pau&s;es I &s;uppo&s;e they took their Naps, and times of Sleeping, for other time I could perceive they never had any; For my &s;elf I was &s;o fa&s;tened to mine Engine that I dur&s;t &s;lumber enough to &s;erve my turn, which I took with as great ea&s;e, though it may &s;eem incredible, as if I had lain on the be&s;t Down-Bed in all <HI>Antwerp.</HI></P>
<P>After eleven days pa&s;&s;age in this violent flight, I perceived we began to approach to another Earth (if I may &s;o call it) being the Globe or very Body of that Star which we call the Moon. The fir&s;t difference I found be|tween this and our Earth was, that it appeared in its natural colours as &s;oon as ever I was free from the attraction of the Earth; Whereas with us, a thing a League or two from us puts on that deadly colour of Blew. I then per|ceived
<PB N="104" REF="57">al&s;o that this World was the greate&s;t part covered with a huge mighty Sea, tho&s;e parts only being dry Land which are unto us &s;ome|what darker than the re&s;t of her Body, I mean, what the Countrey people call, <HI>The Man in the Moon,</HI> and that part which &s;hines &s;o bright is another. Ocean be&s;prinkled with I&s;lands, which for their &s;malne&s;s we cannot di&s;cern &s;o far off; So that the Splendor which appears to us in the Night, is nothing but the re|flection of the Sun beams returned to us out of the Water as from a Lookingla&s;s. How much this di&s;agrees with what our Philo&s;o|phers teach in the Schools is very evident; But alas how many of their Errors hath time and experience refuted in this our Age, and among other vain conjectures, who hath not hitherto believed the upper Region of the Air to be very hot, as being next, for&s;ooth, to the natural place of the Element of Fire; Meer Vanities, Fancies and Dreams; For after I was once free from the attractive Beams of that Tyranous Load-&s;tone the Earth, I found the Air altogether &s;erene, without Winds, Rain, Mi&s;ts or Clouds, neither hot nor cold, but con&s;tantly plea&s;ant, calm and comforta|ble till my arrival in that <HI>New World of the Moon;</HI> As for that Region of fire our Philo&s;o|phers talk of, I heard no news of it, mine eyes have &s;ufficiently inform'd me there is no &s;uch thing.</P>
<PB N="105" REF="57">
<P>The Earth had now by turning about &s;hew|ed me all her parts twelve times when I fi|ni&s;hed my cour&s;e; For when by my reckon|ing it &s;eem'd to be (as indeed it was) <HI>Tue&s;day September</HI> 11. at which time the Moon be|ing two days old was in the twentieth degree of <HI>Libra</HI>) my <HI>Gan&s;a's</HI> &s;eem'd by one con|&s;ent to &s;tay their cour&s;e, and re&s;ted for cer|tain hours, after which they took their flight, and in le&s;s than an hour &s;et me on the top of an high Hill in that <HI>Other World,</HI> where many mo&s;t &s;trange and wonderful things were im|mediately pre&s;ented to my &s;ight, for I ob&s;erved fir&s;t, that though the Globe of the Earth ap|pear'd much greater there than the Moon doth to us, even three times bigger, yet all things there were ten, twenty, yea thirty times lar|ger than ours; Their Trees were thrice as high, and above five times broader and thicker; So were there Herbs, Birds, and Bea&s;ts, though I cannot well compare them to ours, becau&s;e I found not any kind of Bea&s;t or Bird there which any way re&s;embled ours, except Swal|lows, Nightingals, Cuckoes, Woodcocks, Batts, and &s;ome kind of Wild Fowl; And likewi&s;e &s;uch Birds as my <HI>Gan&s;a's,</HI> all which as I now perceived, &s;pend their time in their ab&s;ence from us, in that World, neither do they differ in any thing from ours, but are the very &s;ame kind.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was I upon the ground, but I
<PB N="106" REF="58">found my &s;elf extream hungry, &s;tepping then to the next Tree I fa&s;tned my Engine and <HI>Gan&s;a</HI>'s thereto, and in great ha&s;t fell to ex|amining my Pockets for the Victuals I had re&s;erved there, but to my great &s;urprize and vexation, in&s;tead of Partridges and Capons, which I thought I had hoarded there, I found nothing but a medley of dry leaves, Goats Hair, Sheep or Goats Dung, Mo&s;s, and the like, my Canary-wine was turned, and &s;tunk like Hor&s;e-pi&s;s; Oh the villany and cheats of the&s;e cur&s;ed Spirits, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance if I had depended on, in what a condition had I been! while I &s;tood mu&s;ing and wondring at this &s;trange Metamorpho&s;is, on a &s;udden I heard my <HI>Gan&s;a</HI>'s fluttering behind me, and looking back, I &s;pied them falling greedily upon a Shrub within the reach of their lines, who&s;e leaves they fed earne&s;tly upon, whereas before I had never &s;een them eat any green thing whatever, therefore &s;tepping to the Shrub, I put a leaf to my Mouth, the ta&s;t whereof was &s;o excellent, that I cannot expre&s;s it, and certainly if I had not with great di&s;cre|tion moderated my Appetite, I &s;hould have &s;urfeited thereon, yet it happened to be a good bait both for me and my Birds, when we had mo&s;t need of refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>Scarce had we ended our Banquet, when I &s;uddenly &s;aw my &s;elf &s;urrounded with a &s;trange kind of People both in feature, manners, and
<PB N="107" REF="58">apparel, their Stature was very different, but they were generally twice as high as ours, their &s;hape and countenance plea&s;ant, and their habit hardly to be de&s;crib'd, for I never &s;aw either Cloth, Silk, nor other Stuff, like that whereof their Cloths were made, neither, which is yet more &s;trange, can I po&s;&s;ibly relate their colour, they being in a manner all cloth|ed alike; it was neither Black, White, Yellow, Red nor Blue, nor any colour compo&s;ed of the&s;e; If you ask what was is then, I mu&s;t tell you, it was a colour never &s;een in our Earthly World, and therefore neither to be de&s;cribed nor conceived by us, for as it is hard to make a man born blind under&s;tand the difference be|tween Green and Blue, &s;o neither can I de|cipher this Moon colour, as having no affi|nity with any I ever beheld, I can only &s;ay it was the mo&s;t glorious and delightful that can be imagined, neither was any thing more plea&s;ant to me during my &s;tay there.</P>
<P>Being &s;urprized at the appearance of the&s;e People &s;o &s;uddenly and in &s;uch accoutrements, I cro&s;&s;ed my &s;elf and cry'd out, <HI>Je&s;us Maria;</HI> No &s;ooner was the word <HI>Je&s;us</HI> pronounced, but young and old fell all on their knees (whereat I not a little rejoiced) holding up both their hands on high, and repeating certain words which I under&s;tood not; And pre&s;ently ri&s;ing again, one much taller than the re&s;t came and
<PB N="108" REF="59">kindly imbraced me, and ordering as I perceiv|ed, &s;ome of the re&s;t to attend my Birds, he took me by the hand, and led me to his dwel|ling down toward the foot of the Hill, which was a building &s;o great &amp; beautiful, as nothing in our World is comparable thereto; Yet af|terward I &s;aw &s;uch as this &s;eem'd but a Cot|tage in re&s;pect of them; There was no Door about the Hou&s;e le&s;s than thirty Foot high, and twelve broad, the Rooms were forty or fifty Foot in height, and an&s;werable in proportion, neither could they be much le&s;s, the Ma&s;ter thereof being full twenty eight high, and I &s;uppo&s;e his Body would weigh twenty five or thirty of ours; After I had re&s;ted with him about one of our days, he led me five Leagues off to the Palace of the Prince of the Coun|trey, the &s;tateline&s;s whereof I have not now lei&s;ure to de&s;cribe; This Prince was much taller than the former, and called (as neer as I can by letters declare it, for their &s;ounds are not perfectly to be expre&s;t by our Characters,) <HI>Pylonas</HI> which in their Language is <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> or <HI>Chief,</HI> if it doth not rather denote his Autho|rity and Dignity, as being the principal man in all tho&s;e parts; Though yet there is one Su|pream Monarch among&s;t them, much greater of &s;tature than he, commanding over all that whole World, having under him twenty nine other Princes of very great Power, and every one of the&s;e has twenty four Inferior Gover|nours,
<PB N="109" REF="59">whereof this <HI>Pylonas</HI> was one. The fir&s;t Ance&s;tor of this great Monarch came out of the Earth, as they relate, and by marrying the Hei|re&s;s of that va&s;t Monarchy obtaining the go|vernment, left it to his Po&s;terity, who have enjoyed it ever &s;ince, even forty thou&s;and Moons, which is 3077 years; His name was <HI>Irdonozur</HI> who&s;e Heirs to this day a&s;&s;ume the &s;ame name, he, they &s;ay, having continued there about four hundred Moons, and begot divers Children, return'd (though by what means they know not) to the Earth again. I doubt they have their fables as well as we, &s;ince our Hi&s;torians never mention any Earthly Man to have been in that World before my &s;elf, and much le&s;s to have return'd again, I cannot therefore but condemn this tradition as fal&s;e and Romantick, though I found Learning was in great e&s;teem among them, and they &s;eem to dete&s;t Lying and Fal&s;hood which is there &s;everely puni&s;hed, and which may yield &s;ome credit to their Hi&s;torical Narrations. Many of them live wonderful long, even beyond be|lief, affirming to me that &s;ome &s;urvived thirty thou&s;and Moons, which is above a thou&s;and years, &s;o that the Ages of three or four men might ea&s;ily reach to the time of the fir&s;t <HI>Irdo|nozur,</HI> and this is generally noted that the tal|ler people are of Stature, the more excellent are their endowments of mind, and the longer time they live; for their &s;tature is very different,
<PB N="110" REF="60">great numbers not much exceeding ours, who &s;eldom live above a thou&s;and Moons, which is four&s;core of our years, the&s;e they account very ba&s;e, unworthy creatures, but one degree above brute Bea&s;ts, and accordingly imploy in the mo&s;t mean and Servile Offices, calling them Ba&s;tards, Counterfeits or Changlings; Tho&s;e whom they account true <HI>Natural Lunars</HI> or <HI>Moon Men,</HI> exceed ours generally thirty times, both in quantity of Body, and length of life, proportionable to the quality of the day in both Worlds, theirs containing almo&s;t thirty of our days.</P>
<P>The manner of our travel to the Pa|lace of <HI>Pylonas</HI> was more &s;trange and incre+dible than any thing we have related, for at our fir&s;t &s;etting forth there were de|livered to each of us two Feather Fans like tho&s;e our Ladies in <HI>Spain</HI> cool them&s;elves with in Summer; You mu&s;t under&s;tand that the Globe or the Moon has likewi&s;e an attractive power, yet &s;o much weaker than the Earth, that if a man do but &s;pring up|ward with all his &s;trength, as Dancers do in &s;hewing their Tricks, he will be able to mount fifty or &s;ixty foot high, and being then above all attraction from the Moons Earth, he falls down no more, but by the help of the&s;e Fans as with Wings, they convey them&s;elves in the Air in a &s;hort &s;pace, (though not quite &s;o &s;wift as Birds) whither they plea&s;e. In two
<PB N="111" REF="60">hours time (as I could gue&s;s) by the help of the&s;e Fans we were carried through the Air tho&s;e five Leagues, in all about &s;ixty Per&s;ons. Being arrived at the Palace of <HI>Pylonas,</HI> after our Conductor had got Audience, and decla|red what manner of Pre&s;ent he had brought, I was immediately called in to him by his At|tendants; By the Stateline&s;s of his Palace and the reverence done him, I &s;oon perceived his great|ne&s;s, and therefore managed my affairs in order to procure his favour accordingly, and having, as you may remember, a certain little Box or Casket of Jewels, the remainder of tho&s;e I brought from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> before I was in|troduced I &s;ecretly took them out of my pocket, and chu&s;ing &s;ome of each &s;ort, I made them ready to be pre&s;ented as I &s;hould think conve|nient.</P>
<P>I found him &s;itting in a mo&s;t magnificent Chair of State with his Wife or Queen on one hand, and his Elde&s;t Son on the other, one at|tended by a Troop of Ladies, and the other of young men, and all along the &s;ide of the Room &s;tood a great number of hand&s;om Per|&s;onages, whereof &s;carce one was lower of Sta|ture than <HI>Pylonas,</HI> who&s;e Age they report is now one and twenty thou&s;and Moons. At my entrance I fell on my knees, and though fit to addre&s;s to him with the&s;e words in Latin, <HI>Propitius &s;it tibi Princeps Illu&s;tri&s;&s;ime Dominus No&s;ter Je&s;us Chri&s;tus,</HI> &amp;c. As the former Peo|ple,
<PB N="112" REF="61">&s;o the&s;e hearing the holy name of our Savi|our, the King, Queen, and all the re&s;t kneel|ed, pronouncing a word or two, I under&s;tood not, being ri&s;e again, I proceeded. <HI>Et Maria, Salvatoris Genetrix Petrus &amp; Paulus,</HI> &amp;c. And &s;o reckoning up a number of Saints to find if they honoured any of them as their Patron, at la&s;t naming among many other St. <HI>Martinus</HI> they all bowed their heads and held up their hands in &s;ign of great reverence, the rea&s;on whereof I found was, that <HI>Martin</HI> in their Language &s;ignifies God. Then taking out my Jewels, I pre&s;ented to the King &s;even Stones of &s;everal &s;orts, a Diamond, a Ruby, an Emerald, a Sa|phire, a Topaz and an Opal, which he accept|ed with great Joy and admiration, as having &s;eldom &s;een the like; Then I offered the Queen and Prince &s;ome others, and de&s;ign'd to have be&s;tow'd divers more upon his Atten|dants, but <HI>Pylonas</HI> forbid them to accept any, &s;uppo&s;ing, as I heard, they were all I had, which he would have me re&s;erve for <HI>Irdonozur</HI> his Soveraign; He then imbraced me with much indearedne&s;s, &amp; inquired divers things by &s;igns, which I an&s;wered in the &s;ame manner to the be&s;t of my Skill, which not contenting him, he delivered me to the guard of 100 of his Giants as I may well call them, &s;trictly charging them that I &s;hould want nothing fit for me; That they &s;hould &s;uffer none of the <HI>Dwarf Lunars</HI> or <HI>little Moon Men,</HI> if I may &s;o term them, to
<PB N="113" REF="61">come near me. That I &s;hould with all dili|gence be in&s;tructed in their Language, and la&s;tly that they &s;hould by no means impart to me the knowledge of &s;everal things by him Specified, what they were I could never un|der&s;tand. It may be you long to know what <HI>Pylonas</HI> inquired of me; Why what &s;hould it be but, whence I came, how I arrived there, what was my name and bu&s;ine&s;s, with the like, to all which I an&s;wered as near the truth as po&s;|&s;ible.</P>
<P>Being di&s;mi&s;t I was provided with all ne|ce&s;&s;aries as my heart could wi&s;h, &s;o that I &s;eem'd to be in a Paradi&s;e, the plea&s;ures where|of did not yet &s;o tran&s;port me, but I was much concerned with the thoughts of my Wife and Children, and therefore &s;till retaining &s;ome Sparks of Hope that I might again return to them I tended my <HI>Gan&s;a's</HI> dayly with much care, which yet had &s;ignified little if other men had not done more than I could; For now the time came when of nece&s;&s;ity all peo|ple of our Stature, and my &s;elf likewi&s;e, mu&s;t needs &s;leep thirteen or fourteen whole days together, for by a &s;ecret and irre&s;i&s;tible decree of nature when the day begins to appear, and the Moon to be enlightned by the Sun Beams which is in the fir&s;t Quarter of the Moon, all people of our &s;tature inhabiting the&s;e parts fall into a dead &s;leep, and are not po&s;&s;ibly to be wakened till the Sun &s;et, and is withdrawn, for as Owls
<PB N="114" REF="62">and Bats with us cannot indure the light, &s;o at the fir&s;t approach of day we begin to be amazed therewith, and fall immediately into a &s;lumber, which grows by degrees into a dead &s;leep till the light be gone, which is in fourteen or fifteen days, that is till the la&s;t Quarter.</P>
<P>Some will be apt to wonder what light there is in that World during the Suns ab&s;ence, to them I declare that there is a two fold light, one of the Sun which I could not endure to behold, and another of the Earth; Now that of the Earth was at the height, for when the Moon is at the change, then is the Earth a full Moon to them, and as the Moon increa&s;eth with us, &s;o the light of the Earth decrea&s;eth with them. I then found the light there, though the Sun was ab&s;ent, equal to that with us in the day when the Sun is clouded, but toward the quarter it dayly dimini&s;heth, yet leaving &s;till a competent light, which &s;eems very &s;trange, though not &s;o remarkable as what they there report, that in the other Hemi&s;phere of the Moon, contrary to that I fell upon, where dur|ing half the Moon they &s;ee not the Sun, and the Earth never appears to them, they have notwith&s;tanding a kind of light not unlike our Moon light, which it &s;eems the neerne&s;s of the Stars and other Planets that are at a far le&s;s di&s;tance than from us, affords them.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t under&s;tand that of the <HI>true Lunars</HI>
<PB N="115" REF="62">of <HI>Moon men</HI> there are three kinds, &s;ome a little taller than we, as perhaps ten or twelve Foot high, the&s;e can indure the day of the Moon, when the Earth &s;hines but little, but not the Beams of both, and therefore mu&s;t then be laid a&s;leep; Others are twenty Foot high or above, who can &s;uffer all the light both of the Earth and Sun. There are in a certain I&s;land (the my&s;teries where of are carefully concealed) men who&s;e Stature is at lea&s;t twenty &s;even Foot high of the mea&s;ure of <HI>Spain;</HI> If any other come a land there in the Moons day time, they in|&s;tantly fall a&s;leep; This is called <HI>In&s;ula Mar|tini,</HI> or Gods I&s;land, and hath a particular Go|vernour, who as they report is &s;ixty five thou|&s;and Moons old, which makes five thou&s;and of our years, his name is &s;aid to be <HI>Hiruch,</HI> and he in a manner commands <HI>Irdonozur</HI> him|&s;elf, e&s;pecially in that I&s;land out of which he never removes; There is another likewi&s;e comes often thither, who they &s;ay is not above half his Age, that is about thirty three thou&s;and Moons, or two thou&s;and &s;ix hundred of our years, and he orders all things throughout the whole Globe of the Moon in matters of Reli|gion and the Service of God, as ab&s;olutely as our holy Father the Pope doth in any part of <HI>Italy,</HI> I would fain have &s;een this man, but was not permitted to come near him, his name is <HI>Imazes.</HI></P>
<P>Now let me &s;ettle my &s;elf to a long nights
<PB N="116" REF="63">&s;leep, to which end my Attendants take charge of my Birds, prepare my lodging, and &s;ignifie to me by &s;igns how I mu&s;t order my &s;elf. It was then about the middle of <HI>September,</HI> when I perceived the Air more clear than ordinary, and with the increa&s;e of the light I began to feel my &s;elf fir&s;t dull and then heavy to &s;leep, though I had not been lately di&s;turb'd of my re&s;t; At length I delivered my &s;elf into the cu&s;tody of this Si&s;ter of Death, who&s;e Pri&s;oner I was for almo&s;t a Fortnight after, and then awaking, it is not to be believed how fre&s;h, brisk and vigorous I found the faculties both of my Body and Mind; I then immediately applyed my &s;elf to learning the Language, which is the very &s;ame throughout all the Re|gions of the Moon, yet not &s;o wonderful, &s;ince I believe all the Earth of Moon does not amount to the fortieth part of our inhabited Earth, partly becau&s;e the Globe of the Moon is far le&s;s than that of the Earth, and be&s;ides the Sea or Ocean covers very nigh three parts of four, whereas the Land and Sea in out World may be judged of an equal mea&s;ure. Their Lan|guage is very difficult, &s;ince it hath no Affi|nity with any other I ever heard, and con&s;i&s;ts not &s;o much of Words and Letters as Tunes and &s;trange &s;ounds which no Letters can ex|pre&s;s, for there are few words but &s;ignifie di|vers and &s;everal things, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed only by their Sounds, which are &s;ung as it were
<PB N="117" REF="63">in uttering yea many words con&s;i&s;t of tunes on|ly without words; By occa&s;ion whereof I find a Language may be framed, and ea&s;ily learned, as copious as any other in the World only of Tunes which is an Experiment worth &s;earching after; Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e difficulties within two months I attained to &s;uch knowledge therein that I under&s;tood mo&s;t Que&s;tions demanded of me, and with &s;igns and words made rea&s;onable &s;hift to utter my mind, which <HI>Pylonas</HI> having notice of, he oftimes &s;ent for me, and was plea&s;|ed to inform me of many things my Guardians dur&s;t not di&s;clo&s;e, though I mu&s;t needs &s;ay I ne|ver found they abu&s;ed me with an untruth, but if I asked a que&s;tion they were unwilling to re|&s;olve, they would &s;hake their heads, and with a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;hrug divert to &s;ome other di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>After &s;even Months time it happened the great <HI>Irdonozur</HI> making his Progre&s;s to a place about two hundred Leagues from the Palace of <HI>Pylonas,</HI> &s;ent for me, yet would not admit me into his pre&s;ence but di&s;cour&s;t me through a Window where I might hear him, and he hear and &s;ee me at plea&s;ure. I pre&s;ented him the remainder of my Jewels which he very thank|fully accepted, &s;aying he would requited them with gifts of a far more con&s;iderable value. I &s;tay'd there not above a quarter of a Moon when I was again &s;ent back to <HI>Pylonas,</HI> for if we had &s;tay'd a day or two longer the Sun would have overtaken us before we could have
<PB N="118" REF="64">recovered our home. The gifts he be&s;towed on me were &s;uch that a man would part with Mountains of Gold to purcha&s;e, they were all Stones nine only in number, of three &s;orts, one called <HI>Polea&s;tis,</HI> another <HI>Machrus,</HI> and the third <HI>Ebelus,</HI> of each &s;ort 3. the fir&s;t are about the bigne&s;s of an Hazel-nut very like Jet, which among many other incredible Virtues hath this property, that being once put in the Fire they ever after retain their heat, though with|out any outward appearance, till quenched with &s;ome kind of liquor which no way endamages them though heated and cooled therein a thou&s;and times; Their heat is &s;o vehement that it will make any Metal within a foot of it red hot, and being in a Chimney warms the Room as if a great fire were kindled therein. The <HI>Machrus</HI> is yet more precious, in colour like a <HI>Topaz,</HI> &s;o clear and re&s;plendent as though not above the bigne&s;s of a Bean, yet being placed in the night in the mid&s;t of a large Church it makes all as light as if an hundred Lamps were hanged round; can any man wi&s;h for more u&s;eful properties in a Stone than the&s;e? Yet my <HI>Ebelus</HI> is &s;o excellent that it may be much prefer'd before them, yea prized above all the Diamonds, Saphires, Rubies, and Emeralds that our World can afford. The <HI>Lunar</HI> colour is &s;o exceeding beautiful that a man would travel a thou&s;and Leagues to behold it, the Shape is &s;omewhat flat, of the breadth of
<PB N="119" REF="64">a peice of Eight, and twice the thickne&s;s, one &s;ide is of a more Orient colour than the other, which being clapt to a mans bare Skin, takes away all the weight and ponderou&s;ne&s;s of his Body, but turning the other &s;ide, it adds force to the attractive beams of the Earth either in this World or that, and makes the body half as heavy again; Do you wonder now why I &s;hould &s;o overprize this &s;tone? before you &s;ee me on Earth again, you will find I have rea&s;on to value this invaluable Jewel. I inquired whe|ther they had not any kind of Jem, or other means to make a man invi&s;ible, which I judged a thing of admirable u&s;e, and could mention divers of our learned men who had written to this purpo&s;e; They an&s;wered, that if it were po&s;&s;ible, yet they were &s;ure Heaven would not &s;uffer it to be revealed to us creatures &s;ub|ject to &s;o many imperfections, and which might be ea&s;ily abu&s;ed to ill purpo&s;es, and this was all I could get of them.</P>
<P>Now after it was know that <HI>Irdonozur</HI> the great Monarch had done me this honour, it is &s;trange how much all re&s;pected me more than before; my Guardians who had been hitherto cautious in relating any thing of the Govern|ment of that World, grew now more open, &s;o that from them and <HI>Pylonas</HI> together I under|&s;tood many notable particulars; As that in a thou&s;and years there is found neither Thief nor Whore-Monger, for fir&s;t there is no want

Here is a mo&s;t delicious Brook of &s;weet Wa|ter ari&s;ing out of a mighty Hill hard by, called for its form, <HI>The Table,</HI> neer which is another Hill exceeding high like a <HI>Pyramid,</HI> and called by <HI>Europeans</HI> the <HI>Sugar-loaf</HI> here are great &s;tore of Cattel as little Cows, called by the barbarous Inhabitants <HI>Boos,</HI> and Sheep which they name <HI>Baas,</HI> who bear a &s;hort, cour&s;e, hairy Wooll, and &s;eem to have been never &s;horn.

<P>This remote&s;t part of <HI>Africa</HI> is very moun|tainous, and overun with wild Bea&s;ts, as Ly|ons, Tygers, Wolves, and many other Bea&s;ts of Prey, which in the &s;ilent night di&s;cover them&s;elves by their noi&s;e and roaring; To the Teeth and Jaws of which cruel creatures the Natives do here expo&s;e their old people if death prevent not, when once they grow de|crepit and trouble&s;om, laying them forth in &s;ome open place in the dark night, when the Wild Bea&s;ts creep forth, and the young Ly|ons roar after their Prey. One mi&s;erable poor Old wretch was thus expo&s;ed when &s;ome <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Ships were there, who by his pitiful cries was di&s;covered by our Court of Guard that
<PB N="118" REF="77">were there a&s;hoar not far from him by whom he was relieved and delivered for that pre&s;ent out of the Jaws of Death, and they asking <HI>Cooree</HI> one of the Natives (of whom hereafter) why they did &s;o, he replied, <HI>It was their</HI> Cu&s;tom when their People had lived &s;o long that they knew not what to do with them thus to be rid of them; They &s;aw in this Bay of <HI>Souldania</HI> many Whales, and about the Shoar divers party-coloured Fowls and O&s;triches; The Soil about the Bay &s;eems very good, but the Sun &s;hines not upon a People in the whole World more Barbarous than tho&s;e which po&s;|&s;e&s;s it, being rather Bea&s;ts in the Skins of men, than Men in the Skins of Bea&s;ts, as appears by their Ignorance, Habit, Language, Diet and other things wherein they appear ab&s;olutely bruti&s;h.</P>
<P>For as to Religion, generally all the People in the World as well Heathen as Chri&s;tian do acknowledge the great God of Heaven and Earth, but they, as <HI>Cooree</HI> told us, own no God at all; Their &s;peech &s;eems rather an in|articulate noi&s;e than a Language, &s;ounding like the clucking of Hens, or Gabling of Turkies, wherewith as they walk about, they make a ve|ry &s;trange confu&s;ed noi&s;e, if there be two, three, five, ten, twenty or more in company it is their manner to walk in rank one after another in &s;mall paths they have made by there going thus, as Cows in Summer do many times when
<PB N="119" REF="77">they come home to the pail, or as Wild Gee&s;e who fly in Ranks, and as they fly make a noi&s;e, &s;o the&s;e walking together gabble from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t in company as if all &s;pake and none an&s;wered; Their Habits are their Sheep-Skins undre&s;t thonged together, which cover their bodies to the middle, with a little flap of the &s;ame Skin tyed before them, being naked downward, when it is cold they put the Woolley, and when hot the Fle&s;hy &s;ide of tho&s;e Skins next their Body. Their Ornaments and Jewels are Bullocks or Sheep&s;guts full of Ex|crements about their Necks, and therefore when we bought their Cattel they would take, and we were content they &s;hould, their Skins, Guts, and Garbage, which plentifully furni&s;h't them with that &s;tinking attire; When they are hungry they &s;it down upon &s;ome hillock, fir&s;t &s;haking &s;ome of that filthy pudding out of the Guts about their Neck, then bowing down their Mouths to their hands almo&s;t as low as their knees, like hungry Dogs they gnaw and eat the Raw Guts, which you may conceive fills their Mouths full of &s;weet Green Sauce.</P>
<P>The Women are adorned, habited and dieted in the &s;ame manner, only they wear more about their lower parts than the men, they carry their &s;ucking Infants under their Skins upon their backs, and their Brea&s;ts hanging down like Bagpipes, they put up with their hands to their Children that they may &s;uck them over
<PB N="120" REF="78">their Shoulders; Both Sexes make coverings for their heads of Cow-dung and &s;uch like &s;ilth, mingled with a little &s;tinking Grea&s;e they be|&s;mear their Faces with, which makes their Company in&s;ufferable if they get the Wind of you; I ob&s;erved (&s;aith my Author) that &s;ome of the re&s;t of their Diet was agreeable to the former, for they would not refu&s;e any thing, as rotten and mouldy Biskets which we have given them, fit for nothing but the dunghill, yea they will devour what a hungry Dog in <HI>England</HI> would refu&s;e. I once ob&s;erved a cou|ple of them, who had found on the Neighbour Shoar a large peice of a dead Fi&s;h the Sea had ca&s;t up, which &s;tunk intolerably, they made a little fire with dry Cow-dung wherewith they warm'd and then eat it, with as much appetite as an hungry man with us would feed upon a very choice and Savoury Di&s;h, which makes me apt to believe that the&s;e wretched creatures have but three &s;en&s;es, wanting the benefit both of &s;melling and ta&s;ting. The&s;e Brutes devote them&s;elves to Idlene&s;s, for they neither &s;pin nor dig; They are very &s;treight and well limb'd, though not very Tall, their Faces very ill favoured, mo&s;t of their No&s;es flat, have little or no beard, the hair on their heads &s;hort, black and curled, their Skins very tawny, &s;wift they are of foot, and will throw Darts and &s;hoot Arrows (which are their Weapons) very dan|gerou&s;ly.</P>

<P>I &s;hall here in&s;ert a true Relation (&s;aith my Author) about three years before I went to <HI>India</HI> which was in 1615 one of the <HI>Ea&s;t In|dia</HI> Companies Ships returning thence and ar|riving at this Harbor, after a little &s;tay when &s;he was ready to Sail, and having then two of the&s;e Salvages aboard, the Commander re|&s;olv'd to bring them both home with him, imagining that having learnt <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> here, they might di&s;cover &s;omething of their Countrey yet unknown to us; The&s;e poor wretches thus &s;urprized and carried away again&s;t their wills were much di&s;turbed; One of them meerly out of &s;ullenne&s;s, though he was very well u&s;ed, died &s;oon after they put to Sea; The other who called him&s;elf <HI>Cooree</HI> a forenamed, was brought to <HI>London,</HI> and there kept Six Months in Sir <HI>Thomas Smiths</HI> Hou&s;e then Governor of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Company, where he had good Diet, good Cloths, good Lodging, and all other fitting Accommodations; One would have thought that this wretch might have conceived his pre&s;ent, compared with his former Condition a Heaven upon Earth.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e things gave him no content, though to his good Entertainment he had gal|lantry added, having a Chain of Bright Bra&s;s, with Brea&s;t, Back and Headpeice of the &s;ame, and a Buckler all of Bra&s;s his beloved Metal, yet all this did not now plea&s;e him, for never did any man &s;eem more weary of ill U&s;age,
<PB N="122" REF="79">than he was of Courte&s;ies, none being ever more de&s;irous of returning to his Countrey than he; For when he had learn'd a little of our Lan|guage he would dayly lye on the ground and cry out very often in broken <HI>Engli&s;h, Cooree home go, Souldania go, home go.</HI> And not long after when he had his de&s;ire, and was return'd home, he had no &s;ooner &s;et footing on his own &s;hore but he pre&s;ently threw away his Cloths, his Linnen, with all his other covering, and in&s;tantly got his Sheep-Skins upon his back, guts about his Neck, and a per&s;um'd Cap of Cow-dung on his Head, and &s;o returned <HI>like a Dog to his vomit, &amp; a Swine to his wallowing in the Mire,</HI> without a Metaphor; After this Fel|low was returned, it made the Natives very &s;hy of us when we arrived there, for though they would come about us in great Companies when we fir&s;t arrived, yet three or four days before they thought we would depart thence there was not one of them to be &s;een, fearing we would have dealt with them as formerly with <HI>Cooree.</HI> But it had been well he had never &s;een <HI>England,</HI> for as he di&s;covered nothing to us, &s;o certainly when he came home he told his Countreymen, having doubtle&s;s ob&s;erv'd it here, that Bra&s;s was but a ba&s;e and cheap com|modity in <HI>England,</HI> and it may be we had &s;o well &s;tored them with that Metal before, that we had never after &s;uch a free exchange of our Bra&s;s and Iron for their Cattel.

<P>In 1614.

So that there re|mained only eight, which were here left with Amunition and Victual, and a &s;mall Boat to carry them to and from a very little uninha|bited I&s;land, lying in the very Mouth of the Bay of <HI>Souldania,</HI> as a place for their re|treat and &s;afety from the Natives on the Main; It is called <HI>Penguin</HI> I&s;land, probably &s;o named by &s;ome <HI>Wel&s;hman,</HI> in who&s;e Language <HI>Penguin</HI>

<P>But to return to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the Government of that Empire is purely De&s;potick or Tyrani|cal, for the King has the &s;ole Power of life and death over all his Subjects, independent from his Council, and without any Trials or Law Proceedings. He can put to what death he plea&s;es the chief Lords of the Kingdom, no man daring to di&s;pute the rea&s;on; Nor is there any Soveraign in the World more ab&s;olute than he.

<PB N="146" REF="92">knowing a rea&s;on, but the Eunuch compa&s;&s;io|nating the young Prince, moved an Iron yet not red hot before his Eyes, and teaching him to counterfeit him&s;elf blind, pre&s;erv'd his &s;ight till his Father lay upon his Death bed, when being very Penitent for having put out the Eyes of his Elde&s;t Son to whom the Crown did of right belong, the Eunuch &s;eeing the King &s;o &s;adly afflicted, and ready to give up the Gho&s;t, a&s;&s;ured him that he would re&s;tore the Prince to his &s;ight, and to comfort him at his death, brought the Prince with perfect Eyes to his Bed-&s;ide, the &s;ight of whom pro|longed the Kings life till the next day, and gave him time to command all the Grandees of the Court to obey <HI>Sha Abbas</HI> his Elde&s;t Son, as his lawful Succe&s;&s;or and their King.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal of the&s;e Blind Princes at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and I knew one particularly, &s;aith my Author, who is &s;till alive and a Per&s;on of excellent natural Parts; As Blind as he is, he is a great lover of Curio&s;ities, and has built him a Hou&s;e at <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> worth &s;eeing. He is overjoyed when he meets with any rarities out of <HI>Europe,</HI> feeling them in his hands, and cau&s;ing his Eunuchs who are very apprehen|&s;ive to tell him the meaning of every thing; He is a great admirer of Clock-work and Watches, and to know what a Clock it is, he has little points &s;et up in the Dial Plate, and a half hand that he may not be deceived
<PB N="147" REF="92">which points to the hour; With certain Fi|gures which he makes of &s;oft Wax, and &s;ets in order upon a Table, he will ca&s;t up an ac|count very exactly, &s;everal other good quali|ties are eminent in him, and it is a mi&s;erable &s;pectacle that a man &s;hould be reduced to that deplorable condition only becau&s;e he is of the Blood-Royal of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> This State is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed like mo&s;t of tho&s;e in <HI>Europe</HI> into three bodies, fir&s;t that of the Sword, which an|&s;wers to the Nobility, and con&s;i&s;ts of the Kings Hou&s;hold, the <HI>Kans</HI> or Governors, and all the Souldiery.

<P>Among other cunning contrivances, which <HI>Sha Abbas</HI> made u&s;e of to know the true State of his Affairs without tru&s;ting too much to his Mini&s;ters, he oft di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf and went into the City like an ordinary man un|der pretence of buying and &s;elling, making it his bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;cover whether fal&s;e Weights and Mea&s;ures were u&s;ed; Going therefore one Evening out of his Palace in the habit of a Countreyman, he went to a Bakers to buy a Man of Bread, and thence to a Cooks to buy a Man of Roa&s;t-meat, (a Man is &s;ix pound &s;ix|teen ounces to the pound) the King having bought his bargains return'd to the Court,
<PB N="148" REF="93">where he cau&s;ed them to be weighed exactly, he found the Bread to want 57 Drams, and the Meat 43. Upon which he fell into a great rage again&s;t the Officers about him who ought to regulate &s;uch abu&s;es, but e&s;pecially again&s;t the Governor of the City, who&s;e Belly he had cau&s;ed to have been ript up but for the interce&s;&s;ion of certain Lords. Be&s;ides the re|proaches he u&s;ed toward them for their negli|gence, and little affection to the Publick good, di&s;cour&s;ing of the inju&s;tice of fal&s;e Weights, and how &s;adly the cheat fell upon poor men, who having great Families, and thinking to give them eight hundred Drams of Bread, by that fraud deprived them of an hundred forty three, then turning to the Lords pre&s;ent, he demanded what &s;ort of Ju&s;tice ought to be done to tho&s;e People, when none of them da|ring to open their mouths while he was in that Pa&s;&s;ion, he commanded a great Oven to be made in the Market place, together with a Spit big and long enough to Roa&s;t a Man, and that the Oven &s;hould be heated all night, and another Fire to be kindled near the Oven. The next Morning the King cau&s;ed the Cook and Baker to be apprehened, and to be led quite through the City with two men going before them; who proclaimed to the People; <HI>We are going to put the Baker into a red hot Oven in the</HI> Piazza <HI>to be Baked alive for &s;elling Bread by fal&s;e Weights, and the Cook is to be
<PB N="149" REF="93">Roa&s;ted alive for having &s;old Meat by fal&s;e Weights.</HI> Thus the&s;e two men &s;erved for an Example not only to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> but to all the Kingdom, where every one dreaded the &s;e|vere Ju&s;tice of <HI>Sha Abbas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sha Abbas</HI> his Succe&s;&s;or acted almo&s;t &s;uch another piece of &s;everity, for having made one <HI>Jafer Kan</HI> a generous Lord, who kept a magnificent Train, Governor of <HI>A&s;terabat;</HI> At fir&s;t he was very mild, but at la&s;t he began to exact &s;uch &s;ums from the People, that his violences reached the Kings Ear, who being one day drinking with his Lords, and &s;eeing the Ma&s;ter of his Mu&s;ick in the Room, who was a merry Droll, and had always &s;ome plea|&s;ant news to tell the King, he was pleas'd to ask him what the People &s;aid of <HI>Jafer-Kan,</HI> adding that he had made him Governor of di|vers Provinces, and had never heard any complaint of him, but now he was accu&s;ed of &s;trangely Tyranizing over the People. The Mu&s;ick Ma&s;ter being a meer Flatterer, and knowing that <HI>Jafer-Kan</HI> was extreamly be|loved of the King, confidently aver'd, that the Governor was fa&s;ly accu&s;ed, and that he had always known him apter to give than re|ceive. There was at the &s;ame time in the Room an <HI>Agis</HI> lately returned from a Pilgrimage at <HI>Mecca,</HI> him the King al&s;o asked what was his opinion of <HI>Jafer-Kan</HI> and his Government, being a Per&s;on long acquainted with him, to
<PB N="150" REF="94">whom the <HI>Agis</HI> thinking to plea&s;e the King, returned the &s;ame an&s;wer with the Mu&s;ick Ma|&s;ter. Whereupon the King who had been well informed of the <HI>Kans</HI> behaviour, turning toward the Lords pre&s;ent, <HI>What think you,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>of the&s;e two Flatterers that ab&s;olutely know the contrary to what they &s;peak.</HI> And at the &s;ame time commanded two of the Mu&s;ick Ma&s;ters Teeth to be pluckt out of his Mouth, and to be driven into the head of the <HI>Agis,</HI> which had like to have co&s;t him his Life, be|ing a very old man; As for <HI>Jafer-Kan</HI> he was di&s;graced for a time, but his excellent Accom|pli&s;hments &s;oon re&s;tored him again to favour.</P>
<P>Murther is &s;everely puni&s;hed, nor will Mo|ney &s;ave the Criminal; When the Murtherer is taken they carry him before the Magi&s;trate who makes quick work, for he delivers him to the Parents or kindred of the Per&s;on &s;lain who carry him to Execution, and without any Com|pa&s;&s;ion torture him to death. I remember &s;aith my Author, the Governor of <HI>Shiras</HI> had a Fa|vourite, who falling in love with a young <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gentleman earne&s;tly endeavoured to abu&s;e his Body; One day meeting upon the Road together, and lying at night under the &s;ame Tent, the Favourite about Mid-night came to his Bed-&s;ide, and after many Sollicita|tions would have forced him; But being vio|lently re&s;i&s;ted, the Favourite for Madne&s;s to find him&s;elf di&s;appointed, and liable to be di&s;|covered,
<PB N="151" REF="94">&s;tab'd the young Gentleman to the heart, and fled to the Mountains. The Murther being divulged, the Mother, Widdow, and Si&s;ter of the Young Man repaired to the Governor for Ju&s;tice, who willing to &s;ave his Favourite offered them Money, which they with &s;corn refu&s;ing, &amp; threatning to complain to the King, he was thereupon con&s;train'd to per&s;ue his Favourite, at length he took &amp; &s;ent him to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> &s;aying, he would not judge of the Affair, but refer it to the K. The Mother, Widdow, and Si&s;ter immediate|ly followed the Murtherer to <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> and de|manded Ju&s;tice of the King with that eager|ne&s;s, that though the King had an inclination to &s;ave the Favourite for the Governors Sake, he was forced to abandon him and bid them pay them&s;elves with his bloud. Immediately he was carried to Execution, where the Widdow fir&s;t &s;tab'd him to the heart with a dagger, then the Mother took her turn, and after that the Si&s;ter, and then holding a Cup to receive his Blood, drank every one a Cup full to quench the thir&s;t of their Revenge.</P>
<P>Above all things extraordinary care is taken for &s;ecuring the high ways, for which purpo&s;e Guards are &s;et at convenient di&s;tances; As the Caravan was one day &s;etting out from <HI>Tauris</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> a poor Fellow took an occa&s;ion to rob a Cloak-Bag, and fled cro&s;s the Feilds not knowing the way, the Merchant mi&s;&s;ing his Goods complain'd to the Governor who hav|ing
<PB N="152" REF="95">&s;ought for him in vain, &s;ent order to the Guards to &s;earch &s;trictly for him, and &s;end him as &s;oon as &s;eized. In a &s;hort time the Thief was con&s;trained to for&s;ake his Cloak-bag, and came cro&s;s the Fields for Water, who being &s;eized was carried to the Governor, and &s;oon convicted and condemned to Death, for Thieves find no mercy in <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> Only they are vari|ou&s;ly put to death, being &s;ometimes tyed to a Camels tayl by the feet, and their Bellies ript open. Sometimes they are buried alive all but their Heads, and &s;tarved to Death, in which torment they will oft de&s;ire Pa&s;&s;engers to cut off their Heads, though it be a kindne&s;s forbid|den by the Law. But the mo&s;t cruel puni&s;h|ment of all is, when they &s;et the Thief on Hor&s;e back with his extended Arms fa&s;tned to a long &s;tick behind; then larding him with lighted Candels, they &s;uffer them to burn him to the very Bowels; We met two in this mi|&s;ery who de&s;ired us to ha&s;ten their Deaths, which we dur&s;t not do, only we gave them a Pipe of Tobacco according to their de&s;ire. One day there was a great Hubbub in a Bawdy-Hou&s;e where the Woman had pro&s;tituted her own Daughter, the King informed of it, com|manded the Mother to be thrown Head-long from a Tower, and that the Daughter &s;hould be torn in Peices by his Dogs, which he keeps on purpo&s;e for &s;uch Cha&s;tizements.</P>

<P>The pre&s;ent Emperor or Mogol is called <HI>Aureng-zeb,</HI> having u&s;urpt the Kingdom from his Father <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> upon this occa&s;ion. This great King having reigned forty years with much Clemency and Ju&s;tice, in his de|clining Age he fancied a Young Lady of extraordinary beauty not above thirteen years old, and becau&s;e the &s;trength of nature would not permit him to &s;atisfy his pa&s;&s;ion, he took certain Provocatives which were &s;o hot, that he fell thereupon into a di&s;temper which had almo&s;t killed him. This obliged him to &s;hut him&s;elf up in his Court or Apartment, together with his Women for two or three Months during which time he very &s;eldom appeared to his people and that at a great di&s;tance too, which made them believe he was dead. He had &s;ix Children four Sons and two Daughters, whom he loved all alike, making his Sons Governors or Vice Roys of four of the principal Provinces in his Kingdom; During the fal&s;e report of his death, the Elde&s;t Son kept with him, but the other 3 immediatly rebelled, &amp; after many Skirmi&s;hes and much bloud-&s;hed <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> his third Son after the de&s;truction of his three Brethren, cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be declared King keeping his Father Pri&s;oner; Some days before he a&s;cended the Throne he &s;ent to his Father for &s;ome of his Jewels, that he might appear before his people with the &s;ame magnificence his Predece&s;&s;ors had done, <HI>Cha-jehan</HI> taking this reque&s;t of his Sons for an affront put upon him in Pri&s;on, fell into &s;uch a rage that he continued
<PB N="163" REF="100">mad for &s;ome days, and had like to have died upon it; In the exce&s;s of this Vexation he called &s;everal times for a Mortar and Pe&s;tle, threatning to beat all his Jewels to Powder rather than his Son &s;hould have them, but <HI>Begum Saheb</HI> his Elde&s;t daughter who never for&s;ook him, throwing her &s;elf at his feet, and by virtue of that Cri|minal power &s;he had over him as being both his Daugh|ter and his Wife, kept him from u&s;ing that extremity more out of de&s;ign to pre&s;erve, the Jewels for her&s;elf than her Brother to whom &s;he was always a Mortal Enemy; For this rea&s;on when <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> a&s;cended the Throne he had only one Jewel on his Bonnet, and as a kind of Penance that he impo&s;ed upon him&s;elf for &s;o many Crimes, he for &s;ome time would not eat wheaten bread, Fle&s;h nor Fi&s;h, but fed dayly upon Barley Bread, Herbs and Sweat Meats; But <HI>Chajehan</HI> his Father dying in 1666. <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> found him&s;elf rid of an object that every hour reproached his Tyranny, and began to enjoy him&s;elf with more delight, receiving his Si&s;ter <HI>Begum</HI> into favour, and calling her <HI>Cha Begum</HI> or <HI>Princee&s;s Queen,</HI> a Woman of excellent accompli&s;hments, and able to govern an Empire, and had her Father and Brothers taken her Coun&s;el at the beginning of the War <HI>Aureng-zeb</HI> had never been King; He had another Si&s;ter called <HI>Rauchenara Begum</HI> who had always taken his part having &s;ent him all the Gold and Silver &s;he could pro|cure when &s;he fir&s;t heard he had taken Arms, in recom|pence whereof he promi&s;ed her when he came to be King to give her the Title of <HI>Cha Begum,</HI> and that &s;he &s;hould &s;it upon a Throne, all which he performed, and they lived lovingly together, till it happened that the Prince&s;s having &s;ecretly conveyed a hand&s;om young man into her Apartment could not let him out &s;o private|ly, after &s;he had quite tired him, but the King had notice thereof; Thereupon the Prince&s;s to prevent the &s;hame and reproach ran to the King, and in a pretended fright told him, there was a man got into the Haram even to her very Chamber who certainly de&s;igned either to have killed or Robbed her, that &s;uch an accident was never
<PB N="164" REF="101">before known, and that it concerned the &s;afety of his Royal Per&s;on, and he would therefore do well to puni&s;h the Eunuchs who kept the Guard that night. The King ran in&s;tantly in Per&s;on with a great number of Eunuchs, &s;o that the poor Young Man had no way to e&s;cape but by leaping out at a Window into the River that runs by the Pallace Walls, whereupon a multitude of people ran out to &s;eize him, the Kieg commanding they &s;hould do him no harm, but to carry him to the Officer of Ju&s;tice, yet he happily made his e&s;cape, and has not been &s;ince heard of.</P>
<P>It is an Ancient cu&s;tom among the <HI>Indians</HI> that the Hu&s;band happening to dye the wife can never marry again, &s;o that when he is dead, &s;he retires to bewail him, &s;haves her hair, and lays a&s;ide all her ornaments, taking off from her Arms and Legs the Bracelets her Hu&s;band put on when he e&s;pou&s;ed her in token of her &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and her being chained to him, and all her life after &s;he lives &s;lighted and de&s;pi&s;ed, yea wor&s;e than a Slave in the Hou&s;e where &s;he was formerly Mi&s;|tre&s;s. This unfortunate conditon cau&s;es them to hate life and rather dye with their Hu&s;bands than live in &s;uch Contempt, the <HI>Bramins</HI> or Prie&s;ts likewi&s;e per|&s;wading them, that after death they &s;hall meet him again in the other World with greater honour and ad|vantage; Yet can no Woman burn with her Hu&s;bands Body without leave from the Governor of the Place, who being a <HI>Mehometan</HI> and abhoring this execrable cu&s;tom of &s;elf Murther does often deny it to &s;ome Women, who are &s;o offended there at that they &s;pend the re&s;t of their lives, in works of Charity, &s;ome &s;it on the Road Boyling certain Pul&s;e in Water and giving the Liquor to Travellers to drink, others hold Fire ready in their hands to light their Tobacco, others make vows to eat nothing but the undige&s;ted grains, which they find in Cow-dung.

When they were to be burned thirteen Women be|longing to the two <HI>Raja's</HI> Hou&s;es came dancing and leaping, and pre&s;ently got upon the Funeral Pile hold|ing one another by the hands, and being &s;oon after &s;tifled by the Smoak, fell together into the Fire, pre|&s;ently the <HI>Bramins</HI> threw in great heaps of Wood, Pots of Oil, and other combu&s;tible matter to di&s;patch them. When I was at <HI>Patna,</HI> &s;aith my Author, a very hand&s;om young Woman of about two and twenty came to de&s;ire leave of the Governor to be burnt with the Body of her dead Husband; The Governor compa&s;&s;ionating her Youth and Beauty, &s;trove to di&s;&s;wade her, but fin|ding her re&s;olute, he &s;everely askt her, whether &s;he under&s;tood what the Torment of Fire was, and whether &s;he had ever burnt her Fingers? <HI>No, No,</HI> an&s;wered &s;he more &s;toutly than before, <HI>I do not fear fire, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> let you know as much &s;end for a lighted Torch hither.</HI> The Governour abominating her an&s;wer in great pa&s;&s;ion bid her go to the Devil. Some young Lords pre&s;ent de&s;ired the Governor to call for a Torch and try her, which with much ado he did, as &s;oon as the Woman &s;aw it coming &s;he ran to meet it, and held her hand in the Flame without the lea&s;t altering her counterance, &s;earing her Arm up to the very Elbow, that her Fle&s;h looked as if broil'd, whereupon the Governor com|manded her out of his &s;ight.</P>
<P>The Government of the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> is as Arbitrary and Tyrannical as his Neighbours aforementioned, mea|&s;uring his power by his Sword and Lance, and making
<PB N="168" REF="103">his will his Law, there being no Laws upon Record in this Con&s;titution to regulate Governors in the admini|&s;tration of Ju&s;tice but what are written in the Brea&s;ts of the King and his Sub&s;titutes, and therefore they often take the Liberty to puni&s;h the offender rather than the offence, mens per&s;ons more than their Crimes, though they &s;till pretend to proceed by proofs and not pre|&s;umptions. In matters of con&s;equence the <HI>Mogol</HI> him&s;elf will &s;it as Judge, and no Malefactors lye above one night in Pri&s;on and many times not at all, for if the Offender be apprehended early in the morning, he is in&s;tantly brought before the Judge, by whom he is pre&s;ently either acquitted or condemned, if it be Whipping, that is exe|cuted u&s;ually with much &s;everity in the place of Ju&s;tice; If condemned to dye he is pre&s;ently carried from Sen|tence to Execution, commonly in the Market-place, which quick Judgment keeps the People in &s;uch awe, that there are not many Execution. Murder and Theft they puni&s;h with death of what kind the Judge plea&s;e to impo&s;e, &s;ome Malefactors being hang'd, others be|headed, &s;ome impaled or put upon &s;harp Stakes, a death of extream cruelty and torture, &s;ome are torn to pieces by wild Bea&s;ts, &s;ome killed by Elephants, and others Stung to death by Serpents. Tho&s;e that &s;uffer by Elephants, who are trained up for Executions, are thus dealt withal; If the Bea&s;t be commanded by his Rider to di&s;patch the poor trembling Offender pre&s;ently, who lies pro&s;trate before him, he with his broad round Foot at one &s;tamp kills him, but if he be condemned &s;o to die as to feel him&s;elf dye, the Elephant will break his Bones by degrees with his hard trunk, as fir&s;t his Legs, then his Thighs, after that the Bones in both his Arms, this done his wretched Spirit is left to breath its la&s;t out of the mid&s;t of tho&s;e broken Bones.</P>
<P>It is reported that &s;trange kinds of deaths are execu|ted by the command of the King of <HI>Japan</HI> upon his Sub|jects, where &s;ome are Crucified or Nailed to a Cro&s;s, others rather Roa&s;ted than burnt to death, for there is a Stake &s;et up; and a Fire made at a di&s;tance round about
<PB N="169" REF="103">it, the condemned Per&s;on being naked is &s;o fa&s;tned to the Stake that he may move round about it, and &s;o doth as long as he is able to &s;tir till his Fle&s;h begins to bli&s;ter; Then he falls down, and there lies roaring till the Fire made about him puts him to &s;ilence, by taking away both his Voice and Life; The rea&s;on they give for u&s;ing &s;uch exqui&s;ite torments is becau&s;e they count it di&s;ho|nourable for any man to die by an Executioner, and therefore Criminals are u&s;ually commanded to rip up their own Bellies, and tho&s;e who will not do &s;o are tormented in dying, hence the&s;e Condemned Per&s;ons call for their Friends about them, cat and &s;eem to be merry with them, and in the clo&s;e of the Banquet, they in their pre&s;ence commit this &s;ad &s;laughter upon them|&s;elves, for being &s;tript to the middle, the wretched &s;elf|murtherer &s;trikes a &s;harp Knife into the bottom of his Belly, then rips him&s;elf up, and if after this he can wipe his bloody Knife upon a white Paper or Napkin laid by him, he is reckoned to dye with much honour, and is per&s;uaded he goes to <HI>Fakaman,</HI> or the God of War.</P>
<P>When I was in <HI>India,</HI> &s;aith my Author, one was &s;en|tenced by the <HI>Mogol</HI> him&s;elf for killing his own Father to dye thus, fir&s;t a &s;mall Iron Chain was fa&s;tned to his Heels, which was tyed to the hind Leg of a great Ele phant, who drag'd him one whole remove of that King being about ten miles, &s;o that all his Fle&s;h was torn off his Bones when we met him, and appeared to us rather a Skeleton than a Body. Another having killed his own Mother, the Emperour was at a &s;tand to think of a pun|i&s;hment adequate to &s;o horrible a crime, but after a lit|tle pau&s;e, he adjudged him to be &s;tung to death by Ser|pents, accordingly one of tho&s;e Mountebanks who keep them to &s;hew tricks to the people, brought two Ser|pents to do Execution upon this wretched man whom he &s;ound all naked, only a little covering before, and trembling. Then having angred the&s;e venemous Crea|tures, he put one of them to his Thigh, which pre&s;ent|ly twined it &s;elf about that part till it came near his Groin, and there bit him till Blood followed; The o|ther
<PB N="170" REF="104">was fa&s;tned to the out&s;ide of the other Thigh twi&s;t|ing it round, and there bit him likewi&s;e; Notwith&s;tand|ing the Wretch kept upon his Feet near a quarter of an hour, before which the Serpents were taken from him, but he complained extreamly of a Fire that with much torment had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all his Limbs, and his whole Body began to &s;well exceedingly, like <HI>Nafidius</HI> bit by a <HI>Lybyan</HI> Serpent called a <HI>Pre&s;ter,</HI> about half an hour after, the Soul of that unnatural Mon&s;ter left his groaning Car|ca&s;e, and went to his place.</P>
<P>It happened a few years before Sir <HI>Thomas Row</HI> was Amba&s;&s;ador in this Court in 1618. that a Jugler of <HI>Bengala,</HI> a place famous for Witches, brought an Ape before the <HI>Mogol,</HI> who loved Novelties, that did many &s;trange feats, the King to try his skill pluckt a Ring off his Finger, and gave it one of his Boys to hide, whom the Ape pre&s;ently di&s;covered; &s;everal other trials he made, wherein the Ape did his part to admiration; Before he was taken out of his pre&s;ence, this &s;trange and unexpected fancy came into the Kings Head; <HI>There are many di&s;putes,</HI> &s;aid he; <HI>about that true Prophet which &s;hould come into the World, we are for</HI> Mahomet; <HI>The</HI> Per|&s;ians <HI>magnifie</HI> Mortis Ally, <HI>the</HI> Hindoos <HI>or Heathens extol</HI> Bramon, Ram, <HI>and others, the</HI> Jews <HI>are for</HI> Mo&s;es, <HI>and the Chri&s;tians for Chri&s;t;</HI> adding &s;everal other names, to the number of twelve in all, who have all their &s;everal followers in that part of the World; He then cau&s;ed them twelve names to be written on twelve &s;everal Scrolls, and put together to &s;ee if the Ape could draw out the name of the true Prophet, this done the Ape put his paw among&s;t them and pull'd out the name of Chri&s;t; The <HI>Mogol</HI> a &s;econd time cau&s;ed the&s;e twelve names to be writ again in twelve other Scrolls and Cha|racters, and put together, when the Ape again pluckt forth the name of Chri&s;t as before; <HI>Mabomet Chan</HI> a great Favourite pre&s;ent, &s;aid it was an Impo&s;ture of the Chri&s;tians, though none were then there, and de&s;ired he might make a third trial, which granted he put but eleven of tho&s;e names together, re&s;erving the name of
<PB N="171" REF="104">Chri&s;t in his hand, the Ape &s;earching as before pluckt forth his empty paw, and &s;o twice or thrice together the King demanding a rea&s;on for this, was an&s;wered, that happily the thing he looked for was not there, the Ape was bid &s;earch for it, who putting out tho&s;e eleven names one after the other in a &s;eeming indignation rent them, then running to <HI>Mahobet Chan</HI> caught him by the hand where the name of Chri&s;t was concealed, which he opened, and held up to the King, but did not tear it as the former. Upon which the <HI>Mogol</HI> took the Ape, and gave his Keeper a good Pen&s;ion to keep him near about him, calling him <HI>the Divining Ape.</HI> And this was all which followed upon this admirable event, except the great wonder and amazement of the people, the truth whereof, &s;aith my Author, I mo&s;t certainly be|lieve, as being confirmed to me by &s;everal Per&s;ons of different Religions, who all agreed in the &s;tory and the &s;everal circum&s;tances thereof.</P>
<P>I cannot but here relate a remarkable example of a very gro&s;s Flatterer, but a great Favourite of this King, who was noted above others of that Nation to be a great neglecter of God, believing it Religion enough to plea&s;e the <HI>Mogol</HI> his Ma&s;ter, though a Souldier of approved va|lour. This man on a time &s;itting in dalliance with one of his Women, &s;he pluckt an hair from his Brea&s;t about his Nipple in wantonne&s;s, without de&s;igning any hurt. This little incon&s;iderable wound by an unparallel'd fate became the occa&s;ion of his death, beginning pre&s;ently to fe&s;ter, and in a &s;hort time turned to an incurable Can|ker; When he found he mu&s;t needs dye, he &s;pake the&s;e notable words worthy to be recorded, <HI>Who would not have thought but that I who have been &s;o long a Souldier &s;hould have died in the face of an Enemy, either by a Sword, Lance, Arrow, Bullet, or &s;ome &s;uch In&s;trument of death? But now though too late I am forced to confe&s;s that there is a great God above, who&s;e Maje&s;ty I have ever de&s;pi&s;ed, who needs no bigger Lance than an hair to kill an Athei&s;t or a de&s;pi&s;er of his Divinity;</HI> and &s;o de&s;iring the&s;e his la&s;t words might be told the King his Ma&s;ter, he died.</P>

<PB N="179" REF="108">
<P>This Letter for the &s;trange boa&s;ting form, and be|cau&s;e it contains a &s;mall Inventory of that Kings wealth is here in&s;erted; This King was a &s;tout proper man of about thirty two, &s;trong by Sea and Land, his Coun|trey populous, his Elephants many, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> hav|ing there &s;een neer two hundred at a time; His Fri|gates and Gallies carried good Ordnance of all kinds; His building &s;tately, and &s;pacious but not &s;trong; His Court at <HI>Achi</HI> plea&s;ant, having a fine River which he cut and brought eight Miles in twenty days while they were there; He de&s;ired the General to pre|&s;ent his Re&s;pects to the King of <HI>England</HI> and to intreat him to &s;end him two White Women; <HI>For,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>if I get one of them with Child and it prove a Son I will make him K. of</HI> Piaman Pa&s;&s;aman <HI>and of the Coa&s;t from whence you fetch your Pepper, &s;o that you &s;hall not need to come any more to me, but to your own</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>King for tho&s;e Commodities.</HI> He was cruel having pluckt out the Eyes of a Nobleman for look|ing on one of the Kings Women wa&s;hing in a River; Another wearing a Sha&s;h or Turbant beyond his degree, had his head cut round, &s;o far as that was two large; Some he boiled in &s;calding Oyl, others were &s;awn a&s;un|der, Spitted alive, had their Legs cut off, or were otherwi&s;e tortured. The People are tawny and go naked, yet paint their faces, their Prie&s;ts in their Sacrifices wear their Garments &s;o clo&s;e as if they were &s;owed to them with horns on their head turning back, and a Tail hanging down behind, for &s;o they &s;ay the Devil appears to them, their Hair and Faces appear deformed with Green, Black and Yellow Colours.</P>
<P>Another con&s;iderable <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory is at <HI>Bantam</HI> and other places on the I&s;le of <HI>Java Major,</HI> this is the chief City in the whole I&s;land, &s;cituate at the foot of a Mountain, whence i&s;&s;ue three Rivers, two where|of run by the Walls, and the other through the mid&s;t of the City, yet none of them deep enough to admit of any Ships, the Hou&s;es are very mean, con&s;i&s;ting of three chief Streets; The Natives are Heathens, and believe when they dye their Souls enter into &s;ome Bird,
<PB N="180" REF="109">Bea&s;t or Fi&s;h, and therefore they eat neither Fle&s;h nor Fi&s;h, yet toward the South are many who profe&s;s the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Religion, and &s;ome of them called <HI>Faquirs</HI> are de&s;perate Villains, who having been at <HI>Mecca</HI> to vi&s;it <HI>Mahomets</HI> Tomb, upon their return they run through the Streets and kill all they meet with their poy&s;oned Dag|gers, and think that in &s;o doing they do God and <HI>Maho|met</HI> good &s;ervice and &s;hall be &s;aved thereby; If any of the&s;e Mad-men are kill'd their Followers bury them as Saints, and every one contributes toward erecting them a fair Tomb, which they vi&s;it, and be&s;tow Alms upon the Keeper thereof. I remember &s;aith my Author, that in 1642. a Ve&s;&s;el of the <HI>Great Mogols</HI> returned from <HI>Mecca</HI> to <HI>Surat</HI> with a great number of the&s;e <HI>Faquirs</HI> or <HI>Derviches,</HI> and one of them was no &s;ooner landed and had &s;aid his Prayers, but he in&s;tantly took his Dagger and ran among &s;everal <HI>Dutch</HI> Marriners who were un|lading goods upon the Shore, and before they were a|ware this de&s;perate Wretch had wounded &s;eventeen of them whereof thirteen died, at length the Sentinel who &s;tood at the entry of the Tent where the Governour and Merchants were, &s;hot him through the Body &s;o that he fell down dead; Immediately all the other <HI>Fa|quirs</HI> and <HI>Mahometans</HI> who were upon the place took up the Body and buried it, and at the end of fifteen days they had erected him a fair Monument; Every year the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> pluckt it down, but when they are gone the <HI>Faquirs</HI> rebuild it, and plant Banners over it, nay &s;ome perform their Devotions at it; One time, &s;aith my Author, my Brother and I, and a <HI>Dutch</HI> Chy|rurgeon were going along a narrow way, having the Pales of a Garden on one hand, and a River on the o|ther, behind the Pales one of the&s;e Ra&s;caly <HI>Bantamers</HI> had hid him&s;elf, and thru&s;t his Pike between the Pales thniking to have &s;tab'd it into one of our Brea&s;ts, the <HI>Dutch</HI> man being &s;omewhat before, the head of the Pike ran into his Breeches, whereupon we both laid hold on the Staff, but my Brother being next the Pales pre&s;ently leap'd over and ran the <HI>Faquir</HI> through; Whereupon
<PB N="181" REF="109">&s;everal <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> and other Idolaters came and gave my Brother thanks for killing him; After which we waited on the King, and told him what my Brother had done, who was &s;o far from being di&s;plea&s;ed that he gave him a Girdle, for the King and his Governours are glad when tho&s;e Rogues are &s;lain, counting them De&s;perados, and not fit to live.</P>
<P>In 1682. The Elde&s;t Son of the King of <HI>Bantam</HI> made an In&s;urrection, declared him&s;elf King, and by the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Dutch</HI> took the City of <HI>Bantam</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Factory there, proclaiming the old King his Fa|ther a Rebel again&s;t him. About the &s;ame time an Am|ba&s;&s;ador came from the old King to his late Maje&s;ty King <HI>Charles the &s;econd of Ble&s;&s;ed Memory,</HI> by whom he was received and entertained with all manner of kindne&s;s and civility, and having continued here for &s;ome time he returned again to his own Countrey.</P>
<P>At <HI>Socodona</HI> and <HI>Benierma&s;a</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Borneo</HI> the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;etled other Factories; It is accounted as big as <HI>Spain,</HI> richly incompa&s;&s;ed with other &s;maller I&s;lands, and hath a City of the &s;ame name founded on Piles in the Salt Water, with Sumptuous buildings of Stone covered with Coco leaves. The people are generally more white than the re&s;t of the <HI>Indians,</HI> of good Wits and approved Integrity, divided betwixt two Kings and two Religions, the King of <HI>Borneo</HI> and his Wife being <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> tho&s;e of <HI>Laus</HI> &s;till remaining in their An|cient Genteli&s;m; The&s;e believe the Sun and Moon are Man and Wife, and the Stars their Children, a&s;cribing to each of them Divine Honours, and to the Sun e&s;pe|cially, whom they &s;alute at his fir&s;t ri&s;ing with great reverence, repeating certain ver&s;es; Their publick bu&s;ine&s;s is u&s;ually treated in the Night at which time the Councellors of State meet and a&s;cend &s;ome Tree, viewing the Heavens till the Moon ri&s;e, &amp; then go to the Senate hou&s;e Their Apparel is very thin by rea&s;on of the extream heat of the Air, being only a Shirt of Silk or Calico which they wear more for mode&s;ty than warmth.</P>
<P>One of the I&s;les of <HI>Celebs</HI> is called <HI>Maca&s;&s;ar</HI> where the
<PB N="182" REF="110"><HI>Engli&s;h</HI> likewi&s;e &s;etled a Factory, being 600 miles from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, plentiful of all nece&s;&s;aries for the u&s;e of man, in &s;ome parts over-grown with Wood, in which certain fiery Flyes make nightly &s;uch &s;hining light as if every Twig or Bough were a burning Candel, in the mid&s;t are very high Mountains, out of which flow many Navigable Rivers. The I&s;landers have a Cu&s;tom to Poy&s;on their Arrows, and the mo&s;t dangerous Poy|&s;on they u&s;e is the juice of certain Trees in the I&s;land of <HI>Borneo,</HI> which they will temper &s;o as to work a &s;wift or &s;low death at plea&s;ure. They think the King has on|ly the &s;ecret Receit to take away the force of it, who boa&s;ts that he has the mo&s;t effectual Poy&s;on in the World, which there is no Remedy can prevent. One time an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> in heat of Blood had killed one of the King of <HI>Maca&s;&s;ers</HI> Subjects, and though the King had par|doned him, yet both <HI>Engli&s;h, Hollanders</HI> and <HI>Portugals,</HI> fearing if the <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> &s;hould go unpuni&s;hed the <HI>I&s;landers</HI> would revenge it upon &s;ome of them, be&s;ought the King to put him to death, which with much ado being granted, the King unwilling to put him to a lingting death, and de&s;irous to &s;hew the effect of his Poy|&s;on re&s;olved to di&s;patch the Criminal him&s;elf, whereupon he took a long Trunk, and &s;hot him exactly in the great Toe of the right Foot, the place he particularly aimed at; Two Chirurgeons one an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> the other an <HI>Hollander</HI> provided on purpo&s;e, imme|diately cut off his Toe, but for all that the Poy&s;on had di&s;per&s;|ed it &s;elf &s;o &s;peedily that the <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> died pre&s;ently; All the Kings and Princes of the Ea&s;t are very diligent in inquiring after &s;trong Poy&s;ons, and &s;ome <HI>Europeans</HI> having tryed &s;everal of their Arrows by &s;hooting at Squirrels, ob&s;erved they fell down dead as &s;oon as they were touched.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the principal Acqui&s;itions of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the&s;e re|mote parts of the World, little or nothing more being to be &s;aid of the re&s;t which are not very con&s;iderable, and &s;ome of them &s;ince quitted by the Honourable <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company; Having there|fore compleated my u&s;ual &s;cantling, I &s;hall here conclude.</P>
