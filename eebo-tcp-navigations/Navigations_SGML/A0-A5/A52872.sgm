<P>THe following Sheets will Accomodate you with the Plea|&s;ure of &s;urveying the Fam'd and Spacious Dominions of the Renowned <HI>CZAR</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;covy,</HI> in which you may rightly Inform your &s;elf of all that is Rare or Admirable in that <HI>Northern Track,</HI> which for many Ages has been the Theatre of great Actions, and undergone divers notable Revolutions; a Country every where &s;poken of by <HI>Travellers,</HI> and a Trade or Commerce &s;ought with it eagerly by di&s;tant Nations. Here you have the State of things &s;o Compact and Lively repre&s;ented that the&s;e few Sheets cannot mi&s;s of their end, in being exceeding Satisfactory, becau&s;e I may be bold to &s;ay, I have not omitted whatever can be rea&s;onably requir'd in &s;uch an undertaking, even in the Minute&s;t matters the Curious &s;earchers after the Know|ledge of Remote Regions are apt to pry into, and thereby &s;atiate their Curio&s;ity with variety,</P>
<P>I &s;hall not trouble you with my Rea&s;ons (as many too formally do on the like occa&s;ions) for this undertaking, but rather leave you to your own Conjectures; yet one thing I cannot pa&s;s over in &s;ilence, which is, that it may not prove only plea&s;ant in Reading, but very profitable and advantageous to &s;uch as <HI>Trade,</HI> or may happen to <HI>Travel,</HI> in &s;o large a part of the <HI>World,</HI> becau&s;e it contains &s;omething of <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> as well as di&s;cription, inter|weaving <HI>Antiquity</HI> with <HI>Modern</HI> &s;peculation, co&s;ting no &s;mall pains to produce &s;o fair a birth, when &s;uch &s;lender accounts were to be had (from tho&s;e that have re&s;ided there) to form it.

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> Antient and Modern: Its Situation, Extent, Divi&s;ion into Provinces, Rivers, Soile, Latitude, Sterility and Fertility of the Fruits, Corn, and other Commodities it produces, with Ob&s;ervations on the Extream Cold and Heat Incident to this &s;pacious Country, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WE find by Experience, that God in his Infinite Wi&s;dom has Framed and Po&s;ited the Globe of Earth and Wa|ters, with the Dependant Elements, &s;o Admirable in every part, that Man cannot but be &s;urpriz'd with wonder when he con&s;iders the Harmony in all the &s;pacious Ma&s;s, and his Curio&s;ity would be tired with a too tedious &s;earch into every particular. Let it &s;uffice then that Modern Di&s;coveries have brought to light, what former Ages knew little (or were altogether Ignorant) of. I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t on the <HI>American,</HI> or New World (&s;o termed by many) That, but a few Ages pa&s;t, all Europe, and, I may with rea&s;on &s;ay, the then two other Divi&s;ions of the Suppos'd Total Univer&s;e were &s;trangers to; for, my bu|&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent not lying that way, I &s;hall bend it on the va&s;t Northern Track of Country, antiently hinted at, and now &s;o well di&s;cover'd by the Name of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia;</HI> but more properly, to follow the Modern Writers <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;covy,</HI> as the far nobler, and mo&s;t ac|cepted Name of that part of Earth, producing great advantages to &s;uch as Trade with it, and an Improvement of Knowledge to tho&s;e that Travel its Spacious Limits.</P>
<P>The Famed Country of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> or as &s;ome will have it <HI>Ru&s;|&s;ia,</HI> is bounded on the Ea&s;t with the River <HI>Ob,</HI> or <HI>Oby,</HI> and the
<PB N="2" REF="4"> <HI>Negayan Tartars;</HI> on the We&s;t with <HI>Lithuania, Livonia</HI> and <HI>Po|and;</HI> on the North with <HI>Lapland</HI> and the Ocean; on the South with a part of <HI>Tartary,</HI> called the <HI>Crimee:</HI> It was formerly cal|led <HI>Sarmatia,</HI> and, as mo&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, changed its Name (becau&s;e it was divided into divers &s;mall, but Ab&s;olute Governments) to that of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia;</HI> for, in their Language the Word &s;ignifies a Part|ing, or Dividing.</P>
<P>VVhen this Country was called <HI>Sarmatia,</HI> it was divided into Two Principal Parts, the VVhite and Black. The fir&s;t of the&s;e contain'd all that lyeth towards the North, and on the part of <HI>Liefland,</HI> viz. (as now the Provinces are nam'd) <HI>Vagha, Duyna, Vologda, &V;&s;tio, Carga, Polia, Novogrodia,</HI> and &s;ome others of le&s;&s;er note. As for the Black <HI>Sarmatia</HI> of the Antients, It comprehended the Southern part, toward the <HI>Euxine,</HI> or <HI>Black Sea,</HI> viz. The Dukedomes of <HI>Mo&s;co, Volodemar, Rezan,</HI> and &s;ome others. Since this it has been enlarg'd by Addition and Con|que&s;t, and is at pre&s;ent under a &s;ingle Government, notwith&s;tand|ing all the Efforts the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and other bordering Countrys have made to hinder the flouri&s;hing of it, and to &s;hare the Frontires among&s;t them; to which end they have made Cruel Wars and Inroads, &s;hedding much Blood, Plundering, Burning, and committing many othet Outrages.</P>
<P>The Principal Provinces of <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> (for &s;o I mu&s;t properly call it) are <HI>Volodemar, Mo&s;cow, Ple&s;co, Ni&s;novogrod, Smolen&s;co, Novogrod-velica</HI> (or <HI>Novogrod</HI> of the Lower Country) <HI>Mo&s;chora, Ro&s;tove, Ghalet&s;a, &V;&s;tuga, Vagha, Cargapolia, Yaru&s;lave, Bealo, Ze|ra, Bezan,</HI> and <HI>Duyna.</HI> The&s;e, with their Dependancies, are ve|ry Large, far exceeding our Shires in <HI>England;</HI> and though they are termed the Natural Provinces, there yet remain others gain|ed by Enlarging their Borders, viz. <HI>Twerra, Youghoria, Condora, Permia, Abdoria, Vedska, Boulghoria, Cheringo, Oudoria,</HI> comprehen|ding <HI>Siberia, Cazan</HI> and <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> with &s;ome others now Depen|dant on the Government of <HI>Mo&s;covy:</HI> So that this &s;pacious Country, from North to South, Mea&s;ur'd from <HI>Cola</HI> to <HI>A&s;tra|can,</HI> which bends &s;omewhat Ea&s;tward, is in Length a|bout 4260 Ver&s;t, a Ver&s;t being &s;omething more than 3 quarters of an Engli&s;h Mile; and Northward beyond <HI>Cola</HI> are other Ter|ritories, but the Extream Cold is there very Oppre&s;&s;ive, &s;o that they are not much Fertil when their Coat of Snow is di&s;&s;olv'd by the Sun in the Four Hot Summer Months. The Breadth from that part which lyeth the farthe&s;t We&s;t from the <HI>Narve</HI> &s;ide to the part of <HI>Siberia</HI> Ea&s;tward, is, in a manner, equal to the Length.</P>
<PB N="3" REF="4">
<P><HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> is Water'd by many large Rivers, mo&s;t of them, when the Weather is open being Navigable, &s;ome by le&s;&s;er and &s;ome by larger Ve&s;&s;els that procure a con&s;iderable Trade, but in the Ridged Sea&s;on they are frozen over &s;o that Sleads and Carriages pa&s;s on them from place to place, they abound in Fi&s;h, and the <HI>Volga</HI> is famous for the great quantity of <HI>Sturgeon</HI> taken in it. It is about 2800 Ver&s;t in length, an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Mile in mo&s;t places over, and empties its Waters into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, running by <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> and other Towns of Note, to which it brings a con|&s;iderable Trade. The other Rivers of Note, are the <HI>Bori&s;thenes,</HI> that divideth the Country from <HI>Lithuania,</HI> and falleth into the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea. The <HI>Tanais,</HI> or <HI>Don,</HI> the Antient boundary be|tween <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> falling into the great Lake of <HI>Moeotis,</HI> by the City of <HI>Azou, Duyna</HI> falling unto the Bay of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> Northward, and to be brief, a great many more, as <HI>Mo&s;cow</HI> running thorough the City of that Name, and about ten others very large, be&s;ides &s;maller Streams, the lea&s;t for length and breadth comparable to the River of <HI>Thames;</HI> and from the&s;e proceed many Branches; &s;o that take the Country in general, it is as well Watered as can be de&s;ired, and accomodated with &s;everal good Ports and Havens.</P>
<P>The Soile of this Spacious Country cannot be rea&s;onably ex|pected, no more than others, Fertil in all places alike, and in &s;ome parts particularly, by rea&s;on of its Northern Situation, lying from 33 to 69 degrees and &s;ome Minutes North Latititude: Yet is it wonderful to &s;ee how God has ordered things here to the Advantage and for the Sub&s;i&s;tance of the Inhabitants. The Earth, for the mo&s;t part, is of a &s;light Sandy Mould, but not a|like for producing &s;uch things as &s;pring up Northwards, towards St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> and <HI>Cola,</HI> and North-Ea&s;t towards <HI>Siberia,</HI> there is an indifferent Sterility, the Country there being full of De&s;arts and va&s;t Forre&s;ts, by rea&s;on of the extreamety of the Climate in the colder Sea&s;on; but from the <HI>Volga,</HI> which lyes almo&s;t 1700 ver&s;t from the Port of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> down towards <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> and &s;o the Southern parts that border on the <HI>Crimee,</HI> that contains near the like &s;pace, the Country is very Fruitful in the proper Sea&s;on, yeilding Pa&s;ture, Corn, Flowers, plea&s;ant Fruits, and Woods in great plenty; and &s;o it is between <HI>Rezan</HI> and <HI>Novogrod</HI> that lyes South-Ea&s;t from <HI>Mo&s;cow</HI> and other parts, as between <HI>Mo&s;cow</HI> and <HI>Smolensko,</HI> that lyes South-We&s;t towards <HI>Littuania;</HI> in&s;omuch that one would wonder to &s;ee the great alteration be|tween
<PB N="4" REF="5"> Winter and Summer in <HI>Mo&s;covy.</HI> In the former the whole Country is cover'd by a continual falling Snow, that is &s;ome|times a yard or two in deepne&s;s in the Southern parts, but more exce&s;&s;ive in the North; and the Cold is &s;o extream, that the Rivers and other Waters are Frozen to a va&s;t thickne&s;s, and this u&s;ually continues for five Months, <HI>viz.</HI> from the beginning of <HI>November</HI> till towards the end of <HI>March,</HI> at what time the Suns warm beams returning, the Snow begins to melt away, which makes the face of the Country look very frightful, and the Ways on the Thaw, for a time unpracticable. But then, as it were, on a &s;uddain, the face of Nature is chang'd (for though a little before Water thrown up in the Air would de&s;cend in Ice drops, and any Mettal gra&s;ped fa&s;t in ones hand &s;tick to the Skin and make it bli&s;ter if taken abroad, and many People venturing too far were frozen to death in the Streets, and on their Jorneys in the Sleads.) Now the Woods (that are mo&s;tly of Birch and Firr) give a plea&s;ing &s;ight, the Meddows and Pa&s;tures look green and grow apace, variety of Flowers appear in the Fields, and the Birds make a plea&s;ing Harmony, the Nightingals there in a|bundance have a clearer Note than with us, and this &s;uddain growth of things proceeds from the Benefit of the Snow which lying &s;o long keeps off the Rigour of the Fro&s;t, and di&s;olving &s;o thoroughly, drenches and &s;oaks the Earth, that the Sun coming hot as it were on a &s;uddain into a cold Climate, the Plants and Herbs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> find &s;uch a Nori&s;hment that they &s;ooner &s;hoot forth than in warmer Countrys; and indeed, con&s;idering the pa&s;t cold, the heat is greater than u&s;ually with us in <HI>June, July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> which produces &s;tore of <HI>Aples, Pears, Plums, Cherrys</HI> Black and Red, a Fruit like a <HI>Musk-Mellion</HI> but more plea&s;ant in ta&s;t; <HI>Cucumbers, Gowrds, Ra&s;ps, Strawberrys, Hurtle-berrys</HI> and many o|ther Berrys; al&s;o <HI>Wheat, Rye, Barley, Pea&s;e, Buskway, P&s;nytha,</HI> ta&s;ting &s;omewhat like <HI>Rice,</HI> and &s;ometimes they have &s;uch plenty that Wheat is &s;old at two <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pence a Bu&s;hel, the <HI>Rye</HI> is &s;ow'd before the Fro&s;t, all other Grain for the mo&s;t part the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> but the Northern parts are u&s;ually &s;erved in a great de|gree by the Southern with Corn as being more Steril.</P>
<P>This Country above others is noted for Rich <HI>Furs</HI> which they get by hunting divers creatures, as al&s;o <HI>Hides, Tallow, Wax, Honey, Flax, Hemp, Tar,</HI> and other valuable Commoditys.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Cities and Towns of <HI>Mo&s;covy,</HI> their Situation, Fortificati|on, Manner of Building. The Di&s;covery of the North-ea&s;t Pa&s;|&s;age by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> their Factory Setled at <HI>Arch-Angel,</HI> &amp;c. The Populou&s;ne&s;s of the Country, con&s;idering the Wa&s;ts in it: The Danger of Wild Bea&s;ts, and the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Na|tives.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>OF the Creatures of this Country I &s;hall Treat particu|larly in due place; But now pur&s;uing the Method I propo&s;e to lay down, The next thing that offers is the Cities, Towns, and the like, that Adorn and Beautify the Coun|try, and tho&s;e of Note are,</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;cow</HI> the Metropolis, from which the Country at pre|&s;ent &s;eems to take its Name, as that City does from the Ri|ver, on who&s;e Bounds it &s;tands: It is about 12 Miles in com|pa&s;s, and may contain about 41500 Families, Convents, Chur|ches, and Chappels: The Hou&s;es in general are built with VVood, Plai&s;ter'd with Mortar and Straw, done over with Lime brought from <HI>Smolensko,</HI> &amp;c. and then covered over with Boards and Bark of Trees, which renders them cooler in Summer, and warmer in VVinter, but &s;ubjects them more to Fire, of which they have had many Fatal Experiments; for <HI>An.</HI> 1571. The <HI>Tartars</HI> Burnt it, and in it de&s;troy'd about 80000 Per&s;ons. <HI>Anno</HI> 1611. the <HI>Polanders</HI> Fir'd it. <HI>Anno</HI> 1676. an Accidental Fire happen'd, and &s;unk 5000 Hou&s;es in the Conflagration: But &s;ince care has been taken to Re|build tho&s;e Deva&s;tations, for the mo&s;t part, and at pre&s;ent 'tis reckon'd among the Flouri&s;hing Cities of Europe, and Guards are appointed to prevent the Progre&s;s of that Raging Element as much as lies in them, for the future pre&s;erving the Building.</P>
<P>The Churches and Hou&s;es of the Per&s;ons of Quality are Built with Stone and Brick; &s;ome of the Principal Churches Cover'd with Guilt Copper, or Tin, and Adorn'd with many Large Globes of the &s;ame Mettal. There is a Bell Rai&s;ed on a Tower, I conceive the Large&s;t in the World,
<PB N="6" REF="6"> for it is held to Weigh 176 Tun, though it has been Clip|ped, and &s;ome Tuns of Mettal taken from it to make it &s;ound the better, it is 24 Foot in height, and the Clapper 21 Foot. By pulling the Clapper, and &s;triking again&s;t the &s;ides it is Rung on particular occa&s;ions. The Form of this Great City is in a manner Round, with Three Strong Walls Circling the one within the other, the Streets lying between, whereof the Inmo&s;t Inclo&s;ure in the Heart of the City, is all accounted the <HI>CZAR,</HI> or Great Duke's Ca&s;tle; and the River Accommodates it with a Sufficiency of Water, &s;tore of Fi&s;h, and other Provi&s;ions. The Ca&s;tle is Four-&s;quare, Situate on a Hill Two Miles about, with Brick-walls very high, and a va&s;t Thickne&s;s; it has Sixteen Gates, and as many Bulwarks: The Chief Markets are kept here, and on the River, when it is Glaz'd with Ice, this River enclo&s;es the Ca&s;tle on the South-we&s;t-&s;ide, and in it are Nine Fair Chur|ches with Guilt Spires.</P>
<P>The next City of Note is <HI>Novograde,</HI> but not &s;o Stately as <HI>Mo&s;cow.</HI> The Hou&s;es are Built with Timber Layed-in, and Fa&s;ten'd with Dents, or Notches; and &s;o fa&s;ten'd together holds well. The Streets, in &s;tead of Paving, are Planked with Firr, and other Timber very neatly, of which Provi|dence has plentifully &s;tor'd them, &s;o that a Hou&s;e may be Built for a very little matter, as 20 or 30 Rubbles. This City Boa&s;ts of the Fam'd Story of the <HI>Scythian</HI> Bondmen, who Rebelling again&s;t their Ma&s;ters, and Seazing the City, their Effects, Wives, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in their Ab&s;ence, and Overthrowing them on their Return, in a Bloody Battel; were, at length, never|thele&s;s Di&s;comfited and brought under by their Ma&s;ters coming upon them only with Hor&s;e-whips, which put them in Mind of the Chain of Servitude they had &s;o lately broken, and con&s;equently Terrifi'd them into Obedience; and, upon this Account they have a Coine bearing the Impre&s;&s;ion of a Hor&s;eman, &s;haking a VVhip at a Flying Slave, Currant all over <HI>Mo&s;covy.</HI></P>
<P>The other Citys of great note are <HI>Ro&s;tove, Volodomar, Smolen|sko, Ple&s;co, Yaru&s;lave, Vologda, Peri&s;lave, Ni&s;novogrod, A&s;tracan, Cargapolia, Columna, V&s;tiue, Cazan, Golmigreo,</HI> and of the&s;e <HI>A&s;tra|can, Yaru&s;lave,</HI> and <HI>Cazan,</HI> have the precedency by rea&s;on of their convenient Situation on the borders &s;o commodiou&s;ly near the <HI>Volga. Yaru&s;lave</HI> exceeds the re&s;t for (be&s;ides the plenty of
<PB N="7" REF="6"> Pa&s;ture and Corn the Soile yeilds) it has a great Trade by the River, being ple&s;antly Situated on a high Bank overlooking it, and from its Situation it &s;eems to take its Name, for that in the <HI>Ru&s;s</HI> Language &s;ignifies a fair Bank, though they boa&s;t it from <HI>Vlademira</HI> Surnamed <HI>Yaru&s;lave,</HI> who Marry'd the Daughter of <HI>Harold</HI> King of <HI>England,</HI> by the Mediation of <HI>Sueno</HI> the <HI>Dane, An.</HI> 1067.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THeir Religion properly is that of the <HI>Greek Church,</HI> dif|fering in many things from the <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Reformed Churches;</HI> their Service is in their own Language; they Receive the <HI>Euchari&s;t</HI> in both Kinds, ob&s;erve Four Lents, and have Service Daily in their Churches. They have many Mona&s;teries Po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by Monks and Fryars, which have con&s;iderable Reve|nues in Land and Hou&s;es belonging to them, and likewi&s;e deal in Merchandi&s;e: When two Friends meet in the <HI>Ea&s;ter</HI> Holy Days, they, in a Solemn manner, joyn Hands, one of them there|upon &s;aying, <HI>The Lord is Ri&s;en:</HI> Then the other An&s;wers, <HI>It is &s;o of a Truth,</HI> and then they Ki&s;s. They have a Metropolitan, or Patriarch, who is in High E&s;timation among them, and Reve|renc'd as the <HI>Pope</HI> among the <HI>Roman Catholicks;</HI> they have a Ve|neration for our <HI>Lady,</HI> St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> and other Saints.</P>
<P>Their manner of Wooing is but &s;hort; for when they make Love, the Man &s;ends Pre&s;ents to the Woman, and &s;he Accept|ing them, the Match is &s;oon Agreed; but if they are return'd, it is a &s;ign &s;he likes not the Party that makes the Proffer; and among other Pre&s;ents &s;ometimes a Whip is &s;ent, to let the Woman know what &s;he has to tru&s;t to if &s;he be di&s;obedient, or break her Marriage Vows; and for the generality, they are &s;o far from re&s;enting it as an Affront, that when Marry'd, the Wife Loves her Husband the better if &s;ometimes he Corrects her; and concludes, he Loves her not, if he altogether declines it: But this prov'd fatal once to an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Shoo|maker, who Marrying a <HI>Ru&s;s</HI> Woman, and &s;ettling in that Country, thinking to gain her Love to a high pitch this way, upon being inform'd that her peevi&s;hne&s;s proceeded from the want of it, he &s;o Over-loaded her with his Kindne&s;s, that &s;he dy|ed, for which he lo&s;t his own Life by the hand of an Executio|oner. The Women indeed are very Obedient to their Husbands, and the better &s;ort e&s;pecially &s;eldom &s;tir abroad but on parti|cular
<PB N="10" REF="8"> occa&s;ions&mdash; And now as to their Marriages, becau&s;e the Ceremony is Novel to us, I &s;hall mention the mo&s;t parti|cular matters relating to it.</P>
<P>The Day being come, the Bride puts on her Head a kind of a Hood made of fine Lawn, or Knit-work, that Veiles her to the Middle, and &s;o with her Friends and the Bridegroom with his, they go to the Church on Hor&s;e-back, though it be near at hand. They Marry with a Ring, and the words of Contract and Cere|mony much agrees with ours. The Ring put on, and the Con|tract Pronounc'd, the Brides hand is deliver'd into the hand of the Bridegroom, &s;tanding this while on one &s;ide of the Altar, or Table, and the Bride on the other. The Knot being thus Knit by the Prie&s;t, &s;he comes about with the Bridegroom to the end of the Table, and falling down at his Feet, knocks her head up|on his Shoo, in token of Subjection and Obedience; then the Bridegroom ca&s;ts the Lap of his Gown over her, &s;ignifying his Duty to Protect and Cheri&s;h her. Then the Brides Father and Friends Bow to the Bridegroom, and his to the Bride, in token of Love and Affinity between the Two Kindreds. This done, the Bridegroom's Father delivers the Prie&s;t a Loaf of Bread, who pre&s;ently returns it, upon a Solemn Promi&s;e that the Dowry &s;hall be deliver'd at the Day Appointed, and that Friend&s;hip &s;hall continue between one Kindred and another: &s;o the Bread is broken, and they eat it among&s;t them, to te&s;tifie their True and &s;incere Meaning for performing the Charge and Promi&s;e, and thenceforth to become as Crums of one Loaf, or Men of one Table.</P>
<P>They u&s;e <HI>Divorce</HI> among them, and it is often practic'd on &s;len|der pretences. For a Man may go to a Mona&s;tery and &s;have him|&s;elf a Friar, in a Pretended Devotion, and Quit him&s;elf of his Wife, and leave her to her Shifts. Yet this is mo&s;tly among the Vulgar, the Women of Quality are held in more E&s;teem, yet without di&s;tinction they are very obedient, and pay a profound Re&s;pect to their Husbands.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Burials</HI> of their Dead, it is done with much Cere|mony. They put them on New Shooes, and put a Letter in their Hands Directed to St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> intimating the Party to be a <HI>Ru&s;s-Man,</HI> or <HI>Woman,</HI> dying in the True Faith: when the Ground is Frozen that no Spade can enter it, they lay up their Dead in Hou&s;es, which they call God's Hou&s;es, and when the Ground is practicable, they bury them in their Cloaths, cau&s;ing Prayers to be &s;aid over them; and be&s;ide the Rela|tions
<PB N="11" REF="8"> there are other Women Mourners, who are employ'd to that purpo&s;e. They have Great Veneration for the <HI>Cro&s;s, Ima|ges,</HI> and <HI>Holy Water;</HI> once a year the <HI>Rivers</HI> are Hollow'd with much Ceremony by the <HI>Bi&s;hops,</HI> and then there is Great Strugling among the People for the Water, and &s;ome leap into it, though in a bitter Sea&s;on, and Women Dip their Tender Infants, conclu|ding there is now a Great Vertue in it; and often it is Given to the Sick in order to recover them, or clean&s;e them.</P>
<P>They keep many <HI>Vigils,</HI> and other days &s;et apart, and are very Zealous in their way of Wor&s;hip; their Patriarch wears a Globe on his Mitre, &s;eeming to &s;ignifie his Univer&s;ality over the Church. In their Religious Wor&s;hip, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They u&s;e a great many Cere|monies, too many here to enumerate; The vulgar &s;ort little affect Learning, and are not much knowing in the Affairs of other Countrys, bending their Studyes or Indu&s;try on Tillage, Handicrafts, and other Inferiour Offices, little affecting Travel, though their Merchants Journey and Trade in divers Countrys of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> having great advantage in the Latter by rea&s;on of the Commodious Situation of the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, into which the River <HI>Volga</HI> carrys them, falling with &s;uch violence that it keeps its &s;tream for &s;ome Leagues in the Salt Water.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mo&s;covits</HI> are generally very Burley, much affecting a Plump Fle&s;hy Corpulency, and this may happen by rea&s;on of their feed|ing, which they do very plentifully among the better &s;ort, and &s;uch as are able to keep Good Tables, though their Diet is rather much, than over-curious. They commonly begin with a <HI>Chark,</HI> or Small-Cup of <HI>Aquavitae,</HI> which they call <HI>Ru&s;s-wine,</HI> and after that drink not till toward the end of Meals, and then they are not &s;paring. They have variety of Di&s;hes, the fir&s;t are their Bak'd Meats, for Roa&s;t-meat they little affect, and then their Brothes or Pottage; After Dinner they u&s;ually &s;leep on Benches The Drink of the Better &s;ort is <HI>Mead,</HI> but the poorer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> content with a thin Drink, call'd <HI>Quas,</HI> not exceeding our Small Beer, which many Drink.

Their Hou&s;es, by heating their <HI>Peaches,</HI> which are made like <HI>German</HI> Bath-&s;toves, and their <HI>Potlads,</HI> like Ovens, are never without a con&s;iderable heat, though many times they will come out of them Sweating, and &s;ometimes plundge into the Wa|ter when they are foaming-hot, which would certainly kill any but tho&s;e that have Innur'd their Bodies to the two ex|treameties of Heat and Cold, which few or no other Nations do, equal to them.</P>
<P>As for their Habits, they are generally after the <HI>Greek</HI> Fa&s;hion. The better &s;ort go decently and very Richly clad, and their Habit in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;hows a di&s;tinction of degrees by &s;ome or other little variation. They &s;have their heads clo&s;e, unle&s;s fallen under the Princes di&s;plea&s;ure, and then let the hair grow as a Mark of dejectedne&s;s or Sorrow &s;o to have offended as to be out of favour; but their Garments differ in Stuffs, though little in fa&s;hion; the Women affect Rich ones as well as the Men, as Cloath, Rich Furs, Silks, Cloath of Gold, or Interwoven with it, and u&s;ually down to their Ancles or Heels, though their Summer Garments are much lighter than tho&s;e they wear in Winter, the latter being always well lin'd with co&s;tly Furs, as <HI>Black Fox, Ermin, Martin, Grey, Squirel,</HI> &amp;c. of which Creatures, and many others yeilding Furs, they have abundance in the &s;everal Provinces. But the <HI>Mou&s;ic</HI> and his Wife go meanly clad, yet will not be out of Court Fa&s;hion as near as may be; their upper Garments are Cour&s;e Cloath, and their under ones perhaps Sheeps Skin with the Wool on, though &s;o dre&s;s'd that they are very warm and plyable; but this is for Winter, for in the Summer the Man goes in his Shirt and the Woman in a Linnen Garment, called two Shirts.

<P>HAving proceeded thus far in Generals and Particulars Relateing to <HI>Mo&s;covy,</HI> I now come more clo&s;ely to the latter, as to what remains more Materialy to be di&s;|cover'd; and fir&s;t of the Government of the Provinces and Shires, of this large Dominion.</P>
<P>They are properly divided into four parts, which they call <HI>Chetfirds,</HI> or <HI>Tetrearchies,</HI> every part contains divers Shires, and is anex'd to the &s;everal Offices from whence it derives the Name.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> beareth the name of <HI>Po&s;oskoy Chetfird,</HI> or the Jurisdiction of the Office of Amba&s;&s;ages, and the &s;tanding Salary to the Officer is yearly 100 <HI>Rubbles</HI> or <HI>Marks,</HI> be&s;ide great ad|vantages accruing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second</HI> is called <HI>Ro&s;eradney Chetfird,</HI> becau&s;e it is proper to the <HI>Ro&s;erade,</HI> or High Con&s;table, who has a like Sallary with the former.</P>
<P>The <HI>Third</HI> is <HI>Pome&s;lenoy Chetfird,</HI> as appartaining to that Office; and here is kept a Regi&s;ter of all the Lands given by the Prince for &s;ervice to his Noblemen, Gentlemen, and others.

<P N="3">(3.) If within the Province there be any publick Service re|quir'd, as the Publi&s;hing of a Law, or Common Order, by way of Proclamation, Mu&s;tering Soldiers, Collecting Taxes or Impo&s;iti|ons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is proper to them.</P>
<P>The&s;e Dukes and <HI>Dyacks</HI> are appointed by the <HI>CZAR</HI> but for a year, and then at his plea&s;ure he may change them; which is u&s;ually done, unle&s;s by Merrit or Interce&s;&s;ion any are continu'd Longer; and though their highe&s;t Sallary is but 100 <HI>Rubbles per Annum,</HI> yet coming bare into the&s;e places, in one year they very much inrich them&s;elves.</P>

<PB N="15" REF="10">
<P>As for the Courts of Civil Ju&s;tice in <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> for matters of Contract, and others of like &s;ort, be&s;ide the former they are of three kinds, and by way of Appeal one is &s;ubjected to the other; the lowe&s;t of the&s;e appointed for the Ea&s;e of the Subject, is the Office of the <HI>Gubnoy Staru&s;t,</HI> which &s;ignifies in their Language an <HI>Alderman,</HI> and of the <HI>Solsky Staru&s;t,</HI> or <HI>Baylif</HI> of the <HI>Soak,</HI> or <HI>Hun|dred;</HI> the&s;e have power to determine matters within their <HI>Soaks</HI> or <HI>Hundreds</HI> under the Dukes and <HI>Dyacks</HI> of the Province before whom the Cau&s;es may be remov'd if not agreed or determin'd.</P>
<P>The &s;econd is held in the head Towns of the Provinces, Shires, before the Deputies of the Lords of the <HI>Chetfirds,</HI> and from the&s;e they have a Priviledge to Appeal or remove their Cau&s;es to the Third or Chief Court held at <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> where u&s;ually re&s;ide the Officers of the <HI>Chetfrids.</HI> The&s;e are the Chief Ju&s;tices or Judges, every one of them in Civil Matters, that ari&s;e within their &s;everal <HI>Chetfird</HI> or Quarter; and may be either commenc'd originaly be|fore them, or pro&s;ecuted out of the Inferiour Courts of the Shires by way of Appeal.</P>
<P>Their Commencing and Proceeding in Civil Actions is in this wi&s;e; The Plantif delivers his Supplycation, wherein he &s;ets forth the Merrit of his Cau&s;e, or wrong done to him; then, if alow'd, a <HI>Reepis</HI> or Warrant is granted, which he delivers to the <HI>Pre&s;tave</HI> or Serjeant, who hereupon Arre&s;ts the Defendant who mu&s;t put in Suretie to An&s;wer or el&s;e be kept in Cu&s;tody, and often on this account loaden with Irons; when they come before the Judg, the Plantif pleads his own Cau&s;e, and the Defendant make his Defence; as for Attorneys and Councellours they are not known in the&s;e Courts, when the Evidence, if they have any, is heard, Judgment is given, but if the matter remains doubtful, then the Judge demandeth of either party, whom he thinks &s;it, whether he will ki&s;s the <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> upon that which he denyeth or a|voucheth; and he who con&s;ents to do it is carry'd by an Officer to the Church, where he does it in a devout manner, and this is held a very Sacred Oath; and hereupon if it be the Defendant he is declar'd free of the Debt, paying 20 pence charges; but if both demand this priveledg, then they draw Lots, and he that has the be&s;t is only alowed it; and thus by &s;hort proceeding with a little charge the Controver&s;y is ended; but if the Defendant be condem'd and not able to pay, his ca&s;e is mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all I have &s;ay'd of the&s;e Courts, there is yet another &s;uperiour to them; and this is call'd <HI>Zabore,</HI> or the Publick A&s;&s;embly, which properly is term'd a Parliament. The States and Degrees of Per&s;ons that are pre&s;ent, are, 1. The <HI>CZAR.</HI>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the <HI>Millitary Affairs</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;covy,</HI> the Degrees and Order of the Soldiers, Officers. Their Abilities and Warlike Di&s;cipline, and o|ther things at Large relating to Martial Enterprizes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe next thing I &s;hall Treat of is the Millitary Affairs of <HI>Mo&s;covy,</HI> which is a thing very well worth noting; and fir&s;t of their Forces for the War, and Chief Officers.</P>
<P>The Soldiers are call'd <HI>Sinabojarsky,</HI> or the Sons of Gentlemen, being all, or mo&s;tly of that Degree, by virtue of their Military Profe&s;&s;ion; for when they are of years to bear Arms, they come to the <HI>Re&s;erade,</HI> or Great Con&s;table, who, at their reque&s;t, enters their Names, alotting them a Maintainance to &s;upport their Charge, there being Lands A&s;&s;igned for this purpo&s;e, annexed to this Office, which cannot be Alienated, &s;o that there is, as I may term it, a Succe&s;&s;ion of Soldiers, and u&s;ually the whole number in continual Pay is as followeth.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> The <HI>Dworany,</HI> or <HI>Pen&s;ionary-Guards</HI> of the Princes Per|&s;on, who are 15000 Hor&s;emen, with their proper Officers, and are always in Readine&s;s; but of the&s;e there are Three Degrees, who differ as well in E&s;timation, as Wages, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Dworany-Bul&s;hey,</HI> or Head-Pen&s;ioners. The <HI>Serendany Dworany,</HI> or the Middle-Rank of Pen&s;ioners. The <HI>Dyta Boiarsky,</HI> or the Lower Rank. The&s;e have from 100 to 20 <HI>Rubbles per Annum,</HI> le&s;&s;ening according to their Station; one half is payed at <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> and the other by the General in the Field; be&s;ides this, they have pro|portionable Lands Alloted them, from the greate&s;t to the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>There are other Hor&s;emen, to the number of 110, much like the <HI>Roman Praetorian</HI> Soldiers, who have the more immediate care of the <HI>CZAR</HI>'s Per&s;on when he goes the Wars, all of &s;pecial Ac|count for their Tru&s;t and Nobility, which he chu&s;es him&s;elf, and cau&s;es their Names to be Regi&s;tred; and for their Large Reve|nues in Pen&s;ion-places, they are to bring to the Wars 65000 Hor&s;emen, with their Furniture and other Nece&s;&s;aries; and once a Year, if there be no Wars, they are to make their Appearance on the <HI>Tartar</HI> Frontiers, &s;o there &s;eldom fails of being 80000,
<PB N="18" REF="12"> a few more or le&s;s, when they are requir'd to take the Field; and greater Forces are &s;peedily Rai&s;ed on any occa&s;ion out of the &s;upernumerary <HI>Sinabojarsky,</HI> that are not in Pay till call'd upon nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions, and all willingly flock to the Regal Stan|dard, upon the fir&s;t Notice; and if a competent number be want|ing, the Noblemen that hold Lands of the Crown, are to make them up with their Servants and Tenants, call'd <HI>Colophey,</HI> which when the Service is over, lay down their Weapons, and return to their Servil Occupations. Over and above the Hor&s;emen menti|on'd, there are &s;eldom le&s;s than 12000 Foot in Pay, that bear Fire-Arms, or Gunners, called <HI>Strel&s;eys,</HI> and the&s;e are appointed to their &s;everal Po&s;ts, &s;ome to Guard the City of <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> and the Pallace, others are di&s;pos'd of in Garri&s;ons till there be further occa&s;ion for them. There are likewi&s;e in his Service a compe|tent number of Strangers, and the&s;e are <HI>Europeans</HI> of divers Na|tions, being chiefly employ'd again&s;t the <HI>Tartars.</HI></P>
<P>The Commanders in Chief of the&s;e Great Forces are the <HI>Voya|vod Bul&s;haia,</HI> Great Captain, or Lieutenant-General under the <HI>CZAR,</HI> u&s;ually cho&s;en out of the Four Hou&s;es of the Chief Nobi|lity; he has joyn'd with him Lieutenant Generals of great Ex|perience. Be&s;ide, there are Four Officers that have the Mar&s;hal|ing of the Army divided among them, call'd Mar&s;hals of the Field, every one hath his Quarters or fourth part. The fir&s;t is call'd <HI>Prava Polskoy,</HI> or the Right-wing, the &s;econd is <HI>Levoy Pol|skoy,</HI> or the Left-wing. The third <HI>Ru&s;noy Polskoy,</HI> or the broken Band, becau&s;e there are Detachments made from it on any nece&s;|&s;ary occa&s;ion. The fourth <HI>Store&s;hovoy,</HI> or the Warding Band; The&s;e have each Two Mar&s;hals under them, who are to Mu&s;ter and Train the Soldiers, and do Ju&s;tice on Offendors; and the&s;e are commonly cho&s;en out of the 110 I have before mention'd. They receive and deliver Pay to the Army; under them are the <HI>Gulavoy,</HI> or Captains of Thou&s;ands, Five hundreds, and Hundreds. The <HI>Petyde&s;etskoy,</HI> or Captains of Fifty, and the <HI>Decetski&s;s,</HI> or Cap|tains of Tens.</P>
<P>There are, be&s;ide the Lieutenant-General, two other <HI>Voiavods,</HI> one Ma&s;ter of the Ordinance, who hath divers under-Officers ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the Service, and the Walking-Captain, or Scouts-Ma&s;ter, who has under him 1000 Expert Hor&s;emen to go out on Parties, and Spy the Enemy; &s;o that a <HI>Mo&s;covite</HI> Army appears very Formidable: And indeed they have done many brave. Ex|ploits, they have lately taken <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> a very Important place, and the la&s;t Year, in a Set-Battel, Overthrown and Ruin'd a Great Army of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> going compleatly Armed, and

They al&s;o Encamp, Entrench and Lodg Advanta|geou&s;ly, being very patient of Hunger, Thir&s;t and Cold, Obedi|ent to their Officers, and Ready to Charge the Enemy on all occa&s;ions. They had in u&s;e a Moving Ca&s;tle, as they call it, which mainly defended them again&s;t the <HI>Tartars</HI> Arrows, and gave them a more &s;ecure Opportunity to Offend their Enemies. This was Fram'd Wood, carry'd on Numerous Carts, which, up|on Occa&s;ion, was ea&s;ily put together, and made a Standing Wall of Seven Miles, or as few as they thought fit, with Loopholes in it, to di&s;charge their Shot, or dart their Arrows; but I am not well a&s;&s;ur'd, whether they have &s;o cumber&s;ome a Machin now in u&s;e or not, for it is little or no defence again&s;t Great Artillery, which the <HI>Turks,</HI> A&s;&s;i&s;ting the <HI>Tartars,</HI> u&s;e.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Cu&s;toms and Revenues that Maintain &s;o Great a Charge in War and Peace, are very con&s;iderable; and, by a few, one may gue&s;s at the re&s;t. That at <HI>Mo&s;cow</HI> amounted to 12000 <HI>Rubbles</HI> Yearly; <HI>Smolensko</HI> 8000; <HI>Vobsko</HI> 12000; <HI>Novogrod-Veli|ca</HI>

Be&s;ides this, the Province of <HI>Volsko</HI> pays yearly for <HI>Tagla</HI> and <HI>Podat</HI> 18000 <HI>Rub|bles; Novogrod</HI> 35000; <HI>Tor&s;hock</HI> and <HI>Ot&s;er</HI> 8000; <HI>Razan</HI> 3000; <HI>Morum</HI> 12000; <HI>Colmigroe</HI> and <HI>Duyna</HI> 8000; <HI>Vologda</HI> 12000; <HI>Cuzan</HI> 28000; <HI>&V;&s;tiuga</HI> 30000; <HI>Ro&s;tove</HI> 50000.

<P>The former in the Citys are for Cu&s;tom, and the&s;e latter, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Tagla</HI> is a Yearly Impo&s;ition, rai&s;ed on every <HI>Wite</HI> or Mea&s;ure of Grain within the Provinces, gather'd by <HI>Shozen-men;</HI> a <HI>Wite</HI> contains 60 <HI>Chetfrids,</HI> every <HI>Chetfrid</HI> is Three Bu&s;hels En|gli&s;h, or little le&s;s.

The Tithes of <HI>Furs,</HI> and Cu&s;toms on Goods, of Strangers by Navigation, or otherways, very much Encrea&s;e the Revenue, be&s;ide other things and ways to Rai&s;e Money, too Nu|merous to mention; and for the&s;e there are Offices and Officers re&s;pectively appointed, who have con&s;iderable Salarys, &s;o that the Riches of this Large Northern Kingdom appears very great, and the Princes Va&s;t Revenues very difficult to be Summ'd up: And &s;ince I am come to this part of Relation, I &s;hall &s;peak briefly of the <HI>Coine, Weights</HI> and <HI>Mea&s;ures,</HI> that are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in Trade, and vary &s;o much from ours, that &s;o Merchants and Travellers may the better under&s;tand them, when their Occa&s;i|ons, or Curio&s;ity &s;hall make them u&s;eful.</P>
<P>The Merchants Accounts are kept at <HI>Mo&s;cow</HI> the chief City divers ways, as by tho&s;e of <HI>England,</HI> in <HI>Rubbles</HI> and <HI>Pence,</HI> call'd by the <HI>Mo&s;covites Muscofskins,</HI> two hundred of them going to a <HI>Rubble.</HI> The <HI>Duthby Grevens</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;cofskins,</HI> 20 of the latter going to the former, &s;o 10 <HI>Grevens</HI> make the <HI>Rubble,</HI> which is held an im|aginary Coine; for the Currant Mony is the <HI>Capeck</HI> worth a <HI>Stiver Flemi&s;h,</HI> and &s;omething more in value than an <HI>Engli&s;h Peney,</HI> 10 of them make a <HI>Greven,</HI> 3 <HI>Capecks</HI> are call, d an <HI>Altine,</HI> by which Contracts and Bargains are u&s;ually made; 33 <HI>Altines</HI> and one <HI>Capeck</HI> make a <HI>Rubble.</HI></P>
<PB N="21" REF="13">
<P>At <HI>Arch-Angel</HI> there is an <HI>Exchange</HI> practic'd, and the Price of <HI>Ru&s;s</HI> Mony bears as the &s;carcety or plenty will allow. The Re|ceipts begin in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> to return in <HI>London</HI> about the latter end of <HI>December.</HI></P>
<P>The Weights chiefly in u&s;e, are the <HI>Pood,</HI> by which all fine Goods are weighed, as <HI>Beaver, Silk, Wool,</HI> &amp;c. but for gro&s;s Goods they have a Weight call'd the <HI>Berzovet,</HI> accounted 10 <HI>Poods,</HI> or the <HI>Ru&s;s&s;hip-Pound,</HI> computed to be 360 Pound <HI>Averdupois;</HI> &s;o that all Goods bought by this Weight are accounted to be 10 <HI>Per cent</HI> profit; &s;o that many have recon'd Goods &s;o bought to pay the Freight with over-weight, and all Goods bought by the <HI>Pood</HI> to be 10 <HI>Per cent</HI> le&s;s.</P>

<P>They take upon the Coa&s;t abundance of <HI>Seals,</HI> which is done in this manner; they carry their Boats over the Ice to open Water, and finding their haunts where they lye basking on huge Flakes of Ice, in a Sun&s;hiney day coming out of the Sea for that purpo&s;e, they hem them in, with their Boats, and with great Clubs, &s;trik|ing them on the No&s;e quickly kill them; their Skins are good Merchandice, and of their Fat they make a &s;ort of <HI>Redi&s;h Oyle.</HI></P>
<P>There is another Sea-Creature called a <HI>Mor&s;e,</HI> who has Teeth about a foot long, by the help of which he clambers up Rocks to &s;eek for Prey, and for the &s;ake of his Teeth they take him, which exceeds <HI>Ivory,</HI> and are of great e&s;teem among them.

<P><HI>Volodimir</HI> left behind him 11 Sons, among whom he divided his Dominions; but <HI>Jaro&s;laus</HI> one of them, by rea&s;on of a divi&s;ion among them got the &s;ole Government into his hands; and <HI>Volodimir</HI> his Son &s;ucceeded him, holding his Court at <HI>Kiow</HI> on the River <HI>Bori&s;thenes,</HI> and had great Wars much enlargeing his Borders, and was the fir&s;t that had the Title of <HI>CZAR,</HI> or <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> confer'd on him by <HI>Con&s;tan</HI> the <HI>Greek</HI> Emperour, who &s;ent him many Rich Gifts. After him in de&s;cent, were <HI>Vu&s;zevolodus, George, Demetrius.</HI></P>
<P>Then <HI>George</HI> his Son, who in the year 1237 by <HI>Bathy</HI> a <HI>Tartar</HI> Prince, brought <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> under his Subjection, making it Tributary to him; and the <HI>Ru&s;s</HI> &s;ay this <HI>Bathy</HI> was Father to <HI>Tamerlain,</HI> whom they call <HI>Temirkutla.</HI></P>
<P>Then &s;ucceeded <HI>Iaro&s;laus</HI> Brother of <HI>George;</HI> and to him <HI>Alexander</HI> his Son. Then <HI>Daniel</HI> his Son, who fir&s;t made <HI>Mo&s;cow</HI> his Royal Seat, builded the Ca&s;tle, and took on him the Title of great Duke, and was &s;ucceeded by <HI>John</HI> his Son Sirnam'd <HI>Kaleta</HI> or <HI>Scrip,</HI> as the word &s;ignifies, becau&s;e he u&s;ually carryed one about him and dealt his Alms out of it to the poor. He left the Govern|ment to <HI>John</HI> his Brother, and <HI>John</HI> left it to <HI>Demetrius</HI> his Son; who had two Sons <HI>Ba&s;ilius</HI> and <HI>George.</HI> The fir&s;t Reigning had a Son, but doubting his Legitimacy, by rea&s;on of his Wives Incon|tinency, he left his Brother to &s;ucceed him. But <HI>George</HI> dying pre|fered his Nephew, who&s;e Name was <HI>Ba&s;ilius,</HI> before his own Sons <HI>Andrew</HI> and <HI>Demetrius,</HI> which occa&s;ion'd much di&s;turbance in the State, for they wared on their Couzen, took him and put out his Eyes; yet the Nobles kept their Allegiance; and <HI>John Va&s;ilwich</HI> his Son &s;ucceeded him. This was he who by his Prudence and Valour fir&s;t brought the Name of his Country out of ob&s;curity, and made it Renown'd in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> Stileing him&s;elf great Duke of <HI>Volodimir, Mo&s;covy, Novogrod</HI> and <HI>CZAR</HI> of all <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia;</HI> he won <HI>Plo&s;co,</HI> the then only Wall'd City in all <HI>Mo&s;covy,</HI> and &s;hook off the <HI>Tartar</HI> Yoke, doing many other brave Exploits; &s;o that the <HI>Poles,</HI> and bordering Nations on either &s;ide courted his Friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><HI>Gabriel</HI> his Son &s;ucceeded him, who changed his Name to <HI>Ba&s;ilius,</HI> he recover'd a great part of <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> from <HI>Vitoldus</HI> Duke of <HI>Lithuania;</HI> won <HI>Smolensko</HI> and many other Citys, <HI>Anno.</HI> 1514.</P>
<PB N="25" REF="15">
<P><HI>Iuan Va&s;iliwich</HI> his Son, a Child, &s;ucceeded him; but growing up, he &s;tript the <HI>Tartars</HI> out of the Kingdoms of <HI>Cazan</HI> and <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> and took the Princes Captive; he made vigorous Wars in <HI>Livonia</HI> pretending a Right to that Country by In|heritance; and did many other admirable things, but enclining much to oppre&s;s his Nobles, they con&s;pir'd and call'd in the <HI>Cri n Tartars,</HI> who committed great Outrages, Be&s;ieged and burnt the City of <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> and in it about 80000 people peri&s;h'd, mo&s;tly by the Flames. This Prince Reign'd 54 years, he had 3 Sons; in his Reign the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> came the fir&s;t time by Sea into the North parts of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia;</HI> his Elde&s;t Son dyed before him.</P>
<P><HI>Pheodor</HI> his Second Son &s;ucceeding, he was, being a Minor, left under the Tuition of <HI>Boris,</HI> Brother to the Empre&s;s, and <HI>Boris</HI> by the Decea&s;ed's Will adopted third Son to him; and here once for all it will not be ami&s;s to give a brief account of the Ceremony in Crowning this great <HI>CZAR.</HI></P>
<P>Forty days Mourning for his Father expir'd, he came from his Pallace, attended by his Clergy and Nobility, to the Church of <HI>Blaue&s;hin,</HI> or <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s,</HI> and hearing Service there, proceeded to the Church of St <HI>Michael,</HI> then to that of our <HI>Lady,</HI> being the Cathedral. There he was plac'd in a Chair of State, his Robe of Gold-Smiths Work, all Gold, &s;et with Pretious Stones and Pearl. The <HI>Imperial Crown</HI> was then plac'd on his head by the <HI>Metropolitan,</HI> who, in doing it, Read Exhortations to him of Ju|&s;tice and Peaceable Government. Then ri&s;ing he was Inve&s;ted with another Robe much Richer than the former; his Train born up by 6 Dukes, the Staff he held was of a <HI>&V;nicorns-horn,</HI> 3 foot and a half long, curiou&s;ly Poli&s;h'd, and &s;et with Precious Stones; a Globe and 6 Crowns were carry'd before him by Princes of the Blood; His Hor&s;e waited at the Church door, covered with an Embrodery of Pearl, and the Saddle &s;uitable, to the value of 3000 <HI>Rubbles</HI> There was a kind of Bridge made 3 ways, 150 Fathom in length, 3 foot high and 2 Fathom broad, whereon the <HI>CZAR,</HI> with his Train pa&s;&s;ed from one Church to another above the va&s;t throng of People. The Churches were &s;pread with <HI>Cloath of Gold,</HI> and the Porches with <HI>Red Velvet.</HI> The Bridges with <HI>Scarlet,</HI> and <HI>Flannel Cloath,</HI> which the People got among them, when the <HI>CZAR</HI> had pa&s;&s;ed, and a great many new <HI>Coins of Gold and Silver</HI> were thrown among them, from the Church; the Cerimony ended, he return'd to the <HI>Parliament-Hou&s;e,</HI> where a &s;tately Banquet, after the <HI>Ru&s;s</HI> manner was &s;erved up by Noblemen in Plate of <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Silver,</HI> 2 &s;tanding on either &s;ide his Chair with <HI>Battle Axes</HI> of <HI>Gold.</HI> This Triumph la&s;ted a
<PB N="26" REF="16"> Week with many Shows and Pa&s;times; after which Election was made of the Nobles to new Offices and Dignities, and all con|cluded with a peal of 170 Bra&s;s Ordinance, and 20000 Harqui|bu&s;&s;es twice di&s;charged, as he pa&s;s'd with a Train of about 50000 to his Pallace.</P>
<P>This <HI>CZAR</HI> Conquer'd the large Country of <HI>Siberia,</HI> and took the King Pri&s;oner, overawing the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and doing many o|ther great matters: But <HI>Boris</HI> his Guardian a&s;piring to the Throne by Treatchery, fir&s;t made away <HI>Demetrius,</HI> the <HI>CZAR</HI>'s Brother, and then the <HI>CZAR</HI> him&s;elf, and u&s;urp'd the Royal Seat. But a Counterfit <HI>Demetrius,</HI> &s;et up by the <HI>Poles</HI> Invading <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> and every where prevailing, <HI>Boris,</HI> as 'tis thought, Poi&s;oned him|&s;elf; for after a full Meal he dyed &s;uddainly in his Pallace; and his Wife drinking Poi&s;on made her Son and Daughter pledge her, of which &s;he and the former dyed, but the latter only lightly &s;ipping recover'd.</P>
<P><HI>Demetrius Evonowich</HI> hereupon was Proclaim'd and Crown'd, and kept about him <HI>Poli&s;h</HI>-Guards for his &s;ecurety, but had a &s;hort and trouble&s;ome Reign, for being &s;u&s;pected an Im|po&s;ture, the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> Con&s;pired again&s;t him, ru&s;hed into his Pallace before break of day, draged him out of his Bed, and Slew him, with many of his Guards and Favorits.</P>
<P>To him Succeeded <HI>Va&s;ily Evanowich Shusky,</HI> who had been mainly In&s;trumental in his de&s;truction, and had not long be|fore been at the Block for reporting to have &s;een the True <HI>De|metrius</HI> Bury'd; but he was recall'd by him he depos'd, and ad|vanc'd to be the In&s;trument of his Ruin: It's reported the Im|po&s;tor's True Name was <HI>Gryfcha,</HI> the Son of a mean Gentleman. Nor did the New <HI>CZAR</HI> long hold the Throne, for the <HI>Poles</HI> rai&s;ed up another <HI>Demetrius,</HI> who Be&s;ieg'd him in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> and wrought him Great Troubles; &s;o that being hardly pre&s;s'd, he betook him to a Mona&s;tery, and &s;o the <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Army became Ma&s;ter of the City; who having got the Spoil, Quarrel'd with their Up&s;tart <HI>Demetrius,</HI> and he flying to &s;eek Shelter, was &s;lain by a <HI>Tartar</HI>'s <HI>Shusk,</HI> who was carry'd into <HI>Poland,</HI> and there di|ed mi&s;erably in Pri&s;on. Yet the <HI>Poles</HI> were &s;oon after Starved, and driven out of all the places they had Garri&s;on'd in <HI>Mo&s;covy,</HI> and much Confu&s;ion happen'd in this <HI>Interregnum,</HI> till at length ta|king Advice to &s;ettle matters, <HI>Michalowich,</HI> or <HI>Michael Pheodoro|wich</HI> was Cho&s;en <HI>CZAR,</HI> a Youth whom <HI>Shusky</HI> much feared, and had put &s;everal of the Name to Death, upon a Pre&s;age one of that Name &s;hould Succeed him; and having been Rai&s;ed by the Valour of <HI>Pozarsky,</HI> and <HI>Boris Licin,</HI> he made them the Generals
<PB N="27" REF="16"> of his Forces, and Joyn'd with them another Great Commander of the <HI>Co&s;&s;acks,</HI> who had very much A&s;&s;i&s;ted him, and rais'd to Honour many other of his Friends, &s;o that &s;oon after a Peace was Concluded between the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> and <HI>Poles,</HI> partly by the Mediation of King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> he was Elected <HI>Anno</HI> 1615. and Manag'd his Dominions in a more con&s;tant way of Peace with the <HI>Turks, Tartars, Polanders</HI> and <HI>Swedes,</HI> than any of his Predece&s;&s;ors had done before him.</P>
<P><HI>Feodor Alexowitz,</HI> or <HI>Alexis,</HI> Succeeded him, who did ma|ny brave Actions, and &s;ecur'd his Borders again&s;t Invaders, and Reign'd to the Year 1682. Who then dying left Two Sons behind, <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Peter,</HI> who were Joynt-<HI>CZARS</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> till the fir&s;t dying, the Whole Government devolved on the Latter, who now Reigns Succe&s;sfully and Victoriou&s;ly, being a Wi&s;e and Judicious Prince, of a &s;ound di&s;cerning Judgement, Cur|teous and Affable, having Enlarg'd his Territories by the taking <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> and giving the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars</HI> many Overthrows; his Under&s;tanding Refin'd, and much Improv'd by Learning and Travel; The Delight of Princes, and the Joy and Safety of his own People.</P>

<P>The Nobility of <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> are of different Ranks, tho&s;e of the Antient Nobility, and &s;uch as have been rai&s;ed by Favour or o|therways for their Noble Attchievements, <HI>viz.</HI> of four &s;orts, The Chief for Birth Authority and Revenue are call'd <HI>&V;delney Knazey,</HI> that is, the Exempt or Priveledged Dukes.

The Fourth are &s;uch as bear the Name of <HI>Knazey,</HI> or Dukes, but come of the younger Brothers of the Chief Hou&s;es through many de|&s;cents. And thus I doubt not but I have given a Satisfactory Account of this Fam'd Country.</P>
