<P>SInce my E&s;cape from Captivity, and wor&s;e than
<HI>Egyptian</HI> Bondage, I have methinks, enjoy'd a happine&s;s with which my former life was never acquainted; now that after a Storm and terrible Tempe&s;t, I have by Miracle put into a &s;afe and quiet Harbour, after a mo&s;t mi&s;erable Slavery, to the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable and Barbarous of Men; now that I enjoy the immunities and freedom of my Native Country, and the Privi|ledges of a Subject of <HI>England,</HI> altho' my circum&s;tances other|wi&s;e are but indifferent, yet I find I am affected with extraor|dinary emotions and &s;ingular tran&s;ports of joy; now I know what Liberty is, and can put a value and make a ju&s;t e&s;timate of that happine&s;s, which before I never well under&s;tood, which ob|&s;ervation agrees very well with a le&s;&s;on in Morals I remember I have been taught, <HI>viz.</HI> that all Happine&s;s here below is only Re|lative, and has a value only put upon it by Compari&s;on, Riches and Abundance have their Mea&s;ures of good and convenience, from the con&s;ideration of the Mi&s;eries and Inconveniencies that attend Poverty and Want; Health can be but &s;lightly e&s;teemed by him, who never was acqu&aacute;inted with Pain or Sickne&s;s, and Liberty and Freedom are the happine&s;s only valuable by a Re|flection on Captivity and Slavery, they who are unacquainted <PB REF="3"> with, and have no notice of the Mi&s;eries of the latter, will ne|ver put a due Value and con&s;ideration upon the former; of which general Rule, the mo&s;t part of my Country-men, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, are too particular an in&s;tance, who of all the Nations of the Earth are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the greate&s;t Liberty, but lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible of the happine&s;s; Here the Government &s;ecures every Man in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and enjoyment of what Gods ble&s;&s;ing and his own indu&s;try has allow'd; Here even the Poor and Needy, the Impotent, and tho&s;e whom the Hand of God has touch'd, have a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and plentiful provi&s;ion again&s;t all extremities; Here the indu&s;trious Mechanick or Country-Farmer, can &s;it down at his Table better provided than many Barons of <HI>Germany,</HI> Mar|que&s;es in <HI>France,</HI> and Knights in <HI>Spain;</HI> in a word Slavery is &s;o &s;trange a condition to
<HI>England,</HI> that to touch its &s;oil, is <HI>ip&s;o facto Manumi&s;&s;ion,</HI> and the generality of the People have but little heard, and le&s;s under&s;tood the mi&s;erable State which the mo&s;t part of the World is now &s;ubject to, &s;o that the Plenty and great Liberty of the

<HEAD>A True Account of my being taken, and Sufferings during my Captivity.</HEAD>
<P>UPon the <HI>27th.</HI> day of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1684. I
<HI>Thomas Phelps</HI> &s;et fail from the <HI>Downs</HI> in a Ve&s;&s;el called the <HI>Succe&s;s</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> about fourty Tuns, laden with Salt, bound for a place in <HI>Ireland</HI> called the <HI>Ventrey,</HI> where we arrived the <HI>10th.</HI> day of <HI>September:</HI> I &s;tayed there &s;ome while, and kill'd Beaf, de&s;igning for the <HI>Madera's</HI> and
<HI>Mount Surrat;</HI> accordingly on the <HI>20th.</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> I &s;et &s;ail for the <HI>Madera's,</HI> but my de&s;ign was cro&s;t, and my Voyage &s;topt as followeth: Upon the <HI>5th.</HI> of <HI>October</HI> (being then a Hundred Leagues, <HI>We&s;t</HI> off the Rock of <HI>Lisbon)</HI> we &s;aw a &s;ail to windward of us, which immediatly we found to give us chace; we made what &s;ail we could from him, and night coming on, we had, for about Two hours, lo&s;t &s;ight of him, but at the ri&s;ing of the Moon, he got &s;ight of us, and quickly came up with us, hail|ing us whence our Ship, we an&s;wered from <HI>London,</HI> deman|ding the like of him, who made an&s;wer from <HI>Algeir,</HI> and withal commanded us to hoi&s;t out our Boat, which we re|fu&s;ed to do, but we brac'd our head-&s;ailes for him, imme|diatly he &s;ent his Boat towards us, when it was got almo&s;t by our &s;ide, we gave them Three &s;houts, which &s;o &s;urpriz'd them, that they thought it convenient to retire aboard their <PB N="2" REF="4"> <GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="3" REF="4" MS="y"> <GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page"> <PB N="2" REF="5"> own Ship; We were not a little chear'd at their departure and made from them with all the &s;ail we could make, for we had not one great Gun, and as for Powder, I believe one &s;in|gle pound was the outmo&s;t of our &s;tore: In the mean time he was hoi&s;ting in of his Boat, I had got above two miles from him, which made me think I was clear of him, and withal that the Ship mu&s;t be an
<HI>Algerine,</HI> &s;he appearing &s;o great, that, according to the &s;tories in <HI>England,</HI> I thought no &s;uch Ship could belong to
<HI>Sall&eacute;;</HI> But I found my &s;elf within a little while, mightily mi&s;taken, for as &s;oon as his Boat was hoi|&s;ted in, he pre&s;ently &s;etch'd us up again: We had try'd his &s;ailing all ways, but found we could not wrong him any way; &s;o &s;eeing him a &s;tern, and a thing impo&s;&s;ible to lo&s;e &s;ight of us, I put out a light for him, notwith&s;tanding I was po&s;&s;e&s;t at that time (God knows) with fear enough, but I thought, in the Dark, my &s;eeming confidence and re&s;olution might impo&s;e upon him, &s;o as to fancy I was of &s;ome force; And truly afterwards he confe&s;&s;ed to me, that he thought I had &s;ix Guns aboard and that I did intend to fight him.</P>
<P>He kept a &s;tern of me all night, and in the morning he put out
<HI>Turki&s;h</HI> colours, which I an&s;wered with our <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> then he came up, and &s;aw I had no boat in &s;ight, for my boat was &s;tow'd down betwixt decks, he commanded me therefore to brace to my head-&s;ailes, and then he &s;ent his boat to demand my pa&s;s; Aboard he was an antient
<HI>Moor,</HI> who formerly had been a &s;lave in <HI>England</HI> and &s;poke good <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and who was &s;et at liberty by our late Gracious King
<HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>2d.</HI> He &s;eeing us in readine&s;s with what arms we had, ask'd me, if I had a mind to break the Peace, he told me I needed not trouble my &s;elf to keep them out of our Ve&s;&s;el, for none of them could be per&s;waded to come aboard me.</P>
<P>I brought him my Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e-Cocketts, for I had no Pa&s;s: The <HI>Moor</HI> afore&s;aid carried them to the Captain, but
<PB N="3" REF="5" MS="y"> &s;oon after returned, and told me that would not &s;atisfie the Captain, unle&s;s the Ma&s;ter him&s;elf would come; I made an|&s;wer that I would not come, that I had done what I was o|blig'd to by the Articles 'twixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Algiers:</HI> The boat a &s;econd time put away for their Ship, and whil&s;t they were hoi&s;ting in their boat, I made what &s;ail I could, and was got a mile or more from them again, entertaining better hopes than I was in the night before; But as &s;oon as the boat was in and &s;tow'd, the <HI>Moors</HI> made &s;ail and came up with me again, the Captain ordering to tell me, that if I re|fus'd to come a board him, he would come aboard me with his Ship; with that he rang'd up my Weather quarter, I im|mediatly put a &s;tays, which put him into &s;ome confu&s;&s;ion, &s;o that he was forced to put a &s;tays al&s;o: He had then no Gun, which I could perceive, I &s;aw his Ports, and his Wa&s;t was Man-high: As I came about I run under his &s;tern, then bore away right before the Wind, he &s;oon came up with me, but not one &s;hot pas'd all this while, he demanded of me why I clapt a &s;tays for to run a thwart his halfe; I an&s;wered that I doubted he was not of <HI>Algier,</HI> he &s;wore in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to me that he was, el&s;e before this he would have di&s;cover'd him|&s;elf, and withal he told me, that if I did not come aboard, he would &s;traight way &s;ink me, and &s;o he hoi&s;ted out his boat, in the mean time I boar away, but his boat coming up made me bring to again and brace a back; His boat then came a|board, I ask'd this <HI>Moor,</HI> who &s;poke <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> what &s;hip of
<HI>Algiers</HI> this was, he very readily without &s;tammering told me, &s;he was call'd the <HI>Tagerene</HI> young <HI>Canary</HI> Com|mander, I immediatly then went into his boat; &s;o &s;oon as I came aboard, the Captain ask'd me why I was &s;o hard of be|lief, My di&s;tru&s;t was &s;uch then that I pray'd the Captain now that he had me aboard in his power, to re&s;olve me whether he were a <HI>Sall&eacute;-man</HI> or not, he &s;wore to me again that he was of
<HI>Algiers,</HI> and that I &s;hould not be wrong'd; He made <PB N="4" REF="6"> me &s;it down, and caus'd them to &s;et Dates and Figgs before me: A little after the Captain told me that he was made acquainted by his men that they &s;aw two <HI>Portugue&s;es</HI> aboard my Ship, and that he would have them out, and then I &s;hould be gone about my bu&s;ine&s;s, I told him I had none &s;uch aboard, but he would &s;ee them two men, &s;o two men were &s;ent for, after that he told me there were three more and them he mu&s;t have, well to be &s;hort, at la&s;t he was &s;u&s;picious that I was a
<HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> al&s;o, and to convince me that I was one, I found my entertainment pre&s;ently withdrawn? Thus did this faithle&s;s
<HI>Barbarian</HI> &s;erve me, until he had wheadled all my men aboard him except two, and then the valiant <HI>Moors</HI> entred my Ve&s;|&s;el with abundance of courage, heaving the two remaining <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> over the head of the Ve&s;&s;el into the boat.</P>
<P>Thus were we all Strip'd, the Ve&s;&s;el Plunder'd in a mo|ment, which they did re&s;olve to have &s;unk, becau&s;e they were too farr at Sea di&s;tant from their own coa&s;t, but Imme|diatly we &s;aw five &s;ail bearing down upon us, which &s;tartled the <HI>Moors,</HI> putting them into a great fright, obliging them to quit my Ve&s;&s;el with abundance of Beaf and three Boxes of dry goods aboard, which their fear would not give them lea&s;ure to rummage for: In &s;ome &s;mall time the five Ve&s;&s;els di&s;cover'd us, when they came within two Leagues of us, had they bore down afterwards with that re&s;olution, that they threatned before, the Pirate would never have &s;tood to look them in the face, but ala&s;s like di&s;tracted fearful game, every of the five Ships took a &s;everal cour&s;e, and being now night they all e&s;caped.</P>
<P>After that we crui&s;ed about thirty Leagues to the
<HI>We&s;t</HI> of the <HI>Northern Cape,</HI> and &s;o to the
<HI>Burlings,</HI> but no nearer than Twenty Leagues to the &s;hoar, and therefore I imagin there is more &s;afety for &s;mall ve&s;&s;els bound that way, to keep the &s;hore as near as is po&s;&s;ible, for I know certainly they never attempt to come near, but endeavour as much as they can,
<PB N="5" REF="6" MS="y"> to avoid the &s;hoar becau&s;e our Men of War u&s;e to careen at <HI>Lisbon.</HI></P>
<P>I am likewi&s;e pretty well &s;atisfied for that &s;mall time that I was among&s;t them, (altho' it was too long for my profit) that no
<HI>Sall&eacute;-man</HI> will fight a Ship of Ten Guns, which I found true by ob&s;ervation of a Country-man from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> whil&s;t I was aboard: We came up with him and hail'd him, and would have had him put out his Boat, but he refu&s;ed, and withal &s;hew'd him&s;elf ready in his own defence, upon which we were glad to leave him.</P>
<P>So that to &s;atisfie all my Country-men who follow my trade I dare confidently affirm, that if I had a Ship of Ten Guns, and it &s;hould be my fortune to encounter any of the&s;e <HI>Sall&eacute;-rouges,</HI> (who all go under the notion of <HI>Algerines,</HI> who are now at peace with
<HI>England)</HI> I would encourage him to &s;end his boat, by acquainting him that our Ma&s;ter would come aboard and &s;hew his pa&s;s, (which is the thing they aim at) And when the boat was come to my &s;ide, (any man of rea&s;on may judge then whether &s;he were from <HI>Sall&eacute;</HI> or <HI>Al|giers,</HI> but however I would commit nothing &s;hould be judg|ed a breach of the Peace,
'twixt <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Algiers)</HI> I would heave in a Grapling and &s;ecure the men, all &s;ave two, whom I would permitt to return aboard and bring me a Chri|&s;tian, or el&s;e aver my Pa&s;s, if they will not do that, I am then &s;atisfied what he is, and think my &s;elf obliged to de|&s;end my &s;elf from Slavery, but this I am very confident of, that he will never &s;tay to di&s;pute the ca&s;e afterward.</P>
<P>About a fortnight after I was taken, we met one <HI>Samuel Crampton</HI> who came from <HI>Faro,</HI> and whom we &s;oon took without any re&s;i&s;tance. The week following we took a &s;mall Ketch come from
<HI>Cales,</HI> laden with Sherry and Rai&s;ies and bound for <HI>Limrick, John Elliot</HI> Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The number of us Chri&s;tians taken aboard the Three Prizes was Twenty five, be&s;ides Twelve which were aboard <PB N="6" REF="7"> the Pirate, in all Thirty &s;even; We who were newly taken were kept in Irons in the Hold.</P>
<P>After the taking of the&s;e Three Ve&s;&s;els the Pirate made all the &s;ail he could for <HI>Sall&eacute;</HI> to &s;ave the &s;pring Tide, which flows at <HI>Sall&eacute;</HI> and <HI>Mamora S S W</HI> about Thirty Leagues: To the <HI>Northward</HI> of <HI>Sall&eacute;,</HI> we met a Fleming who came from <HI>Sall&eacute;,</HI> and told our Commander that the
<HI>Engli&s;h-men</HI> of War were at <HI>Tangier</HI> then, attending Captain
<HI>Nichola&s;on,</HI> which cau&s;ed us to bear directly for
<HI>Sall&eacute;</HI> and fell in directly with the Ca&s;tle, where were no
<HI>Engli&s;h-men</HI> of War, ac|cording to the Advice.</P>
<P>On the Bar of <HI>Sall&eacute;</HI> there run a great Sea, which obliged us to come to an Anchor near the <HI>Bar,</HI> where we rid Six hours; then were we poor Chri&s;tians all let loo&s;e from our Iron|&s;hackles, wherein we had been confin'd for Twenty days preceeding: the Captain &s;ent the Boat, as near the Shore to the <HI>South</HI> of the <HI>Bar,</HI> as po&s;&s;ibly he could, to enquire what News, there they were acquainted that they might &s;afely come in the next high Water: whil&s;t the Boat was gone a Shore, the Moors, we ob&s;erv'd, fell all fa&s;t a &s;leep, the Cap|tain al&s;o, with his Head over the Rail, upon the half-Deck &s;eem'd deeply ingag'd: This opportunity me thought was very inviting, I made a propo&s;al of it to my fellow Slaves, and undertook to do the Captains bu&s;ine&s;s my &s;elf: The Chri&s;tians were forward enough to comply with the motion, and Eleven of the Twelve, (which were Slaves retain'd in the Ship before our being taken) they al&s;o were willing, if the Twelfth who was Steward in the Ship would have con&s;ented, but this &s;neaking varlet prov'd recreant, and for fear of him the other Eleven turn'd al&s;o Renegadoes to this Heroick and Chri&s;tian re&s;olution; I had a mind to have di&s;patcht this troubler of our peace out of the way fir&s;t, but the fear that his fellow Slaves would have &s;everely re&s;ented it, re&s;train'd my re&s;olution; the Slaves Name was
<HI>Will. Robin&s;on,</HI> he pro|fe&s;&s;ed <PB N="7" REF="7"> him&s;elf a Chri&s;tian in words, but in deed we found more civility from the Moors than him.</P>
<P>At Four in the Afternoon, we weighed Anchor, and &s;tood in for the <HI>Bar,</HI> we &s;truck Twice going over, but without any dam|mage; it was upon the Fir&s;t day of <HI>November,</HI> after we had helped to moor our Ship, at Night we were all carried a&s;hore, and conveyed to our Lodging, which was an old Stable, but without Litter or Straw, having nothing &s;ave the bare dirty Ground for our Bed or Pillow; the next Day we were all carryed aboard the Ship to Unrigg her, and get out her Bal|la&s;t, which we did; about Four in the Afternoon, I was &s;ent for a&s;hore to come to the Governour, who pa&s;&s;ed his &s;entence on us Three Ma&s;ters, that we &s;hould go to his Hou&s;e, and there remain, until we were &s;ent for by the King; we remained at his Hou&s;e Ten days, where our daily employment was to Grind the Corn for the u&s;e of his Family; at length there came an Order for us, and all the re&s;t of the Chri&s;tians to be carryed to the King, who&s;e Ordinary and then Re&s;idence was at <HI>Machane&s;s,</HI> a place which this pre&s;ent Emperour has &s;et his Fancy upon, and be&s;tows mo&s;t of his care, and employs all Chri&s;tian Slaves in Building there; it is di&s;tant from <HI>Sall&eacute;</HI> about Seventy Miles, and from <HI>Fez</HI> Thirty.</P>
<P>In our Journy thither, I cannot forget our Captains extra|ordinary civility, in Accommodating us &s;ometimes with Bor|ricoes to ride on, &s;o that in Two days and a half we arrived thither: The Fir&s;t night we were not brought before our great Ma&s;ter, but the following our Captain pre&s;ented us before him, and withal &s;ome <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Plate, which was taken in Mr. <HI>Crampton's</HI> Ve&s;&s;el; as the Captain gave it into his Hand, the &s;urly Tyrant with a &s;eeming &s;corn and di&s;dain heav'd it again&s;t the Wall, which was the fir&s;t Action I ob&s;erv'd, and did a little di&s;cover the temper of my new Patron <HI>Muley I&s;h|mael</HI> Emperour of
<HI>Morocco</HI> and <HI>Fez,</HI> &amp;c. He ordered us to be &s;ent among&s;t the re&s;t of our fellow Slaves; as we went we <PB N="8" REF="8"> were entertain'd with the civilities of the place, and wel|comed by the joyfull acclamations and complements of the Moors kicking and &s;lapping us all along, which appeared very uncouth to me, who was but a Stranger, but that Night my fellow Captives allayed my wonder, by acquainting me, that what had pa&s;t was nothing, it was only a &s;utable Pro|logue to all the Tragical &s;ufferings that Chri&s;tians mu&s;t en|dure there whil&s;t they are Slaves, which were &s;o dreadful, that I could willingly, that very Night have ventured my Life to endeavour an e&s;cape; they Painted out to me the Tyran|nical humour of the Emperour, both towards the Chri&s;tians and Natives, in &s;uch Bloudy Colours,
<HI>viz.</HI> how they had &s;een him Butcher many Thou&s;ands with his own hands, how that none can be &s;ecure in his pre&s;ence for that the varying of a look, a &s;mall &s;pot in the Garment, or any &s;uch incon&s;iderable circum&s;tance, will rai&s;e &s;uch a caprice in the Emperours Nod|dle, without any other provocation, as to endanger all the Heads before him, and it is very rare if the company e&s;cape with One or Two only Beheaded, or Lanced through the Body.</P>
<P>The Second day after my arrival thither, I &s;aw him Lance Seven and twenty <HI>Negroes</HI> one after another, and every Day after, until
<HI>New-years-day,</HI> (when he parted to <HI>Santa Cruz</HI> with his Army) I either &s;aw or heard of his inhumane, but yet, through cu&s;tom, to him Natural Barbarities, Killing and Dragging, but this latter is a piece of re&s;pect ob&s;erved only to Minions and Favourites, Vice-kings and Alcaids; yea his Women are not able by all their Charms to avoid his Fury, but are more the objects of his implacable rage than any other pa&s;&s;ion: I have been &s;everal times in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> and have &s;een and heard of divers Inhumanities and cruelties pra|cti&s;ed there, I have al&s;o read in Books, and have heard Lear|ned men di&s;cour&s;e of the <HI>Sicilian</HI> Tyrants and Roman Em|perours, but indeed I forget them all, they are not to be
<PB N="9" REF="8"> named in compari&s;on with this Mon&s;ter of
<HI>Africk,</HI> a com|po&s;ition of Gore and Du&s;t, whom nothing can attone but humane Sacrifices, and to be in who&s;e court it is much more eligible to be his Hor&s;e or his Mule, than to be his <HI>Privado</HI> or Wife of his bo&s;ome, from who&s;e greate&s;t kindne&s;s my good God ever defend me, for his mercies are cruel: Yea even <HI>Hamed Ben Haddu</HI> who was his Emba&s;&s;adour here in <HI>England</HI> Three years ago, altho' he was received and entertain'd here with extraordinary civilities, and carre&s;s'd every where by all the endearments of kindne&s;s and re&s;pect, and altho' by his finene&s;s and Moori&s;h &s;ubtilty, he &s;tole into the Inclinations of the well-meaning and good natur'd <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;o that he obtain'd the reputation of Ingenuity and candour, Yet the Dog has return'd to his Vomit, and by woful experiment, all my Country-men, who come under his power, find him a har&s;h and cruel Ma&s;ter, who manag'd his affairs here with deep di&s;&s;imulation, and now improves his knowledge of <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> affairs, to the detriment and ruin of all the Kings Sub|jects, with whom he has to do; if it be his fortune to meet or pa&s;s by any of them, his cu&s;tom is (as all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> can atte&s;t) to &s;alute them with a devili&s;h Cur&s;e to the be&s;t of my remembrance expre&s;t thus, <HI>Alli Haztebuck,</HI> i. e. <HI>God roa&s;t your Father:</HI> he is indeed reckoned a great Ma&s;ter in the art of Di&s;&s;imulation and Flattery, a qualification, which &s;eems very requi&s;ite in a Courtier of &s;uch a Barbarous Bloody Tyrant as his Ma&s;ter is.</P>
<P>But to proceed, my fellow Chri&s;tians in the next place, &s;hewed me the &s;taff of their life there, <HI>i. e.</HI> their Bread, which was of Barley, but black, and withal it &s;tunk, the Corn being kept Seven years under Ground before us'd, one Days allowance if &s;old, would yield only Nine Fluces, which a|mount to Three Farthings; Fle&s;h is cheap, both Mutton and Beef, but Mony is &s;carce, Two pounds and a half of Beef, are ordinarily &s;old for a Blankil, <HI>i. e.</HI> Two pence half-peny, <PB N="10" REF="9"> and Two pounds of Mutton at the &s;ame rate; good white-Bread is al&s;o plentiful, half as cheap as in <HI>England;</HI> but what is this to the Slaves who have-not a Farthing, and not a bit is allow'd us without Mony; I am confident there is many a Chri&s;tian there, who hath not ta&s;ted a mor&s;el of Fle&s;h in Five Months time.</P>
<P>The Country is a plea&s;ant Champion Country, very Fruit|ful, well Watered, productive of all &s;orts of Fruit in plenty; we Chri&s;tians who arrived la&s;t, were excu&s;ed for Two days from Labour, only we were in&s;tructed in our deportments to our <HI>Negro-</HI>Taskma&s;ters, who afterwards gave us &s;evere cha|&s;ti&s;ment for our mi&s;takes and lap&s;es: our Work and Daily Labour was continually Building of Hou&s;es and Walls; the Materials and Method is very Forreign and will appear &s;trange to my Country-men here; there are Boxes of Wood of dimen&s;ions according to plea&s;ure, the&s;e we fill with Earth powdred and Lime, and Gravel well beat together and tempered with Water, and when full, we remove the Box according to order, and withdraw the Box Planks, and leave this matter to dry, which then will acquire an incredible hardne&s;s, and is very la&s;ting, for we have &s;een Walls of &s;ome Hundred years &s;tanding as we were informed, and all that time has not been able to do them any prejudice.</P>
<P>The King him&s;elf (what the rea&s;on of his humour may be I never had the curio&s;ity to ask him) will &s;ometimes vouch|&s;afe to work in the Lime and Durt for an hour together, and will bolt out an encouraging word to the Slaves them, <HI>viz.</HI> as I remember, <HI>Liferus,</HI> that is,
<HI>God &s;end you to your own Countries,</HI> but I judge, he either does not &s;peak from his Heart, or el&s;e he hopes God will not an&s;wer the Prayers of &s;uch a wicked wretch; with this &s;ort of Labour I made a &s;hift to pa&s;s away all the Winter, and indeed without a quible, I had no other &s;hift or &s;hirt, only the Charity of my fellow Slaves, who were better provided, accommoda|ted <PB N="11" REF="9"> me with a covering from the Cold, which el&s;e would have endangered my life.</P>
<P>The Reader, I &s;uppo&s;e, will not think it &s;trange, if I was di&s;&s;atisfied and very weary of my condition, and therefore I did often rummage all my thoughts, for &s;ome expedient to ea&s;e me of this accur&s;ed way, not of Living, but Starving and Dying daily: My mind did often flatter me with the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ibility of Liberty by running away, and &s;o con|fident I was, that I di&s;covered my intentions to &s;everal Chri&s;tians, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e of my near acquaintance, who by no means could be induc'd to hear the difficulties and dangers that attended &s;uch a re&s;olution: In the mean time my Friends in <HI>England</HI> had taken &s;ome care for my Ran|&s;ome, and had given order to Mr <HI>Luddington,</HI> an
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant in <HI>Barbary,</HI> to endeavour my relief if One hun|dred and fifty Pounds would effect it, which Sum Mr. <HI>Lud|dington</HI> acquainted me, he was ready to disbur&s;e, if I could cut, (that is, agree with my Patron for my Ran&s;ome) for Six hundred or Seven hundred pieces of Eight: I profered the &s;aid Sum, but it would not be accepted; upon which I lookt upon my condition as de&s;perate, my forlorn and langui&s;h|ing &s;tate of life without any hopes of Redemption, (which on|ly could &s;upport our Spirts in the mid&s;t of &s;uch great affli|ctions, and Bondage to tho&s;e upon whom God and Nature &s;eems to have impre&s;t characters of Slavery to the re&s;t of Mankind) appeared far wor&s;e than the terrours of a mo&s;t cruel Death, I &s;et up then my fixt and unalterable re&s;olution to e&s;cape whatever fate attended it, leaving the event to providence; I had more than conjecture, that pre&s;ent Death was to be the reward of my endeavours if I were retaken, for Three <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who &s;ome Two Months before were taken, making their e&s;cape, the King cau&s;ed them to be brought be|fore him, and with his own hands prov'd their Butcher, and Executioner, which cruel proceedings did wholly di&s;hearten <PB N="12" REF="10"> the poor Spirited Chri&s;tians, and bani&s;hed all &s;uch re&s;oluti|ons quite out of their minds: At length I opened my mind to Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> (who about a Year and a half before, had made an unlucky attempt to run away, but being brought back he had the Ba&s;tinado in &s;uch a &s;ort that he could not work for a Twelve Month, having Irons continually upon his Leggs) but notwith&s;tanding, &s;uch was his love of Chri|&s;tian Liberty, that he freely told me, that he would adven|ture with any fair opportunity; after I had him thus engag'd by his promi&s;e, I gave him no re&s;t, until we had pitch'd upon a Day; we al&s;o took into our Cabal and &s;hare of our For|tunes, Two <HI>Bri&s;tol-men,</HI> who were ready at an hours war|ning, when we appointed.</P>
<P>There are at <HI>Machane&s;s</HI> at pre&s;ent about Eight hundred Chri&s;tians of all Nations, Two hundred and &s;ixty whereof are
<HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;everal of which have tendred Mony for their Ran&s;om, &s;ome Seven hundred, &s;ome Five hundred pieces of Eight, &s;ome more, &s;ome le&s;s, but the King &s;till put them off with this, that he would clear none particularly, but that they &s;hould go all together.</P>
<P><HI>January</HI> the Fir&s;t, The King &s;et forward towards
<HI>Santa Cruz,</HI> with an Army of about Sixty thou&s;and men, de&s;igning to quel his Nephew, who had made a formidable In&s;urrection again&s;t him, in that part of his Dominions: We Chri&s;tians could not Inform our &s;elves of the certain proceedings of the&s;e Armies, neither did we much care, fight Dog, fight Bear, but this we learnt, that it will be Two or Three years before his return, and it is not to be &s;uppos'd that any particular Chri&s;tian will be releas'd until he return; be&s;ides, there is no hopes to be laid upon the mo&s;t &s;olemn word and prote&s;ta|tion of this &s;warthy Infidel <HI>Muley I&s;mael,</HI> for, as I have been inform'd, about Four or Five years ago, by an agree|ment with Collonel <HI>Kirk,</HI> all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;laves were to be &s;et at liberty at the rate of Two hundred pieces of Eight a
<PB N="13" REF="10"> head, and the bargain was &s;o far &s;truck, that the Chri&s;tians were got a Mile out of Town, But the accur&s;ed Jews, (the &s;tench and pe&s;t of the Nations of the Earth, Malicious to all Man-kind and loath&s;ome and abominable whereever they come, who not only have the blood of the Saviour of the World lying upon their heads, but are accountable for the blood of many Thou&s;ands of his Members which they daily &s;hed) The&s;e wicked Enemies of Chri&s;tianity, brought back the&s;e poor Chri&s;tians into the hou&s;e of bondage thus, they pro&s;&s;ered the Emperour as much mony as the King of <HI>Eng|land</HI> tendred for the Chri&s;tians Ran&s;ome, if &s;o be he would only lend them for a while, to build a City for the Jews, and then they &s;hould be re&s;tor'd to the King; The covetous Ty|rant &s;oon clos'd with the&s;e advantageous terms, and the Chri|ans were turn'd over to the Jews, who imploy'd them Three years in building a City, but when fini&s;h'd, &s;ee the ju&s;t Judg|ment of God! The Jews were turn'd out, and forc'd to give place to the Moors: Another remarkable &s;tory concerning the Jews I cannot but in&s;ert upon this occa&s;ion: About Three years ago, Mr. <HI>Bowrey</HI> of
<HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> was, with Twenty &s;ail more, taken by the
<HI>Sall&eacute;-men, Bowrey</HI> had a parcel of Soap in his Ship, which then did belong to the King; <HI>Ben Haddu</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;adour in <HI>England</HI> de&s;ir'd to buy this Soap of the King, but a Jew out bid him, and &s;o had the Soap, for which dea|ling the Amba&s;&s;ador kept a grudge in his mind again&s;t the Jews, and was reveng'd on them, after this manner, whil&s;t I was there. He inform'd the King that the Jews had im|pos'd upon him and couzen'd him of Fifty thou&s;and pieces of Eight in the matter of the Soap, upon which the King clapt up Ten of the chief Jews in Pri&s;on, until they &s;hould either pay the &s;aid Sum, or el&s;e re&s;tore the Soap, which it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, hath been fold in Chri&s;tendom Two years ago.</P>

<P>AFter a &s;erious con&s;ideration, finding that no proffers for my redemption would be accepted, I committed the conduct of my proceedings to Almighty providence re&s;olving to make an E&s;cape in company of Three more,
<HI>Edmund Baxter, Anthony Bayle,</HI> and <HI>James Ingram.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>29th.</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> agreeing with our Guardian-Moors for a <HI>Blankil, (i. e.) 2d. ob.</HI> a piece, we had the liberty to be excus'd from work that day, we went there fore to the Town of
<HI>Machane&s;s,</HI> and having but a &s;mall &s;tock of ca&s;h about us,
<HI>viz.</HI> nine <HI>Blankils,</HI> we laid it out in Bread, and two &s;mall Bullocks bladders, with a little Burdock to carry Water in.</P>
<P>About Three of the clock in the Afternoon we began our journey de&s;igning to go as far as an Old hou&s;e, call'd the Kings hou&s;e, di&s;tant about Three miles from <HI>Machane&s;s,</HI> re&s;olving to conceal our &s;elves about that hou&s;e until night, and promi&s;ing to our &s;elves the greater &s;ecurity, becau&s;e we knew &s;ome Chri&s;tians u&s;ed commonly to work there, but proceeding in our journey, we di&s;cover'd upon a loaded Hor&s;e the Moor who lived at that hou&s;e, which oblig'd us to quicken our pace, and keep a head of him, for, if he &s;hould come up with us, he would ea&s;ily di&s;cover that we <PB N="15" REF="11"> did not belong to the &s;aid hou&s;e, We made ha&s;t therefore before him, and coming near the hou&s;e we di&s;cover'd about Twenty Moors &s;itting there; which accident of being hem|ed in behind and before by the&s;e our enemies, put us into a great fright, and had in all likely hood &s;poil'd our de&s;ign, in the very entrance, if providence had not pre&s;ented to our view, on one &s;ide of the hou&s;e, a parcel of Lime-kills, to which, without the Moors ob&s;ervation we immediatly &s;truck up, where we ab&s;conded our &s;elves by lying flat upon our bellies; about half an hour after came two Moori&s;h women thither, to gather up &s;ome loo&s;e wood, we con&s;idering it very inconvenient to &s;hew our &s;elves fearful, le&s;t we &s;hould be taken for Renagadoes, &s;poke to them, but they return'd us no an&s;wer, following their bu&s;ine&s;s, and taking us, as vve judged, either for Moors or Chri&s;tians employ'd about the &s;aid Lime-kills &s;o vve continued there vvithout any further mole&s;tation, until night, vvhen vve proceeded on our jour|ney, traveling about Eighteen miles that night, vve pa&s;&s;ed by a great many Tents, vvhence the Dogs came out and barkt at us, and the Moors al&s;o favv us, but &s;aid nothing, mi&s;ta|king us for their Country-men.</P>
<P>That night vve cro&s;t the great River, vvhich runs dovvn to
<HI>Mamora,</HI> about Eighteen miles di&s;tance from <HI>Machane&s;s,</HI> and about a mile from the bank of the River, vve found a convenient bu&s;h, vvhere vve took up our lodging all the day follovving, vvithout any di&s;turbance: At night vve found our &s;elves oblig'd to return to the &s;aid River, to furni&s;h us vvith Water, the littlene&s;s of our ve&s;&s;el, vvhich contain'd not above a Gallon, being a great hindrance in our journey: We continued our progre&s;s Tvvelve miles that night, vvhich prov'd very tire&s;ome by rea&s;on of the vveeds and bu&s;hes, and the nights vvere not &s;o long as vve vvi&s;h'd; ju&s;t about Day-break, vve found a convenient bu&s;h near to a great Valley, vvhere vve repos'd our &s;elves; as &s;oon as the day

<HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>At night we &s;et forwards, keeping the Woods, where were no Moori&s;h Inhabitants, only wild bea&s;ts, the le&s;s &s;a|vage and formidable, which we often &s;aw, but they never attempted to come near us, we travel'd about Ten miles that night, and then cro&s;&s;ed a River, which &s;upplied us with Water, whereof we were in want; on the other &s;ide of the River, we ob&s;erv'd the foot&s;teps of a great many Cattle, which rendred the place, as we thought, un&s;afe for us, we made therefore a little further progre&s;s in the morning, to the top of the Hill, where under a large Oak we found a bu&s;h convenient for our reception that day, but within a little while we were di&s;turb in our repo&s;e, ob&s;erving the Cattle to come gra&s;ing up the Hill, directly to that bu&s;h, with Moors at their heels, with all ha&s;t therefore we pact up our luggage and ran a mile further, without being di&s;cover'd, until we came to a Pear tree, furni&s;h'd with long-gra&s;s a round him, there we took up our quarters all that day, being the Fir&s;t of
<HI>June.</HI></P>
<P>The night following, we intended to proceed, but it plea|&s;ed God, to &s;trike me lame with the Gout, &s;o that I was not able to &s;tand, I was forced therefore to remain there all that night, and the day en&s;uing, which was a great hindrance to my companions, and affliction to my &s;elf: The readie&s;t expedient to remedy my di&s;temper, which I could think upon was this, we made a fire in a hole in the ground, and I put my Foot into the hole to draw away the pain, having al&s;o a Lancet with us, I endeavour'd to breath a Vein in my Foot, but I could not effect it, for the Lancet would not enter, however, I found &s;ome ea&s;e by the force of the fire: My company being &s;en&s;ible of the delay, which my di&s;temper <PB N="17" REF="12"> occa&s;ion'd, began to be mov'd, in&s;omuch that they told me, that if I could not march with them that night, they mu&s;t hold them&s;elves oblig'd to take leave of me, which added a great affliction to my &s;orrow, in&s;omuch as I was the Au|thor and fir&s;t mover of this e&s;cape; That I might not there|fore be for&s;aken by my companions, and in compliance to their importunity, I re&s;olved to &s;train my outmo&s;t power.</P>
<P>The third of <HI>June</HI> at night I endeavoured to go, but in great pain, &s;o that we could not proceed above Three miles, when I was forc'd to pray my Companions to &s;tay but that night, and I did not que&s;tion, but by Gods ble&s;&s;ing, to be able to travel with them the next, they con&s;ented, and &s;o we took up our lodging for the remainder of that night, under another Pear-tree.</P>
<P>The fourth of <HI>June</HI> I kept baking my foot all the day in the Ground, till about two in the Afternoon, in the mean while, I procur'd Mr.
<HI>Baxter</HI> to make me a wooden Leg, which accordingly he did, I per&s;waded them, then, to tra|vel about Three or Four miles that afternoon, which would a little ea&s;e the labour of the night, they agreed, I travel'd about Four miles with that Leg, and then re&s;ted till night on the top of a high Hill, whence we &s;aw a great plain valley before us.</P>
<P>At night we &s;hap'd our cour&s;e clear of the Tents, and tra|vel'd over the edge of the plain, about Six miles; We pa&s;t by &s;everal fields of corn, the Moors in the mean time hallow|ing to frighten the wild bea&s;ts from them: Cro&s;&s;ing of a Ri|ver that night, we &s;aw and heard &s;everal Lyons, &s;ome ap|proach'd &s;o near that we could almo&s;t have touch'd them, but as &s;oon as we &s;trook fire, which we had prepar'd for that very purpo&s;e, they pre&s;ently vani&s;h'd; when the light began to di&s;play it &s;elf, we took our quarters for the next day, which was <HI>June</HI> the Fifth; At night we continued our cour&s;e, when I was &s;till lame, which was a great hindrance to my <PB N="18" REF="13"> company, but we were loath to part, our bread al&s;o was al|mo&s;t at an end, the con&s;ideration whereof oblig'd me to &s;train hard to get Eight miles that night: By re&s;ting the next day I found my &s;elf to be &s;omething better, but then to qualifie my joy for this, Another companion <HI>Anthony Bayle</HI> began to &s;ink and give over.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the Sixth, We &s;et onward, and mea&s;ur'd Ten miles that night, when we came to a great Swamp, there my pain renewing, I fain would have per&s;waded them to &s;tay but by no intreaties could per&s;wade them, &s;o re&s;olving to part, we &s;har'd our Bread, which came to two half Rusks a peice; I endeavour'd to allure my weak wearied Brother to abide with me, comforting him with the expectation of Gar|dens, where we two more ea&s;ily than the company of Four, might provide for our &s;elves; He would not &s;tay; Being pre&s;t thus with the con&s;ideration of being le&s;t alone, I Re|&s;olv'd to put forward, when it plea&s;ed God, that my foot became perfectly whole and clear of the Gout; That night we travel'd over a high barren Hill, where we fancied we heard the Su&s;s and noi&s;e of the Sea, which encourag'd us to mend our pace until we met with a Garden, where we ga|ther'd about a dozen of &s;mall Pumpkins, a very comforta|ble a&s;&s;i&s;tance to us, now that our Bread was all &s;pent, for &s;ome we eat raw, and &s;ome we roa&s;ted in the ground, where|by we found our &s;elves con&s;iderably refre&s;ht: That night we made no more then Eight miles, for meeting with a great Oak which was blown down, we thought it inconvenient to over&s;lip &s;uch an advantageous retirement for the next day, which we were the more de&s;irous off, becau&s;e we heard a great many <HI>Moors,</HI> tho' we could not &s;ee them.</P>
<P>All the next day we lay &s;till and with exceeding content|ment we heard the noi&s;e of the Sea, at night we put on and came to the &s;hoar, where we found whereabout we then were, <HI>viz.</HI> to the <HI>Southward</HI> of
<HI>Mamora,</HI> we directed our <PB N="19" REF="13"> Cour&s;e then
<HI>Northward</HI> for Two miles, when we could di|&s;cern the Ca&s;tle, but knowing that we could not go to the <HI>Northward</HI> of the Ca&s;tle, becau&s;e the great River goes di|rectly up into the Country, we turn'd back about a mile, and finding a convenient bu&s;h, we re&s;ted there all the next day, hearing and &s;eeing a great many Cattle, but none came near us.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the Eighth, We gathered about half a Peck of Snailes, and caught a Land-Tortois, which we roa&s;ted and eat har|tily, that day al&s;o, we &s;aw a Ship in the Offing, when night was come, we made down towards the Ca&s;tle, and before we were aware we fell upon a Moor making a fire, which forc'd us to draw back, the Moor not di&s;cerning us, we fetcht then a compa&s;s, and by another way came down to the Ca&s;tle, there we found a &s;trong watch, which did wholly di&s;courage our expectations of relief from that place, &s;o we &s;et up our Re&s;olutions for <HI>Sall&eacute;,</HI> about Eighteen or Twenty miles to the <HI>Southward,</HI> to &s;ee what good could be done there, But before we parted with <HI>Mamora,</HI> we made bold with a little Barley and Guinny corn, growing under the Ca&s;tle, of each whereof we gathered about a quarter of a Peck, to &s;erve our nece&s;&s;ities, and then we betook our &s;elves to our former nights refuge, the Bu&s;h, and after having con&s;ulted how to &s;teer our cour&s;e for <HI>Sall&eacute;,</HI> the re&s;ult whereof was a long the Sea-&s;ide, we re&s;ted all the next day without di&s;tur|bance.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the Ninth, We travel'd along the Sea-&s;ide, where we &s;aw a great deal of Ra&s;t-timber, we concluded therefore, &s;eeing the Ship in the Offing, to make a Raft, which accor|dingly we did, and put off with it, but it would not &s;wim, boyart with us all, we came therefore a &s;hore, and cut all our La&s;hings, leaving it to the mercy of the Sea: We tra|vel'd Five miles towards <HI>Sall&eacute;</HI> that night, fearing lea&s;t by &s;taying long thereabout we &s;hould be di&s;covered, for our foot|ing
<PB N="20" REF="14"> and trayling of the Timber had made &s;uch an Impre&s;&s;ion in the &s;and as if an Hundred men had been there; That night we took up our quarters in a Fig-tree, about Seven miles &s;hort of
<HI>Sall&eacute;</HI> where was no Inhabitant.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> the Tenth at night, we made forward to
<HI>Sall&eacute;,</HI> in the Road, we &s;ell upon a parcel of Tents, where though the Dogs were ready to &s;eize us, and the Moors them&s;elves call'd to us, We made no an&s;wer and travel'd on, without any far|ther trouble or danger, until we came to <HI>Sall&eacute;,</HI> as &s;oon as we came thither, we made towards the Gardens, and gathered &s;ome Pumkins, and becau&s;e night was far &s;pent, we retrea|ted about a mile out of Town, to find &s;ome place which might &s;ecure us from di&s;covery; we pitch'd upon a Bu&s;h in a great Valley, wherein we re&s;olv'd to enclo&s;e our &s;elves the day following: About Eleven of the clock of that day, we e&s;pied a Boy with a Dog keeping of Sheep, but yet not forgeting his game, which was hunting of Partridges; He beat the bu&s;h wherein we were lodg'd, and threvv in Stones, and the Dog al&s;o did his part, barking and cour&s;ing about the bu&s;h, buthy miracle as we thought, we were not e&s;pied, tho' we di&s;cover'd abundance of fear among&s;t our &s;elves, for if we had been taken notice of, we could not otherwi&s;e con|&s;ult our own &s;afety, than by the death of that poor &s;illy Lad.</P>
<P>The eleventh day being pa&s;t, at night we made a de&s;cent to the River of <HI>Sall&eacute;,</HI> about a mile above the Town, where we found a Boat, but could not with all our &s;trength launch her: <HI>Anthony Bayle</HI> and I who were the only &s;wimmers in our company, made over to the
<HI>South-&s;ide</HI> of the River, to &s;ee what purcha&s;e we could make there, we found indeed Three boats, but they were all aground, &s;o that we could do no good with them; But in &s;earching about the new Ships, (which Five in number are building there) we found two Oares, with which we &s;wam over to our con&s;orts, and <PB N="21" REF="14"> all together we went down by the Rivers &s;ide, to the Har|bours mouth, but we could meet with no boat to put our Oares in; We &s;aw two <HI>Dutch-</HI>men in the River, but they kept a diligent watch, which hindred us from carrying away their boat; We concluded therefore to bury our Oares in the &s;and at &s;ome remarkable place, and &s;o we betook our &s;elves to find out a &s;anctuary for the day following; We found a Fig-tree full of leaves, in an unfrequented place, as we thought, on the <HI>North-&s;ide</HI> of the River, yet within call of the Ships, vvhich then vvere a building? Under the Covert of this little Tree, tho' &s;urrounded vvith Enemies and dan|gers, vve re&s;olv'd to expect the protection of the next day; The Reader may po&s;&s;ibly judge this an in&s;tance of a Roman|tick courage, and an effect rather of ra&s;h boldne&s;s than pru|dent con&s;ideration; Truly, he is in the right, for vve our &s;elves vvere of the &s;ame mind, about the middle of the next day, upon this occa&s;ion, a Moor vvho had nevvly vva&s;ht his cloaths, directs his cour&s;e directly to our Tree, and there hangs up his <HI>Al hage</HI> to dry vvhil&s;t he him&s;elf &s;at dovvn not far off, to lovv&s;e him&s;elf, an't plea&s;e you; if providence did hinder him from di&s;cerning us, I a&s;&s;ure you it vvas not for vvant of provocation, as vve all confe&s;t, and indeed I never in my life vvas in &s;uch a trembling fit, as that lovv&s;ie Ra&s;cal put me into.</P>
<P>The Tvvelfth day of <HI>June</HI> being pa&s;t, at night vve came dovvn again to the River, to look after a boat, vvhich vve had ob&s;erv'd vvas moor'd in the River, half a mile higher than vvhere vve found the Oares, this, vve vvho could &s;vvim found and brought to our con&s;orts, We padl'd her dovvn the River clo&s;e by the <HI>Dutch</HI> men, vvho &s;avv us, but &s;aid nothing, then vve put a &s;hore, and fetcht our Oares, vve continued padling, until vve had pa&s;t a <HI>French-</HI>man, lying at the Bars mouth, vvho plainly &s;avv us, but &s;aid nothing; So &s;oon as vve had left him behind us, vve &s;hipp'd out our Oares, and <PB N="22" REF="15"> Rovving right into the Sea, our cour&s;e by the <HI>North-&s;tar</HI> vvas
<HI>We&s;t-North-We&s;t:</HI> vvhen vve had Rovved Four Miles or thereabout, vve di&s;cern'd a Ship at Anchor, vvhich ob|lig'd us to alter our cour&s;e, and Rovv <HI>Northward,</HI> until vve had pa&s;t her, fearing lea&s;t &s;he might be a <HI>Sall&egrave;-</HI>Ship, and vve had learn'd at <HI>Machane&s;s</HI> that Tvvo of them vvere a cruizing at that time, and not yet come in, therefore it vvas, that in di&s;tru&s;t of this Ship, vve altered our cour&s;e; vve Rovved about Tvvo Leagues vvithout the Ship, and lay upon our Oares; vvhen Day broke up clear, vve &s;avv the Ship vvith her Sailes loo&s;e, I then acquainted my Con&s;orts, that in my judgment, if the Ship vvere of <HI>Sall&eacute;</HI> &s;he vvould make in for the <HI>Bar</HI> at that time, becau&s;e the Tide and the Sea breeze vvere then both favourable, it being High-vvater at Seven of the Clock, but if &s;he vvere an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man of War, as vve ince&s;&s;antly vvi&s;h'd, then vve thought the Sea-breeze vvould make her &s;tand off to Sea: Notwith&s;tanding our opinions were various, and we were doubtful what to do; at length I per&s;waded my con&s;orts, with much ado, to row in and make her hull, then the Ship &s;tood off, and at length &s;aw us, we pull'd aboard, and found her to be the <HI>Lark-Friggot</HI> Captain
<HI>Leighton</HI> Commander; after &s;ome Examination and Di&s;cour&s;e about the Methods and Means of our E&s;cape, I propounded to the Captain a de|&s;ign which had newly taken &s;trong po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my Fancy, it was this, that if he would accommodate me with his Boat, and tho&s;e belonging to the other Two Men of War, which were in Company, I would undertake to Pilot them in, and to burn what Ships were then at <HI>Mamora;</HI> The Captain im|mediately &s;tood to the <HI>Northward,</HI> and came up with the other Two Ships, which were the <HI>Bonaventure</HI> and the <HI>Gray|hound;</HI> The Admiral was then Sick at <HI>Cales,</HI> &s;o Captain <HI>Macdonald</HI> being Elde&s;t Captain, we went aboard him, and &s;ending for Mr. <HI>Fairborne,</HI> who was then Captain under <PB N="23" REF="15"> Captain <HI>Prie&s;tman,</HI> who was Sick as above&s;aid, they held a Council about tho&s;e propo&s;itions which I had made, at fir&s;t they &s;eemed unpracticable, by rea&s;on of many difficulties, but e&s;pecially of the <HI>Bar,</HI> which is wor&s;e than that of <HI>Sall&eacute;;</HI> But then when upon Second thoughts they con&s;idered the forwardne&s;s of Men, who but that very Day had e&s;capt a heavy Slavery, and yet were willing that very Night to en|gage in the action, they concluded it both po&s;&s;ible and fea|&s;ible, &s;o they entertain'd with approbation what I had pro|pos'd; After which I immediately return'd with Captain
<HI>Leighton</HI> aboard the <HI>Lark,</HI> and communicated the re&s;ult of the Council with my Comrade Mr. <HI>Baxter,</HI> who was heartily pleas'd with what was undertaken, and willing to go along, &s;o he was ordered to go in the
<HI>Bonaventure's</HI> Boat, and was very &s;erviceable, and who was better acquianted with that Bar, than I was. Immediately orders were given to &s;have &s;ome Deal-boards, and &s;aw &s;ome Tarr-barrels, and make rea|dy with all expedition; by Seven at Night, all things were in readine&s;s, the Friggots were riding Two Leagues from Shore, orders were given that the Boat in which I was, viz. the <HI>Gray-hound's,</HI> &s;hould go a head, Commanded by Captain
<HI>Macdonald,</HI> who behaved him&s;elf indeed with great Courage and Re&s;olution, and the re&s;t had orders to follow us; there were Three Barges in all, and one Yawl, the number of Men concern'd in the action, was Forty two, who all had &s;trict charge upon pain of Death, not to &s;eek after Plunder, which was punctually ob&s;erv'd. About Eight at Night we put off from the Ships, and betwixt Nine and Ten, we fell a little to the <HI>Northward</HI> of the <HI>Bar,</HI> but by Mr. <HI>Baxter's</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance, we quickly righted our &s;elves, and found the <HI>Bar;</HI> there was a great noi&s;e upon the Shore, all thereabout had taken the Alarm, which did nothing di&s;courage us, we proceeded lu&s;tily, without any concernment at their hideous outcries, which when the Moors perceiv'd, and that we advanc'd with
<PB N="24" REF="16"> undaunted Re&s;olutions, they thought it be&s;t to flie betimes and &s;ecure them&s;elves and their Ca&s;tle; in the mean time we pur&s;u'd our de&s;ign towards the Ships, aboard which, there being a great many Lights, we ob&s;erv'd the Moors looking over the &s;ides of the fir&s;t we came to, which was the bigger of the Two, they call'd to us, to keep off, we an&s;wered them with about Twenty Granado-&s;hells, which &s;oon drove them overboard; they had not far indeed to e&s;cape, for the Ca&s;tle Wall was within a Boats length of the Ship, &s;o with|out any difficulty we pre&s;ently entred; one Moor we found aboard, who was pre&s;ently cut in pieces, another was &s;hot in the head, endeavouring to e&s;cape upon the Cable, we were not long in taking in our Shavings and Tarr-barrels, and &s;o &s;et her on fire in &s;everal places, &s;he being very apt to re|ceive what we de&s;ign'd, for there were &s;everal Barrels of Tar upon the Deck, and &s;he was newly Tarr'd as if on pur|po&s;e; whil&s;t we were &s;etting her on fire, we heard a noi&s;e of &s;ome people in the Hold, we opened the Skuttles, and thereby &s;av'd the lives of Four Chri&s;tians, Three <HI>Dutch-men</HI> and One <HI>French,</HI> who told us that the Ship on fire was Admiral and belong'd to
<HI>Aly-Hackum,</HI> and the other which we &s;oon after &s;erv'd with the &s;ame &s;auce, had the Name of <HI>Plummage Cortibe,</HI> which was the very Ship, which in <HI>October</HI> la&s;t took me Captive, I cannot deny that I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an extraordinary &s;atisfaction to &s;ee this Ship on fire, and I could not but admire the wonderful providence of God, to whom alone Vengeance belongeth, in vindicating my cau&s;e, and making me an unwitting in&s;trument of revenge, for the injuries I received from the owners of this Ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>Such was the fiercene&s;s of the Flames, that vve vvere forc'd to keep off from the Ships &s;ides, vvhereby vve be|came obnoxious to the &s;hot of the Moors, vvho from the Walls of the Ca&s;tle made a great firing upon us, both of &s;mall and great Guns, but vvith little or no Execution, for
<PB N="25" REF="16"> our Men, by the light of the great fire having them in per|fect view upon the Walls, made &s;mart returns upon them, firing ince&s;&s;antly upon them, and with that eagerne&s;s, that they quite neglected their Oares, &s;o that if the Tide had not turn'd to Ebb, we &s;hould have run a great ri&s;que, our Men were &s;o full of joy, hooping and hallowing at the &s;ight of &s;o de&s;irable a Bon-fire, that they never minded the dangers they might be &s;ubject to; we were therefore forced to row the
<HI>Bonaventure's</HI> Yawl, who had lo&s;t all her Oares. In all this Action we had but one Man mortally wounded, and two or three more &s;lightly hurt: after we had compleated our bu&s;ine&s;s, and ab&s;olutely de&s;troyed the&s;e Ships, we return'd out of the River, over the <HI>Bar,</HI> and pull'd aboard the Friggots, Captain <HI>Macdonald</HI> received us kindly, and gratified us with the entertainment of his Ship very frankly, aboard which we &s;taid until we came to <HI>Cales,</HI> there we went a&s;hore, de&s;igning a pa&s;&s;age for <HI>Eng|land</HI> with the fir&s;t opportunity; Captain <HI>Macdonald</HI> gave us Certificates of our &s;ervice in the late Action, and then Mr.
<HI>Baxter</HI> and I took leave of him; we did not &s;tay long at
<HI>Cales,</HI> before we met with an opportunity for <HI>England</HI> aboard Captain <HI>Atkins,</HI> who came from <HI>Leghorn</HI> and was bound for
<HI>London,</HI> who very willingly granted us pa&s;&s;age with him, and gave us civil and welcome entertainment, whom God reward and all other our Benefactors, parti|cularly (tho' to &s;ome Readers it may &s;eems immaterial, yet when occa&s;ion offers, not to remember, to all good Men will appear unthankful, and I had rather be tax'd with im|pertmence than ungratitude) Mr.
<HI>Hodges,</HI> who be&s;tow|ed upon us Four pieces of Eight in our nece&s;&s;ity, God return his Charity into his own Bo&s;ome with ble&s;&s;ing and encrea&s;e, and hone&s;t Captain <HI>Gutteridge,</HI> who &s;ent a Barrel of Beaf and a Hundred weight of Bread, lea&s;t we &s;hould lie too chargeable upon Captain <HI>Atkins</HI> in our <PB N="26" REF="17"> pa&s;&s;age home, who the Fir&s;t day of <HI>July</HI> 1685. &s;et Sail from <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and arrived in the <HI>Downs</HI> the <HI>26th.</HI> of that Month.</P>
<P>Thus have I given a &s;hort and plain account of my Captivity and E&s;cape, with the circum|&s;tances that attended it, and tho' po&s;&s;ibly my Stile may appear rough and unpoli&s;h'd, which the courteous Reader I hope will a little ex|cu&s;e, expecting no other from a blunt Seaman, acquainted with nothing &s;o much as Dangers and Storms, yet I do profe&s;s I have Penn'd this Narrative with all the &s;incerity and truth, that becomes a plain-dealing
<HI>Engli&s;h-man:</HI> My de|&s;ign and aim in all (kind Country-man and courteous Reader) is, to excite with me thy prai&s;es to our God the only deliverer, who hath de|livered me from a cruel and &s;evere Captivity, and withal to &s;tir up thy grateful re&s;entments, for the happine&s;s, peace and freedom, that thou enjoye&s;t under &s;o excellent and well tempered a Government, but mo&s;t e&s;pecially to move thy pitty for the afflictions of
<HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> to excite thy compa&s;&s;ionate regard to tho&s;e poor Country-men now Langui&s;hing in mi|&s;ery and Irons, to endeavour their relea&s;ment according to thy power, at lea&s;t by impor|tuning
<PB N="27" REF="17"> Heaven, that during their Captivity God would &s;upport them with his Grace, to bear patiently their afflictions, and to re&s;i&s;t all Temptations until in his good appointed time, he vouch&s;afe them a happy deliverance, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
