</FIGURE>&leaf; By the King. &leaf; A Proclamation for &s;etling the Plantation of Virginia.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_WHereas the Colonie of <HI>&V;irginia,</HI> Planted by the hands of Our</HI> mo&s;t deare Father of ble&s;&s;ed memory, for the propagation of Chri&s;tian Religion, the increa&s;e of Trade, and the enlarging of his Royall Em|pire, hath not hitherto pro&s;pered &s;o happily, as was hoped and de&s;ired, A great occa&s;ion whereof his late Maie&s;ty conceiued to be, for that the gouernment of that Colony was committed to the Company of <HI>Vir|ginia,</HI> encorporated of a multitude of per&s;ons of &s;euerall di&s;po&s;itions, among&s;t whom the affaires of greate&s;t moment were, and mu&s;t be ru|led by the greater number of Votes and Voyces; And therefore his late Maie&s;tie, out of His great Wi&s;edome, and depth of Iudgement, did de&s;ire to re&s;ume that popular gouernment, and accordingly the Letters Patents of that Incorporation, were by his Highne&s;&s;e direction in a Legall cour&s;e que&s;tioned, and thereupon iudicially repealed, and adiudged to bee voyde; wherein his Maie|&s;ties ayme was onely, to reduce that gouernment into &s;uch a right cour&s;e, as might be&s;t agree with that forme which was held in the re&s;t of his Royall Monarchy, and was not intended by him, to take away, or impeach the particular Intere&s;t of any priuate Plantor, or Aduenturer, nor to alter the &s;ame, otherwi&s;e then &s;hould be of nece&s;&s;ity for the good of the publique: And wheras We continue the like care of tho&s;e Colonies and Plantatious, as Our late deare Father did, and vpon deliberate aduice and con&s;ideration, are of the &s;ame Iudgement that Our &s;aid Father was of, for the gouernment of that Colony of <HI>Virginia;</HI> Now le&s;t the apprehen&s;ion of former per&s;onall differences, which haue heretofore happened (the reuiuing and continuing whereof Wee vtterly di&s;allow, and &s;trictly forbid) might di&s;tract the mindes of the Plantors and Aduenturers, or the opinion, that We would neglect tho&s;e Plantations, might di&s;courage men to goe or &s;end thither, &amp; &s;o hinder the perfecting of that worke, wherin We hold the honor of Our deare Father decea&s;ed, and Our owne honour to be deeply engaged; We haue thought fit to declare, and by Our Royal Proclamation to publi&s;h Our owne Iudgement, and re&s;olution in the&s;e things, which by Gods a&s;&s;i&s;tance Wee purpo&s;e con&s;tantly to pur&s;ue. And therefore Wee doe by the&s;e pre&s;ents publi&s;h and declare to all Our louing Subiects, and to the whole world, that Wee hold tho&s;e Territories of <HI>Virginia</HI> and the <HI>Sommer-Ilands,</HI> as al&s;o that of <HI>New England,</HI> where Our Colonies are already plan|ted, &amp; within the limits &amp; bounds wherof, Our late deare Father, by His Letters Patents, vnder His great Seale of <HI>England,</HI> remaining of Record, hath giuen leaue and liberty to His Subiects to plant and inhabite, to be a part of Our Royall Empire, de&s;cended vpon Vs and vndoubtedly be|longing and appertaining vnto Vs; And that We hold Our &s;elfe, a&s;well bound by Our Regal of|fice, to protect, maintaine, and &s;upport the &s;ame, and are &s;o re&s;olued to doe, as any other part of Our Dominions:</P>
<P>And that Our full re&s;olution is, to the end that there may be one vniforme cour&s;e of Gouern|ment, in, and through all Our whole Monarchie, That the Gouernment of the Colonie of <HI>Vir|ginia</HI>
<PB REF="2"> &s;hall immediatly depend vpon Our Selfe, and not be committed to any Company or Cor|poration, to whom it may be proper to tru&s;t matters of Trade and Commerce, but cannot bee fit or &s;afe to communicate the ordering of State-affaires, be they of neuer &s;o meane con&s;equence: And that therefore Wee haue determined, That Our Commi&s;&s;ioners for tho&s;e Affaires, &s;hall proceed according to the tenor of Our Commi&s;&s;ion directed vnto them, vntill Wee &s;hall declare Our further plea&s;ure therein. Neuerthele&s;&s;e We doe herby declare, That Wee are re&s;olued, with as much conuenient expedition, as Our Affaires of greater importance will giue leaue, to e&s;tabli&s;h a Councell, con&s;i&s;ting of a few per&s;ons of vnder&s;tanding and qualitie, to whom We will giue tru&s;t for the immediate care of the Affaires of that Colony, and who &s;hall be an&s;werable to Vs for their proceedings, and in matters of greater moment, &s;hall be &s;ubordinate and atten|dant vnto Our Priuie Councell heere; And that We will al&s;o e&s;tabli&s;h another Councell to be re&s;ident in <HI>Virginia,</HI> who &s;hall be &s;ubordinate to Our Councell here for that Colonie; and that at Our owne charge We will maintaine tho&s;e publique Officers and Mini&s;ters, and that &s;trength of Men, Munition, and Fortification, as &s;hall be fit and nece&s;&s;ary for the defence of that Plan|tation, and will by any cour&s;e that &s;hall be de&s;ired of Vs, &s;ettle and a&s;&s;ure the particular rights and intere&s;ts of euery Planter and Aduenturer, in any of tho&s;e Territories, which &s;hall de&s;ire the &s;ame, to giue them full &s;ati&s;faction for their quiet and a&s;&s;ured enioying thereof.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, whereas it is agreed on all &s;ides, that the Tobacco of tho&s;e plantations of <HI>Virginia</HI> and the <HI>Sommer I&s;lands</HI> (which is the onely pre&s;ent meanes for their &s;ub&s;i&s;ting) cannot be managed for the good of the Plantations, vnle&s;&s;e it be brought into one hand, whereby the forreigne To|bacco may be carefully kept out, and the Tobacco of tho&s;e Plantations may yeeld a certaine and ready price to the owners thereof; Wee doe hereby declare, That to auoid all differences and contrariety of opinions, which will hardly be reconciled among&s;t the Planters and Aduenturers them&s;elues, We are re&s;olued to take the &s;ame into Our owne hands, and by Our &s;eruants or Agents for Vs, to giue &s;uch prices to the Planters and Aduenturers for the &s;ame, as may giue them rea&s;onable &s;ati&s;faction and encouragement; but of the maner thereof, Wee will determine hereafter at better lei&s;ure: And when We &s;hall haue concluded the &s;ame, We &s;hall expect, that all Our louing Subiects will readily conforme them&s;elues thereunto.</P>
<P>And in the meane time, becau&s;e the importation and v&s;e of forreigne Tobacco, which is not of the growth of tho&s;e Plantations, or one of them, will vi&s;ibly &amp; a&s;&s;uredly vndermine and de&s;troy tho&s;e Plantations, by taking away the meanes of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, We doe hereby &s;trictly charge and command, That Our late Proclamation, bearing date the ninth day of April la&s;t, intituled, <HI>(A Proclamation touching Tobacco)</HI> &s;hall in all points and parts thereof, be duely and &s;trictly ob&s;er|ued, vpon paine of Our high di&s;plea&s;ure, and &s;uch further penalties and puni&s;hments, as by the &s;ayd Proclamation are to be inflicted vpon the offenders. And We doe hereby adui&s;e all Our lo|uing Subiects, and all others whom it may concerne, not to aduenture the breach of our Royall Commandement in any of the premi&s;&s;es, We being fully re&s;olued, vpon no importunitie or inter|ce&s;&s;ion what&s;oeuer, to relea&s;e or remit the de&s;erued puni&s;hment of &s;uch, as &s;hall dare to offend a|gain&s;t the &s;ame, &s;eeing We holde not Our Selfe onely, but Our people intere&s;ted therein.</P>
