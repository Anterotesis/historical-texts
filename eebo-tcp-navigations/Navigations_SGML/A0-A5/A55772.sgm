<P>_THe three Sonnes of <HI>Brutus, Locri|nus, Albanactus,</HI> and <HI>Camber</HI> divided the whole Isle of <HI>Bri|taine</HI> into three Parts. The part contained within the <HI>French</HI> Seas, the Rivers <HI>Severne</HI> (called in Bri|tish <HI>Hafren</HI>) <HI>Dee</HI> and <HI>Humber</HI> fell to <HI>Locrinus</HI> the eldest son, from whom it was called <HI>Lloyger,</HI> which name it hath in the <HI>British</HI> tongue to this day, in <HI>English</HI> it is called <HI>England,</HI> and now extendeth it selfe Northward to the River <HI>Tweed;</HI> The 2d son <HI>Albana|nactus</HI> had all the Country Northward from <HI>Humber</HI> to the Sea <HI>Orkney</HI> (called in the <HI>British</HI> tongue <HI>M&ocirc;r Werydh,</HI> and in Latine <HI>Mare Caledonium</HI>) for his Share; The 3d son <HI>Camber</HI> had the remaining part lying within the <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Irish</HI> Seas, and separated from <HI>England</HI> by the Rivers <HI>Severne</HI> and <HI>Dee;</HI> this part was after his name called <HI>Cambria,</HI> the Inhabitants <HI>Cambry,</HI> and their Language <HI>Camberaec,</HI> as at this day; The Inhabitants of this part have kept their Country and Language about 2690 years, without commixtion with any other Na|tion. This Country <HI>Cambria,</HI> in British <HI>Cymru,</HI> was called by the <HI>Saxons</HI> (a people of <HI>Germany</HI> that conquered and inhabi|ted that part of Britaine called <HI>Lloyger</HI>) <HI>Wales,</HI> and the Inha|bitants and the Language, <HI>Welsh,</HI> which are words signifying <HI>strange;</HI> and the Inhabitants of High and Low <HI>Germany</HI> doe at this day call the Language they do not understand, <HI>Walsh,</HI> and the people that speake it, <HI>Welshmen;</HI> so that they are much de|ceived,

That the Country was call|ed <HI>Wales</HI> and the People <HI>Welsh</HI> by the <HI>Saxons</HI> (a strange Nati|on) is evident, in that the <HI>Welsh</HI> know not what those words meane, their mother tongue teaching them only to call themselves <HI>Cymru</HI> and their Language <HI>Cymraec;</HI> And that they were not <HI>Romans</HI> that were driven into <HI>Cambria,</HI> the language doth sufficiently evince, which hath words that have no affinity at all with the <HI>Latine:</HI> it must needs be granted that many words are borrowed from the <HI>Latine,</HI> as it could not be o|therwise, the <HI>Roman Legions</HI> and <HI>Colonies</HI> having been so long seated in the Country, but they are so different in termination that it requires some skill to discover the words that are of <HI>Ro|man</HI> extraction.</P>

<P>BE Pleased, Gentle Reader, to take this short account of the <HI>British Annals</HI> following, as also of this and the former Edition thereof. <HI>Caradoc</HI> of <HI>Lancarvan</HI> collected the <HI>Acts</HI> and <HI>Successions</HI> of the <HI>British Princes</HI> from <HI>Cad|walader</HI> to the yeare of Christ 1156. Of his <HI>Collections</HI> there were afterward severall <HI>Copies</HI> kept in the <HI>Abbeys</HI> of <HI>Conwey</HI> in <HI>Car|narvonshire,</HI> and of <HI>Strata Florida</HI> or <HI>Stra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">flur</HI> in <HI>Cardigan|shire,</HI> which received addition as things fell out, being ordinarily compared together every third yeare, to wit, when the <HI>Bards</HI> or <HI>Beirdh</HI> belonging to those <HI>Abbeys</HI> went their ordinary Visitation (which they called <HI>Clera</HI>) from the one to the other; They contai|ned in them (besides) such other occurrences happening within the Isle of <HI>Britaine,</HI> as were thought worthy the <HI>Recording.</HI> This Course continued in those <HI>Abbeys</HI> untill the yeare of Christ 1270, which was a little before the death of the last Prince <HI>Llewelyn,</HI> who was slaine at <HI>Buellt.</HI> Of these <HI>Collections</HI> there were a 100 Copies at least in <HI>Wales</HI> very anciently written. <HI>Humphrey Lloyd</HI> Gentleman (a painfull and worthy searcher of <HI>British</HI> Antiquities) lighting upon one of the Copies, translated it into <HI>English,</HI> and augmented it somewhat, out of <HI>Matt. Paris</HI> and <HI>Nicolas Trivet</HI> chiefely, but left it imperfect, God being pleased to take him away before he had finished it, as he had designed. The Right Honoura|ble <HI>Sir Henry Sidney</HI> Lord President of <HI>Wales,</HI> having had a Copy of his <HI>Translation</HI> a great while lying by him, employed <HI>David Powel</HI> Doctor of Divinity to Peruse, Correct, Augment, and Con|tinue it in order to the setting of it out in Print. The <HI>Doctor</HI> at his request compared the translation with the <HI>British</HI> Booke, where|of he had two ancient Copies, and corrected it where he saw cause. Moreover he consulted all Authors he could come by, that treat of the affaires of <HI>Wales,</HI> as <HI>Gildas, Asser Menevens., Galfrid, Wil|liam</HI> of <HI>Newborough, Matt. Paris, Matt.

D. 1584, and Dedicated to the Famous <HI>Sir Philip Sidney</HI> Knight. Some of the Notes he <HI>added</HI> where he sound they were wanting, and some other, where the matter was delivered briefly and obscurely, for the better clearing of the Text he <HI>inserted</HI> in their due places in the <HI>Booke.</HI> Also he gave in the <HI>Margent</HI> exact <HI>quotations</HI> of the <HI>Authors,</HI> as well where they agree with the Book as when they are brought to Adde to it, or for further Explanation.

And the Book would have come out much more exactly done, had it not bin Printed almost quite off, when he received another Larger, and better cor|rected Copy of the <HI>Translation</HI> from <HI>Robert Glover</HI> Somerset Herald: So much touching the former <HI>Edition</HI> out of Dr <HI>Powell's</HI> Epist.

But one night, as he lay a bed, an An|gell appearing to him, and telling him, that it was Gods will he should goe to <HI>Rome,</HI> and there spend the rest of his dayes in the service of God, and that it was declared that neither he nor his posterity should have the chiefe rule of <HI>Britaine,</HI> untill the time that his bones were brought back from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Britaine,</HI> made him alter his resolution, and goe to <HI>Rome</HI> A.

Ieffrey</HI> of <HI>Monmouth</HI> who saith that <HI>Cadwalader</HI> dyed in Pope <HI>Sergius</HI> his time on the 12 of the calends of May, seems to mistake <HI>Cadwalader</HI> for <HI>Cadwalla</HI> King of the <HI>West-Saxons,</HI> who went to <HI>Rome</HI> 688, being the 3d year of the Reigne of <HI>Alfred</HI> King of <HI>Northumberland</HI> as <HI>Beda</HI> in the 7 and 8 Chap|ters of the 5 book of his <HI>Ecclesiasticall History,</HI> and also <HI>S.

<P>&fleurdelys; Of <HI>Cadwalader, Cedwall,</HI> and <HI>Ivor,</HI> there be diverse opini|nions.

<P>At the same time <HI>Ethoal</HI> King of the <HI>Brytains,</HI> when he had by the space of ten years warred with diverse Kings, and often put them to the worse, at length coming to an agreement with them, he reigned over the <HI>West Saxons</HI> two years: then perceiving <HI>Bry|taine</HI> to be overworne with miseries, and preferring the heavenly Kingdome before the earthly, he came to <HI>Rome,</HI> and within few days dyed: and in him ended wholly that ancient Kingdome of the <HI>Brytains,</HI> which continued in a manner longer then any other, from <HI>Heli</HI> the priest to this time, by the space of 1825&punc; yeares.</P>
<P>Further, it is not like that <HI>Iuor</HI> coming to the aid of <HI>Edwal</HI> his cousen would euer seeke the kingdome to himselfe and defeate the right heire: but very well it may be, if this <HI>Iuor</HI> be that man whom the <HI>Saxon</HI> writers call <HI>Inas</HI> or <HI>Iue,</HI> that after these <HI>Brytaines</HI> had arriued in the south part of this <HI>realme,</HI> and fought diuers times with the <HI>Saxon</HI> kings, and continued in <HI>Cornewall, Deuon|shire,</HI> and <HI>Somersetshire</HI> by the space of two yeares&punc; they should meet <HI>Centwyn</HI> in the field and so fall to an agreement, that <HI>Iuor</HI> taking <HI>Ethelburga</HI> the cousen of <HI>Centwyn</HI> to wife should enjoy the kingdome of the <HI>West Saxons</HI> after <HI>Centwyn,</HI> and that therevpon <HI>Edwal</HI> resigning his title and interest to <HI>Iuor</HI> departed to <HI>Rome,</HI> and so died: as <HI>Guidonius</HI> saith.</P>

<P>Deare friends and companions, let us weigh and consider not on|ly<NOTE PLACE="marg">The oration of <HI>Sibertus</HI> to the other <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings.</NOTE> what we are our selves, but also what our enemies are which come against us: they are the very <HI>Britains,</HI> whose Fathers and Ance|stors our Fathers have bereft of their inheritance, and expelled out of their <HI>own</HI> land, and now they justly come against us to claime that which our Ancestors by violence have taken from theirs. Let us therefore like other Nations choose unto us a Head; to lead, di|rect, and governe us, whom, as chief Lord in time of Peace and Warre, we as Members may obey and stick to, sith without a Head there is no victory to be looked for. Have not the <HI>Brytains</HI> after two years of their dispersion set upon the ancient <HI>Saxons</HI> (a more valiant people than we are) fifteen times within seaven years? Did they not spoile their Kingdomes, kill their people, and leave such as remained alive sore wounded and maimed at their departure?</P>
<P>The rest of the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings agreed to his mind, and with one assent chose that worthy Knight <HI>Ina</HI> King of <HI>Westsex</HI> to be their Soveraigne, who having taken their Homage, advanced his Stan|dard, and marching forward against <HI>Ivor</HI> and <HI>Henyr</HI> set upon them, so that they were faine to forsake their Tents, and flye into <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>Thus <HI>Inas</HI> having obtained the victory with the other <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings (saving <HI>Sibertus</HI> who by reason of his age and impotency had gone home before) returned to <HI>Southampton,</HI> where his Cousen <HI>Adelard</HI> informed him that <HI>Ivor</HI> and <HI>Henyr</HI> had gathered and le|vied a puissant Army afresh to set upon the <HI>Saxons:</HI> whereupon <HI>Inas</HI> foreslowed not the matter, but went against them, and layd siege to the Castle of <HI>Snowdon,</HI> compelling the <HI>Brytains</HI> to flye to their ships, and while he was at <HI>Bangor</HI> with the other <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings, and the Nobles of <HI>Wales</HI> he kept the feast of S. <HI>David,</HI> and then dismissed the other Kings home to their Country, untill hee should have occasion for them again: and departed himselfe with <HI>Adelard</HI> his cousen to Queen <HI>Ethelburga</HI> being then at <HI>Manchester</HI> and continued there almost three months.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="20">In the mean while <HI>Adelard</HI> minding to travell about all <HI>Wales</HI> met three spies, of whom (being by him taken and exami|ned) he learned that <HI>Ivor</HI> and <HI>Henyr</HI> were returning againe with a huge strong Army, such as all the <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings would not be able to resist. Then went he and shewed <HI>Inas</HI> what he had heard: wherefore <HI>Inas</HI> forthwith certified the other <HI>Saxon</HI> Kings of the same, commanding them without delay to be ready at <HI>Chester</HI> with Horse and Armour to go against their ene|mies, and to defend their Country from violence.

From thence came the <HI>Goths,</HI> who overran <HI>Germany, France, Spain, Afrike</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI> From thence came the <HI>Vandals</HI> of no less worthiness. From thence came the <HI>Lombards,</HI> the <HI>Alans,</HI> the <HI>Switzers,</HI> the <HI>Burgundians,</HI> the <HI>Danes,</HI> and the <HI>Normans,</HI> who came from <HI>Norway</HI> and the sea shore of <HI>Eastland</HI> by <HI>Prussia,</HI> from whence the <HI>Vandals</HI> came.

The Bishop and the Consul (suspecting no guile) were very glad not only to be delivered from the present distresse, but also to gain so great a person to the Christian Religi|on Whereupon a firm Peace being made between both Nations, <HI>Hasting</HI> is Baptized, the Bishop and the Consul being his God-fa|thers; this being performed, he was carried by his Souldiers to his ships, in very weak case, as was outwardly pretended. About midnight he caused himselfe, being compleatly armed, to be laid upon a <HI>Beere,</HI> commanding also his souldiers to arme themselves, and to carry their weapons under their upper garments, so that they might be ready when he should give them a signe. The day following all things being in a readiness, he was carried solemnly by his people with great clamour and counterfeit mourning, to be interred in the chief <HI>Church</HI> of the <HI>City,</HI> where the Bishop and the Consul accompani|ed with all the chief men of the city came to honour the Buriall; but as soon as the Bishop had made himselfe ready to bury the corps, (most of the Towns-men being in the <HI>Church</HI>) <HI>Hasting</HI> stepped up all armed with his sword drawn, and first killed the Bishop and the Consul, and then fell with his armed Souldiers upon the naked peo|ple, and destroyed them in a manner every one, putting all to the sword, sparing neither sex, age, or infirmity.

<P>&para; After the death of <HI>Roderic</HI> the <HI>Great,</HI> the Northern <HI>Bri|tains</HI> of <HI>Stratclwyd</HI> and <HI>Cumberland,</HI> were (as <HI>Hector Boetius</HI> and <HI>Buchanan</HI> relate) much infested and weakned with the daily in|cursions of <HI>Danes, Saxons</HI> and <HI>Scots;</HI> which made many of them (all that would not submit their necks to the yoake) to quit their Country, and seek out more quiet habitations. Un|der the Conduct of one <HI>Hobert</HI> they came to <HI>Gwyneth</HI> in the beginning of <HI>Anarawd's</HI> Reigne, who commiserating their di|stressed condition gave them the <HI>Country</HI> from <HI>Chester</HI> to the River <HI>Conwey</HI> to inhabit, if they could beat out the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who had lately possessed themselves thereof. These <HI>Brytains</HI> ha|ving returned thanks to their Cousen <HI>Anarawd</HI> as was meet, fell upon the <HI>Saxons,</HI> and, necessity giving edge to their valour, soon drove them out thence, being yet scarce warme in their seats. About three years after this A. D. 880 <HI>Edryd Wallth&icirc;r</HI> King of the <HI>Saxons</HI> (called by the <HI>English</HI> Historians <HI>Eadred</HI> Duke of <HI>Mercia</HI>) made great preparations for the regaining of the said <HI>Country;</HI> But the Northern <HI>Brytains,</HI> who had settled themselves there, having intelligence thereof, for the better se|curing of their Cattel and goods, removed them over the river <HI>Conwey.</HI> In the mean time <HI>P.

This Battel was called <HI>Gwaeth Cymryt Conwey</HI> because it was fought in the Towneship of <HI>Cymryt</HI> hard by <HI>Conwey,</HI> but <HI>Anarawd</HI> called it <HI>Dial Rodri,</HI> because he had th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">re revenged&punc; the death of his Father <HI>Rodri.</HI> In this battel <HI>Tudwal</HI> the sonne of <HI>Rodri Mawr</HI> received a hurt in the knee, which made him be called&punc; <HI>Tudwal gl&ocirc;ff</HI> or the <HI>Lame</HI> e|ver after; his Brethren to reward his valour and service gave him <HI>Uchellogoed Gwynedd;</HI> The <HI>Brytains</HI> pursuing their vi|ctory, chased the <HI>Saxons</HI> quite out of <HI>Wales</HI> into <HI>Mercia,</HI> where having burne and destroyed the Borders they returned home laden with rich spoyles.

<P>&fleurdelys; The cause why <HI>Edward</HI> disinherited this young Lady his own Neece, whose mother <HI>Elfled</HI> his sister had done so much for him, was (as <HI>Castoreus</HI> writeth) for that <HI>Alfwyen</HI> not making the King her Uncle (whom her Mother had appointed guardian and over|seer of her) privy to her doings, had promised and contracted marriage with <HI>Raynald</HI> King of the <HI>Danes:</HI> whereupon King <HI>Ed|ward,</HI> to prevent his enemy, entred the land of <HI>Mercia,</HI> and seazed the same to his own hands, and carried also the said Lady with him into <HI>Westsex.</HI> The same Author also reporteth, that about this time <HI>Leofred</HI> a <HI>Dane,</HI> and <HI>Gruffyth</HI> ap <HI>Madoc,</HI> brother in law to the Prince of <HI>Westwales,</HI> came from <HI>Ireland</HI> with a great Army to <HI>Snowdon,</HI> and minding to bring all <HI>Wales</HI> and the <HI>Marches</HI> thereof to their subjection, overran and subdued all the Country to <HI>Chester,</HI> before King <HI>Edward</HI> had notice of their arrivall.

This <HI>Howel</HI> constituted and made Lawes to be observed throughout his Dominions, which were in use in <HI>Wales,</HI> till the Inhabitants received the lawes of <HI>England</HI> which was in the time of <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and in some places thereof long after. These Lawes are at this day to be seen in <HI>Latine</HI> and in <HI>Welsh.</HI></P>
<P>&fleurdelys; <HI>Howel Dha</HI> King of all <HI>Wales</HI> perceiving the Lawes and customes of his Country to have growne into great abuse, and disregard, summoned the Archbishop of <HI>Menevia,</HI> with all the other Bishops and <HI>Chiefe</HI> of the <HI>Clergy</HI> to the number of <HI>140 Pre|lates,</HI> and all the <HI>Barons</HI> and <HI>Nobles</HI> of <HI>Wales,</HI> with six men of the Wisest and best reputed in every Commot to meet all together at his house called <HI>Y Tuy gwyn ar Taf,</HI> that is, The <HI>White house</HI> upon the River <HI>Taf</HI> (in <HI>Carmarthenshire:</HI>) Thither he came him|selfe, and continued there with those his Nobles, Prelates vnd Sub|jects all the <HI>Lent</HI> in Prayer and Fasting, craving the direction and blessing of Gods holy spirit upon his endeavour to reforme the Lawes and Customes of his Country, to the honour of God, and the good of his people. About the end of <HI>Lent</HI> he chose out of that com|pany twelve of the wisest, gravest, and of greatest experience among them: to whom he added one <HI>Clerke</HI> or <HI>Doctor</HI> of the <HI>Lawes,</HI> na|med <HI>Blegored,</HI> a learned and perfect wise man. These had in
<PB N="73" REF="49">
charge to examine the old Laws and Customes of <HI>Wales,</HI> and to gather out of them such as were meet for the government of the Country: which they did, retaining those that were wholesome and profitable, expounding those that were doubtfull and ambigu|ous, and abrogating those that were superfluous and hurtfull, and so ordained three sorts of Laws. The first, of the Ordering of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.</NOTE> <HI>Kings</HI> or <HI>Princes</HI> houshold, and his <HI>Court.</HI> The second, of the Af|fairs<NOTE PLACE="marg">2.</NOTE> of the <HI>Country</HI> and Common-wealth. The third, of the spe|ciall<NOTE PLACE="marg">3.</NOTE> <HI>Customes</HI> belonging to particular places and persons. All these being read, Proclaimed, and Allowed, he caused three seve|rall Books of them to be written, one for his daily use to follow his Court, another to lye in his Palace at <HI>Aberffraw,</HI> and the third at <HI>Dinevowr,</HI> that all the three Provinces of <HI>Wales</HI> might have the use of the same when need required. And for the better observati|on of these Lawes, he caused the Archbishop of <HI>St Davids</HI> to de|nounce sentence of Excommunication against all such of his Sub|jects, as should refuse to obey them. Within a while after <HI>Howel</HI> (because he would omit nothing that might procure strength and Authority to his said Laws) went to <HI>Rome</HI> taking along with him, the Archbishop of <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mordef.</NOTE> <HI>S.

<P>After his death, <HI>Edred</HI> or <HI>Edfred</HI> his Brother was Crow|ned in his stead, who making an expedition into <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Northumberland</HI> subdued both the <HI>Northumbers</HI> and <HI>Scots</HI> promising fealty and homage by Oath, which was not long kept. In the yeare 948 died <HI>Howel Dha</HI> the Noble and<NOTE PLACE="marg">948.</NOTE> worthy King of <HI>Wales,</HI> whose death was much bewailed by all men, for he was a <HI>Prince</HI> that loved Peace and good Or|der, and that truly feared God. He left behind him four sonnes, <HI>Owen, Run, Roderike,</HI> and <HI>Edwyn,</HI> betwixt whom and the sonnes of <HI>Edwal,</HI> there ensued great Warres, for the chief Rule of <HI>Wales,</HI> as shall appeare in the History follow|ing.</P>
<P>&para; The sonnes of <HI>Howel Dha,</HI> as some Writers doe record it, were these, <HI>viz. Owen,</HI> who did not live long after his Fa|ther, <HI>Eneon, Meredyth, Dyfnwal, Rodri,</HI> the two last whereof, as is conceived, were slaine in the Battell fought neare <HI>Llanrwst</HI> A. D. 952 by the sonnes of <HI>Edwal Voel. Run</HI> Lord of <HI>Cardi|gan</HI> and slaine before the death of his Father. <HI>Conan y Cwn</HI> who possessed <HI>Anglesey. Edwin,</HI> who was also slaine, as is sup|posed, in the forementioned battell. <HI>Owen</HI> ap <HI>Howel Dha</HI> dyed about the same time.</P>
<P>There was a battell fought between <HI>Howel</HI> and <HI>Conan</HI> ap <HI>Ed|wal Voel</HI> for the Ile of <HI>Anglesey,</HI> wherein <HI>Conan</HI> fell; <HI>Griffith</HI> his sonne renewing the Warre was overcome. And <HI>Cyngar</HI> a po|tent man being driven out of the Ile <HI>Howel</HI> enjoyed quiet pos|session thereof, and of the rest of <HI>Gwyneth.</HI></P>
<P>I suppose <HI>Howel Dha</HI> was chosen to rule <HI>Wales</HI> during the minority of the sonnes of his Unkle <HI>Anarawd,</HI> who at the death of their Father were very young and not fit for Gover|ment: we have it in some copies of his <HI>Laws</HI> that in the year of our Lord 914 (soon after the death of <HI>Anarawd</HI>) he summo|ned the Arch-Bishops, Bishops, the rest of the Clergy with the<NOTE PLACE="marg">914</NOTE> Lords of <HI>Wales,</HI> and six of the most discreet Freeholders out of
