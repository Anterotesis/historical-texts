<P>_POre Pilgrimes v&s;e, Right wor&s;hipfull &s;ir, that after their wearie iournies, &amp; re|turne into their natiue &s;oile, to communicate the troth, of anie thing worthie to be knowen and of them &s;eene, among their e&s;|peciall friends which are learned, and al&s;o louers of &s;uch kinde of vocation. The holy &s;cripture &s;heweth vs, that when the wi&s;e men called Magi, being led by a &s;traunge &s;tarre, to the place where Chri&s;t our Sauior was borne, at which place the &s;tarre did not only &s;taie, but al&s;o gaue a wonderful bright|nes with &s;hining beams, to a&s;&s;ure them that there the Sauiour was. Vndoubtedly the&s;e men letted not to declare the&s;e maruailous things &amp; vi&s;ions, at their returne, as appea|reth at this pre&s;ent, that in Aethiopia &amp; the Ea&s;t Countries, are an infinite number of Chri&s;tians&punc; Likewi&s;e the Eunuch, me&s;&s;enger to the Queene of Candace, letted not to manife&s;t in his Countrie, the miraculous things that he had &s;eene in Ieru&s;alem when

Chri&s;t our Redeemer &s;uffered the mo&s;t bit|ter death of the cro&s;&s;e. Nor yet the Queene of Sabba, kept in &s;ecret the wi&s;dome of Sa|lomon.</P>
<P>But the cau&s;e Right wor&s;hipfull, that I tooke this little Pamphlet in hand, was tho|rough the writing of Andrewe Theuet a Frenchman, who wrote of the Fortunate I|landes by heare&s;ay: But I poore Pilgrime maie call tho&s;e Ilands infortunate: for there was I apprehended for an heretike and an open enimie to the Romi&s;h Churche, and there deteyned in that bloudie Inqui&s;ition, the &s;pace of fiue yeares, &amp; now come home to offer this little worke to your wor&s;hip, becau&s;e your helping hand is alwaies ready to fauor and further anie vertuous or good attempt. Be&s;eeching your wor&s;hip to ac|cept it, &amp; to con&s;ider that poore Pilgrimes haue not any other thing to giue, &amp; the Al|mightie graunt your hearts de&s;ire.</P>

<HEAD>&para; A DESCRIPTI|on <HI>of the fortunate Ilandes,</HI> now called the Ilandes of Canaria, with their perticular Com|modities.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_PLATO</HI> in his <HI>Thimeo,</HI> writeth, that about 750. yeres pa&s;t, ther was a great Ilande lieng in the Ocean Sea, in Front of <HI>Hercules</HI> Pillers, which &s;tood at that time in the Iland of <HI>Cadez,</HI> this Ilande was called <HI>Atlantica,</HI> which lande by Gods permi&s;&s;ion &s;onke, &s;auing certaine I|lands which yet remaine called the Ilands of <HI>Cabo Verde,</HI> the Ilands of <HI>Canaria,</HI> and the Ilands of <HI>Azores</HI> and others.</P>
<P>The opinion of <HI>Plato</HI> &s;&eacute;emeth to be true, becau&s;e the Coa&s;t of <HI>Grunea</HI> hath &s;ands &amp; &s;hallowes lying out a great way into the maine Ocean, which agr&eacute;eth as parcell appertayning to the other Ilandes be|fore rehear&s;ed. Some of the <HI>Canaria</HI> I|lands as the Ile of <HI>Fortauentura</HI> by name, lyeth 50. leagues di&s;taunt from the conti|nent land of <HI>Africa,</HI> and the Ilands of <HI>A|zores</HI> n&eacute;ere 300. leagues.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">The opinion of <HI>Plato</HI> &s;hall &s;erue for this purpo&s;e, to the which I remit me. Be|cau&s;e mine inte~t is, particularly to &s;peak of the <HI>Canaria</HI> Ilands, which are &s;euen in number, wherein I dwelt the &s;pace of vij. yeares and more, becau&s;e I finde &s;uch va|rietie in &s;undry writers, &amp; e&s;pecially great vntrothes, in a booke called the new found worlde Antartike, &s;et out by a French man called <HI>Andrew Theuet,</HI> the which his booke he dedicated to the Cardinall of <HI>Sens,</HI> keeper of the gteat &s;eale of <HI>Fraunce.</HI></P>
<P>It appeareth by the &s;aid booke that h&eacute;e had read y^e works of &s;undrie philo&s;ophers, A&s;tronomers, &amp; Co&s;mographers, who&s;e opi|nions he gathered together. But touching his owne trauaile which h&eacute;e affirmeth, I referre to the iudgement of the experient in our daies, and therefore for mine owne part I write of the&s;e <HI>Canaria</HI> Ilandes, as time hath taught me in manie yeares.</P>

<HEAD>The Iland of Canaria.</HEAD>
<P>THE Iland of <HI>Canaria</HI> is almo&s;t com|parable in length to breadth, contey|ning 12. leagues in length, touching the which as principall &amp; the re&s;idue, the <HI>Spa|niards</HI>
<PB REF="4">
hold opinion, y^t they di&s;couered it in their nauigation toward <HI>America,</HI> but the <HI>Portingals</HI> &s;ay, that their nation fir&s;t found the &s;aid Ilandes, in their Nauigation to|ward <HI>Aethiopia</HI> and Ea&s;t <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>But truth it is that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> fir&s;t conquered the&s;e Ilands, with diuers Eng|li&s;h Gentlemen in their companie, who&s;e de&s;cendents this pre&s;ent daie inioyeth the~. Some write that this Iland was named <HI>Canaria</HI> by meane of the number of dogs which there were found. As for example, <HI>Andrew Theuet</HI> &s;aith, y^e one <HI>Iuba</HI> carryed two dogges from thence: but that opinion could I neuer learne by anie of the natu|rall people of the Countrie, although I haue talked with many in my time, &amp; with many of their children. For truth it is, that there were dogges, but &s;uch as are in all the Norwe&s;t lands, and &s;ome parte of y^e We&s;t <HI>India,</HI> which &s;erued the people in &s;t&eacute;ed of &s;h&eacute;epe for victuall. But of &s;ome of the conquerours of tho&s;e Ilandes I haue heard &s;ay, that the rea&s;on why they were called <HI>Canaria</HI> Ilands, is, there groweth generally in them all, a foure &s;quare cane in great multitude together, which in tou|ching them wil ca&s;t out a liquor as white
<PB REF="5">
as milke, which liquor is ranke poy&s;on, and at the fir&s;t entrie into the&s;e Ilandes, &s;ome of the di&s;couerers were therewith poy&s;oned: for many yeares after that con|que&s;t, the inhabitants began to plant both wine and Sugar, &s;o that <HI>Canaria</HI> was not &s;o called by Sugar canes.</P>
<P>The people which fir&s;t inhabited this lande were called <HI>Canaries</HI> by the conque|rours, they were clothed in goate &s;kinnes made like vnto a loo&s;e ca&s;&s;ocke, they dwelt in caues in the Rockes, in great amitie &amp; brotherly loue. They &s;pake all one lan|guage, their chiefe f&eacute;eding was gelt dogs, goates, and goates milke, their bread was made of Barlie meale and Goats milke, called <HI>Gofia,</HI> which they v&s;e at this daie, and thereof I haue eaten diuer&s;e times, for it is accounted exc&eacute;eding whole&s;ome.</P>
<P>Touching the originall of the&s;e people, &s;ome holde opinion, y^t the <HI>Romanes</HI> which dwelt in <HI>Africa</HI> exiled them thether, as well men as women, their tongues b&eacute;eing cutte out of their heades, for bla&s;phe|mie again&s;t the Romane Gods. But how|&s;oeuer it were, their language was &s;peci|all, and not mixed with Romane &s;p&eacute;ech or Arabian.</P>
<P><PB REF="5">This Iland is now the principalle&s;t of all the re&s;t, not in fertilitie, but by rea&s;on it is the &s;eate of Iu&s;tice and gouernment of all the re&s;idue. This Ilande hath a &s;peciall Gouernor for the Iland onely, yet notwith&s;tanding there are thr&eacute;e Iudges called Auditours, who are &s;uperiour Iud|ges, and all in one iointly proc&eacute;ede as the Lord Chanceller of anie realme.</P>
<P>To this Citie from all the other I|lands come al &s;uch by appeale, as haue &s;u|&s;tained any wrong, and the&s;e good Iudges doo remedie the &s;ame. The Citie is called <HI>Ciuitas Palmarum,</HI> it hath a beautifull Cathedrall Church, with all dignities therevnto pertaining. For the publike weale of the Iland ther are &s;undrie Alder|men of great authoritie, who haue a coun|&s;ell hou&s;e by them&s;elues. The Citie is not onely beautifull, but the citizens curious and gallant in apparell. And after anie raine or foule weather a man maye goe cleane in Veluet &s;lippers, becau&s;e y^e ground is &s;andie, the aire verie temperate, without extreame heat or colde.</P>
<P>They reape wheate in Februarie, and againe in Maie, which is excellent good, &amp; maketh bread as white as &s;now. This I|land
<PB REF="6">
hath in it other thr&eacute;e faire townes, the one called <HI>Telde,</HI> and y^e &s;econd <HI>Galder</HI> the third <HI>Guia.</HI> It hath al&s;o 12. Sugar hou&s;es called <HI>Iugenios,</HI> in which they make great quantitie of good &s;ugar.</P>
<P>The manner of the growth of Sugar is in this &s;ort, a good ground giueth &s;oorth fruit nine times in 18. y&eacute;ere. That is to &s;aie, the fir&s;t is called <HI>Planta</HI> which is laid a long in a vorrowe, &s;o that the water of a &s;luce may come ouer euerie roote being co|uered with earth: this roote bringeth forth &s;undrie canes, and &s;o con&s;equently all the re&s;t. It groweth two yeares before the y&eacute;elding of profit, and not &s;ixe monethes, as <HI>Andrew Theuet</HI> the French man wri|teth.</P>
<P>Then are they cut euen with the ground, and the tops and leaues called <HI>Coholia</HI> cut off, and the canes bound into bundels like faggets, &amp; &s;o are carried to the &s;ugar hou&s;e called <HI>Iugenio,</HI> where they are ground in a mill, and the iuyce thereof conuayed by conduct to a great ve&s;&s;ell made for the purpo&s;e, where it is boyled till it waxe thicke, and then is it put into a fornaice or earthen pots of the moulde of a Sugar loafe, &amp; then is it carryed to another hou&s;e,
<PB REF="6">
called a purging hou&s;e, where it is placed to purge the blacknes with a certain clay that is laid thereon. Of the remainder in the cauldron is made a &s;econd &s;ort called <HI>E&s;cumas,</HI> and of the purging liquor that droppeth from the white Sugar is made a third &s;ort, and the remainder is called <HI>Panela</HI> or <HI>Netas,</HI> the refu&s;e of all the purg|ing is called <HI>Remiel</HI> or <HI>Malla&s;&s;es:</HI> and ther|of is made another &s;ort called <HI>Refinnado.</HI></P>
<P>When this fir&s;t fruit is in this &s;orte gathered called <HI>Planta,</HI> then the Cane field where it grew, is burned ouer with Su|gar &s;traw to the &s;tumps of the fir&s;t canes, and being hu&s;banded, watred &amp; trimmed, at y^e end of other two yeres, it y&eacute;eldeth the &s;econd fruite called <HI>Zoca.</HI> The third fruite is called <HI>Tercia Zoca,</HI> the fourth <HI>Quarta Zoca,</HI> and &s;o orderly the re&s;t till age cau|&s;eth the olde Canes to be planted againe.</P>
<P>This Iland hath &s;ingular good wine, e&s;pecially in the towne of <HI>Telde,</HI> and &s;un|drie &s;ortes of good frutes, as Batata, Mel|lons, peares, Apples, Orenges, Lemmons. Pomegranads, Figs, Peaches of diuer&s;e &s;ortes, and many other fruites: but e&s;peci|allye the <HI>Plantano</HI> which groweth n&eacute;ere brooke &s;ides, it is a tr&eacute;e that hath no Tim|ber
<PB REF="7">
in it, but groweth directly vpward w^t y^e bodie hauing maruailous thick leaues, &amp; euery leafe at the toppe of two yeardes long and almo&s;t halfe a yearde broade.</P>
<P>The Tr&eacute;e neuer y&eacute;eldeth fruite but once, and then is cut down, in who&s;e place &s;pringeth another, and &s;o &s;till continueth. The fruit groweth on a braunch, and eue|rie tr&eacute;e y&eacute;eldeth two or thr&eacute;e of tho&s;e bran|ches, which beareth &s;ome more and &s;ome le&s;&s;e, as &s;ome 40. and &s;ome 30. the fruit is like a Cowcumber, and when it is ripe it is blacke, and in eating more delicate then anye con&s;erue. This Ilande is &s;uffici|entlye prouided of Oxen Kine, Camelles, Goates, &s;h&eacute;epe, Capons, Hens, Ducks, and Pidgeons, and great Partridges. Woode is the thing that mo&s;t wanteth: and be|cau&s;e I haue perticularly to deale of the other &s;ixe Ilands, I leaue further inlarg|ing of <HI>Canaria,</HI> which &s;tandeth in 27. de|gr&eacute;es di&s;tant from the <HI>Aequator.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Ile of Tenerif.</HEAD>
<P>THE Iland of <HI>Tenerif</HI> &s;tandeth in 27. degr&eacute;es &amp; a halfe, from the equator, &amp; is di&s;ta~t fro~ <HI>Canaria</HI> 12. leagues, Northward.
<PB REF="7">
This Ilande conteineth 17. leagues in length, and the land lyeth high in forme of a ridge of &s;owen lande in &s;ome parte of <HI>England,</HI> and in the midde&s;t of the &s;ayde place &s;tandeth a round hill called <HI>Pico De|teythe,</HI> &s;cituated of this &s;ort. The toppe of this pike conteineth of height directly vp|ward 15. leagues and more, which is 45. Engli&s;h miles, out of the which often|times proc&eacute;edeth fire and brim&s;tone, &amp; may be about halfe a mile compa&s;&s;e: the &s;ayde toppe is in forme or likene&s;&s;e of a caldron. But within two miles of y^e top is nothing but a&s;hes and pomi&s;h &s;tones: yet beneath that two miles, is the colde region couered all the yeare with Snowe, and &s;omewhat lower are mightie huge tr&eacute;es growing called <HI>Vinatico</HI> which is exc&eacute;eding heauie, and will not rot in anie water, although it lye a thou&s;and y&eacute;eres therein. Al&s;o there is a wood called <HI>Barbu&s;ano,</HI> of like vertue, with many Sauine tr&eacute;es and Pine tr&eacute;es. And beneath this &s;orts of tr&eacute;es are woods of Baie tr&eacute;es, of x. &amp; 12. miles long, which is a plea&s;ant thing to trauaile through, a|mong y^e which are great numbers of &s;mall birdes, which &s;ing exc&eacute;eding &s;w&eacute;ete: but e&s;|pecially one &s;ort that are verie little, and
<PB REF="8">
of coulour in all re&s;pects like a Swallow, &s;auing he hath a little blacke &s;pot on his brea&s;t as broade as a pennie. He &s;ingeth more &s;w&eacute;eter then all the re&s;t, but if he be taken and impri&s;oned in a cage, he liueth but a &s;mall while. This Iland bringeth forth all &s;ortes of fruites as <HI>Canaria</HI> doth, and al&s;o all the other Ilands in generall, bringeth forth &s;hrubbes or bru&s;hes, out of the which i&s;&s;ueth a iuyce as white as milke, which after a while that it hath come out waxeth thicke, and is exc&eacute;eding good Birdlime, the bu&s;h is called <HI>Taybay|ba.</HI> This Iland al&s;o bringeth forth another tr&eacute;e called <HI>Drago,</HI> which groweth on high among rockes, and by inci&s;&s;ion at the foote of the tr&eacute;e i&s;&s;ueth out a liquor like bloud, &amp; is a common drugge among Apothecaries. Of the wood of this tr&eacute;e are made targets greatly e&s;t&eacute;emed, becau&s;e if anie &s;word or dagger hit thereon, they &s;ticke &s;o fa&s;t that it is hard plucking them out.</P>
<P>This is the mo&s;t fruitfulle&s;t Iland of all the re&s;t for corne, and in that re&s;pect is a mother or nur&s;e to al y^e others in time of n&eacute;ed. There groweth al&s;o a certaine mo&s;&s;e vpon the high rockes called <HI>Orchel,</HI> which is bought for Diars to die withall. There
<PB REF="8">
are 12. <HI>Ingenios</HI> called &s;ugar hou&s;es, which make great quantitie of Sugar.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o one league of grounde which &s;ta~deth betw&eacute;ene two towns, y^e one called <HI>Larotaua,</HI> &amp; the other <HI>Rialeio,</HI> which is thought that the like plot of ground is not in all the world. The rea&s;on is, that this one league of ground produceth &s;w&eacute;et water out of the cliffes or rockie moun|taines, corne of all &s;ortes, fruites of all &s;ortes, and excellent good &s;ilke, flaxe, waxe, and honnie, and verie good wines in abun|dance, with great &s;tore of Sugar and fire woode. Out of this Iland is laden greate quantitie of wines for the we&s;t <HI>India,</HI> and other Countries. The be&s;t groweth on a hill &s;ide called the <HI>Ramble.</HI></P>
<P>There is in that Iland a faire Citie, &s;tanding thr&eacute;e leagues from the &s;ea, n&eacute;ere vnto a lake called <HI>Laguna,</HI> wherin are two faire Pari&s;h Churches, there dwelleth the gouernour who ruleth al that Iland with iu&s;tice. There are al&s;o Aldermen for the publike weale, who buy their offices of the king: the mo&s;t of the whole inhabitants of this Citie are Gentlemen, Merchants, and hu&s;band men.</P>
<P>There are other foure Townes called
<PB REF="9">
<HI>Sancta Crux, Larotaua, Rialeio,</HI> and <HI>Gara|chico?</HI></P>
<P>In this Iland before the conque&s;t dwelt &s;eauen kinges, who with all their people dwelt in caues, and were cloathed in goat &s;kinnes, as the <HI>Canaria</HI> people were, and with &s;uch like order of dyet as they had. Their order of buriall was, that when a|nie died, he was carried naked to a greate caue, where he was propped vp again&s;t the wall &s;tanding on his f&eacute;ete. But if he were of anie authoritie among them, then had h&eacute;e a &s;taffe in his hand, &amp; a ve&s;&s;ell of milke &s;tanding by him. I haue &s;&eacute;ene caues of 300. of the&s;e corps together, the fle&s;h b&eacute;eing dryed vp, the bodie remained as light as parchment. The&s;e people were called <HI>Gua~|ches,</HI> by naturall name they &s;pake another language cleane contrarie to the <HI>Canari|ans,</HI> and &s;o con&s;eque~tly euerie Iland &s;pake a &s;euerall language. Note gentle Rea|der that the Ilande of <HI>Canaria,</HI> the Ile of <HI>Tenerif,</HI> and the Ile of <HI>Palme</HI> appertaine to the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> vnto whome they rent fiftie thou&s;and Duckets y&eacute;erely for cu&s;tome &amp; other profits. All the&s;e Ilandes ioyntly are one Bi&s;hoprick, which rent to the Bi&s;hop is 12. thou&s;and duckets y&eacute;erly,

It is an Earle|dome, and the Lord thereof is called, the Earle of <HI>Gomera.</HI> But in ca&s;e of anie con|trouer&s;ie the va&s;&s;alls may appeale to the kings &s;uperiour Iudges which re&s;ide in <HI>Canaria.</HI></P>
