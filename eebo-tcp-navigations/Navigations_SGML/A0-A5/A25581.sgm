<HEAD>AN ANSWER TO THE CASE OF THE Old <HI>EAST-INDIA</HI> Company;</HEAD>
<P>THE Companies Ca&s;e &s;hall be an&s;wer'd in the Method it is &s;tated by them&s;elves, not that they have given a true State of it with re&s;pect to the Act lately pa&s;&s;ed (for that is quite otherwi&s;e, as &s;hall afterwards be &s;hown) but to take of the Clamour which is made of invading their Property, depriving them of their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Right, ruining many Families, and the like; and therefore having to deal with Per&s;ons, who will not an&s;wer what is &s;aid or objected to them, only continue to make Popular Outcries they mu&s;t be followed in their own way, till the Noi&s;e is
<PB N="2" REF="3">abated, and their Pa&s;&s;ions laid, and then it is to be hoped they will li&s;ten to Rea&s;on, and con&s;ider the Ca&s;e as it truly &s;tands, and &s;hall before I fini&s;h be faithfully repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>The Company <HI>pag.</HI> 1, 2. recite &s;o much, as they think for their purpo&s;e of the Charters granted by Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> King <HI>James,</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>2d.</HI> and King <HI>James</HI> the <HI>2d.</HI> wherein is &s;ugge&s;ted, <HI>That the &s;ame was for the Honour of</HI> England, <HI>for the Encrea&s;e of Navigation, and the Advance of Trade, and the like:</HI> And I &s;hall readily grant the Trade to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> to be &s;uch, becau&s;e I really think it &s;o, and not be|cau&s;e of tho&s;e Sugge&s;tions in the Charters, for it is well enough known, that tho&s;e who draw the Char|ters, do not think them&s;elves obliged to the &s;tricte&s;t Examinations of the Sugge&s;tions, or to an&s;wer for the exact Truth of them.</P>
<P><HI>But the &s;aid Charters</HI> (&s;ay the Company, <HI>pag.</HI> 2.) <HI>contain a Grant of the Trade to the</HI> Ea&s;t Indies; <HI>to the Company exclu&s;ive of all others, and by &s;ome of them they are con&s;tituted the Lords Proprietors of Bombacy, and that the perpetual Propriety of the I&s;land of</HI> Sancta Helena <HI>is afterwards granted to them, and that by the&s;e Grants they are induced to think they have a Right in Law to the Trade, at lea&s;t that they &s;hould have an &V;n|controverted Title to the Lands, Inheritance,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And that on this pre&s;umption; and relying on the Publick Faith and Credit of the Great Seal of</HI> England, <HI>the Company have expended above a Million on the Credit of the&s;e Charters in Fortifications,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And</HI> pag. 3. <HI>That in pro&s;pect of this Right, they have acquired Re|venues of</HI> 44000 l. per Annum, <HI>and many Settlements and Priviledges.</HI></P>
<P>In the Recital of the&s;e Charters, the Company
<PB N="3" REF="3">have omitted to give an Account of the Provi&s;oes in&s;erted therein, <HI>viz. That the re&s;pective Kings grant|ing the &s;aid Charters re&s;erved Power upon three Years Notice to make them void:</HI> But that being al&s;o a Condition in their la&s;t Charter, will come into Con&s;ideration afterwards.</P>
<P>As to the Right they pretend to the Trade ex|clu&s;ive of others, I do not find one Word &s;aid through|out their whole Ca&s;e, to prove or maintain any &s;uch Right; and this might rea&s;onably have been expected from them. The &s;aying, <HI>They were induced to think they had a Right, and that upon that Pre&s;umption they expended Money and purcha&s;ed Territories,</HI> &amp;c. When at the &s;ame time every Lawyer mu&s;t tell them, they had no &s;uch right, and that the King by his Charter could not grant any &s;uch Right exclu&s;ive of others, and that &s;everal Recoveries have been had again&s;t them as Law for pro&s;ecuting &s;uch pretended Right: What would this be termed in other Affairs, but downright Folly and Madne&s;s?</P>
<P>And as the Crown had not a Power to grant &s;uch Right, &s;o his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty hath not in Fact granted any &s;uch Right exclu&s;ive, therefore the New Sub|&s;cribers to the Old Company, had no Inducement to think <HI>they</HI> had any &s;uch Right, but if the Company <HI>(in their ca&s;e)</HI> mean that they had a Right to the Trade, equal with all other the King's Subjects who had no Charter, that is not denied, and being granted does not &s;erve their purpo&s;e, as will afterwards ap|pear.</P>
<P>The Company go on, <HI>pag.</HI> 3. to give an Account of the Declaration of the Hou&s;e of Commons and Hou&s;e of Lords, <HI>That the</HI> Ea&s;t-India <HI>Trade &s;hould be carried on in a Joint-Stock exclu&s;ive to all others,</HI> but
<PB N="4" REF="4">omit to mention their other Declaration, <HI>That it was lawful for all Per&s;ons to Trade thither, unle&s;s re&s;trained by Act of Parliament;</HI> and they take no Notice of the two Addre&s;&s;es, made by the Hou&s;e of Commons, of the <HI>6th.</HI> of <HI>Feb.</HI> 1691. and 25 <HI>Feb.</HI> 1692. to di&s;&s;olve the Company.</P>
<P>They mention Me&s;&s;age of his Maje&s;ty to the Hou&s;e of Commons of the <HI>14th.</HI> of <HI>Novemb.</HI> 1692. but very craftily (to &s;ay no wor&s;e) omit the mo&s;t material Part of the &s;aid Me&s;&s;age, <HI>viz. That his Ma|je&s;ty required the</HI> Ea&s;t-India <HI>Company to an&s;wer directly, whether they would &s;ubmit to &s;uch Regulations, as his Maje&s;ty &s;hould judge proper and mo&s;t likely to advance the Trade, and the Company having fully agreed to it, and declared their Re&s;olution in Writing, his Maje&s;ty commanded a Committee of his Privy Council to prepare Regulations, which they did, and offered them to the Com|pany; but the Company notwith&s;tanding their Declaration of Submi&s;&s;ion, rejected almo&s;t all the material Particulars, &s;o that his Maje&s;ty finding, that what po&s;&s;ibly the Hou&s;e of</HI> Commons <HI>might have expected, and indeed was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve this Trade, could not be perfected by his own Authority alone, and that the Company could not be induced to con&s;ent to any &s;uch Regulations, as might have an&s;wered the Intentions of the Hou&s;e of</HI> Commons, <HI>and that the Concurrence of the Parliament is requi&s;ite to make a Compleat and &V;&s;eful Settlement of this Trade, has directed all the Proceedings in this Matter to be laid before them, and recommends to them the preparing &s;uch a Bill, in Oder to pa&s;s into an Act of Parliament, as may e&s;tabli&s;h this Trade on &s;uch Foundations, as are mo&s;t likely to pre&s;erve and advance it.</HI></P>
<P>The Company proceed to tell <HI>How it was &s;ugge&s;ted, that their Charter was become void by their Non-payment
<PB N="5" REF="4">of the Tax impo&s;ed upon them by Parliament, and how they the</HI> 7th. Octob. 1693. <HI>obtained a New Charter,</HI> but &s;ay nothing of the Eighty Odd Thou&s;and Pounds, paid out of the Companies Stock that &s;ame Year for the &s;pecial Service of the Company, and great part of it for obtaining the &s;aid Charter, as Sir <HI>T. C.</HI> gave an Account to the Committee of both Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment. Surely if the Company had a Right in Law, as they pretended <HI>they were induced to believe,</HI> there needed not &s;uch Chargeable and Strenuous Solici|tations.</P>
<P>And now we are come to the Charter it &s;elf granted by his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, which bears Date the <HI>7th. Octob.</HI> 1693. which was as they &s;ay, conte&s;ted before the Queen and Council by tho&s;e they call <HI>Interlopers,</HI> upon the Hearing whereof it plainly appeared and was unan&s;werably made out, that the King had not by Law, a Power to grant the Trade to &s;ome Per|&s;ons exclu&s;ive of others, and that the then Compa|nies Affairs were in &s;uch a Condition, that it would be a plain Cheat to others, that &s;hould come in upon their Stock. However Law and Rea&s;on failing, they had recour&s;e to other Means and grea Summs of Money were di&s;tributed (as it was acknowledged before a Committee of both Hou&s;es of Parliament) to get a New Charter for the Old Company, and at length a New Charter was obtained, but tho&s;e who were concerned to advi&s;e his Maje&s;ty in point of Law, were &s;o ju&s;t to their Tru&s;t as to take care that no Right of Trade exclu&s;ive of others was granted, and al&s;o that the Company &s;hould &s;ubmit to &s;uch Alterations, Re&s;trictions and Qualifications, as the King &s;hould make before the <HI>29th. Septemb.</HI> following, and &s;o on the <HI>17th. Novemb.</HI> a New
<PB N="6" REF="5">Chapter of Regulations was made, and another the <HI>28th. Septemb.</HI> 1694. Wherein (among&s;t other things) was the Provi&s;o before mentioned, <HI>That if it &s;hall appear to the King, his Heirs and Succe&s;&s;ors, that the &s;aid two Charters or any other Charters here+tofore granted, &s;hall not be profitable to the King, his Heirs or Succe&s;&s;ors, or to this Realm, that then and from thenceforth, upon and after three Years Warning to be given to the &s;aid Company, by he King, his Heirs or Succe&s;&s;ors, under his or their Privy Seal or Signit Manual the &s;everal Letters Pattents,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>&s;hall cea&s;e, be void, and be determined.</HI></P>
<P><HI>&V;pon the Security of this Charter, the Company &s;ay,</HI> pag. 4. <HI>they con&s;ented to a New Sub&s;cription, and that there was anew &s;ub&s;cribed</HI> 744000 l. <HI>and the Money brought in during the Sitting of the Parliament, and that nothing was done, &s;aid or offered, again&s;t the Char|ter of Regulations; &s;o that upon the Publick Faith, (at lea&s;t tacitly given)</HI> 781 <HI>New Adventurers, of which many are Widows and Orphans, did &s;ub&s;cribe a large part of their Sub&s;tance to &s;upport this Trade, du|ring a Hazardous War for the Profit and Honour of</HI> England, <HI>and that the new Adventurers thought they might without any Hazard &s;ub&s;cribe on the Security of a Charter which was &s;o plainly de&s;igned by his Maje&s;ty, to pre&s;erve the</HI> Ea&s;t-India <HI>Traffick then in Danger of being lo&s;t.</HI> This is the Glo&s;s put upon that Tran&s;|action, but let us examine the Matter to the bottom, and then &s;ee whether it has not another Face.</P>
<P>How this Charter was obtained appears, by the Report of the Committee of the Honourable Hou&s;e of <HI>Commons,</HI> who finding great Summs of Mony paid for &s;pecial Service, and ob&s;erving that the greate&s;t Payment was in the Year 1693. they &s;earched for
<PB N="7" REF="5">the Orders for the I&s;&s;uing of that Money, the chief of which were One dated the <HI>13th. April,</HI> 1693. at a Court of Committees in the Words following.</P>
<P><HI>The Governour this Day acquainting the Court with what Proceedings had been made in their Affairs towards granting a new Charter, and which what had been disbur&s;ed by him in pro&s;ecution thereof, the Court approved of the &s;aid Charges, and ordered a Warrant to be made out for the &s;ame; and returned him thanks for his great Care, Pains and Trouble in their Service, de&s;iring him to pro|ceed in the perfecting thereof.</HI> Another was Dated the <HI>24th.</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> 1693. at a Court of Committees held the &s;ame Day. <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Governour this Day making a Repre&s;entation of what Summs of Money had been by him of lae disbur&s;ed, in the management and carrying on of the Companies, Af|fairs for their Service, the Court approved thereof, and ordered that a Warrant be made out for making the &s;ame paid in Ca&s;t accordingly, giving him their Thanks for his great Care and Pains taken therein.</HI> Another was at a Court of Committees holden the 22d. of <HI>January,</HI> 1693/4. in the Words following.</P>
<P><HI>It being repre&s;ented to the Court, that in the further Pro&s;ecution of the Companies Affairs, and in Order to their Settlement there have been &s;everal Summs of Money disbur&s;t, amounting to</HI> 30000 l. <HI>in the whole; the Par|ticulars whereof were now laid before them, on Con&s;idera|tion thereof had, it is Ordered, that the &s;aid Monies be made paid in Ca&s;h.</HI></P>
<Q><P>The &s;aid Committee of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Commons</HI> found by Examination of mo&s;t of the Per&s;ons pre|&s;ent at the afore&s;aid Committees, that the Gover|nour in the &s;aid Committees did only in General inform them what Summs he had disbur&s;t, with|out
<PB N="8" REF="6">naming the Particulars, to whom, or for what Service, which &s;everal of them &s;aid was a new Cour&s;e, &s;ince Sir <HI>T. C.</HI> came to be Deputy Gover|nour or Governour: but in all times before he was concerned, the Particulars of all Summs for the &s;pe|cial Service of the Company, were declared.</P>
<P>Further the &s;aid Committee found that in pur|&s;uance of the fir&s;t Order, dated the <HI>13th.</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> 22275 <HI>l.</HI> was paid out of Ca&s;h, in pur&s;uance of that Order, and 24983 <HI>l.</HI> in pur&s;uance of the next Order dated the <HI>24th.</HI> of <HI>November,</HI> 1693. and 30000 <HI>l.</HI> in pur&s;uance of the la&s;t Order of the 22d. <HI>Jan.</HI> 1693. Amounting in all to 77258 <HI>l.</HI> be&s;ides &s;everal &s;maller Summs amounting in the whole to 10144 <HI>l.</HI> 12 <HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>d.</HI> Which with the for|mer Summ makes &mdash; 87402 <HI>l.</HI> 12 <HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>d.</HI></P></Q>
<P>And what Security was to be expected from a Charter &s;o obtained, which had more in it (as it is to be feared) of Private Promi&s;es than Publick Faith, or &s;uch a Summ of Money was ill be&s;towed; and Sir <HI>B. F.</HI> on his Examination on Oath, acknowledged he had &s;aid to one with whom he treated, that he would not let the Companies Money go for nothing, &s;o that it is not to be wondred, that the Parliament took no Notice of the Matter whil&s;t the Money was paying in, when it is con&s;idered what is &s;aid above, and Sir <HI>T. C.</HI> (among&s;t other things) acquainted the Committee of both Hou&s;es, <HI>That there were &s;e|veral Contracts, &s;ome to the Value of</HI> 60000 l. <HI>on Ac|count of procuring a new Charter, and others to ther Value of</HI> 40000 l. <HI>on Account of procuring an Act of Parliament:</HI> By &s;uch means it might be hu&s;h'd for a while, but it was not long before the Parliament took Publick Notice of it, and if the greater Affairs
<PB N="9" REF="6">of the Nation had not been &s;o urgent, and the Se&s;&s;ions been &s;o near an End, perhaps the Company might have had Ju&s;tice done them then, and been pa&s;t com|plaining of any Imaginary Inju&s;tice done them now.</P>
<P>It appears therefore very plainly, that it was not for the Profit and Honour of the Nation, and to &s;up|port the Trade, that the New Sub&s;cribers came in, but they were deluded into it by a Charter obtained by In|direct Means, and by the hopes of an Act of Parliament to confirm it, to be obtained in the &s;ame Manner.</P>
<P>The Trade would have been much better pre&s;erved, and more to the Honour of the Nation, if no &s;uch underhand Practices had been carried on; and if &s;ome Per&s;ons thinking them&s;elves to have a greater reach than others, or being deceived by the Old Companies mak|ing his Maje&s;ty believe their Stock to be worth 750000 <HI>l.</HI> and by afterwards &s;haring 325000 <HI>l.</HI> of the New Sub&s;cribers Money among&s;t them&s;elves, or by the Per&s;ons failing them who had promi&s;ed to get an Act of Parliament, or by Lo&s;&s;es at Sea, or by what other Means &s;oever it were, happened to fail in their Expectation, who are an&s;werable for it but them&s;elves? If any Widows were drawn in, it was but few, and that not for much, to be &s;ure; but that's a &s;tate Cry, and they and all others had Warn|ing enough by the Tran&s;actions before the Council, and by publick Prints, in one of which Entituled, <HI>Rea&s;ons propo&s;ed for the Encouragement of all People to underwrite to the New Sub&s;criptions, appointed to be made to the late</HI> Ea&s;t-India <HI>Companies Stock;</HI> after an Ac|count of their Affairs, this Caution was given <HI>pag.</HI> 7. <HI>If People will put out their Eyes, and always be thus bubbled out of their Money, as well as their Sen&s;es, they may go on till they are weary, and perhaps this is
<PB N="10" REF="7">done, that the old pretence might &s;till be urged for their Continuance,</HI> viz. <HI>That a great many Widows, Orphans, and Innocent, and Ignorant People might not be cheated and undone, if they &s;hould be di&s;&s;olved, but let not the &s;aid Gentlemen deceive them&s;elves and others, doubtle&s;s the Parliament will not be thus affronted, but will take notice of the&s;e Proceedings, and a&s;&s;ert the Right and Li|berty of the Subject to the Freedom of this Trade,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>If Per&s;ons will then adventure their Money after all this, they mu&s;t take their Fate, and I think if &s;uch a Pro|cedure e&s;capes cen&s;ure it is a happy I&s;&s;ue, though they come to &s;ome Lo&s;s. (not to &s;ay any thing of the Violences and Irregularities of the Old Company.) For,</P>
<P>10 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. One <HI>John Peach</HI> was arraigned at the Parliament Bar, for that he had obtained of the King a Monopoly for Sweet Wines. The Pattent after great Advice and Di&s;pute adjudged void, and before his Face in open Parliament cancelled, becau&s;e he had exacted 3 <HI>s.</HI> 4 <HI>d.</HI> for every Tun of Wine, him&s;elf adjudged to Pri&s;on, until he had made Re&s;titution of all that ever he had received, and not delivered till after a Fine of 500 <HI>l.</HI> paid to the King, which at that time was a great Summ of Money.</P>
<P>In Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s time upon Complaint in Par|liament of Pattents granted for Monopolies, mo&s;t of them were immediately revoked, and the re&s;t left to the Law.</P>
<P>In King <HI>James</HI> the <HI>1&s;t.</HI> time, an Act of Parliament pa&s;&s;ed, to make void a Charter for the &s;ole Trade to <HI>Spain,</HI> and another again&s;t all Monopolies, and though the Pattents for &s;ome Trades with joint-&s;tocks, (whil&s;t the Trades for which they were granted were in their Infancy) have been permitted for the &s;ettling
<PB N="11" REF="7">of a Trade, and till the fir&s;t Adventurers have reaped &s;ome rea&s;onable compen&s;ation for their fir&s;t Under|taking and Adventures, yet afterwards when tho&s;e Trades have encrea&s;ed and become great, the Wi&s;|dom of the Nation has always thought fit, to open a Way for the Kingdom to receive a General Be|nefit thereby.</P>
<P>This as to Pattents in General, and from the Pre|&s;ident in <HI>Ed.</HI> the <HI>3d.</HI> Time, I &s;hall make no Inference, but leave it to the Company them&s;elves, only I &s;hall ob&s;erve, it was never e&s;teemed a Breach of the Pub|lick Faith, and Credit of the Great Seal or a Dero|gation from the Honour of our Kings, to have their Pattents annull'd by Parliament; when the Grants were thought by that Grand Council of the Nation not to be profitable, or to be again&s;t the Common Right of the Subject, whatever the expre&s;s Covenants in tho&s;e Grants were, and no King or Queen by any Grant or Pattent, thought thhem&s;elves bound in Ho|nour or Con&s;cience not to pa&s;s an Act of Parlia|ment to make void &s;uch Pattent, and the rea&s;on is plain; the King being bu&s;ied in the many arduous Affairs of the Kingdom, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to know always what he may legally grant, and is oftentimes deceived in his Grants, and for that rea&s;on they are often annulled by the ordinary cour&s;e of Law, and &s;o might this Companies Pattent have been without any Wrong or Inju&s;tice to the Company, for all Per|&s;ons having a Right by Law to trade to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> unle&s;s excluded by Parliament; the King by his Charter could not grant to the Company any new Right to the Trade, only the Priviledges of an Incorporated Body, but the Parliament ju&s;tly bearing a high Veneration to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, who has
<PB N="12" REF="8">run &s;o great Hazard, and performed &s;o Great and Glorious Atchievements for the Honour and Weal of the Na|tion, have notwith&s;tanding taken care in the late Act pa&s;&s;ed, that nothing &s;hould interfere with his Ma|je&s;ties Pattent, before which Time the Ca&s;e &s;tood thus.</P>
<P>The Company had a Pattent of Incorporation from his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, with Power to trade to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and other Priviledges, without any expre&s;s Clau&s;e to exclude others, or any Covenant (as was in the former Charters from the Crown) that his Maje&s;ty would not grant Licen&s;e to others, to trade thither during the continuance of the &s;aid Charter, but with the expre&s;s Provi&s;o before-mentioned, to have power to make void the &s;aid Charters upon three years notice, if it &s;hall appear to the King, that the &s;aid Charters &s;hall not be profitable to the King or this Realm.</P>
<P>During the continuance of the&s;e la&s;t Charters, therefore even according to the Charters them&s;elves; all other the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> had a Right to Trade to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> as well as the Company, and many u&s;ed that Right and actually traded thither without Interruption, not only as by Law, but even as by tho&s;e Charters they might; and no doubt, but the Per|&s;ons &s;o trading would have been contented, if the Trade might have been continued to be carried on, as it was before this la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament; they &s;ought no Alteration, the Law as it &s;tood was their Protection and Security; and the Charters the Com|pany had, and the Money their Joint-&s;tock was en|abled to &s;catter up and down, was the Companies Security; and the private Traders thought theirs as good as the Companies.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="8">
<P>But though the Company in their Ca&s;e, talk &s;o much of their Dependance on the Security of their Charters, and the Right in Law which they had by them, yet they them&s;elves were convinced that their Right was not well founded, and therefore as they had &s;ought formerly to get an Act of Parliament, with|out which they knew well enough, they had no &s;uch Legal Right as they pretended; &s;o this Se&s;&s;ions they were for making another Attempt, and in Or|der to &s;ucceed they fir&s;t made an Offer to lend 700000 <HI>l.</HI> to the Government, to have the Trade to them&s;elves exclu&s;ive of all others. The other Subjects of <HI>England</HI> being about to be excluded by &s;uch means from the Trade, were &s;oon alarm'd, and that not without Rea&s;on, and begin to think with them&s;elves how to pre&s;erve their Right in the Trade, and their hone&s;t Re&s;ult was, That if the Parliament thought fit to rai&s;e Money by that Trade, they de&s;ired only to fare as the re&s;t of their Fellow Subjects, and they would be ready to lend to the Government as well as the Company, and a much larger Summ.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Hou&s;e of <HI>Commons</HI> thought fit to rai&s;e a Fund of 8 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> for the Payment of the Intere&s;t of Two Millions, and that &s;uch as lent their Money &s;hould be intituled to Trade (for &s;o much as they lent) to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> which was no more than this. In the pre&s;ent Exegency of Affairs, the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> rather than any other Trade, only they judged it rea&s;onable to give all an equal Liberty to come in, whereas the Company would have had it par|tial, and that <HI>they</HI> only, and &s;uch as would have been again drawn in by them, and come in upon their bottom, &s;hould have had the Benefit. This was the true Ca&s;e.</P>

The Company &s;ay, <HI>That after the Bill was brought in,</HI> viz. <HI>the</HI> 10th. <HI>of</HI> June, <HI>They did agree to &s;ubmit their pre&s;ent Stock to a Valuation of</HI> 50 l. <HI>per</HI> Cent. <HI>viz.</HI> 20 l. <HI>per</HI> Cent. <HI>for their dead Stock, and</HI> 30 l. <HI>per</HI> Cent. <HI>for their quick Stock, which they were contented to warrant at the &s;aid Summs, and upon the&s;e Terms they offered to open their Books for new Sub&s;crip|tions, in Order to rai&s;e the two Millions, and afterwards to a&s;certain the Payments of the &s;aid two Millions, they had a General Court on the</HI> 20th. <HI>of</HI> June (<HI>which was when the Bill was well nigh</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Com|mous) <HI>in which they agreed to an immediate Sub&s;crip|tion by private Adventurers,</HI> 20000 l. <HI>to be paid as the fir&s;t Payment &s;ubject to make good the &s;ub&s;equent Payments, which Sub&s;cription was accordingly made.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Propo&s;al as the Company expre&s;t it in their own Ca&s;e, and from whence it is talkt up and down the Town, as if the Company made an Offer of Two Millions, and that it is Hard&s;hip upon them, that they who were in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and offer'd the &s;ame Summs, &s;hould not be accepted rather than others; and the Company in&s;inuate this when they &s;ay, <HI>Pag.</HI> 5. <HI>That formerly it has been the con&s;tant Cu&s;tom in Farms, Bargains and Offers of the like Nature, not to clo&s;e with a new Propo&s;al till the fir&s;t Bidder be asked, whether he is able to advance further, and that notwith|&s;tanding their Charter, and the Right they have to the Trade, they were early told their Propo&s;al &s;hould be op|po&s;ed, though they offered the two Millions in que&s;tion.</HI></P>
<P>I think with Submi&s;&s;ion, if any preference had been &s;hewn by a Parliament, it would have been to tho&s;e who were willing to &s;tand by, and adhere to the Legal Rights of the Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> and not to tho&s;e who &s;trive by undue Means to gain
<PB N="15" REF="9">and &s;upport Grants not founded on Law, however the Parliament have thought fit to make no diffe|rence, and therein the private Traders acquie&s;ce.</P>
<P>But as to the Companies offering to rai&s;e two Mil|lions, when what they and others call an Offer, is taken to pieces and examined it will be found only an Eva&s;ion, and no &s;uch Offer in reality with an In|tention that it &s;hould take effect, only an amu&s;ement to gain time, and &s;o to baffle the Bill. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. They agreed to &s;ubmit their Stock to a Valua|tion of 50 <HI>l.</HI> per <HI>Cent. viz.</HI> their dead &s;tock 20 <HI>l.</HI> per <HI>Cent.</HI> and their quick Stock 30 <HI>l.</HI> per <HI>Cent.</HI> which they were contented to warrant at the &s;aid Summs, and upon the&s;e Terms they offered to open their Books for New Sub&s;criptions, in Order to rai&s;e the two Millions.</P>
<P>They knew very well, that others did not value their Stock at any thing near &s;o much, and that no Body would be gulled a &s;econd time to come into <HI>them,</HI> and not only to take their Stock at 50 <HI>l.</HI> per <HI>Cent.</HI> which was believed not to be worth 20 <HI>l.</HI> but to join with <HI>them,</HI> and become &s;ubject to all their intricate Ac|counts and Incumbrances, and an&s;werable for all their Misdemeanours which the Stock if there be any mu&s;t an&s;wer for, if the Parliament &s;hould think fit to call them to an Account, which po&s;&s;ibly may come to pa&s;s, if the Company continue to provoke them by cen&s;uring and a&s;per&s;ing their Proceedings, becau&s;e it has not &s;uited their extravagant Expectations.</P>
<P>Well, this they were aware of, and therefore to mend the Matter, they were contented to warrant their quick &s;tock at 30 <HI>l.</HI> per <HI>Cent. They were content,</HI> that is, the Com|pany were content that the Stock which mo&s;t People be|lieve is not worth 3 <HI>l.</HI> per <HI>Cent.</HI> &s;hould warrant it &s;elf to be
<PB N="16" REF="10">worth 30 <HI>l.</HI> per <HI>Cent.</HI> and upon whom &s;hould any one have come for making good this Warrant and when? This is plainly to offer nothing at all. But,</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> To a&s;certain the Payment of the two Millions, they &s;ub&s;cribed 200000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;ubject to make good the &s;ub|&s;equent Payments, let us con&s;ider this a little.</P>
<P>Upon the Parliaments Acceptance of this their Propo&s;al, they might rea&s;onably expect in Act to be pa&s;&s;ed in their Favour, and then if no more then the &s;aid 200000 <HI>l.</HI> had been &s;ub&s;cribed, (as for the Rea&s;ons before-mentioned, it is more than probable there would not) what would have been the Con|&s;equence? Why,</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1&s;t.</HI> The Company would have obtained what they have been &s;o long aiming at, an Act of Parliament exclu&s;ive, for the Summ of 200000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2dly.</HI> The King would have been defeated of a much more con&s;iderable Loan, the Company offering Sub&s;criptions for 200000 <HI>l.</HI> and others delivered in Sub&s;criptions for above 1200000 <HI>l.</HI></P>
<P>Now as the Companies Ca&s;e &s;ays, <HI>pag.</HI> 9. <HI>All things are &s;een where every one are concerned to look,</HI> &s;o the Hou&s;e of <HI>Commons</HI> (wherein are &s;o many piercing Eyes, and all concerned to look) &s;oon &s;aw, that this Propo&s;al was in no &s;ort adapted to an&s;wer the End, that is, the Parliaments End, to get the King Two Millions of Money; though it would fully have an&s;wered the Companies End (if it had been complied with) to have got the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade &s;ettled on them ex|clu&s;ive of others for the Summ of 200000 <HI>l.</HI> which would have been to them a very good Bargain, for they knew their Stock would pre&s;ently have advan|ced twice that Summ.</P>
<P>Well now, we are (going along with the Compa|nies
<PB N="17" REF="10">Ca&s;e) at length come to the Bill, <HI>Which</HI> they &s;ay, <HI>pag.</HI> 6. <HI>highly tends to the prejudice of the Compa|nies Charters and Rights thereby granted, and al&s;o to deprive them of their Property which they have in Lands of Inheritance, and other E&s;tates and Intere&s;ts in For|reign Parts to the Value of</HI> 44000 l. <HI>per</HI> Annum, <HI>which Bill likewi&s;e by undeniable con&s;equence deprives them of their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Right in &s;everal Forts and Forti|fications, the Purcha&s;e and Improvement of which, have at &s;everal times co&s;t them above a Million of Pounds Sterling.</HI></P>
<P>If a Per&s;on is Tenant at Will, or has a Lea&s;e for Years of ceretain Ground; and woll build, or other|wi&s;e lay out Money extravagantly upon what he knows he may be turned out of, at the Plea&s;ure of the Lord of whom he holds, or at mo&s;t upon three Years Warning; is there any Inju&s;tice in his Land|lord to make U&s;e of the Power re&s;erved upon the Demi&s;e, or is any one to be blamed but the Tenants own Indi&s;cretion; the Company knew upon what Terms they had their Charters, that all of them in the former Reigns had no Foundation in Law for granting the Trade exclu&s;ive, nay, the mo&s;t of them contained a power of Revocation on three Years No|tice: And therefore in what they &s;ay they have ex|pended, they &s;hould have had a regard to the Terms on which they held tho&s;e Grants. However, their Clamour herein is otherwi&s;e without Ground, for if they have &s;ince their beginning as they &s;ay expended a Million, they have got it over and over by the Trade and divided it out, and the Revenues they pretend to in <HI>India</HI> co&s;ts them much more than the Income.</P>
<PB N="18" REF="11">
<P>I agree with the Companies Ca&s;e, <HI>pag.</HI> 6. That this Actis directly contrary to all their former Char|ters in that point, where the Trade is granted to them exclu&s;ive of all others, and with great Rea&s;on. It is the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and ought always to be the Care of Parliaments, to pre&s;erve the Rights of all the King's Subjects equally; and never was a more equal, rea|&s;onable and ju&s;t Act pa&s;&s;ed, as will appear by and by.</P>
<P>But tho' the Act is contrary to the Charters of former Reigns in that point, it is in nothing contrary to the Charter of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty; as before has been &s;aid.</P>
<P>The Company &s;ay, <HI>pag.</HI> 6. That no Breach or For|feiture of their Charters is charged upon them, if &s;o, it is not becau&s;e by Law it could not be done, for they have done enough to forfeit 100 Charters, and to &s;ubject them to grievous Fines be&s;ides, if Advantages were taken either by the King or Parliament: But without that, the Provi&s;o gives the King a full power to determine them in three Years, <HI>&amp;c fru&s;tra fit per plura quod fieri pote&s;t per pauciora.</HI></P>
<P>The Provi&s;o is as hath been &s;aid to this Effect, that if it &s;hall appear to his Maje&s;ty, that the &s;aid two Charters &s;hall not be profitable to the King or to this Realm, that then upon three Years Notice or Warning, the &s;ame &s;hall cea&s;e and be void.</P>
<P>How could the Re&s;ervation have been more full than this, It is not, if the Trade &s;hall appear unpro|fitable, nay, norif the Company &s;hall appear unpro|fitable, but if the two Charters granted by his Ma|je&s;ty, or any other of the former Charters &s;hall ap|pear to his Maje&s;ty, not to be profitable to him or to the Realm. Then <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<PB N="19" REF="11">
<P>And how can the unprofitablene&s;s of any of the &s;aid Charters appear more plainly and effectually to his Maje&s;ty, then by the Judgment of both Hou&s;es of Parliament.</P>
<P>And now I &s;hall in &s;hort &s;tate the Ca&s;e truly as it is.</P>
<P>Before the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions of Parliament the Company had a Right to Trade to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> and &s;o had all other the King's Subjects, and all went on trading thither as they &s;aw fit, all were alike &s;ubject to the Ha|zard of the War, and all had born their &s;hare of Lo&s;&s;es, and all hoped with the Peace and Time to repair them.</P>
<P>The Company not contented with the Right they &s;ay they had, (though the Law was open and they as well as others, might have had Redre&s;s in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall</HI> for the Inva&s;ion of any Right) They ap|ply to the Parliament to get others excluded from their Right, and the others then apply to pre&s;erve their Right, and the Company being the Aggre&s;&s;ors, think to come off (according to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Proverb and Practice of many) by crying <HI>Whore</HI> fir&s;t; for they have thereby brought a Tax upon the whole Trade, and if any have rea&s;on to complain, it is the private Traders, who before had a Right and could have traded as they plea&s;ed; but now are obliged to trade for no more than they lend the Government.</P>
<P>The Parliament duly weighing this great Affair, came to Re&s;olutions Equal and Honourable at &s;uch a Juncture, obliging all to lend to the Government &s;o much as they de&s;ire to be concerned in the Trade.</P>
<P>In their Ca&s;e <HI>pag.</HI> 9. they find fault, that the Bill allows Forreigners as well as the King's Subjects to &s;ub&s;cribe to the Two Millions, whereby they will be let into the Secrets and My&s;teries of it; which as the
<PB N="20" REF="12">Company are ready to &s;hew, may produce Effects very pernicious and dangerous to the General Intere&s;t of the Nation. Whereas in the Companies An&s;wer to the Regulations propo&s;ed by his Maje&s;ty, dated 20 <HI>May,</HI> 1692. in An&s;wer to the <HI>8th.</HI> Propo&s;ition about Sub&s;cri|bers aking Oath it is his own Money, among&s;t other things they &s;ay, Thirdly, <HI>If &s;uch a Limitation be ad|vi&s;able, certainly &s;ome Nation or other would have hit upon the Expedient before this time, whereas on the con|trary the wi&s;e</HI> Dutch <HI>indulge and favour the very</HI> Jews, <HI>and the more for buying the greater Stock, of whom one Man by Name</HI> Swa&s;&s;o, <HI>had at one time about</HI> 75000 l. <HI>Stock, the</HI> French <HI>King likewi&s;e for the Encouragement of large Sub&s;criptions in that Stock, propounded many con&s;iderable Priviledges and Immunities both to Natives and Forreigners, proportionable to the greatne&s;s of their Sub&s;criptions.</HI></P>
<P>The Company will argue for and agai&s;t the ad|mittance of Forreigners as it &s;erves their turns, and &s;o their Di&s;cour&s;e about the Town is to the &s;ame Effect, one while they &s;ay their Factors will cheat them of all they have there; and another while, that they would &s;end out all that ever they can into their Hands and tru&s;t them further. Upon the whole it is Evident.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Company and all other his Maje&s;ties Subjects, had before this Act an equal Right to the Trade to the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> unle&s;s excluded or re&s;trained by Act of Parliament.</P>
<P N="2">2. That there has no hard&s;hip been put upon the Old of New Sub&s;cribers in the Old Company, nor any Right of theirs invaded, but rather a great Favour is done them, in not puni&s;hing them for their Illegal Practices.</P>
<PB N="21" REF="12">
<P N="3">3. That the old Company made no Propo&s;al to lend the Two Millions, but &s;uch as mu&s;t have proved ineffectual to the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Government, and de&s;tructive of the Rights of the Subject.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the Company heretofore thought it an Advantage to admit Forreigners into the Company, and many are actually now in the pre&s;ent Company, though now in their Ca&s;e they argue again&s;t it.</P>
