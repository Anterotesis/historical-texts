<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_MY la&s;t to you was of the 10th. of <HI>November</HI> pa&s;t, (which, in regard we have had much We&s;terly Winds &s;ince) I hope ere this time you have re|ceived; according to the be&s;t Information I had or could procure, I made bold to acquaint you with &s;undry Pa&s;&s;ages, that before the date there|of, came to pa&s;s among&s;t us: I al&s;o &s;ent you two of our Orders in Print by Order of the Council here; The one for the Confinement of our <HI>Neetop</HI> (i. e. <HI>Friend)</HI> Indians, the other for a general Fa&s;t throughout this Col|lony: By the one you may &s;ee the great Care our Authority hath, as well to make a di&s;tinction vi&s;ible, betwixt our Friends the Chri&s;tian <HI>Indians,</HI> and our Enemies the Heathens, as al&s;o, to &s;ecure the one from injuries, and to lay the other open, and make them liable to the hand of Ju&s;tice: By the other you may &s;ee what &s;ence of the immediate hand of God upon us our Magi&s;trates have; and truly <HI>Sir,</HI> we have great cau&s;e to ble&s;s the Lord for that we have &s;uch Magi&s;trates and Councellers that we are &s;o well a&s;&s;ured do aime at the Glory of God, and the peace and welfare of his people in this Wilderne&s;s; that however the mighty hand of God is lifted up upon us, and he hath given Commi&s;&s;ion to the Sword to de&s;troy, yet we are well &s;a|tisfied there is nothing wanting that lyeth within the reach of their wi&s;dom or &s;trength: Wherefore in the mid&s;t of our troubles we comfort our &s;elves in this, that we are &s;atisfied they do what in them lyeth: I hope in &s;ome &s;hort time I may hear of your receipt thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> In my la&s;t I al&s;o gave you (at fir&s;t) an Account of the Rea&s;ons of the Ri&s;e and Origin of the&s;e unhappy Wars, in which, my Information was not &s;o perfect, but that there was &s;omewhat ami&s;s; although, at that time, the Account thereof was generally receiv'd, and the alteration is not much, only in &s;ome few particular circum&s;tances: Wherefore, that you might be the
<PB N="4" REF="3"> more certain thereof, I &s;hall give you an account wherein I mi&s;&s;ed, Thus: About &s;ix years &s;ince one <HI>So&s;oman,</HI> (an <HI>Indian</HI>-Schollar and Mini&s;ter) having &s;pent &s;ome years in the Study of Divinity, being by that time judged capable of Preaching the Go&s;pel, was by the Authority of <HI>Plymouth</HI> &s;ent to Preach to King <HI>Philip;</HI> he with &s;ome &s;eeming-kind of Devotion, heard him for a while at &s;everal times; and however his Zeal was in outward appearance, yet all that time, and a good while before, he, with &s;everal of his own men, had a Con&s;piracy to cut off the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> thereabouts, and &s;crupled not to make the bu&s;ine&s;s known to <HI>So&s;oman,</HI> as &s;uppo&s;ing he might be of great u&s;e to him, in the car|rying on that bloody de&s;ign; whereupon this <HI>So&s;oman</HI> &s;oon after makes this thing known to the Governor of <HI>New-Plymouth-Collony, Jo&s;iah Win&s;low</HI> E&s;q; King <HI>Philip</HI> &s;u&s;pecting he either would divulge, or had already made known this &s;ecret to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> took Councel to kill this <HI>So&s;oman;</HI> where|fore in order thereunto, one day, as he &s;at fi&s;hing by a River-&s;ide, two or three <HI>Indians</HI> came and barbarou&s;ly Murthered him in the place; where|upon, as &s;oon as the Governor and Councel of <HI>Plymouth</HI> heard thereof, &s;ent and took the &s;aid Murtherers; as al&s;o a &s;mall Party went to King <HI>Philip</HI> and brought him and mo&s;t of his chief men to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and there Examined them, and had &s;everal meetings in Con&s;ultation about the bu&s;ine&s;s; but King <HI>Philip</HI> behaved him&s;elf very uncivilly (like a Heathen,) however due proof could not be produced again&s;t him, and he nor his Men not having yet &s;hed any Engli&s;h Blood after his entring into a League of Peace with the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> was di&s;mi&s;t; only the Murtherers after a legal Condemnation were Hanged. Here lies the occa&s;ion of our pre&s;ent difference, which I have made bold to acquaint you of.</P>
<P><HI>Sir,</HI> Towards the clo&s;e of my la&s;t to you, I gave you an Account of what was done at <HI>Hatfield</HI> the 19th. of <HI>Octob.</HI> la&s;t; in which Fight the Heathens were &s;o put to it, that they were forced to go to their la&s;t refuge, that is, the <HI>Narragan&s;ets,</HI> who I wrote you, word we feared every day more and more would prove perfidious to us; wherefore the Authority of the United Collonies having Intelligence that King <HI>Philip</HI> with his whole retinue, as well Women and Children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> did harbor them&s;elves under the pro|tection of <HI>Ninicroft,</HI> who is the King of the <HI>Narragan&s;ets,</HI> as al&s;o hearing that that &s;ame <HI>Sachem,</HI> that came to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> about the end of <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, (being <HI>Ninicroft</HI>'s Elde&s;t Son) is &s;ince Marryed to the <HI>Squaw Sachem;</HI> which Marriage doth &s;ignifie a near Alliance: and al&s;o &s;eeing that what that <HI>Sa|chem</HI> did agree unto with our Authority, when in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> is not at all regard|ed by them, (for that <HI>Sachem</HI> &s;ent word when he came home into his own Country, that <HI>Ninicroft</HI> would not agree to what he had done:) the&s;e things &s;o falling out near the &s;ame time, put our Authority then in Coun|cel upon &s;ome nece&s;&s;ity of finding out a &s;peedy way to remedy the &s;ame. But notwith&s;tanding their perfideou&s;ne&s;s hitherto, yet about three weeks after, five <HI>Sachems</HI> came together from <HI>Ninicroft</HI> to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and engaged that our Enemies, entertained by them, &s;hould be delivered up in&s;tantly; but nothing being done of what they promi&s;ed, the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the United Collonies, &s;itting in Councel here, (the &s;everal con&s;id erations here expre&s;t, with others moveing them thereto) in the fir&s;t place publi&s;hed this following Remon&s;trance (here in&s;erted <HI>verbatim)</HI> and ordered a Body of Souldiers,
<PB N="5" REF="3" MS="y"> Hor&s;e and Foot to march hence; in order thereunto, on the 10th. of this In&s;tant <HI>December,</HI> &s;ix Companies of Foot and Hor&s;e marched hence un|to <HI>Seaconck:</HI> The number of the Souldiers were thus; Of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> and <HI>Plimouth</HI> Collonies 700. Foot and 200. Hor&s;e, and <HI>Connecticot</HI> Collony having 300. Foot and 100. Hor&s;e ready to meet them at <HI>New London,</HI> whereof Governour <HI>Jo&s;iah. Win&s;low</HI> is gone out General: From <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Collony is gone out in Command, Major <HI>Appleton</HI> of <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> Captain <HI>James Oliver,</HI> Captain <HI>Samuel Mo&s;eley,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Nath. Davenport</HI> of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> Capt. <HI>John&s;on</HI> of <HI>Roxbury,</HI> Capt. <HI>Gardner</HI> of <HI>Salem,</HI> and Capt. <HI>Tho|mas Prentice,</HI> Capt. of the Hor&s;e. The&s;e were Commanders of tho&s;e &s;even Companies that marched hence. The 16th. In&s;tant we had advice from them, that the Enemy had burnt Mr. <HI>Jeremiah Balls</HI> Hou&s;e at <HI>Narragan|&s;ett,</HI> and killed 18. Men, Women, and Children that were in it, and that they had taken 55. <HI>Indians,</HI> and killed 10. more, and burnt 150. Wigwams with the lo&s;s of four of our Men, and as many wounded. This exploit was performed by Capt. <HI>Prentice,</HI> a Capt. of the Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The weather now being extream cold, having, both Fro&s;t and Snow in mo&s;t places two foot, in many places three foot deep, we have as yet had nothing like to a Field Battel with the <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;ave that Fight we had at <HI>Hatfield,</HI> of which I gave you an Account of in my la&s;t, until the&s;e Soul|diers went out la&s;t; &s;ince which time, by &s;everal Po&s;ts coming daily thence, as al&s;o by private Letters, I have this Account of this Fight in particular.</P>
<P>On <HI>Saturday</HI> the 19th. In&s;tant, the General Mu&s;tered up the whole Ar|my in <HI>November,</HI> as before, having with them three Mini&s;ters, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Dudley,</HI> Mr. <HI>Buckley,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Samuel Nowel,</HI> at Capt. <HI>Smiths</HI> Hou&s;e, (the &s;ame Capt. <HI>Smith</HI> I told you in my la&s;t, that came to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> with <HI>Ninnicroft</HI>'s Elde&s;t Son a <HI>Sachem)</HI> who&s;e dwelling is about four miles off the <HI>Narragan&s;etts</HI> dwellings, and is now the &s;tronge&s;t Garri&s;on in tho&s;e parts) and having given orders for a march, according to di&s;cretion, marched to|wards the <HI>Narragan&s;ets</HI> Country (or Town) where finding no <HI>Indians,</HI> they were at a &s;tand, not knowing which way to go in pur&s;uit of the <HI>Indians;</HI> but however during their &s;tay, their Capt. <HI>Prentice,</HI> with his Company di&s;co|vered &s;ome place under ground, wherein was Indian-Corn laid up in &s;tore by them; this encouraged them to look farther; whereupon in their &s;earch they found &s;everal good quantities of that grain in like manner, which after|wards was conveyed to the Garri&s;on. In the Afternoon of that <HI>Saturday,</HI> &s;ome of the Souldiers accidentally e&s;pied an <HI>Indian</HI> alone, whom they took and carried to the General, who upon his refu&s;al to an&s;wer to tho&s;e que&s;tions demanded, was ordered to be Hanged forthwith; whereupon the <HI>Indian</HI> to &s;ave his life, told them where the whole body of the <HI>Indians</HI> were together, as well King <HI>Philip,</HI> and all other Confederate <HI>Sagamores</HI> and <HI>Sachems</HI> with their whole retinue, as al&s;o the whole body of the <HI>Narragan&s;ets,</HI> being joyned all in a body in <HI>November,</HI> about 4500. <HI>Indian</HI> men, be&s;ides Wives and Children: Whereupon, keeping this <HI>Indian</HI> for their Guide, they having provi&s;ions with them, marched all night, the <HI>Indians</HI> being then 16. Miles di&s;tant from them, and that Night there fell a very hard Snow two or three foot deep, and with-all an extream hard Fro&s;t, &s;o that &s;ome of our Men were frozen in their hands and feet, and thereby di&s;abled for Service:
<PB N="6" REF="4" MS="y"> The next day, about Noon, they come to a large Swamp, which by rea|&s;on of the Fro&s;t all the Night before, they were capable of going over (which el&s;e they could not have done) they forthwith in one body entered the &s;aid Swamp, and in the mid&s;t thereof was a piece of firm Land, of about three or four Acres of ground, whereon the <HI>Indians</HI> had built a kind of a Fort, being Pali&s;ado'd round, and within that a clay Wall, as al&s;o felled down a|bundance of Trees to lay quite round the &s;aid Fort, but they had not quite fini&s;hed the &s;aid work: The General placed Capt. <HI>Mo&s;eley</HI> in the Front, to enter the Fort, and the re&s;t of the Companies were placed according to di&s;|cretion: In their march they met with three <HI>Indians</HI> &s;ent out as Scouts, whom they &s;hot dead at &s;ight thereof: as &s;oon as ever the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;aw our Army comeing, they &s;hot as fa&s;t as ever they could, and &s;o our Men did the like. Before our Men could come up to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Fort, the <HI>In|dians</HI> had &s;hot three Bullets through Capt. <HI>Davenport,</HI> whereupon he bled extreamly, and immediatly called for his Lieutenant, Mr. <HI>Edward Ting,</HI> and commited the charge of the Company to him, and de&s;ired him to take care of his Gun, and deliver it according to order, and immediatly died in the place; his Company were extreamly grieved at his death, in regard he was &s;o courteous to them; for he being Commander of that Company, be|longing to <HI>Cambridge</HI> and <HI>Watertown,</HI> &amp;c. was a Stranger to mo&s;t of them; and at the time that he came to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Company, he made a very civil &s;peech to them, and al&s;o gave them free liberty to choo&s;e their Serjeants them&s;elves, which plea&s;ed them very well, and accordingly did &s;o; and it is very probable the <HI>Indians</HI> might think that Capt. <HI>Davenport</HI> was the General, becau&s;e he had a very good Buff Suit on at that time, and therefore might &s;hoot at him.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time our Forces entred the Fort, Captain <HI>Mo&s;eley</HI> being in the Front, the <HI>Indians</HI> knowing him very well, many directed their &s;hot to him, as he afterwards told the General that he believed he &s;aw 50. aim at him: As &s;oon as he and they had entred the Fort, he e&s;pied a heap of above 50. <HI>Indians</HI> lay dead in a corner, which the <HI>Indians</HI> had gathered together; as &s;oon as ever our Men had entred the Fort, the <HI>Indians</HI> fled, our men killed many of them, as al&s;o of their Wives and Children, among&s;t which, an Indian Black-Smith (the only man among&s;t them) that fitted their Guns and Arrow-heads; and among&s;t many more Hou&s;es burnt his, as al&s;o demoli&s;hed his Forge, and carried away his Tools; they fought with the <HI>Indians,</HI> and pur&s;ued them &s;o long as was advantagious to them; then the General gave order to &s;ound a Retreat, which was done according to order. The Retreat was no &s;ooner beaten, and the Souldiers were in a Marching po&s;ture, before they were got all out of the Fort, a thou&s;and fre&s;h <HI>Indians</HI> &s;et on our Men, but in an hours time the <HI>Indians</HI> were forced to Retreat and Flie: Our Men, as near as they can judge, may have killed about 600. Indian Men, be&s;ides Women and Children: Many more <HI>Indians</HI> were killed which we could have no account of, by rea&s;on that they would carry away as many dead <HI>Indians</HI> as they could. Our men be|fore they had been &s;et on by the fre&s;h <HI>Indians,</HI> had &s;et fire to mo&s;t of the Waggons in and about the Fort (which were near 1000. in all,) how ma|ny
<PB N="7" REF="4"> were burnt down they could not tell po&s;itively, only thus; That they Marched above three miles from the Fort by the light of the Fires. Here is an Account of the number of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-men &s;lain by the <HI>Indians</HI> in this Engagement.</P>

<P>It may not be ami&s;s to acquaint you that the Night before the Fight was, and all that day, and the night after, there &s;ell &s;uch an extraordinary Snow that the like hath not been known for many years; and in regard that we had no Po&s;t come from our Army for 4. or 5, days, many fears aro&s;e a|mong&s;t us that our men were lo&s;t either by the Enemy, or the Snow, which made many an heart-ake among&s;t us: But &s;o it was, that which we feared would &s;poil us, did very much di&s;able the Enemy; for we having burnt down almo&s;t all their Wigwams, as al&s;o all their Corn that we could find, they thereby have le&s;s &s;helter and le&s;s &s;ub&s;i&s;tence left them, which mi&s;ery of theirs is much aggravated by that great Snow. The Fight being over, our men Retreated to Mr. <HI>Smith</HI>'s Hou&s;e, where the Noble General gave Order that the Wounded and Sick &s;hould fir&s;t of all be cared for, which was done accordingly; and that they might have the better Accomodation in the Hou&s;e, the General him&s;elf lay in a Barn belonging to the &s;aid Hou&s;e.

<P>King <HI>Philip</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing that <HI>Hatfield,</HI> a Town on <HI>Conecticot</HI>-River, was very thin of men; he drew together 7 or 800. of his <HI>Indians,</HI> among which they had &s;everal Hor&s;es, and &s;uddenly entred the Town on the 19th. of <HI>October,</HI> 1675. which after they had &s;et on Fire in three places, they di|vided them&s;elves into two bodies, and began to act &s;everal Cruelties on the Inhabitants: The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> by their dilligence &s;oon quenched the fires; and making up a body of 200. men, mo&s;t of which were newly come into the Town, they fell on the <HI>Indians</HI> with a great deal of fury, and after two hours Fight, compelled the <HI>Indians</HI> to leave the Town with more ha&s;t than they entred; the Engli&s;h having &s;lain about 100. <HI>Indians,</HI> with very little lo&s;s to them&s;elves, pur&s;ued the re&s;t to the River-&s;ide, where many were drowned that could not &s;wim to the farther &s;ide.

<P>Although you cannot be Ignorant, how &s;tudious this Govern|ment hath been to pre&s;erve Peace in this Colony, and hath taken up and Compromi&s;ed diver&s;e Quarrels that have Ri&s;en between our Selves, our Neighbours, &amp; the <HI>Indians;</HI> And thereby at &s;everal times prevented tho&s;e Calamities wherewith we are now Pre&s;&s;ed: Yet to &s;atisfie you that the &s;ame Mind, and the &s;ame Endeavours are continued in the pre&s;ent Government, we have thought it nece&s;&s;ary to let you under&s;tand the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of our pre&s;ent Troubles, with our endeavours to have prevented the &s;ame.</P>

<P><HI>IN</HI> June <HI>la&s;t, we were Certified by our Friends and Confederates of</HI> Plimouth, <HI>that</HI> Philip <HI>the Sachem of</HI> Mount. Hope <HI>was in Arms, and had &s;olicited all the</HI> Indians <HI>to joyn with him again&s;t the Engli&s;h; and withal, they de&s;ired our A&s;&s;i&s;tance to Suppre&s;s him: which we by the Articles of Confederation could not deny, and therefore applied our &s;elves to Rai&s;e &s;ome Force for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance: but were &s;til de&s;irous to pre|vent a war with the</HI> Indians; <HI>and therefore upon a for|mer Experience of a good Effect wrought upon the &s;aid</HI> Philip, <HI>we re&s;olved to u&s;e the &s;ame means,</HI> viz. <HI>&s;ending Me&s;&s;engers from hence to</HI> Philip <HI>to Treat with him, hoping of the like I&s;&s;ue, which upon the like ca&s;e about four years &s;ince we by Gods good hand obtain|ed. But our Me&s;&s;engers arriving at</HI> Swanzy, <HI>in their way towards Philip, found divers</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Murthered on the Road, and were informed by the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>there, of divers ho&s;tilities of the</HI> Indians, <HI>which rendred our</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="6"> <HI>De&s;ign and their Negotiation hopele&s;s: Vpon which they returned, &amp; informed us as above&s;aid. where|upon our Forces began their march in Aid of our Friends at</HI> Plymouth; <HI>and having driven</HI> Philip <HI>from his Country, we being informed that the</HI> Narragan&s;ets <HI>harboured his women, and aided him with men, we ordered our Souldiers to march to</HI> Narragan&s;et, <HI>in or|der to keep them quiet, and prevent their &s;uccouring or harbouring the Enemy: where, after &s;ome delay, they were drawn to con&s;ent to our demands, promi|&s;ing neither to entertain nor a&s;&s;i&s;t our Enemies which they &s;ince confirmed in a Treaty with the Commi&s;&s;io|ners of the Colonies; Further engaging that they would deliver all tho&s;e of Philips party, that upon his Rout near</HI> Scatoneck, <HI>or &s;ince, were fled to them; but have failed in every particular.</HI></P>
<P><HI>You may al&s;o take notice, That before any of our Souldiers marched to</HI> Mount-Hope, <HI>we were very careful to under&s;tand the &s;tate of the</HI> Nipnet-Indians, <HI>to prevent Philips de&s;ign, &amp; &s;ecure tho&s;e</HI> Indians, <HI>&amp; therefore di&s;patched two Me&s;&s;engers well known to them, to certifie them of Philips motion &amp; of our de&s;ire to keep amity &amp; friend&s;hip with them, according to the Cove|nants made with them long &s;ince, no ways Violated on our part. And by the &s;aid Me&s;&s;engers, received fair returns from the mo&s;t of them, being in 10. or 12. Plan|tations. Some of them pretended fear of us: For their further &s;atisfaction (when our Forces were &s;ent out again&s;t Philip) we to &s;atisfie &amp; &s;ecure them, &s;ent them by</HI> Ephraim Curtice, <HI>a Declaration under the Publick Seal, that we had no de&s;ign or intent to di&s;turb them, or any other</HI> Indians <HI>that would remain in their Plan|tations peaceably: which Me&s;&s;age &amp; Me&s;&s;enger was evilly treated by many of them then A&s;&s;embled, &amp; the Me&s;&s;enger much endangered by the younger men, and not with any &s;atisfaction by their Sachems, as the Event &s;hewed, though at that pre&s;ent more mode|rately received.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY la&s;t to you beared Date the 21&s;t. of <HI>December,</HI> 1675. wherein I gave you a true Account of the &s;tate of our Affairs in <HI>New-England,</HI> particularly of the Engagement of our Forces with the <HI>Indians</HI> on the 19th, of <HI>December,</HI> 1675. and the number of the Slain and Wounded. I &s;hall now continue my Intelligence according to your reque&s;t, and my promi&s;e, and give you a true Account of all tran&s;|actions here (worth your information) &s;ince the fore&s;aid <HI>19th.</HI> of <HI>De|cember.</HI></P>
<P>Our wounded men (thanks be to God) are mo&s;t of them pretty well re|covered, and only Captain <HI>Sealy</HI> is dead that I can hear of. By &s;ome Indian-Pri&s;oners, lately taken, we are certainly informed that they had 355. men killed out-right, be&s;ides &s;everal burnt in their Waggons, with Women and Children, and 180. wounded, many of which are &s;ince dead, particularly <HI>Sachem Quanepins</HI> Brother, who was a man of great Com|mand among the <HI>Indians.</HI> That Night the <HI>Indians</HI> left the place where the Fight was, and Retreated 5. miles farther into the Country. <HI>Ninecroft</HI> an old Sachem in that Country, who hath hitherto continued Neuter, and neither a&s;&s;i&s;ted the <HI>Indians</HI> nor us, &s;ent &s;ome of his men the next day, and Buried the dead <HI>Indians,</HI> and as many of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as were left behind dead.</P>
<P>On the 23. and 24th. of <HI>December,</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;ent &s;ome Commi&s;&s;ioners to our General to Treat of Peace, which they had no mind to conclude; but we &s;oon perceived it was only to prevent our falling upon them, and to gain them&s;elves more time to remove their Army and Provi&s;ion twenty miles farther into the Country, to &s;ome Rocks where we could not get at them without great danger. Although our General knew this, he was de&s;i|rous to keep the Treaty on foot by rea&s;on the Forces of the Collony of
<PB N="14" REF="8" MS="y"> <HI>Connecticot</HI> had left our Army, and we at home to recruit, and tho&s;e &s;up|plies from <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> that are daily expected, not being yet Arrived, our Army was not in a condition to make any new attempts on the Enemy; but had not the <HI>Connecticot</HI> Forces left our Army, we had hopes that we might have compelled the Enemy to yield to our mercy. During this time, our Forces foraged the Country, and brought in great quantities of Indian-Corn to the Army.</P>
<P>About the beginning of <HI>January,</HI> the Forces from <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> that were &s;ent to Reinforce our Army arrived at <HI>Narragan&s;et,</HI> where our Army then lay: the extream coldne&s;s of the Sea&s;on had mightily incommended them in their march; they lo&s;t Eleaven of their Men on their march, that were frozen to death, and brought many others &s;ick and di&s;heartned with the ex|tream coldne&s;s of the Sea&s;on: they were joyfully received by the Army; and &s;oon after them the Connecticot Forces came to the Army, having Re|inforced their Companies with &s;ome fre&s;h men, and brought with them <HI>Unkus</HI> an Old <HI>Sachem,</HI> who dwelt in the <HI>Connecticot</HI> juri&s;diction; he brought with him &s;ome Companies of his own <HI>Indians</HI> to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>The Winter being now broke up, and the Snow and Ice all gone, our Army con&s;i&s;ting in all of 1600. men, began their March to the Rocks, where the <HI>Indians</HI> were fled for protection; but in their way, they had in|telligence that 300. <HI>Indians</HI> had been at <HI>Patuxit,</HI> an Engli&s;h Plantation on the <HI>Narragan&s;et</HI> Bay, where they had burnt Mr. <HI>Carpenters</HI> Corn and Hay, and all his Hou&s;es, except his dwelling Hou&s;e, which likewi&s;e they had &s;et on fire, but it was again quenched by &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> that were in it: They likewi&s;e drove away with them 180. Sheep, 50. head of large Cattle, and 15. Hor&s;es: Be&s;ides, they took much Cattel from young Mr. <HI>Harris,</HI> and killed a Negroe-Servant of his; and having done this mi&s;chief, returned home with their Booty.</P>
<P>Our Army being Arrived in <HI>Pumham</HI>'s Countlry, an <HI>Indian Sachem,</HI> we burnt his Town, and had a &s;mall Reincounter with &s;ome of his <HI>Indians,</HI> where we wounded his chief Captain <HI>Quaqua&s;h</HI> on the knee, and killed five of his Men, and had four of our <HI>Connecticot</HI> men wounded.</P>
<P>Our Scouts brought in Pri&s;oner one <HI>Tift,</HI> a Renegadoe Engli&s;h man, who having received a de&s;erved puni&s;hment from our General, de&s;erted our Army, and fled to the Enemy, where he had good entertainment, and was again &s;ent out by them with &s;ome of their Forces; he was &s;hot in the Knee by our Scouts, and then taken before he could di&s;charge his Musket, which was taken from him and found deep charged, and laden with Slugs: He was brought to our Army, and Tryed by a Coun&s;el of War, where he pretended that he was taken Pri&s;oner by the <HI>Indians,</HI> and by them com|pelled to bear Arms in their Service; but this being proved to be fal&s;e, he was Condemned to be Hanged and Quartered, which was accordingly done.</P>
<P>Our Army beat the <HI>Indians</HI> from the fore&s;aid Rocks, and pur&s;ued them almo&s;t as far as <HI>Quabog,</HI> in which pur&s;uit we killed about 60. or 70. of them, and found many of the Matts &s;cattered in the way, with which they cover their Hou&s;es, which we &s;uppo&s;e they could not carry with them by rea|&s;on
<PB N="15" REF="8"> of our clo&s;e pur&s;uit. Some Pri&s;oners taken from them, inform us, that their body con&s;i&s;ts of 4000. whereof 1800. were Fighting Men, half of which wanted Arms, that they were in great want of Powder, and greater want of Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Provi&s;ion growing &s;carce in our Army, and the Enemy having clean&s;ed the Country of things that might tend to our Relief, our General re&s;olved to pur&s;ue them no farther, but to ha&s;ten homewards, which accordingly was done with what &s;peed we could; but the &s;carcity of Victuals daily en|crea&s;ing, we were forced to kill &s;everal of our Hor&s;es for our Su&s;tenance. Our General di&s;mi&s;t the <HI>Connecticot</HI>-Men, and &s;ent them home the neare&s;t way, and Old <HI>Unkus</HI> and his <HI>Indians</HI> along with them. They proved very faithful in our Service, and were well treated by us. Our General having left 60. men in Garri&s;on at Mr. <HI>Smiths</HI> Hou&s;e, at <HI>Narragan&s;et,</HI> where the Fight was on the 19th. of <HI>December,</HI> came home by the way of <HI>Malborough:</HI> Many of our Souldiers are troubled with the <HI>Flux,</HI> of which our General is one.</P>
<P>King <HI>Philip</HI> hath not yet been at <HI>Narragan&s;et,</HI> as we feared; but is retired with his Men near <HI>Albany,</HI> where he hath kept his Winter Quarters. We very much fear the <HI>Indians</HI> falling on our Out-Towns this Spring, which if they &s;hould, would extreamly damnifie us.</P>
<P>Our Friend Mr. <HI>H. O.</HI> went out again into the Army, before he was cured of his old wound, and hath received another on his Elbow-joynt, which we fear will cau&s;e him to lo&s;e his Arm, if not his Life. Our Enemies are yet very Unmerciful, &s;paring no per&s;ons life that they can Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>I &s;ee no likelihood of any Peace, but much fear our Wars are far from an end: Our Trade to <HI>Virginia</HI> is quite decayed, not one Ve&s;&s;el having gone from hence thither &s;ince the Wars began; but by a &s;mall Ve&s;&s;el Arrived here from thence, we are informed that the <HI>Indians</HI> have fallen unexpected on the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and de&s;troyed many of them, and done much harm with very little lo&s;s to them&s;elves, but this report finds very little credit with us; by the next Shiping I &s;hall (God willing) give you a farther Account of our Affairs, and in the mean time &s;hall neglect no opportunity of informing my &s;elf of the tran&s;actions of the&s;e Parts, being &s;en&s;ible how much you have obliged</P>

<P>MY la&s;t to you was an information of a bloody Tragedy intended a|gain&s;t his Maje&s;ties Subjects here in this I&s;land, by the Heathen the Negroes, which was by the Providence of God miraculou&s;ly di&s;covered eight days before the intended Murder &s;hould have been acted: The manner of the di&s;covery was thus; A Negroe man be|longing to Mr. <HI>Hall</HI> Senior, being ab&s;ented from his &s;aid Ma&s;ter, among &s;e|veral other Negroes who had a hand in the Plot: In a Councel among them, they did contrive that the Negroes belonging to each &s;everal Planta|tion, &s;hould in the dead time of the Night fall on at the &s;ound of the Allarm, which was to be given in one hour, and at &s;everal places through the I&s;land, which Negroes &s;o allotted was to kill their Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es with their Over&s;eers; this fore&s;aid Negroe of Mr. <HI>Halls</HI> (though one of the chief Plotters) yet having a re&s;pect to his Ma&s;ter, would by no means con&s;ent to the killing of his Ma&s;ter, and upon refu&s;al was much threatned; and being afraid of his Life, makes his e&s;cape and returns home; and one day, which was a little before the pro&s;ecution of the murder, was over-heard (telling the Plot to his Country-men) by a Negro Woman, who waited and attend|ed on her Mi&s;tre&s;s, which the Negro Woman immediately reveals. The Negroe man being taken to examination, confe&s;t the whole truth, which was immediately told the Governour, who appointed &s;ome Captains to rai&s;e their Companies for depre&s;&s;ing the Rebels, which accordingly was done, and abundance taken &amp; apprehended, &amp; &s;ince put to death, and the re&s;t kept in a more &s;tricter manner; yet <HI>Jethuran</HI> like, we have kicked a|gain&s;t God, and &s;lighted the mercy of &s;o great a deliverance. The man|ner of their proceedings I wrote to your more at large; and as the Lord did deliver us from the Tyranny and barbarous cruelty of Savage Heathens, and we &s;till remaining ob&s;tinate, &amp; refu&s;ing to return to him by Repentance; the Lord hath taken us into his own hand to cha&s;ti&s;e us, which cha&s;tilements lyeth very heavy on the poorer &s;ort, and none of the Rich excepted. Sir, upon the la&s;t day of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> la&s;t, about &s;ix of the Clock in the Afternoon, there did ari&s;e a Violent Storm of Wind &amp; Rain out of the North We&s;t, and continuing between the North and the South &s;o violent, that before the hour of Twelve at Night, there was not twenty Hou&s;es &s;tanding in our Pa|ri&s;h, in which there is above three hundred Families, and tho&s;e that did &s;tand, much damnified; our Neighbouring Pari&s;hes ta&s;ting of the &s;ame Cup. There is kill'd out-right (by the falling of Hou&s;es) in this Pari&s;h, thirty &s;even, and many more is &s;ince, with the violence of the wind and cold, dead, and many lying in their beds of &s;ickne&s;s; and as to our Ships,
<PB N="20" REF="11"> all drove A&s;hore to pieces, except one of the Kings Men of War, which went to Sea, and returning next day after the Storm was cea&s;ed, did pro|te&s;t to the Governour, that twenty Leagues off there was no Storm, for he carried his Top &s;ail half Ma&s;&s; high. Our fellow-&s;ubjects in <HI>New-England,</HI> have the 28th. of the &s;ame month ta&s;ted of the &s;ame Cup, and was very hard put to it this la&s;t Summer by one King <HI>Philip</HI> an <HI>Indian</HI> King, who hath Re|volted without cau&s;e given him by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> neither will he &s;hew any rea&s;on why; but being by an Emba&s;&s;ador from the Governour of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> demanded why he would maintain the War, refu&s;ed to Treat with the Em|ba&s;&s;ador, telling him, <HI>The Governour was but a Subject, and that he would not Treat except his Brother King</HI> Charles <HI>of</HI> England <HI>were there:</HI> There is abundance of Families de&s;troyed, be&s;ides tho&s;e kill'd in the War; but it is very much hoped this Winter they will be Routed; the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e they have no Woods nor Bu&s;hes to &s;helter in, which is a great help to a Flying-Army, &s;uch as they are, for they will not bide any pitch Battel. Our Bre|thren in <HI>Virginia</HI> had been hard put to it this la&s;t Summer, if it had not been for the Relief of <HI>New-England</HI> and <HI>New York,</HI> which makes it the harder with us here: pray God mend it.</P>
<P>By the tempe&s;tuous Wind, and the violent raging of the Sea, which hath much over-flowed our banks, and incroacht upon the Land, here are many Hou&s;es lo&s;t; among which mine was in number, where I &s;aved no|thing to cover us from the violence of the Storm but what was on our backs. Pray God that I may make a &s;anctified u&s;e of the Cha&s;ti&s;ement, becau&s;e the Lord hath not given over our Life to Death. So having no more at pre&s;ent, but my Service to your &s;elf and good Lady, I re&s;t</P>
