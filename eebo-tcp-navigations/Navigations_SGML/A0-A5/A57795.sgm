<HEAD>THE Royal Progre&s;s, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Royal Progre&s;s being re|&s;olv'd on, and Preparations made accordingly, and the Gaurds &s;ent away before to lie on the Road, the King left <HI>Ken&s;ington</HI> on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the Seventeenth of <HI>October,</HI> 1695. and arriv'd at <HI>Newmarket</HI> the &s;ame Eve|ning; where the Eighteenth at Night happen'd a <HI>Fire,</HI> which began in a Sta|ble, but was &s;oon extingui&s;h'd, and the Damage it did was very incon&s;iderable.
<PB N="4" REF="3">Several Gentlemen of the&s;e Parts came to wait on his Maje&s;ty, and to welcome him Home and to this Place, and then took occa&s;ion to Congratulate his Maje|&s;ty on his taking the City and &s;trong Ca|&s;tle of <HI>Namur:</HI> The next Day was &s;pent in Hunting, with which his Maje&s;ty was extreamly diverted. On <HI>Sunday,</HI> being the Twentieth, the principal Members of the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Cambridge</HI> attended his Ma|je&s;ty here, <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Newmarket,</HI> and the Vice-Chancellor made a &s;hort Congratulatory Speech upon his Maje&s;ty's happy Succe&s;s Abroad, and his &s;afe Return: And his Ma|je&s;ty, in an&s;wer to it, was graciou&s;ly pleas'd to give them great A&s;&s;urances of his Royal Favour and Protection; after which they all had the honour to ki&s;s his Maje&s;ty's Hand.</P>
<P>The next Moning, being the Twen|ty fir&s;t, the King parted from hence, and arrived the &s;ame Evening at <HI>Althrop,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="3">in <HI>Northampton&s;hire,</HI> being attended by di|vers of the Nobility, and the principal Per|&s;ons of the Country. This is a noble Seat belonging to the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> an ancient Family, the <HI>Spencers</HI> having long po&s;&s;e&s;t it; here his Maje&s;ty &s;taid a whole Week: The concour&s;e of Nobility, and Gen|try, and chief Inhabitants of <HI>Northampton</HI> (which is near this Place) is very great. The King took the Diver&s;ion of the Rural Sports two or three of the fir&s;t Days, and on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 24th. his Maje&s;ty din'd with the Earl of <HI>Northampton</HI> at <HI>Ca&s;tle-A&s;hby,</HI> a very fine Hou&s;e in the &s;ame County; and the next, being the 25th. the King did the Earl of <HI>Montague</HI> the Honour to dine with him at <HI>Boughton,</HI> a &s;tately and magnificent Pile of Building: Here his Maje&s;ty was &s;plendidly Entertain'd, and was attended with a great Number of the Nobility and Gentry of this County, whom his Maje&s;ty receiv'd very kindly, and told them, <HI>Their County was, in his Opinion, the fine&s;t in</HI> Eng|land,
<PB N="6" REF="4"><HI>and, perhaps, in the whole World; that nothing made a Gentleman look like a Gen|tleman, but living like one.</HI> His Maje&s;ty thank'd them for their good Company; and, indeed, he had a great deal, for there was hardly any Body of Note that did not come upon this Occa&s;ion; and as my Lord <HI>Montague</HI> was &s;hewing his Maje&s;ty his Hou&s;e, Painting, Carving, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the King told my Lord, <HI>'Twas not good for One to &s;et One's Heart on any of them, for neither He nor his Lord&s;hip &s;hould be there Forty Years hence to &s;ee them.</HI></P>
<P>The 28th. his Maje&s;ty left <HI>Althorp,</HI> and came in the Evening to <HI>Stamford;</HI> but went (tho' out of his way) to &s;ee <HI>Burghly</HI> Hou&s;e, the Seat and con&s;tant Re&s;idence of the Earl of <HI>Exeter,</HI> who was come away to <HI>London;</HI> which his Maje&s;ty being inform'd of, was pleas'd to ask, if he had carried his Hou&s;e with him? an&s;wer was made no; <HI>Then,</HI> &s;ays the King, <HI>I'll go and &s;ee it;</HI> which
<PB N="7" REF="4">his Maje&s;ty did twice, that night and the next morning, being extreamly &s;atisfied with it: 'Tis a noble Pile of Stone Build|ing, built indeed about a hundred Years &s;ince by <HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Burghley,</HI> but mighti|ly adorn'd and beautified by the pre&s;ent Earl of <HI>Exeter,</HI> who lives very Great and Nobly when there, like him&s;elf, and like an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Noble-Man; for loftine&s;s of Rooms, great variety of Pictures, and fine Painting and Carving, done by the grea|te&s;t Ma&s;ters of <HI>Italy,</HI> brought thence by his Lord&s;hip, maintain'd and liberally re|warded, for Terra&s;&s;es, Conduits, Fi&s;h-Ponds, Fountains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It may vie with, nay, is thought the be&s;t in <HI>England.</HI> The Painting and Carving are &s;o curious, that &s;ome very great Travellers, and Men of exqui&s;ite Judgment, have affirm'd they have met with nothing either in <HI>Italy</HI> or in <HI>France</HI> that exceeds them. The Park is improv'd, by planting a multitude of Walks of A&s;h, Elm, Che&s;nut, and &s;everal
<PB N="8" REF="5">other &s;orts of Trees. Through this Park pa&s;&s;eth the old <HI>Roman</HI> Way, mention'd by many Authors, and &s;o on to <HI>Walcote,</HI> above <HI>Berneck.</HI> At <HI>Wothorpe,</HI> a little di&s;tance from this the Earl of <HI>Exeter</HI> has another hand|&s;ome Seat, with a little Park wall'd about: It was built by <HI>Thomas Cecil,</HI> Earl of <HI>Exe|ter,</HI> and tho' not very &s;mall (for it was large enough to hold the late Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> and his Family for &s;ome Years) yet &s;o mean did it &s;eem, in compari&s;on with the former, that its Pounder plea|&s;antly &s;aid, He <HI>built it only to retire to out of the Du&s;t, while his great Hou&s;e of</HI> Burgh|ley <HI>was a &s;weeping.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Stamford</HI> the Mayor and Aldermen, attended with their two Burge&s;&s;es, waited on the King, and had the honour to ki&s;s his Maje&s;ty's Hand, and of welcoming him into tho&s;e Parts, with all po&s;&s;ible Demon&s;trations of Joy, by ringing of Bells, making of Bonfires, and &s;etting up
<PB N="9" REF="5" MS="y">of Illuminations throughout the whole Town.</P>
<P>The 29th. the King din'd at Sir <HI>John Brownlow</HI>'s at <HI>Bilton</HI> near <HI>Grantham,</HI> and came that Night to <HI>Lincoln,</HI> being at|tended by a mighty concour&s;e of Peo|ple.</P>
<P>The 30th. in the Morning his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> left this Town, and went to <HI>Welbeck,</HI> ha|ving been met by the Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> Seven Miles off, at <HI>Dunham-Ferry,</HI> the En|trance into this County. The 31&s;t. being the la&s;t Day of <HI>October,</HI> the King dined with his Grace the Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> at <HI>Welbeck,</HI> after having receiv'd the Diver|&s;ion of Hunting in the Forre&s;t of <HI>Shire|wood,</HI> where are an infinite Number of Deer, and Branchy-headed Stags; his <HI>Ma|je&s;ty</HI> gave order for the filling up the Saw-Pits there, which are dangerous to Hunt&s;men. <HI>Welbeck-Abbey</HI> lies on the
<PB N="10" REF="6" MS="y">North-We&s;t &s;ide of this County of <HI>Not|tingham,</HI> about a Mile and a half from <HI>Worken&s;op,</HI> a Town famous for the abun|dance of Liquorice planted and cultiva|ted there. <HI>Welbeck</HI> Abbey is a very noble Building, &s;eated in the lowe&s;t part of a fine Park, &s;urrounded with Trees of ex|cellent Timber, and was the Seat of <HI>Wil|liam</HI> and <HI>Henry,</HI> late (and al&s;o is of the pre&s;ent) Duke of <HI>Newca&s;tle.</HI></P>

In
<PB N="11" REF="6">the Evening the Lord-Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> with his Clergy, attended his <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> and congratulated his happy Succe&s;s and &s;afe Return, expre&s;s'd their Gratitude for his <HI>Maje&s;ty's Care of the Church,</HI> who had &s;how'd him&s;elf truly the Defender of the Faith; gave his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> great A&s;&s;urance of their Zeal, and Loyalty to his Intere&s;ts, and Government; pray'd for all Ble&s;&s;ings to attend his Royal Per&s;on, and recom|mended Them&s;elves to his Royal Prote|ction; which his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> was pleas'd to a&s;&s;ure them of, as al&s;o of his good Grace, and Favour.</P>
<P>The Corporations of <HI>Newark</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t-Retford</HI> attended the King, and ki&s;&s;ed his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI>'s Hand: The Recorder of each Place congratulated his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI>'s glorious Succe&s;s at <HI>Namur,</HI> and &s;afe Return to <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and gave the King a mo&s;t hearty Wel|come in the&s;e Parts; all which his <HI>Maje&s;ty</HI> took very kindly from them.</P>
