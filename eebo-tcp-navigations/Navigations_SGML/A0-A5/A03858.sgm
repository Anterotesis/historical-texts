<OPENER><SALUTE>THRISE ILLVSTRI|ous, reuerend, generous, magnificent and noble Lordes, our approoued good friendes and woorthily re&s;pected neighbours, with our heartie&s;t &s;alutation we heere offer you all our &s;eruice.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_ALl the worlde knoweth that the&s;e broyles of warre &amp; com|motions in gouernment haue not without iu&s;t occa&s;ion been &s;tirred vp, and that our enter|pri&s;e in betaking vs to our armes, neither did nor doth ayme at the offence of any man: but was onely in|tended for the &s;tanding vpon our owne garde, and the repelling of &s;o many and &s;o grieuous iniuries which heeretofore we haue beene &s;ubiect vnto. Neuertheles fearing lea&s;t our &s;ilence might be a preiudice vnto vs and brande vs with &s;ome blame becau&s;e of the weale-publike of Chri&s;tendome, we thought it conuenient, to acquaint you in fewe
<PB REF="3">termes with the fir&s;t motiues of the&s;e tumults, that (occa&s;ion offring it &s;elfe) you might the rather ex|cu&s;e &amp; iu&s;tifie our proceedings both to your neigh|bour Chri&s;tian Princes, as al&s;o to all others of the fore&s;aid Chri&s;tian common-weale.</P>
<P>You &s;hall vnder&s;tand then that his &s;acred Im|periall and royall Maie&s;tie hauing infringed the oth wherin he was bound and obliged vnto this realme, hauing violated and di&s;anuld all the rights, immuni|ties, liberties &amp; priuiledges which for &s;o many e&s;pe|ciall merits &amp; rare vertues had of a long time beene conferd vpon our predece&s;&s;ours by the holy kings of Hungary: hath notwith&s;tanding without either regard of our bodies, our goods, or re&s;pect of iu|&s;tice, nobilitie or religion, as it were abandoned and pro&s;tituted vs to the mercile&s;&s;e mercy of his men of warre, our bodies for the exerci&s;ing of their cruel|ties, and our &s;poiles for the enriching of their bags: him&s;elfe lending a deafe eare to our &s;o pitifull and &s;o many &s;upplications formed and pre&s;ented vnto him within the&s;e 20 yeeres at his Diets and general a&s;&s;emblies in Po&s;&s;onia: as al&s;o he lightly pa&s;&s;ed ouer tho&s;e relations and remon&s;trances offred vnto him by Amba&s;&s;adours &s;ent vp by the E&s;tates of the realme for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. True it is that cer|taine yeeres pa&s;t his fore&s;aide Maie&s;tie &s;ent to our &s;uccour one <HI>George Basta</HI> accompanied with an ar|mie of &s;undrie nations, and among&s;t them no fewe Wallons: but he was &s;o farre from employing his force in our defence, that he graunted his &s;ouldiours ab&s;olute commi&s;&s;ion to put land and countrie to fire
<PB REF="3">and &s;word; as al&s;o to raun&s;acke, beate downe and leuell with the grounde the new-pilled and lately robbed hou&s;es of the Noblemen. And although he had &s;ufficiently prouided for the mo&s;t of his garde and &s;uch as were nighe&s;t about him, yet was there no con&s;ideration nor re&s;pect had at all: for the Wallons for all this cea&s;ed not to &s;urpri&s;e, &s;acke and ruinate whole Townes, Villages, Burrowes and No|blemens ca&s;tles, whom they ma&s;&s;acred with|out re&s;pect, as they did al&s;o the Mini&s;ters of the worde of God, fleaing &s;ome of them as yet aliue. They likewi&s;e &s;econded their crueltie with all filthines and infamous bea&s;tline&s;&s;e, raping and forcing women euen to death: and without all manner of regard of either youth or age, they &s;pared neither yongue gyrles nor (which is more) women nowe ready to bee brought to bedde, nay nor tho&s;e which now they found in trauaile, who~ they forced &amp; ra|ui&s;ht with a farre more than bea&s;tly crueltie. Moreouer again&s;t all right and iu&s;tice yawning and gaping for our goods and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, he tooke coun&s;aile of his familiars and be&s;t-tru&s;ted friends, of many &s;leights and tricks of legerde|maine, whereby he might either &s;natch and extort, or at lea&s;twi&s;e confi&s;cate what&s;oeuer we had. All which inuentions and mi&s;chieuous practi&s;es he wrought by the meanes of his Ger|man captaines, who&s;e &s;eruice he likewi&s;e v&s;ed
<PB REF="4">in the tormenting of our per&s;ons, and e&s;peci|ally of theirs of the Nobilitie, who poore &s;oules tooke no re&s;t: for he ca&s;ting them into pri&s;on for all the torments they endured was neuer v|&s;ed to relea&s;e them, before &s;uch times as they bought their liberties full dearely. And his cu&s;tome was by the &s;ame meanes for the re|lea&s;ing of their impri&s;onment to take of them a great and &s;olemne oath that they would neuer bethinke them of that exce&s;&s;iue wrong they had endured, nor euer by iu&s;tice, lawes or any other way goe about to recouer &s;ome &s;atisfa|ction, as likewi&s;e they &s;hould neuer meddle with the recouering of &s;uch heritages and re|uenews which had been taken from them and be&s;towed vpon &s;trangers. And which is more, his imperiall Maie&s;ty for the &s;pace of thirteen yeares, during which our warres la&s;ted, neuer deigned as much as once to honour our Realme with his pre&s;ence: that after &s;o many mi&s;chiefes he might be&s;tow as it were a brea|thing &s;pace vpon &s;o many of his faithfull and poore di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ubiects: who in all their gene|rall Parliaments, renewed euery yeare and very chargeable vnto them, had put vp vnto his Maie&s;tie &s;o many and &s;o earne&s;t petitions and &s;upplications: in&s;omuch as many priuate men vpon their owne co&s;ts were faine to make a voyage vnto Pragues and there to ca&s;t them|&s;elues into his Maie&s;ties armes, be&s;eeching his
<PB REF="4">mercy and crauing iu&s;tice: but their cries were little regarded, onely they were &s;ent to certaine Coun&s;ellours, who after a formall kind of iu|&s;tice di&s;patched them in the maner of an<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">D'uneac|quit.</NOTE> ac|quiting: &s;o as the mo&s;t part was faine to returne without ought doing, with &s;trange outcries and complaints for want of iu&s;tice. His Ma|ie&s;ty him&s;elfe altogether as oft as plea&s;ed him, directly again&s;t the cu&s;tomes and &s;tatutes of the Realme, cau&s;ed his iudgements to be done and put in execution out of the limits of the fore&s;aid Realme: to whom who &s;o re&s;i&s;ted (howbeit &s;uch powers had been referred to common a&s;|&s;emblies or parliaments) was pre&s;ently puni|&s;hed. Witne&s;&s;es be the mo&s;t honorable Lords, <HI>Steeuen Illyeszarye,</HI> now bani&s;hed and bereaft of all his reuenews vpon this occa&s;ion: and <HI>Iohn Leo,</HI> a mo&s;t honourable man and a great Iu&s;ticier, with their Coun&s;ellours, <HI>Diazy, Bam|fy, Sigi&s;munde, Sarma&s;agly, Ladi&s;tas, Gyolafy, Iohn Imrify, George</HI> and <HI>Valentine Homelay,</HI> as al&s;o the famous <HI>George Sabo,</HI> who, how they haue beene dealt withall, all men know. And making no account or e&s;teeme of a naturall Hungarian, he inue&s;ted &s;trangers with all the offices and e&s;tates of the Realme: which is no|thing el&s;e but to aba&s;tardi&s;e and violate the law and libertie of the Realme, a thing mo&s;t vio|lent and neuer put in practi&s;e in any countrey.
<PB REF="5" MS="y">La&s;tly, to be briefe, our wiues, our children, our brethren, our &s;i&s;ters, our parents and allies and what el&s;e we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, lay at their com|maund, and they di&s;po&s;ed of it according to their good will and plea&s;ure. Nowe with what hart-pearcing griefe we endured all the&s;e cro&s;&s;es, we referre to the iudgement of tho&s;e who &s;tripped of all affections be plaine louers of publique hone&s;ty and zealous of the law of God. Yet haue we endured all the&s;e thinges with &s;uch and &s;o great patience as al our neigh|bour Realmes held vs in admiration: and for all this neuer enterpri&s;ed any thing till we per|ceiued how they of the Clergie again&s;t all right and rea&s;on and the ordinances of the Realme, not content with their owne limits, wrigold them&s;elues vnto e&s;tates and offices, to the great di&s;paragement of the laity, and &s;natching the authority of Iu&s;tice, withdrew to them&s;elues all honors and dignities: wherewith not &s;ati&s;|fied they further pried how to depriue vs of our liberty, and which is wor&s;e, haue aduentured to tempt our Religion, employing for that purpo&s;e diuers per&s;ons to qua&s;h and quench in vs our Orthodoxall and true confe&s;&s;ion of faith. Now the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall liuings which anciently were by his Maie&s;ties Father and Grand-father, as al&s;o by the Generals of their armies and principall Chiefetaynes of warre,
<PB REF="5">be&s;towed for the reliefe of our publique nece&s;&s;i|ties and the maintaining and managing of a continuall warre, and thereupon became im|pledgde and morgagde to our predece&s;&s;ours: are nowe become the pray and the bootie of Church-men. Who, by vnlawfull meanes, v&s;urpe and &s;natch them from the true owners and with their proceedings in Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall courts, being both Iudges and parties, doe in|finitely mole&s;t both the Nobility and the com|mon people al&s;o, blind-fowlding and enuelop|ing them with the puni&s;hment of excommuni|cation; the onelie meanes of ab&s;olution from the which, is to re&s;ort fraught with fatte and honourable pre&s;ents, which in the end bring|eth them to a mo&s;t mi&s;erable pouertie.</P>
<P>Moreouer in this la&s;t Diet, they of the realm hauing pre&s;ented certain articles to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Sai &s;erenite, meaning the Archduke.</NOTE> his High|ne&s;&s;e (who was there pre&s;ent with all the po|wer and pui&s;&s;ance of his Maie&s;ty as repre&s;en|ting his per&s;on) and his Highne&s;&s;e accepting of them, they of the Church notwith&s;tanding in a manife&s;t di&s;daine both of his Highne&s;&s;e and the re&s;t of the Princes, adding, paring, changing and blotting out many points con|tained in that bil of reque&s;t, did maime and cor|rupt it altogether.</P>
<P>Furthermore the Wallons &s;et on by &s;ome of the Bi&s;hops and &s;uffring them&s;elues to be ca|ried
<PB REF="6">away with their owne pa&s;&s;ions, hauing, in a manner neuer heard of before, tormented the Mini&s;ters of the word of God, in the end ma&s;&s;acred them mo&s;t bloudily: and pa&s;&s;ing further, fle&s;hing them&s;elues vpon their dead and now interred carca&s;&s;es: vnburied and burnt them &s;tarke-naked. And among&s;t many moe, they &s;pared not the dead bodies of the noble and illu&s;trious Lord <HI>George,</HI> Earle of Bathor, his wife and his parents: and it is incredible how inhumanely they v&s;ed the dead body of that honorable Counte <HI>Stephen Bathor.</HI> The armes of the Earle <HI>George Bathor</HI> found with|in his tombe are at this in&s;tant in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the aboue named <HI>George Ba&s;ta,</HI> and borne by him. In the ende &s;etting forward to pull downe the temple of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ouia,</HI> to bani&s;h and cha&s;e out all the Mini&s;ters and profe&s;&s;ours of true religion to &s;eaze violently vpon all the goods of the &s;aid towne, and all this again&s;t the adui&s;e of <HI>Iohn Iacob Barbian,</HI> Earle of Belioy|en&s;e &amp; Gouernour of high Hungary: as al&s;o of <HI>Francis Torgat,</HI> Chancellour and Bi&s;hop of Ni|ter. When we &s;aw the&s;e &s;tratagems: we, in the name of all the Realme, mette together at the generall a&s;&s;embly holden at Po&s;&s;onia, and there wrought all our endeuours by praiers and &s;upplications vnto his Highne&s;&s;e, that hee would hinder that re&s;olution and ward of that
<PB REF="6">blow, humbly be&s;eeching his Serenitie that for the con&s;eruation of peace, the&s;e affaires of Re|ligion might be pa&s;&s;ed ouer and deferd vntill &s;ome other time: but for all that we did our vt|mo&s;t deuoir, yet could we obtaine nothing at all, and thereupon at the very &s;ame in&s;tance we made our complaints with prote&s;tations in the pre&s;ence of his fore&s;aide<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Serenit&eacute;.</NOTE> Highne&s;&s;e and the E&s;tates of the Realme. But in &s;teed of a good and curteous an&s;weare which we promi&s;ed our &s;elues, his Maie&s;tie quite contrary of his owne proper di&s;po&s;ition neuer acquainting the E|&s;tates withall: and in meere mi&s;pri&s;ion of their authority (a thing neuer heeretofore practi&s;ed by any King of Hungary) dared boldly of his ab&s;olute power to in&s;ert a mo&s;t pernicious and horrible Article among the re&s;t which mena|ced and threatned no le&s;&s;e vnto vs, than the vt|ter lo&s;&s;e and confu&s;ion of our &s;ub&s;tance, our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, our liues, yea and our very &s;oules, with the quite aboli&s;hing and rooting out of all the Hungarian nation. And by this time for an earne&s;t pennie and a &s;ure te&s;timony of his good will, he had already by his mo&s;t rigorous briefes, proceeded in the bani&s;hing of the Archbi&s;hop of Coloaren&s;e, that by this means hee might with the greater facility make him|&s;elfe ma&s;ter of the Temple, the Pari&s;h and the Vniuer&s;ity of Lutchenien. Now to delay and
<PB REF="7">allay the current of &s;o many mi&s;chiefes, &s;etting before our eies all &s;uch things as had pa&s;&s;ed as al&s;o tho&s;e flames which more began to worke our vtter ruine and confu&s;ion: by authority of our common a&s;&s;embly called for this purpo&s;e in the towne of Galred in the pre&s;ence of the fore&s;aid Earle of Belioyen&s;e and of them of the chamber of Sepu&s;e, and he him&s;elfe of whom we &s;pak a&s;&s;i&s;ting: we &s;olemnely &s;wore to per&s;i&s;t con&s;tantly in that prote&s;tation which we had &s;o authentically made in the Diet of Po&s;&s;onia: and that we would maintaine and defend our &s;elues by tho&s;e decrees of <HI>Andrew,</HI> the &s;econd, called King of Ieru&s;alem, which he enacted in the yeare 12.22. Art. 31. and they be of this &s;ub&s;tance.
<Q>Now if either we or any one of our &s;ucce&s;|&s;ours in any time what&s;oeuer, go again&s;t this our plea&s;ure, we licence our &s;ubiects and giue them all power to contradict and re&s;i&s;t vs, &s;o as afterward they may neuer be branded with any note of trea&s;on or infamy for the &s;ame.</Q></P>
<P>And in the fir&s;t Epi&s;tle, the ninth Tit. of that Tripartite worke of the lawes of Hungary, he &s;aith expre&s;ly:
<Q>Let this be the fourth and ab&s;olute liberty, if any of the Kings or Princes happen to dero|gate from the freedome of the Noble men &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>As it followeth in the decrees of the fore|&s;aid
<PB REF="7">mo&s;t excellent Prince <HI>Andrew</HI> the &s;econd entituled King of Ieru&s;alem: and for the more &s;trict ob&s;eruation thereof, euery true King of Hungary, before his coronation is bound and accu&s;tomed to &s;weare the ob&s;eruance of the &s;ame conditions: to wit, To permit and con|&s;ent that men ri&s;e vp in armes again&s;t him without any note of trea&s;on, in &s;uch ca&s;es: as when he goeth in any thing about to re&s;traine from them their libertie. But in the Articles of the Diet held at Po&s;&s;onia, 1604. about the end there is one la&s;t of all which hath beene vnlaw|fully and forcibly added and couched in, and it goeth thus:</P>
<P>La&s;tly, his &s;acred Imperiall and royall Ma|ie&s;tie hauing vnder&s;tood not without great di&s;|plea&s;ure as well by reports woorthy of credit, as by two reque&s;ts by which the forenamed high prince <HI>Mathias</HI> Archduke of Au&s;tria, his mo&s;t deere brother, be&s;ought him to take part with them, who termed them&s;elues the better and &s;ounder part of the e&s;tate and order of the Realme of Hungary (of the which vnu&s;uall and vncoth kind of &s;peech he much marueiled, as al&s;o for their complaints of troubling their exerci&s;es of Religion, wa&s;ting their Churches and reuenewes in expences, and cha&s;ing away of their Mini&s;ters and preachers: of the which they had heeretofore complained to his High|ne&s;&s;e,
<PB REF="8">both by writing and worde of mouth, as al&s;o by ample declarations, and al&s;o be|&s;ought him to be a mediatour vnto his Maie|&s;tie for the re&s;titution of &s;uch thinges as had beene violently taken from them, that &s;o they might heereafter liue freely in the profe&s;&s;ion of their religion, who notwith&s;tanding &s;ollicited by his Highnes to declare more e&s;pecially, and to &s;pecifie at large the &s;ubiect of their writing, and the authours of the &s;ame, could neuer be brought to &s;ay any thing, nor to giue any fur|ther declaration either of the profe&s;sion of their religion, or of what Churches, what reuenewes had beene taken away from them, of the which they onely complained in generall termes, not di&s;cending to any particulars) and that conti|nuing in their male-contentednes, it was im|po&s;&s;ible to alter this their opinion: &s;uch di&s;|cord I &s;ay, being of no &s;mall power to &s;lacken and weaken the effects of al treati&s;es in the Par|liament, be&s;ides that it is a great &s;candall and an ill example to other States of the realme, could not but much aggreeue his Highne&s;&s;e &amp; his &s;acred Maie&s;tie: who, all a&s;toni&s;ht cannot call to minde what iniuries or what fa&s;heries they pretend to haue receiued in matters of re|ligion, nor what Churches, what reuenewes, e&s;pecially hereditary or ancient, could be ta|ken from them. His fore&s;aid Maie&s;ty is likewi&s;e
<PB REF="8">in doubt and can hardly bee re&s;olued &s;eeing their tumultuous pretences, which make him thinke, nay halfe per&s;wade him, that by the meanes of their religion they haue practi&s;ed &s;ome intelligence with the free cities of the realme, which be the proper demaines of his imperiall Maie&s;ty as well knowen King of Hungary. Now euen as his &s;acred imperiall and royall Maie&s;ty in imitation of &s;o many ho|ly Romane Emperours and Kings of Hungary his ance&s;tours and predece&s;&s;ours, vnfaignedly embraceth with ardent zeale the Catholike Romane religion, &s;o in like manner he purpo|&s;eth and de&s;ireth aboue all thinges, when hee hath purified and clen&s;ed it of all fal&s;e opini|ons and new-found doctrines, to make it to the glory and prai&s;e of the Almighty God, en|crea&s;e and flouri&s;h in all his realmes and pro|uinces: but e&s;pecially in this realme of Hunga|ry to maintaine and defend it with all his po|wer, as by the bond of his owne vocation hee findes him&s;elfe obliged. Heereupon his facred imperiall Maie&s;ty of his owne proper motion and of his royall and ab&s;olute power doth con|firme all tho&s;e ordinances, &s;tatutes and de|crees which heeretofore haue beene addre&s;&s;ed for the aduancement of the afore&s;aid Catho|like and Romane faith, a&s;well by King <HI>Stephen,</HI> the Apo&s;tle of the Hungarian nation, as by o|ther
<PB REF="9">deuout kings of Hungary his predece&s;|&s;ours: all which con&s;titutions he fully ratifies by this pre&s;ent Article, as if they had beene word by word heere &s;pecified. And to the end that heereafter in generall A&s;&s;emblies &amp; Diets where are handled matters of great importance and con&s;equence concerning realmes, no man &s;hall dare pre&s;ume vpon any incident colou|red pretext to in&s;ert any point or affaires of re|ligion which might &s;lacken the fore&s;aid pub|like affaires: his &s;acred Maie&s;ty wils and com|mands that vpon mo&s;t rigorous paines &s;uch a one e&s;cape not vnpuni&s;hed: but that immedi|ately men proceede again&s;t him and all &s;uch &s;emblable brablers, louers and embracers of nouelties: and that without any remi&s;&s;ion or pardon they bee &s;euerely cha&s;ti&s;ed and puni|&s;hed, following the decrees enacted again&s;t &s;uch by our predece&s;&s;ours, the Kings of Hun|gary, &s;o that others by their correction may learne and take example.</P>
<P>But leaue we the&s;e thinges as others, which to endure longer is impo&s;&s;ible, iudging by the former that there remaines no &s;peedier meanes to ridde vs of this in&s;upportable yoke, than the taking of armes, which we will imploy vp|on &s;uch as practi&s;ing again&s;t our religion and libertie, endeuour to roote out the Hungari|an nation. Now to the end men &s;houlde not
<PB REF="9">take vs for Apo&s;tates from the Chri&s;tian faith, or beleeue that we of &s;et purpo&s;e bandi|ed or emploied our forces again&s;t any that pro|fe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tianity, we thought it good to giue your thri&s;e illu&s;trious, re&s;pect woorthy, Gene|rous, Magnificent, and noble Lord&s;hips, our good and ancient neighbours a ta&s;t of our in|tention and of the cau&s;e of our commotions: to the end you might vnder&s;tand that neither pride, nor ambition, nor hatred conceiued a|gain&s;t any Chri&s;tian prince moued vs to the ta|king of armes, but an holy de&s;ire of protecting and defending our &s;elues again&s;t the oppre&s;|&s;ors of our freedome and our true and Ortho|doxall religion. As touching the aid we haue from the Turke and the Tartar we re&s;erue them for no other end, but to let the king of Poland and Moldauia &s;ee, that wee want not where|withall to &s;erue our &s;elues in time of need; it be|ing in our power to &s;end them backe againe when it &s;hall plea&s;e vs. Now although wee know that of all antiquity the Duchie of Sili&s;ie doth appertain as an inheritance of the realme of Hungary, yet were we willing to entertaine their good neighbourhood, liuing in good peace and amitie, which heeretofore we haue kept inuiolably.
