<HEAD>A TRVE DISCOVRSE Of the Plot of Mon&s;ieur du TERRAIL, again&s;t <HI>Geneua,</HI> the 19. of April, 1609.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is now about three yeeres &s;ince, aduice was giuen from &s;ome of good place, that <HI>Mon&s;ier du Terrail</HI> being much di&s;con|tented, that he was not &s;econded in his vndertakings in the Low-countreys, whereby he fore&s;aw that in the end all would be lo&s;t, had re&s;olued to &s;erue the Duke of <HI>Sauoy,</HI> and al&s;o had openly giuen out, that hee had in his Forge a notable enterpri&s;e vpon <HI>Geneua.</HI> In pur&s;ute of which, he was &s;eene &s;hortly af|ter to come to <HI>Paris,</HI> with pretence of reconciling him&s;elfe to the Kings fauour. But good aduerti&s;e|ment was giuen, that hee was to come for <HI>Sauoy.</HI> The&s;e his di&s;signes were then interrupted by a Mur|der, hee committed in the <HI>Louure</HI> in pre&s;ence of the
<PB N="2" REF="3" MS="y"> King. Whereupon to flie the great di&s;plea&s;ure of the King, he &s;oone turn'd head to the <HI>Archdukes,</HI> from whence after &s;ome &s;ixe Moneths &s;tay, he vndertooke a Pilgrimage to our Lady of <HI>Loretto,</HI> with one <HI>Ba&s;ti|de</HI> an Inginer, whom hee tooke to him for Coun&s;ell and aide of his executions: They went a foote, and in their returne had priuate conference with the D. of <HI>Sauoy.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding, the Count <HI>Fuentes</HI> adui|&s;ed this <HI>Terrail</HI> otherwi&s;e, giuing him to vnder&s;tand that the Duke would embrace his Seruice again&s;t <HI>Geneua,</HI> but it would bee his ouerthrow. The Duke communicated to him and his man his di&s;&s;ignes for <HI>Geneua,</HI> as &s;hall followingly appeare by Letters, and Confe&s;&s;ions; and from that time they re&s;ted in <HI>Sauoy,</HI> making two Voyages to <HI>Turin</HI> for the &s;ame affaire. They of <HI>Geneua</HI> had pre&s;ently great di&s;tru&s;t, receiuing aduerti&s;ements one in the necke of another, from all parts, of a notable, and in a maner vnauoidable en|terpri&s;e again&s;t them, carried by <HI>Mon&s;ieur du Terrail.</HI> All the Gouernours either of Prouinces or Places adioyning from the <HI>French</HI> King, gaue diuers very pregnant intelligences, but without any way di&s;co|uering the meanes.</P>
<P>The Sauoyards, already &s;ang the Triumph, cau|&s;ing to be in&s;erted in an Almanacke of one of their A&s;trologers, the certaintie of the Act about the Mo|neth of May (which was the time de&s;tined to the Ex|ecution) in the end of his predictions. Which Al|manacke Printed at <HI>Lions,</HI> was in exceeding reque&s;t for this particularitie. The <HI>French</HI> King al&s;o aduer|ti&s;ed the State of <HI>Geneua,</HI> that they &s;hould doe him a good &s;eruice, if they could &s;ei&s;e him, and gaue them
<PB N="3" REF="3" MS="y"> this meanes, a&s;&s;uring them that he was about <HI>Geneua,</HI> or the Countrey of <HI>Berne,</HI> and if they could di&s;pacth him, the Act would be to him mo&s;t acceptable.</P>
<P>While they were in this doubtfull mi&s;t, God &s;ent them a &s;mall light, was greater then all, which &s;ince &s;erued them as a Keye to open to the depth of the Plot, and to conuince fir&s;t the &s;eruant of <HI>Terrail,</HI> and afterward him&s;elfe. <HI>Terrail,</HI> hauing on a day plaide at Tenni&s;e at <HI>Chamberi,</HI> and retiring in his heate to rubbe and refre&s;h him&s;elfe, went into a bed; where, while a &s;eruant of the Tenni&s;e Court warmed him a &s;hirt, there came into him <HI>Ba&s;tide,</HI> and &s;ome other, well marked by this youth, and pre&s;ented him a Pa|per, which was the Plot of <HI>Geneua,</HI> and di&s;cour&s;t &s;oft|ly among them&s;elues, as of &s;ome matter of impor|tance: In&s;omuch as the fellow ouer hearing them, name &s;ome places of the Fortre&s;&s;e of <HI>Geneua,</HI> leant his eare with more attention; and gathered for cer|tain, that their di&s;cour&s;e was about &s;ome Enterpri&s;e, they had again&s;t that place; and heard that <HI>Terrail</HI> after long conference, made no difficultie &s;aue of the meanes to rai&s;e &s;ufficient Force to carrie the affaire. In which point being &s;atisfied by the a&s;&s;i&s;tants, hee brake out alowde in the&s;e tearmes. They are ours, they cannot e&s;cape vs. Which words being well marked by the youth of the Tenni&s;e Court, who had a Brother in the Garri&s;on of <HI>Geneua,</HI> and whome he was willing to &s;aue from this mi&s;chiefe, he went pre|&s;ently and di&s;couered it to a Towne&s;man of <HI>Geneua,</HI> who was then in <HI>Chamberi</HI> about &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;&s;e. This Town&s;man made faithfull report thereof to the Magi&s;trate of <HI>Geneua,</HI> and the brother of the youth.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4" MS="y">
<P>After this time, they of <HI>Geneua</HI> v&s;ed all deligence by &s;pies, to know his comming and going, and had him followed where&s;oeuer he went. In the end they had certaine notice of his pa&s;&s;ing the Mountaines &s;ome &s;ixe or &s;euen weekes before, and that hee was come backe by the way of the Lake <HI>Leman,</HI> wherup|on they gaue pre&s;ent aduerti&s;ement to all the Bay|liffes of the Countrey vnder the Lord of <HI>Berne.</HI> With the particular notes, and markes of the per&s;on of the &s;aid <HI>Terrail;</HI> praying them to haue an eye on him, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e them&s;elues of his per&s;on, in ca&s;e he pa&s;&s;e by their Territories: for which the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Berne</HI> being &s;o a&s;&s;ured of the practi&s;es of the Duke of <HI>Sauoy,</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e of <HI>Geneua</HI> their confederates and again&s;t them&s;elues al&s;o, gaue expre&s;&s;e commande|ment. To this came a remarkeable accident; a Dea|con of <HI>Iuerdun,</HI> a Towne of the <HI>Bernoys</HI> neare the frontire of the county of <HI>Burgoigne,</HI> being at <HI>Geneua</HI> came to &s;alute the chiefe <HI>Syndicke</HI> of the Towne, and brought him Letters; He, after other di&s;cour&s;e, told him of the manifold aduerti&s;ement they had, of the enemies di&s;&s;eignes again&s;t <HI>Geneua,</HI> and the country of <HI>Berne,</HI> but e&s;pecially the Towne of <HI>Iuerdun,</HI> a place of greate&s;t importance, being the key of the whole country, &s;trong by &s;cituation, though ill fortified, and bounding vtmo&s;t on <HI>Burgoigne;</HI> He gaue him al&s;o the marks of <HI>Terrail,</HI> of whom they had got a Picture at <HI>Geneua,</HI> becau&s;e he was to come in Per&s;on to take a view of the Towne. It hapned certaine dayes after, that <HI>Terrail</HI> returning from <HI>Turin</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the Lake, and arriued in the Country of <HI>Berne,</HI> but not at the
<PB N="5" REF="4"> known and ordinary port, went through the Coun|try, and vi&s;iting the places of mo&s;t importance, ne|uer lodging in Townes or knowne places, but vil|lages &amp; pea&s;ants hou&s;es til he came to <HI>Iuerdun:</HI> nei|ther &s;taide he there, but hauing &s;ome day left, pa&s;&s;ed on further. Pa&s;&s;ing ouer the Bridge of the Towne he met the Bayliffe with others, whom hee &s;aluted, but they ob&s;erued him not. Being pa&s;t the Bridge, making &s;hew of &s;tay for &s;ome other cau&s;e, hee turned backe toward <HI>Iuerdun,</HI> taking a diligent view of the Scite, defences, and &s;tate thereof, which was noted by them that were yet vpon the bridge, who thought hee did it onely for the marke of his way in trauell. But as he was gone a little further, the fore&s;aid Dea|con (being in a Garden) e&s;pied him comming a farre of: and ob&s;eruing his countenance began to &s;u&s;pect it might be <HI>Terrail;</HI> and to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elfe better, knowing that he was bald, made him a low congee to draw him to the putting of his hat, which he did; and the Deacon being now confirmed, ran pre&s;ently to the Bayliffe, telling him what he thought.</P>
<P>All they which were by, hauing marked the coun|tenance of <HI>Terrail,</HI> how he returned, and tooke &s;ur|uay of the place, wi&s;hed the Bailife to &s;end after him. He immediatly di&s;patched two, and gaue them in charge to ob&s;erue which way he tooke. If hee went from <HI>Burgoigne,</HI> they &s;hould returne without farther pur&s;uite; If toward, they &s;hould follow him to his lodging, without making any &s;hew to know him, but onely to be confirmed in the markes of his per|&s;on. There happened al&s;o, (as is a&s;&s;ured for truth)
<PB N="6" REF="5" MS="y"> another notable act, &s;igne or argument of Gods pro|uidence. <HI>Terrail</HI> hauing pa&s;t the village of <HI>Villeboeuf,</HI> which is not aboue halfe a league from the way of <HI>Burgoigne,</HI> to lodge in the &s;aid county that night, pa&s;|&s;ing ouer a &s;lough, his hor&s;e &s;tucke, &s;o that hee was faine to turne backe, and goe ouer a planke, vpon which his hor&s;e &s;tumbling, &s;o that hee halted, hee was faine to re&s;olue of lodging that night in <HI>Ville|boeuf.</HI> Hee had no guide with him, that knew the Country, which was a great cau&s;e of his &s;urpri&s;e; For a Guide might ea&s;ily haue &s;et him in the Coun|try betweene <HI>Berne,</HI> and <HI>Friburge,</HI> which in &s;ome pla|ces was not aboue two Harguebu&s;&s;e &s;hot from him, and there he had beene in fafety, through the inter|mixture of their iuri&s;diction. But at <HI>Friburg,</HI> hee had found all fauour, where his enterpri&s;es, had made them houer for aduantage again&s;t the <HI>Bernoys,</HI> vpon the great difference, which they haue had long for their land po&s;&s;e&s;t in common, and which the <HI>Fribur|gers</HI> would deuide to the detriment of tho&s;e of the re|formed religion, which is onely exerci&s;ed in almo&s;t al tho&s;e places. After his taking he was very &s;ory, and more when he knew how ea&s;ily he might haue been &s;aued by this meanes. Being come to the fore&s;aide Village of <HI>Villeboeuf,</HI> the two that were &s;ent from <HI>Iuerdun,</HI> hauing hou&s;'d him carefully, one of them re|turned with all &s;peede to the Bayliffe, to giue him the notice, who &s;ent pre&s;ently foure hor&s;-men, co~ducted by the Captaine of the Ca&s;tell of <HI>Iuerdun,</HI> to force him backe to the Bayliffe, and bad them &s;trengthen them&s;elues with the force of the Country. They at
<PB N="7" REF="5" MS="y"> their arriuall in the morning found <HI>Mon&s;ieur du Terrail</HI> booted, and ready to take hor&s;e; to whom the Ho&s;t, and other aduerti&s;ed of the bu&s;ines, decla|red that he could not pa&s;&s;e the Mountaines, for two great <HI>Corps du guard,</HI> that would let no man goe vn|till hee had giuen accompt of his Voyage to the Bayliffe of <HI>Iuerdun.</HI> This was &s;trengthened by the Hor&s;e that came that morning, at which <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> began to &s;hew a cur&s;ing di&s;like of the action, <HI>Terrail</HI> di&s;po&s;ed of him&s;elfe very peaceably, to returne to <HI>Iuerdun</HI> with the&s;e fiue or &s;ixe Hor&s;emen, whom with his people he might ea&s;ily haue &s;laine, or made to quit him by flight, if he had fore&s;eene his calamity. After his taking he repented him&s;elfe much, that hee had not &s;howne his great courage at this in&s;tant. But God blinded him, neither &s;ince hath beene noted in him any &s;parke of valour, and dexterity, whereby he might haue &s;aued him&s;elfe diuers times, as &s;hall appeare in the &s;equell; Being returned to <HI>Iuerdun,</HI> and demaunded by the Bayliffe (a &s;ubtle and experienced man) what hee was? He &s;aid hee was a Gentleman of <HI>Dauphine,</HI> and cald <HI>Paule de Con&s;tans,</HI> and going to <HI>Lorraine</HI> to follow a &s;ute, which con|cern'd him nearely, and therefore de&s;ir'd the Bayliffe for pre&s;ent di&s;patch: which an&s;wers &s;o &s;lightly grou~|ded, made the Bayliffe more &s;u&s;pitious, &s;o that hee re&s;olued to &s;ei&s;e him till hee were better informed, and demanded his &s;word, which he rendred him wil|lingly, and was lodged in an Inne in <HI>Iuerdun,</HI> with a guard &s;et vpon him of foure Men, day and night. Among other cau&s;es of &s;u&s;pition, being at <HI>Villeboeuf,</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="6"> and &s;eeing that he mu&s;t returne, hauing no meanes to e&s;cape, his people being taken by the multitude, he called for a Candle, with which he burnt a long Let|ter writ of all &s;ides; This being &s;eene and demaun|ded what it was, he a&s;&s;ured them that it was a Letter writ to <HI>Madam de Criqui</HI> his Kin&s;woman, to inter|cede for him to the King, and hath euer &s;ince to his end maintained it, and that he burnt it, lea&s;t his name and quality &s;hould be knowne. The Bayliffe to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elfe, &s;ent pre&s;ently to <HI>Geneua,</HI> to haue &s;ome that knew <HI>Terrail.</HI> They immediatly &s;ent one of the chiefe of the Towne, and a Souldier borne in <HI>Geneua,</HI> who had &s;erued vnder <HI>Terrail</HI> in the Low Countries, &amp; had giuen diuers adui&s;es of this enter|pri&s;e, which he had heard from <HI>Terrails</HI> owne mouth and &s;undry of his followers.</P>
<P>When the&s;e two arriued at <HI>Iuerdun,</HI> it was thought good, that the Souldier &s;hould come in vpon the &s;o|daine, where <HI>Terrail</HI> was at Supper; which hee did, and &s;ate downe rudely; making no &s;hew to &s;ee him, <HI>Terrail</HI> &s;eeing him, was much troubled and changed colour, as if his heart failed him, fayning hee was not well, and required to haue his bed warmed, and with|drew (being much out of temper) with his ordinary Guard to his Chamber, whither he cau&s;ed the Soul|dier to be called, and entertained him with very cour|teous di&s;cour&s;e, to enduce him to confe&s;&s;e, if he were not &s;ent thither to di&s;couer him: which the Souldi|er affirming, he began to talke &s;trangely to him: That he knew not what they of <HI>Geneua</HI> had to doe with him? that he had had diuers aduerti&s;ements in <HI>Cham|beri,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="6" MS="y"> that they laid wait for him at <HI>Geneua,</HI> &amp; that they would make v&s;e of this &s;ouldier to di&s;couer him: that he would die a braue Knight as he was, &amp; innocent. That he had neuer had to doe with them of <HI>Sauoy.</HI> Then he began to practi&s;e with the &s;ouldier to helpe him to &s;cape promi&s;ing him 1000. crownes, <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> offred him pre&s;ently 100. crowns down, which he re|fu&s;ed. <HI>Terraill</HI> prayd him to come, &amp; vi&s;ite him eare|ly in the morning: for hee had &s;ome great thing to tell him. In the meane time the Bailiffe aduerti&s;ed of the truth, and finding it not good hee &s;hould di&s;|cour&s;e any longer with the &s;ouldier, &s;ent to haue him brought to the Ca&s;tle with his &s;eruant, where they were &s;euerally lodged, and well guarded. After they knew at <HI>Geneua</HI> of his taking, they purpo&s;ed to &s;end to demaund him of the Lords of <HI>Berne,</HI> iudging that in their hands, they &s;hould hardly draw the trueth of the enterpri&s;e from him, and that mighty inter|ce&s;&s;ions, and other meanes might ea&s;ily &s;aue him. They &s;ent therefore to <HI>Berne,</HI> one of the Syndicks of <HI>Geneua,</HI> who being fir&s;t heard by the Councell of 25. at <HI>Berne,</HI> hee &s;howed them the great and iu&s;t grounds, that they of <HI>Geneua</HI> had to de&s;ire, to haue <HI>Terrail</HI> in their hands, that they had proofes and cer|tainties of his practi&s;es, that the witne&s;&s;es which they had at <HI>Geneua</HI> could not without danger bee &s;ent o|uer, that it was the common cau&s;e of both the en|leagued States, that the enterpri&s;es threatned an in|&s;eparable blow, that tho&s;e of <HI>Geneua</HI> in the like ca&s;es had deliuerd pri&s;oners to the Seigniory of <HI>Berne,</HI> that very lately the Kings Gari&s;on had accorded a pri&s;o|ner
<PB N="10" REF="7" MS="y"> enterpri&s;ing the like action, and that it would be of great con&s;equence to diuert all enterpri&s;ers, if they &s;aw, they could not with &s;afety come about <HI>Geneua,</HI> nor the territories of the King, or their Lord|&s;hips of <HI>Berne.</HI> In the end the le&s;&s;er Councell of <HI>Berne,</HI> finding them&s;elues much perplexed, a&s;&s;embled the great Councell of 200. and the &s;ame things beeing propo&s;ed to them, it was with great clemencie con|cluded by generall a&s;&s;ent, that <HI>Terrail</HI> &s;hould bee gi|uen into the hands of them of <HI>Geneua</HI> with his &s;er|uant.</P>
<P>The Amba&s;&s;ador of the King, re&s;ident at <HI>Solurre,</HI> much approoued this re&s;olution, fearing that hee could not bee enough a&s;&s;ured in the hands of tho&s;e of <HI>Berne.</HI> The newes of this grant being arriued at <HI>Geneua,</HI> they v&s;ed the extreame&s;t diligence and dex|teritie, to per&s;wade the Brother of the &s;eruant of the Tenni&s;e-court keeper of <HI>Chamberi</HI> aboue named, to goe to <HI>Chamberi</HI> and winne his brother to come with faire promi&s;es, and pretexts, which hee execu|ted faithfully and readily; &s;o that within three dayes he was at <HI>Geneua,</HI> and &s;erued infinitely to the Di&s;co|uerie. They al&s;o &s;udenly &s;ent the Souldier which had knowen <HI>Terrail</HI> to <HI>Monlori</HI> hard by <HI>Lyons,</HI> where they knew there was a Souldier, who had bene &s;om|times, <HI>Terrail</HI> his Hor&s;e-keeper, and had heard the di&s;cour&s;e touching the Enterpri&s;e of <HI>Geneua,</HI> and had oftentimes told it <HI>Beleine.</HI> (So was the name of the Souldier of <HI>Geneua.</HI>) But the Hor&s;e-keeper was not there, yet at <HI>Lyons</HI> the fore&s;aid <HI>Baleine</HI> found a Soul|dier his <HI>Camerado,</HI> who a&s;&s;ured him, that at diuers
<PB N="11" REF="7"> times the &s;aid Hor&s;e-keeper had told him all his bu|&s;ine&s;&s;e, whereof <HI>Baleine</HI> tooke an ample and expre&s;&s;e Copie by the hand of a publike Notarie. Mon|&s;ieur du <HI>Terrail</HI> was deliuered to the Syndicke of <HI>Ge|neua,</HI> and conducted by a &s;trong Gard of <HI>Iuerdun</HI> to <HI>Morges,</HI> a little Towne &s;cituate vpon the Lake <HI>Le|man,</HI> eight Leagues from <HI>Geneua,</HI> and there was put to the Gard of the Bailiffe of <HI>Morges,</HI> till hee &s;hould be &s;ent for to <HI>Geneua</HI> by water, which &s;tay of him was made by the two hundred, till they recei|ued a publike Acte vnder the Seale of <HI>Geneua,</HI> that this was done without con&s;equence, or preiudice of their iuri&s;diction, of their proper grace and curte&s;ie to their confederates.</P>
<P><HI>Terrail</HI> was caried alone from <HI>Iuerdum,</HI> his Serui|tour was left there, for feare they &s;hould Parlee, and practi&s;e together. By the way hee entertained the Syndicke with diuers de&s;perate di&s;cour&s;es; &s;ay|ing from time to time, what Death will you put me to at <HI>Geneua?</HI> He &s;hewed that hee was much afraid, they would deliuer him to the King; and for that had changd his Name and fa&s;hion; and that his feare was the King hauing him would keep him in the Ba|&s;tile. That if he were farre from him, he could make his peace to his great aduantage &amp; libertie, but now he mu&s;t &s;tand at the deuotion of the King: Yet &s;ince, he hath affirmed, that his greate&s;t de&s;ire was, hee might not fall into the hands of tho&s;e of <HI>Geneua</HI> but might be &s;ent to the King, hoping by his great Alli|ance ea&s;ily to make his peace. And &s;ince his com|ming hither hath v&s;ed greater cunning, giuing out
<PB N="12" REF="8" MS="y"> that he di&s;&s;waded the Duke of <HI>Sauoy</HI> in the Enter|pri&s;e of <HI>Geneua,</HI> but with &s;o friuolous rea&s;ons that we ea&s;ily knew, they were Di&s;cour&s;es built but to deceiue. He lulled the Bayliffe of <HI>Morges</HI> &s;o a&s;leepe with faire words and promi&s;es, that they with Sig|neur <HI>D'e&s;diguieres</HI> &s;ent to intercede for him to <HI>Berne,</HI> had free pa&s;&s;age thorough <HI>Morges;</HI> and the Bailiffe of <HI>Morges</HI> refu&s;ed to yeeld him to them, which &s;hould next Morning haue caried him by water to <HI>Geneua,</HI> and gaue <HI>Terrail</HI> good meanes to &s;aue him|&s;elfe, if God had not left him de&s;titute of his great courage and &s;pirit. Hee had there al&s;o a very &s;lender Gard, libertie to walke about all the Ca&s;tle, meanes of Conference with whom hee would, and to write to his friends.</P>
<P>Hee got the fauour of the people there, by his good behauiour, iu&s;tification, and bountie: So that if but twentie re&s;olute men had pre&s;ented them|&s;elues, he might haue bene re&s;cued, and the ea&s;ier, in re&s;pect the Pa&s;&s;age ouer, was but three &s;mall French Leagues; and the other Bank was wholly the Dukes. Nay, if he had had aduerti&s;ement but to come out of the Ca&s;tle, he had beene &s;afe by them of <HI>Morges,</HI> they were &s;o much at his deuotion.</P>
<P>They of <HI>Geneua</HI> &s;ent pre&s;ently to <HI>Berne</HI> to com|plaine, and re-enforce their reque&s;t to haue him, which was confirmed with great indignation, and threatnings again&s;t the Bailiffe of <HI>Morges.</HI> The in|terce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Mon&s;ier D'e&s;diguieres,</HI> was very faint, and conditionall, as that if hee had not enterpri&s;ed any thing again&s;t the King, or the Lords of <HI>Berne,</HI> or <HI>Ge|neu&acirc;:</HI>

Since, the Bailiffe was &s;euerely cited by a day to appeare in per&s;on at <HI>Berne;</HI> and it is held, that he is put already from his charge, and &s;hal be from his ho|nours, there being many pre&s;umptions, and &s;ome confe&s;&s;ions of <HI>Terrail,</HI> that he was promi&s;ed tenne thou&s;and Crownes, if he &s;o wrought, that hee might not be carried to <HI>Geneua,</HI> or at lea&s;t that his man might not come there: which the fore&s;aid Bailiffe had promi&s;ed him, hoping by the meanes of his great credite, and kindred to make it good. The Pa|pi&s;ts Cantons and the kindred of <HI>Terrail</HI> trauelled earne&s;tly at <HI>Berne</HI> to &s;aue him. Some of them ariued too late. The Lords of <HI>Berne</HI> haue carried them|&s;elues very affectionately and zealou&s;ly, in this bu&s;i|ne&s;&s;e, moued thereto chiefly by the braues of tho&s;e of <HI>Friburge,</HI> who with the wind of this enterpri&s;e had blowne vp their valours, but &s;ince are become &s;lacke and &s;upple. <HI>Terrail</HI> was caried by water in a Frigate, armed, and by the way, one of the Seigniors of the citie which accompanied him, made him very gra|tious, and honorable offer; that if he would declare what might appertaine to the pre&s;ent a&s;&s;urance of their citie, he would promi&s;e him in the name of the Seigniorie, pardon, libertie, courteous v&s;age, and in|terce&s;&s;ion for him to the King. But he &s;till denied all, though much troubled, and perplexed; &s;aying, that he was no man to be tortured, that they ought not
<PB N="14" REF="9"> to offer him the racke; that he &s;hould then &s;peake as well what was not; as what was. Being ariued at <HI>Geneua,</HI> the fourteenth of April, about midnight, they lodgd him in the Towne hou&s;e well guarded. The next morning being &s;ent for to the Councell, they againe be&s;pake him very honorably, &amp; opened vnto him, the power which they had to &s;aue him, and re|couer him to France; that hee &s;hould quit them of the paines of producing &s;uch things, as they had in their hands to conuince him, and &s;hould be aiding to him&s;elfe; promi&s;ing him all courteous entertaine|ment, freedom, and mediation to the King. This was repeated more then &s;ixe times. But &s;til he per&s;i&s;ted to denie with great execrations, renouncing his part in Paradi&s;e, &amp; in &s;uch manner, &amp;c. So that in the end, it was told him, &s;ince hee would not bee good to him|&s;elfe, there was no more grace for him: and after that, made him an&s;were as a <HI>Criminall,</HI> &s;peaking to him rough, and har&s;hly, which much amated him. Being confronted with the &s;ouldier <HI>La Baleine,</HI> hee denied all euen to the lea&s;t things, and where al apparance made again&s;t him. Three dayes after his arriuall, His man was brought to <HI>Geneua,</HI> and pre|&s;ently led to the pri&s;on: whether <HI>Terrail</HI> was alrea|dy remoued; In the morning the 15. of Aprill, <HI>Ba|&s;tide</HI> was &s;howne to the yong fellow of the Tennis Court of <HI>Chamberi,</HI> from whom came the &s;ure&s;t in|telligence: who marking with good view his coun|tenance, pronounced a&s;&s;uredly, that this was he that pre&s;ented the fore&s;ayd paper to <HI>Terrail:</HI> and had held with him the di&s;cour&s;e aboue mentioned: The
<PB N="15" REF="9" MS="y"> yong man being asked apart what apparell <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> had then on, told them, and <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> confe&s;&s;ed it to be true, but denied the fact of the paper, or any &s;uch co~|munication, as al&s;o did <HI>Terrail.</HI> In the end, they per|ceiuing the yong man con&s;tant to what he had &s;aid; it was re&s;olued, that <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> &s;hould be put to the tor|ture, which was done. He bare two great ierkes of the &s;trappado, at the third he confe&s;t all. This re&s;o|lution of putting <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> to the torture, was al&s;o founded vpon this rea&s;on. A Citizen of <HI>Geneua</HI> ha|uing by chance &s;eene <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> in the pri&s;on yard, affir|med that he had &s;upped one night with the &s;aid <HI>Ba|&s;tide</HI> in a village hard by, and that in the morning the ho&s;te of the place told him, that this <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> had drawne &s;euerall cards and plots of Fortification, be|fore his departure; whereby he was knowen by the ho&s;te for an Enginer: of which being then asked, he confe&s;&s;ed it, and yet afterward in pri&s;on denied all &s;tiffely. But now hauing confe&s;&s;ed all, he was con|fronted with <HI>Terrail,</HI> who began to di&s;couer it. But <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> per&s;euered in his affirmation, and <HI>Terrail</HI> was pre&s;ented to the torture, wher, with teares in his eies, he confe&s;&s;ed the whole fact voluntarily, and receiued no touch. His confe&s;&s;ions concerned <HI>Geneua, Berne,</HI> the French King, and the States of the Low Coun|try; but tho&s;e concerning <HI>Berne</HI> and <HI>Geneua,</HI> were onely made publike: The King and the States were pre&s;ently aduerti&s;ed of that concerned them. Fir&s;t, the &s;aid <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> confe&s;&s;ed that he was an Enginer, and had long &s;erued the Archduke; &s;ince, hee had giuen him&s;elfe to <HI>Terrail,</HI> to execute his vndertaking. Hee
<PB N="16" REF="10"> had bin bred a Scholler, a braue fellow of his per&s;on, very &s;ubtill, and experienced in matter of fortificati|on, and a cunning viewer of their weakene&s;&s;es. He returned from his pilgrimage about foure or fiue mo+neths &s;ince, with his ma&s;ter. Pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Turin,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Sauoy</HI> had conference with them both about the towne of <HI>Geneua,</HI> to the &s;urpri&s;e whereof they offered him their &s;eruice, and for the following of this de&s;igne re&s;olued to vi&s;ite, and take view of the gates, the guardes, the water port, and whole &s;tate of the towne: whereupon <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> vndertooke the go|ing into the towne, and hauing viewed it all; repor|ted the whole Plot of the Town, what was reformed in the fortification &s;ince the la&s;t <HI>E&s;calada:</HI> Following which, <HI>Terrails</HI> old Plot was altered; nor could <HI>Ter|rail</HI> &amp; <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> agree on the meanes of the Enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Terrail</HI> inclining to the &s;urpri&s;e of &s;ome port by <HI>Petard,</HI> or otherwi&s;e. <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> vrged againe, that it was a matter of infinite hazard, for the great number of defences which are at the Gates, and the dilligence which they v&s;e, and after &s;ome conte&s;t, the deui&s;e of <HI>Ba&s;tide,</HI> was approued to take the way of the water port, which was not &s;o well Guarded, and which being po&s;&s;e&s;t by a competent number, they might ea&s;ily come vp to the hart of the Towne, without daunger, and the Entrie well executed, <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> made no difficulty in the carying of the enter|pri&s;e, being an ea&s;ie thing to Sea&s;e on the water port, by rea&s;on of the nearene&s;&s;e, and he did adui&s;e to ca&s;t them&s;elues into certaine narrow Lanes vnchay|ned and couered ouer, which hereafter the Towne hath purpo&s;ed to clo&s;e vp for preuention of the like.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="10" MS="y">
<P><HI>Terrail</HI> hauing heard all, yeelded him&s;elfe to this adui&s;e; and parted with <HI>Ba&s;tide,</HI> to pa&s;&s;e him&s;elfe ouer, to the other &s;ide of the Lake aboue at <HI>Euian,</HI> and &s;taid there eight daies; informing him&s;elfe particular|ly of all the water men, which v&s;ed to <HI>Geneua</HI> in great numbers, about the di&s;po&s;ition, the Guides, and de|fences of the water port, their &s;earching of Boates, and other things pertaining to the Nauigation of the Lake, and learned many defaults in the Guard, and to be more a&s;&s;ured &s;ent <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> to <HI>Morges</HI> to the end, that taking pa&s;&s;age in one of the <HI>Barques</HI> of <HI>Gene|ua,</HI> that on certaine daies goe thether to Market, hee might without &s;u&s;picion at their returne ob&s;erue the whole &s;tate of the water port, and the landing place: which he &s;o readily, and ably executed, that no man &s;u&s;pected him. Such a like &s;pie was taken a|bout two yeares ago, who had gro&s;&s;ely tooke a view of the chaines; and being skared, and taken faltering in his an&s;wers, confe&s;&s;ed (by Torture) that hee was &s;ent to view the place, without knowing any other thing belonging to the enterpri&s;e, or &s;o much as the man that &s;ent him: for which he was taken to be one of <HI>Terrails</HI> party, and was hanged: &s;ince they haue re-enforced the port, with a ranke of double chaines, fifty paces from the fir&s;t, but this would not &s;erue to warrant again&s;t an enterpri&s;e like that of <HI>Sluce.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Terrail</HI> then, and <HI>Ba&s;tide,</HI> who returned to him by Land, hauing a new, viewed the water port by which he pa&s;t, a&s;&s;ured them&s;elues of the certainty and facili|ty of the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and tooke vpon them, that they two would be the chiefe and leaders in the executi|on. The Proiect was this, <HI>Geneua</HI> hath on the <HI>North</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="11"> &s;ide the Lake <HI>Leman</HI> which &s;tretcheth it &s;elfe in length at lea&s;t fifty French Leagues; on the We&s;t &s;ide the Country of <HI>Berne;</HI> on the Ea&s;t &s;ide that of <HI>Sauoy;</HI> In the height of which there are great Moun|taines, where growes great &s;tore of Wood, which the watermen of <HI>Geneua</HI> v&s;ually bring home for fuell to their Towne, in great Flat Boates, and chiefely in|tend this worke about the Moneth of May, in great troupes, the Wood being then dry which was felled the <HI>Autumne</HI> before. The de&s;igne of <HI>Terrail</HI> was to Sea&s;e foure or fiue of the&s;e great Boates, and to lodge couertly vnder the wood piled for the nonce, in each Boate, a hundred, or two hundred of tho&s;e men, which might come in without any &s;u&s;picion, the counterfait watermen, being clothed in the ha|bite of ours: As for the &s;earch &s;huld be made at their entry, they cared not for it, being determined to leap out all at once, and kill. For the Mu&s;ter of tho&s;e troopes it &s;hould be in the Valleyes of tho&s;e Moun|taines, remoued from the commerce of the people of <HI>Geneua,</HI> &amp; at the appointed time charge tho&s;e Boates, with the ri&s;ing and fauor of the Moone, which v&s;eth to &s;hine certaine dayes of that Moneth. <HI>Terrail</HI> was appointed to be in the fir&s;t Boate, after the fir&s;t on&s;et was giuen, other troopes &s;hould bee ready of Knights and Gentlemen, which they might ea&s;ily rai&s;e, vnder the pretext of the Mariage of <HI>Moun&s;ieur Denemours,</HI> which was to be celebrated at <HI>Aneci</HI> in <HI>Sa+uoy,</HI> &s;ixe Leagues from <HI>Geneua,</HI> and though the defer|ring and &s;toppe of this Mariage might cau&s;e &s;ome difficulty, yet they had &s;uch good incountry and op|portunitie el&s;ewhere, that they held the Action for|infallible.
<PB N="19" REF="11" MS="y"> The ea&s;ine&s;&s;e was this, that they might imbarque &s;ecretly hauing the winde fauourable to cary them in a quarter of the time, that was required by Land, the &s;earch was v&s;ed to be made very negli|gently, and within the Towne they had nothing to care for, the &s;aid &s;earch being made a good while after the Boates were arriued, fiue hundred men or more brought &s;odainely into the Towne, might ea&s;ily giue worke to all the people, if they were po&s;&s;e&s;t but of a Canon at a Gate, and the water port, by which the Land-forces might enter in gro&s;&s;e and a flote.

<P><HI>Terrail</HI> went into the Low-Counrries to take his leaue of the Arch-duke, and bring away the re&s;t of his goods, which he had there, and draw along with him a number of the be&s;t executioners, and watermen that he could get.</P>
<P><HI>Terrail</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> agreed, e&s;pecially in their con|fe&s;&s;ions, whereby it appeared that the chiefe ground of their enterpri&s;e proceeded from them; again&s;t which they haue &s;ince giuen very good preuentions for our &s;afty hereafter, and al&s;o <HI>Terrail</HI> drew, on a paper with his owne hand, a deui&s;e to warrant any Gates again&s;t a Petard.</P>

<P><HI>Terrail</HI> reque&s;ted that they would keepe him aliue betweene foure Walls, and that they would not ca&s;t away the Soule of <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> by an extraordinary death. <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> di&s;po&s;ed him&s;elfe to death with an incredible magnanimity, hauing very Chri&s;tianly quitted all &s;uper&s;tition, and liuely embracing what&s;oeuer was propounded to him of the pure Doctrine of the Go&s;pell. <HI>Terrail</HI> was condemned to bee beheaded, which was executed the ninth of Aprill, <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> to be hanged, which was done on the Friday following being the 21. both executions were done within the City, in the place of <HI>Molard. Terrail</HI> dyed ve|ry &s;toutly, without changing any whit his colour or countenance, and without any ge&s;ture vnworthy his life pa&s;t; he de&s;ired that he might haue had his hands free: but the cu&s;tome and feare of his courage denyed it, and gayned him great pitty. Hee &s;hewed before his execution great piety, little mingled with &s;uper&s;tition, the apprehen&s;ion of which things hee put off, by the holy exhortations the Mini&s;ters made him, which he receiued with a peaceable and gentle Spirit, thanking God, who had giuen him time at his death to be conuerted to him, and meanes to ob|taine pardon for his faultes; in cogitation of which he &s;pent many teares, &s;ighes, and prayers, di&s;pi&s;ing the re&s;t, as death, the &s;hame of his puni&s;hment, and the world, while they propo&s;ed to him comfort with all grauity, honour and comi&s;eration po&s;&s;ible, his teares made the &s;tanders by weepe, and forget all &s;ini&s;ter de&s;ire of reuenge, Hee made his will, and be|queathed twenty Crownes to the poore of <HI>Geneua.</HI> The day before his execution they receiued Letters
<PB N="21" REF="12"> from his mother adre&s;t to him, in which &s;hee com|forted him, and a&s;&s;ured him of the meanes they made for him in the Court of <HI>France,</HI> &s;peaking &s;till of his innocencie. <HI>Ba&s;tide</HI> edified more by his death, yet was exceeding &s;orie, that Torture had made him <HI>Terrails</HI> accu&s;er, of who&s;e death hee knew and wi&s;hed hee had beene rather torne to pieces by foure Hor&s;es. There was no interce&s;&s;ion made for <HI>Terrail</HI> in <HI>Geneua,</HI> but by <HI>D'e&s;diguieres,</HI> who was allied to him by his wife decea&s;ed, he &s;ent his Secretary <HI>Moun&s;ieur To|nard,</HI> who v&s;ed all meanes po&s;&s;ible to haue changed the Sentence of death into perpetual impri&s;onment, but many vrgent rea&s;ons would not permit it, which they laboured to make the &s;aid <HI>Moun&s;ieur du Tonard,</HI> and the Lord <HI>D'e&s;diguieres</HI> vnder&s;tand by ample and honourable Letters. We vnder&s;tood that the Mo|ther of <HI>Terrail</HI> was comming, accompanied with diuers of the Nobility of <HI>Dauphine</HI> to mediate the &s;ame; But <HI>Moun&s;ieur du Tonard</HI> meeting them at <HI>Remilli,</HI> told them he was already di&s;patched, where|vpon they returned, &s;ending only to intreat his body, which was in like maner denyed for great rea&s;ons be|ing already buried in the Bullwarke, where the heads of tho&s;e were interred that were &s;laine at the <HI>E&s;cala|da.</HI> He might haue made v&s;e of the grace they pre|&s;ented him in the beginning, but he though that they could not conuince him, relying on the promi&s;es that the Bayliffe of <HI>Morges</HI> made him, that his man &s;hould not be deliuered into their hands, as indeede he was &s;taid at the in&s;tance of that Bayliffe, till they made a &s;econd voyage for him.

<P>Solemne thank&s;giuing was rendred for this deli|uerance throughout all the Churches, the Sunday following being the 23. of Aprill. The <HI>Sauoyardes</HI> are much confounded; Some of <HI>Dauphyne,</HI> skou|ring about <HI>Geneua,</HI> haue v&s;ed great threates; but it is hoped, that when the King &s;hall declare his will, it will &s;tifle all the&s;e braues.
