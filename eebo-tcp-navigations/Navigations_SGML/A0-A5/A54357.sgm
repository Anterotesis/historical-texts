<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Profe&s;&s;ion of Arms has in all Ages been in &s;uch E&s;teem, that the Great Men of the World have made it their Study; Emperours and Kings have preferred the Name of a Souldier above the re&s;t of their Glo|rious Titles, and indeed, the Sword is pro|perly the Bullwark of a Kingdom, without which the Laws would prove weak and in|effectual; for did not the Violaters fear that Power, which is of force to compel them to undergoe the Penalties of the Laws, they would e&s;teem them but a dead Letter: And to &s;peak more plain, The Souldier is the Guard of Liberty, Pro|perty, and what ever is dear to Mankind, as being at all times ready to &s;acrifice his Life for the Defence of his Country; nor are the Advantages &s;mall that may incite men to the &s;tudy of the <HI>Military Art,</HI> for it is often &s;een, that Per&s;ons of mean Birth
<PB REF="3"> and Fortune, have by their Courage and Indu&s;try become great Commanders; and many times Generals of Armies: Courage indeed, is a great Qualification in the profe&s;&s;ion of Arms, but without Experi|ence it frequently does hurt, and rarely rai&s;es a man to any con&s;iderable Station; but joyned with Experience, and kept with|in bounds, it wants but Opportunity to make him Eminent, though many Books of this kind have appeared in the World, yet being either of an extraordinary Price, or wanting &s;omewhat new, and nece&s;&s;ary to be known, we thought fit, e&s;pecially for the In|&s;truction of young Souldiers, to compile in a &s;mall Volume &s;uch a Body of <HI>Military Di&s;ciplin'd,</HI> &amp;c. as at this time is Pra|ctical, and approved by the great Captains of the Age, that they may be able to un|der&s;tand their Duty, and perform it with Exactne&s;s and Dexterity; &s;o that being well grounded in the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and ho|nourable Art, their Courage, Zeal, and Loyalty, may not only fru&s;trate the Pro|jects of our Enemies abroad, and at home, but render the&s;e Kingdoms Dreadful to our Neighbours, and Happy in them&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD>The Perfection of <HI>MILITARY DISCIPLINE</HI> After the Newe&s;t Method, As Practi&s;ed In <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t promi&s;ing things to Pre|ferment in this great Art, are Va|lour and Obedience, for it is not only very commendable when occa&s;ion offers to fight Valiantly, but likewi&s;e to obey Pa|tiently, the latter being looked upon as a great Vertue; to the&s;e Experience acquired by Labour, and Indu&s;try being joyned, Difficul|ties will the ea&s;ier be overcome; a man may indeed, a long time bare Arms, and yet be ignorant in many things he ought materially to know; but an Indu&s;trious Mind will ac|compli&s;h much in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal things in the <HI>Military Art</HI> to be con&s;idered, and in the fir&s;t place, tho&s;e properly called the Sen&s;es, by which we receive Adverti&s;ement, as the Eye and
<PB N="2" REF="4"> the Ear; and in this ca&s;e a &s;trict Ob&s;ervance, and Silence is required, that the one and the other may not be mi&s;taken. The Signes u&s;ed in War, are commonly three, <HI>viz. The Voice which conveys the word of Command to the Ear. The Trumpet or Drum which by certain Sounds and Beats give notice to the Cavalry and Infan|try what is to be done.</HI> And the la&s;t is, <HI>The Hand Colours, or other Signs which inform the Eye;</HI> and the&s;e are called <HI>Vocal Semi-vocal</HI> and <HI>Mute,</HI> and the&s;e mu&s;t be perfectly under|&s;tood, or el&s;e by mi&s;take, or not knowing what to do, a Souldier may run into great Error, e&s;pecially in Battle, loo&s;ing him&s;elf, and being the occa&s;ion of the lo&s;s others: But of this more hereafter.</P>
<P>When it happens that a Regiment has the word of Command to draw out, then ought the Major, or Adjutant, to A&s;&s;ign each Com|pany its proper Po&s;t, and this mu&s;t be done by placing the elde&s;t Company upon the Right, and the next to that on the Left, and &s;o in order to the younge&s;t, who by this meanes will come into the Center, and every Company or Body of Men are to be drawn up in the beginning at the &s;ame order they march at, as well in Rank, as File, the &s;ingle Companies always taking notice to leave &s;o much room as the Serjeants and Drums may place them&s;elves in, on the Right and Left of each Company: Then ob&s;erve before you
<PB N="3" REF="4"> form your Battalions, to draw up from every Company the odd Men, forming in Oppo|&s;ition a Rank at fifty paces in di&s;tance from the head of each Company, that no broken Files may appear; and by this means with more &s;peed and dexterity you may compleat the Files.</P>
<P>The Battalions may be form'd, the Com|panies di&s;po&s;ed in order as afore&s;aid by the&s;e words of Command, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. <HI>Have a care to form the Battalion.</HI> 2. <HI>Mu&s;queteers, to the Right and Left outwards.</HI> 3. <HI>Pikes, to the Right and Left inwards.</HI> 4. <HI>March inter|changing Ground.</HI> Upon the interchange of Ground by the Pikes and Mu&s;queteers; the fir&s;t Rank of Pikes mu&s;t pa&s;s before the fir&s;t Rank of Mu&s;queteers: And it ever is to be noted, That after Command for moving of any kind, no man &s;tir till the word <HI>March</HI> be uttered, &s;o that they may move joyntly, and not break the Order.</P>
<P>The Ground being changed, the Souldiers mu&s;t forbear to face to their Leaders till they be &s;o commanded, which done, they are in Battalia at clo&s;e Order in File; and the Of|ficers in this ca&s;e mu&s;t have a regard to the whole, as not limitted to their particular Companies, and the Commandant mu&s;t take notice how many Serjeants are pre&s;ent, and if the Battalian contain eight or ten Companies, or a bigger number, and every Company two
<PB N="4" REF="5"> Serjeants, and three Corporals de&s;igned to do the duty of Serjeants, two mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily be placed on each Rank, to the Right and Left, and the others mu&s;t have their Sta|tions in the Rear; but if the Serjeants be not &s;o many, then there will be allowed but one to each Rank, to the Right and Left, and the re&s;t in the Rear, making a Parallel Rank to the Souldiers, keeping three paces di&s;tance from the Rank.</P>
<P>The Serjeants thus placed, the Drums mu&s;t &s;tand one half on the Right, and the o|ther half on the Left, that they may range directly with the fir&s;t Rank of the Souldiers; but if the Drums be more than u&s;ual, and the ground be &s;treight, then they may be di&s;|po&s;ed in two Ranks, on the Right and Left, ranging with the two fir&s;t Ranks of Soul|diers ever &s;linging their Drums, unle&s;s con|trary Command be given. The <HI>Hoitboys,</HI> if there be any, are to take the right of the Drums which are on the right of the Batta|lion ranging with them in the &s;ame Ranks.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ion Officers, according to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Military Di&s;cipline, are to take their places at the head of the Battalion, as the Colours are drawn; but more of this hereafter. In this clo&s;e Order, the Ranks, by the care of the Serjeants, are to have twelve large Feet di&s;tance between Rank and Rank, which mu&s;t be kept very even, the
<PB N="5" REF="5"> Chief Commandant to place him&s;elf about forty paces di&s;tant from the Center of the Pikes.</P>
<P>As to the words of Command, they mu&s;t be given with deliberation, lea&s;t command|ing too fa&s;t put the Souldiers be&s;ide their Ex|erci&s;e; Silence being commanded, the next word of Command is,</P>
<P><HI>Files, open to the Right</HI> (or to the Left) <HI>to your Order. March.</HI></P>
<P>At the&s;e words each Souldier turns to the hand mentioned, and after a &s;hort &s;tand the Flanking Searjeants lead the Ranks (which by this means are Files) marching &s;lowly for|ward by &s;hort &s;teps; the Serjeants with ad|vanced Halberts, the Iron uppermo&s;t: every man, if they move to the Right, ob&s;erving the left-hand man, if to the Left, the con|trary, and as &s;oon as the la&s;t man but one of the fir&s;t Rank &s;tirs, the Command is to be given for them all to <HI>Halt.</HI> And in proceed|ing to open Files after this manner, no man ought to move till his Leader be at four foot di&s;tance, and then to move with equal pace and keep the di&s;tance, &s;o that when faced to the proper Front, there will be three foot &s;pace between them: The word of Com|mand to <HI>Halt</HI> being given; the word of Com|mand &s;ucceeding is,</P>
<P><HI>To your Leader.</HI></P>
<PB N="6" REF="6">
<P>In this ca&s;e the Captains and Lieutenants are to carry their Pikes comported ever when they move to the Right, or Left; the En|&s;igns being Advanced, the Ranks mu&s;t al&s;o be kept even at twelve feet di&s;tance, which is the Serjeants Care, the Files mu&s;t be likewi&s;e at three feet di&s;tance, each having regard to his right and left-hand man.</P>
<P>To draw the Officers from the Front of the Battalion to the Rear; the&s;e words mu&s;t be u&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Have a care of the Exerci&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this the Mu&s;queteers are to draw off their right-hand Gloves; and &s;tick them in their Girdles. The next words are, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Officers take your Po&s;ts of Exerci&s;e in the Rear. March.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this the Officers mu&s;t face to the right-about, the Captains marching a pretty &s;wift pace in the one Rank, and the Lieute|nants and Colours in another, two paces be|hind; Captains and Lieutenants, carrying their Pikes Advanced; being in the Rear, the Lieutenants and En&s;igns are to take their places in a Rank about twelve feet from the Serjeants; the Captains ought to be thirteen paces from the la&s;t Rank of Souldiers, and the Lieutenants and Colours eleven; and at this word of Command, or further &s;ignal from the Officers to take their Po&s;ts of Exer|ci&s;e in the Rear, &s;ix Serjeants of the Rear
<PB N="7" REF="6"> mu&s;t march thorough the Intervals of the Files, po&s;ting them&s;elves in the Front forty &s;ix paces from the fir&s;t Rank of Souldiers, being advanced &s;ix paces before the Chief Commandant, making by their ranging, a parallel Line with the Battalion, keeping the Front free, and undi&s;ordered. This word being likewi&s;e given, the Pike men mu&s;t joyn their left-hands with their Pikes, placing them even with their Shoulder.</P>
<P>We &s;uppo&s;e the Mu&s;queteers to have Shoul|dered, and the Pikes Advanced, none are to &s;peak after Silence is Commanded, but the Officer in Chief who thus proceeds,</P>

<HEAD>An Explanation of the Words of Com|mand or Po&s;tures, in Exerci&s;ing the <HI>Fire-Lock, Musket,</HI> and how they mu&s;t be performed.</HEAD>
<P>WHen you enter upon Exerci&s;e, whe|ther it be of Pike or Musket, you mu&s;t ob&s;erve to keep your at Feet a moderate di&s;tance, that you may upon occa&s;ion retain your full Force and Strength, ever keeping the left Heel firm, and &s;et the right Feet: But as to the Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Lay your right Hand on your Musket.</HI></P>
<P>In this Action the Lock being uppermo&s;t, turn your Barrel towards you, and your Fin|gers being extended, lay your right Hand ju&s;t behind the Lock, then clo&s;e the butt end of your Musket to your Shoulder, &s;o that it may in all parts be of an equal height.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Poi&s;e your Musket.</HI></P>
<P>Here you mu&s;t hold your Musket with a hard gra&s;p, facing to the Right, and turn|ing with a quick motion upon your left Heel, keeping your Musket exactly before you, the height of it between your Shoulders, your right Elbow on your &s;ide, and your Feet at a moderate di&s;tance, that turning about, the point of your left Toe may be to the Front, and that of your right, as you face to the left
<PB N="11" REF="8"> Heel, being directly again&s;t the middle your right Foot; and &s;o are you in a re&s;ting Po&s;ture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Re&s;t your Musket.</HI></P>
<P>In performing this, let your Musket &s;lide, or &s;ink down to your left hand, letting down your Arm as low as po&s;&s;ible, without &s;toop|ing, receiving the Musket directly where the Scowerer enters into the Stock, &s;uffering your hand to touch no part of the Barrel; let it be a little &s;tooping from perpendicular about half a foot from your &s;ide, keeping your right hand with your fingers extended behind the Lock.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Cock your Musket.</HI></P>
<P>In this doing, place the Thumb of your right Hand and your Finger behind the Trig|ger, and clapping it again&s;t your Thigh, Cock, keeping for the better &s;ecurity your Thumb upon the Cock.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Guard your Musket.</HI></P>
<P>In Guarding your Musket, bring it in the foregoing Po&s;ture with a very quick motion &s;traight before you to the Recover, your left hand equal with your Mouth but a|bout half a foot di&s;tance, not &s;tooping, nor &s;uffering your Musket to &s;ink, ob&s;erving in bringing up the Musket, before which is a Recovering, to make the right Heel come to the left In&s;tep, keeping your Musket right perpendicular.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="12" REF="9">6. <HI>Pre&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>In this ca&s;e, fall back with your right Leg, &s;o that the left Heel be again&s;t the middle of the right Foot, &s;uffering the butt end to ri&s;e to you Shoulder, &s;etting it fa&s;t, your right Elbow even with the height of the Piece, be|ing ever ready to pull the Trigger with the fourth Finger of your right Hand, bending the left Knee a little, and keeping the right very &s;teady, levelling brea&s;t high.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Fire.</HI></P>
<P>Here you mu&s;t keep true motion in draw|ing the Trigger, doing it all together, &s;o that the Fire of a Battalion may give but one Report, or appear to be no more than one Fla&s;h, the body &s;teady, and the Musket clo&s;e to the Shoulder till the next word of Com|mand, which is,</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Recover your Arms.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon &s;uffer the butt end of your Mus|ket to &s;ink in both hands, till it be perpendi|cular, the right under the Cock, and the left as high as your Mouth always upon a Re|covery, bringing it up before you upon a very quick motion, turning the right Heel, &s;o that it may come up with the left In|&s;tep.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Half bend your Musket.</HI></P>
<P>With your right Leg fall back, let the Muskets re&s;t at once, the right Thumbs be|ing upon their Cocks, and the right Fingers
<PB N="13" REF="9"> behind their Triggers, then clo&s;ing to the Thighs half bend, with your right hands placed behind the Lock, keeping them re&s;t|ed with fingers extended.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>Clean your Pan.</HI></P>
<P>This you may do by pre&s;&s;ing the ball of your Thumb into the Pan, holding the right hand behind the Lock, that the po&s;ture may the better appear.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>Handle your Primer.</HI></P>
<P>In doing this, take the little end between your Thumb and Finger, turning the great end to the back of your Hand, your Arm bearing backward.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>Prime.</HI></P>
<P>Upon priming, level your Piece exactly upon a Line, and having Powder a little brui&s;ed, &s;trike it into the Pan as much as is convenient, the left Toe being kept upon the Front.</P>
<P N="13">13. <HI>Shut your Pan.</HI></P>
<P>Here u&s;e your two fir&s;t Fingers, ca&s;ting your Primer back, and drawing up your right Heel to your left In&s;tep, your Musket &s;treight up before you Recover, with the Barrel to|wards you, done with a quick Motion, the Thumb of your right hand on the top of the Steel, and the left hand as high as your Mouth.</P>
<P N="14"><PB N="14" REF="10">14. <HI>Blow off your loo&s;e Corns.</HI></P>
<P>In this ca&s;e, bring your Pan within four Inches of your Mouth, and blow with a &s;trong bla&s;t, ob&s;erving to do it altogether, &s;tanding upright without declining the Head, ca&s;ting out your Arms, and &s;uffering your Piece to &s;ink from the po&s;ture it before was in.</P>

<P>THE Drum has been very anciently u&s;ed in War, and always approved by the greate&s;t Captains; the Souldiers under&s;tand|ing thereby, what they are to do in many points, as well as by the voice of their Com|mander, and therefore it is called &s;eme-vocal, and gives directions of &s;undry kinds in the&s;e &s;ix points of War more peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;h|ed, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Call.</HI> 2. The <HI>Troop.</HI> 3. The <HI>March.</HI> 4. The <HI>Preparative.</HI> 5. The <HI>Bat|taile.</HI> 6. The <HI>Retreat.</HI> And of the&s;e in their Order.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Call</HI> is to bring the Souldiers toge|ther to their Arms upon deliberate or urgent occa&s;ions, or to hear any Proclamation or Orders that are to be given by the Officers; &s;o the Souldiers ought not, e&s;pecially in time of War, on great Penalties, to ramble be|yond the hearing of it, unle&s;s they be &s;ent upon Parties, or by &s;ome Expre&s;s, with the Knowledge and Approbation of the General or Officer in Chief.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Troop</HI> being beat, the Souldiers mu&s;t incontinently &s;houlder their Muskets,
<PB N="42" REF="24"> and Advance their Pikes, clo&s;ing their Ranks and Files to Order, following their Officers to the place of Randesvoze, or el&s;e where.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>March</HI> beaten, you mu&s;t ob&s;erve to take your open Order in Rank, &s;houlder both Musket and Pike, and march quicker, or &s;lower, as the Drum beats.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Preparative</HI> is to warn you, that you clo&s;e your due di&s;tance in preparing for Battle, or Skirmi&s;h, and &s;ee that nothing be out of Order that may turn to your Advan|tage or Hindrance, for a Battle &s;eldom &s;uc|ceeds well where the Order is not ob&s;erved with the greate&s;t Exactne&s;s.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Battle</HI> is that which is u&s;ually called the Charge or Signal, to Charge the Enemy; &s;o that upon this the Souldier mu&s;t rai&s;e his Spirit to the highe&s;t pitch of Fury, though with caution, for Valour and Prudence ought to go hand in hand, if you would attain to things noble and great.</P>
<P N="6">6.

<P>There are of late other things &s;ignified by the Drum, as the manner of Exerci&s;e, but it being mo&s;tly according to Humour, the Drum-Majors ought to give it to every File-leader in writing, that &s;o he may be able to direct his File by his Example, what they are to do till the Souldiers are perfect in it, and the rea&s;on why we &s;o direct is, becau&s;e it is variable, and not &s;o &s;ub&s;tantial as the word of Command.</P>

<P>THo&s;e Officers that take place in a Garri&s;on are u&s;ually a Governour, a Lieutenant Governour, a Major, Aid-Major, and Cap|tains of the Gates.</P>
<P>The Governour above others is obliged in this ca&s;e to have a care of the Place, and &s;ee that there be no wrong done to the Inha|bitants, and furthermore he is to appoint the Guard Rounds, and Patrolls, to give the Word each Evening, vi&s;it the Po&s;ts, keep the Officers and Soldiers in &s;uch Order that

<P>The Major's Care is to &s;ee the Guards mounted, the Po&s;ts and Rounds a&s;&s;igned, he Orders the Sentinels, and goes every Eve|ning to receive the Word from the Gover|nour, giving it about to the Quarter-Ma&s;ter and Serjeants upon the Place of Arms, and likewi&s;e goes his Rounds; the Major al&s;o vi&s;its the Corps of Guards, and ob&s;erves that the Soldier's Arms are well placed, and in good Order, ordering the nece&s;&s;ary Ammuni|tion to be di&s;tributed among&s;t them, he takes care of the Gates being &s;hut and opened, and is accountable to the Governour of what pa&s;&s;es, and gives him a Relation thereof, and indeed the Officers that are in Gari&s;on are to be obedient to the Governour or Commander in chief, and not to &s;tir thence, without leave in Writing.</P>
<P>The Captains of the Gate are to go mor|ning and evening to the Governour's Hou&s;e to receive the Keys, that they may open and &s;hut them, and frequently there is in the Ga|ri&s;on, if it be in a Frontire-Town more e|&s;pecially, a Commi&s;&s;ary of the Artillery or Store keeper, who&s;e care it is to keep a

<HEAD>Directions for Shooting at Random, or at a Mark.</HEAD>
<P>IF your bu&s;ine&s;s lies to &s;hoot at Random, or at a Mark, then you are to con&s;ider the Random of a Piece is its entire di&s;tance from the place where you di&s;charge, to the place where the Bullet fir&s;t lights or grazes o a level Line, called a Horizential plain, and to gain the true knowledge of this, the ground mu&s;t be level where it is put in practice, &s;o that the level of the &s;hot may not be hindred, and having taken notice of the di&s;tance of ground from the Piece to the fall of the Bullet, mount the Muzzle a degree higher, ob&s;erving again the &s;ame notice, by which through many degrees you will be capable of knowing, upon the level or A&s;cendant, how many paces the Piece will carry with more or le&s;s Powder, which may be rai&s;ed even to a tenth degree, or as high as the Piece can be mounted, &s;o the&s;e di&s;tances well under&s;tood, the Gunner may know how to direct his Piece
<PB N="150" REF="79"> either at a Ba&s;tion, Ca&s;tle-Wall, Curtain, Ravelin Counter&s;carp again&s;t the Batteries of Be&s;iegers, or into their Trenches, or he may batter the Ranks of an Army at a great di|&s;tance, and many other things incident to true Rules of Fireing even to the &s;triking a Ship under Sail, but in fireing at any thing in Motion, you mu&s;t con&s;ider the &s;wiftne&s;s of it, and Fire in your aim a di&s;tance before, and &s;o the Bullet by that it moves that &s;pace will be there, for although a Bullet is carried with great impetuo&s;ity, yet all Motions require time more or le&s;s.</P>
<P>If you would &s;trike down a Light in the Stern of a Ship, or in a Ca&s;tle if it be in the Night time, you mu&s;t &s;tick directly on the top of the Muzzle of your Piece, either a peice of Wax-Candle lighted, or a fired Match, by which means you will bring that and the other Light together, &s;o as to take a fair Mark, and to know whether they are brought together, &s;tick up a Nail with a peice of Wax or Clay on the breach of the Pice, and bring that and the other two to bear with each other.</P>

<HEAD>How to take out a Shot that sticks in a Piece, and cool her to make her recover her Force.</HEAD>
<P>IT many times happens through too much ha&s;tine&s;s, or that a Shot is mi&s;taken, or that the Powder, for want of being rammed down, makes it &s;tick half way, &s;o that it is dangerous to di&s;charge it, without breaking the Piece; in this Ca&s;e let it de&s;cend, low|ering its Muzzle, and then having di&s;&s;olved Bay Salt, or other Salt, in &s;ome Vinegar put it into the Touch-hole with a Funnel, and it will di&s;&s;olve the Powder; then &s;trike on the Piece with a Hand-&s;pike where the Bullet lyes, and it will rowl out, having be|fore given it a thru&s;t or two with the Ram|mer to loo&s;en it.</P>
<P>It is taken notice on by all Gunners that the oftner a Piece is di&s;charged, it by grow|ing hot, loo&s;es more, and of it's force, and will not carry the third or fourth time &s;o far as it will the fir&s;t or &s;econd, every time aba|ting &s;omewhat, &s;o that you mu&s;t cool it, which is much the better done with Vinegar; for that not only carries off the heat, but by the &s;harpne&s;s of it's Quality recovers the lo&s;t force.</P>
