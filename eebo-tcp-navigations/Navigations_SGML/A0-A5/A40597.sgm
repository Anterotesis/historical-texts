<HEAD>A Full and True RELATION OF THE Remarkable Fight BETWIXT Capt. HAMILTON and Capt. BROWN, Commanders of the Two <HI>Scotch</HI> FRIGATS, AND Three <HI>French</HI> Men of WAR, <HI>That brought over the</HI> IRISH <HI>Men to Joyn</HI> Dundee <HI>in the</HI> We&s;tern <HI>Sea, as it was delivered to &s;ome of the Privy Coun&s;ellors in</HI> Scotland, <HI>by tho&s;e that were Eye Witne&s;&s;es during the whole Action.</HI> LICENSED <HI>Aug. 2. 1689. J. Fra&s;er.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN regard that the Bravery and Gallantne&s;s of the la&s;t Actions of Captain <HI>Hamilton</HI> and Captain <HI>Brown's</HI> Lives are &s;o Remar|kable, and not frequently paralell'd, I think it not ami&s;s to give you a particular and di&s;tinct Account of them, as it was deli|vered to &s;ome Members of the Privy-Council here, by one of the Lieutenants of tho&s;e Frigats that had the good Fortune to come off after he had been taken Pri&s;oner, and by other per&s;ons now in Town, who were pre&s;ent, and Witne&s;&s;es of what pa&s;t, which was thus. On <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the <HI>10th.</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> Captain <HI>Ha|milton</HI> Commanding the <HI>Pelican</HI> carrying 18 Guns and 120 Men, and Captain <HI>Brown</HI> in the <HI>Jennet</HI> Frigate carrying 12 Guns and 80 Men, as they were Crui&s;ing between the Mull of <HI>Kintire</HI> in <HI>Scot|land</HI> and <HI>Carrich&s;ergus Lough</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> happened to di&s;cover at Sea to the Southward three Sail of Ships, to whom they immedi|ately ply'd up, and when they came within &s;uch a di&s;tance as to be able to di&s;cern them; they ob&s;erved them to look like En|gli&s;h built Ships, carrying the Engli&s;h Flag and Colours, which led them into the mi&s;take of believing them to be Engli&s;h and Friends: This obliged them to make up clo&s;e to them to Salute them; but they did not &s;ooner perceive their Errour, than they
<PB REF="2"> found it impo&s;&s;ible to Retreat; they being three French Men of War, having on Aboard a Battalion of 400 Men of Collonel <HI>Por|&s;ils</HI> Regiment of Foot, that was going to joyn <HI>Dundee;</HI> the big|ge&s;t of them carrying 36 Guns, the Second 30, and the third 24 Guns: And &s;o to Action they fell immediately, and fought it with all the Gallantry and Re&s;olution imaginable with their Guns above an hour; the two le&s;&s;er Frigats fell to Captain <HI>Brown</HI>'s &s;hare to engage with, and when his Main Ma&s;t was &s;hot down, they came and lay aboard him, in which Action his Right Arm was &s;hot off with a Canon Bullet, yet notwith&s;tanding he maintained the Fight Re&s;olutely, and continued giving directions and Orders to his Men, untill he received &s;even Musket Bullets in his Body, the la&s;t of which killed him dead, one <HI>Cambell</HI> his Lieutenant maintain'd the Fight with the &s;ame Gallantry, until be|ing over power'd by the Enemies men, who after great &s;laughters coming on board found the Lieutenant lying on the Deck, Shot throught the right Thigh, the right Shoulder, and left Arm, hav|ing only 14 Men alive, whereof 8 were wounded and di&s;abled. Captain <HI>Brown</HI>'s Ship being thus taken, the&s;e two Frigats Joyn the great one, and all three fall on Captain <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who made his part good again&s;t the French Man alone, and when his Ship had been much batter'd and torn, the two bigge&s;t Ships came and en|deavoured to board him; and with them he fought a con&s;iderable time, his Ship being better provided for a clo&s;e Fight then Cap|tain <HI>Brown's</HI> was, he had the misfortune to be thrice boarded by the Enemy, and the Courage to clear his Deck as often of them. At la&s;t his Foreca&s;tle and Steerage being torn open by the violence and frequency of the Enemies Shot, and the hand gra|nadoes doing much mi&s;chief to his Men, the Enemy boarded him the fourth time in great Numbers, &s;o that looking upon him&s;elf and his Ship for lo&s;t, as his la&s;t affort, gave orders to his Gunner to go down to the hold and blow up the Ship; and he no &s;ooner gave the word of Command for Executing what he had purpo&s;ed to do, but a Cannon Bullet at random Shot from the third Ship, came and di&s;patcht him, and hindred his la&s;t orders from being obey'd. And &s;o his Ship fell into the Enemies hands, and of the 120 Men he had on board, only 30 Men were found alive, whereof the greate&s;t part were wounded and much di&s;abled. In this Action there were killed of our People, the two Captains, one hundred and fifty Six Men; and of the Enemies one French Captain, two Lieutenants, two hundred and Eighteen Men, and many wounded.</P>
<P>This Account we have from &s;ome that were taken and now have made their E&s;cape, and from tho&s;e that have been aboard the French Ship &s;ince the Action, as al&s;o from &s;ome of tho&s;e Iri&s;h that were taken pri&s;oners &s;ince that time, all their Relations agreeing as above is mentioned.</P>
