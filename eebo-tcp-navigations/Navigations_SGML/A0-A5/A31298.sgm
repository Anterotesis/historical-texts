<HEAD>TO THE Ingenious Reader, THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE de&s;ire of Travel, and Voyag|ing to di&s;tant Lands, is &s;o Natu|ral to an Active Genious, that but few who have not had the opportunity of put|ting it in Action, have been no le&s;s de|&s;irable of &s;uch an improving undertaking. By what is vi&s;ible in one's Native Coun|try, there is no exalted Mind but mu&s;t con&s;equently tend to a higher elevation in Knowledge, to furni&s;h it with a Comple|tion of tho&s;e wonderful things the &s;canty Globe Communicates to the Sight and Sen&s;es, &s;o to enable one to give a true Judgment in difference of Countries, and
<PB REF="3"> what is Rare and Remarkable in them. To this end, Princes have laid a&s;ide their Regal Ornaments, and the exube|rant Plea&s;ures of Thrones for a time, taking on them the Fateigue of long Jour|neys, through many dangers and difficul|ties, that &s;o they might inform them&s;elves of the certainty of things, and Affairs worthy to be entertained in the repo&s;ito|ries of Royal Brea&s;ts, and to be the con|cern of Maje&s;ty. I need not enumerate Ancient Examples for this, one very Modern may &s;uffice, to evidence Truth of what I Atte&s;t. It is well known how the Great and Powerful Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> in the mid&s;t of War &s;hroud|ing Maje&s;ty in a mean di&s;gui&s;e; left his Spacious Country and Armies Conte&s;ting with the mighty Nations of <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Tartars,</HI> making a tedious Journey to inform him&s;elf in tho&s;e Matters; of which, at Home, he conceived he had but an imperfect Relation; al&s;o to polli&s;h his pregnant Genious in the refined Courts of other Princes, and in all probability
<PB REF="3"> met with a &s;atisfaction that made him conclude his Time and Travel well be|&s;towed and undertaken.</P>
<P>I need not much enforce an Argument to per&s;wade the Ingenious that Travel, renders a Man very much accompli&s;hed, and often rai&s;es his Fortune above the common level. It has been &s;een in An|cient and Modern Ages, whil&s;t &s;uch as have &s;upinely loytered away their Mo|ments of Life, under the umbrage of their own Man&s;ion, have made no fi|gure in the World, whil&s;t they remained in it; and when they dropt from the &s;tage of Mortality were &s;oon wrapped in Oblivion. But to come &s;omewhat nearer to my purpo&s;e;</P>
<P>In this Hi&s;tory of my Travels through many va&s;t Countries, I have been very exact to &s;et down nothing but what with much Care and Circum&s;pection occurrred to me; where any thing is mentioned, as by Hear-&s;ay, which is but &s;canty. I
<PB REF="4"> had it in Conver&s;ing with tho&s;e know|ing, and, as I nearly conclude, of much In|tegrity, every thing bearing a probability and con&s;onance to Truth. The whole Work is free from Impo&s;&s;ibilities, or any thing that may carry the face of Ro|mantick Stories or Fables, you may ea&s;i|ly perceive in Reading, where I was an occular and aureal Witne&s;s, and where I had only informations from others, which contribute but a very little part of what I have Written. I have as much as po&s;&s;ible affected Brevity, and mu&s;t pre|&s;ume to &s;ay, that none who have gone be|fore me, have in Large Volumes comprized &s;o much material matter. I Writ it in|deed at fir&s;t for the refre&s;hing my own memory, but my Friends, who on all oc|ca&s;ions had been Dear to me, were im|patient that it &s;hould rest in Silence, and &s;wayed me even again&s;t my inclinations, to let it go abroad; (for not without &s;ome Reluctancy) I &s;ubmitted to their importu|nities, and the many rea&s;ons they urged to Frame or Mould me to a temper of com|plying.
<PB REF="4"> And now it is abroad, I am al|together per&s;waded, it cannot but be grate|full to my ingenious Countrymen, nay, e|ven to Neighbouring Nations; for &s;ome|thing con&s;trains me to imagin, it will not altogether be confined within the narrow compa&s;s of a &s;ingle I&s;land, when it con|tains in it &s;elf &s;o great a &s;hare of the World, and all that is worthy of Note in the Countries it mentions, and tho&s;e the mo&s;t Famed in the Univer&s;e. I have di|ge&s;ted it into a Method &s;uitable for the un|der&s;tanding of all intelligent Capacities, and formed it in Chapters, that any thing de&s;ired may be the &s;ooner found out, or turn'd to; yet the Contents mention not the Par|ticulars at full, but only &s;ome as an In|troduction to the re&s;t; for the matter being Conci&s;e and Compact, &s;hould I bring every thing under the heads mentioned there|in, they would &s;well too much, and per|haps be tedious to the Reader, &s;eeing &s;uch a method is a kind of doubling what is the &s;ub&s;equent, and an Anticipateing the the Readers Expectation.</P>
<PB REF="5">
<P> To Conclude, I pre&s;ent you with Truth and Variety, and &s;o re&s;ting on the in|genious Reader's good Nature, and Im|partiality for a candid Con&s;truction of this Work, I take leave to &s;ub&s;cribe my &s;elf,</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Motives that induced the Author to under|take the&s;e Travels; his fir&s;t &s;etting out for</HI> Con&s;tantinople, <HI>and Voyage as far as the</HI> Dardanelles; <HI>the de&s;cription of divers places he touched at in the way, and what el&s;e happened in that pa&s;&s;age.</HI></HEAD>
<P>INSPIRED by the Fame of di&s;tant Lands, by &s;eeing what's rare and Worthy of Note nearer Home, I debated with my &s;elf whether the latter ought not to &s;uffice my curio&s;ity, and laboured very much to enforce it for ma|ny Rea&s;ons; but neither that, nor the Charge, Dan|ger, and Hard&s;hips I was like to meet with in Voy|aging tempe&s;tuous Seas, nor Travelling &s;trange
<PB N="2" REF="6"> Countries, had any &s;uch prevalent Effect upon me as to &s;urmount the eager Inclination and re&s;tle&s;s De&s;ire I had to be an Eye-witne&s;s of tho&s;e things I had often heard, though imperfectly, in Relation to what they have &s;ince appear'd. This great Re|&s;olve labouring in my Mind, my Friends could not chu&s;e but take notice of &s;ome great alteration in me, and their pre&s;&s;ing de&s;ires to know the cau&s;e of unu&s;ual Emotions that were too evident, con&s;train'd me to open my &s;elf freely, which at fir&s;t did not a little &s;tartle them; but perceiving I was fully bent on the undertaking, and that all their per&s;wa&s;ions to the contrary were fruitle&s;s, they a&s;&s;i&s;ted me with a &s;upply in a great mea&s;ure to carry on my under|taking; and &s;o having prepared every thing I then thought nece&s;&s;ary, we parted with good Wi&s;hes, Prayers and Tears.</P>
<P>I &s;ent my Cargo on Board a Merchant's Ship lying over-again&s;t <HI>Eriffe,</HI> in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> on the 30th of <HI>April</HI> 1684, and travelling over-land, went on Board my&s;elf when &s;he was fallen to the <HI>Downs.</HI> It will be needle&s;s to tell you what Agree|ment I made with the Ma&s;ter who was my Friend, and u&s;ed me extream well during my Voyage, or how I &s;pent my time e'er we quitted the Lands end; let it &s;uffice we were driven back by &s;tre&s;s of Wea|ther, and forced to put in at &s;everal places with o|ther Ships in our Company, before we had a fair Wind to carry us out to Sea; but at length Provi|dence &s;o ordered it, that the Wind came about as well as we could wi&s;h, and we lo&s;t no time to em|brace &s;o favourable an opportunity; but getting out of Harbour, where we had lain for Ten days Wind bound, in a few hours &s;ailing <HI>England</HI> di&s;appeared, but Night coming on, the Sun &s;etting with a dusky Cloud a thwart it, and darting its Beams Pale to either Pole, the Mariners ob&s;erved by that and &s;ome other Signs they have, that a Storm threatned us; nor were they deceived in their Conjecture, for the Wind aro&s;e by degrees, and about Mid|night it was a full Storm, but with &s;ome difficulty
<PB N="3" REF="6"> we weather'd it, for about the ri&s;ing of the Sun the Wind &s;lackned and we kept on our way; yet this to&s;sing a little indi&s;po&s;ed me, &s;o that all that day I kept my Cabin, but for the mo&s;t part after this the Seas and Winds contended as it were to give us a favourable pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> whither this Ship was bound upon &s;ome particular occa&s;ions as well as that of Trade, which I do not conceive pertinent to this Relation of my own Travels, nor &s;hall I de&s;cribe, as &s;ome &s;uperfluou&s;ly do, all the Coa&s;ts we made in our Sailing: Let it &s;uffice then that we touched not till we came to <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> in <HI>Sicily,</HI> though in our pa&s;&s;age I &s;aw the Fires of the Moun|tain <HI>Stromboli,</HI> which in the night time looked dreadful, though at a great di&s;tance, and was in|formed that the People who live near it conceive a fooli&s;h opinion, that it is an entrance into Hell, becau&s;e when the Fire makes its Irruptions they hear howlings as of the Damned, which is no more than the Winds breaking through the hollow Rockey Caverns in the Mountain, wa&s;ted by the long continuance of the burning, which makes a confu&s;ed noi&s;e, that at a di&s;tance re&s;embles howling.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing the Fare of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> we came before the Town, and dropt Anchor without the Port, where tho&s;e that would had leave to go a-&s;hore; I failed not to do it, and whil&s;t the Sailers were employed in taking in &s;ome nece&s;&s;aries, I took a &s;light view of the place. It lies on that &s;ide the I&s;land that looks to <HI>Rhegio</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> from which it is 60 miles di&s;tant, where the Ancient Town of <HI>Zande</HI> &s;tood: Nature has furni&s;hed it with a plea&s;ant and &s;afe Harbour, which for its compactne&s;s may be thought to have been made by Art. The Buildings that adorn the Port are Regular and Uniform, &s;o that they give a plea&s;ant pro&s;pect at the end of the Mole that &s;huts in the Port: There is a Tower well fortified to &s;ecure the entry, and about the middle of it is another Tower, on the top of it a a great Light to guide Ships in the Night; The Streets of the Town are fair and large; The Cathe|dral
<PB N="4" REF="7"> is very &s;tately, and over the Door in large Characters is Written, <HI>Gran-Mercy a Me&s;&s;ine.</HI> When the <HI>French</HI> became Ma&s;ters of the I&s;land, it was the fir&s;t place that Surrendered, and <HI>Sicily</HI> cau&s;ed and beheld the fatal Tragedy of the Intruders, for a de&s;ign was &s;ecretly laid and carried on, &s;o that on a &s;et day, when the Bell rung to Evening Song, which was the Sign, the Inhabitants of the I&s;land Ma&s;&s;acred all the French Nation without &s;paring Women or Children, which is &s;till called the Fatal <HI>Sicilian</HI> Ve&s;per. Before the Church is a &s;quare Piazza, with a Theatre in the middle, where the Victory o|ver the Turki&s;h Naval Forces is repre&s;ented in Bra&s;s, and in the &s;ame Metal &s;tands the Statue of Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> the Spani&s;h Admiral, in that Expedition. The Country is very Fruitful, abounds in Sulphur Mines, and much &s;ubject to Earthquakes. The next Town of note is <HI>Syracu&s;e,</HI> where the famous <HI>Archimedes</HI> made his Experiments, and fired the <HI>Roman</HI> Navy that be&s;ieged it with Burning-Gla&s;&s;es. There is a Ca&s;tle built on the Rocks called <HI>Scyla,</HI> and the Water beating on the&s;e Rocks re&s;embles the barking of Dogs. As for <HI>Charibais</HI> it is oppo&s;ite to the Port of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> and not dangerous, but when two contrary Eddies meet and make a kind of a whirlpool, &s;o that &s;ometimes Ships turn round and are &s;ucked in, which gave occa&s;ion to Fable them two Sea Mon&s;ters &s;et there to de&s;troy Pa&s;&s;en|gers, though there are Pilots always ready at the general Charge to guide Ships in and out. The Viceroy has his Re&s;idence here &s;ix Months, and as many at <HI>Palermo. Mount Gibello,</HI> anciently called <HI>Aetna,</HI> much infects this fruitful I&s;land with its firey Irruptions. The Sicilians are very hauty, Proud, and exceeding Jealous of the Spaniards under who&s;e Government they are.</P>
<P>From hence &s;etting Sail, we directed our Cour&s;e to <HI>Maltha,</HI> and having Coa&s;ted <HI>Sicily,</HI> there &s;prung up an Ea&s;t North Ea&s;t Wind, before which we drove a very &s;wift Sailing, and &s;oon made the I&s;le of <HI>Mal|tha,</HI> in the Port of which we came to an Anchor.
<PB N="5" REF="7"> It lies in the <HI>African</HI> Sea, between <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Tripoly,</HI> in the Latitude of 38 degrees, and in Longitude 34, extending from Ea&s;t to We&s;t 29 Miles, and is about 12 over; all the Earth is exceeding White; its Ancient Name was <HI>Melita.</HI> In the Year 1530 the Emperor <HI>Charles</HI> gave it, and the I&s;le of <HI>Gozo,</HI> to the Knights who were driven out of <HI>Rhodes,</HI> and they have ever &s;ince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it in &s;pite of all the efforts the Turks have made. It &s;eems to be a Rock with very little Earth on it, yet it bears Fruit and Corn, but they are mo&s;tly &s;upplied from <HI>Sicily,</HI> it lying but 20 Leagues di&s;tant. Here St. Paul on his landing in his pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Rome</HI> &s;hook off the Viper; they &s;how his Grott, and the Earth is dug there, and carried away for many Phy&s;ical u&s;es. The Natives wear Green Spectacles to pre|vent their Eyes from Dazling, by rea&s;on of the whitene&s;s of the Earth. The Knights of the Order are under a great Ma&s;ter. They have many advantageous Ports well defended, and are formi|dable at Sea with their Galleys to the Moors of Barbary and Turks; for if they take them they make 'em Slaves. The Towns of <HI>Maltha</HI> are well &s;cituate and defended; they have good Magazines, and always keep a good Provi&s;ion of Arms and Na|val Stores. They are very charitable to Travel|lers, e&s;pecially the Sick, providing for them in their Ho&s;pitals while they &s;tay, and pay the charges of their Voyage when they depart.</P>
<P>The Wind being again fair, we left <HI>Maltha,</HI> pa&s;|&s;ing the Cape of <HI>Metapan</HI> and I&s;le of <HI>Cerigo,</HI> the Ancient Porphyrus and Citherea, where former|ly &s;tood a Magnificent Temple to <HI>Venus,</HI> the ruins of which, as I was told, are &s;till to be &s;een near the Sea; and meeting with a &s;torm, we were con&s;train|ed to ca&s;t Anchor before the I&s;land of <HI>Zia,</HI> which in Ancient times was called <HI>Calle Ceos</HI> or <HI>Cea;</HI> it is a|bout 50 Miles in Circuit, &s;haped like a Hor&s;e-&s;hoe; the Soil produces Wine, Corn, good Pa&s;ture, and many other u&s;eful things; the Harbour is &s;tored with Fi&s;h, the Inhabitants are very civil to Stran|gers;
<PB N="6" REF="8"> the Women wear their Coats but to their Knees, and their Smocks about a Foot below that, with a Veil reaching their Brea&s;ts, which they turn a&s;ide as they think fit; when they will or will not Compliment any but lying in War's way, be|tween the Turks and Venetians, they are much op|pre&s;&s;ed and impoveri&s;hed, otherways the plenty of the I&s;land would inrich them.</P>
<P>Sailing from hence we made the I&s;le of <HI>Andra:</HI> This is the Ancient <HI>Andros</HI> of the Greeks, but now Inhabited by People of &s;everal Nations, as <HI>Albani|ans, Armenians, Turks, Jews, &amp;c.</HI> and the&s;e differ in Cu&s;toms as well as Languages, very rude and unho&s;pitable; the Chief Towns are <HI>Arni</HI> and <HI>Amo|lacos.</HI> The Greeks have &s;everal Churches in this I&s;land, but the People are very Super&s;titious and odd in their Devotions, &s;trowing Flowers, and rowling in them; but the Latins who have likewi&s;e Churches there, are more Civilized, and proceed Regular: The I&s;land is very Fruitful, and here they make abundance of white wicker Baskets u&s;ed all over the <HI>Archipelago.</HI></P>
<P>Weighing Anchor, we got out to Sea, and &s;tood to the Starboard, pa&s;&s;ing between this I&s;land and <HI>Negropont,</HI> and having a South-we&s;t Wind, <HI>Sciro,</HI> and &s;oon after <HI>I&s;pi Cera,</HI> and &s;ome other places ap|peared. In the Evening when we were pretty clear of I&s;lands, the Wind turned Ea&s;t South Ea&s;t, and we &s;oon made the Land where <HI>Troy</HI> &s;tood, lit|tle of who&s;e Ruins remain; for we had pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Te|nedos</HI> in the Night, &s;o pa&s;&s;ing the Mouths we en|tered the Channel of the <HI>Hele&s;pont,</HI> the place where the Turks pa&s;&s;ed from <HI>A&s;ia</HI> into <HI>Europe</HI> to extend their Empire.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="7" REF="8">
<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of the</HI> Hele&s;pont, Dardanelles, <HI>Places a|bout them, what is ob&s;ervable in</HI> Con|&s;tantinople <HI>and its adjacents; Containing all that is Curious and Remarkable in the&s;e Parts.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Gate, or Entrance, as it were, to <HI>Con&s;tan|tinople</HI> being by the <HI>Hele&s;pont</HI> and <HI>Dardanelles,</HI> I think it here convenient to &s;ay &s;omething of this fam'd Streight before I come a Land; It lies in 37 Degrees, 42 Minutes, North Latitude, and of Lon|gitude about 55, not extending above 10 or 12 Leagues in length, and at the entrance it is a large League and an half broad; it divides the Country of <HI>Thrace</HI> from <HI>Troas</HI> a Province of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> that lies to the Ea&s;t: To the North lies the <HI>Propontis,</HI> and to the South the <HI>Aegean</HI> Sea, and the <HI>Archipelago;</HI> and in Sailing here one has a pro&s;pect of divers fine Towns, Villages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and a curious Country on either Hand.</P>
<P>The Turks knowing the important advantage of this Streight, have Fortified the Pa&s;&s;age with two &s;trong Ca&s;tles, one in <HI>Europe,</HI> and the other in <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> the Ca&s;tle built in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> called the <HI>New Ca&s;tle,</HI> is &s;eated on a tongue of Land pointing out into the Sea on a &s;quare Platform, comprizing 4 large panes of Walls, flanked at the four Corners with Towers; tho&s;e next the Sea, &s;quare with a &s;ort of Redoubt only on one &s;ide; tho&s;e toward the Land are round, and defend the Walls, but neither in thickne&s;s nor largene&s;s comparable to the other; the Works wa&s;h|ed by the Sea have Port-holes level with the &s;urface of the Water, and I could number as I Sailed by,
<PB N="8" REF="9"> about 40 Cannon mounted, to prevent any Ships from forcing their way into the Harbour; and to the South of this Ca&s;tle &s;tands a very fair Mo&s;que.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle on the European &s;ide, which the Turks call <HI>Roumeli-inglu-i&s;&s;ar,</HI> is &s;eated near to Cape <HI>Greco,</HI> and in form is irregular; within the compa&s;s of the Walls are Hou&s;es for the Aga, and other Of|ficers, with a fair Mo&s;que. There is a Platform on which many great Guns are planted, lying equal with the &s;urface of the Water. Near the Ca|&s;tle lies a &s;mall Village noted for its Five &s;tately Pila&s;ters, that &s;erve to underprop the Aquaducts bringing Water to the Fortre&s;s. But notwith&s;tand-the&s;e Ca&s;tles, who&s;e Guns reach from Shore to Shore, the Venetians, and other Maritime Nations, have in&s;ulted the Harbour, for the Ca&s;tles lie not directly oppo&s;ite, lea&s;t in firing they &s;hould batter each other. The Ca&s;tles are appointed to examine Ships that pa&s;s and re-pa&s;s, and the Governors have Orders to &s;ink &s;uch Ships as will not comply: Beyond the&s;e Ca&s;tles that are of Modern building are two old Ca&s;tles, one on each &s;hore; that on the A&s;ian &s;ide the Turks call <HI>Natoli-jski-j&s;iar;</HI> it is of &s;quare Building, flanked at the corners with Towers, and in the mid&s;t of it is a large &s;quare Tower, on which &s;ome Culverin is placed; and behind this Ca&s;tle is a large Village of about 3000 Inhabitants, Chri&s;tians, Turks, and Jews; The&s;e by us are called the Ca&s;tles of the <HI>Dardanelles.</HI> That on the European &s;ide is of a Regular Fortifi|cation, and indeed we may e&s;teem this narrow Pa&s;|&s;age well guarded by the&s;e Ca&s;tles, and <HI>Con&s;tantino|ple</HI> &s;o advantageou&s;ly Scituated, that no great City in the World can boa&s;t of more Advantages; as will by and by appear.</P>
<P>Being examined at the Ca&s;tles, and leave obtained to pa&s;s, we arrived at <HI>Gallipoly,</HI> about 35 Miles from them. This Town was anciently built by one <HI>Callias,</HI> Prince of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> and after his Name called <HI>Callipolis,</HI> but now corruptly <HI>Gallipoly;</HI> it is thinly inhabited by Greeks, who mo&s;tly &s;ell a

<P>After having been a-&s;hore, and pretty well re|fre&s;hed in this place, we weighed Anchor, and with a We&s;t South We&s;t Wind pa&s;&s;ed the I&s;le of <HI>Marmora:</HI> At this place the Sea is wide, and this is pro|perly the <HI>Propontis,</HI> though now called mo&s;tly <HI>Mare de Marmora;</HI> and here though we had a fair Wind, the Current &s;etting &s;trong again&s;t us, we could not make much way; however, Sailing on we in a little time came in &s;ight of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> which is about 125 Miles from <HI>Gallipoly,</HI> and enter|ing into the Streight of it we had a very fine Pro&s;pect of that Famous City; it is &s;eated in <HI>Thrace,</HI> on <HI>Europe</HI> &s;ide, over-again&s;t the Scituation of Ancient <HI>Chalcedon</HI> on the A&s;ian Shore.</P>

<P>Between the&s;e Seas is the entry of the Port, which Nature without the help of Art has made exceeding u&s;eful, for it is always &s;o replenni&s;hed with Water, that Ships of good burthen may lay their heads on the Keys, and one may &s;tep a-&s;hore without any difficulty.</P>
<P>It is held to be fir&s;t Founded by <HI>Pau&s;anias,</HI> King of <HI>Sparto,</HI> who named it <HI>Byzantium;</HI> and upon his con&s;ulting the Oracle where to build a City, he gave no other An&s;wer but this, <HI>viz.</HI> Over-again&s;t the blind Men, intimating the <HI>Calcidonians,</HI> who had neglected the fair opportunity of a &s;ight &s;o ac|commodated by Nature, and built <HI>Chalcedon</HI> in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> oppo&s;ite to it. It was de&s;troyed by <HI>Severus,</HI> to pu|ni&s;h the Citizens for their Revolt, but re&s;tored more Magnificent by <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great, who named it <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> equalling it with <HI>Rome</HI> in her Ancient Glory, and removing the Seat of the Empire thither, as if it were de&s;igned by the Na|ture of its Scituation, to bear Rule, and be the Mi&s;tri&s;s of Cities. There goes a Fame, that when <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> was about to mea&s;ure out ground to build an Imperial City in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> a &s;tooping Eagle catched up the Line, and carrying it over the Streight, dropt it in the place where the City now &s;tands, which was looked on as a fortunate Pre&s;age, and prov'd a &s;ufficient encouragement for erecting it. It was once taken by the <HI>Latins</HI> from the <HI>Greeks, Anno</HI> 1203, and re-taken by them <HI>Anno</HI> 1254; and la&s;t|ly by <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Second Emperour of the Turks, <HI>Anno</HI> 1453, who &s;ince made it the Seat of the Em|pire, and called it <HI>I&s;tambol,</HI> corruptly from the Greek Word <GAP DESC="foreign">. The heat of the Air in Summer is cool, and much allayed by the Bree|zes that come from the Seas. It has been much &s;ubject to Earthquakes, and is very often &s;o to the Plague.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="10">
<P> <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> is in Figure Triangular, two &s;ides of it are wa&s;hed by the Sea, the one by the Pro|pontis, or White Sea, and the other by the Port; the other &s;ide is towards the Land; the bigge&s;t of the three is that beaten by the Surges of the Pro|pontis, reaching from the Seraglio to the &s;even Towers, and that towards the Port is the middle|mo&s;t: The Seraglio being built on the point of the point of the Triangle, gives a curious Pro&s;pect, for it runs out between the Propontis and the Port: Its Gardens on the Shoar are very Charming, there being nothing that is &s;carce and rare but is found in them; and this is held to be the particular &s;pot where the Ancient <HI>Byzantium</HI> &s;tood. On the other Angle pointing to the Canal of the White Sea, are the &s;even Towers; they were built by the Chri|&s;tians, and are covered with Lead; the chief u&s;e they are now put to, is to keep the va&s;t Trea&s;ure of the Empire, &s;ent as Tribute from many Nations, though part of them are often made a Pri&s;on for Per&s;ons of Quality, and great Officers. At the third Angle which is at the bottom of the Port to the Land &s;ide, appear the Ruins of <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI>'s Pal|lace, by which it &s;eems to have been very Magni|ficent.</P>
<P>This great City is encompa&s;&s;ed by &s;trong Walls, and to the Land &s;ide they are double; in &s;ome places the Walls are of rough Stone and Brick, in others of Smooth Free&s;toone; they are guarded by a good Ditch, Wharfed and Faced on both &s;ides; the Walls are guarded by a great number of little Towers at an equal di&s;tance, and Guns planted commodiou&s;ly, though I confe&s;s, I take it not to be very &s;trong, compared with the Modern Forti|fied Towns and Cities: Some allow it to be 16 Miles in circuit, but I cannot well agree with them, for I, with another Per&s;on, walked and rowed it at a pretty moderate pace in three Hours, &s;o that I gue&s;s it to be about 12 Miles in Circuit. It has 22 Gates, 6 towards the Land, 5 towards the Pro|pontis, and 11 along the Port; tho&s;e to the Water
<PB N="12" REF="11"> an&s;wered by Creeks, Landing places and Stairs. When I had made this ob&s;ervation I thought it convenient to enter the City, which I did on the fifth of <HI>June</HI> about nine in the Morning, I found the Streets mo&s;tly narrow, the Hou&s;es generally built of Timber, and that is the rea&s;on when Fires happen, which they often do, va&s;t numbers of Hou&s;es are con&s;umed before the raging Element can be overcome, and the Jani&s;aries and others, ap|pointed to extingui&s;h it, many times on a di&s;gu&s;t, or for the &s;ake of Plunder, encourage the progre&s;s of the Conflagration by hindering tho&s;e that would a&s;&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P>Going to the Be&s;e&s;tn which is a di&s;tinct Canton of the City, enclo&s;ed with Gates and Walls, I found it to be very fine, for here the Merchants keep Shop, and the place is very Regular, the Hou&s;es are covered above with Planks joyned upon Rafters, though there are holes left to let in the Light; and here the riche&s;t Wares are vended, or at lea&s;t Samples to be &s;een of &s;uch as they have in their Warehou&s;es; They are all ranked by them&s;elves, &s;o that bu&s;ine&s;s is quickly di&s;patched. At ten every Evening the Gates are &s;hut, and after that hour none can pa&s;s without giving a &s;mall matter of Money to the Porter, and this is the place mo&s;t frequented; greate&s;t part of the Streets though the City are very Populous, being ea&s;ie to pa&s;s without Crouds at any time.</P>
<P>From this place I went to vi&s;it the Hypyodrome, which &s;pacious place was built by the Emperor <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> for Tilts, Tournaments, and other exerci&s;e on Hor&s;eback, and the Turks at pre&s;ent call it the place of Hor&s;es; It is 400 paces long, and about 200 broad; and at the end oppo&s;ite to the Seraglio, there are two Obilisks, the fir&s;t is 70 Foot high, and can be di&s;cerned to con&s;i&s;t of no more than one Stone; it is adorned with &s;everal Herogliphical Figures in Relief, placed on a &s;quare Marble Pede&s;tal; on one of the Faces of the Pe|de&s;tal is an old Latin In&s;cription &s;o defaced by
<PB N="13" REF="11"> time, that no more can be gathered from it, than that it was built by the Emperor <HI>Theodo&s;ius;</HI> the Se|cond has a like in Greek Characters; the Third is adorned with the Emperor's Effigies &s;eated on a Throne, with his Officers of State about him; and on the Fourth is repre&s;ented a Battle. The other Obelisk is of Free Stone, &s;harp pointed like a Pi|ramid, and being much worn by time, has no In|&s;cription on it to be di&s;cerned.</P>
<P>Near the&s;e &s;tands a Brazen Piller of con&s;iderable heighth, commonly called the Serpentine Column, becau&s;e it appears like three Serpents wreathed or twi&s;ted together, their Tails fa&s;tned to the ground, and at the top it has 3 gapeing Mouths; and it is the common opinion, that this Pillar was &s;et up in remembrance of 3 Serpents, who in Ancient times wa&s;ted the confines of the City, till the Emperor <HI>Leo Haurus</HI> by Magick Art drew them into a great Ditch in the middle of the Hypyodrome, who were killed by filling up the Ditch with Stones and Earth. In this City there are two other Columns, one cal|led the Hi&s;torical, and the other the Burnt Co|lumn, the latter being defaced by Fire, but nei|ther of them being much remarkable, I pa&s;s them over, yet adjoyning to them there is a Court where the Archers Exerci&s;e, and the Turks are very exact in &s;hooting, for I &s;ee them &s;tick their Arrows one after another in the circumference of half a Crown, at 100 Paces.</P>
<P>The next thing of Note my curio&s;ity led me to vi&s;it was, <HI>Sancta Sophia,</HI> the principal Mo&s;que in the City; it has &s;everal Doors that lead into a Por|tico that gives entrance into the Mo&s;que, which is 120 Paces in Length, and 80 in breadth, having &s;quare Walls, but the Vault or Roof is round, &s;o Artificially contrived, that the Frame is &s;upported without Columns, though there are many rows of Columns, which only appear to &s;upport the weight of two Galleries, yet are placed &s;o that they prove very Ornamental, being 30 on each &s;ide, about 16 Foot high, of hard polli&s;hed Stone; however, the
<PB N="14" REF="12"> length of Time has made many Clefts and Chinks in them. The Vault of the Mo&s;que retains much of its Ancient Beauty, as being adorned with cu|rious Mo&s;aick Work, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;mall guilt Stones &s;o neatly joyned, that they after &s;o many Ages re|main almo&s;t perfect; and at the four Corners where the Vault begins, in Mo&s;aick Work, are the Fi|gires of the four Bea&s;ts mentioned in the Apocalyps, yet Turks who pretend to abhor Images have &s;ome|what defaced them, as they have the Figure of our Saviour, which is over the Principal Door: He is repre&s;ented &s;itting on a Throne, giving Benedict-to one that pro&s;trates before him; the Figure of the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI> appears on the Right Hand; and in a Ba&s;s Relief the Holy Gho&s;t is repre&s;ented in the Figure of a Dove, which they have not at all de|faced.</P>
<P>There is to be &s;een the Tomb of the Renowned Emperor <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> in this &s;tately Structure, in for|mer times a Chri&s;tian Church; it is a Grey Stone, 8 Foot long, and 4 over, and the Turks hold it in remembrance of that worthy Emperor of great E&s;teem. This Mo&s;que or Temple is paved with curious Marble covered with Mats, to abate the coldne&s;s of the Stone when they pro&s;trate them|&s;elves, for the Turks are &s;o devoutly &s;uper&s;titious, that they put of their Barbouches, or Shooes, when they enter their Mo&s;ques. There are al&s;o to be &s;een the ruins of other fine Paintings and Images, partly defaced by the Turks, and partly by Time.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tians are not admitted here without Con|nivance or Bribery, and tho&s;e only by the <HI>Franks;</HI> for if a Jew or Greek be found in the Mo&s;que, he mu&s;t either die, or turn Turk. It was built by <HI>Ju|stinian</HI> the Emperor on recovery of his health, hav|ing vowed in his Sickne&s;s, if God &s;pared him, to found one of the beautifule&s;t Churches in the World, to the honour of the Soveraign Wi&s;dom, for <HI>Sophia</HI> in the Greek &s;ignifies Wi&s;dom, and this is the only Ancient Structure of this kind in <HI>Con|&s;tantinople;</HI> for though there are many &s;tately
<PB N="15" REF="12"> Mo&s;ques in the City, they are of late building, E|rected by the Sultans and Sultane&s;&s;es, who&s;e Names they bear; as that of <HI>Solyman</HI> the Magnificent, which is very Stately; of <HI>Achmet Mohomet Selim;</HI> with tho&s;e of <HI>Chadazet</HI> and <HI>Valide,</HI> new and very Beautiful, by the Idea of which la&s;t you may gue&s;s at the re&s;t; it was Founded by the Sultane&s;s <HI>Valide,</HI> Mother to <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Fourth, &s;eated in the mid|dle of a large &s;quare Court, re&s;embling a va&s;t Cloi|&s;ter, by rea&s;on of the Arched Roof that environs it like a Portico, and under are divers Fountains with Cocks, where tho&s;e that are polluted wa&s;h them|&s;elves e'er they enter the Mo&s;que; it has but one Gate, and that is &s;urrounded by a Portico of extra|ordinary heighth, paved with white and black Marble, &s;upported by 64 Pillars of Red Mar|ble; the Platform is adorned with Painting and Figures after the Turki&s;h manner. This Portico is covered with many little Domes, and a very large one in the middle higher than the re&s;t, the whole Structure being very curious Work covered with Lead; there are four Turrets at the four Corners of the Buidling, called Minarets, &s;lender, but very high, with Balconies round them, &s;tanding like May|poles, with Cre&s;&s;ents on the Globes, and winding-Stairs, ju&s;t enough for the Mue&s;ans to creep up with their loud Bawlings to call the People to Prayers, for they have no Bells, where clapping their hands on their Ears, they go round the Turret in the Bal|conies, and when they cry their Voices are heard very far. They call in their own Language, which in Engli&s;h is to this Effect; <HI>God is a great God, give Te&s;timony that there is but one God, come yield your &s;elves up to his Mercy, and Pray him to forgive you your Sins. God is a great God,</HI> &amp;c. This Mo&s;que is Vaulted and Adorned with a great number of Lamps and Globes of Gla&s;s, and in the Globes are many curious Devices, as Galleys, the model of Mo&s;ques, Trees, Flowers, Cities, and the like. There is a Table at the upper end, where u&s;ually the High Altar &s;tands in the Romi&s;h Churches, and
<PB N="16" REF="13"> to this they turn their Faces when they &s;ay their Prayers, over which is placed the Name of God, Written in Gold Arabick Characters, and over-a|gain&s;t that are fixed two Brazen Candle&s;ticks hold|ing Wax Tapers of a va&s;t bigne&s;s. The Sultans or Emperors lie Buried in their Mo&s;ques, their Tombs being covered with Rich Carpets, which have been laid on <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Tomb at <HI>Mecha;</HI> for they conclude that &s;anctifies them, and keeps them from evil Spirits; their rich Turbans are placed at the Head, and if they have been Warlike, their Cimiters, and other Military Atchievements, are fix-on or near them: Divers Alcorans are chained to the Tombs, and there is always one or other that has a Pen&s;ion left them by the decea&s;ed Emperor to Read the Alcoran to the People that come to vi&s;it the Tomb, and to Pray for his Soul. Sultan <HI>Amu|rat</HI> has two of his Wives placed at his Head, and eleven of his Children round him; and at the head of the Tomb or Coffin is a convenient place where his Prayer-Books are laid up, appearing through a Latten Grate, adorned with Gold and precious Stones. The Keepers of the Turbe, or little Cha|ple, in the Mo&s;que where the&s;e Bodies lie, are obli|ged at certain hours of the day to Pray for the Souls of the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The Ar&s;enal is at the end of the Port belonging to the City, being a very compact Building; it contains a con&s;iderable extent of Ground; the Gal|leys are laid up there under 120 Arches; the Chri|&s;tians are not permitted to come into it, but the Turks &s;ay, there are Arms for 60000 Men, be&s;ides Furniture for Shipping, and in the Baths many thou&s;and Slaves are &s;hut up who lead mi&s;erable Lives. The Captain Ba&s;&s;a, and all the Officers depending on the Admiralty, have their Apartments, and lodg in the Ar&s;enal, that they may be ever ready to re|ceive Orders about the Naval concerns.</P>
<P>In this City are many Hans and Kervan&s;erais, which &s;erve mo&s;t for Warehou&s;es, being &s;trongly built, barred and guarded to prevent Imbezlement.</P>
<PB N="17" REF="13">
<P> The Hans con&s;i&s;t of four &s;ides of building, en|clo&s;ing a &s;quare Court with a Fountain, the Roof con&s;i&s;ts of little Domes covered with Lead; and here Foreign Merchants, who bring their Goods to lay up, find entertainment; they only contain two Stories, divided into Rooms, that have no intercour&s;e one with another, the lower Story con&s;i&s;ts of Warehou&s;es for Goods, and the upper divided in|to little Chambers, where Strangers that are Tra|vellers Lodge, but they mu&s;t furni&s;h them&s;elves with all nece&s;&s;aries, or otherways they mu&s;t want both Furniture and Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>The Karvan&s;erais are built after the &s;ame fa&s;hion, only the Stone work reaches but to the fir&s;t Story, and the re&s;t is Wood and Brick, whereas the Hans have entire Stone Walls of a good thickne&s;s for their better &s;ecurities again&s;t Pilferers. They have each of them but one Gate, and in the latter indigent Per&s;ons are permitted to Lodg, from half a Crown to a Crown a Month.</P>
<P>The next thing of Note in the City is the Serag|lio, which Chri&s;tians and Jews are prohibited to en|ter, except Amba&s;&s;adors, and &s;ome few Attendance when they have their Audience, and then &s;ome crowd in with them that are not concerned, or ra|ther bribe their way, but it is very dangerous for them to pa&s;s any further than the Second Court, and further I could not gain acce&s;s, though I profered liberally, and the Turks rarely refu&s;e Money where they can oblige one for it, and therefore I &s;hall give a de&s;cription as far as I could ob&s;erve, and &s;ome|thing over according to the be&s;t information I could get.</P>
<P>The Seraglio is the Prince's Pallace, but of very irregular building; it is built on a point of Land that juts out into the Sea, as I have before men|tioned, and &s;urrounded with Walls of a greyi&s;h Stone, adorned at top with a Parapet and Battlement, &s;uitable to the City Walls; it is near 4 miles in compa&s;s, but the greate&s;t part is Gardens; the Build|ing clu&s;ters together, like the ancient building of low
<PB N="18" REF="14"> Ca&s;tles or Fortifications, &s;o that on the out &s;ide they have nothing of Magnificence, except a few guilt Spires and Globes; the chief Entry is near <HI>Sancta So|phia,</HI> and the Gate is like that of the entrance into many Ancient Cities, without either beautiful Architecture, or Ornament; yet the Capigy keep their Court of Guards under it, and carefully watch the entrance.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing this Gate it leads into a large Court, where on the right Hand is the Apartment for &s;uch as fall &s;ick in the Seraglio, with matted Sopha's along the Walls, &s;o that they are no better lodged then in Ho&s;|pitals; on the left Hand is a Magazine for furni&s;hing 1000 Men, that the Grand Signior's Dome&s;ticks may, upon any &s;udden In&s;urrection in the City, defend the Palace, and the Per&s;on of their Empe|ror; though notwith&s;tanding this precaution, &s;eve|ral of them have been depo&s;ed by the Rabble and Soldery, and come by violent Deaths, as their Hi|&s;tories make mention at large.</P>
<P>There being little el&s;e remarkable in this Court, I pa&s;&s;ed into the Second, fronted with two large Porticoes; on one &s;ide are the Grand Signior's Kitchens, where they Dre&s;s for Him, his Women, and &s;uch as live at his Charge in the <HI>Seraglio;</HI> and on the other &s;ide are his Stables, where 100 Hor&s;es may conveniently &s;tand, and many Apartments where the Officers Lodg; and this great Court is en|tered on Hor&s;eback by none but the Grand Signior, all others alight at the Gate: It is not &s;o big as the fir&s;t, but con&s;i&s;ts of a Square, extending 200 Paces every way; there is round it a Gallery in the Form of a Cloy&s;ter, &s;upported by a great many Marble Pillars, and covered with Lead; and at the back of that there are Domes, ranging from one end of the Court to the other, covered with Lead, as the for|mer, and on the right Hand, where the Kitchins are, the Stables I mentioned being towards the Sea. The Jani&s;aries draw up in this Court to the right Hand, and the Hor&s;e to the Left; in the middle there is a delicate Fountain, &s;haded with Cypre&s;s, and Scyca|more
<PB N="19" REF="14"> Trees; and heretofore near this Fountain, the Grand Signiors cau&s;ed the Heads of the Ba&s;&s;a's, and other great Men of the Court that di&s;plea&s;ed them, to be cut off, as a Terror to others; for the Go|vernment is De&s;potical, and the Lives of the Sub|jects are at the di&s;po&s;al of the Prince. On the left Hand, at the end of the Court, is a Hall, where the Divan or Council of State &s;its, and on the Right, a Door which gives entry into that, and is more pro|perly called the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and none but tho&s;e who have particular Orders can pa&s;s it.</P>
<P>Very near this Seraglio, within the &s;ame enclo|&s;ure is another building Founded by <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great, and intended a Pallace, but now it is called the <HI>Old Seraglio,</HI> having many additional Buildings, yet not fair on the out &s;ide, though the&s;e and the other have co&s;tly Gildings and Paintings within; the Turks in general having little regard what out &s;ide &s;how their Hou&s;es make, &s;o they appear Sumptuous and Magnificent within. It is &s;urrounded with Walls of an unu&s;ual heighth, without any Windows on the out &s;ide, the better to prevent the Women from being &s;een; and here the Reigning Sultan &s;huts up the Wives of his Predece&s;&s;ors, whom he Seque|&s;ters from the World, except he likes any of them him&s;elf, or plea&s;es to be&s;tow them on the great Men of his Empire, for their &s;ignal Services; otherwi&s;e this is a kind of a Nunnery for Life.</P>
<P>There is yet a Third Apartment, properly called a <HI>Seraglio,</HI> joyning clo&s;e to that of the Grand Sig|nior, &s;o that he can pa&s;s to it by Galleries privately, when he has a mind to divert him&s;elf there. What more I could gather by &s;ight at a di&s;tance is, that this place which is &s;o much talked of, as the Pallace of the greate&s;t Emperor in the World, e&s;pecially as to largene&s;s of Territories, gives but an incon&s;i|derable Pro&s;pect; and one at a di&s;tance can form nothing regular in it, it looking like a confu&s;ed Ma&s;s of Building, in Apartments and Domes.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior has here his Officers, who have a great many under them; mo&s;t part of them
<PB N="20" REF="15"> are Eunuchs, Blacks of <HI>Aethiopia;</HI> and others, that are mo&s;t comely of their kind; they formerly were only Gelt, but it is &s;aid, that Sultan <HI>Solyman,</HI> one day &s;eeing a Gelding back a Mare, and perform, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, the office of a Stallion, came Home and cau&s;ed them all to be &s;moothed by the Belly, to prevent their dabling with his Women, of which Wound a great number died, and now they make Water through a Silver Pipe, which they put into the orrifice of the Root of their Yard, to prevent polluting them&s;elves, by &s;cattering their Urine on their Ve&s;tments; for then, till they have Ab&s;olution, they think they are unclean, as I &s;hall &s;hew hereafter; and now they cut off the Genitals of Children they buy, or have as Tribute, upon the Borders of <HI>Aethi|opia,</HI> and other Negro Countries; and though ma|ny die under this u&s;age, for it is not done till they are 8 or 10 years old, that they may &s;ee whether they are Docil or Ingenious; yet they have enough to &s;erve in all the Seraglio's in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> for there are others belonging to the Grand Signior, be|&s;ide tho&s;e at <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> and many to the Ba&s;&s;a's, and Governors of Provinces in divers Countries; and the&s;e are &s;o Jealous, or rather Envious, which makes them to watch over the Women &s;o narrow|ly, that they are rarely too cunning for them; they are lodged in a &s;eparate Apartment, together; and the &s;ingle Te&s;timony of one of them, again&s;t the greate&s;t Subject in the Empire, co&s;ts the party his Life; nay, a bare Sollicitation, or too near a View, without any Act, is &s;ufficient for a Strangling; as for Example, Sultan <HI>Amurat</HI> u&s;ed a Pro&s;pective Gla&s;s, to di&s;cover the Actions of tho&s;e that were in the City, and by that means, e&s;pying a Man at a Win|dow, with the like Pro&s;pective, taking a view of one of his Sultana's, walking in the Garden of the <HI>Seraglio;</HI> he thereupon &s;ent a Capigi, with 4 Mutes, who entered the Hou&s;e, and immediately Strangled the over curious unfortunate.</P>
<P>The&s;e Eunuchs have, in a manner, the &s;ole Go|vernment of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> but particularly of the
<PB N="21" REF="15"> Women; and when the Sultana's take the Air in the Garden, the Bo&s;tangis, or Gardeners, &s;tand round the Walls, holding Staves with long and broad pieces of Cloth fa&s;tned to them, which makes them as though they were Blind, and is much higher than the Garden Wall, to which their Backs are turned, it being Death to look, if any of the Eunuchs per|cieve it, and complain of it; and this Jealou&s;ie pro|ceeds &s;o far, that no Boat is &s;uffered to come with|in 400 Paces of the Garden-Wall, though it is ve|ry high, if the Sultana's be walking there; and if any per&s;ume it, there are Sentinels advantageou&s;ly placed, to Fire at them; &s;o that tho&s;e who have bu&s;ine&s;s by Water, are con&s;trained to fetch a great compa&s;s about. But, notwith&s;tanding this Jealou&s;ie, which, in a great or le&s;s Degree reigns all over the Empire, the Turks e&s;teem Women as very incon&s;i|derable Creatures, without Souls, denying that they go to Heaven; That they were only made to &s;erve for the u&s;e of Man, and be obedient to him, and their main end was de&s;igned for Generation; otherwi&s;e, unle&s;s to &s;atisfie their Lu&s;ts, they e&s;teem them &s;carce Rational, and little better then Bea&s;ts: In a word, the&s;e of Quality are but &s;plendid Slaves, and the meaner &s;ort mi&s;erable ones.</P>
<P>The Eunuchs have the Charge of bringing up the Grand Signior's Pages, called <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">hn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">glians,</HI> who are the beautifule&s;t Youths that can be got, and for the mo&s;t part of Chri&s;tian Extraction, but taken &s;o young from their Parents, that they ea&s;ily Educate them in the Mahometan Super&s;tition with great care, till they are about 28 years of Age, and are taught &s;uch Arts, and u&s;ed to &s;uch Exerci&s;e as their Incli|nation chiefly leads them to. If they are of good natural parts, and prompt in under&s;tanding, they u&s;ually ri&s;e to the greate&s;t preferments in the Ottoman Empire; if not, they are turned out, and entered into pay and employments of other natures, living but meanly; but whil&s;t they live in the <HI>Se|raglio,</HI> the greate&s;t Preferment they can, ri&s;e to, is to be of the number of the Forty, who are neare&s;t
<PB N="22" REF="16"> the Grand Signior's Per&s;on, and the&s;e the Eunuchs look narrowly after lea&s;t they &s;lip among the Women, or defile one another by unnatural Lu&s;t, for the&s;e are not di&s; membred; among the 40 mentioned, there are four in high E&s;teem, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Selihtar</HI> or <HI>Sword-bearer;</HI> the <HI>T&s;choader,</HI> who carries the Cock; the <HI>Ibrictar,</HI> who carries Water ready to pour on the Grand Signior's Hands when he requires it; and the <HI>Kuptar,</HI> who carries the Pot of Sorbet to give him when he calls for it. There are Seminaries of the&s;e <HI>Ichnogleans,</HI> as at <HI>Peza, &amp;c.</HI> where they are E|ducated, and growing up, &s;ent to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> to be entertained in the Grand <HI>Seraglio.</HI></P>
<P>The next that make a con&s;iderable Figure in the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> are the Bo&s;tangis or Gardeners, over whom is a Ba&s;&s;a, called the <HI>Bo&s;tangi</HI> Ba&s;&s;a; he has his Lodg|ing in the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and the Priviledge of wearing his Beard, not any be&s;ide him and the Grand Signior doing it, the re&s;t being Shaved in token of Servi|tude; He is very great with the Prince, and always &s;teers his Barge when he goes to take the Air on the Sea, &s;o that having his Ear, and liberty to Di&s;cour&s;e with him, all the Grandees &s;tand in fear of him, and much con&s;ider his Power, labouring to keep him their Friend; and when any con&s;iderable Per&s;on is put to Death in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> he is &s;ent to fetch his Head.</P>
<P>There are in this City many little <HI>Seraglioes</HI> belonging to the great Men of the Court, but on the out-&s;ide, they look much like old decay|ing Buildings, and &s;ome hold, that they built them without external Beauty and Ornament, becau&s;e the Grand Signior &s;hould not be Jealous of their Pride, as a&s;piring to too much greatne&s;s, but with|in it is otherways, for they have lovely Apartments, adorned with Gold and Azure; the Floors are co|vered with Rich Carpets, &s;o that tho&s;e who enter pull of their Shooes, to prevent any injury they may do them; the Walls of mo&s;t of them are faced with poli&s;hed Tiles, like <HI>China</HI> Ware; in their Halls, and Chambers, they have ri&s;ings about a Foot,
<PB N="23" REF="16"> which they call Divans, covered with richer Carpets than the Floor, and Imbrodered Cu&s;hions placed in order on them. Here they Re&s;t, receive Vi&s;its, and &s;pend the be&s;t part of the Day, and the Wo|mens Apartments in all the&s;e, are &s;eparated from tho&s;e of the Lodgings; none but the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e, and &s;ome Eunuchs, are &s;uffered to enter where they are; the Women &s;tir little abroad, having Baths in their Hou&s;es, with &s;uitable Attendance, and other convenient Nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>Thus having de&s;cribed all that is worthy of Note in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> I &s;hall &s;peak &s;omething of the Neighbouring places, which may properly be term|ed the Suburbs of this great City; and in the fir&s;t place <HI>Galata</HI> is a very plea&s;ant place, &s;eparated from the City only by the <HI>Port,</HI> which may be cro&s;&s;ed in Caiques, or Wherries, who are always attending; however, taking a compa&s;s you may go by Land, and have a very fine Pro&s;pect of the Country. This Town is pretty Large, and formerly belonged to the <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> and then was more con&s;iderable, for it held out &s;ome time again&s;t the whole Power of the Ottoman's, after <HI>Mahomet</HI> the Second had taken <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> the Hou&s;es are Fair, and well Built, mo&s;tly Inhabited by <HI>Greeks,</HI> though it is the u&s;ual Re&s;idence of <HI>Franks,</HI> and they have five Mona&s;te|ries there, which much Beautifie the place; and near the Sea &s;ide, there is the fine&s;t Fi&s;h-Market that may be &s;een in any Country, for the Fi&s;h|monger's-&s;hops are &s;tocked with &s;uch numbers of various kinds of Fi&s;h, on Market days, that Strangers admire how they &s;hould procure them; the <HI>Greeks</HI> keep many Taverns here, &s;o that there are frequent di&s;orders, by rea&s;on of drunken Peo|ple, though great care is taken to prevent it.</P>
<P><HI>Pera,</HI> and <HI>Tophana</HI> are two other plea&s;ant little Towns; the Former is appointed for the Re&s;idence of mo&s;t Amba&s;&s;adors; tho&s;e of the Emperor of <HI>Ger|many,</HI> King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and Republick of <HI>Ragou&s;a,</HI> having u&s;ually their Re&s;idence in <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> the French Amba&s;&s;ador's Hou&s;e is here, very &s;tate|ly,
<PB N="24" REF="17"> having a curious Pro&s;pect of the <HI>Seraglio.</HI> The latter is the place where they ca&s;t their great Guns, and that in the Turki&s;h Language &s;eems to give it its Name; the Hou&s;es in both are very finely Built, ri&s;ing and falling plea&s;antly, &s;o that at a di&s;tance, they &s;eem to repre&s;ent a kind of an Amphitheatre.</P>
<P>To the&s;e I might add <HI>Ca&s;&s;umpa&s;ha,</HI> which lies fir&s;t if one goes by Land, and appears like a great Vil|lage; her Galleys and Ships are Built and laid up with great conveniency, for it is accommodated with 120 Arched Docks, or Hou&s;es; in the way to this the Ocmeidan, or Field of Arrows, a very &s;pacious place, where the Turks exerci&s;e &s;hooting with the Bow; and many re&s;ort thither to pray for &s;ucce&s;s on their Arms, and any thing they &s;tand in need of.</P>
<P>One may go in a Caique from <HI>Constantinople</HI> to <HI>Schudaret,</HI> which the Turks call <HI>I&s;codar,</HI> it being but a good Mile. In the way there is a Tower built on a Rock in the Sea pretty &s;trong, the Guns command the Port, and the Mouths of the <HI>White</HI> and <HI>Black-Sea;</HI> the latter is &s;o called, not becau&s;e the Water is Black, as &s;ome imagine, but by rea|&s;on of the many ca&s;ualties that happen upon the ri|&s;ing of &s;udden Storms, that ca&s;t Ve&s;&s;els away, to the lo&s;s of many Lives; and be&s;ide, it not being very broad, there are &s;everal Currants cau&s;ed by the <HI>Danube, Bori&s;tenhes, Tunais,</HI> and other &s;maller Rivers, that di&s;charge their Waters into it, and occa&s;ion many Eddies that drive Ships on the Rocks, where they are lodged or &s;plit; but to return,</P>
<P>In the Tower I mentioned, is a fine Well of fre&s;h Water, and &s;ome call it <HI>Leander</HI>'s Tower, but for what rea&s;on I know not. <HI>Schudaret</HI> is a plea&s;ant Village on the <HI>A&s;ian</HI> Shoar; The Grand Signior has a &s;tately <HI>Seraglio</HI> in it, beautified with lovely Gar|dens; and a little lower, on the &s;ame &s;ide, &s;tands <HI>Chalcedon,</HI> anciently very Famous, and Celebrated by the four General Councils held there; yet time has laid the Structures of Antiquity in Ruins, &s;o that at pre&s;ent it is but an incon&s;iderable Village,
<PB N="25" REF="17"> which &s;tands like the Ruins of <HI>Troy,</HI> as a Memorial there was once &s;o famed a place. In another walk of four Hours from <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> is the <HI>Prince</HI>'s I&s;le, a very plea&s;ant place to take the Air in, for though it is not great, it contains two little Towns, inhabited by <HI>Greeks.</HI> The Coa&s;t of the <HI>Black Sea</HI> is al&s;o a curious place to take the Air upon. This is the <HI>Thracian Bo&s;phorus,</HI> which coming from the <HI>Black Sea</HI> to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> mingles its Waters with the <HI>White Sea,</HI> and is but a Mile over at the broad|e&s;t place, no more than 12 Miles in length, and all about this Channel are a great many lovely Hou&s;es and Gardens, &s;o that pa&s;&s;ing it, one would conclude it the lovelie&s;t Pro&s;pect in the World; the Fruits are here Plentiful, and very Excellent; on the <HI>A&s;ian</HI> &s;ide there is a pretty Ca&s;tle, where Sultan <HI>Ibrahim</HI> was hid 20 Years, when Sultan <HI>A|murat</HI> put his other Brothers to Death; and along the Shoar are other Villages, in which one may be furni&s;hed with what is needful.</P>
<P>In this Channel they take great quantities of good Fi&s;h of divers Sorts, and among&s;t them the <HI>Sword Fi&s;h,</HI> &s;o called, becau&s;e it has a long broad Bone on the Snout of it, like a Sword, or rather jaged like a Saw on the edges; there are &s;tore of Dolphins, u&s;ually playing about the Boats, as al&s;o many other curious varieties; &s;o that I may conclude, <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and the Towns adjacent, to be exceeding plea&s;antly Scituated, which having thus &s;ufficiently de&s;cribed, I now pa&s;s to other u&s;e|ful Ob&s;ervations, during my &s;tay in the Chief Ci|ty of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire.</P>

<P>The Judges they call <HI>Cadis,</HI> who are divided into all parts of the Empire, in Cities, or great Towns, to decide Controver&s;ies; yet their Suits, e&s;pecially between the Turks, are very few, and they make a quick di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s, there being rarely Advocates allowed, to Procra&s;tinate bu&s;ine&s;s; nor do they admit of Evidence in Writing, always ta|king it by word of Mouth, &s;o that Bills Bonds, and other Contracts, are not &s;ignificant in <HI>Turkey;</HI> yet there is much Bribery u&s;ed, and he that can give the Judge mo&s;t, u&s;ually carries the Cau&s;e. They puni&s;h Crimes with great &s;everity, and &s;o &s;peedily, that rarely Thefts are committed by any private Turk, and the People in all Cities are careful to prevent Murthers, for if the Murtherer e&s;cape, a great &s;um of Money is required of the Per&s;on be|fore

<P>The Divan con&s;i&s;ts of the Grand Vi&s;ier, and &s;e|veral other Vi&s;iers of the Bench, and there the important bu&s;ine&s;s of State is Controverted, and Cau&s;es heard; of all which the Grand Vi&s;ier gives the Grand Signior an account; nor dares he di&s;&s;em|ble, or hide any thing, as knowing the Grand Sig|nior has a Window into it, before which hangs a thin Curtain, through which he can &s;ee and hear, but not be &s;een, and therefore the Vi&s;iers know not but he may be always there in the Divan time, which keeps &s;uch an awe over them, that they do better Ju&s;tice than in other places, to prevent their Heads flying off, as it &s;ometimes has happen'd, up|on the lea&s;t defect or partiality. Next to the Ba&s;&s;as, the Beglerbegs, or Lords of Lords, are in highe&s;t Authority in Temporal matters; they have Com|mand over Provinces and Armies, and under them are divers <HI>Zanzacks,</HI> as their Deputies; but their Government is during the Prince's plea&s;ure; and the Chief of the&s;e is the Beglerbeg of <HI>Rormania</HI> in <HI>Greece,</HI> under who&s;e Command are 21 Zanzacks.

The Spahi are mo&s;t <HI>Europeans,</HI> trained up Young to manage a Hor&s;e, and exerci&s;e Cavalry, having Pay. There are al&s;o <HI>Spachoglanians, Silicta|rians,</HI> and <HI>Olofagians,</HI> who have Lands or Pen&s;ions a&s;&s;igned them to &s;erve in the Wars; for none, as in other Countries, can purcha&s;e Lands for Inheri|tance, the whole Empire being in Fee-&s;imple the Grand Signior's, and all things revokable at his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Hor&s;emen march under a white Banner, mo&s;tly Armed with &s;trong Coats, Bows, Arrows, Fire-Arms, Cimitars, Battle-Axes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There
<PB N="32" REF="21"> are another &s;ort of Hor&s;emen, called <HI>Caripices,</HI> but not above 800: The&s;e are u&s;ually the Grand Sig|nior's Guard, &s;urrounding him in the middle of the Batallion of the Jani&s;aries, and are Fellows &s;o de&s;|perate, that they will venture on any Enterpri&s;e; being for the mo&s;t part Sons of great Commanders, trained up from their Youth in this way.</P>
<P>The Jani&s;aries are the <HI>Turk's</HI> be&s;t Footmen; and the&s;e at fir&s;t are taken when Children from their Pa|rents, mo&s;tly Chri&s;tians, but brought up in the Mahometan Super&s;tition; inured to all manner of hard&s;hip, and have Officers over them, to teach them the u&s;e of Arms; and the&s;e enclo&s;e the Grand Signior when he marches with the Army: They ware white Caps; their Arms are Harquibu&s;es, and &s;harp cutting Cimitars, who &s;ince their fir&s;t In&s;titution, as a Nur&s;ery of Soldery, have been the chief &s;upport of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire; they are commanded by an Aga, or Chief Commander, to whom nothing is &s;o fatal as their Love and Re|&s;pect, for that creats in the Grand Signior a Jealou|&s;ie of his a&s;piring, and on this Account many of the Aga's have lo&s;t their Lives, but mo&s;tly they are put to Death privately, to prevent their being re&s;|cued; and if he be a Court Favourite, the Jani&s;a|ries are di&s;tru&s;tful of him, and &s;ometimes on failure of their Pay, and other Occa&s;ions, Mutiny, and Murther him; &s;o that on either hand he &s;tands ve|ry tickli&s;h in his high promotion.</P>
<P>The Jani&s;aries in <HI>Con&s;tantinople, &amp;c.</HI> have great Halls, or Apartments, where they Sleep together, their Beds being placed on either &s;ide; and all tho&s;e of a Battallion u&s;ually Dine together, the younger being appointed to &s;erve the elder, and if any one ab&s;ent him&s;elf from his Lodging, unle&s;s upon leave, or &s;ome particular occa&s;ion, he is &s;ure to be &s;evere|ly Cudgeled, yet obliged, by way of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his puni&s;hment, to Ki&s;s the Hand that inflicts it.</P>

<PB N="33" REF="21"> the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Territories. They have power to Ar|re&s;t Malefactors, and &s;ee good Orders kept, being in great E&s;teem with all Men: &s;o that if they go into the Market to buy any thing, they will have it at their own price, the Vender not gain-&s;aying; but this may be concluded to proceed rather from the effects of Fear than Love; and they carry &s;uch a Vogue, that no Grand Signior thinks his Throne &s;etled, till they approve of him; &s;o that to purcha&s;e their good Opinion, the new Sultan pays off their Arrears, di&s;tributes Money among&s;t them, and en|crea&s;es their Stipends.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e are the Chief Strength of Foot, yet there others, but not &s;o &s;erviceable, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Acoujces,</HI> which &s;erve as a forlorn hope; the&s;e re|cieve no Pay, but have liberty to plunder in War time, allowing the Sultan a fifth part of the &s;poil. The A&s;api, which are Rabble, rai&s;ed as there is need for them, and &s;erve as Pioneers, being of &s;o &s;mall account, that they are &s;et in the Front of the Battle to receive the fir&s;t &s;hock, and tire the Ene|my with &s;laughtering them; and when a Town is Be&s;ieged, they are &s;et fir&s;t to &s;cale the Walls, to a|mu&s;e the Be&s;ieged, and their &s;lain Bodies &s;erve as a Rampart to mount on, or fill up the Ditch; and &s;o little are the&s;e mi&s;erable Creatures e&s;teemed, that a Spahi having taken five of them in a Civil War, offered them to a Butcher for a Sheep's Head, which he refu&s;ing, the Spahi &s;wore if he would not make the exchange, he would cut of their Heads, and boyl them, and was preparing to do it; but the Butcher, though a Man of Blood, &s;eeing him in earne&s;t, gave him the Sheep's Head to &s;ave the poor Wretches Lives, and afterwards &s;et them at liberty.</P>
<P>The Grand Signior has always 6000 Gunners in Pay, mo&s;t of them Rhenegado Chri&s;tians, turn|ed Mahometans, many of them are <HI>French</HI> Men; and the&s;e are called <HI>Topegi;</HI> Twelve thou&s;and others are in Pay, to look after his Ammunition; his Car|riages are very numerous, and his Train of Artil|lery
<PB N="34" REF="22"> large. There are 3000 attending the Grand Signior's plea&s;ure, called <HI>Chiaus,</HI> or <HI>Chiaux,</HI> who act in the nature of Serjeants at Arms, and are in good E&s;teem, being often employed in Emba&s;&s;es; but their chief employ is to carry Letters, or Com|mendations from the Grand Signior, or Grand Vi|&s;ier, and are impowered to apprehend Mallefactors, yet go not to the Wars, unle&s;s the Grand Signior is there. The&s;e are Commanded by a Ba&s;&s;a of their own order, who is of &s;uch Credit, that when he is &s;ent for any Man's Head, though he has no War|rant in Writing, his Authority is not di&s;puted.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Armies March, it is with as great &s;ilence as may be; they are under a regular Di&s;cipline, and live very &s;paring in Diet; for the mo&s;t part, on Rice, dried Fruits, Bread baked in the A&s;hes, and powdered Fle&s;h dried in the Sun, rarely complaning as the Chri&s;tians do of want, but patiently endure and wait till they can be &s;up|plied; no Women are found in their Armies, and the Servants attending on great Men are Li&s;ted, and do the Office of Soldiers in their March; they ob&s;erve the beck of the Hand, or &s;hew of the Coun|tenance, as a Command, and under&s;tand to obey it; nor dare they in their March, enter into any Corn Field, nor plunder in any friendly Country, as other Soldiers do, under pain of Death, &s;o that the People, as with us, are not concerned when great Armies march, as knowing they &s;hall lo&s;e no|thing if they look to it, that it be not privately &s;tolen; and Theft is &s;everely puni&s;hed among&s;t them.</P>
<P>To &s;upport this, and other Charges in the Em|pire, the Grand Signior's Incoms are accounted 20 Millions a Year, mo&s;t of it ari&s;ing from Pre&s;ents, Cu&s;toms, and Confi&s;cation; though in his Domi|nions, whole Kingdoms lie in a manner wa&s;t, by rea&s;on of the va&s;t number of Men con&s;umed in War, or rather, indu&s;try is di&s;couraged; for &s;hould they get Wealth by their Labour, it is theirs but du|ring the Prince's plea&s;ure, and none are certain how &s;oon he may &s;trip them of all.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="22">
<P> As for the Religion of the Turks, it is no Ancienter than <HI>Mahomet,</HI> an Impo&s;tor, Born in <HI>Arabia,</HI> who &s;et it abroach about the Reign of <HI>Heraclitus,</HI> the Em|peror, for taking his Tenents from the <HI>Arian</HI> and <HI>Ne&s;torian</HI> Here&s;ies, denying the Divinity of our Sa|viour, he drew a Multitude after him, and becom|ing Powerful, forced many to follow his Opinion; and &s;ince it has been carried on by the Sword to &s;pread &s;o wide. The <HI>Jewi&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religi|on being then mo&s;t prevalent, after dilating with him&s;elf, he leaned to the fir&s;t, and mixed his own wild Notions with what he took out of the Mo&s;aick Law, and from the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Jews,</HI> as a di|&s;tinction between Clean and Unclean Meats, Cir|cumci&s;ion; but the latter not performed at the end of 8 Days, as the <HI>Jews</HI> Cu&s;tom is, but at the end of 8 Years, when the Child is able to make a Confe&s;|&s;ion of his Belief, and &s;peak in the <HI>Arabick</HI> Tongue, <HI>viz. There is but one God, and</HI> Mahomet <HI>is his Pro|phet, one God, and equal Prophets.</HI> At the Circum|ci&s;ion, there is Fea&s;ting three Days, for all the Friends and Kinsfolks. The Female Children only &s;peak the Words; yet the Moori&s;h Mahometans, in &s;ome parts, u&s;e a kind of a Circumci&s;ion to their Females, cutting off a bit of the Nimphae. If any Chri&s;tian turn Turk, he is led about the Streets, as in Triumph, and receives Pre&s;ents and Gifts as he pa&s;&s;es, to encourage him to per&s;evere in his new undertaking; but the Men, be they of what Age they will, that &s;o renounce their Faith, mu&s;t be Circumci&s;ed, yet the Turks afterward &s;et Light by tho&s;e that Renounce, and will rarely Tru&s;t or Pre|fer them, &s;aying, <HI>They are not worthy to be tru&s;ted that Renounce their Faith, be it what it will.</HI></P>
<P>Their Laws is contained in the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> wherein among other things, one God, the Maker of the World, and of all Things, is owned. Can the <HI>Turks</HI> Honour Chri&s;t as a great Prophet, but deny him to be the Son of God? They are forbidden by their Law to Wor&s;hip Images, or to have any &s;et up in their Mo&s;ques; but their <HI>Alcoran</HI> indulges them in
<PB N="36" REF="23"> Sen&s;uallity, and promi&s;es them much of Worldly Felicity, or &s;uch like plea&s;ures as we have here, in another World, but obtain'd and carried on with greater Ea&s;e and Happine&s;s, for their Paradi&s;e con|&s;i&s;ts in the enjoyment of hand&s;om Women, and &s;uch like Trifles, though here they look on them to have no Souls, and &s;carcely Rational Creatures.</P>
<P>They hold their Sabbath on our Friday, and their Lent la&s;ts 30 days, during which time they neither Eat nor drink in the Day, but take their repa&s;t af|ter Sun-&s;et; but not till they have Notice by the Voice of Men from the Minarets or Steeples; they al&s;o ab&s;tain from Women; Wine is forbidden in their Law, yet many times they Carou&s;e it &s;o lu&s;tily in private, that they get Drunk; this Lent they call <HI>Ramadan.</HI></P>
<P>Their <HI>Bairam,</HI> or <HI>Easter,</HI> is continued with great &s;hew three Days, but it begins not preci&s;ely at a time, becau&s;e it mu&s;t commence at the New of the Moon, yet not till &s;he appears; and tru&s;ty Per&s;ons are &s;ent to watch on the Mountains, and high places, to &s;ee her, and he that fir&s;t di&s;covers her has a Reward, and then it begins with Proclamation; they have other publick times, as the little <HI>Bairam, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>If during the reading of the Law they look Back, &s;cratch their Heads, or do any thing that is un&s;eem|ly, they think they have lo&s;t the benefit they were to have received at that time; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s they &s;eem to be very preci&s;e in their Devotions, though generally very Ignorant in Learning; yet of late, &s;ome of the better &s;ort put their Children to learn the <HI>Arabick</HI> Tongue, becau&s;e the <HI>Alcoran</HI> is Written in it.</P>
<P>By their Law they have leave to Marry as many Wives as they can maintain, and when any of them proves with Child, the Husband mu&s;t not Carnal|ly know her till &s;he is delivered. There is another kind of Marriage Contract during Plea&s;ure, called <HI>Kebin,</HI> mo&s;tly practi&s;ed by Strangers, who, for a certain Sum, &s;ignifying their intention to the <HI>Cadi,</HI> who notes down the Contract, may have a Wife
<PB N="37" REF="23"> for as long as he plea&s;es; but when he turns her a|way, he mu&s;t give her what he bargained for, and keep the Children, if &s;he has any by her. The <HI>Turks</HI> often Divorce their Wives with &s;hewing little or no Cau&s;e, but the Wives have not that Priviledge. They mu&s;t prove before the Judge, that their Hus|bands are not able to keep them, or that they have attempted to u&s;e them again&s;t the cour&s;e of Nature, and the like. If a <HI>Turk</HI> debauch a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Wo|man, both of them, upon Conviction, mu&s;t &s;uffer Death, unle&s;s he can per&s;wade her to change her Faith, and &s;o it is with a Chri&s;tian and a Turki&s;h Woman, he mu&s;t turn <HI>Turk,</HI> or be burnt, unle&s;s by largely Bribing the <HI>Cadi,</HI> he can get it off, which &s;ometimes happens, if &s;he be of mean Rank.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this liberty to Marry, and take &s;o many Wives, the <HI>Turks</HI> are great <HI>Sodomites,</HI> and the Ba&s;&s;a's, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are guilty of keeping hand&s;ome Youths, whom they purcha&s;e as Slaves, to &s;atisfie their Brutal Lu&s;ts this way, yet they keep it as pri|vate as may be.</P>
<P>The Chief Interpreter of their Law is the Muf|ti, or Arch-Prie&s;t. The Grand Signior nominates and chu&s;es him from among the Learned Men in their Law. He is greatly Reverenced by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and termed the Head of their Church, and the de|cider of all Controver&s;ies ari&s;ing in matters of Reli|gion. All the Ba&s;&s;a's are &s;ubject to his Directions, as a Rule to them in their Government. He aba|&s;eth him&s;elf not to &s;et down in the Divan, only he pa&s;&s;es very &s;tately through it, when he is &s;ent for by the Grand Signior, who ri&s;es at his approach to do him Honour, then places him by him on his Seat, and di&s;cour&s;es familiarly with him about matters of Religion, State, or Previous Que&s;tions; and this Honour is allowed to no other.</P>
<P>Next to the Mufti, in this &s;ort of Dignity, are the Cadile-Squires, Tali&s;men, or two Doctors of the Law, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to examine the Cadi's, or Judges, di&s;per&s;ed in the Provinces of the Empire; and the&s;e for the mo&s;t part are attendant on the
<PB N="38" REF="24"> Grand Signior. One has Juri&s;diction over the <HI>Eu|ropean</HI> Cadi's, and the other over the re&s;t, and are Sovereign Judges within their own Juri&s;diction, in all cau&s;es about matters of Religion, and are, as it were, Patriarchs. The&s;e are of great Authority, having places in the Divan, and in the Council of Ba&s;&s;a's, where they are con&s;ulted in the weighty Af|fairs of the Empire.</P>
<P>There are a degree of Churchmen not belonging to their Law, called <HI>Mulli,</HI> and the&s;e are in&s;tead of Bi&s;hops, but directed in their proceedings by the Mufti.</P>
<P>Another &s;ort there are, called <HI>Nuderi&s;i,</HI> who act in the Nature of Suffragans, and have under them &s;everal young Doctors of the Law, called <HI>Naipi,</HI> who are con&s;tituted, in the ab&s;ence of the Cadi's, to hear and Redre&s;s grievances.</P>
<P>Next to the foregoing, are the <HI>Hagi,</HI> who write Books, and inferior to them are the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ii,</HI> who Read to them as they Write. The&s;e are their &s;everal degrees of Churchmen and Lawyers, for the <HI>Turks</HI> are govern'd by a kind of an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Law, ac|cording to their <HI>Alcoran.</HI> They have many Colleges, which they call <HI>Medre&s;&s;a</HI>'s, Scituate in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and divers other Cities.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>The Belief of the</HI> Turks, <HI>and many other things practi&s;ed among them; as their Charity, Mourning at Funerals, Games, Ju&s;t Ob&s;ervances,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Turks</HI> believe that after any Per&s;on is Dead and layed in the Grave, the Angels come to examine them, and that they have Angels to guard them in their Life time, every one being appointed to a particular Member; and when they take up any piece of Paper in the Street, lea&s;t the Name of God &s;hould be writ on it, they will not take it a|long with them, for fear of putting it to prophane U&s;es, but &s;tick it on the next Wall, &s;o that the Cranies are often found &s;tuck full of them; yet they will Swear by the Name of God, but it is to what is Truth, for otherways they are looked on as Igno|minious, and Infidels. As to their Belief, they hold that divers Bea&s;ts go to Paradi&s;e, as the Camel of <HI>Selch:</HI> (one of their Prophets) the Ram of <HI>Abra|ham,</HI> offered up in Sacrifice; the Cow of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who&s;e A&s;hes was mingled with the Water of Puri|fication, which &s;eems to be the Golden Calf in <HI>Ho|reb; Solomon</HI>'s Ant; the Parrot of the Queen of <HI>Sheba.</HI> They al&s;o believe <HI>Jonas's</HI> Whale that ca&s;t him on dry Land, and <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s A&s;s &s;hall be there like|wi&s;e; four Sleepers, and a little Dog, who led them to a Cave in time of Per&s;ecution, where they &s;lept 300 Years, which &s;eemed to them but as one Night, for one of them going to buy Victuals when they awaked with Antiquated Money, the time was di&s;|covered by the Date of the Coin. They hold in <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> according to <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s promi&s;e, that they
<PB N="40" REF="25"> &s;hall enjoy Virgins, fre&s;h Coloured, with large Black Eyes, and Beautiful Boys attending them; who at fir&s;t &s;hall be but Fifteen, and never exceed Thirty Years of Age, always in a Bloom or Spring of Beauty; and that God &s;hall appear to them every Friday, which is their Sabbath; that there they &s;hall have Rivers, plea&s;ant Fields, Gardens, and the like. They &s;ay tho&s;e in Hell &s;hall Drink &s;cald|ing Water, and Eat of the Fruit of a Tree called <HI>Zacon,</HI> which grows out of the bottom of Hell, and ri&s;es to a great heighth, the Branches of it being like the Heads of Devils; and if tho&s;e that are in Hell have a little Faith, after they are purged by Fire, to con&s;ume their Sins, they &s;hall be wa&s;hed in a Water called <HI>Selzaboul,</HI> and then admitted into Paradi&s;e; but tho&s;e that have not Faith when they are con&s;umed to A&s;hes, &s;hall be Created a new, and &s;o prepared Eternally to endure the Torments; they hold a kind of Purgatory, but they &s;ay there are ma|ny back Doors, by which they may give the Devil the &s;lip, if they are watchful and cunning. They Pray for the Dead, and invocate a &s;ort of Saints of their own making.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> have many Fountains, and in wa&s;hing they think they are free from Defilements, even after having lain with their Wives, Noctural Pollutions, their Urin dropping on their Garments, or touch-a Dog, and indeed in any other matters that they conceive they are Polluted; and they are &s;o Nice in it, that upon Travelling, they will go a great way to &s;eek Water, and if they find none, to do it with Sand; and indeed they keep their Bodies in all parts extream cleanly, even to Super&s;tition, in ma|ny Rights and Ceremonies they u&s;e, as the Abde&s;t and Gou&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ober <HI>Turks</HI> are very Charitable to Men and Bea&s;ts, doing all they can to relieve them in their Nece&s;&s;ities, &s;o that they &s;upply the Poor for the mo&s;t part, without putting any to the Shame of appear|ing in the Streets to Beg; &s;ome of them when they die, leave Pen&s;ions to maintain Bea&s;ts, to keep them du|ring
<PB N="43" REF="25"> their Natural Lives; and in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> I &s;aw a Bitch who had got into a Corner to ca&s;t her Whelps; the <HI>Turks</HI> no &s;ooner &s;aw it, but they made a Wall with Bricks and Stones about her, and &s;eve|ral run and fetched Victuals, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, which in a wonderful manner &s;hewed their compa&s;|&s;ion towards the poor Creature, nor did one or o|ther leave attending her, till the Puppies were ta|ken from her, and &s;he capable of &s;hifting for her &s;elf.</P>
<P>Images, as I have already hinted, are prohibited among&s;t the <HI>Turks,</HI> but they are very de&s;irous of curious Paintings, though they are not Arti&s;ts at it. There is a prohibition of U&s;ury by their Alcoran, though it is connivingly done by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the <HI>Jews</HI> practice it frequently. Swines Fle&s;h is counted unclean among them, and &s;ome <HI>Turks</HI> would rather die than Eat it; nor dare the Shoo|makers u&s;e Hog's Bri&s;tles in &s;owing their Shooes, if it &s;hould be known, they would be puni&s;hed. When a <HI>Turk</HI> dies, there is great Mourning; the greater the Quality, the more the Women fall a howling ex|ce&s;&s;ively, and tho&s;e that cannot frame them&s;elves to it, hire tho&s;e that are accu&s;tomed to it, and as often as any Vi&s;itants come, the Lamentation is renewed, and when the Corps is in the Grave, they go often thither to Weep, the Widow expre&s;&s;ing what good things her decea&s;ed Husband has done for her; they often &s;pread Carpets with Victuals, that tho&s;e that pa&s;s by may Eat it, and Pray for the Soul of the decea&s;ed. They &s;et at the Head of the Grave a Stone, which they &s;ay, the Angel that is to examine him &s;its on; and they bid the Dead Per&s;on an&s;wer him &s;toutly, and not be afraid. They burn Incen&s;e about the Graves, as they &s;ay, to &s;care away the Evil Spi|rits, and Pray to God to be merciful to the Party; and according to his Quality, he has a Turban placed at the Head of the Grave, or Tomb, by which he is di&s;tingui&s;hed, as to his Rank.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Turks</HI> in general, they are well propor|tioned, &s;trong in Body; and the Women are mo&s;tly

<P>This Caravan amounts mo&s;t times, to between 10 and 20000, and &s;ometimes a far greater number. I &s;hall not trouble the Reader with a Journal of the way, becau&s;e I Travelled it not; however, it mu&s;t

They have a Guard of Jani&s;aries, with many others who go Armed, and their number gathers by the way, like a Snow-ball rowled from a &s;teep Mountain; they appear all the way very devout, the number con&s;i&s;ting of Men, Women, and Children; &s;ome indeed, take the ad|vantage of Trade and Commerce, carrying &s;tore of rich Wares with them; all the way, tho&s;e in Pilgrimage Sing Ver&s;es of their <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and be&s;tow Charity according as they are able.</P>

<PB N="49" REF="31"> Sultans, and <HI>French</HI> Sultana, in great State. The City is about half a French League in length but not Walled in all parts; and upon a little Hill in the middle of it, is a little Ca&s;tle, found to be built by a Maiden Prince&s;s, who was cured of a Lepro|&s;ie by the Hot Waters; for as a wonder in Nature, there runs a Rivulet of Hot Water, almo&s;t &s;calding tho&s;e that &s;tep into it at fir&s;t; and there one &s;ees the Tomb of <HI>Roland,</HI> or <HI>Orland,</HI> a very Valiant Man, who defended the City again&s;t all A&s;&s;aults his Sword, Mace, and other warlike Habiliaments hang by it; but this Tomb &s;tands on a Hill, in a little Chapel, where u&s;ually a Turki&s;h Hermit Lives.</P>

<P>This whitene&s;s is occa&s;ioned by the River <HI>Nile,</HI> that carries it a great way into the Sea, and at this di&s;tance from the Coa&s;t, we had many Flurreys, ac|companied with great Showers of Rain, but they were in a little time over, and the Wind coming about North-we&s;t, we tacked, and &s;ent up again to di&s;cover, but no Land appearing, we kept &s;ail|ing South and South-we&s;t; but fearing to lo&s;e the Windward of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> we &s;tood Ea&s;t and by South, but finding that a mi&s;take, we tacked about that we might get nearer to the Land, from which we knew we could not be far di&s;tant, and held on the &s;ame Cour&s;e, till we found our &s;elves obliged to Tack, and bear away South-we&s;t; here we &s;aw the Moon ri&s;e Ecclip&s;ed, half an hour after Sun-&s;et, which was not vi&s;ible in <HI>England, Holland, France, &amp;c.</HI> becau&s;e there, according to the Almanacks, the Ecclips, was to happen at 3 in the Afternoon, Feb. 11. and the next Day we percieved the Sea very white about us, and the Man that looked out cryed Land; &s;ome thought it to be <HI>Damiette,</HI> and others <HI>Bouquer;</HI> but in the mean time, that we might not Sail to Leeward, we continued our Cour&s;e South-we&s;t, and in a few Hours we Tacked and &s;tood North-ea&s;t; and about a quarter of an hour after the Wind turning North-we&s;t, we bore away South and South-we&s;t, and in conclu&s;ion we made the <HI>Bouquer,</HI> and a little after the <HI>Farillon,</HI> or Light-Hou&s;e of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and at 3 of the Clock in the Afternoon the &s;ame day, we entered the Haven by the South.

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>The Author's Arrival at</HI> Alexandria, <HI>and what is ob&s;ervable there; and his pa&s;&s;ing from thence to</HI> Caire.</HEAD>
<P>BEING now at Land, and recovered from my Sea fatigue, by &s;uitable Refre&s;hments, my cu|rio&s;ity lead me to take a view of this once &s;o Re|nowned City, Founded by <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, when, after his <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Expedition, he brought <HI>Ae|gypt</HI> under his Subjection, though it is not compa|rable to what it has been in its flouri&s;hing time, as may appear by the Ruins about it, and within its Circumference, and the Venerable remains of An|tiquity.</P>
<P>This Town is called by the <HI>Turks,</HI> who po&s;&s;e&s;s all <HI>Aegypt, Skenderia.</HI> There are in it &s;everal Fon|dicks, or large Hou&s;es, where the <HI>Engli&s;h, French, Dutch,</HI> and other <HI>Europeans,</HI> have their appointed Re&s;idence, paying no Hou&s;e Rent, but on the con|trary, the Con&s;uls receive Money of the Grand Signior Annually to keep them in &s;uitable Repair, they being every Evening &s;hut up, and the Keys carried to the Aga of the Ca&s;tle, who &s;ends them back every Morning; they are likewi&s;e &s;hut up, as is the Water-gate, every <HI>Friday,</HI> during Noon Pray|er; and this ari&s;es from an old Prophe&s;ie, that the <HI>Franks,</HI> for &s;o they call all Chri&s;tian <HI>Europeans,</HI> &s;hall become Ma&s;ters of that place, during Noon Pray|er, on a <HI>Friday.</HI></P>
<P>Scarce any thing of the Ancient Town remains un|ruinated but the Walls, and &s;ome Buildings towards the French Fondick, which are almo&s;t ruined; it being ea&s;ie to di&s;tingui&s;h the Ancient from the Later Buildings, for the latter are low, and ill-contrived.</P>
<PB N="55" REF="34">
<P> This once Famous Town has three Ports, one called the Old Harbour; it is pretty large, but the entrance difficult, &s;o that but few Ve&s;&s;els put in there; the other two are &s;eparated by a little I&s;land, and higher up, the I&s;land was anciently called <HI>Pha|ros,</HI> and is joyned to the main Land by a Stone Bridge, and in the middle of it is a &s;quare Tower, where the Powder is kept, and at the end, another Ca&s;tle, called <HI>Farillon,</HI> &s;tanding where the Ancient Watch-Tower of <HI>Pharos</HI> &s;tood, which was accoun|ted one of the Seven Wonders of the World. The fir&s;t of the&s;e Ports is a Harbour for the Galleys, and is on one &s;ide defended by the <HI>Farillon,</HI> and on the other by a &s;lighter Ca&s;tle; but the&s;e Ports are en|cumbered with Stones and Rocks, requiring a skil|ful Pilot to guide in Ve&s;&s;els of any con&s;iderable Bur|then. The Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e here is Farmed by a <HI>Turk,</HI> and has a <HI>Jew</HI> for his Deputy, and indeed the Re|ceipt of Cu&s;tom mo&s;tly pa&s;&s;es through the <HI>Jew</HI>'s Hands, who can plea&s;ure, or di&s;plea&s;ure many that Trade there: There is al&s;o an Old Cu&s;tom hou&s;e, but of little Note.</P>
<P>In <HI>Alexandria</HI> there is a Mount made of Ancient Ruins, on which &s;tands a &s;quare Tower, and a Sentinel, who puts out a Flag &s;o &s;oon as he de&s;crys a Sail, and every Ve&s;&s;el coming into the Port pays him &s;omething. All Officers here depend on the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> who places and di&s;places them at his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The Walls of this Town have Fals, Brays, and are flanked with great &s;quare Towers, about 200 Paces di&s;tant one from another, and a little Tower between every two of them; in each of the great Tower there is a large &s;quare Hall, the Vault of it &s;upported by Pillars of <HI>Thebaick</HI> Stone, and a great many Chambers above, and over the&s;e a large Platform, of 30 Foot Square, and each of the&s;e anciently were able to maintain 200 Men; the Walls are very thick, and every where Port-holes in them; the&s;e Ca&s;tles have Ci&s;terns, repleni&s;hed with Water, but mo&s;t part of tho&s;e that encompa&s;&s;ed the
<PB N="56" REF="35"> ancient <HI>Alexandria,</HI> as it was in its Former Extent and Lu&s;tre, are ruined by the length of Time, and neglect of Repair: but if the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Officers catch an <HI>European</HI> Chri&s;tian in the&s;e Towers, they pre|&s;ently charge him as a Spy, come to view the &s;trength of the Town, and then nothing but Money will re|lea&s;e him from Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Near this Town is the famous Pillar of <HI>Pompey,</HI> &s;o much celebrated by Hi&s;torians; it &s;tands about 200 Paces di&s;tant, upon a little ri&s;ing, placed on a &s;quare Pede&s;tal, about 7 or 8 Foot high, that re&s;ting on a &s;quare Ba&s;is, about 20 Foot broad, and 2 Foot high, made up of &s;everal large Stones; the Body of the Pillar is an entire piece of Garnet, a|bout 6 Fathom in Compa&s;s, having on the Top a very curious Capital; and it mu&s;t create Admira|tion, by what &s;trong Engines &s;o va&s;t a Stone could be brought thither, which makes &s;ome believe it was ca&s;t, and made of a certain Cement on the place, which Art was u&s;ual with the Ancients, though now, for any thing that appears, it is lo&s;t.</P>
<P>In this place appears the remains of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>'s Pal|lace, but all that can be called entire of it, are &s;ome Porphery Pillars, and a Fronti&s;piece, which looks very curious. There is a <HI>Kihalis,</HI> or <HI>Canal,</HI> cut from the <HI>Nile,</HI> which brings Water to this place, and is the only good Water they have; this fills their Ci&s;terns that are Magnificently made, and pla|ced under in Vaults, the whole Town being hol|low underneath, and &s;upported by fair Marble Pil|lars, and &s;ome &s;ay, there are fair Streets under Ground, wherein there are Shops to be &s;een &s;till; but the <HI>Turks,</HI> for &s;ome Rea&s;ons, will not di&s;cover them, nor &s;uffer any to go down in the Vaults that lead to them. All along, the Gardens bor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">er on the <HI>Kahalis,</HI> planted with Lemon, Orange, and o|ther curious Trees, as Ca&s;&s;a, and Corab Trees, and the like.</P>
<P>Here &s;tands St. <HI>Catharine</HI>'s Church, kept by the <HI>Greeks,</HI> where they &s;how a hollow Pillar, on which they &s;ay her Head was cut off, and would make
<PB N="57" REF="35"> Travellers believe, that the Blood and Fat it is &s;meered with, remained ever &s;ince her Decolation. There is a pretty neat Church built to St. <HI>Mark,</HI> where he received his Martyrdome, and the Picture of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> &s;aid to be drawn by St. <HI>Luke;</HI> there are to be &s;een in &s;ome ruinous places, Pillars of Porphyrian Marble, and Obelisks of Garnet, with Hierogliphicks upon them, yet but one of them &s;tanding on a Pede&s;tal.</P>
<P>Many other things are here to be &s;een, but not to be tedious, I &s;hall omit the de&s;cribing of all the Statues and Figures mo&s;tly encumbered with Ruins, which are very numerous, and rather demon&s;trate the former Magnificence of the place, than what it now is; and having &s;etled my Affairs here, I hir|ed a Jani&s;ary for my greater &s;ecurity to pa&s;s on with me to <HI>Caire,</HI> the Principal place of <HI>Aegypt;</HI> but be|fore I went thither, I vi&s;ited <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto,</HI> about 60 miles from <HI>Alexandria,</HI> there being but one place to bait at by the way, called <HI>Maudie,</HI> or the Pa&s;|&s;age, becau&s;e you Ferry over a Lock there, full of Fi&s;h, though there is a Ca&s;tle nearer called <HI>Bou|quier,</HI> to defend the Road, the re&s;t, or the greate&s;t part, being De&s;art Sands; on the other &s;ide of the Water is a Kervan&s;erai, or Inn, where you may be welcome to Eat and Drink &s;uch as you bring with you for nothing; mo&s;t part of this Journey you Travel along the Sea-&s;ide: You may &s;ee where the <HI>Nile</HI> di&s;charges it &s;elf into the Sea, which is a very dangerous Pa&s;&s;age, there being Saiques and Barks u&s;ually ca&s;t away in venturing, e&s;pecially when the Sea is rough, for then it occa&s;ions an Eddy in the Water of the River, which turning the Ve&s;&s;els round ca&s;ts them on Shoar. <HI>Ro&s;&s;etto</HI> is the ancient <HI>Canopus,</HI> lying in a Branch of the <HI>Nile,</HI> falling into the Sea five Miles below the Town; and this is ac|counted the neate&s;t Town in <HI>Aegypt</HI> for its Piazza's and Hans, being a Town of good Trade, encom|pa&s;&s;ed by five Gardens, the Hou&s;es high and well built, Provi&s;ions plenty, and at a very cheap Rate. From hence taking Water on the <HI>Nile,</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed with
<PB N="58" REF="36"> many others to <HI>Boulac,</HI> a Port of <HI>Caire.</HI> This is a long narrow Town, built on the &s;ide of the <HI>Nile,</HI> and has about it many plea&s;ant Gardens and Coun|try Hou&s;es; and here by Cu&s;tom, you mu&s;t, being a <HI>Frank,</HI> pay at your fir&s;t coming to <HI>Caire</HI> a Pi|a&s;tre, which is received by <HI>Jews,</HI> Authorized for that purpo&s;e.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>A View of</HI> Caire, <HI>and what is Remarkable in it,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAIRE</HI> is the Capital City of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and with it runs the fortune of the whole Country; when it was wre&s;ted from the <HI>Mamaluke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> by Sultan <HI>Selim,</HI> Emperor of the <HI>Turks, Anno</HI> 1571, who cau&s;ed <HI>Thomambey,</HI> the <HI>Mamaluke</HI> Sultan, to be hanged on a Hook, under one of the Gates, and exterminat|ing the whole Race of tho&s;e Men; &s;etled the <HI>Turk|ki&s;h</HI> Government under a Ba&s;&s;a, as his Viceroy. This City is Scituate at the Foot of a Hill, on which a Ca&s;tle is built to Command it, which renders it unhealthful, in&s;omuch, that the Pe&s;tilence often rages there, and &s;weeps away a multitude of Peo|ple, for the Wind intercepts the free pa&s;&s;age of the Wind and Air, and occa&s;ions a &s;tifling Heat; and the good Water they have is brought on Camels Backs from <HI>Boulac</HI> in <HI>Bourachios,</HI> which is half a League from the City, and this Water is &s;old very dear.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="36">
<P> This City is exceeding large, and full of Peo|ple, being in the form of a Cre&s;cent, yet is narrow, and may be compa&s;&s;ed in two Hours and a quarters Walking: It is &s;urrounded with many &s;tateley Pal|laces of the Beys, and other great Men of the Coun|try; the Hou&s;es are little, but full of People, &s;o that when the Plague &s;weeps away 200000, it is hardly perceived, e&s;pecially in a little time after. The Walls have hand&s;om Battlements and Towers, at le&s;s than 100 Paces interval, able to hold many Soldiers; they appear to have been very Stately, but at pre&s;ent mo&s;tly ruinous. The Ca&s;tle likewi&s;e is much decayed, the <HI>Turks</HI> being Supine, make lit|tle account of repairing them; near the Walls are large Church Yards, full of Sepulchers, adorned with fair Stone, that gives a plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect, and all agree, that in this City there are 23000 Pre|cincts, and as many Mo&s;ques, there being one in a Precinct at lea&s;t. A Precinct is a &s;et part, and in &s;ome of them there are &s;everal Streets; and each Precinct is watched by two Men Chained together, to prevent them from &s;eparating, and they demand certain dues of the Inhabitaints and Strangers; the Sons-Ba&s;&s;a keeps the Keys of the Padlocks that lock up their Chains. The Streets here are &s;hort and nar|row, except the Street of <HI>Bazar</HI> and the <HI>Khalis,</HI> which is dry but 3 Months in the Year, and few People frequent it; the re&s;t are little, turning and winding, which makes me believe the Hou&s;es were fir&s;t built without any de&s;ign of compacting them into a City, every one placing his Hou&s;e on the ground he liked be&s;t to build on, without con&s;idering whether they &s;topped the Street or not. Some Mo&s;|ques are very Magnificent, with curious Fronti&s;|pieces and Gates, with very high Minarets; but the greate&s;t part are little and incon&s;iderable; The faire&s;t is called <HI>Degemiel Azem.</HI> The Hou&s;es are high, with flat Tara&s;s-Roofs, where they take the fre&s;h Air when the Sun is down, and lie on Carpets there in the heat of Summer.</P>
<PB N="60" REF="37">
<P> On the out-&s;ide the Hou&s;es make little &s;how, but within, they are Richly adorned with Gold and A|zure, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of Quality, and their Halls have an open round hole in the Roofs, to let in the cool Breathings of the Air, and commonly there is a Cupulo, or Lanthorn, over the hole, to keep out blu&s;tering Winds.</P>

<P>The A&s;cent con&s;i&s;ts of between 200 and 210 Steps; the Top, to tho&s;e that are below, appears like the point of a Spire, though on the top there is a Platform of 24 Foot &s;quare, and is paved only
<PB N="61" REF="37"> with 12 Stones, &s;ome of which are broken, or ra|ther worn out by time; and from thence you have a Pro&s;pect of <HI>Old Caire, Boulack,</HI> the Ruins of the Ancient famed <HI>Memphis,</HI> the Mountains and De&s;arts of <HI>Aegypt;</HI> but it requires a &s;trong Head to look down to the bottom, where Men and Cattle &s;eem no bigger than Crows, and a good Arm cannot throw a Stone beyond the Foundation, for it will light upon &s;ome part of the Work; there were for|merly Steps on every &s;ide, but Time, the Con&s;um|er of all things, has wa&s;ted and crumbled &s;everal of the Stones, &s;o that in &s;ome parts there are dread|ful Precipices, therefore Strangers take with them a Guide, who is u&s;ed to A&s;cend, and it is their &s;afe&s;t way: They as it were clamber up the Steps, being of that heighth, that they are forced to u&s;e their Hands and Knees, &s;ome 3 Foot, and others le&s;s; there is a Room by the way to re&s;t and refre&s;h one, in which are divers Images, Sculptures, and other Contrivances, according to the manner of the An|cients, and near the bottom you enter into a de|&s;cending Alley 30 Paces long, and 3 Foot high, &s;o that one mu&s;t &s;toop very low; at the end of this there is a place to creep through like a little Wicket, which is even with the Ground; and this brings you into another little Alley like the former, only in this you mu&s;t a&s;cend, and this Alley ends in two others; that on the right Hand has no inclination, and leads to a vaulted Chamber 18 Foot long, and 12 broad; at the entrance into this Alley is a very deep Well, or Pit, though de&s;titute of Water, in which are divers Caves, entering at the bottom, by the &s;ides, and into this one mu&s;t be let with Ropes, having a lighted Torch or Tapour, for it is exceed|ing Dark, which you mu&s;t take care to &s;ecure, by rea&s;on of the great number of Bats that are bred, and flutter about that dark aboad; wherefore the more Prudent carry Tinder-boxes along with them, to re-kindle the extingui&s;h'd Light: Oppo&s;ite to the la&s;t Alley, there is another that begins &s;o high in the Wall, that we were con&s;trained to climb up
<PB N="62" REF="38"> to it, but to make amends, we found it much high|er and broader than the re&s;t; and having walked 70 Paces, &s;till a&s;cending, a &s;pacious Room di&s;clo&s;ed it &s;elf, which was 33 Foot long, and 16 broad, pav|ed with 9 entire Stones, the length of them equal to the breadth of the Room; the Walls are of a curi|ous Porphery, and at one end there is an empty Tomb of a very hard Stone, between 7 and 8 Foot long, and between 3 and 4 Foot broad, but broken about the Edges by &s;uch as vi&s;ited the place, to car|ry with them as a Token. This Tomb is held to be made for the &s;ame <HI>Pharaoh</HI> that was over-whelm|ed in the <HI>Red-Sea,</HI> pur&s;uing the <HI>I&s;raelites.</HI></P>
<P>The Piramid &s;tanding neare&s;t to this is little, in compari&s;on of it, being only 150 Foot, and each of the Sides or Faces 200 Foot broad: The com|mon opinion is, that it was built by a beautiful Woman, called <HI>Rhodope,</HI> who was <HI>Ae&s;op</HI>'s fellow Slave in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> with whom the King became Ena|mour'd, and &s;he got &s;o much Money by her Love Intrigues, as defrayed the Charges of building it. The third is little inferiour to the fir&s;t, for it is 510 Foot in heighth, and the breadth of each Face is 630 Foot, being a manner a Quadrilatrial Figure, as are the re&s;t.</P>
<P>There is to be ob&s;erved the Ruins of an Ancient Temple, before each of them, and a huge Idol of Stone &s;tanding very near tho&s;e ruinated Structures, about 26 Foot high, and in all, proportionable, where they &s;ay, Oracles were delivered of old; but the Cheat now appears plain, for in the Head of it there is a deep hole, wherein a Man may ea&s;ily hide him&s;elf; and here, no doubt, the Prie&s;t was placed who gave the Oracle to delude the People, his Noi&s;e coming through holes made in the No&s;trils of the Idol; and &s;o we may conclude of the re&s;t, who with Ambiguous An&s;wers, abu&s;ed tho&s;e that came to en|quire future Events, or to be re&s;olved in doubtful Matters. This <HI>Cole&s;&s;us</HI> is cut in a Rock, repre&s;ent|ing a Woman.</P>
<PB N="63" REF="38">
<P> From hence we Travelled to a large Village, called <HI>Sacara,</HI> the Burying-place of the Ancient <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> in which there are Catacombs, or Se|pulcheral Vaults. The&s;e are di&s;tinct Subteraneous Chambers built of &s;quare Stone; and in the&s;e are the Bodies that are called the <HI>Mummies</HI> of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> where a Moor is the Ma&s;ter of them, to open them for &s;uch as will give him Money, the entrance o|therways being covered with Sand; the opening is above, through which one mu&s;t go, and &s;o down by a Ladder, or with a Rope; they were heretofore full of Bodies of the Ancient <HI>Aegyptians,</HI> &s;o skilfully Em|balmed, that they were, perhaps, pre&s;erved 3 or 4000 Years, with their Epitaphs in Letters of Gold on Cloth; their Coffins were enriched with Hiero|gliphicks, and the Figures of the Decea&s;ed in Reli|evo, and many Images, much Gold, and Jewels, were found with the Bodies; but the covetou&s;ne&s;s of the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> and the curio&s;ity of the <HI>Franks,</HI> who purcha&s;e them of the former at a dear Rate, have almo&s;t exhau&s;ted them, though 'tis be|lieved there are &s;ome that were never opened, and that the <HI>Moors</HI> conceal them out of Avarice, to take out what is precious, and rai&s;e the price of &s;uch Rarities to a higher Rate: Being let down in one of the&s;e Vaults, I &s;aw many parts of Bodies, but lit|tle entire, they being much broken and mangled by &s;uch as had, out of Curio&s;ity, carried away pieces of them.</P>
<P>This place is full of Piramids, but mo&s;t of them very &s;mall, unle&s;s one that never was fini&s;hed, which, if compleated, had been near in bigne&s;s, to the large&s;t I have mentioned, proportionable to the Ba|&s;is; there are in it, A&s;cending and De&s;cending Al|leys, at the end of which are 3 Rooms; but it not being fini&s;hed as the re&s;t, as to what it might have been is but Conjecture; &s;ome hold that this mighty Work cea&s;ed when <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great &s;eized on <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and the <HI>Greeks</HI> wre&s;ted the Kingdom from the Race of the Ancient <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Kings.</P>
<PB N="64" REF="39">
<P> On the other &s;ide of the <HI>Nile,</HI> oppo&s;ite to this place, are to be &s;een the Ruins of the Ancient <HI>Memphis,</HI> where the <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Kings held their Court; but Time, and the &s;poiling Hand of War, has made it as <HI>Troy,</HI> a heap of Ruins: It &s;eems to have been exceeding large, and extended along the Ri|ver, till you come over-again&s;t <HI>Old Caire,</HI> &s;o that although I &s;pent many Hours in viewing the&s;e Ruins, I could find nothing of Note, but pieces of Pillars, and Images, the low Foundations of what &s;eem to have been Ancient Temples, and little el&s;e Remar|kable.</P>
<P>Returning towards <HI>Caire,</HI> I came to <HI>Maltherea,</HI> 3 Miles di&s;tant from the City, where are a great many curious &s;hading Orange-Trees, and a delicious Spring of Water, which is &s;aid to have been the abiding place of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, when &s;he fled with our Saviour into <HI>Aegypt:</HI> There are likewi&s;e Mirtle, and Lemon-Trees, that render the place very plea&s;ant. This Spring and <HI>Jo&s;eph's</HI> Well in <HI>Caire,</HI> are all the Springs of Water I could &s;ee or hear of in <HI>Aegypt.</HI> That Well is of a prodigious Depth, cut in a &s;olid Rock 106 Foot deep, yet &s;o broad and winding are the Steps, that two Oxen may go down to the bottom, where, in a Hole, is a very curious Spring, and that Water is held precious; near it are &s;ome remains of <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Pallace, and a Room called <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s Hall, adorned with Gold and Azure, and many Pillars, al&s;o his Steward's Hou&s;e, remarkable for 12 Columns of Thebaick Marble. Near to this there is a dreadful Pri&s;on, in which, it is held, that Patriarch was ca&s;t, upon the fal&s;e Accu&s;ation of his Mi&s;tre&s;s; this con|&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal Dungeons cut of the Rock, and if Tradition be true, his ca&s;e in that place could not but be lamentable, for it appears very Di&s;mal and Loath&s;ome.</P>
<P>The common received opinion that it Rains not in <HI>Aegypt</HI> is groundle&s;s; the Showers fall &s;eldomer, and le&s;s violently than in other places, &s;o that a great part of the Country is dry and barren Sand;
<PB N="65" REF="39"> the chief Fertility is occa&s;ioned by the melting of the Snow from the Mountains, and the overflow|ing the River <HI>Nile,</HI> of which famous River, I come now to &s;peak more particularly.</P>
<P>This River has its &s;ource near the Mountains of the Moon, or Jews Mountains in <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> where it is very &s;mall, but gathers many Rivers in long run|ning, which makes it &s;well much; it runs through the length of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> having its cour&s;e from South to North, di&s;charging it &s;elf into the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, by two Mouths, making a Triangular I&s;le, by the <HI>Greeks</HI> called <HI>Delta,</HI> becau&s;e it re&s;embles the Greek &Dgr;; the&s;e Mouths are Navigable for large Ve&s;|&s;els; for though it has others, they are le&s;s, and can properly be called no other than Rivulets; It is broader than the <HI>Seine,</HI> and for the mo&s;t part glides &s;moothly, unle&s;s where its Cataracts make it rage and foam, by its falling from a great heighth; when it overflows it appears like a little Sea, the Water is naturally thick and muddy, but they have a way to Clarifie it, by running it through Ve&s;&s;els filled with white Earth, and then it is very whole&s;ome. Mo&s;t of the Cities, Towns, and Villages, are Sci|tuate on its Banks, or very near it, for the conve|niency of Water, which is precious in that Coun|try, for there are &s;o many Villages, that you have &s;carce pa&s;&s;ed one, but you come at another. This River abounds not much with Fi&s;h, and there is but one good &s;ort found at <HI>Caire,</HI> called a <HI>Variole,</HI> but there are a va&s;t number of <HI>Crocodiles</HI> in it, who, no doubt, devour the Fi&s;h; this is an Amphibeous Creature, living at plea&s;ure in the Water, or on Land; the Head of it is flat above and below, and the Eyes or it indifferently big, and very darki&s;h; they have a long &s;harp Snout, with long &s;harp Teeth, but no Tongue to be perceived; the Body large, and all of a bigne&s;s; the Back covered with high Scales, like the Heads of large Nails, of a greeni&s;h colour, &s;o hard, that they are Proof again&s;t a Halbert; their Tailes are very long, covered over with Scales, but the Belly is white, and pretty ten|der;
<PB N="66" REF="40"> it has four &s;hort Legs, with five Claws on the foremo&s;t Feet, and but four on the hinder. It grows as long as it Lives, and &s;ome are about 20 Foot from Head to Tail; the&s;e great ones many times &s;nap young Children at Land, and &s;ometimes put up their No&s;es, and pull People out of their Boats in the River; &s;o that many go with Spikes to pre|vent their putting up their No&s;es; and it is dange|rous to &s;wim, where their haunts are: But that they Weep when they have taken their Prey, is, for what I could find, a Fable.</P>
<P>To take the&s;e Creatures, they make a great many Pits by the River &s;ide, and cover them with rotten Sticks, &s;o that pa&s;&s;ing over, the Sticks give way, and they fall in; then Men let down a Rope with a running Nooze, to muzzle their Snouts, and &s;o they draw them up, and kill them for their Skins, which they &s;ell to Strangers at good Rates: None but the <HI>Moors</HI> will Eat of their Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o in the River a Hyppopotamu&s;es, or Sea-Hor&s;e, and is of a tawney Colour, the hinder part like a Bouffler, though its Legs are &s;hort, yet very thick; it has the muzzle of an Ox, and &s;ome are about the bigne&s;s of a Camel: its Head re&s;em|bles that of a Hor&s;e, and is very great, but the Eyes are &s;mall; the Ears little; the Neck thick; the Tail like an Elephant's; in the lower Jaw it has four Teeth half a Foot long, two of them are crooked, and as big as the Horn of an Ox in circumference.</P>
<P>This famous River mainly fertili&s;es <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and without it, it would be de&s;olate; nay, if it &s;hould fail but one Year to overflow, there would be a Fa|mine in the Land, which &s;ome hold it did for &s;even Years, when the mighty Famine happen'd in <HI>Jo|&s;eph</HI>'s time, re&s;trained by an Almighty Power; but &s;eeing that Famine extended to others Land., this may be but Conjectural; when it Ebbs it leaves a fat nitreous Slime, that greatly enriches the Land, and makes it produce plentifully. They have few Fruit-Trees, and no Wine; for the &s;mall quantity of Grapes found, are thick rhined, producing lit|tle
<PB N="67" REF="40"> Juyce. The chief Trees are, the Fig-Trees of <HI>Pharo,</HI> the true Sycamore, Ca&s;&s;a, Papyrus, Colo|ca&s;&s;e, Orange, Lemon and Myrtle Trees, but the&s;e three la&s;t are mo&s;tly brought thither; they have great &s;tore of Onions, and other Roots; al&s;o plen|ty of Corn, and divers &s;orts of fine Fowls, as Yel|low Birds, wild Turtles, Pidgeons, and Larks; and indeed <HI>Aegypt</HI> may be rightly termed an Earthly Paradi&s;e, did not the Oppre&s;&s;ion of their Gover|nors much abate the Peoples plea&s;ure, but that is very great, as in other parts of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Em|pire.</P>
<P>At the cutting of the Khalis, or Sluyce of the <HI>Nile,</HI> there is a great Fe&s;tival held, and triumphant Shows by Land and Water, with much rejoycing for many Days, and whereas the Ancient <HI>Aegyptians</HI> u&s;ed to Sacrifice a Boy and a Girl taken by lot, to their fancied God of the River; but the <HI>Turks</HI> abo|li&s;hed that ill Cu&s;tom, and in&s;tead thereof, place on each &s;ide, in the Night, the re&s;emblance of a Man and a Woman in Fire, by fixing Lamps ve|ry dexterou&s;ly to repre&s;ent their Figures.</P>
<P><HI>Aegypt,</HI> as other Countries under the Turki&s;h Government, con&s;i&s;ts of a mixed People, of divers Nations, as <HI>Turks, Jews, Arabs, Franks, Armenians, Greeks, Moors,</HI> and the Ancient Inhabitants, who have liberty to exerci&s;e their Religion as they plea&s;e, but have Mulcts &s;et upon them, for the <HI>Turks</HI> care not what they do in that nature, &s;o they can &s;crew Money out of them, they being, next to the <HI>Jews,</HI> the mo&s;t covetous of all People.

<P>BEING de&s;irous to vi&s;it the <HI>Holy Land,</HI> &s;o much Famed throughout the World, for the many Wonders God wrought there, and the many Me|morable and Venerable Antiquities yet to be &s;een. I provided my &s;elf of &s;uch Nece&s;&s;aries, as my Rea&s;on dictated, and as I was told I &s;hould &s;tand in need of. Upon Notice that a Caravan was ready to part, I went and enter'd my &s;elf one of the Company; &s;o every one having Notice, and being in a readine&s;s, we &s;et forward, but the Wind blowing hard, we had like to have been over-whelmed with Clouds of Sand rai&s;ed by it, which flying about our Ears, &s;poiled &s;ome of our Provi&s;ion; however, the Storm being over in 3 or 4 Hours, we kept on our way, with Timbrels Sounding, to chear the Cammels, that they might pur&s;ue their Journey with more A|lacrity. The fir&s;t place that offered it &s;elf to us, was <HI>Ithanque,</HI> a little Town, where the Caravan of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> makes its fir&s;t Stage; the next was <HI>Bal|beys,</HI> and from thence we proceeded, the next Day to <HI>Salabia,</HI> where are the plea&s;ant Woods of <HI>Tama|risk,</HI> and there we lay in Tents, &s;etting Guards, for fear of a &s;urprize from Robbers, lurking in tho&s;e Woods: Our Caravan con&s;i&s;ting of above 100 Camels, be&s;ides Mules, and Hor&s;es, with a con&s;i|derable &s;trength of Men, but no attempt was made;
<PB N="69" REF="41"> and the next Evening we reached <HI>Elbir Devedar,</HI> and encamped near &s;ome dirty Wells of Water, that our Bea&s;ts might be the better refre&s;hed; and then marched to <HI>Catice,</HI> where we had a Guard of <HI>Turks</HI> Armed, to conduct us to <HI>Riche,</HI> for now we were come within danger of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> and there I &s;aw a long Pit, of fine white Salt, which the Peo|ple affirmed was made only of Rain Water. We parted from thence, and went to <HI>Birlab,</HI> and hav|ing re&s;ted there, we journied to <HI>Bir Acat,</HI> a place in the De&s;art de&s;titute of Water, yet full of Quick|&s;ands; however, we were forced to lie there; but the next Day travelling on, we found a Well, called <HI>Sibile-El-Bar-Acat,</HI> made by an Aga, who pa&s;&s;ed that way in his Journey to <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> it is co|vered with a Dome, &s;upported by Pillars. This Water very much refre&s;hed us, and our Cattle; but going from hence we entered again into the Quick|&s;ands, which reach as far as <HI>Riche,</HI> and well it was we got to that place, for about a quarter of an Hour after a Storm aro&s;e, which la&s;ted about 30 Hours. This Village is not far from the Sea, and has a Ca|&s;tle built of little Rock Stones, as is likewi&s;e all the Hou&s;es of the Village; and here I ob&s;erved they had &s;o much Marble, that their Wells were made of that Stone, and their Burying-places are full of them. Having refre&s;hed our &s;elves, we departed for <HI>Cauniows,</HI> with a Guard of 8 <HI>Turks,</HI> and from thence we Travelled through Quick-&s;ands, though it Rained, Thundered, and blew hard, to <HI>Zaka,</HI> a place where no Hou&s;es are, for that Name was only given it from three Wells of Bracki&s;h Water we found there, but pa&s;&s;ing on, we came to Wells of plea&s;ant Water, and now we begun to have a pro&s;pect of a fine Country, where &s;ome Corn-Land appeared, which much encouraged us; there we found many plea&s;ant Trees, and good Meadows, &s;o that now we concluded we were on the Borders of the <HI>Land of Promi&s;e,</HI> and indeed we &s;oon reached the City of <HI>Gaza,</HI> which &s;tands about two Miles from the Sea, and was anciently very Stately and Famous for
<PB N="70" REF="42"> Trade; many of the Ancient Pillars are yet remain|ing, there being almo&s;t every where Marble Pillars to be &s;een; it was one of the five Lord&s;hips of the <HI>Philistins,</HI> the Gates of which <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> carried a|way on his Shoulders, and left them on a little Hill a Mile di&s;tant. Near the City there is a Ca&s;tle, with 4 corner Towers, and the Gates are of Iron: Hard by this are found lumps of ruined Walls, that cannot be broke with a Hammer, being the Ruins of a Ca&s;tle, built by the Ancient <HI>Romans;</HI> near the Ca&s;tle, behind the Burying-place, where we encamp|ed, &s;tood the Hou&s;e that <HI>Samp&s;on</HI> pulled down, when he by that means de&s;troyed &s;o many <HI>Phili|li&s;tines,</HI> and many other things of Note, which I had not time to ob&s;erve, by rea&s;on the Caravan was in ha&s;te to depart.</P>
<P>From <HI>Gaza</HI> we pa&s;&s;ed to a Village, called <HI>Megdel,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Ithan&s;edoud;</HI> all the way there are plea&s;ant Plains, full of Trees and Corn, and in the Sea&s;on the&s;e Plains are Embroidered with Tulips and E|monies, that grow without planting; &s;o pa&s;&s;ing a Village called <HI>Yebna,</HI> at the end of it we cro&s;&s;ed o|ver a Bridge, and from thence proceeded over love|ly Plains to <HI>Rama,</HI> and encamped in a Plain over-a|gain&s;t it; however, I went with a few others, to vi|&s;it &s;ome Merchants that re&s;ided there: This Town depends on the Ba&s;&s;a of <HI>Gaza.</HI> Here is the Hou&s;e of <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> now inhabited by French Merchants; there is al&s;o a pretty Church: The Church of the Forty Martyrs is in this Town. The Doors of the Hou&s;es are not above 3 Foot high, and they make them &s;o, on purpo&s;e to prevent the In&s;olent <HI>Arabs,</HI> that Border on them, from entring their Hou&s;es on Hor&s;eback: there is likewi&s;e a Church Dedicated to the Honour of St. <HI>George.</HI></P>
<P>Decamping from hence at 6 a Clock in the Morn|ing, we &s;aw, about 9, on our right Hand, the Vil|lage of <HI>Good Thief,</HI> called in <HI>Arabick, Bethlakij.</HI> Af|ter that we paid the Caffaire, or Cu&s;tom, and &s;o had a Guard allowed us to <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> but being l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">d about to avoid another Caffaire, we were en|tangled
<PB N="71" REF="42"> among the Mountains, and obliged to en|camp there, in a place clo&s;e by a ruinous old Build|ing, which had been a Convent of <HI>Franci&s;can</HI> Friars. Some Arches of the Ruins are yet &s;tanding above, and many others under Ground, where the <HI>Arabs</HI> keep a few Cows; a Spring of plea&s;ant Water i&s;&s;u|ing out of a Rock near it.</P>
<P>The next day, we pa&s;&s;ed on towards <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> once exceeding Famous, but now contracted into a &s;mall compa&s;s; we left <HI>Degib,</HI> a &s;mall Village, &s;o called in <HI>Arabick,</HI> and was once the Town of <HI>Samuel</HI> the Prophet; it &s;tands upon an Eminence, there is a Mo&s;que covered with a Dome, they &s;ay <HI>Samuel</HI> is Buried there, and the <HI>Jews</HI> vi&s;it it out of Devotion; and &s;oon after we di&s;covered the City of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> which the <HI>Turks</HI> call <HI>Coudscherif,</HI> and came before it, but being <HI>Franks,</HI> as they call the Latin Chri&s;tians, we could not be admitted till the Religious &s;ent for us; and when we had waited about an Hour, at that which is called the Gate of <HI>Dama&s;|cus,</HI> we were introduced by the Trucheman of the Convent, who came with an Officer belonging to the <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> of the Province, who vi&s;ited the Bagage, and then we were conducted to the Convent of St. <HI>Saviour,</HI> who Entertained us Charitably, and &s;hew|ed us to an Apartment were we might re&s;t our &s;elves, and a Monk came and wa&s;hed our Feet, and the Religious were very Indu&s;trious to &s;hew us the places of Note, and to begin our vi&s;its of the Holy Places. Fir&s;t we pa&s;&s;ed near to the <HI>Judgment Hall,</HI> from whence our Saviour went out bearing his Cro&s;s; it is &s;o called, becau&s;e, tho&s;e that were Condemned to die, went out of the City by it: At pre&s;ent within the City, advanced a few &s;teps, proceeding on our way, we pa&s;s under an Arch, where is a Stone on which they &s;ay, <HI>Pilate</HI> &s;et our Saviour, when he &s;aid, <HI>Ecce Homo, Behold the Man.</HI> This is a large Arch reaching from one &s;ide of the Street to the o|ther, and has two Windows looking into the Street, only &s;eparated by a little Marble Piller, and under this Window is an In&s;cription, <HI>viz. Tode Tolle Cru|cifice</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="43"> <HI>eum;</HI> Take and Crucifie him. A little fur|ther is the Palace of <HI>Herod,</HI> from whence our Savi|our was &s;ent back to <HI>Pilate,</HI> and although the&s;e two were at variance before, yet the Prince of Peace pa&s;&s;ing between them, they &s;oon, even that very day, were at Agreement: And indeed, there are many of the Antient Structures remaining, though this famous City has undergone &s;o many Revoluti|ons, yet it is Conjectur'd, that many new Works have been added to the Old Ruins, and they much repaired in many places. The <HI>Sheep Gate</HI> &s;till re|mains entire, and over the place where our Saviour was Scourged, there is a pretty Chaple Erected; the Front and &s;ome other parts of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Temple are yet remaining, and there are &s;everal Arches that make a lovely Porch before the Door of the Tem|ple; nor is the Tower of <HI>David</HI> quite defeated, there remaining many Ruins to &s;hew the Strength and Magnificence of it. There are abundance of Chaples in this City, &s;ome belonging to the <HI>La|tin Chri&s;tians,</HI> others to the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and &s;ome to <HI>Ar|menians Aba&s;ines,</HI> &amp;c. and the&s;e were rai&s;ed on &s;eve|ral Religious occa&s;ions, where the pa&s;&s;ages in Holy Scripture are recited to have hapned; but they pay the <HI>Turks</HI> a large tribute for po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them, yet they get much Money by the vi&s;its that are made in Pilgrimages, the <HI>Turks</HI> often choping and chang|ing with tho&s;e that will give mo&s;t Money, and they who are the riche&s;t, commonly po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e that are mo&s;t in Veneration, and con&s;equently mo&s;t frequen|ted; but above all the re&s;t that are very numerous, the Church of the Holy Sepulcher is in the highe&s;t Veneration, therefore I &s;hall briefly de&s;cribe it.</P>
<P>All <HI>Franks</HI> that enter it at fir&s;t, are taxed 24 Pia|&s;ters a piece, and the Religious pay only 12; but when you have once paid that Tax, and Entered it, you may go in as often as you will when it is open, giving a Mudine to the <HI>Turk,</HI> who keeps the Door.</P>
<P>Before you enter into the Church, you pa&s;s a kind of a large Court that is before it, laid with Free|&s;tone; and on this, the <HI>Jews</HI> do not, or, as &s;ome &s;ay,
<PB N="73" REF="43"> dare not tread: Then the Steeple appears, which is on the left &s;ide corner of the Front of the Church; it is &s;quare on all &s;ides, has three &s;tories of Win|dows, two in front, &s;upported and &s;eparated by two Marble Pillars, and heretofore is &s;aid to have 18 Bells in it. The Door of this Church is very Mag|nificent, and over it are many Figures in Bra&s;s Relicks, being the Repre&s;entations of &s;everal Sacred Hi&s;tories; the Door is &s;ealed with the Seal of the <HI>Ba&s;ha,</HI> and when any enter, it is immediately &s;hut again. In this Church, there is the Chaple of Ap|parition, &s;o called; becau&s;e it is held, our Lord ap|peared in that place to the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, imme|diately after his Re&s;urrection; and from thence we went down to the Chaple of St. <HI>Helena,</HI> Inventrix of the Cro&s;s, and having viewed &s;ome others, we pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;aid Chaple, where it was told the Women, that Chri&s;t was ri&s;en in this Chaple. There is a little Altar, and three Windows to give light before the Door, a Lamp, and &s;even Lamps within it, and there lies a Stone &s;aid to be rowled from the mouth of our Saviour's Sepulcher, on which the Angel &s;et, when his Brightne&s;s appear|ed &s;o tran&s;parent.</P>
<P>On the right hand as you enter, is the place where the Body of our Lord was laid in, cut out of the Rock, in which there is a Table of the &s;ame Rock rai&s;ed about two Foot from the Ground, or &s;omewhat more. This takes up one half of the Breadth, and the whole length of the Chaple; it has been faced with white Marble to prevent its be|ing broken, for the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> who came to vi&s;it it, &s;trove eagerly to have little Bits of it, to place in Rings and other Gold Ornaments as a precious Re|lick. And now it &s;erves for an Alter, where the La|tin Prie&s;ts celebrate Ma&s;s, none being permitted to do the like; and in the Roof of it are three Holes to evaporate the Smoak of the Lamps, there being 44 of them in it of Silver and Gold, &s;ent by the Kings of <HI>France, Spain,</HI> and other Princes. The in|&s;ide of this place is faced with White Marble, and
<PB N="74" REF="44"> environed on the out-&s;ide with 10 curious Pillars of the &s;ame Stone, and the Lamps are round about it. It is covered with a Plat-form in the middle, where|of ju&s;t over the Holes that Evaporate the Smoak, there is a Dome about 6 Foot in Height, covered with Lead, which &s;tands upon 12 little Porphery coloured Pillars, two and two on the Plat-form, which makes &s;ix Arches, and under every one of them hangs 3 Lamps; though when it runs, the Water falls through the Aizie in the Dome of the Church, on the little Dome, from whence it is con|veyed by a Pipe into a hole.</P>
<P>Before the Door of the Sepulcher, at an equal di|&s;tance from it, and the Door of the Quire, is a prodigeous Lump of Silver; they &s;ay, that two Men can hardly Fathom it, it was &s;ent by <HI>Philip</HI> III. of <HI>Spain,</HI> who&s;e Arms are on it in &s;everal places with this Motto: <HI>Philipus</HI> III. <HI>Rex Hi&s;paniorum me donavit.</HI></P>
<P>The Quire and the Body of the Church is of cu|rious Work; it is &s;aid to be placed in the middle of the World, becau&s;e in <HI>P&s;alm</HI> 74. its &s;aid, <HI>God wrought Salvation in the mid&s;t of the Earth,</HI> but not to be too tedious in this matter, I mu&s;t cut &s;hort and proceed to other places. We went &s;oon after to vi&s;it the Mount of <HI>Olives,</HI> the place where our Lord wept over <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and foretold its De&s;truction; and from thence indeed there is a curious pro&s;pect of the City. On the top of this Mount is the place of the A&s;cen&s;ion, where is a Chaple with 8 Fronts, and a little Dome covered with Lead, &s;upported by 8 Pillars of White Marble; in this Chaple is the print of a Foot on a piece of Rock, which they &s;ay, our Saviour left when he A&s;cended; and that there was an other of them which the <HI>Turks</HI> have cut a|way and kept to &s;hew to &s;uch as will give Money to &s;ee it in the Temple of <HI>Solomon.</HI> Then we vi&s;i|ted the <HI>Gzot,</HI> in which it is held the Apo&s;tles made the Creed, and the Sepulchers of <HI>Ab&s;alon</HI> and <HI>Jeho|&s;aphat;</HI> the Valley wherein they &s;tand is no other now, than a great Ditch, that conveys the Water
<PB N="75" REF="44"> from <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> but the chief <HI>Jews</HI> hire their Bury|ing Places here of the <HI>Turks,</HI> &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly fancy|ing, that Judgment will fir&s;t begin here at the gene|ral Re&s;urrection, and therefore they who are Buri|ed in it, &s;hall be fir&s;t di&s;patched. About <HI>Ab&s;alon</HI>'s Tomb is a great heap of Stones, for every one that pa&s;&s;es by, is obliged to throw a Stone at it, in de|te&s;tation of his Rebellion again&s;t his Father.</P>
<P>Near this, there is the Tomb of <HI>Zacharias,</HI> and the Brook <HI>Kedron;</HI> this Brook has over it a Stone-Bridge, but many times it is dry, as it hapned at this time, &s;o that we pa&s;&s;ed over without wetting our Feet, though not near the Bridg.</P>
<P>As for the Garden of <HI>Olives,</HI> it is a very &s;mall place, and few Trees remaining in it; it is inclo&s;ed with a very incon&s;iderable Wall, and into it is ta|ken the Garden of <HI>Beth&s;emany,</HI> where our Saviour was in his Agony, and near it is the Sepulcher of of the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> which is a Church al|mo&s;t under ground, of it, nothing but the Front can be &s;een, and hereabouts are &s;everal other Sepulchers to be &s;een, as tho&s;e of <HI>Joachin</HI> and <HI>Anna,</HI> and the place where St. <HI>Stephen</HI> was Stoned; &s;o entering by St. <HI>Stephen</HI>'s Gate, we came to the <HI>Sheep-pool,</HI> which is near to <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Temple; and here are yet to be &s;een the Sepulchers of <HI>Godfrey</HI> of <HI>Bulloin,</HI> the fir&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> King of <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> that of his Brother <HI>Balwin,</HI> and others that &s;ucceeded him, though time has much defaced &s;ome of them. From hence I went to Mount <HI>Calvery,</HI> where is a Hole half a foot Diameter, and 2 foot Deep, in which the <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> there &s;ay, the Cro&s;s &s;tood when our Saviour was Crucified; they &s;hewed a Rock, with a cleft in it, that they &s;ay rent at his giving up the Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>My curio&s;ity now led me to vi&s;it the Burying Places of the Kings of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> which is of great Antiquity; and to this you go out of the City by the Gates of <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> and when I came there, I entered into a great Court, cut out and made even in a Rock, and the Rock &s;erves to it as a Wall; and on the left hand there is a Gallery cut out of the &s;ame
<PB N="76" REF="45"> Rock, with &s;everal Pillars beautified with Stone, Embeli&s;hed with curious Figures, and Engravenings on Stone; and there is a little open place at one end of this Gallery, through which I crept on my Hands and Knees, and then found a large &s;quare Room cut out of the Rock; and further there are o|ther Rooms, and curious &s;quare Tombs cut out of the Rock al&s;o, &s;o that it &s;eem'd a Palace rather than a Burying place, though here many of the Antient Kings of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> lye Interr'd; and returning from this Magnificent Palace of the Dead, I went to vi|&s;it the Cave, where, it is held, the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> compo&s;ed his Lamentations. It is a large light&s;ome <HI>Grot,</HI> the Roof of it &s;upported by a Pillar that &s;tands in the mid&s;t of it, being very near the Burying Place of the Kings.</P>
<P>Having been curious in making the&s;e Ob&s;ervati|ons, I had a de&s;ire to &s;ee the famous River <HI>Jordan,</HI> &s;o renowned in Holy Writ; and &s;o taking Provi&s;i|on for the way, and Company al&s;o to guard us a|gain&s;t the in&s;ults of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> who watch all oppor|tunities to rob Strangers and <HI>Turks;</HI> We &s;et forward with a great many more that had the &s;ame de&s;ire, and joyning with us in our way, lay almo&s;t all a|long among the Mountains, the Road being very Stony from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to the Plains of <HI>Jerico;</HI> before the latter, our Caravan, as we may Term it, En|camped, having pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Bithany,</HI> and the Fountain of the Apo&s;tles. Here we refre&s;hed our &s;elves, and though <HI>Jerico</HI> was once a famous City, it now con|&s;i&s;ts of a few Brick Hou&s;es, inhabited by <HI>Arabs,</HI> who live a mi&s;erable poor life; near to this is the Hou&s;e of <HI>Zacheus,</HI> and here we found the &s;o much talked of Ro&s;es of <HI>Jerico;</HI> the&s;e Blow not unle&s;s they are put into Water, and then they Blow in all Sea&s;ons, contrary to the Opinions of tho&s;e who &s;ay they blow not but on <HI>Chri&s;tmas Day,</HI> and others on all the Fe&s;tivals of our Lady.</P>
<P>Travelling by many places of little Note, at length we came to <HI>Jordan,</HI> and Encamped near it: On the Banks there are many Almond, and other
<PB N="77" REF="45"> plea&s;ant Trees; it is not broader than the <HI>Thames,</HI> but very deep in mo&s;t places, it has its beginning from 2 &s;mall Springs, called <HI>Jor,</HI> and <HI>Dan,</HI> towards Mount <HI>Libanus,</HI> and from them, put together, it takes its Name. The Water of this River, they &s;ay, will not corrupt by length of time, though it ap|pears not very clear: It runs from <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>South,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing through the Sea of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> lo&s;es its Wa|ters in the <HI>A&s;phalian</HI> Lake, or <HI>Dead Sea,</HI> which &s;prung up in the Plains, when the Cities of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorah</HI> were &s;unk in Flames; in the Sylvian places, on the Bank of this River, the warbling of Birds is very Harmonious, e&s;pecially of Nightingals, who are there in great numbers. At this River ma|ny paid their Devotions, in remembrance of the Wonders that had been done there; as the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI>'s pa&s;&s;ing it dry &s;hod: <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI>'s, dividing it with his Mantle; and our Saviour's being Baptized.</P>
<P>As for the Dead Sea, it is a great &s;tanding Lake of Salt and Bitter Water; all the Plains that border on it are Bitter, and they &s;ay there are Trees grow|ing on the brink of it, that bear Apples with a Scar|let and Golden Rhine, fair to the Eye to delude Travellers, but as a Cur&s;e on the Place, they are within, A&s;hes and Smoke. Some hold, that a living thing will not &s;ink in this Water, but the fumes a|ri&s;ing from it were &s;o extream it being hot Weather, that I thought it convenient not to approach too near it. I was informed that this Sea, or rather Lake, was 100 Miles in length, and 25 over, but that no Fi&s;h can live in it. In our return, I &s;aw the Mount where our Saviour Fa&s;ted Forty Days, and was Tempted; on the top of it there is a Grot, wherein is an Altar: This Grot is &s;aid to be the place of his Re&s;idence, during that time, and there the Monks &s;ay Ma&s;s on publick occa&s;ions; and com|ing down again, I &s;aw the Prophet <HI>Eli&s;ha</HI>'s Well, where he made the Bitter Water Sweet, by ca&s;ting Salt into it; and now the Water is of an excellent plea&s;ant Ta&s;t; This Well is about a quarter of an Hours Travel from the Foot of the Mountain.</P>

<P>Having re&s;ted a little after this Journey, and e&s;ca|ped &s;ome Ambu&s;hcades of the <HI>Arabs,</HI> I, as well as many more of my Companions, being de&s;irous to &s;ee other memorable places before we left the <HI>Holy-Land,</HI> our curio&s;ity lead us to pa&s;s through the Gate of <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> which we did, pretty early in the Morning, and the fir&s;t thing of Note that &s;aluted our Eyes, was the Foot of Mount <HI>Sion,</HI> on the Right Hand, and the two Fi&s;h-Ponds of <HI>Ber&s;heba,</HI> in one of which, <HI>David</HI> beheld her bathing from his Pallace in Mount <HI>Sion,</HI> when he fell enamour'd with her, and committed that grievous Sin, which made not only him but all <HI>I&s;rael</HI> Mourn. Then we pa&s;|&s;ed to the Field which is called <HI>Acaldema,</HI> or <HI>the Field of Blood,</HI> and here the <HI>Armenian</HI> Strangers find a Burying-place: &s;o going forward, we &s;aw the Grot where 8 of the Apo&s;tles hid them&s;elves, when our Lord was made a Pri&s;oner; it is now a plea&s;ant cool place for &s;helter, and in it are to be &s;een the Pi|ctures of the Apo&s;tles.

<P>But going on, we came to the Pool of <HI>Shilo,</HI> where the Blind Man wa&s;hed, and had his &s;ight re&s;tored him, and pa&s;&s;ing on, &s;aw where the Prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> was &s;awn a&s;under with a wooden Saw, by the com|mand of <HI>Mana&s;&s;es.</HI> Then we journied by the Foun|tain

Here is the Room he entred when the Doors were &s;hut, and the Holy Gho&s;t de&s;cended on the Day of Pentico&s;t.</P>
<P>Not far from hence we beheld the Sepulchers of <HI>David,</HI> and <HI>Solomon.</HI> This Mountain was formerly within the compa&s;s of the Walls of <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> but <HI>Selim</HI> the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Sultan rebuilding them, it was ex|cluded, and the City much &s;treightned.

<P>And now returning a little again to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> I &s;hall give &s;omewhat more of its De&s;cription than hitherto I have done.</P>
<P>This Famous City is &s;eated on a Barren Mounta|nous Ground for the mo&s;t part, it produces no
<PB N="81" REF="47"> Food, but at a di&s;tance the Land is exceeding Fer|tile. The Streets are narrow and crooked, the Building but indifferent, all the Ancient Magnifi|cence being in a manner laid in Rubbi&s;h; it has 6 Gates, <HI>viz.</HI> That of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> the Gates of <HI>Bethle|hem, Jaffa, Dama&s;cus, Zion,</HI> and the <HI>Dungate,</HI> and one that is walled up, called the <HI>Golden-Gate,</HI> becau&s;e our Saviour entered in Triumph at it; the <HI>Sheep-Gate</HI> is not reckoned, as being much ruined.

The Walls of this City are fair and &s;trong.</P>
<P>Again, leaving <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> I went with a con&s;ide|rable Company to vi&s;it <HI>Emans,</HI> and <HI>Jaffa;</HI> the fir&s;t of the&s;e is but 2 Leagues and an half from <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem;</HI> by the way &s;tands the Well where our Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2+ letters"> appeared to the two Di&s;ciples, after his Re&s;urre|ction; a little further is the Ca&s;tle where our Lord was known to them in breaking Bread, which is now very ruinous, and the Village is of little ac|count, there being very few Hou&s;es, and tho&s;e in|con&s;iderable, which made us keep on by the way of <HI>Ramah</HI> to <HI>Jaffa,</HI> which is 4 Leagues beyond it: This <HI>Jaffa</HI> was Anciently called <HI>Joppa.</HI> It is built on the Top of a Rock, and is altogether Ruinous, there remaining no more than &s;ome Towers, and the Port at the Foot of the Rock; and to a crag of
<PB N="82" REF="48"> this Rock it is Fabled, <HI>Andromeda</HI> was tied, when <HI>Per&s;eus</HI> the Son of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and <HI>Danae</HI> delivered her from the Sea Mon&s;ter.

There are Grots by the Sea-&s;ide for Pilgrims to re&s;t in; there is al&s;o a little Ca&s;tle, with two Towers, one round the o|ther, &s;quare, and a great Tower &s;eparated from it on one &s;ide, but no Hou&s;es by the Sea. The Port has but little Water in it, and none but &s;mall Barks can come up with the Fortre&s;&s;es. Mount <HI>Carmell</HI> being but a little di&s;tance from hence, by Water, I agreed with others, to take &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els to vi&s;it it, but we met with a Storm by the way, that much endangered us; but at length we arrived &s;afely there, and lodged in the Village of <HI>Cayplias,</HI> which, by the Ruins appears to have been formerly a con&s;ide|rable Town, it is at the Foot of the Mountain, and the next Morning we a&s;cended the Mountain, where we found a Convent of bare-footed Fryars, called <HI>Carmelites;</HI> the&s;e ob&s;erve a very &s;trict Rule, neither eating Fle&s;h nor drinking Wine, totally Se|que&s;tring them&s;elves from the World, nor will they &s;uffer others to do it in their Convent. This is the place where the Prophet <HI>Elias</HI> lived; and there is in this Mount, as they &s;ay, a Garden of Stone Mellons, which happened on this wi&s;e; the Prophet asking the Man to give him &s;ome of that he was gathering, he to put him off, told him they were Stones, when immediately they proved &s;o indeed, by turning in|to Stone; they &s;hewed us one of the&s;e, but would not &s;hew us the place where they grew, lea&s;t we &s;hould covet to carry them away; however, they fea&s;ted us with Fruits, boiled Roots, and gave us Water to Drink; for though the Hill is Rockey, ye by their indu&s;try, they have rai&s;ed many Fruit-Trees, and have variety of good Flowers. Then we &s;aw the Well <HI>Elias</HI> made to &s;pring out of the Ground, and another little Well by it; we &s;aw a little di&s;tant from the&s;e, the Grot, or Cave of <HI>Elias</HI>

<P>I forgot to tell you of Mount <HI>Libanus,</HI> &s;o famed for its tall Cedars, but &s;uch wa&s;t has been made of them, that I could number great and &s;mall but 23.

<P>HAving heard many Famous Things reported of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> too many here to enumerate; and be|ing recruited with Bills of Exchange, and other Advantages for Travelling, it being a curio&s;ity I was enclined too from my tender Years, I found an opportunity to go in good Company for <HI>Dama&s;cus.</HI> This City is &s;till in good Reputation, and has &s;ix Gates, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Ea&s;t Gate,</HI> the <HI>Sphaies,</HI> or <HI>Seraglio Gate,</HI> the <HI>Shoo Gate,</HI> the Gate of <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> the Gate of <HI>Peace,</HI> and St. <HI>Thomas's Gate:</HI> This City is an Hour and a quarters walk round it; but the Suburbs are as big again as the Town.

I, and &s;ome of the Company, pa&s;&s;ed by Water on a Keleck, or a kind of a Float, fa&s;tned on a great many Leather Baggs, filled full of Wind; but they would not &s;uffer us to carry any Wine on Board, fooli&s;hly fancying, that it would fink their Boat; and in this we did wi&s;ely, for we afterwards heard of many that pa&s;&s;ed by Land, who were not accu&s;tomed to that Wind, di|ed, being &s;tifled or Poy&s;oned with the infectious Air. In our Pa&s;&s;age we &s;aw many Towns and Vil|lages; and Men, Women, and Cattle were &s;wim|ing their Pa&s;&s;age over the River. In the Night we heard the Lions Roar on either Hand, which made us keep from the Shoar, lea&s;t they &s;hould leap into our Kelechs, though the Natives would per&s;wade us, they were afraid of a Man, and that the <HI>Arabs</HI> u&s;ually pur&s;ued and killed them with a Staff; but we thought fit not to lay too much &s;tre&s;s upon this, for I had heard in <HI>Mo&s;ul,</HI> that many who had &s;trag|led from the Caravans, had been &s;naped by them, for they rove in great numbers, and Fire-Arms are the be&s;t defence again&s;t them; be&s;ides, we were forced to &s;tand on our Guard, for fear of the Thievei&s;h <HI>Arabs,</HI> who often get aboard by &s;wiming, and &s;urpri&s;e the&s;e Kelechs, nor did they fail to A|larum us, but when we e&s;pied them, they Dived, and got to Shoar, and by that means e&s;caped our Shot we made at them: But to be Brief, at la&s;t we came to <HI>Bagdad.</HI> This is a long Town, lying on the River: The fir&s;t thing that appears is the Ca|&s;tle, to the &s;ide of the River, on the left Hand, and &s;eems to be very well Fortified. It is built of
<PB N="87" REF="50"> curious white Stone, though the generality of the Hou&s;es in the Town are low and incon&s;iderable; it is very &s;trong on the Land-&s;ide, and in circuit Large, requiring at lea&s;t two Hours to compa&s;s it, at a moderate pace on Foot; there are lovely Bagnios, and fair Bazars in it. It was Founded by the <HI>Per|&s;ians,</HI> but taken from them by the <HI>Turks,</HI> and has a Ba&s;&s;a for their Governor. It &s;tands advantageous enough on the <HI>Tygris,</HI> but is thinly Peopled, by rea|&s;on of the Licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the Soldiers, who are &s;carcely under any Command.</P>
<P>It is extream Hot in this place in the Summer time, as in all others of the &s;ame Latitude. There are but few Fruit-Trees hereabouts, but every where &s;tore of Licorice. They generally u&s;e Oyl of <HI>Naphta</HI> in their Lamps, it being plentiful in their Borders. They often &s;end their Expre&s;&s;es from place to place by Carrier Pidgeons, fa&s;tning the Note about their Necks, which they exactly per|form, unle&s;s they are killed by the way, which rarely happens.</P>
<P>I found here a Caravan, mo&s;tly con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>Per|&s;ians,</HI> bound for <HI>Hamaden</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> this opportu|nity I and others embraced, though we found the Retinue did not exceed &s;ixty, &s;lenderly Armed, and mo&s;tly without Tents, appearing re&s;olute and hardy; and pa&s;&s;ing <HI>Caranluocapi,</HI> leaving on the left the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tower <HI>Adgdadom Coula&s;u,</HI> we came near <HI>Lock|man Hakin,</HI> and encamped there all Day, where the <HI>Chakales</HI> entertained us with Mu&s;ick: From thence we Marched, and Lodged in a Village, called <HI>Aacube,</HI> under the plea&s;ant Shade of divers &s;preading Palm-Trees, and &s;o proceeded Ea&s;tward to <HI>Harounia,</HI> where are many plea&s;ant Gardens, and pa&s;&s;ing by <HI>Adiga</HI> and <HI>Immanisker,</HI> and many other Villages, we were informed the <HI>Arabs</HI> lay in wait for us in the narrow Pa&s;&s;es, which cau&s;ed us to get 15 Jani|&s;aries well Armed; but we needed them not, meet|ing with no oppo&s;ition, for we &s;afely arrived at <HI>Mendeli,</HI> the utmo&s;t bounds of the <HI>Turks,</HI> on the Frontiers of <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> It is a little Town and Ca&s;tle

<HEAD>CHAP. VII. <HI>Travels into</HI> Per&s;ia, <HI>and a particular Ac|count of the Places, and what occured in the way to</HI> I&s;pahan, <HI>the Metropolis of the Kingdom.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE famous Kingdom of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> &s;o much Re|nowned in Hi&s;tory, is the Anciente&s;t Monar|chy now known in the World, having, for the mo&s;t part, had an interrupted Succe&s;&s;ion of Kings, who have Govern'd that va&s;t Region Valliantly, in wi&s;e Conduct, and much Glory.</P>
<P>It is bounded on the Ea&s;t with the great River <HI>Indus,</HI> on the South with the main Ocean, on the North with the <HI>Ca&s;pian-Sea,</HI> and on the We&s;t with the <HI>Tygris</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian-Gulf,</HI> and is divided into 11 Provinces, <HI>viz. Per&s;is,</HI> now called <HI>Far, Su&s;iana, Ca|ramania, Gedro&s;&s;o, Drangiania, Irica, Aracho&s;&s;a, Pa|rapomi&s;us, Seccha, Hircania,</HI> and <HI>Ormus;</HI> all very large, and mo&s;t of them Fertile.</P>
<P>On the confines of this Kingdom, we found Men Armed with Bows and Quivers, who &s;topped us, becau&s;e we were advanced before the Caravan, but being certified that we belonged to it, they let us pa&s;s. The&s;e are the King's Officers, &s;et on the Roads to examine Strangers, thereby to prevent Spys and Robbers entring into the Country, and are upon mo&s;t Roads, having a pretty good Sallary out of the Trea&s;ury for their diligence; and they get much Money of Pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e Men, we Travelled &s;ome|times over Plains, then Hills, and then into Plains
<PB N="89" REF="51"> again, and through many narrow Pa&s;&s;ages, &s;eeing on either Hand a very fruitful Country, and the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI>'s Hou&s;es, many of them being made of Cane, and built &s;traglingly here and there; we often chang|ed the Point, &s;ometimes North, or Ea&s;t, or South-Ea&s;t, as the way led us, till we came by a Village of <HI>Cures,</HI> called <HI>Nian;</HI> the Hills about it were co|vered with Turpentine, and wild Che&s;nut-Trees; the Waters bordered with <HI>Agnus Ca&s;tus,</HI> and Ro&s;e-Laurels. Here the Weather altered, for it was very Cold in compari&s;on of the Hot Countries we had pa&s;&s;ed before. From hence we pa&s;&s;ed to a Vil|lage, called <HI>Chegiafer,</HI> it is compo&s;ed of &s;tragling Hou&s;es, of rough Stone, Earth, Cane, and Reeds, covered with green Branches; the former are their Summer-Hou&s;es, and the latter their Winter-Hou&s;es. Their Mo&s;ques in this place are built of rough Stone and Earth, and on the way there are many Kervan&s;erais commodious to Inn at, very fine for the mo&s;t part, being beautified with a kind of black Stone, &s;ome polli&s;hed and &s;ome rough; but pa&s;&s;ing on through a va&s;t track of Country, we came to <HI>Hamadan,</HI> to which place the Caravan was bound.</P>
<P><HI>Hamadan</HI> is a large Town, but in many places of it void &s;paces, there being many Gardens and Ploughed Fields within the Walls; the Hou&s;es are Stately, yet built of Brick baked in the Sun: It has one fair Street, where they &s;ell Stuffs and Cloaths ready made; it has many Shops in it, and lies near the <HI>Beze&s;tein</HI> which is little, but well compacted; and indeed it is a Town of a pretty Trade, many Caravans coming thither out of <HI>Turkey,</HI> and other parts, to buy and &s;ell Merchandize, though the Air and Water are unwhol&s;ome, and no Wine to be found, &s;o that I was very ill there, which made me ha&s;ten to be gone to a more agreeable Air. It is Commanded by a Cham, under the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who is the &s;ame there, as a Ba&s;&s;a in <HI>Turkey.</HI> The <HI>Armenians</HI> have a Church here, but keep it in no good Order: To this and other Chams the King e|very Year &s;ends a Rich Ve&s;t, who go out of the
<PB N="90" REF="52"> Gate to receive it, and return with it on, without a|ny other Ceremony, then being attended by the chief Men of the place on Hor&s;eback, and this is u&s;ually Cloth of Gold.</P>
<P>From hence we took Mules with our Lading, for five Aba&s;is a piece, and one of the&s;e will carry 600 weight, if need requires it; and &s;o taking leave of tho&s;e of the Caravan that &s;taid to negotiate their Affairs, we &s;et forward for <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> the Regal City of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and Metropolis of the Kingdom, in a ve|ry &s;trong Troop; for though &s;uch care has been ta|ken, that Robberies are le&s;s frequented in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> than in <HI>Turkey,</HI> yet it is prudence, however, to be armed again&s;t Danger, and pa&s;&s;ing early in the Morning through the King's Gate, &s;o called, be|cau&s;e it looks towards the Royal City: We Travel|ed over Hills and Downs, the way often altering, from good to bad, till we came to the Town of <HI>Ni&s;char,</HI> where we refre&s;hed our &s;elves in a ruinous Kervan&s;erai, on the Ground, where Carpets were &s;pread, and drank Water out of a leathern Jugg, called there a Matera: From thence we Marched along the River &s;ide, and came to lodg at another Village called <HI>Boulou&s;ch Ki&s;ar,</HI> and the next Day en|camped under Trees near <HI>Haran,</HI> another Village, where we were warned by our Muliters, to keep a good Guard in the Night time, for they told us, Spys had been among&s;t us that Day, to vi&s;it our Arms, and &s;ee how we were provided; but whe|ther they liked them not, or &s;tood in fear, I know not; but certain it is, we had there no di&s;turbance.</P>
<P>Early in the Morning we marched again, and pa&s;&s;ed by &s;everal plea&s;ant Villages and Gardens, and foarding the little River <HI>Dizava,</HI> we came to a Town of that Name, lying among&s;t Gardens, in a &s;pacious Plain, and here we had a plentiful &s;hower of Rain, which was the fir&s;t, except a little mizling in our way, &s;ince my departure from <HI>Aleppo;</HI> and &s;o by a long Journey, taking in our way <HI>Sari, Debi|le, Moucha&s;aba, Machat, Scheber-Gird, Angovan, Agatch,</HI> or <HI>Far&s;ang, Nichova, Faga&s;un, Ithua, Ghul|paigan,</HI>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. <HI>A De&s;cription of</HI> I&s;pahan, <HI>in what is curious and worthy of Remark in it.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>ISpahan,</HI> as I told you, is the Principality, and &s;tands in the Province of <HI>Iraca,</HI> part of the An|cient <HI>Parthia:</HI> Here the Air is Dry, Plea&s;ant, and more whol&s;ome than in many other parts, which is one main Rea&s;on the King u&s;ually keeps his Court here. This City was Anciently called, <HI>Hecatompolis,</HI> being Recorded to have had 100 Gates. It is beau|tified with Walls of a great heighth, built of a red kind of a Marble; and though the Hou&s;es are very Stately, they are built with Brick baked in the Sun, daubed over with a fine Clay, mingled with Straw, and white ca&s;t over with a very fine Plai&s;ter, which is made of a Stone got out of the Neighbour|ing Mountains and burned to that whitene&s;s, this Plai&s;ter is the third part of the Charge of building a Hou&s;e; they burn their Tiles indeed in a Kiln, but they are not &s;o la&s;ting as ours. There is in this Ci|ty many very &s;tately Mo&s;ques, curiou&s;ly adorned; al&s;o &s;undry Pallaces, Seraglios, and Buildings of great Antiquity, but many of the mo&s;t Ancient are Ruinous. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> take great delight in their Hou&s;es, keeping them very neat, and adorning them with curious Paintings, Carpets, and Tape|&s;try; for in the&s;e, and their Gardens, &s;eem to con|&s;i&s;t
<PB N="92" REF="53"> their greate&s;t Pride. The Walls of this City will take 5 or 6 Hours, at a pretty round pace, on Foot, to compa&s;s them; becau&s;e, within them there are &s;pacious Gardens, adorned with plea&s;ant Flow|ers, and delicious Fruit-Trees, &s;erved by Aqua|ducts that run there in Chanels, watering and Fru|ctifying the &s;everal quarters; and in tho&s;e Gardens are artificial Mounts, bedded with Flowers and plea|&s;ant Summer-hou&s;es on the top of them, &s;haded with Trees, be&s;ides many &s;tately Pallaces; and the quarter where the&s;e are, is called the New Town. The Suburbs of this City are very large, and the Nobles have Pallaces in it, e&s;pecially in <HI>Golfa,</HI> ly|ing beyond the River <HI>Sendera,</HI> which is mo&s;tly in|habited by <HI>Armenians,</HI> tran&s;planted by <HI>Sheba Abba,</HI> a <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Sultan, when he utterly razed their Town of that Name in <HI>Armenia.</HI> About this great City are cantoned People of divers other Nations; and there is hardly any Country in <HI>Europe, A&s;ia,</HI> or <HI>A|frica,</HI> but there are Natives of them to be found here.</P>
<P>In this City there are many Squares, which ren|der it lovely; the greate&s;t of which, is that of <HI>Mei|dan;</HI> it has regular Piazza's, and is about 700 com|mon Paces in length, and near 300 in breadth; it is built round, and the Hou&s;es are all in the form of Porticoes; over them is a &s;econd range of Arches, more backward, and the&s;e &s;erve for Galleries and Pa&s;&s;ages, the Hou&s;es being all of an equal heighth, give a curious Pro&s;pect: There is a plea&s;ant Canal near it, bordered with Palm-Trees, and fed by a Spring, at the end of which is a Bell, &s;aid to be taken out of a Nunnery in <HI>Ormus,</HI> with this In&s;crip|tion, <HI>Ave</HI> Maria <HI>Gratia plena. Hail</HI> Mary <HI>full of Grace.</HI> Hither the Mu&s;icians re&s;ort, there being a Gallery, and &s;ound &s;everal In&s;truments to divert the People, e&s;pecially in the Night time, and a|mong&s;t others, a Trumpet of Copper, which is 8 Foot long, making a &s;trong hoars &s;ound, and may be heard in a &s;till Night all over the City, being al|mo&s;t in proportion, like a &s;peaking Trumpet,
<PB N="93" REF="53"> Pa&s;&s;ing on to the Right, or We&s;t &s;ide, is the Gate of <HI>Aly,</HI> their great Prophet; on the Thre&s;hold of it, which is a round Stone, the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> out of a Ve|neration for the place, will not tread on; and if Malefactors can e&s;cape into the Court beyond it, or in the King's Stables, or Kitchin, they are in a Sanctuary, none daring to remove them from thence. This Gate is plain, and guarded by Sofies-men of great account there, and many <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> out of De|votion, kneel and ki&s;s the Three&s;hold e'er they pa&s;s over it.</P>
<P>The Street of <HI>Techebarbag,</HI> or the four Gardens, is very large, near 100 Paces broad, and about 2 <HI>Itallion</HI> Miles in length: There is a by way into it from the King's Pallace, through narrow Pa&s;&s;ages as it were a Curtain; its watered with a Canal, and adorned with &s;hadowing Plan-Trees, being divided by the River <HI>Senderu,</HI> over which is a curious Bridge of Stone, with a Gallery, covered and rai&s;ed a|bove the Level for Foot Pa&s;&s;engers; its about 300 Paces long, and 20 broad, founded on many Ar|ches, &s;ome Brick, edged with Free-Stone, and others all of Stone. Over the Gallery there is a Platform, giving a fine Pro&s;pect of the River, and other places, the Gallery &s;erves likewi&s;e for a Hor&s;e-way in the Winter, for then the overflowing of the Ri|ver fills up the middle of the Bridge, and renders it a kind of a Canal. The Gates of the King's Pallace, and the Front of it, gives a good Pro&s;pect, as do the Mo&s;ques, being adorned with Domes, and other Beautifyings; but the Chri&s;tians are forbid|den to enter, under the Penalty of gro&s;s affronts, if not a good Cudgeling, though &s;ome of them out of curio&s;ity do it in <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Habits, mingling them&s;elve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the re&s;t, and &s;o pa&s;s undi&s;tingui&s;hed, among&s;t which I took my Lot, and &s;aw their curious Ciel|ings, Paintings, Mo&s;aick-Work, fine Marble, and many other curious things. As for their Burying|places they are without the City, and &s;o they are in all the Cities of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<PB N="94" REF="54">
<P> They have a curious way to &s;ecure the hot Air in &s;ultry Weather, <HI>viz.</HI> They have on the tops of their Hou&s;es a Wall about 2 Fathom high, and as much in breadth, to which, at the intervals of o|ther Walls of about a Foot broad, and as high as the fir&s;t, are joyned in right Angels, and the&s;e are covered with a Roof, &s;o that let the Wind blow which way it will, the Air being pre&s;&s;ed between 3 Walls, is driven through a hole in the Roof of the Hou&s;e, and diffu&s;es coolbreathings, cool breathings, but in Win|ter this hole is &s;topped.</P>
<P>This City is full of Arti&s;ts, and each Company pays the King a certain Sum, which they rai&s;e again upon all the Crafts, and they are very dextrous in their &s;everal Handicrafts, in which, principally, con&s;i&s;ts the riches of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>In the King's Court the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Language is mo&s;t|ly &s;poke, but much differing from what is &s;poke at <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> this di&s;tingui&s;hes the Courtiers from the re&s;t of the People, and gives them certain Au|thorities and Preeminencies they affect, for they co|vet Honour above all things, and are profu&s;e in their Diet, Habit, Hou&s;es, and Equipages, which renders many Noble Families Poor. Their Equi|page in Travelling is extraordinary. They &s;moak much Tobacco, and u&s;ually do it through a Ve&s;&s;el of Water. Their Games are chiefly Che&s;s, and Draughts, which they u&s;e in their Vi&s;its. There are among&s;t them a great many Mathematicians, and A&s;trologers, and the King maintains many hun|dreds of them liberally, though mo&s;t of them ap|pear to be very ignorant: However, the&s;e are their chief Studies. They have al&s;o Dreamers among them, who pretend to &s;ee and foretel things that way.</P>
<P>If a Man has killed another, the Widow, or next Relation, demands the &s;atisfaction of his Blood, and if it be not made up for Money, the Murthe|rer, if taken, is delivered to the Pro&s;ecutor, who puts him to Death with great Torments, e&s;pecially if he falls into the Hands of a Woman, for they
<PB N="65" REF="54"> are more cruel here than the Men; and though they often compound, yet the Relations that are not con&s;enting to it, will privately revenge the Blood of their Friend, concluding, their Honour &s;uffers if the Murtherer e&s;capes unpuni&s;hed.</P>
<P>If any one has been Robbed, he mu&s;t make a pre|&s;ent to the <HI>Deroga,</HI> who is the &s;ame in Office, with the Sons, or Sub-Ba&s;&s;a, in the Turki&s;h Government. He &s;ends his Men abroad to take up &s;u&s;pected Per|&s;ons, and puts them to the Rack to make them con|fe&s;s, and if the Goods be recovered, he takes a tenth, and &s;ometimes a &s;ixth part; but he &s;eems to be kinder to the <HI>Franks,</HI> taking only a pre&s;ent of them, though may times by concealing the di&s;covery, he cheats them of all.</P>
<P>As for the Habits of the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> they are more gaudy than &s;ub&s;tantial or la&s;ting, generally waring flower'd Silks, or Callicoes, quilted Coats, and the like, having a flowing loo&s;e Garment over a clo&s;e Coat, or Wa&s;tcoat, with a Girdle; their Drawers down to their Heels, their Stockings are of Cloth, wide and big; their Shoos are like Womens Slip|pers, with high Heels, peaked at the Toes with a bit of Iron, but &s;o &s;hort, that mo&s;t part of the Heel hangs over, though they &s;tick clo&s;e, and are covered with Shagreen. They ware Turbans very large, and of divers colours, except the Moulla's, who are Priviledged to wear them white, though the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> ware Caps with little Turbans about them, and the better &s;ort have them embroidered with Gold and Silver. They take a Pride to have every piece of their Apparrel of a different colour, and affect neatne&s;s. As for Rings, the Men, nay, the King him&s;elf wears Silver ones, but the Wo|men tho&s;e of Gold, though they cannot give any rea&s;on for this di&s;tinction. They paint their Hands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with a Dye, called <HI>Hanna,</HI> and will not &s;uffer their Beards to grow long, as the <HI>Turks</HI> do, for they clip them to a quarter of an Inch, and take care to have large Mu&s;tachoes.</P>
<PB N="96" REF="55">
<P> The Women go vailed all to their Eyes, and the Bridegoom never &s;ees his Bride bare-faced till the Wedding Night. They wear Gold Rings in their No&s;es, their No&s;trils being boared for that purpo&s;e, which is a mark of Servitude, though they take it for a Pride. When they ride, they are placed on a Cammel, in Ca&s;chave, where they are as ea&s;ie as in a Chair. They &s;it at their Banquets, and other|ways, as the Men do, cro&s;s-legged, on Carpets &s;pread on the Ground, or on Cu&s;hions, and lie on Quilts in their Smocks and Drawers, but have curi|ous fine painted Coverlids over them.</P>
<P>They eat but &s;paringly, and wonder the <HI>Franks</HI> can eat Meat twice a Day, they doing it but once, and then they mo&s;tly Boyl or Bake their Meats, not much approving of Roa&s;tmeat; nor indeed they do not eat much Fle&s;h, living mo&s;tly on Rice-broth, Herbs, and Fruits. They burn Oyl of <HI>Napta</HI> in their Lampts, and in Winter have Stoves in their Hou&s;es, which keeps them very warm. They Drink Wine, though they are prohibited it, and ma|ny times do it over plentifully; which makes them, as other Drunkards, quarrel&s;om. They have a great many Ice-Hou&s;es curiou&s;ly Vaulted, and deep under ground to keep their Ice in, to cool their Li|quors in the hot Sea&s;ons. Many of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> take Opium, which intoxicates them in a kind of Drunkenne&s;s, and they carry it about with them, for having once habituated them&s;elves to it, they dare not leave it of, for if they do, they have mo&s;t commonly dangerous Sickne&s;&s;es, and Death is frequently the attendant.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> way of Mourning, it is expre&s;|&s;ed by a Girdle, hanging down with 2 ends before, and cro&s;&s;ing them; but on the Death of a near Re|lation, the Men rend their Caba, or Ve&s;ts, in &s;ign of Grief, and for the &s;pace of 7 Days give Alms; but the Women make doleful howlings or lament|ings for &s;ix, and &s;ometimes twelve Months, and keep them&s;elves clo&s;e, unle&s;s when they go to vi&s;it the Graves, rehear&s;ing to &s;uch as vi&s;it them, the
<PB N="97" REF="55"> Prai&s;es of the Dead, who, with their forced Lamen|tations, for it is mo&s;tly no other, di&s;turb their Neighbours re&s;t, and di&s;order them&s;elves.</P>

<P>THE King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> has an Ab&s;olute or De&s;po|tical Power over his Subjects, and anciently, the Kings were in a manner adored by their People: He meddles in matters of Religion, as well as in Se|cular Affairs, and they begin not their Fe&s;tivals till they have obtained his leave to keep them; and &s;ometimes, though the Moon has appeared, he &s;ets them back, notwith&s;tanding it is their great Fea&s;t of <HI>Ramadan.</HI> His Subjects give him great Reverence and Re&s;pect, and &s;carcely look upon him but with Trembling, paying an implicit Obedience to his Orders. If they &s;wear by his Head, the Oath is more binding to them, than when they &s;wear by the Deity; and without con&s;ulting the Law, he is the Arbitrary Judge of their Lives and Fortunes, appointing &s;uch Rewards and Puni&s;hments as he &s;hall think fit, without controul: And if the great|e&s;t Officer of the Court falls under the King's di&s;|plea&s;ure, all his Friends for&s;ake him, none daring to own him, or &s;ub&s;i&s;t him with nece&s;&s;aries, &s;o that he puts to Death whom he plea&s;es, and the neare&s;t Relations of the party are con&s;trained to &s;eem plea&s;|ed with his Inju&s;tice; nay, &s;ometimes the Sons are commanded to cut off their Fathers No&s;es, or to kill them, which order they readily obey. The&s;e Kings are &s;o jealous of being depo&s;ed, by rea&s;on of their great Tyranny, that they cau&s;e the Males of all
<PB N="98" REF="56"> their Female Kindred, to be &s;hut up in a Stone Trough, as &s;oon as Born, and there &s;tarved to Death. So &s;oon as a King comes to the Crown, he puts out the Eyes of all his Male Relations, except Sons. He &s;ometimes changes Wives with his No|bles, giving them his in&s;tead of theirs, and it is not murmured at, e&s;pecially in publick; and if he likes not his Bargain, will exchange again at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>He has a Seraglio of very beautiful Women, who are kept mighty &s;trict, for he is exceeding jealous of them, and it is Death with extream tortures, for any Man, except Eunuches, to be &s;een there; nay, they are prohibited to look on them, though they are Vailed; and when he takes any of them into the Country with him, no Men dare be in the way; and in the Town where he lodges in his Progre&s;s, all the Men are obliged to leave their Hou&s;es, till the Harum, or Lady is departed; the Eunuches to give them Notice, by crying the Courouk, and if any &s;tay after, they are &s;everely puni&s;hed: Some|times there is a Courouk for Provi&s;ion, and then none dares &s;ell any therein mentioned, but for the King's u&s;e, and this frequently la&s;ts not above a Week or two. Many times the King lays a&s;ide the &s;tifne&s;s of Maje&s;ty, and is familiar with his Subjects, and Strangers, Drinking and Eating with them in private, but it is dangerous &s;peaking ami&s;s, lea&s;t he falls into a Pa&s;&s;ion to the Party's de&s;truction, and therefore the lea&s;t &s;aid proves always the be&s;t; for many have been put to Death for their prating and advi&s;eing him, which the <HI>Franks</HI> getting Drunk will often attempt to do, when they &s;ee him &s;o familiar with them.</P>
<P>The King gives Audience to Amba&s;&s;adors, but tran&s;acts no bu&s;ine&s;s with them, for that is left to the Mini&s;ters of State, and is well plea&s;ed if they drink lu&s;tily with him, and he has a Remembrancer to tell him the next Day, all that he &s;ays or does when he is Drunk, for then, many times, he gives away Prodigally, as his Rings from his Fingers, and large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, but if he finds it an over-&s;ight, or
<PB N="99" REF="56"> too great a value for the Per&s;on, he recalls it again, and requites the Per&s;on with &s;ome little Pre&s;ent. He has an Eatmad-Doulet to tran&s;act for him, as his chief Mini&s;ter, who u&s;ually attends his Per&s;on. He has always great &s;tore of Gold in Plate, and a va&s;t Trea&s;ure in Jewels; for the Nobles pre&s;ent him in their Order, every Spring, with one rich thing or other, and he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Trea&s;ures and E&s;tates of tho&s;e he puts to Death, unle&s;s he plea&s;es to give it to their Relations; be&s;ides, the Silks are a Royal Manufactury, and he has great Incomes from them.</P>
<P>The Forces of the Kingdom con&s;i&s;ts in three Bands, or Bodies of Men, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Cor&s;chi,</HI> the <HI>Goulams,</HI> and the <HI>Teufencgi,</HI> the fir&s;t of the&s;e are de&s;cended of <HI>Turks,</HI> and Inhabit the Country, liv|ing in Tents, for the mo&s;t part, and are able to make a great Body; there are about 25000 of them con|&s;tantly in the King's Pay, having from ten to fifteen Tomans a Year; their General mu&s;t be of their Body, and is called <HI>Cor&s;chi-Ba&s;&s;a,</HI> who executes the King's Commands in putting any great Man to Death, for they will not &s;uffer the Native <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> to do it. Their chief Riches con&s;i&s;t in Cattle, which they drive from place to place, and feed in the va&s;t Plains and Mountains.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Rank of Soldiers are Slaves of ma|ny Nations, but chiefly <HI>Georgians,</HI> and about 14000 of them are in the King's Pay, and have from 5 to 8 Tomans a Year; their General is called Koul|ler Aga&s;i.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of the third Rank are &s;uch as are rai&s;ed in the Villages, mo&s;tly <HI>Armenian</HI> Renegadoes, and are about 8000, having equal Pay with the la&s;t menti|oned; the&s;e are of little regard though they March on Hor&s;eback, for in the Battle they alight and Fight on Foot; the other two Bodies Fight on Hor&s;eback, with Bows, Arrows and Harquibu&s;es.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is a new Militia of Guards that bear Muskets, but the&s;e rarely go into the Field, unle&s;s the King be there in Per&s;on. As for the Court-Officers,</P>
<PB N="100" REF="57">
<P> The <HI>Eatmad Doulet</HI> is as the Vi&s;ier <HI>Ba&s;ha</HI> in <HI>Turkey,</HI> next to him is the <HI>Sedre,</HI> who manages matters of Religion, and has divers under him; the&s;e makes all Contracts, Te&s;taments, and other publick Deeds, Judges of Divorces, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As for the <HI>Sedre,</HI> he is the High Prie&s;t of their Law; there are particularly under him a Scheick of the Law, and a Cidi, or Judge, and the&s;e are E&s;tabli&s;hed in the Principal Towns of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and are nominated by the King, and only depend upon him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pichnamaz</HI> is an Officer in every Mo&s;que, and in the King's Hou&s;hold he directs the Prayers, and makes the People &s;ay as he does, and u&s;e the &s;ame Je&s;tures, always &s;tanding before them, that they may not &s;ee him; there are as many of the&s;e in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> as there are Mo&s;ques, and they bear a con&s;i|derable Authority. The <HI>Mulas</HI> are of the &s;ame Tribe, living on the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Revenues, and their Bu&s;ine&s;s is to Teach the Sciences and Law, being properly the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Doctors, wearing relute Turbans. The <HI>Nuzar</HI> is the Wardrobe Keeper, and Ma&s;ter of the Jewels, and is a kind of a Trea|&s;urer. The <HI>Melitar</HI> is the chief Gentleman of the King's Bed-Chamber, and carrys a Pouch by his &s;ide full of Hancarchiefs, which he pre&s;ents to him as often as he requires them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Deroga</HI> is Judge of Criminal Matters, of the &s;econd degree, as Robbery, Quarels, and the like; and under him are the <HI>Aatas,</HI> or Con&s;tables: There are a great number of other Officers of le&s;&s;er Note, who&s;e Names and Offices, for Brevities &s;ake, I am con&s;trained to pa&s;s over.</P>
<P>They Hunt the Antelopes with Panthers, brought up to that purpo&s;e; this Bea&s;t creeps on its Belly till it comes near the Game, then runs with main force and leaps at it; but if the Panther mi&s;&s;es at two or three leaps, he pur&s;ues no further, but re|turns creeping back as a&s;hamed of his being Baffled. They Hawk much in this Country, and the Faul|cons brought from <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> are of great Value; they bring them up to fly at the Antelope, by feeding
<PB N="101" REF="57"> them on the No&s;e of a dead Antelope; then flying at the living ones, they fa&s;ten on his No&s;e, and pierce him with their Beaks and Tallents, flutter|ing &s;o with their Wings, that blinding his &s;ight, he &s;tops, and the Dogs coming up ea&s;ily, takes him. The King keeps for his Plea&s;ure a great many Lyons, Elephants, Leopards and Tygars.</P>
<P>To Encourage Chri&s;tians to turn <HI>Mahometans,</HI> they have a Law that gives them the E&s;tates of their Chri&s;tian Kindred when they dye, though they be in the fir&s;t Degree of Kindred, and the Decea&s;ed leaves Children; but the Judges for Money have found out a way to invade it, by cau&s;ing them to make it over to &s;ome <HI>Mahometan</HI> Friend by Te&s;ta|ment, who po&s;&s;e&s;s it in tru&s;t for the Widow and Children.</P>
<P>They have an odd way to make Women confe&s;s their Crimes, <HI>viz.</HI> they tye their hands behind them, and then put large live Rats into their Drawers next their Fle&s;h, which runing up and down, and pinch|ing them, extort Confe&s;&s;ions from them; for of all Creatures in the World, the Rat is mo&s;t terrible and frightful to them. As for the Men to bring them to a Confe&s;&s;ion of their Guilt, their fle&s;h is pulled off with Pinchers from their Legs, Arms and Thighs.</P>
<P>When the Sun is Eclip&s;ed, they run to their Mo&s;ques, and &s;ay a Prayer made for that purpo&s;e, imploring God to avert heavy Judgments from them, and not to leave them in Darkne&s;s; at the Eclips of the Moon, they beat their Kettle and Bra&s;s Pans, making a Hedious din, per&s;wading them&s;elves they help her &s;o in her Labour to expell the Darkne&s;s, which upon the going off of the Eclip&s;e, her mo|tion makes her &s;eem to &s;trugle with.</P>
<P>When a Hou&s;e is on Fire, they let it burn out, &s;a|ving however what Goods they can, &s;aying, <HI>Provi|dence will &s;top it of it &s;elf when it &s;ees &s;it;</HI> yet they freely permit others, who are not of their Religion, to endeavour the Extinction of the Flames.</P>
<PB N="102" REF="58">
<P> They hold Chri&s;tians &s;o impure, that if they have touched any Food in the Market, and they know it, they will not buy it; and if one comes in|to a Bagnio, the Ma&s;ter of it is obliged to wa&s;h it a|gain before the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> will enter; yet they own Chri&s;t &s;hall come at the la&s;t Day, and be <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Lieutenant, and then all &s;hall embrace the <HI>Mahome|tan</HI> Profe&s;&s;ion, for then <HI>Mahomet</HI> will take a Wife, and have a numerous I&s;&s;ue. They hold Marriage in &s;o great Veneration, that they blame him becau&s;e he never was Married. They keep their Fea&s;ts a Day before the <HI>Turks,</HI> for the <HI>Turks</HI> begin not their <HI>Bairam,</HI> or <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> till they &s;ee the Moon, and the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> do it according to the Moon's cour&s;e, being more knowing in the Cele&s;tial Sciences. The <HI>Per|&s;ian</HI> Kings are the more Reverenc'd, becau&s;e they are held to be of the Race of <HI>Aly, Mahomet</HI>'s Succe&s;&s;or. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are divided into two Sects, one called <HI>Schiai,</HI> the other <HI>Sunni;</HI> the fir&s;t think it enough to follow the Commands of the Law; but the other do that, and likewi&s;e ob&s;erve Councils.</P>
<P>At their <HI>Little Bairam</HI> they Sacrifice a Camel in <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> the King fir&s;t &s;trikes it with a Javellin, and then the People from the four Quarters of the City A&s;&s;emble in a tumultuous manner, and hew the poor Bea&s;t to pieces, with Swords, Axes, Glaves, and the like, every one &s;triving to get a part of him, &s;o that it often comes to a quarrel, and many are killed; the pieces they get they broil and Eat, ac|counting it Sacred Meat. In other Cities they kill an Ox in like manner, and in their Hou&s;es many Sheep, which they di&s;tribute to the Poor.</P>
<P>In their Creed they have an odd imagination con|cerning Man's dying: They hold that every one mu&s;t come and die in the place where the Angel took the Earth on which he has been formed, ima|gining that one of the Cele&s;tial Spirits has the care committed to him, of forming the Human Creature, by mingling a little Du&s;t with the Seed of the Pa|rents.</P>
<PB N="103" REF="58">
<P> They allow liberty of Con&s;cience to all Stran|gers, and there are at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> a great many <HI>Jews, Banians, Guebres,</HI> and <HI>Armenians,</HI> who pur&s;ue their &s;everal Tenents. They have a great many Hor&s;es, Mules, and Camels, at all Sea&s;ons, and though the&s;e things are here &s;et down, many of the Parti|culars may &s;erve in General for all <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and there|fore, having been detained in this City too long, I fear, from the intended Travels, I now take my leave of it, to proceed on my Journey.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XV. <HI>Travels from</HI> I&s;pahan <HI>to</HI> Ormus <HI>and</HI> Ba&s;&s;aru, <HI>in the</HI> Per&s;ian <HI>Gulf; with an Ob&s;ervation of many Places and Things by the way, of</HI> Per&s;ia <HI>in General,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HAving &s;tayed about 4 Months at <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> I re&s;ol|ved to vi&s;it <HI>Schiras,</HI> and took the opportunity of a Caravan then &s;etting out; we parted early in the Morning and journied South-ea&s;t, meeting in our way with large Plains very barren; &s;ome of the&s;e produced pieces of Salt Earth, made by the Salive part of the Ground, and the working of the Rain on it, and this being refined makes good Salt; leav|ing the&s;e Plains, we encountered with Hills, very difficult to pa&s;s, becau&s;e, though not high, they were Rockey, and very Slippery, &s;o that many of the Mules ca&s;t their Burthens, which proved very trouble&s;ome to us, and took up much time to reload them; but having pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e Hills, we came to <HI>Mayar,</HI> a ruined Village, which is the beginning, or entrance into the Country of <HI>Fars,</HI> the real Ancient <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and there we lodged in a Kervan&s;erai, and
<PB N="104" REF="59"> going from thence, had, for a good way, a plea&s;ant Country on either &s;ide of us, fruitful in Trees and Corn Ground; but meeting with a Chan, and his Harams, or Women, we were forced to fetch a com|pa&s;s to give free Pa&s;&s;age, for the&s;e great Governors in their Provinces, are as Ab&s;olute as a King, and will have their Commands as &s;trictly obeyed.</P>
<P>It will be in a manner endle&s;s, to tell you all the Villages, Hills, Plains, Valleys, and Rivers by their Names, that we pa&s;&s;ed in this long and tedious Journey, therefore, for brevity &s;ake, in a tired con|dition, I ha&s;ten as fa&s;t as I can to <HI>Schirars.</HI></P>
<P>This City is the Metropolis of the Ancient <HI>Per|&s;ia;</HI> &s;ome will have it to be the Ancient <HI>Cyropolis;</HI> the Gates we enter'd at were very Fair and Stately, leading to a broad Street, bordered with Gardens, and at the end of it is a large Stone Ba&s;on full of Water to refre&s;h Travellers; further there is a Bridge with 5 Arches, under which runs a &s;mall River, and a little beyond a covered Bazar; and though this Street is very fair and long, it is accounted only the Suburb to the City. It lies in a plea&s;ant fertile Plain at the Ea&s;t of it, where is a little Hill covered with Orange and Lemon Trees, intermixed with Cypre&s;|&s;es: It lies from North to South, and is about two Hours walk in Circumference. It has many fair Mo&s;ques, and a Colledge in it: There are Sallaries allowed to divers Learned Men in the latter, to teach Theology, Philo&s;ophy, and Phy&s;ick, and &s;ometimes there are 4 or 500 Students in the it: The Gates are laid over with blue Earth varni&s;hed, &s;hin|ing like Saphires.</P>
<P>The Gardens are exceeding plea&s;ant, adorned with Fruits, Flowers, Canals, Fountains, and Sum|mer-Hou&s;es, on little rai&s;ed Mounts, but many of the Hou&s;es are ruinous, for the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are very Su|pine in repairing decayed Fabricks.</P>
<P>This is a City of great Trade, in compari&s;on of many others, by rea&s;on the <HI>Indian</HI> Merchants bring the rich Commodities of that Country hither. There is a Well of a va&s;t depth and circumference, into
<PB N="105" REF="59"> which they throw Women convicted of Adultery, and there &s;uffer them mi&s;erably to Peri&s;h; it is cut all out of a hard Rock. A little di&s;tant there is a &s;tately Mo&s;que, and in it the Tomb of <HI>Scheik Sadi,</HI> an excellent <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Poet, whom they Honour as a Saint: There is a Well not far from this, and a Stream running under it, full of Fi&s;h, which none may take on pain of Death, unle&s;s the Dervi&s;h who looks after it, connive at them, which he will do for a little pre&s;ent, and keep off all Spies, by pretending there are Women in the Wells, and then the Men run away as from &s;ome fearful Mon&s;ter. One goes down to it by a pair of Stairs.</P>
<P>There is much Gla&s;s made in this City; they make a Gla&s;s Bottle, called a <HI>Caraba,</HI> that will hold near 30 Quarts, covering them with Cane, or Straw; and here is to be found the be&s;t Wine in the King|dom; they have abundance of Capers, plenty of Ro&s;e-Water, and pre&s;erve Grapes for the whole Year. A Vizar Governs here as the King's Farmer, and pays yearly 1000 Tomans, amounting to 15000 Crowns.</P>
<P>We &s;tayed here but 2 Days, and then &s;et out for <HI>Lar,</HI> in our way to <HI>Bender,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing over Plains, Hills, and Rivers, meeting by the way whole Fami|lies of <HI>Arabs</HI> driving their Cattle, we arrived there. This Town is &s;mall, and &s;eated on a Rock; it is Commanded by a Chan, who has a &s;tately Hou&s;e, with a Divan; it has a fine Market-place, a Bazars, and a Ca&s;tle; the la&s;t is very &s;trong, and built all of Stone. There are a great many <HI>Jews</HI> inhabit, and drive a con&s;iderable Trade here; all the Country a|bout <HI>Lar</HI> is full of Tamarisks that are very large here, and in mo&s;t parts of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> the Sparrows be|ing in great numbers, de&s;troy and wa&s;t the Fruits of the Earth exceedingly.</P>
<P>Taking a good refre&s;hment in this Town, we took our way through a Country much like the for|mer we had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince our leaving <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and by tire&s;ome Journeys came to <HI>Bender-Aba&s;&s;i,</HI> where we no &s;ooner entred but were carried to the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e
<PB N="106" REF="60"> and had our Goods &s;earched; in our way I &s;hould have told you, grew poy&s;onous Plants, of which a &s;trange &s;tory goes, <HI>viz.</HI> That if any Man comes near them in <HI>June</HI> ot <HI>July,</HI> when South Winds from the Sea blows upon them, they &s;end forth &s;uch a poy&s;onous Vapour, which drawn in with the breath, cau&s;es the Body all over, to be in a burning heat, and immediately the Party dies, &s;o that in tho&s;e Months the way is little frequented. The <HI>Per|&s;ians</HI> affirm this for Truth, and call the plants <HI>Kher|zehreb;</HI> but this infection is rather concluded by the Judicious to be in that Wind they call the Burying-Wind.</P>
<P>This Town is very little, govern'd by a Chan, and is of a prodigious Traffick, as being commodi|ou&s;ly Scituated for Trade; the <HI>Schah Bender</HI> is the chief Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officer, part of which Cu&s;toms belong by right to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> by a Contract, when they a&s;&s;i&s;ted the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> King in taking <HI>Ormus,</HI> but they have been much defrauded, and reap lit|lit benefit. It has only one publick Gate, a Bazar, and a Fort to the Sea-&s;ide, which is a &s;quare Plat|form of about 4 Fathom each Face, and 2 in heighth, there not being above 5 or 6 Port-holes for great Guns; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> have their Hou&s;es by the Sea-&s;ide, and the proper Flags of the Nations fixed on Poles on the Tarra&s;&s;es, to direct Ships thi|ther.</P>
<P>About 2 Leagues from the main Land is the <HI>Glory of I&s;lands,</HI> &s;o termed, <HI>viz.</HI> the famed <HI>Ormus,</HI> at the Mouth of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulf; it is Southward from the main Land, the Gulf reaching from thence to <HI>Ba&s;&s;era,</HI> which is in the bottom of it. <HI>Ormus</HI> lies in 27 degrees North Latitude, 180 Leagues from <HI>Ba&s;|&s;ora;</HI> it has a Fort that was built by the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> but taken from them by the great <HI>Schah Abbas,</HI> King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> The I&s;land is no more than 3 Leagues in circumference, and mo&s;tly Rockey, but it has gotten its Fame from the Riches that flowed thither, from <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> as being a con&s;iderable Mart, e&s;pecially when the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI>
<PB N="107" REF="60"> held it. As for the Water and Provi&s;ions, they are mo&s;tly brought from the main Land, and becau&s;e there is a deficiency of Springs, they keep rain Wa|ter in Ci&s;terns, and little more now is Inhabited be|&s;ide the Fort, round which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have cut a Trench, and let the Sea into it by a Canal, for it &s;tands on the point of the I&s;land, and is the la&s;t Pro|vince of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> this way. There are great &s;tore of Oy&s;ters about it, about the bigne&s;s of ours, but much harder to open. A League to the South-we&s;t is the I&s;land of <HI>Lareca,</HI> it is bigger then <HI>Ormus,</HI> but very Barren, the Ground con&s;i&s;ting of a burning Sand; it reaches in length from North-we&s;t to South-ea&s;t: There is little in it except a Fort, which was be|gun by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> but the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> fearing they would prove ill Neighbours if they fortified it, took it out of their Hands, and fini&s;hed it.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> in General, it is environed with Mountains and Barren De&s;arts, which are main Bulworks again&s;t the attempts of powerful Ene|mies. Their is a &s;carcity of Money, which is one main rea&s;on they cannot &s;et a great Army on Foot in &s;o va&s;t a Country: and this, I think, proceeds from the &s;mallne&s;s of Trade, for the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are not very indu&s;trious, all of them &s;tanding much on points of Honour. There are few or no Fruit-Trees to be found but in Gardens; and in mo&s;t places the Water is bad, and Wood exceeding &s;carce in almo&s;t all the Provinces. Their chief Manufacture is Silk, and &s;ome Stuffs. There is abundance of Liquorice growing almo&s;t every where, but little of it &s;et. The Country abounds in Brooks, which render the ways very bad to Travel in Winter, and &s;ome Ri|vers, mo&s;t of which are in <HI>Mazandara,</HI> who&s;e chief is <HI>E&s;chref,</HI> and mo&s;t of the&s;e Rivers fall into the <HI>Ca&s;|pian</HI> Sea.</P>
<P>Here is the greate&s;t &s;tore of Wood in the whole Country of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> but there are a va&s;t number of Serpents and Scorpions, who dying in multitudes, during the hot Sea&s;on, corrupt and infect the Air, rendering it unwhole&s;ome; &s;o that in fine, <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is
<PB N="108" REF="61"> &s;aid to be a large Kervan&s;erai, that &s;erves for a Pa&s;|&s;age for the Money and Goods that go out of <HI>A&s;ia, Turkey,</HI> and <HI>Europe</HI> to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and to the Stuffs and Spices returning, of which they have a &s;mall Profit.</P>

<P>BEING now at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> preparing for a Voy|age to the <HI>Indies,</HI> it will not be ami&s;s to enter|tain you with a brief Relation of <HI>Aethiopia,</HI> or the Country of <HI>Aby&s;&s;ins,</HI> which I had of a <HI>French</HI> Gentle|man I found here, who had Travelled in that va&s;t Country, and lived &s;ome time in the Court; and this I the rather &s;et down, becau&s;e I know not whether I &s;hall ever Travel into that famed Country, yet I &s;hall be as Brief as may be.</P>
<P>He told me it was bounded on the Ea&s;t by the <HI>Red</HI> Sea, and <HI>Zanguebar,</HI> on the South by <HI>Avou&s;a, Zi|ela, Narca, &amp;c.</HI> on the We&s;t with <HI>Nubia,</HI> and the Country of <HI>Negros;</HI> on the North with part of <HI>Nu|bia,</HI> and <HI>Bugia,</HI> and is about 7 Months Travel in Circuit. The King has four Kings Tributary to him, <HI>viz.</HI> The King of <HI>Senner,</HI> who pays him Tri|bute in Hor&s;es, and lives in an exce&s;&s;ive hot Coun|try; the King of <HI>Naria,</HI> who pays him Tribute in du&s;t Gold; the Kings of <HI>Bugia,</HI> and <HI>Dangala,</HI> who
<PB N="109" REF="61"> &s;ends their Tribute in Stuffs and Slaves. In this Country are Mines, out of which Gold is gotten, and &s;ent to the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Saffala</HI> and <HI>Guinea,</HI> and the&s;e Mines are &s;hallower than in other Countries. They have likewi&s;e a great deal of Civet, which is &s;crap|ed from the Te&s;tacles, or rather from an opening &s;lit between or near the Cods of a Civet Cat; this Bea&s;t is almo&s;t as big as a midling Grey-hound, with a &s;harp No&s;e and Head like a Fox; they have Feet, Tail, and Whiskers like a Cat.</P>
<P>When the People of the Country fall out, they go before their Scheiks, who do the good Office to make them Friends again. They anoint their Heads with a &s;trong Oyl, extracted from the Root of an Herb, to keep them from &s;warming with Lice, which they are very &s;ubject to. The Provinces of <HI>Aethio|pia</HI> are, <HI>Gouyan</HI> (where the King has a Viceroy) <HI>Beg|handir, Amara, Dambia,</HI> all very Mountainous; <HI>Da|moud, Tygre,</HI> and <HI>Barnegas;</HI> al&s;o other Provinces de|pending on it, Governed by Princes who are his Va&s;&s;als. The Air is in &s;ome places temperate, but in <HI>Senner</HI> very hot. In this Kingdom are 24 Tam|bours, or Viceroys. The Capital City is <HI>Gonthar</HI> in the Province of <HI>Dambia.</HI> The King has 100 Wives, and yet &s;o little Jealous, contrary to the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> that he keeps no Eunuchs to look after them, it being counted a Sin in that Coun|try to geld a Man; He is of ea&s;ie acce&s;s, &s;o that the poore&s;t have freedom to make their complaints to him, or &s;peak to him what they are minded: He keeps the numerous Children he has by his ma|ny Wives, on a Mountain, called <HI>Ouohhni,</HI> 2 days journy from <HI>Gonthar.</HI> On the top of the Mountain there is a plea&s;ant Cave, where they keep them a Nights, and in the Day time when they are big e|nough, their Guardians let them play about the Mountains. When the King dies, they chu&s;e one of the wittie&s;t and likelie&s;t of them, and Crown him, not regarding Birth-right; then are the Bro|thers removed a di&s;tant place to be kept Pri&s;oners, and his Children as he gets them, &s;ent to the fore|mentioned Mountain.</P>
<PB N="110" REF="62">
<P> The Burying-place of the Kings is called <HI>Aye&s;us,</HI> and is a Grot cut out &s;quare in a Rock, there the A|ged are laid on one &s;ide, and the Younger on the other &s;ide: and near it &s;tood a very pretty Church built by the Je&s;uits, but they diving into Politicks, and State Matters, gave &s;uch &s;u&s;pition to the King, that they intended to undermine his Throne, as made him bani&s;h them, and demoli&s;h their Church and Hou&s;es, puting &s;ome to Death that lingred behind, as al&s;o divers Capuchins, &s;etting a bag of du&s;t-Gold on their Heads, which made the <HI>Aby&s;&s;ins</HI> hunt out, and cut off divers of them, which they &s;ent to the King, and received their promi&s;ed Reward; &s;o that the poor Fathers were forced to pack up and be gone; however, in the place where the Church &s;tood, there is a place erected which contains a curious Library, &s;tored with Books of di|vers kinds of Learning, in various Languages. This Country produces very good Wheat and Barley, and is pretty Fruitful in mo&s;t places where the De&s;arts are not, for there are very great ones in it, of 3 or 4 Days Journey, which are Wavey, like the Sea, when the Wind blows &s;trong from the South, or South-we&s;t, in&s;omuch, that Men and Cattle are buried under Mountains of loo&s;e Sand, if they be in the way, where the De&s;arts lie mo&s;t expo&s;ed to tho&s;e Hurricanes.</P>
<P>The King in his Progre&s;s, always lodges in Tents, the Hou&s;es of their chief Nobles being very mean, in re&s;pect of tho&s;e in <HI>Europe;</HI> and the Walls of tho&s;e of the meaner &s;ort are of Mud and Slime. There are almo&s;t Men of all Trades in this Country; they have no Camels here, but &s;tore of Mules, Hor&s;es, A&s;&s;es, and Oxen. The People have an ill cu&s;tom in eating raw Fle&s;h, except the King, who has it dre&s;&s;ed, and drinks Wine of the Grape; the re&s;t drink a Liquor made of Millet, or Sara&s;in-Wheat, and they have a Spirit made of it as &s;trong as Bran|dy. They have Cloths, Stuffs, and Velvets, Im|ported by the way of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and are Habited like the <HI>Franks</HI> or <HI>Europeans.</HI></P>
<PB N="111" REF="62">
<P> The King has a Guard of Harquibu&s;iers. As for their Money, it is pieces of Cloth cut out, going by weight, and little pieces of Salt they cut out on the &s;ide of the <HI>Red Sea.</HI> The places where they make it is called <HI>Arho.</HI> There is among&s;t them the Na|tion of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> who have no Fire-Arms, but u&s;e in War Sphears and Targets, and often make War with the <HI>Aethiopians;</HI> their Riches con&s;i&s;ting in Cat|tle, and as this Gentleman informed me, there are a great number of different Languages &s;poken in this Country; and di&s;cour&s;ing him about the River <HI>Nile,</HI> which has its ri&s;e there, he told me, he had &s;een the &s;ource of it, and that the Spring ri&s;es in, and i&s;&s;ues out of a Well in a large Plain, &s;hadowed with many Trees, and that well or Spring is called <HI>O|vembromma.</HI></P>
<P>It ri&s;es in the Province, or Little Country of <HI>Ago,</HI> and is a very plea&s;ant Water there; from the Spring it runs Northward, through a long tract of Land, and having pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal Cataracts, or falls, which are very high places, with a terrible roaring, it pa&s;&s;es on &s;moothly till it enters <HI>Aegypt,</HI> and is, as I have el&s;ewhere &s;aid, the main &s;upport of that Coun|try, for &s;hould the <HI>Aethiopian</HI> King turn the Current, <HI>Aegypt</HI> would be little better than a De&s;art, which the Grand Signior, as many have gue&s;&s;ed, fearing, is the cau&s;e he mole&s;ts not the <HI>Aethiopians</HI> with War; and the rea&s;on of its over-flowing in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> may be &s;up|po&s;ed to proceed from the great Rains that fall in <HI>Aethiopia</HI> about that time; for when it is Summer in one place, it is Winter in another. There are but a Mountains any thing near the Spring of <HI>Nile,</HI> and tho&s;e are called the <HI>Jews</HI> Mountains, becau&s;e they once inhabited them, but growing powerful, were driven out for fear they &s;hould Rebel, and com|pelled to live in the Plains. The&s;e Mountains are exceeding high, for in that hot Country they have always Snow on their Tops or Spires.</P>
<P>There is a Generation of <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> among the <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> for anciently the Moori&s;h King of <HI>Zeila</HI> forcing a King of <HI>Aethiopia</HI> to fly into the Moun|tains,
<PB N="112" REF="63"> he implored aid of the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> to re&s;tore him to his Throne, who, with their Fire-Arms &s;lew the Moori&s;h King, and &s;o terrified his Army, that they left the Country; and for this, their Tra|ders on the Coa&s;t, were put into Offices, and had rich Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions be&s;towed on them, when &s;etling and Marrying with the Native Women, their progeny encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The King, and all his People, are a kind of Chri|&s;tians of the Cophli&s;h Religion, and believe but one Nature in <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> at the end of 8 Days they Circumci&s;e their Males, and Bapti&s;e them 14 Days after, their Patriarch depends on him of <HI>Alex|andria.</HI> They &s;ay Ma&s;s as the <HI>Cophites</HI> do, but their Books are in their own Language. When their Patriarch dies, they &s;end to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and that Patriarch &s;ends them a fit Per&s;on.</P>

<P>STaying at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora</HI> for a fair Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Ea&s;t-India,</HI> in a little time it happen'd, as I could wi&s;h; I found an <HI>Armenian</HI> Ship there of 28 Guns, and mo&s;t of the Mariners were <HI>Banians</HI> of <HI>India,</HI> the re&s;t <HI>Ar|menians,</HI> except the Ma&s;ter and two more, who were <HI>European</HI> Chri&s;tians; the Ma&s;ter an <HI>Itallian,</HI> and the two Mariners <HI>Greeks:</HI> This Ship was <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> built, and very &s;tench, but how it came into their Hands
<PB N="113" REF="63"> they declined to tell me, though I afterward under|&s;tood, they had bought it for 16000 Roupies when it was in a bad condition, and repairing it they put up <HI>Armenian</HI> Colours, and had 3 Pa&s;sports to indem|fie them from the <HI>Europeans</HI> that have Factories in <HI>India.</HI> Our Cargo con&s;i&s;ted of &s;uch things as could not be vended at <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> as Indico, Cloth, Dates, Che&s;ts of Gla&s;s, Venetian Looking-Gla&s;&s;es, and a good quantity of Money to buy <HI>Indian</HI> Commodi|ties. I hired a Cabin, and laid in Provi&s;ion and Water, fearing in &s;o hot a Voyage, the latter might grow &s;carce; and it was not without precaution, for &s;o it happened. Setting Sail, and getting clear of the I&s;lands, we &s;teered South-we&s;t, and had Water, at 5, and 8 Fathom, 2 Men being continually heaving the Lead, lea&s;t we &s;hould fall on Shallows, or Rocks that are under Water near the Shoar.</P>
<P>It will be endle&s;s to tell you the often &s;hifting of the Wind, the Calms we had, and the Tackings we made; therefore, let me &s;ay with &s;ome difficul|ty we got to the I&s;land of <HI>Carek,</HI> the fir&s;t place the Ship de&s;igned to Traffick at. This I&s;land reaches in length, from South-ea&s;t to North-we&s;t, is very narrow about 3 or 4 leagues in circumference, and 50 Leagues from <HI>Bo&s;&s;ara;</HI> it is partly Hills, and partly Plains, yielding Grapes, Barley, Wheat, Dates, and good &s;tore of fre&s;h Water, which is a precious commodity in tho&s;e Countries: There are Wells dug on the top of Rocks 10 or 12 Fathom deep, and have Steps to go down, and from the bottom of the&s;e Wells the Water pa&s;&s;es, and runs under ground into the Plains. Near to the Wells there is a neat Mo&s;que on the Hill, and on the I&s;land is 150 indifferent Hou&s;es, and near it a Pearl Fi&s;h|ery. The King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is Lord of it, and great numbers of Boats come to Fi&s;h for them in <HI>May, June, July,</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> Here we unladed part of our Goods, but &s;old little, by rea&s;on a Dutchman had been there before and fore&s;talled us, giving out this Ship would not touch there, by which means over and above, he took in a great many Pa&s;&s;engers, and Lading for <HI>India.</HI></P>
<PB N="114" REF="64">
<P> Being thus di&s;appointed, we &s;oon weighed An|chor, and &s;teered away South South ea&s;t with a ve|ry gentle Wind, but were &s;oon becalmed for many Hours; then &s;prung up an Ea&s;terly Wind, and we &s;tood away to the South, and &s;oon had the I&s;le of <HI>Ri&s;cher</HI> on our Larboard, which is very near the main Land, and makes a little Port, called <HI>Bender-Ri&s;cher,</HI> which is guarded by a Fort, and &s;tanding away, we came up with the I&s;land of <HI>Coucher,</HI> and left it on our Larboard; this I&s;land is large, and indifferent Fruitful; and &s;o Sailing on, pa&s;&s;ed Cape <HI>Verde&s;tan</HI> at 3 or 4 Leagues di&s;tance; and as we Sailed, we had often a faint view of the main Land of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> e&s;pecially where it lay high and Moun|tainous; but before we came to the I&s;land of <HI>Lar</HI> we lo&s;t our Long-Boat, which was a great di&s;ap|pointment to us.</P>
<P><HI>Lar</HI> is a little De&s;art I&s;land, bearing nothing but a few Trees at the We&s;t North-we&s;t end of it; we pa&s;&s;ed by this, and the next that pre&s;ented was <HI>An|dravia,</HI> a little low I&s;land near the main Land; and pa&s;&s;ing by we had <HI>Kies,</HI> another I&s;land to the South-We&s;t; it is indifferently Inhabited, the Hou&s;es ly|ing up and down in it, but Coa&s;ting <HI>Paloro,</HI> and leaving Mount <HI>Sennas</HI> on the Main Land to the Larboard, we made <HI>Congo,</HI> a little Town in the Kingdom of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> 27 Degrees, 15 Minutes North Latitude; it &s;tands on the Sea-&s;ide, near the Foot of a black Rock that &s;helter the Town from the North Winds, and behind there is a white Rock, or Hill, and many &s;uch along the Coa&s;t. The Town lies from We&s;t North-we&s;t, to Ea&s;t South-ea&s;t, and is defended by a little Ca&s;tle, where 3 pieces of Cannon are mounted, and has a &s;afe Road for Shipping to Ride in, though they are very much to&s;&s;ed in high Winds, about it are 5 Gardens reple|ni&s;hed with Fruit-Trees, as Figs, Lemons, Quinces, Oranges, Pears, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Large Pomgranates, Mel|lons, and Palm-Trees; there are al&s;o the <HI>Indian</HI> Mangoes; they have <HI>Schiras-Wine,</HI> and Brandy, made of Dates; there are near it Hills, producing
<PB N="115" REF="64"> Sulphur, which is dug and tran&s;ported to the <HI>Indies.</HI> The Cu&s;tom is ea&s;ie, half of it belonging to the King af <HI>Portugal</HI> by Agreement, be&s;ide five Hor&s;es the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> pre&s;ents him every Year; and to this end there is a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Agent re&s;iding in the Town, who has the Colours of that Nation on the Tarras of his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Leaving this place after the &s;ale of &s;ome Goods, and taking in others, we &s;et Sail for <HI>Sindy,</HI> being the fir&s;t Town of <HI>India,</HI> where the River <HI>Indus</HI> di&s;|charges it &s;elf into the Sea; but here we narrowly e&s;caped falling into the hands of the <HI>Zinganes,</HI> a &s;ort of <HI>Indian</HI> Pirates, who lie with their Boats be|hind the Rocks, to &s;urprize Ve&s;&s;els as they come near them, and if they board a Ship, in the fir&s;t fury, till they have ma&s;tered and &s;ecured the Prize, they put all to the Sword, and the re&s;t they Lame, by cutting the Sinew above the Heel, and make them Slaves to keep their Cattle; they &s;o u&s;e them to prevent their running away: Their Arms are only Swords, and Arrows, therefore our watchful|ne&s;s, and the fire of our great Guns made them re|tire again among the Rocks, &s;o &s;oon as they prepa|red to attack us. But having little to do here, we &s;et Sail for <HI>Surat,</HI> having now on Board us, by ta|king in many Pa&s;&s;engers 116 Souls, and pa&s;&s;ing many &s;mall I&s;lands, and &s;ome Promontories came to <HI>Que&s;chimo,</HI> a large low I&s;land, &s;o that Sailing by it, one may &s;ee the Mountains of the main Land over it; it lies from Ea&s;t to We&s;t 20 Leagues in length, but indifferent in breadth. There is a Fort where Ships Anchor at 6 Fathom Water, and this formerly belonged to the <HI>Portugue&s;e.</HI> On the South Ea&s;t of it lies <HI>Nabdgion,</HI> or <HI>Pilombo,</HI> a little low De|&s;art I&s;land; and Ea&s;t of it <HI>Tonbo,</HI> affording little be|&s;ide Antelopes and Coneys; but Ships have here the Advantage of many Wells to Water at, yet the entrance is dangerous, becau&s;e of the Banks that lie under Water about it; the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> were once Ma&s;ters of mo&s;t of the&s;e I&s;lands, and exacted Tri|bute from Ships that Traded there, but their
<PB N="116" REF="65"> Strength and Riches decaying at Home, weakned it abroad, &s;o that now they have lo&s;t mo&s;t of their footing on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>Sailing from hence, in a little time, we had the I&s;le of <HI>Angom</HI> to the North ea&s;t, and on the South-ea&s;t a Port of <HI>Arabia Foelix,</HI> called <HI>Julfer,</HI> to which many <HI>Indian</HI> Barks come to buy Dates and Pearl, the latter being fi&s;hed all along the Coa&s;t from <HI>Ma&s;|cat</HI> to <HI>Babrem,</HI> and bring <HI>European</HI> Money to pur|cha&s;e them. The next that &s;tood with us were the I&s;les of <HI>Salame;</HI> the&s;e are four Rocks over-again&s;t Cape <HI>Mo&s;andon,</HI> one of them bigger than the re&s;t ri&s;ing a little into a point, there is a dangerous Cha|nel pa&s;&s;ing between them, all Rock at the bottom, &s;o that many adventuring to pa&s;s it have been ca&s;t a|way.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e, we met with great &s;torms of Hail, accompanied with prodigious Thunders and Lightning, in&s;omuch, that the Sea &s;eemed to be all on Fire. This made us furl our Sails, and though the Air on Head of us was as dark as Night, there appeared a Rainbow on our Starboard.</P>
<P>Upon the breaking of this Storm prodigious Spouts began to ri&s;e out of the Sea to our Lar|board, and at length, encrea&s;ed almo&s;t on all &s;ides of us, &s;ome being very near, which put us into a con&s;iderable fright, lea&s;t falling on our Ship they &s;hould &s;ink it, they being extraordinary large, in&s;o|much, that all affirmed they had not &s;een the like in their Lives, &s;o that all Hands were employed to &s;ecure the Ship as well as might be, from the threat|ning danger; for we as good as gave our &s;elves to be lo&s;t; however, tru&s;ting in the Creator of all things, and taking to my &s;elf more Courage than ordinary, I took a view of the&s;e watery Prodigies: The fir&s;t that appeared was about a Musket-&s;hot from us, as we were &s;teering North-ea&s;t, and before it ro&s;e, the Water in that place boiled up prodigiou&s;ly, more than a Foot above the &s;urface of the Sea, foaming and looking whiti&s;h, and over it &s;omething repre|&s;enting a black Smoak (which the <HI>Banians</HI> fooli&s;hly
<PB N="117" REF="65"> &s;aid was the Devil &s;ucking up Water to drown them.) This made a hurrying noi&s;e like a Torrent running in a Valley, mixed with a hi&s;&s;ing like that of Ser|pents, or Gees. A little after appeared a dark puff of &s;teem, this &s;eemed to be a Pipe as big as ones Finger, the noi&s;e continuing, this tapered as it were up to the Clouds, and the light put it out of our &s;ight, &s;o that we knew that Spout was &s;pent; but then there was another to the Southward of us, which began in the &s;ame manner as the former, &s;oon after another to the We&s;tward, and another to the &s;ide of the &s;econd, the mo&s;t remote of the three; and all the&s;e appeared like &s;o many bundles of Straw, a Foot and an half, or two Foot above the &s;urface of the Water, &s;moaking to appearance exceedingly, making the &s;ame noi&s;e as the fir&s;t. A little while after I perceived &s;o many Pipes reaching down from the Clouds upon the&s;e Ri&s;ings, and every one of them had a large end joyning to the Cloud, wide|ning like the end of a Trumpet, and the lower end re&s;embled the Teat, or Dug of a Bea&s;t, &s;tretched perpendicularly down by the force of &s;ome weight. The&s;e Pipes appeared to be of a palei&s;h White, which I conjecture was the Water in them, for no doubt they were formed before they drew it up, and being emptied di&s;appeared; for though the Pipes de&s;cended &s;mall, &s;welled with the Water they grew larger, to the thickne&s;s of a Man's Arm, or more.</P>
<P>The&s;e Spouts are dangerous things, for falling on a Ship they entangle the Sails, and lift her up, then leting her fall again &s;ink her if &s;he be &s;mall, but if the Ship be too heavy to be lifted, they &s;plit the Sails, and emptying a va&s;t quantity of Water into her with a violent force, &s;ink her, and thus I be|lieve Ships have been lo&s;t, Sailing in tho&s;e, and o|ther Seas where Spouts are, and &s;o going down in a Minute or two, have never been heard of. Some that were on Board brought a large black handled Knife, to cut the Spouts at a di&s;tance, which Su|per&s;titious Fancy is thus put in practice: One of the Ships company kneels down by the Main-Ma&s;t,
<PB N="118" REF="66"> and holding in one Hand a Knife with a black han|dle, he Reads the Go&s;pel of St. <HI>John,</HI> and when he comes to the&s;e Words, <HI>viz. The Word was made Fle&s;h, and dwells in us,</HI> he turns to the Spout and cuts the Air a thwart, and then they hold the Spout, though at a great di&s;tance, is cut, and lets down all its Water with a great noi&s;e. But the Ma&s;ter looking on this &s;illy fruitle&s;s Fancy as a piece of Conjurati|on, would not let it be put in practice. In the <HI>Me|diterranean</HI> they &s;hoot Cro&s;s bar &s;hot at them, which hitting is more probable of the two to cut; how|ever, the&s;e &s;pent them&s;elves without doing us any harm; and at length, through infinite Mercy, we weathered the Storm which raged furiou&s;ly all the time, and kept on our Cour&s;e having the main Land of <HI>Arabia</HI> on our Starboard, and on our Lar|board that part of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> called <HI>Mar&s;an,</HI> which bore South-ea&s;t of us, and we made particularly one Hill of Land &s;haped like a Sugar Loaf; and here, in <HI>November, December,</HI> and <HI>January,</HI> the Ea&s;t Winds commonly Reign, and therefore to go from <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to <HI>India</HI> in a &s;hort time, the be&s;t Sea&s;on is <HI>March, April,</HI> and the beginning of <HI>May,</HI> for then the <HI>Mou|&s;on,</HI> or Trading Wind blows. However, we held on with the help of the Current, which from the end of <HI>July</HI> to <HI>January</HI> &s;ets towards <HI>Ormus</HI> from <HI>In|dia,</HI> and from <HI>January</HI> till <HI>July</HI> from <HI>Ormus</HI> towards <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>In our Pa&s;&s;age another Storm ari&s;ing, we &s;aw 3 new Spouts, but they were at too great a di&s;tance from us to apprehend much dangar. In our way, off <HI>Bembaceca,</HI> we overtook 3 Ships bound to <HI>Surat,</HI> as we were, but proving &s;low Sailers, the Ma&s;ter would not &s;tay for them, but re&s;olved to make the be&s;t of his way, &s;o contrary to the mind of the Mate, we left them to Sail at their lei&s;ure.</P>

<P>AFter many dangers in Coa&s;ting <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and a great part of <HI>Arabia,</HI> we knew by the Snakes we &s;aw at Sea, a kind of &s;pungy Froth floating in great abundance on the Water, which pricks, and makes the Hands of tho&s;e that touch it burn, that we were not far from the main Land of <HI>India;</HI> we kept Sailing by many &s;mall I&s;lands, of which tho&s;e Seas are plenty, till we made <HI>Daman,</HI> a Town be|longing to the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> who have &s;trengthened it with a con&s;iderable Fort: It lies in 20 Degrees North Latitude. From this Town to Cape <HI>Comorin</HI> is a range of very high Hills along the Coa&s;t, yet this Town has no other Harbour but a little Cha|nel which remains almo&s;t dry when the Tide is out. Here refre&s;hing our &s;elves, we took the advantage of an Ea&s;terly Gale, and weighing Anchor bore a|way Northward, having no more than five Fathom and an half Water in an Hours Sailing; but then coming into deeper Water we Sailed more boldly, and came up with the Bar of <HI>Surat,</HI> in 6 Fathom and an half Water: Here the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e-Officers came aboard us, and narrowly &s;earch'd and view|ed every thing they had an opportunity to &s;ee; af|ter that Boats came to fetch off the Pa&s;&s;engers and their Goods, and we were had to the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and again &s;earched in a very odd manner. The
<PB N="120" REF="67"> entrance for Ve&s;&s;els of Burthen is very difficult, and we were a ground twice before the Tide could car|ry us in; we pa&s;&s;ed then by the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Surat</HI> on our Right Hand, and dropped our Anchor before the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus being happily at Land, after a two Months trouble&s;ome Voyage, I and others re&s;ted and refre&s;h|ed our &s;elves. The Bar, &s;o called, by rea&s;on of Sands, and is 6 French Leagues or more from <HI>Su|rat,</HI> yet their Ships of great Burthrn mu&s;t unload before they can come up the River.</P>
<P>Being impatient to &s;ee <HI>Surat,</HI> of which I had heard &s;o much di&s;cour&s;e at home. I went in a Boat on the River with divers other Pa&s;&s;engers, but by rea&s;on of the Stream being again&s;t us, we were a con&s;iderable time e'er we reached the Town; and the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e being open, upon the Signal gi|ven we came on Shoar, without which we might not do it: then pa&s;&s;ing a large Court, we entered into a Hall, where the Cu&s;tomer waited to have us &s;earched.</P>
<P>The manner of their &s;earching, as I &s;aid, is odd, and very &s;trict, they making their &s;earch from Head to Foot, feeling your Nakedne&s;s in every part, looking al&s;o into your Mouth, as if they would tell you your Age by your Teeth; and the Waiter demands of every Pa&s;&s;enger, as his Fee, an Aba&s;&s;y, which is worth about 18<HI>d.</HI> and the Bark has half a Roupe, which is about 14<HI>d.</HI> a Head for every Pa&s;&s;enger. If they find one &s;mugling in the lea&s;t, he is fined &s;everely, if not Caved. All the Baggage is brought into the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e to be &s;earched, and when that is done, every one is called in his turn, to pay, and take them away for Money; they take two and an half <HI>per Cent.</HI> for Merchants Goods, of Chri&s;tians four, and of the <HI>Banians</HI> five <HI>per Cent.</HI></P>
<P><HI>India</HI> is a very large Country, of which I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omething, before I enter upon particulars. It is bounded on the We&s;t with the River <HI>Indus,</HI> on the Ea&s;t with <HI>China,</HI> on the North with <HI>Tartary,</HI> on
<PB N="121" REF="67"> the South with the Ocean, and is properly divided into two divi&s;ions, <HI>viz. India intra Gangem,</HI> and <HI>In|dia extra Gangem;</HI> the fir&s;t contains nine Kingdoms, <HI>viz. Nar&s;inga, Malavar, Balla&s;ia, Cambaia, Mandao, Bengala, Ari&s;tan, Comora,</HI> and <HI>Dellia.</HI> The &s;econd, &s;even, <HI>viz. Macine, Aracan, Couchin-Chian, Baram, Siam, Pegue, Malavar.</HI> The whole Country &s;eems to take its denomination from the va&s;t River <HI>Indus,</HI> which runs 1000 Miles e'er it falls into the Sea; and the Empire of the Great Mogul is the Prin|ciple, many of the others being petty Kings, &s;ome of them paying him Tribute, and his Territories are u&s;ually called the <HI>Moguli&s;tan.</HI> The pre&s;ent Great Mogul is held to de&s;cend directly from the line of <HI>Tamarlan</HI> the <HI>Tartar,</HI> who&s;e Succe&s;&s;ors &s;etled in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and took to them&s;elves the Name of <HI>Moguls,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h them from tho&s;e to whom that Prince left <HI>Zagalay, Per&s;ia, Coraffau,</HI> with o|ther Countries to be Govern'd after him; and they concluding this Name would contribute to the Glo|ry of the Family, becau&s;e the People would be the more ea&s;ily per&s;waded they are of the Race of the great <HI>Gingui&s;can,</HI> the fir&s;t Emperour of the Ancient <HI>Moguls.</HI> It has been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively maintained for ma|ny Generations, and is a mighty Empire e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>Mogul,</HI> is was anciently the Name of a mighty People Inhabiting a Country at the extrea|mity of <HI>Ea&s;t-Tartary,</HI> inclining towards the North, which others have called <HI>Mongul</HI> and <HI>Mongal,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Moguli&s;tan,</HI> where <HI>Gingui&s;can</HI> was Born, and that Emperour reduced it wholly under his Obedience, before he proceeded to the Conque&s;t of the re&s;t of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> and both him&s;elf and Subjects were called <HI>Moguls.</HI> The Great Mogul is &s;aid to carry 300000 Hor&s;e into the Field with him when he makes War, be&s;ide a con&s;iderable Army of Foot; yet the mo&s;t knowing <HI>Indians</HI> &s;ay, though he pays &s;o many, there is not above half of them in Arms at once. The great Men that Command, u&s;ually, for their own advantage, it being the mo&s;t they have to live on,
<PB N="122" REF="68"> double the Mu&s;ter-Roll. He has in his Dominions, 20 Provinces or Governments, and tho&s;e that have made them more, have mi&s;taken, by making two of one.</P>
<P>The true bounds of his Empire to the We&s;t, are, <HI>Macram,</HI> or <HI>Sinde,</HI> and <HI>Candabar:</HI> On the Ea&s;t it reaches to the River <HI>Ganges;</HI> on the South it is li|mitted by the Gulf of <HI>Bengala,</HI> the great Sea, and <HI>Decan;</HI> on the North by a part of <HI>Tartary.</HI> It ex|tends from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, above 400 Leagues, and from North to South 500; and this va&s;t &s;pace, &s;ome Mountains and De&s;arts excepted, is very much repleni&s;hed with Cities, Towns, Ca&s;tles, Boroughs, and plea&s;ant Villages; and the Country about them very fruitful in Corn, Rice, Fruits, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the Province of <HI>Guzerat,</HI> in this Empire, is the Town of <HI>Surat,</HI> of which I have &s;poke &s;ome|thing already. It lies in 22 Degrees 7 Minutes North Latitude, watered by the River <HI>Tapty.</HI> The Walls were formerly of Earth, but they are fram|ing now of Brick, 2 Fathom and an half thick, and of the &s;ame heighth, being cautioned &s;o to do for its better defence, upon its being plundered by <HI>Raja Savegi,</HI> who made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of great Riches, though he took not the Ca&s;tle, nor was able to force the Factories of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> who had Fortified them with Cannon, and making a &s;tout defence, &s;aved their Goods from the &s;poil. This <HI>Raja</HI> had his Government in the Mountains, and did great mi&s;chiefs in <HI>India;</HI> though <HI>Aurenzeb,</HI> the Mogul, or Emperor, did all he could to prevent it.</P>
<P>In building the new Wall, a great many Hou&s;es are left out of the Town, e&s;pecially tho&s;e built of Cane. When the Mou&s;&s;on, or Mon&s;on, a Wind that &s;erves for Trade of Shiping, blows, the Town is full of People, &s;o that 'tis difficult to get any Lodging: and this is in <HI>January, February, March,</HI> part of <HI>April,</HI> and &s;ometimes all that Month.</P>
<P>It is Inhabited by <HI>Indians, Per&s;ians, Arabians, Ar|menians, Turks, European</HI> Chri&s;tians, and &s;ome few other Nations; though the proper Inhabitants are
<PB N="123" REF="68"> divided into 3 Orders; the fir&s;t of the&s;e include the <HI>Indian Moors,</HI> and others of the <HI>Mahometan</HI> Religi|on; the &s;econd are <HI>Gentils,</HI> or Heathens, who adore Idols, the third are the <HI>Par&s;is,</HI> who are likewi&s;e cal|led <HI>Guares,</HI> or <HI>Artechpire&s;t,</HI> adorers of Fire, profe&s;|&s;ing the Religion of the ancient <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> and the&s;e retired into <HI>India,</HI> when <HI>Caylif Oman</HI> reduced <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> under the Power of the <HI>Mahometans.</HI> The <HI>Banians</HI> are here the riche&s;t Merchants, &s;ome of them being held to be worth 8 Millions of Crowns. The <HI>Dutch</HI> particularly, among other <HI>Europeans,</HI> have driven a great Trade here, as did the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and the&s;e had Hou&s;es a&s;&s;igned them for their Factories, called Lodges, very neatly built.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle is built on the &s;ide of the River <HI>Tapty,</HI> and is a Fort of moderate bigne&s;s, and of good &s;trength; it &s;tands at the South end of the Town, and defends the Entry again&s;t tho&s;e that would at|tack it. It is &s;quare, and flanked at each corner with large Towers: The Ditches on 3 &s;ides are filled with the Sea Water, and the 4th which is on the We&s;t, is wa&s;hed by the River. In this Ca|&s;tle the Mogul's Revenues gathered in the Province are kept, and never &s;ent to Court without Order.</P>
<P>On the We&s;t &s;ide there is a &s;tately Gate to enter at, which is in the <HI>Bazar</HI> or <HI>Meiden,</HI> and this Ca|&s;tle has a particular Governor, and the Town has another. The Hou&s;es of the Rich are but meanly built, of Timber, Brick, Lime, and Tiles, and mo&s;t of the&s;e being fetched a great way renders building very dear, by rea&s;on there is no Stone in this Pro|vince: They make their Laths of Bambous Cane, and they chu&s;e, by rea&s;on of the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the Sun, which drys and craks &s;o fa&s;t, to build when it Rains, rather than in dry weather. As for the Hou&s;es of the ordinary &s;ort they are made of Cane, and covered with Palm branches. The Streets are large and even, but not Paved. They &s;pare the Oxen here to Till the Land, and carry Burthens, feeding on Cow-Beef, e&s;pecially for the mo&s;t part; they have good Mutton, and abundance
<PB N="124" REF="69"> of Poultry, and eat with their Meats the Oyl of <HI>Cnicus Sylve&s;tris,</HI> or wild Saffron, the be&s;t in the <HI>In|dies;</HI> al&s;o that of <HI>Se&s;amum,</HI> which is common, but not &s;o good. They have white and red Grapes there, but they make an eager and unplea&s;ant Wine, becau&s;e the heat is &s;o exce&s;&s;ive they have not delibe|ration enough to ripen; nor is the &s;trong Waters drunk there much better; it is made of <HI>Jagre,</HI> a a kind of cour&s;e black Sugar di&s;&s;olved in Water, with the brui&s;ed Bark of the Baboul-Tree, and &s;o Di&s;tilled.</P>
<P>They make &s;trong Water likewi&s;e of Tary, and draw a Brandy from Rice, Sugar and Dates, which, however, is but very &s;orry &s;tuff, and kills many of the <HI>Europeans,</HI> who coming a long Voyage, too &s;ud|denly fa&s;ten on tho&s;e Liquors and drink intempe|rately. They infu&s;e the&s;e ingredients likewi&s;e in Water, and by &s;etting them in the Sun make Vine|gar.</P>
<P>At <HI>Surat</HI> are &s;old all &s;orts of Stuffs and Cotten Cloth that are made in the <HI>Indies,</HI> likewi&s;e a great many <HI>European</HI> Commodities, and tho&s;e of <HI>China,</HI> as Purceline, Cabinets, and Coffers, adorned with Turquois, Agats, Cornelian, Ivory, and all &s;orts of Embelli&s;hments; here are Diamonds, Rubies, Pearls, and mo&s;t &s;ort of precious Stones that are found in the Ea&s;tern Country; al&s;o Amber, Musk, Myrrh, Frankincen&s;e, Manna, Sal Armoniac, Lac, Indico, Quick-&s;ilver; the Root Raenus for Dying Red, and all &s;orts of Spices and Fruits that are to be found in the <HI>Indies,</HI> and other Countries of <HI>Levant;</HI> and here Merchants buy up Drugs to tran&s;port into all parts of the World; &s;o that this Town, though not large, may be &s;aid to be the Emporium of the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>Having pretty well viewed this place, and taken &s;uch things as I was informed were nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch hot Countries as remained for me to Travel in, and con&s;idering <HI>Amedabad</HI> was the Chief City of <HI>Guzerat,</HI> I directed my Journey to take a view of it. This Province, a few Ages &s;ince was an entire King|dom,
<PB N="125" REF="69"> Govern'd by <HI>Mudafer,</HI> a young Prince, who by the advice of his Guardian, called in <HI>Mogul Ech|bar,</HI> to make his party good again&s;t the great Men who were trouble&s;om to him; but the Mogul get|ting &s;trong footing, impri&s;oned him and his Guar|dian, where they died mi&s;erably, and &s;eized the Kingdom, annexing it as a Province to his Empire, and it is the plea&s;ante&s;t of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> though not the large&s;t, for it is well watered with the Rivers <HI>Nar|dabad</HI> and <HI>Tapty,</HI> with &s;ome other Rivers of le&s;&s;er Note, &s;o that the Fields look green all the Year, by rea&s;on of the Corn and Rice that cover them, and the various kinds of Trees that continually bear Blo&s;&s;oms and Fruit.</P>
<P>Setting out from <HI>Surat,</HI> with &s;ome others in com|pany, I Travelled Northward, and 2 Hours after cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Tapty</HI> in a Ferry, as I did the River <HI>Kim,</HI> near the Town of <HI>Beriao,</HI> and came to <HI>Oucli&s;&s;er,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing the River <HI>Nardabad,</HI> arrived at <HI>Baroche,</HI> di|&s;tant from <HI>Surat,</HI> and the Sea, about 10 French Lea|gues, or 20 <HI>Indian</HI> Co&s;&s;es, which is a mea&s;ure a|mong&s;t them of about half a League. This Town lies about 22 Degrees North Latitude; it has a large &s;quare Fortre&s;s &s;tanding on a Hill, and the Town lies upon the &s;ide, near the Foot of it, looking to|wards the River <HI>Nardabad,</HI> encompa&s;&s;ed with a Stone Wall 2 Fathom high, flanked with Towers between 30 and 35 paces di&s;tant one from another, and is the &s;tronge&s;t in the Province. The <HI>Bazar,</HI> or Market-place is a large Street at the Foot of the Hill, where are made the Cotton Stuffs, called Baf|tas. Here are Mo&s;ques and Temples of the Hea|thens, with Pagods or Idols in them, to who&s;e &s;en&s;ele&s;s Shrines they pay devout Adoration. Here are plenty of Agats, and al&s;o a bundance of Peacocks.</P>
<P>Leaving this place, I continued my Journey Northward, and came to the little Town of <HI>Sour|ban,</HI> 7 Leagues from <HI>Baroche,</HI> and cro&s;&s;ing the Brook <HI>Dader,</HI> and &s;everal little Villages, I entered <HI>Debea,</HI> where a barbarous &s;ort of People Inhabit, who, a few Years &s;ince fed on Man's Fle&s;h, &s;elling it pub|lickly
<PB N="126" REF="70"> at their Shambles, &s;o that Strangers always go armed here for fear of being robbed and mi&s;chief|ed by them, which made us make but a &s;hort &s;tay; but pa&s;&s;ing the Lake, or River <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> we came to <HI>Pe&s;nad,</HI> about 7 Leagues from <HI>Debea,</HI> and &s;aw in our way 2 great <HI>Tanqueze,</HI> and a number of Mon|kies, who came and cro&s;&s;ed us in the Road, fearle&s;s of our &s;houts, but rather mockingly an&s;wered us a|gain, crying <HI>Pou, Pou;</HI> the Tanquiez are &s;tanding Ponds, or re&s;ervatories for Rain Water, paved at the bottom, and kept very choicely. Leaving this place I Travelled with my Company to <HI>Sou&s;entra,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Mader,</HI> which place is very Woody, and there the Monkies were in greater numbers than be|fore, in the Fields, Roads, and on the Trees; and Travelling 5 Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">gues from this place, I came to <HI>Gilbag,</HI> where I met a great many <HI>Collies,</HI> a People of the ca&s;t off <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who wander up and down, and have no fixed Habitation; their chief bu&s;ine&s;s being to pick the Cotton Wooll. In <HI>Gilbag</HI> there is a hand&s;om Garden that belongs to the Mogul, and in it are kept a number of Peacocks: it is fine|ly Watered, and well Planted with Fruit-Trees, and from hence it is two Leagues to <HI>Amedabad,</HI> to which I went the next Morning.</P>
<P>This, as I &s;aid, is the chief City of the Province, and is about 86 Co&s;&s;es or h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">lf French Leagues from <HI>Surat,</HI> and the Sea. It is Govern'd by an <HI>Omra,</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Lord, under the Mogul: It lies 23 Degrees and &s;ome Minutes North Latitude, on a lovely Plain, and is watered by the River <HI>Sabremetty,</HI> which when the Rains fall, much overflows the Plains. There are large Gardens, enclo&s;ed with fine Brick Walls; the&s;e Gardens have re&s;ervatories for Water, and each of them a fine Pavillon at the entrance, and at the end of mo&s;t of them there are conveni|ent Lodgings. The Hou&s;es in the Suburbs are &s;cattering, and many ancient Tombs are to be &s;een about the City, into which you enter by a &s;traight large Street; the Walls are pretty &s;trong, compo&s;ed of Stone and Brick, flanked with great round Tow|ers
<PB N="127" REF="70"> and Battlements. It is about a League and an half in length, and has 12 Gates, which are &s;trictly watched, for fear of a &s;urprize from the <HI>Raja,</HI> of <HI>Bandour,</HI> who&s;e Territories are near, but almo&s;t in inacce&s;&s;ible Mountains, which gives him an oppor|tunity to make inroads thereabouts, and &s;afely to re|tire with much Booty, not regarding the Mogul. In this City are many curious Arches, and large Squares. There is a Kervan&s;erai in the <HI>Meidan,</HI> fur|ni&s;hed with curious Balcony-Lodgings, &s;upported with Pillars; and the King has a Pallace in this City of curious Work, where the Mu&s;icians re&s;ort to Play on their In&s;truments Morning, Noon, Evening, and Midnight, for which they have a Sallary allow|ed them; in the Apartments there are &s;everal Orna|ments of Folages covered Gold; there is the <HI>Juma, Me&s;gid,</HI> or <HI>Fridays,</HI> whither on that Day the People all Flock; it is very beautiful, and is the faire&s;t of all others, though there are many more; on the out|&s;ide of each Gate is a fine Steeple, with a Balcony, where the <HI>Mue&s;ins,</HI> or Bedles, with their thunder|ing Voices call the People to the Mo&s;que, for in this Country they have no Bells; and when they repair hither they appear very devout, for I &s;aw above 400 <HI>Faquirs</HI> who held their Arms cro&s;s behind their Heads without &s;tirring all the Prayer-time. I vi&s;ited ano|ther Mo&s;que which had been a Pagod Temple, be|fore <HI>Aureng-Zebe</HI> cau&s;ed a Cow to be killed in it, which cau&s;ed the <HI>Gentiles</HI> to for&s;ake it. It has a|bundance of Figures of naked Women in it, &s;itting after the Oriental fa&s;hion, as al&s;o, of Men, Bea&s;ts, and Mon&s;terous Creatures; but they are &s;omewhat disfigured by their No&s;es being cut off, which <HI>Au|reng-Zebe</HI> cau&s;ed to be done out of a pretended Zeal. which rai&s;ed him to the Throne over the Heads of his Father and two elder Brothers.</P>
<P>In this City is the place where the famed Magi|cian was Buried, whom many of the <HI>Indians</HI> hold for a great Saint, and vi&s;it his Tomb with great Devotion: It is a &s;quare pile of Building, having on each &s;ide &s;everal little Domes&s;etting off a great one
<PB N="128" REF="71"> the middle. The entry into it is by 7 Ports that take up the whole Front; the Pavings is Marble, the Doors are of the &s;ame, inlaid with Chri&s;tal and Mother-Pearle: The Tomb is like a bed, covered with Cloth of Gold, and over it 7 Canopies of dif|ferent coloured Silk, one higher than another: The Pavement is u&s;ually &s;trowed with white Flowers, which the devout <HI>Mahometans</HI> bring when they come to &s;ay their Prayers at the Tomb.</P>
<P>Near to the Burying-place of the Ancient Kings of <HI>Guzerat,</HI> which is a very fine Building, and curi|ous Arched Vaults under it, where the A&s;hes of the Dead are in Urns, is the Sepulcher of a Cow, un|der a Dome, &s;tanding on 6 Pillars, but either they knew not, or declined to tell me the rea&s;on why &s;he was buried there, but at another place I heard, one of their Kings was driven out by the People, who flying to the Mountains, was there &s;upported by the Cow's Milk till he was recalled, whereupon dying &s;oon after, he left a Pention to keep this Cow &s;o long as &s;he &s;hould live, with Commands, that &s;he &s;hould be Buried in this manner when &s;he Died; and the People on certain Days go to the Sepulchers of their Kings to bewail their lo&s;s.</P>
<P>The next thing I vi&s;ited, was a famed Well, 8 Story de&s;cending, every Story &s;upported with Arches and Pillars; it is 4 Fathom broad, and about 24 long; very light&s;ome, having in it curious Springs. They &s;ay it was built by a King's Nur&s;e, and co&s;t 20 Millions of Roupies, but I believe a great deal le&s;s fini&s;hed it.</P>
<P>Though &s;ome may think it &s;trange, and &s;cruple crediting it, yet certain it is, here the Gentile <HI>In|dians</HI> have an Ho&s;pial for &s;ick Bea&s;ts, and another for Birds, which they feed and look after till they are well, and then they &s;ell them to their own Sect, but not <HI>Mahometans,</HI> whom they count Cruel, be|cau&s;e they mi&s;-u&s;e and kill Creatures, and often they buy them out of their Hands at dear rates, pure|ly out of a charitable compa&s;&s;ion to &s;ave the poor Creatures Life, for they hold it a Sin to kill any
<PB N="129" REF="71"> thing. Near this City are large Forre&s;ts, in which they take Panthers, and the Governor has tho&s;e that teach them to be tame and tractable, and then he &s;ends them to the King as pre&s;ents to divert him in Hunting. I &s;aw likewi&s;e a Bea&s;t there that had the Head of a Coney, the Ears, Eyes and Teeth of a Hare, the Muzzle round and Fle&s;h coloured, the Tail of a Squirrel, in the fore Feet it had four Fin|gers, and a Claw in the place of the Fi&s;t; the hinder Feet had 5 Toes, each of which were long as well as the Claws; the &s;oles of its Feet flat, and like an Apes, of a Fle&s;h colour; its Hair on the &s;ides, long, cour&s;e, and of a dark red, but greyi&s;h on the Belly, like the Wool of a Hair; and from Head to Rump, about a Foot and an half long; few could tell what to make of it; they told me it was brought from <HI>Moca,</HI> yet, probably, it was no other than a Squirril. The Commodities mo&s;tly traded for here are, Vel|vets, Skins, Taffatas, Tape&s;tries, with Gold, Silk, and Woollen Grounds, Cotton, Cloth, Indico dried and pre&s;erved, Ginger, Sugar, Cinamon Tama|rines, Mirabalans, Cumin, Lac, Saltpetre, Opium, Honey, and &s;ome Schites, or painted Cloth.</P>
<P><HI>Cambay</HI> being in this Province, by the Sea, I re&s;ol|ved to vi&s;it it, but on my way found little worth mentioning. Let it &s;uffice then that I arrived there. This Town lies at the bottom of a Gulf of the &s;ame Name, which is very dangerous for large Ve&s;&s;els to come in, by rea&s;on of the Flats, and banks of Sand, and for tho&s;e of le&s;s force by rea&s;on the <HI>Malabar</HI> Pirates lie &s;heltering under the Rocks to &s;urprize them. This Town is much larger than <HI>Surat,</HI> tho' not near &s;o Populous, for the cau&s;es I mentioned. The Walls are Brick, about 4 Fathom high, with Towers at certain di&s;tances. The Streets are large, and have all Gates at the ends of them which are kept clo&s;e &s;hut at Night. The Hou&s;es are very high, built of Bricks baked in the Sun, and the Shops are &s;tored with Aromatick Perfumes, Spices, Silks, Stuffs Ivory, Bracelets, Agat, Cups, Caphlets, and Rings: The Agats are got out of a Quarry, near
<PB N="130" REF="72"> a Village called <HI>Nimodra,</HI> about 4 Leagues from from <HI>Cambaya.</HI> Mo&s;t part of the Inhabitants are <HI>Banians</HI> and <HI>Ra&s;pouts.</HI></P>
<P>The Ca&s;tle where the Governor re&s;ides is large, but not beautiful. In this Town there are &s;o many Monkies, that &s;ometimes the Hou&s;es are covered over with them, as it were a Dovecot, and the&s;e mi&s;|chievous Creatures never fail to hurt one or other in the Streets, if they can find any thing to throw at them. There are many Gardens about this Town, and a &s;tately Marble Tomb is to be &s;een very anci|ent, and the Building about it &s;uitable, adorned with Porphery Pillars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> There are the Ruins of other old Tombs to be &s;een near it, held to be tho&s;e of Ancient Kings. The Suburbs are near as big as the Town, and great &s;tore of Indico is made there. As one Travels from this place there is great danger of Robbers who lie concealed, and by a &s;light throw a noo&s;e about a Man's Neck, pull him down, and &s;trangle him in a trice, and &s;o rifle him, and therefore it is proper to go in a good company, though there is a cu&s;tom to carry a <HI>Techeron</HI> Man and Woman with them, who declare to the Robbers, that the Party is under their Protection, and if they injure them, the Man prote&s;ts to cut his own Throat, and the Woman &s;hows them a Rai&s;or, with which &s;hew vows to cut off her Brea&s;t, and this they &s;ay, has often deter'd the Thieves from offering violence to Travellers, becau&s;e the Heathens who are mo&s;tly the Robbers, look on it as a horrid and unpardona|ble Crime to be guilty of the Death of a <HI>Techeron,</HI> becau&s;e, ever after, the Party who is the cau&s;e of it is hated by his Ca&s;t, and turned out of the Tribe, and continually upbraided with the Death of a <HI>Gentil,</HI> though I could not under&s;tand this takes now adays, for few of them will kill them&s;elves, though they prote&s;t it, but have a cunning fetch to excu&s;e it, al|ledging, after they have whi&s;pered with the Rob|bers, they have compounded, and &s;o get Money out of Chri&s;tians, which no doubt they &s;nack be|tween them.</P>

<P> This Province has &s;everal other con&s;iderable Towns, as <HI>Goga,</HI> on the other &s;ide the Gulf, be|tween 20 and 30 Leagues from <HI>Cambaye, Patan</HI> ly|ing more Southward, towards the great Sea, where many Silks and Stuffs are made: It is defended by a Fort, and has a Fine Mo&s;que in it, which was for|merly an Idol Temple.</P>
<P><HI>Diu,</HI> belonging to the <HI>Portugue&s;es,</HI> fortified with 3 Ca&s;tles, at the Siege of which, an Army &s;ent by the la&s;t Sultan but one of <HI>Aegypt,</HI> named <HI>Camp&s;on Gaurus,</HI> peri&s;hed, and Sultan <HI>Solyman</HI> the great Em|peror of the <HI>Turks,</HI> &s;ending another Army under <HI>So|lyman</HI> Ba&s;&s;a, which was joyned by a va&s;t power of <HI>Indians;</HI> the valliant <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Governor named <HI>Siveira,</HI> &s;o well defended it, that after a long Battery, they were forced to rai&s;e the Siege, and leave their Tents, Artillery, and Ammunition, with 1000 wounded Men in their Camp, though the <HI>Turks</HI> in their Pa&s;&s;age, had &s;eized <HI>Aden</HI> by Trea|chery, and &s;trangled the King of that place. At <HI>Diu</HI> is made the Stone <HI>Cobra,</HI> &s;o famous for antedot|ing the biting or &s;tinging of Serpents; it is com|po&s;ed of the A&s;hes of a burnt Root, mingled with a kind of an Earth they get under the Rocks, and making the&s;e into a Pa&s;te, they form the Stone of it; then they prick the Wound, and letting a lit|tle Blood out, they apply the Stone, leaving it till it falls off of it &s;elf; it has the &s;ame effect on Wounds made by Poy&s;on'd Weapons, and after that put into Womans, or Cows Milk, it leaves the Poy|&s;on it has &s;ucked in, and if it be not &s;o u&s;ed, it will bur&s;t.</P>
<P>There are two other Towns of Note in this Pro|vince, <HI>viz.

The in|come of this Province to the Mogul's Trea&s;ury is accounted Twenty millions and five hundred thou|&s;and French Livres yearly.</P>
<P>Travelling on, I entred the Province of <HI>Agra,</HI> which I reckoned the large&s;t in the Mogul's Ter|ritories;
<PB N="132" REF="73"> <HI>Agra,</HI> which gives it the Name is the Capi|tal Town in it. It is di&s;tant from <HI>Surat</HI> 210 Leagues, and is &s;eated on the River <HI>Gemna,</HI> in 28 Degrees and an half, North Latitude. The River has its &s;ource in the Mountains to the North of <HI>Dehly,</HI> and increa&s;ing by the way, it is here con&s;iderable, and pa&s;&s;ing through large Countries, empties it &s;elf into the great River <HI>Ganges,</HI> at the Town of <HI>Halbas.</HI></P>
<P>Mogul <HI>Ecbar</HI> made <HI>Agra</HI> a City, it being before but a Borough, and e&s;tabli&s;hing the Seat of his Em|pire there, called it <HI>Ecbar Abad,</HI> or the Habitation of <HI>Ecbar,</HI> joyning &s;everal Villages by other Build|ings to enlarge it: He fortified it very well with a Ca&s;tle and Walls of great heighth and &s;trength, and had his Pallace in the Ca&s;tle, containing 3 Courts with Porches, adorned with Gilding and Painting; nay, &s;ome pieces plated with Ma&s;&s;y Gold. There are many &s;tately Sepulchers, Baths, Pillars, and o|ther things of great Antiquity. And here <HI>Aureng Zebe</HI> Impri&s;oned <HI>Cha-Gehan,</HI> his Father, when he mounted to the Throne, and in that confinement he died, who has a little Sepulcher erected to his Me|mory. There are in <HI>Agra</HI> a great many Chri&s;tian Families; &s;ome reckon 5000, but the computation is not agreed on. The <HI>Dutch</HI> hold a Factory in this Town, and for the greater encouragement of Tra|vellers, the <HI>Four&s;dar,</HI> an Officer in the nature of a Sheriff, is obliged to make re&s;titution to tho&s;e that are Robbed, and this is punctually ob&s;erved in all, or mo&s;t of the Provinces.</P>
<P>Here are Elephants, Antelopes, Leopards, and o|ther Bea&s;ts that they u&s;e in their Games for fighting. I &s;aw here Green Pidgeons, and the <HI>Indians</HI> have a cunning way to catch them in the Water, for they go into the Rivers Naked, and keep their Bodies un|der Water, their Heads only remaining above, which is covered with a Cap of Feathers in the Form of a Water-Fowl, &s;o without &s;caring them, draw them under Water by the Legs.</P>
<P>In the Mountains, about 5 days Journey from hence, they Hunt, and take &s;tore of <HI>Merovers,</HI> or
<PB N="133" REF="73"> wild Cows, of which Hunting they make great advantage. Their Pictures in <HI>Agra</HI> are pretty well done, but mo&s;tly in bandy Po&s;tures, exceeding Active, being purpo&s;ely drawn to &s;tir up lacivious de&s;ires, and therefore I &s;hall pa&s;s them over. The <HI>Agrians</HI> are the be&s;t Workmen I ever met withal in working Gold on Agat, Chri&s;tal, and other brittle things, which few of our Lapidaries, or Gold&s;miths can do, or if they can, fall &s;hort in equalling them.</P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ing from <HI>Agra,</HI> I came to <HI>Fetipour,</HI> once the Seat of the Empire, but now not much con&s;iderable, except for its lovely Meidan and Mo&s;que; the entry of <HI>Ecbar</HI>'s Pallace, and &s;ome &s;tately Pillars &s;catter|ed up and down; it was &s;lighted, as they &s;ay, be|cau&s;e all the Springs about it were bracki&s;h, and un|whole&s;ome. I was informed, in this Province there are upwards of 3400 Towns and Villages, of which, next to what I have named, the&s;e are the Chief, <HI>viz. Bernzabad, Chitopour, Bargant, Mirda, Hindon, Ladono, Chalaour, Byana, Canova,</HI> and <HI>Scan|derbade,</HI> mo&s;t of the&s;e produce Manufactures of Stuffs, Silks, Tape&s;try, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Revenues of this Province mount very near to that of <HI>Guzerat.</HI></P>
<P>Next we entered the Province of <HI>Dehly</HI> by difficult ways, becau&s;e the Rains had made the Rivers &s;well in many places. It bounds on <HI>Agra</HI> to the North; and <HI>Dehly,</HI> the Principal Town of the Province is about 45 Lergues from <HI>Agra,</HI> and Mogul <HI>Cah Gehan,</HI> and <HI>Aureng Zeb,</HI> made it the Royal Seat of the Em|pire; the way is all along planted with curious Trees in a Line, and each half League is marked with a kind of a Turret, and there are convenien|cies by the way for Travellers to &s;helter and re&s;t in: There is by the way likewi&s;e, an ancient Heathen Temple, vi&s;ited by the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who provide ne|ce&s;&s;aries for a great many Apes that are kept there, and they pay a kind of a blind Devotion to them, as the Creatures of the Pagods. <HI>Dehly</HI> &s;eems to be compo&s;ed of certain Villages, and there is the Ruins of a Town, which the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;ay, was the Regal Seat of King <HI>Porus,</HI> famed in Hi&s;tory for the Wars
<PB N="134" REF="74"> he maintained again&s;t <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great. There is to be &s;een a Piramid or Obelisk of Stone, with an In&s;cription in very ancient Characters, which they &s;ay, <HI>Alexander</HI> erected in Memory of his Victory over <HI>Porus,</HI> but the Character not being <HI>Greek</HI> ren|ders it doubtful.</P>
<P>This City lies in an open Champion Country, wa&s;hed by the River <HI>Gemna,</HI> it has a Fortre&s;s half a League in circumference, with a &s;trong Wall, and a round Tower, every 10 Battlements being &s;ecured by a Ditch wharfed with Stone, and a Garden round it.

<P>They have Elks and Rhinocero&s;es here that are as large as Oxen; they have many Bufflers, and they breed up Dogs brought from <HI>Bengala,</HI> who are held to have been originally brought from <HI>England,</HI> for their pa&s;time in hunting Lyons, and other furi|ous Wild Bea&s;ts.

<P>The <HI>Indians,</HI> as well as the <HI>Moors,</HI> often kill them in the Mountains for their Teeth, they having two exceeding large ones: Some are found Dead with their Trunks off a good way, and this misfortune happens to them when they go to Water at <HI>Ganges,</HI> or <HI>Indus,</HI> which Rivers are pe&s;tered with huge Cro|codiles, who bite off the ends of their Trunks, when they dip them in the Water, and &s;o the poor Bea&s;t is &s;tarved for want of wherewithal to feed it &s;elf.

<P>They have a Bea&s;t here no bigger than a Hare, which has on its Belly a &s;welling, or Bladder, that fills with corrupt Blood, which being taken off be|comes pure Musk, but the Bea&s;t lives not long after it.

<P>The Great Mogul drinks commonly of the Wa|ter of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> though many affirm, that if it be not boiled it cau&s;es a Flux.

<HEAD>CHAP. XIX. <HI>Of the Marriages, Apparrels, Super&s;titious Cu&s;toms, the keeping the</HI> Mogul<HI>'s Birth-Day, and other Things ob&s;erved by the</HI> Indians, <HI>as the Funerals of their Dead,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>HAving de&s;cribed many Things worthy of Note in <HI>India,</HI> I now proceed to others which I pur|po&s;ely omitted, that for Brevity &s;ake I might have the conveniency of collecting and placing them to|gether.</P>
<P>The Marriages of the <HI>Mahometan Indians,</HI> e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e of Note, are celebrated with Pompous &s;hows, and much Magnificency; they are Married by a Moula, or <HI>Mahometan</HI> Prie&s;t, and then the Bride in rich Ornaments, is carried to the Bride|groom's Apartments on an Elephant. The Females Marry very young, as at 8, 9, and 10 years of Age, and &s;ome &s;ooner, but tho&s;e that Marry early leave of Child bearing at 30, and are very much wrink|led. The Wedding Ceremonies of the <HI>Gentil Indi|ans</HI> is this; the Bramen, or Prie&s;t, after having &s;aid
<PB N="142" REF="78"> &s;ome Prayers over the Couple, puts a Cloth be|tween them, and orders the Man with his naked Foot to touch the naked Foot of the Woman, and &s;o the Ceremony is compleated. The Women are very Fruitful in this Country, and ea&s;ily Deli|vered.</P>
<P>As for Aparrel, they wear Cotton, Stuffs, or Silks, as loo&s;e of they can; the Man has Linnen wraped round his Head, like a little clo&s;e Turban, and the Woman a kind of a Carchief, though their Habits, according to the Ca&s;ts, are various, yet of as many Colours as they can have them.</P>
<P>They often do Pennance by Ab&s;tinence, and &s;ome are put in a hole for that purpo&s;e. where, they &s;ay, they remain 6 or 7 Days without Eating or Drink|ing; but this is mo&s;tly in the Temples of their Pa|gods, of which they have numbers, many with va&s;t Labour being cut out of natural Rock, &s;ome like Men, and others very Mon&s;trous: And in &s;ome Pro|vinces great Hills and Rocks, with prodigious co&s;t and pains are cut into &s;uch Forms or Shapes, which &s;hews their Super&s;tition.</P>
<P>At <HI>Bengala,</HI> and other places, they Sacrifice to the Sea, throwing in Coco Nuts, which little Boys &s;wim for, and make much &s;port and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;time in &s;trugling for them, and this they call the opening of the Sea, becau&s;e, for &s;ome Months, Trade is &s;top|ped, by rea&s;on the Moun&s;on, or Trading-Wind, &s;erves not, and this they do with a great deal of De|votion and Solemnity.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;ts, or Tribes of the <HI>Gentil Indians,</HI> are re|coned to be 84, and though they profe&s;s to be all of the &s;ame Religion, yet they differ migntily in their Ceremonies. Every one of the Tribes fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">ow a particular Trade, and their off-&s;pring mu&s;t not quit it under the Penalty of being counted Infamous, and turned out of his Ca&s;t. They are generally very Charitable, e&s;pecially to Strangers in their Sickne&s;s or Di&s;tre&s;s, and will &s;treighten them&s;elves very much to relieve them. The Bramens, who are their Doctors, make the fir&s;t and head Tribe.</P>
<PB N="143" REF="78">
<P> The Mogul's Birth-Day is kept with great Fea&s;t|ing and Rejoycing, and then he is publickly weigh|ed in Golden Scales, and precious Stones tied up in bags are the Weights: The Weight of him is Re|gi&s;tred, and if that Year he weighs more than the former there is great Rejoycing; and for Trifles he gives among&s;t his Nobles and Favourites, he receives a va&s;t Trea&s;ure in Pre&s;ents; if he weighs le&s;s, they conclude him to be Langui&s;hing, which abates much of their Merriment, and that Day particularly, the <HI>Indian</HI> Women adorn their Ears and No&s;es with Rings and Jewels, if they are forced to borrow them, though at other times the better &s;ort wear them; tho&s;e they wear in their Ears are flat, either of Gold, Silver, or Copper.</P>
<P>Among the <HI>Indians</HI> they have a Liquor called Ta|ry, which is the Juyce of a Palm, or Coco Tree, or rather the Sap, which they love &s;o much, that in many places the Women make it in their bargain before they are Married, that they &s;hall be allowed to Drink it, and to go abroad &s;ometimes to &s;ee their Neighbours: It is gotten by wounding the Trees, and ta&s;ts &s;omething like Whitewine. The Coco Nuts are about the bigne&s;s of an ordinary Mellon, and are very much e&s;teemed for the Liquor they produce. The <HI>Dutch</HI> at <HI>Batavia</HI> have a Market kept under the&s;e kind of Trees, and the plea&s;ant|ne&s;s of the Shade brings them in a great income for Standings, be&s;ide the advantage of the Fruit. As for the Swords, Daggers, and other Arms of the <HI>Indians,</HI> except Bows and Arrows, they are heavy and clouterly made, after the ancient Fa&s;hion of the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> There are in <HI>India</HI> many Hermophradites, partaking the Genitals of both Sexes; the&s;e, though they go in Womens Aparrel, wear a Turban on their Heads to di&s;tingui&s;h them, under a great Pe|nalty.</P>
<P>As for the belief of the <HI>Indian Gentiles,</HI> it is, that every Man may be &s;aved in his Religion or Sect, provided he exactly follow the way that God has directed him, affirming, when they bow to Idols,
<PB N="144" REF="79"> they wor&s;hip them not, but have God in their Mind; they &s;ay tho&s;e that take ill cour&s;es will be Damned, and doubt not, but their Religion is the fir&s;t of all Religions, and that it was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the days of <HI>Adam,</HI> and pre&s;erved by <HI>Noah,</HI> believing that there is a Heaven and a Hell, for Rewards and Pu|ni&s;hments, but none &s;hall enter before the Univer|&s;al Judgment: That they &s;how Honour and Re&s;pect to a Cow, becau&s;e &s;he affords them more &s;ub&s;i&s;tance than other Creatures. The <HI>Pythagorian</HI> Doctrine or Opinion of Tran&s;migration of Souls is held by ma|ny of the Ca&s;ts, which makes them refrain killing Bea&s;ts or Birds, lea&s;t the Souls of &s;ome of their Tribe, departed, &s;hould be in them, and they often re&s;cue them by purcha&s;e from the <HI>Mahometans,</HI> who are about to kill them.</P>
<P>They call their God <HI>Ram,</HI> and &s;ay he was pro|duced out of the Light, and in that con&s;ideration, they render him Divine Honours in their P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">gods, and el&s;ewhere. In &s;aluting their Friends they re|peat his Name twice; their Adoration con&s;i&s;ts in joyning their Hands, as if they Prayed and letting them fall very low, then gently rai&s;ing them to their Mouth, and la&s;t of all, over their Heads. They &s;ay <HI>Chitta</HI> was <HI>Ram</HI>'s Wife, and when they &s;ee the Picture of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> they affirm it is <HI>Chitta</HI>'s Repre&s;entation, &s;aluting and bowing very low to it, bringing Offerings of Fruit, Oyl, and Wax-Candles, for none of their Sacrifices are Bloo|dy, but con&s;i&s;t of bringing to their Pagods, things of Ornament, and &s;uch as may be Eaten, and ta|king the Bramen's Directions they anoint the Body of the Image with Oyl and &s;ay their Prayers be|fore the Idol they intend to Invocate, they pre&s;ent their Oblation, and return out of the Temple, and when the Bramen has taken what he thinks fit, the re&s;t is di&s;tributed to tho&s;e of any Religion that will come for it.

This, by the wi&s;e, is looked on as a piece of Prie&s;tcraft, to get the Riches that are found in the A&s;hes, as Gold, Silver, and &s;uch Jewels as re&s;i&s;t the Fire, for the A&s;hes being accounted Sacred, none but the Bramen has the medling with them; and the Woman is counted Infamous among her Ca&s;t that refu&s;es to un|dergo this Cruelty.</P>
<P>Some are buried with their Husbands, up to the Neck, then &s;trangled and quite covered; and &s;ome of the Maids, for the love they bear their Mi&s;tri&s;s, will in like manner accompany her in Death; but this is rarely u&s;ed now, for the Mogul, and other <HI>Mahometan</HI> Princes of <HI>India,</HI> have &s;trictly forbid it, as Inhuman, and Barbarous, which &s;ecures many Women from the Infamy they would otherwi&s;e un|dergo in their Ca&s;t; yet though the Governors pre|tend all that in them lies to re&s;train it, &s;ome are &s;till burnt, for by earne&s;t Sollicitations, and large Pre|&s;ents, if the Wife Petition for it, which &s;ome of them do, leave is obtained; but it is thought they are incited to it by the crafty per&s;wa&s;ions of the knavi&s;h Bramen, who promi&s;es them ine&s;timable Joys and Plea&s;ures in another Life.</P>

<P>IN our Pa&s;&s;age to <HI>China,</HI> for brevity &s;ake, I &s;hall not be particular in every thing I &s;aw, as not be|ing remarkable in &s;uch wild and de&s;art Countries. Let it &s;uffice then, that &s;etting out we pa&s;&s;ed over va&s;t Plains, Rivers, Mountains, and Rockey ways, in danger of wild Bea&s;ts and Robbers, there being but few, and tho&s;e incon&s;iderable Towns, till we came to <HI>Athec,</HI> where recruiting with Provi&s;ions, and refre&s;hing our&s;elves, we Travelled on in much the like ways to <HI>Pa&s;&s;aur,</HI> and &s;o by &s;everal &s;mall Towns till we came to a City called <HI>Capher&s;tam;</HI> the Country it &s;tands in is very Fertil, producing good Wine, and one thing I ob&s;erved, that they go to their Temples in Mourning Weeds; and 25 days Journey from this, we came to <HI>Gtrideli,</HI> in 20 days more to <HI>Cabul,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Ciracar,</HI> and <HI>Paroua,</HI> the la&s;t Town in the Mogul's Territories, after which we were often forced to pay Tribute to petty Princes

<P>As for the va&s;t Kingdom of <HI>China,</HI> it has gone under many Denominations, as the Princes has been plea&s;ed to new Name and call it, as they &s;everally a&s;cended to the Throne: Under the Reign of the fir&s;t King it was called <HI>Tae mim que,</HI> that is, <HI>The Kingdom of great Brightne&s;s,</HI> and by &s;everal other Names.

<PB N="149" REF="82">
<P> The <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> brag much of the Original of their Kingdom, and &s;ome of their Books place it many thou&s;and Years before the Creation of the World; but mo&s;t agree, it has pre&s;erved its form of Govern|ment during the Reign of 22 Families, and from them have de&s;cended 236 Kings, during the &s;pace 4034 Years, for &s;o long they allow it to have been a Kingdom; yet there is among&s;t them another more probable account, <HI>viz.</HI> This account reduces the beginning of it to about 400 Years after the General Deluge, and if any pretend to di&s;pute it by Writing, or word of Mouth, it is enough to en|danger their Lives, for they look upon it as a di&s;pa|ragement to their Kingdom, as being the proude&s;t, and mo&s;t conceited People of all Nations, thinking them&s;elves the be&s;t in the World, and that all others are in&s;ignificant to them, making in their Maps <HI>Chi|na</HI> very &s;pacious, and other Countries like little Rocks in the Sea, and they hold a firm opinion, that <HI>Europe</HI> is no more than 2 &s;mall I&s;lands; they al&s;o hold, all their Neighbours for <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and paint them in Mon&s;trous and Ridiculous Forms, and to make them &s;eem Cowards, though they have often experienced them to the contrary, they report and paint them as little Pigmies, who tie them|&s;elves in bundles when they go abroad, lea&s;t the Ea|gles and Kites &s;hould carry them away; and when any one argues learnedly to them, they &s;tart, as in a &s;urprize, demanding whether they have their Books in their Country, and when the Strangers An&s;wer no, they reply, why then how came you by that Learning? They hold their Religion the pure&s;t and anciente&s;t of all the Religions in the World; How|ever, it is to be believed, that their Chronicle is the anciente&s;t that is to be found, and is &s;o well connect|ed, the Reign of one King hanging &s;o well to the other, that it cannot rea&s;onably be &s;u&s;pected to have been Written upon tru&s;t, by Conjecture, or Imagi|nation.</P>
<P>They divide the Heavens into 28 Con&s;tellations, and <HI>China</HI> into &s;o many parts, allowing each part
<PB N="150" REF="83"> one, and leave none for any other Nation; and in brief, they give their own mo&s;t lofty and magnifi|cent Titles, but to Foreign Countries, mo&s;t barba|rous, &s;cornful, and degrading Names, to exalt their Kingdom by the di&s;paraging others, which Pride I am apt to believe proceeds from their Ignorance, though &s;ome of the Nobles are more moderate and di&s;creet, but then it is &s;uch as have Travelled a|broad, though but a few of them are permitted, and even the&s;e dare not &s;peak much in the prai&s;e of other Countries, lea&s;t they &s;hould be looked on as under|valuers of their own, and con&s;equently as Enemies. Some of their Kings have had the vanity to &s;tile them&s;elves Child of the Sun, and Emperor of the World. They are, however, a very indu&s;trious Peo|ple, as appears by their va&s;t and &s;tately Edifices, Manufactures, and other curious Matters, for there are no idle People in the Kingdom, the Lame, Blind, and Deaf employ them&s;elves in one bu&s;ine&s;s or other, as they are capacitated, and get a living by it, in&s;o|much that they have a Proverb, which &s;ays, <HI>There is nothing in</HI> China <HI>ca&s;t away;</HI> and let it be ne|ver &s;o vile, it may turn to Profit one way or other in the City of <HI>Pekim,</HI> which is the chief of the King|dom. Many thou&s;ands of Families live only by ma|king and &s;elling Card-Matches, and Wicks for Can|dles, and as many by what they pick up about the Streets. They have in every City a Bell, and a Drum-Tower, on which Watchmen &s;trike, to give the Hours, and the quarters in the Night-time, and both the Drum and Bell are exceeding large, being heard many Miles, an&s;wering one another in a Mu|&s;ical Harmony. They burn an Incen&s;e made of Sweet Woods and Perfumes in their Chambers, and before their Pagods, making Candles of the &s;ame and other mixtures, which in burning ca&s;t a fragrant &s;mell; and &s;ome they make &s;o large to place in their Temples before their Idols that they will continue burning 20 or 30 Days and Nights, and burning to certain windings and marks, they, by that, di&s;tin|gui&s;h Hours and Days, in burning &s;uch and &s;uch ex|act
<PB N="151" REF="83"> proportions; and tho&s;e that burn them in their Chambers, when they would ri&s;e at a certain Hour, tie a little Bra&s;s weight by a String to a mark that &s;pecifies the Hour, and the &s;tring burning, the weight falls into a bra&s;s Ba&s;on &s;et under it, and &s;trikes like a Larum-Watch.</P>
<P>They have many other curious devices, as Cha|riots that will run &s;wiftly without Hor&s;es, only a Man that &s;its in it turning a Winch, which by cer|tain Springs turns the Wheels round with great Rapidity. But pa&s;&s;ing over things of this Nature for the pre&s;ent, I will proceed to de&s;cribe, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the City of <HI>Pekim,</HI> the Metropolis of <HI>Chi|na,</HI> where the King has his chief Court.</P>
<P>This famous City is &s;eated in a Plain, forming a va&s;t Square, each of its &s;ides being 12 <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Fur|longs in length; it has 9 Gates, 3 upon the South &s;ide, and 2 upon each of the other &s;ides: it is now Inhabited by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and their Troops are divi|ded into the 8 quarters, or, as they call them, Ban|ners. But con&s;idering, under the preceeding Kings, the numerous Inhabitants had not a &s;ufficient place to contain them, though the Nine Suburbs an&s;wer|ing to the Gates were as big as Cities. There was a new City built like the old one, &s;quare in Form, having its North &s;ide joyning to the &s;ide of the old one; this has 7 Gates, and every one a Suburb an|&s;wering to it, &s;o that taking that in, with the Suburbs, it is of a va&s;t circumference, yet many who have writ of it, have made it much larger than it is; the one and the other are divided into 5 Juri&s;dictions, or Tribunals, of which I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter. The principal Streets run to the 4 direct Points, or Winds; they are long, &s;treight, and broad, &s;o well propor|tioned, as if they had been marked out with a Line. The little Streets run all from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, being very fair, and divide the &s;paces between the great Streets into equal and proportionable I&s;lands, hav|ing each a particular Name, and there is a Catalogue to be &s;old of them, with Notes and Directions, that Strangers, and tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to go on
<PB N="152" REF="84"> Errands, may the ea&s;ier find them, for they are very numerous.</P>
<P>The faire&s;t of the&s;e Streets is called <HI>Cham gan Kiai,</HI> or the Street of Perpetual Repo&s;e; it is about 30 Fathom broad, and of a va&s;t length: The Hou&s;es are low built, which, they &s;ay, is done in re&s;pect to the King's Pallace, that it &s;hould appear more magnificent, though be&s;ides the King's, there are Pallaces belonging to the Nobility very &s;tately, yet they are built backward, &s;o that nothing but a great Gate appears to the Street. The old and new City are crouded with &s;warms of People, as the Shops are with &s;tore of rich Commodities, &s;o that one would &s;uppo&s;e there was a continual Fair held in it.</P>
<P>The King's Pallace is &s;eated in the mid&s;t of the City, and Fronts towards the South, as almo&s;t all others do in this Country; it is encompa&s;&s;ed with a double enclo&s;ure of Walls, in form of a long &s;quare; the outward enclo&s;ure is extraordinary high and thick, plai&s;tered on both &s;ides with a curious red Plai&s;ter, and covered with a &s;mall Roof of varni&s;h|ed Brick of a Gold Colour; the length of it from South to North is 8 <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> Furlongs; it has a Gate in the middle of each &s;ide, compo&s;ed of 3 Portals, the middlemo&s;t never being opened but when the King pa&s;&s;es, and the&s;e have a Guard upon them, but not very con&s;iderable; there are al&s;o many E|lephants kept in a &s;pacious place for &s;ervice, and to divert the King, where are Stables compleatly fur|ni&s;hed for them, and no Per&s;ons that have any con|&s;iderable deformity are &s;uffered to enter the Pallace; the inner Wall that immediately inclo&s;es the Pallace is very thick, and high built, embelli&s;hed with well contrived Battlements, and extends from North to South 6 Furlongs, and a Furlong and an half in breadth, and the Pallace is about four Miles three quarters in circumference; it has 4 Gates with large vaulted Arches, tho&s;e to the South and North being like to them of the fir&s;t Inclo&s;ure, and upon the An|gles of the Walls are 8 Towers of an extraordinary
<PB N="153" REF="84"> bigne&s;s, and good Architecture, Varni&s;hed with beautiful red, and adorned with Flowers of Gold, covered with Tiles of a Gold Varni&s;h, and there are Guards kept in them all, except <HI>Madarin</HI>'s of the Tribunals within the Palace; and the Officers of the King's Hou&s;hold are forbidden to come within this Wall, unle&s;s they &s;hew a little Table of Wood, plated with Ivory, wherein their Names, and the places they &s;erve in are &s;et down, with the Seal of the Mandarin to whom they belong. It has a cu|rious More round it full of Fi&s;h, and every Gate a Draw-Bridge, unle&s;s the South, which lies over an Arch. In the va&s;t &s;pace between the two Walls are many &s;tately Palaces that might &s;uit the entertain|ment of great Kings, they being richly adorned with polli&s;hed Stone, and curious Gilding.</P>
<P>On the Ea&s;t &s;ide clo&s;e by the Wall runs a River, over which are &s;everal Bridges of Marble, with Draw-Bridges in the middle of them: On the We&s;t where the &s;pace is large, there is a lake full of Fi&s;h, 5 Furlongs and a quarter in length, made in the Form of a Ba&s;s-Viol; where it is narrowe&s;t there is a very beautiful Bridge which an&s;wers the Gates of the Wall, at the end of which &s;tand Triumphant Arches of 3 Arches a piece, very Maje&s;tick, and of excellent Workman&s;hip. The Lake is environ|ed with little Pallaces, or Hou&s;es of Plea&s;ure, partly on the Water, and partly on the Land; and on the Lake are many beautiful Barges for the King's u&s;e; the remainder of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t &s;paces not ta|ken up by the Lake, are beautified with Palaces, and the Officers Hou&s;es, all very Stately and Magnifi|cent, as al&s;o of tho&s;e of Artificers that belong to the King's Pallace.</P>
<P>The inward Pallace is low built, according to the fa&s;hion of the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> containing many Pallaces, or Courts, one within the other, &s;o that it &s;eems a little City of Pallaces, guarded by a great number of Turrets, or Towers; and particularly in the King's Apartment is to be &s;een nothing but gilded Cielings, Pillars inlaid with Ivory and co&s;tly Stone;
<PB N="154" REF="85"> his Throne is exceeding Rich and Magnificent, va|lued at many Millions, by rea&s;on of rich Stones and Gold that adorn it: There are al&s;o &s;ome Temples erected within this enclo&s;ure, and &s;o many other things, that it would require a Volume to de&s;cribe them particularly.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Temples in the Pallace, the King has 7 others, in which he Sacrifices once a Year, <HI>viz.</HI> 5 in the New, and 2 in the Old City, very large, and exceedingly beautified with Gold, and co&s;tly Paintings. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e called <HI>Tien-Tam,</HI> or the Temple of Heaven, he Sacrifices to Heaven at the time the Sun comes to the Winter Sol&s;tice, Of|fering Hogs, Oxen, Goats, and Sheep, which is done with great Solemnity and Humility, the King laying a&s;ide his Golden Robe, yellow Ve&s;ture, and precious Jewels, and putting on a plain Habit of Black, or Sky-coloured Damask. The &s;econd Temple is called <HI>Ti-Tam,</HI> or the Temple of the Earth, and here the King before he is Crowned, Sa|crifices to the God of the Earth, and then putting him&s;elf into the Habit of a Ploughman, he Ploughs a little piece of Ground with a varni&s;hed Plough, drawn by 2 Oxen with gilded Horns, and in the mean time the Queen and her Ladies dre&s;s him a homely Dinner, which they Eat together. To the North of the&s;e &s;tands another Temple, called <HI>Pe Ti|en-Tam,</HI> or the North Temple of Heaven, he Sacri|fices at the time of the Summer Sol&s;tice, and at Vernal Equinox he Sacrifices in a Temple to the Ea&s;t, called <HI>Ge-Tam,</HI> or the Temple of the Sun, and at the Autumnal Equinox, at the We&s;tern Tem|ple, called <HI>Yue Tam,</HI> or the Temple of the Moon; and to prepare for the Sacrifices, there is a Fa&s;t held in <HI>Pekim</HI> for 3 days, during which time, no Fle&s;h nor Fi&s;h is to be eaten, under great Penalties; and this they &s;ay they do in a thankfulne&s;s for the Bene|fits they receive from the Earth, by the Sea&s;ons of the Year, and the influence of Heaven.</P>
<P>In the &s;ixth Temple called <HI>Ti vam miao,</HI> or the Temple of the pa&s;t Kings, is a rich Throne, and
<PB N="155" REF="85"> the Statues of all the Kings of <HI>China,</HI> from the fir&s;t King, named <HI>To hi to Xum Chi,</HI> Father to the pre&s;ent Prince; here the King performs an Annual Ceremony to his Predece&s;&s;ors. The &s;eventh Temple is called <HI>Chim-Hoam Miao,</HI> or the Temple of the Spirit that guards the Walls; but here the King never Sacri|fices, but appoints Mandarins, and other Nobles, to do it at his Charge, &s;o that the Ceremony is per|formed with much Royalty; and in every City there is &s;uch a Temple Dedicated to the &s;ame end.</P>
<P>Having proceeded thus far, I &s;hall entertain you with an account of his Pomp, and Magnificent At|tendance, when he goes out of his palace; and this he rarely does but upon two occa&s;ions, <HI>viz.</HI> either to Hunt, and take the Air, or to Sacrifice, unle&s;s nece&s;&s;ity forces him to the Wars; upon the&s;e occa|&s;ions he takes a Guard, and all the Nobles that are near have notice, and attend him in their be&s;t Equi|page; they mo&s;t con&s;i&s;t of between 12 and 13000, adorned with Embroideries of Gold, Silver, and precious Stones, their Hor&s;es traped with the &s;ame, and all their Servants that attend, at a di&s;tance, in very rich Attire.</P>

The number of tho&s;e that are appointed to carry Provi&s;ions to the Court are near 1000; tho&s;e that are to attend the Mandarins are very numerous, and the re&s;t, with|out great difficulty are not to be numbered, for all the Lakes, Rivers, and Ports are &s;o full of Ve&s;&s;els, that they &s;eem &s;o many floating Towns, or Cities, and no le&s;s than 4 Millions of People are imploy|ed in their Navigation. Their Rivers are many, and exceeding large, &s;o that on the River <HI>Kiam,</HI> which is called the Son of the Sea, one may Sail for 3 Months. The Ve&s;&s;els that are only to bring the King's Habits, Silks, Stuffs, <HI>&amp;c</HI> are 365, for eve|ry day he has a Change of rich Garments. What &s;hall I &s;ay? The People adore him as a God, and think all the valuable things on Earth too little for him, and therefore it would be endle&s;s to de&s;cribe all the Magnificence that attends his State, and eve|ry thing he is &s;erved withal. Let it &s;uffice then, that no Prince on Earth that ever I &s;aw, or heard of, equals him in Grandeur, for his Subjects look on him as the Son of Heaven, and that it is not only their Duty, but a main incumbent of Religion to Honour him in all they can. They bring their Timber, mo&s;tly by the Rivers, not in Ve&s;&s;els, but in Floats, &s;ome of 3 Leagues length, fa&s;tened to|gether with Ru&s;hes and O&s;iers, and on the Floats are little Wooden Hou&s;es for tho&s;e that guide them to lodge in by turns, and dre&s;s their Provi&s;ions: And indeed they bring plenty of all things by their Rivers and Lakes, which &s;tores their Cities and Towns very plentifully, which are very numerous, for according to their own Printed Account, of tho&s;e walled in are 4402, which are divided into two Orders, Civil and Military; the fir&s;t of the&s;e comprehend 2045, of which 175 are Cities of the fir&s;t Rank, which the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> call <HI>Tin;</HI> 274 of the &s;econd Rank, which they call <HI>Cheu;</HI> 288 which they call <HI>Hien;</HI> 205 Royal Ho&s;teries, or places of Entertainment of the fir&s;t, and 103 of the &s;econd
<PB N="158" REF="87"> Rank; and the&s;e are Govern'd by Mandarins, who, in their Governments are a kind of Viceroys.</P>
<P>The Nobility of this Kingdom, as generally ta|ken, is no more than an illu&s;trious Grandeur that has continued for &s;everal Ages, but the&s;e are &s;ubject to many ca&s;ualties, for when the Reigning Family expires, they are generally put to Death, becau&s;e they are very powerful in the Country, and give a jealous &s;u&s;pition, &s;o that new up&s;tarts are put in their Room, which renders tho&s;e more &s;afe who ac|quire this Honour, by the Gown or Military Em|ployments, becau&s;e that Honour is recalled at plea|&s;ure, and the Grand Child &s;eldom enjoys that, or their E&s;tate. There is but one of the Ancient Fa|miles now remaining that I could here of, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the Famous <HI>Confucius,</HI> who was Born under the third Imperial Family, called <HI>Cheu,</HI> 551 Years be|fore the Birth of Chri&s;t; and this Family has great Priviledges above others, as to be exempted from Taxes and Tribute in the Provinces they Inhabit. They give a Title of Honour of a lower Degree to their learned Men: and Philo&s;ophers are in great Veneration among&s;t them, and to &s;ome of them they have given the Epethite of Saint, and give the &s;ame Veneration to their Memory as to their Pagods, though they take it as an affront to be taxed with it, for they call them Kings without Command, by which imploy they were worthy of Crowns for their Learning, Virtue; and Wi&s;dom, but de&s;teny prevented them. <HI>Confucius,</HI> a Learned Man among the <HI>Chine&s;es,</HI> who, though long &s;ince Dead, is ad|mired and adored among&s;t them: He modeled their Law, or Rule, to be ob&s;erved, into nine Maxims, which he called <HI>Chum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">yum,</HI> or the Golden Medio|crity, wherein he lays down, that a good Prince ought to have 9 Qualities, or Virtues. 1. To Go|vern him&s;elf well that he may &s;how a good Exam|ple to tho&s;e he Rules over. 2.

<PB N="159" REF="87"> 3. To Love and highly re&s;pect his Kindred, the Princes of the Blood, and to grant them the Fa|vours and Rewards they merit. 4. To be Courte|ous and Re&s;pectful to the Nobility in general, and give them their due de&s;erts. To incorporate him|&s;elf in a Friendly and Amicable manner with all his Subjects, to equalize his Heart with theirs, and to regard and e&s;teem them as his own proper &s;ub&s;tance and Per&s;on. 6. To Love his People with a true Affection, unmixed with Di&s;timulation; to rejoyce at their Pro&s;perity, and be afflicted at their Mi&s;|fortunes. 7.

And the&s;e Rules well practi&s;ed may &s;erve other Kings, to render them great and happy.</P>
<P>The King has a Privy, or Supream Council of the Learned Mandarins in his Pallace, who are cal|led his Council of State, which is the mo&s;t Honou|rable Dignity in the Kingdom; the&s;e con&s;ult and tran&s;act all the weighty Affairs, and the&s;e have &s;e|veral Magnificent Halls in the Pallace, wherein they meet, to con&s;ult according to their Degrees; and when he advances any one to this Dignity, he adds to his Name, the Name of one of the&s;e Halls. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are 11 other Tribunals of Man|darins, 6 for Eccle&s;ia&s;tical and Civil, and 5 for Military Affairs: The fir&s;t of the&s;e are called <HI>Lo-pu,</HI> and the la&s;t <HI>&V;-fu,</HI> and the&s;e are of ancient In&s;tituti|on, the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> dating it 2000 Years before the Birth of Chri&s;t; and to the&s;e Tribunals People re|pair for the determining their Affairs, and for Re|dre&s;s; be&s;ides, they di&s;po&s;e of Offices and Tru&s;ts, and confirm Honour and Dignities. Their Power is great, for they have a juri&s;diction almo&s;t over all that belongs to the Court, and it is ab&s;olute over all
<PB N="160" REF="88"> the Provinces, &s;o that they are much feared, and dreaded, becau&s;e they can place and di&s;place at plea&s;ure, and examine into all Frauds and Abu&s;es to the Crown, and into Eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters. They are fearful of doing any inju&s;tice, by rea&s;on there is a Mandarin, in the nature of a Controller, or O|ver&s;eer to every Tribunal, who examins publickly or privately all that is done, and if he finds any in|ju&s;tice or di&s;order, he is bound to make the King ac|quainted with it; he is called <HI>Coli,</HI> &s;o that &s;eldom any Corruptne&s;s or Partiality is found among&s;t them, and if it be, the Offender is &s;everely puni&s;hed.

<P>There are in this Kingdom 32 Princes, or petty King's Pallaces, re&s;embling that of the King's, but much le&s;s. The Cities are Govern'd by Mandarins, as I before hinted; and when any one gets the King's Letter to the Tribunal to be admitted, the Names of the Cities are Written on thin Boards which are ca&s;t into a Ve&s;&s;el, and on their Knees they draw, and he who&s;e Name comes up is allotted the Go|vernment of that City; yet there is jugling in this, for the Tables are &s;o, where Money is given, that they &s;eldom fail of a rich City, though it is but for a &s;et time, <HI>viz.</HI> 3 Years, lea&s;t they &s;hould corrupt Ju&s;tice, or gain on the Affection of the People to rai&s;e Rebellion; however, they are Reverenc'd like petty Kings, and abundance of Royal Ho&s;teries are built in Cities, and on the Roads, to entertain them in their Travels, at the King's Charge, where every thing is in a Magnificent readine&s;s, when they know there is a Mandarin on the Road: There is al&s;o places for the Entertainment of the Curriers, and to furni&s;h them with fre&s;h Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The Mountains yield Gold and Silver, and there|fore the Country is &s;tored with Trea&s;ure, though Gold indeed is more a Merchandize than a Coin a|mong&s;t them; the pre&s;ents therefore that they make are exce&s;&s;ive, as 10, 20, or 30000 Crowns at a time. The King eats in Gold Plate, and all his Nobles, and tho&s;e that are invited, at a va&s;t number of Tables in Silver and Porcelain, &s;o that the Fur|niture

Their Ex|change is made in Bank, or places appointed for that end; on one &s;ide this Money is the Name of the Reigning Prince, and on the other that of the Tri|bunal that cau&s;ed it to be Coined. Their Gold and Silver is not properly to be called a Coin, as being only ca&s;t into Ingots like Boats of different weights and value; &s;ome of tho&s;e of Gold are vallued at 20 Crowns, and tho&s;e of Silver at half a Crown, and &s;ome more.</P>
<P>When they bury their Dead they burn a great ma|ny gilded Ingots, which they call Loans of Gold and Silver, vainly fancying the A&s;hes turns to Cop|per in the other World, and &s;erves their Friends to purcha&s;e Hou&s;es, Hor&s;es, and Provi&s;ion, likewi&s;e to bribe the evil Spirits that they &s;hould not injure them, and that &s;o the good Spirits may be Fee'd, to ha&s;ten their Tran&s;migration, &s;uffering their Souls to enter into Men, and not into Bea&s;ts.</P>

Their Firing is a kind of a Stone-coal dug in the Mountains, and &s;ometimes in the Plains, except in Woody Countries, and they are at great charge in Carriage: It gives as violent a heat as Charcoal, and the heat is very la&s;ting. They &s;leep on Mats, or Carpets, and in the Day-time &s;it together in clu&s;ters on them, the better to pre&s;erve the Heat, for the Colds are &s;ometimes very Exce&s;|&s;ive; the richer &s;ort have Beds, and the Stoves are under the floors of their Rooms, which &s;ometimes by rea&s;on of the exce&s;&s;ive Heat take Fire, burning the Hou&s;e, and &s;urprizing in the &s;uddain Flames, all that are &s;leeping in it.</P>

The learned Men affect a grave Ge&s;ture, and count it a &s;in to appear in any thing contrary to the Rules of decent Behaviour and Urbanity.</P>
<P>The Women affect Mode&s;ty, Cha&s;tity and Ho|ne&s;ty, keeping them&s;elves covered, &s;o that when they pre&s;ent any thing to their neare&s;t Relations, they lay it down, their Hands being covered with their Sleaves, and retire with Silence: They rarely &s;tir abroad, and are exceeding Submi&s;&s;ive and Obe|dient towards their Husbands, there being nothing,

<P>Upon their Fe&s;tival Days, they have a great num|ber of Illuminations, and Fire-works, repre&s;enting divers Creatures and Figures in the Air; &s;o that on a Hill at a di&s;tance, one would think all the Cities were on Fire.

<P>HAving vi&s;ited <HI>China,</HI> and learned what I thought convenient, for it is not good to be too Inqui&s;itive, for fear of being taken as a Spy. I began to be weary of the Fatigue, and of &s;o long an ab&s;ence from my Native Country, wherefore I re|&s;olved to take the fir&s;t opportunity to return home, and it was not long e're Fortune befriended me to pa&s;s by Land; (for the way by the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea is ve|ry dangerous, for that little Sea, or rather great Lake, is full of Flats and Shallows, very tempe&s;te|ous in mo&s;t Sea&s;ons, and has a great number of Rocks
<PB N="169" REF="92"> in it, with dangerous Eddies, or Whirl-pools, by rea&s;on about 100 large Rivers di&s;charge them&s;elves violently into it;) for there was a Caravan going from <HI>Pekim</HI> to <HI>Bokara,</HI> and in it I entered my &s;elf with all Nece&s;&s;aries for my Journey, and in 15 days the Weather being very fair, and our Stages large, we reached <HI>Soezi,</HI> the la&s;t Town of <HI>China,</HI> with|out the great Wall; and here I &s;tored my &s;elf with abundance of good Ruburb that grows in their Gardens, which &s;tood me in much &s;tead when I came into the cold Countries; and from hence we journeyed mo&s;tly <HI>North-we&s;t,</HI> and the principal Towns in our way, was <HI>Baretola, Kechemire, Kibo|al, Samark,</HI> and &s;ome others, which by rea&s;on of my Indi&s;po&s;ition on the Road, I &s;hall not undertake to de&s;cribe.

On the tops of the high Mountains, though in the begin|ning of Summer, the People are Rude and Simple, mo&s;t of them living by feeding Cattle, which they drive from one place to another, carrying their Wives, Children, and all they have along with them; pitching Tents in their Encampments, e&s;pe|cially where they find plea&s;ant Springs, and &s;tay there till the Gra&s;s is Eat up, and then they re|move: The <HI>Tartars</HI> are a very numerous People, and &s;pread a va&s;t track of Land in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> and Principally they are thus divided, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Precopen&s;es, A&s;ialica, Antiqua</HI> and <HI>Cathur</HI> from their Principal Provinces, which may be termed, though there are other numerous little Divi&s;ions too many here to mention; and though they are a cruel kind of People, our Caravan met with no on-&s;et by the way, though we &s;ee numerous Hoards of them on either hand. As we &s;ee their Hou&s;es are mean and incon&s;iderable, and their Diet mo&s;tly raw Fle&s;h in many places, and above all, they are great lovers of the Fat of Bears, yet they give not their Minds
<PB N="170" REF="93"> &s;o much to Robberies as the <HI>Arabs,</HI> or other untra|ctable Nations, becau&s;e few of them know the u&s;e of it, or at lea&s;t have no great e&s;teem for Money; &s;ome are <HI>Idolars,</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Mahometans.</HI></P>
<P>This Track abounds in Furs, and there are &s;ome Mines of Gold and Silver found in many parts, but they little regard Diging it; and &s;o barbarous are they, that many of them dre&s;s their Children at great Fea&s;ts, to entertain their Gue&s;s, as the choice&s;t of Dainties; nor do they refrain from Fea&s;tings on their Dead: There are a great many &s;trong Stags and Harts I &s;aw in my Pa&s;&s;age, which they u&s;e to Ride, carry Burthens, and draw their Waggons, or Sledges. Mulbury-Trees grow in &s;ome places a|long the Roads, e&s;pecially bordering on <HI>China,</HI> which are laden in their proper Sea&s;ons with Silk|worms that produce much Silk, but they little re|gard it, it being mo&s;tly gathered by the <HI>Banians,</HI> who live &s;cattered among them, who &s;end it to <HI>Per|&s;ia</HI> and other Countries, and have rich Merchandize in return; for here the coldne&s;s of the Country obliges them mo&s;tly to habit them&s;elves in Furs, and thick cour&s;e Cloathings. They trade much in White and Black Fox Sables, Hart and Fawn Skins; they have va&s;t Forre&s;ts of Black Wood, wherein many huge Bears lurk to &s;urprize Travellers, which made us keep clo&s;e together when we pa&s;&s;ed &s;uch places, and have our Eyes about us, as well as our Fire-arms in readine&s;s; and &s;o keeping the Road, though not without many turnings, and ruged ways, when we had pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Samark,</HI> and it brought us to <HI>Bockar,</HI> where I &s;taid &s;ome time to refre&s;h me, for I had been ill of a Flux by the way, which &s;till held me &s;o, that I took no great plea&s;ure to make any cu|rious remarks here, and had I done it, as I was in|formed, there is nothing worthy of Note in the Town, the Hou&s;es being plain and low Built, the Streets crooked, and no Antiquities memorable. Here the <HI>Mo&s;covites</HI> and <HI>Yousbecs Tartar</HI> are driving a con&s;iderable Trade together in Furs, and other Commodities.</P>
<PB N="171" REF="93">
<P> Having here pretty well recovered, by the a&s;&s;i|&s;tance of a <HI>German</HI> Phy&s;ician, I found in this place, I thought, a convenient opportunity to pa&s;s to <HI>A&s;tra|kan,</HI> which in a few days, I had, pa&s;&s;ing part of the way in Sledges, drawn by Harts, that run with them very &s;wiftly; and an other part, by taking Hor&s;e, there being a kind of a little Caravan, made up by the meeting of divers Travellers. The <HI>Mu&s;|covites</HI> u&s;e Sledges, that in the Winter they &s;lide &s;wiftly over the Snow and Frozen Rivers, having Beds in them, and covered over with Tilts like Waggons, &s;o that they are a warm Convenience; notwith&s;tanding in Winter, Travellers have been Frozen to Death in them.</P>
<P><HI>A&s;trakan</HI> is Seated on the Great and Famous Ri|ver <HI>Volga,</HI> which at 70 Mouths, or Channels, di&s;|charges its Water into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, and &s;o forcibly, that it keeps it &s;tream unmixed with the Salt-water for many Leagues. In this River, the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> have a great Fi&s;hery for Sturgeon, which they catch in abundance very large, &s;o that the Eggs &s;ometimes found in one of them, may weigh 100 Weight: As for the Fle&s;h, they pickle up and &s;end it into di|vers parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;ome they pre&s;s to make Oyl, and the Eggs they &s;alt to make Ragous to &s;erve them in&s;tead of Butter, which in <HI>Lent</HI> is denied them, and this is the Cavere &s;o much u&s;ed in many Countries.

<P>We were forced to &s;tay before this City, till we obtained leave of the Governor for admittance; which after a little attendance, was granted: It is Seated in 48 Degrees <HI>North</HI> Latitude, in an I&s;land of the <HI>Volga,</HI> 13 Leagues from the Mouth of the River, and appartains to the Great <HI>Czar</HI> of <HI>Mu&s;covy.</HI> It is encompa&s;&s;ed with a double Wall, without any o|ther Fortification, except &s;ome few Towers, half Musket Shot one from an other.

There are divers &s;orts of Grapes, of which they make a kind of plea&s;ant Wine, but it &s;oon Sowers: All this while, no private Per&s;on dares touch a Grape till the Governour has made choice of them, and other Fruits, for the <HI>Czar's</HI> Table. There are divers Nations inhabiting here, drawn by the Convenieney of Trade, and the &s;weetne&s;s of the Air. The <HI>Armenians</HI> entirely po&s;&s;e&s;s one Suburb, and the <HI>Nogais Tartars</HI> an other, which re&s;emble a City, being Fortified with Wooden Ramports, and the Deputy Governour Commands there; within the Enclo&s;ure &s;tands a pretty convenient Mo&s;que, but the Hou&s;es for the mo&s;t part are made of Bull|ru&s;hes, of which there are about 2000. They keep a Market in the Morning in their Quarter, and the <HI>Ma&s;covites</HI> keep theirs in the Evening, in the middle of their City; yet this City is often in&s;ulted by the <HI>Calmuc Tartars,</HI> which con&s;trains the Inhabi|tants for their better Repo&s;e, to &s;end them Pre&s;ents, which the <HI>Tartars</HI> call a Tribute of Bread, Fi&s;h, Fle&s;h, and other Provi&s;ions, and they drive a Trade with them for Furs and Hor&s;es, of which they bring great plenty; be&s;ides the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> are many times obliged to them, for their a&s;&s;i&s;ting them with Men in the time of their Wars.</P>

<P>HAving a de&s;ire to &s;ee <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and particularly <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> the chief City, I made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to find an opportunity to leave <HI>A&s;trakan,</HI> and pa&s;s thither.</P>
<P>As for this va&s;t Country, it is bounded on the <HI>We&s;t</HI> with <HI>Lithuania</HI> and <HI>Livonia;</HI> on the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> with <HI>Tar|tary;</HI> on the <HI>North,</HI> with the Frozen Ocean; on the <HI>South,</HI> with the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Empire, and <HI>Paulus Maeotis.</HI> It is branched with many large Navigable Rivers, as the <HI>Tanais, Borhi&s;tenes, Volga,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>Towards the <HI>Southern</HI> parts, it is pretty plentiful of many things of Value, yielding Corn, Cattle, Furs, Flax, Hemp, Wax, Honey, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but the <HI>Northern</HI> parts lye very cold, the Earth being &s;o long covered with Snow, that the Ground is chilled, and produces not its Fruits kindly; yet Furs are gotten off of White, Black and Red Foxes, Grey and Red Squrrils, Minever Ermins, Wolverin, or wild Dogs. The Woods which are generally Fur
<PB N="174" REF="95"> and Birch, abound in Ravenous Creatures, parti|cularly, Wolves and Bears, which in the extremity of Weather, pinched by Cold and Hunger, comes in great Clu&s;ters to the Villages near the Forre&s;t, and puts the Inhabitants to flight many times, kill|ing and devouring them and their Cattle, &s;o that at &s;uch times, by way of prevention, they are forced to be on their Guard.

The Building is not Stately, yet very Commodious, for the Inhabitants, who are a mixed People, as they are
<PB N="175" REF="95"> on all the Borders; we lodged and refre&s;hed our &s;elves here, and pa&s;&s;ed in a 11 days through a fine Country, well Watered, and very Fruitful, to a con|&s;iderable fair Town, which we reached in 10 days, called <HI>Ni&s;novogrod,</HI> where <HI>Occa</HI> falls into the <HI>Volga.</HI> This is the head of a Shire, or County of that Name, and from hence by <HI>Rezan,</HI> and &s;o pa&s;&s;ing a tedious Journey through many difficult ways, we came to the River <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> on who&s;e Banks the City of <HI>Mo&s;|cow</HI> &s;tands. I &s;hould have told you I left my Merchant Trading up the River <HI>Camaon,</HI> on who&s;e Banks are &s;everal and pretty Towns, but he took care to provide me a Guide, who accompanied me to <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> the neare&s;t way over the Land, and to help me to Imbark where the Rivers offered to le&s;&s;en our Journey, for I did not think fit to fall directly down the <HI>Volga</HI> into the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea, which would little have furthered me.</P>
<P>Being arrived at the head City of <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> I en|tered on the River &s;ide, and finding &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> there, I was not long de&s;titute of a Habitation, and being Evening when I entered, I thought fit to re&s;t that Night, and the next day went to take a view of the City, which is very large. The Form of it is in a manner round, with three &s;trong Walls, cir|cling the one within the other, the Streets lying pretty commodiou&s;ly within all the Heart or Cen|ter inclo&s;ed by the inmo&s;t Wall, is called the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Ca&s;tle, or Pallace, very large in Circle; the Hou&s;es of ordinary Per&s;ons are but indifferently built with Timber, Loam and Mortar, covered with Boards or Bark of Trees; but the Hou&s;es of the Nobles are pretty Sately. The Churches are many, and they are Adorned on the tops with Globes of Copper, and guilded Spires. That of <HI>Blane&s;hina</HI> or <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s,</HI> is of curious Architecture, after the Fa&s;hion of the <HI>Greek</HI> Churches, who&s;e Tenents in Religion, the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> devoutly hold; the Church of St. <HI>Michael</HI> is nothing inferiour to it, but above all, the Cathe|dral called, <HI>Our Ladies Church,</HI> is large and &s;tately; in it the Czars are Crowned by the Patriarch. The

The Diet is choice, and well dre&s;&s;ed, according to the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Fa&s;hion; their Drink is Wine, Meath, and &s;ometimes &s;trong <HI>Aquavitae,</HI> which among them is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">alled <HI>Ru&s;s</HI> Wine.</P>
<P>In this City are &s;till to be &s;een &s;ome Ruins of the Walls the &s;everal Fires have made, for I was told it contained 41500 Hou&s;es before the <HI>Crim Tartars</HI> re|duced it to A&s;hes, <HI>Anno</HI> 1571. and in it de&s;troyed 80000 People, and be&s;ides the Hou&s;es, 1500 con|vent Churches and Chapples.

There is one thing Admirable, which is a Bell rai&s;ed in a large Tower; this Bell is 24 foot in height, and I was told, though it has been chipped off &s;ome Tuns of Mettle to make it ring better, that it weighs 176 Tun, and the Clap|per 4 Tun, which is pulled by a Rope to &s;ound it on particular occa&s;ions, for it cannot be rai&s;ed by rea&s;on of its va&s;t weight.</P>

<P>The Women are much confined at Home, and very Obliging and Obedient to their Husbands, yet &s;o much Heat as they endure, being clo&s;ed up in Winter, tending their Fires, makes them but of a bad Complexion, yet they mend their Faces by their Husbands allowance, with a Red and White Paint, but ea&s;ily di&s;cernable; yet being the Fa&s;hion, is not minded, and e&s;pecially, among the Vulgar: If

<P>The next chief City of <HI>Mo&s;covy</HI> is <HI>Novogrod,</HI> plea&s;antly Seated, and a place of con&s;iderable Trade; the Building mo&s;tly of Wood, as generally the Buil|ding is in all this Country, the Streets in many places not paved, but planked with Furr, jointed and laid in &s;o, that it &s;hoots the Water off commodi|ou&s;ly; it is the head of a Province or Shire, where the Court of Ju&s;tice do determine matters, is held by a Duke and Dyack, the Latter acting in the na|ture of a Secretary; and the&s;e Courts are held in all chief Cities, but an Appeal lays from them to the Office of the four Chetfrids at <HI>Mo&s;cow,</HI> who are chief Judges of the four Quarters, or Divi&s;ions of the whole Country of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> each holding an Office for his Di&s;trict or Quarter, and all the Shires or Provinces apply them&s;elves to the Office of that Lord of the Chetfrid they are under, then the mat|ter is laid before the <HI>Czar</HI>'s Council, and what they Determine, is &s;ent back to be put in Execution.</P>
<P><HI>Vologda</HI> is an other principal City, &s;eated on a Ri|ver of that Name, where is a great Trade for Furs, Hides, Tallow, Corn and other Merchandize, bringing in a con&s;iderable Revenue in Cu&s;toms and other Taxes to the Prince, who has a part in this an other places, for almo&s;t every thing that is &s;old, &s;o that his Incoms are very great, accounted no le&s;s than 13 Millions of Rubbles a Year, and a Rubble is reckoned according to Exchange, a Mark <HI>Eng|li&s;h.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Ro&s;tove</HI> may be numbered among the re&s;t; for here is a great Trade for Furs, and other Commo|dities, bought up to di&s;per&s;e into other parts of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> and Merchants come hither as far as <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> &s;ome &s;ay from <HI>China,</HI> beyond the great Wall built to exclude the roving <HI>Tartars,</HI> of which I have al|ready &s;poke of.

<P>BEing at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> I began &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider of my Travels, and whil&s;t I Ruminated on many things, a &s;trange fancy came into my Head, that I had not compleated my fir&s;t undertaking, in vi&s;iting the &s;everal Parts of the World, becau&s;e I had not been in <HI>America;</HI> though the fatigues and dangers I had run thro' might have been a &s;ufficient Motive to have put a &s;top to my further Progre&s;s in &s;trange Countries, and give me &s;atisfaction enough to have returned home; but the report of the Golden Mountains, and other things, egged me on, made me &s;eek for an opportunity to pa&s;s to <HI>Cales,</HI> where I doubted not but by one means or other, to get a Pa&s;&s;age into the <HI>Spani&s;h Indies,</HI> for that was it I Aimed at; for the other I under&s;tood are little con&s;iderable, as to Travellers, and have nothing Extraordinary to be found in them, and be&s;ides are mo&s;tly very well known to my Countrymen: therefore in de&s;cribing <HI>New-England, Virginia, Bar|badoes, Jamaica,</HI> &amp;c. I &s;hould have furni&s;hed their Curio&s;ity with nothing that is rare, and new to them. I had not waited a Week before an op|portunity offered, and I Embarked with &s;uch ne|ce&s;&s;aries, as I had procured. Entering the Bay of <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> we were taken with a violent Storm, and &s;prung our Mizen; it held us for 24 Hours, &s;o that every moment we thought we &s;hould become a prey to <HI>Neptune</HI>'s Watery fry, and this Storm
<PB N="189" REF="102"> was more terrible, and threatned more danger than any I had &s;een before, which made me repent my attempting &s;o ra&s;hly, as thinking God was angry with me for my pre&s;umption, and then concluded if I could get &s;afe a&s;hoar I would re&s;t quiet, with what I had &s;een and felt; the Storm at la&s;t blew over, and then a fre&s;h gale, Providence &s;o ordered it, that we reached the de&s;ired Port.</P>
<P>Being now on Land again at <HI>Cales,</HI> or <HI>Cadiz,</HI> in the Dominion of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;uch is man's frailty, I found my de&s;ire of Travelling not &s;o much quenched, as in the Tempe&s;t I fancied it. A &s;ecret Inclination promi&s;ed, and urged me on, that &s;eeing I had made &s;o many weary &s;teps in 3 parts of the World, I &s;hould now venture upon the propo&s;ed fourth, held to be Larger and Richer than any of the other three, and as fortune would throw it in my way, to make me more re&s;olved on it, a <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Merchant whom I had been Intimately Ac|quainted withal in <HI>London,</HI> I renewed my Acquain|tance with him, and he Entertained me very ci|villy, but when I opened my Mind, and unbo&s;omed my Intentions, he told me it would be a very dif|ficult undertaking, becau&s;e the Officers of the Port had very &s;trict Orders not to permit Strangers to Embarque for the <HI>Spani&s;h Indies,</HI> lea&s;t they might be &s;ent thither as Spies to di&s;cover the Havens, and Strength of the Forts, and other things that might be prejudicial to the Government. I told him I had no &s;uch Intention, that curio&s;ity was only to inform my &s;elf, as a Travellor, of what was rare to be ob&s;erved in a World, which the alwi&s;e God had &s;o Admirally framed and ordered, and when I gave him a general account in what Parts I had been, and &s;howed him my Papers of Memo|randums, and curious Remarks, he was &s;atisfied, promi&s;ed to do his Endeavour for the furtherance and &s;ecurity of my pa&s;&s;age, and to furni&s;h me with Money &s;utable to the Country, upon Bills I gave him to receive by Exchange in <HI>London;</HI> and then he let me know he was a Part-owner in one of the

I had pretty well learned the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> which with little more attention I doubled, not to Improve &s;o well in my Voyage as to be taken for a <HI>Spaniard</HI> among the Native <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>America,</HI> who, I was In|formed, but corruptly &s;poke the Language of old <HI>Spain.</HI> In a little time a warning Piece was fired for the Fleet to weigh Anchor, and tho' our Ship was narrowly &s;earched, I &s;o well wraped my &s;elf up in a Ticking, and lay in&s;tead of a Bol&s;ter at the Bed&s;head, that I was not di&s;covered, tho' they tur|ned up the Quilt, and other covering to &s;ee if a|ny had ab&s;conded under them, that were not Li|cen&s;ed to depart.</P>
<P>Anchors weighed, and the Wind being fair, we &s;et Sail with a pro&s;perous Gale till we came to <HI>Colfo d' Yeguas,</HI> a very turbulent Sea, where the Ships and Galeons rowled and tottered extreamly, the Waves da&s;hing violently, by rea&s;on of an Eddy oc|ca&s;ion by a current that &s;et into it, and the Gal|leon who went only a Convoy, having convey'd us thus, left us as concluding we were out of dan|ger; e&s;pecially of the <HI>Barbary</HI> Cori&s;aries, and then by the Ma&s;ters advice I &s;howed my &s;elf on the Decks, as not fearing to be carried back again, or hinder|ed in my further pa&s;&s;age; and having the Wind con&s;tantly favourable, we &s;teered our cour&s;e without meeting with any thing Remarkable, till we made the Land of <HI>America,</HI> about 6 Weeks after we &s;et out from <HI>Cales.</HI> Here I &s;aw many Dorados, or Gol|den Fi&s;h, &s;porting in the Water, &s;o called, becau&s;e their Skins are of the Colour of Gold, and the Sailers with Hooks and Lines catched a great ma|ny of them: they Eat &s;omething like a Herring, but more &s;hort and Sweet.

Yet for all this kindne&s;s, we could not but &s;u&s;pect they Murthered two of our men, who went into the Woods to gather wild Fruit, for tho' we &s;earched and &s;tayed for them, they returned not, nor could be found, which made the re&s;t more cautious to venture too far.</P>

<P>THE proper name of this Sea-port Towns is St. <HI>John d' &V;lha,</HI> the other <HI>Vera Crux,</HI> be|ing given to it from the old Haven or Harbour of <HI>Vera Crux,</HI> lying 6 Leagues from it; for that proving dangerous for Ships to ride at Anchor in, by rea&s;on of the violent North Winds, it was for&s;aken, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> removed hither, as be|ing more &s;afe by the means of a Rock which skreens off that Wind: and here were the fir&s;t Maje&s;trates, Judges, Aldermen and Officers of Ju|&s;tice named. Great was the Concour&s;e of the People when we landed, and the Religious, who have Mona&s;teries here, received us in proce&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e they under&s;tood there were &s;ome Mi&s;&s;i|onaries on board, &s;ent out of <HI>Spain</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t in converting the <HI>Indians,</HI> and upon the Account of &s;ome of them, who took particular notice of me, during the Voyage. I had a very good Lodg|ing appointed me, and great Fea&s;ting was made with &s;tore of Fowl and Fi&s;h, of which the Coun|try
<PB N="194" REF="105"> is very plentiful, and as a la&s;t Cour&s;e Sweet meats and Chocolett were brought in; <HI>Te Deum</HI> was &s;ung in the Cathedral Church, and &s;ome Shows pre&s;ented, but my mind being bent an other way, I little minded the&s;e things.</P>
<P>I re&s;ted the day of Landing with my Compa|nions, and the next took a &s;urvey of the Town, and places about it; I compa&s;&s;ed it in 3 quar|ters of an hour, and found the Scituation to be on Sandy ground, except on the South We&s;t, where it is Moori&s;h, and full of noi&s;ome Bogs at a little di&s;tance, which in hot weather cau&s;es it to be &s;omewhat unhealthy: the People in it are ge|nerally Rich, and the Inhabitants may, as near as I could compute, be between 3 or 4000. The Hou&s;es, Churches and Cloi&s;ters are mo&s;tly built with Timber, the Streets are few, yet have inter|cour&s;e by narrow Lanes, or other pa&s;&s;ages; &s;o that it has been often much Indamaged by Fire: The Trade is con&s;iderable there from <HI>Mexico,</HI> as being the conveniente&s;t part al&s;o from <HI>Cuba</HI> St. <HI>Domingo, Jucatan, Portoello,</HI> and by the way of the latter from <HI>Peru, Cartagena,</HI> and all the I&s;lands lying on the North Sea. There is a Ca&s;tle on the Entrance, founded on a Rock, and another Rock that makes the Entrance of &s;hipping unacquainted with the Harbour very difficult each are the chiefe&s;t Strength of the Town, and under the&s;e the Ships lie &s;afe at Anchor, &s;heltred again&s;t the fury of the North Wind, which is many times there very violent, &s;o that the Hou&s;es in the Town Rock and Totter ex|ceedingly, that the Strangers conclude they are fall|ing on their Heads.</P>
<P>The next day I found a great many Mules brought by the Owners to be Lett, to &s;uch as had a mind to leave the place and Travel further. I embraced this opportunity, and &s;ent on Board to bring my Baggage on Shoar, which I Laded on one of them, and retained another to ride on; and &s;o taking leave of tho&s;e who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s or Curio&s;ity detain'd them longer, I &s;et forward to vi&s;it <HI>Mexico,</HI> a famed

<P>They Conducted us to the Market-place, which is in the middle of the Town, and made Ar|bours of green Boughs under two large &s;preading Elmes, for us to repo&s;e in and refre&s;h our &s;elves, and thither brought us plenty of Sweet-meats, Diet-bread, and Chocolet, having before placed Tables and Benches for the purpo&s;e, and the <HI>In|dians</HI> particularly A&s;&s;embled about us in great num|bers, welcoming us into the Country. This place is but of indifferent Building, and not of any con&s;iderable Trade, for want of a good Har|bour; the Buildings are of Wood; and here I ob&s;erve the Friars have a great Command over the people, for what they order them they immedi|ately do, rendring to them profound Honours and Re&s;pects Having refre&s;hed our &s;elves here, we gave the people Thanks for their Civility, and &s;o took leave, reaching a little before Night a &s;mall <HI>Indian</HI> Town, where we Lodged, and found very good Entertainment of Turkeys, Hens, Ca|pons, and Fruits.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXIII. <HI>My Arrival at</HI> Mexico; <HI>a De&s;criptien of that famed City, what it has been, and what at pre&s;ent it is; the manner of Building; nature of its Inhabitants; Ri|ches, and plenty of the Mountains, Lakes, and places about it,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AFter a tedious Journey, being Arrived at the great City of <HI>Mexico,</HI> the Head of the Nor|thern <HI>Spani&s;h Indies,</HI> I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak more particularly of it, than of other places I pa&s;&s;ed through, as to what it now is, and in ge|neral as to what it has been, in its mo&s;t flou|ri&s;hing &s;plendor.</P>
<P>This City is large in Compa&s;s, and &s;tands on two Lakes, which &s;ome have concluded to be but one, becau&s;e of their nearne&s;s and Communi|cation
<PB N="201" REF="108"> of their Waters, but they appear different in three things particularly; <HI>viz.</HI> one ebbs and flows by the force of the North-Wind, and the other does not; the Water of the one is Sweet, the other is Salt and Bracki&s;h; one has great &s;tore of Fi&s;h, and the other is de&s;titute of any, though they have both their &s;ource or Springs that feed them from the great Mountain that overlooks the City. The Hou&s;es in this City are Built more &s;tately, e&s;pe|cially tho&s;e of the Nobility and Gentry, than in other places; the Vice-Roy of the <HI>Mexacanian</HI> Province has his Palace here, and &s;o has the Arch-Bi&s;hop. The Churches are many, Founded mo&s;t|ly on the Heathen Temples, which were in the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of the City, very numerous, and had Pyramides in the Mid&s;t of a va&s;t height, on which the Idols &s;tood, to whom they offered Hu|mane Blood in Sacrifice, and &s;prinkled the Walls and Pillars of the Idol-Altar with it; there are in the City &s;everal Spacious Streets, and great Markets, affording all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions and o|ther Nece&s;&s;aries. The Lakes by rea&s;on of the a|bundance of Boats and Canoes that Trade on them, furni&s;h the City with &s;tore of plenty, e&s;pecially with multitudes of Fowl and Fi&s;h taken there, the former being allured by a certain Oily tough Scum on the Water, which they eat as Food; be&s;ides there are many Trading Towns on the Banks where the Boats take in Loading, and con|&s;tantly &s;upply the City. The Mona&s;teries and Nun|neries are a graceful Ornament to the re&s;t, their being almo&s;t of all the Orders. The Churches have Curious Spires, with Guilded Cro&s;&s;es on their Tops and the whole Fabrick's Built with Stone of rare Architecture. Water comes almo&s;t into all parts of the City, by &s;mall Conduits, for though the Streets were formerly watered by Chan|nels from the Lake, they are now mo&s;tly &s;top|ped up, and firm Ground made where Hou&s;es are Built; for after the Conque&s;t, <HI>Cortez</HI> divided the Ground where the Hou&s;es had been Con&s;umed

The <HI>Spaniards</HI> Built their Hou&s;es in their own Fa&s;hion, and the <HI>Indi|ans</HI> theirs according to the cu&s;tom of the Coun|trey. <HI>Cortez</HI> Built his where King <HI>Montezumas</HI>'s &s;tately Palace &s;tood, which in the Siege had been con&s;umed with Fire, and a va&s;t number of Wild Bea&s;ts of all &s;orts that he kept there in Wooden Cages Burnt in it, lamentably roaring and how|ling as the Fire approached them; and this Hou&s;e is the mo&s;t &s;tately in the City, being the Seat of the Vice-Roy of all the Province, and is called the Palace of the <HI>Marque&s;s d' Valla,</HI> for that Ti|tle the King of <HI>Spain</HI> conferred on <HI>Cortez,</HI> after he had obtained his amazing Victories, over &s;uch a mighty Nation, con&s;idering his Forces were but a handful of <HI>Spaniards;</HI> but that which &s;eemed in all humane probability to give him &s;ucce&s;s were the Bullets, and Chain-Shot, proceeding from his Thundring Artillery, for the <HI>Indians</HI> unacquainted with &s;uch Engines, took their roaring and brea|thing flame to be the Voice of the Angry Gods that fought again&s;t them, and when the Shot made Lanes among them, they took them for their Thunderbolts, or de&s;troying Angels, &s;ent as Me&s;&s;engers of their vengeance, to cut them off, not thinking any thing in nature could be of &s;o violent a force, as to beat down Ranks of Men before them with &s;uch &s;wiftne&s;s that the Eye could &s;carce trace the Deaths they gave.

<P>HAving thus Travelled to <HI>Mexico,</HI> and de|&s;cribed it as particularly as Pro&s;pect and Enquiry could inform me; I now undertake briefly to do the like of the Country of <HI>Ameri|cas,</HI> as far as it is yet known to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> or <HI>Indians,</HI> I conver&s;ed with tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>The chief Divi&s;ion therefore of this great part of the World is two fold, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Mexicanian,</HI> and <HI>Peruanian</HI> Provinces. <HI>Mexico</HI> gives name to the greater half of <HI>America,</HI> and is called <HI>Nova Hi&s;pa|nia,</HI> or <HI>New Spain,</HI> from whence the Kings of <HI>Spain</HI> Style them&s;elves <HI>Hi&s;aniour Reges.</HI> The <HI>Mex|ican</HI> Track containeth chiefly the Northern Parts, comprehending many large Provinces, or Coun|tries, already known, and many not yet well di&s;|covered, as the parts that lie between it to the Northern or Frozen-Sea, <HI>viz. Mexico, Quivira, Ni|caragna, Jucatan, Flerida virgina, Norumbega, Nova, Francia, Corteralis, E&s;toliland,</HI> and &s;ome others, &s;o that the Compa&s;s of this part already known is at lea&s;t 23000 Miles.</P>
<P>The <HI>Peruanan</HI> part contains all the Southern Track, tied to the <HI>Mexican</HI> by the <HI>I&s;thmus,</HI> or
<PB N="211" REF="113"> &s;treight of <HI>Darien,</HI> being between 12 and 17 Miles over in &s;ome parts, from the Northern to the Sou|thern Sea. This part contains the Provinces, or Kingdoms, of <HI>Ca&s;tella, Aurea, Gunia, Peru, Bra&s;il, Chille,</HI> in compa&s;s about 17000 Miles.</P>
<P><HI>Mexico,</HI> as I ob&s;erved, abounds with Gold &s;and|ed Rivers, producing many devouring Crocadils, tho' not &s;o big as tho&s;e in the <HI>Nile</HI> in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> which the poorer &s;ort of the <HI>Indians</HI> take and feed on their Fle&s;h, as a great dainty. There are &s;everal Moun|tains ca&s;ting fourth Flames of Fire in it, as <HI>Pepo|champeche, Popocatapec,</HI> and others, nay, all the <HI>Sou|thern</HI> parts, as far as <HI>Leon</HI> in <HI>Nicaragua</HI> produces ma|ny of them, but the latter I have named, is one of the chief; it &s;tands 8 Leagues from <HI>Chollola,</HI> it is a &s;teep rockey Mountain. Ten <HI>Spaniards</HI> attended with <HI>Indians</HI> to carry their Water and Victuals, un|dertook to take a Survey of it, and approached &s;o near the top, that they heard a terrible noi&s;e, occa|&s;ioned by the Erruption of Fire; then the ground &s;haked &s;o terribly, that they dur&s;t not approach no nearer, however, they perceived the Vulcan or Cavety whence the Fire I&s;&s;ued half a League in compa&s;s out, which Air and Fire proceeded, re|bounding with a terrible Noi&s;e, Shrill and Whi&s;t|ling, &s;o that the whole Hill trembled, and the top near this Mouth was covered with A&s;hes, about knee-deep, and as they were viewing it, &s;uch a &s;hower of Fire fell, that had they not &s;tept under the craggy over-hanging of a Rock, they had there been roa&s;ted to Death; but in an hour or two, it clearing up, they ha&s;ted down much affrighted, but without any harm: This Mountain be|fore the coming of <HI>Hernando Cartez,</HI> had for ten Years di&s;&s;i&s;ted &s;ending forth Flames, and when it began again according to a prediction among them, the <HI>Indians</HI> looked for &s;ome great mi&s;ery to befall them by change of Government. The A&s;hes blown in the Air, are many times &s;cattered 10 Leagues from the foot of the Mountain.</P>

<P> This chief Province, called <HI>Mexico,</HI> is further divided into &s;ix Parts, <HI>viz.

<P>Near <HI>Mexico,</HI> is <HI>Tacuba,</HI> a plea&s;ant Town inclo|&s;ed with Gardens; in the way to <HI>Chapultepec,</HI> is <HI>Ta|luco,</HI> a Town much traded to, and in the Woods breed Hogs, producing Bacon as good as our We&s;t|phalia.

There is a plea&s;ant Town bending to the <HI>North,</HI> called, <HI>la Soledad,</HI> or the <HI>Solitary Wilderne&s;s,</HI> where the Bare-footed <HI>Car|melite</HI> Friars have their Re&s;idence; but if this be a Wilderne&s;s, few places can be accounted plea&s;ant, for it affords Fruits, Flowers, Shades Fountains, and every thing that can delight Mankind. And heither re&s;ort the Nobles and Gentry to take their Plea&s;ure, who bring great Pre&s;ents to the Friars, &s;o that they live Fat and Plentiful on the outward appear|ance of Sanctity; for in their Oratory, and Cells made in Rocks, they hang Whips of Wyer, Gir|dles with &s;harp pricking Needles to wear next their Skin, &s;hirts of Hair, and other mortifying Materials; but one of them ingeniou&s;ly told me, they were pla|ced there more for &s;hew, than u&s;e, to move Peoples Charity towards them, and brought them a va&s;t income of Money, and all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions; and indeed though they have out of a de&s;ign given this
<PB N="213" REF="114"> place the name of a Wilderne&s;s, it &s;eemed to me an Earthly Paradi&s;e. At <HI>Tadubaya,</HI> not much di&s;tance from this place, is a very rich Cloi&s;ter of <HI>Franci&s;|cans,</HI> with curious Gardens and Orchards belonging to it; they have a &s;tately Church there, and the <HI>In|dians</HI> have been taught by the Prie&s;ts to be Choiri|&s;ters, and &s;ing very fine.</P>
<P>I have &s;poken &s;omewhat already of the Province of <HI>Gua&s;tachan,</HI> which I pa&s;&s;ed in my Travels from St. <HI>John de &V;lhua,</HI> to <HI>Mexico.</HI> It is a very plentiful Country, abounding in Sugar, farms Pa&s;ture, Corn, Cochinil, reaching as far as the Valley of <HI>Guaxaca,</HI> a very rich place, but having &s;poke of the mo&s;t ma|terial Towns in my Pa&s;&s;age, I &s;hall pa&s;s to the third Province, called <HI>Mechoacan,</HI> which is about 80 Leagues in circumference. This Province is very rich, abounding in Mulberry-trees, which feed a great number of Silk-worms; al&s;o in Wax, Honey, Black Amber, divers coloured Feathers, of which they make curious Works, and the River abound with &s;tore of Fi&s;h. The chief City of this Province is <HI>Valodolid,</HI> a Bi&s;hop's See; the Towns of Note are <HI>Sin&s;onte,</HI> which before the Conque&s;t, was the Re&s;i|dence of the <HI>Indian</HI> King of the Province <HI>Pa&s;cuar</HI> and <HI>Coliman,</HI> inhabited by <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Indians.</HI> There are al&s;o two good Havens, called St. <HI>Antho|ny</HI> and St. <HI>James,</HI> or <HI>Santiago;</HI> the King of it, call|ed <HI>Caconzin,</HI> was a great Friend to <HI>Cortez,</HI> and much a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in his Wars again&s;t the <HI>Mexicons,</HI> will|ingly yielding him&s;elf a Va&s;&s;al to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> though it was ill requited; for <HI>don Nunio de Guzman,</HI> fir&s;t Ruler and Pre&s;ident of the Chancery of <HI>Mexi|co,</HI> after the Conque&s;t picked a Quarrel, and made War on this Province, took the King Pri&s;oner, who was quiet and peaceable, not &s;tiring again&s;t him; and when he had &s;tript him out of 10000 Marks in Plate, Gold, and other Riches, he inhumanly burnt him at a Stake, with divers of his Nobles and Gentry, who &s;eemed to rejoyce that they were ac|counted worthy to &s;uffer with their King, and in Death bear him Company into the other World.</P>

The In|habitants of the&s;e parts take a greater pride in Gla&s;s Beads, and other Trifles, than in Gold and Jewels, and are ea&s;ily impo&s;ed on for the Exchange of the Hides of their Cattle; they make Coverings for their homely Cottages; of their Bones they make Bodkins and Needles; of their Hair, Thread; of their Sinue, Cordage; of their Blood, Drink; and of their Fle&s;h, Meat; of their Horns, Paunches, and Bladders, Ve&s;&s;els: Some are of Opinion, that there is a Traffick on this Coa&s;t from <HI>China,</HI> or <HI>Ca|thagina,</HI> from whence <HI>Va&s;quez de Corovado</HI> made a Progre&s;s into &s;ome parts of it, with his Army of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> which he &s;aw from the Rocks, and high Mountains, on the Sea Coa&s;t, Ships at Sea, not of common Building, &s;eeming to be well laden, and bearing in their Prows <HI>Pillicans,</HI> which could not be conjectured to come from any Country, but one of the two before named.</P>
<P>In <HI>Quivira,</HI> there are but two Provinces that are well known to the <HI>Europeans,</HI> and tho&s;e are <HI>Cibola</HI> and <HI>Nova Albion Cibola Lys</HI> on the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> where a
<PB N="216" REF="116"> City gives that Name to the Province; the next to it is called <HI>Tolontua,</HI> a plea&s;ant place in a very tem|perate Air, Scituated on a River of that Name; the third Town that offers is <HI>Tinguez,</HI> inhabited by <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and in it, the Je&s;uits have a &s;tately Col|lege, and are appointed to Preach to the <HI>Indians</HI> in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P><HI>Nova Albion,</HI> lies on the <HI>West</HI> &s;ide towards <HI>Tarta|ry,</HI> this was di&s;covered in the Reign of Queen <HI>Eli|zabeth,</HI> by the Renowned <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> who gave it this Name upon the King of the Coun|tries Surrendering his Crown of Network and Fea|thers, curiou&s;ly wrought, and &s;ubmitting him&s;elf and people to the Queen's Protection. It is in &s;ome parts inhabited by a few <HI>Spaniards,</HI> but not yield|ing any con&s;iderable &s;tore of Riches, they have not much coveted to People it, though it abounds with Fruit plea&s;ant to the Eye and Ta&s;t. The People are very Curteous and Affable to Strangers, but mo&s;tly given to their old Idolatry, practi&s;ing Charms; and &s;ome affirm they dance with the De|vil on certain mid-night Fea&s;ts, and revels, offering him human Sacrifice.

<P>The next belonging to <HI>Mexico</HI> in the <HI>Northern</HI> Tract, is <HI>Jucalan,</HI> the fir&s;t that Di&s;covered it by <HI>Franci&s;co Hernandez de Cordovo,</HI> Anno 1517. who asking an <HI>Indian</HI> the name of that Country, and he not under&s;tanding the <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> an&s;wer <HI>Jucatan,</HI> which in the <HI>Indian</HI> Language, is, <HI>What do you &s;ay,</HI> and from thence they named it, and &s;o it has ever &s;ince been called. This Country is at lea&s;t 900 Miles in Circuit, and a kind of a Penin&s;ula. It is fixed over again&s;t the I&s;land of <HI>Cuba,</HI> and divided into three parts; <HI>Jucatan</HI> properly &s;o called, which has in it the Cities of <HI>Campeche, Valadolid, Merida, Semancus,</HI> and one which for its Greatne&s;s and Beau|ty, they call <HI>Caire</HI> the chief; the Commodities here are Honey, Wax, Hides and Sugar, Cana, Fi&s;tula, Sar&s;aparila, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As for Food, it produces great
<PB N="217" REF="116"> &s;tore of <HI>Indian Maize,</HI> and is well Watered and Wooded in all parts; the Timber is &s;o good, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Build Tall-Ships there; they have &s;tore of Turkeys, and other Fowl, which with other Commodities, they pay as Tribute to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> for their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, who keep them low and poor, which makes them apt to fall into Mutinies and Rebellions.</P>
<P>Another part of this Track is called, <HI>Guatemala,</HI> where the Cruelty of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> has de&s;troyed near a Million of the Natives; yet this Country is populous, and has many flouri&s;hing <HI>Indian</HI> Towns in it. The chief Cities are <HI>Guatemala, Ca&s;&s;uca</HI> and <HI>Chiapa;</HI> it is well Watered with Rivers, and has &s;ome large Lakes full of Fi&s;h, and at Sea&s;ons, co|vered with wild Fowl; it abounds in Fruit, Corn and Cattle.</P>
<P>The third part of <HI>Jucatan</HI> is <HI>Aca&s;amil,</HI> an I&s;land over again&s;t <HI>Guatemala,</HI> which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> u&s;ually at this day call, <HI>Sla Cruz;</HI> it lies advantageous for a Harbour, and the advantage of Trade.</P>

Before they were brought under &s;ub|jection, they had &s;tanding Laws, and many poli|ticks in their Government, particularly, if one rob|bed an other, he was not put to Death, but became his &s;lave till his &s;ervice had made Satisfaction for the Damage done; they had no Law for the Murther of a King, as concluding none would be &s;o wicked as to act &s;uch Villany. This Country gives a plea|&s;ant pro&s;pect, and abounds in all things nece&s;&s;ary for human &s;upport; here grows the famous Tree &s;o much Written of, which if a man touch but one of the Branches with his Finger, it pre&s;ently whithers: There are great Flocks of Parrots, as of Crows or Pigeons in <HI>England;</HI> al&s;o Turkeys, Quailes, Rab|bits.

<P>And thus much, having thought fit to &s;peak of the <HI>Mexicon</HI> Provinces, and the Dominion of <HI>Spain,</HI> wherein I mo&s;tly Travelled, I now come to &s;peak in their Order of the <HI>Peruanian</HI> parts, for richne&s;s in Gold and other Mettals.</P>

This Southern part of <HI>India</HI> is held to be Richer than the Northern, for although it wants the conveniency of Traffick by the Northern Sea, which the other has, and is therefore obliged to &s;end its Commodities to <HI>Pannama,</HI> and from thence have them Tran&s;por|ted over the Streight, or I&s;thmus, by the River <HI>Chiagree,</HI> to <HI>Portabel,</HI> upon the North-Sea, yet the great &s;tore of Gold, Silver, and other Mettal, make richly amends for their pains and Travel, and &s;uch &s;tore is found, that a Prohibition or In|junction is laid by the Court of <HI>Spain,</HI> not to o|pen new Mines, till the old ones are &s;ufficiently wrought; the huge Mountains of <HI>Poto&s;i</HI> are thought to con&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly of Gold-oar, and here grow all &s;uch Fruits as are found in <HI>Spain,</HI> be&s;ide ma|ny others natural to the Country; the Olives are larger than tho&s;e of <HI>Spaia,</HI> the Oyl &s;weeter and clearer, the Grapes yield Wine &s;tronger than <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wine, and here they have more Liberty than in <HI>Mexico</HI> to make it, becau&s;e it cannot be &s;o well brought from <HI>Spain;</HI> they have &s;tore of Wheat and other Grain, the Soil all lying under the high Mineral Mountains, being very Fruitful, the Water that de&s;cends fatning the Valleys, for there is but little Rain, and the Evening and Morning Dews give great refre&s;hment. The Vice-Roy has his Re&s;idence in the City of <HI>Lima,</HI> a place much &s;ubject to Earthquakes, and of late has been ter|ribly &s;haken, and almo&s;t de&s;troyed by 'em; there
<PB N="219" REF="117"> is held a Court of Chancery, and it is an Arch-Bi&s;hop's See. It is well fortified &s;ince the <HI>Buca|niers</HI> have made &s;o many Depradations and Pyra|cies on the Coa&s;t; two Miles from it is a conveni|ent Harbour or Port, called <HI>Callau,</HI> where the Ships lie that convey the Trea&s;ure to <HI>Panama,</HI> and other Ships that Trade to divers parts, and be&s;ide <HI>Ca&s;teella Aura,</HI> or <HI>Golden Ca&s;teel. Chille</HI> is very Rich in Golden Mines, which has cau&s;ed an ob&s;tinate War between the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> that Inhabit it, who are very hardy, and dextrous at Fire-Arms, mo&s;t part of them being the Sons of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Women by <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;o that a great many of the be&s;t Soldiers out of the <HI>Neatherlands</HI> and <HI>Italy</HI> have been &s;ent thither under an Experien|ced Captain, who has the Command, as a Re|compence for his Service in <HI>Europe.</HI> The <HI>Spani|ards</HI> by their Wars have got &s;trong footing, and are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of 3 principal Cities, be&s;ide many Towns of Note, as the <HI>Conception,</HI> which is a Bi&s;hop's See, <HI>Santjago,</HI> and <HI>Valdivia,</HI> this latter, took its Name from a Governor &s;o called, who&s;e thir&s;t of Gold through Covetou&s;ne&s;s to grow Rich on a &s;udden, in u&s;ing great Oppre&s;&s;ion, made the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Chille</HI> break out into a Bloody War, and &s;urprizing him in his Hou&s;e, poured melted Gold down his Throat, &s;aying, <HI>Since he had &s;o ear|gerly coveted it, he &s;hould have his fill of it, and &s;o much of it as &s;hould la&s;t him all his Life-time;</HI> and accordingly it did, for the &s;calding Mettal pre&s;ent|ly killed him, but the War ended not with his Death, but has at times continued ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Guiana</HI> and <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> the latter belonging to the Crown of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and States of <HI>Holland,</HI> by rea&s;on of their remoatne&s;s I had not an op|portunity to Travel there, and &s;ince I can &s;peak little of them, than what I have from Report, <HI>viz.</HI> that they are Rich, and Flouri&s;hing Provin|ces; I &s;hall pa&s;s them over, and return again to <HI>Ca&s;tella Aure,</HI> in the Southern or <HI>Peruanian</HI> Track.

<P>In this part of the <HI>Indies</HI> it was, that our Valiant, tho' Unfortunate Country-Man, <HI>John Oxenham,</HI> Arriving with about 60 Companions, drew a|&s;hore his Ship, covered it with Boughs, and pa&s;|&s;ing over Land cut down Timber in the Woods, of which, he made a Pinnace, and Navigating the South-Sea, took &s;everal <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Prizes, richly La|den with Gold and Silver, and &s;afely recovered the main Land; but there by the Mutiny of his

<P><HI>Nova Andeluza,</HI> has for its principal City <HI>Tocoio,</HI> by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> new Named St. <HI>Margrets,</HI> and an other little inferiour to it, called St. <HI>E&s;piritu,</HI> both Rich in Trade, and the Country throughout gives a good Pro&s;pect of Plenty and Plea&s;ure. <HI>Nova Gra|nada,</HI> is Situate on the South-&s;ide of <HI>Carthagena.</HI> It contains 6 principal Cities, <HI>viz.

It is &s;trong, by rea&s;on of its Situation, much among &s;tony Crags or Rocks, which environ it, and through which there are very narrow pa&s;&s;ages, yet is it full of plea&s;ant Valleys, which yield much Fruit, Corn, and <HI>Indian</HI> Maize; it affords Silver Mines, and many Golden Sand Rivers.</P>
<P><HI>Carthagena,</HI> the la&s;t Province of <HI>Ca&s;tella Aurea,</HI> is of a very Fruitful Soyl, but not without &s;ome evil quality; for it produces a Tree that gra&s;ped by the Hand proves a rank Poy&s;on, and the par|ty hardly e&s;capes without lo&s;s of Life, or Member; the Chief City is <HI>Carthagena,</HI> Surprized and Plun|dered by <HI>Drake, Anno</HI> 1585. who, be&s;ide a Rich Booty, carried from thence 230 pieces of Ordi|nance. It is now rea&s;onably well Fortified, tho' not &s;o &s;trong as <HI>Portobel;</HI> the City is Fair and ve|ry Rich, by rea&s;on of the great quantity of Pearl brought thither from <HI>Margarita,</HI> and the King's

<P>There are yet many Rich I&s;lands under the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Power, as that of <HI>Margarita,</HI> Situate in the Sea, near <HI>Ca&s;tella Aurea,</HI> called the <HI>Jewel-I&s;land,</HI> from the great quantity of Pearl and Precious Stones found about it. It is true, it is but poor in Fruit-Trees, Corn, and Herbage, having &s;carcely any upon it; the Water is likewi&s;e &s;carce, as is any thing good or plea&s;ant, &s;o that the Inhabi|tants in the hot-&s;ea&s;ons will exchange a Tun of Wine for as much curious Cool Spring-Water; but the Jewels got there make large amends, by greatly enriching the People, &s;o that there are ma|ny Rich Merchants, who have 30, 40, or 50, <HI>Blackamoor</HI> Slaves, kept purpo&s;ely to dive for Pearls, and other Precious things. The&s;e are let down in Baskets, and feel about the Rocks and places where they &s;u&s;pect they are, and will &s;tay under Water a Quarter of an Hour, and when
<PB N="223" REF="119"> their Breath begins to fail, they give the Sign, by pulling a Rope to tho&s;e on the &s;urface in their Boats, to draw them up with &s;uch things as they have rifled the Ocean of; and their Ma&s;ters are obliged to Fea&s;t and make much of them, lea&s;t out of a &s;ullen humour they &s;hould under Water be carele&s;s of &s;o weighty a bu&s;ine&s;s, where they cannot &s;ee them act, nor give them directions; for the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> though they love the Profit, are them&s;elves aver&s;e to the fatigue and hazard in procuring it; for many times the&s;e poor Divers are drawn up with a Leg or an Arm off, and &s;ome|times taken quite away by &s;ome devouring Sea-Mon|&s;trous Fi&s;h; at other times when they Dive without a Basket or Rope, they are &s;ucked by the Water under the hollow caveties of the Rock, whence they cannot with all their &s;trugling di&s;entangle them&s;elves, but there unavoidably peri&s;h. From this I&s;land, the Pearls are &s;ent to be dre&s;&s;ed and bored at <HI>Carthagena;</HI> where is a Fair Street, of no other Shops than Pearl-dre&s;&s;ers. Commonly in the Month of <HI>June,</HI> there is a Ship or two ready in this I&s;land to carry the King's Revenue, and Mer|chant's Pearls thither; and one of their Cargoes is &s;eldom valued at le&s;s than three or four&s;core Thou&s;and Duccats, which &s;ometimes falls into the Hands of Free-Booters.</P>
<P><HI>Cuba,</HI> is an other I&s;land, 300 Miles in length, and 70 broad, found out by <HI>Columbus,</HI> in his &s;econd Navigation to the&s;e Coa&s;ts; it is full of Woods, Lakes, Rivers and Mountains, the Air Temperate, the Soil very Fruitful. It produces Bra&s;s of exact perfection, and &s;ome Gold, though not &s;o fine as in other parts. It abounds with Ginger, Ca&s;&s;ia, Ma|&s;tick, Aloes, &s;ome Cinnamon, Canafi&s;tula, Sar&s;a|parilla and Sugar, great &s;tore of Fi&s;h, Fowls, and other Fle&s;h; &s;o that the &s;hips on their return to <HI>Spain,</HI> take in much Provi&s;ion here. The chief Cities are St. <HI>Jago</HI> on the Northern Shoar, but <HI>James de Vala&s;co</HI> is a Bi&s;hop's See. <HI>Havana,</HI> which is al&s;o &s;eated on the Northern Shoar, and is a very
<PB N="224" REF="120"> commodious Haven for Shiping, &s;o &s;trongly Forti|fied, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> term it the Key of <HI>America,</HI> to lock up the Door or Entrance; here u&s;ually Ri|deth the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Navy, and in this Port meet all the Merchants Ships from &s;everal Ports and Havens in I&s;lands or Continent, and common|ly in the Month of <HI>September,</HI> joyn all the Trea&s;ure, as I may &s;ay, of <HI>America,</HI> all the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s Revenues, with as much more of Merchants Goods, which is often worth 30 Millions: It has two &s;trong Ca&s;tles, one at the point of the Haven, where the Enterance lies towards the Sea, and the other on the other &s;ide within, almo&s;t over again&s;t it, and by rea&s;on the pa&s;&s;age of the Entrance is &s;o narrow, that not above one great Ship at a time can &s;ail in; the&s;e Ca&s;tles admirably defend it, or may well do it again&s;t a &s;trong Naval Force. I took a view of the&s;e Ca&s;tles, and found them very &s;trong and re|gular, there are be&s;ides others, 12 pieces of great Bra&s;s Ordinance, called by the Names of the 12 Apo&s;tles, yet the Dutch, and other Nations, have &s;ometimes in&s;ulted them in the Mouth of this Ha|ven, and taken con&s;iderable Prizes within &s;ight and reach of the Ca&s;tle Guns; and in the Year 1629. they took no le&s;s than 7 Millions, mo&s;t of it the King of Spain's Trea&s;ure going for <HI>Cales,</HI> and from one Friar they took a Cabinet of Gold Chains, Pearl, and pretious Stones, worth 40000 Duccats, and forced the Galleons on &s;hoar, in a River near the Port, which Mi&s;carriage being laid to the charge of <HI>Don Juan de Guzman Y Torres,</HI> the Admiral, at his return to <HI>Spain,</HI> he was Impri&s;oned, and &s;oon after lo&s;t his Head.</P>
<P>The next that pre&s;ented was another I&s;land, much greater than any I have yet mentioned, now called <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> anciently by the Natives <HI>Hatie.</HI> It is in compa&s;s 1500 Miles, the Air very Tempe|rate, Soil fertil, and has in it &s;everal rich Mines; there is a con&s;iderable Town from the Neighbour|ing Coa&s;ts, for this I&s;land produces Amber, Ginger, Sugar, Hides, Wax, and many other Commodi|ties;
<PB N="225" REF="120"> the Gold is here very fine, and the Sugar Canes larger than in other places, &s;o that one of them will fill 20, and &s;ometimes 30 Mea&s;ures.

Juna</HI> running to the Ea&s;t, <HI>Artihinnacus</HI> to the We&s;t, <HI>Jacchius</HI> to the North, and <HI>Naibus</HI> to the South.

<P>The chief City is St. <HI>Domingo,</HI> where there is a Pre&s;ident and Court of Chancery, with &s;ix Judges, and other proper Officers. It is likewi&s;e the See of an Archbi&s;hop, who, though he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not &s;o great a Revenue as the Archbi&s;hops of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Lima,</HI> yet his Honour exceeds them, for he is Primate of all the <HI>Indies:</HI> This I&s;land having been conquered, and &s;ettled, it bares Precedency by Antiquity; there are other rich trading Cities and Towns, as St. <HI>Tho|mas,</HI> St. <HI>I&s;abella,</HI> St. <HI>John Maragna</HI> and <HI>Porto,</HI> where the Merchants Trade much, and are very Weal|thy.</P>

<P>THus having taken a Survey, and di&s;cribed the greater Inhabited part of the new World (as many term it, which Nature had &s;o long re&s;erved from our Knowledge, as her private Tireing-room, that being decked in all her Beauties, and Golden Ornaments, &s;he might at length appear more glo|rious than at fir&s;t;) pur&s;uing my Method, I now in the clo&s;e come to &s;peak more particularly of the Inhabitants, and chiefly of the Indians, for the Hu|mour, Cu&s;toms and Religion of the Spaniards, which vary little in this di&s;tant Region, are already &s;ufficiently known to Europeans.</P>
<P>The Indians are Va&s;&s;als to the Spaniards, and for the mo&s;t part little better than Slaves, to be at their Beck, and fulfill their imperious de&s;ires with
<PB N="227" REF="121"> the labour of their Bodies, and the little Wealth they can &s;crape together, for though in the Towns alloted them, where they are in any Number, they are allowed Officers of their own, yet they dare act little without the concurrence of the Spani&s;h Magi|&s;trates, even among their own Tribes; and to keep their courage low, they are deprived of offen&s;ive Weapons, and great Penalties laid on &s;uch, where, upon &s;earch, they &s;hall be found. The Friars and other Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, command their &s;ervice for no|thing, having a certain number allowed at the pub|lick charge of other Indians to do their Drudgery, as fetching Water, Wood, Fi&s;hing for them, Till|ing and Sowing their Ground, and the Seculars al|low them but half a Ryal a day, though they com|pel them to leave their own Land untilled, leaving their Families to come many Miles to &s;erve their turns; and to this, they are pre&s;&s;ed to &s;evere Pe|nalties, being inflicting on the Refu&s;er for a &s;et num|ber of days, as &s;hall be required, and many times the&s;e poor Wretches leave their Wives and Chil|dren &s;tarving at Home in the mean time; and when they have done their Work, they are &s;ent a|way with little or nothing, except &s;ometimes Threats and Cudggeling, if they dare di&s;pute it, or &s;o much as murmur at what is &s;aid to them, or el&s;e turned over to an other that will give the Spaniard any al|lowance for their Labour, according to the fir&s;t, or &s;tanding Agreement, though the work be never &s;o hard, or above their &s;trength; though indeed, they are mo&s;tly of very &s;trong Bodies, and well propor|tioned in their Limbs, and would be far more in|du&s;trious than they are, had they any tolerable In|couragement. But &s;eeing their Lives and E&s;tates are at the mercy of the Conquerors, few, con&s;ider|ing their va&s;t Number, &s;trive to encrea&s;e Riches, but content them&s;elves with a &s;upply of ordinary Food and Rayment, going mo&s;tly Bare-footed in all Sea&s;ons, and any Pa&s;&s;enger travelling the Road, may require an Officer to furni&s;h him with an
<PB N="228" REF="122"> Indian or <HI>Moor,</HI> to guide his Mules, and carry hea|vey Trunks; and after they cavel with them at the Journeys end, for &s;ome pretended neglect, and &s;end them back with Blows in&s;tead of the promi&s;ed Re|ward of their labour. If they refu&s;e to Work when ordered, or run away when Hired, they are &s;ought out by the Officers, and publickly Whipt in the Market place; this, and more &s;evere U&s;uage, than I think fit to name, lea&s;t it &s;hould not be credited among&s;t compa&s;&s;ionate Chri&s;tians, makes many of them weary of their Lives; &s;o that coming Home from the&s;e Labours and Abu&s;es, they have refu&s;ed to Ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1+ letters"> and voluntarily pined them&s;elves to Death, notwith&s;tanding the Tears and Per&s;wa&s;ion, of their Wives and Friends, to incite them to a patient bare|ing of the Sufferings, and live.</P>
<P>As for their Religion, &s;ome in the remoter parts are &s;till Heathen Idolaters, paying Adorarion as covertly, as they can the imaginary God's of their Ance&s;ters, and lay a great &s;tre&s;s on their Protecti|on, as Fire, Air, the Sun, Moon, and other things by &s;everal Names; for anciently they Wor&s;hip|ed a great number of Gods, and had &s;tately Tem|ples Erected to them, &s;acrificing Human Fle&s;h and Blood on their Altars, either of Pri&s;oners ta|ken in War with one another, or &s;uch as volun|tarily offered them&s;elves, or were cho&s;en by Lot: The Names of their &s;everal Idols, and manner of their Antient Wor&s;hip not being proper to my Subject, but rather for a Hi&s;tory.

Tho&s;e that are able, are very careful to buy the Picture of one Saint or o|ther, as their fancy leads them, and give the Prie&s;t Money to have a place for it in the Church; and by this a great deal of Money is &s;crewed out of them, for from that time the Prie&s;t &s;tiles the Party, the Patron of that Saint, and he is obliged to bring Offerings, and leave before him, e&s;pecially on his Day, very con&s;iderable, which being left, the Prie&s;t &s;weeps away, and Converts it to his own u&s;e, &s;elling then the Wax Candles they offer ma|ny times over and over, which, with other things, brings a great Income. Where there is a number of the&s;e Saints in a Church, and often he &s;tirs them up with Tauntings and Revilings, to mind it as a Duty, or to expect &s;ome great puni&s;hment from their angry Saint, if they &s;lack in their Offerings, and many times he lays hold of Sickne&s;s in their Families, or Death of Cattle, telling them for want of their Offerings, and neglect of their Devotion and Charity, their &s;lighted Saint is Angry, and has thus puni&s;hed them, which frights them into large Contributions; on which, the Prie&s;ts lives Fat, and laughs in his Sleave at their Simplicity and Ignorance. Yet for all this, he him&s;elf &s;o lit|tle fears the Saint, that he will throw his Picture out of the Church, if the party who owned him dies, and none of his Kindred, or others, come at a &s;et time, after Proclamation made, with their Offering, to own and new Patronize him, decla|ring &s;uch Saints as have none to offer to them, are u&s;ele&s;s and incumber the places in the Church, where others might &s;tand who have Patrons that would bring Offerings; and the Picture being thrown out of the Church, is carried to the Town-Hou&s;e,

<P>The Indians are very Ignorant in their Devoti|on, and undi&s;cerning in matters of Religion; for if they be asked any material point, their u&s;ual an&s;wer is, <HI>It may be &s;o for ought they know;</HI> and in|deed, tho&s;e that &s;hould be their Spiritual Guides, labour to keep them as Ignorant as they can, that they may the better work their Ends on them, though when they come to Church, they out|wardly in Je&s;tures appear very Devout, and are careful when at the point of Death, to have a Confe&s;&s;or, and receive the Extream Unction, tho' &s;ome of the heads of them that are &s;omewhat more Learned than the re&s;t, are held &s;ecretly to practice Magyck, and traffick with the Devil; &s;ome affirm they can change their &s;hapes into Bea&s;ts and Birds, and in that &s;hape, &s;ome of them have been &s;hot, yet as &s;oon as Dead, they were in their own &s;hape again; though this, I believe, may be a tale of &s;ome <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who had Murthered them, and forged it upon them to excu&s;e their own Guilt. Yet this is certainly Recorded, that one <HI>Gomez</HI> and <HI>Lo|pez,</HI> Heads of <HI>Indian</HI> Tribes, and both in years, who had &s;eemed very Devout in the Romi&s;h Re|ligion, were ju&s;tified by &s;everal Witne&s;&s;es, to be &s;een Fighting on a Mountain; the fir&s;t, in the &s;hape of a Lyon, and the latter, in that of a Ty|ger, and when the fir&s;t came home, he was much Brui&s;ed, Bitten and Wounded, and of it &s;oon di|ed; and though he confe&s;&s;ed nothing of it to the Prie&s;t, who Confe&s;&s;ed him, and gave him the Ex|tream Unction, yet the latter by the Spani&s;h Ju|&s;tice, was &s;eized and Tryed, and hang'd as a Ma|gycian, or a Practi&s;er of Charms and Witchcraft. Its true, they had been a long time mortal Ene|mies, and the one might be guilty of the other's

<P>The Indians keep the Fe&s;tivals of the Romi&s;h Church with great Mirth and Jolitry, Singing and Dancing; to conclude them after an Antick fa&s;hi|on, they act the Show of the Wi&s;e Mens coming to Chri&s;t at his Nativity, with their Offerings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in their Churches or Chappels, and have eve|ry thing prepared there &s;uitable to that purpo&s;e, making great Mirth and Fea&s;ting after it is o|ver; and on &s;uch days the Prie&s;ts fairs well, for there are few that offer not Money, but Fowl, Ba|con, Coco-Nuts, Wax, Tapers, and the riche&s;t a|mong&s;t them, are procured to pre&s;ent the Kings of the Ea&s;t, who fail not to provide Gold, Frankin|cen&s;e and Mirrh, and all this falls to the Prie&s;t's &s;hare who manages the Show.</P>
<P>Their Funerals are after the Romi&s;h Fa&s;hion, unle&s;s upon &s;ome Di&s;gu&s;t they are refu&s;ed Chri&s;tian Burial, but that may be recalled for Money; they Marry, and live very peaceably in their Fami|lies, the Women being very Obedient to their Husbands, owning them to be their Lords and Rulers, thinking nothing they can do too much for them; they are very Fruitful in Children, and mo&s;t commonly Healthy, &s;o that though &s;uch mul|titudes of them have been purpo&s;ely De&s;troyed, con&s;umed in the Mines, and put in Lakes and Ri|vers, yet the Spaniards, who are not by half &s;o Fruitful, are but a handful in Number to them, though the&s;e few have &s;o broken their Spirits, and kept them under, that now they are of no Cou|rage comparable to what Hi&s;torians Report of their Ance&s;ters, who di&s;puted it in many well fought and Bloody Battles with the Spaniards, putting them hard to it before they could bring them under &s;ubjection, and &s;ettle what is now, by the Pope's Do|nation,
