For what more pleasante Sacrifyce can wee offer in this life, vnto our GOD, then to labour in all that euer wee may, to bring the Barbarous to Ciuilitie, the Rude to knowledge, the superstitious to the true &amp; liuely wor|ship of his name, to win them from darknesse to light, fro~ crueltie to curtesie, from vanitie to veritie, from death vn|to life? If wee bee not borne to profite our selues, but to seeke the aduau~ceme~t of Gods glory, how commendable an enterprise is that? how highly to be wished? how much to be furthered, which not onely encreaseth the profite of our countrey, but augmenteth the nu~ber of the faithful. Therfore God hauing decreed to make himselfe knowen as well by our Englishe Nation in some quarters of the vnknowen worlde, as he hath of late yeeres beene by the Spaniarde in West: and by the Portugale in the Easte. And beeyng mooued to take in hande this small transla|tion, by personnes of sundry callynges, and especially by diuerse moste excellent Pilottes, Maisters, and to|wardly young Marriners, muche exceedyng in knowe|ledge and godly lyfe many of that profession that haue been heretofore: I haue, other needful busines set aparte, perfourmed theyr requeste: And the thing that I much desired, for the loue I beare to good discoueries: And now dedicate the same to your woorshyp, as a speciall fa|uourer of all good knowledges, and of all enterpises tending too the glory of GOD, the honour of your Prince, and the publike benefite of your Countrey, be|seeching your woorship too take the same this my tran|slation

And also they doe not suffer nor permit in the Countrey any Uacaboundes, nor idle people, nor they suffer any of the naturall people of the Coun|trey to goe foorth of the Realme, there are an infinit number of people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word"> all kinde of Artes, and offices.

<P>_THere are in this realme many Cities &amp; very populous, inso|much that in a Card <HI>Geogra|phical</HI> made by the said people of <HI>China,</HI> which was brought into <HI>Portugal</HI> to the powre of <HI>Iohn de Barros</HI> a moste lear|ned historian of that Nation, there came marked two hun|dreth fourtie foure famous Cities, and they are numbered and noted out with this sil|lable <HI>fu,</HI> which is asmuch to say, as a citie like to <HI>Canton fu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> Panquim fu:</HI> and the Townes (which are very many in nu~|ber) with this sillable <HI>che<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">.</HI> The Uillages are innumerable, &amp; of great husbandrie, and some of them are of more the~ three thousand inhabitauntes and the difference which they haue, is that they bee not compassed about with walles as the townes are. Al the Cities for the moste parte are set &amp; plan|ted by greate riuers which are nauigable and compassed a|bout with deepe and broade marrishe groundes which doe
<PB REF="18">
make them most stro~g. The walles are made of great stones the height of a man, &amp; from thence vpwardes of brick made of the same clay that the earthen dishes that they bring from thence is made of; which is so stronge, that with greate diffi|cultie it can bee broken with Pikaxkes. In some Cities they are very heigh and broade, in suche sorte that there may marche foure or six men in a ranke or front vppon them. They are beawtified with many Bulwarkes and Towres from one side to thother, couered with most faire and beawti|ful coueringes and compassed about with galleries, where their Gouerners and Ministers are accustomed to go too re|creat themselues with the sight of the fieldes and Riuers &amp; of other great buildings which from thence are discoue|red. And there is a certaine space of grounde betweene the walles and the marrish ground, vpon which vi. men on horse|backe may march: and in the innermost part of the walles on thother side there is asmuch more voyde grounde vntoo the houses, that they may passe the watch without any imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">|ment, the walles are so whole &amp; without clifte or rift or shew thereof, as if they were but then newe made: and yet ha|uing in many Cities memorie of twoo thousande yeeres since that they were made: and the cause thereof is that in euerie Citie and towne the king hath an Officer with great wages whiche doeth not occupie himselfe specially in any thing, other than in continuall surueying of them, and to cause them too bee renewed. And therefore they haue order that hee which is Tresurer and receiuer of the Kings rents in such Cities and in the lyke places, doeth giue too him all that is necessarie and needfull for the reparing of them. This is so precise a matter that the lyke officers are visited and chastened if they haue not fulfilled all things which they are bound vnto in their office. The entraunce of these Cities are sumptuous, and of greate shewe and Maiestie&punc; with three and foure gates most stronge, and all things too them aperteyning, of Iron.</P>

And by reason the streets are so broad they make them with three gates and those which are in the middest are greater the~ those which are at the ends. The Arches are so broade &amp; so farre out intoo the streets and so made that the people are defended from the rayne &amp; the Sun: and vnder them is sold much fruite and other fine trinckes, and Iewelles of all sortes.</P>
<P>The houses where the kings Officers are resident in, are sumptuous and of a straunge buildinge, and so broade that some of them haue more roome the~ is in a good Town.

<P>In Townes that are neere the Sea coast, all the houses for the moste parte bee lowe, and within the lande they reise their Chambers alofte; &amp; of faire buildings.

of strange people that in old tyme matched themselues with them, when they went foorth of the realme and were conuersant with other people. In <HI>Canton</HI> and al other pla|ces of that coast, they are tawnie like vnto those of <HI>Fetz,</HI> and <HI>Marruecos,</HI> but al within the lande are of the collour lyke to the people of <HI>Spaine, Italy,</HI> and Flanders, whyte and red &amp; of good growth. The noble people of the lande, and those that serue in the warres, doo apparel themselues with silkes of diuers colours, and the poorer sort of people with blacke, and with serge, lynen cloth, and cotton wool, died, bicause they make no woollen clothes, although they haue greate store of woolles. They haue their coates made of such fashio~ as other were in olde tyme, with many pleits, long fawles, &amp; broade sleeues, and they make them fast vppon the lefte side, and doo garde their saide apparell with that that their gar|ments are made of, according to the degree and abilitie of e|uery one of them. They that bee of the blood Royal, and also such as be placed in the chiefe offices at honor and au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">tori|tie, differ from al other in apparel: for they go al beeset with golde and siluer round about theyr wastes, and al other Gen|tlemen doo cary their eares garnished therewith. Their ho|ses are very wel made and stitched, and their Bootes and shooes are made of silke very curious and fine. In the winter season they fur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e their apparel with furres of beastes, as of Marterns and Sables, and do bring them ordinarily about their neckes. They suffer theyr heare to growe long, wherein they haue great superstition, saying that they shalbee caried thereby to heauen: and they collour it lyke as women doo, and do gather it togither in the highest part of the head with a string, wherin they put through a naile of siluer. Those that are not maried are different from them that are: wherefore they weare theyr heare curled vppon their forehead, &amp; weare on theyr head certain high coyues, &amp; rounde, made of small stickes very fine, and wrought vppon with blacke silke. The women are commonly very fayre, except those that are dwel|ling at the Sea coast, of the parte that is towards the south,
<PB REF="22">
and those that dwel in the hilles and mountaines: the reste are very whyte and fayre in their fashion, &amp; some with good|ly eyes, and their noses very slender and comely. All are appareled with silke, &amp; the poorest sort with serge and lynen cloth. The coates w^t they vse, bee of the fashion of them that are heere, and the Petty coates with broade sleeues. They dresse their heare with most great care, they cary it gathe|red togither on the higher part of the head, fast bounde with a broade lace of silk garnished with stones &amp; peeces of gold. They paint themselues with the lyke curiositie as they do in <HI>Spayne:</HI> &amp; they hold it for a gallant thing, to haue their feete very little, &amp; therfore fro~ the tyme that they be little childre~, they bind their feete very much with clothes, for bicause that such as haue little feete are much esteemed. They liue very closly in there houses, for they are littel seene, their husbands willes is that they should so doo, for they are very iealowse. Whe~ they go forth of their houses, they are caried in chayres with courtines compassed about, with seruants and familier friends that do carie them, and that do accompanie them, in suche sorte that none are seene by the streetes, but people of low and base degree. The men doo buy the women whe~ they marry them, and pay for them to their fathers, much or lit|tel money, according to theyr degrees. And although that it be lawful for the~ to haue as many as they can maintain, yet they dwel with one alone which is the chiefest in reputatio~, and the rest they lodge in diuers houses. And if they be men of trade and merchaunts that are traders, they do place them in such Townes where their busines &amp; trade lieth. They doo not suffer within the Cities, that any common women should inhabite, but in the suburbes where is appointed vntoo them publike streetes for their habitation. All these for the moste parte are slaues bought from the powre of their moothers when they were children, for bycause it is permitted by law vntoo widowes that doe remayne poore, when they haue not where withal to sustein them to sel their children for their re|liefe: being oppressed with necessities, they go to riche mer|chaunts
<PB N="22" REF="22">
and offer their daughters that they may buy them. The which merchauntes moued with couetousnes do teache these yong maides too play of the Uirginalles and Git|torns and other such instrumentes: and after growing to ripe yeeres, they put them intoo the streetes too reise a gaine of their whoredomes. There is an accompt taken by an Offi|cer of the Kinges, which is appointed for this cause; vntoo whome the maister of these maides doth pay so much by the yeere, after the manner of tribute, and they to their masters euery Moneth asmuch as they doo agree vppon: and those which doo play of the Instrumentes and sing well, bee more esteemed &amp; of greater pryce. When they are olde they make them looke young again, with ointments oyles, waters, and with collours, and when they are olde and of no more pro|fit, they remaine free without any longer bondage vnto their maisters, or any else, mainteyning themselues of that which they haue gotten in their youth, with their naughty trade. And the boyes do serue al kind of seruice in theyr houses, vn|til they be of yeeres to marry, &amp; the~ their maisters are bound to seeke then wiues, and to prouide them houses, and to giue them trade or order how they may get their liuing, and these seruauntes must geue their maisters euery yeere so much in knowledge of their bondage, but the children of these slaues remaine free. They doo celebrate all their holy dayes in the night, and principally at the tyme of the newe Mones, as people that walke in darkenes, with great shewes and many inuentions, and with much Musike. And specially they doo solemnise the first day of the yeere, which is amongst them at the tyme of the newe Moone of Marche: and therfore they trim and decke vp their houses and doores with many car|pets and clothes of silke, and of diuers kinds of roses and flowres planting in all the streets trees most high with their bowes cut off, wherevppon they hang many lights, and also of the triumphant Arches which in these dayes they decke with bowes, paint them, and hang them with clothes of Da|maske, &amp; other diuers silkes. The Priests do assist in these ho|ly
<PB REF="23">
daies being richely appareled, and doo offer sacrifises too theyr Idolles, singing according too theyr fashion, and they are al ioyful with the musike, they sing very vnlyke one ano|ther in theyr voices, and diuers kind of instruments lyke too Gittorns, Uiolls, and Uioles of the bowe, Claricordes &amp; Fluites. And although they be not of the selfsame making as oures are here, yet they are much like to the~, and are very cu|rious, &amp; their voices do agree with the Instrumentes mar|uellously, &amp; they make a maruellous accorde in the sounde. They haue many shewes or playes very pleasant of great en|tertainement for such as do vnderstande them, they do them very naturally with great preparation; and very lyke to the matter, which they do present them for. And al the tyme that these festiual dayes doo continewe, they haue their tables set ful of meate of diuers sortes, as well of fleshe, as of fishe, and of al kinde of fruites, and of most riche wynes of maruellous raste, and they and their Priests doo nothing else but eate &amp; drinke at discretion vntill they can not stande: and in that point neither the Fleminges nor Almans do passe them.</P>
<P>In the principal dayes or feasts that euery one doth keepe as in the day of his byrth, they doo conuite their kinsfolkes and friendes, and bidde one another, and they send delicates and thinges too helpe them make their feastes. There are greate expences in these bankets, and those which make the~ for their pastymes, they spende frankely theyr goodes in them, they are serued with maruellous policie, and with straunge order, and if there be one hu~dreth guestes, euery one eateth alone, or by twoo and twoo, vppon littel tables moste gallant, so gilded, and painted with wildefowle, deare, and al other sortes of byrdes that they couer no table with clothes, but onely compasseth the table with a border or a frontall of Damaske in euery one that reacheth to the grounde, in the endes &amp; sides. Rounde about the tables they put many little baskets very curious decked with flowres with diuers diffe|rent fruites, and in the middest the meate very orderly, and prepared as wel of fleshe as fishe, brothes of diuers sorts ser|ued
<PB N="23" REF="23">
in rich dishes made of fine whyte clay called <HI>Porcela|nas,</HI> or of siluer. They eate very cleanely, for they touche not their meate with their handes, but with smal stickes gilded that they holde betweene theyr fingers, and with forkes of siluer: they drinke many tymes, but little in quantitie, &amp; they drinke it out of little cuppes made of the whyte fine earth that the <HI>Porcelanas</HI> are made of, too the end that they wold drinke very littel at a tyme. Women do helpe to serue in the meate and drinke, and too wayte at theyr tables: and when the tabels are serued the saide women do the office of iesters too make them merry and ioyful. They haue musitions in all these bankets and players vpon diuers Instrumentes, daun|cers and representers of comedies, wherewith they bee re|created as people without care, and without light of the glo|rie of heauen, not directing too any other ende but too the contentment and felicitie of this world, whereof they enioy the ful. The Lordes and the people of estimation are serued with much more Maiestie and curiositie, for they giue to the~ at euery tyme they chaunge their meate, cleane napkins, knyues, forkes, and spoones. They vse great courtesies, and good behauiour one with thother in their quaffing and drin|king making much one of an other. And they are so ielowse, that they suffer not their wyues to eate with them in these feastes and assemblies: but they agree and eate togither in some other place apart from them: and there goeth no man into the place where they are but certaine blind men that are musicions to make them merry. They vse a certain courtesie at their meeting very strange, they shut theyr lefte hand and couer it with the right, and hold them vp many tymes vpon theyr brest, in token that they haue them fast shut vp in their hartes, and to this mouinge of handes they adde vnto words of courtesie. And amongst the commo~ people that which they commonly speake when they meete any strange friends, that haue not seene one the other many daies before is, that they doo aske them, if they haue eaten? and if they doo answere, they haue not, they carie them to the vittailling houses, and
<PB REF="24">
make them great cheare, and doo banquet them at their dis|cretion: For as I haue saide, in all places and streetes, as well within the citie as without, there are a great number of vittailing houses, where they sell meate and drinke aboun|dauntly of many sortes of meates: and if they saye that they haue eaten, they carry them to other houses, where only they are serued with Conserua and fruites and shellfish, and sun|dry sortes of wynes, wherewithal they banquet and recreate themselues. And if there come any guests, newly forth of any other place to theyr houses, if they finde them not with theyr best apparel that they vse to weare at a festiual tyme, they speake not vntoo them, nor make any reckening of them, vn|til they come in the most rich apparell they haue, and in ap|pareling themselues so, they receiue the~ with great myrth &amp; gladnes, &amp; great courtesie. For they haue an opinion that it is not lawful, nor that they are not bonnde too receiue any guestes, which weare their common apparel, but such as doe come with their festiual apparel, and the best they haue, too shewe them that they haue caused with theyr coming, great feasts and gladnes in theyr houses. They vse too make very much of them at theyr comming, and theyr kinsefolk, neigh|bours and friends come too see them, and carrie them a wa|ter made of certaine hearbes sodden that is somewhat bitter and of a redd collour which is very healthful, and suche as they vse, ordinarily for too preserue them in health. All peo|ple in general giue themselues too labour, aswell in tilling the fieldes' as in other sciences and artes, and in the trade of merchandise, not permitting any ydle men. Neither is there<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">o Beggers.</NOTE> any poore people that doo begge among them, nor they giue them any almes, for they will that all get theyr liuinge with theyr labour. And therefore they haue this order if there bee any that are lame, &amp; criple, or of greeuous diseases, and haue of theyr kinred that are able to susteine them, and doo it not, the chiefe Tresurer of the king and other Officers in that place doo force them too doo it, and so they giue them what they haue neede of, according too the abilitie that euery one

hath: and if they haue no kinse folkes that are of wealth, then they commaund to prooue the same before theyr Officers or Ministers of Iustices, that they may commaund them to bee receiued into Hospitalles that the king hath to this ende in euery place, with ordinary Officers that doo minister and giue to euery one what they haue need of aboundantly, which coste proceedeth of his rents, and for the most parte al these are incurable vntil they die, they haue their names set down in their rowles and they themselues &amp; the chiefe Treasurer, &amp; keeper of the accomptes of the kings rentes doo visit the of|ficers and doo take accompt of the charges and prouision of the sick people. And if they find that they haue not done theyr dueties as they are bounde too doo in seruing and cherishing them, they are chastened without any forgiuenes. And for the blinde men beeing poore, they ordeine that they labour and work, and get theyr meate in grinding of wheat and Rise in milles, in place of moyles. And the blind women which are strompets they appoint other women too gouerne&punc; trim, and decke them, which haue theyr sight, and haue left this kinde of naughty liuing. They are al very ingenious &amp; fine of witte too doo any thing with theyr handes and chiefely they which vse too paint pictures; for they are maruellous painters of al kinde of byrds, as it is wel seene by the bedde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, tables, win|dowes targets and other lyke which they bring from thence to <HI>Portingal,</HI> and very quicke of natural vnderstanding, &amp; to finde out all kinde of artes&punc; They haue many Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">thes, and Waggons, carried with horses.

doo not indeuour any thing, so much as too deceiue the~ with whome they trade, as people without consciente, &amp; clothed in deceipt.

that which remaineth lowest, they make the grossest or cour|sest, whereof the common people are serued, and they are fashioned euen in the sorte and maner as our earthen dishes are made heere, and they dry them in the sonne, and after they paint them, as they liste, with the inke of Anil which is fyne, as by them you may perceiue, and when they are drye they glase them, and they bake them. In the Prouince called <HI>Saxij</HI> are made the beste: and the greatest Fayre and sale of them, where they are moste sold, is in <HI>Liampo,</HI> which is a Citie of the same Prouince. The artificers and craftesmen are dwelling in the open places and streetes as they are here. There are goldesmithes that woorke vppon golde and siluer curiously, and maruellous gilders and grauers of gold which haue great shoppes full of counting houses and pain|ted &amp; garnished Chestes, and many Chayres gilded with gold, &amp; some with siluer of such as they cary theyr gouerners and other chiefe Officers of theyr common wealthes on theyr shoulders, which are very rich, and of great pryce, and specially one sorte of them which are made very high, and couered with windowes made with a lattesse of Iuory, that they which are within may see those that are without, &amp; they not seene. These do serue to carry women when they passe in the Citie. They haue many rich beddes, tables, stooles, smal chestes so gilded and curiously wrought and painted w^t gold, and other materialls, that it is wonderful to our great arti|ficers that we haue here.

them according as they melt the latten in <HI>Norwey,</HI> but it is more lyke too glasse, for it breaketh easilie. There are more shoemakers then of any other science, bicause it is a thing that is much vsed and spent. In the Cytie of <HI>Canton</HI> there are twoo greate streetes of them without any other person of any other occupation that dwel amongst them, but there are many scatered abroade in other places of the Citie. In one of these streetes are solde riche stuffe, wherewith they make bootes and shoes that are couered without with silke of coullours with riche stringes, which is made very gal|lantly. There are Bootes of ten Ducats price; and of a Du|cat according to theyr goodnesse, and shoes of two Ducats and so downewarde, vntoo a maruedie which is the vi. parte of a pennie, and are of strawe, that the riche and poore may weare euery one as he listeth and as theyr abilitie serueth. In al other artes, there are a greate number of craftes|men very curious and of all thinges greate abundance. And they are so giuen too theyr owne profit, that of dogges bones and of other beastes, they serue themselues therewith in steede of Iuory, and of olde ragges and rindes of trees, and of canes they make paper and of small peeces of silke: of this they serue themselues too wryte vppon, and the rest for too rolle peeces of Damaske and Taffetas and other silkes in. They buy the dung of the houses for theyr grownd in the fieldes and especially for theyr garden hearbes. They bring vpp byrdes too singe, and they teache them too make visages; they apparel themselues of diuers fashions. They make all these inuentions and many other too get mony, wherewithall too passe theyr life.

And in the Shouldes of <HI>Chiloa,</HI> which doth extende vnto the Iland of <HI>Ceilam</HI> to|wards the west part of <HI>Coroma~del,</HI> it is affirmed by those of the land, that there was lost a great fleete of their Shippes which came vpon the <HI>India&punc;</HI> by meane they were not perfect in the nauigation of those Seas. And it is also sayd that they were Lordes of <HI>Laoa,</HI> and of the Realmes of <HI>Malaca, Sia~,</HI> and <HI>Chapaa,</HI> as commonly it is affirmed. And it semeth to be so, by reason that all the people of these Realmes are in ma|ners and conditions like to those of the <HI>China.</HI> But in this point as it seemeth they had more wisdome then the Grekes, Oarthaginenses, and Romaines, the which for to conquer o|ther straunge Countreys farre off, went so farre from their owne, that they came to lose their owne Countreys at home.

And considering this, they woulde not so experiment their harmes and hurts any longer: but seeing how the <HI>India</HI> did consume them much people, &amp; also great riches of their owne Realme, and that they were much troubled and tired of their neighbours, at such time as they went abroade conquering other kings landes, and hauing in their owne Countrey golde, siluer, and all other metall, and much naturall riches of their owne Country, and such great store of marchandize, that all other forraine nations did profite by, and themselues not profite of the benefites of any other Countrey.

And they suffer them not to carie with them any shippes aboue the burthen of one hundreth tonnes, or one hundreth and fiftie, bi|cause they should not go farre of.

And they are made to growe and increase in short time with the dung of Kine. And in all the ditches of the Cities there is cast in, and doe breede after this sort great quantitie, the which the gouer|nours and officers of the King doe enioy: whereby is vnder|stoode the maruellous industrie which they vse for to enioy the great abundance thereof.

And the Barkes that are ap|pointed for this fishing do come togither, and are put in com|passe in the middest of the Riuer, and they doe binde fast the gorges or mawes of these birds, bicause the fishe should not discende downe to the guttes, and they cast them out to fishe, and to swallow downe vntill they fill theyr mawes of small fishes, and if they meete with any great one, they take him out of his bill, wherewith all they returne into the Barke to cast out all he hath taken. After this sort they continue theyr fishing vntill they haue what they will, and then they vnlose them, and do returne them to their places, that they may fill themselues at their owne will, and so they put them into their cubbes as before. Some part of these fishes the king doth giue to his officers, and the rest is distributed for the proui|sion of the Cities for to encrease his reuenues. The Barkes wherein the gouernors and the officers do saile in, haue their couerings high, and theyr cabans verie well wrought, and gilded both without and within, with theyr windowes, &amp; case|mentes adorned with fine shewes.

<HEAD>The xii. Chapter sheweth howe that of all this great Realme of China one onely Prince is King and Lorde: and of his Councell and Maiestie, of his house, and Court.</HEAD>
<P>_AL this great Realme is sub|iect to one onely king and mo|narche which doeth gouerne &amp; reigne in it. And there doth succeede in the Realme from fathers to sonnes, and for lacke of them it goeth to the next in kinred: but, as they marry ma|nie wiues, according to the maner of the Turkish Empe|rours, verie seldome times they lacke successours. The first child that is born of any of his diuerse wiues is of force inhe|ritor of the Realme: &amp; to the rest of the children after they are maried, there is appointed to them Cities, wherein they shall liue priuately, where they are prouided of all thinges that are needfull for them, according to their degrees, with expresse commandement that they go not forth of them, nor euermore after to come at the Court, vpon paine of losse of theyr liues. And when in olde time the kings maried their sonnes, they made a solemne banquet vnto all the knightes and principall Lordes of his Court, and did commaunde to carie with them their sonnes and daughters richly appara|led, and trimmed; and in this congregation came the Prin|ces, where all the Ladies were ioyned in companie, and there they choose for their wiues such as to them seemed best and fayrest, and the yong women did the like of the yong men, but nowe they marie themselues with those of theyr owne kindred.

<P>The dwelling houses where these Princes dwell are ve|rie<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ample hou|ses with Princely plea|sures.</NOTE> great, for within them they haue all the pleasure and con|tentme~t that is to be thought, aswell of Gardens, Orchards, Pondes of fish of diuerse sortes, as also of Parks, where they haue diuerse kinde of deare and foule, such as may be had in Mountaines and Riuers, all compassed about with walles, which maketh more compasse than a great towne. And as they vnderstand in nothing else but in making much of them selues: they are commonly fat, of good conditions, peaceable, and liberall with straungers. They giue themselues much to Musicke, wherewithall they passe the time, and in other quiet exercises. The gouernours and the kings officers are bound to visite them in all their festiuall dayes, and if they ride along by their doores on horse backe, they alight downe, and if they be caried in Chaires they descend downe also, and they passe by making little noyse, as men that make no shew of their authoritie, nor ordinarie pompe as they are accusto|med to doe. And for this cause they haue their gates of these houses painted with red oker, bycause they shal be knowne.

The king doth sende euerie three yeares a Chaen, which is as one should say a Iudge of residence to euerie Prouince, that hee may visite the gouernours and officers thereof. And this vi|sitation being ended, hee dooth commaund that in the chiefe Citie there be ioyned the most learned studentes of the most Cities of that iurisdiction, &amp; with the most learned lawiers, and of most authoritie, they are all examined, and such as<NOTE PLACE="marg">Graduating.</NOTE> they fynde sufficient, they doe graduate with much solemni|tie, and with great ceremonies, making themselues merie in these feastes certaine dayes with much musicke, daunces, Comedies and banquets: where withall hee sendeth them to the Court, that they may receyue the signes of men of lawe, which are certaine Coyfes with eares, and also hat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">es, and broade and long gyrdles, and there they remaine vntill their letters patients of their Offices be giuen them.

The rest of the Offices are giuen by the king himsefe, but these rise no higher in degree, but to haue this title of Captaine generall, for to enioy many liberties, freedomes and gaine, which is an ordinarie thing to such.</P>

And in remembraunce that he hath beene continually resident there, they haue in that Citie in the house of the trea|surer of the kings rentes in that Prouince a table of Golde,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A table o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> golde.</NOTE> wherein is written the name of the king that then reigned, couered with a riche Curteine, and they goe to it and reue|rence it, as though it were the king himselfe. And so all the Officers and Lawyers, and chiefe Gouernours are bounde to drawe the Curteine aside in all festiuall dayes, that is, in the time of the newe Moones, which amongest them is the first day of the Moneth. And in the rest of the Prouinces, there are other Tables like to this, but they go not to them to make anie reuerence, but when they doe discouer them: whereby you may vnderstand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> the veneration that they giue<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kings title.</NOTE> to their prince. And they giue him title of the Lorde of the worlde, and the Sonne of heauen. The seruants and suche as serue in his house are gelded men, by reason of the num|ber of wiues they haue, and so are the most part of his chiefe Counsaile bycause that with more assurance they may go in to him, &amp; consult with him in the businesse of the gouernment of his Realme, and estate of his warres: and no others doe speake with him but those. His Realme is so large and long, that for to goe by iourneys from the Citie of <HI>Can|ton,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An argu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> of a larg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> dominion.</NOTE> to his Court, is foure or fiue monethes iourney: and yet there are other Cities further. Hee hath knowledge euerie Moneth, and relation of all thinges that doe happen in eue|rie Prouince, aswell touching the state, warres, and rentes,
<PB REF="34">
as of al other successes, with ordinarie postes that the Gouer|nours do dispatch to him for this effect. The same order of the poste is as we haue among vs. <HI>Barros</HI> doth write, that they runne with collers of Belles, and others that haue beene in that Countrey say, they vse to blowe with a horne to aske hor|ses, and to giue knowledge to Barkes to passe Riuers. The Embassadours of Princes beeing his friendes or enemies, are receiued with greate veneration: they lodge them, and prouide them of all things needful with great liberalitie: and when they come where the king is, al the Lords and knights of the Court go forth to receiue them, &amp; they giue them great gifts and presents, and honor them with the title of Lawiers. Some kings being farre of from him, as the king of <HI>Aua, Siam, Melitij, Bacham, Chabam, Varagu,</HI> which fell to the north partes of <HI>Pegu,</HI> and do acknowledge him obedience, in remembrance that in olde time they were his subiectes, they send him ordinarily their Embassadors with some present, &amp; for the great iourney they haue to this kings Court, they al|wayes send with the embassage foure or fiue persons, euerie one with like authoritie, that if it happe some of them to die in the way, or vntill they be dispatched from thence: and if they die not of anie disease, they alwayes poyson one or two of the~ in some banket, vnto whom they make verie sumptuous Se|pulchres, with Epitaphs conteining what they were, and the cause of their comming, and by what prince they were sent: and this is for to continue the memorie and greatnesse of the renowne of his Realme. The Embassadors of the rest of the Princes are so priueleged in such sort, that those of his coun|saile hauing condemned too death one <HI>Bartholomew Perez,</HI> and all the rest of his companie that was sent to this cou~trie, by the gouernour of the <HI>India</HI> as Embassadour of the king <HI>Don Emanuel</HI> of <HI>Portingal,</HI> surmising that their embassage was false, and that they were spies, by reason of a certaine relation giuen against them by the embassadors of the king of <HI>Malaca,</HI> and the king himself vnderstanding of the matter, did commaund, that their Embassage being false or true, it
<PB N="34" REF="34">
was sufficient that there should be no hurt done to their per|sones, seeing they were entred within the realme with the title of Embassadors. Other there are that come for some common weales, which are Lordes that do owe obedience to him: they make no enterteynment to such, but vse them with a strange kind of Ceremonie. When they say to them that they shall go to see the king, they appoint them the day and houre, and they cause them to goe on foote, or on horsebacke, with bridles of strawe for humilitie. And in comming too a great place that is before the kings house, they stay vntill there come vnto them an Officer of the kings, who doth the office of the maister of Ceremonies, and doe commaunde them to passe forwarde. And at a certaine place they kneele downe, &amp; hold vp both theyr hands togither, as though they prayed to God, &amp; they beholde one quarter part of the houses of the kings palace, where they tel them that the king is, &amp; at times in equall space, they make other fiue times their pray|ers, and without turning their shoulders, they returne backe|warde with the like Ceremonies: and this being done, they send them away. This say they, is to go to see the king. If they giue them licence to say what they will, they remaine in the last prayers on their knees, vntill there come to them an other officer which is the Secretarie that writeth downe all that they aske, and with saying to them that they will consult of it with the Lord of the world, they are sent away for that time, vntill they bee dispatched with the determination and opinion of his chiefe Coun|saile.</P>

<HEAD>The XIII. Chapter sheweth of the Presidentes and Officers, which are in euery Prouince, and the or|der which they haue in the Gouernment of them.</HEAD>
<P>_THE King doth prouide Of|ficers for the Gouernment of euery Prouince, besides ordi|narie Iudges, which are in some prouince more the~ three<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 word">. officers prouince.</NOTE> thousande; as also fiue Presi|dents; and euery one of them hath his iurisdiction by him|self, of diuers causes: the chief of them is called the <HI>Tutan,</HI> which is a Uiceroy or gouerner of al the Prouince, vntoo whome they come generally with the knowledge of al great griefes and smal offences. And al the penalties thereof, the ordinary charges being taken away, he sendeth to the court, and with the relation of al the newes that doeth happen eue|ry moneth. His aurtoritie and maiestie is so great, that he is not resident where the rest of the Lawyers are, bicause hee wil not be visited and frequented of them. The second in dig|nitie is the <HI>Ponchasi,</HI> which is asmuch too say, as the chiefe gatherer of the kings rents, and President of the Counsel of the kings reuenues. This office executeth he without the cou~ sel of any Lawyers. There are many other officers that doo serue to recouer the kings rentes with the which they come to the <HI>Tutan</HI> as afore saide, and it is at his charge too com|maunde too pay al mens wages, ordinary and extraordinary charges, &amp; to take accompt of them, as head Gouerner of al inferiour Officers. The thirde in dignitie is the <HI>Anchasi,</HI> which is the President of the ciuil and criminal Iustice who doth see and determine withal his hearers and Officers all wightes and buzines, which goe in degree of appellation to his tribunal fro~ the rest of the ordinary <HI>Iudges</HI> of that Pro|uince,
<PB N="35" REF="35">
&amp; all other thinges which are conuenient for the good gouernme~t &amp; expedition of iustice. The fourth is the <HI>Aytao,</HI> who is the purueiour general, and President of the Counsell of warres, too whome doth aperteine the liuing of men and prouiding of shippes, vittailes, and munitions for the ships of warre, that goe to the Sea, and for armes by lande and for ordinary garisons of the cities and frontier Townes, and to know what straungers do come, and from whence they come and what they wil. The fifth is the <HI>Luytisi,</HI> which is the Cap|taine general that doth put in execution that which is ordei|ned by the <HI>Aytao</HI> and those of his councel. And whe~ there is giuen occasion of any warres of importa~ce with any migh|ty Prince, then goeth this President in person too rule or gouerne in them. Al these Officers are of great auctoritie, and such as are officers vnder them, are wel taken &amp; of great estimation. Euery one of them, excepte the <HI>Luytisi,</HI> haue ten hearers or Iudges in his councell, which doo assist him, ordinarily for the dispatching of his buzines, which are men of great auctoritie and estimation: and when they be in cou~|cel, fiue of them doo sit of the right side of the President, and fiue of the left. Those that sit on the right side be of more pre|heminence then the other fiue, in that they weare girdelles of golde, and yellow hattes: and they of the lefte side, do weare gyrdelles of siluer, and theyr hattes are blewe. And it is not permitted that any other Iudges of the Lawe weare these gyrdelles of golde and siluer and hattes of these collours, vnlesse they bee such as are Capteynes or other officers of the men of warre. And if by chaunce the Preside~t dye, there doth succeede in his place the most auncient Iudge next too him. And when there is any need to go to visit the Prouince, there goeth one of them with the auctoritie that euery one of them haue too put order in the thing that is conuenient to be reformed. These Presidents and the other Iudges do bring in theyr shoulders and brestes the kings armes, and they are a certain kind of serpents woeuen with threed of gold. They haue many other inferiour officers: and although they be but
<PB REF="36">
Lawyers they alwaies speake too them kneeling on theyr knees, except onely the head keeper of the prisons which is an office amongst them of much estimation. This ma~ when he commeth in kneeleth down, &amp; ryseth vp again whe~ he spea|keth to the~. And when these Iudges come newlie too the pro|uinces, there go forth to receiue them al the men of the warre with many banners and other souldierlyke shewes, and all the rest of the Lawyears and officers with great myrth and ioy. They haue on these dayes al the streetes very much dec|ked with diuers sortes of silkes, and with bowes &amp; branches and with dyuers sortes of flowres of most sweete smel, and they accompany them vntoo the streetes where they muste lodge with much musike and diuers sortes of instrumentes, Lykewise the king doth commande to prouide with the opi|nion of al his counsell al the rest of the ordinarie Officers of the Cities and Townes of his Realme, with consideration that they bee not of the saide Countrie whether they shal go to minister Iustice, that they bee not moued by affection too doo what they ought not, nor behaue themselues with inso|lencie, nor yet that they bee not made mightie, with the auc|toritie in commaunding, in suche sorte that they may cause some insurrection and alteration. This Lawyers nor the rest of the officers that are appointed too them, of these supreme offices, do make any maner of preparation when they depart from the Court too the place of theyr gouermentes, but onely of apparel and a fewe seruauntes that serueth them, for in al places where they shal passe through, the King hath at his cost, houses appointed and officers, that shal lodge and serue them with al thinges necessarie, and doo prouide for them Horses, and barkes if they haue neede of them. And for theyr meate it is appointed what shal be giuen to euery one of the~, according to his degree and office. And this liberality they vse with al the rest of the Lawyers, generally although they go not prouided of offices. At such tyme as they come, they aske them if they will haue theyr stipende that is appointed for them, in meate or mony: if they wil haue it in meate, they
<PB N="36" REF="36">
serue them very daintily, as too men that haue auctoritie to commaunde too whippe those Officers if they doo not theyr dueties. And when they wil lodge in the house of some of their acquaintance or friendes bicause they wil be at more liberty too bee merrie, then they giue them that portion as is apoin|ted too them in mony. Al these houses are very wel prouided for, by such as haue the charge of them: it toucheth the <HI>Pon|chasi</HI> of the Prouince, for that hee must take accompte of such as are officers, of the expences that is made of all these vittailing &amp; lodging houses. In al these houses they lodge al the ordinarie officers that they may exercyse theyr Offices, as Notaries, serieants, porters, euen vnto the executours of Iustice, vnto whome the king doth giue meat &amp; wages suffi|ciently and are payde euery Moneth, bicause they should not carrie nor take any bribes of any person. And for this they haue an order that none of these Lawyers can prouide or co~|maunde any thing in Iustice, but that it must passe before al these officers, and in publike audience which is done in this maner. The Iudge is set downe in his tribunal, and at the entery in of the hal stande the porters which declare with loude voice the persons name that co~meth in to aske iustice, and what hee demaundeth: who falleth downe on his knees a good way fro~ the Iudge, &amp; doth propou~d with a lowde voice his cause, or telleth them by wryting what hee woulde haue. And this petition one of the Notaries doeth take and reade with alowd voice: and being seene and heard, hee doeth pro|uide and commaunde Iustice to be done therevpon, and doth signe it with his owne hand with red Inke, and if he doo not so, then hee doth remit too an other inferiour Iudge that he may do it. This maner of order is kept so precisly that by no meanes they can bee brybed, vnles the officers shoulde vn|derstande it, and as they shal bee by them absolued or con|demned in their residences they feare them, all these are ve|ry presise too execute that which they are commaunded as wel Notaries as Serieantes and the rest. And if any of the~ do make any fault in theyr office, eue~ at the very howre there
<PB REF="37">
is put in their hands a littel banner, and so doo holde it in theyr handes kneeling vntil all buzines at that audience bee dispatched and concluded. And foorthwith the Lawyer doth commaund the executioner that he giue him as many whips as too him seemeth good, which are such as heereafter shall bee declared: in such sorce that all those Officers go alwayes for the most parte with plaisters and markes, and this is so ordinary among them, that they take it for no shame too go in that sort: When one of these Iudges doo walke in the Cy|tie, he goeth accompanied with these ministers. Officers, &amp; other people among them&punc; and there goeth before him eight Officers by both sides of the streetes: the twoo foremost goe with maces of siluer made as oures are, put into certain long staues, and they signifie that these Iudges and Lawyers are in theyr office in place of the King: the other twoo that fol|lowe, doo carry twoo long canes in theyr handes on high; which do represent the trewe and rightful iustice they ought too doo: and thother twoo that followe after these doo carrie other twoo canes, haling them vppon the grounde, and knit to them certaine long red gyrdles, and in the point of them certaine tasselles which are the instrume~tes of iustice where with al they whippe. And the twoo porters go with certain tables listed vpp after the fashion and making of a target: wherein is written the name of the Iustice, and the charge and Office that he hath: and those that go before these do bid with a lowde voice, that they giue place, bycause it is not per|mitted that any man of what degree soeuer hee bee shoulde passe a thwart the street nor walke, as long as these Iudges passe, vppon payne too bee whipped without remission that shoulde doo against it. This Prince hath so great care, that his Iudges &amp; Officers as wel the Gouerners as Presidents &amp; al the rest should vse theyr offices wel, as they ought to do, that although he do send from three yeeres, to three yeeres of|ficers which are called <HI>Chaenes</HI> to take acco~pt of the Iud|ges, yet besides that, from vi. Monethes to vi. Monethes, or from yeere too yeere, hee doth dispatche with all secret other
<PB REF="37" MS="y">
extraordinary Iudges which are called <HI>Leachis,</HI> &amp; are men that he hath great trust in, and those that are very familier with him, that they may visit those Prouinces with so great iurisdiction and autoritie, that without returning too him, they may chasten al maner of offices be they neuer so great, and put out of office al Iudges &amp; Officers at theyr wil. And bycause they shoulde execut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> this with more Iustice, there is taken of them an othe of theyr faithfulnesse and secresie, giuing them to drinke three tymes of the wyne, they vse com|monly to drinke of, which is the maner of theyr othe. And bi|cause hee may goe with more secrecie, the Secretaries doo make the letters pattents without any name of him that shal goe, nor whether hee shal goe more then to shewe in the letters patents that in what place soeuer that Lawyer shall come and present those letters patents, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e bee obeyed as the king himselfe, vnto whom he sheweth by worde of mouth in secrete, the Prouince whether he shall go. And so hee depar|teth vnknowen without knowing vnto any other whether he shal go. And in comming too the place hee seeth, and vnder|standeth al things that are vsed there, and no man knoweth what hee is, nor what hee pretendeth, and in what sorce all officers do minister Iustice. And this not geuing knowledge of any thing what his comming is, hee staieth vntill a day that the Presidents doo ioyne togither with the <HI>Tutam,</HI> too make a general consultation which is once euery Moneth. Then he goeth in to present his letters patentes, &amp; presently they aryse euery one of them and goe aside with greate hu|militie to heare iudgement against themselues, and foorth|with they are executed. And if there bee any suspencion, then he doth prouide in theyr places other newe officers: and if hee finde that they haue serued wel, hee doth honor the~ much &amp; doth remoue them to better places &amp; of more trust. These are woont too visit the Schooles &amp; examine the Studentes: and such as doo not learne, hee commaundeth them too bee whipt and too bee put in prison, and the vnprofitable are put out of theyr places, &amp; such as are vertuous hee offereth them
<PB REF="38">
fauour and promiseth them hope of exhibition. There is an other office or dignitie aboue all these, which is that of the <HI>Quinchai,</HI> and is asmuch to say the sell of gold. This man goeth not out of the court, but when any great matter doeth concerne the king, &amp; of the good gouernment, and quietnes of the whole realme. In all causes as wel ciuil as criminal, the Iudges doo proceede orderly in theyr causes, and doo make theyr actes and doo examine the witnesses in publike before theyr officers and ministers, bicause there shall be no falsehod nor deceipt vsed in the as king of that which they know, nor in wryting therof. They examine euery witnesse by himselfe, and if they doo agree in theyr declarations and depositions they put them aside, and doo aske thone and tho|ther, vntil they come to differ among themselues, bicause by reason that thone and thother doo alledge they may come to declare the trueth the better. And when they can not vnder|stande the certaintie, they whippe them, and giue them tor|ment in such sort, that by one way or other, they may declare the trueth effectually. They haue great respect in these cau|ses too men of estimation of whome they presume that they are not persons that wil lye. In causes of great importaunce and that doeth touche graue personnes, the Iudges doo not trust theyr Notaries too wryte the informations, but they with theyr hands do set down al the acts. Of such as are prisoners for debt, there is a tyme appointed wherein they shal pay them, and if they performe not, they commaund that there bee giuen too them many whippes, and they turne and commaunde a newe. Another tyme, and if they pay not, they returne too whippe them againe: and in this sorte they pro|ceeded with them vntil they dye with strypes, if their kinse|folkes doo not pay for them. When any dweller wil passe to another habitation in some other street then where he dwelt before, or go too some other Towne, they haue a custome too ring vppon an emptie Bason by all the neighbours with a common crier which shal say that such a person doth remoue, and too what place, that if he owe any thing, that they come
<PB REF="38" MS="y">
to demaunde it before bee depart, bycause no person shoulde loose any thing dewe too them: if this person doo absent him|selfe without making this diligence, the Iustices do compel al his neighbours too pay al the debtes that he owe, bicause they were so negligent and did not aduise the Iustice of his remouing. Those which are Prisoners for thefte or murder, are kept perpetually in the prisons, vntil they dye by whip|ping, or by hunger or cold. For although they be condemned too death, they doo execute the Iudgement with such delibe|ration, that many yeeres after they come to die for necessitie, as before is declared, or of theyr natural death. And for this cause there are a great number of prisoners in euery Cytie and Towne. And it is affirmed that only in the Cytie of <HI>Canton</HI> are accustomed too be more then 15. thousand. And by reason there are many people, and there is littel almes giuen, the poore people doo giue themselues to steale. There is in this Cytie and in all the reste which are of the <HI>Metra|politan</HI> xiii. Prisons, and in euery one of them a wall of a great circuit very heigh, &amp; so large, that they haue within the~ lodges for the head keeper, and his officers, and for the soul|diers of the watche, and ordinarily there are gardens, and streetes and courtes within, where the prisoners doo walke by day, and there are many vittayling houses, where they dresse meate, and doo hire beddes, and Taylers shoppes; and other artes, that the prisoners doo vse, too sustaine and maintaine themselues. Of these thirtiene prisons there are alwaies occupyed six of them with men, which are condem|ned too death, and in euery one of them are a hundreth soul|diers and more with theyr Captaine, too keepe the saide pri|son. Euery offender doth bring hanging at his neck a borde which commeth too his knees and a spanne broade, wherein is written the facte wherefore hee was condemned, they go with fetters, but in the day tyme they are taken of, by reason they may woorke too get wherewithal to sustaine them, ouer &amp; aboue that which the king dooth giue them, which is a cer|taine measure of Rice euery day, vnto such as are conde~ned
<PB REF="39">
too dye, they shut them vppe in the night in certaine lodges, which are neere too the courts, and they make them ly vpon theyr backes, and vppon them doo runne certaine Iron chaynes past through certaine collers that are betwene pri|son and prison: wherewith they are so fast made, that they can not escape. And they laye vpon them certaine couerings made of timber, that there remayneth to them no more space but theyr length and breadth which is a most painfull impri|sonment. They neuer execute the Iudgement that is giuen vppon them, that are condemned too dye, but when the <HI>Chaenes</HI> and <HI>Leuchis</HI> doo go too take residence &amp; doo make a secret visitation. Then these Iudges do aske for the roules of them that are condemned &amp; the causes. And although that theyr sentences are confirmed by the king and of those of his chiefe Councell, they returne too see againe theyr factes, with the rest of the Lawyers that doo gouerne: and beeing seene, they chose among vi. or viii. of those that doo seeme too them too bee most culpable. And they commaund the head keeper of the prisons, that hee giue order too carry them too suffer execution. And this beeing done they turne too see a|gaine anewe the factes, that by any meanes or waies they may suspend the execution of some of them. And if they finde any not so woorthie of death as the rest, they commaund that hee bee put aside from the reste, and that there bee shotte of iii&punc; peeces of ordinaunce which is a signe or token that they take out of the prison such as shal dye. They turne to co~sult again to see if they can deliuer any other, &amp; when they come not, then they commaunde to shootte of other three peeces, that they may bee caried out to the fieldes: and before they go foorth of councel they returne too see theyr causes a new. In this tyme they are set vppon a heape of asshes and they giue them meate, tarrying for the last resolution, wherin they are accustomed to deliuer or relieue some. And bicause execution shoulde bee made in such as doo remaine, they commaunde too shoote of other three peeces of ordinance, which is a signe that they shoulde dispatch them: foorth with there are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">oung

all the Belles, and there is through all the Citie a great ru|mour, as though they were all amased, bicause it is a thing which is seldome tymes done. In these daies they shut vppe theyr shoppes, and no body doo woorke, nor they sell any thing vntil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">unne set, which is when they take the bodies af|ter execution done vppon them out of the fieldes for to burie them. And from that tyme they doo any buzines, and doo o|pen their shoppes. Also these Iudges of residence doo see the roull of the theeues which still remayne in prison &amp; in recom|pence of correction they commaunde them alwayes too bee whipte. And they vse in this cause so much rigour, choler, and haste, as they vse charytie and clemencie with such as they put too death, for there is no facte so much abhorred as that is. The whippes they geue them are most cruel &amp; they giue them vpon the calfes of theyr legges, theyr shoulders tur|ned downe warde and theyr handes tyed behinde them with canes as broade as a hande, and of thickenesse of one finger which they keepe in water, that they may worke the grea|ter effecte, in such sorte that at the firste stroke the blood co~|meth out, and the executioners doo whippe them togither, one vppon one legge and thother vppon the other and they do it with such dexteritie and cunning, that of only two stripes, I knowe not who is able too suffer them: and of fiftie or six|tie it happeneth that there dye many, bycause theyr sinewes are all loosed and vndoone. Some <HI>Portingales</HI> doo affirme that had beene in those prisonnes, that there dyed euery yeere more then twoo thousande men of these whippings, &amp; some fel made of them, and of hunger and cold w^t they suffe|red. The sayde Iudges are present, when they whip them: and all the tyme that it endureth, they are occupyed in ea|ting and drinking and in pastymes without any maner of griefe therefore, and by reason it happeneth that somtimes some of these Lawyers beeing bryved with greate giftes or friendshippe are accustomed too see at libertie some of these prisoners, and put others in theyr places, for there neuer lac|keth some miserable people that for a little gaine wil put

All these captaines are of the same Prouinces bycause the loue of their Countrey maye cause them to serue truely, and cause them to labour the more to defende them. And bycause there may be more quietnesse, it is not permitted that any man shall carie any weapon, to offend, nor too defende, but onely such as are men of warre. And besides these, there are in the frontier townes &amp; fortes which they haue, in the confines of the <HI>Laos,</HI> and <HI>Bramenes,</HI> and <HI>Tartarres,</HI> and <HI>Massagetas,</HI> ordinarie garisons for the defence of them, and of the number which haue bene spoken of, was within the compasse of 200&punc; leages, but this is done with aduantage, by reason that in all partes of the Countrie is great habitation, &amp; hauing captains which do giue them assaultes, they come as many to the defence as is needefull, vntill the king come with his great power, which he hath al|wayes in a readinesse, of manie footemen and horsemen for his garde and maiestie, and to bridle the comming in of his enemies.

<P>They enter into the warres compassed about with many seruantes and familiar friendes, which are footmen, well ar|med, and very gallant, for it is so permitted to all souldiers, and men of warre. And by reason this king is so mightie and rich, they which serue are paied at their time without any de|lay, &amp; with great liberalitie. And all such as shew themselues valiant, are highly esteemed, and rewarded with great gifts. The <HI>Tartarres</HI> and other enemies which they take prisoners in their warres, they vse them with no other captiuitie, then to place them to serue for men of warre in other frontiers of theirs, which do border ouer against other Princes, and they are payed as hee doth pay the rest of his subiects, and these weare certaine red hattes, and the rest of theyr apparell euen after the fashion of the sayd people of <HI>China&punc;</HI> The faced hattes all people do weare, which are iudged for an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">e offence to serue in any towne that doth border ouer against any other Prince, as those which go to <HI>Oran,</HI> or <HI>Melilla,</HI> and so they say in theyr iudgements that they banish them to weare red hattes. This Prince is serued with some Souldiers which are by nature of the high mountains of <HI>Russia,</HI> which are a free people, and liue after the maner of warriours, like to the <HI>Esquizaros,</HI> which are mightie men, and with red haire, &amp; great beards, and they weare cut hose like to the <HI>Tudesos,</HI> and broade swords, &amp; they are called <HI>Alimenes,</HI> whom some doe thinke that they are <HI>Almaines,</HI> but if it were so, there woulde haue beene knowledge of this great Realme long before. Like|wise hee is serued of other tall men of twelue or thirteene pawmes of height, and they doe assist them in the defence of the townes that stand in greatest daunger, of whom we can not vnderstande of what region they are, and they make so great account of their owne wisdome, after the maner of the Greekes, that they say that they are those which haue two eyes, and the people of <HI>Europe</HI> but one&punc; and that all the

<HEAD>The xv. Chapter sheweth of the religion, lawes, and ceremonies which they haue and vse.</HEAD>
<P>_IT is greatly to consider, that the <HI>Chinaes</HI> being so wise in their gouernement of theyr common weales, &amp; of so sub|tile a wit for all artes, that they are so false of vnderstan|ding, and so barbarous and blinde in the worshipping of their false &amp; vaine idolatrie. For they haue no manner of knowledge of the true God, more than they imagine that al things which are created, doth depende from aboue, from whence doe come the conseruation and gouernment of them all, without knowing particularly who is the author, at|tributing it to the heauen it selfe, which they holde for the greatest of their Gods, and so they signifie it with the first fi|gure of their <HI>ABC.</HI> They worship the Moone, the Sunne, and Starres, and all other Images which they make with|out respect, and some figures or shapes of Lawyers, and of the priestes of their Idolles which they were most affectio|ned to, in some principal seruice they had done. And likewise they worship any maner of stones that they sette vpon theyr Aultars, where they doe make their Sacrifices, and also the Diuell which they paint after the same shape and manner as we doe among vs. The common sort of people doe say that they worship him, for bycause the good people, hee ma|keth Diuels, and the euill people he conuerteth into Kine, and other kind of beastes. The men of most knowledge and that be most pollitique, they say they worship him &amp; regarde him, bycause he should do the~ no hurt. They haue in al cities and places of habitation, and also in the fieldes, a great num|ber
<PB N="45" REF="41" MS="y">
of sumptuous Temples, and of goodly buildings, which are of great Maiestie. There are two sortes of Priestes, and they are contrarie the one to the other in maners: the one sort goeth all shauen, and appareled in white, and with cer|taine high cappes made of felt somewhat piked before. These sort liue in common togither, and haue their cham|bers and lodgings after the maner of our Friers. The o|thers doe weare their haire long, and deuided in the higest parte of their head with a strike verie curiously varnished with blacke, after the fashion of a haud closed togither. They apparell themselues with silke or blacke Serge as all the rest of them do vse: they dwell euery one of them by them|selues: they assist in the seruice of the Temples, and in the festiuall dayes and burying. The one and the other are not maried, but they are euill liuers, and therefore they are not esteemed among the people, and they are punished with stripes amongst the Iudges for a small occasion. These peo|ple do offer in the Mornings and Euenings in their Tem|ples, Incense, <HI>Beniamin,</HI> the wood of the Eagle, and other things of different and sweet smels. And the place of praier which they vse in their house, is generally at the entrie in of their gates, where their Idolles stande. When they lanche their shippes into the Sea at the first making, the Priestes goe aparelled with long garments, being verie rich of silke to make their Sacrifices in the poopes of them, where the place of praier is, and they offer painted figures, and they cut and burne them before their Idolles with certaine ceremo|nies that they make, &amp; sing songes with an vnorderly tune, sou~ding certaine little belles. And they worship the Diuel, where they haue him painted in the fore part of the Shippe, bicause as they say, he should doe no hurt to the Shippes. In all this discourse they are eating and drinking at discretion. When they pretende to go vpon any iourney eyther by Sea or lande, or begin anie buzinesse that seeme difficult or hard, they vse lottes, and cast them before their Idolles. These are made of two stickes, after the fashion of two halfe nuts,
<PB REF="42">
rounde at the one side, and the other side plaine. And before they be cast, they returne to theyr Idols with fayre wordes, beseeching them to giue good chaunce, and fortune: for by them they thinke doeth come good successe, or euill to them. And if it happe as they desire, then they will make too them great offeringes: and with this they are cast, and if they fall with the plaine side vpwarde, or the one side rounde, and the other plaine, they haue it for an euill signe: and they returne against the Idolles, and they speake to them shamefull and dishonest wordes, calling them dishonest dogges. And when they be weary of calling them so any longer, then they turne againe with faire and sweete wordes, and aske them par|don of that which they haue sayde, and desire them too giue them good fortune, promising them more then before they had offered them: wherevpon they turne to cast anewe, and by this order they proceede praysing them, and setting naught by them. And when they tarrie long, and if it bee a matter of importaunce, they runne to them, and take them, and cast them into the Sea, and sometimes into the fire, suf|fering them to burne a little, and they whippe them, and spurne at them with their feete, vntill it happe to them as they desire, that is, the rounde partes of these stickes to fall vpward. And then they worship and prayse them with much Musicke and songs, and cary to them offerings, of Hennes, Duckes, and Rice, all drest, and a Pigges heade sodden, which they much esteeme, and a great iarre of Wine, and of all this they set some part of it vpon the Altar in a Platter wherein is the toppes or poyntes of the Pigges eares and snout, and the nayles of Duckes and Hennes, and a fewe granes of the Rice, and some droppes of wine, and all the rest they themselues eate before the Idols, with much mirth and ioy. When there dieth any maried man that hath a wife and children and familie, immediately after he is dead they apparell him with the best apparell he had, and they set him on a Chaire, and there commeth to him his wife, and doth put herselfe vpon her knees before him, to take her leaue of him
<PB N="43" REF="42">
with many teares, and pitiful words she speaketh, and conse|quently his children and kinssolkes after the like order, and and all the rest of his householde following. And this cere|monie beeing done, they put him in to a coffin made of the wood of <HI>Canfora,</HI> which is conseruatiue and of sweete smel, well made fast in all poynts, bycause hee shoulde not smell. After this they put him into a Chamber, which is hanged with white hangings of linnen cloth vpon two bankes, and do couer him with a cloth euen to the ground, where in is sha|ped and formed the dead man, very naturally made. And in another place of the house without, or in the gate house com|ming in, they doo put for ceremonie a Table with candles lighted therevpon, all full of bread, and of sundrie sortes of fruites. And in this sort they keepe him xv. dayes, in the which time there do come at the night season Priestes con|tinually to offer vp their sacrifices, and to pray theyr owne inuentions after the maner of Gentiles. They bring many Papers painted, and with certaine ceremonies they make, they burne some of them there, and the rest they hang vp in cordes athwart for this cause, and they cast them togither, making noyse that they sende the deade men to heauen. All their superstitions done, they take the coffi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">, and carie him to the field, where the rest of the dead bodies are, wherein time they are consumed. In all these dayes there are in the house the Tabels set with manie kinde of meates, that the priestes may eate and drinke, and their friendes and acquaintaunce that do visite them.</P>
<P>The mourning apparell which they vse, is most sharpe, bycause they bring their clothes made of most course wooll, nearest to the fleshe, girte with hard coards, and on theyr heades certaine nightcappes of the sayde cloth, with edges like to hattes, which falleth downe vppon their eares. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">eare this for father or mother two or three yeares. And if they haue any Sonne that is a Lawyer, he doth let the exer|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">se of his office which hee hath, and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">h retire himselfe all this time vntill he hath done, and then he returneth a fresh to
<PB REF="43">
the court, to do as he did before. But those that are not so nere in kindred, do apparell them selues with rawe linnen cloth, not verie course. They doe easily beleeue lyes and feigned fables or tales, that men be conuerted into beasts, and beasts into men, and other ignorant toyes like too these. It is not knowne certainly that any haue preached to them the Gos|pel vntill the <HI>Portingales</HI> came thither, more tha~ in the coast of <HI>Molea,</HI> which is the <HI>India,</HI> of the side of the sea of <HI>Bengala,</HI> which they cal now S. <HI>Thomas.</HI> Thither came an <HI>Armenia~</HI> on pilgrimage, &amp; did affirme to the <HI>Portingals,</HI> y^<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters"> at that time were there resident, that in the publike wrytings, which the <HI>Armenians</HI> had, there was relation and memorie that before this glorious Apostle did suffer martyrdome, hee past to the <HI>China,</HI> and there did preache the Gospell. And bycause hee wrought little fruite in them, hee returned to <HI>Molea,</HI> leauing some Disciples that hee had conuerted in that Countrey. Of the which there is no knowledge founde amongest them, more then this religious man hath decla|red, and sayde: that hee had beene in <HI>Canton,</HI> and from thence past to a small Ilande that standeth in the middest of the Riuer before the Citie, where there is a Monasterie of those Priestes gathered togither, and therein he sawe a Chappell, built high from the grounde, verie well made with certaine windowes gilded, wherein was the Image of a woman marueylously well made, with a Childe at her necke, and had before it the signe of a Lampe burning, and suspecting if it might bee anie rase of Christianitie, he did aske of those Priestes, and of other people that were there, what that Image did signifie: and no bodie coulde tell him, nor giue him any reason thereof, and so it coulde not bee de|termined, if by chance it were the Image of our Ladie that the Disciples of Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> did set there&punc;</P>
<P>There is not in all this Realme anie Iewes, nor rase of them. And it may be well vnderstood, seeing that the most meate they eate is Porke fleshe. Neither yet is there anie <HI>Moores,</HI> although there are some that haue discended of
<PB N="47" REF="43" MS="y">
them that are arriued thither from the Realme of <HI>Samare|an,</HI> by trade of Merchandice, and of such as were conuerted of the Countrey, but the most part of them dyed by iustice. These which are now, are discended of such as were vanished for great no offence into diuerse Prouinces, &amp; therefore there are some in <HI>Canton,</HI> and others in <HI>Cansi,</HI> but as nowe they are few, and the children &amp; childrens children of those which were vanished, and borne of women of the Countrey of <HI>China,</HI> all of them do eate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">orke, and drinke wine, and there is no man of remembrance of the sect of <HI>Ma|homa.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The xvi. Chapter sheweth of the order that may be had, wherby these people may turne to be Chri|stians, and of the nauigation that is made from the newe Spaine, vntoo the Ilande of the West partes, called the <HI>Philippinas.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_OF some religious men cal|led <HI>Iesuites,</HI> it hath beene vnderstoode that they be|ganne too preache the Gos|pell too these people, but by reason that it is not permitted vntoo straungers too stay ma|nie dayes in this Countrey, they were compelled too re|turne foorthwith without yel|ding that fruite whiche they desired, notwithstanding they found the~ very apt to be caught,
<PB REF="44">
and willing to learne, and easie to be reformed of theyr false Idolatrie, and with al humilitie they receiue it, and acknow|ledged the corrections of theyr filthines. He that first began this Catholike woorke, was Maister <HI>Frauncis Xauierre,</HI> one of the seuen Religious men of the firste confirmation of the saide companie, and was the first that came intoo <HI>Por|tingal,</HI> and that past intoo India, and from thence to <HI>China.</HI> But before he began to execute his Catholyke desire, he died in <HI>Canton,</HI> and was brought from thence too <HI>Goa,</HI> where his body lyeth buried in the Colledge of Saincte <HI>Paule,</HI> of the same Religion. The Religious <HI>Dominike</HI> declareth that throwing downe certaine stones vpon the ground which they did woorshippe, they came vnto him with such rage as if they woulde haue killed him, but he pacified them foorth|with in geuing them to vnderstand theyr little constancie &amp; their vaine Idolatrie, and as they are of excellent witt, they forthwith fell in to the matter, and thought well of his iudge|ment saying, that no man had euer taught them the like, vn|till that time. And with the selfe same excuse they excused them selues withall, when he did reprehende them of the fil|thie sinne not too bee named, vntoo the which they are much giuen, thinking that they do not euil therein. But the grea|test difficultie that these religious men founde, was, that the gouerners and ordinary Iudges do attende with great care that no newe thing be taught amongst them without order &amp; licence of theyr king, and as they are rigorous and readie to chasten, no man darre to bee a Christian without licence, al|though that they vnderstand it to be conuenient for theyr sal|uation: &amp; therefore it doth import with expedition that these inconuenie~ces be taken away, and that there be sent an Em|bassador too this greate Prince. And in that Embassadge might go learned men, and Religious, that should giue them to vnderstande the darkenes wherein they liue, and too per|swade them to bee Christians, and that he shoulde permit the~ too preach the Gospel throughout al his Realme, and howe that it is not hurteful too take from him his Lordshippe and
<PB N="45" REF="44">
gouernement but rather fauorable, wherby his subiects may obey him the better. This wil be easily obteined of him, &amp; o|therwaies for to attempte it by way of conquest, it will be so harde a matter as it may bee vnderstoode by his power and greatnes, and by that which is conteined in a Chapter of the relatio~ that the Captaine <HI>Artieda</HI> gaue to his Maiestie who was present at the co~quest of the West Ilandes w^t are called <HI>Philippinas,</HI> treating of this realme which worde for worde speaketh as foloweth. There are also to the Northwarde of these Ila~ds the firme la~d which they cal <HI>China.</HI> It is a great Countrie, insomuch that it is certainely knowen that it bor|dereth with <HI>Tartaria,</HI> for the people that trade thither, say that they haue ware with them. They are a people very po|litike, they worke Iron with percers of steele. I haue seene golde and siluer wrought so well with Iron as coulde bee in the worlde, and in this sorte they woorke thinges of timber and all other thinges. They saye that the <HI>Portingales,</HI> are good people, and that they haue a littel light of the world, but in comparison too them they see but with one eye. They spin golde as they doo in <HI>Milan,</HI> and weaue Damaske and other silkes with it. They haue all kind of armour as wee haue, and artillery Iudging it by certaine vesselles that I haue seene come from thence, that it is plaine and better cast the~ our is. They haue so good gouernment, that they say they make nei|ther Gouernor nor Captaine which is not a greate Astrono|mer. And first they shal pronosticate the tyme and chaunce that is too come, and it shall be prooued and seene to fall out true, that hee may preuent any thing that is to come. In eue|ry Citie and Prouince, there are garrisons of men of warre, they goe wel apparelled: they are as whyte as we are, and weare there beards long. The wome~ are very faire, although that all of them haue little eyes, they weare their coates and gownes so long that they touche the grounde, and they make their heare red with collours, and it is saide that they painte theyr faces. They say this king is of so great powre, that hee doeth bring into the fielde three hundreth thousande
<PB REF="45">
men, and twoo hundreth thousande of them horsemen. In thinges that are painted&punc; I haue seene brought from thence wherein are painted on horsebacke armed men with harnesse and salets and lances. The countrie is so good and so well furnished with vittaile, that it is thought to be the best &amp; most fertile soyle of the world: The <HI>Moores</HI> that I haue spoken withall doo affirme that they bee not so warrelike as wee are.</P>
<P>They haue Mouldes and haue printed bookes tyme out of mynde. If it please your Maiestie, that this Country bee seene with the sight of the eyes: I doo offer my self therevnto, geuing mee twoo Shippes of two hundreth and fiftie to~nes a peece, little more or lesse, and 40. Souldiers in euery shippe and the Artillarie, Munition, and Uittaile, sufficient and necessarie, with Gods healpe carying some order of Embas|sadge to the Lorde of the Countrie to enter in with my per|son, and too returne all along the coast by the newe <HI>Spayne.</HI> And too see the order they haue as well for the trade with in the lande as for all the reste if that will please your Maie|stie.</P>
<P>And in that which this Captaine saith that the king doth bring three hundreth thousande men intoo the fielde, besides the garrisons that he hath ordinarily in the Cities, &amp; townes that doo border neerest other Princes in this my opinion re|maineth verefied. And although they be not so warrelyke as wee are, as the <HI>Moores</HI> haue declared, I knowe not what powre were sufficient for so great a number of horsmen, and against people so wel armed, the Artillarie being so common to them as it is to vs. And seeing there is required that there shoulde passe thither, so greate a nauigation, and seeing this great Countrie doth fal within the compas of the conquest of our Catholike king, it wil be a thing of importaunce that his Maiestie doo commaunde too ordeine this Embassadge with the good will of his holynes, whereby this Prince may reduce it to the gouernment of the holy Catholike Churche, whereof may growe greate effectes in the increasing of the
<PB REF="45" MS="y">
Christian Religion. And this is very easie to be done, seeing that our <HI>Spayniardes</HI> are become so neere neighbors to that realme and the Nauigation soo neere and certaine as here in it is declared. There is in the new <HI>Spayne</HI> in the South part thereof twoo portes or hauens: the one is called <HI>Acapulco,</HI> which standeth in xvii. degrees, &amp; a half of heigth which wil holde many shippes although they bee greate, and thother is called the <HI>Puerto de Na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">edad,</HI> which hath the entry in of it very lowe, and standeth in nynetiene degrees and a terce large. From these portes do goe foorth the shippes that doo sayle too the <HI>Philippinas,</HI> and they goe too put themselues in the heighth that the course of the Iland is in, for the tyme when they goo foorth vpon this Nauigation which is in the ende of October the windes are alwaies Northerly in that coast vntil the end of April: Wherewithal they goe with the winde in theyr poope running west, and from the ende of A|pril vntil the ende of October they turne too blowe at West Southwest, which serueth them too returne, rising vpp intoo a higher degree that they lack no height. They met at their going with the Ilands called <HI>Barbudos,</HI> for they were so na|med, for bicause such as do inhabite there, do let their beards grow long. These people are apparelled with mattes made of the bowes of date trees very fine, and they haue no wea|pons nor warre with any Cou~trie, and theyr vittaile are <HI>Co|cos,</HI> and rottes and fishe, &amp; they haue hennes lyke to those of <HI>Spaine,</HI> more towards the west. They turne &amp; meete with the Ilands which they cal of the theeues which be xiii. and they lye in length North and South, the greatest may bee little greater then fourtie leages. They are al wel neere after one fashion and trade. The weapo~s they haue he s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ings, &amp; roddes dryed with the fire which doo serue them in place of lances. They shootte so farre with the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1+ letters">ings that no hargubuse can shoott fo far. They liue with Ryce and fish, <HI>Cocos</HI> &amp; rootes, there are in the~ great qua~titie of Ginger, &amp; so beyonde that more towardes the West, they fal with the Ilandes of the <HI>Philippinas</HI> which are many. The Ila~d of <HI>Mindanas</HI> which

is the firste of the South side: it beginneth in fiue degrees in the height of the North: and it lyeth out shewing it selfe in length as the rest do, which stande as a company of trees in the Northnorthwest course, vntil you come into xiii. degrees and a terce, where you meete with the Iland of <HI>Luzon.</HI> This Iland is in length out vnto the nynetiene degree in the same course, there is in it three places inhabited with <HI>Moores,</HI> they know not perfectly of what secte they are of, but they giue reuerence to <HI>Mahoma:</HI> they eate no porke. They haue many riuers wherein they gather golde: &amp; it is distant from this firme land of <HI>China</HI> lesse then one hundreth leages, and from the Cytie of <HI>Canton</HI> which falleth too the North part of it: one hundreth &amp; thirtie, &amp; little more. Our <HI>Spani|ards</HI> are in possession of the said Iland, and by rea|son the trade is greate from it too the firme land and for the curious things that are come fro~ thence to the new <HI>Spayne,</HI> and from thence too his maie|stie now they cal him <HI>China.</HI></P>
