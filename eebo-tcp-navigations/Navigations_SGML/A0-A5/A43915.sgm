<HEAD>THE EPISTLE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I</HI> Need not &s;ay much in the prai&s;e of this Book, but rather leave it to the cen&s;ure of the impartial Reader, who I doubt not will find &s;uch plea&s;ure in peru&s;ing it, that he will never think his time ill be&s;towed upon that occa&s;ion; for in it, as in a mirror, is plainly de|mon&s;trated all the follies of extravagant Youth, the vanity of a&s;piring greatne&s;s, the trouble, perplexity and hazards, that commonly attend upon Riches; as likewi&s;e the malice, &s;ubtilty and cunning devices of wicked men; together with the &s;nares that are layed by fal&s;e and di&s;|&s;embling Women to intrap the too too credulous Youths, and then to plunge them into an Ocean of mi&s;ery, which many times drives them upon the dangerous Rock of di&s;pair, or cau&s;es them to take bad cour&s;es to maintain that pride and gallantry from whence they are fallen, which in the end mo&s;t commonly brings them to &s;hame and di&s;grace: In it are likewi&s;e contained many cautions how to avoid danger, and to fore|&s;ee the &s;ame. It being compo&s;ed of large experience, partly Commical and partly Tragical: giving not only an account of the Life, &s;trange Adventures, and Death of the party from whom it takes its name, but likewi&s;e of &s;everal as well Kings and Princes as others. As al&s;o a de|&s;cription of many &s;trange Countries, with their manners, cu&s;tomes, and commodities: And to conclude, is &s;o delightful that none of this nature have excelled it; it being written as well for plea&s;ure as pro|fit.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the Parentage and Birth of <HI>Fortunatus.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_IN <HI>Famogo&s;ta</HI> a Famous City in the I&s;le of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> lived one <HI>Theodorus</HI> de&s;cended of Noble Patentage, who by the Decea&s;e of his Father, had a plentiful E|&s;tate fell into his hands; but he being of a haughty Mind, gave him&s;elf wholly up to the Plea&s;ures and Vanity of the World: He a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf with the Great Men of the Country, and lived riotou&s;ly, &s;pending his time for the mo&s;t part in Gaming, Hunting, Hawking, and Sumptuous
<PB N="2" REF="4"> Entertainments, the which in a &s;hort time greatly dimini&s;hed his E&s;tate; which his Friends perceiving, and being much grieved there|at, thought there was no better way to re&s;train his Licentious man|ner of Life, than by matching him to a Wife.</P>
<P>This being re&s;olved upon, and he not contradicting the Motion, they &s;ought for a fair, young and vertuous Lady throughout all the Citys of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and at la&s;t in <HI>Nicova</HI> found one that well-liked them, &s;he being Daughter to a Wealthy Merchant, and adorned with all the Perfections that appertain to Womankind, her Name being <HI>Gratiana:</HI> to this Lady by the Con&s;ent of her Father, <HI>The|odorus</HI> was &s;hortly married, and for a time lived in great Splen|dor, the fir&s;t Year having by her a fair Son, whom they named <HI>For|tunatus;</HI> but this little or nothing re&s;trained his Extravagancies: In&s;omuch that in a &s;hort time after the Marriage, notwith&s;tanding the large Portion he had with his Wife, he was brought to extream Poverty, which made him repent, though now too late; &s;o that often|times being hunger-pined, and in great want, he looking upon his Son (who by this time was a comely Youth) would &s;igh and let fall Tears, which &s;o afflicted the Young-man, that he one day de|manded the Cau&s;e, de&s;iring to know whether he had offended him in ought, the which if he had he would &s;trive to amend it: To whom the &s;orrowful Father replied, He had never offended him; but it was the exceeding Penury to which by his Extravagancies he was reduced to that maded as he &s;aw: To which the Youth replied, Let not that trouble you, for as for me, I have received &s;uch good Education un|der you, that I can &s;hift for my &s;elf in any place of the World; but he perceiving his Father &s;till troubled, and alwaies &s;igh when he looked upon him, he conjectured it was for his &s;ake, and therefore re&s;olved to be no longer chargeable to him: Whereupon one Day ta|king his Stick in his hand, he went to the Sea-&s;ide, where he had not &s;taied long, but a Ga&s;ly put to &s;hore, in which was the Earl of <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> who was returned from <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> they had not been long on &s;hore to refre&s;h them&s;elves, but the Earl cau&s;ed the Trumpet to &s;ound, to call his men back into the Galley; which <HI>Fortunatus</HI> per|ceiving, and being de&s;irous to Travel, went to the Earl and offer|ed him his Service: When the Earl perceiving him a goodly Youth,

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Fortunatus</HI> departed his Country, and how he became greatly e&s;teemed by the Earl.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AFter &s;ome Conte&s;ts with the Winds and Sea, the Galley &s;afe|ly arrived at <HI>Venice,</HI> where the Earl and his Men landed; and there by the help of <HI>Fortunatus</HI> (who among&s;t all his men could onely &s;peak the Language) he bought rich Iewels, and Gold Im|broderies, in order to his Marriage, he being to Wed the Duke of <HI>Cleves</HI> Daughter at his return, to whom he had been Contracted before his departure. By the&s;e and &s;uch other Services, <HI>Fortunatus</HI> gained the Love of his Lord; in&s;omuch that the re&s;t of the Servants began to envy him: A while after the Earl coming into his own Country, bought all his Servants Hor&s;es, and gave to <HI>Fortuna|tus</HI> the be&s;t next what him&s;elf rod on; &s;o that it greatly grieved the re&s;t of the Servants, who wi&s;hed the Devil had had the <HI>Italian</HI> before he came into their Lords Service. A while after the Marriage
<PB N="4" REF="5"> being Celebrated, a great number of Nobility being pre&s;ent, Tilts and Iu&s;ts were prepared, where after the Nobles had done great Feats, the Earl &s;et up two Iewels valued at a hundred pounds, for the Servants who &s;hould do be&s;t; upon which <HI>Fortunatus</HI> prepared his Hor&s;e, and &s;oon with his Lance overthrew one of them that run again&s;t him, whereupon he carried away the Prize; then one <HI>Ti|mothy</HI> having won the other Iewel, the Servants urged <HI>Timothy</HI> to Iu&s;t with <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> who &s;hould have them both; but in the Conflict <HI>Timothy</HI> was born down Hor&s;e and Man, &s;o that <HI>Fortuna|tus</HI>
<FIGURE>

</FIGURE> got not onely both the Iewels, but the great Applau&s;e of the Spectators, and the greater Favour of the Earl, who highly prai&s;ed him, telling them by what chance he had met with him: whereupon the Nobles and Ladies gave him many Pre&s;ents; this more and more rai&s;ed the Malice of his Fellow-&s;ervants again&s;t him; but when they well perceived that they could do nothing again&s;t him fairly, they wrought by &s;ubtilty: for there being among&s;t the re&s;t one <HI>Robert</HI> an ancient Servant to the Earl, who promi&s;ed for Ten Crowns to make <HI>Fortunatus</HI> run away; to this they gladly heark|ned, and every one paid his Dividend mo&s;t joyfully: when this was done, he in&s;inuates him&s;elf into the company of <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> ex|pre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="5" REF="5"> more than ordinary kindne&s;s, carrying him abroad to Treats, and other Meriments, without &s;uffering him to pay ought; this <HI>Fortunatus</HI> imagining to proceed from the intire good will he bore him, he gave the greater credit to all he &s;aid, not perceiving his &s;ubtilty: When the Money was almo&s;t &s;pent, and the Servants began to put <HI>Robert</HI> in mind of his Promi&s;e, he one day taking <HI>Fortunatus</HI> into a private Apartment, after &s;everal Di&s;|cour&s;es, he began to &s;igh and look &s;ad, which <HI>Fortunatus</HI> well no|ting, demanded the Cau&s;e, who told him it was for his &s;ake: then was he earne&s;t to know the Rea&s;on; truly &s;aid <HI>Robert</HI> it was told me by my &s;ingular good Friend, who upon a great Penalty enjoyned me Secrecy, but for the Love and good Will I bare to you, I &s;hall reveal it. Then thus our Lord intends to Morrow to Ride to <HI>Lau|&s;an,</HI> to wage Law again&s;t the Earl of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> where for the jea|lou&s;ie he had lately conceived of his Chamberlains, lea&s;t they &s;hould either have carnal Copulation with his beateous Wife, or any of her fair Ladies and Gentlewomen that attended her, he is re&s;olved to have them all Gelded, and though he entirely loves you above any of his Servants, yet he cannot &s;erve the re&s;t &s;o while you take part with them in the &s;ame, you being chief Chamberlain, and the mo&s;t comely among&s;t them, after which he will only reveal it ho his Lady, forbidding her to reveal it; but as the manner of Women is, it cannot be expected that &s;he will keep the Secret long; &s;o that it be|ing &s;pread abroad, it will redoun to your utter Di&s;grace, if the cut|ting do not hazard your Life: this I learned from him who is ap|pointed to Geld you, he telling it me (as thinking I might be one of the Chamberlains) in requital of &s;ome &s;ingular Favours I had done him.</P>
<P>When <HI>Fortunatus</HI> heard this he looked as pale as Death; and de|&s;ired <HI>Robert</HI> by all the Ties of Friend&s;hip, that he would be a&s;&s;i&s;ting to him in making his e&s;cape; for &s;aid he, I would not be Gelded if my Lord would give me his Earldom: When he talked of Flight, the Hypocrite <HI>Robert</HI> feigned him&s;elf &s;ad, and de&s;ired his &s;tay, the better to per&s;wade him into a Belief of what he had related, telling him he was &s;orry that ever he had Imparted it to him; but <HI>Fortu|natus</HI> &s;tanding as it were upon thorns, thought every hour ten, till
<PB N="6" REF="6"> he was gone; then <HI>Robert</HI> bid him in what place &s;oever he re&s;ided, &s;end him a Letter, that when the Earl was &s;upplied with Gelded-men, he might give notice to return: But <HI>Fortunatus</HI> replied, he would never return, though he endured never &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity or want. Vpon this <HI>Robert</HI> inwardly cejoyced, and helping him to a hor&s;e, he rod out of the City as if he went on hunting, and having pa&s;&s;ed the Gate, &s;et on full &s;peed and never looked behind him, till he thought him&s;elf out of Danger, and purcha&s;ing another hor&s;e, he &s;ent back the Earls, le&s;t upon that account he might be pur&s;ued.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>How the Earl grieved for the Departure of <HI>Fortunatus;</HI> and what befel him afterwards.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NO &s;ooner the flight of <HI>Fortunatus</HI> came to the Earls Ear, but he was exceeding &s;orry, mu&s;ing with him&s;elf what &s;hould be the Cau&s;e; but when he could think of none, he demanded of his Ser|vants if they were privy to the Occa&s;ion of his Departure, but they denied they knew ought: then he examined his Lady and her Gentle|women who were there at the &s;ame time, &s;aying, that the Evening be|fore he was very plea&s;ant, and had di&s;cour&s;ed to them about &s;everal Affairs of Women, and other things; at which the Earl marvelled the more, &s;aying, Although he could not then learn the true Cau&s;e of his Departing without taking leave of him, he doubted not but that he &s;hould find it out, and he would &s;everely puni&s;h the Occa|&s;ioner of it: This terrified <HI>Robert,</HI> &s;o that he grew very Melan|choly, le&s;t any of the Servants &s;hould betray him; and thereupon he took an Oath of Secrecy of them all, and when they were importu|nate to know by what means he had effected it, he told them a &s;tory of his Fathers Advancement by the King of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> quite contrary to what he had practi&s;ed. But to return to <HI>Fortunatus:</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fortunatus</HI> being on his way, made what &s;p&eacute;ed he could to <HI>Calice,</HI> where e&s;pying an <HI>Engli&s;h Ship,</HI> he bargained with the Ma&s;ter to Tran&s;port him into <HI>England,</HI> where arriving, he came to <HI>London,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="6"> where he hapned into the company of two young <HI>Cyprus</HI> Merchants, who were &s;ent over by their Fathers too, with a Ship laden with co&s;tly Wares, for which they had received great Sums of Money: And now <HI>Fortunatus</HI> being expert in the Manners and Cu&s;toms of mo&s;t Countries, became as it were their Tutor or In&s;tructor; &s;o that they &s;pent beyond mea&s;ure, Rioting it all the Day at Taverns, and at Night &s;porting it with Harlots, each one &s;triving to out-do the other in Exce&s;s; nor was <HI>Fortunatus</HI> wanting to &s;pend among&s;t them: but within a while all their Money being &s;pent, their Burom La&s;&s;es for&s;ook them, and all their Iollitry came to an end, which made the Merchants bethink them&s;elves of Returning home, which they did in the &s;ame Ship they came in, though with heavy hearts and empty Pur&s;es, leaving <HI>Fortunatus</HI> behind them.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Fortunatus</HI> became a Servant, and how one wicked <HI>An|drew</HI> by murdering a Gentleman in the hou&s;e of <HI>Fortunatus</HI>'s Ma&s;ter, brought the whole Family in great trouble.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>FOrtunatus</HI> being bare of Money and in a &s;trange Country, knew not well what cour&s;e to take; but at la&s;t re&s;olved to get over into <HI>France,</HI> but wanted Money to pay his Pa&s;&s;age; when gorng to a Harlot on whom he &s;pent the greate&s;t part of his money, he de&s;ired her to lend him two Crowns, telling her that he was to go over Sea to fetch Four hundred Crowns that his Vncle owed him; but &s;he would by no means lend him any, nor &s;carcely make him drink, but &s;ent him away with flouts: Then &s;eeing his former Folly, he wi&s;hed, (though too late) that he had kept his Money, and not have &s;pent it upon &s;uch an ungrateful Baggage; &s;o that not having Money to pay for his Pa&s;&s;age, he betook him&s;elf to the Service of one <HI>Jeroni|mus Roberti,</HI> a <HI>Florentine</HI> Merchant in <HI>Lombard-&s;treet,</HI> where he lived with great Credit, plea&s;ing his Ma&s;ter beyond mea&s;ure by his Diligence and towardne&s;s, and in a &s;hort time gained not onely the Love of his Mi&s;tris, but of all the Servants: In&s;omuch that his
<PB N="8" REF="7"> Ma&s;ter not onely intru&s;ted him with all his Ca&s;h, but employed him in his main Affairs; as taking in his Merchandize, and other things of &s;ecret and weighty Concernment, whereby he not onely advanta|ged him&s;elf, but al&s;o by his faithful Di&s;charge of the Tru&s;t com|mitted to him; he greatly advantaged his Ma&s;ter, in&s;omuch that he became dear to him; but he had not long continued in his Service, before an Extravagant <HI>Florentine</HI> came to his Ma&s;ter, who&s;e Name was <HI>Andrew,</HI> the Son of a very re&s;pon&s;ible Merchant, who had been fitted out with a Ship and all manner of Merchandize, the which he had &s;old and imbezled at a lavi&s;h Rate; and thereupon was driven to extream Poverty, which obliged him to live by his Wits; &s;o that bethinking him&s;elf, he counterfeited Bills of Exchange, and by that means &s;o drained his Father of what Monies he had, that in expe|ctation of what &s;hould be returned by Merchandize, he utterly Im|poveri&s;hed him; the which when he perceived, and that no more Mo|ney was to be had, he betook him&s;elf to Shifts, and being at <HI>Bruges,</HI> the place were he had &s;pent the greate&s;t part of his Money, he began to bethink him&s;elf that it was in vain for him to return, by rea&s;on of the great Injury he had done his Father, and then again con&s;idering that tho&s;e whom he had &s;pent his Monies upon, began to &s;light him, and that he could neither borrow any, nor be tru&s;ted for &s;uch conve|nient things as were appertaining to the Supply of Nature, he much condoled and bewailed his &s;ad Condition whereinto by rea&s;on of his Extravagancy he was fallen, and re&s;olved whatever bety'd him to return to his Father; when in his Travels homeward he came to the City of <HI>Turene</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> where by his Ho&s;t he under|&s;tood that a Merchant of <HI>London,</HI> upon a &s;piteful Accu&s;ation, lay in Irons in a dark Dungeon, and that he being very rich, would plen|tifully reward any One that would go over into <HI>England</HI> and &s;olicite his Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o that he might be delivered.

<P>The Gentleman being two days mi&s;&s;ing at Court, many began to wonder, and the third day acquainted the King thereof, who began to mi&s;tru&s;t: that the great value of his charge might have made him fal&s;e though otherwi&s;e, a Gentleman of undoubted Reputation and Fidelity; upon which a Me&s;&s;enger was &s;ent to his Hou&s;e to In|quire for him, and was informed by his Wife, that &s;he had not &s;een him in three days: but that at his departure he went in the Compa|ny of a <HI>Florentine,</HI> who pretended to have great &s;tore of Iewels at the Hou&s;e of one <HI>Jeronimus Roberti</HI> a <HI>Florentine,</HI> Merchant in <HI>Lom|bard-&s;treet,</HI> and that a while after their departure, the &s;ame per&s;on came with her Husbands Keys and Ring, de&s;iring her to &s;end the Iewels, but &s;he looking for them in his Cabinet, found them not there.</P>
<P>With this an&s;wer they returned to the King, who was greatly di&s;plea&s;ed, but that he might not &s;eem over ra&s;hly to cen&s;ure the Fide|lity of the Knight, although he concluded he was fled, he gave order that nothing more &s;hould be done in it till the end of two days, in which &s;pace <HI>Fortunatus</HI> returning from on Ship-board (where he had
<PB N="13" REF="9"> been taking an account of the ladeing) perceived not only his Ma&s;ter, but all his fellow Servants very melancholly; upon which, he de|manded of the Maid what was the cau&s;e of &s;uch their &s;uddain alterati|on, to whom &s;he an&s;wered (as having before-hand premeditated an ex|cu&s;e) that her Ma&s;ter had received a Letter of the Death of a dear Friend of his, which had occa&s;ioned that &s;adne&s;s in him; and that with him the re&s;t Simpathized as is the Cu&s;tom of their Country, but that he not being his near Relation, he would not go into Mourn|ing for him, with which <HI>Fortunatus</HI> was well plea&s;ed. But now the two days being expired, and no tidings of the Gentleman; the King in a great rage &s;ent his Pur&s;evants to &s;earch his Hou&s;e, who broke o|pen as many Trunks, Che&s;ts and Cabinets, as they found locked, in it found not the Iewels: upon which, at the Supplication of the Gentlewoman (who &s;aid &s;he verily believed her Husband was Mur|thered) they went to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Jeronimus,</HI> where having the Kings Warrant, they apprehended him and all his Family upon Su&s;picion of Murther, but they all denied it, &s;aying: Indeed there was &s;uch a man there, but that he departed thence in the Company of the Per&s;on who brought him thither, and that &s;ince they &s;aw him not: but this excu&s;e availed not, for they all (being nine in number, of which <HI>Fortunatus</HI> was one) were delivered to the Sheriffs, who carryed them to <HI>Newgate,</HI> where they were kept a&s;under, and were &s;trictly examined, but they all declared as before: as for <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> he was ignorant of the matter and therefore could not confe&s;s, upon which the Sheriffs were ordered to &s;earch <HI>Jeronimus</HI>'s Hou&s;e, the which they accordingly did, and looked in all the Che&s;ts, Trunks, Clo&s;ets, Cellers, Pantries and Stables, but found not the dead Bo|dy, and &s;o were about to depart, when one among&s;t the re&s;t having a Torch in his hand, lighted &s;ome Paper and threw it down into the Privy, whereby rea&s;on of the &s;hallowne&s;s of the Ordure, the Legs of the party Murthered appeared, he being ca&s;t in with his Head down|ward, which he no &s;ooner perceived by the Light, but he called to the re&s;t, telling them that he had found the Murthered Corps, and there|upon they all coming together drew it out, and after having clean&s;ed it with Water, they layed it in the Street before the Door of <HI>Jeroni|mus,</HI> for to be &s;een of all People, who with great Dete&s;tation and &s;ha|king

<P>NOtwith&s;tanding they made their Confe&s;&s;ion, how and upon what ca&s;ion the Murther was Committed, it availed them nothing; for the King i&s;&s;ued out a Commi&s;&s;ion to try them, where cheir own Confe&s;&s;ions and the finding of the Murthered Corps in the Hou&s;e being proved again&s;t them they were found Guilty, and being Con|demned, were &s;hortly carried to the Place of Execution; a pair of<FIGURE>

At the hearing of this, the People prevailed &s;o far with the Sheriff, as to &s;tay till the King might be Advertized of what had been related; who upon the hearing thereof, and at the earne&s;t Suit of &s;ome Ladys (who had ca&s;t their Eyes upon <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> and &s;eeing him a goodly Youth, were moved to pitty him) the King &s;ent his Mandate to the Sheriff to &s;ave his Life; who thereupon, after he had fa&s;tned the re&s;t in Chains to the Gallows, brought back <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> and in a while after &s;et him at Liberty.</P>

<PB N="20" REF="13"> hearken to the giving him his Daughter, although the Maid could have been well content to have loved him for his Per&s;on, but being charged by her Father upon his Ble&s;&s;ing and the Ties of her Obe|dience, not to permit his farther Addre&s;&s;es, &s;he not onely gave him his An&s;wer at his next coming, but al&s;o would not from that time forward admit him to &s;ee her, unle&s;s by accident he met her in the Street, and then as much as in her lay &s;he would &s;hun him, which made him turn his former Love into Hatred, and the &s;tuddy of Re|venge; in&s;omuch that within awhile after, he having certain notice by &s;ome of her Servants (whom he bribed to &s;end him word how things went from time to time) that within two daies &s;he was to be Married to a Knights elde&s;t Son, who lived at a Village about four Miles from the City: He being moved by the In&s;tigation of the Devil, re&s;olved to hinder the Match whatever it co&s;t him, and thereupon he di&s;clo&s;ed his Mind to one <HI>Saggue</HI> a bloody Villain, and one with whom he often kept company; who advi&s;ed him, that &s;ince the Gentlewoman had proved fal&s;e to him in breaking her Promi&s;e, and now was re&s;olved by marrying another to fru&s;trate all his hopes, it was but ju&s;t that &s;ince he could not enjoy her him&s;elf, to hinder any other from doing the &s;ame; for &s;aies he, It will &s;urely grieve you to think what plea&s;ure your Rival enjoyes, whil&s;t you &s;uffer pain and torment; nay more, to think how they will flout and jeer you at their Merry-makings, and often laugh you to &s;corn for being &s;o fooli&s;h to beflow upon her &s;uch liberal Gifts, and all to no purpo&s;e; nay, and that your Rival &s;hould have them at his di&s;po&s;e.</P>
<P>This &s;o inflamed <HI>Montpe&s;s,</HI> that he could afterwards talk of nothing but Revenge, and thereupon &s;ecretly agreed with this bloody Varlet for 200 hundred Crowns to make her away, either by &s;tab|bing, poy&s;oning, drowning, or &s;trangling; &s;o that being furni&s;hed with fit In&s;truments of Death, <HI>Saggue</HI> went to wait about her Lodging for a fit Opportunity, but finding &s;he came not out, he got on a Serving-mans Habit, and having written a Letter in the Name of the Knights Son to whom &s;he was &s;uddenly to be married, he came in the dark of the Evening and knocked at the Door, which the Maid opening, demanded his Bu&s;ine&s;s, who told her that he came from &s;uch a Gentleman with a Letter, and &s;ome rich Pre&s;ents
<PB N="21" REF="13"> which he had order to deliver to none but her Ma&s;ters Daughter; upon which the Wench went up and acquainted her what the Me&s;|&s;enger had &s;aid: So that the innocent Lady not dreaming her end was &s;o nigh, came down, and taking him a&s;ide into her withdrawing Room, ordred the Maid to bring a Gla&s;s of Wine, the which after &s;he had &s;et down, &s;he withdrew, as thinking they might have &s;ome private talk which was not fitting for her to hear; when the Maid was gone, he told the Gentlewoman a very formal Story, and then gave her the Letter which &s;he having opened, began to read; whil&s;t he was feeling in his Pockets, as if he had the Pre&s;ents there that were &s;pecified in the Letter: But in&s;tead of Pre&s;ents, he drew out a Knife &s;ecretly, and perceiving the Coa&s;t clear, whil&s;t &s;he was reading, he with full force &s;truck it to the Haft in her Brea&s;t, upon which gi|ving a &s;hriek &s;he fell down down dead, which the Murtherer percei|ving, he ha&s;ted thence, but had &s;carcely pa&s;&s;ed the outward Gate, when the Father of the Dam&s;el coming by, e&s;pied her weltring in her Gore, at which he rai&s;ed &s;uch a doleful Exclamation, as Alarm'd all the Hou&s;e; whereupon pur&s;uit was immediately made after the

<P>How <HI>Fortunatus</HI> travelling through a Fore&s;t, was met by Dame <HI>Fortune,</HI> and how &s;he gave him a Pur&s;e that continually &s;up|plied his Expences.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>FOrtunatus</HI> being got out of the City of <HI>Orleance,</HI> took his way towards <HI>Paris,</HI> when travelling through a huge Fore&s;t, he on his right-hand perceived a beautiful Creature in female Habit, &s;itting under a broad &s;preading Beech-tree with a Vail over her Eyes, who as he came near, aro&s;e and cro&s;&s;ed him in his way, at which he rejoy|ced not a little, for he had thought there had been nought but Bears and wild Bea&s;ts in the place, but looking &s;tedfa&s;tly upon her he began to ponder whether &s;he might not be a Fary, or bodily &s;hape compo&s;ed by Delu&s;ion: But whil&s;t he was in this doubt, &s;he taking him by the Hand, gently asked him whether he was going, upon which he
<PB N="24" REF="15"> told her, de&s;ireing her that &s;he would accompany him out of the Wood.</P>
<P>To which &s;he replied, &s;he might not go with him, but that &s;he would do more for him than any on earth had ever done: Where|upon <HI>Fortunatus</HI> gave her many thanks, and de&s;ired to know her Name, and what &s;he was, and her Bu&s;ine&s;s, in &s;o de&s;art a place; to whom &s;he an&s;wered, my Name is <HI>Fortune,</HI> and here I am placed by him who made all things, and therefore has power to di&s;po&s;e of them as it be&s;t plea&s;eth him: by his Commi&s;&s;ion I am here placed, to di&s;tribute Six things, according as the Influence of the Stars by his appointment does direct: the which are the&s;e; <HI>Wi&s;dom, Health, long Life, Beauty, Strength,</HI> and <HI>Riches:</HI> and now is the Moment of Choice, therefore make no delay, for in this ca&s;e the Op|portunity being over-&s;lipped, returns not again in an Age: Be free, and take for asking any of the&s;e which &s;hall &s;eem mo&s;t plea&s;ing to you.</P>

<PB N="25" REF="15"> &s;oever you &s;hall hereafter be, when at any time you &s;hall put your hand into the &s;ame, you &s;hall find 10 Pieces of Gold of the currant Coyn of that Nation where you are, and &s;o it &s;hall continue to do during your life, and the life of your Sons, but no longer, This more and more rejoyced <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> in&s;omuch that he returned her a thou&s;and Thanks, wherefore &s;he rebuked him, &s;aying, That he ought not to thank her for what he had received, but God Almighty, from who&s;e liberal Bounty to the Sons of Men all good things flow, as for me, &s;aid &s;he, I am but the Dealer of good Things, and that I do by chance, for I neither &s;ee nor have regard to the per&s;ons on whom I be&s;tow them, but am always hoodwink'd as you now behold me; therefore had <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> been your Portion, &s;he would have taught you far otherwi&s;e, even to have rendred thanks where they are mo&s;t ju&s;tly due; yet what thou ha&s;t &s;o freely received, be&s;tow part upon the Poor as thou &s;halt &s;ee occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>This &s;aid, <HI>Fortunatus</HI> bowed low, and promi&s;ed to perform all &s;he had commanded him: And as for this Day I will yearly keep it Sa|cred, and Liberally be&s;tow Alms; nay, I will moreover be&s;tow a large Portion on &s;ome unmarried Virgin, in order to her being di&s;|po&s;ed of in Marriage: Then he de&s;ired her to lead him out of the Wood, which &s;he promi&s;ed, and thereupon ordred him to follow her; when as &s;he led him into a great Road, and willed him to go &s;traight forwards, neither turning to the right or the left, nor &s;o much as to look back to &s;ee what was become of her; whenas &s;he no &s;ooner part|ed from him, but &s;he vani&s;hed: Then <HI>Fortunatus</HI> travelling about three hours, came to the end of the Wood, where lifting up his eyes, he beheld a fair Hou&s;e, and being de&s;irous to refre&s;h him&s;elf there, for he perceived it was an Inn, he put his hand into his Pur&s;e, to try if what had been related, were true, and thereupon pulled out 10 Pieces of Gold, at which he greatly rejoyced and entring the Inn, called for Meat and Drink of the be&s;t; and by rea&s;on the Ho&s;t began to mi&s;teu&s;t him, as being mean in Apparel, he pulled out two Crowns and gave him them before-hand, whereupon the Ho&s;t joyfully &s;pread the Table with &s;uch choice Provi&s;ion as the Hou&s;e would affoard.</P>

<P>How <HI>Fortunatus</HI> at his Departure from the Inn, bought three fair Hor&s;es which Earl <HI>Rodolphus</HI> had before cheapned, for which he was Impri&s;oned, and narrowly e&s;caped his life.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHen <HI>Fortunatus</HI> had fufficiently taken his Repa&s;t, and there|with greatly refre&s;hed him&s;elf after three days continuance in the Inn, he perceived in the Stable exceeding rich Trappins, with all manner of Furniture for a Hor&s;eman, and demanded of his Ho&s;t to what or who&s;e Hor&s;e they did belong, to none &s;ays the Ho&s;t, for they are left here to be &s;old; then &s;aid <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> what is the Price of them; 50 Crowns &s;aid the Ho&s;t, Here is your Money &s;aid <HI>Fortunatus;</HI> and &s;o taking them, he departed; when travelling forwards &s;ome di|&s;tance thence, he e&s;pyed a great Village with a Ca&s;tle in it, &s;tanding upon a Hill, and thither he repaired with all &s;peed, as hoping there to light of a good Hor&s;e, the which in his former Inn he could not do; when he came thither, he asked for the be&s;t Inn in the Town, and being directed to it, he &s;at him down, and ca&s;ted for Provi&s;ion, which his Ho&s;t brought him, then falling into di&s;cour&s;e, he asked him, whe|ther he knew not of any good Hor&s;es that were to be &s;old thereabouts, to which the Ho&s;t replyed, that there were three exceeding fair Hor&s;es which had been lately brought to that Town by a Merchant, intend|ing to di&s;po&s;e of them at the Entertainment that was to be made by the Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> upon the account of his Wedding with the fair <HI>I&s;&s;abella,</HI> Daughter to the King of <HI>Arragon;</HI> then was <HI>Fortu|natus</HI> de&s;irous to &s;ee them, but the Ho&s;t told him that the Earl <HI>Ro|dolphus</HI> had bidden 300 Crowns for them, and that the Merchant refu&s;ed to take under 300 Crowns; no matter for the Price, &s;aid <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> if &s;o I but like them; and thereupon he de&s;ired his Ho&s;t to go with him to the place where they were, which he did, and &s;miled as he went, to think how he &s;hould lo&s;e his labour, for he did not imagine <HI>Fortunatus</HI> had Money to purcha&s;e them; but coming to the Merchant after having well view'd them, <HI>Fortunatus</HI> drew out the Money, and payed it down, and had the Hor&s;es delivered to him,

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Earl having notice of all that had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ent immediately to apprehend <HI>Fortunatus</HI> in his Inn, who then by the Coun&s;el of his Ho&s;t, was preparing to depart; but having &s;eized <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">im, they brought him before their Lord, who after many reproachful words, demanded whence he was. and how he came by &s;o much Money, as to buy &s;uch high priz'd Hor&s;es out of his hands: As to the Fir&s;t, he an&s;wered, That he was the Son of a poor Courtier of the City of <HI>Famago&s;ta</HI> in the I&s;le of <HI>Cyprus:</HI> As to the &s;econd, he &s;aid, What
<PB N="28" REF="17"> Money he had, he came hone&s;tly by it, and therefore ought not to be que&s;tioned about it, unle&s;s any could prove to the contrary; adding, that he never yet wronged any body of one Farthing: But the Earl angerly told him, that it was not likely &s;uch a Fellow as he &s;hould have &s;o much Money, unle&s;s he had robbed or murthered &s;ome per&s;on for it; and thereupon ordred him to be fa&s;tned to the Rack, in order to force him to a Confe&s;&s;ion; yet he re&s;olved rather to &s;uffer the wor&s;t Extremity, than to confe&s;s the &s;ecret Vertue of his fortunate Pur&s;e; but being put to exceeding Torture, he de&s;ired them to take him from off the Rack, and he would confe&s;s; the which they did, and brought him before the Earl from out the Pri&s;on, where when he had fir&s;t begged Mercy, he &s;aid, As I Ye&s;terday was travelling in a Fore&s;t, &s;o chanced, that I found a Pur&s;e with 620 Crowns in it: In what Fore&s;t, &s;aid the Earl? A Fore&s;t about four Miles from this place; Why you Varlet, then &s;aid the Earl with a &s;tern Countenance, will you rob me of my Right? for know, that I am Lord of the Fore&s;t, it and that whatever is found there, appertains to me: I knew not that &s;aid <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> and therefore humbly crave your pardon; but &s;aid the Earl, you &s;hall be made to know it e're you depart, and there|fore fir&s;t tell me what is become of the Pur&s;e and Money? As for the Pur&s;e, replyed <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> I took the Money out of it, and threw it into a Brook that runs through the Fore&s;t; but if it &s;hould plea&s;e your Honour to take the re&s;t of the Money, here it is: That &s;hall not &s;erve, &s;aid the Earl, for I will not onely take your Money, but your Life; and therefore again&s;t to Morrow prepare for your Execution.</P>
<P>This made <HI>Fortunatus</HI> exceeding &s;ad, and began to wi&s;h that he had cho&s;en wi&s;dom in&s;tead of riches, by which he ea&s;ily might have e&s;caped &s;uch troubles, but &s;eeing that power and tyranny would have its way, fell upon his Knees, and with tears be&s;ought the Earl to &s;pare his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ife, and take both the Hor&s;es and the Mony; for, &s;aid he, what will it avail you to take away my Life that am &s;uch a mi&s;erable Creature? but if you &s;pare me, I &s;hall ever extole your Clemency and Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>This and the intreaty of the Earls Servants, but e&s;pecially the Counte&s;&s;es Gentlewomen, moved him to relent, &s;o that having taken
<PB N="29" REF="17"> an Oath of him never to di&s;cover what had pa&s;&s;ed, he gave him two Crowns back, and &s;ent his &s;ervants to &s;ee him out of Town, where they left him; at which <HI>Fortunatus</HI> did not a little rejoyce, fora&s;|much as he had his dear Companion the Pur&s;e to bear him company, then having abjured ever coming within that Earls Iuri&s;diction any more, he departed towards <HI>Brittain;</HI> and after &s;ome time, came to <HI>Angiers,</HI> a con&s;iderable City of that Dukedom, where at that time was held a great Fea&s;t, in Honour of the Marriage of the Dukes Daughter with the Prince of <HI>Saxony;</HI> upon which occa&s;ion a great number of Lords and others, were come thither gallantly attended: upon which, <HI>Fortunatus</HI> notwith&s;tanding his late bad &s;ucce&s;s by deal|ing in hor&s;e fle&s;h, bought three more hor&s;es and put him&s;elf in a &s;plen|did Equipage, and likewi&s;e hired two &s;ervants, and betook him&s;elf to the be&s;t Inn, where he kept company and conver&s;ed with the be&s;t, and &s;o continued in great &s;plendor till the Celebration of the Marriage.</P>

<P>How an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Gentleman was entertained by <HI>Fortunatus</HI> as his Companion, and what befell them in their Travels.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHil&s;t <HI>Fortunatus</HI> continued at this City, he &s;pent mo&s;t part of his time in &s;eeing the pa&s;times which were made as Pomp|ous Shows, Ma&s;ques, Dauncing, Tilt, Turnament, and many other Noble Exerci&s;es; and &s;o being u&s;ed every day to depart from the Inn with his men, the Ho&s;t began at la&s;t to mi&s;tru&s;t he would give him the &s;lip as &s;ome others had done, and thereupon acquainted him with his thought, at which <HI>Fortunatus</HI> &s;miling, put his hand into his Pur&s;e, and pulled out a hundred Crowns, the which he gave to the Ho&s;t: &s;aying, here hone&s;t fellow take this, and when thou thinke&s;t we have had as much as it comes to ask for more, I &s;hall not be very inqui&s;itive to know the account.</P>
<P>At this the Ho&s;t began to look very plea&s;ant ever after, &s;hewing great re&s;pect to <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> &s;etting him at the upper end of the

<P>Not long after, as he was &s;itting at dinner with &s;ix Earls and ten Lords, be&s;ides other Gentlemen of good fa&s;hion; &s;everal Mu&s;itianers came and offered to play before them, telling them that they had been Gentlemen, but where now fallen to decay, and were forced to take up that employ for their living; when they had played a good while, an Earl at the Table asked one of them that was more likely than the re&s;t, what Countryman he was? who replyed that he was an <HI>Iri&s;h|man,</HI> and had &s;pent all his E&s;tate in traveling; for, &s;aid he, I have been in mo&s;t parts of the World, and can name, and have &s;een mo&s;t of the Emperors, Kings, and Soveraign Princes in <HI>Europe, A&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Africa;</HI> and can di&s;cribe the Splendor of their Courts, the manners and cu&s;toms of their Countrys, and &s;peak mo&s;t Languages, with many other things.</P>
<P>Then they asked him his name, who told them he was called <HI>Leo|paldus,</HI> and came of a wor&s;hipful Family, which appeared no le&s;s in his Carriage and portly Demeanour; upon which the Nobility and Gentry being moved to Compa&s;&s;ion, that &s;o goodly a per&s;on &s;hould be reduced to poverty, they liberally di&s;tributed Money among&s;t him and his Companions, and de&s;ired him to &s;tay and attend them whil&s;t the Fea&s;t continued; for which, not onely he, but the re&s;t returned their Honours a thou&s;and thanks: Then one of the Earls asked him if he would be willing to live with him, and become a Tutor, and he &s;hould never want; but he excu&s;ed it, &s;aying, He had left a Wife and Children in his own Country, which he much longed to &s;ee.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Fortunatus</HI> who had curiou&s;ly obferved the Man, began to think with him&s;elf, could I but procure him for my Companion in Travel, I &s;hould think my &s;elf happy; and thereupon when Din|ner was ended, he &s;ent privately for him to come to his Chamber, where when he entred, <HI>Fortunatus</HI> Saluted him after the mo&s;t cour|teous manner, and told him that he was minded to &s;pend the re&s;idue of his Days in Travel, and that if he would become his Companion, he would &s;o provide for him, that he &s;hould ever have plenty; as likewi&s;e provide a Hor&s;e for him&s;elf, and another for a man who &s;hould wait on him.</P>
<PB N="31" REF="18">
<P>To this <HI>Leopaldus</HI> replyed, That he could be well content with &s;uch a Proffer, if it were not that he &s;o much longed to &s;ee his Wife and Children, which had been the occa&s;ion of his return out of far Countries; to which <HI>Fortunatus</HI> an&s;wered him, That if he would make him a &s;olemn promi&s;e, that he would afterwards accompany him, he would go with him into <HI>Ireland</HI> fir&s;t, and bear his Charges thither, and then we will return to <HI>Cyprus</HI> the I&s;le wherein I was born, and &s;o from thence by Sea and Land, travel into other Coun|tries and Kingdoms as thou &s;halt think be&s;t fit.</P>
<P>At this <HI>Leopaldus</HI> inwardly rejoyced; but having known the ex|ceeding Expence of Travel, had thought with him&s;elf that <HI>Fortu|natus</HI> could never be able to perform what he promi&s;ed; and there|upon told him, unle&s;s he had great Sums of Money, it was in vain to undertake what he propo&s;ed: Let me alone for that, &s;aid <HI>Fortu|natus,</HI> for I &s;hall have Money in all places where I come; If it be &s;o, &s;aid <HI>Leopaldus,</HI> and thou wilt perform thy promi&s;e, I am con|tent; and thereupon <HI>Leopaldus</HI> having a Hor&s;e provided for him, and another for his Man, which <HI>Fortunatus</HI> cau&s;ed to be hired: af|ter the Ho&s;t was di&s;charged, they departed the City, and &s;o vi&s;iting many fair Cities and Towns, at la&s;t they came to <HI>Bruges</HI> in <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> where taking Shipping they came for <HI>London,</HI> where having &s;tayed awhile, they departed for <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;till vi&s;iting all Places of note as they pa&s;&s;ed; and from <HI>Scotland</HI> they Sailed over Sea into <HI>Ireland,</HI> where coming to <HI>Londonderry,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Wal|drink,</HI> where was his own Hou&s;e, he was not known, by rea&s;on of the Alteration his long Ab&s;ence had made; but finding his Wife and Children all in good Health, he by many Tokens made them un|der&s;tand who he was, to their no &s;mall Ioy; the next day came thi|ther <HI>Fortunatus</HI> and his Men, who perceiving that <HI>Leopoldus</HI> was but &s;lenderly provided, gave him a 100 Crowns, bidding him go and buy &s;uch Provi&s;ion as was convenient, and Invite the chief of his Neigbours to Dinner, the which he did, and very &s;plendedly En|tertained them.</P>
<P>When <HI>Fortunatus</HI> had &s;tayed there about a Month, he was de&s;i|rous to be gone, and acquainted <HI>Leopoldus</HI> with the &s;ame, giving him 2000 Crowns to leave with his Wife and Children, and &s;o af|ter
<PB N="32" REF="19"> Leave taken, and &s;ome Tears &s;hed at parting, <HI>Leopoldus</HI> went with <HI>Fortunatus;</HI> and as they journied, he told him of S. <HI>Patrick</HI>'s Purgatory which was in their way &s;ome Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Wal|drink:</HI> this made <HI>Fortunatus</HI> de&s;irous to &s;ee; in&s;omuch that when they came to the Abbey, <HI>Leopoldus</HI> went to the Abbot, and told him that a &s;trange Lord was arrived there, and was very de&s;irous to &s;ee S. <HI>Patrick</HI>'s Purgatory, to which he con&s;ented, provided the Fees were payd to tho&s;e that kept it: which <HI>Fortunatus</HI> not onely did, but likewi&s;e pre&s;ented the Abbot with a Cask of the be&s;t Wine that could be got in the Town of <HI>Yernecks</HI> where the Abby &s;tood: So that in requital the Abbot Invited him and <HI>Leopoldus</HI> to Dinner, and at their reque&s;t told them, that the Town wherein the Abby &s;tood was once a wild De&s;art or Wilderne&s;s, and that one <HI>Patrick</HI> a Devout man, was wont to leave his Mona&s;tery and re&s;ort thither to Pray|ers: When one day finding a large Hole in the Ground, over-grown with Bu&s;hes, he enter'd therein, and finding the In&s;ide more large and &s;pacious, all arched over with Pumice, and &s;upported with Pil|lars of Earth; he ventured yet further, when &s;triking into a wind|ing Path, he lo&s;t his way and could not get out again, but was a&s;|&s;aulted<FIGURE>

<P>This made <HI>Fortunatus</HI> the more de&s;irous to &s;ee it, and re&s;ting that Night, he got up the next Morning, and having &s;hrieved him|&s;elf, and &s;ayd his Prayers devoutly, he, together with <HI>Leopoldus</HI> who offered to accompany him, went into a Hole behind the Altar, to which there was a Door, and a pair of Stairs of earth; when they were in, the Monks &s;hut the Door after them, and prayed for their happy return as they u&s;ed to do for others that had gone in before them, and withal admoni&s;hed them not to venture too far, le&s;t they were lo&s;t, as many Pilgrims had been, who were not found again in three or four days.</P>
<P><HI>Fortunatus</HI> and <HI>Leopoldus</HI> being in, went forwards about a 100 paces, and coming into a narrow pa&s;&s;age that they could go but one a brea&s;t, they turned &s;o often, that they at la&s;t were lo&s;t in the Labyrinth, not knowing when they went backwards or when for|wards, &s;o that they continued wandring too and fro for the &s;pace of two days, hearing loud Shrieks and Groans, and now and then felt hot Fla&s;hes, which &s;o amazed them, that they wi&s;hed they had ne|ver ventured in; and be&s;ides Hunger began to a&s;&s;ault them very grievou&s;ly, in&s;omuch that <HI>Fortunatus</HI> began to &s;ay, that now his Pur&s;e was u&s;ele&s;s, and that notwith&s;tanding he had Gold and Sil|ver, yet that would not &s;atisfie Nature, but that they mu&s;t now &s;tarve with Hunger; and thereupon they both fell upon their Knees, and made a Vow, that if God would be plea&s;ed to deliver them this once, they would never be &s;o ra&s;hly venturous again.</P>
<P>Now the third Day came, and the Servants without being very impatient of their Ma&s;ters &s;tay, called at the Mouth of the Hole, and held in lighted Torches, but in vain; when as not only they, but the Abbot and Prie&s;ts were in great perplexity, as thinking <HI>Fortu|natus</HI> and <HI>Leopoldus</HI> were either lo&s;t or dead; in&s;omuch that they began to fing Ma&s;s for their Souls, whenas the Abbot calling an old man to mind who had mea&s;ured the Hole with Ropes, he &s;ent for him, and willed him to go in and &s;eek for two Gentlemen that had
<PB N="34" REF="20"> lo&s;t them&s;elve&s;t therein; the which upon the Servants promi&s;e, that their Ma&s;ters &s;hould give him a 100 Crowns, he undertook; &s;ay|ing, if they were alive he would bring them thence: Whereupon ta|king with him a lighted Torch, and a Pipe, he entred; but that Torch &s;oon went out, yet he pa&s;&s;ed on playing upon his Pipe; and after having gone a thou&s;and paces, began to hollow to them, who with faint Voices an&s;wered, till at la&s;t he being directed by the Sound. came to them, and informed them that he was come to fetch them out; and taking them by the hand, bid them follow him, which they did with no &s;mall content; when they came out, they were exceeding feeble, yet greatly rejoyced at their Deliverance: So that when <HI>Fortunatus</HI> his men told him how they had agreed with the old man for a 100 Crowns, he gave him 200, and then ordain|ing a &s;umptuous Dinner, he Invited the Abbot and the re&s;t, and de&s;ired them to return God thanks for the great Deliverance he had &s;ent them, giving 200 Crowns among&s;t the Prie&s;ts, and after leave taken, departed; and taking Ship, &s;et Sail for <HI>Calice,</HI> and from thence went to <HI>Paris,</HI> and &s;o over-land to <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;eeing ma|ny Countries, and &s;trange things in their way.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Fortunatus</HI> Travelled from <HI>Rome</HI> to <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and what befell him at the Coronation of the Emperor.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>FOrtunatus</HI> and <HI>Leopoldus</HI> having continued at <HI>Rome</HI> &s;ome time, to take notice of the Splendor and Pomp of the Bi&s;hops Court, departed thence for <HI>Venice;</HI> whereupon News had, that the Emperor of <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> intended to Crown his Son Em|peror, by rea&s;on he was &s;o old that he could not Weild the Govern|ment as he ought,; the State of <HI>Venice</HI> re&s;olved to &s;end an Am|ba&s;&s;ador with &s;everal Pre&s;ents to congratulate his E&s;tabli&s;hment in the Empire: And now the Gallies being ready, <HI>Fortunatus</HI> &s;o or|dred the matter with the Captain of one of them, that he got leave for him and his Retinue to pa&s;s to <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> therein; when
<PB N="35" REF="20"> after ten days Sail they came within &s;ight of the City, and were met by &s;ome of the Emperors Gallies who were &s;ent to welcom them; and coming on &s;hore, the Ambo&s;&s;ador had a &s;tately Hou&s;e pro|vided him; but as for <HI>Fortunatus, Leopoldus,</HI> and their Men, they were forced to betake them&s;elves to an Inn, which proved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">one of the be&s;t; for the Ho&s;t was a Thief, and u&s;ually watched his opportu|nity to rob his Gue&s;ts when they were &s;leeping, who dreamed of no &s;uch matter; &s;o that the Ho&s;t perceiving <HI>Fortunatus</HI> to have great &s;tore of Money, he re&s;olved to make bold with &s;ome of it; and there|fore in their ab&s;ence got into their Chamber through a private Door, and &s;earched all about, but found no Money; &s;o that he concluded they carried it all about them, and &s;o re&s;olved when they payd again, to watch where they put it.</P>
<P>A while after <HI>Fortunatus</HI> came to pay, and putting his hand under the Table, pulled out Money, and gave it to <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">poldus</HI> to pay the Reckoning, that it might not be perceived from whence he had it; &s;o that the Ho&s;t marking him well, &s;uppo&s;ed it was hidden in his Cloaths, and was re&s;olved the next Night to put in with him for a &s;nack: Now <HI>Fortunatus</HI> in the mid&s;t of his Merriments remem|bred the time was come wherein he was to perform his Vow made to <HI>Dame Fortune,</HI> about be&s;towing <HI>400</HI> Crowns on a Virgin in Marriage; and thereupon he called his Ho&s;t, and asked him if he knew any hone&s;t man that had a fair Daughter to be&s;tow, and he would give her a Portion: the Ho&s;t told him that a Neighbor of his had one who was marrigable; upon which <HI>Fortunatus</HI> bid the Ho&s;t go to her Parents, and bid them bring her the next Morning; which the Ho&s;t neglected to do, &s;aying, She was gone abroad, and would not return till late the next Morrow-evening: the which he did, be|cau&s;e they &s;hould not part with their Money till he had put in for a &s;hare; &s;o that when they were in Bed, and &s;leeping &s;oundly by rea|&s;on they were tired the day before at the noble Pa&s;times that were held in the City; about Midnight the Ho&s;t came through his private Door; and fir&s;t coming to <HI>Leopoldus,</HI> he felt and &s;oon found his Pur&s;e, and took from thence <HI>50</HI> Duckets; then coming to <HI>Fortu|natus,</HI> he felt his Pur&s;e likewi&s;e, but not putting his hand into it, he could not perceive any Money; for &s;uch was the Secret, that to
<PB N="36" REF="21"> all tho&s;e that felt the out-&s;ide, it felt empty; whereupon the Ho&s;t ha|ving cut it from off his Girdle, threw it under the Bed; and &s;o &s;et|ting open all the Doors and Windows departed: when about the third Watch <HI>Leopoldus</HI> awaked, and e&s;pying all the Windows open, called to his Servants, as likewi&s;e to <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> fearing what had hapned; when the Servants were awakened, he chid them ex|treamly for leaving open the Doors and Windows; but they &s;toutly affirmed, that they &s;hut them fa&s;t when they went to Bed: upon which <HI>Leopoldus</HI> feeling for his Pur&s;e, found it gone; and cal|ling to <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> told him that he was robbed; <HI>Fortunatus</HI> &s;tarting up between &s;leep and wake, found his Pur&s;e gone al&s;o; and thereupon he fell into &s;uch extream &s;orrow, that he &s;woonded away, which cau&s;ed no &s;mall &s;tir among&s;t the Servants; &s;o that the Ho&s;t who all this while &s;tood li&s;tning, came in, and angerly demanded why they made &s;uch ado to trouble the whole Hou&s;e? Whereupon they told him they were robbed; to which he replyed, Like enough &s;o, perhaps you have Thieves among&s;t your &s;elves, and have robbed one another: But when he beheld <HI>Fortunatus</HI> in that condition, he al&s;o affi&s;ted to bring him to him&s;elf again, telling them that they ought to have looked to their Doors and Windows at a time when &s;o ma|ny Thieves were abroad.</P>
<P>When <HI>Fortunatus</HI> came to him&s;elf, he was exceeding &s;orrowful; upon which the Ho&s;t asked him, how much Money he had lo&s;t? Who replyed, not much; but that he had lo&s;t a Pur&s;e with a Bill of Ex|change in it worth <HI>1000</HI> Crowns, though it would do them little or no good that had it; for they could not receive the Money unle&s;s he gave his di&s;charge. Now the Ho&s;t that knew where the Pur&s;e was become, bid him &s;earch about; for, &s;aid he, it may be thrown &s;ome|where in the Room, for few Thieves care for an empty Pur&s;e: Whereupon <HI>Fortunatus</HI> his Men began to look about very diligently, and at la&s;t under the Bed e&s;pyed the Pur&s;e, which they took up, and delivered to their Ma&s;ter, who did not a little rejoyce that he had re|covered it; but fearing lea&s;t by its being cut from his Girdle, it might have lo&s;t its Vertue, he &s;ecretly put it under the Bed-cloaths, and then thru&s;ting in his hand, drew out Money as formerly; then he began to rejoyce, and putting on his Cloaths, cau&s;ed a Fire to
<PB N="37" REF="21"> be made, and Wine to be brought: when the Morning was far gone, his Hor&s;es being made ready, he rode abroad, and in his way ordred <HI>Leopaldus</HI> and his Servants to &s;tay at a Tavern till he went to his Exchequer, and took Moneys thence &s;ufficient for his purpo&s;e; &s;o that having bought Five new Pur&s;es, he put in one of them <HI>100</HI> Crowns, the which he gave to <HI>Leopoldus</HI> to buy Nece&s;|&s;aries, and into the re&s;t <HI>10</HI> Crowns apiece, the which he gave to his Men every one, bidding them be careful of Thieves for the future; then went he and took out <HI>400</HI> Crowns; which he had promi&s;ed to be&s;tow upon the Maid in Marriage, and &s;o returned to his Inn, and willed his Ho&s;t to go again to the Parents of the Maid; which he did, and finding her likewi&s;e at home, he told the Father upon what account he came,: How that a Gentleman that lodged at his Inn, de&s;ired him to bring his Daughter thither, and he would do good for her in order to procure her a happy Match: but the old man thinking it was a Trap to get his Daughter thither to Debauch her, would by no means con&s;ent; &s;aying, That his Daughters Virginity was all &s;he had to &s;et her off in Marriage, and if by any means &s;he &s;hould lo&s;e that, &s;he would not only undo her &s;elf, but be a &s;tain to all her Kindred; and &s;aid he, I know there are many &s;lip|pery Blades abroad, therefore I will not tru&s;t my Daughter from home among&s;t them; but if the Gentleman has any good meaning, and intends to &s;ee my Daughter, let him come to my hou&s;e and he &s;hall be welcom, but to let her come to any Gentleman abroad, I will not.</P>
<P>At this the Ho&s;t being much di&s;plea&s;ed, departed, and told <HI>For|tunatus</HI> all that had pa&s;&s;ed, endeavouring to incen&s;e him again&s;t the Virgin, and to be&s;tow his Money upon &s;ome other; but <HI>Fortuna|tus</HI> very well approving of the Fathers blunt and well-meaning, cau|&s;ed his Servants to make ready his Hor&s;e, and to attend him thi|ther; the Ho&s;t being there when they came to the Door, the Ho&s;t knocked hard, and the good man opening the &s;ame; he told him, that &s;ince he refu&s;ed to let his Daughter come to the Gentleman, he was come to her: which the good Woman hearing and perceiving his Splendid Equipage, &s;he run and cau&s;ed the Wench to put on her be&s;t Cloaths, and prick up her Ears after the be&s;t manner &s;he
<PB N="38" REF="22"> could; and &s;o with as much trouble as it is to bring a Bear to the Stake, brought her into the Room where <HI>Fortunatus</HI> was; who taking him to be a Prince at lea&s;t, fell down on her knees before him, but he gently rai&s;ed her, telling the Father on what account he came; therefore &s;aid he, if there be any young-man that is de&s;erving of her hereabouts, let him come and I will give him a good Portion with her. At which the Mother told him, Yes, there was a Neigh|bours Son who loved her intirely, and would have wedded her long ago, had not his Parents re&s;trained him, by rea&s;on her Portion was no ways an&s;werable to his: Then <HI>Fortunatus</HI> asked the Maid, if &s;he liked the Youth? to which &s;he replyed, She would be ruled by her Parents, and what they thought fit &s;hould be a law with her: Nay, nay, &s;ays her Mother, and it &s;hall plea&s;e yout Maje&s;ty, &s;he likes him well enough, and has upon my Faith and Troath a Months mind to him, but that the Bagage is &s;hame-fac'd: Then <HI>Fortunatus</HI> order|ed the Youth to be &s;ent for, and found that they were of a fit age to be coupled; whereupon <HI>Fortunatus</HI> asked him, if he could like to take that Virgin for his Wife, if he would give her a Portion? to which he an&s;wered, With a very good will, if he would give her any thing con&s;iderable; for I love her well enough, but dare not marry her without a Portion, lea&s;t my Friends &s;hould di&s;inherit me: And then he asked the Maid if &s;he was willing, who mode&s;tly replyed, Yes; then the Friends being had, he &s;ent for a Prie&s;t, who having joyned them in Matrimony, he delivered to the young-man a Pur&s;e with <HI>400</HI> Crowns, who with many &s;crapings and cringings received the &s;ame: He al&s;o gave Money to the Parents of the Maid to buy them Cloaths, and provide the Wedding-Dinner; for which they gave him a thou&s;and thanks, and prai&s;ed God that had rai&s;ed them up &s;uch a Friend in time of need.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> by the Kings Command, was married to fair <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra,</HI> Daughter to the Lord <HI>Nemina.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WIthin a while after his Arrival in <HI>Cyprus,</HI> he purcha&s;ed the greate&s;t part of his Fathers E&s;tate, which was Sold and Mortgaged; then built he a fair Palace, a Church and Chantry, with Hou&s;es for 12 Prie&s;ts, endowing them with 1400 Crowns a year; made &s;tately Parks, Gardens, Fountains, and Fi&s;h-ponds, with many other rare Devices; In&s;omuch that mo&s;t of the Noble-men of <HI>Cyprus</HI> were proud of his Company, and many were very de&s;i|rous to match their Daughters to him: In&s;omuch that the King him&s;elf taking notice of it, and being in di&s;cour&s;e with the Lord <HI>Ne|mina,</HI> who had three fair Daughters; he asked him what he thought if <HI>Fortunatus</HI> &s;hould reque&s;t one of his Daughters in marriage? Why truly, replyed he, and it may plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, I do not think it fit, for I perceive he has no great E&s;tate, and although he has ready Money, he is &s;o prodigal both in Expences and Building, that it cannot la&s;t long; and therefore I believe your Maje&s;ty would not advi&s;e me to match any of my Daughters to him, lea&s;t, as his Father did, he at la&s;t &s;hould come to poverty, notwith&s;tanding his Riches: Indeed, &s;aid the King, he has built a fair Palace, and many other &s;tately Edifices, yet his E&s;tate is not at all Impaired; for I have been informed that he has Iewels by him worth 100000 Crowns, and yet he will not &s;ell one of them; therefore if you will take my Advice, offer him one of your Daughters, and I will &s;econd the matter.</P>
<P>By this the Earl perceiving that <HI>Fortunatus</HI> was highly in the Kings Favour, he &s;aid, Well, if it plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, I will com|mit my Daughters to your di&s;po&s;e, and with whatever your Maje&s;ty &s;hall do, I will be well &s;atisfied: to which the King an&s;wered, That &s;ince he repo&s;ed &s;o much tru&s;t in him, he would not only give her in marriage, but give her a Dowry likewi&s;e; and thereupon ordered the Earl to &s;end his three Daughters to the Queen: Whereupon he went

<P>The King having notice that they were come, he &s;ent for <HI>Fortu|natus,</HI> telling him, that he under&s;tood he had a de&s;ign to take him a Wife, and that he being loath any of ba&s;e Extraction &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o fair and co&s;tly a Building, him&s;elf would, if he thought fit, provide him One of Noble Birth, and &s;uch an One as he doubted not but would plea&s;e him: Whereupon <HI>Fortunatus</HI> bowing low, gave his Maje&s;ty many thanks, &s;aying, That indeed he intended to &s;eek out for a Wife; but &s;ince his Maje&s;ty had &s;o far conde&s;cended as to give him&s;elf the trouble of providing him One, he would not look any further, but wholly &s;ubmit to what his Maje&s;ty thought fit: Then &s;aid the King, I have in my Palace three fair Virgins, Daughters to the Lord of <HI>Nemina,</HI> of tho&s;e you &s;hall take your choice; there|fore &s;ay whether you will &s;ee them &s;eparate, or altogether: At this <HI>For|tunatus</HI> pau&s;ed not, but replyed, If it may plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty, I would &s;ee them together, and hear them &s;peak one after another; that you &s;hall, &s;aid the King; and thereupon &s;ent one of his Pages to the Queen, to get the Ladies in a readine&s;s, for that he was to bring a Gue&s;t into the Pre&s;ence-Chamber; and having notice that they were prepared, he took <HI>Fortunatus</HI> by the hand, who likewi&s;e de&s;ired that <HI>Leopoldus</HI> might go with him, which the King con&s;enting to, they went all three together; when being come, the King &s;ate down and cau&s;ed the Ladies to be brought before him, and placed in order according to their years, the elde&s;t being named <HI>Germania,</HI> the next <HI>Marcepia,</HI> and the younge&s;t <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra.</HI></P>

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe Ladies being placed in order, the King demanded of the el|de&s;t, whether &s;he had rather continue at Court and be one of the Queens Maids of Honour, or with her Father and Mother; to which, with a mode&s;t Deportment, &s;he an&s;wered; That may it plea&s;e my So|veraign Lord the King, it is not &s;eemly that I &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of my &s;elf, but rather that I &s;ubmit to what your Maje&s;ty or my Father &s;hall think mo&s;t convenient; then &s;aid the King to the next, tell me <HI>Marcenia</HI> which from your heart you love be&s;t, the Earl your Father, or the Counte&s;s your Mother: to which &s;he replyed, That is a hard Que&s;tion, and therefore I mu&s;t humbly beg your Maje&s;ties pardon to excu&s;e me, if I an&s;wer not directly to this Point; becau&s;e I love them both &s;o well, I know not how to incline to either hand, and therefore mu&s;t be &s;ilent as to my report in that Affair; then the King &s;aid, <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra</HI> prithee tell me, &s;hould your Father and Mother be here, and &s;everal young Nobles were dancing, and if your Mother &s;hould bid you Dance, and your Father forbid the &s;ame, which would you choo&s;e to obey: Indeed my Gracious Soveraign, &s;aid &s;he, that Oue&s;tion is unan&s;werable, e&s;pecially upon &s;uch &s;hort warning, and by one who&s;e tender years are not capable of di&s;cerning things as they are, for &s;hould I obey one, I &s;hould di&s;obey the other, and on either hand prove di&s;obedient.</P>
<P>The King having asked them thus far, ordered them to withdraw; and then he asked <HI>Fortunatus</HI> which he be&s;t approved of: truly my Gracious Lord, I like them all &s;o well, that on a &s;udden the Choice is difficult; therefore if your Maje&s;ty will permit me to retire for an hours &s;pace to con&s;ult with my Friend about the matter, I will return your Maje&s;ty an account of my Choice, which the King con|&s;ented to; and thereupon they retired into the withdrawing Room;
<PB N="46" REF="26"> where <HI>Fortunatus</HI> asked <HI>Leopoldus</HI> what he thought, and how he would advi&s;e him to make his Choice? but <HI>Leopoldus</HI> declined it, &s;aying, That in matters of Love there could be no direct Choice made but by the Party who was to enjoy the Lady; for &s;ays he, What may &s;eem mo&s;t beautiful to me, may in your opinion &s;eem o|therwi&s;e; and therefore pray excu&s;e me in this particular: but when <HI>Fortunatus</HI> urged, he &s;aid, Well, &s;eeing you will have it &s;o, do you &s;it at one end of the Table, and I will &s;it at the other, and there we will write the Name of Her, who we be&s;t like; you as you think fit, and I according to my opinion: This plea&s;ed <HI>Fortunatus</HI> well, and when they had both written, they compared the Names, and they were one and the &s;ame; &s;o that <HI>Fortunatus</HI> &s;weetly rejoyced that <HI>Leopol|dus</HI> had approved of his Choice, and then went he joyfully to the King, and told him he had cho&s;e <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra;</HI> whereupon the King ordered her to be brought, and &s;ending for his Chaplain in&s;tantly, cau&s;ed them to be married, though to the no little &s;urprize of the La|dy,<FIGURE>

<P>After the Celebration of the Marriage, <HI>Fortunatus</HI> and his Bride were joyed by the King, Queen, and Nobles, but the Si&s;ters of <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra</HI> wept for madne&s;s that their younger Si&s;ter &s;hould be

<P>Then &s;aid the King; I think it convenient that the Wedding Fea&s;t be kept in our Pallace; nay, &s;aid <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> I be&s;eech your Maje|&s;ty let it be at my own Hou&s;e in <HI>Famogo&s;ta;</HI> it would content me, &s;aid the King, that it &s;hould be there, were it not for the exce&s;&s;ive charge it will put you to; no matter for that, &s;aid <HI>Fortunatus,</HI> for there is nothing that can be had in all the <HI>I&s;le</HI> of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> but it &s;hall be there at your Maje&s;ties &s;ervice; and if it &s;hall plea&s;e your Maje&s;ty to ordein Tilts and Turnaments, I &s;hall be exceeding glad, that I may prove my &s;elf a man before your Maje&s;ty; to all this the King con&s;ented, and ordered his Nobles to be ready within two days, to de|part for <HI>Famogo&s;ta;</HI> as likewi&s;e the Ladys that waited upon the Queen, and others: and for that day the Bridegroom and Bride dined privately with the King and Queen.</P>

<P>How <HI>Fortunatus</HI> prevailed with his Wife to Travel again, and what befel him during his being abroad.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHen <HI>Fortunatus</HI> had lived with his Wife about &s;ixteen years, he began to think of his former Travels, con&s;idering that for the mo&s;t part they had been in <HI>Europe;</HI> whereupon he had been deprived of &s;eeing &s;uch &s;trange Rarities as other Countries in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> did pro|duce, he thereupon re&s;olved to travel once again, but dur&s;t not for a long time di&s;clo&s;e his Mind to his Wife, for fear of driving her into a Fit of Melancholy; but at la&s;t as he was walking with her in the Garden, he began to di&s;cour&s;e her about his former Travels, and at la&s;t told her, that &s;eeing it was not likely that he &s;hould have any more Children, he was purpo&s;ed to &s;ee the <HI>Indies, Egypt,</HI> and <HI>Pale&s;ti|na,</HI> for that he had already travelled over one half of the World. This drew Tears from the fair <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra,</HI> who with tender weeping and
<PB N="52" REF="29"> many Intreaties be&s;ought him out of love to her and her Children, and by all the mutual Ties of their Conjugal Love, not to leave her: for in his ab&s;ence her life would be altogether comfortle&s;s: Then he comforted her, telling her, he would make but a &s;hort &s;tay of it, reck|oning to return within a year; but this nothing pacified the di&s;con|&s;olate Lady, who demanded of him in what &s;he had offended, that he who was the Ioy of her Life, would leave her? and that if &s;he had tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed in ought, &s;he would double her Obedience for the future: To which he an&s;wered, that &s;he never offended him, but that he lo|ved her as dear as his life, yet he was re&s;olved to go, and nothing but Sickne&s;s or Death &s;hould hinder him; then &s;he de&s;ired him if he would needs go, that he &s;hould travel into a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Country, and not expo&s;e his life to the Cruelty of <HI>Heathens,</HI> who mo&s;t of all envy <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and &s;eek their blood; to which he replyed, That he had &s;een all the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Countries already, and that now he re&s;olved to &s;ee both the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the places he had before named: But when &s;he perceived &s;he could not prevail with him neither by Tears nor Intrea|ty, &s;he fell down in a Swound, which moved <HI>Fortunatus</HI> to Compa&s;|&s;ion; when coming to her &s;elf, &s;he &s;ighed bitterly, &s;aying, O what have I done that I mu&s;t lo&s;e the Ioy of my Life &s;o &s;oon? Then &s;he &s;ent to her Father and Mother to come and intreat him to &s;tay, but they prevailed not: So that when &s;he &s;aw there was no way to pre|vail, and that he had made a Vow to depart, &s;he began a little to be contented, and upon his promi&s;e of a quick return, unwillingly yield|ed; when as <HI>Fortunatus</HI> leaving her 10000.

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHen <HI>Fortunatus</HI> from the top of an Hill beheld the Palace which glittered with Gold, &s;o that by rea&s;on of the reflection of the Sun-beams it &s;hone like a Comet, he greatly admired it, &s;ay|ing, That &s;ince it was &s;o fair without, it mu&s;t needs be very beau|tiful within, and &s;o by Noon he approached it; at which tune the Emperor and his Lords were returned from hunting of wild Bea&s;ts, whereupon he had the opportunity of &s;eeing them clad in warlike Ha|biliments, which was after &s;o &s;trange a manner, that he greatly won|d'red; when they were all entred, he came to the Porter, and demand|ed if he and his Companions might not be admitted to behold the Palace, and take a view of the Emperor's Magnificent Entertain|ment,
<PB N="56" REF="31"> that &s;o they might report it to his Prai&s;e, when they returned into their own Country: The Porter perceiving that they were Gentlemen and Strangers, freely admitted them; upon which <HI>For|tunatus</HI> gave him a Ruby worth 30 Crowns: then coming into the Emperor's Pre&s;ence, he &s;ignified to him, thet he had &s;ome Pre&s;ents for him, and thereupon drew forth his Iewels, which were very rich, for he always bought the faire&s;t; which the Emperor accepting of, gave him many thanks, and ord'red his chief Officer to fea&s;t them no|bly, and to &s;hew them all the Riches of his Palace, which were &s;uch as <HI>Fortunatus</HI> had never &s;een before; for the Walls &s;ome were pla|ted with Silver, wherein were ingraven Stories of Knights and Battels, with the valiant Atchievements of the former Emperors; others were hung with Panthars Skins, which ca&s;t a fragrant &s;mell; the Pillars that &s;upported the Hall they were of Cedar over-laid with Gold, and imbo&s;&s;ed with precious Stones: This plea&s;ed <HI>For|tunatus</HI> &s;o well, that he gave the Officer a Iewel worth 100 Duckets. Now when Dinner-time was come, <HI>Fortunatus</HI> and his Men were &s;et down with the chief Officers and Noble-men; for &s;uch is the Cu|&s;tom of the Country, that none but the Princes of the Blood may Dine with the Emperor: Now in the mid&s;t of their Mirth, <HI>For|tunatus</HI> perceived the Bottles and Flagons begin to dance upon the Table, at which he began greatly to wonder; when one that &s;ate by him whi&s;per'd him in the Ear, and told him it was done by Magick, and that the Emperor kept two <HI>Necromancers</HI> to make Pa&s;time for Strangers; now after the Bottles had done dancing, there &s;prung up a Tree full of fair Oranges, which &s;everal Blacks came and plucked off, and then the Tree vani&s;hed; after that a large Stag came running in, and after him a Pack of Hounds at full Cry, who taking a Cour&s;e or two round the Hall vani&s;hed; then &s;everal fair Women in &s;trange Attire came in playing upon Lutes, and after having danced a turn or two, vani&s;hed: At this <HI>Fortunatus</HI> was greatly amazed, but well con&s;idering with him&s;elf it was only a De|lu&s;ion of the Devil, and no real Sub&s;tance, he re&s;ted the better con|tent: Now when Dinner was ended, the Emperor &s;ent for <HI>For|tunatus</HI> to ride a Hunting with him, which he gladly did, and com|ing into a Fore&s;t about &s;ix Miles from the Palace, there they rouzed
<PB N="57" REF="31"> a Lyon who was &s;leeping in the Thicket, who &s;haked his brindled Mane, and reared &s;o loud, that all the Fore&s;t trembled; upon which the Dogs were uncoupled, of which he roar &s;everal in pieces, and fought again&s;t &s;everal of them for the &s;pace of an Hour; when the <HI>Indians</HI> came running with their Lances, and run him into the body, &s;o that he fell down dead, then took they off his Skin as a Trophy of Victory: After that the Dogs found out a great wild Boar, upon which they fa&s;tned, notwith&s;tanding he gored many of them with his horrid Tusks, which were at lea&s;t a foot long, &amp; then the Iavelings be|ing darted thick at him, he at la&s;t was killed, and his Head being cut off, was carried before the Emperor upon a Spear, as likewi&s;e the Lyon's Skin.</P>
<P>By this time Sun was &s;et, which made the Emperor ha&s;ten to his Palace, where, at Supper-time, <HI>Fortunatus</HI> drew a great deal of Gold out of his Pur&s;e, and gave among&s;t &s;uch as attended at the Table, which the <HI>Necromancers</HI> perceiving, who were al&s;o &s;itting at the Table, they thought with them&s;elves this Stranger mu&s;t needs be exceeding Rich, that can thus liberally di&s;pence with his Money, therefore it will not be ami&s;s when he is in Bed, if we u&s;e our Art, to get &s;ome of him; &s;o that when all was done, and every one gone to their Chambers, they began to mutter over their Charms, and by that means rai&s;ed their Familiars, commandig them to tell them who the Stranger was, and how he came by &s;uch quantities of Gold and Iewels; to which they replyed, He was a Merchant of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and that he had a &s;ecret Mine which they were forbidden to reveal, which could not be emptied during his Life, and thereupon they vani&s;hed: Now the Conjurers &s;ent for their Wives, who had familiar Spirits likewi&s;e, to attend them, and could tran&s;|form them&s;elves, to appearance, into any &s;hape: they being come, the Conjurers commanded them, in the &s;hapes of Monkeys, to enter <HI>Fortunatus</HI> his Lodgings, and bring thence what Trea&s;ure they could find; the which they readily obeyed: when opening the Ca&s;e|ments, they entred; but by clapping them to and again, <HI>Fortunatus</HI> awoke, and &s;uppo&s;ing that they had been Thieves, drew his Sword, and &s;triking at a venture, cut one of their Fore-feet off, whereupon they got out at the Window again, making &s;uch a lamentable Noi&s;e

<P><HI>FOrtunatus</HI> being impatient of delay, lea&s;t he &s;hould break his pro|mi&s;e with his Wife; after &s;upper was ended, he drew out a great deal of Gold, and be&s;towed it freely upon the &s;ervants, and again demanded leave to depart: but the <HI>Souldan</HI> &s;eeing his infinite riches, thought that unle&s;s he &s;hewed him his, he might boa&s;t in his own Country that he had the greater wealth: whereupon he de&s;ired him to follow him; and &s;o led him into his Trea&s;ury which was all hung with Cloath of Tin&s;e, and the Tables &s;pread with Iewels, Rings, and Ve&s;&s;els of Gold and Silver, Gold Chains, and huge Pearls, with many other things of great price, which <HI>Fortunatus</HI> had ne|ver &s;een the like before: then he had him into another Room, where he &s;hewed him on infinite ma&s;s of mony; and now, &s;ays he, I have one thing more that I e&s;teem above all that you have yet beheld, this made <HI>Fortunatus</HI> wonder: for, thought he, it mu&s;t be of an ine&s;teemable price if it exceed what I have &s;een already, and thereupon he grew impatient to have a view of it: when as the <HI>Souldian</HI> taking him by the hand, led him into another Chamber; and there taking down an old hat, &s;aid, this is the Iewel; at which <HI>Fortunatus</HI> &s;miled, telling him that was an old hat, and might be bought for a &s;mall matter: yes, &s;aid the <HI>Souldian,</HI> if it was only a hat, it was of no value, but there is &s;uch a &s;ecret retained in it, that for all the hats in the World, I would not leave it; nay, &s;hould I loo&s;e all my Iewels, I could purcha&s;e more, but &s;hould I loo&s;e this hat, &s;uch another the World affords not: then was <HI>Fortunatus</HI> very de&s;ireous to know the &s;ecret it retained; then &s;aid the <HI>Souldan;</HI> &s;ince you are my friend, I will impart it to you; which is this, that having this hat on, where ever you wi&s;h your &s;elf to be, thither &s;hall you be conveyed almo&s;t as &s;wift as can be

</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>FOrtunatus</HI> after two months departure from <HI>Alexandria,</HI> arri|ved at <HI>Cyprus,</HI> where he was joyfully met by a great number of Nobility, and conducted to the Kings pre&s;ence; who welcomed him home, and asked him of his travels, the which he at large related, and then taking his leave, put on his Wi&s;hing Hat, and going without the City, wi&s;hed him&s;elf at his own Hou&s;e, and was there in a trice: when coming in, he met <HI>Ca&s;&s;andra,</HI> who run to him, and cla&s;ping him in her arms, could not &s;peak to him a good while for joy; then he ha|ving
<PB N="63" REF="34"> &s;aluted his Sons and Servants, he commanded meat to be &s;et before him; and the next day invited a great number of his neigh|bours to dine with him, whom he fea&s;ted after the be&s;t manner.</P>
<P>Now when he had been at home about eight days, on the 10th of his arrival in the I&s;land, <HI>Marcholandus,</HI> who was &s;ent by the <HI>Sold|an,</HI> came to his Hou&s;e, and de&s;ired to &s;peak with him; who coming to him, he de&s;ired that they might be in private: whereupon <HI>Fortunatus</HI> took him by the hand, and led him into the Dining Room, and then willed him to declared his bu&s;ine&s;s; whereupon he delivered him the <HI>Sol|dans</HI> Letter, and therewithal informed him how ungreatful he had been, in taking away the Hat, yet the <HI>Soldan</HI> would forget it all, and highly reward him, if he would re&s;tore it; I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;aid <HI>For|tunatus,</HI> the <HI>Soldan</HI> has cau&s;e to be offended, but let him thank his own folly in putting it upon my Head, I knew not the vertue of it before he declared it; and therefore &s;ince I ran the hazard of drowning, by flying on Ship-board with it, I am in the mind never to part with it. Then <HI>Marcholandus</HI> told him what offers the <HI>Soldan</HI> had made him, if he would re&s;tore it: and therefore out of all love de&s;ired him to let him carry it with him, or that he would carry it him&s;elf; but <HI>Fortunatus</HI> told him he would not part with it for the <HI>Soldan's</HI> Kingdom, and therefore willed him to cea&s;e his &s;uit.</P>
<P>Vpon this, <HI>Marcholandus</HI> growing impatient, began to threaten him; &s;aying, that he would complain to the King, and if no redre&s;s could be had there, the <HI>Soldan</HI> would right him by Arms: at which <HI>Fortunatus</HI> &s;miling, bid him do as he plea&s;ed, and thereupon <HI>Marcho|landus</HI> departed to the Court, where procuring to be admitted to the King's pre&s;ence, he grievou&s;ly complained of <HI>Fortunatts;</HI> telling all that had happened concerning the Hat, and de&s;ired his Maie&s;ty to u&s;e his Prerogative Royal, in compelling him to re&s;tore it; but the King &s;aid that <HI>Fortunatus</HI> was his dear friend, and he would not in any wi&s;e u&s;e compul&s;ion towards him; but if he would deliver it up of his own accord well and good, but if not, the Law was open, and he mu&s;t take his Regular Cour&s;e. But <HI>Marcholandus</HI> well knew that <HI>Fortunatus</HI> was too powerfull in his own Country, for a &s;tranger to wage Law again&s;t him: whereupon he told the King, that upon the re|fu&s;al of delivering the Hat, he had a Commi&s;&s;ion to denounce War, e|ven

</ARGUMENT>
<P>THe next Morning <HI>Andolocia</HI> coming to the Court, was ad|mitted into <HI>Agrypina's</HI> Chamber, a favour that he never be|fore enjoyed; at which he exceedingly rejoyced, thinking with him&s;elf that this was a happy opportunity, and pro&s;perous; he had not long been there before the Prince&s;s came, and with a merry Countenance, wi&s;hed him a good Morning; at which he humbly thanked her Grace, and then &s;he cau&s;ed him to &s;it down by her, and fell to di&s;cour&s;e about divers Affairs: as of his Travels, Birth, and Parentage, &s;o that in &s;uch like di&s;cour&s;es, they &s;pent much time; then began <HI>Andolocia</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="39"> to expre&s;s the pa&s;&s;ion he had for her, and that how for her &s;ake, he would adventure any hazard. Alas! &s;aid &s;he, I am not at my own di&s;po&s;e, for if I were, your E&s;tate would &s;oon decrea&s;e at the rate you live, and then I &s;hould come to poverty; fear not that my Love, and deare&s;t part of Life, my E&s;tate can never grow le&s;s then it is, al|though I &s;hould &s;pend a Million a week: then belike &s;aid <HI>Aggrypina,</HI> your Father is &s;ome Pui&s;&s;ant Prince: not &s;o, &s;aid <HI>Andolocia,</HI> my Father is Dead, nor was he, neither am I, a Prince; his Riches and mine were equal, and though we both have &s;pent to exce&s;s, yet had we never the le&s;s.</P>
<P>This made <HI>Aggrypina</HI> wonder, and therefore &s;he was the more de&s;irous to know whence this infinite Trea&s;ure &s;hould flow, and be|gan to &s;hew better Countenance than ever, &s;aying, you have often told me you loved me <HI>Andolocia;</HI> and in that, &s;aid he, I have not &s;aid ami&s;s; for I prote&s;t by all that's &s;acred, I admire and adore you a|bove all Women kind, e&s;teeming you, as indeed you are, the faire&s;t of your Sex: many Ladys have I &s;een in Forraign Courts, but your bright perfections as far excells them all, as the Sun does the paler Lu&s;tre of the Moon; therefore vouch&s;afe dear Lady to cure the Wounds you have made, and pardon my boldne&s;s.</P>
<P>Then &s;aid <HI>Aggrypina,</HI> if it be true, that you love me as you &s;ay, pray tell me from whence you have &s;uch abundance of Trea&s;ure, in which when I am better &s;atisfied, you may expect my favour, but not till then? At this, <HI>Andolocia</HI> was almo&s;t exta&s;ied, being drunk with Love and doating upon her Beauty, he was re&s;olved to &s;atisfie her de&s;ire, and thus began. Madam, could you but keep it &s;ecret, I would lay open to you all the &s;ecrets of my Soul, and unfold what my Dying Father charged me not to do, though at this In&s;tant his Gho&s;t &s;hould ri&s;e and bla&s;t me; nay, &s;aid <HI>Aggrypina,</HI> if you loved me, you would not doubt my keeping your &s;ecrets, but your &s;crupling my Fidelity, &s;hews you love me not: by Heaven! &s;aid <HI>Andolocia,</HI> I do, and will reveal the &s;ecret, and thereupon in an unlucky hour, he drew out his Pur&s;e, &s;aying, here is my Exchequer which can never be emptied, and thereupon he pulled out 300 pieces of Gold, and gave

</FIGURE> them to <HI>Aggrypina,</HI> and then the Pur&s;e &s;eeming empty, he put in his hand and pulled out as many more, and &s;o he did &s;everal times; &s;aying, thus can I do for many years together, and yet can never empty this Pur&s;e during my Life; this was left by my Father, and given to him by Dame <HI>Fortune,</HI> in a Wilderne&s;s, as he was tra|velling to &s;ee &s;trange Countrys. <HI>Aggrypina</HI> having now under|&s;tood what &s;he mo&s;t de&s;ired, &s;he began to Plot how &s;he might get the Pur&s;e into her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and therefore told <HI>Andolocia,</HI> that if he would promi&s;e faithfully to marry her, he &s;hould lie with her before|hand, for that the King and Queen lodged that night in a Summer Hou&s;e at the upper end of the Garden, and that by bribing her chief Woman, he might be admitted into her Chamber: this made him leap for joy, promi&s;ing to gain admittance what ever it co&s;t him; and &s;o taking his leave of her, with a thou&s;and thanks for that &s;he had vouch&s;afed to pitty him, he departed: then went <HI>Aggrypina</HI> to the King and Queen, and declared all that had happened, and how &s;he had given him hopes of enjoying her that night, with a de&s;ign to be|reive him of his Pur&s;e: the Queen commended her Wit, and order|ed a Pur&s;e to be made like to that <HI>Aggrypina</HI> had de&s;cribed. When they had done, they prepared a &s;leepy Potion; ordering the Cup|bearer to put it into the Wine that <HI>Andolocia</HI> &s;hould drink: which
<PB N="74" REF="40"> being done to the Life, about eight in the Evening, <HI>Andolocia</HI> came and inquired for the Prince&s;&s;es Woman, as if he had a Letter to de|liver: and when he had found her, he gave her a Pur&s;e with a 100 Crowns in it, telling his purpo&s;e; of which &s;he made &s;omething &s;trange, though &s;he knew it from the Prince&s;s: yet &s;he &s;hut him in|to the Prince&s;&s;es Chamber, where he had not &s;tayed long, before <HI>Ag|grypina</HI> came and bid him welcome, then &s;he &s;ent the Matron for two Bottles of Wine, one for <HI>Andolocia,</HI> and another for her &s;elf: telling him, in token of the Love &s;he bear him, &s;he would drink off a full bowl, and hoped that he would do the like; now the Woman had notice to put the Drugs into that he was to drink, which &s;he did accor|dingly: after <HI>Andolocia</HI> had drunk it off, he began to grow drou&s;iy, &s;o that within a while, <HI>Aggrypina</HI> and her Woman talked him fa&s;t a&s;leep, then &s;he &s;ending her Woman away, turned a&s;ide his Coat, and took off the Pur&s;e, in the Room of which, &s;he placed a Counterfeit one, and then went to the King and Queen; who with much impa|tience expected her coming.</P>
<P>She was no &s;ooner come but they demanded how &s;he &s;ped, to which &s;he an&s;wered, &s;he had &s;ped as &s;he wi&s;hed, for here &s;ays &s;he is the Gol|den Pur&s;e; and with that, putting her hand into it, &s;he pulled out &s;everal handfuls of Gold, at which the King and Queen greatly re|joyced: then the King demanded her to give it into his keeping, but the Queen &s;aid, &s;ince &s;he had ventured for it, it was but Rea&s;on &s;he &s;hould keep it.</P>
<P>Now whil&s;t this di&s;cour&s;e held, <HI>Andolocia</HI> awoke, and &s;tarting up as one amazed, found that he had &s;lept in the Chair all night, which did not a little perplex him; when in the mid&s;t of his trouble, in came the Old Woman, of whom he demanded where <HI>Aggrypina</HI> was? &s;he told him that &s;he having layn alone all night in expectation of his waking and coming to bed to her, &s;he was now ri&s;en, being ve|ry much grieved that he &s;hould &s;o di&s;appoint her. And farther &s;he told him, that although they jogged him, and u&s;ed many endeavours, they could not wake him; then concluded <HI>Andolocia,</HI> it was done by the Inchantment of &s;ome that envyed his happine&s;s, and thereupon departed pen&s;ive to his Hou&s;e, as having lo&s;t &s;o happy an opportunity; that he was out of all hopes of regaining &s;uch another, but little dreamt his Pur&s;e was gone.</P>

<P>How the King &s;ent to <HI>Andolocia</HI> to prepare a Dinner for him, and how when he found his Pur&s;e was lo&s;t, he left his Hou&s;e in great heavyne&s;s, and departed for <HI>Cyprus.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOw the King being de&s;irous to try how <HI>Andolocia</HI> would be|have him&s;elf after the lo&s;s of his Pur&s;e, &s;ent his Steward to him to acquaint him, that by rea&s;on a &s;tranger was come to Court, he purpo&s;ed to bring him to his Hou&s;e, and therefore willed him to provide accordingly, which <HI>Andolocia</HI> promi&s;ed, as not yet having e&s;&s;ayed his Pur&s;e. After the Me&s;&s;enger was gone, he called his Steward, and bid him provide for the King's entertainment, &s;uch things as he thought mo&s;t fit; to which he replyed, his mony was &s;pent in the late co&s;tly Banquets, and to furni&s;h a new one he mu&s;t have more mony; with that <HI>Andolocia</HI> put his hand into his Pur&s;e as formerly, but to his great amazement found nothing in it; then be|gan he to turn it and look upon it, but found it was not the &s;ame: then he waxed exceeding &s;orrowful, and much repented him of his folly, that, contrary to his Fathers Command, he had declared the &s;e|crets of his Pur&s;e: as likewi&s;e, how he had been deceived by a Wo|man not long before, which might have been a fair warning to him how he again tru&s;ted any of that treacherous Sex; and in utter di&s;|pair ever to gain it by fair means, he called all his Servants about him, telling them that he had heard of the Death of his Brother in <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and mu&s;t in&s;tantly depart thither to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Land, and therefore willed them to take what wages was due: be&s;ides their Hor&s;es and the furniture of the Hou&s;e he would freely be&s;tow upon them, and then leave them to &s;hift for them&s;elves, for that it would be too great a trouble to carry Servants over the Sea.</P>

Then <HI>Ampedo</HI> began to ask him about the Pur&s;e, who an|&s;wered in a mournful tone, that by di&s;obliging his Fathers Command, he had lo&s;t it; how! &s;aid <HI>Ampedo,</HI> by fraud or force? nay, &s;aid he, by fraud; for falling in Love with a fair Lady, her beauty &s;o far bewitched me, that at her intreaty I told her the &s;ecret virtue of it; in|&s;omuch that when I was a&s;leep, &s;he got it from my Girdle, and pla|ced a fal&s;e one in the Room of it. This it is, &s;aid <HI>Ampedo,</HI> to be di&s;o|bedient, had it not been better for you to have &s;tayed at home, without running any hazard, then thus to loo&s;e the be&s;t Trea&s;ure the World can afford? now, if we come to poverty, &s;hall we be the laughing &s;tock and &s;corn of all that have formerly known our manner of li|ving.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>How <HI>Andolocia</HI> deceived his Brother, and got his Wi&s;hing Hat, with which he came into <HI>England,</HI> and carried away <HI>Aggrypina</HI> and the Pur&s;e, into a de&s;art place, and what there befel.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOw when <HI>Andolocia</HI> had continued a while with his Brother, he one day told him, that if he would lend him his Wi&s;hing
<PB N="77" REF="41"> Hat, he did not yet doubt to recover the Pur&s;e: but <HI>Ampedo</HI> would by no means con&s;ent thereto, &s;aying, that he was wi&s;er than &s;o, and that the be&s;t way was to &s;it down w th the fir&s;t lo&s;s; for, &s;aid he, I doubt not but to get 10000 Duckets for the Hat when our mony is &s;pent: &s;o that when <HI>Andolocia</HI> perceived he would not part with it for an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Voyage, he let him alone a good while, and then ta|king his opportunity when his men were gon a Hunting, he de&s;ired him to let him have the Hat only to get among&s;t them, that he might &s;ee the &s;port: to this <HI>Ampedo</HI> con&s;ented, but <HI>Andolocia</HI> had no &s;ooner put it on, but he wi&s;hed him&s;elf at <HI>Venice,</HI> and was in&s;tantly conveyed there through the Ayr: where he enquired for &s;everal <HI>Jews</HI> who were wont to trade in Rich Iewels, and de&s;ired that he might &s;ee their Iewels, the which they con&s;ented to, in hopes of a Chapman; but <HI>Andolocia</HI> had no &s;ooner got them in his hands, but he wi&s;hed him&s;elf in <HI>England,</HI> and was &s;uddenly carryed thither, the <HI>Jews</HI> imagining him to be no other than the Devil; and ble&s;&s;ed them&s;elves that they did not take any of his mony.</P>
<P>When he came into <HI>England,</HI> he di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf in an <HI>Italian</HI> habit, and getting on a long Gown, went to the Court, and there pretending him&s;elf to be a Merchant, he in&s;inuated into the Compa|ny of <HI>Aggrypina's</HI> Gentlewomen, by giving them &s;mall pre&s;ents, that &s;o they &s;hould per&s;wade the Prince&s;s to buy his Iewels, which were very rich; with which they &s;oon acquainted her, and willed him to &s;pread them abroad as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed by, which he accordingly did, and &s;he ca&s;ting her Eyes upon them, asked if he would &s;ell any of them? yes, and if it &s;hall plea&s;e your Highne&s;s, I am come from a far Country for that purpo&s;e; then &s;he cho&s;e out &s;everal of the be&s;t, and asked him the Price, who told her &s;he &s;hould have them for 6000 Crowns, whereupon &s;he bid him 3000 Crowns; but he immagin|ing that &s;he would bring out the Pur&s;e, bargained with her for 4000 Crowns, and then &s;he ordering him to bring them into her Cham|ber, went to a Coffer, and taking thence the Pur&s;e, tyed it fa&s;t to her Girdle: which was what <HI>Andolocia</HI> looked for, who whil&s;t &s;he was telling out the Mony, cla&s;ped her fa&s;t by the Arm, and throwing her upon his back, he wi&s;hed him&s;elf in a Solitary De&s;art: and imme|diately they were both carryed out of &s;ight, to the great amazement of

O! how unlike is this to my Father's Country, I would to God I were in my Father's Palace again: the which when <HI>Andolocia</HI> heard, he ha&s;ted down the Tree to &s;tay her flight, but &s;he was gone, pa&s;t recovery, in a moment, with the Pur&s;e, Hat, and Iewels, which vexed <HI>Andolocia</HI> wor&s;e than before: whereupon he began to Cur&s;e the De&s;tinies, and the Hour wherein he was borne, &s;aying, that now he was quite undone, and his lo&s;s unreparable! When he had bewailed his misfortune a good while, he being faint and dry eat the Apples, upon which he felt a &s;uddain pain in his Head, which made him &s;uppo&s;e they were infecti|ous; but it continued not long, before a large pair of Goats Horns &s;prung up, at which he was &s;ore affrighted, and would have fled from

</FIGURE> mu&s;t thank God that I have found you here to be my comfort, for I never intend to go to any Town, unle&s;s I can be rid of this deformi|ty,
<PB N="80" REF="43"> which proceeded from eating Apples in this Wilderne&s;s; at which the Old Man laughed heartily, and the rather, to &s;ee what a piteous wry face <HI>Andolocia</HI> made; at which <HI>Andolocia</HI> being &s;omewhat di&s;plea&s;ed, told him, that he ought rather to comfort him than to in|crea&s;e his affliction: Yes, &s;aid the Hermit, I &s;hall comfort you, and therefore come into my hou&s;e, and in two hours &s;pace I'le cau&s;e thee to &s;hed thy Horns. At this <HI>Andolocia</HI> greatly rejoyced, and told the Hermit, that if he would do &s;o, he would give him 10 Crowns; keep your Money, &s;aid the Hermit, and corrupt not me with it, for if I had delighted in Riches I had not come to this place, neither need I now to live here: then <HI>Andolocia</HI> asked the old man for &s;omething to eat, who brought him out Roots, Nuts, Field-Apples, and a crui&s;e of Water, which was all the fare he lived on; then de&s;ired he would begin to cure him of his Horns; at which the Hermit went out of his Cave, and returning again about half an hour after, brought &s;ix Apples of a very fair colour with him, and wi&s;hed <HI>Andolocia</HI> to eat two of them; the which he had no &s;ooner done, but his Horns dropped off, at which he was exceeding glad, and asked the Hermit how tho&s;e Fruits came to be of &s;uch different qualities? to which he an&s;wered, The Wi&s;e Creator and Soveraign Lord of all things had &s;o di&s;po|&s;ed his bounties, that &s;eldom there is any thing hurtful, but there is likewi&s;e another thing to cure the hurt that it cau&s;es; but in all the Earth I believe there is not two Trees that retain the like qualities of the&s;e Trees.</P>
<P>Now after they had held a long di&s;cour&s;e about the bu&s;ine&s;s of the World, the Hermit bid <HI>Andolocia</HI> be mindful of the future &s;tate of his precious and immortal Soul: and &s;o guiding him to the next Town, he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him with his Ble&s;&s;ing; and <HI>Andolocia</HI> on the other hand, returned him a thou&s;and Thanks. Then went <HI>Ando|locia</HI> to the next Inn and called for Meat and Drink, afterwards he departed thence toward the Sea-&s;ide, &s;tudying all the way how he might be revenged on <HI>Agrippina;</HI> and having &s;ome of the Hornify|ing Apples in his Pocket, as likewi&s;e four of the contrary quality, which the Hermit had given him, he re&s;olved to go for <HI>London,</HI> and if po&s;&s;ible, to graft a pair of Horns upon the head of <HI>Agrippina,</HI> by which means he doubted not to recover his Hat and Pur&s;e; in order

<P>How <HI>Andolocia,</HI> by undertaking to Cure <HI>Agrippina</HI> of her Horns, fir&s;t recovered his Wi&s;hing-Hat, and afterwards his Pur&s;e, with what happened during the time.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>NOw when <HI>Andolocia</HI> was brought into <HI>Agrippina's</HI> pre&s;ence, and beheld her Horns, he inwardly rejoyced, though to appear|ance he &s;eemed &s;orry; then, &s;aid he, fair Lady, be not dejected, for I &s;hall &s;urely Cure you of your Horns: if you do, &s;aid <HI>Agrippina,</HI> I will bountifully reward you; fear it not, &s;aid <HI>Andolocia;</HI> in the &s;ame ca&s;e was an Earl's Daughter in <HI>Flanders</HI> for making fal&s;e vows to her Lover and never performing them, yet I cured her: then be|gan <HI>Aggripina</HI> to &s;igh, as imagining her breach of Faith with <HI>An|dolocia</HI> might have brought upon her that di&s;grace, then &s;he de&s;ired him to keep it &s;ecret, and &s;o gave him a 100 Crowns, upon which he went to the <HI>Apothecaries,</HI> and there, for fa&s;hions &s;ake, bought &s;e|veral Drugs, with which he mixed &s;ome &s;lices of the Aples, who&s;e quality it was to take away Horns: which working with her, &s;he &s;oon perceived her Horns to dimini&s;h; at which &s;he greatly rejoyced: but <HI>Andolocia</HI> was re&s;olved not quite to rid her of them, till &s;uch time he found opportunity to recover his Hat and Pur&s;e. A while after he cau&s;ed an Ape to be killed, and wrapped the skin about her Horns, which &s;he patiently indured: then he gave her more of the Aple, which made them &s;ink &s;o far, that they were &s;carce a handfull long; &s;o he ordered her to go to &s;leep again: when as he taking his opportunity, &s;earched about to &s;ee if peradventure he could chance on the Hat or Pur&s;e, and had the good luck to find his Wi&s;hing Hat where it was carele&s;ly layed under the bed, <HI>Aggrippina</HI> not in the lea&s;t knowing the &s;ecret vertue that remained in it; at which good hap <HI>Andolocia</HI> greatly rejoyced, and took it as a happy Pre&s;age that he &s;hould recover his Pur&s;e likewi&s;e; for now, thought he, I will take another airy Voyage with her and the Pur&s;e, to &s;ee if he could be more circum&s;pect then formerly. Whil&s;t he was thus debating, he, un&s;een of the Prince&s;s, took up the Hat and put it under his
<PB N="84" REF="45"> Coat, and thereupon began to relent of the intended Cruelty he de|&s;igned to u&s;e toward wher; which was, That when her Horns were almo&s;t gone, he would give her two Hornifying Apples that &s;hould make them ri&s;e again larger than ever, and then to depart from <HI>France,</HI> and from thence to &s;end her a Letter, who he was, and upon what occa&s;ion her Horns were grown, and that unle&s;s &s;he would come to him and bring the Pur&s;e, &s;he &s;hould never be cured of the &s;ame; whil&s;t thus he was con&s;idering, <HI>Aggrypina</HI> waked, and feel|ing on her brows, found that her Horns were almo&s;t gone, at which &s;he rejoyced exceedingly: and for <HI>Andolocia,</HI> de&s;iring him to perfect his cure as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, but he told her it was not &s;o ea&s;ily done, for that the greate&s;t part was yet remaining, which was the taking the root of the Horns out of the Skull; for which he mu&s;t u&s;e many co&s;tly Drugs, rarely to be got, and then told her &s;he &s;hould appear more beautifull and &s;plendid, then ever: this made her rejoyce the more, and promi&s;ed him any reward he would ask: for, &s;aid &s;he, if this di&s;grace continue by me, I &s;hall be a&s;hamed ever to appear in publick. Well, &s;aid <HI>Andolocia,</HI> as for the taking them away, I do not in the lea&s;t doubt, but the Drugs will co&s;t a great deal of mony: no matter for that, &s;pare for no mony, &s;aid <HI>Aggrypina,</HI> for whatever it co&s;t, I care not: nay, but &s;aid <HI>Andolocia,</HI> I have not mony enough to pur|cha&s;e the third part of them, of my own, therefore your highne&s;s mu&s;t disbur&s;t 500 Crowns at lea&s;t, for there mu&s;t be many ingredients; as, Pearl, Corral, Rubies, Amber-Greece, Civit, Opopanax, Gal|banum, Franken&s;ence, Mirh, and other co&s;tly things; upon which <HI>Aggrypina</HI> not knowing whom &s;he had to deal withal, putting on her Cloaths, went to a large Cabbinet, in which all her trea&s;ure lay, and after &s;he had unlocked it, took out the &s;o much de&s;ired Purfe, and fa&s;tened it to her Girdle as &s;he was wont upon the like occa&s;ion; <HI>An|dolocia</HI> well noteing, drew her towards the Window, and there &s;et open the Ca&s;ement, telling her that he was dim-&s;ighted and could not well &s;ee his mony in a dark room: whereupon, as &s;he began to tell out the mony he claped on his Hat, which till then he had held privately under his Coat, and cla&s;ping her fa&s;t, wi&s;hed him&s;elf in a &s;olitary De&s;art: the which he no &s;ooner had done, but they were hoi&s;ted up the Ayr, and carried invi&s;ibly over many Citys and Towns till

Now when &s;he was carryed away, her Women were in great perplexity, &s;ome weep|ing, and others tearing their hair, in&s;omuch that their Lamentati|ons being heard, the King and Queen &s;uppo&s;ed the Prince&s;s was Dead, for that they had notice &s;he was &s;ick &s;ome time before: where|upon they came into her Lodgings, and demanded the cau&s;e of &s;uch extravagant &s;orrow; whereupon the Old Woman with much &s;ob|ing and &s;ighing told them, that the fair <HI>Aggrypina</HI> was again car|ried away, as before: by one that pretended him&s;elf a Phy&s;itian, and undertook to cure her of certain Horns, which by a &s;trange accident grew mon&s;trou&s;ly out of her Head: at this, they were both grieved, but comforted them&s;elves in hopes &s;he would return as &s;he had done before: but when &s;everal days were over, and &s;he came not, they be|gan to de&s;pair of her recovery.</P>
<P>Then &s;aid the King, I wi&s;h I had never per&s;waded her to bereave <HI>Andolocia</HI> of his inchanted Pur&s;e: for had he kept that &s;till, we had had our Daughter: for pa&s;t doubt, he is a <HI>Negromancer</HI> him&s;elf, or deals with &s;uch as are, and by that means has the&s;e two times con|veyed her away: and I am verily per&s;waded, that the Merchant and

<P>When <HI>Aggrypina</HI> was come to her &s;elf, and able to &s;peak, &s;he fell upon her knees, and be&s;ought <HI>Andolocia</HI> to have mercy upon her: for that &s;he confe&s;&s;ed &s;he had greatly injured him, for which &s;he was heartily &s;orry: and it was true, it lay in his power to revenge it, but that &s;uch a revenge would &s;tain his Glorious Deed in Arms, if once it came to light, as it was mo&s;t likely it would; for, &s;aid &s;he, Murther is not rarely concealed long, the guilty con&s;cience of the Murtherer being often con&s;trained to di&s;cover it; but this did not abate <HI>Andolocia's</HI> anger, who fiercely replyed, well may you blu&s;h with &s;hame and confu&s;ion of face, &s;ince you have &s;o treacherou&s;ly dealt with one, who loved you beyond all earthly things; di&s;covering to you that &s;ecret, which all the Racks and Tortures upon Earth, could never have obliged him to have done: tremble therefore at your guilt, for &s;ee revenge is written in my brow, and upon that, he layed his hand upon his Sword; which <HI>Aggrypina</HI> perceiving, that no other, but that he intended to di&s;patch her, and therefore through fear and grief, &s;he fell into a &s;wound, which moved <HI>Andolocia</HI> to pitty; &s;o that he gently rai&s;ed her from the ground, and &s;he recovering, began to beg him to pitty her, pitty you! &s;aid <HI>Andolocia,</HI> what pitty can there remain in my bre&s;t for &s;uch an one who &s;o treacherou&s;ly and un|gratefully rewarded me for all the hazards that I underwent for your &s;ake? and know you &s;hall ware the infamy on your front, as an e|verla&s;ting Memento of your Infidelity.

At this the King greatly rejoyced, and highly honoured <HI>Andolocia,</HI> promi&s;ing all things &s;hould be done according to his directions, and de&s;ired him to make good his word without delay; upon which he took his leave of the King; and after having departed a mile from the Pallace, he put on his Wi&s;hing-Hat, and was immediately conveyed to the Nunnery, where knocking at the Gate, de&s;ired to &s;peak with the Matron, who no &s;ooner came to him, but he &s;hewed her that he was de&s;irous to &s;peak with <HI>Aggripi|na;</HI> whereupon &s;he cau&s;ed her to be called, knowing him to be the per&s;on who had brought her thither: When <HI>Aggrypina,</HI> came, &s;he could not refrain from weeping; whereupon he taking her by the hand, led her into a private Chamber, and told her, that he had been ranging the world about, to find fit Medicines to cure her of her Horns; and demanded of her, that if &s;he were cured, whither &s;he would wi&s;h her &s;elf to be?

</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHen the Earls had taken <HI>Andolocia</HI> Pri&s;oner, they carryed him to a Ca&s;tle of theirs not far from thence, where they put him into a dark Pri&s;on, and rode again to Court, carrying with them 4 fat Bucks, which they pretended to have taken by hunting. Soon after their arrival, news was brought of the death of <HI>Andolocia's</HI> men, and how that he was thought to be taken Pri&s;oner, by rea&s;on his body was not found among&s;t them, upon which, the King was exceed|ing angry; and immediately &s;ent out Me&s;&s;engers into all parts of the Kingdom; to hear of him: As likewi&s;e <HI>Ampedo</HI> offered a 1000 Duckets to any that could di&s;cover where he was; but when no ty|dings could he had where he was, he &s;uppo&s;ed him dead, or in &s;ome di&s;|mal
