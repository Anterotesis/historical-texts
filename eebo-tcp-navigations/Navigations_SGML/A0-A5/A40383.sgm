<P>IT being the u&s;ual Fate of the greate&s;t Works, as well as of the mo&s;t emi|nent Per&s;ons, to be then most de&s;ired and talked of, when the world is deprived of them; and the generality of the most curious &s;ort of Mankind loving even to tread upon that Ground which hath been most famous for any &s;ort of renowned Anti|quity; I make no question, but though (by this Lamentable Accident of Fire, which of (late hath happened in <HI>Spain</HI>) the mo&s;t Magnificent and Augu&s;t Pile of Building on the face of the Earth hath heen ruined and de&s;troyed; yet that mo&s;t that ever heard of it, by this &s;ad occa&s;ion, will talk more of it than ever before; and
<PB REF="3">many perchance as &s;hall have opportunity of travelling into tho&s;e Parts, will view with no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hment, the Ruines of this Royal Hou&s;e, than they would with curio&s;ity &s;urvey the Place where old <HI>Rome</HI> or the famous ancient <HI>Carthage</HI> &s;tood. Judging therefore, that most of tho&s;e who never had opportunity of &s;eeing this &s;o re|nowned Fabrick, may have &s;ome &s;ort of liking to hear a De&s;cription of it: 'Tis part|ly to &s;atisfie them, and partly to gratifie &s;ome Friends that have de&s;ired it of me, I have translated and taken out of a good <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Author as yet alive, and well known to the right Honourable the Earl of <HI>Sandwich,</HI> in his late Emba&s;&s;ie Extra|ordinary to the Pre&s;ent King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second (which his Lord&s;hhip executed with &s;o much Honour, Indu&s;try and Succe&s;s) this brief en&s;uing De&s;cription: the which, being not &s;o &s;ufficiently full as to contain divers things, which are not unworthy of

<HEAD><HI>The E&s;curial; OR,</HI> A De&s;cription of the Wonder of the world for Architecture and Magnificence of Structure, Built by King <HI>Philip</HI> the Se|cond of <HI>Spain;</HI> and lately Con&s;umed by Fire.</HEAD>
<P>_ALthough in a former Di&s;cour&s;e we have parti|cularly &s;hewed the principal parts of this pro|digious Piece of Architecture, and the Orna|mentals belonging to it; having u&s;ed the terms of Art, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e that are under&s;tand|ing of it; and recounted all things as in reality they are, with all clearne&s;s po&s;&s;ible, with that di&s;po&s;ition, di&s;tribution and mea&s;ure which they bear; yet notwith|&s;tanding all this, there are &s;ome per&s;ons which love not &s;uch tedious Di&s;cour&s;es; and e&s;pecially in things of this nature, which although they are plea&s;ant in the &s;eeing, yet they are trouble&s;ome in the reading: large De&s;crip|tions of them, by rea&s;on of the ob&s;curity of the terms, which in &s;uch grand Fabricks repeated &s;o often, always difficult, and ordinarily &s;trange, that even I my &s;elf am weary to write them, although I am never &s;atisfied with &s;eeing this great Wonder, that occa&s;ions me to make u&s;e of them: There are others, that at once de&s;ire
<PB N="2" REF="6">to know the greatne&s;s and di&s;tinct parts of it, and with this re&s;t &s;atisfied, being of opinion, that the goodne&s;s and rarity of it lies in the quantity and extent, ra|ther than in the quality or worth; and the largene&s;s of it is more plea&s;ing to them, than its excellency, which they under&s;tand not: Or if they do under&s;tand it, they de&s;ire to know whether there be much of that kind which mo&s;t plea&s;es their Fancies; at coming to &s;ee this Convent, encountring &s;o many beautiful Cloi&s;ters, they de&s;ire to know the number of them; they mind the beautiful di&s;po&s;ition of the Lights; they are very attentive on the Pictures and Statues; they have an infi|nite de&s;ire to know the number of them all; and the great noi&s;e that that makes, plea&s;eth them mo&s;t, and fills them with admiration; neither is this any ill humor where every thing is &s;o good as here it is. For this rea|&s;on I have re&s;olv'd, in this Di&s;cour&s;e to &s;atisfie tho&s;e that are of this temper, reducing to an exact number as near as I can, the parts of this Noble Fabrick; not only tho&s;e mentioned in my former De&s;cription, but like|wi&s;e &s;uch as were pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;ilence, or were but in general mentioned, being not of principal Concern, al|though every thing is worth taking notice of; and gi|ving likewi&s;e a brief account of the Ornaments and Furniture; together with which, making a &s;ummary Rehear&s;al of what hath been &s;aid before, for rubbing up the memories of &s;uch Arti&s;ts that &s;hall read it; and for the delight of tho&s;e that are not &s;o; to whom though they read it never &s;o often, the Terms of Archi|tecture are as difficult as <HI>Arabick.</HI> I promi&s;e to be mo&s;t faithful in this, as I have been in all the re&s;t; for it would be an infinite wrong to this Noble Edifice, not to relate what&s;oever it contains; or to think that it &s;tands in need of any Additions to heighten its great|ne&s;s;
<PB N="3" REF="6">no le&s;s than it would be to my own Profe&s;&s;ion not to &s;peak the Truth. It &s;tands as a living Te&s;timo|ny, and will for many Ages (here the Frier was no true Prophet) by which any man that &s;hall doubt, may confirm him&s;elf in the truth of the things we here re|late; and may in part &s;ee it in the very Print of the &s;ame. Pa&s;&s;ing by therefore (that which I have rela|ted in the beginning of my former De&s;cription) the Motives which the mo&s;t Catholick King <HI>Philip</HI> the Se|cond had to build this wonderful Structure, and dedicate it to the Invincible Martyr of <HI>Spain,</HI> S. <HI>Law|rence,</HI> his Protector, and Saint or Devoto; and to give it to the Order of S. <HI>Hierom;</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by likewi&s;e the Election of the Situation of it, in the Kingdom of <HI>To|ledo,</HI> &s;even Leagues di&s;tant from <HI>Madrid</HI> We&s;tward; the Platform of it, a large and va&s;t Square; the &s;ides of which contain 2980 feet; and the Maje&s;tick inclo&s;ure of the Noble Places and Gardens which compa&s;s it a|bout, and the Materials of which it is built, which is a white kind of Stone, with darki&s;h gray &s;pots in it, which beautifie it much; although in many parts of it there is Marble and Ja&s;per in abundance, and other Stones of mo&s;t per&s;picuous politene&s;s; as al&s;o the form of the Fabrick, which is all the good Orders of Archite|cture, <HI>Tu&s;can, Dorick, Ionick, Corinthian,</HI> and <HI>Compo&s;ite.</HI> Though indeed the mo&s;t of it is <HI>Dorick</HI> and <HI>Ionick;</HI> and pa&s;&s;ing al&s;o the four principal Fachadas or Sides, and the three &s;tately Gates which it hath on the We&s;t &s;ide.</P>
<P>I proceed to tell you that within this large Quadran|gle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cloy&s;ters.</NOTE> there are contained 13 Cloy&s;ters, of mo&s;t Beauti|ful Architecture, and of great extent; all which, ex|cept one, on the Back&s;ide of the great Chappel, and other two within the principal Cloy&s;ter of the Palace,
<PB N="4" REF="7">may be counted from the Draught or Print of the Hou&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> 5 on the South, &amp; 5 on the North, which, with other 2, without the Quadrangle, make in all 15: the mo&s;t of them of three Orders of Arches and Walks, others of 2, and others of 1. In which are to be &s;een &s;o many Win|dows as amount to more than 680.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Courts</HI> 9.</NOTE>Be&s;ides which, there are 9 Courts, among&s;t which, the <HI>Portico,</HI> or that which you fir&s;t enter into, is the mo&s;t Royal and Stately one in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Turrets which are rai&s;ed upon the Corners of this Square,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tmrrets.</NOTE> and on the Cro&s;&s;ings of the Cloy&s;ters, and on the Church, which may obliterate the memory of the ancient Pyramids, &s;o celebrated by Antiquity, are in number 9. Among&s;t which, is reckoned that fa|mous Cupula or Turret on the Church, 315 foot high from the Ground. The Globes or Balls that are placed on the top of them, upon which the Fanes move, all of Gilt Metal, are of 5 foot diameter; and that on the top of the Church of &s;even foot, in&s;omuch that a man of good Stature, may &s;tand upright in it with both Arms extended out.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Windows &amp; Doors.</NOTE>The Windows which are &s;een on the out&s;ide, before you enter the hou&s;e, are 1110; di&s;tributed with much U|niformity &amp; Order; many of them with whole Balconies, others with Brea&s;t high all of Iron, and well Glazed, which gives a great Lu&s;tre and Maje&s;ty to the Fabrick. Tho&s;e which are to be &s;een within in the great Court or <HI>Portico,</HI> Cloy&s;ters, Courts, Towers, and other places, even ro the top of the Hou&s;e, are 1578. So that the whole number of them doth come unto 2688. with the Shuts of them, of a plea&s;ing green colour, both for the pre&s;ervation of them, and Beauty of the Edifice. If to the&s;e we add the Windows of the Out-Offices, they amount unto few le&s;s than 4000. The Doors reckoned after the &s;ame manner, are in number 8000. The outward Gates in the four &s;ides of the Hou&s;e are
<PB N="5" REF="7">16, entring through any of which, you &s;eem to come into a Labyrinth; e&s;pecially in the Palace, where by the multiplicity of them, the Multiplicity of them, the cunninge&s;t man alive may ea&s;ily lo&s;e him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The <HI>Zaquanes</HI> or Portals at the entrance of the princi|cipal Gates, &amp; &s;ome others at the entrance of the noble Apartments are 14, all of very con&s;iderable Archite|cture.</P>
<P>The Fountains in the Center of the Cloy&s;ters and Courts, for the refre&s;hment of the whole Hou&s;e, the water of which is carried through the va&s;t extent of it, together with tho&s;e in the Church, Gardens, Offices, and all places where there is occa&s;ion for them, come to about four&s;core and &s;ix; together with eleven Ci&s;terns; that it is a doubt whether <HI>Madrid</HI> it &s;elf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Stairs.</NOTE> though very plentifully watered, hath &s;o many or not.</P>
<P>The &s;everal Stairs to go up and down, and to pa&s;s to and again in the Cloy&s;ters and other Apartments, are about 80. among&s;t which, there are &s;ome of admi|rable Invention, and very many of a great number of Steps, very plea&s;ant and ea&s;ie to a&s;cend.</P>
<P>The Galleries, Halls, Chambers, Cells, Offices, &amp; other Apartments, are &s;o many, that it &s;eems impo&s;&s;i|ble to count them; however, I &s;hall do my endeavour to give a &s;ufficient accompt of them, reckoning for the ea&s;ier proceeding by the difference of Habi|tations in this Fabrick, <HI>viz.</HI> it contains one Convent, two Colledges, the one of Religious, the other of Seculars, and the Palace Royal. All which are &s;o ca|pacious, and &s;o well furni&s;hed within them&s;elves, both of common and particular Rooms, that the &s;everal &s;orts of Inhabitants, though very numerous, find ex|cellent accommodation in them.</P>
<P>The King with his whole Hou&s;e, the Queen, and all the Royal Family in the Palace; and yet it is known that the Train which they ordinarily bring with
<PB N="6" REF="8">them gives care enough to the mo&s;t populous Cities to entertain them.</P>
<P>There are about 150 Religious in the Convent, 50 more in the Colledge, and as many more Seculars in the Seminary, either Graduates or under Graduates, from whence may be inferr'd what Chambers, Lodgings, Cells, &amp;c. are required for &s;o great a number of inha|bitants, but there are moreover and above in the Pa|lace, be&s;ides the Rooms of State for the Noble men and Ladies, in the Kings, Queens, and Infanta's apartments, eight Galleries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Galleries in the Pa|lace <HI>8.</HI></NOTE> be&s;ides lodging rooms.</P>
<P>In the Convent and Colledges, there are likewi&s;e large &s;tately Roomes of this kind, but differenced by their names, occa&s;ioned either from bu&s;ine&s;s done in them, or things that are there laid up. There are three Capitulos or Chapter hou&s;es, three Libraries, five great Halls,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the con|vent and Colledge.</NOTE> &s;ix Dormitories, three Halls in the Ho&s;|pital, and four others which &s;erve for divers offices; all very large and equall as it were for length and breadth. The which with divers others for walks and entertain|ments make in all thirty.</P>
<P>The Oratories and Chappels which are (without the principal Church) di&s;tributed through the&s;e &s;everal ha|bitations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oratories.</NOTE> counting with them that of the old Church and that of the offices of the palace, are &s;even of excel|lent Symmetry and Elegance.</P>
<P>The Refectories or Eating places in the Convent, Colledge, Seminaries, &amp;c. are in all nine, very large and neat.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Refecto|ries <HI>9.</HI> Infirme|rias.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Infirmerias or places to receive the Sick, are in all five, with great variety of Chambers in them, pla|ced with &s;uch re&s;pect to their Chappels, that the Sick may hear Ma&s;s as they lye in their beds.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="8">
<P>The Botica, or Apothecaries apartment hath five or &s;ix admirable rooms, be&s;ides others, which make of it a large hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The Ho&s;pedarias or places for entertainment of Strangers are two,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ho&s;ped.</NOTE> the one is within the hou&s;e with large dining rooms, and decent Chambers for enter|tainment of Strangers, the which are attended by young Youths that are Students; the other is without, with all manner likewi&s;e of accommodation.</P>
<P>The Kitchins of the Palace Convent and Colledges are in all nine,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cocin.</NOTE> and as many hou&s;es of Office.</P>
<P>The Rooms which are under the hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cellars.</NOTE> by who&s;e &s;trong Arches the whole is &s;u&s;tained, are above forty, large and light&s;ome, and of very beautiful Architecture, and that &s;erve for many offices, as the Caterers, Plate-keepers, &amp;c. There are others likewi&s;e for di&s;tributi|on of the Fountain Pipes, which are divided up and down in the&s;e Cellars, where there are likewi&s;e eleven Ci&s;terns, the lea&s;t of which holds 10000 quarts of Water.</P>
<P>The Lofts and little rooms on the hou&s;e top all co|vered with Slat,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lofts.</NOTE> and joyn'd in form of a Grid Iron.</P>
<P>All the&s;e parts are included in this prodigious build|ing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Church.</NOTE> be&s;ides the Church and <HI>Sacri&s;tia,</HI> or Repo&s;itory of Reliques and Sacredotal Ve&s;tments, where there are many more of great extent and amplitude. For the Church which is in length 374 feet, and 230 in breadth, includes the great Chappel, the Quire, the under Quire, divers other Chappels, the Antiquires, and fortyeight Altars and other pieces, which of them&s;elves alone are &s;ufficient objects of admiration.</P>
<P>It hath &s;even extraordinary great and beautiful I&s;les, in the top of which are &s;een twenty &s;ix Arches, and o|ver them large empty &s;paces, in like manner, as there is under the Floor of it.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="9">
<P>The <HI>Sacri&s;tia</HI> being very large and capacious, con|&s;i&s;ts of eight &s;tately rooms, be&s;ides divers others very con&s;iderable and great,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sacri&s;tia.</NOTE> for the u&s; of tho&s;e that mini|&s;ter about them, which are indeed but all requi&s;ite for this wonder of the World.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the parts &s;o far as I can reckon them of this miraculous Fabrick; the whole Machine contains the&s;e Rooms and apartments in it, and to tell in one word the Multitude, and High grandure of them, if one would go through all of them, and the whole &s;pace contain'd in the Hou&s;e and Offices belonging to it, it would take up four whole days to doe it, it being a journey of thirty three mea&s;ured leagues, or ninety nine miles, &s;o va&s;t and large is this curious piece. I come now to the number of the Ornaments of Furni|ture, which exceedingly beautifies and enriches this &s;tately Edifice.</P>
<P>I fay therefore that the &s;tatues which are in it which may well compare for beauty and Grandure with the mo&s;t celebrated <HI>Colo&s;&s;us</HI>'s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Statues.</NOTE> of the Ancients are in all fifty and one, thirteen of Stone, and thirty eight of mettal, richly guilt, and almo&s;t all of them much bigger then the life, &s;ome of them two or three times bigger, which give an exceeding great Maje&s;ty to the Fronti&s;piece, the Portico or fir&s;t great Court, the Church and principal Cloy&s;ter, into which they are di&s;tribu|ted, the names of the Ma&s;ters which wrought them are down in the annexed Catalogue.</P>
<P>Other le&s;s pieces, as Crucifixes, Pictures of St. <HI>Je|rome</HI> of St. <HI>John Bapti&s;t,</HI> and likewi&s;e of our Lady, which are placed in divers Cells, and other parts of the Hou&s;e of ine&s;timable Sculpture (without taking notice now of tho&s;e in the Church) doe amount unto fifty, wrought on divers materials, even to Porphery it &s;elf.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="9">
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pictures in Oyl co|lours and Fre&s;co.</NOTE>The Pictures in Oyle colours and in <HI>Fre&s;co</HI> which ennoble and give a kind of awfull Maje&s;ty to the &s;e|veral places before mentioned, are very many, I &s;hall give you the &s;umm of tho&s;e that are of greate&s;t worth and value, they are in General 1622 Pictures of the life and Hi&s;tory, all in oyle colours, di&s;tributed up and down the whole hou&s;e; and although they be not all of them of the rare&s;t and greate&s;t value, yet there is not one of them which is not very well worth our ad|miration. I reckon not at all of the more ordinary &s;ort which &s;erve onely to cover the walls. The greater part of them are originalls, and many of them of the mo&s;t famous and celebrated Ma&s;ters, as of <HI>Ma&s;acio, Rafaell, Sancio, &V;rbino, Leonardo de vinci, Titian,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ma&s;ters.</NOTE> <HI>Bordo|nan Seba&s;tian del piombo, Andreas del Sarto, Paulo Vero|ne&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Carolos Verone&s;e,</HI> his Son, <HI>Jacobo Robu&s;to</HI> or <HI>Tintoretto, Ba&s;an, Geronimo Muciano, Parme&s;ano, An|tonio Acorego</HI> or <HI>Corregio.

Every one of the&s;e Pillars co&s;t ten thou&s;and Ducats, and in all four&s;core thou&s;and. But the mo&s;t pretious Jewel of all, is, the le&s;&s;er <HI>Cu&s;todia,</HI>

The doors of the <HI>Sagrario,</HI> or <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum,</HI> are of the fine&s;t Ja&s;per, and brighte&s;t Bra&s;s, and the place it &s;elf a mo&s;t Heavenly piece. The two Royal E&s;cutcheons which are on the &s;ides of the Chap|pel, over the Kings Tombs, are all of Ja&s;per, very rich and pretious, with very &s;ignificant devi&s;es. The 40 Altars which are di&s;per&s;ed up and down the Body of the Church, be&s;ides divers others, have &s;everal changes of Frontalls or Ornamental Coverings, for every day if need require, and for the &s;everal Fe&s;tivals and Holy|days there are &s;everal &s;uits of Attirements uniform in co|lour and fa&s;hion, and for this purpo&s;e they are kept, &s;ome in the <HI>Sacri&s;tia,</HI> and others in Che&s;ts neer unto the Altars.</P>
<P>The high Altar, and the two Altars called the Altars <HI>de Reliquias</HI> or Reliques, are riche&s;t in this &s;ort.

Be&s;ides which every Altar hath one of a great number of branches, which are lighted immediately before the Con&s;ecration at Ma&s;s, they are in all 40.</P>
<P>The Cro&s;&s;es which are placed upon the&s;e Altars, with their Crucifixes of Bra&s;s and Silver are in number one hundred, and that which is the Grandure of all the&s;e Altars, is, that they are all con&s;ecrated, in&s;omuch that all the Tables of them are Altars, and every one of them hath placed within it a Box of Reliques, of the &s;ame Saint to whom the Altar is Dedicated.</P>
<P>To denote that the whole Church is con&s;ecrated, there are twelve Cro&s;&s;es &s;et up in &s;everal places of it, where the Unction was made at Con&s;ecration, one of which is of the mo&s;t beautiful Ja&s;per, upon a White
<PB N="14" REF="12">Marble, which is a great Ornament unto it.

When all the&s;e are lighted together with the Candles upon the Altars, and Luminaries placed in all the more emi|nent parts of the Church, as they u&s;e to do at the fir&s;t Reception of Kings and Queens, and other Solemn Oc|ca&s;ions and Fe&s;tivals, it looks like a very Heaven upon Earth.</P>
<P>The Organs throughout the whole Church are in number 8;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Organs.</NOTE> which both beautifie it with their out|ward Lu&s;tre, the Lofts being all gilt; and enliven it with their Divine Melody. There is one all of Silver, extraordinary rich, which is plaid upon every <HI>Corpus Chri&s;ti</HI> Day.</P>
<P>The Bells of the Towers are in all 59. forty of which are in very tunable Chimes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bells.</NOTE> and have their Keys like Organs, which makes a plea&s;ant Mu&s;ick to play up|on them.</P>
<P>The Reliques which arc kept in the &s;everal <HI>Relicarios,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reliques.</NOTE> or Places appointed for them, which are very Maje&s;tick and Augu&s;t, are &s;o many, that even from our Saviour, and the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, there are Reliques of all the Saints celebrated in the Church, except S. <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> and S. <HI>John</HI> the Evangeli&s;t; yea, there are even to the ve|ry Prophets before the coming of Chri&s;t into the world, the Boxes and Ve&s;&s;els in which with great veneration they are kept in number 515, &s;ome of Gold, &s;ome of Silver, &s;ome of Chry&s;tal, and other Precious Stones.</P>

The number of the Seats is 128. in a double Row: The Divine Ser|vice which is here celebrated, is more ravi&s;hing than whatever is to be &s;een in the Hou&s;e.
