<HEAD>A brief De&s;cription of the Seven Provinces OF THE UNITED NETHERLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>_THe <HI>&V;nited Netherlands</HI> is part of <HI>Belgia</HI> or <HI>Lower Germany;</HI> bounded on the Ea&s;t with <HI>We&s;tphalia,</HI> on the We&s;t with the <HI>North Sea,</HI> on the North with <HI>Embdenland,</HI> and on the South with <HI>Flan|ders</HI> and <HI>Brabant.</HI></P>
<P>It con&s;i&s;ts of the Provinces of <HI>Gelderland, Hol|and, Zealand, Frie&s;land, &V;trecht, Overy&s;&s;el, Zutphen</HI> and <HI>Groen|nghen,</HI> part of <HI>Brabant</HI> and part of <HI>Flanders.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Provinces are called the <HI>&V;nited Netherlands,</HI> from an Agreement and Contract made among them&s;elves in the year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">571, to throw off their Subjection and Allegiance to the King of <HI>Spain</HI> their Soveraign Lord, and to unite all their Power and Force again&s;t him.</P>
<P>But though they thus united their Power, yet are all the&s;e Provinces, yea and mo&s;t of their Cities in each Province, di&s;tinct Commonwealths of them&s;elves, and governed by Laws and Cu&s;toms different from each other. Only for managing of Publique Affairs, each Province and City of note &s;ends their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">tates or Tru&s;tees to the <HI>Hague,</HI> where they debate Affairs in a Parliamentary order. And the&s;e States thus a&s;&s;embled, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 letter">alled the <HI>States General,</HI> or, as they &s;tile them&s;elves, <HI>The High and Mighty States of the &V;nited Netherlands.</HI></P>
<P>In Councel with the&s;e States &s;ate formerly the Prince of <HI>O|range,</HI> General of their Armies, who for his many Services done again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ince their fore&s;aid Revolt, was by them made Stadt-holder, Admiral of the Seas, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and al|lowed in their A&s;&s;embly a double Voice; which Offices and
<PB N="4" REF="3">Titles have &s;ince de&s;cended to his Heirs the Succe&s;&s;ive Princes of <HI>Orange.</HI> But in the year 16 Faction and Jealou&s;ie &s;ugge&s;ted to &s;ome Leading Men in their Councels, that &s;o much Authority was not fit to be inve&s;ted in a Sngle Per&s;on, le&s;t by his Power he &s;hould change their Commonwealth into a Monarchy, and of Free States make them all his Subjects. To prevent which danger, they Voted that the General&s;hip belonged not to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> as his Right, but their Courte&s;ie; and made an Edict, that for the future there &s;hould be no more Stadt-hol|der; and cau&s;ed all the States General to take an Oath to ob|&s;erve this Edict inviolably. Nay, when this pre&s;ent Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> in the year 16 was made General of their Armies, they cau&s;ed him to &s;wear never to accept of the Office of Stadt-hol|der. But this &s;eems only the humour of the <HI>Hogen Mogens,</HI> and not the voice of the People: for they remembring the many good Offices of his Forefathers done for the State, cry out again&s;t the&s;e proceedings with him; and taking an advantage of the pre&s;ent troubles their Country is in, in a tumultuous manner force the States to abjure their former Edict, and ab&s;olve the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> of his fore&s;aid Oath, and make him their Stadt-holder, Amiral, Di&s;po&s;er of the Militia, and in their A&s;&s;emblies to have a double Voice, as his Forefathers had. But to the De&s;cription of the Country; and Fir&s;t</P>

<HEAD><HI>Of</HI> Gelderland.</HEAD>
<P>THe Land now called <HI>Gelderland,</HI> or <HI>Gelve,</HI> was formerly called <HI>Ponthis;</HI> and had from <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperour the additional name <HI>De Caluwe.</HI> It was fir&s;t made a Lord&s;hip in the year 878. Its fir&s;t Lord (as <HI>Guicciardine</HI> relates) was <HI>Win|chard van Pont,</HI> who with his Brother <HI>Leopold</HI> built the Ca&s;tle <HI>Pont-Gelve,</HI> which now is the City of <HI>Gelder,</HI> and gives name to the whole Province. It is a &s;trong City.</P>
<P>This Province is begirt in the North with the Land of <HI>Overy&s;&s;el</HI> and the <HI>South-Sea;</HI> On the South, in part with the <HI>Ma&s;e</HI> and the Lord&s;hip of <HI>Gulicb;</HI> in the We&s;t with the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and part of <HI>Cleveland;</HI> and in the Ea&s;t with the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>&V;trecht.</HI> It
<PB N="5" REF="3">is a plain Country, with few Hills, but many delightful and profitable Woods, as that of <HI>Echterwalt</HI> to the Northwe&s;t of <HI>Aernhem,</HI> and &s;everal others. The Soyl is generally very fruit|ful, particularly of Corn; and in many places, e&s;pecially about the <HI>Rhine, Ma&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Wael,</HI> excellent Meadows for feeding of Cattle, which there are kept in great abundance.</P>
<P>In this Dakedom (be&s;ides that of <HI>Zutphen</HI> and its &s;even Vil|lages, which is an Earldom of it &s;elf, and therefore &s;hall be di&s;|cour&s;ed in its proper place) are numbred fifteen walled Cities; as <HI>Nimmegen, Aernhem,</HI> and <HI>Reurmond,</HI> the three head-Cities; then <HI>Tiel, Bommel, Harderwijck, Wageninghen, Hattem, Elburg, Gelder, Venlo, Wachten, Douck, Stralen,</HI> and <HI>Erckelens.</HI> There are &s;everal other Towns in the Dukedom of <HI>Gelder,</HI> and Earl|dom of <HI>Zutphen,</HI> that have been formerly walled; but by &s;eve|ral accidents have wholly or in part lo&s;t their Walls, but yet re|tain their ancient Priviledges, as <HI>Batenburgh, Gent, Montfort, Echt, Burgh, Keppel,</HI> and &s;everal others. There are moreover above 300 Villages with Pari&s;h-Churches.</P>
<P>The States of the Dukedom of <HI>Gelder,</HI> and Earldom of <HI>Zut|phen,</HI> con&s;i&s;t of the Barons, Gentry, and the four head-Cities a|fore&s;aid, <HI>viz. Nimmegen, Aerahem, Reurmond,</HI> and <HI>Zutphen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nimmegen</HI> was formerly called <HI>Magus,</HI> from one <HI>Magus</HI> King of <HI>Gallia;</HI> but afterwards when one <HI>Bato</HI> King of the <HI>Katts</HI> came into the Land, and being delighted as well with the con|venience of its &s;cituation as the antiquity of the Place, he rebuilt and enlarged this almo&s;t-ruin'd City, and fortified it with three &s;trong Walls, and called the City <HI>Nava Magen;</HI> which name be length of time is now altered into <HI>Nimmegen.</HI> Our Author tells us al&s;o, that the <HI>Betuwers,</HI> which he calls <HI>Bataviers,</HI> cho&s;e this City for the Metropolis and chief Seat of their Kingdom; from whence the Land about it is at this day called the Kingdom of <HI>Nimmegen;</HI> and the City it &s;elf by Latine Authors <HI>Pes Im|perii,</HI> becau&s;e, as &s;ome write, <HI>Charles</HI> the Great advanced it to the dignity of one of the three Royal Cities of the&s;e Lands: <HI>Aken</HI> being the Fir&s;t, <HI>this</HI> the Second, and <HI>Theonville</HI> in the Land of <HI>Lutzenburg</HI> the Third.</P>
<P><HI>Nimmegen</HI> lies upon an arm of the <HI>Rhine</HI> called the <HI>Wael,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="4">which there is very wide and deep. It is a great, &s;trong, and populous City, who&s;e Inhabitants after they came under the <HI>Oo&s;tenrijk</HI> Princes, much addicted them&s;elves to Learning and Merchandi&s;e, when as before they only followed the Wars. The chief Church in this City is dedicated to the honour of St. <HI>Ste|phen</HI> the fir&s;t Martyr.</P>
<P>Among the ancient Buildings of this City, the chief is the Ca&s;tle, &s;cituate upon the top of an high Hill, from whence the whole City is di&s;covered. This is held to be built by <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> who by the means of this Ca&s;tle intended to keep the Country about it in &s;ubjection to his power. In and about this City hath been found for &s;everal years la&s;t pa&s;t, many Antiqui|ties of the ancient <HI>Romans,</HI> even as about the banks of the <HI>Wael</HI> &s;everal Remnants and Ruines of <HI>Roman</HI> Fortifications are to be &s;een at this day; from whence tho&s;e Places are yet called the <HI>Roman Footing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nimmegen</HI> is a City-Earldom, a free City, a member of the Kingdom, and Coyns money by their own Authority, and therefore makes no appeals to the Chancery of <HI>Gelderland,</HI> but at the fir&s;t in&s;tance only to <HI>Aken:</HI> wherefore the Citizens of this City, as an acknowledgment of their &s;uperiority in the Com|monwealth, &s;end yearly a Glove full of Pepper; which is all the Tax they contribute towards the Publique charges. Yet doth not this Priviledge of theirs dimini&s;h the Authority of the States of <HI>Gelder,</HI> but they have likewi&s;e power to Coyn Money, and have the &s;ame Juri&s;diction in this City as in other Cities of <HI>Gelderland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nimmegen</HI> came under the Power of the Dukedom of <HI>Gelders</HI> in the year 1248, by this means. Earl <HI>Otto</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>Gel|der</HI> lent <HI>William</HI> Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> and King of <HI>Rome</HI> 21000 Mark of Silver, on condition that if he repaid it not again on a &s;et day, that then this City and its Appurtenances &s;hould be forfeit to him. This condition the Emperour <HI>Rodoiphus</HI> the fir&s;t confirmed. And becau&s;e the money was not accordingly re&s;tored, <HI>Nimmegen</HI> was incorporate into the Dukedom of <HI>Gel|derland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aerenhem</HI> is by <HI>Cornelius Taeitus</HI> and other ancient Writers
<PB N="7" REF="4">called <HI>Arenacum.</HI> It lies on the right &s;ide of the <HI>Rhine,</HI> about a mile and half from the place where it divides it &s;elf into two branches, between <HI>Nimmegen</HI> and <HI>Doesburg,</HI> which lie each 6 miles from thence. It is a pretty, large, and well-built City, with fair and well-ornamented Churches in it, the chief of which is dedicated to the honour of S. <HI>Eu&s;ebius,</HI> in which Church lies buried <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t Duke of <HI>Gelderland,</HI> who died in the year 1538; after who&s;e death, he dying without i&s;&s;ue, the Dukedom of <HI>Gelderland</HI> and Earldom of <HI>Zutphen</HI> de|&s;cended by Contract to the afore&s;aid Emperour and his lawful Heirs, as Dukes of <HI>Brahant</HI> and Earls of <HI>Holland.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Aernhem</HI> us'd in ancient times to be the general place of re&s;i|dence of the Dukes of <HI>Gelders.</HI> It was fir&s;t compa&s;&s;ed with Walls, and endowed with City-Priviledges by <HI>Otto</HI> the third of <HI>Na&s;&s;ow,</HI> Duke of <HI>Gelderland.</HI></P>
<P>Here re&s;ides the Provincial Court or Chancery of the&s;e two Countries, con&s;i&s;ting of a Chancellour and ten Judges; four of which are of the greate&s;t Nobility of the Land, from each Quarter or Circuit one: The other &s;ix are of Per&s;ons learned in the Law. From the Decrees of this Chancery there is no appeal: yet upon &s;ome Grounds another hearing may be had. Moreover, <HI>Philip</HI> the &s;econd King of <HI>Spain,</HI> as Duke of <HI>Gelder,</HI> erected in <HI>Aernhem</HI> a Chamber of Accounts, con&s;i&s;ting of two Accountants, an Audi|tor, and a Secretary. At this Chamber of Accounts mu&s;t all the Officers (both Civil and Military) of the Commonwealth of <HI>Gelder</HI> and <HI>Zutphen</HI> give up the Accounts of their Tru&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>Aernhem</HI> is the Head-City of the fourth quarter of the Go|vernment of <HI>Gelder, viz.</HI> the Quarter called the <HI>Veluwe;</HI> and hath incorporated with it <HI>Wageningen, Hattem, Harderwijck,</HI> and <HI>Elburg,</HI> all walled Cities, be&s;ides &s;everal Villages that keep Courts of Judicature, but with appeal to the upper Courts of this Circuit afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>The <HI>Veluwe</HI> is a &s;mall Country begirt on three&s;ides with the South Sea, and on the fourth with the <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Y&s;&s;el;</HI> &s;o that it is a place both excellent and profitable for Fi&s;hing, and is be&s;ide rea&s;onably well provided of Woods and Forre&s;t full of Game.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5">
<P>By <HI>Aernhem</HI> lies another neck of Land called the <HI>Veluwe-Zoom,</HI> and extends on one &s;ide as far as <HI>Zutphen,</HI> and on the o|ther &s;ide about <HI>Wagener;</HI> which is all Meadow-Grounds, and well furni&s;hed with &s;tore of Cattle.</P>
<P>At the mouth of the River <HI>Ruer,</HI> or <HI>Roer</HI> (which mingles with the <HI>Ma&s;e</HI>) lies the City <HI>Ruermond,</HI> from whence it takes its name; which commonly for &s;hortne&s;s is called <HI>Remond;</HI> a fair and rich City, and as well for its &s;cituation, natural accommo|dations, and Populou&s;ne&s;s, is a &s;trong Place; who&s;e chief Church is Dedicated to the honour of the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and Dig|nified with the Title of a Cathedral.</P>
<P><HI>Ruermond</HI> is the Head-City of the &s;econd Quarter of <HI>Gelder|land,</HI> and to it belongs <HI>Venlo, Gelder, Stralen, Wachtendonck,</HI> and <HI>Erckelens;</HI> with the Freedoms of <HI>Monford, Echt,</HI> and <HI>Niewer&s;tat,</HI> lying about four Miles di&s;tant from one another; as al&s;o that of <HI>Ke&s;&s;el, Midler,</HI> and <HI>Krecken&s;teel,</HI> belonging to its par|ticular Lords. It is a fair Village, and hath belonging to it a &s;trong Ca&s;tle &s;eated upon a Hill. This Village takes its name from the &s;mall circumjacent Country called <HI>Ke&s;&s;el,</HI> which be|longs to the Dukedom.</P>
<P>The &s;maller Towns of <HI>Gelderland</HI> we &s;hall briefly run over. As <HI>Hattem,</HI> a little, but &s;trong Town, having a Ca&s;tle who&s;e Walls are 24 foot thick; lying on the left hand of the <HI>Y&s;&s;el,</HI> a|bout 8 Miles from <HI>Elburg.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Elburg</HI> is a little Town; It lies on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> 8 Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Harderwijck.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Harderwijck</HI> lies on the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> 20 Miles from <HI>Wagenin|gen;</HI> formerly a Village, but made a Town, and walled about, in the year 1229, by Earl <HI>Otto</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>Gelderland,</HI> who al&s;o walled <HI>Aernhem, Bommel, Ruermond, Goch,</HI> and <HI>Wageningen;</HI> formerly all Villages, but by him made Towns. In this Town is by the States of <HI>Gelder</HI> and <HI>Zutphen</HI> a famous School erected, wherein is read Philo&s;ophy and Divinity, but neither Law nor Phy&s;ick.</P>
<P><HI>Wageningen</HI> is a &s;mall, but &s;trong Town, and very Ancient, if it be the &s;ame (as it is held) which <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> calls <HI>Vada.</HI> It lies 8 Miles from <HI>Aernhem,</HI> and as much from <HI>Nimmegen.</HI></P>
<PB N="9" REF="5">
<P><HI>Tiel</HI> lies on the right &s;ide of the <HI>Wael,</HI> 8 Miles from <HI>Bommel;</HI> is a good &s;trong Town, who&s;e power and juri&s;diction reaches all over the little I&s;land wherein it lies, and from who&s;e name the I&s;land it &s;elf is called the <HI>World of Tiel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bommel</HI> lies on the left &s;ide of the <HI>Wael.</HI> It is a good &s;trong Town, and Head of that I&s;land, which from it is called <HI>Bommel-weerd.</HI> This I&s;le is made of the <HI>Rhine</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;e,</HI> which together encompa&s;s it, and, as <HI>Guicciardine</HI> &s;uppo&s;es, is the &s;ame that <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> where he treats of the <HI>Mo&s;e</HI> calls the <HI>I&s;le of Bataviers.</HI> In this I&s;land are many fair Villages, and particularly <HI>Ro&s;&s;em,</HI> the Birth-place of that famous Warriour <HI>Martin van Ro&s;&s;em.</HI> At this time <HI>Bommel</HI> is accounted one of the be&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t fron|tier Towns of the <HI>&V;nited Netherlands:</HI> As al&s;o is that &s;trong Fortification</P>
<P><HI>St. Andies,</HI> which lies above <HI>Ro&s;&s;em</HI> in the Penin&s;ula, which can with its Bulwarks command both the <HI>Wael</HI> and the <HI>Ma&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stralen</HI> is a &s;mall, but &s;trong Town, and lies about 6 Miles from <HI>Wachtendonck.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Venlo</HI> lies about 6 Miles on the right hand of the <HI>Mo&s;e.</HI> It is a good and &s;trong Town, where in the year 1543 the Duke of <HI>Clove</HI> delivered him&s;elf to <HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, together with all his right and preten&s;ions to the Dukedom of <HI>Gelderland</HI> and Earldom of <HI>Zutphen;</HI> to which the E&s;tates of the Land al&s;o a|greed. It was taken in the year 1632 by the States of the <HI>&V;ni|ted Netherlands,</HI> under the Conduct of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> as al&s;o was <HI>Stralen</HI> and <HI>Ruermond.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wachtendonck</HI> lies upon the banck of the River <HI>Niers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Elekelens</HI> lies upon the Frontiers of the Dukedom of <HI>Gulick,</HI> about 4 Miles from <HI>Ruermond.</HI> The Soyl about it is very fruit|ful of good Wheat and other Grain, in&s;omuch that the Inha|bitants addict them&s;elves mo&s;t to Husbandry.</P>
<P>The&s;e being all the walled Cities and Towns of <HI>Gelderland,</HI> we &s;hould here end this Di&s;cour&s;e: but in regard the Earldoms of <HI>Kuylenburg</HI> and <HI>Buren</HI> are pretended to belong to the Go|vernment of <HI>Gelder,</HI> and are however Members of it, we &s;hall briefly touch at them.</P>
<P><HI>Kuylenburg</HI> is a fair Town, who&s;e Command and Juri&s;diction
<PB N="10" REF="6">hath a large extent. It lies, on the le&s;t &s;ide of the water-&s;tood Lacke, four Miles from <HI>Boren.</HI> It was rai&s;ed to an Earldom by King <HI>Philip</HI> the Second of <HI>Spain,</HI> and by him endowed with great Priviledges.</P>
<P><HI>Buren</HI> is no Member of <HI>Gelder,</HI> and yet lies within the Duke|dom. The City lies by the Flood <HI>Linge,</HI> four Miles from <HI>Tiel.</HI> It hath a Ca&s;tle 1360 Paces in compa&s;s; on it four Towers, and about it three double Moats. It bears al&s;o the name of an Earldom, and hath juri&s;diction over many Villages and con&s;i|derable derable quantity of Grounds. It belongs to the Prince of <HI>O|range.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Earldom of <HI>Holland.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SOme Writers &s;uppo&s;e it is called <HI>Holland</HI> from <HI>Holt,</HI> which in the <HI>Germane</HI> Language &s;ignifies <HI>Wood;</HI> becau&s;e in An|cient times, as they &s;ay, <HI>Holland</HI> was much overgrown with Woods. Others draw the name from the lowne&s;s and hollow|ne&s;s of the Land. Others think it was called <HI>Hoyland,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>Hayland.</HI> But the learned <HI>Junius</HI> is of another Opi|nion: For he believes that <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> were Colonies of the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Danes;</HI> who leaving their I&s;lands <HI>Oland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> in the <HI>Sound,</HI> called the&s;e &s;o in remembrance of their own; as We and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have lately done in <HI>America</HI> by <HI>New England</HI> and <HI>New Spain,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The circumference of this Country is about 240 Miles; but its bredth &s;uch, that a man &s;tanding in the middle of it might travel out of its bounds in three hours time. This Country is very fruitful for Corn, although not imployed to that produce. But the Land is u&s;ed for Meadows for Pa&s;turage of Cattle, in which the Soyl is incredibly rich, and brings up the be&s;t and large&s;t Cows, which do afford in a Summers day 11 quarts of Milk apiece: So that <HI>John Benning</HI> is of opinion, that in the Village of <HI>A&s;&s;endelft,</HI> and four other circumjacent Villages, is more Milk given, then there comes Rheni&s;h-wine to <HI>Dort</HI> from all <HI>Germany.</HI> Of their great abundance of Milk they make mo&s;t excellent Butter, fit for the Palats of Princes; be&s;ides
<PB N="11" REF="6">great numbers of Chee&s;es, which for their worth may well compare either with them of <HI>Placencia,</HI> or tho&s;e cal|led <HI>Parma&s;an.</HI> The choice are tho&s;e of <HI>Texel</HI> and <HI>Grave|land,</HI> next tho&s;e of <HI>Edam,</HI> e&s;pecially when they grow &s;o me what old.</P>
<P>This Country brings up very gallant Hor&s;es; And in the Sand-downs are an incredible number of Coneys. Here is al&s;o plenty of Harts, Hindes, and Hares; and particularly in the <HI>Hagues</HI> Woods are a great number of <HI>Roe-deer.</HI></P>
<P>Neither is here any want of Poultrey, e&s;pecially of Gee&s;e, Ducks, and Snipes. For Fuel here are Fens, which together with their Ditches afford abundance of Turf.</P>

It hath in it many &s;mall Woods very profitable to the Inhabitants; and ten places that are indowed with large priviledges; as namely, <HI>Meppen, Geelmuyden, Coevorden, Hardenberge, Omme, Almeloo, Goor, Diepenhem, Delden,</HI> and <HI>En|&s;chede.</HI> It hath eight walled Cities, and above two hundred Villages; among which, &s;ome are very great and fair ones. It con&s;i&s;ts of two E&s;tates: the fir&s;t, of the Officers and Gentry; the other, of the three Cities <HI>Deventer, Campen,</HI> and <HI>Swolle.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Deventer</HI> is a good and rea&s;onable big City, and very &s;trong; full of fair Hou&s;es, and many publique Buildings; well inhabited, and full of People. On the North-we&s;t it lies on a &s;andy Hill, but all the re&s;t of the City is encompa&s;&s;ed with fair low Meadows, which o|verflow with the upper waters. The <HI>Y&s;&s;el</HI> running along the Key or Wharf on one &s;ide, &s;erves it as a Moat. The other &s;ides of it are &s;trengthened in part with a deep Moat, and in part with a broad Haven. Its walls are high, and thick &s;et with Towers, and many
<PB N="21" REF="11">Bulwarks, and other &s;trong Fortifications. It is a City of great Trade, by rea&s;on that it and the two other chief Cities of this Country have had an ancient confederacy with the Han&s;e or <HI>Aen|zce</HI> Towns, and were in the year 1495 put into the number of the free Imperial Cities, and endowed with many large Priviledges.</P>
<P><HI>Campen</HI> (though it be accounted in <HI>Overy&s;&s;el,</HI> yet it lies on this &s;ide the <HI>Y&s;&s;el</HI>) is a great and fair City, and well Traded: yet for|merly, before the waters were grown &s;o &s;hallow, it had a far greater Trade than now. It is well fortified with Walls, Towers, Moats and Bulwarks. It lies low on the Wa&s;h of the River, which is very broad in that place; which is a great &s;trength to the City, becau&s;e the Citizens can when they plea&s;e, &s;et it under water. In the mid|dle of it there is a fair &s;trong Bridge over the River, who&s;e Locks are 90 Foot wide.</P>
<P>Some think this was the Road of <HI>Ptolomies</HI> Ships: Others hold it to be the Port or Haven of <HI>Manarmanis.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Zwol</HI> lies on a Rivolet which falls into the <HI>Vider</HI> or <HI>Vecht.</HI> It is a good and &s;trong City, having double Moats and Walls. This City for its &s;trength u&s;ed to be the retreat and refuge of tho&s;e of <HI>Vollenhove,</HI> the common re&s;idence of the Governour and Councel of <HI>Overy&s;&s;el</HI> in all times of War and Danger.</P>
<P><HI>Vollenhoven</HI> lies upon the South-Sea. A good city, and well fur|ni&s;h'd by Water and Land with all nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions. Here re|&s;ides, as afore&s;aid, the Provincial Councel of <HI>Overy&s;&s;el,</HI> from who&s;e Decrees there is no Appeal.</P>
<P><HI>Steenwijck</HI> &s;eems to be an old City, though &s;mall. The Soyl a|bout it is rich in corn, and affords in &s;ome places &s;tore of Turf, whereby the City hath a rea&s;onable Trade. It u&s;ed formerly to be a weak City: but &s;ince the Wars with <HI>Spain,</HI> it is grown very &s;trong. It hath formerly had a Ca&s;tle, but de&s;troy'd in the year 1523.</P>
<P><HI>Ha&s;&s;elt</HI> is a good, rea&s;onable rich, and &s;trong City.</P>
<P>The old Village <HI>Ootmar&s;en</HI> was, as <HI>Trithemius</HI> writes, founded by <HI>Odemar</HI> King of <HI>France,</HI> from whom it hath its name: He built it upon the Grave of his &s;pecial Friend <HI>Vechtan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Olde&s;eel</HI> is held to take its name from the People of old called <HI>Salii:</HI> it is a &s;mall Village; and is the onely Village of <HI>Overy&s;&s;el</HI> that is under the command of the Arch-Duke, who ordinarily keeps a Garri&s;on here.</P>

<P>It hath many flowing and &s;tanding Waters, led to it by many great Rivers, part made by Nature, and part by mens hands. It is a large, fair, Populous and &s;trong City, full of brave and Lordlike Hou&s;es. Its chief Church is a very &s;tately building, and dedicated to the honour of St. <HI>Martin,</HI> and was formerly under the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> in <HI>We&s;tphalia,</HI> but was, by King <HI>Philip</HI> the &s;econd, it &s;elf ad|vanced to the Honour of a Bi&s;hops See.

<P>In the year 1614, the States General erected an Univer&s;ity in this City, and have &s;pared no co&s;t to furni&s;h it with Learned men from all parts.</P>
<P>The Authority of this City is very great, and extends it &s;elf very far: For fir&s;t, it hath Ea&s;twards and We&s;twards under its juri&s;diction a very large Country, and many Villges in it; Northwards it hath acknowledgment from all the Country that lies between its Walls and the Sea; which is a very fat &s;oil, and e&s;pecially good for the feeding of Cattle. This Country, as was &s;aid, is called the <HI>Ommelanden.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Groeningen</HI> the People live very hand&s;omly, like Citizens, as in a free Re|publique: for the City hath great Priviledges and Franchi&s;es from their Princes, Judging all Cau&s;es both Civil and Criminal according to their own Laws; the Princes keeping there only a Stadt-holder, as the States General do in Civil Cau&s;es; but in Criminal they act according to their own plea&s;ure, &s;hewing Mercy or Ju&s;tice to whom they plea&s;e, even as ab&s;olute and Sovereign Lords do.
