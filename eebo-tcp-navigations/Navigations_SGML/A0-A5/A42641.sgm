<HEAD>To Judicious Courteous READERS.</HEAD>
<P>THough a Dedicatory Epistle appropriates a Treaty to a prime Reader; yet it being past the Presse, it cannot escape di|verse who according to Old custome, look for some addresse to them to be called Judicious, and Courteous, when it happens with Books as with Buildings, scarce seen by any man but dislikt in one thing or other, for that all mens fancies differ, and therefore it was no wonder a very Judicious Noble Person of this Na|tion
<PB REF="5">
said, <HI>he would not for five Hundred pound hove put forth a Book, for that, some are consi|dered but for their outside, and only the Title lookt on, or some two or three leaves turned, and if but one word therein not suta|ble to their fancy; it is thrown in a corner, and the Author laught at and censured;</HI> but since I let this <HI>Vade Mecum</HI> go, and Dedicatory Epistles are required, I thought fit to tell you, that my scope is not to say <HI>peradventure</HI> what might stop some Lazy bones at their Fathers Chimney corner; as those who would not trouble themselves to see things so they had but the list, and then
<PB REF="5">
pretend as a fond Mother at <HI>Delfe</HI> in <HI>Holland,</HI> that her Son could speak <HI>Italian,</HI> because he was once minded to go for <HI>Venice.</HI> And how many great Orators in their Books presume to speak a high Lan|guage to <HI>Caesars,</HI> and even to <HI>A|lexanders,</HI> when as admitted to their Presence; either remain Mute or Stutter.</P>
<P>In a word, the scope of this <HI>Va|de Mecum</HI> in the few particulars held forth, is the Travelers interest; That he may set forth with such an Opinion of those Nations, which he shall do well to visit, and such parts which he may see, as may give him the more desire to enquire in person
<PB REF="6">
after all those things, for the which Travell is to serve better then Rea|ding, since Objects seen, and mat|ters experimented, are seldome blotted out of remembrance.</P>
<P>This <HI>Vade Mecum</HI> therefore leaves to those that will not or can|not Travell, the reading of such co|pious, compleat and excellent de|scriptions as are extant in their mo|ther tongue; and especially penned by men, who did not care to carp as severall men make their profession, both at Religion and State Maxims; or particular passions and inclinati|ons.</P>
<P>Farthermore, the Traveller will find good and bad as well in his own
<PB REF="6">
native Country, as in Forraigne parts, wheresoever he steers, that <HI>Sola ratio Hominem &agrave; Brutis animalibus saeparat.</HI> That with|out the putting knowledge in pra|ctise, it will be with him both at home and abroad, according unto the saying <HI>Theoria absque praxi, I|dem est quod pharmacopaeis herbarum scientia absque appli|cationis cognitione servit;</HI> He will find in what condition Time, Malice, or Fate may reduce him, that <HI>Scientia est Summum bo|num, quod nec Naufragiis, nec Latronum spoliis subjectum est.</HI> And that there is nothing more cer|tain then the saying, <HI>Scientia ad|haeret</HI>
<PB REF="7">
<HI>in extremo vitae suspirio,</HI> that <HI>Eruditio, &amp; arma, sunt ve rae Nobilitatis gradus,</HI> and <HI>Ju|stitia &amp; Pietas, sunt Illustrissi|ma heroicorum Imperatorum specula;</HI> Finally, that <HI>sola vir|tus dulcissimum Animae sola|men est,</HI> may all Travellers and those that stay at home find it to be so.</P>

<P><HI>_PApirus,</HI> a General of the <HI>Romanes,</HI> having resolved to Fight their Enemies, Engaged on apparent hope of a notorious ad|vantagious Victory, yet had omitted the consult|ing of the Oracle, then being certain Hens, to whom the Hen-Priests were to cast meat, whereupon they kept a great pudder, because the Hens (to whom the meat was

cast) would not take it, which moved <HI>Papirus</HI> to say, <HI>That if they would not eat, they might be thrown into the Sea to drink:</HI> whereupon <HI>Papirus</HI> his best Friends (in the Senat) sent him word, <HI>That though a Vi|ctorious General was commonly honoured with a Triumphant Reception, all they could pro|cure in his Favour (for his Victory) was to keep his Head where it stood;</HI> so great the crime of neglecting the Religion (in esteem with the people) was held, though never so absurd in it self, as that was to consult Hens.</P>
<P><HI>Antiochus,</HI> King of <HI>Syria,</HI> a barbarian, who had besieged <HI>Gier<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">solima,</HI> being sought by the Inhabitants for a Truce of seven dayes, to celebrate the Feast of the <HI>Taber|nacles,</HI> did not only grant this Request, but sent them a fat Bull with gilded Horns, and sundry golden Vessels full of Incense.</P>
<P><HI>Camilus</HI> having taken the City <HI>Veienti,</HI> and made a vow to offer the tenth part of the spoyls to the Temple of <HI>Apollo,</HI> seeing that the People and the Nobles were at such a variance, as if <HI>Rome</HI> were to be turn|ed up-side down; said, <HI>That he did not wonder at it, since vowes to God</HI> Apollo <HI>had not been performed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="13">
<HI>Marcellus</HI> being desirons (after the taking of <HI>Syracusa,</HI> to offer to two Gods, to wit, <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Vertue;</HI> it was opposed by the general voice, That <HI>there ought more respect to be born to the Gods, than to sacrifice to two of them at once, and in one place.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Concerning reverence due to the Christian Profession, and to Priests.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Constantine</HI> the Emperour had the Priests in so great esteem, that being in the Coun|cil of <HI>Calcedonie</HI> presented with a bundle of complaints against Church-men, he put them in his bosom, and being with drawn threw them into the fire.</P>
<P><HI>Alban Armer,</HI> being in the year 1499 taken by the <HI>Turks,</HI> suffered himself to be sawn through, rather than forsake the Chri|stian Profession.</P>
<P><HI>Marin</HI> (who by the Emperour <HI>Valeria</HI> was honoured by a Military Command) being discovered to be a Christian, and put to the choice of life or Death, having but three hours given him to recant, a naked Sword and a Bible laid before him, he choose the Sword, to stick to the Bible.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="14">
<HI>Hormisda</HI> and <HI>Suenes</HI> (noble persons in the Court of <HI>Ildegerdes</HI> a <HI>Persian</HI> King) made good their constancy to the Christian Profession, notwithstanding the first (though of the Royal blood) was degraded, stript naked, and sent to attend the Mules in the <HI>Persian</HI> Camp: <HI>Suenes</HI> was not only de|prived of all his Means, they were not only given to his Servant (who had betrayed him) but <HI>Suenes</HI> his Wife was given to that Servant, and <HI>Suenes</HI> a slave to them both.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Concerning Humility.</HEAD>
<P>When the People of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> offered to Crown <HI>Godsery de Boullon,</HI> he refused both the Title of King and the Crown of Gold, as being unfit a sinner should bear that Name and a Crown of Gold, the King of Kings having had one of Thorns.</P>
<P><HI>Tiberius</HI> (a Roman Emperour) would never suffer the Attendance of Senators a|bout his Litter, and being once a foot, met by a Citizen of <HI>Rome,</HI> who profered to cast himself at his feet, retired himself in such haste, as he fell on the ground.</P>
<P><HI>Frederick</HI> (Count of <HI>Urbin)</HI> was so
<PB N="5" REF="14">
humble of Heart, and so free to his Sub|jects, that going by the streets he would ask, to all those of his Acquaintance (and Vassals who he met) <HI>How they did? How their Father and Friends did? Whether they did prosper in their Vocation?</HI> And to the Young-men, Maidens, and Widows, <HI>When they would Marry?</HI> And speaking to every man with his Hat in his hand.</P>
<P>Those of <HI>Nova Hispania</HI> affect so much Humility, that whensoever they are to Crown their King, they put two Mantles on his shoulders, the one blew, the other black, this covered with dead bones, to put to his remembrance by the blew the Hea|vens to be above him; by the black, Mor|tallity.</P>
<P>So likewise when the great <HI>Cam</HI> of <HI>Cattay</HI> succeeded to the Empire, his Counsellors put him (with his Chair) on a black Felt, telling him, <HI>That he must look on the glorious light of the Sun, and on the obscurity of his Seat, that God is above the Sun, without whose mercy he cannot promise to himself the possessing in this world the worth of that black Felt whereon they have put him.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<PB N="6" REF="15">
<HEAD>Of Charity.</HEAD>
<P>King <HI>Amade</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> being sought by certain Embassadors (who did take great delight in Hunting and Hawking, to see his Kennel of Hounds) conveyed the Embas|sadors into a Gallery, wherein he shewed them a great number of poor People whom he did daily feed; and told the Em|bassadors, <HI>That he had no other Kennel, but did hope by them to purchase perpetual joyes.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sophia</HI> (Wife to the Emperour <HI>Justini|an)</HI> caused diligent enquiries to be made after the particular places where the poor people did pawn their Clothes, which she then redeemed, and sent them back to the Proprietors to make use of them.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Of Meekness, Benignity, and Clemency.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Eustorgus Salmin</HI> (King of <HI>Cyprus)</HI> was of such a meek Disposition, and so good, that Histories mention, he never gave any just cause of offence.</P>
<P>The Emperour <HI>Charles the Fift,</HI> having been advertised, That a desperate man had
<PB N="7" REF="15">
resolved an attempt on his person; called the man to him, and without making any shew of being advertised, or telling him any thing, gave him five thousand Ducats for a portion to his Daughter.</P>
<P><HI>Quintus Fabricius Maximus,</HI> being ad|vertised that <HI>Marso</HI> (a man valiant at arms) would betray him; caused him also to be called, and did ask him, <HI>How long he would suffer him to be his Debtor?</HI> gave him Horses, Arms, and Money.</P>
<P><HI>Caius Claudius Caligula</HI> (Emperour of <HI>Rome)</HI> caused all the Accusations made during the Raign of <HI>Tiberius</HI> to be burnt on the publick Market-place, nor could any man perswade him to take any particular notice of the Contents of them, nor to know any of the Names of the Conjura|tors.</P>
<P><HI>Lewis</HI> Duke of <HI>Orleance</HI> (who succeed|ed <HI>Charles the Eight,</HI> and was then called <HI>Lewis the Twelfth)</HI> being put in remem|brance of the Injuries Recorded during the time of his being Duke of <HI>Orleance,</HI> answered, <HI>That it would not become a French King to resent them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Henry of Bourbon</HI> (a <HI>French</HI> King) was
<PB N="8" REF="16">
so full of Clemency, as among thousands of testimonies which he gave of it, would have saved the Duke <HI>de Biron,</HI> who had conspired against his Royal person, if <HI>Biron</HI> would have relyed on his mercy.</P>
<P>As for daily marks of his matchless Cle|mency to wave all Resents against all ill|disposed persons; he made no other reply to a Libel which had been thrown on his way coming from <HI>Amiens</HI> to <HI>Paris,</HI> save <HI>The man hath said all, and hath forgotten nothing save his Name.</HI></P>
<P>Queen <HI>Catharine de Medicis</HI> (Mother to <HI>Charles the Ninth,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> King) being advertised that a great Libellist was penning a Book against her; sent for him, present|ed him with a Bag, with one thousand Pi|stols, and took no notice of the man's ma|lice against her.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="subsection">
<HEAD>Of Justice.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Artaserste</HI> being by his High Chancellor ingaged in a Promise, but finding the Boon could not be in Justice, he made in lieu of it a Present, to the value of the granted Boon; saying, <HI>The Gift could not make him poor, but the Boon would have made him unjust.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ribera</HI> (Vice-roy of <HI>Naples)</HI> having
<PB N="9" REF="16">
pardoned a Crime worthy of death, and being petitioned in behalf of the party for another heinous offence, said, <HI>the first was the offendors, the second would be his if Justice had not its course.</HI></P>

<P><HI>OCtavian Augustus,</HI> notwithstanding his warlike proceedings, let not one day pass without reading and making a speech.</P>
<P>The Emperour, <HI>Charles</HI> the <HI>Fourth,</HI> did take so great delight in Learning, as being at <HI>Prague,</HI> invited to hear an Orator, and having been four hours time entertained by the Orator, when his Lords did be|seech him to think on his dinner, the time being past an hour, he bid them go to their dinner; saying, <HI>He had fed himself with Learning.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Julius</HI> the Second was wont to say, <HI>Learning with the common People to be as Silver, Gold with the Nobles, Jewels with Soveraigns.</HI></P>
<P>Those Princes who have rendered them|selves famous for their great Knowledge, were carefully provided with choice of Teachers, <HI>Darius</HI> had <HI>Lucan; Alexander</HI> the Great <HI>Aristocles; Artaxerces Mindare; Palemon</HI> (Captain of the <HI>Athenians) Xeno|crate;</HI>

<P>So there came more Travellers to <HI>Rome</HI> to see <HI>Titus Livius,</HI> and to speak to him, than to see the Magnificency of that Epi|tome of the World.

<P>The List of all these abominations may justly move all Travellers to thank God, that there is at present no danger to be en|slaved in the damnable Observation of them, but also to implore of the Almighty, that they may not meet in their travel with such as <HI>Bordelots,</HI> whose wilfulness moves them to perswade others to entertain no belief at all; such as <HI>Bordelot</HI> taught (du|ring his being among the <HI>Goths)</HI> to utter in publick, <HI>That King</HI> Charles <HI>of blessed me|mory did deserve to lose his head, because his hand wrote so much of God:</HI> whose blessed memory justly moves and obligeth me to mention this, for having been an ear wit|ness of that most diabolical utterance.</P>

<P>ANd in the first place, to manifest that my Princely Traveller is of the old <HI>Count</HI> of <HI>Egmonds</HI> opinion, That there are no Arms more gaudy and inpertinent than those which many ignoble fantastick Me|chanicks do hold forth.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the true original of Arms was the Heroick Acts of a Nation, and Vi|ctory fought by them; when (to perpe|tuate the memory thereof) Trophes and Coats were made, representing the van|quish'd
<PB N="22" REF="23">
party; for if they (in the day of Battel) had covered their Heads with Lyons, Leopards, or Tygers skins, the Conqueror would Coat them as the most notorious marks to have vanquisht that party: What Coat of Arms <HI>Antraphel</HI> the first King (and <HI>Moses</HI> the first Duke) had, is not ascertained; some Heralds give to <HI>Joshua</HI> a Thunder-bolt, Gule; with wings Azur; and for Crest a Dragon Azur; to King <HI>David</HI> a Sling Azur, Field Argent, for Crest a Lions head, signifying his Vi|ctory on the <HI>Philistins</HI> by the Sling; and that against a Lion by the Crest.</P>
<P><HI>Joseph's</HI> Brothers had no honorable nor civil cause to coat a bloody sprinckled Coat, which they shewed to their good old Father <HI>Jacob: Cain</HI> had less just honour|able cause than they to coat <HI>Abel's</HI> Altar, and pleasing Sacrifice to God.</P>
<P>The World, before its eighteen hundred years of age, knew of no pitch'd Battel fought.</P>
<P>The <HI>Romans</HI> (before <HI>Marius)</HI> did only pitch a bundle of Hay on the top of a Lance, to signifie thereby their Husband-like profession; they put likewise a bundle
<PB N="23" REF="23">
of green Leaves (as of a bunch of Turnips) on a like Standard; whereupon they fixt a Banner with the Letters, S. P. E. R. but they soon changed those homely signs into a commanding Hand; then to a <HI>Dragon,</HI> as a thing that could bite, and called the Standard-bearer <HI>Draconarius,</HI> which they seconded with inflamed Altars, and then with an Eagle, whereon <HI>Marius</HI> put a Crown; and doubtless their Rams heads in their Trophes (if they as <HI>Cromwel</HI> could have spoke) would have askt, and <HI>will you not Crown us also?</HI> since Leopards as well as Eagles have had that honour.</P>
<P>In the Arms of <HI>Merove</HI> (the first of the three sources of the <HI>French</HI> Kings) was put a Lion Gule, holding in his paw an Impe|rial Eagle, signifying that he had ceised on part of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; he Raigned ten years in <HI>Germany,</HI> and in <HI>Gaule,</HI> from whence the <HI>Romans</HI> could not force his re|treat.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fluer de Lis</HI> in the <HI>French</HI> King's Arms since <HI>Clovis</HI> and the <HI>Thoads,</HI> since <HI>Pharamond</HI> his predecessor (the first Chri|stian <HI>French</HI> King) had their original not from Fabels, who supposed the <HI>Fluer de Lis</HI>

<HEAD>Sect. 4.</HEAD>
<P><HI>MArolois, Fritach, Errard,</HI> and <HI>de Ville,</HI> are four Authors, who have treated very pertinently (and Methodical|ly) on the Military Art, and maintained how Military-men are to be Armed, what
<PB N="25" REF="24">
spare Arms are requisite, what Ammuniti|ons of War, what provisions of Victuals; what care a Governor ought to have, both in regular and irregular places, how faults are to be mended, how to judge, wherein the perfection and imperfection of all For|tifications consists, to wit, <HI>That all the parts of a Forteress must be flanked:</HI> that is to say, seen side-wayes, which is mutually to be defended; and that defence is to be made by all such aims as may contribute to a de|fence at a distance, as by Canon or Musket; whence ariseth the question, <HI>Whether that part which is to be defended, ought to be either within Canon or Musket shot of that part which defends it?</HI> The most common (and best opinions) are, That it ought to be within Musket reach; which argueth, that all Fortresses must be so constructed, as that all their parts must be defended by or|dinary Muskets, which do carry one hun|dred and twenty paces, which is of the meaner sort.</P>
<P>Now as the said Defences may be form|ed several wayes (as by half Bastions and the like) the question may be, <HI>Which of all them is the best way of Fortification?</HI> which
<PB N="26" REF="25">
hath been generally resolved on as follow|eth, <HI>That such Bastions as are composed of Flanks, Gorges, Faces, and Angles, have pro|ved the best Fortresses, especially such as had a competent space left betwixt each Bastions,</HI> termed a Curtin, which is the determina|tion of all true <HI>Mathematicians</HI> in their constructions; but they never (as yet) a|greed how the quantities of the several parts were to be proportioned; and hence the several and various constructions of Fortresses do arise, and are become subject to the humours and conceits of the Artists, who (according to their several sancies) do augment or diminish the several proporti|ons.</P>
<P>But the indisputable perfection of Forti|sication consists in this, viz. <HI>That the place be well flanked by such bodies as are separated from each other, only at a certain distance, so as the remotest part (which is to be desended) be no farther distant from that which is to de|send it, than one hundred and fourscore paces; and the which must be divided into Courtines, Gorges, Flanks, and Faces, as above said.</HI></P>
<P>To hit (as to say) the Bird in the eye, to wit, the attaining to this perfection, the
<PB N="27" REF="25">
Artist must make a diligent tryal of the di|visions which may best answer his purpose; not departing from the unmoveable ground work, <HI>That such places are most de|sencible as are best flanked, and to be flanked;</HI> which is the main scope in Fortifying, to wit, to <HI>flank and to be flanked.</HI> But as those things which have no settled determinati|on (and on which discourses may be grounded) are very hard to be resolved; suppose therefore what extent you will, ei|ther a great or a less may be said as good as the other; but a mean extent betwixt both, may prove the best, since a mean ex|tent squares best with all the parts of a For|tress, since when one intends to Fortifie the side of the Figure must be taken, for it can|not be otherwise, that when one is to for|tifie, he supposeth a subject to be fortified, and that to be a place, which must be sup|posed, and that place to have some figure, which figure is the thing to be fortified.</P>
<P>Now the method which some observe in Fortifying, by taking the distance from one point of the Bastion to the other, is ve|ry absurd, since thereby the Artist seems to suppose what should have been sought for,
<PB N="28" REF="26">
and seeketh what should have been sup|posed; which contradicts reason it self.</P>
<P>As for Example, One desires to fortifie an <HI>Exagone;</HI> and supposeth a line which is to be the distance from one point of a Bastion to the other; and that one may trace this line of a just and exact length, one must return backwards and have found out the line of defence, or the sides of the figure, which are the only measures requi|site, and by the which all the others must be traced, so that one must either have shortned or enlarged the said line, being the distance of the Bastions points, until such time as one hath found the line of defence, or the side of the figure, without having all that time had any regard unto the di|stance of the Musket shot.</P>
<P>Or otherwise, One must first have traced either the sides of the figure, or the line of defence, and so from thence have inferred the distance from one Bastion to another, and by this (as is most certain) the con|struction will be contrary to reason; for that one supposeth that which is sought for, and seeks that which is supposed; which is against all order and reason, serving only
<PB N="29" REF="26">
to confound a man's intellect, and to make Idiots the more admire this Science, by gi|ving credit to these seeming high imagina|tions, because they understand them not, nor will they take the pains to dive into the Mistery, and search whether the diffi|culties they meet with, proceed from the obscure Rules by some men set down, or from the thing it self; therefore it may be judiciously said, That all such Constructi|ons are naught, and like unto so many by|wayes, leading a man about, when at the very instant he may pitch on the thing it self, <HI>Which is to make a place that may be well flanked from all sides, and within Mus|ket shot,</HI> it being the main thing in all For|tresses.</P>
<P>There is likewise another troublesome Construction depending on the Diametor of the Figure, whereon some Artists will give no other reason than that there must be a Line of Defence; <HI>Ergo,</HI> a Line of De|fence ought first to have been traced, since all depends of it. Others suppose that the first to be begun is the faces of their Basti|ons, and to compute the proportions there|of with the remainder of the Line of De|fence,
<PB N="30" REF="27">
when as this would prove the worst of all, since it would follow that all the rest of the measures in the Fortress must be conformable to the faces of the Bastions, when as the line is the least considerable, and the last in all order of constructions, as being the weakest part, for that it al|wayes suffers, because its continually flank|ed, and the face of a Bastion is that which is alwayes attach'd.</P>
<P>Thus much I thought fit to note on For|tisication, as being one of the prime Sub|jects whereon a <HI>Germane Cavallier</HI> will discourse: I have not over-pestered the same with its common rudiments, which properly do belong to a large Treaty.</P>
<P>I shall only note, That the strongest and most seeming impregnable Fortification cannot resist want of Victuals, or any other thing (as the <HI>French</HI> say) <HI>Qui auroit pence &agrave; cela:</HI> an Ass loaden with Gold will enter any Fortress; as the Poets fain their <HI>Jupiter</HI> to have made his way to the strait|est passage <HI>Danae</HI> had by a golden shoar; against which, the <HI>Dodecagone</HI> (with twelve Bastions with <HI>Cavalliers</HI> (were they as high as the <HI>Puenean Hills)</HI> must yield,
<PB N="31" REF="27">
as the <HI>Endecagone</HI> with Horn-works, the <HI>Decagone, Enneagone, Octogone, Eptagone, Exagone, Pentagone,</HI> as the <HI>Tetragone:</HI> For as <HI>Henry</HI> the Fourth of <HI>France</HI> said, <HI>C'est le dernier Escu qui gaine la bataille;</HI> So <HI>Maurice,</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> was used to say, <HI>C'est le dernier pani qui gaigne la place.</HI></P>
<P>The first in English, <HI>Its the last Crown that gets the battel:</HI> The second, <HI>Its the last Bread which gets the place.</HI></P>
<P>As for point of Honour, it can be maintained that there is no employment in the Warlike profession, wherein more cre|dit can be had, than in a besieged place; since in Combats Fortune hath the greatest share; Parties are oft equal; the courses are not regular; as likewise the besieger hath a devided Command; divers on-sets are made by sundry Commanders; as it is presupposed that the besieger comes with Forces sufficient to take the place; and finaly, that all besieged places must be taken; and that he who takes it not, must suffer in his credit; that the one is directly contra|ry to what was expected, and supposed to be a default.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="28">
The other is as a thing which was cer|tain to be.</P>
<P>But he who defends a place, is alone, and all what he doth is attributed directly unto him, be it well or ill done; the de|fence depends of him and his carriage, and very little of Fortune.</P>
<P>If he defends himself so well, as that he constrains an enemy to raise the Siege, is it not a wonder, and against the opinion of all men, even to hold out longer than was imagined he could do?</P>
<P>And all this is attributed to the Person that Commanded in the place: Finally, it may wel be thought, that he who causeth a Siege to be raised, gets more honour than he who gains a Battel; for that by his long holding out, he destroyes an Army, saves his Men, the Place, and State.</P>
<P>The Marshal <HI>Turenne</HI> said of the Prince <HI>de Conde,</HI> to have found him in all the parts of the Army; so may it be said of a place well defended, <HI>That the Governour must be met in all nooks, corners, and flanks there|of.</HI></P>

my Travels, and the Christian profession more particularly requires: That if the defence of a place needs such great cares, those who may resolve to expose their per|sons to the wild world, what care will there not be requisite for the defence of that which will as long as it is the commander of a dungeon (or <HI>fortin,</HI> called the <HI>body of man)</HI> be assaulted by legions who are never tired, who needs not to borrow nor buy Victuals, nor Ammunltions, who have millions of Petards which they can fix to the Gates of such a Fort, without running any hazard of Mines, nor Casa-mats, but who can also deceive the Sentinels eyes with illusions, who can steer their darts point-blank to the eyes, or the heart of a man?</P>
<P>What honour will it not be to a Travel|ler, to cause such Enemies to raise the siege and to retire, as it was the Prayer of King <HI>David,</HI> the man according unto the heart of the Lord of Hosts?</P>

in the yeare 426, which was 350 years before the time that the French did find themselves in possession on the other side of the River <HI>Sala,</HI> which was in <HI>Anno</HI> 805; but as there are no proofs against the opinion concerning the names of the Kings since the time of <HI>Francion</HI> (second Son to <HI>Hector)</HI> untill <HI>Pharamond,</HI> it may not be thought unfit to be of the Opinion of the most curious observators of the Royall de|scents of the <HI>French,</HI> that since the establish|ment of that Empire, it hath been in those three Lines as aforesaid; so the Line of <HI>Hugh Capet,</HI> hath Reigned above six hun|dred and 20 years. The well affected to the Illustrious descent of the French say, that the <HI>Francks</HI> having conquered the <HI>Gaules,</HI> called the Country <HI>France,</HI> and made a Monarchie of it, though it was sometimes divided among Sons of Kings, the Eldest whereof, was as the Master and Soveraigne to the others: their Armes have been so different as that untill they were quartered with <HI>Fleur de Lis,</HI> they have been very uncertain.</P>

Kings untill this present time in the Line of <HI>Boucley.</HI> The Kingdome of France, (as the <HI>French</HI> will have it) falls not to the distaf <HI>[Lilia non nent]</HI> though <HI>Julius Caesar</HI> said of them, that though in their first heat, they seem to be more then Men, but afterwards to be lesse then woman.

<P>The <HI>French</HI> do generally love their King: they are accustomed to a liberty, which takes not with all Nations, they are much addicted to change, which seems to be their life and element: but as they are prompt to commit faults, they are as quick to repaire them: they love and esteem strangers, hear their profers with attention; they are libe|rall in bestowing great charges of trust on them, though different of Religion, for example, the Duke <HI>de la Force, Marshall de Chastillon, Torras, Turien, Gassion, Ransoro, Balthazar,</HI> and many others I shall not

overburden this with the list of the great and mighty Cities, whereof there are 53 as Metropolitans; their nine Parliament Citties in respective shires; where they are Courts of Justice. Neither shall I spend time with such minutes, as mentioned in o|ther copious recitalls, to wit, the difference between the proceeding of Spanish and French in their dressing of themselves, which signify nothing to a Traveller, though I shall note for the observation of all Travellers, certain precise Civilities which the well bred French will observe, and doe look for from all Travellers.</P>
<P>First they confine salutations to Ladies within the bounds of arrivall and depar|ture, the Familiarity of Kisses being thought an uncivill boldnesse at any other time, and were become troublesome, especially from snottinose, young striplings who had lear|ned no other quality. It is not permitted to any Gentleman who visits a Lady, to lay downe Cloake or Hat, except in such pla|ces that can endure Doublet and Breeches to keep the Cloake and Hat company. A Gentleman who hath the honour to Usher a Princesse, must not yeeld her hand to a|ny
<PB N="85" REF="54">
man, except to a Prince, or a Marshall of France.</P>
<P>Never refuse but take as a particular Ho|nour, the accepting to present to a Prince or Princesse the cup or glasse, which by that Prince or Princesse domestick servant may be brought.</P>
<P>Its not the custome when a Prince doth Sneese, to say as to other persons (and the old civility was) <HI>Dieu vous ayde,</HI> God help you, but only to make a Low reverence.</P>
<P>Though a French Prince should to a stander by at his Table, present something which may be eaten, yet must he not tast thereof, except the Prince commands it, and it is the like with any Fruit presented between Meales.</P>
<P>If a Gentleman be admitted to a Prince his Table, he is not to drinke before the Prince had his Glasse. No Broth is to be taken out of a Dish, but first laid on the trencher.</P>
<P>No yolk of Eggs sipped out of the shell, but taken out with a spoone. Nor any blowing of hot Broth in a spoon, which little nicities, must be observed by any man
<PB N="86" REF="55">
that will passe for a Gentleman among the Nobility of France: and are here recited only in reference, and for the observation of those who have the honour to accom|pany a Prince in his Travell. A <HI>Princely Traveller</HI> curious to know all the ancient and Moderne affairs of France, will do well to visit the Library of <HI>Mons du Puy,</HI> who hath a collection of above a hundred Vo|lumes of Manuscripts; as also visit the Li|brary of the Count <HI>de Brienne,</HI> for he hath 120 Volumes of Manuscripts, containing the Treaties and Alliances made with For|raigne Princes, and all the rare pieces of State since <HI>Lewis</HI> the <HI>XI.</HI> and among them to take particular notice of the Memorialls of Mr <HI>de Villeroy</HI> and President <HI>Genin,</HI> who were Great men in King <HI>Henry</HI> the 4th his time. As for publick visits, a Princely Tra|veller (who knoweth what the publick Ac|cademies for exercises, and for the know|ledge of the Mathematicks are) shall not need to spend time with Academies, but call upon Masters of <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> to accom|pany him for the first time, and afterwards (untill departure) use the liberty of France in visits, not in Italy, nor Spaine, where the
<PB N="87" REF="55">
day and hower for visits must be deman|ded.</P>
<P>Hee shall not use any complement in the retreat from a conversation, for it is the manner to depart without any ceremony; except the company be all gone.</P>
<P>As for the visiting of Embassadors, it is most fit to consult their leasure, as well in France as in other parts, for it is with them as it was with him who had written on his dore, <HI>Whosoever hath knockt twice and is not opened may be gone, for I am not, cannot, or will not be at home.</HI></P>
<P>Embassadors are as publick Sentinells, they have their set time of guard, and no conversation then to be had with them.</P>
<P>It is fit for a Princely Traveller to visit them, to entertaine amity with those Sove|raignes, whom they represent, and to know the continuall case of their affaires and in|triques: and to that purpose, to visit al|so those Ladies where the publick Ministers do frequent, where a Traveller will heare (as from Parrets when their cage is in the Sun) all what occurres.</P>

<P>And as for the Prime of men, let them take notice on the successors of the great <HI>Emanuel</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> and never be wrought upon, by what the Cardinall <HI>d'Ossat</HI> in his passion wrote against that Great Duke of <HI>Savoy,</HI> by Birth King of <HI>Cypres,</HI> of the old <HI>Saxon, Imperiall, Spanish</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Roy|all blood; most magnanimous in all his proceedings; more rich in Jewells then any other Prince in Europe; attended by a great number of Nobles, and in as much Pompe as any Christian Soveraigne Prince can be, a Nobility extreme Generous and Gentile, the Ladies so Beautifull, as that they are called (all <HI>Italy</HI> over) the Faire <HI>Piedmontese.</HI></P>

The liberty of the Court of <HI>Savoy</HI> is mo|derated between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>The first considerable object a Traveller shall meet with in <HI>Savoy,</HI> is the fortresse of <HI>Mount-Milan,</HI> which withstood a yeare and above, all the French Kings Army, when King <HI>Lewis</HI> the 15th had set upon it all the courage of the Nation, and all what could be attempted by <HI>Jupiter-like</HI> flames, and <HI>Vulcan</HI> like forgery, to blow up the For|tresse, to which, the French King had invi|ted all the adjacent Nobility to be specta|tors, but the successe proved a forced re|treat of the French Army.</P>
<P><HI>Chambray</HI> (the first Metropolitan of <HI>Sa|voy,</HI> seated as a center to the Hills, as if those whereon the Tempter set the King of Kings) may be the first nights lodging to a Traveller, who will see there that most magnificent Stable, built by the late Prince <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Savoy;</HI> all of white Marble with|in; the Post, the Manger, and the Racks of massy Copper, to entertaine one hundred great saddle Horses.</P>
<P><HI>Susa</HI> is the next great Fortresse. The next place of note is <HI>Rivoly</HI> (14 <HI>Italian</HI> miles from <HI>Turin.) Rivoly</HI> is a place with
<PB N="90" REF="57">
variety of rich furniture, the gardins Eden like, as in that at <HI>Turin,</HI> 85 Brazen metall Vases, 8 foot high, all imbossed by the fa|mous <HI>John de Bologne,</HI> cast so as the like of them is not to be seen in Europe, except in a <HI>Dorade</HI> within the Kingdome of the A|merican <HI>Guiana,</HI> where such (and other or|naments) are of massie Gold.</P>
<P>The rare Palaces and Seats without <HI>Tu|rin,</HI> are first, that of the <HI>Capuchins</HI> built by the Duke, as the Rotonde at <HI>Rome,</HI> all of Marble, and to serve also in time of Warre for a Fortresse of defence.</P>
<P>The next is the Palace of the late Cardi|nall <HI>Maurice,</HI> Uncle to the present Duke of <HI>Savoy.</HI></P>
<P>That of <HI>Valentin</HI> neer the River <HI>Po,</HI> a mile from <HI>Turin,</HI> and is as Noble as any can be seen in all <HI>Italy.</HI> Three mile farther is that called <HI>Mile Fiori,</HI> (a thousand flow|ers) and may it raise the <HI>Savoyards</HI> and <HI>Pie|montesis</HI> thoughts to that Bower whereof the Imperialls, and the choice <HI>Anemones</HI> are Sunne, Moone, and Starres, whereon <HI>Con|stantine</HI> made his Victorious conclusion, as is seen neerer to the Equinoctiall then <HI>Eng|land</HI> is to the cape of good hope.

<P><HI>Padua</HI> may prove the first place which a Traveller will call upon in his repaire to <HI>Venice,</HI> where if among the disereet he be pleased to speake in sober termes of St <HI>An|thonio</HI> (as at <HI>Milan</HI> of St <HI>Carlo di Boromeo)</HI> he will never be dislikt of; for an <HI>Italian</HI> will converse with a discreet stranger with|out questioning his particular profession, it being granted among them, that all <HI>Tra|montany</HI> (all men beyond the Hills) may be Hereticks; yet giving no offence in their Churches (where no man is compelled to go) lesse to their beds, a man (never so much <HI>Tramontany)</HI> may live <HI>Methusalems</HI> days among them, without any troubles at all, except how to drink drunk, for its not in practise among them; revengefull they are against their own Countrymen: they hold it to be an honour, and an imitation of the Poets thundering <HI>Jupiter,</HI> who hath reserved the sweetest to himselfe, to wit, <HI>Vengeance.</HI> They make (as before said) a great distinction between Strangers and their Natives, who they would on all occa|sions, have to proceed as by Mathematick rules, and even on the least, as in going to a

<P>Their leisure must be consulted as if they were all Embassadors, or prime Ministers of state; few words must serve turne with them, and some discourses answered with a shrug or nodding of the head; Oathes mixt with other words are not credited, they affect few examples to support truth.</P>
<P>The next delightfull Progresse will be for <HI>Venice,</HI> that microcosme of all the Ci|ties which do represent the reliques of a de|loge, the River <HI>Brenta</HI> will appear as the best in Eden might have been, if the first Landlord had not been drove out of it, there being such ravishing Palaces, and Gar|dens planted on both sides: as for <HI>Venice</HI> it selfe, (that Metropolitan Ark made of stone) there is in it (as the <HI>Italian</HI> saith) <HI>molto bene &amp; molto male,</HI> a Prince may live therein, with a couple of Gundoliers, and a couple of Men, one for his Kitching, the other for his bedchamber, so he shun the Horentin horrid Vice, to save <HI>Pasquin</HI> the

<P>And if a man speaks but with civill re|spect of the Old Madona of <HI>Loretta,</HI> he needs not to trouble himselfe with his pro|fession of Faith, they are free Blades, who when King <HI>Francis</HI> the first of France had threatned Italy, and them in particular, were not affrighted nor moved from their <HI>Arsenao,</HI> nor <HI>Concilio di dieci,</HI> by <HI>Francis</HI> the first his merry reply to his Jester, who after he had askt of the French King, whe|ther the men of his Great Councell had thought on a way of retreat, as well as to enter the State of <HI>Venice,</HI> replyed, <HI>The Se|nate had wise heads, but he would put so ma|ny young French fools upon them, as might be able to disturbe their set day of Councell:</HI> But thousands of the young fools, their bones (as yet to be seen about <HI>Pavia)</HI> could not returne into France.</P>

<P>But with what spirit the Painters of our age, do represent at the belly of a Lyon Rampant (which as the Unicorne is one of the supporters of the Kings Armes) a red thing exposed to the full view of many Vir|gins, and chast mothers of Children, who cannot well behold such an aspect without a blush, I leave to loose Christians to ex|pound, I wish others would comma~nd (I mean the Church wardens) the painter to spare his red colour, and forbeare the fore|stalling that offensive needles distinction of male and female in such a place, wherein

<P>As for Cavalier-like Civilities, the Gal|lantry of the Napolitans, deserves the visit|ing them; as also the Antiquities of <HI>Puteoli,</HI> where the Apostle St <HI>Paul</HI> was, where the Inhabitants profer his Medall to Travellers.</P>
<P>There is to be observed in the first place, <HI>Mont Cenere,</HI> a Hill of Ashes, which did rise in the space of 48 howers: Secondly <HI>la Sol|fatera,</HI> (as the Cave out of which <HI>Mount Cenere</HI> did rise) whereof the perpetuall noyse (proceeding from the Sulphureous exhalations) is heard many miles from that place, as the discharge of Chambres on the Kings Coronation day, in that <HI>Solfatara</HI> a world of Sulphur is made.

<P>And being satisfied of those parts return|ing by <HI>Loretta,</HI> see a Chappell more consi|derable to the Romans, then the Stable wherein the Saviour of the World was Borne, since this was never said to have been built but by some Mason or Carpen|ter, that by the hands of Angels, who are said to have brought it where it stands, garnisht within, not with Hay and Cob|webbs (as many Stables in ordinary Innes are) but with unestimable treasures, <HI>Pas|quin</HI> excuseth this to <HI>Morphorius,</HI> that it is a custome for Women to part from their Children in a mock, but when they appear with the Baby (as in Holland in the prank|ing room) then all is glistering trickt up and fine.</P>

<P>By Visits made to them, it will be easy to come to the knowledge of all passages, for they keep certain enterlopers, who find out any thing, though but too much Im|portune, and Impertinent, in their questi|oning what the Councill of the King, and

The <HI>Polans</HI> were wont to keep off Embassadors, so many dayes, as might serve to discover (by the Master of the Ceremonies) the particular humour and drifts of the Embassador; as during the time of the King of Blessed me|mory, by the keeping of Sir <HI>Peter Rubens,</HI> and the <HI>Portugal</HI> Embassadors, there was gotten this advantage, that His Majesty was ascertained that the <HI>Infanta Isabella</HI> the <HI>Arch.

Soveraigne Princes are best served by such Embassadors that can (in case of ne|cessity) hit the mark; that do not on all oc|casions draw the string of their Bowe to the uttermost, and overdoe their part, as some overpassionate Actors on a stage when they represent a King, Princes (whose heart the Soveraigne of Heaven and Earth doth steere besides their Magnanimous inclinati|ons) take seldome things as the French say <HI>a la pointe de l'espe&eacute;,</HI> as some Embassadors on the score of their being a Royall Repre|sentative, which in a Comedy of <HI>Viriona|ries</HI> by the French is notably Acted, by one who perswades himselfe to be an <HI>Alexan|der.</HI> The example of the Marquis <HI>de Senne|terr,</HI> during his being Extraordinary Em|bassador to King <HI>Charles</HI> the First of Bles|sed memory, may serve to prove the perni|cious consequence of violent proceedings, for that it did cause a rupture between the two Crownes of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> the Embassador who was lodged in <HI>Durrham</HI> House, caused his <HI>Bravos</HI> to accompany the English Roman Catholicks (who had been at the Masse) with swords drawn from the House to the street, to expostula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e with the
