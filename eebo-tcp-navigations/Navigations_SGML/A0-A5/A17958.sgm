<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_WHen I first composed this Treatise, not minding that it should be published in Print, I caused one|ly certaine written copies to bee giuen to some of my friends, and put <HI>Prosopopeia</HI> into the bookes mouth. But since that time, master <HI>Camdens</HI> often mencioning this worke, and my friends perswasions, haue caused my de|termination to alter, &amp; to imbrace a pleasing hope, that chari|tie, &amp; good construction resteth now generally in all Readers. Albeit, I well know, how <HI>Opere in vario,</HI> no lesse then in <HI>longo, fas est obrepere somnum.</HI> And I acknowledge, this playing work to come so farre short, of satisfying, euen my selfe (though <HI>Suus cui&abque; placet partus)</HI> as I haue little reason, to expect the applause of any other.</P>
<P>Besides, the state of our Countrie hath vndergone so ma|nie alterations, since I first began these scriblings, that, in the reuiewing, I was driuen, either likewise to varie my report, or else to speake against my knowledge. And no maruaile, for each succeeding time, addeth, or reaueth, goods, &amp; euils, accor|ding to the occasions, which it selfe produceth: rather a won|der it were, that in the ceaselesse reuolution of the Vniuerse, any parcell should retaine a stedfast constitution. Reckon therefore (I pray you) that this treatise plotteth downe <HI>Corn|wall,</HI> as it now standeth, for the particulars, and will conti|nue, for the generall. Mine <HI>Eulogies</HI> proceede no lesse, from the sinceritie of a witnesse, then the affection of a friend: and therefore I hope, that where my tongue hath beene good, no mans eye will bee euill: and that each wel-minded Reader will wish a merrie passage, to this my rather fancie-sporting, then gaine-seeking voyage.</P>

<HEAD>THE SVRVEY OF CORNWALL.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The first Booke.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_COrnwall,</HI> the farthest Shire <NOTE PLACE="marg">The name.</NOTE> of England Westwards, hath her name by diuers Authors diuerfly deri|ued. Some (as our owne Chroniclers) draw it from <HI>Corineus,</HI> cousin to <HI>Brute,</HI> the first Conquerour of this Iland: who wrastling at <HI>Plymmouth</HI> (as they say) with a mightie Giant, called <HI>Gogmagog,</HI> threw him o|uer Cliffe, brake his necke, and receiued the gift of that Countrie, in reward for his prowesse: Some, as <HI>Cerealis,</HI> (no lesse mistaken perhaps in that, then in his measures) from <HI>Cornu Galliae,</HI> a horne or corner of <HI>Fraunce,</HI> whereagainst nature hath placed it: and some, from <HI>Cornu Walliae,</HI> which (in my coniecture) carrieth greatest likelyhood of truth.</P>
<P>For what time the <HI>Saxons,</HI> after many bloudie in|uasions <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 586.</NOTE> as Pirates, began at last to plant their dwellings,
<PB REF="6">
and take roote in this Iland, as Conquerors, the <HI>Britons,</HI> by them supplanted, were driuen to seeke their safe|gard in the waste Moores, craggie Mountaines, and wild Forrests of <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>Cornwall,</HI> where the Coun|tries barrennesse barred their pursuers from victuals, and the dangerousnesse of the passages laid them open to priuie inuasions. Such as had in this sort withdrawne themselues, the <HI>Saxons</HI> termed <HI>Welshmen,</HI> by interpre|tation strangers, for so they were to them, as they to the Countrie: and their place of abode they called <HI>Welsh|land,</HI> sithence turned to <HI>Wales,</HI> euen as by the same rea|son, they giue still the same name to <HI>Italy.</HI> Now, <HI>Corn|wall</HI> being cast out into the Sea, with the shape of a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Shape.</NOTE> horne, borrowed the one part of her name from her fashion, as <HI>Matthew</HI> of <HI>Westminster</HI> testifieth, &amp; the other <NOTE PLACE="marg">Flores Hist.</NOTE> from her Inhabitants: both which conioyned, make <HI>Cornuwalliae,</HI> and contriued, <HI>Cornwall:</HI> in which sence, the <HI>Cornish</HI> people call it <HI>Kernow,</HI> deriued likewise from <HI>Kerne</HI> a horne. Neither needeth this composition to be accompted any way vncouth, seeing the same is made familiar vnto vs by the like in other Countries, as of <HI>Herbipolis</HI> in <HI>Germanie, Lombardie</HI> in <HI>Italy, Paleocastrum</HI> in <HI>Crete,</HI> and <HI>Neoportus</HI> in <HI>Carniola:</HI> all which with many other, are likewise compacted of double languages.</P>
<P>This ill-halsening hornie name, hath (as <HI>Corneto</HI> in <HI>Italy)</HI> opened a gap to the scoffes of many, who not knowing their owne present condition, or at least their future destinie, can be co~tented to draw an odious mirth from a publike infamie. But seeing the wisest Enditer, hath directed the penne of his holiest writers to vse this terme, not only in a good meaning, but also in a signifi|cant sense, and to sanctifie the thing it selfe in sundrie
<PB N="2" REF="6">
parts of his seruice: such iesters dishonest indiscretion, is rather charitably to bee pittied, then their exception either angerly to be grieued at, or seriously to bee con|futed.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant, how sorely the whole storie of <HI>Brute,</HI> is shaken by some of our late writers, and how stiffely supported by other some: as also that this wrast|ling pull betweene <HI>Corineus</HI> and <HI>Gogmagog,</HI> is reported to haue befallen at <HI>Douer.</HI> For mine owne part, though I reuerence antiquitie, and reckon it a kind of wrong, to exact an ouer-strict reason for all that which vpon credite shee deliuereth: yet I rather incline to their side, who would warrant her authoritie by apparant veritie. Notwithstanding, in this question, I will not take on me the person of either Iudge, or flickler: and therefore if there be any so plunged in the common floud, as they will still gripe fast, what they haue once caught hold on, let them sport themselues with these coniectures, vpon which mine auerment in behalfe of <HI>Plymmouth</HI> is grounded. The place where <HI>Brute</HI> is said to haue first landed, was <HI>Totnes</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and therfore this wrast|ling likely to haue chaunced there, sooner then else|where. The Prouince bestowed on <HI>Corineus</HI> for this ex|ployt, was <HI>Cornwall.</HI> It may then be presumed, that he receiued in reward the place where hee made proofe of his worth, and whose Prince (for so with others I take <HI>Gogmagog</HI> to haue beene) hee had conquered, euen as <HI>Cyrus</HI> recompenced <HI>Zopirus</HI> with the Citie <HI>Babylon,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Herodo|tus.</NOTE> which his policie had recouered. Againe, the actiuitie of <HI>Deuon</HI> and <HI>Cornishmen,</HI> in this facultie of wrastling, beyond those of other Shires, dooth seeme to deriue them a speciall pedigree, from that graund wrastler
<PB REF="7">
<HI>Corineus.</HI> Moreouer, vpon the Hawe at <HI>Plymmouth,</HI> there is cut out in the ground, the pourtrayture of two men, the one bigger, the other lesser, with Clubbes in their hands, (whom they terme <HI>Gog-Magog)</HI> and (as I haue learned) it is renewed by order of the Townesmen, when cause requireth, which should inferre the same to bee a monument of some moment. And lastly the place, hauing a steepe cliffe adioyning, affordeth an o|portunitie to the fact. But of this too much.</P>
<P><HI>Cornwall</HI> is seated (as most men accompt) in the La|titude of fiftie degrees, and thirtie minutes: and in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Climate.</NOTE> Longitude of sixe.</P>
<P>The Shire extendeth in length to about seuentie <NOTE PLACE="marg">Length and breadth.</NOTE> miles: the breadth, as almost no where equall, so in the largest place, it passeth not thirtie, in the middle twen|tie, and in the narrowest of the West part, three. The whole compasse may hereby be coniectured.</P>
<P>It bordereth on the East with <HI>Deuon,</HI> diuided there|from, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Borders</NOTE> in most places, by the ryuer <HI>Tamer,</HI> which sprin|ging neere the North Sea, at <HI>Hartland</HI> in <HI>Deuon,</HI> run|neth thorow <HI>Plymmouth Hauen,</HI> into the South. For the rest, the maine Ocean sundreth the same, on the North from <HI>Ireland,</HI> on the West from the Ilands of <HI>Scilley,</HI> &amp; on the South from little <HI>Britaine.</HI> These borders now thus straightned, did once extend so wide, as that they enabled their inclosed territorie, with the title of a kingdome. <HI>Polidore Virgil</HI> allotteth it the fourth part of the whole Iland, and the ancient Chronicles report, that <HI>Brute</HI> landed at <HI>Totnes</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> a Towne now seated in the midst of <HI>Deuon.</HI> Moreouer, vntill <HI>Athel|stanes</HI> time, the <HI>Cornish-men</HI> bare equal sway in <HI>Excester</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 937.</NOTE> with the English: for hee it was who hemmed them
<PB N="3" REF="7">
within their present limits. Lastly, the encroaching Sea hath rauined from it, the whole Countrie of <HI>Lionnesse,</HI> together with diuers other parcels of no little circuite: and that such a <HI>Lionnesse</HI> there was, these proofes are yet remaining. The space betweene the lands end, and the Iles of <HI>Scilley,</HI> being about thirtie miles, to this day re|taineth that name, in Cornish <HI>Lethowsow,</HI> and carrieth continually an equall depth of fortie or sixtie fathom (a thing not vsuall in the Seas proper Dominion) saue that about the midway, there lieth a Rocke, which at low water discouereth his head. They terme it the Gulfe, suiting thereby the other name of <HI>Scilla.</HI> Fisher|men also casting their hookes thereabouts, haue drawn vp peeces of doores and windowes. Moreouer, the ancient name of Saint <HI>Michaels Mount,</HI> was <HI>Cara clowse in Cowse,</HI> in English, <HI>The hoare Rocke in the Wood:</HI> which now is at euerie floud incompassed by the Sea, and yet at some low ebbes, rootes of mightie trees are discry|ed in the sands about it. The like ouerflowing hath happened in <HI>Plymmouth</HI> Hauen, and diuers other pla|ces.</P>
<P>In this situation, though nature haue shouldred <NOTE PLACE="marg">Co~modi|ties of the site.</NOTE> out <HI>Cornwall</HI> into the farthest part of the Realme, and so besieged it with the Ocean, that, as a demie Iland in an Iland, the inhabitants find but one way of issue by land: yet hath shee in some good measure, counteruai|led such disaduantage, through placing it, both neere vnto, &amp; in the trade way betwene <HI>Wales, Ireland, Spaine, France, &amp; Netherland.</HI> The neerenesse helpeth the~, with a shorter cut, lesse peril, and meaner charge, to vent forth &amp; make returne of those co~modities, which their owne,
<PB REF="8">
or either of those Countries doe afford: the lying in the way, bringeth forraine shipping to claime succour at their harbours, when, either outward, or homeward bound, they are checked by an East, South, or South|east wind: and where the horse walloweth, some haires will still remaine. Neither is it to bee passed ouer with|out regard, that these remote quarters, lie not so open to the inuasions of forraine enemies, or spoyles of ciuil tumults, as other more inward parts of the Realme, which being seated neerer the heart, are sooner sought, and easlyer ransacked in such troublesome times: or if the Countries long naked sides, offer occasion of lan|ding to any aduerse shipping, her forementioned in|ward naturall strength, increased by so many Lanes and Inclosures, straightneth the same to a preying onely vp|on the outward skirts by some pettie fleetes: For the danger of farder piercing, will require the protection of a greater force for execution, then can there be counter|uailed with the benefit of any bootie, or conquest, were they sure to preuaile. And if to bee free from a dam|mage, may passe for a commoditie, I can adde, that the far distance of this Countie from the Court, hath here|tofore afforded it a Supersedeas from takers &amp; Puruey|ours: for if they should fetch any prouisio~ from thence, well it might be masked with the visard of her Highnes prerogatiue, but the same would verie slenderly turne to the benefit of her Maiesties house keeping: for the foulenesse and vneasinesse of the waies, the little mould of <HI>Cornish</HI> cattel, and the great expence of driuing them, would defaulke as much from the iust price to the Queene, at the deliuering, as it did from the owners at
<PB N="4" REF="8">
the taking. Besides that, her Highnesse shipping should heerethrough bee defrauded of often supplies, which these parts afford vnto them.</P>
<P>Vpon which reasons, some of the Purueyours at|tempts, heretofore through the suite of the Countrie, the sollicitation of Sir <HI>Richard Gremuile,</HI> the credite of the Lord Warden, and the graciousnesse of our Soue|raigne, were reuoked and suppressed, and the same vnder her Highnesse priuie Seale confirmed. Notwith|standing, when her Maiestie made her pleasure after|ward knowne, that shee would haue a generall contri|bution from euerie Shire, for redeeming this exempti|on, <HI>Cornwall</HI> opposing dutie against reason, or rather accompting dutie a reason sufficient, yeelded to vnder|goe a proportionable rate of the burthen. So they com|pounded to furnish ten Oxen after Michaelmas for thirtie pound price: to which, by another agreement with the Officers, they should adde fortie markes of of their owne. Vpon halfe a yeeres warning either par|tie might repent the bargaine. This held for a while: but within a short space, either the carelesnesse of the Iusti|ces in imposing this rate, or the negligence of the Con|stables in collecting it, or the backwardnesse of the In|habitants in paying the same, or all these together ouer|slipped the time, and withheld the satisfaction. Here|on downe comes a Messenger with sharpe letters from the Officers of the Greene cloth. The conclusion en|sued, that his charges must bee borne, and an higher price disbursed for the supplie. Thus it fareth too and fro, and the <HI>Cornishmen</HI> seeme to hold a Wolfe by the eares: for to make payment the people are vnwilling, as in a charge heretofore vnusuall, to vndergoe the mana|ging
<PB REF="9">
hereof, the Iustices strayne courtesie, as in a mat|ter nothing plausible, and appertaining to ouer-many partners, for the well effecting, and yet to breake they are both afraid, suspecting that a heauier load will fol|low, if this composition be once set at large.</P>
<P>These commodities goe not vnaccompanied with their inconueniences: for to <HI>Cornwall</HI> also hath <HI>Pandora's</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Disco~mo|dities of the site.</NOTE> Boxe beene opened. One is, that the farre distance from the higher seates of Iustice, rippeth a wider gap to in|truding iniuries, and increaseth the charge and time of procuring their redresse. Which due occasion of dis|couragement, the worst conditioned, and least cliented Petiuoguers, doe yet (vnder the sweet baite of reuenge) conuert to a more plentiful prosecution of actions. The ordinarie trade of these men is, where they perceiue a sparke of displeasure kindling, to increase the flame with their bellowes of perswasion. Hath such a one abused you, saith he? Anger him a little, that breaking out in|to some outragious words, you may take aduantage thereof; and you shall see how we will hamper him: I warrant you he shall fetch an errand to <HI>London,</HI> &amp; beare part of your charges too. After the game hath beene brought in by this Winlesse, the poore soule is bound not to release his aduersarie, without his Attournies consent, who plieth the matter with so good a stomack, as hee eateth the kernell, whilest they fight about the shell. At last, when the fountaine of his Clients purse is drawne drie, by his extrauagant fees of <HI>Pro consilio, pro expeditione, pro amicitia Vicecomitis. &amp;c.</HI> besides the pack|ing betweene the Vndersheriffe and him, of docketing out Writs neuer sued foorth, the mediation of friends must shut vp the matter in a comprimise. Another dis|commoditie
<PB N="5" REF="9">
groweth, that whereas <HI>London</HI> furnisheth all prouisions (euen Tynne, and such other arising in the same Countrie) of best stuffe, fashion, store, and cheap|nesse: the hard procuring, and farre carriage, addeth an extraordinarie increase of price to the <HI>Cornish</HI> buyers: and for matters of benefit, or preferment, by suits at Court, either the oportunitie is past, before notice can arriue so far: or the following there, and losse the whiles at home, will require a great and assured gaine in the principall, to warrant the hope of a sauing bargaine in the appurtenance.</P>
<P>Touching the temperature of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> the ayre <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tempe|rature.</NOTE> thereof is cleansed, as with bellowes, by the billowes, and flowing and ebbing of the Sea, and therethrough becommeth pure, and subtill, and, by consequence, healthfull. So as the inhabitants doe seldome take 2 ruthful and reauing experience of those harmes, which infectious diseases vse to carrie with them. But yet I haue noted, that this so piercing an ayre, is apter to pre|serue then recouer health, especially in any languishing sicknesse which hath possessed strangers: neither know I, whether I may impute to this goodnesse of the ayre, that vpon the returne of our fleete from the <HI>Portugall</HI> action, 1589. the diseases which the Souldiers brought home with them, did grow more grieuous, as they carried the same farther into the land, then it fell out at <HI>Plymmouth,</HI> where they landed: for there the same was, though infectious, yet not so contagious, and though pestilentiall, yet not the verie pestilence, as afterwards it proued in other places.</P>
<P>The Spring visiteth not these quarters so timely, as <NOTE PLACE="marg">Spring. Summer.</NOTE> the Easterne parts. Summer imparteth a verie tempe|rate
<PB REF="10">
heat; recompencing his slow fostering of the fruits, with their kindly ripening, Autum re bringeth a some|what <NOTE PLACE="marg">Autu~ne.</NOTE> late Harnest specially to the middle of the Shire, where they seldome inne their Corne before Mi|chaelmas. Winter, by reason of the Southes neere <NOTE PLACE="marg">Winter.</NOTE> neighbourhead, and Seas warme breath, fauoureth is with a milder cold then elsewhere, so as, vpon both coastes, the Frost and Snow come verie seldome, and make a speedie departure. This notwithstanding, the Countrie is much subiect to stormes, which fetching a large course in the open Sea, doe from thence vio|lently assault the dwellers at land, and leaue them vnco|uered houses, pared hedges, and dwarfe-growne trees, as witnesses of their force and furie: yea, euen the hard stones, and yron-baires of the windowes, doe fret to be so continually grated. One kind of these stormes, they call a flaw, or flaugh, which is a mightie gale of wind, passing suddainely to the shore, and working strong effects, vpon whatsoeuer it incountreth in his way.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cornish</HI> soyle, for the most part, is lifted vp into <NOTE PLACE="marg">Earth.</NOTE> many hils, some great, some little of quantitie, some steepe, some easie for ascent, and parted in sunder by short and narrow vallies. A shallow earth dooth couer <NOTE PLACE="marg">Forme.</NOTE> their outside, the substance of the rest, consisteth ordi|narily in Rockes and Shelfe, which maketh them hard for manurance, &amp; subiect to a drie Summers parching. The middle part of the Shire (sauing the inclosures a|bout some few Townes and Villages) lieth waste and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Qualitie.</NOTE> open, sheweth a blackish colour, beareth Heath and spirie Grasse, and serueth in a maner, onely to Summer Cattel. That which bordereth vpon either side of the Sea, through the Inhabitants good husbandrie, of in|closing,
<PB N="6" REF="10">
sending, and other dressing, carrieth a better hue, and more profitable qualitie. Meadow ground it affoordeth little, pasture for Cattell and Sheepe, store enough, Corne ground plentie.</P>
<P>Hils of greatest name and height are, <HI>Hinxten, Rowtor,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hils.</NOTE> <HI>Brownwelly, S. Agnes, Haynborough,</HI> the foure <HI>Boroughs, Roche, Carnbray,</HI> and the two <HI>Castellan Danis.</HI></P>
<P>In the rest of this earthy description, I will begin with such mynerals as her bowels yeeld forth, and then passe on to those things, of growing, and feeling life, which vpon her face doe relieue themselues.</P>
<P>These mynerals are not so deepe buried by nature in the entrailes of the earth, nor so closely couched a|mongst <NOTE PLACE="marg">Minerals</NOTE> the Rockes, but that desire of gaine with the instrument of Art can digge them vp: they may bee di|uided into stones and mettals.</P>
<P>Quarrie stones are of sundrie sorts, and serue to di|uers purposes. For walling, there are rough, and <HI>Slate:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Stones.</NOTE> the rough maketh speedier building the <HI>Slate</HI> surer. For Windowes, Dornes, and Chimnies, Moore stone car|rieth chiefest reckoning. That name is bestowed on it, by the Moores or waste ground, where the same is found in great quantitie, either lying vpon the ground, or verie little vnder. This stone answereth the charge of fetching, with the fairenes of his whitish colour, con|taining certaine glimmering sparkles, and counteruai|leth his great hardnesse in working, with the profit of long endurance, nature hauing ordained the same, as of purpose, to withstand the fretting weather. There are also three other sorts of stones, seruing to the same vse, and hewed with lesse, though differing labour: <HI>Pentuan</HI> digged our of the Sea Cliffes, and in colour
<PB REF="11">
somewhat resembleth gray Marble, <HI>Cara<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="bleedthrough" EXTENT="1 span">use</HI> blacke, not vnlike the Ieat, the third taken out of inland Quar|ries, and not much differing from the Easterne free stone.</P>
<P>The Sea strond also in many places, affordeth Pee|ble-stones, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Peeble.</NOTE> which washed out of the earth, or falling from the Rockes, and there lying loose, are, by often rolling of the wanes, wrought to a kind of roundnesse, and serue verie handsomely for pauing of streetes and Courts.</P>
<P>For couering of houses there are three sorts of <HI>Slate,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Slate.</NOTE> which from that vse take the name of Healing-stones. The first and best Blew: the second, Sage-leafe colou|red, the third and meanest Gray. The Blew, and so the rest, are commonly found vnder the walling <HI>Slate,</HI> when the depth hath brought the workmen to the water. This <HI>Slate</HI> is in substance thinne, in colour faire, in waight light, in lasting strong, and generally carrieth so good regard, as (besides the supplie for home prouisi|on) great store is yeerely conucied by shipping both to other parts of the Realme, and also beyond the Seas, in|to <HI>Britaine</HI> and <HI>Netherland.</HI></P>

<P>Touching mettals: Copper is found in sundrie pla|ces, but with what gaine to the searchers, I haue not <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mettals.</NOTE> beene curious to enquire, nor they hastie to reueale. For at one Mine (of which I tooke view) the Owre was

<P>Neither hath nature denyed Siluer to <HI>Cornwall,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Siluer.</NOTE> though <HI>Cieero</HI> excluded the same out of all <HI>Britaine:</HI> and if wee may beleeue our Chroniclers reports, who ground themselues vpon authenticall Records, king <HI>Edward</HI> the first, and king <HI>Edward</HI> the third, reaped some good benefit therof. But for our present experience, what she proffereth with the one hand, shee seemeth to pull backe with the other, whereof some Gentlemen not long sithence, made triall to their losse: howbeit, neither are they discouraged by this successe, nor others from the like attempt.</P>

<P>Yea it is not altogether barren of precious stones, and Pearle: for Dyamonds are in many places found <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dyamo~ds</NOTE> cleauing to those Rockes, out of which the Tynne is digged: they are polished, squared, and pointed by na|ture: their quantitie from a Pease, to a Walnut: in black|nesse and hardnesse they come behind the right ones, and yet I haue knowne some of them set on so good a foile, as at first sight, they might appose a not vnskilfull Lapidarie.</P>
<P>The Pearle (though here not aptly raunged) breed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pearle.</NOTE> in bigge Oysters, and Muscles, greater in quantitie, then acceptable for goodnesse, as neither round nor Orient.

<P>But why seeke wee in corners for pettie commodi|ties, when as the onely mynerall of <HI>Cornish</HI> Tynne, ope|neth <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tynne.</NOTE> so large a field to the Countries benefit? this is in working so pliant, for sight so faire, and in vse so necessa|rie, as thereby the Inhabitants gaine wealth, the Mar|chants trafficke, and the whole Realme a reputation and with such plentie therof hath God stuffed the bow|els of this little Angle, that (as <HI>Astiages</HI> dreamed of his daughter) it ouerfloweth England, watereth Christen|dome, and is deriued to a great part of the world be|sides. In trauailing abroad, in tarrying at home, in ea|ting and drinking, in doing ought of pleasure or ne|cessitie, Tynne, either in his owne shape, or transfor|med into other fashions, is alwayes requisite, alwayes readie for our seruice: but I shall rather disgrace, then endeere it by mine ouer-weake commendation, and sooner tire my selfe, then draw the fountaine of his prai|ses drie. Let this therefore suffice, that it cannot bee of meane price, which hath found, with it, Dyamonds, a|mongst it Gold, and in it Siluer.</P>
<P>The <HI>Cornish</HI> Tynners hold a strong imagination, that in the withdrawing of <HI>Noahs</HI> floud to the Sea, the same tooke his course from East to West, violently breaking vp, and forcibly carrying with it, the earth, trees, and Rocks, which lay any thing loosely, neere the vpper face of the ground. To confirme the likelihood of which supposed truth, they doe many times digge vp whole and huge Timber trees, which they conceiue at that deluge to haue beene ouerturned and whelmed: but whether then, or sithence; probable it is, that some
<PB N="8" REF="12">
such cause produced this effect. Hence it commeth, that albeit the Tynne say couched at first in certaine strakes amongst the Rockes, like a tree, or the veines in a mans bodie, from the depth whereof the maine <HI>Load</HI> sprea|deth out his branches, vntill they approach the open ayre&punc; yet they haue now two kinds of Tynne workes, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Kinds of workes.</NOTE> <HI>Stream,</HI> and <HI>Load:</HI> for (say they) the foremencioned floud, carried together with the moued Rockes and earth, so much of the <HI>Load</HI> as was in closed therein, and at the asswaging, left the same scattered here and there in the vallies and ryuers, where it passed; which being sought and digged, is called <HI>Streamworke:</HI> vnder this title, they comprise also the Moore workes, growing from the like occasion. They maintaine these workes, to haue beene verie auncient, and first wrought by the <HI>Iewes</HI> with Pickaxes of Holme, Boxe, and Harts horne: they prooue this by the name of those places yet endu|ring, to wit, <HI>Attall Sarazin,</HI> in English, the <HI>Iewes offcast,</HI> and by those tooles daily found amongst the rubble of such workes. And it may well be, that as Akornes made good bread, before <HI>Ceres</HI> taught the vse of Corne; and sharpe stones serued the <HI>Indians</HI> for Kniues, vntill the <HI>Spaniards</HI> brought them Iron: so in the infancie of knowledge, these poore instruments for want of better did supplie a turne. There are also taken vp in such works, certaine little tooles heads of Brasse, which some terme Thunder-axes, but they make small shew of any profitable vse. Neither were the <HI>Romanes</HI> ignorant of this trade, as may appeare by a brasse Coyne of <HI>Domiti|an's,</HI> found in one of these workes, and fallen into my hands and perhaps vnder one of those <HI>Flauians,</HI> the <HI>Iewish</HI> workmen made here their first arriuall.</P>
<P><PB REF="13">
They discouer these workes, by certaine Tynne|stones, lying on the face of the ground, which they <NOTE PLACE="marg">Finding the works</NOTE> terme <HI>Shoad,</HI> as shed from the maine <HI>Load,</HI> and made somwhat smooth and round, by the waters washing &amp; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Stream|workes.</NOTE> wearing. Where the finding of these affordeth a temp|ting likelihood, the Tynners goe to worke, casting vp trenches before the~, in depth 5. or 6. foote more or lesse, as the loose ground went, &amp; three or foure in breadth, gathering vp such <HI>Shoad,</HI> as this turning of the earth doth offer to their sight. If any ryner thwart them, and that they resolue to search his bed, hee is trained by a new channell from his former course. This yeeldeth a speedie and gaineful recompence to the aduenturers of the search, but I hold it little beneficiall to the owners of the soyle. For those low grounds, beforetime fruit|full, hauing herethrough their wrong side turned out|wards, accuse the Tynners iniurie by their succeeding barrennesse.</P>
<P>To find the <HI>Loadworkes,</HI> their first labour is also im|ployed in seeking this <HI>Shoad,</HI> which either lieth open on <NOTE PLACE="marg">Load|workes.</NOTE> the grasse, or but shallowly couered. Hauing found any such, they coniecture by the sight of the ground, which way the floud came that brought it thither, and so giue a gesse at the place whence it was broken off. There they <HI>sincke a Shaft,</HI> or pit of fiue or sixe foote in length, two or three foote in breadth, and seuen or eight foote in depth; to proue whether they may so meete with the <HI>Load.</HI> By this <HI>Shaft,</HI> they also discerne which was the quicke ground (as they call it) that mooued with the floud, and which the firme, wherein no such <HI>Shoad</HI> doth lie. If they misse the <HI>Load</HI> in one place, they <HI>sincke</HI> alike <HI>Shaft</HI> in another beyond that, commonly farther
<PB N="9" REF="13">
vp towards the hill, and so a third and fourth, vntil they light at last vpon it. But you may not conceiue, that e|uerie likelyhood doth euer proue a certaintie: for diuers haue beene hindered, through bestowing charges in seeking, and not finding, and many vndone in finding and not speeding, whiles a faire show, tempting them to much cost, hath, in the end, fayled in substance, and made the aduenturers Banckrupt of their hope and purse.</P>
<P>Some haue found Tynne-workes of great vallew, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dreames.</NOTE> through meanes no lesse strange, then extraordinarie, to wit, by dreames. As in <HI>Edward</HI> the sixts time, a Gen|tlewoman, heire to one <HI>Fresculierd,</HI> and wife to <HI>Lauyue,</HI> dreamed, that a man of seemely personage told her, how in such a Tenement of her Land, shee should find so great store of Tynne, as would serue to in rich both her selfe and her posteritie. This shee reuealed to her husband: and hee, putting the same in triall, found a worke, which in foure yeeres, was worth him welneere so many thousand pounds. Moreouer, one <HI>Taprel</HI> lately liuing, &amp; dwelling in the Parish of the hundred of <HI>West,</HI> called <HI>S. Niot,</HI> by a like dreame of his daughter (see the lucke of women) made the like assay, met with the effect, farmed the worke of the vnwitting Lord of the soyle, and grew thereby to good state of wealth. The same report passeth as currant, touching sundrie others; but I will not bind any mans credite, though, that of the Authors haue herein swayed mine and yet he that will afford his eare to Astrologers and naturall Philoso|phers, shall haue it filled with many discourses, of the constellation of the heauens, and the constitution of mens bodies, fitting to this purpose.</P>
<P><PB REF="14">
There are, that leauing these trades of new searching, doe take in hand such old <HI>Stream</HI> and <HI>Loadworks,</HI> as by <NOTE PLACE="marg">New wor|king.</NOTE> the former aduenturers haue beene giuen ouer, and of|tentimes they find good store of Tynne, both in the rubble cast vp before, as also in veines which the first workmen followed not. From hence there groweth a diuersitie in opinion, amongst such Gentlemen, as by iudgement and experience, can looke into these mat|ters; some of them supposing that the Tynne groweth; and others, that it onely separateth from the consumed offall. But whosoeuer readeth that which <HI>Francis Lean|dro</HI> hath written touching the yron mynerals, in the Ile <NOTE PLACE="marg">Deser. Ital.</NOTE> of <HI>Elba,</HI> will cleaue perhaps to a third conceite: for hee auoucheth, that the trenches, out of which the Owre there is digged, within twentie or thirtie yeeres, be|come alike ful againe of the same mettall, as at first, &amp; he confirmeth it by sutable examples, borrowed from <HI>Cle|archus,</HI> of Marble, in <HI>Paros Iland,</HI> and of Salt, in <HI>India,</HI> de|ducing thence this reason, that the ayre and water re|plenishing the voide roome, through the power of the vniuersall agent, and some peculiar celestiall influence, are turned into the selfe substance; and so by conse|quence, neither the Owre groweth, nor the earth con|sumeth away: and this opinio~, <HI>Munster</HI> in his <HI>Cosmogra|phie,</HI> doth seeme to vnderprop, affirming, that neere the Citie of <HI>Apoloxia</HI> in <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> the veines whence Brasse is digged, are filled in like maner. So doth he report, that neere <HI>Ptolomais,</HI> there lieth a round valley, out of which glassie Sand being taken, the winds fill the pit againe, from the vpper part of the adioyning mountaines; which matter is conuerted into the former substance, and that euen Mettals throwne into this place, doe

vndergoe the like <HI>Metamorphosis.</HI></P>
<P>The colour both of the <HI>Shoad</HI> and <HI>Load,</HI> resembleth <NOTE PLACE="marg">Colour.</NOTE> his bed, as the Sea sand doth the Cliffes, and is so di|uersified to reddish, blackish, duskie, and such other earthy colours.</P>
<P><HI>If</HI> the <HI>Load</HI> wherein the Tynne lieth, carrieth a foote <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bignesse.</NOTE> and halfe in breadth, and bee not ouerbarren, it is ac|compted a verie rich worke: but commonly the same exceedeth not a foote, vnlesse many <HI>Loads</HI> runne toge|ther.</P>
<P>When the new found worke intiseth with probabi|litie of profit, the discouerer doth commonly associ|ate <NOTE PLACE="marg">Maner of setting on worke aduen|turers.</NOTE> himselfe with some more partners, because the charge amounteth mostly verie high for any one mans purse, except lined beyond ordinarie, to reach vnto: and if the worke doe faile, many shoulders will more easily support the burthen. These partners consist ei|ther of such Tinners as worke to their owne behoose, or of such aduenturers as put in hired labourers. The hirelings stand at a certaine wages, either by the day, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hire.</NOTE> which may be about eight pence, or for the yeere, being betweene foure and sixe pound, as their deseruing can driue the bargaine: at both which rates they must find themselues.</P>
<P>If the worke carrie some importance, and require the trauaile of many hands, that hath his name, and they their Ouerseer, whome they terme their Captaine: such are the <HI>Pel, Whilancleuth,</HI> in English, <HI>The worke of the Ditches: Pulstean,</HI> that is, <HI>The myrie head: Grueg braaz, The great Borough: Saint Margets,</HI> and many surna|med <HI>Balls,</HI> which betoken the Vales where the works are set on foote.</P>
<P><PB REF="15">
The Captaines office bindeth him to sort ech work|man his taske, to see them applie their labour, to make <NOTE PLACE="marg">Captaine.</NOTE> timely prouision, for binding the worke with frames of Timber, if need exact it, to place Pumpes for drawing of water, and to giue such other directions. In most pla|ces, their toyle is so extreame, as they cannot endure it aboue foure houres in a day, but are succeeded by spels&punc; the residue of the time, they weare out at Coytes, Kayles, or like idle exercises. Their Kalender also allow|eth them more Holy-dayes, then are warranted by the Church, our lawes, or their owne profit.</P>
<P>Their ordinarietooles, are a Pick-axe of yron, about <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tooles.</NOTE> sixteene inches long, sharpned at the one end to pecke, and flat-headed at the other, to driue certaine little yron Wedges, wherewith they cleaue the Rockes. They haue also a broad Shouell, the vtter part of yron, the middle of Timber, into which the staffe is slopewise tastned.</P>
<P>Their maner of working in the Loadmines, is to fol|low the <HI>Load</HI> as it lieth, either sidelong, or downe-right: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Maner of working.</NOTE> both waies the deeper they sincke, the greater they find the <HI>Load</HI> When they light vpon a smal veine, or chance to leese the <HI>Load</HI> which they wrought, by meanes of certaine strings that may hap to crosse it, they begin at another place neere-hand, and so draw by gesse to the maine <HI>Load</HI> againe. If the <HI>Load</HI> lie right downe, they follow it sometimes to the depth of fortie or fiftie fa|thome. These Loadworkes, <HI>Diod. sicl.</HI> 5. <HI>cap.</HI> 8. seemeth to point at, where hee saith, that the Inhabitants of <HI>Ve|lerium Promontorie,</HI> digge vp Tin out of rockie ground. From some of their bottomes you shal at no one dayes discrie the Starres: the workmen are let down and taken
<PB N="11" REF="15">
vp in a Stirrup, by two men who wind the rope.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Load</HI> lie slope-wise, the Tynners digge a con|uenient depth, and then passe forward vnder ground, so farre as the ayre will yeeld them breathing, which, as it beginneth to faile, they <HI>sinke</HI> a <HI>Shaft</HI> downe thither from the top, to admit a renewing vent, which not with|standing, their worke is most by Candle-light. In these passages, they meete sometimes with verie loose earth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Conuey|ance.</NOTE> sometimes with exceeding hard Rockes, and somtimes with great streames of water.</P>
<P>The loose Earth is propped by frames of Timber|worke, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Loose earth.</NOTE> as they go, and yet now and then falling downe, either presseth the poore workmen to death, or stop|peth them from returning. To part the Rockes, they <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rockes.</NOTE> haue the foremencioned Axes, and Wedges, with which, mostly, they make speedie way, and yet (not seldome) are so tied by the teeth, as a good workman shall hardly be able to hew three foote, in the space of so many weekes. While they thus play the Moldwarps, vnsauorie Damps doe here and there distemper their <NOTE PLACE="marg">Damps&punc;</NOTE> heads, though not with so much daunger in the conse|quence, as annoyance for the present.</P>
<P>For conueying away the Water, they pray in aide <NOTE PLACE="marg">Water.</NOTE> of sundry deuices, as Addits, Pumps &amp; wheeles, driuen by a streame, and interchangeably filling, and emptying two Buckets, with many such like: all which notwith|standing, the Springs so incroche vpon these inuenti|ons, as in sundrie places they are driuen to keepe men, and some-where horses also at worke both day &amp; night, without ceasing, and in some all this will not serue the turne.

They cal it the bringing of an Addit, or Audit, when they begin to trench without, and carrie the same tho|row <NOTE PLACE="marg">Addit.</NOTE> the ground to the Tynworke, somewhat deeper then the water doth lie, thereby to giue it passage away.</P>
<P>This Addit, they either fetch athwart the whole <HI>Load,</HI> or right from the braunch where they worke, as the next valley ministreth fittest oportunitie, for soonest cutting into the Hil: and therfore a Gentleman of good knowledges, deduceth this name of Addit, <HI>Ab aditu ad aquas.</HI> Surely the practice is cunning in deuice, costly in charge, and long in effecting and yet, when all is done, many times the <HI>Load</HI> falleth away, and they may sing with <HI>Augustus</HI> bird, <HI>Opera &amp; impensa periit.</HI> If you did see how aptly they cast the ground, for conueying the wa|ter, by compassings and turnings, to shunne such hils &amp; vallies as let them, by their too much height or low|nesse, you would wonder how so great skill could couch in so base a Cabbin, as their (otherwise) thicke clouded braines.</P>
<P>As much almost dooth it exceede credite, that the Tynne, for and in so small quantitie, digged vp with so <NOTE PLACE="marg">Maner of dressing.</NOTE> great toyle, and passing afterwards thorow the mana|ging of so many hands, ere it come to sale, should be any way able to acquite the cost: for being once brought aboue ground in the stone, it is first broken in peeces with hammers; and then carryed, either in waynes, or <NOTE PLACE="marg">Breaking.</NOTE> on horses backs, to a stamping mill, where three, and in <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sta~ping.</NOTE> some places sixe great logges of timber, bound at the ends with yron, and lifted vp and downe by a wheele, driuen with the water, doe breake it smaller. If the stones be ouer-moyst, they are dried by the fire in an y|ron cradle or grate. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Drying.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="16">
From the stamping <HI>mill,</HI> it passeth to the crazing <HI>mil,</HI> which betweene two grinding stones, turned also with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Crazing.</NOTE> a water-wheele, bruseth the same to a fine sand: how be|it, of late times they mostly vse wet stampers, &amp; so haue no need of the crasing <HI>mils</HI> for their best stuffe, but on|ly for the crust of their tayles.</P>
<P>The streame, after it hath forsaken the <HI>mill,</HI> is made <NOTE PLACE="marg">Washing.</NOTE> to fall by certayne degrees one somwhat distant from a|nother; vpon each of which, at euery discent lyeth a greene turfe, three or foure foote square, and one foote thick. On this the Tinner layeth a certayne portion of the sandie Tinne, and with his shouell softly tosseth the same to and fro, that through this stirring, the water which runneth ouer it, may wash away the light earth from the Tinne, which of a heauier substance lyeth fast on the turfe. Hauing so clensed one portion, he setteth the same aside, and beginneth with another, vntil his la|bour take end with his taske. The best of those turfes (for all sorts serue not) are fetched about two miles to the Eastwards of <HI>S. Michaels Mount,</HI> where at a low wa|ter they cast aside the sand, and dig them vp: they are full of rootes of trees, and on some of them nuts haue beene found, which confirmeth my former assertion of the seas intrusion. After it is thus washed, they put the remnant into a woodden dish, broad, flat, and round, being about two foote ouer, and hauing two handles fastened at the sides, by which they softly shogge the same to and fro in the water betweene their legges, as they sit ouer it, vntill whatsoeuer of the earthie sub|stance that was yet left, be flitted away. Some of later time, with a sleighter inuention, and lighter labour, doe cause certaine boyes to stir it vp and downe with their
<PB REF="17">
feete, which worketh the same effect: the residue, after this often clensing, they call blacke Tynne, whichis proportionably diuided to euerie of the aduenturers, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sharing blacke Tynne.</NOTE> when the Lords part hath beene first deducted vpon the whole.</P>
<P>Then doth each man carrie his portion to the blow|ing <NOTE PLACE="marg">Melting.</NOTE> house, where the same is melted with Char-coale fire, blowne by a great paire of Bellowes, mooued with a water-wheele, and so cast into peeces of a long and thicke squarenesse, from three hundred to foure hun|dred pound waight, at which time the owners marke is set thereupon. The last remooue, is to the place of Coynage, which I shall touch hereafter. I haue alrea|die told you, how great charge the Tynner vndergo|eth, before he can bring his <HI>Owre</HI> to this last mill: where|to <HI>if</HI> you adde his care and cost, in buying the wood for this seruice, in felling, framing, and piling it to bee bur|ned, in fetching the same, when it is coaled, through such farre, foule, and cumbersome wayes, to the blow|ing house, together with the blowers, two or three Moneths extreame and increasing labour, sweltring heate, danger of skalding their bodies, burning the hou|ses, casting away the worke, and lastly their vgly coun|tenances, tanned with smoake, and besmeared with sweate: all these things (I say) being duely considered, I know not whether you would more maruaile, either whence a sufficient gaine should arise to counteruaile so manifold expences, or that any gaine could traine men to vndertake such paines and perill. But there let vs leaue them, since their owne will doth bring them thither. During the Tinnes thus melting in the blowing house, diuers light sparkles thereof are by the forcible
<PB N="13" REF="17">
wind, which the bellows sendeth forth, driuen vp to the thatched roofe. For which cause the owners doe once in seuen or eight yeeres, burne those houses, and find so much of this light Tynne in the ashes, as payeth for the new building, with a gainefull ouerplus. A strange practise (certes) for thrifts sake, to set our house on fire: Others doe frame the Tunnels of the Chimnies verie large and slope, therein to harbour these sparkles, and so saue the burning. This casualtie may bee worth the owner some ten pound by the yeere, or better, if his Mil haue store of sutors. But sithence I gathered stickes to the building of this poore nest, <HI>Sir Francis Godol|phin,</HI> (whose kind helpe hath much aduanced this my playing labour) entertained a <HI>Duch</HI> mynerall man, and taking light from his experience, but building thereon farre more profitable conclusions of his owne inuenti|on, hath practised a more sauing way in these matters, and besides, made Tynne with good profit, of that re|fuse which the Tynners reiected as nothing worth.</P>
<P>We will now proceede, to take a view of the orders and customes most generally vsed among the Tynners.</P>
<P>Their workes, both <HI>Streame</HI> and <HI>Load,</HI> lie either in seuerall, or in wasirell, that is, in enclosed grounds, or in cominons. In <HI>Seuerall,</HI> no man can search for Tynne, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Seuerall.</NOTE> without leaue first obtained from the Lord of the soile; who, when any Myne is found, may worke it wholly himselfe, or associate partners, or set it out at a farme certaine, or leaue it vn wrought at his pleasure. In <HI>Wa|strell,</HI> it is lawfull for any man to make triall of his for|tune <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wastrel.</NOTE> that way, prouided, that hee acknowledge the Lordes right, by sharing our vnto him a certaine part, which they call toll: a custome sauouring more of
<PB REF="18">
indifferencie, then the Tynners constitutions in <HI>Deuon,</HI> which inable them to digge for Tynne in any mans ground, inclosed, or vnclosed, without licence, tribute or satisfaction. Wherethrough it appeareth, that the Law-makers rather respected their owne benefit, then equitie, the true touch of all lawes. The <HI>Wastrel</HI> workes are reckoned amongst chattels, and may passe by word or Will. When a Myne is found in any such place, the first discouerer aymeth how farre it is likely to extend, and then, at the foure corners of his limited proporti|on, diggeth vp three Turfes, and the like (if he list) on the sides, which they terme <HI>Bounding,</HI> and within that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bounds.</NOTE> compasse, euery other man is restrained from searching. These bounds he is bound to renew once euerie yeere, as also in most places to bestow some time in Working the Myne, otherwise hee loseth this priuiledge. The worke thus found and bounded, looke how many men doc labour therein, so many <HI>Doales</HI> or shares they make thereof, and proportionably diuide the gaine and char|ges. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Doales.</NOTE> The Lord of the soyle is most-where allowed li|bertie to place one workman in euerie fifteene for him|selfe, at like hand with the aduenturers, if hee be so dis|posed.</P>
<P>They measure their blacke Tynne, by the <HI>Gill,</HI> the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Measure.</NOTE> <HI>Tapliffe,</HI> the <HI>Dish</HI> and the <HI>Foate,</HI> which containeth a pint, a pottell, a gallon, and towards two gallons.</P>

To the hard (lesse worth by fiftie shillings in the thousand then the soft) the letter <HI>H.</HI> is added, e're it come from the blowing house. Each thousand must answere fortie shillings to the Queene, which with the other incident fees being satisfied, then, and not before, it is lawfull for the ow|ner to alienate and distract the same.</P>
<P>But about the price there groweth much adoe, be|tweene the Marchants and the owners, before they can <NOTE PLACE="marg">Price.</NOTE> iumpe to an agreement. The Marchant vnfoldeth his packe of strange newes, which either he brought with him from <HI>London</HI> (where most of them dwell) or for|ged by the way, telling what great likelyhood there is of warres, what danger of Pirates at Sea, how much of the fore-bought Tynne lieth on their hands, &amp;c. The owner, on the other side, stoppeth his eares against these charmes, answeres his newes with the <HI>Spaniards, Credo en Dios,</HI> encounters his reasons, with the present scarci|tie and charges of getting and working Tynne, and so keeping vp the price, <HI>Iniquum petit, vt aequum ferat.</HI> In the end, after much bidding, and louing, varying, and
<PB REF="19">
delaying, commonly that Marchant who hath most money to bestow, and that owner who hath most Tynne to sell, doe make the price, at which rate the Marchant is bound to yeeld present payment for so much Tynne as shall be brought him, and, of necessi|tie, must bargaine for tenne thousand at the least. Others notwithstanding are not bound to buy or sell at this price, but euerie man left at libertie, to make his best market.</P>
<P>The Tynne so sold, hath vsually amounted hereto|fore to the worth of thirtie or fortie thousand pound in money, and carried price betweene twentie and thirtie pound the thousand, sometimes higher and sometimes lower, according to the quicke vent and aboundance, or the dead sale and scarcitie; wherein yet some haue ob|serued, that this so profitable, and vendible a marchan|dize, riseth not to a proportionable enhauncement, with other lesse beneficiall, and affected commodities, and they impute it partly to the Easterne buyers pack|ing, partly to the owners not venting, and venturing the same.</P>
<P>Here I must either craue or take leaue of the <HI>Londo|ners,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tynne V|surie of Marcha~t Londo|ners.</NOTE> to lay open the hard dealing of their Tynne Mar|chants in this trade. Whe~ any Western Gent. or person of accompt, wanteth money to defray his expences at <HI>London,</HI> he resorteth to one of the Tynne Marchants of his acquaintance, to borrow some: but they shall as soone wrest the Clubbe out of <HI>Hercules</HI> fist, as one pe|nie out of their fingers, vnlesse they giue bond for eue|rie twentie pound so taken in lone, to deliuer a thou|sand pound waight of Tyn at the next Coynage, which shal be within two or three months, or at farthest with|in
<PB N="15" REF="19">
halfe a yeere after. At which time the price of euerie thousand, will not faile to be at least twentie three, pre|haps twentie fiue pound: yea, and after promise made, the party must be driuen (with some indignitie) to make three or foure errands to his house, or hee shall get the money deli<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="damage" EXTENT="1 letter">ered. In this sort, some one Marchant will haue 5. hundred pound out beforehand, reaping there|by a double commoditie, both of excessiue gaine for his lone, and of assurance to bee serued with Tynne for his money. This they say is no <HI>Vsurie,</HI> forsooth, because the price of Tynne is not certainely knowne before|hand: (for once onely within these twelue yeeres, of set purpose to escape the penaltie of the Law, they brought it a little vnder twentie pound the thousand:) but if to take aboue fiftie in the hundred be extremitie, whatso|euer name you list to giue it, this in truth can bee none other, then cutthroate and abominable dealing. I will not condemne all such as vse this trade, neither yet ac|quite those who make greatest pretence of zeale in Re|ligion: and it may be, that some vpon by-respects, find somwhat friendly vsage in <HI>Vsance,</HI> at some of their hands: but the common voice saith, that <HI>for the most part, they are naught all.</HI></P>
<P>And yet how bad soeuer this fashion may iustly bee <NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Coun|trie dwel|lers.</NOTE> accompted, certaine of the same Countrymen do passe farre beyond it, as thus: The Marchant, that hee may stand assured to haue Tynne for his money, at the time of <HI>Coynage</HI> or deliuerance, besides his trade of lone a|bouementioned, layeth out diuers summes before|hand, vnto certaine <HI>Cornishmen,</HI> owners of Tynworkes, or otherwise of knowne sufficiencie, who are bound to deliuer for the same, so many thousands of Tynne, as
<PB REF="20">
the money shal amount vnto, after the price agreed vp|on at the <HI>Coynages.</HI> To these hungrie flies, the poore la|bouring Tynner resorteth, desiring some money be|fore the time of his pay at the deliuerance: the other puts him off at first, answering he hath none to spare: in the end, when the poore man is driuen through neces|sitie to renew his suite, he fals to questioning, what hee will doe with the money. Saith the Tynner, I will buy bread and meate for my selfe and my houshold, and shooes, hosen, peticoates, &amp; such like stuffe for my wife and children. Suddenly herein, this owner becomes a pettie chapman: I will serue thee saith he: hee deliuers him so much ware as shall amount to fortie shillings, in which he cuts him halfe in halfe for the price, and foure nobles in money, for which the poore wretch is bound in <HI>Darbyes</HI> bonds, to deliuer him two hundred waight of Tynne at the next Coynage, which may then bee worth fiue pound or foure at the verie least. And as mis|chiefe still creepes onward, this extreme dealing of the <HI>London</HI> Marchant and Countrie chapman, in white Tynne is imitated (or rather exceeded) by the weal|thier sort of Tynners themselues in the blacke, by lay|ing out their money after thus much the marke: which trade, though subtill and darke, I will open as plainely as I can.</P>
<P>A foote of blacke Tynne (as is before said) contai|neth in measure two gallons; the waight vncertainely followeth the goodnesse, A foote of good Moore-tyn, (which is counted the best sort) will way about foure|score pound. Of the Myne Tynne (which is meaner) fiftie two pound: of the worst fiftie pound. Two pound of good blacke Tynne, being melted, will yeeld one of
<PB N="16" REF="20">
white: twentie eight or thirtie foote of the best, fortie: of the middle, 52. of the meanest, a thousand. Now the wealthier sort of Tynners, laying out part of their money beforehand, buy this black Tynne of the poore labourers, after so much the marke: that is, looke how many markes there are in the price, made at the <HI>Coy|nage</HI> for the thousand, so many two pence halfepenie, three pence, or foure pence, partly after the goodnesse, and partly according to the hard conscience of the one, and necessitie of the other, shal he haue for the foote: as if the price be twentie sixe pound, thirteene shillings &amp; foure pence the thousand, therein are fortie markes: then shall the poore Tynner receiue of him who dea|leth most friendly, for euerie foote of his best blacke tynne (of which as was said, about thirtie will make a thousand) fortie times foure pence; <HI>viz.</HI> thirteene shil|lings and foure pence, which amounteth to twentie pound the thousand: whereas that foote at the price, is worth aboue fiue pence the marke. Likewise will hee pay for the meaner blacke Tynne (of which about for|tie foote will make a thousand) three pence the marke, which is ten shillings the foote, and so shall he haue al|so after twentie pound for the thousand: for the worse they giue lesse, rateably. By which proportion, how vncertaine soeuer the goodnesse of the Tynne, or the greatnesse of the price do fall, their gaine of a fourth part at least riseth alwaies vncertainly. Whereto adding, that they lay out beforehand but a portion of the money due, and that onely for some small time, you shall find it grow to the highest degree of extremitie.</P>
<P>But whether it proceedeth from this hard dealing, or for that the Tynners whole familie giue themselues
<PB REF="21">
to a lazie kind of life, and depend only vpon his labour and gaynes; which often ill succeeding aduentures, &amp; such ouer-deare bought Tynne daylie impaire, or from both these together; once it hath beene duly ob|serued, that the parishes where Tynne is wrought, rest in a meaner plight of wealth, then those which want this dammageable commoditie: and that as by abando|ning this trade, they amend, so by reuiuing the same, they decay againe; whereas husbandrie yeeldeth that certayne gaine in a mediocritie, which Tynneworkes rather promise, then performe in a larger measure.</P>
<P>Let vs now examine what course of Iustice is held for deciding such controuersies as befall in Tinne cau|ses, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Priuile|ges, and course of Iustice for Tynne causes.</NOTE> and with what priuileges they are endowed and encouraged.</P>
<P>After such time as the Iewes by their extreame dea|ling had worne themselues, first out of the loue of the English Inhabitants, and afterwards out of the land it selfe, and so left the Mines vnwrought, it hapned, that certaine Gentlemen, being Lords of seuen tithings in <HI>Blackmoore,</HI> whose grounds were best stored with this Minerall, grewe desirous to renew this benefit: and so vpon suit made to <HI>Edmond</HI> Earle of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> sonne to <HI>Richard</HI> king of the <HI>Romans,</HI> they obtayned from him a Charter, vvith sundrie Priuileges: amongst vvhich, it <NOTE PLACE="marg">Charter.</NOTE> vvas graunted them to keepe a Court, and hold plea of all actions, life, lymme, and land excepted: in conside|ration vvhereof, the sayd Lords accorded to pay the Earle a halfpeny for euery pound of Tynne which should be wrought; and that for better answering this taxe, the sayd Tynne should bee brought to certayne places purposely appointed, and there peized, coyned,
<PB N="17" REF="21">
and kept, vntill the Earles due were satisfied. Againe, the Lords of these Tithings, were, for their parts, au|thorised to manage all Stannerie causes, and, for that intent, to hold Parliaments at their discretion, and in regard of their labour, there was allotted vnto them the toll-Tynne within those Tithings, which their succes|sours doe yet enioy. This Charter was to be kept in one of the Church steeples, within those Tithings, and the Seale had a Pick-axe and Shouell in faultier grauen therein. This I receiued by report of the late master <HI>William Carnsew,</HI> a Gentleman of good qualitie, discre|tion, and learning, and well experienced in these my|nerall causes, who auouched himselfe an eye-witnesse of that Charter, though now it bee not extant. How|beit, I haue learned, that in former time, the Tynners obtained a Charter from king <HI>Iohn,</HI> and afterwards an|other from king <HI>Edward</HI> the first, which were againe expounded, confirmed and inlarged by Parliament, in the fiftieth yeere of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and lastly streng|thened by king <HI>Henrie</HI> the seuenth.</P>
<P>King <HI>Edward</HI> the firsts Charter, granteth them liberty of selling their Tynne, to their best behoofe. <HI>Nisi</HI> (saith he) <HI>nos ipsi emere voluerimus.</HI> Vpon which ground cer|taine persons in the Reignes of K. <HI>Edward</HI> 6. &amp; Queene <HI>Marie,</HI> sought to make vse of this preemption, (as I <NOTE PLACE="marg">Preemp|tion.</NOTE> haue beene enformed) but either crossed in the prose|cution, or defeated in their expectation, gaue it ouer againe which vaine successe; could not yet discourage some others of later times from the like attempt, allead|ging many reasons how it might proue beneficiall both to her Highnesse and the Countrie, and preiudiciall to none saue onely the Marchants, who practised a farre
<PB REF="22">
worse kind of preemption, as hath beene before ex|pressed. This for a while was hotely onsetted and a rea|sonable price offered, but (vpon what ground I know not) soone cooled againe. Yet afterwards it receiued a second life, and at Michaelmas terme 1599. the <HI>Cor|nishmen,</HI> then in <HI>London,</HI> were called before some of the principal Lords of her Maiesties Council, and the mat|ter there debated, by the Lord Warden, in behalfe of the Countrie, and certaine others deputed for the Mar|chants, who had set this suite on foote. In the end it grew to a conclusion, and Articles were drawne and signed, but they also proued of void effect.</P>
<P>Last of all, the said Lord Warden, in the beginning of Nouember 1600. called an assembly of Tynners at <HI>Lostwithiel,</HI> the place accustomed, impanelled a Iurie of twentie foure Tynners, signified her Maiesties pleasure both for a new imposition of sixe pound on euerie thousand, that should bee transported (ouer and aboue the former fortie shillings, and sixteene shillings alrea|die payable) as also that her Highnesse would disburse foure thousand pound in lone to the Tynners, for a yeres space, and bee repayed in tynne at a certaine rate.</P>
<P>By the foreremembred ancient Charters, there is assigned a Warden of the Stanneries, who supplieth the place, both of a Iudge for Law, and of a Chauncellour for conscience, and so taketh hearing of causes, either in <HI>Forma iuris, or de iure &amp; aequo.</HI> Hee substituteth some Gentlemen in the Shire of good calling and discretion, to be his <HI>Vice-Warden,</HI> from whome either partie, com|plainant or defendant, may appeare to him, as from him (a case of rare experience) to the Lords of the Coun|cill, and from their Honours to her Maiesties person:
<PB N="18" REF="22">
other appeale or remoouing to the common law they gaynsay.</P>
<P>The Gayle for <HI>Stannery</HI> causes is kept at <HI>Lostwithiel,</HI> and that office is annexed to the Comptrolership. <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gayle.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Tynners of the whole shire are deuided into <NOTE PLACE="marg">Quarters</NOTE> foure quarters, two called <HI>Moores,</HI> of the places where the Tynne is wrought, <HI>viz. Foy moore,</HI> and <HI>Blacke moore:</HI> the other, <HI>Tiwarnaill</HI> and <HI>Penwith.</HI> To each of these is assigned by the L. Warden, a Steward, who keepeth his Court once in euery three weekes. They are termed <HI>Stannery</HI> Courts, of the latine word <HI>Stannum,</HI> in English Tynne, and hold plea of whatsoeuer action of debt or trespasse, whereto any one dealing with blacke or white Tynne, either as plaintife or defendant, is a party. Their maner of triall consisteth in the verdict giuen by a Iurie <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iuries.</NOTE> of sixe Tynners, according to which the Steward pro|nounceth iudgement. He that will spare credit to the common report, shall conceiue an ill opinion touching the slippings of both witnesses and Iurours sometimes in these Courts: For it is sayd, that the witnesses haue not sticked now and then to fasten their euidence, rather for seruing a turne, then for manifesting a truth, and that the Iurours verdict hath sauoured more of affection then of reason, especially, in controuersies growne be|tweene strangers and some of the same parts. And such fault-finders voutch diuers causes of this partialitie: One, that when they are sworne, they vse to adde this word, <HI>my conscience,</HI> as the <HI>Romans</HI> did their <HI>Ex animi mei|sententia,</HI> which is suspected to imply a conceyted en|largement of their othe. Another, that the varietie of customes, which in euery place (welneere) differ one from another, yeeldeth them in a maner an vnlimited
<PB REF="23">
scope, to auerre what they list, and so to close the best Lawyers mouth with this one speach, <HI>Our custome is con|trary.</HI> And lastly, that they presume vpon a kind of impu|nity, because these sixe mens iuries fall not within com|passe of the Star-chambers censure, and yet the L. War|dens haue now &amp; then made the pillory punishment of some, a spectacle, example, and warning to the residue. For mine owne part, I can in these Tynne cases, plead but a hearesay experience, and therefore will onely in|ferre, that as there is no smoke without a fire, so com|monly the smoke is far greater then the fire. Strange it were, and not to be excepted, that all poore Tynne Iu|rours and witnesses, should in such a remote corner al|wayes conforme themselues to the precise rule of vp|rightnesse, when we see in the open light of our publike assises, so many more iudicious and substantiall persons now and then to swarue from the same.</P>
<P>In matters of important consequence, appertayning to the whole <HI>Stannery,</HI> the L. Warden, or his Vnder|warden, vseth to impannell a Iury of foure and twenty principall Tynners, which consist of sixe out of euery quarter, returnable by the Maiors of the foure <HI>Stanne|ry</HI> townes, and whose acts doe bind the residue.</P>

Of herbes and rootes for the pot and medicine, <HI>Cornishmen</HI> enioy a like portion in proportion with o|ther <NOTE PLACE="marg">Herbes.</NOTE> Shires, which somewhere also receiueth an in|crease by the sowing &amp; planting of such as are brought thither from beyond the seas.

<P>In times past, the <HI>Cornish</HI> people gaue themselues principally, (and in a maner wholly) to the seeking of Tynne, and neglected husbandry: so as the neigh|bours of <HI>Deuon</HI> and <HI>Sommerset</HI> shires, hired their pastures at a rent, and stored them with theyr owne cattell.</P>
<P>As for tillage; it came farre short of feeding the Inha|bitants mouthes, who were likewise supplyed weekely at their markets from those places, with many hun|dred quarters of corne and horseloades of bread. But when the Tynne workes began to fayle, and the people to increase, this double necessitie draue them to play the good husbands, and to prouide corne of their owne. Labour brought plentie, plentie, cheapnesse, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Corne.</NOTE> and cheapnesse sought a vent beyond the seas, some by procuring licence, and more by stealth (if at least the common brute doe not wrong them with a slaunder)
<PB REF="24">
so as, had not the <HI>Imbargo</HI> with <HI>Spaine</HI> (whither most was transported) foreclosed this trade, <HI>Cornwall</HI> was likely in few yeeres, to reape no little wealth by the same. And yet, whosoeuer looketh into the endeuour which the <HI>Cornish</HI> husbandman is driuen to vse about <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dressing the groud</NOTE> his Tillage, shall find the trauell painefull, the time te|dious, and the expences verie chargeable. For first, a|bout May, they cut vp all the grasse of that ground, which must newly be broken, into Turfes, which they <NOTE PLACE="marg">Breaking.</NOTE> call Beating. These Turfes they raise vp somewhat in the midst, that the wind and Sunne may the sooner drie them. The inside turned outwards drieth more spee|dily, but the outside can better brooke the change of weather. After they haue beene throughly dried, the Husbandman pileth them in little heapes, and so bur|neth them to ashes.</P>
<P>Then doe they bring in Sea sand, of greater or lesser <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sanding.</NOTE> quantitie, partly after their neerenesse to the places, from which it is fetched, and partly by the good hus|bandrie, and abilitie of the Tiller. An ordinarie Horse wil carrie two sackes of Sand, and of such the borderers on the Sea, doe bestow, 60. at least, in euerie Acre, but most Husbands double that number. The Inland soyle requireth not so large a proportion, and in some places, they sow it almost as thinne as their Corne: for if they should strow the same verie thicke, the ground would become ouer-rancke, and choke the Corne with weeds. A little before plowing time, they scatter abroad those Beat-boroughs, &amp; small Sand heapes vpon the ground, which afterwards, by the Ploughes turning downe, giue heate to the roote of the Corne. The tillable fields are in some places so hilly, that the Oxen can hardly
<PB N="20" REF="24">
take sure footing; in some, so tough, that the Plough will scarcely cut them, and in some so shelfie, that the Corne hath much adoe to fasten his roote. The char|ges of this Beating, Burning, Scoding and Sanding, or|dinarily amounteth to no lesse then twentie shillings for euerie Acre: which done, the Tiller can common|ly take but two crops of Wheate, and two of Oates, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Crops.</NOTE> and then is driuen to giue it at least seuen or eight yeres leyre, and to make his breach elsewhere.</P>
<P>Of Wheate there are two sorts, French, which is bearded, and requireth the best soyle, recompencing <NOTE PLACE="marg">Kinds of graine.</NOTE> the same with a profitable plentie: and Notwheate, so termed, because it is vnbearded, contented with a mea|ner earth, and contenting with a suteable gaine.</P>
<P>Rye is employed onely on those worst grounds, which will beare no Wheate. Barley is growne into great vse of late yeeres, so as now they till a larger quantitie in one Hundred, then was in the whole Shire before: and of this, in the deare seasons past, the poore found happie benefit, for they were principally relie|ued, and the labourers also fed, by the bread made thereof; whereas otherwise, the scarcitie of Wheate fel out so great, that these must haue made many hungrie meales, and those out-right haue starued. In the West|erne-most parts of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> they carrie their Barley to the Mill, within eight or nine weekes from the time that they sowed it; such an hastie ripening do the bor|dering Seas afford. This increase of Barley tillage, hath also amended the <HI>Cornish</HI> drinke, by conuerting that gaine into Mault, which (to the il relishing of strangers) informer times they made onely of Oates.</P>
<P>I haue beene alwayes prone to maintaine a <HI>Paradox,</HI>
<PB REF="25">
that dearth of corne in <HI>Cornwall</HI> (for with other Shires I will not vndertake to meddle) so it go not accompani|ed with a scarcitie, is no way preiudiciall to the good of the Countrie; and I am induced thus to thinke, for the reasons ensuing: There are no two trades, which set so many hands on worke, at all times of the yeere, as that one of Tillage. The Husband man finding profit herein, is encouraged to bestow paines and charges, for enclosing and dressing of waste grounds, which there|through afterwardes become also good for pasture. With the readie money, gotten by his weekely selling of corne, he setteth the Artificer on worke, who were better to buy deare bread, being but a part of his meate, and which he cou~teruaileth againe, by raising the price of his ware, then to sit idly, knocking his heeles against the wall. Their obiection, who feare least the transpor|ting of much away, will leaue too little at home, I an|swere with this obseruation: When the price of corne falleth, men generally giue ouer surplus Tillage, and breake no more ground, then will serue to supplie their owne turne: the rest, they imploy in grazing, where|through it falleth out, that an ill kerned or saued Har|uest, soone emptieth their old store, &amp; leaueth them in necessity, to seeke new reliefe from other places. Where|as on the other side, if through hope of vent, they hold on their larger tillage, this retaineth one yeeres prouisi|on vnder-hand, to fetch in another, which vpon such occasions, my easily bee left at home: and of this, what <HI>Cornishman</HI> is there, that hath not seene the experience?</P>

Walnuts, though the meaner sort come short, the Gen|tlemen step not farre behind those of other parts; ma|ny of them conceiuing like delight to graffe and plant, and the soyle yeelding it selfe as ready to receyue and foster. Yet one speciall priuiledge, which the neerenesse to the South, the fitnesse of some grounds standing vp|on lyme stones, the wel growing of Vines, and the plea|sant taste of their Grapes, doe seeme to graunt, I haue not hitherto knowne by any to bee put in practise, and that is, the making of Wines: the triall would require little cost, and (perhaps) requite it with great aduan|tage.</P>

The East quarters of the Shire are not desti|tute of Copswoods, nor they of (almost) on intolera|ble <NOTE PLACE="marg">Woods.</NOTE> price: but in most of the West, either nature hath denyed that co~modity, or want of good husbandry lost it.

For he hauing got|ten one of that kind, and broken out his teeth (wherein consisteth his venome) vsed to carrie him about in his bosome, to set him to his mouth, to make him licke his spittle, &amp; when he came amongst Gentle women, would cast him out suddenly, to put them in feare: but in the end, their vaine dread proued safer then his foole-hardi|nesse: for as he once walked alone, and was kissing this gentle playfellow, the <HI>Snake</HI> in good earnest, with a stumpe, either newly growne vp, or not fully pulled out, bit him fast by the tongue, which therewith began so to rankle and swell, that by the time hee had knocked this foule player on the head, &amp; was come to his place of a|bode, his mouth was scarce able to contayne it. Fayne

<P>Of all maner vermine, <HI>Cornish</HI> houses are most pes|tred <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rats.</NOTE> with <HI>Rats,</HI> a brood very hurtfull for deuouring of meat, clothes, and writings by day; and alike cumber|some through their crying and ratling, while they daunce their gallop gallyards in the roofe at night.</P>
<P>Strangers, at their first comming into the West parts, doe complayne that they are visited with the slowe <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lice.</NOTE> sixe-legged walkers, and yet the cleanely home-borne finde no such annoyance.

<P>The other beastes which <HI>Cornewall</HI> breedeth, serue either for Venerie, or meate, or necessary vses.

But since the grounds began to receiue enclosure and dressing for Tillage, the nature of the soyle hath altered to a better graine, and yeeldeth nou|rishment in greater aboundance, and goodnesse, to the beastes that pasture thereupon: So as, by this meanes (and let not the owners commendable industrie, turne to their surcharging preiudice, least too soone they grow wearie of well doing) <HI>Cornish</HI> Sheepe come but little behind the Easterne flockes, for bignes of mould, finenesse of Wooll, often breeding, speedie fatting, and price of sale, and in my conceyte equall, if not ex|ceede them in sweetnesse of taste, and freedome from rottennesse and such other contagions. As for their number, while euerie dweller hath some, though none keepe many, it may summe the totall to a iolly rate.

<P>The <HI>Cornish</HI> horses, commonly are hardly bred, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Horses.</NOTE> coursely fed, low of stature, quicke in trauell, and (af|ter their growth and strength) able inough for conti|nuance: which sort proue most seruiceable for a rough and hilly Countrie. But verie few of them (through the owners fault) retaine long this their naturall good|nesse. For after two yeeres age, they vse them to carrie sackes of Sand, which boweth downe, and weakneth their backes, and the next Summer they are imployed in harrowing, which marreth their pace. Two meanes that so quaile also their stomackes, and abate their strength, as the first rider findeth them ouer-broken to his hands. Howbeit now, from naught, they are almost come to nought: For since the Statute 12. of <HI>Henry</HI> the eight, which enableth euerie man to seize vpon horses that pastured in Commons, if they were vnder a cer|taine sise, the Sherifes officers, reckoning themselues specially priuiledged to poll in their masters yeere, haue of late times, whether by his commandement, or suffe|rance, accustomed to driue those waste grounds, and to seize on those not voluntariestatute-breaking Tits, so as nature denying a great harace, and these carrying a|way the little, is resteth, that hereafter, not the dammes Foale, but the dames Trottens, be trusted vnto. This co~|sideration
<PB REF="29">
hath made me entertaine a concelte, that or|dinarie Husbandmen should doe well to quit breeding of Horses and betake themselues to Moyles: for that is <NOTE PLACE="marg">Moyles.</NOTE> a beast, which will fare hardly, liue verie long, drawe indifferently well, and carrie great burdens, and hath also a pace swift, and casie enough, for their Mill and market seruice. By which meanes, looke what is abated from the vsuall number of Hacknies, should (with a gainefull recompence) be added to their goodnes: and hereof this quarter hath alreadie taken some experi|ment. For, not long sithence, it hapned that one brought ouer an hee Asse, from <HI>France,</HI> because of the strangenesse of the beast (as euerie thing where it comes first, serues for a wonder) who following his kind, be|gat many monsters, <HI>viz.</HI> Moyles, and for monsters in|deed, the Countrie people admired them, yea, some were so wise, as to knocke on the head, or giue away this issue of his race, as vncouth mongrels.</P>

for Springles to take them.

After hauing thus laid open euerie particular of the land, naturall order leadeth my next labour, to bee im|ployed about the water, and the things incident there|unto: <NOTE PLACE="marg">Water.</NOTE> the water I seuer into fresh and salt.</P>
<P>Touching fresh Water, euerie hill wel-neere sen|deth <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fresh springs.</NOTE> forth plentifull, fresh, cleare, and pleasant springs, all profitable for moystning the ground, and whole|some for mans vse, &amp; diuers by running through veines of mettals, supposed also medicinable for sundrie disea|ses; of which more in their particular places. These springs, (as seuerall persons assembling, make a multi|tude) take aduantage of the falling grounds, to vnite in a greater strength, and beget Ryuers, which yet are more <NOTE PLACE="marg">Riuers.</NOTE> in number, and swifter in course, then deepe in bot|tome, or extended in largenesse. For they worke out their bed through an earth, full of Rockes and stones, suting therethrough, the nature onely of some speciall fishes, of which kind are, Minowes, Shoats, Eeles, and Lampreys. The rest are common to other Shires, but the <HI>Shote</HI> in a maner peculiar to <HI>Deuon</HI> and <HI>Cornwall,</HI> in shape and colour he resembleth the Trowt: howbeit in bignesse and goodnesse, commeth farre behind him.

<P>Of fresh water Ponds, either cast out by nature, or <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ponds.</NOTE> wrought out by Art, <HI>Cornwall</HI> is stored with verie few, though the site of so many narrow vallies offereth ma|ny,

<P>Amongst other commodities affoorded by the sea, the Inhabitants make vse of diuers his creekes, for griste-milles, by thwarting a bancke from side to side, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Salt mils.</NOTE> in which a floud-gate is placed with two leaues: these the flowing tyde openeth, and after full sea, the waight of the ebbe closeth fast, which no other force can doe: and so the imprisoned water payeth the ransome of dryuing an vnder-shoote wheele for his enlarge|ment.</P>
<P>Ilands, <HI>S. Nicholas</HI> in the mouth of <HI>Plymmouth, S. George</HI> before <HI>Loo, S. Michaels</HI> Mount, and the Iles of <HI>Scilley.</HI></P>

<P>Diuers of these are dayly much endammaged by the earth which the Tynners cast vp in their working, and the rayne floods wash downe into the riuers, from
<PB N="27" REF="31">
whence it is discharged in the hauens, and shouldreth the sea out of his ancient possession, or at least, encro|cheth vpon his depth. To remedy this, an Act of Par|liament was made 23.

<P>Yet this earth being through such meanes conuerted into sand, enricheth the husbandman equally with that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Saud.</NOTE> of <HI>Pactolus:</HI> for after the sea hath seasoned it with his salt and fructifying moysture, his waues worke vp to the shore a great part thereof (together with more of his owne store, grated from the cliffes) and the Tillers, some by Barges and Boats, others by horses and waines, doe fetch it, &amp; therewith dresse their grounds. This sand is of diuers kindes, colours, and goodnesse: the kinds, some bigger, some lesser; some hard, some easie. The colours are answereable to the next Cliffes. The goodnesse increaseth as it is taken farther out of the Sea.</P>
<P>Some haue also vsed to carry vp into their grounds the Ose or salt water mudde, and found good profit thereby, though not equalling the sand.</P>
<P>To this purpose also serueth Orewood, which is a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Orewood</NOTE> weed either growing vpon the rockes vnder high water marke, or broken from the bottome of the sea by rough weather, and cast vpon the next shore by the wind and flood. The first sort is reaped yeerely, and thereby bet|tereth in quantity and qualitie: the other must be ta|ken when the first tyde bringeth it, or else the next

Some accustomed to burne it on heapes in pits at the cliffe side, and so conuerted the same to a kind of wood, but the noy some fauour hath cursed it out of the countrey. This Floteore is now and then found naturally formed like rufs, combs, and such like: as if the sea would equall vs in apparel, as it resembleth the land for all sorts of liuing creatures.</P>
<P>The sea strond is also strowed with sundry fashioned <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Shelles</HI> &amp; <HI>Nuts.</HI></NOTE> &amp; coloured shels, of so diuersified and pretty workman|ship, as if Nature were for her pastime disposed to shew her skilin trifles. With these are fou~d moreouer, certain Nuts, some what resembling a sheepes kidney, saue that they are flatter: the outside consisteth of a hard darke coloured rinde: the inner part, of a kernell voyd of any paste, but not so of vertue, especially for women trauay|ling in childbirth, if at least, old wiues tales may deserue any credit. If I become blame-worthy in speaking of such toyes, <HI>Scipio</HI> and <HI>Lelius</HI> shall serue for my patrons, who helde it no shame to spend time in their gathe|ring.</P>
<P>But to carie you from these trifles, you shall vnder|stand, that <HI>Cornewall</HI> is stored with many sorts of ship|ping, (for that terme is the <HI>genus</HI> to them all) namely, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Shipping.</NOTE> they haue Cock-boats for passengers, Sayn-boats for ta|king of Pilcherd, Fisher-boates for the coast, Barges for sand, Lighters for burthen, and Barkes and Ships for trafficke: of all which seuerally to particularize, were <HI>consectari minutias,</HI> and therefore I will omit to discourse of them, or of the wrackes proceeding from them, to their great dammage, and the finders petty benefit, to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wracke.</NOTE> whom, he that in ioyeth the Admirals right, by the com|mon

custome alloweth a moytie for his labour.</P>
<P>But though I shunne tediousnesse herein, I feare lest <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fish.</NOTE> I shal breede you <HI>Nauseam,</HI> while I play the fishmonger: and yet, so large a commoditie may not passe away in silence. I will therefore, with what briefnes I can, shew you, what they are, when they come, where they haunt, with what baite they may be trayned, with what engine taken, and with what dressing saued.</P>
<P>Herein we will first begin with the Peall, Trowt, and Sammon, because they partake of both salt and fresh water, breeding in the one, and liuing in the o|ther.</P>
<P>The Trowte and Peall come from the Sea, be|tweene <NOTE PLACE="marg">Trowte &amp; Peall.</NOTE> March and Midsummer, and passe vp into the fresh ryuers, to shed their spawne. They are mostly ta|ken with a hooke-net, made like the Easterne Weelyes, which is placed in the stickellest part of the streame (for there the fish chiefely seeketh passage) and kept abroad with certaine hoopes, hauing his smaller end fastned against the course of the water, and his mouth open to receiue the fish, while he fareth vp by night.</P>
<P>The Sammons principall accesse, is betweene Mi|chaelm <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sammons</NOTE> as and Christmas: for then, and not before, the ryners can afford them competent depth. A time for|bidden to take them in, by the Statute thirteene of <HI>Ri|chard</HI> the second: but if they should bee allowed this priuiledge in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> the Inhabitants might vtterly quit all hope of good by them, for the rest of the yeere. They are refettest (that is fattest) at their first comming from the Sea, and passe vp as high as any water can car|rie them, to spawne the more safely, and, to that end, take aduantage of the great raynie flouds. After Christ|mas,
<PB REF="33">
they returne to the Sea, altogether spent &amp; out of season, whome, as the spring time commethon, their fry doe follow: and it hath beene obserued, that they (as also the Trowt and Peall) haunt the same ryuers where they first were bred. Vpon the North coast, and to the Westwards of <HI>Foy,</HI> few or none are take~, either through those ryuers shallownesse, or their secret dislike. To catch them, sundrie deuices are put in practise: one is, with the hooke and line, where they vse Flies for their baite: another, with the Sammon speare, a weapon like <HI>Neptunes</HI> Mace, bearded at the points. With this, one standeth watching in the darke night, by the deepe pooles, where the Sammons worke their bed for spaw|ning, while another maketh light with a waze of reed. The Sammon naturally resorteth to the flame, playing in and out, and there through is discerned, strooken and drawne on land by a cord fastned to the speare. The third and more profitable meanes of their taking, is by hutches. A head of Fagots, or stones, is made acrosse theryuer, and his greatest part let out, through a square roome therein, whose vpper side giueth passage to the water by a grate, but denieth it to the fish, and the lower admitteth his entrie, thorow certaine thicke laths, cou|ched slope-wise one against another, but so narrowly, as he can find no way of returne, while the streame tosseth him hither and thither, and the laths ends gall him, if he stumble on the place.</P>
<P>They vse also to take Sammons and Trowts, by gro|ping, tickling them vnder the bellies, in the Pooles where they houer, vntill they lay hold on them with their hands, &amp; so throw them on land. Touching these, one scribling of the ryuer <HI>Lyner,</HI> rymed as ensueth:</P>

<P>In the Hauens, great store, and diuers sorts of fish, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hauen fish.</NOTE> some at one time of the yeere, and some at another, doe haunt the depthes and shallowes, while the lesser flie the greater, and they also are pursued by a bigger, each preying one vpon another, and all of them ad|customing, once in the yeere, to take their kind of the fresh water. They may bee diuided into three kinds, shell, star, and round fish. Of shell fish, there are Wrin|kles,
<PB N="30" REF="34">
Limpets, Cockles, Muscles, Shrimps, Crabs, Lob|sters, and Oysters.</P>
<P>Of flat fish, Rayes, Thorn-backes, Soles, Flowkes, Dabs, Playces.</P>
<P>Of round fish, Brit, Sprat, Barne, Smelts, Whiting, Scad, Chad, Sharkes, Cudles, Eeles, Conger, Basse, Miller, Whirlepole, and Porpose. The generall way of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Taking generall.</NOTE> killing these (that is the Fishermans bloudie terme, for this cold-blouded creature) is by Weares, Hakings, Saynes, Tuckes, and Tramels.</P>
<P>The Weare is a frith, reaching slope-wise through <NOTE PLACE="marg">Weare.</NOTE> the Ose, from the land to low water marke, and hauing in it, a bunt or cod with an eye-hooke, where the fish entring, vpon their comming backe with the ebbe, are stopped from issuing out againe, forsaken by the water, and left drie on the Ose.</P>
<P>For the Haking, certaine stakes are pitched in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Haking.</NOTE> Ose at low water, athwart some Creeke, from shore to shore, to whose feete they fasten a Net, and at ful|sea draw the vpper part thereof to their stops, that the fish may not retire with the ebbe, but be taken, as in the Weares.</P>
<P>The Sayne is a net, of about fortie fathome in length, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sayne.</NOTE> with which they encompasse a part of the Sea, and drawe the same on land by two ropes, fastned at his ends, together with such fish, as lighteth within his pre|cinct.</P>
<P>The Tucke carrieth a like fashion, saue that it is nar|rower <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tucke.</NOTE> meashed, and (therefore scarce lawfull) with a long bunt in the midst: the Tramel differeth not much from the shape of this bunt, and serueth to such vse as <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tramell.</NOTE> the Weare and Haking.</P>
<P><PB REF="35">
The particular taking of sundrie kinds of fishes, is al|most as diuers as themselues. Wrinckles, Limpete, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Particu|lar taking</NOTE> Cockles, and Muscles, are gathered by hand, vpon the rockes and sands. Many of the Crabs breede in the shels of Cockles, and of the Lobsters in those of Wrin|kles, as my selfe haue seene: being growne, they come forth, and liue in holes of Rockes, from whence, at low water, they are dragged out, by along crooke of yron.</P>
<P>The Shrimps are dipped vp in shallow water by the shore side, with little round nets, fastned to a staffe, not much vnlike that which is vsed for daring of Larkes.</P>
<P>The Oysters (besides gathering by hand, at a great ebbe) haue a peculiar dredge, which is a thicke strong <NOTE PLACE="marg">Oysters.</NOTE> net, fastned to three spils of yron, and drawne at the boates sterne, gathering whatsoeuer it meeteth, lying in the bottome of the water, out of which, when it is ta|ken vp, they cull the Oysters, and cast away the residue, which they terme gard, and serueth as a bed for the Oy|sters to breed in. It is held, that there are of them male, and female. The female, about May, and Iune, haue in them a certaine kind of milke, which they then shead, and whereof the Oyster is engendered. The little ones, at first, cleaue in great numbers, to their mothers shell, from whence, waxing bigger, they weane themselues, and towards Michaelmas, fall away. The Countrie people long retained a conceit, that in Summer time they weare out of kind (as in deed the milkie are) but some Gentlemen making experiment of the contrarie, began to eate them at all seasons, wherethrough, by spending them oftner and in greater quantitie, by spoyling the little ones, and by casting away the vnseasonable, there ensued a scarcitie, which scarcitie
<PB N="31" REF="35">
brought a dearth, the dearth bred a sparing, and the sparing restored a plenty againe. They haue a propertie, though taken out of the water, to open against the flood time, and to close vpon the ebbe, or before, if they bee touched, the which, not long sithence occasioned a ridiculous chaunce, while one of them through his so|daine shutting, caught in his owne defence, three yong Mice by the heades, that of malice prepensed, had con|spired to deuoure him, and so trebled the valour of the cleft block, which griped <HI>Milo</HI> by the hands.</P>
<P>Nature hath strowed the shore with such plenty of these Shel-fishes, as thereby shee warranteth the poore from dread of staruing: for euery day they may gather sufficient to preserue their life, though not to please their appetite, which, ordinarie with vs, was miraculous to the <HI>Rochellers</HI> in their siedge 1572.</P>
<P>After Shel-fish succeedeth the free-fish, so termed, because he wanteth this shelly bulwarke.</P>
<P>Amongst these, the Flowk, Sole and Playce followe the tyde vp into the fresh riuers, where, at lowe water the Countrie people finde them by treading, as they wade to seeke them, and so take them vp with their hands. They vse also to poche them with an instru|ment somewhat like the Sammon-speare.</P>
<P>Of Eeles there are two sorts: the one Valsen, of best taste, comming from the fresh riuers, when the great raine floods after September doe breake their beds, and carry them into the sea: the other, bred in the salt water, &amp; called a Conger Eele, which afterwards, as his bignes increaseth, ventreth out into the maine Ocean, &amp; is en|franchised a Burgesse of that vast co~mon-wealth: but in harbor they are take~ mostly by Spillers made of a cord,
<PB REF="36">
many fathoms in length, to which diuers lesser and shorter are tyed at a little distance, and to each of these a hooke is fastened with bayt: this Spiller they sincke in the sea where those Fishes haue their accustomed haunt, and the next morning take it vp againe with the beguiled fish.</P>
<P>For catching of Whiting and Basse, they vse a thred, so named, because it consisteth of a long smal lyne with a hooke at the end, which the Fisherman letteth slip out of his hand by the Boat side to the bottome of the wa|ter, and feeling the fish caught by the sturring of the lyne, draweth it vp againe with his purchase. The Por|poses are shaped very bigge and blacke. These chase the smaller schoels of fish from the mayne sea into the hauens, leaping vp and downe in the water, tayle after top, and one after another, puffing like a fat lubber out of breath, and following the fish with the flood, so long as any depth will serue to beare them; by which means they are sometimes intercepted: for the Borderers watching vntill they be past farre vp into some narrow creeke, get belowe them with their Boats, and cast a strong corded net athwart the streame, with which, and their lowd and continuall showting and noyse making, they fray and stop them from retyring, vntill the ebbe haue abandoned them to the hunters mercy, who make short worke with them, and (by an olde custome) share them amongst all the assistants with such indifferencie, as if a woman with child bee present, the babe in her wombe is gratified with a portion: a poynt also obser|ued by the Spearehunters in taking of Sammons.</P>
<P>Now from within harbour, we will launch out into <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fish on the coast.</NOTE> the deepe, and see what luck of fish God there shall send
<PB N="32" REF="36">
vs, which (so you talke not of Hares or such vncouth things, for that proues as ominous to the fisherma~, as the beginning a voyage on the day when Childermas day fell, doth to the Mariner) may succeed very profitable: for the coast is plentifully stored, both with those fore|remembred, enlarged to a bigger size, &amp; diuers other, as namely of shelfish, Sea-hedge-hogs, Scallops &amp; Sheath|fish. Of flat, Brets, Turbets, Dornes, Holybut. Round, Pilcherd, Herring, Pollock, Mackrell, Gurnard, Illeck, Tub, Breame, Oldwife, Hake, Dogfish, Lounp, Cun|ner, Rockling, Cod, Wrothe, Becket, Haddock, Guilt|head, Rough-hound, Squary Scad, Seale, Tunny, and many others, <HI>quosnunc, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Sheath, or Rasor-fish, resembleth in length and bignesse a mans finger, and in taste, the Lobster, but re|puted of greater restoratiue.</P>
<P>The Sea-hedge-hogge, of like or more goodnesse, is enclosed in a round shell, fashioned as a loafe of bread, handsomely wrought and pincked, and garded by an vt|ter skinne full of prickles, as the land Vrchin. But the least fish in bignes, greatest for gaine, and most in num|ber, is the Pilcherd: they come to take their kind of the fresh (as the rest) betweene haruest and Alhallon|tyde, and were wont to pursue the Brit, vpon which they feede, into the hauens, but are now forestalled on the coast by the Drouers and Sayners. The Drouers hang certaine square nets athwart the tyde, thorovv which the schoell of Pilchard passing, leaue many be|hind intangled in the meashes. When the nets are so filled, the Drouers take them vp, clense them, and let them fall againe.</P>
<P>The Sayners complayne vvith open mouth, that
<PB REF="37">
these drouers worke much preiudice to the Common|wealth of fishermen, and reape thereby small gaine to themselues: for (say they) the taking of some few, brea|keth and scattereth the whole schoels, and frayeth them from approaching the shore: neither are those thus ta|ken, marchantable, by reason of their brusing in the meash. Let the crafts-masters decide the controuersie.</P>
<P>The Sayne, is in fashion, like that within harbour, but of a farre larger proportion. To each of these, there <NOTE PLACE="marg">Saynes.</NOTE> commonly belong three or foure boates, carrying a|bout sixe men apeece: with which, when the season of the yeere and weather serueth, they lie houering vpon the coast, and are directed in their worke, by a Balker, or Huer, who standeth on the Cliffe side, and from thence, best discerneth the quantitie and course of the Pilcherd: according whereunto, hee cundeth (as they call it) the Master of each boare (who hath his eyestill fixed vpon him) by crying with a lowd voice, whist|ling through his fingers, and wheazing certing diuersi|fied and significant signes, with a bush, which hee hol|deth in his hand. At his appointment they cast out their Net, draw it to either hand, as the Schoell lyeth, or fareth, beate with their Oares to keepe in the Fish, and at last, either close and tucke it vp in the Sea, or draw the same on land, with more certaine profit, if the ground bee not rough of rockes. After one companie haue thus shot their Net, another beginneth behind them, and so a third, as oportunitie serueth. Being so taken, some, the Countrie people, who attend with their horses and paniers at the Cliffes side, in great num|bers, doe buy and carrie home, the larger remainder, is by the Marchant, greedily and speedily seized vpon.
<PB N="33" REF="37">
They are saued three maner of wayes: by fuming, pres|sing, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sauing.</NOTE> or pickelling. For euery of which, they are first salted and piled vp row by row in square heapes on the ground in some seller, which they terme, Bulking, where they so remaine for some ten daies, vntil the superfluous moysture of the bloud and salt be soked from them: which accomplished, they rip the bulk, and saue the re|sidue of the salt for another like seruice. Then those which are to bee ventred for <HI>Fraunce,</HI> they pack in staunch hogsheads, so to keepe them in their pickle. Those that serue for the hotter Countries of <HI>Spaine</HI> and <HI>Italie,</HI> they vsed at first to fume, by hanging them vp on long sticks one by one, in a house built for the nonce, &amp; there drying them with the smoake of a soft and conti|nuall fire, from whence they purchased the name of <HI>Fu|mados:</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fuma|dos.</NOTE> but now, though the terme still remaine, that trade is giuen ouer: and after they haue bene ripped out of the bulk, reffed vpon sticks, &amp; washed, they pack them orderly in hogsheads made purposely leake, which afterward they presse with great waights, to the end the traine may soke from them into a vessell placed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Trayne.</NOTE> in the ground to receyue it.</P>
<P>In packing, they keepe a iust tale of the number that euery hogshead contayneth, which otherwise may turne to the Marchants preiudice: for I haue heard, that when they are brought to the place of sale, the buyer openeth one hogs-head at aduentures; and if hee finde the same not to answere the number figured on the out|side, hee abateth a like proportion in euery other, as there wanted in that. The trayne is well solde, as im|ployed to diuers vses, and welneere acquiteth the cost in sauing, and the sauing setteth almost an infi|nite
<PB REF="38">
number of women and children on worke, to their great aduantage: for they are allowed a peny for euery lasts carriage (a last is ten thousand) and as much for bulking, washing, and packing them, whereby a lusty huswife may earne three shillings in a night; for to|wards the euening they are mostly killed.</P>
<P>This commoditie at first carried a very lowe price, and serued for the inhabitants cheapest prouision: but of late times, the deare sale beyond the seas hath so en|creased the number of takers, and the takers iarring and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Venting.</NOTE> brawling one with another, and for closing the fishes taking their kind within harbour, so decreased the num|ber of the take~, as the price daily extendeth to an higher rate, equalling the proportion of other fish: a matter which yet I reckon not preiudiciall to the Common|wealth, seeing there is store sufficient of other victuals, and that of these a twentieth part will serue the Coun|tries need, and the other nineteene passe into forraine Realmes with a gainefull vtterance.</P>
<P>The Sayners profit in this trade is vncertayne, as de|pending vpon the seas fortune, which hee long atten|deth, and often with a bootlesse trauaile: but the Pil|cherd Marchant may reape a speedy, large, and assured benefit, by dispatching the buying, sauing and selling to the transporters, within little more then three moneths space. Howbeit, diuers of them, snatching at wealth o|uer-hastily, take mony beforehand, and binde them|selues for the same, to deliuer Pilcherd ready saued to the transporter, at an vnder-rate, and so cut their fingers. This venting of Pilcherd enhaunced greatly the price of cask, whereon all other sorts of wood were conuer|ted to that vse: and yet this scantly supplying a remedie,
<PB N="34" REF="38">
there was a statute made 35. <HI>Eliz.</HI> that from the last of Iune 1594. no stranger should transport beyond the seas any Pilcherd or other fish in cask, vnlesse hee did bring <NOTE PLACE="marg">Caske.</NOTE> into the Realme, for euery sixe tunnes, two hundred of clapboord fit to make cask, and so rateably, vpon payne of forfeyting the sayd Pilcherd or fish. This A cte to continue before the next Parliament, which hath reui|ued the same, vntill his (yet not knowne) succeeder.</P>
<P>The Pilcherd are pursued and deuoured by a bigger kinde of fish, called a Plusher, being somewhat like the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Plusher.</NOTE> Dog-fish, who leapeth now and then aboue water, and therethrough bewrayeth them to the Balker: so are they likewise persecuted by the Tonny, and he (though not verie often) taken with them <HI>damage faisant.</HI> And that they may no lesse in fortune, then in fashion, resem|ble the Flying fish, certaine birds called Gannets, soare ouer, and stoup to prey vpon them. Lastly, they are per|secuted by the Hakes, who (not long sithence) haunted the coast in great abundance; but now being depriued of their wonted baite, are much diminished, verifying the prouerb, <HI>What we lose in Hake, we shall haue in Herring.</HI> These Hakes and diuers of the other forerecited, are ta|ken with threds, &amp; some of the~ with the boulter, which is a Spiller of a bigger size. Vpon the North coast, where want of good harbours denieth safe roade to the fisher|boats, they haue a deuice of two sticks filled with corks, and crossed flatlong, out of whose midst there riseth a thred, and at the same hangeth a saile; to this engine ter|med a Lestercock, they tie one end of their Boulter, lo as the wind comming fro~ the shore, filleth the sayle, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lester|cocks.</NOTE> the saile carrieth out the Boulter into the sea, which after the respite of some houres, is drawne in againe
<PB REF="39">
by a cord fastned at the neerer end. They lay also cer|taine Weelves in the Sea, for taking of Cunners, which therethrough are termed Cunner-pots. Another net they haue long and narrow meashed, thwarted with lit|tle cords of wide distance, in which the fish intangleth it selfe, and is so drawne vp.</P>
<P>For Bait they vse Barne, Pilcherd, and Lugges. The Lugge is a worme resembling the Tagworme or An|gletouch, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Baite.</NOTE> and lying in the Ose somewhat deepe, from whence the women digge them vp, and sell them to the Fishermen: They are descried by their working o|uer head, as the Tagworme. And, for lacke of other prouision, the Fishermen sometimes cut out a peece of the new taken Hake, neere his tayle, and therewith baite their hookes, to surprise more of his <HI>Canniballian</HI> fellowes.</P>
<P>The Seale, or Soyle, is in making and growth, not vn|like <NOTE PLACE="marg">Seales.</NOTE> a Pigge, vgly faced, and footed like a Moldwarp, he delighteth in musike, or any lowd noise, and thereby is trained to approach neere the shore, and to shew him|selfe almost wholly aboue water. They also come on land, and lie sleeping in holes of the Cliffe, but are now and then waked with the deadly greeting of a bullet in their sides.</P>
<P>The Fishermens hookes doe not alwayes returne them good prise: for often there cleaueth to the baite, a certaine fish like a Starre, so farre from good meate, as it <NOTE PLACE="marg">Star-fish.</NOTE> is held contagious.</P>
<P>There swimmeth also in the Sea, a round slymie sub|stance, called a Blobber, reputed noysome to the fish.</P>
<P>But you are tired, the day is spent, and it is high <NOTE PLACE="marg">Blobber.</NOTE> time that I draw to harbour: which good counsell I
<PB N="35" REF="39">
will follow, when I haue onely told you, in what ma|ner the Fishermen saue the most part of their fish. Some <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sauing.</NOTE> are polled (that is, beheaded) gutted, splitted, powdred and dried in the Sunne, as the lesser sort of Hakes. Some headed, gutted, iagged, and dried, as Rayes, and Thorn|backes. Some gutted, splitted, powdred, and dried, as Buckhorne made of Whitings, (in the East parts na|med Scalpions) and the smaller sort of Conger, and Hake. Some, gutted, splitted, and kept in pickle, as Whiting, Mackrell, Millet, Basse, Peall, Trowt, Sam|mon, and Conger. Some, gutted, and kept in pickle, as the lesser Whitings, Pollocks, Eeles, and squarie Scads. Some cut in peeces, and powdred, as Seale and Por|pose. And lastly, some boyled, and preserued fresh in Vineger, as Tonny and Turbet.</P>
<P>Besides these flooting burgesses of the Ocean, there <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sea foule</NOTE> are also certaine flying Citizens of the ayre, which pre|scribe for a corrodie therein; of who~ some serue for food to vs, and some but to feed themselues. Amongst the first sort, we reckon the Dip-chicke, (so named of his diuing, and littlenesse) Coots, Sanderlings, Sea-larkes, Oxen and Kine, Seapies, Puffins, Pewets, Meawes, Murres, Creysers, Curlewes, Teale, Wigeon, Burranets, Shags, Ducke and Mallard, Gull, Wild-goose, Heron, Crane, and Barnacle.</P>
<P>These content not the stomacke, all with a like sauo|rinesse, but some carrie a rancke taste, and require a for|mer mortification: and some are good to bee eaten while they are young, but nothing tooth-some, as they grow elder. The Guls, Pewets, and most of the residue, breed in little desert Ilands, bordering on both coastes, laying their Egges on the grasse, without making any
<PB REF="40">
nests, from whence the owner of the land causeth the young ones to be fetched about Whitsontide, for the first broode, and some weekes after for the second. Some one, but not euerie such Rocke, may yeeld yeere|ly towards thirtie dozen of Guls. They are kept tame, and fed fat, but none of the Sea kind will breede out of their naturall place: Yet at <HI>Caryhayes,</HI> master <HI>Treuanions</HI> house, which bordereth on the Cliffe, an old Gull did (with an extraordinarie charitie) accustome, for diuers yeeres together, to come and feede the young ones (though perhaps none of his allia~ce) in the court where they were kept. It is held, that the Barnacle breedeth vn|der water on such ships sides, as haue beene verie long at Sea, hanging there by the Bill, vntill his full growth dismisse him to be a perfect fowle: and for proofe here|of, many little things like birds, are ordinarily found in such places, but I cannot heare any man speake of ha|uing seene them ripe. The Puffyn hatcheth in holes of the Cliffe, whose young ones are thence ferretted out, being exceeding fat, kept salted, and reputed for fish, as comming neerest thereto in their taste. The Bur|ranet hath like breeding, and, after her young ones are hatched, shee leadeth them sometimes ouer-land, the space of a mile or better, into the hauen, where such as haue leasure to take their pastime, chace them one by one with a boate, and stones, to often diuing, vntill, through wearinesse, they are taken vp at the boates side by hand, carried home, and kept tame with the Ducks: the Egges of diuers of these Fowles are good to bee eaten.</P>
<P>Sea-fowle not catable, are Ganets, Ospray (Plynyes Haliaectos.)</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="40">
Amongst which, lacke-Daw (the second slaunder of our Countrie) shall passe for companie, as frequenting <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cornish Chough.</NOTE> their haunt, though not their diet: I meane not the com|mon Daw, but one peculiar to <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and there|through termed a <HI>Cornish Chough:</HI> his bil is sharpe, long, and red, his legs of the same colour, his feathers blacke, his conditions, when he is kept tame, vngratious, in fil|ching, and hiding of money, and such short ends, and somewhat dangerous in carrying stickes of fire.</P>
<P>After hauing marched ouer the land, and waded <NOTE PLACE="marg">Inhabi|tants.</NOTE> thorow the Sea, to discouer all the creatures therein insensible, &amp; sensible, the course of method summoneth me to discourse of the reasonable, to wit, the Inhabi|tants, and to plot downe whatsoeuer, noteworthily, belongeth to their estate, reall, and personall, and to their gouernment, spirituall, and temporall. Vnder their reall state, I comprise all that their industrie hath procured, either for priuate vse, or entercourse, and trasfike.</P>
<P>In priuate life, there commeth into consideration, their Tenements, which yeeld them sustinance, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Teneme~ts</NOTE> their houses, which afford them a place of abode. Eue|rie tenement is parcell of the demaynes, or seruices of some Mannor. Commonly thirtie Acres make a farthing land, nine farthings a <HI>Cornish</HI> Acre, and foure <HI>Cornish</HI> A|cres, a Knights fee. But this rule is ouerruled to a greater or lesser quantitie, according to the fruitfulnesse, or bar|rennesse of the soyle. That part of the demaines, which appertaineth to the Lords dwelling house, they call his Barten, or Berton. The tenants to the rest hold the same either by sufferance, Wil, or custome, or by co~uention. The customary tenaut holdeth at Wil, either for yeeres,
<PB REF="41">
or for liues, or to them and their heires, in diuers man|ners according to the custome of the Mannour. Custo|marie <NOTE PLACE="marg">Customa|rie.</NOTE> Tenants for life, take for one, two, three, or more liues, in possession, or reuersion, as their custome will beare. Somewhere the wiues hold by widdowes estate, and in many places, when the estate is determi|ned by the Tenants death, and either to descend to the next in reuersion, or to returne to the Lord, yet will his Executor, or Administrator detaine the land, by the custome, vntill the next Michaelmas after, which is not altogether destitute of a reasonable pretence.</P>
<P>Amongst other of this customarie Land, there are seuenteene Mannours, appertaining to the Duchie of <NOTE PLACE="marg">Duchie tenure.</NOTE> <HI>Cornwall,</HI> who doe euerie leuenth yere, take their Hold|ings (so they terme the~) of certain Comissioners sent for the purpose, &amp; haue continued this vse, for the best part of three hundred yeeres, through which, they reckon a kind of inheritable estate accrued vnto them. But, this long prescription notwithstanding, a more busie then well occupied person, not long sithence, by getting a Checquer lease of one or two such tenements, called the whole right in question, and albeit God denyed his bad minde any good successe: yet another taking vp this broken title, to salue himselfe of a desperate debt, prosecuted the same so far forth, as he brought it to the iutty of a <HI>Nisiprius.</HI> Hereon certayne Gentlemen were chosen and requested by the Tenants, to become sui|ters for stopping this gap, before it had made an irreme|diable breach. They repayred to <HI>London</HI> accordingly, and preferred a petition to the then L. Treasurer <HI>Bur|leigh.</HI> His L. called vnto him the Chauncellour, and Coife Barons of the Exchequer, and tooke a priuate
<PB N="37" REF="41">
hearing of the cause. It was there manifestly prooued before them, that besides this long continuance, and the importance, (as that which touched the vndooing of more then a thousand persons) her Highnesse pos|sessed no other lands, that yeelded her so large a benefit in Rents, Fines, Heriots, and other perquisites. These reasons found fauourable allowance, but could obtaine no thorough discharge, vntill the Gentlemen became suppliants to her Maiesties owne person, who, with her natiue &amp; supernaturall bounty, vouchsafed vs gra|tious audience, testified her great dislike of the attemp|ter, &amp; gaue expresse order for stay of the attempt: since which time, this barking Dogge hath bene musled. May it please God to award him an vtter choaking, that he neuer haue power to bite againe.</P>
<P>Herein we were beholden to <HI>Sir Walter Raleghs</HI> ear|nest writing, (who was then in the Countrey) to <HI>Sir Henry Killigrews</HI> sound aduice, and to Master <HI>William Killigrews</HI> painefull soliciting (being the most kinde pa|trone of all his Countrey and Countreymens affaires at Court.)</P>
<P>In times past, and that not long agoe, Holdings were so plentifull, and Holders so scarce, as well was the Land-lord who could get one to bee his Tenant, and they vsed to take assurance for the rent by 2. pledges of the same Mannour. But now the case is altred: for a farme, or (as wee call it) a bargaine can no sooner fall in hand, then the Suruey Court shalbe waited on with many Officers, vying &amp; reuying each on other; nay thei are taken mostly at a ground-hop, before they fall, for feare of comming too late. And ouer and aboue the old yerely rent, they will giue a hundred or two hundred
<PB REF="42">
yeeres purchace and vpward at that rate, for a fine, to haue an estate of three liues; which summe common|ly amounteth to ten, or twelue yeeres iust value of the land. As for the old rent, it carrieth at the most, the pro|portio~ but of a tenth part, to that whereat the tenement may be presently improued, &amp; somewhere much lesse: so as the Parson of the parish can in most places, dispend as much by his tithe, as the Lord of the Mannour by his rent. Yet is not this deare setting eueriewhere alike: for the westerne halfe of <HI>Cornewall,</HI> commeth far short of the Easterne, and the land about Townes, exceedeth that lying farther in the Countrey.</P>
<P>The reason of this enhaunsed price, may proue (as I gesse) partly, for that the late great trade into both the <HI>Indies,</HI> hath replenished these parts of the world, with a larger store of the Coyne-currant mettals, the~ our ancel|tours enioyed: partly, because the banishment of sin|gle-liuing <HI>Votaries,</HI> yonger mariages then of olde, and our long freedome from any sore wasting warre, or plague, hath made our Countrey very populous: and partly, in that this populousnes hath inforced an indus|trie in them, and our blessed quietnes giuen scope, and meanes to this industrie. But howsoeuer I ayme right or wide at this, once certayne it is, that for these husban|dry matters, the <HI>Cornish</HI> Inhabitants are in sundry points swayed by a diuerse opinion, from those of some other Shires. One, that they will rather take bargaines, at these excessiue fines, then a tolerable improued rent, being in no sort willing to ouer a penny: for they rec|kon that, but once smarting, and this, a continuall a|king. Besides, though the price seeme very high, yet mostly, foure yeeres tillage, with the husbandmans
<PB N="38" REF="42">
payne and charge, goeth neere to defray it. Another, that they fal euery where from Commons to Inclosure, and partake not of some Easterne Tenants enuious dis|positions, who will sooner preiudice their owne pre|sent thrift, by continuing this mingle-mangle, then ad|uance the Lords expectant benefit, after their terme expired.</P>
<P>The third, that they alwayes preferre liues before yeeres, as both presuming vpon the Countries health|fulnesse, and also accounting their family best proui|ded for, when the husband, wife, and childe, are sure of a liuing. Neither may I (without wrong) conceyle the iust commendation of most such wiues, in this be|halfe: namely, when a bargaine is so taken to these three, it often falleth out, that afterwards the sonne ma|rieth, and deliuereth his yeruing-goods (as they terme it) to his father, who in lieu thereof, by his wiues assent (which in many auncient deeds was formall) depar|teth to him and his daughter in lawe, with the one halfe of his Holding in hand.</P>
<P>Now, though after the fathers decease, the mother may, during her life, turne them both out of doores, as not bound by her owne word, and much lesse by her husbands: yet I haue seldome or neuer knowne the same put in practise, but true and iust meaning hath e|uer taken place.</P>
<P>Yet another vnconscionable quirk some haue of late time pried into, <HI>viz.</HI> in a ioynt-lease to three intended by the taker and payer, to descend successiuely and in|tirely, one of them passeth ouer his interest to a stranger, who by rigour of law shall hold it during the liues of the other twaine.</P>
<P><PB REF="43">
The ordinary couenants of most conuentionary. Te|nants are, to pay due Capons, doe haruest iournyes, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Conuen|tionary Tenants.</NOTE> grinde at the Mill, sue to the Court, discharge the office of Reeue and Tithing-man, dwell vpon the Tenement, and to set out no part thereof to tillage, without the Lords licence first obtained. Which conditions are yet enlarged or restrained, according to the Demifors hu|mour.</P>
<P>Vsuall it is for all sorts of Tenants, vpon death, at least, if not surrender, or forfeyture, to pay their best beast for a <HI>Heriot:</HI> yea, if a stranger, passing thorow the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Heriots.</NOTE> Countrey, chaunce to leaue his carkase behind him, he also must redeeme his buriall, by rendring his best beast which he hath with him, to the Lord of the soyle: or if he haue none, his best Iewell; or rather then fayle, his best garment then about him, in lieu thereof. But this custome hath beene somewhat shaken, in comming to triall, and laboureth of a dangerous Feuer, though the <HI>Cornish</HI> Gentlemen vse all possible remedies of almost <HI>fas et nefas,</HI> by pleading the 11. poynts of the Lawe, to keepe it on liue.</P>
<P>The free Tenants seruices, are ordinary with those of other places, saue that they pay in most places onely <HI>fee-Morton</HI> releefes, which is after fiue markes the whole Knights fee, (so called of <HI>Iohn</HI> Earle first of <HI>Morton,</HI> then of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and lastly King of this Land) whereas that of <HI>fee-Gloucester</HI> is fiue pound. And to accomplish this part, I haue heere inserted a note of the <HI>Cornish</HI> Knights fees and acres, which I receyued from my lear|ned and religious kinseman Master <HI>Robert Moyle.</HI></P>

NOw to weaue on our former web. The ancient ma<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="blotted" EXTENT="3 letters"> of <HI>Cornish</HI> building, was to plant their houses <NOTE PLACE="marg">Buildings</NOTE> lowe, to lay the stones with morter of lyme and sand, to make the walles thick, their windowes arched and little, and their lights inwards to the court, to set hearths in the midst of the roome, for chimneyes, which vented the smoake at a louer in the toppe, to couer their plan|chings with earth, to frame the roomes not to exceede two stories, and the roofes to rise in length aboue pro|portion, and to bee packed thick with timber, seeking therethrough onely strength and warmenesse; whereas now-adayes, they seat their dwellings high, build their walles thinne, lay them with earthen morter, raise them to three or foure stoaries, mould their lights large, and outward, and their roofes square and slight, coueting chiefly prospect and pleasure. As for Glasse and Plaister for priuate mens houses, they are of late yeeres in|troduction:</P>
<P>The poore Cotager contenteth himselfe with Cob for his wals, and Thatch for his couering: as for Brick and Lath walles, they can hardly brooke the <HI>Cornish</HI> weather: and the vse thereof being put in triall by some, was found so vnprofitable, as it is not continued by any.</P>

<P>And because traffike cannot bee exercised without <NOTE PLACE="marg">Waights and mea|sures.</NOTE> waights and measures, a word or two of them.</P>
<P>Touching wayghts, the statute 12. H. 7. which made a generall ordinance therein, did specially exempt those appertayning to the cunnage, in <HI>Deuon</HI> and <HI>Corn|wall, viz.</HI> that they should be priuiledged to continue their former vsage.</P>
<P>In measures the Shire varieth, not only from others, but also in it selfe: for they haue a land measure, and a water-measure: the water-measure, of things sold at the ships side (as salt aud peason) by the Inhabitants, is sixteene gallons the bushell; by strangers, betweene 18. and 24. The land-measure differeth in diuers places, from 18. to 24. gallons the bushell, being least in the East parts, and increasing to the Westwards, where they measure Oates by the hogshead.</P>
<P>The Iustices of peace haue oftentimes indeuoured to reduce this variance to a certaintie of double Win|chester: but though they raysed the lower, they cannot abate the higher to this proportion: and yet from the want of this reformation, there ensue many incon|ueniences: for the Farmer that hath the greatest bu|shell at the market, maketh a price for the lesser to follow with little, (or at least) no rateable deduction. Besides, they sell at home to their neighbours, the
<PB REF="59">
rest of the weeke, by the smaller measure, as was payd in the market for the bigger.</P>
<P>There are also some Ingrossers, who buy Wheat of the husbandman, after 18, gallons the bushell, and de|liuer it to the transporting Marchant, for the same summe, at 16.</P>
<P>So doth their Pearch exceed that of other Coun|tries, which amounteth vnto 18. foote. And it is like|wise obserued by strangers, that the <HI>Cornish</HI> miles are much longer then those about <HI>London,</HI> if at least the wearinesse of their bodies (after so painefull a iourney) blemish not the coniecture of their mindes. I can im|pute this generall enlargement of saleable things, to no cause sooner, then the <HI>Cornish</HI> mans want of vent and money, who therethrough, to equall others in quality of price, is driuen to exceed them in quantitie of mea|sure.</P>
<P>Touching the personall estate of the <HI>Cornish</HI> Inhabi|tants, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Personal estate. Names.</NOTE> to begin with their name in generall, I learne by master <HI>Camden</HI> (who, as the Arch-antiquarie <HI>Iustus Lip|sius</HI> testifieth of him, <HI>Britanniae nebulas claro ingenij sole il|lustrauit)</HI> that <HI>Ptolomey</HI> calleth them <HI>Damnonii,</HI> Strabo, <HI>Ostidamnii,</HI> and Aretemidorus, <HI>Cossini.</HI></P>
<P>Touching their particular denominations; where the <HI>Saxons</HI> haue not intruded their newer vsances, they partake in some sort with their kinsmen the <HI>Welsh:</HI> for as the <HI>Welshmen</HI> catalogize <HI>ap Rice, ap Griffin, ap Owen, ap Tuder, ap Lewellin, &amp;c.</HI> vntill they end in the highest of the stock, whom their memorie can reach vnto: So the Westerne <HI>Cornish,</HI> by a like, but more co~pendious maner, intitle one another with his owne &amp; his fathers christen name, and conclude with the place of his dwelling; as
<PB N="55" REF="59">
<HI>Iohn,</HI> the sonne of <HI>Thomas,</HI> dwelling at <HI>Pendaruis,</HI> is called <HI>Iohn Thomas Pendaruis. Rich.</HI> his yonger brother is named, <HI>Richard Thomas Pendaruis, &amp;c.</HI> Through which meanes, diuers Gent. and others haue changed their names, by remoouing their dwellings, as <HI>Trengoue</HI> to <HI>Nance, Bomthon,</HI> to <HI>Carclew,</HI> two brethren of the <HI>Thomas|ses,</HI> the one to <HI>Carnsew,</HI> the other to <HI>Rescrowe,</HI> and many other.</P>
<P>Most of them begin with <HI>Tre, Pol, or Pen,</HI> which signifie a Towne, a Top, and a head: whence grew the common by-word.</P>
<L>By <HI>Tre, Pol,</HI> and <HI>Pen,</HI></L>
<L>You shall know the <HI>Cornishmen.</HI></L>
<P>Neither doe they want some signification, as <HI>Godol|fin, alias Godolghan,</HI> a white Eagle: <HI>Chiwarton,</HI> the greene Castle on the hill: which Gentlemen giue such Armes; <HI>Reskimer,</HI> the great Dogges race, who beareth a Wolfe <HI>passant. Carnsew,</HI> alias, <HI>Carndew,</HI> a black rock: his house <HI>Bokelly,</HI> which soundeth the lost Goat: and a Goate he beareth for his coate: <HI>Carnimow,</HI> a little Citie: <HI>Cosowarth,</HI> the high Groue, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And as the <HI>Cornish</HI> names hold an affinity with the <HI>Welsh,</HI> so is their language deduced fro~ the same source, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Language</NOTE> and differeth onely in the dialect. But the <HI>Cornish</HI> is more easie to bee pronounced, and not so vnpleasing in sound, with throat letters, as the <HI>Welsh.</HI></P>
<P>A friend of mine, one master <HI>Thomas Williams,</HI> dis|coursed once with mee, that the <HI>Cornish</HI> tongue was deriued from, or at least had some acquayntance with the Greeke: and besides diuers reasons which hee pro|duced to proue the same, hee vouched many wordes of one sence in both; as for example:</P>

But the principall loue and knowledge of this lan|guage, liued in <HI>Doctor Kennall</HI> the Ciuilian, and with him lyeth buryed: for the English speach doth still en|croche vpon it, and hath driuen the same into the vtter|most skirts of the shire. Most of the Inhabitants can no word of <HI>Cornish;</HI> but very few are ignorant of the Eng|lish: and yet some so affect their owne, as to a stranger they will not speake it: for if meeting them by chance, you inquire the way or any such matter, your answere shalbe, <HI>Meea nauidua cowzasawzneck,</HI> I can speake no Sax|onage. The English which they speake, is good and pure, as receyuing it from the best hands of their owne Gentry, and the Easterne Marchants: but they disgrace it, in part, with a broad and rude accent, and eclipsing (somewhat like the Somersetshire men) speci|ally in pronouncing the names: as Thomas they call, <HI>Tummas &amp; Tubby:</HI> Mathew, <HI>Mathaw:</HI> Nicholas, <HI>Nichlaaz:</HI> Reignald, <HI>Reinol:</HI> Dauid, <HI>Daaui:</HI> Mary, <HI>Maari:</HI> Frauncis,

Others incline againe to the negatiue, alleadging the reasons heretofore touched, in the deare price of farmes or bargaines, by which mine assent is rather swayed: for I suppose that those waste grounds were inhabited and manured, when the Saxons and Danes continual inuasions draue them to abandon the sea coasts, saue in such townes, as were able to muster, vpon any sodaine occasion, a suffi|cient number for their owne defence. The residue re|tired into the heart of the land, where, vpon a longer warning, they might sooner assemble from all sides, to make head, and the enemie in so far a march and retrait, should aduenture a greater hazard to bee distressed by the way.

And thus much of <HI>Cornwall</HI> compa|red with it selfe: now, if you match it with other cham|pion Shires, methinks, I may gather the same to be bet|ter inhabited, within a like circuit of miles, because the plenty of hils &amp; valleys, afford a larger quantity of grou~d therunto.

like of small reading, to serue the peoples turne, and so curtall the better studied Counsellours profiting; once certayne it is, that few men of Law, haue either in our time, or in that of our forefathers, growne heere to any supereminent height of learning, liuely-hood or autho|ritie.</P>
<P>Of like fortune, but lesse number, are the Phisicio~s; by how much the fewer, by so much the greater witnesses <NOTE PLACE="marg">Phisicions.</NOTE> of the soyles healthfulnes. The most professours of that science in this County, sauing only one 10. <HI>Williams,</HI> can better vouch practise for their warrant, then warrant for their practise. Amongst these, I reckon <HI>Rawe Clyes</HI> a black Smith by his occupation, and furnished with no more learning, then is suteable to such a calling, who yet hath ministred Phisike for many yeres, with so often successe &amp; general applause, that not onely the home-bred mul|titude beleeneth mightily in him, but eue~ persons of the better calling, resort to him from remote parts of the realme, to make trial of his cu~ning, by the hazard of their liues; &amp; sundry, either vpon iust cause, or to cloke their folly, report that they haue reaped their errands end at his hands. But farre more commendable is M. <HI>Atwel,</HI> sometimes Parson of <HI>Caluerly</HI> in <HI>Deuon,</HI> &amp; now of S. <HI>Tue</HI> in <HI>Cornwall.</HI> For besides other parts of learning, with which he hath bene seasoned, he is not vnseene in the <HI>Theoricks</HI> of Phisike, &amp; can out of them readily and pro|bably discourse, touching the nature and accidents of all diseases. Besides, his iudgement in vrines commeth little behind the skilfullest in that profession. Mary his practise is somewhat strange &amp; varying from all others: for though now and then he vse blood-letting, and doe ordinarily minister <HI>Manus Christi,</HI> and such like cordials,
<PB REF="65">
of his owne compounding (a poynt fitting well with my humour, as enabling nature, who best knoweth how to worke) yet mostly for all diseases he prescribeth milk, and very often milk and apples, a course deepely subiect to the exception of the best esteemed Practitioners; and such notwithstanding, as whereby either the ver|tue of the medicine, or the fortune of the Phisicion, or the credulitie of the Patient, hath recouered sundry out of desperate and forlorne extremities.</P>
<P>This his reputation is of many yeeres standing, and maintayneth it selfe vnimpayred. But the same soareth to an higher pitch, by the helpe of another wing, and that is, his liberalitie. On the poore he bestoweth his paines &amp; charges <HI>gratis:</HI> of the rich he taketh moderate|ly, but leaues the one halfe behind, in gift amongst the houshold, if he be called abroad to visit any: The rest to|gether with the profits of his benefice (rather charitably accepted, the~ strictly exacted from his Parishioners) he powreth out with both hands <HI>in pios vsus,</HI> and will hardly suffer a penny to sleepe, but neuer to dwell with him.</P>
<P>Few Townes there are in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> or any other shire between that and <HI>London,</HI> which haue not in some large measure tasted of his bountie. None commeth in kind|nes to see him, but departeth gratifyed with somewhat, if his modestie will accept it. Briefely, his sound affecti|on in religion, is so wayted on by honesty of life, and pleasantnesse of conuersation, that in <HI>Fabritius</HI> his vo|luntary pouertie, he is an equall partner of his honour, and possesseth a large interest in the loue of his neigh|bours.

<P><HI>Sir Henry Killigrew,</HI> after Ambassades and messages, and many other employments of peace and warre, in his Princes seruice, to the good of his Countrey, hath made choyce of a retyred estate, and reuerently regar|ded by all sorts, placeth his principall contentment in himselfe, which, to a life so well acted, can no way bee wanting.</P>
<P><HI>Master George Carew,</HI> in his younger yeeres gathered such fruit, as the Vniuersitie, the Innes of Court, and forrayne trauell could yeeld him: vpon his returne, he was first called to the Barre; then supplyed the place of Secretarie to the Lord Chauncellour <HI>Hatton;</HI> and after his decease, performed the like office to his two succes|sours; by speciall recommendation from her Maiestie, who also gaue him the Prothonotaryship of the Chauncery, and in <HI>anno,</HI> 1598. sent him Ambassadour

<P><HI>Cornwall,</HI> no doubt, hath affoorded a far larger pro|portion of well deseruing and employed members, to the good of their Prince and Countrey, albeit they fall not within the compasse of my knowledge, &amp; it is like|ly that the succeeding age wil much encrease the nu~ber, by meanes of her Highnes bounty, who to that end hath established seed-plots of free Schooles, with com|petent <NOTE PLACE="marg">Free schooles.</NOTE> pentions out of her owne cofers, for the teach|ers at <HI>Saltash, Launceston,</HI> and <HI>Perin,</HI> three market townes of the County.</P>

More assured I am, that <HI>Sir Iohn Arundell</HI> of <HI>Trerne,</HI> vpon a long fight at sea, took prisoner one <HI>Duncane Camel,</HI> a har|dy Scottish Pirate, and presented him to K.

So did <HI>Sir Ric. Greinuile</HI> the elder enterlace his home Magistracy, with martiall employments abroad: whereof the K. testifyed his good liking by his liberality. Which domestical example, en|couraged his sonne <HI>Roger</HI> the more hardily to hazard, &amp; the more willingly to resigne his life, in the vnfortu|nate <HI>Mary Rose.</HI> A disposition &amp; successe equally fatall to that house: for his sonne againe, the second <HI>Sir Ric.</HI> after his trauell and following the warres vnder the Empe|rour <HI>Maximilian,</HI> against the great Turke, for which his name is recorded by sundry forrain writers, and his vn|dertaking to people Virginia and Ireland, made so glo|rious a conclusion in her Maiesties ship the <HI>Reuenge</HI> (of which he had charge, as Captaine, &amp; of the whole fleet as Vice-admirall) that it seemed thereby, when he fou~d none other to compare withall in his life, he striued through a vertuous enuy to exceed it in his death. A vic|torious losse for the realme; and of which the <HI>Spaniard</HI> may say with <HI>Pirrhus,</HI> that many such conquests would beget his vtter ouerthrow. Lastly, his son <HI>Iohn</HI> took hold of euery martiall occasion that was ministred him, vn|till, in seruice against her Highnesse enemies, vnder the commaund of <HI>Sir Walter Ralegh,</HI> the Ocean became his bedde of honour.

<P>The most <HI>Cornish</HI> Gentlemen can better vaunt of their pedigree, then their liuelyhood: for that, they de|riue <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cornish Gentle|men.</NOTE> from great antiquitie, (and I make question, whe|ther any shire in England, of but equall quantitie, can
<PB N="64" REF="68">
muster a like number of faire coate-Armours) whereas this declineth to the meane. One cause there is of both proceeding from the want of those supplies, which seruice, law and marchandise, afford the more inward Inhabitants of the Realme, as I haue else where touched: yet this rule is not so generall, but that it admitteth his exceptions: for there are diuers, whose patrimonies ex|tend to a large proportion; &amp; for the residue, the cheap|nes of their prouisions, and their casualties of Tyn, and fines (which 2. later ordinarily treble the certaine reuen|nue of their rents) enable them with their few scores, to equall the expences of those Easterne dwellers, who reckon by the hundreds: besides, they finde meanes by a suruey, to defray any extraordinarie charge of build|ing, marriage, lawing, or such like. Yet I cannot denie, but that some, in gaping for dead mens shooes, find their improuident couetous humour punished with going barefoot.</P>
<P>This angle which so shutteth them in, hath wrought many interchangeable matches with eche others stock, and giuen beginning to the prouerbe, that all Cornish gentlemen are cousins; which endeth in an iniurious consequence, that the king hath there no cousins. They keepe liberall, but not costly builded or furnished hou|ses, giue kind entertainement to strangers, make euen at the yeeres end with the profits of their liuing, are re|uerenced and beloued of their neighbours, liue void of factions amongst themselues (at leastwise such as breake out into anie daungerous excesse) and de|light not in brauerie of apparrell: yet the women would be verie loth to come behinde the fashion, in
<PB REF="69">
newfanglednes of the maner, if not in costlynes of the matter, which perhaps might ouer-empty their husba~ds purses. They conuerse familiarly together, &amp; often visit one another. A Gentleman and his wife will ride to make mery with his next neighbour; and after a day or twayne, those two couples goe to a third: in which progresse they encrease like snowballs, till through their burdensome waight they breake againe.</P>

<P>I had also made a more paynful, then perfect collecti|on of most of the <HI>Cornish</HI> Gentlemens names &amp; Armes: But because the publishing thereof might perhaps goe accompanied with diuers wrongs, to my much reue|renced friends the Heralds, by thrusting my sickle into their haruest; to a great many my Countrymen, whom my want of information should be forced to passe ouer vnmentioned; and to the truth it selfe, where my report (relying vpon other mens credits) might through their errour intitle me the publisher (though not the author) of falshood: I rather thought fit altogether to omit it, and to note onely, that of diuers Gentlemen there haue bene in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> either their names are worne out, or their liuings transferred by the females, into other fami|lies: as likewise, sundry of those there now inhabiting, are lately denized <HI>Cornish,</HI> being generally drawne thi|ther (besides other more priuate respects) through, ey|ther the desire of change, which the disease of discon|tent affecteth, or the loue of quiet in so remote a cor|ner, or the supposall of commodities there arising, and accruing, or the warrantize from ouerlooking &amp; bea|ring, where little difference in quality tendeth to an e|quality

<P>From Gentility, we wil descend to ciuility, which is or should be in the townsmen. Those in <HI>Cornwall</HI> do no <NOTE PLACE="marg">Townes|men.</NOTE> more by nature, then others elsewhere by choyce, con|ceiue themselues an estranged society from the vpland dwellers, and cary, I will not say a malice, but an emula|tion against them, as if one member in a body could co~|tinue his wel-being without a be holdingnes to the rest. Their chiefest trade consisteth in vttering their petty marchandises, &amp; Artificers labours at the weekly mar|kets. Very few among the~ make vse of that oportunity, which the scite vpon the sea proffereth vnto many, for building of shipping, and traffiking in grosse: yet some of the Easterne townes piddle that way, &amp; some others giue themselues to fishing voyages, both which (when need requireth) furnish her Maiesties nauy with good store of very seruiceable Mariners.</P>
<P>There are (if they be not slaundered) that hunt after a more easie then commendable profit, with little ha|zard, and (I would I could not say) with lesse consci|ence. <HI>Anno</HI> 32. H. 8. an act of Parliament was made for repayring, amongst others, the Borough townes of <HI>Launceston, Liskerd, Lostwithiel, Bodmyn, Truro,</HI> and <HI>Hel|ston</HI> in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> but with what fruit to their good, I can|not relate.</P>
<P>Within late yeeres memorie, the sea-cost Townes begin to proclaime their bettering in wealth, by costly encrease of buildings; but those of the Inland, for the most part, vouch their ruined houses, and abandoned streets, as too true an euidence, that they are admitted no partners in this amendment. If I mistake not the cause, I may with charitie inough wish them still the

same fortune: for as is elsewhere touched, I conceyue their former large peopling, to haue bin an effect of the countries impouerishing, while the inuasion of forraine enemies draue the Sea-coast Inhabitants to seeke a more safe, then commodious aboade in those Inland parts.</P>
<P>Strangers occasioned to trauaile through the shire, were wont, no lesse sharply the~ truly, to inueigh against the bad drinke, course lodging, and slacke attendance which they found in those houses that went for Innes: neither did their horses better entertainme~t, proue them any welcomer ghests then their masters: but in stead of remedy, they receyued in answere, that neither such an outcorner was frequented with many way farers, nor by hanging out signes, or forestalling at the Townes end, like the Italians, did they inuite any; and to make great prouision vpon small hope of vtterance, were to in|curre a skorne-worthy losse, seeing <HI>Aspettare, &amp; non venire</HI> (saith the same Italian) is one of the <HI>tre cose da morire.</HI></P>
<P>Touching the Yeomanrie of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> I can say lit|tle, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Yeoman|ry.</NOTE> worth the obseruing, for any difference from that of other shires, and therefore I will step downe the next staire to husbandmen.</P>
<P>These in times not past the remembrance of some <NOTE PLACE="marg">Husband men.</NOTE> yetliuing, rubbed forth their estate in the poorest plight, their grounds lay all in common, or onely deuided by stitch-meale: little bread-corne their drinke, water, or at best, but whey: for the richest Farmour in a pa|rish brewed not aboue twyce a yeere, and then, God wotte what liquour: their meat, Whitfull, as they call it, namely, milke, sowre milke, cheese, curds,
<PB REF="71">
butter, and such like as came from the cow and ewe, who were tyed by the one legge at pasture: their appa|rell, course in matter, ill shapen in maner: their legges and feet naked and bare, to which sundrie old folke had so accustomed their youth, that they could hardly a|bide to weare any shooes; complayning how it kept them ouer hote. Their horses shod onlie before, and for all furniture a pad &amp; halter, on which the meaner coun|trie wenches of the westerne parts doe yet ride astride, as all other English folke vsed before R. the 2. wife brought in the side saddle fashion of straw.</P>
<P>Suteable hereunto was their dwelling, &amp; to that their implements of houshold: walles of earth, low thatched roofes, few partitions, no planchings or glasse windows, and scarcely any chimnies, other then a hole in the wall to let out the smoke: their bed, straw and a blanket: as for sheets, so much linnen cloth had not yet stepped o|uer the narrow channell, betweene them and <HI>Brittaine.</HI> To conclude, a mazer and a panne or two, comprised all their substance: but now most of these fashions are vni|uersally banished, and the <HI>Cornish</HI> husbandman confor|meth himselfe with a better supplied ciuilitie to the Ea|sterne patterne, which hath directed him a more thri|uing forme of husbandrie; and our halcion dayes of peace enabled him to applie the lesson: so as, his fine once ouercome, he can maintaine himselfe &amp; his familie in a co~petent decencie to their calling, and findeth mo|nie to bestow weekely at the markets, for his prouisi|ons of necessitie and pleasure: for his quarterlie rent serueth rather as a token of subiection to his Land-lord, then any grieuous exaction on his tenement.</P>
<P>One point of their former roughnesse, some of the
<PB N="67" REF="71">
Westerne people doe yet still retaine, &amp; therethrough in some measure, verifie that restimonie which <HI>Mathew Westm.</HI> giueth of them, together with the Welsh, their auncient countrimen: namely, how fostering a fresh memorie of their expulsion long agoe by the English, they second the same with a bitter repining at their fel|lowship: and this the worst sort expresse, in combining against, and working them all the shrewd turnes which with hope of impunitie they can deuise: howbeit, it shooteth not to a like extremitie in all places and per|sons, but rather by little and little, weareth out vnto a more milde and conuersable fashion. Amongst them|selues they agree well, and companie louingly toge|ther: to their gentlemen they carrie a verie dutifull re|gard, as enured in their obeysance from their ance|stors, and holding them as <HI>Roytelets,</HI> because they know no greater. Onelie it might be wished, that diuers a|mongst them had lesse spleene to attempt law-suits, for pettie supposed wrongs, or not so much subtiltie and stiffenesse to prosecute them: so should their purses be heauier, and their consciences lighter: a reporter must auerre no falshood, nor conceale any truth.</P>
<P>We must also spare a roome in this Suruey, to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Poore.</NOTE> poore, of whom few Shires can shew more, or owne fewer then <HI>Cornwall. Ireland</HI> prescribeth to be the nur|serie, which sendeth ouer yeerely, yea and dayly whole Ship-loades of these crooked slips, and the dishabited townes afford them rooting: so vpon the matter, the whole County maketh a contribution, to pay those Lords their rent. Manie good Statutes haue beene en|acted for redresse of these abuses, and vpon the first pub|lishing, heedfully and diligently put in practise: but af|ter
<PB REF="72">
the nine dayes wonder expired, the law is forgotten, the care abandoned, and those vermine swarme againe in euerie corner: yet those peeuish charitable cannot be ignorant, that herethrough, to the high offence of God and good order, they maintaine idlenes, drunken|nesse, theft, lecherie, blasphemie, Atheisine, and in a word, all impietie: for a worse kind of people then these vagabonds, the realme is not pestered withal: what they co~sume in a day, wil suffice to releeue an honest poore pa|rishioner for a week, of whose work you may also make some vse: their staruing is not to be feared, for they may be prouided for at home, if they list: no almes therefore should be cast away vpon them, to the robberie of the needy impotent; but money least of all: for in giuing him saluour, you do him wrong, by changing his voca|tion, while you metamorphize him from a begger to a buyer. Lacks he meat, drinke, or apparrell? (and nothing els he ought to be owner of) he must procure them of the worst by free gift, and not make choice, for a iust price, of the best. Well, though the rogue laugh you to scorne at night, the alewife hath reason the next day to pray for you.</P>
<P>Surely we finde by experience, that this so hainous an enormitie may be both easily and quickly reformed: for let the Constables execute vpon the rogues that last most benificiall Act of Parliament, with due seueritie for one weeke, and the terror thereof will free the pa|rish for a month: vse it a month, and you are acquited for the whole yere.

Concerning the other, I haue little to say, vnlesse I should eccho some of their complaints, that they are defrauded of their right. The much eating of fish, especially newly taken, and therein principally of the liuers, is reckoned a great breed of those contagious humours, which turne into <HI>Leprosie:</HI> but whence soeuer the cause proceedeth, day|ly euents minister often pittifull spectacles to the <HI>Cor|nish</HI> mens eyes, of people visited with this affliction; some being authours of their owne calamity by the fore|mentioned diet, and some others succeeding therein to an <HI>haereditarius morbus</HI> of their ancestors: whom we will leaue to the poorest comfort in miserie, a helplesse pittie.</P>
<P>But let me lead you from these impleasing matters, to refresh yourselues with taking view of the <HI>Cornish</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Recr ea|tions.</NOTE> mens recreations, which consist principally in feastes and pastimes.</P>
<P>Their feasts are co~monly haruest dinners, Church|ales, and the solemnizing of their parish Churches de|dication, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Feasts.</NOTE> which they terme their Saints feast.</P>
<P><PB REF="73">
The haruest dinners are held by euery wealthy <NOTE PLACE="marg">Haruest dinners.</NOTE> man, or as wee terme it, euery good liuer, betweene Michaelmas and Candlemas, whereto he inuiteth his next neighbours and kinred, and though it beare onely the name of a dinner, yet the ghests take their supper also with them, and consume a great part of the night after in Christmas rule: neither doth the good cheere wholly expire (though it somewhat decrease) but with the end of the weeke.</P>
<P>For the Church-ale, two young men of the parish <NOTE PLACE="marg">Church|ale.</NOTE> are yerely chosen by their last foregoers, to be Wardens, who deuiding the task, make collection among the pa|rishioners, of whatsoeuer prouision it pleaseth them vo|luntarily to bestow. This they imploy in brewing, ba|king, &amp; other acates, against Whitsontide; vpon which Holydayes, the neighbours meet at the Church house, and there merily feed on their owne victuals, contribu|ting some petty portion to the stock, which by many smalls, groweth to a meetly greatnes: for there is en|tertayned a kinde of emulation betweene these War|dens, who by his graciousnes in gathering, and good husbandry in expe~ding, can best aduance the Churches profit. Besides, the neighbour parishes, at those times louingly visit one another, and this way frankely spend their money together. The afternoones are consumed in such exercises, as olde and yong folke (hauing ley|sure) doe accustomably weare out the time withall.</P>
<P>When the feast is ended, the Wardens yeeld in their account to the Parishioners, and such money as excee|deth the disbursments, is layd vp in store, to defray any extraordinary charges arising in the parish, or imposed on them for the good of the Countrey, or the Princes
<PB N="69" REF="73">
seruice. Neither of which commonly gripe so much, but that somewhat stil remayneth to couer the purses bottome.</P>
<P>The Saints feast is kept vpon the dedication day, by <NOTE PLACE="marg">Saints feasts</NOTE> euery housholder of the parish, within his owne dores, each entertayning such forrayne acquaintance, as will not fayle when their like turne commeth about, to re|quite him with the like kindnes.</P>
<P>Oflate times, many Ministers haue by their ernest in|uectiues, both condemned these Saints feasts as super|stitious, and suppressed the Church-ales, as licencious: concerning which, let it breed none offence, for me to report a conference that I had not long since, with a neere friend, who (as I conceiue) looked heerinto with an Indifferent and vnpreiudicating eye. I do reuerence (sayd he) the calling and iudgement of the Ministers, especially when most of them concurre in one opinion, and that the matter controuersed, holdeth some affinity with their profession. Howbeit, I doubt, least in their exclayming or declayming against Church-ales and Saints feasts, their ringleaders did onely regard the rinde, and not perce into the pith, and that the rest were chiefly swayed by their example: euen as the vulgar, rather stouped to the wayght of their authoritie, then became perswaded by the force of their reasons. And first touching Church-ales, these be mine assertions, if not my proofes: Of things induced by our forefa|thers, some were instituted to a good vse, and peruer|ted to a bad: againe, some were both naught in the in|uention, and so continued in the practise. Now that Church-ales ought to bee sorted in the better ranke of these twaine, may be gathered from their causes and ef|fects,
<PB REF="74">
which I thus r&aacute;ffe vp together: entertaining of Christian loue, conforming of mens behauiour to a ci|uill conuersation, compounding of controuersies, ap|peasing of quarrels, raising a store, which might be con|uerted, partly to good and godly vses, as releeuing all sorts of poore people, repairing of Churches, building of bridges, amending of high wayes; and partly, for the Princes seruice, by defraying at an instant, such rates and taxes as the magistrate imposeth for the Countries defence. Briefly, they tende to an instructing of the minde by amiable conference, and an enabling of the body by commendable exercises. But I fearing lest my friend would runne himselfe out of breath, in this volubilitie of praising, stept athwart him with these obiections: That hee must pardon my dissenting from his opinion, touching the goodnesse of the institution: for taken at best, it could not bee martialled with the sa|cred matters, but rather with the ciuill, if not with the profane; that the very title of ale was somewhat nasty, and the thing it selfe had beene corrupted with such a multitude of abuses, to wit, idlenes, drunkennesse, lasci|uiousnes, vaine disports of minstrelsie, dauncing, and disorderly night-watchings, that the best curing was to cut it cleane away. As for his fore-remembred good causes and effects, I sawe not, but that if the peoples mindes were guided by the true leuell of christian cha|rity &amp; duetie, such necessary and profitable contributi|ons might stil be continued <HI>gratis,</HI> &amp; the cou~try eased of that charge to their purse and conscience, which ensu|eth this gourma~dise. His reply was, that if this ordina~ce could not reach vnto that sanctity which dependeth on the first table, yet it succeeded the same in the next
<PB N="70" REF="74">
degree, as appertayning to the second. Mine exception against the title, he mockingly matched with their scru|pulous precisenes, who (forsooth) would not say Christ|mas, nor Michaelmas, as other folk did; but Christs tide, and Michaels tide: who (quoth he) by like consequence must also bind themselues to say, Toms tide, Lams tide, and Candles tide. But if the name of ale relish so ill, whereas the licour it selfe is the English mans ancientest and wholesomest drinke, and serueth many for meate and cloth too; he was contented I should call it Church beere, or Church wine, or what else I listed: mary, for his part hee would <HI>loqui cum vulgo,</HI> though hee studied <HI>sentire cum sapientibus.</HI> Where I affirmed, that the peo|ple might by other meanes be trayned with an equall largesse to semblable workes of charitie, hee suspected lest I did not enter into a through consideratio~ of their nature and qualitie, which he had obserued to be this: that they would sooner depart with 12. pennyworth of ware, then sixepence in coyne, and this shilling they would willingly double, so they might share but some pittance thereof againe. Now in such indifferent mat|ters, to serue their humors, for working them to a good purpose, could breed no maner of scandall. As for the argument of abuse, which I so largely dilated, that should rather conclude a reformation of the fault, then an abrogation of the fact.</P>
<P>For to prosecute your owne Metaphore (quoth hee) surely I holde him for a sory Surgeon, that cannot skill to salue a sore, but by taking away the lymme, and little better then the Phisicion, who, to helpe the disease, will reaue the life of his Pati|ent from him. Abuses, doubtlesse, great and many

haue, by successe of time, crept hereinto, as into what other almost, diuine, or ciuill, doe they not? and yet in these publike meetings, they are so presented to euery mans sight, as shame somewhat restrayneth the excesse, and they may much the sooner bee both espied and re|dressed. If you thinke I goe about to defend Church|ales, with all their faults, you wrong your iudgement, &amp; your iudgement wrongeth mee. I would rather (as a Burgesse of this ale-parliament) enact certaine lawes, by which such assemblies should be gouerned: namely, that the drinke should neither be too strong in taste, nor too often tasted: that the ghests should be enterlarded, after the Persian custome, by ages, yong and old, distin|guished by degrees of the better and meaner: and seue|red into sexes, the men from the women: that the meats should be sawced with pleasant, but honest talke: that their songs should be of their auncestours honourable actions: the principall time of the morning, I would haue hallowed to Gods seruice: the after-noones ap|plied to manlike actiuities: and yet I would not altoge|ther barre sober and open dauncing, vntill it were first throughly banished from mariages, Christmas reuels, and (our Countries patterne) the court: all which should be concluded, with a reasonable and seasonable portion of the night: and so (sayd hee) will I conclude this part of my speach, with adding onely one word more for my better iustification: that in defending feasts, I maintayne neither <HI>Paradox,</HI> nor a conceite in <HI>nu|bibus,</HI> but a matter practised amongst vs from our eldest auncestours, with profitable and well plea|sing fruit, and not onely by our nation, but, both in former ages, by the best and strictest disciplined com|mon

wealth of the Lacedemonians, who had their or|dinary <HI>Sissitia,</HI> and now in our dayes, as well by the re|formed, as Catholike Switzers, who place therein a principall <HI>Arcanum imperij.</HI></P>
<P>Now touching the Saints feasts, if you taynt them with suspect of superstition, because they are held vpon those Saints daies, by whose names the parish Churches are stiled, I will ward that blow with the shield of Arch-Saint <HI>Austines</HI> authoritie, who in his 8. booke of Gods Citie, and 27. Chap. in the like case, iustifieth a lesse al|lowable practise of the primitiue Christians. <HI>Summa,</HI> he closed his discourse with this protestation, that hee appealed not from, but to the honorably respected cen|sure of the reuerend Ministery, desiring his speach might receiue, not the allowance of a position, but the licence of a proposition: which my friends modest sub|mission, I could not but embrace my selfe, and recom|mend it ouer to your fauourable acceptation.</P>
<P>My last note touching these feasts, tendeth to a com|mendation of the ghests, who (though rude in their other fashions) may for their discreete iudgement in precedence, and preseance, read a lesson to our ciuilest gentry. Amongst them, at such publike meetings, not wealth but age is most regarded: so as (saue in a verie notorious disproportion of estates) the younger rich reckoneth it a shame sooner then a grace, to step or sit before the elder honest, and rather expecteth his turne for the best roome, by succession, then intrudeth thereto by anticipation.</P>
<P>Pastimes to delight the minde, the <HI>Cornish</HI> men haue Guary miracles, and three mens songs: and for exercise of the body, Hunting, Hawking, Shooting, Wrastling,
<PB REF="76">
Hurling, and such other games.</P>
<P>The Guary miracle, in English, a miracle-play, is a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Guary miracle.</NOTE> kinde of Enterlude, compiled in <HI>Cornish</HI> out of some scripture history, with that grossenes, which accompani|ed the Romanes <HI>vetus Comedia.</HI> For representing it, they raise an earthen Amphitheatre, in some open field, ha|uing the Diameter of his enclosed playne some 40. or 50. foot. The Country people flock from all sides, ma|ny miles off, to heare &amp; see it: for they haue therein, de|uils and deuices, to delight as well the eye as the eare: the players conne not their parts without booke, but are prompted by one called the Ordinary, who follow|eth at their back with the booke in his hand, and telleth them softly what they must pronounce aloud. Which maner once gaue occasion to a pleasant conceyted gen|tleman, of practising a mery pranke: for he vndertaking (perhaps of set purpose) an Actors roome, was accor|dingly lessoned (before-hand) by the Ordinary, that he must say after him. His turne came: quoth the Ordina|rie, Goe forth man and shew thy selfe. The gentleman steps out vpon the stage, and like a bad Clarke in scrip|ture matters, cleauing more to the letter then the sense, pronounced those words aloud. Oh (sayes the fellowe softly in his eare) you marre all the play. And with this his passion, the Actor makes the audience in like sort ac|quainted. Hereon the promptor falles to flat rayling &amp; cursing in the bitterest termes he could deuise: which the Gentleman with a set gesture and countenance still soberly related, vntill the Ordinary driuen at last into a madde rage, was faine to giue ouer all. Which trousse though it brake off the Enterlude, yet defrauded not the beholders, but dismissed them with a great deale

<P>They haue also <HI>Cornish</HI> three mens songs, cunningly <NOTE PLACE="marg">Three mens songs. Shooting.</NOTE> contriued for the ditty, and pleasantly for the note.</P>

<P>My deare friends, I come to complaine vpon you, but to your selues: to blame you, but for your good: to expostulate with you, but in the way of reconciliation. Alas, what my desert can iustify your abandoning my fellowship, &amp; hanging me thus vp, to be smoke-starued ouer your chimnies? I am no stranger vnto you, but by birth, your Countrywoman: by dwelling your neigh|bour: by education, your familiar: neither is my com|pany shamefull; for I haunt the light and open fieldes: nor my conuersation dangerous: nay, it shields you from dangers, and those not the least, but of grea|test consequence, the dangers of warre. And as in fight I giue you protection, so in peace I supplie you pastime; and both in warre and peace, to your lymmes I yeelde actiue plyantnesse, and to your bo|dyes healthfull exercise: yea I prouide you food when you are hungrie, and helpe digestion when you are full. Whence then proceedeth this vnkinde and vn|usuall strangenesse? Am I heauy for burthen? For|sooth, a fewe light stickes of wood. Am I combrous for carriage? I couch a part of my selfe close vnder your girdle, and the other part serueth for a walking-staffe in your hand. Am I vnhandsome in your sight?
<PB REF="77">
euery piece of mee is comely, and the whole keepeth an harmonicall proportion. Lastly, am I costly to bee prouided? or hard to bee maintayned? No, cheap|nesse is my purueyour, easinesse my preseruer, nei|ther doe I make you blow away your charges with my breath, or taynt your nose with my sent, nor defile your face and fingers with my colour, like that hell|borne murderer, whome you accept before me. I ap|peale then to your valiant Princes, <HI>Edwards,</HI> and <HI>Hen|ries,</HI> to the battayles of <HI>Cresey, Poyters, Agincourt,</HI> and <HI>Floddon,</HI> to the regions of Scotland, Fraunce, Spaine, Italy, Cyprus, yea and Iury, to be vmpires of this con|trouersie: all which (I doubt not) will with their eui|dence playnely prooue, that when mine aduerse party was yet scarcely borne, or lay in her swathling clouts, through mee onely your auncestours defended their Countrey, vanquished their enemies, succoured their friends, enlarged their Dominions, aduaunced their re|ligion, and made their names fearefull to the present age, and their fame euerlasting to those that ensue. Wherefore, my deare friends, seeing I haue so substan|tially euicted the right of my cause, conforme your wils to reason, conforme your reason by practise, and conuert your practise to the good of your selues and your Country. If I be praise-worthy, esteeme me: if ne|cessary, admit me: if profitable, employ me: so shall you reuoke my death to life, and shew your selues no degenerate issue of such honourable Progenitours. And thus much for Archery, whose tale if it bee disor|dered, you must beare withall, for shee is a woman, &amp; her minde is passionate.</P>

sufficiency that way: for long shooting, their shaft was a cloth yard, their pricks 24. score: for strength, they would pierce any ordinary armour: and one mas|ter <HI>Robert Arundell</HI> (whom I well knew) could shoot 12. score, with his right hand, with his left, and from be|hinde his head.</P>
<P>Lastly, for neere and well aimed shooting, Buts made them perfect in the one, and rouing in the other: for prickes, the first corrupter of Archery, through too much precisenesse, were then scarcely knowne, and lit|tle practised.

<P>Hurling taketh his denomination from throwing of the ball, and is of two sorts, in the East parts of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hurling.</NOTE> to goales, and in the West, to the countrey.</P>
<P>For hurling to goales, there are 15. 20. or 30. players more or lesse, chosen out on each side, who strip them|selues <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hurling to goales.</NOTE> into their slightest apparell, and then ioyne hands in ranke one against another. Out of these ranks, they match themselues by payres, one embracing another, &amp; so passe away: euery of which couple, are specially to watch one another during the play.</P>
<P>After this, they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue score off, other twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales. One of these is ap|poynted by lots, to the one side, and the other to his ad|uerse party. There is assigned for their gard, a couple of their best stopping Hurlers: the residue draw into the midst betweene both goales, where some indiffe|rent person throweth vp a ball, the which whosoeuer can catch, and cary through his aduersaries goale, hath wonne the game. But therein consisteth one of <HI>Her|cules</HI> his labours: for hee that is once possessed of the ball, hath his contrary mate waiting at inches, and as|saying to lay hold vpon him. The other thrusteth him in the brest, with his closed fist, to keepe him off; which they call Butting, and place in weldoing the same, no small poynt of manhood.</P>
<P>If hee escape the first, another taketh him in hand, and so a third, neyther is hee left, vntill hauing met (as the Frenchman sayes) <HI>Chausseura son pied,</HI> hee eyther touch the ground with some part of his bodie, in wrast|ling,
<PB N="74" REF="78">
or cry, Hold; which is the word of yeelding. Then must he cast the ball (named Dealing) to some one of his fellowes, who catching the same in his hand, ma|keth away withall as before; and if his hap or agility bee so good, as to shake off or outrunne his counter|wayters, at the goale, hee findeth one or two fresh men, readie to receiue and keepe him off. It is there|fore a very disaduantageable match, or extraordinary accident, that leeseth many goales: howbeit, that side carryeth away best reputation, which giueth most falles in the hurling, keepeth the ball longest, and presseth his contrary-neerest to their owne goale. Sometimes one chosen person on eche party dealeth the ball.</P>
<P>The Hurlers are bound to the obseruation of many lawes, as, that they must hurle man to man, and not two set vpon one man at once: that the Hurler against the ball, must not <HI>but,</HI> nor hand-fast vnder girdle: that hee who hath the ball, must <HI>but</HI> onely in the others brest: that he must deale no Fore-ball, <HI>viz.</HI> he may not throw it to any of his mates, standing neerer the goale, then him|selfe. Lastly, in dealing the ball, if any of the other part can catch it flying between, or e're the other haue it fast, he thereby winneth the same to his side, which straight|way of defendant beco~meth assailant, as the other, of as|sailant falls to be defendant. The least breach of these lawes, the Hurlers take for a iust cause of going together by the eares, but with their fists onely; neither doth any among them seek reue~ge for such wrongs or hurts, but at the like play againe. These hurling matches are most|ly vsed at weddings, where commonly the ghests vn|dertake to encounter all commers.</P>
<P><PB REF="79">
The hurling to the Countrey, is more diffuse and confuse, as bound to few of these orders: Some two or <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hurling to the countrie.</NOTE> more Gentlemen doe commonly make this match, ap|pointing that on such a holyday, they will bring to such an indifferent place, two, three, or more parishes of the East or South quarter, to hurle against so many other, of the West or North. Their goales are either those Gen|tlemens houses, or some townes or villages, three or foure miles asunder, of which either side maketh choice after the neernesse to their dwellings. When they meet, there is neyther comparing of numbers, nor matching of men; but a siluer ball is cast vp, and that company, which can catch, and cary it by force, or sleight, to their place assigned, gaineth the ball and victory. Whosoeuer getteth seizure of this ball, findeth himselfe generally pursued by the aduerse party; neither will they leaue, till (without all respects) he be layd flat on Gods deare earth: which fall once receiued, disableth him from any longer detayning the ball: hee therefore throweth the same (with like hazard of intercepting, as in the other hurling) to some one of his fellowes, fardest before him, who maketh away withall in like maner. Such as see where the ball is played, giue notice thereof to their mates, crying, Ware East, Ware West, &amp;c. as the same is carried.</P>
<P>The Hurlers take their next way ouer hilles, dales, hedges, ditches; yea, and thorow bushes, briers, mires, plashes and riuers whatsoeuer; so as you shall sometimes see 20. or 30. lie tugging together in the water, scra~bling and scratching for the ball. A play (verily) both rude &amp; rough, and yet such, as is not destitute of policies, in some sort resembling the feats of warre: for you shall
<PB N="75" REF="79">
haue companies layd out before, on the one side, to en|counter them that come with the ball, and of the other party to succor them, in maner of a fore-ward. Againe, other troups lye houering on the sides, like wings, to helpe or stop their escape: and where the ball it selfe goeth, it resembleth the ioyning of the two mayne bat|tels: the slowest footed who come lagge, supply the showe of a rere-ward: yea, there are horsemen placed also on either party (as it were in ambush) and ready to ride away with the ball, if they can catch it at aduan|tage. But they may not so steale the palme: for gallop any one of them neuer so fast, yet he shall be surely met at some hedge corner, crosse-lane, bridge, or deepe wa|ter, which (by casting the Countrie) they know he must needs touch at: and if his good fortune gard him not the better, hee is like to pay the price of his theft, with his owne and his horses ouerthrowe to the ground. Sometimes, the whole company runneth with the ball, seuen or eight miles out of the direct way, which they should keepe. Sometimes a foote-man getting it by stealth, the better to scape vnespied, will car|ry the same quite backwards, and so, at last, get to the goale by a windlace: which once knowne to be wonne, all that side flocke thither with great iolity: and if the same bee a Gentlemans house, they giue him the ball for a <HI>Trophee,</HI> and the drinking out of his Beere to boote.</P>
<P>The ball in this play may bee compared to an infer|nall spirit: for whosoeuer catcheth it, fareth straight|wayes like a madde man, strugling and fighting with those that goe about to holde him: and no sooner is the ball gone from, but hee resigneth this fury to the
<PB REF="80">
next receyuer, and himselfe becommeth peaceable as before. I cannot well resolue, whether I should more commend this game, for the manhood and exercise, or condemne it for the boysterousnes and harmes which it begetteth: for as on the one side it makes their bodies strong, hard, and nimble, and puts a courage into their hearts, to meete an enemie in the face: so on the other part, it is accompanied with many dangers, some of which doe euer fall to the players share. For proofe whereof, when the hurling is ended, you shall see them retyring home, as from a pitched battaile, with bloody pates, bones broken, and out of ioynt, and such bruses as serue to shorte~ their daies; yet al is good play, &amp; neuer Attourney nor Crowner troubled for the matter.</P>
<P>Wrastling is as full of manlinesse; more delightfull, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Wrastling.</NOTE> and lesse dangerous: which pastime, either the <HI>Cornish</HI> men deriued fro~ <HI>Corineus,</HI> their first pretended founder, or (at least) it ministred some stuffe to the farcing of that fable. But to let that passe, their co~tinual exercise in this play, hath bred the~ so skilfull an habit, as they presume, that neither the ancient Greek <HI>Palestritae,</HI> nor the Turks so much delighted <HI>Pelrianders,</HI> nor their, once country|men, and stil neighbours, the Bretons, can bereau them of this Laurell: and matchlesse, certes, should they be, if their cunning were answerable to their practise: for you shall hardly find an assembly of boyes, in <HI>Deuon</HI> or <HI>Cornwall,</HI> where the most vntowardly amongst them, will not as readily giue you a muster of this exercise, as you are prone to require it. For performing this play, the beholders cast themselues in a ring, which they call, Making a place: into the empty middle space whereof, the two champio~ wrastlers step forth, stripped into their
<PB N="76" REF="80">
dublets and hosen, and vntrussed, that they may so the better commaund the vse of their lymmes, and first sha|king hands in token of friendship, they fall presently to the effects of anger: for each striueth how to take hold of other, with his best aduantage, and to beare his ad|uerse party downe: wherein, whosoeuer ouerthroweth his mate in such sort, as that either his backe, or the one shoulder, and contrary heele do touch the ground, is ac|counted to giue the <HI>fall.</HI> If he be endangered, and make a narrow escape, it is called a <HI>foyle.</HI> This hath also his lawes, of taking hold onely aboue girdle, wearing a girdle to take hold by, playing three pulles, for tryall of the mastery, the fall-giuer to be exempted from playing againe with the taker, and bound to answere his suc|cessour, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Many sleights and tricks appertaine hereunto, in which, a skilfull weake man wil soone get the ouerhand of one that is strong and ignorant. Such are the Trip, fore-Trip, Inturne, the Faulx, forward and backward, the Mare, and diuers other like.</P>
<P>Amongst <HI>Cornish</HI> wrastlers, now liuing, my friend <HI>Iohn Goit</HI> may iustly challenge the first place, not by pre|rogatiue of his seruice in her Maiesties gard; but through hauing answered all challenges in that pastime without blemish. Neither is his commendation boun|ded within these limits, but his cleane made body and actiue strength, extend (with great agility) to whatsoe|uer other exercise, of the arme or legge: besides his abi|litie (vpon often tryall) to take charge at Sea, eyther as Master, or Captayne.

After|wards, about the time of our last conquest, the country was sorted by a more orderly maner into parishes, &amp; eue|ry parish co~mitted to a spirituall father, called their Par|son, who stept into that roome, not by election (as some imagine) but mostly, by the nomination of him that ey|ther built the Church, or endowed the same with some liuelyhood, or was L&punc; of the soyle where it stood. As for Vicarages, those daies knew few, for they grew vp in more corrupt ages, by the religious houses encrochme~ts. Besides this Incu~bent, euery parish had certaine officers, as Church wardens, Sidemen, and 8. men, whose duety bound them to see the buildings &amp; ornaments appertai|ning to Gods seruice, decently maintayned, &amp; good or|der there reuere~tly obserued. And lest negligence, igno|rance, or partiality, might admit or foist in abuses, &amp; cor|ruption, an Archdeacon was appointed to take account of their doings by an verely visitatio~, &amp; they there sworn duly to make it. He &amp; they againe had their Ordinary, the Bishop, euery 3. yere to ouerlook their actions, &amp; to examine, allow, &amp; admit the ministers, as they and the Bishop were se~blably subiect to the Metropolitanes sur|uey euery 7. yere. For warning the Clergy, &amp; impar|ting their superiours directions, the Curats chose yerely their Deanes rurall. The Bishop, in his cathedrall church was associated with certaine Prebe~daries, some resident, who serued as his ghostly cou~sel in points of his charge, &amp; others not bound to ordinary reside~ce, who were cal|led to co~sultation, vpon things of greater co~sequence: &amp; for matters of principal importa~ce, the Archbishop had his prouincial Sinod, &amp; the whole clergy their national.</P>

<P>The Maiors and Recorders, in some of these, are Ius|tices of the peace, for their owne limits, and welneere all of them haue large exemptions and iurisdictions. A garment (in diuers mens opinions) ouer-rich and wide, for many of their wearish and ill-disposed bodies. They alleadge for themselues, that speedy iustice is adminis|tred in their townes, and that it saueth great expences, incident to assize trials, which poore Artificers cannot vndergoe. But the other answere, that these trials are often poasted on, with more haste then good speed, while an ignorant fellow, of a sowter, becomes a magis|trate, &amp; takes vpon him peremptory iudgement, in debts and controuersies, great and doubtfull, Againe, the neer|nesse
<PB N="87" REF="91">
of commencing their suits, draweth on more ex|pences, then the shortnes of tryals cutteth off, whereas longer respit would make way to deliberation, and de|liberation open the doore to reason, which by the fumes arising from cholers boyling heat, is much obscured. Thus dooth the oportunity inure them to vexation; vexation begetteth charges, and charge hatcheth pouer|ty: which pouerty, accompanied with idlenes (for they cannot follow law, and worke) seeketh not to releeue it selfe by industry, but by subtilty, wherethrough they be|come altogether depraued in body, goods, and minde. Adde hereunto, that the Maior exercising his office but during one yeere, for the first halfe thereof is common|ly to learne what he ought to doe, &amp; in the other halfe, feeling his authoritie to wane, maketh friends of that Mammon, &amp; serueth others turnes, to be requited with the like, borrowing from iustice, what hee may lend to his purse, or complices: for as it hath bene well sayd, <HI>He cannot long be good, that knowes not why he is good.</HI> They conclude, how from these imperfect associations, there spring pride amongst themselues, disdayne at their neighbours, and Monopolies against the Common|wealth.</P>
<P>This inuectiue is somewhat deeply steeped in gall, &amp; must therefore bee interpred, not of all, but the worst. Surely, for mine owne part, I am of opinion, that how co~modious soeuer this iurisdiction may proue amongst themselues, it falleth out sundry times very distastefull and iniurious towards strangers; and strangers they rec|kon all that are not Burgesses. Now, let such a one bee arrested within their corporatio~s, no sureties but towns|men can finde acceptance, be his behauiour neuer so ho|nest,
<PB REF="92">
his cause neuer so iust, his calling neuer so regard|full, &amp; his ability neuer so sufficient; yet if he haue none acquaintance in the towne, if the action brought, carry a shew of waight, if the bringer be a man of sway, in, or neere the towne, if any other townsman of the high|er sort beare him an old grudge, he must be contented to fret the colde yrons with his legges, and his heart with griefe: for what one, amongst them, will procure an e|uerlasting enemy at his doore, by becomming surety for a party, in who~ he possesseth none, or little interest? The ancients vsed to grace their Cities with seuerall titles, as <HI>Numantia bellicosa, Thebae superbae, Corinthus ornata, Athenae doctae, Hierusalem sancta, Carthago emula, &amp;c.</HI> and the pre|sent Italians doe the like touching theirs, as <HI>Roma santa, Venetia ricca, Florenza bella, Napoli gentile, Ferrara ciuile, Bologna grassa, Rauenna antiqua, &amp;c.</HI> In an imitation whereof, some of the idle disposed <HI>Cornish</HI> men nicke their townes with by-words, as, The good fellowship of <HI>Padstowe,</HI> Pride of <HI>Truro,</HI> Gallants of <HI>Foy, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>Their ordinary vse was, to begin the quarter Sessi|ons for the East halfe of the Shire, on the Tuesdayes and VVednesdayes, at <HI>Bodmyn,</HI> and to adiourne
<PB REF="93">
the same for the West halfe, to be ended at <HI>Truro</HI> the Friday and Saterday following, leauing one dayes space for riding betweene. But about twenty yeres sithence, the Easterne Iustices making the greatest number, and in this separation hauing farthest to ride, when they were disposed to attend both places, either in regard of their ease, or vpon scruple of conscience, or for both to|gether, called into question, whether this custome were as warrantable by right, as it was pleadable by prescrip|tion; and whether it as much aduanced the administra|tion of iustice, as it eased the trauell of the people. And thereupon they began to appoynt the intire Sessions at either place one after another. This was sometimes per|formed, and sometimes broken, by the Westerne Iusti|ces, so as seuerall and contrary precepts of summons were directed to the Sheriffe, with the great vncertayn|ty, ill example, and trouble of the Countrey. It hapned, that one newly associated, and not yet seasoned with ei|ther humour, made this motion for a reconcilement, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Sessions should enterchangeably one quarter begin at <HI>Bodmyn,</HI> and end at <HI>Truro:</HI> and the next begin at <HI>Truro,</HI> and end at <HI>Bodmyn;</HI> and that no recog|nisance should be discharged, or cause decided out of his owne diuision. This proposition, as it gaue the Westerne Iustices the greatest part of their will, so it salued a sore which chiefely grieued the Easterne: for before, what was done in the beginning at one place; was, or might be vndoone in the ending at the other: wherefore all parties willingly condiscended hereunto, and it hath euer sithence beene accordingly obserued.</P>
<P>Another variance hath sometimes fallen out be|tweene <HI>Cornwall</HI> and <HI>Deuon,</HI> about the time of keeping
<PB N="89" REF="93">
their Sessions, For whereas the Statute 2. <HI>H.</HI> 5. enacteth, that the Iustices shall hold the same in the first weeke after <HI>S. Michael,</HI> the <HI>Epiphanie,</HI> the clause of <HI>Euster,</HI> and the translation of <HI>S. Thomas</HI> (which, worthily blotted out of the Calender, <HI>Teste Newbrigensi,</HI> is euer the se|uenth of Iuly) and their oath bindeth them to a strickt obseruation hereof: the question hath growne, when those festiuall dayes fall vpon a Munday, whether the Sessions shall be proclaimed for that weeke, or the next, and the generall practise hath gone with the former. But the <HI>Cornish</HI> Iustices, waying, that prescription is no Su|persedeas for swearing, vpon debating of the matter, haue resolued, and lately accustomed, in such cases, to put it ouer vnto the weeke ensuing: and these are their reasons: If the Sessions must bee kept in the first weeke after, it cannot admit an interpretation of the same week it selfe. Againe, the clause of <HI>Easter,</HI> mencioned in the one, should seeme to make a construction of like mea|ning in the rest. Besides, those, who suite themselues to the other fashion, doe yet swarue therefrom, if those feastes fall vpon any later day in the weeke then Mun|day; for then they deferre it till the next: and yet, seeing no day certaine is directed for beginning the Sessions; if they will constantly binde themselues to the former sense, when those dayes fall on the Friday, they ought to call it for the morrow following. The Iudges of the circuits Oracle, to which the Commission of the peace referreth the Iustices <HI>Quaeres,</HI> hath resolued, that neyther of these wayes tendeth to any breach of the lawe. Once sure it is, that the Terme-suiters may best speed their businesse, by supporting the former: for the end of these Sessions deliuereth them space inough
<PB REF="94">
to ouertake the beginning of the Termes.</P>
<P>For the rest, equity beareth more sway, then grauity, at the <HI>Cornish</HI> bench, and in confusion they mayntayne equality: for though they speake more then one at once, yet no one mans speach, or countenance, can carry a matter against the truth. Neither doe assertions, but proofes in hearings; nor vouchings, but shewing of law cases, in deciding, order the controuersies: and as di|uersitie in opinions breedeth no enmity, so ouer-ruling by most voyces, is taken for no disgrace.</P>
<P>One only Iudge was wont, in three dayes at farthest, to dispatch the Assizes, &amp; gayle deliuery, at <HI>Launceston,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Iudges.</NOTE> the vsuall (though not indifferentest) place, where they are holden. But malice and iniquity haue so encreased, through two contrary effects, wealth and pouerty, that now necessity exacteth the presence of both, and (not seldome) an extent of time.</P>
<P>I haue heard the Iudges note, that besides their ordi|nary paines, they are troubled with more extraordinary supplications in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> then in any other shire: where|to they yet giue no great encouragement, while the causes are on the backside, poasted ouer to Gentlemens hearing, and account seldome taken or made, what hath bene done therein.</P>
<P>Verily, we must acknowledge, that euer since our re|membrance, God hath blessed this Westerne circuit with speciall choyce of vpright and honest Iudges; a|mongst whom, this of our last is not the least: for they doe so temper a quick conceit with a stayed iudgement, a strict seuerity in punishing, with a milde mercy in re|mitting, and an awfull grauitie at the Bench, with a fa|miliar kindnesse in conuersation, as they make proofe,
<PB N="90" REF="94">
that contrarie vertues may, by the diuers wayes of loue and reuerence, meet in one onely poynt of ho|nour.</P>
<P>The common Gayle of the shire for offendours, is <NOTE PLACE="marg">Gayle.</NOTE> kept at <HI>Launceston:</HI> for that statute, 33. <HI>H.</HI> 8. which a|mongst other shires, gaue the <HI>Cornish</HI> Iustices leaue to alter the same, by a Prouiso, tooke it away againe, in that this keepership is annexed to the Constableship of the Castle, and that graunted out in lease.</P>
<P>I wil conclude with the highest iurisdiction, namely, the Parliament, to which <HI>Cornwall,</HI> through the grace of his Earles, sendeth an equall, if not larger number of Burgesses, to any other shire. The boroughs so priui|ledged, more of fauour (as the case now standeth with many of them) then merit, are these following: <HI>Laun|ceston, Downeuet, Liskerd, Lostwithiel, Truro, Bodmyn, Hel|ston, Saltash, Camelford, Eastloo, Westloo, Prury, Tregny, Kel|lington, Bossimy, S. Iues, S. Germanes, Meddishole,</HI> and <HI>S. Mawes:</HI> and because <HI>Quindec.</HI> are ordinarily graunted at Parliaments, together with the Subsidies, I will heere set downe the ordinary rate of them.</P>

<HEAD>THE SVRVEY OF CORNWALL.</HEAD>
<HEAD>The second Booke.</HEAD>
<P>_IN this second booke I will first report, what I haue learned of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and <HI>Cornishmen</HI> in general, and from thence descend to the particular places and persons, as their note-worthie site, or any memorable action, or accident, of the former or later ages, shall offer occasion.</P>
<P>The highest which my search can reach vnto, I bor|row <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cornish|men in generall.</NOTE> out of <HI>Strabo,</HI> who writeth, that the Westerne Bre|tons gaue ayde vnto the <HI>Armorici</HI> of Fraunce, against <HI>Caesar,</HI> which hee pretended for one of the causes, why he inuaded this Iland.</P>
<P>Next I find, that about sixtie yeeres from the landing of <HI>Hengist,</HI> one <HI>Nazaleod,</HI> a mightie King amongst the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Anno Do.</HI> 509.</NOTE> Bretons, ioyned battell with <HI>Certicus,</HI> Soueraigne of the West-Saxons, and after long fight, with his owne death accompanied the ouerthrow of his armie. Yet, the Bre|tons, thus abandoned by fortune, would not so forsake <NOTE PLACE="marg">519.</NOTE> themselues, but with renued courage, and forces, coped once againe with <HI>Certicus,</HI> and his sonne <HI>Kenrick,</HI> at
<PB REF="101">
<HI>Certicesford,</HI> thogh equally destitute of successe as before.</P>
<P><HI>Gurmund,</HI> an arch-Pirate of the <HI>Norwegians,</HI> was called <NOTE PLACE="marg">590.</NOTE> by the Saxons, out of his late conquered Ireland, to their aide, against <HI>Careticus</HI> king of the Bretons; whom he ouercame in battel, and inforced his subiects to seeke safegard by flight, some in <HI>Wales,</HI> some in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and some in little <HI>Breteigne:</HI> since which time, they could neuer recouer againe their auncient possession of the whole Iland.</P>
<P>Howbeit, not long after, <HI>Iuor,</HI> sonne to <HI>Alane,</HI> king of <NOTE PLACE="marg">688.</NOTE> the said little <HI>Breteigne,</HI> landed in the West parts, wanne from the Saxons, <HI>Cornwall, Deuon,</HI> &amp; <HI>Somerset</HI> shires, by force of armes, and then established his conquest, by a peaceable composition with his aduerse partie.</P>
<P><HI>Adelred,</HI> king of West-sex, inuaded <HI>Deuon</HI> and <HI>Corn|wall,</HI> whom <HI>Roderick,</HI> king of the Bretons, and <HI>Blederick</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">720.</NOTE> Prince of those prouinces, encountred and discomfited: which notwithstanding, processe of time reaued from <NOTE PLACE="marg">750.</NOTE> him, and added such strength to his enemies, that he was driuen to abandon <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and retire into <HI>Wales.</HI></P>
<P>So, the <HI>Cornishmen</HI> quitting their libertie with their <NOTE PLACE="marg">809.</NOTE> prince, stouped to the co~maund of <HI>Egbert</HI> King of West-sex, and with their territorie (saith <HI>William Malmsburie)</HI> enlarged his confines.</P>
<P><HI>Athelstane</HI> handled them yet more extremely; for hee draue them out of <HI>Excester,</HI> where, till then, they bare e|quall <NOTE PLACE="marg">937.</NOTE> sway with the Saxons, &amp; left onely the narrow an|gle on the West of <HI>Tamer</HI> riuer, for their Inhabitance, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Limits.</NOTE> which hath euer since beene their fatall bound.</P>
<P>On their <HI>Reguli</HI> (as <HI>Vincentius</HI> deliuereth) he imposed <NOTE PLACE="marg">Tribute.</NOTE> an yerely tribute, of 20. li. in gold, 300. li. in siluer, 25. oxen, and hunting hounds and hawkes, at discretion.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="101">
To these afflictions by home-neighbours of bondage, <NOTE PLACE="marg">997.</NOTE> tribute, and banishing, was ioyned a fourth, of spoyling by forrayne enemies: for <HI>Roger Houedon</HI> telleth vs, that the Danes landed in sundry places of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> forrayed the Countrey, burned the Townes, and killed the people.</P>
<P>To whom succeeded in the like occupation, <HI>Godwin,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1068.</NOTE> and <HI>Edmond magnus,</HI> King <HI>Harolds</HI> two sonnes, discom|fiting the forces opposed against them, harrowing <HI>De|uon</HI> and <HI>Cornwall,</HI> and then retiring with their prey into <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>After the conquest, when K. <HI>H.</HI> the first inuaded <NOTE PLACE="marg">1113.</NOTE> <HI>Griffin ap Conan</HI> Prince of Wales, he distributed his ar|mie into three portions, one of which (wherein consis|ted the forces of the fourth part of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Cornwal)</HI> hee committed to the leading of <HI>Gilbert</HI> Earle of Strigill.</P>
<P>In <HI>Henry</HI> the thirds time, by the testimony of <HI>Ma|thew</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1227.</NOTE> <HI>Paris, William</HI> Earle of Sarum, after long tossing at sea, with much adoe, about Christmas arriued in <HI>Cornwall:</HI> and so afterwards, did Earle <HI>Richard,</HI> the Kings brother, at two seuerall times: the later of which, being destitute of horses and treasure, he prayed therein ayde of his loyals.</P>
<P>When <HI>Edward</HI> the third auerred his right to the <NOTE PLACE="marg">1339.</NOTE> Crowne of Fraunce, by the euidence of armes, the French for a counterplea, made an vnlawfull entry into <HI>Deuon</HI> and <HI>Cornwall;</HI> but <HI>Hugh Courtney</HI> Earle of <HI>Deuon,</HI> remooued it with <HI>posse Comitatus,</HI> and recommitted them to the woodde~ prison that brought them thither. Yet would not the Scots take so much warning by their successe, as example by their precedent, if at least, <HI>Frois|sarts</HI>
<PB REF="102">
ignorance of our English names, bred not his mis|taking in the place.</P>
<P>By his relation also, <HI>Cornwals</HI> neere neighbourhead gaue oportunity of accesse, both to the Earle <HI>Montford,</HI> when he appealed to that Kings ayd, for recouering his right in Brittaine (albeit I cannot bring home <HI>Cepsee</HI> the designed port of his landing) and after his captiuitie, to the messengers of his heroicall Countesse, employed in the like errand.</P>
<P>And from <HI>Cornwall,</HI> the Earle of <HI>Sarum, Wil. de Mes|uile</HI> and <HI>Philip de Courtney,</HI> set to sea, with 40. ships, be|sides Barks, and 2000. men at armes, besides Archers, in support of that quarrell.</P>
<P>Lastly, his authoritie enformeth me, that those soul|diers of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> who vnder their Captaines <HI>Iohn Apport</HI> and <HI>Iohn Cornwall,</HI> had defended the Fort of Bercherel in Brittaine, against the power of Fraunce, aboue a yeree space, in the end, for want of due succours, vpon an ho|nourable composition surrendred the same.</P>
<P>Queene <HI>Margaret,</HI> wife to <HI>H.</HI> 6. vpon her arriual out of Frau~ce, after the losse of Barnet field, receiued great ayd, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1471.</NOTE> though to smal purpose, fro~ the <HI>Deuon</HI> and <HI>Cornish</HI> men, vnder the conduct of <HI>Thomas,</HI> Earle of that shire.</P>
<P>And so much were those Western people addicted to that name, as they readily followed <HI>Sir Edw. Courtney,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">1485.</NOTE> &amp; his brother <HI>Peter,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Excesler,</HI> what time they assisted the Duke of Buckingham, in his reuolt against <HI>Richard</HI> the third.</P>
<P>Neither did his suppressour and successour, <HI>H.</HI> the 7. finde them more loyall: for the <HI>Cornish</HI> men repining at <NOTE PLACE="marg">1497. <HI>Rebellion</HI></NOTE> a Subsidy lately graunted him by Act of Parliament, were induced to rebellion by <HI>Thomas Flammock,</HI> a Gen|tleman,
<PB N="98" REF="102">
&amp; <HI>Michael Ioseph,</HI> a Black-smith, with whom they marched to <HI>Taunton,</HI> there murdering the Prouost of <HI>perin,</HI> a Commissioner for the sayd Subsidy, and from thence to <HI>Welles,</HI> where <HI>Iames Touchet,</HI> Lord <HI>Audely,</HI> de|generated to their party, with which encrease they pas|sed by <HI>Sarisbury</HI> to <HI>Winchester,</HI> and so into <HI>Kent.</HI> But by this time, Lords &amp; Commons were gathered in stre~gth sufficient, to make head against them, and soone after, black Heath saw the ouerthrow of their forces in bat|tell, and Loudon, the punishment of their seducers by iustice.</P>
<P>In the same fatall yeere of reuolts, <HI>Perkin Warbeck,</HI> a counterfeit Prince, landed in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> went to <HI>Bodmyn,</HI> assembled a trayne of rake-hels, assaulted <HI>Excester,</HI> recey|ued the repulse, and in the end sped, as is knowne, and as he deserued.</P>
<P>The last <HI>Cornish</HI> rebellion, was first occasioned by one <HI>Kilter,</HI> and other his associats of a Westerne parish, <NOTE PLACE="marg">1549.</NOTE> called, <HI>S. Keueren,</HI> who imbrued their wicked hands in the guiltles blood of one M. <HI>Body,</HI> as he sate in Commis|sion at <HI>Helston</HI> for matters of reformation in religion: and the yere following, it grew to a general reuolt, vnder the conduct of <HI>Arundel, Wydeslade; Resogan,</HI> and others, followed by 6000. with which power they marched into <HI>Deuon,</HI> besieged and assaulted <HI>Excester,</HI> &amp; gaue the L. <HI>Russell</HI> (employed with an army against them) more then one hot encounter, which yet (as euer) quayled in their ouerthrow.</P>
<P>In my particular view, I wil make easie iournies from place to place, as they lye in my way, taking the Hun|dreds <NOTE PLACE="marg">Particu|lar de|scription,</NOTE> for my guydes, vntill I haue accomplished this wearisome voyage.</P>
<P><PB REF="103">
My first entrance must be by the hundred of East, so <NOTE PLACE="marg">East Hu~dred. Plymouth hauen.</NOTE> named for his site, and therein, at <HI>Plymmouth</HI> hauen.

at not subiect to co~ptrolment of <HI>Plymmouth</HI> forts. The shore is peopled with some dwelling houses, and many Cellers, dearely rented for a short vsage, in fauing of Pilcherd. At which time, there flocketh a great con|course of Sayners, and others, depending vpon their la|bour. I haue heard the Inhabitants thereabouts to re|port, that the Earle of <HI>Richmond</HI> (afterwards <HI>Henry</HI> the seuenth) while hee houered vpon the coast, here by stealth refreshed himselfe; but being aduertised of streight watch, kept for his surprising at <HI>Plymmouth,</HI> he richly rewarded his hoste, hyed spcedily a shipboord, and escaped happily to a better fortune.</P>
<P>Here also of late yeeres, part of the <HI>Cornish</HI> forces twise encamped themselues, planted some Ordinance, and raised a weake kind of fortification, therethrough to contest, if not repulse, the landing of the expected enemie: and a strong watch is continually kept there, euer since one thousand, fiue hundred, ninetie seuen: at which time, a Spaniard riding on the Bay, while most of the able people gaue their attendance at the Countie Assises, sent some closely into the village, in the darke of the night, who hanged vp barrels of matter fit to take fire, vpon certaine doores, which by a traine should haue burned the houses. But one of the Inhabitants, es|pying these vnwelcome ghests, with the bounce of a Caliuer chaced them aboord, and remoued the barrels, before the traynes came to worke their effect. The In|giner of this practise, (as hath since appeared by some examinations) was a Portugall, who sometimes sayled with Sir <HI>Iohn Borowghs,</HI> and boasted to haue burned his Ship: for which two honourable exploits, the King of Spaine bestowed on him two hundred duckets.</P>

<P>It exceedeth good maners, to inuite your longer stay at our colde harbour; and yet, for that diuers strangers haue, either vpon cause or kindnesse, pretended to like well of a saltwater pond there made; and others, whose <NOTE PLACE="marg">A salt|water pond.</NOTE> dwelling affoordeth a semblable oportunity, may (per|haps) take some light herefrom, to doe the like: if they be so disposed, I will put my selfe to the payne of parti|cularly describing it and you may (notwithstanding) at your pleasure, saue the labour of perusing it; wherein I will by the way interlace some notes, for the Imitaters better instruction.</P>
<P>There lyeth a creeke of Ose, betweene two hilles, which deliuering a little fresh rillet into the sea, re|ceyueth for recompence, a large ouerflowing of the salt water tides. This place is deepened to apond, by casting vp part of the Ose to the heades, part to the middle, and part to the sides: the vpper head stop|peth out the fresh water, the lower keepeth in the salt: the middle rayseth an Iland for the VVork|mens
<PB REF="109">
ease, the owners pleasure, and the fishes succour. The Ose thus aduanced, within short space, through the sunne and winde, changeth his former softnes, to a firmer hardnesse. Round about the pond, there is pit|ched a frith of three foote heighth, sloped inwards, to barre any Otter from issuing, if hee there aduenture his naturall theft, as it would foreclose his entrance, but lose the pastime of his hunting, if the same declined outwards. In one of the corners next the sea, standeth a flood-gate, to bee drawne vp and let downe through reigles in the side postes, whose mouth is encompassed with a double frith, of two foote distance, eche from o|ther, and their middle space filled vp with small stones: this serueth to let in the salt water, and to keepe in the fish, when the flood-gate is taken vp: and therefore you must not make the frith too close, nor the compasse too little, lest they too much stop the waters passage. It riseth of equall heighth with the banks, &amp; they must outreach the highest full sea mark, by two foot at least: neyther ought your flood-gates foote to stand euen with the pondes bottome, lest emptying the water, it wholly abandon the fish, but must leaue about three foot depth within. In the halfe circle enclosed between the flood|gate and the compasse frith, there is digged a round pit, of three foot diameter, and foure foot depth, frithed on the sides, which is continually fedde with the water soa|king from the sayd flood-gate, and serueth to keepe any fish aliue, that you haue before taken, and so to saue ouer often drawing. The flood-gate will hold water best, if his sides bee walled vp with Cob. The pond may not carry one continuall depth; but containe some shallow places, to protect the smaller fish from the greater, and
<PB N="105" REF="109">
for them all to play in, when the weather is hote. In the higher banke there is also a flood-gate, to let in the fresh water, during Summer season, which the fish then best affecteth; the rest of the yeere it is carryed away by a trench, for auoyding diuers discommodities.</P>
<P>Thus much for the making: now to the vse. Such as haue the meanes, may best benefit themselues, by letting in the salt water euery tyde, which is easily done, in ma|king that place, where the water entreth, lower then the bankes and frith, and so suffering the tyde to take his course forth and back, without stop or attendance: and in this case, you may place your flood-gate euen with the floore of your pond, and neuer take it vp, but when you are disposed to view all your store. But mine lieth so high from the mouth of the hauen, as I am driuen to detayne the last prouision, vntill the comming spring|tyde haue taken two daies encrease; at which time, the floodgate is hoysed vp, the olde water let out, and the new admitted. At full sea downe goeth the flood-gate againe, and there abideth, vntill the next day minister the like ocasion: and after this maner is opened and closed, for sixe dayes in the whole, continuing from thenceforth other ten dayes vnmedled withall, to wit, 8. daies of the neap, &amp; two of the spring. Neither doth al this require ouer-lo~g, or busie paines or atte~dance: for if the former water be let out (sauing in extreme cold wea|ther) before any new come in, or stopped somewhat too late, it little skilleth, so as on the last day you keepe the aduantage, which the flood, then at highest, doth giue you.</P>
<P>And all these seruices about my pond, together with sundry other, are performed by an old fellow whome I
<PB REF="110">
keepe for almes, and not for his worke. The best meanes of preuenting leakage, is to let three or foure shouels full of earth fall softly downe, by the inner side of the flood-gate, which will quurt vp his chinkes.</P>
<P>In winter season, sixe foote depth of water, at least, is requisite.</P>
<P>Now touching the fish, this is the maner: When the Pilcherd Sayners cut the most impayred pieces out of their nets, they are bought for a trifle, and serue to make a lesse Sayne, of some 30. or 40. fathom length, and 2. in depth, for this purpose, wherewith, betweene Midsummer and the end of August, when the full sea falleth in the after-noones, my people make draughtes on the shallow places within harbour, and taking small fishes, cast them into the pond: they are kept &amp; brought thither aliue, in a boat halfe full of water, which entreth thorow a little augre hole in the bottome, and so conti|nueth new. The fish thus taken, are commonly Basse, Millet, Guilthead, Whiting, Smelts, Flouk, Plaice, and Sole. The pond also breedeth Crabs, Eeles, &amp; Shrimps; and (in the beginning) Oysters grew vpon boughs of trees (an Indian miracle) which were cast in thither, to serue as a houer for the fish.

<P>The Iland is square, with foure rounds at the cor|ners, like <HI>Mount-Edgecumb.</HI> This should first haue bene planched ouer and rayled about, with ballisters. In the midst, there should haue risen a boorded roome, of the like fashion, but lesser proportion, so to leaue sufficient space betweene that and the rayles for a walke round a|bout: this square roome should within side haue bene sieled roundwise, and in three of the places where
<PB REF="112">
the round ioyned with the square, as many windowes should haue bene set; the fourth should haue serued for a dore. Of the 4. turrets, shut out by this round, one should haue made a kitchin, the second, a store-house, to keepe the fishing implements, the third, a buttery, &amp; the fourth a stayre, for ascending to the next loft: which next loft should haue risen on the flat roofe of the low|er, in a round forme, but of a lesser size againe, so to leaue a second Tarras, like the other: and as the square roome below was sieled round, so should this vpper round roome be sieled square, to the end, that where the side walles and sieling ioyned, three windowes and a doore might likewise find their places. The voyd spa|ces betweene the round and square, hee would haue turned to Cupboardes and boxes, for keeping other necessary vtensiles, towards these sishing feasts.</P>

<P>About 40. yeres agoe, it chanced, that a boat ouer|fraighted with people, in rowing downe the riuer from Saltash market, was by the extreme weather, sunk, neere to a place called Henpoint, and all the folke drowned, sa|uing one onely woman, named <HI>Agnes,</HI> the wife of one <HI>Cornish,</HI> whome it pleased God so to protect and direct, that in her first popping vp againe (which most liuing

<P>The woman thus freed from one perill at sea, aduen|tured another of little lesse consequence at land; for be|ing not yet throughly restored to her se~se, she clymed vp the cliffe in such a steepe place, as the very consideration thereof, doth euer sithence halfe amaze the beholders. But that ground was foreordained to her good: for not long after, her husband tooke the same, with the rest of the tenement, in lease; and it now serueth her for a dwelling, and many others, by her charitie, for a re|liefe.</P>

They are held to be father and sonne, and that the sonne slayne in our warres with Fraunce, was from thence brought home to be here interred.

Wherefore, to try what truth res|ted in these reports, some Gent. dwelling not farre off, caused a boate and nets to be carried thither ouer land. Fish they caught none, saue a fewe Eeles vpon hookes: the poole prooued no where past a fathome and halfe deepe, and for a great way very shallow. Touching the opinion of ebbing and stowing, it should seeme to bee grounded, partly vpon the increase, which the raine floods brought thereinto fro~ the bordering hils (which perhaps gaue also the name; for <HI>Doz,</HI> is, come, and <HI>maur,</HI> great) and the decrease, occasioned by the next drowth, and partly, for that the windes doe driue the waues to and fro, vpon those sandie bankes: and thus the mira|cle of Dosmery poole deceased.

<P>In our forefathers daies, when deuotion as much ex|ceeded
<PB N="123" REF="127">
knowledge, as knowledge now commeth short of deuotion, there were many bowssening places, for curing of mad men, and amongst the rest, one at Alter|nunne in this Hundred, called <HI>S.

<P>The water running from <HI>S. Nunnes</HI> well, fell into a square and close walled plot, which might bee filled at what depth they lifted. Vpon this wall was the fran|ticke person set to stand, his backe towards the poole, and from thence with a sudden blow in the brest, tum|bled headlong into the pond: where a strong fellowe, prouided for the nonce, tooke him, and tossed him vp and downe, alongst and athwart the water, vntill the pa|tient, by forgoing his strength, had somewhat forgot his fury. Then was hee conueyed to the Church, and cer|taine Masses sung ouer him; vpon which handling, if his right wits returned, <HI>S.

<HEAD>Trigge Hundred.</HEAD>
<P>THe name of Trig, in <HI>Cornish,</HI> signifieth an Inhabitant; howbeit, this Hundred cannot vaunt any ouer-large scope, or extaordinarie plenty of dwellings: his chiefe towne is Bodmyn; in <HI>Cornish, Bos venna,</HI> commonly ter|med Bodman, which (by illusion, if not Etimology) a man might, not vnaptly, turne into Badham: for of all the townes in <HI>Cornwall,</HI> I holde none more healthfully seated, then Saltash, or more contagiously, then this. It consisteth wholly (in a maner) of one street, leading East and West, welneere the space of an Eastern mile, whose South side is hidden from the Sunne, by an high hill, so neerely coasting it in most places, as neither can light haue entrance to their staires, nor open ayre to their o|ther roomes. Their back houses, of more necessary, then cleanly seruice, as kitchins, stables, &amp;c. are clymed vp vnto by steps, and their filth by euery great showre, washed downe thorow their houses into the streetes.</P>
<P>The other side is also ouerlooked by a great hill, though somewhat farther distant: and for a <HI>Corollarium,</HI> their conduit water runneth thorow the Churchyard, the ordinary place of buriall, for towne and parish. It breedeth therefore little cause of maruaile, that euery generall infection is here first admitted, &amp; last excluded: yet the many decayed houses, proue the towne to haue bene once very populous; and, in that respect, it may stil retaine the precedence, as supported by a weekly mar|ket, the greatest of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> the quarter Sessions for the East diuision, and halfe yeerely faires. The iurisdiction thereof is administred by a Maior and his brethren, and
<PB N="124" REF="128">
vpon warrant of their Charter, they claime authoritie, to take acknowledgement of statute bonds.</P>
<P>In former times, the Bishop of <HI>Cornwall</HI> (as I haue elsewhere related) held his See at <HI>S. Petroe's,</HI> in this towne, vntill the Danish pirats, firing their Palace, for|ced <NOTE PLACE="marg">981.</NOTE> them to remoue the same, with their residence, vnto <HI>S. Germans.</HI> They were succeeded by a Priory, and Fri|ery; which later, serued a while as a house of correction, for the shire, but with greater charge, then benefit, or continuance.</P>
<P>For other accidents, I find, that <HI>Perkyn Warbecke,</HI> af|ter <NOTE PLACE="marg">11. H. 7. <HI>Warbeck.</HI></NOTE> his landing in the West parts of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> made this towne the <HI>Rendez vous</HI> of his assembling forces, for at|chieuing his, alike deseruing, and speeding enterprise against King <HI>Henry</HI> the seuenth.</P>
<P>Hither, also, in the last commotion, flocked the Re|bels, <NOTE PLACE="marg">3. <HI>Ed.</HI> 6.</NOTE> from all quarters of the shire, pitching their campe at the townes end; and here they imprisoned such Gen|tlemen, as they had plucked out of their holdes, and houses, vntill the fortune of warre gaue verdit with the right of iustice, for their well deserued euill spee|ding.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Anthony Kingston,</HI> then Prouost-marshall of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir An|thony Kingston.</NOTE> Kings armie, hath left his name more memorable, then commendable amongst the townsemen, for causing their Maior to erect a gallowes before his owne doore, vpon which, (after hauing feasted Sir <HI>Anthony)</HI> himselfe was hanged.</P>
<P>In like sort (say they) he trussed vp a millers man, thereby, for that he presented himselfe in the others stead, saying he could neuer do his master better ser|uice.</P>
<P><PB REF="129">
But mens tongues, readily inclined to the worst re|ports, haue left out a part of the truth, in this tale, that the rest might carrie the better grace. For Sir <HI>Anthony</HI> did nothing herein, as a Iudge, by discretion, but as an officer, by direction; and besides, hee gaue the Maior sufficient watchwordes of timely warning, &amp; large space of respite (more then which, in regard of his owne perill, he could not afford) to shift for safety, if an vneschewable destiny, had not haltered him to that aduancement. As for the millers man, he equalled his master, in their common offence of rebellion, and there|fore it deserued the praise of mercy, to spare one of the two, and not the blame of crueltie, to hang one for ano|ther.</P>
<P>I should perhaps haue forgotten the free schoole here, maintayned by her Maiesties liberalitie, were I not <NOTE PLACE="marg">Free schoole.</NOTE> put in mind thereof, through afore-halsening of this re|bellion, by an action of the schollers, which I will report from some of their owne mouthes. About a yeere be|fore this sturre was raysed, the schollers, who accusto|mably diuide themselues, for better exploiting their pas|times, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Childre~s forehal|sening of warre.</NOTE> grewe therethrough into two factions; the one whereof, they called the olde religion; the other, the new. This once begunne, was prosecuted amongst the~ in all exercises, and, now and then, handled with some egernesse and roughnes, each partie knowing, and still keeping the same companions, and Captaine. At last one of the boyes, conuerted the spill of an olde candle|sticke to a gunne, charged it with powder and a stone, and (through mischance, or vngraciousnesse) therewith killed a calfe: whereupon, the owner complayned, the master whipped, and the diuision ended.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="129">
By such tokens, sometimes wonderfull, sometimes ridiculous, doth God at his pleasure, foreshewe future accidents: as in the Planets, before the battell at Thra|simenus, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Li.

Yea (to bring these examples neerer home) the like hath hapned both be|fore and sithence, amongst boyes in other places.</P>
<P>When <HI>Caesar</HI> was departed from Rome, to try the title <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dion Cassius.</NOTE> of the worlds Empire with <HI>Pompey,</HI> the towne boyes (without any mans commaund) parted in twayne; the one side calling themselues Pompeyans, the other Cae|sarians; and then darrayning a kinde of battell (but without Armes) the Caesarians got the ouerhand.</P>
<P>A like prank vnder the like assumed names, and with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Idem.</NOTE> like successe and boding, they plaied, when <HI>Octauius</HI> and <HI>Anthony</HI> were, with like meanes, to decide the like So|ueraignty.</P>
<P>And to the same purpose, <HI>Procopius</HI> affirmeth, that the <NOTE PLACE="marg">De bello Gothico L. primo.</NOTE> Samnite boyes, when they draue their cattel to feeding, after their vsuall maner of pastime, chose out amongst themselues, two of the best actiuity and seemelinesse; the one, they named <HI>Bellisarius,</HI> Generall for <HI>Iustinian</HI> the Emperour in Italy, the other <HI>Vitiges</HI> king of the Gothes,
<PB REF="130">
against whome hee wanted. In the buckling of these counterfeite Commaunders, it fell out, that <HI>Vitiges</HI> had the worst, whome the aduerse party with a iesting and craking maner, hanged vp at the next tree, in earnest, but yet with no intent to kill him.</P>
<P>This while it happens, that a Woolfe is descryed&punc; away runne the boyes: fast abides the imaginary Fe|lon, and so fast, that for want of timely rescouse, the breath poasted out of his body, and left the same a liuelesse carkase. The which notifyed to the Sam|nites, quitted the striplings (or slipstrings) of their pu|nishment, but encreased the dismay of the elder peo|ple.</P>
<P>A like accident befell sithence, by testimony of the ceremonious <HI>Texera,</HI> as a presage of <HI>Lewes</HI> the Prince of Condyes death, 1509. Foure daies before which, at Xaintes, the youth of all sorts, from 9. to 22. yeres age, assembled, and (of their owne accord) chose two Com|maunders, one they entitled the Prince of Condy, the other <HI>Mounsieur,</HI> who then lay in the field against him. For three dayes space, they violently assaulted each o|ther, with stones, clubs, and other weapons, vntill at last it grewe to Pistoles: by one of which, the imaginary Prince receiued a quelling wound in his head, about 10. a clock in the morning: the very howre (faith this Por|tugall confessour) that the Prince himselfe, by a like shot was slaughtered.</P>
<P>The same authour voucheth a semblable chaunce, somewhat before the siege of Rochell 1572. where, some of the boyes banded themselues, as for the Maior, and others for the King; who after 6. dayes skirmishing, at last made a composition, and departed: euen as that
<PB N="126" REF="130">
siege endured sixe moneths, and finally brake vp in a peace.</P>
<P>So doth <HI>Mercurius Gallobelgicus</HI> giue vs to wit, that in the yeere 1594. a Turkish Beglerbey of Greece, either seeking by a fore-coniecture, to be ascertained himselfe, or desirdus to nusle the yonger sort in martiall exployts, led out of <HI>Alba Regalis,</HI> about 600. Turkish boyes, aged betweene 11. and 14. yeeres, and seuered them into two troups, terming the one, The Christian, the other, The Turkish batalion. Those, he directed to call vpon <HI>Iesus,</HI> these, vpon <HI>Hala:</HI> both parts hee enioyned to bicker co|ragiously, and egged them onward with the enticeme~t of rewards. The token is giuen, the forces encounter, the fight is hote. In the end, the Turks betake them|selues to their heeles, and Iesus party carryeth away the victory, But such occurrents do not alwayes either fore|goe, or foresignifie; for sometimes they fall out idle, and sometimes not at all. How beit, <HI>Nicetaes Chaniates</HI> taketh it very vnkindly, that God would not spare some watch|word out of his prescie~ce, to the Constantinopolitanes, what time <HI>Baldryn</HI> Earle of Flaunders and others, first assisted, and then conquered their Citie.</P>
<P>Touching <HI>Veall</HI> the Merecurialist, I haue spoken in my former booke.</P>
<P>The youthlyer sort of Bodmyn townsmen vse some|times to sport themselues, by playing the box with stra~|gers, whome they summon to Halgauer. The name <NOTE PLACE="marg">Halga|uer.</NOTE> signifieth the Goats moore, and such a place it is, lying a little without the towne, and very full of quauemires. When these mates meete with any rawe seruingman, or other young master, who may serue and deserue to make pastime, they cause him to be solemnely arrested,
<PB REF="131">
for his appearance before the Maior of Halgauer, where he is charged with wearing one spurre, or going vntrus|sed, or wanting a girdle, or some such like felony: and after he hath beene arraygned and tryed, with all requi|site circumstances, iudgement is giuen in formatterines, and executed in some one vngracious pranke or o|ther, more to the skorne, then hurt of the party con|demned.</P>
<P>Hence is sprung the prouerb, when we see one sto|uenly appareled, to say, He shall be presented in Halg|uer Court.</P>
<P>But now and then, they extend this merriment with the largest, to the preiudice of ouer-credulous people, perswading them to fight with a Drago~ lurking in Hal|gauer, or to see some stra~ge matter there which conclu|deth at least, with a trayning them into the mire.</P>
<P>Within short space after the great same dispersed, touching the rare effects of Warwickshire wels, some idle enuious head raysed a brute, that there rested no lesse vertue (forsooth) for healing all diseases, in a plenti|full spring, neere vnto Bodmyn, called <HI>Scarlets</HI> well: which report grew so farre, and so fast, that folke ranne <NOTE PLACE="marg">Scarlets well.</NOTE> slocking thither in huge numbers, from all quarters. But the neighbour Iustices, finding the abuse, and looking into the consequence, forbad the resort, lequestred the spring, and suppressed the miracle.

<P>East-Loo voucheth lesse antiquity, as lately incorpo|rated, but vanteth greater wealth, as more co~modiously seated: yet the foundation of their houses is grounded on the sand, supporting (naythelesse) those poore buil|dings, with a sufficient stablenesse. Their profit chiefly accrueth from their weekely markets, and industrious fishing, with boats of a middle size, able to brooke, but not crosse the seas: howbeit, they are not altogether des|titute of bigger shipping: amongst which, one hath suc|cessiuely retained the name of the <HI>George</HI> of Loo, euer since the first so called, did a great while fithence, in a fu|rious fight, take;.

<P>But I will returne to the towne. During the war|like raignes of our two valiant <HI>Edwards,</HI> the first &amp; third, the Foyens addicted themselues to backe their Princes quarrell, by coping with the enemy at sea, and made re|turne of many prizes: which purchases hauing aduan|ced them to a good estate of wealth, the same was (whe~ the quieter conditioned times gaue meanes) heedfully and diligently employed, and bettered, by the more ci|uill trade of marchandise; and in both these vocations they so fortunately prospered, that it is reported, 60. tall ships did, at one time, belong to the harbour, and that they assisted the siege of Callais, with 47. saile. Heere|on, a full purse begetting a stout stomack, our Foyens tooke heart at grasse, and chauncing about that time (I speake vpon the credit of tradition) to sayle neere Rye, and Winchelsea, they stifly refused to vaile their bonets at the summons of those townes; which contempt (by
<PB N="135" REF="139">
the better enabled Sea-farers, reckoned intolerable) caused the Ripiers to make out with might and mayne against them; howbeit, with a more hardy onset, then happy issue: for the Foy men gaue them so rough en|tertaynment at their welcome, that they were glad to forsake patch, without bidding farewell: the me|rit of which exploit, afterwards entitled them Gallants of Foy: and (it may bee) they sought to eternize this memorable fact, after the Greeke and Romane maner, by inuesting the towne of Golant with that name: not|withstanding, <HI>quaere,</HI> whether a causelesse ambitio~ in the postetitie, turned not rather Golant into Gallant, for their greater glory. Once, the townesmen vaunt, that for teskuing certaine ships of Rye from the Normans in <HI>Henrie</HI> the thirds time, they beare the armes, and enioy part of the priuiledges appertaining to the Cinque|ports, whereof there is some memorie in their Chaun|cell window, with the name of <HI>Fisart Bagga,</HI> their principall Commaunder in that seruice. Moreouer, the prowesse of one <HI>Nicholas,</HI> sonne to a widdow, neere Foy, is deskanted vpon, in an old three mans songs, namely, how he fought brauely at sea, with <HI>Iohn Dory</HI> (a Geno|wey, as I coniecture) set forth by <HI>Iohn</HI> the French king, and (after much bloudshed on both sides) tooke, and slew him, in reuenge of the great rauine, and crueltie, which hee had forecommitted, vpon the English mens goods and bodies. Yet their so often good successe, sometimes tasted the sawce of crosser speeding; for <HI>Tho. Walsingham</HI> telleth vs, that Sir <HI>Hugh Calueley,</HI> and Sir <HI>Th.

time, limited for the like seruice, was then sayling home|wards, neither would be entreated by those knights, to ioyne companie with them: howbeit they bought this refusall verie deare. For no sooner was the English fleete past out of sight, but that a Flemmish man of warre ligh|ted vpon them, and (after a long, and strong resistance) ouermastred them as well, at last in force, as they did at first in number, tooke the Barge, sunk it, and slaughtered all the Saylers, one onely boy excepted, who in the heate of the bickering, seeing which way the game would goe, secretly stole aboord the Flemming, and closely hid himselfe amongst the ballast.

<P>Not long after, our Foy gallants, vnable to beare a low sayle, in their fresh gale of fortune, began to skum the Seas, with their often piracies, (auowing themselues vpon the Earle of Warwicke, whose ragged staffe is yet to be seene, pourtrayed in many places of their Church Steeple, and in diuers priuate houses) as also to violate their dutie at land, by insolent disobedience, to the Prin|ces Officers, cutting off (amongst other pranckes) a Pur|siuants eares: whereat king <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth conceiued such indignation, as hee sent Commissioners vnto <HI>Lost|withiel,</HI> (a towne there by) who, vnder pretence of vsing their seruice, in sea affaires, trained thither the greatest number of the Burgesses; and no sooner come, then laid hold on, and in hold, their goods were confiscated, one <HI>Harrington</HI> executed, the chaine of their hauen remoued to Dartmouth, &amp; their wonted iolity transformed into

Not many yeres sithence, a Gentleman, dwelling not farre off, was perswaded, by some information, or ima|gination, that treasure lay hidden vnder this stone: wherefore, in a faire Moone-shine night, thither with certaine good fellowes hee hyeth to dig it vp: a work|ing they fall, their labour shortneth, their hope increa|seth, a pot of Gold is the least of their expectation.

<P>Other letters from the King there are, whose date is not expressed, neither can I by any meanes hunt it out.</P>

<P>These few notes I haue culled out of many others.

Ouer his kinred, hee held a warie and charie care, which bountifully was expressed, when occasion so required, reputing himselfe, not onely principall of the family, but a generall father to them all. Priuate re|spects euer, with him, gaue place to the common good: as for franke, well ordered, and continuall hospitalitie, he outwent all shew of competence: spare, but discreet

of speech, better conceiuing, then deliuering: equally stout, and kind, not vpon lightnesse of humour, but soundnesse of iudgement, inclined to commiseration, readie to relieue. Briefely, so accomplished in vertue, that those, who for many yeeres together wayted in neerest place about him, and, by his example, learned to hate vntruth, haue often deepely protested, how no cu|rious obseruation of theirs, could euer descrie in him, any one notorious vice.

The younger brother followeth the Netherland wars, with so wel-liked a cariage, that hee outgoeth his age, and time of seruice, in preferment. Their mother equal|leth her husbands former children, and generally all his kinred, in kind vsage, with her owne, and is by them all, againe, so acknowledged and respected.</P>
<P>Of Saint Peran, wee haue spoken before, which too well brooketh his surname, in Sabulo: for the light-sand, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Peran in Zabulo.</NOTE> carried vp by the North wind, from the sea shore, daily continueth his couering, and marring the land adioy|nant, so as the distresse of this deluge, draue the Inha|bitants to remooue their Church: howbeit, when it meeteth with any crossing brooke, the same (by a secret antipathy) restraineth, and barreth his farder incroching that way.</P>

<P>The riuer Fala, falling here, into the seas wide-gaping mouth, hath endowed it with that name.</P>
<P>In the very entrance of the harbour lyeth a rocke, rather disgracing, then endamaging the same: for with the cbbe it is discouered, and at the flood, marked by a pole purposely fixed thereupon. For the rest, such as compare Plymmouth and Falmouth together, obserue, that Plymmouth creekes are mostly coasted with plaine shoares; Falmouth, with steepe: which maketh that, the more delightfull for prospect, this, the more safe for ri|ding. Againe, they say that Falmouth lyeth farther out in the trade way, and so offreth a sooner oportunity to wind-driuen shipping, then Plymmouth, but that Plym|mouth hath a better outlet, from his Catwater, for say|lers

bound to the Westwards, and from Hamoase, for those that would fare to the East, then Falmouth. Like|wise as <HI>Plymmouth</HI> vaunteth richer and fairer townes, and greater plentie of fish then Falmouth: so Falmouth braggeth, that a hundred sayle may Anker within his circuite, and no one of them see the others top, which <HI>Plymmouth</HI> cannot equall. Howsoeuer they agree for competence among themselues, the worst of them, by most mens iudgements, hath the precedence (Mil|ford onely excepted) of all other Hauens in England. And thus much of the whole. Now to the parts.</P>
<P>On the West side, at the verie comming in, there ri|seth a hill, called Pendenis, where king <HI>Henrie</HI> the eight, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pendenis fort.</NOTE> when hee tooke order for fortifying the Sea coasts, cau|sed a Castle to bee builded, with allowance of a pettie Garrison, and some small store of Ordinance. Another, somewhat like thereto in plot, but different in sight, was then erected in the other side, at Saint Mawes, of which I haue spoken heretofore. <NOTE PLACE="marg">S. Mawes Castle.</NOTE></P>
<P>Saint Mawes lieth lower, and better to annoy ship|ping: but Pendenis standeth higher, and stronger to de|fend it selfe. It should seeme, the fortifier made his ad|uantage of the commoditie, affoorded by the ground, and shot rather at a safe preseruing the Harbour, from sodaine attempts of little Fleetes, and the mastering of Pirates, then to withstand any great Nauie, or maigne inuasion.</P>
<P>But her Maiestie casting an equall eye to both, or rather a sharper sight to this later, as quickned through the enemies diuers pretences against these places (wher|of Falmouth, by myracle, not prouidence, escaped one) raysed a newe fort with a Garrison, vpon the

Hawe at <HI>Plymmouth,</HI> and at her great charges, with some litte helpe of the Countrie, added an increase of fortification, and souldiers to Pendenis.

<P>The three &amp; twentieth of Iuly; 1595 soone after the Sun was raised, and had chased a fogge, which before kept the sea out of sight, 4. Gallies of the enemy presented themselues vpon the coast, ouer-against Mousehole,
<PB REF="161">
and there in a faire Bay, landed about two hundred men, pikes and shot, who foorthwith sent their for|lorne hope, consisting of their basest people, vnto the stragled houses of the countrie, about halfe a mile com|passe or more, by whome were burned, not onely the houses they went by, but also the Parish Church of <HI>Paul,</HI> the force of the fire being such, as it vtterly rui|ned all the great stonie pillers thereof: others of them in that time, burned that fisher towne Mowsehole, the rest <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mouse|hole.</NOTE> marched as a gard for defence of these firers. The Inha|bitants being feared with the Spaniards landing and burning, fled from their dwellings, and verie meanely weaponed, met with Sir <HI>Francis Godolphin</HI> on a greene, on the West side of Pensance, who that forenoone comming from his house, for pacifying some contro|uersies in those Westerne parts, and from the hils espy|ing the fires in that towne, Church, and houses, haste|ned thither: Who foorthwith sent to all the Captaines of those parts, for their speedie repaire with their com|panies, and also sent by Poast to Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> and Sir <HI>Iohn Hawkins</HI> (then at <HI>Plymmouth</HI> with a fleete bound for the Indies) aduertisement of the arriuall of these foure Gallies, and of their burnings, aduising them to looke to themselues, if there were any greater fleete of the enemies at Sea, and to send West with all haste, what succours by sea or land they could spare. Then Sir <HI>Francis Godalphin</HI> aduised that weake assembly, to retire into Pensance, and to prepare it for defence, vntill the comming of the Countrie forces that hee had sent for. But they finding themselues in number something a|boue a hundred, wherein were about thirtie or fortie shot, though scarce one third of them were seruiceable,
<PB N="157" REF="161">
insisted to march against the enemies, to repell them from farther spoyles of their houses.</P>
<P>But while they were marching towards them, the Spaniards returned aboord their Gallyes, and presently remooued them farther into the Bay, where they an|chored againe, before and neere a lesser fisher towne, called Newlyn.</P>
<P>There againe with all speede they landed, and imbat|telled in the slope of a hill, about foure hundred pikes and shot, sending about two rankes of souldiers, three in a ranke, vp to the top of the hill, to discouer what forces or ambushes of the Countrey might lye in view: who espying none but those that were returned with <HI>Sir Frauncis Godolphin,</HI> from their forementioned fruit|lesse march, gaue notice thereof to their imbattelled company. Wherevpon they forthwith marched to|wards Penzance.</P>
<P>Vpon their moouing, Sir <HI>Frauncis Godolphin</HI> moued also, to enter Penzance before them: and assoone as that weake number were entred into the open greene being of three quarters of a mile length, the Gallyes ceased not to plye them all that way with their ordi|nance from their prowes, as busily as they could. Of which shot, though none were hurt, but onely a Con|stable vnhorsed without any harme, sauing the shew on his doublet of the bullets sliding by his back, yet many in fearefull maner, some fell flat to the ground, and others ranne away.</P>
<P><HI>Sir Frauncis</HI> sent after those that were entred Pen|zance before him, that they should make their stand at the market place, himselfe staying hindmost, to obserue
<PB REF="162">
the enemies order, and which way they would make their approach. Which done, he found at the said mar|ket place but onely two resolute shot, who stood at his commaund, and some ten or twelue others that follo|wed him, most of them his owne seruants; the rest, sur|prised with feare, fled, whom, neither with his perswa|sions, nor threatning with his rapier drawne, hee could recall.</P>
<P>Finding himselfe thus abandoned, and the enemies entred the towne in three parts, hee was then forced to depart, the enemies beginning their fire some houses behinde him. The towne thus fired, as also the fore|mentioned little fisher towne Newlyn, they returned againe to their Gallies.</P>
<P>By this time, towards the euening, the <HI>Cornish</HI> forces encreased in nomber, and amended in heart, encamped themselues on the greene, neere to the towne of Mar|kesew and S. <HI>Michaels</HI> Mount, for defence thereof, and there spent out the night. The next day the enemy made showe to land againe on the West side of the bay; but seeing the people, though few in number, yet resolute to resist, they desisted from their enterprize: and besides, finding themselues annoyed by the shooting of bullets and arrowes into their Gallies where they roade at an|chor, they were forced to remoue them farther off.</P>
<P>Soone after, <HI>viz.</HI> on the 25. of Iuly in the morning, came thither <HI>Sir Nic. Clifford, Sir H. Power,</HI> and certaine other Captaines, who were sent by the Generals from Plym mouth to the campe: As some of her Maiesties ships were also sent, who being come as farre as the Li|zard head, &amp; those Captaines to the camp, matters there
<PB N="158" REF="162">
goe on in prouident and orderly sort, a plot is layd for intercepting the enemy by ambush, if he thrust on shore againe, whereto necessity must soone haue pressed him, for renuing his consumed store of fresh water: but with|in one houre after the arriuall of these Captaines, the winde, which was vntill then strong at Southeast, with mist and rayne, to haue impeached the Gallies returne, suddenly changed into the Northwest, with very fayre and cleare weather, as if God had a purpose to preserue these his rods for a longer time. The winde no sooner came good, but away pack the Gallies with all the haste they could.</P>
<P>Thus haue you a summary report of the Spaniards glorious enterprise, and the <HI>Cornish</HI> mens infamous co|wardise, which (were there any cause) I could qualify by many reasons, as, the suddennesse of the attempt, the narrownesse of the cou~try, the opennesse of the towne, the aduantage of the Gallies ordinance on a people vn|prepared against such accidents, through our long con|tinued peace, &amp; at that very time, for the most part, ey|ther in their Tynne-workes, or at sea, who e're the next day made resistance, euen with a handfull, and entred a vowed resolution, to reuenge their losse at the next en|counter, if the enemy had landed againe.</P>
<P>So might I likewise say, that all these circum|stances meeting in any other quarter of the Realme, would hardly haue produced much better effects. But I will not seeke to thrust my Countrymen into any other folkes company, for shifting them out of sight.</P>
<P>Verily such sudden surprizes worke more indignity
<PB REF="163">
then dammage, and more dammage then disgrace, and haue so beene euer construed. Moscho, a head Citie in a populous dominion, was burned by the roguing Tartars, <HI>anno Domini</HI> 1572. The Capitoll, a head for|tresse, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Liu. lib.</HI> 3</NOTE> in a populous Citie, was taken by slaues and out|lawes, <HI>anno vrbis,</HI> 292. and yet, who therefore exalteth the Tartars valiancy, aboue the Moschouite, or the Ro|manes slaues &amp; outlawes, aboue their masters? Besides, such nap-taking assaults, spoylings, and firings, haue in our forefathers daies, betweene vs and Fraunce, beene very common; and yet, who is so witlesse, as to twite ey|ther of both, for the same?</P>
<P>But least hold can the author, and actor of this Tra|gedy take, to build any vaunt hereon: for oftentimes small troups of ours, against farre greater forces of theirs, yea (sometimes) after forewarning, and preparance, haue wonne, possessed, ransacked, synged, captiued, and carri|ed away the townes, wealth, and Inhabitants, not onely of their Indies, but of Portugall and Spaine it selfe. Which <HI>Nombre de dios, S. Domingo,</HI> Cartagena, the lower towne of the Groigne, Penecha, the suburbs of Lisbone, and Cales wil testify, beyond all exception. But our Countrymen leauing reason &amp; example, excuse themselues by destiny. In <HI>fatis</HI> they say (&amp; not in <HI>fatuis)</HI> it was, that the <HI>Cornish</HI> people should vndergo this misfor|tune: for an ancient prophecy, in their owne language, hath long run amongst the~, how there should land vpon the rock of <HI>Merlin,</HI> those that would burn Pauls Church, Pensants, and Newlyn. And indeed, so is the rocke cal|led, where the enemy first stept on shore. The prophesy is this:</P>
