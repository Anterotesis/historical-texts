<HEAD>A
Further Account
Of the Province of
PENNSYLVANIA
AND ITS
IMPROVEMENTS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">For the Satisfaction of tho&s;e that are Adventurers, and
enclined to be &s;o.</HEAD>
<P>IT has, I know, been much expected from me, that I
&s;hould give &s;ome farther Narrative of tho&s;e parts of
<HI>America,</HI> where I am chiefly intere&s;ted, and have
lately been; having continued there above a Year
after my <HI>former Relation,</HI> and receiving &s;ince my
return, the fre&s;he&s;t and fulle&s;t Advices of its <HI>Progre&s;s</HI>
and <HI>Improvement.</HI> But as the rea&s;on of my coming back, was a
<HI>Difference</HI> between the <HI>Lord Baltamore</HI> and my &s;elf, about the
<HI>Lands of Delaware,</HI> in con&s;equence, reputed of mighty mo|ment
to us, &s;o I wav'd publi&s;hing any thing that might look
in favour of the Country or inviting to it, whil&s;t it lay un|der
the Di&s;couragement and Di&s;reputation of that Lord's claim
and pretences.</P>
<P>But &s;ince they are, after many fair and full hearings before
the <HI>Lords</HI> of the <HI>Committee</HI> for <HI>Plantations</HI> ju&s;tly and happily
<HI>Di&s;mi&s;t,</HI> and the things agreed; and that the <HI>Letters</HI>
which daily pre&s;s me from all Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters">s, on the &s;ubject of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="2">
are &s;o many and voluminous, that to an&s;wer them &s;e|verally,
were a Task too heavy, and repeated to perform, I
have thought it mo&s;t ea&s;ie to the Enquirer, as well as my &s;elf,
to make this Account <HI>Publick,</HI> le&s;t my &s;ilence, or a more pri|vate
intimation of things, &s;hould di&s;oblige the ju&s;t inclinations
of any to <HI>America,</HI> and at a time too, when an extraordina|ry
Providence &s;eems to favour its Plantation, and open a
Door to <HI>Europeans</HI> to pa&s;s thither. That then which is my
part to do in this Adverti&s;ement is,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>To Relate our Progre&s;s, e&s;pecially &s;ince my la&s;t of the
Month called</HI> Augu&s;t 83.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The Capacity of the Place for farther Improvement,
in order to Trade and Commerce.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, <HI>Which Way tho&s;e that are Adventurers; or incline to be
&s;o, may imploy their Money to a fair and &s;ecure Profit;</HI> &s;uch as
&s;hall equally encourage Poor and Rich, which cannot fail of Advancing the Country in con&s;equence.</P>
<P>I. We have had about NINETY SAYL <HI>of Ships with</HI>
PASSENGERS &s;ince the beginning of 82. and not one
Ve&s;&s;el, de&s;igned to the <HI>Province,</HI> through Gods mercy, hi|therto
mi&s;carried.</P>
<P>The E&s;timate of the People may be thus made; <HI>Eighty</HI>
to each Ship, which comes to SEVEN THOUSAND
TWO-HUNDRED PERSONS: At lea&s;t a <HI>Thou&s;and</HI>
there before, with &s;uch as from other Places in our neigh|bourhood
are &s;ince come to re&s;ide among us: And I pre&s;ume
the <HI>Births</HI> at lea&s;t equal to the <HI>Burials:</HI> For having made
our fir&s;t Settlement high in the <HI>Fre&s;hes</HI> of the Rivers, we do
not finde our &s;elves &s;ubject to tho&s;e Sea&s;onings that affect
&s;ome other Countries upon the &s;ame Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The People are a <HI>Collection</HI> of divers Nations in <HI>Europe:</HI> As,
<HI>French, Dutch, Germans, Sweeds, Danes, Finns, Scotch' Iri&s;h,</HI> and
<PB N="3" REF="2">
<HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and of the la&s;t equal to all the re&s;t: And which is
admirable, not a Reflection on that Account: But as they
are of one kind, and in one Place, and under One Allegiance,
&s;o they live like People of <HI>One County;</HI> which Civil Union has
had a con&s;iderable influence towards the pro&s;perity of that
Place.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and our intended Metropolis, as I for|merly
Writ, is two Miles long, and a Mile broad, and at each
end it lies <HI>thot</HI> mile, <HI>upon a Navigable River.</HI> The &s;cituation
<HI>high</HI> and <HI>dry,</HI> yet repleni&s;hed with <HI>running &s;treams.</HI> Be&s;ides the
High-Street, that runs in the midle from River to River,
and is an <HI>hundred foot</HI> broad, it has Eight Streets more that
run the &s;ame cour&s;e, the lea&s;t of which is <HI>fifty foot</HI> in breath.
And be&s;ides Broad-Street, which cro&s;&s;eth the Town in the
middle, and is al&s;o an hundred foot wide, there are twenty
&s;treets more, that run the &s;ame cour&s;e, and are al&s;o fifty foot
broad. The names of tho&s;e Streets are mo&s;tly taken from
the things that Spontaneou&s;ly grow in the Country, <HI>As Vine-Street,
Mulbery-Street, Che&s;nut-Srteet, Wallnut-Street, Strawbery-Street,
Cranbery-Street, Plumb-Street, Hickery-Street, Pine-Street,
Oake-Street, Beach-Street, A&s;h-Street, Popler-Street, Sa&s;&s;afrax-Street,
and the like.</HI></P>
<P>III. I mentioned in my la&s;t Account, that from my Arival
in <HI>Eighty two,</HI> to the Date thereof, being ten Moneths, we had
got up <HI>Four-&s;core</HI> Hou&s;es at our Town, and that &s;ome Villages
were &s;etled about it. From that time to my coming away,
which was a Year within a few Weeks, the Town advanced
to <HI>Three hundred and fifty &s;even Hou&s;es;</HI> divers of them, large,
well built, with good Cellars, three &s;tories, and &s;ome with
<HI>Belconies.</HI></P>
<P>IV. There is al&s;o a fair <HI>Key</HI> of about three hundred foot
&s;quare, Built by <HI>Samuel Carpenter,</HI> to which a Ship of <HI>five
hundred Tuns</HI> may lay her broade &s;ide: and others intend to
<PB N="4" REF="3">
follow his example. We have al&s;o a Rope-walk made by
<HI>B. Wilcox,</HI> and cordage for &s;hipping already &s;pun at it.</P>
<P>V. There inhabits mo&s;t &s;orts of u&s;eful Trades-men, As
<HI>Carpenters, Joyners, Bricklayers, Ma&s;ons, Pla&s;terers, Plumers,
Smiths, Gla&s;iers, Taylers, Shoemakers, Butchers, Bakers, Brewers,
Glovers, Tanners, Felmongers, Wheelrights, Millrights, Shiprights,
Boatrights, Ropemakers, Saylmakers Blockmakers, Turners</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>VI. There are <HI>Two Markets</HI> every Week and <HI>Two Fairs</HI>
every Year. In other places Markets al&s;o, as at <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> and
<HI>New-Ca&s;tle.</HI></P>
<P>VII. Seven <HI>Ordinaries</HI> for the Intertainment of <HI>Strangers</HI>
and <HI>Work-Men,</HI> that are not Hou&s;e-keepers, and a good Meal
to be had for &s;ixpence, &s;terl.</P>
<P>VIII. The hours for Work and Meals to <HI>Labourers,</HI> are
fixt, and known by Ring of <HI>Bell.</HI></P>
<P>IX. After nine at Night, the <HI>Officers</HI> go the Rounds and
no Per&s;on, without very good cau&s;e, &s;uffered to be at any
Publick-Hou&s;e that is not a Lodger.</P>
<P>X. Tho this <HI>Town</HI> &s;eemed at fir&s;t, contrived for the
Purcha&s;ers of the <HI>fir&s;t hundred &s;hares,</HI> each &s;hare con&s;i&s;ting of
5000 <HI>Acres,</HI> yet few going, and that their ab&s;ence might not
Check the Improvement of the Place, and <HI>Strangers,</HI> that flockt
to us, be thereby Excluded, I added that half of the Town,
which lies on the <HI>Skulkill,</HI> that we might have Room for pre|&s;ent
and after Commers, that were not of that number, and it
hath already had great &s;ucce&s;s to the Improvement of the
Place.</P>
<P>XI. Some <HI>Ve&s;&s;els</HI> have been here Built, and many <HI>Boats;</HI>
and by that means, a ready Conveniency for Pa&s;&s;age of People
and Goods.</P>
<P>XII. Divers <HI>Brickerys</HI> going on, many Cellars already
Ston'd or Brick'd, and &s;ome Brick Hou&s;es going up.</P>
<P>XIII. The <HI>Town</HI> is well furni&s;h'd with convenient <HI>Mills;</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="3">
and what with their <HI>Garden Plats,</HI> (the lea&s;t half an Acre) the
<HI>Fi&s;h</HI> of the River, and their labour, to the <HI>Country-man,</HI> who be|gins
to pay with the provi&s;ions of his own growth, they live
Comfortably.</P>
<P>XIV. The Improvement of the place is be&s;t mea&s;ur'd, by
the <HI>advance</HI> of Value upon every mans Lot. I will venture
to &s;ay, that the wor&s;t Lot in the Town, without any Improve|ment
upon it, is worth <HI>four times</HI> more then it was when it
was lay'd out, and the be&s;t <HI>forty.</HI> And though it &s;eems un|equal
that the Ab&s;ent &s;hould be thus benefited by the Improv|ments
of tho&s;e that are upon the place, e&s;pecially, when they
have &s;erv'd no Office, run no hazard, nor as yet defray'd any
Publick charge, yet this advantage does certainly redound to
them, and whoever they are, they are great Debtors to the
Country; of which I &s;hall now &s;peak more at large.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Country Settlements.</HEAD>
<P>1. WE do &s;ettle in the way of <HI>Town&s;hips</HI> or <HI>Villages,</HI>
each of which contains 5000 Acres in &s;quare and
at lea&s;t <HI>Ten Families:</HI> The regulation of the Country, being a
Family to each five hundred Acres: Some Town&s;hips have
more, where the Intere&s;t of the People is le&s;s then that quan|tity;
which often falls out.</P>
<P>2. Many that had right to more Land, were at fir&s;t cove|tous
to have their <HI>whole</HI> quantity, without regard to this way
of &s;ettlement, tho by &s;uch <HI>Wilderne&s;s</HI> vacancies they had ruin'd
the Country, and their own intere&s;t of cour&s;e. I had in my
view, <HI>Society, A&s;&s;i&s;tance, Ea&s;y Commerce, In&s;truction of Youth,
Goverment of Peoples manners, Conveniency of Religious A&s;&s;em|bling,
Encouragement of Mechanicks, di&s;tinct and beaten Roads,</HI>
and it has an&s;wer'd in all tho&s;e re&s;pects, <HI>I</HI> think, to an
Univer&s;all Content.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="4">
<P>3. Our <HI>Town&s;hips</HI> lie &s;quare: generally the Village in the
Center; the Hou&s;es either oppo&s;it, or el&s;e oppo&s;it to the mid|dle,
betwixt two hou&s;es over the way, for nearer neighborhood.
We have another Method, that tho the Village be in the Cen|ter,
yet after a different manner: Five hundred Acres are allotted
for the Village, which among ten families comes to fifty Acres
each: This lies &s;quare, and on the out&s;ide of the &s;quare &s;tand
the Hou&s;es, with their fifty Acres running back, who&s;e ends
meeting, make the Center of the 500. Acres, as they are to
the whole. Before the Doors of tho&s;e Hou&s;es, lies the high
way, and cro&s;s it, every mans 450 Acres of Land, that makes
up his Complement of 500 &s;o that the Conveniency of Neigh|bourhood
is made agreeable with that of the Land.</P>
<P>4. I &s;aid nothing in my la&s;t of any number of Town&s;hips,
but there were at lea&s;t <HI>FIFTY</HI> &s;ettled before my leaving
tho&s;e parts, which was in the moneth call'd <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 1684.</P>
<P>5. I vi&s;itted many of them, and found them much advanc'd
in their Improvements. <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> over their heads, and <HI>Garden-Plots,
Coverts</HI> for their Cattle, an <HI>encrea&s;e</HI> of &s;tock, and &s;e|veral
Enclo&s;ures in Corn, e&s;pecially, the fir&s;t Commers; and I
may &s;ay of &s;ome Poor men, even to the beginings of an E&s;tate:
The difference of labouring for them&s;elves and for others; of
an Inheritance, and a Rack Lea&s;e, <HI>being never better under&s;tood.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of The Produce of the Earth.</HEAD>
<P>1. THe <HI>EARTH,</HI> by Gods ble&s;&s;ing, has more then
an&s;wer'd our expectation; the poore&s;t places in
our Judgment, producing large Crops of Garden Stuff, and
Grain. And though our Ground has not generally the &s;ym|ptoms
of the fat Necks, that lie upon &s;alt Waters in Provinces
&s;outhern of us, our Grain is thought to <HI>excell</HI> and our Crops to
be as large. We have had the mark of the good Ground
<PB N="7" REF="4">
among&s;t us; from <HI>Thirty to Sixty fold</HI> of Engli&s;h Corn.</P>
<P>2. The Land requires le&s;s &s;eed: <HI>Three Pecks</HI> of Wheat
&s;ow an Acre; a Bu&s;hel at mo&s;t, and &s;ome have had the in|crea&s;e
I have mention'd.</P>
<P>3. Upon Tryal, we find that the Corn and Roots that
grow in <HI>England,</HI> thrive very well there, as <HI>Wheat, Barly,
Rye, Oats, Buck-Wheat, Pea&s;e, Beans, Cabbages, Turnips, Carrets,
Par&s;nups, Colleflowers, A&s;paragus, Onions, Charlots, Garlick,
and Iri&s;h Potatos;</HI> we have al&s;o the <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and very good
<HI>RICE</HI> which do not grow here.</P>
<P>4. Our <HI>Low</HI> Lands are excellent for <HI>Rape</HI> and <HI>Hemp</HI> and
<HI>Flax.</HI> A Tryal has been made, and of the two la&s;t, there is a
Con&s;iderable quantity Dre&s;s'd Yearly.</P>
<P>5. The <HI>Weeds</HI> of our Woods feed our Cattle to the Mar|ket
as well as Dary: I have &s;een fat Bullocks brought thence to
Market before <HI>Mid-Summer.</HI> Our Swamps or Mar&s;hes yeeld
us cour&s;e Hay for the Winter,</P>
<P>6. Engli&s;h <HI>GRASS-SEED takes well;</HI> which will give us
fatting Hay in time. Of this <HI>I</HI> made an Experiment in my
own Court Yard, upon &s;and, that was dug out of my Cellar,
with &s;eed that had layn in a <HI>Cask,</HI> open to the weather two
Winters and a Summer: I caus'd it to be &s;own in the beginning
of the month called <HI>April,</HI> and a fortnight before <HI>Mid&s;ummer</HI>
it was fit to <HI>Mow:</HI> It grew very thick: But I ordered it to be
fed, being in the nature of a Gra&s;s Plott, on purpo&s;e to &s;ee if
the Roots lay firm: And though it had been meer &s;and,
ca&s;t out of the Cellar, but a Year before, the &s;eed took &s;uch
Root, and held the earth &s;o fa&s;t, and fa&s;tened it &s;elf &s;o well
in the Earth, that it held and fed like old Engli&s;h Ground.
I mention this, to confute the Objections that lie again&s;t tho&s;e
Parts, as if that, fir&s;t, Engli&s;h Gra&s;s would not grow; next,
not enough to mow; and la&s;tly, not firm enough to feed, from
the Levity of the Mould.</P>
<PB N="8" REF="5">
<P>7. All &s;orts of Engli&s;h fruits that have been tryed, <HI>take
mighty well</HI> for the time: The <HI>Peach</HI> Excellent, on &s;tanders,
and in great quantities: They &s;un-dry them, and lay them
up in lofts, as we do roots here, and &s;tew them with Meat
in Winter time. <HI>Mu&s;mellons</HI> and <HI>Water Mellons</HI> are rai&s;ed there,
with as little care as Pumpkins in <HI>England.</HI> The <HI>VINE</HI> e&s;pe|cially,
prevails, which grows every where; and upon expe|rience,
of &s;ome <HI>French People from Rochel, and the I&s;le of Rhee,
GOOD WINE</HI> may be made there, e&s;pecially, when the
Earth and Stem are fin'd and civiliz'd by culture. We hope
that good skill in our mo&s;t Southern Parts will yeild us &s;eve|ral
of the <HI>Straights</HI> Commodities, efpecially, <HI>Oyle, Dates,
Figgs, Almonds, Rai&s;ins</HI> and <HI>Currans.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the Produce of our Waters.</HEAD>
<P>1. MIghty WHALES roll upon the Coa&s;t, near the
Mouth of the Bay of <HI>Delaware.</HI> Eleven caught, and
workt into Oyl one Sea&s;on: We ju&s;tly hope a con&s;iderable
profit by a Whalery. They being &s;o numerous and the Shore
&s;o &s;uitable.</P>
<P>2. STURGEON play continually in our Rivers in
Summer: And though the way of cureing them be not gene|rally
known, yet by a Receipt I had of one <HI>Collins,</HI> that related
to the Company of the Royal Fi&s;hery, I did &s;o well pre&s;erve
&s;ome, that I had of them good there three months of the Sum|mer,
and brought &s;ome of the &s;ame &s;o for <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>3. ALLOES, as they call them in <HI>France,</HI> the Jews <HI>Allice,</HI> and
our Ignorants, <HI>Shads,</HI> are excellent Fi&s;h, and of the Bigne&s;s of
our large&s;t <HI>Carp:</HI> They are &s;o Plentiful, that Captain <HI>Smyth</HI>'s
Over&s;eer, at the <HI>Skulkil,</HI> drew 600 and odd at one Draught,
300 is no wonder, 100 familierly. They are excellent Pickled
or Smokt'd, as well as boyld fre&s;h: They are caught by nets
only.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="5">
<P>4. ROCKS are &s;omewhat rounder and larger, al&s;o a
whiter fi&s;h, little inferior in relli&s;h to our <HI>Mallet:</HI> We have
them almo&s;t in the like plenty. The&s;e are often <HI>Barrell'd like
Cod,</HI> and not much inferior for their &s;pending. Of both the&s;e
the Inhabitants increa&s;e their Winter &s;tore: The&s;e are caught
by Nets, Hooks and Speers.</P>
<P>5. The SHEEPSHEAD, &s;o called, from the re&s;em|blance
of its Mouth and No&s;e to a Sheep, is a fi&s;h much pre|ferr'd
by &s;ome, but they keep in &s;alt Water; they are like a <HI>Roach</HI>
in fa&s;hion, but as thick as a <HI>Salmon,</HI> not &s;o long. We have
al&s;o the <HI>Drum,</HI> a large and noble fi&s;h, commended equal to the
<HI>Sheepshead,</HI> not unlike to a <HI>Newfoundland Cod,</HI> but larger of
the two: Tis &s;o call'd from a noi&s;e it makes in its Belly,
when it is taken, re&s;embling a <HI>Drum.</HI> There are three &s;orts
of them, the <HI>Black, Red</HI> and <HI>Gold colour;</HI> the Black is fat in the
Spring, the Red in the Fall, and the Gold colour believed to be
the Black, grown old, becau&s;e it is ob&s;erv'd that young ones of
that colour have not been taken. They generally ketch them
by <HI>Hook</HI> and <HI>Line,</HI> as <HI>Cod</HI> are, and they &s;ave like it, where the
People are skilful. There are abundance of le&s;&s;er fi&s;h to be
caught of plea&s;ure, but they quit not co&s;t, as tho&s;e I have
mentioned, neither in Magnitude nor Number, except the
<HI>Herring,</HI> which &s;warm in &s;uch &s;hoales, that it is hardly Cre|dible;
in little Creeks, they almo&s;t &s;hovel them up in their tubs.
There is the <HI>Catfi&s;h,</HI> or <HI>Flathead, Lampry, Eale, Trout, Perch
black</HI> and <HI>white, Smelt, Sunfi&s;h,</HI> &amp;c. Al&s;o <HI>Oy&s;ters, Cockles,
Cunks, Crabs, Mu&s;sles, Mannano&s;es.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Provi&s;ion in General</HEAD>
<P>1. IT has been often &s;aid, we were &s;tarv'd for want of food;
&s;ome were apt to &s;ugge&s;t their fears, others to in&s;inuate
their prejudices, and when this was contradicted, and they
<PB N="10" REF="6" MS="y">
a&s;&s;ur'd we had plenty, both of <HI>Bread, Fi&s;h</HI> and <HI>Fle&s;h;</HI> then 'twas
objected, we were forc't to fetch it from other places at great
Charges: but neither is all this true, tho all the World will
think we mu&s;t either carry Provi&s;ion with us, or get it of the
Neighbourhood till we had gotten Hou&s;es over our heads,
and a little Land in tillage. We fetcht none, nor were we
wholly helpt by Neighbours; the <HI>Old Inhabitants</HI> &s;upplied us
with mo&s;t of the <HI>Corn</HI> we wanted, and a good &s;hare of <HI>Pork</HI>
and <HI>Beef:</HI> tis true, <HI>New-York, New-England</HI> and <HI>Road-Ifland,</HI>
did with their provi&s;ions fetch our Goods and Money, but at
&s;uch Rates, that &s;ome &s;old for almo&s;t what they gave, and
others carried their provi&s;ions back, expecting a <HI>better</HI> Mar|ket
neerer, which &s;howed no &s;carcity, and that we were not
totally de&s;titute in our own River. But if my advice be of
any Value, I would have them buy &s;till, and not weaken
their Herds, by killing up their Young Stock <HI>too &s;oon.</HI></P>
<P>2. But the right mea&s;ure of information mu&s;t be the pro|portion
of Value of Provi&s;ions there; to what they are in
more planted and mature Colonies. <HI>Beef</HI> is commonly &s;old
at the rate of <HI>two pence per Pound;</HI> and <HI>Pork</HI> for <HI>two pence half-penny;
Veal</HI> and <HI>Mutton</HI> at <HI>three pence,</HI> or <HI>three pence half penny,</HI>
that Country mony; an Engli&s;h Shilling going for <HI>fifteen pence.</HI>
Grain fells by the <HI>Bu&s;hel; Wheat</HI> at <HI>four &s;hillings; Rye,</HI> and
excellent good, at <HI>three &s;hillings; Barly two &s;hillings &s;ix pence;
Indian Corn two &s;hillings &s;ix pence, Oats two &s;hillings,</HI> in that
money &s;till, which in a new Country, where Grain is &s;o much
wanted for &s;eed, as well as food, cannot be called dear, and
e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider the Con&s;umption of the many new
Commers.</P>

if Man u&s;e but a moderate Diligence. <HI>Grapes, Mulberies, and many
wilde Fruits, and natural Plums,</HI> in abundance, this Year have I &s;een and
eat of. A brave <HI>Orchard</HI> and <HI>Nur&s;ery</HI> have I planted, and thrive mightily,
and Fruit the fir&s;t Year. I endeavor choice of Fruits, and Seeds from
many parts; al&s;o <HI>Hay-Seed;</HI> and have &s;owed a field this &s;pring for tryal.
Fir&s;t, I burn'd the leaves, then had it Grub'd, not the field, but the &s;mall

<HEAD>Advice to Adventurers how to imploy their E&s;tates,
with fair profit.</HEAD>
<P>IT is fit now, that I give &s;ome Adverti&s;ement to <HI>Adven|turers,</HI>
which way they may lay out their Money to be&s;t
advantage, &s;o as it may yeild them fair returns, and with
content to all concerned, which is the la&s;t part of my pre&s;ent
task; and I mu&s;t needs &s;ay &s;o much wanting, that it has
perhaps given &s;ome occa&s;ion to ignorance and prejudice to
run without mercy, mea&s;ure or di&s;tinction again&s;t <HI>America,</HI> of
which <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> to be &s;ure has had its &s;hare.</P>
<P>1. It is agreed on all hands, that the <HI>Poor</HI> are the <HI>Hands</HI> and
<HI>Feet</HI> of the Rich. It is their labour that improves Countries;
and to encourage them, is to promote the real benefit of the
publick. Now as there are abundance of the&s;e people in many
parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> extreamly de&s;irous of going to <HI>America;</HI> &s;o
the way of helping them thither, or when there, and the return
thereof to the Disbur&s;ers, will prove what I &s;ay to be true.</P>
<P>2. There are two &s;orts, &s;uch as are able to tran&s;port them|&s;elves
and Families, but have nothing to begin with there;
and tho&s;e that want &s;o much as to tran&s;port them&s;elves and
Families thither.</P>
<P>3. The fir&s;t of the&s;e may be entertained in this manner.
Say I have 5000 Acres, I will &s;ettle <HI>Ten Families</HI> upon them,
in way of Village, and build each an hou&s;e, an out-hou&s;e for
Cattle, furni&s;h every Family with Stock; as four <HI>Cows,</HI> two
<HI>Sows,</HI> a couple of <HI>Mares,</HI> and a yoke of <HI>Oxen,</HI> with a Town
<HI>Hor&s;e, Bull</HI> and <HI>Boar;</HI> I find them with Tools, and give
each their fir&s;t Ground-&s;eed. They &s;hall continue <HI>Seven</HI>
Year, or more, as we agree, at <HI>half encrea&s;e,</HI> being bound to
leave the Hou&s;es in repair, and a <HI>Garden</HI> and <HI>Orchard,</HI> I pay|ing
for the Trees &amp; at lea&s;t <HI>twenty Acres</HI> of Land within <HI>Fence,</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="9">
and <HI>improved</HI> to corn and gra&s;s; the charge will come to about
<HI>&s;ixty</HI> pounds Engli&s;h for each Family: At the &s;even years end,
the Improvement will be worth, as things go now, 120 l. be|&s;ides
the value of the <HI>encrea&s;e</HI> of the Stock, which may be
neer as much more, allowing for ca&s;ualties; e&s;pecially, if the
People are hone&s;t and careful, or a man be upon the &s;pot him|&s;elf,
or have an Over&s;eer &s;ometimes to in&s;pect them. The charge
in the whole is 832 l. And the value of &s;tock and improve|ments
2400 l. I think I have been mode&s;t in my computation.
The&s;e <HI>Farms</HI> are afterwards fit for <HI>Lea&s;es</HI> at <HI>full</HI> rent, or how el&s;e
the Owner &s;hall plea&s;e to di&s;po&s;e of them. Al&s;o the People
will by this time be skilled in the Country, and well pro|vided
to &s;ettle them&s;elves with &s;tock upon their own Land.</P>
<P>4. The other &s;ort of <HI>poor people</HI> may be very beneficially
tran&s;ported upon the&s;e terms: Say I have 5000 <HI>Acres</HI> I &s;hould
&s;ettle as before, I will give to each Family 100 <HI>Acres,</HI> which in
the whole makes 1000; and to each Family <HI>thirty pounds</HI>
Engli&s;h, half in hand, and half there, which in the whole comes
to 300 l. After four years are expired, in which time they may
be ea&s;ie, and in a good condition, they &s;hall each of them pay
<HI>five pounds, and &s;o yearly for ever, as a Fee-farm rent;</HI> which in
the whole comes to 50 l. a Year. Thus a man that buys 5000.
<HI>Acres</HI> may &s;ecure and &s;ettle his 4000 by the gift of one, and in
a way that hazard and intere&s;t allowed for, amounts to at lea&s;t
ten <HI>per cent.</HI> upon Land &s;ecurity, be&s;ides the value it puts upon
the re&s;t of the 5000 <HI>Acres.</HI> I propo&s;e that there be at lea&s;t <HI>two
working hands</HI> be&s;ides the <HI>wife,</HI> whether &s;on or &s;ervant; and
that they oblige what they carry; and for further &s;ecurity
bind them&s;elves as &s;ervants for &s;ome time, that they will
&s;ettle the &s;aid land accordingly, and when they are once &s;eated,
their inprovements <HI>&s;ecurity</HI> enough for the Rent.</P>
<P>5. There is yet another expedient, and that is, give to <HI>ten
Families 1000 Acres</HI> forever, at a <HI>&s;mall acknowledgement,</HI> and
<PB N="17" REF="9">
&s;ettle them in way of Village, as afore; by their &s;eating thus,
the Land taken up is &s;ecured from others, becau&s;e the <HI>method</HI>
of the Country is an&s;wered, and the value &s;uch a &s;ettlement
gives to the re&s;t re&s;erved, is not incon&s;iderable; I mean, the
40<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="2 letters"> Acres; e&s;pecially that which is <HI>Contiguous:</HI> For their
<HI>Children</HI> when grown up, and Handicrafts will &s;oon cover to
fix next them, and &s;uch after &s;ettlements to begin at an
<HI>Improved Rent in Fee, or for long Lea&s;es or &s;mall Acknowledgements,
and good Improvements,</HI> mu&s;t advance the whole con&s;iderably.
I conceive any of the&s;e methods to i&s;&s;ue in a &s;ufficient advan|tage
to Adventurers, and they all give good encouragement
to feeble and poor Families.</P>
<P>6. That which is mo&s;t advi&s;eable for People, intended thi|ther,
to carry with them, is in &s;hort, all things relating to
<HI>Apparel, Building, Houshold&s;tuf, Husbandry, Fowling,</HI> and

there will be almo&s;t a third gotten, for they go at 6 s. and by
goods well bought, at lea&s;t <HI>fifty</HI> pounds &s;terl. for every hundred

<HEAD>Of the Sea&s;ons of Going, and u&s;ual time of Pa&s;&s;age.</HEAD>
<P>1. THO Ships go hence at all times of the Year, it mu&s;t
be acknowledged, that to go &s;o as to arrive at <HI>Spring</HI>
or <HI>Fall,</HI> is be&s;t. For the Summer may be of the hotte&s;t, for

it is difficult to enter the <HI>Capes.</HI></P>
<P>2. I propo&s;e therefore, that Ships go hence about the middle
of the moneths call'd <HI>February</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> which, allowing
two moneths for pa&s;&s;age, reaches time enough to plant in

it is more healthy to be followed with Winter then Sum|mer;
tho, through the <HI>great goodne&s;s and mercy of God,</HI> we
have had an extrordinary portion of health, for &s;o new and
numerous a Colony, notwith&s;tanding we have not been &s;o

<P>4. The <HI>Pa&s;&s;age</HI> is not to be &s;et by any man; for Ships will
be quicker and &s;lower. Some have been <HI>four</HI> moneths, and
&s;ome but <HI>one,</HI> and as often. Generally between <HI>&s;ix and nine

&s;mells of a <HI>Crowd,</HI> and a <HI>clo&s;e place.</HI> Al&s;o to <HI>&s;crape</HI> often the
Cabbins, under the Beds; and either carry &s;tore of <HI>Rue</HI> and
<HI>Wormwood,</HI> &s;ome <HI>Ro&s;emary,</HI> or often &s;prinkle <HI>Vineger</HI> about
the Cabbin. <HI>Pitch</HI> burnt, is not ami&s;s &s;ometimes again&s;t faint|ne&s;s
and infectious &s;cents. I &s;peak my experience for their
benefit and direction that may need it.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e &s;ome has urged my coming back, as an argu|ment
again&s;t the place, and the probability of its improve|ment;
Adding, that I would for that rea&s;on never return: I
think fit to &s;ay, That <HI>Next Summer,</HI> God willing, I intend to
go back, and carry my Family, and the be&s;t part of my Per&s;o|nal
E&s;tate with me. And this I do, not only of Duty, but
Inclination and Choice. God will Ble&s;s and Pro&s;per poor
<HI>America.</HI></P>
<PB N="20" REF="11" MS="y">
<P>I &s;hall conclude with this further <HI>Notice,</HI> that to the end
&s;uch as are willing to embrace any of the foregoing propo&s;iti|ons
for the <HI>Improvement of Adventurers E&s;tates,</HI> may not be
di&s;couraged, from an inability to find &s;uch <HI>Land-Lords, Ten|nants,
Ma&s;ters</HI> and <HI>Servants,</HI> if they intimate their de&s;ires to
my Friend and Agent <HI>Philip Ford,</HI> living in <HI>Bow-Lane</HI> in
<HI>London,</HI> they may in all probability be well accommodated;
few of any quality or capacity, de&s;igned to the <HI>Province,</HI> that
do not inform him of their inclinations and condition.</P>
<P>Now for you that think of going thither, I have this to &s;ay,
by way of caution; if an <HI>hair</HI> of our heads falls not to the
ground, without the providence of God, Remember, <HI>your
removal</HI> is of greater moment. Wherefore have a due reve|rence
and regard to his good Providence, as becomes a Peo|ple
that profe&s;s a belief in <HI>Providence.</HI> Go clear in your &s;elves,
and of all others. Be moderate in Expectation, count on La|bour
before a Crop, and Co&s;t before Gain, for &s;uch per&s;ons will
be&s;t endure difficulties, if they come, and bear the Succe&s;s, as
well as find the Comfort that u&s;ually follow &s;uch con&s;iderate
undertakings.</P>
