<HEAD>MEROVEUS A PRINCE OF THE <HI>Blood-Royal</HI> OF FRANCE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1-57" TYPE="pages">
<P>THE Po&s;terity of <HI>Clovis</HI> the Great begun to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Throne; <HI>Clotarius</HI> the younge&s;t of his Children, remaining alone of all his Brothers to &s;ettle the ri&s;ing Monarchy of the
<PB N="2" REF="8"><HI>French,</HI> left for his Succe&s;&s;ours four Sons, who &s;hared the Crown between them. <HI>Cherebert,</HI> being the elde&s;t, had for his part the Kingdom of <HI>Paris,</HI> and its depencies. <HI>Gon|tran,</HI> that of <HI>Orleans: Chilperic,</HI> that of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons;</HI> and <HI>Sigebert</HI> that of <HI>Metz.</HI></P>
<P>Though that Union is &s;omething rare between per&s;ons of their Rank, tho&s;e four Princes lived a long time in a perfect intelligence in the Go|vernment of their States, and the tenderne&s;&s;es of Blood were ever more powerful in their hearts, than any &s;entiment of ambition and jealou&s;ie. They did not think the alliance of any neighbouring Prince, was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to them for the &s;upport of their Thrones; wherefore when they re&s;olved to leave Heirs, they &s;ought not for Women el&s;ewhere than among&s;t their Subjects, and as merit was the only thing that they con&s;idered, they applyed them|&s;elves indifferently to Per&s;ons in
<PB N="3" REF="8">whom they found mo&s;t Charms, Beauty and Wit.</P>
<P><HI>Cherebert,</HI> whom <HI>Clotarius</HI> his Father had cau&s;ed to marry <HI>Ingo|berga</HI> again&s;t his will, divorced him|&s;elf from her to take in her place <HI>Merofleda,</HI> a Merchants Daughter: <HI>Gontrand</HI> made the like choice in his States: <HI>Sigebert</HI> lived a long time without any engagement; and as for <HI>Chilperick,</HI> he marryed <HI>Andeu|era,</HI> the truth is a Maid of mean Birth, but whom Heaven had only deprived of the advantages of Blood, that the quickne&s;s of her Wit, the greatne&s;s of her Soul, and the Charms of her Beauty might be the more admired: <HI>Chilperick</HI> had by her &s;everal Children and among&s;t others a Prince called <HI>Meroveus. Cherebert</HI> after having reigned &s;ix years, dyed in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Blaye</HI> in <HI>Xaintonge:</HI> he left no male Chil|dren: In&s;omuch that the three Princes his Brothers &s;hared his King|dom between them: but as not one
<PB N="4" REF="9">of them would con&s;ent to yield <HI>Paris</HI> to an other, it was re&s;olved that City &s;hould remain neutral, that it &s;hould be equally to all three, and that not one might enter it with|out the con&s;ent of the others, upon pain of lo&s;ing the part he had in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Cherebert.</HI></P>
<P>This Affair thus regulated, tho&s;e Princes pa&s;&s;ed &s;till &s;everal years in an agreeable Society, and only made u&s;e of their Arms to repul&s;e the at|tempts of Strangers their common Enemies. But Fortune that u&s;ual|ly takes delight in de&s;troying all that is not its Work, let them only &s;o long injoy this &s;weet tranquility that their Divi&s;ion might be the more &s;en&s;ible to them.</P>
<P>Prince <HI>Meroveus</HI> was &s;eventeen years old, when one <HI>Fredegonda</HI> came into the &s;ervice of Queen <HI>An|douera. Meroveus</HI> and <HI>Fredegonda</HI> having the greate&s;t part in this Hi|&s;tory, it will not be out of the way to give a light Idea of them, that
<PB N="5" REF="9">they may be the better known.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid that <HI>Fredegonda</HI> was one of the mo&s;t capricious Works that Nature was capable of produ|cing: there was in her a confu&s;ed heap of good and ill Qualities, all of them extraordinary: but as her Virtues po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but the lea&s;t part in her Soul, they ever &s;erved only to &s;et off her Vices. That which rendered the world &s;ometimes pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in her favour, was that what &s;he had be&s;t, di&s;covered it &s;elf at fir&s;t. Tho&s;e who had once &s;een her and heard her di&s;cour&s;e, could hardly per&s;uade them&s;elves afterwards that Heaven would mingle &s;o rare Per|fections among&s;t &s;o great Defects. And it mu&s;t be avowed that &s;he knew admirable well how to &s;et off the Talents &s;he was Mi&s;tre&s;s of. Ne|ver was Beauty in all its lu&s;tre better managed and more ingeniou&s;ly im|ployed to its De&s;igns. Never did Wit with more artifice u&s;e all the graces of eloquence to per&s;uade; and
<PB N="6" REF="10">never any heart &s;o cunningly di&s;po|&s;ed the language of its &s;ighs, for the gaining the tenderne&s;s of a Prince. She thought it indifferent to follow the cour&s;e of Virtue or to &s;tray from it, and &s;he only &s;ought it when &s;he judged it might favour her enter|prizes. Ambition, Revenge, and Jealou&s;ie di&s;po&s;ed by turns of her Soul. Love was not unknown to her, but he had never &s;o great an Empire over her as to betray any of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions. The greate&s;t crimes rai&s;ed no horrour in her, &s;he re&s;ol|ved of them without pain for the &s;atisfying her de&s;ires. Fear had lit|tle place in her heart, becau&s;e that her Policy was to prevent all tho&s;e whom &s;he believed might do her hurt, and a light &s;u&s;pition was &s;uffi|cient for the &s;acrificing them to her &s;afety. Her re&s;entments could not be &s;oftned by time. Her hatred was only extingui&s;hed in the blood of the per&s;on from whom &s;he ima|gined to have received any outrage.
<PB N="7" REF="10">Deceit, di&s;&s;imulation, perfidiou&s;ne&s;s and lying, were al&s;o many Veils which concealed from the mo&s;t pe|netrating Eyes, all the foldings of her heart. In fine to give her Pi|cture with one &s;troke, it is &s;ufficient to &s;ay that &s;elf-love was the only rule &s;he thought worthy of being imbraced in the world.</P>
<P><HI>Meroveus,</HI> on the contrary, was one of the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed Princes that <HI>France</HI> had yet &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">h. It was to have been wi&s;hed that Heaven had brought him into the world in a le&s;s elevated degree; that not be|ing invironed with that dazling pomp, all his perfections might have been more nearly contemplated, and his merit judged of by it &s;elf. It was not nece&s;&s;ary to proceed to his Soul to find &s;omething in him worthy of admiration. From all the Features that Nature had printed in his Face, there re&s;ulted I know not what kind of Air which in&s;pired love and re&s;pect in all tho&s;e who
<PB N="8" REF="11">approached him. Never any Prince gave &s;o fair hopes, and in who&s;e Eyes were read greater things. At &s;o tender an age he had already &s;ig|nalized him&s;elf in Arms, and the Lawrels he had gathered in &s;everal, &amp; important, occa&s;ions, made all the world doubt if the ea&s;ine&s;s of fight|ing was not rather born with him, than formed by a long habit.</P>
<P>It &s;eemed that &s;o many fair quali|ties ought to have &s;ubdued Fortune to the happine&s;s of this Prince: Yet that cruel Enemy of Virtue made it on the contrary appear that it is in vain that Nature &s;trives to main|tain its Works, when Fortune un|dertakes to attack them: It was its will that the unfortunate <HI>Meroveus</HI> &s;hould &s;earch Po&s;terity for a famous example of its power, as well as in|ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><HI>Fredegonda</HI> had not &s;een him twice when &s;he became infinitely in love with him; and as &s;he &s;aw that this pa&s;&s;ion was but too conformable
<PB N="9" REF="11">to her ambition, &s;he wholly aban|doned her &s;elf to it with all manner of joy. She fancied that he being of an age that has little force to re|&s;i&s;t pa&s;&s;ions, and wherein a heart is ea&s;ily &s;urprized by Love when it meets with a proper object, he would hardly e&s;cape her artifices: but all her cunning and all her ad|dre&s;s was in vain: <HI>Meroveus,</HI> after having a long time avoided her &s;nares, at length &s;eeing that &s;he one day &s;pake to him openly of her love, rallied her publickly for it, and told her that to acknowledge the affecti|on &s;he had for him, he would marry her to one of his Officers.</P>
<P>The&s;e words produced in <HI>Frede|gonda</HI>'s Soul a furious vexation and an immortal hatred, which was the &s;ource of all the di&s;graces of <HI>Mero|veus,</HI> and which led him to his Grave. But as the force of this wicked Woman lay in artifices, &s;he knew &s;o well how to di&s;&s;emble in that occa&s;ion, that &s;he &s;miled at the
<PB N="10" REF="12">Princes an&s;wer, and even thanked him very civily. As &s;he knew that on the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, good or bad, that others have received from us, depend oftentimes all the judgments that are made in the &s;equel; &s;he at fir&s;t affected a conduct with <HI>Andou|era,</HI> which procured her the e&s;teem and confidence of her Mi&s;tre&s;s, and the jealou&s;ie of her Companions. All her actions were governed by a complai&s;ance full of &s;weetne&s;s, a re|&s;pectful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to all that was exacted from her, and an earne&s;tne&s;s ever new to acquit her &s;elf of the lea&s;t things her devoir engaged her to.</P>
<P>It is an u&s;ual defect in all good Souls to judg of others by them|&s;elves: as they are incapable of any di&s;gui&s;e, they fancy they &s;ee in the actions of others as much fincerity as in their own, and this imprudent goodne&s;s makes them oftentimes take for an effu&s;ion of heart, what proceeds only from an addre&s;s of Wit.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="12">
<P>The fal&s;e and deceitful appea|rances of <HI>Fredegonda,</HI> &s;o &s;urprized all the affections of <HI>Andouera,</HI> that this good Prince&s;s fancyed that &s;he could not do enough to make known to her the &s;en&s;e &s;he had of her &s;ervices. She propo&s;ed her for a model to all her other Maids of Honour, &s;he filled the Court with her prai&s;es, and the King was e&s;peci|ally dayly importuned with them; &s;o true it is that we often run pre|cipitately to our own ruine, and we become our &s;elves the contrivers of our own unhappine&s;s.</P>
<P>Though the Prince&s;s <HI>Andouera</HI> had already &s;pent more than eight|teen years in marriage, &s;he was &s;till capable of charming, and neither that long &s;pace of time, nor her Ly|ings In, which are u&s;ually the de|&s;troyers of Beauty, had worn out any thing of that &s;urprizing lu&s;tre which conquers hearts. But as de&s;ires and hopes are the only things which maintain Love, and that nothing is
<PB N="12" REF="13">more capable of making us di&s;reli&s;h an object than a long and peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. <HI>Chilperick</HI>'s pa&s;&s;ion for the Queen did nothing now but lan|gui&s;h, and tho&s;e devouring flames which the fir&s;t fight of that Prince&s;s had kindled in his Heart, were as ex|tingui&s;hed in the injoyment of her plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The reputation of <HI>Fredegonda</HI>'s Wit and Beauty gave him one day the curio&s;ity of con&s;idering and di&s;|cour&s;ing her attentively. It was in that occa&s;ion that this cunning Maid neglected nothing of all &s;he judged proper for engaging the King. She fought for Darts in her Eyes fit to di&s;cover the way to his Heart, and drain'd all the lights of her Wit to charm the Princes.</P>
<P>It was not nece&s;&s;ary to imploy &s;o much addre&s;s upon a man who ran to meet his Chains, and who longed that a new pa&s;&s;ion might renew his de&s;ires. <HI>Chilperick</HI> told <HI>Fredegonda</HI> upon his leaving her, that he was
<PB N="13" REF="13">very much &s;atisfied with her di&s;|cour&s;e, and that he would do her &s;ome kindne&s;s in a very &s;hort time. In effect, he &s;ent for her &s;ome days after by his tru&s;tie&s;t Officer, and af|ter having repeated to her the &s;ame thing, he added for the declaring to her his pa&s;&s;ion, that he had found in her more Beauty and Wit than he ought to have. de&s;ired for his re|po&s;e; that it was to Love &s;he was going to owe all the favours he &s;hould heap upon her; but as his happine&s;s depended on her, &s;he ought to contribute to it in giving him &s;en&s;ible and convincing marks of a mutual tenderne&s;s; and above all, that &s;he &s;hould carefully conceal this Gallantry from the Queen, who would not fail to be enraged at it.</P>
<P>As <HI>Fredegonda</HI> changed, as &s;he plea&s;ed, the motions of her Face, &s;he &s;eemed at that moment &s;o mode&s;t, that it helped to inflame the Kings de&s;ires. She made him know that &s;he de&s;ired nothing &s;o ardently as to
<PB N="14" REF="14">make appear to him the joy &s;he felt to &s;ee her &s;elf beloved by &s;o great a Prince; but that he was not to ex|act any thing from her that her vir|tue might di&s;allow.</P>
<P>The King was not yet &s;o blinded with his pa&s;&s;ion, but that he con&s;i|dered that it ever becomes a Woman to make &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, and not to yield &s;o &s;oon. He was not willing to pre&s;s her more that day: he con|tented him&s;elf with telling her that they would talk of it more than once, and that he would give her time to think of it. Having &s;poken the&s;e words, he took out a Table-Book with Gold-Covers &s;et with Di|amonds, which he made her a Pre|&s;ent of.</P>
<P>He had hardly left her, than that his imagination repre&s;enting her to him yet more fair than &s;he was, made him &s;en&s;ible of new returns of Love, and was extream impatient to &s;ee her again; &s;o that the next morning, while the Queen re&s;ted,
<PB N="15" REF="14">he &s;ent his Confident to tell her he de&s;ired to &s;peak with her, and &s;he immediately went to the Cabinet where he waited for her.</P>
<P><HI>Fredegonda</HI> knowing better how to dive into the hearts of others than they into hers, ea&s;ily perceived that <HI>Chilperick</HI> was too much a &s;lave to his Love, to be able ever to ma&s;ter it. Wherefore, as it was Ambition that made her act, &s;he did not amu&s;e her &s;elf to flatter his pa&s;&s;ion with frivoulous hopes, but had the bold|ne&s;s to tell him, that if he de&s;ired &s;he &s;hould an&s;wer it, he mu&s;t mar|ry her; that her birth was not in|feriour to <HI>Andouera</HI>'s; that nothing was &s;o common with all Princes, as divorce, that neither rea&s;ons nor pretext would be wanting for the furthering the de&s;ign; that this procedure towards <HI>Andouera,</HI> was not unju&s;t, that it was enough for her to have held &s;o glorious a rank near twenty years; that for her part when &s;he &s;hould as long have
<PB N="16" REF="15">&s;hared his Crown, with him, &s;he would endeavour to comfort her &s;elf if an other took her place; that in fine, he might a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf, that nothing but his Faith could obtain from her what he pretended. Af|ter the&s;e words &s;he went out of the Cabinet, and left the Prince in a mortal trouble.</P>
<P>Though it be ea&s;ie for Love to become all on a &s;udden Ma&s;ter of a Heart, and that one moment alone is &s;ufficient for it to cha&s;e away all that oppo&s;es its de&s;igns, yet it does not reign there &s;overaignly, until af|ter &s;everal &s;trifes, for the rendring its Victory the more illu&s;trious, and the more powerfully engage rea&s;on to &s;upport its intere&s;ts.</P>
<P><HI>Chilperick</HI> found his mind a long time wavering between his Devoir and his new pa&s;&s;ion: if the plea&s;ures he hoped to injoy in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Fredegonda,</HI> inclined him towards her; on the other &s;ide the Image of his Glory &s;tained by &s;o &s;hameful
<PB N="17" REF="15">a Divorce, and the innocence of <HI>Andouera</HI> were powerful curbs to &s;top the rapidity of his Vows. The great marks of Love that he had re|ceived from that good Prince&s;s, her pa&s;&s;ionate tenderne&s;s, her ardent &s;ighs, her tran&s;ports ever new, her application; cares and complai&s;ance, knocked every Moment at the Door of his Heart, to put him in mind of recovering a lawful Empire.</P>
<P>But as it is much more ea&s;ie to &s;tray from our Devoir, than to re|turn to it when we have been once out of the way, all the&s;e objects, after having for &s;ome time &s;haked <HI>Chilperick</HI>'s mind, di&s;appeared at length to let Love triumph. All that virtue could obtain from him, was that he &s;hould do what he could to per&s;uade <HI>Fredogonda,</HI> before that he re&s;olved to be divorced from <HI>An|douera.</HI> Whereupon he be&s;ieged that imperious Mi&s;tre&s;s with all manner of Arms. He joyned to the lu&s;tre of his per&s;on all the di&s;cour&s;es
<PB N="18" REF="16">of the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Lovers; and without doubt, a woman le&s;s ambi|tious than <HI>Fredegonda,</HI> would not have been able to have held out a|gain&s;t &s;o many importunities; but that haughty pa&s;&s;ion had too deep roots in her heart, to &s;uffer her to be &s;educed by other impre&s;&s;ions. She was ever deaf to the Prayers of <HI>Chil|perick,</HI> and after having a long time denyed him, and even refu&s;ed the Pre&s;ents he would have made her; She once told him very &s;harply that he was very &s;crupulous, and very fearful, not to dare to take that liber|ty to become happy, which the ex|ample of &s;o many Princes authori|zed, and which <HI>Cherebert</HI> his Bro|ther had him&s;elf practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>There is no injury which &s;o &s;en&s;i|bly touches Kings, as the reproach of fear: as boldne&s;s is the fir&s;t mark of courage, they imagine for the bet|ter, making appear the greatne&s;s of their Souls, they ought to give their power its full &s;cope, in&s;omuch that
<PB N="19" REF="16">what moves them to unlawful acti|ons, is oftentimes only a vain glory of making known that they are capable of undertaking all things. <HI>Frede|gonda</HI>'s words had &s;o much force up|on <HI>Chilperick</HI>'s heart, that they part|ly determined him intirely to marry her. His pride repre&s;ented to him, that to make the impre&s;&s;ion in the mind of that Maid, and of all his People, of a &s;trong Idea of his inde|pendence, he ought not to defer his Divorce from <HI>Andouera;</HI> and Love applauding the &s;entiments of his pride, per&s;uaded him that he ought no longer to ballance the e&s;tabli&s;h|ing his happine&s;s, &s;ince it would on|ly co&s;t him one crime, which the mo&s;t natural of all pa&s;&s;ions had ever rendered excu&s;able. He told his Mi&s;tre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> that he very well fore&s;aw, that he mu&s;t con&s;ent to what &s;he de|&s;ired, and that he would quickly make her &s;ee, that it was not a mo|tion of fear that had made him re|&s;i&s;t &s;o long.</P>
<PB N="20" REF="17">
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e &s;o puft up <HI>Frede|gonda</HI>'s vanity, that &s;he began from that moment to fancy her &s;elf Crowned, and to act like a Sove|raign with all people. The Queen who was not long without percei|ving it, was the mo&s;t of all concer|ned at this Change. As &s;he had ne|ver found any thing but &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and re&s;pect in <HI>Fredegonda,</HI> the im|perious Air with which &s;he &s;pake to her, could not enough &s;urprize her. She &s;everal times made her gentle remon&s;trances, and &s;eeing it was to no purpo&s;e, &s;he one day pro|ceeded to threatnings.</P>
<P><HI>Fredegonda,</HI> being no longer de|tained by any confideration, an&s;wer|ed her &s;harply, and left the Cham|ber, telling her, that &s;he had no longer right to u&s;e tho&s;e terms, that her time was pa&s;&s;ed, and that others was going to begin. The&s;e words were clear enough to explain to the Queen, <HI>Chilperick</HI>'s new engage|ment; but being &s;till blinded by her
<PB N="21" REF="17">ea&s;ine&s;s, they only plunged her into a great di&s;quiet.</P>
<P>As &s;he was in the&s;e agitations, <HI>Meroveus,</HI> her Son, came to her A|partment, to make known to her the fir&s;t news of her Di&s;grace. <HI>Me|roveus</HI> having a penetrating Wit had a long time perceived <HI>Fredegonda</HI>'s De&s;igns; but being he had ever be|lieved, that the King would have no le&s;s power than he, to re&s;i&s;t her ar|tifices, he had not thought fit to a|larm the Queen with the recital of a thing of little con&s;equence, and wherein he did not fore&s;ee, that the Glory and Love of that Prince&s;s were to be one day equally interre&s;|&s;ed.</P>
<P>An Officer of the Kings Bed-Chamber, deploring the approach|ing misfortune of <HI>Andouera,</HI> having given notice to the Prince of what pa&s;&s;ed, <HI>Meroveus</HI> believed it nece&s;|&s;ary to acquaint the Queen &s;udden|ly with it, that &s;he might joyn with him to avoid the &s;torm that was go|ing
<PB N="22" REF="18">to powder upon her. The poor Prince&s;s having learn'd <HI>Meroveus</HI> fa|tal di&s;cour&s;e, fell into a &s;woon in his arms, and it was to little purpo&s;e, that the Prince remained pious in this Rencounter, and that he left her not in that oppre&s;&s;ion, being, when &s;he came to her &s;elf, &s;he was the more &s;en&s;ible of her misfortune, and delivered her mind up to the mo&s;t cruel attacks of Grief.</P>
<P>They re&s;olved to go find the King out immediately, and to remon&s;trate to him the di&s;orders this unhappy pa&s;&s;ion would produce, if he re&s;ol|ved to &s;atisfie it at the expence of his Glory. Approaching the Kings A|partment they perceived at a di|&s;tance through the Gla&s;s Windows <HI>Fredegonda</HI> holding a Table-Book in her hands.</P>
<P>After having &s;tole &s;oftly to the Window, <HI>Andouera</HI> perceived it was the Kings Table-Book, in which he ever &s;et down his mo&s;t &s;ecret De|&s;igns.</P>
<PB N="23" REF="18">
<P>At this &s;ight the Queen was &s;eiz|ed with a lively re&s;entment; &s;he commanded <HI>Fredegonda</HI> to open to her the Door, which &s;he refu&s;ed to do, threatning &s;he would complain to the King if any violence was done her.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;olent words increa&s;ed the Queens vexation; and <HI>Mero|veus</HI> being tran&s;ported with anger, having broken the Windows, leap'd furiou&s;lly into the Cabinet, &s;natch'd the Table-Book out of <HI>Fredegonda</HI>'s hands, and went to the Queen, who returned with him, to her Chamber to examine it. After having turned over &s;everal Leaves without finding any thing, &s;he read in one place the&s;e Ver&s;es written by <HI>Chilperick</HI>'s one hand, and which he had com|po&s;ed in the beginning of his pa&s;&s;i|on for <HI>Fredegonda:</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="19">
<Q><L>Love only plea&s;es for a time,</L>
<L>At length we're weary of its Chain.</L>
<L>Virtue the mo&s;t &s;evere, &s;ublime,</L>
<L>From a new choice can't oft re&s;train.</L></Q></P>
<P>And below the&s;e Ver&s;es, <HI>Andou|era</HI> found the&s;e of <HI>Fredegonda</HI>'s hand writing.
<Q><L>When we have charm'd a great and mighty King,</L>
<L>Mu&s;t we have nothing but his pant|ting Heart?</L>
<L>His Empire ought to be our Offering,</L>
<L>E're we do ea&s;e his fiery raging &s;mart;</L>
<L>Yes, yes, ambition is the brighte&s;t Flame,</L>
<L>What Woman wants it, is I'me &s;ure to blame.</L></Q></P>
<P>What became of her after having read the&s;e &s;tabbing words? It was then that this deplorable Prince&s;s took a full view of her misfortunes,
<PB N="25" REF="19">and that &s;he no longer doubted that <HI>Chilperick</HI> was charmed with <HI>Frede|gonda,</HI> but even that this wicked Maid had already much &s;haken his Virtue, to engage him to marry her. She run as di&s;tracted, accompanied by <HI>Meroveus,</HI> to the Kings Apart|ment. When they came to his Chamber Door, the Guards refu&s;ed to let them in, and told them they had Orders not to let any one &s;o|ever enter without acquainting the King.</P>
<P>After having learn'd that they were there, he came to them contra|ry to his cu&s;tom. <HI>Andouera,</HI> at the &s;ight of <HI>Chilperick,</HI> let fall a torrent of Tears; all the Graces painted at that time, in her Face, an eloquent Grief, capable of moving the mo&s;t barbarous heart; and without doubt <HI>Chilperick's</HI> would not have been in|&s;en&s;ible, if he had not been full of <HI>Fredegonda</HI>'s Charms, whom he had newly quitted.</P>
<P>The Queen with a langui&s;hing
<PB N="26" REF="20">Voice, and which was every moment interrupted by her &s;ighs, told the King, that the love &s;he bore him, rather than her own intere&s;ts, engaged her to make known to him how &s;hame|fully he was going to &s;tain his Glory by the irregularity of his Pa&s;&s;ion. She pray'd him to con&s;ider what could be the nature of the affection that <HI>Fredegonda</HI> had for his Per&s;on, and to judg of it by the Ver&s;es &s;he had made upon that &s;ubject. Having &s;poken the&s;e words, &s;he pre&s;ented the Table-Book to the King.</P>
<P>That Object filled his Soul with &s;pite and confu&s;ion, and made him fall into furious motions of choler again&s;t the Queen. He did not per|mit her to &s;peak any more; but in|terrupting her, he told her angrily, that he could never have believed, &s;he would have been &s;o bold as to have done violence to per&s;ons whom he honoured with his affection, even to force from them, the Te&s;timonies he had been willing to give them
<PB N="27" REF="20">thereof; that &s;he as well as <HI>Mero|veus</HI> &s;hould pay dear for this affront. That as for his pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Fredegon|da,</HI> if &s;he found it was &s;o great a crime, it was for her her&s;elf to expiate it, &s;ince &s;he had been the principal cau&s;e; that he &s;hould never have conceived the lea&s;t de&s;ire of &s;peaking to that Maid, if &s;he had not dayly &s;tun'd him with her prai&s;es; that it was her great importunity alone that had &s;tirred up her curio&s;ity; that her dayly di&s;cour&s;es repeated in fa|vour of her Rival, had made him in&s;en&s;ibly love her before he had con&s;idered her; in fine, that &s;he had no body to blame but her &s;elf for her misfortune, &s;ince &s;he had woven with her own hands the Bonds which were going to break theirs.</P>
<P>This outraging reproach pierced the very Soul of poor <HI>Andouera:</HI> all the words it contained were &s;o much the more &s;en&s;ible to her, for that they were true, and that &s;he acknow|ledged &s;he had been the fatal in&s;tru|ment
<PB N="28" REF="21">of her own ruine. The ex|ce&s;s of grief did not leave her force enough to &s;peak: but her eyes and &s;ighs declared all the ju&s;t indignati|on with which &s;he was &s;eized. <HI>Me|roveus</HI> was not &s;o moderate as &s;he, or rather his re&s;entment was not ca|pable to deprive him of the u&s;e of his voice; he told the King that &s;ince he was re&s;olved to pu&s;h things to that extremity, he &s;aw him&s;elf con&s;trained to be once wanting in the re&s;pect that he owed him as his Son and his Subject, for the prevent|ing a di&s;order that was going to fall upon all the Royal Family.</P>
<P>This menace inflamed <HI>Chilperick</HI>'s anger; he cau&s;ed the Queen and <HI>Meroveus</HI> to be &s;eized, commanded they &s;hould be &s;hut up apart, and cau&s;ed Guards to be &s;et at their Chamber doors, with expre&s;s order to let no body enter. After which he returned to the Cabinet where <HI>Fredegonda</HI> expected him. She at fir&s;t affected a fal&s;e pity for <HI>Andouera,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="21">and told <HI>Chilperick</HI> that it was a|gain&s;t her will that &s;he cau&s;ed &s;o much di&s;order in the Court; but &s;ince it was for the better &s;etling the happine&s;s of her King, &s;he did not repent it: but that it was con|venient and even nece&s;&s;ary, &s;udden|ly to make an end of the Work, and to remove the Queen while that people's minds were already prepa|red for that rupture.</P>
<P>The too ea&s;ie <HI>Chilperick,</HI> be&s;otted with his pa&s;&s;ion, con&s;ented to all <HI>Fredegonda</HI>'s propo&s;itions, and would not follow any other rule than her will. He agreed with her to &s;end the Queen to the City of <HI>Mans.</HI> After having ha&s;tily made her a &s;mall Equipage, he cau&s;ed her to depart at two days end, without &s;uffering her to bid him farewel, nor even to &s;peak with <HI>Meroveus.</HI> That innocent and deplorable Prin|ce&s;s went thus from <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> and ap|peared as a wretched Victim, that her love for an unfaithful Man was
<PB N="30" REF="22">going to con&s;ume by little and little. So long as &s;he could perceive the Walls of that City, &s;he eyed it, &amp; &s;ent it continually her &s;ighs. But as &s;oon as &s;he was out of &s;ight, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed over in her thoughts all that had pa&s;&s;ed at Court: &s;he re-called into her memory, all the Graces and Favours &s;he had &s;o often &s;o prodigally be|&s;towed upon her Rival, and for which &s;he had not expected &s;o fatal a recompence: but that which in|crea&s;ed her pain was, that &s;he was not allowed at her departure to em|brace the Prince her Son, whom &s;he cheri&s;hed with a tenderne&s;s worthy of her.</P>
<P>When &s;he arrived at <HI>Mans,</HI> though that Fame had already car|ryed thither the news of her Di&s;|grace, all the City was in Arms to receive her, and did her all the ho|nours that they owed, not only to their true Queen, but as to a Per|&s;on who had ever reigned more &s;o|veraignly over all their minds by
<PB N="31" REF="22">her Virtues, than by the Title &s;he had born.</P>
<P><HI>Meroveus</HI> having learn'd his Mo|thers removal, conceived a mortal hatred again&s;t <HI>Fredegonda,</HI> and re|&s;olved to be revenged on her, let what would come on it: but his impri&s;onment not permitting him to attempt the execution of his Pro|jects, he was con&s;trained to &s;tifle them. The King not being willing to keep always from the Eyes of the Court, a Prince upon whom all the people founded their greate&s;t hopes, bethought him&s;elf of an artifice to &s;et him at liberty: but he put him in &s;uch a po&s;ture, as not to appre|hend any thing he could do again&s;t <HI>Fredegonda:</HI> He made known to <HI>Meroveus,</HI> that if he made any at|tempt upon her, he would immedi|ately revenge him&s;elf on the Prince&s;s his Mother, and that the lea&s;t Me|nace that &s;hould e&s;cape from him, &s;hould be the &s;entence of <HI>Andouera's</HI>'s Death. It was upon the&s;e har&s;h
<PB N="32" REF="23">Conditions that the Prince was let out of Pri&s;on. The &s;ight of his E|nemy did every moment increa&s;e his hatred, and he would not have been able to have forborn the abandoning him&s;elf to &s;ome violence, if the Queens intere&s;t had not ever retain|ed him.</P>
<P>In the mean time the pomp of the Kings Marriage with <HI>Fredegonda</HI> was preparing. This ambitious Wo|man triumphing in her &s;elf, floated then in joy, and imagined her &s;elf already at the point of Soveraignty. But fortune which delights in &s;elling her Favours dear, &s;till exacted from her great Crimes, before it mounted her upon the Throne.</P>
<P>The <HI>Huns,</HI> who placed all their glory in making Cour&s;es and Inva|&s;ions upon their Neighbours, took a re&s;olution of &s;eizing <HI>Au&s;tra&s;ia.</HI> To that end they marched out of <HI>Pan|nonia,</HI> and came with powerful Troops to attack King <HI>Sigebert,</HI> who prepared to repul&s;e them courage|ou&s;ly:
<PB N="33" REF="23">But at the &s;ame time there happened to him other Affairs which con&s;trained him to treat of Peace with the <HI>Huns,</HI> not very ad|vantageous to him, and &s;uch as his great courage would not have &s;uf|fered in another conjuncture.</P>
<P><HI>Fredegonda</HI> who&s;e ambition in|crea&s;ed, and &s;eeing no more ob&s;tacles to hinder her from reigning with <HI>Chilperick,</HI> carryed her de&s;ires much farther, and believed &s;he ought not to let &s;o fair an occa&s;ion &s;lip, of en|larging the bounds of an Empire &s;he fancied already belonged to her. She remon&s;trated to <HI>Chilperick,</HI> that while the King of <HI>Au&s;tra&s;ia</HI> was bu|&s;ied in defending him&s;elf again&s;t the <HI>Huns,</HI> it would be ea&s;ie for him to invade his Territories, that he ought not to be retained by any vain &s;cruple, and to &s;top at weak con&s;ide|rations of Friend&s;hip and tenderne&s;s; that nothing was &s;o glorious as the Title of Conquerour; In fine, that it was great to be in a po&s;ture of gi|ving
<PB N="34" REF="24">Law to others, and of making Subjects, even upon the Throne.</P>
<P>It was Ambition that dictated this di&s;cour&s;e to <HI>Fredegonda,</HI> but &s;he had likewi&s;e other very powerful con&s;iderations to move her to it. As Policy was the principal re&s;ort that &s;et her mind agoing, her pa&s;|&s;ion for a Scepter, did not hinder her from fore-&s;eeing that her Marriage would not fail to di&s;plea&s;e the Princes her Brothers, and upon their per&s;ua&s;ion he would &s;ooner or later be obliged to be divorced from her; In&s;omuch that &s;he had already for &s;ome time &s;ought means fit for the breaking the Union that was be|tween them when this was pre&s;ent|ed. She did not at all doubt but that <HI>Gontran</HI> King of <HI>Orleans,</HI> who loved Peace and Ju&s;tice, would ardently imbrace <HI>Sigebert</HI>'s Party, when be came to know the equity of his Cau&s;e; and thus &s;he judged that the &s;ucce&s;s of this War, let it be what it would, mu&s;t needs be advantage|ous to her.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="24">
<P><HI>Chilperick,</HI> who did nothing but by <HI>Fredegonda,</HI> li&s;tened to her, took Fire, and his Love making u&s;e of a &s;entiment of Ambition, for the con|cealing from him the ba&s;e and &s;er|vile complai&s;ance he had for a Wo|man, he re&s;olved with her to attack <HI>Sigebert,</HI> in hopes of &s;uddenly con|quering his Territories. Whereup|on he rai&s;ed Forces &s;ecretly, and marched him&s;elf at their Head, ac|companied by <HI>Meroveus,</HI> towards <HI>Au&s;tra&s;ia,</HI> after having left the ad|mini&s;tration of all Affairs to <HI>Frede|gonda.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Meroveus</HI> went not to this Expe|dition without regret, becau&s;e he naturally hated Inju&s;tice: and he al&s;o made appear, he only fought for Peace, and did but &s;hew his cou|rage for the preparing the two Kings to a Reconciliation. The Army came in a few days to the Walls of <HI>Rheims,</HI> which after having main|tained &s;ome A&s;&s;aults, was at length con&s;trained to open its Gates, and
<PB N="36" REF="25">&s;uffer the victorious Enemy to come in.</P>
<P><HI>Sigebert</HI> was acquainted &s;ome days after with this &s;ad News, and was obliged, as we have already &s;aid, to make Peace with the <HI>Huns.</HI> He &s;ent immediately to <HI>Gontran,</HI> to give him notice of this &s;urprize, and to de|&s;ire his Aid to defend him&s;elf again&s;t <HI>Chilperick</HI>'s Treachery. He likewi&s;e &s;ent to demand Succours of <HI>Athana|gildus,</HI> King of the <HI>Goths</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> to whom he had formerly given the like again&s;t <HI>Agila,</HI> King of the <HI>Vi&s;i|goths. Athanagildus,</HI> in whom &s;er|vices made a great impre&s;&s;ion, did not &s;tick to acknowledge tho&s;e that <HI>Sigebert</HI> had done him, and was willing to go &s;uccour him in per|&s;on: After having &s;etled his Af|fairs, and tru&s;ted the Conduct of them in Per&s;ons he judged the mo&s;t capable, as it was a very u&s;ual thing to the Kings of that time, to carry with them their Wives and Chil|dren, he marched out of his Terri|tories,
<PB N="37" REF="25">with a very powerful Army, accompanied with the Queen, and the two Prince&s;&s;es his Daughters.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Sigebert</HI> return|ed towards <HI>Rheims,</HI> in all ha&s;te, of which he became Ma&s;ter in a few days: <HI>Chilperick,</HI> who was gone from thence, having left in it but a weak Garri&s;on. The King of <HI>Au|&s;tra&s;ia</HI> was not contented with ha|ving recovered that place; it was his turn, he thought, to make &s;ome attempts upon his Enemies Territo|ries. He went and attacqued him in <HI>Fi&s;mes,</HI> where he then was for the appea&s;ing &s;ome Sedition that was rai&s;ed there; he pre&s;&s;ed him &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that <HI>Chilperick</HI> quickly &s;aw him&s;elf in a condition of im|ploring his Clemency, rather than irritating his valour: Wherefore he had recour&s;e to <HI>Gontran,</HI> to &s;often him in his Favour. <HI>Gontran</HI> was arrived a little time before in <HI>Sige|bert</HI>'s Camp: as Peace and Union were the only things he breathed,
<PB N="38" REF="26">he favourably heard the per&s;ons <HI>Chil|perick</HI> &s;ent him, and made &s;uch in|&s;tances to <HI>Sigebert,</HI> that he obliged him to compo&s;e with his Brother, and to that effect to make a &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion of Arms. There was an Inter|view of the&s;e three Princes, and through <HI>Gontran's</HI> interce&s;&s;ion, the Peace was at length concluded, and publi&s;hed. The truth is, it was &s;omething a &s;hameful one for <HI>Chilpe|rick;</HI> but &s;uch as he merited.</P>
<P>In the mean time <HI>Athanagildus</HI> approaching nearer and nearer, ha|ving learn'd this reconciliation, di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed the be&s;t part of his Troops, but upon the Princes de&s;ire he ad|vanced towards them with his Fa|mily. They &s;ent the Principal Lords of their Court to meet him, and received him in the Palace with great marks of e&s;teem and af|fection. <HI>Sigebert,</HI> above all, particu|larly thanked him for the part he had taken in his Intere&s;ts. There were &s;everal gallant Fea&s;ts made, of
<PB N="39" REF="26">which <HI>Brunchaut</HI> and <HI>Gal&s;uinta</HI> were ever the greate&s;t Ornaments. Sports, Shows and Treats reigned then in all their lu&s;tre, and never did any Court, compo&s;ed of &s;o many Kings, appear &s;o neat and &s;o magnificent.</P>
<P>While that &s;o &s;weet a Calm en|chanted all their minds, and that they all &s;trove to di&s;&s;ipate, in &s;o in|nocent Diverti&s;ements, the troubles and alarms of War; Love, being willing to contribute to the happi|ne&s;s of tho&s;e Princes, fancied that &s;o tranquil plea&s;ures were not touching enough, and that for the augmenting their force, he ought to mingle with them &s;ome of his trou|ble. <HI>Sigebert</HI>'s indifference had al|ways appeared to him injurious to his Glory, in&s;omuch that he re&s;olved to revenge him&s;elf in that occa&s;ion, but he would make him at the &s;ame time find that that liberty that an in&s;en&s;ible heart does &s;ometimes va|lue it &s;elf for, is but an imaginary good, and that it is nece&s;&s;ary to feel

His pa&s;&s;ion was too fair, and his Vows too well placed to di&s;&s;emble them. After having a&s;&s;ured him&s;elf of <HI>Brunchauts</HI> heart, who according to the cu&s;tom of young Women only &s;ighed for a Throne, he &s;pake thereof to <HI>Athana|gildus.</HI></P>

<P>As all the&s;e Princes were willing to return, each one to his State, the preparations for this Nuptial pomp were made with all &s;peed, but it was not the le&s;s &s;plendid; and it appear'd that tho&s;e who had had the managing of it, had fore&s;een at fir&s;t, that on one and the &s;ame day would be made a double Fea&s;t.</P>

<P><HI>Chilperick</HI> being of a &s;oft and fear|ful nature, dur&s;t not re&s;i&s;t the Princes propo&s;itions; he con&s;ented they &s;hould agree the Affair with the King of the <HI>Goths,</HI> and promi&s;ed to ratifie all they &s;hould do.</P>

<P><HI>Athanagildus</HI> was over-joyed with this &s;econd Alliance; but a &s;cruple troubled him in favour of his Daughter, and he could not defend him&s;elf again&s;t the alarms that <HI>Chil|perick</HI>'s love for <HI>Fredegonda</HI> gave him: In&s;omuch that this Prince was obliged to &s;wear upon the Altars, that <HI>Gal&s;uinta</HI> &s;hould be hence-forward the only object of his pa&s;&s;ion, and that he would wholly &s;tifle the tenderne&s;s he had had for his favourite: a frivolous Oath, which he quickly fancied Love might di&s;pence him from.</P>
<P>In the mean time, <HI>Meroveus,</HI> in the mid&s;t of &s;o much publick rejoy|cing, had his Soul alone delivered up to grief and &s;adne&s;s.

<P>The&s;e Nuptials being celebrated with all manner of magnificence, they all returned towards their States. <HI>Athanagildus</HI> went towards <HI>Spain; Gontran</HI> towards <HI>Orleans;

<P>It mu&s;t be avowed that Love is &s;omething very capricious, that this fierce Tyrant of Souls is extream jealous of his Power and his Rights.</P>
<P><HI>Gal&s;uinta</HI> had &s;o lively and touch|ing a Beauty, that no body could &s;upport the lu&s;tre of it without a|mazement; and to give a perfect Idea of her, it is &s;ufficient to &s;ay that &s;he was an exact portraict of her Si&s;ter <HI>Brunchaut.</HI> But though all the Graces &s;hould have transformed them&s;elves into her, though Nature &s;hould have drained it &s;elf in forming her, <HI>Chilperick</HI> had married her with|out con&s;ulting Love, and this was enough to make him conceive for her &s;entiments of contempt and a|ver&s;ion.

In the mid&s;t of his Court, he &s;eemed to be in a va&s;t &s;olitude,

And it mu&s;t likewi&s;e be avowed, that no|thing has ever equalled the vexati|on of that ambitious Woman, and that as &s;oon as &s;he had received the news of this Marriage, &s;he abandoned her &s;elf to all the &s;entiments of rage and de&s;pair that a woman can be ca|pable of.</P>
<P>Some days before <HI>Chilperick</HI>'s ar|rival, &s;he pretended to be &s;ick, that

<P>As &s;oon as &s;he perceived the King and that &s;he had ob&s;erved in his Eves and his Face, the Empire &s;he had &s;till over his heart, &s;he prevented him, and told him that &s;he fore&s;aw, that the Di&s;ea&s;e &s;he laboured under would carry her to her Grave; but that &s;he &s;hould enter it with joy, &s;ince
<PB N="50" REF="32">&s;he was precipitated into it by the exce&s;s of her love: that however &s;he &s;hould have dyed more content|ed, if her virtue had permitted her to have given him more &s;en&s;ible marks of her pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Nothing is more &s;urprizing to a Lover, than to hear kind things, and flatteries, from his Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es mouth, when he expected nothing but re|proaches and threatnings, neither is there any thing more capable of ma|king him dete&s;t his infidelity, and in|&s;pire him with more love.</P>
<P>This flattering and artificious di&s;|cour&s;e of <HI>Fredegonda,</HI> &s;o moved <HI>Chil|perick,</HI> that all the powers of his Soul remained a long time in di&s;or|der. He had &s;o little force left, that he had recour&s;e to his &s;ighs, and e|ven to &s;ome tears, for the explain|ing to his Mi&s;tre&s;s the de&s;pair her illne&s;s reduced him to. Striving at length to &s;peak to her, he begged of her not to renounce life, and &s;wore to her, that if &s;he would promi&s;e
<PB N="51" REF="32">him to take care of it, he would put her, notwith&s;tanding the pre&s;ent conjuncture, in a &s;tate in a &s;hort time of reconciling her glory with her Love. He was not willing to &s;tay any longer with her that day, le&s;t all his Court &s;hould know he was &s;till in love.</P>
<P><HI>Fredegonda</HI> then recovered firm hopes of mounting upon the Throne, and as the reputation of <HI>Gal&s;uinta</HI>'s Beauty and Merit, made her appre|hend the King might become in&s;en|&s;ibly charmed, &s;he re&s;olved to di&s;|patch that Prince&s;s as &s;oon as po&s;&s;i|bly &s;he could. But becau&s;e &s;he would be pre&s;ent her &s;elf, at that fatal execution, for the making it the more &s;ure, &s;he was obliged to wait &s;ometime, for fear her &s;ickne&s;s &s;hould be di&s;covered to have been feigned, if &s;he quitted her Bed all of a &s;udden. In the Vi&s;its that the King dayly made her, &s;he a&s;&s;ured him that &s;he grew better and better, and that the obliging words he had

<P>In fine, the certainty of her reco|very being &s;pread through all the Palace, after having prepared her &s;elf for that horrible Sacrifice, &s;he went one day to make the Queen a Vi&s;it; and cho&s;e the time that &s;he was only attended by two of her Maids of Honour.

<PB N="53" REF="33">that the Rack and remor&s;e might make that Wretch tell what moved him to &s;o dete&s;table a Parricide; &s;o true it is, that great Ones, who make u&s;e of other men to execute their pernicious De&s;igns, often re|&s;olve at the &s;ame time to &s;acrifice them al&s;o to them&s;elves, that the death of the&s;e blind Mini&s;ters may &s;erve for a Vail and Cloud to their De&s;igns.</P>
<P>The noi&s;e of this Tragical Death being &s;pread through all the Palace, the King run to &s;ee this pitiful Spe|ctacle.

<PB N="54" REF="34">their greate&s;t lu&s;tre, before they clo|&s;ed for ever, objects &s;o tender and &s;o touching, excited in his heart a &s;trong pity, and a ju&s;t re&s;ent|ment again&s;t the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate.</P>
<P><HI>Fredegonda</HI> would make him know that &s;he was no le&s;s &s;en&s;ible than he for this misfortune; &s;he e|ven &s;hed Tears, but it was rather for joy than grief. Yet as there is no|thing more natural than to let our &s;elves be per&s;uaded by tho&s;e we love, <HI>Chilperick</HI> fancyed &s;he was innocent, and that &s;he had not had any part in the murder.</P>
<P>A Tomb was erected for the Prin|ce&s;s, and <HI>Fredegonda</HI> to take away all &s;u&s;picion was careful it &s;hould be the mo&s;t glorious of all tho&s;e that had yet appeared. She affected at <HI>Gal|&s;uinta</HI>'s Funeral, all the regrets that are u&s;ual to per&s;ons really afflicted. But the clear-&s;ighted did not fail to di&s;cover, through this di&s;gui&s;e, that it was &s;he who had cau&s;ed her death; and her Marriage with the King,

<P>In the mean time <HI>Fredegonda</HI> ap|prehending that <HI>Sigebert,</HI> doubting of the truth, would revenge the Death of his Si&s;ter in Law, in&s;tead of <HI>Athanagildus,</HI> whom a Feaver had lately taken out of this World; wherefore &s;he bethought her &s;elf of preventing him. And thereupon remon&s;trated to the King that it was of the utmo&s;t importance to make reflexion upon the con&s;equences that <HI>Gal&s;uinta</HI>'s death might have
<PB N="56" REF="35">that the malignity of Men made them often treat as criminal the mo&s;t innocent actions upon the lea&s;t ap|pearances; that &s;he already fore&s;aw that her Marriage would e&s;tabli&s;h in ba&s;e minds, a firm belief, that &s;he had cau&s;ed that attempt; that the&s;e fal&s;e reports making a &s;trong impre&s;|&s;ion on the minds of <HI>Sigebert</HI> and his Mini&s;ters, he would not fail to form the De&s;ign of attacquing him; that the remembrance of their pa&s;t dif|ferences would be a powerful Spur to excite his vengeance; In fine, that it was policy and prudence to prevent him and not to &s;tay till he came and over-run their Territories with a powerful Army.</P>
<P><HI>Chilperick</HI> who&s;e blind pa&s;&s;ion had made him forget the misfortune that <HI>Fredegonda</HI>'s councels had plunged him into, did not ballance to follow her &s;entiments: He cau&s;ed his Coun|cil to a&s;&s;emble, but it was only to keep a vain formality.

<P>The preparations of this War be|ing made, <HI>Fredegonda</HI> was willing to go to it in per&s;on, for the anima|ting the Kings courage; and to hin|der him from making any Peace with his Brother; She prayed him to leave <HI>Meroveus</HI> at <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons.

The &s;ight of <HI>Meroveus</HI> cau&s;ed in her in|credible tran&s;ports and exta&s;ies. She made them appear by her Tears and her Sighs, that were the fir&s;t di&s;|cour&s;es that &s;he held with him. Af|ter having entertained them&s;elves with their misfortunes, and of what they had to do, they were to part. As <HI>Fredegonda</HI> had the Title of Queen, <HI>Andouera</HI> thought it unbe|coming her Virtue to di&s;patch her by cunning and ba&s;e means. She did not believe that all the Crimes of that wicked Woman, could au|thori&s;e an action that &s;hould have any re&s;emblance with hers. Where|fore &s;he propo&s;ed to the Prince to go &s;ee <HI>Brunchaut</HI> for to confer with her, and to engage, by her means, the greate&s;t Men of <HI>Au&s;tra&s;ia,</HI> to de|mand <HI>Fredegonda</HI> of <HI>Chilperick,</HI> to &s;acrifice her to their King, and upon his refu&s;al, &s;hould make War upon
<PB N="66" REF="41">him, who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s would be per|haps more happy than it had been.</P>
<P><HI>Meroveus</HI> con&s;ented with joy to this propo&s;ition, and took leave of the Prince&s;s. It &s;eem'd at their part|ing, that <HI>Andouera</HI> had a &s;ecret pre|&s;age of her Son's misfortune: a great &s;hivering went through all her Body, her fancy was filled with fa|tal objects, and her tears were dryed up, as too weak to expre&s;s the vio|lence of her grief, &s;he embraced the Prince &s;everal times, and felt her &s;elf fixed to him by &s;omething more &s;trong and more extraordinary than the tenderne&s;&s;es of Blood. In fine, <HI>Meroveus</HI> having forced him&s;elf from her Arms, as again&s;t her Will, he immediately left <HI>Mans</HI> to go in all &s;peed to <HI>Roan.</HI></P>
<P>It was there that Love and For|tune expected this young Prince, to make him &s;en&s;ible of all that they have mo&s;t cruel, and to perfect his ruine, which they had con&s;pired to|gether.</P>
<PB N="67" REF="41">
<P>In all the way he felt him&s;elf agi|tated with an unknown trouble, and which he could not attribute to any of the pa&s;&s;ions he had felt.

By a very capri|cious effect two contrary motions led him on and &s;topped him at the &s;ame time. In fine, that &s;ecret timi|dity &s;uffering him to do his Devoir, he entred the Prince&s;&s;es Chamber, whom he found plunged into a deep melancholy.</P>
<P>Of all the Darts of Love, there are none who&s;e &s;troaks we receive with le&s;s re&s;i&s;tance than tho&s;e which i&s;&s;ue from the misfortunes of the per&s;on we are to love. The affection of a fair one is &s;o touching a Charm to a ge|nerous heart, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;|&s;ible
<PB N="68" REF="42">for it to intere&s;s it &s;elf in her Fate, by the &s;ole &s;entiments of pity. The Soul &s;oftned by &s;o &s;ad an object, ea&s;ily forgets it &s;elf to con&s;ider it on|ly: its de&s;ires are &s;tirred up, its powers are in motion, and in the mid&s;t of this di&s;order I know not what kind of langui&s;hing, mingled with grief and di&s;plea&s;ure together, penetrates all its foldings.</P>
<P>If it was a happine&s;s for <HI>Brunchaut</HI> to be beloved by <HI>Meroveus,</HI> it may be &s;aid the &s;tate &s;he was then redu|ced to, was the greate&s;t favour &s;he had received from Fortune. Her Eyes through Rivers of Tears which run ince&s;&s;antly, &s;ent fearful and lan|gui&s;hing looks to the Prince, which immediately found an ea&s;ie pa&s;&s;age to his very heart: The palene&s;s and alteration of her Face did not hin|der the admiring &s;till tho&s;e &s;ecret Graces, which procured her as many Adorers, as there were per&s;ons who approached her. It even &s;eemed that Love for the better &s;ecuring his

<P><HI>Meroveus</HI> was a long time mute before her, and only an&s;wered her Tears with his Sighs. <HI>Brunchaut</HI> took his &s;adne&s;s and &s;ilence for an ill augure. She fancyed that he came to execute &s;ome fatal &s;entence that <HI>Chilperick,</HI> or rather <HI>Fredegonda,</HI> had pronounced again&s;t her; that the &s;ight and Idea of her mi&s;eries touch|ed the young Prince: but that his genero&s;ity and compa&s;&s;ion, would not be cap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 span"> of over-coming the obedience he owed the King his Fa|ther; in&s;omuch that &s;he thought of nothing el&s;e than of preparing her &s;elf for Death. After having &s;trove to &s;top for &s;ome moments the cour&s;e of her Tears, &s;he told the Prince, &s;ighing, that among&s;t all the ills &s;he had fore&s;een, &s;he had never expect|ed from the utmo&s;t rigour of For|tune, what it was going to act a|gain&s;t her; that &s;he perceived her fatal hour was come; that &s;he had
<PB N="70" REF="43">courage enough not to murmur at it, and to go without regret to find out her Husband in the Grave: But that &s;he could not &s;uffer without complaining, that a Prince whom &s;he had ever e&s;teemed for his Virtue, &s;hould have charged him&s;elf with the care of her Death; that &s;he was but too well a&s;&s;ured of it, by tho&s;e marks even of pity that he gave her, and that he made it enough known by his &s;ilence that it was all that he could grant her.</P>
<P>This reproach quite oppre&s;s'd <HI>Me|roveus,</HI> it put him entirely out of a condition of explaining his &s;enti|ments to <HI>Brunchaut:</HI> Nothing but his Eyes had been able to have di&s;|covered &s;omething to her, if &s;he had well con&s;ulted them. The new trouble &s;he ob&s;erved in his Face con|firmed her in the errour &s;he was in. She per&s;uaded her &s;elf that the per|plexity &s;he &s;aw this Prince in, was a tacite confe&s;&s;ion of all &s;he had &s;aid to him; when &s;he made a &s;trong re|flection
<PB N="71" REF="43">upon her misfortunes, the ex|ce&s;s of her grief made her fall into a &s;woon. Her Maids who retired out of re&s;pect, run all in at the noi&s;e they heard, and brought her to her &s;elf again.</P>
<P><HI>Meroveus</HI> received the fir&s;t glan|ces of her Eyes half open. His &s;ighs then permitting him to break a &s;ilence, that had been &s;o injurious to her, he told the Prince&s;s that &s;he was very cruel and unju&s;t to have &s;uch low thoughts of him; that no de&s;ign was formed again&s;t her, that the de&s;ire only of &s;eeing her had brought him to <HI>Roan:</HI> But though that <HI>Chilperick</HI> and <HI>Fredegonda</HI> &s;hould have con&s;pired her ruine, he would not ballance to embrace her defence again&s;t them; that he was not only animated to it by his Glory and his Virtue, that he found him&s;elf tyed to her by Bonds much more power|ful than tho&s;e of Nature, that &s;he ought not to attribute to his pity a|lone, the fatal e&s;tate her &s;ight had
<PB N="72" REF="44">reduced him to; that nothing but &s;o &s;trong a pa&s;&s;ion as Love was ca|pable of producing &s;o &s;trange effects; that he was re&s;olved to procure her her liberty, even at the peril of his Life; that he would not force her heart to any acknowledgment for his Services; but that if without doing violence to her inclinations &s;he could &s;uffer his Vows, he prayed her to favour them, and con&s;ent to the happine&s;s of a Prince who might one day make her reign upon the chiefe&s;t Throne of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Brunchaut</HI> was &s;o &s;urprized with &s;o unexpected a di&s;cour&s;e, that the exce&s;s of joy made almo&s;t in her the &s;ame effect that grief had done. Af|ter having remained a long time mute, &s;he an&s;wered the Prince that &s;he &s;hould be very credulous to add faith to his words, the pre&s;ent jun|cture of affairs little permitting them to think of &s;uch a de&s;ign; but that if he would give her real marks of his Love, he ought to endeavour her
<PB N="73" REF="44">liberty, as he had newly promi&s;ed her; that they might afterwards ad|vi&s;e more at lei&s;ure, of what would be convenient for them to do, for both their repo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Meroveus</HI> too much re&s;pected the Prince&s;&s;es will to contradict it: he even &s;tole away from the plea|&s;ures, that he &s;hould have reli&s;hed in a longer conver&s;ation, to run and give her marks of his obedience and his zeal. He &s;ent for the Go|vernour of the Ca&s;tle the Prince&s;s was in, and told him that he de&s;ired &s;he &s;hould go out and be at liberty, that he would be re&s;pon&s;ible, the King &s;hould not take it ill, and that he would charge him&s;elf with his Conduct. This Officer too much re&s;pected his Kings elde&s;t Son, not to con&s;ent to what he demanded, he pre&s;ented him with the Keys of the Ca&s;tle, and told him that he might u&s;e them as he &s;hould think fit.</P>
<P>A reflexion which came into <HI>Me|us</HI>'s
<PB N="74" REF="45">mind, hindered him from re|turning then to the Prince&s;s. Never had any fair pa&s;&s;ion in a great heart been &s;o violent in &s;o little a time as this was. It &s;eemed as if Love had only &s;pared him till then for the making him feel at once all the tran&s;ports that can agitate a Lover, during &s;everal years. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of <HI>Brunchaut</HI> appeared to him &s;o perfect a happine&s;s, that it is not to be wondred, if he thought more of &s;ecuring that than any thing el&s;e. By a motion of di&s;tru&s;t, very u&s;ual to Lovers, he apprehended that the Prince&s;s once relea&s;ed out of Pri&s;on, would immediately vani&s;h out of his &s;ight; wherefore he fancyed that he ought, before all things, em|ploy all his efforts to get her con&s;ent to their Marriage.</P>
<P>Whereupon he went to &s;ee her the next day: The &s;ight of her did not cau&s;e in him any new encrea&s;e of Love, his pa&s;&s;ion being uncapa|ble of receiving any. He told her
<PB N="75" REF="45">he had found the Captain of the Guards inflexible to his Prayers; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">hat that Officer dur&s;t not di&s;po&s;e of any thing without expre&s;s Or|ders from Court; but upon his ha|ving a&s;&s;ured him, that he would publickly marry the Prince&s;s as &s;oon as ever &s;he was &s;et free, he had made known to him he would favour his De&s;ign; that &s;he could not then recover her liberty but at that rate; that, &s;ince time pre&s;&s;ed, &s;he ought to declare her &s;elf with the &s;oone&s;t, and to examine her &s;elf if it was not more advantageous for her to enter into Sacred Bonds with a Prince, who would make it eternally all his happine&s;s to plea&s;e her, than to langui&s;h &s;adly in an ob|&s;cure Pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Though <HI>Meroveus</HI> &s;hould have dived into all the mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts of <HI>Brunchaut,</HI> he could not more agreeably have flattered her de&s;ires. She had made &s;everal re|flexions upon the fir&s;t vi&s;it of this
<PB N="76" REF="46">Prince. As &s;he had apprehended his Love was only a pa&s;&s;ing flame, which would be the more ea&s;ily extingui&s;hed, in that it had appear|ed at fir&s;t with too much violence, &s;he was di&s;plea&s;ed with her &s;elf that &s;he had not made better u&s;e of the occa&s;ion, for the deeper en|gaging him, and that &s;he had too exactly ob&s;erved &s;crupulous decen|cies out of &s;ea&s;on. She had con&s;idered that &s;he could not find a firmer &s;up|port again&s;t the hatred of <HI>Fredegonda,</HI> her mortal Enemy; that even <HI>Chilpe|rick</HI> could not di&s;pence him&s;elf from protecting her, when he &s;aw her his Sons Wife; that her glory was intere&s;&s;ed in this Alliance, &s;ince it was the highe&s;t Rank &s;he could then a&s;pire to. Neither was this young Prince &s;o indifferent to her, but that Love made her give him the ten|dere&s;t of her Vows. Wherefore &s;he told him that &s;ince &s;he &s;aw her &s;elf forced to open to him all her heart, liberty was not the greate&s;t
<PB N="77" REF="46">good &s;he de&s;ired; that &s;he &s;hould even con&s;ider it as the wor&s;t of ills, if it only &s;erved to ab&s;ent her from a per&s;on who could alone make her good or ill Fortune; that &s;he had been no le&s;s troubled at the &s;ight of the Prince, than he had been at hers; that in fine, the &s;ighs of two hearts were never &s;o well met.</P>
<P><HI>Meroveus,</HI> whom this di&s;cour&s;e put into an exta&s;ie, interrupted it, to make known to the Prince&s;s the tran&s;ports of his joy, by all the terms that Love can put into the mouth of the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate Lo|vers. After which he told her &s;he mu&s;t ha&s;ten &s;o longed for mo|ments, and endeavour without cea|&s;ing the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their mu|tual happine&s;s; that he was go|ing to the Archbi&s;hop, <HI>Pretextat,</HI> his God-father, to obtain from him the Di&s;pen&s;ation that was nece&s;&s;ary for them; that he did not believe he would refu&s;e it him, having al|ready
<PB N="78" REF="47">received from that Prelate, in other rencounters, &s;everal marks of a particular affection.</P>
<P>After the&s;e words he left her, and run to <HI>Pretextat</HI>'s hou&s;e, to whom he communicated his De&s;igns, praying him to bring no ob&s;tacle to them.</P>
<P>The Prelate &s;trangely &s;urprized with &s;uch a piece of News, remon|&s;trated to the young Prince, that he better ought to command his pa&s;&s;ion and moderate his de&s;ires; that what he demanded of him could not be done; that it would cau&s;e too great a &s;candal in the world; and that it would likewi&s;e expo&s;e them both to the Kings re|&s;entment.</P>
<P>This cruel refu&s;al reduced this poor Lover to de&s;pair: he begged and threatned by turns, but his prayers and his threatnings were equally in vain, and <HI>Pretextat,</HI> to avoid the ill effects they might pro|duce, left him angrily, and run to

Gai|lan</HI> was a man of a ripe and &s;etled judgment, who rather deplored the blindne&s;s of his Ma&s;ter than inclined to flatter his pa&s;&s;ion. He told him that he ought not to act with &s;o much precipitation, in an Affair of that importance; that he ought to fore&s;ee the ills he would bring upon him&s;elf; that <HI>Fredegonda</HI> had already but too much imbittered the King again&s;t him, without gi|ving him &s;till &s;o ju&s;t a &s;ubject of complaint.</P>
<P><HI>Meroveus,</HI> who&s;e anger was in|flamed at &s;o free a di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ilenced
<PB N="80" REF="48">his Confident with furious threat|nings. He told him, that if he o|pened his heart to him, it was to learn what way he &s;hould take to arrive at the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of what he loved, and not to know what con|&s;equences his Love might have; that he had fore&s;een them as well as him&s;elf, but that they allarmed him but little, that he &s;hould e&s;teem him&s;elf too happy, let what would happen, if he once &s;aw him&s;elf <HI>Brunchauts</HI> Husband; that, in fine, he forbid him upon pain of Life, ne|ver to make him the like remon|&s;trances.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ion of this unfortunate Prince proceeded to &s;uch an exce&s;s, that his great Soul, which had ever been capable of embracing &s;o many things at once, was then wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with it, it remained in a kind of in&s;en&s;ibility for all other objects, and it was not known if it was &s;till &s;u&s;ceptible of rea&s;on but in entertaining <HI>Brunchaut. Gailan</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="48">perceiving that this Lover was not in a condition to reli&s;h any mode|rate coun&s;el, fancied that the mo&s;t u&s;eful &s;ervice that he could do him, was to facilitate to him the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;ince if he came to mi&s;s of her, it was to be feared his de&s;pair might carry him to attempt &s;omething again&s;t him&s;elf. After having asked him pardon for the boldne&s;s his zeal had made him take, he told him that the &s;ure&s;t means to move <HI>Pre|textat,</HI> was not to u&s;e rigour and threatnings; that he ought on the contrary renew more and more to him his prayers and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, and make known to him that if he &s;hew|ed him&s;elf inexorable, it would in|fallibly co&s;t the Princes Life, that he only &s;aw two objects capable of giving him repo&s;e, his Marriage with <HI>Brunchaut,</HI> or Death.</P>

<P><HI>Meroveus</HI> whom the fear of the greate&s;t dangers, nor even death before his Eyes, had ever been a|ble to make him &s;toop to his Ene|mies, embraces <HI>Gailan,</HI> and does him&s;elf beg his excu&s;e for his pa&s;|&s;ion. He returned immediately to <HI>Pretextat</HI>'s hou&s;e, to whom he &s;ent up word, that he be&s;eeched him to hear him yet once more, and that he needed not to apprehend any thing from him.</P>
<P>The Prelate loving this young Prince, was not in&s;en&s;ible to his misfortune. He was willing to give him the &s;atisfaction he de|manded, and expo&s;e him&s;elf once more to his &s;ight. He came to him, and ob&s;erving in his Face a a little more tranquility than before, he asked him if he begun to be cu|red of his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Meroveus</HI> viewing him with lan|gui&s;hing Eyes, replyed, that <HI>Brun|chaut</HI> reigned too &s;overaignly in his
<PB N="83" REF="49">heart, to believe he could ever re|nounce her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; that this &s;erenity which appeared in his Face, was rather a mark of his de&s;pair, than of the tranquility of his Soul; that before he abandoned him&s;elf entirely to it, he returned to im|plore his goodne&s;s; that <HI>Pretextat</HI> had his Life and his Fate in his hands, that as &s;oon as he &s;hould have a&s;&s;ured him that he ought not to pretend to the marriage of the Prince&s;s, he would run to Death.</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e uttered with an action wholly pa&s;&s;ionate, &s;o moved <HI>Pretextat,</HI> that he could hardly for|bear &s;hedding tears. He begged the Prince to believe that he &s;ha|red in his grief, and that it was not without regret that he found him&s;elf unable to grant what he de|&s;ired.</P>
<P>At the&s;e fatal words, <HI>Meroveus,</HI> &s;eized-with a blind fury, drew his Sword, and would have run him|&s;elf

<P><HI>Pretextat,</HI> who really found by this action, that it concerned the Princes Life to marry him to <HI>Brun|chaut,</HI> told him, to re-a&s;&s;ure him, that &s;ince he &s;aw this Marriage was &s;o important to him, he would not re&s;i&s;t it any longer; that how|ever as he would not do any thing again&s;t his con&s;cience, and which might di&s;plea&s;e the Holy See, he was willing to con&s;ult fir&s;t the mo&s;t under&s;tanding Divines of <HI>Roan,</HI> and that within three days at the farthe&s;t he would give him a po&s;i|tive an&s;wer.</P>
<P>But <HI>Meroveus,</HI> who, be&s;ides the impatience of his Love, feared with rea&s;on &s;ome ob&s;tacle on <HI>Chilpe|rick</HI>'s and <HI>Fredegonda</HI>'s part, was not &s;atisfied with the&s;e promi&s;es. He would not go from <HI>Pretextat</HI>'s hou&s;e till he had a&s;&s;ured him he would go that moment to con&s;ult &s;uch per&s;ons as were fit to clear his doubt.</P>

<P>In effect this Prelate lo&s;t not a|ny time: He cau&s;ed &s;everal Do|ctors to a&s;&s;emble in all ha&s;te, they all told him it was their opinion, he might celebrate the Princes Mar|riage without wounding his con|&s;cience.</P>
<P><HI>Pretextat</HI> after having &s;ettled all on Gods &s;ide, was likewi&s;e wil|ling to keep peace with the King as well as he could, or at lea&s;t to procure him&s;elf Defenders again&s;t his re&s;entment.

<P>Decency having at length part|ed the&s;e two Lovers, <HI>Meroveus</HI> re|turned home to pa&s;s the re&s;t of the night. It was then that this Prince felt more than ever in his Soul tho&s;e unea&s;ie de&s;ires, tho&s;e lively ea|gerne&s;&s;es, tho&s;e impatient tran&s;|ports, tho&s;e &s;weet agitations ever blooming; In fine, all that an a|mourous heart can be &s;en&s;ible of, when itisi &s;uddenly to po&s;&s;e&s;s what it loves.</P>
<P>That &s;o longed for hour being come, he returned to the Prince&s;&s;es Hou&s;e, whom he told that it was time &s;he &s;hould go out of Pri&s;on, and that &s;he ought no longer to wear any other Chains than tho&s;e of Love.</P>
<P><HI>Brunchaut,</HI> being willing to make the Empire &s;he had over <HI>Merove us,</HI> to further her De&s;igns, viewed him with a &s;ad Eye, and which made it
<PB N="89" REF="52">apparent that there was &s;omething wanting to her Vows.</P>
<P>The Prince much &s;tartled, pre&s;|&s;ed her to explain the &s;ubject of her grief. Whereupon &s;he made all the per&s;ons retire who were in the Chamber, and told that Lover that &s;ince he had left her, &s;he had made a &s;erious reflexion upon the im|portant Affair &s;he was going to engage her &s;elf in; that a &s;econd Marriage &s;o precipitated would in &s;ome manner wound her Glory; that this might make &s;everal be|lieve that &s;he had been of intelli|gence with <HI>Sigebert</HI>'s Murderers; that &s;he fancyed to have heard the Voice of that Husband, who cryed Vengeance to her, and reproach|ed her with her weakne&s;s and ingra|titude.</P>
<P>This Lover, to whom all the&s;e Words were as &s;o many Darts
<PB N="90" REF="53">piercing his Soul, interrupted the Prince&s;s, crying, that if &s;he was &s;o cruel as &s;olely to oppo&s;e his hap|pine&s;s, by con&s;iderations meerly frivolous and chimerical, he would give him&s;elf, in her &s;ight, marks of his de&s;pair.</P>
<P><HI>Brunchaut,</HI> having prayed the Prince to hear her yet one moment, added to what &s;he had told him, that &s;he was too far ingaged to give back, and though &s;he could con&s;ent to it, &s;he found that &s;he had not force enough over her &s;elf, to hinder her from following the in|clination of her heart; but that it was nece&s;&s;ary that an illu&s;trious re|venge &s;hould ju&s;tifie her carriage, and &s;hould per&s;uade all people that &s;he would not have returned &s;o &s;oon to the Laws of Marriage, but for the better performing what &s;he owed to <HI>Sigebert</HI>'s Manes; that in fine, Victimes were required, and
<PB N="91" REF="53">that before they went to the Al|tar, &s;he exacted a faithful promi&s;e from him, that he would deliver to her &s;uch as &s;he thought her due.</P>
<P><HI>Meroveus</HI> an&s;wered <HI>Brunchaut,</HI> that her Will &s;hould be eternally the only Rule of his Actions, be|cau&s;e that he knew very well that in following them, he &s;hould only follow what Glory would in&s;pire him with, whereupon putting a Fence to the ground, he took one of the Prince&s;&s;es hands, and &s;wore he would &s;acrifice to her &s;uch Vi|ctims as &s;he &s;hould think fit, pro|vided &s;he always excepted the King his Father.</P>
<P>She told him that &s;he only aimed at <HI>Fredegonda</HI> and her Creatures: In&s;omuch that the&s;e Lovers did ea&s;ily reconcile all their &s;entiments. They went from the Ca&s;tle to the
<PB N="92" REF="54">Great Church where the Prelate ex|pected them. Never was Nuptial Pomp prepared with &s;o much ha&s;te, but one may &s;ay that it was more charming than all that Art or Luxu|ry had yet &s;hewn, &s;ince Love ap|peared in triumph there in its great|e&s;t lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>The crowd of people which run to &s;ee &s;o fine a Sight, was &s;o great, that the Souldiers could hardly make a free pa&s;&s;age for the Chariot that carryed the&s;e Lovers; and the joy was &s;o generally &s;pread in all hearts, that all places ecchoed the Vows every one &s;ent to Heaven for their pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>That holy Ceremony being fini&s;h|ed, the Prelate would treat the new marryed; he invited them to a Fea&s;t that he had cau&s;ed to be prepared, with as much neatne&s;s and magnificence, as &s;o &s;hort a time
<PB N="93" REF="54">could permit. Several of the chief|e&s;t per&s;ons of the City were like|wi&s;e of the Fea&s;t. They &s;trove with a kind of emulation to com|pliment this Royal Pair, and to te&s;tifie, e&s;pecially to <HI>Brunchaut,</HI> the extream di&s;plea&s;ure they had had in &s;eeing her &s;o unju&s;tly langui&s;h in a hard Captivity. The Beauty of this Prince&s;s was then in its greate&s;t &s;plendour; it &s;eemed as if all the Graces were met in her; and there i&s;&s;ued from her Eyes and her Face, I know not what lu&s;tre, that had never been ob&s;erved be|fore, and wherein haughtine&s;s and &s;weetne&s;s made together an agree|able mixture.</P>
<P><HI>Meroveus</HI> fixed all his looks up|on her, and could not be &s;atisfied with contemplating her; the more he &s;aw her, the more new Charms did he di&s;cover; and though he had already formed a &s;trong Idea
<PB N="94" REF="55">of them, he avowed in him&s;elf that the pre&s;ence of &s;o rare an object effaced all that his imagination had repre&s;ented to him in her ab&s;ence. He waited with an extream impa|tience for the end of that day, which ought to be the beginning of his happine&s;s, when that illu|&s;trious company was told that <HI>Chil|perick</HI> and <HI>Fredegonda</HI> were entred the City, followed by a Body of Hor&s;e, and that &s;everal Squadrons were perceived at a di&s;tance coming on.</P>
<P><HI>Meroveus,</HI> as &s;truck with Thun|der at that fatal News, remained a long time without motion. When he had recovered his Spirits, he did not doubt but that the King, animated by <HI>Fredegonda,</HI> would force the Hou&s;e in which they were, and that his Mother-in-Law would u&s;e all her efforts to ruine <HI>Brunchaut.</HI> So that to pre&s;erve a
<PB N="95" REF="55">Life that was much more dear to him than his own, he obliged the Prince&s;s to fly immediately away with him. The&s;e two poor Lovers run to take refuge in the &s;ame Church, and at the Feet of the &s;ame Altars where they had newly entred into &s;o holy Bonds.</P>
<P><HI>Chilperick,</HI> notwith&s;tanding all that <HI>Fredegonda</HI> could &s;ay to him, dur&s;t not draw them out by force; he was &s;till &s;o much the Ma&s;ter of his re&s;entment, as not to violate the Sacred A&s;ile of all the unhap|py. He &s;ent word to tho&s;e Lovers that they might come out with all &s;afety, that being far from doing them any violence, he would rati|fie this Marriage, provided the Church con&s;ented to it. How cre|dulous is Love, and how ea&s;ily does it fall into the Snares that are laid for it? <HI>Brunchaut</HI> having &s;till pru|dence enough to fore&s;ee what
<PB N="96" REF="56">would happen, remon&s;trated to <HI>Me|roveus,</HI> that they ought not to re|lye on &s;o &s;u&s;pected and deceitful promi&s;es, and that <HI>Fredegonda</HI>'s &s;trength lay ordinarily in Treache|ries and Artifices.</P>
<P>But this Lover, whom his pa&s;&s;i|on rendred no longer capable of any reflexion, told the Prince&s;s that this di&s;tru&s;t would only help to ir|ritate the King, who&s;e &s;ight they could not long avoid; that he hoped Nature would be &s;till &s;o &s;trong in his Heart, as to overcome his re&s;entment.</P>
<P>The too ea&s;ie Prince&s;s yielded to the Prayers and Per&s;ua&s;ions of <HI>Me|roveus.</HI> They both went to deli|ver them&s;elves as unhappy Vi|ctims into the hands of their Ene|mies.</P>
<P>When they appeared before <HI>Chil|perick,</HI>
<PB N="97" REF="56">it was to no purpo&s;e their Tears &s;poke and rai&s;ed the pity of all the People. This barbarous King, in&s;pired by his Wife, cau&s;ed them in&s;tantly to be &s;hut up in the Ca&s;tle, but each in a Chamber a|part; In&s;omuch that the unfortu|nate <HI>Brunchaut</HI> &s;eemed to have breathed only &s;ome moments of li|berty, to be afterwards the more lively &s;en&s;ible of the rigours of her Pri&s;on. The&s;e Lovers were treat|ed with &s;o much indignity, as that they were even refu&s;ed the per&s;ons who&s;e &s;ervice was nece&s;&s;ary to them. They were deprived of the con&s;o|lation they might have had in com|municating their thoughts, and in learning what was re&s;olved of a|gain&s;t them; In fine, &s;uch as were obliged to come into their Cham|bers, to carry them the nece&s;&s;aries of Life, were forbidden to &s;peak to them, and they had no other en|tertainment than their Complaints.</P>
<PB N="98" REF="57">
<P>In the mean time <HI>Chilperick</HI> cau|&s;ed <HI>Pretextat</HI> to be &s;eized, whom he accu&s;ed of High Trea&s;on.

They remon&s;trated to him, in &s;ecret, that this ob&s;tinacy to defend him&s;elf would but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> more irritate the King, who would have him owe his &s;afety to hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> Clemency, and that as &s;oon as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould &s;ee in him the marks of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Subject, he would cea&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> to trouble him.</P>

<PB N="99" REF="57">to the A&s;&s;embly, he confe&s;&s;ed before <HI>Chilperick</HI> the Crimes with which he was charged, and made him&s;elf, by this imprudent avowal, the Sentence of his Condemnation. For the&s;e words were hardly e&s;caped from him, than that the King demand|ed High Ju&s;tice of the Prelates, and &s;aid that the accu&s;ed ought to be judged upon his Depo&s;ition. Whereupon this innocent Wretch was immediately degraded, and ba|ni&s;hed to a little De&s;art I&s;land, near the City of <HI>Coutance,</HI> from whence af|ter a long Bondage he was at length re-called, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in his Dignity. But <HI>Fredegonda</HI> not knowing what it was to forget an injury, cau|&s;ed him to be at la&s;t a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, e|ven as he was celebrating Divine Service.</P>
<P>That wicked Woman made u&s;e of all her Addre&s;&s;es and Power with the King, to oblige him to put <HI>Brun|chaut</HI>
<PB N="100" REF="58">and <HI>Meroveus</HI> to death. As &s;he &s;aw that Nature was not yet whol|ly extingui&s;hed in <HI>Chilperick</HI>'s heart, and that it did not permit him to &s;hed &s;o unju&s;tly his own Blood, &s;he only demanded that of <HI>Brunchaut:</HI> But her hatred was deceived, and her Victime e&s;caped from her when &s;he lea&s;t mi&s;tru&s;ted it.</P>
<P>The Lords of <HI>Au&s;tra&s;ia,</HI> who yet knew nothing of what had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ent Deputies to <HI>Chilperick</HI> to re|demand of him their Queen, and re|mon&s;trate to him that they could not &s;uffer &s;he &s;hould be detained longer from them, without any rea&s;on; and that they were rea|dy to implore Succours of all the neighbouring Princes, to procure &s;atisfaction in this point. The Affair being &s;eriou&s;ly treated of in the Kings Council, this Demand was found &s;o ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, that, notwith&s;tanding all that <HI>Fre|degonda</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="58">could &s;ay, it was re&s;olved that <HI>Brunchaut</HI> &s;hould return unto her Territories, and &s;hould depart with the Amba&s;&s;adours. Where|upon &s;he was relea&s;ed out of Pri|&s;on, and <HI>Meroveus</HI> likewi&s;e out of his at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P><HI>Fredegonda,</HI> in whom this de|parture cau&s;ed tran&s;ports of rage and de&s;pair, did all that &s;he could to moderate them by an imperfect vengeance, &s;ince that &s;he could not entirely exerci&s;e it. As it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to find any com|fort, but in the unhappine&s;s of the&s;e Lovers, &s;he ordered they &s;hould be relea&s;ed together out of the Ca&s;tle; and that they &s;hould &s;ee one another once more; this cruel plea&s;ure &s;he only granted them that they might be the more lively &s;en&s;ible of their fatal &s;eparation, and that they might have the Idea of it the more pre&s;ent.</P>
<PB N="102" REF="59">
<P><HI>Meroveus</HI> fixing his looks upon the Prince&s;s, met with hers, which for the la&s;t time &s;ought the Princes heart, to explain to it her Love and her Grief.

<P><HI>Brunchaut</HI> at length di&s;appearing from the Eyes of <HI>Meroveus,</HI> he was &s;hut up in a Cloy&s;ter, where, by a <HI>Capricio</HI> as fanta&s;tical as un|ju&s;t, the King cau&s;ed him to be &s;haved, and engaged him in the Or|ders again&s;t his Will, believing thereby to deprive him of all means of ever intriguing in the World. A &s;trange and pernicious Policy of Men! who abu&s;e Religion e|ven for the execution of their Crimes, and make u&s;e of the mo&s;t Sacred My&s;teries, as ea&s;ie In&s;tru|ments for their bringing to pa&s;s their unju&s;t enterprizes.</P>
<PB N="103" REF="59">
<P><HI>Chilperick,</HI> after having &s;ent <HI>Brun|chaut</HI> away, returned to <HI>Paris,</HI> with <HI>Fredegonda,</HI> and left his Son to di|ge&s;t at lei&s;ure his vexations in his &s;olitude.</P>
<P>It was then that the heart of this Prince was wracked by allarms much more cruel than all tho&s;e with which he had been yet &s;ei|zed, and that he found him&s;elf agitated with all the other pa&s;&s;ions that are the u&s;ual effects of an un|happy Love. When he thought how treacherou&s;ly Fortune had dealt with him, that he con&s;idered that it had only brought him near his happine&s;s, to make his lo&s;s of it the more &s;en&s;ible, he fell under his Grief. That charming Image of the Prince&s;&s;es Beauty that was &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed in his heart, and which ince&s;&s;antly offered it &s;elf to his Eyes, did only help to encrea&s;e his ills, and augment his regrets.
<PB N="80" REF="60">But his main trouble was the un|certainty he was in of <HI>Brunchaut</HI>'s Fate, and was in a mortal fear that <HI>Fredegonda</HI> had cau&s;ed her to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated upon the Way. He could not conceive this Idea with|out de&s;pair, and it was however what hindred him from attempting any thing him&s;elf, becau&s;e he would not abandon his Life, without be|ing a&s;&s;ured of that of the Prince&s;s. It was to no purpo&s;e he inquired News of her, all People were deaf to his Prayers, and the continual Favours that <HI>Fredegonda</HI> be&s;tow|ed upon that Hou&s;e, &s;topped the mouths of all the Religious. He likewi&s;e tryed all manner of ways to e&s;cape from that place; but his endeavours were &s;till fruitle&s;s, till that his Enemy her &s;elf facilitated to him the execution of this De&s;ign to compleat his ruine.</P>
<P><HI>Fredegonda</HI> had lately brought
<PB N="81" REF="60">forth a Son to <HI>Chilperick,</HI> whom &s;he de&s;igned for the Throne, and fore-&s;eeing that <HI>Meroveus,</HI> after the Kings Death, might return from his Vows with &s;o much the more ea&s;e, in that his heart had e|ver di&s;avowed them, &s;he fancyed that nothing but this Princes Death could &s;ecure the Crown to her Son: Wherefore &s;he re&s;olved of it, let what would happen. Of all the Creatures &s;he had made, the mo&s;t powerful was <HI>Bozon,</HI> Lieute|nant-General of <HI>Sigebert's</HI> Armies. This man &s;ince the Death of that Prince had ever remained at <HI>Sige|bert</HI>'s Court, who con&s;idered him upon <HI>Fredegonda</HI>'s recommendati|on. She one day told this Favou|rite, that &s;he mu&s;t exact an impor|tant Service from him, and that &s;he would fully acknowledge it. <HI>Bozon</HI> a&s;&s;ured her that he was rea|dy to undertake all things for her. Whereupon &s;he communicated to
<PB N="106" REF="61">him her De&s;ign of di&s;patching <HI>Me|roveus,</HI> and propo&s;ed to him the proper means for that end: He ap|proved them, and they re&s;olved to ca&s;t &s;o horrid a Crime upon <HI>Gailan</HI> the Princes Confident, and to per|plex him in this Affair.</P>
<P><HI>Bozon</HI> went privately away from Court, taking &s;uch per&s;ons with him as he had an ab&s;olute power over. He went to find out <HI>Gailan,</HI> to whom he &s;aid he was re&s;olved to attempt <HI>Meroveus</HI>'s Liberty, who&s;e misfortune he deplored, that he had &s;everal Friends in the Hou&s;e he was in; that he hoped to oblige the Religious to leave him to him, and that he would then conduct him into <HI>Au&s;tra|&s;ia,</HI> where the Queen his Wife would be &s;ure to receive him with joy.</P>
<P><HI>Gailan</HI>'s Affection for his Ma|&s;ter
<PB N="107" REF="61">was too great to refu&s;e &s;o fair a Propo&s;ition. He encoura|ged <HI>Bozon</HI> to &s;o fair and generous an enterprize, and a&s;&s;ured him that if he was happy enough to bring it to pa&s;s, the Prince would not be ungrateful. They went to|gether to the place where he was, and <HI>Bozon</HI> made <HI>Gailan</HI> to expect him at the Door.</P>
<P><HI>Bozon,</HI> &s;eeing the Prince, told him that the re&s;entment that he had of the ills that his Enemies made him &s;uffer &s;o unju&s;tly, had brought him to that place, where, by the means of Prayers and Pro|mi&s;es, he was &s;uffered to come to him.</P>
<P><HI>Meroveus</HI> immediately interrup|ted him, to ask News of <HI>Brun|chaut.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Bozon</HI> a&s;&s;ured him that &s;he reign|ed
<PB N="84" REF="62">peaceably in <HI>Au&s;tra&s;ia,</HI> and re|newing his di&s;cour&s;e, he related to the Prince that he was upon the point of returning thither; that if he would &s;uffer him&s;elf to be con|ducted by his zeal, he would pro|cure his liberty; that <HI>Gailan</HI> ex|pected them twenty Paces from thence with a Troop of tru&s;ty Men; that they would go together into that Country, where he did not doubt but the Queen would receive him with open Arms.</P>
<P><HI>Meroveus,</HI> tran&s;ported with joy, at this obliging Di&s;cour&s;e, embra|ced <HI>Bozon,</HI> told him that he would follow him where ever he would lead him, and &s;wear to him that he would equal the recom|pence to the greatne&s;s of the Service.</P>
<P><HI>Bozon</HI> told him that he needed only to come out, and that the Re|ligious,
<PB N="85" REF="62">who had care of the Door, attended. <HI>Meroveus</HI> marched im|mediately with him, they traver|&s;ed all the Cloi&s;ters, and likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed the Door without any ob|&s;tacle; in&s;omuch that this Prince then fancied that Fortune, after &s;o many outrages, would be at length reconciled to him. They went to <HI>Gailan</HI> and the other per&s;ons with him. <HI>Gailan</HI> was in an exta&s;ie to &s;ee his Prince again, for whom he had &s;o tender and &s;o &s;incere an affe|ction. This little Troop, without lo&s;ing any time, marched with all &s;peed towards <HI>Au&s;tra&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>When they were within a League of <HI>Metor, Bozon</HI> remon&s;tra|ted to the Prince, that it was not convenient to pa&s;s further without giving the Queen notice, becau&s;e that the &s;ight of the Prince might allarm all the Court, who would imagine, with &s;ome appearance of
<PB N="110" REF="63">rea&s;on, that it would be a new &s;ub|ject of War with <HI>Chilperick;</HI> that therefore it was fit <HI>Gailan</HI> &s;hould be &s;ent, who, being unknown, might the more ea&s;ily, and without being &s;u&s;pected, &s;peak in &s;ecret to <HI>Brun|chaut.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Meroveus</HI> was loath to con&s;ent to this Propo&s;ition, becau&s;e his love drew him with too much vio|lence towards the Prince&s;s. But he was forced at length to yield to it, and dur&s;t not openly contra|dict <HI>Bozon.

<P>After that <HI>Meroveus</HI> had re|fre&s;hed him&s;elf &s;ometime, in a Country Hou&s;e, <HI>Bozon</HI> asked him,
<PB N="111" REF="63">if he would not go meet <HI>Gai|lan.</HI></P>
<P>This Lover impatiently longing to &s;ee <HI>Brunchaut</HI> again, received this notice with joy.

<P><HI>Bozon</HI> returned immediately to|wards <HI>Paris,</HI> to give an account to <HI>Fredegonda,</HI> and the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inates according to the Order they had received, hid them&s;elves in the Wood, waiting for <HI>Gailan,</HI> who came &s;ome moments after. When he perceived <HI>Meroveus</HI> in &s;o fatal a condition, he was &s;eized with
<PB N="88" REF="64">&s;uch an horrour, which made him make a great &s;hriek.</P>
<P><HI>Meroveus</HI> at this noi&s;e opening his Eyes, and &s;till knowing <HI>Gai|lan,</HI> rallied all the Life he had left him, to ask him how the Queen did?</P>
<P><HI>Gailan</HI> &s;aw that the Prince was upon the point of dying, and that all the help he endeavoured to give him would be u&s;ele&s;s; &s;o that he thought of nothing, but &s;atisfying his la&s;t de&s;ire. He drew a Letter out of his Pocket, that <HI>Brunchaut</HI> had given him, and put into <HI>Me|roveus</HI> his hands.</P>
<P>The Prince re-a&s;&s;umed as much as he could his langui&s;hing looks, he fixed them upon this Paper, and it &s;eemed as if Love &s;topped the &s;troke of Death, to permit this Lo|ver to enjoy this la&s;t delight. So

<P>As &s;oon as the Prince had read the&s;e la&s;t words, he glewed his mouth upon the Paper, and breath'd his la&s;t in a great &s;igh.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the Murder|ers
<PB N="114" REF="65">thundered out of the place they were concealed in, upon <HI>Gai|lan,</HI> accu&s;ed him of the Princes Death; and having &s;eized him, re|turned towards <HI>Paris,</HI> and pre&s;ent|ed him to the King. It was to no purpo&s;e this unhappy Man called Heaven to Witne&s;s his in|nocence, and to make Oaths that cau&s;ed a&s;toni&s;hment and pity in all tho&s;e that heard him. <HI>Fredegonda</HI> upon the Depo&s;ition of her Crea|tures, judged him Criminal, and even per&s;uaded <HI>Chilperick,</HI> who cau&s;ed his No&s;e and Ears, his Feet and Hands to be cut off.</P>
<P>When <HI>Brunchaut</HI> had learn'd this Tragical Death, &s;he did not at all doubt from what hand the Blows came. She would have in|vaded <HI>Chilperick</HI>'s Territories, but as the Publick Intere&s;t was more con&s;iderable than her own, her Council oppo&s;ed this De&s;ign,
<PB N="115" REF="65">wherein there was more to be fear|ed than hoped. Thus all the De|voir &s;he could practice towards <HI>Me|roveus,</HI> was reduced to the giving him her Tears, and to nouri&s;h a long time de&s;ires, without power, to re|venge his Death.</P>
