<HEAD>TO THE
READER.</HEAD>
<P>_I Pre&s;ent you the
va&s;t body of the
Spani&s;h Mo|narchy,
which,
though it hath &s;pread its roots
into many and di&s;tant Pro|vinces,
is but of late growth,
having but little before the la&s;t
age fir&s;t a&s;pired, not only to a
competition with the two anti|ently
<PB REF="3">
ballancing powers of
Chri&s;tendom, <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>France</HI> (for two they were
when <HI>France</HI> depended not on
<HI>England)</HI> but the Empire of
the World. Our near concern|ments
either in peace or war
with it, rendring it very nece&s;|&s;ary
to be known to us, I am wil|ling
to &s;hew it you in &s;uch par|ticular
remarks of the people
and Countrey, as I think you
have not yet &s;een, with &s;ome|thing
of ob&s;ervation on its
&s;odain advance, and almo&s;t
as &s;odain decay; &s;o that it
is no longer a competitor
with the other two, but
<PB REF="3">
&s;o much fallen from it,
it could &s;carcely any longer
&s;ub&s;i&s;t, did not the moderation
and ju&s;tice of one of tho&s;e
Monarchs, oblige him ra|ther
to joyn in &s;upporting
its Throne, then enjoy his
&s;hare of the many advantages,
his maritime power and &s;citu|ation
of his Dominion, might
rea&s;onably promi&s;e by the fall
of it; e&s;pecially in regard by
&s;ending abroad he &s;hall not
need to fear &s;uch a depopu|lation
as it &s;uffers under, when
his doors &s;hall be opened by
Acts of Naturalization and
Regi&s;ters, to admit and &s;ecure
<PB REF="4">
&s;uch as (out of con&s;iderati|on
of the fertility of his Coun|trey,
temperature of its Air,
and convenience for Trade)
will abundantly &s;upply what
may be &s;o exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>The time of taking this &s;ur|vey
&s;ufficiently di&s;covers it
&s;elf in it, and though &s;ome
years &s;ince relates to &s;everal ve|ry
modern tran&s;actions of Chri|&s;tendom
of the highe&s;t concern,
as the Engli&s;h rebellion, renun|ciation
of the Queen of <HI>Swe|den,</HI>
and impri&s;onment of the
Duke of <HI>Lorrain;</HI> neither
have any changes very con&s;ide|rable
&s;ince happened to <HI>Spain,</HI>
<PB REF="4">
either in its Government, Cu|&s;toms,
or Negotiations.</P>
<P>You have in it a clear pro|&s;pect
of decay of Power, with
increa&s;e of Wealth, which
&s;hews you are not undone by
&s;carcity (whether real or
pretended) of tho&s;e adored
Metals for which this People
have &s;old them&s;elves and aban|doned
their Countrey, while&s;t
you abound in all things el&s;e
that contribute either to u&s;e
or plea&s;ure, and they (though
Ma&s;ters of the Fountains of
them) are indeed as indigent
and mi&s;erable as you fancy your
&s;elves to be in the want of
<PB REF="5">
them alone. It makes no le&s;s
evident that when a Nation
(e&s;pecially its Nobility and
Gentry) contemns or neglects
Arms, it is at the highe&s;t, if not
declining. If it be a little Sa|tirical
as to the haughtine&s;s and
&s;ingularity of that People, it
hath al&s;o &s;omething of Pane|geric
as to &s;everal of their Vir|tues,
without which yet I &s;up|po&s;e
it might be tolerated, our
Pre&s;s having formerly made
as bold with mo&s;t of the other
Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> as they
with us.</P>

<HEAD>A
JOURNEY
INTO
SPAIN.</HEAD>
<P>_WHen we left <HI>Italy,</HI> we re&s;olved for
<HI>Spain;</HI> but becau&s;e <HI>M. P.</HI> intend|ing
his Son &s;hould take that Jour|ney
with us, had ordered him to
expect us at <HI>Monpellier,</HI> whither
he had commanded him to repair, from the hou&s;e
of a Gentleman of <HI>Xaintonge,</HI> where he had re&s;ided
&s;ome months, we were obliged to tarry for him.
He came not till the later end of <HI>December,</HI> the
extremity of which &s;ea&s;on pre&s;&s;ing us to &s;pend
the Winter there, we deferred our departure till
the Spring: and the weather in <HI>Languedoc</HI> being
plea&s;ant in March, we went away the 6th of that
month. I &s;hall not concern my &s;elf in de&s;cribing
what we &s;aw in that mo&s;t agreeable Province,
nor in repeating what we learned that was con&s;i|derable,
whil&s;t we traver&s;ed it almo&s;t from one
<PB N="2" REF="6">
end to the other; nor yet &s;ay any thing of <HI>Ga&s;|cony,</HI>
through which we pa&s;&s;ed; nor of <HI>Bayonne,</HI>
where we took our leaves of <HI>France.</HI> Having
travail'd tho&s;e parts only as they lay in our way
to <HI>Spain,</HI> I &s;hall re&s;erve all my curio&s;ity for it,
and not charge my Table-book with any ob&s;er|vations
till I come to the Frontiers of that King|dom.
That I may not neglect many particulars
I learned of the Government, Cu&s;toms, and pre|&s;ent
Condition of the Imperious Nation that in|habits
it, I will here make an Extract of what I
&s;cattered in &s;everal Papers during our abode at
<HI>Madrid:</HI> to put which into method, were to
unravel confu&s;ion it &s;elf; every thing &s;hall there|fore
have its place, as I &s;aw or heard it; and if
&s;ome be repeated more than once, it is becau&s;e I
de&s;ign not a poli&s;hed work, but to give liberty to
my di&s;cour&s;e according to Time, Place, Per&s;ons,
Companies, and Entertainments, and &s;uch refle|ctions
as have pre&s;ented from them; not
confining my &s;elf to what I &s;aw, or happened to
me, or my Company, but enlarging to what was
told us, having ever endeavoured to get the be&s;t
informations po&s;&s;ible. It ought not to &s;eem
&s;trange if in &s;ome places I happen to &s;peak un|truths
without lying, and in others to wander
without knowing I am out of the way, and de|voting
my Book to tho&s;e only that have &s;een its
foundations laid, and materials gathered toge|ther,
to &s;erve us as memorials of part of that time
which for &s;ix years we employed in &s;tudying the
World in its great School, which is Travail: The
mi&s;takes and errors made either by me, or &s;uch
<PB N="3" REF="6">
as I conver&s;ed with, will not to them appear very
con&s;iderable or unea&s;ie to be effaced as &s;oon as
di&s;covered: and if it accidentally happen into o|ther
hands, they may make choice of what is
weighty and certain, leaving what &s;eems light
and doubtful, without any ju&s;t cau&s;e of complaint
again&s;t me on account of that which I write not
for their &s;akes. I have neverthele&s;s endeavoured
to make as few errors as po&s;&s;ible, and what I &s;et
down at night according to the &s;everal Objects
and Companies of the day, I overlook'd next
morning, and made farther enquiry of &s;uch per|&s;ons
as I thought likely to di&s;abu&s;e me if ill in|formed,
and give me clearer light if what I had
received were imperfect. According to this
method I have (better or wor&s;e) &s;atisfied my cu|rio&s;ity
in examining this grave and haughty Na|tion
at its own home, &s;ince it &s;eldom goes abroad
unle&s;s to command others, and &s;ecure its King
of their obedience by Garri&s;ons and Colonies &s;ent
into all parts of his Dominions in the new and old
World, and by the Governments and Magi&s;tra|cies
he be&s;tows upon it, with an intire exclu&s;ion
of the Inhabitants of tho&s;e Countries to which
he di&s;tributes them.</P>
<P>Re&s;olving to enter by way of <HI>St. Seba&s;tian,</HI>
which is the mo&s;t ea&s;ie, we lodged at the la&s;t
Town of <HI>France</HI> called <HI>St. John de Luz.</HI> It is the
Seat of Commerce between the two Frontiers,
and may pa&s;s for a good City, being large, well
built, and rich: Its Mariners are e&s;teemed and
employed in fi&s;hing for Cods, and Whales; and
we found Dutch men there that had hired fifty to
<PB N="4" REF="7">
be made u&s;e of at <HI>New-found-land.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had pa&s;&s;ed <HI>Baione</HI> we perceived
the humour of the people to incline to that of
their Neighbourhood, being in&s;olent and little
complying with &s;trangers: the women in pa&s;&s;ing
the Streets ca&s;t their Coats over their heads, and
&s;o to cover their cheeks di&s;cover their buttocks.
The next day we wanted but two leagues to the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominion, and at a good di&s;tance di&s;cern|ed
<HI>Fontarabia,</HI> a Fort at the falling of <HI>Bida&s;&s;ao</HI> in|to
the &s;ea: This River, or rather Torrent, &s;epa|rates
the two Kingdoms; it is pretty broad at the
Ferry, the Country thereabouts being fenny, and
ebs and flows with the Sea: at low water it is in
many places fordable. <HI>Andaie</HI> a little Town or
Village is &s;eated on its bank, right over again&s;t
<HI>Fontarabia,</HI> and &s;eparated from it only by that
&s;tream: but we were fain to go higher to &s;eek
the Ferry-boat, and were troubled how to find
it, having been wrong directed by the Po&s;t|ma&s;ter,
who does all ill offices he can to tho&s;e
that travail on their own hor&s;es: The <HI>Toll</HI> paid
by the Boats goes half to the <HI>French,</HI> and half to
the <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> one of them receiving it of &s;uch as
pa&s;s into <HI>Spain,</HI> and the other of tho&s;e that tra|vail
into <HI>France,</HI> but both of them equally &s;queez|ing
the Pa&s;&s;enger. The&s;e Frontiers have no le&s;s
Communication than if there were no war be|tween
the two Nations; and it is well for them
it is &s;o; for otherwi&s;e an univer&s;al de&s;olation
would follow. The Country is barren and moun|tainous,
producing nothing but Iron, as well that
which belongs to <HI>France,</HI> as that which is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
<PB N="5" REF="7">
by the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> which is the greate&s;t part&punc;
It is called <HI>Bi&s;cai:</HI> the language is under&s;tood on+ly
by the Inhabitants, and &s;o poor that one word
hath diver&s;e &s;ignifications, &s;o that it cannot
without difficulty be made u&s;e of in Commerce:
None write it, and the Children at School learn
French or Spani&s;h, as they are &s;ubject to either
King.</P>
<P>It does not a little &s;urpri&s;e, when having pa&s;|&s;ed
<HI>Bida&s;&s;ao,</HI> one is no more under&s;tood without
&s;peaking Spani&s;h, when a moment before French
was intelligible. Half a quarter of a league further
is <HI>Iron,</HI> the fir&s;t Town belonging to the King of
<HI>Spain;</HI> they neither demand Pa&s;sport nor Ac|count
of any's bu&s;ine&s;s; and one would think
there were neither warr nor di&s;tru&s;t; only the
Alcalde came for two Reals as a due belonging to
him: but &s;uch as return and pa&s;s into <HI>France</HI> are
not u&s;ed with the like indifference: We were
entertained at the Po&s;thou&s;e, much as we had
formerly been in <HI>Italy</HI> on the way to <HI>Naples,</HI> but
more &s;lenderly: little Di&s;hes with little bits of
meat, made us de&s;pair of filling our bellies; but
at la&s;t one after another enow were brought to
&s;atisfie us. When the reckoning came they flee|ced
us, and we were forced to give four Crowns
for a Meal that was not worth one. Over &s;everal
Mountains, and by a way very rough and &s;tony,
we got that night to lye at <HI>St. Seba&s;tians,</HI> where
we arrived before we were aware, it being co|vered
by a great bank of &s;and, which pa&s;&s;ed, the
Town appears at the foot of a Mountain that
keeps off the &s;ea, though &s;he embraces it almo&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="8">
on all &s;ides, and enters far enough to make a Ha|ven;
but for greater &s;afety to Ships, there is a
Redout in form of a Ba&s;in, they riding at the
Town &s;ide, and foot of the Mountain, where
they &s;eem &s;ecure from &s;torms, though we were
told &s;ome have ri&s;en to that height that they have
broken in pieces &s;uch as anchored there.</P>
<P>Greater Ve&s;&s;els cannot enter, the water &s;erv|ing
only for Barks and Shallops: Ships of Warr
ride a quarter of a league lower, towards <HI>Fonta|rabia,</HI>
where is the Ar&s;enal for the Oceans Fleet,
at pre&s;ent in no very good condition. It returned
from <HI>Bourdenux</HI> much weather-beaten, and for
want of money nothing is done towards refit|ting
it.</P>
<P>Before <HI>St. Seba&s;tian</HI> there is a great Ship on
the Stocks intended for Admiral: it will be a
&s;tately Ve&s;&s;el if ever fini&s;hed: we were told it
had been long in the condition in which we &s;aw
it, and that more money had been &s;pent about it
than would have &s;erved for a dozen &s;uch Fabricks,
of which the greate&s;t part became a prey to the
Over&s;eers.</P>
<P><HI>Bilbo</HI> and <HI>St. Seba&s;tian</HI> are the principal Ha|vens
the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath on the Ocean;
<HI>Corugna</HI> al&s;o is &s;poken of, where the Marquis of
<HI>St. Cruz</HI> tarried &s;omewhat too long, while&s;t re|volted
<HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> for want of his Succors, was
ready to return to its Kings obedience: he could
not have cho&s;en a fitter place to refre&s;h his Fleet,
none on that Coa&s;t abounding more with Limons
and Oranges, which from thence are tran&s;ported
into <HI>England, France,</HI> and <HI>Holland;</HI> and if he
<PB N="7" REF="8">
was better plea&s;ed there than he &s;hould have
been in fighting, Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Vendo&s;me,</HI> he payed
dear enough for it, having been detained pri&s;o|ner
ever &s;ince his return from &s;o famous an expe|dition.
<HI>St. Seba&s;tian</HI> is &s;eated in a very little
Province called <HI>Guipu&s;coa;</HI> Trafick draws to it
a great concour&s;e, though the Town be but &s;mall,
it is very compact, and extremely populous, one
hou&s;e containing &s;everal Families. A Merchant
Stranger is there forced to lodge with &s;ome Citi|zen,
it not being permitted him to be a Hou&s;e|keeper:
many Dutch men are obliged to live in
this manner. The cu&s;tom was thus introduced;
&s;trangers at the fir&s;t &s;ettling of Trafick out of
meer liberality gave their Landlords as a Gratuity
one in the hundred of all the Commodities they
&s;old; and the Inhabitants to pre&s;erve this profit
made &s;uch an Order, which hath cau&s;ed &s;ome that
would not ob&s;erve it to be &s;ued at Law. That
which mo&s;t plea&s;ed me in this Town, was, that
the Streets are wide, &s;treight, and very well pa|ved
with a broad &s;tone, like that of <HI>Florence.</HI> The
principal Revenue of the Country is drawn from
Iron-mills, &s;ome of them of a very pure mettal,
and &s;o rich they may furni&s;h all <HI>Europe:</HI> Wools
of old <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> are al&s;o &s;hipped here, &s;ent in good
quantity by the Merchants of diver&s;e places. The
Baron of <HI>Batteville,</HI> a Gentleman of the <HI>Franch
Contie</HI> (who was then pre&s;ent) is Governor,
and with it of all <HI>Guipu&s;coa.</HI> Though he hath
rendered very many good &s;ervices to <HI>Spain,</HI> par|ticularly
in the Troubles of <HI>Ga&s;conie)</HI> and &s;o &s;ea|&s;ea&s;oned
him&s;elf with Spani&s;h Cu&s;toms, that he
<PB N="8" REF="9">
hath forgotten his own Language and Country;
this employment, to which that of Admiral is
joyned, draws on him no little envy. We waited
on him, and he received us well, but returned not
our Vi&s;it, and we went away without bidding
him adieu. Here we &s;tayed three dayes, and
kept our Ea&s;ter: we had been recommended to
a worthy Merchant, who after Dinner carried us
to a Nunnery, where we heard mo&s;t pitiful Mu|&s;ick.
This Cloi&s;ter is on an Eminence, from which
the Town that is overagain&s;t it may be very well
battered; and the Ca&s;tle or Citadel which is on
the top of a hill, at who&s;e foot the Town &s;tands,
&s;eems rather a Sentry-hou&s;e to watch, than a For|tre&s;s
to defend it.</P>
<P>On Tue&s;day in Ea&s;ter-week, having been
treated by our Merchant, we took the way of
<HI>Madrid,</HI> 84 leagues di&s;tant. The Country we
pa&s;&s;ed through is mountainous and barren, and
we perceived that we traver&s;ed the tops of the
<HI>Pirenean,</HI> which almo&s;t divide <HI>Spain,</HI> as the <HI>Ape|nine
Italy.</HI> Nece&s;&s;ity quickly taught us the Mode
of the Country, which obliges Travailers to
buy in &s;everal places all accommodations nece&s;|&s;ary.
We tarried a while at <HI>St. Seba&s;tians,</HI> part|ly
to provide us a <HI>Moco de Mulas,</HI> that is a Ser|vant
or Guide, to bring us to <HI>Madrid,</HI> to whom
it belongs to buy victual, and carry other provi|&s;ions:
Forty Crowns were demanded of us for
the attendance of one of tho&s;e Ra&s;cals, which
being &s;o dear, we re&s;olved not to take any, and
to guide our &s;elves as well as we could. The part
of <HI>Moco de Mulas</HI> fell to my &s;hare: I &s;hall give
<PB N="9" REF="9">
you the particulars of this imployment, and of
travailing in <HI>Spain.</HI> At the fir&s;t arrival at an Inn
you ask for Beds, which being provided, you ei|ther
give the meat you bring raw with you to the
Ho&s;t to be dre&s;&s;ed, or go your &s;elf and buy it in
the Market: if you find any Capon, Pullet, or Par|tridge
you &s;eek to make &s;ure of them. We were
told we &s;hould meet plenty of the la&s;t, fatter,
larger, and better than tho&s;e of <HI>France;</HI> but in
all our Journey we found but one, neither had it
all tho&s;e advantages. The be&s;t way is to carry
your provi&s;ion along with you in Wallets, and
provide what you find on the place to be made
u&s;e of the next day. Coming to your Inn, you
go abroad to buy bread, wine, and eggs; for
&s;omething of tho&s;e is u&s;ually to be had, but none
allowed to &s;ell them except &s;uch as farm that
Priviledge: Exci&s;e goes &s;o high, that the King
hath a <HI>quarto</HI> upon every egge. The&s;e Inns are
&s;ad &s;pectacles, and the &s;ight of them gives one a
belly full. The fire is made on a hearth in the
middle of the Kitchin, choked with &s;o thick a
&s;moke, that you would think your &s;elf in the Ken|nel
of a Fox that the Hunters would drive out&punc;
a man or woman all in rags like a begger, and no
le&s;s low&s;ie, mea&s;ures the wine to you, which is
drawn from a Hogs, or Goats skin, in which it is
kept, and which is to it both Barrel and Celler:
the be&s;t wine out of the&s;e is a very unplea&s;ant
liquor, having a mo&s;t abominable ta&s;te of the
pitched hide. The White-wine is as fiery as <HI>Aqua|vitae,</HI>
yet bears not water, the lea&s;t drop being
mixed with it, becoming in&s;ipid and without
<PB N="10" REF="10">
&s;pirit. By what I have &s;aid may be gathered how
ill living is in <HI>Spain;</HI> yet I found it not &s;o bad as
I expected, e&s;pecially in <HI>Bi&s;cai,</HI> though a Coun|try
le&s;s fertile then <HI>Ca&s;tile.</HI> It is true indeed, that
being a Frontier, it is not &s;o much taxed, and the
People enjoy greater liberty, and &s;ome provi&s;i|ons
may be found in the Inns, but at double their
value.</P>
<P>About a day and a halfs Journey from <HI>St. Se|ba&s;tian</HI>
we pa&s;&s;ed over a pretty high Mountain
called <HI>St. Adrians;</HI> it is none of the &s;teepe&s;t or
craggie&s;t, but that which I found mo&s;t remarka|ble,
is that on the top of it runs a ridge of rock,
which hinders pa&s;&s;ing; one would think it pla|ced
there by nature, as a fixed and in&s;urmounta|ble
&s;eparation between <HI>Bi&s;cai</HI> and old <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> in
&s;uch a manner, that they have been fain to open
a way with much difficulty; for the rock is cut
thorough thirty or forty paces: In this there is
one hou&s;e, which mu&s;t needs be very well roofed,
having &s;o great a Ma&s;s of the quarry to cover it.
Freed from this wonderful pa&s;&s;age, we de&s;cended
into old <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> &s;omething more plain, though not
much more fertil. We found here no le&s;s trouble
than on the <HI>Alpes</HI> at the Mountain of St. <HI>Godard,</HI>
night &s;urpri&s;ing us in the middle of the de&s;cent,
and for increa&s;e of our misfortune, we could get
no lodging at the next Village: this the more
incommoded us in regard one of our hor&s;es had
lo&s;t both his &s;hoes before: notwith&s;tanding which
we were forced to &s;eek entertainment in another
mi&s;erable Village (to which the Ho&s;t was our
Guide) which afforded us only bread and wine,
<PB N="11" REF="10">
and two wretched Beds, who&s;e Sheets and Ma|tre&s;&s;es
could not oblige us to put off our cloths.</P>
<P>We began now to approach the heart of <HI>Spain,</HI>
having entred the old <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> where &s;tands the
City of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> for a long time the Seat of its
Kings, the Country is all &s;and, and little hillocks
of unfertil earth, often interrupted by Mountains
hooded with rocks, unle&s;s in &s;ome few places
where &s;mall Plains and Valleys appear, that af|ford
the Inhabitants &s;uch provi&s;ions as &s;u&s;tain
them. But never did I &s;ee any Country le&s;s beau|tified
with Gardens: I know not whether by
rea&s;on the &s;oil affords them not, or that the peo|ple
are not indu&s;trious enough to take care of
them.</P>
<P>Coming near <HI>Vittoria,</HI> the fir&s;t City of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI>
we pa&s;&s;ed through the faire&s;t and be&s;t cultivated
Plain we had till then &s;een: that little City is &s;eat|ed
at the end of it, as &s;eemed to us, very plea|&s;antly:
we re&s;ted there half a day, as well to &s;hoe
our hor&s;es, as to deliver a letter we had for the
Ma&s;ter of the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, from whom we
hoped addre&s;&s;es nece&s;&s;ary to continue our Jour|ney
&s;ecurely. We heard rumours of Theeves, and
beyond <HI>Burgos</HI> a great Robberie had been lately
committed. This Letter was very u&s;eful to us,
for till then we had not been any wayes mole&s;ted
about our hor&s;es or baggage, but we were a&s;&s;u|red,
that had we only pa&s;&s;ed the Gate without a
Ticket from the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e all had been con|fi&s;cated.
It fell out very luckily for us to have a
letter to him that is the Kings Farmer, who as
&s;oon as he had received it, vi&s;ited us, and not only
<PB N="12" REF="11">
cau&s;ed a &s;ufficient Pa&s;sport to be given us,
but made us a Pre&s;ent of Wine, Capons and
Neats-tongues, with which furni&s;hing our Knap|&s;acks,
we had recour&s;e to them in ca&s;e of nece&s;|&s;ity.
The civility of this <HI>Spaniard</HI> was very plea|&s;ing
to us, and made us judge this Nation more
generous then the <HI>Italians,</HI> though they be equal|ly
for their particular intere&s;ts, and one of them
as little communicable as the other.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>April</HI> we dined at <HI>Pancorbo,</HI> and
lay at <HI>Miranda,</HI> and the next day did the like
at <HI>Barbie&s;ca</HI> and <HI>Mona&s;terio de Rodillas;</HI> the
Third we arried at <HI>Burgos,</HI> the chief City of
<HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> and &s;o con&s;iderable in both <HI>Ca&s;tiles,</HI>
that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the fir&s;t place, though di&s;puted
by <HI>Toledo:</HI> we were not at all troubled with
heat on our way, but not a little that day with
cold; a &s;harp wind cau&s;ed a hoar fro&s;t, and in
&s;ome places Ice: <HI>Burgos</HI> is the colde&s;t City of
<HI>Spain,</HI> being &s;eated at the foot of a high Moun|tain;
it hath formerly enjoyed a con&s;iderable
Trade, which of later days is almo&s;t lo&s;t; it is
not very great; and the mo&s;t remarkable things
in it are the Church and Arch-bi&s;hops Palace,
admirable Fabricks for <HI>Spain,</HI> where generally
they build ill; in &s;ome places becau&s;e they are
poor, and in others for want of Lime and Stones,
&s;o that in every part, and even in <HI>Madrid</HI> it
&s;elf, many hou&s;es are made of earth; and the
be&s;t Fabricks cimented with Clay in&s;tead of
Mortar. Another ornament of <HI>Burgos,</HI> is a
large and very convenient Bridge, pa&s;&s;ing from
the Suburbs to the City: its inhabitants are
<PB N="13" REF="11">
thought to &s;peak the be&s;t <HI>Ca&s;tilian;</HI> this Ter|ritory,
of a certain breeds the be&s;t &s;oldiers, and
very few afford the King a greater number; we
received extraordinary civilities from a Merchant,
to whom we were recommended by the Cu&s;tomer
of <HI>Vittoria.</HI> He did not only inquire us out com|pany
for our journey to <HI>Madrid,</HI> becau&s;e of the
danger of Thieves; but finding us in a lodging
where we could not be well entertained, after
&s;hewing us the Town, carried us to his Hou&s;e,
where he Treated us at Dinner with a frankne&s;s,
much more valuable then his good cheer; it was
&s;erved in di&s;h after di&s;h, and began by a &s;lender
potage, with two or three &s;lices of bread in it;
every one of us had an earthen porrenger of
it pre&s;ented him, but the Saffron and Pepper
gave &s;uch a hogo, it could hardly be eaten.
It was on a <HI>Saturday</HI> and according to the cu&s;tom
of that Countrey to eat on &s;uch days, the heads
and intrails of Sheep and Oxen, we had &s;uch
meats, &s;o that we fared much better then we
&s;hould have done by hunting among the Ta|verns
and victualing hou&s;es to make our own
provi&s;ion: be&s;ides, the gallantry of his manner
of Treating, &s;urprzed us, conducting us with a
great deal of freedom into the chamber where
the Cloth was laid, and his wife lay &s;ick abed of
a Quartane Ague; that day I &s;purred up my me|mory
to furni&s;h me with all the Spani&s;h, had
lain dormant there, &s;ince I &s;tudied it at <HI>Florence,</HI>
and lighting on any expre&s;&s;ion of civility,
repeated it &s;o often, that it was very evident,
Compliments were &s;carce with me; <HI>M. P.</HI> &s;poke
<PB N="14" REF="12">
now and then a word, and <HI>M. S.</HI> was continu|ally
&s;ilent, &s;o that the burthen of the entertain|ment
lay all on me, who knew not very well how
to acquit my &s;elf, e&s;pecially, when the wife
began to &s;peak from the bed; I knew not whe|ther
I was to Treat her with <HI>Vue&s;tra Merced,</HI> or
<HI>Vue&s;tra Sennoria,</HI> which &s;o confounded me, that
often &s;uppo&s;ing, the fir&s;t belonged onely to men,
I blu&s;hed as if I had committed &s;ome hainous
crime, and recalling my &s;elf, brought out the
&s;econd, due only to per&s;ons of eminent Qua|lity,
for <HI>Vue&s;tra Merced</HI> is of all genders, and
&s;o common, that Grooms and Footmen ho|nour
one another with it: To bring my &s;elf
off, I drank her good health, &s;aying, <HI>Sennora
a la Salud de</HI> XXXX and there was gravell'd,
not knowing which word to chu&s;e, and I think
I made u&s;e of both, <HI>que dios le dia prompta gua|ri&s;on,</HI>
I cannot tell whether &s;he under&s;tood me,
for I have &s;ince been told, the la&s;t word is not
Spani&s;h; but this I am &s;en&s;ible of, that I com|mitted
a great incivility by putting off my Hat,
which is never done there at Table: Having
made better u&s;e of our teeth then tongues,
it was at la&s;t, time to be gone; the Ma&s;ter of the
hou&s;e, according to the cu&s;tom of the Coun|trey,
leading the way, for as they button con|trary
to other nations, they are al&s;o contrary in
this particular; and they &s;ay, that in accompa|nying
the &s;tranger, the Ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e goes
fir&s;t to leave the other in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. I forgot to
give the woman a parting Compliment. Coming
back to the Inn, where we alighted, we found
<PB N="15" REF="12">
the widow that kept it, drunk, on which I mu&s;t
take occa&s;ion to &s;ay, that I never &s;aw &s;o many
women drunk in <HI>Germany,</HI> as on this &s;ide the
<HI>Pireneans;</HI> this was the &s;econd that gorged
with wine, which they &s;end for to Taverns,
came to pi&s;s before us all in the Stable. Though
we had almo&s;t re&s;olved to lie at <HI>Burgos,</HI> as &s;oon
as we had left our Merchant, our minds alter'd,
becau&s;e we were told that three Leagues from
thence we &s;hould find a very good Inn, but our
&s;ervants being walked abroad, had like to have
hindred our putting this in execution. One of
them having enter'd a Church with &s;purs on,
the Gates were &s;hut upon him, till he payed
money exacted as on &s;hipboard, but at la&s;t he
freed him&s;elf; we pre&s;ently took hor&s;e, and as
&s;oon as out of Town, mi&s;&s;ed our way; after which,
making u&s;e of a Prie&s;t we met with for our guide,
we happened to be very ill lodged: the next day
cold and rainy, we dined at <HI>Lerma,</HI> where ha|ving
lit on a good Inn, we continued till the
morning after; we went to &s;ee the Palace of the
Lord of it, next the <HI>E&s;curial,</HI> e&s;teemed the fai|re&s;t
in <HI>Spain,</HI> It is a va&s;t Fabrick, but ill con|triv'd,
without either Garden or Plantation for
Walks: being holiday, the inhabitants were to|gether,
drinking in a large Hall, into which, as
&s;oon as we enter'd, they very civilly pre&s;ented
us Wine, and the Corrigidor, or chief Officer of
the place, entertained and &s;hewed us &s;everal
rooms of the Palace.</P>
<P>Leaving <HI>Lerma</HI> the 5th, we arrived at <HI>Ma|drid</HI>
the 9th. where we were very glad to be, as
<PB N="16" REF="13">
well to re&s;t our &s;elves as to enjoy a milder Climat,
for in <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> we were tormented with continual
cold wind and rain, and a Countrey &s;o Steril,
that we could not but rejoyce to approach one
&s;omething le&s;s &s;avage. An inexpre&s;&s;ible number
of <HI>French</HI> pilgrims pa&s;s to and from <HI>St. James</HI> in
<HI>Galicia,</HI> the occa&s;ion of the Spaniards calling them
<HI>Gavachos,</HI> this makes evident that <HI>France</HI> abounds
in people, and tho&s;e very idle, in &s;uch a man|ner
to pe&s;ter the roads of <HI>Spain.</HI> Ignorance,
poverty and abu&s;e in matters of Religion, cau&s;e
this di&s;order, and that a great many poor pil|grims
(not entertain'd here as in <HI>Italy,</HI> the
Ho&s;pitals affording only hou&s;e-room) die every
year in <HI>Spain.</HI> The be&s;t Town we &s;aw on the way
was <HI>Aranda de Duero,</HI> where we provided our
&s;elves to pa&s;s the 7th the Mountain of <HI>Samo&s;ierra,</HI>
which &s;eparates Old <HI>Ca&s;tille</HI> from New, in which
<HI>Madrid</HI> &s;tands. The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages are called Ports,
as if there were Rivers to be forded or ferried
over, and at fir&s;t deceived us with the expecta|tion
of &s;ome rapid and difficult Torrent. This
day we &s;uffered by rain, hail, &s;now, and wind,
and found not <HI>Spain</HI> hotter then other Coun|treys,
being almo&s;t frozen in &s;o advanced a &s;ea|&s;on,
and between the two <HI>Ca&s;tiles.</HI> We were not
free from the Mountains, till within Three or
Four Leagues of <HI>Madrid,</HI> the &s;nowy tops of
which are di&s;cerned at it: the Plain in which
it is &s;eated is &s;omewhat uneven, ri&s;ing and fall|ing
every halfe quarter of a League: it is not
adorned by any one tree, the Land on that
&s;ide by which we went towards it is tilled, yet
<PB N="17" REF="13">
&s;eems very barren, con&s;i&s;ting onely of Sand and
light Earth, unle&s;s &s;ome few eminences; no wood,
and abundance of &s;tones: the way all along is
good, as is u&s;ual where Land is bad; and when
we enquired after it, we were an&s;wered with a
Spani&s;h Rhodomontado, that we could not po&s;&s;i|bly
mi&s;s it, becau&s;e the greate&s;t high-way in the
world. On the &s;ide we enter'd it appears not
much, but on that where <HI>Buon retiro</HI> &s;tands,
gives a very agreeable Pro&s;pect. It is not walled,
the Streets are large, but foul, and &s;tinking They
which calculate all the ordures ca&s;t into them,
&s;ay they are daily perfumed by above a hundred
thou&s;and Clo&s;e-&s;tools; the Pavement is &s;o defe|ctive,
and the Coaches &s;o ill hung, that to ride
in them over &s;o uneven ground is to be broken
on the Wheel. Hou&s;es (as well as all things el&s;e)
are very dear here. They build only with brick
and clay, having little lime, and no &s;tone but
what is brought &s;even leagues from about the E&s;|curial.
A Hou&s;e that in another place were very
incon&s;iderable is &s;old here for 20 or 25 thou&s;and
crowns. Whoever builds is concluded to have a
Pur&s;e very well lined. They which return from
Governments beyond &s;ea, demoli&s;h their Hou&s;es
and build Palaces, which make appear they have
either been Viceroys of <HI>Naples,</HI> or Governors
of <HI>Flanders</HI> or <HI>Milan.</HI> In this manner this
Town, which is new, and the greate&s;t part very
&s;lightly built, according to the abilities of the In|habitants,
becomes every day more beautiful, as
the better part of the Kings Revenue, is appro|priated
to tho&s;e that have the managing of it.
<PB N="18" REF="14">
<HI>La Placa Major</HI> is very fair, &s;omething more
long than large, the hou&s;es on all &s;ides uniform,
and the highe&s;t in <HI>Madrid.</HI> They are all en|compa&s;&s;ed
by two or three ranks of Balconies,
which &s;erve to &s;ee the Fea&s;ts of Bulls, the famou&s;|e&s;t
Ceremonies of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Report &s;peaks this Diverti&s;ement to have been
derived from the Moors, and indeed it &s;avours
not a little of their Brutality: It &s;uits &s;o &s;trange|ly
with the genius of this People, that no Town
is &s;o mean but it hath its peculiar Fea&s;ts, and
think a Cur&s;e would follow &s;hould they omit
&s;olemni&s;e them. The King cannot ab&s;ent him&s;elf
from tho&s;e of <HI>Madrid</HI> without the murmurs of
the People. His Palace is at one end of the Town,
on an almo&s;t indi&s;cernable ri&s;ing, that &s;ide on
which we went to it enjoys the pro&s;pect of a
little River, and part of a Valley in which are
&s;ome trees: by it he can pa&s;s to <HI>la Ca&s;a del
Campo,</HI> a wretched Hou&s;e of Plea&s;ure, without
other Ornament than a few Walks in a Wood.</P>
<P>On this Brook, rather than River, <HI>Philip</HI> the
Second built a very great and broad Bridge, &s;ome
of its arches not touched by any water: And I
believe it was rather made for a more commodi|ous
pa&s;&s;ing the de&s;cent of the Valley, than to be
a great Bridge to little or no River. The Kings
Hou&s;e hath nothing magnificent, yet is not &s;o
mean as was reported to us. There is a very fair
Piazza before it, to which it repre&s;ents no un|hand&s;ome
Fronti&s;pice, were the building higher,
and a defective Tower fini&s;hed. It hath two Qua|drangles
very large: All Councils meet in the
<PB N="19" REF="14">
Palace, and the King by private Galleries can go
to any of the Rooms where they &s;it. There is a
great Concour&s;e, and no le&s;s noi&s;e, when any of
them are a&s;&s;embled: But in the Kings Apartment
all is very &s;till, and no body appears till he goes
to Ma&s;s, the only time of &s;eeing him: His Hal|berdiers
are then drawn out on each &s;ide the Gal|lerie,
by which he pa&s;&s;es; The&s;e are <HI>Germans,
Burgundians,</HI> and <HI>Spaniards,</HI> about two or three
hundred, wearing all Liveries of yellow trim|med
with red Velvet. When he comes from his
Apartment the Captain of the Gard goes before
him, and he is followed only by two or three
Per&s;ons. Pa&s;&s;ing between the&s;e Halberdiers he
receives &s;uch Petitions as are pre&s;ented him. One
day as he went to Chappel we would have gone
in before, the better to view him, but a Door-keeper
(as formerly happened at <HI>Ratisbone</HI> on
&s;uch an occa&s;ion) told us, that none were to en|ter
unle&s;s clothed in black. I liked no Hou&s;e in
this Town &s;o well as the Pri&s;on, where yet I
would lea&s;t de&s;ire to lodge: It is a ma&s;&s;ie &s;olid
building, the Windows fortified with great barrs
of Iron, as much for ornament as &s;ecurity: they
are artificially wrought and guilded, &s;o that my
mi&s;take will not &s;eem very &s;trange, who at fir&s;t
thought it the habitation of &s;ome Grandee of
<HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>All agree that no City of <HI>Spain</HI> is &s;o populous
as this, and excepting <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Paris</HI> I never
&s;aw &s;o many Coaches in any; they are drawn by
Mules only, and none but the Kings and the Ma|&s;ters
of his Hor&s;e with more than four: They are
<PB N="20" REF="15">
no wayes magnificent but in &s;ome &s;light guildings
of the Iron-works, and about the Boots: the
greate&s;t part of them are covered with waxed
cloth. On one &s;ide of the Town is the <HI>Prado,</HI> a
large Walk made u&s;e of for the <HI>Tour;</HI> near it is a
great Fabrick, but low, called <HI>Buen Retiro.</HI>
The Duke of <HI>Olivares,</HI> during his admini&s;tration,
&s;pent many Millions on a Structure that is not
very con&s;iderable: I &s;aw but part of it, where
a Comedy was preparing with Scenes, that would
amount to a great expence; a <HI>Florentine</HI> was the
Undertaker. For ordinary Comedies here are
two Theaters, where they act every day: The
Players have to them&s;elves not above three half
pence for every per&s;on, the Ho&s;pital as much,
and as much the Town-hou&s;e; to &s;et down it
co&s;ts &s;even pence, the whole amounting to fifteen
pence. I can &s;ay little to the Lines or Plots, not
being skilful enough in the language to under|&s;tand
Poetry, nor the figurative fa&s;hion of &s;peak|ing
that belongs to it: but know they play their
parts ill, few or none having either the meen or
genius of true Actors. They pre&s;ent by day-light,
&s;o that their Scenes appear not with ad|vantage:
Their Clothes are neither rich, nor ap|propriated
to their Subject; and the Spani&s;h ha|bit
&s;erves where the Scene is <HI>Greece</HI> or <HI>Rome.</HI>
The Playes I have &s;een have but three Acts, called
<HI>Jornadas:</HI> They u&s;ually begin by a Prologue in
Mu&s;ick, but &s;ing &s;o ill, that their harmony re|&s;embles
little Childrens whinings: Between the
Acts there is &s;ome little Farce, Dance, or Intri|gue,
the mo&s;t diverting of the whole Piece: The
<PB N="21" REF="15">
people are &s;o taken with them it is hard to get
place, the be&s;t being be&s;poken, and the exce&s;&s;ive
idlene&s;s of this Country, as that of <HI>England,</HI> is
made evident in that in <HI>Paris</HI> it &s;elf, though there
are not Playes every day, there is no &s;uch crowd|ing
to them. Having with &s;ome exactne&s;s re|ported
the particularities of &s;uch places as we &s;aw,
I will now acquaint you with what I in general
ob&s;erved of the Spani&s;h humor and Government.
This Nation is thought to be very proud and di&s;|dainful,
but is really neither &s;o much as it &s;eems:
its meen doubtle&s;ly is deceitful, and they which
frequent it find not all the vanity imagined, and
may perceive it to be a vice proceeding rather
from erroneous Morals than an in&s;olent temper.
To Hector it both in words and ge&s;tures, &s;eems
to them a &s;ymtome of a great &s;oul; and vi&s;iting
other Countries, little or not at all they di&s;cover
not this defect, derived to them from the fir&s;t
milk they &s;uck, and the fir&s;t Sun gives them
light.</P>
<P>Some <HI>Spaniards</HI> are &s;o ignorant that they be|lieve
not there is any other Country than <HI>Spain,</HI>
other City than <HI>Madrid,</HI> or King than their own.
When I &s;peak of ignorant <HI>Spaniards,</HI> I mean
tho&s;e meer <HI>Ca&s;tillians</HI> who never having quitted
their Thre&s;hold, know not whether <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI>
be in <HI>Europe,</HI> or the <HI>Indies.</HI> The Nobility and
Grandees go little out of <HI>Madrid,</HI> neither as
Soldiers nor Travailers, unle&s;s commanded and
employed. They have no information either by
Gazetts or other news written or printed, and I
never more admired any thing than that this Na|tion
<PB N="22" REF="16">
we e&s;teem &s;o politick, and imperious, Ma|&s;ters
of the &s;ecret of the univer&s;al Monarchy, and
capable of impo&s;ing fetters on the re&s;t of Chri|&s;tendom,
hath &s;o very few able heads, among&s;t
whom it is thought the Earl of <HI>Castriglio,</HI> Vice|roy
of <HI>Naples</HI> is none of the meane&s;t: <HI>Pignoranda,
Don Lewis de Haro,</HI> and <HI>Don Fernando de Con|treras</HI>
govern all. The Earl of <HI>Ognate</HI> is a great
head-piece, but the Favourite is jealous of him,
and as much as po&s;&s;ible keeps him from affairs.
The Grandees of <HI>Spain</HI> appear &s;uch only at a
di&s;tance: here they &s;eemed to me very little, and
without any other advantages than to put on
their hats, and &s;it down in the Kings pre&s;ence;
in other particulars I never ob&s;erved le&s;s inequa|lity
in the mo&s;t popular Republick. A Shoe|maker
when he hath laid a&s;ide his Awl and La&s;t,
and hung his Sword and Dagger by his &s;ide, will
hardly give the fir&s;t &s;alute to him he wrought for
in his Shop a moment before. You cannot &s;peak
to one of the mo&s;t inferior of the rabble without
giving him titles of honor; and they treat one
another with <HI>Senores Cavalleros.</HI> If a Beggar
&s;eeks an Alms, and you refu&s;e him, it mu&s;t not be
without a Compliment, <HI>Pardone Vue&s;tra merced,
no tengo diveros:</HI> pardon me Sir, I have no money.
No other Prince lives like the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> his
employments are continually the &s;ame, in &s;uch a
manner, that he at all times knows how every
day of his life is to be pa&s;&s;ed over: You would
think &s;ome indi&s;pen&s;able Law prohibited his omit|ting
to do according to cu&s;tom; &s;o that neither
weeks, months, years, nor hours change any
<PB N="23" REF="16">
thing of his manner of living, nor pre&s;ent him
any thing new. As &s;oon as he ri&s;es and recollects
what day it is, he knows what bu&s;ine&s;&s;es he is to
di&s;patch, or what plea&s;ures to enjoy. He hath cer|tain
hours for forain and dome&s;tick Audiences,
and for &s;igning all that tends to the expedition of
his Affairs, di&s;po&s;&punc;d of his Trea&s;ure, Meals, and
Devotions. And I have been a&s;&s;ured that what|ever
happens he continues firm in &s;uch a manner
of acting. Every Saturday he goes to a Church
at the farther end of the old Pardo called <HI>At<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">cha,</HI>
where he hath a mo&s;t particular Devotion to the
Holy Virgin, &s;aying it is from her he hath recei|ved
&s;o great favours, and admirable a&s;&s;i&s;tances in
his greate&s;t extremities. <HI>France</HI> al&s;o imputes all
its &s;ucce&s;&s;es to her mediation, and the advanta|ges
of the&s;e potent Kingdoms, having been &s;o
long diametrically oppo&s;ite, it &s;eems &s;omething
incon&s;i&s;tent, that (little happine&s;s coming to one
without the others misfortune) they can both
boa&s;t to have her propitious. Every year at the
&s;elf &s;ame time he goes to his Hou&s;es of plea&s;ure,
and they &s;ay nothing but &s;ickne&s;s can prevent his
retiring to <HI>Aranjuez, Pardo,</HI> or the <HI>E&s;curial</HI> in
the Months he had wont to enjoy the Air of the
Country. In a word, they which have &s;poken to
me of this humor, tell me it is very conformable
to his Meen and Port, and they that are near
him a&s;&s;ured me, that when they &s;peak to him he
changes neither look nor po&s;ture, but receives,
hears, and an&s;wers them with the &s;ame counte|nance,
nothing in all his body being moveable
but his lips and tongue. This gravity, whether
<PB N="24" REF="17">
natural or affected, is in this Country &s;o e&s;&s;ential
a part of Maje&s;ty, that we were told that the
Queen one day, tran&s;ported at dinner to a more
than ordinary laughter, at the ridiculous po&s;tures
and di&s;cour&s;es of a Buffoon, was put in mind, that
to do &s;o became not a Queen of <HI>Spain,</HI> who
ought to be more &s;erious at which &s;urpri&s;ed,
being young, and but newly come out of <HI>Ger|many,</HI>
&s;he &s;aid &s;he could not help it unle&s;s that
fellow were taken away, and that they &s;hould
not have brought him thither if they would not
have had her laugh at him. Two dayes in the
week he gives publick Audiences, principally to
receive Petitions and Memorials of &s;uch as beg
any favour of him. He an&s;wers not immediately,
but cau&s;es them to be all carried into a certain
place, where they are peru&s;ed by a Secretary of
State, who di&s;tributes them to &s;uch of the &s;eve|ral
Councils, as their contents relate to; after
which he that would be di&s;patched, mu&s;t enquire
at the Secretaries Office what an&s;wer is returned,
but &s;eldom finds any, e&s;pecially if the pretence
be arrears or reward; and when he hath lo&s;t all
hope of hearing what is become of his Petition,
it is permitted him to pre&s;ent as many more as
he plea&s;es, but to little purpo&s;e, for the King &s;el|dom
&s;ees any, and all are carried to the Council
that received the fir&s;t, which having no intention
to &s;atisfie him, returns neither Petition nor An|&s;wer:
For this rea&s;on <HI>Madrid</HI> is ever full of
pretenders, who with the attendance of whole
years, lo&s;e their ink and Paper. His Maje&s;ty
hath al&s;o certain hours in which he &s;igns all ex|peditions
<PB N="25" REF="17">
of State, and of his Trea&s;urie; &s;o that
nothing is done, nor one penny given out without
an Order &s;igned by him, whereas in <HI>France</HI> the
Secretaries of State have the Seal and Signature
of the King in their power, which would give
them oppportunities of doing many things on
their own accompt, &s;hould they abu&s;e it. It is true
yet, that neither here nor there the Secretary
&s;igns or pre&s;ents any thing to be &s;igned, but by
con&s;ent of the Favourite or chief Mini&s;ter: and
<HI>Don Fernando de Contreras,</HI> principal Secretary,
who with <HI>Pigneranda,</HI> and <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI>
governs all, cau&s;es nothing to be &s;igned but what
is approved by the later, and the King intirely
confiding in him, &s;igns all he pre&s;ents without
reading it: for never any Prince was more ea&s;ie,
nor put greater confidence in his Mini&s;ters:
When delivred from <HI>Olivares,</HI> he was no longer
without a Favourite then till the Queens death,
which happened very &s;odainly after the di&s;grace
of that chief Mini&s;ter: Then he received into his
privacy (as they call it here) the Nephew of the
former, at pre&s;ent the mo&s;t powerful in this
Court: He is al&s;o one of the riche&s;t, and po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing
the great wealth he inherited from his Uncle,
contents him&s;elf to enjoy his fame, and neglect
his maximes, which would probably be attended
by the publick hatred, his politicks having been
thought very corrupt and bia&s;&s;ed. It is believed
this Favourite makes no u&s;e of his Ma&s;ters coffers;
and it is but nece&s;&s;ary he &s;pare them, they having
never been &s;o exhau&s;ted; for be&s;ides the Monthly
Pen&s;ions of the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> and tho&s;e that
<PB N="26" REF="18">
follow him, which are very ill paid, this Court is
obliged to an extraordinary charge in <HI>Catalonia,</HI>
and its forces being very weak there, to treat for
three or four thou&s;and Wallons and <HI>Germans,</HI> of
which the poore&s;t foot Souldier will &s;tand it in &s;ix
&s;core crowns. The Marquis <HI>Serra</HI> a noble <HI>Ge|noue&s;e</HI>
(who on that condition returned to <HI>Bar|celona)</HI>
is promi&s;ed a hundred thou&s;and crowns a
month to maintain that Army, and to re&s;i&s;t the
<HI>French.</HI> The <HI>Indian</HI> Fleet was expected, which
brought but 800 thou&s;and crowns on the Kings
accompt the la&s;t year; what it would then bring
was very uncertain, thought it was given out to be
very rich, and that it had aboard it two years Re|venue.</P>
<P>Before the King went to <HI>Aranjuez,</HI> he a&s;&s;em|bled
the E&s;tates of both <HI>Ca&s;tiles,</HI> which con&s;i&s;t
of the Deputies of 22 Towns, each Town &s;end|ing
two. Such A&s;&s;emblies are called <HI>las Cortes.</HI>
The King made them a Speech, and told them,
that of the ten Millions of Gold, his Kingdoms
yearly &s;upply him with, not above three came in|to
his Coffers, and nece&s;&s;ities of State con&s;idered,
it was his plea&s;ure they &s;hould con&s;ult of wayes
to bring the entire &s;um into his hands. That to
this purpo&s;e every Town and Province &s;hould
take care them&s;elves to bring their proportion
into his Exchequer, where he willed them to
&s;uppre&s;s many of the Officers that managed his
Revenue, and devoured the greate&s;t part of it:
after this he al&s;o demanded &s;ome augmentation.
The <HI>Cortes</HI> met, and laboured in this affair, but
it was much feared they would not con&s;ent to
<PB N="27" REF="18">
&s;uch a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, which would undo many, and
&s;ome of their Relations, for the augmentation,
it was believed they would not think the people
able to pay any more, the mi&s;erie and poverty
of the Country con&s;idered. In the mean time
this King, (his ten Millions of crowns excepted)
draws little or nothing from the People; and
<HI>Navarre, Arragon,</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Valentia,</HI>
(not united to the <HI>Ca&s;tiles)</HI> are not thought to
bring up above two Millions.</P>
<P>The great expences to which his Warrs oblige
him, are known to all the world, but &s;ome near|er
home con&s;ume the be&s;t of his Revenue: the&s;e
are many Pen&s;ions, there being hardly any Gran|dee
of <HI>Spain,</HI> Duke, Earl, Marquis, or Knight
that hath not &s;omething from the Publick: not
in recompence of &s;ervice in War; but becau&s;e the
mo&s;t of them are extremely nece&s;&s;itous, in &s;o
much that I have been a&s;&s;ured that many of them
compounding with their Creditors, have a&s;&s;ign|ed
them their Pen&s;ions, re&s;erving only &s;ome &s;mall
&s;um towards a wretched &s;ub&s;i&s;tance. Neither are
any accompted rich (the three Favourites above-mentioned
excepted) but the Duke of <HI>Alva,</HI> the
Marquis of <HI>Leganes,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Ognate,</HI> and two
or three others who&s;e names I have forgotten;
the re&s;t of the Nobility wanting wherewithal to
&s;upply their ordinary expences. But did the King
allow no Pen&s;ions to them, he payes enow to o|thers
to divert a very con&s;iderable part of his In|com.
His Armies abound with Reformadoes,
who receive pay as if actually in &s;ervice: it is
true indeed that the&s;e are &s;o il paid, that I connot
<PB N="28" REF="19">
imagin how they &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and I &s;poke with an <HI>Al|fieres</HI>
that came from <HI>Portugal,</HI> who&s;e Pen&s;ion is
twelve crowns a month, that prote&s;ted he had
not recived &s;ix in &s;ix year.</P>
<P>The Je&s;uits have of late been obliged to bring
&s;ixty thou&s;and crowns into the Kings Coffers,
which very much di&s;gu&s;ted them, and allayed
their zeal in the&s;e quarters for the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au|&s;tria.</HI>
This Sum was &s;hipped by them on the
Indian Fleet, without regi&s;tring it, and upon di&s;|covery
confi&s;cated according to the Law. The
Je&s;uit to who&s;e care it was entru&s;ted, playd his
part &s;o well that the Kings Officers could not
find it, but that which belonged to other Cloy|&s;ters,
being &s;ei&s;ed, they peached, and it became
the Kings, notwith&s;tanding the good Fathers al|leged
it de&s;igned to build a Church in <HI>Navarre,</HI>
in the Town where the Saint the Founder of
their Order was born.</P>
<P>This King &s;pends nothing either in Buildings
or Gardens. Much of ornament might be added
to his Palace, and its height require a Wall in
form of a Terra&s;s, to &s;upport its declining, that
increa&s;es daily. A Wood below it, that &s;erves
only for a Shelter to Rabbits, and a Ne&s;t for
Crows, brought by <HI>Charles</HI> the 5th out of the <HI>Low
Countries,</HI> might be converted into a fair Garden.
The river that pa&s;&s;es by it is called <HI>Maucanarzes,</HI>
not &s;o broad as its name is long; its Channel is
gravelly, and it &s;elf in Summer &s;o low, that in
<HI>June</HI> and <HI>July</HI> Coaches at the <HI>Tour</HI> go through
it. The Bridge, or rather Cau&s;ey, by which it is
pa&s;&s;ed, is both long and large, and co&s;t I know
<PB N="29" REF="19">
not how many thou&s;and Ducats; and he was no
fool, that being told that <HI>Philip</HI> the Second be|&s;towed
&s;o much co&s;t on &s;o poor a River, &s;aid it
was fit either to &s;ell the Bridge or buy Wa|ter.</P>
<P>Gentlemen here contrary to the cu&s;toms of
<HI>England, France</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> live in Cities; few
of them having any priviledges for Hunting or
Hawking, neither Mannors or Va&s;&s;als as with
us, where they are mo&s;t of them Lords of the
Pari&s;hes they dwell in: and indeed the quality
of a private Gentleman is here &s;carcely intelligi|ble,
the people having re&s;pect only for Orders of
Knighthood, and &s;uch as are Titulados, which
comprehends Dukes, Marqui&s;&s;es, and Earls. Here
are yet &s;ome Families whom they call <HI>Solari|egas</HI>
or <HI>de Solar Conocido,</HI> who alone are true
Gentlemen, and can derive pedigrees, of which
they may have te&s;timonies, called <HI>Cartas Execu|torias,</HI>
and on accompt of them, enjoy &s;ome in|con&s;iderable
priviledges. The mo&s;t antient of
their Titles, was that of <HI>Riccos Hombres,</HI> very
different from <HI>Hombre Ricco,</HI> which la&s;t implies
no more but a rich man, but the othet antiently
were the great Lords of <HI>Spain,</HI> before Dukes,
Marqui&s;&s;es and Earls were heard of: They were
covered in tho&s;e days in pre&s;ence of their King,
and alone had deliberative voices in A&s;&s;em|blies.</P>
<P>Neither Governments, nor Military, nor Civil
Charges are here &s;old, which is not altogether &s;o
commendable as it &s;eems at fir&s;t &s;ight; for un|unworthy
per&s;ons (if well looked on by Favo|rites)
<PB N="30" REF="20">
may more ea&s;ily attain them then if they
paid for them, and &s;everal of antient extraction
and great abilities are willing to lay out their
money to put them&s;elves in a condition to &s;erve
their King with honour: neither in Countreys
where Charges are mo&s;t vendible, are they &s;o to
all Chapmen; but to Gentlemen only, and &s;uch
as are qualified for them.</P>
<P>All the while <HI>Olivares</HI> was in favour, he cau&s;|ed
an ill under&s;tanding between the King and his
wife, <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of <HI>Bourbon.</HI> In order to which
(as &s;ome report) he &s;ought to corrupt his
Ma&s;ter with an abominable opinion of certain
gracele&s;s People who in <HI>Madrid</HI> joyned toge|ther
in a Sect, and called them&s;elves <HI>Alum|brad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI>
as much as to &s;ay illuminated, or (if you
plea&s;e) Phanaticks; the&s;e &s;eeking to counte|nance
them&s;elves in their villanies, that they
might commit them with the greater liberty, held
it out as a Maxim, that part of the Go&s;pel was
mi&s;-under&s;tood, and that it was an error to
believe Copulation with a woman (on what
account &s;oever) could render a man blameable
before God.</P>
<P>This King is &s;uppo&s;ed to have had natu|ral
i&s;&s;ue by &s;everal, but none is owned but
<HI>Don John of Au&s;tria,</HI> who&s;e Mother was a <HI>Come|dian.</HI>
Of legitimate Children none grew up but
the Prince and the Infanta, the re&s;t dying very
young. The Prince &s;eemed couragious, but, as
was conjectured, of a nature violent and cruel.
Some report he was taken from &s;o many King|doms
(as who&s;e &s;ole Heir he was con&s;idered)
<PB N="31" REF="20">
by an accidental connivence of <HI>Don Pedro de Ar|ragon</HI>
fir&s;t Gentleman of his Chamber, who one
night giving way to his lying with a Curtezan, he
&s;o overheat him&s;elf that next morning he fell into
a violent Feavour; and the Phy&s;itians ignorant of
what had pa&s;&s;ed, by letting him blood &s;o ex|tremely
exhau&s;ted his Spirits, who&s;e dimunition
was the only cau&s;e of his Di&s;ea&s;e, that they ha|&s;tened
his death. <HI>Don Pedro</HI> either for not pre|venting
or not di&s;covering this to the Phy&s;itians,
continues in di&s;grace, and though Brother of
the Favorite, may not yet return to Court: Per|mi&s;&s;ion
only being given him to dwel at one end
of the Town, where he neither receives nor re|turns
Vi&s;its with any Splendor.</P>
<P>The fall of <HI>Olivares</HI> hath been very publick in
<HI>Europe,</HI> and made appear that Favour, which
hath no other foundation than the Princes affecti|on,
nor &s;upports it &s;elf otherwi&s;e than by the dex|terity
of him that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it, cannot be &s;o dura|ble,
as his that e&s;tabli&s;hed on the Ba&s;is of his good
&s;ervice, renders him nece&s;&s;ary to whom he is
agreeable, and it is reported that this man did
&s;ometimes buoy him&s;elf up in the Kings good af|fection
and opinion, by the very &s;ame incon&s;ide|rable
Artifices, that at la&s;t &s;unk him. Among&s;t
other inventions this is di&s;cour&s;ed; Complaint
having been made that Bread was very dear,
and &s;o &s;carce it could hardly be had in <HI>Madrid,</HI>
becau&s;e he had taken money of all the Neighbou|ring
Villages, to exempt them from an Obliga|tion
lay upon them, to bring a certain quanti|ty
every day to Market, he gave Order that all
<PB N="32" REF="21">
that was in the Town di&s;per&s;ed among &s;everal
Bakers, &s;hould be brought and expo&s;ed in the
&s;treet, by which the King was to pa&s;s to our La|dy
of <HI>Atocha.</HI> They to whom he gave this com|mand
performed it &s;o well, that the Shops and
Stals were loden. The King at &s;ight of &s;uch plen|ty
&s;aid he perceived that they which had told
him of &s;car&s;itie of Bread were impo&s;tors and ly|ers:
For better Confirmation the <HI>Conde</HI> Duke
Ordered they &s;hould bring every day into the
publick Market place all the Bread, they were ob|liged
to, notwith&s;tanding the Exemptions, upon
which the complaints cea&s;ed, and the King a
long time believed that what had been told him
was an effect of the Malice, of &s;uch as emula|ted
and envied his Favourite: But the Queen by
her Wi&s;dom and Patience, at la&s;t ruined him,
and by degrees entred on part of the Govern|ment,
from which his Ambition and Jealou&s;ie
had &s;o long excluded her. As &s;oon as &s;he had
gotten credit with the King her Husband, &s;he
made him under&s;tand the di&s;order of affairs, and
danger of the Crown by his Favorites ill conduct:
and this with &s;o much Prudence that he was bani|&s;hed
the Court; and at la&s;t preparations made to
bring him to this trial. The Queens chief Coun|cellour
on this Extraordinary occa&s;ion, was the
Earl of <HI>Ca&s;triglio,</HI> a very near Kin&s;man of him
&s;he de&s;igned again&s;t. They could not without
great difficulty bring the King to conde&s;cend, but
at la&s;t the Inqui&s;ition concerning it &s;elf, and
charging him with that accurs'd Doctrine of the
<HI>Alumbrados,</HI> and an endeavour to Corrupt the
<PB N="33" REF="21">
King with it, he was very neer being abandon|ed
to it, but this was prevented by his death,
&s;u&s;pected to have been ha&s;tened by poi&s;on, and
that good turn done him by his relations, that
they might the &s;ooner po&s;&s;e&s;s his wealth. <HI>Don
Lewis de Haro</HI> inherited the be&s;t part of it, and to
&s;o great a value that I was told, by one that had
it from his own mouth, his yearly Revenue a|mounts
to 130 thou&s;and Crowns: it is not there|fore
to be wondered if he contents him&s;elf with
the quality of Favorite, or Chief Mini&s;ter, with|out
a greedy hunting after all advantages he
might acquire by it: but though by this he
exempt him&s;elf from the clamors rai&s;ed again&s;t
his Uncle; he is yet &s;upported by very few crea|tures,
not endeavouring to make any, accord|ing
to the Pa&s;quil, comparing him with his
Predece&s;&s;or. Two per&s;ons have ruined <HI>Spain,</HI>
one by doing ill to all, the other by doing good
to none.</P>
<P>Before he came into favour, he was in the
Coach with <HI>Villa Medina,</HI> when he was poni|arded.
This Gentleman was the gallante&s;t Cour|tier,
and greate&s;t wit of <HI>Spain:</HI> the Curious
relate many of his Reparties, of which this is
none of the wor&s;t; coming into a Church, a
Ba&s;on was pre&s;ented him, the u&s;ual receptacle
of Money to redeem &s;ouls from Purgatory; and
he (demanding what &s;um &s;erved to deliver one,
and being an&s;wered, what he plea&s;ed) put in
two pi&s;tols; withal, de&s;iring to know if the &s;oul
were free, which the other a&s;&s;uring him, he
took again his two pi&s;tols, telling him he had
<PB N="34" REF="22">
done enough; the &s;oul being in no danger of
returning. Of all his Gallantries, none co&s;t him
dearer then that of a Mask: he was in love
with the Queen, which he mannaged with &s;o
little caution; it occa&s;ioned him to be cen&s;ured
ra&s;h and indi&s;creet; the goodne&s;s of this Prin|ce&s;s
inclining her to favour men of parts, cau&s;|ed
her (altogether ignorant of his folly) to look
well on him. This ha&s;tened his fall, for be&s;ides
that he could not forbear to mention his Mi|&s;tre&s;s,
which terms better becomming a gallant
then &s;ubject, he appeared in a Mask, in a Suit
embroidered with pieces of Eight, with this word
<HI>Mis amores &s;on reales.</HI> This, though equivocal,
gave occa&s;ion of di&s;cour&s;e to all the world, be|cau&s;e
it was very evident, that he rather de|&s;igned
the eminent object of his love, then
the avarice of which he accu&s;ed him&s;elf. The
violence of his pa&s;&s;ion, made him provide a Co|medy
with Scenes, in which he &s;pent 20 thou|&s;and
Crowns, which (to gain an opportunity
of embracing the Queen, whil&s;t he carried her
out of the danger) he &s;et on fire, and with
them burnt almo&s;t all the hou&s;e. Subjects that
incite their Ma&s;ters jealou&s;ie, &s;tand on precipices.
This man was &s;tabbed in his Coach at noon-day:
when accompanied by <HI>Don Lewis de Haro.</HI></P>
<P>One may very rea&s;onably inquire the occa|&s;ions
of the great expences of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and
how they undo them&s;elves, little of pomp or
luxury appearing among&s;t them, and few of
them going into the wars. They which are
well acquainted with <HI>Madrid,</HI> a&s;&s;ure, that mo&s;t
<PB N="35" REF="22">
Families are ruined by Women: every man keeps
a Mi&s;tre&s;s, or is be&s;otted on a Curti&s;an; who
(none in the world being more witty, impu|dent,
or better skilled in that accur&s;ed mi&s;tery;)
as &s;oon as they en&s;nare any, plume them to the
quick; they mu&s;t have Robes of 30 pi&s;tols
price, which they call <HI>Gardepies,</HI> other accou|trements
an&s;werable, Jewels, Hou&s;hold&s;tuff,
and Coaches. To deny any thing to that Sex,
is accounted di&s;honourable. I was a&s;&s;ured that
the Admiral of <HI>Ca&s;tile</HI> (none of the riche&s;t)
gave at once to one of the&s;e Cattle, Four&s;core
thou&s;and Crowns. One of the <HI>Palavicini</HI> of
<HI>Genoua,</HI> told me, that not long before, an inclina|tion
co&s;t him Two thou&s;and Crowns, and find|ing
him&s;elf delayed by the Baggage to whom he
made his Addre&s;&s;es, he abandoned her, without
obtaining any thing. Here are four Proce&s;&s;ions
without the Town, whereas at &s;o many So|lemn
Rendezvou&s;es they endeavour to &s;et out
them&s;elves. All Gallants then pre&s;ent them,
which if any neglect, they are lo&s;t, and no more
thought per&s;ons of Honour; this makes all with
emulation &s;trive to adorn the&s;e infamous Crea|tures,
and glory not a little in it. No Town in
the World offers &s;o many to publick view ever at
all hours of the day, all Streets and Walks are full
of them; they wear black Vails with which they

Grandees of <HI>Spain</HI> are of two &s;orts, this Ho|nour

The fir&s;t, the King bids be covered them|&s;elves;
the &s;econd, them&s;elves and Heirs for

Grandee, neither do any other priviledges be|long
to it; &s;o that it is but a Chimerical and Airy
Honour, without any profit; they which marry
the Heire&s;s of a Family of a Grandee of <HI>Spain,</HI>
that is &s;uch hereditarily, become Grandees in
right of their Wives.</P>
<P>This is all I could learn concerning Grandees,
but Spani&s;h Books mention three &s;orts, one of
which the King commands to be covered before
they &s;peak to him, another after they have &s;po|ken,
but before he an&s;wers; and the la&s;t cover
not, till they have &s;poken and he an&s;wered. When
the King creates a Duke, he is al&s;o a Grandee,
and the con&s;equence is good; he is a Duke,
therefore a Grandee; but not he is a Grandee,
therefore a Duke; many Marque&s;&s;es and Earls
being al&s;o Grandees. Their Wives &s;it in the
Queens pre&s;ence, and &s;he ri&s;es at their coming
in. The King in all Edicts and Letters calls them
Princes: In his Chappel, they have a Seat called
the Grandees Bench, where, without regard to
Antiquity, they &s;it as they come promi&s;cuou&s;ly.
The Title of <HI>Sennioria</HI> belongs to them by pa|tent
of <HI>Philip</HI> the Third. The&s;e are, in a man|ner,
all the advantages they have above other
Gentlemen, who, as well as they, are exempted
from all Taxes, unle&s;s when the Publick is in dan|ger;
at &s;uch times, they have been &s;o hea|vily
<PB N="39" REF="24">
burthen'd, that they have paid near half their
Revenue. They are not oblieged to quarter,
unle&s;s when the Court goes a Progre&s;s; but to
&s;peak in general of the Spani&s;h Nobility, they
have a very con&s;iderable priviledge (at lea&s;t if it
be made good to them) which is, that how great
&s;oever their Debts be, the Revenue only can be
attached, the re&s;t being in <HI>Mayorazgo</HI> (as I un|der&s;tand
it) entailed, which goes farther; &s;o
that when the Revenue is &s;eized on, the Judges
will appoint the Gentleman, who&s;e Quality ob|lieges
him to keep Servants, Hor&s;es, Coaches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
a Stipend &s;ufficient to &s;upport him according to
it; and though he owes as much as a Revenue of
50 thou&s;and Crowns can be worth, and hath but
30, his Creditors can pretend to no more, than
the overplus of what is ordered for his &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Here are very few Knights of the Golden

elde&s;t Son of the Emperour <HI>Ferdinand</HI> the
Third. The other Orders are <HI>Calatrava,</HI> known
by a Red Ro&s;e worn on the Cloak, and <HI>Alcanta|ra</HI>
by a green one, St. <HI>Jago</HI> wears a Sword gules
or an Arrow, the&s;e are near of an equal e&s;teem
and dignity; the&s;e Knights have &s;ometimes pro|fit
by the Commands they now and then obtain
by the Kings favour. A great number of them
were &s;lain before <HI>Lerida,</HI> &s;ince which time it is

<P>In the &s;econd Court of the Palace, are Cham|bers
for &s;everal Councils. The Council of State
a&s;&s;embles under the Kings Apartment, where the
welfare of all his Dominions is con&s;ulted. There
is al&s;o a Council of War, where the wayes of
executing what hath been re&s;olved in the Coun|cil
of State, are taken into con&s;ideration: Near
the&s;e is the Council of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> called <HI>Roial;</HI> it
is very powerful, and con&s;i&s;ts of Seventeen Coun|&s;ellors
and a Pre&s;ident. Many Affairs of the o|ther
Councils are referred hither, e&s;pecially of
the Council of the <HI>Indies,</HI> in which the people of
both <HI>Ca&s;tiles</HI> are very much concerned. <HI>Arra|gon</HI>
hath al&s;o its Council, <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Flanders</HI>
theirs. The Council for the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the Kings
Revenue called <HI>de la Hazienda,</HI> &s;its in another
place; &s;o doth that <HI>de las Ordenes,</HI> which deter|mines
the differences of the Orders of Knight|hood,
and Judges of the proofs of Gentry of
&s;uch as pretend to them. All the&s;e are within the
Palace Walls. That of the Inqui&s;ition hath its
Tribunal in the Hou&s;e of the Pre&s;ident of that
holy Office: That of the <HI>Cruzada,</HI> which gives
Di&s;pen&s;ations to eat Fle&s;h on Saturdayes, and
&s;ome other priviledges granted by Popes to the
King, is al&s;o held at the Pre&s;idents. None of
the&s;e pretend to be &s;o ab&s;olute, as the Inqui&s;ition.
I have been a&s;&s;ured, that it is not alwayes in the
Kings power to free tho&s;e that are accu&s;ed there:
<PB N="41" REF="25">
And though this Juri&s;diction derives its Authori|ty
from the Pope, in &s;ome Conjunctures it hath
had no regard to his Orders. It extends not on|ly
to tho&s;e which in matters of Religion go con|trary
to the Church, but is a &s;harp curb to all
who&s;e temper gives jealou&s;ie to the State, and di&s;|patches
them without noi&s;e, as was intended a|gain&s;t
<HI>Antonio Perez,</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Olivares,</HI>
had he not dyed. All re&s;olutions of the&s;e &s;everal
Councils, pa&s;s through that of State, before put
in execution, which examines whether there be
any thing in them, contrary to the general good
of all the members of the Crown.</P>
<P>A Mornings, becau&s;e then all the Councils a&s;|&s;emble,
there is a great crowd in the Palace, yet
only below in the two Courts, whither they
which have Bu&s;ine&s;s or Suits (as they &s;ay here,
<HI>para preten&s;iones)</HI> come to follow them. Among&s;t
others, you may &s;ee many undertakers of Levies
of Souldiers, &s;olliciting their Disbur&s;ments.
When Hor&s;e are rai&s;ed, all the Hor&s;es are
brought into the <HI>Piazza</HI> before the Palace,
where one Ear of each of them is cut off. By
this mark they are made known to be the Kings,
and a Trooper &s;elling one of them, or one of
them being &s;ound in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a man that
&s;erves not the King, he may be &s;eized, and carri|ed
away without any formality of Law; but the
Troopers &s;ometimes cut off the other Ear, and
then pre&s;enting the Captain &s;ome Dollars, ob|lieged
him to depo&s;e before the Commi&s;&s;ary, that

<P>The War here is more trouble&s;ome to the
King of <HI>Spain</HI> than any where el&s;e, and more
important, being in a part of his Dominion, of

by which it appears, that they which have con|cluded
the certain way of &s;haking the Spani&s;h
Monarchy, to be by making war upon it in its

for very &s;mall forces, becau&s;e in great want, not
only of Victual and Amunition, but much more

it otherwi&s;e in time of the <HI>Romans,</HI> who giving

that of Piety only. This alteration is ea&s;ily un|der&s;tood
by tho&s;e that con&s;ider, how the falling
of the <HI>Gothes</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> into this Country,
with the irruption of the <HI>Moors,</HI> that immedi|ately
followed it, &s;cattered the greate&s;t part of
the Inhabitants: and when the&s;e &s;trangers had
&s;o well &s;ettled them&s;elves, that the Cities again
abounded with people, <HI>Ferdinand</HI> of <HI>Arragon,</HI>
that conquered all <HI>Spain,</HI> de&s;troyed a great ma|ny,
and exiled more.</P>
<P>The di&s;covery of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> that hap|pened
&s;oon after, drew away great Colonies,

as well by the great concour&s;e of &s;uch as (finding
it a better Country than that they abandoned)
&s;eated them&s;elves there, as by a nece&s;&s;ity of fur|ni&s;hing
Navies, and tran&s;porting Soldiers to form

this in &s;uch manner, that the be&s;t of <HI>Spain</HI> is
now in the <HI>Indies,</HI> the Kings wants having ob|liged
him to &s;ell his Subjects for gold, though
neither the Mines of <HI>Poto&s;i,</HI> nor all <HI>Peru,</HI> are a|ble
to &s;upply the expence he is fain to be at for
want of men; neither do the Gallions ever bring
wealth enough to di&s;charge the States debts;
for be&s;ides that the greate&s;t part of it belongs to
<PB N="44" REF="27">
particular per&s;ons of <HI>Flanders, Holland, Genoua,</HI>
and <HI>France,</HI> that which comes on the Kings ac|count
is due to &s;everal that have a&s;&s;ignations up|on
it: So that <HI>Spain</HI> is no more than the chan|nel
by which the Gold of the <HI>Indies</HI> pa&s;&s;es to
di&s;charge it &s;elf in the va&s;t Ocean of other Coun|tries:
and therefore in that &s;imilitude, where
the world is compared to a living body, <HI>Spain</HI>
is the mouth, which receives, chaws, and pre|pares
the nouri&s;hment, but immediately con|veys
it to other parts, retaining nothing to it
&s;elf but the &s;avour alone, or the little that acci|dentally
&s;ticks between the teeth. And he had
rea&s;on, that con&s;idering <HI>Spain,</HI> where little Gold
appears, all other Nations abounding with her
Pi&s;tols, &s;aid &s;he &s;erves them as the <HI>Damnati ad
Metalla</HI> did the ancient Emperors; or el&s;e that
&s;he is like the A&s;s of <HI>Arcadia,</HI> that laden with
Gold, fed on thi&s;tles. But that which com|pleated
her de&s;olation, was the general expul|&s;ion
of the Moors. There were many
rea&s;ons for the quitting her &s;elf of &s;o cur&s;ed a
Generation, and impoi&s;oning the waters thereby
to de&s;troy all the Chri&s;tians, having been impu|ted
to them, and their continual corre&s;ponden|cies
with the <HI>Africans, Turks,</HI> and other Ene|mies
of the Kingdom di&s;covered, <HI>Philip</HI> the
third po&s;&s;ibly could not have taken a better re|&s;olution,
than at once to free him&s;elf from the
continual apprehen&s;ion of them: Though it may
well be objected, that a good Polititian ought
as little as may be to make u&s;e of &s;uch univer&s;al
puni&s;hments, by which a State is more enfeebled,
<PB N="45" REF="27">
than amended; and that when with the dagger
at the bre&s;t, we go about to free our &s;elves from
&s;ome ill we apprehend, we act rather as de&s;perate
then as couragious and prudent: that it is igno|rance
of lenitives that forces &s;o &s;oon to cut and
cauteri&s;e: That it is a greater vertue to in&s;truct
the vicious, and convert them, then to drive
them from their homes, and &s;hut the doors a|gain&s;t
them: In a word, that we may oppo&s;e er|rors
without de&s;troying per&s;ons. It is very cer|tain
that this Edict co&s;t the King of <HI>Spain</HI> a great
many rich and good Subjects, of no turbulent
principles, and that with time might have been
made &s;en&s;ible of the truth, and profe&s;&s;ion of
Chri&s;tianity. But they were altogether deprived
of the means of it; for if they embraced Chri&s;ti|anity,
d&s;&s;imulation was objected again&s;t them;
and that it was only to avoid the rigour of the
Edict. This gave opportunity to the avarice of
tho&s;e that executed it to play its game, pa&s;&s;ing
by without mole&s;tation &s;uch as bribed them,
and &s;uffering them to continue quiet in their
hou&s;es.</P>
<P>What di&s;cour&s;es &s;oever are made on this ex|traordinary
rigour, which &s;ome have admired
as a policy very high and generous, and others
blamed as a mo&s;t unnatural cruelty, it having
deprived a King of his Subjects, and almo&s;t a
Nation of its native Country: It is very certain,
that &s;ince that time <HI>Spain</HI> hath been a de&s;ert,
and could never recover the lo&s;s (as is reported)
of &s;ome millions of people: But be&s;ides this
her voluntary depopulating her &s;elf, the Indies
<PB N="46" REF="28">
prevailing either on the nece&s;&s;ity or inclination of
her Subjects, draw them &s;till away, by frequent
and numerous Colonies, in &s;uch manner that it
is believed more people have left <HI>Spain</HI> than at
pre&s;ent remain in it.</P>
<P>After the&s;e misfortunes (at fir&s;t looked on as
incomparable felicities by tho&s;e which boa&s;ted
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the We&s;t-Indies, and expul&s;ion
of the Moors) Wars aro&s;e, and &s;o violent, that it
is computed, that in twenty years they con&s;u|med
a million and a half of Inhabitants, and that
the Plague, which often afflicted this Country,
carried away near another million; &s;o that e|ver
&s;ince <HI>Philip</HI> the third, <HI>Spain</HI> hath extremely
wa&s;ted both in men and money: this is very
true, and in &s;o extraordinary a manner, that if
its Enemies had under&s;tood it, and tho&s;e that
were left behind had not after their &s;eparation
differed among&s;t them&s;elves, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would
have been altogether unable to have re&s;i&s;ted
them.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this great ambiguity of good or evil,
which they which judge according to the event
or their own &s;en&s;e, ob&s;erve in the di&s;covery of
the Indies, and expul&s;ion of the Moors, another
policy is &s;poken of, which not directed again&s;t
the Kingdom in general, attacques only that
part of it which is mo&s;t noble and illu&s;trous.
<HI>Philip</HI> the &s;econd, &s;tyled the <HI>Solomon</HI> of his age,
apprehending that the Grandees and Nobility
might at &s;ome time or other make u&s;e of their
wealth and power again&s;t his authority, or that
of his Succe&s;&s;ors; and remembring that they had
<PB N="47" REF="28">
di&s;covered their turbulent inclinations under
<HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, in &s;uch a manner, as had like
to have given him great troubles, thought he
could not better &s;ecure him&s;elf again&s;t &s;uch of
them as meant ill, than by the weakne&s;s of that
whole body; to which purpo&s;e he ca&s;t the &s;eeds
of vanity and envy among&s;t them, increa&s;ing
the number of Grandees, Dukes, Marqui&s;es, and
Earls. The &s;moke of this drove from their Fa|milies
all thoughts of profit, and their honours,
redoubled their expen&s;es, by every ones endea|vouring
to &s;urpa&s;s his Companion.</P>
<P>When he &s;aw them deeply engaged, he gave
way to attacquing their Lands, and deprived
them of the Priviledge of <HI>Mayora&s;go,</HI> the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable that belonged to them; and that
they might not have in their hands any places of
&s;trength, or hou&s;es to retire to when they had
a mind to be trouble&s;ome, he forbad them to
repair their Ca&s;tles: and &s;uch as have travailed

ancient Ca&s;tles advantagiou&s;ly &s;cituated for com|manding
the Country, that decay and fall to the
ground. Thus by heaping honours on them he
took away their power, and obliged them to a
greater charge; and by &s;paring them that of
keeping up their Ca&s;tles, deprived them of the
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and re&s;pect their Tenants formerly
had for them: Since this they have lo&s;t daily,
and complain that that Prince did not only clip, but
cut off the wings of their Predece&s;&s;ors, reducing
them to that incon&s;iderable condition they are
in at pre&s;ent; which, like original &s;un, &s;o clo&s;ely
<PB N="48" REF="29">
follows, that it de&s;troys &s;uch of them as find not
remedy, by obtaining &s;ome employment at a
di&s;tance from the Court, by means of which the

Then they neglect not to fill their baggs, and in|rich

in <HI>Madrid</HI> told us, that &s;ome few years
before, a Tax had been laid upon them, only
becau&s;e they were thought to be rich and at
their ea&s;e: The manner of doing it &s;eems very
&s;evere. A rich Merchant being &s;ent for to a
Committee of the Council, was told that the
King commanded him to bring three or four
thou&s;and crowns into his Exchequer; if he went
about to excu&s;e him&s;elf as unable, or by rea&s;on
of mony due to him from the King, it &s;ignified
nothing; and he was &s;ent away with notice, that
if he paid it not in three dayes he mu&s;t go &s;ix
leagues from <HI>Madrid</HI> in cu&s;tody of the Mini|&s;ters
of Ju&s;tice on his expence. That time ex|pired
without paying, he was &s;ent 20 leagues
from the Court. They which paid at fir&s;t freed
them&s;elves from this charge and trouble; they
that were ob&s;tinate again&s;t what appeared &s;o
unju&s;t to them, &s;uffered both, and were at la&s;t
con&s;trained to pay what had been impo&s;ed be|fore
they were permitted to return to their

<P>Gown-men and Pen-men are here the riche&s;t,

is not equal to what it hath been; for which (a|mong&s;t
many other pretended here) this rea&s;on
may be given, that the profit made on occa&s;ion
of it by the King and his Mini&s;ters hath di&s;cou|raged
Merchants, to the lo&s;s of a very great Re|venue
to the Crown: whatever is &s;hipped for
the <HI>Indies</HI> mu&s;t be regi&s;tred, and pay the tenth
penny for fault of which it is confi&s;cated. By
this the wealth of the Fleet is known to a far|thing,
as well what belongs to the King as to
particular per&s;ons. Some years &s;ince his Catho|lick
Maje&s;ty (wanting money) laid hands on that
which appertained to Merchants, under the no|tion
<PB N="51" REF="30">
indeed of borrowing, but (be&s;ides that &s;uch
forced lones &s;uit not well with Merchants affairs)
it was never returned: For which rea&s;on many
do not regi&s;ter their Gold and Silver, but chu&s;e
rather to combine with the Captains (though it
co&s;t them more) than to abandon all for fair
words. Before the Fleets arrival at Cadis, <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
or <HI>Holland</HI> Ships meet it either near that
Port, or that of <HI>St. Lucar,</HI> and receive there
from &s;uch Captains as they corre&s;pond with, that
which is on account of tho&s;e that &s;end them,
and carry it away before it enters any <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Haven; and even the Merchants of <HI>Sevil</HI> and
other <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Cities &s;end their money into tho&s;e
Countries, where they may freely di&s;po&s;e of it
without fear to have it &s;ei&s;ed on. It is &s;aid that
the Fleet comes this year more rich than u&s;ually;
but that the wealthie&s;t &s;hip is &s;tranded, and un|certain
whether the &s;ilver all &s;aved. But they
which will have nothing lo&s;t report that more
Gold and Silver hath been recovered than was
regi&s;tred, if &s;o the King will have the advantage
of it by confi&s;cation.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the general Government of
the&s;e Kingdoms, it &s;eems to move &s;o &s;teadily,
that it declines not at all from tho&s;e bold Poli|ticks
which are never di&s;turbed, and that trample
on the &s;harpe&s;t thorns as re&s;olutely as if they

differ about Seque&s;tration of the Goods of the
Genoue&s;es, &s;ome declaring it to have been ve|ry
ju&s;t and prudent; others the contrary: but all
agreeing, that having been &s;o vigorou&s;ly begun,
it ought to have been continued in the &s;ame
manner, and being an affair of reputation and
intere&s;t, that &s;o great a Monarch &s;hould not
have boggled at going through with it, or an
accommodation appearing nece&s;&s;ary, by rea&s;on
of the prejudice this Rupture gave to affairs,
they &s;hould not have moved &s;o heavily towards
it, becau&s;e in that interval they &s;uffered for
want of returns from <HI>Genoua,</HI> which during &s;uch
a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion they could not &s;upply with the Mo|ney
they had &s;ei&s;ed.</P>
<P>They which negotiated in this Court for that
Republick, endeavoured to make under&s;tood
that the Siege of <HI>Arras</HI> failed the year before,
becau&s;e the Merchants recalled the Bills of Ex|change
they had drawn on <HI>Antwerp;</HI> but the
Spani&s;h Mini&s;ters would not acknowledge this,
though it was evident they began to have &s;ome
light of it. In the mean time, punctilios only
&s;pan out a year before matters could be accom|moded,
though the Spaniards were no le&s;s de|&s;irous
of it then the Genoue&s;es; though the&s;e
many demurs had no other end but to &s;ave the
Spani&s;h reputation, they failed peradventure of
that effect; what had pa&s;&s;ed was nullified by the
agreement; what had been &s;ei&s;ed, relea&s;ed, and
the di&s;pute about <HI>Final,</HI> which had cau&s;ed it,
referred to arbitration.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="32">
They had long been agreed of all that was
&s;ub&s;tantial; but a punctilio of honour cau&s;ed
the execution to be delayed, it was this: The
Republick would not &s;et at liberty the pri&s;on|ers
taken before <HI>Finale,</HI> unle&s;s the King asked
them to do it, and the King would have them
&s;ent home before he made any propo&s;al: all
being like to break off an expedient, was found
(by means of Marquis <HI>Serra,</HI> brother of
him that commands in <HI>Catalonia)</HI> that the Am|ba&s;&s;ador
&s;hould vi&s;it the Earl of <HI>Ognate,</HI> and
ask him, if he thought the Republick might
oblige his Maje&s;ty by &s;etting the pri&s;oners at
liberty, and the other an&s;wering yes, all &s;hould
be ended; but they add, that this Earl, who
is both high and crafty, and that at his return
from <HI>Naples</HI> had been the fir&s;t cau&s;e of the mi&s;|under&s;tanding,
&s;oundly ratled the Amba&s;&s;ador:
In this proceeding, appears to me a very great
zeal in the Spani&s;h Mini&s;ters, in re&s;enting the
affront done them by the Republick, but it con|tinued
not, and the honour of it was blemi&s;h|ed
by u&s;ele&s;s delays, all at la&s;t being concluded
on conditions, that might have been obtained
at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The good under&s;tanding that hath continued &s;e|veral
years between the French and Genou&s;es,
cau&s;ed the fir&s;t of the&s;e to offer their a&s;&s;i&s;tance
to the other towards righting them again&s;t the
Spani&s;h violence; on account of which the
Republick held it &s;elf &s;o much obliged to the
French King, that it &s;ent <HI>Lazaro Spinola,</HI> a No|ble
Citizen, in Quality of Extraordinary Am|ba&s;&s;ador,
<PB N="55" REF="32">
to return thanks for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
and protection offered; that difference gave
the Genoue&s;es &s;uch di&s;ta&s;te of the Spani&s;h Al|liance,
that it moved them to do this to tho&s;e
they had formerly looked on as the greate&s;t
enemies of this liberty. If we except &s;uch in
<HI>Genoua</HI> as by Alliance and Intere&s;t are bound to
the Spani&s;h party, the re&s;t of their inclinations
are very contrary to what they were in their
Fathers days during the Reign of <HI>Francis</HI> the
I. of <HI>France,</HI> and the Genoue&s;es have at pre|&s;ent
no other kindne&s;s for the Spaniards, then
a Creditor for a Debtor, out of who&s;e hands
he would fain recover what belongs to him;
after which they would little value them: but
however the Genoue&s;es comport them&s;elves,
their patience will never oblige their debtors
to &s;atisfie them, who think they do enough
when they pay the intere&s;t without any longer
con&s;idering the principal, which the Spaniards
are well enough content to be thought unable
to di&s;charge, whether it be &s;o to free them|&s;elves
from being demanded it, or that the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of their affairs obliges them to it.</P>
<P>This in the mean time is a good caution to
the Genoue&s;es, by little and little to free them|&s;elves
from the Spani&s;h clutches. All &s;trangers,
what &s;ervices &s;oever they may have done them,
ought to fear them, they con&s;idering them&s;elves
and intere&s;ts only,, in &s;uch manner that the <HI>Ita|lians</HI>
and <HI>Flemings</HI> that are this Kings &s;ubjects,

engro&s;s all, as well to keep up the glory of the

they in a manner declare incapable of all tru&s;t
becau&s;e not born in <HI>Spain:</HI> this Countrey

Spani&s;h habit, and calling them&s;elves <HI>Burgun|dinians,
Walloons</HI> and <HI>Lorrainers,</HI> keep up Com|merce
and Manufacture; it concerns them to
conceal their Countrey, for if it be di&s;cover|ed,
they are obliged to pay a daily Pole-money
of about a penny to the Town, and, any bad
&s;ucce&s;s happening to the publick, appearing in
the &s;treets, are liable to a thou&s;and in&s;olencies,

to appear &s;uch, immediately &s;olicite &s;tran|gers
to quit the habit of their Countrey, which
cau&s;es them to be the more ob&s;erved when
they make their vi&s;its. The Spaniards wear a
Ca&s;&s;ock with deep skirts which &s;its very clo&s;e to
the body from the neck to the hanches, a black
leather Girdle, which buckles on the Brea&s;t,
or toward the Navil; their Breeches are &s;o
&s;treight, that for more ea&s;ie putting them on
and off, they are buttoned at the &s;ides towards
the bottom; their &s;hooes are &s;haped exactly to
their feet, with narrow &s;oles; and a little Foot
and large calf of the leg, are in &s;uch reque&s;t,
that Gallants bind their feet about with Riband,
to their no &s;mall torment, whil&s;t by quilted
&s;tockins they put them&s;elves perfectly in the
mode: their &s;ilk &s;tockins are knit very open,
almo&s;t like Net-work, which they &s;tretch very
&s;treight upon white, that is &s;een through them;
they wear no longer broad brimmed Hats, but
very narrow ones lined with Taffata; they
e&s;teem it very gallant, and of more then ordi|nary
magnificence, to wear Hatbands of many
broad black Bone-laces, which doubtle&s;ly co&s;t
as much as Plumes, they &s;ending for them to
<HI>France</HI> or <HI>Flanders:</HI> they are not curious in
their Linnen, u&s;ing little Bonelace on it.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on of their beginning to dre&s;s them|&s;elves

is not to be contrary to other nations in all

<P>The fir&s;t of <HI>May</HI> we &s;aw the Tour of Coaches

Mules fa&s;tened by long Harne&s;s; &s;uch as
have &s;ix Mules, you may conclude belong to
per&s;ons very eminent, who are not allowed this
Magnificence but without the Town, which
prohibition was occa&s;ioned by the Kings being
told that the Tour was little frequented, by rea|&s;on
of the vanity of &s;uch as unable to appear

&s;eem le&s;s then tho&s;e with whom they pretend
equality.</P>
<P>No Coachman &s;its before the Coach, but on
one of the foremo&s;t Mules; this having been
forbidden by the Conde Duke, who had a &s;e|cret
revealed by the Coachman: they almo&s;t
all u&s;e Mules, &s;ince the Coach-hor&s;es were ei|ther
effectually taken away, or threatened to
be &s;ent into <HI>Catalonia.</HI> The breed of hor&s;es is

not done to prevent it, <HI>Spain</HI> will be entirely
disfurni&s;hed, the greate&s;t part of Mares being
re&s;erved to bear Mules, the profit of them be|ing
great by rea&s;on of a quick and advanta|gious
Market. The King of <HI>Portugal</HI> hath re|medied
this, by forbidding the u&s;e of Mules,
and the Clergy refu&s;ing to obey under pre|tence
of certain priviledges, he gave them ex|emption,

end of it.</P>
<P>Part of their liberty, or rather licentiou&s;ne&s;s
con&s;i&s;ts in an indifferent demanding of any to
pay for Lemons, Wafers, Sweet-meats or Per|fumes,

&s;old; they give intimation of this by tho&s;e

being di&s;patched in little more then three hours;
but I could never apprehend what plea&s;ure he
can take at the Tour, &s;ince as he pa&s;&s;es by, all
Curtains out of re&s;pect, are drawn, &s;o that he
&s;ees nothing but the Coaches, though the de|&s;ign
of it is only to appear with &s;plendor, and
enjoy the view of all that is gallant: Re&s;pect
here que&s;tionle&s;s de&s;troys the plea&s;ure it aug|ments
in other Countreys, where at the Prin|ces
approach, all make a &s;tand, and Women un|mask,</P>
<P>The 5th of <HI>May</HI> we went to <HI>Aranjuez</HI> to
&s;ee the Court; this plea&s;ant &s;eat where the
King every Spring re&s;ides a moneth, is cer|tainly
very agreeable, and the Spaniards that &s;ee
nothing equal to it, mention it no otherwi&s;e
then as the <HI>Eli&s;ian fields:</HI> their Poets call it the
Metropolis of <HI>Floras</HI> Kingdom, and her Trea|&s;ury;
in the way to it we pa&s;&s;ed the River
<HI>Tagus</HI> by a wooden Bridge, which hath a Gate
at one end of it, that is &s;hut when the Court
<PB N="62" REF="36">
is not there, then people Ferry over, paying
&s;ome Duties, which are part of the Rents of
<HI>Aranjuez.</HI> The fir&s;t thing pre&s;ents it &s;elf is a
Park with Earthen walls, called <HI>Tapia,</HI> it is
large, and beautified by divers Allies; in the
Heath on each &s;ide the pa&s;&s;age to it, are Cony-Warrens:
by the Park &s;ide is a very large
Walk, from which &s;everal others like it; ex|tend
to the right and left, it leads to a Gate
at the end of a bridge over a Canal, drawn
thither from the River; this forms an I&s;land
in which the Garden is, very fair and neatly
kept, its entrance is from the Palace, and as &s;oon
as the Bridge is pa&s;&s;ed, two Statues of Bra&s;s
appear, from the cut off Arms of one of which,
water di&s;tils; hard by the&s;e is the Ci&s;tern of
the Fountain of <HI>Diana,</HI> which &s;tands in the
middle of a Mount rai&s;ed of Stone, Wood,
Mo&s;s and Earth; many Figures of &s;everal Crea|tures
are joyned to it, who plea&s;antly &s;pout out
water as they receive it by Pipes from the River;
in all this Garden I &s;aw not any Fountain that
derives its &s;tream from a Spring; round about
the Ci&s;tern &s;tand Eight Ships (if I mi&s;take not)
of Mirtle, who&s;e Branches are &s;o accommoda|ted,
that the poops, prows, and all the re&s;t of
the hulks are well &s;haped; on each of the&s;e is
a little Statue that &s;pouts water again&s;t the
Bea&s;ts that are on the top of the Mount. We
came next to the Fountain of <HI>Ganimed,</HI> who
is mounted on an Eagle at the top of a Pillar;
at the Ci&s;tern &s;ide &s;tand <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Hercules;</HI> a
little from it is the Fountain of the <HI>Gelo&s;ia,</HI> or
<PB N="63" REF="36">
&s;mall Lattice, &s;o called, becau&s;e at the top of it,
the water repre&s;ents the form of one of tho&s;e
Lattices or Gelo&s;ias that are u&s;ually &s;et before
windows: neer it is another, called the Gold|en
Rowel; and at the entrance of the middle
Ally, that of the Harpies, the faire&s;t of all; its
Ci&s;tern is &s;quare, and at the four corners on
four Pillars, &s;tand tho&s;e mon&s;trous Creatures,
vomiting water again&s;t the &s;tatue of a man,
that &s;itting on one of the middle Columns, &s;eeks
a thorn in the &s;ole of his foot: in the &s;ame
Ally not far from the end of the Garden is the
Fountain of Don <HI>John of Au&s;tria,</HI> who&s;e Sta|tue
is placed on the top of it, water di&s;tilling
from his hair; it is made of a &s;tone that was
found in a Turki&s;h &s;hip after the battle of <HI>Le|panto,</HI>
it hath two Ci&s;terns, and below four
<HI>Cupids</HI> with &s;everal Emblems: this Garden is
very plea&s;ant, as well in it &s;elf, as by rea&s;on of
its particular ornaments which are not yet equal|ly
taking; the Walks are almo&s;t all too narrow,
and one would think they had been niggards
of ground for the parterres; the Arbors are
low, and upheld only with Laths in&s;tead of
Deal &s;pars, which would not have been &s;pared
by a rich private per&s;on; round about the I&s;le
by the River and Canals &s;ide is a large Walk,
well kept and &s;wept, &s;haded by tall Elms;
this is the faire&s;t, and in which their Maje&s;ties
mo&s;t delight, in it is one Arbor, looking into
the highway of <HI>Madrid,</HI> in which the Queen
was the day the Bulls were fought, to &s;ee them
pa&s;s by, after the King and his Court had
<PB N="64" REF="37">
brought them from the Heard from which they
had &s;eparated them: the day of this &s;port is
made a great &s;ecret, the King never declaring
it till the night before he &s;ends away the <HI>Her|radores,</HI>
or markers of the Bulls, then al&s;o giving
notice to the countrey people to bring them in:
we had the fir&s;t news of it in the great walk, of
which I will &s;peak anon, where we met the Queen
going to take the Air; as &s;oon as her Coach and
that of her Maids of Honour were pa&s;&s;ed by, a
man on hor&s;eback, &s;aid to be the Guardian or o|ver&s;eer
of that Sex, taking us for Dutchmen, cal|ling
to us told us, that one of tho&s;e Ladys or Maids
of Honour had a Cou&s;en married in the <HI>Low-Countreys,</HI>
and would be glad to enquire of him,
we turned back and after &s;ome &s;hort di&s;cour&s;e,
&s;he acquainted us, that po&s;&s;ibly the &s;ight of
Bulls might be the next day, not daring po&s;i|tively
to declare it: this caution is to prevent
too great a concour&s;e: immediately the Ladies
Guardian interrupted our &s;mall entertainment,
bidding us go off from the Coach, having talk|ed
long enough with the Ladies&punc; we returned,
admiring no le&s;s his incivility, then the imperti|nence
of the Queens Buffoon, pre&s;enting one of
us a pipe of Tinn to &s;peak to him with, be|cau&s;e
deaf as he feigned; this great Walk is
beyond the Village of <HI>Aranjuez,</HI> &s;o wretched,
it &s;carcely affords any lodging, &s;o that at our
arrival there we were fain to go farther, and
though the Moon &s;hone, and we had guides,
lo&s;t our way; in the place where we &s;tayed
we had much ado to get Stable-room for our
<PB N="65" REF="37">
Hor&s;es, and &s;helter for our &s;elves, and were
very well contented to &s;leep on Chairs and
Benches. This is not occa&s;ion'd by rea&s;on of
a great Court, for almo&s;t all the Officers are
lodged in the Kings hou&s;e, though very &s;mall;
but the Village affords but one Inn, which was
taken up by the Emperours Amba&s;&s;adors, &s;o
that we could have no place there till next
morning. That day we re&s;olved to make an
end of &s;eeing <HI>Aranjuez,</HI> and when we had
been where the Camels are kept, where there
was only one Female, and a young one, the
re&s;t being abroad to carry wood, as we return|ed
by &s;everal f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ir Allies, our guide told us, that
after a birth the Females are two years before
they again bring forth: He &s;aid al&s;o, that they
&s;ometimes bait them with Dogs, and that it is
very plea&s;ant to &s;ee how dexterou&s;ly tho&s;e ill
&s;haped creatures defend them&s;elves again&s;t Ma|&s;tiffs;
and that their fury &s;ometimes break
through the Rails and di&s;charges it &s;elf on the
Spectatators: coming near our lodging, he
mentioned a rare Waterwork with &s;o many cir|cum&s;tances,
that he incited our curio&s;ity to go
and &s;ee it, by we di&s;covered his &s;implicity, it
being nothing but a Mill to &s;aw boards. This
confirmed our opinion that what is very com|mon
in other places, pa&s;&s;es often here for mi|raculous:
in the afternoon we went to &s;ee the
great and magnificent Walk at the end of the
Village, neer the way to <HI>Alcala de Henares:</HI>
on each &s;ide it is a double row of fair young
Elms, towards who&s;e better growth, they can
<PB N="66" REF="38">
at plea&s;ure let in water between the ranks: it
is very long and large, and in two or three
places are wide circles where Coaches may
wheel about as at our Tour in <HI>Hidepark:</HI> at the
end of it is a bridge over <HI>Tagus</HI> with a door, in
&s;uch manner, that the King when at <HI>Aran|juez,</HI>
either without Guards, or only with 10
or 12 Halberdiers, is as within an entrench|ment,
not to be pa&s;&s;ed but by the&s;e bridges;
on the right hand is another Walk leading to
a Grange where three A&s;&s;es are kept to cover
Mares for production of good Mules; in my
life I never &s;aw any &s;o big, the younge&s;t being
as high as any Mule, the two other not much
lower; the Fir&s;t co&s;t Two and twenty thou|&s;and
Reals, which amounts to <HI>600 l. &s;terling;</HI>
they are exempted from Duty but two days
in the year, that is, on <HI>Corpus Chri&s;ti,</HI> and the
<HI>Fea&s;t of the A&s;cen&s;ion;</HI> at other times, as we
were told, the Male Care&s;&s;es the Female twice
a day, by this appears that mo&s;t of the Mares be|ing
made u&s;e of to bear Mules, the breed of
Hor&s;es will by degrees be lo&s;t here, and they
would have much ado to rai&s;e Cavalry, were
there occa&s;ion for it. Rumours have been &s;pred
that Mules &s;hould be prohibited, but this was
found difficult; I know not whether by means
of the Clergy, if &s;o, it had been ea&s;ie to have
applied the remedy made u&s;e of by the King
of <HI>Portugal;</HI> Though above the folly of tho&s;e
Travailers, that mind no more of the Courts of
the Countreys they pa&s;s thorow, then to &s;ee
the Princes Diss or Ride. Our little &s;tay in
<PB N="67" REF="38">
<HI>Spain,</HI> and difficult acce&s;s to the Court, by rea|&s;on
of its great privacy, obliged us to amu&s;e
our &s;elves with what takes the eyes, but little
&s;atisfies the intellect. On <HI>A&s;cention day</HI> by means
of Sir <HI>Benjamin Wright,</HI> we were permitted to
&s;tand in a corner of the chamber where the
Queen dined; &s;he is of a middle &s;tature, ra|ther
inclining to be low; over again&s;t her &s;tands
a Lady that pre&s;ents the di&s;hes, and doth the
Office of Carver; on each &s;ide of her &s;tands
another; &s;he on the right, pre&s;ents the
Gla&s;s, &s;he on the left, the Napkin; &s;he drinks
very little, but eats well; &s;he was &s;erved with
many di&s;hes, but as we thought, few good ones;
&s;he hath a Buffoon that talks continually to en|deavour
to divert her; four or five youths of
the be&s;t families in <HI>Spain</HI> bring in the meat out
of the next chamber, the&s;e are called <HI>Meni|nos,</HI>
all habited in Gray, yet with difference
in the Colour: we wondred to &s;ee the Spani&s;h
gravity &s;uffer &s;uch neglect of Maje&s;ty; the&s;e
<HI>Meninos</HI> u&s;ing very little re&s;pect in the Queens
pre&s;ence, they often prated and &s;hared a di&s;h
of Apples with the Buffoon, and &s;ome of them
at the door pu&s;hing one another, made a great
noi&s;e, without any reprehending them; none
are admitted to &s;ee the Infanta dine, and up|on
our expre&s;&s;ing a curio&s;ity for it, it was ru|moured
that the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> was <HI>incognito</HI>
at <HI>Aranjuez:</HI> an hone&s;t Spaniard after the fight
of Bulls, brought me into a Garden where I
&s;aw her take Coach: &s;he is low, of a &s;prightly
meen and quick eye, her face rather long
<PB N="68" REF="39">
then round. It is pity the cu&s;tom of the Coun|trey
obliges her to paint, for with le&s;s red &s;he
would certainly appear more lovely, though
the Queen and &s;he &s;eem le&s;s inflamed then the
re&s;t of the Court, who&s;e cheeks are Scarlet, and
that &s;o gro&s;ly laid on, it &s;eems rather to aim
at di&s;gui&s;e then beauty; and indeed the mo&s;t of
them are &s;o ill favoured, that all the paint in
the world made u&s;e of with the greate&s;t Art, can|not
help them. The Maids of Honour take
the fir&s;t three or four Coaches: and the Due|nas:
(who are old Women clothed in white,
and almo&s;t covered with Vails) the la&s;t; the
Queen and Infanta follow in a Coach with &s;ix
Hor&s;es, an old Lady &s;itting in the Boot; their
wide Farthingales extreamly fill the Coach, and
one would take their thick and knotty Elflocks
for Hempen &s;tuffing, broke out of an old pack-&s;addle.</P>
<P>Their Whisks or rather Cravats are made of
great points, which doubtle&s;ly co&s;t a great
deal, though unhand&s;ome: almo&s;t all of them
have Looking-gla&s;&s;es, Watches or Pictures
hanging at their Girdles; I &s;aw none Court them
but the Marquis of <HI>Aytona,</HI> who walked by a
Coach &s;ide talking with one that &s;ate in the
boot; but I was told this is done with freedom
enough in the Queens withdrawing room; and
when&s;oever they appear at windows by &s;igns
agreed on between them and their &s;ervants in
order to &s;o gallant a conver&s;ation. When
they marry, the Queen adds Fifty thou&s;and
Crowns to their portions, which are very will
<PB N="69" REF="39">
paid; be&s;ides the&s;e Ladies and &s;ome Querries,
the Queen hath no attendance at her going
abroad but her Buffoon, with &s;ome mean Offi|cers
and Footmen: &s;he hath no Guards, and
I admired her being publick with &s;o little &s;tate.
The King hath about a dozen Firelocks that wait
daily at his Stair-head; the&s;e are either <HI>Fle|mings</HI>
or <HI>Burgundians,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Arcos</HI> is their
Captain. On the Guard they wear the Kings
Livery (which at other times they lay a&s;ide)
and an odd Kind of Sword or Hanger called
<HI>Cuchilla:</HI> They are in all 150. There wait al&s;o dai|ly
&s;ixteen <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> and as many <HI>High-Dutch</HI> Hal|bardiers.
This Guard was fir&s;t introduced in <HI>Spain</HI>
by the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria:</HI> and we were told there
are be&s;ides the&s;e two old Companies of <HI>Spaniards</HI>
formerly the Guards of the Kings of <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI>
which are but ill payed, and the re&s;t not much
better. The morrow after A&s;cention day <HI>Dom
Lewis de Haro</HI> arrived, the King having &s;ent
for him to the Solemnity of the <HI>Herradura</HI> or
marking of Bulls: a little after which his Maje&s;ty
took hor&s;e at the point of the I&s;land of the Gar|den,
and having commanded the people to go
without the rails, went with all his Court to the
end of a great Alley, to drive the Bulls into that
part of the field that is inclo&s;ed: Men on hor&s;e|back
with great cudgels enrage them, whil&s;t o|thers
behind drive them forward with &s;houts
and blows. Then comes the King with his Court,
and the &s;port is at an end.</P>
<P>Their Maje&s;ties having heard Ma&s;s, the Go|vernor
of <HI>Aranjuez,</HI> the be&s;t Torreador, that
<PB N="70" REF="40">
is Champion again&s;t Bulls, of all <HI>Spain,</HI> begins
the &s;econd hunting of the&s;e bea&s;ts, to drive them
into the innermo&s;t partition, where they are to
be marked with a hot iron: There they remain
till 3. in the afternoon, at which time all Win|dows
and Scaffolds abounding with Spectators,
their Maje&s;ties take their &s;eat, and give order
to begin: within the Barricadoes &s;tand &s;everal
young Country fellows (whom they call Her|radors)
expecting the Bulls to grapple with them,
and two or three being let loo&s;e, the brave&s;t
run and &s;ei&s;e their horns, or tails, and &s;econded
by the re&s;t endeavour to ca&s;t them on the
ground, whil&s;t others with hot irons mark them
on the thighs, &s;ome the mean while &s;litting
their ears. Much agility is nece&s;&s;ary in this acti|on,
as well in performing it as afterwards, the
Bulls being very furious. To deceive them, the
a&s;&s;ailants pre&s;ent each a Cloak or Hat, and the
Bea&s;t &s;hutting his eyes when he gores, one of
the bolde&s;t leaps upon his neck, and catches
hold of his horns, the re&s;t doing the like to &s;uch
other parts as they can light on, but he over|throws
and hurts many, and it is &s;trange that
he kills not the mo&s;t, for oftentimes running
right upon them, he ca&s;ts them down and pa&s;|&s;es
over them, but tho&s;e one would think dead
(I know not how) &s;odainly ri&s;e again. They are
indeed very nimble in avoiding their horns,
and ready in falling to let them go by. This
&s;port may be very plea&s;ant, but not to the act|ors,
and I admire &s;o great a King vouch&s;afes
to look on it, and conceive he does it ra|ther
<PB N="71" REF="40">
out of policy to comply with the cu&s;tom,
then invited by any delight, he takes in it; but
that &s;omething extraordinary might be done
for his diver&s;ion; <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> cau&s;ed his
Fool or Buffoon to enter the Li&s;ts, who clad in
all manner of colours, and mounted on a white
Steed, was with it to&s;&s;ed into the Air, and af|terwards
trampled on the ground: Twenty two
or twenty three of the Bulls were marked, which
will be made u&s;e of at the Fe&s;tivals of <HI>Ma|drid,</HI>
among&s;t which we hope to &s;ee that of
<HI>St I&s;adore,</HI> the Patron of the Town.</P>
<P>A while after we went to the E&s;curial,
which to give it no le&s;s then its due, may in
<HI>Spain</HI> pa&s;s for an admirable Structure, but where
building is under&s;tood, would not be looked
on as very extraordinary. In a general con&s;i|deration,
it &s;eems a ma&s;s of &s;tone of great per|fection,
but going to particulars, &s;carce any of
them but falls very &s;hort of the Magnificence
imagined, and that &s;o much, that if <HI>Philip</HI> the
Second who built it, and was called the <HI>Solomon</HI>
of his age, did no more re&s;emble that wi&s;e King
then this edifice does his Temple, to which it is
often compared; the copy comes very &s;hort of the
Original: in the mean time to &s;tretch the com|pari&s;on
they plea&s;e them&s;elves in &s;aying, that
<HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth like another <HI>David</HI> only de|&s;igned
this Holy work, which (being a
man of war and blood) God re&s;erved for his
Son. Ignorant &s;trangers are entertained with
this tale, but &s;uch as are ver&s;ed in Hi&s;tory tell
us, that after the battle of <HI>St Quentin, Philip</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="41">
the Second made two vows, one never to go in
per&s;on to the wars, the other to build this Cloy|&s;ter
for the Order of <HI>St Hierom</HI> in&s;tead of that
which had been burnt, it co&s;t him neer &s;ix Mi|lions
of Gold, though out of con&s;ideration of
par&s;imony and convenience of bringing &s;tone,
he made choice of the wor&s;t &s;cituation in na|ture,
for it is at the foot of a barren Moun|tain,
and hard by a wretched Village called
<HI>E&s;curial,</HI> that can hardly lodge a man of any
fa&s;hion; this may &s;eem very &s;trange to tho&s;e
that know the Court is there twice in a year:
the place it &s;tands on, is by tran&s;cendence called
the Seat, becau&s;e it was levelled in order to
build on.</P>
<P>The Fabrick is very fair, with four Towers
at the four corners, but coming to it, one knows
not which way to enter, for as &s;oon as out of
the great Walk, in a kind of Piazza, you &s;ee on|ly
little doors, which when you are over it,
lead into two Pavilions that contain Offices and
Lodgings for &s;ome of the Court; when you
have well viewed this &s;ide of the &s;quare, you
come to that which is towards the Mountain,
where is a very large Magnificent Portal, on
each &s;ide beautify'd with Pillars; by this &s;tate|ly
Gate you enter a Quadrangle, where right
over again&s;t it &s;tands the Church, a&s;cended to
it by a Stair of five or &s;ix &s;teps, as long as the
Court is large, extending from one &s;ide of it to
the other: very fair Columnes &s;upport the
Porch, and on the top of the wall &s;tand &s;ix
Statues, the middlemo&s;t of which are <HI>David</HI>
<PB N="73" REF="41">
and <HI>Solomon,</HI> by whom they would repre&s;ent
<HI>Charles</HI> the Fifth, and <HI>Philip</HI> the Second. About
the Church are many Pavillions, all compre|hended
in the exact &s;quare which environs that
building. Report mentions many Ba&s;courts, but
we could not reckon above 7 or 8. That this
is a very fair Cloy&s;ter for Friers cannot be de|nied,
neither can it be allowed to be a Pal|lace
Magnificent enough for &s;uch a Monarch as
<HI>Philip</HI> the Second, who having built it in One
and twenty years, and enjoyed it Twelve or
Thirteen, boa&s;ted, that from the foot of a
Mountain and his Clo&s;et, with two inches of
Paper, he made him&s;elf obeyd in the old and
new world.</P>
<P>The King and Queens apartment have no|thing
in them that appears Roial, they are al|together
unfurni&s;hed, and they &s;ay, when the
King goes to any of his hou&s;es of plea&s;ure,
they remove all to the very Bed&s;teds: the rooms
are little and low; the Roofs not beautiful e|nough
to invite the eyes to look up to them:
its many pictures of excellent Ma&s;ters, and e&s;pe|cially
of <HI>Titian,</HI> that wrought a great while
there, are very much vanted, yet there are not
&s;o many as report gives out. The Spaniards have
&s;o little under&s;tanding of pictures, they are
alike taken with all, and the Marquis <HI>Serra</HI> a Ge|noue&s;e
that accompanied us &s;ufficiently, laugh|ed
at the fooli&s;hne&s;s of a <HI>Ca&s;tillian,</HI> who wil|ling
to have us admire the &s;lighte&s;t and wretch|ed&s;t
Landskips of a Gallery where we were,
told us nothing could equalize them, becau&s;e
<PB N="74" REF="42">
in a place where their King &s;ometimes walked.
There are yet in the ve&s;try &s;ome good pieces,
e&s;pecially a <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Mary Magdalen;</HI> and
in the Church, others very e&s;timable. For paint|ings
in <HI>Fre&s;co,</HI> the Quire done by <HI>Titian</HI> is doubt|le&s;ly
an excellent work, and &s;o is the Library,
I think by the &s;ame hand, where among&s;t the
re&s;t is repre&s;ented the antient Roman manner
of defending Criminals, who &s;tand by bound
hand and foot; <HI>Cicero</HI> is al&s;o there pleading for
<HI>Milo,</HI> or &s;ome other, I not being &s;ufficiently ac|quainted
with his meen, to be po&s;itive and with|out
apprehen&s;ion of mi&s;taking: this Library is
truly very con&s;iderable, as well for its length,
breadth, height and light; the Pictures and Mar|ble
Tables that &s;tand in the mid&s;t of it; as for
its quantity of choice and rare Books, if we may
beleeve the Monks; they are certainly very
well bound and guilded, and if I mi&s;take not,
but &s;eldom read. In the Ve&s;try they &s;hew Prie&s;ts
Copes, where embroidery and Pearl with emu|lation
contend, whither Art or Matter renders
them more rich and &s;umptuous; they &s;hewed
us a Cro&s;s of very fair Pearl, Diamonds, and
Emeralds; it is a very pretty knack, and would
not become le&s;s &s;uch if it changed Countreys;
I would willingly have undertaken for it if they
would have &s;uffered it to pa&s;s the <HI>Pyreneans,</HI>
had it been only to &s;hew my friends a hun|dred
thou&s;and Crowns in a Nut&s;hel. The Libra|ry
I have &s;poken of; the high Altar and Mo|nument
of their Kings, which they call <HI>Pan|theon</HI>
(though I know not why, unle&s;s becau&s;e
<PB N="75" REF="42">
a &s;ingle round Arch like the Pantheon at <HI>Rome)</HI>
are certainly the be&s;t pieces of this Magnificent
Fabrick. The high Altar is approached by &s;teps
of Red Marble, and invironed by Sixteen pil|lars
of Ja&s;per, which reach the top of the Quire,
and co&s;t only a matter of 50 or 60 thou&s;and
Crowns cutting, between the&s;e are Niches with
Statues of guilded Bra&s;s, and &s;o there are on
the &s;ide of the Tables, and Praying places&punc;
the Pantheon is under the Altar, and de&s;cended
by &s;tairs, though narrow, very light; at the en|trance
of this rich Chappel, a Marble &s;hines,
who&s;e lu&s;ter is heightned by reflexion of the
Gold, with which, all the iron work and part
of that fair &s;tone are overlaid: In the middle
of it, and right again&s;t the Altar is a fair Can|dle&s;tick
of Bra&s;s, guilded, and in &s;ix &s;everal
niches, 24 Sepulchres of black Marble to re|ceive
as many bodies: above the Gate are two
more. This &s;tately monument is &s;mall, but
&s;umptuous, it was fini&s;hed by the pre&s;ent King,
who about &s;ix months &s;ince placed there the
bodies of <HI>Charles</HI> the V, <HI>Philip</HI> the II, and <HI>Philip</HI>
the III. The fir&s;t was mo&s;t intire; in the niches
on the left, lie the Queens, and the la&s;t of them
Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> of <HI>Burbon.</HI> He that preached
the day that the&s;e &s;even Tombs or Sepulchres
had bodies laid in them, began by his appre|hen&s;ion
to &s;peak in pre&s;ence of &s;o many Kings
who had conquered the world, and expre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf &s;o well, and &s;o highly plea&s;ed the King
that he got a yearly pen&s;ion of a thou&s;and
Crowns. Nothing attaining &s;uch perfection as
<PB N="76" REF="43">
to &s;ecure it from the Teeth of Criticks, the
three pieces I have now mentioned, have been
attacqued by them. It is objected again&s;t the
Library, that its entrance &s;uits not with its Mag|nificence
and Grandeur, and that it &s;tands as if
&s;toln in, and not of the &s;ame piece with the
re&s;t.</P>
<P>Over again&s;t the great Altar, where all is &s;o
well proportioned, they wi&s;h away a &s;ilver
Lamp, who&s;e &s;ize corre&s;ponds not with that of
the place it burns in, which is va&s;t and large.
In the Pantheon they find great fault, that all
the &s;teps by which it is de&s;cended are not Mar|ble,
and that the &s;ides of the walls are not in|cru&s;ted
with it, the Chappel being all &s;o, and a
like Magnificence requi&s;ite every where: In the
brazen Candle&s;tick, the inner part which is not
guilded is di&s;cerned among&s;t the black and foul
branches that extend from it. It co&s;t 10 thou|&s;and
Crowns, which is ten times more then it is
worth; but it is common in this Countrey to
boa&s;t things of exce&s;&s;ive price, which they
would have admired on that account, as if be|cau&s;e
they are fooli&s;h Merchants, the ware
they buy too dear, were therefore the more va|luable.
The&s;e are my ob&s;ervations of the &s;o fa|mous
E&s;curial, adorned only by &s;ome &s;mal Par|terras
and Fountains; one &s;ide of it affords a
hand&s;ome pro&s;pect, but the ground near it is the
greate&s;t part Rock or Heath; &s;ome Walks and
Groves are planted about it, but being cold
and windy, trees thrive not. There are &s;ome
Deer in a kind of Park, ill de&s;igned, and with
<PB N="77" REF="43">
very low walls; the way to it is nothing plea|&s;ant,
and the King who goes thither thrice every
year, one of which times is in the Winter, can|not
certainly find any great diver&s;ion in tho&s;e
journeys, for during three months, all is cover|ed
with &s;now. I have no more to &s;ay of the&s;e
two wonders of the world, <HI>The E&s;curial for Art,
and</HI> Aranjuez <HI>for Nature, The paralels of the
Son of</HI> Au&s;tria, (as is here &s;aid,) <HI>according to
times and fancies.</HI></P>
<P>The Twentieth of this month, all <HI>Madrid</HI>
a&s;&s;embled in the great Piazza to &s;ee the Bulls
fought; they mention this &s;olemnity &s;o ad|vantagiou&s;ly,
as if it were to be compared to
the Noble&s;t Spectacles of the antients: every
Town of <HI>Spain</HI> hath &s;everal days &s;et apart for
it, and not any one of them but enjoys this
plea&s;ure about Mid&s;ummer. The people have &s;o
great an e&s;teem for it, that they think you ex|treamly
injure them if you prefer it not to all
others, and if you &s;eem not to admire all its cir|cum&s;tances,
you may as &s;afely deny their King
to be the greate&s;t in the world.</P>
<P>The pro&s;pect of the Piazza this day mu&s;t needs
be very agreeable: People of the be&s;t quality adorn
all the Windows and Balconies, hung with Silks
and Tape&s;trys of divers colours, with the great|e&s;t
o&s;tentation po&s;&s;ible: Each Council hath
its Balcony hung with Velvet or Damask, with
a Scutcheon of the Arms belonging to it. The
Kings is guilded, and under a State; the Queen
and Infanta &s;it by him, and the Favorite or
chief Mini&s;ter in a corner of it; on his right
<PB N="78" REF="44">
hand is another great Balcony for the Ladies of
the Court, the re&s;t are promi&s;cuou&s;ly taken up
by others. Both men and women &s;et out them|&s;elves
to all advantage po&s;&s;ible, paying very dear
for the Balconies; tho&s;e on the fir&s;t and &s;econd
&s;tories co&s;t Twenty or five and Twenty Crowns,
though the fir&s;t rank cannot contain above
five or &s;ix per&s;ons: the King pays for tho&s;e of
&s;uch as are con&s;iderable to him, as Amba&s;|&s;adors
and Envoies of forreign Princes. Be|fore
the Balconies are Scaffolds that extend &s;ome
feet into the Piazza; they are extreamly croud|ed,
all the people taking places dearer or cheap|er
according to the po&s;ts they make choice
of.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e &s;olemnities are very frequent,
three or four being yearly celebrated in <HI>Ma|drid,</HI>
the meane&s;t Citizen will not once neglect
to &s;ee them, and rather pawn his Goods then
fail for want of Money. This takes its name
of di&s;tinction from <HI>St I&s;idore,</HI> protector of the
Town, which therefore bears the charge; the
rea&s;on it pa&s;&s;es not for a Royal Spectacle; it
co&s;ts the King neverthele&s;s &s;omething, and I
was told, he gives every Council that day Three
thou&s;and Crowns: tho&s;e at <HI>Mid&s;ummer</HI> and
<HI>September</HI> are mo&s;t e&s;teemed, when &s;everal en|ter
the Li&s;ts a hor&s;eback, whereas at this of
<HI>St I&s;idore</HI> all do it afoot. There are four pa&s;&s;ages
to the Piazza, which is &s;trewed with Sand, and
freed from tho&s;e moving Shops or Booths that
at other times pe&s;ter it; &s;ome ride, others walk
about it till the King appears, then his Guards
<PB N="79" REF="44">
break through the croud, and place them&s;elves
on each &s;ide to attend him: as &s;oon as their
Maje&s;ties are &s;eated in their Balconies, all go
out of the Piazza, which being cleared, fully
di&s;covers its beauty. At the &s;ame time four or
five <HI>Alguazils</HI> well mounted, and better then
becomes ordinary catchpoles, attend bare|headed,
and as &s;oon as the King gives the word,
he of them that hath authority over the Wag|gons,
cau&s;es them to move from the place they
&s;tand ranged in, and the barrels and &s;heep|skins
that are in them, di&s;til water &s;o artificially,
that the whole Piazza is equally bedewed: af|ter
which, they immediately depart by the four
Gates, which are &s;hut as &s;oon as they which are
to fight the Bulls are entered; among&s;t the&s;e gal|lant
champions was a fellow of <HI>Valladolid,</HI> mount|ed
on a Bull, he had mannaged and accu&s;tomed
to bridle and &s;addle; one a foot carrying his
Lance by him: he rid &s;treight up to the King,
and after a profound obei&s;ance, endeavoured to
&s;hew his own and his Bulls addre&s;s; he cau&s;ed
him to trot, gallop, and turn every way, but
that undi&s;ciplinable creature, weary at la&s;t of
the tediou&s;ne&s;s of the mannage, fell a kicking
and bounding &s;o fiercely, he threw the poor
Pea&s;ant, who not at all daunted at his misfor|tune,
ran after his Bull that made away, at|tended
by the hooting of all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance till
he had retaken him; but the&s;e quickly began
again, for as &s;oon as an <HI>Alguazil</HI> had recei|ved
the keys of the place where the Bulls were
inclo&s;ed, which <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> threw to
<PB N="80" REF="45">
him in ob&s;ervence of the cu&s;tom, which re|quires
the Kings giving them to his favorite, and
his ca&s;ting them from the Balcony to the <HI>Al|guazils;</HI>
and that tho&s;e wild bea&s;ts were let
loo&s;e, and furiou&s;ly attacqued one another; his,
though &s;o well mannaged and harna&s;&s;ed, &s;et on
a running without regard either to &s;pur or bri|dle,
making it impo&s;&s;ible for his Ma&s;ter to en|gage,
who &s;tood prepared to that purpo&s;e with
his Lance in Re&s;t; &s;o without any other effect
then the laughter of the a&s;&s;i&s;tants, after &s;e|veral
attempts, he retreated without &s;triking
&s;troke, though his Bull and he had received
many from tho&s;e that avoided not the &s;hock,
but ran to it. At the beginning of this &s;port
they u&s;ually let one Bull loo&s;e after another, who
according to his greater or le&s;&s;er fury with pre|cipitation
attaques &s;uch as are within the Li&s;ts,
whom he &s;oon drives away; but &s;uch as are &s;low|er
then the re&s;t, when they can no longer avoid
him, fall flat at their lengths, or pre&s;ent him their
Hats or Cloaks; he pa&s;&s;es by tho&s;e that lie on
the ground without hurting them, becau&s;e when
he gores he &s;huts his eyes, and commonly
&s;trikes nothing but the Air; they which pre|&s;ent
their Cloaks or Hats, by them, put a &s;top
to his rage, which lighting on any thing, is &s;a|tisfied.
What I have hitherto mentioned, is but
the farce; the &s;erious part, and that in which
the activity con&s;i&s;ts, is the darting certain Ar|rows
or little Javelins, which the skilful fix be|tween
the Bulls horns, with admirable dexte|rity,
without which they would be torn in
<PB N="81" REF="45">
pieces. A Barber &s;ignalized him&s;elf, the Bull feel|ing
the &s;mart of the&s;e little Javelins, (which for
their better &s;upport through the Air are wing|ed
with red Paper) grows to a higher rage,
whil&s;t by his &s;trugling and tormenting him&s;elf, the
iron heads piercei farther. It is &s;aid, that be|tween
the horns of the&s;e creatures is a little
place, &s;o very tender and delicate that the &s;mal|le&s;t
wound there is mortal; at which &s;ome of
the Champions can aim &s;o well, that they kill
a Bull at the fir&s;t &s;troke; when he &s;eems almo&s;t
tired and &s;pent, the Trumpets &s;ound, the &s;ignal
to ham&s;tring him: then with Swords and Hang|ers
they endeavor to cut the &s;inews of his hin|der
legs, after which, thru&s;ts and &s;la&s;hes which
they call Cuchilladas &s;howre on the poor bea&s;t.
In this the common people make their bloody in|clination
apparent, for &s;uch as can come at him,
would &s;carcely think them&s;elves &s;ons of hone&s;t
Mothers, did they not plunge their Daggers in
his body, after which, <HI>qua&s;i re bene ge&s;ta,</HI> they
march off triumphantly: When he moves no
more, Mules come a gallop to draw him out
of the Li&s;ts, and another is let loo&s;e. About
a &s;core were killed that day, the skins &s;o
pinked, they could be of no u&s;e but to make
Sives; Dogs are &s;ometimes &s;et again&s;t them when
it is too trouble&s;ome and dangerous for men
to joyn them, and the plea&s;ure would &s;ure be
greater, if when the dogs have fa&s;tened on them,
they forbore wounding them on all &s;ides: the
only hor&s;eman that appeared this day, was the
Buffoon of Don <HI>Lewis de Haro,</HI> the &s;ame that
<PB N="82" REF="46">
&s;hewed him&s;elf at <HI>Aranjuez;</HI> he made one car|rier
with his Lance hand&s;ome enough, but the
King unwilling he &s;hould get mi&s;chief, cau&s;ed
him to retire. This manner of fight is to be
performed with &s;hort &s;tirrups, otherwi&s;e a leg
may be ea&s;ily &s;poiled; not with mannaged hor|&s;es,
but &s;uch only as are fleet, and have tender
mouths: when the Bulls are to be attacqued
on hor&s;eback, &s;uch as have hor&s;es proper for
it, cannot hand&s;omly refu&s;e to lend them, nor
with honour pretend to any &s;atisfaction, if (as
it often happens) they be &s;poiled in the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>This days &s;port properly belonging to Pea|&s;ants,
one &s;uch, in affront to Cavaliers, came in
mounted on an A&s;s, which the Bull at fir&s;t over|threw,
but the fellow having recovered his cou|rage,
and &s;illy animal, attacqued the Bull with &s;o
good &s;ucce&s;s, that he gave him a great wound
between the horns, which bled extremely: af|ter
&s;o gallant an exploit, he begged the Bull of
the King, which being given him he went
away with his famous prize, better &s;atisfied then
if crowned with Laurel. The Bull oftentimes falls
upon the Guards, who &s;tand ranked on one
&s;ide of the Piazza with Darts and Halbards;
if they kill him he is theirs; he twice charged
them through, and overthrew &s;ome of them,
nothing of gallantry appearing on their &s;ide, who
&s;uffered the Bull to trample on their bellies, in|&s;tead
of killing him at their feet. The Algu|azils
or Serjeants are very con&s;picuous, with fair
embroidered Saddles, and their hor&s;es adorned
with Ribands, and ta&s;&s;els; they were very nim|ble
<PB N="83" REF="46">
in quitting all places the Bulls approached,
and it had been the be&s;t of the &s;port to have
&s;een them charged home, at lea&s;t this was
mo&s;t wi&s;hed, but by the readine&s;s of their
flight, they e&s;caped the&s;e horns, though probably
not tho&s;e which are &s;o common in <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P>The grand &s;olemnity begins not till the af|ternoon,
but five or &s;ix Bulls are attacqued in
the morning, for the &s;akes of &s;uch as cannot
be pre&s;ent afterwards: at this, order is not &s;o
well ob&s;erved, which &s;ometimes occa&s;ions mi&s;|chief.
I was told that this day in the morning
&s;everal were hurt, and one kill'd by a horn that
entred by his eye. They end not but with day-light,
and every Gallant gives his Mi&s;tri&s;s a Bal|cone
and Collation. In all the circum&s;tances of
this diver&s;ion, a certain inveterate cruelty derived
from <HI>Africk,</HI> and hat for&s;ook not this Coun|trey
with the Moor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> is very remarkable: for
the plea&s;ure of ordinary Spaniards is not fight|ing
the Bulls, the rabble delighting in nothing
&s;o much as &s;hedding his blood. At <HI>Tunis</HI> and
<HI>Algier</HI> are the like &s;olemnities, but (as they
&s;ay) with greater &s;plendor.</P>
<P>As the publick &s;ports, the Moors introduced
in <HI>Spain;</HI> whil&s;t they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, continue after
their exile; the Church al&s;o retains &s;omething
of their &s;uper&s;tition, e&s;pecially on <HI>Corpus Chri|&s;ti</HI>
day. The Twenty &s;eventh of <HI>May</HI> we &s;aw all
its Ceremonies, which are many, and la&s;t long;
they begin by a proce&s;&s;ion, who&s;e fir&s;t ranks
are intermixed with &s;everal Hoboies, Tabors,
and Ca&s;tanettas, a great many habited in par|ty
<PB N="84" REF="47">
coloured clothes, skip and dance as extrava|lantly
as at a Morrice. The King goes
to <HI>St Maries</HI> Church not far from his Palace,
and after Ma&s;s, returns with a Torch in his
hand, following a &s;ilver Tabernacle, in which
is the Holy Wafer, attended by the Grandes of
<HI>Spain,</HI> and his &s;everal Councils. This day to a|void
di&s;pute, they ob&s;erve not order, &s;o that the
Coun&s;ellors <HI>de la Hazienda,</HI> joyn with tho&s;e
of the <HI>Indies;</HI> before the&s;e Coun&s;ellors and cer|tain
other per&s;ons, move Machines, repre&s;ent|ing
Giants; the&s;e are Statues of Pasbord car|ried
by men concealed under them: they are
of &s;everal &s;hapes, &s;ome very hideous; all of
them repre&s;ent Femals, except ths fir&s;t, which
is only the Figure of a great head painted, with|in
which is concealed a little man that gives
it meen and motion: it being a <HI>Colo&s;&s;us</HI> over
the body of a Pigmie. Among&s;t the&s;e chimeri|cal
Mon&s;ters, there is one which repre&s;ents two
Giante&s;&s;es, Moors, or Aethiopians, &s;uch having
really been if we may beleeve the vulgar, who
call them <HI>Hios de Vicinos,</HI> that is, neighbors chil|dren.
The people are &s;o taken with the&s;e
Gothick figures, that there is &s;carce any Vil|lage
without them. They report the Giante&s;&s;es
to have lived in the time of King <HI>Mammelin,</HI>
and on that account &s;ometimes call them
<HI>Mammelins,</HI> after the name of that Gothick
or Moori&s;h King, who once Reigned in <HI>Spain.</HI>
I was told of another terrible Pageant which
they call <HI>Tara&s;ca,</HI> from a wood that was for|merly
in <HI>Province,</HI> where at pre&s;ent &s;tands the
<PB N="85" REF="47">
City of <HI>Tara&s;con</HI> on the banks of <HI>Ro&s;ne,</HI> over
again&s;t <HI>Beaucaire.</HI> They fancy that in this
place was once a Serpent (no le&s;s enemy of
Mankind, then that which &s;educed our fir&s;t An|ce&s;tors
in Paradice) called <HI>Behemoth,</HI> and re|port
that <HI>St Martha</HI> by orai&s;ons triumphed
over it, leading it pri&s;oner in her apron &s;trings.
Be this Hi&s;tory or Fable, the <HI>Tara&s;ca</HI> is a Ser|pent
of enormous greatne&s;s, in form of a Wo|man,
moving on wheels, the body covered
with &s;cales, a va&s;t belly, long tail, &s;hort feet,
&s;harp talons, fiery eyes, gaping mouth, out of
which extend three tongues, and long tusks.
This Bulbegger &s;talks up and down and they
which are under the pa&s;tboard and paper, of
which it is compo&s;ed, by certain Springs, cau&s;e
it to move &s;o dexterou&s;ly, that it puts off the
Hat to the Sots that &s;tare at it, and &s;ometimes
lays hold on Countrey fellows, who&s;e fright
moves laughter among&s;t the people. Such as
plea&s;e them&s;elves in telling wonders of this fop|pery,
relate that a certain Town having &s;ent to
&s;ome of its neighbors &s;ix of the&s;e paper Giants,
two Pigmies, and the Tara&s;ca to be made u&s;e
of on <HI>Corpus Chri&s;ti</HI> day, they which give them
their motion being entred, to divert them&s;elves
in the pa&s;&s;age, cau&s;ed them to dance as at pro|ce&s;&s;ions
by couples: they were met by certain
Muliters or Carriers, who (Moon&s;hine di&s;co|vering
at a di&s;tance, the&s;e imaginary Mon&s;ters,)
marching with a great deal of prattle and
loud laughter, for their merrier pa&s;&s;ing two
<PB N="86" REF="48">
or three Leagues) not recollecting what was
to be done the day after, were &s;o affrighted,
that the terror &s;till augmenting, by their con|templating
tho&s;e fanta&s;mes, they at la&s;t run
away with all their might. The conducters of
the Mon&s;ters perceiving this, ca&s;ting off their
Vizards, went out of the Machines to di&s;abu&s;e
them, running after them to cau&s;e them to come
back to their Mules and charges; this increa&s;ed
their a&s;toni&s;hment, and ha&s;tened their pace,
which aided by the wings of fear, &s;oon tran&s;|ported
them cro&s;s the fields to a village, which
they allarmed to free the Countrey of high|way
men, &s;o hideous, they could be little le&s;s
then Devils: the other in the mean time &s;lip|ping
their ca&s;es, and perceiving them&s;elves ma|&s;ters
of the the &s;poils, the muletiers had aban|doned,
began to vi&s;it the baggage, and finding
Wine, drank &s;o much they fell fa&s;t a&s;leep till
morning. The Muletiers after their rai&s;ing the
Village, and bringing the Ju&s;tice to the place,
perceived their mi&s;take, and the Countrey fel|lows
laughing heartily at them, drank the re|mainder
of the Wine in recompence of their
trouble. The Village of the &s;olemnity, a great
while waited for tho&s;e grim Puppets, which
came too late, and by their excu&s;e and relati|on
of what had happened, di&s;ordered the whole
proce&s;&s;ion, changing it into a Ring of &s;uch as
abandoned the Cro&s;s and Banner, to heark|en
to their &s;tory. The plea&s;ante&s;t po&s;ture of the&s;e
Mammelinas that I &s;aw was, when they made
their &s;alutes before the Queens Balcony, be|&s;ides

great, one cannot pa&s;s without difficulty, and
we had much ado to return to <HI>St Maries</HI>
Church where the proce&s;&s;ion ended. As &s;oon
as free from it we went to the Palace, and
there &s;aw the King, Queen, and Infanta, return
with all the Court Ladies: I think I have men|tioned
all that is worth notice, unle&s;s it be that
as on this day all the men put on Summer
cloaths, &s;o do all the Ladies, and tho&s;e new and
very rich, of &s;everal fa&s;hions and colours. In

<P>The two companies of Players that belong

this they do every evening in publick on Scaf|folds
erected to that purpo&s;e in the &s;treets be|fore
the hou&s;es of the Pre&s;idents of &s;everal
Councils. They begin at Court the day of the
Solemnity, where a &s;eat under a State is pro|vided
for their Maje&s;ties: the Stage is at the
foot of the&s;e Scaffolds, and little painted Booths

rowled to it, environ it, and &s;erve as tiring
hou&s;es. This is continued certain days, every

erected before his hou&s;e: before the&s;e <HI>Autos</HI>
begin, all the foppery of the Proce&s;&s;ion dances,
and the Gigantine Machines make the people
&s;port; but what I mo&s;t admired in that which I
&s;aw at a di&s;tance in the old <HI>Prado,</HI> is, that in the
&s;treets and open air they u&s;e Torches to tho&s;e
pieces, which in the daily Theaters, and with|in
doors, they repre&s;ent without other light
then that of the Sun: all the&s;e antick ceremo|nies
appeared much more ridiculous to tho&s;e
that beheld them, then they can po&s;&s;ibly do in
my de&s;cribing them, and confirm me in what
I often ob&s;erved, that the Spaniards, and other
wi&s;e and grave nations &s;eem fonde&s;t in their di|ver&s;ions,

<P>The next day the Alguazils came to the
hou&s;e where we lodged to demand account of
our ho&s;te of his provi&s;ion of victuals and what
Poultry he fatted. They were very inqui&s;itive,
what he did with &s;uch abundance, and where
and why he had bought it; he told them we
gave him Money to be our Caterer, but this
would not &s;erve his turn, becau&s;e &s;o great &s;tore
is forbidden by Law, and gives a jealou&s;ie that
the Ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e keeps an Ordinary or
Pen&s;ion, which is not allowed: be&s;ides all which
certain witne&s;&s;es depo&s;ed that he &s;ent victuals
abroad to &s;ome of the company that lay &s;ick,
and that he bought &s;ome at the private Kit|chins
<PB N="89" REF="49">
of Don <HI>Lewis</HI> de <HI>Haro</HI> and others, all ve|ry
&s;treightly prohibited. The rea&s;on why nei|ther
Ordinaries nor Pen&s;ions are allowed in <HI>Ma|drid,</HI>
nor any part of <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;eems very &s;trange,
when they tell you that con&s;ideration of the &s;te|rility
of the Countrey, gives apprehen&s;ion of
Famine, and an entire disfurni&s;hing the Markets
by tho&s;e that keep &s;uch hou&s;es; for it appears
to me, that liberty being left to every one to
buy what he plea&s;es, and as much as he plea&s;es,
provided it be by his Dome&s;tick, the &s;ame in|convenience
will no le&s;s follow.</P>
<P>However, it is good to keep out of the
Laws clutches in <HI>Spain;</HI> e&s;pecially, in occa&s;ions
where the Catchpoles interpo&s;e; for, for a matter
of nothing, they &s;eize and carry away all, and
the Ma&s;ter to pri&s;on, from whence he e&s;capes
not without the aid of Money, be his cau&s;e right
or wrong; e&s;pecially, if he be thought rich:
fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es are never wanting, and here
the neighbors had depo&s;ed again&s;t our ho&s;te out
of envy; but his good luck was to be Tenant
to an Alguazil; this Serjeant mediating with
his Comrades, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by four pi&s;tols, the In|formation
was cancelled, and our Ho&s;t not car|ried
to pri&s;on as they had intended: by this,
all here appears vendible, though had this cheat
of the Alguazils been complained of they had
run hazard of being &s;ent to the Gallies. This
was almo&s;t the only puni&s;hment inflicted in tho&s;e
times by rea&s;on of want of men to be em|ployed

An A&s;&s;enti&s;ta, that is a Patentee or Farmer
of Levies of &s;oldiers, or of the Kings Revenue,
was a little before a&s;&s;aulted in his chamber by
Theeves, one of which being taken, di&s;cover|ed
his confederates; among&s;t whom, (though
they &s;et daggers at his throat, and wounded him
in the head) was a Frier; the fir&s;t with his
Comrade was whipped and &s;ent to the Gallies,
and the Frier condemned to pa&s;s the remainder of
his days between four walls with bread and wa|ter.
This man being a &s;tranger, little befriend|ed,
and ignorant of the cu&s;tomes of the Coun|try,
had much ado to obtain this Ju&s;tice. He
was born at St. <HI>Omer,</HI> but re&s;ides ordinarily at
<HI>London,</HI> from whence he &s;ends Iri&s;hmen to &s;erve
in <HI>Catalonia.</HI> Such French as they take at Sea are
in like manner &s;ent to the Gallies, from which
none can be freed, without putting one in his
place, which co&s;ts dear, there being no other
way but to find out &s;ome <HI>Negro</HI> Slave.</P>
<P>The Commerce of the Indies hath re&s;tored
rights of &s;ervitude in the&s;e Countries, and in
<HI>Andalu&s;ia</HI> there are few other Servants. The
greate&s;t part of the&s;e are either Moors or perfect
Blacks, which gives occa&s;ion to the Proverb, <HI>No a&s;|&s;i
tratan los hombres Blancos:</HI> White Men are not
be &s;o u&s;ed. Chri&s;tianity requires, that &s;uch as
embrace it be enfranchi&s;ed, but this is not ob|&s;erved
in <HI>Spain,</HI> and tho&s;e wretches are not
made freemen by becomming Chri&s;tians. They
are much more cruelly u&s;ed in the <HI>Indies,</HI> where
inhumanity hath &s;o long prevailed, that all ima|ginable
rigor is exerci&s;ed on tho&s;e unhappy crea|tures,
<PB N="91" REF="50">
who are only &s;uch by occa&s;ion of their
Mines of Gold and Silver, to which their Ma|&s;ters
owe all their fortune and greatne&s;s. An in|credible
number of them found their graves,
while&s;t they digged for tho&s;e Metals, &s;o that
&s;carce any remain to pur&s;ue that fatal imploy|ment.
Be&s;ides this de&s;truction made by the
Mines, it is &s;aid the Wine &s;ent thither, occa&s;i|ons
&s;o many di&s;ea&s;es, that the greate&s;t part of
the Indians die. They are pa&s;&s;ionate Lovers of
this liquor, and &s;pare nothing that may obtain
it; and the Spaniards to di&s;cover the Trea&s;ures
they may have concealed, &s;ell it them, to the
ruin of their goods, health, and &s;trength for la|bour;
and I remember to have read a Book in|tituled
<HI>Las Excellentias del E&s;pannol,</HI> in four or
five Chapters where the Author makes appear
the prejudice the King and Traffick of the <HI>In|dies,</HI>
receive by the Vines planted in <HI>Peru;</HI> and
often repeats, that the vice of the We&s;t-Indians
being Drunkenne&s;s, many of them peri&s;h by
Wine, not like their <HI>Chica,</HI> made of Maiz and
more agreeable to their Con&s;titutions; be&s;ides
that, the Spaniards to get more, and by &s;elling it
cheap, to make quicker returns, fal&s;ifie it, in &s;uch
a manner, it is little better than poi&s;on. On
the&s;e occa&s;ions the Indians are &s;o much wa&s;ted,
that for &s;ome years there have not been enough
to work in the Vine-yards nor Mines of <HI>Peru.</HI>
Negro's are therefore made u&s;e of, bought in
<HI>Guine,</HI> or the Kingdom of <HI>Angola;</HI> by which
means the profit is much le&s;&s;ened, a Negro co&s;t|ing
50 or 60 Crowns, and &s;ince <HI>Portugal</HI> hath
<PB N="92" REF="51">
re-e&s;tabli&s;hed their true King, and that all tho&s;e
Countries of the <HI>Indies</HI> that are &s;tronge&s;t in Co|lonies,
have acknowledged him, Negro's are
not had &s;o cheap; for be&s;ides the 60 Pieces of
Eight they co&s;t, the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> hath laid
an Impo&s;t equal to the Price, &s;o that a Negro
comes not to <HI>Carthagena,</HI> where they land, till
he &s;tands the Spaniards in above 200 Crowns.
The profit the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> makes by this, is
incredible, tho&s;e that under&s;tand Trade, a&s;&s;u|ring
it amounts yearly to &s;ome Millions of Gold.
The con&s;ideration of this and &s;ome other things
before mentioned, make evident to me what I
was often told at <HI>Madrid,</HI> that the great wealth
of the <HI>Indies</HI> belongs more to particular per&s;ons
and &s;trangers, than to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and
that at this time when the Gallions are expected
richer than in many late years, becau&s;e of the
return of the Viceroy, it is thought 3 quarters
of what it brings is on account of Merchant Stran|gers,
and that there will not come to the King
and natural Spaniards above Three Millions of
Gold.</P>
<P>They which manage the Affairs of that Coun|trey,
very pro&s;perou&s;ly advance their own, and
the Earl of <HI>Pigneranda</HI> Pre&s;ident of its Council,
draws va&s;t &s;ums for Licences to French Mer|chants;
One I knew, that for leave to bring a
hundred Hides from St. <HI>Domingo</HI> by the Gallions,
gave Ten Pi&s;tols. Notwith&s;tanding all which,
much deceit is u&s;ed in that particular, and the
greate&s;t part of the French that trade into <HI>Spain,</HI>
import and export at their plea&s;ure all manner of
<PB N="93" REF="51">
Commodities, by pretending to be Walloons,
Burgundians, Lorrainers, or Flemings. For
this rea&s;on the King was coun&s;elled to give free|dom
to trade, and to aboli&s;h the Fees of Licen|ces,
and Impo&s;t of the Tenth Peny on all French
Merchandi&s;e; repre&s;enting that his profit would
be greater, becau&s;e the u&s;ual duties would be
paid without any fraud; whereas to avoid this
Tenth, the Merchants combine, and they that
have French Goods, get one or other to atte&s;t
they are Engli&s;h or Flemmi&s;h, and &s;o (at mo&s;t)
pay but the ordinary Cu&s;tom, of which al&s;o
they are &s;ometimes crafty enough to deceive
him.</P>
<P>The Commerce of the&s;e is principally in <HI>An|dalu&s;ia,</HI>
where they have found a place of free|dom
as convenient as <HI>Cadis;</HI> this is the haven of
<HI>Santa Maria,</HI> a little Town belonging to the
Duke af <HI>Medina Coeli,</HI> who protects them, and
draws great Trade to the prejudice of <HI>Cadis</HI> and
<HI>Sevil.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>France</HI> were at peace, Traf|fick
was more difficult then at pre&s;ent, little Mer|chandi&s;e
arriving that was not confi&s;cated under
pretence of coming from <HI>Holland.</HI> There never
wanted two or three Knights of the Po&s;t to
&s;wear this, but time and care have given remedy
to this mi&s;chief, and fal&s;e &s;wearers e&s;cape not,
Merchants by pre&s;enting a Bever, or &s;ome other
Knack, putting them&s;elves under the protection
of &s;ome Grande.</P>
<P>By this is evident that <HI>Spain</HI> cannot well be
without Commerce with <HI>France,</HI> not only on the
<PB N="94" REF="52">
Frontiers of <HI>Bi&s;cai</HI> and <HI>Arragon,</HI> where it hath
been almo&s;t ever permitted, but through the
whole Countrey where it is prohibited, for <HI>Pro|vence</HI>
hath ever had corre&s;pondencies in the
Kingdom of <HI>Valentia,</HI> by its nece&s;&s;ity of the o|thers
Commodities; and for the &s;ame rea&s;on
<HI>Britaign, Normandy,</HI> and other parts on the O|cean
have continually &s;ent theirs to <HI>Cadis</HI> and
<HI>Bilbo.</HI> I &s;peak not of Corn and Stuffs of all &s;orts
brought from that Country, but even of Iron|work
and Sword; by which it appears a mi&s;take
to think that in the&s;e dayes the be&s;t come out of
<HI>Spain.</HI> No more being now made at <HI>Toledo,</HI>
few but forrain are u&s;ed, unle&s;s a very &s;mall
quantity that come from <HI>Bi&s;cai,</HI> which are ex|ce&s;&s;ivly
dear.</P>
<P>It is moreover hard to imagine how much
<HI>Spain</HI> &s;uffers for want of manufactures: So few
Artificers remain in its Towns, that native Com|modities
are carried abroad to be wrought in
forrain Countries. Wools and Silks are tran&s;|ported
raw, and being &s;pun and weaved in <HI>Eng|land,
France,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> return thither at dear
rates. The Land it &s;elf is not tilled by the peo|ple
it feeds. In Seed-time, Harve&s;t, and Vintage,
Husbandmen come from <HI>Bearn</HI> and other parts
of <HI>France,</HI> who get a great deal of money by &s;ow|ing
and reaping their Corn, and dre&s;&s;ing and
cutting their Vines. Carpenters and Ma&s;ons
are (for the mo&s;t part) al&s;o &s;trangers, who will
be paid treble what they can get in their own
Countrey. In <HI>Madrid</HI> there is hardly a Water-bearer
that is not a Foreigner, &s;uch are al&s;o the
<PB N="95" REF="52">
greate&s;t part of Shoomakers and Taylors, and it
is believed the third of the&s;e come only to get a
little money and afterwards return home, but
none thrive &s;o much as Architects, Ma&s;ons, and
Carpenters. Almo&s;t every hou&s;e hath wooden
windows (here being no gla&s;s) and a balcony
jutting into the Street. Once in five years all
Fabricks are re-builded, of which the Fronti&s;|piece
only is done with Lime, the &s;ides and back-parts,
being u&s;ually earth.</P>
<P>Every hou&s;e in <HI>Madrid</HI> pays duties to the
King which mount high, the fir&s;t floor of eve|ry
one is his, which if not redeemed, he may
&s;ell at his plea&s;ure; This the Proprietors u&s;ually
buy, to do which if they be not able they build
no more but it alone. This is the rea&s;on there
are &s;o many little hou&s;es in <HI>Madrid,</HI> with only
one &s;tair to get up to the Garret. The mo&s;t con|&s;iderable
Architecture is that which is adorned
with &s;ome Tower, only one of the&s;e is allowed,
and he that will build more, mu&s;t have permi&s;|&s;ion
to do it: A fellow that thought he &s;hould
have much ado to obtain this, begged leave but
for one, which being ea&s;ily granted, he built
one on account of the permi&s;&s;ion, and another
becau&s;e one had never been prohibited. No|thing
is more notorious, then that <HI>Madrid</HI>
wanting both &s;ome Rivolet to void its filth and
Vault to receive it, ca&s;ts all into the Street; but
it is admirable to &s;ee that by vivacity and pene|tration
of the Air, all is con&s;umed in a moment,
it being as drying and corro&s;ive (if one may &s;o
call it) as lime that devours a body before the
<PB N="96" REF="53">
corruption di&s;covers it &s;elf, and I have found
dead Dogs and Cats in the Streets that &s;melt
not, by which we may perceive they had rea&s;on
that cho&s;e this place for the Seat of their Kings,
the Air being not only hard to corrupt, but
takes away even the cau&s;e of corruption, by di&s;|&s;olution
of Elementary qualities as &s;udden as
imperceptible. In antient times their Queens
repaired hither to lie in, that the Princes might
at their births breath an Air who&s;e purity is not
to be equalized. The Waters of this place have
been weighed again&s;t &s;everal other, and none
have been found &s;o light. The Cardinal Infant
had them carried with him into <HI>Flanders,</HI> and
great care was taken to &s;hip for him Tuns of the
&s;ame the King drinks, the Fountain of which is a
little without the Town. The Streets here being
Common Shores, one ran great hazard, were it
allowed at all hours to ca&s;t out at window what
the people will no longer keep in their hou&s;es;
but from day break til ten at Night this is forbid|den
under a pecuniary mulct. Once I remember
I &s;aw a Woman that had forgot this, whom the
Serjeants, that wait on &s;uch little advantages,
immediately cau&s;ed to pay the Fine, which is
Sixty Rials, about <HI>25 s.</HI> of our Money. They
which walk a Nights, carry neither Torch nor
Lantern, which I never &s;aw born before any,
whether in Coach, a horsback, or a foot; La|dies
of quality only make u&s;e of the&s;e, &s;uch as
belong to the Court e&s;pecially, who then mu|&s;ter
all their Footmen. Women here go abroad
with much more &s;plendor than their Husbands,
<PB N="97" REF="53">
for be&s;ides a great number of &s;ervants about
their Sedans, a Steward or Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e
&s;till follows them on hor&s;eback: in great hou&s;es,
Footmen neither enter their Lords chamber,
nor yet his apartment, they being &s;erved by
their Gentlemen, Pages, and other Officers;
when called, they kneel, receiving their
Commands; this cu&s;tom hath gone higher in
the Favourites family, for I have been a&s;&s;ured,
that when Don <HI>Lewis</HI> gives Audience, and his
Secretary &s;erves as Interpreter, he kneels; and
what is &s;tranger, that <HI>Fernando de Contreras</HI>
(none of his Dome&s;tick, but the Kings &s;ervant,
and the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of his Secretaries of
State, as having charge of the <HI>De&s;pecho</HI> Univer|&s;al)
pays him that honour. For what concerns
the re&s;pect due to the King and all &s;uch as are
near him; they have many little cu&s;toms very
extraordinary; among&s;t others, that no man ever
mounts a hor&s;e the King hath once made u&s;e
of: and they &s;ay, that after the taking of <HI>Bar|cellona,</HI>
in the Cavalcade his Maje&s;ty made to
<HI>Atocha;</HI> the Duke of <HI>Medina de los torres,</HI> &s;ent
to pre&s;ent him his mo&s;t beautiful hor&s;e that
was &s;o famous in <HI>Madrid;</HI> but the King re|turned
him &s;aying, <HI>Scrina la&s;tima,</HI> that is, it
were pity, &s;ince by that means he would be|come
u&s;ele&s;s, and rid only by Querries: and in|deed
no hor&s;es are &s;o little rid as the Kings,

got out of any thing it lights on.</P>
<P>They are cheaper in <HI>June,</HI> people going afoot

<P>We were told of another cu&s;tom, no le&s;s
extraordinary, that no natural Son of the
King, owned to be &s;uch, may enter <HI>Madrid;</HI>
and that Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> who at pre|&s;ent,
Commands in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> was never there,
he was bred at <HI>Ocanna,</HI> &s;ome Leagues from the
Court where the King &s;ometimes vi&s;ited him,
and not long &s;ince he was within a League of
this Town where he al&s;o met him. It is belie|ved
this King hath more &s;uch i&s;&s;ue, but being
by Ladys of quality, he owns them not; he &s;el|dom
attempted any without &s;ucce&s;s; yet a cer|tain
Lady of <HI>Madrid,</HI> is reported to have been
inexorable to him, though &s;he was not &s;o to
all the world; &s;he &s;till excu&s;ed her &s;elf with pro|te&s;tations
of as much e&s;teem as re&s;pect for his
per&s;on, but that &s;he could not without hor|ror
apprehend to become a whore of Hi|&s;tory.</P>
<P>I enquired the rea&s;on why the Kings natu|ral
i&s;&s;ue may not come to <HI>Madrid,</HI> but found

of <HI>Spain,</HI> is of no validity, &s;ince I have &s;een
a Letter of <HI>Don Lewis de Haro</HI> to <HI>Don John</HI> of

but mo&s;t Serene Highne&s;s; but what&s;o|ever
the cau&s;e may be that the Gates of the

jealou&s;ie real or imaginary, might be occa&s;i|oned
by their pre&s;ence there; it is mo&s;t certain
that this nation hath a great deal, for what&s;o|ever
in the lea&s;t concerns it in love or Honour,
of which, many little &s;tories of daily pa&s;&s;ages
in <HI>Madrid</HI> are related, where the extravagance
of Women produces various pa&s;&s;ions in the com|merce
of criminal Gallantry, which hath its
punctilios of honor as well as a knot of high|way
men, its ju&s;tice within it &s;elf; They which

The Earl of <HI>Fie&s;chi,</HI> who at his fir&s;t

Sex, tells as a Gallantry, his u&s;age by one of
tho&s;e Cattle, who openly at the <HI>Tour</HI> fell upon
him with reproaches of infidelity, calling him
<HI>Traidor</HI> and <HI>Picaro,</HI> becau&s;e &s;he had heard he
had a new Mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>And Mr. <HI>de Mogeron</HI> was not a little &s;urprized, by
a Womans treating him in the &s;ame manner one
Evening, pulling him by the hair with reproaches
and injuries; becau&s;e he had not vi&s;ited her ac|cording
to a promi&s;e made her at the <HI>Tour,</HI> where
he met her the day before. They do a thou&s;and
&s;uch extravagances, and are really Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of
the Epithite <HI>Bizarre,</HI> which in their Language
is under&s;tood in &s;o good a &s;en&s;e. They are ridi|culous

under others very homely, &s;o that
you would not take any of them to be braver
than the re&s;t, unle&s;s you &s;ee them at &s;ome Fe&s;tival,

Be&s;ides the great numbers of loo&s;e Women
that are to be found up and down <HI>Madrid,</HI> there
are others in certain fixed quarters, countenan|ced
by Publick Authority, for accommodation
of any that will go to them. The&s;e are called
<HI>Cantonera's,</HI> perhaps <HI>Bulkers.</HI> They have a Sa|lary
from the Town, for which cau&s;e &s;o infamous
an imployment is &s;ought after, and when one of
the Jades dies or is di&s;abled by the Pox, the Ma|gi&s;trates
are &s;ollicited for the vacancy. What
their Pen&s;ion is I could not learn, but tho&s;e
which a&s;&s;ured me of this bea&s;tly e&s;tabli&s;hment,
told me that every one that vi&s;its them is obliged
to pay them 12 <HI>Quarto</HI>'s, about 6 Pence of our
Money. Phy&s;itians are fee'd by the publick, to
take care they be free from tho&s;e Pe&s;tilential Di&s;|ea&s;es
that are gained by &s;o honourable a Profe&s;&s;i|on.
A Matron al&s;o belongs to them, who is
obliged to adverti&s;e the Magi&s;trate or Phy&s;itian,
as &s;oon as &s;he di&s;covers any thing ami&s;s. They
which de&s;cribed to me the lives of the&s;e mi&s;erable
creatures, told me that when they are accompa|nied,
a &s;econd man is never admitted, on which
account there never happens any di&s;order; the
fir&s;t enterer leaving his Sword and Dagger at the
Door, which when they which come after per|ceive,
they retire without more ado. Sinning
thus with impunity and toleration of Publick Au|thority&punc;
they &s;eldom for&s;ake the vice they &s;o
openly profe&s;&s;e, though one day in the year is
devoted to exhort them to repentance: On a
Friday in <HI>Lent,</HI> they are by an <HI>Alguazil</HI> or
two conducted to the Church of Penitents, and
<PB N="102" REF="56">
there &s;eated near the Pulpit, where the Preacher
does his be&s;t to touch their hearts, but &s;eldom
with &s;ucce&s;s; after many vain exhortations to
amend their lives, de&s;cending from his Pulpit, he
pre&s;ents them the Crucifix, &s;aying, <HI>Behold the
Lord, embrace him;</HI> which if any does, &s;he is
immediately taken away, and &s;hut up in the
Cloi&s;ter of Penitents; but u&s;ually they only hang
down their heads and &s;hed a few tears, without
laying hold on what is offered, and after their
grimaces continue their debo&s;hed life; neither
can the Story of St. <HI>Mary Magdalene</HI> &s;o often
inculcated to them, move them to imitation
of her.</P>
<P>In this antick of remarques which I have dau|bed
with &s;o many colours, I mu&s;t not forget what
concerns the impri&s;onment of the Duke of <HI>Lor|rain.</HI>
He failed but very little of an e&s;cape,
and that news had not come of his being enter|ed
the Frontiers of <HI>Portugal</HI> when he was thought
&s;till in the heart of <HI>Ca&s;tille.</HI> As &s;oon as he arri|ved
in <HI>Spain</HI> he was confined to <HI>Toledo,</HI> without
being admitted to the Kings pre&s;ence. When
misfortunes of War of State ca&s;t one Soveraign
into the hands of another, methinks he ought
not to be treated altogether as a Pri&s;oner, but
that his Captivity &s;hould be made u&s;e of, to
work upon him and gain his affection by Offices
of honour and civility. Of the two French Kings
that were taken Pri&s;oners, it is notoriou&s;ly
known that <HI>Francis</HI> the Fir&s;t left <HI>Spain</HI> intirely
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by thoughts of hatred and re|venge
on account of his ill u&s;age by <HI>Charles</HI> the
<PB N="103" REF="56">
Fifth: and that <HI>John</HI> returned from <HI>England</HI> &s;o
well &s;atisfied, that he was ever afterward careful
to live with <HI>Edward</HI> as with a Friend and Bro|ther:
but the Spani&s;h au&s;terity &s;uffers not a Max|ime
that may be deceitful, and gra&s;pes hard what|ever
it laies hold on to prevent e&s;cape: She would
never let Duke <HI>Charles</HI> ta&s;te the air of her Court,
and notwith&s;tanding his many in&s;tances, ever
treated him as a &s;imple pri&s;oner of State, though
&s;he &s;uffered him to go abroad under good Guard
both to Church and to take the Air, which in|cited
him to attempt greater liberty. Thus he
laid his de&s;ign, One of the Kings Coaches was
appointed to attend him, who&s;e Coachman hap|pened
to be a Lorrainer, and con&s;equently his
&s;ubject. He &s;uppo&s;ed this mans affection to his
natural Prince, would oblige him to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting
towards his liberty, and re&s;olved to have him
&s;ounded. I could not learn whom he made u&s;e
of to engage him, nor in what manner he &s;et it
a foot, but it is &s;aid, that having gained him, he
&s;everal times left Tickets under the Cu&s;hions of
the Coach, and the place he &s;ate on, which the
Coachman very carefully took away; and by
means of a Lorrain Embroderer, &s;ent to
tho&s;e that had the principal management of the
Affair. This went &s;o far before its di&s;covery,
that the Coachman had received in&s;tructions to
drive the Duke very often beyond a ruinated
Building that was near the part he u&s;ually fre|quented,
and one day, when lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected, 50
Hor&s;men were appointed to lie concealed behind
it, who having killed his Guards and &s;et him at
<PB N="104" REF="57">
liberty, were to convoy him to the Frontiers of
<HI>Portugal,</HI> where 500 Hor&s;e &s;hould be ready to
receive him. A Ticket, and perhaps the la&s;t
that was nece&s;&s;ary to this Negotiation, di&s;covered
it; for whether it were that it was not hand&s;om|ly
enough conveyed under the Cu&s;hion, or
whether the Captain that then commanded the
Guard, and was in the Coach with him, ob|&s;erved
better what was done than others, or that
he was more jealous, going out of the Coach,
&s;earching the Cu&s;hion, he found the Ticket;
upon this the Duke was more &s;traitly &s;hut up, the
Coachman impri&s;oned, and the Ticket &s;ent to
<HI>Madrid,</HI> where the Dukes Secretary and the
Embroiderer were &s;ecured; the la&s;t of the&s;e was
racked, but the particulars of what he depo&s;ed
never publi&s;hed The light that appeared at the
bottom of this Affair, moved the Spaniards
them&s;elves to &s;ay, <HI>That to hold the Duke fa&s;ter
at the very time his liberty was mo&s;t earne&s;tly &s;olli|cited,
they per&s;waded him he would have made an
e&s;cape:</HI> whatever may be of it, it is certain the
Duke was not afterwards allowed to go out of
<HI>Toledo,</HI> and that this unfortunate Prince might
ju&s;tly complain, <HI>That if the French Neighbour|hood
was a &s;moke that drove him from his Hou&s;e
with tears in his eyes, the Spani&s;h Friend&s;hip was
a fire that burnt him alive.</HI> Which if we may be|lieve
publick report, was his own expre&s;&s;ion to
the Captain that guarded him. All that hath
been given out of the cau&s;es of his impri&s;on|ment
hath divulged but part of the mi&s;tery, and
I &s;ought at <HI>Madrid</HI> to inform my &s;elf of the real
<PB N="105" REF="57">
motive. They which &s;peak and judge mo&s;t &s;o|lidly
&s;ay, <HI>That this was rather done on account of
rea&s;on of State, and to &s;pare money, than that he
had indeed be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">raied his party;</HI> and truly the taking
quarters in the Land of <HI>Liege</HI> that Winter, ren|dred
him no more culpable that year, then his
&s;eeking them at his Swords point had done in
tho&s;e that went before: but the conjuncture dif|fered,
and the Elector of <HI>Cullen,</HI> who had made
him&s;elf ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter of that people, de&s;irous to
give them a more powerful protection, clamored
much at the Diet of <HI>Ratisbonne,</HI> from whence,
as misfortune would have it, he retired di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied
with the Emperour, for having decided to the
advantage of him of <HI>Mentz,</HI> the Di&s;pute that
was between them about the Function of crown|ing
the King of Romans. As &s;oon as he arrived
at <HI>Cullen,</HI> he wrote to the Emperour, that
without &s;peedy &s;uccors, according to the Laws of
the Empire, to free his Countrey from the deva|&s;tations
of the Lorrainers, he mu&s;t have recour&s;e
to the protection of &s;ome foraign Prince. This
Affair being taken into con&s;ideration, the Em|perour
only wrote about it to <HI>Bru&s;&s;elles</HI> and <HI>Ma|drid.</HI>
The Elector in the mean time took heat,
and re&s;olving no longer to expect the event of
tho&s;e delays, rai&s;ed forces, treated with <HI>France,</HI>
and gave her opportunity of re-a&s;&s;uming the
Black Eagle in her Colours, and renuing the
Title of <HI>Pre&s;erver of the German Liberty.</HI> Car|dinal
<HI>Mazzarin,</HI> who during his retirement
had been &s;o well received by this Elector, lo&s;t
not the opportunity of making his acknowledg|ments,
<PB N="106" REF="58">
and &s;ent him Troops under the Com|mand
of Mon&s;ieur <HI>Faber,</HI> which joyned to his
own, forced the Lorrainers to di&s;camp, whom
it was re&s;olved to pur&s;ue even into <HI>Brabant,</HI> to
revenge the havock they had made in the Land
of <HI>Liege,</HI> and a&s;&s;i&s;t the French in &s;ome Con|que&s;t.
I his bold proceeding, awaked the Em|perors
jealou&s;ie, who perceived that in that ve|ry
moment he had re-e&s;tabli&s;hed his Authority
in the Empire, and when he had given an end to
a Diet, in which he had cau&s;ed his Son to be
crowned King of Romans, one of the power|fulle&s;t
Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> &s;ought other pro|tection
than his, and gave example to all his
Neighbours to do the like, as often as they
&s;hould be oppre&s;&s;ed by Troops entertained by
<HI>Spain.</HI> The&s;e con&s;iderations obliged the Em|perour
to &s;end the Earl of <HI>Fur&s;temberg</HI> to the
Elector of <HI>Cullen,</HI> to work him, and prevent
his going farther in the Treaty with the French,
promi&s;ing him an effectual and real &s;atisfaction
for what was pa&s;&s;ed, and for the future to e&s;ta|bli&s;h
&s;uch order, he &s;hould no more need to ap|prehend
the like vi&s;its. At the &s;ame time he
wrote to <HI>Madrid</HI> and <HI>Bru&s;&s;elles,</HI> with all po&s;&s;i|ble
efficacy, to repre&s;ent the dangerous con&s;e|quences
of this Affair, how prejudicial it was
to him, and nece&s;&s;ity of the remedies he pro|po&s;ed,
which were to &s;atisfie the Elector of
<HI>Cullen</HI> with Money, &s;o to oblige him to lay
down Arms and di&s;mi&s;s the French, to make
&s;ure of the per&s;on of the Duke of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> that
he might be no le&s;s &s;o of his Conduct, the cau&s;e
<PB N="107" REF="58">
of all the&s;e inconveniences, and to u&s;e his Bro|ther
Duke <HI>Francis</HI> for continuing the Army in
the Spani&s;h Service, which he thought might
ea&s;ily be prevailed upon, by giving it a Head of
the &s;ame Family, and pre&s;enting the Chief Offi|cers
with money. The&s;e rea&s;ons and expedients
were the better relli&s;hed by the Spani&s;h Mini|&s;ters,
out of apprehen&s;ion of the Storm that
began to gather again&s;t them. The great
Services the Duke had rendered the Hou&s;e of
<HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> were of no advantage to him in their
Council, nor any thing examined but his avari|tious
and unequal Politicks, his irre&s;olutions a|lone
were repre&s;ented, and the times in which
he had declined their Service, when they might
have obtained great advantages, if he would
have acted with his forces.</P>
<P>The accompt was al&s;o ca&s;t up of the great
Sums he had co&s;t the King of <HI>Spain</HI> yearly, by
a crafty &s;elling him his Army as if at an outcry,
&s;o that if they would make u&s;e of it in the be|ginning
of a Campagne, or continue it at the
end of it, he mu&s;t be paid at his own rates. It
was at la&s;t concluded as well at <HI>Madrid</HI> as <HI>Bru&s;|&s;elles,</HI>
that for a certain remedy to all the&s;e mi&s;|chiefs,
to prevent falling again into the like in|conveniences,
and put a &s;top to the preparati|ons
making at <HI>Liege,</HI> the Elector was not only
to be indemnified, and the protection of the
Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> abandoned, but his per&s;on to
be &s;ei&s;ed on and &s;ent into <HI>Spain.</HI> Thus this
Prince &s;aw him&s;elf treated as a Soldier of for|tune,
and not like a Soveraign, by a Family
<PB N="108" REF="59">
who&s;e friend&s;hip cau&s;ed the lo&s;s of his Countrey,
and reduced him to the &s;ad nece&s;&s;ity of living
like a vagabond at the Head of an Army that
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted only by his indu&s;try. If what hath
been reported of the fir&s;t heats of his youth be
true, and that he then lamented he was not born
a private Gentleman, to try how far his wit and
courage could carry him; one would think he
had deve&s;ted him&s;elf of his Dominions, only to
&s;hew what he could do without them. That he
had very eminent parts, is undeniable, but over|&s;hadowed
by &s;uch uncouth Policies, and in &s;uch
a manner intermixed with humor and vanity,
that one would think he had but one Maxime
&s;acred and inviolable to him, <HI>To prefer what
was profitable above what was honourable or hone&s;t.</HI>
It is not therefore &s;trange that he built his ruin
on &s;o bad foundations, nor that after his imita|tion
of that crafty <HI>Lewis</HI> the Moor Duke of <HI>Mi|lan,</HI>
and all his &s;hifts and &s;lights of hand, he is
caught in a trap, from whence his deliverance
is very incertain, and whether he end not his
dayes in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Toledo,</HI> as the other did
in the Tower of <HI>Loches;</HI> though it is believed
here, that were his Army disbanded, his liberty
might be obtained without much difficulty, be|cau&s;e
the Spaniards are confident they need ap|prehend
nothing from this Prince, who loves
his money too well to employ it in his revenge,
and the 200 thou&s;and Livres a year he is report|ed
to have within the Dominions of the King of
<HI>Spain</HI> to forfeit them. To which they adde,
that were he de&s;irous to take Arms, he needs the
<PB N="109" REF="59">
&s;upport of <HI>France,</HI> which he will probably fail
of obtaining, without an entire giving up <HI>Lor|rain,</HI>
which they will either keep &s;till, or re|&s;tore
on conditions but little better, and &s;uch as
he will never accept, for fear of depriving him|&s;elf
of what belongs to him for &s;o &s;mall an ad|vancement
towards his particular &s;atisfaction.
On the&s;e grounds they adde, that even the Mi|ni&s;ters
of <HI>Spain</HI> wi&s;h the de&s;truction of his Ar|my,
which in the fa&s;hion it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts and is di&s;ci|plined,
co&s;ts them very dear, but they would
gladly gather together its ruins, and incorporate
them with their other Troops, that their Ene|mies
might not profit by them, the fear of
which hinders their undertaking it. This makes
evident that Princes are incommoded by Auxi|liary
forces that &s;erve in a Body, and under a
Head they own as their ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter, for it
is alwayes hard to oblige them to do well, and
no le&s;s difficult to disband or be quit of them,
and therefore the wi&s;e&s;t Princes, that have been
nece&s;&s;itated to make u&s;e of &s;uch, have at fir&s;t
endeavoured to &s;eparate and mix them with
their own, to prevent their corre&s;pondence,
and dimini&s;h the Authority of tho&s;e that
brought them. The Venetians once endeavo|red
to deal in this manner with the Marquis of
<HI>Roquelaure,</HI> and the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> at relie|ving
<HI>Berghen ap Zome,</HI> would have obliged
<HI>Mansfelt</HI> to &s;uffer &s;uch a &s;eparation: but nei|ther
of them would con&s;ent, but made ap|pear
that this is not to be propounded or ob|tained,
but of a Soldier of fortune, that hath
<PB N="110" REF="60">
drawn together forces he is not able to make
&s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t publick curio&s;ity, whil&s;t we were in
<HI>Spain,</HI> was to divine the de&s;ignes of that Fleet
<HI>Cromwel</HI> &s;ent into the <HI>Indies,</HI> and at our arrival
at <HI>Vittoria,</HI> being &s;aluted by a man of good pre|&s;ence,
who enquired what was &s;poken of it in
the parts we came from, when we told him it
was believed tho&s;e great preparations were made
to &s;ubdue the I&s;le of <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> he a&s;&s;ured us
that if the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> began there they would fail
of &s;ucce&s;s, that he knew that Country very well,
having lived &s;ome time in it, and that this I&s;land
was one of the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t populous of
<HI>America.</HI> That after the year 1586, in which <HI>St.
Domingo</HI> (its Capital City) was &s;acked by Sir
<HI>Francis Drake,</HI> it was put in &s;uch a po&s;ture as
could no more apprehend the like misfortune,
and a very fair Citadel rai&s;ed adjoyining to it,
who&s;e &s;cituation is &s;o advantageous, it &s;eems,
de&s;tined to command the neighbouring Sea.
When we came to <HI>Madrid,</HI> I found that tho&s;e
little Cabals, as well of <HI>Spaniards</HI> as Strangers,
that met a Mornings in the fir&s;t Court of the Pa|lace,
u&s;ually entertained them&s;elves with the a&s;|&s;urances
<HI>Cromwel</HI> had given the Spani&s;h Amba&s;|&s;ador,
that the Fleet he had &s;ent into the <HI>Indies</HI>
&s;hould attempt nothing again&s;t his King: that
they therefore made no que&s;tion but it was to
drive the <HI>French</HI> out of what they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in
<HI>New France,</HI> and that it was there he would be|gin
a Warre again&s;t them, and break that Trea|ty
of Peace from which he had often declined,
<PB N="111" REF="60">
and again complied with, the better to amu&s;e
them. But the clear &s;ighted ea&s;ily judged &s;o con|&s;iderable
preparations aimed not at &s;o &s;light a
Conque&s;t. Computing his charge, they found
that all the <HI>French</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, whether I&s;lands or
Continent in tho&s;e quarters was not equivalent
to any con&s;iderable part of his expences, and
therefore concluded he had &s;ome va&s;ter and
more important de&s;ign. The&s;e men &s;eemed to
me to flatter them&s;elves lea&s;t, and to be mo&s;t
rea&s;onable, for I had often heard &s;uch as had
negotiated with <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;ay, that if they had
any judgement, they a&s;&s;ured them&s;elves they mi|&s;took
not in this ob&s;ervation, that he had a par|ticular
pa&s;&s;ion for &s;ome great Enterpri&s;e in the
<HI>Indies.</HI> After he had made all <HI>Europe</HI> admire
and fear his Naval Power by a War again&s;t <HI>Hol|land,</HI>
which yet was more glorious than profi|table
to his Country, it is probable he contri|ved
how to imploy his arms in &s;ome part where
he might reimbur&s;s part of his charges. Although
of all his Neighbours he at that time u&s;ed the
<HI>French</HI> wor&s;t; yet it may ea&s;ily be judged it was
not his intere&s;t to come to an entire rupture with
them; becau&s;e their Traffick for the mo&s;t part
making u&s;e either of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Holland</HI> Ve&s;&s;els,
he &s;hould by that means di&s;plea&s;e either his own
Merchants, or tho&s;e with whom he had lately
made peace, be&s;ides that the <HI>French</HI> had for &s;ome
years been Ma&s;ters at free-booting again&s;t whom
if he &s;ent a Fleet, they would ea&s;ily avoid it, their
de&s;ign being only to pillage; &s;o that he &s;hould
be at a great charge again&s;t them that would al|wayes
<PB N="112" REF="61">
flye from him, and waiting for his Mer|chants,
oblige him to convoy's; unle&s;s he would
lo&s;e all the Trade of the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and part
of that of the Ocean. <HI>Cromwels</HI> intere&s;t there|fore
requiring a War, and a War by &s;ea, that
may yield him profit proportionable to the great
equipage of Men, Arms, and Ships he is obliged
to maintain, to make him&s;elf feared, by which
he hath obtained the Command of both Seas, he
will not attaque <HI>France,</HI> who having all within
her &s;elf, waits till Strangers bring home to her
that &s;he can be without, and fetch from her
that which is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to them. For
it hath been ob&s;erved that her greate&s;t and weal|thie&s;t
Cities are not &s;cituated near the &s;ea
(though two wa&s;h her Coa&s;ts) but in the middle
of the Country. By this appears that her Stock
of wealth is within her &s;elf, and that (according
to the Polititians rule) &s;he is rather <HI>Vendax</HI> than
<HI>Emax,</HI> &s;elling more than &s;he buys. Her &s;oil
being &s;o rich and fertil, it is no wonder &s;he hath
in all times abandoned the Ocean to be plough'd
by her Neighbours, who employ a great part of
their art and labour to &s;end her as tribute the
fruits of it. To make a war therefore again&s;t
<HI>France</HI> with profit, it mu&s;t mo&s;t certainly be
done by land; but if we con&s;ider the pre&s;ent
condition of <HI>England,</HI> a War of this nature &s;eems
not to agree with it; for we may ea&s;ily judge
that <HI>Englands</HI> de&s;ign now aims at no more then
to maintain her &s;elf in her pre&s;ent po&s;ture, and
to become redoubtable to all the Princes of <HI>Eu|rope</HI>
by a power &s;uitable to her &s;cituation, which
<PB N="113" REF="61">
hinders their attempting any thing again&s;t her,
and obliges them (though again&s;t their wills) to
approve what hath pa&s;&s;ed, by owning her Re|publick.
To this purpo&s;e &s;he re&s;olves to be con|tinually
potently armed both at home and a|broad,
one of which puts her in a condition to
concern her &s;elf in all the affairs of her Neigh|bours,
without their interpo&s;ing in hers, whil&s;t
&s;he is invironed by a prodigious number of in|vincible
moving Ca&s;tles, which when &s;he plea|&s;es
&s;he joyns for her defence, and cau&s;es to fly
for her advantage to what part &s;oever &s;eems
good to her; by the other &s;he thinks &s;ecurely
to fix her innovated tyranny, in continual dan|ger
of an in&s;urrection of the people, to re&s;train
whom her Militia is a curb, as it is lightening to
de&s;troy tho&s;e that attempt to war upon her. In
fine &s;he can make u&s;e of the&s;e winged cour&s;ers
both near hand and at a di&s;tance, and nothing
confining them to her Coa&s;ts, where there will
always remain enow; for Guards and Rounds
exact enough to ju&s;tifie her <HI>Media in&s;uperabilis
unda,</HI> the re&s;t may &s;eek their fortune abroad,
and either wait for the <HI>Indian</HI> Trea&s;ures in their
way to <HI>Spain,</HI> or &s;eize them in their mines. But
it is not thus with her land-forces&punc; who mu&s;t
ever be at home to keep up her u&s;urped power,
which will be hazarded by the fir&s;t &s;hock &s;he re|ceives
from the many male-contents that have
much ado to &s;uffer her.</P>
<P>A War by land mu&s;t needs therefore be preju|dicial
to <HI>England</HI> in the pre&s;ent Conjuncture,
and with <HI>France</HI> de&s;tructive, it being the mo&s;t
<PB N="114" REF="62">
potent Nation of Chri&s;tendom in this age, its
Forces the mo&s;t united, and that may with the
greate&s;t ea&s;e be drawn to any part where there
&s;hall be occa&s;ion for them, &s;o that it cannot be
attacqued, but by great and courageous Armies;
of which if this pretended Republick make u&s;e,
&s;he mu&s;t disfurni&s;h her &s;elf of her tru&s;tie&s;t Com|manders,
and &s;toute&s;t Souldiers, which &s;he can|not
do without danger of lo&s;ing her new form of
Government. Neither is it very much to the
purpo&s;e to &s;ay, that for &s;ecuring it &s;he can make
new Levies, to &s;upply the places of the old ones
&s;he &s;ends abroad; for to an un&s;ettled power,
&s;upported only by the boldne&s;s of the U&s;urpers
that rai&s;ed it, &s;uch a change is very dangerous.
It cannot be denied that <HI>England</HI> uniting with
<HI>Spain</HI> would turn the ballance that way; but be|&s;ides
that, to do &s;o would be of little advantage
to her, there would be an incounter of the &s;ame
inconveniencies. For &s;he mu&s;t either joyn her
Forces to theirs, and then <HI>France</HI> that is &s;o great
a nur&s;ery of Souldiers, having put an end to its
civil warre, minding only that which is forraign,
would not need much to &s;train it &s;elf to oppo&s;e
Armies belonging to &s;everal Ma&s;ters, and of di|vers
intere&s;ts, which &s;eldom &s;ucceed in any thing
they undertake; or el&s;e &s;end an Army of her
own, again&s;t which <HI>France</HI> would immediately
unite all its power, and be the mean while only
on the defen&s;ive again&s;t <HI>Spain,</HI> who to make a
thrifty u&s;e of &s;uch a conjuncture, would move
but &s;lowly and weakly to a&s;si&s;t her. However
&s;he might proceed, this is mo&s;t certain, &s;he
<PB N="115" REF="62">
would be con&s;trained to weaken her Land For|ces,
the only Supporters of that New Repub|lick.
Should &s;he act only by Sea, and furni&s;h
the Spaniards with Money, to recruit their Ar|mies,
it hath been already &s;hewed &s;he would
make no advantage by the former, and that a
War attended by &s;uch Booty and Conque&s;t as
may countervail the charge and labour is only
proper for her: for the &s;econd, it is &s;ufficiently
known that the Trea&s;ure of <HI>England</HI> is much ex|hau&s;ted,
and that &s;he owes large &s;ums both to
her Land and Sea Forces; and that to prevent
her over-charging her People, by the great Ex|pence
&s;he is obliged to, the Gold of <HI>Peru</HI> is
more nece&s;&s;ary to her, then to &s;upply from her
own Trea&s;ury tho&s;e that are Ma&s;ters of it.</P>
<P>During the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, Letters came to
<HI>Madrid</HI> that cleared all Doubts, for after a long
amu&s;ing the World with expectation of the Fleet
and the great Trea&s;ure it was to bring with it,
and after knowledge that what was on the prin|cipal
Gallion, which had been wracked, was
for the mo&s;t part &s;aved, a rumor aro&s;e that it
had been met with by the Engli&s;h, who made
no difficulty of attacquing it, but that after a
vigorous defence, in which it &s;unk two or three
of their Ships, it had retired into the <HI>Havana,</HI>
the Chief City of the I&s;le of <HI>Cuba.</HI> I know
not whether this particular was true, but am
certain it was written from <HI>Cadis</HI> and <HI>Sevil,</HI> and
from that time believed that <HI>Cromwell</HI> intended
to have his &s;hare of the Trea&s;ure of the <HI>Indies.</HI>
More to confirm this, the Engli&s;h Merchants
<PB N="116" REF="63">
that re&s;ided in <HI>Spain,</HI> began to &s;end away, and
as well as they could to conceal their Goods,
fearing a Confi&s;cation in ca&s;e of Rupture; a lit|tle
after which it appeared that this Pre-caution
was not u&s;ele&s;s, for Admiral <HI>Blake</HI> who had pa&s;|&s;ed
the Spring and part of the Summer in the
<HI>Mediterranean,</HI> returned into the Ocean ju&s;t at
the time the Gallions were expected. It is &s;aid
he de&s;ired to careen, which not being permit|ted,
but on certain conditions, he &s;eemed of|fended;
and having taken aboard him &s;everal
Engli&s;h Merchants with their Con&s;ul, put out
to Sea, and &s;couted about Cape St <HI>Vincent.</HI> It
was then quickly under&s;tood that he looked for
the Gallions, with intention to fight them if
they e&s;caped <HI>Pen</HI> and <HI>Venables,</HI> who were in the
<HI>Indies;</HI> this cau&s;ed &s;everal Advice Boats to be
di&s;patched from <HI>Cadis</HI> by Order of the Council
in <HI>Madrid,</HI> to give notice to the Gallions that
they &s;hould not leave the Haven they were reti|red
to, till farther Order: at the &s;ame time a re|&s;olution
was taken to fit up &s;ome Ships, partly at
the Kings Charge, and partly at that of the Mer|chants,
that were concerned to watch the moti|ons
of this Admiral. Great part of the Traf|fick
of <HI>Europe</HI> depending on the arrival of the
Gallions, many Ships are ever about <HI>Cadis</HI> at
the time it is expected. Of the&s;e and &s;ome o|thers
a Fleet was quickly made ready, and &s;ent
to anchor near <HI>Blake,</HI> yet without ho&s;tility, if
the other began not, and only to endeavour
(in ca&s;e the Gallions had not received the ad|vice
&s;ent them) to &s;ecure them from him. The&s;e
<PB N="117" REF="63">
two Fleets contemplated one another two or
three moneths without any act of ho&s;tility, either
general or particular, and while&s;t one of them
thus waited for his prey, and the other to &s;ecure
it from him, news came that the <HI>Spane&s;h</HI> Fleet
was adverti&s;ed of the de&s;ign again&s;t it, and would
not leave the Haven it had retired into without
expre&s;s order. At the &s;ame time al&s;o it was &s;aid
that <HI>Pen</HI> and <HI>Venables</HI> had attacqued <HI>St. Domin|go,</HI>
but with &s;o bad &s;ucce&s;s, that after lo&s;s of
many of their men, they went off for the I&s;land
of <HI>Jamaica</HI> and conquered it.</P>
<P>This proceeding of <HI>Cromwell</HI> changed the di&s;|cour&s;es
of tho&s;e that looked on him as one of the
neare&s;t and faithfulled Allies of <HI>Spain,</HI> who had
fir&s;t of all acknowledged him: For as &s;oon as an
execrable Party of the &s;cum of this Nation, vio|lating
all Laws divine and humane, had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
them&s;elves of its Government, and (by an at|tempt
&s;o horrible it cannot be paralelled in fore|going
times, nor &s;carce mi&s;tru&s;ted in the wor&s;t
that &s;hall &s;ucceed) at one &s;troke deprived their
King of his Crown and head, the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;ador
received order from <HI>Madrid</HI> to endea|vour
to make advantage by it, and court the
friend&s;hip of that new Republick for his Ma&s;ter,
by giving it in his name all &s;uch titles and rights
of a legitimate Power as it &s;hould de&s;ire: it was
very likely he might &s;ucceed in this, there being
probability enough of a league again&s;t <HI>France,</HI>
who not only received the exiled Family of the
King of <HI>England,</HI> and refu&s;ed to own <HI>Cromwell,</HI>
but &s;ei&s;ed all his Ships, and gave freedom of
<PB N="118" REF="64">
his Havens to tho&s;e that remained faithful to
their King.</P>
<P>The hopes of &s;o advantageous a Treaty in|crea&s;ed
in <HI>Madrid,</HI> not only by <HI>Englands</HI> giving
Letters of Repri&s;al again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> and landing
forces ho&s;tilely in <HI>Bretaigne,</HI> but by her being &s;o
kind to <HI>Spain,</HI> that &s;he cau&s;ed her Fleet to take
tho&s;e &s;hips <HI>France</HI> &s;ent to &s;uccour <HI>Dunkirk</HI> be|&s;ieged
by it. All the&s;e fair appearances of Amity
proved in&s;ignificant, and the U&s;urper that governs
in <HI>England,</HI> who &s;eems no le&s;s crafty than bold
&s;o well under&s;tands the intere&s;ts of his infant
Republick, that he by degrees accommodates all
to them.</P>
<P>She is Mi&s;tri&s;s of many &s;trong and populous
I&s;ies &s;cituated on the pa&s;&s;age to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and
that are keys to to the Gates that may lay open
a way to &s;o rich a Conque&s;t, by means of
which, &s;he may &s;urprize its trea&s;ures as they
pa&s;s by, if &s;he will not take the pains to dig
them out of the Mines, of which &s;he may cer|tainly
make her &s;elf Mi&s;tri&s;s: &s;he knows that
all the great extent of Land the Spaniards po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
there, adheres to their Dominion, more
out of apprehen&s;ion of their violence, and be|cau&s;e

thus under&s;tanding the advantages &s;he hath
towards getting her &s;hare of the new world,

&s;he endeavor to profit by both of them; e&s;pe|cially

in a time, where they which &s;it at Helme

employ their many Fleets in &s;ome profitable
war, that may make them &s;ub&s;i&s;t without the
peoples murmuring at their great charge in en|tertaining
them: and the Spaniards, as quick
&s;ighted in their politicks, as &s;low paced in their
enterprizes, very well fore&s;ee, that if the French
Negotiations with <HI>Cromwel</HI> effect a peace be|tween
them, he will pur&s;ue his intere&s;t, and
forget all advances <HI>Spain</HI> hath made to gain his
friend&s;hip, This they think they ought the firm|lier
to believe, when they remember they could
never get &s;atisfaction for &s;everal prizes ta|ken
by the Engli&s;h, e&s;pecially, for the money
de&s;igned for a whole Campagne which they
&s;ent by &s;ea to <HI>Flanders,</HI> not knowing how to
make it over by Bills of Exchange, by rea&s;on
of their difference with <HI>Genoua:</HI> however, that
they might not in &s;o con&s;iderable a conjuncture,
be wanting to them&s;elves, and out of con&s;ide|ration
of the advice, <HI>Philip</HI> the II gave his Son
at his death, to be in peace with <HI>England,</HI> that
he might be able to make a war with all the

<HI>Cromwel</HI> to a good under&s;tanding with
them. <HI>Alfon&s;o de Cardenas</HI> their Amba&s;&s;ador in
<HI>England,</HI> and who having re&s;ided there &s;ince
the beginning of the troubles, is looked on as
very able in manageing tho&s;e affairs, endeavour|ed
all means of a good under&s;tanding, and to
thwart the French Treaty&punc; but his politicks be|ing
apprehended at <HI>Madrid,</HI> to be le&s;s under|taking
<PB N="120" REF="65">
then tho&s;e of <HI>de Bourdeaux</HI> the French
Amba&s;&s;ador; a re&s;olution was taken to &s;end thi|ther

two per&s;ons joyned all their adre&s;s to bring
<HI>Cromwel</HI> to &s;ome friendly compo&s;ure of dif|ferences
about the complaints the Spaniards
made again&s;t him, and his again&s;t them; but
finding no favourable Audience of their many
propo&s;als, the la&s;t of the&s;e re&s;olved to be gone,
with regret, to have done nothing for his Ma|&s;ters
&s;ervice, but to have given him clearer light
of <HI>Cromwels</HI> bad intentions again&s;t him: it there|fore
began to be more publickly di&s;cour&s;ed in
<HI>Madrid;</HI> that the many delays in his Negoti|ation
with <HI>France,</HI> were but tricks to lull the
Spaniard a&s;leep, whil&s;t he &s;ent to attacque his
<HI>Indies;</HI> and that the Treaty which he &s;ome|times
&s;eemed ready to break off, and again to
renew, had been agreed on, and privately &s;ign|ed
three moneths before. <HI>Spain</HI> now beleeved
<HI>England</HI> intended a breach with her, and though
the pa&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Ca&s;tilians,</HI> inveighed &s;harp|ly
again&s;t the avarice and ambition of <HI>Cromwel,</HI>
which moved him to invade their Trea&s;ure;
the moderate &s;ort rea&s;oned otherwi&s;e, and in
what was pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ought the cau&s;es of what was
pre&s;ent and to come. But by &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es, one
could not judge of the whole &s;ecret, or entire
cau&s;e of the war they apprehended&punc; the thoughts
of &s;uch as &s;it at the Helme of Government be|ing
covered with a cloud of appearances, which
di&s;gui&s;e them even to tho&s;e that have the neare&s;t
<PB N="121" REF="65">
pro&s;pect; for the mo&s;t part di&s;covering nothing
but the pretences; their actions being like great
Rivers, of which, though the &s;treams are view|ed
by all, the heads are inv&s;iible. They yet
at la&s;t ea&s;ily per&s;waded them&s;elves, that whil&s;t
their King had &s;o many irons in the fire, that
he knew not where to find either Wood or
Coals to heat them, <HI>Cromwel</HI> would make u&s;e of
the occa&s;ion to attacque him both in the new
and old world, where expecting little re&s;i&s;tance,
he needed not doubt of a certain profit, more
con&s;iderable to him then the jealou&s;ie of the
French progre&s;&s;ions or cautions given by the
maxime, <HI>Decre&s;eat Iberus nec cre&s;cat Gallus.</HI></P>
<P>On the&s;e grounds they concluded, that <HI>Crom|wel</HI>
fearing a peace between <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI>
and &s;tanding in need of an advantagious war to
ju&s;tfy his continuing in Arms, would attacque
the weake&s;t, and let the future &s;afety of his e&s;tate
giue way to the pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity, and on that
account agree with <HI>France,</HI> that he might &s;hare
in her victories by leaving Land enterprizes to
her, and applying him&s;elf to tho&s;e of the &s;ea,
which better &s;uit with his affairs and the &s;up|port
of his power.</P>

Countreys that have made no Treaty or Com|pact,
may be a&s;&s;aulted by them that on other
accounts are in peace with tho&s;e which appropri|ate

in all Treaties he ever made with the Kings
his neighbors, declared, that whoever goes to
the <HI>Indies,</HI> either to &s;ettle or traffick, not be|ing
natural Spaniards, &s;hall be u&s;ed as enemies,
cannot complain of &s;uch acts of ho&s;tility, as are
made by other nations, &s;ince him&s;elf hath cho|&s;en
a perpetual State of war, owning neither
friend nor ally beyond the Line, e&s;pecially in
<HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e the an&s;wer of a great <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>
Mini&s;ter is remarkable, rallying on two healthes
were drank to him, one to his Ma&s;ters Wife, the o|ther
to his Mi&s;tre&s;s: <HI>America</HI> &s;ays he, is my Ma&s;ters
wife, and the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> his Mi&s;tre&s;s; for the later
he is not &s;o jealous as to think him&s;elf concern|in
honor, if any of his friends too freely care&s;s
her; but his Wife he would keep cha&s;te and re|re&s;erved,
without &s;uffering any to court her.
Que&s;tionle&s;s when he called <HI>America</HI> his Ma&s;ters
Wife, he alluded to the Popes Bull, which gave
him power and propriety in this intended Mar|riage;
but it is generally &s;aid that a Rape merits
not &s;uch a benediction, &s;ince he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es <HI>Ameri|ca</HI>
without either her own con&s;ent, or that of
her relations, <HI>Europe, Africa,</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;peak &s;eriou&s;ly, the Popes donation is a
ridiculous title to tho&s;e that own not his Au|thority;
be&s;ides, that a great number of tho&s;e
<PB N="123" REF="66">
that do, believe not that it extends to things of
this nature; &s;o that if <HI>Spain</HI> have no other right
than what is derived from <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;he is not well
inve&s;ted in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the new world, nei|ther
can they which di&s;pute it again&s;t her be ac|cu&s;ed
of inju&s;tice, &s;ince &s;ome of them &s;ay they
owe him no obedience, and others that he can|not
di&s;po&s;e of that which belongs not to him.
Nothing then appropriates it to <HI>Spain</HI> but the
fir&s;t di&s;covery, to have landed Colonies here
and there, to have built Cities and Fortere&s;&s;es,
&s;ubdued the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> and given names to Ri|vers
and Havens: But all this cannot have ac|quired
a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion ab&s;olutely general, and with|out
exception; and &s;ince it made its &s;ei&s;ure by
the law of &s;uch things as are <HI>Nullius &amp; quae fiunt
primi occupantis,</HI> it hath right to no more than
it inhabits, cultivates, and hath entirely con|quered.
Any Nation may with ju&s;tice take his
part of the remainder, and <HI>(Spain</HI> going about
to hinder) make u&s;e of force, and by force drive
away him that hath &s;ettled him&s;elf only by
force.</P>
<P>When <HI>Philip</HI> the &s;econd fortified him&s;elf by
the Popes Bull, for invading <HI>England,</HI> he added
to that title the mo&s;t con&s;iderable forces that had
ever appeared on the Ocean: What is &s;piritual
thus &s;tands in need of what is temporal, one of
them well &s;econding the other, without which
admirable conjunction it is very hard to &s;ei&s;e
what belongs to others.</P>
<P>The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Council &s;pared neither wit nor
indu&s;try, nor the wealth of the whole Kingdom
<PB N="124" REF="67">
for this redoubted Fleet, in which they neg|lected
not to &s;end fetters to en&s;lave the Inhabi|tants
of <HI>Great Britain:</HI> but their Forces both
&s;piritual and temporal had very ill &s;ucce&s;s, and
that prodigious Navy which could hardly be
compleated in two years, was lo&s;t in two hours;
part of it the &s;ea &s;wallowed, and the re&s;t fell
into the hands of tho&s;e it went to &s;ubdue, and
of all that proud Armado, &s;car&s;e any e&s;caped to
carry the &s;ad news into their Country: by which
it is very di&s;cernable that Heaven does not al|wayes
corre&s;pond with the vi&s;ible Head of the

<HI>Indians,</HI> becau&s;e Barbarians, one would think
it ought to be re&s;tored as they become Chri&s;ti|ans;

to recovery of their Country; and the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
very exactly imitate Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks in their ac|qui&s;itions,
like &s;o many di&s;membrings of the Pa|trimonies
of the Laity, from whom what&s;oever
is taken returns no more; and if they well keep
what they have once laid hands on, they can as
well cau&s;e them&s;elves to be obeyed. Their Em|pire
is formidable, and he that doubts of this
truth, may be convinced of it in their Cloy&s;ters,
where &s;uch religious per&s;ons as have neither
dignity or parts to &s;et them out, are rather
Slaves than Brothers in Chri&s;t to the other. If
within their walls they exerci&s;e &s;o ab&s;olute a
power, on tho&s;e which are as it were their fel|low
pri&s;oners, and make the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion,
what will they not do to &s;uch as are of a diffe|rent
condition, if they obtain the authority they
<PB N="125" REF="67">
de&s;ire, and which &s;ome of them know &s;o well
how to make advantage of under pretence of
Religion and directing con&s;ciences, without fear
of puni&s;hment, for&s;aking the functions of legiti|mate
Confe&s;&s;ors, to creep into Families, and
make them&s;elves arbitrators of their affairs and
intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>But to return to this Papal Donation, it is ve|ry
clear, that this imaginary propriety of a world
as yet not well known, and of which probably
not &s;o much is hitherto di&s;covered as we are ig|norant
of, cannot, nor ought not to hinder o|ther
people from trafficking there, becau&s;e it
belongs to the fir&s;t finder, and that the <HI>Spani|ards</HI>
acquired tho&s;e parts of it they po&s;&s;e&s;s, with|out
any con&s;ent of other Nations to enjoy the
propriety and &s;overaignty of the whole as heirs
of it.</P>
<P>If then the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> now attacque the <HI>Spaniards</HI>
in the <HI>Indies,</HI> &s;uch as are ju&s;t acknowledge that
this is not &s;o much to begin as to continue a
War, &s;ince they alwayes (more or le&s;s) mole&s;ted
them there, and that no formal Treaty concern|ing
that Country was ever made with them.
I have heard &s;ome very curious per&s;ons examine
what good or evil might by it accrue to either
of the&s;e Potentates; and they hold that the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> would be the fir&s;t gainers, by an im|mediate
&s;ei&s;ing all that belongs to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in
their Dominion. They would find con&s;iderable
&s;umms in the hands of Merchants of that Nati|on,
as well at <HI>Bilbo, Cadis,</HI> and <HI>Sevil,</HI> as in ma|ny
<PB N="126" REF="68">
other of their Port Towns, which might a&s;&s;i&s;t
them towards the fir&s;t charge of the War.</P>
<P>For we may remember that <HI>England</HI> hath
for many years been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the Trade
of <HI>Spain, Hollanders,</HI> during their War, and the
<HI>French,</HI> &s;ince their breach, trafficking only by
her interpo&s;al. So that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
them&s;elves very con&s;iderably, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
them&s;elves of much wealth in a Country that a|bounds
in money, and is poor in Commodities,
and that cannot receive from its Neighbours
what is nece&s;&s;ary for it but by their hands.</P>
<P>We cannot oppo&s;e again&s;t this Confi&s;cation
of the goods of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants in all parts of
the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Territories, the like to be done to
the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> for as they never go
abroad to &s;erve any forrain Prince in his Wars,
they have a Maxim for &s;ecurity of their Com|merce,
not to exerci&s;e it but in Countries where
their King is Ma&s;ter. They go not therefore a|broad
how great &s;oever their Trade be, but con|tent
them&s;elves to deal at home with Merchants
Strangers, who for want of corre&s;pondence are
forced to &s;ettle among&s;t them, which they do
the more willingly, becau&s;e having to deal with
people not very well under&s;tanding their Com|modies
they make the greater profit.</P>
<P>We &s;ee now the King of <HI>Spain</HI> without danger
of a retaliation of his Subjects&punc; when he &s;hall
&s;ei&s;e what belongs to tho&s;e of <HI>England,</HI> inhabi|ting
here and there in his Dominion: But this
&s;mall and incon&s;iderable advantage, prejudicial
only to private per&s;ons, is not to be compared
<PB N="127" REF="68">
to that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> will obtain, by crui&s;ing in both
&s;eas, and attacquing what ever is &s;ent to <HI>Spain</HI>
from its Neighbours, without which it cannot
without difficulty &s;ub&s;i&s;t. <HI>Genoua, Naples, Am|&s;terdam,</HI>
and <HI>Antwerp,</HI> who&s;e Comerce with it
is &s;o great, will then be able to &s;end little or no|thing
that &s;hall not run hazard of falling into
their hands; and if they ever make Conque&s;ts
in <HI>America,</HI> or take the Plate-fleet (to which it
&s;eems they are forward enough) the <HI>Thames</HI>
will be covered with the &s;poils of both worlds.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e con&s;iderations of particular lo&s;s
one of State is to be added, which is, that by a
War with <HI>England,</HI> the va&s;t and &s;cattered body
of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Monarchy will lo&s;e its ligaments,
and all communication with its remoter Mem|bers.
France leaves her little liberty but by
&s;ea, of which this potent Nation, that attributes
to it &s;elf the Empire of it will deprive her. It
is true, &s;ome object that &s;hift will be made to
open a pa&s;&s;age as was done in her War with <HI>Hol|land,</HI>
but others ob&s;erve great difference be|tween
tho&s;e powers, for be&s;ides that <HI>England</HI> is
&s;o advantageou&s;ly &s;cituated, that it can with|out
difficulty break all corre&s;pondence between
<HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Naval Pow|er
appeared not at its height, till the War was
grown old, and the fir&s;t animo&s;ity decayed, where
as now <HI>Spain</HI> will have to do with a Nation,
that does not rai&s;e forces to fight, but fights to
employ tho&s;e that are already rai&s;ed. Be&s;ides
all which, the King of <HI>Spain</HI> was not then &s;o
drained of men and money, as at pre&s;ent, but
<PB N="128" REF="69">
could &s;et out con&s;iderable Fleets to oppo&s;e the
<HI>Hollanders,</HI> who making Traffick alone the end
of their Navigation, rather &s;ought for them|&s;elves
free pa&s;&s;age through all &s;eas, then to de|prive
their enemies of Communication by them;
and this &s;o much, that though they have &s;ome|times
attempted the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Fleets, and taken
&s;ome of them, we may perceive they were not
very greedy of &s;uch Conque&s;ts, becau&s;e their
own Merchants were concerned, and received
almo&s;t as much prejudice as tho&s;e of <HI>Cadis</HI> or
<HI>Sevil.</HI> It is well known that at the &s;ame time
their &s;hips crui&s;ed up and down to interrupt the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Traffick, their Merchants pa&s;&s;ed and re|pa&s;&s;ed
between <HI>Flanders, Genoua,</HI> and <HI>Naples</HI> in
favour of it, and carried thither the &s;ecrete&s;t in|telligence,
and be&s;t ammunition, whereas in a
War with <HI>England</HI> all will go in a more &s;erious
and real manner, and <HI>Cromwell</HI> little caring to
advance his Nations Trade, will vigourou&s;ly fall
on, and aiming directly at Conque&s;t of the <HI>In|dies,</HI>
endeavor every where to incommode <HI>Spain</HI>
in order to it.</P>
<P>About this time two Books were publi&s;hed in
<HI>Madrid,</HI> which clearly and ingenuou&s;ly di&s;co|vered
the great exigencies of the State. This
was admired by &s;uch as could not imagine a na|tural
<HI>Spaniard</HI> would ever own its &s;pirits &s;pent,
and it in a langui&s;hing condition. The Author
of the fir&s;t was one <HI>Don Philippo Antonio Alo&s;a,</HI>
a Knight of the Order of <HI>Calatrava,</HI> of the
Kings Council, and his Secretary in the Coun|cil
general of the Holy Inqui&s;ition. It contained
<PB N="129" REF="69">
an Exhortation to Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks to &s;upply the
King by voluntary Contributions, in the &s;o very
pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity of his Kingdom; of which
having fir&s;t declared the Cau&s;es, which he deri|ved
from the time when <HI>Philip</HI> the Second en|gaged
almo&s;t all his Revenues, for aiding the
French League and building the E&s;curial, and
repre&s;ented how under <HI>Philip</HI> the Third his Son,
occa&s;ions of expence augmented, by rea&s;on of
the Wars of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> removal of the
Court from <HI>Valladolid</HI> to <HI>Madrid,</HI> with his
great Charges in entertaining the Princes of
<HI>Savoy,</HI> and Reception of the Engli&s;h and
French Amba&s;&s;adors; and that which compleat|ed
the ruin of the State, and drew on it the ex|treme&s;t
mi&s;ery, the rai&s;ing the value of Copper
Money, by which <HI>Sajavedra</HI> &s;ays more mi&s;|chief
happened to <HI>Spain,</HI> than if all the Serpents
and Mon&s;ters of <HI>Africk</HI> had attacked it: he
makes out, that the pre&s;ent King at his Succe&s;|&s;ion
received the Crown &s;o poor, it was admira|ble
there could be found wherewithal to re&s;i&s;t
&s;o many Enemies as at once proclaimed War a|gain&s;t
it; and concludes, that after the many
&s;hocks it hath &s;u&s;tained, it will hardly any long|er
prove able to defend it &s;elf, without recour&s;e
to &s;ome &s;udden &s;upply, though it be u&s;ele&s;s to
fancy New Impo&s;ts, or augmentation of the
old ones, there being a general incapacity in the
&s;ubjects to pay what is already laid upon them.
This pre-&s;uppo&s;ed, he continues that applications
ought to be made to the Clergy only, who have
ever kept their doors open to all manner of
<PB N="130" REF="70">
acqui&s;itions, and clo&s;ely &s;hut again&s;t the lea&s;t
alienation, and who with little or no expence
po&s;&s;e&s;s the greate&s;t wealth of the Kingdom, till
a more learned Pen make evident, they may ju&s;t|ly
be compelled to contribute to the Kings ur|gent
occa&s;io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s, he declares his de&s;ign to be no
more but to oblige them to a voluntary loane,
which he &s;hews will be to their advantage; be|cau&s;e
if the Kings nece&s;&s;ities force him to pre&s;s
the Laity with rigor, they will abandon Tillage
and the Country, in &s;uch manner, that Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical
Rents, deduced only from the hands of
the other by Tythes, and the like, will fail.</P>
<P>Going on he adds that &s;uch a liberality is
more e&s;pecially due to the mo&s;t Catholick King,
who aims only at the Churches good, and re|quires
a&s;&s;i&s;tance for continuing the War only in
order to an advantageous Peace, neither does
he demand any thing that he fir&s;t gave not, all
of them having received their benefices and dig|nities
from his Maje&s;ty as their Patron: That
they need only &s;pare part of their Plate, Jewels,
and rich Moveables, abating &s;omething of their
great Trains, entertained que&s;tionle&s;ly by them,
&s;hew that grandeur, they will more hand&s;omly
make appear by a&s;&s;i&s;ting their King: afterwards
he &s;ayes that to give this greater efficacy, the
King may plea&s;e to make choice of one of his
great Mini&s;ters of State, to whom the Clergy
have &s;ome kind of obligation on account of
their preferments, and from whom they may
rea&s;onably expect more, by his report to the
King and Council of their forwardne&s;s and libe|rality:
<PB N="131" REF="70">
he advi&s;es farther, that addre&s;&s;es be not
made to the Body or Convocation, but to par|ticulars,
and an exact regi&s;ter kept of the wil|linge&s;t,
which will on all occa&s;ions be u&s;eful to
them, towards acquiring greater favors. By
this method, which is nothing el&s;e but a Collecti|on
of State, he &s;uppo&s;es the King may ama&s;s a
con&s;iderable &s;um towards paying his Troops,
that peri&s;h for want, and re-e&s;tabli&s;hing his Af|fairs,
which the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity hath &s;o much
di&s;ordered.</P>
<P>The Second Book was a Memorial drawn up
by a certain Captain called <HI>Jo&s;eph Puteol,</HI> in
which he repre&s;ented to the King, that by
ea&s;ing his people he would be the better en|abled
to make War, <HI>Como a&s;&s;i&s;tiendo &agrave; to|dos
&s;e pue da lograr el hazer mejor la Guerra.</HI></P>
<P>The Expedients he propounded, &s;poke him
a man of parts to &s;uch as knew him not, but in
others prejudice, rai&s;ed a contempt of his rea|&s;ons
becau&s;e he was not in an eminent condition;
as if the validity of a medicine depended on the
quality of the Phy&s;itian, <HI>&amp; aliquando etiam
Olitor commode pote&s;t e&s;&s;e locutus, &amp;c.</HI> but pa&s;sing
by the&s;e, I will here recount what the former
look on as mo&s;t judicious in his Book, which will
al&s;o very much tend to the better under&s;tanding
the condition in which I &s;hall leave <HI>Spain.</HI> Af|ter
particulars of all the Revenues his King draws
from his Kingdoms of <HI>Ca&s;tille</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI>
(which in gro&s;s amount to no more than Eigh|teen
Millions of Gold, and of which <HI>Philip</HI> the
Fourth when he came to the Crown found but
<PB N="132" REF="71">
Eight Millions two hundred &s;eventy four thou|&s;and
Crowns without incumbrances, which to
&s;upply his Wars again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> he was imme|diately
nece&s;&s;itated to engage, and afterwards
to alienate, (for reducing <HI>Catalonia,</HI> appea&s;ing
the troubles of <HI>Naples</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> defence of
the Dutchy of <HI>Millain,</HI> recovery of <HI>Portolon|gone</HI>
and <HI>Piombino,</HI> and many Towns in <HI>Flan|ders;</HI>
be&s;ides a&s;&s;i&s;ting &s;uch Princes as had &s;ided
with him in the French revolutions:) he con|cludes
a very exact and parcimonious oeconomy
for the future to be the only means of repleni&s;h|ing
the Kings Coffers.</P>
<P>The wayes he propo&s;es for this, &s;eem &s;o ma|ny
remarques of the former ill di&s;pen&s;ation and
admini&s;tration of the Publick Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place he &s;ayes, That what is nece&s;|&s;ary
to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of their Armies, fails of
being &s;upplied, not only by rea&s;on of the En|gagement
of the principal Revenues of the
Crown to &s;uch as have furni&s;hed the King in
his nece&s;&s;ities, but no le&s;s by the prodigious
cheats of an infinite number of Officers employ|ed
towards their recovery; which gave the King
ju&s;t cau&s;e to complain to the <HI>Cortes,</HI> That of Ten
Millions paid yearly by <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> &s;ix &s;tuck to the
fingers of Under Trea&s;urers, Secretaries, Recei|vers,
Tellers, and other Exchequer men, that
&s;ub&s;i&s;t only by Rapines exerci&s;ed on the King and
his People.</P>
<P>Then he de&s;ires that difference be made be|tween
Monopoli&s;ts and Farmers of Cu&s;toms,
as well old as new, and that &s;uch of them as
<PB N="133" REF="71">
have dealt franckly, without making malicious
advantage of the nece&s;&s;ity of affairs, may be di|&s;tingui&s;hed
from tho&s;e that have thriven by
craft and de&s;ign, in purcha&s;ing or renting the
Kings Duties. With the fir&s;t he holds it but rea|&s;onable
to make a fair compo&s;ition, and after|wards
that they be permitted the enjoyment of
what they acquired with &s;o great equity: the
other he would have treated with all po&s;&s;ible
&s;everity, and compelled to refund with no le&s;s
rigor than Sorcerers are burnt and Theeves
hanged. For what concerns rewards, he allows
it ju&s;t to recompence all &s;uch as have done the
Crown &s;ervice, be its nece&s;&s;ities never &s;o great;
but even for this he would not have the King
draw any thing from his own Pur&s;e, nor pre|tend
to liberality at a time when he hath not
wherewithal; he therefore advi&s;es (&s;ince high
birth is not ever the &s;ource of eminent actions,
neither do Children alwayes inherit the Pru|dence
and Vertue of their Parents) not to con|tinue
in the &s;ame Families, 49<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> Commanderies,
which the Eight Orders of Spani&s;h Knighthood
po&s;&s;e&s;s, worth above a Million of Gold yearly;
but in&s;tead of be&s;towing them out of favour for
the mo&s;t part to per&s;ons unworthy and u&s;ele&s;s,
hereafter to di&s;tribute them to &s;uch as either
have pre&s;erved or extended the Limits of his
Monarchy, or at lea&s;t by an Honourable Profe&s;|&s;ion
of Arms are in a capacity to do it. And if
he ever &s;uffers any of them to be diverted from
the advantage of Soldiers, to whom only they
of right appertain, that it be to &s;ome able State&s;|man
<PB N="134" REF="72">
or Dextrous Amba&s;&s;ador, who without
drawing Sword, hath &s;aved &s;ome Town or
Countrey, &s;urprized an Enemy, broken in Pie|ces
his Levies, cut off Ammunition and Victual
from his Armies, drawn in Neighboring Prin|ces
to unite again&s;t him, obliged &s;ome of them
to quit a Neutrality, &s;uccored &s;ome Ally, or con|firmed
&s;ome other that wavered; in a word, to
&s;uch a per&s;on who&s;e indu&s;try and prudence hath
been highly advantageous to his King and Coun|trey.
He no le&s;s complains, that in&s;tead of gi|ving
what is &s;ub&s;tantial in the&s;e Orders to Per|&s;ons
of Merit, the very Badges of them, which
are only &s;uperficial, are for the mo&s;t part refu|&s;ed.
He in&s;tances in Mr <HI>de St Maurice,</HI> a Gen|tleman
of <HI>Burgundie,</HI> who after very good &s;er|vice,
pretended &s;everal years without obtaining
this, though Marquis <HI>Caracene</HI> writ in his fa|vour,
and atte&s;ted his Valour and eminent Me|rit.
This takes away his admiration, that in
all the Troops that &s;erve in the Dutchy of <HI>Mil|lain,</HI>
there are but Eight Knights that have this
honour, the peculiar recompence of Soldiers, be|ing
frequently be&s;towed on Pen-men, or &s;uch as
depend more on the Gown than Sword, though
they wear the later, as a Mark of what they
ought to be, rather than of what they really
are. After this detection of abu&s;es in manage|ing
his Kings Trea&s;ure, he pa&s;&s;es to the wayes of
increa&s;ing and better &s;ecuring it. Towards in|crea&s;ing
it, he would have taken into con&s;ide|ration
that <HI>Spain</HI> is inhabited by &s;ome per&s;ons
that are very rich, others indifferently &s;o, the
<PB N="135" REF="72">
re&s;t very poor, which is the greate&s;t number,
and that in rai&s;ing Contributions neither of the&s;e
three can be favoured, without prejudice not
only of the other two, but of the Soveraign
him&s;elf: Such a Geometrical proportion is
therefore to be ob&s;erved, as con&s;iders the means
and faculties of each, and prevents that incon|venience
in the State that often afflicts our Bo|dies,
when all the ill humors fall on the part
that is weake&s;t. After &s;o good a Foundation, he
attacks tho&s;e that po&s;&s;e&s;s mo&s;t and pay lea&s;t,
and makes appear that the Spani&s;h Clergy, being
very wealthy, pays the King but Four hundred
forty &s;even thou&s;and Crowns, a trifle compared
to its ability, and concludes that an augmenta|tion
of the Kings Revenue might in &s;o pre&s;&s;ing a
nece&s;&s;ity be charged on it with all ju&s;tice and
rea&s;on imaginable. He thinks it not fit to impo&s;e
more on the Nobility and Gentry, who ought to
be in a continual po&s;ture to do the King per&s;onal
&s;ervice, but upon Citizens and Farmers, and
concealed Trea&s;ure for the greate&s;t part in the
hands of Per&s;ons faulty or di&s;affected, and that
this might bring up a con&s;iderable aid, were the
&s;ources of their abundance well examined. For
&s;uch Taxes as are &s;ettled ill, he &s;ays that which
is impo&s;ed on the Eighth part of Fle&s;h, Oil, and
Wine, is the wor&s;t of all others, giving occa|&s;ion
to a thou&s;and cheats, as well by the Offi|cers,
as by &s;uch as endeavour to bring tho&s;e
provi&s;ions into <HI>Madrid</HI> and other Towns with|out
paying Duties. To which I can adde, that
I have been a&s;&s;ured, an infinite number live
<PB N="136" REF="73">
only by that imployment, in &s;o much that not
only &s;ome poor Gentlemen and Ranting Hectors
that will live on nothing, and without doing
any thing, with whom Courts and great Cities
ever abound, concern them&s;elves in it; but e|ven
Churchmen and the greate&s;t Noblemen, that
are weakly revenued. For this cau&s;e Guards
have been appointed to attend the Collection
of the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">mpo&s;ts, on condition that what they
can &s;ei&s;e of Goods that have entered without
paying Duties, &s;hall be their own. But this
which was e&s;tabli&s;hed, to redouble their dili|gence,
they have turned into &s;mall Politicks,
that cau&s;ing them to con&s;ider the Kings intere&s;t,
if vigorou&s;ly pur&s;ued, as that which would put
an end to their profits, they are not very exact,
perceiving that &s;hould they not &s;ometimes con|nive,
they which bu&s;ie them&s;elves in &s;tealing
Cu&s;toms, would give over the Trade, finding
no effect but Confi&s;cation of their Goods, after
which the Kings Duties would be well paid, but
they get nothing. They therefore corre&s;pond
with them, and &s;ei&s;e not their Goods, till &s;o
much hath entered, as will make them more
than &s;avers. This Confederacy again&s;t the
King, is maintained at his Charge, and drones
&s;uck the blood of the poor people, the effects
of &s;o great a di&s;order falling on their heads. A|mong&s;t
other Impo&s;itions he thinks ill laid, and
which I will not give my &s;elf the trouble of reci|ting&punc;
he mentions Seal'd Paper, and &s;ays it is a
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ery incertain Revenue, becau&s;e founded on
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aw Suits, to which the folly and ob&s;tinacy of
<PB N="137" REF="73">
humane nature alone gives being; it is true that
in <HI>England,</HI> madder in this particular than <HI>Spain</HI>
or any other part of the World, more profit
might be derived from this, than in a Countrey
where that infamous imployment is not &s;o much
in reque&s;t; whereas in <HI>England</HI> it is exerci&s;ed
with &s;uch avarice, rapine, and &s;o prodigious
delays, that this horrible Pe&s;tilence which feeds
it &s;elf fat by means of infinite numbers of vile In|&s;ects,
Attorneys, Solicitors, Attorneys Lieutenants
and Sub-&s;olicitors, it mu&s;t needs pa&s;s for one of
the heavie&s;t &s;courges of the Nation, and plagues
of its be&s;t Families.</P>
<P>To conclude, he implores his King to ca&s;t off
all tho&s;e ill de&s;igned Impo&s;itions, that will be
de&s;tructive both to him and his Subjects, and to
lay the burthen more equally, which will make
it light, and his people bear it chearfully, when
free from Vexations, that tend more to the
advantage of Pettifoggers, than of his Re|venue.</P>
<P>If what he propo&s;es may be endeavored, he
doubts not but his King will vanqui&s;h all his
Enemies, there being already &s;o many Victo|ries
that te&s;tifie his Valour, and &s;o many Books
that publi&s;h his Prudence, be&s;ides &s;o much Gold
and Silver &s;tamped with his Effigies, currant
thorow the World, though <HI>Spain</HI> admits none
that is Foreign; an invincible demon&s;tration of
its inexhau&s;tible Trea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e two Books were Subjects of our
Di&s;cour&s;e, by rea&s;on of their &s;urprizing Novel|ty,
the Genius of that Nation con&s;idered, which
<PB N="138" REF="74">
&s;eldom di&s;covers where the Shoo wrings it, and
who&s;e con&s;tancy is &s;o admirable, it alwayes &s;ets
a good face on an ill game; we received Letters
for &s;ome of the Principal Mini&s;ters of the Catho|lick
King: had they come to us at our fir&s;t arri|val
at <HI>Madrid,</HI> they would have introduced us
to a nearer &s;peculation of that Court, but arri|ving
in <HI>June,</HI> and we being re&s;olved, for avoid|ing
the great heats, to repa&s;s the <HI>Pyreneans</HI> be|fore
they began, we had but little time to con|tinue
in a Countrey, where the Sun is &s;omething
too prodigal of his beams. To make u&s;e there|fore
of all advantages po&s;&s;ible, and that accord|ing
to Formalities, which are here e&s;&s;ential, I
addre&s;&s;ed my &s;elf to Don <HI>Martin</HI> Secretary of
the Earl of <HI>Pigneranda,</HI> de&s;iring him to give his
Lord the Letter of Recommendation we had for
him. I acquainted him with the qualities of
my Lord <HI>B.</HI> and <HI>A.</HI> and inquired at what hour
we might have acce&s;s, lea&s;t we &s;hould apply our
&s;elves to him when he gave not Audience. Such
precautions are nece&s;&s;arily to be ob&s;erved in this
Court, by all Strangers, who without any to
introduce them, de&s;ire to be particularly admitted
to a Principal Mini&s;ter of State: by means of which
they e&s;cape being expo&s;ed to that dry gravity
which receives Strangers with a leaden au&s;tere
Fore head, clo&s;e and re&s;erved, all &s;uch whom they
apprehend they may mi&s;take in its Civilities, for
want of knowledge of their quality; be&s;ides that,
generally &s;peaking, &s;uch as under&s;tand the World,
ought never them&s;elves to deliver &s;uch Letters,
which &s;erve only to make them known to tho&s;e
<PB N="139" REF="74">
they never &s;aw before; for if they be read in their
pre&s;ence, they &s;uffer &s;ome time of vexatious incivi|lity,
and if the reading them be deferred till after
their departure; at the fir&s;t Vi&s;it they have but a
cold Reception, the Complements faint and con|fu&s;ed,
directed more to him that &s;ent the Letter,
then to tho&s;e that bring it, and for who&s;e &s;ake it
was written. This we avoided, for the Earl ha|ving
been informed, as well by the Letter of Dom
<HI>E&s;tevan de Gamarra,</HI> as report of his Secretary,
who we were, received us as well as we could
wi&s;h: And to &s;peak truth of him, none in this
Court under&s;tands Civility and the World bet|ter.
His fir&s;t pre&s;enting him&s;elf is graceful and
winning, and makes appear, that with the &s;eve|rity
of his Countries Cu&s;toms and imperious gra|vity
of his Nation, he hath mixed a certain fo|rain
air, that takes off from the au&s;terity, and
makes him &s;o agreeable, that if the Addre&s;s
and Gallantry of the fir&s;t of the <HI>Tarquins</HI> cau|&s;ed
it to be &s;aid, <HI>Graecum ingenium mi&s;cuerat I|talicis
artibus,</HI> he had added the Complacency
of <HI>Greece</HI> to the Arts of <HI>Italy.</HI> We may con|clude
that tho&s;e of this great man make evident,
<HI>Hi&s;panicum &s;upercilium pote&s;t moribus exteris &amp;
comitate exotica dilui.</HI> That Spani&s;h &s;everity
may be moderated by forain Civility. His Wit
and Judgement appeared in his Emba&s;&s;y as
Plenipotentiary to <HI>Mun&s;ter;</HI> and when News
came to <HI>Madrid</HI> of the promotion of Cardi|nal
<HI>Chigi</HI> to the Pontifical Chair, and the
great de&s;ire he expre&s;&s;ed for Peace between
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> this man was &s;poken of
<PB N="140" REF="75">
to be &s;ent to <HI>Rome</HI> with the Emba&s;&s;y of
Obedience: though indeed he was chiefly
de&s;igned to that Employment, becau&s;e it was
hoped that by rea&s;on of the great friend&s;hip
he had contracted with the new Pope when
he was <HI>Nuncio</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> he might do his
Ma&s;ter good &s;ervice in all manner of Negotia|tions.
Many advantages are al&s;o reported to
have been offered on behalf of the King to ob|lige
him to accept this, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable
&s;um of ready money, particularly Three thou|&s;and
Ducats a Moneth, his Son to be made an
Earl, and him&s;elf continued Pre&s;ident of the
Council of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and that the Golden Key
he carried only as a Badge of Honour, &s;hould
be conferred <HI>&agrave; Exercicio,</HI> that is to be made u&s;e
of, with all Priviledges belonging to it: but no|thing
of this is yet effected, and they which un|der&s;tand
the confidence of Don <HI>Lewis de Haro</HI>
in his fidelity and capacity, a&s;&s;ure he will not re|move
him from the Council where he is now
Pre&s;ident, till needs mu&s;t. Having thus recei|ved
all manner of &s;atisfaction in our fir&s;t Vi&s;it,
to &s;o accompli&s;hed a Per&s;on, who omitted no|thing
that might a&s;&s;ure my Lord <HI>B.</HI> of the e&s;teem
he had for his quality and merit, at the very fir&s;t
&s;ight remarkable to him by that vivacity which
is &s;o natural to Extraordinary Per&s;ons, they
need not &s;peak twice to tho&s;e to whom they
would make them&s;elves known: We thought
our &s;elves very forward on our way, to obtain
the like from Don <HI>Lewis de Haro,</HI> when we
&s;hould wait on him: For be&s;ides the Letter we
<PB N="141" REF="75">
had for him, we doubted not but the Earl would
acquaint him with the Vi&s;it we had made him&punc;
and with all that could oblige him to receive us
well. Be&s;ides our Letter for Don <HI>Lewis de Ha|ro,</HI>
we had another for a Gentleman called <HI>A|lonzo
Vercoca,</HI> Co&s;in to Dom <HI>Stephen de Gamar|ra</HI>
the Catholick Kings Amba&s;&s;ador in <HI>Holland,</HI>
who, we were a&s;&s;ured was very well with this Fa|vorite.
We therefore thought be&s;t fir&s;t of all
to vi&s;it Seignior <HI>Alonzo,</HI> that he might deliver
our Letter, and pre&s;ent us when it &s;hould be
&s;ea&s;onable. We were not a little troubled in in|quiring
after his Loding, but at la&s;t learned that
he was u&s;ually re&s;ident in the Countrey, and only
a Son of his who was one of Don <HI>Lewis de Ha|ro</HI>'s
Gentleman lived in <HI>Madrid.</HI> Enquiring
for him at the Palace of this Chief Mini&s;ter&punc; I
was told he had a Chamber in the Town, and
came not thither while&s;t his Ma&s;ter was with
the King at <HI>Buen Retiro;</HI> the Civility of the Of|ficers
of whom I enquired his Lodging, extend|ed
not &s;o far as to &s;end &s;ome body to &s;hew it me,
and he being &s;eldom at home, I was either to
&s;eek him very early in the Morning or late in
the Evening. At la&s;t I found him ju&s;t out of
Bed, no le&s;s troubled how to enquire after us,
becau&s;e he had received a Letter from the Am|ba&s;&s;ador
to his Father, by which he reiterated
his reque&s;t for doing us all manner of good Of|fices
in that Court. Some dayes pa&s;&s;ed, in
which he neither vi&s;ited us nor returned any an|&s;wer.
This made me imagine that eithet he did
not much value the Amba&s;&s;adors Letter, or el&s;e
<PB N="142" REF="76">
had not &s;ufficient acce&s;s to his Ma&s;ter to perform
what was recommended to him.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we thought of leaving <HI>Spain,</HI>
I began to con&s;ider how we might obtain
an authentick pa&s;sport, being &s;ufficiently
informed of the in&s;olence and impudence on
the pa&s;&s;es called <HI>Puertos,</HI> as well by the Farmers
of the Cu&s;toms as &s;uch as are there in guard. On
which account many formalities are nece&s;&s;ary
to be ob&s;erved in the Pa&s;&s;es, that they may be
effectual enough to check the importunity and
knavery of tho&s;e Harpies that lie in expectati|on
of travailers, e&s;pecially &s;trangers, to put all
imaginable affronts upon them.</P>
<P>I made very &s;olicitous enquiry of all circum|&s;pections
nece&s;&s;ary, and the Earl of <HI>Pigneranda</HI>
having told my Lord <HI>B.</HI> that not to leave <HI>Spain</HI>
without carrying along one of its greate&s;t rari|ties,
he &s;hould do well to take &s;ome hor&s;es;
to which purpo&s;e he would provide him all &s;uffi|cient
pa&s;sports; we did not in the lea&s;t di&s;tru&s;t, ob|taining
them as advantagious as we could wi&s;h:
they which have no friends in Court, are obliged
to petition a certain Council, who&s;e Secretary is
called <HI>Carnero:</HI> the petition con&s;idered on, if
the Pa&s;s be granted, the Re&s;ult goes from thence
to the Kings Council, from whence it is return|ed
&s;ometimes confirmed, &s;ometimes annulled,
and often limited or amplified, according to the
petitioners &s;ucce&s;s in his &s;olicitations. In|deed,
though either by favour or bribe,
authentick Pa&s;sports are &s;ometimes obtained,
and that without delay; &s;uch as are unknown
<PB N="143" REF="76">
and unfriended, find this trifle become a trou|ble&s;ome
and tedious negotiation. Ours was not
&s;o, for having drawn up a very exact memo|rial,
and according to the &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e that
under&s;tand the form of a Pa&s;sport, to go out
of <HI>Spain</HI> without lett or mole&s;tations: I carried
it to Don <HI>Martin,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Pigneranda</HI>'s Se|cretary:
he read it, and told me &s;o many par|ticulars
were not nece&s;&s;ary; and that our Pa&s;s|port
being to come immediately from the Kings
Council, there needed no more but to tran&s;late
into Spani&s;h, that we had brought from the
Arch-Duke; the like whereof, which would be
every where re&s;pected, &s;hould be di&s;patched
us; I acquie&s;ced in this, and went with him to
<HI>Geronimo de la Torre,</HI> one of the Secretaries of
State, to whom he delivered a Memorial for
the &s;aid Pa&s;sport, recommending it to him in
the name of his Ma&s;ter; he promi&s;ed to carry
it to the Council of State that very day, u&s;ing
us with great civility, and accompanying us
to the bottom of his &s;tairs.</P>
<P>Our Pa&s;sport being in this forwardne&s;s, Mr.
<HI>B.</HI> and I, went one morning to vi&s;it Segnior
<HI>Ver&s;o&s;a,</HI> by it the better to under&s;tand the nati|ons
humour, and whether negligence or want
of credit had cau&s;ed his failing in what the Am|ba&s;&s;ador
de&s;ired of him: he in&s;tantly excu&s;ed
his not having waited on us, and told us he had
delivered the Letter to Don <HI>Lewis de Haro,</HI> who
had commanded him to accompany us to Au|dience
(&s;uch is the manner of &s;peaking in this
Court) which he would give us the next day.
<PB N="144" REF="77">
This di&s;covered that his &s;lowne&s;s in returning us
an&s;wer, was rather an effect of the humor of
his nation, (not very punctual nor forward in
its civilities, no more then in its affairs) then of
his negligence or little power to perform what
had bin recommended to him; being a kin to
the Secretary <HI>Geronimo de la Torre,</HI> who had re|ceived
our Memorial, he would needs go along
with us to him, and recommend it in our pre|&s;ence;
but I was &s;trangely &s;urprized to &s;ee this
man in this vi&s;it we made in company of his kin&s;|man,
&s;o different from what I had before found
him; for in&s;tead of our former civil reception of
which I &s;poke but now, he would &s;carcely move
from his Table and Papers, entertaining us with
interrupted &s;entences, whil&s;t he ranged the wri|tings
he held in his hand. I was &s;candalized at
&s;uch an inequality, and the favourable&s;t judge|ment
I could make, was (whil&s;t I con&s;idered
him to be of that nation which is e&s;teemed &s;o
unvariable in its humor and actions) that his
thoughts were that day entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by
&s;omething very important and vexatious. This
prevented not our repairing next morning ac|cording
to our appointment to vi&s;it the chief
Mini&s;ter of &s;o &s;uperbe a Court. He is not
difficult of acce&s;s, nor environed with the pomp
and &s;plendor u&s;ually affected by &s;uch as po&s;|&s;e&s;s
the place next their Ma&s;ter: he is not court|ed,
nor his withdrawing room crouded with any
that have not bu&s;ine&s;s with him; none are re|fu&s;ed
admittance, but every man in his turn
brought into his chamber, where having &s;po|ken,
<PB N="145" REF="77">
he retires and gives place to others&punc; To
&s;uch as are not admitted, if they have former|ly
moved him in their concerns; he &s;ignifies his
plea&s;ure by his Secretary, which (if they have
nothing new to offer) mu&s;t of force content
them; &s;uch as have never opened their affair,
or have any thing to add, are referred to the
next day or another hour: &s;o that few go a|way
without &s;ome kind of &s;atisfaction or hopes to
receive it, at lea&s;t, in obtaining Audience. In other
places, Favourites or chief Mini&s;ters &s;eldom are
acce&s;&s;ible, and never till after many refufals; and
not content to participate of the Soveraigns au|thority,
pretend to a degree of adoration above
it: and we may a&s;&s;ure our &s;elves, that though this
quality occa&s;ions in mo&s;t of the&s;e, pride, vanity,
and plea&s;ure; it gives Don <HI>Lewis</HI> (as he makes
u&s;e of it) trouble alone, and that among&s;t all
that are in publick employment he is not only
fir&s;t in rank, but in attachment and &s;ubjection
to the &s;ervice of his King; to which, to &s;peak
the truth, he intirely re&s;igns him&s;elf: for in the
morning immediately after his devotions, and
vi&s;it of the Kings apartment, about Seven a
clock he &s;its down in his chamber of di&s;patch|es,
where he continues till one; giving order to
his Secretaries in all that is to be done, and
hearing &s;uch as are to &s;peak with him, pre|ented
by order as hath already bin &s;aid: after din|&s;ner
he repo&s;es, or retires &s;ome hours; and about
four or five, returns to the &s;ame chamber, and
like imployment till &s;even. Two days in the
week he, as well as the King, gives publick Au|dience;
<PB N="146" REF="78">
then all enter, and I have &s;een there of
all qualities, even lame and naked &s;oldiers, who
among&s;t others pre&s;ent them&s;elves and preten|ces,
without any other difference, then obliging
them to advance with di&s;cretion and re&s;pect, if
perhaps they ob&s;erve it not.</P>
<P>To all this is to be added, his care of the
Court, he being Ma&s;ter of the Hor&s;e, with his
hours at both Councils of State and Privy, be|&s;ides
Audiences of ceremony, and affairs of Am|ba&s;&s;adors,
and Agents of forreign Princes; &s;o
that I can imagine no life more agitated nor
bu&s;ied then his. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of his parts,
which the Spaniards hold not equal to tho&s;e of
his predece&s;&s;or; the other having bin quick and
active in the mo&s;t eminent degree; but they
add that they were not therefore more &s;ucce&s;|ful,
either in publick or particular; and that
the great moderation and good nature of this
man, is equivalent to the heat and zeal of the
former, who to attain his ends, &s;uffered none to
enjoy quiet: &s;o true is that of the Politians,
that the greate&s;t intellects are not mo&s;t proper
to govern States and Kingdoms; and that they
look &s;o far before them, they often &s;tumble in
&s;uch a manner as ca&s;ts them into extremities,
from whence all their dexterity hath much ado
to free them, and the height of their good for|tune
to &s;ecure them from ruine; whereas the
middle &s;ort by moving &s;oftly are not &s;ubject to
tho&s;e politick tran&s;ports, which often to&s;s intere&s;t
of State into the air with the &s;ublime&s;t maximes
of him that governs.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="78">
As &s;oon as we came to <HI>Don Lewis</HI> his lodging,
which was then at the Hermitage of <HI>Buen retiro,</HI>
we were received by Don <HI>Chri&s;topher</HI> his Secre|tary.
He is a little man, of addre&s;s and &s;ubtilty
beyond what is u&s;ual in his nation, being a Ger|man,
of which Countrey he hath &s;o little the
meen and pre&s;ence, one would rather take him
to have been born at the foot of the <HI>Apennine</HI>
or <HI>Pyreneans,</HI> then on the banks of <HI>Rhine</HI> or
<HI>Danube.</HI> He takes care of all forreign affairs,
and &s;erves his ma&s;ter as interpreter; we were
immediately pre&s;ented to him, and thus he re|ceived
us: He &s;ate in a Chair at the end of a Ta|ble,
with his Cloak on his &s;houlders, and his
&s;word by his &s;ide; he ro&s;e up at our entrance,
and after we had &s;aluted him, cau&s;ed &s;eats to be
pre&s;ented us; and immediately <HI>Don Chri&s;topher</HI>
placed him&s;elf on his knees, on the Carpet that
was between his Chair, and that of my Lord <HI>B.</HI>
who having &s;poken, Don <HI>Lewis</HI> an&s;wered by in|terpretation
of Don <HI>Chri&s;topher,</HI> as obligingly as
was po&s;&s;ible. After the fir&s;t compliments, he en|quired
after our journey, and continuance at
<HI>Madrid,</HI> and finding us inclined to leave it, ask|ed,
if we would not pa&s;s by <HI>Sevil;</HI> and we ex|cu&s;ing
our &s;elves, by rea&s;on the Summer was &s;o
far advanced; he replyed, our time indeed
pre&s;&s;ed us, if we de&s;ired to be out of <HI>Spain</HI> be|fore
the great heats; but not vi&s;iting <HI>Andalu&s;ia,</HI>
we lo&s;t the &s;ight of the plea&s;ante&s;t Countrey in
the world; he afterwards made us many offers
of &s;ervice, and when we acquainted him that
we de&s;ired to pa&s;s through <HI>Arragon,</HI> and, if po&s;|&s;ible,
<PB N="148" REF="79">
enter <HI>France</HI> by <HI>Catalonia;</HI> he promi&s;ed
us two Letters of recommendation; one to the
Duke of <HI>Monteleon,</HI> Viceroy of <HI>Arragon,</HI> the
other for Don <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Au&s;tria.</HI> He asked us if
we would ki&s;s the Kings hands; but our time
for leaving the Countrey being &s;o near, we
thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to give him the trouble
of obtaining that honour for us, having &s;o of|ten
&s;een his Maje&s;ty. In a word, he omitted no|thing
that was obliging, or might render our
vi&s;it &s;atisfactory; he is indeed of a humour to
di&s;content no body, and never favorite did le&s;s
hurt: he &s;uffers to live at Court, not only &s;uch
as envy him, but his profe&s;&s;ed enemies, as the
Duke <HI>de Medina de los Torres,</HI> and goes abroad
with &s;o &s;mall pomp, that his Train little or no|thing
exceeds the meane&s;t Grand of <HI>Spain:</HI>
he is not crouded after, but ob&s;erved to follow
much better then his predece&s;&s;or, the advice of
a favourite of the &s;ame nation, who after his fall
admoni&s;hed all of the like condition, them&s;elves
to put a &s;poke in the wheel of fortune, when by
too great an elevation &s;he almo&s;t equalized them
to the King, adding, that he which thinks him|&s;elf
advanced highe&s;t, is often neare&s;t his ruine,
and therefore ought never to be tran&s;ported to
receive &s;uch honours and attendances, as his
fall cannot deprive him of, without &s;hame; on
occa&s;ion of which I mu&s;t needs mention, what
was reported to me to have been &s;poken by a
great State&s;man of this Court: <HI>That a Favo|rite
ought to have the moderation and prudence of
that Angel before whom St</HI> John <HI>pro&s;trated him|&s;elf
<PB N="149" REF="79">
with adoration,</HI> and refu&s;e &s;ome kind of re|&s;pects
that may be rendred him with a <HI>Vide ne
feceris, con&s;ervus tuus &s;um:</HI> for if God in that
immen&s;ity of glory and power he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es to
reduce the univer&s;e to nothing, admits no com|panion
in his adorations: Kings who&s;e Autho|rity
is limited, and who&s;e Might only weakly
imitates that which is infinite, will much le&s;s
endure it. Such boundle&s;s ambition, and exce&s;|&s;ive
thir&s;t of grandeur, in two years time &s;trange|ly
&s;hook Cardinal <HI>Spinola,</HI> one of the greate&s;t
Favorites of <HI>Philip</HI> the II. and at la&s;t overthrew
that famous Conde Duke <HI>Olivares,</HI> who&s;e place
is at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Don <HI>Lewis.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides what I have touched concerning his
Mini&s;try, the curious find a con&s;iderable diffe|rence
between the favors of the Uncle and Ne|phew,
as well in the foundation as manage|ments
of them; they con&s;ider that of the for|mer
was derived from his conformity of man|ners
(real or affected) with tho&s;e of his King;
and from the care he took to &s;econd his incli|nations,
and make him&s;elf a nece&s;&s;ary in|&s;trument
of his &s;atisfaction in plea&s;ures, perhaps
contrary to his greatne&s;s and condition: but that
of the &s;econd had its &s;ource from the Kings ob|ligations
to him, for &s;ervices rendred him in en|counters
where his Life and Crown were con|cerned:

<HI>Luines</HI> ro&s;e near <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIII of <HI>France,</HI>
and the later by a way very like that a&s;cended
by Cardinal <HI>Richlieu:</HI> the Nephew had time to
make u&s;e of the faults and misfortunes of the
Uncle, as well as the Cardinal of the failings of
his Predece&s;&s;or. But for what concerns the ex|erci&s;e
of his authority, they ob&s;erve it is very
different from the other three. The Duke <HI>de
Luines,</HI> and the Conde Duke <HI>Olivares</HI> di&s;turbed
the quiet of their Ma&s;ters Dominions; the fir&s;t,
that he might make u&s;e of the &s;word of Con|&s;table
he had newly received, and the other to
make o&s;tentation of the va&s;t capacity he pre|tended
to above all mankind. <HI>Richlieu,</HI> who
&s;ucceeded the fir&s;t of the&s;e, though with very
different maximes, thought neverthele&s;s he was
to continue the war he found begun, to gain
him reputation, and remove all ob&s;tacles that
might prevent &s;uch a one as was more the in|tere&s;t
of <HI>France,</HI> and would give him oppor|tunity
of entring the Li&s;ts with that ambitious
Conde Duke. Don <HI>Lewis</HI> was no &s;ooner infa|vour,
and entred on bu&s;ine&s;s, but he endeavour|ed
to make under&s;tood, that the whole world
and e&s;pecially the hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> &s;uffered by
emulation of tho&s;e two Mini&s;ters. He well fore|&s;aw

<PB N="151" REF="80">
It is &s;aid, he effectually repre&s;ent|ed
to the King and his Council the faults of his
predece&s;&s;or, and made it appear, that the uni|ver&s;al
de&s;ire of all the le&s;&s;er Potentates of
<HI>Europe,</HI> who wi&s;h equality among&s;t the great|e&s;t,
as ballances where every one may find his
counterpoi&s;e is very &s;uitable both to the inclina|tions
and intere&s;ts of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain&punc;</HI> though
not often &s;o to the ambition of their Kings,
and vanity of the Mini&s;ters that &s;erve them;
and that which &s;oever of them gains upon the
other, would acquire mo&s;t enemies, were not
<HI>Europe</HI> by artifice of their Favorites (who &s;et
their Ma&s;ters together by the ears to make o&s;ten|tation
of their own addre&s;s during the combat,
as Pilots their skill in the height of a tempe&s;t)
divided into Leagues, and almo&s;t all of it in
arms in favor of one or other of the&s;e Crowns&punc;
that whil&s;t war continued, the allies of <HI>France</HI>
would never for&s;ake her to become Neuters,
or turn their &s;words again&s;t her, but that in the
mean time the dangers into which they preci|pitated
them&s;elves, were to be repre&s;ented to
them, with a great inclination to peace, even
&s;o far, as to purcha&s;e it at what price &s;oever.
That experience in all ages had made evident,
they recovered by Treaties what they had lo&s;t
that by wars. That in <HI>Germany</HI> even they were to
be incited to cry up peace that were confederates
with <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> to oblige them to which,
they &s;hould have intimation, that nothing was
taken into greater con&s;ideration, then their &s;a|tisfaction;
and that it was high time to divert
<PB N="152" REF="81">
the jealou&s;ie of their liberty again&s;t two forraign
Potenthtes, more ready to invade it, then ever
the Emperor was to impo&s;e fetters upon it. That
in <HI>Italy, Flanders,</HI> and all other parts where
there were Leagues again&s;t <HI>France,</HI> the like was
to be done; and at the general Treaty of peace,
all de&s;irable conditions given to their weake&s;t
enemies, to enfeeble the more potent by depri|ving
them of the others a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Thus the
beginning of his Mini&s;try, (if what hath been
informed me, and I have here repre&s;ented be
true) was not to cry up war in his Ma&s;ters ears,
out of con&s;ideration only, of what might augment
his own power, as is done by &s;uch Epicures of
favor as turn it to their particular advantage:
He would neither &s;eem idolatrous in his poli|ticks,
by giving no council but &s;uch as was to
his Ma&s;ters advantage; nor Athei&s;tical in valuing
nothing but the good of the people, but with
re&s;pect to both of them, &s;hewed him&s;elf a good
State&s;man&punc; dealing with them like Husband and
Wife, and concluding that for their living hap|pily
together, they &s;hould admit no friend that
might &s;eparate their intere&s;ts. I had bin made
acquainted with &s;ome of the&s;e particulars be|fore
I vi&s;ited Don <HI>Lewis,</HI> and could &s;et down
more, were not a great part of the remarques
as well effaced from my Tablebook, as vani&s;h|ed
from my memory: if it be expected, I &s;ay
&s;omething of his per&s;on; I mu&s;t add, it is &s;uffici|ently
taking, and that I was told, his wit was
neither of the fine&s;t or gro&s;&s;e&s;t temper, not ex|travagantly
high, nor in&s;ipidly low; his coun|tenance
<PB N="153" REF="81">

ways incommodious, either to Prince or Peo|ple;
and as he charms not the fir&s;t by extraor|dinary
endowments either of mind or body;
neither does he di&s;gu&s;t the later. And a Spani|ard
one day told me, <HI>En el &s;emblante mi&s;mo e&s;te

<P>The great revolutions in the affairs of this
Monarchy &s;ince Don <HI>Lewis</HI> had the managing
of them, pre&s;ent me a va&s;t field to expatiate on
what &s;eems vigorous or weak in his conduct;
for &s;ome particulars are ob&s;ervable, in which,
nothing more could be wi&s;hed then what he
did, and others as di&s;cernable, in which he
&s;eems not to have made u&s;e of all advantages
that pre&s;ented them&s;elves. The peace conclu|ded
at <HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> with the Hollanders, is thought
a ma&s;terpiece, they having received as an eter|nal
maxime, never to have it with his King;
and the miracle became greater, not only in
that he di&s;armed them by a particular Treaty,
under no other garranty, but that Seal and Oath
they had &s;o many years prote&s;ted never to con|fide
in; but made u&s;e of the family of <HI>Orange,</HI>
<PB N="154" REF="82">

&s;etting a knife at the throat of its own
glory and reputation.</P>
<P>After &s;o politick an atchievement, he might
have effected another little le&s;s con&s;iderable, if
we may credit &s;uch as determine the affairs of
Princes, according to their particular capacities,
had he (during the troubles of <HI>France)</HI> endea|voured
a peace with that Crown, which in &s;uch
an extremity mu&s;t needs have accepted it, on
conditions, more advantagious to <HI>Spain,</HI> then
the Towns retaken by it, becau&s;e giving way to
her inte&s;tine commotions, by removing the for|raign
object that might divert her di&s;&s;entions
and civil enmities, her fury would have rebound|ed
on her own bo&s;om, and &s;he like a good Mo|ther
have abandoned the greate&s;t part of her
conque&s;ts, to gain more lei&s;ure and better op|portunity
to cha&s;ti&s;e her di&s;obedient children:
here it is that con&s;idering affairs by their event,
and &s;eeing <HI>France</HI> again in as good a way as
ever to pur&s;ue her victories, the Spani&s;h Coun|cils
are blamed for neglecting that opportunity
of putting &s;uch a &s;top to them, as &s;hould have
prevented their progre&s;&s;ion. In&s;tead therefore
of Treaties with the City of <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;iders with
the Princes, and the Princes them&s;elves, it is
&s;aid, <HI>Spain</HI> ought to have negotiated with the
Court alone, from which, as is believed, it might
have had good terms for abandoning the &s;edi|tious,
and their endeavors to encourage the re|bellion,
<PB N="155" REF="82">
in which interim, the Catholick King
might probably have &s;ucceeded beyond the Py|reneans,
in reducing the Catalonians, and re|covering
<HI>Portugal,</HI> much more con&s;iderable to
him, becau&s;e very certain, that the revolt of the
former, and &s;eparation of the later, are the
greate&s;t mi&s;chiefs, that have attacqued that
Monarchy during the whole war; for remedy
of which, it &s;hould have neglected &s;ome &s;light
brui&s;es in other places, and applyed it &s;elf only
to the cure of tho&s;e two wounds &s;o near its heart.
The ways of doing this, had bin more ea&s;ie, more
&s;afe, and of le&s;s expence then tho&s;e which re|covered
<HI>Barcelone;</HI> they which examined the af|fairs
of that time, were of opinion that the Spa|niards
lo&s;t more by retaking that Town, and
neglecting to relieve <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> then they
would have done by &s;ome condi&s;centions to
<HI>France</HI> in order to peace. For it was freely di&s;|cour&s;ed
in that Court, that the &s;iege of <HI>Barcel|lone</HI>
co&s;t &s;o dear both in men and money, that
&s;o great a failing of &s;pirits followed, that all the
repo&s;e obtained by the French di&s;orders, was
not &s;ufficient to their re&s;toration, and that neg|lecting
to relieve <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> gave the French
opportunity of freeing them&s;elves from the dif|ficulties
of appea&s;ing their civil war, and almo&s;t
at the &s;ame time of re-beginning an offen&s;ive
one again&s;t the forraigners with vigor equal
to their former. In the judgement therefore of
the&s;e criticks, the Spaniards could neither make
all the progre&s;&s;ions, might have been expect|ed
from them in &s;uch a conjuncture, notwith|&s;tanding
<PB N="156" REF="83">
their recovering three or four of the
principal places they had lo&s;t, nor embrace the
opportunity of the peace, to which <HI>France</HI> &s;eem|ed
nece&s;&s;itated, nor yet &s;upply the flames of ci|vil
di&s;cord already &s;o well kindled, but after &s;o
great charge and &s;mall profit, they looked on
them as negligent Merchants that had let &s;lip
the be&s;t time of the Fair, and perhaps brought
but one commodity from it, that will never &s;ell
for what was laid down in ready Money, and is
hereafter to be paid for it: I mean the Prince
of <HI>Conde</HI> and re&s;t of the French that are at pre|&s;ent
only a charge to them, and whom decea&s;ed
<HI>Quevedo,</HI> were he now alive, would joyn to the
late Queen Mother of <HI>France</HI> and Duke of&mdash;
for that new kind of &s;tratagem by which the
King of <HI>France</HI> may batter by di&s;gu&s;ting all his
family, who repairing in di&s;content to the Spani|ard,
will oblige him in a&s;&s;i&s;ting them to con&s;ume
that which is de&s;igned to maintain his Armies.
Now the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> is retired to them, and
hath no more places nor Troops in <HI>France,</HI>

the miracles he did at the rout before <HI>Ar|ras,</HI>
and on occa&s;ion of which it is reported,
the King writ to him in the&s;e terms. <HI>Mi primo,

in entertaining him, and &s;uch as have followed
him, the profit of tho&s;e great pen&s;ions accrues
<PB N="157" REF="83">

e&s;tate, by means of which &s;he may well &s;upport
the lo&s;s of &s;ome Regiments to the weakening
her own and &s;trengthening her enemies Army.
Their e&s;teem for his per&s;on is indeed equal to his
merit, and his name is in &s;uch veneration both
among&s;t Nobility and People, that he is looked
on as the greate&s;t Captain that Europe hath
&s;een in many ages, and to be above all encomi|ums
due to the highe&s;t courages; his actions
&s;urpa&s;&s;ing all that can be imagined; notwith|&s;tanding
which they con&s;ider him to be a &s;tran|ger,
and Prince of the blood of a Crown that is
enemy, which makes the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an
entire confidence between him and <HI>Spain,</HI> very
difficult, but to prevent all appearance of &s;uch
di&s;tru&s;ts, which they have much ado to di&s;gui&s;e,
they have made u&s;e of an artifice, that hath been
well enough di&s;covered by his Agents; which is,
that &s;uch of them as cannot be concealed, are im|puted

<HI>Fuen&s;aldaigne,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the intrigue of <HI>Flan|ders,</HI>

that rather amu&s;e then &s;atisfy him; to take a|way
which the Prince hath declared again&s;t
<HI>Fuen&s;aldaigne,</HI> and cau&s;ed his calling home to
be &s;ollicited in Court, with prote&s;tation, that as
long as he continues in the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> with
the pre&s;ent power, he will not only ruine
his affairs, but the Kings his Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Mazecolles</HI> his Agent told me,
he had made them &s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible of all the

<PB N="158" REF="84">
the kindne&s;s <HI>Don Lewis</HI> hath for him, prevails
again&s;t any remedy. That the Arch-duke had
given the &s;ame advice, all which could not pre|vent
their ob&s;tinacy in continuing him, ground|ed
perhaps on this Maxim, which requires (as
well in Kingdoms as Families) to nouri&s;h di&s;&s;en|tion
among&s;t tho&s;e which &s;erve, le&s;t they con|&s;pire
to betray us, or are not exact enough in
ob&s;erving the comportments of one another,
nothing being &s;o indu&s;trious or penetrating, as
envy and animo&s;ity, which prie not only into
what the Ma&s;ter would not be ignorant of, but
into &s;uch things of which he cares not for get|ting
information.</P>
<P>In the mean time let politick Cen&s;ors, who

the inductive rea&s;ons of which they are igno|rant,

to their fancies of this great intrigue of State, the
effect of the <HI>French</HI> troubles: they &s;hall not yet

&s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;es cau&s;ed by them, as well in <HI>Ger|many,</HI>
where a King of <HI>Romans</HI> was cho&s;en, as

flames to be too &s;oon extingui&s;hed; &s;o that they
<PB N="159" REF="84">
cannot without indignation mention the negli|gence
of the Marquis of <HI>St. Cruz,</HI> when he en|deavoured
with the Fleet under his command,
that had been fitted up at <HI>St. Seba&s;tians,</HI> to open
the pa&s;&s;age of the River to the be&s;ieged. He was
encharged with this employment, becau&s;e not
having comported him&s;elf &s;atisfactorily in one
like it, it was believed he would &s;trive to make
amends by &s;ome very eminent action in &s;o pre&s;|&s;ing
a nece&s;&s;ity: but he failed even at his fir&s;t
&s;etting out; for having received his orders at
<HI>Madrid,</HI> where the Earl of <HI>Fie&s;que</HI> arrived to
ha&s;ten him, he went away in a Litter, with all
the conveniencies of one that had time enough
before him, and as if he had not had a Com|mi&s;&s;ion
that required the mo&s;t extraordinary
diligence. His delays were the &s;ame in embar|king,
and having &s;hewn him&s;elf at &s;ea&punc; and
&s;carcely taken view of the Enemy, he retreated
to <HI>la Corugna</HI> in <HI>Gallicia,</HI> where among&s;t the
delightful Limon and Orange-trees, that grow
there abundantly, he let the bad weather pa&s;s
over, and with it the opportunity of &s;ecuring
<HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> who&s;e lo&s;s was the intire ruine of
the di&s;affected party in <HI>Ga&s;conie,</HI> and of the
Treaty of the Prince of <HI>Conti.</HI> His manner of
proceeding a&s;toni&s;hed all that were concerned,
though &s;ome &s;u&s;pected his orders required no
more but to make a &s;hew of relieving the place;
whether it were that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> would hazard
nothing in a War that could not la&s;t long in that
part, or whether there were an under&s;tanding
(according to the ravings of &s;uch as on all occa|&s;ions
<PB N="160" REF="85">
vent their imaginations) by the return of
<HI>Bourdeaux</HI> to its Kings obedience, to obtain the
like for <HI>Barcelona.</HI> Whatever may be of this,
he was &s;ecured and confined to a Ca&s;tle where
he &s;till remains, as is thought, more on accompt
of rea&s;on of State then of his guilt.</P>
<P>To conclude, the French troubles pre&s;ented
great &s;peculations to the chief Mini&s;ter and o|ther
Wits here, how far they ought to concern
them&s;elves in them: but tho&s;e of <HI>Naples</HI> which
happened a little before, and which the King of
<HI>Spain</HI> beheld as a fire kindled in a corner of his
Dominion, he mo&s;t valued, and di&s;tru&s;ted were
no le&s;s &s;ubjects of the di&s;cour&s;e of &s;uch as had
curio&s;ity for the affairs of either Crown. All a|gree
that <HI>France</HI> drew not &s;o great advantages
from them as &s;he might have done, had &s;he
more &s;treightly embraced the <HI>Neopolitan</HI> inte|re&s;ts,
and &s;uch as have di&s;cour&s;ed with me about
it, have made it evident, that <HI>Spain</HI> in no occa|&s;ion
ever judged more &s;olidly, or acted more
effectually. At the fir&s;t advice of that revolu|tion
&s;he was not deceived in taking her mea|&s;ures,
and the Earl of <HI>Ognate</HI> giving his &s;en&s;e
of it, made the mi&s;chief and its remedy &s;o in|telligible,
that he was employed to admini|&s;ter
the later. I &s;aw an Extract of his Letter,
which repre&s;ented that the fury of that people
could not la&s;t, having at fir&s;t declared open war
again&s;t the Nobility and all that were powerful.
That &s;uch commotions (the better part of the
State being contrary to them) bring forth on|ly
confu&s;ion and di&s;order, without any po&s;&s;ibi|lity
<PB N="161" REF="85">
of erecting a true form of Government,
which mu&s;t be done (if at all) in a moment, and
that a multitude that had neither feet nor wings
proportionable to mounting &s;o high mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily
fall of it &s;elf, being imprudent in its
Councils, ra&s;h in its De&s;ignes, and &s;low and time|rous
in its Executions. That the people of <HI>Na|ples</HI>
went very aukwardly about forming them-them&s;elves
into a Republick, beginning by de&s;o|lation
of the riche&s;t Families, which could not
be &s;o totally ruined, but they would retain pow|er
to joyn with the offended Prince in the pub|lick
revenge; and that that which would be im|po&s;ed
on this enraged Multitude would be the
more advantageous, in that it would give oppor|tunity
of drawing the reins of Government
&s;treighter, and binding them &s;o fa&s;t, that not|with&s;tanding
their former &s;everal bloodlettings,
a vein &s;hould then be opened, by which &s;hould
be drawn the greate&s;t part even of that which was
be&s;t, provided all that was corrupted came a|way
with it. His council was followed, and his
hand employed in the Execution, while&s;t he
doubtle&s;ly played the part of an able Surgeon,
the whole body of the Rebels &s;uffering his lan|cet,
and the Ringleaders his Saw and Ra&s;or. All
the world is witne&s;s of his admirable conduct in
&s;o dangerous a Malady. I &s;hall only add that
he is looked on here as the able&s;t and zealou&s;e&s;t
Polititian of <HI>Spain;</HI> and it is not doubted but if
he had employment &s;uitable to his wi&s;hes, he
would add &s;omething of vigor that in &s;everal

of <HI>Dom Lewis,</HI> was one from the North,
who&s;e intere&s;t was at fir&s;t well enough under|&s;tood:
for none admired that <HI>Spain</HI> kept an Am|ba&s;&s;ador
at <HI>Stockholm</HI> for facilitating the Electi|on
of the Son of the Emperor to be King of <HI>Ro|mans.</HI>
The <HI>Swedes</HI> were judged to have great
credit in the Empire, and known to have too
long oppo&s;ed the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> to look well
on its elevations; a man of parts might &s;ound
their intentions, di&s;cover their de&s;ignes, and by
dexterity allay their greate&s;t animo&s;ity again&s;t
the Emperor, if not obtain &s;omething really fa|vourable
in his behalf. <HI>Piementelli,</HI> cho&s;en for
this imployment, had &s;ucce&s;s beyond what was
expected, quickly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him&s;elf of the good
opinion of that Queen, ever charmed by novel|ty;
for among&s;t the great affluence of &s;tran|gers
&s;he drew to her Court, the la&s;t comer &s;till
carried it from all the re&s;t. She was &s;o much plea|&s;ed
in a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> having never yet received any
re&s;pects from that Nation, that it was not diffi|cult
for him to make him&s;elf acceptable without
taking pains to corrupt any of her Council.
Such as under&s;tood how matters pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Swede</HI>
<PB N="163" REF="86">
were not &s;upri&s;ed at her letters during the Diet
of <HI>Ratisbone,</HI> as well to the Emperor, as to the
Electors and other Princes about election of a
King of <HI>Romans.</HI> They ea&s;ily perceived that the
Coun&s;ellors of the Kingdom and able&s;t heads
had not contributed to &s;o open and authentick a
Declaration in favour of the King of <HI>Hungary.</HI>
During her Fathers reign, and in her minority,
they had been otherwi&s;e in&s;pired; and if their
opinions might have prevailed, doubtle&s;ly the
Party of the Princes and Towns had rather been
&s;upported, who demanded a making good of
all that had been agreed on by the Peace of
<HI>Mun&s;ter</HI> before they would proceed to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">t Ele|ction.
This makes ea&s;ily comprehended that
an Amba&s;&s;ador from this Court was nece&s;&s;ary
during all that time, but that he &s;hould be con|tinued
after the re&s;ignation of this Prince&s;s, and
that when &s;he had left the Kingdom <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">iemente<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI>
&s;hould every where follow her under that chara|cter,
is a my&s;tery, of which no rea&s;on can be ima|gined,
that &s;eems not too flat and feeble to be
real. For why &s;hould the <HI>Spaniards</HI> be at &s;uch
co&s;t to keep in with this Prince&s;s after &s;he had
di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her &s;elf of her Dominion, or court
her then, their enemies having received all her
favours whil&s;t &s;he &s;ate on the throne? The <HI>Spa|niards,</HI>
I &s;ay, that never do any thing, where that
intere&s;t, that as much governs Kings as Kings do
Subjects, is not exactly ob&s;erved: that repine
at the entertaining the many di&s;contented Prin|ces
that have &s;ided with them, and that &s;eldom
abandon what is &s;olid and nece&s;&s;ary, for what is
<PB N="164" REF="87">
plau&s;ible and &s;uperfluous. Notwith&s;tanding all
which they not only cau&s;ed her to be attended
by an Amba&s;&s;ador, when &s;he had no right to one,
and who (her Prerogative being gone with her
Soveraignty) mu&s;t needs appear rather a
Gentleman U&s;her than Publick Mini&s;ter, but
omitted not to complement and pre&s;ent her
from <HI>Madrid</HI> it &s;elf, with 12 of the beautifulle&s;t
Hor&s;es of the Kings Stable. What is rumored
here that &s;he hath &s;till the di&s;po&s;al of Forces,
and that <HI>Koning&s;marc</HI> by her Order marches to
a&s;&s;i&s;t the Arch-Duke with an Army of Twelve
thou&s;and men, is a meer raillery.</P>
<P>Her re&s;ignation was doubtle&s;s a &s;ecret of
State, &s;pun and wove with more art than is ima|gined,
and nothing le&s;s than what it &s;eemed;
&s;he retained neither credit nor authority to make
her Mi&s;tre&s;s of any thing more than her Pen&s;i|ons;
and though becau&s;e the Pill was very well
gilt, the World believed &s;he &s;wallowed it wil|lingly,
and ta&s;ted nothing bitter, a Per&s;on of
as great judgment as curio&s;ity, told me, That as
the <HI>Palatine</HI> appeared a great Captain when <HI>Ge|nerali&s;&s;imo</HI>
in <HI>Germany,</HI> he no le&s;s approved him|&s;elf
an able Polititian, in a quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf
of the Crown of the Great <HI>Gu&s;tavus</HI> his
Uncle, even in the life-time of his Daughter
and only Heir: The manner of doing this &s;eems
very &s;ubtle, for after he was declared her Suc|ce&s;&s;or
(partly on occa&s;ion of the over-heroick
inclinations of that Prince&s;s, who &s;eemed amo|rous
only of her own wit, and more ambitious
to be thought a Woman learned and liberal,
<PB N="165" REF="87">
than a Queen prudent and capable of governing
partly by rea&s;on of the inclination of the Coun|&s;ellors
and States of the Kingdom, who grew
weary of obeying a Maid, more &s;ollicitous to be
the Miracle of her Sex than of her Dignity)
and a re&s;olution taken that if &s;he &s;hould marry,
it mu&s;t be with none but him, all his endeavors
tended to make known he was fitter to e&s;pou&s;e
the Kingdom than Queen: in effect he quickly
appeared equal to the former, and (were it na|turally
or artificially) &s;o well acted the part of a
King, that it was very apparent that while&s;t he
fell back from probability of being &s;uch by
means of the later, he advanced in hopes of it,
by the general inclination of the People, and
Intere&s;t of State. His Conformity of Humors
and Manners with tho&s;e of that Coun|trey,
opened him &s;o fair a way to the Throne,
that the Queen (who&s;e Cu&s;toms were directly
contrary) became jealous, with &s;uch an aver&s;i|on
for his Per&s;on, as &s;he could not &s;ufficiently
conceal. This obliged him to retire to an I&s;land,
part of his Inheritance, leaving all to time and
the Queen her &s;elf, who confirmed the People
in their di&s;like of her. She continued to value
le&s;s than &s;he ought the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Per|&s;ons,
and mo&s;t important Affairs. Her va&s;t fan|cy
and ardent thir&s;t after curious Sciences, joyn|ed
to that extraordinary manner of conduct that
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her, made her flie from thought to
thought, and from employment to employment,
without ever fixing on the Duties of her Charge,
and Care of her Crown and Subjects. One while
<PB N="166" REF="88">
&s;he was entirely taken up by Letters with <HI>Des
Cartes, Salma&s;ius,</HI> and <HI>Bouchard,</HI> whom &s;he
had &s;ent for, with the fir&s;t to engage her &s;elf
in the Labirinth of his Modern Philo&s;ophy,
with the other to trace the Antiquities of <HI>Rome</HI>
and <HI>Greece,</HI> and with the la&s;t to penetrate the
My&s;teries of the Catholick and Prote&s;tant Faith.
Sometimes &s;he abandoned both Books and Scho|lars,
calling all the fir&s;t Bawbles, and the la&s;t
Pedants. At the time of this gay humor, crowds
of young people that &s;warmed about her, p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed
their time very agreeably. Masks, Balls, Plays,
Collations, Huntings, Tours, with all the lit|tle
plea&s;ures that are the principal ragouts of the
idlene&s;s of Courts, were then alone in reque&s;t.
Wit and Fancy, with all that boundle&s;s and ex|travagant
jollity can produce, then di&s;played
them&s;elves with the highe&s;t advantages, and
his parts were mo&s;t applauded, that &s;eemed ca|pable&s;t
of the&s;e fond Diver&s;ions which lead from
plea&s;ure to plea&s;ure and pa&s;time to pa&s;time,
without knowing what they &s;eek, or on what
to &s;ettle. In the&s;e &s;everal manners of living &s;he e|qually
&s;cattered the Crowns Revenue among&s;t
Strangers, by who&s;e Coun&s;el &s;he governed her
&s;elf in many things, and by her own head in all
the re&s;t. This gave occa&s;ion to one <HI>Mi&s;&s;enius,</HI> a
Phy&s;itian or Hi&s;torian, if I mi&s;take not, that had
been advanced by her, to publi&s;h a Book little to
her advantage. He highly extolled the Prince Pa|latin,
then declared Heir of the Crown, ad|dre&s;sing
him&s;elf to him and the Kingdoms Sena|tors,
for remedy of the di&s;orders he ob&s;erved.
<PB N="167" REF="88">
His Stile di&s;covered him, and the Queen made
appear very great moderation on occa&s;ion of his
ingratitude, and the Prince no le&s;s addre&s;s and
judgment, in &s;atisfying her that he too much de|te&s;ted
the Crime of that unworthy fellow, to
have contributed any thing towards it. All
this while a &s;ecret aver&s;ion for the Queen in&s;inu|ated
it &s;elf among&s;t the greate&s;t part of the Sena|tors
and People. Some &s;aid they mu&s;t have a
Soldier to command them, others lamented the
poverty of their Country, and that Rixdollers
were &s;o &s;carce among&s;t them. That Peace &s;uited ill
with a Countrey that produced nothing but iron,
which they ought to truck for the Ducats of <HI>Po|land</HI>
or Patagons of <HI>Germany.</HI> That an occa&s;i|on
of rupture with one of the&s;e could not be
wanting, that the truce with <HI>Poland</HI> was almo&s;t
at an end, and that they &s;tood in need of no|thing
but a King, either a <HI>Charles</HI> or another
<HI>Gu&s;tavus.</HI> That all that was defective in his
Daughter abounded in his Nephew; notwith|&s;tanding
all which their re&s;pect to the next blood
of that great King, &s;uffered them not to open
their mouths wide, nor to &s;peak publickly; but
whether it were that the Senators had more par|ticularly
expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to the Queen in
private, or that of her &s;elf &s;he well under&s;tood,
by the Conjuncture of Affairs and Inclination
of the People, that &s;he had not long to raign,
or el&s;e by &s;ome tran&s;port of Heroick fancy, or
were it that all the&s;e things together contributed
to her renunciation, it at la&s;t became publick to
the admiration of all the world. This change was
<PB N="168" REF="89">
the di&s;cour&s;e of all <HI>Europe,</HI> and as there had
not happened any thing in many Ages &s;o &s;upri|zing,
every man endeavored to find the cau&s;es
of it in a thou&s;and Chymerical rea&s;ons. This
great Queen was &s;o unfortunate, &s;he e&s;caped not
the teeth of Satyri&s;ts on occa&s;ion of it. They be|gan
by a bad opinion of her under&s;tanding, and
jealou&s;ie of ill guided Morals; her affections and
judgment &s;eemed very un&s;table, and her Ene|mies
reported &s;he quitted not a Crown and Scep|ter
on a Principle of Vertue to live to her &s;elf,
and in a &s;olitude where &s;he might the better cul|tivate
her Mind and exalt her Faith, but out of
of an inclination to wander, and expo&s;e to Fame
that Prodigy of the North &s;he had &s;o highly
vaunted. This &s;o feeble Motive of &s;o great an
Action made &s;ome conjecture it was not her
choice, but that her De&s;cent from the Throne
might be glorious, &s;he was permitted or advi&s;ed
to cover with the Mantle of Genero&s;ity and au|&s;tere
Vertue, the nece&s;&s;ity to which they redu|ced
her of re&s;igning the Crown to her Co&s;in be|fore
her death. That great Soul and vigorous
Intellect &s;he ever pretended to, on this occa&s;ion
doubtle&s;ly furni&s;hed her with &s;uch Maximes, it
repre&s;ented her re&s;igning the Soveraiguty as
much better than its for&s;aking her, and that by
anticipation of her defeat &s;he &s;hould triumph in
it: That a timely retreat is oftentimes better
than an ob&s;tinat combat. That a good Hor&s;eman
alights, when he perceives his Hor&s;e will not
carry him to his journeys end. That &s;he &s;hould
do well to imitate that Illu&s;trious Roman that
<PB N="169" REF="89">
vaunted to have been employed before him&s;elf
de&s;ired it, and to have quitted before it was de|&s;ired
by others; by the fir&s;t de&s;igning the effect
of his good fortune, and by the &s;econd giving
te&s;timony of his good Conduct. The Event
&s;hews &s;he yielded to the&s;e rea&s;ons, and the bet|ter
to di&s;gui&s;e all appearance of con&s;traint, omit|ted
nothing that might conceal her di&s;plea&s;ure.
<HI>Piementelli</HI> her Favorite wrote in &s;uch terms to
this Court, clearly di&s;covering the bottom of
this affair and humor of this Prince&s;s, with
which he had order to comply, and offer her all
manner of honour and good reception in the
Dominion of the King his Ma&s;ter. He effected
this without difficulty, becau&s;e &s;o well with her
that all was acceptable from him. Having en|tirely
re&s;igned her &s;elf to his Coun&s;el and Con|duct,
&s;he had no &s;ooner ca&s;t off the Royal Robe,
than &s;he left <HI>Swede</HI> in the Equipage and Habit
of a Modern Amazon. She did not only in her
actions retain nothing of the Cu&s;toms of her
Sex, who&s;e weakne&s;s was &s;o contemptible to her,
but avoided all conver&s;ation with it, her Atten|dants
and Servants were all Men, &s;corning to u&s;e
Women either at her ri&s;ing or going to bed.
Her own habit was mixed of what is u&s;ed by both.
A loo&s;e Coat reaching to the middle of her Leg,
and under it a kind of Ve&s;t almo&s;t to her Heel,
a Handkerchief like a Cravat about her Neck, a
Black Periwig, though her own Hair was flaxen;
with a Hat and Feather, were her ordinary Ac|coutrements,
or rather her Di&s;gui&s;e, while&s;t
&s;he travailed: Nay at <HI>Antwerp</HI> and <HI>Bru&s;&s;elles,</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="90">
where &s;he continued &s;ome time, &s;he changed
nothing; and they which have written of her,
repre&s;ent her in a Dre&s;s very little different. Hu|mor
or aver&s;ion made her alwayes (as much as
po&s;&s;ible) avoid the Vi&s;its of Women, and as
<HI>Thale&s;tris</HI> for <HI>Alexander,</HI> &s;o &s;he at fir&s;t expre&s;|&s;ed
a great impatience and extraordinary pa&s;&s;i|on
to &s;ee the Prince of <HI>Conde.</HI> She publickly
&s;aid, <HI>She was &s;orry there was no Hou&s;e in</HI> Bru&s;|&s;els
<HI>large enough to lodge them both; that he
was her Hero, and the only Man &s;he admired.</HI>
He was at that time at the Siege of <HI>Arras,</HI> whi|ther
&s;he writ to him &s;he would come, and after
his Example make no difficulty of wearing the
Spani&s;h Colours. This Prince having augment|ed
his glory, though by an unfortunate con|clu&s;ion
of that Enterpri&s;e, her de&s;ire of &s;eeing
him was redoubled; to te&s;tifie how much &s;he
was concerned in the honour he had acquired by
a retreat that had equalized the defeat of the
Spaniards, to the victory of their enemies. Af|ter
&s;o hand&s;om advances and obliging addre&s;&s;es
for an Interview &s;he pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired, one
would hardly believe &s;he could become cold, and
change &s;o many evident te&s;timonies of impati|ence,
to as vi&s;ible ones of indifference. One of
that Princes Agents told me, that out of an hu|mor
very extraordinary and &s;urprizing, &s;he &s;tu|died
Punctilio's on the form of his Reception,
when he was even ready to make his Vi&s;it. The
Arch-Duke after the rout before <HI>Arras,</HI> went
to &s;ee her at <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and &s;he received him with
exce&s;sive re&s;pects and honours; for not &s;atisfied
<PB N="171" REF="90">
to attend him at her Stair-foot, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed over
a great Court, and met him at her outer Gate.
The Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI> who&s;e courage may ju&s;tly
equali&s;e him to what is greate&s;t, and who&s;e birth
yields to few that wear not Crowns, de&s;ired to
know how &s;he would comport her &s;elf towards
him; tho&s;e he employed in this could never ob|tain
any &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, and therefore
doubting &s;he might make &s;ome difference
between him and the Archduke, he re&s;olved not
to &s;ee her: but becau&s;e he was already on his
way, and importuned not to come to an open
rupture, he re&s;olved of an expedient to &s;ee her
<HI>incognito.</HI> He therefore &s;ent his Train to attend
her as if him&s;elf were gone back, and that he
might &s;ee her unknown to her, re&s;olved to enter
her chamber when full of his people, and to ap|pear
no otherwi&s;e than as one of tho&s;e that wait|ed
on her on his account. At fir&s;t &s;he knew him
not, but at la&s;t di&s;covering him, when he went
away &s;he would have accompanied him; but he
told her <HI>he mu&s;t have all or nothing,</HI> and without
&s;taying for an an&s;wer went as he came. It is mo&s;t
certain that he whom &s;he looked on as the Hero
of this age, at that interview lo&s;t the opinion that
&s;he was the Heroine. Her re&s;olution yet, that
hath on &s;o many occa&s;ions been remarquable,
was not the principal cau&s;e of her inequality to|wards
him: It was a trick put upon her by the
<HI>Spaniards,</HI> contrived by <HI>Piementelli</HI> at in&s;tigati|on
of the Earl of <HI>Fuen&s;aldaigne,</HI> that was very
ill with him: For though the King of <HI>Spain</HI> had
expre&s;ly ordered that he &s;hould be treated e|qually
<PB N="172" REF="91">
with the Archduke, and the &s;ame honors
paid him, this was not the fir&s;t time that more
had been promi&s;ed at <HI>Madrid</HI> than performed at
<HI>Bruxels,</HI> &s;he who is entirely devoted to the <HI>Spani|ards,</HI>
and governs her &s;elf by their Councels on|ly,
did nothing on this occa&s;ion that was not a|greed
on with them: and mo&s;t certain that the
Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> made appear &s;uch a contempt of
their vanity, and indifference for her, that they
were a&s;hamed as well of their own as his pro|ceeding:
this obliged the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to endea|vour
their reconciliation, and to find a neutral
place where they might accidentally meet: which
happened in the <HI>Pall mall,</HI> where a game was
agreed on, in which both of them were on the
&s;ame &s;ide; but this had no effect, and they par|ted
with the &s;ame indifference as at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>What I have ob&s;erved of the humour and
comportment of this Prince&s;s, is but the &s;um of
what I have heard from tho&s;e that di&s;cour&s;e of
the de&s;igne of this Court in its many care&s;&s;es to
her: of which publick curio&s;ity hath gained &s;o
little light, we may conclude that nothing is &s;o
certain as the uncertainty of it. Some will have
that no Northern pui&s;&s;ance having been &s;o fatal
to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> as that of the Kingdom
&s;he abandoned, the chief Mini&s;ter aimed at ac|quiring
her affection, and making u&s;e of her ani|mo&s;ity
again&s;t her Country for di&s;covering its
greate&s;t &s;ecrets. To this fancy they add, that
it being improbable that the King that &s;ucceeds
her &s;hould continue long in peace with the Em|peror,
her Councils and Creatures that continue
<PB N="173" REF="91">
in <HI>Swede,</HI> may be u&s;eful as mo&s;t proper
again&s;t all corre&s;pondence he may have in <HI>Ger|many,</HI>
for thwarting the Election of the King
of the Romans, and forming a party capable
of recalling him, with another manner of pow|er
then what he had before <HI>Prague,</HI> when he
retired with &s;o great regret, and di&s;covered that
if he had not &s;o &s;trong a hand, nor &s;o long an
Arm as the great <HI>Gu&s;tavus</HI> his Uncle; he had
no le&s;s thir&s;t after victory. Others as ridicu|lous,
imagine that a principle of genero&s;ity and
bounty obliges the King to maintain an Amba&s;|&s;ador
with this Queen, to comfort her in her
Eclip&s;e of Dignity, by continuing &s;uch an ac|knowledgement
of Power and Honour; and
that to mitigate her re&s;entments, he will in time
make her Vice-Queen of <HI>Naples,</HI> or &s;ome other
Realm, where though &s;he command not over
&s;o largely extended a Dominion, nor with a pow|er
&s;o ablolute, as when &s;he &s;ate on the Throne,
&s;he will have the &s;atisfaction to enjoy a plea|&s;anter
Climate. There are that when they mu&s;t
needs acknowledge they cannot comprehend to
what purpo&s;e the chief Mini&s;ter is &s;o &s;olicitous
in cultivating this Queens good graces, have re|cour&s;e
to Zeal for Religion; and that he pro|po&s;eth
to him&s;elf no other end nor other glory,
then to cau&s;e an abjuration of her Faith, to fol|low
the renunciation of her Crown, and to &s;end
her to <HI>Rome</HI> as his triumph for &s;o great a work.
Whatever it be that moves the Spaniards to a
Negotiation, that to mo&s;t wits &s;eems very u&s;e|le&s;s;
this is mo&s;t certain that if they have com|placency
<PB N="174" REF="92">
for this Prince&s;s, &s;he hath no le&s;s for
them. For be&s;ides what I have already &s;aid, I
have had advice that at her arrival at <HI>Antwerp,</HI>
&s;he extolled the beauty of that City with &s;uch
exce&s;s, &s;he made no difficulty of preferring it
before the kingdom &s;he had quitted; nor of
&s;aying, <HI>She had rather be Marchione&s;s of</HI> Antwerp
then Queen of <HI>Sweden.</HI> It is mo&s;t certain, that
in <HI>Stockholm</HI> it &s;elf, in her familiar di&s;cour&s;e &s;he
made it manife&s;t, &s;he had no great value either
for her Countrey or Subjects, whither this were
a de&s;igne and fore&s;ight, that as &s;he &s;hould not
long command the latter, &s;o &s;he would &s;oon
quit the former, or an effectual aver&s;ion for
her people, cau&s;ed by frequentation of &s;tran|gers,
and contempt of her Countrey by rea&s;on
of the relations they made her of the benignity
of the Air they breathed in the parts where
they were born. Be&s;ides all this, it is well
known, that after &s;he had te&s;tified a de&s;ire to
become Mediatre&s;s of a peace between <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Spain,</HI> about which &s;he had di&s;cour&s;e with

<P>Having reported all that the Spani&s;h Criti|ci&s;ms
informed me in tho&s;e matters of State,
(whether Catholic or Paradoxical) which be|cau&s;e
of fre&s;he&s;t date are their mo&s;t u&s;ual en|tertainments,
and having mentioned their opi|nions
of tho&s;e that manage them, or that are
or have bin their principal or acce&s;&s;ary objects;
it is time to &s;ay &s;omething of &s;uch Mini&s;ters of
forreign Princes as I had the honour to be ac|quainted
with in this Court, the fir&s;t of the&s;e
was the Earl of <HI>Fie&s;chi,</HI> Agent for the Prince
of <HI>Conde;</HI> he was very kind to us, and being
as well one of the greate&s;t wits as Gallants of
the French Court; it is pity he hath engaged
him&s;elf in a party and employment that hath &s;o
much altered his con&s;titution, and changed his
humor, &s;o that he is hardly to to be known by
tho&s;e that have been mo&s;t particularly acquaint|ed
with him: he is fallen into a &s;ickne&s;s that
by intervals makes him pale, di&s;orders his pul&s;e
and di&s;ables him for company or di&s;cour&s;e. He
keeps a good Table, the Countrey he is in con|&s;idered:
<PB N="176" REF="93">
when we eat with him, it afflicted us
to &s;ee him in the middle of a meal ri&s;e from his
&s;eat and ca&s;t him&s;elf on a bed. At acce&s;s of the
fit, he &s;odainly changes colour, and one would
think him fainting: this is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the
effect alone of melancholly and di&s;plea&s;ure cau&s;|ed
by the troubles in which he is engaged, which
have &s;eparated him from his relations, e&s;tate,
and tranquility of the life he had wont to lead.
He took the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI>'s party out of in|clination
and genero&s;ity only, for it is &s;aid, he
had not the lea&s;t cau&s;e of di&s;content either from
the Court or chief Mini&s;ter, and his intere&s;t
would rather have led him to have followed
the Duke of <HI>Orleans</HI> and Madamoi&s;elle then a|ny
other, his wife relating to that Prince&s;s; but
he thought he was to go on, and not boggle
when he had once cho&s;en a ma&s;ter. After &s;er|ving
him well at <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> and &s;everal ren|counters,
he was &s;ent hither to give greater
reputation to the affairs of that Prince, man|aged
by <HI>St Agolin,</HI> in quality of Gentleman of
his chamber. At fir&s;t he endeavoured to divert
him&s;elf by all the recreations this place afford|ed,
be&s;ides which, he enjoyed one peculiar to
him&s;elf by rea&s;on of the excellent ver&s;es he com|po&s;ed:
he was plea&s;ed to repeat to us &s;ome &s;on|nets
he had made in prai&s;e of the Prince of <HI>Conde,</HI>
and almo&s;t a whole Scene of a piece he begun
in imitation of <HI>Senecas Medea:</HI> but neither love
nor the Mu&s;es had charms powerful enough a|gain&s;t
that di&s;content and melancholly, which
reduced him to the lamentable condition in
<PB N="177" REF="93">
which we lef him; his health being di&s;turbed
by &s;o frequent and &s;odain alterations as neither
him&s;elf, his friends, nor Phy&s;itians could under|&s;tand.
He therefore for&s;ook all plea&s;ures, for De|votions,
and in&s;tead of &s;eeking company that
might divert his thoughts from contemplating
his affairs and infirmity; he made <HI>la Ca&s;a del Cam|po,</HI>
his Hermitage, whither he often went, either
alone, or accompanied by one friend, whom he
tired with &s;ilent walking. The King allowed him
a Coach with four Hor&s;es, neither good nor bad;
but the Coachman and Footman very ill cloath|ed
for &s;ervants of &s;o great a King. Be&s;ides
this equipage which he commands when&s;oever
he plea&s;es; he hath his particular Train which
con&s;i&s;ts of Some Footmen, a Secretary, a Ma|&s;ter
of the Hor&s;e, a Page, and &s;ome other Of|ficers;
to maintain him&s;elf and them, the King
allows him 1800 Crowns a month and pays his
hou&s;e-rent: he wears the Spani&s;h habit, and &s;eems
&s;o far concerned in the intere&s;ts of that Court,
whither really, or to ju&s;tify his engagement with
it, that he &s;peaks of it with pa&s;&s;ion, and will
allow nothing to be comparable to the manner
of living in it; this is not becau&s;e without cau&s;e
of complaint&punc; but, (as is &s;uppo&s;ed) obliged by
prudence: He medles with little at pre&s;ent, as
well by rea&s;on of his indi&s;po&s;ition, as that the
Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> &s;ometime &s;ince, &s;ent one of his
Coun&s;ellors, who &s;eems to have the intrigue and
principal affairs in his hand; he is called <HI>Ma|zeroles,</HI>
and well qualified: he hath as much
Learning as is nece&s;&s;ary to manage the affairs of
<PB N="178" REF="94">
the time; he perfectly under&s;tands this Court
and Nation; his wit is &s;olid, yet quick and &s;up|ple;
his judgement exqui&s;ite, and in the affairs
he handles there needs be no di&s;tru&s;t of his
mi&s;taking the &s;hadow for the &s;ub&s;tance, nor
the point for the hilt; his conver&s;ation is both
agreeable and &s;erious in &s;uch a manner, that
none go from him without &s;atisfaction, and in|&s;truction
of many things remarkable in them|&s;elves
or circum&s;tances. In a word, one may &s;ay
of him that his parts are &s;olidly e&s;tabli&s;hed, both
by Art and nature, were he not tormented by
an A&s;tma, that gives him little repo&s;e. This
indilpo&s;ition was acquired by riding po&s;t on his
Ma&s;ters occa&s;ions, and it is &s;o violent, that for
&s;ome years he hath not &s;lept but in a chair,
not daring to lie in a bed, for fear of being
&s;uffocated by a defluxion and &s;hortne&s;s of wind.
The King of <HI>Spain</HI> allows him al&s;o one of his
Coaches, drawn by as many Hor&s;es as that which
attends the Earl of <HI>Fie&s;que.</HI> In the Palace which
is called <HI>Conde hou&s;e</HI> remain &s;till &s;ome of tho&s;e
that followed that Princes party, and accepted
not the <HI>Amne&s;ty;</HI> the chief of the&s;e is Mon|&s;ieur
<HI>de Trincars,</HI> Coun&s;ellor in the Parliament
of <HI>Bourdeaux,</HI> he is a man of parts and honour,
and that was very well with Mon&s;ieur <HI>d' E&s;per|non,</HI>
but that carried with the &s;tream, abandon|ed
him&s;elf to follow the fortune of the Prince
of <HI>Conde,</HI> when he came to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of
the Government of <HI>Ga&s;cone;</HI> that party decli|ning,
the Prince of <HI>Conti</HI> &s;ent him into <HI>England</HI>
to &s;olicite &s;uccors, whil&s;t he was there, they of
<PB N="179" REF="94">
<HI>Bourdeaux</HI> returned to their Kings obedience,
which expo&s;ed him to a great deal of rigor, the
effects of which, would have been &s;en&s;ible to
his E&s;tate, had it not been &s;ecured as his wives
Dowry. That his per&s;on might be in no le&s;s
&s;afety, he retired to this place; after which, the
Prince made him Intendant of his Army, but
he cannot obtain from the&s;e Mini&s;ters 500 pi&s;tols
the Prince gave him to be paid out of his pen|&s;ions;
neither doth he &s;olicite them longer, nor
pre&s;s any thing but his di&s;charge, which he
knows they will not grant without the 500 pi|&s;tols,
le&s;t his arrival with the Prince, give
him a new &s;ubject of complaint by &s;o much the
more ju&s;t, in that this Coun&s;ellor, whom he
&s;ummons to an imployment, in which he will
be nece&s;&s;ary to him, demands not any gratifi|cation
or <HI>Ajuda de co&s;ta,</HI> as it is here called, but
the payment of part of a &s;um that is due to him;
by what I gue&s;&s;ed, the difficulty lay not in the
expedition of the pa&s;port, but of the Money,
without which they would not have him go a|way.
In the &s;ame hou&s;e lives al&s;o an Agent of
Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Marcin</HI> who &s;olicits his Ma&s;ters pen|&s;ions
(which amounts to 12000 Crowns a year)
as General of the Kings Armies; be&s;ides the a&s;&s;ig|nation
the Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> gives on the Money
he draws from hence; all the&s;e and &s;ome others
that are in this hou&s;e, live on the 18 hundred
Crowns a month that are given the Earl of
<HI>Fie&s;que;</HI> it is true, that by the death of <HI>St Agolin</HI>
who was the Princes fir&s;t Envoye; this charge
will be &s;omewhat ea&s;ed: <HI>St Agolin</HI> was a Gen|tleman
<PB N="180" REF="95">
of <HI>Auvergne</HI> that lay &s;ick long, and was
at la&s;t killed by hot Medicines; they &s;peak very
plea&s;antly of his Doctors, who after &s;ix months
application of all manner of cold remedies, told
him, that &s;ince tho&s;e availed not, they mu&s;t try
hot ones, and &s;o brought him to his end, in
which he was happier then in &s;o cra&s;ie a life: I
&s;aw his Grave, and was pointed out one of the
&s;umptuo&s;ities of this Countrey, which requires
per&s;ons of quality to have crim&s;on Velvet or
red Sattin nailed to their Coffin, adorned
with gold and &s;ilver Lace, at lea&s;t on the &s;eams,
if not covered over.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Agent or Amba&s;&s;ador of forrain
Princes, was the Dukes of <HI>Florence;</HI> he is a
Clergy-man that wants not wit, of good meen,
and free and affable conver&s;ation. His brother,
whom we knew at the great Dukes Court, where
he is very con&s;iderable, had given us a Letter for
him, which we delivered quickly after our ar|rival
at <HI>Madrid:</HI> he received us well, and made
many offers of &s;ervice to my Lord . . . . . but
gave us occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve that the &s;tudy of <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI>
and its near relation to the <HI>Italian,</HI> made
it very difficult for us to u&s;e the latter without
mixture of &s;ome words of the former: nay &s;ome
<HI>Italians</HI> could &s;carcely avoid this, nor &s;peak their
own languaage with purity after acqui&s;ition of
&s;ome little of the <HI>Ca&s;tillian.</HI> No Prince in <HI>Italy</HI>
being more &s;treightened by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> than
the Great Duke, he alwayes keeps an Amba&s;&s;a|dor
in this Court to get intelligence of what|ever
pa&s;&s;es: for be&s;ides that which this King
<PB N="181" REF="95">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in the I&s;le of <HI>Elba,</HI> he is Ma&s;ter of the
be&s;t Havens in <HI>To&s;cany</HI> that belonged to the Re|publick
of <HI>Sienna,</HI> and therefore much concerned
in the affairs of this Crown particularly in tho&s;e
that belong to it in <HI>Italy.</HI> Seignior <HI>Encontri,</HI> of
whom I now &s;peak, is very intelligent in the&s;e
matters, and too active and quick-&s;ighted to be
ignorant of what pa&s;&s;es here. He di&s;covered
the Treaty of the <HI>Genoue&s;es</HI> with this King for ac|qui&s;ition
of <HI>Pontremoli;</HI> and as &s;oon as he had ven|ted
the mine, and recived the great Dukes or|ders
to act with all his might towards gaining a
place &s;o advantagious to him, he &s;o well thwarted
the <HI>Genoue&s;es</HI> in their Bargain, he broke it off,
and &s;truck up for his Ma&s;ter. In acknowledg|ment
of which that Prince a little after &s;ent the
Amba&s;&s;ador a hor&s;e of ma&s;&s;ie Gold, made &s;ome|time
before for <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, or <HI>Lewis</HI> the
thirteenth of <HI>France,</HI> and removing the effigies
of one of tho&s;e Kings which was of the &s;ame
mettal, there needed no more but to place in its
&s;tead that of <HI>Philip</HI> the fourth, to be pre&s;ented
to <HI>Don Lewis de Haro,</HI> who accepting it, decla|red
to do &s;o on no other termes, but to be&s;tow
it in his Ma&s;ters Cabinet, where, as was reported,
he effectively placed it. My Lord . . . . . made
many vi&s;its to this Amba&s;&s;ador, who al&s;o came
twice or thrice to &s;ee him; being an Eccle&s;ia&s;tick
he only wore along Robe, without taking the
habit of the Country.</P>
<P>The third forrain Mini&s;ter was Seignior <HI>Qui|rini,</HI>
Amba&s;&s;ador for the Republick of <HI>Venice:</HI>
He is very magnificent and &s;plendid, and of a
<PB N="182" REF="96">
meen altogether &s;uitable to the Maje&s;ty of that
<HI>Augu&s;t</HI> Senate: who&s;e dignity yet he better &s;up|ports
by an acquired knowledg of all that belongs
to a per&s;on of quality, accompanied by a judg|ment
who&s;e &s;olidity incomparably moderates the
exuberance of his memory in &s;uch a manner,
that the promptitude of the one never cla&s;hes a|gain&s;t
the maturity of the other.</P>
<P>A Gentleman of <HI>Piedmont</HI> called <HI>Ranu&s;io,</HI> who
had been &s;ent by the Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> to the Dut|che&s;s
of <HI>Mantua,</HI> his Aunt, made us known to
Seignior . . . . . Secretary of the Emba&s;&s;y, who
pre&s;ented us to that excellent per&s;on. He re|ceived
us perfectly well, and a&s;&s;ured my Lord
. . . . . that the memory of his Grandfather was
dear to the Senate, to whom he had been Am|ba&s;&s;ador,
and that they which then governed &s;aw
&s;o many excellent qualities in that great Per&s;o|nage,
they mentioned him to their Children&punc; as
one of the able&s;t headpieces had ever appeared
before them; after this he di&s;cour&s;ed with us
about the troubles of <HI>England,</HI> and the War be|tween
<HI>Cromwell</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> then lately ended,
and told us that the Seigniory of <HI>Venice,</HI> who
was the fir&s;t that &s;ent Amba&s;&s;adors to <HI>Henry</HI> the
fourth of <HI>France,</HI> before &s;eated on his Throne,
which the League with great might and fury di&s;|puted
again&s;t him, and that had made no diffi|culty
of acknowledging the States of the <HI>Low-Countries</HI>
when they had freed them&s;elves from
the Spani&s;h obedience, had not as yet &s;ent any
Amba&s;&s;ador into <HI>England</HI> to own that Repub|lick
or Protector. The rea&s;on he gave us was,
<PB N="183" REF="96">
that that prudent Senate would do nothing it
might be forced to revoke; and though the&s;e
later might &s;eem (however &s;o &s;odainly) better
e&s;tabli&s;hed than the former, they could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t
long, and would therefore wait till their power
were better &s;ettled, le&s;s tumultuary and precipi|tous
than as yet: That it would &s;ee what time
would do with them, le&s;t with other Sove|raigns
it might &s;uffer the di&s;plea&s;ure to have a|dre&s;&s;ed
it &s;elf to Mu&s;hrums, who &s;tarted up in
a night, and might vani&s;h in the morning; for
though the forces and indu&s;try of the King of
<HI>Great Britain</HI> had till that time failed of re&s;to|ring
him to his Throne, it was probable enough
he might recover it by means of internal revo|lutions,
and &s;uch flowings of State, as return
what the like ebbs have carried away. Vi&s;its
and acquaintance of this nature give a &s;oul to
travail, when a moment pre&s;ents one part of
what great Per&s;onages re&s;ident, in the Country
where he is, have been long acquiring. And as
&s;uch men ob&s;erve all with great exactne&s;s, and
have opportunity to do &s;o, their di&s;cour&s;es are
&s;ometimes more in&s;tructive than &s;ome years re|&s;idence,
they being u&s;ually mo&s;t open to &s;tran|gers.</P>
<P>The three Amba&s;&s;adors I have mentioned
were all we knew here, though there was al&s;o
one on accompt of the Emperor&punc; called <HI>Comte
Lambert,</HI> who &s;ucceeded the Comte of <HI>Grain;</HI>
but we never vi&s;ited him. At our being at <HI>Ant|werp</HI>
he was al&s;o there with all his Family; his
Wife is Daughter to <HI>Compte Wallen&s;tine,</HI> Lord
<PB N="184" REF="97">
High Chamberlain of his Imperial Maje&s;ty. He
received the Collar of the Golden Fleece from
the Kings own hands, and went away no le&s;s &s;a|tisfied
than we, by vacancy of &s;everal Chambers
in the Inne, for want of which we did little le&s;s
than Camp the night before his departure. He
is a tall man, thin-faced, and of no extraordina|ry
meen. They &s;ay he agreed better with this
Court than the Earl of <HI>Grain,</HI> a bold wit, that
made him&s;elf more feared than loved, that
&s;poke free truths to the King, and medled in
more than belonged to his charge: he &s;lighted
the Order, that no Coach, except the Kings and
Ma&s;ters of his Hor&s;e &s;hould be drawn with &s;ix
Mules or Hor&s;es in the Town. He did not think
him&s;elf obliged to ob&s;erve this, and &s;till went
through the &s;treets as formerly: He was once in
a pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t tho&s;e that admoni&s;hed him of
it in the Kings name, whereas the la&s;t complies
and u&s;es but four like other Amba&s;&s;adors.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Denmark</HI> hath al&s;o an Agent
here, but we had no acquaintance with him;

pa&s;&s;ed called him <HI>Lutheran;</HI> the King him&s;elf

terms more favourable. Be&s;ides &s;ome &s;mall in|tere&s;ts
of State of his Ma&s;ters in this Court I
think his re&s;idence is only to facilitate the Com|merce
of his Subjects and Allies, he was upon his
departure, and &s;taid only for a pa&s;s from <HI>France,</HI>

longer to trouble him&s;elf with ineffectual &s;oli|citations,
as that he had obtained (as he thought)
&s;omething for his Ma&s;ters intere&s;ts. He came
to demand the Pen&s;ions the <HI>Spaniards</HI> ought to
pay him according to Treaties made with him
in <HI>Germany,</HI> and of which the arrears mounted
very high, but he carried away nothing but Pa|per
with a&s;&s;ignations very incertain (as I was
told) and no ready mony, be&s;ides <HI>Aynda de
Co&s;ta,</HI> that is &s;omething to bear his charges.</P>

had at his landing in the Kingdom of <HI>Valentia</HI>

by the countenance and approbation of the
Condeduke, at that time Favorite, was &s;o great

wronging the Clergy, giving occa&s;ion to all of
them to take Arms for ree&s;tabli&s;hng their liber|ty.
The&s;e things &s;he often wrote both to the
King and his chief Mini&s;ter, particularizing all
exorbitancies committed, and danger of a gene|ral
revolt: But the Favourite cau&s;ed little regard
to be given to her advice, ever crying out &s;he

crediting the letters of the Mini&s;ters he had

of mind and body made evident, that if
heaven hath given them great advantages by
eminent birth, their education and docility have
contributed no le&s;s to that virtue and prudence

Mini&s;ters in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> to the be&s;t of this

dry, which continued to be &s;o till we came to
the River <HI>de los Henares,</HI> on which &s;tands the
City of <HI>Alcala,</HI> in Latin called <HI>Complutum.</HI> It is
very famous for its Univer&s;ity, founded (as is re|ported)

Law, alone equalls it.</P>
<P>The Town is long but narrow, having little
more than one fair &s;treet, in which the Scholars
<PB N="191" REF="100">
lodge. Here, as I was told, Cardinal <HI>Mazarin</HI>
was a Student, &s;ent by Cardinal <HI>Colonna</HI> when
Legate in <HI>Spain:</HI> the little River of <HI>Henares</HI> that
pa&s;&s;es by it makes the land about it fertil, and
renders it more agreeable than the re&s;t of the
Country, where for want of water there are nei|ther
trees nor gra&s;s: leaving here the po&s;te
Rode, and taking the &s;horte&s;t way that led to
<HI>Arragon,</HI> we lay at <HI>Marcamalo&punc;</HI> about 4 leagues
di&s;tant; this is a little Village without any thing
remarkable.</P>
<P>The <HI>18th</HI> we dined at <HI>Hita,</HI> a &s;mall Town
&s;eated on the top of a little hill &s;hadowed by a
greater: that night we lay at <HI>Cadadra</HI> a pretty
Town in a Valley: From hence we went the
next morning early, and dined at <HI>Saguen&ccedil;a;</HI>
we inned in the Suburbs, where we drunk wine
e&s;teemed the be&s;t of <HI>Ca&s;tile;</HI> but it is like <HI>aqua|vitae,</HI>
not only &s;trong but fiery, yet bears not
water. Having refre&s;hed our &s;elves, for we had
a very cool chamber, and plenty of &s;now, we
went to lodge at <HI>Fuente Caliente:</HI> or rather to
do penance there for the plea&s;ure we enjoyed
at noon. Its name (interpreted, the hot foun|tain)
is not given it without rea&s;on; we &s;uffer|ed
here very much, not only by heat, but bad
accommodation on all accounts; the Ho&s;t was
rude and barbarous, &s;uitable to &s;o &s;avage a habi|tation.</P>
<P>The <HI>20th</HI> over a very barren Countrey and
hot Mountains we came to <HI>Arcos,</HI> the la&s;t Town
of new <HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> where con&s;equently is a Puerto or
Cu&s;tomhou&s;e: It was a Sunday and Holiday, and
<PB N="192" REF="101">
the people all at Ma&s;s when we pa&s;&s;ed; we traver|&s;ed
it very lei&s;urely without any one's &s;aying any
thing to us; but as &s;oon as we were beyond a cer|tain
gate, by which we went from the Village
to the High-way, in that part very &s;treight by
rea&s;on of the Brook and Mountain, and had got|ten
about 100 paces beyond all the Barricado's,
we perceived people running and calling after us;
I &s;taied to know what they would have, and when
they overtook me, they told me the Puerto or
Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e was in that Town. I replied we
we were not Merchants, nor had any obligation
upon us on that account, having &s;ufficient
Pa&s;sports from the King, and that if they had
had any thing to &s;ay to us, they ought to have
done it in the Town, and there have acquainted
us that there was a Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, we having no
<HI>Moco de Mulas,</HI> or Guide to inform us. They
de&s;ired that one of us would go back to &s;hew
our Pa&s;s, which I did, though unadvi&s;edly; for
I have been told &s;ince we might have gone on,
and gained <HI>Arragon,</HI> and &s;o have avoided the
cavils and impudence of tho&s;e Harpies. When
I &s;hewed my Pa&s;s they &s;aid they mu&s;t call a
Council to con&s;ider if it were valid, and that
therefore I &s;hould &s;end to the Company to re|turn.
Which being done they told us we might
go <HI>a la Po&s;ada, e que toda la nue&s;tra ropa e&s;tava
de&s;caminada;</HI> that we might go to the Inn, for all
our baggage was confi&s;cated: then gue&s;&s;ing
they intended by terrifying to get money of us,
I bid them read our Pa&s;s, which was in the&s;e

<P>I thought this Pa&s;s &s;ufficient to prevent the&s;e
Publicans detaining us, but thir&s;t of gain in
which, on &s;everal other occa&s;ions they had had
&s;ucce&s;s again&s;t all Ju&s;tice and Rea&s;on, made them
ob&s;tinate by expectation of the like. I asked the
cau&s;e of their di&s;re&s;pect to His Maje&s;ties Pa&s;&s;e?
&s;ometimes they &s;aid it was &s;hewd too late, and
otherwhiles that it was not on &s;ealed paper; by
which I perceived they de&s;igned to bring us to
a compo&s;ition of 50 or 60 pi&s;tols. Finding us
<PB N="194" REF="102">
not at all compliable, and that I cau&s;ed a Cer|tificate
to be made by a publick Notary;
that <HI>Franci&s;co Salazar,</HI> Alcalde of the place,
&s;tayed us contrary to the Kings Pa&s;&s;e, (having
plotted together to that purpo&s;e) they began to
talk high, hoping &s;o to terrify us, and the Alcalde
&s;ei&s;ing our <HI>Vali&s;es,</HI> cau&s;ed them to be carried
to the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, where opening them he
took an Inventory of all, and not only of &s;uch
Money as we had in them, but in our pockets,
and forming an accu&s;ation, obliged us to put in
our an&s;wers; in which they endeavoured to cir|cumvent
us, but I looked &s;o near to what they
writ, I &s;uffered nothing to pa&s;s I had not &s;poken,
otherwi&s;e prote&s;ting again&s;t &s;igning it: the&s;e
many formalities were made u&s;e of to fright
us with the name of Ju&s;tice, of which, all their
noi&s;e and &s;cribling coming &s;hort, a Prie&s;t that
belonged to them and another fellow that did
the Office of a Secretary, told me in private,
that giving 50 pi&s;tols we might go freely; I
&s;lighted this, but told them, I cared not if I gave
them 30 Patagons, though their in&s;olence did
not de&s;erve it. And &s;uch indeed it was, parti|cularly
on the part of the <HI>Alcalde Salazar,</HI> a
Knight of <HI>St Jago,</HI> but an arrant <HI>ra&s;cal</HI> as well
as the Cu&s;tomer <HI>Nicholas Lopes de Cordoua</HI> that
had the meen of a Jew; at la&s;t they became
impudent and de&s;perately outragious when they
&s;aw they could not effect their de&s;ign of plunder|ing
us; and perceiving it, re&s;olved that I &s;hould
return po&s;t to <HI>Madrid,</HI> to complain of them and
de&s;ire Ju&s;tice; they al&s;o provided one to carry
<PB N="195" REF="102">
their Ju&s;tification to the Receiver-General of
the Cu&s;toms, and &s;ent him away afoot: the re|mainder
of the day was &s;pent in &s;uch conte&s;ta|tions
with them, but at la&s;t they &s;uffered me
to go about Eight in the evening; their me&s;|&s;enger
being fir&s;t di&s;patched: My Lord&mdash;
writ all to the Earl of <HI>Pigneranda.</HI> I was im|po&s;ed
upon by them at my fir&s;t mounting, in
the prices of the Hor&s;es; no Po&s;ts in the world
furni&s;ht with better then tho&s;e of <HI>Spain,</HI> nor that
are le&s;s ridden; for, excepting &s;uch as carry
Letters and &s;ome extraordinary Couriers that
are &s;ent to Court from &s;everal parts, e&s;pecial|ly
<HI>St Seba&s;tians</HI> and <HI>Catalonia,</HI> this way is lit|tle
made u&s;e of, they preferring Hackney Mules:
which indeed are more commodious, as I found
by experience on this occa&s;ion, for though the
Hor&s;es be good, one is tormented by wretch|ed
Saddles, with very narrow Seats, high Pum|mels,
and extraordinary hard. So that to be
mounted in &s;uch a manner, one is little more at
ea&s;e then on a rack. At the 3d Stage, the hor|&s;es
for all furniture had only Pannels with wood|en
&s;tirrups hung in Ropes. Finding fault with
&s;uch equipage; the Po&s;tma&s;ter told me, it was
not &s;trange he had no Saddles, and that I &s;hould
find the pannel ea&s;ier, I complied, and at fir&s;t
was in a great deal of di&s;order, becau&s;e I could
not &s;ettle on the &s;tirrups, and by rea&s;on of the
extraordinary breadth of the pannel; but this
pa&s;&s;ed over, I liked their Pannels better then their
Saddles, and called for one at the next Stage,
but could not have it, and took a Saddle, not &s;o
<PB N="196" REF="103">
convenient as the Pannel I was &s;o unwilling
to ride on. At the 3d Stage they took me for
the expre&s;s of <HI>Catalonia,</HI> carrying &s;ome good
news to the King, which I did not much con|tradict,
becau&s;e I found my &s;elf better u&s;ed on
account of it; they demanding for each Hor&s;e
but four Rials, about 2 s. 6 d. of our Money.
Few Po&s;t-ma&s;ters keep above two or three hor|&s;es;
neither are they obliged to more, They
have Salaries of 3 or 400 Crowns; nay &s;ome
500, for the keeping only of two Hor&s;es and a
Po&s;t-Boy. The Earl of <HI>Ognate</HI> is Po&s;t-ma&s;ter-General,
which is very profitable to him; my
Hor&s;es were every where very good, and gal|loped
all the way, but the Po&s;tilions often &s;top|ping
to give them breath, which they call <HI>Re|zelar,</HI>
is very trouble&s;ome: Be&s;ides, that at chan|ging
Hor&s;es, e&s;pecially in the night, they are
very tedious. The Po&s;t way is not the &s;ame we
pa&s;&s;ed in going to <HI>Arcos,</HI> but over a very fer|tile
Plain, watered by the River <HI>de los Henares;</HI>
5 or 6 Leagues are often rid on the &s;ame hor&s;es,
becau&s;e the Po&s;ts are not e&s;tabli&s;hed as they
ought to be at every two Leagues.</P>
<P>Arriving at <HI>Madrid,</HI> after &s;ome repo&s;e, and
dining with Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Mogeron,</HI> I was forced
to &s;top till the heat of the middle of the day pa&s;|&s;ed
over, before I could endeavour any thing in
my bu&s;ine&s;s, for all here &s;leeping after dinner,
I could not &s;ee the Earl of <HI>Pigneranda</HI> (with
whom I re&s;olved to begin, and for whom I had
a Letter) till about five a clock; and there|fore
in the interim, went to con&s;ult of my bu|&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="197" REF="103">
with &s;ome friends, and meeting in the
<HI>Calle Major,</HI> a very hone&s;t Fleming, called
Don <HI>Pedro,</HI> that under&s;tood this Court well,
and &s;poke excellent Spani&s;h, giving him account
of our accident, he drew a Memorial to be pre|&s;ented
by the Earl of <HI>Pigneranda</HI> to the Coun|cil
Royal, not doubting of my &s;ucce&s;s, but ad|vi&s;ing
me not to be impatient of delays, it be|ing
mo&s;t certain, that this people as much ob|&s;erve
formalities in the &s;lighte&s;t affairs, as in
tho&s;e of the highe&s;t concernment, and withal
letting me under&s;tand there was great indulgence
for Farmers of Cu&s;toms, becau&s;e the Kings princi|pal
Revenue, ri&s;ing from it, their exactions are
&s;ometimes connived at. Indeed, Taxes on land
bring up little or nothing in <HI>Spain,</HI> becau&s;e the
Countrey is not &s;ufficiently manured, and were
Husbandmen burthened, would be le&s;s &s;o, even
to a want of nece&s;&s;ary &s;u&s;tenance. He told me
more, that when the Cu&s;toms are Farmed, it is
done in &s;o ab&s;olute a manner, that nothing p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;|&s;es,
not for the Kings own u&s;e, without paying;
and if he give any exemptions, they are deduct|ed
from the Rent the Farmers agreed for. Tho&s;e
fellows therefore make u&s;e of a hundred cheats
(too tedious to be here related) in order to
confi&s;cation, which if they cannot effect with
ju&s;tice, they forge fal&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, and under
pretence of the Kings rights, exerci&s;e their Ra|pine
with Soveraignty, and are &s;o in&s;olent, that
on all occa&s;ions they vaunt them&s;elves to be the
Kings &s;ervants; and a wretched waiter or other
&s;pawn of a Publican, will &s;ometimes be fancy
<PB N="198" REF="104">
enough to threaten an hone&s;t man to beat him,
or break open his Trunk if he be &s;low in de|livering
the Key. In <HI>France</HI> one &s;uffers no le&s;s
by the extravagant greedine&s;s of this kind of cat|tle;
and I cannot forget the pains they took at
<HI>Diep,</HI> to &s;end an Army of Guards aboard the
ve&s;&s;el I arrived in, to vi&s;it my <HI>Vali&s;e,</HI> to&s;&s;ing up
and down my cloaths, annd taxing a bit of cloth
that remained of a &s;uit I had made at <HI>London</HI>
two Crowns; &s;o that if Princes or their Mini|&s;ters
limit not their exactions, Travailers are
mi&s;erably expo&s;ed to them, and this is their great
&s;courge, the more to be apprehended, becau&s;e
&s;eldom or never puni&s;hed: the greate&s;t part of
tho&s;e fellows in <HI>Spain</HI> are thought to be Jews,
and when their plunderings have gorged them
with wealth, the trap of the inqui&s;ition is &s;et for
them. Going at nine a clock to the Earl of
<HI>Pignerandas,</HI> he was not returned, but I ac|quainted
his Secretary Don <HI>Martin</HI> with my
bu&s;ine&s;s, de&s;iring him to move it to his Lord,
and to give him the Letter I brought from my
Lord&mdash;with the Memorial: the next day
about the &s;ame hour I went again, and found
that Lord very much troubled at what had
happened to us, who after, offering me a Coach,
Money, and all el&s;e in his power, de&s;ired me
to have a little patience, and told me he was
very &s;orry my Lords&mdash;and&mdash;were in
&s;o bad a place, and arre&s;ted by the in&s;olence of
tho&s;e <HI>Picaros,</HI> who &s;hould be exemplarily pu|ni&s;hed,
and we receive all manner of &s;atis|faction:
the like I did to Don <HI>Lewis de Haro,</HI>
<PB N="199" REF="104">
and found the like civility. To make &s;hort, my
&s;olicitations had &s;uch effect, that the King ap|pointed
a Commi&s;&s;ion to be di&s;patched by the
Council of <HI>Ca&s;tille</HI> for an <HI>Alguazil de Corte,</HI> and
a Secretary to go along with me to <HI>Arcos</HI> and
bring <HI>Franci&s;co Salazar</HI> to the publick pri&s;on
of <HI>Madrid</HI> in order to his puni&s;hment, and
an ampler Pa&s;sport was given me that we might
no more apprehend the like inconvenience.</P>
<P>The Alguazil and Secretary that were ap|pointed
to go with me, refu&s;ed to travail by
night, or to ride Po&s;t, &s;o that I was fain to tar|ry
till the 26th of <HI>June,</HI> and then return by
Mule. Experience taught me, that this way of
travailing, is very inconvenient; for, be&s;ides
that, for more expedition, the Mules always
trot, one cannot expre&s;s how much their hard
mouths pre&s;s and weary the hand, nor what a
torment it is, going down hill to &s;uffer their &s;low
progre&s;&s;ion. Being thus excellently mounted,
and in this honourable company; I neglected
nothing towards my &s;peedy arriving at <HI>Arcos,</HI>
whither I came the 29th of <HI>Iune,</HI> and found the
Lord&mdash;and&mdash;already adverti&s;ed of the
&s;ucce&s;s of my journey by a Letter from <HI>Madrid;</HI>
I immediately carried the <HI>Alguazil</HI> and Secre|tary
to execute their Commi&s;&s;ion; the Alcalde
was much &s;urprized, but making u&s;e of his pri|viledge,
as Knight of the Order of <HI>St Iames,</HI>
refu&s;ed to obey without a Mandate from the
Council of the Orders. My <HI>Alguazil</HI> who was
of the higher Order, and one of tho&s;e that are
called <HI>Alguazil de Corte,</HI> often &s;ummoned him to
<PB N="200" REF="105">
go along with him to <HI>Madrid</HI> as his pri&s;oner,
but he &s;till refu&s;ed to obey, of which the <HI>Al|guazil</HI>
took witne&s;s, &s;aying; he could not u&s;e
force, becau&s;e that Town belonging to the Duke
of <HI>Medina Celi,</HI> there was no <HI>Corrigidor above</HI>
the <HI>Alcalde,</HI> but that this would undo the <HI>Al|calde,</HI>
and that he doubted not to return from
<HI>Madrid</HI> with power to carry him thither bound
hands and feet; and we heard afterwards, that
(as Spani&s;h ju&s;tice never pardons) he was pu|ni&s;hed
according to his de&s;erts; the re&s;t of the
Officers of the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e &s;eeing the bad
condition of their Protector, were as compli|able
and civil as they had been arrogant and in|&s;upportable:
they returned all that belonged to
us without the lea&s;t diminution, and they which
before pretended to plunder us, and threaten|ed
that we &s;hould pay for the tedious writings
they had drawn, de&s;ired now nothing more
then to be quit, not only of us, but of the prey we
had redeemed from their clutches: we had no
le&s;s impatience to get from among&s;t &s;uch Ra&s;cals,
which that we might the &s;ooner do, we con|tented
our &s;elves, to recommend the puni&s;h|ment
of them to tho&s;e other Harpies, who &s;el|dom
&s;uffer &s;uch as they &s;ei&s;e on to e&s;cape, gi|ving
them all damages and co&s;ts we might
pretend the more to incite them to our re|venge.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as freed from tho&s;e troubles, we
made all ha&s;te towards <HI>Arragon.</HI> Several parts of
this <HI>Province</HI> are very agreeable, and when we
had left the Mountains that inclo&s;e <HI>Arcos,</HI> we
<PB N="201" REF="105">
came to very plea&s;ant Vallies, and the 29th of
<HI>Iune</HI> in the evening, entred <HI>Erizza</HI> or <HI>Herizo,</HI>
the fir&s;t Town on that &s;ide of that kingdom: the
next day we dined at <HI>Texa,</HI> that hath nothing
remarkable, and lay at <HI>Callatajud&punc;</HI> one of the
principle Cities of the Kingdom, &s;eated at the
end of a very fertile Plain, but in nothing con|&s;iderable,
unle&s;s in giving birth and abode to
<HI>Lorenzo Brachian Infanzon,</HI> a modern writer,
very famous among&s;t the Spaniards; he hath
publi&s;hed &s;everal Treati&s;es of Morality and Po|licy,
among&s;t which, one is called <HI>el Criticon,</HI>
of which, two parts only are printed, a kind
of Satyr, very ingenious in imitation of <HI>Barclais
Euphormio:</HI> in this piece his &s;tile differs much very
from tho&s;e &s;mall Treati&s;es in which he is &s;o con|ci&s;e,
abrupt, and &s;trangely laconick, one would
think he had made it his bu&s;ine&s;s to be ob&s;cure;
the Reader mu&s;t often divine his &s;en&s;e, which
found, he perceives an <HI>enigma</HI> hath been made
of &s;omething not very extraordinary. <HI>Seneca</HI>
and <HI>Tacitus</HI> are very &s;hort of him in this man|ner
of writing, and if it be &s;aid of the former,
that his Stile is Sand without Lime, and that
the &s;econd is &s;o my&s;terious, he contains more
then he expre&s;&s;es: we may conclude that of
<HI>Gracian,</HI> hath &s;o little connexion in its periods
and &s;o much re&s;traint in its words, that the con|ception
is like a Diamond ill &s;et, who&s;e flame
and lu&s;ter appear not &s;o that it loo&s;es the e&s;teem
of the better half of the work.</P>
<P>There lives in the &s;ame Kingdom another
<HI>Virtuo&s;o,</HI> affecting like him the <HI>Lacedemonian</HI>
<PB N="202" REF="106">
eloquence, he is called <HI>Vincencio Ivan de La&s;ti|no&s;a.</HI>
by who&s;e means mo&s;t of the works of
<HI>Gracian</HI> are printed. This <HI>La&s;tanno&s;a</HI> is looked
on as the mo&s;t curious per&s;on of <HI>Spain;</HI> he dwels
at <HI>Hue&s;ca,</HI> the &s;econd City of <HI>Arragon,</HI> where
he is reported to have collected a Cabinet
that is a very agreeable Theatre of Grecian
and Roman antiquities; there are many Statues,
Va&s;es, Urnes, Arms, Precious Stones, antient
Moneys, Medals and Rings; in which he is &s;o
well &s;tudied, that he hath written a Treati&s;e of
the antient Moneys of <HI>Spain,</HI> which pa&s;&s;es for
exqui&s;ite in its kind, and rare in its ob&s;ervations.
The fir&s;t of <HI>July</HI> having dined at <HI>Ofranco</HI> we lay
at <HI>Almunia,</HI> &s;eated in a fruitful valley, and
yielding a fair pro&s;pect on which &s;ide &s;oever it
is beheld: <HI>Sarago&s;a</HI> is but nine Leagues from
it, and we intended to dine the next day at
<HI>la Muela,</HI> and to arrive before the heat, but
unhappily lo&s;t our way on a great heath, with|out
hou&s;e, tree, bu&s;h, or water; it extended even
to the walls of <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a,</HI> without giving any
opportunity to refre&s;h, or to avoid the Suns
beams for 5 or 6 Leagues. It fell out well for us,
that the day was not exce&s;&s;ively hot, &s;o that
our &s;ufferings were not extreme, though
&s;ome of the company were in no little choller,
to ride &s;o far without drawing bit, and com|plained
no le&s;s then if they had traver&s;ed the
Sands of <HI>Libia,</HI> but it is folly to be troubled
where no remedy can be had, and before our
patience was quite tired, half a League &s;hort of
<HI>Sarago&s;a</HI> we came to a Brook, where we all
<PB N="203" REF="106">
alit to refre&s;h our &s;elves, and as nothing &s;eems
hard to a &s;harp hunger, our vehement thir&s;t
made that water (none of the be&s;t) to be drunk
with plea&s;ure: we came at la&s;t to <HI>Sarrago&s;&s;a</HI>
the capital City of <HI>Arragon,</HI> &s;eated in a large|ly
extended Plain; it is divided by the River
<HI>Ebro,</HI> but the greate&s;t part of it on the &s;ide where
we arrived. A little &s;hort of it is an old Ca&s;tle
called <HI>Alta Feria;</HI> with a pitiful graft about it,
we were told it had formerly bin a palace of
their Kings, and was then of the Inqui&s;ition.
The Farmer of the Cu&s;toms had Guards at the
Gate, who hearing that our &s;ervants followed
with our baggage, detained us not long: we de|&s;ired
notice might be given them, that they &s;hould
know where we lodged at the hou&s;e of one <HI>Red|mondon</HI>
a Merchant, for whom we had Letters
of credit; we alit at his hou&s;e and found him
at dinner, he pre&s;ented us very good Wine,
which refre&s;hed us, and re&s;tored the vigor the
long journey and exce&s;&s;ive heat had deprived
us of; he afterwards brought us to the be&s;t Inn
in the Town, where we had a fair and cool
room, and to prevent our <HI>Vali&s;es</HI> being de|tained
at the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, whither they mu&s;t
of nece&s;&s;ity be brought; I went to &s;peak with
the Arrendador-General, and &s;hew him our
Pa&s;s, which obliged him to be civil and to &s;end
us our baggage as &s;oon as it came to him; we
tarried here all day to repair our lo&s;s of bait|ing
at <HI>la Muelan;</HI> &s;ome of the company went
to bed, others only ca&s;ting off their clothes,
<PB N="204" REF="107">
&s;hifted their Linnen. Mon&s;ieur&mdash;who ar|rived
la&s;t, was the mo&s;t thir&s;ty, though not the
mo&s;t weary, therefore he lay not down; but at
his fir&s;t coming in, drank &s;o much water, and
afterwards &s;o much wine to correct its crudity,
he became &s;ick, be&s;ides too &s;uddain an attempt
to quench his thir&s;t; he walked long unbutton|ed,
and almo&s;t naked, not only about the hou&s;e,
but came to us in &s;lippers and without doublet,
where we were on the banks of <HI>Ebro</HI> that ran
behind the Inn, where we &s;ucked a gentle gale
that came down the river; on the morrow a
Feavor took him which continued 5 or 6 days,
and obliged us to tarry 10 in that City: &s;oon
after our arrival we vi&s;ited the Duke of <HI>Mon|teleon,</HI>
Viceroy of this Kingdom; he is one of
the greate&s;t Noblemen of <HI>Naples,</HI> of whom in
the la&s;t revolution of that City, the Spaniards
became jealous, though he had &s;erved them ad|vatagiou&s;ly
in the former: that they might no
longer fear him they &s;ent for him into <HI>Spain,</HI>
and that they might di&s;gui&s;e their di&s;tru&s;t, made
him Viceroy of <HI>Arragon.</HI> This Charge is ho|nourable,
but not profitable, the King allowing
but little, and the Kingdom bringing in le&s;s,
neither is any thing &s;plendid in his family; we
delivered him the Kings Letter, and that of
Don <HI>Lewis;</HI> having read them in our pre&s;ence,
he made us offers of all that lay in his power:
he &s;eemed not to us of a Genius much elevated,
whither his re&s;entments of the Spaniards ill u&s;age
have dejected it, or whither he conceals a part,
lea&s;t o&s;tentation of the whole might be preju|dicial
<PB N="205" REF="107">
to him. Be&s;ides the Viceroy, who&s;e charge
cea&s;es every three years; here is a Governour of
the City, or rather of the Countrey, &s;ince his
power is reported principally to extend over it;
this Charge is the more con&s;iderable becau&s;e for
life.</P>
<P>Though the Viceroyalty and Government of
<HI>Sarago&s;&s;a</HI> are the two great charges of this King|dom,
yet no authority is equal to that of the
Chief Ju&s;tice, called <HI>El Ju&s;ticia,</HI> to &s;hew that he
is to <HI>do ju&s;tice</HI> in all and above all: &s;o that he
determines of what concerns the King, King|dom,
Subjects, Laws and Priviledges: but for
the better under&s;tanding this, and that which I
&s;hall hereafter ob&s;erve touching the great con|te&s;tation
here between high powers: it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
that I &s;et down what I have been told
concerning the Priviledges of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>After the Moors had entred <HI>Spain,</HI> on occa|&s;ion
of the Injuiry done by <HI>Don Rodrigo</HI> to
Comt <HI>Don Julian</HI> in per&s;on of his Daughter,
called <HI>la Cava,</HI> whom he ravi&s;hed, <HI>Arragon</HI>
was the fir&s;t Province that freed it &s;elf from the
yoke of the Infidels, and that finding not only
the race, but memory of its ancient Kings total|ly
extinct, by it &s;elf, made a recovery of
its &s;elf, to it &s;elf, without owning any Sove|raign.
But le&s;t they &s;hould be a Body without a
Head, and that they might enjoy &s;ecure repo&s;e
in their new liberty, they &s;oon after deliberated
of electing a King, and ca&s;t their eyes on a pri|vate
Gentleman called <HI>Garcia Ximenez.</HI> It mu&s;t
yet be acknowledged that they made him rather
<PB N="206" REF="108">
Prince or Pre&s;ident of their State than their So|veraign;
and in imitation of the <HI>Spartans,</HI> &s;o
much limited his authority, that that of <HI>Theo|pompus</HI>
was not more &s;treightned by the <HI>Ephori,</HI>
than that of this King by the rules impo&s;ed upon
him: and it being very ea&s;ie to violate the mo&s;t
fundamental Laws of a State, when the &s;upreme
power is concerned &s;o to do, if there be none
with hazard of his life obliged to watch for their
pre&s;ervation, they e&s;tabli&s;hed <HI>El Ju&s;ticia,</HI> a Ma|gi&s;tracy
of which I have &s;poken, that who
might fear nothing in the vigorous executing his
charge, they ordered he &s;hould not be liable to
condemnation either in per&s;on or goods on
what accompt &s;oever, but in the general A&s;&s;em|bly
of E&s;tates called <HI>las Cortes,</HI> that is the King
and Kingdom.</P>
<P>Having thus bound up him they &s;hould elect
for their King, they made a Law called <HI>de la Va|jon,</HI>
which imported that as &s;oon as the King in|fringed
their Priviledges, it &s;hould be in their
power to elect another, though a Pagan; and in
ca&s;e of wrong to any Va&s;&s;al or Subject, the No|bility
and mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the Realm might
a&s;&s;emble to protect him, and hinder any duties
to be paid the King, till the party injured were
indemnified, and the Priviledge re-e&s;tabli&s;hed
in its former validity. They erected <HI>El Ju&s;ti|cia</HI>
as Gardian of this Law, (with &s;everal others,)
who for greater authority &s;ate in a Chair with
his hat on his Head, whil&s;t the King bare and on
his knees &s;wore their Priviledges between his
hands: afterwards they owned him as their
<PB N="207" REF="108">
King, but in a very grange fa&s;hion; for in&s;tead
of vowing fidelity, they told him <HI>nos que valemos
tanto como vos os hazemos nue&s;tro Rey y Sennor, con
tal que guardeis nue&s;tros fueros y libertades, &s;ino,
no:</HI> that is, We that are equal to you make you
our King and Lord, on condition that you pre|&s;erve
our Laws and Liberties, and if not, not.
This dete&s;table fa&s;hion of owning a King &s;o
much di&s;gu&s;ted <HI>Don Pedro,</HI> &s;urnamed <HI>the Dagger,</HI>
that partly by intreaty, partly by intrigue, and
offering other Priviledges in the place of it, he
cau&s;ed it to be aboli&s;hed in an A&s;&s;embly of the
E&s;tates, and as &s;oon as he got the Parchment in
which the Law for it was written, voluntarily
cutting his hand, he &s;aid; that a Law which im|ported
that Va&s;&s;als might elect and limit their
King, was to be effaced with the blood of a King.
<HI>Ley de poder elegir Rey los Va&s;&s;allos &s;angre de Rey
avia de Co&s;tar,</HI> the&s;e are reported to be the ve|ry
words he pronounced, on which occa&s;ion
the &s;urname of <HI>the Dagger</HI> was given to him:
His Statue is yet to be &s;een in <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a,</HI> in the
Hall of Deputation, with the Dagger in one
hand, and the Priviledge cancelled with his
blood in the other. And indeed the &s;acred blood
of Kings can on no accompt be better employ|ed
(no not again&s;t a forain Enemy) then in &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing
&s;uch exorbitant Priviledges of Subjects
as de&s;troy the very foundation of Monarchy.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the two Priviledges I have mentioned,
not at all regarded by later Kings, there is ano|ther
&s;till in force called the Law of manife&s;ta|tion:
by this every Subject that thinks him&s;elf
<PB N="208" REF="109">
injured either in goods or per&s;on, by what Tri|bunal
&s;oever, may complain <HI>a el Ju&s;ticia,</HI> who
is obliged to make an exact enquiry, and cau&s;e
the Judge that hath given a corrupt &s;entence
to be puni&s;hed. This City at our being there
was much di&s;contented, becau&s;e endeavours
were u&s;ed to violate this Law. Teo Judges
were accu&s;ed for a Sentence by which a certain
Woman thought her&s;elf injured, who, according
to cu&s;tome, deputed 500 Crowns, and com|plained
of the Judges. The King, the Tribunal
<HI>d'el Ju&s;ticia,</HI> the Viceroy, the Governor, and
&s;ome others that &s;ought to augment the Autho|rity
of the Prince, and le&s;&s;en the Kingdoms
Priviledges, took the&s;e Judges into their prote|ction.
The Party grieved finding &s;he could get
no remedy, for the wrong &s;he pretended done
to her &s;elf and the Law, had recour&s;e <HI>a las Cor|tes,</HI>
or the States of the Kingdom, who (though
the Inqui&s;ition favoured the Judges that were
accu&s;ed) deputed Commi&s;&s;ioners called here
<HI>Judicantes.</HI> The&s;e are 9 per&s;ons drawn from
the four Bodies of <HI>Arragon,</HI> that is the higher
Nobility intituled <HI>Sennores,</HI> the Clergy, the Gen|try
called <HI>Hidalgos,</HI> or <HI>Cavalleros,</HI> and the Ci|ties.
From the fir&s;t of the&s;e Bodies three are
taken, and from each of the other two they u|&s;ually
make choice of the mo&s;t illiterate to
judge Gown-men, whether that it may be done
without partiality, or that their Laws ought to
be &s;o plain, that even Pea&s;ants and others the
mo&s;t ignorant may under&s;tand their equity, and
judge if it hath been ob&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="109">
The&s;e 9 Deputies or Commi&s;&s;aries condem|ned
the Judges of inju&s;tice, and ordered them
to be bani&s;hed, and their E&s;tates confi&s;ca|ted.
This Sentence made great noi&s;e, and the
Viceroy and Governor by order of the Court did
their be&s;t to hinder its effect, nay the King him|&s;elf
writ to the <HI>Ju&s;ticia.</HI> The People concerned
them&s;elves in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and Pa&s;quils and
Libels were every where ca&s;t abroad with mena|ces,
&s;hould it not be put in execution. Coun|trey
people flocked to the Town, entertain|ing
them&s;elves only with the violation of their
Priviledges. Doubt that this affair going to ex|tremity
might cau&s;e great di&s;orders, in a time
when the War of <HI>Catalonia</HI> made the People of
<HI>Arragon</HI> more fierce and hardie, cau&s;ed the Vice|roy
and other favourers of the Judges, without
any farther un&s;ea&s;onable mention of the Kings
plea&s;ure to &s;uffer them to be di&s;mi&s;t from their
charges, and bani&s;hed the Town. Were the like
practi&s;ed in all places, there would not be &s;o
many &s;entences given out of favor, pa&s;&s;ion, and
intere&s;t, rather than according to law and equi|ty,
not di&s;tingui&s;hable but in this one part of
<HI>Europe,</HI> where the Judges are reported to trem|ble
when they give &s;entence, fearing it may be
their own condemnation, either as to body or
goods, if unju&s;t or erroneous in the lea&s;t. Not|with&s;tanding
all this, ju&s;tice here is &s;overaign;
for though the Judge that hath determined a|mi&s;s
be puni&s;hed, the Sentence he hath pro|nounced
remains in full efficacy: &s;o that he
which accu&s;es his Judge hath only the &s;atisfacti|on
<PB N="210" REF="110">
of revenge, and &s;erves the Publick rather
than him&s;elf, by pre&s;erving the Peoples Privi|ledges,
in pro&s;ecuting him that hath done wrong,
and putting other Judges in mind of their duties.
He that is found to have accu&s;ed his Judge
without cau&s;e only lo&s;es the 500 Crowns he de|po&s;itated,
and though it appear he have rea&s;on,
recovers little more, which in that ca&s;e is levied
on the E&s;tate of the unju&s;t Judge. The bani&s;hment
of tho&s;e two Judges freed <HI>Sarago&s;&s;a</HI> from appre|hen&s;ion
of troubles, the People, by execution of
the Sentence, &s;atisfying them&s;elves, that at that
time no attempt would be made upon their Pri|viledges.</P>
<P>Had we continued longer at <HI>Sarrago&s;&s;a</HI> we
might have &s;een a Ceremony ob&s;erved in be|heading
Murtherers; for he which hath &s;lain a
man face to face, receives the &s;troke that
beheads him before; but &s;uch as treacherou&s;ly
came behind him are puni&s;hed in the &s;ame man|ner:
this is only for di&s;tinction &s;ake, for pro|bably
the blow behind gives le&s;s pain to the
Criminal than that before. Whil&s;t we &s;ojourn|ed
in this Town we received many civilities from
<HI>Dom Pedro Miranda,</HI> born at <HI>Oleron</HI> in <HI>Bearn,</HI>
and one of the riche&s;t Bankers of this Town.
We had Letters of credit to him, of which
though we made no u&s;e, he did us all manner of
good offices, every day &s;ending us his Coach,
and &s;ometimes accompanying us to what was
mo&s;t remarkable. The Buildings here are large
and high, and generally fairer than in <HI>Madrid:</HI>
there is one long and broad Street where the
<PB N="211" REF="110">
<HI>Tour</HI> is made as at <HI>Madrid</HI> in the <HI>Calle Major.</HI>
The mo&s;t con&s;iderable hou&s;e belongs to the
Duke of <HI>Villa Hermo&s;a,</HI> who pretends to de&s;cend
from the ancient Kings of <HI>Arragon,</HI> and thinks
they which enjoy the Crown do him wrong.</P>
<P>To &s;peak generally of the humor of the Peo|ple
of <HI>Arragon,</HI> they are no le&s;s proud than the
<HI>Ca&s;tilians,</HI> and value them&s;elves above them
and all other of <HI>Spain;</HI> and it mu&s;t be
granted that they are equal to, and &s;ometimes
&s;urpa&s;s the mo&s;t of them in wit, whether applied
to good or evil. Their &s;oil is barren, and, ex|cepting
&s;ome Valleys and &s;uch parts to which
the waters of <HI>Ebro</HI> are conveyed by cut Chan|nels
to moi&s;ten it, all &s;and, heath and rock,
&s;o that it hardly affords corn to &s;u&s;tain its In|habitants.
Though &s;o little fertil in fruits it hath
ever produced gallant men, and from their fir&s;t
King to <HI>Ferdinand</HI> they reckon not one that

One day, he &s;aid, to revenge him&s;elf of
a Widow that had been &s;omething cruel to him,
and who, he yet knew, was not &s;o to every

well with her, and that was believed the con|&s;olation
of her Widowhood, to be watched:
As &s;oon as he knew he was in her hou&s;e, he
came, and with his Gards inve&s;ted it, command|ding
the door to be opened, for a &s;earch that
was important to the Kings &s;ervice: it was late
in the night, yet the Servants were &s;o much &s;ur|pri&s;ed,
that they let him in while&s;t the Monk was
with their Lady, without giving her any notice.
He tarried rallying with her all night, and about
8 in the morning cau&s;ed the reverend Frier to
be taken up behind a Trooper, a Trumpet going
before, which was to make a &s;tand at every turn|ing,
and after &s;ounding to point him out and
&s;ay: whoever &s;tand in need of a Frier to comfort
Widows at midnight, let them addre&s;s them&s;elves
to this Gallant, and they &s;hall be accommodated;
afterwards he &s;ent from Cloy&s;ter to Cloy&s;ter to
enquire which of them had lo&s;t a Frier, and when
di&s;covered, returned him to his Abbot, who
was to be intreated at his going to bed to take
with him the Key of that good fellows Cell, lea&s;t

he might wander another time. His other &s;to|ry
was, that three Curte&s;ans living at <HI>Naples</HI>
&s;o exce&s;&s;ively proud they hardly bowed
when they met him, he cau&s;ed them one day to
be invited to a Collation; they failed not to come
dre&s;t to all advantages, but with difference,
as well in that as in their beauties, though alike
proud; &s;o that they played the Queens with this
Viceroy, who received them very civily; but
perceiving they became nothing more humble,
be obliged them to undre&s;s them&s;elves on pre|tence

fair buildings, which makes us believe it is inha|bited
by &s;ome people of quality among&s;t the
exiles. At our going away the Guards pretend|ed
to &s;top us, but &s;eeing our Pa&s;sport dur&s;t not
per&s;i&s;t. We were told that the Cardinal <HI>de Rets,</HI>
after he had e&s;caped out of <HI>France,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing from
St. <HI>Seba&s;tians</HI> to the Kingdom of <HI>Valentia,</HI>
where he intended to embark for <HI>Italy,</HI> was
&s;tayed and very &s;treightly garded in this City.
He came in a Litter with a &s;mall Train, and
the Alcalde who was then walking on the Bridge,
&s;ent to demand who he was, but he unwilling
to be known, refu&s;ed to tell his name and quality,
upon which the Alcalde &s;et a Guard upon him
in the Inn where he alighted. This &s;urpri&s;ed
him, and he knew not what to think of &s;uch
u&s;age in a Countrey where he thought he had
&s;ecured the liberty lately recovered, and that he
&s;hould not have lo&s;t it as &s;oon as he began to
relli&s;h it: he therefore di&s;patched one of his
Servants to <HI>Pampeluna,</HI> with a letter of his arri|val
to the Viceroy, de&s;iring him to puni&s;h the
in&s;olence of that Judge, and deliver him out
of his hands: The Alcalde in the mean time
&s;ent to the Viceroy and Council of <HI>Navarre</HI> a
formal Narrative of what he had done, accord|ing
to the duty of his place, hoping &s;o to avoid
the blame might be laid upon him; for having
acted rather on account of humor and curio&s;ity,
then rea&s;on and judgment: then he had no other
advantage by his Letter, than the preventing the
Cardinals enlargement one day, becau&s;e the

Viceroy was obliged to a&s;&s;emble the Council of
<HI>Navarre,</HI> where the puni&s;hment of the Alcaldes
in&s;olence was re&s;olved on, and he turned out of
his place, and for &s;ome time bani&s;hed the Town,
where the Cardinal as &s;oon as known received
many civilities, and at his going away was at|tended
by the principal Inhabitants with all re|&s;pect
and honour. At that time came news that
the <HI>French</HI> had &s;tormed the lines, and beaten the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> from before <HI>Arras,</HI> but he maintained
&s;o effectually that this was impo&s;&s;ible, that he left
in all places where he came a contrary impre&s;&s;i|on,
which continues &s;till among&s;t tho&s;e people.
<HI>Pedro Miranda,</HI> or &s;ome that belonged to him,
being then at <HI>Tudela,</HI> &s;hewed him Letters of it
received from <HI>Paris,</HI> but he per&s;i&s;ted. One

the <HI>Spaniards</HI> by this flattery, not at all con|cerned

obtained him the better reception in his pa&s;&s;age,

<P>The 12th of <HI>July</HI> we dined at <HI>Laboro&s;&s;o,</HI> and
traver&s;ed <HI>Olitor,</HI> where the antient Kings of <HI>Na|varre</HI>
kept their Court and &s;omething of their
Palace &s;till remains, though the Town be now
a mi&s;erable Place, ruined by warrs between the
true Inheritors of the Crown, and &s;uch as inva|ded
them: we lay at <HI>Te&s;&s;alia,</HI> a good Town,
and its Territory more fertil than the re&s;t we
had pa&s;&s;ed. Next day we came to <HI>Pampeluna,</HI>
the capital City of that Kingdom, it &s;tands at
the end of a large Plain that &s;eems but barren;
<PB N="222" REF="116">
it is near the <HI>Pireneans,</HI> yet out of command of
any eminence. Its Citadel, &s;o famous in the
world, looks towards the Plain, and is on one
&s;ide environed by a great Marais. The Town is
not con&s;iderably fortified, and the ground it &s;tands
on hath many little ri&s;ings and de&s;cents &s;carcely
perceptible: there is a large Piazza where the
Bulls are fought. The people are clowni&s;h,
much addicted to &s;mall Traffick, which they free|ly
enough exerci&s;e with <HI>France,</HI> and as if there
were no war between the two Crowns: We ar|rived
at the end of a Fair, and met many French
Merchants: we tarried here three dayes as well
becau&s;e of the indi&s;po&s;ition of my Lord&mdash;
not well recovered of the Fevor he got at <HI>Sara|go&s;&s;a</HI>
as that one of our hor&s;es were lame. The
mean while we vi&s;ited the Earl of <HI>St. Stephen,</HI>
Viceroy and Captain General of this Kingdom&punc;
and delivered him the Letter we brought for
him; he is a little man very civil, and no le&s;s cu|rious
of all rarities. He received us well,
and ordered the Captain of his Guards to &s;hew
us the Citadel in the afternoon. Between the
Town and Citadel is a &s;pacious place &s;et with
trees for Walks: it hath five Ba&s;tions, and was
built by <HI>Philip</HI> the &s;econd with a great deal of
con&s;ideration, as a &s;trong Rampier again&s;t
<HI>France:</HI> the Ba&s;tions are covered with Stone,
the Grafts large, in mo&s;t parts of them water;
it hath no Outworks, neither doth it need any,
becau&s;e of the Marais on that &s;ide where it may
mo&s;t ea&s;ily be attacked: it &s;tands on a Rock, but
though the mo&s;t important place of the King|dom,
<PB N="223" REF="116">
and the only one that can hinder the
<HI>French</HI> from marching to <HI>Madrid,</HI> after they
have pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Pyreneans,</HI> it is not well looked
after. The works in many places want repara|tions,
and the Garri&s;on is very incon&s;iderable,
there being few Souldiers, for want of which
the Country people are to come in on the fir&s;t
&s;ummons: of whom they then had &s;ent for a
good number, and mixed them with the Soul|diers,
that we might not perceive that want:
but we could ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h, &s;o little had they
the meen of Sword-men, &s;ome of them not
wearing any, and parading with a Musket only,
or an old Pike, which they handled &s;o ill, it ap|peared
they were more accu&s;tomed to the Pitch|fork.
The Body of the place is well de&s;igned,
for in the middle of the Bracks where the Soul|diers
lodge, there is a great round place to draw
up in Battaglia, from whence by five broad &s;treets
they may march &s;treight to the five Ba&s;tions.</P>
<P>They &s;hewed us the Magazins not very well
furni&s;hed either with ammunition or victual, and
a very fair Towr built to keep powder, of which
it is altogether unprovided, and &s;erves for a pri|&s;on
for greate&s;t Criminals; they &s;hewed a very
fine Handmill for turning which they may al&s;o
make u&s;e of hor&s;es. It is the be&s;t Engin in its
kind that I have &s;een, it hath 4 or 5 Wheels and
as many Bins, in each of which they &s;aid they
could in one day grind 24 load of Corn: but this

and con&s;equently u&s;ele&s;e, and that unle&s;s
the Arti&s;t that made it la&s;ted as long as the Mill,
nothing ami&s;s in it could be amended, becau&s;e
I took it to be a particular invention, and that
none but him&s;elf knew the Fabrick, and all the
Springs, &s;o as to &s;et them right when broken;
but they replied they &s;ucce&s;&s;ivly kept one that
under&s;tood it, who, that they might never be de|&s;titute,
&s;till taught &s;ome Apprentice. Here are
two or three Ponds, as they &s;ay, derived from
Springs. There were not many Sentries on the
Rampart, nor at the Canon. It hath a particu|lar
Governor, that immediately depends on the
King: He was ab&s;ent, but we were very civily
received by his Lieutenant, who after he had
led us about the Walls gave us a Collation; his
frankne&s;s plea&s;ed us, and we perceived that as
by degrees we got farther from the Gravity of
<HI>Ca&s;tile,</HI> and &s;everity of <HI>Arragon,</HI> as little open
to one another as to Strangers, we approached
a more &s;ociable Country.</P>
<P>Nothing el&s;e being to be &s;een in the Ca&s;tle,
that we might not tre&s;pa&s;s on the Lieutenants
civility, nor tire that of the Viceroys Captain of
his Gard, we took leave of the fir&s;t, expre&s;&s;ing
our &s;atisfaction in his reception, and went
with the other to our Coach. Next day we
returned thanks to the Viceroy, and finding him
at lei&s;ure, had opportunity to di&s;cour&s;e with
him more particularly than at our fir&s;t vi&s;it. Be|ing
a knowing per&s;on, and one of the Councils
of State and Warre, he pre&s;ently fell upon the
<PB N="225" REF="117">
Government of the Low-Countries, making it
appear he under&s;tood tho&s;e affairs very well.
He told us afterwards that the Earl of <HI>Pigne|randa</HI>
was his near Kin&s;man, and we could do no
le&s;s than expre&s;s the e&s;teem we had for &s;o ac|compli&s;hed
a per&s;on one of the able&s;t Mini&s;ters
of <HI>Spain,</HI> and to whom we had e&s;pecially been
recommended; &s;o we took our leaves. The
15th in the Morning when we were about to take
hor&s;e, that we might get that night to the la&s;t
Village of the King of <HI>Spains</HI> Dominions in the
upper <HI>Navarre,</HI> a Servant of the Viceroys Cap|tain
of his Guards came to enquire, if his Ma|&s;ters
Gloves, which he thought he left in our
Chamber the day before, had been found: we
ordered &s;earch to be made every where, and &s;ent
him with my Lord&mdash;s <HI>valet de Chambre;</HI>
but having long looked for what had never been
lo&s;t he went away, and by his meen and com|portment
made us well enough comprehend, he
came not on that account, but to try, if we would
&s;end him &s;ome pairs of tho&s;e perfumed ones we
had in our Vali&s;es, and that were mentioned in
our Pa&s;&s;es: but none being deafer than they
which will not hear, we let him go, without
&s;eeming to under&s;tand him. But this &s;erved not
our turn; for thinking we were not ingenious
enough to do &s;o, he &s;ent back his man with a very
bad compliment, in plain terms to beg <HI>de los no|&s;tros
guantes de Ambar.</HI> We were amazed at this,
and our Vali&s;es being on the Hor&s;es, and our
&s;elves ready to mount, let him &s;ee how trouble|&s;ome
it would be to take them off, and open
<PB N="226" REF="118">
them, but that if he plea&s;ed we would write to
our Merchant in <HI>Madrid</HI> to &s;end him as many
pair as he de&s;ired. We thus freed our &s;elves
with all dexterity po&s;&s;ible, not thinking we had
done any thing contrary to civility, &s;ince he that
demands too boldly, and without con&s;ideration,
ought to take to him&s;elf the greate&s;t part of the
&s;hame of a refu&s;al Having thus got out of <HI>Pam|pelone,</HI>
we took the great Road of the <HI>Pyreneans</HI>
that leads to <HI>France.</HI> We were not far from the
Town ere we began to a&s;cend a hill, and before
we came to the next Village met &s;ome Souldiers
that belonged to the Garri&s;on of the Ca&s;tle,
who begged, which &s;urpri&s;ed me, for though the
King of <HI>Spain</HI> wants money, yet he never med|dles
with the forty thou&s;and Crowns they &s;ay the
Kingdom of <HI>Navarre</HI> brings up, and I have been
a&s;&s;ured that all that is levied, though it exceed
the &s;um I have &s;poken of, remains in the Coun|try
to pay the Viceroy, who hath a Salary of 10
thou&s;and Crowns (though he of <HI>Arragon</HI> hath
but &s;ix) for the entertainments of a Pre&s;ident and
&s;ix Coun&s;ellors, and maintaining his Forts and
Gari&s;ons.</P>
<P>They which know this kingdom, averr that
the King of <HI>Spain</HI> receives no advantage from
it, be&s;ides the &s;ecuring and extending his fron|tiers,
even to the Pyreneans, the true and na|tural
barricade God hath placed between <HI>France</HI>
and <HI>Spain:</HI> yet were the Taxes levied here as
in <HI>Ca&s;tille,</HI> he might draw &s;omething. But
the priviledges the people of <HI>Navarre</HI> re&s;er|ved
to them&s;elves, and the con&s;ideration that
<PB N="227" REF="118">
if they &s;hould rebel, they might po&s;&s;ibly re|turn
to the obedience of their natural Prince,
for whom yet they have inclinations,
&s;on is the rea&s;on they are not pre&s;&s;ed with
Taxes; &s;o that the certaine&s;t Leavies for &s;up|port
of the publick charge come from the Cu|&s;tome,
and are reported to be 24 thou&s;and
Crowns; but the avarice and deceit of tho&s;e
that finger the Money, rai&s;ed there for main|taining
the Gari&s;ons that ought to be better
paid then any others in <HI>Spain,</HI> reduce the poor
&s;oldiers to beggery, and cau&s;e the Kings &s;er|vice
to be &s;o much neglected, that were an
Army &s;ent thither, it would probably make ve|ry
great progre&s;&s;ion. It is true, that if we except
the inconveniences they would give the King
of <HI>Spain,</HI> there is not expectation enough of
advantages from that Quarter to cau&s;e the
be&s;t Troops to be &s;ent thither, which might
more profitably be imployed in <HI>Flanders, Mi|lan,</HI>
or <HI>Catalonia.</HI></P>
<P>Before our arrival at <HI>Burguette,</HI> we rather
baited then dined at a pitiful village, where
the Guardian looked on our Pa&s;&s;es with a great
deal of civility, and di&s;cour&s;ed with us of the
times in which he had &s;erved in <HI>Flanders</HI> un-Marquis
<HI>Spinola.</HI> Having traver&s;ed Woods, Hills,
and Valleys with &s;ometimes good &s;ometimes bad
way; we arrived in the evening at the Plain of
<HI>Roncevalles,</HI> famous for the great battle <HI>Charle|main,</HI>
fought, and lo&s;t in it, again&s;t the Sarazens.
My Lords&mdash;and&mdash;&s;purring on, got
to <HI>Burguette</HI> before it was dark: They had much
<PB N="228" REF="119">
ado to find lodging, and were fain to adre&s;s
them&s;elves to the Ju&s;tice, who ordered them
to be entertained in the hou&s;e where we pa&s;|&s;ed
the night. The next day being the 6th of
<HI>Iuly,</HI> without much &s;uffering by heat in &s;o wide
a Plain, encompa&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Pyreneans,</HI> we tra|ver&s;ed
it, and by &s;ome Merchants of <HI>Oleron</HI> that
often pa&s;s it, were &s;hewed the place where the
battle was fought; here &s;aid they <HI>Roland</HI> was
killed, notwith&s;tanding the force of his Lance;
where this Cro&s;s &s;tands, died the brave <HI>Renaldo,</HI>
and had we been curious of all that tradition,
true or fal&s;e, had taught them, I believe they
would have pointed out to us where every one
of the 12 Peers of <HI>France</HI> fell, and perhaps
have &s;hewed us &s;ome of their blood, for that
of <HI>Hero</HI>'s never peri&s;hes, and they went about
to per&s;wade us, that one place is &s;till Red with
it; but we, who&s;e curio&s;ity never went &s;o
low as to bu&s;ie it &s;elf about dumb objects, look|ed
on tho&s;e things only as we pa&s;&s;ed by, and
went not a &s;tep out of our way to ta&s;te the air
where they &s;aid &s;o great per&s;ons had rendred,
or vomited, the prodigious &s;ouls that ani|mated
bodies ranked among&s;t the antient Gi|ants.
Spurred on by impatience to be quickly
beyond the <HI>Pyreneans,</HI> we ha&s;ted over this Ro|mantick
or Hi&s;torical Valley; Coming to the
end of it, we found a Mountain, to whom it
gives the name of <HI>Roncevalles;</HI> we were told
this was the highe&s;t of the <HI>Pyreneans,</HI> yet there
was no &s;now on the top of it, though mo&s;t of
the other on our right hand had hoary heads;
<PB N="229" REF="119">
but notwith&s;tanding this, it &s;eemed to approach
nearer Heaven then tho&s;e that wore its Livery;
and that it changed colour betimes, and in the
beginning of the Summer, by rea&s;on of the &s;eas
neighbourhood; the acrimony of who&s;e vapors
aids to melt and di&s;&s;ipate its &s;now &s;ooner then
that of &s;uch as are more remote. When we
were at the heighth of the Mountain of <HI>Ron|cevalles,
Egregia contemplatione pavimus animum;</HI>
and we pau&s;ed to con&s;ider, on the one hand
<HI>Spain,</HI> that we had ju&s;t then abandoned, and on
the other <HI>France,</HI> which we were about to en|ter.
The fir&s;t &s;eemed a &s;corched Campania,
where the bald Mountains di&s;covered only na|ked
Rocks, and concealed few Plains or Vallies
that bore gra&s;s, or any thing el&s;e that is u&s;eful.
The later on the contrary pre&s;ented us a Gar|den,
where Nature had di&s;po&s;ed eminencies and
depre&s;&s;ions, Plains, Hills, Woods, and Valleys,
to boa&s;t variety on a fair Theater of univer&s;al
fertility, &s;o plentiully &s;owed, that the Land we
&s;aw, though none of the be&s;t of <HI>France,</HI> was
&s;urprizingly delightful, as &s;oon as compared
with that we had left. To conclude, without
hyperbole or exaggeration, and in a plain man|ner
of de&s;cribing things as they really are, I
mu&s;t declare, that contemplating two &s;o differ|ent
objects; me thought that in the one the day
of judgement would find little unburnt; and
that in the other&punc; the flames which &s;hall cele|brate
the worlds Funeral, would be la&s;t extin|gui&s;hed,
becau&s;e it &s;eemed the fire of Heaven
had already fallen on the fir&s;t, and almo&s;t ro&s;t|ed
<PB N="230" REF="120">
it; and that to the other, it had imparted
only a cheri&s;hing warmth to animate it: and
the <HI>Italian</HI> perhaps had rea&s;on, who vexed at
the Doctors that di&s;puted about the &s;eat of Pur|gatory,
&s;aid, he wondred men of learning
&s;hould be &s;o ignorant, for had they under&s;tood
Maps, they would have placed that of <HI>Europe</HI>
in <HI>Spain,</HI> and that of <HI>Africk</HI> in <HI>Lybia.</HI> I &s;hall
not determine whither he &s;poke &s;en&s;e, or raved,
but only add, that what I have &s;aid of the dif|ference
of the&s;e two pro&s;pects; takes not off
my e&s;teem for <HI>Spain,</HI> nor hinders my admi|ring
the wi&s;dom, temperance, prudence, and o|ther
moral and political virtues, that are emi|nent
in the greate&s;t part of the men it produ|ces:
it is not therefore out of contempt of the
one, or too elevated an <HI>Idea</HI> of the other,
that I regi&s;ter the difference I ob&s;erved: I know
very well that the fatte&s;t &s;oils are not ever mo&s;t
beneficial, neither do they always produce the
greate&s;t per&s;onages. The able&s;t of all the Gre|cians
was born among&s;t the rocks of <HI>Ithaca;</HI>
and in <HI>Provence</HI> there is a certain nook, called
<HI>la Crau,</HI> covered with Flint, whith its Lord will
not exchange for any other that abounds with
Fruits and Flowers, becau&s;e in that very &s;eat
of barrenne&s;s there grows an herb of &s;uch vir|tue,
that one twig of it is worth many handfuls
of tho&s;e of the mo&s;t luxurious meddows; this
makes appear, that fruits of perfecte&s;t &s;avor
often abound in the defectiv'&s;t foils, and that
though <HI>Spain</HI> be lean and dry, &s;he is yet &s;trong
and vigorous: and experience teaches, that the
<PB N="231" REF="120">
Spaniards are &s;touter and more capable of great
fatique, then &s;uch as are born in more plea&s;ant
and plentiful Countreys, and even among&s;t
them&s;elves, the mo&s;t couragious Races flouri&s;h
among&s;t Rocks and Mountains, and in the &s;andie&s;t
Provinces; the other being inhabited by per|&s;ons
neither of &s;o warlike &s;pirits, nor elevated
fancies, pu&s;illanimity being almo&s;t always the
companion of fertility; and the Romans were
&s;carce ever more put to it, then in the conque&s;t
of this nation; its invincible courage, the dif|ficulty
of pa&s;&s;age, &s;car&s;ity of Provi&s;ions, and ex|ce&s;s
of heat, predominating, almo&s;t through the
whole penin&s;ula, re&s;i&s;ted them Six&s;core years;
neither could it in le&s;s time be overcome in our
age, were it &s;till as populous as formerly.</P>
<P>But ere I give over, and that I may do <HI>Spain</HI>
right before I loo&s;e the &s;ight of it; I mu&s;t ob|&s;erve
that this &s;terility and penury objected a|gain&s;t
it, is not cau&s;ed &s;o much by the default
(if I may &s;o &s;peak) of the Countrey, as by that
of its inhabitants; were they more indu&s;trious,
and in&s;tead of feeding them&s;elves with &s;moak
and vanity in their wretched Cabins, tilled bet|ter
their Land, and contemned not mechanick
Arts, &s;he would be a liberal mother of all things
nece&s;&s;ary for life, whither to cloath or feed them,
and they might have Corn, Wine, Oyl, and
all manner of fruits, to &s;uffice them, without
being beholding to their neighbors; and did
they under&s;tand Husbandry, or would apply
them&s;elves to it, it would maintain them in
&s;uch abundance, that not only the more fertile
<PB N="232" REF="121">
Provinces would &s;upply the &s;terility of &s;ome that
are barrener, but they might vent part to for|rainers,
wools of <HI>Segovia,</HI> Silks of <HI>Grenada,</HI> Cor|dovans
of <HI>Ciudad Rodrigo;</HI> the Flax and Hemp
of <HI>Andalu&s;ia;</HI> the Iron and Copper of <HI>Bi&s;cai,</HI>
with many other rich di&s;poils of its Cattle, Land,
and Mines, might croud its Cities with Artifi|cers,
and fill them with the be&s;t manufactures of
<HI>Europe;</HI> but they &s;end the&s;e abroad unwrought,
which when Forrainers have metamorpho&s;ed
and di&s;po&s;ed to humane u&s;e, part return to them
from tho&s;e who double the money they fir&s;t
paid for them.</P>
<P>I have now pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Pyreneans,</HI> and top of
the high mountain that &s;eparates <HI>France</HI> from
<HI>Spain,</HI> and whil&s;t I contemplated tho&s;e two
great Kingdoms, having ventured to compare
their Climates, and contract as in one ma&s;s all
the remarks of my journey; I will conclude by
&s;etting again&s;t each other the cu&s;toms and po|liticks
of this neighbouring people; no le&s;s con|trary
then the motions that cau&s;e fire to mount
and earth to de&s;cend. Whil&s;t I &s;tayed at <HI>Madrid</HI>
I u&s;ed my utmo&s;t endeavor to di&s;cover; if the
antipathy reported to be &s;o natural and recipro|cal,
were really and &s;ub&s;tantially as &s;trong as
it &s;eems, and is imagined; but I found that the
contrariety attributed to their humors, and com|portment,
whither publick or private, proceeds
rather from &s;everal tempers and Genius's, then
any true and real antipathy that renders the
French more incompatible with Spaniards, then
with Engli&s;hmen, Germans, Italians, or any o|ther
<PB N="233" REF="121">
nations every one of which hath its parti|cular
character and &s;pecifick impre&s;&s;ion, as well
in body as mind, which may (if I be permitted
the expre&s;&s;ion) be called its principle of di&s;tin|ction.
If be&s;ides this common and general vari|ety,
proceeding from the Air we fir&s;t breath,
there be any more expre&s;s and formal between
one people and another; it is cau&s;ed by &s;ome
accidents, conjunctures or other circum&s;tances,
which as to contempt and hatred have the &s;ame
influence on nations as on particular per&s;ons,
who (that excepted) have no more of contrari|ety
then two Rivers that run different cour&s;es,
and ever follow their Channel with equal in|clination,
though not always with the &s;ame im|petuo&s;ity.
This granted, I averre, that be&s;ides
competition of power and State of Rival&s;hip, in
which the&s;e people have &s;o long continued, and
which have been animated by many wars and
differences not yet reconciled or ended, no an|tipathy
can be ob&s;erved between them, more
then each of them hath with all others: and
when the&s;e con&s;iderations have bern removed,
and the cau&s;es of aver&s;ion of State for State, and
publick animo&s;ities have cea&s;ed they have lived
as well one with another, as either of them hath
done with other forrainers. My &s;elf have &s;een
very many French inhabiting <HI>Madrid,</HI> and <HI>Sa|rago&s;&s;a,</HI>
who not concerning them&s;elves in the
intere&s;t of their Countrey, agree very well with
the Spaniards; and the Catalonians and Portu|gue&s;es
give convincing te&s;timonies of this ve|rity&punc;
All the world knows that the&s;e renoun|cing
<PB N="234" REF="122">
the Catholick Kings Dominion, and abju|ring,
with the fealty they owed him, all the mi|&s;teries
of the Spani&s;h Monarchy, there followed
&s;o great confidence and corre&s;pondence between
them and <HI>France,</HI> that notwith&s;tanding diffe|rence
of humors, they have reciprocally been as
well received and looked upon at <HI>Paris</HI> and
<HI>Lisbon</HI> as they could be at <HI>Stockholme</HI> or <HI>War|&s;ovia,</HI>
where I &s;uppo&s;e no man will imagin any
antipathy for either of them: the former of
the&s;e wheeled a little more, and ca&s;t them&s;elves
into the arms of <HI>France,</HI> the difference of cu|&s;tomes
and inclinations not preventing their
corre&s;ponding as well as <HI>Spaniards, Neapolitans</HI>
and <HI>Flemings.</HI> It is only &s;ince that emulation of
glory, which beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">n with the advancement of
the Spani&s;h Empire under <HI>Ferdinand,</HI> increa&s;ed
under the <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, and continued un|der
his Succe&s;&s;ors, that the&s;e people cannot
brook one another either in publick or particu|lar,
and that have added to the difference of
their tempers and natures, a &s;pirit of envy, ha|tred,
and contempt, which make them incom|patible.
For one of them is not only re&s;erved
and &s;peculative, but impatient of the gay and
&s;ociable humor of the other; one of them is
not only &s;low and dilatory, but cannot &s;uffer the
others activity and brisk temper; one of them
is not only &s;atisfied to walk as if he counted his
&s;teps, but cannot abide the others negligent and
interrupted gate: one of them does not only
&s;alute by leaning backwards, but &s;coffs at the o|ther
when he bows to do it. In a word one of
<PB N="235" REF="122">
them hath neither humor nor cu&s;tom that di&s;|plea&s;es
not the other, and which he blames not
out of the principles of jealou&s;ie and ambition I
have formerly mentioned.</P>
<P>The&s;e different qualities cau&s;ed and height|ened
by that emulation of grandeur, and thir&s;t
of precedence, that hath &s;o long tormented them,
and co&s;t Chri&s;tendom &s;o much blood, are the
&s;our&s;es of the diver&s;ity of their Politicks. Not|with&s;tanding
all which one of them &s;ometimes
borrows &s;omething of the nature and qualities
of the other, and imitates &s;ome of its mo&s;t &s;ub|til
tracings; but the hand and pencil ever differ:
neither is it po&s;&s;ible &s;o to &s;ettle other mens
clothes on our own backs, that it will not be di&s;|covered
they were not made for us. There is
ever &s;omething in their manner of acting, which
makes apparent its principles are no more the
&s;ame then its agents. They which have read
the famous conte&s;t between Pope <HI>Paul</HI> the fifth
and the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and ob&s;erved the forms and
ends of tho&s;e great Potentates, for glory and
intere&s;t, may find a manife&s;t proof of this verity.
It is mo&s;t certain that in their Politicks they
now and then tread in one anothers foot&s;teps;
but it is more &s;o, that their pace is never equal
which way &s;oever they go. <HI>Spain</HI> is repre&s;ent|ed
in a Chariot, &s;eated on a Throne of Tortois-&s;hell,
drawn by Remora's, who in tedious tra|ver&s;ing
va&s;t &s;paces of time, lo&s;e many opportu|nities:
yet her extraordinary patience and clo&s;e
application to the game, with her skill in pack|ing
the Cards, oftentimes di&s;turbs the de&s;ignes of
<PB N="236" REF="123">
the craftie&s;t Game&s;ters. When at more violent
exerci&s;es &s;he never &s;tumbles by too much ha&s;te,
&s;he waits the rebound of the ball, and if &s;he
mi&s;&s;es it, is &s;atisfied to have judged it well, and
not to have lo&s;t her &s;troke by precipitation, and
giving it before it came to ground. By a va&s;t
&s;peculation &s;he embraces the whole extent of
an object, di&s;covers the mo&s;t minute parts of it,
all its joynts and mu&s;cles; and if &s;he makes not
her &s;elf Mi&s;tre&s;s of it, it is never becau&s;e &s;he
mi&s;took the mo&s;t advantageous part of lay hold
on, but becau&s;e too intent in &s;tudying the hour
and moment, which either pa&s;&s;es over, or is
&s;natched away whil&s;t &s;he waits for it, or delibe|rates
on it.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged that this misfortune
doth not often happen to her in her Council-Chamber,
nor in &s;uch affairs as depend on ne|gotiations
only. Of all parts of the art of go|verning
&s;he &s;ucceeds be&s;t in this, where her con|&s;iderations
fixed on all circum&s;tances are very
happy, here &s;he makes appear the ingenious
Fabrick of tho&s;e artificial Springs which give
motion to a &s;low and circum&s;pect proceeding,
that &s;ecures her of a good effect in what ever
&s;he hath lei&s;ure and time to manage. But in the
field, and affairs of warre, where &s;he hath nei|ther
time nor liberty to comply with a long and
mature deliberation, &s;uch occa&s;ions as can|not
ea&s;ily &s;uffer this, and where oppor|tunity
mu&s;t be anticipated, and more u&s;ually
left to hazard and fortune, than to prudence and
rea&s;on, &s;he hath not the like advantage, and of|ten
<PB N="237" REF="123">
comes &s;o &s;hort in her reckoning, that &s;he
&s;ees her mo&s;t important de&s;ignes peri&s;h becau&s;e
begun too late, and her &s;elf deceived in the hour
&s;he de&s;tined for their bringing forth. I will
not be bu&s;ie about examples of this truth; for,
be&s;ides the Siege of <HI>Ma&s;tricht,</HI> (the opportuni|ty
of rai&s;ing which &s;he lo&s;t by delaying to un|dertake
it as &s;oon as it was begun, and where
&s;he pretended &s;o much to force and Council, that
&s;he at la&s;t employed neither the one nor the o|ther,
but in order to receiving a more publick
affront) the late warrs might furni&s;h us te&s;timo|nies
&s;o well known to all the world, that it were
to no purpo&s;e to in&s;ert them here.</P>
<P>But I will add that this gravity, and two great
circum&s;pection, which &s;ometimes makes the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> fall by endeavouring to fix their feet
more &s;teadily, is in a manner recompen&s;ed by a
very con&s;iderable quality, which is an extraor|dinary
con&s;tancy after misfortunes that have
been almo&s;t de&s;tructive to her, and an ince&s;&s;ant
per&s;everance with indefatigable vigor to pur&s;ue
all advantages after good &s;ucce&s;s. If we con&s;ider
the rude trials of this to which &s;he hath been
expo&s;ed by in&s;urrections of &s;o many people, re|volt
of one of her riche&s;t Provinces, and &s;epara|tion
of a Kingdom; if we ob&s;erve the great
&s;hocks &s;he hath received both by land and &s;ea,
from the Armies of &s;o many Princes allied a|gain&s;t
her, and examine the many Battails &s;he
hath lo&s;t, we &s;hall find cau&s;e enough of admira|tion
that &s;he is &s;till on her feet, and that it is a
grandeur altogether peculiar to that Nation, to
<PB N="238" REF="124">
endure, &s;o much without fainting, and that no
other &s;tomach could dige&s;t &s;o many hard mor|&s;el
without lo&s;s of appetite: that any thing of
which remains is alone to be imputed to that
gentle and natural heat which acts without pre|cipitation,
and &s;uffers without alteration what
it can neither concoct nor evacuate, ca&s;ting it
on time and a more favourable conjuncture:
I mean that her policies are &s;o pliable and con|&s;tant,
that if her expedients and power often
fail, her heart never does &s;o, though contem|plating
her condition, &s;he hath nothing many
times to comfort her, but patience, and &s;uch o|ther
vertues as &s;he ever makes u&s;e of both in
Field and Cabinet, how low &s;oever. Neither
hath &s;he been wont to give ove a lo&s;er, how
unfortunate &s;oever, &s;eldom abandoning the gave
and hope of revenge. Though &s;he lately con|&s;ented
to the liberty of the United Provinces,
and renounced her right to di&s;pute it, it was not
till after a war of four&s;core years, nor without
that ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity which obliges of two evils
to choo&s;e the lea&s;t, &s;o that we cannot inferre
from it &s;he was &s;ick at heart, nor that &s;he often
regorges what &s;he hath once &s;wallowed. And
perhaps if &s;he ever di&s;engages her &s;elf from the
many tyes that re&s;train her, and gets lei&s;ure to
make a free u&s;e of her power and wi&s;dom, it will
appear &s;he laied not a&s;ide the Cards, but becau&s;e
&s;he had too many Game&s;ters upon her hand, and
that &s;he will rea&s;&s;ume them with this prote&s;tati|on,
that there is no pre&s;cription to Soveraigns;
and that the &s;olemne&s;t Othes, if contrary to
<PB N="239" REF="124">
tho&s;e of their Coronation oblige them not, and
that there may as well happen to them as to the
hone&s;t Ca&s;ui&s;t, a certain apprehen&s;ion that may
di&s;pen&s;e with their making good their pro|mi&s;e.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider on the other &s;ide (to return to
what I have &s;aid of the equality of their vigour
in pro&s;perity) how we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> under|&s;tand
to make u&s;e of the favours of fortune, and
all their advantages, when heaven hath compli|ed
with that circum&s;pection and remote fore|&s;ight
according to which they act, we mu&s;t needs
acknowledge all other policies come &s;hort of
theirs, being bolde&s;t, active&s;t, and mo&s;t vigilant
after good &s;ucce&s;s, that be&s;t pur&s;ue the gain of
a battail, and carefulle&s;t &s;ecure a Town after its
&s;urrender, that mo&s;t aptly impo&s;e fetters on Peo|ple
they have conquered, or reduced to their
ancient &s;ubjection, if &s;traied from it; and that bet|ter
than any other accommodate to their own
intere&s;ts, tho&s;e of the Princes allied with them;
(in a word) that after victory are more &s;olicitous
to gather all the fruits that can be derived from
it, and draw all the good con&s;equences it can
po&s;&s;ibly afford. Others in pro&s;perity langui&s;h,
and their indu&s;try &s;tackens after conque&s;t, chu|&s;ing
rather to enjoy the fruits of their good for|tune,
than to make an advantageous u&s;e of it,
and to lo&s;e the honor and profit of their great|e&s;t
actions, then not to repo&s;e and take breath
at the end of the cour&s;e. Such politicks belong
only to tho&s;e that have better arms then heads,
and that value not the Pri&s;e &s;o much as the
<PB N="240" REF="125">
Race, nor Crowns and Triumphs as Battails and
Victories; I mean that preferre the way before
the end, and great actions above the felicities
they lead to.</P>
<P>To the two high advantages I have mention|ed
of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Politicks, derived from the
great circum&s;pection that attends them, a third
may be added, which is that when&s;oever they
have any de&s;ign in hand, they can &s;o &s;ecretly
give it maturity, that nothing is di&s;covered of it
till at once it &s;urpri&s;es and a&s;honi&s;hes. They
work under ground, and with much care that
nothing of their de&s;ign takes vent, lea&s;t which
may be di&s;covered by their meen &amp; countenance
they counterfeit &s;leep when mo&s;t awake, at Sen|try,
and ready to di&s;charge, and (though at other
times very jealous of reputation) are not then
di&s;plea&s;ed to have their power decried, nor to
be accu&s;ed of weakne&s;s, that &s;uch erroneous
judgment may cau&s;e their enemies &s;o much to
neglect &s;tanding on their Gard, they may take
them unprovided and overthrow tho&s;e that think
them to be in a condition neither to attacque, nor
defend them&s;elves. Shadowed by &s;uch &s;ecre&s;ie,
and &s;ecured by &s;uch artifice, they have &s;ome|times
very &s;odainly advanced, and pa&s;&s;ing by
the conque&s;t of all <HI>Sicilia,</HI> it is known that in
our daies they have &s;ucce&s;sfully done this, and
when lea&s;t apprehended appeared before <HI>Tarra|gon</HI>
and <HI>Lerida</HI> with more forces then they were
thought to be Ma&s;ters of. In a word they have
ever been &s;ecret to admiration and &s;o excellent|ly
practi&s;ed in that politick di&s;&s;imulation, &s;o u&s;e|full
<PB N="241" REF="125">
in governing, and that can &s;o well aid it
&s;elf with di&s;gui&s;e, that they have often by it ob|tained
&s;uch effects, as by force they could never
have arrived at. And when the&s;e little Max|ims
fail of &s;ucce&s;s in warr, they have recour&s;e
to Treaties and Conferences, where they &s;o
dexterou&s;ly make u&s;e of them, that in one ma|ner
or other they gain all advantages can be ex|pected
from them. On account of which I mu&s;t
needs take notice, that they obtain the better
in Negotiations, by means alone of that flegma|tick
and extraordinary patience, that tires and
quenches the heat of other people, leading
them about through &s;o many labyrinths, that at
la&s;t weary of conferring &s;o long, and concluding
nothing, they comply with part of what is de|&s;ired,
and perhaps in conclu&s;ion yield to the re&s;t,
&s;o to purcha&s;e that repo&s;e <HI>Spain</HI> &s;eems &s;o un|willing
to grant them, becau&s;e &s;en&s;ible of their
weakne&s;s, and that they pur&s;ue with impatience
what&s;oever they have once hoped for.</P>
<P>Thus by a judicious ob&s;tinacy they oftentimes
overcome the greate&s;t oppo&s;ition again&s;t what
they de&s;ign, and by compliance po&s;&s;e&s;s them|&s;elves
of what they cannot obtain by conte&s;ta|tion.</P>
<P>But to &s;tay no longer on con&s;ideration of Po|licies
that have within them&s;elves turnings and
windings very particular, I will only add that it
is conceived &s;omething might be amended in
their Catholicon, I mean in that exce&s;s of zeal,
real or pretended, they make appear in matters
of Religion. It is very evident that this fire
<PB N="242" REF="126">
&s;ometimes warms <HI>Spain</HI> to its prejudice, and may
&s;ooner con&s;ume her, than convince tho&s;e &s;he
would by it win to her intere&s;ts: And no le&s;s
known that the Popes are not kinder to her on
this account, but &s;u&s;pect her pa&s;&s;ion for the
Church of an humane infirmity, that &s;tretches
toward heaven only to grow higher upon earth:
and that &s;he gains no friends intirely, but a
&s;hare only of their inclinations, by tho&s;e wayes
that make her real enemies, that have a perfect
hatred and aver&s;ion for her. In a word her con|&s;tant
de&s;igne, and to which &s;he &s;eems engaged
as by oath not to &s;uffer Prote&s;tants in her Do|minions,
and to per&s;ecute them in their own, is
a &s;tate &s;ecret that hath been &s;o well examined
by Catholicks, that its true price and value is
&s;ufficiently under&s;tood by them, and no le&s;s by
tho&s;e again&s;t whom it is directed, which cau&s;es
them to apprehend, that on &s;uch &s;pecious
principles, &s;he engages to their ruine, to &s;atisfie
her ambition, and that high aim of which &s;he
is accu&s;ed, by uniting in one body &s;o many dif|ferent
Dominions, to become head of Chri&s;ten|dom.
In the mean time the pre&s;ent compo&s;ure
of <HI>Europe,</HI> and form of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of
Chri&s;tianity con&s;idered, &s;he ought to ca&s;t off this
thought, and recollect that the two parties into
which it is divided, are almo&s;t equal, and if they
&s;hould come to a &s;hock with the Body of their
Forces, victory would a long time hover incer|tain
which &s;ide to take, and perhaps not hers,
though &s;econded by all the Roman Legions.
She ought to under&s;tand her <HI>Catholicon</HI> to be but
<PB N="243" REF="126">
a thin vi&s;ard to her <HI>Ragione di &s;tato</HI> that it hath
often di&s;covered the &s;ecret, which hath been
known every where; and to examine how &s;mall
the advantages are of following Maxims that ex|a&s;perate
one party, and gain not the other. My
meaning, is &s;he &s;hould confine her &s;elf within the
limits of temporal intere&s;t, without mixing Re|ligion
with it, which de&s;cended not from heaven
to de&s;troy Society, and that it will nothing avail
her to make &s;o many &s;ignes of the cro&s;s, again&s;t
Prote&s;tants. Let her therefore permit them to
live, and living with them make them under|&s;tand,
&s;he hath ab&s;olved her &s;elf from that vow
(at lea&s;t if there were any &s;uch) which obliged
her on all occa&s;ions to endeavour their de&s;tru|ction
and that of their Church. From &s;uch a
change of conduct &s;he would derive two great
advantages, for &s;he would be more con&s;iderable
at <HI>Rome</HI> by &s;eeming le&s;s attached to the intere&s;ts
of that Court, and more redoubted by <HI>France,</HI>
by diverting part of the inclination of tho&s;e of
the Reformed Religion, which it believes it &s;elf
alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, with exclu&s;ion of all other Ca|tholick
Princes, never giving te&s;timonies of open
hatred, nor per&s;ecuting with fire and fagot, that
which ought to be the object only of prayer and
per&s;wa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Having drawn &s;ome lines of the nature and
qualities of the Spani&s;h policies, it remains that I
give &s;uch a draught of tho&s;e of the French, as
may di&s;cover part of their extent and Forces, that
by comparing them we may judge which is like|ly
to get the better of its rival: The later are
<PB N="244" REF="127">
&s;o variable, and of a form &s;o tran&s;ient, that
hours and moments, which ever fly, have no
&s;wifter revolution; and the former are as con|trary,
and appropriated to fixation; it is very
difficult to paint the one becau&s;e of the rapidity
of its cour&s;e, and no le&s;s &s;o to determine which
of the two is more potent, by rea&s;on of the
continual conflict they have &s;o long &s;trugled in,
without yielding on either &s;ide. One would
think they had divided between them all the
skill of the Fencing-&s;chool, and that the one
comes on with better grace, and hath its arm
more &s;upple, but that the other reaches farther,
and makes its thru&s;t more home: Thus Heaven
to pre&s;erve the power of the&s;e Nations near an
equality, hath oppo&s;ed to the vivacity and &s;pirit
of one of them the prudence and con&s;tancy of
the other, that what the la&s;t comes &s;hort in a|gility,
may be recompen&s;ed by its attention to
all it undertakes; and what the fir&s;t wants of
circum&s;pection and patience may be &s;upplied by
incredible diligence.</P>
<P>It is yet probable that the <HI>French</HI> fire &s;o allay|ed,
as not to da&s;le the judgment, produces grea|ter
effects than the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">eam, how con&s;ide|rable
&s;oever. It is capable of all that is Heroick
even to miracle, it forces an alteration in the
face of affairs, and chains fortune and victory to
attend its banners; when they &s;eem inclining to
for&s;ake it. It is as quick in di&s;covering and pre|venting
mi&s;chiefs as in applying remedies to
tho&s;e that &s;urpri&s;e it. Its eye, hand, and heart
are continually directed to what may help or
<PB N="245" REF="127">
hurt it; the fir&s;t is u&s;efull to embrace or avoid,
the &s;econd to &s;ei&s;e whatever is advantagious, and
repel all that may be fatal, whil&s;t the la&s;t ani|mates
to &s;upport all burthens, and often attains
what its &s;trength could not extend to, whil&s;t
with all three it on one &s;ide levels a way for mi&s;|fortune,
and bani&s;hes it, and on the other opens
a door to &s;ucce&s;s and meets it: Whereas the
profound intellect of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> by means of
fro&s;ty irre&s;olution and tedious deliberation, &s;uf|fers
the fruits of its be&s;t Enterpri&s;es to be nipt in
the blo&s;&s;om, becau&s;e not &s;o diligent to execute
as &s;ubtle to invent them. I could draw examples
from our pre&s;ent times conclu&s;ive enough of this
truth, if I were not de&s;irous to make an end. I
will therefore only add that that I am not un|&s;en&s;ible,
that the <HI>French</HI> airine&s;s often cau&s;es
their de&s;ignes to mi&s;carry, that their diligence
is not alwayes joyned with prudence, and that
it &s;ometimes ha&s;tens with &s;o little di&s;cour&s;e and
reflexion, it ob&s;erves nothing, and as if it had
no other members but hands and feet, violently
plunges into confu&s;ion, and falls headlong into
misfortune, by rea&s;on of that precipitation which
often a&s;toni&s;hes, and puts it be&s;ides it &s;elf, &s;o
much that its great courage abandoning it, it
retreats in di&s;order. The reproach of this is ne|verthele&s;s
much out of date, by rea&s;on of ma|ny
modern great and couragious actions and en|terpri&s;es,
where it hath made appear a diligence
in executions, as little de&s;titute of judgement
as courage.</P>
<P>This was long ago, when experience had not
<PB N="246" REF="128">
purified their fire, nor moderated that exce&s;s
of it which made them begin well and end ill,
on which account all they did was attributed to
furie and a blind tran&s;port, that after the fir&s;t
attempt was changed into fear: but they are
no more the &s;ame men, neither, after going on
like Lions, do they come off like Hares; and
when their enterpri&s;es fail of &s;ucce&s;s, they ma|ny
times retreat with honor, and without con|fu&s;ion.
And certainly the greate&s;t promptitude
when accompanied by rea&s;on and judgement is
as often the Mother as Stepdame of good for|tune.
<HI>Alexander</HI> conquered all becau&s;e he would
leave nothing for the morrow; and <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> al|lowed
but a moment between deliberation and
action, apprehending that either the greatne&s;s
of the de&s;ign might di&s;courage it, or the oppor|tunity
be pa&s;&s;ed if he took time to examine it:
but as the celerity of the&s;e two Heroes was ever
fortunate, by rea&s;on of their prodigious Capa|cities
in all they undertook, and the circum&s;pe|ction
and delays of <HI>Fabius Maximus</HI> and the
great <HI>Gon&s;alvo</HI> re-e&s;tabli&s;hed Empire, and con|quered
Kingdoms, we may &s;ay that each of the&s;e
Nations, according as their predominant humor
is allaied by prudence, and illuminated by rea|&s;on,
can di&s;ge&s;t the toughe&s;t mor&s;els, and diffi|culte&s;t
thwartings of fortune, though one of
them hath defects of &s;tomach, that &s;ometimes
cau&s;e vomitings, and the other is now and then
afflicted with megrims that oblige it to repo&s;e.
<HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> had felt the pul&s;e of both of them
when he pronounced his <HI>Fe&s;tina lente:</HI> and we
<PB N="247" REF="128">
may infallibly conclude that a third Con&s;tituti|on
participating of the <HI>French</HI> promptitude and
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> &s;olidity, were alone capable not only
of conquering the World but governing it. And
a great and wi&s;e Frenchman having owned
<HI>l intere&s;t d' Angleterre e&s;tant bien &s;uivi e&s;tablira
dans la Chretient&egrave; vne troi&s;iem pui&s;&s;ance:</HI> that
<HI>England</HI> pur&s;uing her true intere&s;t will become
a third Power, equal to <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain</HI> (and
this meant in regard of her &s;cituation &amp; &s;trength
alone) I think I may mode&s;tly enough add, that
the equality and harmony of her temper (which
neither heavily &s;lumbers away opportunities,
nor ra&s;hly &s;natches at them before maturity)
con&s;idered, did not &s;ome mi&s;taken principles,
introduced by a fond doting on &s;uch a liberty as
is incon&s;i&s;tent with Government, make the &s;ub|ordinate
wheels too heavy, and the Spring (that
is the &s;upreme power) too weak to produce re|gular
and vigorous motions in them, by a per|fect
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to her Soveraign, &s;he might un|der
his conduct be able to make a farther progre&s;|&s;ion
towards giving laws to mankind than any
other people ever arrived at.</P>
