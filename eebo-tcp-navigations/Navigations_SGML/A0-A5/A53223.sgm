<P><HI>_ASIA,</HI> by &s;ome call'd <HI>Semia,</HI> from <HI>Sem</HI> the elde&s;t Son of <HI>Noah,</HI> to who&s;e Lot it fell; and now by Naviga|tors, <HI>The Levant,</HI> from the <HI>Italian</HI> Word <HI>Levante,</HI> i. e. <HI>The Ea&s;t,</HI> from its Ea&s;terly Situa|tion; hath been generally accounted, by Ancient Writers, the bigge&s;t of the Three formerly Known Divi&s;ions of the WORLD, and by &s;ome e&s;timated equal to the other Two, <HI>EUROPE</HI> and <HI>AFRI|CA;</HI> and is moreover Ennobled with &s;everal grand Prerogatives above the re&s;t: For here that Glorious Work of Creation fir&s;t manife&s;ted it &s;elf, and terminated in that greate&s;t of God's Handy-works, the Formation of Man: Here flouri&s;h'd the Terre&s;trial Paradi&s;e, or Garden of <HI>Eden,</HI> which our fir&s;t Parents Inhabited, Culti|vated, and in the end, by their Di&s;obedience, lo&s;t. And as the Creation, &s;o al&s;o the Redem|ption of Man-kind was here wrought, by our Ble&s;&s;ed Saviour's Incarnation, Nativity, Preach|ing, Miracles, and la&s;tly, Suffering upon the Cro&s;s, and Re&s;urrection: And here the Divine Monument of his Pa&s;&s;ion, the Holy Sepulchre, is yet pre&s;erv'd, by God's Providence, even un|der the Guardian&s;hip of <HI>Infidels</HI> them&s;elves. From hence, as from the Fountain of Plantation, and fir&s;t Inhabited Part of the World, <HI>Colonies</HI> were &s;ent forth into all Parts, and the whole Globe of Earth was &s;upply'd with People. Here was the fir&s;t Foundation of Cities, In&s;titution of Laws and Government, Civili&s;ing of Manners, Ori|ginal of Arts and Sciences, and the Communica|tion of all Literature, both Divine and Humane, to the re&s;t of the World. And as the two fir&s;t Great and Famous Empires of the World, the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian,</HI> were here Founded, and &s;uc|ceeded each other, continuing for the &s;pace of 1368 Years, namely, from the Year of the World 2000, to the Year 3368; &s;o at this day the greate&s;t Empires of the Univer&s;e are con|tain'd in this Part thereof; as namely, the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire, which though it extend it &s;elf into <HI>Europe,</HI> yet the greate&s;t part of it is contain'd within the Verge of <HI>A&s;ia;</HI> that of the <HI>Sophi</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> that of the Emperor of <HI>China;</HI> that of the <HI>Great Cham</HI> of <HI>Tartary;</HI> which two la&s;t Em|pires are now by Conque&s;t united under one Head, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Great Chan:</HI> and that of the <HI>Great Mogol.</HI></P>
<P>Of the Seven Wonders of the World, Four were in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> namely, The Temple of <HI>Diana,</HI> at <HI>Ephe&s;us;</HI> The <HI>Mau&s;oleum,</HI> or Sepulchre of <HI>Mau&s;o|lus,</HI> at <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;us;</HI> The Walls of <HI>Babylon;</HI> and the <HI>Colo&s;&s;us,</HI> or Statue of the Sun, at <HI>Rhodes.</HI> Of the other three, one is in <HI>Europe, viz.</HI> The Statue of <HI>Olympick Jupiter;</HI> the other two are in <HI>Africa, viz.</HI> The <HI>Pharos</HI> or Watch-Tower, and the <HI>Aegy|ptian Pyramids.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly, Of the Fruitfulne&s;s and Plea&s;antne&s;s of this Part, this may &s;erve for a great Argument, That here was cho&s;en out by God him&s;elf that <HI>Land of Promi&s;e,</HI> for his Cho&s;en People to dwell in, which the Scripture it &s;elf &s;ets forth by the Commendation of <HI>A Land flowing with Milk and Honey:</HI> And <HI>Cicero</HI> repre&s;ents it no le&s;s advantage|ou&s;ly, in one of his Orations to the People of <HI>Rome,</HI> in the&s;e Words; <HI>Caeterarum Provinciarum, Vectigalia, Quirites, tanta &s;unt ut iis, ad ip&s;as Pro|vincias tutandas vix contenti e&s;&s;e p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;umus, A&s;ia verotam opima e&s;t &amp; fertilis, ut &amp; ubertate agrorum &amp; varietate fructuum, &amp; magnitudine Pa&s;tionis, &amp; multitudine earum rerum quae exportent facile omnibus terries antecellat: The Tributes and Taxes, Renowned</HI>

<P>COncerning the Denomination of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> there is &s;ome variety of conjecture, as upon all &s;uch Occa&s;ions happens; but the mo&s;t generally receiv'd is (and that by the Authority of <HI>Herodotus</HI>) That it is deriv'd from the Nymph <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> who is reckon'd by <HI>He&s;iod</HI> among the Forty Daughters of <HI>Oceanus</HI> and <HI>Thetys,</HI> in this Ver&s;e:</P>

<P>This Nymph, the Wife of <HI>Japetus,</HI> and Mother of <HI>Prometheus,</HI> is &s;aid to have been a Queen of great Power and Authority, extending her Domi|nions through a great part of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and thereby to have given Denomination to the whole. How|ever, others derive it from <HI>A&s;ius</HI> the Son of <HI>Cocy|tus;</HI> others, from <HI>A&s;ius</HI> the Son of <HI>Manaeus</HI> the <HI>Lydian;</HI> others, from another <HI>A&s;ius,</HI> an ancient Philo&s;opher, who gave the <HI>Palladium</HI> to the <HI>Tro|jans.</HI> But the Learned <HI>Bochart,</HI> as in all his <HI>Ety|mologies</HI> he goes a more critical way to work, &s;o al&s;o in this, deriving it from the Word <HI>A&s;i,</HI> which in the <HI>Punick</HI> Tongue &s;ignifies <HI>A Middle,</HI> becau&s;e it lies in the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="marg">Hinc in|tranti dextra e&s;t Africa lae|va Europa, inter utra&s;&abque; e&s;t A&s;ia. <HI>Plin.</HI></NOTE> middle between <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Europe;</HI> or perhaps becau&s;e the Mountain <HI>Taurus</HI> runs through the middle of it, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, as <HI>Strabo</HI> ob|&s;erves, thereby dividing it into two Parts, <HI>A&s;ia Interior,</HI> and <HI>Exterior;</HI> that Part to the North being call'd <HI>A&s;ia within Taurus;</HI> that to the South, <HI>A&s;ia without Taurus.</HI> The Exten&s;ion of this Mountain <HI>Taurus,</HI> from <HI>Pamphylia</HI> Ea&s;tward, through the mid&s;t of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> as far as the <HI>Indies,</HI> is elegantly de&s;crib'd by <HI>Diony&s;ius Afer,</HI> in his Po|em <HI>de Situ Orbis.</HI></P>

<P>THE Form of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> is ob&s;erv'd by <HI>Lau|rentius Corvinus,</HI> out of <HI>Anthoninus Ve|ronen&s;is,</HI> to be Conical; that is, be|ginning from the We&s;t with a more ample Extent, and falling &s;harper and &s;harper towards the Ea&s;t, and ending, according to the Account of the Ancients, at a Place which being call'd <HI>Diony&s;ii Columnae,</HI> or <HI>The Pillars of Bacchus,</HI> was once thought to be the utmo&s;t part of <HI>India.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Euphrates</HI> ri&s;eth in <HI>Great Armenia,</HI> and is call'd by the Inhabitants generally <HI>Phrat:</HI> But in its Progre&s;s through &s;everal Countries, it changeth its Name; for, &s;ome &s;pace from its fir&s;t ri&s;ing it is call'd <HI>Pyxirates;</HI> towards its entrance into the Mountain <HI>Taurus, Omira;</HI> again, coming forth from out of the &s;aid Mountain, it takes the Name of <HI>Euphrates;</HI> afterwards it toucheth upon <HI>Me&s;opotamia</HI> on the Left Hand, and <HI>Syria, Arabia,</HI> and <HI>Babylonia</HI> on the Right, and then divides it &s;elf into &s;everal Arms, one whereof takes its Cour&s;e to <HI>Seleucia,</HI> and falls into the River <HI>Tigris;</HI> ano|ther runs through <HI>Babylon,</HI> and lo&s;eth it &s;elf in cer|tain Lakes of <HI>Chaldaea,</HI> but afterwards &s;hoots it &s;elf forth again, and from thenceforth anciently it ran directly towards the Sea, where it di&s;em|bogu'd it &s;elf with a great Mouth; but &s;ince, ha|ving that Cour&s;e &s;topt by the People thereabout, for the fertili&s;ing of the Ground, it was forc'd to take its way through the <HI>Tigris</HI> again. This Ri|ver &s;welling like <HI>Nilus</HI> in &s;ome places, u&s;eth to overflow the Fields of <HI>Me&s;opotamia,</HI> and make them very Fruitful.</P>
<P>The River <HI>Tigris,</HI> by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Tigil,</HI> in like manner hath its Source in <HI>Great Ar|menia,</HI> in a plain Champaign place.

<P>The River <HI>Jordan</HI> &s;prings from two Fountains, though not far di&s;tant frnm each other, the one of them nam'd <HI>Jor,</HI> the other <HI>Dan,</HI> of the contex|ture of which two Words is fram'd the Name of <HI>Jordan.</HI> This River is extremely plea&s;ant and beautiful in its Pro&s;pect: About twelve Miles from its Source it runs into the Lake <HI>Samochonites,</HI> thence into the Lake <HI>Gene&s;ara,</HI> or <HI>Tiberias;</HI> after which it waters <HI>Judaea</HI> and <HI>Samaria;</HI> and la&s;tly, is immer&s;t into the Lake <HI>A&s;phaltites,</HI> or <HI>Dead Sea,</HI> in the way making &s;everal Turnings and Wind|ings, as if loth to lo&s;e it &s;elf and its &s;weet Wa|ters in &s;uch a noi&s;om Sea.</P>

Niger,</HI> be&s;ides &s;everal others call it <HI>Azamia,</HI> and the <HI>Turks,</HI> according to <HI>Megi&s;&s;er, Far&s;ik.</HI> It is a great Country, and hath on the Ea&s;t the two <HI>Carmania;</HI> the We&s;t part thereof borders at <HI>Su&s;iana,</HI> now call'd <HI>Su&s;e</HI> or <HI>Su&s;ter,</HI> otherwi&s;e call'd <HI>Ku&s;i&s;tan;</HI> the North verges with <HI>Media,</HI> now <HI>Sarch;</HI> and the South &s;hoots to the <HI>Per&s;ian Bay</HI> or Sea of <HI>Ormus.</HI></P>
<P>The Coa&s;t of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is every where an open and &s;andy Plains, and without Harbors; yet the In|habitants call all tho&s;e Places where Boats can put in, <HI>Brendor,</HI> that is, <HI>A Haven.</HI></P>
<P>The Sea-Coa&s;t of this Province comprehends the Country inhabited by the <HI>Nautaques, Arabi|ans,</HI> and <HI>Mihelus</HI> or <HI>Nichilu,</HI> which have their Name from that Sea-Coa&s;t, and maintain them|&s;elves by Piracies: They pay Tribute to the <HI>Sefi;</HI> yet &s;ome of them own the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and Sail freely with their Pa&s;&s;es, which &s;ecures them from being mole&s;ted by the <HI>Portugue&s;e Carraks.</HI></P>
<P>On the Bay of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> &s;tands the Fort <HI>Rexel;</HI> and more Northward into the Country lies <HI>Re&s;h Cey|fadin,</HI> that is, <HI>The Tract of Sand of Ceyfadin.</HI></P>
<P>The Metropolis of this Province is <HI>Schiras,</HI> by the <HI>Italians</HI> and Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> nam'd <HI>Siras,</HI> and (according to Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI>) from the pronunciati|on of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> them&s;elves, <HI>Scheraz.</HI> By rea&s;on of its Situation on a Plain, &s;ome term it <HI>Imurezam,</HI> that is, <HI>A Plain-City. Ben Jonas</HI> calls it <HI>Syahaz; O&s;irus, Niras; Sephanus, Cynebatha;</HI> and <HI>Ctelius, Cyropolis,</HI> though mi&s;taken, as Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI> affirms, becau&s;e all the ancient Geographers place the City of <HI>Ciropolis</HI> near the River <HI>Cyrus</HI> in <HI>Hyrcania,</HI> lying in 39 Degrees and a half Northern Lati|tude, whereas <HI>Sciras</HI> lies in 28 Degrees and 44 Minutes.</P>
<P><HI>Aelian</HI> affirms, That there is a <HI>Ciropolis</HI> in <HI>In|dia,</HI> and <HI>Pliny</HI> hath ob&s;erv'd a River of the &s;ame Denomination in <HI>Armenia;</HI> but none of the An|cients make mention of any City of that Name: yet neverthele&s;s <HI>Garcias de Sylva</HI> and <HI>Fiqueroa</HI> certainly believes <HI>Schiras</HI> to be the ancient City of <HI>Ciropolis,</HI> lying in the Province of <HI>Pa&s;argadas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Herbert</HI> would have <HI>Scheraz</HI> to be deriv'd from the word <HI>Sheer,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>Milk</HI> in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tongue; or el&s;e from <HI>Sherap,</HI> which is <HI>A Bunch of Grapes;</HI> for no Place in all <HI>A&s;ia</HI> affords better Vines.</P>
<P>Some, but e&s;pecially <HI>Philips</HI> of <HI>Ferrara,</HI> would have <HI>Sciras</HI> to be the ancient City <HI>Per&s;epolis,</HI> or at lea&s;t that <HI>Sciras</HI> was built out of its Ruins on the &s;ame Foundation: but this is a grand Mi&s;take, becau&s;e <HI>Schiras</HI> is not an ancient City, and the Place where <HI>Per&s;epolis</HI> &s;tood, is above ten <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Miles to the Northward from <HI>Schiras:</HI> Yet ne|verthele&s;s Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI> affirms, that <HI>Schiras</HI> was rai|&s;ed out of the Ruins of <HI>Per&s;epolis.</HI></P>
<P>Some a&s;cribe the building of this City to <HI>Jam|&s;hid,</HI> fifth King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> who (as the Chronicle makes mention) was succeeded by <HI>Chedorlaomer,</HI> not long after the Death of <HI>Noah.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Botterus</HI> tells us, That <HI>Schiras</HI> was built when <HI>Grand-Cair</HI> was but a Village; but according to the Regi&s;ters of the Country, it was built not above &s;even hundred and fifty years ago, a con&s;i|derable time after the <HI>Arabians</HI> made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Moreover, if ancient Traditi|ons may be credited, which are there certainly believ'd, this City is much elder, e&s;pecially if it be true what is related of an <HI>A&s;ian</HI> General call'd <HI>Jenp&s;it,</HI> who is &s;aid to have liv'd many Ages be|fore their Account of Time: And though they differ among&s;t them&s;elves in the Time and Reign of the foremention'd Heroe, yet 'tis very proba|ble that he liv'd a thou&s;and years after the <HI>Flood.</HI> They affirm that he was the Per&s;on who made the great and &s;trange cut Channel, which &s;o abun|dantly waters the whole Country of <HI>Schiras,</HI> by undermining and cutting through the great Moun|tains that lie between the City and Springs, and thereby brought them to their pre&s;ent Perfection; and by this means they furni&s;h the City with &s;uch an abundance of Water, that if all the Channels were cut into one, they would make a very large River.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Schiras,</HI> lying in 28 Degrees and 44 Minutes Northern Latitude, is &s;ituate about ten Leagues from the Ruins of <HI>Per&s;epolis;</HI> near the Stream <HI>Bendamir</HI> or <HI>Bendimir,</HI> on a great Plain in|clos'd with Mountains (except on the &s;ide where you go over a Bridge from <HI>Pa&s;a</HI> into the &s;ame) two Leagues di&s;tant from the City, but on the North &s;carce half a League.</P>
<P>This City was formerly much bigger, and had many more magnificent Buildings than at this day, as plainly appears both within and without its Walls: And the <HI>Arabian</HI> Geographer <HI>Ulug Becig,</HI> Nephew to <HI>Tamerlane,</HI> affirms that it was in his Time three Leagues and a half in Circumfe|rence. The like bigne&s;s <HI>Conta&s;ing</HI> a&s;cribes to the &s;ame, as al&s;o the number of twenty four thou&s;and Houses.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this Age <HI>Schach Abbas,</HI> to puni&s;h the In&s;urrection of one <HI>Jacob Chan,</HI> Gover|nor or Lord of <HI>Schiras,</HI> pull'd down that part of the Wall which was then remaining, and fill'd up the Moat and Trench which &s;urrounded the City.</P>
<P>Both without and within the City are many <HI>Mo&s;ques</HI> or Temples, among&s;t which &s;ome are built very magnificent and beautiful, and e&s;pecially one, which being of an extraordinary bigne&s;s, hath a much higher Steeple upon it than any of the other. The&s;e Towers, which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call <HI>Al|corons,</HI> are narrow, but high, having without two or three Galleries one above another; from whence the <HI>Marabouts</HI> (a &s;ort of Prie&s;ts) publickly read their Prayers with a loud and &s;trong Voice three times a day, and walking round about the Gallery, that they may be the better under&s;tood.</P>
<P>There are very few hand&s;om Structures either without or within the City, except the <HI>Mo&s;ques;</HI> for be&s;ides three Royal Palaces, (of which one is in the City, and the other two in the Suburbs) there is not one fair House: 'tis true, that of the <HI>Chan</HI> or <HI>Sultan,</HI> thoug it be not very beautiful on the out-&s;ide, yet large, and hath many Painted and richly Gilded Apartments within, be&s;ides Galleries, Gardens, Orchards, and plea&s;ant
<PB N="4" REF="12">Walks. All the other, inhabited by Citizens and other eminent Per&s;ons, are &s;mall and mean; the Rooms, except the Hall and two or three Chambers, are &s;o little, that an indifferent Trade&s;|man here, hath better Accommodation than a Nobleman there.</P>
<P>The City hath &s;everal Gates, one of which re|&s;pects the River <HI>Pa&s;argadas,</HI> and is call'd <HI>Darva|za Pa&s;a,</HI> that is, <HI>The Gate of Pa&s;a,</HI> anciently <HI>Pa&s;arga|das:</HI> it is very little, and &s;upported only by the Relicks of an old Mud Wall. Oppo&s;ite to this Gate, towards the We&s;t, is another call'd <HI>Dar|vaza Achem,</HI> that is, <HI>Iron Gate,</HI> at which begins a very fair Street above 2000 Paces long, and every where exactly 90 Paces broad. On each &s;ide of this Street is a Wall of about &s;ixteen Foot high, Plai&s;ter'd over with Mortar, and without any Hou&s;es; behind are &s;pacious Gardens and Or|chards, full of Fruit-trees and curious Banquet|ing-hou&s;es, which belong to the King, and are neatly built, with large Galleries and plea&s;ant Pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>In this fair Street the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> run Races, and perform their Exerci&s;es on Hor&s;eback. At the end of the Streets &s;tands the King's Palace, very hand&s;omly built, with Balconies and Terrace Walks. Before the Court you a&s;cend by two Steps to a little Plain, which is rais'd higher than the Street. At the Entrance, and near the Gal|lery, in the mid&s;t of the Plain, lies a fair and large Pool of Water.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Inhabitants of the City appear every Friday, being the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Sabbath, in a &s;pacious Plain, both on Foot and Hor&s;eback, and are there Exercis'd and Train'd, and afterwards di&s;po&s;e them&s;elves to other Recreations as they think fit.</P>
<P>Near the King's Palace is a fair Hou&s;e with a plea&s;ant Garden, the Work of the Great <HI>I&s;mael Sofi,</HI> very curiou&s;ly built three Stories high; in the &s;econd of which, among other very conveni|ent Apartments, is a large and &s;pacious Hall, ha|ving in the middle an Arch'd <HI>Lover,</HI> full of Gla&s;s Windows. In this Apartment, as al&s;o in the re&s;t on this Story, are divers Pictures of Women, mo&s;t of them Cloth'd after the <HI>Italian</HI> manner.</P>
<P>Under the Galleries which &s;urround this Stru|cture, two are much bigger than the other; one of which being over the Gate looks into the Street, and al&s;o to that Gate of the City which is call'd <HI>Darvaza Pa&s;a.</HI> The other &s;tanding above the fir&s;t, is over the Gate, through which you pa&s;s to go into the Garden, and re&s;pects the We&s;t. Each of the&s;e have three Doors one again&s;t another, &s;o that being in the Hall, which is in the middle of the Edifice, you have the Pro&s;pect not only of the foremention'd Streets and Walks, but al&s;o of the City Gate, and that of the <HI>Haram</HI> or <HI>Seraglio,</HI> in the middle of the Garden, which may ju&s;tly be accounted a Wood of all &s;orts of Fruit-trees, di|vided into Walks, but tho&s;e of the Cypre&s;s and Palm are the chiefe&s;t, which begin at the Court Gate, and extend nine hundred Paces in length, and thirty in breadth; the Walks are very &s;traight and even Planted on both &s;ides with tall Cypre&s;s-trees, which are &s;o big that three Men can &s;carce fathom them, and &s;o high and &s;traight, that they repre&s;ent great Obelisks. At the bot|tom of the Trees is rais'd a Gravel Path or Bank, &s;omewhat higher than the middle Walk, and a|bout five or &s;ix Foot broad, where all People walk; for they go not into the middle part, be|cau&s;e that mu&s;t be kept always green. At the bottom of the&s;e Cypre&s;s-trees, on the out-&s;ide of the Walk, runs a plea&s;ant Brook, which after|wards dividing it &s;elf into &s;everal Branches, wa|ters all parts of the Garden. At the end of the Walk is the <HI>Haram</HI> or <HI>Seraglio,</HI> built after the &s;ame manner as the Hou&s;e before mention'd, but not &s;o large nor high: It is erected on a Plain rais'd &s;even Foot higher than the Garden. On each &s;ide of this Structure is forty Foot of Ground, in which are ten eight-&s;quare Ponds, which are each half a Fathom deep, to &s;erve the Hou&s;e with Water. This Edifice is not cover'd with Tyles, but with Lome and chopt Straw or Chaff, which being temper'd together and bak'd, becomes &s;o hard that no Water will &s;oke through, but runs off into Gutters join'd to the Wells. On this Roof, as al&s;o on tho&s;e of all other Hou&s;es, &s;tands a Marble Pillar of about three or four Foot long, and one thick. On the top of the <HI>Seraglio</HI> you have a Pro&s;pect of the whole Garden, as al&s;o a cool walking-place in the hot Summer Nights.</P>
<P>This Garden affords all &s;orts of <HI>European</HI> Fruits, but e&s;pecially Pears, and Grapes of divers &s;orts, beautiful to the Eye, and very large; al&s;o Pi&s;ta|cho's, Almonds, and Filberds.</P>
<P>Sixty or &s;eventy Paces from the <HI>Haram</HI> appears a &s;quare Fountain, with a hand&s;om A&s;cent; each Square is about a hundred Foot long, and Wall'd with Marble; al&s;o fill'd with Water, in which are kept two Plea&s;ure-boats for the Women to recreate them&s;elves with.</P>
<P>All the Walks are on both &s;ides Hedg'd in with <HI>Province</HI>-Ro&s;es, out of which they Di&s;till abun|dance of Ro&s;e-water, and &s;end it in great quanti|ties to <HI>Ormus,</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> and other remote Coun|tries.</P>
<P>In this large Garden are abundance of great Phea&s;ants, Woodcocks, and other Fowls, which are there as in a Cage, breeding and hatching up their Young.</P>
<P>Ten Leagues from <HI>Schiras</HI> is a Village call'd <HI>Maragaskan,</HI> otherwi&s;e <HI>Marda&s;h;</HI> it lies in 28 De|grees and 48 Minutes Northern Latitude, four League North-We&s;t from the Village <HI>Mahin;</HI> between which the Way is very &s;traight, plea&s;ant, and delightful, being overgrown with Grass. This Village contains about two hundred Hou&s;es, &s;o inclos'd with Trees, that at a di&s;tance it appears to be a Wood divided into &s;everal &s;mall Parks. The Air thereabouts is very temperate, and the Water good and fre&s;h, be&s;ides which all &s;orts of Provi&s;i|ons very cheap.</P>
<P>Near <HI>Marda&s;h,</HI> at the end of a neighboring Plain, nigh the Foot of a high Mountain not far from the Brook <HI>Sirt,</HI> may be &s;een the Ruins of an old Ca|&s;tle, in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Tzehilminar,</HI> that is, <HI>Forty Towers,</HI> though at this Day only thirty of them remain, <HI>viz.</HI> nineteen high ones, and eleven broken ones; but (as <HI>Della Valle</HI> affirms) there are not above twenty, which may be true, and the Place not mi&s;nam'd; for though now &s;o few re|main, without doubt there were more at fir&s;t, the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> word <HI>Thehil</HI> &s;ignifying <HI>Fort,</HI> and <HI>Minar A Tower.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jo&s;eph Barbaro</HI> affirms, that the Towers before mention'd are as big as three Men can Fathom, and (as <HI>Mande&s;lo</HI> relates) con&s;i&s;ts of black and white Marble.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> relate, that this Edifice was erect|ed
<PB N="5" REF="12">by a King call'd <HI>Tzem&s;hied Schach,</HI> famous for Wi&s;dom; but <HI>Olearius</HI> que&s;tions that. Others &s;ay That King <HI>Solomon</HI> built it: and &s;ome believe that <HI>Darius</HI> was the Founder thereof, and that <HI>Iskander,</HI> which is <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> ruin'd it: But <HI>Aelian</HI> a&s;cribes the erecting thereof to King <HI>Cyrus.</HI></P>
<P>The Foundation or Platform of this Structure is about eighty Yards, being cut out of an intire Rock of Marble: They a&s;cend the &s;ame on four pair of Stairs, con&s;i&s;ting of ninety five Steps; cut out of white Marble: On the top, not far from the Stairs, appear four Pieces of a broken Wall, that &s;eem to have been two large Gates; on the fir&s;t two are cut two great Hor&s;es, with &s;trange Furni|ture; and on the other two are other kind of Bea&s;ts, with Bodies like Hor&s;es, but Heads like Lyons with Crowns upon them, and Wings at their Shoulders. Not far from hence, on the right &s;ide, &s;tand the thirty foremention'd Pillars. A lit|tle di&s;tant from the&s;e Towers, and &s;omewhat higher were two indifferent large Chambers, of which are remaining &s;ome of the Doors and Win|dows, which are of Marble, as al&s;o the Walls, which are &s;o poli&s;h'd, that one may &s;ee their Face therein as in a Looking-Gla&s;s. Farther in, on the &s;ide near the Doors, are all manner of ancient Shapes and Figures, hewn in Stone, and bigger than the Life, &s;ome &s;itting, others &s;tanding, with long Hair, broad Beards, and long Coats down to their Feet, with wide Sleeves, a Sa&s;h about their Middle, and &s;trange round Caps on their Heads. Not far from the&s;e Chambers &s;tands a &s;quare Pil|lar, with a great poli&s;h'd Stone in the top, which &s;ome judge to be a Ja&s;per; on this al&s;o, as on &s;e|veral other Columns, are &s;trange Characters En|graven which none can Read.</P>
<P>All that remains of the Relicks or Ruins of an|cient <HI>Per&s;epolis</HI> we find very well de&s;crib'd in Mr. <HI>Herbert,</HI> wherefore we &s;hall give you the De|&s;cription in his following words:</P>
<Q><P>The Ribs or Ruins of <HI>Per&s;epolis</HI> (&s;aith he) are at this Day call'd <HI>Chill-Manor,</HI> or <HI>Chehel-Manor,</HI> that is, <HI>Forty Towers</HI> in the Idiom of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and might more properly have &s;aid <HI>Ha&s;htot-Manor,</HI> or <HI>Eighty Towers,</HI> for &s;o many are ea&s;ily told two Yards out of the Ground; and if from &s;o many Pillars as are perfect and lofty, then may they &s;ay <HI>Nouzda-Manor,</HI> or <HI>Nineteen Towers,</HI> at this Day no more &s;tanding, one excepted at the Ea&s;t below, above a Bowe-&s;hot thence. The whole Ba&s;is is cut by incredible toil out of the &s;olid Marble Rock, twice the compa&s;s of <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> Ca&s;tle, a&s;cended by four&s;core and fifteen ea&s;ie Steps, di&s;&s;ected from the durable black Marble, &s;o broad that a dozen Hor&s;es may go abrea&s;t: the Perpendicular is two and twenty Geome|trick Feet, and where the Stairs are not, the Rock is precipitious: near the highe&s;t Step is the Entrance into the Palate; the Breadth is vi&s;ible, in de&s;pight of Flame and Weather: on one &s;ide of the Gate &s;tands a mon&s;trous great Elephant, on the other a Rhinoceros; the di|&s;tance is about twenty Foot; the Portraicts are cut out of the &s;hining Marble, ten Yards high either of them, fixt and perpetual. A few Paces thence are of like Work, Bulk, and Matter, two gallant Towers; and (to fini&s;h the Porter's Lodge) near them is another Ruine, a <HI>Pega&s;us,</HI> an Invention of the Sculptor to illu&s;trate his Art: And being pa&s;t this Portal, the <HI>Apollo</HI> opens, a fair even Ground, deplorable in many Ruins, a hundred white Marble Pillars, whole and broken, dignifying this once mo&s;t excellent Structure. Upon many of the&s;e white Marble Pillars the Storks have builded their Ne&s;ts, where the rage of Wind and Weather is more offen&s;ive to them than any dread they have of the People who inhabit near them. In all un|&s;ea&s;onable, &s;tormy, or cold Weather, they for|&s;ake the Region, and fly where the Sun can com|fort them. The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have many &s;uper&s;titi|ous Stories concerning them, and &s;uppo&s;e them (as el&s;e-where I have noted) the Emblems of Piety and Gratitude. The Pillars which are at this day &s;tanding (but &s;eem to groan under the Tyranny of Time) are betwixt fifteen and twenty Cubits, and ri&s;e beautifully in forty Squares or concave Parallels, every Square ha|ving full three Inches, whereby the Circuit may be gather'd. Mo&s;t excellent is the Matter, mo&s;t elegant the Work, and no le&s;s commenda|ble the Order and Shape how they are plac'd; in po&s;ture and &s;hew to this day admirable; but when they &s;tood in lu&s;tre and perfection, were el&s;ewhere &s;carce imitable. From the ordinary &s;tanding, we ea&s;ily enjoy'd a mo&s;t delightful Pro&s;pect; but in the Summity or Advantage, a brave Horizon of thirty Miles unlimited Plains, every way gave it &s;elf to this Imperial Palace, as &s;eeming to &s;ubmit it &s;elf in a happy lowli|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>In part of this great Room (not far from the Portal) in a Mirror of poli&s;h'd Marble, we noted above a dozen Lines of &s;trange Characters, very fair, and apparent to the Eye; but &s;o my&s;tical, &s;o odly fram'd, as no <HI>Hieroglyphick,</HI> no other deep Conceit can be more difficultly fancied, more adver&s;e to the Intellect. The&s;e con&s;i&s;ting of Figures Obelisk, Triangular, and Pyramidal, yet in &s;uch Symetry and Order as cannot well be call'd Barbarous: Some re&s;emblance I fan|cied &s;ome Words had of the Antique <HI>Greek,</HI> &s;ha|dowing out <HI>Aha&s;uerus Theos:</HI> And though it have &s;mall concordance with the <HI>Hebrew, Greek,</HI> or <HI>Latin</HI> Letter, yet que&s;tionle&s;s to the Inventer it was well known, and peradventure may con|ceal &s;ome excellent Matter, though to this day wrapt up in the dim Leaves of envious Ob&s;cu|rity.</P>
<P>Adjoyning this, is another &s;quare Room, from Angle to Angle ninety Paces, in circuit three hundred and three&s;core Paces, beautified with eight Doors, four of them being &s;ix Paces broad, and the other four, three apiece; all eight &s;everally compos'd of &s;even great poli&s;h'd Marbles, fix'd one upon another; each of which Stones are four Yards long, five Quarters high, and mo&s;t excellently engraven with Ima|ges of Lions, Griffins, Tygers, and Bulls: and in other Places (for the Walls are durable) Bat|tels, Hecatombs, Triumphs, Olympick Games, and the like, in very rare Sculpture and Propor|tion. Above each Door is engraven the Idea of a Maje&s;tick Monarch; his Robe is long, a <HI>Tiara</HI> or <HI>Mithra</HI> on his Head, his Hair very long, and curl'd; in one Hand he holds a Globe, in the other his Scepter: A Garb and Se&s;&s;ion never us'd by <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Princes. The &s;illy Inhabitants (who made no account of it till of late) name him <HI>Jam&s;het,</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> and <HI>Sam&s;on,</HI> and <HI>Solo|mon:</HI> A wonder they leave out <HI>Ru&s;tan,</HI> their <HI>Hercules,</HI> and as ea&s;ie for invention. A third
<PB N="6" REF="13">Chamber conjoyns the la&s;t we &s;poke of: This (if they lie not that told us &s;o) was a <HI>Gynecie,</HI> or Nur&s;ery. It has four unequal Angles; two &s;ides are &s;ixty, the other two &s;eventy of my large&s;t Paces. From that, we i&s;&s;ued into a fourth Room, two &s;ides whereof are twenty, and the other two, thirty Paces. The Walls are very eminent in this Chamber, of black &s;hining Marble, in ma|ny Places &s;o bright and jetty, as we could ea&s;ily view our Reflex, no Steel Mirror comparing with it. In mo&s;t parts the Walls are cut into Gygantive Images, illu&s;trated with Gold, to this day permanent. Somewhat further, over Heaps of Stones of valuable Portraictures, we mount towards the mo&s;t lofty part of this Pa|lace, where we &s;aw the Re&s;emblances of a de|vout King, adoring his three Deities, the Sun, the Fire, and a Serpent, all which are cut upon the perpendicular Mountain. The other &s;ide of this high Hill is a Precipice, down which is no de&s;cending. But whether this Fabrick was <HI>Ionick, Dorick,</HI> or <HI>Corinthiack,</HI> in the perfection, I cannot determine; the Ruins forbid a po&s;itive Judgment. But &s;uch at this day it is, that a rea|dy Limner in three Months &s;pace can hardly (to do it well) depict out all her Excellencies. Pi|ty it is, it is not done, the barbarous People eve|ry day defacing it, and cleaving it a&s;under for Grave-&s;tones and Benches to &s;it upon. Five Miles We&s;t from <HI>Chehel-manor</HI> is al&s;o a gallant Monument, a Giant cut into a mon&s;trous pro|portion, whom the Illiterate <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> &s;ay was <HI>Ru&s;tan,</HI> and from him call'd <HI>Nocta-Ru&s;tan.</HI> I rather judge it the Image of Great <HI>Alexander,</HI> who had a de&s;ire that after-Ages might think him more than a Man, and his Men more than Mon&s;ters, as appear'd in his Conceit to make many Armors big enough for three Men, and &s;catter them in <HI>India,</HI> that the People might not dare to rebell, le&s;t tho&s;e <HI>Polyphems</HI> came to la&s;h them. So far Mr. <HI>Herbert.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Some &s;uppo&s;e this Edifice to have been a Tem|ple; others, a part of the Royal Court, or a Bu|rying-place for the Kings: but <HI>Della Valle</HI> inclines to the fir&s;t of the&s;e Opinions. This Ruine is, in truth, all that is left or the ancient City <HI>Per&s;epolis,</HI> being burnt by <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> to &s;atisfie the Humor of his Concubine <HI>Thais.</HI></P>
<P>At the Foot of the Mountains, a League Northward from <HI>Hhehel-manor,</HI> are &s;everal old Images by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Noc&s;ci Ro&s;tam,</HI> that is, <HI>The Figures of Ro&s;tam,</HI> who was an anci|ent <HI>Per&s;ian Heroe,</HI> for his notable Exploits and great Atchievements, very famous in their Hi&s;to|ries, as <HI>Hercules</HI> among the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> and &s;aid to have liv'd in the Reign of <HI>Cyrus</HI> and <HI>Cam|by&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>Near the&s;e are al&s;o carv'd on a large and &s;mooth Rock &s;everal other Statues or Images; one where|of &s;itting on Hor&s;e-back, is clad in a long Gar|ment, with a Cap or Bonnet on his Head: In his left Hand he holds a Club, as <HI>Hercules</HI> is u&s;ually repre&s;ented, and in his Right Hand a Ring, which another Hor&s;e-man that is plac'd near him al&s;o holds, both &s;eeming to pull as if they would break it in &s;under. This &s;econd Hor&s;e-man is cloath'd almo&s;t after the &s;ame manner with the fir&s;t, but is bare-headed, and hath very long Hair. There is al&s;o in another place a third Hor&s;e-man, accou|tred after the &s;ame manner, laying his left Hand on the Hilt of his Sword, his right Hand gra&s;p|ing the Sword of a Foot-man that &s;tands before him, threatning as it were another Foot-man, who is bare-headed, and kneeling on one Knee before the Hor&s;e-man.</P>
<P>Not far from hence are &s;een the Repre&s;entati|ons of &s;everal Women, of which the Inhabitants relate many Fables, but e&s;pecially of one, who they &s;ay was the Mi&s;tre&s;s of their Renowned <HI>Ro|&s;tam.</HI></P>
<P>On another &s;ide of this Rock, which is very &s;teep like a Wall, are many Holes like Win|dows, a great di&s;tance from the Ground, and &s;ome bigger than others; yet the lea&s;t are &s;o large, that a Man may ea&s;ily lie at length in them: and therefore it is very probable that the&s;e Holes &s;erv'd for Places of Interment for the Dead; for <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> affirms, That the ancient Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> were buried in the Country about <HI>Per|&s;epolis,</HI> in Holes cut in high Rocks, into which they were lifted with Engines made for that pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>On another adjacent Mountain there is, as <HI>Della Valle</HI> relates, the Image of a Man call'd <HI>Gem&s;chid,</HI> (or as others, <HI>Cho&s;cid,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>The Sun</HI>) who is &s;aid to have Reign'd a con&s;iderabe time in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> before <HI>Cyrus the Great,</HI> and &s;till lives in their Memory, for his great Knowledge in <HI>Necromancy.</HI> Some take this <HI>Gem&s;cid</HI> to be <HI>Nebuchodono&s;or.</HI></P>
<P>About the City <HI>Schiras</HI> lie many Hamlets and Villages, as al&s;o &s;everal Lord&s;hips, call'd in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tongue <HI>Mulk,</HI> that is, <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,</HI> which are under one peculiar Family; for the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors thereof hold them not of the King, neither can he take them away.</P>
<P>On the North &s;ide of the City, as you go to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> lies a Mountain over which you travel along a Stony Road, through which runs a Stream which waters all the adjacent Gardens and Or|chards.</P>
<P>Three Leagues to the Northward of <HI>Schiras</HI> &s;tood a large <HI>Caravan&s;era,</HI> which though half ru|in'd, yet by its great Walls and Arches &s;ufficient|ly te&s;tifies its former Magnitude.</P>
<P>This Province contains four great Cities be|&s;ides <HI>Schiras, viz. Ca&s;irum, Bunitzan, Firu&s;abath,</HI> and <HI>A&s;tar;</HI> as al&s;o the Towns <HI>Arboy, Chiminar, Sa|va,</HI> the Metropolis of <HI>Savas,</HI> formerly the Coun|try of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;abates:</HI> It compri&s;es likewi&s;e <HI>Fi|rusbate, Berdezzil, Senorgande, Cazaran,</HI> by <HI>Texei|ra</HI> call'd <HI>Carriu,</HI> and by <HI>Ananie, Ca&s;rum;</HI> al&s;o <HI>Camara, Zemilen, Bendarepe, Seru&s;tan, Agiane, &amp;c. Texeira</HI> al&s;o places in this Province the&s;e Towns and Villages, <HI>viz. Tarum, Iaharom</HI> or <HI>Jarum, La|&s;ta</HI> or <HI>La&s;tan, Stahabanon, Neriz, Pacah, Daragued,</HI> and <HI>Duzgun,</HI> near <HI>La&s;tan,</HI> between <HI>Comoron</HI> and the City <HI>Lara,</HI> eighteen Leagues from <HI>Ormus.</HI> There are al&s;o the Cities of <HI>Rey</HI> and <HI>Gibal.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t City of this Province, according to <HI>Figueroa,</HI> is <HI>Guin,</HI> as al&s;o <HI>Benaru,</HI> with the Ruins of the Ca&s;tle <HI>Gabriel,</HI> in the utmo&s;t Confines of the Kingdom of <HI>Lara;</HI> though both Places lie very near one another, in a great Plain. The City <HI>Guin</HI> is &s;eparated from the re&s;t of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> by high Mountains, over which you mu&s;t travel to go to <HI>Jarum,</HI> and thence with the <HI>Caravans</HI> through the De&s;art.</P>
<P>It is apparent that this City hath been built many Years, and Peopled by a Colony of <HI>Per&s;i|ans,</HI> becau&s;e the Inhabitants are of a better Spi|rit, and more Moralli&s;ed than the neighbouring wild <HI>Arabians:</HI> Their Complexion al&s;o is whiter,
<PB N="7" REF="13">and the Habit of the Women neater and more Civil. On the left Hand going from <HI>Guin</HI> lies a Village call'd <HI>Denia,</HI> full of fair Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>About two days Journey from <HI>Guin</HI> lies the lit|tle City <HI>Horum,</HI> &s;o call'd from its Beauty and great plenty of Dates; as al&s;o another of the &s;ame denomination, between <HI>Cabre&s;tan</HI> and <HI>Lara.</HI></P>
<P>Between <HI>Guin</HI> and <HI>Horum</HI> you meet with a bar|ren and uninhabited De&s;art, of three days Jour|ney, not having in all that way above two Pits of Water.</P>
<P>The Village <HI>Tarum,</HI> which is the Chief of ma|ny Villages, was much decay'd <HI>Anno</HI> 1630. The Inhabitants thereof are &s;ubject to the Prince of <HI>Lar.</HI> It hath under its Juri&s;diction the Village <HI>Seid Geuder,</HI> beyond which is a large Plain, and at a &s;mall di&s;tance runs the Brook <HI>Ab&s;ciur,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>Salt Water.</HI> A little further is a Village call'd <HI>Pelengon,</HI> that is, <HI>A Panther;</HI> &s;o nam'd from the great number of that &s;ort of Bea&s;ts breeding thereabouts.</P>
<P>Two Leagues from <HI>Pelengon</HI> you come to a narrow way between the Mountains, in the <HI>Per|&s;ian</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Der Tenghi Cebar Rud,</HI> that is, <HI>The narrow Gate of four Streams;</HI> becau&s;e in Rainy Weather four great Currents, which come from &s;everal Places, unite their Waters there.</P>
<P>After three or four Leagues travelling through a plea&s;ant Way, you come to a Place call'd <HI>Curi|hazirgon,</HI> that is, <HI>The Merchants Grave;</HI> perhaps &s;o call'd becau&s;e a Merchant died and was buried there. Four Leagues further lies a &s;olitary and ruin'd Place, nam'd <HI>Ser Zehi Rizevon,</HI> about which &s;tands onely a few Huts, &s;haded on one &s;ide by a Grove of Date-trees: And four Leagues further is <HI>Ta&s;tek,</HI> inhabited by none but the <HI>Rabdary</HI> or Watchmen to guard the Way.</P>
<P>Two Leagues from <HI>Ta&s;tek,</HI> along an even Way between the Mountains, lies a Place call'd <HI>Abi Dungher,</HI> the utmo&s;t extent of the Dukedom of <HI>Lar,</HI> and the beginning of the Country which be|long'd to the King of <HI>Ormus,</HI> when he was ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Arabia.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Road from <HI>Schiras</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan.</HI></NOTE>Travelling from <HI>Schiras</HI> to <HI>Hi&s;pahan,</HI> you pa&s;s by the&s;e Places: <HI>viz.</HI> Fir&s;t, the Village <HI>Zargan,</HI> in which is a hand&s;om and well-built <HI>Mo&s;que.</HI> Four Leagues further you come to <HI>Mahin,</HI> which being an open Town, contains between five and &s;ix hun|dred Hou&s;es; but is &s;o inclos'd with Gardens and Orchards of all &s;orts of Fruit-trees, that it rather &s;eems at a di&s;tance a &s;hady Grove than a Town.</P>
<P>A little forward from <HI>Mahin</HI> you come to ano|ther Village call'd <HI>Amanzada,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting onely of a few Hou&s;es, all enclo&s;ed within a Wall'd <HI>Ca|ravan&s;era,</HI> in which &s;tands al&s;o a rich <HI>Pagode,</HI> out of who&s;e Revenue all Travellers that re&s;t there are maintain'd for three days.</P>
<P>The whole way from <HI>Mahin</HI> to this <HI>Caravan&s;era</HI> is very craggy, and trouble&s;om to travel, and is border'd on the left Hand by a high Mountain, who&s;e top lies crown'd with Snow till the middle of Summer.</P>
<P>Three Leagues from <HI>Amanzada</HI> lies <HI>Ugion,</HI> a Village on a Plain; and between both, a very &s;teep Mountain, who&s;e Southern &s;ide is full of <HI>Lentisk</HI> Trees, out of which drops <HI>Ma&s;tick.</HI></P>
<P>In this Place &s;tands a <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> to which the Na|tives &s;hew great Reverence, by rea&s;on of a Tomb in which lies Interr'd one of <HI>Aly</HI>'s Succe&s;&s;ors; and the Villagers report, that many &s;ick, blind, and decrepit People have receiv'd Health, and been re&s;tor'd to their Sight and Limbs, by imploring the aid of the foremention'd Per&s;on, whom they account a Saint. The Plain on which this Vil|lage is &s;ituate is water'd by a &s;mall River, who&s;e Stream, though muddy, is yet very full of Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Four Leagues from <HI>Ugion</HI> is <HI>Acopas,</HI> a &s;mall Vil|lage, enclos'd with a Mud-wall, and &s;urrounded with high Mountains. In the middle of the Vil|lage, on a Mount, &s;tands a &s;mall decay'd Fort, round about which, and within the Walls, are above a hundred Hou&s;es, mo&s;t of them Inhabi|ted by <HI>Circa&s;&s;ians.</HI> Hard by &s;tands a large <HI>Cara|van&s;era;</HI> and not far from it a Garden, planted with divers &s;orts of Fruit-trees, and curious Walks of Cypre&s;s and Palm-trees, which one <HI>Alavardy Chan</HI> planted a little before his death.</P>
<P>Four or five Leagues from <HI>Acopas</HI> lies <HI>Curcuzar,</HI> a &s;mall Fortified Town, with a <HI>Caravan&s;era</HI> ad|joyning. All the way between <HI>Acopas</HI> and <HI>Cur|cuzar</HI> is low and Mora&s;&s;ie; the Air al&s;o is unwhole|&s;om: Wherefore the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have not without great rea&s;on call'd this Place <HI>Curcuzar,</HI> which &s;ig|nifies <HI>Infectious Air.</HI></P>
<P>Beyond this is the Village <HI>Dergriger,</HI> three Leagues from which &s;tands a <HI>Caravan&s;era,</HI> and another pretty Town; next to which follows <HI>Comixan,</HI> containing about fifteen hundred Fami|lies.</P>
<P>A little beyond <HI>Comixan</HI> lies the Dorp <HI>Mahiar:</HI> And la&s;tly, between that and <HI>Hi&s;pahan,</HI> about a League from the latter, is a Village nam'd <HI>Ja|ru&s;tan.</HI></P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is water'd by a large River, call'd <HI>Cur,</HI> which is a corrupt Name of <HI>Cyrus. Philip of Ferara</HI> in his <HI>Geography, Olearius,</HI> and others, will have this to be the &s;ame River which the <HI>Latins</HI> call'd <HI>Begradas:</HI> But <HI>Della Valle</HI> contradicts this Opinion, affirming, That <HI>Bendemir</HI> is the Name of a Bridge which lies cro&s;s the Ri|ver, near the way coming from <HI>I&s;pahan</HI> to <HI>Schiras;</HI> but its right name is <HI>Curis,</HI> as is before mention'd; for <HI>Bend-Emir</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>The Bridge of Emir,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call a Bridge <HI>Bend,</HI> and <HI>Emir</HI> was the Name of the Builder.</P>
<P>The ancient Writers make mention of two Ri|vers in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> which bear the Name of <HI>Cyrus;</HI> the one whereof having wa&s;ht <HI>Armenia</HI> and <HI>Albania,</HI> di&s;charges its Water into the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea,</HI> and, as <HI>Olearius</HI> &s;ays, is at this day call'd <HI>Cur</HI> or <HI>Aras.</HI></P>
<P>The other, which we now &s;peak of, glides from the North to the South through <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> by the Walls of the City <HI>Schiras,</HI> and falls into the <HI>Per|&s;ian</HI> Gulph. From the Banks of this River the famous <HI>Cyrus</HI> was thrown in his Infancy, and gave his Name to the Place, and not to that where he was born, which was call'd <HI>Agradat.</HI></P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the <HI>Per&s;ian Geographers,</HI> as <HI>Olearius, Garcias de Sylva, Figueroa,</HI> and others, judge the River <HI>Cur,</HI> or <HI>Bendemir,</HI> to be the &s;ame; with <HI>Araxes.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Araxes</HI> is the bigge&s;t of all tho&s;e Rivers which water the Provinces of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Lara;</HI> not|with&s;tanding which, it is not very broad, but runs in a narrow Channel, in many Meanders, between high Mountains, being well repleni&s;h'd with all &s;orts of Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>This River takes its Original out of the Moun|tain <HI>Je&s;&s;el,</HI> lying between the famous Cities <HI>Su&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Marga&s;can,</HI> formerly call'd <HI>Su&s;a</HI> and <HI>Per&s;epolis;</HI> and fir&s;t directingits Cour&s;e Southward, bends
<PB N="7" REF="14">afterwards to the Ea&s;t, &s;eparating the ancient Province of <HI>Su&s;iana</HI> from the We&s;tern part of <HI>Car|mania,</HI> and &s;o enters into the Kingdom of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and after having receiv'd the Waters of many little Rivolets, and divided the Province of <HI>Ker|man</HI> and the ancient <HI>Caramie Foelix,</HI> finding its Current to the Sea &s;topt by the exceeding high Mountains, it returns with great force to the North-Ea&s;t, being grown bigger than before, and much deeper, by the Waters which fall from the fore-mention'd Mountains; thence it again runs Southward, vi&s;iting the ancient <HI>Gedro&s;ie,</HI> and at la&s;t falls into the <HI>Indian</HI> Sea, making a &s;pacious Bay.</P>
<P>Near the Ruins of <HI>Cehil Minar,</HI> and the ancient <HI>Per&s;epolis,</HI> glides the River <HI>Pelevar,</HI> which takes its Cour&s;e towards the South, and falls into the <HI>Cur,</HI> after having fir&s;t water'd one of the fruitful|e&s;t Parts of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is very Mountainous in &s;everal Places; but they are not altogether &s;terill: for the Moun|tains of <HI>Neriz</HI> have many Iron Mines; and &s;ome relate that many <HI>Smaragds</HI> are found in this Pro|vince. About ten or twelve Leagues from <HI>Schi|ras</HI> are &s;everal high Hills, full of Palm and Len|tisk-Trees, where breed many Wild Hogs.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Schiras,</HI> which is common to all the other Provinces of this Kingdom, are very white, the Women generally beautiful, and the Men well-proportion'd.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a great Trade driven in <HI>Schiras,</HI> occa&s;ion'd by the <HI>Caravans,</HI> which coming from <HI>Samarcand</HI> and <HI>Zagatay,</HI> pa&s;s through this Place with great Quantities of Silk, Musk, Rhubarb, and <HI>Turcoi&s;es;</HI> all which tho&s;e of <HI>Chorazzan</HI> re|ceive from the Merchants which come from <HI>Ca|tay,</HI> or the Northern <HI>China.</HI> And by this means <HI>Schiras</HI> furni&s;hes other Countries with Provi&s;ions, as Wooll, Copper, and many other things; be|&s;ides Di&s;till'd Ro&s;e-water; for they make ano|ther &s;ort than we in <HI>Europe,</HI> by decocting the Ro|&s;es. They al&s;o get abundance of Silk from the Silk-worms they breed here; and have likewi&s;e Rubies, <HI>Balay&s;es</HI> (which come from the City <HI>Bala|&s;an,</HI>) and great &s;tore of <HI>Lazuus</HI> Stones, and <HI>Tutty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Per&s;ia</HI> or <HI>Fars</HI> is not very cold, though its Situ|ation be more Northerly than the other Provin|ces; for in <HI>December</HI> all the Gardens about <HI>Schiras</HI> are green, and the Trees retain their Leaves; be|cau&s;e the Ground being moi&s;ten'd by &s;o many Rivers, is not onely pre&s;erv'd from all extraordi|nary Scorchings, but &s;o cooled, and the Fruit be|comes ripe &s;o late, that it may be pre&s;erv'd all the Winter, and kept very good till <HI>March.</HI></P>
<P>The Country about <HI>Schiras,</HI> and the Plains be|tween the Mountains and the River <HI>Pa&s;a,</HI> is natu|rally dry and barren.</P>
<P>The Country about <HI>Rexel,</HI> near the Sea-coa&s;t, yields very excellent Wheat, and al&s;o good &s;tore of Fruit: That Tract of Land which extends Southerly produces abundance of Dates; as al&s;o the Ground about the City <HI>Com:</HI> but no Vines. The Country of <HI>Tarom,</HI> with the other neigh|boring Places, are all planted with Date-trees, under who&s;e the Inhabitants &s;ow Cotton. There is al&s;o abundance of Sweet-briar, out of who&s;e Flowers the Inhabitants di&s;till a &s;ort of Water which they call <HI>Gulaep,</HI> that is, <HI>Ro&s;e-water.</HI></P>
<P>Out of the gaping Ciefts of a high Mountain in the Country <HI>Stahanon,</HI> di&s;tils a Liquor or Juyce which the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> cau&s;es to be gather'd by Per&s;ons &s;worn for that purpo&s;e, which yearly take up thirty <HI>Meticals,</HI> or about forty or fifty Ounces of the &s;aid Di&s;tillation, which by the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> is call'd <HI>Monmaky Cony,</HI> that is, <HI>Precious Water;</HI> and is kept onely for the King's U&s;e: it being, as they affirm, an excellent Antidote again&s;t all Poy&s;on, and an infallible Remedy again&s;t inward Brui&s;es, as al&s;o outwardly apply'd for Sinew-&s;trains, Con|tu&s;ions, and the like. The King many times be|&s;tows &s;ome of it upon tho&s;e Princes that are in League with him, as an extraordinary Mark of his Favor. In &s;tead of this, the <HI>Turks</HI> u&s;e <HI>Terra Si|gillata;</HI> the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> of the Ea&s;tern Countries, <HI>Pazar Cony,</HI> which is a kind of <HI>Jews-Gum,</HI> gather'd at <HI>Maxulpata,</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;ulipatan,</HI> in <HI>India;</HI> but is not of that Vertue and Power as this of <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>About <HI>Schiras</HI> the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> find a &s;ort of bitter Root, by the Apothecaries call'd <HI>Co&s;t,</HI> from the example of the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> though they generally add the Word <HI>Talk</HI> to the &s;ame, <HI>viz. Co&s;t-Talk,</HI> that is, <HI>Bitter Co&s;t,</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the common <HI>Indian Co&s;t,</HI> which they call <HI>Co&s;t Xerir,</HI> that is, <HI>Sweet Co&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Bitter Co&s;t</HI> hath a Root very hard and firm, of a yellow Colour, &s;omewhat inclining to white, if it be fre&s;h and good; but if it be digg'd out of &s;ea&s;on, or carele&s;ly dry'd, it becomes blue or brown: The Shell or Rind is &s;treak'd, and the Pulp white, and bitteri&s;h: The old Roots are very un&s;avory and ill-ta&s;ted. It is brought into <HI>Eu|rope</HI> either in round Pieces, or el&s;e in long Slices.</P>
<P>The Country about <HI>La&s;tan</HI> produces abundance of <HI>Ingo,</HI> by the Apothecaries call'd <HI>A&s;&s;a foetida.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Fars</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> e&s;pecially about <HI>Schiras,</HI> they have very excellent Wine, the be&s;t in all <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> which they call <HI>Xarao</HI> or <HI>Charab;</HI> and it is &s;ent to all Parts of the Country, e&s;pecially to the Court; for the King and his Nobles drink no other: and if any Per&s;on of Quality entertains another, he al|ways treats him with this Wine.</P>
<P>This Province al&s;o produces Bezoar-&s;tones, which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> properly call <HI>Pazahar,</HI> which is a Compound Word of <HI>Pa</HI> and <HI>Zahar,</HI> the fir&s;t &s;ignifying <HI>Again&s;t,</HI> and the other <HI>Poy&s;on:</HI> They are chiefly found in a County call'd <HI>Stabanon,</HI> three days Journey from <HI>Lara;</HI> where al&s;o grows in the Fields a Plant like Saffron, which the Goats eating, cau&s;es the foremention'd Stones to grow in their Stomachs, and are e&s;teem'd above all other Gems by the King of <HI>Per&s;ia:</HI> Nay, the Fields wherein the &s;aid Goats graze are con&s;tantly guarded, and the collecting of the Stones look'd after by Officers appointed particularly for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a Stone by the Phy&s;icians call'd <HI>Lapis Judaicus,</HI> that is, <HI>The Jews Stone;</HI> and by the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Arabians, Ager Alyud,</HI> that is, <HI>The Stone of Judas.</HI> There is likewi&s;e the <HI>Armenian Stone,</HI> otherwi&s;e call'd <HI>Lapis Lazuli,</HI> and in the <HI>Per|&s;ian</HI> Tongue nam'd <HI>Ager Armeni,</HI> that is, <HI>The Arme|nian Stone.</HI></P>
<P>Among&s;t many other Bea&s;ts which breed in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> there is one peculiar to this Province, which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call <HI>Ca&s;tar,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards, Adives;</HI> and is perhaps the <HI>Hyena</HI> of the Ancients. They breed for the mo&s;t part in the Hedges about <HI>Schi|ras,</HI> and are, as <HI>Garcias de Sylva</HI> affirms, a kind of Dogs bred fir&s;t in <HI>Barbary.</HI> They come in great companies out of the Hedges in the Night, to &s;eek for Prey, making a hideous howling. They are naturally &s;o &s;ubtile, that if they were not &s;o
<PB N="8" REF="14">very greedy, they could not be taken. They tear up the Graves in the Fields, and devour the Dead Bodies; and often, when hungry, they ven|ture into Hou&s;es, where if they find any thing, they call their Companions, by making a great noi&s;e; whereof the Inhabitants taking notice, &s;urround and catch them.</P>
<P>This Province of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> comprehends the an|cient Kingdom or Dukedom of <HI>Lar,</HI> or <HI>Lara,</HI> with a Metropolis of the &s;ame; denomination; from whence the <HI>Laryns</HI> (a Coin &s;o current in all the Ea&s;tern Countries) had their name, as we ob|&s;erv'd before.</P>
<P>The Province of <HI>Lara</HI> is by <HI>Figueroa</HI> accounted part of the old <HI>Carmanie,</HI> as <HI>O&euml;&s;sa</HI> (commonly call'd the Kingdom of <HI>Monbareca</HI>) the other part; be|&s;ides the Countries of <HI>Mogo&s;than.</HI> This ancient Dukedom was formerly po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by a peculiar Prince, who Govern'd with an Arbitrary Power, and not &s;ubject to the Crown of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> The la&s;t Prince, according to <HI>Ga&s;par Bernardino,</HI> was call'd <HI>Abrahi Mochom;</HI> but by <HI>Della Valle, Ibrahim Chan;</HI> by <HI>Figueroa, Hambrain Chan;</HI> and by our Mr. <HI>Her|bert, Erahim Cawn;</HI> an Athei&s;tical and bloody|minded Per&s;on. But <HI>Alvaredy Chan, Sultan</HI> of <HI>Schiras,</HI> invading him, <HI>Anno</HI> 1602. by the Com|mand of <HI>Schach Abbas,</HI> &s;torm'd the City of <HI>Lar,</HI> and kill'd the King, be&s;ides all the Nobility and Gentry, to the number of five thou&s;and; cau&s;ing al&s;o the Ca&s;tles to be pull'd down, and the Walls thrown to the Ground, leaving nothing &s;tanding that was of any Strength or Con&s;equence. And in this manner the Kingdom of <HI>Lar</HI> was joyn'd to the Crown of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and added to the Dominion of <HI>Schiras.</HI></P>
<P>The City <HI>Lar</HI> at <HI>Lara</HI> is a very ancient City, and of great note among&s;t the <HI>Arabians,</HI> being the Metropolis, as <HI>Figueroa</HI> &s;uppo&s;es, of the old <HI>Car|manie.</HI> It is &s;ituate in 27 Degrees and a half of Northern Latitude, at the end of a great Plain, &s;o enclos'd with Mountains, that they leave onely a little Opening or Way, which leads to <HI>Schiras.</HI> When this City was fir&s;t built, cannot certainly be re&s;olv'd: Some a&s;cribe the Age thereof to that of our fir&s;t Forefathers; others &s;ay, it was founded not much above a thou&s;and years ago.</P>
<P>The Walls of the Hou&s;es are made of Sun|dry'd Bricks and Clay, and pla&s;ter'd over with a kind of Mortar made of chopt Straw and Earth, which the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> u&s;e in all their Buildings, e&s;pe|cially in the Provinces of <HI>Lara, Querman,</HI> and <HI>Per|&s;ia.</HI> Mo&s;t of them are but one Story high, having few Windows, and tho&s;e very &s;mall, and cover d with Lattices, or &s;topt with Mats.</P>
<P>In this City is an ancient Palace, formerly the Re&s;idence of the Prince, with a large Court be|fore it; which had &s;tood empty a con&s;iderable time, when the <HI>Chan</HI> of <HI>Schiras</HI> came to <HI>Lar</HI> to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof.</P>
<P>Here are likewi&s;e two other remarkable Pla|ces: The one, a Ca&s;tle or Fort; the other, the <HI>Bazar,</HI> or Exchange. The fir&s;t, being almo&s;t half a League in circumference, is built of Free-&s;tone, on the We&s;t &s;ide of the City, on a little Hill, and fortified with thirty eight &s;trong Bulwarks, which defend the City from any outward At|tempts, and al&s;o Commands it.</P>
<P><HI>Figueroa</HI> affirms, That the Ca&s;tle covers the whole top of the Mountain, which is Oval, and fortified with a Stone Wall, and a Brea&s;t-work, with divers Loop-holes for &s;mall Shot. It is ve|ry large in circumference, and hath a Well with excellent Water, above two hundred Fathom deep; for it reaches quite down to the City: yet is the Water neverthele&s;s very ea&s;ily drawn up, with a Wheel turn'd by an Ox.</P>
<P>The other Place of note in this City, is the <HI>Bazar;</HI> that is, A Street full or Shops, like the Exchange. This <HI>Bazar</HI> was the Work of <HI>Alva|redy Chan,</HI> the before-mention'd <HI>Sultan</HI> of <HI>Schiras;</HI> and is without doubt one of the faire&s;t and be&s;t in all <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> It con&s;i&s;ts of an exact Square, en|clos'd within high Walls of white Stone, each Square being 150 Paces, and in every one a large Gate, through which you enter into a fair Walk, that opens into four Rows of Shops, each twenty Foot broad, making a Cro&s;s-way; in the middle whereof is a very high Turret, full of large Win|dows, built on four Arches of Stone, which ta|king their beginning from thence, cover the four Walks: The Materials &s;o neatly painted and po|li&s;h'd, that they out-vie Marble: The Ground is al&s;o very curiou&s;ly pav'd. In four other Squares, but much le&s;s than the former, are four other &s;mall Cro&s;s-ways, which have al&s;o a Turret in the mid|dle of each; from whence, as from the great one, run four other le&s;&s;er Arched Walks of fifteen or &s;ixteen Foot broad. Almo&s;t in the middle, un|der the great Turret or Arch, is a Spring of Fre&s;h Water, which is brought thither in Pipes from Places far di&s;tant, and convey'd from thence to all Parts of the City.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Bazar</HI> are &s;old all manner of Merchan|di&s;es, as well in the Shops by the Inhabitants, as by Foreign Merchants, who &s;tay here all day to vend their Goods, and return to their Lodgings in the Evening, when the <HI>Bazar</HI> is lock'd up, and guarded by a Company of Soldiers appointed for that purpo&s;e. In &s;ome of the&s;e Shops are &s;old both Green, Dry'd, and Pre&s;erv'd Fruit; as al&s;o In-land Bread, call'd <HI>Hapas</HI> or <HI>Curichas:</HI> But the Country-People which bring their Commodities to &s;ell, have no peculiar Shops, but lay their Mer|chandi&s;e on Stalls before the Shops, leaving a &s;ufficient &s;pace between, for the People to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Near the <HI>Bazar</HI> is the Mint, where they Coin the <HI>Laryns</HI> before-mention'd.</P>
<P>There are few <HI>Mo&s;ques</HI> here; but among&s;t tho&s;e which are, there is one built round, to repre&s;ent <HI>Eternity,</HI> after the &s;ame manner with the <HI>Alcaba</HI> or Holy <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> at <HI>Mecha,</HI> which <HI>Schach Abraham</HI> is &s;aid to have brought from Heaven. On &s;ome Places thereof are <HI>Arabian</HI> Letters, Cyphers, and &s;hort Sentences graven, after the <HI>Mo&s;aick</HI> manner. It is a low Structure, having in &s;tead of Windows onely Carv'd Balli&s;ters. The Entrance into the &s;ame is through a Copper Gate, near which hangs a great Looking-gla&s;s. There are al&s;o many Lamps, &s;ome of which are kept continually burn|ing, and others hang onely for Ornament. Some of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Prophets lie here interr'd; and among&s;t others, one call'd <HI>Emir Ally Zedday Amir,</HI> who, if what they affirm upon Oath may be cre|dited, hath been there above 1500 Years, <HI>viz.</HI> 600 Years before <HI>Mahomet;</HI> yet neverthele&s;s, they &s;tick not to affirm, that he was a good <HI>Mu&s;elman</HI> or <HI>Mahumetan.</HI></P>
<P>At <HI>Lar</HI> is the u&s;ual meeting-place of the <HI>Cara|vans</HI> or <HI>Cafilas</HI> which travel from <HI>Per&s;ia, Querman,</HI> and other Places, to the I&s;le of <HI>Ormus;</HI> and come from thence, and <HI>Arabia,</HI> to the&s;e Provinces: Wherefore this City is much frequented by Mer|chants,
<PB N="8" REF="15">as well <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> as <HI>Benjans</HI> and <HI>Jews;</HI> and to that purpo&s;e are built many <HI>Ca|ravan&s;eras,</HI> for the accommodation of &s;trange Mer|chants that come thither with their Commodities.</P>
<P>This City hath been much ruin'd by Earth|quakes, one of which, in <HI>Anno</HI> 1400. threw down above a hundred Hou&s;es; and another, <HI>Anno</HI> 1593. above three hundred, or, as <HI>Texeira</HI> affirms, five hundred; at which time al&s;o many Water-Ce|&s;terns, and the greate&s;t part of the City Walls were &s;poil'd. The ancient Ca&s;tle formerly built by a <HI>Georgian</HI> call'd <HI>Melek,</HI> on a Stone Rock on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the City, was al&s;o ca&s;t down.</P>
<P>A League from <HI>Lar</HI> is a <HI>Caravan&s;era</HI> call'd <HI>Char|caph.</HI></P>
<P>The la&s;t Place in this Dukedom of <HI>Lar,</HI> at the entrance of the Country which belong'd to the King of <HI>Ormus,</HI> when he was ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter of his whole Kingdom on the Main Continent of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Arabia,</HI> is <HI>Abi Dunger.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the Climate, we cannot &s;ay there is any great Cold at <HI>Lar,</HI> the Air being &s;o tempe|rate, that in <HI>March</HI> you can &s;carce get into the City, for the abundance of Flies and Gnats, which in great Swarms fill the Air. But in <HI>June</HI> there blows &s;uch a hot and dry Wind, that on all Pla|ces over which it pa&s;&s;es, it leaves Impre&s;&s;ions as of Fire; and withal &s;corches the Faces, Hands, and Legs of Strangers, to their great trouble and pain; call'd therefore by the <HI>Per&s;ians Bad Semum,</HI> that is, <HI>An infectious and burning Wind.</HI></P>
<P>The whole Country of <HI>Lar</HI> is very de&s;titute of Water; for there are neither Brooks, Springs, nor Wells; onely in &s;everal Places on the Road are plac'd Troughs, which catch the Rain-water, which &s;erves for the accommodation and refre&s;h|ment of Travellers. Mr. <HI>Herbert</HI> &s;ays, this Wa|ter is very unwhole&s;om, and occa&s;ions many Di|&s;tempers, as well in the Inhabitants as Strangers; <HI>viz.</HI> Rheums, Sore Throats, and Worms in the Legs, which cau&s;es Itching and Lamene&s;s, and is not to be cur'd without taking out the Worm; and this mu&s;t al&s;o be done with great care; for if the Worm chance to break, it cau&s;es Putrefaction and Numbne&s;s in the Part affected, which is only to be remedied by continual cutting and &s;la&s;hing of the Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>There is nothing worthy of prai&s;e in all the Country about <HI>Lar,</HI> but the Charitable Inclina|tions of divers of the Inhabitants, who, be&s;ides the Ce&s;terns which the ancient Kings of <HI>Lara</HI> and their Governors made, for the Publick good and Refre&s;hment of the Inhabitants and Travellers which come daily hither, in their la&s;t Wills ap|point certain Per&s;ons to build with their E&s;tates Ce&s;terns, <HI>Caravan&s;eras,</HI> and Alms-hou&s;es; &s;ome great, and others little, according to their Capaci|ties, and Zeal in their Religion: and by this means there are &s;o many Ce&s;terns, that the adja|cent Plain is full of them; and the Water therein is very clear and cool in Summer, notwith&s;tanding the great Heat.</P>
<P>About <HI>Lar</HI> and the Parts adjacent are &s;everal &s;orts of Fruit-trees, as Oranges, Lemmons, and the be&s;t Dates in all <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Mo&s;t of the Inhabi|tants live on Dates, partly by making them their Food, and partly by &s;elling and bartering them for other Nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Lar</HI> and <HI>Gamron</HI> grows abundance of <HI>A&s;&s;a Foetida,</HI> by the <HI>Maleyans</HI> and <HI>Javanners</HI> call'd <HI>Hin.</HI></P>
<P>The ancient Inhabitants of this Country were <HI>Arabians,</HI> of which there are yet many living.</P>

<P>This South part of <HI>Schamachie</HI> lies like a pecu|liar Town, &s;eparated from the Northern by a little Hill, which &s;erves as a publick Market-place to both.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, that when the <HI>Turk</HI> conquer'd this City, and went about afterwards to fortifie it, he demoli&s;h'd the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tombs, to repair the City Walls with the Material thereof.</P>
<P>The North part of the City lies at the foot of another Hill, and being &s;omewhat le&s;s than the foremention'd South part, is &s;urrounded with a &s;leight Stone Wall, &s;o ruin'd, that though the Gates, which are five in number, belock'd, you may get into the City at any time of the Night over the Walls.</P>

<P>THe Kingdom of <HI>Amadan</HI> or <HI>Hamadan,</HI> is by <HI>Texeira</HI> call'd <HI>Amedon,</HI> as al&s;o the chief City thereof, which lying between <HI>Ca&s;|bin</HI> and <HI>Curdi&s;tan,</HI> extends thirty Leagues, and boa&s;ts fifteen Towns, the Inhabitants whereof are all Merchants.</P>
<P><HI>Della Valle</HI> tells us, that the City of <HI>Amadan</HI> lies in the Way which leads from <HI>Bagdad</HI> or <HI>Ba|bylon</HI> to <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> and is large and populous, and much frequented by Strangers, though the Buil|dings are very mean, rather like tho&s;e in an ordi|nary Village; yet behind the&s;e Hou&s;es are fair Gardens full of Fruit-trees, &s;o al&s;o are the Streets, Markets, and other publick Places, which are al&s;o well furni&s;h'd with all manner of Provi&s;ion at rea&s;onable Rates: All the Streets where the Shops are (by them call'd <HI>Bazars</HI>) are Arch'd and Pillar'd like <HI>Piazza's.</HI> It is exceeding cold here, for you not onely &s;ee Ice in the Streets, but it of|ten Freezes any liquid thing in the Chambers though there is a con&s;tant Fire kept.</P>
<P>This City is the Re&s;idence of a <HI>Chan,</HI> who hath many Towns and Villages under his Juri&s;diction, as al&s;o a <HI>Daroga</HI> or Deputy.</P>
<P>Thus much of every Province of the King|dom of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> in particular; next we will give you an Account of what concerns <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and all the Provinces in general, and al&s;o of &s;uch Remarks of &s;ome Provinces in particular, as &s;hall be requi&s;ite to be &s;poken of, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Air, Property of the Soil, Plants, Bea&s;ts, Cu&s;toms, Food, Liquors, Language, Learning, Funerals, Arms, Religions, Government, and what el&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary to be de&s;crib'd.</P>

<HEAD>Temperature of the Air.</HEAD>
<P>THe Air of the&s;e Countreys is for the mo&s;t part very healthful and temperate, with very little Rain, e&s;pecially towards the South, and in &s;ome places (as in <HI>Gamaron</HI> near the Sea-Coa&s;t) not once in three years.</P>
<P>By rea&s;on of the va&s;t Extent of <HI>Per&s;ia, viz.</HI> from the twenty fifth Degree of the <HI>Equinoctial Line,</HI> to the thirty &s;eventh Degree Northward, and likewi&s;e for the rough rocky Mountains of <HI>Taurus,</HI> which run through the middle of the Coun|trey, and &s;pread out with &s;everal Arms, the Air is not every where alike temper'd, but different in many Provinces. Such as dwell Southward from the Mountains feel the Heat exceedingly in the Summer, but tho&s;e to the Northward have the Sea&s;ons more temperate; wherefore the <HI>Per|&s;ian</HI> Kings us'd formerly at Set-times in the Year, for their Plea&s;ure and Health &s;ake, to remove their Courts to &s;uch Provinces, where they judg'd the Weather would be&s;t agree with them: for in the Summer they kept their Courts at <HI>Ecbatane,</HI> now call'd <HI>Thus,</HI> where becau&s;e of the Mountains in the South-We&s;t, it is very cool, and in the Winter at <HI>Su&s;a,</HI> now <HI>Su&s;i&s;tan;</HI> which City lies next to the Northern Mountains, on which the Sun-beams reflecting, make the &s;ame a warm and delightful Place, as appears by the Name, for <HI>Su&s;a</HI> in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tongue &s;ignifies a <HI>Lilly.</HI> In <HI>September</HI> and <HI>March</HI> they remov'd to <HI>Per&s;epolis</HI> and <HI>Babylon.</HI></P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to this day make u&s;e of this convenience of the Air, for <HI>Schach Abbas</HI> in the Winter re&s;ided in the Province of <HI>Mazanderan</HI> at <HI>Ferabath; Schach Sefi</HI> (according to the Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Kings) often going on Progre&s;s, &s;ome|times kept his Court in <HI>Tabris,</HI> otherwhile in <HI>Ar|debil</HI> or <HI>Ca&s;bin:</HI> But the pre&s;ent Seat of the Kings being in <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> is no inconvenient Place either in Winter or Summer, becau&s;e it is &s;ituate on a Plain three Leagues from the Mountains, and en|joys commonly a very temperate Air.</P>
<P>All Strangers in their travelling through <HI>Per|&s;ia</HI> are &s;en&s;ible of this alteration of the Air in &s;e|veral places, not without great prejudice to their Health, being forc'd by rea&s;on of the exce&s;&s;ive Heat to travel in the Night, and re&s;t in the Day, e&s;pecially between the Mountains, where the Pa&s;&s;age goes Southward. But in all parts of <HI>Per|&s;ia</HI> it is very cold in Winter, and &s;ometimes tra|velling Ea&s;tward with a Northerly Wind it is &s;o exceeding cold, that the Travellers lighting from their Hor&s;es in the Morning, are &s;o benumm'd that they can hardly &s;tand.</P>
<P><HI>Della Valle</HI> &s;ays, that the Heat in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is not very great, yet the Beams of the Sun in the Plains are much hotter than in <HI>Italy.</HI> The Inhabitants in the Summer go Cloth'd in a thin Sute of Callico, in which they walk and do all their Bu&s;ine&s;s. Neither is the Cold trouble&s;om to them, partly becau&s;e it is not very great, notwith&s;tanding it Snows much there, and partly becau&s;e it la&s;ts but <HI>January</HI> and <HI>February.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Several Di|&s;tempers in <HI>Persia.</HI></NOTE>By rea&s;on of this difference in the Air, there are &s;everal Places in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> le&s;s healthful than others, and the Inhabitants &s;ubject to all manner of Di|&s;tempers, and e&s;pecially in <HI>Schirman</HI> and <HI>Kilan,</HI> where Fevers and Agues much afflict them.

<HEAD>The Soil.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Nature of the Soil.</NOTE>AS to what concerns the Soil in this great circumference of Land, it is of a different Nature: for in &s;ome places it is exceed|ing fruitful, by rea&s;on of the many Rivers which water the &s;ame, e&s;pecially on the &s;ide towards the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea;</HI> the re&s;t is &s;ubject to great Drought, and hath many Wilderne&s;&s;es and craggy Moun|tains.

<P>The Soil in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> &s;pecially &s;o call'd, is very dry and &s;tonie, and therefore requires much Ma|nuring to fatten it, by which, and the Water con|vey'd in Pipes, the Fields are fertiliz'd, and pro|duce &s;everal &s;orts of Corn and Fruit in great a|bundance.</P>
<P>About the Village <HI>Becktahab,</HI> a League from <HI>I&s;pahan,</HI> the Land is barren and white, which <HI>Della Valle</HI> a&s;cribes to the Salt with which it is mix'd.</P>

But in the low Grounds, where the mo&s;t Villages are built, it is green and fertile, for the Inhabitants convey the Brooks, which are not above four or five Foot broad, and &s;pring out of the Mountains, about and through all their Lands and Gardens, which they water therewith: for (as we &s;aid be|fore) there is little Rain falls in <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> Their Fields are generally ten or twelve Rods in the &s;quare, which being &s;urrounded with Water, and inclos'd with Banks about a Foot high, they (stop|ping their Sluces, drown the &s;ame when they plea&s;e, and can let the Water out of one Trench into another; nay, oftentimes when occa&s;ion re|quires, they let their Lands lie under Water in the Night, and in the day-time drain it off again to be dry'd by the Heat of the Sun.

The <HI>Sophy</HI> and his <HI>Chans</HI> or Vice-Roys, keep &s;everal Teams of the&s;e le&s;&s;er Camels, which are employ'd either to fetch in Amba&s;&s;adors, at which time they are caparison'd with Crim&s;on Silks, and Bells, and other Ornaments about their Necks and before their Brea&s;ts, and have rich Embroider'd Saddles; or el&s;e they are us'd as we our Po&s;t-Hor&s;es, and carry Goods from Place to Place like Pack-Hor&s;es; and moreover they u&s;e them in their Wars, for if a Party chance to be defeated, they with more &s;peed convey away their Baggage; but &s;ome of them Trot &s;o hard, and as it were, Jumping, that no Man would be able to endure it long. One Man is able to ma|nage &s;even or more, for he makes them fa&s;t one be|hind another, and either rides upon, or walks be|fore the foremo&s;t. It is very convenient travel|ling in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> by the help of the&s;e Camels, for by them Merchants have their Goods carry'd at rea|&s;onable Rates; and if any Per&s;ons are not minded to travel alone,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Camels Diet.</NOTE> they go for their better &s;ecurity with the <HI>Cavila</HI> or <HI>Caravans.</HI> A Camel is for the mo&s;t part fed with Nettles, Thi&s;tles, and other Weeds. On the Thi&s;tles oftentimes breed poy|&s;onous Snails, in the Countrey Language call'd <HI>Mohere,</HI> by which if a Camel be &s;tung in the No&s;e, he dies &s;oon after; therefore when the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> are angry with them, they wi&s;h the <HI>Mo|here</HI> to &s;ting them in the No&s;e. They al&s;o mix Chaff and Barley together, and make Dough thereof in form like a long Loaf about three Pound weight, which they give them to eat: Sometimes they mix the Seed of the Cotton-Tree, which is about the bigne&s;s of a Pea&s;e, with it, which makes it very &s;weet, and with which a Camel being well fed, will travel two days with|out Drinking, which is a great Providence in Nature, becau&s;e in the Wilderne&s;&s;es and Sandy De&s;arts, through which they often travel, there is no Water to be found. The Camels of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> are (according to <HI>Della Valle</HI>) fed with Barley Meal mix'd with Straw, and made into Balls: for if they eat Gra&s;s, it debilitates them both for Travel and Service: They are very willing to take up their Loads, for &s;triking them onely on the Knees with a Switch, they immediately kneel-down, and lying with their Bellies on the Ground, &s;uffer them&s;elves to be loaden. They go much fa&s;ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">They are pleas'd with Mu&s;ick.</NOTE> and carry their Burdens with delight (as Mr. <HI>Sandis</HI> affirms) when their Drivers Whi&s;tle or Sing to them, or make them any other Mu&s;ick; wherefore the Owners of them tie two Bells above the Knee of one of their fore Legs, and a Collar of &s;mall ones about their Necks. Mr. <HI>Pur|chas</HI> relates, That the <HI>Arabians</HI> for the foremen|tion'd Rea&s;on, never travel without a Drum and Drummer through the De&s;arts. The &s;ame is ju|&s;tifi'd by <HI>Leo Africanus,</HI> who adds, That when Travellers have tir'd their Camels, they need not beat them (which they regard not) to make them go forward, but onely Sing or Whi&s;tle a plea&s;ant Tune, which &s;o animates and refre&s;hes them, that they go fa&s;ter than a Man is able to run, to the end of their Journey.</P>
<P>The&s;e Bea&s;ts have a &s;trong Memory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Are revenge|ful.</NOTE> are vin|dicative, and do not ea&s;ily forget an Injury done to them, wherefore the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> commonly &s;ay, That a revengeful Man hath a Camels Spleen. But that there &s;hould be an Antipathy betwixt a Camel and a Hor&s;e (as <HI>Xenophon</HI> writes) is a mi|&s;take, becau&s;e it is very common in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> in one <HI>Caravan</HI> to have Camels, Hor&s;es, and A&s;&s;es, which are often put in one Stable together, without offe|ring the lea&s;t hurt to one another.</P>
<P>The &s;he Camels carry their Young twelve Moneths, and do not Generate backward, as &s;ome will have it, though it be true, that when they &s;tand in the Stable they Urine backwards, which perhaps hath been the occa&s;ion of that mi&s;take; for they Couple like other Bea&s;ts, onely the Fe|male falls on her Belly.</P>
<P>Now in regard a Camel is a Bea&s;t that may be kept at a &s;mall charge, they are &s;eldom kill'd in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> except they are &s;tung by a <HI>Mohere,</HI> or fall down tir'd on the Road (as it often happens in deep Ways) and then they kill and eat them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Very good Breeds of Hor&s;es.</NOTE><HI>Per&s;ia</HI> is al&s;o &s;tor'd with plenty of good Hor&s;es, mo&s;t of them having very hand&s;om Heads, Ears, Cre&s;t and Legs. In ancient time the Province of <HI>Media</HI> was famous for breeding of excellent Hor|&s;es, which were call'd <HI>Ni&s;ean</HI> Hor&s;es, from a City of that Name; and (as <HI>Strabo</HI> tells us) the Kings of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> us'd no other.

They generally u&s;e them to Ride on, but in <HI>Mu&s;cur</HI> they al&s;o draw in Carts, for Wa|gons with four Wheels they u&s;e none. And be|cau&s;e they are great lovers of Hor&s;es and Riding, and their chiefe&s;t Force con&s;i&s;ts in their Cavalry, therefore they breed them with great care. But in &s;tead of Straw they Litter them with their own Dung, dry'd in the Sun, and &s;trew'd a Foot thick under them, on which the Hor&s;es lie as &s;oft as on Cotton; and if any of it become wet, it is taken from the re&s;t and dry'd: They cover them al&s;o with a Hair Cloth Lin'd with Wool.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have been Ma&s;ters of the&s;e excel|lent Hor&s;es &s;ince the Death of the Sultan <HI>Bori&s;ir,</HI> whom the King of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> caus'd to be put to death, after his coming from <HI>Carmania</HI> into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> with many beautiful Hor&s;es, to the number of ten thou|&s;and, of all which he made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter, and from them the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> have had &s;uch excellent Breeds, that the <HI>Turks</HI> are inferior to them.</P>

They are very cu|rious in their Furniture, and therefore Per&s;ons of Quality Embroider their Sadles, Bridles, and Cloths with Gold and Silver, which is an ancient Pride of the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> ever &s;ince the Reign of <HI>Xerxes.</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="51">The&s;e Hor&s;es, though employ'd night and day in a Battel, can endure thirty hours without Meat.</P>

Rich Merchants who Trade in divers Places in the Countrey, make a great Convenience of it; having at their Coun|trey-hou&s;es, and where el&s;e they Trade, not onely Furniture, but a Wife; &s;o that where e're they come, they are &s;till at Home.</P>
<P>They Marry their neare&s;t Relations, but not &s;o ince&s;tuou&s;ly as of old they were wont to do; for in antient times (as <HI>Bri&s;&s;onius</HI> affirms out of &s;everal Writers) they commonly married their own Mothers, Si&s;ters, or Daughters; but at this day none may marry &s;o near in Blood. Moreo|ver, it is accounted a horrid Sin, for any man to defile his Si&s;ter; which was not cu&s;tomary in <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> before <HI>Camby&s;es</HI> time; but grew very com|mon after his marrying of his own Si&s;ter, which he lov'd exceedingly.</P>

<P>Every one is free to Marry at any time in the year, except in the Moneth of <HI>Rame&s;an,</HI> or their <HI>Lent,</HI> and the ten days Mourning and Ab&s;tinence call'd <HI>A&s;hur.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cele|brating of Matrimony.</NOTE>When the Wedding is to be celebrated, the Bridegroom &s;ends the Bride the day before a pair of Pendants, Armlets, and other Ornaments, ac|cording to his Capacity, and &s;ome Provi&s;ions. After Dinner, which generally is pretty late in the Evening, the Bride, &s;et on a Hor&s;e, Camel, or Mule, with a red Silk Hood hanging down into her Lap, and accompany'd with all her Friends, Relations, and &s;everal &s;orts of Mu&s;ick, is con|ducted to the Bridegrooms Hou&s;e, where with &s;ome Women &s;he is put into a peculiar Apart|ment, and the Men into another, and Meat &s;et be|fore them, which when they have eaten, the Bride is &s;oon after carry'd into the Bed-Chamber, and the Bridegroom being brought to her, there fir&s;t at once enjoys both her Sight and Company, having never &s;een her before, and if he find her to have been vitiated, he may frely cut off her No&s;e and Ears, and turn her out of his Chamber; but if he find her a Virgin, he &s;ignifies his Joy to her old Nur&s;e and to his Friends: Then they Fea&s;t three days one after another. They al&s;o u&s;e Dan|cing, which is in Couples, but the Men by them|&s;elves in one Room, and the Women in another; the Mu&s;ick never go into the Womens Cham|ber, but &s;tand and Play at their Door. In the Evening the Leaves of <HI>Alcanna,</HI> with which they color their Hands, are laid on a Cotton Handker|chief, with two Spoonfuls of <HI>Alcanna;</HI> both which they take home with them: After which the Gue&s;ts make Pre&s;ents to the new Marry'd Couple, every one according to their Capacities.</P>
<PB N="57" REF="55">
<P>After the Wedding is over, and that the New|marry'd Couple dwell in the Brides Fathers hou&s;e, the new Wife may not be &s;een with her Face un|cover'd before her Father-in-Law, nor &s;peak with him; but if occa&s;ion require, &s;he is to ex|pre&s;s her mind by Signs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Another way to get women</NOTE>Be&s;ides their Marrying, they have another way to acquire a Companion to their Bed, <HI>viz.</HI> To hire them with a Sum of Money for a certain time; and is practi&s;ed chiefly by tho&s;e that travel from Place to Place, and by &s;uch as are not willing to be &s;een in the publick Stews.</P>
<P>A third way is by buying in the Market, &s;laves, with whom they may do what they plea&s;e. The&s;e are commonly taken by the <HI>Tage&s;tan Tartars,</HI> from the Chri&s;tians in <HI>Georgia,</HI> and &s;old to the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI> Nor is this Priviledge all allow'd onely to Men, for Women e&s;pecially of Quality may as often change their Husbands as they plea&s;e. One re|lates that two Ladies meeting upon a Vi&s;it, The one ask'd the other, How long &s;he had liv'd with her Husband? The other replied, two Moneths; how, two Moneths! &s;o long! can any Woman content her &s;elf with one Man, almo&s;t three&s;core nights?</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">To help a wo|man in Labor.</NOTE>When the Women are in labour, and cannot be &s;uddenly deliver'd; then the Relations and Neighbors run to the Schools, and give the <HI>Molla</HI> money, to &s;pare and forgive all tho&s;e Schollars that have offended, and are condemned to be whipt; which they believe to be a great means to further her &s;peedy Delivery: And for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, they think it very effectual to creep three or four times under a Camels belly.</P>
<P>If at any time, though without Cau&s;e, a Man &s;u&s;pect his Wife, they pa&s;s it not by, but take &s;peedy and &s;harp Revenge; as appears by the following Relation.</P>
<P>Some years &s;ince, in the Province of <HI>Lenkeran,</HI> dwelt a Per&s;on nam'd <HI>Jakut Tirkenam,</HI> who was the Kings Bow-bearer; his Wife being reported to be of a loo&s;e behavior; at la&s;t <HI>Schach Abbas</HI> him&s;elf heard thereof, who order'd Notice to be given to the foremention'd <HI>Tirkenam,</HI> either to reform his Hou&s;e, or el&s;e to keep out of the King's Pre&s;ence: Whereupon, he fearing to lo&s;e his Place, being of great Profit and Honor, made a real and thorow Reformation, by killing not one|ly his Wife, but four Children; and all that re|lated to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, to the number of twelve Per&s;ons; which though it &s;eem barbarous to us, yet it pre|&s;erv'd his Reputation and Employment, with the King, his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Men likewi&s;e have the Power which they often execute, that if they catch any committing Adultery with their Wives, they may either im|mediately kill both, or el&s;e bedivorc'd; and this la&s;t is very common.</P>

<HEAD>Of their Poe&s;ie.</HEAD>
<P>POe&s;ie is here al&s;o highly e&s;teem'd, for in mo&s;t places are many <HI>Shaers</HI> or Poets (for <HI>Shaer</HI> in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tongue &s;ignifies a Poet, as <HI>Ca&s;iechuan</HI> an Orator) which compo&s;e Ver|&s;es in Writing, but <HI>extempore,</HI> which they recite publickly in the <HI>Maidan</HI> or Market-place, or in Hou&s;es of Entertainment, for a &s;mall Reward, and are often invited to great Fea&s;ts by Per&s;ons of Quality, to make their Entertainment more &s;o|lemn by the rehear&s;al of their Poetical Fancies. <HI>Della Valle</HI> affirms, that they have &s;ome knowledge in Poetry, Morality, and Oratory, yet it is but &s;u|perficial, con&s;i&s;ting onely in words, for they are very &s;hallow of Invention, which is the mo&s;t no|ble part, and like the Soul of the whole Body.</P>
<P>The King, as al&s;o the <HI>Chans,</HI> have each their own Poets, which do not make them&s;elves com|mon in the Streets, but keep in their Hou&s;es, and make new Ver&s;es to delight their Lords, and if they chance to hit on a Subject plea&s;ing to them, they are rewarded with great Pre&s;ents.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The difference of their Poets</NOTE>The&s;e Poets differ from other People in their Habit, for like the Philo&s;ophers they wear white under-Coats, open before, with broad and wide Sleeves, and a Bag by their Girdle, in which they carry their Paper and Inkhorn: Their Cloaks are without Sleeves, their Stockings &s;hort, and their Breeches run down &s;loaping to their Feet: In the Winter they wear Coats which reach down to their Ancles; but they never wear <HI>Turbants,</HI> onely Caps. Tho&s;e that &s;tand in the <HI>Maidans</HI> or Mar|kets, tie a painted Cloth about their Bodies, which hang over their right Shoulder and under their left Arm, in which manner they read their Poetry; but the&s;e are not all to be &s;uppos'd excellent, for &s;ome &s;carce de&s;erve the Name of Rhimers; the&s;e may be &s;een venting their Froth in publick Hou|&s;es and in the Market-places, to the illiterate Vul|gar.

<L>Adamira demag Janitze?</L>
<L>Tzire, tzire, tzirag O&s;teri bud?</L>
<L>Adamira demag Cheri bud.</L></Q>
<P>Some begin with the ending word, and end with the beginning word of the former Line, as in the following Ver&s;es:</P>
<Q><L>Kalem be de&s;t Debira beh ha&s;ar derem,</L>
<L>Derem be de&s;t neajed Meker nauk kalem.</L></Q>
<P>Here the &s;econd Ver&s;e begins with the word wherewith the fir&s;t ended, and the la&s;t ends with the &s;ame with which the fir&s;t begins; &s;o that we may conclude, though they have a high conceit of them&s;elves, yer we can di&s;cover nothing by this, but that they are very mean Poets.</P>

<P>The Stream <HI>Fa&s;o</HI> di&s;embogues it &s;elf into the Sea through two Mouths, between which it makes an I&s;land, by the Ancients call'd <HI>Ea,</HI> wherein the <HI>Turks</HI> in the Year 1578. built a Fort, which was &s;ince pull'd down.

<P>The Lords &s;ell their Subjects for Slaves to the <HI>Turks,</HI> and the Men their Wives, whereof the chief Lord of the Soil always receives a third part, the Parents of the Women another part, and the Husband the re&s;t.</P>

Common Hou&s;es are not divided into &s;everal Apartments, but con&s;i&s;t in one large Room, in which the Ma&s;ter, Mi&s;tre&s;s, Servants, and all, both Men and Women, dwell together. They always keep a great Fire in the middle of the Hall in the Winter. The Walls of their Hou&s;es are of Wood, and the Roofs cover'd with Straw, which makes them very &s;ubject to take fire. Their Halls are generally full of Smoak, and dark, having no other Light than what comes in at the Door. They leave the&s;e Hou&s;es with great willingne&s;s, when&s;oe're they are minded to remove.</P>
<P>In the Winter they commonly goe into the Woods, where being &s;ecur'd from the &s;harp Winds, they &s;pend their time in Hunting. In the Summer they dwell on the Hills, and in the Spring and Harve&s;t they chu&s;e &s;uch places for their abode, where they may have the benefit

<P>Before Noblemens Hou&s;es are generally large Squares, &s;urrounded with Moats and Gardens, planted full of Trees; round about the Squares are built divers Lodges at a certain di&s;tance one from the other to prevent Fire; that which &s;tands next to the Entrance is call'd <HI>Ochus,</HI> where they receive all Strangers, the re&s;t &s;erving either for Cellars, Kitchins, and Wardrobes, which being &s;tronger than the re&s;t, are built in the form of a Tower. In the middle of all the&s;e Lodges or little Hou&s;es, which &s;tand round about the Garden inclo&s;ing the Square, there commonly &s;tands a Chappel, wherein they all go to Ma&s;s.</P>
<P>The common People are generally very poor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Habits.</NOTE> wearing onely a woollen Lappet about their Bo|dies, from their middle down to their Knees. Per|&s;ons of Quality Clothe them&s;elves in foreign Stuffs, but wear a Girdle cover'd with a Plate, at which they hang their Sword, and all other things which are requi&s;ite to be us'd on a Journey, <HI>viz.</HI> a Knife, a Hone, a Leather of three Inches broad, and half a Yard long, a Tinder-box, a lit|tle Bag full of Salt, and another full of Pepper and other Spices, and a Wax Candle. The Shirts which they wear are wrought with Gold at the bottom and about their Necks, and hang out over their Knees; their upper Garment is al&s;o &s;horter than their Shirts. In cold Weather they wear Furr'd Coats. Their Bonnets or Caps are &s;harp on the top. They account the <HI>European</HI> Hats an ea&s;ie and commodious Wear; but &s;ince none in that Countrey could learn to make them of Wooll, &s;ome have made them of Straw, and co|ver'd them with Sear-cloth, as al&s;o with Woollen Cloth and other Stuffs; which Hats they put on over their Bonnets or Caps in rainy Weather, or el&s;e again&s;t the heat of the Sun.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their home|ly manner of Entertain|ment.</NOTE>By rea&s;on of the poorne&s;s of the Countrey they very &s;eldom make any Fea&s;ts or great Enter|tainments; yet they live plentifully, and are very free of what they have. Among&s;t other Di&s;hes they boyl pounded Barley to a Dough, which they &s;et on a woodden Peel before their Gue&s;ts, who eat the &s;ame in&s;tead of Bread. They bring this fir&s;t to the Table, and the Per&s;on appointed for that purpo&s;e runs with it from one Man to an|other; which done, he gives another &s;ort of finer Dough to the mo&s;t noble Per&s;on on a Chip, the Cook &s;erving up the other Di&s;hes in the mean time. They never &s;et Chairs nor Stools for their Gue&s;ts, but they &s;tand round about the Table, which &s;erves them al&s;o both for Di&s;hes and Tren|chers. When they have any Spoon-meat they make a Hole in their Dough, into which they put their Broths: In &s;tead of a Table-cloth they &s;pread a Carpet of Leather, which is thirty Foot long, and &s;o grea&s;ie, that the &s;ight thereof is enough to turn a &s;queami&s;h Stomach.</P>
<P>As the&s;e People &s;pend their whole Life-time in the Field, &s;o their greate&s;t delight is Hunting, in which every one recreating him&s;elf, hath made a Proverb among&s;t them, <HI>That a Mans Happine&s;s in this World con&s;i&s;ts in a Hor&s;e, a good Dog, and a Hawk.</HI> The Prince appoints &s;et-times for Hunting, to which he invites all his Nobles.

<P>When a young Man or Suitor goes to vi&s;it his Mi&s;tre&s;s, he is oblig'd to carry &s;ome Wine and an Ox with him, with which her Parents Fea&s;t and make Merry. On the Wedding Day, if the Bi|&s;hop or Prie&s;t be not pre&s;ent to Betroth them, they go into their Cellar, a place no le&s;s reve|renc'd among&s;t the&s;e People than the Temples; the Prie&s;t holding two Garlands, and fir&s;t &s;etting one on the Bridegrooms Head, &s;ays, <HI>N.N.

The Bi|&s;hop al&s;o celebrates Ma&s;s for the Decea&s;ed, to his great benefit, getting many times five hundred Crowns. After Ma&s;s is fini&s;h'd they all give the Bi&s;hop a Treat, and new Habits to all the Prie&s;ts which attended the Funeral: for the greate&s;t Co&s;ts and Charges which they be&s;tow on any thing, is on the&s;e Solemnities.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Vedam</HI> is the Book of their Law.</NOTE>How and from whence this <HI>Brahman</HI> had his original, &s;ome of his Sect relate out of their <HI>Vedam</HI> after this manner: Before the World was created, <HI>Wi&s;tnow,</HI> that is, <HI>God,</HI> had &s;ome inclination to have a new place to recreate and delight him&s;elf in; are and that upon the Leaf of a Tree he &s;wam on the Water (for according to their opinion there was nothing but God and Water before the Creation) like a little Child, with his great Toe in his Mouth, in the form of a Circle, in te&s;timony that he is without beginning or end; and that God caus'd a Flower (in the Countrey Language call'd <HI>Temara,</HI> and by us a Water-Llliy) to grow out of his Navel, and not long after out of that this <HI>Bramma</HI> &s;prang. So &s;oon as he had receiv'd Life, he &s;tood with great admiration, and con&s;ider'd from whence lie was deriv'd, which becau&s;e he could not po&s;&s;ible find out, God declar'd it to him;
<PB N="112" REF="88">whereupon he &s;hew'd great &s;igns of thankfulne&s;s and obedience; wherewith <HI>We&s;tnow</HI> was &s;o well pleas'd, that he gave <HI>Bramma</HI> power to create the World; who thereupon created the &s;ame, and gave Life to all things in it.</P>
<P><HI>Barthruerri,</HI> an <HI>Indian</HI> Writer, in his Book of the Way to Heaven, confirms this, and &s;ays, <HI>One of great prudence and under&s;tanding created this World;</HI> and more plainly in another place, <HI>Why hath</HI> Bramma <HI>made the Mountain Merouwa?</HI> and again in another, <HI>Bramma hath made nothing in the World that is con&s;tant;</HI> by which it appears, that this is really the&s;e <HI>Pagans</HI> opinion, <HI>viz.</HI> That this <HI>Bramma</HI> was the fir&s;t Man (as they &s;ay) that by the power which God gave him, created the World, with all things therein. Yet neverthe|le&s;s few among&s;t them po&s;itively a&s;crib'd the Creation of the World to one Man, but either to God him&s;elf or his Son; whence we may &s;uppo&s;e, that the <HI>Brahmans</HI> judge their foremen|tion'd Chief to be the Head of the Angels, or the Son of God. The&s;e further affirm, that this <HI>Bramma</HI> had anciently five Heads but from the power which had been given him growing more ambitious, he attempted to defile <HI>E&s;wara, Wi&s;t|now</HI>'s Con&s;ort, which when he heard, he was &s;o enraged, that he caus'd her to bring forth the Daemon <HI>Beirewa,</HI> the chief of the Devils, who with his Claws &s;cratch'd off the middlemo&s;t Head of <HI>Bramma,</HI> as a puni&s;hment for his bold at|tempt; &s;o that he kept onely four, Heads, with which he is repre&s;ented in their <HI>Pagode:</HI> Not long after which <HI>Bramma</HI> made many Ver&s;es in prai&s;e of <HI>E&s;wara,</HI> who was &s;o delighted therewith, that &s;he promis'd to let him live in great Honor and Repute with his four Heads, and put the fifth on her own.</P>
<P>The &s;ame <HI>Bramma,</HI> as the <HI>Brahmans</HI> affirm, &s;hall in the other World &s;erve in a lower Degree; and that <HI>Annemonta,</HI> a faithful Servant to <HI>Wi&s;tnow,</HI> &s;hall enjoy his Place, all which will be inflicted on him as a puni&s;hment for his ambition.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Brahmans</HI> do not onely a&s;cribe the Creation of the World to this <HI>Bramma,</HI> but al&s;o the Government thereof; God (as they &s;ay) not once taking cogni&s;ance of it; for they alledge, that as a King will not take the trouble upon him to Govern his Realm him&s;elf, but appoint Vice-Roys or Lieutenants for that purpo&s;e; &s;o likewi&s;e God doth not concern him&s;elf with the Govern|ment of this World, but gave the Charge there|of to <HI>Bramma.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame <HI>Brathrouherri</HI> in the foremention'd Book, a&s;cribes the limitation of time which a Man is to live here on Earth to <HI>Bramma,</HI> &s;aying. <HI>The longe&s;t time which</HI> Bramma <HI>hath granted Men to live, is a hundred years;</HI> and, <HI>All things which happen to Mankind on Earth, is by the appointment of</HI> Bramma; which in his Book of good Conver&s;ation he thus expre&s;&s;es, <HI>According as</HI> Bramma <HI>de&s;igns, &s;o it &s;hall be: for it is with a Man as with the Bird</HI> Tzataca, <HI>who whether it Rains much or little, he gets not above one drop thereof:</HI> His meaning is, That though a Man &s;trive never &s;o much to rai&s;e his Fortune, it will be in vain: for whatever <HI>Bramma</HI> hath ap|pointed for him, he &s;hall attain to, and no more. The Bird <HI>Tzataca,</HI> as the <HI>Brammans</HI> relate, drinks not of the Water which falls on the Earth, but in rainy Weather holds open his Bill to receive the Drops, &s;o that whether it Rains much or little it avails not, the Bird not being able to take above a Drop at once.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Author affirms in another place, that whatever <HI>Bramma</HI> hath decreed for Man|kind, that will happen to him, and if any one be poor, it is by his appointment: <HI>For</HI> (&s;aith he) <HI>he hath appointed the Winds to feed the Serpents, and the Gra&s;s for Bea&s;ts;</HI> whereby it appears, that this <HI>Bramma</HI> is the principal, who hath &s;ome others under him, to whom he commits the care of &s;ome peculiar Places; but the&s;e are not accounted Gods, but onely <HI>Geweta's,</HI> or Angels. The mo&s;t eminent of them is a <HI>Dewendre,</HI> who bears great &s;way, and is chief over all the Heads of the eight Worlds: to &s;even whereof (they &s;ay) tho&s;e that have liv'd well here, go after their Decea&s;e, and are all commanded by <HI>Dewendre,</HI> otherwi&s;e call'd <HI>Indre,</HI> as the &s;upream Governor, be&s;ides whom every Place hath a peculiar Tutelary Angel, who Commands one of the eight Worlds, which are plac'd above the Earth. Next follow the fore|mention'd eight Worlds, lying between ours and <HI>Bramma-lokon,</HI> that is, <HI>The Re&s;idence of Bramma,</HI> the one in the North, the other in the South; the <HI>Brahmans</HI> call them as followeth, <HI>viz.</HI> the fir&s;t <HI>Indre-Lokon,</HI> where <HI>Dewendre</HI> or <HI>Indre</HI> hath his Re&s;idence; the &s;econd, <HI>Achmi-Lokon;</HI> the third, <HI>Jamma-Lokon,</HI> which is Hell, wherein the Wick|ed are puni&s;h'd; the fourth, <HI>Niauti-Lokon;</HI> the fifth, <HI>Warronna-Lokon;</HI> the &s;ixth, <HI>Cubera-Lokon;</HI> the &s;eventh, <HI>Wajouvia;</HI> and the eighth, <HI>I&s;angja-Lokon:</HI> But the&s;e Worlds are not &s;uch as we in|habit, onely places of happine&s;s like the <HI>Ely&s;ian</HI> Fields.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the care which the&s;e Governors have of their peculiar Places, they have other Concerns to look after, <HI>viz. Achmi</HI> hath the Charge over the Fire; <HI>Warrouna</HI> commands the Waters; <HI>Wa|jouvia,</HI> the Wind; <HI>Cubera,</HI> Riches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Some account this <HI>Bramma</HI> to be the &s;ame with <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> and accordingly the <HI>Brahmans</HI> have &s;ome Books, which they firmly believe to be <HI>Py|thagoras</HI>'s own Works, which agrees with what <HI>Jarchas</HI> (according to <HI>Philo&s;tratus</HI>) told <HI>Apollonius Thyaneus, viz.</HI> That the <HI>Indians</HI> believ'd that which <HI>Pythagoras</HI> taught them concerning the Soul, and in&s;tructed the <HI>Egyptians</HI> therein. But <HI>Diogenes Laertius,</HI> who writ the Life of <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> makes mention in no place, that ever he was in <HI>In|dia,</HI> or that he had any acqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">antance with the <HI>Brah|mans;</HI> therefore it is to be &s;uppos'd, that if <HI>Py|thagoras</HI> hath taught the <HI>Indians</HI> any thing of his Doctrine, he did it not him&s;elf, but by his Books, that perhaps were brought into the&s;e Countreys.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;everal Sects of the <HI>Brahmans.</HI></NOTE>The&s;e <HI>Brahmans</HI> differing among&s;t them&s;elves, are divided into &s;ix &s;everal Sects, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Wi&s;t|nowa, Sciva, Smarta, Scharwacka, Pa&s;inda,</HI> and <HI>T&s;checktea,</HI> which have each their peculiar Fol|lowers. The <HI>Wi&s;tnowa's</HI> account <HI>Wi&s;tnow</HI> the &s;u|pream God, and none equal to him, and from him they take their Denomination.</P>
<P>This Sect is again divided into two, the one call'd <HI>Tadwadi Wi&s;tnowa,</HI> or <HI>Madwa Wi&s;tnowa,</HI> and the othe <HI>Ramanouja Wi&s;tnowa. Tadwadi</HI> &s;ignifies a Di&s;puter, and <HI>Tadwa</HI> Knowledge of God: for the Followers thereof are accounted great Di&s;puters, knowing how to di&s;cour&s;e of God and all his Works, firmly maintaining all their Arguments. The Name <HI>Madwa</HI> is deriv'd from one <HI>Madway A&s;|jaria,</HI> who (as they &s;ay) was the fir&s;t Promoter and Rai&s;er of this Sect; as al&s;o the Name of <HI>Ram|nouja,</HI> from one <HI>Ramanouja Asjarr,</HI> the Promoter of the Sect <HI>Ramanouja, Wi&s;tnowa.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>We&s;tnowa's</HI> have each a peculiar way and
<PB N="113" REF="88">manner to know one another.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ceremonies of the <HI>Tad|wadi&s;tes</HI></NOTE> The <HI>Tadwadi&s;tes</HI> mark them&s;elves daily with a white Stroak, which from their Forehead comes down their No&s;e, and with a round Circle about the bigne&s;s of a Groat on their Temples, as al&s;o the upper part of the Arms near the Shoulder, and on both Brea&s;ts, which they &s;ay is the work of <HI>Wi&s;tnow,</HI> and &s;erves as a Shield to defend them again&s;t the Devil and <HI>Jamma,</HI> the infernal Judge, that they dare not touch nor approach them.</P>
<P>They make Promi&s;es to <HI>Wi&s;tnow,</HI> to acknow|ledge him for the onely God, to whom they owe Reverence and Obedience; neither do they think it &s;ufficient to make the foremention'd Pro|mi&s;e, but they mu&s;t always lead a pious and vertu|ous Life.</P>
<P>They are under one &s;upream Head, who dwells up in the Countrey near the City <HI>Pallacatta,</HI> in a Place call'd <HI>Combeconne:</HI> He wears not the Cord call'd <HI>T&s;andhan</HI> about his Neck, as the other <HI>Brah|mans,</HI> neither hath he a Wife, but upon his entring into that Office he for&s;akes all worldly things, and commonly walks with a Cane in his Hand.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Rama|nouja's</HI> Te|nets.</NOTE>The <HI>Ramanouja Wi&s;tnowa's</HI> mark them&s;elves with a Sign in form like the <HI>Greek</HI> Letter <HI>Yp&s;ilon, viz.</HI> they begin from their No&s;es upwards to their Foreheads, which is done with a Stuff like Whi|ting or Chalk. They al&s;o burn another Mark in their Fle&s;h under their Armpits, which &s;ome ac|count &s;ufficient, thinking it needle&s;s to mark all their Limbs every day. This Sect think it enough when they have once with an upright Heart pro|mis'd their God to be his Servants, and believe, that though they live wickedly all their days af|ter, God will be merciful to them for that Promi&s;e &s;ake; that <HI>Wi&s;tnow</HI> will never for&s;ake tho&s;e he once hath receiv'd into his favor, alledging, that a Father will not kill his Child, though it offend, that a Man cannot live without &s;in, and therefore it is impo&s;&s;ible that <HI>Wi&s;tnow</HI> &s;hould ca&s;t off tho&s;e whom once he lov'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ramanouja's Wi&s;tnowa's</HI> mu&s;t go bare|headed, with &s;hort Hair, except one Lock on the top of their Heads, which in a Knot hangs down their Neck. The &s;upream Head of this Sect, who re&s;ides in the City <HI>Causjewaram,</HI> in the King|dom of <HI>Carmatica,</HI> may from a peculiar Priviledge, wear a Cloth about his Head, yet not always, but onely when he &s;peaks with any body.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ramanouja's</HI> e&s;teem their Sect to be better than that of the <HI>Tadwadi&s;tes,</HI> becau&s;e they are no Traders, nor frequent Hou&s;es of publick Enter|tainments.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Sect of the <HI>Brahmans</HI> is call'd <HI>Sei|via,</HI> or <HI>Ardhiha;</HI> the Followers thereof believe one <HI>E&s;wara</HI> to be the &s;upream God, making all other Deities inferior to him, nay, <HI>Wi&s;tnow</HI> him&s;elf. They make two or three Stroaks with the A&s;hes of burn'd Cow-dung on their Foreheads. Some al&s;o wear a certain Stone call'd <HI>Lingama</HI> about their Necks, others in the Hair of their Heads, in te&s;timony that they put their whole confidence in <HI>E&s;wara,</HI> and acknowledge no other God but him. Their Children al&s;o wear this Stone cover'd with Wax at a String ty'd about their Arms, when they come to be eight or ten years of age.</P>
<P>The third Sect is call'd <HI>Smarta,</HI> who&s;e Promo|ter was <HI>Sancra Atsjaria;</HI> the Followers of whom account <HI>Wi&s;tnow</HI> and <HI>E&s;wara</HI> to be one and the &s;ame, though they wor&s;hip them in two &s;everal Shapes. They wear no outward Marks of di&s;tin|ction. Among&s;t the common People this Sect is not much e&s;teem'd, and therefore hath not very many Followers, becau&s;e their Opinion is &s;ome|what above the Vulgars apprehen&s;ion, as to the Deity of the two foremention'd Gods.</P>
<P>The fourth Sect is call'd <HI>Scharwaka;</HI> the Fol|lowers whereof, after the opinion of the <HI>Epicure|ans,</HI> believe no Life after this; and whatever others alledge to demon&s;trate it, they deny, and will not be convinc'd without a peculiar Demon|&s;tration.</P>
<P>The fifth Sect is call'd <HI>Pa&s;enda,</HI> the Followers whereof affirm, that the Doctrine taught among&s;t the <HI>Heathens</HI> is irrational and &s;encele&s;s, and there|fore they regard it not, but onely mind their Bel|lies, and let all things run at random, belie|ving al&s;o with the <HI>Scharwaka's,</HI> that the Soul of a Man dies with his Body: <HI>For how</HI> (&s;ay they) <HI>is it po&s;&s;ible, that the Body of a Man, being burnt to A&s;hes, &s;hould ever come to life again?</HI> But this Argument they maintain not again&s;t the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Belief of the Re&s;urrection of the Dead (of which they have no knowledge,) but contradict the <HI>Heathens</HI> Opi|nion herein, who &s;et down a certain time, after the expiration of which all things &s;hall be as they are now.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annus Plato|nicus.</NOTE> This Opinion was held by <HI>Plato</HI> and others, who make the time to be thirty &s;ix thou|&s;and years.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pa&s;enda's</HI> are by the <HI>Brahmans</HI> e&s;teem'd wor&s;e than tho&s;e of the fourth Sect, not onely for this their Opinion, but al&s;o becau&s;e like Bea&s;ts they make no di&s;tinction between Father and Mother, Brother and Si&s;ter. They eat with all Men, and &s;leep by any Women, alledging, that in the Per&s;on of another Woman they lie with their own Wives, and for a good Name among&s;t Men they regard it not; yet they are afraid to di&s;pute their Opinion with the other Sects, as fearing they &s;hould &s;uffer Death, for the other be|ing provok'd with indignation again&s;t their wick|ed and abominable manner of living, would cer|tainly fall upon, and kill them, as hath often hap|ned, to the ruine and de&s;truction of many of the&s;e Athei&s;ts.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth Sect call'd <HI>T&s;chectea,</HI> neither Believe in <HI>Wi&s;tnow</HI> nor <HI>E&s;wara,</HI> but acknowledge one <HI>T&s;checti</HI> for the &s;upream God, from whom they af|firm <HI>Wi&s;tnow, E&s;wara,</HI> and <HI>Bramma</HI> to have had their original, and al&s;o their power; and likewi&s;e that the World and all things in the &s;ame proceeded and had their Being from him.</P>
<P>The&s;e three la&s;t Sects being by the <HI>Brahmans</HI> accounted &s;uper&s;titious, have but few Followers of their wicked Opinions.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e <HI>Brahmans</HI> who by their retir'd way of living are &s;eparated from the others, are call'd <HI>Jaques.</HI> All other People that live &s;o retiredly, are either the <HI>Wanapra&s;ta's,</HI> or <HI>Sanja&s;ies,</HI> or <HI>Ava|doutes.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Wanapra&s;ta's</HI> go with their Wives and Children into the Wood, where they live on Roots and Fruits, without doing any kind of Labor.</P>
<P>Some are of &s;o &s;crupulous a Con&s;cience, that they will not pluck the lea&s;t Root out of the Ground, fearing to &s;in, and be the occa&s;ion of di|&s;turbing a tran&s;migrated Soul, which perhaps might be in the &s;ame.</P>
<P>This kind of living in the Woods is among&s;t them accounted a great piece of Religion, and the Maintainers thereof look'd upon as a very holy People.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sanja&s;ies</HI> are a People that pretend to de|&s;pi&s;e
<PB N="114" REF="89">the World and all earthly things, and are much more retir'd than the <HI>Wanapra&s;ta's,</HI> and are not permitted to Marry, to chew <HI>Betel,</HI> or eat and drink above once a day, and then not out of Cop|per, but earthen Ve&s;&s;els: Moreover, they live on the Alms of others.

<P>When they intend to go a Journey, they often &s;et out before their time, if a good Day or fortu|nate Hour happens: And that they may the bet|ter know the&s;e times exactly, they have Books written after the manner of our Almanacks, which they call <HI>Panjangam,</HI> and are of two &s;everal &s;orts; the one made by a <HI>Braha&s;peti,</HI> Teacher to the <HI>Dewetaes;</HI> the other by <HI>Succra,</HI> Tutor to the <HI>Raets|jasjaes,</HI> that is, <HI>The Chief of Devils.</HI> The fir&s;t in|&s;tructs, That &s;ome Days are good, and &s;ome half good; as al&s;o &s;ome Hours.

<P>They all account it a good Omen when the Bird <HI>Garrouda</HI> (which is a reddi&s;h Hawk, with a white Circle about his Neck) or the Bird <HI>Pala,</HI> flie from their right to their left &s;ide, or before them as they walk: But the contrary in other Birds; for if they flie before them cro&s;s the way, from the left hand to the right, it is a good &s;ign; and a bad one, if from the right to the left. If
<PB N="119" REF="91">any be touch'd by Jackdaw (of which there are many here in this Countrey) flying, it is a very bad Omen; and they certainly believe, that ei|ther the Party which is to touch'd, or &s;ome of his Relations will infallibly die within &s;ix Weeks. To Sneeze as they travel is accounted very ill, in&s;omuch that if it happen in any Hou&s;e, they will &s;urely turn back.

If &s;he be of the Family of the <HI>Settrea's</HI> or <HI>Soudra's,</HI> then &s;he carries a Lemmon in one Hand, and a Looking-gla&s;s in the other; but if of the <HI>Brahmans</HI> or <HI>Weinsja's</HI> Tribe, onely a few red Flowers, &s;uch as they &s;trew in the <HI>Pagodes</HI> on their Idols, and have already been Offer'd to them. Coming to the place where her Husband is to be burn'd, &s;he fir&s;t go's to a Pool of Water to wa&s;h her &s;elf, giving away her Jewels, if &s;he hath any; after which a <HI>Brahman</HI> &s;ays a Prayer; this done, and the Woman having put on a yellow Garment, &s;he goes with great joy to the place from whence &s;he is to leap into the Fire, which is made of glowing Coals in a deep Pit; and that &s;he may not be terrifi'd with the &s;ight of the Fire, they put Mats quite round to prevent her looking into it.</P>
<P>At the &s;ide of the Pit is a little ri&s;ing A&s;cent made, on which &s;he &s;its down again&s;t the Mats, and takes leave of her Relations and Friends, who &s;till encourage her Undertaking.

<P>Thus the Women of the <HI>Settrean, Weinsja's</HI> and <HI>Soudrean</HI> Tribes come to their ends; but tho&s;e of the <HI>Brahmans</HI> endure far greater pain, <HI>viz.</HI> they leap not into the Fire, but are laid on a Pyle of Wood by their dead Husbands, as if they were to &s;leep by them; then they lay over them a great heap, leaving onely their Heads bare, on which they pour Oyl, and other &s;uch combu&s;tible &s;tuff.</P>

<P>After this Marriage and Ceremonies are per|form'd, the Bea&s;ts are led home again, accompa|nied with a great number of Men, Women, and Children, who make a Fea&s;t. <HI>Texeira</HI> tells us, That a <HI>Benjan</HI> Merchant &s;pent 12000 Ducats at the Marriage of his Cow with a Bull of his Neighbors.</P>
<P>Moreover, at &s;ome Sea&s;ons they have a Cu&s;tom to feed their Cows with unthre&s;h'd Rice; which done, they wa&s;h their Dung in a Sieve, and dry tho&s;e Corns which are undige&s;ted, and remain in the Sieve; which Corns being afterwards con&s;e|crated by the Prie&s;t, are accounted holy, and being made into Cakes, and bak'd, are given to &s;ick People for a wonderful Medicine.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why the <HI>In|dians</HI> have Cows in great e&s;teem.</NOTE>The <HI>Indians</HI> &s;hew this great reverence to a Cow for three &s;pecial Rea&s;ons. The fir&s;t is, Be|cau&s;e they believe, that the Souls of the Pious, which have liv'd ju&s;tly, and &s;uch as God will not puni&s;h in this World, are tran&s;migrated into the&s;e Bea&s;ts. Secondly, Becau&s;e, with the <HI>Mahume|tans,</HI> they believe, That the Foundation of the World is &s;upported onely on the Horns of the&s;e Bea&s;ts, by them call'd <HI>Behemoth,</HI> which name they have taken out of <HI>Job;</HI> and that when the Cow moves any fa&s;ter than ordinary, it occa&s;ions Earth|quakes. Thirdly, When <HI>Mahadeu,</HI> being on a time highly incens'd by rea&s;on of the many &s;ins which the People had committed, had re&s;olv'd to de&s;troy the World, a Cow appea&s;ing him, ob|tain'd Pardon for all their &s;ins, and deliver'd the World from utter ruine.</P>
<P>Moreover, this their ab&s;taining from Fle&s;h, and from killing of Bea&s;ts, the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;eem to have &s;uck'd out of <HI>Pythagoras</HI>'s Doctrine, if it was not cu&s;tomary among&s;t them before; for <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> after the &s;ame manner, and by rea&s;on he believ'd the Tran&s;migration of Souls, forbade al&s;o his Scholars to eat Fle&s;h.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Brah|mans</HI> forbid the eating of Fle&s;h, and why.</NOTE>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> al&s;o maintain, That the eating of Fle&s;h is not to be allow'd, becau&s;e it cannot be done without forcing the Soul from the Body, which they account a horrid &s;in.

But the <HI>Brahmans</HI> an&s;wer, That they by the pulling of many Herbs out of the Ground, do not &s;in &s;o much as the <HI>Settrea's</HI> by killing of one Goat; becau&s;e the Souls which re&s;ide in Herbs are in the meane&s;t condition, and by their tran&s;migation remove into nobler Bodies, as Men or Bea&s;ts.

<P>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> are very moderate in their Diet, and have no peculiar Dainties; nor do they u&s;e to drink Wine, or any other &s;trong Liquor; but their common Drink is clear Water, without any kind of mixture: yet &s;ometimes, with great de|light, they drink a Draught of Milk at Meals, with which to &s;upply them mo&s;t People of Note keep Cows.</P>

<P>The wild Fowl which keep in the Water they catch after a &s;ubtil manner, <HI>viz.</HI> a Man going into he Water with an artificial Bird of the &s;ame kind which he de&s;igns to take, imitates its Voice, whil'&s;t he &s;wims under Water in &s;uch a manner, that the artificial Bird being on the Crown of his Head, appears ju&s;t above the Water, by which means coming near the Birds, he pulls them down by the Legs, and takes as many of them as he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>As to what concerns their Pa&s;time within their Hou&s;es, they have Cards, though differing from ours in the Pictures, and in the number; they al&s;o are expert in playing at Draughts.

They Hunt <HI>Gazelles</HI> with tame Leopards after this manner: When they di&s;cover a Herd of <HI>Gazelles</HI> (for they commonly graze five or &s;ix in a compa|ny) they unchain the Leopard, that lay Chain'd in a little Wagon where they are kept; he being let loo&s;e, doth not immediately run at them, but goes creeping along to hide him&s;elf, till the <HI>Gazel|les</HI> pa&s;&s;ing by, he leaps with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s upon them, and &s;eizing one of them, &s;trangles the &s;ame, &s;atisfying him&s;elf by onely &s;ucking the Blood, and tearing out the Heart and Liver; but if he mi&s;&s;es his prey, which often happens, then he &s;tands &s;till, very well knowing it to be in vain to run after them, becau&s;e they are much &s;wifter than him&s;elf: When the Game is ended, the Keeper approaches by Degrees, &s;troaks the Leo|pard, and throwing the Fle&s;h to him, blinds his Eyes, putting on his Chain, and &s;o conveys him into the Wagon again.</P>
<P>The catching of the <HI>Nilgaux,</HI> or grey Oxen, which are a kind of Buffalo's, is of no great diffi|culty: for they &s;urround them with a &s;trong Net, which they clo&s;e by degrees, and having brought them into a narrow compa&s;s, the King, with his <HI>Omrahs</HI> and Husbandmen &s;tepping in, kill them as they plea&s;e, either by throwing Darts at them, or with Bullets, Arrows, and Swords, and in &s;uch great numbers, that the King &s;ends whole Quar|ters thereof for Pre&s;ents to his <HI>Omrahs.</HI></P>

But &s;ome Lyons have often been known to leap over the Net, to the de&s;truction of many People. The <HI>Indians</HI> account it a good Omen when the King kills a Lyon, and a very bad one when he mi&s;&s;es him, believing the whole State to be in danger if he doth not de&s;troy him. They al&s;o u&s;e great Ceremony at the end of this Hunting: for the dead Lyon is brought before the King in pre|&s;ence of all the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> who after they have ex|actly view'd and mea&s;ur'd it, give an account thereof to the Secretary to Regi&s;ter the &s;ame, <HI>viz.</HI> That &s;uch a King, at &s;uch a time, kill'd a Lyon of &s;uch a bigne&s;s, and &s;uch colour'd Hair, and having Teeth and Claws of &s;uch a length, and all other Circum&s;tances whatever.</P>

<HEAD>The Creation of the World in Ten Bodily Appearances of <HI>Wi&s;tnow,</HI> or <HI>Mahadeu.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Creation of the World.</NOTE>THe Creation of the World (as we have already mention'd) the <HI>Brahmans</HI> a&s;cribe to one <HI>Bramma,</HI> by the Power given him from <HI>Wi&s;tnow,</HI> or <HI>Mahadeu:</HI> But the&s;e People re&s;t not in the making of one; for they form di|vers imaginary Worlds, which in the form of an Egg drive on the Water, which being without the Principal World, is God him&s;elf, as &s;hall be declared hereafter more at large.</P>
<P>Some have not &s;tuck to affirm. That <HI>Bramma</HI> made fourteen Worlds, agreeing with the Parts of Humane Bodies; <HI>viz.</HI> the fir&s;t, and uppermo&s;t Cele&s;tial World, out of the Brain; the &s;econd, out of the Eyes; the third, out of the Mouth; the fourth, out of the Left Ear; the fifth, out of the Roof of the Mouth; the &s;ixth, out of the Heart; the &s;eventh, out of the Belly; the eighth, out of the Privities; the ninth, out of the Left Thigh; the tenth, out of the Knees; the ele|venth, out of the Legs; the twelfth, out of the Toes of the Right Foot; the thirteenth, out of the Toes of the Left Foot; and the fourteenth, out of the Air round about him. Out of the&s;e Worlds he al&s;o created Man, according to the qualities of Humane Bodies: <HI>viz.</HI> Out of the fir&s;t he created Men with Prudence and Under|&s;tanding; out of the &s;econd, with Conduct in Tran&s;itory things; out of the third, good Ora|tors; out of the fourth, &s;ubtile and crafty People; out of the fifth, Gluttons and debauch'd Per&s;ons; out of the &s;ixth, Noble and Famous Men; out of the &s;eventh, Slovens and Ill-natur'd: out of the eighth, La&s;civious and Venerial Humori&s;ts; out of the ninth, Handicrafts and Husband-men; out of the tenth, Gard'ners and Ru&s;ticks; out of the eleventh, poor Laborers; out of the twelfth, Murderers, Robbers, and Thieves; out of the thirteenth, Oppre&s;&s;ors of the Poor; and out of the fourteenth, People endued with all manner of excellent qualities.</P>
<P>In this manner they de&s;cribe the great <HI>Bramma,</HI> Creator of &s;o many People and Worlds; which they believe &s;o firmly in every particular, that they repre&s;ent his Image in all their <HI>Pagodes</HI> or Temples, with a Circle on every of the fore|mention'd Parts, in &s;tead of a World.</P>
<P>The World (as we &s;aid before) they affirm to drive on the Waters in the form of an Egg, which inclo&s;es Heaven, Earth, and Hell.</P>
<P>In this Egg they al&s;o know how to find the fourteen Parts of the World. Under the Earth they place <HI>Patalam,</HI> that is, <HI>The Infernal Pit;</HI> above it, the <HI>Surgam,</HI> that is, <HI>Heaven,</HI> or <HI>Brammar-Lokon;</HI> and above that, <HI>Kailo&s;om, Lilaweicontam,</HI> and <HI>Weicontam;</HI> in which three la&s;t Places, they &s;ay, God him&s;elf re&s;ides. The Earth, or Globe of the World which we inhabit, they call <HI>Boulocon.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Boulocon,</HI> &s;ay they, comprehends &s;even Worlds more, each &s;eparated from the other by a Sea. The World &s;eated at the Center, they &s;ay, is &s;urrounded with a Sea of clear, &s;weet Water; the next to it, with a Sea of Milk, on which they make the Mountain <HI>Tricoweta</HI> &s;tand, which is 10000 Leagues high and as many broad; the third, with a Sea of Butter; the fourth, with a Sea of <HI>Tayer,</HI> or Cream; the fifth, with a Sea of Wine; the &s;ixth, with a Sea of Syrrup; the &s;eventh, with a Sea of Salt Water, which is our World; all which have their Names from tho&s;e Seas which &s;urround them.</P>
<P>According to others, there are &s;even Seas in this our World alone, <HI>viz.</HI> one of Water, one of Milk, one of Cream, one of Butter, one of Salt, one of Sugar, and one of Wine.</P>

<P><HI>MAhadeu,</HI> in the fir&s;t Age, had plac'd a <HI>Ragia Inder</HI> in Heaven, to Govern the happy Souls, as a Reward for his pious Life and continual Offerings, which whil'&s;t he liv'd on Earth he made every day in honor of <HI>Ma|hadeu,</HI> with promi&s;e mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">over, that he &s;hould enjoy that place till &s;ome body el&s;e &s;hould exceed him: for he had made a hundred <HI>Siasjas,</HI> which are co&s;tly Offerings, in honor of <HI>Mahadeu;</HI> and be&s;ides all that, for&s;ook his E&s;tate, Wife and Children, nay, his own Life, and &s;pent all his time in Fa&s;ting and Praying.</P>
<P>Moreover, in this &s;econd Age was born a <HI>Bell Ragia,</HI> who growing up to a Youth, betook him|&s;elf to the reading of holy Books, and among&s;t many other things read, that a King was plac'd in Heaven to Govern the happy Souls, till &s;uch time as &s;ome one &s;hould exceed him, as above&s;aid.

This <HI>Reneka,</HI> Con&s;ort to <HI>Si|amdichemi,</HI> had a Si&s;ter who was Marry'd to a powerful <HI>Ragia,</HI> call'd <HI>Si&s;traer&s;im,</HI> with a thou&s;and mighty Arms. <HI>Siamdichemi</HI> and <HI>Reneka</HI> going both to a great Wood lying near the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> there built a Straw Hut, where they re&s;olv'd to lead a religious Life, and feed on nothing but the Fruits of the Field and Trees; thus &s;pending their time in Praying without ce&s;&s;ation, they ob|tain'd from <HI>Mahadeu</HI> power to rai&s;e the Dead to life again. Not long after, <HI>Reneka</HI> (according to <HI>Mahadeu</HI>'s Promi&s;e) was impregnated, and bore a beautiful Son, which &s;he call'd <HI>Pra&s;&s;eram,</HI> whom they in&s;tructed in all pious Exerci&s;es, and brought him up very religiou&s;ly, in&s;omuch that by the twelfth year of his age he under&s;tood the my&s;teri|ous meaning of all tho&s;e things which his Father read to him, and could readily explain them.

The mighty <HI>Ragia Si&s;traer&s;im</HI> could not admire &s;ufficiently from whence all the Riches, Clothes, Meat and Drink was brought: for that which <HI>Siamdichemi</HI> had already expended, amounted to a very great Sum of Money, his Hou&s;e or Hut not being able to contain a third part of the Goods, which he had di&s;tributed among&s;t them; where|fore the <HI>Ragia</HI> &s;uppos'd that the Hut &s;tood over a deep Pit, out of which all things were brought, and to di&s;cover it he &s;ent Spyes, who looking through a Crevi&s;s, &s;aw the foremention'd Cow, which vomited all the&s;e things out of her Mouth; which they told <HI>Ragia;</HI> who taking his leave the next day, and being ask'd by <HI>Si&s;traer&s;im</HI> if he had receiv'd &s;atisfaction in his Entertainment, and if he de&s;ir'd ought el&s;e? <HI>Ragia</HI> reply'd, <HI>Nothing but the white Cow which is in your Hut;</HI> which exceed|ingly troubled him, and being amaz'd, an&s;wer'd, That &s;he was none of his own, and therefore he could not give her away: <HI>How!</HI> (&s;aid <HI>Si&s;traer&s;im</HI>) <HI>Do you now refu&s;e to give me this Cow, whenas you have given me &s;o many excellent things before?</HI> To which <HI>Siamdichemi</HI> reply'd, <HI>The other was in my power, but this is not.</HI> To which <HI>Si&s;traer&s;im</HI> an|&s;wer'd, <HI>Do you not know my might and power, that though you refu&s;e me the Cow, I can immediately take her away by force?</HI> and immediately calling his Men together, commanded the &s;toute&s;t to take away the Cow from <HI>Siamdichemi,</HI> who &s;eeing her thus pull'd away, cry'd aloud, <HI>Whether do you go? how &s;hall I pacifie</HI> Ragia Inder? <HI>do not &s;uffer your &s;elf to be thus carry'd away for a &s;poil, but take revenge at once of yours and my Enemies.</HI> The Cow hearing the&s;e words, and being provok'd thereby, imme|diately became thrice as big as &s;he was before, and
<PB N="140" REF="107">began to trample and to pu&s;h down many of them, in&s;omuch that &s;everal thou&s;ands were kill'd, ei|ther by her Horns, or el&s;e trodden to death under her Feet; after which &s;he immediately fled to the Habitation of <HI>Ragia Inder. Si&s;traer&s;im</HI> &s;eeing &s;uch a de&s;truction made among&s;t his Followers, and the Cow out of his power flown into the Skie, believ'd that his Brother-in-law had pri|vately utter'd &s;ome conjuring words, which made the Cow do him &s;o much mi&s;chief, therefore be|ing highly incens'd, &s;aid to his Attendants, <HI>Come, let us all go back to the cur&s;ed Hut of</HI> Siamdichemi, <HI>for I will not depart hence, till I have reveng'd my &s;elf by his Death:</HI> Accordingly they with all their force fell upon his Hut, and as a Reward for all his kindne&s;s in Entertaining him and his Retinue for three days together, and giving him &s;o many rich Pre&s;ents, mo&s;t cruelly and ungratefully beat out his Brains. The unfortunate <HI>Reneka</HI> &s;eeing her beloved Husband thus inhumanely murther'd, fetch'd the Corps into her Hut, where laying the &s;ame in her Lap, &s;he re&s;olv'd not to live long after him, but &s;etting fire on the Hut, burnt her &s;elf, and mix'd her A&s;hes with tho&s;e of her Husbands. Mean while the Cow coming near <HI>Ragia Inder</HI>'s Habitation, met with <HI>Pra&s;&s;eram,</HI> who asking her from whence &s;he came, was told, That upon <HI>Ra|gia Inder</HI>'s Command &s;he had been at his Father's Hou&s;e; and al&s;o related what had hapned there, <HI>viz.</HI> how ill <HI>Si&s;traer&s;im</HI> had rewarded his Father for his extraordinary kindne&s;s, and how treache|rou&s;ly he was murther'd: Whereupon <HI>Pra&s;&s;eram</HI> an&s;wer'd, <HI>Let me die, if I do not revenge this one and twenty times over, and de&s;troy all the Ketteries;</HI> now the <HI>Ketteries</HI> were a very wicked People, de&s;troy|ing more pious <HI>Brahmans</HI> than ever the Giants and Deities had done.

At la&s;t opening her poy&s;onous Bo&s;om, &s;he laid the Infant <HI>Ki&s;na</HI> to the &s;ame, hoping that it would there breathe its la&s;t; but the Child &s;trengthned by, <HI>Mahadeu</HI>'s Power again&s;t all Poy&s;ons, taking the Nipple into its Mouth, not onely &s;uck'd away all her Milk, but the Blood out of her Veins, and al&s;o her Soul; and by that means immediately growing cold and &s;tiff, &s;he fell down dead: Which when King <HI>Cans</HI> heard, he grew exceeding &s;or|rowful, practi&s;ing divers ways to de&s;troy the In|fant <HI>Ki&s;na,</HI> but all in vain; for, growing up in years, he for a time became a Herd&s;man, and under that form wrought many &s;trange Miracles, too tedious to in&s;ert: And, among&s;t others, when the la&s;t Hour of his Altar was come, he went out of <HI>Dowarca,</HI> and taking up a handful of Dirt, threw the &s;ame over the City, by which means all the Golden Roofs, Streets, and &s;tately Stru|ctures, became nothing but Hay, Clay, Wood, and Stones.

<P>In many places the <HI>Pagodes</HI> are built in the Fields, and are without Windows or Holes, &s;o that no Light comes into them but through the Doors, &s;o that they are generally very dark; they are commonly divided into three Walks, the fir&s;t being a Vault re&s;ting on Stone Columns, into which any one may come, it being always open: In it are &s;everal Statues of Elephants, Oxen, Hor|&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are us'd in the Service of the Idol, who is often drawn upon them through the Streets of the Cities.

The Name <HI>Mahadeu</HI> a|mong&s;t the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;ignifies properly <HI>Great God,</HI> who&s;e Vertues they highly extol, believing him to be very wonderful, adding moreover, that whil'&s;t he liv'd on Earth, he daily grew bigger and bigger, nay, that his Image &s;till grows greater as it &s;tands in their Temples.</P>
<P>They al&s;o repre&s;ent <HI>Mahadeu</HI> in another Shape, of Cry&s;tal, and make Offerings at his Fet, which con&s;i&s;t in Milk, Oyl, Rice, and the like. They al|&s;o repre&s;ent him like a Man, but having &s;ixteen Arms on each &s;ide.</P>

<P>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> account their <HI>Pagodes</HI> to be the Hou&s;es and Re&s;idences of their Gods, and there|fore enter into them with great Reverence.

They al&s;o go in Pilgrimage to the <HI>Pagodes,</HI> and upon certain Fea&s;t-days make great Pre&s;ents and Offerings to them.</P>
<P>The Pagode <HI>Winket E&s;wara</HI> in the City <HI>Tripeti,</HI> hath yearly three Feafts; one in <HI>September,</HI> at which time great numbers of People flock thither from all parts of the Countrey, e&s;pecially the <HI>Soudra's,</HI> who commonly carry many Pre&s;ents with

Towards the Evening they carry the Image home again through the Streets, ac|company'd with abundance of People carrying lighted Torches, and at la&s;t &s;et it in the old place.

<P>They affirm, that it is &s;ufficient for the Vulgar to die onely in the holy Places, from whence they undoubtedly go to Heaven.</P>
<P>The&s;e Places have each their Limits, but are not of an equal bigne&s;s: for that of <HI>Ca&s;i</HI> is but a Mile; that of <HI>Ayot-ja,</HI> twelve Leagues; and not|with&s;tanding they account it a happine&s;s to die in one of them, yet none are allow'd, out of a long|ing de&s;ire of Salvation, to bereave them&s;elves of life there, except at <HI>Preyaga,</HI> of which more here|after. As to what concerns the&s;e Places in parti|cular, they are de&s;crib'd after this manner:</P>
<P><HI>Ayot-ja,</HI> lying twelve Leagues Northward from <HI>Ca&s;i,</HI> was the Birth-place of <HI>Wi&s;tnow</HI> under the Name of <HI>Ram.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Matura</HI> near <HI>Agra,</HI> the <HI>Great Mogol</HI>'s Court, <HI>Wi&s;tnow</HI> came into the World by the Name of <HI>Cri&s;tna.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ca&s;i,</HI> otherwi&s;e call'd <HI>Warana&s;i,</HI> lying in <HI>Bengala</HI> near the Kiver <HI>Ganges,</HI> twelve Leagues from <HI>Ayot-ja,</HI> and twelve from <HI>Preyaga,</HI> is &s;ituate twelve Leagues higher up the <HI>Ganges</HI> then <HI>Ca&s;i,</HI> and nearer to the City <HI>Agra,</HI> where three Branches of the <HI>Ganges</HI> uniting, are accounted &s;o holy, that the <HI>Heathens</HI> believe tho&s;e which die in this Water to be certainly purg'd from their &s;ins; and therefore this Place is very famous among&s;t them, which in|deed is no wonder, becau&s;e (as they &s;ay) all tho&s;e which die there are happy.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Canje,</HI> or <HI>Cansjewaram,</HI> a great and well known City in the Kingdom of <HI>Carnatica,</HI> hath many <HI>Pagodes,</HI> and is therefore accounted very holy.</P>
<P><HI>Awentecapouri,</HI> or <HI>Awenteutica,</HI> is a City lying Northward from <HI>Agra.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Dwaraka</HI> or <HI>Dwaraweti,</HI> formerly lay near <HI>Zur|ratte,</HI> but is &s;aid to have been wa&s;h'd away by the Sea. In this Place they relate that <HI>Cri&s;tna</HI> dy'd, and that his Body when (according to the Cu&s;tom of the Countrey) it was going to be burnt, was al|&s;o wa&s;h'd away by the Sea, and driven to <HI>Sjanger|nata</HI> or <HI>Prou&s;otamai,</HI> a Place near <HI>Bengala;</HI> where|fore they account the Pagode <HI>Sjangernata</HI> to be very holy.</P>
<P>The vi&s;iting of the&s;e holy Places extends not onely to the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, but they al&s;o a&s;cribe &s;o great a power thereto, that by the na|ming of them onely they believe they &s;hall obtain pardon; wherefore Per&s;ons of Quality that are religious read over the Names of them every Morning; therefore tho&s;e that cannot go to <HI>Ca&s;i</HI> and other holy Places, content them&s;elves onely with the bare naming of them.</P>
<P>They hold that the keeping of their Fea&s;ts, and wa&s;hing their Bodies with &s;alt Water, al&s;o merits remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins; al&s;o they go in Pilgrimage to the Pagode <HI>Ramme&s;wara,</HI> by the <HI>Malabars</HI> call'd <HI>Rammanatakovil,</HI> partly for the great Sanctity of the Place, and partly becau&s;e the Sea-water that flows by this <HI>Pagode,</HI> is always clear, and fit to wa&s;h in.</P>
<P>The like opinion they have of the <HI>Ganges,</HI> and therefore the Inhabitants of <HI>Bengala</HI> which dwell about it, have a Cu&s;tom to bring all dying Per|&s;ons thither, and put one half of their Bodies into it to wa&s;h away their &s;ins. But all Per&s;ons are not permitted to wa&s;h them&s;elves therein without paying Tribute to tho&s;e Kings through who&s;e Countreys the River runs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brahmans</HI> derive the Sanctity of this River from Heaven, and confirm their Fancy with many ridiculous Fables, yet they firmly believe the &s;ame, becau&s;e their <HI>Vedam</HI> or Law-book doth con|firm it.</P>
<P>All the foremention'd ways the <HI>Heathens</HI> pra|cti&s;e to obtain remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins; and if any chance not to have endeavor'd the &s;ame, yet they believe, that their Friends or Relations which &s;ur|vive may do &s;omething for their benefit after Death; particularly, they carry and throw the Bones of the Decea&s;ed into the holy River <HI>Gan|ges,</HI> which they firmly believe will turn much to the Decea&s;ed's advantage, who for every year that their Bones lie in the &s;aid River, they &s;hall enjoy a thou&s;and years of plea&s;ure in <HI>Dewendre.</HI></P>
<P>Thirty Leagues Southward from <HI>Ca&s;i</HI> lies a City call'd <HI>Goya,</HI> where it is &s;aid, that God &s;etting his Foot on a great Stone, left the print thereof be|hind him, which is yet to be &s;een. Round about this City is a Fort for the pre&s;ervation of the foremention'd Relick.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that go in Pilgrimage to <HI>Preyaga,</HI> com|monly &s;pend a whole month there, and wa&s;h them&s;elves daily before the Sun ri&s;es in the River <HI>Ganges;</HI> after the expiration of which they go from thence to <HI>Ca&s;i,</HI> where al&s;o they &s;pend a con&s;idera|ble time, they come again to <HI>Gaga,</HI> where ma|king a Pa&s;te of fine Flour, they lay &s;everal pieces thereof on the foremention'd Stone, naming at the laying down of each piece one of their decea&s;ed Friends, who (as their <HI>Vedam</HI> or Law-book affirms)
<PB N="152" REF="116">are deliver'd out of <HI>Jamma Locon,</HI> or <HI>Hell,</HI> and con|vey'd to the place of <HI>Dewendre.</HI></P>
<P>They maintain that the Wicked &s;hall meet with more or le&s;s puni&s;hment after this Life, ac|cording to their de&s;erts, and that &s;ome after Death are puni&s;h'd in this World, and others in &s;ome other place.</P>
<P>They al&s;o believe, that the Souls of &s;ome when they die, tran&s;migrate into other Bodies. Among&s;t tho&s;e who&s;e Souls are tran&s;migrated in|to the Bodies of Bea&s;ts, they account tho&s;e which enter into a Cow the mo&s;t happy, becau&s;e of all Bea&s;ts that is mo&s;t acceptable to their God.</P>
<P>Some they believe are for their &s;ins, condemn'd to be evil Spirits, flying up and down in the Air, till the time of their puni&s;hment be expir'd.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that are not puni&s;h'd in the World, are tortur'd in <HI>Jamma,</HI> or Hell, though &s;ome are re|leas'd after the expiration of many years, and co|ming again into this World, enter into one or other Body; yet &s;ome never return from thence, but are for ever puni&s;h'd there, <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e that are put into the <HI>Antam Tappes,</HI> that is, <HI>The Pit of Dark|ne&s;s,</HI> out of which none can come, but mu&s;t remain there for ever, and undergo perpetual torments, the place being full of Thi&s;tles and Thorns, Crows with Iron Bills, devouring Dogs, &s;tinging Worms, and all things el&s;e to make them mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>Moreover they affirm, that there are five deadly Sins never to be forgiven, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. To commit Ince&s;t with their Mother, (by the word Mother they not onely under&s;tand their natural Mother, but al&s;o their Mother-in-law, and the Wife of their Ma&s;ters or Tutors.) 2. To kill a <HI>Brahman.</HI> 3. To &s;teal Gold. 4. To be a Drunkard; and 5. To conver&s;e with them.</P>
<P>As to what concerns the condition of tho&s;e that are e&s;teem'd happy after Death, they give this Account: That &s;ome of them return again to the World, after the expiration of a certain limited time; though others attain a perpetual and ever|la&s;ting happine&s;s at the fir&s;t; That &s;uch as are or|dain'd to come a &s;econd time into the World, have &s;even places appointed for them, <HI>viz. Indre-Locon</HI> or <HI>Dewendre-Lokon, Agni-Locon, Niruti-Locon, Wajoiva-Locon, Cubera-Locon, I&s;anja-Locon,</HI> and <HI>Wa&s;rouna-Locon,</HI> all of them &s;o call'd from the Per|&s;ons which Govern them. Tho&s;e which come in|to the&s;e Places, enjoy &s;o much happine&s;s in them, that they wi&s;h for no greater, and every one ac|counts his own Place the be&s;t. But be&s;ides the&s;e &s;even, which are call'd by the general Name of <HI>Dewendre-Locon</HI> or <HI>Surgam,</HI> there is another call'd <HI>Bramma-Locon,</HI> the place where <HI>Bramma</HI> re&s;ides, and is the neare&s;t Heaven: Tho&s;e which go thither after Death, mu&s;t after the expiration of &s;ome years return again into the World, where having &s;tay'd their appointed time, they certainly go to Heaven, for ever to enjoy all manner of Delights and Plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that inhabit the <HI>Surgam</HI> they name <HI>De|weta's,</HI> which are of two &s;orts; &s;ome &s;taying there onely for a time, return again into the World, af|ter which they enjoy all manner of Plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Other <HI>Deweta's</HI> &s;tay for ever in the <HI>Surgam,</HI> as al&s;o the Sun, Moon, Stars, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They al&s;o beget Children in the <HI>Surgam,</HI> where they affirm no &s;ins are committed, becau&s;e God him&s;elf appearing therein, in&s;tructs them. Moreover, the happie&s;t that depart from hence, are tho&s;e which attain to the <HI>Weicontam,</HI> which is Heaven it &s;elf: But the <HI>Brahmans</HI> make mention of two <HI>Weicontams,</HI> a <HI>Lila-Weicontam,</HI> that is, <HI>The Delightful Heaven,</HI> and a <HI>Singel-Weicontam,</HI> where God him&s;elf hath his Re|&s;idence.</P>

<P>MAny years &s;ince the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion was brought by the <HI>Arabians, Per&s;ians,</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> into <HI>India,</HI> where it hath got|ten no &s;mall footing, having gain'd many Pro&s;e|lytes, in&s;omuch that mo&s;t of the Nobility; nay, the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> him&s;elf is a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> as al&s;o the Kings of <HI>India, Cambaya,</HI> and <HI>Bengala;</HI> which &s;prang from hence: The <HI>Moors</HI> which were brought as Slaves into <HI>India</HI> after &s;ome time making them|&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Countrey, forc'd the Idola|ters to embrace their Religion.

<P>The Tract of Land from <HI>Surat</HI> to <HI>Brampore</HI> is exceeding plea&s;ant, and full of Rivulets and Springs; but the way from <HI>Brampore</HI> to <HI>Agra</HI> is Mountainous, and trouble&s;om for the Camels to Travel; yet it is free from Robbers.

<P><HI>Schach Jehan</HI> a little before the&s;e Troubles &s;ee|ing him&s;elf charg'd with the&s;e four Princes, all grown up and Marry'd, and ob&s;erving that each of them pretended to the Crown, and carrying them|&s;elves as Enemies one to another, &s;ought privately to compa&s;s their De&s;igns, was exceedingly per|plex'd, not knowing what to do, and began to fear his own Per&s;on, as if he fore&s;aw what afterwards befell him; to lock them up in <HI>Govaleor</HI> (which is a Fort where Princes are generally &s;ecur'd, and in|vincible by rea&s;on of its &s;ituation on an inacce&s;&s;i|ble Rock, and the abundance of fre&s;h Water, and Provi&s;ions for the Souldiers in Garri&s;on) was no &s;mall Bu&s;ine&s;s, they being already very powerful, and liv'd in the State and Splendor of Princes: Moreover, he could not in honor &s;end them away to any Place, without giving them Dominions ac|cording to their Birth, and therefore timorous that they might rebell, and make them&s;elves ab&s;olute Princes in their re&s;pective Juri&s;dictions, as indeed afterwards they did; yet neverthele&s;s, out of fear lea&s;t they &s;hould de&s;troy one another in his Pre|&s;ence, which might chance to happen, if he kept them at his Court, he re&s;olv'd to &s;end them away;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sons &s;ent to Govern &s;e|veral Provin|ces, onely the elde&s;t &s;tays at the Court.</NOTE> and accordingly &s;eat <HI>Sultan Cha&s;ou&s;a</HI> to the King|dom of <HI>Bengala; Oranchzef,</HI> to <HI>Decan; Moradbeck,</HI> to <HI>Zurratte;</HI> and gave the Government of <HI>Cabul</HI> and <HI>Multan</HI> to <HI>Darasja:</HI> The three fir&s;t left the Court well &s;atisfi'd with their new acquir'd Do|minions, where they made them&s;elves &s;upream Governors, and kept the Revenues of the Coun|treys for the maintenance of &s;trong Armies, un|der pretence to keep their Subjects and Neigh|bors in quiet. But <HI>Darasja</HI> being the elde&s;t, and Heir to the Crown, dwelt not from the Court, which was the De&s;ign of <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> who al|ways fed him up with a Promi&s;e that he &s;hould &s;ucceed him; and al&s;o granted him to give Com|mi&s;&s;ions, and had a &s;mall Throne underneath his among&s;t the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> &s;o that there &s;eemingly were two Kings; but as two equal Powers can &s;carce agree, &s;o <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> notwith&s;tanding <HI>Darasja</HI> was very re&s;pective to him, and &s;hew'd him great Reverence, was &s;till in fear of being poy&s;on'd by him, and the more, becau&s;e <HI>Darasja</HI> was jealous of <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> whom for his excellent Parts his Fa|ther judg'd fitter to &s;ucceed him than any of his other Sons.</P>

Whereupon all Per&s;ons were immediately put into Arms, &s;o that an Army was form'd, as it was reported, of a hun|dred thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and twenty thou&s;and Foot, and a va&s;t Train of Artillery: Yet notwith&s;tand|ing this was the mo&s;t compleat and bigge&s;t Army that ever was &s;een in <HI>Hindo&s;tan,</HI> and &s;ufficient to defeat three or four &s;uch as that of <HI>Oranchzef</HI> (who had not above thirty five or forty thou&s;and Men in all, and tho&s;e tir'd and &s;pent by their long and trouble&s;om March, by rea&s;on of the exce&s;&s;ive Heats) a thing almo&s;t incredible, there was &s;carce one Per&s;on, but ominou&s;ly pre&s;ag'd <HI>Darasja</HI>'s ru|ine, e&s;pecially becau&s;e none of the <HI>Omrahs</HI> had any re&s;pect or kindne&s;s for him, and all the prime Sol|diers on whom his dependance lay, were in <HI>Soliman Chekou</HI>'s Army. To venture a Battel, all his Friends, as well as <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> di&s;&s;waded him from. His Father al&s;o proffer'd him&s;elf in the heighth of his Sickne&s;s, to be carry'd into the Field before <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> which undoubtedly would have been a great introducement to Peace, and al|&s;o very beneficial to <HI>Schach Jehan:</HI> for certainly <HI>Oranchzef</HI> and <HI>Moradbeck</HI> would never have dar'd to fight again&s;t their own Father; and though they had bin powerful enough to have attempted, they would certainly have &s;uffer'd for it, not onely becau&s;e their Forces were not equal, and all the great <HI>Omrahs</HI> were &s;o fix'd for <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> that they would not have fail'd, &s;eeing him in the Head of the Army, to have fought very re&s;olutely, but al&s;o becau&s;e that <HI>Oranchzef</HI> and <HI>Moradbeck</HI>'s Com|manders had &s;o great an affection for this Prince, who&s;e Creatures mo&s;t of them were, that they would have turn'd their Swords again&s;t them their Generals, and per&s;waded the whole Army to De|clare them&s;elves for their old Prince. Then they per&s;waded <HI>Darasja,</HI> &s;ince he would not hearken to any Advice, not to march with his Army into the Field, but to &s;tay till <HI>Soliman Chekou</HI> came to joyn with him, which would be very &s;uddenly, he be|ing already on his March to <HI>Agra;</HI> which al&s;o was good Coun&s;el, becau&s;e he was a Per&s;on belov'd by all, having return'd victoriou&s;ly, and the mo&s;t loyal and brave Soldiers being &s;till in his Army. But <HI>Darasja</HI> would not regard any Propo&s;itions that were offer'd to him, how rea&s;onable and ad|vantageous &s;oever, thinking on nothing but giving &s;peedy Battel to <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> whom he re&s;olv'd to Encounter in Per&s;on; and certainly he did not ami&s;s herein, in re&s;pect to his own Honor and par|ticular Intere&s;t, if Fortune had befriended him; but things fell not out as he had contriv'd them, and very probably for the&s;e rea&s;ons:</P>
<P>He look'd upon him&s;elf as Ma&s;ter of <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> whom he knew he could &s;way as he pleas'd: He was at that time Owner of all his Trea&s;ures and &s;trong Holds: <HI>Cha&s;au&s;a</HI> was half defeated, and his two other Brothers came with a faint and tir'd Army to throw them&s;elves into his Hands, which they could not mi&s;s if he won the Battel: That then he &s;hould at once be ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter, at the end of all his Troubles, and attain to the heighth of his Wi&s;hes without any ones contra|diction; when as on the contrary, if his Father &s;hould go into the Field, all Affairs would be ac|commodated, and his Brothers return to their Do|minions: Moreover, that if he &s;hould &s;tay for <HI>So|liman Chekou</HI> his Son, <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> might plot &s;ome De&s;ign to his Di&s;advantage, or contrive &s;ome|thing with <HI>Oranchzef;</HI> and that whatever he &s;hould do to gain the Victory, the Reputation his Son had already gotten, would give him all the Honor thereof: What would not he be capable to undertake, &s;woln with &s;o much Glory and Suc|ce&s;s, and e&s;pecially being &s;upported as he was by the Favor and Affection of <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> and the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Omrahs?</HI> What did he know whether he would keep any Re&s;pect or Duty for his Father, and what his Ambition might prompt him to?</P>
<P>The&s;e Con&s;iderations made <HI>Darasja</HI> conclude to refu&s;e all Per&s;ons Advice, and act according to his own Humor, and thereupon immediately com|manded his whole Army to march into the Field, and went him&s;elf to take his leave of his Father, then in the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Agra,</HI> who &s;hed a multitude of Tears, embracing him, and thus be&s;peaking him; <HI>Well,</HI> Darasja, <HI>you are re&s;olv'd to follow your own Will, go, and God ble&s;s you; but remember the&s;e few words; if you lo&s;e the Battel, take heed of ever coming into my Pre&s;ence.</HI> But all this making no great impre&s;&s;ion on him, he went away boldly, and taking Hor&s;e, rode with his Army to block up the Pa&s;&s;age through the River <HI>Schembel,</HI> about twelve Leagues from <HI>Agra;</HI> where Intrenching him&s;elf, he re&s;olutely expected his Enemy. But <HI>Oranch|zef</HI> (who being more &s;ubtil and crafty, wanted not good Spyes, that inform'd him of all Tran&s;actions) knowing it there to be very difficult, never attemp|ted to force it, but coming to Encamp him&s;elf on the other &s;ide, oppo&s;ite to <HI>Darasja</HI>'s Army, was &s;een by them, whil&s;t he &s;ent to a rebellious <HI>Raja,</HI> nam'd <HI>Chempet,</HI> &s;everal rich Pre&s;ents, and made him many Promi&s;es, if he would permit him to march through his Countrey, that &s;o he might find a place where the River was more fordable. <HI>Chempet</HI> not onely con&s;ented, but proffer'd to be his Guide, to lead him cro&s;s his Countrey through the Woods and Mountains. Whereupon <HI>Oranchzef</HI> rai|&s;ing his Camp privately in the Night, left onely &s;ome Tents &s;tanding, thereby to amu&s;e <HI>Darasja,</HI> and marching night and day, got over the River before he had any notice thereof; but as &s;oon as ever he receiv'd the news, he left his Station, and ha&s;ted to Engage his Enemy, who was &s;aid to march with great &s;peed towards <HI>Agra,</HI> to gain the River <HI>Gemna,</HI> and there without trouble, and at his plea&s;ure to u&s;e the Water, and fortifying him|&s;elf, expect <HI>Darasja</HI>'s coming.

But <HI>Darasja</HI> return'd him in an&s;wer, That before three days pa&s;s'd, he would bring <HI>Oranchzef</HI> and <HI>Moradbeck</HI> bound Hand and

<P><HI>Je&s;&s;eingue</HI> found him&s;elf &s;ufficiently perplex'd in what he had to do, exceedingly fearing <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> and more to lay Hands on a Royal Per&s;on, well knowing, that at one time or other &s;ome mi&s;chief might befal him even from <HI>Oranchzef</HI> him&s;elf. Be&s;ides, he knew that <HI>Soliman Chekouh</HI> had too much Courage to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be ta|ken after that manner, and that he would rather die in defending him&s;elf. Wherefore having con|&s;ulted with <HI>Delilcan</HI> his great Friend, and after they had renew'd their Oaths of Mutual Fidelity, he went directly to the Tent of <HI>Soliman Chekouh,</HI> who with great impatience expected him, (he ha|ving al&s;o heard the News of his Father's being defeated) and had already &s;ent for him &s;everal times: He then made the Prince a free di&s;covery of all things, &s;hew'd him the Letter of <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> told him what cour&s;e was be&s;t for him to take, repre&s;ented to him the danger he was in, adding, That there was no rea&s;on he &s;hould repo&s;e any confidence in <HI>Delilcan,</HI> or in <HI>Daoudcan,</HI> or any of the re&s;t of his Army; but that as &s;oon as was po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould flie to the Mountains of <HI>Serena|guer,</HI> which would be the be&s;t Expedient he could take: for the <HI>Raja</HI> of that Countrey being in un|acce&s;&s;ible Places, and not knowing <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> would undoubtedly receive him with much free|dom; and from thence he might from time to time &s;ee how things would go, and always be rea|dy to return again when he pleas'd. But the young Prince immediately apprehended by this Di&s;cour&s;e, that henceforth there was no great confidence to be put in <HI>Je&s;&s;eingue,</HI> and that there was no &s;afety there for his Per&s;on, becau&s;e he knew <HI>Delilcan</HI> to be of his Party; &s;o that he &s;aw there was a nece&s;&s;ity of making u&s;e of <HI>Je&s;&s;eingue</HI>'s Coun&s;el: Whereupon commanding his Baggage to be pack'd up, he immediately march'd towards the Mountains.

Mean|while he continu'd his &s;ecret Coun&s;els and Cabals, and &s;ounded the minds of all the greate&s;t <HI>Omrahs</HI> &s;o far, that at la&s;t, after he had well and clo&s;ely laid his De&s;ign, and politickly di&s;pos'd all things for the &s;ucce&s;s thereof, he &s;ent his elde&s;t Son <HI>Sul|tan Mahmoud</HI> into the Ca&s;tle, under a pretence of &s;peaking with his Father; who was no &s;ooner en|tred, but he fell boldly upon the fir&s;t Sentinel, and drove away all that oppos'd him, whil&s;t a great number of Men appointed for that purpo&s;e, force|ing their pa&s;&s;age after him, immediately made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the Walls, which exceed|ingly a&s;toni&s;h'd <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> he &s;eeing him&s;elf taken in the &s;ame Snare which he had prepar'd for another, impri&s;on'd in his own Palace, and <HI>Oranchzef</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Fort: 'Tis &s;aid that he pre&s;ently &s;ent to try the temper of <HI>Sultan Mah|moud,</HI> and promis'd him by his Crown and the <HI>Alcoran,</HI> That if he would be faithful to him, and &s;erve him in this Conjuncture, he would make him King; and that in order thereunto, he &s;hould immediately come to him, and not &s;lip this op|portunity: Be&s;ides that it would be an action that would accumulate on him the Ble&s;&s;ings of Hea|ven, and an immortal Glory, in regard it would be &s;aid for ever, That <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> had deli|ver'd <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> his Grandfather out of Pri&s;on.

And thus it appears that <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> committed a great error, that he did not come out of the Ca&s;tle after the Battel and <HI>Darasja</HI>'s Flight; though, as others affirm, he did very prudently therein. The &s;ame Rea&s;oners maintain, That the greate&s;t fault which <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly commit, was, that he knew not how to make u&s;e of this occa&s;ion to &s;e|cure him&s;elf of the Crown, by the mo&s;t generous Action that ever he could be capable of, to &s;et hi Grandfather at liberty, and thus to do him&s;elf Right and Ju&s;tice, as the Sovereign Umpire of Affairs; whereas, as things then &s;tood, he mu&s;t one day go and die in <HI>Govaleor:</HI> But <HI>Sultan Mah|moud</HI> (whether he fear'd that <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> would not keep his Word, or dur&s;t not di&s;plea&s;e his Father) would not hearken to any Offers, nor en|ter into the King's Appartment, alledging, That he had no Order from his Father to &s;ee him; but that he was by him commanded not to return from thence without bringing him the Keys of all the Gates of the Fortre&s;s, that &s;o he might come with all &s;afety and ki&s;s his Maje&s;ties Feet. Two days were pa&s;t before it could be re&s;olv'd whether the Keys &s;hould be deliver'd to him; during which, <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> watch'd night and day with all his Troops about him; till at length <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> &s;eeing all the Guards which watch'd at the little Gate to disband one after another, and perceiving no more &s;afety on his part, deliver'd the &s;ame to him, with Order to tell <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> that he &s;hould come and &s;ee him that day, if he were wi&s;e; for he had Bu&s;ine&s;s of grand concern to im|part to him: But <HI>Oranchzef</HI> being too &s;ubtile to commit &s;o great an error, in&s;tantly made his Eu|nuch <HI>Etharcan</HI> Governor of the Fort, who pre&s;ent|ly lock'd up <HI>Schach Jehan,</HI> with his Daughter <HI>Be|gum Saheb,</HI> and all his Women, cau&s;ing many Gates to be &s;topp'd up, that &s;o he might neither &s;peak nor write to any body, nor go out of his Appartment without leave.

Thus <HI>Sultan Cha&s;au&s;a</HI> had time to re|tire, and to chu&s;e a convenient Place of Defence, the better to recruit both his Forces and Train of Artillery from <HI>Lower Bengale,</HI> becau&s;e he had been very friendly to the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> which for the fer|tility of the Countrey were come to &s;ettle there, and had always been very re&s;pective to the Ca|tholick Prie&s;ts which are in this Province for the promulgating of their Religion, making them great Promi&s;es to enrich them all, and give them free leave to build Temples where&s;oever they pleas'd. And indeed they were capable enough to &s;erve him, there being in <HI>Bengale</HI> at lea&s;t eight or nine thou&s;and Families of <HI>Franks,</HI> either Na|tive <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> or <HI>Me&s;tizes,</HI> being &s;uch as are got|ten by the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> on <HI>Indian</HI> Women.</P>
<P><HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> who for the foremention'd Rea&s;ons was grown very in&s;olent, and perhaps at that time a&s;pir'd to greater things than he ought, pretended to command the Army ab&s;olutely, and that <HI>Emir Jemla</HI> &s;hould follow his Orders, letting al&s;o from time to time many in&s;olent Words fall in reference to his Father <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> as if he were oblig'd to him for the Crown, and utter'd con|temptible and threatning Expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t <HI>Emir Jemla,</HI> which caus'd a great coolne&s;s between them; but at la&s;t, <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> being inform'd that his Father was much di&s;&s;atisfied with his ill Conduct, and fearing that <HI>Emir</HI> might have Or|der to &s;ecure his Per&s;on, he went, accompanied with a &s;mall number of Men, to <HI>Sultan Cha&s;au&s;a,</HI> to whom &s;wearing Fidelity, he made great Promi|&s;es: But <HI>Cha&s;au&s;a,</HI> who look'd upon it as a Plot of <HI>Oranchzef</HI> and <HI>Emir,</HI> dur&s;t not confide in him, but kept a continual Eye over him, and gave him no con&s;iderable Command; which &s;o di&s;&s;atisfied him, that &s;ome Months after he concluded to leave <HI>Sultan Cha&s;au&s;a,</HI> and went again to <HI>Emir Jemla,</HI> who favorably receiving him, promis'd to write in his behalf to <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> whom he would endeavor to per&s;wade to forget and pardon his Errors.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Sultan Mah|moud <HI>&s;ent to</HI> Govaleor.</NOTE>Some are of opinion, that this E&s;cape of <HI>Sultan Mahmoud</HI> was altogether by the contrivance of <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> who car'd not much to hazard this Son to de&s;troy <HI>Cha&s;au&s;a,</HI> and was &s;en&s;ible that this would be a very ju&s;t pretence to &s;ecure his Per&s;on.

<P>Thus <HI>Oranchzef</HI> freeing him&s;elf from great perplexity, told his &s;econd Son, that the Point of Reigning was &s;o tickli&s;h a thing, that Kings mu&s;t be jealous of their own Shadow: Therefore if he were not di&s;creet and careful, the &s;ame thing might happen to him as had befallen his Brother; but that whil&s;t he kept him&s;elf within the bounds of his Duty and Obedience, he &s;hould find him a loving and indulgent Father: Prote&s;ting likewi&s;e, That he intended not to offer the lea&s;t violence to the Per&s;on of <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> his Father. But <HI>Oranchzef</HI> had at this time no occa&s;ion to &s;u&s;pect his Son <HI>Sultan Mazum,</HI> or to be di&s;&s;atisfied with him; for never was any Slave more humble: nor did ever <HI>Oranchzef</HI> him&s;elf appear more carele&s;s of Greatne&s;s, nor more given to Devotion, than <HI>Sultan Mazum:</HI> Yet &s;ome knowing Per&s;ons be|liev'd, that he was not &s;o in reality, but by &s;uper|lative Policy and Craft, like his Father, of which we may have a Proof in time.</P>

Mo&s;t People were exceedingly amaz'd at the boldne&s;s of ma|king him pa&s;s through the Town, and the more, becau&s;e he was but ill guarded, and exceedingly belov'd by the Vulgar, who at that time exclaim'd highly again&s;t the cruelty and tyranny of <HI>Oranch|zef,</HI> as one that kept his Father in Pri&s;on, and al&s;o his own Son <HI>Sultan Mahmoud,</HI> and his Brother <HI>Mo|radbeck;</HI> but not one Man had the boldne&s;s to draw his Sword, onely there were &s;ome of the <HI>Fakiers,</HI> and &s;ome poor People, who &s;eeing that infamous <HI>Gioncan</HI> ride by his &s;ide, began to rail and throw &s;tones at him, and to call him Traitor; and indeed all the tops of the Hou&s;es and Shops being throng'd with Spectators, there was nothing heard but loud Outcries and Lamentations, with Invectives and Cur&s;es heap'd upon <HI>Gioncan;</HI> in a word, both Men and Women, great and &s;mall, &s;o compa&s;&s;ionate are the <HI>Indians,</HI> were ready to melt into Tears, yet none dur&s;t attempt to re&s;cue him.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Con&s;ultati|on held, whe|ther to put him to death, or &s;end him to <HI>Govaleor.</HI></NOTE>Several Per&s;ons of Quality that were there pre|&s;ent, were not wanting to tell <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> that mo&s;t of the People &s;eeing <HI>Darasja</HI> pa&s;s by, lamented for him very much, and cur&s;ing the <HI>Patan</HI> that had de|liver'd him, were ready to &s;tone him to death, and con&s;equently there was great fear of an In|&s;urrection or Di&s;turbance.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An odd Her|mite.</NOTE><HI>Anno</HI> 1664. <HI>F.

<P>In or between the Mountains which belong to <HI>Cachemire,</HI> are many fertile Plains, and among&s;t others, one which pays Hides and Wooll for Tri|bute, which the Governor &s;ends for yearly.</P>
<P>The Women here are very hand&s;om, cha&s;te,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Women hand&s;om.</NOTE> and Laborious.</P>
<P>The Merchants of <HI>Cachemire</HI> go yearly from Mountain to Mountain to buy up the Wooll, of which they make a certain Stuff call'd <HI>Chales.</HI></P>
<P>There is yet another Place very remote from <HI>Cachemire,</HI> which al&s;o pays Tribute in Hides and Wooll, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es very many plea&s;ant and fruitful &s;mall Plains and Valleys, which produce Wheat, Rice, Apples, Pears, Apricocks, Melons, and Grapes, of which the Owners make excellent Wine.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants have often refus'd to pay Tri|bute, on the account of the trouble&s;om, and almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible Ways that lead into their Countrey; but there have ever been means found to get into their Juri&s;diction, to reduce them to Obedience.</P>
<P>Moreover, in the Mountains which lie farther off, and not under the Juri&s;diction of <HI>Cachemire,</HI> are very plea&s;ant Tracts of Lands, inhabited by a white and well &s;hap'd People, who &s;eldom come from thence.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome that are under no King, nor have they any Religion, onely &s;ome account it a &s;in to eat Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Out of all the&s;e Mountains ri&s;e many Springs and Rivulets, which the Inhabitants convey to their Rice-Fields along great Ditches, which ha|ving fill'd many le&s;&s;er, at la&s;t make a great naviga|ble River for Ships of a con&s;iderable Burthen. This Stream having pa&s;s'd round about the King|dom, and through the middle of the chief City <HI>Caximir,</HI> &s;eeks a pa&s;&s;age out at <HI>Boramoule,</HI> between two &s;piry Rocks, from whence falling with great force, it receives by the way the Waters of many little Brooks, which al&s;o &s;pring out of the Moun|tains, and at la&s;t di&s;charges its Waters near <HI>Attack</HI> in the River <HI>Indus.</HI></P>
<P>All the&s;e Rivulets gliding from the Mountains, make the low Lands exceeding fertile, in&s;omuch that the whole Kingdome is like a Garden, which being all over green, hath here and there &s;ome Villages &s;ituate among&s;t the Trees, and is divided into &s;everal Beds, Sow'n with Rice, Wheat, and other Grain, be&s;ides Saffron and Hemp, inter|woven with Water-cour&s;es, Channels, and &s;ome little Lakes and Rivulets, and every where planted with <HI>European</HI> Trees and Flowers, as Apples, Pears, Plumbs, Apricocks, Nuts, and Vines.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The De&s;cri|ption of the City and Lake of <HI>Ca|chemire.</HI></NOTE>The chief Town of this Countrey bears the &s;ame Denomination with the Kingdom, and being without Walls, is three quarters of a Mile long, and half a Mile broad. It is &s;ituate in a barren Field, about two Leagues from the Mountains, which &s;eem to make a Semi-circle about a Lake of &s;weet Water, of about four or five Leagues in circumference. This Lake is made by running Springs and Brooks which glide from the Moun|tains, and di&s;charges its Water through a naviga|ble Channel, into a River which runs through the middle of the City, and hath two Bridges over it.</P>
<P>This Lake is al&s;o full of I&s;lands, which re&s;em|ble &s;o many plea&s;ant Gardens, with delightful Walks and Arbors, and are &s;urrounded with Pop|lar and other Trees, which have Leaves about two Foot broad, and are as tall as the Ma&s;ts of Ships, with Boughs onely on the top like Date-trees.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of the Lake, upon the hang|ing of the Mountains, are al&s;o abundance of Ban|quetting-hou&s;es and Gardens, for which that place is mo&s;t convenient, becau&s;e it hath a delicate Air, a Pro&s;pect on the Lake, I&s;lands, and a City, and is full of Springs and Rivulets. The be&s;t of all the Gardens being the Kings, is in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Lan|guage call'd <HI>Schach-Limar,</HI> that is, <HI>The King's Gar|den.</HI> Out of the Lake they go into this Garden through a Channel between two rows of Trees planted along its Banks about five hundred Paces long.</P>
<P>This Channel leads to the King's Sugar-hou&s;e, which is al&s;o in the mid&s;t of the Garden, where begins another brave Moat reaching to the upper end of the Garden.</P>
<P>The bottom of the foremention'd Channel is pav'd with Free&s;tone, and the &s;ides thereof rais'd al&s;o with the &s;ame Stone; in the middle thereof are many Springs of Water, which being in a row fifteen Paces di&s;tant one from another, &s;hoot up above the other Water. Moreover, there are Receptacles of Water like Ponds, out of which by means of &s;everal Springs the Water ri&s;es up in many &s;mall Streams, which make divers Figures. This Channel ends at another great Banquetting-hou&s;e, not much unlike the former.</P>
<P>The foremention'd Plea&s;ure-hou&s;es, built al|mo&s;t like Cloy&s;ters, lying in the middle of the Moat, are &s;urrounded with Water; between the two rows of Poplar Trees they have Galleries or Balconies built round about them, and four Doors oppo&s;ite one to another; two whereof fronting the two rows of Trees, have two Bridges which lead cro&s;s the Water, one on each &s;ide; the other two front the two ends of the Channel. Each Summer-hou&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in a great Room in the mid&s;t of four le&s;&s;er, which make the Square; the Walls of both the great and &s;mall Rooms are richly Gilded and Painted, and full of In&s;cripti|ons in large <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Characters; the four Doors are very &s;tately, of large Stones, with two Co|lumns fetch'd out of the ancient <HI>Pagan</HI> Temples which <HI>Schach Jehan</HI> caus'd to be ruin'd. The value of the&s;e Stones is not known, nor of what &s;pecies they are, unle&s;s Marble or Porphyrie.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the Hou&s;es are built of Wood two Sto|reys high, not for want of Stone, there being many old ruin'd <HI>Deuras</HI> or Temples, but for the cheap|ne&s;s, by rea&s;on of the abundance of Wood which grows on the adjacent Mountains, from whence it may be fetch'd for a &s;mall matter, and carried to the City along a little River.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;es built along the River &s;ide have each of them a Garden, which hath a Pro&s;pect on the Water. The other Hou&s;es that do not &s;tand near the River have Gardens al&s;o, and many of them a little Channel, which runs into the Lake, into which they can Row from their Hou&s;es in &s;mall Boats</P>
<P>At one end of the City appears a very &s;teep Mountain, at the foot whereof are many fair Hou|&s;es with Gardens, and on the top a <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> with an Orchard and Garden belonging to it; In re|gard whereof the Inhabitants in their Language call this Mountain <HI>Hary Porbet,</HI> that is, <HI>Green Mountain.</HI></P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to this appears another Mountain, being al&s;o crown'd with a <HI>Mo&s;que,</HI> and likewi&s;e an ancient Structure, which &s;eems to have been a <HI>Deu|ra</HI> or <HI>Pagode;</HI> but it is call'd <HI>Tackt Souliman,</HI> that is, <HI>The Throne of Salomon,</HI> becau&s;e (as the <HI>Mahume|tans</HI> &s;ay) <HI>Salomon</HI> built it when he came to <HI>Cache|mire.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A wonderful Spring.</NOTE>At the Confines of this Kingdom, two or three days Journey from the City <HI>Cachemire,</HI> a Spring near the foot of a Mountain works Wonders (as the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> affirm) in <HI>May,</HI> when the Snow melts on the Mountains, <HI>viz.</HI> it ebbs and flows for fifteen days together three times in a day, in the Morning, at Noon, and at Night; after the fir&s;t fifteen days its Cour&s;e is not &s;o exact, and after a Months time it &s;tops altogether the remaining part of the year, except in the time of great and long Rains, when it overflows like other Springs.</P>
<P>The <HI>Heathens</HI> have on the Brink of this Spring, a little <HI>Deura</HI> or <HI>Pagode,</HI> built in honor of one of their Idols, wherefore they have call'd it <HI>Send Brary,</HI> as if they would &s;ay <HI>Water of Brary,</HI> whither many People go in Pilgrimage to Bathe them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Many &s;trange Relations they give concerning the original of this Spring; the Mountain at who&s;e foot it &s;prings, extends in length from North to South, and appears at a di&s;tance like a Plain, &s;ome|what ri&s;ing in the middle, and is about a hundred Paces broad on the top; the North &s;ide hath &s;ome Verdure, but quickly decaying for want of the Suns influence; the other &s;ide on the We&s;t is &s;haded with Trees and Brambles.</P>
<P>Some di&s;tance from the High-way is a plea&s;ant Seat of the ancient Kings of <HI>Cachemire,</HI> and at pre|&s;ent of the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> call'd <HI>Achiavela.</HI> The mo&s;t remarkable thing belonging thereunto is a Spring, who&s;e Water runs round about the Structure, and through all the Gardens in many little Channels. This Spring boyls with &s;uch great force out of the Earth, that it may rather be call'd a River than a Spring: The Water thereof is &s;o exceeding cold, that one cannot hold ones Hand in it. The Gar|den is very large and plea&s;ant, having many brave
<PB N="202" REF="149">Walks, and abundance of Fruit-trees, as Apples, Pears, Plumbs, Apricocks, and Cherries, and al&s;o many Fountains and Fi&s;h-ponds.</P>
<P>Not far from <HI>Achiavel</HI> is another brave Royal Garden, in which are all the foremention'd things for recreation; but it excells in having a Pond full of Fi&s;h, which upon calling, or throwing of Bread into the &s;ame, appear above Water; the bigge&s;t of them have been &s;een with golden Rings in their No&s;es, with Mottoes engraven on them, which are &s;aid to have been put on by order of the famous <HI>Nourmehalle,</HI> Queen to the <HI>Great Mogol Schach Selim.</HI></P>

<P>Near this <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> is a Kitchin, in which are ma|ny great Copper Kettles full of Fle&s;h and Rice, which perhaps is the Load-&s;tone that draws the Poor thither, and the Miracle which cures them.</P>

<P><HI>Eleven</HI> Mollas (&s;aith <HI>F.

<P>A con&s;iderable di&s;tance from <HI>Baramoulay</HI> is a great Lake, through the mid&s;t of which runs a Ri|ver to <HI>Baramoulay:</HI> It is full of Fi&s;h, e&s;pecially Eels, and &s;warms with Gee&s;e, wild Ducks, and other Water-fowl, which draws the Governor of <HI>Cachemire</HI> thither to &s;pend the Winter.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this Lake is a Cell, with a little Garden about it, which is &s;aid to drive after a &s;trange manner upon the Water.</P>
<P>In this Place a Reclu&s;e &s;pends his Life without ever coming from thence.</P>
<P>They relate divers Stories concerning this Her|mitage, but by mo&s;t it is generally believ'd, that an ancient King of <HI>Cachemire,</HI> out of curio&s;ity built the &s;ame on great pieces of conjoyn'd Timber.</P>
<P>About this Lake is al&s;o a remarkable Spring, which boyling lei&s;urely, ri&s;es very &s;lowly with little Bubbles, and al&s;o ca&s;ts up a certain fine Sand, which returns back to the bottom after the &s;ame manner as it came up: In a moment after the Water becomes &s;till, without boyling or ca&s;ting up the Sand, and then begins a fre&s;h as before, yet without ob&s;erving exact times between. It is &s;aid that this Wonder proceeds from a Man's &s;peaking or &s;tanding near the &s;ame, e&s;pecially if he &s;tamp with his Foot again&s;t the Ground.</P>
<P>In the Mountains is a great Lake, which is full of Ice in Summer, and re&s;embles a little Icy Sea; for the Winds breaking the Ice a&s;under, moves the &s;ame up and down.</P>

<P><HI>Maginus</HI> places this Kingdom between tho&s;e of <HI>Decan, Nar&s;inga, Orixa,</HI> and <HI>Cambaya,</HI> and extend|ing about the Province of <HI>Nar&s;inga,</HI> is &s;eparated from the Kingdom of <HI>Cambaya</HI> by great Moun|tains. The River <HI>Jeming</HI> running along one &s;ide thereof, &s;erves for a Moat, over which a Bridge with ten Arches leads into the City.</P>
<P>The ancient Metropolis being al&s;o call'd <HI>Dely,</HI> was once a fair and large City, and the Seat and Burying-place of the <HI>Mogol</HI> Emperors, who after|wards remov'd from thence to the new-built <HI>Dely.</HI> Its Glory con&s;i&s;ted in many Tombs, in which above twenty great Kings and Lords lie buried.

<PB N="204" REF="150">Field on the Banks of the River <HI>Jemna,</HI> and built onely along one &s;ide of the Stream, there being but one Bridge over the &s;ame, which is laid cro&s;s &s;e|veral Hulks: It is quite unwall'd on that &s;ide which re&s;pects the Water: The Walls are of Stone, yet not very tenible or defen&s;ive, there be|ing no Moats nor any Brea&s;tworks, but round Tow|ers after the old fa&s;hion, about a hundred Paces di|&s;tant from one another, and behind them a Mud Wall about four or five Foot thick: The circum|ference of the Wall, with the Ca&s;tle which is in|clos'd in the &s;ame, is about two Leagues and a half; but if you include a long Suburb which runs to <HI>Lahor,</HI> and being a Rellick of the old <HI>Dely,</HI> is inhabited, it will make above a League in a di|rect Line, and a Circumference which cannot ju&s;tly be limited, becau&s;e between this Suburb and the City are &s;pacious Gardens and Fields, without any Buildings. The Ca&s;tle, within which is the <HI>Ma|halle</HI> or <HI>Seraglio,</HI> be&s;ides other Royal Apartments, is built round, orather in a Semi-circle, and looks upon the River; between which and the Walls is a large &s;andy Plain, where they generally let the Elephants fight, and often Mu&s;ter the <HI>Rajas</HI> or, principal <HI>Omrahs</HI> Soldiers in the King's Pre&s;ence, who beholds the &s;ame out of his Hall Windows. The Walls of the Ca&s;tle in re&s;pect of the round Towers, built after the old fa&s;hion, are almo&s;t like tho&s;e of the City, but rais'd with Bricks and red Stones, which appearing like Marble, makes them much more beautiful than tho&s;e of the City, than which they are al&s;o much higher, &s;tronger, thicker, and more &s;ub&s;tantial again&s;t &s;mall Field-pieces. Be&s;ides, it is &s;urrounded, except on the Water &s;ide, with a Moat of good Water, abounding with Fi&s;h, rais'd on both &s;ides with Free-&s;tone; yet neverthele&s;s a Battery planted with great Guns may ea&s;ily beat it down. Round about the Moat lies a large Garden, which in all Sea&s;ons is full of green Trees and Flowers, which with the red Walls make a plea&s;ant Pro&s;pect. Round about this Garden runs the great Street, or rather a great Royal Court or Plain, on which open two of the greate&s;t and chiefe&s;t Gates of the Ca&s;tle, leading into the mo&s;t eminent Streets of the City.</P>
<P>On the foremention'd Plain al&s;o &s;tand the Tents of the <HI>Rajas,</HI> who being in the King's Service, watch every week by turns, whil&s;t the <HI>Omrahs</HI> do the &s;ame Duty in the Ca&s;tle, the <HI>Rajas</HI> delighting more to be in the Field, than lock'd up in the Fortre&s;s.</P>
<P>On the &s;aid Plain they al&s;o breathe the King's Hor&s;es every Morning; it &s;erves al&s;o for a <HI>Bazar</HI> or Market-place, where all &s;orts of Merchandi&s;e are &s;old, and is the Meeting-place of &s;everal Phi|lo&s;ophers and A&s;tronomers, as well <HI>Mahumetans</HI> as <HI>Indians.</HI></P>
<P>Here al&s;o the great <HI>Cobatcan,</HI> or Commi&s;&s;ary of the Hor&s;e, takes a &s;pecial Account of all the Troopers Hor&s;es that enter into the King's Ser|vice, <HI>viz.</HI> if he finds the Hor&s;es to be <HI>Turki&s;h,</HI> that is from <HI>Turke&s;tan,</HI> or from <HI>Tartary,</HI> and big and able to do Service, then he marks them with a hot Iron on the Buttock with the King's Mark, and al&s;o the <HI>Omrahs</HI> under whom they Serve; and this is no ill Invention, to prevent the Troopers from lending their Hor&s;es one to another.</P>
<P>The foremention'd eminent Streets, which end over again&s;t the two Gates of the Ca&s;tle, and on the Plain, are about twenty five or thirty Paces broad, and extend in a direct Line as far as the Eye can di&s;cern, though that which comes out a|gain&s;t the Gate of <HI>Lahor</HI> is much longer than the other, but all the Buildings are like one another. There are Arches on both &s;ides of the Streets, flat on the top, without any Rooms over the &s;ame; neither are the Walks underneath intire, but the Arches are &s;eparated by Walls, the &s;pace be|tween which &s;erves &s;everal Handicrafts and Ar|ti&s;ts for Shops to work in in the day-time, and for Exchangers of Money to do their Bu&s;ine&s;s in, and Merchants to di&s;po&s;e their Commodities to Sale, which at Night they lock up in Warehou&s;es. The Arches over the&s;e Warehou&s;es are built un|der the Merchants Hou&s;es; which appear very fair at a di&s;tance, and are very convenient, for &s;tanding very high, they are not onely out of the Du&s;t, but &s;tand very cool, and being in a manner even with the flat Roof of the Arches, they walking on them, may look into the Street, and &s;leep on the &s;ame for coolne&s;s in the Night. But be&s;ides the&s;e two eminent Streets there are five others, which are not &s;o direct nor &s;treight, but very like them in all things el&s;e. Many other Streets indeed there are which run from all parts of the City, and have mo&s;t of them Arches, but becau&s;e they are built for Dwelling-hou&s;es for private People, who are not curious in the uniformity of their Buildings, they are neither &s;o &s;treight nor &s;o broad, nor &s;o firmly built as the re&s;t. In all the Streets &s;tand the Hou&s;es of the <HI>Man&s;ebdans</HI> or petty <HI>Omrahs,</HI> Per&s;ons of Judicature, Merchants and others, which are not meanly built. It is certain there are many which are built of Brick or other Stones, and divers of Clay, and cover'd with Straw, yet they are neverthele&s;s very convenient, having Gardens and Orchards belonging to them; they are al&s;o very hand&s;om within, for be&s;ides the good Furniture, the Straw Roofs are &s;upported by long, hard, and &s;trong Canes, and the Walls Plai&s;ter'd and Whitened.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the&s;e indifferent fair Hou&s;es, there are abundance of le&s;&s;er, which being built of Lome, &s;erve for Habitations for the Troopers, and other meaner People belonging to the <HI>Bazar</HI> and the King's Court.</P>
<P>By rea&s;on of the&s;e &s;light Hou&s;es <HI>Dely</HI> is very &s;ubject to Fire. <HI>Anno</HI> 1663. there were above &s;ixty thou&s;and Thatch'd Roofs con&s;um'd by the Flame, which was the greater, as being aug|mented by the &s;trong Winds that blow in the Summer, which made it &s;o fierce, that it de&s;troy'd many Camels and Hor&s;es, there being no time to &s;ave them, and al&s;o many of the King's Concu|bines, which having never been out of the <HI>Sera|glio,</HI> were &s;o ba&s;hful, that they cho&s;e rather to be burnt than be &s;av'd by &s;trange Men.</P>
<P>By rea&s;on of the&s;e &s;light Hou&s;es of Lome, <HI>Dely</HI> cannot be &s;aid to be any thing el&s;e than a com|pany of Villages joyn'd together, or rather a Camp with Tents, onely erected in a better order, and more convenient than u&s;uall in the Fields.</P>
<P>As to what concerns the Hou&s;es of the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> they &s;tand al&s;o in mo&s;t parts of the City, e&s;peci|ally along the Rivers, and in the Suburbs.</P>
<P>If a Hou&s;e in the&s;e warm Countreys bears the Name of Hand&s;om and Large, it is infallibly very convenient, <HI>viz.</HI> it is &s;eated in a place where the Wind can come to it from all Corners, e&s;pecially the Northern: it hath Gardens, Orchards, Fi&s;h|ponds, and Springs, large Vaults or Cellars, with great light Holes to let the Wind in at. The Inhabitants retiring into them in the heat of the day, &s;tay in them till about four or five a clock;
<PB N="205" REF="150">or el&s;e they have <HI>Cascanays,</HI> which are little Hou|&s;es of Straw, or &s;weet-&s;melling Roots, being very curiou&s;ly made, and commonly plac'd in the mid|dle of a Park, near a Pond or Spring, that the Ser|vants may with their Leather Jacks wet them on the out &s;ide.</P>
<P>The eminent Hou&s;es &s;tand in the mid&s;t of a large Square, and have not &s;loaping but flat Roofs, on which they may &s;leep in the Night.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Furni|ture of the Hou&s;es.</NOTE>As to what concerns the in&s;ide of the principal Hou&s;es, the Floors are cover'd with Cotton Quilts of four Fingers thick, with a white Linnen Cloth laid over them in the Summer, and with Carpets in the Winter. In the chief Chambers near the Wall mu&s;t al&s;o lie two or three Quilts cover'd with Silk, and embroider'd with Gold and Silver, for the Ma&s;ter of the Hou&s;e to &s;it on, or for Per|&s;ons of Quality that come to vi&s;it him: moreo|ver, on every Quilt lies a Cu&s;hion of Cloth of Gold; round about the Chamber again&s;t the Walls, &s;tand al&s;o many of the&s;e great Cu&s;hions of Flannel or flower'd Sattin to &s;it on. In the Walls, about four or five Foot from the Floor, they make &s;everal Windows of different fa&s;hions, even one with another, and adorn'd with Flower-pots and <HI>Porcelane</HI> Di&s;hes; but they have no Images of Men or Bea&s;ts, becau&s;e their Religion permits it not.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the foremention'd Hou&s;es in <HI>Dely</HI> are fur|ni&s;h'd after one and the &s;ame manner, though more or le&s;s rich according to the Quality of the Own|ers, by which means <HI>Dely</HI> is not without many fair Buildings, yet far inferior to our <HI>European.</HI></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding <HI>Dely</HI> is the Seat and Court of a mighty Prince, and the Staple for many Mer|chandi&s;es, yet it is not to be compar'd to <HI>London, Paris,</HI> or <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> the riche&s;t and mo&s;t valua|ble Commodities being oftner found in Ware|hou&s;es than Shops, for where there is one Shop furni&s;h'd with fine Cloths, Silk-Stuffs mixt with Gold and Silver, <HI>Turbants</HI> embroider'd with Gold, Cloth of Ti&s;&s;ue, and other rich Commodi|ties, there are above twenty which fell nothing but Butter, Rice, Barley, Pea&s;e, Wheat, and other Corn, the common Food not onely of the Heathens, who never eat Fle&s;h, but al&s;o of the vulgar <HI>Mahumetans</HI> and Soldidrs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dely</HI> &s;tor'd with divers &s;orts of Fruit from other Parts.</NOTE>In this City is a mo&s;t excellent Fruit-Market, and many Confectioners Shops, who ih the Sum|mer &s;ell all &s;orts of dry'd Fruit, brought thither from <HI>Per&s;ia, Balk, Bocara,</HI> and <HI>Samarcand,</HI> as Al|monds, Pi&s;tachoes, Nuts, Rai&s;ins; Plumbs, Apri|cocks, and others. In the Winter there are ex|cellent Grapes, brown and white, which being wrapt up in Cotton, are al&s;o brought from the foremention'd Countreys, as likewi&s;e Apples, two or three &s;orts of Pears, and rare Melons, which la&s;ting the whole Winter, are &s;old very dear.</P>
<P>There are no Fruits growing in this Countrey but Melons, which being not very good, are &s;old at a &s;mall rate. Per&s;ons of Quality who take care to have the Seed brought from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and Till or Manure their Ground well, may have excellent good Melons, yet they are very &s;carce, the Earth being &s;o barren, that after the fir&s;t year they dege|nerate.</P>
<P>There is another &s;ort of Fruit call'd <HI>Amba</HI> or <HI>Mangas,</HI> which for two Moneths in Summer are very plentiful and cheap.</P>
<P>There are likewi&s;e all the year round <HI>Patecues,</HI> or Water-Melons.</P>

<P>In the <HI>Bazars</HI> are &s;everal Cook Shops where Meat is dre&s;s'd, but after a &s;lutti&s;h manner; be|&s;ides, their Meat is very unwhol&s;om, for they commonly roa&s;t or boyl a piece of a Hor&s;e or Ca|mel, or of an Ox that dy'd in a Ditch; &s;o that all Per&s;ons who will eat good Meat, mu&s;t dre&s;s it in their own Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t parts of the City are Shambles, where Fle&s;h is expos'd to Sale; but the Buyers mu&s;t take &s;pecial care that they buy not Mutton in &s;tead of Goats-fle&s;h, becau&s;e both their Beef and Mutton is very feaveri&s;h, windy, and bad to dige&s;t, though well enough ta&s;ted.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Victuals in this Countrey is a raw Buck, which is not &s;old in Joynts by Butchers, but alive, &s;o that if any Per&s;on hath a mind to it, he mu&s;t buy a whole Buck, which is very inconveni|ent, becau&s;e the Fle&s;h, though kill'd in the Morn|ing, will be tainted before Night.</P>
<P>They have no Capons in this Countrey, the Inhabitants whereof are more compa&s;&s;ionate to Bea&s;ts than Men, whom they bereave of their Genitals to &s;erve them in the <HI>Seraglio;</HI> but in the Market are abundance of Hens, which are cheap and good; and among&s;t others there are a &s;ort of little Hens with black Feathers, which are very dainty, and therefore dear.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o Pigeons to be &s;old, but no young ones, becau&s;e they account it criminal to kill them.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o Phea&s;ants, but much &s;maller than ours, which are taken in Nets, and brought alive to the Market, as they do Ducks and other Fowl.</P>
<P>As to what concerns the Fi&s;h, there are few which love it, notwith&s;tanding there are &s;ome very good, e&s;peciall two &s;orts; the one is call'd <HI>Hinghala,</HI> and the other, re&s;embling our Carps, is call'd <HI>Rau.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The De&s;crip|tion of the Ca&s;tle.</NOTE>The Ca&s;tle, of which we have before made mention, comprehends the <HI>Seraglio</HI> and other Royal Structures; but they re&s;emble not the <HI>Eu|ropean,</HI> nor need they be like them for it is &s;uffici|ent that they have the &s;plendor and &s;trength which this Climate requites. There is nothing remark|able at the Entrance, except two great Elephants of Stone, which &s;tand on each &s;ide of the Gate; on the one &s;its the Image of <HI>Jemel,</HI> the famous <HI>Raja</HI> of <HI>Chitor;</HI> on the other, that of <HI>Polta</HI> his Bro|ther.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the two Heroes, who with their Mo|ther, more valiant than they, vex'd the <HI>Great Mo|gol Ecbar,</HI> and &s;hew'd excellent proofs of their Valour in the Towns which he Be&s;ieg'd, re&s;olving rather to die with their Mother, than become &s;ub|ject to the <HI>Mogol.</HI> By rea&s;on of this unheard of Valour, their Enemies them&s;elves have thought them worthy to have the two foremetion'd Sta|tues erected in honor of them.</P>
<P>Having pa&s;s'd through the Gate of the Ca&s;tle, you come to a long broad Street, which is divided into two by a Brook of running Watet, and hath on each &s;ide a long <HI>Divan</HI> of five or &s;ix Foot high, and four broad, with &s;everal Arches like Gates.</P>
<P>On this long <HI>Divan</HI> Scriveners, Regi&s;ters, and
<PB N="206" REF="151">others have their &s;everal Offices out of the Pre&s;s and Crowd of the People which pa&s;s by them along the Street, which lies lower than their Shops, on which al&s;o the <HI>Man&s;ebdars</HI> or petty <HI>Omrahs</HI> keep Guard in the Night.</P>
<P>There is a Brook running through the mid&s;t of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> which fills other Moats with its Wa|ter, and hath its original out of a River three or four Leagues from <HI>Dely,</HI> whence it is convey'd in a Channel cro&s;s the Plains, and between many Rocks, which have been open'd with great difficulty and hard Labor.</P>
<P>Coming through the other Gate of the Ca&s;tle, there opens another large and broad Street, which al&s;o hath its <HI>Divans</HI> on each &s;ide with Shops. This Street being properly a <HI>Bazar,</HI> is very com|modious during the Rainy and Summer Sea&s;on, becau&s;e it is covere'd with a long and broad Arch, which on the top hath a fair <HI>Cupula,</HI> through which it receives Light.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e two Streets are &s;everal other le&s;&s;er on the right and left &s;ide, which lead to the Lodg|ings where the <HI>Omrahs</HI> watch twenty four hours once a Week by turns. The&s;e Lodgings are very &s;tately, the <HI>Omrahs</HI> beautifying them at their own Co&s;ts and Charge, and are commonly the great <HI>Divans,</HI> which are oppo&s;ite to a Square, interlac'd with &s;everal Brooks of Water and Springs. Du|ring the time that they are on the Guard, the King &s;ends them all their Victuals ready dre&s;s'd, which they receive with great Ceremony and Reve|rence, repeating three &s;everal times the <HI>Ta&s;lin</HI> or Thanks, and laying their Hands upon their Heads, turn their Faces towards the King's Lodgings.</P>
<P>There are yet many more <HI>Divans</HI> and Tents erected in &s;everal places, which are the Apart|ments of divers Officers.</P>
<P>Moreover, there are a great number of <HI>Carca|nays,</HI> which are Shops wherein Handicraft&s;men follow &s;everal Employments, as Embroiderers, Gold&s;miths, Painters, Taylors, Shoemakers, and Silkweavers, each in a peculiar Shop.</P>
<P>All the&s;e Trade&s;men come every Morning to work in this <HI>Carcanays,</HI> and &s;taying there all day, return home to their Hou&s;es in the Evening, each Man living very peaceably and quiet, none aiming to be higher than their Condition hath allotted them; for a Taylor breeds his Son a Taylor, and &s;o the re&s;t, and no Per&s;on conver&s;es with any Man but tho&s;e of his own Trade; which Cu&s;tom is punctually ob&s;erv'd, not onely by the <HI>Heathens,</HI> who are oblig'd thereto by their Laws, but al&s;o among&s;t the <HI>Mahumetans,</HI> which is the occa&s;ion of many beautiful Virgins living unmarried, when as they might Match to the rai&s;ing their Fortunes, if their Parents would permit them to Marry a Man of another Trade or Quality which they account meaner than theirs.</P>
<P>After having pa&s;s'd all the&s;e Places before mention'd, you come to the <HI>Amacas,</HI> which is a large Square with <HI>Piazzaes,</HI> which have no Hou&s;es over them, but are divided by a Wall with a lit|tle Door or Gate, through which you walk out of one part into another.</P>
<P>Beyond the great Gate, which is in the mid&s;t of one of the &s;ides of this Square, you come to a large <HI>Divan,</HI> which is all open towards the &s;ide of the Court, and is call'd <HI>Nagar-canay,</HI> becau&s;e it is the place where the Trumpetters, or rather Cymbal-players are, who in their Turns play both day and night. But this &s;eems at fir&s;t a &s;trange &s;ound in the Ears of Strangers who are not us'd to it, there being &s;ometimes ten or twelve of the&s;e Trumpetters, and as many Cimbal-players, who play all together.</P>
<P>They have Trumpets which they call <HI>Carna,</HI> a Cubit and a half long, with an opening at the bottom of a Foot diameter. So likewi&s;e there are Cymbals of Copper or Iron, half a Yard wide, from whence one may judge of the noi&s;e which they make; their &s;ound is &s;o har&s;h in the Ears of Strangers, and &s;o loud, that they cannot endure to hear the &s;ame; yet cu&s;tom makes it plea&s;ant, e&s;pe|cially in the Night, when it is heard at a di&s;tance on the tops of Hou&s;es; wherefore tho&s;e that are appointed to play, are plac'd on high at a di&s;tance from the King's Lodgings.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to the great Gate of the Court, over which this <HI>Nagar-canay</HI> is kept, is a &s;pacious Hall, built on &s;everal high Columns, and open on three &s;ides, all which look towards the Court. The Pil|lars and Floor of this Hall are gilded and painted.

<P>At the end of the great Street <HI>Bazari Colan</HI> &s;tands a <HI>Pagode</HI> built in honor of <HI>Mahadeu,</HI> to which a great number of People re&s;ort daily: moreover, the Street which leads thither is always full of People, not onely tho&s;e that go thither to their Devotion, and tho&s;e that return from thence, but al&s;o abundance of poor People, who &s;tand|ing on both &s;ides of the Street, beg Alms of tho&s;e that pa&s;s by. The <HI>Pagode,</HI> which is an in|different large Building, hath a long narrow En|try almo&s;t under Ground, for it goes down with &s;everal Steps, which makes it &s;eem to be rather a Way leading into a Cave, than a <HI>Pagode.</HI> By rea|&s;on of the abundance of People that flock thither, and the narrowne&s;s of the Way, there is always a great Crowd: At the Entrance hang &s;everal Bells, which the Pilgrims gingling at their going in, make a continual noi&s;e with them.

<P>In the middle of the foremention'd Court &s;tands a <HI>Pagode,</HI> on each &s;ide of who&s;e Entrance are plac'd two great Elephants of black Marble; on one of them &s;its the Image of the Founder of this Stru|cture, the Roof whereof, as al&s;o of &s;ome of the other Buildings, are round like a Vault.

Within you &s;ee no|thing but three ob&s;cure Angles at the further end, in every one of which &s;tand three of the foremen|tion'd Images, and before the middlemo&s;t of them a burning Lamp. A <HI>Brahman</HI> or Prie&s;t commonly performs their religious Service after the follow|ing manner: Fir&s;t he adorns the Images with Flowers and Garlands, which tho&s;e that come thi|ther to their Devotion bring along with them for an Offering. No Man or Woman is permitted to approach this holy Place, unle&s;s barefoot, and they are to make their Offerings kneeling before the Rail which inclo&s;es the Images.

<P>Both within and without the City are many plea&s;ant Gardens and Banquetting-hou&s;es, and in the mid&s;t of them Ponds and Wells of clear and &s;weet Water, in which the Inhabitants Bathe them&s;elves in hot Weather.</P>
<P>By rea&s;on of Gardens and Orchards in and about the City, it &s;eems to Strangers to be rather a plea&s;ant Grove than a City. It hath al&s;o very large and populous Suburbs, and among&s;t others one call'd <HI>Begamboer.</HI></P>
<P>Ea&s;tward from the City the <HI>Benjans</HI> have built an Ho&s;pital, wherein they cure all wounded Birds, Bea&s;ts, and other Animals.</P>
<P>There are twenty five eminent Villages under the Juri&s;diction of <HI>Amadabath,</HI> and under them two thou&s;and nine hundred ninety eight Hamlets, which pay Tribute to the great Villages.</P>
<P>On one &s;ide of the City runs a Way which is &s;ix Leagues long, call'd <HI>Bag-Schaban,</HI> to a great and plea&s;ant Village, and being planted on both &s;ides with &s;tanding Trees, hath many cro&s;s Ways, all which are as cool and &s;hady as a Wood.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A &s;tately Tomb.</NOTE>Near the City is a Tomb erected by King <HI>Reer,</HI> in honor of a Tutor whom he lov'd exceedingly, in hopes to make immortal by this &s;tately Structure, who&s;e Walls and Floors are all of po|li&s;h'd Marble. There are three Gardens belong|ing to the &s;ame, one of which is &s;urrounded with four hundred Pillars of Porphyrie Stones of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> order. Near it is a large <HI>Tank</HI> or Pond of Water, inclos'd with a Stone Wall, in which are many Windows, which yield a plea&s;ant Pro|&s;pect on the Water.</P>
<P>At <HI>Se&s;ques,</HI> not above half an hours walking from thence, are the &s;epulchral Monuments of &s;e|veral Princes of <HI>Cambaya,</HI> erected in a Temple, which is much frequented by the &s;uper&s;titious <HI>Ben|jans.</HI></P>
<P>A Mile from the City is the Garden and Pa|lace of <HI>Chanchonna,</HI> Son to the great <HI>Byram, Chan</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>The Countrey of <HI>Cambaya</HI> to <HI>Amadabat,</HI> is for the mo&s;t part de&s;olate and uncultivated. In the Way are &s;everal Pits, each above thirty Yards deep, in which is &s;alt Water, though at a great di&s;tance from the Sea; it is drawn out by Oxen.</P>
<P>The Countrey about <HI>Amadabath</HI> is nothing but a va&s;t Wilderne&s;s, and the Ways very du&s;ty and trouble&s;om for Travellers. The High-ways are Hedg'd in on both &s;ides with a certain Fruitle&s;s and Leafle&s;s Plant, which &s;hoots forth onely little long Stalks, of a deep Green, both Winter and Summer, out of which, when broke a&s;under, drops a milky Juice like that of green Figs, and being very &s;harp, eats into that part of the Skin on which it drops. The Fields which border the High|ways, are full of <HI>Ambe</HI>-trees, which bear a Fruit like great Olives, and al&s;o af <HI>Tamarind</HI>-trees.</P>
<P>Without the City are many great Tombs of Marble, erected by the <HI>Moors,</HI> and are much &s;tate|lier than their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>A League and a half from the City lies a great Village call'd <HI>Zirkes,</HI> or <HI>Sirke&s;ia,</HI> where there is a very magnificent Tomb, the whole Structure with its Floors being all of poli&s;h'd Marble, and di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd into three parts; one whereof re&s;ts on a a hundred and forty Marble Pillars, each thirty Foot high, curiou&s;ly adorn'd with Fe&s;tunes and Pede&s;tals, after the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Order. This Stru|cture is &s;aid to be the Tomb of one <HI>Cacis,</HI> Tutor to one of the Kings of <HI>Zurratte,</HI> to whom they a&s;cribe great Sanctity and Wonders; and that the &s;aid King, who with three other Kings lies buried in another Chappel, built the &s;ame in commemora|tion of his Tutor. At a certain time of the year, mo&s;t of the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> come hither in Pilgri|mage, firmly believing thereby to obtain pardon for their &s;ins. On one &s;ide of it is a large Pond.</P>
<P>About a Mile from the City is another fair Tomb, of an eminent <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Merchant call'd <HI>Hajom Majom,</HI> who being enamor'd of the Beauty of his Daughter, and threupon Ravi&s;hing her, was Beheaded by the King's Command, and bu|ried here with all his Family; wherefore the Inhabitants to this day call the &s;ame <HI>Betychint,</HI> that is, <HI>The uncover'd &s;hame of your Daughter.</HI></P>
<P>In the Suburb <HI>Begamboer,</HI> near a River, lies one of the King's Gardens call'd <HI>Schvchbag,</HI> which be|ing very large, is &s;urrounded with a &s;trong Wall; at one end of it &s;tands a plea&s;ant Banquetting-hou&s;e,

<P>The Water of the foremention'd River is con|vey'd round the &s;aid Banquetting-hou&s;e, not far from which you come into another Garden, over a high Stone Bridge four hundred Paces long; and though this Garden be but &s;mall, yet it is very plea&s;ant and high, and hath al&s;o at the end again&s;t the Bridge a brave Banquetting-hou&s;e. The Wa|ter in the droughty Sea&s;on is drawn up but of the Wells by Oxen, and put into two great Stone Ci|&s;terns before the Banquetting-hou&s;e. This Gar|den, wherein commonly young Women Bathe them&s;elves in the foremention'd Ci&s;terns, is call'd <HI>Nicunabag,</HI> that is, <HI>The Garden of Precious Stones,</HI> and is &s;aid to have been made by a beautiful and rich Lady.</P>
<P>There is yet another delightful Garden with a Banquetting-hou&s;e, which was built by the <HI>Great Mogol Ecbar,</HI> in commemoration of his conquering the la&s;t King of <HI>Zurratte,</HI> call'd <HI>Sultan Mahomed Begeran,</HI> in that very place; whereby the King|dom of <HI>Zurratte</HI> became &s;ubject to the <HI>Great Mogol.</HI></P>

<P>Six Leagues from the &s;aid City al&s;o lies ano|ther Town call'd <HI>Mamadabad,</HI> on the Bank of a plea&s;ant River; on the North &s;ide of it is a fair Palace. The Inhabitants of this Town are for the mo&s;t part Weavers.</P>

<P>The City <HI>Surratte</HI> is very populous, and inha|bited partly by native <HI>Indians,</HI> and partly by Stran|gers and Foreigners, for Trade.</P>

<P>Among&s;t the Foreigners or Strangers, the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> drive the greate&s;t Trade here, be&s;ides which there are <HI>Portugue&s;es, Arabians, Per|&s;ians, Armenians, Turks,</HI> and <HI>Jews;</HI> wherefore <HI>Suratte</HI> is accounted one of the mo&s;t eminent Ci|ties for Trade in all <HI>India,</HI> both in re&s;pect of its Haven, and becau&s;e the convenience of carrying the Commodities through all <HI>Suratte</HI> from <HI>Cam|baya</HI> and other Places, draws the Merchants thi|ther. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Traders have many fair Hou&s;es in the City, very convenient to dwell in, and al&s;o to &s;tow their Goods.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chief Re|marks in <HI>Su|ratte.</HI></NOTE>Among&s;t the Remarks which this City hath, the chie&s;e&s;t is a mighty Pond with divers Angles, rais'd with Free-&s;tone in a manner like Steps, on which the People de&s;cend to the Water; in the middle of which lies an I&s;le that none can have acce&s;s to but in a Boats, or by &s;wimming. On one &s;ide of this Pond is a pretty long, broad, and deep Channel or Moat, over which lie &s;everal Bridges, that lead to another larger Pond, which here would be accounted a great Lake, though there it be look'd upon as a very &s;mall one. This al&s;o hath many Angles, and is wall'd about with Free|&s;tone, with which al&s;o the &s;ides of the Moat are &s;trengthned. Between the great and le&s;&s;er Ponds near the Moat &s;tands a Tomb of two eminent <HI>Ma|humetans</HI> which kill'd one another. This Pond or Pool was in the beginning of this Age made by a rich Inhabitant of this City, with the expence of his whole E&s;tate, in&s;omuch that his Daughter be|came mi&s;erably poor, none of the Town&s;men once relieving her, though her Father had for their ac|commodation and the publick good, exhau&s;ted all his Trea&s;ure.

<P>Without the City, towards the Sea &s;ide, is a every plea&s;ant Garden, which formerly belong'd to the King of <HI>Suratte:</HI> It is but little, yet full of Trees, Plants and Herbs.</P>

<P>The Weather is exceeding hot here in <HI>April, May,</HI> and <HI>June,</HI> and very unhealthful, occa&s;ioning Feavers and other Di&s;tempers, but when it begins to Rain, the Wind blows very &s;trong, and tem|pers the exce&s;&s;ive Heat; but in the dry Sea&s;on, it it hath this inconveniency, <HI>viz.</HI> it draws up the Du&s;t like a Cloud, and di&s;per&s;es the &s;ame on Tra|vellers, to their great annoyance.</P>
<P>In the rainy Sea&s;on, e&s;pecially in <HI>May</HI> and <HI>June,</HI> they Till their Lands, and Sowe their Corn, which being, moi&s;tned by the Rain, produces &s;o rich and plentiful a Harve&s;t, and &s;uch abundance of Grain, that all the adjacent Countreys are &s;upply'd therewith: for <HI>Surratte</HI> (according to <HI>Lin&s;chot</HI>) is the fruitfulle&s;t Spot of Land in all <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>The Countrey produces great quantities of Beans and Wheat, but much bigger and whiter than ours; al&s;o Barley, Rice, Tares, and Pea&s;e, which are le&s;s than tho&s;e which grow in <HI>Europe;</HI> Lin&s;eed, and a &s;mall Seed call'd <HI>Thill,</HI> out of which they pre&s;s abundance of Oyl.

<P>The Fruit <HI>Mangas</HI> is much better here than in <HI>Ormuz,</HI> but not &s;o big, yet of a more delicate &s;mell, and having a &s;mall Kernel in the middle.

The Wine which drops from the foremen|tion'd Tree in the Night, is plea&s;ant and whol&s;om, but that which drops out of the &s;ame in the day|time, being &s;poil'd by the Heat, is very hurtful for the Brain: It produces likewi&s;es plenty of Rice, Wheat, Barley, all &s;orts of Rice, and Cotton, but not in &s;uch abundance as in <HI>Nederbaer,</HI> and the adjacent Countreys.</P>
<P>The Mountains of <HI>Pindaetche</HI> are fertile in the production of Corn and other Grain, the Soil be|ing Clay mix'd with black Earth.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of this Place make little Chee&s;es, which are very dry and Salt.</P>

<P>The Trees and Fields are green all the year, but the Gra&s;s in the Summer is &s;corch'd up by the Sun; neither is the Gra&s;s Mow'd here as in <HI>Europe,</HI> but ju&s;t when they have occa&s;ion for it, and as much at a time as may &s;erve two or three days.</P>

<P>The Countrey round about <HI>Brodera</HI> and the ad|jacent Villages is very fruitful, and produces Wheat, Barley, Rice, and other Grain, as al&s;o Cotton in great abundance.</P>
<P>The whole Coa&s;t of <HI>Bazaim</HI> hath plenty of Rice, Pea&s;e, and other Corn, be&s;ides Butter, Oyl, and <HI>Coco</HI>-nuts.</P>
<P>There are many <HI>Hiacinthes</HI> in this Kingdom, as al&s;o Diamonds, Pearls, Granads, Topas's, <HI>Corna|lines, Spinellaes,</HI> and Amethi&s;ts, be&s;ides Alaba&s;ter, red Marble, <HI>Hematites,</HI> or Blood-&s;tones, and Ja&s;|pers, which are but little regarded.

They varni&s;h many Ships therewith, as al&s;o Ta|bles, Cabinets, Stools, Bed&s;teads, and other Wood-woork, which is the occa&s;ion that great quantities thereof are us'd in <HI>Surratte.</HI> The Enamel which they u&s;e with their Silver and Gold-works, as Hafts of Knives, and the like, they fill up with Wax within, and cover the &s;ame with Gold &s;o neatly, that unle&s;s a Stranger were inform'd there|of, he could not di&s;cover it from ma&s;&s;y Gold.</P>
<P>Near the Village <HI>More,</HI> twenty nine Leagues from the City of <HI>Surratte,</HI> is a Spring, which ca&s;ts up boyling hot Water at the foot of a Mountain, out of a hard Rock; a piece of Meat wrapt in Callico, is boyl'd in a &s;hort time therein, neither need they put Salt to it, becau&s;e the Water is Salt, yet of a good ta&s;te, as if <HI>Alants</HI> Roots had been boyl'd therein.</P>
<P>Six clays Journey from the City <HI>Cambaya,</HI> is a Mountain, which produces <HI>Cornalines</HI> and <HI>Chalce|dony;</HI> which la&s;t the Inhabitants (according to <HI>Barbo&s;a</HI>) call <HI>Bacayores.</HI></P>
<P>A League from the City <HI>Brotcha</HI> is another rich Mine of <HI>Chalcedony</HI> and white Agats, which are commonly carry'd to <HI>Cambaya,</HI> and not to <HI>Brotcha;</HI> they make abundance of round and oval Di&s;hes, and other &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, of the &s;ame, for an Or|nament in their Chambers.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t Places of <HI>Surratte</HI> are abundance of Oxen, Cowes, Sheep from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> with large Tails, Goats, and Buffaloes, which yield good Milk and Butter, and Fle&s;h which ta&s;tes like Beef, though &s;poil'd by the Heat of the Countrey. The Oxen no way differ from ours, onely they have a Bunch on their Shoulder.</P>
<P>Between the City of <HI>Amadabat</HI> and <HI>Surrate</HI> are many Goats, Stags, and wild Swine, Gee&s;e, and other Fowl, in great abundance; the Inhabitants &s;eldom kill any of them, e&s;pecially the <HI>Benjans.</HI> There are al&s;o many Hor&s;es, not onely of the Breed of the Countrey, but divers others, which being brought out of <HI>Tartary, Per&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Arabia,</HI> are &s;old at a dear rate, becau&s;e they are accounted the be&s;t of all <HI>India;</HI> and they not onely take care to provide a Servant for every Hor&s;e, but al&s;o give them good Provender, <HI>viz.</HI> a &s;ort of ground and boil'd Beans call'd <HI>Danna,</HI> and both Morning and Evening two pound of Barley Meal, mix'd with a pound and a half of Butter, and a pound of Sugar.

<PB N="217" REF="160">Rhinocerots, Drommedaries, and Elephants, which are kept by the <HI>Mogol</HI> and Nobility in the Woods.</P>
<P>There are an innumerable company of wild Bea&s;ts, as Stags, Goats, <HI>Elands,</HI> wild Hogs, A&s;&s;es, who&s;e Fle&s;h the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> eat in &s;tead of Lamb, and Hares, which all Per&s;ons are permit|ted to catch, except at the time when the King and his Nobles are Hunting; for then it is forbidden on pain of Death.</P>
<P>Moreover, the Woods are al&s;o the Rece&s;&s;es for Lyons, Tygers, Leopards (but neither Bears nor Wolves,) mad Dogs, which are call'd <HI>Jekkalla,</HI> abundance of Catamountains, and a Bea&s;t, which being almo&s;t like a Ferret, with a Tail like a Squir|rel, doth great mi&s;chief to the Fruit, in&s;omuch that the Husbandmen are forced to watch adays in the Fields when their Corn is ripe, to keep them from &s;poiling it.</P>
<P>There are likewi&s;e abundance of tame Fowls, as Hens, Cocks, Capons, Peacocks, Gee&s;e, Ducks, and Crop-Gee&s;e, which breed near the Rivers or Pools; be&s;ides Partridges, (which are there tame) and Pigeons. The Birds of prey are the&s;e, Fal|cons, Hawks, Kites, Parrots, and other Birds not known to us in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Both within and without the City <HI>Amadabat</HI> are great numbers of Catamountains, which bree|ding in the Woods, fearle&s;ly frequent the Hou&s;es, and do great damage to tho&s;e that deal in Fruit, as Dates, Almonds, Figs, Rai&s;ins, and the like; of which they take what they like be&s;t.</P>
<P>Between the City <HI>Cambaya</HI> and <HI>Amadabat,</HI> near the Village <HI>Mater,</HI> are abundance of excellent blood-colour'd Squirrels, with curious large Tails; which breeding on Trees, leap nimbly from one to another.</P>
<P>Many Bats, which are as big as Hens, and have Heads re&s;embling tho&s;e of Cats, frequent the Woods, and are by &s;ome call'd Flying-Cats. Be|tween <HI>Cambaya</HI> and <HI>Amadabat</HI> are likewi&s;e Bats as big as Ravens.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o great numbers of Crows, which flying through the Windows into the Hou&s;es, take the Meat out of the Di&s;hes without any fear of the People that are pre&s;ent: They commonly &s;it on the Backs of the Buffaloes, and peck off their Hair; which is the rea&s;on that mo&s;t of the fore|mention'd Bea&s;ts in the&s;e Parts are bald: nor have they any other way to free them&s;elves of the &s;aid Fowls, but to run up to their Throats into a Mo|ra&s;s.</P>
<P>Rats al&s;o breed here in great abundance, and &s;ome of them are &s;o big that no Cats dare venture to &s;eize on them; and oftentimes throw down Hou&s;es, by undermining the Walls and Founda|tions thereof: they do likewi&s;e great mi&s;chief to the Plants and Trees.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants are daily much infe&s;ted with Bugs, which filling the Hou&s;es in great &s;warms, &s;ting the People.</P>
<P>The Rivers, e&s;pecially the <HI>Indus</HI> and others, abound with all manner of delicate Fi&s;h, <HI>viz.</HI> Carps, Bremes, Eels, Trouts, Shrimps, and many other <HI>European</HI> Fi&s;hes, be&s;ides &s;uch as are peculiar to tho&s;e Parts. In the Stream <HI>Indus</HI> breed likewi&s;e many Crocodiles or <HI>Caimans.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Serpents, and other noxious Creatures.</NOTE>About <HI>Amadabat</HI> are abundance of poy&s;onous Serpents and Scorpions, which in all parts of <HI>In|dia</HI> are not alike venomous: for the Sting of a Scorpion on the I&s;land of <HI>Great Java,</HI> occa&s;ions great &s;welling, and exceeding pain; but is ea&s;ily cur'd, if Medicines be apply'd thereunto within the &s;pace of twelve hours after; but if any one be &s;tung by a Scorpion on the Main, he certainly dies within the &s;pace of three hours, if he doth not in|&s;tantly cut the wounded part till it bleeds, and then anointing it with Oyl of Scorpions, &s;ear it with a red hot Iron. Moreover the oylie moi|&s;ture, which is extracted from the Scorpion which hath &s;tung the Party, is al&s;o an excellent Remedy, if immediately laid on the Wound. The Scorpi|ons re&s;emble in &s;hape the Cra-fi&s;h or Lob&s;ters. Before they are boil'd they have a little round Tail, which erecting it &s;elf, reclines backward; at the end thereof is the Sting, which they never draw in, or put out, like other venomous Crea|tures, but always have the &s;ame ready to &s;ting tho&s;e which approach them: The Sting is very hard, &s;harp, and long, like an Iron Hook. The Scorpions, and another &s;ort of Vermin call'd <HI>Mille|pes,</HI> from its number of Feet, breed for the mo&s;t part on old decay'd Walls.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o a &s;ort of Scorpions with two Heads, <HI>viz.</HI> one before, and the other behind the Tail; and it is &s;aid that they move one Head one year, and the other another year; and are by &s;ome in <HI>Greek</HI> call'd' <GAP DESC="foreign"> which &s;ignifies a thing that can go backwards or forwards.</P>
<P>The&s;e two-headed Serpents have occa&s;ioned great Di&s;putes among&s;t the Philo&s;ophers: for &s;ome, as <HI>Aelianus, Pliny, Lucan, Galen, Nierenbergh.</HI> and <HI>Olearius,</HI> certainly believe that there are really &s;uch Serpents: But <HI>Andreas Matthiolus,</HI> in his Ex|planation of <HI>Dio&s;corides,</HI> and <HI>John Faber Linceus,</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of <HI>Mexico,</HI> contradicts this Opinion, and looks upon it as a fabulous Tradition, judging this mi&s;take to proceed from hence, <HI>viz.</HI> becau&s;e the forementioned Serpents are as thick at their Tail as at their Head; &s;o that there can be no di&s;tinction made; moreover, that they creep as well back wards as forwards, and have veno|mous Stings in their Tails as well as in their Heads.</P>
<P>Yet <HI>Nierenbergh</HI> relates, that an eminent Phi|lo&s;opher call'd <HI>Cortavilla,</HI> had one of the foremen|tion'd two-headed Serpents at <HI>Madrid.</HI> Moreover <HI>Ge&s;ner,</HI> that a two-headed Serpent was taken in the Sea near the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Shore.</P>
<P>This Countrey is al&s;o exceeding pe&s;ter'd with little Pi&s;mires, which are no &s;mall annoiance to the Inhabitants, who can &s;carce &s;et any Meat out of their Hands, but in a moment &s;everal hundreds crawl upon the &s;ame; which to prevent, they ge|nerally keep in their Hou&s;es &s;tone Troughs full of Water, in the middle of which laying a great Stone, they lay their Meat upon it, in a Cupboard made for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>By rea&s;on of the many Woods and Trees that are about and near <HI>Amadabat,</HI> there are great plenty of wild Bea&s;ts and Fowls, e&s;pecially Parrots of all &s;orts; &s;ome whereof are very big, and are by &s;e|veral <HI>Europeans</HI> call'd <HI>Indian Ravens;</HI> and &s;ome be|ing no bigger than Pigeons, are for their &s;weet Voices call'd <HI>Cacatu:</HI> They are of a yellowi&s;h colour, and have a Tuft of Feathers on their Heads: They make their Ne&s;ts under the Roofs of Hou&s;es, and are found in great numbers in mo&s;t Towns of all <HI>India.</HI> Others which are le&s;s, are red and green, and building their Ne&s;ts of long withered Gra&s;s, make them fa&s;t to the Boughs of Trees, that &s;o they may be freed from Vermin.

<P>Some affirm, that their Law forbids them to eat of any thing that enjoyed Life, except in times of War or great Nece&s;&s;ity; for then they are per|mitted to eat Mutton, Goats-fle&s;h, Veni&s;on, Poul|trey, and Fi&s;h, and all manner of Fle&s;h, except that of Cows, Oxen, Hor&s;es, Camels, Elephants, and the like Bea&s;ts, which they account a deadly &s;in to kill; but they chiefly ab&s;tain from Cows or Ox-fle&s;h, affirming, that they will rather eat their Father or Mothers Fle&s;h: In which Point of Re|ligion they agree with the <HI>Benjans.</HI></P>

This wor&s;hipping of Fire hath its original from one <HI>Zertoo&s;t</HI> their Law-giver, who, as their
<PB N="220" REF="162">Tradition goes, a&s;cended to Heaven, and brought down a portion of Fire, which God gave him, together with the Book of their Laws. They al|ledge moreover, that <HI>Zertoo&s;t</HI> a&s;cending to Hea|ven, &s;aw not God in his full glory, but that he &s;poke with him over a great Fire, out of which God gave him the &s;aid portion, and al&s;o endued him with &s;ome of his Divine Power. They &s;ay likewi&s;e, That the Fire which he brought out of Heaven, was a living Fire, which could not be extingui&s;h'd by any means, and therefore that it had Divine Wor&s;hip a&s;crib'd to it. But it is not certainly believ'd among&s;t them, that the fore|mention'd Fire hath hitherto been pre&s;erved; however, they are permitted to make another Fire of &s;everall Materials, which they are to keep al|ways burning, and to wor&s;hip according to the Commands of their Law.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Cere|monies of Fire-wor&s;hip.</NOTE>Their grand Ceremonies of Fire-wor&s;hip are at pre&s;ent perform'd in <HI>Surratte,</HI> on a Place call'd <HI>Nuncery,</HI> where the chief Prie&s;thood of this Sect re&s;ide, and, according to their relation, have kept the Fire con&s;tantly burning above two hundred and fifty years. This Fire is by them in their Lan|guage call'd <HI>Antisbehur,</HI> that is, <HI>Sacred Fire.</HI></P>
<P>The wor&s;hipping of this Fire, which the <HI>Di|&s;toor</HI> or <HI>Herbood</HI> (that is the High-Prie&s;t) keeps &s;o carefully, that he never lets the &s;ame go out, is perform'd in the following manner:</P>
<P>As often as the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> meet to wor&s;hip the Fire, the <HI>Di&s;toor</HI> or <HI>Herbood</HI> tells them, That the Fire was given from God to <HI>Zertoo&s;t,</HI> as a part of his Power and Glory; and that he had al&s;o given him a Law which taught him to wor&s;hip the &s;ame, and was confirm'd by many Miracles; there|fore they mu&s;t e&s;teem it &s;acred and holy, and wor&s;hip and reverence the &s;ame, as being a part of God him&s;elf, and of the &s;ame E&s;&s;ence and like|ne&s;s with him, or at lea&s;t differing little from him; that they mu&s;t love all things that re&s;emble the, as the Sun and Moon, which were made of the &s;ame, and are two te&s;timonies of God, and would come to be Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t them, if they neg|lected this their Duty, to which they were &s;o &s;trictly commanded. Moreover, he admoni&s;hes them to wor&s;hip God, and beg pardon of him, if accidentally they &s;hould &s;pill any Water in the foremention'd Element of Fire, which being &s;o u&s;eful for Mankind, might thereby happen to be extingui&s;h'd; and not to &s;pit in the &s;ame, or throw any unclean thing into it to make it burn. They therefore keep always Fire in their Hou&s;es, and will never blow out a Candle, Lamp, or any other Light, or quench Fire with Water, though their Hou&s;es &s;hould be all in a Flame, but endea|vour to &s;mother the &s;ame with Earth; for they ac|count it an ill omen, and a &s;ign of God's anger, when the Fire in their Hou&s;es chances to go out, and they be forc'd to fetch Fire out of other Hou|&s;es to kindle it again.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The initiation of their Chil|dren.</NOTE>As to what concerns the Initiating of their Children; &s;o &s;oon as a Child comes into the World, the <HI>Daroo</HI> or Prie&s;t goes to the Parents Hou&s;e, and having enquired into the Hour and Minute of the Infants Birth, he fir&s;t erects a Scheme, then con&s;ults with the Father and Mo|ther about naming of the Child; which as &s;oon as they have agreed upon, the Mother, in pre&s;ence of the whole Company, gives the Child its Name, without any other Ceremony; which done, the Mother and Father taking the Child, follow the <HI>Daroo</HI> to the <HI>Eggaree</HI> or Temple, where the Prie&s;t takes clear Water, which he &s;tirs in the Bark of a certain Tree growing near <HI>Ye&s;d</HI> in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> call'd <HI>Holma,</HI> on which it is affirm'd the Sun never makes any &s;hadow, and at la&s;t taking up a handful of the &s;aid Water, &s;prinkles the Child therewith, and prays to God that he would clean&s;e the Child from his Fathers and Mothers Uncleanne&s;s: which &s;aid, he leaves the Infant with the Parents. When the Child is attain'd to the &s;eventh year of its Age, and judg'd fit to be receiv'd and made a Member of their Church, the Parents carry it to the Temple to be in&s;tructed; where the <HI>Daroo</HI> teaches the Youth &s;everal Prayers, and in&s;tructs him in his Religion. The Child being perfect herein, repeats all the Prayers which he hath learn'd, over a Fire, with a Cloth ty'd about his Head, which covers his Mouth and No&s;trils, &s;o to prevent the Breath which comes out of his un|clean Body from blowing upon, and thereby defi|ling the holy Fire. After performance of the&s;e Prayers, the <HI>Daroo</HI> gives the Child Water to drink, and the Rind of a Pomegranate to chew, thereby to clean&s;e it from its inward uncleanne&s;s: Then they wa&s;h his Body with clean Water, and put him on a <HI>Shuddero,</HI> or Cotton Coat, which reaches down to his Ancles, and al&s;o give him a Girdle made of Camels Hair, by them call'd <HI>Cu|&s;hee,</HI> which the Youth mu&s;t never leave off. After all this, the <HI>Daroo</HI> &s;ays this Prayer following:
<Q>God grant that you may be a faithful Maintainer, all your Life, of the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Religion, of which your Habit is a Efficient Badge; and never believe any other Law but that which <HI>Zertoo&s;t</HI> brought with him from Hea|ven. Moreover, that you may always remain con&s;tant in the wor&s;hipping of the Fire, neither eat the Meat of others, nor drink out of their Cups, but undefil'd pre|&s;erve the Ceremonies and Cu&s;toms of the <HI>Per&s;ians.</HI></Q></P>

<P>They have five different kinds of Marriage among them, which have each their proper Name:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Marri|ages.</NOTE> The fir&s;t, call'd <HI>Shau&s;an,</HI> is a Marriage of the Son of one Man to the Daughter of another during their Minority, which the Parents manage among them|&s;elves, without the knowledge of their Children. This &s;ort of Marrying is highly e&s;teem'd among&s;t them, affirming, That tho&s;e who are thus Mar|ry'd &s;hall undoubtedly go directly to Paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;econd &s;ort of Marrying, call'd <HI>Chocker&s;on,</HI> is when a Widow Marries a &s;econd Husband.</P>
<P>The third, nam'd <HI>Codesheraha&s;&s;an,</HI> is when a Woman makes choice of a Man her &s;elf.</P>
<P>The fourth, nam'd <HI>Ect&s;an,</HI> is when a Youth or Maid dies, after having been Betrothed, before the con&s;ummation of the Marriage: for in &s;uch Ca&s;es they have a Cu&s;tom to give another Youth or Maid in Marriage to the Decea&s;ed, becau&s;e they account Marriage to be a great means to make Men happy in the other World. Per&s;ons of Quality commonly Marry after this manner, be|cau&s;e with their Money they purcha&s;e &s;uch as will undertake &s;uch a Marriage as is before men|tioned.</P>
<P>The fifth, nam'd <HI>Ceter&s;on,</HI> is when a Father, having no Sons, but having a Daughter Married who hath Sons, takes one of them to be his real Son, and gives him in Marriage as his own Child; for they e&s;teem a Man mo&s;t mi&s;erable who hath no Children to be&s;tow in Marriage.</P>

After the expiration of the three days, when the Soul hath received her &s;entence, then the Relations make a great Fea&s;t on the fourth day, and &s;o end their Mourning.</P>
<P>One <HI>Twi&s;t</HI> tells us, That they take the Sick from his Bed, and laying him on the Ground, or a Bed of Sand, let him die there; and about thir|ty or forty days after the Burying of the Dead, they carry the &s;aid Bed of Sand, and &s;trew the &s;ame on his Grave. But <HI>Herbert</HI> &s;aith, That they wrap up their deceas'd Bodies in a perfum'd Cloth; and that the Relations which accompa|ny the Corps to the Grave, go beating them|&s;elves, yet with a profound &s;ilence, till they come within fifty or a hundred Paces from the Place of Interment, where the <HI>Herboot</HI> at a le&s;&s;er di&s;tance from the Grave expects them, having a yellow Cloth wrapp'd about his Body, and a little Tul|bant on his Head. The Bearers carry the Corps to a little Hou&s;e built like an Oven, where they perform certain ancient Ceremonies; which done, they draw the Body up to the top of a round Stone Building, of twelve Foot high, and twen|ty four in Circumference, with a double Entrance on the North-Ea&s;t &s;ide, con&s;i&s;ting of two Holes, through which they put the Bodies, <HI>viz.</HI> tho&s;e that have lived well, through the one; and the wicked, through the other.</P>
<P>This Structure is flat on the top, and paved with white Clay, which, when dry, is very hard and &s;mooth, like Pla&s;tering: In the middle there is left an open Hole, into which fall the Bones of the Decea&s;ed, who are laid naked in two Rows on this Structure, in the heat of the Sun, and &s;erve for Food for the Fowls of the Air, which in great numbers coming thither, tear and disfi|gure the Bodies after a horrid manner: And the Air round about this Place is in the heat of Sum|mer &s;o infected with the &s;mell of the corrupted Carca&s;&s;es, which often lie to the number of three or four hundred on the top of the forementioned Place, that it often occa&s;ions great Sickne&s;&s;es e&s;pecially in Strangers.</P>
<P><HI>Twist</HI> affirms, That the&s;e Burying Places are a League or more From the Towns or Villages to which they belong, and being built of Stone, are about three Fathom high, with a Hole in the middle, over which the Decea&s;ed are laid for the Fowls to devour; and their Fle&s;h being con&s;um'd, their Bones fall through an Iron Grate into the foremention'd Hole or Pit.

In each of the&s;e Towers is a Door or Entrance about &s;ix Foot from the Ground, through which they draw the dead Bo|dies up to the top, which are made flat, and &s;o as that the Corps may lie round in three Rows, in Troughs or Che&s;ts of about half a Foot deep.</P>
<P>They account the Bodies of Men to be much more unclean than tho&s;e of Bea&s;ts, and more e&s;pe|cially the Bones of them; for they will by no means touch the Bones of a dead Man or Wo|man: And if any &s;hould chance accidentally to touch them with their Clothes, they are oblig'd immediately to put them off, and all things they have on, and throw them away, as being un|clean; and after having wa&s;h'd their whole Bo|dies, to put on others, and &s;tay within nine days, without driving any Trade, or &s;o much as touch|ing their Wives or Children. Moreover, they account all tho&s;e Per&s;ons damn'd, who&s;e Bones after their decea&s;e happen to fall into the Water, and believe, That the Souls of &s;uch have commit|ted many hainous Sins whil&s;t living upon Earth.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Opinion of the <HI>Benjans</HI> concerning the Creation.</NOTE>God &s;eeing him&s;elf alone, he &s;tudied after what manner he might manife&s;t to others his Splendor and Power; for he fore&s;aw, that his Greatne&s;s and Glory would remain ob&s;cure, and never be known, if he did not communicate them to Mortals. The mo&s;t convenient means there|fore to attain to this his de&s;ire, was to Create the World, and all the Creatures which are in the &s;ame. And in order hereunto, he fir&s;t made the World, beginning with the four Elements, which were to be the Foundation thereof, <HI>viz.</HI> the Earth, Air, Water, and Fire; which in the beginning be|ing mix'd together, were &s;eparated after this man|ner: Fir&s;t he blew on the Water with a large <HI>Sar|batane,</HI> or the like In&s;trument, which thereupon bubling up, came to be a great Body in the form of an Egg, which by degrees extending, became the light and clear &s;hining Firmament of Heaven, which &s;urrounds the whole World. This &s;epa|ration being made, the Earth remained mix'd with a Matter like Sediment of Water, of which God afterwards made a round Ball, and call'd the Lower World, of which the firme&s;t part became Earth, and the other, being the weake&s;t, the Sea; both which making the exact Figure of a Globe, God plac'd the &s;ame in the mid&s;t of the Firmament which &s;urrounds the Sea and Earth.</P>
<P>After this, God Created a Sun and Moon, which he placed in the Firmament, to make a di|&s;tinction of the Times and Sea&s;ons. And by this means the four Elements, which before were con|fu&s;edly mix'd together, were &s;eparated and di|&s;tingui&s;h'd, and each confin'd to its proper place.</P>
<P>The Elements thus &s;etled, each perform'd its Office: The Air fill'd all things that were empty; the Fire by its Heat gave warmth to all; and the
<PB N="225" REF="164">Earth and Sea produc'd their &s;everal Creatures, God giving a generative Power to all to multi|ply and increa&s;e, according to their &s;everal kinds. And thus the great World being perfected, was divided into four Parts, <HI>viz.</HI> Ea&s;t, We&s;t, North, and South. This World was to la&s;t four Ages, and to be inhabited by divers &s;orts of People, which were to be produc'd from four Men and four Women, as we will in&s;tantly relate.</P>
<P>God having thus created the World and the Creatures, he proceeded to create Man, and there|upon commanded the Earth to produce that ex|cellent Creature out of its Bowels: Fir&s;t it put forth the Head, and &s;oon after all the other Parts; into which God breathing Life, the Lips grew red, the Eye-lids open'd, and made two &s;parkling Stars to appear; the other Parts of the Body be|gan to move, and his Sen&s;es with Wi&s;dom, knew their Creator and wor&s;hipp'd him. And becau&s;e this Creature (which was made for Society) &s;hould not be alone, God gave him a Woman for his Companion, which re&s;embled him as well in his Sen&s;e, Rea&s;on, and Spirit. This fir&s;t Creature was call'd <HI>Pourus,</HI> and his Wife <HI>Parkoute;</HI> they liv'd together like Man and Wife, and fed upon the Fruit of the Earth, without killing any living Creature. The&s;e two Per&s;ons living thus toge|ther, begat four Sous; the fir&s;t whereof was call'd <HI>Brammon,</HI> the &s;econd <HI>Kutterey,</HI> the third <HI>Schuddery,</HI> and the fourth <HI>Wy&s;e.</HI> The&s;e four Brothers were of different Con&s;titutions, the four Elements gi|ving to each a different Temper: <HI>Brammon</HI> ha|ving participated of the Earth, was Melancholly; <HI>Kutterey</HI> being hot of Temper, had a Warlike Spi|rit; <HI>Schuddery</HI> being of a cold moi&s;t Con&s;titution, was of a meek Spirit; and <HI>Wy&s;e</HI> being of an angry Di&s;po&s;ition, had a quick Wit.</P>
<P>Moreover, God endu'd <HI>Brammon,</HI> according to his Nature, with Wi&s;dom, and through him pub|li&s;h'd his Laws and Commandments; for he judg'd his re&s;erv'd Life and &s;erious Countenance mo&s;t fit for that purpo&s;e: and therefore he gave him a Book, wherein was &s;et down how he would be &s;erv'd; and which al&s;o treated of other things con|cerning Religion.</P>
<P>God al&s;o, according to the Con&s;titution of <HI>Kut|terey,</HI> gave him Power to rule Kingdoms, with a Scepter to keep the People in awe, and make the Commonalty work and labor for the Publick Good: And as a &s;ign of this Power, God gave him a Sword in his Hand, the proper In&s;trument of his Victory and Dominion.</P>
<P><HI>Schuddery,</HI> according to his natural Inclinations, God judg'd fit for Traffick, whereby he might fur|ni&s;h all parts of the Earth with &s;uch things as they &s;tood in need of, by means of Navigation: and as a Token of what he was appointed for, as al&s;o to mind him of his Employment, God gave him a pair of Scales, with a Bag full of all &s;orts of Weights, as proper In&s;truments of his Calling.</P>
<P><HI>Wy&s;e,</HI> according to his Di&s;po&s;ition, God endu'd with a Genius of inventing all manner of Mecha|nical Arts, giving him a Bag full of Tools and In|&s;truments, for the working of &s;uch things withal as his Fancy &s;hould direct.</P>
<P>The World being thus far compleated, God gave not <HI>Pourous</HI> and <HI>Parkoutee</HI> any Daughters, le&s;t Works, which hitherto he had pre&s;erv'd from all Uncleanne&s;s, might be defil'd by the ince&s;tuous Conjunction of the Brothers with the Si&s;ters; wherefore God being willing to pre&s;erve the In|nocence and Holine&s;s of their fir&s;t Parents, re&s;|olv'd to ordain &s;uch means for the propagating. Mankind, as might corre&s;pond with the Work of the Creation, by making four Women for the Sons of <HI>Pourous</HI> an&s;t <HI>Parkoutee;</HI> whereof one was &s;ent to the Ea&s;t, another to the We&s;t, a third to the North, and a fourth to the South, that being thus &s;eparated one from the other, the Propagation of Man kind might be the &s;ooner compleated in all Parts of the Earth.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t Son of the fir&s;t Man call'd <HI>Brammon,</HI> became Great, being highly e&s;teem'd by his other Brothers, as well for his Age as his great Merits, but e&s;pecially for the Conver&s;e he often held with God, concerning Religion and the manner of Wor&s;hip; wherein he in&s;tructed his Brethren, reading the Book which was given him by God, containing the Secrets and Manner of wor&s;hip|ping him, with great Care and Reverence, God revealing him&s;elf to him very often in Per&s;on.</P>
<P>And as God had created Man in a plea&s;ant and delightful Place, &s;ituate in the Belly and Navel of the Earth, where the Sun makes no Shadow at Noon, &s;o he re&s;olv'd to &s;end the Brothers which were come from the Centre of the World, to the Circumference thereof, to People it. Wherefore he commanded <HI>Brammon</HI> to take the Book wherein were written the Laws of God, and travel towards the ri&s;ing of the Sun; who thereupon &s;etting for|ward the next Morning, after having travell'd &s;e|veral Miles, found him&s;elf near an high Mountain inclo&s;ing a plea&s;ant Valley, which was water'd by a delightful Stream; on who&s;e Banks appear'd a beautiful Woman, who came to quench her Thir&s;t with the Waters; &s;he, like <HI>Brammon,</HI> was &s;tark na|ked, which their Innocency made them ignorant of.

Thus Travelling towards the We&s;t, he continual|ly look'd about him, expecting &s;ome Adventure would pre&s;ent it &s;elf, and wi&s;hing to meet with whole Regiments of Armed Men, or Herds of Wild Bea&s;ts; when nothing appearing, and con|&s;idering on what account God &s;ent him thither, full of Heroick Pa&s;&s;ion, he could not refrain thus to expo&s;tulate: <HI>For what rea&s;on has God given me Strength, &s;ince he denies me an Opportunity to mani|fe&s;t the &s;ame, and acquire Honor thereby!</HI> Howbe|it he Travell'd yet farther We&s;tward, in hopes of meeting an Adventure befitting his Quality, and re&s;olving to expo&s;e whatever he &s;hould meet, to the Fury of his Rage: When coming to a Moun|tain who&s;e Summit yielded a delightful Pro&s;pect over all the adjacent Country, he perceiv'd a well|&s;hap'd Creature make towards him, of a Di&s;po&s;i|tion and Countenance &s;utable to his, wherewith he was exceedingly pleas'd; when coming neer together, with an intention of trying each others Valor, he perceiv'd it was a Woman; her Hair di&s;hevell'd hung dangling over her Shoulders, holding in her Hands a <HI>Chucherey,</HI> which being a round &s;harp Weapon, hath a Hole in the middle, through which pa&s;&s;es a Rope, who&s;e end being held fa&s;t in the Hand, does great Execution at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, when thrown at an Enemy: Which he perceiving, immediately believ'd her Valiant; for her enrag'd Countenance was a &s;uf|ficient Te&s;timony of the earne&s;t de&s;ire &s;he had to Conquer and Triumph over her Enemies. After their fir&s;t A&s;&s;ault, <HI>Toddika&s;tre</HI> (&s;o the Woman was call'd) u&s;ing her <HI>Chucherey</HI> with great dexterity, &s;oon made <HI>Kuttery</HI> &s;en&s;ible of her high di&s;plea&s;ure, manife&s;ting a greater de&s;ire of conquering him with her Arms than with her Beauty; whereby this fir&s;t day of their Meeting was &s;pent in Blows and Wounds interchangeably given; &s;he with her <HI>Chuchery,</HI> and he with his Sword, &s;carce allowing each other re&s;pite to breathe, continuing the Com|bate till the dark Night's approach forc'd a Ce&s;|&s;ation, when neither could boa&s;t of any Advan|tage gain'd upon the other.</P>
<P>The next Morning, &s;o &s;oon as the Sun began to dart out his Re&s;plendent Rays, they renew'd their Combat with fre&s;h Courage and Eagerne&s;s, re|&s;olving to revenge the Injuries they had receiv'd the day before: Long was the Fight, and doubt|ful, when <HI>Kuttery</HI> getting &s;ome Advantage, cut her <HI>Chuchery</HI> a&s;under with his Sword; but it growing dark, <HI>Toddika&s;tre</HI> vani&s;h'd from <HI>Kuttery,</HI> thereby gaining time to &s;upply her &s;elf with a Bow and Arrows, and gather new Force to engage an Ene|my that had endeavor'd to kill her.</P>
<P>The third Morning they renew'd the Fight again, entertaining alike hopes of ending the Bat|tel &s;peedily, and &s;ubduing each other; when &s;he ob&s;erving her Enemy within reach of her Bow, approach'd with great Courage: Which <HI>Kuttery</HI> perceiving, and knowing his Sword would &s;ignifie little again&s;t a VVeapon that could command at &s;o great a di&s;tance, re&s;olv'd to engage her Hand to Hand; when each of them gave &s;uch ample Te|&s;timonies of their Valor, and &s;o wearied them|&s;elves, that they remain'd equally Conquerors and Conquer'd. Thus the Fight having been maintain'd on equal Terms, and the Advantage not determinable, they di&s;puted the Victory with their Tongues, &s;ince it could not be decided by their VVeapons: For <HI>Kuttery</HI> holding <HI>Toddika&s;tre</HI> by the Hair, and endeavoring to make her &s;ubmit, was extremely &s;truck with admiration when &s;he appear'd to him much more Beautiful than before, as if this Exerci&s;e had &s;erv'd only to encrea&s;e her Beauty, and render her more amiable; which ob|lig'd him to direct the following Di&s;cour&s;e to her.</P>
<P><HI>Wherefore, O Wonder of all Living Creatures, as well for Valor as Beauty, has Fury and Rage thus tran&s;ported us one again&s;t the other? If I had be|reav'd you of Life in this Conflict, I &s;hould have curs'd my Right Hand for being the In&s;trument of de|&s;troying &s;o Incomparable a Creature; whereas if you had kill'd me, you could not but have been perpetually troubled in Mind, having bereft your &s;elf of the Plea&s;ures, Enjoyments, and Satisfaction you may po&s;|&s;ibly have in my Company: Why then &s;hould a Per&s;on of &s;uch Excellency &s;eek the Ruin of another, which ob|tain'd, would not in the lea&s;t add to your Lu&s;tre. Hath God given us Under&s;tanding and Courage to de&s;troy one another, e&s;pecially we that ought to be pre&s;erv'd? Certainly your Valor will not be abated, when I &s;hall declare unto you my Condition, and divide my Strength and Power with you; nay rather, being Friends, we &s;hall be capacitated for the Undertaking the greate&s;t Enterprizes what&s;oever, and valiantly revenge all In|juries that &s;hall be offer'd us. Know then, That the World is yet but like a young Child, having far great|er need of being repleni&s;h'd with People, than bereft of them by force of Arms. Love and Nature teach us to &s;tudy our own Pre&s;ervation, which may better be accompli&s;h'd by being at Union, than at Variance one with another. Let us not therefore endeavor by force|able and unlawful Means to &s;eek a Glory which may prove Mortal to both; but let us rather &s;tudy to &s;ettle a happy and everla&s;ting Peace between us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Toddika&s;tre</HI> having with great attention heark|ned unto a Propo&s;al grounded on &s;o much Rea&s;on, after a little &s;ilence reply'd, <HI>That notwith&s;tanding &s;he plainly di&s;cover'd &s;ufficient marks of his Rage and Fury, which might provoke her to Revenge, yet &s;he &s;ubmitted to his Argument, readily and freely con|&s;enting to his Propo&s;al of Peace.</HI> VVhereupon gi|ving each other their Hands, to confirm their new Friend&s;hip, they, of mortal Enemies, became the greate&s;t Friends in Nature; and re&s;olving to live and die together, begat many Children, pro|ducing a Race of Valiant and Heroick Spirits: And thus was the VVe&s;tern Part of the World Peopled by the&s;e two Generous Enemies.</P>
<P><HI>Shuddery</HI> the third Son of <HI>Pourous</HI> was &s;ent Northward to Traffique as a Merchant, taking with him his Weights and a Pair of Scales, wherewith to weigh whatever was bought or &s;old. Having travell'd a con&s;iderable way, wi&s;hing to meet with an Adventure &s;utable to his Calling, he came at la&s;t to a Mountain call'd <HI>Challa,</HI> when be|ginning to Rain very hard, he was nece&s;&s;itated to
<PB N="227" REF="165">&s;eek for &s;helter in a &s;mall Cave which was in the &s;aid Mountain. The Rain cea&s;ing, the Sky be|gan to clear up; but the Water having cover'd mo&s;t of the Ways, kept <HI>Shuddery</HI> from Travelling that day: But no &s;ooner had the thir&s;ty Earth drunk up the Water, and the Sun dry'd up the re|maining Moi&s;ture, when in order to proceed on his Journey he leaves the Cave, and &s;carcely ar|riv'd at the bottom of the Valley, but he found &s;e|veral Shells, which out of Curio&s;ity opening, he concluded by their Brightne&s;s and Beauty that they ought carefully to be pre&s;erv'd, though alto|gether ignorant of the Value; &s;o putting them up very &s;afe, he went on, and having &s;carce pa&s;s'd through the Valley, he found him&s;elf near ano|ther Mountain, upon which appear'd a Rock of Diamonds, wich having been wa&s;h'd by the great Rain, appear'd very glorious and &s;parkling, cau|&s;ing a great admiration in <HI>Shuddery,</HI> who judg'd it to have been a great Fire. Pa&s;&s;ing on, and per|ceiving the &s;uppos'd Fire did not &s;pread it &s;elf, yet encreas'd in Lu&s;tre, he was curious to be &s;atisfied what it might be, by touching the &s;ame with his Finger, whereby he perceiv'd that though the&s;e glittering Diamonds &s;parkled like Fire, yet they had not that Heat with them; wherefore he re|&s;olv'd to expect the next Morning, to &s;ee if he could make any further Di&s;covery of this great My&s;tery: But the Day caus'd a far greater altera|tion than he expected, which no &s;ooner appear'd, but the Light of the Diamonds vani&s;h'd, nothing remaining but a Rock of whiti&s;h Stones, of which he took as many as he could carry, carefully ob|&s;erving the Place again&s;t his Return, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be better inform'd of the Value. Whence proceeding, he at la&s;t e&s;py'd the Nymph that was ordain'd for him, walking by the &s;ide of the Wood which border'd on the Plain he was cro&s;&s;ing: He directed his Cour&s;e towards the Object which at that di&s;tance appear'd to him mo&s;t plea&s;ing and beautiful. The Nymph was not a little &s;urpris'd at the &s;ight of him, remaining in &s;u&s;pence whe|ther to fly or &s;tay, till <HI>Shuddery</HI> approaching near her, thus expre&s;s'd him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Mo&s;t admirable and beautiful Creature, &s;o nearly re&s;embling me, I beg your Company, not onely for the likene&s;s between us, to our mutual admiration, which I hope may oblige you to love me, and entertain a good Opinion of one that follows you with no bad Intent; but that I may be happy in your Conver&s;ation, &s;ince the Similitude between us &s;eems to challenge a more inti|mate Familiarity. Vi&s;agondah</HI> (for &s;uch was her Name) expre&s;s'd by her &s;ilence the plea&s;ure &s;he took in <HI>Shuddery</HI>'s Pre&s;ence, no way di&s;tru&s;ting her Safety; at la&s;t &s;he demanded of him <HI>how it came to pa&s;s that two Per&s;ons, having never &s;een one another before, could &s;o perfectly under&s;tand each others Lan|guage.</HI> To which <HI>Shuddery</HI> reply'd, <HI>That God who had given their Bodies a like Shape, had al&s;o endued them with one Tongue, thereby to a&s;&s;i&s;t and di&s;cover their Secrets one to another.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus &s;hew'd great Te&s;timonies of Friend&s;hip to one another, &s;taying &s;ome time in the Place, <HI>Shuddery</HI> related to her his Adven|tures; after which, living many Years together, they begat divers Children, which grown up be|came Merchants, with whom <HI>Shuddery</HI> work'd in the Diamond-Rock he had di&s;cover'd, laying up great Quantities thereof, and prizing them at a high Value, made them &s;o e&s;teem'd of through the whole World. And from the I&s;&s;ue of this <HI>Shuddery</HI> (according to the Tradition of the <HI>Indians</HI>) the Northern Parts of the World were Peopled.</P>
<P><HI>Wy&s;e,</HI> the younge&s;t of the four Brothers, took his Journey towards the South, taking with him the mo&s;t u&s;eful In&s;truments which he had invent|ed for the Benefit of Mankind; for God had en|du'd him with far more Under&s;tanding than any of his Brothers: He was the Inventor of all Arts, and taught his Children to Build Hou&s;es, Towns, and Ca&s;tles, to Till the Groud, and all other things nece&s;&s;ary to Humane Life; for which rea|&s;on he was call'd <HI>Viskarmah,</HI> that is, <HI>A Vertuo&s;o,</HI> becau&s;e nothing was difficult to him that could be done.</P>
<P>Being endu'd with this great Knowledge and Skill in Husbandry and Building, God order'd him to Travel Southward, where in his way he pa&s;s'd by &s;even great Lakes, leaving at each of them Marks of his Ingenuity; and having pa&s;s'd the la&s;t, he found him&s;elf in a Country call'd <HI>Derpe,</HI> where he built a fair Hou&s;e near the Lake, with many Apartments, and a flat Roof. Here he &s;taid &s;ome time alone to refre&s;h him&s;elf; but he had not long enjoy'd the &s;weetne&s;s of his Re|po&s;e, when he was di&s;turb'd by a &s;trange Acci|dent: The Woman which was appointed for him, pa&s;&s;ing by a neighboring Wood near the &s;ide of the Lake, &s;tood &s;till to admire the Magnificent Form of the new-built Structure, which &s;he ap|proach'd to view more narrowly, having never be|fore &s;een the like.</P>
<P><HI>Wy&s;e</HI> e&s;pying her &s;o earne&s;tly view his Habita|tion, found him&s;elf &s;truck with admiration at the &s;ight of &s;o &s;urpri&s;ing a Creature, her Body being perfectly White, and her Hair re&s;embling the Colour of Gold; wherefore he approach'd nearer the Per&s;on who at a di&s;tance had wrought a very great alteration in him: whil&s;t &s;he was not a little aba&s;h'd to &s;ee him come &s;o near her, and ask'd the Rea&s;on of his coming to di&s;turb her in a Place where &s;he us'd always to be alone. Whereupon <HI>Wy&s;e</HI> replying, &s;aid, <HI>God the Maker of Light, who hath created all things vi&s;ible, hath &s;ent me hither to behold and admire your Beauty, which is &s;o excellent, that it ought not to be kept &s;ecret; for God hath crea|ted you to be &s;een, and to te&s;tifie the wondrous Works of his Hands. And to enjoy your pre&s;ence I have tra|vell'd through many Dangers, often adventuring my Life in the &s;earch of you; and therefore I hope my Love will meet with a &s;utable Return.</HI> La&s;tly, <HI>he de|&s;ir'd her to afford him the enjoyment of her Company, and to look upon him as the onely Comfort &s;ent by God in her &s;olitary Life.</HI> But &s;he re&s;olving not to change her manner of Life, reply'd, <HI>That during his Ab&s;ence &s;he could no way perceive that his Pre&s;ence could be any Advantage to her; nor at that in&s;tant, whil&s;t he was talking with her, &s;he could not find her &s;elf any ways inclined to receive his Proffers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wy&s;e</HI> fearing to lo&s;e her Pre&s;ence, being de&s;irous of a longer enjoyment of her Company, reque&s;ted her to walk into his Hou&s;e, and to view the &s;eve|ral Apartments thereof, hoping when &s;he had &s;een the wonderful Work of his Hands, &s;he would have a greater Re&s;pect for him: But his Civility &s;eem'd rather trouble&s;om to her, telling him, <HI>That if he would not let her depart freely, he would highly incur her di&s;plea&s;ure, and force her to vow never to &s;ee him more.</HI> Whereupon going from him, &s;he gave him &s;ufficient Te&s;timonies of her Di&s;plea&s;ure, and that &s;he was not to be compell'd to do any thing by force. This reduc'd <HI>Wy&s;e</HI> almo&s;t into De&s;pair, who dur&s;t not by any means prevent her going away, but was compell'd to &s;uffer him&s;elf to be
<PB N="228" REF="166">bereav'd of all tho&s;e Enjoyments he was po&s;&s;e&s;t of during her &s;tay; and having &s;pent the follow|ing Night in condoling his Misfortune in the lo&s;s of the Per&s;on he e&s;teem'd above his own Life, he at break of day concluded to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible dili|gence to find her again; and cro&s;&s;ing the neighbor Places backward and forward, he at la&s;t came into a Valley, where he &s;py'd her picking of Flowers, and acco&s;ting her, began as follows.</P>
<P><HI>O mo&s;t Beautiful Creature, much more &s;weet and excellent than all the Flowers this Earth produces, the Love which I bear to you forces me a &s;econd time to view your mo&s;t incomparable Beauty, and to implore a Return of your Affections. Oh fly not, &s;ince you have have had &s;ufficient Te&s;timonies of the reality of my Af|fections.</HI> He &s;eeing that the&s;e words had pre|vail'd with her to &s;tay, began to di&s;cour&s;e with her concerning the Creation of the World, and in|form her of what Parents he was extracted, and after what manner his Brothers were &s;ent into &s;e|veral Parts of the Earth: And after many other remarkable Pa&s;&s;ages, he told her, he could not be|lieve that God would have permitted him to Tra|vel over &s;even Seas, and undergo &s;o many Dan|gers, had not his Re&s;olutions been to &s;weeten the toil&s;omne&s;s of his Lahors and Troubles by the hap|py Enjoyment of her Company. She not de|lighting in his Di&s;cour&s;e, de&s;ir'd him to entertain &s;ome other things in his Thoughts; and if he could give her no greater Te&s;timonies of his Affe|ction, to leave her alone, and not trouble her more with any &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;e: And &s;o they parted.</P>
<P><HI>Wy&s;e</HI> thus depriv'd of all his Enjoyments and Happine&s;s, being extremely perplex'd in Mind, went into a &s;olitary Place, where falling down on his Knees, in a doleful Tone he utter'd the&s;e words.</P>
<P><HI>O Lord, to whom only belongs the Knowledge of my Being, thou know&s;t that in obedience to thy Commands I have for&s;aken the Company of my Parents, and al&s;o that of my Brothers, and perhaps I &s;hall never &s;ee them more: Thou al&s;o knowe&s;t that I have endur'd great hard&s;hip during the time of my Travels, and de&s;erted all Company, to range up and down the World alone: But that which mo&s;t perplexes me, is the &s;ight of a Per|&s;on, who, in &s;tead of comforting me with her Pre&s;ence and Conver&s;ation, adds to my Grief, by denying me her Company. O Lord, do not reward all my Troubles &s;o ill, and de&s;troy not all tho&s;e good Parts thou ha&s;t given me, by this great Misfortune. And you blue Heavens, and green Trees, under which I kneel, be Witne&s;&s;es of my Misfortune; and therefore, O thou Creator of all things, if thou ha&s;t the lea&s;t kindne&s;s for thy Creature, give me, I be&s;eech thee, a &s;ign there|of, by comforting me in this un&s;ufferable Affliction under which thy Servant groans.</HI></P>
<P>No &s;ooner had he ended his Prayers, but a &s;weet Brieze of Wind came ru&s;hing through the Leaves of the Trees, which was follow'd by a Voice, &s;aying, <HI>What are thy Demands, O Son of Pourous?</HI> To which he an&s;wer'd, <HI>That I may enjoy the Woman who&s;e Face I &s;o lately beheld, and that we may be united by the in&s;eparable Bond of Matrimony, that &s;o I may enjoy the &s;weetne&s;s of her Company till the Hour of my Death.</HI> This was immediately granted him, upon condition that he &s;hould build <HI>Pagods</HI> or Temples under the Shades of Trees, there to &s;erve God, and wor&s;hip the Images, be|cau&s;e God had heard his Prayer. Immediately after <HI>Jejunogundah</HI> (for &s;o the Woman was call'd) finding her &s;elf inclin'd to love <HI>Wy&s;e,</HI> went and gave him Te&s;timony of her Affections, granting him all his Wi&s;hes; &s;o that from that time for|ward living quiet in the mutual Enjoyment of each other, they begat many Children: By which means the Southern, as well as the other Parts of he World, came to be Peopled.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, The&s;e four Brethren, after having thus Peopled the World, re&s;olv'd to return again to the Place where they fir&s;t receiv'd Life. <HI>Bram|mon</HI> was the fir&s;t who with his Extract, after ha|ving Planted the Ea&s;t, re&s;olv'd to go and end the remaining part of his Days in the Place where he was born, and there to in&s;truct his People in the true Wor&s;hip of God, to the end there might be onely one way of Serving God throughout the whole VVorld, which otherwi&s;e might breed a great di&s;traction among the People.</P>
<P><HI>Kuttery,</HI> who was the &s;econd Brother, and the fir&s;t who had compleated his Journey after <HI>Bram|mon,</HI> and perform'd all things he was de&s;ign'd for, had al&s;o an Inclination to &s;ee his Native Country, to acquaint his Parents and Brothers with the Ble&s;&s;ing that God had be&s;tow'd upon him, in a VVife and &s;o many Children; and al&s;o to relate to them the Adventures he had met withal during his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Rea&s;ons mov'd <HI>Shuddery</HI> and <HI>Wy&s;e</HI> to Travel to their Native Country. Moreover, God, who would not fru&s;trate their De&s;igns by any ill Accidents that otherwi&s;e might have hap|ned, &s;uffer'd them all &s;afely to meet at one Place, after every one of them had perform'd tho&s;e Offi|ces which were enjoyn'd them, to the great Sati&s;|faction and Joy of their Parents and them&s;elves; and began, like Men remov'd to a new Plantation, to propagate their Generations at home al&s;o, to the end the World might be fully Peopled in all Parts, &s;pending their time in teaching their Peo|ple &s;everal Arts. <HI>Brammon</HI> in&s;tructed them in Religion, <HI>Kuttery</HI> in Matters of State, <HI>Shuddery</HI> in Merchandi&s;e, and <HI>Wy&s;e</HI> in Mechanicks: So that at this time the VVorld con&s;i&s;ted of the&s;e four &s;orts of People, each Tribe living apart, accord|ing to their Office, for avoiding all Confu&s;ions and Di&s;orders: And thus the VVorld was Plant|ed in each Part, and all thing were for a time in good Order. But their Joy did not long continue, they having no &s;ooner ta&s;ted the &s;weetne&s;s of it, than it vani&s;h'd; for as <HI>Multitude is the Mother of Confu&s;ion,</HI> and occa&s;ions much Mi&s;chief, and many Evils happen where the People are numer|ous and carele&s;s, and Negligence reigns chiefly in pro&s;perous Times; &s;o by the Sen&s;uality of the&s;e four Brethren forgetting all thoughts of their pre&s;ent and former Happine&s;s, all things began to run into mi&s;erable Confu&s;ion, becau&s;e the People were too much enclin'd to Voluptuou&s;|ne&s;s and Ea&s;e; <HI>Brammon</HI> neglecting his Duty and Religion, and Service of God: <HI>Kuttery</HI> became a Tyrant: <HI>Shuddery</HI> fal&s;ified his VVeights and Ba|lance, and practis'd all manner of Knavery to de|fraud his Brothers: <HI>Wy&s;e</HI> grew uncon&s;cionable, employing the Benefits which aro&s;e from his In|ventions in Profu&s;ene&s;s. Thus each of them de|rogating from their fir&s;t Principles, grew malici|ous to each other; <HI>Brammon</HI> not being able to di|&s;pen&s;e with the In&s;olence of his Brother <HI>Kuttery,</HI> who on the other &s;ide refus'd to &s;hew Reverence to <HI>Brammon,</HI> which he was oblig'd to, as being his elder Brother; moreover, he was very cruel, and took delght in putting to death tho&s;e he di&s;|lik'd, forc'd <HI>Shuddery</HI> to pay Tribute to him, and reap'd the benefit of <HI>Wy&s;e</HI>'s Lahor.

<P><HI>Wy&s;e</HI> &s;eeing <HI>Brammon</HI> love his Credit and Re|&s;pect which was due to him, concluded to make him yet more mi&s;erable, by in&s;tituting a new man|ner of Religion in the World, <HI>viz.</HI> The Wor|&s;hipping or Images, which he was commanded by a Vi&s;ion; hereupon he built <HI>Pagods</HI> under the Shades of Trees, ordaining many new Ceremo|nies: But becau&s;e there was no mention made of them in the Books of <HI>Brammon,</HI> great Di&s;putes were held for a long time to know whether they &s;hould be receiv'd or not; but after <HI>Wy&s;e</HI> had con|firm'd that he had receiv'd them from the Mouth of God, they were adjudg'd Lawful.

<P>In this manner, according to the Opinion of the <HI>Benjans,</HI> ended the fir&s;t Age of the World; and they further add, That God &s;hew'd his Power in de&s;troying the Creatures he had made, which perhaps el&s;e would never have been known; yet he Created a new World and People, which were all Clean, and de&s;erving of his Wi&s;dom and Mercy: And becau&s;e the fir&s;t Age of the World was thus de&s;troy'd by the wickedne&s;s of the Peo|ple, he re&s;olv'd by means of three more perfect Per&s;ons than the fir&s;t, call'd <HI>Bremaw, Wi&s;tney,</HI> and <HI>Rudderey,</HI> to make a &s;econd; and in order there|unto, God leaving the Heavens, de&s;cended upon a great Mountain call'd <HI>Meropurbattee,</HI> from the top of which he utter'd the&s;e words; <HI>Ri&s;e up</HI> Bremaw, <HI>the fir&s;t of Living Creatures of the &s;econd Age:</HI> Whereupon the Earth opening, <HI>Bremaw</HI> &s;tarted up out of the Bowels thereof, and at the &s;ame in&s;tant knew his Creator, and Wor&s;hipp'd him: after which, God by a &s;econd and third Command caus'd <HI>Wi&s;tney</HI> and <HI>Rudderey</HI> al&s;o to ari&s;e and wor|&s;hip him. But as God does nothing without &s;eri|ous Con&s;ideration, and appoints all things to a certain end, &s;o likewi&s;e he did not create the&s;e three Per&s;ons to live alone in Idlene&s;s, but to re|people the World, and gave to <HI>Bremaw,</HI> who was the fir&s;t, the Power of making new Creatures; for (&s;ay the <HI>Benjans</HI>) as Princes do not Officiate their Affairs but by Agents, &s;o did it not &s;tand with God's Greatne&s;s to humble him&s;elf to make his own Creatures, as long as he was able to do it by means of his Servants.</P>
<P>To <HI>Wi&s;tney,</HI> who was the &s;econd, he gave the Charge of taking Care to pre&s;erve tho&s;e Crea|tures which as he had commanded through his Mercy to be made, &s;o it did likewi&s;e be&s;eem his Wi&s;dom to &s;ee them pre&s;erv'd: Yet to <HI>Rudderey,</HI> who was the third, he give Power to de&s;troy them; for he fore&s;aw that they would grow wic|ked, and de&s;erving of Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>And as God had given the Power to the&s;e three Per&s;ons to make &s;uch wonderful Creatures, he was al&s;o oblig'd to give them a means whereby they might be able to perform their &s;everal Offices. <HI>Bremaw</HI> therefore had the Power to Create and Produce &s;uch Creatures as he thought mo&s;t fit: And to the end <HI>Wi&s;tney</HI> might be able to pre&s;erve them, God gave him a full Power over all things which might tend to their Pre&s;ervation, making him Lord of the Sun and Moon, Clouds, Rain, and the Dew which falls on the Earth, as al&s;o of Hills and Valleys, leaving it to his di&s;cretion to appoint the &s;everal Sea&s;ons of the Year, and gi|ving him Power of be&s;towing Riches, Health, and Honor on whom he pleas'd; in a word, he made him Ma&s;ter of all things which tend to the wel|fare and &s;upport of Humane Creatures. And to the end <HI>Ruddery</HI> might be the onely In&s;trument to execute God's Ju&s;tice, God gave him Power over all things which might occa&s;ion the Ruin of Li|ving Creatures, giving him Power to cha&s;tize Sinners with Sickne&s;s, Poverty, War, Pe&s;tilence, and Death.</P>
<P>After their &s;everal Offices were pre&s;crib'd to the&s;e three Per&s;ons, a certain time was limited them to live upon the Earth: And becau&s;e the Work of the Creation, which belong'd to <HI>Bre|maw,</HI> was perfected in the &s;econd Age, he de&s;er|vedly at the end thereof was taken up into Hea|ven, to dwell with the Almighty. Furthermore, &s;ince the other Age was to be Peopled by tho&s;e which were pre&s;erv'd from the General De&s;tructi|on of the World, <HI>Wi&s;tney</HI> &s;taid twice as long on the Earth as his Brother <HI>Bremaw,</HI> becau&s;e there was a longer time requir'd for their farther Pre&s;er|vation. And becau&s;e the World was to be ended by a general Ruin and De&s;truction, therefore <HI>Rud|dery</HI> was to &s;tay three times longer on the Earth than <HI>Wi&s;tney,</HI> to the end that when the great day of Judgement &s;hould come, he &s;hould de&s;troy all Creatures, and carry their Souls with him into a Place of Glory.</P>
<P>Moreover, when they had all things granted them, wanting nothing but to put in execution tho&s;e Commandments which God had laid upon them, <HI>Bremaw</HI> began &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider with him&s;elf after what manner he might behave him|&s;elf mo&s;t honourably in the Employment that God had put him upon; when on a &s;udden he felt a &s;trange alteration in his Body, accompanied with a general Pain through all his Parts, &s;uch as that with a Woman in her Travel, foretelling &s;ome &s;trange and wonderful Event; his Body was in an in&s;tant &s;well'd after a &s;trange manner, and his Intrails grew &s;en&s;ibly bigger than before: At la&s;t his Body open'd in two Places, <HI>viz.</HI> on his Right and Left Side, out of which came two Twins, the one a Male, the other a Female, both of their full growth.</P>
<P><HI>Bremaw</HI> having receiv'd Strength again, in&s;tru|cted them in things concerning Religion, and call'd the Man <HI>Manow,</HI> and the Woman <HI>Ceteroupa,</HI> who after they had wor&s;hipp'd God, thank'd <HI>Bre|maw</HI> that brought them into the VVorld; and ha|ving receiv'd his Ble&s;&s;ing; they travell'd towards the Ea&s;t, &s;etling on a Mountain call'd <HI>Munderpur|vool,</HI> to the end that tho&s;e which they &s;hould be|get might &s;pread them&s;elves Ea&s;t, We&s;t, North, and South. No &s;ooner were they come to the foremention'd Mountain, but <HI>Ceteroupa</HI> was deli|ver'd of three Sons and three Daughters, whereof the elde&s;t Son was call'd <HI>Priauretta,</HI> the &s;econd
<PB N="230" REF="167"><HI>Outanapautha,</HI> the third <HI>Scomeraut;</HI> the elde&s;t Daughter was nam'd <HI>Kammah,</HI> the &s;econd <HI>Soone|retaw,</HI> and the third <HI>Sumboo.</HI> As &s;oon as they came to Age, they were &s;ent to &s;everal Places, <HI>Priauretta</HI> and <HI>Kammah</HI> to the We&s;t, to a Moun|tain call'd <HI>Segund; Otanapautha</HI> and <HI>Soonurettaw</HI> to the North, to the Mountain <HI>Ripola; Someraut</HI> and <HI>Sumboo</HI> to the South, to the Mountain <HI>Supars;</HI> all which Countries they made very populous. By this means <HI>Bremaw</HI> was the fir&s;t Father of all the Inhabitants of the Earth, whil&s;t <HI>Wi&s;tney</HI> took care for all nece&s;&s;ary things for the pre&s;ervation of hu|mane Creatures which <HI>Bremaw</HI> had made, by af|fording them all the Ble&s;&s;ings that make Men hap|py in this Life, till at la&s;t <HI>Ruddery</HI> &s;ent Sickne&s;s, Death, and a Cur&s;e among the Children of Men, who by their wicked Lives had ju&s;tly merited God's Vengeance.</P>
<P>This was the manner of Government which God us'd for the re&s;toring of the World, and all humane Creatures which were to inhabit in the &s;econd Age.</P>
<P>Furthermore, God (according to the Relation of the <HI>Benjans</HI>) taught Men to &s;erve him after this manner.</P>
<P>When God &s;aw that there could be no Order nor lawful Government in tho&s;e Places where his Wor&s;hip and Service was not E&s;tabli&s;h'd, he re&s;olv'd to make Laws for the preventing of Man's committing tho&s;e Crimes which were the de&s;truction of the fir&s;t Age: In order whereunto he de&s;cended upon the Mountain <HI>Meropurbatee;</HI> to which Place he call'd <HI>Bremaw,</HI> to whom he ap|pear'd in his Glory through a dark and thick Cloud, telling him, <Q>That he was nece&s;&s;itated to de&s;troy the fir&s;t Age, by rea&s;on Men would not obey his Commands, which were contain'd in the Book he had given to <HI>Brammon.</HI></Q> At the &s;ame time God gave <HI>Bremaw</HI> another Book, and commanded him to teach all things that were con|tain'd therein. <HI>Bremaw</HI> to Execute his Office, pub|li&s;h'd God's Commandments to all People on the Earth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Benjans</HI> call this Book <HI>Sha&s;ter,</HI> that is, <HI>The Book of Written Words,</HI> which contains three Trea|ti&s;es or Parts; the fir&s;t whereof contains their Fundamental Laws, with an Explanation of each Commandment. The &s;econd treats of the Cere|monial Law, and teaches them the Ceremonies which are to be ob&s;erv'd in their Religion. The third Treati&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hes all Men into certain Families or Tribes, and comprehends the Com|mandments of each Tribe in particular, which is all that is contain'd in the Book <HI>Sha&s;ter;</HI> out of which we will here &s;et down the chief Heads thereof. The fir&s;t Treati&s;e, in which is de&s;crib'd the Fundamental Laws which <HI>Bremaw</HI> taught, contain'd the following eight.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Thou &s;halt not kill any Creature that hath Life in it, for thou art one of the Creatures, and &s;o is that; thou art endu'd with a Soul as that is, therefore thou &s;halt not take away the Life of any thing what&s;oever it be, which belongs to me.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Thou &s;halt make a Contract with the five Sen&s;es; Fir&s;t with thy Eyes, that they may not &s;ee any thing that is ill. Secondly, with your Ears, that they may not hearken to any bad thing. Thirdly, with your Tongue. not to expre&s;s any ill words. Fourthly, with your Pallat, that you ta&s;te nothing unclean, as Wine or the Fle&s;h of living Creatures. La&s;tly, with your Hands, that they may not touch any thing to defile them.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>Thou &s;halt exactly ob&s;erve and keep all the Days and Times appointed for Devotion, as likewi&s;e Clean|&s;ing, with Wor&s;hipping and Praying, which thou mu&s;t perform with an upright and zealous Heart.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>Thou &s;halt not give any fal&s;e Te&s;timonies, or &s;peak Lies, by means of which thou mighte&s;t defraud thy Brother, and enrich thy &s;elf by fraudulent means, when thou Trade&s;t with him.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. <HI>Thou &s;halt be merciful to the Poor according to thy Power, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their Nece&s;&s;ities with Meat, Wood, and other things they may &s;tand in need of for their &s;upport.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>6. <HI>Thou &s;halt not oppre&s;s the Poor, and &s;erve thy &s;elf with that Power which is given thee, to de&s;troy thy Brother unju&s;tly.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>7. <HI>Thou &s;halt keep certain Fea&s;ts and Holidays with|out pampering thy Body, and feeding thy &s;elf with La|civiou&s;ne&s;s, but on the contrary, &s;pend certain Days in Fasting; and in &s;tead of Sleeping over much, Watch often, to be the better prepar'd for Praying, and for the performance of all other Holy Offices.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>8. <HI>Thou &s;halt not take any thing from thy Brother, whatever it be, wherewith thou art entru&s;ted, but con|tent thy &s;elf with what he &s;hall give thee for thy Reward, remembring thou ha&s;t no Right to that which belongs to another.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The&s;e eight Commandments are pre&s;crib'd to all the four Tribes in general; but be&s;ides them they have two more, which are particular to each Tribe.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>Bramines</HI> and <HI>Schuddery,</HI> that is the Prie&s;ts and Merchants, are &s;trictly oblig'd to ob&s;erve their Religious Commandments, and have near Relati|on one to another in Matters of Religion, as there is between tho&s;e of <HI>Kuttery</HI> and <HI>Wy&s;e,</HI> that is the Magi&s;trates and Handicrafts. They a&s;cribe to the <HI>Bramines,</HI> which are the Prie&s;ts, the fir&s;t and &s;econd Commandments, becau&s;e they place the chief of their Religion in the&s;e two things; fir&s;t to prevent the killing of living Creatures, and next to ab&s;tain from all forbidden things, as eating of Fle&s;h, drinking of Wine, and the like; which the <HI>Kutteries</HI> and <HI>Benjans</HI> are al&s;o &s;trictly to ob&s;erve.</P>
<P>They attribute particularly the third and fourth Commandments to <HI>Schuddery,</HI> as being very &s;uita|ble to his Office, becau&s;e it may po&s;&s;e&s;s the Peo|ple with Devotion, and prevent tho&s;e fraudulent Practi&s;es which are common among Traders.</P>
<P>To <HI>Kuttery</HI> they pre&s;cribe (being the Governors or Magi&s;trates) the fifth and &s;ixth Command|ments, becau&s;e they admoni&s;h the People of Love and Compa&s;&s;ion to the Poor, well knowing that Oppre&s;&s;ion is a common Sin among tho&s;e that are in Power.</P>
<P>They pre&s;cribe to <HI>Wy&s;,</HI> or the Handicrafts, the &s;eventh and eighth Commandments, becau&s;e tho&s;e kind of People require &s;ome Days for Re|creation. They are al&s;o forbidden to Steal, to which they have great temptations and opportu|nities, when they go to work in other Per&s;ons Hou&s;es. La&s;tly, notwith&s;tanding they are oblig'd to obey all their Commandments in general, yet every Tribe ob&s;erves tho&s;e two which are pre|&s;crib'd them, with more Zeal than any of the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Treati&s;e of the Book given to <HI>Bre|maw,</HI> contain'd the u&s;ual Ceremonial In&s;titutions to be ob&s;erv'd on certain Occa&s;ions, <HI>viz.</HI> the often wa&s;hing of their Bodies, and anointing them with certain red Salve, the making of Offerings and Prayers, and the manner of Marrying aad Bury|ing: Notwith&s;tanding all which things are be|fore declar'd at large, yet it will be requi&s;ite to
<PB N="231" REF="167">give you an account of them, as <HI>Henry Lord</HI> Tran&s;|lated them out of their Book call'd <HI>Sha&s;ter,</HI> partly for their coherence in &s;ome things, and di&s;agree|ing in others.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t they are expre&s;ly commanded to wa&s;h their Bodies in a River, which as the <HI>Benjans</HI> re|late, began in the &s;econd Age of the World, and ordain'd among other Religious Ceremonies, to mind them that the World was de&s;troy'd once by Water for their Sins. This Ceremony is us'd af|ter the following manner: Fir&s;t, they daub their Bodies all over with Mud or Dirt taken from the bottom of a River, to expre&s;s thereby the natural Pollution of Man: This done, they go to the River with their Faces turn'd towards the Sun, whil&s;t the <HI>Bramine</HI> with a loud voice &s;peaks the&s;e words:</P>
<P><HI>O Lord, this Man is foul and unclean like the Mud of this River, but as the Water is able to wa&s;h of this Filth, &s;o we pray thee to clean&s;e him of his Sins.</HI></P>
<P>This Prayer being ended, they dive three times under Water; while they are wa&s;hing them&s;elves, the <HI>Bramine</HI> often calls upon the Name of the Ri|ver, which is call'd <HI>Tappee,</HI> as al&s;o &s;ome other Streams in <HI>India,</HI> which are held in great Venera|tion, becau&s;e of their wa&s;hing them&s;elves therein: Among others that are thus accounted holy, are the Rivers <HI>Ganja</HI> and <HI>Narboda.</HI> Whil&s;t the <HI>Bramine</HI> names the&s;e Rivers, he that wa&s;hes him&s;elf throws a handful of Rice into the Prie&s;ts Lap, as an Offer|ing which they generally make to him. After which receiving an Ab&s;olution of all their &s;ins, they depart.</P>
<P>Secondly, They make u&s;e of a certain red Salve or Ointment, with which they daub or anoint their Foreheads, where they &s;tick certain Grains of Corn, &s;ignifying thereby, that God hath cho&s;en and mark'd them as a People peculiar to him; but it &s;erves only to pre&s;erve the memory of their Bapti&s;m: they anoint them&s;elves &s;everal times a day, as often as they wa&s;h them&s;elves. They utter &s;everal words, admoni&s;hing them of &s;uch things as they are commanded.</P>
<P>Thirdly, They are commanded to make Of|ferings, and &s;ay certain Prayers under the green Trees; which Cu&s;tom was In&s;tituted by <HI>Wy&s;e,</HI> to whom God appear'd under a green Tree, as we have already related, commanding him to per|form his Devotion in &s;uch Places.</P>
<P>The <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> call this Tree <HI>Lul;</HI> the <HI>Indians, Ka&s;ta;</HI> the <HI>Portugue&s;e, Arbor de Raiz,</HI> that is, <HI>Root|tree,</HI> becau&s;e its Boughs &s;hooting down into the Ground, take Root, and grow up anew, &s;o that one Tree often &s;preads it &s;elf into a great circum|ference, whereby &s;everal hundreds of Men may &s;hade them&s;elves under them, &s;ecure from the Heat of the Sun, and from Rain.</P>
<P>In one Place of this Country of <HI>Surratte,</HI> grows one of the&s;e Trees, from which the <HI>Indians</HI> dare not pluck a Leaf, fearing that they &s;hould that Year wherein they had &s;o offended. The <HI>Fakiers,</HI> and other poor People, &s;leep under the &s;ame in the Night. They believe that great Sorrow will at|tend tho&s;e that offer any Injury to this Tree, breaking the lea&s;t Bough from it; under which when they meet, each Man brings his Offerings along with him. There they anoint their Bodies with &s;everal Ointments, and pour forth their Prayers, the number of which they expre&s;s by the ringing of a Bell; and in their Prayers they crave Health, Riches, and good &s;ucce&s;s in all their Undertakings. They often meet here in great numbers, and keep great Fea&s;ts. They al&s;o build under the&s;e: Trees <HI>Pagods</HI> or Temples to their Idols, to which they &s;hew great Reverence.</P>
<P>Fourthly, They are oblig'd to &s;ay &s;everal Pray|ers in their Temples, which would have a greater &s;imilitude with the ordinary Wor&s;hip, were they freed from certain &s;uper&s;titious Ceremonies to which they are oblig'd. The&s;e their Prayers chief|ly con&s;i&s;t in often calling upon the Name of God, and extolling his glorious Works. They al&s;o go in Proce&s;&s;ions, whil&s;t their Prie&s;ts &s;ing certain Prayers at the ringing of Bells; and al&s;o making Offerings to their Images, and many &s;uch like ri|diculous Ceremonies.</P>
<P>Fifthly, They are oblig'd to go to remote Streams, as to the <HI>Ganga,</HI> there to make Offerings, and to wa&s;h their Bodies; which to perform, thou|&s;ands go thither every Year, carrying with them great quantities of Precious Stones, and other Riches, which they throw into the &s;ame. They account tho&s;e Saints, who at their Departure have their Mouths fill'd with the Water of this <HI>Ganga,</HI> or the Roof of their Mouths only moi&s;tned with the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Sixthly, They have another &s;ort of Wor&s;hip, which con&s;i&s;ts in calling upon their Saints, to whom they a&s;cribe the Power of effecting and pro&s;pering all their Undertakings: Therefore tho&s;e that de&s;ire to be happy in the State of Matri|mony, call upon <HI>Hurmount;</HI> tho&s;e that go about Building, Pray to <HI>Gunnes;</HI> in Sickne&s;s they call upon <HI>Vegenaut;</HI> the Soldiers which de&s;ire to be Victors, appeal to <HI>Bimohem;</HI> the poor and decre|pit, to <HI>Syer;</HI> and tho&s;e which live happily, im|plore <HI>Nyka&s;&s;er.</HI></P>
<P>Seventhly, They are oblig'd by virtue of the Law, to wor&s;hip God as &s;oon as any of his Crea|tures appears to them after Sun-ri&s;ing. This Reli|gious Ceremony and Sign of their Devotion, they generally &s;hew to the Sun and Moon, which they call the two Eyes of God. They al&s;o re&s;pect cer|tain Bea&s;ts, which they account more clean than others, as Goats and Buffalo's, to which they a&s;|cribe &s;uch innocency and goodne&s;s, that they rub the Floors of their Chambers with the Dung of the&s;e Bea&s;ts, fancying that thereby they are made Holy.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, It is to be ob&s;erv'd, that the manner of Baptizing and giving of Names to their Chil|dren, is not one and the &s;ame with the Tribe of the <HI>Bramines;</HI> as with all the re&s;t, who only wa&s;h their Children with Water, and afterwards one of their Relations taking a Pen, &s;eemingly writes upon the Babes Forehead, and &s;aith this &s;hort Prayer, <HI>Lord, do thou write good things on this Childs Fore|head;</HI> whereupon all tho&s;e that are pre&s;ent cry, <HI>We wi&s;h this may he effected:</HI> which done, they name the Child, and anoint its Temples with red Salve, to the end every one may know it is re|ceiv'd into the Church, and mark'd for one of the Children of God; thus ending their Ceremony.</P>
<P>But the Children of the <HI>Bramines</HI> are not only wa&s;h'd as the others, but anointed with Oyl, whil&s;t the Prie&s;t utters the following words: <HI>O Lord, we pre&s;ent thee this Child, born of a holy Tribe, anointed with Oyl, and wa&s;h'd with Water.</HI> Be&s;ides, they u&s;e &s;everal other Ceremonies; after which they Pray, that the Child may be a zealous ob&s;er|ver of the Lives of the <HI>Bramines,</HI> and &s;et down ex|actly the Hour and Minute of the Childs Birth, and ob&s;erve under what Planet it is born, that &s;o they may know whether it &s;hall be happy or un|happy,
<PB N="232" REF="168">keeping the Horo&s;cope, not &s;hewing it to any till the Day of his Marriage, which they ac|count th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> happie&s;t Day of his Life, and then pub|lickly declare all the Dangers he has e&s;cap'd, and tho&s;e which yet threaten him.</P>
<P>The third Treati&s;e of the Book which was gi|ven to <HI>Bremaw,</HI> de&s;cribes after what manner they ought to live, what difference and dictinction they mu&s;t ob&s;erve in tho&s;e things which are mention'd in their &s;everal Tribes.</P>
<P>They affirm, that there can be no better way found to Govern the World, than that which was us'd in the fir&s;t Age, by means of four Tribes; that is to &s;ay, to have <HI>Bramines</HI> to Teach the Law of God to the People; <HI>Kutteries,</HI> to Govern and keep the People in Obedience to the Law; <HI>Schudderies,</HI> or Merchants, to Trade; and la&s;tly, <HI>Wy&s;es</HI> or Handicraft-men and Laborers, to &s;upply others by their Labors with &s;uch Nece&s;&s;aries as are wanting. For this rea&s;on, by virtue of this third Treati&s;e of the foremention'd Book, they are ob|lig'd, in all their Tribes, as much as in them lies, to uphold this ancient manner of Governing.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bramines</HI> is the fir&s;t Tribe, and being lookt upon by the Commonalty as Prie&s;ts, are of two &s;orts; fir&s;t there are common <HI>Bramines,</HI> which are more in number in <HI>India</HI> than any other; &s;econdly, particular <HI>Bramines,</HI> far le&s;&s;er in number, and are by the <HI>Benjans</HI> call'd <HI>Verteas;</HI> by the Moors, <HI>Scu|rahs.</HI> The common &s;ort of <HI>Bramines</HI> con&s;i&s;t of &s;eventy two Families or Tribes, who are Go|vern'd by &s;o many eminent Men, who for their great Knowledge are highly e&s;teem'd among&s;t them; they call them Sooth&s;ayers of &s;uch and &s;uch and &s;uch a Place where they re&s;ide. The chiefe&s;t of them bears the Name of <HI>Vikalnagra|nauger,</HI> that is, <HI>Sooth&s;ayer of Vikalnagra,</HI> a City &s;o call'd. Likewi&s;e the next are denominated from the Places of their Abode; by which means the &s;eventy two Tribes are di&s;tingui&s;h'd.</P>
<P>What concerns the Offices or Employments, of the&s;e <HI>Bramines,</HI> is already related at large.</P>
<P>As to what concerns the peculiar <HI>Bramines,</HI> they are call'd <HI>Verteas,</HI> and are generally Per&s;ons of the Tribe of <HI>Schuddery,</HI> or Merchants, and are a Peo|ple who out of Zeal take upon them this Religi|ous Office. They go Habited in white Woollen Cloth, which comes down to the Calves of their Legs, the remaining part of their Legs being naked. They never cover their Heads, as a Te|&s;timony of their Obedience and Reverence they &s;hew to God: nor do they &s;have their Heads, but pull it out by the Roots, except a little upon the Crown of the Head. They al&s;o pull out their Beards after the &s;ame manner. There are &s;everal &s;orts of the&s;e <HI>Bramines,</HI> whereof &s;ome are call'd <HI>Sonkaes,</HI> which never go to the Temples, but per|form their Religious Offices by them&s;elves. Ano|ther &s;ort nam'd <HI>Tappaes,</HI> &s;ay their Prayers in the Temples. A third &s;ort call'd <HI>Kurthurs,</HI> wor&s;hip God in private without any Company. The fourth &s;ort are call'd <HI>Onkelaus,</HI> which admit of no Images. The fifth &s;ort, which is the &s;tricte&s;t of all, bear the Name of <HI>Pu&s;haleaus;</HI> the&s;e have a certain Fe&s;tival Day nam'd <HI>Putche&s;on,</HI> which they keep every Month for five Days together; but between each Day of the&s;e five they ob&s;erve a Time to Fa&s;t in. This Fea&s;t is generally kept in a Per&s;on of great Quality's Hou&s;e, and Charitable People commonly at that time, give Money to the Poor, that they may not kill any Bea&s;ts, or other Living Creature.</P>
<P>This Tribe is much &s;tricter in many things than the other <HI>Bramines;</HI> for Marriage, which is al|low'd to others, is forbidden them: and they are &s;atisfi'd with le&s;s Meat and Drink than the re&s;t, never eating any thing, except on the foremen|tion'd Fea&s;t-Day, but what is given them, and never keep any thing for the next Day, or for an|other Meal. They pre&s;erve and hold all things that have Life in greater Veneration than the other, and never drink Water till it be boil'd, to the end the Vapor, which they account the Soul thereof, &s;hould have time to evaporate and fly out. They keep little Sticks con&s;tantly by them to &s;pread abroad their own Dung, &s;o to prevent the Worms which might po&s;&s;ibly be in the &s;ame, from being trod to death. They keep Ho&s;pitals for &s;ick and lame Fowl, which they buy for Mo|ney, and endeavor to cure them, All things are in common among&s;t them. They have but a &s;len|der opinion of wa&s;hing them&s;elves in Water, but rather delight in foul and ditty Bodies.</P>
<P>The &s;econd Tribe is that of the <HI>Kutteries,</HI> which derives its Name from <HI>Kuttery,</HI> the &s;econd Son of <HI>Porous:</HI> And becau&s;e God had given him Power to Govern others, all Kings and Martial People pretend to be Extracted from them. The place of the Book of <HI>Bremaw</HI> wherein the things concern|ing this Tribe was de&s;crib'd, was fill'd with cer|tain Commandments concerning Government and State-Policy, but of little con&s;equence. The&s;e <HI>Kutteries</HI> may be de&s;crib'd the&s;e &s;everal ways, <HI>viz.</HI> How they were formerly in their flouri&s;hing E&s;tate, how they liv'd after when fir&s;t they began to decay, and how they live at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>In their flouri&s;hing E&s;tate they were Kings and Governors of the <HI>Indians,</HI> and e&s;pecially of this Country of <HI>Surratte,</HI> and were at that time call'd <HI>Rajas,</HI> that is, <HI>King</HI> or <HI>Prince;</HI> of which &s;ome po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd bigger Tracts of Land than others, according as they were more or le&s;s Powerful. The&s;e <HI>Rajas</HI> have commonly four &s;orts of Per&s;ons by them of Noble A&s;pect and Quality; the fir&s;t &s;ort whereof were <HI>Bramines,</HI> who by means of their Sooth&s;ayers acquainted their Kings with &s;uch Times as were by them accounted fortunate for any De&s;ign. The &s;econd was call'd <HI>Pardon,</HI> that is, <HI>A Politician,</HI> or one experienc'd in Matters of State, who di&s;|patch'd all the King's Edicts, and had the general Care of the King's Bu&s;ine&s;s. The third was call'd <HI>Moldar,</HI> who perform'd the Office of Gentleman-U&s;her to the King, being continually with him and his Company. The fourth, call'd <HI>Di&s;nache,</HI> ma|nag'd all Martial Affairs, and Commanded as General over all the Militia. They &s;ay, that the <HI>Rajas</HI> were Extracted out of thirty &s;ix illu&s;trious Families, &s;ome deriv'd of the Family or Tribe of <HI>Chaurah,</HI> others out of that call'd <HI>Solenkees,</HI> &s;ome of <HI>Vaggela,</HI> others of <HI>Dodepuchaes,</HI> and others from the <HI>Paramars;</HI> &s;o that a Per&s;on of mean Extract can never attain to any great Dignity, but only tho&s;e which were Extracted from one of the&s;e thirty &s;ix Tribes.</P>
<P>In this manner the <HI>Rajas</HI> liv'd in their flouri&s;hing E&s;tate; as to what concerns their Fall, according to the te&s;timony of their Hi&s;tories, a certain holy and vertuous Woman, nam'd <HI>Rannedvil,</HI> progno|&s;ticated on her Death-bed, <HI>viz.</HI> That the State of the <HI>Rajas</HI> would decline under the Government of <HI>Ravi&s;aldee,</HI> an eminent <HI>Raja;</HI> which hapned accor|dingly, as may appear by the following Relation.</P>
<P>There was formerly, as their Hi&s;tories make mention, a <HI>Raja</HI> call'd <HI>Syde Ravi&s;aldee,</HI> after who&s;e
<PB N="233" REF="168">Decea&s;e his Son built a &s;tately Tomb, in a Place call'd <HI>Sythepolapore,</HI> &s;o to expre&s;s to his Succe&s;&s;ors the Affection and Reverence he bore to his Fa|ther. When this magnificent Structure was fi|ni&s;h'd with great Labor and Charge, he con&s;ulted with the <HI>Bramines,</HI> and de&s;ir'd to know of them if the &s;tately Tomb he had built would be of any long continuance, or would be &s;ubject to decay, as well as other worldly things, &amp; by whom it &s;hould be ruin'd? Upon which a <HI>Madewnauger,</HI> experienc'd in the <HI>Bramines</HI> Art, an&s;wer'd, <HI>That a certain</HI> Sultan <HI>call'd</HI> Alaudin, <HI>King of</HI> Dely, <HI>&s;hould ruine the &s;ame, and make great Conque&s;t in</HI> Surratte. <HI>Syde Ravi&s;aldee,</HI> to prevent the ruine of this Structure, &s;ent the <HI>Bramine Madewnauger</HI> with great Sums of Money to <HI>Dely,</HI> to this <HI>Alaudin,</HI> to obtain of him, that he would let his Fathers Bones re&s;t, and not de|&s;troy the Temple he had built for him. But the <HI>Bramine</HI> coming thither, could not find any Per|&s;on of that Name, in any Government or Com|mand; but after long &s;earch, he was inform'd, that a certain Wood-cutter living there had a Son of that Name; whereupon going to this Man, who was extremely amaz'd to &s;ee him, he related to him his Journey, whil&s;t the Son of <HI>Alaudin</HI> &s;tanding behind his Father, was preparing a Di&s;h of Goats-fle&s;h. The <HI>Bramine</HI> going to him, told him of the good Fortune that &s;hould attend him, and that on a certain Day he would come to be King of <HI>Dely,</HI> and make huge Conque&s;ts in <HI>Sur|ratte;</HI> and that <HI>Syde Ravi&s;aldee</HI> had &s;ent to proffer him a great Sum of Money, reque&s;ting, that when he &s;hould be Victor, he would be pleas'd to de|fend the Temple which he had built as a Monu|ment over his Fathers Grave at <HI>Sythepolapore. Alaudin</HI> made this An&s;wer, <HI>That it was beyond all po&s;&s;ibility he &s;hould be &s;o powerful, and attain &s;uch great Fortunes, yet neverthele&s;s, if the Heavens had ordain'd it, it was not po&s;&s;ible to prevent it, and it would be im|po&s;sible for him to defend that Temple.</HI> He al&s;o gene|rou&s;ly refus'd the Pre&s;ents and the Money which the <HI>Bramine</HI> proffer'd him; but his Father and Mother, whom his Nece&s;&s;ity gave good Advice to, and knew better than he what was good for them, per&s;uaded him to receive the Pre&s;ents, partly to relieve them&s;elves out of the pre&s;ent Indigency in which they were, and make u&s;e thereof, as an In&s;trument to attain to tho&s;e things which were Prophe&s;ied. <HI>Alaudin</HI> hereupon liking their Advice, receiv'd them, and gave to the <HI>Bramine</HI> a written Paper to this effect: <HI>That &s;ince the Heavens had ap|pointed he &s;hould fetch &s;ome Stones from this Structure, he would only take them from one Corner, without ruining it, as well to perform that which was foretold him, as to an&s;wer the Reque&s;ts of</HI> Syde Ravi&s;aldee.</P>
<P>With this Money <HI>Alaudin</HI> rais'd a con&s;iderable number of Soldiers, and happily &s;ucceeded in all his Enterprizes, in&s;omuch that being pre&s;s'd for|ward by his good &s;ucce&s;s, and emboldned by the Prophe&s;ie, that he &s;hould do &s;uch valiant Exploits, he at la&s;t attain'd to be King of <HI>Dely,</HI> conquer'd <HI>Surratte,</HI> and perfom'd that which he had promis'd <HI>Syde Ravi&s;aldee;</HI> and al&s;o ruin'd many <HI>Rajas,</HI> to the great prejudice of the State of the <HI>Benjans,</HI> who then began to decline. But at la&s;t being wearied with the toil and care of War, which continu'd a long time, and was very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rouble&s;om, becau&s;e ma|ny <HI>Rajas</HI> retreated into inacce&s;&s;ible Places, he ap|pointed one <HI>Futter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on</HI> to compleat his Victories.</P>
<P><HI>Alaudin</HI> &s;eeing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat Fortune had rais'd him from nothing to the highe&s;t Degree of Honor, he re|&s;olv'd to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re his Happine&s;s with him who had the lea&s;t thoughts thereof, and &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider|ing thereupon a whole Night, he concluded to give the Government of all tho&s;e Places which he po&s;&s;e&s;s'd in <HI>Surratte,</HI> to the fir&s;t that &s;hould come and offer him any Pre&s;ents; when, ju&s;t as if it had been appointed, <HI>Futterkon</HI> came into his Cham|ber to proffer him a Gla&s;s of Wine; which <HI>Alau|din</HI> receiv'd with great joy, and immediately in the Face of his whole Army declar'd <HI>Futterkon</HI> Succe&s;&s;or of all tho&s;e Dominions which he had or &s;hould attain, and commanded all his Officers to &s;hew him the Re&s;pect due to him as his Succe&s;&s;or, and to obey and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in all things which were nece&s;&s;ary for the carrying on and fini&s;hing the al|ready begun Conque&s;ts. After which <HI>Alaudin</HI> retir'd to <HI>Dely,</HI> whil&s;t <HI>Futterkon</HI> pro&s;ecuted his Conque&s;ts of <HI>Surratte,</HI> which the other <HI>Mahume|tans</HI> that &s;ucceeded him in the Government of his Dominions compleated, to the de&s;truction of the Realm of the <HI>Benjans.</HI></P>
<P>As to what concerns their pre&s;ent Condition, &s;ome <HI>Rajas</HI> that were in a good Condition, and others that retir'd into the middle of the Country, into Places which could not be conquer'd, are yet in Being, and Rob tho&s;e Caravans which Travel by the Places of their Re&s;idence, and often Sally out to the Gates of the mo&s;t &s;trong and populous Cities for Booty. They have many brave Soldi|ers that accompany them in the&s;e Enterpri&s;es, who are by &s;ome call'd <HI>Ra&s;phootes,</HI> or <HI>Rasboten,</HI> and <HI>Rasbookes,</HI> and by others <HI>Resbuten, Ra&s;pouten, Rei&s;|butos,</HI> and <HI>Ragipous,</HI> which &s;ignifie <HI>Kings Children;</HI> for being of the Tribe of the <HI>Kutteries,</HI> in all pro|bability they were deriv'd from tho&s;e Noble Per|&s;ons that were de&s;troy'd in the Conque&s;t of <HI>Sur|rate.</HI> Among tho&s;e that were not conquer'd, and are at pre&s;ent living, is one <HI>Raja Surmulgee,</HI> who&s;e Re&s;idence is at <HI>Ra&s;peplaw;</HI> another <HI>Raja Berum|&s;haw,</HI> at <HI>Molere;</HI> the <HI>Raja Ramnagar, Raja Burmul|gee,</HI> and the great <HI>Raja Rannah,</HI> who have main|tain'd many a Field-Battel again&s;t the <HI>Great Mo|gol</HI>s Army. There are above a hundred <HI>Rajas</HI> or <HI>Pagan</HI> Princes &s;prinkled up and down in this Realm, that are not under Subjection to the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> nor pay any Tribute to him: &s;ome of them dwell near, others a good di&s;tance from <HI>Dely;</HI> among them are fifteen or &s;ixteen very rich and powerful, but chiefly five or &s;ix; as the <HI>Raja</HI> re&s;i|ding in the Country of <HI>Je&s;&s;elmeer,</HI> who formerly Reign'd as Emperor over the <HI>Rajas,</HI> and is &s;aid to be Extracted from King <HI>Porous;</HI> and likewi&s;e <HI>Je&s;|&s;eingue,</HI> and <HI>Je&s;&s;om&s;eingue,</HI> which are rais'd to that heighth, that if tho&s;e three would but joyn toge|ther, they would keep the <HI>Mogol</HI> &s;ufficiently em|ploy'd, each of them being able in an in&s;tant to bring twenty thou&s;and Hor&s;e into the Field, bet|ter Exercis'd and Arm'd than tho&s;e of the <HI>Mogol.</HI></P>
<P>The pre&s;ent <HI>Great Mogol</HI>'s chiefe&s;t Soldiers are <HI>Rajas,</HI> as <HI>Je&s;&s;eingue, Je&s;&s;om&s;eingue,</HI> and others, to whom he gives great Salaries, to be always prepa|red with a certain number of <HI>Ragipouts,</HI> their Sub|jects, and maintains and keeps them as <HI>Omrahs,</HI> that is to &s;ay, as other &s;trange Lords and <HI>Mahume|tans,</HI> &s;ometimes among tho&s;e Forces which he al|ways has to Guard him, and &s;ometimes in the Field. The&s;e <HI>Rajas</HI> are commonly oblig'd to per|form the &s;ame Duties that the <HI>Omrahs</HI> do, that is, to be upon the Guard, though with this di&s;tincti|on, they do it not in any Garri&s;ons like the <HI>Omrahs,</HI> but in their Tents, for they cannot brook being lock'd up twenty four hours together in a Fort; nor do they ever go into any of them, but with a
<PB N="234" REF="169">great Company of re&s;olute Men, which have &s;worn to die by them on the Spot, as it &s;ometimes happens when any De&s;ign has been plaid upon them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mogol</HI> is oblig'd for &s;everal Rea&s;ons to keep the&s;e <HI>Rajas</HI> in his Service: Fir&s;t, becau&s;e the <HI>Ra|jas</HI> People are very warlike and valiant, and there are &s;everal of them able to bring above twenty thou&s;and Hor&s;e into the Field. Secondly, that he may be the better able to keep in Subjection tho&s;e <HI>Rajas</HI> which are under his Pay, and force them to pay Tribute when they refu&s;e, or when out of fear or otherwi&s;e they will not venture out of their Country to come into the Field when the <HI>Mogol</HI> has occa&s;ion for them. Thirdly, to heighten or in|crea&s;e their Jealou&s;ies one among the other the more, by &s;hewing greater Favor to one than to an|other. Fourthly, to employ them again&s;t the <HI>Pa|tans,</HI> or his Enemies the <HI>Omrahs</HI> and Governors, in ca&s;e any &s;hould offer to rebell again&s;t him. Fifth|ly, to u&s;e them again&s;t the King of <HI>Golkonda,</HI> when he refu&s;es to pay Tribute; or again&s;t the King of <HI>Vi&s;iapour,</HI> when he offers to Plunder them, or bring them under his Subjection; at which time the <HI>Mogol</HI> cannot repo&s;e any confidence in his <HI>Om|rahs,</HI> which are mo&s;t of them <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and of ano|ther Religion, <HI>viz.</HI> not <HI>Sounnys,</HI> but <HI>Chias,</HI> as the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and the King of <HI>Golkonda</HI> is. Sixth|ly, and chiefly, to employ them again&s;t the <HI>Per&s;i|ans,</HI> when any opportunity pre&s;ents, for then he cannot confide in his <HI>Omrahs,</HI> who, as we &s;aid be|fore, are mo&s;t of them <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> and con&s;equently can have no inclination to Fight again&s;t their na|tural King.</P>
<P>The Country of the <HI>Re&s;butes</HI> borders on the &s;ide of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> to the <HI>Motages,</HI> on the &s;ides of the Ri|ver <HI>Indus</HI> at the City <HI>Cambaya;</HI> al&s;o to the King|dom of <HI>Dely,</HI> and Southerly to the Sea.</P>
<P>According to <HI>Purchas,</HI> this Country lies in the Road that leads from <HI>Surratte</HI> to <HI>Agra,</HI> and (as <HI>Maf|fee</HI> affirms) borders on the We&s;t at <HI>Carmania;</HI> though more probably, as <HI>Davity</HI> hath it, <HI>Gedro&s;ia,</HI> or the Country of the <HI>Motages</HI> or <HI>Nautaques.</HI></P>
<P>The Towns of this Country are <HI>Agra, Crodi, Vami&s;ta, Argeng,</HI> and <HI>Saurou;</HI> which la&s;t hath a ve|ry &s;trong Ca&s;tle, be&s;ides the great City <HI>Sarruna;</HI> from whence it is fourteen Leages to <HI>Sinde,</HI> the Metropolis of this Kingdom. The Inhabitants al|&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;everal &s;trong Places, among&s;t which is <HI>Dewras.</HI></P>
<P>This Country is very fruitful, and of an exceed|ing fat Soil, producing abundance of all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions, having plenty of all things on the very Mountains.</P>
<P>The <HI>Re&s;butes,</HI> or Subjects of the&s;e <HI>Rajas</HI> or <HI>Indi|an</HI> Princes, were anciently, in the time of the <HI>Heathens,</HI> Kings of Countries, and Peers of this Realm, who defended their Country again&s;t In|vaders, maintaining a continual War; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow they live in the Mountains, maintaining Wars a|gain&s;t the Moors, to avoid paying Tribute.</P>
<P>This Tribe hath &s;pread it &s;elf very much, and is extreamly inclin'd to Robbing and Stealing, from whence in <HI>India</HI> they call a Robber <HI>Re&s;but</HI> or <HI>Ra&s;apout. Ram</HI> granted them the liberty of taking as many Wives as they pleas'd, as al&s;o other war|like Families, that &s;o the Soldiers might not &s;ettle their Affections in one Place, but might be the freer to make Conque&s;t, and propagate where&s;o|e're they came; for were they confin'd to one Woman, they might perhaps take her along with them to their conquer'd Places, and &s;etling there, be unwilling to depart thence.</P>
<P>The <HI>Re&s;butes</HI> are a ru&s;tick, deceitful, ill-natur'd, but yet a &s;trong, valiant, and undaunted People, fearing no Dangers, though threatned with Death; whereas other <HI>Indian Heathens</HI> are mean &s;pirited and timerous, carrying their Arms in their Mouths, and e&s;teem Railing before Fighting.</P>
<P>They are very famous for Robbing and Steal|ing; for they Plunder the Caravans, and murder all Travellers they meet with, if they make the lea&s;t Re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>They have &s;everal little Harbors for &s;mall Barques, with which they Pyrate along the Coa&s;t.</P>
<P>They go naked from their Navel upwards, and wear <HI>Turbants,</HI> which differ in fa&s;hion from the <HI>Mogols.</HI></P>
<P>Their chiefe&s;t and only care, from the elde&s;t to the younge&s;t, is how to handle a Sword well.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rajas,</HI> or Kings of the <HI>Ragipous,</HI> give their Subjects Lands for their Sub&s;i&s;tance, on condition they &s;hallal ways be ready to Fight when call'd to it; &s;o that they might properly be &s;tyl'd a &s;ort of Nobles, if the <HI>Rajas</HI> gave them Lands for them and their Children. They drink <HI>Amfion</HI> in great abundance, which they u&s;e from their Infancy; and when at any time they go to meet their Ene|mies, they take a double Portion: for <HI>Amfion</HI> em|boldning, or rather inebriating, makes them fear|le&s;s of any Danger; &s;o that they maintain a Bat|tel like &s;o many ravenous Bea&s;ts, never retreating, but die re&s;olutely at the Feet of their <HI>Raja.</HI> They want nothing but good Di&s;cipline to make them good Soldiers, for Strength and Valor they have enough. It is very plea&s;ant to &s;ee them intoxica|ted with the foremention'd <HI>Amfion,</HI> how they em|brace and bid each other farewel, like Men ma|king account of nothing but Death: For among &s;o many Sects of <HI>Hindouns</HI> or <HI>Heathens</HI> &s;ubject to the <HI>Mogol,</HI> there is only one Tribe of Soldiers or Fighting People call'd <HI>Re&s;butees,</HI> of whom the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> for their Valor, and &s;ome other Rea|&s;ons, is nece&s;&s;itated, though a <HI>Mahumetan,</HI> and con|&s;equently a <HI>Heathen,</HI> to entertain a great number in his Service, treating them like other <HI>Omrahs,</HI> and making u&s;e of them in his Army as if they were <HI>Mahumetans;</HI> nay, they are promoted to the greate&s;t Offices, and highe&s;t Employments under the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> as al&s;o under the King of <HI>Vi&s;ia|pour</HI> and <HI>Golkonda.</HI> Their Arms are Half-pikes, Swords or Simiters, and Shields; which being large and hollow, are fa&s;hion'd like a Bee-hive, and &s;erve them to feed their Hor&s;es and Camels out of. Mo&s;t of the <HI>Rajas</HI> u&s;e Hor&s;es which are &s;wift of foot, hand&s;om, and &s;trong, and are always rid un&s;hod.</P>
<P>The <HI>Re&s;butes</HI> eat all manner of Meat, except Beef and the Fle&s;h of Buffalo's; which Bea&s;ts they hold in great Veneration. They drink Palm-Wine and Brandy, but not out of a Ve&s;&s;el out of which any other Tribes have drank before. They are all of them <HI>Heathens,</HI> and would never permit any <HI>Mahumetans</HI> to mix among&s;t them.</P>
<P>The Women re&s;olutely leap into tho&s;e Fires in which their Husbands were con&s;um'd.</P>
<P>The third Tribe or Family, which is that of the <HI>Schudderies,</HI> derives its Name from <HI>Schuddery,</HI> the third Son of <HI>Pourous</HI> and <HI>Parkoutee,</HI> who was de&s;ign'd for Trade; for all Traders are compre|hended under that Name and Tribe.</P>
<P>That which the Book given to <HI>Bremaw</HI> expre&s;t concerning this Tribe, con&s;i&s;ted only in a few Commandments, in&s;tructing them how to live Honorably in their Emyloyments, to be Ju&s;t as
<PB N="235" REF="169">well in Words as Deeds, and not to practi&s;e any Deceit or Fraud in their Trades, either in Buying or Selling.</P>
<P>Among&s;t this Tribe are tho&s;e which by the <HI>Por|tugue&s;e,</HI> according to <HI>Texeira,</HI> are call'd <HI>Beneans,</HI> though he affirms their right Name to be <HI>Vaneans;</HI> but their common Name is <HI>Benjans.</HI></P>
<P>Some a&s;cribe a peculiar Country to the <HI>Benjans,</HI> and border the &s;ame on one &s;ide of the Kingdom of <HI>Brampous,</HI> from which it is &s;eparated by the River <HI>Tynde,</HI> and on the other at the Country <HI>Surratte.</HI></P>
<P>The Towns of this Country are <HI>Daytaote</HI> near <HI>Surratte,</HI> and a Days Journey from <HI>Naubonne; Ne|therbey</HI> and <HI>Saylote,</HI> five Leagues from <HI>Netherkey.</HI></P>
<P>The Country yields all &s;orts of Grain and Fruit in great abundance, e&s;pecially Lemmons, Sugar-Canes, and Cotton.</P>
<P>Under the Name of <HI>Benjans</HI> are comprehended all tho&s;e that are Merchants and Broakers; for there is nothing bought but by the Mediation and Approbation of tho&s;e which are call'd <HI>Benjans,</HI> which in the Language of the <HI>Brahmines</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>An Innocent and Ju&s;t People;</HI> for they cannot en|dure that a Wa&s;p or Flye, or any other living Creature, &s;hould be hurt, enduring patiently to be beaten without re&s;i&s;tance. They manife&s;t them&s;elves to be a very Ju&s;t and Pious People; for which rea&s;on, and becau&s;e they are well ac|quainted with the Country, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchants employ them as Broakers, to Buy and Sell for them. They range all over <HI>A&s;ia</HI> in great numbers to Traffick, but re&s;ide chiefly in <HI>Surratte.</HI> Moreover, they Buy and Sell after a &s;trange and peculiar manner, quite different from any other People; for the <HI>Benjan</HI> or Broaker that treats with the Seller, making a Price of the Goods, appears with a little Board full of Figures, which is ty'd about his Wa&s;te, and laying it on his Knee, points to the number of Guilders which the Buyer is willing to give; after which the Seller in like manner expre&s;&s;es his Mind, by pointing to the Number which he will have for his Commodity.</P>
<P>Thus they Buy and Sell without &s;peaking a word, according to the Commandments of their Law.</P>
<P>The fourth Tribe or Family, which is that of the <HI>Wy&s;es,</HI> hath its Denomination from <HI>Wy&s;e,</HI> the fourth Son of <HI>Pourous</HI> and <HI>Parkoutee,</HI> who was &s;ent to invent all Arts and Handicrafts; wherefore all Arti&s;ts and Mechanicks are comprehended under this Tribe: The Commandments relating to them, and contain'd in the Book deliver'd to <HI>Bre|maw,</HI> tend chiefly to in&s;truct them how to behave them&s;elves ju&s;tly and hone&s;tly in their Employ|ments.</P>
<P>The Name <HI>Wy&s;e</HI> &s;ignifies <HI>A Hireling,</HI> or one that is us'd like a Servant, becau&s;e the&s;e People work for tho&s;e that have occa&s;ion for them, as <HI>Wy&s;e</HI> did, and all tho&s;e that deriv'd from him.</P>
<P>This Tribe con&s;i&s;ts of two &s;orts of People; for &s;ome like the <HI>Benjans,</HI> ab&s;tain from Fle&s;h and Wine, or u&s;e them very &s;paringly: The others are the <HI>Heathens</HI> of <HI>Vi&s;ceraun,</HI> which they call <HI>De|fil'd,</HI> or <HI>Unclean Pagans,</HI> becau&s;e they allow them|&s;elves the liberty of eating Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h, and other Creatures that had Life. The&s;e are generally the Ru&s;ticks, and meane&s;t &s;ort of People, which are <HI>Coulees.</HI> And as the mo&s;t zealous of the&s;e <HI>Heathens</HI> have the greate&s;t re&s;emblance in Points of their Religion with the <HI>Kutteries,</HI> &s;o do they likewi&s;e agree in the number of their Tribes, which are thirty &s;ix, equal to the Trades among them.</P>
<P>In all Mechanical Operations they u&s;e as few Tools as is po&s;&s;ible, performing every thing they do in a contrary manner to that of the <HI>Europeans</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI></P>
<P>This is in &s;hort the Contents of the third Trea|ti&s;e of the Book of <HI>Bremaw,</HI> concerning the four Tribes or Families, according as they live to this day.</P>
<P>This Book, which contain'd the Grounds of their Religion, and Rules of Government, being fir&s;t given to <HI>Bremaw,</HI> and by him deliver'd to the <HI>Brahmines,</HI> who publi&s;h'd the &s;ame among the People, by teaching them the Precepts of Religi|on, and Rules of Life which each Tribe were to ob&s;erve; in order to which, tho&s;e who had Power to Govern, kept their People in &s;ubjection, cau|&s;ing every one duly to perform his Office; the Prie&s;ts or <HI>Brahmines</HI> in&s;tructed the People in their Religions, the Merchants drove the Trade, and the Handicrafts follow'd each their &s;everal Cal|lings, to the great &s;atisfaction of all tho&s;e that made u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>Affairs being thus manag'd in the &s;econd Age, all things went very well; Religion was &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd and honor'd, Prayers were directed to God, and the three Per&s;ons, <HI>Bremaw, Wi&s;tney,</HI> and <HI>Ruddery;</HI> the Banks of Rivers were frequently vi|&s;ited, and the daily and u&s;ual Clean&s;ing never neg|lected.</P>
<P>But after the World increa&s;ed, the Inhabitants thereof grew wicked, and degenerated from their fir&s;t Principles; the <HI>Brahmines</HI> became Di&s;&s;em|blers; the <HI>Kutteries</HI> or Governors grew proud and ambitious, oppre&s;&s;ing their Subjects, and abu&s;ing their Authority; the Merchants dealt fraudulent|ly; the Handicrafts grew idle, and &s;et too high a Price upon their Lahor.</P>
<P>The World thus degenerating, God was ex|tremely incens'd thereat, and de&s;cended on the Mountain <HI>Merapurbatee,</HI> where he acquainted <HI>Bre|maw</HI> how hainous the Sins of Mankind were, that he might admoni&s;h them to turn from their wicked Ways, and warn them of the approaching Judg|ments which their Offences had ju&s;tly merited.</P>
<P>The World hearkned a while to his Admoni|tions; but &s;oon after &s;lighted them, and return'd to the commi&s;&s;ion of their former Crimes, which oblig'd <HI>Bremaw</HI> to intreat God for them: but God being unwilling to be reconcil'd to them, took him away, his limited time being expir'd, that &s;o he might not be a Witne&s;s of tho&s;e dreadful Judg|ments that &s;oon after were to fall upon the Chil|dren of Men.</P>
<P>Then God acquainted <HI>Wi&s;tney</HI> with his Re&s;olu|tion to de&s;troy all humane Creatures: wherefore <HI>Wi&s;tney</HI> interceded for them; but God not heark|ning to him, commanded <HI>Ruddery,</HI> who was ap|pointed to puni&s;h all Offenders, to rai&s;e a great Wind out of the Earth to de&s;troy the People, and blow them away like Du&s;t from the Ground.</P>
<P><HI>Ruddery</HI> hereupon provok'd the Winds which were impri&s;on'd in the Bowels of the Earth, cau|&s;ing them to break forth with great violence, in&s;o|much that they &s;hook the Foundations of the Earth; the Day grew as dark as the Night, the Hills and Mountains were turn'd top&s;ie-turvy, and the River <HI>Ganges</HI> remov'd out of its place; &s;o that this terrible Storm de&s;troy'd all Mankind, ex|cept a few Per&s;ons, whom God permitted <HI>Wi&s;tney</HI> to pre&s;erve, for the propagating and re-peopling the World in the third Age, the &s;econd being ended in this di&s;mal manner.</P>
<PB N="236" REF="170">
<P>When <HI>Ruddery</HI> had a&s;&s;wag'd the rage and fury of the Winds, all things were &s;till and quiet, yet in a deplorable Condition, to &s;ee the World thus depriv'd of its Inhabitants, and utterly ruin'd; &s;ome were bruis'd again&s;t the Rocks, others lay heap'd one upon another in the Fields; which the Almighty &s;eeing, was troubled at it, and <HI>Ruddery</HI> al&s;o very much griev'd to have been the In&s;tru|ment of &s;o great a De&s;truction.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince the&s;e great Misfortunes and Pu|ni&s;hments proceeded from the bad Conduct of the Kings, and tho&s;e who Govern'd, God utterly de&s;troy'd the Tribe of the <HI>Kutteries.</HI> Tho&s;e that were &s;av'd by the Prayers of <HI>Wi&s;tney,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted in a &s;mall number, and were only of the three other Tribes. But becau&s;e the four &s;orts of Tribes were &s;o perfectly nece&s;&s;ary for the Governing of the World, in&s;omuch that it could not be without them, and God had wholly de&s;troy'd the Family of the <HI>Kutteries,</HI> therefore he re&s;olv'd to renew the &s;ame by a Prince, and ordain'd that the Kings for the future &s;hould be Extracted out of the Family of the <HI>Brahmines,</HI> the chiefe&s;t whereof that were then living having been pre&s;erv'd by <HI>Wi&s;tney,</HI> were call'd <HI>Ducerat.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Child which was born after this uni|ver&s;al De&s;truction, was ordain'd to be the Race of Kings and Princes; who being zealou&s;ly brought up, manag'd both the Affairs of State and Religi|on, Governing the People with great Wi&s;dom and Piety, according to their &s;everal Tribes; per|form'd many heroick Acts, and was a Protector of all <HI>Brahmines</HI> and other Spiritual Per&s;ons. His Name was <HI>Ram,</HI> and by his Ju&s;t and Pious Life at|tain'd to that Dignity, that his Name is to this day exceedingly honor'd among&s;t them; for in their u&s;ual Salutations they with a loud Voice cry <HI>Ram, Ram,</HI> that is, <HI>I wi&s;h you Health and all Happine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis certain many Ju&s;t and Pious Kings Reign'd after him, but as all things do daily degenerate, &s;o in proce&s;s of Time receding farther and farther from their original Purity, they grew proud and ambitious, in&s;omuch that they acted daily contra|ry to the Commandments comprehended in the Book of <HI>Bremaw.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e hainous Enormities did once more &s;o highly incen&s;e the Almighty, that he gave Pow|er to <HI>Ruddery</HI> to open the Earth, that it might &s;wallow them up alive, except a few of each of the four Tribes, which he pre&s;erv'd to re-people the World anew with. And in this manner ended the third Age of the World.</P>
<P>Soon after God commanded that the World &s;hould be re-planted by tho&s;e that were pre&s;erv'd, which was one <HI>Ky&s;teney</HI> or <HI>Ki&s;tna,</HI> who was a fa|mous King, Wi&s;e and Religious, and one of the mo&s;t comely Per&s;ons of the former Age. He pro|pagated Religion with great Zeal, in&s;omuch that during his Life there was great Reformation a|mong&s;t the People, and very hopeful beginnings of Piety and Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>When by <HI>Ky&s;teney</HI>'s coming <HI>Wi&s;tney</HI>'s time was expir'd, God (as they relate) took him up to Hea|ven, there being no further need of his, Service here below, becau&s;e there would be no other World after this fourth Age; which, now in be|ing, will (according to the Opinion of the <HI>Brah|mines</HI>) la&s;t much longer than any of the former; and that after its ruine, <HI>Ruddery</HI> will be taken up to Heaven likewi&s;e.</P>
<P>They call the&s;e four Ages by four &s;everal Names, <HI>viz.</HI> the fir&s;t <HI>Kurtain,</HI> the &s;econd <HI>Dnau|per,</HI> the third <HI>Tetrajos,</HI> and the fourth <HI>Kolee.</HI></P>
<P>The manner of de&s;troying this la&s;t Age will, as the <HI>Brahmines</HI> relate, be much more terrible than any of the former, to wit, by Fire: at what time <HI>Ruddery</HI> will gather all his Powers together, as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the execution of &s;o grand a De&s;truction. The Moon will &s;hine red, the Beams of the Sun will be like the Flames of burning Brim&s;tone; Thunder and Lightning will make a dreadful noi&s;e; the Sea will change into all manner of Colours, and Fire and Smoke will cover the &s;urface of the Earth; the four Ele|ments, of which the Heavens were fir&s;t made, will maintain War again&s;t one another, and the World being thereby utterly de&s;troy'd, will re|&s;olve into its fir&s;t <HI>Primordia.</HI></P>
<P>The World will be de&s;troy'd by Fire, as they &s;uppo&s;e, for this rea&s;on, That it mu&s;t be extin|gui&s;h'd by that which gave it beginning; and be|cau&s;e it con&s;i&s;ts of Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, therefore it mu&s;t be de&s;troyd by the&s;e four Ele|ments; for the former Ages (on which this Opi|nion is grounded) were de&s;troy'd, the fir&s;t by Wa|ter, the &s;econd by Wind, and the third by Earth; therefore the fourth and la&s;t mu&s;t be con&s;um'd by Fire.</P>
<P>This being fini&s;h'd, <HI>Ruddery</HI> &s;hall carry all hu|mane Souls up to Heaven, there to re&s;t in the Bo&s;om of the Almighty; but all Bodies will de|cay: for they deny the Re&s;urrection of the Body, affirming, That Heaven is too pure a Place for &s;uch gro&s;s and unclean Bodies.</P>

After his Decea&s;e the Inhabitants de|fending the Place for &s;ome time, kept the <HI>Mogol</HI> continually employ'd; who, after he had us'd all po&s;&s;ible means in vain, having no great Guns at hand wherewith to batter down the Walls, at la&s;t re&s;olv'd to try if he could purcha&s;e the Inhabitants to a Surrender by great Sums of Money; which to accompli&s;h, he &s;ent to the Governors very con|&s;iderable Pre&s;ents of Gold and Silver; whereby he did &s;o cool and abate their Courage, that none of the &s;even Succe&s;&s;ors of the Realm dur&s;t a&s;&s;ume the Government; for they perceiving the Gene|rals to be fearful, and their Courage no longer to exert it &s;elf, could fore&s;ee and expect nothing but the &s;udden lo&s;s of the Place; and accordingly it &s;o fell out: for after a few Days the Fort was &s;ur|rendred, and with it the whole Kingdom was &s;ub|jected to the <HI>Mogol,</HI> who got peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof, with an invaluable Trea&s;ure. He recei|ved all the Inhabitants favourably, except the im|pri&s;on'd King and the &s;even &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Princes, whom he di&s;per&s;ed into &s;everal Provinces, allow|ing King <HI>Miram</HI> three thou&s;and, and each of the other two thou&s;and Ducats <HI>per Annum</HI> for their Maintenance.</P>

<P>THe Kingdom or Province of <HI>Agra</HI> is &s;o call'd from <HI>Agra,</HI> the Royal Metropolis of the <HI>Great Mogol</HI>'s whole Kingdom, be|&s;ides <HI>Dely</HI> and <HI>Lahor.</HI> Others call it <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> or <HI>In|dou&s;tan,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>The Country of Indus:</HI> for <HI>Stan</HI> in the Country Language is <HI>A Country</HI> or <HI>Pro|vince,</HI> and <HI>Indus</HI> is the Name of the River <HI>Indus,</HI> which moi&s;tens the Country. It borders on one &s;ide upon the Stream <HI>Paddor,</HI> which &s;eparates it from the <HI>Henderons,</HI> and conterminates on the o|ther &s;ide with the River <HI>Tamliko</HI> or <HI>Tamlou,</HI> which is a Boundary between this and the Country Inha|bited by the <HI>Bulloits.</HI></P>
<P>The Metropolis bears the &s;ame Name with the Province of <HI>Agra,</HI> and lies in 28 Degrees and 7 Minutes North Latitude, on the Banks of the River <HI>Jemini,</HI> which glides by its Walls, and di&s;|embogues near the City <HI>Andakoda,</HI> into the River <HI>Ganges,</HI> two days Journey from <HI>Agra.</HI></P>
<P>According to <HI>Herbert,</HI> this City was formerly call'd <HI>Nagra,</HI> and anciently <HI>Diony&s;ia,</HI> and was built by <HI>Bacchus;</HI> but this &s;eems incredulous, becau&s;e within this hundred years the City <HI>Ratipor</HI> was far more beautiful, and bigger than that of <HI>Agra,</HI> which is believ'd to have had its Denomination from the River <HI>Arrany,</HI> which (as <HI>Arrian</HI> affirms) falls into the <HI>Ganges.</HI> It was built by King <HI>Ekbar</HI> after his Conque&s;t of <HI>Surratte,</HI> and for its plea&s;ant Situation made choice of for the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Court and chief Place of Re&s;idence. It lies almo&s;t Triangu|lar, or (as <HI>Herbert</HI> &s;aith) Semi-Circular, &s;urround|ed with a &s;trong Walk of Free-Stone, and a Moat of a hundred Paces broad. The Circumference of the City is reckon'd to be twelve <HI>German</HI> Miles. The Streets, which are very &s;traight, are dirty, and three Leagues and a half long.</P>
<P>In the Northern part of the City, not far from the River, lies, the great and famous Royal Ca&s;tle,
<PB N="239" REF="171">or Re&s;idence of the Kings, which is the mo&s;t beau|tiful and glorious Piece of Work in all <HI>A&s;ia.</HI> It appears outwardly like a City, containing five hundred and twenty Paces in circumference. The Structure is for the mo&s;t part built of Free-&s;tone, with many Galleries and Piazzaes, very &s;tately, after the manner of the Country.</P>
<P>At the Entrance of this Ca&s;tle &s;tands the Royal Court of Judicature, in the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tongue call'd <HI>Diwanchane;</HI> before which is a large &s;quare <HI>Maidan</HI> or Plain, planted about with Trees; un|der which Per&s;ons of Quality in hot Weather walk to cool them&s;elves. In the middle of the Plain &s;tands a Pole, having a Bird on the top of it, at which they &s;hoot with Bows and Arrows.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to this Court &s;tands a large &s;quare Building call'd <HI>Karchanay Schah,</HI> that is, <HI>The King's Trea&s;ure-hou&s;e,</HI> with eight Arch'd Vaults, in which are kept the greate&s;t part of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Trea&s;ure. Two of the&s;e Cellers are reported to be full of Gold, and two of Silver; in the &s;eventh are kept Pearls, Gems, and other &s;uch like Rarities; and in the eighth are contain'd all &s;uch Pre&s;ents as are &s;ent from forein Princes by Amba&s;&s;adors.</P>
<P>Behind this Trea&s;ury &s;tands another large &s;quare Palace, with a very delightful Garden, and is call'd <HI>Hara Michan,</HI> that is, <HI>The King's Wo|mens Lodgings;</HI> for in it are kept twelve hundred of the King's Concubines, which are guarded and waited upon by &s;ix hundred Eunuchs.</P>
<P>Others de&s;cribe this Court thus: It is three or four Leagues in circumference, &s;urrounded with &s;trong Walls of red Stone, and broad Moats with Draw-Bridges; it hath four Gates, one on the North, which is very &s;trong; the &s;econd on the We&s;t &s;ide, is call'd <HI>Cit&s;ery,</HI> near the <HI>Bezar</HI> or Mar|ket. Within this Gate is the King's Court of Ju|dicature, where he decides all Differences; and behind that is the King's Hall, the Seat of the Vice-Roys. Within this Gate is al&s;o a Street built full of Hou&s;es, and about a Mile long. The third Gate, call'd <HI>Achabaerbederiwage,</HI> that is, <HI>The Gate of King Achbaer,</HI> lies on the South &s;ide, and and leads to the King's <HI>Derbaer,</HI> the Royal Throne, or inner Court; before which is a &s;mall Court, &s;urrounded with Golden Rails, and cover'd on the top with Carpets, to keep off the heat of the Sun; beyond it is a Gallery, in which &s;tands the King's Throne, adorn'd with Gold, Diamonds and Pearls, and all &s;orts of Precious Stones. No Per&s;on is per|mitted to approach this Place without being call'd, except the King's Sons (which &s;tanding near him, cool him by continual fanning of him with Fans, in the Country Language call'd <HI>Pank|hamh</HI>) and the Chief Secretary.</P>
<P>Within the foremention'd Court none are &s;uf|fer'd to enter but <HI>Ommirades</HI> or <HI>Omrahs,</HI> which are Dukes and great Lords.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to this Place hang golden Bells, which are rung by tho&s;e that have &s;u&s;tain'd any preju|dice, and are thereupon admitted to &s;peak to the King, to make their Complaints to him, but not without great danger, if their Cau&s;e be not ju&s;t.</P>
<P>In this Place the King appears every After|noon, between three and four a Clock, be&s;ides thou&s;ands of other People, which take their Pla|ces according to their Qualities, and with the King &s;tay there till the Evening, hearing all fo|rein Letters, which are read by the Setretary, and determining all other Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es. Hither are al&s;o brought his Hor&s;es and Elephants, which are try'd by &s;ome of his Servants appointed for that pur|po&s;e. Within this third Gate is likewi&s;e a <HI>Sera|glio,</HI> cover'd with a golden Roof.</P>
<P>The fourth Gate call'd <HI>Eer&s;ame,</HI> leads to a River, along who&s;e Banks &s;tands a beautiful Pa|lace, where the King Salutes the Ri&s;ing-Sun every Morning, whil&s;t the mo&s;t eminent Per&s;ons of his Court &s;tanding on a ri&s;ing Ground, &s;hew him Re|verence, and the <HI>Hadys</HI> or Commanders of Hor&s;e, with other People, remain in the outward Court, not daring to come any farther, unle&s;s they are call'd. From hence al&s;o he beholds the Fighting with Elephants, Lions, Buffalo's, and other wild Bea&s;ts, which is perform'd every Day at Noon, except on Sundays.</P>
<P>In the inner Hall of the Royal Court come no People but the King's Eunuchs or Bed-chamber|men, which are call'd <HI>Godia.</HI></P>
<P>In the inner part of the Ca&s;tle are two Towers, one on the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> and the other is built on the Trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>Within the Suburbs are many Courts, belong|ing to the <HI>Chans</HI> and other great Lords, very arti|ficially built, and adorn'd with many beautiful Works; the Cielings are richly Painted with Gold and Silver, and other Colours; the Walls are hung with Tapi&s;try, and the Floor cover'd with rich Carpets.</P>

The ordinary Citizens Hou&s;es are but mean, yet built in good order. There are eight great Streets with Shops, be&s;ides many le&s;&s;er; and al&s;o four large Arch'd Streets, each about half a Mile long, where all manner of Trades and Handicraft&s;men keep their Shops, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that Deal in Silks and Cotton; Gold and Silver-Smiths, Shoemakers, Taylors, Coopers, Black&s;miths, and all other Trades, live each in a peculiar Corner. For travelling Mer|chants and others, there are eighty <HI>Serrais</HI> or <HI>Ka|ravan&s;eraes,</HI> which are large &s;quare Courts, inclo|&s;ed with high Stone Walls, at each end whereof &s;tands a Watch-Tower, out of which they go in|to the &s;everal Galleries, wherein are Lodging-Rooms, each of them having Doors to lock, and al&s;o Chimneys; there are commonly two or three Rooms one over another. Under the&s;e Chambers are great Arch'd Stables for Hor&s;es, A&s;&s;es, Oxen, and Camels; and in the mid&s;t of the Yard &s;tands a Spring with running Water, or a Vault with &s;tanding Water; they were built by the great <HI>Mogol Ekbar,</HI> after he had conquer'd the Kingdom of <HI>Surratte,</HI> and is &s;aid to have co&s;t him two Millions and a half of <HI>Ropias,</HI> a <HI>Ropia</HI> be|ing valu'd at 2 s. <HI>Sterl.</HI></P>

This Tem|ple po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great Riches and Privileges, it being an <HI>Allakapi,</HI> or Privileg'd Place: for who&s;oever flies thither, though he hath committed the great|e&s;t Crime imaginable, nay, though he had at|tempted to kill the King him&s;elf, he is free from all Puni&s;hments as long as he can &s;tay there: if he

<P>Not far from the <HI>Netherland Ea&s;t-India</HI> Compa|nies Factory which they have in this City, &s;tands a <HI>Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">zid</HI> call'd <HI>Jakod;</HI> near which lies buried a Giant call'd <HI>Baxi Schah,</HI> of whom the <HI>Moors</HI> tell many incredible &s;tories: the Grave is 36 &s;oot long, and eight broad: on each Corner &s;tands a great Column hung full of little Flags, on which in <HI>In|do&s;tan</HI> Characters &s;tands written the Life of this mighty Heroe; and in each Pillar is a Hole, in which Lamps burn Night and Day, to the Honor of <HI>Baxi Schah.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Baxi Schah</HI> is by the <HI>Mahumetans</HI> honor'd almo&s;t as high as God; for they go thither to pay their Devotions, and believe, that by Praying to him they &s;hall immediately receive Ab&s;olution for all their Sins: they al&s;o &s;wear by his Name.</P>
<P>With the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s permi&s;&s;ion the <HI>Benjans</HI> have al&s;o many <HI>Pagods</HI> in this City.</P>
<P>There are four Cu&s;tom-hou&s;es built in four &s;e|veral places of this City, where Merchants Enter and pay Cu&s;tom for their Goods, and the tenth Peny of all things they carry out of the City with them.</P>
<P>This City is inhabited by divers Nations, but the chiefe&s;t and mo&s;t eminent are the <HI>Ha&s;&s;ani&s;ts, Tar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ars, Benjans, Armenians, Turks, Jews,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> be&s;ides &s;everal <HI>Europeans.</HI> There are al&s;o <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;tine Monks.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Agra</HI> is a very populous City, and can on occa|&s;ion bring two hundred and fifty thou&s;and Men in|to the Field. In it is great &s;tore of Salt-petre and Indigo to be had, which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> carry from thence in great quantities. Not only within, but al&s;o round about the City, are very de|lightful Gardens, &s;ome whereof belong to the <HI>Mo|gol,</HI> who oftentimes goes to walk and Dine in them, whil&s;t a con&s;iderable number of Women Dance naked before him.</P>
<P>The Juri&s;diction of <HI>Agra</HI> from all Parts, extends twelve Days Journey through a Plain and fertile Country, which contains forty great and &s;mall Towns, and three thou&s;and five hundred Villages. Without the City is a Hou&s;e wherein are kept all &s;orts of wild Bea&s;ts, as Elephants, Tygers, Lions, Buffalo's, and wild Bulls, which the <HI>Mogol</HI> keeps to &s;port withal, either by letting them fight one again&s;t another, or encounter with &s;uch Men as will be accounted the mo&s;t valiant of the Coun|try, or with &s;uch as are con&s;train'd upon forfeiture of the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Favor to engage with them.</P>
<P>About the Year 1620. the City of <HI>Agra</HI> was by the <HI>Sultan Chorrom, Selim</HI>'s Son, ruin'd and plunder'd a &s;econd time with far greater cruelty of the Soldiers than formerly, perhaps in revenge for the Lo&s;s which they &s;u&s;tain'd before the Ca&s;tle, which they Storming in vain, lo&s;t many Men, who were &s;lain by the Be&s;ieged.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Agra</HI> and <HI>Lahor</HI> is a Walk planted with Trees four hundred <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Miles in length, and is by Travellers, who refre&s;h them&s;elves un|der the cool &s;hading Trees, accounted one of the mo&s;t delightful Places in the whole World, there being &s;everal brave Hou&s;es for Entertainment built along the High-way.</P>
<P>A League and a half from <HI>Agra,</HI> on the Way from <HI>Lahor,</HI> is a Place call'd <HI>Tzekander,</HI> where the <HI>Great Mogol Ekbar</HI> erected a great Burying-place for him&s;elf and his Succe&s;&s;ors; to which his Son <HI>Jangheer</HI> contributed very largely: and though there had been above twenty four Millions of <HI>Ropias</HI> be&s;tow'd on the &s;ame, yet it was not near fini&s;h'd in the Year 1626. The whole Structure is of hewn Stone, divided into four large Squares, each three hundred Paces: at the Corners of each &s;tands a little Tower of colour'd Marble. It lies in the mid&s;t of a very fine Garden, &s;urrounded with a Wall of red Stone, within which is a Turret, from which you &s;ee into a little, but exceeding de|lightful Garden.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Fettipore,</HI> or <HI>Fatipor,</HI> by <HI>Jarrick</HI> call'd <HI>Fateful</HI> or <HI>Pateful,</HI> by <HI>Cowert, Fetterbat,</HI> and by <HI>Her|bert, Fettipour,</HI> was anciently call'd <HI>Tzikkerim,</HI> or <HI>Sykary,</HI> and lies twelve <HI>Kours,</HI> or four Leagues from <HI>Agra.</HI></P>
<P>This City was upon the following occa&s;ion built by the <HI>Great Mogol Ekbar, viz.</HI> At his Re|turn from <HI>A&s;mer,</HI> whether he went to vi&s;it the Tomb of <HI>Mandy,</HI> he vi&s;ited St. <HI>Derwis,</HI> or a poor Monk call'd <HI>Seid Selim,</HI> that is, <HI>Seid Selim,</HI> who accounted him&s;elf highly honor'd, that God had employ'd him to tell <HI>Ekbar,</HI> that in a &s;hort time he &s;hould be the Father of three beautiful Children; and indeed <HI>Ekbar</HI> to acknowledge the Kindne&s;s, would have his elde&s;t Son call'd <HI>Selim,</HI> the &s;econd <HI>Chan Morad,</HI> or <HI>Amurath,</HI> and the third <HI>The Haen Schach,</HI> or <HI>Daniel:</HI> nay, this Prophecy was &s;o ac|ceptable to <HI>Ekbar,</HI> that he caus'd a fair <HI>Mo&s;que</HI> to be built there, and inclos'd both that and the an|cient City <HI>Tzikerim</HI> or <HI>Sykary,</HI> with a high Wall, and from that time caus'd it to be call'd <HI>Fettipore,</HI> that is, <HI>A Place of Delight:</HI> nay, his Affections were &s;o &s;trongly inclin'd to this City, that he built a Palace there, and al&s;o a <HI>Bazar</HI> or Exchange, the faire&s;t in all the Ea&s;tern Parts, re&s;olving far|ther to make it the Metropolis of the whole King|dom, for which it &s;tood very convenient, being &s;eated on the Bank of a River; yet the unwhol|&s;omne&s;s of the Air forc'd him to leave the &s;ame: &s;ince which time it is become a ruin'd and de&s;olate Place.</P>
<P><HI>Robert Cower</HI> affirms, that this City is much bigger than <HI>London,</HI> and is adorn'd with a Temple very artificially built, though much decay'd.</P>
<P>The whole Tract of Land between this City and <HI>Agra,</HI> is always throng'd with People like a Market.</P>
<P>The City <HI>Bian</HI> is four Leagues from <HI>Fatipor;</HI> beyond which are the Towns <HI>Ladana, Mo&s;abadan,</HI> and <HI>Banda&s;on;</HI> next lie <HI>A&s;meer</HI> or <HI>E&s;meer,</HI> where the <HI>Great Mogol Ekbar</HI> had a large Hou&s;e or Stable, in which he commonly kept &s;ix hundred Ele|phants, and a thou&s;and Hor&s;es.</P>
<P>The City <HI>A&s;meer</HI> lies in 35 Degrees and 15 Minutes Northern Latitude, on a high and inac|ce&s;&s;ible Mountain, twenty five Leagues from <HI>Agra.</HI> The greate&s;t part of the City lies at the foot of the Mountain, well built, but ill fortifi'd; notwith&s;tanding the Wall is of good Stone. A Prophet, one of <HI>Mahomet</HI>'s Di&s;ciples, lies buried there in a &s;tately Tomb, to which belong three plea&s;ant Yards, pav'd with Free-&s;tone, poli&s;h'd af|ter the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> manner.</P>

<P>There are al&s;o fair Hou&s;es at every ten Miles di&s;tance, which were built by the <HI>Great Mogol Ek|bar</HI> for the convenience of his Women, when he took a Journey to <HI>A&s;meer</HI> to vi&s;it the Tomb of <HI>Mandy, Mahomet</HI>'s Di&s;ciple.</P>
<P>The whole Country being water'd by the Stream of <HI>Jemna,</HI> aboundeth with Corn, Lem|mons, Oranges, Cherries, Pears, Apples, Plums, and other Fruit; among&s;t which are Grapes, which being pre&s;erv'd, are as big as <HI>Damas</HI> Pruins. There al&s;o grows abundance of <HI>Anil,</HI> or Indico, and &s;tore of Cotton. Saltpetre is likewi&s;e very plentiful here; and all &s;orts of Poultry, Falcons, Phea|&s;ants, Partridges, Hearns, and Wild-ducks. Here are al&s;o great &s;tore of Goats, Cows, and Hogs; and Fi&s;h in &s;uch abundance, that Eighteen pence will purcha&s;e enough to feed three hundred Men.</P>
<P>In <HI>Agra</HI> are generally kept four Markets, where be&s;ides Provi&s;ions, divers other Goods are &s;old. From <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>China</HI> are Tran&s;ported hither con|&s;iderable Quantities of Gold and Silver Cloths, which though &s;lighter, are yet dearer than tho&s;e of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>In this City, as al&s;o in <HI>Lahor,</HI> the Inhabitants drive a great Trade in <HI>Anil,</HI> or Indico; and at <HI>Banda&s;on</HI> there is va&s;t quantities of Cour&s;e Wooll, Cotton, Lances, Bowes, Javelins, Swords, and other Arms.

In the City of <HI>Gorra</HI> are kept four Publick Schools.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bulloits</HI> were formerly a deceitful and cruel People: At this day they retain that barbarous Cu&s;tom of burning the Women alive after their Husbands decea&s;e; but if any Woman refu&s;e thus bruti&s;hly to &s;acrifice her &s;elf, they then cau&s;e her Hair to be cut off, and clothe her in Black; and &s;he is ever after accounted &s;o ignominious and di&s;honorable, that not the meane&s;t Per&s;on will vouch&s;afe to a&s;&s;i&s;t or vi&s;it her.</P>

<P>The Kingdoms of <HI>Ballagate</HI> and <HI>Decan</HI> were for|merly govern'd by <HI>Heathen</HI> Kings, and inhabited by a mighty People, of which the <HI>Vena&s;ars</HI> and <HI>Collers,</HI> the pre&s;ent Inhabitants, are Succe&s;&s;ors. They joyn them&s;elves with the <HI>Reisboutes,</HI> and commit many Robberies, forcing Tribute from the Inhabitants of <HI>Decan</HI> and <HI>Ballagate,</HI> without being puni&s;h'd for the &s;ame by their King.</P>
<P>After the King of <HI>Dely</HI> had made the&s;e Con|que&s;ts, the <HI>Mogols</HI> took up Arms, and made them|&s;elves Ma&s;ters of the greate&s;t part of <HI>Dely.</HI> About the &s;ame time there was an eminent Lord of <HI>Ben|gale,</HI> who, to revenge him&s;elf of his King, for put|ting his Bother to death unju&s;tly, bereav'd him both of his Crown and Life, and afterwards fell into <HI>Dely,</HI> forc'd the <HI>Mogols</HI> to fly, and at the &s;ame time made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of all the Country of <HI>Ballagate</HI> and <HI>Cuncan,</HI> extending to the Borders of <HI>Cambaye.</HI> But he not being capable of Govern|ing &s;o many Countries, and being al&s;o de&s;irous of q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iet, re&s;olv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d to return back to <HI>Bengale,</HI> and com|mitted the Care of Governing the Kingdoms of <HI>Decan, Ballagate,</HI> and <HI>Cuncan,</HI> to one of his Ne|phews, who being a Lover of Strangers, divided tho&s;e Countries among&s;t &s;everal Lords of divers Nations, as <HI>Arabians, Turks, Rumeans,</HI> and <HI>Cora|&s;ons,</HI> giving to one whom the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> call'd <HI>Idalcan</HI> the Country of <HI>Cuncan,</HI> otherwi&s;e call'd <HI>Vi&s;iapour,</HI> or <HI>Gingive,</HI> lying eight Leagues from <HI>Goa.</HI> He al&s;o gave to one of his Captains, nam'd <HI>Nizzamaluko,</HI> the Country of <HI>Siffardan,</HI> which extends it &s;elf &s;ix Leagues to the North, along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Negotana.</HI> He divided the Kingdom of <HI>Ballagate</HI> into Provinces, and gave one part thereof to <HI>Imademaluko,</HI> another to <HI>Coralmaluko,</HI> and a third to <HI>Melik Vervide.</HI> But all the&s;e immediately rebell'd again&s;t their Lord and Benefactor, and marching to the Metropolis <HI>Beder,</HI> took the King Pri&s;oner, committing him to the cu&s;tody of <HI>Melik Vervide.</HI> They al&s;o procured &s;everal other <HI>Hea|then</HI> Princes to joyn with them in this Con&s;pira|cy, among&s;t whom were <HI>Mohade Koja,</HI> and <HI>Veriche,</HI> who po&s;&s;e&s;s'd rich Countries, repleni&s;h'd with Towns and Villages. <HI>Amohade</HI> got the Cities <HI>Vi&s;iapour, Solapor,</HI> and <HI>Paranda,</HI> lying near <HI>Goa;</HI> but not long after the City <HI>Paranda</HI> was taken by <HI>Nizzamaluko,</HI> and <HI>Salapor</HI> fell into the Hands of <HI>Idalcan,</HI> who was al&s;o call'd <HI>Sabayo,</HI> that is, <HI>Lord.</HI> He po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the I&s;land <HI>Goa,</HI> of which the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI> afterwards made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters. His Hou&s;e or Palace &s;tands yet at <HI>Goa,</HI> but is now con|verted to a Hou&s;e of Inqui&s;ition. The Place ly|ing between the Great Church and the &s;aid Hou&s;e
<PB N="245" REF="174">bears the Name of <HI>Sabayo. Idalcan,</HI> who Reign'd <HI>Anno</HI> 1535. was Grand&s;on to one of tho&s;e fore|mention'd Kings.</P>
<P>After this Divi&s;ion thus made, there was a Quarrel between <HI>Idalcan</HI> and the King of <HI>Nar|&s;inga,</HI> his Neighbor; who by his Power &s;ubduing <HI>Idalcan,</HI> and the other Kings of <HI>Decan,</HI> made them Tributaries to him: But in proce&s;s of time <HI>Idalcan,</HI> or his Succe&s;&s;ors, &s;ubdu'd all tho&s;e Countries which were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by peculiar Kings or Lords, except that of <HI>Melik,</HI> which the <HI>Mogol</HI> had conquer'd.</P>
<P><HI>F. Bernier</HI> relates, That all this great I&s;land of <HI>Hindo&s;lan,</HI> reckoning from the Bay of <HI>Cambay</HI> to that of <HI>Bengale,</HI> near <HI>Jagannate,</HI> and from thence to the Cape of <HI>Comori,</HI> was all, &s;ome Mountain|ous Parts onely excepted, about two hundred years agoe under one particular Lord or King, who was a very great and Powerful Prince: But at pre&s;ent it is divided into many Dominions; and the People are likewi&s;e of &s;everal Religions. The Rea&s;on of this Divi&s;ion was as followeth. A cer|tain <HI>Raja</HI> or King, nam'd <HI>Ramras,</HI> the la&s;t of tho&s;e which Reign'd ab&s;olute in this Country, impru|dently promoted three of his Slaves to too great Dignities, by making them Governors: <HI>viz.</HI> The fir&s;t he made Governor of a great part of that Country which the <HI>Mogol</HI> at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in <HI>Decan,</HI> round about <HI>Daulet-Abad,</HI> from <HI>Bider, Pa|randa,</HI> and <HI>Surratte,</HI> to <HI>Narbadar:</HI> To the &s;econd he gave the Government of all tho&s;e Countries which are now comprehended in the Kingdom of <HI>Vi&s;iapour;</HI> and to the third, that Part which is known by the name of the Kingdom of <HI>Golconda.</HI> The&s;e three Slaves growing very Rich and Pow|erful, and being &s;upported by many <HI>Mogols</HI> which were in the Service of <HI>Ramras,</HI> and of the &s;ame Religion with the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> agreed together to re|bell again&s;t and kill their Lord and Benefactor; which having effected, they return'd into their &s;e|veral Dominions, each of them taking upon him the Title of <HI>Schah,</HI> or <HI>King.</HI> The Succe&s;&s;ors of <HI>Ramras</HI> finding them&s;elves not able to engage in a War again&s;t the&s;e U&s;urpers, were content to re|tire and &s;eat them&s;elves in a Place call'd <HI>Carnateck</HI> or <HI>Bi&s;naguer,</HI> where to this day they Reign as <HI>Rajas</HI> or Kings. The three Slaves and their Suc|ce&s;&s;ors defended their Kingdoms very valiantly, &s;o long as they agreed among them&s;elves, and a&s;|&s;i&s;ting one another, maintain'd great Wars again&s;t the <HI>Mogols;</HI> but when they went about to defend their &s;everal Countries, they were immediately &s;en&s;ible of their Divi&s;ion, to their great prejudice, being &s;oon after reduc'd under the Subjection of the <HI>Mogols.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Decan</HI> belong'd formerly to a peculiar King; but is at pre&s;ent Govern'd by one of the <HI>Great Mogol</HI>'s Vice-Roys.</P>
<P>The <HI>Great Mogol Akebar,</HI> or <HI>Ecbar,</HI> was the fir&s;t which conquer'd the Kingdom or Country of <HI>De|can.</HI> He &s;ent his Son, <HI>Sultan Morad, Anno</HI> 1595. again&s;t <HI>Melik Amber,</HI> Vice-Roy of <HI>Decan,</HI> to whom belong'd formerly the City of <HI>Chaul,</HI> who &s;etting forth from <HI>Cambaye,</HI> as being the neare&s;t Place to this Province, was kill'd, with many of his Offi|cers. After this, in the Year 1598. he &s;ent one of his younge&s;t Sons to maintain the Wars again&s;t <HI>Melik,</HI> and revenge the Death of <HI>Sultan Morad:</HI> And &s;oon after he follow'd in his own Per&s;on, re|&s;olving to be pre&s;ent at the Conque&s;t; but he &s;taid about a Year in the City of <HI>Agra,</HI> from whence he march'd, <HI>Anno</HI> 1600. to the Kingdom of <HI>Decan:</HI> But the Queen of <HI>Decan,</HI> who Reign'd at that time, being a Woman of great Spirit and Valour, and being al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e,</HI> and &s;ome great Lords, oppos'd him with &s;o much Courage and Re&s;olution, that many of his People were &s;lain at their entrance into the King|dom of <HI>Barara,</HI> at a Pa&s;s near the Mountains, by which they were to come into the Country of <HI>De|can:</HI> Yet neverthele&s;s the <HI>Decanyns,</HI> after the death of this Prince&s;s, divided them&s;elves into divers Parties, from which proceeded their overthrow and total &s;ubduction; for &s;ome being corrupted by Money, and others by Promi&s;es, they all, upon hopes of greater Employments, contributed their A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> in his Conque&s;t of the Kingdom of <HI>Decan.</HI> Having by this means at la&s;t added this Kingdom to his Territories, he ele|cted one of his Sons to be his Vice-Roy, leaving with him a con&s;iderable Garri&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Texeira</HI> &s;ays the King of <HI>Decan</HI> was formerly by the Inhabitants call'd <HI>Nezal al Malucho,</HI> that is, <HI>The Lance or Spear of the Kingdom,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>Ma|lek,</HI> or <HI>Melik,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>King. Della Valle</HI> af|firms that the right Name of the Kings of <HI>Decan</HI> is <HI>Nizam Sciah,</HI> which &s;ome tran&s;late <HI>King of the Spear,</HI> induc'd thereunto by the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Word <HI>Nize,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>A Spear;</HI> but fal&s;ly, becau&s;e the King calls him&s;elf <HI>Nizam Sciah,</HI> and not <HI>Nize Sciah,</HI> as this explanation requires. Others call him, according to the &s;ignification of the Word <HI>Nizam, King of Falcons;</HI> for <HI>Nizam</HI> in the <HI>Indian</HI> Tongue &s;ignifies <HI>A Falcon, or other Bird of Prey;</HI> becau&s;e this King, before he was made a Gover|nor, was perhaps Falconer to that Great King un|der who&s;e Juri&s;diction all this Country was; &s;o that he retains that Name to this day.</P>
<P>The King which Reign'd <HI>Anno</HI> 1623. being a Child of about twelve Years of age, gave the Government of his Realm to one of his Slaves, call'd <HI>Melik Amber,</HI> by Extract an <HI>Amba&s;&s;ine,</HI> and of the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion, who Govern'd with &s;o much Policy, that this Country was more known by the Name of <HI>The Dominion of Melik,</HI> than that of the Kingdom of <HI>Nizam Sciah.</HI> He Govern'd with great Fidelity, and Obedience to the King, and not as &s;ome pretended, like a Ty|rant: Neither did he keep the King as a Pri&s;oner, though it is &s;aid by &s;ome that he de&s;ign'd to mar|ry his Daughter to the young King, that &s;o he might the better hold his Governor-&s;hip, and make his Heir his Succe&s;&s;or. He was a Man of great Prudence and Under&s;tanding, yet not with|out the Name of being very wicked, and incli|ning to Sorcery, of which &s;ome affirm he made u&s;e to continue him&s;elf in his Princes Favor. It is al&s;o &s;aid, That for the accompli&s;hing his De|&s;igns he would offer to the Devil &s;everal hun|dreds of Children that were his Slaves, with abundance of other People, hoping thereby the more ea&s;ily to obtain his De&s;ires. The&s;e and other &s;uch barbarous Wickedne&s;&s;es and Impieties have been reported of him.</P>
<P>This <HI>Melik Amber</HI> maintain'd at that time great Wars again&s;t the <HI>Mogols,</HI> not &s;paring his own Per&s;on, but him&s;elf engaging often very valiantly.</P>
<P>It is reported, That this King had a Gun of &s;uch a prodigious bigne&s;s, that it requir'd fifteen hundred Pounds of Gunpowder to Charge it; that a Man may &s;tand upright in the &s;ame; that it is above two Spans thick; and that it cannot be remov'd without many thou&s;ands of Oxen, be&s;ides Elephants: And though it is not us'd in

<P>THE Kingdom of <HI>Cuncan</HI> is by <HI>Lin&s;chot</HI> call'd <HI>The Kingdom of Dialcan;</HI> and by others, from <HI>Vi&s;iapour</HI> its Metropolis, <HI>The Kingdom of Vi&s;iapour;</HI> and by <HI>Della Valle, The Country of Telengone,</HI> or <HI>Telanga.</HI> It takes its be|ginning on the Sea-&s;hore of <HI>Ingediva,</HI> or <HI>Angedive,</HI> twelve Leagues Southward from <HI>Goa;</HI> or, accord|ing to <HI>John de Barros,</HI> from the River <HI>Aliga</HI> in <HI>Sintacora,</HI> which is a Boundary between <HI>Cuncan</HI> and the Country of <HI>Canara,</HI> and extends Northwardly to the Land of <HI>Decan,</HI> or the Land of <HI>Siffardan,</HI> a Tract of &s;ixty Leagues: We&s;tward it runs to the Sea, and Ea&s;tward to the Mountains of <HI>Gate,</HI> or to the Kingdom of <HI>Bagenael,</HI> or <HI>Golconda;</HI> and is by a Stream &s;eparated from the I&s;land <HI>Goa.

On the Mountains are &s;everal decay'd Fortre&s;&s;es, and an ancient Ca&s;tle, but without any Guns or Gar|ri&s;on. On the Northern Point, where the Bay begins, &s;tands a little Wood, which at a di&s;tance appears like a Fort; and below this Wood, near the Water, is a white Temple, or <HI>Pagode;</HI> as al&s;o another on the South Point, on the declining of the Mountain, be&s;ides &s;everal other Temples and &s;tately Edifices. This City was taken from the King of <HI>Idalcan,</HI> by the <HI>Portugue&s;e, Anno</HI> 1508. but was afterwards won from them again, and ruin'd by the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>Two Leagues Southward from <HI>Dabul</HI> lies a Pro|montory or Cape by the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> call'd <HI>Dabul Fal&s;o,</HI> that is, <HI>Fal&s;e Dabul,</HI> becau&s;e in &s;ailing by the &s;ame they often find them&s;elves deceiv'd, ta|king it for the Point of <HI>Dabul,</HI> which it very much re&s;embles. Beyond this Cape is a Bay by them call'd <HI>Enceada de los Brahmannes,</HI> that is, <HI>The Bay of the Brahmines,</HI> becau&s;e many <HI>Brahmines</HI> dwell thereabouts. Beyond this is the <HI>Ragiaputa,</HI> and

<P>Four Leagues from <HI>Dabul</HI> lieth the Bay of <HI>Zan|guizara,</HI> in 17 Degrees and a half of Northern Latitude. Twelve Leagues from <HI>Zanguizara,</HI> or rather from <HI>Dabul,</HI> and twenty from <HI>Goa,</HI> lies the Haven and Road of <HI>Ceitapour,</HI> in 17 Degrees and 20 Minutes Northern Latitude, behind an I&s;land which &s;ecures it from all Winds. This Haven hath at the lowe&s;t but three, and at the highe&s;t not above &s;ix or &s;even Fathom Water. Beyond the River, three Leagues from this I&s;land and the Road <HI>Ceitagour,</HI> lies the City <HI>Ra&s;apour,</HI> one of the eminente&s;t Towns of the Kingdom of <HI>Cuncan</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;iapour.</HI></P>
<P>Travelling from the Sea-&s;ide about <HI>Goa,</HI> up into the Country, to the Metropolis <HI>Vi&s;iapour,</HI> you pa&s;s by and through the following Cities and Villages. Fir&s;t, A great City call'd <HI>Ditcauly,</HI> lying three <HI>Kos</HI> from <HI>Goa.</HI> Not far from thence, near the River <HI>Madre de Dios,</HI> lies a Ca&s;tle call'd <HI>Ponda. Banda,</HI> a mighty City, is about one <HI>Gau,</HI> or three Leagues from <HI>Ditcauly,</HI> two from <HI>Goa,</HI> two from <HI>Wingerla,</HI> and three and a half, or nine Leagues from <HI>Balla|gate.</HI> It is built near the River <HI>Dery,</HI> which glides by this City into the Sea, having broad Streets, with many fair Buildings, and &s;everal <HI>Pagodes</HI> or Temples.</P>
<P>Between <HI>Banda</HI> and the <HI>Ballagatean</HI> Mountains lie &s;everal Villages; as <HI>Amby,</HI> two <HI>Kos</HI> from <HI>Ban|da;</HI> and <HI>Herpoli,</HI> four <HI>Kos:</HI> Eleven <HI>Kos</HI> from thence, on the other &s;ide, at the Foot of the lowe&s;t of the <HI>Ballagatean</HI> Mountains, is the Village <HI>Amboly,</HI> be|yond which, near the River <HI>Hereneca&s;&s;y,,</HI> is ano|ther Village of the &s;ame Name. A Cannon-&s;hot from <HI>Hereneca&s;&s;y,</HI> in the Valley between the Moun|tains of <HI>Ballagate,</HI> is a Dorp call'd <HI>Berouly;</HI> and two <HI>Kos</HI> further, another call'd <HI>We&s;eree&punc;</HI> three <HI>Kos</HI> further, <HI>Outor;</HI> &s;ix and a half more, <HI>Berapour;</HI> half a <HI>Kos</HI> beyond, <HI>Matoura;</HI> and one more, the plea&s;ant Village <HI>Calingra,</HI> clo&s;e planted about with Trees. A Cannon-&s;hot from <HI>Calingra</HI> is the Village <HI>Cangier,</HI> a little beyond a place by a general Name call'd <HI>Bary;</HI> for all tho&s;e Places which have no peculiar Name, but belong to other Villages, are in general call'd <HI>Bary.</HI> One <HI>Kos</HI> from hence lies the Village <HI>Worry;</HI> and two and a half further, another call'd <HI>Attrowaad,</HI> adorn'd with a <HI>Pagode</HI> built on a Mountain, which may be &s;een at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. Two <HI>Kos</HI> and a half fur|ther lies the Village <HI>Badaraly;</HI> and as much be|yond that, the Dorp <HI>Kerwes;</HI> two <HI>Kos</HI> more from which is <HI>Secoery:</HI> Five <HI>Kos</HI> from hence is a <HI>Pagode,</HI> from whence you may plainly &s;ee the City <HI>Mir&s;ie,</HI> with its Ca&s;tles and Towers. Seven <HI>Kos</HI> from the Village <HI>Secoery</HI> lies <HI>Raiabaeg,</HI> a pretty large and Trading In-land City, fortified with a Ca&s;tle, and belonging properly to the King's Con&s;ort: About one <HI>Kos</HI> from the City is a fair Well, and two <HI>Kos</HI> further runs the River <HI>Gagni.</HI> Three <HI>Kos</HI> and a half from this City of <HI>Raiabaag,</HI> is another City call'd <HI>Gotterny,</HI> which hath a Fortification at one of its Gates. A Cannon-&s;hot from thence are two Villages, call'd <HI>Coete&s;y</HI> and <HI>Omgar;</HI> and half a <HI>Kos</HI> further, the eminent River <HI>Cor&s;tena;</HI> one <HI>Kos</HI> and a half from which is the Village <HI>Eynatour;</HI> beyond that, the Dorp <HI>Caterna;</HI> and one <HI>Kos</HI> and a half further, the River <HI>Agery,</HI> with the Villages <HI>Tangely</HI> and <HI>Erary.</HI> Three <HI>Kos</HI> from <HI>Erary</HI> is the City <HI>Atteny;</HI> and one <HI>Kos</HI> beyond, the City <HI>Bard|gie;</HI> from whence to <HI>Agger</HI> is three <HI>Kos</HI> and a half more; three <HI>Kos</HI> thence to the City <HI>Tal&s;enge;</HI> and as much from thence to <HI>Hamowaere: Tickocata</HI> lies three <HI>Kos</HI> further, and about &s;ix from <HI>Vi&s;iapour,</HI> having <HI>Noura&s;pour</HI> and <HI>Sirrapour</HI> between both.</P>
<P><HI>Tickocata</HI> is an In-land City, provided with a large <HI>Sarry</HI> or Publick Inn for Travellers.</P>
<P>The Kingdom of <HI>Cuncan</HI> is water'd by &s;everal Rivers: <HI>viz.</HI> A little to the Northward of <HI>Goa</HI> is the River <HI>Madre Dios;</HI> and beyond the City <HI>Banda</HI> the River <HI>Dery</HI> falls into the Sea, and is Na|vigable in &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els. Two <HI>Kos</HI> from the Ci|ty <HI>Kaiabaag</HI> glides the River <HI>Cor&s;tena,</HI> which pa&s;&s;es through the whole Country of <HI>Cuncan,</HI> to the Ju|ri&s;diction of <HI>Ma&s;ilipatan;</HI> about three <HI>Kos</HI> from whence, the Stream <HI>Agry</HI> hath its Cour&s;e. Be|tween the two Towns <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Little Graeen</HI> runs a large River call'd <HI>Coecenna,</HI> on who&s;e Banks tho&s;e Towns are &s;ituate. The River <HI>Coyna,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>Great Water,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing through the Village <HI>Helewaek,</HI> hath its Original near the City <HI>Chaury,</HI> lying twelve <HI>Gau,</HI> or thirty &s;ix Leagues up into the Country, and extends it &s;elf in &s;everal Branches beyond the Metropolis <HI>Vi&s;iapour,</HI> and the whole Kingdom of <HI>Cuncan.</HI> The River <HI>Ghayhkeer</HI> di&s;|charges its Water into the River <HI>Helewacko,</HI> who&s;e Shore is border'd by many Dorps, and planted with <HI>Cocos</HI> and other Trees, very delightful to the Spectators. This River hath its ri&s;e out of the Mountains of <HI>Ballagata,</HI> and po&s;&s;es by the City <HI>Eabul</HI> into the <HI>Indian</HI> Sea, where it makes a con|venient Bay. From the North to the South Point, cro&s;s this Bay, is a Bank, which at low Water is quite dry; &s;o that tho&s;e which &s;ail up the River to the City, mu&s;t pa&s;s along clo&s;e by the South Point. At the entrance is commonly five or &s;ix Fathom Water at low Tide. Four Leagues to the Southward of <HI>Dabul,</HI> and thirty to the Northward of <HI>Goa,</HI> glides the River <HI>Zangui|zar,</HI> by <HI>Barbo&s;a</HI> call'd <HI>Cinguicar:</HI> Its entrance into the Sea is in 17 Degrees and 13 Minutes Nor|thern Latitude, and makes a large Bay or In-let, with &s;everal commodious Roads for Shipping. Next is the River <HI>Bardes,</HI> which runs by a Town call'd <HI>Banda.</HI> The Stream <HI>Aliga</HI> of <HI>Sintacora,</HI> which ri&s;es in the Mountains of <HI>Gate,</HI> from thence taking its Cour&s;e to the We&s;tward, falls into the Sea oppo&s;ite to the I&s;land <HI>Anchedive,</HI> in 14 De|grees and a half of Northern Latitude.</P>
<P>The many Rivers and Brooks which flow through this Country of <HI>Cuncan,</HI> make the &s;ame very fruitful, e&s;pecially in the production of Rice, which is &s;ow'd in &s;uch Grounds as lie low, and are overflow'd in the Winter: Yet it produces but little Corn; but abundance of <HI>Areka</HI> and <HI>Be|tel,</HI> e&s;pecially on the Banks of the River <HI>Betel.</HI></P>
<P>The Fruit <HI>Mangas</HI> growing in <HI>Ballagate</HI> are high|ly e&s;teem'd, weighing about two Pound a spiece, and are of a much plea&s;anter ta&s;te than tho&s;e which grow in <HI>Charanna, Quindor, Mandanagor,</HI> and <HI>Dulta|bado,</HI> and e&s;pecially tho&s;e of <HI>Ni&s;amoxa.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ballagate</HI> and <HI>Decan</HI> produce al&s;o abundance of Grapes, but inferior to tho&s;e of <HI>Spain;</HI> and al&s;o great Quantities of Cotton and Silk.</P>
<P>There are likewi&s;e divers &s;orts of Stones found in <HI>Ballagate;</HI> as Amethy&s;ts, Chry&s;olites, and He|mathites, or Blood-&s;tones; and by <HI>Decan,</HI> beyond <HI>Ballagate,</HI> very rich Diamonds are found on the Mountain which the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> call <HI>Rocca Velha,</HI> that is, <HI>The Old Rock.</HI> Some of the&s;e Precious Stones, which are cut naturally, are in the Country Language call'd <HI>Naiffez,</HI> and are by the <HI>Indians</HI> e&s;teem'd above all others.</P>
<PB N="249" REF="178">
<P>By <HI>U&s;tabado</HI> is a certain Stone found by the <HI>Ara|bians,</HI> call'd <HI>Hageramini,</HI> and by the <HI>Portugue&s;e Pe|dra Armenia,</HI> that is, <HI>The Armenian Stone;</HI> becau&s;e the &s;ame &s;ort, being of a bluei&s;h green, are found in <HI>Armenia.</HI> The <HI>Moors</HI> make u&s;e of them in their Sickne&s;s to provoke Urine.</P>
<P>About the Countries of <HI>Ballagate</HI> is a &s;ort of ex|cellent Varni&s;h: Here are al&s;o many Tygers, and Serpents of a prodigious length and bigne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Natives of <HI>Decan</HI> and <HI>Cuncan</HI> are either <HI>Decangeans</HI> or <HI>Cuncanyns,</HI> and corruptly by the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> call'd <HI>Canaryns</HI> and <HI>Corumbyns;</HI> but be|&s;ides, there are <HI>Moors, Per&s;ians, Benjans,</HI> and other <HI>Heathen</HI> People, which far exceed the Natives in Number.</P>
<P><HI>Lin&s;chot</HI> tells us, That the Inhabitants both in Complexion, Con&s;titution, and Clothes, do very much re&s;emble tho&s;e of <HI>Zurratte,</HI> and the <HI>Benjans:</HI> But <HI>Barbo&s;a</HI> makes them Black, and <HI>Barthema</HI> Sal|low, or Swarthy. They are naturally Valiant, being for the mo&s;t part extracted from Strangers; excellent Hor&s;e-men, and well skill'd in managing of Elephants: but they are very proud, in&s;olent, and &s;elf-conceited. Their Women are much en|clin'd to Venery.</P>
<P>Their Clothes are either of Silk or Cotton, ex|cept their Shoes, which are open at the Toes, and lac'd over their bare Feet on the top: yet <HI>Pyrard</HI> &s;aith, That they are Red, &s;harp-toe'd, gilt, and open on the top. The Women walk with their Faces veil'd, and the Children &s;tark naked, till their &s;eventh or eighth Year. They eat all things without di&s;tinction, except Cows, Hogs, and Buffaloes; which Bea&s;ts according to an ancient Cu&s;tom of the <HI>Brahmines</HI> are accounted Holy; nay, they are &s;o &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly grounded in this belief, that they &s;leep a nights under the&s;e Bea&s;ts, and catch their Dung in their Hands, imagining that thereby they do their Gods great Service. They al&s;o ab&s;tain from all &s;orts of Fi&s;h. Mo&s;t of their Hou&s;es are built of Straw, with &s;uch lit|tle Doors, that they are forc'd to creep in and out. Their Furniture is incon&s;iderable; for a Mat &s;pread on the Ground &s;erves them in &s;tead of a Bed; and a Hole digg'd in the Earth, for a Mortar to &s;tamp their Rice in.</P>
<P>There are many Gold and Silver-&s;miths among them, and al&s;o very good Arti&s;ts in the working of other Minerals, be&s;ides many other Handicrafts and Trade&s;men, Phy&s;icians, Chirurgeons, Car|penters, Ma&s;ons, and the like. Every Child is taught the Trade or Calling of his Parents.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;ticks maintain them&s;elves with &s;owing of Rice and Fi&s;hing, on which they live very poorly, inhabiting near the Sea-&s;hore, and the Banks of Rivers, for the convenience of the <HI>Coco</HI>-Trees which grow along the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The <HI>Decanders</HI> which dwell near the River <HI>Zanguizara</HI> maintain them&s;elves with Tillage and keeping of Cattel. People of more Ability Traf|fick in Pepper, in which the chiefe&s;t Trade of this Country con&s;i&s;ts, which coming out of <HI>Canara,</HI> is &s;ent by Sea to <HI>Per&s;ia, Suratte,</HI> and <HI>Europe.</HI> They deal likewi&s;e in all &s;orts of Provi&s;ions; for this Country is the Store-hou&s;e for all its Neighbors. The Inhabitants al&s;o drive a great Trade in Ca|lico, and another &s;ort of Cloth call'd <HI>Beirames,</HI> which being brought by Land from <HI>Indo&s;tan, Gol|conda,</HI> and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Choromandel,</HI> is &s;old to great advantage; for in mo&s;t Towns are kept Weekly Markets, to which the Merchants carry all their Commodities, but e&s;pecially Corn and Provi&s;ions, which are generally bought up by a valiant &s;ort of People call'd <HI>Vene&s;ars,</HI> and tran&s;|ported through the whole Country of <HI>Indo&s;tan,</HI> which they penetrate with <HI>Cafilas</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of three, four, nay &s;ometimes eight or ten thou&s;and Bea&s;ts of Burthen, accompanied with Women and Children, which follow them like an Army.</P>
<P>In <HI>Vi&s;iapour</HI> dwell many Jewellers, which Trade in Diamonds that come from <HI>Golconda,</HI> and Pearls of a great value. There is al&s;o a great Market wherein nothing but Diamonds are &s;old, which are bought by the <HI>Benjans</HI> of <HI>Surratte</HI> and <HI>Cambaye,</HI> and by them di&s;pos'd of again at <HI>Goa</HI> and other Places. Out of this Country is al&s;o carried great &s;tore of <HI>Betel,</HI> to <HI>Ormus, Aden,</HI> and <HI>Cambaye.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> of <HI>Goa</HI> drive a great Trade with the Inhabitants of <HI>Cuncan,</HI> but chiefly with the Merchants of <HI>Ditcauly</HI> and <HI>Banda.</HI></P>
<P>In the City of <HI>Raiebaag</HI> dwell many eminent Dealers, which Trade in Pepper and other Com|modities.</P>
<P>The Coins and Current Moneys of <HI>Cuncan</HI> are of different Valuations, there being two &s;orts, <HI>viz. Laryns</HI> and <HI>Pagods.</HI> A <HI>Laryn</HI> of <HI>Dabul,</HI> coyn'd of the ordinary Metal, is valued at ten <HI>Pagods;</HI> whereas tho&s;e of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> make but eight. More|over the <HI>Pagods</HI> are likewi&s;e of a different Value; for &s;ome are worth &s;even and a half or eight <HI>Per|&s;ian Laryns,</HI> and ten In-land. Their &s;mall Money is of Copper, and is call'd <HI>Ba&s;arucus</HI> and <HI>Pay&s;as;</HI> two hundred and ten <HI>Ba&s;arucus,</HI> and in &s;ome Places a hundred and eighty, make a <HI>Laryn;</HI> and twenty eight <HI>Pay&s;as</HI> are of the &s;ame value.</P>
<P>Every Town and Village hath for the mo&s;t part a peculiar Coin and Value on their Money, in which is great deceit, e&s;pecially in <HI>Laryns</HI> and <HI>Pagods,</HI> which the &s;ubtle <HI>Benjans</HI> make &s;o artifici|ally of Copper and other Metals, that they can|not be di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the good: Wherefore few will receive Money without the pre&s;ence of a <HI>Xaraf</HI> or Exchanger, who for a &s;mall Reward looks over all the Money, and makes good the Damage, if there happens to be any bad Money among that which he receives: And if it be found that an Exchanger &s;o entru&s;ted as is before-menti|on'd, &s;hall de&s;ignedly put away bad Money, he is immediately condemn'd to have his Hands cut off, and all his E&s;tate forfeited to the King; notwith|&s;tanding which, they practice it daily.</P>
<P>The Weight of this Country is like that of <HI>Surrat,</HI> having onely &s;ome &s;mall difference; for twenty &s;even <HI>Maons</HI> of <HI>Cuncan</HI> make but twenty <HI>Maons</HI> of <HI>Surrat.</HI> The ordinary <HI>Maon</HI> of forty <HI>Ceeres</HI> (a <HI>Ceer</HI> is &s;ixty <HI>Pey&s;&s;es</HI>) is about twenty &s;e|ven <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pounds, with which Weight they weigh all heavy Goods; and with another Weight call'd <HI>Goemy</HI> (each <HI>Goemy</HI> being twelve <HI>Maons</HI>) they weigh their Pepper. A <HI>Quintal,</HI> which is al&s;o a common Weight, makes four <HI>Maons;</HI> and five <HI>Quintals,</HI> or twenty <HI>Maons,</HI> one <HI>Candy,</HI> which is five hundred and forty <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pound weight.</P>
<P>There are many other Coins and Weights in u&s;e among them, which every Per&s;on in buying or &s;elling of Goods agree upon at their plea&s;ure; but the&s;e before-mention'd are the mo&s;t common, and generally us'd through all the Country.</P>
<P>The Arms which the Inhabitants of <HI>Decan</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;iapour</HI> u&s;e, both for Hor&s;e and Foot, are broad Swords, Pikes, Lances, with a &s;quare Iron at the end about a Span long, Bows and Arrows, Shields, Darts, which they throw with great dexterity at their Enemies: Their Defen&s;ive Arms are Coats
<PB N="250" REF="179">of Mail, and Coats lin'd with Cotton, which they call <HI>Landa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hes.</HI> When they march into the Field, they carry with them Tents of Callico, under which they &s;leep. They make u&s;e of Oxen to carry their Baggage. Their common way of Fighting is on Foot, though when they march, &s;ome walk, others ride on Hor&s;es, and &s;ome on Elephants, of which the King keeps a great num|ber for that purpo&s;e. The King of <HI>Cuncan</HI> is &s;aid to be very powerful, and able in a &s;hort time to bring eighty thou&s;and, or as &s;ome &s;ay, two hun|dred thou&s;and armed Men into the Field, both Hor&s;e and Foot: He keeps many <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Mogols</HI> con&s;tantly in his Service, which commonly enjoy the mo&s;t eminent Places under him: He likewi&s;e maintains many valiant <HI>Ra&s;epouts.</HI> There are four very eminent Ca&s;tles or Fortre&s;&s;es in <HI>Cun|can,</HI> known by the Names of <HI>Ponda, Perinda, Sal|poure,</HI> and <HI>Bellegam Chapour.</HI></P>
<P>The King hath divers great Guns in his Maga|zen, and about two hundred Cannons, Demi-Cannons, and Culverins. Round about the City and Ca&s;tle-walls of <HI>Vi&s;iapour</HI> are planted many &s;mall Pieces, as Drakes, and the like.</P>
<P>In the City of <HI>Vi&s;iapour</HI> is a Copper Gun of an incredible bigne&s;s, its Chamber being large enough to contain above five hundred Pound of Powder: It was found in a conquer'd Ca&s;tle call'd <HI>Perando,</HI> from whence it was convey'd to <HI>Vi&s;iapour</HI> by ten Elephants, fourteen hundred Oxen, and an incre|dible number of Men. The Founder of this Piece is reported to have been a <HI>Roman,</HI> who un|dertook the &s;ame to make his Name Immortal, and that his Work might be admir'd by the whole World; which is the more talk'd of, becau&s;e after he had fini&s;h'd this prodigious Piece, he kill'd his own Son, and &s;prinkled his Blood over it for an Offering. It hapned al&s;o, that whil&s;t this Gun was Ca&s;ting, <HI>Braman</HI> the King's Trea&s;urer coming to demand an Account of the Charge from the &s;aid <HI>Roman,</HI> he caus'd a Fire to be made in the Pit wherein the &s;aid Gun was Ca&s;t, and throwing the &s;aid <HI>Braman</HI> into it, bid him take an Account of the Fire which con&s;um'd the Silver and Copper. The News carried to the King by the Relations of the Decea&s;ed, he &s;eem'd not at all concern'd there|at, but rather di&s;pleas'd with the Complainants, telling them he never gave his Trea&s;urer any Or|der to demand an Account.</P>
<P>With this Cannon the King took an almo&s;t in|vincible Ca&s;tle call'd <HI>Salapoure,</HI> making a Breach in the Wall at the fir&s;t Shot of fifteen Ells long, and at the next, batter'd down the whole &s;ide of the Wall; which &s;o amaz'd the Be&s;ieged, that without any further re&s;i&s;tance they &s;urrendred the Ca&s;tle. The Inhabitants relate many &s;trange and ridiculous things of this Gun, as that it for|merly Prophe&s;ied like the Oracle at <HI>Delphos.</HI></P>
<P>They &s;peak three &s;orts of Languages, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Arabian, Per&s;ian,</HI> and the peculiar Language of the Country, which differs from that of the other Provinces.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Decan, Cuncan,</HI> and <HI>Gol|conda</HI> &s;peak the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Tongue, which at the Princes Courts is as common as their own Lan|guage.</P>
<P>They Betroth their Children at &s;even or eight Years of Age, and Marry them at twelve. They keep a continu'd Fea&s;t for fourteen days before the Wedding, concluding each day with the &s;ound of Drums and Trumpets. On the Wedding-day all the Relations walk &s;even times about a Fire made for that purpo&s;e, after which they hold the Mar|riage confirm'd. The Bride brings nothing to her Husband, &s;ave onely her Per&s;on, and a few Jewels of an incon&s;iderable value.</P>
<P>They always burn the Bodies of the Decea&s;|ed; and if a Married Man dies, the Widow is oblig'd either to ca&s;t her &s;elf into the Fire with the Corps of her dead Husband, or to live the re&s;t of her days in infamy and di&s;grace.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Cuncan</HI> is in the Country Lan|guage entituled <HI>Adelcan,</HI> that is, <HI>The true Gover|nor;</HI> or <HI>Adel Scach,</HI> that is, <HI>Real Lord,</HI> or <HI>Lord of Ju&s;tice:</HI> and by the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> corruptly, <HI>Dial|cam,</HI> or <HI>Hialcam;</HI> by the <HI>Netherlanders, Adelchia;</HI> by others, <HI>Cadum Schach,</HI> or <HI>Schach Gean:</HI> He is al&s;o call'd <HI>Sabay,</HI> that is, <HI>Lord.

<P>The King of <HI>Vi&s;iapour</HI> maintains al&s;o Wars again&s;t &s;ome of his <HI>Rais</HI> or <HI>Rajas,</HI> which are <HI>Hea|then</HI> Princes, or petty Kings, which with the <HI>Ra|butes</HI> their Subjects re&s;ide in the Mountains of <HI>Bal|lagate,</HI> in Places naturally inacce&s;&s;ible, where they neither fear being &s;urpriz'd nor be&s;ieg'd.</P>
<P>They have no Written Laws in the whole Realm; but the King's Will is a Law to all his Subjects. All Civil Debates that happen to ari&s;e in the City <HI>Vi&s;iapour,</HI> are determin'd by the <HI>Coutewael</HI> or High-Sheriff; but Criminal Cau&s;es are try'd by the King him&s;elf.

<P>In other Towns or Provinces the Vice-Roy or Governor pa&s;&s;es Sentence after the &s;ame man|ner: For by vertue of their Patents, which they call <HI>Firman,</HI> they are particularly impower'd to give Judgment again&s;t Criminals.

Such Per&s;ons as are forc'd to &s;wear, are plac'd in a round Circle made upon the Ground, laying one Hand upon &s;ome A&s;hes brought thither for that purpo&s;e, and the other on their Brea&s;t, and uttering &s;everal Expre&s;|&s;ions to their Gods; after which, they think them|&s;elves oblig'd, on pain of Damnation, to make a true An&s;wer to all &s;uch Interrogatories as are put to them.</P>
<P><HI>Lin&s;chot</HI> makes the <HI>Idalcans,</HI> or Kings of <HI>Cun|can,</HI> to be Subjects and Tributaries to the King of <HI>Nar&s;inga;</HI> but <HI>Jarrick</HI> affirms them to be mortal Enemies.</P>
<P>The Kings of <HI>Cuncan</HI> were formerly ab&s;olute Lords of va&s;t Territories, and &s;ubject to none; but about &s;ixty Years ago, in the time of King <HI>Mamedh Idelxa,</HI> Son to King <HI>Ibrahimxa,</HI> who <HI>Anno</HI> 1635. po&s;&s;e&s;t the Crown, in the twenty fourth Year of his Age, they were reduc'd under the <HI>Mo|gol</HI>'s Juri&s;diction: <HI>viz.</HI> when in King <HI>Mamedh Idelxa</HI>'s Minority (who Govern'd his Realm un|der the Guardian&s;hip of <HI>Chavas Chan</HI>) the <HI>Great Mogol</HI> a&s;&s;aulting tho&s;e of <HI>Vi&s;iapour</HI> with two hun|dred thou&s;and Foot, and eighty thou&s;and Hor&s;e, for their refu&s;ing to pay him Tribute. After a long and bloody War, and the death of <HI>Chavas Chan,</HI> a Peace was concluded, Duke <HI>Mu&s;taff Chan</HI> and the Kings of <HI>Vi&s;iapour</HI> brought under &s;ubjecti|on to the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> with Conditions to pay nine thou&s;and <HI>Pagods</HI> yearly for Tribute. But at pre&s;ent, as <HI>F. Bernier</HI> affirms, the King of <HI>Vi&s;ia|pour</HI> pays no Tribute to the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> but de|fends him&s;elf again&s;t all Attempts which he makes upon him: for though he be not &s;o powerful as tho&s;e of <HI>Golconda</HI> oppo&s;e the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s Forces, yet he hath this advantage, by rea&s;on of the remotene&s;s of his Country from <HI>Dely</HI> and <HI>Agra,</HI> that the <HI>Mo|gol</HI> makes not &s;uch frequent Attempts on the&s;e Parts; be&s;ides which, that part of the Country of
<PB N="252" REF="180"><HI>Vi&s;iapour</HI> which lies next the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s is very diffi|cult for an Army to approach, becau&s;e of the &s;carcity of Water and Provi&s;ions, and the badne&s;s of the Ways. The Metropolis <HI>Vi&s;iapour</HI> is al&s;o very &s;trong, &s;ituate in a dry barren Soil, and guard|ed by many Fortre&s;&s;es, built on the circumjacent Mountains, which are mo&s;t of them inacce&s;&s;ible. Many <HI>Rajas</HI> al&s;o joyn with him for their own &s;ecu|rity. Moreover he oftentimes receives private a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> who always keeps an Army ready on the Borders, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the King of <HI>Vi&s;iapour,</HI> whenever he perceives him to be too much oppre&s;s'd by the <HI>Mogol.</HI> Yet never|thele&s;s this State, as al&s;o that of <HI>Golconda,</HI> is much declin'd; for the <HI>Mogol</HI> hath taken <HI>Paranda</HI> from them, which is the Key of their Country, with the Magnificent City <HI>Bider,</HI> and &s;ome other emi|nent Places: But e&s;pecially becau&s;e of a diffe|rence between the&s;e two Kings; for the la&s;t King of <HI>Vi&s;iapour</HI> dying without I&s;&s;ue-Male, the pre&s;ent King, who is a young Man, being brought up by the King of <HI>Golcondas</HI> Si&s;ter, who took him for her Son, doth not acknowledge her Favours.</P>
<P><HI>Ibrahim Adil Sciah,</HI> who Reign'd <HI>Anno</HI> 1620. notwith&s;tanding the Countries of <HI>Cutb Sciah</HI> or the King of <HI>Golconda,</HI> and <HI>Nizam Sciah</HI> King of <HI>De|can,</HI> lay as Bulwarks between his Dominions and the <HI>Mogol</HI>'s, and upon occa&s;ion was able to rai&s;e an Army of a hundred thou&s;and Men, &s;tood never|thele&s;s in great fear of the <HI>Mogol,</HI> to whom though he paid con&s;iderable Tributes yearly, yet he was &s;o &s;lighted by the <HI>Mogol,</HI> that he &s;ent his Letters to him by a Common Soldier, or Slave, whom he was forc'd to meet with his whole Army, and conduct him in great Pomp to his Court, where he plac'd him&s;elf in a Chair of State prepar'd purpo&s;ely for him, whil&s;t <HI>Adil Sciah</HI> was forc'd to &s;tand in his Pre&s;ence, like a Slave: And when the Me&s;&s;enger had laid the Letter on a Carpet, he bow'd down to the Ground three times, according to the manner of the Country, before he dur&s;t take it up.</P>
<P>This <HI>Ibrahim Adil Sciah</HI> is &s;aid to have caus'd his own Son to be put to death, for per&s;uading him from paying the u&s;ual Tribute to the <HI>Great Mogol,</HI> and coun&s;elling him by force to free him&s;elf from that Slavery.</P>
<P>The King now Reigning &s;ends oftentimes great Pre&s;ents to the <HI>Mogol. Anno</HI> 1656. in <HI>June,</HI> the King <HI>Sciah Sahep</HI> &s;ent a Pre&s;ent of &s;even <HI>Lak Penas,</HI> or Two hundred and eighty thou&s;and Pounds, to the <HI>Mogol</HI> Prince <HI>Oranchzef,</HI> (at pre&s;ent King) Re|&s;iding at <HI>Dautabake;</HI> who then accompanied with <HI>Mir&s;imula,</HI> lay with his Fathers Army on the Bor|ders of <HI>Vi&s;iapour,</HI> in a Province call'd <HI>Pretapapour.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Vena&s;&s;ars,</HI> and <HI>Collers</HI> or <HI>Coulys,</HI> as al&s;o the <HI>Rasboutes</HI> of <HI>Cambaye,</HI> pay Tribute to this King.</P>
<P>The thirteenth of <HI>November, Anno</HI> 1656. the King of <HI>Vi&s;iapour,</HI> call<HI>'d Adil Sciah,</HI> deceas'd; at which time <HI>Fettechan</HI> guarded the King's Palace; and <HI>Chan Channa</HI> coming with his whole Army near the Walls, de&s;ir'd to know of <HI>Fettechan</HI> whe|ther it would not be convenient for him to bring the Army into the City, to prevent In&s;urrections: Whereupon <HI>Fettechan</HI> reply'd, That he had taken upon him in <HI>Chan Channa</HI>'s ab&s;ence to Guard the Fort; and therefore he judg'd it be&s;t, for the &s;afety of the Realm, to let <HI>Chan Channa</HI> come into the City: Whereupon he repair'd to <HI>Fettechan</HI> in the Palace, where con&s;ulting together, they conclu|ded to Crown the King's adopted Son, call'd <HI>Cha Chade,</HI> which was perform'd the &s;ame day, he be|ing then in the twenty fourth Year of his Age. This new King receiv'd the Name of <HI>Aly Adel Sciah,</HI> and was permitted to u&s;e the King's Grand|fathers Seal. The right Coronation of their Kings is perform'd at <HI>Chirer Ridder,</HI> a principal Place in the Realm of <HI>Vi&s;iapour.</HI></P>
<P>When the old King lay a dying, <HI>Chan Channa</HI> was &s;ent for to him by the Queen, who being come, the Queen told the King, <HI>Here is</HI> Chan Channa; but &s;he receiv'd no An&s;wer. Soon after, <HI>Fettechan</HI> being al&s;o call'd thither, the Queen &s;poke to the King, &s;aying, <HI>The Lord</HI> Fettechan <HI>is al&s;o here pre&s;ent;</HI> but the King not an&s;wering, lift up his Eyes and departed this life: which when <HI>Fettechan</HI> perceiv'd, he threw him&s;elf after many mournful Expre&s;&s;ions on the Ground, and &s;hew'd great &s;igns of &s;orrow.</P>
<P>The young King was committed to the Care and Government of <HI>Chan Channa,</HI> being the &s;econd Per&s;on in the Realm; whil&s;t <HI>Fettechan</HI> &s;orrowful|ly repair'd to his Hou&s;e, where he mourn'd eight days for the King's death, no Man being able in that time to per&s;wade him to come to Court, not|with&s;tanding the new King had &s;everal times in|vited him: But at la&s;t <HI>Chan Channa</HI> &s;ent him word, <HI>That it was then no time to mourn the King's death any longer; That there was a nece&s;&s;ity for him to make his appearance before the new King; which if he again re|fus'd to do, he &s;hould be nece&s;&s;itated him&s;elf to fetch him, and to bring him before his Maje&s;ty.</HI> Upon which Me&s;&s;age <HI>Fettechan</HI> made his appearance be|fore the King, and in all humility fell down at his Feet, but was immediately taken up and embrac'd by the new-Crown'd Prince. The Queen &s;itting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll this while &s;ilent behind a Curtain, at la&s;t &s;poke thus to <HI>Fettechan: Why would you ob&s;cure your &s;elf in this juncture of time, when your Pre&s;ence is &s;o much requir'd in all Bu&s;ine&s;s? 'Tis true, here wants no Coun&s;el; but we cannot in the&s;e dangerous times repo&s;e any Confidence in them.</HI> Whereupon the young King added, <HI>You mu&s;t bani&s;h the death of his decea&s;ed Maje|&s;ty out of your mind; I intend to promote you higher, and be&s;tow more Honor upon you than hitherto you have enjoy'd.</HI> Immediately after he gave him the Cane whereby he held his former Offices; which <HI>Fette|chan</HI> humbly receiving, was pre&s;ented by the King, as a Te&s;timony of his Favor, with eight thou&s;and <HI>Penas,</HI> which he mode&s;tly refus'd, &s;aying, That it was cu&s;tomary the Pre&s;ent &s;hould be made to <HI>Chan Channa.</HI></P>
<P>Among &s;everal other Per&s;ons of Quality, the Lord <HI>Abdullachan</HI> came to Complement the King with a Pre&s;ent of nine thou&s;and <HI>Penas,</HI> and to wi&s;h him a long and pro&s;perous Reign: But the King would not accept his Pre&s;ent, telling him, That in &s;tead thereof, he &s;hould encrea&s;e the number of his Hor&s;e. The King likewi&s;e commanded all Officers that were unde his Subjection to appear at Court, charging them on forfeiture of a hundred thou&s;and <HI>Penas</HI> con&s;tantly to maintain a thou&s;and Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>The Inhabitants were at this time in a great Con&s;ternation, fearing to be &s;urpriz'd by the <HI>Mogol</HI> Prince <HI>Oranchzef:</HI> But the King cau&s;ing an Edict to be publi&s;h'd, commanded them to be at quiet, and encourag'd them with the hopes he had to lie down in a &s;hort time with his Army before <HI>Agra.</HI></P>
<P>The King profe&s;&s;es the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion, as al&s;o the greate&s;t part of his Subjects; the re&s;t are <HI>Pagans</HI> and <HI>Idolaters,</HI> of which Opinion are the <HI>Canaryns</HI> of <HI>Goa,</HI> the <HI>Naires,</HI> and other <HI>Indians.</HI>

<P>The King allows the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> great Privi|leges, which are confirm'd to them by a Letter dated the tenth of <HI>May,</HI> 1655. <HI>viz.</HI> That they may lawfully claim as their proper Goods all &s;uch Commodities or Things what&s;oever as &s;hall hap|pen to be Stranded, coming out of any of their Ships ca&s;t away upon his Coa&s;t: And they are likewi&s;e freed from all manner of Taxes and Im|po&s;itions, as will appear more at large from the following <HI>Firman</HI> or Letter, written to the Lord General <HI>John Maetzuiker.</HI></P>
