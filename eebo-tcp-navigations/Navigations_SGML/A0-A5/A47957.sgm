<HEAD>THE PESENT STATE OF <HI>GENEVA,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>GENEVA,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Antiquity.</NOTE> as appears by &s;ome Chronicles of the Country of <HI>Vaux,</HI> is one of the anciente&s;t Cities of <HI>Europe,</HI> being commonly &s;up|po&s;ed to have been built by <HI>Lemanus,</HI> Son of <HI>Hercules,</HI> the great King of the <HI>Gaules,</HI> who gave the name like|wi&s;e to the Lake <HI>Lemane,</HI> by many cal|led the Lake of <HI>Geneva.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t foundation of it was laid in the year of the World 3994. upon a little ri&s;ing Hill covered with Juniper Trees, called by the French <HI>Geneuriers,</HI> from whence it afterwards took the name of <HI>Geneura; Lemanus</HI> having gran|ted many Priviledges to the place, and erected the &s;ame into a City incorpo|rated with great immunities and free|domes,
<PB N="2" REF="5">pre&s;crib'd them a Form of Go|vernment &s;uitable to the Cu&s;tomes of tho&s;e times.</P>
<P>In the time of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> this Ci|ty was of great renown, and by him called the Bulwork of <HI>Helvetia,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Julius Cae|&s;ar.</NOTE> and frontiere Town of the <HI>Allobrogi,</HI> which name at pre&s;ent it de&s;erves more than ever.</P>
<P>When the eruption was made upon the <HI>Swi&s;&s;ers</HI> in the year of God 230. by the Emperor <HI>Heliogabalus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Heliogabi|lus.</NOTE> <HI>Geneva</HI> was al|mo&s;t utterly de&s;troyed by Fire; but in the time of <HI>Aurelian</HI> the Emperour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;troyed.</NOTE> about the year of Grace 270. it was by the command of the &s;ame Emperor rebuilt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rebuilt.</NOTE> who having be&s;towed many priviledges on tho&s;e that came to repair it, com|manded it for the future to be called <HI>Aurelia,</HI> but the Inhabitants could not ea&s;ily bani&s;h from their minds the an|cient name of <HI>Geneva,</HI> which to this day it holds, tho during the Life of <HI>Aure|lian,</HI> they called it <HI>Aurelia.</HI></P>
<P>The Situation of this City is one of the plea&s;ante&s;t in <HI>Europe,</HI> being on the North &s;ide, wa&s;hed by the Lake, and on the South adorned with a &s;patious
<PB N="3" REF="5">Neighbouring Plain, reaching to the very Walls, and encompa&s;&s;ed by two large Rivers, the <HI>Rone</HI> and the <HI>Arue.</HI></P>
<P>This plain &s;erves the Citizens for a place of diver&s;ion and Recreation: There they walk to take the Air, and refre&s;h them&s;elves in the delightful Gardens, which inviron it, of which there is a great number. There like|wi&s;e they train and exerci&s;e their Soul|diers, and divert them&s;elves at Play in a long Mall.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Plain Pa|lace.</NOTE>This Plain is commonly called the <HI>Plain Palace,</HI> and in a Corner thereof, where the <HI>Arue</HI> falls into the <HI>Rone,</HI> there is a &s;patious burying place for the dead.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burying-Place.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Confines of <HI>Geneva</HI> are on the Ea&s;t, and South the Dutchy of <HI>Savoy,</HI> on the We&s;t the Country of <HI>Gex</HI> belong|ing to the King of <HI>France,</HI> and on the North &s;ide the Lake. <HI>Lemane,</HI> and be|yond that <HI>Switzerland:</HI> From the Stee|ple of St. <HI>Peters</HI> Church, which is a &s;trong high Tower might have been &s;een formerly &s;ix (tho at pre&s;ent but five Principalities, the Spani&s;h <HI>Burgun|dy</HI> being united to <HI>France</HI>) to wit, <HI>Sa|voy, France,</HI> the Spani&s;h <HI>Burgundy, Swit|zerland,
<PB N="4" REF="6">Sion,</HI> and <HI>Geneva,</HI> a thing &s;o &s;ingular, as cannot be parallel'd in the World.</P>
<P>This City hath of a long time been walled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fortifica|tions.</NOTE> and indifferently well fortified; but &s;ince the year 1659. the Fortifica|tions both within and without have been augmented with Ba&s;tions, half-Moons, and Bulwarks, at which they are &s;till bu&s;ily imployed, the Engineer of the Republick, an expert and skil|ful Arti&s;t, daily a&s;&s;i&s;ting and over-&s;eeing their work.</P>
<P>In the year 1662. The States and o|ther private Per&s;ons of the United <HI>Ne|therlands</HI> made a Pre&s;ent to the Repub|lick of above thirty thou&s;and Crowns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hollanders</NOTE> which Sum was applyed to the rai&s;ing of a &s;trong and regular Bulwork on the &s;ide of the <HI>Rone,</HI> whereon by Order of the Senate this In&s;cription was put,</P>
<Q><HI>Oppugna oppugnantes me ex munificenti&acirc; Cel&s;i&s;&s;. Ordinum Faederatorum</HI> Belgii, 1663.</Q>
<P>The City &s;eems divided,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bridges.</NOTE> becau&s;e the <HI>Rone</HI> running through it maketh two I&s;lands, that &s;u&s;tain four Bridges, two whereof which joyn to St. <HI>Gerva&s;e</HI> have
<PB N="5" REF="6">hou&s;es and &s;hops upon them, but the other two that are united with the bo|dy of the City, &s;ince the fire in the year 1670. have been left open with|out any hou&s;es to cover them.</P>
<P>Before the Reformation there were many ca&s;ual fires, &s;ometimes in one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fires.</NOTE> and &s;ometimes in another part of the City; but &s;ince the year 1534 that the Reformation began, until 1670. by the grace of God and provident care of the Magi&s;trates, the City remained free from any &s;uch accident, when on <HI>Mon|day</HI> the 17th. of <HI>January</HI> about twelve of the Clock at night a dreadful fire broke out upon one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t inhabited of the four Bridges, and burnt with &s;o much force and rage, that in the &s;pace of three hours, tho the night was calm, without a breath of Wind &s;tirring, the whole buildings, to the number of three&s;core and ten hou&s;es, were utterly con&s;umed in the Conflagration, above an hundred and thirty Families deprived of habitation and a hundred Per&s;ons, Men, Women, and Children de&s;troyed in the mercile&s;s flames; a dreadfull argument, that if the People could not e&s;cape with
<PB N="6" REF="7">their Lives, they cou'd not &s;ave their Goods. The lo&s;s was reputed to a|mount to a French Million of Mony, and was the greater, becau&s;e many &s;ub|&s;tantial Merchants lived upon that Bridge. Many Collections were pre|&s;ently made throughout the City, for the relief of tho&s;e poor People that were burnt out of all, and the Prote|&s;tants of <HI>Switzerland, Germany,</HI> and o|ther places gave &s;ea&s;onable in&s;tances of their Charity to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed upon that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Bridge is now rebuilt with mo&s;t excellent Workman&s;hip,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New-B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">idge.</NOTE> but by Decree of the Senate no hou&s;es nor Shops are for the future to be built upon it, tho it be much &s;tronger now than it was before, &s;o that the City &s;eems at pre&s;ent di|vided.</P>
<P>The Fabrick of their hou&s;es is not very con&s;iderable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their Buil|ding.</NOTE> the People having been alwayes more addicted to conveni|ence than magnificence, &s;o that we need &s;ay nothing but of their publick Structu|res, which are, the Town Hou&s;e, repaired and beautified &s;ince the Reformation, the Ar&s;enal, five publick Granaries, the Mint and the Towers, two of which

<P>There is be&s;ides a Colledge built &s;ince the Reformation, containing Schools for the Youth that learn humanity, and hou&s;es for the Mini&s;ters and Profe&s;|&s;ors.</P>
<P>There were heretofore mo&s;t magni|ficent Buildings, both for the Regular and Secular Clergy, and e&s;pecially the rich Abbey of St. <HI>Victor,</HI> the Abbot whereof was a Temporal Prince inve|&s;ted with many Juri&s;dictions.</P>
<P>In the great Hall of the Colledge is the Library, furni&s;hed with excellent Old Books. The Library Keeper is a Mini&s;ter, who is to take care of it, and &s;hew it to &s;uch Strangers as de&s;ire to &s;ee it.</P>

<P>St. <HI>Peters</HI> Church was in ancient times dedicated to <HI>Apollo,</HI> as is to be &s;een in &s;ome very old In&s;criptions, &s;e|veral Cardinals and many Prelates of great Renown were buried in this Church when the Romi&s;h Religion flouri&s;hed here; and &s;ince the Refor|mation in one of its Chappels, <HI>An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">o</HI> 1628. was interred <HI>Emilia</HI> of <HI>Na&s;&s;au,</HI> and &s;ometime after the Prince&s;s her Si|&s;ter, both Si&s;ters to the Prince of <HI>O|range, Emilia</HI> being Wife to <HI>Don Anto|nio</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> who was bani&s;hed by the Spaniards.

But the <HI>French</HI> (who of late are &s;eldome a&s;leep when their intere&s;t lies at &s;take, and who pretend to &s;way or give laws to all <HI>Europe</HI>) having the matter in the wind, thought it convenient to &s;end a Re&s;ident to <HI>Geneva,</HI> to the end that by exerci&s;ing there &s;ome litte Juri&s;dicti|on by which the Law of Nations is al|lowed to publick Mini&s;ters, they might baulk the <HI>Switzers</HI> in their preten&s;i|ons, and confirm their King &s;ole Protector of that City and Repub|lick.</P>
<P>About the end therefore of the year
<PB N="75" REF="41">1679, Moun&s;ieur <HI>Chanvigny</HI> was &s;ent Re&s;ident to <HI>Geneva,</HI> a man of a low Stature, but hotter temper than well &s;uited with his Age of three&s;core years. This man having a Son in orders, and in expectation of Preferment, that he might curry favour with the Church|men, and e&s;pecially the Court of <HI>Rome,</HI> began to exerci&s;e his charge with ex|treme violence, in&s;omuch that not &s;atisfied with the allowance of a Chap|pel in his own Hou&s;e for his private devotion, he wrote Letters all about, inviting the Catholicks in the Neigh|bourhood at <HI>Geneva</HI> to come publickly to Ma&s;s at his Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor did he &s;top here, but &s;ollicited all the Curats and Monks in tho&s;e parts to come and &s;ay Ma&s;s in <HI>Geneva,</HI> and often employed &s;everal of the Je&s;uits of <HI>Horne</HI> to Preach, inviting all the Neighbouring Catholicks to the exer|ci&s;e. This was &s;o ill reli&s;hed by the People, that &s;ome of the rabble ca&s;t of all re&s;pect due to a Per&s;on of his Character, &s;o that two of them were committed to Pri&s;on, being ac|cu&s;ed for having fired &s;ome Pi&s;tol-&s;hot within the Court of the &s;aid Re&s;ident.
<PB N="76" REF="42">The noi&s;e of this reaching as far as <HI>Paris,</HI> moved the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King to take information of the matter of Fact, who, thereupon ordered the relea&s;ing of the Poi&s;oners, and recalled <HI>Chanvigny</HI> to <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;ending in his place Mon&s;ieur <HI>du Pr&eacute;,</HI> a per&s;on of very great experi|ence, as the offices which he hath di&s;|charged hath &s;ufficiently made appear: And the truth is, this Gentleman lives in very good corre&s;pondence, both with the Senate and people; and tho he have Ma&s;s &s;aid in his Hou&s;e, yet it is with &s;uch moderation, as in appear|ance removes all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3+ letters">n&s;ie from the minds of the People, who now begin to be acquainted with the freaki&s;hne&s;s and in con&s;tancy of Fortune.</P>
