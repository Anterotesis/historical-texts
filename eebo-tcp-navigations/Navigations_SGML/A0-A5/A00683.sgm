<P>_A Noueltie of &s;o high a nature as this is, (in which all <HI>Chri&s;tendome,</HI> or the greate&s;t part of it, &s;tandeth intere&s;&s;ed) &s;hould not Pre&s;ent it &s;elfe to the world, without the Noble at|tendance of Probabilitie and Po&s;&s;ibilitie, the one to confirme the Truth, the other to enable the Action: Both which (to cleere vnder&s;tanding eyes) are Wayters vpon this.</P>

<HEAD>The Spani&s;h Relation.</HEAD>
<P>BLe&s;&s;ings from Heauen, and good wi|&s;hes on Earth, be euer attendant on All tho&s;e, who are zealous in the &s;eruice of GOD, and the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Common-good: as al&s;o, on this League Vnited together by the Emperor, and celebrated with all the Rites in <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> before the mo&s;t Excel|lent
<PB N="3" REF="3">INFANTA, both in regard of the Au|thoritie, which her <HI>Altezza</HI> (or Highnes) hath in that Citie, as al&s;o, for the Scitua|tion, honor, and commodity of the place.</P>
<P>And albeit, I am well a&s;&s;ured, that his Imperiall Maie&s;tie, hath with much deli|beration and wi&s;dome, made tryall in his Iudgement of all tho&s;e things which are comprehended in this League; yet not|with&s;tanding (as well to &s;atisfie my &s;elfe as to di&s;charge the duty belonging to my place, which I hold vnder his Catholicke Maie&s;tie) I will briefly &s;et downe my knowledge in this great Bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, be|cau&s;e happily, &s;ome may gather the fruit of experience from it, as the Bee &s;uckes Honey out of a bitter Flower.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, it hath bin held a matter of great importance, that in this League &s;hould bee comprehended, his Holine&s;&s;e, the Maie&s;ties Imperiall and Catholicke, all the Princes of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> the Catholick Electors, all the chiefe Princes, Potentates, and Republickes Catholicke, in <HI>Germany, Italy, Flaunders, &amp;c.</HI> well affe|cted to the <HI>Sea Apo&s;tolicall,</HI> and to their
<PB N="4" REF="4">Maie&s;ties. Herein &s;hewing a de&s;ire to &s;ow Peace, Quietne&s;&s;e and Iu&s;tice, among&s;t all tho&s;e States, ouer which God hath placed them, thereby to e&s;tabli&s;h a new League euerla&s;ting and hereditary, as Friends to Friends, and Enemies to Enemies, with Penall clau&s;es and other nece&s;&s;ary Parti|culars.</P>
<P>Secondly, that this League &s;hould bee publi&s;hed and declared by Amba&s;&s;adors or Agents, (Ordinary or Extraordinary) to all other Kings, Princes, Potentates, and States, which are Friends, albeit not well affected, or being of another Religi|on. For this mu&s;t worke one of the&s;e two Things; either they mu&s;t &s;end to this Diet (or A&s;&s;embly) and enter as the re&s;t doe into the League vpon the &s;ame Con|ditions; or if they refu&s;e &s;o to doe, then are they to bee excluded and barred from any benefit which by the League may a|ri&s;e, and &s;o bee branded with the Notes, markes, and blemi&s;hes of Ob&s;tinacy, and euill Hearts, they of the League hereby hauing ju&s;t cau&s;e giuen them, to beware of &s;uch people.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="4">
<P>Concerning Trade and Commerce, be|twixt tho&s;e of the League, their Friends, Subiects and Va&s;&s;als; the &s;ame libertie &s;hall bee giuen them which heretofore they haue had without Exception, and without any new Cu&s;tomes, Impo&s;itions or other Duties, than tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary Pay|ments which mu&s;t be di&s;pended to fight again&s;t Rebels and knowne Enemies.</P>
<P>What Occurrent, fact, or difference &s;o|euer &s;hall happen betweene any of the Colleagued Princes, or any of their Sub|iects; it &s;hall bee ended and taken vp by the Soueraigne Prince to whom the ac|knowledgement thereof doth appertaine, or by him, who with con&s;ent of the re&s;t of the League, or the major part, &s;hall be held fit to decide it: and what &s;entence hee &s;ets downe &s;hall peremptorily &s;tand, vpon paine of being Expul&s;ed from the Societie of the League, or to feele the &s;harpne&s;&s;e of their Indignation.</P>
<P>The Pope, Emperor, euery King, Prince, Potentate, and State, which enters into this League, &s;hall giue the Number of &s;uch Forces (Hor&s;e and Foot) which wil|lingly
<PB N="6" REF="5">they intend to furni&s;h; a&s;well tho&s;e which they haue already rai&s;ed, and paide in their owne Kingdomes and Territo|ries, as of any other Troupes, which they are to rai&s;e with all expedition and at their proper Charges, vpon any occa&s;ion what&s;oeuer, to the due ob&s;eruance of the League, which is confederated together for Three &s;peciall ends.</P>
<P N="1">1 <HI>The first, to Con&s;erue Peace, Ju|&s;tice and Amitie, amongst the Col|leagues, and to Cha&s;ti&s;e any one that falls off, and doth not accompli&s;h what hee promi&s;eth.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>The &s;econd, to prevent, curbe and bridle any other Prince, (albeit not one of the League) when&s;oever hee offers to Invade, directly or indirectly, any of the Confederate Princes.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>Thirdly, to make quicke Warre vpon the Common Enemy, as Rebels, Turkes, Moores, Tartars, &amp;c. Pro|uided
<PB N="7" REF="5">there bee a generall Con&s;ent &s;o to haue it done.</HI></P>
<P>Now, to &s;how, that for euery Prince to deliuer vp the Number of all &s;uch men, as hee hath already leauyed and payed, (or the greater part of them) can bee to him no danger or lo&s;&s;e, but rather a mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured &s;afetie and profit. And it is fir&s;t to be con&s;idered, that none of them can receiue any harme, &s;eeing they haue the like intere&s;t whether they maintaine their men within or without their State. Se|condly, concerning the perill, it is certaine that leauying in their ordinary Garri&s;ons, for the time that may be nece&s;&s;ary &s;ome expert Commanders, and diuers skilfull Souldiers, which euer any Prince v&s;ed to haue without pay onely for his defence, they cannot therefore runne into any pe|rill or danger.</P>
<P>Now, for the third point which is Safetie, It is plaine, that when&s;oeuer any Stranger &s;hall attempt to wrong any of the Confederated Princes, who punctu|ally haue deliuered all or part of &s;uch
<PB N="8" REF="6">Forces as by them are leauyed; It is mo&s;t certaine (and &s;o re&s;olued vpon) that All the re&s;t &s;hall take his part, and defend him by &s;uch meanes, as in their be&s;t Iudge|ments &s;hall be held fit.</P>
<P>Hereupon it is inferred, that if in the beginning of tho&s;e troubles and Calami|ties, which &s;et <HI>Germany, Flaunders, Italy,</HI> and <HI>France</HI> on fire, there had beene &s;uch another League with a ready and faith|full Intelligence pa&s;&s;ing betweene tho&s;e Chri&s;tian Princes, which were truely ju&s;t, and religiou&s;ly giuen; Then, it had kept the <HI>Germanes</HI> from Revolting, the <HI>Bohe|mians, Tran&s;ilvanians, Hollanders,</HI> and <HI>Pala|tinate</HI> from Rebelling; neither, had the <HI>Venetians</HI> euer &s;o much as dreamed of an Inua&s;ion to bee made vpon the Empe|rours Townes; no, nor had the <HI>Savoyans</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> put on Armes fir&s;t again&s;t <HI>Mantua,</HI> and then again&s;t <HI>Genoa,</HI> woun|ding (in both the&s;e times) the Subiects of his Catholicke Maie&s;tie; Neither, had the <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Venetians,</HI> &s;potted their Names with &s;uch infamous reproaches, for Tea|ring from his Holines the <HI>Valtoline,</HI> which
<PB N="9" REF="6">vpon the Accord, and ingagement of the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> King him&s;elfe, was deliuered vp in tru&s;t to the hands of his Holines: Nay more, tho&s;e other infinite In&s;olencies, Sa|criledges, and Inhumanities (which for mode&s;ties &s;ake I bury in &s;ilence) had ne|uer beene &s;o barbarou&s;ly committed, to the &s;hedding of &s;o much Innocent blood, the lo&s;&s;e of &s;o much wealth, and vtter ruine of &s;o much noble Reputation.</P>
<P>Great hope therefore there is, that &s;uch a number of Chri&s;tian Princes, entring together into this Holy League, there will follow not onely an amendment of Abu|&s;es pa&s;t, but a preuention of many Euils to come. It being held for certaine, that when this League is fully publi&s;hed and made knowne, all the Oppo&s;ites again&s;t it, &s;hall neuer bee able to beget a &s;econd Combination (among&s;t them&s;elues) of &s;ufficient Power to conte&s;t or contend a|gain&s;t the Fourth part of this.</P>

Let them performe the be&s;t of their power, &amp; doe what they can, yet your Holine&s;&s;e knowes, that God is a|ble to effect much more: and I for my part (his diuine Arme a&s;&s;i&s;ting me) will (as I am bound) doe my vtmo&s;t in de|fence of the Catholick Faith, as my Fore|fathers haue done before me.</P>

<P>The common rumour is, that they intend their cour&s;e for Ireland; but the mo&s;t knowing, &s;ay for England, the Dunkerkers (as it is reported) hauing &s;ownded all the Sea-coa&s;t, and a&s;&s;uring them an entrance free from all danger.</P>
<P>Among&s;t all the Engines and warlike furniture, which comes alongwith them, they al&s;o bring &s;tore of Ouens, and Mils made of Iron or Bra&s;&s;e, and will make their i&s;&s;ue by the motion of wheeles, on which they are mounted.</P>
<P>Thus this great Archer of the World (who&s;e Bow reacheth from the Ea&s;t to the We&s;t Indies, and who&s;e &s;tring is twi&s;ted together by the Hands and Hearts of Confederated Kings and Princes) &s;hoots his Arrowes at this our Kingdome of Eng|land, making account to come and cleane the glo|ry
<PB REF="12">of it, and then to march backe into Spaine as a Triumphant Conquerour.</P>
<P>This <HI>Nimrod</HI> is a mightie Hunter, and by his good will, would &s;trike downe none but whole Nations: Hauocke hee cryes what Parke &s;o euer hee comes into; and the goodlier the Herds are, the more cruelly does hee &s;catter them. Millions of poore murthered Indians being the Trophies of his bloudy Shambles.</P>
<P>But as the beginning of the fir&s;t <HI>Nimrods</HI> King|dome, was Babell, &s;o the end of this &s;econd (Gods Almightie Arme tumbling downe the buil|dings of his Ambition) &s;hall bee Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>What though fiue Kings complot, combine, and incorporate their Forces in One, to fight a|gain&s;t <HI>Io&s;ua?</HI> Let not vs feare, but &s;end vp our Cries to Heauen, as the Men of Gibeon (a great and Royall Citie) &s;ent theirs to <HI>Io&s;ua,</HI> euen to the Ho&s;t at Gilgall, and as they to Him, &s;o let vs call to God, and &s;ay, <HI>Withdraw not thy Hand from thy Seruants; Come vp to vs quickly, and &s;aue vs, and helpe vs;</HI> for all the Kings of the Amorites (Spinolized and Spaniolized Tyrants) thine and our Enemies, which dwell in the Mountaines, are gathered together again&s;t vs.</P>
<P>Wee mu&s;t &s;hake off our &s;innes when wee doe thus, and not cry with a faint and di&s;tru&s;ting voyce that hee will not heare vs, for if we &s;peake to him as wee ought to doe, Hee him&s;elfe will
<PB REF="12">&s;ay thus to our <HI>Io&s;hua; Feare them not, for I haue giuen them into thine hand: None of them &s;hall &s;tand against thee.</HI></P>
<P>And as the Lord kept his Word with Him, &s;o will hee with vs: Hee will &s;mite the&s;e Col|leagued Enemies to his Truth and Go&s;pell, <HI>euen to Azekah, and Makkedah,</HI> (their Gibraltars and Magellanes) and as they are cha&s;ed to Beth|horon (into Spaine) hee will (for their poy&s;o|ned Bullets prepared to &s;hoote at vs) ca&s;t downe great &s;tones from Heauen vpon them, vntill more dye by that haile, then by the &s;word.</P>
<P>Then &s;hall the&s;e Confederated Kings of Ieru|&s;alem, Hebron, Iarmuth, Lachi&s;h and Eg|lon, flye to their Caues (their Spani&s;h Dens) vntill the Chiefe Men of this our I&s;raell by our <HI>Io&s;hua's</HI> command, fetch them forth to &s;et their feete vpon the neckes of &s;uch in&s;olent In|&s;ulters.</P>
<P>Shall I reade to you, another &s;tory of com|fort? Hearken then to it.</P>
<P>When <HI>Benhadad</HI> the King of Aram, had a&s;&s;embled all his Armie, with two and thir|tie Kings to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, hauing great num|bers both of Hor&s;es and warlike Chariots, hee be&s;ieged Samaria; and &s;ending a di&s;dainfull me&s;&s;age to <HI>Ahab</HI> King of I&s;raell, thus hee commanded tho&s;e that went to terrifie him, Tell <HI>Ahab</HI> (quoth hee) <HI>that thy gold is Mine, al&s;o thy women and thy faire Children are Mine; or
<PB REF="13">el&s;e, I will &s;end my &s;eruants vnto thee</HI> (as the King of Spaine would now his <HI>Ianizaries</HI> into England) <HI>and they &s;hall &s;earch thine Hou&s;e, and the Hou&s;es of thy Seruants, and what&s;oeuer is plea&s;ing in thine eyes, they &s;hall take it in their hands, and bring it away.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Ahab</HI> taking Coun&s;ell of the Elders, did at the &s;econd &s;ending, refu&s;e to part from any thing.</P>
<P>Herevpon <HI>Benhadad</HI> in a rage fel a rauing, and &s;aid, <HI>The Gods do &s;o to me, and more al&s;o, if the dust of Samaria, be enough to all the people that follow me, for euery man a handfull.</HI></P>
<P>Poore Samaria was now in a terrible feare, <HI>Benhadad</HI> roared, I&s;raell trembled: but God ca&s;ting an Eye of Compa&s;&s;ion vpon their Ca|lamities, and an Eye of Scorne on the others tyrannies, &s;ent a Prophet to <HI>Ahab,</HI> who told him this good tydings (after one Army ouer|throwne by <HI>Ahab</HI> the yeere before) <HI>I will de|liuer this great multitude into thy hands again, and yee &s;hall know that I am the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>His word was true, the children of I&s;raell &s;tood in the field in the day of Battaile <HI>like two little flockes of Kiddes, but the Aramites coue|red the whole Countrey:</HI> yet the poore Handfull had the victory: the Sheepe beate the Lions, and &s;lue in that day a hundred thou&s;and Ara|mites (all footmen.)</P>
<P>It is not Number that preuailes, but good|ne&s;&s;e
<PB REF="13">of the Cau&s;e. When Iu&s;tice guardes the Standard, Safetie is Generall of the Field.</P>
<P>No matter what proud defiance, a daring <HI>Philistine</HI> throwes into our faces, there is an Arme Omnipotent can direct a Peeble-&s;tone (beeing but put into a Sling) to &s;ticke in the Giants fore-head, both to &s;trike him dead, and confound the whole Armie that comes a|long with him.</P>
<P>Regard not the Braues of a bla&s;pheming <HI>Rab&s;hecay</HI> &s;ent from <HI>Senacherib</HI> King of A&s;hur, to the Cities of Iuda, For a voyce from the mouth of the God of Ho&s;ts, &s;hall come to an <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> &s;aying thus much. <HI>As for A&s;hur, Hee &s;hall not enter into this Citie, nor &s;hoote an Arrow at it, nor come before it with a Shield, nor cast a Mount against it; but hee &s;hall returne the way he came, and &s;hall not come into this Citie.</HI> What followed vpon this comforta|ble promi&s;e? <HI>The &s;ame night, the Angell went out, and &s;mote in the Campe of A&s;hur, one hundred foure&s;core and fiue thou&s;and men.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Senacherib</HI> e&s;caped from the &s;laughter, but not from Gods vengeance; for afterwards, as in his Temple be was wor&s;hipping <HI>Ni&s;rech</HI> (his God) <HI>Adramelech,</HI> and <HI>Sharezer his owne Sonnes, &s;lew him with the &s;word.</HI></P>
<P>Many Examples to this purpo&s;e may bee brought into the Field, of infinite Armies, of Idolatrous Nations fighting again&s;t Iuda and
<PB REF="14">I&s;raell, and yet were then &s;till (&s;o long as they held in with God) by weake and wa&s;ted troupes confounded.</P>
<P>For, God hath &s;till a Red Sea to &s;tand vp an end on either &s;ide of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and the I&s;raelites like a double Brazen wall to guard his people, but to fall downe in rough billowes, to ouerwhelme <HI>Pharao</HI> and his Ho&s;t.</P>
<P>Yet wee mu&s;t not pre&s;ume too much vpon Gods fauour, as if we were his onely Darlings, and all other Nations, Ca&s;t-awayes. No there is no &s;uch excellence in vs, that hee &s;hould dote vpon our beautie, which is nothing el&s;e but a loth&s;ome Deformitie.</P>
<P>We haue beene &s;courged lately, with one of <HI>Dauids</HI> whips, but the Beating is forgotten, and therefore we were be&s;t take heed, le&s;t this &s;econd Rod drawes bloud indeed. Our &s;innes are in our hearts, when our &s;words are in our hands, and the mu&s;tering of the One, frights vs from &s;triking with the other. Turne away the fir&s;t, and God will teach vs how to turne the &s;econd vpon the bo&s;omes of our Enemies.</P>
<P>It is folly to goe into the field to fight, vnle&s;&s;e God &s;ends out his Prie&s;t, to haue vs &s;erue vnder his Colours: Let vs take his pay and wee mu&s;t needs prooue Noble Souldiers: Euery Engli&s;h|man make but peace with his owne Con&s;cience, and be carefull that it betrayes him not, and hee needs not feare any Spani&s;h Inua&s;ion.</P>
<PB REF="14">
<P>Spani&s;h Inua&s;ion! The&s;e Thunderings and Lightnings, may bee but Terrors talked of, and not &s;eene: or if &s;eene, not certainly ay|ming where to doe mi&s;chiefe: they may hurt others &s;ooner then Vs: The&s;e Spani&s;h Canons, happily carrie no Bullets in them, but giue one|ly a fal&s;e fire.</P>
<P>The&s;e Rumours and Tumours, Whirle|winds, Vproares and Combu&s;tions, filling the Chri&s;tian World with Amazement, and vs with expectation of &s;ome dreadfull Mon&s;ter to bee pre&s;ented to all wondring eyes, may per|chance bring forth onely That ridiculous Mou&s;e, of which the Mountaynes were &s;o long in labour.</P>
<P>It is well, if it bee &s;o: The <HI>Beati Pacifici</HI> is a &s;tring which makes heauenly Mu&s;icke in a Kingdome.</P>
<P>Yet, if wee lift vp our heads, to ob&s;erue what eyes the Spaniard ca&s;ts at vs, and what good Prayers he &s;hoots after vs; Wi&s;dome may &s;oone per&s;wade, that hee does not loue vs; if not loue vs, wee are not to tru&s;t Him, (albeit hee lyes &s;till) no more then to tru&s;t a &s;leeping Lion or a Ma&s;tiffe: and therefore (not to dan|dle our &s;elues too much vpon the knees of &s;e|curitie) let vs row&s;e vp our Engli&s;h Spirits, and bee armed, again&s;t this &s;potted Bea&s;t doe come, albeit hee bee not comming, le&s;t with his pawes hee teare vs in pieces, when wee are
<PB REF="15">not prouided for his dreadfull Encounters.</P>
<P>Spani&s;h Bulles are fierce at the &s;take, and wor&s;e loo&s;e, and although in Madrill, Siuill, and others Cities, they baite them for plea&s;ure, in England they would yeeld no &s;uch pa&s;time. If Fame therefore, hath taught her thou&s;and Tongues to tell Truth, and that the&s;e Ca&s;ti|lian Ecchoes mocke vs not with Lyes, Is it not high time for euery man to girt his loynes with the &s;word, and to fight Gods Battaile, for this Quarrell is again&s;t Him?</P>
<P>If this holy League be knit together, to teare Anointed Kings, out of their hereditary thrones, and to turne Nations out of their Natiue Coun|tries; It is not a Holy, but a Deuilli&s;h League: A Confederacie of vncleane Spirits: An Vnion of Di&s;cord, and Helli&s;h Mu&s;icke.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e then, who haue commands ouer Nar|row Seas (who&s;e Nur&s;ing Armes mo&s;t louingly embrace our Kingdomes body, bu&s;ie them&s;elues in their Nauall-Military Preparations; while&s;t they on Land mu&s;ter together to guard our Kingdomes Heart.</P>
<P>Let our Engli&s;h Nobles giue Heroicall Con|frontations to the Spani&s;h <HI>Grandees</HI> and <HI>Dons:</HI> the Gentry hearten on the Commons, and the Commons goe with cheerfull faces, again&s;t this Enemie, as their Fore-fathers haue done, when they fetched Honour from other Countries.</P>
<P>While&s;t the Diuine prayes at home, for &s;uc|ce&s;&s;e
<PB REF="15">abroad: whil&s;t the Lawyer &s;pends &s;ome of his Golden Fees, to the maintenance of Soul|diers, in &s;o glorious a warre: while&s;t Citizens open bounteous Pur&s;es, (though they goe not in Per&s;on) to defend them&s;elues, and Country|men: while&s;t the &s;trong runne to fight, and the weake looke to their Hou&s;es at home: whil&s;t the Rich emptie their bagges, to maintaine the poore Souldiers in good clothes and whol&s;ome diet: Nay, while&s;t euen the very Blinde and Lame (when they can doe nothing el&s;e) &s;end vp their heartie wi&s;hes to Heauen (night and day) to crowne our Land with Conque&s;t, to con|found all bloudie and execrable Confederations with ruine and &s;hame, and to &s;end home this &s;econd Armipotent Armado (if any &s;uch there be) in Tempe&s;ts, Whirle-winds and Wracks, as that was in Eighty eight. To which all true hearted Engli&s;hmen will crie <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
