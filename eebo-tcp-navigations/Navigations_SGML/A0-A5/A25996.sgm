<HEAD>A COMPLEAT DISCOVERY OF THE State of Carolina, In the YEAR 1682.</HEAD>
<P>THE Di&s;cour&s;es of many Ingenious Travellers (who have lately &s;een this part of the <HI>We&s;t Indies)</HI> have for Salubrity of Air, Fertility of Soyl, for the Luxuriant and Indulgent Ble&s;&s;ings of Nature, ju&s;tly rendred <HI>Carolina</HI> Famous.

<P>Having &s;pent near three Years Abroad, in which time I had a fair Opportunity of a Survey of great part of our Engli&s;h <HI>A|merica.</HI> You my Worthy Friend, knowing in what Character I went abroad, and un|der&s;tanding of my being at <HI>Carolina,</HI> did ob|ligingly reque&s;t (that at Lei&s;ure) I would collect &s;uch Notices of my own whil&s;t there, with tho&s;e Remarques and Ob&s;ervations which I had learnt from the mo&s;t Able and Ingenious Planters, who have had their Re|&s;idence on the place from its fir&s;t being Co|loniz'd: You de&s;iring to be a&s;&s;ured whether the true State of the Country did an&s;wer the Reports of Common Fame. Which in Compliance with, and in Obedience to your Commands, I have undertaken.</P>

Or from <HI>Charles</HI> the Ninth of that Name King of <HI>France,</HI> in who&s;e Reign a Colony of <HI>French Prote&s;tants</HI> were tran&s;ported thither, at the encouragement of <HI>Ga&s;par Coligni,</HI> Admiral of that Kingdom; the place of their fir&s;t Settlement named in Honour of their Prince <HI>Arx Carolina</HI>; but not long after, that Colony, with Mon&s;ieur <HI>Ribault</HI> their Leader, were by the <HI>Spaniard</HI> at once cut off and de&s;troy'd. Since which, nor <HI>French,</HI> nor <HI>Spaniard</HI> have made any Attempt for its Re-Settlement. <HI>Carolina</HI> is the Northermo&s;t part of the &s;pacious and plea&s;ant Province of <HI>Florida</HI>; it lies in the <HI>Northern</HI> temperate Zone, between the Lati|tude of Twenty Nine, and Thirty Six De|grees, and Thirty Minutes: It's boun|ded on the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> with the Atlantick, or <HI>Nor|thern,</HI> on the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> with the Pacifick or <HI>Sou|thern</HI>

In <HI>July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> they have &s;ometimes Touches of Agues and Fe|vers, but not violent, of &s;hort continuance, and never Fatal. <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Children there born, are commonly &s;trong and lu&s;ty, of &s;ound Con&s;titutions, and fre&s;h ruddy Complexions. The Sea&s;ons are regularly di&s;po&s;ed according to Natures Laws; the Summer not &s;o torrid, hot and burning as that of their <HI>Southern,</HI> nor the Winter &s;o rigorou&s;ly &s;harp and cold, as that of their <HI>Northern</HI> Neighbours. In the Evenings and Mornings of <HI>December</HI> and <HI>Ja|nuary,</HI> thin congealed Ice, with hoary Fro&s;ts &s;ometimes appear; but as &s;oon as the Sun e|levates her &s;elf, above the <HI>Horizon,</HI> as &s;oon

<P>The Soil near the Sea, of a Mould Sandy, farther di&s;tant, more clayey, or Sand and Clay mixt; the Land lies upon a Level in fifty or &s;ixty Miles round, having &s;carce the lea&s;t Hill or Eminency. It's cloathed with odoriferous and fragrant Woods, flouri&s;hing in perpetual and con&s;tant Verdures, <HI>viz.</HI> the lofty Pine, the &s;weet &s;melling <HI>Cedar</HI> and <HI>Cy|prus</HI> Trees, of both which are compo&s;ed good|ly Boxes, Che&s;ts, Tables, Scrittores, and Ca|binets. The Du&s;t and Shavings of <HI>Cedar,</HI> laid among&s;t Linnen or Woollen, de&s;troys the Moth and all Verminous In&s;ects: It ne|ver rots, breeding no Worm, by which ma|ny other Woods are con&s;umed and de&s;troy|ed. Of <HI>Cedar</HI> there are many &s;orts; this in <HI>Carolina</HI> is e&s;teemed of equal Goodne&s;s for Grain, Smell and Colour with the <HI>Bermudi|an Cedar,</HI> which of all the <HI>We&s;t Indian</HI> is e&s;teem|ed the mo&s;t excellent; that in the <HI>Caribbe</HI> I|&s;lands

and <HI>Jamaica</HI> being of a cour&s;er kind, Oyl and the Spirit of Wine penetrating it; but with this they make Heading for their Cask, which the &s;harpe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;earching Liquors does not pierce. With the Berry of the Tree at <HI>Bermudaz,</HI> by Decoction, they make a very whole&s;ome and &s;overeign Drink. This Tree in the Sacred Writ is famous, e|&s;pecially tho&s;e of <HI>Lebanon,</HI> for their Stately Stature; but tho&s;e in the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> I ob&s;er|ved to be of a low and humble height. The <HI>Sa&s;&s;afra&s;s</HI> is a Medicinal Tree, who&s;e Bark and Leaves yield a plea&s;ing Smell: It profits in all Di&s;ea&s;es of the Blood, and Liver, par|ticularly in all Venereal and Scorbutick Di|&s;tempers. There are many other Fragrant &s;melling trees, the <HI>Myrtle, Bay</HI> and <HI>Lawrel,</HI> &s;everal Others to us wholly unknown. Fruit Trees there are in abundance of various and excel|lent kinds, the Orange, Lemon, Pomegra|nate, Fig and Almond. Of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fruits, the Apple, Pear, Plumb, Cherry, Quince,
<PB N="7" REF="6">
Peach, a &s;ort of Medlar, and Che&s;nut. Wall|nut Trees there are of two or three &s;orts; but the Black Wallnut for its Grain, is mo&s;t e&s;teem'd: the Wild Wallnut, or Hiquery-Tree, gives the <HI>Indians,</HI> by boyling its Ker|nel, a whole&s;ome Oyl, from whom the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> frequently &s;upply them&s;elves for their Kitchen u&s;es: It's commended for a good Remedy in Dolors, and Gripes of the Bel|ly; whil&s;t new it has a plea&s;ant Ta&s;te; but after &s;ix Moneths, it decays and grows acid; I believe it might make a good Oyl, and of as general an u&s;e as that of the Olive, if it were better purified and rectified. The <HI>Chin|copin</HI> Tree bears a Nut not unlike the <HI>Hazle,</HI> the Shell is &s;ofter: Of the Kernel is made <HI>Chocolate,</HI> not much inferiour to that made of the <HI>Cacoa.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Peach</HI> Tree in incredible Numbers grows Wild: Of the Fruit expre&s;s'd, the Planters compo&s;e a plea&s;ant refre&s;hing Liquor; the Remainder of the Fruit &s;erves the Hogg and Cattle for Provi&s;ion. The <HI>Mulberry
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Tree</HI> every-where amid&s;t the Woods grows wild: The Planters, near their Plantations, in Rows and Walks, plant them for U&s;e, Ornament and Plea&s;ure: What I ob&s;erved of this Fruit was admirable; the Fruit there, was full and ripe in the latter end of <HI>April</HI> and beginning of <HI>May,</HI> whereas in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> they are not ripe before the lat|ter end of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> A Manufactory of Silk well encouraged might &s;oon be accompli&s;ht, con&s;idering the numerou&s;ne&s;s of the Leaf for Provi&s;ion, the clemency and moderatene&s;s of the Climate to indulge and nouri&s;h the Silk|worm: To make tryal of its Succe&s;s, was the Intention of tho&s;e <HI>French Prote&s;tant Pa&s;&s;engers</HI> tran&s;ported thither in His Maje&s;ties Frigat the <HI>Richmond</HI> being Forty Five the half of a greater Number de&s;ign'd for that place; but their De&s;ign was too early anticipated: the Eggs which they brought with them being hatch'd at Sea, before we could reach the Land, the Worms for want of Provi&s;ion were un|timely lo&s;t and de&s;troyed. The <HI>Olive Tree</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="7">
thrives there very well. Mr. <HI>James Colleton,</HI> Brother to Sir <HI>Peter,</HI> one of the Honourable Proprietors, brought an <HI>Olive Stick</HI> from <HI>Fy|all,</HI> (one of the <HI>We&s;tern</HI> I&s;lands) cut off at both Ends to <HI>Carolina,</HI> which put into the Ground, grew and pro&s;pered exceedingly; which gave &s;o great an Encouragement, that &s;ince I left the place, I hear that &s;everal more were brought there, there being great Hopes, that if the <HI>Olive</HI> be well improved, there may be expected from thence perhaps as good <HI>Oyl</HI> as any the World yields.</P>
<P><HI>Vines</HI> of divers &s;orts, bearing both Black and Gray <HI>Grapes,</HI> grow, climbing their high|e&s;t Trees, running and over-&s;preading their lower Bu&s;hes: Five Kinds they have alrea|dy di&s;tingui&s;h'd, three of which by <HI>Re-plan|tation,</HI> and if well cultivated, they own, will make very good <HI>Wine</HI>; &s;ome of which has been tran&s;ported for <HI>England,</HI> which by the be&s;t Pallates was well approved of, and more is daily expected, 'tis not doubted, if the <HI>Plan|ters</HI> as indu&s;triou&s;ly pro&s;ecute the <HI>Propagati|on</HI>

of <HI>Vineyards</HI> as they have begun; but <HI>Ca|rolina</HI> will in a little time prove a <HI>Magazine</HI> and <HI>Staple</HI> for <HI>Wines</HI> to the whole <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI>; and to enrich their Variety, &s;ome of the Pro|prietors and Planters have &s;ent them the No|ble&s;t and Excellente&s;t <HI>Vines</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> viz. the <HI>Rheni&s;h, Clarret,</HI> the <HI>Mu&s;cadel</HI> and <HI>Canary,</HI> &amp;c. His Maje&s;ty to, improve &s;o hopeful a De&s;ign, gave tho&s;e <HI>French</HI> we carried over their Pa&s;|&s;age free for them&s;elves, <HI>Wives, Children Goods</HI> and <HI>Servants,</HI> they being mo&s;t of them well experienced in the Nature of the <HI>Vine,</HI> from who&s;e Directions doubtle&s;s the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have received and made con&s;iderable Advantages in their Improvements.</P>
<P><HI>Trees</HI> for the Service of building Hou&s;es and Shipping, be&s;ides tho&s;e and many more which we have not nam'd; they have all &s;uch as we in <HI>England</HI> e&s;teem Good, La&s;ting, and Serviceable, as the <HI>Oak</HI> of three &s;orts, the <HI>White, Black</HI> and <HI>Live Oak,</HI> which for Toughne&s;s, and the Goodne&s;s of its Grain is much e&s;teemed: <HI>Elm, A&s;h, Beech,</HI> and <HI>Po|plar,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="8">
&amp;c Into the Nature, Qualities and Ver|tues of their Herbs, Roots and Flowers, we had little time to make any curious Enquiry: This we were a&s;&s;ured by many of the know|ing Planters, that they had Variety of &s;uch who&s;e <HI>Medicinal</HI> Vertues were rare and admi|rable. The <HI>China</HI> grows plentifully there, who&s;e Root infus'd, yields us that plea&s;ant Drink, which we know by the Name of <HI>Chi|na Ale</HI> in <HI>England</HI>: in <HI>Medicinal</HI> U&s;es it's far more excellent. Mon&s;ieur <HI>Tavernier,</HI> in his late Voyages to <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> ob&s;erves that Nation, by the frequent u&s;e of Water in which this Root is boyl'd, are never troubled with the Stone or Gout: It mundifies and &s;weetens the Blood: It's good in <HI>Fevers, Scurvy, Go|norrhaea,</HI> and the <HI>Lues Venerea.</HI> They have three &s;orts of the <HI>Rattle-Snake Root</HI> which I have &s;een; the <HI>Comous</HI> or <HI>Hairy,</HI> the <HI>Smooth,</HI> the <HI>No~dous,</HI> or <HI>Knotted</HI> Root: All which are lactiferous, or yielding a <HI>Milkie Juice</HI>; and if I do not very much in my Ob&s;ervations err, the Leaves of all the&s;e Roots of a Heart
<PB N="12" REF="9">
had the exact Re&s;emblance: They are all So|vereign again&s;t the Mortal Bites of that Snake, too frequent in the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI>: In all <HI>Pe&s;tilen|tial Di&s;tempers,</HI> as <HI>Plague, Small Pox,</HI> and <HI>Ma|lignant Fevers,</HI> it's a Noble <HI>Specifick</HI>; when &s;tung, they eat the Root, applying it to the Venemous Wound; or they boyl the Roots in Water; which drunk, fortifies and corro|borates the Heart, exciteing &s;trong and gene|rous Sweats; by which endangered Nature is relieved, and the Poy&s;on carried off, and expelled.</P>
<P><HI>Gardens</HI> as yet they have not much impro|ved or minded, their De&s;igns having other|wi&s;e more profitably engaged them in &s;ettling and cultivating their <HI>Plantations</HI> with good Provi&s;ions and numerous Stocks of Cattle; which two things by <HI>Planters</HI> are e&s;teemed the <HI>Ba&s;is</HI> and <HI>Props</HI> of all New <HI>Plantations</HI> and <HI>Settlements</HI>; before which be well accom|pli&s;hed and performed, nothing to any pur|po&s;e can be effected; and upon which all <HI>In|tentions, Manufactories,</HI> &amp;c. have their nece&s;|&s;ary

Dependance. But now their <HI>Gardens</HI> begin to be &s;upplied with &s;uch <HI>European Plants</HI> and <HI>Herbs</HI> as are nece&s;&s;ary for the Kitchen, <HI>viz. Potatoes, Lettice, Coleworts, Par&s;nip, Tur|nip, Carrot</HI> and <HI>Reddi&s;h</HI>: Their Gardens al&s;o begin to be beautified and adorned with &s;uch <HI>Herbs</HI> and <HI>Flowers</HI> which to the Smell or Eye are plea&s;ing and agreable, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Ro&s;e, Tu|lip, Carnation</HI> and <HI>Lilly.</HI> &amp;c. Their Provi&s;ion which grows in the Field is chiefly <HI>Indian</HI> Corn, which produces a va&s;t Increa&s;e, year|ly, yielding Two plentiful Harve&s;ts, of which they make whole&s;ome Bread, and good Bi&s;|ket, which gives a &s;trong, &s;ound, and nouri&s;h|ing Diet; with Milk I have eaten it dre&s;s'd various ways: Of the Juice of the Corn, when green, the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with <HI>Chocolet,</HI> aromatiz'd with <HI>Spices,</HI> make a rare Drink, of an excellent Delicacy. I have &s;een the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> among&s;t the <HI>Caribbes</HI> roa&s;t the green Ear on the Coals, and eat it with a great deal of Plea&s;ure: The <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>Carolina</HI> parch the ripe Corn, then pound it to a Pow|der,
<PB N="14" REF="10">
putting it in a Leathern Bag: When they u&s;e it, they take a little quantity of the Powder in the Palms of their Hands, mixing it with Water, and &s;up it off: with this they will travel &s;everal days. In &s;hort, it's a Grain of General U&s;e to Man and Bea&s;t, many thou&s;ands of both kinds in the <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> having from it the greater part of their Sub|&s;i&s;tence. The <HI>American Phy&s;icians</HI> ob&s;erve that it breeds good Blood, removes and o|pens <HI>Oppellations</HI> and <HI>Ob&s;tructions.</HI> At <HI>Caroli|na</HI> they have lately invented a way of make|ing with it good &s;ound Beer; but it's &s;trong and heady: By <HI>Maceration,</HI> when duly fer|mented, a &s;trong Spirit like <HI>Brandy</HI> may be drawn off from it, by the help of an <HI>Alembick.</HI></P>
<P>Pul&s;e they have of great Variety, not on|ly of what <HI>Europe</HI> yield, <HI>viz. Beans, Pea&s;e, Callavance, Figolaes,</HI> and <HI>Bonavi&s;t,</HI> &amp;c. but many other kinds proper to the place, and to us unknown: <HI>Green Pea&s;e</HI> at the latter end of <HI>April,</HI> at my being there, I eat as good as ever I did <HI>England. Strawberries Rasberries, Bill|berries,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="10">
and <HI>Blackberries</HI> grow frequently up and down the Woods. <HI>Hemp</HI> and <HI>Flax</HI> thrives exceeding well; there grows a &s;ort of wild Silk Pods, call'd <HI>Silk-Gra&s;s,</HI> of which they may make fine and durable Linnen.</P>
<P>What <HI>Wheat</HI> they have planted has been rather for Experiment and Ob&s;ervation, whe|ther it would be agreeable to the Soil and Climate, than for any &s;ub&s;tance for them&s;elves, or for Tran&s;portation abroad; what they have &s;own, the Planters a&s;&s;ured us grew ex|ceeding well; as al&s;o <HI>Barly,</HI> Mr. <HI>Linch</HI> an ingenious Planter, having whil&s;t we were there very good growing in his Plantation, of which he intended to make Malt for brewing of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Beer and Ale, having all Uten&s;ils and Conveniencies for it. <HI>Tobacco</HI> grows very well; and they have of an excellent &s;ort, mi&s;taken by &s;ome of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Smoakers for <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Tobacco, and valued from 5 to 8 <HI>s.</HI> the Pound; but finding a great deal of trouble in the Planting and Cure of it, and the great Quantities which <HI>Virginia,</HI> and other
<PB N="16" REF="11">
of His Maje&s;ties Plantations make, rendring it a Drug over all <HI>Europe</HI>; they do not much regard or encourage its Planting, having al|ready before them better and more profitable De&s;igns in Action. <HI>Tarr</HI> made of the re&s;inous Juice of the <HI>Pine</HI> (which boyl'd to a thicker Con&s;i&s;tence is Pitch) they make great quanti|ties yearly, tran&s;porting &s;everal Tuns to <HI>Barba|does, Jamaica,</HI> and the <HI>Caribbe</HI> I&s;lands. <HI>Indigo</HI> they have made, and that good: The rea|&s;on why they have de&s;i&s;ted I cannot learn. To conclude, there grows in <HI>Carolina</HI> the fa|mous <HI>Ca&s;&s;iny,</HI> who&s;e admirable and incompa|rable Vertues are highly applauded and ex|tolled by <HI>French</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Writers: It is the Leaves of a certain Tree, which boyl'd in Water (as we do <HI>Thea)</HI> wonder|fully enliven and envigorate the Heart, with genuine ea&s;ie <HI>Sweats</HI> and <HI>Tran|&s;pirations,</HI> pre&s;erving the Mind free and &s;erene, keeping the Body brisk, a|ctive, and lively, not for an hour, or two but for as many days, as tho&s;e Authors
