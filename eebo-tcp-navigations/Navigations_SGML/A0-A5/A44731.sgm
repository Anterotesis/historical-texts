<HEAD><HI>To</HI> the Renowned City of <HI>London. To the Right Honourable, Honourable, and all others,</HI> Who owe their fir&s;t Birth or wellbeing to &s;o Noble a Metropolis.</HEAD>
<P>IT was a notable Character, which <HI>Cornelius Tacitus,</HI> (that famous Regi&s;ter of Time, who had lived here many years) did give of <HI>London</HI> about fifteen hundred years agoe, <HI>Londinum copi&acirc; Negotiatorum, &amp; Comeatu maxim&egrave; celebre,</HI> London a mo&s;t renowned Mart for multi|tude of Marchants, and Commerce. If She de&s;erved &s;uch a Character in tho&s;e dayes, what would She merit now? who being compared to what &s;he was then, may be &s;aid, in point of magnitude, to be as a large Volume in Folio, to a Book <HI>in Decimo Sexto:</HI> And, in point of <HI>Trade,</HI> as in an Ea&s;t Indy <HI>Carack,</HI> to a Quinbourough <HI>Oy&s;ter ketch.</HI></P>
<P>I have read of &s;ome, who have bin enamor'd of <HI>Cities,</HI> as others u&s;e to be of <HI>Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es:</HI> &s;o <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperor, was &s;truck with the love of <HI>Flo|rence,</HI> when among other expre&s;sions he &s;aid, <HI>That &s;he was a fair Lady, fit to be &s;een only on Holidayes;</HI> So a French Baron was &s;o taken with the City of <HI>Paris,</HI> (which is known to be none of the <HI>neate&s;t)</HI> that he &s;aid, <HI>Could he live ever in</HI> Paris, <HI>he would quit his right to</HI> Paradi&s;e. And it is &s;toried of <HI>Tamberlain,</HI> that having got <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the fir&s;t Com|plement he put upon Her, was, <HI>that he had heard &s;o much of Her rare beauty, that He came from &s;o far off to Court Her;</HI> but an&s;wer was made, that it was the Cu&s;tom of <HI>Thrace,</HI> to Court fair Ladies, not with <HI>Trum|pets</HI> and <HI>Drums,</HI> but with <HI>Dulcimers,</HI> and other melodious In&s;truments.</P>
<P>I may well affirm, that <HI>London</HI> is not inferior to any of the&s;e, as will appear in a <HI>Parallel</HI> hereunto annexed: And having breath'd Air, and (lept in her bo&s;om, now near upon forty years (except the times that I was a|broad upon forren Employments,) it is no wonder, if I be <HI>habitually</HI> in love with Her; nor have I bin wanting to expre&s;s it many times by dedicating unto Her the great <HI>French</HI> Dictionary refin'd, and enrich'd with divers Additionals; Then in giving Her &s;ome warnings by the &s;ad de&s;tiny of <HI>Je|ru&s;alem,</HI> in an Epitome that goes of <HI>Jo&s;ephus;</HI> I &s;hewed my &s;elf al&s;o very &s;en&s;ible of Her ca&s;e at that time, when I addre&s;sd unto Her <HI>Englands Teares,</HI> and <HI>Mercurius Acheronticus.</HI> nor is it long &s;ince, that I made publick love to <HI>Venice,</HI> and Courted <HI>Naples</HI> al&s;o, and I came off with no ill &s;ucce&s;s; I hope to do the like here.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
I know others have treated already of the &s;ame Subject, and given a lau|dible account of the City of <HI>London,</HI> but Gold may be often told over with|out fouling the &s;ingers. I have read near upon a dozen &s;everal Survayes of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Venice,</HI> with other Cities, and I alwayes found new Ob&s;erva|tions; But it is now above thirty foure years agoe, (which are near upon five Ages in the Law) &s;ince any thing was written of <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI> her collateral Si&s;ter; which tract of time, a&s;&s;ords variety of accidents, which the Reader &s;hall find in this new Account: wherein as I have bin care|ful not to pretermit any thing thats <HI>Material,</HI> &s;o my &s;pecial Caution hath bin not to thru&s;t in any frivolous pedantick things, or <HI>Superfluities,</HI> where|unto my nature hath bin alwayes aver&s;e; Moreover, I promi&s;e the Reader, that he &s;hall meet with many other Ob&s;ervations here, which were never yet drawn off the Pre&s;se, or expo&s;ed to publick light until now.</P>
<P>I will conclude my Epi&s;tle with this Que&s;tion, If it was e&s;teemed an honour among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> to be born in <HI>Athens;</HI> If among the <HI>Italians,</HI> to be a <HI>Roman;</HI> If among the <HI>Spaniards</HI> to be a <HI>Toledano:</HI> why &s;hould it be le&s;&s;e honour for an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> to be born in <HI>London?</HI></P>
<P>My hearty prayers to Heaven are, for the incolumity, and welfare of this Great City, for the aver&s;ion of all Judgements, and that &s;he may &s;till flouri&s;h with affluence of all Earthly felicity; by which prayer I &s;ub&s;cribe my &s;elf,</P>

<HEAD>SOME <HI>ADVERTISEMENTS</HI> TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>THey who make re&s;earches into <HI>Antiquity,</HI> may be &s;aid to pa&s;&s;e often through many <HI>dark Lobbies,</HI> and du&s;ky places, before they come to <HI>Aula lucis,</HI> the Great Hall of light; They mu&s;t repair to old <HI>Archives,</HI> and peru&s;e many mouldred and moth|eaten Records, and &s;o bring light as it were out of darkne&s;s, to inform the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> World, what the <HI>former</HI> did, and make us &s;ee truth through our <HI>Ance&s;tors</HI> eyes. Now, though we commonly term <HI>Them</HI> that went before us our <HI>Ance&s;tors,</HI> yet if we have re&s;pect to the extent of <HI>Time,</HI> and the <HI>Age</HI> of the World, <HI>We</HI> who live now, may be called the more <HI>Ancient;</HI> For <HI>They</HI> lived; &s;ome of them in the <HI>Non-age,</HI> &s;ome in the <HI>Youth,</HI> &s;ome in the <HI>Adole&s;cence,</HI> &s;ome in the <HI>virility</HI> of the World, And <HI>We</HI> who now crawl up and down the earth, may be &s;aid to live in the declining and <HI>doting old decrepit Age:</HI> Therefore if relation be had to true <HI>longaevity, We</HI> may be rather called the <HI>Older:</HI> In&s;omuch, that a Child born to day, as he is part of the Univer&s;e, and the pro|duct of Time, may be &s;aid to be more ancient then <HI>Adam,</HI> which I con|ceive to be the meaning of that common &s;aying among us, <HI>The youn|ger Brother is the ancienter Gentleman.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, it is de&s;ired, that the <HI>di&s;cerning</HI> Reader be advertized, that Hi&s;torians and <HI>Antiquaries,</HI> may well be compared to <HI>Architects,</HI> who in rearing up a Fabrick, although the <HI>Idaea,</HI> and de&s;ign of the work, with the &s;ite, the contrivement of rooms, the contignation of parts and Symmetry, be wholly in them&s;elves; yet in point of <HI>Sub&s;tance,</HI> they fetch their <HI>Materials</HI> from el&s;e where; &s;o the <HI>Hi&s;torian</HI> and <HI>Antiquary,</HI> though the method, the &s;tyle, and compilement be his, yet he hath his matter from others, either from Manu&s;cripts, or printed Records, except the&s;e modern pa&s;&s;ages that are <HI>Synchronical</HI> with him&s;elf. Furthermore, an <HI>Hi&s;torian</HI> may be compared to one walking in a Garden, and making a po&s;ie of Flowers, which he culs and plucks from divers beds and banks; now, though the Flowers be none of his, yet the choyce of them, and twi&s;ting them together, to give the fuller fragrancy, and not to thru&s;t in any un&s;avory vegetal, is &s;olely his own work.</P>
<P>The Lord <HI>Bacon</HI>'s <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, and my Lord <HI>Harbert</HI>'s <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, though the compo&s;ition, and dige&s;ting be theirs, whereby they <HI>denominate</HI> the Books, yet, under favour, touching the main <HI>In|gredients,</HI> they took them from others, who had written the life of

<P>IT is as difficult a task to finde out the Original of &s;ome Nations and <HI>Cit|ties,</HI> as it is to finde out the Spring of the <HI>my&s;terious</HI> River of <HI>Nile;</HI> which tumbling down with a horrid noi&s;e of Cataracts through &s;o many huge Rocks, above two thou&s;and miles, comes punctually every Summer <HI>&s;ol&s;tice,</HI> to vi&s;it the <HI>gran Cairo;</HI> and then takes her leave of Her, as <HI>punctually</HI> the <HI>Autum|nal Equinox</HI> next following, having fir&s;t impregnared the hot womb of <HI>Egypt,</HI> with a wonderful <HI>prolificall</HI> vertue, for the generation of &s;o many &s;pecies of A|nimalls, and Vegetalls.</P>
<P>But to finde out the <HI>Original</HI> of the City of <HI>London,</HI> 'tis not &s;o hard a matter; yet, there are variety of Opinions hereof, which we will briefly examine; <HI>Piolomy, Tacitus,</HI> and <HI>Antonine,</HI> call her &s;ometimes <HI>Londinium,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>Longidinium. Ammianus Mar&s;ellinus,</HI> calls her <HI>Lundinum,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>Augusta,</HI> which is, <HI>the &s;tately and magnificent City.</HI> There are &s;ome who call Her <HI>Troia nova,</HI> or <HI>Troynovant;</HI> which appellation, <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, in that famous long Letter he writ to Pope <HI>Boniface,</HI> about the <HI>Scots Nation,</HI> &s;eemes to a&s;&s;ert: Others call her <HI>Caer Lud,</HI> other <HI>Dinas Belin;</HI> But that Opinion which quadrats mo&s;t with truth, is, that her fir&s;t Founders, and Godfathers, were the ancient Britains, (whom we now call Wel&s;h) who by confe&s;&s;ion of all Antiquaries, both dome&s;tick and forraign, were the <HI>Aborigenes,</HI> and fir&s;t Inhabitants of this Countrey, being contemporary, and as it were <HI>concreated</HI> with the <HI>Iland</HI> her &s;elf; There are three denominations, which are derived from the Britans, viz. <HI>Llhogdin; Llhwndian,</HI> and <HI>Llhandian,</HI> which we &s;hall endeavour to explane; Touching the fir&s;t, the <HI>Britans</HI> call a &s;hip <HI>Llhong,</HI> and <HI>Dinan</HI> a Town. In&s;omuch, that <HI>Llongdin</HI> is no other then <HI>Shipton,</HI> or <HI>a Town of Ships;</HI> And I have read of many Cities, who derive their names from Ships, as <HI>Nanpactum, Nauplia, Naua|lia Augu&s;ti, Nauctathmos;</HI> But none of the&s;e hath more right to a&s;&s;ume the Title of <HI>Shipton,</HI> or <HI>Llhongdin</HI> (according to the Briti&s;h) as the City of <HI>London</HI> hath, in regard that &s;he is &s;ituated, upon the gentle a&s;cent, or flank of a Hill hard by a dainty <HI>Navigable River,</HI> which &s;welling at certain &s;et houres with the O|cean Tides, &s;he is able by her deep, and &s;afe Channel to entertain the greate&s;t bottoms and Ships, that can ride on Neptunes back, which makes Her &s;o famous a Mart, tho&s;e Ships bringing in all the rich Commodities that the VVorld can afford; whereunto alludes old <HI>Robert</HI> of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> in the Rimes of tho&s;e dayes, which I thought worthy to in&s;ert here for the Antiquity of the Dialect.</P>

<P>Touching the &s;econd <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> appellation <HI>Llhwndian, Cae&s;ar,</HI> and <HI>Strabo,</HI> do mention that the ancient <HI>Britans</HI> called tho&s;e Woods or Groves, which they had barrocadoed and fenc'd about with Trees ca&s;t down, and pla&s;h'd, to prevent
<PB N="3" REF="9">
all inrodes and a&s;&s;aults, they call'd &s;uch a place I &s;ay <HI>Llhwn,</HI> which is equivalent to a <HI>fenc'd Town,</HI> or dwelling, as the Poet &s;ings of them.</P>
<LG>
<L>&mdash;Their Hou&s;es were the Thicks,</L>
<L>And bu&s;hy queaches hollow Caves, and Hardles made of &s;ticks.</L>
</LG>
<P>And 'tis more then probable, that in that place, where St. <HI>Pauls</HI> Church now &s;tands, there was a <HI>Wood</HI> or Grove at fir&s;t, in regard there was a <HI>Fane</HI> or <HI>Temple</HI> erected there to the honour of <HI>Diana;</HI> for Hi&s;torians ob&s;erve, that whereas <HI>Ve|nus, Mars,</HI> and <HI>Vulcan</HI> were u&s;ed to have their Temples in the <HI>Suburbs, Ju|piter</HI> and <HI>Apollo</HI> within the City, the Godde&s;s <HI>Diana</HI> was u&s;ed to have her Temples &s;et up in <HI>Woods,</HI> which might make the Britains denominate that place <HI>Llhwndian,</HI> which is as much as <HI>Diana's Grove or Town.</HI></P>
<P>As this derivation carrieth a great &s;emblance of truth with it, &s;o the third, viz. <HI>Llhandian</HI> carrieth as much, if not a greater veri&s;imilitude, and weighs mo&s;t with me; The <HI>Brittains</HI> to this day, call a Church or Temple <HI>Llhan,</HI> whereof there be a great number in <HI>Wales</HI> to this day, as <HI>Llhangor&s;e, Llhan&s;awel, Llhan|dilo &amp;c.</HI> which &s;ignifieth the <HI>Churches</HI> of &s;uch <HI>places;</HI> And whereas by the Cur|rent and con&s;entient opinion of all Antiquaries, there was a Pagan Temple, or Fane erected to <HI>Diana,</HI> in that place where now St. <HI>Paul's</HI> &s;tands, there being yet there a place called <HI>Camera Dianae,</HI> where Oxe heads and bones are daily found, which were u&s;ed to be offered her as victims and &s;acrifices, I &s;ay, 'tis more then probable, that the <HI>Britains</HI> were induc'd thereby to call the place <HI>Nhandian,</HI> which is the <HI>Temple of Diana;</HI> and &s;o in <HI>tract</HI> of time, the word was <HI>contracted,</HI> and came to be called <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Now, who was the fir&s;t <HI>Founder</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> is no where preci&s;ely found. But who&s;oever fir&s;t founded her, they &s;hewed much prudence in the choyce of &s;ci|tuation; For the happy and fortunate E&s;tate of the City, hath given good proof, that built &s;he was in a good houre, when &s;ome propitious Starre was then the a&s;cendent, and marked for long life and continuance, and that &s;he is for anti|quity very honourable; <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> giveth us to under&s;tand, that &s;he was called an <HI>ancient</HI> City in his time, which is above twelve hundred years agoe; <HI>Cornelius Tacitus</HI> doth &s;eem to do the like three hundred years before, who gives her this Character, <HI>Londinum copi&acirc; Negotiatorum, &amp; commeatu vald&egrave; celebre</HI> for multitude of Merchants, and commerce, <HI>London</HI> is very renowned: This only was wanting to the glory thereof, that &s;he had not the name of <HI>Free City,</HI> nor of Colony; Neither indeed had it &s;tood with the Roman intere&s;t, if any City flouri&s;hing with Trade, &s;hould have enjoyed the right of a <HI>Free City;</HI> And therefore it was, as may be well &s;uppo&s;ed, that they ordain'd her to be a <HI>Pre|fecture,</HI> for &s;o they term'd Towns where <HI>Marts</HI> were kept, and Ju&s;tice admini|&s;tred, yet &s;o that they had no Magi&s;trates of their own, but rulers were &s;ent eve|ry year to govern them, and for to execute Law in publick matters, namely of Tax, Tribute, Tolls, Cu&s;toms, Warfare, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from the <HI>Senate of Rome;</HI> Hence it commeth, that <HI>Tacitus</HI> the Panegyri&s;t, and <HI>Marcellinus</HI> afore&s;aid, call her only a <HI>Town;</HI> But although &s;he was not lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">tier in name, yet in Wealth, Riches, and Pro&s;perity, &s;he flouri&s;hed as much as any other, yea and continued alwayes the &s;ame, under the Dominions of <HI>Romans, Saxons,</HI> and <HI>Normans,</HI> &s;eldom or never afflicted with any great calamities. In the raign of <HI>Nero,</HI> when the <HI>Britains</HI> had con&s;pired to recover, and re&s;ume their liberty, under the Conduct of <HI>Baeodicia,</HI> the <HI>Londoners</HI> could not with all their vveepings hold <HI>Suetonius Paulinus,</HI> but that after he had leavied a power of the Citizens to ayd him, he would needes di&s;lodge, and remove from thence, leaving the City naked to the Enemy, who forth with &s;urprized and &s;lew &s;ome few, whom either weakne&s;s of Sex, feeble|ne&s;s of age, or &s;weetne&s;s of the place had detained there: Neither had &s;he &s;u|&s;tained le&s;&s;e lo&s;&s;e, and mi&s;ery, at the hands of the <HI>Gaules,</HI> if &s;he had not &s;udden|ly, and beyond all expectation by Gods providence bin relieved; For when C.
<PB N="4" REF="10">
<HI>Alectus</HI> had by a deceitful &s;tratagem, made away <HI>Carau&s;ius,</HI> who taking advan|tage of our rough Seas, and of <HI>Diocle&s;ians</HI> dangerous Warres in the Ea&s;t, and withall, pre&s;uming of the <HI>Gauls,</HI> (now <HI>French)</HI> and mo&s;t venturous Marriners, and Servi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ors at Sea, withheld to him&s;elf the Revenues of <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and born for the &s;pace of &s;ix years, the Title of <HI>Emperour Augu&s;tus,</HI> as his Coines here very oft do &s;hew: When M. <HI>Aurelius A&s;clepiedotus</HI> had in a Battail &s;lain <HI>Alectus</HI> in the third year now of his U&s;urpation of the Imperial Purple and State, tho&s;e <HI>French</HI> who remained alive after the Battle ha&s;tening to <HI>London,</HI> would have &s;ack'd the City, had not the <HI>Thames,</HI> who never fail'd to help the <HI>Londoners,</HI> very opportunely brought in the Roman Legions, who by rea&s;on of a Fog at Sea, were &s;evered from the Navy: For they put the <HI>Barbarians</HI> to the Sword, all the City over, and thereby gave the Citizens, not only &s;afety by the &s;laughter of their Enemies, but plea&s;ure in beholding &s;uch a &s;ight; And then it was, as our Chronicles record that <HI>Lucius Gallus</HI> was &s;lain by a Brook &s;ide, which ran almo&s;t through the middle of the City, and of him was called by the Bri|ti&s;h <HI>Nantgall,</HI> in Engli&s;h <HI>Wallbrook;</HI> which name remains yet in a Street, un|der which there is a &s;ewer within the ground, to rid away the filth, and ordures of the City, Not far from <HI>London-&s;tone,</HI> which I take to be a <HI>Mile-mark</HI> or <HI>Mil|liary,</HI> &s;uch as was in the Market places at Roms, from which were taken dimen|&s;ions of all journies, every way, con&s;idering it is neer the mid&s;t of the City, as it lyeth in length. Neither is it probable, &s;he was yet wall'd about; But a little after our Stories report, that <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Great, at the in&s;tance of his Mo|ther <HI>Helena,</HI> did fir&s;t fence her about with a Wall made of rough &s;tone, and Bri|ti&s;h Bricks, which took up in compa&s;&s;e, above three miles, &s;o that it inclo&s;ed the Model of the City almo&s;t four-&s;quare, but not equal on every &s;ide, con&s;idering, that from <HI>East</HI> to <HI>VVe&s;t,</HI> &s;he is far longer then from <HI>South</HI> to <HI>North.</HI> That part of this Wall which &s;tood on the <HI>Thames</HI> &s;ide, is by the continual flowing, and wa&s;hings of the River fallen down and decayed; yet there appear'd certain re|mains thereof in <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econds time, as <HI>Fitz&s;tephen,</HI> who then liv'd doth te&s;tifie. The re&s;t now &s;tanding, is &s;tronger towards the <HI>North,</HI> which not ma|ny years &s;ince, was reedified by the meanes of <HI>Joceline,</HI> Lord Mayor of <HI>London;</HI> But towards <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>VVe&s;t,</HI> although the <HI>Barons</HI> in old time, during their Warres, repaired and renewed it with the ruynes of the <HI>Jewes</HI> hou&s;es then de|moli&s;hed, yet it grew quickly, all thorow, out of decay; For <HI>Londoners</HI> like to tho&s;e old <HI>Lacedemonians,</HI> laughed at &s;trong walled Towns, as <HI>Cot-hou&s;es for Wo|men,</HI> thinking their own Cities &s;ufficiently fenc'd, when they are fortified with <HI>bones,</HI> and not with <HI>&s;tones.</HI></P>
<P>This Wall giveth entrance at &s;even principal double Gates; for I willingly omit the &s;maller, which as they have bin lately repaired, &s;o they have al&s;o new names given them;</P>
<P>On the <HI>We&s;t</HI> &s;ide there be two, to wit, <HI>Ludgate</HI> of King <HI>Lud</HI> a <HI>Britain,</HI> or <HI>Flud-gate,</HI> as <HI>Leland</HI> is of opinion, of a little flud running beneath it, like as the Gate <HI>Fluentana</HI> in Rome, built again from the foundation; This Gate was made a free Pri&s;on, <HI>Anno 1378, Bremer</HI> being Major, which was con|firm'd 1382. by a Common Councel in the <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> where 'twas ordained, that all Freemen of <HI>London</HI> &s;hould for debts, tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, accounts, and con|tempts, be impri&s;oned in <HI>Ludgate,</HI> where at fir&s;t for lodging and water, they did not pay anything. We go next to <HI>Newgate,</HI> the faire&s;t of all the Gates &s;o call'd from the newne&s;s thereof, whereas before it was call'd <HI>Chamberlane Gate,</HI> which now is the publick Gaol or Pri&s;on for Criminalls; and al&s;o for civil actions, for the Country of <HI>Middle&s;ex.</HI> And it hath bin &s;o many Ages, as appears by Records in King <HI>Johns</HI> time; as al&s;o in King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, who (as an old Authour te&s;tifieth) &s;ent a Command to the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> to repair the Goal of <HI>New|gate.</HI></P>
<P>On the North &s;ide are four Gates, viz. <HI>Alder&s;gate,</HI> or <HI>Older&s;gate</HI> from the
<PB N="5" REF="10">
antiquity thereof, or as others would have it from <HI>Aldrich</HI> a <HI>Saxon;</HI> the &s;e|cond is <HI>Cripplegate</HI> of a Spitle of Cripples &s;ometimes adjoyning thereunto: The third is <HI>Mooregate,</HI> call'd &s;o of a <HI>Moory</HI> ground hard by, which is now draind up, and made fair and firm, and turn'd into a field &amp; delightful walks. Which Gate was fir&s;t built by <HI>Falconer</HI> Lord Mayor, in the year of our Lord 1414. Then <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate</HI> of a Bi&s;hop the Benefactor; which Gate the <HI>Dutch</HI> Mar|chants, or <HI>Hans</HI> of the <HI>Styliard</HI> were bound by Covenant both to repair, and de|fend at all times of danger and extremity.</P>
<P>On the Ea&s;t &s;ide there is <HI>Aldgate,</HI> &s;o named from the oldne&s;&s;e, or <HI>Elbegate</HI> as others terme it, which hath bin oft re-edified; It is thought, that two Gates more &s;tood, be&s;ides the Bridge gate, by the Thames &s;ide, namely <HI>Belin&s;gate,</HI> now a Wharfe or a Key for the <HI>Scots</HI> Trade; and <HI>Douregate</HI> or the Watergate, com|monly call'd <HI>Dowgate.</HI></P>
<P>There be &s;ome <HI>Po&s;terns</HI> be&s;ides that may go for Gates, as that of <HI>Chri&s;ts Ho|&s;pital,</HI> which was made in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth; Another was made out of the wall lately into Moorfields. But the <HI>Po&s;tern</HI> by the <HI>Tower</HI> &s;hews that it hath bin very ancient, and an arch'd Gate of much tru&s;t; for in times pa&s;t there was alwaies a per&s;on of quality who was <HI>Cu&s;tos</HI> of that <HI>Posterne.</HI> To|wards the Rivers &s;ide, there are al&s;o many water gates for the better &s;ecurity of the City.</P>
<P>Where the wall endeth towards the River, there were two &s;trong Forts or Ba&s;tions, of which the one Ea&s;tward remaineth yet, u&s;ually called the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> called in the old Briti&s;h <HI>Bringwin,</HI> or <HI>Tourgwin,</HI> which in Engli&s;h is, the White Tower; a mo&s;t famous and goodly Cittadel encompa&s;&s;ed about with thick and &s;trong Walls, full of lofty, and &s;tately Turrets, fenc'd about with a broad and a deep ditch, furni&s;h'd al&s;o with an Armory or Magazine of Warlick munition, with other buildings be&s;ides, &s;o that it re&s;embleth a Town of it &s;elf; and one may well &s;uppo&s;e, that tho&s;e two Ca&s;tles which <HI>Fitz-&s;tephens</HI> re|cordeth to have bin on the <HI>Ea&s;t &s;ide</HI> of this City, went both to the making of this one: The other Fort was on the <HI>We&s;t &s;ide</HI> of this City, where <HI>Fleet</HI> a little riveret ran, whence <HI>Fleet&s;treet</HI> took its name, and in time, it was able to bear Ve&s;&s;els, as appears in &s;ome Parliament Rolls, which Riveret di&s;chargeth it &s;elf into the <HI>Thames. Fitz Stephen</HI> calls this the <HI>Palatin</HI> Tower or Ca&s;tle; And they write, that in the Reign of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror, it was con&s;umed by fire, out of the ruines whereof a great part of Saint <HI>Pauls</HI> Church, was newly built; And al&s;o on the very plot of ground where it &s;tood, <HI>Robert Kilwarby</HI> ArchBi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> founded a Religious Hou&s;e for the <HI>Dominican</HI> Fryars, whence we call the place <HI>Black-fryars;</HI> whereby a man may ea&s;ily gue&s;s of what bigne&s;s it was; howbeit, in that place, &s;tood in the dayes of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd <HI>(Gerva&s;e</HI> of <HI>Tilbury</HI> in his Book call'd <HI>Otia Imperialia</HI> is my Author) two Forts or Ram|parts, the one whereof belong'd to <HI>Bainard,</HI> the other to the <HI>Baron of Mon|fichet</HI> by right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but nothing remaineth of them to this day; yet &s;ome think that <HI>Pembroke</HI> Hou&s;e was a piece of them, which we term <HI>Bainards Ca&s;tle,</HI> of <HI>Bainard</HI> a noble man of <HI>Dunmow,</HI> who&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;ometimes it was, &amp; who&s;e Succe&s;&s;ors the <HI>Fitz Waters</HI> were in right of inheritance, who were <HI>En|&s;ign-bearers</HI> of the City of <HI>London,</HI> (as &s;hall be told hereafter) and among them <HI>Robert Fitz water,</HI> had licence of K. <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, to &s;ell the Site of <HI>Bainards</HI> Ca&s;tle to the forenamed ArchBi&s;hop <HI>Kilwarby.</HI> Neither was this City at that time <HI>wall'd</HI> only, but al&s;o when the <HI>Flamins</HI> or Pagan Prie&s;ts were taken away, and <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Religion e&s;tabli&s;hed under that good Emperour <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> a Bi|&s;hop was in&s;tall'd in their room, for it appeareth at the Councel of <HI>Arles,</HI> which in the year of grace 314 was held under the &s;aid <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the great, the <HI>Bi&s;hop of London</HI> was pre&s;ent; for he &s;ub&s;cribed, as it is to be &s;een in the fir&s;t Tome of the Councel in this manner. <HI>Re&s;titutus, Bi&s;hop in the City of London

<P>From that time, <HI>London</HI> flouri&s;hed in &s;uch honour, that &s;he began to be call'd <HI>Augu&s;ta,</HI> and by that name was famous under the Emperour <HI>Valentinian;</HI> For <HI>Ammianus Marcellinus</HI> in his 27 Book writeth thus, <HI>And going forward to London an ancient Town which po&s;terity call'd Augu&s;ta:</HI> and in the 28 Book, He went from <HI>Augu&s;ta,</HI> which men of old time call'd <HI>London;</HI> Whence it came that after <HI>Con&s;tantine's</HI> time, there was a <HI>Mint</HI> appointed therein; For we read in tho&s;e Pieces of Money, which he cau&s;ed to be &s;tamp'd in honour of his Fa|ther <HI>Con&s;tantius,</HI> and in others; this was the In&s;cription, <HI>P.

For this name <HI>Augu&s;ta</HI> was a name full of Dignity and Maje&s;ty; And both Founders and Repairers of Cities, when they hoped or wi&s;h'd, that &s;uch Cities would become flouri&s;hing and powerful, gave them &s;ignificant names of good fortune; But among the mo&s;t au&s;picious names that be, none is more magnificent, none more au&s;picate and glorious than <HI>Augu&s;ta.</HI> For, this of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> the mo&s;t gracious &amp; mighty Emperour <HI>Octavianus</HI> took unto him&s;elf, not without the judgment of the be&s;t learned. Sirnamed he was, &s;aith <HI>Dio, Augustus</HI> as one of great Maje&s;ty above the nature of man: for what things be mo&s;t honourable and &s;acred, are called <HI>Augu&s;ta:</HI> Neither had <HI>London</HI> this name for &s;o high an honour, without the Licence of the Roman Emperours; In regard that names could not be im|pos'd upon Cities without authority, as <HI>Virgil</HI> notes in that ver&s;e of his;</P>

At la&s;t, courage and re&s;olution, with a love to the publique good met in the brea&s;t of the Adventurer, and &s;pur'd him on to &s;o glo|rious an enterpri&s;e, which hath proved &s;o happily commodious, and of &s;uch infinite utility to the whole City, that had he lived under &s;ome other Meridians, that I know, he &s;hould have had his Statue erected in the eminente&s;t place of the City, to eternize his name &amp; tran&s;mit his memory, and keep it fre&s;h (like his waters) to all future Ages; Now as Mr. <HI>Stow</HI> &s;peaks very ingeniou&s;ly, if tho&s;e ene|mies to all good actions, Danger, difficulty detraction, contempt, &s;corn, &amp; envy, could have prevail'd by their malevolent interpo&s;ition, either before, at the be|ginning, and in the very birth of the attempt, and a good while after; this work had never bin accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>'Tis true, Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> gave way, by act of Parliament, to her Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> and power for cutting and conveying of a River from any part of <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> or <HI>Hartford&s;hire</HI> into the City of <HI>London,</HI> with a limitation of ten years time for the performance thereof; but that Enterprize expir'd with her life: King <HI>James</HI> her immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;or, did grant the like, but without|date of time for the &s;ame effect; And when the courage of others were quite quail'd, and utterly refu&s;ed the bu&s;ine&s;s, Sir <HI>Hugh Middleton</HI> did undertake it, and &s;o with infinite pains, and no le&s;&s;e expence, he fini&s;h'd the work, by bring|ing a River of whol&s;om fine chearful water from <HI>Chadwel</HI> and <HI>Amwel,</HI> to the North &s;ide of <HI>London,</HI> near <HI>I&s;lington,</HI> where he built a large Ci&s;tern to receive it. The work began the 28. day of February, <HI>Anno Dom.</HI> 1608. and in the compa&s;s of five years was fully compleated. Touching the Aquaeduct, or the convey|ance thereof to <HI>London,</HI> it hardly can be imagined, what difficulties and rubs there were in the way, by rea&s;on of the various qualities of grounds, through which the water was to pa&s;&s;e; &s;ome being ozie, &s;oft, and muddy; others again as &s;tiffe, and craggy; The depth of the Trench in &s;ome places de&s;cended full thirty foot and more, whereas in other places, it required as much artifice, to mount it over a valley in troughs betwixt Hills, and tho&s;e troughs to be &s;up|ported by woodden Arches, &s;ome of them fix'd in the Earth very deep, and ri|&s;ing in height above 23. foot. Being brought to the fore&s;aid great Ce&s;tern, the water was not yet let in, till on Michaelmas day, <HI>Anno</HI> 1613. being the day that Sir <HI>Thomas Middleton,</HI> Brother to the &s;aid <HI>Sir Hugh,</HI> was elected Lord Maior of <HI>London</HI> for the year en&s;uing. In the afternoon of the &s;ame day, Sir <HI>John Swinerton,</HI> then Lord Maior, accompanied with the &s;aid Sir <HI>Thomas,</HI> Sir <HI>Henry Mountague,</HI> Recorder of <HI>London,</HI> and many of the worthy Aldermen, rode in a &s;olemn manner, to &s;ee the great Ce&s;tern, and fir&s;t i&s;&s;uing of the &s;trange River thereunto, which then was made free Denizon of <HI>London,</HI> and the Solemnity was thus. A Troop of Labourers to the number of three&s;core, or more, well apparell'd, and wearing green Monmouth Caps, after the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> manner, all alike, carried Spades, Shovels, Pickaxes, and &s;uch like In&s;truments of laborious Employment, and marching after Drums, twice or thrice about the Ci&s;tern, pre&s;ented them&s;elves before the Mount, where the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen were, where after a hand&s;ome &s;peech, the Flud-gates flew open, the &s;tream ran chearfully into the Ci&s;tern, the Drums and Trumpets &s;ounding in triumphant manner, and a gallant peal of Chambers gave a Period to the en|tertainment. A noble achievement it was, as this reracted to Sir <HI>Hugh Mid|dleton,</HI> doth partly &s;et forth, which never &s;aw publique light until now.</P>

Having accompanied our gentle, and &s;mooth-gliding River now to <HI>London,</HI> &s;he now makes great ha&s;te to meet with Neptune her lovely husband; the fir&s;t water &s;he greets is the <HI>Brome,</HI> on <HI>Kent</HI> &s;ide, We&s;t of <HI>Greenwich;</HI> who&s;e &s;pring is <HI>Bromis</HI> in <HI>Bromley</HI> Pari&s;h, and &s;o goeth thence to <HI>Lew&s;ham</HI> taking water from the Ea&s;t: The next water &s;he meets withal, is on <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> &s;ide, almo&s;t again&s;t <HI>Woolwich,</HI> and that is the <HI>Lee;</HI> And being pa&s;s'd that, the <HI>Darwent</HI> al&s;o di&s;char|geth her &s;elf into the <HI>Thames</HI> on <HI>Kent</HI> &s;ide, two miles and more beneath <HI>Erith</HI> having its ri&s;ing at <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> or <HI>Tanridge.</HI></P>
<P>The next River that di&s;gorgeth her &s;elf into the <HI>Thames,</HI> is We&s;t of the <HI>Wam I &s;les,</HI> a rill of no great note, or long cour&s;e; for ri&s;ing about <HI>Coringham</HI> it runs not many miles Ea&s;t and by South, till it falls into the mouth of this River; La&s;t of all the <HI>Thames</HI> takes acquaintance, and mingleth with <HI>Medway</HI> a con&s;i|derable River watering all the South parts of <HI>Kent.</HI></P>
<P>This noble navigable River flows, and fills all her Channels twice ev'ry natu|ral day, by the flux and reflux of the Sea, which holdeth on for the &s;pace of 70 miles within the main Land; the &s;tream or tyde being highe&s;t at <HI>London,</HI> when the Moon doth exactly touch the North-ea&s;t, and South or We&s;t points of the Heavens, whereof one is vi&s;ible, the other underneath us: The&s;e tydes do al&s;o differ in their times, each one coming later than the other by &s;o many mi|nutes as pa&s;&s;e; yet the revolution and natural cour&s;e of the Heavens, do reduce and bring about the &s;aid Planet to the&s;e her former places, whereby the com|mon difference 'twixt one tyde and another, is found to con&s;i&s;t of 24 minutes, which wanteth but twelve of a whole hour in 24 as experience doth confirm; In like manner we daily find, that each tyde is not of equal heighth and fulne&s;s; For at the Full and the Change of the Moon, we have the highe&s;t flouds, and &s;uch is their extraordinary cour&s;e that as they dimini&s;h from their Changes and Fulls, unto their fir&s;t and la&s;t Quarters, &s;o afterwards, they encrea&s;e again until they come to the Full and Change; &s;ometimes they ri&s;e al&s;o &s;o high, e&s;pe|cially if the wind be at the North or North-ea&s;t, which brings in the water with more vehemency, becau&s;e the tyde which fills the Channel cometh Northward, that the <HI>Thames</HI> often inounds the bankes about <HI>London,</HI> which happeneth mo&s;t frequently in <HI>January</HI> and <HI>February,</HI> which makes the grounds afterwards more fertile. Neither do the tydes alter a whit, unle&s;&s;e &s;ome im|petuous winds from the We&s;t or South-we&s;t, do keep back and check the &s;tream, as the Ea&s;t and North-Ea&s;t do ha&s;ten the coming in thereof: or el&s;e &s;ome other extraordinary occa&s;ion put by the cour&s;e of the German Seas, which do fill the River by their natural return, and flowings; And the probable&s;t rea&s;on why three or four tydes do chop in in one day is, becau&s;e the winds blowing more &s;trong than ordinarily North or North-ea&s;t, make the Sea to ru&s;h in with more &s;peed, and abundance of water.</P>
<P>The Land &s;treams or white waters, do oftentimes thicken the finene&s;&s;e of the River, in &s;o much that after a Land floud, 'tis u&s;ual to take up Haddocks with ones hand beneath the Bridge, as they float aloft on the water, their eyes being &s;o blinded with the thickne&s;&s;e of the water, that they cannot &s;ee whither they &s;wimme; and how to make &s;hift for them&s;elves before the poor creature be &s;urpriz'd, otherwi&s;e the <HI>Thames</HI> water u&s;eth to be as clear and pellucid, as any &s;uch great River in the world.</P>
<P>Having gone along &s;o far with this great goodly River, even from her &s;ource until &s;he di&s;imboques, and payes Tribute to Neptune, and ca&s;t her &s;elf into his imbraces, It will be now expedient to go on further, and acquaint the Rea|der with the juri&s;diction, and Prerogatives of the <HI>Thames,</HI> with the extent thereof, Which begins at a place call'd <HI>Colnie</HI> ditch, a little above <HI>Stanes-</HI>bridge, We&s;tward as far as <HI>London-</HI>bridge, and from thence to a place call'd <HI>Yendall, alias Yenleete,</HI> and the waters of <HI>Medway,</HI> all which extent is under the juris|diction

and con&s;ervancy of the Lord Mayor, the Comminalty, and Citizens of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>True it is, that there have been &s;ome Conte&s;ts betwixt the Lord Mayor, and the Lord high Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> concerning the &s;aid Juri&s;diction and pow|er, but after a fair and judicial Tryal in open Court, the controver&s;ie was de|cided in favour of the City; and the Lord Mayor adjudged to be <HI>Con&s;ervator of the Thames.</HI></P>
<P>There were al&s;o &s;ome other controver&s;ial points about the Rivers, of <HI>Thames</HI> and <HI>Medway,</HI> but all differences were ab&s;olutely concluded <HI>Anno</HI> 1613, Sir <HI>John Swinerton</HI> being then Lord Mayor, and Mr. <HI>Sparry</HI> being then his Deputy, or re&s;pective Bayliff for the execution of &s;uch a great tru&s;t repos'd in him. Ever &s;ince, as well as in former times, the Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI> hath been &s;tyl'd the Con&s;ervator of the &s;aid River, within the forenamed limits and bounds, having plenary power to inflict puni&s;hments upon all tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors relating to the &s;aid Rivers; the Water-Bayly of <HI>London</HI> being his &s;ub&s;titute. And whereas there are a company of Fi&s;hermen call'd <HI>Tinckermen,</HI> frequenting the River of <HI>Thames</HI> Ea&s;tward, who in times pa&s;s'd have been reported, and found out to make an infinit de&s;truction of the young brood or fry of fi&s;h, by u&s;ing unlawful Nets, and other Engines feeding their Hoggs with them; by the &s;ingular care and co&s;t of the Lord Mayor, and vigilance of the City, tho&s;e prohibited Engines and Nets, are now quite &s;uppre&s;s'd, and a true, and orderly manner of fi&s;h|ing brought into u&s;e, that &s;uch a havock may not be made of the young fry.</P>
<P>Moreover, there are a great number of other kind of Fi&s;hermen, be&s;ide Tinckermen belonging to the <HI>Thames,</HI> call'd <HI>Hebbermen, Petermen,</HI> and <HI>Traw|lermen,</HI> that had lived in former times, by unlawful fi&s;hing on the &s;aid River, to the de&s;truction of the young fi&s;h, as afore&s;aid; but now they are re&s;train'd, and regulated to a more orderly way of fi&s;hing.</P>
<P>There have bin other kind of abu&s;es reformed herein, as upon complaint made to the Lord Mayor, concerning certain Timbers &s;tanding in <HI>Tilbury</HI> Hope; a matter not only dangerous to the Pa&s;&s;engers, but a cau&s;e al&s;o to de|&s;troy the young brood of fi&s;h, by the dammage tho&s;e Timbers did to the Fi&s;her|mens Nets, in regard of their continual &s;tanding in the main cour&s;e, and cur|rent of the River: that great grievance was &s;peedily redre&s;&s;ed, by the provi|dence and prudence of the Lord Mayor, and the Water-Bayly.</P>
<P>Furthermore, there hath been care taken, to clear and clean&s;e the &s;aid noble River We&s;tward of &s;eventy nine &s;tops or hatches con&s;i&s;ting of &s;undry great &s;takes and piles, purpo&s;ely erected by Fi&s;hermen for their private lucre, and &s;tanding illfavouredly for pa&s;&s;engers near unto the <HI>Fair deep;</HI> but none of them remain now, but &s;uch as &s;tand out of the pa&s;&s;able high &s;tream, and can be no prejudice to pa&s;&s;ers by; yet &s;ome are permitted to be planted at the waters bottome, and &s;o they &s;erve as a great &s;uccour to the young brood of fi&s;h, being placed &s;o remote on the River. Nor is this provident care for &s;ecurity of pa&s;&s;engers, and con&s;ervation of the young fry or fi&s;h, a new thing, for it appears that the like cour&s;e was kept in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, and after in <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, as Records and Chronicles do &s;hew. Moreover, there is a watchful eye, that no carren, or dead carka&s;&s;es be thrown into the River to pollute, or infect the &s;tream.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e intents and purpo&s;es, the Lord Mayor, and the Aldermen his Brethren with the under Officers, do u&s;e to meet eight times yearly, in the four Counties of <HI>Middle&s;ex, Surrey, Kent,</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and have a judicial &s;itting for maintenance of the Rivers Rights, and Priviledges, where they have pow|er to empanel Juries, to make Inqui&s;ition after all offences committed upon the River within their extent; And as the Verdict given up by the Jury make it appear, &s;o they proceed to the puni&s;hment of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, according to

<P>Sir <HI>John Jolles</HI> Knight and Lord Mayor of the City of <HI>London,</HI> and Con&s;erva|tor of the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and waters of <HI>Medway,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted and accompanyed by the Aldermen, and two Sheriffs then contemporary, and attended by the Recorder, and the Sub-con&s;ervator, or Water-bayly, with fifty Officers and &s;ervants, took their Barges at <HI>Belin&s;gate</HI> the third of <HI>July</HI> 1616, and within few hours arriv'd at <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> in <HI>Kent,</HI> where a Se&s;&s;ion for the con&s;ervancy of the &s;aid River was kept before the &s;aid Lord Mayor, and his forenamed A&s;&s;i&s;tants; At which time and place, a Jury of the Freeholders of the &s;aid County, being &s;worn to enquire of all offences committed in any part of the River what&s;oe|ver, within the &s;aid County, the Common Sergeant of the City (the Recorder being then ab&s;ent upon extraordinary occa&s;ions) deliver'd them a charge to this effect; That, fora&s;much as there had not been any Se&s;&s;ion of Con&s;ervancy in many years pa&s;sed, kept by any Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI> in that place, it was probable and evident they could not be well informed, neither of the Lord Mayors jurisdiction and power to reform annoyances and offences there, and to inflict due puni&s;hments upon the Offendors; nor of the nature of the &s;er|vice to be by them performed in the cour&s;e of their enquiry; therefore he thought it convenient to make it known unto them, both the one and the other. Hereupon he &s;hew'd them, The Juri&s;diction of the Court of <HI>London</HI> in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> from <HI>Stanes-</HI>bridge We&s;tward unto the points of the River next the Sea Ea&s;tward, appear'd to belong to the City in manner and form fol|lowing.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, In point of right by <HI>Prae&s;cription,</HI> as it appeareth by an ancient Book call'd <HI>Dunthorne,</HI> that, <HI>Civitatis fundationis, aedificationis, &amp; con&s;tructionis cau|&s;acrat Thame&s;is Fluvius, quorum vero Civitatis &amp; Fluminis gubernationem tam Duces, Majores, Cu&s;todes, Vicecomites, Aldr. &amp; magnates Civitatis memoratae hucu&s;que obtinuerunt &amp; habuerunt;</HI> Whence he inferr'd, that the government of the River hath belong'd to the City, time out of mind.

<P>Secondly, in point of right <HI>by allowance in Eire,</HI> the con&s;ervation of the <HI>Thames</HI> belongs to the City: for it was produc'd that 1. <HI>Rich.</HI> 2. before <HI>Hugh Bigot</HI> be|ing Ju&s;tice Itinerant, the Sheriffs and Citizens of <HI>London</HI> were call'd in que&s;tion for their Juri&s;diction exerci&s;ed on the <HI>Thames,</HI> before whom it was found by a Jury in <HI>Southwark, Qu&ograve;d nullus habeat aliquid juris in Thami&s;ia u&s;que ad novum gurgitem ni&s;i Cives Londonex&s;.</HI> In the 14. of <HI>Ed.</HI> 2. the Con&s;table of the <HI>Tower,</HI> was indited by divers Wards of <HI>London,</HI> before the Ju&s;tices in <HI>Eire</HI> at the <HI>Tower, De muneris et recep. cove. pro kidellis in Thami&s;iis, et Con&s;tabularius ad Kidellas re&s;pondet qu&ograve;d Ju&s;tic. non habent juri&s;dictionem extra</HI> London <HI>plitum. inde cogno&s;|cere cum predict. kidelli &s;unt in aliis comitatibus, et Ju&s;tic. dixerunt, Aqua Thami&s;ia

The Mayor and Aldermen did exhibit their humble Petition to the Kings Councel reciting; That, time out of minde, they have had the con&s;er|vation and correction of the River of Thames, of all trinks, nets, and other En|gines what&s;oever in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and Medway placed, and have u&s;ed to make a &s;ub-Con&s;ervator under them; and complaining, that <HI>Alexander Bonner,</HI> then &s;ub-Con&s;ervator, having di&s;charg'd his duty, in removing Kiddels, he was ill entreated by the owners, the &s;ame owners dwelling in <HI>Erith, Putri|ferry, Barking, Woolwich,</HI> and other places in the Counties of Kent, and E&s;&s;ex: and upon hearing of the matter in <HI>Camera &s;tellata,</HI> they were found guilty, and con&s;trained to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the Lord Mayor, and ordered to bring alwayes their Nets unto him, before they &s;hould u&s;e them. And that the Kiddles then taken, &s;hould be at the di&s;po&s;ition of the Lord Mayor; &s;o the Offendors made their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion accordingly.</P>
<P N="7">7. He proceeds; This right appertains to the City of <HI>London,</HI> by <HI>Letters Pa|tents,</HI> which he proved by a grant made by <HI>Edward</HI> the 4th, to the Earl of <HI>Pem|broke,</HI> for &s;etting up a Weare in the River of Thames: which grant was revok'd and annul'd, at the in&s;tance of the Lord Mayor, and the Aldermen, upon &s;hew|ing their right: therefore alledg'd, It was contrary to their ancient Cu&s;toms. At which time, the Cities Title to the con&s;ervacy of the Thames, and Medway, was at large &s;et forth, and recited to have bin &s;hewn to the Lord Chancellour, and to the &s;aid Earl and his Councel, which accordingly was allowed.</P>
<P N="8">8. He reinforceth the right of the City by <HI>Proclamations,</HI> whereof one was made by <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. in 34. of his Raign, wherein it is affirmed, that the Lord Mayor and his Predece&s;&s;ors, have had by divers grants of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> and, by Acts of Parliament, enjoyed alwayes the con&s;ervacy of the Thames, without impediments, or interruption; By which Proclamation, it was com|manded that none &s;hould re&s;i&s;t, deny, or impugne the Lord Mayor, or his De|puty, in doing or executing any thing that might conduce to the con&s;ervacy of the River, and of the fi&s;h and fry within the &s;ame.</P>
<P N="9">9. He produceth <HI>Report;</HI> for in a controver&s;ie 'twixt the Lord Admiral, and the Lord Mayor, for the mea&s;uring of Coles, and other things upon the Thames, it then fell into debate, to whom the Con&s;ervacy of the River appertain'd which cau&s;e was referred by Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Councel of State, 1597. to the Atturney General, and Solicitor, who joyntly certified among other things, <HI>that the Con&s;ervacy and care of the River did, and ought to belong to the City of London,</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. By <HI>quo Warranto,</HI> 'twas proved, that the Con&s;ervacy of the Thames be|longs to the City, for 3. <HI>Jacobi;</HI> a <HI>quo warranto,</HI> was brought again&s;t the City in the Exchequer, to know by what Title &s;he claimed the Con&s;ervacy of the Ri|ver of Thames, &amp; the waters of Medway: whereupon the City made her Title good thereunto, by ancient pre&s;cription, and otherwi&s;e; &s;o judgement was given in her favour.</P>
<P N="11">11. He goes on afterwards to confirm the right of the City, <HI>by proof of u&s;age;</HI> in regard the Lord Mayor and Aldermen have time out of minde, made Ordi|nances concerning the good Government of the River of Thames, as well for
<PB N="18" REF="17">
the &s;ea&s;ons and manner of fi&s;hing beneath <HI>London</HI> Bridge Ea&s;tward, upon pain of penalties, as it appears from time to time, from the Raign of <HI>Hen.</HI> 3. and &s;o downward: the Lord Mayor hath removed Kiddels, Weares, Trinks, and o|ther unlawful Engines, and hath reformed the di&s;orders of &s;uch as have offen|ded be&s;ides, in the River of Thames, and inflicted puni&s;hment, upon Offendors accordingly.</P>
<P>The right of the City appeares al&s;o by the Writs and Precepts under the te&s;te of the Lord Mayor, to the Sheriffs of Kent and E&s;&s;ex, for the returning of Ju|ries before him, to enquire of Offences done in the River. The &s;ame right of the City, appeares al&s;o by Commi&s;&s;ions, whereof divers have bin directed to the Lord Mayor, to put in execution the Acts of Parliament, made for the Con&s;ervancie of the <HI>Thames and Medway,</HI> and to enquire of all offences, made or done in the &s;aid waters, and to puni&s;h the Delinquents accor|dingly.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, He makes good the Right and Title of the City, by the continual claim &s;he made thereunto, as appears in tho&s;e various conte&s;ts &s;he had with the Lord Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> wherein after divers debates and bandings, &s;he kept &s;till above water, and made her Title good; which moved King <HI>James, Anno</HI> the 3d of his Raign, to put a final determination to the bu&s;ine&s;s by the Letters Patents, he pa&s;&s;ed unto the City, wherein he &s;aith, that <HI>ad omnem controver&s;i|am in hac parte temporibus tam pre&s;entibus qu&agrave;m futuris tollendam, &amp; omne dubi|um amovendum,</HI> that to cut off all controver&s;ies, as well of the pre&s;ent times, as of future, and to remove all doubts, he did confirm and ratifie the &s;aid right unto the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Thus was the Title, Prerogative, and right of the City of <HI>London</HI> &s;toutly, and &s;trongly a&s;&s;erted by eleven pregnant, and convincing proofs, to the con&s;ervati|on of her dearly beloved Minion, the River of Thames, both by pre&s;cription; by allowance in <HI>Eire;</HI> by ancient Charters; by Acts of Parliament; by Inqui&s;i|tions; by Decrees <HI>coram ip&s;o Rege;</HI> By Letters Patents; by Proclamations; by Report of the learned Councel; by a <HI>quo Warranto;</HI> And la&s;tly, by ancient u|&s;age, cu&s;tom, and continual claim.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Stow</HI> in his &s;urvey of the City of <HI>London,</HI> hath more about this bu&s;ine&s;s, then here is in&s;erted, which made the la&s;t King <HI>Charles</HI> the fir&s;t, to command Sir <HI>John Coke</HI> his Secretary, to write to Sir <HI>Henry Martin,</HI> Judge of the Ad|miralty, to this effect,</P>
<P><HI>That His Maje&s;ty under&s;tanding, that a &s;econd Edition of</HI> Stowes <HI>Sur|vey of the City of</HI> London, <HI>was put new to &s;ale, wherein there are &s;ome pa&s;&s;a|ges prejudicial to His Maje&s;ties Right in his Admiralty, and derogatory to the ju&s;t power belonging thereunto, his Maje&s;ty did therefore require him, his Judge in that high Court, to examine the &s;aid Book, and to cau&s;e the &s;aid pa&s;&s;ages in&s;erted in prejudice of the Admirals Jurisdiction, and in &s;upport of any other pretence again&s;t the &s;ame, to be left out, or el&s;e to prohibite the publi&s;hing, and &s;ale of the &s;aid Book, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Sir <HI>Henry Martin</HI> having received this Letter, after the Book was printed, and publiquely &s;old, all that he could do, was to have Sir <HI>John Cokes</HI> Letter in|&s;erted in the la&s;t Folio of <HI>Stow,</HI> to &s;tand there for a Cautionary Re&s;erve, and Re|cord for the future.</P>
<P>Now, there be many things that concern the incumbency of the Con&s;erva|tor of &s;o Noble a River, it being an Office of no &s;mall extent.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t duty is to pre&s;erve the currency of the &s;tream, and the banks on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>Secondly, He mu&s;t pre&s;erve the Fi&s;h and Fry within the &s;ame; He mu&s;t prevent all Encroachments upon the River, and the banks thereof; as al&s;o he
<PB N="19" REF="17">
mu&s;t enquire of all Flud-gates, Mill-dams, and &s;uch like annoyances; and whether any do hurl in any &s;oyl, du&s;t, or rubbi&s;h, or other filth what&s;oever to choak her. But for the &s;trength, and &s;afety of the River, again&s;t the inva&s;ion of an enemy, by Block-hou&s;es, Forts, Ba&s;tions or Ca&s;tles, and the &s;ecuring of the Merchant, and Navigation to and fro, that charge belongs to the Soveraign Prince, and not to the City.</P>
<P>But indeed, touching the former charge, circum&s;pection and care of the River of Thames, it is mo&s;t proper for the City of <HI>London,</HI> who lies perpetually by her Beds &s;ide, and therefore in a fit po&s;ture to be watchful of her: for which vigilance the Thames rewards her abundantly, by bringing her in the Spices of the South, the Jewels of the Ea&s;t, and Trea&s;ure of the We&s;t, In&s;omuch, that it may be well &s;aid, this Office of Con&s;ervator&s;hip, or &s;uperintendency of &s;o Noble and u&s;eful a River, is as a fair flower, or rich Jewel, in the Cap of mainte|nance. This famous River, taking all her advantages together, &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all other what&s;oever, that pay tribute to the Ocean, if you regard the &s;treightne&s;s of her cour&s;e, the &s;tilne&s;s of her &s;tream, for her proportionable latitude; as al&s;o her length, for &s;he comes &s;porting along from her fir&s;t &s;ource, above nine&s;core miles before &s;he embo&s;omes her &s;elf in the Arms of <HI>Neptune.</HI> Add hereunto, the great &s;tore, and variety of Fi&s;h &s;he abounds withall; the mo&s;t delectable, and fertile &s;oiles, on both &s;ides; And la&s;tly the conveniency of her &s;citua|tion being towards the Center of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And then in her entrance to the Sea, &s;he opens upon <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Flan|ders,</HI> having them both in her eye; Be&s;ides, &s;he hath another advantagious property, that to the knowing Native, the entrance into the River is &s;afe and ea&s;ie, but difficult and hazardous to &s;trangers, either to come in, or go out; In|&s;omuch, that the Thames may be &s;aid to be <HI>Londons</HI> be&s;t friend, which puts me in minde of a pa&s;&s;age of drollery, that happened in the time of King <HI>James,</HI> who being di&s;plea&s;ed with the City, becau&s;e &s;he would not lend him &s;uch a &s;um of money, and the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen attending him one day, being &s;omewhat tran&s;ported, he &s;aid, that he would remove his own Court, with all the Records of the Tower, and the Courts of We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall, to another place, with further expre&s;&s;ions of his indignation. The Lord Mayor calmly heard all and at la&s;t an&s;wered, Your Maje&s;ty hath power to do what you plea&s;e, and your City of <HI>London</HI> will obey accordingly; <HI>but &s;he humbly de&s;ires, that when your Maje&s;ty &s;hall remove your Courts, you would plea&s;e to leave the Thames behind you.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Of the great and admirable BRIDGE In the City of <HI>LONDON</HI> over the Thames.</HEAD>
<P>HAving bin thus long upon water, and accompanied the <HI>Thames</HI> to <HI>Thetis</HI> lap, 'tis time now to land, and take a view of her greate&s;t Bridge, which, if the &s;tupendious Site, and &s;tructure thereof be well con&s;idered, may be &s;aid to be one of the Wonders of the World: though, as &s;ome think, it hath too many Arches; &s;o that it may be &s;aid, <HI>If Lon|don Bridge had fewer eyes, it would &s;ee far better.</HI></P>
<P>Now as we fetch'd the Thames from her Spring, &s;o we will fetch her Bridge from its fir&s;t foundation. At fir&s;t there was but a Ferry kept in the place where now the Bridge is built, at length the Ferriman and his Wife decea&s;ing, left the &s;aid Ferry to their only Daughter a Mayden, who with other goods, left her by her Parents, together with the profits ari&s;ing from the &s;aid Ferry, did build a holy Hou&s;e for Nuns; in place whereof, the Ea&s;t part of St. <HI>Mary O|veries</HI> &s;tands now above the Quire, where &s;he was buried: and unto that Hou&s;e of Nuns, &s;he bequeathed the over-&s;ight and benefit of the Ferry; But after|wards, that Hou&s;e of Nuns being converted into a Hou&s;e of Prie&s;ts, the Prie&s;ts did build a Bridge of Timber, and from time to time, kept the &s;ame in good reparation, till at length, con&s;idering the great charges which were be&s;towed in the frequent repair of the woodden Bridge, there was at la&s;t, by the Contri|butions of the Citizens, and others, a Bridge built of Stone.</P>
<P>The Timber Bridge had &s;tood &s;ome Ages before; for the Story &s;aith, that when <HI>Sweyn,</HI> King of <HI>Denmark,</HI> had be&s;ieged the City of <HI>London,</HI> both by Wa|ter and Land in the year 994. the Citizens manfully defended them&s;elves under their King <HI>Ethelred;</HI> &s;o that a great number of the Enemies was &s;lain in Battel, and part of them were drown'd in the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> becau&s;e they could not recover the Bridge: Add hereunto, that in the year 1016. <HI>Canutus</HI> the <HI>Dane,</HI> with a great Navy came up to <HI>London,</HI> and on the South of the Thames caus'd a Trench to be ca&s;t, through the which his Ships were tow'd towards the We&s;t &s;ide of the Bridge, and then with a deep Trench, and &s;treight &s;iege, he encompa&s;&s;ed the City about.</P>
<P>Moreover, 1052. the Earl <HI>Godwin,</HI> with the like Navy, taking his cour&s;e up the River, and finding no re&s;i&s;tance on the Bridge, he &s;ail'd up the South &s;ide. Further, 1067. <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror in his Charter to the Church of St. <HI>Peter</HI> in We&s;tmin&s;ter, confirmed to the Monks &s;erving God there, a Gate in <HI>London</HI> call'd <HI>Buttolphs</HI> Gate then, with a Wharf which was at the head of <HI>London</HI> Bridge.</P>
<P>We read likewi&s;e, that <HI>Anno</HI> 1114. in the raign of <HI>Henry</HI> 1. the River of Thames was &s;o dryed up, and the water grew &s;o &s;hallow, that between the Tower of <HI>London</HI> and the Bridge, not only with Hor&s;e, but people might have pa&s;&s;ed over a foot.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="18">
In the year 1122, <HI>Thomas Arden</HI> gave to the Monks at <HI>Bermond&s;ey</HI> the Church of St. <HI>George</HI> in <HI>Southwark,</HI> and five &s;hillings yearly rent out of the Land pertaining to <HI>London-</HI>Bridge. There is al&s;o a remarkable Charter of <HI>Hen.</HI> 1. upon Record, to this tenor. Henry <HI>King of</HI> England, <HI>to</HI> Ralph Chiche|&s;ter, <HI>and all the Mini&s;ters of</HI> Su&s;&s;ex, <HI>&s;endeth greeting; Know ye, I command by my Kingly authority, that the Manor call'd</HI> Alce&s;ton, <HI>which my Father gave with other Lands to the</HI> Abbey <HI>of</HI> Battle, <HI>be free, and quiet from Shiers and Hundreds, and all other Cu&s;tomes of earthly &s;ervitude, as my Father held the &s;ame mo&s;t freely and qui|etly, and namely from the work of</HI> London-<HI>Bridge, the work of the Ca&s;tle at</HI> Peven|&s;ey: <HI>And this I command upon my forfaiture. Witne&s;&s;e</HI> William de Pontdelarche <HI>at</HI> Berry.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t year of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> a fire began in the hou&s;e of one <HI>Ailwards</HI> neer unto <HI>London-</HI>&s;tone, which con&s;um'd Ea&s;t unto <HI>Ludgate,</HI> and We&s;t to St. <HI>Erken&s;|wald's</HI> &s;heine in St. <HI>Pauls</HI> Church. The Bridge of Timber upon the River of <HI>Thames</HI> was al&s;o burnt, but afterwards repair'd. Be&s;ides in the Reign of the &s;aid King <HI>Stephen,</HI> and of <HI>Hen.</HI> 2. men &s;tood in great numbers upon the Bridge to &s;ee pa&s;times that were upon the River. In the year 1163, that Bridge was not only repair'd, but built all of new Timber as before, by <HI>Peter Colechurch</HI> Prie&s;t, and Chaplain.</P>
<P>This &s;erves to &s;hew, that there was a Timber Bridge a long tract of time over the <HI>Thames,</HI> which was maintain'd partly by the proper Lands thereof, partly by the Legacies and liberality of divers per&s;ons, and partly by tax|ations in divers Sheirs, at lea&s;t 215 years before the Bridge of &s;tone was erected.</P>
<P>Now, about the year 1176 the &s;tone-Bridge had its fir&s;t foundation by the fore&s;aid <HI>Peter</HI> of <HI>Cole-Church,</HI> near unto the place of the Timber Bridge, but &s;omewhat more We&s;t, for the Chronicle &s;aith, that <HI>Buttolphes</HI> Wharf was at the end of <HI>London-</HI>Bridge; The King not only countenanced, but a&s;&s;i&s;ted the great work, a Cardinal being then here Legate, and <HI>Richard</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbu|ty,</HI> gave 1000 Marks towards the Foundation. The cour&s;e of the River for a time was turn'd another way about, by a trench ca&s;t up for that purpo&s;e, begin|ning Ea&s;t about <HI>Radriff,</HI> and ending in the We&s;t about <HI>Patricksey,</HI> now call'd <HI>Batter&s;ay.</HI> This work to wit, the Arches, Chappel, and the Stone Bridge over the <HI>Thames</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> having been 33 years in building, was in the year 1209 fini|&s;hed, by the worthy Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> viz. <HI>Serle Mercer, William Almane,</HI> and <HI>Benedict, Botewrite,</HI> being principal Ma&s;ters of that Fabrique: for <HI>Peter Colechurch</HI> was dead four years before, and was as the principal Benefactor bu|ried in the Chappel on the Bridge.</P>
<P>Certain void places were given by King <HI>John</HI> to build upon about <HI>London,</HI> the profits whereof were a&s;&s;ign'd to maintain the Bridge.</P>
<P>A Ma&s;on, being Ma&s;ter Workman of the Bridge, builded from the foundati|on the large Chappel on that Bridge upon his own charges, which Chappel was then endow'd with two Prie&s;ts and four Clerks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be&s;ides Chanteries; After the fini&s;hing of this Chappel, which was the fir&s;t building upon tho&s;e Arches, &s;undry Man&s;ion Hou&s;es in tract of time were erected; whereunto many charitable men gave Lands, Tenements, and &s;ums of money towards the main|tenance thereof; All which was &s;ometimes regi&s;tred, and fairly written in a Table for po&s;terity, which was put up in the &s;aid Chappel, till at la&s;t the &s;aid Chappel was turn'd to a dwelling Hou&s;e, and then remov'd to the Bridge-hou&s;e: Now, in <HI>Hen.</HI> 7. time it &s;tands upon Record, that all the payments and allowances belonging to <HI>London-</HI>Bridge, amounted to above 815 <HI>l.</HI> by which account made then, may be partly gue&s;&s;ed the great Revenues, and incomes of the &s;aid Bridge, and to what improvement, and encrea&s;e it may be come unto by this time.</P>

But this noble Bridge, as other earthly things, hath &s;uffer'd many di&s;a&s;ters &s;ince: for four years after the fini&s;hing thereof, in the year 1212, on the 10th. of <HI>July</HI> at night, the Burrough of <HI>Southwark</HI> on the South &s;ide of <HI>Thames,</HI> as al&s;o the Church of our Lady of the Canons there, being on fire, and an exceeding great multitude of people pa&s;&s;ing the Bridge, either to extingui&s;h and quench it, or to behold and gaze upon it, &s;uddenly the North part by blowing of the South wind, was al&s;o &s;et on fire, and the people which were then pa&s;&s;ing the Bridge perceiving the &s;ame, would have return'd, but were &s;topp'd by the fury of the fire: and it came to pa&s;&s;e as they &s;tayed all in a con&s;ternation, and protract|ed the time; the other South end of the Bridge, was al&s;o &s;et on fire; &s;o that the people thronging them&s;elves betwixt two raging fires, did nothing el&s;e but expect pre&s;ent death; Whereupon, there came to &s;ave them many &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els, into which the multitude &s;o inadvi&s;edly ru&s;h'd in, that the &s;hips being thereby &s;unk, they all peri&s;hed; And it was found that above three thou&s;and &s;ouls peri&s;hed by this di&s;a&s;trous accident at that time, who&s;e bodies were found half burnt, be&s;ides tho&s;e who were turn'd to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>Furthermore, in the year 1282, through a great fro&s;t and deep &s;now, five Arches of <HI>London</HI> Bridge were born down, and de&s;troyed: A little after, <HI>Anna</HI> 1289, the Bridge was o &s;ore decayed for want of reparations, that people were afraid to pa&s;s thereon, and a &s;ub&s;idy was granted towards the amendment there|of; Afterwards, Sir <HI>John Britain,</HI> being then <HI>Cu&s;tos</HI> of <HI>London Anno</HI> 1381, a great Collection was made by all the Clergy for the repair of <HI>London-</HI>Bridge.</P>
<P>In the year 1381, on St. <HI>Georges</HI> day was a great &s;olemnity of Ju&s;ts and Tour|nements upon <HI>London-</HI>Bridge, between <HI>David</HI> Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Wells</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> whereby one may infer, that the hou&s;es were not there &s;o thick, at that time.</P>
<P>The Tower on <HI>London-</HI>bridge, at the North end of the Draw-bridge (which was then in a po&s;ture to be drawn up) was built <HI>Anno</HI> 1426, in the Majoralty of <HI>John Rainwell.

<P>But in the year &s;ixteen hundred thirty three, there happen'd a mo&s;t raging di&s;mal fire upon the North &s;ide of <HI>London-</HI>bridge, which by computation con|&s;um'd above the third part of the Buildings thereof; But by the commendable care of the City, there are other goodly &s;tructures rais'd up in &s;ome of their rooms, of a &s;tronger and more &s;tately way of building, and pity it is that the work were not compleated, there being no object (after the Church of St. <HI>Pauls)</HI> that can conduce more to the glory and Ornament of this renowned City.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, this Bridge that may be call'd, <HI>the Bridge of the world,</HI> there are other inferior Bridges, which have &s;till the names of Bridges that belong to the City of <HI>London,</HI> the fir&s;t is <HI>Fleet-bridge</HI> in the We&s;t, fenc'd with iron Pikes, on which towards the South there be certain Lanthorns of Stones, for lights to be placed in Winter Evenings, for com|modity of pa&s;&s;engers; Under this Bridge runs a water &s;ometimes call'd, the River <HI>Wells,</HI> but &s;ince <HI>Turn-hill brook,</HI> and now <HI>Fleet Dike,</HI> becau&s;e it runs by the <HI>Fleet</HI> under ground to the River of <HI>Thames;</HI> this Bridge hath been far greater in times pa&s;s'd, but le&s;&s;ened as the water cour&s;e hath been narrowed.</P>

<P>ANd now that we are come &s;o near the famous and great <HI>Tower</HI> Pala|tine, or Cittadel of <HI>London;</HI> we will try whether we can get in thi|ther, without paying fees, and take a view thereof as briefly as we can, it being an ill-favoured, and tedious thing to &s;tay there long.</P>
<P>I know it is the current vulgar opinion, that <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> the fir&s;t <HI>Conque|rour,</HI> or rather indeed <HI>Di&s;coverer</HI> of <HI>Britain,</HI> was the Original Founder thereof, but there is very litle probability of truth in that for two Rea&s;ons; The fir&s;t is, the little &s;tay he made here, during which he had other things to think on: The &s;econd is, that he him&s;elf who is &s;o exact in his relations, &s;pecially if they conduce to his honour; nor any other <HI>Roman</HI> Author, makes any mention of of &s;uch a work, or Fabrique; Therefore, that opinion which approacheth truth the neere&s;t, is, that <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Normandy</HI> the <HI>Conqueror,</HI> was the fir&s;t tracer and erector of the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> as <HI>Edmond de Hadenham,</HI> an old Engli&s;h Anti|quary affirms; The fir&s;t part that was built, was the great &s;quare and White Tower, (though black to &s;ome) which was about the year 1078, where|of <HI>Gundulph</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> was principal Supervi&s;er and Surveyer, who was log'd then in the hou&s;e of <HI>Edmere</HI> a Burge&s;&s;e of <HI>London,</HI> as it &s;tands upon La|tine Record in the forenamed Author.</P>
<P>Now it is to be con&s;idered, that at fir&s;t the wall of the City was in many pla|ces furni&s;h'd with &s;undry Ba&s;tions and Turrets in due di&s;tance one from the other, and divers &s;tood on the waters &s;ide, where &s;ome of the &s;aid Wall extended at fir&s;t, but the <HI>Thames</HI> with her ebbings and flowings, did as it were corrode, and &s;ubvert tho&s;e Buildings on the South &s;ide; Wherefore the <HI>Conqueror</HI> (for then the Art of fortification was come to a greater perfection) for defence of the City and River, pitch'd upon that place as mo&s;t convenient, to erect a Bulwark in the Ea&s;t part of the Wall. The White &s;quare Tower (as was formerly &s;aid) was fir&s;t erected, and fini&s;h'd in the <HI>Conquerors</HI> time, but &s;tood naked and &s;ingle without other Buildings a good while: and the &s;tory &s;aith, that in <HI>William Rufus</HI> time, it was by the injury of the Heavens, and violence of tempe&s;t &s;ore &s;haken, and &s;ome part tumbled down, which was repair'd by the &s;aid <HI>Rufus</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> the fir&s;t, who al&s;o cau&s;ed a Ca&s;tle to be built under the &s;aid White Tower, on the South &s;ide towards the <HI>Thames,</HI> and he &s;urrounded that al&s;o with a &s;trong Wall; Now, <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Huntindon</HI> relates, that <HI>VVill.

In former times, there were per&s;ons of high quality that kept the&s;e Bea&s;ts (whereof the Earl of <HI>Oxford</HI> was one) and they had a Pen&s;ion from the Crown belonging to the Office. Mr. <HI>Robert Gill</HI> a very worthy Gentleman hath the place now, and hath had it many years, Nor was the <HI>Tower</HI> ever better furni&s;h'd with Lions than it is now, there being &s;ix in all, young and old. <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth fortified the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and enclo&s;ed with Brick<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters"> certain enclo&s;ure of ground taken from <HI>Tower-hill</HI> We&s;tward, now call'd the <HI>Bullwark.</HI> His Officers al&s;o &s;et up upon the &s;aid Hill a Gallowes, and a Scaffold, for the execution of offendors, whereupon the Lord Mayor com|plaining to the King, all the an&s;wer he had, was, that it was not done to the derogation of the City.</P>
<P>In the year 1216, the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London</HI> was delivered to <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> by the Barons of <HI>England,</HI> who banded again&s;t the King; <HI>Anno</HI> 1222. the Citi|zens of <HI>London,</HI> having made an uprore again&s;t the Abbot of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter, Hubere de Burgh</HI> chief Ju&s;tice of <HI>England</HI> came to the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and &s;ummoned before him the Mayor and Aldermen: of whom he enquired, and demanded the principal Authors of that In&s;urrection.

<P>It is upon Record, that <HI>Edw.</HI> 2. allowed a Knight 2 d. <HI>per diem,</HI> and a Squire a peny, for their Diet, as long as they were pri&s;oners in the Tower upon his Command: <HI>Roger Mortimer</HI> being pri&s;oner in the Tower, gave his Watch-men a &s;leeping potion, and &s;o e&s;caped; but afterwards, he was arraigned and condemned by his Peers, without per&s;onal appearance, and &s;o executed at the Elmes, where he hung two dayes.</P>
<P>The Londoners in the year 1326. &s;eized upon the Tower, wre&s;ting the keys out of the Con&s;tables hands, they freed all the Pri&s;oners, and kept it in their hands for the u&s;e of Queen <HI>I&s;abel,</HI> and her Son <HI>Edward,</HI> both Tower and City.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t gold that was coin'd in the Tower, was in the raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and the peeces were call'd Florences, of the value of 6 <HI>s. 8 d; Perceval de po&s;t</HI> being Ma&s;ter of the Mint at that time.

And they had their antiquity no further, then from the raign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd. Neverthele&s;s, the Saxon coines before the Con|que&s;t, were pence of fine &s;ilver, &s;omewhat weightier, and better then the latter &s;tarlings, and the probable&s;t Rea&s;on that is given, why it was &s;tarling money, was, becau&s;e in the ring or border of the peny, there was a Starre &s;tamp|ed.</P>
<P>But to return to the Tower of <HI>London:</HI> In the year 1360. <HI>John</HI> the French King being Pri&s;oner in the Tower, King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, being newly retur|ned victoriou&s;ly from <HI>France,</HI> the fir&s;t thing he did, was to vi&s;it his Pri&s;oner who&s;e ran&s;ome was a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed afterwards at three millions of Florences or No|bles; whereupon he was brought honourably to the Sea &s;ide: <HI>Anno</HI> 1387.

<P>In the year 1458. there were Ju&s;ts and Tournements in the Tower, wherein the chief Actor was the Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et; Anno 1465, Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, was brought Pri&s;oner to the Tower, where he remained many years, of whom was given this Character, that <HI>he was a good King, but born in an ill time:</HI> The Mayor of <HI>London</HI> Sir <HI>Richard Lee,</HI> and the Aldermen, freed the &s;aid King <HI>Henry</HI> once from his impri&s;onment; but being &s;ent thither again, he was pittifully mur|thered. <HI>Anno</HI> 1478.

<P><HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Oxford, Anno</HI> 1485. was made Con&s;table of the Tower, and he had al&s;o the keeping of the Lions, and Leopards, as the &s;tory makes men|tion.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> Wife to <HI>Henry</HI> the 7th, died in the Tower, <HI>Anno</HI> 1502. in Child-birth, and the year before there was running at tilt, and tourney there; The Chappel in the high white Tower was burnt <HI>Anno</HI> 1512. Queen <HI>Anne Bullein,</HI> was beheaded in the Tower 1541. and a little after, the Lady <HI>Kathe|rine Howard,</HI> both Wifes to <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth: <HI>Anno</HI> 1546. a &s;trange accident happened in the Tower: for one <HI>Foxley,</HI> who was Pot-maker for the Mint, be|ing fallen a&s;leep, he could not be awakened by pinching, cramping, or burning for fourteen dayes, at which time he awak'd as fre&s;h as at the fir&s;t day he began to &s;leep.</P>

<P>The young Lady <HI>Jane,</HI> was beheaded there not long after, and upon the Scaf|fold &s;he made a mo&s;t ingenious Speech, and full of pity, <HI>That &s;he came thither, to &s;erve for an example to po&s;terity, that innocence cannot be any protection again&s;t greatne&s;s; And that &s;he was come thither, not for a&s;piring to a Crown, but for not refu&s;ing one, when it was offered Her.</HI></P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> was brought up many years in that School of affliction, but afterwards &s;he may be &s;aid to have gone from the Scaffold to the Throne; For the truth is, that the Scaffold had made an end of her, had not King <HI>Philip</HI> her Brother in Law, &s;trongly interceded for her. In her dayes, <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> lo&s;t his head in the Tower, which he might have kept on many years longer, had he not bin betrayed by the Lady <HI>Wal&s;ingham;</HI> to whom after the &s;entence of condemnation, he &s;ent a Ring, which the Queen had given him as a token that &s;he would &s;tick to him in any danger: the Lady delivered not this Ring, and being a little after upon her Death-bed &s;he de&s;ired to &s;peak with the Queen, and having disburthened a great weight which lay upon her Con&s;ci|ence for that act, the Queen flung away in a fury, and never enjoyed her &s;elf perfectly after that time, but &s;he would break out often into pa&s;&s;ion, and wring her hands, crying, O <HI>E&s;&s;ex, E&s;&s;ex.</HI> And this Earl was the la&s;t, who was executed within the walls of the Tower.</P>

<HEAD>Of the publick places of Sciences and Litera|ture which <HI>London</HI> hath.</HEAD>
<P>IT is ob&s;erved, that the Engli&s;h Nation hath bin alwaies extraordinarily addicted to Literature, and to the love of Knowledge: which among other in&s;tances appears; in that, of old times, there were three principal Churches in <HI>London</HI> which had famous Schools, wherein there were profe&s;|&s;ors &amp; Doctors, which were famous for their knowledge in Philo&s;ophy and the Mathematicks; The three Churches which had the&s;e Schools by Priviledges, were the Cathedral Church of Saint <HI>Paul,</HI> for by General Councel held in the year 1176 at Rome in the Patriarchy of Saint <HI>Lateran,</HI> it was decreed, that eve|ry Cathedral Church &s;ho uld have a School-ma&s;ter to teach poor Schollers, and others. The &s;econd, was St. <HI>Peters</HI> in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> whereof <HI>Ingulphus</HI> Abbot of <HI>Crowland</HI> in the Reign of <HI>William</HI> the Conqueror writes thus; <HI>I</HI> Ingulphus <HI>an humble &s;ervant of God, born of Engli&s;h Parents in the mo&s;t beautiful City of</HI> Lon|don, <HI>for to attain to Learning, was fir&s;t put to</HI> We&s;tmin&s;ter, <HI>and after to &s;tudy at</HI> Oxford, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The third School, &s;eemes to have bin in the Mona&s;tery of St. Savi|our in <HI>Bermond&s;ey</HI> at <HI>Southwark.</HI></P>
<P>There were other Schools built afterwards, as that of St <HI>John</HI> by <HI>Smithfield,</HI> and that of Saint <HI>Bart holmew,</HI> that of Saint <HI>Mary Overies,</HI> and that of the holy <HI>Trinity</HI> by <HI>Ealdgate,</HI> with divers others; But touching Philo&s;ophy and other Sciences, in regard that the Colledges in <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>Cambridge</HI> did &s;o much en|crea&s;e; the former meetings in <HI>London,</HI> and di putes in Philo&s;ophy, that were u&s;ed to be, did di&s;continue; Only of late years, that noble <HI>Maecenas</HI> and Patri|or, Sir <HI>Thomas Gre&s;ham,</HI> did erect to his eternal honour a <HI>Colledge</HI> for all the Sciences, in <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate-</HI>&s;treet, as an attendant to his <HI>Royall Exchange.</HI></P>
<P>The Chronicles teach us, that <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth having &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the <HI>Priories Aliens,</HI> whereof there were &s;ome about <HI>London,</HI> namely, our Lady of <HI>Rouncival</HI> by <HI>Charing cro&s;&s;e,</HI> one other Ho&s;pital in <HI>Oldborn,</HI> now <HI>Holborn,</HI> another without <HI>Gripplegate,</HI> and the fourth without <HI>Alder&s;gate,</HI> be&s;ides others that are worne long &s;ince out of memory, only that of <HI>Rouncival</HI> continued till the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, being converted to a brotherhood; But <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth ap|pointed by Patent, that there &s;hould be in <HI>London</HI> more Grammar Schooles erected, to wit, one in St <HI>Andrews</HI> in <HI>Holborn,</HI> another in <HI>Alhallows</HI> the great, another in St <HI>Peters</HI> on <HI>Cornhil,</HI> and another in the Ho&s;pital of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Acon</HI> in We&s;t cheap.

<P>Moreover, in the year 1553, after the erection of <HI>Christs Ho&s;pital,</HI> which ri&s;&s;e out of the ruins of the <HI>Grey Fryers</HI> that &s;tood there, a great number of poor chil|dren were taken in, and a fair School appointed at the charge of the City, though <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth bear the name of Patron.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1561 the <HI>Marchant Taylors</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> founded one notable School. in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Lawrence Poultney.</HI> The hou&s;e was &s;ometimes the Duke of <HI>Buckinghams</HI> called, <HI>the Mannor of the Ro&s;e,</HI> which Mr. <HI>Richard Hills</HI> Ma&s;ter of the company, did purcha&s;e for 500 l. and be&s;towed it for a free School.</P>
<P>There was an old Cu&s;tome in <HI>London,</HI> that the School, Ma&s;ters &s;hould meet on fe&s;tival daies, and their Schollers &s;hould di&s;pute in Logick, as well as Gram|mer Que&s;tions, and Principles, and the mo&s;t common randezvouz, was Saint <HI>Bart holmews</HI> in <HI>Smithfield,</HI> being a priory, where upon a bank boorded under

<P>A great emulation there was 'twixt <HI>Pauls</HI> Schollers, and tho&s;e of St. <HI>Antho|nies;</HI> the Schollers of <HI>Pauls</HI> would taunt, and term them, St. <HI>Anthonies Piggs;</HI> and they would call St. <HI>Pauls</HI> Schollers, <HI>Pigeons of Pauls,</HI> and many feuds hap|pen'd among&s;t them in the open &s;treets: but St. <HI>Anthonies</HI> School decaying, the quarrel al&s;o ceas'd.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1582, a publick Lecture of <HI>Chirurgery</HI> was founded, to be read in the Colledge of Phy&s;itians in <HI>Knight-rider-&s;treet</HI> twice every week; The Founder thereof was, the honourable Baron the Lord <HI>Lumley,</HI> and <HI>Richard Chadwel</HI> Do|ctor of Phy&s;ick; and Doctor <HI>Fo&s;ter</HI> was the fir&s;t Reader thereof.</P>

<P>The&s;e Lectures are to be read every day in the week in Term time (Sundays excepted) in the Latine Tongue in the morning, and the &s;ame in Engli&s;h in the &s;ame dayes afternoon, only the Mu&s;ick Lecture, whereof Doctor <HI>Bull</HI> was the fir&s;t Lecturers was to be read only in Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>Moreover, there is in and about the City of London, a whole Univer&s;ity, as it were of Students, Practi&s;ers, or Pleaders, and Judges of the Lawes of England, not living of common Salaries, as is u&s;ed in other Academies; but of their private maintenance, as being &s;upported, by their own means or practi&s;e, or ex|hibition from their friends; In &s;o much that mo&s;t of them are Sons &amp; youn|ger Brothers to wealthy Parents, where, be&s;ides the knowledge of the Laws, they learn all other civilities and exerci&s;es be&s;ides.</P>

Touching the two Temples, they are di&s;cour&s;ed of here in ano|ther place; But, concerning <HI>Grayes Inne</HI> and <HI>Lincolns Inne,</HI> they took their denominations from two noble Lords, who had formerly Palaces in tho&s;e places where tho&s;e two Innes now &s;tand; The one is &s;ingular, for a curious Chappel it hath; the other for choi&s;e delicate Walks, high and low, with a large delightful pro&s;pect that carrieth the optiques very far, where the choi&s;e&s;t beau|ties both of City and Suburbs u&s;e to re&s;ort in the Summer, to &s;olace them&s;elves, and breath fre&s;h aire.</P>
<P>Thus have we rambled through the City of London, and waded hitherto through univer&s;als (wherein there is not alwaies plain-dealing) we will now hunt dry foot after particulars, and find out the Primitive mode, &amp; method of Government which <HI>London</HI> had, with the Titles of her chief <HI>Magi&s;trates;</HI> We will then Mu&s;ter her twelve prime Companies, with all the re&s;t of her Corpo|rations; Then, a Perambulation &s;hall be made through all her Precincts, Al|dermanries and Wards, as far as the point of the Lord Mayors Sword doth reach; Then &s;hall there be a Parallel 'twixt <HI>London,</HI> and other the greate&s;t Ci|ties in the world; wherein it will appear to the impartial di&s;cerning Reader, that, if con&s;ideration be had to the Prerogatives and power of her chiefe&s;t Ma|gi&s;trates, to their plenty, magnificence and ho&s;pitality, to the &s;ecurity of Pa&s;&s;en|gers up and down her &s;treets at midnight, as well as at noon daies, The City of <HI>London</HI> admits no Parallel.</P>

<P>IT is no incongruous allu&s;ion, that &s;ome Polititians make, when they com|pare a <HI>City</HI> to a great <HI>Ship,</HI> whereof Government is the <HI>Healm and Rudder,</HI> which regulate, and guide her cour&s;e; <HI>Good Lawes and Constitutions,</HI> are the Cables and Ligaments; The <HI>Main-Ma&s;t</HI> is Religion, and the Stan|dard, of the Cro&s;&s;e; the <HI>Forema&s;t</HI> is Honour and Renown; the <HI>Mi&s;en Ma&s;t</HI> is Trade and Wealth; <HI>Judgement</HI> and Prudence is the <HI>Balla&s;t;</HI> Authority and &s;trength the <HI>Artillery.</HI> This Compari&s;on may quadrat with <HI>London,</HI> as much as with any other City, on the &s;urface of the Earth.

<P>Touching the primitive Government of <HI>London</HI> in the time of the <HI>Britains,</HI> Antiquity &s;carce affords us any light, whereby to di&s;cern what it was, <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> gives us mo&s;t, when he writes, that <HI>Mandrubacius</HI> was King of the <HI>Londoners,</HI> or the <HI>Trinobants,</HI> which la&s;t word extends al&s;o to &s;ome of the <HI>Counties</HI> adja|cent; But it may be wondred, that <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;hould know &s;o much, in regard that He never took firm footing in Great <HI>Britain,</HI> but, by way of explo|ration, did only <HI>di&s;cover</HI> Her; <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> and <HI>Tiberius</HI> may be &s;aid to <HI>conceal</HI> Her. <HI>Caligula</HI> intending an Inva&s;ion, was diverted by his Warres with the <HI>Germans. Claudius Cae&s;ar</HI> (from whom <HI>Gloce&s;ter</HI> takes her name, being no other then <HI>Ca&s;trumClaudii,</HI> the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Claudius)</HI> was the fir&s;t that fixt here, and he &s;ent over <HI>Publins Agriola</HI> for his Lieutenant, who took great pains to civilize the Nation: and as he was about the work, he &s;ent notice to Rome, that he pre&s;er|red the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> wits before the <HI>Gallic.</HI> Then was <HI>London</HI> made a <HI>Praefectura,</HI> and the Magi&s;trate in chief, was called <HI>Praefect</HI> (as he of <HI>Rome</HI> is called to this day) this Title continued all the time that the <HI>Romans</HI> had dominion here, which was above 300 years. Afterwards, the <HI>Romans</HI> having &s;o many great Irons in the fire by Warres they had again&s;t divers Nations, who had revolted from them, they drain'd this Iland not only of great numbers of the <HI>Briti&s;h Youth,</HI> to &s;erve them in their Wartes abroad, but drew away at la&s;t their own <HI>Legions;</HI> whereupon, the Iland being thus grown weak, much depopulated, and to a long de&s;uetude of Arms, the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who are now the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> (yet keep &s;till their fir&s;t denomination of <HI>Saxons,</HI> both in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Tongues to this day) came over with a con&s;iderable &s;trength, and having in a <HI>Parly</HI> on <HI>Salsbury</HI> Plains, mu&s;tered mo&s;t of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Nobility by a &s;tratagem, and taken <HI>Vortiger</HI> the King Pri&s;oner, He for his ran&s;om was forc'd to give, not only <HI>London,</HI> but mo&s;t part of the Iland to the <HI>Saxons.</HI> And the chief Magi&s;trate of <HI>London,</HI> they call'd <HI>Portreve,</HI> which is a Gardian or Governour of a Port, and that name is yet u&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> in &s;ome places. The <HI>Saxons</HI> then changed their names into <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> yet they continued <HI>Pagans</HI> a long time after but at la&s;t, the <HI>Britains</HI> converted them to Chri&s;tianity, and then the City of <HI>London</HI> flouri&s;hed exceedingly for many Ages, till there came over a &s;warm of <HI>Danes,</HI> who proved more fatal to <HI>London,</HI> then any other Nation; for by fire and &s;word, they had almo&s;t utterly de&s;troyed Her, had not the <HI>Londoners</HI> at la&s;t rowz'd up their &s;pi|rits, who making vertue of nece&s;&s;ity, did fall upon King <HI>Swein</HI> the in&s;ulting E|nemy, with &s;uch a re&s;olution, that by a mighty &s;laughter, and extraordinary

prowe&s;&s;e, they utterly repel'd him; The City having recovered her former lu&s;tre (though 'twas a good while fir&s;t) &s;he continued under the Engli&s;h Go|vernment, and the Magi&s;tracy of a <HI>Portreve,</HI> till the <HI>Norman</HI> ru&s;h'd in; yet the Title was not alter'd a good while after, when at la&s;t he came to be call'd <HI>Bayliffe,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>Provo&s;t: Richard</HI> the fir&s;t, for &s;upporting the <HI>Croy &s;ada,</HI> and his Warres in the Holy Land, got great Contributions of monies, from the <HI>Londoners;</HI> in lieu whereof, he gave them leave to choo&s;e two Bayliffs an|nually. King <HI>John</HI> after him chang'd their Bayliffs into a <HI>Maior,</HI> and two <HI>Sheriffs:</HI> To the&s;e <HI>Henry</HI> the third adds &s;ome <HI>Aldermen,</HI> who though yeerly E|legible at fir&s;t, grew afterwards Perpetual; Now, this Word <HI>Alderman,</HI> is con|&s;onant to <HI>Senator,</HI> being both derived from old Age and Gravity.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t <HI>Alderman</HI> we read of in <HI>England,</HI> was in the time of King <HI>Edgar,</HI> a|bout 800 years agoe, who&s;e name was <HI>Ailwine,</HI> and was de&s;cended of the blood Royal, as appeares by his Epitaph in that goodly Mona&s;tery, in the Ile of <HI>Ely,</HI> whereof he was founder him&s;elf, which Epitaph runs thus.
<Q><P>Hic requie&s;cit Dom. Ailwinus inclyti Regis Edgari Cognatus, totius Angliae Aldermannus, &amp; hujus Sacri coenobii miraculo&s;us Fundator.</P></Q></P>
<P>Here re&s;teth the Lord <HI>Ailwine</HI> (Cou&s;in to Noble King <HI>Edgar)</HI> Alderman of all <HI>England</HI> which &s;ome interpret chief Ju&s;tice, &amp; miraculous Founder of this holy Abbey. Hence it may be infer'd, that the appellation of <HI>Alderman,</HI> is not only venerable, but ancient, &amp; honourable. And from this Lord <HI>Ailwine,</HI> it &s;eemes the fir&s;t <HI>Maior</HI> of <HI>London</HI> de&s;cended, who was <HI>Henry Fitz-Alwin, Anno</HI> 1191. who continued many years in the Office, &amp; lies buried in St. <HI>Mary Bothaw,</HI> near <HI>Lon|don-&s;tone;</HI> and the next <HI>Maior</HI> to him was <HI>Roger Fitz-Alwin,</HI> after whom the Office grew annual.</P>
<P>The City being thus, in tract of time, come to a fixed and &s;etled Govern|ment, &s;he began to flouri&s;h exceedingly. And as &s;he increa&s;ed in Men, Manu|factures, and Merchandizing, &s;o the Kings did enlarge their royal favours unto Her, <HI>Anno 1220. Henry</HI> the third confirmed unto the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> free Warren, or liberty to hunt about the City, and in the Warren of <HI>Stanes;</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, that the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> &s;hould pa&s;&s;e Toll-free, through|out all <HI>England,</HI> and that the <HI>Keddles</HI> and <HI>Weres</HI> in the Rivers of <HI>Thames</HI> and <HI>Medway,</HI> &s;hould be plucked up and de&s;troyed for ever, becau&s;e Navigation to <HI>London</HI> might be more free. <HI>Roger Renger</HI> was Maior, when the&s;e Patents were granted. A few years after the liberties, and franchi&s;es of <HI>London,</HI> were ratified by the &s;ame King, who granted, that either <HI>Sheriff</HI> &s;hould have two <HI>Clarks,</HI> and two <HI>Sargeants,</HI> and that the Citizens &s;hould have a <HI>Common Seal:</HI> A little af|ter the &s;ame <HI>King</HI> granted that the <HI>Maior Elect,</HI> &s;hould be pre&s;ented to the <HI>Barons</HI> of the Exchequer, and they &s;hould admit him. Moreover, he gave way, that the City &s;hould be fortified with <HI>Po&s;ts,</HI> and Iron <HI>Chains,</HI> drawn athwart o|ver the &s;treets.</P>
<P><HI>Anno 1326. Edward</HI> the third much increa&s;ed the immunities of the City, and the Authority of the <HI>Maior;</HI> for he granted, that the <HI>Maior &s;hould be Ju|&s;tice for the Gaol delivery</HI> at Newgate, and have power to reprieve Pri&s;oners. That the Citizens of <HI>London</HI> &s;hould not be con&s;trained to go out of the City of <HI>London,</HI> to any Warre; He granted al&s;o, that the liberties and franchi&s;es of the City, &s;hould not after that time be taken into the <HI>Kings</HI> hands, as it had bin of|ten before, when a <HI>Cu&s;tos</HI> was put in. Moreover, He granted by Letters Pa|tents, that there &s;hould be no other <HI>E&s;chetor</HI> in the City, but the <HI>Maior.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1338. He granted, that the <HI>Sargeants</HI> attending the Maior and the Sheriffs, &s;hould bear <HI>Maces &s;ilver and gilt,</HI> with the Royal Arms engraven.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="25">
<HI>Anno</HI> 1356. The &s;ame King ordained, that whereas the <HI>Aldermen</HI> were u&s;ed to be chang'd <HI>yeerly,</HI> they &s;hould not be removed without &s;petial cau&s;e for the future. Then for the higher honour, and Authority of the Office, the Sword was added with the Cap of Maintenance.</P>
<P>Thus in proce&s;s of time, the Government of <HI>London,</HI> grew to be more and more e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1416. Sir <HI>Henry Barton</HI> being Maior, ordained <HI>Lanthorns and Lights</HI> to be hang'd out on the Winter Evenings, betwixt <HI>Alhollontide</HI> and <HI>Candlemas:</HI> Sir <HI>John Norman,</HI> being Maior, was the fir&s;t who went upon the River to <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter,</HI> having made a &s;tately <HI>Barge</HI> to that purpo&s;e, <HI>Anno</HI> 1453. And the re&s;t of the <HI>Companies</HI> followed that laudable Example, with their Barges al&s;o.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1473. Sir <HI>John Tate</HI> being Maior, the Sheriffs of <HI>London</HI> were appoin|ted each of them, to have <HI>&s;ixteen Serjeants,</HI> and every Serjeant to have his <HI>Yeoman;</HI> Moreover, they were to have <HI>&s;ix Clerks,</HI> a <HI>Secondary,</HI> a <HI>Clark of the Papers,</HI> with fower other Clarks, be&s;ides the <HI>Under Sheriffs</HI> Clark.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1484. It happened, that there was &s;ucce&s;&s;ively one after the other, three Mayors, and three Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> in the compa&s;&s;e of one year; by rea|&s;on of the &s;weating &s;ickne&s;s, which rag'd &s;o extreamly.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1501. Sir <HI>John Sha</HI> being <HI>Maior,</HI> added &s;ome &s;tate to the Office; for it was ordered, that the Aldermen his Brethren &s;hould attend him on Hor&s;e|back, from Guild-hall to the Rivers &s;ide, when he took Barge for <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> Be&s;ides, he was the fir&s;t who kept Court in his own Hou&s;e, for redre&s;&s;ing of &s;uch matters that came before him; Sir <HI>William Capel</HI> being Maior of <HI>London,</HI> caus'd <HI>Cages</HI> to be &s;et up in every Ward, for the puni&s;hments of <HI>Vagabonds,</HI> and <HI>Rogues. Anno</HI> 1556. Sir <HI>Thomas Offley</HI> being Mayor, the <HI>Night Bel-man</HI> was fir&s;t ordained.</P>
<P>Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> did much favour the City of <HI>London;</HI> and for the better Government thereof, gave way for a <HI>Provo&s;t Mar&s;hal</HI> to be appoin|ted.</P>
<P>Thus have we ob&s;erved, that the Governours in chief of the City of <HI>London,</HI> have had from time to time, differing appellations. Under the <HI>Britains,</HI> they were call'd Kings; The <HI>Romans</HI> &s;tiled them, <HI>Praefects.</HI> The <HI>Saxons, Portreves.</HI> The <HI>Norman</HI> Kings at their fir&s;t comming, <HI>Bayliffs,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>Provo&s;ts,</HI> Then came the Office to be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the Title of <HI>Maior,</HI> which hath conti|nued any time the&s;e 467. years, though it was interrupted &s;ometimes by a <HI>Cu&s;tos;</HI> which &s;ome of the Kings, as <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, upon a di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t the City, were u&s;ed to appoint.</P>
<P>This great <HI>Urban</HI> Magi&s;trate, the Maior of <HI>London,</HI> u&s;eth to be cho&s;en upon the fea&s;t of St. <HI>Michael the Archangel,</HI> every year out of the &s;ix and twenty Al|dermen, who are his Brethren; but he takes not his place, until the 28. of <HI>Octo|ber</HI> next following.</P>
<P>Touching the State and Authority of the Lord Maior of <HI>London,</HI> there is no <HI>Oppidan</HI> Magi&s;trate in Chri&s;tendom, all things well con&s;idered, lives in a grea|ter; Let us examine the particulars, and fir&s;t go to his dome&s;tical attendance, and the Officers thereunto belonging, which are, 1. A Sword-bearer. 2. Com|mon Hunt. 3. Common Cryer. And 4. Water Bayliffs, all E&s;quires by their places. Then is there the Coroner of <HI>London,</HI> three Sergeant Carvers, 3. Sar|geants of the Chamber; Sargeant of the Channel, 4 Yeomen of the Water &s;ide. The Under Water Bayliffe; two Yeomen of the Chamber, three Meal|weighers; two Yeomen of the Wood-Wharfs; and mo&s;t of the&s;e have their Servants allowed them; but the common Hunt&s;man and Water-Bayliffe, have two a peece; &s;ome of them have Liveries from the Lord Maior, and the re&s;t from the Chamber of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="26">
There be divers other great publick Officers belong to the Government of the City of <HI>London,</HI> as the two Sheriffs, which, like the Lord Maior, are but an|nual; The Recorder, the Chamberlain, the Common Sergeant, the Town-Clark, or common Clark, the Remembrancer, all E&s;quires.</P>
<P>The Sheriffs are cho&s;en upon Mid&s;ummer day: they formerly were u&s;ed to be elected out of the Commonalty; and &s;ometimes they came to be Aldermen, as many Aldermen were made <HI>Maiors,</HI> though not having bin <HI>Sheriffs;</HI> But of latter years, the Sheriffs have bin Aldermen before, or pre&s;ently after their E|lection; And 'tis remarkable, that <HI>Nicolas Faringdon</HI> was 4 times Maior of <HI>London,</HI> and yet never Sheriff.</P>
<P>Now touching the Election of the&s;e Officers, we &s;hall give a brief account, the prime Magi&s;trate, the Lord Maior and the Aldermen, met at Guild-hall at 8. in the morning, in their Scarlet Gowns, and their Cloaks fur'd riding on Hor&s;eback, and having bin a while in the Councel Chamber, they come forth into the Orphans Court, whence they go in their Cloaks to the Chappel, to hear Service and Sermon, where the Lord Maior, with &s;ome of the Alder|men, take the Communion, which being ended, and Offrings delivered, they return to the Councel Chamber, and thence to the <HI>Hustings,</HI> the highe&s;t Court; where the Recorder makes a Speech, touching the bu&s;ine&s;s in hand: then they go back to the Lord Maiors Court, where they remain, the doors &s;hut un|til the Election be brought unto them; Then the common Sargeant having the Sheriffs on either &s;ide, and the Sheriffs other Officers al out them, makes another Speech, touching the Cu&s;tom of the City in this kind; whereupon, they choo&s;e two, who&s;e names are brought up to the Lord Maior and the Al|dermen, who by &s;crutiny, elect one of tho&s;e two, whom the Commons had no|minated before. Then the Lord Maior returns to the <HI>Hu&s;tings,</HI> and he who is cho&s;en, goeth upon his left hand, and &s;itteth next him; Then the Recorder &s;peaks again to the Commons, nominating the per&s;on whom the Lord Maior, and the Aldermen had admitted, and demands whether it be their free choyce; the commons affirming it, the Sword-bearer goes to the Lord Maior, Elect, and taketh off his Tippet (which he takes for his fee) and puts on his Chain; where|upon, he making a &s;hort Speech of gratitude, the Lord Maior, and the new E|lect, go to the Elde&s;t Sheriffs Hou&s;e to dinner.</P>
<P>After dinner, the Lord Elect taking the Common Hunt, and other Officers to attend him, be&s;ides a Company of Aldermen, goeth to the Lord Keeper of the great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> where five or &s;ix Aldermen pre&s;ent him, wearing their Violet Gowns.</P>
<P>The morrow after <HI>Michaelmas day,</HI> the Lord Maior and the Aldermen go with the two new Sheriffs to the Exchequer-chamber in We&s;tmin&s;ter, where they are pre&s;ented and &s;worn, and the old Sheriffs are &s;worn al&s;o to their ac|count.</P>
<P>On <HI>Simon</HI> and <HI>Judes</HI> day, the Aldermen and Sheriffs attend the old Lord Maior at his Hou&s;e, whence they come in their formalities to the <HI>Hu&s;tings,</HI> where being &s;ate, the common Cryer commands &s;ilence: then the Town-Clark exhibites an Oath to the Lord Maior Elect, which being done, the for|mer Lord Maior giveth place to the New; which being done, the Chamberlain delivers him the Scepter, next the Keyes of the Common Seal; and la&s;tly, the Seal of the Majoralty; Then the Sword-bearer delivers him the Sword.</P>
<P>On the morrow after, all the Aldermen and Sheriffs &s;olemnly meet at the new Lord Maiors Hou&s;e, by 8. in the morning, whence they go to the Guild-Hall, and thence to the Vine-Tree, where they take Barge, and are rowed in &s;tate to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> the re&s;t of the chief Companies attending in their &s;e|veral Barges, with their Arms, Colours, and Streamers, in a very gay manner; Being come to the Hall, they go round about, and &s;alute all the Tribunals of
<PB N="37" REF="26">
ju&s;tice: then they a&s;cend to the <HI>Exchequer</HI> Chamber to the <HI>Barons,</HI> where af|ter the <HI>Recorder</HI> hath made a Speech, the Oath is admini&s;ter'd. Then they come down to the Hall, and go fir&s;t to the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> then to the <HI>Common Pleas,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey,</HI> where having walk'd about the <HI>Kings Tombs,</HI> they return to their Barges, and &s;o to <HI>London</HI> again; where, being landed, they go to the <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> where a mo&s;t plentifull dinner is prepared, which la&s;ts many hours, being called, <HI>the Lord Mayors fea&s;t;</HI> The Lords of the privy Councel, the Judges, with other Lords and Ladies of the be&s;t quality, are thither invited; After dinner, the Lord Mayor with all the Companies attending, ride &s;olemn|ly to Saint <HI>Pauls,</HI> to do their devotions; and &s;o the Ceremony of that great day is concluded.</P>
<P>Touching the Election of the <HI>Sheriffs,</HI> the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen meet at 8 in the morning at Guild-hall in their violet-colour'd Gowns, and their Cloaks of Scarlet lin'd but without hor&s;es; where from the <HI>Coun&s;el-</HI>Chamber, they go to the <HI>Orphans</HI> Court, &amp; &s;o to the <HI>Hu&s;tings,</HI> where the <HI>Recor|der</HI> having made a &s;peech touching the pre&s;ent meeting, the Mayor &amp; Aldermen go to the Mayors Court, the dores &s;hut upon them, then the Commons fall to the Election of <HI>Sheriffs,</HI> as al&s;o a <HI>Chamberlain,</HI> two <HI>Bridg-ma&s;ters,</HI> the <HI>Auditors</HI> of the City and <HI>Bridg-hou&s;e</HI> Accounts, and the <HI>Surveyors</HI> for Beer and Ale: which being done, the <HI>Sheriffs</HI> with the other Officers, the Common Cryer go|ing before them with his Mace, go up to the Lord <HI>Mayor</HI> and the <HI>Aldermen,</HI> to cary up the report of what is done at the <HI>Hu&s;tings,</HI> whither the Lord Mayor, and the Aldermen de&s;cend again, and confirm the Elections; Then the <HI>Recor|der</HI> making them a Speech of thanks, the meeting ends.</P>
<P>Now touching the <HI>Hu&s;tings,</HI> which we have mentioned &s;o often, it is the an|cient'&s;t and highe&s;t Court of the City of <HI>London;</HI> Touching the Etymology of it, it is a pure <HI>Saxon</HI> word, and is derived of <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> and <HI>dhing</HI> or <HI>thing,</HI> which among the <HI>Saxons</HI> &s;ignified a Cau&s;e or Plea; in &s;o much that <HI>Hu&s;tings</HI> is no other then the Hou&s;e of Cau&s;es, or Pleading; and <HI>Thingere</HI> was the ancient word for a Lawyer or Pleader; This Court pre&s;erves the Laws, Rights, Franchi&s;es, Cu&s;toms and Dignities of the City; There be handled al&s;o there the intricat'&s;t accounts, and Pleas of the Crowns, and of the whole Kingdom; which Court hath for ma|ny Ages, con&s;erv'd inviolably its own Prerogatives and Cu&s;toms. This Court was anciently held every Munday, but it was chang'd of late years into Tue&s;|day, becau&s;e of the Sheriffs intending the Market, which being kept upon Mun|day would hinder their &s;itting in the <HI>Hu&s;tings.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Edward the Confeffors</HI> Lawes refer much to this <HI>Hu&s;tings Court;</HI> Moreover, the Cities o <HI>York, Winche&s;ter, Lincoln,</HI> the I&s;le of <HI>Shepey,</HI> and other places, have had their <HI>Hu&s;tings.</HI></P>
<P>There is al&s;o another Court peculiar to <HI>London,</HI> which di&s;covers as much of <HI>Cha|rity,</HI> as of <HI>Policy:</HI> It is call'd the Court of <HI>Requests,</HI> or the Court of <HI>Con&s;cience.</HI> It was fir&s;t erected by an act of Common-Councel <HI>Anno 9. Henry</HI> 8. viz. <HI>That the Lord Mayor and Aldermen for the time being &s;hould monthly a&s;&s;ign two Aldermen, and four di&s;creet Commoners, to &s;it twice a week to hear, and determine all matters brought before them (betwixt Free-men) where the due debt, or dammage did not exceed</HI> 40s. Afterwards the &s;aid number of Commi&s;&s;ioners was en|crea&s;ed to the number of twelve, which continued till the end of Q. <HI>Elizabeths</HI> Reign; But, <HI>primo Jacobi,</HI> it was confirm'd by Act of Parliament, That the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould have power to exhibit an Oath, and to commit to pri|&s;on &s;uch as did not obey their Summons, or perform the Orders they made, be|twixt Plaintiff and Defendant, Debitor or Creditor, touching any debt, not amounting to forty &s;hillings; but &s;uch hath been the uncon&s;cionablene&s;&s;e and malice of &s;ome men of late times, that they have endeavour'd to overthrow the the &s;aid Court, by cavilling at &s;ome doubtful words therein, &amp; wre&s;ting them to a perver&s;e &s;en&s;e, the rich might have power thereby to oppre&s;&s;e the poorer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">orr,
<PB N="38" REF="27">
by bringing them to <HI>Westminster</HI> Hall to a further expence of time and trou|ble,</P>

In &s;o much that the City of <HI>London</HI> was not without a Bi&s;hop any time the&s;e thou&s;and years till now: The Prior of the holy Trinity at <HI>Ald|gate</HI> was a great man al&s;o in the Government of the City, for he u&s;ed to ride with the Mayor &amp; the Aldermen in robes; but the chief admini&s;tration of all <HI>Eccle&s;i|a&s;tical</HI> affairs was in the Bi&s;hop.

Then was <HI>Tower hill</HI> &s;ometimes a clear large plot of ground. but now pe&s;ter'd with encroachments of hou&s;es, built upon the banks of the ditch, much to the prejudice, and choaking up of the &s;aid ditch.</P>
<P>This Hill hath alwaies a Scaffold, and Gallowes erected for execution of Traytors and others, which the City oppo&s;ed at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Many cla&s;hings have been al&s;o 'twixt the Lord Mayor and the Lieutenant of the <HI>Tower</HI> about the extent of their Liberties, and &s;ome Priviledges touching pri&s;oners the Lievtenant claim'd, which were reconciled 1585; in Queen <HI>Elizabeths</HI> time at <HI>Non&s;uch.</HI></P>
<P>On the North&s;ide of Tower-hill, there is <HI>Lumly hou&s;e;</HI> then is <HI>Tower-&s;treet,</HI> &s;tretching from Tower-hill to Saint <HI>Margaret Pattens.</HI> At the end of this is the Pari&s;h Church called <HI>Alhallows Barking;</HI> on the North &s;ide whereof was &s;ometimes a fair Chappel, built by <HI>Richard</HI> the fir&s;t; and &s;ome &s;ay that his Heart (which is call'd <HI>Coeur de lion)</HI> was buried there under the high Altar; it became afterward a little Colledge of Prie&s;ts, and &s;tood till <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth. <HI>Henry Howard</HI> Earl of <HI>Surrey,</HI> being beheaded, was buried in <HI>Barking</HI> Church; <HI>John Fi&s;her</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Roche&s;ter,</HI> having layen naked upon the Scaffold a long time, was at la&s;t carried thither, and buried in the Churchyard; There were divers other men of note buried there: and lately Doctor <HI>Laud</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canter|bury,</HI> who was beheaded by the long Parliament.</P>

But the &s;aid Mona&s;tery, being afterwards pull'd down by Sir <HI>Arthur Darcy</HI> of late time, in place thereof is built a large &s;tore-hou&s;e for victual, with convenient Ovens, for baking of Bisket to &s;erve the <HI>Navy Royal;</HI> the re&s;t of the ground is become into &s;mal Tenements.</P>
<P>The Company of <HI>Marchant-Taylors,</HI> have built thereabouts, hard by <HI>Hog|&s;treet,</HI> divers fair Alms-hou&s;es for 14 poor women, and endow'd it with main|tenance accordingly.</P>
<P>We&s;tward hence from Tower hill towards <HI>Algate,</HI> there was a Mona&s;tery of Nunns of the Order of <HI>Santa Clara,</HI> call'd the <HI>Minories,</HI> founded by <HI>Edmund</HI> Earl of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> brother to <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, <HI>Anno</HI> 1293, which was demo|li&s;hed in <HI>Henry</HI> the eighths time, Dame <HI>Elizabeth Savage</HI> being then Abbe&s;&s;e: In the room of this Nunnery, there are now &s;tore-hou&s;es for Armour, and ha|billaments for war, with divers Work-hou&s;es to that purpo&s;e; and hard by, there is is a &s;mall Church, called Saint <HI>Trinity</HI> for the Inhabitants therea|bouts.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Third Ward, or Aldermanry, called <HI>Aldgate Ward.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_WE will &s;till look Ea&s;tward yet a good while, and go to the third Ward within the Walls, which is called <HI>Ealdgate</HI> Ward, or <HI>Aldgate,</HI> as taking name of the &s;ame gate; The principal &s;treet of this Ward beginneth at <HI>Ealdgate</HI> &s;tretching We&s;t to &s;ometime a fair Well, where now a Pump is placed; From thence (the way being divided into twain) the fir&s;t and princi|pal &s;treet, (called <HI>Aldgute)</HI> runneth on the South &s;ide to <HI>Lime-&s;treet</HI> corner, and half that &s;treet down on the left hand is al&s;o of that Ward.</P>
<P>In the mid way on that South &s;ide, betwixt <HI>Ealdgate</HI> and <HI>Lime-&s;treet,</HI> is Hart|horn Alley a way that goeth thorow into Fen-Church &s;treet, over again&s;t <HI>Nor|thumberland</HI> hou&s;e; Then have ye <HI>Brioklayers Hall,</HI> and another Alley called <HI>Sprinkle Alley,</HI> now named <HI>Suger-loaf-alley,</HI> of the like Sign.</P>
<P>Then is there a fair Hou&s;e with divers Tenements near adjoyning &s;ometimes belonging to a late di&s;&s;olved <HI>Priory,</HI> but &s;ince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by Mr. <HI>Cornwallies</HI> wid|dow, and her Heirs by the gift of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, in reward of fine pud|dings (as it was commonly &s;aid) by her made, wherewith &s;he had pre&s;ented him; &s;uch was the Princely liberality of tho&s;e times. Of later time, Sir <HI>Ni|cholas Thragmorton</HI> Knight, was log'd there.</P>
<P>Then &s;omewhat more We&s;t is <HI>Bahettars</HI> Lane, &s;o called of the fir&s;t Builder and owner thereof: now corruptly called <HI>Billiter</HI> lane; betwixt this <HI>Belzet|tens</HI> lane and <HI>Lime-&s;treet,</HI> was (of later time) a frame of three fair Hou&s;es, &s;et up in the year 1590, in place where before was a large Garden-plot, enclo&s;ed from the High-&s;treet with a Brick Wall, which Wall being taken down, and the ground digged deep for cellerage, there was found right under the &s;aid Brick Wall, another Wall of &s;tone with a Gate arch'd of &s;tone, and Gates of Timber, clo&s;ed in the midde&s;t towards the &s;treet; the Timber of the Gates was con&s;u|med, but the Hinges of Iron &s;till remained on, and their Staples on both the &s;ides.</P>
<P>Moreover in that Wall were &s;quare Windowes, with Bars of Iron on ei|ther &s;ide the Gate; this Wall was under ground above two fathoms deep, as it was e&s;teemed, and &s;eemed to be the ruines of &s;ome Hou&s;e burned in the Reign of King <HI>Steven,</HI> when the fire began in the Hou&s;e of one <HI>Aleward,</HI> neer <HI>Londons</HI> &s;tone, and con&s;umed Ea&s;t to <HI>Ealdgate,</HI> whereby it appeareth, how greatly the ground of this City hath been in that place rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the North &s;ide, this principal &s;treet &s;tretcheth to the We&s;t corner of Saint <HI>Andrews</HI> Church, and then the Ward turneth towards the North, by S. <HI>Mary</HI> &s;treet; on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, to St. <HI>Augu&s;tines</HI> Church in the Wall, and &s;o by <HI>Bur|ryes Markes</HI> again, or about by the Wall to <HI>Ealdgate.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;econd way from <HI>Ealdgate,</HI> more towards the South from the Pump afore|&s;aid, is called <HI>Fen-Church-&s;treet,</HI> and is of <HI>Ealdgate</HI> Ward, till ye come to <HI>Cull|ver Alley,</HI> on the We&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Ironmongers</HI> Hall; where &s;ometimes was a Lane, which went out of <HI>Fen-</HI>Church-&s;treet, to the midde&s;t of <HI>Lime-</HI>&s;treet, but this Lane was &s;topped up, for &s;u&s;picion of Thieves that lurked there by night.</P>
<P>Again, to <HI>Aldgate,</HI> (out of the principal &s;treet, even by the Gate and Wall of the City,) runneth a Lane South to <HI>Cro&s;&s;ed</HI> or <HI>Crouched-Fryers,</HI> and then

<HI>Woodroof</HI> Lane, to the Tower Hill; and out of this Lane We&s;t, a &s;treet called <HI>Hart-</HI>&s;treet, which of that Ward &s;tretcheth to <HI>Sydon-</HI>lane, by St. <HI>Olaves Church;</HI> one other Lane more We&s;t from <HI>Algate,</HI> goeth by <HI>Northumberland.</HI> Hou&s;e towards the <HI>Cro&s;&s;ed Fryars;</HI> then have you on the &s;ame &s;ide, the North end of <HI>Mars-lane,</HI> and <HI>Blanch-axelton</HI> or <HI>Chappleton,</HI> where that Ward en|deth.</P>
<P>Thus much for bounds.

<P>The &s;aid Queen gave al&s;o unto the &s;ame Church, and tho&s;e that &s;erved God therein, the plot of <HI>Aldgate,</HI> and the Soke or Tenements thereunto belonging, with all Cu&s;toms, &s;o free as &s;he had held the &s;ame, and 25 <HI>l.</HI> Blanks, which &s;he had of the City of <HI>Exeter,</HI> as appeareth by her Deed, wherein &s;he nameth the Hou&s;e of Chri&s;ts-Church, and reporteth <HI>Aldgate</HI> to be of her Demains, which &s;he granteth, with two parts of the rent of the City of <HI>Exce&s;ter. Norman</HI> took on him to be <HI>Prior</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;ts-Church</HI> in the year of Chri&s;t 1108, in the Pa|ri&s;hes of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> St. <HI>Michael</HI> St. <HI>Katherine,</HI> and the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Trini|ty,</HI> and was (in old time) of the holy <HI>Cro&s;&s;e,</HI> or holy <HI>Road</HI> Pari&s;h.</P>
<P>The <HI>Priory</HI> was builded on a piece of ground in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Katherine,</HI> towards <HI>Aldgate,</HI> which lyeth in length, betwixt the Kings-&s;treet, by the which men go towards <HI>Algate</HI> near to the Chappel of St. <HI>Michael</HI> towards the North, and containeth in length eighty three ells, half quarter, and half quartern of the Kings Iron eln, and lieth in breadth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Soke and Ward of <HI>Aldgate</HI> was then bounded, as I have before &s;hewn. The Queen was a mean al&s;o, that the Land and Engli&s;h <HI>Knighten-Guild</HI> was given unto the Prior <HI>Norman,</HI> and the hono|rable man <HI>Geffrey de Clinton,</HI> was a great helper therein, and obtained, that the Canons might enclo&s;e the way betwixt their Church and the Wall of the City, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This Priory in proce&s;&s;e of time, became a very fair and large Church, rich in Lands and Ornaments, and pa&s;&s;ed all the Priories in the City of <HI>London,</HI> or Shire of <HI>Middle&s;ex.</HI> The Prior whereof was an <HI>Alderman</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> to wit, of <HI>Port&s;oken</HI> Ward.</P>
<P>It is Recorded, that <HI>Eu&s;tacius</HI> the eighth Prior, about the year 1264, becau&s;e he would not deal with temporal Matters, in&s;tituted <HI>Theobald Fitz Ivonas</HI> Al|derman of the &s;aid <HI>Port&s;oken</HI> Ward under him; and that <HI>VVilliam Ri|&s;ing</HI> Prior of Chri&s;ts Church, was &s;worne Alderman of the &s;aid <HI>Port&s;o|ken</HI> Ward, in the fir&s;t of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd. The&s;e Priors have fitten and ridden among&s;t the Aldermen of <HI>London,</HI> in Livery like unto them, &s;aving that his habit was in &s;hape of a &s;pirituall per&s;on, at which time the Prior kept a mo&s;t bountiful hou&s;e of meat and drink, both for rich and poor, as well within the Hou&s;e as at the Gates, to all comers according to their e&s;tates and qualities.</P>
<P>But to take leave of this Priory: King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth minding to reward Sir <HI>Thomas Audley</HI> Speaker of the Parliament again&s;t Cardinal <HI>Wool&s;ey,</HI> as ye may read in the Chronicle, &s;ent for the Prior, commending him for his Ho&s;pitality, promi&s;ed him preferment as a man worthy of a far greater dignity, (which promi&s;e &s;urely he performed) and compounded with him, though in what &s;ort I never heard; &s;o that the Priory, with the appurtenances, was &s;ur|rendred
<PB N="54" REF="35">
to the King, in the month of <HI>July</HI> 1531, the 23 of the &s;aid Kings Reign, the Canons were &s;ent to other hou&s;es of the &s;ame Order: and the Priory with the appurtenances, King <HI>Henry</HI> gave to Sir <HI>Tho. Audley</HI> newly knighted, and afterwards made Lord Chancelour.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Thomas Audley</HI> offered the great Church of this Priory, with a ring of nine Bells well tuned (whereof four of the greate&s;t were &s;ince &s;old to the Pari&s;h of <HI>Stebunbith,</HI> and the five le&s;&s;er to the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Katherine</HI> Chri&s;ts-Church, in exchange for their &s;mall Pari&s;h Church, minding to have pulled it down, and to have builded there towards the &s;teeet; But the Pari&s;hioners, having doubts in their heads of after-claps, refu&s;ed the offer.</P>
<P>Then was the Priory Church and Steeple, proffered to whom&s;oever would take it down, and carry it from the ground, but no man would undertake the offer; whereupon, Sir <HI>Thomas Audley</HI> was fain to be at more charges than could be made of the Stones, Timber, Lead, Iron, &amp;c. For the Workmen, with great labour, beginning at the top, loo&s;ed &s;tone from &s;tone, and threw them down, whereby the mo&s;t part of them were broken, and few remained whole, &amp; tho&s;e were &s;old very cheap; for all the buildings then made about the City, were of Brick &amp; Timber; At that time any man in the City might have a Cart-load of &s;tone for paving brought to his door for <HI>6d.</HI> or <HI>7d.</HI> with the carriage.</P>
<P>The &s;aid <HI>Thomas,</HI> Lord <HI>Audley,</HI> builded and dwelt on this Priory during his life, and dyed there in the year 1544, &s;ince which time, the &s;aid Priory came (by Marriage of the Lord <HI>Audley's</HI> Daughter and Heir) unto <HI>Thomas</HI> Duke of <HI>Nor|folk,</HI> and was then called the <HI>Dukes-place.</HI> At this time the Inhabitants dwelling &amp; abiding in the &s;aid <HI>Dukes-place</HI> became utterly de&s;titute of any Pa|ri&s;h Church, for re&s;orting to Gods Divine &s;ervice, and the admini&s;tration of the ble&s;&s;ed Sacraments; which in the time of their former zeal, the demoli&s;hed Priory, not only &s;erv'd their u&s;e, but infinite numbers be&s;ides, re&s;orted thither. In which re&s;pect, the Pari&s;h Church of St. <HI>Katherine</HI> being &s;o near, and &s;tanding in the Coemitery or Church-yard of the late di&s;&s;olved Priory of the <HI>Holy Trini|ty,</HI> whereby it was called Saint <HI>Katherine Chri&s;ts-Church,</HI> they re&s;orted thither at the hours of Divine Service, and for the benefit of the ble&s;&s;ed Sacraments, whereby they became a burthen to the &s;aid Pari&s;h, yet well enough borne withal, in regard of the benefit en&s;uing by them, &s;o that they carried the re|&s;pect of equal pari&s;hioners, exerci&s;ing and accompli&s;hing all duties there, even as if it had been their own proper Pari&s;h.</P>
<P>The long continuance of them in this kind, although &s;ome much mi&s;liked, and gladly would have compa&s;&s;ed means for remedy thereof; yet their pow|er not &s;tretching &s;o far, nor the way (as yet) fitting for their purpo&s;e, they re|mained contented again&s;t their Wills, till time would fit them with more con|venient opportunity; Ground they wanted not, for rai&s;ing a &s;ufficient Pari&s;h Church to them&s;elves, neither did any good will fail in them for the effecting their purpo&s;e; but only were curbed by the lack of &s;trength, how and which way to bring it about. At length perceiving their ground (intended for &s;o good a u&s;e to them&s;elves) aimed at for buildings to private mens benefits, that &s;o they might be fru&s;trate of any &s;uch help, when occa&s;ion &s;hould in better man|ner &s;hine on them, &s;ome of the be&s;t advi&s;ed among them, by Petition &s;olicited the Lord Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> to make their de&s;ire and intention known to the King, which he did. And the King, finding the ca&s;e &s;o truly hone&s;t and religious, for new erecting a Church where &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity required, and where Super&s;tition had &s;o long time formerly been harboured, not only gave the Lord Archbi&s;hop and the Suitors, both thanks and commendation, but al&s;o under his Hand and broad Seal, authorizable Warrant for their proceeding. The Lord Mayor and Senate of Aldermen, having intelligence in the ca&s;e, and perceiving what an honour would redound thereby, fir&s;t to God who in&s;pired them there|to; next to the King, for &s;o Royally granting the &s;uite; and then to the City,

for furthering it to Effect, notwith&s;tanding that divers oppo&s;itions were made by them, who would have things &s;till continue, as formerly they did, without bene|fit of a Pari&s;h Church of their own. It proceeded on with good &amp; pro&s;perous &s;uc|ce&s;s, to the no mean Honour, and commendation of the Lord Maior then being, Sir <HI>Ed. Barkham</HI> by name, the Court of Aldermen, and &s;tate of this famous City by who&s;e good meanes it is made a very beautiful and comely Pari&s;h Church, it being called in the time of re-edifying, <HI>Trinity Chri&s;ts Church,</HI> rai&s;ed out of the long decayed ruines, of <HI>Trinity Priory</HI> in the <HI>Dukes place.</HI></P>
<P>By this time, the work is grown to &s;uch fulne&s;s and perfection, as now no|thing wanteth, but the windows glazing, which was performed in this manner,</P>
<P>The main and great Ea&s;t light in the Chancel, Sir <HI>Edward Barkham</HI> him&s;elf undertook, and effected it at his own Charge, as the expre&s;&s;ion te&s;tifieth in the &s;ame Window.

And then entring the Church, for&s;aking the Altar, to have &s;ung his High Ma&s;&s;e in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> upon a Tomb of the Dead, towards the North; But his Ser|mon at <HI>Pauls Cro&s;&s;e,</HI> took &s;uch effect, that in the Afternoon of that pre&s;ent Sunday, the Neighbors and Tenants to the &s;aid Bridge, over who&s;e doors, the &s;aid Shaft had lain, after they had dined (to make them&s;elves &s;trong) gathered more help, and with great labor, rai&s;ing the Shaft from the Hooks (whereon it had re&s;ted two and thirty years) they &s;awed it in pieces, every man taking for his &s;hare, &s;o much as had lain over his door and &s;hall, the length of his hou&s;e; and they of the Alley, divided among&s;t them, &s;o much as had lain over their Alley gate. Thus was his <HI>Idoll</HI> (as he termed it) mangled, and after bur|ned.</P>
<P>Soon after, was there a commotion of the Commons in <HI>Norfolk, Suffolk, E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and other Shires, by means whereof, &s;treight Orders being taken for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of rumors, divers per&s;ons were apprehended, and executed by <HI>Mar&s;hal</HI> Law; among&s;t the which, the Bayliffe of <HI>Rumford</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> was one, a man very well beloved: he was early in the morning of <HI>Mary Magdalens</HI> day (then kept Holy-day) brought by the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> and the Knight-Mar|&s;hall, to the Well within <HI>Aldgate,</HI> there to be executed upon a Gibbit, &s;et up that morning, where being on the Ladder, he had words to this effect;</P>

<P>In place of this Church, is now a Carpenters yard, a Tennis-Court, and &s;uch like: the Fryers Hall was made a Gla&s;&s;e-hou&s;e, or hou&s;e, wherein was made Gla&s;&s;e of divers &s;orts to drink in: which hou&s;e, in the year 1575. on the fourth of September, bur&s;t out into a terrible fire, where all meanes po&s;&s;ible being practi&s;ed to quench it, notwith&s;tanding, as the &s;ame hou&s;e in a &s;mall time be|fore, had con&s;umed a great quantity of Wood, by making of Gla&s;&s;es; Now it &s;elf, having within it about 40 000 Billets of Wood, was al&s;o con&s;umed to the &s;tone walls, which neverthele&s;s, greatly hindred the fire from &s;preading any further.</P>
<P>Adjoyning unto this Fryers Church, by the Ea&s;t end thereof in Woodroffe Lane, towards the Tower-Hill, are certain Almes-hou&s;es, 14. in number, buil|ded of Brick and Timber, founded by Sir <HI>John Milburn,</HI> Draper, &s;ometime Maior, 1521. wherein be placed 13. aged poor men, and their Wives: the&s;e have their dwellings rent-free, and 2 s. 4 d. a peece, the fir&s;t day of every Moneth for ever.</P>

More, he gave 2000 Marks upon a condition, which not performed, was then to be di&s;tributed to Maids Marriages, and other deeds of Charity: he al&s;o gave 3000 Marks to the Drapers, upon condition, that they &s;hould within one year after his decea&s;e, e&s;tabli&s;h perpetually a Ma&s;ter or Warden, five &s;ecular Prie&s;ts, &s;ix Clerks, and two Queri&s;ters, to &s;ing daily Divine Service, by note for ever, in this Chappel of the <HI>Leaden-hall;</HI> Al&s;o, one Ma&s;ter with an U&s;her for Grammar, one Ma&s;ter for Writing, and the third for Song, with Hou&s;es there newly builded for them for ever; the Ma&s;ter to have for his &s;alary, ten pounds, and every other Prie&s;t, eight pounds; every other Clarke, five pounds &s;ix &s;hil|lings eight pence; and every other Chori&s;ter, five Marks; and if the Drapers refu&s;ed this to do, within one year after his decea&s;e, then the three thou&s;and Marks to remain to the Prior and Covent of <HI>Chri&s;ts-Church</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> with con|dition to e&s;tabli&s;h things as afore&s;aid, within two years after his decea&s;e; And if they refu&s;ed, then the three thou&s;and Marks to be di&s;po&s;ed by his Executors, as they be&s;t could devi&s;e in works of Charity.</P>

<P>Touching the Chappel there, we find that in the year 1466, by Licence ob|tained of King <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, in the &s;ixth of his Reign, a Fraternity of the Trinity of 60 Prie&s;ts (be&s;ides other brethren and &s;i&s;ters) in the &s;ame Chappel, was founded by <HI>Rou&s;e, John Risby,</HI> and <HI>Thomas A&s;hby</HI> Prie&s;ts: &s;ome of the which &s;ix|ty Prie&s;ts, every Market-day, in the fore-noon, did celebrate Divine &s;ervice there, to &s;uch Market people as repaired to prayer, and once every year, they met altogether, and had &s;olemn Service, with proce&s;&s;ion of all the Brethren, and Si&s;ters; this foundation was in the year 1512, by a Common-Councel con|firmed to the &s;ixty Trinity Prie&s;ts, and to their Succe&s;&s;ors, at the will of the Mayor and Commonalty.</P>
<P>In the year 1484 a great fire happened upon <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> by what ca&s;ualty it was not known, but much hou&s;ing was there de&s;troyed, with all the Stocks for Guns, and other provi&s;ion belonging to the City, which was a great lo&s;&s;e, and no le&s;&s;e charge to be repaired by them.</P>
<P>In the year 1503. the eighteenth of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh, a reque&s;t was made by the Commons of the City, concerning the u&s;age of the &s;aid <HI>Leaden-Hall,</HI> in form as followeth;</P>
<P><Q>Plea&s;e it the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-Councel, to enact, that all Frenchmen bringing Canvas, Linnen cloth, and other Wares to be &s;old, and all Forreins bringing Wool&s;teads, Sayes, Stamins, Kiverings, Nayles, Iron work, or any other Wares, and al&s;o all Forreins, bringing Lead to the City to be &s;old, &s;hall bring all &s;uch their Wares afore&s;aid, to the open Market of the <HI>Leaden-Hall,</HI> and no where el&s;e to be &s;hewed, &s;old and uttered, like as of old time it hath been u&s;ed, upon pain of forfeiture of all the &s;aid Wares, &s;hewed or &s;old in any other place than afore&s;aid; And the &s;hew of the &s;aid
<PB N="61" REF="38">
Wares to be made three daies in a week, that is to &s;ay <HI>Monday, Tue&s;day,</HI> and <HI>Wedne&s;day;</HI> It is al&s;o thought rea&s;onable, that the common Beam be kept from henceforth in the <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> &amp; the Farmer to pay therefore rea&s;onable rent to the Chamber, for better it is, that the Chamber have advantage thereby, than a Forreign per&s;on; And al&s;o the &s;aid <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> which is more chargeable now by half than profitable, &s;hall better bear out the charges thereof; Al&s;o the common Beam for Wool at <HI>Leaden-hall</HI> may pay yearly a rent to the Chamber of <HI>London,</HI> toward the &s;upportation and charges of the &s;ame place: for rea&s;on it is, that a common Office occupied upon a common ground, bear a charge to the u&s;e of the Communalty; Al&s;o that Forrains bringing Wools, Felts, or any other Marchandizes or Wares to <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> to be kept there for the &s;ale and market, may pay more largely for keeping of their goods than Freemen. Thus much for the reque&s;t of the Commons at that time.</Q></P>
<P>Now to &s;et down &s;ome proof, that the &s;aid Hall hath been employed and u&s;ed as a Granary for Corn and grain (as the &s;ame was fir&s;t appointed) lea|ving all former examples, this one may &s;uffice, <HI>Roger Achley</HI> Mayor of <HI>London</HI> in the year 1512, the third of <HI>Henry</HI> the eight, when the &s;aid Mayor entred the Majoralty, there was not found one hundred quarters of Wheat in all the Garners of this City, either within the Liberties or near adjoyning, through the which &s;carcity, when the Carts of <HI>Stratford</HI> came laden with Bread to the City (as they had been accu&s;tomed) there was &s;uch pre&s;s about them, that one man was ready to de&s;troy another, in &s;triving to be &s;erved for their money; but this &s;carcity la&s;ted not long, for the Mayor (in &s;hort time) made &s;uch provi&s;i|on for Wheat that the Bakers, both of <HI>London,</HI> and of <HI>Stratford,</HI> were weary of taking it up, and were forced to take much more than they would, and for the re&s;t the Mayor laid out the money, and &s;tored it up in <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> and other Garners of the City; This Mayor al&s;o kept the Market &s;o well, that he would be at the <HI>Leaden-Hall,</HI> by four a clock in the Summer mornings, and from thence he went to other Markets to the great comfort of the Citi|zens.</P>
<P>We read al&s;o, that in the year 1528, the twentieth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, Sur|veyers were appointed to view the Garners of the City, namely, the <HI>Bridge-hou&s;e</HI> and the <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> how they were &s;tored of Grain for the &s;ervice of the City; And becau&s;e we have here before &s;poken of the Bread-carts coming from <HI>Strat|ford</HI> at the <HI>Bow,</HI> ye &s;hall under&s;tand, that of old time the Bakers of Bread at <HI>Stratford,</HI> were allowed to bring daily (except the Sabbath and principal Fea&s;ts) divers long Carts laden with bread, the &s;ame being two ounces in the penny wheaten loaf heavier than the penny wheaten loaf baked in the City, the &s;ame to be &s;old in Cheap, three or four Carts &s;tanding there 'tween <HI>Gutherans</HI> Lane, and <HI>Fau&s;ters</HI> Lane end, one Cart on <HI>Cornhil</HI> by the Conduit, and one other in <HI>Gra&s;&s;e-&s;treet;</HI> And we may read, that in the fourth year of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Richard Reffeham,</HI> being Mayor, a Baker named <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Stratford,</HI> for making Bread le&s;&s;er than the A&s;&s;ize, was with a fools hood on his Head, and loaves of Bread about his Neck, drawn on a hurdle through the &s;treets of the City.

<P>In the year 1519 a Petition was exhibited by the Commons to the Com|mon-Councel, and was by them allowed, concerning the <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> how they would have it u&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q><P>Meekly be&s;eeching, &s;heweth unto your good Lord&s;hip, and Ma&s;ter&s;hips, divers Citizens of this City, which (under correction) think, that the great place called the <HI>Leaden hall,</HI> &s;hould, nor ought not to be letten out to Farme, to any per&s;on or per&s;ons and in &s;pecial, to any fellow&s;hip or Company incor|porate, to have and hold the &s;ame Hall for term of years; for &s;uch convenien|ces as thereby may en&s;ue, and come to the hurt of the Common-weale of the &s;aid City in time to come, as &s;omewhat more largely may appear in the Articles following.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, if any a&s;&s;embly or ha&s;ty gathering of the Commons of the &s;aid City, for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing or &s;ubduing of mi&s;ruled people within the &s;aid City, hereafter &s;hall happen to be called or commanded by the Mayor, Aldermen, and other Governours and Councellors of the &s;aid City for the time being; there is none &s;o convenient, meet and nece&s;&s;ary a place to a&s;&s;emble them in, within the &s;aid City, as the &s;aid <HI>Leadon-hall,</HI> both for largene&s;&s;e of room, and for their &s;ure defence in time of their coun&s;elling together about the premi&s;es. Al&s;o, in that place hath been u&s;ed the Artillery, Guns, and other Armors of the &s;aid City, to be &s;afely kept in a readine&s;&s;e, for the &s;afegard, wealth, and defence of the &s;aid City to be had and occupied at times when need required. As al&s;o the &s;tore of Timber, for the nece&s;&s;ary reparations of the Tenements be|longing to the Chamber of the &s;aid City, there commonly hath been kept.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> If any Triumph or Noblene&s;&s;e were to be done, or &s;hewed by the Commonalty of the City, for the honour of our Soveraign Lord the King and Realm, and for the wor&s;hip of the &s;aid City, the &s;aid <HI>Leaden-hall</HI> is the mo&s;t meet and convenient place, to prepare and order the &s;aid Triumph therein, and from thence to i&s;&s;ue forth to the places thereof appointed.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> at any Large&s;&s;e or dole of any money, made unto the poore people of this City; it hath been u&s;ed to be done and given in the &s;aid <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> for that the &s;aid place is mo&s;t meet therefore.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> the honourable Father, that was maker of the &s;aid Hall, had a &s;peci|all will, intent, and mind, that (as it is commonly &s;aid) the Market men and women, that came to the City with victuals and other things, &s;hould have their free &s;tanding within the &s;aid <HI>Leaden-Hall</HI> in wet weather, to keep them&s;elves &amp; their Wares dry, and thereby to encourage them, and all other, to have the better will and de&s;ire, the more plentiou&s;ly to re&s;ort to the &s;aid City, to victual the &s;ame; And if the &s;aid Hall &s;hould be letten to Farme, the will of the &s;aid honourable Father, &s;hould never be fullfilled, nor take effect.</P>
<P><HI>Item,</HI> if the &s;aid place, which is the chief Fortre&s;&s;e, and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary place within all the City, for the tuition and &s;afegard of the &s;ame, &s;hould be letten out to Farme, out of the hands of the chief Heads of the &s;ame City, and e&s;pe|cially to any other Body politick, it might at length (by likelihood) be an occa&s;ion of di&s;cord and debate, between the &s;aid Bodies politick, which God defend.</P>
<P>For the&s;e, and many other great and rea&s;onable cau&s;es, which hereafter &s;hall be &s;hewed to this honourable Court, your &s;aid Be&s;eechers think it much nece&s;&s;ary, that the &s;aid Hall be &s;till in the hands of this City; and to be &s;urely kept by &s;ad and di&s;creet Officers in &s;uch wi&s;e, that it might alwaies be ready to be u&s;ed and occupied, for the Common-weale of the &s;aid City, when
<PB N="63" REF="39">
need &s;hall require, and in no wi&s;e to be letten to any Body politick. Thus much for the Petition.</P></Q>
<P>About the year one thou&s;and five hundred thirty four, great means was made about the <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> to have the &s;ame made a Bur&s;e for the A&s;&s;embly of Marchants, as they had been accu&s;tomed in <HI>Lumbard-&s;treet;</HI> many Common-Councels were called to that end, but in the year 1535, <HI>John Champneys</HI> being Mayor, it was fully concluded, that the Bur&s;e &s;hould remain in <HI>Lumbard &s;treet,</HI> as afore, and <HI>Leaden-hall</HI> no more to be &s;poken of concerning that matter.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of <HI>Leaden-hall</HI> was us'd to be thus; In a part of the North Quadrant, on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the North Gate, were the common Beams, for weigh|ing of Wooll and other Wares, as had been accu&s;tomed; On the We&s;t &s;ide of the Gate was the Scales to weigh Meal: the other three &s;ides were re&s;erved (for the mo&s;t part) to the making and re&s;ting of the Pageants &s;hewed at Mid-Sum|mer in the watch: the remnant of the &s;ides and Quadrants, were employed for the &s;towage of Wool-&s;acks, but not clo&s;ed up: the lofts above were partly u&s;ed by the Painters, in working for the decking of Pageants and other devices, for beautifying of the Watch and Watch-men: the re&s;idue of the Lofts were letten out to Marchants, the Wooll-winders and Packers therein, to winde and pack their Wools. And thus much for <HI>Leaden-hall</HI> may &s;uffice.</P>
<P>Now on the North of <HI>Lime&s;treet</HI> Ward, in the High&s;treet are divers fair hou|&s;es for Marchants, and proper Tenements for Artificers, with an Alley al&s;o cal|led <HI>Shaft Alley,</HI> of the Shaft or May-pole, &s;ometime re&s;ting over the Gate thereof, as I have declared in <HI>Aldgate Ward.</HI></P>
<P>In the year 1576. partly at the charges of the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> and part|ly at the charges of the Chamber of <HI>London,</HI> a water-pump, was rai&s;ed in the high &s;treet of <HI>Lime-&s;treet Ward,</HI> neer unto <HI>Lime-&s;treet</HI> corner, for the placing of the which Pump, having broken up the ground, they were forced to dig more than two fadome deep, before they came to any main ground, where they found a Hearth made of <HI>Britaine,</HI> or rather <HI>Romane</HI> Tyle, every Tyle half yard &s;quare, and about two inches thick, they found coal lying there al&s;o (for that lying whole will never con&s;ume) then digging one fadome in the main, they found water &s;ufficient, made their Prall, and &s;et up the Pump, which Pump, with oft repairing and great charges to the Pari&s;h, continued not four and twenty years, but being rotted, was taken up, and a new one &s;et in the place, in the year 1600. Thus much for the High-&s;treet.</P>
<P>In Saint <HI>Mary</HI> &s;treet had ye (of old time) a Pari&s;h Church of Saint <HI>Mary</HI> a Virgin, Saint <HI>Ur&s;ula,</HI> and the 11000 Virgins, which Church was commonly called Saint <HI>Mary at the Axe;</HI> of the Signe of an Axe, over again&s;t the Ea&s;t end thereof, or Saint <HI>Mary Pellipar,</HI> of a plot of ground lying on the North &s;ide thereof pertaining to the <HI>Skinners</HI> in <HI>London;</HI> This Pari&s;h about the year 1565. was united to the Pari&s;h Church of Saint <HI>Andrew</HI> Under Shaft, and &s;o was Saint <HI>Mary at the Axe</HI> &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and letten out to be a Ware-hou&s;e for a Mar|chant; Again&s;t the Ea&s;t end of this Church, was &s;ometime a &s;air Well, now turned to a Pump; Al&s;o again&s;t the North end of this Saint <HI>Mary</HI> &s;treet, was &s;ometime one other Pari&s;h Church of Saint <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> called Saint <HI>Augustine</HI> in the Wall, for that it &s;tood adjoyning to the Wall of the City, and other|wi&s;e called Saint <HI>Augu&s;tines Papey,</HI> or the poor, as I have read, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. About the year 1430, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, the &s;ame Church was allowed to the Brethren of the <HI>Papey,</HI> the Hou&s;e of <HI>poor Prie&s;ts,</HI> whereof I have &s;poken in <HI>Aldgate</HI> Ward, the Pari&s;hioners of this Church were appointed to the Pari&s;h Church of <HI>Alhallowes</HI> in the Wall, which is in <HI>Broad</HI> &s;treet Ward, and this Brotherhood called <HI>Papey,</HI> being &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the Church of Saint <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> was pulled down, and in place thereof one <HI>Grey</HI> Apothecary, builded a Stable, a Hay-loft, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is now a

<P>Now, becau&s;e there hath been &s;ome que&s;tion, to what Ward this Church of Saint <HI>Augu&s;tine Papey</HI> &s;hould of right belong, for the &s;ame hath been chal|lenged by them of <HI>Aldgate</HI> Ward, and (without rea&s;on) taken into <HI>Bi&s;hops-gate</HI> Ward, from <HI>Lime-street</HI> Ward, I am &s;omewhat to touch it.</P>
<P>About 70 years &s;ince, the Chamber of <HI>London,</HI> granted a Lea&s;e of groundly|ing near <HI>London</HI> Wall, in the Ward of <HI>Lime-&s;treet,</HI> from the We&s;t of the &s;aid Church or Chappel of Saint <HI>Augu&s;tine Papey,</HI> towards <HI>Bi&s;hops-gate &amp;c.</HI> on the which plot of ground, the Lea&s;ee builded three fair Tenements, and placed Te|nants there, the&s;e were charged to bear Scot and Lot, and &s;ome of them to bear Office in <HI>Lime &s;creet</HI> Ward, all which they did willingly without grudging; And when any &s;u&s;pected or di&s;ordered per&s;ons were by the Landlord placed there, the Officers of <HI>Lime &s;treet</HI> Ward, fetched them out of their Hou&s;es, committed them to Ward, procured their due puni&s;hments, and bani&s;hed them from thence; whereby in &s;hort time that place was reformed, and brought into good order, which thing being noted by them of <HI>Aldgate</HI> Ward, they moved their Alderman, Sir <HI>Thomas Offley,</HI> to call in tho&s;e Hou&s;es to be of his Ward; But Mr. <HI>Stow</HI> producing a fair Ledgier Book, &s;ometime pertain|ing to the late di&s;&s;olved <HI>Priory</HI> of the <HI>Holy Trinity</HI> within <HI>Aldgate,</HI> wherein were &s;et down the ju&s;t bounds of <HI>Aldgate</HI> Ward, before Sir <HI>Thomas Offley,</HI> Sir <HI>Rowland Hayward,</HI> the Common-Councel, and Ward-Mote Inque&s;t, of the &s;aid <HI>Lime &s;treet</HI> Ward, Sir <HI>Thomas Offley</HI> gave over his Challenge, and &s;o that matter re&s;ted in good quiet, until the year 1579. that Sir <HI>Richard Pype</HI> (being Mayor, and Alderman of <HI>Bi&s;hops-gate</HI> Ward) challenged tho&s;e Hou&s;es to be of his Ward, whereunto (without rea&s;on &s;hewed) Sir <HI>Rowland Hayward</HI> yeil|ded; and thus is that &s;ide of the &s;treet from the North corner of Saint <HI>Mary</HI> &s;treet, almo&s;t to <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate,</HI> (wherein is one plot of ground, letten by the Chamberlaine of London, to the Pari&s;h of Saint <HI>Martins Ote&s;wich,</HI> to be a Church-yard, or burying-place for the dead of that Pari&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.)</HI> un|ju&s;tly drawn and with-holden from the Ward of <HI>Lime-&s;treet,</HI> as Ma&s;ter <HI>Stow</HI> avoucheth.</P>

<P>Then have ye the late di&s;&s;olved <HI>Priory</HI> and Ho&s;pital, commonly called, <HI>Saint Mary Spittle,</HI> founded by <HI>Walter Brune,</HI> and <HI>Ro&s;ia</HI> his Wife, for Canons regu|lar, <HI>VValter,</HI> Arch Deacon of <HI>London,</HI> laid the fir&s;t &s;tone in the year 1197. <HI>VVil|liam</HI> of St. <HI>Mary Church,</HI> then Bi&s;hop of <HI>London,</HI> dedicated it to the honour of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and his <HI>Mother,</HI> the perpetual Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> by the name of <HI>Domus Des, and Beatae Mariae, Extra Bi&s;hop&s;gate,</HI> in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Buttolph,</HI> the bounds whereof, as appeareth by compo&s;ition between the Par&s;on, and <HI>Prior</HI> of the &s;aid Ho&s;pital; concerning Tithes, beginning at <HI>Berwards</HI> Lane, towards the South, and extendeth in breadth to the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Leonard</HI> of <HI>Sores-ditch,</HI> towards the North; and in length, from the <HI>Kings &s;treet</HI> on the We&s;t, to the <HI>Bi&s;hops of Londons</HI> field, called <HI>Lolle&s;worth</HI> on the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Prior</HI> of this St. <HI>Mary Spittle,</HI> for the immorti&s;ing and propriation of the Priory of <HI>Bikenacar</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> to his &s;aid hou&s;e of St. <HI>Mary Spittle,</HI> gave to <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>7th,</HI> four hundred pounds, in the two and twentieth of his Raign.</P>
<P>This Ho&s;pital &s;urrendred to <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>8th,</HI> was valued to di&s;pend four hun|dred &s;eventy eight pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> wherein was found, be&s;ides Ornaments of the Church, and other goods pertaining to the Ho&s;pital, one hundred eighty beds well furni&s;hed, for receipt of the poor; for it was an Ho&s;pital of great relief. Sir <HI>Henry Ple&s;ington</HI> Knight, was buried there, one thou&s;and four hundred fifty and two.</P>
<P>And here is to be noted, that time out of minde, it hath been a laudable Cu|&s;tome, that on good Friday in the After-noon, &s;ome e&s;pecial learned man, by appointment of the <HI>Prelates,</HI> &s;hould preach a Sermon at <HI>Pauls Cro&s;&s;e,</HI> treating of Chri&s;ts pa&s;&s;ion, and upon the three next Ea&s;ter Holydayes, Munday, Tue&s;|day, and Wedne&s;day, the like learned men, by the like appointment, have u|&s;ed to preach on the forenoons at the &s;aid <HI>Spittle,</HI> to per&s;wade the Article of Chri&s;ts Re&s;urrection; and then on Low Sunday, one other learned man at
<PB N="68" REF="42">
<HI>Pauls Cro&s;&s;e,</HI> to make rehear&s;al of tho&s;e four former Sermons, either commen|ding, or reproving them, as to him (by judgement of the learned Divines) was thought convenient; And that done, he was to make a &s;tudied Sermon of his own, which in all, were five Sermons in one; At the&s;e Sermons &s;o &s;everally preached, the Maior with his Brethren the Aldermen, were accu&s;tomed to be pre&s;ent in their Violets at <HI>Pauls,</HI> on good <HI>Friday,</HI> and in their Scarlets at the <HI>Spittle,</HI> in the Holydayes (except <HI>VVedne&s;day,</HI> in Violet) and the Maior with his Brethren on <HI>Low Sunday</HI> in Scarlet, at <HI>Pauls Cro&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Touching the Antiquity of this Cu&s;tom, I finde, that in the year one thou|&s;and three hundred ninety eight, King <HI>Richard</HI> having procured from <HI>Rome,</HI> confirmation of &s;uch Statutes, and Ordinances, as were made in the Parliament begun at <HI>VVe&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and ended at <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> he cau&s;ed the &s;ame confirma|tion to be read, and pronounced at <HI>Pauls Cro&s;&s;e,</HI> and at St. <HI>Mary Spittle,</HI> in a Sermon before all the People.</P>
<P><HI>Philip Malpas,</HI> one of the Sheriffs, in the year, one thou&s;and four hundred thirty nine, gave twenty &s;hillings by the year, to the three Preachers at the <HI>Spittle.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Stephen Foster</HI> Maior, in the year, 1594. gave 40 l. to the Preachers of <HI>Pauls Cro&s;&s;e</HI> and <HI>Spittle.</HI> We find al&s;o, that the afore&s;aid Hou&s;e, wherein the Maior and Aldermen do &s;it at the Spittle, was builded (for that purpo&s;e) of the goods, and by the Executors of <HI>Richard Raw&s;on,</HI> Alderman, and <HI>I&s;abel</HI> his Wife, in the year 1488.</P>
<P>In the year 1594. this Pulpit being old, was taken down, and a new one &s;et up: the Preachers face turned towards the South, which was before towards the We&s;t. Al&s;o a large Hou&s;e (on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;aid Pulpit) was then builded, for the Governours and Children of <HI>Chri&s;ts Ho&s;pital</HI> to &s;it in; and this was done of the goods of <HI>William Elkin,</HI> Alderman before decea&s;ed; But with|in the fir&s;t year, the &s;ame Hou&s;e decaying, and like to have fallen, was again (with great co&s;t) repaired at the Cities Charge.</P>
<P>On the Ea&s;t &s;ide of this Church-yard, lyeth a large field, of old time called <HI>Lole&s;worth,</HI> now <HI>Spittle-field,</HI> which about the year, 1576. was broken up, for Clay to make Brick: in the digging thereof, many Earthen Pots called <HI>Urnae,</HI> were found full of A&s;hes, with burnt bones of men, to wit, of the Romans that inhabited here; for it was the Cu&s;tom of the Romans, to burn their dead, to put their A&s;hes in an Urn, and then bury the &s;ame with certain Ceremonies, in &s;ome field appointed for that purpo&s;e near unto their City; and commonly, there was another Urn of fre&s;h water, laid by the other, denoting the teares of their friends.</P>
<P>Every of the&s;e Pots had in them (with the A&s;hes of the Dead) one piece of Copper money, with the In&s;cription of the Emperor then reigning, &s;ome of them were of <HI>Claudius,</HI> &s;ome of <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> &s;ome of <HI>Nero,</HI> of <HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> of <HI>Trajanus,</HI> and others; Be&s;ides tho&s;e Urns, many other Pots were found in the &s;ame place, made of a white Earth, with long necks, and handles, like to our &s;tone Jugs: the&s;e were empty, but &s;eemed to be buried full of &s;ome liquid mat|ter, long &s;ince con&s;umed, and &s;oked through; For there were found divers Vi|als, and other fa&s;hioned Gla&s;&s;es; &s;ome mo&s;t cunningly wrought, and &s;ome of Cry&s;tal, all which had water in them (which it &s;eems were the teare-Bottles) nothing differing in clearne&s;s, ta&s;t, or &s;avour from common Spring water, what|&s;oever it was at the fir&s;t; Some of the&s;e Gla&s;&s;es had Oyl in them very thick, and earthy in &s;avour; &s;ome were &s;uppo&s;ed to have balm in them, but had lo&s;t the vertue; many of the&s;e Pots and Gla&s;&s;es were broken in cutting of the Clay, &s;o that few were taken up whole.</P>
<P>There were al&s;o found divers Di&s;hes and Cups, of a fine red coloured Earth, which &s;hewed outwardly &s;uch a &s;hining &s;moothne&s;s, as if they had been of Curral; Tho&s;e had (in the bottoms) <HI>Roman</HI> letters printed: There were al&s;o
<PB N="69" REF="42">
Lamps of white Earth and red, artificially wrought with divers Antiques about them, &s;ome three or four Images, made of white Earth, about a &s;pan long each of them; one was of <HI>Pallas.</HI> Among&s;t divers of tho&s;e Antiquities, there was found one Urn, with A&s;hes and Bones, and one pot of white Earth, very &s;mall, not exceeding the quantity of a quartern of a Wine pint, made in &s;hape of a Hare &s;quatted upon her leggs, and between her Eares is the mouth of the Pot.</P>
<P>There hath al&s;o bin found (in the &s;ame field) divers Coffins of &s;tone, con|taining the bones of men; the&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e to be the Burials of &s;ome &s;pecial per|&s;ons, in time of the <HI>Britons,</HI> or <HI>Saxons,</HI> after that the <HI>Romans</HI> had left to govern here.</P>
<P>Moreover, there were al&s;o found the &s;culls and bones of men, without Coffins; or rather, who&s;e Coffins (being of Timber) were con&s;umed; divers great Nails of Iron were there &s;ound, &s;uch as are u&s;ed in the Wheels of &s;hod Carts; being each of them as big as a mans finger, and a quarter of a yard long; the heads two inches over: Tho&s;e nayles were more wondred at, then the re&s;t of the things there found; and many Opinions of men were there pa&s;&s;ed upon them; namely, that the men there buried, were murthered by driving tho&s;e nayles into their heads.</P>
<P>But to &s;et down what was ob&s;erved, concerning this matter; there were there, the bones of a man lying, the head North, the feet South, and round a|bout him (athwart his head) along both his &s;ides, and thwart his feet &s;uch nails were found; wherefore it may be conjectured, they were the nayls of his Coffin, which had bin a trough cut out of &s;ome great Tree; and the &s;ame co|vered with a Plank of that thickne&s;s, fa&s;tened with &s;uch nayls, and found under the broad heads of &s;ome of tho&s;e nayls, the old Wood was found &s;cant turned into Earth; but &s;till retaining both the grain and proper colour. And thus much for that part of <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate-</HI>Ward; now we will proceed to that part which lyeth within the <HI>Gate.</HI></P>
<P>And fir&s;t, to begin on the left hand of <HI>Bishop&s;gate;</HI> from the <HI>Gate</HI> ye have certain Tenements of old time, pertaining to a Brother-hood of St. <HI>Nicholas,</HI> granted to the Pari&s;h Clarks of <HI>London,</HI> for two Chaplains to be kept in the Chappel of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> near unto the <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> in the 27. of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth.

<P>This Brother-hood (among&s;t other) being &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, in the Raign of <HI>Ed|ward</HI> the &s;ixth: the &s;aid Hall, with the other Buildings there, was given to Sir <HI>Robert Chester,</HI> a Knight of <HI>Cambridge-shire,</HI> again&s;t whom the Pari&s;h-Clarks commencing &s;uit, in the Raign of Queen <HI>Mary;</HI> and being like to have pre|vailed, the &s;aid Sir <HI>Robert Che&s;ter</HI> pulled down the Hall, &s;old the Timber, &s;tone, and Lead; and thereupon the &s;uit was ended.

<P>The &s;mall &s;pired Steeple of this Church was overthrown by tempe&s;t of wind, in the year one thou&s;and three hundred &s;ixty two, but was rai&s;ed of new, as &s;till it might have &s;tood, had not private benefit (the only devourer of Antiquity) pull'd it down.</P>
<P>Both that goodly Steeple, and all that Ea&s;t part of the Church, hath lately been taken down, and Hou&s;es (for one mans commodity) rai&s;ed in the place, whereby <HI>London</HI> hath lo&s;t &s;o goodly an ornament, and times hereafter may more talk of it.</P>
<P>This Hou&s;e was valued at fifty &s;even pounds, and was &s;urrendred the twelfth of <HI>November,</HI> the 13 of <HI>Henry</HI> the 8. There were many great Monuments in this Fryers Church, one of <HI>Edmond</HI> fir&s;t &s;on to <HI>Joan</HI> mother to <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;e|cond, <HI>Guy de Meryke</HI> Earl of Saint <HI>Paul, Lucie</HI> Counte&s;&s;e of <HI>Kent, Richard</HI> the great Earl of <HI>Arundel, Surrey,</HI> &amp; <HI>VVarren,</HI> Sir <HI>Francis Atcourt</HI> Earl of <HI>Pembrooke,

<P>On the South &s;ide, and at We&s;t end of this Church, many fair hou&s;es are builded; namely in <HI>Throgmorton</HI> &s;treet, one very large and &s;pacious, builded in the place of old and &s;mall Tenements, by <HI>Thomas Cromwel,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Kings Jewel-hou&s;e, after that, Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Rolls,</HI> then Lord <HI>Cromwell</HI> Knight, Lord Privie Seal, Vicar General, Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> high Chamberlain of <HI>England, &amp;c.</HI> This hou&s;e being fini&s;hed, and having &s;ome rea&s;onable plot of ground left for a Garden, he cau&s;ed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ales of the Gardens adjoyning to the North part thereof, on a &s;udden to be taken down, two and twen|ty foot to be mea&s;ured forth-right into the North of every mans ground, a Line there to be drawn, a Trench to be ca&s;t, a foundation laid and an high Brick Wall to be builded; and this was &s;uddenly and no warning given, nor other an&s;wer, but (when any &s;pake to the Surveyers of that work) they &s;aid their Ma&s;ter Sir <HI>Thomas</HI> commanded them &s;o to do; &s;o that no man dur&s;t go to argue the matter, but each man lo&s;t his Land; Thus the &s;udden ri&s;ing of &s;ome men, cau&s;eth them to forget them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Company of <HI>Drapers</HI> in <HI>London</HI> bought this Hou&s;e, and now the &s;ame is their Common Hall. This Company obtained of King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, in the &s;eventeenth of his Reign, to be incorporate. <HI>John Gedney</HI> was cho&s;en to be their fir&s;t Ma&s;ter, and the four Wardens were, <HI>John VP otton, J.

<P>The one and twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, <HI>Thomas Holm,</HI> ali&agrave;s <HI>Clarentiaux</HI> King of Armes for the South part of <HI>England,</HI> granted by his Patents to the &s;aid Fraternity and Guild of Saint <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> of <HI>Taylors</HI> and <HI>Linnen Armorers,</HI> to bear in a field Silver, a Pavilion between two Mantles Imperial, Purple, garni&s;hed with Gold, in a chief Azure, a holy Lamb, &s;et within a Sun, the Cre&s;t upon the Helm; a Pavilion purple, garni&s;hed with Gold, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

Which &s;aid <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, in the twentieth of his Reign, gave unto <HI>John Carpenter,</HI> Dr. of Divinity, and Ma&s;ter of St. <HI>Anthonies</HI> Ho&s;pital, and to his Brethren, and their Succe&s;&s;ors for ever, his Mannor of <HI>Pomington,</HI> with the appurtenances, with certain Pen&s;ions, and Portions of <HI>Milburn, Burneworth, Charleton,</HI> and <HI>Up-Wimburn,</HI> in the County of <HI>Southhampton,</HI> towards the maintenance of five Scholars in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford,</HI> to be brought up in the faculty of Arts, af|ter the rate of ten pence the week for every Scholar; &s;o that the &s;aid Scholars be fir&s;t in&s;tructed in the rudiments of Grammar, at the Colledge of <HI>Eaton,</HI> foun|ded by the &s;aid King.</P>
<P>In the year 1474. <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>4th</HI> granted to <HI>William Say,</HI> Batchelor of Di|vinity, Ma&s;ter of the &s;aid Ho&s;pital, to have Prie&s;ts, Clerks, Scholars, poor men, and Brethren of the &s;ame, Clerks, or Laymen, Queri&s;ters, Procters, Me&s;&s;engers, Servants in Hou&s;hold, and other things what&s;oever, like as the Prior, and Co|vent of St. <HI>Anthonies</HI> of <HI>Vienna, &amp;c.</HI> He al&s;o annexed, united, and appropriated the &s;aid Ho&s;pital, unto the Collegiate of St. <HI>George</HI> in <HI>Wind&s;or.</HI></P>
<P>The Protectors of this Hou&s;e, were to collect the benevolence of charitable Per&s;ons, towards the building and &s;upporting thereof.</P>

<P><HI>Walter Champion,</HI> Draper, one of the Sheriffs of <HI>London,</HI> 1529. was buried there, and gave to the Beadmen twenty pounds, The Lands by year of this Ho&s;pital, were valued in the 37. of King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, to be 55 l. 6 s. and 8. pence.</P>
<P>One <HI>John&s;on</HI> (a Schoolma&s;ter of the famous Free-School there) became a prebend of <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and then (by little and little) followed the &s;poil of this Ho&s;pital: he fir&s;t di&s;&s;olved the Quire, conveyed away the Plate and Ornaments, then the Bels; and la&s;tly, put out the Alms men from their hou&s;es, appoin|ting them portions of twelve pence the week to each; but now I hear of no &s;uch matter performed; for their hou&s;es, with other, be letten out for rent, and the Church is a preaching place for the French Nation, as was touched before.</P>
<P>This School was commended in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, and &s;ithence commended above other; but now decayed, and come to nothing, by taking that from it, which thereunto belonged.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Seventh Ward, or Aldermanry of the City of <HI>London,</HI> called <HI>Corn-hill Ward.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOw <HI>Cornhil</HI> Ward comes to con&s;ideration, corruptly called <HI>Cornwel</HI> by the vulgar; It was called <HI>Corn-hill</HI> of a Corn-Market, time out of mind there holden, and is a part of the principal high &s;treet, begin|ning at the We&s;t end of <HI>Leaden-Hall,</HI> &s;tretching down We&s;t, on both the &s;ides, by the South end of <HI>Finkes Lane,</HI> on the right hand, and by the North end of <HI>Birchoven</HI> Lane, on the left part: of which Lanes, to wit, to the middle of them, is of this Ward, and &s;o down to the Stocks Market; and this is the bounds. The upper or Ea&s;t part of this Ward, and al&s;o a part of <HI>Lime&s;treet</HI> Ward, hath been (as I &s;aid) a Market-place, e&s;pecially for Corn, and &s;ince for all kind of Victuals, as is partly &s;hewed in <HI>Limestreet</HI> Ward.</P>
<P>It appeareth by Record, that in the year 1522. the <HI>Rippiers</HI> of Rie and other places, &s;old their fre&s;h Fi&s;h in <HI>Leaden-hall</HI> Market upon <HI>Cornhill;</HI> but forraign Butchers were not admitted there to &s;ell Fle&s;h, till the year 1533.</P>
<P>And it was enacted, that Butchers &s;hould &s;ell their Bief, not above a half peny the pound; and Mutton, half peny, half farthing: which Act being de|vi&s;ed, for the great Commodity of the Realm, (as it was then thought) hath &s;ince proved far otherwi&s;e; for, before that time, a fat <HI>Oxe</HI> was &s;old at <HI>London,</HI> for &s;ix and twenty &s;hillings eight pence, at the mo&s;t; a fat <HI>Weather,</HI> for three &s;hillings four pence; a fat Calf at the &s;ame price; a fat Lamb for twelve pence; pieces of Bief weighing, 2. pounds and a half at the lea&s;t, yea, 3. pound or better for a peny, on every Butchers Stall in this City; and of tho&s;e pieces of Bief, 13, or fourteen for twelve pence; fat Mutton for eight pence the quarter; and one hundred weight of Bief, for four &s;hillings eight pence, at the deare&s;t.</P>
<P>What the price is now, I need not &s;et down; many men thought the &s;ame Act to rai&s;e the price, <HI>by rea&s;on that Gra&s;iers knew, or &s;uppo&s;ed what weight every their Bea&s;ts contained;</HI> and &s;o rai&s;ing their price thereafter, the Butcher could be no gainer, but by likewi&s;e rai&s;ing his price: the number of Butchers then in the City and Suburbs, was accounted &s;ix&s;core, of which every one killed &s;ix Oxen a peece weekly, which is in forty &s;ix weeks, 33120. Oxen, or &s;even hun|dred and twenty Oxen weekly.</P>
<P>The forraign Butchers (for a long time) &s;tood in the high &s;treet of <HI>Lime&s;treet-</HI>Ward, on the North &s;ide, twice every week, <HI>viz,</HI> Wedne&s;dayes and Saturdayes, and were &s;ome gain to the Tenants, before who&s;e doors they &s;tood, and into

who&s;e hou&s;es they &s;et their blocks and &s;talls; but that advantage being e&s;pied, they were taken into <HI>Leaden-Hall,</HI> there to pay for their &s;tanding to the Cham|ber of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much for the Market upon <HI>Cornhill.</HI></P>
<P>The chief Ornaments in <HI>Cornhill-VVard,</HI> are the&s;e;</P>

<P>On the North &s;ide of this &s;treet, from the Ea&s;t unto the We&s;t, have ye divers fair hou&s;es, for Marchants and others; among&s;t the which, one large Hou&s;e is called the <HI>Wey-hou&s;e,</HI> where Marchandizes brought from beyond the Seas, are to be weighed at the Kings Beame: this Hou&s;e hath a Ma&s;ter, and under him four Ma&s;ter-Porters, with Porters under them, they have a &s;trong Cart, and four great Hor&s;es, to draw and carry the Wares from the Marchants Hou&s;es to the Beam, and back again; Sir <HI>Thomas Lovel,</HI> Knight, builded this Hou&s;e, with a fair front of Tenements, toward the &s;treet, all which he gave to the <HI>Grocers</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> him&s;elf being free of the City, and a Brother of that Com|pany.</P>

<P>In the year 1570. on the 23. of January, the Queens Maje&s;ty, attended with her Nobility, came from her Hou&s;e at the Strand, called <HI>Sommer&s;et-Hou&s;e,</HI> and entred the City by Temple-Barre, through Fleet-&s;treet, Cheape, and &s;o by the North &s;ide of the Bur&s;e, through Thredneedle-&s;treet, to Sir <HI>Thomas Greshams</HI> Hou&s;e in Bi&s;hop gate-&s;treet, where &s;he dined: After dinner, her Maje&s;ty returning through Corn-hill, entred the Bur&s;e on the South &s;ide; and after &s;he had viewed every part thereof above the ground, e&s;pecially the <HI>Pawne,</HI> which was richly fur|ni&s;hed with all &s;orts of the fine&s;t Wares in the City, &s;he cau&s;ed the &s;ame <HI>Bur&s;e,</HI> by an Haurald and a Trumpet, to be proclaimed at the <HI>Royal Exchange,</HI> and &s;o to to be called from thenceforth, and not otherwi&s;e.</P>

<P>The Roof of this Church and Glazing, was fini&s;hed in the Reign of King <HI>Ed|ward</HI> the fourth, as appeareth by Armes of Noble men, and Aldermen of <HI>Lon|don</HI> then living.

<P>BE it known unto all men, that the year of our Lord God 179, <HI>Lucius</HI> the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian King of this Land, then called <HI>Britaine,</HI> founded the fir&s;t Church in <HI>London,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Church of St. <HI>Peter</HI> upon <HI>Cornhill;</HI> and he founded there an <HI>Archbi&s;hops See,</HI> and made that Church the Metropolitan and chief Church of this Kingdom, and &s;o endured the &s;pace of four hundred years, unto the coming of St. <HI>Au&s;tin, the Apo&s;tle of the Engli&s;h,</HI> the which was &s;ent into this Land by St. <HI>Gregory</HI> the Doctor of the Church, in the time of King <HI>Ethilbert;</HI> And then was the Archbi&s;hops <HI>See,</HI> and <HI>Pall,</HI> removed from the fore&s;aid Church of St. <HI>Peter</HI> upon <HI>Cornhill,</HI> unto <HI>Doreburniam</HI> that now is called <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and there remaineth to this day.

For, there is &s;ome cau&s;e, why the Metropolitane Church &s;hould be thought to &s;tand where St. <HI>Peters</HI> now doth, by the &s;pace of four hundred and od years, be|fore it was removed to <HI>Canterbury</HI> by <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> the Monk, if a man would lean to one &s;ide without any conference of the a&s;&s;everations of the other; But herein there may lurk &s;ome &s;cruple; for, be&s;ides that St. <HI>Peters</HI> Church &s;tood in the Ea&s;t end of the City, and that of <HI>Apollo</HI> in the We&s;t; the word <HI>Cornhil,</HI> a deno|mination given of late (to &s;peak of) to one &s;treet, may ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken for <HI>Thorney.</HI></P>

<P>And now to return where we left; True it is, that a Library there was, per|taining to this Pari&s;h Church, of old time builded of Stone, and of late repaired with Brick, by the Executors of Sir <HI>John Crosby</HI> Alderman, as his Arms on the South end do witne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>This Library hath been (of late time) to wit within this &s;eventy years, well furni&s;hed of Books, <HI>John Leyland</HI> viewed and commended them: but now tho&s;e Books are gone, and this place is occupied by a School-ma&s;ter, and his U&s;her, for a number of Scholers learning their Grammer Rules, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding before that time, a Grammar School had been kept in this Pari&s;h, as appeareth in the year a thou&s;and four hundred twenty five.</P>
<P>We read, that <HI>John Whitby</HI> was Rector, and <HI>John Steward</HI> School-ma&s;ter there; and in the five and twentieth of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, it was Enacted by Par|liament, that four Grammer Schools in <HI>London,</HI> &s;hould be maintained, <HI>viz</HI> In the Pari&s;hes of <HI>Alhallowes</HI> in <HI>Thames</HI> &s;treet, Saint <HI>Andrew</HI> in <HI>Oldburn,</HI> Saint <HI>Peters</HI> upon <HI>Cornhill,</HI> and Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Acres.</HI></P>

<P>The fair new Steeple or Bell-Tower of this Church, was begun to be builded in the year 1421, which being fini&s;hed, and a fair ring of five Bells therein placed, a &s;ixth Bell was added, and given by <HI>John VVhitwell, I&s;abel</HI> his Wife, and <HI>William Rus,</HI> or <HI>Rous</HI> Alderman, and Gold&s;mith, about the year 1430, which Bell named <HI>Rus,</HI> (nightly at eight of the clock, and otherwi&s;e for Knels, and in Peals, rung by one man by the &s;pace of 160 years) of late over-haled by four or five at once, hath been thrice broken, and new ca&s;t, within the &s;pace of ten years, to the charges of that Pari&s;h more than 100 marks.</P>

<P>And to prove this <HI>East-Cheape</HI> to be a place repleni&s;hed with Cooks, it may appear by a Song, called <HI>London lick-penny,</HI> made by <HI>Lidgate,</HI> a Monk of <HI>Bury,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, in the per&s;on of a Country-man, comming to <HI>London,</HI> and travelling thorough the &s;ame.

<P>After this, in the &s;ame year, the &s;aid Sir <HI>William Walworth,</HI> founded in the &s;aid Pari&s;h Church of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> a Colledge, of a Ma&s;ter and nine Prie&s;ts, or Chaplains, and decea&s;ing 1385. was there buried in the North Chappel by the Quire; but his Monument being (among&s;t other by bad people) defaced in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth; and again, &s;ince renewed by the Fi&s;hmongers, for lack of knowledge, what&s;oever before had been written in this Epitaph, they followed a fabulous Book, and wrote <HI>Jack Straw,</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>Wat Tylar.</HI></P>
<P>It hath al&s;o been, and is now grown to a common opinion, that in reward of this &s;ervice done by the &s;aid <HI>William Wallworth,</HI> again&s;t the Rebel, that King <HI>Richard</HI> added to the Arms of this City (which was Argent, a plane Cro&s;&s;e Gules) a Sword, or Dagger, (for &s;o they terme it) whereof Mr. <HI>John Stow</HI> makes a doubt; but to the contrary, he alledgeth, that in the fourth year of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, in a full A&s;&s;embly made in the upper.

<P>THe Wards &s;poken of hitherto may be&s;aid to lye on the Ea&s;t.

Whereby it appears, that in tho&s;e daies, (and till of late times) every man lived according to his own profe&s;&s;ed Trade, not any one interrupting another; The Cooks dre&s;&s;ed meat, and &s;old no Wine; and the Taverner &s;old Wine, but dre&s;&s;ed no meat for &s;ale, &amp;c.</P>
<P>This Ward beginneth in the Ea&s;t, at the We&s;t end of <HI>Downgate</HI> Ward, at the Water-cour&s;e of <HI>Walbrook,</HI> which parteth them, to wit, at <HI>Granthams</HI> Lane on the Thames &s;ide, and at <HI>Elbow-</HI>Lane on the Lands &s;ide, it runneth along in <HI>Thames</HI> &s;treet We&s;t, &s;ome three hou&s;es beyond the <HI>Old Swana</HI> Brew-hou&s;e; and on the Land &s;ide, &s;ome three Hou&s;es We&s;t, beyond Saint <HI>James</HI> at <HI>Garlick Hithe.</HI></P>

Moreover, no Sacks were &s;old, but <HI>Rumney,</HI> &amp; that for Medicine more than for drink; but now many kinds of Sacks are known and u&s;ed. And &s;o much for Wines.</P>

<P>The Licence for this foundation was granted by King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, the eleventh of his Reign, and in the twelfth of the &s;ame Kings reign, the Mayor and the Communalty of <HI>London,</HI> granted to <HI>Richard VVhittington,</HI> a vacant piece of ground thereon, to build his Colledge in the <HI>Royall;</HI> all which was confirmed by <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth the third of his Reign, to <HI>John Coventry, Jenkin Carpenter,</HI> and <HI>VVilliam Grove,</HI> Executors to to <HI>Richard Whittington.</HI></P>
<P>This foundation was again confirmed by Parliament, the tenth of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, and was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the Statute of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth. The Alms-Hou&s;es, with the poor men, do remain, and are paid by the Mercers.</P>
<P>This <HI>Richard VVhittington</HI> was (in this Church) three times buried, fir&s;t, by his Executors, under a fair Monument; then, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth, the Par&s;on of that Church, thinking &s;ome great riches (as he &s;aid) to be buried with him, cau&s;ed his Monument to be broken, his Body to be &s;poiled of his Leaden &s;heet, and again the &s;econd time to be buried; And in the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> the Pari&s;hioners were forced to take him up, and lap him in Lead, as afore, to bury him the third time, and to place his Monuments, or the like, over him again, which remaineth &s;till and &s;o he re&s;ted.</P>

<P>At the upper end of <HI>Ho&s;ier-lane,</HI> toward <HI>VVe&s;t-Cheape,</HI> is the fair Pari&s;h Church of St. <HI>Mary Bow;</HI> this Church in the Reign of <HI>VVilliam the Conqueror,</HI> being the fir&s;t in this City, builded on <HI>Arches of Stone,</HI> was therefore called <HI>New Mary Church,</HI> of <HI>St. Mary de Areubus, or le Bow,</HI> in <HI>VVest Cheaping;</HI> As <HI>Stratford Bridge,</HI> being the fir&s;t builded (by <HI>Matilda,</HI> the Queen, VVife to <HI>Henry</HI> the fir&s;t) with <HI>Arches</HI> of Stone was called <HI>Stratford le Bow;</HI> which names, to the &s;aid Church and Bridge, remain till this day; the Court of the Arches is kept in this Church, and taketh name of the place, not the place of the Court; but of what Antiquity, or continuation that Court hath there continued, 'tis uncertain.</P>
<P>This Church is of <HI>Cordwainer-&s;treet,</HI> and for divers accidents happening there, hath bin made more famous than any other Pari&s;h Church of the whole City, or Suburbs.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t we read, that in the year 1090, and the third of <HI>VVilliam Rufus,</HI> by tempe&s;t of vvind, the roof of the Church of St. <HI>Mary Bow</HI> in <HI>Cheape,</HI> was over|turned, wherewith &s;ome per&s;ons were flain, and four of the Rafters of &s;ix and twenty foot in length, with &s;uch violence were pitched in the ground of the high &s;treet, that &s;cantly four foot of them remained above ground, which were fain to be cut even with the ground, becau&s;e they could not be plucked out; for the City of <HI>London</HI> was not then paved, but a Moori&s;h ground.</P>
<P>In the year 1196. <HI>VVilliam Fitz Osbert,</HI> a &s;editious Traytor, took the <HI>Steeple of Bow,</HI> and fortified it with Munitions and victuals, but it was a&s;&s;aulted, and <HI>VVilliam</HI> with his Complices, were taken (though without blood-&s;hed) for he was forced by fire and &s;moak to for&s;ake the Church, and then being by the Judges condemned, he was by the heels drawn to the <HI>Elmes in Smithfield,</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="62">
and there hanged with nine of his fellowes, where becau&s;e his favourers came not to deliver him, he for&s;ook <HI>Maries</HI> Son, (as he termed Chri&s;t our Saviour) and called upon the Devil to help and deliver him: &s;uch was the end of this de|ceiver, a man of an evil life, a &s;ecret murtherer, a filthy fornicator, a keeper of Concubines, and (among&s;t other his dete&s;table facts) a fal&s;e accu&s;er of his elder Brother, who had (in his youth) brought him up in learning, and done many things for his preferment.</P>
<P>In the year 1271. a great part of the Church of <HI>Bow</HI> fell down, and &s;lew ma|ny people, men and women.</P>
<P>In the year 1284, the thirteenth of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, <HI>Lawrence Ducket,</HI> Gold|&s;mith, having grievou&s;ly wounded one <HI>Ralph Crepin</HI> in <HI>We&s;t Cheap,</HI> fled into <HI>Bow-Church,</HI> into the which (in the night time) entred certain evil per&s;ons, friends unto the &s;aid <HI>Ralph,</HI> and &s;lew the &s;aid <HI>Laurence,</HI> lying in the Steeple, and then hanged him up, placing him &s;o by the Window, as if he had hanged him|&s;elf, and &s;o was it found by Inqui&s;ition; for the which fact, <HI>Lawrence Ducket</HI> being drawn by the feet, was buried in a ditch without the City; but &s;hortly after (by relation of a Boy, who lay with the &s;aid <HI>Lawrence,</HI> at the time of his death, and had hid him there for fear) the truth of the matter was di&s;clo&s;ed; for the which cau&s;e, <HI>Jordan Good-Cheape, Ralph Crepin, Gilbert Clarke,</HI> and <HI>Jof|frey Clarke,</HI> were attainted, and a certain Woman named <HI>Alice,</HI> that was chief cau&s;er of the &s;aid mi&s;chief, was burned, and to the number of &s;ixteen men, were drawn and hanged, be&s;ides others that, being richer, after long impri&s;onment, were hanged by the pur&s;e.</P>
<P>The Church was interdicted, the Doors and Windows were &s;topped up with Thorns for a while, but <HI>Lawrence</HI> was taken up, and hone&s;tly buried in the Church-yard afterwards.</P>
<P>The Pari&s;h-Church of St. <HI>Mary Bow,</HI> by meanes of incroachment, and buil|ding of Hou&s;es, wanting room in their Church-yard, for burial of the Dead, <HI>John Rotham,</HI> or <HI>Rodham,</HI> Citizen and Taylor, by his Te&s;tament dated the year 1465. gave to the Par&s;on and Church-wardens, a certain Garden in <HI>Ho&s;ier-lane,</HI> to be a Church-yard, which &s;o continued near a hundred years, but now is buil|ded on, and is a private mans hou&s;e. The old Steeple of this Church, was by little and little re-edified, and new builded up, at the lea&s;t &s;o much as was fal|len down, many men giving &s;ums of money to the furtherance thereof, &s;o that at length, to wit, in the year 1469, it was ordained by a Common Councel, that the <HI>Bow Bell</HI> &s;hould be nightly rung at nine of the Clock.</P>
<P>Shortly after, <HI>John Donne</HI> Mercer, by his Te&s;tament dated 1472, according to the tru&s;t of Reginald <HI>Longdon,</HI> gave to the Par&s;on and Church-wardens of St. <HI>Mary Bow</HI> two Tenements, with the appurtenances, &s;ince made into one, in <HI>Ho&s;ierlane,</HI> then &s;o called, to the maintenance of <HI>Bow Bell,</HI> the &s;ame to be rung as afore&s;aid, and other things to be ob&s;erved, as by the Will ap|peareth.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arches</HI> or <HI>Bowes</HI> thereupon with the Lanthorns five in number, to wit, one at each Corner, and one on the top in the middle upon the Arches, were al&s;o afterward fini&s;hed of Stone, brought from <HI>Cane</HI> in <HI>Normandy,</HI> delivered at the Cu&s;tomers Key, for four &s;hillings eight pence the Tun 1515, and 1516, <HI>William Copland</HI> being Church-warden. It is &s;aid that this <HI>Copland</HI> gave the great Bell, which made the fifth in the Ring, to be rung nightly at nine of the Clock: This Bell was fir&s;t rung (as a Knell) at the Burial of the &s;ame <HI>Copland;</HI> It appeareth, that the Lanthorns on the top of this Steeple, were meant to have bin glazed, and lights in them placed nightly in the Winter, whereby Travel|lers to the City might have the better &s;ight thereof, and not to mi&s;&s;e of their wayes.</P>

In this Pari&s;h al&s;o was a Grammar-School, by commandment of King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, which <HI>School</HI> was (of old time) kept in an hou&s;e for that purpo&s;e pre|pared in the Church-yard; But that School being decayed, as others about this City, the School-hou&s;e was let out for Rent, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>8th,</HI> for four &s;hillings the year, a Cellar for two &s;hillings the year, and two Vaults under the Church, for 15 <HI>s.</HI> both.</P>
<P>There are Monuments of divers Citizens of note in this Church, but mo&s;t of them much defac'd, and mouldred away.</P>
<P>Without the North &s;ide of this Church of St. <HI>Mary Bow,</HI> towards <HI>We&s;t-Cheape,</HI> &s;tandeth one fair building of Stone, called in Record <HI>Sildam,</HI> a &s;hed which greatly darkneth the &s;aid Church; for by meanes thereof, all the Win|dows and doors on that &s;ide, are &s;topped up; King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, upon occa&s;ion, as &s;hall be &s;hewed in the Ward of <HI>Cheap,</HI> cau&s;ed this &s;ide or &s;hed to be made, and &s;trongly to be builded of Stone for him&s;elf, the Queen, and other States, to &s;tand there to behold the Ju&s;tings, and other &s;hewes at their plea|&s;ures; And this Hou&s;e (for long time after) &s;erved to that u&s;e, namely, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd; but in the year 1410. <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, in the twelfth of his Reign, confirmed the &s;aid &s;hed or building, to <HI>Stephen Spilman, William Marchford,</HI> and <HI>John Wattle,</HI> Mercers, by the name of one new <HI>Sildain,</HI> Shed or Building, with Shops, Cellars, and Edifices, what|&s;oever appertaining, called <HI>Croun&s;ild,</HI> or <HI>Tamer&s;ild,</HI> &s;cituate in the Mercery of <HI>We&s;t-Cheape,</HI> and in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Mary de Arcubus</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding which grant, the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> and other great E&s;tates, as well of forraign Countries repairing to this Realm, as Inhabitants of the &s;ame, have u&s;ually repaired to this place, therein to behold the &s;hewes of this City, pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>We&s;t-Cheape;</HI> namely, the great Watches accu&s;tomed in the night, on the Even of St. <HI>John Bapti&s;t,</HI> and St. <HI>Peter</HI> at Mid&s;ommer; the Examples whereof were over-long to recite, wherefore let it &s;uffice briefly to touch one.</P>
<P>In the year 1510, on St. <HI>Johns</HI> Eve at night, King <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, came to this place, then called the <HI>Kings-Head</HI> in <HI>Cheape,</HI> in the Livery of a Yeoman of the Gard, with an Halberd on his &s;houlder, and there beholding the Watch, departed privily, when the Watch was done; and was not known to any, but whom it plea&s;ed him; But on Saint <HI>Peters</HI> night next following, He and the Queen came Royally riding to the &s;aid place, and there with their Nobles, beheld the Watch of the City, and return'd in the morning.</P>

<P>Now for Antiquities, and things worthy of memory in <HI>Cheap-</HI>Ward.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, in the main Body of this Ward, that is, the <HI>Poultry,</HI> &s;tandeth the han&s;ome little Church, that beareth the name of St. <HI>Mildred in the Poultry the Virgin,</HI> which name was given &s;urely for di&s;tinction not for &s;uper&s;tition; for &s;o was the Cu&s;tom of the Kingdom (&amp; yet is) in building their things for the &s;ervice of God, thatthe Founders called them by the name of &s;ome Apo&s;tle, Saint, Martyr, or Confe&s;&s;or, as be&s;t liked their own conceit, at the pre&s;ent time, to di|&s;tingui&s;h them from others.</P>

<P>In what years this Church was fir&s;t erected, or who was the fir&s;t Founder of it, we find not; but it appeareth by &s;ome ancient Evidences of the &s;aid Church, that from the beginning it had not &s;o much &s;pare ground about it, as to make a Church-yard of, until in the year of our Lord God 1420, and the <HI>8th</HI> of King <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, <HI>Thomas Mor&s;ted</HI> E&s;quire, and Chirurgion to the Kings, <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, <HI>Henry</HI> the fifth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth.

In the Ea&s;t part of this &s;treet &s;tandeth the Great Conduit, of Sweet|water, conveyed by Pipes of Lead, under ground from <HI>Paddington,</HI> for &s;er|vice of this City, ca&s;tellated with &s;tone, and Ci&s;terned in Lead, about the year 1285, and again new builded and enlarged by <HI>Thomas Ilam</HI> one of the Sheriffs, 1479.</P>
<P>About the midde&s;t of this &s;treet is the <HI>Standard</HI> in <HI>Cheape:</HI> of what Anti|quity, the fir&s;t foundation is, I have not read. But <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth by his Patent, dated at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> the one and twentieth of his Reign (which Patent, was con|firmed by Parliament, 1442) granted Licence to <HI>Thomas Knolles, John Chichle,</HI> and other Executers to <HI>John Wells,</HI> Grocer, &s;ometime Maior of <HI>London,</HI> with his Goods to make new the high-way, which leadeth from the City of <HI>London,</HI> to|wards the place of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> before and nigh the Mannor of <HI>Savoy,</HI> parcel of the Dutchey of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> a way then very ruinous, and the Pavement broken, to the hurt and mi&s;chief of the Subjects, which old Pavement, then remaining in that way, within the length of five hundred foot, and all the breadth of the &s;ame, before and nigh the &s;ite of the Manner afore&s;aid, they were to break up, and with Stone, Gravel, and other &s;tuffe, make one other good and &s;ufficient way for the Commodity of the Subjects; And further, that the <HI>Standard</HI> in <HI>Cheape,</HI> where divers Executions of the Law before time had bin performed; which Standard at that pre&s;ent was very ruinous with age; in which there was a Conduit, &s;hould be taken down, and another competent Standard of Stone; to|gether with a Conduit in the &s;ame, of new, &s;trongly to be builded, for the Commodity and honour of the City, with the goods of their Te&s;tator, without interruption, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Of Executions at the Standard in <HI>Cheape,</HI> we read, that in the year 1293. three men had their right hands &s;mitten off there, for re&s;cuing of a Pri&s;oner, ar|re&s;ted by an Officer of the City.</P>
<P>In the year 1326, the Burge&s;&s;es of <HI>London,</HI> cau&s;ed <HI>Walter Stapleton,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Exceter,</HI> Trea&s;urer to <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, and others, to be beheaded at the Standard in <HI>Cheap</HI> (but this was by <HI>Pauls</HI> Gate.)</P>
<P>In the year 1351, the &s;ix and twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, two Fi&s;hmon|gers were beheaded at the Standard in <HI>Cheape. 1381, Wat Tylar</HI> beheaded, <HI>Rich|ard Lyons,</HI> and others, there.</P>
<P>In the year 1399, <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, cau&s;ed the Blank Charters, made by <HI>Rich|ard</HI> the &s;econd, to be burnt there.</P>
<P>In the year 1450, <HI>Jack Cade,</HI> Captain of the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Rebels, beheaded the Lord <HI>Say</HI> there.</P>
<P>In the year 1461, <HI>John Davy</HI> had his hand &s;tricken off there, becau&s;e he had &s;tricken a man before the Judges at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Then next is the great Cro&s;&s;e in <HI>VVe&s;t Cheap,</HI> which Cro&s;&s;e was there erected in the year 1290, by <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t; upon occa&s;ion thus, Queen <HI>Elianor</HI> his Wife, dyed at <HI>Hardeby</HI> (a Town near unto the City of <HI>Lincoln)</HI> her Body was brought from thence to <HI>VVe&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and the King in memory of her, cau&s;ed in every place, where her Body re&s;ted by the way, a &s;tately Cro&s;&s;e of Stone to be e|rected, with the Queens Image, and Arms upon it, as at <HI>Grantham, VVoborn, Northampton, Stony-stratford Dunstable,</HI> St. <HI>Albones, VValtham, VVe&s;t-Cheape,</HI> and at <HI>Charing,</HI> from whence &s;he was conveyed to <HI>VVestminster,</HI> and there bu|ried.</P>
<P>This Cro&s;&s;e in <HI>VVe&s;t-Cheape,</HI> being like to tho&s;e other which remain to this day; and being by length of time decayed, <HI>John Hatherley,</HI> Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> procured in the year 1441, Licence of King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, to re-edifie the &s;ame in more beautiful manner, for the honour of the City; and had Licence al&s;o to take up two hundred Fodder of Lead, for the building thereof, &amp; of cer|tain Conduits, and a common Granary. This Cro&s;&s;e was then curiou&s;ly wrought, at the Charges of divers Citizens: <HI>John Fi&s;her</HI> Mercer, gave &s;ix hun|dred
<PB N="115" REF="65">
Marks towards it, the &s;ame was begun to be &s;et up 1484, and fini&s;hed 1486, the &s;econd of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh: It was, after, gilt over, in the year 1522, again&s;t the comming in of <HI>Charles</HI> the fifth, Emperor. In the year 1553, again&s;t the Coronation of Queen <HI>Anne.</HI> New burni&s;hed again&s;t the Coronation of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth; And again new guilt 1554, again&s;t the comming in of King <HI>Philip.</HI> Since which time, the &s;aid Cro&s;&s;e having bin pre|&s;ented by divers Juries, (or Que&s;ts of <HI>Wardmote)</HI> to &s;tand in the high-way, to the let of carriages (as they alledged) but could not have it removed; it fol|lowed, that in the year 1581, the twenty one of <HI>June,</HI> in the night, the lowe&s;t Images round about the &s;aid Cro&s;&s;e (being of Chri&s;t his Re&s;urrection, of the <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> King <HI>Edward</HI> the Confe&s;&s;or, and &s;uch like) were broken, and de|faced: Proclamation was made, that who &s;o would di&s;cover the doers, &s;hould have forty Crowns, but nothing came to light: the Image of the ble&s;&s;ed Vir|gin, at that time was robbed of her Son, and her Arms broken, by which &s;he &s;tayed him on her knees; her whole body was al&s;o haled with Ropes, and le&s;t likely to fall; but in the year 1595. was again fa&s;tened and repaired; and in the year next following, a new mi&s;-&s;hapen Son, as born out of time, all naked, was laid in her Arms; the other Images remaining, broke as afore. But on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the &s;ame Cro&s;&s;e, the &s;teps being taken thence; under the Image of Chri&s;ts Re&s;urrection defaced, was &s;et up a curious wrought Tabernacle of gray Marble, and in the &s;ame an Alaba&s;ter Image of <HI>Diana,</HI> and water conveyed from the Thames, prilling from her naked Bre&s;t for a time, but now de|cayed.</P>
<P>In the year 1599, the Timber of the Cro&s;&s;e at the top, being rotted within the Lead, the Arms thereof bending, were feared to have fallen, to the harming of &s;ome people; and therefore the whole Body of the Cro&s;&s;e, was &s;caffolded about, and the top thereof taken down, meaning in place thereof, to have &s;et up a <HI>Pyramis:</HI> but &s;ome of her Maje&s;ties honourable Councellors, directed their Letters to Sir <HI>Nicholas Mo&s;ley,</HI> then Maior, by her Highne&s;&s;e expre&s;s Com|mandment concerning the Cro&s;&s;e, forthwith to be repaired, and placed again as it formerly &s;tood, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding, the &s;aid Cro&s;&s;e &s;tood headle&s;s more then a year after, whereupon the &s;aid Councellors in great number, meaning not any longer to permit the continuance of &s;uch a contempt, wrote to <HI>Wil|liam Rider,</HI> then Maior, requiring him, by vertue of her Highne&s;s &s;aid former direction and Commandement, without any further delay, to accompli&s;h her Maje&s;ties mo&s;t princely care therein, re&s;pecting e&s;pecially, the Antiquity and continuance of that Monument, and ancient En&s;ign of Chri&s;tianity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> dated the four and twentieth of <HI>December,</HI> 1600. After this, a Cro&s;&s;e of Timber was framed, &s;et up, covered with Lead, and gilded, the Body of the Cro&s;&s;e down|ward, clean&s;ed of du&s;t, the Scaffold carryed thence. About twelve nights fol|lowing, the Image of our Lady was again defaced, by plucking off her Crown, and almo&s;t her head, taking from her, her naked Child, and &s;tabbing her in the Bre&s;t.</P>
<P>But in the year 1644, during the Reign of the long Parliament, the &s;aid Cro&s;&s;e, by an Ordinance thereof, was utterly demoli&s;hed; and while the thing was doing, there was a noy&s;e of Trumpets blew all the while. Upon the utter demolition of this &s;o ancient and vi&s;ible a Monument, or Ornament of the City of <HI>London</HI> as all Forrainers e&s;teemed it, it fortuned, that there was another new one, popp'd up in <HI>Cheap-&s;ide,</HI> hard by the Standard, <HI>viz.</HI> a high &s;quare Ta|ble of Stone, left in Legacy by one <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> a Porter, and well-minded man, with this Di&s;tichengraven,</P>
<LG>
<L>God ble&s;&s;e the Porter who great pains doth take,</L>
<L>Re&s;t here, and welcome when thy back doth ake.</L>

<P>Thus much for the <HI>Cro&s;&s;e</HI> in <HI>We&s;t-cheape.</HI> Then at the We&s;t end of <HI>West-</HI>Cheap-&s;treet,
<PB N="116" REF="66">
was &s;ometimes a Cro&s;&s;e of Stone called the <HI>Old Cro&s;&s;e. Ralph Higden</HI> in his <HI>Polychronicon</HI> &s;aith, that <HI>Walter Stapleton</HI> Bi&s;hop of Exceter, Trea|&s;urer to <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd, was by the Burge&s;les of <HI>London</HI> beheaded at this Cro&s;&s;e, then called the Standard, without the North door of St. <HI>Pauls</HI> Church; and &s;o it is noted in other Writers that then lived. This old Cro&s;&s;e &s;tood and remained at the Ea&s;t end of the Pari&s;h Church called St. <HI>Michael</HI> in the corner by <HI>Pauls</HI> Gate, near to the North end of the old Exchange, till the year 1390, the thirteenth of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, in place of which old Cro&s;&s;e then taken down, the &s;aid Church of St. <HI>Michael</HI> was enlarged, and al&s;o a fair Water-Con|duit builded, about the ninth of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth.</P>
<P>In the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, divers Ju&s;tings were made in this &s;treet, betwixt <HI>Sopers</HI> Lane and the great Cro&s;&s;e, namely, one in the year 1331, about the one and twentieth of <HI>September,</HI> as 'tis ob&s;erved by divers Writers of that time. In the middle of the City of <HI>London,</HI> (&s;ay they) in a Street called <HI>Cheap,</HI> the Stone pavement, being covered with &s;and, that the Hor&s;es might not &s;lide, when they &s;trongly &s;et their feet to the ground, the King held a Tournement three daies together with the Nobility, valiant men of the Realm, and others, &s;ome &s;trange Knights; And to the end the beholders might with the better ea&s;e &s;ee the &s;ame, there was a wooden Scaffold erected cro&s;&s;e the &s;treet, like unto a Tower, wherein Queen <HI>Philip</HI> and many other Ladies, richly attired, and a&s;&s;embled from all parts of the Realm, did &s;tand to behold the Ju&s;ts, but the higher frame in which the Ladies were placed, brake in &s;under, whereby they were (with &s;ome &s;hame) forced to fall down, by rea&s;on whereof the Knights, and &s;uch as were underneath, were grievou&s;ly hurt; wherefore the Queen took great care to &s;ave the Carpenters from puni&s;hment, and through her prayers (which &s;he made upon her Knees) pacified the King and Councel, and thereby purcha&s;ed great love of the people. After which time, the King cau&s;ed a &s;hed to be &s;trongly made of Stone for him&s;elf, the Queen, and other States to &s;tand on, and there to behold the Ju&s;tings, and other &s;hewes, at their plea&s;ure, by the Church of St. <HI>Mary Bow,</HI> as is &s;hewed in <HI>Cordwayner-&s;treet</HI> Ward. Thus much for the High &s;treet of <HI>Cheap.</HI></P>
<P>Now of the North &s;ide of Cheap &s;treet and Ward, beginning at the great Conduit, and by St. <HI>Mary Cole Church,</HI> where we left; Next thereunto We&s;t-ward, is the <HI>Mercers Chappel,</HI> &s;ometime an Ho&s;pital, entituled of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> of <HI>Acon,</HI> or <HI>Acars,</HI> for a Ma&s;ter and Brethren. <HI>Militia Ho&s;pitalis &amp;c,</HI> &s;aith the Re|cord of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, the fourteenth year, it was founded by <HI>Thomas Fitz Theohald de Heili,</HI> and <HI>Agnes</HI> his Wife, &s;i&s;ter to <HI>Thomas Becket,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd: they gave to the Ma&s;ter and Brethren the Lands with the ap|purtenances, that &s;ometimes were <HI>Gilbert Beckets,</HI> Father to the &s;aid <HI>Thomas,</HI> in the which he was born, there to make a Church; There was a Charnel, and a Chappel over it of St. <HI>Nicholas</HI> and St. <HI>Stephen;</HI> This Ho&s;pital was valued to di&s;pend two hundred &s;eventy &s;even pounds, three &s;hillings four pence, &s;urrendred the thirtieth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, the one and twentieth of <HI>October,</HI> and was &s;ince purcha&s;ed by the <HI>Mercers,</HI> by means of Sir <HI>Richard Gre&s;ham,</HI> and was again &s;et open on the Eve of Saint <HI>Michael</HI> 1541, the three and thirtieth of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth; It is now called the <HI>Mercers Chappel,</HI> therein is kept a free Grammar School, as of old time had been accu&s;tomed, commanded by Parliament.</P>
<P>In this Chappel there is every Sunday morning throughout the year a Sermon in the <HI>Italian</HI> Tongue, beginning about ten a clock.</P>
<P>Here be many Monuments remaining, but more have been defaced; among others, there is <HI>James Butler</HI> Earl of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and Dame <HI>Joane</HI> his Counte&s;&s;e, 1428.</P>
<P>Before this Ho&s;pital towards the &s;treet, was builded a fair and beautiful Chap|pel arched over with &s;tone, and thereupon the Mercers Hall, a mo&s;t curious

pieceor work, Sir <HI>John Allen</HI> Mercer, being &s;ounder of that Chappel, was there buried, but &s;ince his Tombe is removed thence into the Body of the Ho&s;pitall Church, and his Body-room divided into Shops, are letten out for Rent; The&s;e Mercers were enabled to be a Company, and to purcha&s;e Lands to the value of twenty pound the year, the &s;eventeenth of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd; they had three Me&s;&s;uages and Shops in the Pari&s;h of Saint <HI>Martins Ote&s;wich,</HI> in the Ward of <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate,</HI> for the &s;u&s;tentation of the poor, and a Chantry, the two and twen|tieth of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd. <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth in the twelfth of his Reign, con|firmed to <HI>Stephen Spilman, W.

<P>Next beyond the <HI>Mercers Chappel,</HI> and their Hall, is <HI>Ironmonger</HI> Lane, &s;o cal|led of <HI>Ironmongers</HI> dwelling there.</P>
<P>In this Lane, is the &s;mall Pari&s;h Church of St. <HI>Martin,</HI> called <HI>Pomary,</HI> upon what occa&s;ion I certainly know not; it is &s;uppo&s;ed to be of <HI>Apples</HI> growing, where now Hou&s;es are lately builded.</P>
<P>Farther We&s;t, is St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> Lane, &s;o called of St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> Church, which &s;tandeth directly over again&s;t the North end thereof. Antiquities in this Lane I finde none other, then that among many fair Hou&s;es, there is one large Inne for receipt of travellers, called <HI>Blo&s;&s;omes Inne,</HI> but corruptly <HI>Bo&s;omos Inne,</HI> and hath to Sign St. <HI>Lawrence</HI> the Deacon, in a Border of <HI>Blo&s;&s;oms</HI> or Flowers.</P>
<P>Then near to the &s;tandard in Cheap, is <HI>Hony-lane,</HI> being very narrow, and &s;omewhat dark.</P>
<P>In this Lane, is the &s;mall Pari&s;h Church called <HI>Alhallowes in Hony-Lane;</HI> There be no Monuments in this Church worth the noting. I find that <HI>John Norman,</HI> Draper, Mayor 1453, was buried there. He gave to the Drapers his Tenements on the North &s;ide the &s;aid Church; they to allow for the Beam light and Lamp, thirteen &s;hillings four pence yearly, from this Lane to the Standard. And thus much for Cheap Ward, in the High-&s;treet of Cheap, for it &s;tretcheth no farther.</P>
<P>Now, for the North wing of <HI>Cheap</HI> Ward, have ye <HI>Catte-street,</HI> corruptly called <HI>Catteaten-</HI>&s;treet, which beginneth at the North end of <HI>Ironmonger</HI> Lane, and runneth to the We&s;t end of Saint <HI>Lawrence-Church,</HI> as is afore-&s;hewed.</P>
<P>On the North &s;ide of this &s;treet is the <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> wherein the Courts for the City are kept, namely, fir&s;t the Court of <HI>Common-Councel,</HI> &s;econd the Court of the Lord <HI>Mayor</HI> and his Brethren the Aldermen, third the Court of <HI>Hu&s;tings,</HI> fourth the Court of <HI>Orphanes,</HI> fifth the two <HI>Courts of the Sheriffs,</HI> &s;ixt the Court of the <HI>Wardmote,</HI> &s;eventh the Court of <HI>Hallmote,</HI> eight the Court of <HI>Reque&s;ts,</HI> com|monly called <HI>the Court of Con&s;cience,</HI> nine the <HI>Chamberlains Court</HI> for Prentices, &amp; making them free; This <HI>Guild-hall,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Robert F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="2 letters">ian,</HI> was began to be builded new in the year 1411, the twelfth of <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth by <HI>Thomas Knowles,</HI> then Mayor, and his Brethren the Aldermen; The &s;ame was made, of a little Cottage, a large and great Hou&s;e, as now it &s;tandeth, towards the charges where|of, the Companies gave large benevolences; Al&s;o offences of men were pardo|ned for &s;ums of money towards this work, extraordinary Fees were rai&s;ed, Fines, Amercements, and other things imployed, during &s;even years, with a Continu|ation thereof, three years more, all to be employed to this building.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, <HI>John Coventry</HI> &amp; <HI>John Carpenter</HI> Executors to <HI>Richard Whittington,</HI> gave towards the paving of this great Hall twenty pounds and the next year fifteen pounds more to the &s;aid pavement, with hard Stone of <HI>Purbeck;</HI> They al&s;o glaz'd &s;ome VVindows thereof, and of the Mayors Court,
<PB N="118" REF="67">
on every which Window, the Arms of <HI>Richard Whittington</HI> are placed. The foun|dation of the Mayors Court was laid in the third year of the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, and of the Porch on the South &s;ide of the Mayors Court, in the fourth of the &s;aid King. Then was builded the Mayors Chamber, and the Councel Chamber, with other Roomes above the &s;taires.</P>
<P>Having here &s;o ju&s;t occa&s;ion, &s;peaking of that former ancient Councel Cham|ber, which hath continued &s;o ever &s;ince, I cannot but account it expedient (as in no place better fitting) to remember the fair and goodly new Councel Cham|ber, a worthy Act, and an Honour to the City. The &s;aid new Councel Cham|ber, with a fair Room over the &s;ame, appointed for a Trea&s;ury, wherein to pre|&s;erve the Books and Records belonging to the City, and another Room al&s;o un|derneath the &s;ame Chamber, re&s;erved for nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e and employment, began to be builded the fir&s;t week after Ea&s;ter, in the time of the Majoralty of Sir <HI>Tho|mas Middleton.</HI> Knight, and Alderman, in the year of our Lord 1614, it was fully fini&s;hed &s;hortly after <HI>Michaelmas</HI> 1615, at the latter end of the Majoralty of Sir <HI>Thomas Hayes,</HI> Knight and Alderman; But the Lord Mayor, and the Al|dermen his Brethren, kept their fir&s;t Court in the &s;aid new Councel Chamber, on the &s;eventh day of <HI>November,</HI> in the year of our Lord 1615, Sir <HI>John Jolles</HI> Knight and Alderman, being then Lord Mayor; by who&s;e order and direction, the &s;aid building was performed, from the fir&s;t beginning thereof, to the finall fini&s;hing of the &s;ame, amounting to the charge of 1740 <HI>l.</HI> than which, no mo|ney could be better be&s;towed, nor more to the Cities credit and renown.</P>
<P>La&s;t of all, a &s;tately Porch entring the great Hall, was erected; the front there|of towards the Stouth, being beautified with Images of Srone.</P>
<P>Now for the Chappel or Colledge of our Lady <HI>Mary Magdalene,</HI> and of <HI>All Saints</HI> by <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> called <HI>London Colledge,</HI> we read, that the &s;ame was buil|ded about the year 1299, and that <HI>Peter Fanelore, Adam Francis,</HI> and <HI>Henry Frowick</HI> Citizen, gave one Me&s;&s;uage with the appurtenances, in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Fo&s;ter,</HI> to <HI>William Brampton</HI> Cu&s;tos of the Chauntry, by them founded in the &s;aid Chappel, with four Chaplains; and one other Hou&s;e in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Giles</HI> without <HI>Creplegate,</HI> in the &s;even and twentieth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, was given to them.</P>
<P>Adjoyning to this Chappel on the South &s;ide, was &s;ometime a fair and large Library, furni&s;hed with Books pertaining to the <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> and Colledge.</P>
<P>The&s;e Books (as it is &s;aid) were in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth, &s;ent for by <HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> Lord Protector, with promi&s;e to be re&s;tored &s;hort|ly; Men laded from thence three&s;core Carts with them, but they were never returned; This Library was builded by the Executors of <HI>R. Whittington,</HI> and by <HI>W. Bury;</HI> on the other &s;ide, it is now lofted through, and made a Store-hou&s;e for Cloaths,</P>
<P>South-we&s;t from this <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> is the fair Pari&s;h Church of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> called, in the <HI>Jury,</HI> becau&s;e (of old time) many Jewes inhabited there about; This Church is fair and large, and hath divers Monuments.</P>
<P>In this Church there was the Shank-bone of a man, and al&s;o a Tooth of a ve|ry great bigne&s;s, hanged up for &s;hew, in Chains of Iron, upon a Pillar of Stone: the Tooth (being about the bigne&s;s of a mans fi&s;t) is long &s;ince conveyed from thence; the Thigh or Shank-bone, of five and twenty inches in length by the Rule, remaineth yet fa&s;tned to a po&s;t of Timber, and is not &s;o much to be noted for the length, as for the thickne&s;s, hardne&s;s, and &s;trength thereof; for when it was hanged on the Stone Pillar, it fretted (with moving) the &s;aid Pillar, and was not it &s;elf fretted, nor (as &s;eemeth) is not yet lightned by remaining dry: but where or when this Bone was fir&s;t found or di&s;covered, I have not heard.</P>

<P>Antiquities therein to be noted, are the&s;e, Fir&s;t, the &s;treet of <HI>Lothbury, Lathbery,</HI> or <HI>Loadbay;</HI> This &s;treet is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed (for the mo&s;t part) by Founders, that ca&s;t Candle&s;ticks, Chafing-di&s;hes, Spice-Mortars, and &s;uch like Copper or Latin workes, and do after turn them with the Foot, and not with the Wheel, to make them &s;moth and bright, with turning and &s;crating, (as &s;ome do term it) making a loath&s;ome noi&s;e to the by-pa&s;&s;ers, that have not been u&s;ed to the like, and therefore by them di&s;dainedly called <HI>Lothbury.</HI> On the South &s;ide of this &s;treet among&s;t the Founders be &s;ome fair Hou&s;es and large, for Merchants; namely, one that of old time was the Jews <HI>Synagogue,</HI> which was defaced by the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> after that they had &s;lain &s;even hundred Jewes, and &s;poi|led the re&s;idue of their goods, in the year 1262, the forty &s;eventh of <HI>Henry</HI> the third. And not long after, in the year 1291, King <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t bani&s;hed the remnant of the Jewes out of <HI>England,</HI> as is afore &s;hewed.</P>
<P>The Synagogue being &s;o &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, certain Fryars got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof; For in the year 1257, (&s;aith <HI>Matthew Paris)</HI> there were &s;een in <HI>London</HI> a new Order of Fryars, called <HI>De poenitentia Je&s;u,</HI> or <HI>Fratres de &s;acco,</HI> becau&s;e they were apparrelled in &s;ackcloth, who had their Hou&s;e in <HI>London,</HI> near unto <HI>Alder&s;gate,</HI> without the gate, and had Licence of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in the four and twentieth of his Reign, to remove from thence to any other place; and in the fifty &s;ixt, &s;he gave unto them this <HI>Jews Synagogue.</HI> After which time <HI>Elianor</HI> the Queen, wife to <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, took into her protection, and warranted unto the Prior and Brethren <HI>De poenitentia Je&s;u Chri&s;ti,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> the &s;aid Land and building in <HI>Cole-Church</HI> &s;treet, in the Pari&s;h of Saint <HI>Olave</HI> in the Jury and St. <HI>Margaret</HI> in <HI>Loathbury,</HI> by her granted, with con&s;ent of <HI>Stephen de Fulborn,</HI> under-Warden of the Bridge-hou&s;e, and other Brethren of that Hou&s;e, for three&s;core Marks of Silver, which they had received of the &s;aid Prior and Brethren of repentance, towards the building of the &s;aid Bridge. This Order of Friers gathered many good Schollars, and multiplyed in number exceedingly, untill the Councel of <HI>Lyons;</HI> by the which it was Decreed, that (from that time forth) there &s;hould no more Orders of Begging Fryers, be permitted, but only the four Orders, to wit, the <HI>Dominick</HI> or Preachers, the <HI>Minorites</HI> or <HI>Gray Fryers,</HI> and the <HI>Augu&s;tines:</HI> and &s;o from that time the Begging Fryers decreated and fell to nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="68">
Now it followed, that in the year 1305, <HI>Robert Fitzwalter,</HI> reque&s;ted and obtained of the &s;aid King <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, that the &s;ame Fryers of the <HI>Sack,</HI> might a&s;&s;igne to the &s;aid <HI>Robert,</HI> their Chappel or Church, of old time, called the Synagogue of the <HI>Jewes,</HI> near adjoyning to the then Man&s;ion hou&s;e of the &s;ame <HI>Robert,</HI> which was in place where now &s;tandeth the <HI>Grocers</HI> Hall, and the &s;aid Synagogue was at the North Corner of the old Jury, <HI>Robert Large,</HI> Mercer, Mayor, in the year 1439, kept his Majoralty in this Hou&s;e, and dwelled there until his dying day.</P>
<P>This Hou&s;e &s;tandeth, and is of two Pari&s;hes, as opening into <HI>Lothbury,</HI> of St. <HI>Margarets</HI> Pari&s;h, and opening into the <HI>Old Jewry,</HI> of St. <HI>Olaves</HI> Pari&s;h, The &s;aid <HI>Robert Large,</HI> gave liberally to both the&s;e Pari&s;hes, but was buried at St. <HI>Olaves.</HI></P>
<P>Hugh <HI>Clopton,</HI> Mercer, Maior 1492, dwelled in this Hou&s;e, and kept his Ma|joralty there: it is now a Tavern, and hath to &s;igne a Wind-Mill.</P>
<P>And thus much for this Hou&s;e, &s;ometimes the <HI>Jews</HI> Synagogue, &s;ince an hou&s;e of Fryers, then a Noble mans Hou&s;e, after that, a Marchants Hou&s;e, wherein Majoralities have bin kept, and now a Wine-Tavern.</P>
<P>Then is the <HI>Old Jewry</HI> a &s;treet &s;o called of <HI>Jews,</HI> &s;ometime dwelling there, and near adjoyning in the Pari&s;hes of St. <HI>Olave,</HI> St. <HI>Michael Ba&s;ing Hall,</HI> St. <HI>Martin Ironmonger-lane,</HI> St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> called the <HI>Jewry,</HI> and &s;o We&s;t to <HI>Wood-&s;treet.

<P><HI>William Ru&s;us</HI> favoured them &s;o far, that he &s;ware by <HI>Lukes face,</HI> his com|mon Oath, if they could overcome the Chri&s;tians, he would be one of their Sect.</P>
<P><HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd, grievou&s;ly puni&s;hed them for corrupting his Coyne. <HI>Richard</HI> the fir&s;t forbad Jewes, and Women to be pre&s;ent at his Coronation, for fear of Inchantments; for breaking of which Commandment, many Jews were &s;lain, who being a&s;&s;embled, to pre&s;ent the King with &s;ome gift, one of them was &s;tricken by a Chri&s;tian, which &s;ome unruly people perceiving, fell upon them, beat them to their hou&s;es, and brent them therein, or &s;lew them at their comming out.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the Jewes at <HI>Norwich,</HI> St. <HI>Edmonds bury, Lincoln, Stanford,</HI> and <HI>Lyn,</HI> were robbed and &s;poyled; and at <HI>York,</HI> to the number of five hundred, be&s;ides Women and Children entred a Tower of the Ca&s;tle, profered money to be in &s;urety of their lives; but the Chri&s;tians would not take it; whereupon, they cut the throats of their own Wives and Children, and ca&s;t them over the Walls on the Chri&s;tians heads; and then, entring the Kings Lodging, they burned both the Hou&s;e and them&s;elves.</P>
<P>King <HI>John,</HI> in the <HI>11th</HI> of his Reign, commanded all the Jews, both Men and Women, to be impri&s;oned, and grievou&s;ly puni&s;hed, becau&s;e he would have all their Money; &s;ome of them gave all they had, and promi&s;ed more, to e&s;|cape &s;o many kinds of torments; for every one of them, had one of their eyes at the lea&s;t plucked out. Among&s;t whom there was one, which being tormen|ted many wayes, would not ran&s;ome him&s;elf, till the King had cau&s;ed (every day) one of his great teeth to be plucked out, by the &s;pace of &s;even dayes, and then he gave the King ten thou&s;and Marks of &s;ilver: to the end, they &s;hould pull out no more, the &s;aid King at that time, &s;poyl'd the Jews of &s;ixty &s;ix thou|&s;and Marks.</P>
<P>The <HI>17th</HI> of this King, the Barons brake into the Jews Hou&s;es, rifled their Coffers, and with the Stone of their Hou&s;es, repaired the Gates and Walls of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in the <HI>11th</HI> of his Reign, granted to <HI>Semaine,</HI> or <HI>Balla&s;ter,</HI> the hou&s;e of <HI>Benomie Mittun</HI> the Jew, in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Michael Ba&s;&s;ing-Langhe,</HI> in which the &s;aid <HI>Benemy</HI> dwelt, with the fourth part of all his

<P>In the like manner, and for like &s;ervices, the King granted to <HI>Gu&s;o</HI> for his Homage, the other part of the Lands of the &s;aid <HI>Benomye</HI> in St. <HI>Michaels</HI> Pari&s;h; which Law, the Painter held, and was the Kings Excheter, and the Lands of the &s;aid <HI>Benomye,</HI> in the &s;aid Pari&s;h, which <HI>VValter Turner</HI> held, and fifteen foot of Land, which <HI>Hugh Harman</HI> held, with fifteen Iron Ells of Land, and an half, in the front of Iron-monger-lane, in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Martin,</HI> which were the &s;aid <HI>Benomyes,</HI> of the Fee of the Ho&s;pital of St. <HI>Giles,</HI> and which <HI>Adam</HI> the Smith held, with two Stone-Hou&s;es, which were <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> the Jew of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Olave;</HI> and which a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the Fee of <HI>Arnold de Reus,</HI> and are the Kings Exchetes, as afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>The <HI>16th</HI> of the &s;aid <HI>Henry,</HI> the Jews in <HI>London,</HI> builded a Synagogue, but the King commanded, it &s;hould be dedicated to our ble&s;&s;ed Lady, and after gave it to the Brethren of St. <HI>Anthonies of Vienna,</HI> and &s;o was it called St. <HI>An|thonies Ho&s;pital.</HI></P>
<P>This King <HI>Henry</HI> founded a Church and Hou&s;e for converted Jews, in a new &s;treet by the Temple, whereby it came to pa&s;&s;e, that (in &s;hort time) there was gathered a great number of Converts.</P>
<P>The twentieth of this King <HI>Henry,</HI> &s;even Jews were brought from <HI>Norwich,</HI> vvhich had &s;tolen a chri&s;tened Child, had circumci&s;ed, and minded to have cru|cified him at <HI>Ea&s;ter,</HI> vvherefore their Bodies and Goods vvere at the Kings plea|&s;ure: The &s;ix and twentieth, the Jews vvere con&s;trained to pay to the King, twenty thou&s;and Marks, at two Termes in the year, or el&s;e to be kept in per|petual Pri&s;on.</P>

<P>In the &s;ortieth year, vvere brought up to <HI>VVestmin&s;ter,</HI> two hundred Jews from <HI>Lincoln,</HI> for crucifying a Child, named <HI>Hugh;</HI> eighteen of them were hang'd.</P>
<P>The forty third, a Jew at <HI>Tewksbury</HI> fell into a Privie on the Saturday, and would not that day be taken out, for reverence of his Sabbath; wherefore <HI>Richard Clare,</HI> Earl of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> kept him there till <HI>Monday,</HI> that he was dead.</P>
<P>The forty &s;even, the Barons &s;lew of the Jews at <HI>London,</HI> &s;even hundred; the re&s;t were &s;poiled, and their Synagogue defaced, becau&s;e one Jew would have forced a Chri&s;tian to have payd more than two &s;hillings, for the lone of twenty &s;hillings a week.</P>
<P>The third of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t, in a Parliament at <HI>London,</HI> u&s;ury was forbidden to the Jews; and that all U&s;urers might be known, the King commanded that every U&s;urer &s;hould weare a Table on his bre&s;t, the breadth of a Paveline, or el&s;e to avoid the Realm.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth of the &s;aid King <HI>Edward,</HI> a Reformation was made for clipping of the Kings Coyn; for which offence, two hundred &s;ixty &s;even Jews were drawn and hanged; three were Engli&s;h Chri&s;tians, and other were Engli&s;h Jews.</P>
<P>The &s;ame year the Jews crucified a child at <HI>Northampton;</HI> for the which fact, many Jews at <HI>London</HI> were drawn at Hor&s;es Tayls, and hanged.</P>

<P>The <HI>16th</HI> of the &s;aid <HI>Edward,</HI> all the Jews in <HI>England,</HI> were (in one day) ap|prehended by precept from the King but they redeemed them&s;elves for twelve thou&s;and pounds of &s;ilver; notwith&s;tanding, in the nineteenth of his Reign, he bani&s;hed them all out of <HI>England,</HI> giving them only to bear their Charge, till they were out of this Realm, the number of Jews then expul&s;ed, were fifteen thou&s;and and &s;ixty per&s;ons: the <HI>King</HI> made a mighty ma&s;&s;e of money of their Hou&s;es, which he &s;old, and yet the Commons of <HI>England</HI> had granted, and gave him a fifteenth of all their Goods, to bani&s;h them; and thus much for the Jewes.</P>

<PB N="124" REF="70">
and We&s;t; but contrariwi&s;e, the &s;ame was builded North and South, and in the form of a Noblemans Hou&s;e, and therefore the be&s;t Opinion (in my judgement) is, that it was (of old time) belonging to the Family of the <HI>Ba&s;&s;ings,</HI> which was in this Realm, a name of great Antiquity and Renown; and that it beares al|&s;o the name of that Family, and was called therefore <HI>Ba&s;sings-Haugh,</HI> or <HI>Hall.</HI></P>
<P>Now how <HI>Bakewell-hall</HI> took that name, is another Que&s;tion, For which I read, That <HI>Thomas Bakewel</HI> dwelled in this Hou&s;e, in the 36. of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>3d,</HI> and that in the 20. of <HI>Richard</HI> the <HI>2d,</HI> the &s;aid <HI>King</HI> for the &s;um of 50. pounds, which the Mayor and the Communalty, had paid into the <HI>Hanapar,</HI> granted Li|cence, &s;o much as was in him, to <HI>John Fro&s;h, William Parker,</HI> and <HI>Stephen Spil|man,</HI> (Citizens and Mercers) that they, the &s;aid Me&s;&s;uage, called <HI>Bakewell-hall,</HI> and one Garden, with the appurtenances, in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Michael</HI> of <HI>Ba&s;|&s;ings-Haugh,</HI> and of St. <HI>Lawrence,</HI> in the Jewry of <HI>London,</HI> and one Me&s;&s;uage, two Shops, and one Garden, in the &s;aid Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> which they held of the King in <HI>Burgage,</HI> might give and a&s;&s;ign to the Mayor and Communalty for ever.</P>
<P>This <HI>Bakewell-Hall</HI> thus e&s;tabli&s;hed, hath bin long &s;ince imployed, as a week|ly Market-place for all &s;orts of <HI>Woollen Clothes,</HI> broad and narrow, brought from all parts of this Realm, there to be &s;old.

<P>This Hou&s;e (of late years) growing ruinous, and in danger of falling, <HI>Rich|ard May,</HI> Merchant-Taylor, at his decea&s;e, gave towards the new building of the outward part thereof, <HI>300l.</HI> upon condition, that the &s;ame &s;hould be per|formed, within three years after his Decea&s;e; whereupon, the old <HI>Bakewell-Hall,</HI> was taken down, and in the Moneth of <HI>February</HI> next following, the foun|dation of a new, &s;trong, and beautiful Store-hou&s;e being laid, the work thereof was &s;o diligently applyed, that within the &s;pace of ten moneths after, to the charges of two thou&s;and five hundred pounds, the &s;ame was fini&s;hed, in the year 1588.</P>
<P>Next beyond this Hou&s;e, are placed divers fair Hou&s;es for Marchants, and o|thers, till ye come to the back Gate of <HI>Guild-hall;</HI> which Gate, and part of the building within the &s;ame, is of this Ward: &s;ome &s;mall di&s;tance beyond this Gate, the <HI>Coopers</HI> have their common Hall.</P>
<P>Then is the Pari&s;h Church of St. <HI>Michael,</HI> called St. <HI>Michael</HI> at <HI>Ba&s;sings-hall,</HI> a proper Church, lately re-edified or new builded.</P>

<HEAD>The Nineteenth Ward, or Aldermanry of the City of <HI>LONDON,</HI> called <HI>Cripple-gate</HI> Ward.</HEAD>
<P>THe Next Ward is called of <HI>Cripplegate,</HI> and con&s;i&s;teth of divers Streets and Lanes, lying as well without the Gate and Wall of the City, as within. Fir&s;t, within the Wall on the Ea&s;t part thereof, towards the North; it runneth to the We&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Ba&s;&s;ing Hall's Ward,</HI> and towards the South, it joyneth to the Ward of <HI>Cheap;</HI> It beginneth at the We&s;t end of the St. <HI>Laurence</HI> Church in the Jury, on the North-&s;ide, and run|eth We&s;t to a Pumpe, where &s;ometimes was a well with Buckets, at the South Corner of <HI>Alderman-Bury-Street,</HI> which Street runneth down North to <HI>Gay&s;pur</HI> Lane, and to London Wall, which Street and Lane are wholly (on both &s;ides) of this Ward, and &s;o be &s;ome few hou&s;es (on both &s;ides) from <HI>Gay&s;pur</HI> Lane, by and again&s;t the Wall of the City, Ea&s;t to the Grates, made for the water-cour&s;e of the Channels, and We&s;t to the <HI>Creple|gate.</HI></P>
<P>Now on the South &s;ide, from over again&s;t the We&s;t End of Saint <HI>Laurence</HI> Church, to the Pumpe, and up <HI>Milke-Street</HI> South unto <HI>Cheap,</HI> which <HI>Milke-Street</HI> is wholly (on both the &s;ides) of <HI>Cripplegate</HI> Ward, as al&s;o without the South end of <HI>Milke-Street,</HI> a part of We&s;t <HI>Cheap,</HI> to wit, from the Standard to the Cro&s;&s;e, is all of <HI>Cripplegate</HI> Ward. Then down great <HI>Wood-Street,</HI> which is wholly of this Ward on both the &s;ides thereof, &s;o is little <HI>Wood-Street,</HI> which runneth down to <HI>Creplegate.</HI></P>
<P>Out of this <HI>Wood-Street</HI> be diver Lanes, namely on the Ea&s;t &s;ide is <HI>Lad lane,</HI> which runneth Ea&s;t to <HI>Milke-Street</HI> Corner, down lower in <HI>WoodStreet</HI> is <HI>Love lane,</HI> which lieth by the South &s;ide of St. <HI>Albans</HI> Church in <HI>Wood-Street,</HI> and runneth down to the <HI>Conduit</HI> in <HI>Aldermanbury-Street;</HI> Lower down in <HI>Wood-Street,</HI> is <HI>Addle-Street,</HI> out of the which runneth <HI>Philip-lane,</HI> down to <HI>London</HI> Wall. The&s;e be the Lanes on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide.</P>
<P>On the We&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Wood-Street,</HI> in <HI>Huggon lane,</HI> by the South &s;ide of St. <HI>Michaels</HI> Church &amp; goeth thorow to <HI>Gutherons lane;</HI> Then lower is <HI>Maiden-lane,</HI> which runneth We&s;t to the North End of <HI>Gutherons lane,</HI> and up the &s;aid lane on the Ea&s;t &s;ide thereof, till again&s;t <HI>Kery lane,</HI> and back again, then the &s;aid <HI>Maiden-lane,</HI> on the North &s;ide, goeth up to <HI>Staining lane,</HI> &amp; up a part thereof on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, to the farthe&s;t North part of <HI>Haberda&s;hers Hall,</HI> and back again to <HI>Wood-Street,</HI> and there lower down is <HI>Silver Street,</HI> which is of this Ward, till ye come to the Ea&s;t End of St. <HI>Olaves</HI> Church on the South &s;ide, and to <HI>Monkes-well Street,</HI> on the North &s;ide, then down the &s;aid <HI>Monkes-well Street</HI> on the Ea&s;t &s;ide thereof, and &s;o to <HI>Cripplegate,</HI> do make the bonds of this Ward within the Walls.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e <HI>More-Fields,</HI> you have formerly read, what a Moori&s;h rotten ground they were, unpa&s;&s;able, but for Caw&s;ways; purpo&s;ely made to that intent; what they were al&s;o in our own nearer times of Memory, even till Sir <HI>Leonard Halliday</HI> was Lord Major of <HI>London,</HI> Iam very well a&s;&s;ured many do perfectly remember. And what they are now at this in&s;tant by the honour|able co&s;t and care of this City, and the indu&s;trious pains and diligence of that worthy Cittizen Mr. <HI>Nicolas Leate,</HI> we all (to our continuall comfort) do evidently behold.</P>
<P>Then to turn back again, through the &s;aid <HI>Po&s;ternlane</HI> to <HI>More-lane,</HI> which
<PB N="302" REF="71">
<HI>More-lane,</HI> with all the Allies and buildings there, is of this Ward. After that is <HI>Grub-Street</HI> more then half thereof to the Streightning of the Street, Next is <HI>White-Cro&s;&s;e-Street,</HI> up to the End of <HI>Beech-lane,</HI> and then <HI>Red-Cro&s;&s;e-Street,</HI> wholly with a part of <HI>Golding-lane,</HI> even to the po&s;ts there placed, as a bounder.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Beech lane</HI> before &s;poken of; the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the <HI>Red-Cro&s;&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>Barbican-Street,</HI> more than halfe thereof toward <HI>Alder&s;gate-Street.</HI></P>
<P>Touching the Antiquitie of this Old <HI>Aldermans-Bury</HI> or Court, I have not read other, then that <HI>Richard Kenery,</HI> one of the Sheriffs of <HI>London;</HI> in the fir&s;t of <HI>Richard</HI> the fir&s;t, which was in the year of Chri&s;t 1189. gave to the Church of Saint <HI>Mary</HI> at <HI>O&s;ney</HI> by <HI>Oxford,</HI> certain grounds and rents in <HI>Alderman-Bury,</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> as appeareth by the Regi&s;ter of that Church, as is al&s;o entered into the <HI>Hu&s;tings</HI> of the Guild-Hall in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>This Old Bery, Court, or Hall continued, and the courts of the Major and Aldermen were continually holden there, untill the New <HI>Bery-Court,</HI> or Guild-Hall that now is, was builded and fini&s;hed, which Hall was fir&s;t begun to be founded in the year 1411, and was not fully fini&s;hed in twenty years after, The ruines of the Old Court Hall in <HI>Alderman-Bury-Street</HI> yet appear which of late hath bin imployed as a Carpenters yard, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Then is the pari&s;h Church of St. <HI>Mary Aldermanbury,</HI> a fair Church, with a Church-yard and Cloy&s;ter adjoyning. In the which Cloy&s;ter is hanged and fa&s;t|ned a Shanke-bone of a man (as is &s;aid) very great, and larger by three inches and a half, than that which hangeth in St. <HI>Laurence</HI> Church in the <HI>Jury,</HI> for it is in length twenty Eight inches and a half of a&s;&s;i&s;e, but not &s;o hard and Steely, like as the other; for the &s;ame is Leight, and &s;omewhat pory and &s;pongy. This bone is &s;aid to be found among&s;t the bones of men removed from the Charnell hou&s;e of <HI>Pauls,</HI> or rather from the Cloy&s;ter of <HI>Pauls</HI> Church.</P>
<P>Beneath this Church have ye <HI>Gay&s;pur-lane,</HI> which runneth down to <HI>London</HI> Wall, as is afore &s;hewed. In this lane, at the North end thereof, was (of old time) a hou&s;e of <HI>Nuns,</HI> which hou&s;e being in great decay <HI>William El&s;ing,</HI> Mercer, in the year of Chri&s;t 1329. the third of <HI>Edward</HI> of the third, began in place thereof the foundation of an Ho&s;pitall, for &s;u&s;tentation of one hundred blind men: Towards the erection whereof, he gave his two hou&s;es in the Pari&s;h|es of St. <HI>Alphage</HI> and our Ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Lady</HI> in <HI>Aldermanbury</HI> Near <HI>Cripplegate.</HI></P>
<P>This hou&s;e was after called a <HI>Priory</HI> or <HI>Ho&s;pitall</HI> of St. <HI>Mary</HI> the <HI>Virgin,</HI> found|ed in the year 1332. by <HI>W. El&s;ing</HI> for <HI>Canons</HI> Regular, the which <HI>W.</HI> became the fir&s;t Prior there.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame place where the afore&s;aid <HI>El&s;ing</HI> Spittle and priory, were formerly &s;cituated, there is now newly erected a Colledge for the Clergy of <HI>London,</HI> and Liberties thereof, called by the name of <HI>Sion-Colledge:</HI> And Almes-hou&s;es for twenty poor people, ten men and ten women.</P>
<P>This was done by the e&s;peciall care and paines of Mr. <HI>John Sim&s;on,</HI> Rector of St. <HI>Olaves</HI> Hart-Street <HI>London,</HI> one of the Executors of the la&s;t Will and Te&s;ta|ment of Mr. <HI>Thomas White,</HI> Doctor in Divinity, Vicar of S. <HI>Dun&s;tans</HI> in the We&s;t, and one of the Canons Re&s;identiary of S. <HI>Pauls</HI> Church <HI>London:</HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">e-named <HI>Thomas White,</HI> (be&s;ides &s;undry &s;ums of money, and great yearly Revenues given by him to pious and Charitable u&s;es in divers places) gave three thou&s;and pound to purcha&s;e and build the afore&s;aid Colledge for the u&s;e of the Clergy, and Almes-hou&s;es for the twenty poor people afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>He gave al&s;o unto the &s;aid Colledge, and Almes-hou&s;es, a hundred &s;ixty pound, <HI>per annum</HI> for ever; whereof there is a hundred twenty pound yearly allowed for the maintenance of the poor Almes-men and women: And forty pound yearly for four dinners for the Clergy, who are to have four Latine Sermons in the year one every quarter, and upon the&s;e dayes are to dine together in the Col|ledge.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="71">
In the &s;ame Colledge the forenamed <HI>John Sim&s;on</HI> did in his life time, at his own proper Co&s;ts and Charges, build a very faire and &s;pacious Library, con|taining, a hundred twenty one foot in length, within the Walls, and above twenty five foot in breadth. And hath furni&s;hed it with Wain&s;cot, Stalls, Desks, Seats, and other Nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;efull Ornaments befitting the place.</P>
<P>To this Library there have been already divers bountifull, and well di&s;po&s;ed Benefactors, who have given large &s;ums of money towards the furni&s;hing of it with Books.</P>
<P>Then is there the Pari&s;h Church of Saint <HI>Alphage;</HI> The principall Ile of this Church towards the North, was pulled down, and a frame of four hou&s;es &s;et up in the place: the other part, from the Steeple upward, was converted into a Pari&s;h Church of S. <HI>Alphage;</HI> and the Pari&s;h Church which &s;tood near unto the Wall of the City by <HI>Cripplegate,</HI> was pulled down; the plot thereof made a Carpenters Yard, with Saw-pits.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ho&s;pitall</HI> it &s;elf, the <HI>Prior,</HI> and Canons hou&s;e, with other Lodgings were made a dwelling hou&s;e, the Church-Yard is a Garden plot, and a faire Gallery on the Cloy&s;ter; the Lodgins for the poor are tran&s;lated into &s;tabling for hor&s;es.</P>
<P>Now we will return to <HI>Milk-Street</HI> &s;o call'd of Milke &s;old there at the be|ginning. In this <HI>Milk-Street,</HI> is a &s;mall Pari&s;h Church of Saint <HI>Mary Mag|delen,</HI> which hath of late years been repaired. <HI>William Brown,</HI> Mayor 1513. gave to this Church fourty pounds, and was buried there.</P>
<P>Then Next is <HI>Wood-Street,</HI> by what rea&s;on &s;o called, I know not. True it is, that (of old time) according to a Decree made in the reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the fir&s;t, the hou&s;es of <HI>London</HI> were builded of Stone, for defence of fire, which kind of building was u&s;ed for two hundred years or more, but of latter time, for the winning of ground, taken down; and hou&s;es of Timber were &s;et up in their place. It &s;eemeth therefore that this Street hath been of the latter build|ing, all of timber, (for &s;carce one hou&s;e of &s;tone hath been known there) and therefore called <HI>Wood-Street:</HI> otherwi&s;e it might take the name of &s;ome buil|der or owner thereof.</P>
<P>On the Ea&s;t &s;ide of this Street is one of the Pri&s;on-hou&s;es, pertaining to the <HI>Sheriffs</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> and is called the <HI>Compter</HI> in <HI>Wood-Street,</HI> which was pre|pared to be a pri&s;on-hou&s;e in the year 1555. And on the Eve of S. <HI>Michael</HI> the Archangell, the pri&s;oners that lay in the Compter in <HI>Bread-Street,</HI> were remo|ved to this Compter in <HI>Wood-Street.</HI> Beneath this Compter in <HI>Lad-lane,</HI> or <HI>Ladle Hall,</HI> for &s;o I find it of Record, in the pari&s;h of Saint <HI>Michaell Wood-Street;</HI> and Beneath that is <HI>Love lane,</HI> &s;o called of <HI>wantons.</HI></P>
<P>By this lane is the Ancient pari&s;h Church of S. <HI>Albans.</HI> One note of the great Antiquity of it, is the name, by which it was at fir&s;t dedicated to St. <HI>Albanus,</HI> the fir&s;t Martyr of England. Another Character of the Antiquity of it, is to be &s;een in the manner of the turning of the Arches in the windows, and heads of the Pillars. A third Note, appears in the <HI>Roman</HI> Bricks, here and there inlayed among&s;t the &s;tones of the building. Very probable it is, that this Church is at lea&s;t of as ancient a &s;tanding as King <HI>Aldel&s;tane</HI> the <HI>Saxon,</HI> who, as the Tradition &s;ayes, had his hou&s;e at the Ea&s;t end of this Church. This Kings hou&s;e, having adoor al|&s;o into <HI>Adel-Street</HI> in this Pari&s;h, gave name, as 'tis thought, unto the &s;aid <HI>Adel-Street,</HI> which in all Evidences to this day, is written King <HI>Adel-Street.</HI> One great &s;quare Tower of this Kings hou&s;e &s;eems yet remaining, to be &s;een at the North corner of <HI>Love lane,</HI> as you come from <HI>Alderman-bury;</HI> which Tower is of the very &s;ame &s;tone and manner of building with S. <HI>Albans</HI> Church.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o (but without any outward Monument) the head of <HI>James</HI> the Fourth King of <HI>Scots</HI> of that name, &s;lain at <HI>Flodden</HI> field, and buried here by this occa&s;ion: After the Battell, the body of the &s;aid King being found, was clo&s;ed
<PB N="304" REF="72">
in lead, and conveyed from thence to <HI>London,</HI> and &s;o to the Mona&s;tery of <HI>Sheine</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> where it remained for a time, in what order I am not certain: But &s;ince the di&s;&s;olution of that hou&s;e, in the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Sixth, <HI>Henry Gray</HI> Duke of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> being lodged and keeping hou&s;e there, the &s;ame body was to be &s;hew'd, &s;o lapped in lead, clo&s;e to the head and body, thrown into a wa&s;te room among&s;t the old timber, lead, &amp; other rubble; &s;ince which time, the work|men there (for their fooli&s;h plea&s;ure) hewed off his head; and <HI>Launcelot Young,</HI> Ma&s;ter Gla&s;ier to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> feeling a &s;weet &s;avour to come from thence, and &s;eeing the &s;ame dried from all moi&s;ture, and yet the form remaining, with the hair of the head and beard red, brought it into <HI>London,</HI> to his hou&s;e in <HI>Wood-&s;treet,</HI> where (for a time) he kept it for the &s;weetne&s;&s;e; but in the end, cau&s;ed the Sexton of that Church, to bury it among&s;t other bones, taken out of their Charnell, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There are divers Records of a hou&s;e in <HI>Wood-&s;treet,</HI> then called <HI>Black Hall,</HI> but no man at this day can tell thereof. On the North &s;ide of this Saint <HI>Mi|chaels</HI> Church is <HI>Maiden-lane,</HI> now &s;o called, but (of old time) <HI>Ingene-lane,</HI> or <HI>Inglane.</HI> In this Lane the <HI>Wax-Chaundlers</HI> have their Common Hall, on the the South &s;ide thereof; and the <HI>Haberda&s;hers</HI> have their Hall on the North &s;ide, at <HI>Stayning-lane</HI> end. This Company of the <HI>Haberda&s;hers,</HI> or <HI>Hurrers,</HI> of old time &s;o called, were incorporated a Brotherhood of St. <HI>Katherines,</HI> the twenty &s;ixth of <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, and &s;o confirmed by <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, the &s;e|venteenth of his Reign; the <HI>Cappers</HI> and <HI>Hat-Merchants,</HI> or <HI>Hurrers,</HI> being one Company of <HI>Haberda&s;hers.</HI></P>
<P>Down lower in <HI>VVood-street</HI> is <HI>Silver-&s;treet</HI> (I think, of Silver-Smiths dwel|ling there) in which be divers fair hou&s;es.</P>
<P>And on the North &s;ide thereof is <HI>Monks-well</HI> &s;treet, &s;o called, of a well, at the North end thereof, where the Abbot of <HI>Garendon</HI> had an home or Cell, called <HI>Saint James</HI> in the wall by <HI>Cripple-gate,</HI> and certain Monks of their hou&s;e were Chaplains there; wherefore the Well (belonging to that Cell or Hermitage) was called <HI>Monks-well,</HI> and the &s;treet of the well, <HI>Monks-well &s;treet.</HI> The Ea&s;t &s;ide of this &s;treet down again&s;t <HI>London</HI> wall, and the South &s;ide thereof to <HI>Crip|ple-gate,</HI> be of <HI>Cripple-gate</HI> Ward, as is afore-&s;hewed.</P>
<P>In this &s;treet, by the corner of <HI>Monks-well &s;treet,</HI> is the <HI>Bowyers Hall.</HI> On the Ea&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Monks-well &s;treet,</HI> be convenient Alm&s;-hou&s;es, <HI>twelve</HI> in num|ber, founded by Sir <HI>Ambro&s;e Nicholas,</HI> Salter, Maior, 1575. wherein he placed twelve poor and aged people rent-free, having each of them &s;even pence the week, and once the yeer each of them five &s;acks of <HI>Charcoals,</HI> and one quartern of one hundred of <HI>Faggots,</HI> of his gift for ever.</P>
<P>On the North &s;ide of the way, turning towards <HI>Cripple-gate,</HI> and even upon, or clo&s;e to <HI>London</HI> wall, (as it were) are certain new erected <HI>Alme&s;-hou&s;es,</HI> &s;ix in number, of the co&s;t and gift of Mr. <HI>Robert Rogers,</HI> Leather-Seller, and very good maintenance allowed (for ever) to &s;uch people as are appointed to dwell in them.</P>
<P>Then, in little <HI>VVood-&s;treet,</HI> be &s;even proper Chambers in an Alley on the We&s;t &s;ide, founded for &s;even poor people, therein to dwell rent-free, by <HI>Henry Barton,</HI> Skinner, Maior, 1516.</P>
<P>Now without the Po&s;tern of <HI>Cripple-gate,</HI> fir&s;t is the Pari&s;h Church of Saint <HI>Giles,</HI> a very fair and large Church, lately repaired, after that the &s;ame was burn|ed, in the yeer 1545, the thirty &s;eventh of <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, by which mi&s;|chance, the Monuments of the dead in this Church are very few.</P>
<P>In <HI>VVhite Cro&s;&s;e-&s;treet</HI> King <HI>Henry</HI> the Fifth builded a fair hou&s;e, and founded there a <HI>Brotherhood</HI> of S. <HI>Giles</HI> to be kept, which hou&s;e had &s;ometime been an Ho&s;pitall of the <HI>French</HI> Order, by the name of Saint <HI>Giles</HI> without <HI>Cripple-gate.</HI> In the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the Fir&s;t, the King having the Juri&s;diction, and pointing a <HI>Cu&s;tos</HI> thereof, for the Precinct of the Pari&s;h of Saint <HI>Giles,</HI> &amp;c. which Ho&s;pi|tall
<PB N="305" REF="72">
being &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the lands were given to the Brotherhood for relief of the poor.</P>
<P>One Alley, of divers Tenements, over again&s;t the North wall of Saint <HI>Giles</HI> Church-yard, was appointed to be <HI>Alm&s;-hou&s;es,</HI> for the poor, wherein they dwelled rent-free, and otherwi&s;e were releeved; but the &s;aid Brotherhood was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by <HI>Henry</HI> the Eighth, &s;ince which time, Sir <HI>John Gre&s;ham,</HI> Maior, pur|cha&s;ed the lands, and gave part thereof to the maintenance of a <HI>Free School,</HI> which he had founded at <HI>Holt,</HI> a Market-town in <HI>Norfolk.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Red Cro&s;&s;e-&s;treet,</HI> on the We&s;t &s;ide from S. <HI>Giles</HI> Church-yard, up to the &s;aid Cro&s;&s;e, be many fair hou&s;es builded outward, with divers Alleys, turning into a large plot of ground, of old time called the <HI>Jews Garden,</HI> as being the only place appointed them in <HI>England,</HI> wherein to bury their dead, till the year 1177, the twenty fourth of <HI>Henry</HI> the Second, that it was permitted them (after long &s;uit to the King and Parliament at <HI>Oxford)</HI> to have a &s;peciall place a&s;&s;igned them in every quarter where they dwelled.</P>
<P>On the Ea&s;t &s;ide of this <HI>Red Cro&s;&s;e-&s;treet,</HI> be al&s;o divers fair hou&s;es, up to the <HI>Cro&s;&s;e,</HI> and there is <HI>Beech-lane,</HI> peradventure &s;o called of <HI>Nicholas de la Beech,</HI> Lievtenant of the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> put out of that office in the thirteenth of <HI>Edward</HI> the Third. This Lane &s;tretcheth from <HI>Red Cro&s;&s;e-&s;treet</HI> to <HI>VVhite Cro&s;&s;e-&s;treet,</HI> repleni&s;hed not with Beech trees, but with beautifull hou&s;es of Stone, Brick, and Timber: Among&s;t the which was (of old time) a great hou&s;e per|taining to the Abbot of <HI>Ram&s;ey,</HI> for his lodging, when he repaired to the City; it is now called <HI>Drewry Hou&s;e,</HI> of Sir <HI>Drew Drewry,</HI> who dwelt there.</P>
<P>On the North &s;ide of this <HI>Beech-lane,</HI> towards <HI>VVhite Cro&s;&s;e &s;treet,</HI> the <HI>Dra|pers</HI> of <HI>London</HI> have lately builded eight <HI>Alm&s;-hou&s;es</HI> of Brick and Timber, for eight poor widows of their own Company, whom they placed there rent-free.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Golding-lane: Richard Gallard</HI> of <HI>I&s;lington</HI> E&s;quire, Citizen and <HI>Painter-Stainer</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> founded thirteen <HI>Alm&s;-hou&s;es,</HI> for &s;o many poor peo|ple placed in them rent-free.

<P>The Steeple of this Church was builded and fini&s;hed in the year 1222. The Cro&s;&s;e on the &s;aid Steeple fell down, and a new was &s;et up in the year 1314.</P>
<P>The new work of <HI>Pauls</HI> (&s;o called) at the Ea&s;t end above the Quire, was be|gun in the year 1251. <HI>Henry Lacy,</HI> Earl of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> Con&s;table of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and Cu&s;tos of <HI>England,</HI> in his time was a great Benefactor to this work, and was there buried, in the year 1310.</P>

The inner Body of this Cro&s;&s;e was Oak, the next Cover was lead, and the outermo&s;t was of Copper red varni&s;hed. The Bole and Eagle, or Cock, were of Copper, and gilt al&s;o. The height of the Steeple was 520 Foot, whereof the Stone-work was 260 Foot, and the Spire was likewi&s;e 260 Foot. The length of the whole Church is 240 Taylors yards, which make 720 Foot.

<P>Towards the We&s;t end of <HI>Knight-Riders</HI> &s;treet, is the Pari&s;h Church of Saint <HI>Nicholas Cold Abbey,</HI> a proper Church &s;omewhat ancient, as appeateth by the waies ray&s;ed there about, &s;o that men are forced to de&s;cend into the body of the Church, it hath been called of many <HI>Colden Abbey,</HI> of &s;ome Cold Abbey or Cold Bay, and &s;o have the mo&s;t ancient Writings; as &s;tanding in a cold place, as <HI>Cold Harbor,</HI> and &s;uch like, the Steeple or tall Tower of this Church, with the South Ile, hath been of later building, to wit, the fir&s;t of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, when it was meant, that the whole old Church &s;hould have been new buil|ded, as appeareth by the Arching begun on the Ea&s;t &s;ide the Steeple, under the which, in the Stone work, the Armes of one <HI>Buckland,</HI> E&s;quire, and his Wife, Daughter to <HI>Beaupere,</HI> are cut in Stone, and al&s;o are in the Gla&s;&s;e Win|dows, whereby it appeareth, he was the Builder thereof, and Repairer of the re&s;idue.</P>
<P>In <HI>Trinity</HI> Lane, on the We&s;t &s;ide thereof, is the <HI>Painter Stainers</HI> Hall, for &s;o of old time were they called, but now that workman&s;hip of <HI>Staining</HI> is depar|ted and out of u&s;e in <HI>England.</HI> Lower down in <HI>Trinity</HI> Lane, on the Ea&s;t &s;ide thereof, was &s;ometime a great-Me&s;&s;uage pertaining unto <HI>John</HI> Earl of <HI>Cornwall,</HI> in the fourteenth of <HI>Edward</HI> the third.</P>
<P>On <HI>Bread-&s;treet</HI> Hill, down to the <HI>Thames,</HI> on both &s;ides, be divers fair Hou&s;es, inhabited by Fi&s;hmongers, Chee&s;emongers, and Merchants of divers Trades; on the We&s;t &s;ide whereof is the Pari&s;h Church of St. <HI>Nicholas Olave,</HI> a convenient Church.</P>
<P>The next is <HI>Old Fi&s;h-&s;treet</HI> Hill, a pa&s;&s;age &s;o called, which al&s;o runneth down to <HI>Thames</HI> &s;treet; In this Lane, on the Ea&s;t &s;ide thereof, is the one end of <HI>Fini|more</HI> or Five foot Lane.</P>
<P>On the We&s;t &s;ide of this Old <HI>Fi&s;h-</HI>&s;treet Hill, is the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Hereford's</HI> Inne, or lodging, an ancient Hou&s;e, and large rooms, builded of Stone and Timber, which &s;ometime belonged to the <HI>Mounthaunts</HI> in <HI>Norfolke. Radul|phus de Mayden-&s;tone,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Hereford</HI> about the year, one thou&s;and two hundred thirty four, bought it of the <HI>Mounthaunts,</HI> and gave it to the Bi|&s;hops of <HI>Hereford</HI> his Succe&s;&s;ors. <HI>Charles,</HI> both Bi&s;hop of <HI>Hereford,</HI> and Chan|cellour of the Marches, about the year 1517 repaired it, &s;ince the which time, the &s;ame is greatly ruined, and is now divided into many &s;mall Tenements; The Hall, and principall Rooms, are an Hou&s;e to make Sugar-Loaves, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Next adjoyning is the Pari&s;h Church of Saint <HI>Mary de Monte</HI> al&s;o, or <HI>Mounthaunt;</HI> this is a very &s;mall Church, and at the fir&s;t builded to be a Chappel for the &s;aid Hou&s;e of the <HI>Mounthaunts,</HI> and for Tenements there un|to belonging.</P>
<P>On the Ea&s;t &s;ide of this Old <HI>Fi&s;h-</HI>&s;treet Hill, is one great Hou&s;e, now letten out for Rent, which Hou&s;e &s;ometime was one of the Halls pertai|ning to the Company of <HI>Fi&s;hmongers,</HI> at &s;uch time as they had &s;ix Hall-Motes
<PB N="322" REF="81">
or Meeting places, namely, twain in <HI>Bridge-&s;treet,</HI> or New <HI>Fi&s;h-&s;treet,</HI> twain in Old <HI>Fi&s;h-&s;treet,</HI> whereof this was one, and twain in Stock-Fi&s;h|monger Row, or <HI>Thames</HI> &s;treet, as appeareth by a Record the twenty two of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd.</P>
<P>Next We&s;tward is one other Lane, called <HI>Lambart Hill,</HI> the Ea&s;t &s;ide whereof is wholly of this Ward, and but half the We&s;t &s;ide, to wit, from the North end of the <HI>Black-&s;miths</HI> Hall.</P>
<P>Then in <HI>Thames</HI> &s;treet, of this Ward, and on the North &s;ide over again&s;t the Queens <HI>Hith,</HI> is the Pari&s;h Church of Saint <HI>Michael</HI> a con|venient Church, but all the Monuments therein are defaced.</P>
<P>At the We&s;t end of that Church, goeth up a Lane, called <HI>Pyel-lane;</HI> on the &s;ame North &s;ide, at the South end of Saint <HI>Mary Mounthaunt</HI> Lane, is the Pari&s;h Church of Saint <HI>Summer&s;et,</HI> over again&s;t the <HI>Broken-Wharfe.</HI></P>
<P>Then is a &s;mall Pari&s;h Church of St. <HI>Peter,</HI> called <HI>parva,</HI> or little, near unto <HI>Pauls</HI> Wharf. In this Church no Monuments do remain.</P>
<P>At the We&s;t end thereof is a Lane called Saint <HI>Peters</HI> Hill; but two Hou&s;es up that Lane, on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, is of this Ward, and the re&s;t is of <HI>Ca|&s;tle Baynards</HI> Ward.</P>
<P>On the South &s;ide of <HI>Thames</HI> &s;treet, beginning again in the Ea&s;t a|mong the Cooks, the fir&s;t in this Ward, is the Signe of <HI>David</HI> the King.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Towns-end</HI> Lane, turning down to the <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>Then is <HI>Queen-hithe,</HI> a large receptacle for Ships, Lighters, Barges, and &s;uch other Ve&s;&s;els. Touching the Antiquity and u&s;e of this Gate and Hithe, fir&s;t I find, that the &s;ame belonged to one named <HI>Edred,</HI> and was then called <HI>Edreds Hith,</HI> which &s;ince falling into the hands of King <HI>Stephen,</HI> it was by his Charter confirmed to <HI>William de Ypre,</HI> the Farm thereof in Fee and in He|ritage; <HI>William de Ypre,</HI> gave i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> unto the Prior and Covent of the <HI>Holy Trinity</HI> within <HI>Ealdgate.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Edreds Hith,</HI> after the fore&s;aid Grant, came again to the Kings hands, by what means I have not read, but it pertained unto the Queen, and therefore was called <HI>Ripa Reginae,</HI> the Queens Bank, or <HI>Queens-Hith,</HI> and great profit thereof was made to her u&s;e, as may appear by this which fol|loweth.</P>
<P>King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, in the ninth of his Reign, commanded the Con|&s;tables of the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> to arre&s;t the Ships of the Cinque-Ports on the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> and to compell them to bring their Corn to no other place, but to the <HI>Queens Hith</HI> only. In the eleaventh of his Reign, he charged the &s;aid Con&s;table, to di&s;train all Fi&s;h offered to be &s;old in any place of this City, but at the <HI>Queens Hith.</HI> Moreover, in the eight and twentieth of his Reign, an Inqui&s;ition was made before <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Yorke,</HI> and the Provo&s;t of <HI>Beverley, Henry</HI> of <HI>Bath,</HI> and <HI>Hierome</HI> of <HI>Caxton,</HI> Ju|&s;tices <HI>Itinerantes,</HI> &s;itting in the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> touching the Cu&s;toms of <HI>Queen-hith,</HI> ob&s;erved in the year la&s;t before the Wars between the King and his Father, and the Barons of <HI>England,</HI> and of old Cu&s;toms of other times, and what Cu&s;toms had been changed, at what time the Tax and Payment of all things coming thither, and between <HI>VVoore-path,</HI> and <HI>A|nede Hith,</HI> were found and &s;eized, according to the old Order, as well Corne and Fi&s;h, as of other things; All which Cu&s;tomes were as well to be ob&s;erved in the part of <HI>Down-gate,</HI> as in <HI>Queen-Hith,</HI> for the Kings u&s;e, when al&s;o it was found, that the Corn arriving between the Gate of Guild Hall, of the Merchants of <HI>Colleyne,</HI> and the Soke of the Arch-Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> (for he had a Hou&s;e near unto the <HI>Black-Fryers)</HI> was
<PB N="323" REF="81">
not to be mea&s;ured by any other quarter, than by that of the Queens Soke.</P>
<P>Next adjoyning to this <HI>Queen-hith,</HI> on the We&s;t &s;ide thereof, is <HI>Sult-Wharf,</HI> named of Salt taken up, mea&s;ured, and &s;old there.</P>
<P>The next is <HI>Stew</HI> Lane, of a Stew, or Hot-hou&s;e there kept.</P>
<P>After that is <HI>Timber-Hith,</HI> or Timber &s;treet, &s;o called, of Timber, or Boards, there taken up, and wharfed; it is in the Pari&s;h of Saint <HI>Mary Som|mers Hith,</HI> as we read in the fifty &s;ix of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, and in the ninth of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Brookes Wharfe,</HI> and <HI>Broken Wharfe,</HI> a Water-gate or Key, &s;o called of being broken and fallen down into the <HI>Thames.</HI></P>
<P>By this <HI>Broken-VVharfe</HI> remaineth one large old building of Stone, with Arched Gates; which Me&s;&s;uage, as we finde, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the third, the forty three year, pertained unto <HI>Hugh de Bigot,</HI> and in the eleaventh of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, to <HI>Thomas Brotherton,</HI> the Kings Brother, Earle of <HI>Norfolke,</HI> Mar&s;hall of <HI>England,</HI> in the eleaventh of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, to <HI>John Mowbray</HI> Duke of <HI>Norfolk, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Within the Gate of this Hou&s;e (now belonging to the City of <HI>Lon|don)</HI> is lately, to wit, in the year 1594. and 1595, builded one large Hou&s;e, of great height, called an Engine, made by <HI>Bevis Bulmar,</HI> Gentleman, for the conveying and forcing of Thames water, to &s;erve in the middle and We&s;t parts of the City; the ancient great Hall of this Me&s;&s;uage, is yet &s;tanding, and pertaining to a great Brew-Hou&s;e for Beere.</P>
<P>We&s;t from this is <HI>Trigge</HI> Lane, going down to the <HI>Thames.</HI> Next is called <HI>Bo&s;&s;e-</HI>Lane of a Bo&s;&s;e of water, like unto that of <HI>Beling&s;gate,</HI> there placed by the Executors of <HI>Richard Whittington.</HI></P>
<P>Then is one great Me&s;&s;uage, &s;ometime belonging to the Abbots of <HI>Chart&s;ey,</HI> in <HI>Surrey,</HI> and was their Inne, wherein they were lodged when they repaired to the City: it is now called <HI>Sandle</HI> Hou&s;e, by what rea&s;on we have not heard; &s;ome think the Lord <HI>Sands</HI> hath been lodged there.</P>

<P>There be al&s;o the&s;e five Pri&s;ons, or Goals, the <HI>Clink</HI> on the Bank, the <HI>Compter</HI> in the late Pari&s;h Church of St. <HI>Margaret,</HI> the <HI>Mar&s;hal&s;ey,</HI> the <HI>Kings-Bench,</HI> and the <HI>White-Lyon,</HI> all in <HI>Long Southwarke.</HI></P>
<P>Now to return to the We&s;t Bank, there were two <HI>Bear-Gardens,</HI> the old and new, places wherein were kept <HI>Bears, Bulls,</HI> and other Bea&s;ts, to be bated; As al&s;o Ma&s;tives, in &s;everal Kenels, nouri&s;hed to baite them.

<P>In a Parliament holden at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> the eight of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;econd, it was ordained by the Commons, and confirmed by the King and Lords, That divers con&s;titutions for ever &s;hould he kept in that Lord&s;hip or Franchi&s;e, according to the old Cu&s;toms, that had been there u&s;ed time out of mind; Among&s;t the which, the&s;e following were &s;ome, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>The&s;e allowed <HI>Stew-hou&s;es</HI> had Signs on their Fronts, towards the <HI>Thames,</HI> not hanged out, but <HI>painted</HI> on the Walls, as a <HI>Boars</HI> head, the <HI>Cro&s;&s;e-Keys,</HI> the <HI>Gun,</HI> the <HI>Ca&s;tle,</HI> the <HI>Crane,</HI> the <HI>Cardinals Hat,</HI> the <HI>Bell,</HI> the <HI>Swan, &amp;c.</HI> Ancient men of good credit do report, that the&s;e &s;ingle Women were forbidden the <HI>Rights of the Church</HI> &s;o long as they continued that finful life, and were exclu|ded from Chri&s;tian burial, if they were not reconciled, before their death: And therefore there was a plot of ground called the <HI>Single Womans Church-yard,</HI> ap|pointed for them, far from the Pari&s;h Church.</P>
<P>In the year of Chri&s;t, one thou&s;and five hundred forty &s;ix, the &s;even and thir|tieth of <HI>Henry the</HI> eighth, this Row of <HI>Stews</HI> in <HI>Southwarke,</HI> was put down by the Kings commandement, which was proclaimed by &s;ound of Trumpet, no more to be priviledg'd and u&s;ed as a common Brothel.</P>

Next is the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Winche&s;ters Hou&s;e,</HI> or Lodging when he com|meth to this City.</P>
<P>Adioyning to this on the South &s;ide thereof, is the <HI>Bi&s;hop of Roche&s;ters Inne,</HI> or lodging, by whom fir&s;t erected, it is not upon Record; but 'tis known well, the &s;ame of longtime hath not been frequented by any Bi&s;hop, and lieth rui|nous for lack of reparations.

This Church was again new builded in the Reign of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, and King <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth.</P>
<P><HI>John Gower</HI> E&s;quire, a famous Poet, was then an e&s;pecial Benefactor to that work, and was there buried on the North &s;ide of the &s;aid Church, in the Chap|pel of St. <HI>John,</HI> where he founded a Chantry; He lyeth under a Tombe of Stone, with his Image al&s;o of Stone over him; The Hair of his Head <HI>auburne,</HI> long to his Shoulders, but curling up and a &s;mall forked Beard: on his Head a Chaplet, like a Coronet of four Ro&s;es, an habit of Purple damasked down to his feet, a <HI>Collar of E&s;&s;es of Gold</HI> about his Neck, under his Feet the likene&s;&s;e of three Books, which he compiled. The fir&s;t named <HI>Speculum Meditantis,</HI> writ|ten in <HI>French;</HI> The &s;econd, <HI>Vox clamantis,</HI> penned in <HI>Latine;</HI> The third, <HI>Con|fe&s;&s;io Amantis,</HI> written in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and this la&s;t is printed; <HI>Vox Clamantis,</HI> with his <HI>Chronica Tripartita,</HI> &amp; other both in <HI>Latine</HI> and <HI>French,</HI> were never printed.

<P>Now pa&s;&s;ing through St. <HI>Mary Overies Clo&s;e</HI> (once in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Lord <HI>Montacute)</HI> &amp; <HI>Pepper Alley</HI> into <HI>Long Southwark;</HI> on the right hand thereof the Market Hill, where the Leather is &s;old, there &s;tood the late named Pari&s;h Church of Saint <HI>Margaret,</HI> given to St. <HI>Mary Overies</HI> by <HI>Henry</HI> the fir&s;t, put down and joyned with the Pari&s;h Church of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> and united to the late di&s;&s;olved <HI>Priory</HI> Church of St. <HI>Mary Overy.</HI></P>
<P>A part of this Pari&s;h Church of St. <HI>Margaret</HI> is now a <HI>Court</HI> wherein the A&s;&s;izes and Se&s;&s;ions be kept, and the Court of <HI>Admiralty</HI> is al&s;o there kept; one other part of the &s;ame Church is now a pri&s;on, called the <HI>Compter</HI> in <HI>South|warke, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Farther up on that &s;ide, almo&s;t directly over again&s;t St. <HI>Georges Church,</HI> was &s;ometime a large and mo&s;t &s;umptuous hou&s;e, builded by <HI>Charles Brandon,</HI> Duke

of <HI>Suffolke,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, which was called <HI>Suffolk Hou&s;e,</HI> but coming afterwards into the Kings hands, the &s;ame was called <HI>Southwark place,</HI> and a <HI>Mint</HI> of Coynage was there kept for the King. Queen <HI>Mary</HI> gave this Hou&s;e to <HI>Nicholas Heth,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> and to his Succe&s;&s;ors for ever, to be their Inne or Lodging for their repair to <HI>London,</HI> in recompence of <HI>York Hou&s;e</HI> near to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> which King <HI>Henry</HI> her Father had taken from <HI>Cardinal Wool&s;ey,</HI> and from the See of <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>Then is the <HI>White Lion,</HI> a Goal &s;o called, for that the &s;ame was a common Ho|&s;tery for the receit of Travellers by that Sign. This Hou&s;e was fir&s;t u&s;ed as a Goal within the&s;e hundred years la&s;t, &s;ince the which time the pri&s;oners were once removed thence to an Hou&s;e in <HI>New-town,</HI> where they remained for a &s;hort time, and were returned again to the afore&s;aid <HI>White Lion,</HI> there to remain as the appointed Goal for the Countey of <HI>Surrey.</HI></P>
<P>Next is the Goal or Pri&s;on of the <HI>Kings-Bench,</HI> but of what antiquity the &s;ame is, it appears not. We read, that the Courts of the <HI>Kings-Bench</HI> and <HI>Chan|cery,</HI> have oft times been removed from <HI>London</HI> to other places, and &s;o hath likewi&s;e the other Goals that &s;erve tho&s;e Courts, as in the year 1304, <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t commanded the Courts of <HI>Kings-Bench</HI> &amp; the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> which had remai|ned &s;even years at <HI>York,</HI> to be removed to their old places at <HI>London.</HI> And in the year 1387, the eleaventh of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, <HI>Robert Tri&s;ilian</HI> chief Ju&s;tice, came to the City of <HI>Coventry,</HI> and there &s;at by the &s;pace of a Month, as Ju&s;tice of the Kings Bench, and cau&s;ed to be Indicted in that Court about the number of 2000 per&s;ons of that Country, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It &s;eemeth therefore, that for that time the Pri&s;on or Goale of that Court was not far off. Al&s;o, in the year 1392, the &s;ix|teenth of the &s;ame <HI>Richard,</HI> the Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> being Lord Chancellor, for good will that he bare to his City, cau&s;ed the Kings Bench and Chancery to be removed from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>York,</HI> but ere long they were returned to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>Then is the <HI>Mar&s;hal&s;ey</HI> another Goal or Pri&s;on, &s;o called, as pertaining to the <HI>Mar&s;halls</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> of what continuance kept in <HI>Southwark,</HI> it appears not; but likely it is, that the &s;ame hath been removeable, at the plea&s;ure of the <HI>Mar|&s;halls.</HI> And then <HI>Thieves Lane</HI> by St. <HI>Thomas Ho&s;pital,</HI> fir&s;t found by <HI>Richard, Prior</HI> of <HI>Bermond&s;ey,</HI> in the <HI>Cellerers</HI> grounded, again&s;t the Wall of the Mona|&s;tery, in the year 1213, He named it the <HI>Almery,</HI> or hou&s;e of Alms, for <HI>Converts</HI> and poor Children.</P>
<P>In the year 1552, the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> having the void &s;uppre&s;&s;ed <HI>Ho&s;pital</HI> of St. <HI>Thomas</HI> in <HI>Southwark,</HI> in the Month of <HI>July,</HI> began the reparations there|of, for poor, impotent, lame, and di&s;ea&s;ed people, &s;o that in the Month of <HI>No|vember</HI> next following, the &s;ick and poor people were taken in,; And in the year 1553, on the tenth of <HI>April,</HI> King <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth in the &s;eventh of his Reign, gave to the Mayor, Communalty and Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> to be a Work-Hou&s;e for the poor, and idle per&s;ons of the City, his Hou&s;e of <HI>Bridewell,</HI> and &s;even hundred Marks Lands of the <HI>Savoy</HI> Rents, which Ho&s;pital he had &s;uppre&s;|&s;ed, with all the Beds, bedding, and other furniture belonging to the &s;ame, to|wards the maintenance of the &s;aid Work-hou&s;e of <HI>Bridewell,</HI> and of this Ho&s;pital of Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> in <HI>Southwark.</HI> This gift, the King confirmed by his Charter. The Church of this Ho&s;pital, which of old time &s;erved for the Tenements neer adjoyning and pertaining to the &s;aid Ho&s;pital, remaineth as a Pari&s;h Church.</P>
<P>But now to come to St. <HI>Olaves</HI> &s;treet: on the Bank of the River of Thames, is the Pari&s;h Church of St. <HI>Olave,</HI> a fair and meetly large Church, but a far larger Pari&s;h, e&s;pecially of Aliens or &s;trangers, and poor people.</P>
<P>Next is the Bridge-Hou&s;e, &s;o called, as being a Store-hou&s;e for Stone, Tim|ber, or what&s;oever pertaining to the building or repairing of <HI>London</HI> Bridge.</P>
<P>This Hou&s;e &s;eemeth to have taken beginning with the fir&s;t founding of the Bridge, either of Stone or Timber; it is a large plot of ground on the Bank of the River of Thames, containing divers large buildings, for &s;towage of things ne|ce&s;&s;ary,

towards reparation of the &s;aid Bridge. There are al&s;o divers <HI>Garners,</HI> for laying up of <HI>Wheat,</HI> and other Granaries for &s;ervice of the City, as need re|quireth. Moreover, there be certain Ovens builded, in number ten, of which &s;ix be very large the other four being but half &s;o big: the&s;e were purpo&s;ely made to bake out the Bread Corn of the &s;aid <HI>Grayners,</HI> to the be&s;t advantage, for relief of the poor Cittizens, when need &s;hould require.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Battaile Bridge,</HI> &s;o called of <HI>Battaile Abbey,</HI> for that it &s;tandeth on the ground &amp; over a Water-cour&s;e, (flowing out of Thames) pertaining to that Abbey, and was therefore both builded and repaired by the <HI>Abbots</HI> of that Hou&s;e, as being hard adjoyning to the Abbots Lodging.</P>
<P>Beyond this Bridge is <HI>Bermond&s;ey</HI> &s;treet, turning South, in the South end whereof was &s;ometime a Priory or Abby, of St. <HI>Saviour,</HI> called <HI>Bermonds Eye</HI> in <HI>Southwarke,</HI> founded by <HI>Ailwin,</HI> a Citizen of <HI>London,</HI> in the year 1081.</P>
<P>In the year 1094, decea&s;ed <HI>Alwin,</HI> founder of this Hou&s;e. Then <HI>William Rufus</HI> gave to the Monks, his Mannor of <HI>Bermond&s;ey,</HI> with the appurtenances, and builded there for them a new great Church.</P>
<P>In the year 1539. this <HI>Abbey</HI> was valued to di&s;pend by the year, 474 <HI>l.</HI> four|teen &s;hillings four pence half penny, and was &s;urrendred to <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth, the one and thirtieth of his Reign, the Abbey Church was then pulled down by Sir <HI>Thomas Pope</HI> Knight, and in place thereof, a goodly Hou&s;e builded of Stone and Timber, &s;ince pertaining to the Earls of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex.</HI> Next unto this <HI>Abbey</HI> Church &s;tandeth a proper Church of St. <HI>Mary Magdalen,</HI> builded by the Priory of <HI>Bermond&s;ey,</HI> &s;erving for re&s;ort of the Inhabitants (Tenants to the Priors or Abbots near adjoyning) there to have their <HI>Divine Service;</HI> this Church re|maineth and &s;erveth as afore, and is called a Pari&s;h Church. Then in <HI>Kent</HI> &s;treet, is a <HI>Lazar</HI> Hou&s;e for <HI>Leprous people,</HI> called the <HI>Loke</HI> in <HI>Southwark,</HI> the foundation whereof is incertain.</P>
<P>This <HI>Borough</HI> at a &s;ub&s;idy to the King, was u&s;ed to yield about a thou&s;and Marks, or eight hundred pounds, which is more than any one City in <HI>England</HI> payeth except <HI>London;</HI> And al&s;o, the Mu&s;ter of men in this Borough doth like|wi&s;e in number &s;urpa&s;&s;e all other Cities, except <HI>London.</HI> And thus much for the <HI>Borough</HI> of <HI>Southwarke,</HI> one of the &s;ix and twenty Wards of <HI>London.</HI></P>

<P>This demoli&s;h'd <HI>Charter-Hou&s;e,</HI> came a while after, to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Tho|mas Earl of Suffolk,</HI> Lord Trea&s;urer of <HI>England,</HI> in King <HI>James</HI> his Raign, and the place being &s;weetly &s;cituated, with accommodations of &s;pacious Walks, Orchards, and Gardens, with &s;undry dependencies of Tenements, and Lands thereunto belonging, gave occa&s;ion to that worthy and well di&s;po&s;ed Gentle|man, Mr. <HI>Thomas Sutton,</HI> of <HI>Castle</HI> Camps, in the County of <HI>Cambridge</HI> E&s;quire, but born at <HI>Knayth</HI> in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> to alter his Re&s;olution of erecting an Ho&s;|pital at <HI>Hallingbury</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> where he had fir&s;t pitched his de&s;ign, and to pur|cha&s;e this place of the Earl, for 13000 <HI>l.</HI> fir&s;t peny payd before the &s;ealing of the Conveyance; which charitable, great, and noble enterprize, was counte|nanced by King <HI>James,</HI> and his privy Councel.</P>
<P>So having in few years rai&s;ed up that goodly Fabrique, (though it plea&s;ed God to take him to him&s;elf, before it was quite fini&s;h'd) and endowed it with com|petent allowance, by pa&s;&s;ing away many goodly Mannors, he had in <HI>Lincoln, Wilt&s;hire, Middle&s;ex, Cambridge</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> with other goodly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, the work was compleated, and nominated the Ho&s;pital of King <HI>James;</HI> which Ho&s;pital, con&s;i&s;ted of a Ma&s;ter, a Governor, a Preacher, a Free School, with a Ma&s;ter and U&s;her, 80. poor people, and 40.

<P>A little without the.

<P>North from the &s;aid Hou&s;e of St. <HI>John's,</HI> was the Priory of <HI>Clarken-Well,</HI> which al&s;o was very ancient, being built <HI>Anno</HI> 1100.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t now go back to <HI>Gilt&s;pur-&s;treet,</HI> where this Suburb fir&s;t begins, where hard by &s;tandeth a comely fair Church, called St. <HI>Scpulcher,</HI> in the <HI>Baylic.</HI> Hard by is <HI>Turnagain-lane, Ho&s;ier-lane,</HI> and <HI>Cow-lane;</HI> then you come down <HI>Sorc-hill</HI> (now vulgarly called <HI>Snow-hill)</HI> to <HI>Oldborne,</HI> now called <HI>Holborn-</HI>Bridge: then you go up by <HI>Chick-lane,</HI> and <HI>Lither-lane;</HI> but before you come thither, you pa&s;&s;e by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Elies</HI> great Palace, and <HI>Hatton-Hou&s;e,</HI> and <HI>Brook-Hou&s;e:</HI> beyond the Barres, there is <HI>Po&s;tpool-lane,</HI> and <HI>Grayes Inne Lane.</HI></P>
<P>Southward of this Lane, there is a row of &s;mall Hou&s;es, which is a mighty hindrance to <HI>Holborn,</HI> in point of pro&s;pect, which if they were taken down, there would be from <HI>Holborn</HI> Conduit, to St. <HI>Giles</HI> in the field, one of the fair|e&s;t ri&s;ing &s;treet in the World.</P>

<P>Above the Barres, there was a Hou&s;e of the <HI>Tamplers,</HI> but they removed thence to <HI>Fleet&s;treet:</HI> There was al&s;o adjoining thereunto, the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lin|colns</HI> Hou&s;e, which was very ancient; for the Records &s;ay, 'twas built <HI>Anno</HI> 1147. But of late years, it hath belonged to the Noble Earls of <HI>Southhampton;</HI> And lately, it hath bin quite taken down, and turned to &s;everal private Tene|ments, as <HI>Durham</HI> Hou&s;e is in the Strand.

<P>Side long of this ancient Hou&s;e of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> is <HI>New&s;treet,</HI> for &s;o it was called at fir&s;t; but now 'tis called <HI>Chancery-lane,</HI> where <HI>Edward</HI> the third annexed the Hou&s;e of converted Jews, to the Office of <HI>Cu&s;tos Rotulorum.</HI></P>
<P>Here the <HI>Cur&s;itors</HI> Office was built by Sir <HI>Nicholas Bacon,</HI> Lord Keeper of the great Seal.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o is the &s;ix Clarks Office, which is a fair convenient peece of &s;tone and Brick Building newly erected, the old being con&s;umed by a ca&s;ual fire of late years. The Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chice&s;ter, Ralph Nevil,</HI> had much ground given him thereabouts, by <HI>Henry</HI> the third, which now is become all Tenements, thick built, and quite alienated.</P>
<P>Then is <HI>Lincolns Inne,</HI> very much encrea&s;ed in building, it appertained &s;ometimes to the &s;aid <HI>Ralph Nevil,</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chice&s;ter,</HI> Lord Chancellor of <HI>England,</HI> having bin before the Hou&s;e of the <HI>Black-Fryers:</HI> and after the decea&s;e of the &s;aid Bi&s;hop <HI>Nevil, Henry Lacy</HI> Earl of <HI>Lincoln,</HI> Con&s;table of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Cu&s;tos</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> added much building to this place; and Sir <HI>Thomas Lovel</HI> did al&s;o add much thereunto, in <HI>Henry</HI> the eighth's time; but now it is one of the foure Inns of Court, for the Students in the Law.</P>
<P>Behind <HI>Lincolns Inne</HI> We&s;tward, is a &s;pacious field, where many fair Hou&s;es, or rather Palaces, are taken up by the Gentry. Then is there towards <HI>Drewry</HI> Lane, a new Market, called <HI>Clare</HI> Market; then is there a &s;treet, and Palace of

<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1381.

<P>Now touching the Prerogatives, and enfranchi&s;ements of the Dutchy of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> let the Reader know, that <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, by his Royal Charter, and concurrence of Parliament, did &s;ever the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the &s;aid <HI>Dutchy</HI> from the Crown, And that which <HI>John of Gaunt</HI> hold for term of life, was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed to perpetuity, by the Statutes of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, and <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;e|venth: which &s;eparation was made by <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, in regard he well knew, that he had the Dutchy of <HI>Lanca&s;ter (par Regno)</HI> by &s;ure and indefe&s;ble Title, whereas his Title to the Crown was not &s;o a&s;&s;ured, becau&s;e that after the death of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, the Royal right was in the Heir of <HI>Lionel,</HI> Duke of <HI>Clarence,</HI> &s;econd Son of <HI>Edward</HI> the third. And <HI>John of Gaunt,</HI> who was Father to <HI>Henry</HI> the fourth, was the fourth Son: therefore his policy was, to make it a di&s;tinct thing from the Crown, for fear of after-claps.</P>
<P>It was <HI>Edward</HI> the third, who erected the County of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> to a County Palatine, and honoured the Duke of <HI>Lanca&s;ter</HI> therewith, giving him <HI>Jura Re|galia,</HI> having a particular Court, The Officers whereof, were the <HI>Chancellor,</HI> the <HI>Attorney,</HI> the <HI>Receiver General, Clark of the Court,</HI> the <HI>Auditors Surveyors,</HI> the <HI>Me&s;&s;enger;</HI> The Seal of the <HI>Dutchy of Lanca&s;ter</HI> remains with the <HI>Chancel|lor;</HI> but the Seal of the <HI>County Palatine,</HI> remains alwayes in a Che&s;t, in the <HI>County Palatine,</HI> under the &s;afe cu&s;tody of a Keeper.</P>
<P>Now, all Grants and Lea&s;es of Lands, Tenements, and Offices in the <HI>Coun|ty Palatine</HI> of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> &s;hould pa&s;&s;e under that Seal, and no other; but all

Grants and Lea&s;es out of the <HI>County Palatine,</HI> and within the Survey of the Dutchy, &s;hould pa&s;&s;e under the Seal of the Dutchy, and no other; otherwi&s;e &s;uch Grants are voyd, <HI>ip&s;o facto.</HI> Though this <HI>County Palatine</HI> was a younger Brother, yet it had more honours, mannors, and Lands annexed unto it, then any of the re&s;t; and all this by Acts of Parliament, whereby all the Franchi&s;es, Priviledges, Immunities, Quittances and Freedoms, which the Duke of <HI>Lan|ca&s;ter</HI> had for Him&s;elf and his Men, and Tenants, were confirmed.</P>
<P>The Liberty of the Dutchy was u&s;ed to be governed by the Chancellor, who had under him a Steward, that kept Court Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">t, with an Attorney of the Dutchy.

Ale-cunners, which looked to the a&s;&s;i&s;e of mea&s;ures, four Scavengers, and a Beadle, and the common Pri&s;on is <HI>Newgate.</HI></P>
<P>And now we mu&s;t make a &s;tep back towards <HI>Temple-barre,</HI> and &s;o by degrees, to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> all along, we will begin with the right hand, or the North &s;ide, and &s;o pa&s;&s;e up We&s;t, through a back lane or &s;treet, wherein do &s;tand (as was touched before) three Inns of <HI>Chancery,</HI> The fir&s;t called <HI>Clements Inne,</HI> in regard it is near St. <HI>Clements Church,</HI> and <HI>Clements Well.</HI> The &s;econd <HI>New Inne,</HI> which was made of a common Ho&s;tery, about the beginning of the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> 7.

<P>I have heard often of a Briti&s;h Prophecy, which came from an old <HI>Bard,</HI> viz. The Church man was, the Lawyer is, and the Souldier &s;hall be. True it is, that Bi&s;hops lived in the Equipage of Princes, in former times; and among other in&s;tances, one is, the goodly Palaces they had in and about <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter;</HI> for from <HI>Dor&s;et</HI> Hou&s;e in <HI>Fleetftreet,</HI> as far as <HI>White-hall,</HI> all the great Hou&s;es, which were built upon the Banks of the Thames, were all Epi&s;copal Palaces, except the <HI>Savoy</HI> and <HI>Suffolk-hou&s;e.</HI> The fir&s;t for greatne&s;s was <HI>Exce&s;ter</HI> Hou&s;e (now called <HI>E&s;&s;ex)</HI> where of the chiefe&s;t Founder was <HI>Edward Stapleton,</HI> Bi&s;hop of that See, who was beheaded by the <HI>Londoners</HI> in <HI>Cheap-&s;ide,</HI> and his Body was then brought, and buried in a heap of Sand or rubbi&s;h, in his own Hou&s;e near <HI>Temple-barre,</HI> in the Raign of <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;econd.</P>
<P>Bi&s;hop <HI>Edmond Luey,</HI> built the great Hall in the Raign of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth. The &s;ame was &s;ince called <HI>Paget-Hou&s;e,</HI> being enlarged by <HI>William</HI> Lord <HI>Paget.</HI> Then was it called <HI>Leice&s;ter-Hou&s;e,</HI> of <HI>Robert Dudley,</HI> who was the great Favo|rite to Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and then it came to be called <HI>E&s;&s;ex-hou&s;e,</HI> from <HI>Robert</HI> Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who was al&s;o a Favorite of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and beheaded in the Tower.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to this Hou&s;e, &s;tandeth the Pari&s;h-Church of Saint <HI>Clement Danes,</HI> &s;o called, becau&s;e <HI>Harold, a Dani&s;h</HI> King, with other of that Nation, were buried there.</P>
<P>Then was the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Baths Inne,</HI> or City-Hou&s;e, builded by the Lord <HI>Thomas Seamer,</HI> Admiral of <HI>England:</HI> which Hou&s;e, came afterwards to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Earl of <HI>Arundel,</HI> &amp; &s;o it beares the name of <HI>Arundel-hou&s;e:</HI> neer there adjoyning there was once a Pari&s;h-Church, called the <HI>Nativity of our Lady,</HI> or the <HI>Innocents of the Strand,</HI> with a fair Coemitery, or Church-yard, wherein there was a Brother-hood kept, called Saint <HI>Ur&s;ula</HI> of the <HI>Strand.</HI></P>
<P>Near adjoyning to the &s;aid Church, betwixt it and the Thames, there was an Inne of <HI>Chancery,</HI> called <HI>Che&s;ters Inne,</HI> becau&s;e it belonged to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and &s;ometimes 'twas called <HI>Strand</HI> Inne.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="94">
Then was there a Hou&s;e belonging to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Landaff,</HI> which one of tho&s;e Bi&s;hops purcha&s;ed of the Duke of <HI>Lanca&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>Then was there the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Che&s;ters</HI> Inne or Palace, which was fir&s;t built by <HI>Walter Langhton,</HI> Trea&s;urer of <HI>England,</HI> in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t. And not far from that was the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Worce&s;ters</HI> Inne or Palace; All which <HI>viz.</HI> The Pari&s;h Church called Saint <HI>Mary</HI> of the <HI>Strand, Strand Inne,</HI> with the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and Bi&s;hop of <HI>Worce&s;ters</HI> Hou&s;es, with all the Tenements adjoyning, were by commandement of <HI>Edward</HI> Duke of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> Uncle to <HI>Ed|ward</HI> the &s;ixth, &amp; Lord Protector pull'd down, and laid level to the ground <HI>An|no</HI> 1549. In place whereof, he erected that large and goodly Hou&s;e, call'd now <HI>Somer&s;et Hou&s;e,</HI> which ro&s;e out of the ruines of the Church; Therefore the <HI>Ro|man</HI> Catholiques ob&s;erved, that an apparent judgement from Heaven fell upon him afterwards, being beheaded a little after; and he and his Coun&s;el were &s;o infatuated, that he forgot to call for his Clergy, which he might have claimed by the Law, and &s;o &s;av'd his life.</P>
<P>Then is there <HI>Bedford</HI> Hou&s;e, which was &s;ometimes the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Carliles</HI> Inne. It &s;tretched from the <HI>Savoy</HI> to <HI>Ivie</HI> Bridge, where Sir <HI>Robert Cecill</HI> Earl of <HI>Salisbury</HI> ray&s;ed a large and &s;tately Hou&s;e of Brick and Timber; <HI>Worcefler</HI> Hou&s;e lies &s;ideling of it, and there being a great <HI>VValnut</HI> tree there growing, which much hindred the pro&s;pect of <HI>Salisbury</HI> Hou&s;e Ea&s;tward, the Earl bargai|ned with one of the Lord <HI>Edward</HI> of <HI>VVorce&s;ters</HI> &s;ervants, that if he could get leave of his Lord to cut down that Tree, he would give him 100 <HI>li.</HI> the &s;ervant told his Lord of it, who bad him fell down the Tree and take the money; but the old Earl (there being no good corre&s;pondence 'twixt <HI>Salisbury</HI> and him) cau&s;ed pre&s;ently a new Brick building to be there erected, where the Tree &s;tood.</P>
<P>We come now to <HI>Durham</HI> Hou&s;e, built by <HI>Thomas Hatfield</HI> Bi&s;hop of that <HI>See,</HI> a very capacious Edifice, on the North &s;ide whereof &s;tood a row of thatch'd Stables, which the Earl of <HI>Salisbury</HI> purcha&s;ed, and pull'd down, and erected in place thereof, the <HI>New Exchange,</HI> or <HI>Britains Bur&s;e;</HI> which was built with wonderful celerity, for the fir&s;t Stone thereof was layed on the tenth of <HI>June</HI> 1608, and it was fully fini&s;hed the <HI>November</HI> next following. The Earl did then invite King <HI>James</HI> with the Queen, to &s;ee his new Hou&s;e, where after a rich banquet the King named the place <HI>Britains Bur&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Next beyond <HI>Durham</HI> Hou&s;e and this new building, is another great Palace, belonging of old to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Norwich,</HI> but afterwards it came to the Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Yorke,</HI> by this occa&s;ion. When Cardinal <HI>Wool&s;ey,</HI> Arch Bi&s;hop of <HI>Yorke,</HI> was Indicted in a <HI>premunire,</HI> whereby the King was entitled to all his Goods and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, he among other things, &s;eazed upon the &s;aid Cardinals Hou&s;e, where he then dwelled, commonly called <HI>York Place,</HI> and changed the name thereof to <HI>White-Hall.</HI></P>
<P>The Arch-bi&s;hops of <HI>York,</HI> having then no Hou&s;e in <HI>London</HI> or <HI>Westmin&s;ter,</HI> Queen <HI>Mary</HI> gave unto <HI>Nicholas Heath</HI> then Arch-bi&s;hop of <HI>Yorke, Suffolke</HI> Hou&s;e in <HI>Southwark,</HI> lately built by <HI>Charles Brandon;</HI> which Hou&s;e the &s;aid Arch-bi&s;hop &s;old, and in lieu thereof he purcha&s;ed the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Norwich's</HI> Hou&s;e, which ever &s;ince hath been called <HI>Yorke</HI> Hou&s;e, though it came after|wards to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Duke of Buckingham <HI>George Villers,</HI> who added much to the old Edifice, and would have had it called <HI>Buckingham</HI> Hou&s;e, which name is engraven upon the watergate in great Letters.</P>
<P>There was of old, an Ho&s;pitall of St. <HI>Mary Rouncival</HI> (an order which came from <HI>Navarre</HI> in <HI>Spain)</HI> by <HI>Charing-Cro&s;&s;e,</HI> where a Fraternity was founded in the fifteenth of <HI>Edward</HI> the fourth, which was afterwards &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and tur|ned to Tenements. Near unto this Ho&s;pital was an <HI>Hermitage</HI> with a Chap|pel of St. <HI>Katherine</HI> over again&s;t <HI>Charing-Cro&s;&s;e,</HI> which Cro&s;&s;e was erected by <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t to the honor of his Queen (as is &s;poken el&s;e-where) <HI>Eleanor,</HI> and
<PB N="350" REF="95">
it was a goodly Monument, which was utterly de&s;troyed by the fury of the <HI>long Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>We&s;t of this Cro&s;&s;e &s;tood &s;ometimes another Ho&s;pital called St. <HI>James,</HI> con|&s;i&s;ting of two Hides of Land in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Margaret</HI> in <HI>VVe&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and founded by the Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> for 14 Si&s;ter-Maidens that were Leprous; then were there added eight Brethren to mini&s;ter Divine Service there. After|wards, there was a great addition of Land made to this Ho&s;pital, and <HI>Edward</HI> the fir&s;t granted a Fair to be kept there every year.</P>
<P>This Ho&s;pital being &s;urrendred to <HI>Henry</HI> 8. the Si&s;ters were allowed Pen&s;i|ons during their lives, and the King erected there a Mannor Hou&s;e, with a Park annexed, encompa&s;&s;ed about with a Brick Wall. But before we advance fur|ther Northward towards <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> we mu&s;t make a &s;tep backward to Saint <HI>Martins</HI> Church and Lane, where on the We&s;t &s;ide there are many gentile fair Hou&s;es in a row built by the &s;ame Earl of <HI>Salisbury</HI> who built <HI>Britains Bur&s;e,</HI> but &s;omewhat before.

<P>On the left hand of <HI>Charing-Cro&s;&s;e,</HI> there are divers fair Hou&s;es built of late years, &s;pecially the mo&s;t &s;tately Palace of <HI>Suffolk</HI> or <HI>Northampton Hou&s;e,</HI> built by <HI>Henry</HI> of <HI>Northampton</HI> Son to the Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and Lord Privie Seal to King <HI>James.</HI> Then is there a large plot of ground enclo&s;ed with Brick, called <HI>Scotland</HI> yard, where the Kings of <HI>Scotland</HI> were u&s;ed to be lodg'd, and <HI>Margaret</HI> Queen Dowager of <HI>Scotland,</HI> elde&s;t &s;i&s;ter to <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>8th,</HI> kept her Court there after the King her Husband had been kill'd in <HI>Flodden</HI> field.</P>

<HEAD>Of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> Abbey.</HEAD>
<P>THis Church is famous, e&s;pecially by rea&s;on of the <HI>in auguration</HI> and <HI>&s;e|pulture</HI> of the Kings of <HI>England. Sulvard</HI> writeth, that there &s;tood &s;ometimes a Temple of <HI>Apollo</HI> in that place, and that in the daies of <HI>Antoninus Pius,</HI> Emperor of <HI>Rome,</HI> it fell down with an Earth|quake; out of the remains whereof, <HI>Sebert</HI> King of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Saxons,</HI> erected ano|ther to St. <HI>Peter,</HI> which being by the <HI>Danes</HI> overthrown, Bi&s;hop <HI>Dun&s;tane</HI> re-e|dified, and granted it to &s;ome few Monks. But afterwards King <HI>Edward</HI> &s;urna|med the <HI>Confe&s;&s;our,</HI> with the tenth penny of all his Revenues, built it a new for to be his own Sepulture, and a Mona&s;tery for <HI>Benedictine</HI> Monks, endowing it with Livings and Lands, lying di&s;per&s;ed in divers parts of <HI>England.</HI> But li&s;ten what an Hi&s;torian &s;aith, who then lived. <Q>The devour King de&s;tined unto God that place, both for that it was near unto the famous and wealthy City of <HI>London,</HI> and al&s;o had a plea&s;ant &s;cituation among&s;t fruitful fields, and green grounds, lying round about it, with the principal River running hard by, bringing in from all parts of the World, great variety of Wares; and Merchan|dize of all &s;orts to the City adjoyning; But chiefly for the love of the <HI>Chief Apo&s;tle,</HI> whom he reverenced with a &s;pecial and &s;ingular affection. He made choice to have a place there for his own Sepulchre: and thereupon comman|ded, that of the Tenths of all his Rents, the work of a noble Edifice &s;hould be taken in hand, &s;uch as might be&s;eem the <HI>Prince</HI> of the Apo&s;tles: To the end (as the <HI>Annales</HI> have it) that he might procure the propitious favour of the Lord, after he &s;hould fini&s;h the cour&s;e of this tran&s;itory life, both in regard of his de|vout Piety, and al&s;o of his free Oblation of Lands and Ornaments, wherewith he purpo&s;ed to endow, and enrich the &s;ame. According therefore to the Kings
<PB N="354" REF="96">
commandement the work was nobly began, and happily proceeded forward: neither the charges already disbur&s;ed, or to be disbur&s;ed, were weighed and regarded, &s;o that it might be pre&s;ented in the end unto God and Saint <HI>Peter,</HI> and made worth their acceptation.</Q> Thus the words of the old Record run.</P>
<P>Touching the Form of that ancient building, we read in an old Manu&s;cript Book, that the principal plot or ground-work of the building was &s;upported with mo&s;t lofty Arches, ca&s;t round with a four &s;quare work, and &s;emblable joynts. But the compa&s;&s;e of the whole, with a double Arch of Stone on both &s;ides is enclo&s;ed with joyned-work, firmly knit and united together every way. Moreouer, the Cro&s;&s;e of the Church which was to compa&s;&s;e the mid Quire of tho&s;e that chaunted unto the Lord, and with a twofold &s;upportance, that it had on either &s;ide to uphold and bear the lofty top of the Tower in the mid&s;t, &s;im|ply ri&s;eth at fir&s;t with a low and &s;trong Arch; then mounteth it higher, with many winding &s;tairs, artificially a&s;cending with a number of &s;teps: But after|ward with a &s;ingle Wall it reacheth up to the roof of Timber, well and &s;urely covered with Lead. But after an hundred and three&s;core years, King <HI>Henry</HI> the third, &s;ubverted this Fabrick of King <HI>Edwards,</HI> and built from the very founda|tion a new Church of very rare Workman&s;hip, &s;upported with &s;undry rowes of Marble Pillars, and the roofe covered over with &s;heets of Lead: a piece of work that co&s;t fifty years labour in building; which Church the <HI>Abbots</HI> enlarged very much toward the We&s;t end; and King <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;eventh for the burial of him|&s;elf and his Children, adjoyned thereto, in the Ea&s;t end, a Chappel of admira|ble artificial elegancy, The Wonder of the Worlde, as <HI>Leland</HI> calleth it: for a man would &s;ay, that all the curious and exqui&s;ite work that can be devi&s;ed, is there compacted; wherein is to be &s;een, his own mo&s;t &s;tately magnifical Mo|nument, all of &s;olid and ma&s;&s;ie Copper.</P>
<P>This Church, when the Monks were driven thence, from time to time, was altered to and fro with &s;undry changes. Fir&s;t of all, it had a <HI>Dean</HI> and <HI>Prebonda|ries:</HI> &s;oon after one <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> and no more, namely <HI>T. Thurlbey,</HI> who having wa|&s;ted the Church Patrimony, &s;urrendred it to the &s;poil of Countiers; and &s;hort|ly after, were the Monks with their Abbot &s;et in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again by Queen <HI>Mary;</HI> and when they al&s;o within a while after, were by authority of Parliament ca&s;t out, Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> converted it into a <HI>Collegiate</HI> Church, or rather into a Seminary and Nur&s;e-Garden of the Church, appointing twelve Prebendaries there, and as many old Souldiers pa&s;t &s;ervice, for Alms-men, fourty Schollars, who in their due time are preferred to the Univer&s;ities; and from thence &s;ent forth into the Church and Common-weale, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Over the&s;e they placed D. <HI>Bill</HI> Dean, who&s;e Succe&s;&s;or was <HI>Gabriel Goodman,</HI> a right good man indeed, and of &s;ingular integrity and an e&s;pecial Patron of Literature.</P>

And therefore I grant to every each of them, in as much as my Terre&s;trial power may &s;uffice, all man|ner of freedom of joyous liberty; and who&s;oever &s;hall pre&s;ume, or doth contrary to this my grant, I will, he lo&s;e his name, VVor&s;hip, Dignity and Power; and that with the great Traytor</HI> Judas, <HI>that betrayed our Saviour, he be in the everla&s;ting fire of Hell.

<P>The Clergy al&s;o, which make a con&s;iderable part of the Common-wealth, were u&s;ed to have their Repre&s;entatives there, not only in the per&s;ons of the Bi&s;hops (which at the fir&s;t con&s;titution, were the prime Parliament, and con|tinued &s;o many Ages) but in the Convocation which was an A&s;&s;embly of Di|vines, fairly cho&s;en to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor is this Soveraign &s;uper-intendent Councel an Epitome of this Iland only; but it may be &s;aid, to repre&s;ent the whole Univer&s;e, according to the primitive con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The <HI>Soveraign Prince</HI> was as the <HI>Sun,</HI> the <HI>Nobles</HI> the fixed <HI>Starres,</HI> the Itine|rant <HI>Judges,</HI> and other Officers, that were wont to go with Me&s;&s;ages 'twixt both Hou&s;es, to the <HI>Planets:</HI> The <HI>Clergy</HI> (when there was a Convocation Hou&s;e, as was &s;aid before) to the <HI>Element</HI> of fire: The <HI>Commons</HI> to the &s;olid body of the <HI>Earth,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Elements.</P>
<P>He who hath bin conver&s;ant with the Chronicles of this Iland, will finde it hath bin her fate, to be four times conquered; but the <HI>Scot,</HI> never till now of late. The&s;e &s;o many Conque&s;ts, mu&s;t needs bring with them, many tumblings and to&s;&s;ings, many di&s;turbances and changes in Government; yet I have ob|&s;erved, that notwith&s;tanding the&s;e various tumblings, <HI>England</HI> retained &s;till the form of <HI>Monarchy,</HI> and &s;omething there was alwayes, that held an Analogy with the great A&s;&s;embly of Parliament.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Conque&s;t was made by <HI>Claudius Cae&s;ar,</HI> at which time it may be &s;aid, that the <HI>Standard</HI> of the Cro&s;&s;e came in together with the Roman Eagles; 'tis well known, how the Roman governed. He had his <HI>Comitia,</HI> which bore a
<PB N="357" REF="98">
re&s;emblance with our Convention in Parliament, the place of meeting was call|ed <HI>praetorium,</HI> and the Lawes which were enacted, were called <HI>Plebi&s;cita.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Saxon</HI> Conque&s;t &s;ucceeded next, in which were the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and the <HI>Sax|ons</HI> governed by Parliament, though it was under other names, as <HI>Michel Ge|mote, Michel Sinoth,</HI> and <HI>VVitenage Mote.</HI> There are Records near upon a thou|&s;and years, of the&s;e Parliaments, in the Raigns of King <HI>Ina, O&s;fa, Ethelbert,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>The third Conque&s;t was by the <HI>Danes,</HI> and they governed al&s;o by &s;uch gene|rall A&s;&s;emblies, in the Raign of <HI>Canutus</HI> and others.</P>
<P>Then came the <HI>Norman,</HI> who&s;e Succe&s;&s;ors did revive, and ratifie the way of governing by Parliament, witne&s;s <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> which was u&s;ed to be call|ed the Foundation of the Engli&s;h liberty; and it may be compared to divers outlandi&s;h graffs &s;et upon one &s;tock: for the choy&s;e&s;t of the <HI>Briti&s;h, Roman, Saxon, Dani&s;h,</HI> and <HI>Norman</HI> Lawes, being cull'd and pick'd out, and gathered as it were in one bundle, out of them the fore&s;aid grand <HI>Charter</HI> was extracted: the e&s;tabli&s;hment whereof, was a work of a Parliament: Now by an ancient Sta|tute of <HI>Edward</HI> the third, it was enacted, That all Statutes are repealed, which are again&s;t <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> or <HI>Charta de fore&s;ta.</HI></P>
<P>Nor are the Lawes of this Iland only, and the immunities of the people con|&s;erved by Parliament; but all the be&s;t policed Countries of <HI>Europe</HI> have the like. The <HI>Germans</HI> have their <HI>Diets:</HI> The <HI>Dane</HI> and <HI>Swedes</HI> their <HI>Rich-daghs.</HI> The <HI>Spaniard, las Cortes;</HI> and the <HI>French,</HI> the <HI>A&s;&s;embly of the three E&s;tates,</HI> though it hath bin for many years di&s;continued.</P>
<P>And touching <HI>England,</HI> the Parliament was u&s;ed to be the principal Foun|tain, whence the Soveraign Prince derived his happine&s;s and &s;afety. It was the great Conduit-Pipe, which conveighed unto him the Peoples bounty and love. It was the true&s;t Looking-Gla&s;&s;e, wherein he di&s;cerned their affections and al|legiance.</P>
<P>In Parliament, the Soveraign Prince u&s;ed to appear, like the Sun in the <HI>Me|ridian,</HI> in the altitude of his glory, in his highe&s;t <HI>Royal State,</HI> as the Law tells us.</P>
<P>But we will go now more particularly to work, and treat of this great <HI>Nati|onal Conncel,</HI> according to the fir&s;t con&s;titution, and e&s;tabli&s;hment thereof.</P>
<P>This Court con&s;i&s;teth of the Kings Maje&s;ty &s;itting there, as in his Royal po|litick Capacity, and of the three E&s;tates of the Realm, <HI>viz.</HI> of the Lords <HI>&s;piritual Arch Bi&s;hops</HI> and Bi&s;hops, being in number twenty four, who &s;it there by &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion in re&s;pect of their Counties, or Baronies parcel of their Bi&s;hopricks, which they hold al&s;o in their <HI>politick</HI> Capacity; And every one of the&s;e, when any Parliament is to be holden, ought, <HI>Ex debito ju&s;titiae,</HI> to have a writ of Summons. The Lords <HI>Temporal</HI> Dukes, Marque&s;&s;es, Earls, Vi&s;counts, and Ba|rons, who &s;it there, by rea&s;on of their Dignities, which they hold by De&s;cent or Creation; and likewi&s;e, every one of the&s;e being of full age, ought to have a writ of Summons, <HI>ex debito ju&s;titiae;</HI> for they are called <HI>Parliamentary Barons.</HI> The third E&s;tate is the <HI>Commons</HI> of the Realm, whereof there be Knights of &s;hires, or Counties, Citizens of Cities, and Burghe&s;&s;es of Burghes. All which are re&s;pectively elected by the Shires or Counties, Cities and Burghes, by force of the Kings Writ, <HI>Ex debito ju&s;titiae,</HI> and none of them ought to be omitted; and the&s;e repre&s;ent all the Commons of the whole Realm, and tru&s;ted for them, and were u&s;ed to be in number, near upon 500.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>King</HI> and the&s;e three E&s;tates, were the great Corporation or Body politick of the Kingdom; but they were to &s;it in two Hou&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> the King and Lords in one Hou&s;e, called the Lords Hou&s;e, and the Knights, Citizens and Burge&s;&s;es in another Hou&s;e, called the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="99">
The Commons are in Legal under&s;tanding, taken for the Franck Tenants, or Freeholders of the Counties. And who&s;oever is not a Lord of Parliament, and of the Lords Hou&s;e, is of the Hou&s;e of the Commons, either in per&s;on, or by repre&s;entation, partly coaugmentative, and partly repre&s;entative.</P>
<P>Of this Court of Parliament, the Soveraign Prince by the Law is <HI>Caput prin|cipium &amp; finis,</HI> the head, beginning, and ending. And as in the natural body, when all the &s;inews, being joyned in the head, do unite their forces together, for the &s;trengthening of the body, there is <HI>ultimum potentiae;</HI> &s;o, in the politique Body, when the King and the Lords &s;piritual, and temporal, Knights, Citizens, and Burge&s;&s;es, are all by the Kings Command a&s;&s;embled and joyned together, under the Head in con&s;ultation for the common good of the whole Realm, there is <HI>ultimum &s;apientiae.</HI></P>
<P>The third year of <HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth, it appears in a Parliament Roll, that the Parliament being called, as hath bin &s;aid, <HI>Commune Con&s;ilium,</HI> every member of the Hou&s;e being a Coun&s;ellor, &s;hould have the three properties of the <HI>Elephant;</HI> which are Fir&s;t, That he hath no Gall.</P>
<P>Secondly, That he be inflexible, and cannot bow.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That he is of a mo&s;t ripe and perfect memory; which properties, as there it is &s;aid, ought to be in every Member of the great Councel of Parli|ament.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, to be without Gall, that is, without malice, rancor, hear, and envie, In the Elephant, <HI>Melancholiae tran&s;it in nutrimentum corporis,</HI> every galli&s;h in|clination (if any were) &s;hould tend to the good of the whole body, the Com|mon-wealth.</P>
<P>Secondly, That he be con&s;tant, inflexible, and not to be bowed, or turned from the right, either for fear, reward, or favour; nor, in judgement, re&s;pect any per&s;on.</P>
<P>Thirdly, of a ripe memory, that they remembring perils pa&s;t, might pre|vent dangers to come, as in that Roll of Parliament it appeareth.</P>
<P>The Prince <HI>de advi&s;amento con&s;ilii</HI> (for &s;o be the words of the Writ of Parlia|ment) re&s;olving to have a Parliament, doth out of the Court of <HI>Chancery,</HI> &s;end out Writs of Summons, at the lea&s;t forty dayes before the Parliament begins: every Lord of Parliament, either &s;piritual, as Arch bi&s;hops, and Bi&s;hops; or tem|poral, as Dukes, Marqui&s;&s;es, Earls, Vi&s;counts, and Barons, Peers of the Realm, and Lords of Parliament, were u&s;ed to have &s;everal Writs of Summons.</P>
<P>And all the Judges of the Realm, Barons of the Exchequer of the Coif, the Kings learned Cou&s;nel, and the Civilians Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Chancery,</HI> are called to give their a&s;&s;i&s;tance and attendance, in the upper Hou&s;e of Parliament; but they have no <HI>Voices</HI> in Parliament, being only mini&s;terial; and their Writs differ from the Writs to the Judges; for their Writs be, <HI>Qu&oacute;d inter&s;itis Nobi&s;|cum &amp; cum caeteris de Concilio No&s;tro,</HI> (&amp; &s;ometimes <HI>Nobi&s;cum</HI> only) <HI>&s;uper prae|mi&s;&s;is tractaturi, ve&s;trumque con&s;ilium impen&s;uri;</HI> But the Writ to the Barons is, <HI>Qu&oacute;d inter&s;itis cum praelatis, Magnatibus &amp; proceribus, &s;uper dictis negotiis trac|taturi, ve&s;trumque Con&s;ilium impen&s;uri.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, in every Writ of Summons to the Bi&s;hops, there is a clau&s;e re|quiring them to &s;ummon the&s;e per&s;ons to appear per&s;onally at the Parliament, which is in the&s;e words, <HI>premonientes Decanum &amp; Capitulum Eccle&s;iae ve&s;trae Nor|wicen&s;is, ac Archidiaconos totumque clerum ve&s;trae Dioces, quod iidem Decani &amp; Archi diaconi in propriis per&s;onis &s;uis, ac dictum capitulum per unum, idem&abque; cle|rus per duos procuratores idoneos plenam &amp; &s;ufficientem pote&s;tatem ab ip&s;is capitulo &amp; clero divi&s;im habentes predict' die &amp; loco per&s;onaliter inter&s;int ad con&s;entiendum hiis quae tunc ibidem de Communi concilio dicti regni No&s;tri divina favente clemen|tia contigerit ordinari;</HI> and the Bi&s;hop under his Seal makes Certificate accor|dingly.</P>
<P><PB N="359" REF="99">
And the&s;e are called <HI>Procuratores cleri,</HI> and many times have appeared in Parliament, as &s;piritual A&s;&s;i&s;tants, to con&s;ider, con&s;ult, and con&s;ent, <HI>ut &s;upra;</HI> but had never voyces there, becau&s;e they were no Lords of Parliament; And this A&s;&s;embly was called the <HI>Convocation-Hou&s;e,</HI> which the la&s;t King continu|ing, (after the di&s;&s;olution of the Parliament) and the Bi&s;hops comming a|mong&s;t them to con&s;ult, and make <HI>Canons,</HI> the next Parliament prote&s;ted a|gain&s;t their proceedings as irregular, and prejudicial to the priviledges of Par|liament.</P>
<P>Ob&s;ervable it is, what difference there was in the Writ, whereby the &s;piri|tual Lords were &s;ummoned, and that whereby the temporal Lords were called. The <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> Barons were required by the Kings Writ to be pre&s;ent, <HI>In fide &amp; dilectione quibus nobis tenemini,</HI> In the faith and <HI>love</HI> you are bound to us; But the &s;ecular Lords were &s;ummoned to appear, <HI>In fide &amp; homagio, quibus nobis tenemini.</HI> In the faith and <HI>homage</HI> you are bound unto us; Now touching the Commons, their Writ or Summons to the Sheriff runs thus.</P>

<P>This Commi&s;&s;ion or Writ, is the foundation, whereon the whole fabrick of the power, and duty of both Hou&s;es of Parliament is grounded.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Hou&s;e is to parley, or have conference, and to treat and con&s;ult with the King, the other Hou&s;e is to do and con&s;ent only unto what the other &s;hall ordain.</P>
<P>This was the Law and u&s;age in former times; but what is the power of the Commons in the&s;e dayes now that the Government is altred, and ca&s;t into another mould, (the Hou&s;e of Peers being di&s;&s;olved) it is not the intent of this Di&s;cour&s;e to determine.</P>
<P>At the return of the Writs afore&s;aid, the Parliament could not begin, but by the Royal pre&s;ence of the King, either in Per&s;on, or by Repre&s;entation: By Repre&s;entation two wayes, either by a <HI>Gardian</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> by Letters Patents under the Great Seal, when the King was <HI>in remotis,</HI> out of the Realm; or by <HI>Commi&s;&s;ion,</HI> under the Great Seal, to certain Lords of Parliament, repre&s;enting the Per&s;on of the King, he being within the Realm, but ab&s;ent in re&s;pect of &s;ome infirmity.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t day of the Parliament, the King him&s;elf, or mo&s;t commonly, the Lord Chancellor, or Keeper, in the pre&s;ence of the Lords and Commons, did &s;hew the cau&s;es of the calling of his High Court of Parliament; but the King might have appointed any other to be his Prolocutor, in this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Then the Commons are to choo&s;e their Speaker; but in regard, that after their choyce, the King might refu&s;e him; for avoiding of time and conte&s;tation, the u&s;e was as in the <HI>Conge de&s;lire</HI> of a Bi&s;hop, that the King doth recom|mend a di&s;creet and learned man, whom the Commons elect; but without their Election, no <HI>Speaker</HI> can be appointed for them, becau&s;e he is their mouth, and intru&s;ted by them, and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that the Hou&s;e of Commons cannot &s;it without him: therefore a grievous &s;ickne&s;s is a good cau&s;e to remove him, as in <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>4th</HI> Raign, <HI>John Chervy</HI> Speaker, was for &s;ickne&s;s di&s;charged, and Sir <HI>John Dorewoold</HI> cho&s;en in his place; but &s;ickne&s;s is no cau&s;e to remove any Knight, Citizen, or Burge&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>The <HI>Speaker</HI> being voted in the Hou&s;e, was pre&s;ented to the King, where be|ing allowed, he made a &s;upplication, con&s;i&s;ting of three parts.</P>

<ITEM>Fir&s;t, That the Commons in Parliament might have free &s;peech.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, That in any thing he &s;hould deliver in the name of the Commons, if he &s;hould commit any error, no fault &s;hould be imputed to the Com|mons.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly, That as often as nece&s;&s;ity for his Maje&s;ties &s;ervice, and the good of the Common-wealth &s;hall require, he may by the directions of the Hou&s;e, have acce&s;s to his Royal Per&s;on.</ITEM>

<P>Any of the Peers, by the Kings leave, may ab&s;ent him&s;elf, and make a proxy to another Lord; but a Knight, Citizen, or Burge&s;s, cannot make a <HI>Proxy,</HI> be|cau&s;e he is elected, and intru&s;ted by multitudes of people. And it is to be ob|&s;erved, though one be cho&s;en for one particular County or City, yet when he is returned, and &s;its in Parliament, he &s;erveth for the whole Common-wealth.</P>

<P>There have been for a long time, and &s;till there are great Complaints for mul|tiplicity of Suits in Law, and it were a whol&s;ome and happy thing, could it be prevented: but becau&s;e a Di&s;ea&s;e cannot be cured without knowledge of the Cau&s;e, it is to be ob&s;erved, that there be &s;ix Cau&s;es of the increa&s;e of them, whereof two be general, the other four particular; The general be Peace, and Plenty; The particular, 1. The di&s;&s;olution of &s;o many Mona&s;teries, Chante|ries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the di&s;per&s;ing of them into &s;o many &s;everal hands. 2. The &s;warm of Informers. 3. The number of Concealors. 4. The multiude of At|turneys.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t general; In the Reign of <HI>E. 3. R. 2. H. 4.

Peace is the Mo|ther of Plenty, (which is the <HI>2d</HI> general cau&s;e) and Plenty the Nur&s;e of Suits. In particulars, by the di&s;&s;olution of Mona&s;teries, Chanteries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and di&s;per&s;ing of them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon the Statutes made concerning the &s;ame (there being &s;uch a confluence of Eccle&s;ia&s;tical po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions) there aro&s;e many que&s;tions, and doubts, whereupon Suits were greatly increa&s;ed. 2. Informers and Relators rai&s;ed ma|ny Suits, by Informations, Writs, &amp;c. in the Kings Courts at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> up|on penal Statutes, many whereof were <HI>ob&s;olete,</HI> inconvenient, and not fit for tho&s;e daies, and yet remained as &s;nares upon the Subject, &s;o as the Subject might ju&s;tly &s;ay with <HI>Tacitus, Pri&ugrave;s vitiis laboravimus, nunc legibus.</HI> 3. Concealers; <HI>Helluones</HI> that endeavoured to &s;wallow up Cathedral Churches, and the Eccle|&s;ia&s;tical po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Church-men, and the Livings of many others of the Kings Subjects. La&s;tly, the multitude of Atturneys, more than is limited by Law, is a great cau&s;e of encrea&s;e of Suits.</P>
<P>Touching the jurisdiction of this Court, which was u&s;ed to be called the <HI>Kings Bench,</HI> it is of a larger extent of power, and more incontroulable than any other Tribunal: for the Law pre&s;ums, that the King is there &s;till in Per&s;on.

<P>In the Chancery are two Courts, one ordinary, <HI>Coram Domino Rege in Cancel|laria,</HI> wherein the Lord Chancelor, or Lord Keeper of the Great Seal proceeds, according to the right line of the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, <HI>Secundum legem &amp; con&s;uetudinem Angliae;</HI> Another extraordinary according to the Rule of equity, <HI>&s;ecundum aequum &amp; bonum;</HI> And fir&s;t of the former Court.</P>

The &s;tyle of the Court of the Kings Bench is <HI>Coram Rege,</HI> (as hath been &s;aid) and the &s;tyle of this Court of Chancery is <HI>Coram domino Rege in Cancellaria,</HI> and <HI>Additio probat minoritatem;</HI> And in this Court, the Lord Chancelor or the Lord Keeper is the &s;ole Judge, and in the Kings Bench there are four Judges at the lea&s;t.</P>

<P>And this Court is the rather alwaies open, for that if a man be wrongfully impri&s;oned in the Vacation, the Lord Chancellor may grant a <HI>Habeas Corpus,</HI> and do him Ju&s;tice according to Law, where neither the <HI>Kings Bench</HI> nor <HI>Com|mon Pleas,</HI> can grant that Writ, but in the term time; but this Court may grant it either in Term time or Vacation: &s;o likewi&s;e this Court may grant Prohibi|tions at any time, either in Term or Vacation: which Writs of Prohibition are not retornable, but if they be not obeyed, then may this Court grant an <HI>At|tachment,</HI> upon the Prohibition retornable, either in the Kings Bench or Common Place.</P>
<P>The Officers and Mini&s;ters of this Court of Common Law do principally at|tend, and do their &s;ervice to the Great Seal, as the twelve Ma&s;ters of the Chan|cery, whereof the Ma&s;ter of the Rolls is the chief, who by their original in&s;titu|tion, as it is proved before, &s;hould be expert in the Common Law, to &s;ee the forming and framing of original Writs, according to Law, which are not of cour&s;e; whereupon &s;uch are called in our ancient Authors, <HI>Brevia Magi&s;tralia;</HI> Then you have the <HI>Clerk of the Crown,</HI> the <HI>Clerk of the Hamper,</HI> the <HI>Sealer,</HI> the <HI>Chafe wax,</HI> the <HI>Controuler</HI> of the Chancery, twenty four <HI>Cur&s;itors</HI> for making Writs of cour&s;e, or form'd Writs according to the Regi&s;ter of the Chancery; The <HI>Clerk</HI> of the <HI>pre&s;entations,</HI> the <HI>Clerk</HI> of the <HI>Faculties,</HI> the <HI>Clerk Examiner</HI> of the Patents, the Clerks of the <HI>Petty-bag,</HI> and the <HI>&s;ix Attorneys.</HI></P>

Yet this Court of Equity proceeding by Engli&s;h Bill, is no Court of Record; therefore it can bind but the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> only, and neither the <HI>State</HI> of the Defendants Lands, nor property of his <HI>Goods,</HI> and Chattles; therefore if the Lord Chancelor impo&s;e any fine, it is void in Law, he having no power but on the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> only.</P>
<P>Yet the Lord Chancelor or Keeper, is &s;ole Judge both in this Court of Equi|ty, and in the Court concerning the Common Law; but in ca&s;es of weight or difficulty, he doth a&s;&s;i&s;t him&s;elf with &s;ome of the Judges: and no greater excep|tion can be taken hereunto, than in ca&s;e of the Lord <HI>Steward</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> being &s;ole Judge in tryal of the Nobility, who al&s;o is a&s;&s;i&s;ted with &s;ome of the Judges.</P>
<P>Touching this Court of Equity, the ancient Rule is, that three things are to be con&s;idered in a Court of Con&s;cience; <HI>Covin, Accident, and Breach of confi|dence;</HI> All Covins, collu&s;ions, frauds, and deceits, for which ther's no remedy by the ordinary cour&s;e of Law. <HI>Accident,</HI> as when the &s;ervant of an Obligo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter"> or

<P>The prime Officer of this Court, as was mentioned before, is the Lord high <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> who receives a <HI>White Staff</HI> from the King; But in former time he had this Office by delivery of a <HI>Golden Key.</HI> Then there is <HI>Cancellarius Scaccarii</HI> the Chancelor of the Exchequer, who keepeth the Seal: Then you have the chief <HI>Baron,</HI> and his A&s;&s;ociates, whereof one, though he &s;its there, yet he hath no voice; therefore he was u&s;ed to be call'd by way of Drol|lery, <HI>Baron Tell-clock,</HI> yet he takes the &s;ame Oath that others do, he hath a Fee of 100 Marks <HI>per annum,</HI> At daies of <HI>prefixions,</HI> he hath to do with the Sheriffs Accounts, he can take Recognizances; but he hath not the Robes, nor any &s;uffrage upon the Bench in point of Judicature; And that nickname Baron <HI>Tellclock</HI> came up fir&s;t in Baron <HI>Southertons</HI> time, who when he felt the Chimes ring in his Stomach towards dinner, he was us'd to tell chief Baron <HI>Tanfield, My Lord'tis twelve a clock.</HI></P>

Now, it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that albeit the <HI>Barons</HI> are the &s;ole Judges of the Exchequer Court, yet the Lord Trea&s;urer is joyn'd with them, in keeping of the Records. The Lord Trea&s;urer hath al&s;o granted him by Patent under the great Seal, <HI>The&s;aurarium Scaccarii Regis Angliae,</HI> which of ancient time, as the Lord <HI>Coke</HI> hath it, was a di&s;tinct Office by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Then is there the <HI>Pipe Office,</HI> whereof the Chancelor of the Exchequer is <HI>Contrarotulator</HI> or Cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="apex" EXTENT="1 letter">ouler. The Original in&s;titution of the <HI>Pipe Office</HI> was taken from a Conduit of water, which was conveyed by Pipes into a Ce&s;tern which lay in a Court: or as water is derived from many Fountains Springs, by Aquaeducts into a Ce&s;tern Hou&s;e, and from thence into &s;everal Offices of the &s;ame: &s;o this golden and &s;ilver &s;tream is drawn from &s;undry Courts as Foun|tains of Ju&s;tice, and other Springs of Revenue reduc'd and collected into one Pipe, and thereby conveyed into the Grand Ce&s;tern of the Princes receit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Therefore, all Accounts and Debts to the Crown, are delivered and collected out of the Offices of the Kings <HI>Remembrancer,</HI> and Trea&s;urers Remembrancer, and &s;o drawn, and put in charge in the Pipe. There be five Auditors of the Reve|nue Royal within the &s;urvey of this Court, and their Office is, to take Accounts of the Kings Receivers, Sheriffs, E&s;cheators, Collectors, and Cu&s;tomers, and to audite and perfect the Account; But an Auditor cannot allow any Licence or Grant, in regard he knoweth not whether it be good this belongs to the Barons; Neither can the Auditor put any thing in Charge, his Office being only to take and audite Accounts.

Secondly, he is a Remembrancer, for he gives the Lord Trea&s;urer a certificate of the money received the week before. Then he is an Auditor, for he makes Debenturs to every Teller, before they pay any money, and takes and audites their Accounts. Be&s;ides all this, he keepeth the black Book of Receits, and the Lord Trea&s;urers Key of the Trea&s;ury, and &s;eeth every Tellers money lock'd up in the new Trea&s;ury.

<P>In the Exchequer Chamber, all ca&s;es of difficulty, either in the Kings bench, or the Common Pleas, were u&s;ed to be debated, argued, and re&s;olved by all the Judges of <HI>England,</HI> and the Exchequer <HI>Barons.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Trea&s;urer</HI> of the Kings Chamber, and the Keeper of the privy pur&s;e, with &s;uch dome&s;tick Offices of the Kings Hou&s;e, are not &s;ubject to this Court of Exchequer.</P>
<P>This Court was fir&s;t erected for the particular profit and &s;ervice of the Sove|raign Prince; And this profit is mediat or immediat; Immediat, as of Lands,

Rents, Franchi&s;es, Hereditaments, Debts, Duties, Accounts, Goods, Chattels, and other profits, and benefits what&s;oever due unto the Soveraign Prince.

<P>There is a Court called the Court of Equity in the Exchequer Chamber. The Judges of this Court are the Lord Trea&s;urer, the Chancelor of the Exchequer, and the Barons; Their juri&s;diction is as large for matter of Equity, as the Ba|rons of the Exchequer have for the benefit of the King by the common Law, but if in either Court they hold any Plea that doth not concern the profit of the King, there lieth a Prohibition.</P>
<P>To conclude, there are &s;even Courts that belong to the Exchequer. 1. The Court of Pleas or of the Barons. 2. The Court of Accounts. 3. The Court of Receits. 4. The Court of the Exchequer Chamber, being the A&s;&s;embly of all the <HI>Judges</HI> of <HI>England</HI> for matters in Law. 5. The Court of Exchequer for Errors in the Court of Exchequer. 6.

<HEAD>OF THE COURT <HI>OF</HI> ADMIRALTY.</HEAD>
<P>HAving thus made &s;ome in&s;pections into &s;o many Courts, we mu&s;t not pretermit the <HI>Court of Admiralty;</HI> for <HI>Great Britain</HI> being an I&s;land which makes the Sea, and Woodden Ca&s;tles, to be her chiefe&s;t Con&s;ervators: the Court of <HI>Admiralty</HI> may be &s;aid to be more pertinent and nece&s;&s;ary to her, then to divers other States: therefore the Lord High Admiral is by the Law of <HI>England,</HI> one of the four Officers of the Crown, with the Lord Chancelor, the Lord Trea&s;urer, and Lord privy Seal. Some hold the Etymology of <HI>Admirall,</HI> to come from the Greek word <GAP DESC="foreign">, which &s;ignifieth <HI>Sal&s;ugomaris,</HI> the &s;altne&s;s of the Sea; others derive it from <HI>Ammir,</HI> an <HI>Arabian</HI> word, which &s;ignifieth a King, or Emperor; And &s;ome would have it to come from the low Dutch, <HI>Aen-meer-all,</HI> which &s;ignifie, <HI>on the Sea all,</HI> The Reader, according as his own judgement leads him, may ad|here to which he plea&s;e; for I know of none that have po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted, which is the true&s;t.</P>
<P>But to know the nature and juri&s;diction of this Court, it will conduce very much, if we in&s;ert here certain grievances which the Lord Admiral pre&s;ented in the <HI>8th</HI> year of K. <HI>James,</HI> concerning <HI>Prohibitions,</HI> granted by the Judges of the Courts of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> again&s;t the Juri&s;diction and Prerogatives of this Court, with the an&s;wer which the Judges returned to every point.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t Objection was, that whereas the cognizance of all Contracts, and other things done upon the Sea, belongeth to the Admirals juri&s;diction, the &s;ame are made tryable at the common Law, as if they had bin done in <HI>Cheap&s;ide</HI> and &s;uch places.</P>
<P>The Judges of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall</HI> an&s;wered, that by the Lawes of the Realm, the Court of the Admiral hath no cognizance, power, or juri&s;diction of any manner of Contract, plea, or querele, within any County of the Realm, either upon the Land or the water; but every Contract, Plea, or querele, and all o|ther things ari&s;ing in any County of the Realm, either upon the Land, or the water; and al&s;o Wrecks of the Sea, ought to be tryed, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, determined, and remedied by the common Lawes of the Land, and not before, or by, the Admiral or his Lieutenant, in any manner; &s;o that it is not material, whether the place be upon the water, <HI>intra fluxum &amp; refluxum aqua,</HI> or whether it be upon any other water within the precincts of a County. But the &s;aid Judges acknowledged, that of Contracts, pleas, and quereles, made upon the Sea, or any part thereof, which is not within any County, from whence no tryal can be had by twelve men, the Admiral hath, and ought to have juri&s;diction. And no pre&s;ident can be &s;hewed, that any Prohibition hath bin granted for any plea, contract, or querele, concerning any Marine cau&s;e, made or done upon the Sea, taking that only to be the Sea, wherein the Admiral hath his juri&s;diction, which is before de&s;cribed by Law to be out of any County.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="374" REF="107">
2. The &s;econd Objection was, that when actions are brought to the Admi|ralty, upon Bargains and Contracts, made beyond the Seas, wherein the com|mon Law cannot admini&s;ter ju&s;tice; yet in the&s;e ca&s;es, prohibitions are a|warded, in prejudice of the Court of Admiralty.</P>
<P>The Judges an&s;wer, that Bargains and Contracts made beyond the Sea, wherein the common Law cannot admini&s;ter ju&s;tice, do belong to the Con&s;ta|ble and Mar&s;hal; For the juri&s;diction of the Admiralty, is wholly confined to the Sea, which is out of any County; but if any Indenture, Bond, or other &s;pecialty, or any Contract, be made beyond the Seas, for doing of any act, or payment of any money, within this Realm, or otherwi&s;e, wherein the com|mon Law can admini&s;ter ju&s;tice, and give ordinary redre&s;s: In the&s;e ca&s;es, neither the Con&s;table nor Mar&s;hal, nor the Court of Admiralty, hath any juri&s;|diction: therefore when that Court hath proceeding, in derogation of the common Law, prohibitions have bin i&s;&s;ued out, as by the Law they ought.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third Objection was, that whereas time out of minde, the Court of Admiralty hath taken &s;tipulations for appearance, and performance of the acts and judgements of the &s;ame Court, It is now affirmed, by the Judges of the common Law, that the Admirals Court, is no Court of Record, and therefore not able to take &s;uch &s;tipulations: hereupon, prohibitions are granted, to the utter overthrow of that juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>The Judges an&s;wered, that the Court of the Admiralty, proceeding by the cour&s;e of the Civil Law, is no Court of Record, and therefore cannot take any &s;uch a recognizance as a Court of Record may. And for taking Recognizan&s;es again&s;t the Law of the Realm, we finde, that prohibitions have bin granted. And if an erroneous &s;entence be given in that Court, no Writ of Error, but an appeal before certain Delegates do lye, which proves, 'tis no Court of Re|cord.</P>
<P N="4">4. The fourth Objection was, that Charter parties, made only to be per|formed upon the Seas, are daily withdrawn from that Court by prohibi|tions.</P>
<P>The Judges an&s;wered, That if the Charter party be made within any City, Port-Town, or County of this Realm, although it be to be performed, either upon the Seas, or beyond the Seas, yet it is to be tryed and determined by the ordinary cour&s;e of the Common Law, and not in the Court of the Admiralty, And therefore, when that Court hath encroached upon the common Law, in that ca&s;e, the Iudge of the Admiralty, and party there &s;uing, have bin prohibi|ted, and oftentimes the party condemned, in great and grievous dammages, by the Lawes of the Realm.</P>
<P N="5">5. The fifth Objection was, that not with&s;tanding the clau&s;e of <HI>Nou ob&s;tante &s;tatuto,</HI> which hath foundation in his Maje&s;ties Prerogative, and is current in all other grants; yet in the Lord Admirals Patent, 'tis &s;aid to be of no force, to warrant the determination of the Cau&s;es, committed to him in his Lord|&s;hips Patent, and &s;o rejected by the Iudges of the common Law.</P>
<P>The common Lawyers an&s;wer, that without all que&s;tion, the &s;undry Statutes which declare the juri&s;diction of the Court of Admiralty, and wherein all the Subjects of the Realm have intere&s;t, cannot be di&s;pen&s;ed with, by any <HI>non ob|&s;tante &s;tatuto;</HI> and therefore not worthy of any an&s;wer; but by colour there|of the Court of Admiralty hath, contrary to tho&s;e Acts of Parliament, en|croached upon the Juri&s;diction of the common Law, to the intolerable grie|vance of Subjects, which hath oftentimes urged them to complain, in his Ma|je&s;ties ordinary Courts of ju&s;tice in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall,</HI> for their relief in that behalf.</P>
<P N="6">6. The &s;ixth Objection was, that to the end that the Admirals juri&s;diction, might receive all manner of empeachment, and interruption, the Rivers be|neath the fir&s;t Bridges where it ebbeth and floweth, and all the Creeks and
<PB N="375" REF="107">
Ports are by the Iudges of the common Law, affirmed to be no part of the Sea, nor within the Admirals juri&s;diction, and thereupon, prohibitions are ordina|rily awarded upon actions depending in that Court for Contracts, and other things done in tho&s;e places, notwith&s;tanding, that by u&s;e and practi&s;e, time out of minde, the Admirals Court hath had juri&s;diction, within &s;uch Ports, Creeks, and Rivers.</P>
<P>The Judges an&s;wer was like to their fir&s;t, And 'twas further added, that for the death of a man, or mayhm in tho&s;e two ca&s;es, only done in great Ships, be|ing and hovering in the main &s;tream only, beneath the point of &s;ome Ri|vers nigh unto the Sea, and no other place of the &s;ame Rivers, nor in other cau&s;es, but only in tho&s;e two, the Admiral hath cognizance. But for all Con|tracts, Pleas, and Quereles, made or done upon a River, Haven, or Creek with|in any County of this Realm, the Admiral without que&s;tion hath no juri&s;dicti|on; for then he &s;hould hold plea of things, done within the Body of the Coun|ty, which are tryable by verdict of twelve men, and meerly determinable by the common Law, and not within the Court of the Admiralty, according to the Civil Law; for that were to change and alter the Lawes of the Realm in like ca&s;es, and make tho&s;e Contracts, Pleas, and Quereles, tryable by the common Law of the Realm, to be drawn off <HI>ad aliud Examen,</HI> and to be &s;entenced by the Iudges of the Admiralty, according to the Civil Law.</P>
<P N="7">7. The &s;eventh Objection was, that the Agreement made <HI>Anno</HI> 1575. between the Judges of the Kings Bench, and the Court of the Admiralty, for the more quiet and certain Execution of Admiral Iuri&s;diction, is not ob&s;erved as it ought to be.</P>
<P>The Iudges an&s;wered, that the &s;uppo&s;ed Agreement, mentioned in the Ar|ticle, hath not as yet bin delivered them; but having heard the &s;ame read be|fore his Maje&s;ty; they an&s;wer'd, that for &s;o much thereof, as differeth from the&s;e an&s;wers, it is again&s;t the Lawes, and Statutes of this Realm: therefore the Iudges of the Kings Bench, never a&s;&s;ented thereunto, as was preten|ded.</P>
<P N="8">8. The eighth Objection was, That many other grievances there were, which in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing of the&s;e former, would ea&s;ily appear worthy of Reformation.</P>
<P>To this the Judges an&s;wered, that this Article was &s;o general, as no particu|lar an&s;wer can be made thereunto, only it appeareth, by that which hath bin &s;aid, that the Lord Admiral his Officers and Mini&s;ters principally by colour of that <HI>Non ob&s;tante,</HI> and for want of learned advice, have inju&s;tly encroached up|on the common Lawes of this Realm; for which the marvel is the le&s;&s;e, be|cau&s;e that the Lord Admiral his Lieutenants, Officers, and Mini&s;ters, have with|out all colour, intruded upon the Right and Prerogative due to the Crown, in that they have &s;eized and converted to their own u&s;e, Goods and Chattels, of infinite value taken at Sea; and other Goods and Chattels, which in no &s;ort, appertain unto his Lord&s;hip, by his Letters Patents, wherein the &s;aid <HI>Non ob|&s;tante</HI> is contained; and for which, he and his Officers, remain accountable to his Maje&s;ty; And they now wanting, in this time of peace, cau&s;es apper|taining to their natural juri&s;diction, do now encroach upon the juri&s;diction of the common Law, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;it idle, and reap no profit.</P>
<P>They added further, That touching their proceedings in granting of Pro|hibitions concerning any of the &s;aid <HI>Articles,</HI> two things were to be con&s;idered of, fir&s;t the <HI>matter,</HI> then the <HI>manner;</HI> touching the matter, nothing hath bin done therein, by the Court of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> but by good Warrant of Law, and former judicial Precedents; And for the manner, they granted none in the Va|cation time, nor in their Terme time, in any of their Chambers, nor in the Court in the Terme-time, <HI>ex officio,</HI> but upon motion made in open Court, by learned Councel; and after a day prefixed, and warning given to the adver&s;e party, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P>Concerning the &s;econd proof by Judgements, and <HI>Judicial Precedents,</HI> and the third by <HI>Book-Ca&s;es,</HI> they alledged divers Ca&s;es, which are to be &s;een in that great light, and laborious Champion of the Common Law of <HI>England,</HI> the Lord <HI>Coke,</HI> in the third part of his <HI>In&s;titutes;</HI> But, the Re&s;ult of all which the Iudges of the Common Law driv' at, was, that the Court of Admiralty, was to take no Cognizance, nor had power to determine any thing that had happen|ed, and &s;hould give occa&s;ion of Plea, upon any Waters, either fre&s;h or &s;alt, that were within the Precincts of any County; but it was tryable by the Com|mon Law of <HI>England,</HI> and by the Empanelment, and Verdict of twelve men, which is not the way of Tryal of the Civil Law, by which the Admiralty is di|rected.</P>
<P>By this notable cla&s;h, and conte&s;tation 'twixt the Iudges of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall</HI> and the <HI>Lord Admiral,</HI> the Reader may learn what the extent of the Authority of that Court is, and that the juri&s;diction of the Admiral is confined to the high Sea.</P>
<P>In times pa&s;t, there were di&s;tinct Admirals, in point of power, as we read in <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econds Raign, the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> was Admiral of the North; and the Earl of <HI>Devon&s;hire,</HI> Admiral of the We&s;t: who were to receive the Sub&s;idy of Poundage and Tonnage, for the garding of the Seas.</P>
<P>Among other Prerogatives, which belonged to the Lord Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> one was to erect <HI>Beacons</HI> upon the Maritim Coa&s;ts; which word, is derived from the old <HI>Saxon,</HI> or <HI>Dutch Becnam,</HI> which &s;ignifieth, to give a &s;igne, as we u&s;e the word, to <HI>becken at</HI> to this day.</P>
<P>Before the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the <HI>3d,</HI> there were but &s;takes of Wood, &s;et upon high places, which were fired, upon the di&s;covery of any enemies; but in his time, pitched Barrels were &s;et up; and by the Law of the Land, who&s;oever fired a <HI>Beacon, commits Felony,</HI> unle&s;s there were Authority and ju&s;t cau&s;e for it.</P>
<P>In other Countries they are called <HI>Phares,</HI> which are no other then <HI>&s;pecula|tory,</HI> or maritime monitory fires, which &s;erve for two ends, as well to direct Sea faring men, as to fore-warn the approach of an Enemy; which with &s;uch wonderful celerity, give the whole Land an Alarum, and &s;o puts them in a po|&s;ture of defence.</P>
<P>But there are three main matters, whereof the Lord Admiral is to take Cognizance, which are <HI>Flot&s;an, Jet&s;an,</HI> and <HI>Lagan:</HI> whereof the fir&s;t is, when a Ship is &s;unk and peri&s;hed, and the Goods floating upon the waters: The &s;e|cond is <HI>Jet&s;an,</HI> when in &s;tre&s;&s;e of weather, or other occa&s;ions, the Goods are thrown over-board. The third is, when Goods are tyed to a Cork, or Cable, and may be found again; But the Court of Admiralty, hath not to do with <HI>Wrecks;</HI> for then the Goods are depo&s;ited in the cu&s;tody of the Officers of the next Town, where, if the Proprietor come within a twelve moneth and a day, he may claim them by Law.</P>

<HI>Henry</HI> the &s;ixth did con&s;titute by Charter, <HI>John Holland,</HI> Duke of <HI>Exceter,</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> his Son, to be <HI>Admirallos Angliae:</HI> But the Iudges of the Common Law, held that Charter to be invalid; and the Rea&s;on they alledged, was, that that Charter being of a <HI>Judicial</HI> Office, it could not be granted to two.</P>
<P>When the former conte&s;tation happened 'twixt the Court of <HI>Admiralty</HI> and <HI>We&s;tminster-Hall,</HI> they were choy&s;e powerful men at that time, who &s;wayed as <HI>Grandees</HI> of the <HI>Common Law,</HI> as Sir <HI>Edward Coke,</HI> the Lord <HI>Bacon,</HI> Iudge <HI>Dod|dridge,</HI> and <HI>Hubbard,</HI> which made them carry the Bucklers from the <HI>Civilians,</HI> at that time; But there were &s;ome learned Treati&s;es publi&s;hed afterward, to vindicate the Right of the <HI>Civil Law;</HI> which, without controver&s;ie, hath more in it of natural equity, and reaches of pure Rea&s;on, then any other: It is the Product of that mighty Monarchy of the <HI>Romans,</HI> who though they conquered by the <HI>Lance,</HI> yet they con&s;erved by their <HI>Lawes,</HI> &s;o many va&s;t di&s;tant Territo|ries, and Nations, which they had &s;ubdued, leading &s;o many people Captive by their <HI>policy,</HI> as much as by their <HI>Prowe&s;&s;e;</HI> And indeed, the <HI>Civil Law</HI> is fitted for the general Affaires of mankind, and for all Nations; For though every particular &s;tate hath &s;ome few municipal Lawes peculiar to it &s;elf: yet no where beyond the Seas is there any profe&s;&s;ion or Science of Law but of the <HI>Civil;</HI> nor are there any other &s;tudied in <HI>Univer&s;ities.</HI> Only in <HI>England</HI> there are <HI>Inns of Court,</HI> which are equivalent to an <HI>Academy,</HI> where <HI>lex Terrae,</HI> or the common municipal Law of the Land is &s;tudied, and Graduates proceed, and are made therein accordingly, which is no where el&s;e; But the <HI>Civil Law</HI> extends to all man-kind. And, if regard be had to the Univer&s;ity of humane Rea&s;on, it is no where &s;o narrowly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, and eventilated, and the judgement rectified by clear notions: Moreover, there is nothing, of what nature &s;oever it be but the <HI>Civil Law</HI> hath ordained a means to bring it to a Tryal, either by giving a &s;pe|ciall action in the ca&s;e, or a general one releeving by ordinary remedies; or if tho&s;e fail, by &s;uch as are extraordinary, helping the Clyent, <HI>Jure actionis,</HI> or <HI>Of|ficio Judicis.</HI> Yet there was one notable Example of one bu&s;ine&s;s, that not only cau&s;ed a cla&s;h 'twixt the <HI>Civilian,</HI> and <HI>Common Lawyer,</HI> but puzzel'd them both, &s;o that neither could try it. It was, that one <HI>Peacock,</HI> &s;truck <HI>Lacy in alto Mari,</HI> and the Ship landing at <HI>Scarborough, Lacy</HI> dyed a little after, of the &s;troke that was given at Sea: there was a great conte&s;tation, whether the Court of Admiralty, or the common Lawyer, &s;hould try <HI>Peacock;</HI> but it was found, that the cogni&s;ance hereof belonged to neither, &s;o the party e&s;caped without condemnation.</P>

<P>Parliaments al&s;o were u&s;ed to be kept frequently at <HI>We&s;tminster-Hall,</HI> and one was kept in <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econds time, which proved fatal unto him; for he was depo&s;ed there, notwith&s;tanding, that he had bin the greate&s;t Repairer of that Hall, when it had bin de&s;troyed by fire.

<P>In this great Palace at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> there was St. <HI>Stephens</HI> Chappel, which was built by King <HI>Stephen</HI> him&s;elf; It was repaired and enlarged by <HI>Edward</HI> the third, and 38. per&s;ons were appointed there to &s;erve God, <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI>Dean,</HI> 12. &s;ecular Canons, 13.

<P>This Chappel of St. <HI>Stephens,</HI> at the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion in <HI>Henry</HI> the eights time, was valued to di&s;pend one thou&s;and eighty five pounds; and in <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixths time it was made to &s;erve as a Parliament for the Hou&s;e of <HI>Commons,</HI> who formerly were u&s;ed to &s;it in the <HI>Chapter-hou&s;e</HI> of the Abbot of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>Before the Great Hall, there is a large Court, called now the new Palace, where there is a &s;trong Tower of Stone, containing a Clock, which &s;triketh on a great Bell every houre, to give notice to the Judges, how the time pa&s;&s;eth; when the wind is <HI>South South-We&s;t,</HI> it may be heard into any part of <HI>London,</HI> and commonly, it pre&s;ageth wet weather: The <HI>Dean</HI> of St. <HI>Stephens,</HI> was u&s;ed to have the keeping of this Clock, having &s;ix pence every day out of the <HI>Exchequer,</HI> for keeping the <HI>Kings Clock,</HI> or Great <HI>Tom</HI> of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI></P>

'Tis &s;uch a ravi&s;hing voluptuous place, that there are objects to plea&s;e and charm all the five &s;en&s;es, The eyes are fed in beholding the goodly Structures, Gardens, and Trees which are up and down: The Eares by hearing, the chirping of the Birds, and &s;weet murmure of the waters; The <HI>&s;mell</HI> is fea&s;ted with odoriferous &s;ent of flowers, and other rich perfumes; The <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> by mo&s;t delicate fruits; And the other &s;en&s;e, by mo&s;t beautiful, and ravi&s;hing Women, which are able to tempt a Stoick, having by their rowling large eyes, and other po&s;tures, extraordinary wayes of al|lurement. There was a computation made of above a million of Hou|&s;es within her, &s;o that allowing ten to a Family, there be ordinarily about ten Millions of humane &s;ouls that breath within the City; They are very rich in their Habits, and there is not much difference in the Clothes of male and female, only the women have more diver&s;ity of colours; blew and red are the commone&s;t, but black is never worn: There be Birds there, of &s;uch a wonderful bigne&s;s, that they will take up a whole Mutton alive, up into the Air, and &s;ometimes a man in Armor.</P>
<P>There are abundance of <HI>Elephants, Dromedaries, Camels,</HI> and other huge Bea&s;ts, that do their work; And all Animals, both volatil, and terre&s;trial, are there, of a bigger &s;ize and proportion, then any where

Among other cau|&s;es, this may be imputed to the Trade of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, which is appropriated unto Her, and to a mixture with the Jewes, who have there two Synagogues: yet is this fre&s;h great Mercantile Town, much inferior to <HI>London,</HI> almo&s;t in all things.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, in point of populou&s;ne&s;s, as may be conjectured out of her weekly Bills of Mortality, which at the utmo&s;t, come but to about three&s;core a week; whence may be inferred, that <HI>London</HI> is five times more populous; for the number that dies in Her every week, comes commonly, to near upon three hundred.</P>
<P>Secondly, in point of Wealth, <HI>Amsterdam</HI> comes &s;hort of <HI>London;</HI> for when Sir <HI>Ralph Freeman</HI> was Lord Mayor, it was found out by more than a probable conjecture, that He, with the 24. Aldermen, his Brethren, might have bought the E&s;tates of one hundred of the riche&s;t Bourgema&s;ters in <HI>Am&s;terdam.</HI> Then, for &s;weet|ne&s;&s;e of Site, and &s;alubrity of Air, &s;he is &s;o far inferior to <HI>London,</HI> that her Inhabitants may be &s;aid to draw in Fogs, in lieu of free Air, the Countrey being all mar&s;h and moori&s;h about Her; &s;o that <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> is built as it were in a bog, or quag; for in their fabriques, they are forced to dig &s;o deep for a firm foundation, by ramming in huge Piles of Wood, that the Ba&s;is of a Hou&s;e, doth often times co&s;t more then the &s;uper&s;tructure.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> hath neither Conduit, Well, or Fountain of fre&s;h water within her, but it is brought to her by Boats; and they wa&s;h with Rain water, which every Hou&s;e pre&s;erves in Ci&s;terns, to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Touching the River of <HI>Texel,</HI> that brings her in all Commodities &s;he is nothing comparable to the <HI>Thames,</HI> in point of &s;ecurity of &s;ayl|ing, or &s;weetne&s;s of water: touching the fir&s;t, they &s;ay there &s;tood a Forre&s;t of Wood in times pa&s;t, where now the <HI>Texel</HI> makes her bed, which could not be cut down &s;o clean, but there are divers ill favoured

Trunks, and &s;tubs of Trees, &s;till found under water, which is a great annoyance to Ships.</P>
<P>There are in the United Provinces, many jolly Towns be&s;ides, which may be ranked among them of the fir&s;t magnitude, e&s;pecially <HI>Utrecht,</HI> which hath the face of an ancient &s;tately Town, &amp; &s;ub&s;i&s;ts more by her &s;elf: the re&s;t grow great, and flouri&s;h in Wealth, Buildings, and People, by having &s;ome peculiar &s;taple Commodity appropria|ted unto them, as <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> hath the Trade of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies a&s;&s;igned Her, (as was formerly mentioned). <HI>Rotterdam,</HI> hath the Staple of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth; <HI>Dort,</HI> of the <HI>Rheni&s;h-Wine,</HI> and <HI>Corn</HI> that comes from <HI>Germany; Haerlam</HI> hath a Charter for <HI>Weaving</HI> and <HI>Knitting; Leyden</HI> is an Univer&s;ity; The <HI>Hague</HI> &s;ub&s;i&s;ts by the re&s;idence of the <HI>Hoghen Moghen,</HI> the Councel of State; <HI>Middleburgh</HI> in <HI>Zeland,</HI> by the Staple of <HI>French</HI> Wines; <HI>Trevere,</HI> by the <HI>Scots</HI> Commodities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but none of the&s;e bear any proportion with the City of <HI>London,</HI> who trades in all the&s;e &s;everal Commodities together, and hath particu|lar Corporations accordingly, with many more.</P>
<P>We will now hoy&s;e up Sayl for <HI>France,</HI> which al&s;o hath divers Ci|ties of the fir&s;t Magnitude, as <HI>Rouen</HI> in <HI>Normandy, Bourdeaux</HI> in <HI>Ga&s;|cogny, Tholou&s;e</HI> in <HI>Languedock,</HI> with the other five Courts of Parlia|ment; as al&s;o <HI>Amiens</HI> in <HI>Picardy,</HI> and the City of <HI>Lions,</HI> and <HI>Mar&s;eilles:</HI> the one whereof, &s;ub&s;i&s;ts by her <HI>Bank;</HI> the other, by being the chief Ar&s;enal of the <HI>French</HI> Gallies; but none of the&s;e will offer, I think, to compare with the City of <HI>London,</HI> nor any of tho&s;e Towns that &s;tand upon the <HI>Loire,</HI> whereof there are many gentile ones.</P>
<P><HI>Paris</HI> I confe&s;s, may be capable of &s;ome Compari&s;ons with <HI>London,</HI> for which &s;he hath many helps, as being a <HI>Cit&egrave;, Vill&egrave; &amp; Univer&s;it&egrave;, a City,</HI> a <HI>Town,</HI> and an <HI>Univer&s;ity;</HI> as al&s;o the chief re&s;idence of the <HI>French</HI> Kings, and the Parliament.</P>
<P>But lets go a little to particulars. And fir&s;t, to the populou&s;|ne&s;s of both Cities; They &s;ay in <HI>Paris,</HI> that the Pari&s;hes of Saint <HI>Eu|&s;tance,</HI> and Saint <HI>Innocent,</HI> have above one hundred thou&s;and Commu|nicants in them alone: and that by the la&s;t Cen&s;e that was made there, was near upon a million of humane &s;ouls, found in the City and Sub|urbs of <HI>Paris.</HI> It may be &s;o, but we &s;hall find in the en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e that <HI>London</HI> hath more.</P>
<P>Secondly, for magnitude: 'tis true, that <HI>Paris</HI> hath the advantage of an <HI>Orbicular</HI> figure, and &s;o is more capacious. But by the judgement of tho&s;e Mathematicians, who have ob&s;erved both Cities; if <HI>London</HI> were ca&s;t into a Circle, &s;he would with all her dimen&s;ions, be alto|gether as big as <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>Touching the <HI>Loure,</HI> 'tis true, that it is a va&s;t fabrick, and the like is not found in <HI>London;</HI> but it is the only Court the French King hath in <HI>Paris,</HI> whereas in <HI>London</HI> there are fower Royal Seates, with two Parks annexed to one; I hope the <HI>Ba&s;tile</HI> will not offer to compare with the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London,</HI> nor the River of <HI>Seine</HI> with the <HI>Thames;</HI> much le&s;&s;e I believe, will <HI>Paris</HI> offer to make any compari&s;ons with <HI>London,</HI> in point of Traffique, and Societies of Noble adventuring Marchants,

who trade on both the Hemi&s;pheres; nor of her Provo&s;t with the Lord Mayor of <HI>London.</HI> I allow <HI>Paris</HI> to have rich <HI>Banquiers,</HI> but they are mo&s;t of them &s;trangers, and not Natives.</P>
<P>Moreover, I think <HI>Paris</HI> would be loth to compare with <HI>London</HI> for neatne&s;s of &s;treets, or for &s;weetne&s;s of &s;ite; for <HI>Paris</HI> hath &s;carce any verdure about her, but the <HI>Proclere;</HI> whereas <HI>London</HI> hath mo&s;t delightful Fields round about Her, of a deeper greene, not &s;o fading as that of <HI>France:</HI> and touching &s;treets, the dirt and crott of <HI>Paris</HI> may be &s;melt ten miles off, and leaves &s;uch a tenacious oily &s;tain, that it is indelible, and can never be wa&s;hed off; 'tis confe&s;&s;ed, that <HI>Paris</HI> hath waters of a &s;ingular vertue, for the die of Scarlets; but 'tis as well known to the World, what extraordinary Vertues the <HI>Thames</HI> water hath for many things. Ask the <HI>Hollander,</HI> and he will tell you, there is no &s;uch water to fatten Eeles, and all &s;orts of Fi&s;h. <HI>Thames</HI> water Beer bears the price of Wine, in many places beyond the Seas. And the <HI>Portugalls</HI> have found of late, &s;uch vertue in that water, that they car|ry it away by whole Tuns, to <HI>Li&s;bon.</HI> I might enlarge my &s;elf further, in &s;hewing what advantage the City of <HI>London</HI> hath of <HI>Paris,</HI> but I will &s;u&s;pend my Di&s;cour&s;e till I proceed a little further, only I will conclude this Paragraffe with this one Objection, that <HI>London</HI> hath far better blood in her Veins, then <HI>Paris,</HI> I mean a greater number of whol&s;om Springs, Conduits, Aqueducts, and Sources of &s;weet waters, whereof <HI>Paris</HI> hath not &s;o many. And now there comes into my me|mory, a facetious pa&s;&s;age, between <HI>Henry</HI> the <HI>4th,</HI> and the <HI>Provost</HI> of <HI>Paris,</HI> touching tho&s;e waters; which happened thus. The King had appointed the <HI>Sui&s;se</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors, whereof there were many in Com|mi&s;&s;ion, to be lodged in the City, and that plenty of the be&s;t Wines &s;hould be provided for them; The Amba&s;&s;adors having lain long upon the <HI>Pari&s;ians,</HI> and drunk daily very deep, and being at la&s;t di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. The <HI>Provo&s;t</HI> made an humble Remon&s;trance to the King, how the City had &s;o long time win'd the Sui&s;&s;e Amba&s;&s;adors, and their numerous retinue, which put Her in &s;ome Arreares, there|fore he humbly prayed, in the name of the City, that his Maje&s;ty would be plea&s;ed to give leave, that a &s;mall Tax might be laid for a while upon the Water-pipes and Ce&s;terns of fre&s;h Waters, for the di&s;charge of tho&s;e Arrears for Wine, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The King plea&s;antly an|&s;wered, <HI>Ventre de Saint Gris,</HI> there mu&s;t be &s;ome other way found out to do this; for <HI>'Twas our Saviour only, that could turn water into Wine, therefore he would not pre&s;ume to attempt it.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus rambled up and down the World, and ca&s;t &s;ome few glances upon the mo&s;t renowned Cities; and having pointed before, at twenty properties, wherein <HI>London</HI> may well compare with any of the greate&s;t Cities in <HI>Europe,</HI> we will now more particularly, treat a little of tho&s;e properties, and take them all &s;ingle, as they are ranked.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t is, Conveniency of Situation, and &s;alubrity of Air, wherein the wi&s;dom of the old <HI>Britains</HI> our Ance&s;tors, in point of E|lection of the place, and the benignity of the Heavens, in point of
<PB N="392" REF="116">
influences and temperature, have made <HI>London</HI> as happy as any other City under the va&s;t Canopy of the Heavens; &s;ome &s;ay, that that Ci|ty is be&s;t &s;ituated, which re&s;embleth a <HI>Camels</HI> back, who hath protu|berancies, and bunches, &s;o a City &s;hould be &s;eated upon ri&s;ing grounds, or &s;mall Hillocks; It is the po&s;ture of <HI>London;</HI> for &s;he is builded upon the flanks, &s;ides, and tops of divers &s;mall Hillocks, lying near the Banks of a Noble River, and being encompa&s;&s;ed about with delightful green Medows, and Fields on all &s;ides; and &s;he is in &s;o fair a di&s;tance from the Sea, that no danger of forren inva&s;ion can &s;urprize her, but &s;he mu&s;t have notice before: The nature of her Soyl s &s;andy, which is whol&s;omo&s;t for Habitation, and conduceth much o goodne&s;s of Air, the barrenne&s;s whereof, is made prolifical by art.</P>
<P N="2">2. Touching the &s;econd property, which is a method of &s;trict, and punctual Government, ther's no City goes beyond her, or indeed e|qualls her, take night and day together; for there is not the lea&s;t mi&s;demeanor, or inconvenience that can be; but there be Officers in e|very corner of the City to pry into them, and find them out; but e&s;|pecially, the <HI>Wardmote Inquest,</HI> which are to be men of repute, and known integrity; They by vertue of their Office inquire, if any man outlawed, or indited of Trea&s;on, or Felony, lurk within the Ward; They inquire if the publique peace be any way di&s;turbed, or broken; They enquire of all offences, and dammages done to the River of Thames, and make a &s;peedy pre&s;entment of them to be redre&s;&s;ed; They inquire after Riotors, di&s;&s;olute per&s;ons, and Barrators, walking by nightertayle, without light at un&s;ea&s;onable houres.

And three&s;core Companies of Citizens be&s;ides; whereunto the new Company of <HI>Coachmen,</HI> is lately added, who have their Halls, their regular Orders, and Officers accordingly; And touching all &s;orts of Artificers, and variety of in|du&s;trious wayes to improve all kind of Manufactures, and thereby gain an hone&s;t Livelihood, and &s;o enrich the place. <HI>London</HI> may be called a <HI>Hive of Bees,</HI> (as formerly was touched) or a <HI>Hill of Ants,</HI> which have bin alwayes made the Emblems of indu&s;try, and pro|vidence.</P>

<P>By the&s;e &s;hort di&s;qui&s;itions into the Ages of the World and Hi&s;to|ry, it appears, that among the Patriarks, there were <HI>holy places</HI> that had an Analogy with Churches, which continues among the <HI>Jewes</HI> ever &s;ince: And touching Chri&s;tians, there were Oratories, and ap|propriate &s;acred places, from the very infancy of the Go&s;pel, which &s;erved as a general Rendezvouz to celebrate Divine &s;ervice all along from the Apo&s;tles time, through the three Centuries of the Primi|tive Church: therefore they mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a &s;trange &s;pirit of contradiction, and prophane&s;s, who make no account of tho&s;e peculiar Hou&s;es, which pious devout &s;ouls have appropriated, rea'rd up, and dedicated to the &s;ole &s;ervice of Almighty God, but hold all places promi&s;cuous, and indifferently proper for that u&s;e.</P>
<P>It may ju&s;tly be doubted, whether &s;uch &s;ordid poor narrow &s;ouls, who &s;o malign the beauty, the holine&s;s, and decencies of Gods Hou&s;e here in the Church <HI>militant,</HI> will ever be admitted to behold the glory of the Church <HI>Triumphant.</HI></P>
<P>And now, having pre&s;umed to &s;peak &s;o much of <HI>Londons</HI> great Temple (than which there is not a more con&s;picuous Object upon Earth, except the Mount <HI>Olympus,</HI> which is &s;aid to bear up Heaven); and having with a true &s;en&s;e of &s;orrow &s;et forth the &s;ad condition thereof, my prayers are, that it would plea&s;e God to put it into the hearts, and move the &s;pirits of tho&s;e worthy Patriots, who are now a&s;&s;embled to mend all breaches in the Common-wealth, to propo&s;e &s;ome way for pre&s;erving this ancient great vi&s;ible Ornament from tumbling down: And there is a fair opportunity offered to this pur|po&s;e; for if tho&s;e irregular New Buildings be que&s;tioned (whereof there are by computation, above a hundred thou&s;and pop'd up with|in the&s;e forty years), It would, mo&s;t humbly under favour, be very proper to employ part of the Tax upon tho&s;e Hou&s;es, to repair Gods Hou&s;e.</P>

<P N="15">15. For number of humane &s;ouls, breathing in City and Suburbs; <HI>London</HI> may compare with any in <HI>Europe,</HI> in point of populou&s;ne&s;s: the la&s;t Cen&s;e that was made in <HI>Paris,</HI> came under a million; but in the year 1636. King <HI>Charles</HI> &s;ending to the Lord Mayor, to make a &s;crutiny, what number of <HI>Roman Catholiques</HI> and <HI>&s;trangers,</HI> there were in the City, he took occa&s;ion thereby, to make a Cen&s;e of all the people; and there were of Men, Women, and Children, above &s;even hundred thou&s;and that lived within the Barres of his juri&s;diction a|lone; and this being one and twenty years pa&s;&s;ed, 'tis thought, by all probable computation, that <HI>London</HI> hath more by the third part now, then &s;he had then. Now, for <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Petty France,</HI> the <HI>Strand, Bedford Berry,</HI> St. <HI>Martins Lane, Long Acre, Drury Lane,</HI> St. <HI>Giles</HI> of the Field, High <HI>Holborn, Grayes Inne Lane,</HI> St. <HI>Jones,</HI> and St. <HI>Georges &s;treet, Clarken well,</HI> the out-lets of <HI>Red</HI> and <HI>Whitecro&s;se-&s;treet,</HI> the out-lets be|yond the Barres of <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate, Alder&s;gate,</HI> and <HI>Southwark</HI> Barres, beyond the <HI>Tower, &amp;c.</HI> take all the&s;e places, with divers more, which are conti|guous, and one entire peece with <HI>London</HI> her &s;elf, I &s;ay, take all the&s;e Buildings together, there will be found by all probable conjecture, as many Inhabitants at lea&s;t, as were found before within that compa&s;s, where the point of the Lord Mayors Sword reacheth, which may a|mount in all, to a million and a half of humane &s;ouls: Now, one way to know the populou&s;ne&s;s of a great City is, to ob&s;erve the Bills of Mortality, and Nativities every week. I think, there is no &s;uch Cu&s;tom in <HI>Paris;</HI> but for <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> which is a very populous Mer|cantile place, the ordinary number there, of tho&s;e that go weekly out of the World, is but fifty, or thereabouts, and about &s;o many come into the World every week; But in <HI>London,</HI> the common Weekly Bills come to near upon 300. that come in, and about &s;o many that go out of the World, though the la&s;t years general Bill made twice as many to go out, as came in; for it gives account of fourteen thou&s;and and odd that dyed, and but &s;even thou&s;and chri&s;tened; but this may be imputed (the more's the pitty) to the confu&s;ion of Sectaries, which &s;warm &s;ince the long Parliament, as <HI>Anabapti&s;ts,</HI> and others who u&s;e
<PB N="404" REF="122">
not to chri&s;ten their Children, a &s;ad &s;tory to tell, &s;o that there were many thou&s;ands born, which were not baptized, and whereof the Bill &s;peaks not.</P>
<P>Touching the form and &s;hape of <HI>London,</HI> it may be aptly compa|red to a <HI>Lawrel leaf,</HI> which is far more long then broad; and were <HI>London</HI> round, as <HI>Paris</HI> and other Cities are, &s;he would appear more populous, by a more often encounter of the pa&s;&s;engers.</P>
<P>Concerning the length of <HI>London,</HI> take all Buildings that are conti|guous one to another from <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to <HI>We&s;t,</HI> from the utmo&s;t point of <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter,</HI> to the utmo&s;t point beyond the Tower, &s;he may be well thought to be near upon five <HI>Italian</HI> miles in <HI>longitude,</HI> and about half &s;o much in <HI>latitude,</HI> and in Circuit, above twelve miles. 'Tis true, that the Suburbs of <HI>London</HI> are larger then the Body of the City, which make &s;ome compare her to a <HI>Je&s;uites Hat,</HI> who&s;e brims are far larger then the Block, which made Count <HI>Gondamar</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador to &s;ay, as the Queen of <HI>Spain</HI> was di&s;cour&s;ing with him, upon his return from <HI>England,</HI> of the City of <HI>London.</HI> Madam, <HI>I believe there will be no City left &s;hortly, for all will run out at the Gates to the</HI> Suburbs; <HI>and for the</HI> Men, <HI>I think they are gone by this time into the Country, for I left them all booted and &s;pur'd when I came away.</HI></P>
<P>But touching the amplitude, and largene&s;s of <HI>London,</HI> whereas <HI>Charles</HI> the Emperor, to put a Complement upon <HI>Paris,</HI> &s;aid, that &s;he might be called a <HI>Province,</HI> rather then a <HI>City,</HI> this term may bet|ter befit <HI>London,</HI> who is a <HI>County</HI> of her &s;elf.</P>
<P N="16">16.

<P><HI>Fabian</HI> the famous Chronologer was Sheriff of <HI>London,</HI> and born there; what a number of mo&s;t munificent Benefactors hath <HI>London</HI> had among her <HI>own Natives,</HI> be&s;ides tho&s;e whom &s;he bred; what a Noble u&s;eful Structure is <HI>Leaden-hall,</HI> built at the &s;ole charge of Sir <HI>Simon Eyre</HI> Draper, and Lord Mayor of <HI>London?</HI> what a worthy Foundation is St. <HI>Johns</HI> Colledge in <HI>Oxford,</HI> built by Sir <HI>Thomas White,</HI> Lord Mayor of <HI>London,</HI> who was Benefactor al&s;o to <HI>Bri&s;toll, Reading,</HI> and above <HI>twenty Towns</HI> be&s;ides? what a bountiful Benefactor was Mr. <HI>William Lambe,</HI> free of the Company of <HI>Clothworkers?</HI> what a world of charitable deeds, did he do in Town and Countrey? what a Noble &s;oul had Sir <HI>Thomas Gre&s;ham</HI> Mercer, and Marchant, who built the <HI>Royal Exchange, Gre&s;ham Colledge,</HI> with another great Countrey Pa|lace in <HI>Middle&s;ex;</HI> what a notable Benefactor, was Mr. <HI>Thomas Howel,</HI> bred in his youth in <HI>Spain,</HI> and afterwards in <HI>London,</HI> who was one of the greate&s;t Benefactors of the Company of <HI>Drapers,</HI> and, be&s;ides ma|ny other large acts of charity, he hath left &s;uch means to <HI>Drapers</HI> Hall, that if any Mayden can derive her &s;elf from the right linage of <HI>Howel</HI> in <HI>Wales,</HI> the &s;aid Hall is to give her 21 <HI>l.</HI> towards her portion; and this to continue for ever; what a free large Soul had Mr. <HI>William Jones,</HI> Marchant, and free of the <HI>Haberda&s;hers,</HI> who in <HI>Monmouth,</HI> the Coun|trey where he was born, did build a fair <HI>Free School,</HI> with very large allowance to the Ma&s;ters; he was Benefactor al&s;o to <HI>Hamborough, Stoad,</HI> and divers other places at home and abroad. To the&s;e two <HI>Bri|tains,</HI> we will add a third, which is Sir <HI>Hugh Middleton,</HI> Gold&s;mith; what a hazardous, expenceful mighty work, did he perform, in bringing <HI>Ware-</HI>River to run through the &s;treets of <HI>London?</HI> what an infinite univer&s;al benefit doth accrue thereby, to the whole City and Suburbs? how often did this great de&s;ign take heat and cold, what faintings and fears, what oppo&s;itions did it break through, before it was perfectly fini&s;hed?</P>

<P>At <HI>Campden,</HI> in the County of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI> he repaired, and adorned God Almighties Hou&s;e, and reard another for the poor, before he built any for him&s;elf; He founded al&s;o there, a very commodious <HI>Market-hou&s;e,</HI> and having done many things more for the publick
<PB N="406" REF="123">
good in that place, he erected afterwards, a &s;tately Palace for his Po&s;terity, though the hard fate of the times, and the fury of the Warre hath half de&s;troyed it: He was al&s;o a great Benefactor to the Churches, and the poor of <HI>Hamsted,</HI> and <HI>Ken&s;inton,</HI> to St. <HI>Bartholomewes,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t-Church</HI> Ho&s;pitals in <HI>London,</HI> to all the Pri&s;ons; as al&s;o to St. <HI>Laurence</HI> Church in the old <HI>Jury:</HI> He purcha&s;ed divers <HI>Impropriations,</HI> and be&s;towed them upon the Church in divers counties; He was at the charge of erecting a convenient <HI>Se&s;sion-hou&s;e,</HI> for the Ju&s;tices of <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> to meet, in the midde&s;t of St. <HI>John's &s;treet,</HI> which is called <HI>Hicks Hall,</HI> and will &s;o be called to all po&s;terity. All the&s;e great lights he carried before him, and at his death he gave a World of Legacies, and divers Pen&s;ions to pious Mini&s;ters and others, and be|queathed a great &s;um to be di&s;tributed among all his Servants.</P>
<P>To &s;peak of all tho&s;e Noble <HI>Londoners,</HI> who have done glorious things, both for Church and State, in point of piety, &s;tately Structures of divers natures, for the publick good, and deeds of charity, would make a large Volume of it &s;elf. I will conclude for the pre&s;ent, with a late worthy man, one Mr. <HI>John Walter,</HI> who was Clark of <HI>Dra|pers Hall,</HI> who, having re&s;olved with him&s;elf, when he had attained a competent &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for him&s;elf and his Children, to employ the re&s;t every year, for charitable u&s;es, which he did con&s;tantly for many years: He built two Ho&s;pitals near <HI>London,</HI> and it was a great while before the Founder of them was known. He u&s;ed to &s;end a proporti|on of bread to be di&s;tributed among the poor, to divers Churches; and it was not known, who &s;ent it, till he was dead, and that he was mi&s;|&s;ing. It is thought by a computation that was made, that he had em|ployed above ten thou&s;and pounds to charitable u&s;es of all &s;orts, pri|vate and publick, and he was &s;o free from vain-glory, that his greate&s;t care was to do them in &s;uch a manner, that his left hand &s;hould not know what his right hand did; And in his &s;tudy after his death, there was a bag of 800 <HI>l.</HI> in Gold, with a label in paper upon it, <HI>This is none of mine, but the poor's.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly, for Prerogatives, Enfranchi&s;ements, Immunities, Char|ters, and Liberties, for Ho&s;pitality, and plentiful treatments; as al&s;o for Antiquity, the City of <HI>London</HI> comes not in the arrears to any.</P>
<P>Touching the la&s;t, 'tis true, there are &s;ome Cities in the Ea&s;t, that have the &s;tart of her in point of time, yet <HI>London</HI> was built 354 years before <HI>Rome,</HI> which is a fair Age.</P>
<P>Touching the &s;econd, &s;ome call <HI>London,</HI> a <HI>lick-peny,</HI> (as <HI>Paris</HI> is called by &s;ome, a <HI>pick-pur&s;e)</HI> becau&s;e of fea&s;tings, with other occa&s;ions of expence and allurements, which cau&s;e &s;o many unthrifts among Countrey Gentlemen, and others, who flock into her, in &s;uch exce&s;|&s;ive multitudes; but this mu&s;t be imputed not to the place, but to the per&s;ons; for one may live in <HI>London</HI> as frugally, if he hath wit to make u&s;e of it, as in any other City what&s;oever.</P>
<P>T'is true, that the prizes of all things u&s;e to be enhanc'd by conflu|ences, and &s;warms of people, which a judicious Forreiner ob&s;erving in <HI>London,</HI> &s;aid, that &s;he bore no proportion with the Iland, but might
<PB N="407" REF="123">
&s;erve a Kingdom thrice as big, and that <HI>England</HI> may be rather &s;aid, <HI>to be in London, then London in England,</HI> which made &s;ome compare her to the <HI>&s;pleen,</HI> who&s;e over-&s;welling, make the re&s;t of the body lan|gui&s;h; but it might be an&s;wered, that <HI>London</HI> is rather like the <HI>&s;to|mack,</HI> which dige&s;ts the wealth of the Land, and after a good con|coction, di&s;per&s;eth it again in whol&s;om nutriment to all parts.</P>
<P>Touching the third, <HI>viz.</HI> freedom and immunities, there's no City hath more.</P>
<P>In the Raign of <HI>Richard</HI> the &s;econd, it was enacted, That the Citi|zens of <HI>London</HI> were to enjoy their priviledges, and franchi&s;es, <HI>licet u&s;i non fuerint, vel abu&s;i fuerint,</HI> whether they were not us'd or abus'd, notwith&s;tanding any Statute to the contrary, as the Lord <HI>Coke</HI> hath it in his <HI>In&s;titutes.</HI></P>
<P>In the Lawes of the Land, <HI>London</HI> is called &s;ometimes <HI>Camera Re|gis, Reipublicae Cor, &amp; totius Regni Epitome,</HI> the Kings Chamber, the heart of the Common-wealth, and compendium of the whole King|dom; &s;ometimes &s;he is called <HI>Caput Regum &amp; Legum,</HI> The head of Kings, and of Lawes; nay, &s;ome of the Roman Emperors in their E|dicts, called her <HI>Augu&s;ta,</HI> which is a name alwayes of magnificence and State.</P>
<P>And now will I take leave of the Noble <HI>Augu&s;ta,</HI> or City of <HI>London,</HI> concluding with this hearty wi&s;h, couch'd in the&s;e two Hexameters, and relating to her proportion, or &s;hape, which is a <HI>Laurel leaf,</HI> as formerly was &s;aid.</P>
<L>Londinum Lauri folio non impare form&acirc;,</L>
<L>Floreat Urbs, &s;icut Laurus, &s;emper&abque; vire&s;cat,</L>
