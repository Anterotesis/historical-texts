<HEAD><HI>THE</HI> Traveller's Guide, <HI>AND,</HI> The Country's Safety.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>What is Robbery.</HEAD>
<P>RObbery is the felonious ta|king of any thing from the per&s;on of another again&s;t his will, whereby the per&s;on is put in fear; though the thing taken be but to the value of a peny, for which the Offender &s;hall be hanged.</P>
<P>Yet in &s;ome ca&s;es it is not nece&s;|&s;ary that the thing whereof the par|ty is robbed be actually taken from his per&s;on, for if the Robbers ob|tain it by force and menaces, though the owner him&s;elf delivers it to
<PB N="2" REF="7">them, yet this tantamounts to a ta|king from the per&s;on; for the Law re&s;pects the original cau&s;e <HI>(viz.)</HI> the threats and menaces which ne|ce&s;&s;itated the Propriator to quit his goods for the pre&s;ervation of his life and per&s;on; As if one com|mand another pre&s;ently to deliver him his pur&s;e, or otherwi&s;e he will kill him, which he does according|ly, this is Robbery, for the danger he confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to be in by rea|&s;on of tho&s;e threatnings was the cau&s;e and motive of that delivery; So if two or more take a man and by force compell him to take an Oath to bring them &s;uch a &s;um of money, and if he does not they threaten to kill him; Though he brings it in pur&s;uance of his Oath, and delivers it to them and they take it, yet this is Robbery, not|with&s;tanding that by this inforced Oath he was not bound in con&s;ci|ence to bring them the money; for he took it for fear of death, and &s;o not voluntarily; If Felons come in the night to rob me in my hou&s;e, and I, fearing le&s;t they &s;hould enter
<PB N="3" REF="7">the hou&s;e and rob me, and, to pre|vent their entry, I throw money or plate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> out at the window to them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">44 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3.14.</NOTE> which they take and de|part, this is Robbery; for, in con|&s;truction of Law, it is the &s;ame as if they had taken it from my per|&s;on.</P>
<P>If Felons take goods openly in a place where the Owner is pre&s;ent, and thereby put him in fear, or take his hor&s;e or drive his cattel out of his pa&s;ture or fold, he &s;tan|ding by and looking on them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>22</HI> A&s;&s; p. <HI>39.</HI> Fit. Car. <HI>115.</HI></NOTE> &s;o that he be terrified by their vio|lent carriage, menaces, a&s;&s;aults or otherwi&s;e, this is Robbery in the takers, and the Law &s;uppo&s;es it to be done with &s;uch violence that he is not able nor dare not to re&s;i&s;t them, <HI>&amp; in privata cau&s;a nemo tene|tur exponere &s;e periculis.</HI></P>
<P>The putting the party in fear is an e&s;pecial part of a Robbery, with|out which, in e&s;timation of Law, no Robbery can be committed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">5 <HI>Eliz. Dier</HI> 224.</NOTE> for if I be travelling upon the road, and one comes by and takes my money from my pocket, or my &s;word from
<PB N="4" REF="8">my &s;ide unknown to me, this is Felo|ny but no Robbery.</P>
<P>The taking away of &s;omething from the per&s;on, either in Fact or Law, is as nece&s;&s;ary an ingredient to make a Robbery as the Putting of the party in fear; As if one lies in wait in the high-way to rob pa&s;|&s;engers, and he bids a Traveller which comes along to &s;tand and yield him his pur&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9 <HI>Ed.</HI> 4.26.</NOTE> if the Travel|ler upon re&s;i&s;tance overcome him, and either apprehends him or puts him to flight, though there was a de&s;ign and an attempt to commit a Robbery, yet, <HI>volunt as non reputa|bitur pro facto,</HI> and though the Law adjudges this intent to be no Rob|bery, yet it ranks it, and that not unde&s;erved, among&s;t the highe&s;t of mi&s;demeanours.</P>
<P>So that the difference betwixt Robbery and a Theft is that, That one is done openly and with force, the other &s;ecretly and &s;urreptitiou&s;|ly; And if any thing be taken from a man openly and in his pre&s;ence, and his per&s;on is not thereby put in fear, this amounts onely to a tre&s;pa&s;s.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="8">
<P>A Traveller may ju&s;tifie the kil|ling of any per&s;on who &s;hall at|tempt to rob or murther him upon the way, and that without the for|feiture of either lands, goods or chattels;<NOTE PLACE="marg">22 <HI>A&s;&s;.</HI> 55.26 <HI>A&s;&s;. p.</HI> 23. <HI>&amp;</HI> 32. <HI>Co.</HI> li. 5.91. <HI>Fit. Coron.</HI> 30. <HI>&amp;</HI> 305.</NOTE> This point of the forfei|ture was &s;omewhat di&s;putable at the Common Law; Some would have it to be the &s;ame with killing of a man by chance-medly, or <HI>&s;e defen|dendo;</HI> but this point hath been cleared by an explanatory Act made in the 24 <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>cap.</HI> 5. where it is declared, <HI>That if any per&s;on or per|&s;ons do attempt feloniou&s;ly to rob or murther any per&s;on or per&s;ons in or nigh any common high-way, cart-way, hor&s;e-way or foot-way, and if any &s;uch evil di&s;po&s;ed per&s;on happen to be kil|led or &s;lain in &s;uch attempt, and he that &s;o killed him be thereof indicted or appealed, That the per&s;on or per|&s;ons &s;o indicted or appealed, and of the &s;ame by verdict &s;o found and tri|ed, &s;hall not forfeit or lo&s;e any lands, tenements, goods or chattels, for the death of any &s;uch evil di&s;po|&s;ed per&s;on in &s;uch manner &s;lain, but &s;hall be thereof and for the &s;ame fully
<PB N="6" REF="9">acquitted and di&s;charged, in like man|ner as the &s;ame per&s;on or per&s;ons &s;hould be, if he or they were lawfully acquitted of the death of &s;uch evil di&s;po&s;ed per&s;on or per&s;ons.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Where and how the party is to have re&s;titution of the goods whereof he was robbed, upon an Appeal or Indictment.</HEAD>
<P>AT the Common Law, before the Statute of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> the per&s;on robbed had no other &s;atis|faction but onely re&s;titution of his goods, in ca&s;e he made fre&s;h pur|&s;uit after the Robber, and convic|ted him at his own Suit <HI>(viz.)</HI> by an Appeal of Robbery. The Law is &s;o eager to have Felons apprehen|ded, that if the party does not u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours to get the Offender taken, it puni&s;heth him with the lo&s;s and forfeiture of the goods &s;tolen; So that if the Male|factor be convicted at the Suit of the party, yet if the Jury does not
<PB N="7" REF="9">find that he had made fre&s;h &s;uit af|ter the Felon, the goods &s;toln are forfeited to the King, and no re&s;ti|tution can be made of them.</P>
<P>As the Law condemns the not pur&s;uing or in &s;lack and faint pur|&s;uit of Robbers; &s;o it rewardeth diligent endeavours though they meet with no &s;ucce&s;s: for if a Fe|lon which committed a Robbery be not taken by the &s;pace of a year after the Felony committed, yet if the party that was robbed doe his endeavour to apprehend the Felon, and make diligent and &s;pecial en|quiry for him, and after he be ta|ken, though not at the &s;uit of the party robbed, yet that &s;hall be ad|judged a &s;ufficient fre&s;h &s;uit, and upon his appeal brought, and the Offender convicted, he &s;hall have re&s;titution of his goods robbed; and if this fre&s;h &s;uit was made by a Servant, and not by the party rob|bed him&s;elf, it is &s;ufficient to pro|cure him re&s;titution.</P>
<P>Conviction without Attainder is &s;ufficient to entitle the Appealant to a re&s;titution, though in ancient
<PB N="8" REF="10">times &s;ome opinions have been to the contrary, and that no re&s;titu|tion could be made untill after at|tainder, and in &s;ome ca&s;es where no attainder could be (as where the Felon died in pri&s;on before the Owner had commenced his appeal) though the &s;uit was never &s;o fre&s;h, <HI>Fit. Coron.</HI> 319.8 <HI>E.</HI> 3.10. But now it is agreed that if after the appeal commenced the Felon die in pri&s;on or break the pri&s;on, the fre&s;h &s;uit &s;hall be enquired, and if found, the party robbed &s;hall be re&s;tored to his goods, <HI>Fit. Coron.</HI> 379. 26 <HI>A&s;&s;. p.</HI> 32. So if the Male|factor &s;tand mute or challenge per|emptorily above the number which the Law does allow, or demand his Clergy, in every of the&s;e ca&s;es the fre&s;h &s;uit being found by inque&s;t, the Appealant &s;hall have re&s;titution of his goods, for he had done all that he could in order to an attainder.</P>
<P>If an appeal of Robbery be &s;ued again&s;t the Principal and Acce&s;&s;ory, and the Principal be attainted and the fre&s;h &s;uit is &s;ound, re&s;titution &s;hall be made of the &s;toln goods
<PB N="9" REF="10">without pro&s;ecuting the &s;uit again&s;t the Acce&s;&s;ory, and yet his continu|ance of the &s;uit again&s;t the Acce&s;&s;o|ry &s;hall not hinder his re&s;titution, for that the principal Felon is at|tainted by his procurement; and the Appealant &s;hall have re&s;titution whether the Acce&s;&s;ory be attainted or acquitted; In the &s;ame manner the Appealant &s;hall have re&s;titution where he &s;ues an appeal again&s;t two as Principals and one of them is ac|quitted, 21. <HI>Ed.</HI> 4.16. 10 <HI>H.</HI> 4.5. If one man rob divers men, for which they bring their &s;everal ap|peals, and the Felon is attainted at the &s;uit of one of them, and the fre&s;h &s;uit is found, in this ca&s;e the re&s;t &s;hall not have re&s;titution untill the Offender be convicted at their &s;everal &s;uits, and likewi&s;e the fre&s;h &s;uit &s;everally found.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome opinions which hold that if the Appealant &s;ue the Robber to the outlawry that he &s;hall have re&s;titution of his goods without enquiring of the fre&s;h &s;uit, for that he had pro&s;ecuted again&s;t the Appealee as far as the Law gave him way.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="11">
<P>An enquiry mu&s;t be made of the fre&s;h &s;uit before any re&s;titution can be awarded; and that too before the Ju&s;tices and not the Sheriff, and by the Jury that convicted the De|fendant of the Robbery: But in ca&s;e the Defendant doth confe&s;s the appeal, then it mu&s;t be enquired of by a <HI>Vi&s;ne</HI> from that County where the Robbery was committed, and where the appeal is brought, ex|cept it be brought in <HI>London;</HI> for that the City hath a privilege not to be forced to appear upon Juries out of the City; And it cannot be taken there by <HI>Ni&s;i Prius,</HI> becau&s;e it is but an inque&s;t of Office; Therefore in this ca&s;e the <HI>Vi&s;ne</HI> &s;hall come from that County where the Robber was taken, and &s;o it &s;hall be enquired by the people of that County.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place the Court is to ask the Defendant in the appeal if he claims any property in the goods; which if he &s;ays he does not, then it mu&s;t be enquired if the goods were the Plaintiff's at the time of the Robbery committed,
<PB N="11" REF="11">and al&s;o enquire of the fre&s;h &s;uit.</P>
<P>If the Manner (<HI>viz.</HI> the &s;toln goods) wherewith the Felon is ta|ken be portable, or that it can be otherwi&s;e done with conveniency, it ought to be brought into the Court before the Ju&s;tices, and if it be in a trunk, box, che&s;t or cloak-bag, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Appealant mu&s;t tell particularly what goods there are in it before it be opened, or that he can have re&s;titution.</P>
<P>The Appealant's fre&s;h &s;uit being found by the Inque&s;t, the Court ought to award him re&s;titution of all the goods contained in his ap|peal, which the King's Officers or any other had &s;ei&s;ed to the King's u&s;e.</P>
<P>Having &s;hewed how the party robbed might obtain re&s;titution of his goods by Appeal, in the next place falls under con&s;ideration the ca&s;e of an Indictment: At Com|mon Law, if the per&s;on robbed had &s;teered his cour&s;e this way he had certainly &s;plit him&s;elf upon the rocks; for re&s;titution could in no
<PB N="12" REF="12">ca&s;e be awarded upon an Indictment, though the Jury that found the Of|fender guilty of the Robbery had likewi&s;e found the fre&s;h Suit. To remedy this inconveniency an Act was made 21 <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>cap.</HI> 18. whereby it was enacted, <HI>That if any Felon or Felons do rob or take away money, goods or chattels from any of the King's Sub|jects, from their per&s;on or otherwi&s;e within this Realm, and thereof the &s;aid Felon or Felons be indicted, and after arraigned of the &s;ame Felony and found guilty thereof, or otherwi&s;e attainted by rea&s;on of evidence given by the party robbedd or owner of the &s;aid money, goods and chattels, that as well Ju&s;tices of Goal delivery, as other Ju&s;tices before whom any &s;uch Felon or Felons &s;hall be found guilty or other|wi&s;e attainted by rea&s;on of evidence given by the party &s;o robbed or owner, or by any other by their procurement, have power by this Act to award from time to time Writs of re&s;titution for the &s;aid money, goods or chattels in like manner as though any &s;uch Felon or Felons were attainted at the Suit of the party in appeal:</HI> So that by
<PB N="13" REF="12">virtue of this Act the party robbed may have re&s;titution upon evidence given by him&s;elf or by any other by his procurement notwith&s;tan|ding that he made not any fre&s;h Suit.</P>
<P>If the Servant be robbed of his Ma&s;ter's goods, the Ma&s;ter may give evidence again&s;t the Felon by virtue of the&s;e words <HI>(the party &s;o robbed or owner)</HI> And if the party robbed does not give evidence him|&s;elf but procure another to doe it, this is &s;ufficient within the words of the Statute to enable him to obtain re&s;titution.</P>
<P>If one man do rob goods from three men &s;everally, and he is in|dicted for the robbing of one of them, and thereupon arraigned; though the other two would give evidence again&s;t the Malefactor, yet they &s;hall not have re&s;titution of their goods within the intent and meaning of this Act, for the Felon is not attainted of any other Robbery but that whereof he is in|dicted: But if he be indicted of all the three &s;everal Robberies &s;eve|rally,
<PB N="14" REF="13">and arraigned upon one of them, and convicted upon the evi|dence given by one of the parties robbed, yet he &s;hall be after ar|raigned upon the other two Indict|ments that he may be al&s;o found guilty by the evidence of the other two per&s;ons robbed; to the end they may have re&s;titution of their goods.</P>
<P>Though this Statute &s;peak onely of the party robbed, yet his Exe|cutors and Admini&s;trators are with|in the meaning of it: for it is a be|neficial Law, and gives a more &s;pee|dy remedy to the party robbed than the Common Law gave by way of Indictment, and therefore ought to be con&s;trued beneficially.</P>

At Com|mon Law, if a man was robbed, he was pre&s;ently to u&s;e his utmo&s;t en|deavour to apprehend the Felon, and if he was found defective or negligent in this particular, the Law would give him no relief; and though there was no neglect in him, yet for want of the due and &s;peedy a&s;&s;i&s;tance of others, which were o|bliged to joyn with him in the pur|&s;uit, perhaps the Robber was not taken untill &s;uch time as he had op|portunity to make away and im|bezle the goods; So that if it chan|ced that he was taken afterwards, the party was de&s;titute of any &s;ort of recompence, whereas if the Fe|lon had been fre&s;hly and vigorou&s;ly pur&s;ued from Town to Town, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the Law does direct and require, he might have been taken with the Manner, and upon an Appeal brought and a conviction there|upon, the Owner was to have re|&s;titution of the goods which were
<PB N="16" REF="14">&s;toln from him. It is true the Law did puni&s;h the Inhabitants of the place where the Robbery was com|mitted, if, upon notice given to the Con&s;table of the Town, the Huy and Cry was not rai&s;ed, and all per&s;ons within the Town were bound to follow the pur&s;uit, which if they did not they were puni&s;h|able by Fine and Impri&s;onment, this Cry was to be carried from Con|&s;table to Con&s;table; and if any Town was indicted for the e&s;cape of the Felon, the pur&s;uit with Huy and Cry to the next Con&s;table was a good excu&s;e, a total neglect or at lea&s;t the faint and weak perfor|mance of the&s;e fre&s;h &s;uits being not duly puni&s;hed, Robbers did e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed, and that impunity was an encouragement to others to commit the like enormities, to the great and manife&s;t danger of the King's Subjects travelling upon their lawfull occa&s;ions. For the indemp|nity of per&s;ons who &s;hould &s;u&s;tain any lo&s;s by Robberies, and for the more effectual obliging of Cities, Towns and Villages, and to di&s;charge
<PB N="17" REF="14">their duty with great care and di|ligence in the pur&s;uing and appre|hending of Felons, it was thought fit a Law &s;hould be made, that if the Felons were not taken within &s;uch a time, the Hundred where the Robbery was committed &s;hould &s;a|tisfie the party whatever he was damnified thereby; to that end there was a Statute made at <HI>Win|che&s;ter,</HI> in the 13 <HI>E.</HI> 1. whereby, in the preamble thereof, is &s;et forth the principal cau&s;e of the frequent e&s;capes of Felons without being ap|prehended, and why the Laws which were then extant proved ineffectu|al to &s;uppre&s;s and extingui&s;h both Felons and Felonies, and whence the growth of them proceeded, for that Felons could not be attainted by the Oaths of Jurors, who had rather &s;trangers &s;hould be robbed and the Robbers e&s;cape puni&s;hment than indict the Offenders, of whom great part were of the &s;ame Coun|try, or at lea&s;t, if the Offenders were of another Country, the Re|farvors might be of places near; and they did this, becau&s;e no Oath
<PB N="18" REF="15">was given to the Jurors of the &s;ame Country where the Felonies were committed, and no Law obliged them to re&s;titution of damages, nor any penalty limited for their concealment and Latches. And for that the fear of a penalty more than that of an Oath might be a grea|ter engagement upon them not to &s;pare or conceal Felonies, therefore it was enacted, 
<Q>That if any Robbe|ry, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be committed (if need re|quires) Inque&s;t &s;hall be made in Towns by him that is Lord of the Town, and after in the Hundred, and in the Franches and in the County, and &s;ome|times in two, three or four Counties, in ca&s;e where Felonies &s;hall be commit|ted in the Marches of Shires.</Q>
And it was further enacted, 
<Q>That if the Country will not an&s;wer for the Bodies of &s;uch Offenders, the people of every &s;uch Country &s;hall be an&s;werable for the Robberies and al&s;o the damages, &s;o that the whole Hundred, with the Franchi&s;es being within the precincts of the &s;ame Hundred, &s;hall be an&s;we|rable for the Robberies done. And if the Robbery be done in the divi&s;ions
<PB N="19" REF="15">of two Hundreds, both the Hundreds and the Franchi&s;es within the &s;ame &s;hall be an&s;werable; And after the Robbery be done, the Country &s;hall have no longer &s;pace than half a year, with|in which time it &s;hall behoove them to agree for the Robbery or Offence, or el&s;e that they &s;hall an&s;wer for the Bo|dies of the Offenders.</Q></P>

<Q>That the Country &s;hall have no longer term after the Robbe|ry committed than forty days, with|in which time they mu&s;t make &s;atis|faction for the Robbery or an&s;wer the Bodies of the Felons.</Q></P>
<P>The per&s;on robbed &s;hall have an Action upon the Statute of <HI>Winche|&s;ter</HI> again&s;t the Hundred, notwith|&s;tanding that the Statute does not expre&s;ly mention any Action; for when it &s;ays the Hundred &s;hall an|&s;wer for the Robbery and the da|mages; the Hundred within the meaning of the Statute is to be an|&s;werable to the party robbed; for he is the per&s;on damnified and in|tended to be relieved within this

<HEAD>Where and how notice is to be given of the Robbery.</HEAD>
<P>IT appears by the Statute of <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter</HI> the 1&s;t, made in the third year of <HI>Edward</HI> the Fir&s;t, That at
<PB N="26" REF="19">Common Law 'twas the duty of the Inhabitants to keep and guard the Country from Thefts and Robbe|ries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and in ca&s;e any Felony was committed they were to pur&s;ue and apprehend the Felons, otherwi&s;e they were puni&s;hable for the e&s;cape of &s;uch Offenders: every Town was obliged at its peril to take notice of any Robbery committed within its precincts, though done (if in the day time) in a place never &s;o &s;ecret;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dier</HI> 210. pl. 25.</NOTE> as if a man be &s;lain in the Fields or Lane or any other private place belonging to the Town, if the Murtherer e&s;cape untaken, the Town was amerceable, though the Inhabitants thereof had not the lea&s;t knowledge of it, for in many ca&s;es the Law doth pre&s;ume a know|ledge, as the Jury that is to try an I&s;&s;ue is &s;uppo&s;ed to have recogni|zance of the matter of fact in I&s;&s;ue between the parties; So if one be outlawed of Felony in the County-Court, and afterwards is received by any per&s;on of the &s;ame County, that receipt makes him acce&s;&s;ary to the Felony, for the Law believes
<PB N="27" REF="19">no man, re&s;iding in the &s;ame Coun|ty, to be ignorant of what is tran&s;|acted in that Court; to which ge|nerally every one owes &s;uit and at|tendance. Likewi&s;e if one retain my Servant in the &s;ame County where I live, if I bring an Action again&s;t him for &s;o doing, his igno|rance of the fact in this ca&s;e does not excu&s;e him, for he is bound to take notice of the fir&s;t retainder, but if he retains my Servant in a|nother County, then the Law is otherwi&s;e; So al&s;o a man is bound to take notice of all Acts done up|on his own freehold. The Statute of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> which give the Acti|on again&s;t the Hundred, is general, and does not &s;pecifie any time or place when or where the Robbery is to be done, which makes the Hundred liable, yet the Sages of the Law have put &s;uch a con&s;truc|tion upon the general words of that Statute, that the Robbery, which binds the Country to render &s;atis|faction to the party robbed, mu&s;t be committed in the day-time, and not in the night, and not in a pri|vate
<PB N="28" REF="20">place as a Hou&s;e, but openly, &s;o that the Country may take no|tice of it them&s;elves,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Co.</HI> li. 7. &s;o. 7.</NOTE> for it was not nece&s;&s;ary for him that was robbed to levy any Huy and Cry, or give any notice of the Robbery to the Inhabitants of the Country, nei|ther by the letter of the fore&s;aid Statute of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> or by the meaning of it; for it may be that the per&s;on robbed was bound or maimed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;o that he could not rai&s;e any Huy and Cry or give any notice to the Country, and it is a general Rule in Law, that where the Law appoints no per&s;on to give notice, the party concerned him&s;elf is bound to take notice at his peril; as if a Church becomes void, by vir|tue of the Statute of the 21&s;t. of <HI>Hen.</HI> 8. the Patron is bound to pre|&s;ent at his peril within, &s;ix months after the in&s;titution and induction into the &s;econd Benefice,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cro.</HI> par. 1.258.</NOTE> though all this be done without his having the lea&s;t knowledge of it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dier <HI>292.</HI></NOTE> But if a Church becomes void by &s;entence of deprivation in the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Court, and the &s;ix months after

<PB N="33" REF="22">the Robbery, it were too hard to require from them a performance of that which they are deprived of the ordinary and convenient means to effect. This Statute was expoun|ded according to the rule and rea|&s;on of the Common Law (as it may appear by the ca&s;e of the 3d. of <HI>Ed.</HI> 3d.

<P>In this point of the time there is a difference between a pur&s;uit for the King and for the party, upon the Statute, as &s;hall be further de|mon&s;trated hereafter, when I come to treat of Huy and Cry; though in neither ca&s;e the Law does con|&s;train the Country to take cogni|zance at their peril of any Felony acted in the night:<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 <HI>Ed.</HI> 4.8.

As if a man
<PB N="34" REF="23">be robbed or a&s;&s;aulted and offered to be robbed, either in the day or night, if the per&s;on him&s;elf or any other re&s;ort to the Con&s;table of the Town, and acquaint him with the ca&s;es, de&s;cribing the per&s;on, and giving information which way the Offender is gone, and require him to rai&s;e the Huy and Cry, it is the duty of the Con&s;table to rai&s;e the power of the Town, as well in the night as in the day, for the pro&s;ecu|tion of the Offender, and if he be not found, there to give warning to the next Con&s;table, and he to the next, untill the Offender be taken.</P>
<P>If a Traveller be robbed in the night, and gives notice to the Con|&s;table of the Village as afore&s;aid, though the Con&s;table is obliged (as I have &s;aid already) to rai&s;e the Huy and Cry, yet this at the mo&s;t is but a pur&s;uit for the King, and the Traveller &s;hall take no advan|tage of the negligence thereof, in ca&s;e the Felons make their e&s;cape, for God hath ordained the day for man to labour and travel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Co. ubi &s;u|pra.</NOTE> as a fit

It is true,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10 <HI>Ed.</HI> 3. fo. 21.</NOTE> a man may di&s;train for damage Fea&s;ant in the night, and the Law does allow it onely for the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, for if the Owner of the Land &s;hould permit the Cattel to continue there
<PB N="36" REF="24">till morning, perhaps by that time they may e&s;tray out of the ground, and &s;o they cannot be di&s;trained at all, for they mu&s;t be taken damage fea&s;ant <HI>(viz.)</HI> doing of the tre&s;pa&s;s upon the ground. Therefore &s;ince none are bound to have an eye in the night upon Thieves and Rob|bers in the Country, it is both the intere&s;t and &s;afety of our Travel|ler, that he take care not to be a|broad at un&s;ea&s;onable hours, for then in &s;ome re&s;pect he is out of the protection of the Law, which makes no provi&s;ion for his indemp|nity in ca&s;e he be robbed, and the Poet further warns him of his dan|ger:</P>

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. For that the Owner of the Land through which the new way was made might &s;top it at his plea&s;ure.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Becau&s;e if any Robbery &s;hould happen to be committed upon any per&s;on travelling in this new way, the Country was not liable to make &s;atisfaction for it, for that they were not bound to keep Watch

<P>THere are two &s;orts of Huy and Cry, The one by Common Law, the other by Statute. The Huy and Cry by Common Law may be levied by any per&s;on who finds ju&s;t cau&s;e to doe it; neither when a Felony is committed is it nece&s;&s;ary for him to re&s;ort to the Con&s;table of the Town where it was done, and acquaint him with the cau&s;e, de&s;cribing the per&s;on, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and re|quire him to begin it, but that ei|ther the party grieved or one that is eye Witne&s;s to the fact may rai&s;e the Huy and Cry them&s;elves, and the people of the Town are bound to follow it when it is once &s;o rai&s;ed, and if the party does not &s;o he incurs the penalty of the Law. For if a man be pre&s;ent when one is either robbed or murthered,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>3</HI> In&s;t. <HI>117. 8</HI> Ed. <HI>2.</HI> Coron. <HI>395.</HI></NOTE> and does not endeavour to arre&s;t the Offender, he is puni&s;hable by Fine
<PB N="69" REF="40">and impri&s;onment; And &s;o was the Law of old, <HI>Siquis aliquem &s;poliatum viderit, &s;ontem per acela|mationem in&s;equatur,</HI> and it is like|wi&s;e to be found among&s;t the Laws of <HI>Carnutus</HI> that if a man met a Robber in the way,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3 <HI>In&s;t.</HI> 116.</NOTE> and would &s;uf|fer him to pa&s;s without rai&s;ing the Huy and Cry upon him, he was to pay the uttermo&s;t penny the Felons life &s;hould be valued at.</P>
<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary that the Huy and Cry be made by the Con&s;table, the party grieved, or him that &s;aw the fact committed, nor that it be rai&s;ed in the Town where the Fe|lony was done, but that in all ca|&s;es where every man has authority by a warrant in Law to arre&s;t an Offender, as a man attainted or in|dicted of Trea&s;on or Felony, may be apprehended by any per&s;on what&s;oever, if an attempt be made to arre&s;t any &s;uch per&s;on and he di&s;obeys it and flies, the Huy and Cry may be levied upon him where ever he be.</P>
