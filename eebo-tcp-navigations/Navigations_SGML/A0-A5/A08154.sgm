<HEAD>A TRVE RELATION OF THE DAILY CONFLICTS, and proceedings betweene the great Turkes Armie, and his Maie&s;tie of POLAND, <HI>to the end of the Warres.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THere &s;hall neede no preamble, nor in&s;inuation to this di&s;|cour&s;e, more then that you haue had already a publi&s;hed Pamph|let of the newes of Poland, &s;hewing plainely the occa&s;ion of the Turkes formidable pre|paration again&s;t that Country, with his de&s;cending in per&s;on into Walachia, and comming to many skirmi&s;hes and battailes, afford|ing as many rumors of the &s;euerall euents and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es in the &s;ame; in&s;omuch that many reported Poland was ouer-runne, and <HI>Sigi&s;mond</HI> &s;laine: Yet there is but one truth which that booke in generall &s;ets out: yet &s;o farre &s;hort of &s;atisfaction, that it comes not neere any particular indeede, whereby men went away, as if they had onely looked on the outward painting and brauery of a hou&s;e, without once being admitted to ouer-looke, how nece&s;&s;ary
<PB N="2" REF="3"> and conuenient it was in the inward roomes. There|fore I will promi&s;e you amends, though in a plaine fa&s;hion, and this relation &s;hall &s;upply the defects of the other. For I will pre&s;ently come to the pur|po&s;e, and begin with the beginning of September: after the Polacks had entrenched them&s;elues, and the Turkes and Tartars came as neere them as might be.</P>
<P>Know then, that the &s;econd of September <HI>&s;tilo no|u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> the Turkes and Tartars encamped them&s;elues by vs within a mile, or halfe a mile, and the &s;ame day began hotly vpon vs, brauing our trenches, which we would not endure, but came to blowes, and made a skirmi&s;h, in which eight hundred Turks peri&s;hed, as by many Captiues and Pri&s;oners, which we tooke in the flight, was afterward confe&s;&s;ed, be&s;ides &s;uch as were &s;laine neere hand in the charges, and farre off with the Bullets, both of our field Peeces and Mu&s;|katieres: on our &s;ide peri&s;hed <HI>Tarouits</HI> and <HI>Bochdan,</HI> two Commaunders of Light-hor&s;e, and the Lord <HI>Lauizza</HI> of the Cohort of the Camp-Ma&s;ter, was &s;hot in the foot with a great Bullet, two Ma&s;ters of the be&s;t men of Armes &s;laine, and aboue 30. other of &s;euerall Companies hurt.</P>
<P>The third of September, they proceeded in the &s;ame manner, and we with &s;ome light excur&s;ions &s;et vpon them, till at la&s;t they bur&s;t out in three &s;euerall parts again&s;t our trenches, e&s;pecially where our Co&s;&s;acks were quartred, and &s;o came to the very out-skirts of our Poli&s;h Army, who had command to keepe them&s;elues within their Tents and Tren|ches,
<PB N="3" REF="3"> and annoy the Turkes with their great Artil|lery, and &s;o we pro&s;pered for that time, driuing them into their Campe, wherein by Sunne-&s;etting they quickly retired: the &s;ame euening our noble Prince pa&s;&s;ed ouer the Riuer, and came into our Campe with all manner of comfort and courage, but the Army he brought with him, with proui&s;ion of war|like Ordnance, and other Munition nece&s;&s;ary for vs, could not come at vs, by rea&s;on the Bridge brake by the force of the water, which not three dayes before they had builded vp and erected.</P>
<P>The fourth of September, by the Sunne ri&s;ing, the Emperour of Turkes, would needs in per&s;on be a beholder of the skirmi&s;h, and &s;o in a manner ap|proched the Campe of the Co&s;&s;acks, bringing ma|ny field Peeces, and mounting &s;uch, which they call <HI>Ian&s;charki,</HI> and &s;o a great battaile began, which la|&s;ted full fiue houres: For the Co&s;&s;acks much en|damnified by the Artillary, made &s;o braue a &s;alley vpon the Turkes, that they draue them backe by maine force, and put a number of them to the &s;word, in&s;omuch that they altered their determination, and brought their <HI>Ianskarks</HI> before the quarter, where the Camp-Ma&s;ter was lodged, but here it was too hot for them: and it did not &s;ucceed, as they expected, &s;o they charged the Co&s;&s;acks once againe, riding by our trenches in a brauing manner, and comming vp|on them with an in&s;ulting violence, which yet pro&s;|pered not, as they expected: whereupon not an houre before Sunne &s;etting, they charged them more violently, but God was our defence at this
<PB N="4" REF="4"> time: For the Co&s;&s;acks made &s;o braue a &s;alley, that they put the Turkes to flight euen to their Tents, with &s;uch a &s;laughter, and &s;uch a &s;ucce&s;&s;e, that they &s;urpri&s;ed their Artillery, tooke many Tents, and ca|ried with them much furniture, and &s;o returned be|fore dark night with the booty, to their own Camp and lodging.</P>
<P>The fift of December, we were quiet on both &s;ides: For the Turkes remoued their quarter a little more backward, yet with full re&s;olution to &s;et vpon vs againe, as by many pri&s;oners we tooke was con|fe&s;&s;ed: whereupon we fell to our accu&s;tomed pray|ers to God, and about noone there fell a raine, and &s;o there was nothing attempted that day, but that we prepared our &s;elues for the expugnation.</P>
<P>The &s;ixt of September, there fled vnto vs a Co&s;|&s;ack, one of the inhabitants by the riuer of Danu|bius, who had beene &s;eauen yeare in &s;eruitude with the Turkes, and affirmed, that there were &s;laine 2000. Iani&s;&s;aries in the la&s;t skirmi&s;hes, and expu|puation of our Camp; that the great Turke him|&s;elfe would lead the whole Army in per&s;on, except &s;uch as he mu&s;t needs leaue for the defence of his Camp, and the &s;ecurity of his cattell: that already there began to be a great dearth among&s;t them. For foure pound of bread was worth 24. A&s;pers of &s;il|uer, and a quantity of Barly or other Corne, equal|ling the halfe bu&s;hell of the mea&s;ure of Camenen&s;is, was valued at &s;eauen Florins, and 15. A&s;pers, and that many di&s;contents appeared among&s;t them al|ready. The &s;ame day there came al&s;o vnto vs a
<PB N="5" REF="4"> Dutch man, who had falne into the hands of the Turkes, as a pri&s;oner with a Captaine of the Co&s;|&s;acks, and he a&s;&s;ured vs that on Friday <HI>A&s;is Ba&s;&s;aw,</HI> a man of great reputation among the Turkes, was &s;truck in the forehead with a Bullet, and &s;o &s;laine; and that &s;o many Turkes were ouerthrowne in the la&s;t &s;euerall on-&s;ets vpon the Co&s;&s;acks, that they began to flye euery where from their quarter and Cabbines: he al&s;o related the cau&s;e, why the Turks were &s;o quiet, which was by rea&s;on of a larges, or donation of money the Turke be&s;towed vpon &s;uch, who had behaued them&s;elues well in the la&s;t enter|pri&s;e, preparing for new a&s;&s;aults: and this was the truth of the matter.</P>
<P>The &s;eauenth of September the Turkes came vp|on vs againe in the after noone, and very outragi|ou&s;ly in great companies a&s;&s;aulted our Bulwarkes, which were yet vnperfected, and lay &s;omewhat naked to oppo&s;ition, a&s;cending the &s;ame, and ta|king as it were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: but with equall lo&s;&s;e, as it appeared for the time, vntill the noble Lord <HI>Steward</HI> of the Kingdome, who came there by chance with his troope of Hor&s;e, &s;et vpon them mo&s;t valiantly, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Lord <HI>Ca&s;tellano Plocen,</HI> and <HI>P. Radomina,</HI> put them off the walls to a fore-flight, as farre as the wood &s;cited euen before the Turkes Campe, whether they fol|lowed them in the &s;laughter: as for &s;uch Turkes as at fir&s;t dared to approach our Trenches, and &s;cale our Mounts, they all peri&s;hed vpon them, we not loo&s;ing aboue twelue men of Armes in that
<PB N="6" REF="5"> &s;eruice, with &s;ome few other hurt, except <HI>Ca&s;tella|nus Plocen,</HI> who with many wounds returned, and died the next day: But the a&s;&s;ault again&s;t the Co&s;|&s;acks endured from noone to night; ours onely la&s;ted from the after-noone to Sunne &s;etting, yet both continued with &s;o fearefull effects, that the multitude of the &s;laughtred was apparant, and the Enemies carka&s;&s;es lay in heapes in the fields: Yea, it was remarkeable, how all that night the Turks made a &s;earch with lighted fire-brands, and other Lamps, for &s;ome per&s;on of account among&s;t the dead bodies, which as &s;ome of their owne fugi|tiues affirmed, was one of the <HI>Viceer Ba&s;&s;as,</HI> who was mi&s;&s;ing, and could not be found.</P>
<P>The eighth of September, there e&s;caped out of the Turkes hands a Co&s;&s;ack, who had long laine in fetters, he came to vs by night, and tolde vs plaine|ly, that the Turkes had loaden many Cammels with the encumbrances of the Army, and furni|&s;hed the cariage Hor&s;es, as if they meant to make &s;ome retreat: notwith&s;tanding, the &s;ame day very incon&s;iderately they came vpon the Co&s;&s;acks a|gaine, who by the helpe of the Germanes now a|mong&s;t them; both defended them&s;elues, and of|fended their Enemies: for here were braue Com|maunders, partly vnder the Regiment and conduct of Captaine <HI>Drhu&s;off,</HI> partly vnder Captaine <HI>Ler|mund,</HI> and of the other &s;ide in the right wing, there were the Cohorts of his Excellency, the Lord <HI>Palatine.</HI> The &s;ame day <HI>Schandactus</HI> cut off by the &s;word, according to the manner and cu&s;tome
<PB N="7" REF="5"> of a Military Court, who adiudged him to die, a principall Captaine of the Co&s;&s;acks, called <HI>Bron|danka,</HI> who the yeare before had abu&s;ed his prero|gatiue, and mo&s;t peruer&s;ly by factious deui&s;es, and apparant thefts, had tran&s;cended the gouernment of a Commaunder in chiefe, and falne to thefts and robberies more then nece&s;&s;ity, or the pre&s;ent wants enforced.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day a certaine Squire e&s;caped out of the hands of the Turkes, who was vnfortunately taken pri&s;oner at a battaile in Cicora, and came vnto vs, affirming confidently, that &s;ince the Turkes comming into the field, there are dimini|&s;hed at lea&s;t twelue thou&s;and of their number, &s;ome &s;laine out-right, &s;ome dying of their woundes, &s;ome &s;urpri&s;ed in the Campe, and &s;ome flying away.</P>
<P>The ninth of September, the great Turke after noone drew out all his Army in battaile array: which Lord <HI>Magnus</HI> our Generall perceiuing, de|tracted no time, but prepared for the fight: &s;o that both Armies euen to Sunne &s;etting, &s;tood loo|king vpon one another, without any mans giuing the &s;igne of the battaile, not daring to approach too neere the fortifications, and Bulwarkes of our Tren|ches; but &s;tood as remote as they could, and far|the&s;t from danger. In the meane while, the Iani|zaries fell foule vpon the quarter of the Co&s;&s;acks againe, and continued little le&s;&s;e then foure houres in a dangerous skirmi&s;h: For the Ger|manes playing their part on the other &s;ide, as
<PB N="8" REF="6"> a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Co&s;&s;acks in their Warre-like excur|&s;ions, quickly, when they pre&s;&s;ed them with fury and impetuo&s;ity, compelled them backe to their Campe, and wee returned to our Trenches: But the &s;ame night another pri&s;oner e&s;caped, and came vnto vs, affirming that of the Spahies, who were the forwarde&s;t in this expugnation, as &s;o com|maunded by the Captaine of the Ianizaries, lo&s;t two hundred of their Company, and of the Iani|zaries were &s;laine, with &s;uch as peri&s;hed in the flight 1500.</P>
<P>The tenth of September, the Turkes were &s;ome|what quiet, as peraduenture wearied with the for|mer dayes mi&s;chiefe, and we farre apparant the va|rious chances of Warre, and the wonderfull e&s;&s;ects of a Battaile.</P>
<P>The eleuenth of September, the Turkes made a new apparance out of their Tents, with a good|ly Army: and wee were not behinde to Mar&s;hall our Companies to as braue a &s;how: but nothing was done that day, and &s;o wee returned on all &s;ides to lodging: yet while wee remained in this expectation, the Turkes had tran&s;ported their Ordnance to the other &s;ide of the Riuer, from whence hee played continually into the quarters of the Co&s;&s;acks all that day: but when hee &s;aw, they did them no more harme, hee quickly drew them backe againe; and placed them more &s;e|curely: The &s;ame day, &s;ome thou&s;ands of Tar|tars &s;hewed them&s;elues on that &s;ide of the Riuer al&s;o; who with their accu&s;tomed clamours and
<PB N="9" REF="6"> out-cry, attempted the breaking of our Bridge: but onely two hundred foot, whereof one was kil|led, and two hurt with Bullet, pre&s;&s;ed vpon them with &s;uch volleyes of &s;hot, that they were quickly put to flight. God graunt wee may be thankfull for the&s;e things. For without controuer&s;ie, Gods onely hand hath protected vs, that both on the one &s;ide the Turke is more remi&s;&s;e then his former threatnings, and this pre&s;ent appearance promi|&s;ed; and we on the other &s;ide we haue had greater courages, and better &s;ucce&s;&s;e then wee could any manner of way expect.</P>
<P>The twelfth of September, a little after mid|night, wee determined to &s;et vpon the Campe of our Aduer&s;aries, leauing our noble Prince &s;uffici|ently guarded within the Trenches, as not well at ea&s;e, and &s;o the Army deuided it &s;elfe into parts, hauing in&s;tructions to come vpon them vnawares: the one to compa&s;&s;e the Woods, and &s;et vpon them in the reare, and at their backes: the other to out-face them in the front and &s;ides, that &s;ome|thing might be done euery way. But it plea&s;ed God to &s;end &s;o great a &s;hower of raine, that wee were diuerted from our purpo&s;es at this time: but I make no que&s;tion of a better opportunity, and that our Aduer&s;aries little knew of this pro|iect, and &s;o wee may once againe &s;ee the &s;trata|gem on foot, till when wee retired to our Tren|ches &s;ecurely.</P>
<P>The 15. of September, the Turkes and Tartars,
<PB N="10" REF="7"> with a great re&s;olution and impetuous a&s;&s;ault, pre&s;|&s;ed both vpon vs, and the Co&s;&s;acks in three &s;euerall partes, neither fearing our Artillery, nor making accompt of our Trenches: the great Turke him&s;elfe being a &s;pectator on an eminent Hill, who&s;e youth apprehended the mi&s;chiefe but as a &s;port. For with|out any manner of remorce for the peri&s;hing of &s;o many thou&s;ands, they came forward like furious bea&s;ts without Di&s;cipline or order, and &s;o peri&s;hed like Bea&s;ts, when the Artillery played vpon them, and wee ru&s;hed out as violently well armed and ap|pointed in the &s;moake again&s;t them, this Battaile la&s;ted from Noone to Night, and the God of Bat|tailes for his mercy &s;ake, did fru&s;trate and annihilate both the purpo&s;e and the rage and fury of our Ene|mies, nor ended it &s;o, but for his Glories &s;ake wee preuailed with a great &s;laughter, and little lo&s;&s;e on our &s;ide: So that it &s;hould &s;eeme all their threat|ning and fury was in vaine, concerning the attemp|ting of our Trenches, and the Angels of the Lord &s;pred his winges ouer our Tents: On the other &s;ide our Souldiers were &s;o couragious, and animated, as infu&s;ed with new Spirits from the &s;ame God, that they not onely ru&s;hed out of the portes and pa&s;&s;a|ges of their Quarters vpon their Enemies, but hur|ried ouer the Trenches and Ditches to forward the enterpri&s;e, and &s;o came to handiblowes, and with extraordinary valour and &s;laughter &s;ent them home againe.</P>
<P>In this Skirmi&s;h we did not altogether goe &s;cot|free, but &s;aw the peri&s;hing of thou&s;ands of Turkes
<PB N="11" REF="7"> and Tartars, who&s;e Carka&s;&s;es be&s;pred the ground as it were: and among whome there peri&s;hed the great Ba&s;haw &s;urnamed <HI>Koraken,</HI> who newly came to the Emperour and was mo&s;t deare vnto him, and well accepted of him: the &s;ame Fate and triall had <HI>Na&s;&s;an Ba&s;&s;aw</HI> with many Chaw&s;es and Spahies, and a number vnnumbred of common Souldiers.</P>
<P>After this &s;laughter the Turkes attempted no more the expugnation of our Campe, except that once they did inuade the quarter of the Co&s;&s;acks, but with the like &s;ucce&s;&s;e, yet many times they brought out their Armies to open view, and as ma|ny times God of his mercy made way to our pre|uailings, and wee returned Victors: The &s;ame day the Bridge was fini&s;hed, which they had a while a|goe begun ouer the Riuer, that diuided their Campes: but to what purpo&s;e is not knowne, ex|cept to accommodate their pa&s;&s;ages the better: now al&s;o returned the Lord <HI>Siclentius,</HI> who had bin &s;ent into the Palatinate of Moldauia with an&s;wer to a Letter, which they &s;ent before, but what other newes he brought, is not apparant: It was al&s;o di&s;|couered, that a rumour was &s;pred into the Turkes campe, that the Sacred Maie&s;ty of <HI>Sigi&s;mond</HI> the King our Ma&s;ter, was come into the Field with a Royall &s;upply, and generall expedition, which a lit|tle affrighted the Tartars, who were now to fight a|gain&s;t fortifications and Armed men, contrary to their barbarous cu&s;tome of deuouring one another naked.</P>
<P>The 17. of September, our great Lord Generall
<PB N="12" REF="8"> held a martiall Coun&s;ell with the Lord Senators, Dukes, Gouernors, and Captaines, to which were al&s;o called the Lord <HI>Sahaidace,</HI> Generall of the Co&s;|&s;ackes with all his Colonels, and Officers, who with one voyce, and vnanimity of Spirit concluded and agreed, rather to die manfully in the field, then to goe backe one foot of ground, to giue the Enemy cau&s;e of pre&s;umption: and this was done with &s;uch generall alacrity, that although both the Armies, I meane, the Polonians and Co&s;&s;acks, were in great di&s;tre&s;&s;e and wants; yet they concluded, that by Gods grace, they would not be terrefied with any Enemy.</P>
<P>The 18. of September, certaine troopes of hor&s;e, and Companies of foot, made a &s;alley out of the Co&s;&s;acks quarter in the night vpon the Turkes Ar|my, which was done &s;o &s;ecretly and &s;uddenly, that they ouer-turned many Tents, ran&s;acked diuers Ca|bins, and killed &s;ome hundreds of men with Iaue|lings, Pollaxes, and Launces, without the report of a Peece, or carrying any Artillery with them: yea, herein they were &s;o fortunate, that they returned with great &s;poile, without the lo&s;&s;e of a man. The next night they performed as much, and with the like &s;tratagem &s;et vpon the Bridge they had newly builded &amp; erected, and &s;lew <HI>Corkan Ba&s;&s;aw,</HI> to who&s;e cu&s;tody and charge it was committed. They al&s;o killed many Turks, tooke nine pri&s;oners, and retur|ned with great &s;poiles and a rich prey, wherein were diuers garments furred with co&s;tly Furres, which I thinke, the Turkes v&s;e among the Tartars, who vpon
<PB N="13" REF="8"> many excur&s;ions, made into Ru&s;&s;ia by thou&s;and<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the&s;e dayes, returned with a wonderfull &s;poile, &s;elling them at a price to the Turks: and this was done euen as they came along to take vp their lodgings in the&s;e Prouinces.</P>
<P>At this time his Excellency, the Lord Gene|rall, was &s;ubiect to a great &s;ickne&s;&s;e, which &s;o im|paired his health, that he feared his life: where|vpon he &s;ummoned all Officers, and referred his gouernment to the Lord <HI>Campe,</HI> Ma&s;ter Generall, with all Millitary priuiledges, and imperiall fun|ctions, inue&s;ting vpon him as farre as he could his dignity and authority; yet were the whole Army de&s;irous to &s;ee the heroick Prince him&s;elfe moun|ted on hor&s;e-backe, as their Commaunder Ge|nerall, though as yet very young, &s;o that by this ioy and good mindes of the Army, he was much comforted, and incited to thanke them all, and be the more gracious vnto them, when time &s;hould &s;erue.</P>
<P>The 24. of September, hauing layne quiet a great while, an accident at home di&s;quieted vs all: For our great Lord Generall, labouring long in his &s;ickne&s;&s;e, and being wearied and &s;pent a|gaine with intollerable convul&s;ions, and di&s;tem|perature of the ayre, yeelded to the commaund of a higher Generall, and &s;o died in the Camp.</P>
<P>The 25. of September, the Emperour of Turks made a great preperation to &s;et vpon vs on all &s;ides, drawing out from their &s;euerall Quarters,

<P>The 11. of October, the Emperour of Turks &s;ent vnto his Maie&s;ty a Me&s;&s;enger with the&s;e in&s;tructi|ons, that we &s;hould fir&s;t rai&s;e our Camp, and depart out of Walachia, a Prouince &s;ubiect and tributary to him, which by no meane<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> we would agree vnto, proiecting altogether the dignity of the Kingdome, and the commodiou&s;ne&s;&s;e of the Army, both which might haue beene impaired, nay all quite ouer|throwne, if while we were pu&s;led thus in ri&s;ing; ei|ther the Turks breaking their couenants, might fall vpon vs; or ouer-taking vs in the Plaines, might pre&s;&s;e vpon vs with the greater number, and vn|prouided. Whereupon the Turke leauing the
<PB N="31" REF="17"> &s;tanding Bridge, which he made ouer the Riuer, re|moued his Camp &s;ome halfe mile backwarder, gi|uing vs leaue to make v&s;e of the Bridge, either for carriages too and fro, or our orderly marches: but yet we &s;tirred not for all this: no, though the Turke &s;tayed two dayes in that place; in&s;omuch, that wee had recour&s;e one to another, and tooke a liberty to flatter one another with formall welcomes, fea&s;ting, and kinde embraces, as is the cu&s;tome of reconciled friends, or if you will protected Enemies.</P>
<P>The 12. of October, the Grand Signieur marched fiue mile further, to the Riuer &s;urnamed Prath, and there &s;ettled his whole Army: The &s;ame day we di&s;|po&s;ed of our Ordnance in Carts made of purpo&s;e, and tooke the benefit of the Turkes Bridge, for the ea&s;ier accommodating our &s;elues, as you haue heard: yet was our King on foot, and had marched &s;ome few dayes before toward Leopolis, giuing vs dire|ctions not to &s;tirre, till the time appointed: For the Tartars were not yet appea&s;ed, but continued their accu&s;tomed manner of thefts and robberies, both in burning of Villages, and meeting with as naked men as them&s;elues; &s;o that when we departed indeed, we went very &s;trong, &s;ending our Munition and Caria|ges, two dayes before we threw downe our Tren|ches; where-about, al&s;o there was &s;ome di&s;puting, whether we &s;hould leuell them with the ground or no: for they &s;eemed a good refuge, if occa&s;ion &s;er|ued to retire vnto.</P>
<P>The 13. of October, the Turkes remoued againe a little beyond the Riuer of Prath, and encamped
<PB N="32" REF="18"> them&s;elues three mile further. The &s;ame day our il|lu&s;trious Prince continuing &s;till with the maine Ar|my, aro&s;e at once, and marched to the further &s;ide of I&s;ter ouer the Turkes Bridge, by a Towne called Zaranie, in the Prouince of Checinen, and in the field that belonged to the Ca&s;tle, where the Prince tooke vp his lodging, leauing the Lord <HI>Lermunth,</HI> and all the Germane Coherts to attend the Caria|ges and Carts, and &s;afe conduct the Artillery to the places appointed: For there were many &s;traglers of the Tartars, and Out-lopers of the Seruians and Walachians, that lay in waite for robberies, and &s;poiles, neither &s;paring vs, nor the Turkes them|&s;elues, if they could ouer-ma&s;ter either, and &s;o were no better then profe&s;&s;ed Theeues: and therefore was this order taken in our marches, not to be cir|cumuented, or made a &s;poile of in the breaking vp of a Campe.</P>
<P>All the next day, being the 14. of October, we ta|ried at Zaranie, till the Cariages came together, which the day following, being the 15. we &s;ent very early to Camenicen, whether wee al&s;o approched with the maine Troopes by Sunne &s;et. But the Co&s;&s;acks tooke another way, hauing many promi|&s;es of gratification, both from the Turke and our &s;elues, &s;uch was their valour, de&s;eruing commemo|ration: &s;uch were their enterpri&s;es compelling ac|knowledgement. That night the Prince lodged in the Ca&s;tle: and the next day the Commi&s;&s;ioners returned with the Articles of agreement, and ma|ny Honourable per&s;ons pre&s;ented them&s;elues, who
<PB N="33" REF="18"> were &s;euerally welcommed as Actors on the former &s;tage of Warre, and turmoile, and louers of their Countrey, for who&s;e &s;akes, as you haue heard, they aduentured both e&s;tates and per&s;ons, and were rea|dy to powre out their bloods, as they named it, for the cro&s;&s;e of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>After the &s;erious matters were debated, the Am|ba&s;&s;adours di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and the affaires &s;ettled, they had &s;ome time to talk of other bu&s;ines, and among&s;t the re&s;t of the Turkes di&s;po&s;ition, concerning whom one of the Bas&s;hawes had di&s;couered to the Polonians, while they were about their tractate of peace: how irke&s;ome and di&s;ta&s;ting it was to the young Emperour, who many times in a franticke manner would excruciate and torment him&s;elfe with actions of di&s;temperature, as throwing of his Turbane, beating his brea&s;t, and kicking his very Bas&s;hawes, who dur&s;t not reply, but were &s;ubiect to a very &s;laui&s;h pro&s;titution, and then would he fall to weeping, and wringing his hands to thinke vpon his inau&s;pitious actions, and vnfortunate attempts, remembring two e&s;peciall times: one when with &s;eauen thou&s;and of our Army, we &s;et vpon 10000. Turkes, who made a braue &s;alley on our Trenches, but were beaten backe with violence to their owne homes, at which he &s;o &s;tormed, that he called them Slaues, Vagabonds, and idle; as if they had played the Traytors of purpo&s;e to ecclip&s;e his glory, and obumbrate his renowne.</P>
<P>Another: when the Co&s;&s;acks &s;allyed vpon them, and &s;lew &s;o many of the Tartars, that they were
<PB N="34" REF="19"> weary of killing, and &s;o returned with a great prey and &s;poile into their owne quarters. But of all that fatall day, the 18. of September troubled and tor|mented him, when he re&s;olued and &s;et vp his re&s;t to ouer-runne vs at once, and came forward with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that we feared our &s;elues, had not God fought for vs, and turned them backe with a great &s;laughter: yea, &s;uch was our lo&s;&s;e, and the doubt|fulne&s;&s;e of the victory, that all Europe rang with our ouerthrow: and in Hungary it was reported, how he was come as farre as Sendomiria and Cra|couia; but (God be thanked) it fell out otherwi&s;e, and as now the tale is told, a &s;trange accident affirgh|ted them all, which we knew not then, nor doe we now pre&s;ume vpon, either as our de&s;eruing, or cau&s;e of pre&s;eruation.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day, an Earthquake chaunced in the Turkes Camp, in &s;uch a fearefull and palpable man|ner, that the whole Army ranne out of their Tents, leauing the Emperour with &s;ome certaine Cham|berers and Ianizaries alone in his: who on a &s;ud|daine demaunded; what was become of his Army? to whom it was an&s;wered, That part were gone vp|on a Cami&s;ado on the Polonians, and part were ranne out as amazed at the Earthquake. And part, now the cur&s;e of <HI>Mahomet</HI> part them, &s;aid he: What doe I here to be a &s;corne to you all, and a deri&s;ion to po&s;terity? With that he &s;natched at a Semiter, and whether he meant to &s;trike at them, or di&s;patch him|&s;elfe, they could not tell. But thus preuented, hee fell groueling on the ground, and vp againe with a

<P>Oh God! that ha&s;t giuen vs bread, and enlarged our Empire with the territories of Iewes, Chri&s;ti|ans, and Kingdomes be&s;ide? that ha&s;t made the hou&s;e of <HI>Othoman</HI> a &s;courge and terrour to all Na|tions, and enlarged our renowne before any Prince vnder the Sunne: that ha&s;t giuen vs a Prophet, and a Law, whereby our Alcharon is without oppo&s;i|tion: that ha&s;t made our <HI>&s;acra porta</HI> a wonder in na|ture, and aduanced our great Citty on a hill of emi|nency, that the Nations may call <HI>Stanbole</HI> beau|tifull, and come from a farre to behold our <HI>Seralio.</HI> But what &s;hall become of all this?

Shall all the&s;e Kingdoms re|&s;ume a new courage of reuolting, as if the Mahume|tane Empire were now at the highe&s;t, and my di&s;a|&s;trous childi&s;hne&s;&s;e the di&s;couerer of the &s;ecret?

And now, and now: am I borne to &s;hame and confu&s;ion? Oh God! Oh <HI>Mahomet,</HI> &s;hall it be thus?</P>
<P>To this, or the like purpo&s;e was that day &s;pent by the young Prince, till at la&s;t, as you &s;ee the vpper &s;treames of a Riuer follow one another, mi&s;chiefe att<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">nded mi&s;chiefe, and the cries of wounded men a&s;&s;ured him, there was newes of another &s;laughter to torment him; then grew he &s;o mad indeed, that no body dur&s;t come in his &s;ight, had not the Mu&s;ty and &s;ome Doctors of the Law leuiated this phrenzie with hone&s;t di&s;cour&s;e; and from example, made a Catapla&s;me as it were for his &s;ore: telling him the &s;tory of <HI>Baiazet,</HI> whom <HI>Tamberlaine</HI> bound in chains, and of <HI>Soliman</HI> the magnificent, who after many glo|rious victories, &s;aw the malice of a woman to de|&s;troy his &s;onne <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> and the re&s;t of his family:

Againe, Fortune was not alwayes di&s;po&s;ed to be waaton, nor would at all times attend the chariot of Warre: therefore it was be&s;t yeelding a little to time, e&s;pecially now, when warlike Nati|ons had learned this di&s;cipline, to enclo&s;e an Army within Trenches, and Palli&s;adoes, that dur&s;t not en|dure the fury of a battail<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">, nor the violence of &s;uch forces, as were &s;ure to make their way in the open fields. Be&s;ides, experience had di&s;couered this &s;ecret, that a well fortified Towne was now longer a win|ning and battering, then a whole Prouince in times pa&s;t in ouer-running and conquering.</P>
<P>In this manner, they pacified the young Prince, and prepared him again&s;t all manner of ominous ac|cidents: &s;o that when the Treaty of Peace came in deed, the Commi&s;&s;ioners proceeded, as you haue heard, and not onely e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">fected that, which they went for: but returned with &s;ufficient reward, and equall acceptation, relating the matter as it chanced, and certifying our Prince with the whole di&s;cour&s;e,
<PB N="38" REF="21"> while he was re&s;ident at Camenices.</P>
<P>Thus far gentle Reader, hath one Letter brought me, and the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, which being in a high Latine phra&s;e, and a Poli&s;h Character doth warrant, it came from &s;ome Gentleman of quality, or Souldier of ac|count, or both in one man, who was &s;ure an actor in the &s;ame: and heerein I haue not failed in any &s;ub|&s;tance of matter, except in &s;ome circum&s;tance of time, or Ortography of proper names, mi&s;taking a Z for an L, or an s for an r, with &s;uch like, &amp;c. which &s;uch, as know the Countrey, may ea&s;ely mend; and &s;uch as know not, may yet vnder&s;tand the truth of the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, without taking exceptions at the ac|cent of proper places, onely I mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e I finde not the word <HI>Rex</HI> in all the Letter, but at the latter end: onely <HI>illu&s;ri&s;simus Princeps</HI> is often named, which whether it meane the Father or Sonne, I leaue it to him that can iudge by the coherence of the &s;en|tences, and application of the diui&s;ions: what is done, is meerely for thy &s;atisfaction; and what is to be done, will afford you the like plea&s;ure: For in both, you may &s;ee the mercy of a great God, and the vanity of a pre&s;umptuous man: the one can pull downe the proud, and aduance the humble and weake: the other mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e the changes of mor|tality, &amp; alteration of humane condition: or knock his knees together with feare and trembling, when with <HI>Bel&s;ha&s;her</HI> he &s;ees the hand writing on the wall. Thus did the A&s;&s;irian Monarch banquet in the bounds of the Sanctuary, and that in &s;ecurity, when yet the &s;ame night the Medes and Per&s;ians be&s;ieged
<PB N="39" REF="21"> Babylon, and hee was betrayed into his Enemies hands with the lo&s;&s;e of his life, and Kingdome. And thus did the great Turke threaten Poland, as hoping thereby to make a way into Europe, and the Nor|therne Seas, when yet within three moneths he was vtterly di&s;appointed, and compelled to entertaine a Peace, when in a youthfull iollity his heart &s;corned to entertaine any thing but reuenge or ambitious de&s;ignes. Now the God of all ble&s;&s;ings make vs thankfull for &s;o great a mercy, that his benefits be not be&s;towed in vaine, nor wee the &s;onnes of men more &s;tupid and ingratefull, then the bruit bea&s;ts, that acknowledge his kindne&s;&s;e, and euerla&s;ting goodne&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>I haue al&s;o (gentle Reader) another Letter for thee, which depends immediatly vpon the former, &s;orting in euery thing to the truth: but that I finde a little di&s;crepancy in the ri&s;ing of the Camp, which either may be mi&s;taken by the difference of <HI>&s;tilo no|uo,</HI> and <HI>antiquo,</HI> or by the Kings going to Leopolis, before the maine Camps brake vp, and the Tartars were ab&s;olutely appeaz'd, or drawne away by the Grand Signieur. I finde it tran&s;lated to my hand, and written from Leopolis to &s;ome man of Honour el&s;e where: but it hath neither date, nor &s;uper&s;crip|tion: no, nor the Author hath &s;ub&s;cribed his name; at which I doe not wonder, becau&s;e it is but a Copy, nor would haue thee wonder: For it is a common thing in Letters of newes and occurrences, wherein all men would be glad to participate their &s;ecrets for the common good, but not publi&s;h the Authors for

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gracious and Honourable Lord:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE fourth of October, wee departed from Lublinn, from whence I &s;ignified the pre&s;ent Occurrents, and hauing now expo&s;ed our &s;elues to a new iourney, we likewi&s;e a-new di&s;po&s;ed the order of our marches: For although the peace was concluded, yet the tydings of the Tartars and Valachians approches encrea&s;ed, who being not withdrawne out of the field, would not withdraw them&s;elues from their bea&s;tly manner of &s;poiles, robberies, rapes, and cruelty: Wherefore to pre|uent their reuenges, and &s;ecure our &s;elues, the Troopes were thus mar&s;halled. Fir&s;t, certaine Cor|nets of Hor&s;e-men, and Scowt-Ma&s;ters were &s;ent out; then the Vantguard with a Battalion on foot: then the Kings Maie&s;tie with his hou&s;hold-&s;eruants, and the Banner impre&s;&s;ed the Armes royall; to wit, a white Eagle with a white cro&s;&s;e diuided, and vp|on the &s;ame <HI>tecum et pro te.</HI> This En&s;igne con&s;i&s;ting of fiue hundred, was gathered at the charges of vo|luntary
<PB N="41" REF="22"> Courtiers, and by them exqui&s;itely &s;et out and ordered. After the&s;e, immediately followed the Kings Maie&s;tie, with a Troope of three hun|dred Dutch Hor&s;e, being his Guard: then came &s;uch Carriages as belonged to the King, and then &s;uch as belonged to the Souldiers: And la&s;t of all followed the reare, which con&s;i&s;ted mo&s;t of Ma&s;ters of Pole. The &s;ixth day wee came to Zamo&s;chia, where there adhaered vnto vs about &s;ixe thou&s;and Dutch Hor&s;e-men, who&s;e Colonell was the Pala|tine of Marcinburg, and &s;ixe thou&s;and Foot vnder the conduct of Colonell <HI>Arnhem:</HI> &s;o that thus &s;trengthened, we marched with greater &s;afety, yet not altogether without perill, vntill wee came to Leopolis. For on the one &s;ide we &s;aw the Country on fire, a mo&s;t certaine Character of the Tartars im|pre&s;&s;ion, who burned all before them, and we had now attained vnto their a&s;hes: on the other &s;ide, wee might ea&s;ely &s;ee many &s;tragling Seruians, and Bulgarians, who as the Tartars delighted in no|thing, but vniu&s;tifiable Robberies, in which manner for all the Turkes proclamation they continued, till they were quite retired home.</P>
<P>The 8. of October, we lodged all night in a little Towne, which had been burnt by the Tartars cal|led <HI>Podlitez,</HI> and from thence determined the next day to go forward: but feare cea&s;ed vpon the Vaunt|gard, by rea&s;on the Scowts returned with newes, that our Wagons were &s;urprized, and the noy&s;e went, they were ran&s;ackt by the Tartars: but thankes be to God, it proued a fal&s;e Alarum: onely &s;ome 4000.
<PB N="42" REF="23"> Tartars, and other of tho&s;e Nations appeared with a warlike countenance, and might haue been &s;u&s;pec|ted to take aduantage of our &s;traglers: but &s;eeing vs &s;o &s;trong, and &s;o well ordered, they gaue vs leaue to goe forward, and we left them to their &s;auage and vnnaturall immanity.</P>
<P>The day following, a Councell was called in a little Towne called Kimerton, and for as much as the maine body of the Tartars Army, was but three mile di&s;tant from vs, and that hauing done &s;o well all this while, wee would be loath to make a &s;huffling end at the parting: we there encamped our &s;elues, and aboad a whole day, and then taking the neigh|bouring people into our cu&s;tody, we marched for|ward toward Leopolis, and hauing the twelfth of October gayned the &s;ight of the City, euery man was cheared, and &s;olemnly prai&s;ed God for their former deliuerance. There came forth many of the Gentility to &s;alute and receiue the King: and after them followed multitudes of people: an old cu|&s;tome to applaud the action of Conquerors, or wel|come &s;uch Princes, who el&s;e would be their owne caruers. It was verily woorth the &s;eeing: For the King neuer rode with &s;uch pompe and confluence into any City; and becau&s;e it was remarkable, and worthy of memory, I will hereafter compile it into a larger di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;end it your Honour. In the meane time, to &s;atisfie tho&s;e that de&s;ire to know the pre&s;ent e&s;tate of our affaires, I will briefly make a &s;ummary collection, and intimate our deliuerances, as they chanced.</P>

<P>Beyond all expectation a &s;aluation is befalne vs: For wee are relea&s;ed from the extreame&s;t perill whereinto wee were falne, not by our owne dili|gence and power, but by the &s;peciall prouidence of God, who hath done great wonders for vs. Behold our matters were at the point of lo&s;&s;e, our Souldi|ers being wearied and tyred with Turki&s;h a&s;&s;aults: our powder and Munition failed our people, ta&s;ted of hunger and and wants. <HI>Kotkouite</HI> Palatine of the Wilde, and Generall of the Army died in the Campe: our Prince fell &s;icke and &s;added our hearts, and many other inconueniences be&s;ides the &s;laugh|ters of our men, threatned our ruine, and vtter &s;ub|uer&s;ion. But behold on a &s;uddaine how comfort ap|peared: about the 2. of October a treaty of Peace was offered, and accepted by the Turke, for which purpo&s;e wee were contented to depute certaine Commi&s;&s;ioners, who were accordingly entertained and admitted into the Turkes Campe, to wit the Ca&s;tellan of <HI>Bel&s;ens,</HI> and the Palatine of <HI>Lublines,</HI> who went roundly to worke, but after the Turki&s;h manner they &s;tood vpon high tearmes of o&s;tentati|on, vntill &s;ome, who &s;tood in Tractalion with them, mittigated the heauy impo&s;ed conditions, which continued vntill the 8. of October. In fine, the next day I know not by what &s;peciall working of God, the Turke ca&s;ting a &s;ide all the propounded Condi|tions, and interiected cauils, accepted the <HI>Pacta an|tiqua,</HI> which al&s;o was on both &s;ides confirmed and ratefied: Then were our Commi&s;&s;ioners admitted to the Emperours pre&s;ence, and kindely receiued
<PB N="44" REF="24"> and honoured with guiftes.</P>
<P>He al&s;o &s;ent vnto the Illu&s;trious Prince <HI>Vladi&s;laus,</HI> a liuing Elephant with many other thinges, who a|gaine regratulated him with Dogs, and certaine payres of hand Guns, made in the Low-Countries, and &s;o the Peace was publi&s;hed, and the Articles brought to the King to <HI>Leopolis,</HI> the Campe remai|ning yet firme, and the Co&s;&s;ackes continuing in their quarters.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the Turke retired his Army, and diuerted the Tartars, who all this while &s;poyled and burned the Countrey, hee al&s;o promi&s;ed great guifts to the Co&s;&s;ackes, which &s;hould heereafter be &s;ent by Le|gations, and what&s;oeuer was equally demaunded, was on the Turkes part mo&s;t Princely graunted; all which points con&s;idered, maketh this matter al|mo&s;t incredible: For the like is not found in the Turki&s;h Hi&s;tories, and in e&s;peciall, that the Empe|rour in per&s;on being in an expedition of &s;uch pre|paration, &s;hould condi&s;cend to &s;uch Articles of Peace, and be contented to returne home fru&s;trated and di&s;appoined.</P>
<P>But the&s;e bee Gods &s;ecrets to pre&s;erue vs, to the end that Chri&s;tendome &s;hould not by our ouer|throw, bee further infe&s;ted with Turki&s;h Armies. For que&s;tionles if wee had fayled either in our Campe, or incounters, hee had pa&s;&s;ed without con|trole, and the plaint Countrey would quickly haue beene ouer-runne by their multitudes, and outragi|ous Tartars who thought vpon nothing but ruine and de&s;truction: what &s;hould I in&s;i&s;t more vpon
<PB N="45" REF="24"> this matter? great Peace hath imbraced vs, and comfort lighted vpon our heades vnlookt for: Our Campe &s;hall be broken vp, and we dayly expect the Turkes Legate, for whom me Illu&s;trious Prince <HI>Vla|di&s;laus</HI> tarries, we as &s;uppo&s;e to conduct him to the King, who will abide 8. dayes at <HI>Leopolis</HI> to giue or|der for the di&s;charge of the Souldiers, and &s;etling of other matters behoofefull, partly for the&s;e Pro|uinces, partly for the good of Moldauia, and Podo|lia, with tho&s;e of Bogdonia, who are all included in the Articles.</P>
<P>After the di&s;patch of the&s;e affaires, the King in|tendeth to returne to War&s;aw, as receiuing Letters out of Sweden, which are not altogether plea&s;ing vnto him: In the meane while the Gentlemen and Ma&s;ters are di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, and many Souldiers, who are yet in the expedition haue order to returne, and a generall Commaundement is gone out to haue Prayers and Proce&s;&s;ions in euery Church, yea I am &s;ure by to that time the newes came Cracow, and o|ther Citties, they will not &s;pare for Bonfiers, and make a generall reioycing in euery place.</P>
<P>I know that the&s;e thinges will bee acceptable ti|dings to your Honour, the euent of other cau&s;es I will hereafter, &s;ignifie. Send the Conditions of the Peace, or if you will the Articles of agreement, and diligently write what el&s;e &s;hall bee worth the relating, as I encounter with &s;uch, as come out of the Campe: All I de&s;ire now is, that this my dili|gence may bee commended, and dedicated vnto
<PB N="26" REF="25" MS="y"> your gracious fauour: I am promi&s;ed a di&s;cour&s;e of the departure of the Tartars, and how they tooke their leaues of the <HI>Gran Seigneurs,</HI> when it comes it &s;hall &s;alute you with &s;peed, in the meane while Gracious Lord, if I re&s;t in your Fauour, I haue my de&s;ire.</P>

<P>Thus (gentle Reader) thou ha&s;t likewi&s;e the la&s;t Letter with the conditions of peace, as they were then ratified by the Turks, and King of Poles Com|mi&s;&s;ioners: there were al&s;o read in publique the old
<PB N="49" REF="26"> contracts, containing the limitation of their King|domes, and the mentioning their friends and con|federates, with all tributary Prouinces, and many other things impertinent at the&s;e times: all which I haue omitted to trouble you withall, re&s;oluing only to &s;atisfie you with a plaine truth of the end of the Warre, and to tell you a wonder in the making the truce: the v&s;e is meerely to &s;et out the glory of God, who can turne the frame of heauen about, and bring that to pa&s;&s;e with ea&s;ine&s;&s;e, which the wi&s;edome of man thinketh impo&s;&s;ible, and the pollicy of King|domes determineth to contriue another way: and to di&s;credite the o&s;tentation of Princes, who out of their owne pre&s;umption can boa&s;t of great matters: but when the cau&s;e comes to bee decided in the Court of Heauen, they are laughed to &s;corne, and a contrary &s;entence condemneth them, as delinquents to the Maie&s;tie of God, and offenders again&s;t their owne &s;oules and con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>Since this, I haue al&s;o receiued other Letters a|mong&s;t the Marchants from Con&s;tantinople, dated the 10. of December, which make mention of the Grand Signieurs being at Andrinopolis, but is not yet come to the great Citie: onely the Haga of Ia|nizaries, and certaine Officers of the Seralio are ar|riued to prepare the Pallace, and clen&s;e the Towne, that both Court and Citie may be fit for his enter|tainment. And among&s;t the re&s;t, there is one thing mo&s;t remarkable, that his Vnkle <HI>Mu&s;tapha,</HI> when he was depo&s;ed, did Prophe&s;ie of this peace: and in a manner foretolde, that the <HI>Ottaman</HI> Empire was at
<PB N="30" REF="27" MS="y"> the highe&s;t, and &s;hould no further enlarge the &s;unne, but rather decline, and &s;ee their renowne &s;hadowed with malignity of time: But becau&s;e his Spirit was not an&s;werable to his greatnes, the Ianizaries neg|lected him: nor his wi&s;dome for lacke of publicke conuer&s;ation, as being alwayes kept Pri&s;oner, &s;ati&s;|factory to the gouernment, hee was the &s;ooner put downe, and &s;o as yet he remaines vn&s;trangled, and peraduenture vnre&s;pected.</P>
<P>There now remaines no more, but for the Poles to fortefie their confines, &amp; &s;tand vpon their Guard for all this Contract of amity, and treatice of purification, con&s;idering the fry of Nations, that lye Ea&s;tward from them, who either are enemies to Chri&s;tian Religion as Idolaters, and Mahumetans: or indeed of no Religion, as running the violent race of Sauagenes and bea&s;tiallity, all which good care and vigilancy will preuent, con&s;idering as I haue often &s;aid, they are naked men, haue no Di&s;ci|pline, and are to &s;eeke when they come to Trenches and Fortifications: Yet for all this good &s;ucce&s;&s;e: and pro&s;perous euent of the Warre? I would nei|ther haue them too pre&s;umptuous, or elated, as though their owne Arme of fle&s;h had done it: nor tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rous or exanimated though they heare of the Turkes preparation again&s;t them. For it is not the &s;ound of 2. or 300000. of men can conquer Coun|tries and Kingdomes, but the extraordinary valour of well di&s;ciplined Souldiers, nor are they likewi&s;e to boa&s;t with the <HI>Syreans</HI> that they can licke vp the du&s;t of <HI>Samaria,</HI> and transferre the Diadems of Prin|ces
<PB N="31" REF="27" MS="y"> at their plea&s;ure, but to know there is a God of Battailes, that made <HI>Gideons</HI> 300. ouerrunne the <HI>Mi|dianites,</HI> and will doe wonders for his Church in de|&s;pight of the watchings of the Dragon: yea I make no doubt but that the &s;ame God, which hath deli|uered Chri&s;tendome from the Turkes excur&s;ions as you haue heard, will al&s;o deliuer the Prote&s;tant Princes from the Popes Cur&s;es, and Antichri&s;tian threatnings, as you &s;hall &s;hortly &s;ee, And &s;o I end with the Poet:
