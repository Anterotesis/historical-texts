<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my former, I gave you an Account of the late King's coming before <HI>London Derry,</HI> and what afterwards happen'd, till the 23d. of <HI>April,</HI> when <HI>Kilmore</HI> was &s;urrendred, at which time Colonel <HI>Lundce</HI> their then Governour, that very Morn|ing made his E&s;cape. It now remains, that I give a Re|lation of what has fallen out &s;ince, and of the Condition of the Place.</P>
<P>The Be&s;ieged having rejected all Offers made them by the late King, and provok'd the Be&s;iegers in divers Sal|lies; as al&s;o being uncertain when Relief would arrive from <HI>England,</HI> re&s;olv'd to put them&s;elves into the be&s;t Po&s;ture they could; and to that purpo&s;e unanimou&s;ly declar'd their Re&s;olutions to Live and Die with their new Governour, Mr. <HI>George Walker,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Henry Baker,</HI> and to &s;ubmit with an entire Obedience to their Conduct and Commands for defence of the City.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place they examin'd the Publick Trea&s;ury, where they expected to have found the Five hundred Pounds &s;ent them from <HI>London</HI> by Captain <HI>Beverly,</HI> in the fir&s;t Ship that brought them Arms and Ammunition, and a far greater Sum, but the Birds were flown. Then they took a View of the Ammunition and Stores, and found near 500 Barrels of Powder untouch'd, Ball and March &s;ufficient, as al&s;o Bullets for their great Guns, of which they have 24 mounted upon the Ba&s;tions of the Walls, upon the Tower of the Church two, and eight within the City; that is to &s;ay, one at each Gate, and one at each Corner of the Market-Hou&s;e in the middle of the City, and fronting each Gate.</P>
<P>In the third place, They made In&s;pection into the Stores of Provi&s;ions, and found a va&s;t quantity of wheat, Meal, Oat-meal, Beef, Bacon, Salt, Salmon, and Butter, Chee&s;e, Malt, Beer, Brandy, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which was all Inven|tory'd, and put into publick Store-Hou&s;es, with Guards &s;et over them. Al&s;o all Merchants, and Trade&s;men, to prevent imbezling their Wares, and Merchandizes, took Inventories of their &s;everal Goods, and carry'd them into publick Store-Hou&s;es, which are guarded day and night.</P>
<P>Moreover, upon a Mu&s;ter of all that bore Arms, they were found to be about 12000, which are all form'd into Regiments and Companies, every Regiment under a Col. Lieutenant Col. Major, and Captain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> amounting to 17 in all. The Colonels are,

</LIST></P>
<P>Eight more who&s;e Names I do not at pre&s;ent re|member.</P>
<P><HI>Tho. John&s;on</HI> is al&s;o made Mayor of the Town.</P>
<P>All the Women and Children that brought no Sub|&s;i&s;tance along with them into the City, nor could give any account of them&s;elves; as al&s;o many that are unfit to bear Arms, were put our of the Town ju&s;t before the Siege began, which was one rea&s;on that they have &s;o ma|ny now in Arms, in regard that many who brought no Sub&s;i&s;tance into the Town, rather than be turn'd out of the Gates, gladly took up Arms to earn their Su&s;te|nance. But of two thou&s;and Hor&s;e, which after the Pro|te&s;tants were broken at <HI>Clawde-Ford,</HI> march'd into <HI>Lon|don Derry;</HI> there are not now a hundred left for want of <HI>Forrage,</HI> which con&s;train'd them to turn the Hor&s;es out of the Gates, the greate&s;t part of which fell into the Enemies hands, only &s;ome few are &s;till left that graze under the protection of the City Canon, which the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> however now and then pick up, as often as they dare ad|venture, and for which as often they pay very dearly, being either &s;hot dead, wounded, or taken Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The great Gates of the City are barricado'd within|&s;ide with huge pieces of Timber; the Keys are kept at the Main-Guard, and eight Captains, two to a Gate are upon the Watch every Night. When there is occa|&s;ion, the Keys are not to be deliver'd, as was u&s;ual to a Serjeant, but into the hands of the Captains that guard the particular Po&s;t.</P>
<P>Two Regiments are upon Duty every Night, and up|on the lea&s;t Alarum they are all to repair to the Walls, without expecting any other Orders.</P>
<P>There are in the Town five Mini&s;ters who have the Commands of &s;o many Companies, and have every one of them given &s;ignal Proofs of their Valour; particu|larly one Mr. <HI>Chri&s;topher Jenney.</HI></P>
<P>The private Souldiers are all in good Heart; the Al|lowance to each Man for a Week, being a Salmon and a half, two pound of Beef, and four quarts of Oat-meal. Good &s;trong Beer is al&s;o order'd to be &s;old at a Penny a Quart, though not to the Souldiers after Eight at night, to avoid Di&s;orders.</P>
<P>Blinds are al&s;o &s;et up by the Command of the Gover|nours to &s;ecure the Men upon the Walls from the Ene|mies Battery.</P>
<P>There is in <HI>Derry</HI> one <HI>C. Darus</HI> of <HI>Plattin,</HI> in the Cour|ty of <HI>Meath,</HI> who is kept a Pri&s;oner, as having been ta|ken at <HI>Chappel</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and was one that Com|manded in the Recruits &s;ent by <HI>Tyrconnel</HI> to the late King into <HI>England.</HI> General <HI>Hamilton</HI> has wrote &s;e|veral Letters to the Governours to have this Captain &s;et at Liberty, but they do not think fit to part with him; neverthele&s;s they u&s;e him civilly.</P>
<P>The <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> al&s;o very much lament the lo&s;s of Major <HI>Ro|bert Nangle,</HI> (the Son of Tory <HI>Nangle,</HI> that was &s;hot at <HI>Longford-Bridge</HI>) who together with two Troopers was drown'd, while they endeavour'd to get over the Pa&s;s at <HI>Clawdeeford.</HI> 'Tis al&s;o believ'd that Col. <HI>Domi|nic Sheldon</HI> is dead of the Wounds he receiv'd in one of the Sallies made by the Be&s;ieged, from the hands of one Mr. <HI>Arthur Ivory,</HI> a brisk young Gentleman, who fought the Colonel hand to hand, till at length two of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI>
<PB REF="2">coming into the Colonel's Re&s;cue, &s;hot the Gentleman, dead.</P>
<P>The late King has made Col. <HI>Charles Moore</HI> Governour of <HI>Colraign,</HI> where he keepr with a Garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ting of 1000 Men. The Marque&s;s of <HI>Antrim</HI> is made Gover|nour of <HI>Charrick Fergus,</HI> which has the &s;ame number of Souldiers to defend it. And <HI>Gourdon Oncale</HI> is al&s;o made Governour of <HI>Charlemont,</HI> though not having with him above 200 Souldiers.</P>
<P><HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> The la&s;t Week arrived here a Ve&s;&s;el from <HI>Ire|land</HI> with Pa&s;&s;engers, who credibly report, that the late King have received Advice from the Camp before <HI>Der|ry,</HI> that they were not a number &s;trong enough to &s;torm the City, nor to with&s;tand the Enemy, &s;hould they have Succours from <HI>England:</HI> and be&s;ides that they wanted Ammunition and great Guns, gave Orders for a con&s;i|derable Recruit to march Northward, but that when they came within two days March of <HI>Derry,</HI> the Regi|ment Commanded by young Sir <HI>Maurice Austace</HI> in the County of <HI>Kildare,</HI> and &s;ome other Regiments fell into a great Mutiny, &s;wearing by their <HI>Shouls</HI> they would not go to the King's Slaughter-Hou&s;e to be kill'd, as the <HI>French</HI> Generals, Sir <HI>Patrick Dowdel,</HI> Major <HI>Taaf,</HI> and the re&s;t had been, and that they wolud rather turn to the Prote&s;tants, and &s;erve King <HI>William,</HI> than be Slaves to the <HI>French.</HI> Upon which hundreds of them ran away, and betook them&s;elves to the Bogs and Mountains.</P>
<P>On Saturday <HI>May</HI> the 18th arriv'd from <HI>Dublin</HI> at <HI>Dawpool,</HI> betwixt <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Liverpool,</HI> one <HI>Can,</HI> Ma|&s;ter of a Ve&s;&s;el belonging to tho&s;e parts, on Board of whom were wany Pa&s;&s;engers, who had all of them Pa&s;|&s;es, for which they paid at the Secretaries Office in <HI>Dub|lin,</HI> 3 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 10 <ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> for every individual Per&s;on, though mo&s;t we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">e Women and Children. They left <HI>Dublin</HI> the 15th, and bring Advice, That on the 14th an Order came from the late King, to grant no more Pa&s;&s;es. They al&s;o &s;ay further, That the Duke of <HI>Tyrconnel</HI> was at <HI>Chappel I|zard,</HI> but dangerou&s;ly ill of the black Jaundies, and of a &s;hot in his Shoulder, and wound in his Hand, that the Phy&s;itians had given him over as pa&s;t recovery. That Mr. <HI>Fitz: James</HI> is dead, and many of the Souldiers dye daily (they fear of the Plague) in the Camp, for that having no Salt, they are forced to hang what Fle&s;h they kill on the Trees to dry, which had bred many Di&s;tem|pers among&s;t them&punc; On Monday the 13th, another Re|enforcement March'd from <HI>Dublin</HI> towards the Camp before <HI>Derry,</HI> with two Cannon, a very large Morter-piece, and &s;ome large Bombs; the Morter-piece was drawn by 16 good Hor&s;es; but as they were drawing it up <HI>Cork-Hill,</HI> the Chains broke, and the Piece rowl'd back again to the bottom, which made one of the Offi|cers, Major <HI>Barker</HI> &s;ware a bloody Oath, he believed they were bewitched, and to cur&s;e a Prote&s;tant Gentle+man that &s;tood near, with the Appellation of Heretick Witch, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Some of the&s;e Pa&s;&s;engers &s;ay, That the late King has lately lo&s;t many Men before <HI>Derry,</HI> and that they &s;aw at <HI>Dublin</HI> four Velvet Coffins, wherein were the Bodies of four great Per&s;ons that were Slain before that Town, and which were privately Interred at Midnight.</P>
<P>Several <HI>Highlanders</HI> have attended the late King for Commi&s;&s;ions, which they have obtained, and have pro|mis'd him great things, as he has done to them, if For|tune favours them with Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>On Thur&s;day the 16th. Major General <HI>Kirk</HI> with three brave Regiments Embarqued at <HI>Liverpool</HI> for <HI>London-Derry,</HI> having on Board him many Engineers and Gun|ners, with great &s;tore of Ammunition, Arms, Morters, Bombs, and a great quantity of Wheat, Barrels of Beef, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>On Friday they &s;et Sail, but the Wind did not prove &s;o fair as was hoped; but they are &s;till at Sea, or el&s;e at <HI>Derry</HI> e're this, for that they re&s;olved to Sail down the River in &s;pight of all that could be done by the Fort of <HI>Kilmore,</HI> which they doubted not to beat about the Ears of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> if they dur&s;t &s;tay within it to make any re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>After the&s;e Per&s;ons had left <HI>Dublin,</HI> Advice was brought to the late King that 6000 Foot of the Garri&s;on of <HI>London-Derry,</HI> and about 100 Hor&s;e in two Troops, had made a Salley at Mid-night upon his Camp, Killed, wounded, and taken &s;ome thou&s;ands, and thereby had rai&s;ed the Siege, and made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters again of <HI>Kilmore,</HI> of which we expect the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">firmation every hour. The la&s;t Letters from <HI>Scotland</HI> of the 17th in&s;tant, do &s;ay, that there Advices from <HI>Ireland</HI> give account that <HI>Lon|don Derry</HI> and <HI>Inniskilling</HI> hold out bravely; that the latter within the&s;e few days had made a great and vigo|rous Sally, in which they killed a great number of the Enemies, and made a &s;afe Retreat into the City.</P>
<P>By a Ve&s;&s;el come into <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> on Monday the 20th. in&s;tant, in four days from the <HI>I&s;le of Man,</HI> the Ma&s;ter whereof &s;ays, he there left divers of the Prote&s;tants newly arrived from <HI>Ireland,</HI> who do affirm, that the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Army, having received a Reinforcement, made a General A&s;&s;ault upon <HI>London Derry</HI> la&s;t Sabbath|day was fortnight, with great fury; that the Be&s;ieged made a mo&s;t gallant Defence, and with that Succe&s;s, that they beat them above a Mile beyond their Camp, and kill'd &s;ome thou&s;ands, of which are many Per|&s;ons of Quality, particularly Major General <HI>Ram&s;ey,</HI> and Cap. <HI>Cu&s;&s;ack,</HI> (the Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> not yet heard of) they had in their Camp 13 Coaches, which they fill'd, and drew off with the dead Bodies of Per&s;ons of Quality and Officers. And &s;o ob&s;tinate and bloody was the Fight, and their Lo&s;s &s;o great, that they were forced to rai&s;e the Siege, and are retreated above 40 miles to a place called <HI>Lambeg Li&s;&s;negarney.</HI> They have &s;ince in the County of <HI>Down,</HI> and other places, mo&s;t barbarou&s;ly murthered many <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and give out, they daily expect Recruits, and will be Ma&s;ters of <HI>Lon|don-Derry,</HI> or hazard the whole Army. The Ship Ma&s;ter afore-mentioned likewi&s;e &s;ays, tho&s;e he &s;aw at the <HI>I&s;le of Man</HI> of the Prote&s;tants from <HI>Ireland,</HI> e&s;|caped with their Lives only, having u&s;ed them barba|rou&s;ly.</P>
<P>Another Per&s;on who came Wedne&s;day la&s;t from <HI>Dub|lin,</HI> confirms the Fight to have been very bloody, as there related; and that the Prote&s;tants have regained <HI>Kilmore.</HI> So that it's believed the three Regiments of Maj. Gen. <HI>Kirk,</HI> Sir <HI>W. Hanmore,</HI> and Col. <HI>Stewart,</HI> with the re&s;t of their Squadron, are all got &s;afe into <HI>London Derry</HI> without any Oppo&s;ition, and have had a joyful meeting with tho&s;e brave Souls who have &s;tood in the Gap to &s;ave a Nation.</P>
<P>A Ve&s;&s;el is al&s;o come into the We&s;t from the Town of <HI>Lymerick,</HI> the Ma&s;ters &s;ays, That the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> are ex|treamly unwilling to meet the Prote&s;tants in Battel, e&s;|pecially the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Army, of whom they are &s;o afraid, that in <HI>Lymerick</HI> it &s;elf there are but 4 or 5 Companies of raw, undi&s;ciplin'd Men, not half Armed, who take all Opportunities to run away they can. And it's thought one Man of War with 2 or 300 Men, might &s;oon be Ma&s;ters of the place. And that the like might be done at <HI>Galloway,</HI> and bring off that gallant Gentle|man, Sir <HI>Thomas Southwell,</HI> and about 140 more of his followers, now under Condemnation there, for no other Crime, than their own Defence, and being Prote&s;tants, which is now Crime enough to ballance all the Servi|ces and Loyalty Fle&s;h and Blood can be capable of; an eminent in&s;tance of which is not many days Old.</P>
<P>Col. <HI>Ru&s;&s;ell</HI> of <HI>Ireland,</HI> who was Governour of <HI>Gal|loway,</HI> and commanded the be&s;t Regiment of Hor&s;e in that Kingdom, &s;ince the late King's arrival in that King|dom, was turned out of his Government fir&s;t, and &s;oon after from his Command as Colonel; and in the height of his di&s;&s;atisfaction, humbly waited on the late King, and laid before him his con&s;tant Services to his Father, his Brother, and him&s;elf; and what an Affliction it was to him to have now his Loyalty que&s;tioned, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The late <HI>King</HI> told him, <HI>He mu&s;t needs confe&s;s and own all he had &s;aid was true &mdash; But it was al&s;o as true, that he was now under Circumstances that would not permit him to tru&s;t any Man of his Profe&s;&s;ion, viz.</HI> A Prote&s;tant of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
