As seems typical lately, tech did not use HIs in any of their 448 keyed HEADs. I did not add HI tags to the HEADs, and PARDONed this file.
I removed a modern descriptive addition on REF1v.
I added FIGDESCs to FIGUREs.
I spent much time DIV TYPEing.
Corrected [ 29 ] illegible groups out of [ 46 ].
Converted [ 17 ] illegible groups to GAP DESC="illegible".
