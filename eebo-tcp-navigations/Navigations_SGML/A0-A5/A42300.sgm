<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE kind reception you were plea&s;ed to afford a &s;mall Pa|per of mine, that had lately the ho|nour to have your Name prefixt,
<PB REF="5"> hath given this encouragement to pre&s;ent to your view, a further Col|lection of Experiments touching the &s;ame Subject, relating to the Waters of <HI>Bathe,</HI> a place you were plea&s;ed once to grace with your Practice, and &s;till with your Favours, for which a more than ordinary re&s;pect is, in gratitude, your due.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, Con&s;idering you have &s;o far favoured my late Enquiries, as to a&s;&s;i&s;t me by your pre&s;ence, and be an Eye-witne&s;s of &s;ome of the Experiments, and are a &s;uffici|ent Judge of them all, I could not fix on any fitter than your &s;elf, and the Learned Body you have Relation to, to make this Addre&s;s unto, or give the Trouble of this pre&s;ent Dedication.</P>
<PB REF="5">
<P>It hath caus'd me &s;ometimes not a little to admire, That the Me|tropolitan Waters of all <HI>England,</HI> (as I may term Them) to &s;ay no more, &s;hould lye 2000 years, and it may be much longer, in &s;o narrow a Dioce&s;s; for the di&s;|covery I have made of many Things relating to Them, (of which in part here is &s;ome Account) that were never taken notice of by for|mer Per&s;ons, and tho&s;e few Wri|ters that have Treated of Them, will Ju&s;tifie the Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Principles formerly were accounted Sulphur, Copper, Iron, and a little Marca&s;ite; of late, Bi|tumen, Nitre, and &s;ome Sulphur, which la&s;t I endeavour to Confirm, with the Addition of many more, which will partly Con&s;titute, and partly evidence the Nature of the&s;e
<PB REF="6"> Waters: Be&s;ides the beneficial di&s;|covery of the Rational u&s;e of the Bath-waters in Potion, which hi|therto having been but as a good Back-Sword, are now become a Single-Rapier, ready to &s;ave, and not de&s;troy, unle&s;s ill manag'd by a di&s;temper'd hand.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I did not think to have appeared in this Dre&s;s, having de|&s;igned, and in part compleated, as you know very well, &s;omething el&s;e, that would have better &s;uited with my Condition, the Dignity of the Subject, and Reputation of The&s;e Waters. But finding &s;ome ha&s;ty Chirurgion that hath already launced what I intended &s;hould have had a longer Time to dige&s;t, and expecting, as none but in rea|&s;on mu&s;t, the Pretences of many others, I found my &s;elf oblig'd to
<PB REF="6"> appear, though in a carele&s;s habit, and in a manner undre&s;t, rather than too much to exerci&s;e the Pa|tience, if not ju&s;tly incur the Cen|&s;ure of tho&s;e friends, who&s;e kind|ne&s;s &s;hall induce them to give me a Vi&s;it.</P>
<P>And although my Nature in|clines me rather to a diffidence, than pre&s;umption on any thing that is my own, yet I mu&s;t be &s;o far confident as to believe, that the Exi&s;tence of Nitre in the Waters of <HI>Bathe,</HI> &s;o much que&s;tion'd by &s;ome, and my particular Concern, is &s;o fully e&s;tabli&s;ht by the fol|lowing Experiments, made with my own hands, as to keep tho&s;e words upright in my late Letter to your &s;elf, wherein I a&s;&s;ert it to be un|deniable. And whoever &s;hall take the pains to &s;atisfie him&s;elf in that
<PB REF="7"> Particular, as I have done, and &s;hall let me know wherein he is di&s;&s;atisfied, and can convince me to the Contrary, whom I will a&s;|&s;ure he &s;hall not find ob&s;tinate, he &s;hall have the Honour, if that be any thing, of making me his Convert, (for I think my &s;in|gle Reputation a &s;mall Sacrifice on the Altar of Truth;) but if not, it will appear, which is no great matter on either hand, that &s;ome Body hath been mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>However the Satisfaction is not little, nor the Omen bad, that I have already gained the Appro|bation of a Per&s;on &s;o Judicious as your &s;elf, who have formerly taken pains on the &s;ame Account, and on which &s;ide &s;oever the Scales &s;hall turn, I have had this

<HEAD>A PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>_THat the Reader may be acquainted with the occa&s;ion, time, and manner of my making the&s;e Enquiries (which are not ha&s;ty conclu&s;ions, but the product of more mature con&s;ide|ration) I &s;hall here premi&s;e &s;omething concerning that, and al&s;o di&s;cour&s;e of, as more perti|nent in this place, &s;ome other matters tending to the enlargement of the Reputation, and u&s;efulne&s;s of the Waters.</P>
<P>Taking therefore into con&s;ideration the performances of &s;ome before me, and the attempts of others, in my time, which were not &s;atisfactory, and having the ad|vantages of a more retired nature, and con&s;tant re|&s;idence on the place, with tho&s;e Conveniencies which &s;ome others have not had, I thought it worth my while to employ my lei&s;ure hours in &s;ome Experiments on
<PB REF="9"> the Waters, which none had done before to any great purpo&s;e, the Waters having hitherto been rather ad|mir'd than under&s;tood, if &s;o I might give my own Curio&s;ity &s;atisfaction in that affair. And indeed, no vain glorious humour of de&s;iring to be Popular, which I never affected, nor itch to have my Name in print, which hath been already &s;ufficiently done by the kind|ne&s;s of my friends, and therefore needs not any labour of my own again, was the occa&s;ion of my entring on this undertaking; but ob&s;erving the Bath-water was drank by &s;ome, and probably like to advance, I could not &s;atisfie my &s;elf in advi&s;ing my Patients to it, un|le&s;s I had fir&s;t made a particular &s;earch into what it did contain, it &s;eeming as ab&s;urd to me to tell my friends tbat depended on my judgment for their health and pre&s;ervation, they &s;hould drink the Bath-water, which I knew nothing of, as to advi&s;e them to the u&s;e of &s;uch Spirits, Pills, or any other Medicine, I was ignorant of the compo&s;ition of, or had procured from others.</P>
<P>Had I found this done to my hand, I could well have di&s;pen&s;ed witb the confinement and ri&s;que this de&s;ign hath occa&s;ion'd, and &s;pent the&s;e hours I have done in my Study, as chearfully el&s;ewhere, but find|ing little &s;atisfaction in what had been before per|form'd, I fir&s;t made collection out of the be&s;t Mineral Authors, &s;uch as <HI>Fallopius, Agricola, Baccius,</HI> and others, what was the be&s;t way to obtain a Sediment out of any Water, and then how to know of what that &s;ediment did con&s;i&s;t, making application of this Theory to the Waters of this place.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving then the waies of gaining a Sediment to be chiefly &s;our, <HI>Evaporation, Di&s;tillation, Precipita|tion,</HI> and <HI>In&s;olation,</HI> the la&s;t, as too laborious, I thought fit to wave, and re&s;olved on the other three, Evapo|rating precipitating, and di&s;til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ing fir&s;t &s;mall quantities
<PB REF="9"> of all the Baths, which gave me encouragement to pro|ceed to greater.</P>
<P>Having obtained a Sediment, which I call the <HI>Contents</HI> of the Water, the very Notion of which was but lately a &s;tranger here, I tru&s;ted not to my &s;ingle judgment, but made it known to the be&s;t Phy&s;icians of my acquaintance, with whom I had Conver&s;e, particularly my ever honoured friend Sr. <HI>Edward Greaves,</HI> who&s;e encouragement to this de&s;ign hath not been little, and al&s;o addre&s;sed my &s;elf in writing to the very Ingenious and Eminent Doctor <HI>Willis</HI> (who&s;e lo&s;s all Ingenious Philo&s;ophers and Phy&s;icians mu&s;t la|ment, his many thoughts now dying with him) who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance I de&s;ired by Letter dated <HI>1.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe Acquaintance I had the happine&s;s to have with you formerly in <HI>Oxon,</HI> and the Civilities you have been plea&s;ed to confer on me &s;ince, with the readine&s;s you have ever expre&s;t of encouraging all ingenious Inquiries, have emboldened me to give you this Interruption. The de&s;ire al&s;o I under|&s;tand you have expre&s;&s;ed to Mr. <HI>Robert Chapman</HI> an Apothecary of this City, of a better account of the Contents of the&s;e Waters, which hath hitherto I know not how, been too much neglected, and concerning which I have of late made &s;ome Ex|periments, hath further encouraged me only at pre|&s;ent to acquaint you, that about <HI>Michaelmas</HI> next, God willing, I &s;hall have a conveniency by a friend of mine, your Neighbour, to &s;end you the true Contents of all the Baths apart, which if you plea&s;e to examine, and honour me &s;o far as to return me your thoughts of the Ingredients, being doubtle&s;s a
<PB REF="10"> Compounded body, I &s;hall with all alacrity and ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s imaginable give you a larger account of my Ob&s;ervations, vvhich I forbear to do till you plea&s;e to favour me with an An&s;wer, that &s;o I may not preoccupy your more exact enquiry. The thing it &s;elf being of &s;o grand import, and &s;o well &s;uiting with your own genius, I may promi&s;e my &s;elf the greater happine&s;s in your Corre&s;pondence, &amp;c. which is all the trouble &s;hall at this time be given by</P>

<P>According to this Letter, I &s;ent the Doctor what I promi&s;ed, on the <HI>15.</HI> of <HI>October</HI> next en&s;uing, by my facetious, learned, good friend, Mr. <HI>Alexander Dyer,</HI> with this Letter, which becau&s;e it contains the rude draught of what I afterwards took more pains about, and not much different from what I now publi&s;h, I &s;hall here in&s;ert.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HEaring nothing of <HI>Colonel Morgan,</HI> the Per&s;on I de&s;igned for conveyance of what I for|merly promi&s;ed, I have now met with a conveni|ent opportunity by my vvorthy friend Mr. <HI>Alex. Dyer</HI> to pre&s;ent you with as true an Anatomy of the Baths, as my pre&s;ent in&s;pection will permit: <HI>viz.</HI> The Contents of all the Baths, <HI>Kings, Cro&s;s</HI> and <HI>Hot,</HI> in Iron and Gla&s;s Ve&s;&s;els; the former &ounce;i. of each, the latter &ounce;ii. or thereabouts; that in Gla&s;s being all that one Gallon of the Water of each Bath did afford; the other in Iron, not the whole quantity,
<PB REF="10"> but &s;ufficient, I hope, for your &s;atisfaction, that came from four Gallons, the <HI>Kings Bath</HI> yielding in Iron, on my fir&s;t Experiment &dram;xiiii; the <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> &dram;xii &s;s; the <HI>Hot</HI> &ounce;ix. &scruple;ii: but on my &s;econd Trial performed in the late wet weather, much le&s;s out of the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el, and quantity of water, which may &s;ugge&s;t &s;omething to Enquiry if I find it hold. But u&s;ually out of 4 Gallons in a Ve&s;&s;el of mixt Mettal, I commonly evaporate it in, I have &ounce;i. out of a gallon of all the Baths alike, &s;o that I judge about &dram;ii. to be the common proportion out of a gallon the Water will afford.</P>
<P>Now of the&s;e &dram;ii, as I &s;uppo&s;e, you will ea&s;ily di&s;cover all is not Salt, but according to my be&s;t ob&s;ervation I find a third part only Saline, or &scruple;ii. in &dram;ii: the re&s;idue, which I have &s;ent under the name of <HI>Re&s;iduum Sedimenti non Salinum,</HI> will not relent but continues of a gritty nature, and I &s;uppo&s;e, con&s;i&s;ts of two different &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ochre</HI> ari&s;eth in a large quantity, where the &s;tream of the Bath meets with any re&s;i&s;tance; but what I am not &s;o fully &s;atisfied in for the pre&s;ent is, that though &s;o much continually is breathed out of the water, nothing yellow is di&s;covered in the Con|tents.</P>
<P>The <HI>Oleum Salis Thermarum per deliquium,</HI> is only that Salt I have &s;ent you by the name of <HI>Sal Thermarum</HI> relented in the air, and clean&s;ed from impurities that will &s;ub&s;ide, but tincted greeni&s;h by a touch of Copper it met with in extracting, when otherwi&s;e the true colour is more inclining to Amber.</P>
<P>One thing more al&s;o I think fit to adverti&s;e you of, that in Gla&s;s Ve&s;&s;els there is a thin cru&s;t in the out&s;ide covering that part that is mo&s;t Saline, as thin as the thinne&s;t Wafer, but not Salt at all,
<PB REF="11"> which I have cau&s;ed to be &s;eparated in the Con|tents of the <HI>Hot Bath,</HI> and put in a di&s;tinct gla&s;s containing &dram;i. gr. 10; this more flakey and much le&s;s, if at all Saline, being only &scruple;ii. gr. 14. The <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Cro&s;s Bath</HI> are alike, mixed here in one gla&s;s, only the <HI>Hoth Bath</HI> &s;eparated for your further &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>You have al&s;o the Sand, Mud, and Scum, in Boxes by them&s;elves, all which I &s;ubmit to your more exact &s;crutiny what names to call the&s;e by, which is the grand thing in que&s;tion, and <HI>on which will be built, as I conceive, the true&s;t Hypothe&s;is of the Nature and Vertues of the&s;e Waters that hath yet been given, and much different from what hath hi|therto been &s;uppo&s;ed and pre&s;umed on.</HI></P>
<P>I hope to have the honour of a few lines from you, what your thoughts are of the nature of the&s;e particulars, vvhich vvill be very acceptable to</P>

<P>IN an ordinary infu&s;ion of any of the Contents in Common Water, you will ob&s;erve a white gritty &s;ub&s;tance, which will harden into a &s;tone in the bot|tom of the gla&s;s, one of which I have &s;ent in the Box containing <HI>Sedimentum non Salinum;</HI> above that a blewi&s;h light, and more dirty &s;ub&s;tance; then the Salt in the Water to which it gives a yellow tin|cture.</P>
<PB REF="11">
<P>The Doctors bu&s;ine&s;s being much on other accounts, I cannot under&s;tand he did any thing in this, only in a Latin Letter he had occa&s;ion to write me not long after, on the account of an Honourable Patient, for whom we then were both concern'd he takes a very kind notice of my Letters, and Experiments, and gives me thanks in this expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Clari&s;&s;ime Domine, Multum Tibi debeo pro Litteris &amp; Experimentis Tuis circa Aquas Thermales mihi jam pridem mi&s;|&s;is, quae officia Tua ut grati&s;&s;ima habeo, ita compen|&s;are &s;tudebo;</HI> but &s;ent me no other &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>A little after, having an opportunity of obtaining the Contents of many Hog&s;heads of the Water, I wrought them all of, and came to an exact &s;eparation and di&s;tinction of Particulars, as expre&s;sed in the Ob|&s;ervations hereunto annexed, and as occa&s;ion &s;erved, com|municated my Experiments to my Honoured friends, the Learned and accompli&s;ht Sr. <HI>Charles Scarbo|rough,</HI> Doctor <HI>Thomas Witherley,</HI> Dr. <HI>Nathaniel Highmore,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Thomas Harbech.</HI> This I think is &s;ufficient to take off the &s;urmi&s;e of Singularity, if any &s;uch thing by chance &s;hould be thought upon.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but admire how a Judicious man &s;hould be &s;o far impo&s;ed on by any per&s;on what|&s;oever, as to imagine, that a &s;atisfactory enquiry into the nature of the&s;e Waters was &s;o nice a &s;peculation, as to be <HI>inconvenient</HI> or <HI>u&s;ele&s;s</HI> [according to the&s;e words; <HI>I have been de&s;irous heretofore to have attempted &s;ome di&s;covery of our Baths,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jord.</HI> Nat. Bath, c. <HI>17.</HI> in fin. p. <HI>147.</HI></NOTE> <HI>according to tho&s;e Principles: but being thought (by &s;ome) either not convenient, or not u&s;eful, I was willing to &s;ave my labour, which perhaps might have &s;eem|ed not to be worth thanks.]</HI> For, what can be more nece&s;sary, and therefore u&s;eful and convenient too, than to know the Principles of any Water we recom|mend our Patients to? and what did all the Mineral
<PB REF="12"> Writers that treated of &s;uch Waters before him who&s;e authority he u&s;es, but either make &s;uch enquiries, or &s;peak by gue&s;s? and which of the&s;e two is the more u&s;eful or convenient, is ea&s;ily determin'd.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, by this means we act as rational Phy&s;icians, and free the Baths and Mineral Waters from that a&s;per&s;ion they labour under, of being accounted Em|pirical Medicines, whereas they are the exact compo|&s;ition of the be&s;t Phy&s;ician, and perform their opera|tions by virtue of the Ingredients they con&s;i&s;t of, and the ble&s;&s;ing of God Almighty, as all other good Medi|cines and Pre&s;criptions do.</P>
<P>Moreover, this way we can better judge of the rea|&s;on of the effects, which without this, perplex the un|der&s;tanding with an ignorant admiration, and we prove no better than the ordinary Spectators at a Puppet-play, who admire the motions, but know no|thing of the hand within that occa&s;ions them.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s indeed, <HI>his thinking his pains might not have de&s;erved thanks,</HI> might &s;omewhat di&s;courage him; but a man of Re&s;olution would have con&s;idered that things of this kind, &s;ubjected to publick view, would fall either into the hands of under&s;tanding, ge|nerous and unbia&s;t per&s;ons; or el&s;e ignorant, &s;elf-intere&s;ted, and narrow Souls: the former ever have been, and will be ever ready to give what encourage|ment ingenuity &s;hall de&s;erve; and for the other, they are not much to be regarded, being be&s;t brought to a knowledge of them&s;elves by an under&s;tanding of their errors; and as their mouths are no &s;landers, &s;o their thanks are but &s;lender, if any, commendations. And thanks be to God for it, there have been and now are many worthy, brave, and generous Spirits in this our Nation, who can di&s;cern and make di&s;tinction 'twixt things that differ, el&s;e had would be the condition ef tho&s;e that have broken through that oppo&s;ition at
<PB REF="12"> which others have boggled, and think it no di&s;parage|ment to undergo rude Cen&s;ures from the ruder multi|tude, in pro&s;ecution of a de&s;ign for publick advantage.</P>
<P>Although the Credit of the Waters hath been pre|&s;erved by Bathing, and advanced by Drinking, e&s;pe|cially the&s;e two Summers la&s;t pa&s;t, yet a far greater degree of Reputation may be acquired, by a more par|ticular account of the more remarkable Cures that are annually wrought, principally thereby; which be|ing dige&s;ted into the nature of a Regi&s;ter, would mightily conduce to the &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e that &s;eek remedy here in the like di&s;tempers. And although I have endeavoured what in me lay to promote &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary a good work, yet &s;uch is the &s;tupidity of &s;ome to things of their own advantage, that nothing of this nature hath yet been performed, although recom|mended by the learned Doctor <HI>Jorden,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">N. B. <HI>Ch.</HI> 18. <HI>in fin. p.</HI> 163.</NOTE> then practi&s;ing on the place, and often inculcated, though with like &s;ucce&s;s, by my &s;elf: So that to the wonderful honour of tho&s;e on whom it mu&s;t reflect, the Waters have been more beholding to the gratitude of Forreigners in regi&s;tring their own Ca&s;es, than to the care and duty of tho&s;e that are at home. I &s;hall in&s;tance in the Ca&s;e of Sr. <HI>Humphrey Lloyd,</HI> who having received a hurt in his Hip, hy the kick of a hor&s;e in <HI>Milain,</HI> was grievou&s;ly afflicted with a Sciatica for a twelve months time, and after having made u&s;e of much Phy&s;ick, from &s;everal Phy&s;icians, to little purpo&s;e, in only &s;ix daies u&s;ing the&s;e Waters was perfectly recovered. His words are the&s;e; <HI>Alia</HI> Belgarum <HI>urbs,</HI> Ptolomaeo,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fragm.

<P>And that I may mention one fre&s;h in the memory of all, who&s;e gratitude in this kind de&s;erves a remem|brance, Mr. <HI>John Revet,</HI> an aged man, hath very late|ly publickly te&s;tified his cure of an <HI>Hemiplegia,</HI> in a months bathing, by an In&s;cription round a very fair Bra&s;s ring, on the right hand of the Entrance into the Queens Bath out of the Kings, after this manner; <HI>Thanks to God. I</HI> John Revet <HI>his Maje&s;ties Bra|zier, at 56 years of age, in this pre&s;ent month of</HI> July <HI>1674, in this place recovered a cure of health and limbs, of the</HI> Dead Pal&s;ey, <HI>on one &s;ide, from head to foot.</HI></P>
<P>That this way of Regi&s;tring of Cures was al&s;o thought nece&s;&s;ary, and recommended before the time of Dr. <HI>Jorden,</HI> may appear from the words of Mr. <HI>Jones,</HI> an hone&s;t <HI>Cambrobritan</HI> (who&s;e authority I am con&s;trained to make often u&s;e of in the following di&s;cour&s;e, in regard he is the only man that hath treat|ed any thing largely of the&s;e Waters,) which I re|cite as they are, being the plain words of an hone&s;t meaning man.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bathes A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">d, <HI>lib.</HI> 4. <HI>fol.</HI> 33.</NOTE> <HI>I wi&s;h&punc;</HI> &s;aith he <HI>that you leave a Note of the Commodity received, and a knowledge of your condition and calling in the Records of the Mayor of the City, where it &s;hall be regi&s;tred, until a Phy&s;ician be appointed, who then &s;hall be joyned with the Mayor, paying to the Poor-man's Box, and 4 pence for Regi&s;tring your benefit received there.</HI> [And in another place;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Buxtons Benefit, <HI>fol.</HI> 22.</NOTE>] <HI>Alway provided the day of your coming thither be noted before you enter into the Baths, and the day of your departure, with the Country of your habitation, condition, or cal|ling, with the Infirmities or cau&s;e you came for, in the Regi&s;ter book kept of the Warden of the Bath,
<PB REF="13"> or the Phy&s;ician that there &s;hall be appointed, and the benefit you received, paying four pence for the Recording.</HI> This Regi&s;ter may be &s;o contriv'd as that the Patients name, or only letters thereof, as &s;hall be thought expedient, with thir place of re&s;idence, di&s;tem|per, and time of u&s;ing the Waters, may be expre&s;t in &s;hort; a model whereof, in many in&s;tances, we have in <HI>Jo. Bauhinus</HI> de Aquis <HI>Bollen&s;ibus,</HI> lib. <HI>1.</HI> cap. <HI>17.</HI></P>
<P>And whereas mention is here made of the Poor-man's Box, it gives me a good occa&s;ion to remind this Age, of what prudent and charitable di&s;po&s;ition the former Age was, in which for the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport of the many Poor that came hither for relief, (now &s;ufficiently numerous, and burthen&s;om too) Repara|tions and Conveniences of the Bath, and other good u&s;es, a Tax, or Pole-bill was made, and willingly con|&s;ented to by the u&s;ers of &s;uch Waters, by which a cer|tain rea&s;onable rate, or &s;um, was required of every man or woman of all conditions, from a Duke to a Yeoman, by which all Clamours, now too frequent, were prevented, and all occa&s;ions of Exactions taken away, no per&s;on paying, or requiring more than what was commonly known to be their due, re&s;erving their Gratuities to di&s;po&s;e of as they plea&s;e. The mony collected to be put into the Trea&s;ury of the Bath, and intru&s;ted in the hands of one or two hone&s;t and &s;uf|ficient per&s;ons, who &s;hould every <HI>Michaelmas</HI> give up their Accounts, and di&s;po&s;e of good part of the mony chiefly to the u&s;e of the poor abroad that come with good Certificates, or accounts of their condition, to be approved of by competent Judges in this ca&s;e, and other nece&s;sary, good, and charitable u&s;es, as &s;hall be thought requi&s;ite; provided the Baths, Pumps, or any of their appurtenances be &s;upply'd, and kept in good order and repair. And this was never intended in any violent or compul&s;ory way, but only as a fair pro|po&s;al
<PB REF="14"> to the better di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons, who by their good example, and readine&s;s to comply in this particular, may have an efficacious influence on the more captious and excepting, to beget in them a better under&s;tand|ing of this charitable, and orderly de&s;ign.</P>
<P>Neither can this Tax in rea&s;on be imagin'd to be prejudicial to the Waters, as &s;ome others are reported to have been; on the impo&s;ition of which the Waters are &s;aid to have lo&s;t their virtue: for however the truth of &s;uch &s;tories may be admitted, which are de|liver'd by credible Authors, and I cannot contradict, yet certain it is, that if any &s;uch thing ever hap|pen'd, it was either on the re&s;traint of a publick re|&s;ort, by denying Poor people the u&s;e of the Waters, or el&s;e by an Impo&s;t collected by the Officers of the Prince to his private advantage; whereas this is only to pre|vent exactions, and moral abu&s;es, between man and man, and the Poor rather hence to be relieved than exacted of, with a probability of a much greater re|&s;ort that will be procured by a rea&s;onable demand, and good order withal.</P>
<P>The overplus of this Collection, if rightly manag'd, and the years prove lucky, may in a &s;hort time, make a pur&s;e for the covering one or two of the Baths al&s;o, whereby the Waters would be rendred u&s;eful all the year, which hy rea&s;on of the coldne&s;s of the ambient Air, and fear of injury thereby, and no other, are thought not &s;o fit to be u&s;ed in the Winter &s;ea&s;on, the Waters then being as effectual as in Summer.</P>
<P>And this would be agreeable to the u&s;e and cu&s;tom of mo&s;t of the Baths in <HI>Europe</HI> which are cover'd, and thought by the be&s;t Phy&s;icians to be a means of keeping the Waters to an even Temper, being an equal defence again&s;t the wind and cold of the Winter, and the trouble&s;om heat of the Sun in Summer; &s;o that nothing external cau&s;ing alteration &s;upervening, the
<PB REF="14"> benefit of the Waters may be &s;afely received from the fir&s;t of <HI>January,</HI> to the la&s;t of <HI>December,</HI> which would be much for the relief of tho&s;e infirm per&s;ons that require a longer &s;tay than ordinary here, and by their &s;o long ab&s;ence from the Bath, do but weave <HI>Pe|nelope</HI>'s web, undoing in the Winter, what is done in Summer; whereas if they did in this manner, as we &s;ay, follow their blows, they probably would not only prevent a relap&s;e, but &s;et them&s;elves in a way of perfect recovery with one re&s;olution, without many comings at &s;everal &s;ea&s;ons, being many times not &s;o well at their &s;econd coming, as they went away on their fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on of bathing.</P>
<P>For this u&s;e I think the Queens Bath mo&s;t con|venient, both in regard it is but &s;mall, and al&s;o more e&s;pecially for the conveniences of the Slips, and Hou|&s;es about it, where it is almo&s;t no more than out of Bath, into Bed; and if well cover'd, and care taken in ri&s;ing, may be as well as if a man made u&s;e of a Bath in his own hou&s;e or Chamber where he lies. After which the Cro&s;s Bath may follow, if it be thought fit, the Kings, and Hot, being kept open &s;till.</P>
<P>But again&s;t this I fore&s;ee two Objections will be made. Fir&s;t, <HI>That it will be inconvenient in the Summer time to &s;it &s;o clo&s;e, if no offence doth a|ri&s;e from the &s;team.</HI> And, Secondly, <HI>That it will be injurious to the Lights about the Bath.</HI></P>
<P>To the fir&s;t, I an&s;wer generally; That tho&s;e per|&s;ons that de&s;ire good, will think nothing an inconve|nience that is in order to it, and tho&s;e that come for plea&s;ure may be &s;omewhere el&s;e; yet that it may ap|pear to be made out &s;ome other way, I &s;uppo&s;e the increa&s;e of Heat, which &s;ometimes that Bath wants, procured by keeping the Air out, and the &s;team in great mea&s;ure in, (which yet will not be more than
<PB REF="15"> will well be endured) will make a &s;ufficient recom|pence for this &s;uppo&s;ed mole&s;tation. And as for the Steam, a vent hole, or Tunnel at the top, will &s;o di&s;|charge, that it may not be offen&s;ive or trouble&s;ome at all.</P>
<P>As to the Lights, the Cro&s;s Bath will certainly inconvenience none, and the Queens may be &s;o con|triv'd, if made flat, as to do the &s;ame but if built more erect for gaining room below, there will be but a very little blind, or perhaps none at all, to the lower Windows on the <HI>Hart</HI> lodging &s;ide, which hou&s;e, by rea&s;on of the accommodation of the Slip thereunto belonging, being, in all probability, likely to partake mo&s;t of the profit, may contribute a little in this kind. But to avoid all exception, the Cover may be &s;o made with &s;hutters on a Timber frame, that it may be ea&s;ily taken off if there be occa&s;ion, and as &s;oon clo&s;ed up again, if nece&s;&s;ity &s;hall require.</P>
<P>One thing more I &s;hall only add, which as a means to e&s;tabli&s;h greater order and content, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to more political judgments, I here propo&s;e, That I con|ceive that the per&s;ons having dependance more imme|diately on the Bath, may be better paid by Salaries, than the <HI>Nunquam-&s;atis-arbitrary</HI> way now on foot; That their number may be le&s;&s;en'd, being by that rea|&s;on, and (the con&s;equent thereof) their nece&s;&s;ity, only &s;uch as repine at now, and prey one upon another; and that two Serjeants, four able men to manage the Pumps, and clean&s;e the Baths, four Women to intro|duce and place the Females; with twelve Chair-men, may be &s;ufficient. The Salaries to be paid them by the Officer in chief, collected by the Serjeant, and rai&s;ed by a moderate demand by the Pole from the &V;&s;ers of the Waters, according to their conditions, quality, and time of &s;tay at the Bath, expre&s;&s;ed in a Table for that purpo&s;e mentioned before; and if any
<PB REF="15"> other clamorous demands, uncivil deportment, neglect, or want of duty, &s;hould at any time happen in tho&s;e Servants, upon complaint made, to be animadverted on, &s;u&s;pended, or di&s;charged by the Authority under which they are. The&s;e things &s;ome may make light of, but the Prudent will con&s;ider.</P>

<HEAD>A Di&s;cour&s;e of BATHE, AND THE HOT WATERS There.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. I.</HI> The Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>_HAving formerly, in the year 1668, annexed a brief di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Bathe</HI> to one of Doctor <HI>Jorden</HI>'s of Natu|ral Bathes and Mineral Waters, un|der the name of an <HI>Appendix con|cerning Bathe,</HI> by which and &s;ome other pains I had taken about the Treati&s;e it &s;elf, I thought I had obliged (as was the opinion of mo&s;t) not only the Relations of the decea&s;ed Au|thor, but all his Friends and Well-wi&s;hers; but meeting, contrary to all expectation, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ude and unhand&s;om returns from an Impudent per&s;on, to
<PB N="2" REF="18"> who&s;e Temper the mode&s;t Doctour was a great &s;tranger, and of who&s;e behaviour he would be much a&s;ham'd, were he now alive; who on his pretended relation hath repaid me with ill lan|guage, and fooli&s;hly threatned me with Trouble for my good will. Now to put an end to all di&s;putes of this kind, I have thought fit to appeal to any under&s;tanding per&s;on, that hath his &s;en&s;es exerci&s;ed, and his wits about him, (for all have not, and &s;ome have none at all) whether my Additions have been any impair to the Doctor's Reputation, whom I have treated with all the Civility imaginable; and for the Sale of the Book (a good argument of its acceptance) I believe there were not more &s;old in the Doctor's life time, of what he printed him&s;elf, than went off the fir&s;t year of my Impre&s;&s;ion. But to &s;ilence all Cavils and &s;illy Objections of this nature, I have di&s;charged that Author, and publi&s;hed in this di&s;cour&s;e my own thoughts and Ob&s;ervations, and how much different they are from his, or agreeable to Truth, may be&s;t be de|termin'd by the ingenious Reader.</P>
<P>I did intend indeed, according to my Promi&s;e in the end of my Preface to the Edition of Dr. <HI>Jorden,</HI> to have amplified that &s;mall di&s;cour&s;e into an <HI>Hi&s;tory of Bathe;</HI> but finding no encouragement &s;ince to that de|&s;ign, and many things that have made me alter my re&s;olution, my intentions are to wave that, and apply my &s;elf, in &s;ome convenient time, to the <HI>Roman Court,</HI> where I &s;hall have a fairer Trial, and more Ju&s;tice done me. In the mean time, I hope this may in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;top the gap, and relea&s;e me of my obligation to the Candid world; e&s;pecially con&s;i|dering that the Antiquities of the Baths and City can hardly, I think, be improved higher, and the My&s;tery of the Sacred Waters of <HI>Minerva,</HI> is not
<PB N="3" REF="18"> to be profan'd, which it wants little of if idly pro|&s;tituted to vulgar Capacities; which, be&s;ides that they are incompetent Judges in other matters, are apt to put a &s;ini&s;ter interpretation on tho&s;e very things, that really are, and were &s;o intended for their own advantage; neither had I publi&s;hed the Ob&s;ervations I now do in this language, had it not been on a more particular account.</P>
<P>The ill U&s;ages and great Indignities I have al|ready met withal, from an ungrateful people, in the pro&s;ecution of my de&s;ign of making further En|quiries into the Nature of tho&s;e Waters, are not here to be mentioned; they are &s;ufficiently known to be products of Envy and Malice, and as I have hitherto contemned what pitiful oppo&s;ition could be made again&s;t me by the united &s;trength of En|vy, Pride, Beggery and Revenge; &s;o I &s;hall not &s;urcea&s;e my Thoughts in due time of performing that which will be better e&s;teem'd by more Judici|ous per&s;ons, and render me and my de&s;ign mo&s;t acceptable when be&s;t under&s;tood. It was a fit re|turn of a grave Divine to a vainglorious oppo&s;er of his good Inclinations, <HI>Nec propter Te coepi, nec propter Te de&s;inam. Thou, Satan,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>ha&s;t nothing to do with my Concerns, for thou art at neither end of my de&s;ign; and as I did not begin to do thee a kindne&s;s, &s;o I will continue notwith&s;tanding thy rage.</HI> Such unclean Spirits have no more to do with pub|lick affairs, than to interrupt the quiet of better than them&s;elves; and are like a trouble&s;om Curr on the Road, that doth little el&s;e, with a be&s;om tail and a whiffling bark, than make a man well mount|ed look back, his hor&s;e kick, and &s;o returns.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> The Opinion of a late Author concerning the Nature of the Baths of <HI>Bathe.</HI></HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Joh. May|ow</HI> LL. D. &amp; Med.</NOTE>AND here I cannot but take notice of a Novel Writer, who Magi&s;terially thus determines: <HI>Quod ad Nitrum &amp; Sulphur attinet, quibus Thermas Bathonien&s;es imbutas e&s;&s;e hactenus creditum e&s;t, eorum neutrum Aquis Thermarum i&s;tarum &s;olutum e&s;&s;e arbi|tror: As to what concerns Nitre and Sulphur, with which the Bathes of Bathe have hitherto been thought to be impregnated, I &s;uppo&s;e there is nothing of either of them di&s;&s;olved in the Waters.</HI></P>
<P>A bold a&s;&s;ertion! which had it been vented and believed but 50 years ago, would have prevented much trouble in evincing the contrary; but, &s;ince 'tis in fa&s;hion to be peremptory, I do a&s;&s;ert, <HI>That both Nitre and Sulphur are to be found in all the Bathes of Bathe, and that di&s;&s;olved in, and mixed with, the Body of the Waters.</HI> In order to the Proof of which, I &s;hall take &s;ome account of the forementioned Author's 15th. Chapter of his Tract of Sal-Nitre, the arguments he hath again&s;t it, and his opinion to the contrary.</P>
<P>His words therefore, as well as I can tran&s;late them, are the&s;e:</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P>Among the mo&s;t celebrated Bathes, we may ju&s;tly reckon tho&s;e of <HI>Bathe,</HI> in which admirable Waters, a continual Ve&s;tal and &s;acred Fire is maintain'd, as if things of a mo&s;t different na|ture were interleagu'd. Before I come to the manner how the&s;e Bathes receive their Heat, it will not be improper if I make &s;ome enquiry into the Contents of the&s;e Waters.</P>
<PB N="7" REF="20">
<P>It is therefore manife&s;t, that the Bathes of <HI>Bathe</HI> are impregnated with a certain Salt of an acid na|ture, for if any Sal alkali, or volatil Salt purely &s;alin'd, be mixed with the&s;e Waters, a precipita|tion will en&s;ue, and the Waters will become tur|bid, and of a milky nature.</P>
<P>Moreover, The <HI>Bathe</HI>-water powred on boyl|ing Milk, will coagulate it, as any other acid doth.</P>
<P>Neither doth this acid Salt &s;eem to be the only Salt of the <HI>Bathe,</HI> but is complicated with an Al|kali; for if the Water be evaporated quite away, a certain Salt of a more fixt nature will be found in the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el, which, on the powr|ing of any acid on it, will ferment.</P>
<P>Of the &s;ame nature al&s;o are the Mud and Sand of the Bathe, which are wrought up with the Springs; for any acid liquor being powred on them, an Ebullition will follow.</P>
<P>There may be al&s;o ob&s;erved in the&s;e Waters a Salt, or rather a Lime-Chalk kind of Earth, &s;ticking to the bottom of the Gouts, or pa&s;&s;ages, almo&s;t in all places where the Water pa&s;&s;eth.</P>
<P>From what hath been &s;aid may be collected; That the Bathes of <HI>Bathe</HI> are impregnated with a certain acid &s;aline Salt, and the Salt of the Bathe &s;eems not much unlike Tartar vitriolated, or Aluminous Salt.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on why the&s;e Salts de&s;troy not one another, but each of them ferments with its con|trary Salt; may be under&s;tood from what hath been delivered in the former Chapter: To wit; The&s;e Salts are &s;o imperfect, that in Conjunction they cannot de&s;troy one another. But more of the&s;e Salts, hereafter.</P>
<P>As to Nitre and Sulphur, with which the Bathes
<PB N="8" REF="21"> have hitherto been thought to participate, I &s;up|po&s;e, That neither of them is di&s;&s;olv'd in tho&s;e Waters.</P>
<P>That there is no Nitre in the Waters appears by this, That the Salts that remain after the Eva|poration of the Bathe-water, put on a Coal, burn not, as Nitre doth. Although I &s;hall not deny, that tho&s;e immature Salts of an Alkali nature, (which are al&s;o contained in the Sand, and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">If that be meant by <HI>Fimus</HI> in the Au|thor, to expre&s;s which, <HI>Limus</HI> or <HI>Lutum</HI> had been more proper.</NOTE> Mud of the Bathe) being expos'd &s;ometime to the air, may, perhaps, by its influence be converted into Nitre.</P>
<P>As to Sulphur, which hath been &s;o much re|ported to be in all Bathes, 'tis not, I believe, di&s;&s;olved in the&s;e Waters. Becau&s;e,</P>
<P>If a Solution of Alom, Vitriol, or any other Salt, whether acid, or fixt, be mixed with the Water of the Bathe, Sulphur di&s;covers not it &s;elf to be precipitated, either by a fetid &s;mell, or any other &s;ign; which notwith&s;tanding in the Soluti|on of Sulphur in the water of un&s;lak't Lime, or made into a Lixivium, doth appear, where the Sulphur by the affu&s;ion of any acid Liquor is precipitated.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant that the Water of the&s;e Bathes, if Salt of Tartar, or a purely vola|til Salt, be ca&s;t into it, will pre&s;ently turn white, as is declared before; which colour proceeds not from Sulphur, but a &s;tony, or Aluminous matter precipitated, not much unlike to what is ob&s;erved in the Water of un&s;lak't Lime, when any fixt Salt is mixed therewith; in which notwith&s;tand|ing it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed the Sulphur is di&s;&s;olv|ed; for if Sulphur be boyled in Water of un|&s;lak't Lime, the Water becomes white, not by the affu&s;ion of a fixt Salt, as before, but of an
<PB N="9" REF="21"> acid; &s;o that fixt Salts may di&s;&s;olve Sulphur, but not precipitate it. Wherefore if Sulphur be contained in the Waters of the Bathe, they would be precipitated, not by a purely &s;aline, as former|ly, but an acid Salt, and the Sulphur &s;o precipi|tated would di&s;cover it &s;elf by a fetid &s;mell, which it doth not do.</P>
<P>To which I add, That an acid Salt, or &s;ome|thing Aluminous, doth &s;eem to predominate in the Bathes afore&s;aid, &s;o that they become altoge|ther unfit to di&s;&s;olve the Sulphur.</P>
<P>Moreover, If Common Sulphur be boyled in tho&s;e Waters, they are never tinged with a yellow or Sulphurous colour, neither can Sulphur, by any means, be precipitated from the decoction, as I have often experimented.</P>
<P>And therefore I much admire the famous <HI>Wil|lis,</HI> in his Treati&s;e of the heat of the Blood, &s;hould affirm, That Sulphur boyled in Bathe-wa|ter may be di&s;&s;olved after the &s;ame manner, as if boyled in Water of un&s;lak't Lime.</P>
<P>Now if Sulphur &s;eems to be di&s;&s;olved in the Waters afore&s;aid, the occa&s;ion of the mi&s;take, I &s;uppo&s;e to be, That the decoction was made in a ve&s;&s;el, in which &s;ome fixt Salt had been decocted, &s;o that the Solution of the Sulphur may be made by &s;ome particle of a fixt Salt, with which the ve&s;&s;el might be &s;ea&s;on'd.</P>
<P>Concerning the Baths of <HI>Bathe,</HI> 'Tis the com|mon Opinion that Silver dipped into them is co|loured yellow, in the &s;ame manner as if it were ca&s;t into a Solution of Sulphur, and hence it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the Baths have Sulphur in them; but experience evinceth the contrary; for Silver put into the Bath-water becomes not reddi&s;h, or yellow, but rather black.</P>
<PB N="10" REF="22">
<P>The mi&s;take may &s;eem to ari&s;e from this, That 'tis cu&s;tomary with the Bathe-Guids to tinge, and as it were guild over pieces of Silver with a Salino-Sulphurous Mud, or Dung, &s;uch as is often found in hou&s;es of Office, and put them off to Strangers, for a little profit, as if they were coloured with the Bathe-water.</P>
<P>And here this is to be noted, That a kind of Bituminous Mud, with a &s;mall pittance of Com|mon Sulphur, is brought up with the Springs, which only &s;wims on the top, or el&s;e continues at the bottom, but never is di&s;&s;olved in the Waters them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Neither is Sal Armoniack, as &s;ome imagine, to be found in the&s;e Waters; for if on the So|lution of Sal Armoniack, Salt of Tartar be in|jected, the purely &s;aline volatil Salt (of which Sal Armoniack in part doth con&s;i&s;t) being at li|berty from the acid Salt, to which it was former|ly united, will pre&s;ently fly off into the air, and will quickly be di&s;cover'd by a pungent affecting the no&s;trils, which is never ob&s;erv'd in the Bathe-waters.</P>
<P>La&s;tly; As to Vitriol, the Cro&s;&s;e and Hot Bathe &s;eem to have none at all; for if Galls are beaten, and infu&s;ed in the&s;e Waters, they nei|ther turn purple nor black; which would cer|tainly be, if the&s;e Waters had Vitriol in them.</P>
<P>The King's Bathe &s;eems to have a little Vitriol in it; for if &s;ome beaten Galls are ca&s;t into that Water, it will have a light tincture of a black purple colour.</P>
<P>'Tis al&s;o to be noted, That a certain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Minera,</HI> for <HI>Mine|rale,</HI> is corrupt|ly, though Chymi|cally, u&s;ed here</NOTE> Mineral of a Metallick nature, ari&s;eth out of the Earth, with the Springs of the Bathe, which is ea&s;ily turn'd into Vitriol. For if any acid liquor be
<PB N="11" REF="22"> affu&s;ed on the Sand (which breaking out with the Springs, is found in the bottom of the Bathe) it being corroded with an acid Men&s;truum, not without a remarkable efferve&s;cence, will in part be converted into Vitriol, ju&s;t as it happens to the filings of Iron corroded with an acid liquor.</P>
<P>For if that Sand of the Bathe corroded with an acid liquor, be put into the Infu&s;ion of Galls, the liquor acquires an atropurpureous colour. Whereas if the Infu&s;ion of Galls be put on the Sand newly taken out of the Bathe, and not cor|roded with an acid liquor, it will, by no means, be of a purple colour; an apparent &s;ign, that the Metallick Sand of the Bathe, unle&s;s corro|ded with an acid Men&s;truum, doth not turn to Vitriol.</P>
<P>It is further ob&s;ervable; That the Sand of the Bathe kept &s;ome time, and expo&s;ed to the open air, will of its own accord, be converted into Vitriol; for if that Sand be mixed with the Infu|&s;ion of Galls, the Water will contract an atro|purpureous appearance.</P>
<P>Moreover, If it be laid on the Tongue, it hath a perfect Vitriolick ta&s;te; and no wonder, for the Nitro-aereous Spirit, after &s;ome time, clo&s;eth with the Metallick Mineral, and Salino-Sulphureous Marcha&s;ite, of which Vitriol u&s;eth to be made, mixed in the Sand, and cau&s;eth it to ferment, and at la&s;t, as was &s;hewed before, con|verts it into Vitriol, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P></Q>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III.</HI> An Examination of &s;ome Particulars in the former Chapter.</HEAD>
<P>HOW far this Author hath ploughed with my Heifer, I leave to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e that have been any way acquainted with my de&s;ign; and &s;hall only here take notice, what Ob&s;ervations are agreeable with, or different from tho&s;e I have often made with the greate&s;t exactne&s;s, and repeat|ed Trials, &s;ubmitting all to the unbia&s;t judgment of Indifferent per&s;ons.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t of all, I concur with him, that the Baths of <HI>Bathe</HI> are in part impregnated with a certain Salt of an Acid nature; but why this acid Salt &s;hould be called <HI>Aluminous,</HI> I am not yet &s;o fully re&s;olv'd, as much on other accounts, &s;o &s;ome|what on this, That although an acid Spirit be in Alom, yet the mo&s;t perceptible ta&s;te is either <HI>acerbe</HI> or <HI>au&s;tere;</HI> which being not ob&s;erved in the&s;e Wa|ters, I have &s;o much rea&s;on to judge <HI>Alom</HI> not predominant, as a&s;&s;erted here.</P>
<P>The Experiment he mentions of precipitation or alteration of the Waters to a milky colour, or almond Milk, we owe to the Ingenuity of the In|du&s;trious Mr. <HI>Stubbe,</HI> who, though he had not the good hap to di&s;cover what was precipitated, yet gives it the general name of an <HI>in&s;ipid Magi&s;tery,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pl. ult. red.</HI> To a Non|pl. <HI>p.</HI> 135.</NOTE> and is nothing el&s;e but <HI>Free&s;tone</HI> finely wrought, and intimately mixt with the body of the Wa|ters.</P>
<P>If any blame me for calling it by &s;o homely a name, I de&s;ire they would con&s;ider, that I had
<PB N="13" REF="23"> rather call it &s;o than a Metallick Mineral, or a <HI>Sali|no-&s;ulphureous Marcha&s;ite,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing it more agreea|ble to all their apprehen&s;ions that will be concern'd in things of this nature, and whom I would not have abu&s;ed with hard names and uncouth ex|pre&s;&s;ions; the effect of O&s;tentation, or &s;anctuary of Ignorance.</P>
<P>That this is <HI>Free&s;tone</HI> appears by this, that 'tis in&s;ipid, gritty, &s;cowrs, leaves a white colour like Chalk on the fingers after it, and is inclinable to an union into a &s;tony con&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>That this is not <HI>Calx vive,</HI> or any <HI>lapis Calca|rius</HI> that holds affinity with it, I am much induced to believe from this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Ob&s;. <HI>83</HI></NOTE> That neither the In&s;ipid ma|gi&s;tery, nor the more gritty powder, being no|thing different but in finene&s;s and colour, will, either alone or together, open the body of Sul|phur, which is u&s;ual with <HI>Calx vive,</HI> as I have fully experimented by decocting two parts of the powders with one of Sulphur in a proportionable quantity of Water, which gave the water very lit|tle alteration, and as little was precipitated. To make it further evident, I calcin'd a large Cruci|ble of it with as &s;trong a fire as could well be given, yet nothing quick or limy did appear, but dead and gritty a&s;hes, which, mixed with water, neither made it white, nor created any di&s;turbance. But more of this in what will follow.</P>
<P>That the Bath-water will coagulate milk, I con|fe&s;s, but not as any other acid liquor doth; for this doth it &s;ooner upon affu&s;ion, and makes a hard curd; that with the Bath-water, mu&s;t boyl again and that pretty &s;martly, el&s;e a &s;oft white Curd, as commonly it is, will not appear.</P>
<P>I al&s;o agree with the forementioned Author in this, That there is a con&s;iderable quantity of
<PB N="14" REF="24"> an<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">&V;nder this Notion, I take the liberty to under&s;tand Common Salt, or <HI>Sal Mari|ne,</HI> con&s;o|nant to the proper no|tation of the word: for the Salt of <HI>Kali</HI> or <HI>Gla&s;&s;ewort</HI> is Marine, though u&s;ed indifferently by the Chymi&s;ts for the fixt Salt of any Vegetables, by Cal|cination.</NOTE> <HI>Alkalizate</HI> Salt, mixed with &s;ome other Salt in the body of the waters, and apparently di&s;tin|gui&s;hable by the ta&s;te, as well in a <HI>Lixivium</HI> made of the Contents of the waters, as in both the Cour&s;er part, the re&s;ult of the Evaporation, and al&s;o the purer part, when made white and refin'd; and that this <HI>Alkali</HI> doth con&s;titute good part of the Saline matter, with which the Baths are im|pregnated.</P>
<P>For I am apt to believe, that great part of the acidity is breath'd off in evaporation, either in the Bath or over the fire, or both ways together, in re|gard very little of that ta&s;te is perceptible in the Salt extracted, but the Saline is ea&s;ily di&s;cover'd. To the confirmation of which the acting al&s;o of acids on it may &s;omewhat conduce, and the expe|rience of many this Summer, who according to my directions have di&s;&s;olved the Salt in the Bath-water to improve it, and have &s;en&s;ibly found an in|crea&s;e in the other ta&s;te, but little or nothing at all in acidity.</P>
<P>Neither doth the <HI>Lixivium,</HI> though made very &s;trong, nor the <HI>Oleum per deliquium</HI> dropt 20, 30, or 40 drops into a &s;mall proportion of water, tinge with Galls either purple or black.</P>
<P>I may al&s;o urge as an Argument for the evapo|ration of <HI>Vitriol,</HI> the abundance of a yellow <HI>Ochre</HI> which a&s;cends with the &s;team of the Bath, and is there chiefly to be found where the &s;team of the Water meets with any re&s;i&s;tance, as I have noted el&s;ewhere, which probably may be the <HI>Terra Vi|trioli:</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="24"> And although 'tis not very ea&s;ie to give the rea&s;on, why the <HI>Vitriol</HI> &s;hould not be as vi&s;ible as the <HI>Ochre,</HI> or el&s;e make it more acid than we find it to be; yet if we conceive it to be in <HI>&s;ucco primiti|vo, aut Solutis principiis,</HI> and there <HI>per halitum,</HI> and &s;o <HI>per tran&s;itum</HI> too, it may better be conceived to go off, and not imbody as the other Salts do. Yet that all the Acidity is not breathed of, will appear from this, That the Bath-water cold will coagulate Milk. And what is more, the &s;ame water di&s;till'd from a gallon to a pint, a fourth part of that pint will make a curd, when the di&s;till'd water in the Receiver will do nothing at all: Which may pro|bably proceed either from &s;omething Vitrioline, or rather from the acidity of Sulphur, in regard the Salt made white, in which is nothing wanting but the Sulphur, will not coagulate, as the water doth; whereas the browner Salt before calcination, di&s;&s;ol|ved in Spring-water, will. So then, this <HI>Alkali</HI> is but one part of the fixt Salt, found in the bot|tom of the Ve&s;&s;el after evaporation <HI>ad &s;iccita|tem.</HI></P>
<P>For a further confirmation that an <HI>Alkali</HI> is contained in the waters, which, con&s;idering the Quantity that may continually be made evident both to light and ta&s;te, will &s;carcely be judged to need other demon&s;tration. Yet 'tis ob&s;ervable, that the Cro&s;s-Bath having lately been kept drawn four or five daies, the Saline matter not meeting with water &s;ufficient for its di&s;&s;olution, was driven up in &s;ub&s;tance from the Springs, and again reverberated by the ambient air, and incru&s;tated on the tops of the &s;tones that were above the water in the bottom of the Bath, which gave me &s;ome diverti&s;ement to behold, and, on examination, appeared much <HI>alkalizate</HI> both by ta&s;te and ignition; &s;ome pun|gency
<PB N="16" REF="25"> al&s;o I ob&s;erv'd in it, which I rather judg'd to proceed from the acrimony of <HI>Nitre</HI> than <HI>Tartar,</HI> but the predominant ta&s;te was clearly <HI>alkali&s;ate,</HI> which after the Nitrous parts were wa&s;ted, was le&s;s exceptionable in the remaining calx on the I|ron after burning, in which the Alkali&s;ate ta&s;te was mo&s;t remarkable; not to mention its crepitation, and that &s;ome pungency al&s;o is ob&s;erved in an <HI>Al|kali</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P>To make it further evident that this accretion did probably ari&s;e from the <HI>Minera,</HI> I believe, not far di&s;tant, and was not engendred or contracted from &s;ome floating particles in the air derived el&s;ewhere, and there &s;ettling by way of Magneti&s;m, as &s;ome may imagine; 'tis further remarkable, That nei|ther the &s;tones under water, nor, what is more ma|terial, any &s;tone either of the Seats, or in the &s;ides of the bottom of the Bath, remote from the water, had any Salt affixed to them, but only tho&s;e, as I may &s;o term it, that peeped out of the water, the tops of which only, as I &s;aid before, were incru|&s;tated. So that had a Magneti&s;m any place here, the Salino-Nitrous particles mu&s;t, I conceive, have lighted as well on the &s;tones of the &s;ame nature hard by, as where they were, the rea&s;on of the thing being much the &s;ame. For a fuller Te&s;timo|ny of this, <HI>See Ob&s;.</HI> 88.</P>
<P>I acknowledge al&s;o this, That a great Fermen|tation is produc'd by the affu&s;ion of Acids on the Sand and Mud of the Bath, (but do not tell you who fir&s;t ob&s;erv'd it) and a much le&s;s on the Scum; yet I mu&s;t be excus'd in this, if I &s;ay, That I cannot conceive how this &s;hould ari&s;e from the action of Acids on a Saline matter, in regard it tran&s;cends my under&s;tanding to apprehend, how any Salt can po&s;&s;ibly lie at the bottom of the Bath,

<P>'Tis a trivial Ob&s;ervation, that what is di&s;&s;olva|ble in any liquor, the pores of it will receive till it can hold no more; neither can I be yet per&s;waded, that there are ju&s;t &s;o many poro&s;ities in the Bath-water a&s;&s;igned for <HI>Vitriol,</HI> and the re&s;t taken up with other Bodies, &s;eeing the di&s;&s;olution of <HI>Vitriol</HI> in the Bath-water afterwards, and the alteration in ta&s;te that happens thereupon, is &s;ufficient to give me &s;atisfaction to the contrary.</P>
<P>But to &s;peak a little more to this, becau&s;e the Author in&s;i&s;ts &s;o much upon it; If any <HI>Vitriol</HI> be contained in the Sand, 'tis no ab&s;urdity to conceive that warm water may di&s;&s;olve it and fetch it out; now, if half a pint of warm water be poured on an ounce of Sand, with what agitation you &s;hall think convenient, and thus let &s;tand infu&s;ed ten or twelve hours, the water then decanted, and the &s;and dried and weighed again, there will be little wanting in the weight, abating for the <HI>Ochre,</HI> which ari&s;eth fir&s;t to the top, through the body of the wa|ter, much like white <HI>Vitriol,</HI> afterwards precipitates and &s;ettles at the bottom on the Sand, and is hardly pre&s;erved in the decantation.</P>
<P>The Ebullition therefore, on the affu&s;ion of acid liquors on the Sand, I conceive doth ari&s;e from &s;omewhat not Saline (if Ta&s;te be the judge) of which I &s;hall treat more at large by and by: So that the Sand and Salt are no further of the &s;ame nature, than as fermentation may ari&s;e upon different Commixtures. How this may be reconcil'd to the Experiment I &s;ometime made, of making Ink with Bath-water and Galls, and the Sand of the Bath, with other things which might have been
<PB N="18" REF="26"> no &s;mall encouragement to this opinion, I &s;hall have occa&s;ion in part to declare hereafter, but more when I find my An&s;wer is required.</P>
<P>As to the Salt, or rather, to u&s;e the new-made word, <HI>Calcineous</HI> kind of Earth, &s;ticking to the bottom of the Gouts and pa&s;&s;ages, almo&s;t in all places where the water pa&s;&s;eth, I was never yet &s;o happy, though I have &s;earched particularly to find any &s;uch thing.

<P>That the Fermentation on the affu&s;ion of Acids on the Sand, ari&s;eth chiefly from the acting of that liquor on <HI>Free&s;tone</HI> in conjunction with &s;ome Te|&s;taceous particles, and not from any other Saline matter, &s;eems evident from this; That whereas the&s;e parts with a blew Clay or Marle, Rubrica, Ochre, and Chry&s;tal-pebbles, are clearly di&s;tin|gui&s;hable by a Magnifying-gla&s;s in the Sand, when the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> liquor hath done its wor&s;t, and the dif|ference

<P>And whereas the Mud of the Bath, which &s;eems chiefly to con&s;i&s;t of this blew Clay or Marle, with &s;omething Sulphurous, will do the like; the Fermentation I conceive doth ari&s;e not &s;o much, though &s;omething I confe&s;s, from the Earth it &s;elf, as the Te&s;taceous particles with which it a|bounds, in which Earth nothing Saline can be di&s;covered to which the ebullition may make any pretence.</P>
<P>To this may be added; That the colour of the Acid liquor, after Saturation by the Sand, is altogether the &s;ame with what ari&s;eth from the <HI>Free&s;tone,</HI> both equally re&s;embling the infu&s;ion of the filings of Steel; &s;o that in this al&s;o there is an agreement.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of <HI>Nitre</HI> in the Bath-Water.</HEAD>
<P>THat <HI>Nitre</HI> is contained in the Body of the Waters is evident from this, that it may, by art, be extracted thence; and I may as well &s;u&s;|pect, and, if I plea&s;e, believe, that I had not mo|ny in my pocket, when I took out &s;ome &s;ilver for a nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e; as when I &s;ee <HI>Nitre</HI> taken out of the Bath, &s;ay it was never there.</P>
<P>But the difficulty will be to prove the thing; now, I &s;ay, a <HI>Sceptick</HI> may doubt whether a Man be a Man, a Brute a Brute, or whether he makes u&s;e of his voice that asks the Que&s;tion; but whe|ther he be not the wi&s;er man that takes the&s;e for granted, and not pragmatically contradicts the u|nanimous con&s;ent of Judicious Writers, is ea&s;ie to determine.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s it burns not as Common <HI>Salt-Peter</HI> doth, becau&s;e it leaves a Calx behind it; but in that more re&s;embles the <HI>Nitre</HI> of the Ancients, a pound of which being burnt will leave four ounces of A&s;hes:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jord. <HI>Nat. Bath. &amp; Min. Wat.</HI> chap. 7. p. 53.</NOTE> <HI>Salt-Peter</HI> will leave none.</P>
<P>Neither doth it huff, nor melt altogether in a &s;mall quantity as <HI>Salt-Peter</HI> doth, on the account of an allay it receives from the mixture of ano|ther Salt of an <HI>Alkali&s;ate</HI> ta&s;te with &s;ome bitter|ne&s;s withal, which remains on the Iron-plate after accen&s;ion, and is little more than a fourth part of the Body; wherefore to deny the being of <HI>Nitre</HI> in the Salt, becau&s;e 'tis not all &s;o, is as ab&s;urd, to make a Lin&s;ey-wool&s;ey Compari&s;on, as to affirm, there is no Woollen in that &s;ort of Ve&s;ture where
<PB N="21" REF="27"> Linnen is; or to &s;ay, That a man that is both Lawyer and Phy&s;ician, hath nothing of Phy&s;ick, becau&s;e he hath &s;omething of Law.</P>
<P>But that <HI>Nitre</HI> is there, though not predominant, &s;eems clear by the &s;hooting in <HI>&s;tiria's,</HI> which is concluded to be the proper form of that Salt; and although <HI>Tartar,</HI> and perhaps &s;ome other Salts, may &s;omewhat re&s;emble it; yet the diffe|rence is ea&s;ily perceptible by the &s;ight, but more by the ta&s;te.</P>
<P>And now I am di&s;cour&s;ing of this matter, I conceive the Author did not hit the mark, becau&s;e he did not make the Bath-water &s;hoot, in that he only mentions, <HI>the Salts that remain after evapora|tion, which,</HI> he &s;ays, <HI>put on a Coal, burn not as Nitre doth.</HI> But the &s;hootings &s;o called, in a fi|gure &s;omewhat pyramidal, with many <HI>Columellae,</HI> or &s;mall pillars clo&s;ely united, put on a red-hot Iron-plate, and &s;o burnt, may alter the ca&s;e, which I affirm to do, as I mention'd before.</P>
<P>And, what is not a little con&s;iderable, on the burning of &s;ix ounces of the Chry&s;tals, in order to the Examination of the remaining Calx, the Nitrous parts of the &s;hoots, being many in number, in a &s;hort time melted, and ran down both &s;ides of the Iron-plate in a &s;tream, con&s;onant to <HI>Pliny</HI>'s ob|&s;ervation of <HI>Nitre,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">(Q)</NOTE> which he affirms <HI>ingentibus ri|vulis profluxi&s;&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>To which I may add the bitter Ta&s;te apparent|ly di&s;coverable in the Salt, in&s;omuch as to bring it within the verge of a &s;u&s;picious appearance of a <HI>Sal amarum</HI> (if any &s;uch Salt there be di&s;tinct from <HI>Nitre</HI>) which bitterne&s;s hath been accounted pro|per to <HI>Nitre,</HI> and the waters impregnated there|with,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>De Therin.</HI> l. 5. c. 5.</NOTE> of which the Laborious <HI>Ballius</HI> gives this Te&s;timony; <HI>Differunt etiam Nitro&s;ae Aquae &agrave; Sal&s;iae,

<P>Al&s;o for a further &s;atisfaction, if any Aluminous parts were contained in the Chry&s;tal &s;hoots, I ob|&s;erv'd, That the &s;ix ounces mentioned before, after they had hufft, melted and ran upon the Iron-plate, were in little more than one minute reduced to &s;omewhat le&s;s than two ounces of a dead white <HI>Calx;</HI> which being again di&s;&s;olved, filtred and e|vaporated, gave me a plain <HI>Alkali</HI> with &s;ome re|maining bitterne&s;s, which on the affu&s;ion of any acid would ferment, and being put to undergo the <HI>fire-ordeal</HI> Trial, would neither melt nor boyl, but crackle and leap.</P>
<P>To make a further Trial, whether what was bitter and &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly Nitrous might be &s;eparated from the <HI>Alkali;</HI> I di&s;&s;olved and filtred the &s;ame Salt again, and evaporating it <HI>ad Cuticulam,</HI> it &s;hot pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">tly into a white hoary down, penetrating cooling, and bitter, di&s;tinct from the <HI>Alkali</HI> with which before it was mixt, and partly into an in|&s;pi&s;&s;ated juyce, which I judge to be the <HI>&s;uccus primitivus</HI> of <HI>Nitre,</HI> with the &s;ame qualities; both which put on the Plate did huff and melt as the former, leaving a &s;mall bitter Calx behind it, which, I believe, by frequent di&s;&s;olutions, evaporations, and coagulations, would huff and melt all off, to the utter con&s;umption of its whole body that way, I mean as far as Nitrous, the <HI>Alkali</HI> &s;hewing
<PB N="23" REF="28"> it &s;elf proportionable in the Calx, after every trial.</P>
<P>And here I would not be mi&s;taken, as if I pre|tended to that grand <HI>Arcanum,</HI> the di&s;covery of the Nitre of the Ancients, for I am well a&s;&s;ured, that the de&s;cription of that is very much different from what I am now di&s;cour&s;ing of, being acknowledged by <HI>Pliny, Dio&s;corides,</HI> and others, to be of a ro&s;ie colour, and almo&s;t purple, which they u&s;ed &s;ome|times to dye that colour with (though &s;ome white there was al&s;o) and came nearer to the nature of or|dinary Salt, whereupon <HI>Dio&s;corides</HI> in his 85th. Chapter hath the&s;e words, <HI>Nitre, and the froth of Nitre</HI> (or <HI>Aphronitrum) have the &s;ame virtues as Salt, and are burn't like that;</HI> yet becau&s;e &s;ome mea&s;ures may be taken from that, for the better un|der&s;tanding of what is now under the te&s;t, I thought fit in that regard at pre&s;ent, only to make this bare mention of it.</P>
<P>Neither can the contrary, I think, be evinced from the effects; for cooling, penetrating, and purg|ing, are attributed to Nitre, and confe&s;&s;edly in the waters, the two former evident in allaying thir&s;t, abating inflammations, and quickne&s;s of pa&s;&s;age: the latter, as plain in its operation, for Nitre as well as Salt, is &s;aid both <HI>alvum laxare,</HI> and <HI>urinas ciere,</HI> and <HI>Baccius</HI> treating of nitrous waters, af|firms, that they do <HI>vacuare, virtute Nitri, per al|vum, &amp; per urinas.</HI> The like may be &s;aid of the external effects by Bathing, which can no way pre|judice the being of Nitre there.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, This way of arguing from the effects is but <HI>&agrave; po&s;teriori,</HI> and le&s;s &s;ignificant where there is matter of fact, which may be u&s;eful in the dark; but if it thwart with a plain experiment, mu&s;t yield; for, <HI>Quid verba audiam, cum videam facta?</HI> And
<PB N="24" REF="29"> whoever &s;hall undertake a bu&s;ine&s;s of this nature may con&s;ider, that the be&s;t judgment to be made of the effects, is from a con&s;tant ob&s;ervation of particu|lars on the place, which cannot be conceived to be &s;o well done at a di&s;tance, but mu&s;t require, be&s;ides &s;ome time, a good attendance, as well as practice here. But to return.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of Sulphur in the Bath water.</HEAD>
<P>AS to Sulphur, the next thing to be in&s;i&s;ted on, as contained in the Waters, I conceive that many that have endeavoured to avoid <HI>Charybdis,</HI> have fallen into <HI>Scylla,</HI> and becau&s;e the ancient Au|thors have a&s;&s;erted that Sulphur was undoubtedly concern'd in all Baths, they will affirm there is none in any; but whoever builds a fabrick on this foundation, and certainly concludes, that Sulphur is not in the Bath-waters, becau&s;e it cannot be di&s;co|ver'd by precipitation, I would have forbear a po&s;i|tive determination on a negative experiment, till I &s;ee Vitriol precipitated in &s;ub&s;tance from the King's Bath-water, which is acknowledg'd to be there. And if I cannot light on an apt precipitater, which every way oppo&s;eth the particles to be &s;o di&s;cover'd, and have &s;ome other rea&s;ons to incline me to the contrary, I &s;hould not be &s;o fond of my own con|ceit,
<PB N="27" REF="31"> as to be prevail'd upon by a comparative in|&s;tance of un&s;lak't Lime, to wipe my own No&s;e, and put out my Eyes, which as far as they can, a&s;&s;ure me to the contrary.</P>
<P>I &s;hall refer the Reader to what is mention'd be|fore concerning the Colour and Smell, in calcining the Contents of the Bath-water in general, and till I &s;hall meet with &s;omething that will both burn blew, and give a fetid &s;mell, that is not Sulphur, I &s;hall &s;o e&s;teem that, till a&s;certain'd of the con|trary.</P>
<P>I may further add, That the Sulphur is proba|bly incorporated with the Salt, as appears by its pa&s;&s;ing with it into the Lixivium, and through pa|pers in filtration, and not di&s;coverable but by a &s;trong fire, by which the body of the Salt is open'd, and a &s;olution of the Continuum made, in order to fu&s;ion; &s;o that if you do not precipitate both, you can precipitate neither, unle&s;s a &s;eparation of the Sulphur from the Salt be made, which, I pre&s;ume, is not ea&s;ie to be done, without the help of fire, by which the Sulphur is con&s;um'd: &s;o that the com|parative in&s;tance of un&s;lak't Lime is little to the pur|po&s;e; where the Sulphur is &s;eparated, decocted, and precipitated; here not &s;o, being not apart, but re&s;iding in a Saline-Sulphureous Salt, a piece of who&s;e Body, as we now have it, it &s;eems to be.</P>
<P>Moreover, Whereas he collects from the Bath-waters not ringing Silver yellow, but rather black, that there is no Sulphur contained in the &s;ame; I may retort, and that very ju&s;tly, this as an argu|ment to a&s;&s;ert it. For the proper colour that Sul|phur di&s;&s;olved gives to Silver is not &s;o much yellow as black, as may be e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ily di&s;cerned by putting any piece of Silver, but a very little while, into the de|coction
<PB N="28" REF="32"> of Sulphur made in the water of un&s;lak't Lime, which gives as near the colour of the Silver I have cau&s;ed to lye &s;ome time near the Springs of the Bath, as may be, &s;o that the difference is not di&s;cernable; not to mention that &s;ome yellowne&s;s is ob&s;erved on the Silver tinged by the Bath.</P>
<P>Neither am I fully &s;atisfied that the only, or in|deed the be&s;t, precipitator of Sulphur is an acid; for on the decoction of that Mineral in the water of quick Lime (the Lixivium, though with much Sulphur, not &s;ucceeding) and very &s;udden change, on the affu&s;ion of Spirit of Vitriol, into a milky, and much whiter Con&s;i&s;tence, the Liquor after|wards &s;ettled, and precipitated not as Sulphur, but Lime-&s;tone; &s;o that the Sulphur, although it gave a greater fetid &s;mell, yet was not &s;o apparently pre|cipitated, as by Oyl of Tartar in another gla&s;s, which gave the Sulphur in proper colour precipita|ted, without a permanent lacteous opacity. Where|upon I made this ob&s;ervation, as to the pre&s;ent ex|periment, That although acids do not precipitate of this lapideous matter alone, yet if in the embraces a &s;trong &s;ulphurous commixture, they will, and the Lime-&s;tone is mo&s;t properly precipitated by an acid, if Sulphur be decocted with it; whereas the Body of Sulphur, decocted as before, is be&s;t precipitated by a fixt Salt, the Sulphur appearing without white|ne&s;s, in its own garb, though not &s;o fetid as on the affu&s;ion of an acid.</P>
<P>It may be al&s;o noted that <HI>S. Clo&s;&s;eus,</HI> in his pre|paration of <HI>Lac Sulphuris,</HI> in which the body of Sulphur is open'd with <HI>Calx Vive,</HI> directs the Sul|phur to be precipitated with Urine.</P>
<P>The occa&s;ion of this mi&s;take (&s;eeing he pretends to give the rea&s;on of another, concerning an expe|riment of a like nature) I conceive to be, That
<PB N="29" REF="32"> the white matter precipitated on the affu&s;ion of any acid, was, without much examination, reputed wholly &s;ulphurous, as appears from the&s;e words; <HI>For if Sulphur be boyled in the water of un&s;lak't Lime, the water becomes white, not by the affu&s;ion of a fixt Salt, as before, but of an acid: &s;o that fixt Salts may di&s;&s;olve Sulphur but not precipitate it.</HI> Where|as the whitene&s;s ari&s;eth much from the mixture of the Lime-&s;tone, as appears by the open confe&s;&s;ion of what is precipitated, if &s;tanding &s;ome time, fil|ter'd, and brought to the te&s;t by fire, where the Lime-&s;tone is di&s;cover'd, the Sulphur being rather di&s;turb'd than precipitated by the acid liquor, which makes it give a greater fetor, but never kindly pre|cipitates; the other precipitation with oyl of Tar|tar, which here, contrary to its wonted cour&s;e, joyns with the Lime-&s;tone, which it u&s;ually preci|pitates, and oppo&s;eth the Sulphur, is very apparent, and &s;ulphurous beyond contradiction.</P>
<P>I am not ignorant, that in the preparation of <HI>Lac Sulphuris</HI> mentioned before, Sulphur al&s;o is precipitated by an acid, but <HI>that fixt Salts &s;hould di&s;&s;olve Sulphur, but not precipitate it,</HI> is what I &s;aid I was not &s;o fully &s;atisfied in. Not to mention that the matter precipitated by a fixt Salt is white on the fir&s;t affu&s;ion, though the whitene&s;s be not &s;o permanent, the Sulphur in a &s;hort time precipita|ting in proper colour.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, If Sulphur be boyled in the Bath-wa|ter, and doth not tinge it with a yellow colour, I pre&s;ume, it cannot thence be argu'd that there is no Brim&s;tone there, for the colour of the water in which Sulphur is di&s;&s;olved, is not &s;o much yellow as Lixiviate, or reddi&s;h; and therefore <HI>Schroder</HI> gives this direction for the making that preparation of Sulphur mentioned before, that after the Sul|phur
<PB N="30" REF="33"> and Tartar are mixed, they ought to boyl, <HI>donec fere omne Sulphur &s;olutum &s;it, liquor&abque; rubeus appareat;</HI> though &s;ome addition I confe&s;s it may have from the Tartar. Yet <HI>Clo&s;&s;eus,</HI> in his way of making that preparation where there is no Salt of Tartar, but, in&s;tead of that quick-Lime, which gives no &s;uch tincture of it &s;elf, hath this Note; <HI>Coque, donec partes tres aquae &s;int con&s;umptae, ruborem|que contraxerit in&s;tar &s;anguinis, ex Sulphure di&s;&s;o|luto.</HI></P>
<P>I therefore think it no ill advice here, that they that are &s;o much concern'd to give the rea&s;on of the mi&s;takes of others, would a little mind to rectifie their own, and not be an <HI>Argus</HI> abroad, but a Mole at home.</P>
<P>I do al&s;o acknowledg, that I believe that the white Magi&s;tery or in-palpable Powder, precipita|ted from the Bath-water on the affu&s;ion of Salt of Tartar, or any other analogous, or agreeable Salt, is not Sulphurous, much le&s;s Aluminous; but ra|ther Stony, of a lapideous &s;ub&s;tance, the re&s;ult of an intimate Commixture, with the body of the Wa|ters, which may have no &s;mall influence on their fer|mentation, as may hereafter be more fully con&s;i|der'd.</P>
<P>And as to what reflects on that famous Practitio|ner, the Ingenious and Learned Dr. <HI>Willis,</HI> I &s;hall, at pre&s;ent, &s;ay no more than this, That ob|&s;erving one &s;o pedantickly dre&s;t up in his own clothes, he ought not to be affrighted with his own &s;hape; only this may be further noted, That where|as Dr. <HI>Willis</HI> had de&s;ired of me the exacter trial of that Experiment of decocting Sulphur and An|timony in the Bath-water, I well remember I re|turn'd him &s;omething of both that was precipita|ted after a double filtration, and the decoction per|formed
<PB N="31" REF="33"> in a Ve&s;&s;el altogether free from the &s;ea&s;on of any fixt Salt.</P>
<P>Yet I mu&s;t acknowledg, that what was precipi|tated was very incon&s;iderable to what was decoct|ed, and not &s;o much as to make much alteration in the colour of the water; which may de&s;erve their con&s;ideration wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> affirm, a Lime-Chalk Stone, or <HI>Lapis calcarius,</HI> to be contained in the Waters, and yet deny them to di&s;&s;olve Sulphur, and again affirm, that Sulphur is di&s;&s;olved in the water of Lime.</P>
<P>The &s;ame alteration of the water into a turbid milky appearance, and the precipitation by oyl of Tartar, of an in&s;ipid powder, mentioned before, was al&s;o ob&s;erved in the Spaw at <HI>Scarborough,</HI> and Sulphur-Well at <HI>Knaresbrough,</HI> by <HI>William Simp&s;on</HI> Doctor in Phy&s;ick, as appears from &s;everal places in his <HI>Hydrologia Chymica,</HI> and Hydrological E&s;&s;ays, which he there a&s;&s;erts to be Aluminous, and page 118. of the latter Treati&s;e &s;aith; <HI>By the addition of Oyl of Tartar this Sulphur-water turns white, and that becau&s;e it is impregnated with a &s;mall quantity of a Simple natural Alom Salt.</HI> How far Alom is concerned in that water, I &s;hall not here di&s;pute, but leave it to the Learned Dr. <HI>Wittie,</HI> who&s;e con|cern it is: only thus much I can &s;ay, that the like <HI>Phaenomenon</HI> appearing in the&s;e waters, what is thus precipitated here is not Aluminous, as hath been acknowledged by many eminent Phy&s;itians, who have &s;een &s;ome quantity of the precipitated powder; and was particularly noted by the ever Honoured Sir <HI>Charles Scarbrough,</HI> this Summer, here.</P>
<P>But to prevent any mi&s;-under&s;tanding, I mu&s;t acknowledg that this a&s;&s;ertion &s;tands on this founda|tion, That the white powder precipitated by oyl of Tartar from the Waters, is the &s;ame with the finer
<PB N="32" REF="34"> &s;ort of what I had, in greater quantities precipita|ted &s;pontaneou&s;ly <HI>per decubitum,</HI> on the evaporati|on of many Hog&s;heads of the Water, and is now to be &s;een, though not altogether &s;o white nor fine, having undergone many alterations, which being decocted in Spring-water, the water filter'd will precipitate with oyl of Tartar, as the Bath-water doth; yet if any one &s;hall think fit to deem this Saline, and perhaps, Aluminous; he ought to con|&s;ider, how any Salt can &s;o &s;oon be deve&s;ted of the e&s;&s;ential property of what is &s;aline, as to be rendred perfectly in&s;ipid, when &s;aline at fir&s;t: though I do not ab&s;olutely deny, but that we may attribute, though &s;omewhat Catachre&s;tically, the name of Salt, to &s;omething not &s;aline, communicating with it in &s;ome other of its properties.</P>
<P>I know very well that Alom di&s;&s;olved in Spring-water, the Water filter'd and the Salt precipitated with oyl of Tartar, will be impaired much in its &s;aline ta&s;te; yet &s;o much of the &s;owrne&s;s, and &s;tip|ticity will remain, as will be &s;ufficient to di&s;cover its nature.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of Vitriol in the Bath-water.</HEAD>
<P>TO pa&s;s by the Rea&s;on of the Common Arti|fice of tinging Silver at the Bath, what con|cerns the Scum, and Sal Armoniack, as of no great moment; Vitriol is, by Him, denied to be in the Cro&s;s and Hot Bath, becau&s;e Galls beaten and in|fu&s;ed in the&s;e Waters, will never turn them purple nor black, which is confe&s;&s;ed would certainly be, if the&s;e Waters had Vitriol in them.</P>
<P>How true this is, a &s;light Experiment will &s;oon evince, and if the Author had ever made trial, his Galls or Sight, mu&s;t be wor&s;e than mine, if a pur|ple colour did not appear.</P>
<P>To which may be added the Experience and Te|&s;timony of my Honoured and Learned Friends Sir <HI>Edward Greaves,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Nat. Highmore,</HI> who have both made trial, and found the Waters turn. With the former of whom I lately further ob&s;erv'd, that when we had been &s;ufficiently &s;atisfied in the turn|ing colour of the Hot Bath Pump-water, with le&s;s than half a pint of Water and but two grains of Galls, and had thrown away the Water and Galls, in order to the trial of &s;omething el&s;e, more of the &s;ame Water, though much cooler than when brought at fir&s;t, being powred into the &s;ame gla&s;s, turn'd colour al&s;o, receiving a brisk light purple, from the remaining particles of the former infu&s;ion about the gla&s;s, though nothing of the Galls did appear at all.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="35">
<P>'Tis al&s;o confirm'd by this, That whereas the Leaves of Oak make little or no alteration in the Water of the King's Bath, the Chips, or inner Bark of the &s;ame make rather a better purple in the Water of all the Baths, than the Galls; only the King's Bath tingeth deeper than the other two, as in all Experiments of this nature, it appears to do. The like al&s;o will happen on the Seeds of Sumach contus'd and infus'd, but with Pomegranate Flow|ers mo&s;t apparently, &s;o that the Water of any of the Baths affu&s;ed hot on that, will pre&s;ently turn purple; though the colour doth not keep &s;o long in &s;trength, as that which ari&s;eth from the Oaken Chips.</P>
<P>The&s;e things con&s;ider'd, I conceive it no injury to the King's Bath to allow it a little Vitriol, though manife&s;tly derogatory to the other two to deny it, &s;ince they make their claim by the &s;ame evi|dence, and that Judg will hardly free him&s;elf from the cen&s;ure of inju&s;tice and partiality, that will not hear a poor mans Tale, but &s;uffers an hone&s;t Cau&s;e that hath weak lungs and a weaker pur&s;e to be lo&s;t, on the louder clamours of more importunate addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The truth of this Experiment being thus far call'd in que&s;tion, I am the more afraid of the cer|tainty of &s;ome others; for I remember an old Story of Mr. <HI>Thief</HI> in the Univer&s;ity, that was wont to be very bu&s;ie in &s;ome Book&s;ellers Shops, and entred in the Shop-Book under that name, whoever there|fore was taken in the fact but one time, was oblig'd to quit the whole &s;core, on this account, That he that was really convicted once, might commit the &s;ame thing five, ten, or twenty times before, and therefore he the man from whom all was re|quir'd.</P>
<PB N="35" REF="35">
<P>The Metallick Mineral, &s;o called, hath nothing Metallick contained in it; and if this be &s;o ea&s;ily, by the air, converted into Vitriol, 'tis very &s;trange we have not yet had any Hou&s;es of Vitriol, which &s;urely have endur'd the air long enough to experi|ence a Tran&s;mutation.</P>
<P>As for the Sand breaking out with the Springs in which Vitriol is &s;uppo&s;ed to lye undi&s;&s;olv'd, as was mentioned before, if there were no better ar|guments for Vitriol than this, I &s;hall not &s;tick to &s;ay, that he that depends on this, builds at be&s;t but on a &s;andy foundation.</P>
<P>That the purple colour appearing from the mix|ture of the Sand of the Bath, with the infu&s;ion of Galls, may not ari&s;e from the tincture of Vitriol, &s;eems more than probable by this Experiment. I have formerly declared, that the Sand of the Bath may be &s;o far corroded with an acid Men&s;truum, as not to ferment any longer, but lye quiet in the bot|tom of the gla&s;s without any motion at all; now, this Sand on the affu&s;ion of Common Water gave an excellent purple, when 'tis not likely that any thing &s;aline &s;hould remain, after &s;o many wa&s;hings and re|affu&s;ions, as are requi&s;ite to reduce the Sand to that condition. Moreover 'tis con&s;iderable, the infu&s;ion was not acid, nor any way alter'd from its common ta&s;t. But this Experiment I made but once, and had not an opportunity of repeating it again.</P>
<P>'Tis likewi&s;e more ob&s;ervable, That after &s;ome hours &s;tanding, a purple floccous matter did &s;ponta|neou&s;ly precipitate, upon which there being a clear &s;eparation, the Water return'd to its pri&s;tine colour, and the floccous matter &s;ub&s;ided in the bottom of the gla&s;s, which being filter'd <HI>per Chartam,</HI> and exa|min'd, was perfectly in&s;ipid, and not at all Vitrio|line.</P>
<PB N="36" REF="36">
<P>Be&s;ides, On the Calcination of half a pound of the Sand, when the Crucible was as red and the Sand as hot as u&s;ually it is when the Salts do run, the Sand powred out glowing hot, nothing &s;aline was ob&s;erv'd to concrete among it, which it would certainly do, if any fu&s;ible Salt were there, as in other Calcinations it appears to do.</P>
<P>I therefore rather judg it to proceed from an in|&s;ipid but a&s;tringent Ochre, &s;uch as is mentioned by <HI>Fallopius,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">De Met. &amp; Fo&s;&s;. c. <HI>35.</HI> de Ochra.</NOTE> which lying &s;ome time in the open air, becomes more &s;owr than when taken out of the Bath, which may occa&s;ion the difference between the Sand newly taken, and that which is kept &s;ome time; the Ochre it &s;elf infus'd making the liquor much blacker after &s;ome &s;tanding, as is more fully declared in the following Chapter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="37" REF="36">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> Containing a farther Proof and Illu&s;tration of the former particulars.</HEAD>
<P>TO make this a little clearer; 'Tis an ea&s;ie Ex|periment to powr warm water on the Sand, in what proportion you plea&s;e, which if kept &s;ome time will alter the water in which it is infus'd, into a yellowi&s;h or amber colour: when the water is impregnated very well, mix &s;ome of this with the infu&s;ion of Galls, and pre&s;ently an atropurpureous colour will appear, in which if you infu&s;e white paper but a very little while, you will quickly be &s;atisfied what colour it will tinge. Now, if this infu&s;ion be permitted to cool, the Ochre will preci|pitate, leaving the water &s;omewhat yellower than in it &s;elf it is, to which it al&s;o communicates a har&s;h ta&s;t, and at la&s;t &s;ettles on the top of the Sand, from which it may be &s;eparated by decantation. The contrary happens to the Sand newly taken, in which the Ochre clogg'd with too much moi&s;ture cannot &s;hew it &s;elf, as when older, and more dry. So that I &s;ee no rea&s;on or nece&s;&s;ity, from this <HI>Phaeno|menon,</HI> to a&s;&s;ert the exi&s;tence of Vitriol in the Sand of the Bath, otherwi&s;e than as it hath relation to this a&s;tringent Ochre, which I do believe receives this tinging property by the impre&s;&s;ion of Vitriol, this being in all probability, as is noted el&s;ewhere, the <HI>Terra Vitrioli,</HI> or Earth, in which the Vitriol is contain'd before exhalation; as I conceive, the Marl or Mud is the bed of Sulphur, or the <HI>Terra,</HI> to which that Mineral doth more nearly ad|here.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="37">
<P>And that 'tis this yellow matter that occa&s;ions the alteration, may be further evident from this; That after the fir&s;t decanting, if the Ochre be powred all off, and warm water affu&s;ed on the Sand again, and that infu&s;ion mixed with the infu|&s;ion of Galls, no change of colour will en&s;ue. To which may be added, that the Ochre it &s;elf kept &s;ome time, and infu&s;ed in the decoction of Galls, will, after lying a pretty while, turn that Liquor into a much blacker appearance.</P>
<P>I &s;hall end this di&s;pute with the ob&s;ervation of one,<NOTE PLACE="marg">D. <HI>Simp&s;on</HI></NOTE> who affirms, That Artificial Alom will not with Galls &s;trike a purple colour, but the Natural Alom with its inbred Ochre, will; a&s;cribing more to the Ochre than the Alom. So that this may be the end of that Controver&s;ie about Alom and Galls tinging Water purple, That Alom, as Alom, doth not tinge, but as in conjunction with this inbred Ochre, or as Vitrioline; for between Vitriol and Alom there are many re&s;emblances, and a worthy Author hath ob&s;erved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jord. <HI>Nat. Bath.</HI> chap. 7. p. 52.</NOTE> that the Ba&s;is of Vitriol is Alom, both the&s;e being much alike, but that Vitri|ol hath a garb from Copper or Iron, which in the Ochre gives the tinging quality, the Alom, as di|&s;tinct from Vitriol, contributing nothing at all.</P>
<P>If any &s;hall affirm this Ochre to be Vitrioline, I have not deny'd it, having formerly &s;uppo&s;ed it might be <HI>Terra Vitrioli;</HI> but what I here que&s;tion is, whether any Vitrioline &s;aline body, different from the Ochre, be contained in the Sand, or can lye undi&s;&s;olved there.</P>
<P>'Tis very remarkable what is &s;aid, That if the Sand of the Bath, impregnated with an acid Li|quor, be put into the infu&s;ion of Galls, the Liquor acquires an atropurpureous colour; and no wonder, &s;ince the acid Liquor may do much alone, as may
<PB N="39" REF="37"> be &s;een in the mixture of Vinegar, with the deco|ction or infu&s;ion of Galls, which &s;upplying in &s;ome mea&s;ure the place of Vitriol, by a kind of analogy inclines the infu&s;ion to an inky complexion.</P>
<P>And as for the Metallick Mineral contained in the Sand, which on the affu&s;ion and corro&s;ion of an acid Men&s;truum, will in part be converted into Vi|triol, I have &s;aid before that 'tis nothing el&s;e but a Common Free&s;tone, a Mineral, I confe&s;s, but how far Metallick, I leave to the judgment of the men of that Art.</P>
<P>For a partial &s;atisfaction in this thing; if the &s;harpe&s;t Vinegar be powred on the Sand in one gla&s;s, and on Free&s;tone in another, the &s;ame fermentation will appear for the pre&s;ent, and the &s;ame blewi&s;h colour of the infu&s;ion afterwards upon Corro&s;ion; &s;o that it much re&s;embles the colour and &s;mell of the &s;aturated Liquor, on the affu&s;ion of Vinegar on the filings of Iron. But whether this be a &s;uffici|ent argument to dub it Metallick, I &s;hall be better &s;atisfied, when I am convinced of this, That Truth hath never &s;uffer'd by meer Re&s;emblances.</P>
<P>But that it may appear that I de&s;ire to proceed in this Affair with all ingenuity and freedom from animo&s;ity, unle&s;s what will &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;co|ver truth; I &s;hall here recite a Pa&s;&s;age out of Dr. <HI>Wittie</HI>'s An&s;wer to <HI>Hydrologia Chymica,</HI> leaving how far it may be applicable to the &s;aline Stiria's mentioned before, to the judicious Reader and further ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>The Candid Doctor, <HI>pag.</HI> 63. among other Pre|parations out of the Minerals of the Spaw at <HI>Scar|brough,</HI> made by Mr. <HI>Sam. John&s;ton,</HI> a Phy&s;ician at <HI>Beverly,</HI> and by him communicated to the Doctor, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">kes mention of <HI>an E&s;&s;ential Salt, which Mr.</HI> John&s;ton <HI>calls</HI> Anomalous, <HI>or</HI> &s;ui generis, <HI>as differ|ing
<PB N="40" REF="38"> much from the factitious or natural kinds of Alom, Vitriol, or Nitre, though in &s;ome properties it agree with each of them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Rea&s;on of this Scruple, he adds, is this, which</HI> Paracel&s;us <HI>hath clearly made out, That here they are not corporally, but</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">I &s;uppo&s;e, the Doctor doth not mean, that what is percolated hath no body or &s;ub&s;tance, but only that 'tis more re|fin'd.</NOTE> <HI>percolated, not perfect in their &s;everal kinds, but</HI> in &s;uo primitivo, <HI>not &s;ingle, but all mixed together, which as yet I could never attain to &s;eparate. And therefore this Salt is nothing &s;o acid as Vitriol, nor &s;tiptick as Alom, nor inflammable as Nitre, notwith&s;tanding it doth &s;hoot in Stiria's. I'le only add this, That they are all here, though</HI> in fra|ctis, imminutis, &amp; debilitatis viribus, <HI>and the vir|tues of the Waters to be judged from them all.</HI></P>
<P>To which I &s;hall only &s;ubjoyn this Remarque, That the Nitre, undoubtedly here, being allay'd with the mixture of &s;ome other Salts, could not be expected to do altogether as &s;incere Nitre doth, and the be&s;t way, I conceive, to di&s;cover the di&s;tinct natures in this <HI>Compo&s;itum,</HI> had been to have at|tempted a &s;eparation by frequent Calcinations, Di&s;|&s;olutions, and Coagulations, which, if done, I much admire the &s;everal Salts did not appear in proper form, as they did in the anomalous Salt of the&s;e Waters, &s;ubjected to the &s;ame way of trial: and then I &s;omewhat que&s;tion, whether Alom would have de&s;erved &s;o much favour, as the Doctor's good nature hath allow'd it here.</P>
<P>I &s;hall forbear, at pre&s;ent, to trace this Author or follow his track any further, as al&s;o to examine his Opinion, concerning the Cau&s;e of the Heat of the Bath-waters, till my Treati&s;e, in the &s;ame lan|guage he hath written in, be pre&s;ented to the World; only thus much I &s;hall &s;ay now, That I conceive an <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> founded, though not on a &s;ubterranean <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ire, yet on things under ground, may probably
<PB N="41" REF="38" MS="y"> give more &s;atisfaction than &s;ome airy notions, con|&s;idering e&s;pecially, that nothing external to the Body of the Earth, can in rea&s;on be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of reaching the&s;e Waters, but rather &s;omewhat inclu|ded in its own Bowels, which may be near at hand, of an active, even, and durable nature; when, to &s;ay no more, nothing is more variable than the air, nor uncon&s;tant than rain.</P>
<P>I &s;hall al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;h the whole bulk of what relates to the Body of the Waters, into things Sa|line, and <HI>non</HI>-Saline: the former I &s;hall endeavour to evince to be <HI>Nitre, Common Salt,</HI> and <HI>Vitriol;</HI> the latter, to be partly unctuous, as <HI>Bitumen</HI> and <HI>Sulphur;</HI> partly gritty, as <HI>Free&s;tone;</HI> and partly earthy, as <HI>Marl</HI> and <HI>Ochre.</HI> I &s;hall likewi&s;e exa|mine what pretences Alom can make, and further di&s;cour&s;e of the difference between that and Vitri|ol: and la&s;tly, enquire into the competition of <HI>Lapis Calcarius</HI> with Free&s;tone; &s;o that the Bath-water will have relation to, or comprehend in its large&s;t extent, eight di&s;tinct Sub&s;tances, at lea&s;t ac|cording to my Ob&s;ervations, which will be the bu|&s;ine&s;s, God willing, of the fir&s;t Book of my Trea|ti&s;e <HI>De Thermis Bathonien&s;ibus,</HI> viz. <HI>de Aquarum Principiis, una cum earundem appendiculis, nimi|rum, Arena, &s;ive Sabulo, Luto, &amp; &s;upernatante uligine, &s;ive Spum&acirc;.</HI> The &s;econd Book &s;hall treat <HI>De Aquarum Calore.</HI> The third <HI>De u&s;u Thermarum; ubi de modo Balneandi; de Aquarum potatione; de Antliatione jam in u&s;u loco dulciae, aut Stillicidii Veterum; de u&s;u Luti,</HI> &amp;c.

<P>About the &s;ame time al&s;o one <HI>John Jones,</HI> an ho|ne&s;t <HI>Cambro-Britan,</HI> frequenting the Baths for Pra|ctice, compo&s;ed a little Treati&s;e of them, which he calls <HI>Baths Aid,</HI> in which are &s;ome things not con|temptible, though in a plain Countrey dre&s;s, and which might &s;atisfie and gratifie the Appetite of tho&s;e times, which fed more heartily and healthily too, on good Beef and Bag-Pudding, than we do now upon Kick&s;haws and Haut-gu&s;ts; yet no|thing of the true Nature is there di&s;covered, only, as almo&s;t in all former Writers of Baths, chiefly Ca|tholick, a &s;trong Stench of Sulphur, and a great ado about a Subterranean Fire, a fit re&s;emblance of Hell, at lea&s;t of Purgatory.</P>
<P>Our Countrey-man Dr. <HI>William Turner,</HI> I con|fe&s;s, was more particularly concern'd to give a bet|ter account, than I find is done in his Di&s;cour&s;e of Engli&s;h, German, and Italian Baths: And whether want of opportunity, or any other impediment was
<PB N="44" REF="40"> in cau&s;e, I know not; but I find that at this &s;tay they &s;tood till the Famous Dr. <HI>Jorden</HI> took Pen in Hand, about the Year 1630. To whom I thought fit to make &s;ome Additions, at my fir&s;t entrance on this Place, &s;ome five Years &s;ince. And although that Learned and Candid Phy&s;ician had <HI>chiefly and more e&s;pecially an intent to enlarge the Knowledg of our Baths in</HI> Somer&s;et-&s;hire, (as he declares to my Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> in his Dedicatory Epi&s;tle) and hath per|formed more than any Man before him, yet what was fir&s;t in Intention, was la&s;t in Execution; and how &s;mall a part of that Treati&s;e is &s;pent upon this Subject, how &s;hort he is in &s;ome Material Points, and what Objections may be framed again&s;t his Opi|nion, I may &s;ometime or other, with due Re&s;pect, more largely treat of; and for the pre&s;ent &s;hall here, with good <HI>Sem</HI> and <HI>Japhet,</HI> ca&s;t a Garment over the Nakedne&s;s of this my Father.</P>
<P>What hath been done &s;ince (except in &s;ome par|ticular pieces of other Tracts, to the Authors of which the Baths are al&s;o indebted for their kindne&s;s and good will) is not worth the mentioning. The old &s;aying's true, <HI>Little Dogs mu&s;t pi&s;s,</HI> and what is writ upon an Ale-bench claims the greater affinity to the Pipe and the Candle; e&s;pecially if the be&s;t Wine at the Fea&s;t (which is u&s;ually kept till la&s;t) be but a &s;illy Story of <HI>Tom Coriat,</HI> and an old <HI>Taun|ton</HI> Ballad new vampt, abu&s;ing the dead Gho&s;ts of <HI>Lud, Hudibras</HI> and <HI>Bladud,</HI> with a Non&s;en&s;ico-Prag|matical, Anticruzado-Orientado-Rhodomontado-Untruth-Le Grand, which we We&s;terly Moderns, call a GROTELYE, into the Bargain. A pretty Artifice in Rhetorick, to cry a thing up, and be&s;mear, and <HI>&s;hed plentifully</HI> on the Founder <HI>Ordure, both Humane and Belluine.</HI></P>

<P>I have Indu&s;triou&s;ly omitted Dr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> Dr. <HI>Venner,</HI> and &s;ome others, in regard it would be improper here to Write more Hi&s;torically. I &s;hall therefore now let you know not &s;o much what hath been done by others, as what further di&s;coveries have been made by my endeavours, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the careful Pains of Mr. <HI>Henry Moor</HI> an expert Apothe|cary and Chymi&s;t of this City.</P>
<P>And here at fir&s;t I cannot but take notice how that opinion hath &s;o much prevailed as to be ac|counted Orthodox, and not only received by Tra|dition as certain, but Printed as &s;uch, that the Body of the Waters is &s;o jejune and empty, as to afford little or nothing at all whereby to make a di&s;covery of its Nature, and that what impregnates the Baths is not Sub&s;tantially, Materially or Corporally there, but potentially, virtually and formally, or to u&s;e the Author's own words, <GAP DESC="foreign">,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Carolus Claro|mont</HI> de Aer. Aq. &amp; Loc. T. A. pag. <HI>32.</HI></NOTE> with much more canting after this manner, in a &s;mall di&s;cour&s;e in Latin written by an Itinerant Exotick; when as a &s;light operation will &s;oon evince it, though white and tran&s;parent of it &s;elf, being taken imme|diately from the Pump, to contain a con&s;iderable quantity of a Dusky, Gritty, and Saline Matter, with many tran&s;parent Particles intermixed with it, to the proportion, (as near as I can calculate) of two drams to a gallon of the Water. And this I can a&s;certain, having had &s;everal ounces of it done in Earth, Iron, Bell-metal, and Gla&s;s, and have
<PB N="46" REF="41"> at this time three or four ounces by me, untoucht, be&s;ide what I have made u&s;e of in other Experi|ments.</P>
<P>But the thing I &s;hall more Peculiarly in&s;i&s;t on, at this pre&s;ent, is, That by God's ble&s;&s;ing on my In|du&s;trious Search, I &s;uppo&s;e I have lighted on the main Con&s;tituent of the Virtues of the Bath, in which chiefly re&s;ides what benefit can be expected from the u&s;e of the&s;e Waters, and lodgeth in a Sa|line &s;ub&s;tance, in a very &s;mall proportion to the Bo|dy of the Waters; &s;o that as they are now, not much more than forty grains is contained in a Gallon, in&s;omuch that this little Soul, as I may &s;o term it, is almo&s;t lo&s;t in &s;o Gigantick a Body, and cannot animate it with that vigour and activity as may be rationally expected, were a greater quantity of the Salt contained in a le&s;s proportion of the Water. The Remainder, which is not Saline, being, as I judg, two Parts of Three of the Bulk of the con|tents, is partly Whiti&s;h, Gritty, and of a Lapide|ous Nature, concreting of it &s;elf, into a &s;tony con|&s;i&s;tence not ea&s;ily di&s;&s;olvable; partly more Light, and Dirty, re&s;embling Clay, or Marle, and di&s;co|vers it &s;elf by an apparent &s;eparation from the Sa|line and Gritty part mentioned before.</P>
<P>Now the chief Virtue of the Bath, as I conceive, con&s;i&s;ting in the Salts, which appear by undeniable Experiments, to be Nitrous, and I believe Vitrio|line (Bitumen and Sulphur being not Primarily, as the&s;e Salts, but Secondarily concern'd) and no &s;mall proportion of other things blended with it, the be&s;t way to make it mo&s;t &s;erviceable I conceived to be, to free it from tho&s;e incumbrances and al|lays it hath from the other Ingredients, and prepare it as exactly as may be performed by Art, for the benefit of tho&s;e e&s;pecially who are willing to Drink
<PB N="47" REF="41"> the Waters with greater &s;ucce&s;s in a le&s;&s;er quantity; which they may now do, and have more of the virtue of the Waters in a quart, three pints, or a pottle, than they formerly had in two or three Gallons, did they drink &s;o much; which will be, be&s;ides other Conveniencies, a great relief to the Stomach, which certainly mu&s;t be relaxed, and the Tone of it injured by that va&s;t quantity of Water which is u&s;ually taken, diluting its ferment over|much, and di&s;tending its Membranes beyond all the bounds of a rea&s;onable Capacity.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, What is &s;eparated only by an artificial Extraction will better unite again, and mix with the Waters, as much more familiar, than the ex|traneous Salts of <HI>Sal Prunella,</HI> Cream of Tartar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which are u&s;ually di&s;&s;olved and drunk with the Waters; &s;o that a great part of the Operation may be a&s;cribed to that; and the Waters being, as we &s;ay, between two Stools, that of it &s;elf, and the di&s;&s;olvent in it, hath not attained to that degree of Reputation as they have de&s;erved, and may be pro|cured with much more advantage, if nothing but the &s;ame be &s;pent upon the &s;ame, a way of Improve|ment altogether equally beneficial to Fluids and So|lids, to the wet as to the dry.</P>
<P>Again, Whereas it is a cu&s;tom here as in all other places of the like Nature, when Per&s;ons are not willing, or have not conveniences to come to the Fountain Head, to &s;end for the Waters to the pla|ces of their Re&s;idence, not thinking it much material whether <HI>Mahomet</HI> go to the Mountain, or the Moun|tain come to him, whereby the Virtue of the Wa|ters is much impaired, if not &s;topped and &s;ealed up with very great care; this defect may in good part be &s;upplyed by the addition of a Quantity of the &s;ame Ingredients, which may repair the lo&s;s that
<PB N="48" REF="42"> hath been &s;u&s;tained by Evaporation in the Carri|age, or other way of damage, and re&s;tore it again, as near as may be, to its pri&s;tine Virtue, and genuine advantage. Not to mention, that if need require, and the poorer &s;ort cannot procure or pay the Fraight for the Waters, they may take a &s;hort|er cour&s;e, by mixing the Salt, which they may have at rea&s;onable Rates, with Spring-Water, brought to a proportionable degree of heat at home, and expect more advantage, for ought I know, than tho&s;e that drink the Waters them&s;elves at &s;o great a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e I am now fallen on this Subject, I &s;hall crave leave to remind you of what you well enough under&s;tand already, that not only <HI>Dulcius</HI> but <HI>&V;tilius ex ip&s;o Fonte, &amp;c.</HI> and Waters e&s;pecially impregnated with volatile Spirits, &s;uch as mo&s;t acid are, and peculiarly Vitrioline, to avoid the incon|venience and expence, not &s;o much of Money as Virtue, in the Carriage, mu&s;t be drank on the place where they are, which, in &s;ome kind re&s;embling Children, that mu&s;t live by &s;ucking, if once remov|ed from their Mother, or Nur&s;e, by degrees dwin|dle away, and at la&s;t die.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable in the&s;e Waters, that with four Grains of Galls injected into a Pint Gla&s;s of Water, or the Water poured on it, it immediately turns of a purple Colour, which in &s;hort time after, as the Water cools, abates much of its vividity, and be|comes more faint: if the Waters be &s;uffered to cool, and be quite cold before the Galls are injected, but little alteration happens upon a much greater proportion of Galls &s;uperadded, and (what is more remarkable) if the Water, which is permitted to cool, be recruited by the Fire, and the &s;ame Tryal reiterated, it offers no greater &s;atisfaction in change
<PB N="49" REF="42"> of Colour, than the &s;econd Experiment. Con&s;onant to what <HI>Andreas Baccius</HI> hath formerly ob&s;erv'd, who in his &s;econd Book <HI>de Thermis, Cap.</HI> 10. <HI>Pag.</HI> 69. hath the&s;e words, <HI>Nulla Balnei Aqua, eodem cum &s;ucce&s;&s;u ac laude bibitur longe exportata, quo ad fontem proprium; maxima enim parte ex ip&s;o fonte hau&s;tae ac delatae, amittunt omnem virtutem; multae non &s;ervantur per hyemem, dilutae pluviis; &amp; quae ut|cunque &s;ervantur delatae &agrave; propriis fonticulis, fieri non pote&s;t, quin amittant, cum calore &s;uo Minerali, vivificos illos Spiritus in quibus omnis Juvamenti vis con&s;i&s;tit, quae &s;emel ami&s;&s;a, nullo po&s;tea extrin&s;eco calore re&s;tituitur. Quod e&s;t valde notandum.</HI></P>
<P>I have been the more particular in this, in regard it is a very u&s;eful and practical Di&s;covery, and may procure more real advantage to Mankind, than the vain and unattainable attempts of the Philo&s;ophers Stone, making Gla&s;s malleable, and the Quadrature of a Circle.</P>
<P>Some other Ob&s;ervations I &s;hall al&s;o mention, of a le&s;s magnitude, and more contracted circum|ference, as the dying of the Bath-guides skins, the Bathers Linnen, and the Stones in the bottom of the Bath, of a yellow colour, and the eating out of the Iron Rings of the Bath, the Iron Bars of the Windows about the Bath, and any Iron infu&s;ed in it; in&s;omuch as I have now by me a Gad of Iron by accident taken up among the Stones of the Kings-Bath, &s;o much eaten out, and dige&s;ted by the O&s;trich &s;tomach of the&s;e Waters, that, the &s;weetne&s;s extracted, what remains re&s;embles very much a Hony-comb, a deep perforation in many places be|ing attempted, and the whole Gad it &s;elf reduced to a thing very much like a Sponge.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> the Tincture I have di&s;covered to ari&s;e from an Ochre, with which the Bath abounds,
<PB N="50" REF="43"> and hath afforded me a con&s;iderable quantity, &s;o that now I have near a pound by me, and with an infu&s;ion of that in warm water, tinge Stones as exactly of the Bath colour, that they are not di&s;cern|able one from another. It is further ob&s;ervable, that the nearer the place of ebullition, where the Springs ari&s;e, the deeper and finer is the Yellow colour, &s;o that in &s;ome places, about the Cro&s;s in the Kings Bath, and at the head of the great Spring, at the Southwe&s;t corner thereof, it is almo&s;t made a natu|ral paint, being laboured together by the working of the Springs, and a continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new Matter coming on, free from tho&s;e impurities it contracts in other places, which make it di&s;tingui&s;h|able into two or three &s;orts, according to its mix|tures with, or freedom from, more adulterating Matter. The Clouts al&s;o and Woollen Rags, which the Guides u&s;e to &s;top the Gouts withal, be&s;ides the Walls, Slip-doors and Po&s;ts, when the Bath is kept in a con&s;iderable time, as in the Winter &s;ea&s;on it u&s;eth to be, are all very much tinged with this yel|low &s;ub&s;tance, and if at any time they chance to lie unwa&s;h'd or not thrown away, they &s;end out &s;o ungrateful a &s;cent, that a man had rather &s;mell to a Carnation, Ro&s;e, Violet, or a Pomander, than be within the wind of &s;o unwelcom a &s;mell, it being the greate&s;t policy to get the Weather-gage in this encounter. The &s;ame thing I have experienced in Ve&s;&s;els at home, where after it had &s;tood &s;ome time in a common infu&s;ion of warm water, I have the &s;ame reverence for that as Pictures, and do aver it to be true, <HI>E Longinquo reverentia major.</HI></P>
<P>One thing more is to be noted before I leave this particular, that although &s;o much of this yel|low Matter is continually bred, with which the neighbouring Ground is &s;ufficiently repleni&s;ht, as I
<PB N="51" REF="43"> have found by digging in &s;ome places not far di&s;tant, yet nothing of that colour is di&s;covered in the Con|tents, a probable argument it either evaporates, to which I am more inclin'd, in regard I find it much more copious where the Steam of the Bath meets with any re&s;i&s;tence, or el&s;e it may be, which is le&s;s probable, turns colour by the fire in evaporation that way; le&s;s probable, I &s;ay, becau&s;e for further &s;atisfaction, I have decocted the Ochre more than once, and find rather that it gets than lo&s;es in its colour.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;on of this I conceive to be, That this Ochre being probably, as I have el&s;ewhere di&s;|cour&s;t, the vehicle of Vitriol, on its &s;eparation from it in the open air, precipitates to the bottom, and tinges the &s;tones with a yellow colour, leaving the body of the waters through which it pa&s;&s;es much unconcern'd; which may be one rea&s;on, why the Water of the open Bath tingeth not with Galls, as I have ob&s;erv'd, like that from the Pumps, though the avolation of Spirits may not perhaps be alto|gether ridiculous, con&s;idering e&s;pecially, that the water from the Pump when cold, will lo&s;e its ting|ing property, though nothing be ob&s;erv'd to be precipitated. And that &s;ome of this yellow matter is contained in the water, though with &s;ome difficulty ob&s;erved, doth appear from the fifty &s;econd Ob&s;er|vation.</P>
<P>The greeni&s;h colour ari&s;eth from another cau&s;e, which I conceive may be the effect either of the Salt or Vitriol, or both, the former making that colour in meats long in &s;alt, and the latter, if from green Copperas, may ea&s;ily be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The eating out of the Iron I conceive mu&s;t proceed from &s;omething Corro&s;ive, and till any one can a&s;&s;ure me 'tis &s;omething el&s;e, I &s;hall judge
<PB N="52" REF="44"> it to be Vitriol, though the Salt al&s;o may contribute not a little. And that it may appear not to be cau|&s;ed by the bare &s;team, as Ru&s;t is bred upon Pot|hooks and Cotterels, be&s;ides the difficulty to con|ceive how the &s;team &s;hould operate under water, as in the ca&s;e of the Gad before mentioned, I made a Lixivium of the contents of the Water, and in it infu&s;ed Iron but a very &s;mall time, and found it to do the &s;ame as in the Bath it &s;elf, con&s;idering the time of infu&s;ion; and the very Knives and Spatules I put in to &s;tir &s;ome re&s;idence in the bottom, were almo&s;t as &s;oon as dry, cru&s;ted over and defended with a ru&s;ty coat.</P>
<P>I have other Arguments I &s;uppo&s;e will contri|bute &s;omething more to the confirmation of this opinion; as that with the help of the Sand of the Bath, with Water and Galls, I made good writing Ink, which in a &s;hort time comes to be very legible; but the infu&s;ion of the Contents in Common wa|ter, or the Lixivium thereof, with an addition of an incon&s;iderable proportion of the decoction of Galls makes it tolerably legible on the fir&s;t com|mixture, only the fir&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> that made with Sand, ca&s;ting an eye of decayed red from a mixture of Ochre contained in the &s;ame. Neither is it altoge|ther to be &s;lighted, that the Water it &s;elf hath been heretofore u&s;ed by the be&s;t writing Ma&s;ters for the making of Ink, who ob&s;erving by their experience, that Ink made with Bath-water, and the other u|&s;ual Ingredients, had a better colour, and was more la&s;ting than any other, preferred this Water before any other for this u&s;e, as I have been informed by &s;ome credible per&s;ons. Al&s;o having not long &s;ince occa&s;ion to pour warm water on the Contents of the Bath, in order to the making a Lixivium, &s;ome of the water happened by an accident to fall on a
<PB N="53" REF="44"> Bazil skin I &s;ometimes u&s;e, and immediately turn|ed the Red into a Black more than the breadth of an ordinary hand, with as much facility as any Curriers Liquor. Alum I know will do the like, but I find no nece&s;&s;ity to a&s;&s;ert that, which had it any thing to do here, mu&s;t make the Water much rougher, whiter and &s;owrer, than I find it to be. To which I may add, that many judicious per&s;ons, my Patients, and &s;ome intelligent and eminent Phy|&s;icians al&s;o have a&s;&s;ured me, that they have perfect|ly di&s;cerned by the ta&s;te a mixture of Vitriol, and that I need not doubt, but that was one principal Ingredient. 'Tis al&s;o not very incon&s;iderable, that the Bath-water alone will coagulate Milk, though not after the u&s;ual way of making a Po&s;&s;et; for after the Milk and Water are put together, it mu&s;t boil pretty &s;martly, el&s;e the Curd will not ri&s;e. I may likewi&s;e &s;ubjoyn as a further probability, that on the relenting of the Salt extracted into an Oyl <HI>per deliquium,</HI> there is a very &s;harp Stiptick and Vitrioline ta&s;te perceived in the gro&s;s <HI>deliquium,</HI> as al&s;o in the clear Oyl, and the Salt it &s;elf; not to mention its &s;hooting into glebes, of which I have &s;ome &s;mall a&s;&s;urances by trials I have made, not yet &s;ufficiently &s;atisfactory, and therefore I di&s;|mi&s;s this part for the pre&s;ent, with the greate&s;t pro|bability, till a further inquiry &s;hall make me po|&s;itive.</P>
<P>But as to Nitre, there can be no que&s;tion made about that I &s;uppo&s;e; for be&s;ides the quick, acri|monious, cooling, and nau&s;eous ta&s;te, mo&s;t apparent|ly di&s;coverable both in the infu&s;ed contents, the Salt and Oyl (the latter of which, <HI>viz.</HI> the nau&s;eous Ta&s;te, I take more particular notice o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">, in regard it is mo&s;t predominant, and a&s;&s;igned by <HI>Fallopius</HI> to Nitre, and the Waters impregnated with it, which,

<P>I the rather mention this, in regard it hath been my good hap to bring this thing to perfection and autoptical Demon&s;tration, which hath been in vain attempted by &s;ome indu&s;trious per&s;ons; not that I am, in the lea&s;t, willing to arrogate to my &s;elf, or derogate from them, more than what is fitting, but to confirm this truth, that there are &s;ome <HI>Mollia tempora fandi;</HI> &s;ome opportunities, when Nature will give willing audience, without much ceremo|ny or ado, confe&s;&s;ing more by fair per&s;wa&s;ions, than racks and torments, and greater importunity. And that we ought to be very cautious how we affirm a thing not to be, upon the failure of a &s;ingle, or &s;ome repeated Experiments.</P>
<P>In fine, Le&s;t I &s;hould too much exceed the bounds of a Letter, what concerns the cau&s;e of the Heat of the Waters, I &s;ay little of here, only tell you, that when I &s;hall come to di&s;cour&s;e of that Subject, of which I intend, God willing, a large Di&s;qui&s;ition in another Language, I believe I &s;hall find my &s;elf obliged not &s;o much to depend on a &s;ubterranean Fire, as to expect greater &s;ati&s;|faction from another Hypothe&s;is.</P>

<P>BUT the greate&s;t Argument of Antiquity the Place affords, I &s;uppo&s;e to be the <HI>Roman</HI> Coins found in or near it, with the In&s;criptions and Ima|ges in the Town or Borough Walls, the latter of which, to wit, the In&s;criptions and Images, Mr. <HI>Cambden</HI> took notice of, and in&s;erted into his <HI>Bri|tannia.</HI></P>
<P>To begin with the <HI>Roman</HI> Coins: The fir&s;t I &s;hall mention is that of <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> made 1600 years &s;ince, this Emperour's Reign beginning <HI>A.

<P>The In&s;criptions and Images next &s;ucceed; and the fir&s;t I take notice of is the neare&s;t to the North-gate, being a Memorial of a <HI>Roman</HI> Senator, of the Colony of <HI>Gloce&s;ter,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cambd. <HI>Br. p.</HI> 3<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">0.</NOTE> a City built by the <HI>Romans,</HI> who al&s;o placed there a Colony called <HI>Colonia Gle|vum.</HI> The In&s;cription thus:</P>

<P>Next to that lower, toward the We&s;t-gate, is the Monument of one of the Children of two <HI>Romans, Primulus, Romulus, Vipomulus,</HI> or rather <HI>Vete|romulus</HI> (for that word in the &s;tone is &s;omewhat difficult to be read) and <HI>Victi&s;arina,</HI> with a longer and exactly <HI>Roman</HI> In&s;cription, in a &s;epulchre Ta|ble,

<P>In the out&s;ide of the Wall, pretty high, is a Head, which &s;eems of no great moment. <HI>Fig.</HI> 9. And as for <HI>Hercules</HI> &s;training two Snakes, I cannot yet be &s;o fortunate as to light upon it. <HI>Fig.</HI> 14.</P>
<P>Between the We&s;t and South-gates &s;tand the&s;e Letters cro&s;s, which, by rea&s;on the &s;tone is cut on both &s;ides, are unaccountable:

<P>Near this place formerly was a Hare running (now lo&s;t) which might be the <HI>Rebus</HI> of a <HI>Lepori|us</HI> that &s;et up this Monument. There were of that name in <HI>Britain,</HI> and it is now the name of the Ho|nourable Family of my Lord of <HI>Colerain. Fig.</HI> 15.</P>

<P>For a fuller confirmation of the precedent parti|culars, I think fit to in&s;ert in this place an extract out of an ancient Record, now in the hou&s;e of my Honoured friend <HI>Edward Co&s;in</HI> E&s;quire, who&s;e genius inclining him to the &s;tudy of Antiquity, hath collected, and communicated it to me.</P>

Hence grew a jar between the Monks of <HI>Bathe</HI> and Canons of <HI>Wells,</HI> about the Election of the Bi&s;hop. At la&s;t the difference was compo&s;ed by that Bi&s;hop <HI>Robert</HI> whom before I &s;pake of: <HI>That</HI> from thence forward the Bi&s;hop &s;hould be nominated from both places, and that precedency in the &s;tyle &s;hould be given to <HI>Bathe.

To his Ma&s;ter, becau&s;e the <HI>Olive</HI> being the Emblem or Hieroglyphick of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Plenty</HI> &s;eemed to him to allude to King <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh, who was worthily counted the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t peaceable King in all Europe of that age. To him&s;elf (for the wi&s;e&s;t will flatter them&s;elves &s;ometimes) be|cau&s;e he was not only a chief Coun&s;ellour to this King, and had been his Amba&s;&s;adour to conclude a mo&s;t Honourable Peace with <HI>Charles</HI> the Eighth, who paid, as <HI>Holin&s;head</HI> writeth, 745 Duckets, be|&s;ides a yearly Tribute of 25000 Crowns, but al&s;o he carried both the <HI>Olive</HI> and <HI>King</HI> in his Name; and therefore thought he was &s;pecially de&s;igned for
<PB N="93" REF="65"> this Church-work, to the advancement of which, he had an extraordinary inclination.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XII.</HI> Of the Baths of <HI>Bathe.</HI></HEAD>
<P>COncerning the Nature, U&s;e and Virtues of the Baths, I purpo&s;e, if God permit, to write a large and particular Account, in a Ju&s;t Treati&s;e on that Subject, con&s;onant to my own Principles, which for the greater Credit of this Nation and Place (nothing having ever been before attempted in this kind) &s;hall be in the general Language; the de&s;ign of which I have expre&s;&s;ed <HI>Chap.</HI> 7. For I well remember what I writ in my Appendix, &s;even years ago, in the&s;e words: <HI>I come now to &s;peak &s;ome|thing of the Nature, &V;&s;e and Virtues of the Baths. And here it cannot be expected I &s;hould &s;ay much, be|cau&s;e my Experience of them as yet hath been but lit|tle, and the Ob&s;ervations I have made &s;eem fitter, as they are intended, for a foundation to a greater Work, which Time and Variety of Experiments mu&s;t compleat, than at pre&s;ent to be Communicated to the Publick. And to make &s;ome compen&s;ation for my Brevity in this
<PB N="95" REF="66"> Thing, which is ju&s;tly deemed the mo&s;t material of all other, I &s;hall take the boldne&s;s to engage, as &s;oon as Time and Opportunity &s;hall permit, to make a through &s;earch into the Cau&s;e of the Heat, Nature, and Effi|cacious Operations of the Baths, and perhaps give a more &s;atisfactory Account of the former, than hath yet been given by any; and for the latter, I &s;hall not build on the Hay and Stubble of the Talk and Rela|tions of per&s;ons bya&s;t and concern'd, but on the &s;olid ba&s;is of Rea&s;on, Ob&s;ervation, and Experience.</HI> And again, the la&s;t words: <HI>But I hope I may be excu&s;ed on the &s;core of my former Engagement, if I am not more particular at this time in things of this nature, till a ju&s;t ama&s;sment of Ob&s;ervations and Experiments, and a rational deduction of Conclu&s;ions from them, which I hope in &s;ome time to accompli&s;h, &s;hall either confirm me in the opinion I now have of the Nature and Virtues of the Baths of</HI> Bathe, <HI>or &s;upply me with a better.</HI></P>
<P>Having, I &s;ay, intended a Piece of this nature, and al&s;o publi&s;hed many Particulars relating to this Affair, in the en&s;uing Century of Ob&s;ervations, which I now make publick, as a Specimen of my way of procedure, and ground-work or foundation of my next Super&s;tructure, I &s;hall content my &s;elf at pre&s;ent with &s;ome few Remarks.</P>
<P>The Baths then in &s;ome Things do agree; in others are different.</P>
<P>They agree in this, That though chiefly three in number, the King's, Cro&s;s, and Hot (the Queen's being but an Appendent to the King's, as the Le|per's to the Hot) yet they all participate of the &s;ame Minerals, only the Hot Bath, if &s;ome of my Ob&s;ervations hold, hath &s;omething more than the King's, or Cro&s;s, both which as to the particulars, and particular proportions, in a Hog&s;head, Gallon,
<PB N="96" REF="67"> and Pint, are much the &s;ame, and what is defe|ctive in one Ingredient in one Bath, is made up by another, in the other. So that herein the wonder|ful Contrivance of the Almighty hath appeared, in making &s;o fine a Compo&s;ition of &s;uch various In|gredients, and acted (with Reverence be it &s;poken) not only the Phy&s;ician, but the Apothecary too, a good example and precedent for his Creatures to follow, who have liv'd to &s;ee that unhappy day, wherein a blear-ey'd <HI>Leah</HI> hath been advanc'd, though with &s;hame and de&s;truction too, above a legitimate <HI>Rachel.</HI></P>
<P>They differ chiefly in Dimen&s;ion, and degree of Heat.</P>
<P>In Dimen&s;ion; The King's Bath being 57 foot, or 19 yards, 10 inches, long; 40 foot, 8 inches, or 13 yards &frac12; and 2 inches in breadth.</P>
<P>The Queen's, 8 yards, or 24 foot, 2 inches, in breadth; in length 25 foot, 4 inches; or 8 yards, 16 inches.</P>
<P>The Cro&s;s Bath, 24 foot; or 8 yards, 6 inches long; 19 foot 11 inches, or 6 yards &frac12; and 5 inches over Northward; 12 foot, or 4 yards, 7 inches over on the South.</P>
<P>The Hot Bath, 10 yards 8 inches &frac12; long; 4 yards 13 inches &frac12; broad South; 4 yards &frac12; and 5 inches over North.</P>
<P>From this undeniably is deduc'd that they differ in the Water they contain; for being of different dimen&s;ions, the greater mu&s;t hold more, and the le&s;&s;er le&s;s. To pur&s;ue this Curio&s;ity a little further, I find by Gage, The King's Bath being 1 yard 18 inches in Water, to contain three hundred and fourteen Tun, thirty &s;ix Gallons.</P>
<P>The Queen's, eighty one Tun, three Hog&s;heads, and eleven Gallons.</P>
<PB N="97" REF="67">
<P>The Cro&s;s, fifty three Tun, and forty &s;even Gallons.</P>
<P>The Hot, fifty four Tun, and twenty &s;even Gallons.</P>
<P>As to the difference ari&s;ing from the degree of Heat, though I mu&s;t acknowledg my defect of Ob|&s;ervations in that kind, which I will hereafter &s;up|ply, yet I may &s;ay thus much now, That the King's and Hot Baths are not more different in that parti|cular than the Queen's, and Cro&s;s, and that this latter is the mo&s;t temperate of all.</P>
<P>And here it may be noted, That what is written concerning the difference in degree of Heat in the Baths, is &s;o to be under&s;tood as e&s;teemed now; for the Hot Bath was formerly accounted the Hotte&s;t of all, whence it had its name, <GAP DESC="foreign">, the re&s;t being ever, and &s;o reputed Hot, though in &s;ome degrees inferior to that. Hence <HI>Jones</HI> &s;ays, From what he there deliver'd, the rea&s;on may be gather'd why &s;ome of the Waters of Baths break out mo&s;t Hot, as the Hot Bath at <HI>Bathe;</HI> others meanly Hot, as the Cro&s;s Bath; others between both, as the King's Bath. And in another place; The King's Bath is Hot between both the other. But of this I intend, God willing, to make further Try|als.</P>
<P>The Cau&s;e of this Variation I conceive to be not an Intention, and Remi&s;&s;ion of a Subterranean Fire, (which meeting with an Enemy that hath had &s;o many recruits and reinforcements as the Water hath, and will have till the end of all Things, 'tis much &s;hould yet keep its ground, and not be extinct, to mention no other Ab&s;urdities at pre&s;ent, that unde|niably follow on that <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> this Variation, I conceive, doth not ari&s;e on that &s;core) but rather is cau&s;ed by a greater or le&s;&s;er fermentation, ari&s;ing
<PB N="98" REF="68"> from the Acting of an Acid on an Alcalizate Salt, both which are contained in the Bath, and much a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by the va&s;t Quantity of an impalpable Pow|der, the greate&s;t Ingredient in the Waters, and &s;eems to &s;erve for no other end, except, what &s;hall be hereafter mentioned, to admini&s;ter a perpetual &s;upply to the Fermentation.</P>
<P>'Tis likewi&s;e ob&s;ervable, That where the greate&s;t Heat is, as in the King's, and Hot Bath, there is the greate&s;t Quantity of this fermentative matter, in&s;omuch as I have Calculated that near 50 pound weight goes off in little more than 24 hours in the King's; but in the Cro&s;s Bath, where le&s;s need is, there is le&s;s of this gritty matter, and much le&s;s goes off in a longer time. So that having &s;ometime re&s;embled this Fermentation to Generation, the fa|ther of it being an acid &s;aline Spirit, and the mo|ther this gritty matter and Alcalizate Salt, the Conjunction made, and the Thing produc'd, the father &s;lips away invi&s;ibly in a Mi&s;t of Steam, and the mother pa&s;&s;es out at a back-door as &s;oon as may be, re&s;igning the Work to be &s;ucce&s;&s;ively promoted in the &s;ame manner, to future generations. And indeed &s;hould the matter &s;till continue that hath done its work, the Springs and Channels would be quickly ob&s;tructed, &s;o that what is acid being of light burden, and more active, quickly exhales, and the more Corpulent pa&s;&s;eth off by convenient Sluces and Draughts, as an Excrement, upon which the Wheel of Fermentation is kept continually going, by an immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new matter of the &s;ame kind. That not only the acid part, but the more fixt Salts al&s;o do in part exhale, may be found confirmed by the 88th. Ob&s;ervation, which cannot but part with &s;omething of their Sub&s;tance in the <HI>Lucta</HI> of Fermentation.</P>
<PB N="99" REF="68">
<P>Again, In &s;ome places where the fermentation is le&s;s, as in the Water of St. <HI>Vincents Rock</HI> near <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> which hath not half the heat that the Cro&s;s-Bath hath, the Water abates near the proportion in the quantity of Ingredients; and although for the mo&s;t part the &s;ame, yet in &s;o &s;mall a proportion, cannot act as a greater quantity would do, and the acidity being &s;o little as &s;carce to coagulate Milk, or turn with Galls, may not be expected to do wonders in a fermentation.</P>
<P>To conceive a continuation of the Hot waters of <HI>Bathe</HI> to that of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> by way of Drein, as &s;ome Ingenious per&s;ons have imagin'd, is unphilo|&s;ophical. For if very Salt water becomes in&s;ipid by running but the tenth part of that cour&s;e under ground, how can it rationally be expected that any Salt &s;hould be left of that little in the Bath here, after &s;uch a tedious journey, in which it may hap|pily meet with many fre&s;h Subterranean pa&s;&s;engers in cro&s;s roads, that may intrude upon it, and, by mixing with it rob it long before both of its Salt|ne&s;s and Heat.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t therefore &s;ay here, what I &s;hall further di&s;cour&s;e of more at large in another place, That &s;ince my fir&s;t con&s;ideration of this matter, I was ever inclin'd to believe, that the cau&s;e of the Heat and impregnation of the Baths was not far off from the Baths them&s;elves, <HI>(Coram ade&s;t quod quaerimus)</HI> for to me it &s;eems not a little &s;trange, that on dig|ging &s;o many Wells, Stone-quarries, Cole-pits, and other penetrations of the Earth to a con&s;iderable depth, that have been made about the City, no Hot water &s;hould appear, but only in one Stone-quarry near <HI>Dunkerton</HI> about an hundred years ago,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Bathes Aid,</HI> lib. 2. fol. 20.</NOTE> mentioned by <HI>Jones</HI> to have been &s;o hot, that they were fain to forbear working: The truth of which
<PB N="100" REF="69"> Relation I &s;omewhat que&s;tion, and rather believe the hone&s;t <HI>Cambrobritan,</HI> being a Stranger here, might the ea&s;ier be impo&s;ed on by &s;ome fabulous Relator.</P>
<P>Another Argument for a different Fermentation I take to be the different forms of &s;hooting of the Nitrous &s;tiria's; otherwi&s;e, why &s;hould the Kings and Hot-Bath, that have the &s;tronge&s;t heat, &s;hoot into more compact needles, and much thicker than the Cro&s;s? but that the &s;tronger fermentation ripens, and invigorates better the Crude matter of the &s;hoots, when the other not &s;o &s;trong leaves the matter crude and weak.</P>
<P>Before I give a rough Draught of my own Hy|pothe&s;is, which I only here propo&s;e, and &s;hall further, God willing, illu&s;trate and poli&s;h in my next undertaking, I mu&s;t premi&s;e the&s;e few parti|culars, which in part contain a Survey of this Country.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That the ground on which the City of <HI>Bathe</HI> in good part &s;tands, e&s;pecially near the Baths, is rai&s;ed ground, and that probably, under &s;ome yards of Gravel is a Bog, made by the confluence of Waters hither. This &s;eems in good mea&s;ure e|vident from this, That on the digging &s;ome foun|dations not long &s;ince, the Workmen came at la&s;t to a &s;oft Mud, which yielding much, and a Soul|diers Pike of a good length thru&s;t into it, no bot|tom was di&s;covered, but a warm, Marly, Sulphurous mud adhering to the Pike. This was ob&s;erv'd in the North and South-we&s;t parts of the Town.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the Springs of Cold water a|bout this place are very numerous, in&s;omuch that &s;ometime &s;ince, having been de&s;ired by that Inge|nious and Learned Knight Sr. <HI>Anthony Morgan,</HI> &s;ince
<PB N="101" REF="69"> dead in <HI>France,</HI> to &s;earch what Springs I could find hereabouts, in order to the making &s;everal mixtures, if that way we might give any light to a Fermentation; I remember I brought Water from twenty two &s;everal Springs, and might have done from as many more, within two miles com|pa&s;s, on one &s;ide.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That the two Water-hou&s;es &s;upplying the City, are placed on two Hills, one on the North, and another on the South, for the more convenient &s;upply of the whole with Water.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That the Bowels of the Earth on the South of the Town, with the South-ea&s;t and South-we&s;t parts, for four or five miles compa&s;s, are &s;ufficiently repleni&s;ht with great plenty of Free|&s;tone, which &s;upplies the Country round about with good Materials for building, and would do many Counties more were there a way agreed upon for its better conveyance.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That on the North part of the Town little or none of this Free&s;tone is digged, but Wa|ter ari&s;es in abundance, and on the Hills about <HI>Mar&s;hfield</HI> &s;ome Marca&s;ites have been found, of which Vitriol is made, and probably more of that kind are contained in that ground. I mean not the white Marca&s;ite found on <HI>Lan&s;down:</HI> what that was is notoriou&s;ly known.</P>
<P>Sixthly, That another &s;ort of Earth that abounds about <HI>Bathe,</HI> is blew Marle and Ochre. This is di&s;covered almo&s;t in all &s;ides of deep hollow ways, the River &s;ides, and particularly at <HI>Lambridge,</HI> a mile off, is a blew Marly &s;late with Ochre &s;ticking to it, and under that clear Ochre alone. And</P>
<P>Seventhly, That almo&s;t all things about the Bath, as Marle, Ochre, Free&s;tone, Sand, Mud, Scum, Shells and Salts, will ferment on the affu&s;ion of any acid.</P>

<P>The&s;e things premi&s;ed, I proceed to my Con|jecture concerning the Ri&s;e, Continuation and Heat of the Baths; and man can do no more; for <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>the be&s;t Prophe&s;ie is but a good Gue&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I conceive then, that the Salts and Marle with the conflux of Waters into this compa&s;s of lower ground, being created in the beginning, and then placed under or near where the Baths now &s;tand, by the virtue of tho&s;e words, <GAP DESC="foreign">, <HI>increa&s;e</HI> and <HI>multiply,</HI> have increa&s;ed ever &s;ince from their own &s;eeds, in their proper Seminaries, as the great|e&s;t part of the Creation doth and ever will, till the con&s;ummation of all things. Neither do I &s;ee much more rea&s;on to admire the breeding and in|crea&s;e of tho&s;e Minerals under ground, than the perpetual &s;pringing and inexhau&s;tible growth of the little &s;pires of Gra&s;s we tread on above it: But it ever was and will be the humor of the gene|rality of Mankind to overlook what's before them, and pay their admiration to what they do not &s;ee, it faring with many other things as with Vertue in the Poet:
<Q><L>&mdash; <HI>Prae&s;entem odimus</HI></L>
<L><HI>Sublatam ex oculis quaerimus invidi.</HI></L>
<L>Vertue remov'd we dote on; pre&s;ent &s;light:</L>
<L>And darkne&s;s thus prefer before the light.</L></Q> The Salts being here &s;ufficiently fixt, two large Currents of Water may come down upon them, and meet very near or under the Baths them&s;elves; the one from the South, bringing with it its <HI>Cargo</HI> of Free&s;tone, the commodity, as was &s;aid of that part of the Country; the other from the North, acuated by &s;ome Vitrioline Marca&s;ites, over which
<PB N="103" REF="70"> it may pa&s;s, and meeting near the place with all this matter that is fermentative, a fermentation may ari&s;e &s;ufficiently productive of what heat we find; con&s;idering e&s;pecially the clo&s;ene&s;s of the Caverns of the Earth in which it is bred, where little air can abate it, but rather by that advantage, reduplicate the heat.</P>
<P>Much to this purpo&s;e are the words of that In|genious and Learned Phy&s;ician Dr. <HI>Sherley,</HI> who&s;e Philo&s;ophical E&s;&s;ay came late to my hands, and &s;ome con&s;iderable time after I had framed, and in the&s;e words written, my own Hypothe&s;is; yet in regard &s;ome coincidencies, though at this di|&s;tance, and without any conver&s;e, have happen'd, which may confirm and illu&s;trate what is before di&s;cour&s;ed, I &s;hall, by his permi&s;&s;ion, crave leave to &s;ay, That if the words I now recite be under|&s;tood of the Bath-waters, as he intended them of Water in general, the duration and equality of the&s;e Waters will be better under&s;tood, and found to be according as I have before a&s;&s;erted. He therefore &s;aith in the beginning of the eighth Se|ction of this Philo&s;ophical E&s;&s;ay, p. 112. <HI>In the beginning God infu&s;ed into the bo&s;om of the Waters the Seeds of all tho&s;e things that were afterwards to be made out of the Waters, &s;etting them their con|&s;tant rules and laws of acting, and by the power of the words,</HI> Increa&s;e <HI>and</HI> Multiply, <HI>they had a faculty given them to continue them&s;elves in the &s;ame order till the World &s;hall be de&s;troyed by fire; at which time all Seminal beings &s;hall de&s;ert their gro&s;s bodies, and return to their fir&s;t fountain and grand Exemplar, GOD, on whom they have at this time a con&s;tant de|pendance.</HI></P>
<P>This I am apt to believe might be made de|mon&s;trative, if digging about the Baths might be
<PB N="104" REF="71"> admitted and practic'd without prejudice to the Springs, which, 'tis feared, will en&s;ue, and there|fore I mu&s;t be content with that kind of Demon|&s;tration, which Art will afford in imitation of Na|ture, &s;ome of which I could now propo&s;e; but I will not prevent my &s;elf in things of this nature, and therefore &s;hall end this Subject for the pre&s;ent with the&s;e two Remarks:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That the Baths having the &s;ame Minerals, and but little differing in proportion neither, mu&s;t be equally advantagious in the &s;ame di&s;tempers, but with this difference, that the different degrees of Heat altering &s;omewhat the ca&s;e, judgment mu&s;t ad|vi&s;e what Bath the Patient &s;hall be committed to; how long it may be convenient to &s;tay, and what government is to be u&s;ed more in one Bath than another, be&s;ides the determination of the Di&s;temper 'tis proper to relieve.</P>
<P>And, Secondly, Whereas great di&s;cour&s;e hath ari&s;en here concerning the conveyance of &s;ome Nuts that were ob&s;erved in the Ci&s;tern over the main Spring of the Kings Bath, upon the altera|tion of a firm &s;tone cro&s;s in the middle, to that pretty Wooden device that now &s;tands there; &s;ome whereof were black and rotten, others fre&s;h with their kernels in them, and &s;ome with &s;hales very green about them: the way of pa&s;&s;age may be con|ceived to have been by the currents of Cold water from an open Spring, if not the River, near a Cop|pice or Wood-&s;ide, with which the water of the Bath may in part be &s;upply'd, the Bath being, as I &s;uppo&s;e, the great Exchequer, into which the le&s;&s;er Rivulets do return their tribute, and to which they pay their homage, as to their Liege Lord and Soveraign, con&s;tituted &s;uch by Him, by whom Kings reign, and from whom alone they receive their Scep|ters.
<PB N="105" REF="71"> That the&s;e Nuts could not come, by a nearer cut, from the Bath-&s;ide, is mo&s;t evident from this, That the Ci&s;tern was &s;o well plai&s;ter'd about with Plai&s;ter of equal hardne&s;s with a &s;tone, that it co&s;t very many blows to get it up; pre&s;ently from the ri&s;e of which the Nuts did appear, immediately &s;hot up from the Springs them&s;elves.</P>
<P>As to the Internal u&s;e of the Waters, &s;o much of late applauded, and not without cau&s;e;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Dr.</HI> Ven|ner <HI>Tr. of</HI> Bathe, p. 12.</NOTE> as a grave Phy&s;ician, &s;ometime of this Place, hath in his Wri|tings condemned that, the Rea&s;on of which he ne|ver under&s;tood; &s;o would not I on the contrary, give my Vote for that which I had not throughly examin'd, and on good grounds judged and found advantagious.</P>
<P>It being therefore clear, that Vitrioline, Nitrous, and Saline &s;prings, are recommended by the mo&s;t Intelligent Writers to be u&s;ed as a drink; and the forementioned Salts, the two latter fixt and vi&s;ible to the eye, the former more invi&s;ible, tran&s;ient and halituous, being contained in the Waters, I may conclude them by good con&s;equence to be potable and mo&s;t proper to be drank. Neither is the heat offen&s;ive, but amicable to the &s;tomach, and doth not of it &s;elf, unle&s;s ingurgitation procure it, incline to Vomit. But becau&s;e the drinking of the Wa|ters hath &s;o much obtain'd, I have the more par|ticularly di&s;cours'd of that in the two following Chapt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">rs.</P>

<P>HAving in the clo&s;e of the former Chapter de|bated and determin'd in &s;hort the Que&s;tion, Whether the Bath-water may be &s;afely u&s;ed inward|ly, and on good grounds carried it in the Affirma|tive: The next Thing I am to proceed to, is, The manner how, and what cour&s;e is to be taken by tho&s;e that would u&s;e it &s;o as to find benefit thereby.

<DIV3 TYPE="objection">
<HEAD>An OBJECTION.</HEAD>
<P>It may then be &s;aid; That the Bath-Water, ac|cording to pre&s;ent di&s;coveries, containing tho&s;e In|gredients that may be prejudicial to the Body, the u&s;e of them in potion may not &s;eem to be &s;afe, and the be&s;t way to decry the internal u&s;e, is to Anato|mize their body, and declare their Contents; &s;ome of which being gritty, and of a Lapideous nature, may ob&s;truct the me&s;entery, milky veins, and other pa&s;&s;ages, and conduce much to the heaping up a fa|bulous matter in the Body, and thereby give occa&s;i|on to the intolerable excruciations of the Stone and Gout, be&s;ides the foundation it may lay for other di&s;tempers; others being of a relaxing and effemi|nating nature, may have no good effect and influence upon the Nervous parts, e&s;pecially the Stomach and
<PB N="107" REF="72"> inte&s;tines, through which they pa&s;s; and therefore this u&s;e of the Waters &s;eems rather to be avoided, and the inconveniences ari&s;ing in probability from &s;ome parts <HI>non</HI>-&s;aline, may be thought much to overbear the advantages expected from the Salts.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>The ANSWER.</HEAD>
<P>To this, I think the Sub&s;tance of all that can be objected, I return this An&s;wer;</P>
<P>That the &s;uppo&s;ed Culpable parts in and about the Contents of the Bath-water, being only three, Grit, Bitumen and Sulphur, the former, though in the greate&s;t proportion, is &s;o finely wrought and intimately mixed with the Body of the Waters, that in truth it cannot de&s;erve that name, and there|fore I call it &s;o in relation to the more brown and gritty, appearing on Evaporation,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Ob&s;.</HI> 83.</NOTE> as I have el&s;e|where ob&s;erv'd; this then in the Waters that are drank being &s;oft and impalpabable, and no magi&s;te|ry more finely pulveriz'd, mu&s;t pa&s;s in Conjunction with the Water through all its Meanders; neither is the &s;tay u&s;ually &s;o long in the Body, as to occa&s;ion any fear of a Separation, which probably may be if they pa&s;s not well, and therein chiefly, I &s;uppo&s;e, to lye the danger, the natural heat being not &s;o vio|lent, but of a more moderate and even tenour, and too weak to make an analy&s;is of the Water in &s;o &s;hort a time, or di&s;&s;olve its body, as the fire doth, but having di&s;charged its office, is di&s;charged al&s;o by the u&s;ual ways of Evacuation, if the Water &s;tay not in the Body too long.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, The benefit of this In&s;ipid magi&s;tery may not be a little; for if the acrimony of the blood be abated, and &s;harp humours allay'd, miti|gated
<PB N="108" REF="73"> and dulcifi'd, as the Experience of many per|&s;ons, the two Summers la&s;t pa&s;t e&s;pecially &s;eem to te&s;tifie; I know nothing el&s;e in the Waters I can attribute this effect with greater ju&s;tice to, than this impalpable powder, which like Coral and Pearls, being in them&s;elves gritty and in&s;ipid, are known to produce the &s;ame effects without preju|dice to the body, by imbibing the Acrimony, or altering the property of tho&s;e humors they are found to allay. I confe&s;s indeed, &s;ome expecta|tion might in rea&s;on be of a fermentation within, as by the means of this powder, in good part&punc; there probably hath been without in the Waters them|&s;elves, according to my Hypothe&s;is mentioned in the former Chapter, if the Powder were &s;eparated and immediately mixed with acids in the Bowels, Stomach, Spleen, or el&s;ewhere, upon which, Eru|ctations, Inflations, and other inconveniences might en&s;ue; but the Water pa&s;&s;ing quickly off, and there being not that con&s;tant &s;upply as underground, nor proportionable acids neither, as may be there, no &s;uch ill effects can rea&s;onably be fear'd, nor yet have been ob&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Bitumen,</HI> either Liquid or Solid, the fir&s;t of which is chiefly condemned by Mineral Writers, no inconvenience can ari&s;e from that, in regard I do not conceive it mixed, or indeed capable of mixing with the body of the Waters, but is at &s;ome certain times eructed from the Springs, chiefly in the Months of <HI>June, July</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> it a&s;cends, being driven through the Waters, without mixture, to the &s;urface, and there remains as a Scum, which taken off and dried burns like Stone-pitch, and is noted el&s;ewhere:<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Ob&s;. <HI>100.</HI></NOTE> So that the quantity being in|con&s;iderable to any other of the Minerals, and the times of breeding and appearing not con&s;tant, with
<PB N="109" REF="73"> an incapacity of mixing with the body of the Wa|ters, otherwi&s;e certainly it would not a&s;cend and float on the &s;urface as we find it doth: the&s;e things, I &s;ay, con&s;idered, I cannot but think it &s;trange, the Learned Dr. <HI>Jorden</HI> &s;hould a&s;&s;ert the&s;e Baths to be Bituminous <HI>&agrave; praedominio,</HI> or con&s;i&s;t principally of Bitumen, which I &s;hall hereafter make appear to be but a le&s;s principal Principle, and rather an ap|purtenance to, than an Ingredient in the waters. So much al&s;o I mu&s;t further &s;ay, That the &s;wim|ming of a Bituminous &s;ub&s;tance on the &s;urface of the waters; the &s;hrivelling of the tops of the fingers in the Bath; and the bare &s;mell of Sulphur by the Baths-&s;ide; are no ma&s;culine foundations for a&s;|&s;erting tho&s;e Principles, and making <HI>that</HI> the great|e&s;t ingredient in the waters, that is not capable of mixing with them.</P>
<P>Whereas <HI>Sulphur</HI> (the third Ingredient of Dr. <HI>Jorden,</HI> and lea&s;t proportionable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">N. B. <HI>Ch.</HI> 16. <HI>p.</HI> 150.</NOTE> affirming the Baths to con&s;i&s;t principally of Bitumen, with Nitre and &s;ome Sulphur) is in much greater proportion than the Bitumen mentioned but now, and contains, I judge, near a fourth part of the cour&s;er Contents, the re&s;ult of evaporation, for &s;o much or there|bouts is lo&s;t in Calcination, this, I &s;ay, though much in quantity, cannot relax or effeminate, either by fattine&s;s or otherwi&s;e, as &s;ome Authors pretend; for, whatever it may have of that, 'tis certainly &s;o much alter'd by the other Ingredients into who&s;e bo&s;om it is taken, and to which it is &s;o nearly u|nited, that nothing of that nature doth appear at any time, and is in nothing di&s;covered more than its inflammability. We ought therefore here to expect the known vertues and benefits of Sulphur, to befriend the Lungs, to comfort and cheri&s;h weak parts, and do all tho&s;e good offices we experience
<PB N="110" REF="74"> in a Compo&s;ition though made of many things be|&s;ides, rather than to imagine the Water of the Foun|tain <HI>Salmacis,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Salmacis,</HI> fons Cariae limpidi&s;&s;i|mus, juxta <HI>Halicar|na&s;&s;ium;</HI> eo nomine olim mal&egrave; audiens, qu&ograve;d la|vantium in eo, aut ex eo bibenti|um corpora effoemina|ret. <HI>Ste|phanus.</HI></NOTE> to be continued hither, or be fright|ed with any <HI>Sardanapalian</HI> nature in Sulphur, which may create inconveniences we know not what. But if any per&s;on, notwith&s;tanding what hath been &s;aid to the contrary, may be in &s;ome &s;u&s;picion of any no|cument from the Sulphur, he may have a Salt made out of the Waters to be di&s;&s;olved in it, in which Sulphur is not concern'd, and &s;o the Waters may be drank in le&s;&s;er proportion.</P>
<P>Having therefore combated the&s;e three &s;uppo&s;ed Enemies to the Waters inward u&s;e, and found them weak and in&s;ufficient to maintain the oppo&s;ition they pretend to, the greater confirmation will accrue from the con&s;ideration of the three-fold encourage|ment, ari&s;ing from the mixture of the triple Salt, Nitre, Salt and Vitriol, the further enlargement on which I &s;hall at pre&s;ent forbear, and now give &s;ome few directions for the Patient's benefit I men|tioned before.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of which is, That 'tis very nece&s;&s;ary the Body be well prepar'd before the Waters be ta|ken, and con&s;equently that good advice be had whe|ther it be proper or no, for the incon&s;iderate u&s;e of any thing mu&s;t be very prejudicial; and the be&s;t rea|&s;on why many Effects are not produc'd, is becau&s;e in rea&s;on they could not be expected. This prepa|ration mu&s;t be made, not &s;lightly with a little Bath-water and Salt, Syrup of Ro&s;es, and Manna, and &s;uch like alimentary Medicines, but with proper, effectual, and frequent Purgations, as the knowing Phy&s;ician will think requi&s;ite &s;ometimes. For what Impurities are <HI>in primis viis,</HI> the Stomach, Inte|&s;tines, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will certainly with the Current be car|ried further into the Body, defile the blood, and
<PB N="111" REF="74"> thereby create an Iliad of evils; whereas if the Bo|dy be well prepar'd, the Water hath be&s;ides a cleaner pa&s;&s;age, a more free one too, unto the parts it mu&s;t relieve.</P>
<P>'Tis al&s;o le&s;s beneficial for the Patient to drink the Water in the Bath, and contrary to the rules and directions of intelligent Phy&s;icians; but if thir&s;t be trouble&s;om, &s;omewhat may be taken to al|lay that, and half an hour before ri&s;ing a quantity may be drank, and the re&s;t in bed, if occa&s;ion &s;hall require; otherwi&s;e to &s;et a&s;ide &s;ome time for drink|ing alone, and never, during that time, to u&s;e the Bath at all, is what may give both U&s;es due liberty to exert their operations, and not cramp or &s;upplant one another, as they often do when made u&s;e of together.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e requi&s;ite that a good cour&s;e of Diet be ob&s;erved in the u&s;e of the Waters, both as to Meat and Drink; that dinner be of meats of light and ea&s;ie dige&s;tion, at twelve or one a clock, when the Waters have made a con&s;iderable pa&s;s; and that &s;upper be in good time, that the Body may be clear again&s;t the next morning again.</P>
<P>The be&s;t time for drinking is in the morning ear|ly, from the Pump, at the place it &s;elf, if it may be, otherwi&s;e, if near, at home, very warm, with a quarter of an hours walking after every Pint or Quart, at utmo&s;t; ari&s;ing from three to &s;ix pints, four to eight, or five to ten, as the Body will bear, for no &s;et gage can be given; and the be&s;t Rule is, that it ought to be taken <HI>pro Tolerantia,</HI> every one as they are able to bear, without ingurgitation, or relucting again. The number of days, 7, 14, 21, or a month, after which time I have ob&s;erv'd the like effects not to be produc'd, as in the intermedi|ate &s;pace, and therefore none ought to u&s;e it longer at one &s;ea&s;on.</P>

<P>To give a greater &s;ecurity and Credit to the drinking the&s;e Waters, with which I &s;hall conclude this Chapter, it may be noted, That, be&s;ides the common Di&s;cour&s;e of things within the memory of

<P>About an hour after Sun-ri&s;ing in the morning, drink the Water out of the Spring; the Body afore purged, the dige&s;tion fulfilled, and the Bath fir&s;t clean&s;ed, remaining clean &s;ix hours before.</P>
<P>So much of the Water as &s;hall not be grievous to the Stomach may be drank.</P>
<P>The Water being drank, the Patient mu&s;t walk gently a few paces in a temperate air.</P>
<P>By which it appears, how careful they were then of preparing the Body, and having the Water pure, which ought not to be le&s;s regarded now, other|wi&s;e the danger will be more, and the benefit le&s;s, according to the right or wrong u&s;e of the Waters. That this was di&s;continu'd, no better rea&s;on, I think, can be given, than the Humour of the Times, to which al&s;o, a want of a due method in drinking, and a true under&s;tanding of the nature of the Wa|ters, may much conduce.</P>

<PB N="115" REF="76">
<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XIV.</HI> Of the Virtues of the Bath-water taken inwardly.</HEAD>
<P>THat the Water, and con&s;equently the Salt ex|tracted from it, and di&s;&s;olved in it, may not be defrauded of their ju&s;t Commendation internally u&s;ed by way of Potion, as well as by Bathing, or Lotion, outwardly, and that it may be rightly made u&s;e of in a due way and manner, without expecting more from it than in rea&s;on is to be done; I &s;hall give a &s;hort Account of the Di&s;tempers in which it may be profitable, and u&s;ed with advan|tage.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, in General, I conceive it very proper in all Di&s;ea&s;es or Symptoms, that require cooling, clean&s;ing, opening, or gentle Evacuation; under which Heads are comprehended many Maladies, which I &s;hall but briefly touch on, and leave the fuller di&s;covery of its Virtues to experience, and a longer u&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall begin with the Stomach, both in regard it is the part it fir&s;t de&s;cends into, and al&s;o, becau&s;e in righting that, it is a general Benefactor to the whole Body, the u&s;e of the Stomach being of ab&s;olute ne|ce&s;&s;ity to every part, without which there can be no &s;upply.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t therefore infallibly clean&s;e this u&s;eful Re|ceptacle from any impurities lodging in the Bottom or Plicatures thereof, (which may render what is taken in more foul) and prepare it the better for dige&s;tion of the food, on which depends the main|tenance
<PB N="116" REF="77"> of the le&s;&s;er Univer&s;e, conducing much this way to the making better Chyle, purer blood, and more clear and active &s;pirits, the wheels and ma|chines of all &s;en&s;e and motion.</P>
<P>The next Advantage is, That it procures an Ap|petite, and makes tho&s;e that drink it receive and enjoy their food with more delight and &s;atisfaction. This is generally known to all that u&s;e it, and is ef|fected partly by removing what lines the inner Coat of the Stomach with too much Vi&s;co&s;ity, with which the fibres, and nervous filaments, the Organs of Sen&s;ation, are ob&s;tructed; partly by an E&s;urine quality re&s;iding in the Salt, provoking the de&s;ire of Su&s;tenance, which we call Hunger, by its immedi|ate application to the parts mentioned before. And in this E&s;urine Quality it doth exceed Common Water, of which <HI>Hippocrates</HI> hath written, That it makes men hungry; <HI>viz.</HI> by its wa&s;hing and clean&s;ing the Stomach, as is declared before; but this by the mixture of the Salt, is made more ef|fectual.</P>
<P>A third Convenience is, That it allays Thir&s;t, which is often very trouble&s;om, and &s;ometimes dan|gerous to take in Liquors to &s;uppre&s;s it, that may create farther di&s;turbances in the Body, and prove more offen&s;ive; whereas this, by its cooling and moi&s;tening nature, is the be&s;t Remedy that can be provided, and that in no great proportion neither, as hath been often experimented.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o of good u&s;e in the Heart-burning, or <HI>Cardialgia,</HI> occa&s;ioned by the &s;harpne&s;s and acri|mony of a bilious humour, vellicating the nerves and membranes of the upper orifice of the Sto|mach, called by the Ancients, by rea&s;on of its great communication therewith, the Heart; which &s;harp and acrimonious humour it alters, wa&s;hes off, and
<PB N="117" REF="77"> at la&s;t evacuates, upon which the Pa&s;&s;ion cea&s;eth, and ea&s;e doth en&s;ue.</P>
<P>Al&s;o it clears by its immediate pa&s;&s;age out of the Stomach, for &s;ome water, I &s;uppo&s;e, doth pa&s;s that way, whatever ob&s;tructions are found in the Ve&s;|&s;els about the Stomach, relating either to that or the Caul, ari&s;ing from the <HI>Vena Porta,</HI> and known commonly among Anatomi&s;ts by the hard names of <HI>Venae Ga&s;tricae, Epiplociae,</HI> and <HI>Ga&s;tro-Epiplociae,</HI> conveying what is tran&s;mitted from the Celiack Ar|tery, to the Liver, and &s;o by the <HI>Vena Cava,</HI> to the Heart, according to the undoubted and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed doctrine of the Circulation.</P>
<P>Moreover, It is of &s;ingular u&s;e in all Fluxes, whether with blood, or without; Diarrhea's, Dy|&s;enteries, or bloody Urine; not that it hath any &s;trong a&s;tringent quality, which oftentimes is pre|judicial, but by its ab&s;terging and clean&s;ing virtue, and gently evacuative withal, it allays Acrimony, &s;weeps away pungent particles, and di&s;charges them by the draught. However, if a&s;tringent Medicines &s;hall at any time be judged nece&s;&s;ary, the Cure will be facilitated, and more &s;peedily performed, if the Water be drank, or u&s;ed by Cly&s;ter, or both ways made u&s;e of, before they are advi&s;ed, which will be a good preparatory to other Remedies.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o good in the Colick, on the account be|fore &s;pecified, and with the addition of its Heat; in&s;omuch that tho&s;e that drink the Bath-water, are ob&s;erved to break more wind than other people, and find great relief in that ca&s;e.</P>
<P>It is proper al&s;o in the Di&s;temper that is com|monly, though improperly, called the Heat of the Liver, when the Face is red, pimpled, and the Bo|dy afflicted with cholerick and pu&s;tulous Eruptions, having its foundation in the blood, which the Wa|ter
<PB N="118" REF="78"> attemperates, and brings down to a ju&s;t degree, proportionable to the Natural and Bal&s;amick Tem|per of its prime Compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>It opens likewi&s;e the ob&s;tructions of the Liver, Spleen and Gall, and therefore proper in the Spleen, &s;o far as it ari&s;eth from that Cau&s;e, and not impro|per, but very advantagious, in the Scurvy, Jaundi&s;e, and ob&s;tructions of the Me&s;entery, which, if the Waters pa&s;s, mu&s;t be much advantage to the Body; in regard there mo&s;t commonly lyes the <HI>Sentina Corporis,</HI> or Sink of the whole, which is clean&s;ed this way, as the Sewers in <HI>Bri&s;tow,</HI> by St. <HI>David</HI>'s Flood.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o very beneficial, if moderately taken, in the Gravel of the Kidneys, or any Gravel or Phlegm ob&s;tructing them, or the Ureters, which it undeni|ably clean&s;eth, and prevents Concretions, which may afterward terminate in Tophes and Stones; &s;o that 'tis a good pre&s;ervative again&s;t the Stone, and will di&s;&s;olve what is not too firmly impacted, which may be di&s;cover'd, if the water pa&s;s not freely that way.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o of incomparable u&s;e in the <HI>Diabetes,</HI> or pi&s;&s;ing Di&s;ea&s;e, which is u&s;ually attended with a great drought, which it allays above any thing; and, the quantity moderated for fear of pi&s;&s;ing too much, produces great effects, as hath been experi|enced of late by a Per&s;on of Honour.</P>
<P>I doubt not al&s;o to commend it in the Drop&s;ie, but care mu&s;t be taken that it pa&s;s well away, other|wi&s;e it may prove more prejudicial than advan|tagious. The like al&s;o may be &s;aid of the Gout.</P>
<P>'Tis beneficial likewi&s;e in the Whites in Women, and what is &s;omewhat con&s;equential, prepares them for Conception; &s;o that in &s;ome kinds of Barren|ne&s;s,
<PB N="119" REF="78"> no more effectual Medicine can be u&s;ed. <HI>Pli|nius dicit, Aquarum aliquas &s;terilitatem foeminarum abolere, &amp; conceptus ip&s;is repre&s;entare, &s;icut</HI> Sinue&s;|&s;anas <HI>in</HI> Campania; The&s;piarum <HI>fontis in</HI> Boeotia; Elati <HI>fluminis in</HI> Arcadia; <HI>qui effectus &s;ignificant hu|ju&s;modi Aquas e&s;&s;e Nitro&s;as: Etenim hae vulvam, quo|niam eam ab&s;tergunt, Conceptioni faciunt habilem,</HI> &s;aith <HI>Georg.

<P>The Drink, or Water, which de&s;cends into the Stomach by the Gullet, pa&s;&s;es thence, either imme|diately by the Veins, that have a more immediate relation to the Stomach, Caul, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or mediately, by the lower orifice of the Stomach, called <HI>Pylorus,</HI> into the Guts, whence the mo&s;t part pa&s;&s;eth by the milky Veins to the <HI>Lumbar glandules,</HI> or Kernels of the Kidneys, a&s;cribed to the Learned D. <HI>Th.

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XV.</HI> Of the Water of St. <HI>Vincent</HI>'s Rock, near <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HAving in the 12th. Chapter of this Di&s;cour&s;e made &s;ome mention of this Water, as a neighbouring Water to <HI>Bathe,</HI> and &s;uppo&s;ed only a Continuation thither, which I did not think pro|bable on the Rea&s;ons there alledged; it will not be altogether improper in this place, to treat a little more largely of that, which hath a name among the u&s;eful Mineral Waters of this Land.</P>
<P>As to the Principles of this Hot-Well Water, as 'tis u&s;ually call'd, without which the Rea&s;on of the Virtues can never be under&s;tood, they have been variou&s;ly reported; what I have found on my own ob&s;ervation, I here declare.</P>
<P>On the Evaporation of two Gallons of the Wa|ter, I had &scruple;v. of the Contents; of which &scruple;iv. were a reddi&s;h ferrugineous Earth, &s;omewhat re|&s;embling in colour, an Iron Ore, but in &s;ub&s;tance, very light and friable, with a mixture of a Lime-&s;tone: The other &scruple;. which the Lixivium gave me, evaporated in Gla&s;s, &s;eemed to be Alom, yet in re|gard the Lime-&s;tone may counterfeit Alom, e&s;peci+ally when precipitated, I could not ab&s;olutely con|clude it to be Aluminous.</P>
<P>To be a little better &s;atisfied, I cau&s;ed Mr. <HI>Ri|chard Millechape,</HI> an indu&s;trious and skilful Apothe|cary in <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> to evaporate one Hog&s;head of the Water of the Hot-Well, which he did in a furnace, fir&s;t, to three or four Gallons, afterwards fini&s;hed
<PB N="123" REF="80"> it in an evaporating Gla&s;s, and &s;ent me the Con|tents, which were little wanting of &ounce;v &s;s. four Ounces of which were, on examination, that red, ru&s;ty colour'd Earth, mentioned before, and &s;ome|what, though much le&s;s in quantity, more white.</P>
<P>Upon this <HI>non</HI>-Saline part, as I call it, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h it from the Saline part that con&s;titutes the Lixivium, being put into a Crucible and calcin'd, I ob&s;erv'd: That the red Earth was not harder, but more friable, and lo&s;t its ru&s;ty colour, becoming more blew; but the white being cold, and mixed with fair water, did, upon the fir&s;t injection, hi&s;s, and afterwards di&s;&s;olve, leaving the water white, and a Limy re&s;idence in the bottom of the Ve&s;&s;el I infu&s;ed it in; and both white and blew, after infu|&s;ion, being dryed again, became very white and limy.</P>
<P>The other part being Saline imbibed into a Lixi|vium, I evaporated away to half a Pint, and &s;et|ting it in a cool pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">, found the next morning, it had &s;hot into long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">nall Stiria's, much re&s;embling tho&s;e of the Cro&s;s Bath here, to the quantity of &dram;iii. the remaining part of the Liquor that did not &s;hoot, I breath'd away, and had &ounce;i. of another kind of Salt, now under examination; &s;o that the Saline part is here much exceeded by the <HI>non</HI>-Saline, to which it &s;eems to bear proportionably not much more than a 5th. part, and to be contained accor|ding to this E&s;timate, &s;carce twelve Grains in a Gallon, whereas that of <HI>Bathe</HI> hath about forty impure.</P>
<P>To give then a &s;hort Account of the Principles of this Water, I judg it to con&s;i&s;t of Iron, a Nitro-Sulphureous Salt, and &s;ome Lime-&s;tone, according to the proportions before deliver'd, and the Con|tents
<PB N="124" REF="81"> tents Saline, and <HI>non</HI>-Saline, to be, in all, near half as much as in the Waters of <HI>Bathe,</HI> where the Salts are a third, and here a fifth, or thereabout, as was mentioned before.</P>
<P>That very little of an acid is contained in the&s;e Waters, may appear from this, That neither the cold Water, nor a &s;trong Lixivium made of the Salt, will either turn with Galls, or coagulate Milk; neither doth any thing glebous &s;hew it &s;elf among the Shoots I have had yet.</P>
<P>What the other Salt is, which I have not yet ful|ly examin'd, and ta&s;ts much Alcalizate, I do here promi&s;e to declare on another occa&s;ion: only for the pre&s;ent, which is all I &s;hall &s;ay of the Principles of this Water now, To make it further evident, that this is Lime-&s;tone, after the <HI>non</HI>-Saline part was well calcin'd, with a &s;trong fire, in the water of that I decocted Sulphur, which it did di&s;&s;olve, and was precipitated with a fetid &s;mell, both by di|&s;till'd Vinegar, Spirit of Vitriol, and Oyl of Tar|tar, in a con&s;iderable quantity.</P>
<P>This Water then though participating of the &s;ame Salts with the Water of <HI>Bathe,</HI> but not in that proportion, cannot be expected to be as advantagi|ous in the &s;ame Di&s;tempers, as it is le&s;s hot; but containing &s;o much of Iron, hath that advantage above it, and may be as effectual as <HI>Tunbridg</HI> Wa|ters, in any Di&s;ea&s;es that Water is proper for, and, for ought I know, do every way as well.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. XVI.</HI> Of <HI>Ca&s;tle-Cary</HI> Water.</HEAD>
<P>THE Mineral Water in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> common|ly known by the name of <HI>Ca&s;tle-Cary,</HI> or <HI>Alford</HI>-water, being of a quick working nature, and by &s;ome per&s;ons made u&s;e of at <HI>Bathe,</HI> de&s;erves al&s;o an Examination; which I the rather do here, in regard it may confirm and illu&s;trate what I for|merly di&s;cour&s;t of, concerning the Nature and Vir|tues of the Baths of <HI>Bathe,</HI> to which it may be al&s;o very &s;ub&s;ervient.</P>
<P>By Tryals therefore, according as I had done on the Waters of <HI>Bathe</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> I find it to con&s;i&s;t of &s;ome parts Saline, &s;ome <HI>non</HI>-Saline. The Sa|line part is chiefly Nitrous, Nitre being almo&s;t double to the other Salts; and therefore I judg this Water, <HI>Nitro&s;a &agrave; praedominio;</HI> Nitre appearing in a nau&s;eous ta&s;te, apparent bitterne&s;s, cooling, pe|netrating, and &s;hooting into as long and firm Sti|ria's, as I have ever &s;een in the King's, or Hot Baths.</P>
<P>The other Salt, is common brown Salt, ari&s;ing, I conceive, from a &s;mall Rock or Mine, of that &s;ort of Salt in the ground about the Spring. This, I &s;aid, is little more than half the proportion of the former, and &s;hews it &s;elf in proper Squares or Cubes, peculiar to that Salt, the Nitre &s;hooting fir&s;t, and this Salt la&s;t of all.</P>
<P>The parts <HI>non</HI>-Saline are likewi&s;e double:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, A red Gritt, ari&s;ing al&s;o from a Rock of that colour, and is the proper Gritt of the ground;
<PB N="126" REF="82"> next the Earth under the Sward, of which I am now to treat a little. The Earth under the &s;urface of the ground is fir&s;t, a &s;tiff blew Marl: under that a white Clay: and la&s;t of all the Red Rock.</P>
<P>The Earth, the &s;econd part <HI>non</HI>-Saline contain|ed in the Water, is chiefly the latter, I mean the white Clay, which with the Rocky Sediment, makes up near the proportion of the brown Salt, or rather &s;omewhat more, the Rock bearing not a fourth part to the Clay.</P>
<P>Out of 12 Gallons of this Water wanting 3 Pints, I had &ounce;18. &dram;vi ss. of the Contents, be&s;ides dro&s;s and &s;cum in the depuration of the Water, of which &ounce;iii. Nitre; &ounce;i. &dram;vi. brown Salt; and &ounce;ii. Earth and Rock. &ounce;iii. gr. 30. lo&s;t in working. So that &ounce;ss. of Salt is contained in every Gallon of the Water, or proportionably &dram;ss. in every Pint, or between 20 and 30 Grains, of which two parts are Nitre, and one brown Salt.</P>
<P>Note, That out of the quantity of Water men|tioned before, I had of the pure refined Salt only &ounce;iv. 2 Drams, and 40 Grains, in a Gallon; 20 Grains in a Pint.</P>
<P>This Water then mu&s;t be of good u&s;e to cool, clean&s;e, penetrate and attenuate gro&s;s humours; allay acrimony; attemperate and &s;uppre&s;s undue fermentation. Good in the Spleen, Scurvy, Jaun|di&s;e, and all ob&s;tructions of the Me&s;entery and Bowels, having all tho&s;e properties <HI>Kircher</HI> gives of Nitrous Waters, mentioned <HI>Chap.</HI> 14.</P>
<P>It clean&s;es the Kidneys and Ureters, and is very beneficial in the Stone, moving by Siege, Urine and Sweat, and that very effectually, in regard the Minerals are &s;o &s;trongly imbibed, which makes it better to be mixed with the Water from the Springs
<PB N="127" REF="82"> at <HI>Bathe,</HI> which, having the &s;ame Salts are le&s;s, operative, becau&s;e le&s;s impregnated.</P>
<P>And thus having di&s;cours'd of Three Mineral Waters, by the Salts, the main of their Compo&s;iti|on, &s;omewhat related, St. <HI>Vincent</HI>'s <HI>Hot Well,</HI> le&s;s impregnated; <HI>Bathe,</HI> more; and <HI>Ca&s;tle-Cary Wa|ter,</HI> in the highe&s;t degree; I hope the be&s;t u&s;e will be made of them all. And &s;o I take leave of this Subject for the pre&s;ent, referring the Curious to more Particulars, concerning the principal part of my De&s;ign, to the en&s;uing <HI>Century of Ob&s;erva|tions.</HI></P>

<HEAD>4. Doctor <HI>Edward Jorden.</HI></HEAD>
<P>COncerning Dr. <HI>Jorden,</HI> who&s;e Name is yet fre&s;h, and memory very acceptable to all that knew him, having left the de&s;erved Reputation of a Learned, Candid, and Sober Phy&s;ician: I have written &s;omething heretofore, and &s;hall only here again mention &s;ome particulars more nearly relating to his per&s;on and condition.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Jorden,</HI> I under&s;tand, was a Gentleman of a good Family, and, being a younger Brother, de&s;igned for a Profe&s;&s;ion, for which when he had accompli&s;h't him&s;elf, by a convenient cour&s;e of &s;tudies in his own Country, he travelled abroad to &s;ee the Manners and Cu&s;tomes of the Univer&s;ities be|yond Sea, and having &s;pent &s;ome time there, e&s;pe|cially at <HI>Padua,</HI> where he took the degree of Doctor in Phy&s;ick, returned home, practiced at <HI>London,</HI> became an eminently &s;olid and rational Philo&s;opher and Phy&s;ician, and one of that famous and learned Society, <HI>The Kings Colledge of the Phy&s;icians there.</HI></P>
<P>He had a natural inclination to Mineral works, and was at great charges about the ordering of Alom, which &s;ucceeding not according to expecta|tion, he was thereby much prejudic'd in his e&s;tate, as appears from the&s;e words in the &s;eventh Chap|ter of his Treati&s;e of <HI>Nat. Bathes</HI> and <HI>Mineral Waters;</HI> Now I come to <HI>Allum (Indignum vex ip&s;a jubet renovare dolorem,)</HI> the greate&s;t debtor I have, and I the greate&s;t benefactor to it, as &s;hall appear when I think fit to publi&s;h the artifice thereof. For the Patent or Grant for the profit of the Alom works, which he rea&s;onably did expect,
<PB N="167" REF="102"> fell afterwards, I know not how, to Sr. <HI>Arthur In|grams</HI> lot, although the Doctor al&s;o had a good &s;hare in the affection of King <HI>James.</HI></P>
<P>After he had practi&s;ed &s;ometime in <HI>London,</HI> he &s;ettled at <HI>Bathe,</HI> where living many years, and ha|ving Children not a few, his conver&s;ation was &s;o &s;weet, his carriage &s;o obliging, and his life &s;o an|&s;werable to the port and dignity of the faculty he profe&s;t, that he had the applau&s;e of the Learned, the re&s;pect of the Rich, the prayers of the Poor, and the love of all. But living a &s;tudious and &s;e|dentary life, which might encourage his two grand di&s;tempers he labours under, the Stone and Gout, departed this life in the great Climacterical year of his age 63, and of our Saviours Nativity 1632, lying buried in the South I&s;le of the Abbey Church, but without a Monument, or any In&s;cription. And thus much for Dr. <HI>Jorden</HI> who was the fir&s;t Phy&s;i|cian that writ any thing of the Waters, that re&s;i|ded on the place.</P>

<P>His corre&s;pondence was good with <HI>Jorden,</HI> be|ing both at one time practicioners on the place, as appears from the ver&s;es he hath prefixt to Dr. <HI>Jor|den</HI> in <HI>Laudem operis.</HI> He had only one Daughter, who being married out of this place, cau&s;ed his

<P>The Author of this Epitaph, for who made it is uncertain, &s;eems rather to me to have been a Divine than a Phy&s;ician, for which conjecture I have the&s;e Rea&s;ons:</P>
<P N="1">1. That the form thereof is borrowed from one made on Doctor <HI>Daniel Featley,</HI> now in <HI>Lambeth,</HI> as I could clearly make appear by comparing the Expre&s;&s;ions, as I have &s;ometime done, and for the &s;atisfaction of any that de&s;ire it, may without a journey thither, be read, <HI>mutatis mutandis,</HI> in Doctor <HI>Featley</HI>'s Book again&s;t the Anabapti&s;ts, where it is copied, and whence it was probably taken. Now a Phy&s;ician, I conceive, would never have taken pattern from a Divine, to make an Epitaph on his own faculty, which is proper for a Divine, being more his concern.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Venerandus</HI> is a word &s;uiting better with a Divine, and a more proper Epithete than for a Phy&s;ician, as <HI>Reverendus &amp; Venerabilis;</HI> and is mo&s;t likely to have come from one who&s;e tongue was tipp'd with &s;uch language, who vvould rather chu&s;e to run the ri&s;que of an impropriety in &s;peech, than lo&s;e the honour of a jingling quib|ble.</P>
<P N="3">3. 'Tis probable this Epitaph was made near a Church, and that either when the Bells were go|ing,
<PB N="172" REF="105"> or el&s;e in imitation of that &s;ound, as may ap|pear from the Chime of <HI>Hoc</HI> and <HI>Illo, Horum</HI> and <HI>Illorum, His</HI> and <HI>Illis,</HI> with the great pains taken to ob&s;erve the Cadences &s;o exactly as is done.</P>
<P N="4">4. In the fourth place, the word <HI>plus</HI> is &s;ome|what &s;u&s;picious, by which vve mu&s;t under&s;tand <HI>Minus,</HI> otherwi&s;e, <HI>Nec plus defuit &s;anis quam aegris paupe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ibus,</HI> may bear this &s;en&s;e, and not well any other, <HI>that the Doctor was wanting both to the one and the other,</HI> vvhen the Author, I &s;uppo&s;e, meant <HI>he was wanting to neither.</HI> Now <HI>Plus</HI> is a fit word for a divine, and might the &s;ooner have been made choice of for this, that 'tis the origin or &s;our&s;e of the word <HI>Plurality.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly and la&s;tly; No Phy&s;ician would have u&s;ed that Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Theoriam unius anni confir|mans Praxi</HI> 85, by vvhich Doctor <HI>Venner</HI> is made a Practicioner from his Mothers womb, and longer a Phy&s;ician than St. <HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> was a Prophet, which in it &s;elf being &s;omewhat har&s;h, though ta|ken in relation to his cour&s;e of life, vvhere the life of that expre&s;&s;ion lay, can proceed from none but a Divine, vvho oftentimes will be nibbling at Phy&s;ick.</P>
<P>Again, for I re&s;erved &s;omething for a &s;econd part, That expre&s;&s;ion is ju&s;tly liable to exception, <HI>Quod Charitatem &s;olus hic tamdiu exercui&s;&s;et,</HI> where|in Dr. <HI>Venner</HI> is made the only Charitable per&s;on in <HI>Bathe,</HI> whereas there vvere then living, be&s;ides &s;ome Charitable Inhabitants of another &s;tamp, three or four more Phy&s;icians there, who&s;e Charity, though perhaps not &s;o rampant as Dr. <HI>Venners,</HI> was enough both in food and Phy&s;ick to call the truth of that expre&s;&s;ion into que&s;tion.</P>
<PB N="173" REF="105">
<P>And although this nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;ite to every good Chri&s;tian that is in a condition &s;o to do, be not with that o&s;tentation put into the Epitaph of Dr. <HI>Baue.</HI> Yet I have heard a good Character of him al&s;o in this kind, and do know many poor per&s;ons now alive in <HI>Bathe,</HI> that will affirm they have re|ceived good Alms and Phy&s;ick too from his Cha|rity. I confe&s;s <HI>Tamdiu</HI> may do &s;ome &s;ervice here, to this effect, that Dr. <HI>Venner</HI> vvas the only man that was charitable here &s;o long, which, though it may abate &s;omewhat, doth not take off the arro|gance of <HI>Solus,</HI> which, like the Sun, never appears without reflection. I vvrite not this to derogate from Dr. <HI>Venner,</HI> or di&s;parage the Epitaph, having that e&s;teem for both they do de&s;erve; but as the Devil, we &s;ay, &s;hould have his due, &s;o I think, 'tis not fitting a Saint &s;hould have more. And thus much for the Charitable Dr. <HI>Venner.</HI></P>

<HEAD>7. Dr. <HI>Ralph Bayly.</HI></HEAD>
<P>DOctor <HI>Ralph Bayly,</HI> of whom I am next to treat, was well known to all his Collegues of <HI>New-Colledge</HI> in <HI>Oxon,</HI> where he had his Edu|cation, to be as &s;tout a man as that Society hath yielded, having in his Temper an equal mixture of <HI>Mars</HI> and <HI>Mercury,</HI> or rather, born under the <HI>praedominium</HI> of <HI>Mars,</HI> as he hath often evidenced when he long'd for Veni&s;on, though &s;ometimes bought at a dear rate.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Bayly</HI> was born in <HI>Berk&s;hire,</HI> de&s;cended of a good Family in that County, who&s;e Coat-armour is, <HI>In a field Gules, three Martlets;</HI> or, <HI>A Chief Vairy Argent of Azure.</HI> Having &s;pent &s;ome time in <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> School, that fruitful Seminary of
<PB N="174" REF="106"> Learning, he was in due time tran&s;planted to <HI>New-Colledge</HI> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> where he gradually proceeded with good applau&s;e, till he arrived at the per|fection of Doctor of Phy&s;ick, which hapned in the year 1618. By two Wives, the one a <HI>Quintin,</HI> the other a <HI>Hungerford,</HI> both comely Women; he had i&s;&s;ue both Male and Female.</P>
<P>His elde&s;t Son <HI>Walter,</HI> my intimate friend and acquaintance, he educated in the Univer&s;ity, in <HI>Magdalen</HI> Hall in <HI>Oxford;</HI> but finding his genius not &s;o much inclining him to Learning, though he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> great admirer of it, and had much re&s;pect for any Scholar that was truly &s;o, and had Learn|ing enough him&s;elf to render him facetious, and as good company as any man could wi&s;h; finding, I &s;ay, his genius not &s;o much bent to &s;tudy, he rather cho&s;e a gentile Education, and being very acceptable to all per&s;ons of Quality, e&s;pecially the Gentry of <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> in particular Sr. <HI>Richard Gifford</HI> of <HI>Sumburne, Henry Ludlow</HI> of <HI>Tadley</HI> E&s;quire, and many others, where he u&s;ed to hunt and recreate with all the kindne&s;s imaginable; at la&s;t, on the death of his Father took to the E&s;tate, and &s;ettled at <HI>Bathe</HI> in the &s;ame hou&s;e the Doctor enjoy'd, where he lived plentifully many years, and &s;aw an end of all his Generation, till at length, for Death is the end as well of the good Compani|on as the Sot, of a lingring di&s;temper, being much ob&s;tructed in the Me&s;entery and Urinary pa&s;&s;ages; he ended this life about the &s;ixtieth year of his age, on the 15 day of <HI>November, An. Dom.</HI> 1672, and is buried in the Abbey Church in <HI>Bathe.</HI></P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Bayly</HI> is further remarkable in this, that he is the only man &s;ave one, of any Phy&s;ician that lived here; that had a Son of his own Profe&s;&s;ion, which was Mr. <HI>Thomas Bayly,</HI> by his &s;econd Wife
<PB N="175" REF="106"> Mrs. <HI>Hungerford,</HI> an Ingenious man, and good Phy|&s;ician, of whom his Brother would often &s;peak with much affection and re&s;pect, who in the be|ginning of the Wars, when no Acts were kept, was with many others, created Doctor <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 1642, and practi&s;ing at <HI>Newbury</HI> in <HI>Berk&s;hire,</HI> with good &s;ucce&s;s and reputation, died of a high infection in the prime of his years, not long after. He was much encouraged to the Delivery of Women, be|ing fitted for that &s;ervice both by art and na|ture.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o further ob&s;ervable in Doctor <HI>Ralph Bayly,</HI> that although he had good practi&s;e, and pre|&s;cribed to many Patients, yet &s;uch was his good Temper of Nature, and Temperance withal, that he never took any Phy&s;ick him&s;elf, or made u&s;e of the Bath, being never &s;ick in all his life; which fell the heavier on him, according to the vulgar ob&s;er|vation; for going from his hou&s;e at <HI>Bathe</HI> to ano|ther he had at <HI>Widcombe,</HI> a mile di&s;tant, he was &s;uddenly taken with a great faintne&s;s, in&s;omuch as he was con&s;trained to call at a Neighbours hou&s;e before he came to his own, to de&s;ire &s;omething to refre&s;h him, u&s;ing the&s;e words, <HI>as God &s;hall mend me,</HI> which was his u&s;ual &s;aying, <HI>I am ill,</HI> and pre&s;ently departed, and was buried at <HI>Widcombe,</HI> Nov. 16. 1645.</P>
<P>He was a proper, Comely per&s;on, charitable, and well read in the Ancient learning, witne&s;s a good Collection of old Authors, well markt with his own Hand, now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. And &s;o much for Dr. <HI>Ralph Bayly,</HI> being the only man, I think, that ever liv'd and dy'd without pain.</P>

<P>WIth Doctor <HI>Baue</HI> I had the happine&s;s to have a particular acquaintance, being the elde&s;t Phy&s;ician on the place at my coming hither, in the year 1667, and although many things are ob&s;ervable in his life and practi&s;e, having lived to &s;ee compleated four&s;core years, yet I &s;hall con|tract my &s;elf as much as may be, in regard I would not be tedious in a thing that ought to be brief.</P>
<P>Doctor <HI>Baue</HI> was born in the remarkable year 1588, at <HI>Colen</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> of a good Family, as appears by a good Coat of Arms brought thence, vvhence he came young for <HI>England,</HI> on occa&s;ion, as he told me, of his being Tutor to Sr. <HI>Thomas Ed|mond</HI>'s Son, which Sr. <HI>Thomas</HI> vvas Amba&s;&s;adour
