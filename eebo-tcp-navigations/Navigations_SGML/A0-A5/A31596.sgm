<HEAD>THE Pre&s;ent State OF ENGLAND. PART III.</HEAD>
<P>THE I&s;land of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> the large&s;t of the <HI>European</HI> I&s;lands, and to very few I&s;lands of the World inferiour in bigne&s;s, to none in Fertility, Power, Good Government and the Glory of its great Actions, lies between 52 and 58 degrees of <HI>Northern</HI> Latitude. <HI>England</HI> the noble&s;t and large&s;t part thereof, and a di&s;tinct King|dom of it &s;elf, though at pre&s;ent united un|der
<PB N="2" REF="7">
one Monarch, hath undergone four &s;e|veral grand Revolutions. Not to mention the <HI>Samotheans, Albioni&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Brutus</HI> his <HI>Trojan</HI> Dyna&s;tie, who&s;e credit depends ra|ther upon fabulous Tradition than real Hi|&s;tory, the ancient Inhabitants of this I&s;land are &s;carce taken notice of by any Author of account but by the name of <HI>Britains</HI>; and the fir&s;t certainly known Attaque that ever was made upon them, was by the <HI>Romans,</HI> under <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI>; and after that &s;everal others by the Lieutenants of &s;everal &s;uc|ceeding Emperors, not without a World of Blood&s;hed: The Natives no le&s;s &s;toutly re&s;i&s;ting, than the <HI>Romans</HI> furious a&s;&s;aul|ting, till at length they gain'd a no le&s;s quiet than perhaps advantageous Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion among us; I mean, advantageous to this I&s;land; &s;o that the Lo&s;ers may be &s;aid to have been the greate&s;t Gainers, the Con|quered the greate&s;t Triumphers: For if we con&s;ider, from the &s;everal De&s;criptions that have been written thereof, what bar|barous and ab&s;urd Cu&s;toms the Ancient <HI>Britains</HI> had among them; we may con|clude that Civility and Arts were &s;o much the earlier introduced by the coming in of the <HI>Romans</HI>; who al&s;o by their long Habi|tation here, and Familiar Conver&s;e with the Old Inhabitants, were of Foreigners

become as it were Natives, of Enemies Protectors, in&s;omuch that when they were call'd away for the Defence of their Pro|vinces Abroad, their Departure was no le&s;s regretted, than their Arrival was op|pos'd.</P>
<P>The next Attempters upon this part of the I&s;land were the <HI>Saxons,</HI> who being at fir&s;t Invited in for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the Invading <HI>Picts</HI> and other Borderers, became at length them&s;elves the greate&s;t Invaders; and playing upon the Ea&s;ie and Luxurious Temper of the Prince that fir&s;t Incourag'd their coming over, they got a Footing, which by continued fre&s;h Supplies &s;ent over from time to time, they made &s;o &s;ure, that all the Force the <HI>Britains</HI> were able to make again&s;t them for &s;everal Ages, was not able to unfix it. For notwith|&s;tanding this great Oppo&s;ition, in which &s;everal of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Kings Signaliz'd them|&s;elves, even to the Fame of Heroes, e&s;pe|cially the Great King <HI>Arthur,</HI> who&s;e Glory nothing hath &s;o much Eclips'd, as that his Actions (great enough in their Truth) are blown up into Storys, &s;o Romantick and and Surpa&s;&s;ing all Credit, maugre I &s;ay all the Force could be Mu&s;tered again&s;t them: They &s;till Increa&s;ed in Number and Strength, till in the end the <HI>Britains</HI> quite
<PB N="4" REF="8">
tir'd out, were glad to retire into the Moun|tainous and remote parts of the Land, (by which they kept them&s;elves for many Ages a people intirely di&s;tinct, and their Lan|guage to this very day unmixt; the Root of ours being evidently the <HI>Saxon,</HI> &s;o that the other mu&s;t needs be the Ancient <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>) and leave all the re&s;t to be &s;har'd among the new Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, who, there be|ing &s;o many Proprietors in the Conque&s;t, dealt out the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Monarchy into &s;even Parcels; which &s;evenfold Partition it may well be wondred how it could keep up &s;o long, con&s;idering the Confu&s;ions, and as it were Civil Wars, that aro&s;e (as how could they but ari&s;e) among &s;o many Petty Monarchs upon one Continent (that is, as to the bounds of each Kingdom) till at length one &s;wallowing up the other, the &s;tronger the weaker, this Seven-headed <HI>Hydra</HI> of Government came to a Period, and one bright face of Monarchy &s;hot up again, and &s;pread its Lu&s;tre over all this better part of <HI>Britain,</HI> which hath ever &s;ince been called the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and hath &s;o continued, with little or no Interruption, from the Raign of the Great <HI>Egbert.</HI> He it was who fir&s;t reduc'd this Heptarchy into a Perfect Monarchy, though it was tending toward it &s;ometime
<PB N="5" REF="8">
before, even to this day; and from him the <HI>Aera</HI> of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Monarchies by Hi&s;torians and Chronologers are reputed to commence: So that from the &s;aid <HI>Eg|bert,</HI> his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty that now Happily Reigns, is reckon'd the fourty &s;ixth &s;ole Monarch of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;carce was this Government well &s;etled, when the expected Tranquility thereof was di&s;turbed by a new Generation of Invaders, more Barbarous and Mi&s;chiev|ous, than ever any either before or &s;ince; Committers of far greater Outrages and Cruelties: Yet &s;o often either driven out, or totally extirpated; &s;o often bravely Conquered in the Field by the high Va|lour and Conduct of &s;everal of our <HI>Engli&s;h Saxon</HI> Monarchs (who&s;e Fame &s;tands great in Hi&s;tory to this day for their Vertue and Gallantry, both in Peace and War) that it may well be wondred, how any one Coun|try could &s;pare &s;uch Multitudes of People, as continually pour'd in upon us for &s;e|veral Ages together; and how &s;uch nu|merous Forces could make &s;uch frequent Landings with &s;o little Oppo&s;ition: But then it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that we had no <HI>Summer</HI> Guards Abroad, no Squadrons of Fir&s;t, Second and Third Rate Frigats to Crui&s;e about and Guard the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coa&s;ts;
<PB N="6" REF="9">
what kind of Ships there were in tho&s;e either for War or Trade, cannot be col|lected from any Account or De&s;cription we find recorded or publi&s;h'd; but thus much may well be concluded, that the be&s;t Man of War of tho&s;e times was far Inferior to the meane&s;t Merchant-Man now adays. For the &s;pace of about 174 years, <HI>viz.</HI> from 833, to 1017. was this poor King|dom harra&s;s'd by the continual Inva&s;ions of the&s;e <HI>Northern</HI> Pirates; yet could they not in all this &s;pace catch hold of the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> till the &s;aid year 1017. and then they held it no longer than du|ring the Reign of three Kings; after which it reverted again to the <HI>Saxon</HI> Line.</P>
<P>The Fourth and la&s;t Inva&s;ion was that of the <HI>Normans,</HI> if he can properly be call'd an Invader, who &s;eems to have come in with the Con&s;ent, at lea&s;t if not Invitation of &s;everal of the Nobility and Prelacy; for el&s;e doubtle&s;s his claim could not have been &s;o ea&s;ily decided by the dint of one Battle, and he &s;o readily have had the Crown put on his Head by <HI>Aldred</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>York,</HI> who with &s;everal other Bi&s;hops and Noble|men, met him upon the way, and pay'd him their Allegiance; and from this <HI>Nor|man</HI> Conqueror the Monarchy of <HI>England</HI> hath been kept up in a continued, though
<PB N="7" REF="9">
not Lineal Succe&s;&s;ion to this day. Among the Prae-eminences which this Kingdom hath above all the other Kingdoms of <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> the chiefe&s;t and which mo&s;t redounds to its Glory, is, that it was fir&s;t Enlightned with the Knowledge of True Religion; &s;o that what&s;oever place it may claim in <HI>Europe,</HI> it de&s;erves at lea&s;t to be e&s;teemed the fir&s;t Kingdom of <HI>Chri&s;tendom</HI>: And admit that <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> of <HI>Arimathea</HI> were not the fir&s;t that Preached the Go&s;pel here, though there are not wanting Te&s;timonies, to make it out, not altogether contemp|tible: However, it is mo&s;t certain, that the Chri&s;tian Religion here, is of a much elder date, than the coming over of <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> the Monk; that is, even in the very Apo&s;tles time, by the Te&s;timony of <HI>Gildas</HI>; and as it appears by the mention of a Noble <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Lady, <HI>Claudia Rufina,</HI> in one of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epi&s;tles; and it was not much above 100 years after e're it was own'd by publick Authority: For the fir&s;t Chri|&s;tian King mention'd in Hi&s;tory, is our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> King <HI>Lucius,</HI> who was Contempo|rary with the Emperor <HI>Commodus,</HI> al&s;o the fir&s;t Chri&s;tian Emperor, at lea&s;t the fir&s;t that publickly Profe&s;s'd, Protected and Maintain'd the Chri&s;tian Faith, (for before him <HI>Philippus Arabs</HI> is &s;aid to have been a
<PB N="8" REF="10">
a Chri&s;tian, and Baptiz'd) was <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> Surnamed the Great, a <HI>Britain</HI> Born, the Son of <HI>Con&s;tantius Chlorus</HI> (who al&s;o was a Favourer of the Chri&s;tians, and died at <HI>York</HI>) by the Daughter of King <HI>Coilus He|lena</HI> (a Prince&s;s mo&s;t renowned for her Chri&s;tian Piety, and for being the Inven|tre&s;s of the Cro&s;s. And as this Nation boa&s;ts Antiquity equal with <HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elf, for the Dawning of the Go&s;pel's Light among us, &s;o it claims a Prerogative of Lighting the fir&s;t Lamp of Reformation to the Chri&s;tian World; and highly glories in this, that there is no where to be found &s;o excellent and moderate an E&s;tabli&s;hment of Church-Government among all the Re|formed Churches.</P>

<HEAD>The Riches of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Nation.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">And fir&s;t of the Arable Pa&s;ture and Fruitage.</HEAD>
<P>THe Riches of any Nation, I mean the Native and Inland Riches, (for by Imported Commodities, the Barrene&s;t Na|tion in the World may be Rich,) con&s;i&s;t chiefly in the Arable, the Pa&s;turage, the Fruits, and other Plants of peculiar U&s;e and Advantage. The Rich Veins of Earth for Mettals and other &s;orts of Minerals, and the Plenty of Fi&s;h and Fowl; all which things are both profitable in them|&s;elves, and for the Manufactures they produce; and though common to this Na|tion, with the greate&s;t part of the Earth in general, yet it will not be from the pur|po&s;e to di&s;cover how far the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nati|on excels in each of them, and what parts of the Nation are mo&s;t peculiarly fam'd and commended for this or that Producti|on. As to the Arable, it would be in vain to particularize any one part of <HI>England</HI> more
<PB N="10" REF="11">
than another, &s;ince &s;o great Plenty of all &s;orts of Corn and Grain is produced in all parts of this Nation. Neverthele&s;s, it is worth the ob&s;erving, how &s;ome Counties are more peculiarly celebrated for this or that Grain: I have heard it affirm'd, that the very be&s;t Wheat in <HI>England</HI> is from a Vale near <HI>He&s;&s;en</HI> in <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> lying <HI>South|ward</HI> of <HI>Harrow on the Hill</HI>; however a|mong the four W's of <HI>Hereford&s;hire,</HI> Wheat is one, the other three being Wool, Wood and Water. Moreover for <HI>Oates,</HI> if there be any where one &s;ort better than another, the be&s;t Oats are &s;aid to be in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and in greater abundance than any other County; and for Barly and Malt, <HI>Bedford|&s;hire</HI> hath among &s;ome a particular men|tion. Moreover, for what is &s;aid in gene|ral of &s;ome places above others: It is &s;uf|ficiently con&s;iderable which is reported of the Town of <HI>Godmanche&s;ter</HI> in <HI>Huntington|&s;hire,</HI> in reference to the great Name that Town hath for Tillage, and its Prae-emi|nence above all the Towns of <HI>England</HI>; be&s;ides for number of Stout and Able Husbandmen, namely that the Inhabi|tans of this Place us'd in former times to meet the Kings of <HI>England</HI> as they pa&s;s'd this way in their Progre&s;s, in a kind of Ru|ral Pomp and Pageantry of &s;how, with no

fewer than 180 Ploughs; and in this manner King <HI>James</HI> at his fir&s;t coming to the Crown of <HI>England</HI> was received in his Journey from <HI>Scotland,</HI> with 70 Team of Hor&s;es, fitted with all their Furniture to as many New Ploughs; the King expre&s;|&s;ing much Delight and Satisfaction at &s;o Brave and Happy a Sight, and highly ap|plauded the Indu&s;try and well de&s;erved Pro&s;perity of the people of that Place. Remarkable al&s;o is the Vale of <HI>Eve&s;ham</HI> in <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> &s;o called of one <HI>Eoves</HI> a Swinheard to <HI>Egwin</HI> Bi&s;hop of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> &s;o Renowned for its Fertility and excellent kind of Corn it yields, that it is called the Granary of tho&s;e parts. The Vale of <HI>Alisbury</HI> in <HI>Buckingham&s;hire,</HI> is al&s;o parti|cularly taken notice of for its Plea&s;ant Meadows and Rich Pa&s;tures. Nor are the Sheep-Pa&s;tures near <HI>Knetworth</HI> in <HI>Hart|ford&s;hire,</HI> which is called the Garden of <HI>England,</HI> to be forgotten. <HI>Portholm</HI> Mea|dow al&s;o in <HI>Huntington&s;hire</HI> is reckon'd among the <HI>Notabilia</HI> of that County. The like may be &s;aid in a great mea&s;ure of the Pa&s;turage: However there are &s;ome places &s;o peculiarly remark'd either for the Large|ne&s;s or Richne&s;s of their Pa&s;tures, that the mention of them cannot well be omitted. The I&s;le of <HI>Shepey</HI> in <HI>Kent</HI> being about 21
<PB N="12" REF="12">
Miles in compa&s;s, is without que&s;tion &s;o denominated from the numerous Flocks of Sheep which it feedeth. No le&s;s celebra|ted is <HI>Rumny-Mar&s;h,</HI> heretofore a part of the Sea, under the Name of <HI>Romanum Mare,</HI> which by common Speech is ea&s;ily corrupted into <HI>Rumnen&s;e Mar&s;hium:</HI> Of this <HI>Mar&s;h, Twine</HI> in his Commentary, <HI>De rebus Anglicis,</HI> making a particular men|tion, thus concludes, <HI>Denique unde tot pingues peeudes,</HI> &amp;c.

After the Wool of <HI>Lem&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Cot&s;wold,</HI> that of the <HI>I&s;le of Wight</HI> comes next in e&s;timation. Be&s;ides tho&s;e places above-mentioned, there is one more, which for its largene&s;s and Fruitfulne&s;s alike, is worthy to be men|tioned, <HI>viz.</HI> The Vale of the <HI>Whitehor&s;e,</HI> which is partly in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> and partly in <HI>Bark&s;hire.</HI> For Fruit, there is &s;carce any County in <HI>England</HI> that is not tolerably well &s;tor'd in one &s;ort or other; but above all for Cherries, and now of late for Pip|pins, <HI>Kent</HI> bears the Name; and parti|cularly

<HI>Tenham,</HI> which is commonly &s;tyl'd the Parent of Fruit Gardens: But the fir&s;t Pippins brought over, that is about 100 years &s;ince, were Planted in that part of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire</HI> called <HI>Holland</HI>; and about <HI>Kirton</HI> in the &s;ame Shire: Nor are our Cherries of much longer date, being fir&s;t brought over from <HI>Flanders</HI> in the Reign of King <HI>Henry</HI> the Eight, and Planted in <HI>Kent,</HI> with that Succe&s;s, that one only Orchard of but 32 Acnes, is &s;aid to have produced in one year, as much as yielded 1000 <HI>l.</HI> For all &s;orts of Apples and Pears, and for great quantity of ex|cellent Syder, which furni&s;h <HI>London</HI> and many other parts, <HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire, Gloce&s;ter|&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Hereford&s;hire,</HI> are the principal Counties.</P>

Near <HI>Kenet</HI> in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> the water breaking but of certain &s;tones, is accounted a &s;ign of Dearth. The River <HI>Can</HI> in <HI>We&s;tmor|land</HI> hath Cataracts, which by their fall foretell either Rain or fair Weather. The ri&s;ing of a Bourn near <HI>Croiden</HI> in <HI>Surry,</HI>

<P>Nor is the new built Church of S^t <HI>Cle|ments</HI> to be wholly pa&s;s'd by, as exceeding much, both for the outward and inward Workman&s;hip, and particularly the fine Fret-work on the Cieling.</P>

<P>And fir&s;t, They are remarkable for num|ber, as being reckon'd in all 875.</P>
<P>In the next place, They plead prece|dence in the generality with all others in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Prime is <HI>London</HI>-Bridge, which is &s;aid to have been anciently built of Wood, and was then accounted a very &s;tately
<PB N="138" REF="75">
Bridge; but afterwards receiv'd a far grea|ter pitch of lu&s;tre by being built of Stone, in&s;omuch that without controver&s;ie it is judg'd the noble&s;t Structure of that kind in <HI>Europe.</HI> It &s;tands upon 19 Arches of Stone, which &s;upport a Street of very fair Edifices, of a quarter of a Mile in length, for &s;o much the breadth of the <HI>Thames</HI> is account|ed in that place.</P>
<P>The next for Beauty and Magnificence, is that of <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>; and after that the Bridg of <HI>Stratford upon Avon.</HI></P>
<P>Among the three Beauties of the Town of <HI>Lanca&s;ter,</HI> the Bridge is one, the other two being the Church and Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Over the River <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> which encircles the Town of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> all but the North-&s;ide, are three fair Bridges of Stone.</P>
<P>The &s;ame River <HI>Ou&s;e</HI> runs through the mid&s;t of the Town of <HI>Bedford,</HI> and hath over it a hand&s;om Stone-Bridge, with two Gates upon it.</P>
<P>Over the River <HI>Dee</HI> is a &s;tately Stone-Bridge, which leads to the City of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> It is &s;upported with 8 Arches, and hath at
<PB N="139" REF="75">
each end two &s;trong Gates, from whence the Walls commence, within which the City lyes in an oblong Square.</P>
<P>From the River <HI>Derwent,</HI> a &s;mall Brook runs through the Town of <HI>Darby,</HI> (which lyes on the We&s;tern-bank of that River) under 9 Bridges. But the &s;tatelie&s;t of all is that in the North-Ea&s;t part of the Town, upon which &s;tandeth a fair Chappel of Stone.</P>
<P>Over the River <HI>VVeer,</HI> with which the City of <HI>Durham</HI> is almo&s;t wholly incom|pa&s;s'd, two neat Stone-Bridges, one from the South, the other from the North-Road, lead into the mid&s;t of the Town.</P>
<P>The Bridge leading into <HI>VVarwick</HI>-Town, over the River <HI>Avon,</HI> is both &s;ight|ly and &s;trong.</P>
<P>But particularly &s;umptuous with their Towers and Gates, are tho&s;e two over <HI>Se|vern,</HI> at the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Entrances of <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI></P>
<P>That over the River <HI>Ou&s;e</HI> at <HI>York,</HI> which &s;tands on each &s;ide the River, hath one Arch, the large&s;t and loftie&s;t of any Bridge in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="76">Several others there are, and &s;ome per|haps not unworthy of memory, but the&s;e being the very chiefe&s;t, it will not be worth the while to mention any more.</P>
<P>The grand Ornaments of any City are the publick Buildings thereof; and next to the Churches, Palaces and Bridges, are the Monumental Structures, that pre&s;ent them|&s;elves mo&s;t obviou&s;ly to the view of Pa&s;&s;en|gers in Streets and High-ways, as Aque|ducts, Arches, and the Columnal or Image|ry-Works, erected as Trophies in memory of &s;ome great Action or Per&s;on; as al&s;o Pla|ces for publick Games and Spectacles.</P>
<P>For Structures of this kind, never any City of the World was &s;o famous as old <HI>Rome,</HI> who&s;e Circus's, Amphitheaters, Co|lumns, Pyramids, Tryumphal Arches, Eque|&s;trian Statues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> next to the ma&s;&s;ie Pyra|mids of <HI>Egypt,</HI> were accounted the greate&s;t Pieces of Art and Magnificence the World ever &s;aw. Nor are the Pyramids, Columns and Aguglia's of the pre&s;ent <HI>Rome,</HI> altoge|ther unmemorable.</P>
<P>Of Monuments of this nature in <HI>England,</HI> the Cro&s;&s;es erected in Streets and publick Places were the chief. And of tho&s;e the
<PB N="141" REF="76">
principal were <HI>Coventry</HI>-Cro&s;s; and in this City <HI>Charing</HI>-Cro&s;s, and that of <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> which la&s;t was certainly the noble&s;t Piece of Workman&s;hip of this nature, as well for the largene&s;s as the curiou&s;ne&s;s of the Ima|gery that ever was &s;een.</P>
<P>Next, The Aqueducts or Conduits have been accounted no &s;mall Street-ornaments in many Towns and Cities, but the men|tion of tho&s;e that were in <HI>London,</HI> may &s;erve for all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The chief that were in <HI>London</HI> before the Fire of 66. were the Standart in <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> a Structure that might have pa&s;s'd for a no|ble Piece of Workman&s;hip, had it not &s;tood &s;o near &s;o rich a Cro&s;s. Another at the lower end of <HI>Cheap&s;ide.</HI> Another in <HI>Corn|hil.</HI> That in <HI>Fleet&s;treet,</HI> hard by <HI>Shoe-lane</HI> end; and another in <HI>Holborn,</HI> near <HI>Holborn</HI>-Bridge, be&s;ides &s;everal others of le&s;s Note. The only Conduit lately erected, now &s;tanding, is a pretty little Structure be|tween <HI>Cow-lane</HI> and <HI>Snow-hill.</HI></P>
<P>Since the Fire, other kind of Monuments have been rais'd, which add not a little to the Ornament of the City in general, and give peculiar Grace to the Places where they
<PB N="142" REF="77" MS="y">
&s;tand. The chief whereof is the Monu|ment erected where the Fire began, a Py|ramid of &s;tately heighth and curious Work|man&s;hip.</P>
<P>Another Monument much of the &s;ame nature is de&s;ign'd, and the Edifice rais'd &s;ome yards above the ground, at the lower end of <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> at or very near the Place where the Conduit formerly &s;tood: A ve|ry rare De&s;ign, as appears by the Model which I have often &s;een at the Hou&s;e of the ingenious De&s;igner thereof, M^r <HI>Ja&s;per La|tham,</HI> the City-Ma&s;on.</P>
<P>At the <HI>Stocks-Market</HI> is an Eque&s;trian Statue in Stone of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>And another more excellent than that in Bra&s;s, of his late Maje&s;ty of happy Memory, in the Place where <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s</HI> &s;tood.</P>
<P>In <HI>Covent-Garden</HI> Square is a Columnal-Dial, which only wants &s;omewhat of Mag|nitude to make it a very graceful Ornament to the Place.</P>
<P>Our Theaters at pre&s;ent are only two, That of his Maje&s;ty's Servants, between <HI>Bridges-&s;treet</HI> and <HI>Drury-lane</HI>; and that of
<PB N="143" REF="77">
his Royal Highne&s;s's Servants, in <HI>Salisbury-&s;treet,</HI> with a maje&s;tick Front towards the <HI>Thames</HI> &s;ide.</P>
<P>Artificial publick Bagno's have not been known in <HI>England</HI> till of late: The only one yet built is a&s;ide of <HI>Newgate-&s;treet,</HI> a pretty well contriv'd Piece of Building, had it been more publickly expos'd to view on the Street &s;ide.</P>
<P>The Gates of Towns and Cities are not the lea&s;t of Ornaments to the &s;aid Towns and Cities. Of the chief of them, except tho&s;e in <HI>London,</HI> we have toucht in the re|&s;pective Places to which they belong. The principal Gates of <HI>London</HI> are <HI>Ludgate, New|gate, Alder&s;gate, Algate, Bi&s;hop&s;gate</HI> and <HI>Tem|ple-bar</HI>; and the two Gates at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> between <HI>Whitehal</HI> and <HI>Kings-&s;treet,</HI> mo&s;t of them not inferior in Magnificence to the chief in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>But to clo&s;e all that hath been &s;aid of publick Ornaments, there remains one thing more, not to be neglected by any Admirer of Art, which is a Piece of Sculp|ture in Stone, repre&s;enting the Re&s;urrecti|on, over a Gate in <HI>Shoo-lane,</HI> that gives en|trance

<P>THE Monument of Stones at <HI>Stanton Drew,</HI> near <HI>Pensford,</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> de&s;erves a particular de&s;cription, but much more that of <HI>Aubury</HI> in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> about four Miles We&s;t from <HI>Marleborough.</HI> About this Village is ca&s;t a Ditch of a prodigious depth; <HI>viz.</HI> as deep as that of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> which is the deepe&s;t that hath been ob&s;er|ved: and, not without (as u&s;ually) but within this Ditch is rai&s;ed a very high Bank, or Trench, not in a form ab&s;olutely Circular, but &s;omewhat near. Within the Trench, and an&s;werable to the form thereof, Stones are &s;et round, excepting tho&s;e Gaps which appear to have been made by the Inva&s;ion of the Villagers upon the&s;e Stones, with Sledges, for their u&s;e in Building.

<P>In the tenth year of the &s;aid Queen, <HI>Ri|chard Dyer</HI> came from <HI>Spain,</HI> and taught his Country-men the way of making Earthen Fire-Pots, Furnaces and Tran&s;portable Ovens for baking of Earthen Ware. He had the fir&s;t &s;ole profit by Patent, <HI>Anno</HI> 1555.</P>
<P><HI>Walter Rippon</HI> is &s;aid to have made the fir&s;t Coach in <HI>England</HI>: for the Earl of <HI>Rut|land, Anno</HI> 1564. a hollow turning Coach: for the Queen: <HI>Anno</HI> 1585. a rare Chariot.</P>

<P><HI>William Matthews,</HI> in the 5th of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> was the fir&s;t rare Arti&s;t in the making of fine Knives and Hafts, which were marked with a Half Moon; and for which he had the Queens Letters Patents.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time Pins, which were formerly brought in by Strangers, to the value of 60000 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> were fir&s;t made in <HI>England</HI>; and now excell all that are made in any other part of the World.</P>

<P>An Engin for Clock-Wheels was inven|ted about a hundred years &s;ince. An En|gine for the &s;peedy cutting down of Wheels for Watches, forty years ago, none now made after the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>An Engin for drawing of Pinion Wire, of Steel for Watches, about ten years ago.</P>

For tho the Poor be never &s;o indu&s;trious, yet wanting what to Trade with, their Indu|&s;try will faint; but if they have imploy|ment to improve them&s;elves, Lands, and all things el&s;e will be improved, and ad|vanced to a higher E&s;timate, and the growth of <HI>England</HI> be made of value equal, if not exceeding any <HI>European</HI> Commodity what|&s;oever: So that this &s;pot of an I&s;land may, nay is, rightly termed the Store-Hou&s;e of the World, who can &s;ub&s;i&s;t of her &s;elf, but without who&s;e Commodities few Na|tions

<P>But to the purpo&s;e: The Kings after the Conque&s;t intending to make this their con&s;tant Seat, and making little e&s;teem of their Ancient Inheritance, the Dutchy of <HI>Normandy</HI> did not let to increa&s;e the Gran|dure of this Kingdom, by granting large Pri|viledges and immunities to tho&s;e that were Indu&s;trious, but e&s;pecially to the City of <HI>London,</HI> the chief re&s;idence of Royalty, named by many Kings, their Royal Cham|ber: Nor was any thing thought too dear that might conduce to her Felicity, as ap|pears by the Charter granted by King <HI>William</HI> the fir&s;t, commonly called the Con|queror, which was in the&s;e words.</P>
<P>William <HI>King, greeteth</HI> William <HI>Bi&s;hop, and</HI> Godfry Porters <HI>and all the Burge&s;&s;es within</HI> London, French, <HI>and</HI> Engli&s;h, <HI>and I grant you, that I will that you maintain and injoy all your Laws, that you did in the days of King</HI> Edward (meaning the Confe&s;&s;or<HI>'s) and I will, that each Child be his Fathers Heir; and further, I will, that no man wrong you, and &s;o God keep you.</HI></P>
<P>This free conce&s;&s;ion gave &s;cope to Trade, being much augmented by &s;ucceeding Kings, &s;o that Trad&s;emen growing numerous, they &s;o prevailed upon the Benign Boun|ty of the Reigning Princes, that they af|ter

<P>THe u&s;ual Weights that pa&s;s through|out <HI>England,</HI> are Troy Weight, and Averdupois-Weights; the former con&s;i&s;ting of twelve Ounces, each Ounce to con&s;i&s;t of twenty Penny Weight, the Penny Weight to con&s;i&s;t or twenty four Grains; and this Weight is commonly u&s;ed in Weighing of Bread, Gold, Silver; all Phy&s;ical matters, as Electuaries, Powders, and the like; eight pounds of this Weight being reckoned to Weigh a Gallon, and from thence Multi|plyed to any greater Mea&s;ure; four Gal|lons making a Peck, four Pecks a Bu&s;hel, and  <GAP DESC="blank">  Bu&s;hels a Quarter. Wet Mea|&s;ures are likewi&s;e derived from this Weight, both at Land and Sea, <HI>viz.</HI> twelve Troy Ounces is a Pint of Liquids, eight Pints a Gallon; which of either Wine, Beer,
<PB N="39" REF="166">
or Ale, is eight pounds Troy, according to the Standard of the Exchequer, and Acts of Parliament of the XI. and XII. of <HI>Hen|ry</HI> the &s;eventh. And by this Rule the Coop|ers make their Casks for all vendible A&s;|&s;ize, <HI>vix.</HI> a Hog&s;head to contain &s;ixty three Gallons, a Tearce eighty four, a Pipe one hundred twenty &s;ix, a Tun two hundred fifty two Gallons; as likewi&s;e all Casks made for packing up Fi&s;h, as a Salmon Butt to contain eighty four Gallons, the Barrel twenty four, a Herring Barrel thirty two, an Eele Barrel forty two, a Sope Barrel thirty two Gallons, the le&s;&s;er Casks to be divided accordingly.</P>
<P>The other Weight, <HI>viz.</HI> Averdupois, wherewith is Weighed Butter, Chee&s;e, Fle&s;h, Wax, all manner of Grocery, and indeed mo&s;t Commodities vended in <HI>England</HI>; it con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ixteen Ounces to the pound, and is called Garbel, by Rea&s;on a Draught or Wa&s;t is allowed to every weighing: Seven pound of this Weight is accounted to weigh a Gallon of Wheat, and &s;o Multi|plyed to fifty &s;ix pound the Bu&s;hel; &s;even pound Averdupois, is one hundred and two Ounces of Troy; from whence it is accounted that a Bu&s;hel of Wheat mu&s;t weigh one hundred and twelve pound, and a quarter four hundred forty eight pounds
<PB N="40" REF="167">
Averdupois, and &s;o con&s;equently fourteen pound Averdupois is &s;ixteen pound eleven Ounces Troy; and as one penny Sterling is the twentieth part of an Ounce Troy, &s;o &s;even pound twelve Shillings Sterling is eighty four Ounces, a half and two penny Weight of Troy, and &s;ix pound eight Shil|lings Sterling, is eighty two pound &frac34; Ounce, and one penny Weight; and from the&s;e two are the Weights of Hou&s;hold, Wheat|en and White Bread Calculated.</P>
<P>The Weigh of Chee&s;e is by Averdupois, and runs thus. The Weigh of Chee&s;e one hundred and twelve pound Averdupois, and the two hundred containing two hundred twenty four pounds, con&s;i&s;ts of thirty four Cloves, every Clove being &s;even pound. The Weigh of Suffolk Chee&s;e is two hun|dred fifty &s;ix, and the Weigh of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> Chee&s;e three hundred thirty &s;ix pound A|verdupois.</P>
<P>A Sack of Wool was accounted three hundred fifty four pound Averdupois: two Weighs of Wool make a Sack, and two Sacks a La&s;t.</P>

<PB N="41" REF="167">
one hundred and twelve <HI>per cent.</HI> Averdu|pois. This Weight likewi&s;e of &s;ixteen Ounces to the pound is made three &s;everal Quintars for Weighing &s;everal &s;orts of Merchandi&s;e; the fir&s;t is of five&s;core pound ju&s;t to the hundred, and called one hun|dred Sutle, whereby fine Commodities as Spices, Drugs, and the like are &s;old, which are accounted by the pound, and to which over and above is allowed by the Seller four pound, upon one hundred and four pound taken from the overplus, derived from the Weights of <HI>Antwerp</HI> for Spices, and called by the name of <HI>Tret.</HI> The &s;econd of the Quintars is one hundred and twelve, <HI>viz,</HI> five&s;core and twelve to the hundred, by which all Gro&s;s Commodities are weighed.</P>
<P>The third is &s;ix&s;core to the hundred, by which Tinn is weighed to his Maje&s;ties Farmers, and &s;ome other few Commodi|ties; and is called by the name of the <HI>Stan|nery</HI> hundred. From this Averdupois Weight, by divi&s;ion the Weight called the Stone, which is twofold, the long, and the &s;hort; the long is accounted four pounds Averdupois, and the &s;hort eight, but in this there is no certainty, for it differs accord|ing to the Cu&s;toms of Counties and Markets. There is an other thing in u&s;e called a <HI>Tod,</HI> &s;ome places &s;even pound,
<PB N="42" REF="168">
others eight, and &s;ome again ten, being altogether variable. They have likewi&s;e a Clove of twenty pound, twenty eight pound, thirty two pound, and the like. There are likewi&s;e in mo&s;t Markets for weigh|ing of Fle&s;h Stillyards u&s;ed, but without the Approbation of the Buyers; they being unin|telligible to many, and oftentimes fal&s;e; fir&s;t invented for the Weighing Hay, and Straw, for which u&s;es indeed they are only proper.</P>
<P>Averdupois con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ixteen Ounces, every Ounce con&s;i&s;ting of eight Drams, and every Dram of &s;ixty Grains; &s;o that by it the Raw-Silk of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Turky,</HI> are &s;old, but then twenty four Ounces are allowed to the pound, or a pound and an half, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<PB N="54" REF="174">
twenty &s;ix Yards. All &s;orts of Cloaths that are &s;ix quarters and a half wide, ought to weigh &s;ixty pound, and be twenty four and twenty &s;ix Yards in length; broad and narrow <HI>York&s;hire</HI> of four quarters wide, weigh thirty pound, and in length are twenty four, and twenty five Yards. Broad-Cloath of <HI>Taunton, Dun&s;table,</HI> and <HI>Bridg-Water</HI> of &s;even quarters, weigh thirty pound the Cloath, and in Mea&s;ure are twelve, and thirteen Yards. <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> Ker&s;ies, and Do&s;&s;ens of four quarters, weigh thirteen pounds, in Mea|&s;ure twelve, and thirteen Yards. Chequer Ker&s;ies, Grays, Striped and Plain of four quar|ters are in Weight twenty four pound, in Mea|&s;ure &s;eventeen, and eighteen Yards. Ordinary Peni&s;tons or Forre&s;ts of three quarters and a half, in Weight twenty eight pound, in Mea&s;ure twelve and thirteen Yards. Sort|ing Peni&s;ton of &s;ix quarters and a half are pounds thirty five, Yards thirteen and fourteen. Wa&s;hers of <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> and others the Cloaths are &s;eventeen pounds in Weight, in Mea&s;ure &s;eventeen and eighteen Yards. This Cu&s;tom of a&s;&s;izing Cloaths at a cer|tain Weight was fir&s;t impo&s;ed for the pre|venting defrauds in making &s;light &s;lea&s;y, or imperfect Cloaths, and if any of the afore&s;aid Cloaths prove otherwi&s;e then is &s;pecifyed,

the maker, or &s;eller, ought to allow accord|ing to the want, either in Width, Length, or Weight, and for &s;o refu&s;ing, may be &s;ued for a defraud.</P>
<P>To bring this to perfection the Weight of Wool is thus, the Sack of Wool doth contain three hundred &s;ixty four pounds, the Tod twenty eight pound, thirteen Tods being accounted to a Sack; every Tod being four Nales, and every Nail, &s;even pound: The Sack of Wool is imputed to fini&s;h four Standard Cloaths, of twenty four Yards each in length, &amp; &s;ix Yards &amp; half quar+ter wide, of &s;ixty pound Weight, commonly called Sorting Cloaths. In the Weight it is to be noted whether the Cloaths are thick Mill'd, well &s;coured, and throughly dryed, that the &s;ame be Mea&s;ured by the Yard, and that an Inch be allowed to every Yard: And thus much for Woollen Manufacture.</P>

<P><HI>Peru</HI> is for Gold, the riche&s;t Province of <HI>America</HI>: The Mines being more plentiful then Mines of Lead and Iron in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and the Riches thereof may be Con|jectured by this: When <HI>Pi&s;cario</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain &s;ubdued it, and took the King Pri|&s;oner, he propo&s;ed his Ran&s;om, and deli|vered to the treacherous <HI>Spaniard</HI> upon &s;o|lemn Promi&s;e for his Life and Liberty, as much refined Gold and Silver as amounted to ten Millions, but perfidious as he was, when he had Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Trea&s;ure not|with&s;tanding his Oath, he &s;lew him. The chief City is St. <HI>Michael</HI>'s, inhabited by the <HI>Spaniards</HI>; the Soyl brings forth all man|ner of Fruits, as likewi&s;e &s;tore of To|bacco; but one thing is more admirable, on the Banks of the River <HI>Riolaplata</HI> grow Figtrees, one &s;ide of which bear Figs in Winter, and the other in Summer, and this River is 130. miles over, and 2000. in length; and in it are many I&s;lands.</P>

<P>The manner of getting the Gold in the&s;e remote Parts of the World, are by Mining, or Wa&s;hing and Fi&s;hing; As thus, they fir&s;t &s;earch the ground, and finding it &s;tockt with Ore, they dig into the Mountains, and &s;till as they go under-prop, or Arch, &s;o that a Mine &s;ometimes is a Furlong under ground; their Earth they wa&s;h through Sieves, and the Mold &s;eparated, the Gold appears. Silver run in Veins or Sprigs, and therefore is got more ea&s;ily. As for the Fi&s;hing for Gold, it is thus: They turn the Cour&s;e of &s;mall Rivers or Brooks, at the bottom of the Golden Mountains; or with &s;uch things as take up Balla&s;t in the Thames, drag up the Sand, and then &s;ift it.

<P>As for Coyns they have none, the Trade among them&s;elves being for Gold-Sands, or Ingot by Weight, the finene&s;s of which they try with Artificial Needles, in number 24; in &s;ome Places they melt their Gold, and draw it into Wire, and &s;o cut into &s;mall pieces, the better to di|vide it as occa&s;ion requires, and in other places they have pieces of Iron, which goes Currant in&s;tead of Mony.</P>
<P>Their Weights con&s;i&s;t of Copper, the greate&s;t of which is a Benda, containing 2 Ounces Troy, a Benda offa, or half a Benda. The A&s;&s;eva which is two Pe&s;oes

The pound Troy of fine Gold is Accounted worth 36 pound, the Ounce 3 pound or if very fine &s;omething more, or again le&s;s as the Allay is, as thus: The Ounce of fine Gold is valued at 3 pound, 33 Kes fine at 2 pound 17 Shillings 6 pence, 22 Kes fine at 2 pound 15 Shillings, 21 Kes 2 pound 12 Shillings 6 pence; the Ounce of 20 Kes fine is worth but 2 pound 10 Shillings, and &s;o lo&s;ing value 2 Shillings 6 pence <HI>per</HI> Ounce, as it wants a Carot in finene&s;s in 24, or the Troy pound. Now to know the goodne&s;s or finene&s;s of Gold and Silver upon the Touch-Stone, by way of E&s;&s;ay, is to procure Needles of Gold and Silver, and Copper Allay &s;utable to any &s;ort of Gold and Silver in Allay, and to be of 4 &s;orts, <HI>viz.</HI> the fir&s;t of fine Gold and Silver, the &s;econd of Gold and Copper, the third of Gold Silver and Copper, and the fourth of Sil|ver and Copper only; the fir&s;t for the try|al of Gold, and the latter for Silver, and of the&s;e Mixtures make 24 Needles differing in finene&s;s from each, as thus; The fir&s;t mu&s;t be all fine Gold without any Allay, <HI>viz.</HI> 24 Carots, the &s;econd 23 Carots of fine

Gold and one of Silver, the third 22 Carots of Gold and 2 of Silver, and &s;o one Carot wor&s;e till there remains but one Carot of fine Gold in Mixture, with 23 Carots of Silver. And by this Rule the Gold and Copper, and Silver and Copper mu&s;t be Allayed; and each Needle marked of what finene&s;s it is. And by this means you may know the finene&s;s of any Ingot or Piece of Gold or Silver; as thus, touch the &s;aid In|got or Piece of Gold or Silver upon your Touch-Stone, and by it the Needle you think is neare&s;t it in finene&s;s; and if that &s;uit not with it, try another till it &s;uits with it, which when wet, will appear, and &s;o by the mark of your Needle, you may be a&s;&s;ured of the finene&s;s of the Silver or Gold &s;o touched, which is a better, ea&s;i|er, &s;afer, and &s;urer way then to try it by Fire.

then to know a good and true Diamond take this rule. A good and right Diamond is fa&s;t and no ways porous, &s;o that it will re|&s;i&s;t the Fire, and after &s;everal hours con|tinuance therein, come out bright as at fir&s;t; and in choice of &s;uch a one&punc; it mu&s;t be nei|ther Brown, Yellowi&s;h, Blewi&s;h, nor a Dulli&s;h-Black, but of a good Water-Chri|&s;taline; not wanting any corner when Po|li&s;hed on a Mill, nor be too thick nor too thinn, but &s;o as it may be &s;et firm, and to good advantage in a Ring, or Collet without being upholden by Velvet, and &s;uch a Diamond weighing 1 Carot is worth 35 pounds Sterling or upwards.</P>
<P>Note when you have found out the true value of a perfect Diamond or Diamonds, this Rule is to be ob&s;erved. Suppo&s;e a Dia|mond weighing a Carot Weight be worth 40 Ducats more or le&s;s, then the 4th. part being ten Ducats is the price of a Diamond weighing half a Carot, &s;o the Diamond weighing a Carot is worth but the 4th. part of the value of one weighing 2 Ca|rots, <HI>viz.</HI> 40 Ducats, and that weighing 2 Carots worth 160 Ducats; and &s;o if there be over Weight by Grains, you mu&s;t di|vide all into Grains, and then a Diamond weighing 3 Grains is worth but the 4th. part of that weighing 6. And this is a Ge|neral
<PB N="179" REF="237">
Rule, not only for Diamonds but all manner of precious Stones, according to Equality in goodne&s;s, as for Example a thick Table Diamond of the goodne&s;s a|fore&s;aid weighing 1 Grain is worth 1 pound 17 Shillings 6 pence, weighing 2 Grains is worth 7 pound 10 Shillings, weighing 3 Grains is worth 16 pound 17 Shillings 6 pence, weighing 1 Carot is worth 30 pound, and &s;o proportionably to 8 Carots, yet there are &s;ome Diamonds imperfect, and not of any Extraordinary value, which are called Brut Diamonds, Naifs, Rocks, and flat-Stones, which are bought and &s;old at uncertain rates.</P>
<P>The Ruby is found in <HI>Zeilam</HI> in <HI>India,</HI> and called commonly the Carbuncle, try|ed in the Fire to know its perfection, the which if it abide and come out Burning like a Cole and of a high Colour, it is Ac|counted perfect; a Stone of which perfecti|on weighing but one Carot or &frac12;, a Fanan is valued at 30 Fanans in <HI>Callicut,</HI> and in|crea&s;e in value as the Dimonds according to their Weight; there is another &s;ort on|ly called a Ruby, found in a River in the Kingdom of <HI>Pegu</HI>; but it will not indure the Fire, but loo&s;eth it's Colour&punc; when put to the Tryal; there are likewi&s;e &s;everal &s;orts of Rubies as the Carbuncle, Ballas,
<PB N="180" REF="238">
Spinal, Garnat, and Rubas; but this Ruby of <HI>Pegu</HI> is accounted the next in value to the Carbuncle, and a Ruby &s;quare table-wi&s;e, perfect, and of high Colour of 16.18.20. or 24. Carots in Colour, weigh|ing a Fanan is worth &s;ometimes in the <HI>In|dia</HI>'s, 100. Ducats, and in <HI>England</HI> weighing 11 &frac12; Carots, and of 20 Carots in Colour perfect and without Blemi&s;h, is worth 350 pound Sterling or rather more.</P>
<P>Saphyrs are found in <HI>Zeilam, Calucut, Ba|&s;inger, Canoner,</HI> and <HI>Pegu,</HI> and tho&s;e are accounted be&s;t that are of a pure Azure or Sky-Colour, and in that hardne&s;s excelleth all other Stones the Diamond excepted, and according to their Colour are held in E&s;ti|mation; as for example, Saphyr weigh|ing one Carot is worth 2 Fanans, one weighing 2 Carots is worth 5 Fanans, one weighing 3 worth 10 Fanans, and one weighing 4 Carots worth 15 Fanans, and &s;o Proportionably each Fanan being Ac|counted 2 Carots; after this manner Tur|quoi&s;e, Topaze, Berrils, Cry&s;olites, Jacynths, Amathi&s;ts, and other precious Stones are known and valued every one according to their goodne&s;s and Weight; as for Pearls, how they are taken, I have before &s;et down, and now I &s;hall as far as is nece&s;&s;ary make a report of their true value
<PB N="181" REF="238">
according as they are in goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Rule to value Oriental Pearls, from a Grain in Weight to what bigne&s;s any will afford, is by the Colour, Round|ne&s;s, Pear-Fa&s;hion, or Oval; and that is in all parts perfect, as to Water and Glo&s;s, without Knobs, Specks, Yellowne&s;s or other imperfections, and a Pearl of this perfection weighing a Carot is worth a Ducat in <HI>India.</HI> But before I proceed fur|ther, as to their value it will not be a|mi&s;s to relate how they are &s;old, by tho&s;e that have the di&s;po&s;ing of them, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;ell them by Sieves of Latten full of holes in number 12, one bigger then the other as to their holes, and according to the largene&s;s or &s;mallne&s;s, the price is re|gulated; for tho&s;e of the 10, 11, and 12 Sieve are &s;eldom capable to be holed, and therefore are called Seed-Pearls; mo&s;t fit for Apothecaries, to be u&s;ed by them in their Phy&s;ical Preparations; but the others for the u&s;e of Ladies, and others to adorn them&s;elves withal; and for the price of all large Pearls, they are valued as is &s;aid by Weight and fairne&s;s, as Diamonds and o|ther precious Stones, tho &s;eldom before they be holed for fear of their breaking in the holing; as thus, a Pearl of one Grain is worth 7 pence, of 2 Grains 2 Shillings
<PB N="182" REF="239">
6 pence, of 3 Grains 5 Shillings 7 pence, of 1 Carot 10 Shillings, and &s;o in pro|portion to tho&s;e of greater Weight, as for Seed-Pearls, the &s;malle&s;t of which are Ac|counted 4500. to the Ounce, and the larg|e&s;t 400 or 450 to the Ounce, and com|monly divided into 6 parts, the Prizes are the&s;e: The 6th. or &s;malle&s;t &s;ort 4500 are commonly &s;old for 2 pound 4 Shillings the Ounce, the 5th. &s;ort are &s;old for 1 pound 6 Shillings the Ounce, the 4th. &s;ort at 10 Shillings the Ounce, the third &s;ort at 18 Shillings the Ounce, the &s;econd at 1 pound 6 Shillings, and the fir&s;t at 1 pound 15 Shillings.

<P>The currant Coyn of this Kingdom is the Dollar, which is divided into 8 Marks, and each Mark into 2 Clippings, each Clipping being accounted 9 &frac12; Stivers Fle|mi&s;h, and in exchange the Dollar is only u&s;ed.</P>

<P>The Mea&s;ure of Length is the Ell, 166 of which are 100 Yards of <HI>London</HI> Mea&s;ure, &s;ometimes more &s;ometimes le&s;s; for this is the Rule, they take a Piece of Rope, and Mea&s;ure it by the bigne&s;s of a mans Head, which they call their Ell, &s;o that according to the largene&s;s or &s;mall|ne&s;s of the Head, by which they take their Mea&s;ure, the Mea&s;ure is found to con&s;i&s;t.</P>

<P><HI>Mo&s;co</HI> the <HI>Metropolis</HI> of <HI>Mo&s;covia,</HI> is Seated on the River <HI>Mo&s;ca,</HI> which falls in to <HI>Tanais</HI>; this City is reckoned 6 Miles in compa&s;s, and is for the mo&s;t part the imperial Seat, being much Beautifyed &s;ince it was Burnt by the <HI>Tartars,</HI> upon their invading the <HI>Mo&s;covite</HI> Empire; and here the Engli&s;h Merchants find kind enter|tainment, unle&s;s in Trouble&s;ome times, as of late it happened upon the murther of the <HI>Czar,</HI> in which general Calamity ma|ny &s;uffered in their Goods; but now things are again reduced to a quiet and &s;etled con|dition, &s;o that Trade again begins to Flo|ri&s;h, the Country affording great &s;tore of Furs, as Beaver, Otter, Sables, White, Black, Red, and Dun Fox-Skins, with many others of the like nature; which are &s;old by the Timber, Weight, or Tale, be|ing highly valued of late by the Natives, who perceiving the de&s;ire Merchants have for them, learn thereby to &s;et prices on them accordingly.</P>

Now there are &s;everal Cities that exchange in one and the &s;ame Monies, Coyns, and Denomination; as <HI>Naples, Lechie, Bar|ry,</HI> the two latter included in the former,
<PB N="289" REF="292">
<HI>Palermo,</HI> and <HI>Me&s;&s;ina,</HI> comprehended in <HI>Si|cilia; Valentia, Sarago&s;a,</HI> and <HI>Bar&s;elona</HI> in <HI>Cattalonia; Sevil, Alcala,</HI> and <HI>Medina-del-Campo</HI> in <HI>Ca&s;tilia; Frankford, Colona, Norem|burg,</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;ta</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> with many other of le&s;s note. But exchange now from a Plain and ea&s;ie Method is reduced to &s;o many my&s;terious Points, that it is extraor|dinary difficult to under&s;tand it aright in all places, therefore I &s;hall only lay down &s;uch Particulars as chiefly concern Engli&s;h Merchants; and are conducing to the Trade of the Britti&s;h Empire. The fir&s;t thing then that is to be ob&s;erved, is the true value of the Coyn of the City, or Port where you make your exchange, which is not to be taken according to the value of the Coyn as it is currant, but according to its Weight and finene&s;s, and &s;o the return may be proportionable; but if Bills are drawn to pay a Merchant re&s;iding in any place where the Coyn is currant, and he di&s;po|&s;es of it for Commodities of the Growth, or Manufacture of the Country, then it matters not how the Coyn has been in|haunced above its true value, by Rea&s;on it is currant, tho perhaps &s;hould the Coyn be carryed into an other Kingdom, it might redound to the lo&s;s of the receiver a third part; and this equallizing Coyns of divers
<PB N="290" REF="293">
Nations by Ballance I called a Par, by which all Coyns of Silver or Gold e&s;pe|cially, are reduced to an equal value; as for example, <HI>Placentia</HI> exchanges with <HI>Lon|don</HI> one Crown of currant money there for 1 Shilling 6 pence &frac12; <HI>ob.</HI> Sterling, <HI>Lyons</HI> the Crown currant for 2 Shillings 8 pence Sterling, <HI>Rome</HI> exchanges her Ducat 87 &frac12; pence Sterling, <HI>Genoa</HI> her Crown of Gold at 83 pence Sterling, <HI>Millain</HI> her Crown of Gold 84 pence &frac12; <HI>ob.</HI> Sterling, <HI>Venice</HI> her Ducat at 60 pence Sterling, <HI>Florence</HI> her Crown at 80 pence, <HI>Luca</HI> her Ducat at 67 pence Sterling, <HI>Naples</HI> her Ducat at 66 &frac12; pence Sterling, <HI>Lechy</HI> her Ducat at 6 pence Sterling, <HI>Bary</HI> her Ducat at 62 pence Ster|ling, <HI>Palermo</HI> her Ducat at 78 pence Ster|ling, <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> her Ducat at 72 pence Ster|ling, <HI>Valentia</HI> her Ducat at 72 &frac12; pence Ster|ling, <HI>Sarago&s;a</HI> her Ducat at 73 pence Ster|ling, <HI>Bar&s;alonia</HI> her Ducat at 72 pence Ster|ling, <HI>Sevil</HI> her Ducat at 72 pence Ster|ling, <HI>Lisbon</HI> her Ducat at 69 pence Ster|ling, <HI>Bolonia</HI> her Ducat at 67 pence Ster|ling, <HI>Bergamo</HI> her Ducaton at 67 pence Ster|ling, <HI>Frankfort, Noremburg, Augu&s;ta,</HI> and <HI>Viena</HI> (in all which Cities one and the &s;ame Coyn is currant) Exchange their Florin at 50 pence Sterling; all the&s;e Cities and Towns <HI>London</HI> exchanges within broken numbers

<P>Again in <HI>London</HI> and throughout all <HI>Eng|land</HI> Exchangers and Merchants keep their Accounts in Pounds, Shillings, Pence, and ca&s;t them up as is done in other places, by Solds, Livers, and Denire, <HI>viz.</HI> 12 pence to the Shilling, and 20 Shillings to the pound, and are found to exchange with <HI>Tran&s;marine</HI> Cities thus, <HI>viz.</HI> to allow 64 pence Sterling, for the Crown of <HI>Placentia</HI> 64 pence Sterling, for the Crown of <HI>Ly|ons</HI> 66 pence Sterling, for the Ducat of <HI>Rome</HI> 65 pence, for the Crown of Gold of <HI>Genoa</HI> 64 2/4 pence, for the Crown of Gold of <HI>Millain</HI> 50 pence, for the Ducat in <HI>Ban|co</HI> of <HI>Venice</HI> 61 pence, for the Crown of <HI>Florence</HI> 53 &frac12; pence, for the Ducaton of <HI>Luca</HI> 50 pence, for the Ducat of <HI>Naples</HI> 50 &frac12; pence, for the Ducat of <HI>Lechy</HI> 51 pence, for the Ducat of <HI>Bary</HI> 57 &frac12;, for the Du|cat of <HI>Palermo</HI> 56 &frac12;, for which Ducat of <HI>Me&s;&s;ina</HI> one pound Sterling, for 34 &frac12; Shil|lings Flemi&s;h, with <HI>Antwerp</HI> and <HI>Collon</HI> 57 &frac12; pence, for the Ducat of <HI>Valentia</HI> 59

<P>The Terms of paying Bills of exchange in <HI>London</HI> with other Cities, are commonly the&s;e.

<P>A Bill of Exchange in it &s;elf is held &s;o excellent a &s;peciallity, and carries with it not only as it were a command|ing Power to pay; but is for the mo&s;t part ob|&s;erved and &s;atisfyed with all due regard, tho drawn by a Servant upon his Ma&s;ter, &s;uch a high e&s;teem being ever had for the quality thereof, that nothing in the way of Trade can be more, for upon it depends the reputation of the Drawer &amp; Accepter: So that tho&s;e who fail in the payment of accepted Bills, wound their credit by &s;uffering Pro|te&s;t to be made, which &s;oon gets Wind

<P>Of bills of exchange there are two &s;orts, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and Inland, <HI>viz.</HI> the former drawn upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Merchant Banker, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Liv|ing beyond the Seas, the &s;econd upon a Merchant Banker or other Per&s;on living in the &s;ame Country, tho di&s;tant from the place where the Bill is drawn; as to make a Bill payable at <HI>London,</HI> for money taken up at <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>; each having equal force ought to have due ob&s;ervance alike.</P>
<P>As to an Exchange, four, three or two Per&s;ons may make it thus, 2 at the place where the money is taken up, and 2 at the place were it is payable, fir&s;t the deliverer, &s;econdly the taket, thirdly the Per&s;on that is to take the money, and fourthly the party upon whom the Bill is drawn. 3 Per&s;ons thus, fir&s;t the taker, &s;econdly the deliverer, and thirdly the Per&s;on on whom the Bill is drawn.</P>

<P><PB N="295" REF="295">There is another &s;ort of Exchange cal|led a dry exchange, which is practi&s;ed thus, if a Per&s;on have occa&s;ion for 100 pound, he goes to a Banker who takes a Bill of Exchange of him to be payed at <HI>Lyons,</HI> or <HI>Paris</HI> at double or treble U&s;ance; tho the Drawer has no Corre&s;pondence in either of the Cities, then the Bill growing due, the Banker receives a Prote&s;t for non-pay|ment, upon which the Drawer in <HI>London</HI> mu&s;t pay the money with co&s;ts, which is a Trick to evade the Statute again&s;t Extor|tion.</P>
<P>There is likewi&s;e a feigned Exchange which is thus, the Banker agrees to lend me money upon Bill of exchange payable at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> yet between our &s;elves it is payable here, which if I pay at the time appointed, I receive my di&s;charge accord|ing to agreement, but if I make default, then the Banker Writes to his Friend at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> who &s;ends him a Bill of Ex|change for the like Summ owing him here, &s;o that I who borrowed the money, am obliged to pay the co&s;t of the exchanges and other charges.</P>

<PB N="300" REF="298">
<HEAD>CHAP. XCX. Several u&s;eful ob&s;ervations to be carefully noted, in the Management of Bills of Ex|change.</HEAD>
<P>OB&s;erve to note in your Book the Name of the place of aboad of the Per&s;on who pre&s;ents the Bill, keep Cop|pies of the Bills &s;ent to get accepted, make the direction of Bills on the in&s;ide, and all for the Rea&s;ons following.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t by knowing the place of Aboad of him that pre&s;ented the fir&s;t Bill, he may be the better excu&s;ed, if he except again&s;t the &s;econd Bill from the &s;ame Hand, before the fir&s;t be &s;atisfyed.</P>
<P>Secondly by taking Copies of Bills &s;ent to get acceptance, you may know how Ex|changes go in all places, and at the &s;ame time to know without any great trouble, on whom you are to call for your money, and what Day.</P>
<P>Thirdly to make the direction of Bills on the in&s;ide, will give larger Scope to Write this A&s;&s;ignment on the back &s;ide.</P>
<P N="4">4ly. Every Per&s;on who receives a Bill to get it accepted, whether for him&s;elf or
<PB N="301" REF="298">
another mu&s;t, tho &s;ome hold the contra|ry, pre&s;ent the &s;aid Bill in due time; that the Per&s;on who is to accept it, may order his affairs accordingly, and not be &s;urpriz|ed with the pre&s;entation of a Bill, ju&s;t when it becomes due.</P>
<P N="5">5ly. If a Bill be prote&s;ted after accep|tance, it does not clear the party who was faulty in non-payment, but renders him lyable to pay the charges; and expo&s;es him to an Action at Law, to which before he was not lyable, nor is the Drawer cleared, but obliged to &s;ee the Bill &s;atis|fyed.</P>
<P N="6">6ly. Times of payment are according to the di&s;tance or Cu&s;tom of the places, where the Bills are drawn, &amp; were payable, as has before been briefly touched, as from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Antwerp, Midelborrough, Rotterdam, Ly&s;le, Rouen</HI> and <HI>Paris,</HI> at a Months U&s;ance.</P>
<P N="7">7ly It is dangerous to draw a Bill payable to the bearer, by Rea&s;on if a Bill &s;hould happen to be lo&s;t, any Per&s;on might bring it for acceptance or payment, therefore the &s;afe&s;t way is to make it payable to a particular man, or his order; for otherwi&s;e if it &s;hould be payed to the wrong party, and the Bill received, he on whom it is drawn, is not lyable to pay it again unle&s;s a Fraud be proved.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="302" REF="299">81y. A Bill of Exchange is held &s;o Au|thentick, that it requires no witne&s;s, nor is it requi&s;ite that any Per&s;on unle&s;s the Per|&s;on that receives it be pre&s;ent at the Writ|ing thereof, or that any one be pre&s;ent, when the party who accepts it under-writes his name, for if any Per&s;on either Draw|er or Sub&s;criber &s;hould deny his Hand, it may be ea&s;iely proved by comparing his Letter or Books of Account, and if that be proved his credit is inevitably ruined.</P>
<P N="9">9ly. If you receive an Outland Bill pre|&s;ent it pre&s;ently, and if it be refu&s;ed pro|te&s;t without delay, and &s;end it back to the Drawer with Prote&s;t, which will be for the advantage of both. Twenty four Hours is the longe&s;t time, that you are obliged to give any Merchant to con&s;ider whether he will or not, and after that, it is at your plea&s;ure whether you will prote&s;t or give longer time, and after prote&s;t advice ought to be given to the Drawer by the fir&s;t Po&s;t.</P>
<P N="10">10. If a Bill be drawn on two Per&s;ons, and not to them or either of them, but joyntly, yet if one do accept it and the other refu&s;e it the Bill ought to be pro|te&s;ted.</P>
<P N="11">11. If a Bill be pre&s;ented to any Per|&s;on, and he by word of mouth, de&s;ires
<PB N="303" REF="299">
it may be left in his Hands, and does Ver|bally accept it, altho he afterwards refu&s;e to Sub&s;cribe it, yet &s;uch an acceptance is valid, and he may be Sued upon due Prote&s;t, tho Prote&s;t mu&s;t not be made till the money becomes due.</P>
<P N="12">12. If a man accept a Bill for part and not for the whole, alledging he has no more in his Hands; the Per&s;on to whom the money is payable, may receive the part and give an acquittance for &s;o much as he receives, but mu&s;t enter Pro|te&s;t for non-payment of the re&s;t, and &s;end it away as &s;oon as the party refu&s;es to ac|cept for the whole.</P>
<P N="13">13. The Drawer is Ma&s;ter of the Bill till it becomes due, and may Countermand it by &s;ending an Expre&s;s to the party, who has accepted it not to pay it without fur|ther order, which order mu&s;t be made, and pa&s;&s;ed before a publick Notary, and noti|fyed to the party that hath accepted the Bill, but if the money be pay'd it is pa&s;t re|covery.</P>
<P N="14">14. A Bill of Exchange may be pay'd at U&s;ance &s;ingle, double or treble, that is length of time according to the quality of the Per&s;on; the occa&s;ion or difficulty of pa&s;&s;age by Rea&s;on of different Sea&s;ons, but general U&s;ance is accounted a Month from
<PB N="304" REF="300">
the Date of the Bill, each month tho dif|ferent in number of Days being accounted, the Month required on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="15">15. A Bill payable at Days &s;ight, is from the Day after it is accepted, el&s;e Pro|te&s;t ought to be made. If an accepted Bill be lo&s;t, yet it will not Bar the payment, but may be Sued for as if the Bill were in be|ing, nor is the party who accepted it bound to pay a &s;econd Bill, before the fir&s;t be di&s;|charged, unle&s;s the &s;econd Bill be directed to the party who lo&s;t the Former in lieu thereof.</P>
<P N="16">16. When a Bill is accepted, there is no revoking it, but it mu&s;t be either payed or Prote&s;ted; tho &s;ometimes it hap|pens that the Acceptor and the Party to whom the Bill is payable, do conclude upon longer time then the Bill &s;pecifies, or to take it by Parcels; yet if he doubt the hone&s;ty of the Acceptor, the Pre&s;entor mu&s;t nowith&s;tanding make Prote&s;t, or the Acceptor may refu&s;e further payment, and yet not lye lyable to be Sued.</P>
<P N="17">17. If a Bill be directed to a party, and he be out of Town, not leaving any Warrant of Attorney, to impower his Wife or Servants to accept it; and another Mer|chant to &s;upport the Drawers credit, will accept and pay it, yet Prote&s;t mu&s;t be made again&s;t the party on whom it was drawn for non-acceptance.</P>
<P N="18"><PB N="305" REF="300">18. In &s;ome ca&s;es half U&s;ance is allow|ed, e&s;pecially in Inland Bills, which is ac|counted 15 Days.</P>
<P>Note that all Bills mu&s;t be Prote&s;ted 3 Days after they become due, it being dangerous to exceed that time, altho one of the Days happened on a Sunday, yet tho the 3 Days are expired, 'tis not at all unne|ce&s;&s;ary to Prote&s;t.</P>
<P N="19">19.

<HEAD>CHAP. CXI. Of Letters of credit, and to what intent they are drawn.</HEAD>
<P>THere are divers &s;orts of Letters, that pa&s;s between Merchants and Merchants, or Merchants and their Factors. As Letters of Commi&s;&s;ion for buying and &s;elling, Let|ters of advice, Letters of Fraight, and Let|ters of Credit; the latter of which are properly &s;uch as are Written to furni&s;h mo|nies by Exchange, upon the credit of him that Writes them, &s;o that by virtue of the Letter or Letters &s;o Written, the Mer|chant or Banker that Writes the Letter or Letters, are bound as firmly, as if they had given Bond to &s;atisfy by Bill of Ex|change; or otherwi&s;e any Summ or Summs of money, taken upon them by tho&s;e Per|&s;ons &s;pecifyed therein. And the&s;e Letters are two &s;orts, the one General and the o|ther &s;pecial.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is when I Write my open Let|ter to all Merchants, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who &s;hall Furni&s;h &s;uch and &s;uch Per&s;ons upon my Letter of credit, wherein I do bind my &s;elf, that what Monies &s;hall be delivered unto &s;uch and &s;uch

parties therein &s;pecifyed, within the time limited at &s;uch and &s;uch rates, or as the Exchange is currant; I will repay by Bills of Exchange or otherwi&s;e: and if any one &s;hould refu&s;e to pay Bills for monies receiv|ed upon his Letters of credit, yet tho&s;e Letters being produced, and proved to be his, are as binding as Hand and Seal, and &s;tand as good in Law.</P>
<P>The &s;pecial Letter of credit, is directed to a peculiar Per&s;on, and is of force equal with the former; as for the Forms of the General Letters of credit, they are vari|ous and &s;utable to the occa&s;ion of the Wri|ter, but the form of a &s;pecial or particular Letter of credit may run thus.

<HEAD>CHAP. CXIV. Of Policies of a&s;&s;urance, their Original, their Legality, Nature, Quality, and of the great Incouragement they give to Navi|gation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MO&s;t are of opinion that this way of in&s;uring, was fir&s;t invented by the <HI>Romans,</HI> and <HI>Suetonius</HI> will have it that <HI>Clau|dius Cae&s;ar</HI> was the fir&s;t contriver thereof, and by that means &s;o incouraged Merchants,

that they ventured into the till then &s;up|po&s;ed innavigable Seas; propo&s;ing to them&s;elves that if they e&s;caped with their Lives, tho both Ships and Goods were lo&s;t, they &s;hould not be much indammaged.</P>
<P>All a&s;&s;urances are either Publick or Pri|vate, the fir&s;t are tho&s;e that are entered in the Office or Court of A&s;&s;urance, for the Conveniency of Merchants kept upon the Royal Exchange in <HI>London</HI>; where any one may have knowledge of what <HI>Cargo</HI> is in|&s;ured and of the <HI>Premio.</HI> The la&s;t is in Pri|vate between man and man, and not enter|ed in the Office, and are of equal Validity at common Law, but by the Statute of the 43 of <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> only tho&s;e that are enter|ed in the Court of A&s;&s;urance can be tryed and determined there, the other being left to the common Law only. The&s;e A&s;&s;uran|ces are divers of &s;orts, &s;ome being made for places general, others certain; tho&s;e upon certain places or Ports are made upon Goods laden, which if they mi&s;carry before they are &s;afely Landed at the place agreed on, the In&s;urer mu&s;t make good as far as he has in&s;ured, but upon certain notice of their &s;afe Arrival, he may demand the Premio a|greed on, and the Policy is then void, and the like upon Goods inward bound, or ac|cording as the Merchant and In&s;urer can a|gree.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="312">A General An&s;urance is when a Ship goes a Trading Voyage, taking in at one Port and vending at another; &s;o that the In&s;urer is lyable to any damage &s;he &s;u&s;tains till &s;he returns in &s;afety to the Port from whence She &s;ets out, that is in her Cargo only, unle&s;s the Ship and her Appurtenances are in&s;ured, which are frequently included, tho then the Premio runs higher.</P>
<P>Goods &s;ent by Land may likewi&s;e be in|&s;ured, tho that &s;eldom happens; or if any Per&s;on fears being taken by the <HI>Turks</HI> or <HI>Moors,</HI> he may in&s;ure his Per&s;on of a cer|tain Premio, and then if he be taken, the in&s;urer is obliged to Ran&s;om him: that is, pay &s;o much money as is in&s;ured, &s;ome|times the <HI>A&s;&s;urers</HI> in&s;ert in their Policies lo&s;t or not lo&s;t, that is, when Ships have been a long time abroad, and no advice of their being in any Port, but then the Premio runs high as 30, 40, and &s;ometimes more <HI>per cent.</HI> for if the Ship be lo&s;t at the time the Poli|cy is Sub&s;cribed, yet &s;o much as is in&s;ured mu&s;t be made good, but then it mu&s;t be contrary to the knowledge of him that in|&s;ures, or otherwi&s;e it will be accounted a Fraud.</P>
<P>If any Per&s;on a&s;&s;ures a Rotten Ve&s;&s;el for more then She is worth, and then going out of the Port or Harbour, She Privately
<PB N="328" REF="313">
cau&s;es to be Wrecked or Sunk, if it can be proved it is a Defraud, and he who Sub|&s;cribed the Policy, is not bound to make &s;atisfaction, but it is ob&s;erved of late that &s;eldom any one Per&s;on will in&s;ure a whole Ship; but Sub&s;cribe 50 pound, 100 pound or more at a certain Premio, currant at the time of a&s;&s;uring; which when the adven|ture is Born they receive; but if a lo&s;s hap|pens, the Premio is deducted together with the u&s;ual Abatements; &s;o that the in&s;ured &s;eldom receives more then 80 pound in the 100 pound, and many now adays are &s;o adventurous, that they will en&s;ure again&s;t Heaven and Earth; Stre&s;s of Weather, Storms, Enemies, Pirates, Rovers, and all other Ca&s;ualties. If a Merchant en&s;ures a Ship, he only names in the Policy of &s;uch a Burthen, then if She be lo&s;t the In&s;urers are bound to make the Ship only good, and not the Wares: If the Wares be in&s;ured it matters not whether each particular is mentioned in the Policy, but in general up|on the chief Commodities, and all other Commodities laden or to be laden for the en&s;ured.</P>
<P>If a Ship be En&s;ured and take Fire 'ere She break Ground, the <HI>A&s;&s;urers</HI> in &s;uch a ca&s;e are not lyable to make Re&s;titution, unle&s;s the words be in the Policy at &s;uch
<PB N="329" REF="313">
a Port, or from &s;uch a Port, unle&s;s She had fir&s;t broken Ground, and had been forced back again by Storm.</P>
<P>If a Ship be En&s;ured and prove Leaky, and the Ma&s;ter for pre&s;ervation of the Car|go, lade it into another Ship, and that Ship be lo&s;t, the En&s;urer is not bound to make the Cargo good, unle&s;s in the Policy it is mentioned, untill the Goods by the &s;aid Ship or any other &s;hould be &s;afely Landed at &s;uch a place, naming it.</P>
<P>It is held that if a Per&s;on En&s;ure more Goods then he has on Board, and &s;everal Per&s;ons Sub&s;cribed the Policy, yet the fir&s;t Sub&s;cribers are only bound to pay the lo&s;s if they mi&s;carry, and tho&s;e that Sub&s;cribed over and above the value of the Goods, remitting their Premio 10 Shillings <HI>per cent.</HI> reducted for their Sub&s;criptions are di&s;charged: If a Cargo be En&s;ured to &s;uch a Port there &s;afely to be unladed, and her Cargo is &s;old on Board, the Property be|ing altered, if the Ship afterwards mi&s;carry, the En&s;urer is not obliged to make it good, if the buyer agrees for the Fraight to be car|ryed to any other Port.</P>
<P>If Goods be En&s;ured, and the En&s;ured contrary to the knowledge of the En&s;urer, Lades prohibited Goods, by which the Ship may become forfeited, then the En&s;urer
<PB N="330" REF="314">
is not lyable to make good the Cargo, unle&s;s after the lading of &s;uch Goods they are prohibited.</P>
<P>If any Goods be damaged in the Ship by neglect of the Ma&s;ter or Mariners, the En&s;urer is not bound to make Satisfaction. And further 'tis always expedient to prevent differences that may ari&s;e between the En|&s;urer and the En&s;ured, that the Bills of lading con&s;i&s;t of three parts, one to be &s;ent over Sea, the other left with the Ma&s;ter, and the la&s;t with the Lader.</P>
<P>This Office or Court of a&s;&s;urance, was erected by the Statute of the 43 of <HI>Eliza|beth,</HI> Chap. 12, whereby the Judges or Com|mi&s;&s;ioners appointed to determine differen|ces ari&s;ing, were the Judges of the Court of Admiralty, the Recorder of <HI>London,</HI> two Doctors of the Civil Law, two Barri&s;ters, eight di&s;creet Merchants or any five of them, and that they or the Major part, &s;hould have Power to hear, examine, order or decree all &s;uch cau&s;es in a Summary way, without pleading or expence, and to have Power to Summon Parties to Examine up|on Oath, commit to Pri&s;on upon di&s;obedi|ence, or the like; but this way being found tedious, becau&s;e &s;o many parties as made a Court, were not at all times to be Conve|ned, it was taken into con&s;ideration, and
<PB N="351" REF="314">
in the 12 of <HI>Car.</HI> 2 Chap. 23 Enacted that 3 Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould make the Court <HI>viz.</HI> a Doctor of the Civil Law, a Bar|ri&s;ter of 5 Years &s;tanding, and a Merchant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who have Power to Act in all ca&s;es, after their being Sworn before the Lord Major; and if the Witne&s;s refu&s;e to come upon the fir&s;t Summons, and tender of rea&s;onable charges, upon the &s;econd Sum|mons they may impri&s;on them for &s;uch their contempt, or give co&s;ts, and commonly differences come to an I&s;&s;ue in a Fort|night, their proceedings being as well out of Term-time as it.</P>
<P>The Judgments are there given upon mature deliberation, by Per&s;ons well Skil|led in Marine affairs; and if the Sentence be &s;uppo&s;ed unrea&s;onable, then the Lord Chancellor or Lord Keeper, may upon an appeal determine the &s;ame; tho no appeal from thence can lye before the whole mo|ney is depo&s;ited, and the full co&s;t payed to the appelled. So that it prevents the trouble of taking up the Party by Execu|tion, again&s;t whom the Decree has pa&s;&s;ed, and a further advantage is, they may in this Court decree again&s;t 20 En&s;urers at once, which at common Law mu&s;t be Sued di|&s;tinctly, tho the Execution cannot lye a|gain&s;t Body and Goods, but again&s;t either as at Common Law.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="315">And la&s;tly if a private Policy of a&s;&s;u|rance, be lo&s;t, and no Entery be found, it is like a Burnt Deed, unle&s;s &s;trong Evi|dence be produced; as likewi&s;e a Copy of the &s;ame: but if it be a Publick Policy, then the Entery is &s;ufficient Te&s;timony for this Court to take Cognizance of.</P>

<P><HI>FOenus Nauticum</HI> or <HI>Bottomery,</HI> is by the <HI>Dutch</HI> called <HI>Bomery, Bodmery,</HI> or <HI>Boddemerii</HI>; from the Keel or Bottom of a Ship, the Part being taken for the Whole, and was called by the Ancient Britains <HI>Bodo</HI> or <HI>Bo|dun,</HI> the bottom of a Ship, Signifying the bottom or the Cargo therein contained, the which as Land is mortgaged for certain Sums of Money taken up thereon, and is bound to &s;atisfy the &s;ame at return, with &s;uch intere&s;t as is agreed on the Statute of u&s;ury, in that ca&s;e being excluded by Rea|&s;on of the Hazard the Lender runs; for
<PB N="333" REF="315">
in many ca&s;es money is taken up thus. I lend 100 pound upon a Ship, to receive 150 if the Ship arrives &s;afe at &s;uch a Port, but if She chance to Mi&s;carry, my money is lo&s;t, and many times Ma&s;ters of Ships could not &s;et out, if they did not in this nature take up Monies; for which them|&s;elves, their Ship or Cargo become Pledges; but &s;ome Per&s;ons have taken hold of this occa&s;ion to Bar the Statute of u&s;ury: thus they get the Party to feign he has a Ship bound for <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> or any &s;uch Port, making a &s;pecial obligation to pay the mo|ney again at &s;o much <HI>per cent.</HI> at a rea&s;on|able time Granted for the return of the Ship; and if She do not in that time return the money to be pay'd notwith&s;tanding, but certain it is if a Per&s;on have 500 or 1000 pound lying by him, and knows of an ingenious Merchant or Ma&s;ter of a Ship, who is fitting out for a Voyage, and is Slen|derly &s;tocked, and he lends him this money to buy &s;uch Commodities as will vend in the places whither he is bound, running the Ri&s;que to have nothing, if the Ship mi&s;carry, and 30 <HI>per cent.</HI> Intere&s;t, if She re|turn &s;afe, it is altogether as profitable for the merchant as Ma&s;ter; as to take up mo|ney at Brokerage, and to En&s;ure his Ship or Cargo. And if the Merchant or Ma|&s;ter
<PB N="334" REF="316">
makes double return of the &s;aid mo|ney he gets &s;ufficiently, as well as the Venturer, and this cannot be accounted u&s;ury.</P>
<P>There is yet another way both profita|ble and Honourable, as thus, &s;uppo&s;e a Per|&s;on puts a &s;tock into the Hands of a Com|pany or Society, which is termed a per|petual &s;tock, the Principal being never to be recalled, tho it may be often &s;old for good advantage, but he that put it in or buys it receives &s;till his dividend, which produces &s;ometimes twenty and &s;ometimes more <HI>per cent.</HI> and the Hazard only is if the proportion of the &s;tock that goes out be lo&s;t, he mu&s;t abate, un|le&s;s by remitting the dividend he will keep up the &s;tock. And 100 pound in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company has been of late &s;old at 180 or 190 pound.</P>

<PB N="341" REF="319">
Fraight full laden, and the Ship has broke Ground; altho the Merchant revoke his intentions, yet the Fraight is by the Law Marine due. If in a Voyage a Ship without the neglect of the Ma&s;ter be di&s;a|bled, he may lade the Goods on Board a|nother Ve&s;&s;el, and if that Ve&s;&s;el be ca&s;t a|way, he is not lyable to make &s;atisfaction, if he can prove his own Ship was in a &s;inking condition, had not the Goods been taken out of her; but if this latter appear not he is lyable, unle&s;s both of the Ships are ca&s;t away: If a Ship be laded in Gro&s;s, and no particular number of Tuns mentioned, yet the Merchant &s;hall pay the Summ agreed for. If Pirates &s;et upon a Ship and take part of the lading, yet if the other part be carryed &s;afe to the Port concluded on in the Charter part, Fraight for the whole is due.</P>
<P>If any one Fraight prohibited Goods with|out the knowledg of the Ma&s;ter or Own|ers, and they be &s;eized in any Port, or the Ship be detained, the Merchant &s;hall pay Fraight notwith&s;tanding.

<P>A Wreck is properly when a Ship is ca&s;t away, and no live thing e&s;capes to Shoar; and then tho&s;e upon who&s;e Grounds the Goods are ca&s;t by the Sea, ought unle&s;s they are Peri&s;hable to keep them a twelve-month, to &s;ee if any will claim them; and if any do take &s;uch Goods, and contrary to the known Laws convert them to their own u&s;e, they are upon Conviction of the &s;ame, to pay four times the value to the owner, and as much to the King; but if the Goods are Peri&s;hable, then the Sherif, Cor|roner, or Bailif, in who&s;e Juri&s;diction they are found may &s;ell them, but mu&s;t be accoun|table for &s;o much money, to tho&s;e that can make out the Goods were theirs; and to pre|vent &s;uch Wrecks as much as may be, all

But if Goods Wrecked be not owned or Sued for within a Year and a Day, they fall to the King's Exchequer by the Law of <HI>Oleron,</HI> and the I&s;lue mu&s;t be tryed before the Judges of the Wrecks; always provided this Law do not extend to Pirates, Sea-Rovers, Ro|bers, <HI>Turks,</HI> or Enemies to the Chri&s;tian Faith, and if any who unju&s;tly detains any &s;uch Wrecked Goods, &s;hall refu&s;e to deli|ver them, or &s;atisfaction to the full value, he &s;hall be Impri&s;oned, and if a Lords Bailiff be therein found to offend, the Lord is ob|liged to deliver his Balif's Body to the King. And as for Cu&s;tom, Wrecked Goods rarely pay any, but if the Ship be ca&s;t away, or all the Goods or the Major part of them &s;aved, in &s;uch a ca&s;e they pay an ea&s;ie Cu&s;tom, as the Labour of &s;aving them was more or le&s;s difficult, and in that ca&s;e light Goods as Silver and Gold, according to value &s;hall pay le&s;s then heavy and Gro&s;s Goods.

<HEAD>A Di&s;cour&s;e of Trade. Being a Compari&s;on between <HI>England</HI> and other parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> wherein the Incouragement of Indu&s;try is pro|moted in the&s;e I&s;lands of <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. That a &s;mall Country and few People by Situation, Trade, and Policy, may be equivalent in Wealth, and Strength to a far greater People and Territories; and particularly that conve|niencies for Shipping and Water-Carriage do most eminently and fundamentally conduce thereto.</HEAD>
<P>THe fir&s;t principal Conclu&s;ion by rea&s;on of it's Length I con&s;ider in three parts, whereof the fir&s;t that a &s;mall Country and few People may be e|quivalent in Wealth and Strength to a far greater People and Territories.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="337">This part of the fir&s;t principal Conclu&s;ion needs little proof, fora&s;much as one Acre of Land may bear as much Corn and feed as many Cattle as twenty by the difference of the Soyl, &s;ome Parcels of Ground are natu|rally &s;o defen&s;ible as that 100 men being po&s;&s;e&s;t thereof, can re&s;i&s;t the Inva&s;ion of 500. Bad Land may be improved and made good, Bog may by dreining be made Mea|dow; Heath Land may (as in <HI>Flanders</HI>) be made to bear Flax, and Clover-gra&s;s, &s;o as to advance in value from 1. to 100. the &s;ame Land being built upon may centriple the Rent, which it yieldeth as pa&s;ture; one man is nimbler and &s;tronger and more pa|tient of Labour than another; one man by Art may do as much work as many, <HI>viz.</HI> one man with a Mill can grind as much Corn as 20. can pound in a Mortar, one Printer can make as many Copies as an hundred can write by hand; one hor&s;e can carry as much upon Wheels as five men upon their backs, and in a Boat, or upon Ice as 20; &s;o that I &s;ay again the fir&s;t point of this ge|neral po&s;ition needs little or no proof.</P>
<P>But the &s;econd and more material part of this Conclu&s;ion is, that this difference in Land and People ari&s;es principally from their Si|tuation Trade and Policy.</P>
<P>To clear this I &s;hall compare <HI>Holland</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="337">
and <HI>Zealand</HI> with the Kingdom of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> do not contain above 1. Million of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Acres, whereas the Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> contains above 80.</P>
<P>Now the original and primitive difference holds proportion as Lands to Land; for it is hard to &s;ay that when the&s;e places were 1&s;t. planted, whether an Acre of Land in <HI>Holland</HI> was better then the like quantity in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI>: Now is there any rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, but that therefore upon the fir&s;t Plantation the number of Planters was in proportion to the quantity of Land; wherefore if the People are not in proporti|on as the Land the &s;ame mu&s;t be attributed to the Situation of the Land, and to the Trade and Policy of the People.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>The next thing to be &s;hewn is that <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> at this day is not only <HI>80</HI>th. as rich and strong as <HI>France,</HI> but that it hath advan|ced to the <HI>3</HI>d. or thereabouts, which I think will appear upon the ballance of the following Particulars, viz.</HEAD>
<P>As for the Wealth of <HI>France,</HI> a certain Map of that Kingdom &s;et forth <HI>An.</HI> 1647. repre&s;ents it to be 15 Millions, whereof &s;ix did belong to the Church, the Author thereof (as I &s;up|po&s;e) meaning the Rents of the Land only
<PB N="4" REF="338">
And the Author of a mo&s;t judicious Di&s;cour&s;e of Husbandry (&s;uppo&s;ed to be Sir <HI>Richard We&s;ton</HI>) doth from rea&s;on and experience &s;hew that Lands in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> by bear|ing Flax, Turnips, Clover-gra&s;s, Madder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> will ea&s;ily yield 10 pound <HI>per</HI> Acre, &s;o as the Territories of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> &s;hould by this account, yield at lea&s;t 10 Millions <HI>per Annum</HI>; yet I do not believe the &s;ame to be &s;o much, nor <HI>France</HI> &s;o little as afore&s;aid, but rather that one bears to the other as about 7 or 8 to one.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> are one 3d part of tho&s;e in <HI>Paris</HI> or <HI>London,</HI> which two Cities differ not in People a 20th part from each other as hath appeared by the Bills of Buri|als and Chri&s;tenings from each, but the va|lue of the Buildings in <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> may well be half that of <HI>Paris</HI> by rea&s;on of the Foun|dations, Grafts and Bridges, which in <HI>Am|&s;terdam</HI> are more numerous and chargeable than <HI>Paris</HI>: Moreover the Habitations of the poore&s;t People in <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> are twice or thrice as good as tho&s;e of <HI>France</HI> but the People of the one to the People of the other being but as 13 to 1. the value of the Hou&s;ing mu&s;t be as about 5 to 1. The Ship|ping of <HI>Europe</HI> being about 2 Millions of tuns I &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have about 5000000, the <HI>Dutch</HI> 900 thou&s;and, the <HI>French</HI> 100

thou&s;and, the <HI>Hamburgers</HI> and the Subjects of <HI>Denmark, Sweden,</HI> and the Town of <HI>Dantzick</HI> 250 thou&s;and, and <HI>Spain, Portugal, Italy, &amp;c.</HI> 250 thou&s;and; &s;o as the Shipping in our ca&s;e of <HI>France</HI> to that of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> is about 1 to 9: which reckoned great and &s;mall one with another at 8 pound <HI>per</HI> Tun makes the worth to be 800 thou&s;and pounds to 7 Mil|lions, &amp; 2000000 pounds the <HI>Hollanders</HI> Capital in the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Company is worth about 3 Millions where the <HI>French</HI> has little or nothing.</P>
<P>The value of the Goods exported out of <HI>France</HI> into all parts are &s;uppo&s;ed quadruple to what is &s;ent to <HI>England</HI> alone, &amp; con&s;equent|ly in all about 5 Millions; but what is ex|ported out of <HI>Holland</HI> into <HI>England</HI> is worth 3 Millions; and what is exported thence into all the World be&s;ides is &s;extuple to that Summ.</P>
<P>The Moneys yearly rai&s;ed by the <HI>French</HI> King, as the &s;ame appears by the Book inti|tuled the <HI>State of France,</HI> dedicated to the King printed <HI>An. Dom.</HI> 1669. and &s;et forth &s;e|veral times by Authority, is 82 Millions of <HI>French</HI> Livers, which is about &frac12; Millions of pounds Sterling, of which Summ the Author &s;ayes that one 5th part was abated for Nonva|luers or In&s;olvencies.</P>
<P>So as (I &s;uppo&s;e) not above 5 Millions were effectually rai&s;ed, but whereas &s;ome
<PB N="6" REF="339">
&s;ay the King of <HI>France</HI> rai&s;ed 11 Millions as the &frac15; of the Effects of <HI>France,</HI> I humb|ly affirm, that the Land and Sea forces, all the Buildings and Interleguments which we have heard by common Fame to have been &s;et forth and made in any of the&s;e la&s;t 7 years needed not to have co&s;t 6 Millions Sterling; wherefore I &s;uppo&s;e he hath not rai&s;ed more, e&s;pecially &s;ince there were &frac15; in&s;olven|cies when the Tax was at that pitch.</P>
<P>But <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> paying 67 of 100 pay'd by all the United Provinces, and the City of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> paying 27 of the &s;aid 67, it follows that if <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> hath pay'd 4000 pound <HI>Flemmi&s;h per diem,</HI> or about 146000 <HI>per Annum,</HI> or about 80 thou&s;and pound Ster|ling, that all <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> have paid above 2 Millions <HI>per Annum</HI>; now the Rea&s;ons why they pay &s;o much, I think are the&s;e <HI>(viz)</HI> 1. the Author of the State of the <HI>Netherlands</HI> &s;aith &s;o.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Exci&s;e of Victuals at <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> &s;eems above half the Original value of the &s;ame <HI>(viz)</HI> ground Corn pays 20 Stivers the Bu&s;hel, or 63 Gilders the La&s;t, Beer 113 Stivers the Barrel, hou&s;ing &frac16; of Rent, fruit &frac18; of what it co&s;t; other Commodities 1/7 &frac18; 1/9 1/12 Salt <HI>ad libitum,</HI> all weighed Goods pay be&s;ides the premi&s;es a va&s;t &s;um: now if the expence of the People of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> at a Medium, and
<PB N="7" REF="339">
without Exci&s;e, were 8 pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> whereas in <HI>England</HI> 'tis 7 pound, then if all the &s;everal Impo&s;ts above named rai&s;e it 5 pound more, there being 160 thou&s;and Souls in <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> the Sum of 800 thou|&s;and pound Sterling <HI>per Annum</HI> will thereby be rai&s;ed.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Though the Expence of each Head &s;hould be 13 pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> 'tis well known that there be few in <HI>Amsterdam</HI> who do not earn much more than the &s;aid Ex|pence.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. If <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> pay <HI>per Annum</HI> 2,000,000 pounds, then all the Pro|vinces together mu&s;t pay about 3 Millions, le&s;s then which Sum <HI>per Annum</HI> perhaps is not &s;ufficient to have maintained the Naval War with <HI>England,</HI> 72 thou&s;and land Forces be&s;ides all other the ordinary charges of their Government, whereof the Church is there a part. To conclude, it &s;eems from the Premi|&s;es, that all <HI>France</HI> doth not rai&s;e above thrice as much from the publick Charge, as <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> alone do.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. Intere&s;t of Money in <HI>France</HI> 7 pounds <HI>per Centum,</HI> but in <HI>Holland</HI> &s;carce half &s;o much.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. The Country of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zea|land,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting as it were of I&s;lands guarded with the Sea, Shipping and Mar&s;hes, is de|fen&s;ible
<PB N="8" REF="340">
at &frac14; the charge of a plain open Country is, and where the Seat of War may be both Winter and Summer, whereas in others nothing can be done but in the Summer only.</P>
<P N="7">7thly. But above all the particulars hi|therto con&s;idered that of Superlucration ought chiefly to be taken in, for if a Prince have never &s;o many Subjects and his Country never &s;o good, yet if either through &s;loath or extravagant Expences or oppre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice, what ever is gained, &s;hall be &s;pent as fa&s;t as gotten, the State mu&s;t be account|ed poor. Wherefore let it be con&s;idered how much, or how many times rather <HI>Hol|land</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> are now above what they were 100 years ago; which we mu&s;t al&s;o do of <HI>France</HI>; now if <HI>France</HI> hath &s;carce doubled it's Wealth and Power, and that the other have decupled theirs; I &s;hall give the preference to the latter, even altho the 9 increa&s;ed by the one &s;hould not exceed the one half gained by the other; becau&s;e one hath a Store for 9 years, and the other but for 1. To conclude upon the whole, that though <HI>France</HI> being Peopled to <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> as 13 to 1, and in quantity of good Land as 80 to 1, yet is not 13 times Richer and Stronger, much le&s;s 80 times, nor much above thrice, which was to be proved.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="340">Having thus di&s;patched the two fir&s;t Branches of the fir&s;t principal Conclu&s;ion, it follows to &s;hew that this difference of im|provement in Wealth and Strength, ari&s;es in particular from conveniencies for Shipping and Water-carriage.</P>
<P>Many writing on this Subject do &s;o magni|fie the <HI>Hollanders</HI> as if they were more, and all other Nations le&s;s then men, (as to the matter of Trade and Policy) making them Angels, and others Fools, Brutes and Sots as to tho&s;e particulars, whereas I take the foun|dation of their Atchievements to lie ori|ginally in the Situation of the Country, whereby they do things inimitable to o|thers, and have advantages whereof others are incapable.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The Soyl of <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> is low Land, rich and fertile, whereby it is able to feed many men, and &s;o as that men may live near each other for their mutual A&s;&s;i&s;tance in Trade, I &s;ay that 1000 Acres that can feed 1000 Souls is better than 10000 of no more effect, for the following rea&s;ons to it <HI>(viz.)</HI> fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome great Fabrick were in building by 1000 men, &s;hall not much more time be &s;pared if that they lived all upon 1000 Acres, then if they were forced to live upon 10 times as large a Scope of Land?</P>

The charge of their care of their Souls, and the Mini&s;try would be far greater in the one ca&s;e then the other, as al&s;o of Mutual defence in ca&s;e of inva&s;ion, and even of Thieves and Robbers; moreover the charge of the Ad|mini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice would be much ea&s;ier where Witne&s;&s;es and Parties may be ea&s;ily Summoned, Attendance le&s;s expen&s;ive when mens Actions would be better known, when wrong and Ju&s;tice would not be covered as in thin-peopled places they are.</P>

<P N="2">2dly. <HI>Holland</HI> is a level Country, &s;o as, if in any part thereof a Wind-Mill may be &s;et up, and by it's being moi&s;t and vaporous, there is always Wind &s;tirring over it, by which advantage the labour of many thou|&s;and hands is &s;aved, fora&s;much as a Mill made by one man in half a year will do as much labour as 4 men for 5 years together; this advantage is greater or le&s;s where im|ployment and ea&s;e of Labour is &s;o, but in
<PB N="11" REF="341">
<HI>Holland</HI> it is eminently great, and the worth of this Conveniency between near 100 and 150 thou&s;and pound.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. there is much more to be gained by Manufacture than Husbandry, and by Mer|chandi&s;e than Manufacture, but <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand,</HI> being &s;eated at the Mouths of 3 long great Rivers, and pa&s;&s;ing through rich Countries do keep all the Inhabitants upon the &s;ides of tho&s;e Rivers but as Husbandmen, whil&s;t them&s;elves are the Manufactors of their Commodities, and do di&s;pence them into all Parts of the World, making re|turns for the &s;ame at what price almo&s;t they plea&s;e them&s;elves; and in &s;hort, they keep the Trade of tho&s;e Countries through which the &s;ame Rivers pa&s;s, the va|lue of this 3d convenience is 200 thou&s;and pound.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. In <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> there is &s;carce any place of work or bu&s;ine&s;s one Mile di&s;tance from a Navigable Water, and the charge of Water-carriage is generally but the 15th or 20th part of Land-carriages, wherefore if there be as much Trade there as in <HI>France,</HI> then the <HI>Hollanders</HI> can out-&s;ell the <HI>French</HI> 14/15 of all the Expence of all travel|ling po&s;tage and carriage what&s;oever, which even in <HI>England</HI> I take to be 300 thou&s;and pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> where the very po&s;tage

of Letters co&s;ts the People perhaps 50 thou|&s;and pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> though farmed at much le&s;s, and all other Labours of Hor|&s;es and Porters at lea&s;t &s;ix times as much; the value of this conveniency I e&s;timate to be above 300 thou&s;and pounds <HI>per An|num.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5thly. The defen&s;iblene&s;s of the Country by rea&s;on of it's Situation in the Sea upon I&s;lands, and in the Mar&s;hes, impa&s;&s;ible ground, dicked and trenched, e&s;pecially con&s;idering how the place is aimed at for it's Wealth, I &s;ay the charge for defending this Country is ea&s;ier than if it were a plain Champion at lea&s;t 200 thou&s;and pound <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6thly. <HI>Holland</HI> is &s;o con&s;iderable for keep|ing Ships in Harbour with &s;mall Expence of men and ground-tackle that it &s;aves them <HI>per Annum</HI> 200 thou&s;and pounds of what mu&s;t be &s;pent in <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>Now if all the&s;e natural Advantages do amount to above one Million <HI>per Annum</HI> of profit, and that the Trade of all <HI>Europe,</HI> nay of the whole World, with which our <HI>Eu|ropeans</HI> do trade, is not above 45 Millions <HI>per Annum</HI>; and if 1/50 of the value be 1/7 of the profit, it is plain that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> may command and govern the whole Trade.</P>

thus towards the Sea, abound with Fi&s;h at home, and having al&s;o the command of Ship|ping, have by con&s;equence the Fi&s;hing Trade, whereof that of <HI>Herring</HI> alone brings more yearly profit to the <HI>Hollanders</HI> than the Trade of the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> to <HI>Spain,</HI> or of the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> to them&s;elves, being as &s;ome &s;ay <HI>viis</HI> and <HI>modis</HI> of above 3 Millions <HI>per Annum</HI> pro|fit.</P>
<P N="8">8thly.

<P N="9">9thly. Tho&s;e who predominate in Fi&s;hing and Shipping have more occa&s;ion then o|thers to frequent all parts of the World, and to ob&s;erve what is wanting or redun|dant every where, and what each People can do, and what they de&s;ire, and con&s;e|quently to be the Factors and Carriers for the whole World of Trade, upon which ground they bring all Native Commodities to be Manufactured at home, and carried back to the Country where they grow, all which we &s;ee, for do they not work the

</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>Having thus done with their Situation I come now to their Trade.</HEAD>
<P>It is commonly &s;een that each Country flouri&s;heth in the Manufacture of it's own Native Commodity, <HI>viz. England</HI> for Woollen-Manufactures, <HI>France</HI> for Paper, <HI>Swihltand</HI> for Iron-ware, <HI>Portugal</HI> for Con|fectures, <HI>Italy</HI> for Silks. Upon which princi|ple it follows, that <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> mu&s;t flouri&s;h mo&s;t in the Trade of Shipping, and &s;o become Carriers and Factors to the whole World of Trade; now the Ad|vantages
<PB N="15" REF="343">
of Shipping Trade are as follow|eth, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Husbandmen, Sea-men, Souldiers and Merchants are the very Pillars of the Com|monwealth, all the other great profe&s;&s;ions do ari&s;e out of the infirmities and mi&s;carri|ages of tho&s;e: Now the Sea-man is 3 of the&s;e 4; for every Sea-man of indu&s;try and in|genuity is not only a Navigator, but a Mer|chant, &amp; al&s;o a Souldier, not becau&s;e he has of|ten occa&s;ion to fight, and handle Arms, but becau&s;e he is Mamilarized with hard&s;hip and hazards extending to Life and Limb; for Training and Duelling is a &s;mall part of a Soldier, in re&s;pect of his la&s;t men|tioned Qualifications, the one being quickly and pre&s;ently learned, the other not without many years mo&s;t painful Experience, wherefore to have the occa|&s;ion of abounding in Sea-men is a va&s;t con|veniency.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. the Husbandmen of <HI>England</HI> earn but about 4 <HI>s. per</HI> Week, but the Sea-man has as good as 12 <HI>s.</HI> in Wages, Victuals, Drink, and (as it were) Hou&s;ing with o|ther Accomodations, &s;o a Seaman is ineffect 3 Husbandmen, wherefore there is little Ploughing or Sowing of Corn in <HI>Holland</HI> or <HI>Zealand,</HI> or breeding of young Cattle, but their Land is improved by building
<PB N="16" REF="344">
Hou&s;es, Ships, Engines, Dickes, Wharfs, Gardens of plea&s;ure, extraordinary Flowers and Fruits, Dairy and feeding of Cattel, for Rape, Flax, Madder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the Foun|dations of &s;everal Advantagious Manufa|ctures.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. Whereas the imployments of other men is confined to their own Country, that of a Sea-man is free to the whole World; &s;o as where Trade may (as they call it) be dead, here or there, now and then, it is certain that &s;omewhere or other in the World, as Trade is always quick enough <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Provi&s;ion is always plentiful, the Benefit whereof they who command the Shipping enjoy, and they only.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. The great and ultimate effects of Trade is not wealth at large, but particularly abundance of Silver, Gold, and Jewels which are not peri&s;hable, but are wealth at all times and all places; whereas abundance of Wine, Corn, Fowl, Fle&s;h, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are riches but <HI>hic et nunc</HI>: So as the rai&s;ing of &s;uch Commodities, and the following of &s;uch Trade is not profitable before others, which do &s;tore the Countrys with Silver, Jewels, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but the labour of Seamen and Freight of Ships, of the Nature of an exported Commodity, the over-plus whereof a|bove what is imported brings home Mo|ney, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="17" REF="344">5thly. Tho&s;e who have the command of the Sea-Trade may work at ea&s;ier Freight, with more profit then others at greater, for as Cloth mu&s;t be cheaper made, when one Cards, another Spins, another Weaves, ano|ther Draws, another Dre&s;&s;es, another Pre&s;|&s;es, and Packs; then when all the Operati|ons above mentioned were clun&s;ily perform|ed by the &s;ame hand; &s;o tho&s;e who com|mand the Trade of Shipping, can build long &s;light Ships, for carrying Ma&s;ts, Firr, Timber, Boards, Bolkes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that one is for Lead, Iron, Stones, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> one &s;ort of Ve&s;&s;els to Trade at Ports, where they need never ly aground, others where they mu&s;t jump upon the Sand, twice every 12 hours, one &s;ort of Ve&s;&s;el, and way of Manning in time of Peace, and for cheap gro&s;s Goods, ano|ther for War, and precious Commodities, one &s;ort of Ve&s;&s;el for the Turbulent Sea, another for Inland Waters and Rivers, one &s;ort of Ve&s;&s;els and Rigging where ha&s;t is requi&s;ite, for the Maidenhead of a Market, another where &frac15; or 4/1 part of the time makes no matter, one &s;ort of Ma&s;ting and Rigging for long Voyages, another for Coa&s;ting, one &s;ort of Ve&s;&s;els for Fi&s;hing, another for Trade, one &s;ort for War, for this or the contrary, another for Burthen only, &s;ome for Oars, &s;ome for Poles, &s;ome

for Sails, and &s;ome for draught by men or Hor&s;es, &s;ome for the Northern Navigations among&s;t Ice, and &s;ome for the South a|gain&s;t Storms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And this I take to be the chief of &s;everal Rea&s;ons why the <HI>Hollanders</HI> can go at le&s;s Freight than their Neighbours <HI>(viz.)</HI> becau&s;e they can afford a particular &s;ort of Ve&s;&s;els, for each particular Trade.</P>
<P>I have &s;hewn how the Situation has gi|ven them Shipping, and how &s;hipping in ef|fects has given them all other Trade, and how Foreign Traffick mu&s;t give them as much Manufactures as they can mannage them&s;elves, and as for the over-plus make the re&s;t of the World but as Work|men to their Ships; it now remains to &s;hew the effects of their policy &s;uper&s;tru|cted upon the&s;e natural advantages, not as &s;ome think the exce&s;s of their under&s;tand|ings. I have omitted to mention that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> were 100 years &s;ince a poor and oppre&s;&s;ed People, living in a Country natu|rally cold moi&s;t and unplea&s;ant, and were withal per&s;ecuted for their Etrodoxy in Re|ligion.</P>
<P>From whence it nece&s;&s;arily follows that this People mu&s;t labour hard, and &s;et all hands to work, and Rich and Poor, young and old mu&s;t &s;tudy the Art of Number, Weight and Mea|&s;ure, mu&s;t fare hard, provide for Impotents,
<PB N="19" REF="345">
and for Orphans, out of hope to make profit by their Labours, mu&s;t puni&s;h the Lazy by Labours. I &s;ay all the&s;e particulars, &s;aid to be the &s;ubtile Excogitations of the <HI>Hollanders</HI> &s;eem to me but with what could not almo&s;t have been otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Liberty of Con&s;cience, Regi&s;try of Con|veyances, &s;mall Cu&s;toms, Banks, Lom|bards, and Law-Merchant, ri&s;e all from the &s;ame Spring, and tend to the &s;ame Sea. As for Loans of Intere&s;t, 'tis al&s;o a nece&s;&s;a|ry effect of all the premi&s;es, and not the fruit of their contrivance.</P>
<P>Wherefore we &s;hall only &s;hew in parti|cular, the Efficacy of each, and fir&s;t, of Li|berty of Con&s;cience; but before I enter upon the&s;e, I &s;hall mention a practice almo&s;t for|gotten, whether it refers to Trade or Poli|cy is not material, which is, the <HI>Hollanders</HI> underma&s;ting and &s;ayling of &s;uch of their Shipping as carry cheap and gro&s;s Goods, and who&s;e Sail doth not depend much upon Sea&s;on.</P>
<P>It is to be noted that of 2 equal and like Ve&s;&s;els if one &s;preads 1600 yards of like Canvas, and the other 2500, their Speed is but as 4 to 5, &s;o as one &s;oon brings home the &s;ame Timber in 4 days, as the other will in 5, now if we con&s;ider that although tho&s;e Ships be but 4 or 5 days under Sayl, that
<PB N="20" REF="346">
they are perhaps 30 upon the Voyage, &s;o as the one is but 1/30 parts longer upon the whole Voyage than the other, tho &frac15; longer un|der Sail; now if Ma&s;ts, Yards, Rigging, Cables, and Anchors, do depend upon the quantity and extent of the Sails, and con|&s;equently hands al&s;o, it follows that the one Ve&s;&s;el goes at 3/1 le&s;s charge lo&s;ing but 1/80 of the time and of what depends there|upon.</P>
<P>I come to the fir&s;t Policy of the <HI>Dutch, viz,</HI> Liberty of Con&s;cience, which I can con|ceive they grant upon the&s;e grounds, (but keeping up always a force to maintain the Common Peace)</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. They them&s;elves broke with <HI>Spain</HI> to avoid the Impo&s;ition of the Cler|gy.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Di&s;&s;enters of this kind are for the mo&s;t part thinking, &s;ober and patient men, and &s;uch as believe, that Labour &amp; Indu&s;try is their duty towards God, (how Erroneous &s;oever their Principles be.)</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The&s;e People believing the Ju&s;tice of God, and &s;eeing mo&s;t licentious per&s;ons to enjoy mo&s;t of the World and it's be&s;t things, will never venture to be of the &s;ame Religion and Profe&s;&s;ion with voluptua|ries, and men of extreme Wealth and Pow|er, who they think have their Portion in this World.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="21" REF="346">4thly. They cannot but know, that no man can believe what him&s;elf plea&s;es, and to force men to &s;ay they believe when they do not, is vain, ab&s;urd, and without Honor to God.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> knowing them|&s;elves not to be an Infallible Church, and that others had the &s;ame Scriptures for guide as them&s;elves, and withal the &s;ame Intere&s;t to &s;ave their Souls, did not think fit to make this matter their bu&s;ine&s;s, no more but to make Bonds of the Seamen they im|ploy, not to ca&s;t away their own Ships and lives.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. The <HI>Hollanders</HI> ob&s;erve that in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> e&s;pecially the Latter, the Church men are about 100 to one, to what they u&s;e or need, the principal care of whom is to pre&s;erve Uniformity, and this they take to be a &s;uperfluous charge.</P>
<P N="7">7thly. They ob&s;erve where mo&s;t endea|vours have been u&s;ed to keep Uniformity their Exterodoxy hath mo&s;t abounded.</P>
<P N="8">8thly. They believe that if &frac15; of the Peo|ple were Exterodox, and that if the whole quarter &s;hould by Miracle be removed, that within a &s;mall time 4/1 of the Remainder would again become Exterodox &s;ome way or other, it being Natural for men to differ in Opinions in Matters above &s;en&s;e and rea|&s;on,
<PB N="22" REF="347">
and for tho&s;e who have le&s;s Wealth to think thry have the more Wit and Under|&s;tanding, e&s;pecially in the things of God which they think chiefly to belong to the Poor.</P>
<P N="9">9thly. They think the ca&s;e of the Primi|tive Chri&s;tians, as it is repre&s;ented in the Acts of the Apo&s;tles, looks like that of the pre&s;ent Di&s;&s;enters, (I mean externally) moreover it is to be ob&s;erved that Trade does not (as &s;ome think) be&s;t flouri&s;h under popular Government, but rather that Trade is more vigorou&s;ly carried on in every State and Government by the exterodox par|ty of the &s;ame, and &s;uch as profe&s;s O|pinions differ from what are publickly e|&s;tabli&s;hed (that is to &s;ay) in <HI>India</HI> where the <HI>Mahumetan</HI> Religion is Authorized.</P>
<P>There the <HI>Banians</HI> are the mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble Merchants, in the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Empire, the <HI>Jews</HI> and Chri&s;tians, at <HI>Venice, Naples, Le|gorn, Genica,</HI> and <HI>Lisbon Jews,</HI> and now Pa|pi&s;ts Merchants Strangers. But to be &s;hort, in the part of <HI>Europe</HI> where the <HI>Roman</HI> Catho|lick Religion now has, or lately has had E&s;ta|bli&s;hment, there 3 qrs. of the whole Trade is in the hands of &s;uch as have &s;eparated from the Church, <HI>viz.</HI> The Inhabitants of <HI>Eng|land, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> as al&s;o the&s;e of the United Provinces, with <HI>Denmark,
<PB N="23" REF="347">
Sweden</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> together with the Sub|jects of the <HI>Norman</HI> Prote&s;tant Princes, and the Hans-Towns do at this day po&s;&s;e&s;s a quarter of the Trade of the World, and e|ven <HI>France</HI> it &s;elf the <HI>Hugonets</HI> are propor|tionably far the greate&s;t Trades, nor is it to be denyed but that in <HI>Ireland,</HI> where the &s;aid <HI>Roman</HI> Religion is not Authorized, but the profe&s;&s;ors thereof have a great part of the Trade, from whence it follows that Trade is not fixed to any Species of Religi|on as &s;uch, but rather as before hath been the &s;aid, to the heterodox party of the whole; the truth whereof appears al&s;o in all the par|ticular Towns of greate&s;t Trade in <HI>England</HI>; nor do I find rea&s;on to believe that the <HI>Roman</HI> Catholick Seamen in the whole World are &s;ufficient to man effectually a Fleet equal to what the King of <HI>England</HI> now has, but the now Papi&s;t-Seamen can do above thrice as much. Wherefore he whom this latter party does effectionately own to be their Head, cannot probably be wronged in his Sea-con|cernments by the Author; from whence it follows, that for the Advancement of Trade (if that be a Sufficient Rea&s;on) indul|gence mu&s;t be granted in matters of Opinion, tho&s;e Licentious Actings as even in <HI>Holland</HI> be re&s;trained by force.</P>
<P>The 2d. Policy or help to Trade u&s;ed by
<PB N="24" REF="348">
the <HI>Hollanders,</HI> is Securing the Titles to Lands and Hou&s;es, for although Lands &amp; Hou&s;es may be called <HI>Terra firma et res immo|biles,</HI> yet the Title unto them is no more certain then it plea&s;eth the Laws, and Authority to make them, wherefore the <HI>Hol|anders</HI> do by Regi&s;tries and other ways of a&s;&s;urance make the Title as immoveable as the Lands, for there can be no incourage|ment to Indu&s;try where there is no A&s;&s;u|rance of what &s;hall be gotten by it, and where by Fraud and Corruption one man may take away with ea&s;e and by a trick what another has gotten by extream labour and pains.</P>
<P>There has been much Di&s;cour&s;e about introducing of Regi&s;tories into <HI>England,</HI> the Lawyers for the mo&s;t part do object again&s;t it, alledging the Titles of Lands in <HI>England</HI> are &s;ufficiently &s;ecure already; wherefore omitting the con&s;iderations, of &s;mall and oblique Rea&s;ons, <HI>pro et contra,</HI> it were good that enquiry were made from the Officers of &s;everal Courts to what Sum or Value pur|cha&s;ers damnified for the&s;e la&s;t 10 Yeahs, by &s;uch fraudulent conveyance as Regi&s;tries would have prevented, the 10th part where|of at a Medium is the annual lo&s;s which the People &s;u&s;tain for want of them, and then Computation is to be made, of the annual
<PB N="25" REF="348">
charge of Regi&s;tring &s;uch extraordinary con|veyances, would &s;ecure the Titles of Lands more by comparing the&s;e two Summs, the Que|&s;tion &s;o much agitated, may be determined.</P>
<P>Their third Policy is their Bank, the u&s;e whereof is to encrea&s;e money or rather to make a &s;mall Sum equivalent to Trade in a greater, for the effecting whereof the&s;e things are to be con&s;idered: Fir&s;t how much Money will drive the Trade of the Nation, 2dly, how much current Money there is actually in the Nation. 3dly. how much will &s;erve to make all payments of under 5 Pound, or any other convenient Sum throughout the year. 4thly. for what Sum the Keepers of the Bank are unque&s;tionable &s;ecurity. If all the&s;e 4 particulars be well known, then it may be al&s;o known how much of ready Mo|ney above mentioned, may &s;afely and pro|perly be lodged in the Bank, and to how much ready current Money the &s;aid depo&s;i|ted Mony is equivalent; (as for example) &s;uppo&s;e 100 thou&s;and pounds will drive the Trade of the Nation, and &s;uppo&s;e there be but 60 thou&s;and pounds of ready Mony in the &s;ame; &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o the 20 thou&s;and pound will drive one, and an&s;wer all pay|ments made of under 150 pound, in this ca&s;e 40 of the 60 being put into the Brank will be equivalent unto 80, which 80, and 20,
<PB N="26" REF="349">
kept out of the Bank, do make up 100, <HI>viz.</HI> enough to drive the Trade, as was purpo&s;ed. Where note that the Bank-keepers mu&s;t be re|&s;pon&s;ible for double the Sum intru&s;ted with them, and mu&s;t have power to levy upon the General weight they happen to lo&s;e, unto particular Men; upon which grounds the Bankers may freely make u&s;e of the re|ceived 40 pound, whereby the &s;aid Sum and with the like Sum in credit, makes 80 pound, and with the 20 re&s;erved 100.</P>
<P>I might here add many more particulars, but being the &s;ame has already been noted by others, I conclude only with adding one ob&s;ervation which I think to be of con&s;e|quence; That the <HI>Hollanders</HI> do ridd their hands of 2 Trades, which are of great tur|moil and danger, and yet of lea&s;t profit. The 1&s;t whereof is that of a common and private Soldier, for &s;uch they can hire from <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Germany</HI> to ven|ture their Lives for 6 pence a day, whil&s;t them&s;elves &s;afely and quietly follow &s;uch Trades whereby the meane&s;t of them gain 6 times as much, and withal by this enter|taining of Strangers for Souldiers their Country becomes more and more peopled, fora&s;much as the Children of &s;uch Strangers are <HI>Hollanders,</HI> and take to Trades, whil&s;t new Strangers are admitted <HI>in finitum</HI>; be|&s;ides,
<PB N="27" REF="349">
the&s;e Souldiers at convenient intervals, do at lea&s;t as much work as is equivalent to what they &s;pend; and con&s;equently by this way of imploying of Strangers for Souldiers, they people the Country, and &s;ave their own Per&s;ons from Danger and Mi&s;ery, without any real Expence; effecting by this Method, what others have in vain attemp|ed by Laws for naturalizing of Strangers; as if men could be charmed to tran&s;port them&s;elves, from their own native, into a forreign Country, meerly by words, and for the bare leave of being called by a new Name. In <HI>Ireland,</HI> Laws for Naturalizati|on have had little Effect, to bring in Aliens; and 'tis no wonder if Engli&s;hmen will not go thither, without they may have the pay of Souldiers, or &s;ome other Advantage a|mounting to Maintainance.</P>
<P>Having intimated the way by which the Hollanders do increa&s;e their People, I &s;hall here digre&s;s to &s;et down the way of com|puting the value of every Head one with another, and that the in&s;tance of People in <HI>England; (viz.)</HI> Suppo&s;e the People of <HI>Eng|land</HI> be &s;ix Millions in number, that their Ex|pence at 7 pound <HI>per</HI> head be forty two Mil|lions, &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o that the Rents of Lands be eight Millions, and the profit of all the per&s;onal E&s;tate be &s;ix Millions more, it mu&s;t
<PB N="28" REF="350">
needs follow, that the Labour of the Peo|ple have &s;upplied the remaining thirty &s;ix Millions; the which multiplyed by twenty, (the ma&s;s of Mankind being worth twenty years Purcha&s;e as well as Land) makes five hundred and twenty Millions, as the value of the whole People; which number divi|ded by &s;ix Millions, makes above eight Pound Sterling to be the value of each Head, Man, Woman, and Child, and of a dull Per|&s;ons twice as much: From whence we may learn to compute, the Lo&s;s we have &s;u&s;tain|ed by the Plague, by the &s;laughter of Men in War, and by &s;ending them abroad unto the Service of forreign Princes. The other Trade the Hollanders have ridd their Hand of, is the old patriarchal Trade of being Cowkeepers, and in a great mea&s;ure of which concerns plowing and &s;owing of Corn, have put that Imployment upon the Danes and Polanders, from whence they have their young Cattle and Corn. Here we may take notice that as Trades and curious Arts in|crea&s;e, &s;o the Trade of Husbandry will de|crea&s;e, unle&s;s the Wages of Husbandmen mu&s;t ri&s;e, and con&s;equently the Rents of Lands mu&s;t fall.</P>
<P>For proof whereof I dare affirm that if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">andmen of <HI>England,</HI> who now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Pence a day, or thereabouts,

could become Trade&s;men, and earn &s;ixteen Pence a day, which is no great Wages, two Shillings, and two Shillings and &s;ix Pence being u&s;ually given; that then it would be the Advantage of <HI>England,</HI> to throw up their Husbandry, and make no u&s;e of their Lands, but for Gra&s;s, Hor&s;es, Milch-Cows, Gardens and Orchards, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which if it be &s;o, and that Trade and Manufacture have increa&s;ed in <HI>England, (viz.)</HI> If a quarter part of the People apply them&s;elves to the&s;e Faculties more then they did heretofore, and if the price of Corn be no greater now then when Husbandmen were more numerous, and Trade&s;men fewer: It follows from the &s;ingle Rea&s;on (tho others may be added) that if the Rents of Lands mu&s;t fall: as for Example, &s;uppo&s;e the price of Wheat be fifty or &s;ixty Pence the Bu&s;hel; now if the Rent of the Land whereon it grew be the third Sheaf, then of the &s;ixty Pence, twenty Pence is for the Land, and fourty Pence for the Husbandman; but if the Husbandman's Wages &s;hould ri&s;e &frac18; part, or from eight to nine Pence <HI>per diem</HI>; then the Husbandman's Share in the Bu&s;hel of Wheat, rai&s;ed from fourty to fourty five Pence, and con&s;equently the Rent of the Land mu&s;t fall from twenty to fifteen Pence; for we &s;uppo&s;e the price of the Wheat &s;till re|mains;
<PB N="30" REF="351">
e&s;pecially &s;ince we can't rai&s;e it, for if we did attempt it Corn would be brought unto us as unto <HI>Holland,</HI> from Forraign parts, where the State of Husbandry was not changed.</P>
<P>And thus I have done with the fir&s;t Prin|cipal Conclu&s;ion, That a &s;mall Territory and even a few people may by Situation Trade and Policy be made Equivalent to a far greater, and that conveniences for Ship|ping and Water-Carriage do mo&s;t Eminent|ly and Fundamentally conduce thereunto.</P>

<P>IF the money or other Effects levied from the people by way of Tax were de&s;troy|ed and annihilated; then it is clear, that &s;uch levies would dimini&s;h the Common-Wealth: or if the &s;ame were exported out of the Kingdom without any return at all, then

<P>Wherefore upon the whole matter, to know whether a Tax will do good or harm, the State of the People and of their Imploy|ments mu&s;t be well known, that is to &s;ay, what part of the People are unfit for Labour by their impotency and infancy, and al&s;o what part are exempt from the &s;ame by rea|&s;on of their Wealths, Function or Dignities, by rea&s;on of their charge and imployments, otherwi&s;e Governing Directing and Prefer|ring

<P N="3">3. It is to be con&s;idered, whether the re|mainder can make all, or any part of the&s;e Commodities which are imported from a|broad, which of them and how much in par|ticular; the remainder of &s;uch Sort of Peo|ple, if any be, may &s;afely and without po&s;|&s;ible prejudice to the Common-Wealth be imployed in Arts and Exerci&s;es of Plea&s;ure and Ornament; the greate&s;t whereof is the improvement of Natural Knowledge.</P>
<P>Having in general illu&s;trated this Point, which I think needs no other Proof but il|lu&s;tration, I come next to intimate that no part of <HI>Europe</HI> has paid &s;o much by way of Tax as <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Zealand</HI> for the&s;e la&s;t Forty years; and yet no Country has in the &s;ame time increa&s;ed&mdash;comparably to them; and it is manife&s;t they have followed the ge|neral rates above-mentioned; for they Tax Meats and Drinks mo&s;t heavily of all, to re&s;train the exce&s;&s;ive expence of tho&s;e things which twenty four hours do's as to the u&s;e of man, wholly annihilate; and they are
<PB N="35" REF="353">
more Favourable to Commodities to the greater duration: nor do they tax accord|ing to what men gain, but in extraordinary ca&s;es, but alwaies according to what men &s;pend, and mo&s;t of all to what they &s;pend needle&s;ly and without Pro&s;pect of return; up|on which Grounds their Cu&s;toms upon Goods imported and exported are general|ly low; as if they intended by them only to keep an Account, of what Forreign Trade, and to retaliate upon their Neighbours States, the prejudices done them by their Prohibiti|on and Impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>It is farther to be ob&s;erved that &s;ince th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> year 1636, the Taxes and Publick Levies made in <HI>England Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> have been Prodigiou&s;ly greater then at any time heretofore, and yet the &s;aid Kingdoms have increa&s;ed in their Wealth and Strength for the&s;e la&s;t Forty years, as &s;hall hereafter be &s;hewn; it is &s;aid that the French King doth at pre&s;ent levy the Fifth part of his peoples Wealth, and yet great Ob&s;tructions is made of the pre&s;ent Riches and Strength of that Kingdom; altho great care mu&s;t be had in di&s;tingui&s;hing between the Wealth of the peo|ple and that of an ab&s;olute Monarch, who taketh from the people where, when, and in what Proportion he plea&s;eth, the Sub|jects of two Monarchs may be equally Rich,
<PB N="36" REF="354">
and yet one Monarch may be double as Rich as the other; <HI>viz.</HI> If one take the Tenth part of the Peoples Sub&s;tance to his own di&s;po&s;e, and the other Twentyeth; nay, the Monarch of a poor people may appear more &s;plendid and glorious then that of a Richer; which perhaps may be &s;omewhat the ca&s;e of <HI>France,</HI> as hereafter &s;hall be exa|mined. As an In&s;tance and Application of what has been &s;aid I conceive that in <HI>Ireland</HI> where|in is above one hundred thou&s;and people, near three hundred thou&s;and Smoaks or Hearths, it were more tolerable for the people, and more profitable for the King, that each head paid two Shillngs-worth of Flax, then that each Smoke &s;hould pay two Shillings in Sil|ver, and yet for the&s;e following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Ireland</HI> being under-Peopled, and Cat|tle and Land very cheap, &s;tore of Fi&s;h and Fowl, the Ground yielding every where ex|cellent Roots (and particularly that bread like Root-Potatoes) and withal they be|ing able to perform their Husbandry with &s;uch Harne&s;s and Tackling as each man can make, living in &s;uch Hou&s;es as (almo&s;t) every man can Build; and every Hou&s;wife being a Spinner and Dyer of Wool, and Yarn, they can live and Subject after their pre&s;ent Fa&s;hions, without the u&s;e of Gold and Silver money, and can &s;upply them|&s;elves,
<PB N="37" REF="354">
with nece&s;&s;aries above named, with|out Labouring two Hours <HI>per diem.</HI> Now it has been found by rea&s;on of in&s;olvencies a|ri&s;ing, rather from the u&s;ele&s;ne&s;s, then want of Money among&s;t the&s;e poor People, that from 300000 Hearths, which &s;hould have yielded 30 thou&s;and pounds, not much above 15000 thou&s;and pounds of money could be levied; whereas it is ea&s;ily imagined that 4 or 5 People dwelling in that Cottage which has but one Smoke could ea&s;ily have Plant|ed a ground-Plat of 40 Foot Square with Flax, or the 50th. part of an Acre; for &s;o much ground will bear eighth or Ten Shil|lings-worth of that Commodity, and the rent of &s;o much ground in few places amounts to a Penny; nor is there any skill requi&s;ite to this Practice, wherewith the Country is not already Familiar. Now as for a Merchant for the &s;aid Flax, there is imported into <HI>Holland</HI> it &s;elf, over and above what the Country produces, as much Flax as is there &s;old for between eighth Score and 200000 pound. And into <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ire|land</HI> is imported as much Linnen Cloth made of Flax and there Spent as is worth above half a Million of money, as hereafter &s;hall be &s;hewn. Wherefore having &s;hewn that Silver money is u&s;ele&s;s to the poor People of <HI>Ire|land,</HI> that half the Hearth-money could

&s;carce be rai&s;ed by Rea&s;on thereof, that the People are &frac15; part imployed, that the People and Land of <HI>Ireland</HI> are competently qua|lifyed for Flax, that one Penny-worth of Land will produce Ten Shillings-worth of the &s;ame, and that there is Market enow and enow for above 100000 pounds-worth; I conceive my Propo&s;ition &s;ufficiently prov|ed, at lea&s;t to &s;et forward and promote a practice, e&s;pecially &s;ince if all the Flax &s;o produced &s;hould yield nothing, yet there is nothing lo&s;t, the &s;ame time having been wor&s;e &s;pent before upon the &s;ame Ground: the like Tax of two Shillings <HI>per</HI> head, may be rai&s;ed with the like advantage from the People of <HI>England</HI> which would amount to Six hundred thou&s;and pounds.&mdash;<HI>per Annum</HI> to be paid in Flax manufactured in|to all &s;orts of Linens, Threds, Tapes and Laces which we now receive from <HI>France, Flanders, Holland</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> the value whereof does far exceed the &s;um la&s;t men|tioned, as has appeared by the examination of Particulars.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved by Clothiers and others who imploy great numbers of poor people, that when Corn is extreamly plentiful the La|bour of the Poor is Proportionably dear, and Scarce to be had at all; (So licentious are they who Labour only to Eat, or rather
<PB N="39" REF="355">
to Drink:) wherefore when &s;o many Acres of Corn as do u&s;ually produce &s;ufficient &s;tore for the Nation, &s;hall produce perhaps dou|ble to what is exported, or nece&s;&s;ary; it &s;eems not unrea&s;onable, that this common Ble&s;&s;ing of God &s;hould be imployed to the common good of the People, repre&s;ented by their Sovereign; much le&s;s that the &s;ame &s;hould be abu&s;ed by the vile and bruti&s;h part of Mankind, to the prejudice of the Common-Wealth; and con&s;equently that &s;uch Surplu&s;age of Corn &s;hould be &s;ent to Publick Store-Hou&s;es, from thence to be di&s;po&s;ed of to the be&s;t advantage of the Publick. Now if the Corn &s;pent in <HI>England</HI> at five Shilings <HI>per</HI> Bu&s;hel Wheat, and two Shillings &s;ix Pence Barley be worth 10,000,000. It follows that in Years in great Plenty when the &s;aid Grains are &frac13; part cheaper, that a va&s;t advantage might accrue to the Common-Wealth, which now is &s;pent in once feeding the People in quantity, or quality, and &s;o&punc; in di&s;po&s;ing them to their u&s;ual Labour. The like may be &s;aid of Sugar, Tobacco, and Pepper, which Cu&s;toms has now made nece&s;&s;ary to all &s;orts of People, and with overplanting them has made un|rea&s;onably cheap; I &s;ay, it is not ab&s;urd that the Publick &s;hould be advantaged by this

Now if there be 300,0000. of Males in <HI>England</HI> there be above 200,000. of them who are between the Age of &s;ixteen and thirty unmarryed Per&s;ons, and who live by their Labour and Service; for of &s;o many the pre&s;ent <HI>Militia</HI> con&s;i&s;ts, and if 150,000. of the&s;e were Armed and trained as Foot, and 50000 as Hor&s;e, the &s;aid Force at Land together with 30,000. men at Sea, would by Gods ordinary Ble&s;&s;ing, defend the Na|tion being an I&s;land again&s;t any force in view; but the charge of Arming, di&s;ci|plining and rendevouzing all their men twice or thrice a Year would be a very Gentle Tax levied by the People them&s;elves and paid to them&s;elves.

when they &s;tay at home, not exceeding &s;ix pound for tho&s;e who have &s;erved &s;ix years or upwards; it follows that about 72000. pound at the <HI>medium</HI> of three pound <HI>per</HI> man would &s;o &s;atiate the whole number; and &s;o fora&s;much as half the Sea-men which manage the Merchants Trade are &s;uppo&s;ed to be always in Harbour, and are about 40000 together with the &s;aid half, the Auxi|liaries la&s;t mentioned, would upon Emer|gencies man out the whole Royal <HI>Navy,</HI> leaving to the Merchant 12000 of the able Auxiliaries to perform their bu&s;ine&s;s in Harbour, till others come home from the Sea; I &s;ay that more then this Summ 72000 pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> is Fruitle&s;ly &s;pent &amp; over-paid by the Merchants when&s;oever a great Fleet is to be fitted out. Now the&s;e whom I call Auxiliary Seamen are &s;uch as have another Trade be&s;ides wherewith to maintain them&s;elves when they are not imployed at Sea; and the charge of main|taining them&s;elves the 72000 pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> I take to be little or nothing for the Rea&s;ons above-mentioned, and con&s;e|quently an ea&s;ie Tax to the people becau&s;e levied by and paid to them&s;elves.

Thirdly by Rea&s;on of the pau|city and di&s;tance of their Harbours one from another their Seamen and Trade&s;men relating to Shipping can't corre&s;pond with, or A&s;&s;i&s;t, one another &s;o ea&s;ily, cheaply, advantageou&s;ly, as in other places; wherefore if their Shipping-Trade is not like to increa&s;e within them&s;elves, and much le&s;s to increa&s;e by their beating out the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Hollanders</HI> from being the Carriers of the World, it follows then, their Seamen will not be increa&s;ed by their increa&s;e of their Trade, wherefore and for that they are not like to be increa&s;ed by any of their &s;everal ways above &s;pe|cifyed, and for that their parts are not

Land the <HI>French</HI> King has al&s;o in <HI>America</HI> a. And if any man will be Heterodox in behalf of the French Intere&s;t, I could be contented again&s;t my Judgment to allow the <HI>French</HI> King's Territories to be a &s;eventh, &s;ixth, or fifth part greater then tho&s;e of the King of <HI>England,</HI> believing that both Princes have more Land then they do imploy to its ut|mo&s;t u&s;e.</P>
<P>And here I beg leave among the &s;everal matters, I intend for &s;erious, to interpo&s;e a jocular, and perhaps a Ridiculous digre&s;&s;ion, and which I indeed de&s;ire men to look upon rather as a Dream, then a rational Propo&s;iti|on: Which is if that all the moveables and People of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the High-lands of <HI>Scotland,</HI> were tran&s;ported into the Kingdom of <HI>Great Brittain,</HI> that then the King and his Subjects, would thereby become more Rich and Strong; both offen&s;ively and defen&s;ive|ly, then now they are.</P>
<P>Its true, I have heard many wi&s;e men &s;ay, when they were bewailing the va&s;t Lo&s;&s;es of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in preventing and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Rebellions in <HI>Ireland</HI>; and con&s;idering how little profit has returned either to the King or Subjects of <HI>England</HI> for the&s;e five hundred Years doing and &s;uffering in that Countrey; I &s;ay, I have heard Wi&s;e men in &s;uch their Melancholies, wi&s;h that the Peo|ple
<PB N="56" REF="364">
of <HI>Ireland</HI> being &s;aved, that that I|&s;land were &s;unk under Water. Now it troubles me that the Di&s;tempers of my Mind in this point, carry me to Dream, that the Benefits of the&s;e Wi&s;hes may Practically be obtained without &s;inking that va&s;t Moun|tainous I&s;land under Water; which I take to be &s;omewhat difficult, for altho <HI>Dutch</HI> En|gineers may drein its Bogs, yet I know no Arti&s;ts that could &s;ink its Mountains.</P>
<P>If ingenious and Learned men, among&s;t whom I reckon Sr. <HI>Thomas Moore,</HI> and <HI>Des Cartes,</HI> have di&s;puted that we who think our &s;elves awake, are, or may be really in a Dream: And if the greate&s;t ab&s;urdity of Dreams, is but a Prepo&s;terous and Tumul|tuary Contexture of Reallities, I will crave the umbrage of the&s;e great Men to &s;ay &s;ome|thing too, of this wild Conception, with Sub|mi&s;&s;ion to the better Judgments of all tho&s;e that can prove them&s;elves awake: If there were but one man Living in <HI>England,</HI> then the benefit of the whole Territories could be but the third Lively-hood of that one Man: But if another man were added, the Rent or Benefit of the &s;ame would be double, if three triple; and &s;o forewards until &s;o many were Planted in it, as the whole Territory could afford Food unto; for if a man would know what any piece
<PB N="57" REF="364">
of Land is worth, the true natural que&s;ti|on mu&s;t be; how many Men will it feed, and how many Men are there to be fed.</P>
<P>But to &s;peak more Practically, Land of the &s;ame quantity and quality in <HI>England,</HI> is generally worth three or four times as much as in <HI>Ireland</HI>? And but one quarter, and a third of what it is in <HI>Holland</HI>; becau&s;e <HI>England</HI> is four times &s;o well Peopled as <HI>Ireland,</HI> and be a quarter &s;o well as <HI>Holland</HI>: And moreover, where the Rent of Land is advanced, by rea&s;on of the multitude of People, there the number of years pur|cha&s;e for which the Inheritance may be &s;old is al&s;o advanced, tho perhaps not in the ve|ry &s;ame Proportion; for twenty Shillings <HI>per Annum</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> may be worth but eight pound, and in <HI>England</HI> where Tithes are very &s;ure about twenty pound, in <HI>Hol|land</HI> about thirty pound, I &s;uppo&s;e that in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the Highlands of <HI>Scotland,</HI> there may be above 1800,000 People, or about &frac15; part of what is in all the three Kingdoms. Where|fore the fir&s;t que&s;tion will be, whether <HI>Eng|land, Wales,</HI> or the <HI>Lowland</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> can't afford Food, that is to &s;ay, Corn, Fle&s;h, Fi&s;h, and Fowl, to a &frac15; more People then are at pre&s;ent planted upon it; with the &s;ame Labour that the &s;aid &frac15; part does now take where they are, for if &s;o, then what
<PB N="58" REF="365">
is propounded is naturally po&s;&s;ible. Second|ly it is to be inquired into, what the move|ables which upon &s;uch removable, mu&s;t be left behind are worth; for if they are worth le&s;s than the advancement of the price of Land in <HI>England</HI> will amount unto, then the Propo&s;al is to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the relict Land and the immovables left behind upon them may be &s;old for mo|ney, or if no other Nation &s;hall dare to meddle with them without paying well for them, and if the Nation who &s;hall be admit|ted &s;hall be le&s;s able to prejudice and annoy the Tran&s;planters into <HI>England</HI> then before; then I conceive the whole propo&s;al will be a plea&s;ant Dream indeed.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t part, whether <HI>England</HI> and the <HI>Lowlands</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> will mantain one fifth more then they now do, that is to &s;ay, nine Millions of Souls in all, I &s;ay, fir&s;t that the &s;aid Territories of <HI>England, &amp;c.</HI> con|tain about thirty &s;ix Millions of Acres, that is four Acres for every Head, Man, Woman and Child, but the united Provinces do not allow &frac12; Acre, and <HI>England</HI> it &s;elf, re&s;cind|ing <HI>Wales,</HI> has but three Acres to ever Head according to the pre&s;ent State of Tillage and Husbandry.

again&s;t the importation of Cattle, Fle&s;h and Fi&s;h from abroad, and that the Drein|ing of the Fens, improving of Forre&s;ts, in|clo&s;ing of Commons, Sowing of cinque-Foyl and Clover-Gra&s;s be grumbled again&s;t by Landlords, are the way to depre&s;s the price of Victuals, then it plainly follows, that till then three Acres improved, as it may be, will &s;erve the turn, and con&s;equently that four will Suffice abundantly. I could here &s;et down the very number of Acres that would bear Bread and Drink, Corn, toge|ther with Fle&s;h, Butter, and Chee&s;e, &s;uffici|ent to Victual nine Millions of Per&s;ons, as they are Victualled in Ships and regular Families; but I &s;hall only &s;ay in general that 12,000,00. will do it, with &s;uppo&s;ing that Roots, Fruits, Fi&s;h, and Fowl, and the or|dinary profit of Lead, Tin, Iron-Mines, and Woods would piece up any defect that may be found. As to the &s;econd I &s;ay that the Land and Hou&s;ing of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and <HI>High|lands</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> at the pre&s;ent Merchant-Rates, are not worth ten Millions of money, nor would the actual charge of making the Tran&s;plantation amount to two Millions more; &s;o then the que&s;tion will be whether the benefit expected from this Tran&s;planta|tion will exceed two Millions.</P>
<P>To which I &s;ay that the advantage will

<P>Now if any man &s;hall de&s;ire a more clear

The Book called the State of <HI>France</HI> makes the King|dom con&s;i&s;t of twenty &s;even Pari&s;hes; and another Book written by a Sub&s;tantial Au|thor, who profoundly enquires into the State of the Church and Church-men of <HI>France,</HI> &s;ets down as an extraordinary ca&s;e, that a Pari&s;h in <HI>France</HI> &s;hould have &s;ix hun|dred Souls, where I &s;uppo&s;e the &s;aid Author who has &s;o well examined the matter, is not of opinion that every Pari&s;h one with a|nother has above five hundred, by which reck|oning the whole people of <HI>France</HI> are a|bout thirteen Millions 500,000: Now the

people of <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> with the I&s;lands adjoyning, by computation from the number of Pari&s;hes (which com|monly have more people in Prote&s;tant Churches then in Popi&s;h Countries) as al&s;o from the Hearth-money, Po&s;t-money and Exci&s;e, do amount to above nine Millions; there are in new-<HI>England</HI> about fifty thou|&s;and men mu&s;tered in Arms, about eighty thou&s;and able to bear Arms, and con&s;e|quently about five hundred thou&s;and in all; but this la&s;t I leave to every man's con|jecture, and I &s;ee no Rea&s;on why in all the re&s;t of the Plantations there &s;hould not be five hundred thou&s;and more, and con&s;e|quently I &s;uppo&s;e the King of <HI>England</HI> hath above ten Millions of Subje&s;ts, <HI>ubivis terra|rum orbis.</HI> Altho it be very material to know the number of Subjects, belonging to each Prince; yet when the que&s;tion is con|cerning their Wealth and Strength, it is al&s;o material to examine how many of 'em do get more then they &s;pend, and how many le&s;s: in order whereunto, it is to be con&s;idered, that in the King of Englands do|minions there are twenty thou&s;and Church|men, but in <HI>France,</HI> as the aforementioned Author of theirs does aver who &s;ets down the particular number of each Religious order, there are about 270000. <HI>viz.</HI> 250000.
<PB N="64" REF="368">
more then we think are nece&s;&s;ary; that is to &s;ay, two hundred and fifty thou&s;and with-drawn out of the World; now the &s;aid number of adult and able-Bodyed Per&s;ons are equivalent to about double the &s;ame number of the Promi&s;cuous Ma&s;s of Mankind; and the &s;ame Author affirms that the &s;aid Religious Per&s;ons do &s;pend one with another above eighteen pence <HI>per diem</HI> which is Triple to what a Labouring man requires: Wherefore the &s;aid two hundred &amp; fifty thou&s;and Church-men, living as they do make the <HI>French</HI> King 13,500. thou&s;and to be really no better then twelve Millions or thereabouts. In the next place it is to be con&s;idered that the inhabitants of the inner parts of <HI>France</HI> remote from the Sea can't be probably Superlucrators. Now if there be two Millions in the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Dominions more then in the French Kings who earn more then they &s;pend, or if ten men in <HI>England</HI> earn more then twelve in <HI>France,</HI> then the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> are as effective as to the gain|ing of Wealth and Riches as tho&s;e of <HI>France,</HI> and if Ten men can defend them&s;elves as well in I&s;lands as twelve men upon the Continent, then the &s;aid Ten being not con|cerned to increa&s;e their Territory by the inva&s;ion of others are as effectual as the

<P>There are in <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;ix thou&s;and Tuns of Shipping, worth a|bout 4500,000. 4 &frac12;. and the actual charge of maintaining the Shipping afore&s;aid by new building and reparation is about &frac13; of the &s;aid Summ, which is the wages of 150.

<P>Moreover upon this principal the decay of Timber in <HI>England</HI> is no very formida|ble thing; as the rebuilding of <HI>London,</HI> and of the Ships wa&s;ted by the Dutch-War, do clearly manife&s;t: nor can there be any want of Corn or other nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> unle&s;s the Weather has been univer&s;ally un&s;ea&s;onable for growth of the &s;ame, which &s;eldom or never happens; for the &s;ame cau&s;e which makes dearth in one place, does after cau&s;e plenty in another, wet-weather being propitious to Highlands, which drown|eth the low.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved that the poor of <HI>France</HI> have generally le&s;s wages then in <HI>England,</HI> and yet their Victuals are generally dearer there, which being &s;o, there may be more Superlucration in <HI>England</HI> then in <HI>France.</HI></P>

<P>It will be here objected that the Splendor and Magnificences of the French King ap|pearing greater then tho&s;e of the Kings of <HI>England,</HI> that the Wealth of <HI>France</HI> mu&s;t be proportionably greater then that of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> but that does not follow forasmuch as the apparent greatne&s;s of the King does de|pend upon the quarter parts of the peoples Wealth which he levieth from them; for &s;uppo&s;ing the People are equally Rich; if one of the Sovereigns levy fifth part, and the other fifteenth, the one &s;eems actually thrice as Rich as the other, whereas potentially they are both equal.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V. That the Impediments of <HI>England</HI>'s Greatne&s;s are contingent and remo|vable.</HEAD>
<P>THe fir&s;t impediment of Englands Great|ne&s;s is, the Territories thereunto be|longing are too far a&s;under and divided by the Sea into &s;o many &s;everal I&s;lands and Countries; and I may &s;ay into &s;o many Kingdoms and different Governments, <HI>viz.</HI> There be three di&s;tinct Legi&s;lative Powers in <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> the which of in&s;tead of uniting together do often cro&s;s one and others Intere&s;t, putting Bars and Impediments upon one and others Trades; not only as they were forraigners to each other, but &s;ometimes as Enemies.</P>
<P>The I&s;lands of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Guern&s;ey</HI> and the I&s;le of <HI>Man</HI> are under juri&s;dictions diffe|rent from tho&s;e either of <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>The Government of <HI>New-England</HI> (both civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical) do &s;o differ from
<PB N="76" REF="373">
that of his Maje&s;ties other Dominions, that it is hard to &s;ay what may be the Con&s;equence of it.</P>
<P>And the Government of the other Plan|tations do al&s;o differ very much from any of the We&s;t, altho there be naturally &s;ub|&s;tantial Rea&s;ons for the Situation, Trade and Condition of the People, why there &s;hould be &s;uch differences; from all which it comes to pa&s;s the &s;mall divided remote Governments being &s;eldom able to defend them&s;elves, the Burthen of the Protecting them all, mu&s;t lye upon the chiefe&s;t King|dom of <HI>England</HI>; and all the &s;mall King|doms and Dominions, in&s;tead of being addi|tions, are really diminutions.</P>
<P>The Wealth of a King is three-Fold, one is the Wealth of Subjects, the &s;econd is the quota parts of his Subjects Wealth given him for the Publick Defence, Honour and Ornaments of the people, and to man|age &s;uch undertakings for the common good as no one, or a few private men, are &s;uffi|cient for.</P>
<P>The third &s;ort are the quota of the la&s;t mentioned quota parts which the King may di&s;po&s;e of as his own Per&s;onal inclination and di&s;cretion &s;hall direct; now it is mo&s;t manife&s;t that the aforementioned di&s;tance and differences of Kingdoms, and juri&s;dicti|ons,
<PB N="77" REF="373">
are great impediments to all the &s;aid &s;everal &s;orts of Wealth, as may be &s;een in the following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. In ca&s;e of War with forraign Na|tions, <HI>England</HI> commonly beareth the whole Burthen and charge, whereby many in <HI>England</HI> are utterly undone.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>England</HI> &s;ometimes prohibiting the Commodities of <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> (as of late it did the Cattle, Fle&s;h, and Fi&s;h, of <HI>Ireland,</HI>) did not only make Food, and con|&s;equently Labour, dearer in <HI>England,</HI> but al&s;o has forced the People of <HI>Ireland</HI> to fetch the&s;e commodities from <HI>France, Holland</HI> and other places which before was &s;old them from <HI>England,</HI> to the great Prejudice of both Nations.</P>
<P N="3">3. It occa&s;ions an unnece&s;&s;ary trouble and charge in collecting of Cu&s;toms upon Commodities pa&s;&s;ing between the &s;everal Nations.</P>
<P N="4">4. It is a dammage to our <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and other American Trades, that the Goods, which might pa&s;s thence immediately to &s;e|veral parts of the World, and be &s;old at moderate Rates, mu&s;t fir&s;t come into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and there pay Duties, and afterwards (if at all) pa&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e Countries whi|ther they might have gone immediately.</P>
<P N="5">5. The I&s;lands of <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> and <HI>Guern&s;ey</HI>
<PB N="78" REF="374">
are protected at the charge of <HI>England,</HI> neverthele&s;s the Labour and Indu&s;try of that People (which is very great) redound mo&s;t to the profit of the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. In <HI>New-England</HI> there are va&s;t num|bers of able Bodied Engli&s;h-men imployed chiefly in Husbandry, and in the meane&s;t part of it (which is) breeding of Cattle, whereas <HI>Ireland</HI> would have contained all tho&s;e Per&s;ons, at the wor&s;t would have afforded them Lands in better Terms then they have them in <HI>America,</HI> if not &s;ome other better Trade withal, then now they can have.</P>
<P N="7">7. The Inhabitants of the other Plan|tations, altho they do indeed Plant commo|dities which will not grow &s;o well in <HI>Eng|land,</HI> it gra&s;ping at more Land then it will &s;uffice to produce the &s;aid exotics in a &s;uf|ficient quantity to &s;erve the whole World, they do therein but di&s;tract and confound the effects of their own Indeavours.</P>
<P N="8">8. There is no doubt that the &s;ame peo|ple far and wide di&s;per&s;ed mu&s;t &s;pend more upon their Government and Protection then the &s;ame living compactly, and when they have no occa&s;ion to depend upon the Wind, Weather, and all the Accidents of the Sea.</P>
<P>A &s;econd impediment to the greatne&s;s of <HI>England,</HI> is the different under&s;tanding of
<PB N="79" REF="374">
&s;everal material points, <HI>viz.</HI> The Kings Prerogative, Priviledges of Parliament, the ob&s;cure differences between Law and Equity, as al&s;o between Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Juri&s;diction, doubts whether the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> has Power over the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> be&s;ides the wonderful Paradox, that the Engli&s;h-men lawfully &s;ent to &s;uppre&s;s Rebells in <HI>Ireland</HI> &s;hould (after having ef|fected the &s;ame) be (as it were) disfran|chi&s;ed, and loo&s;e that intere&s;t in the Legi&s;|lative Power which they had in <HI>England,</HI> and pay Cu&s;tomes as forraingers for all they &s;pend in <HI>Ireland,</HI> whither they were &s;ent for the Honour and Benefit of <HI>Eng|land.</HI></P>
<P>The third impediment is that <HI>Ireland</HI> be|ing a conquered Country, and containing not the Tenth part of as many <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Ma&s;tives as there are <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in both Kingdoms, that natural and firm Union is not made between the two Peoples by Tran&s;plantation and proportionable Mixture, &s;o as there may be a Tenth part of <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the &s;ame Proportion in <HI>England,</HI> whereby the nece&s;&s;ity of maintaining an Army in <HI>England</HI> at the expence of the quarter of all the Rents of that Kingdom may be taken away.</P>
<P>The fourth impediment is that the Taxes in <HI>England</HI> are not levied upon the expen|ces,
<PB N="80" REF="375">
but the whole E&s;tate, not upon Lands, Stock and Labour, but chiefly upon Land alone, and that not by any equal and indifferent Standard, but the ca&s;ual Predo|minacy of Parties and Factions; and moreo|ver that the&s;e Taxes are not levied with the lea&s;t trouble and charge, but let out to Far|mers, who al&s;o let them from one to ano|ther without explicit knowledge of what they do, but &s;o are to conclude the poor people pay twice as much as the King re|ceives.</P>
<P>Now the fifth impediment is the inequa|lity of Shires, Dioce&s;&s;es, Pari&s;hes, Church-livings, and other Precincts, as al&s;o of the Repre&s;entations of the people in Parliament, all which do hinder the operations of Au|thority, in the &s;ame manner as a Wheel irregularly made, and excentrically hung neither moves &s;o ea&s;ily, nor performs it's work &s;o timely, as if the &s;ame were duly framed and poi&s;ed.</P>
<P N="6">6. Whether it be an impediment that the Power of making War and rai&s;ing money be not in the &s;ame hand much may be &s;aid; but that I leave to tho&s;e who may more properly meddle with Fundamental Laws. None of the&s;e impediments are natural but did ari&s;e as the irregularities of Buildings do by being built part at one time and
<PB N="81" REF="375">
part at another, and by the changing of the State of things from what they were at the re&s;pective times, when the Practice we com|plained of were fir&s;t admitted, and perhaps are but the warpings from the rectitude of the fir&s;t in&s;titution.</P>
<P>As the&s;e Impediments are contingent &s;o they are al&s;o removable, for may not the Land of Superfluous Territories be &s;old, and the people with their moveables be brought away? may not the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the <HI>American</HI> Plantations who Plant Tobacco, Sugar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> compute what Land will &s;erve their turns, and then contract their Habita|tions to that proportion, for quantity and quality? As for the people of <HI>New England</HI> I can but wi&s;h they were Tran&s;planted in|to old-<HI>England</HI> or <HI>Ireland,</HI> according to Pro|po&s;als of their own, made within this twen|ty Years, altho they were allowed more li|berty of Con&s;cience then they allow one ano|ther.</P>
<P>May not the three Kingdoms be united into one, and equally repre&s;ented in Parlia|ment? might not the &s;everal Species of the Kings Subjects be equally mixt in their ha|bitations? might not Pari&s;hes and other Pre|cincts be better equaliz'd? might not juri&s;|dictions and Pretences of Powers be deter|mined and a&s;certained? might not Taxes be
<PB N="82" REF="376">
equally aplotted and directly applyed, to their ultimate u&s;e? might not di&s;&s;enters in Religion be indulged, they paying a com|petent force to keep the Publick-Peace? I humbly venture to &s;ay all the&s;e things may be done; if it be thought fit by the Sove|raign Power, becau&s;e the like has often and Succesfully been done already at Several Places, and Times.</P>

<P>TO clear this point we are to find out what is the middle Expence of each Head in the Kings Dominions between the highe&s;t and the lowe&s;t; to which I &s;ay it is not probably le&s;s then the Expence of a Labourer, who earns about eight pence a day, for the wages of &s;uch men is four Shillings a Week without Victuals, or two Shillings with it; wherefore the value of his Victuals is two Shillings <HI>per</HI> Week, or five pound four Shillings <HI>per Annum.</HI> Now the value of Cloaths can't be le&s;s then wages given to the Poore&s;t Maid-Servant in the

<P>It is not likely that this Di&s;cour&s;e will fall into the Hands of any that lives at &s;e|ven pound <HI>per Annum</HI>; and therefore &s;uch will wonder at this Suppo&s;ition; but if they con&s;ider how much the number of the Poor and their Children is greater, then that of the Rich, altho the per&s;onal Expence of &s;ome Rich men &s;hould be above twenty times more then that of a Labourer; yet the expence of a Labourer above menti|oned, may well enough &s;tand for the Stan|dard of the expence of the whole Ma&s;s of Mankind.</P>
<P>Now if the expence of each man one with another be &s;even pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> and if the number of the Kings Subjects be Ten thou&s;and; then the tenth part of the whole Expence will be &s;even thou&s;and; but about five thou&s;and, or a very little more will amount to a years pay for one hundred thou|&s;and Foot; forty thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and forty thou&s;and men at Sea, Winter and Summer, which can rarely be nece&s;&s;ary, and other ordinary charge of the Government in the time of deep and &s;ecute peace was not 600000 <HI>per Annum.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. That there are &s;pare Hands enough a|mong&s;t the King of <HI>England</HI>'s Sub|jects to earn two Millions <HI>per An|num</HI> more then they now do, and that there are al&s;o Imployments ready, proper and &s;ufficient, for the purpo&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>TO prove this point, we mu&s;t inquire how much all the People could earn if they were di&s;po&s;ed or nece&s;&s;itated to La|bour, and had work whereupon to imploy them&s;elves, and compare the Summ with that of the Total Expence abovemention|ed; deducting the Rents and profit of their Land and Stock, which properly &s;peaking &s;aveth &s;o much Labour. Now the proceed of the &s;aid Land and Stock in the&s;e Countries is about three parts of &s;even of the whole Expence; &s;o as where the expence is &s;eventy thou&s;and, the Rent of the Land and profit of all Per&s;onal E&s;tate, intere&s;t of money <HI>&amp;c.</HI> mu&s;t be about thirty thou&s;and, and con&s;equently the value of the Labour forty
<PB N="91" REF="380">
thou&s;and; that is, four pound <HI>per</HI> Head; but it is to be noted, that about a quar|ter of the Ma&s;s of Mankind are Children Males and Females under &s;even Years old, from whom little Labour is to be expected; it is al&s;o to be noted that about another tenth part of the whole people are &s;uch as by Rea&s;on of their great E&s;tates, Tythes, Dignities, Offices, and profe&s;&s;ions are ex|empt from that kind of Labour; we now &s;peak of their bu&s;ine&s;s being or ought to be to Govern, Regulate, and direct the La|bours and Actions of others, &s;o that of Ten Millions there be about &s;ix thou&s;and &amp; a half, or two thirds which if need requires might actually Labour, and of the&s;e &s;ome might earn three Shillings a Week, &s;ome five Shil|lings and &s;ome &s;even Shillings, that is, all of them might earn five Shillings a Weak at a <HI>medium</HI> one with another, or at lea&s;t Ten pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> allowing for Sickne&s;s and other Accidents whereby the whole might earn fifty &s;ix thou&s;and pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> that is, twenty five more then the Ex|pence.</P>
<P>The Author of the State of <HI>England</HI> &s;aies that the Children of <HI>Norwich</HI> between &s;ix and &s;ixteen Years old do earn twelve thou&s;and pound <HI>per Annum</HI> more then they &s;pend. Now for as much as the people of <HI>Norwich</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="381">
are a three hundredth part of all the peo|ple in <HI>England</HI> (as appears by the Accompt of Hearth-money) and about the five hundredth part of all the Kings Subjects throughout the World, it follows that all his Maje&s;ties Subjects between &s;ix and &s;ix|teen Years old might earn five thou&s;and <HI>per Annum</HI> more then they &s;pend. Again forasmuch as the number of People above &s;ixteen Years old are double the number of tho&s;e between &s;ix and &s;ixteen, and that of each men can earn double to each of the Children, it is plain that if the men and Children every where did do as they do in <HI>Norwich</HI> they might earn twenty five thou|&s;and pound <HI>per Annum</HI> more then they &s;pend; which e&s;timate grounded upon matter of Fact and Experience, agrees with the for|mer.</P>
<P>Altho as has been proved the people of <HI>England</HI> do thrive, and that 'tis po&s;&s;ible they might Superlucrate twenty five thou&s;and pound <HI>per Annum,</HI> yet 'tis manife&s;t they do not nor twenty three which is le&s;s by two thou&s;and herein meant; for if they did Su|perlucrate twenty five thou&s;and, then in a|bout five or &s;ix Years time the whole Stock and Per&s;onal E&s;tate of the Nation would be double, which I wi&s;h were true, but find no manner of Rea&s;on to believe; where|fore
<PB N="93" REF="381">
if they can Superlucrate twenty five, but not actually Superlucrate twenty three, nor twenty, nor ten, nor perhaps five, I have then proved what was propounded, <HI>viz.</HI> that there are &s;pare hands among the Kings Subjects to earn two Millions more then they now do.</P>
<P>But to &s;peak a little more particularly concerning this matter, it is to be noted, that &s;ince the fire of <HI>London,</HI> there was earned in four Years by Trade&s;men (re|lating to building only) the Summ of four Millions, or one Million <HI>per Annum</HI> with|out le&s;&s;ening any other &s;ort of Work La|bour or Manufacture, which was u&s;ually done in other four Years before the &s;aid occa&s;ion; but if the Trade&s;men relating to Building only, and &s;uch of them as wrought in and about <HI>London</HI> could do one Milli|on-worth of Work extraordinary, I think that from thence and from what has been &s;aid before, that all the re&s;t of the &s;pare Hands might very well double the &s;ame, which is as much as was propounded. Now if there were &s;pare Hands to Superlucrate Millions of Millions, they &s;ignifie nothing un|le&s;s there were Imployment for them, &amp; may as well follow their Plea&s;ures and Specu|lation as Labour to no purpo&s;e; therefore the more material point is to prove that
<PB N="94" REF="382">
there is two Millionsw-orth of Work to be done, which at the pre&s;ent the Kings Subjects do neglect.</P>

<P>NOw for the further Incouragement of Trade, as we have &s;hewn, that there is Money enough in <HI>England</HI> to manage the affairs thereof, &s;o we &s;hall now offer to con|&s;ideration whether there be not competent and convenient Stock to drive the Trade of the whole commercial World. To which purpo&s;e it is to be remembred, that all the Commodities yearly exported out of every part of the la&s;t mentioned World, may be bought for forty five Millions, and that the Shipping imployed in the &s;ame World are not worth above fifteen Millions, and con|&s;equently that &s;ixty Millions at mo&s;t will drive the whole Trade abovementioned without any tru&s;t at all; but forasmuch as the Grovers of Commodities do commonly tru&s;t them to &s;uch Merchants or Factors as are worth but &s;uch a part of the
<PB N="98" REF="384">
full value of their Commodities as may po&s;&s;ibly be lo&s;t upon the &s;ail of them which is rather to be expected; it follows then le&s;s then a Stock of &s;ixty Millions, nay then half of the &s;aid Summ is &s;ufficient to drive the Trade above mentioned; it being well known that any Trade&s;emen of good Reputation worth five hundred pound will be tru&s;ted with above one thou&s;and pounds-worth of Commodities, where le&s;s then thir|ty Millions will &s;uffice for the &s;aid purpo&s;e, of which Summ the Coyn, Shipping and Stock already in Trade do at lea&s;t make one half.</P>
<P>And it has been &s;hewn how by the Poli|cy of a Bank any Summ of money may be made equivalent in Trade unto near the double of the &s;ame. By all which it &s;eems that even at pre&s;ent much is not wanting to perform what is propounded; but &s;up|po&s;e twenty thou&s;and or more were want|ing, it is not improbable that &s;ince the ge|nerality of Gentlemen and &s;ome Noble-men do put their Younger Sons to Merchandi&s;e, that they will &s;ee it rea&s;onable as they in|crea&s;e in the number of Merchants &s;o to in|crea&s;e the Magnitude of Trade, and con&s;e|quently to increa&s;e Stock; which may effectu|ally be done by in-banking twenty Mil. worth of Land not being above a &s;ixth or &s;eventh part of the whole Territories of <HI>England,</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="384">
that is to &s;ay, by making a Bond of &s;uch value, to the &s;ecurity for all Commodi|ties bought and &s;old, upon the account of that Univer&s;al Trade above menti|oned.</P>
