<HEAD>A Brief DESCRIPTION OF <HI>The</HI> PROVINCE of <HI>CAROLINA,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>CAROLINA</HI> is a fair and &s;pacious Province on the Continent of <HI>America:</HI> &s;o called in honour of His Sacred Maje&s;ty that now is, <HI>Charles the Second,</HI> whom God pre&s;erve; and His Maje&s;ty hath been pleas'd to grant the &s;ame to certain Honourable Per&s;ons, who in order to the &s;peedy planting of the &s;ame, have granted di|vers privileges and advantages to &s;uch as &s;hall tran&s;port them&s;elves and Servants in convenient time; This Pro|vince lying &s;o neer <HI>Virginia,</HI> and yet more Southward, enjoys the fertility and advantages thereof; and yet is &s;o far di&s;tant, as to be freed from the incon&s;tancy of the Weather, which is a great cau&s;e of the unhealthfulne&s;s thereof; al&s;o, being in the latitude of the <HI>Barmoodoes</HI> may expect the like healthfulne&s;s which it hath hitherto en|joy'd, and doubtle&s;s there is no Plantation that ever the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> went upon, in all re&s;pects &s;o good as this: for though <HI>Barmoodoes</HI> be wonderful healthy and fruitful, yet is it but a Pri&s;on to the Inhabitants, who are much
<PB N="2" REF="3"><!-- PDF PAGE 55 -->&s;treightned for want of room, and therefore many of them are come to <HI>Carolina,</HI> and more intend to follow. There is &s;eated in this Province two Colonies already, one on the River <HI>Roanoak</HI> (now called <HI>Albemarle</HI> River) and borders on <HI>Virginia;</HI> the Other at <HI>Cape Feare,</HI> two Degrees more Southerly; of which follows a more perti|cular De&s;cription.</P>
<P>This Province of <HI>Carolina</HI> is &s;ituate on the main Con|tinent of <HI>America,</HI> between the degrees of 30. and 36. and hath on the North the South part of <HI>Virginia;</HI> on the South is bounded by the 30 degree of Latitude not yet fully di&s;covered; on the Ea&s;t is <HI>Mare Atlanticum,</HI> part of the great Ocean; and on the We&s;t the wealthy South Sea is its Confines.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The perticular De&s;cription of <HI>Cape-Feare.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of this fertile Province, in the Latitude of 34 degrees, there is a Colony of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;eated, who Landed there the 29 of <HI>May, Anno</HI> 1664. and are in all about 800 per&s;ons, who have overcome all the diffi|culties that attend the fir&s;t attempts, and have cleered the way for tho&s;e that come after, who will find good hou&s;es to be in whil&s;t their own are in building; good forts to &s;ecure them from their enemies; and many things brought from other parts there increa&s;ing to their no &s;mall advantage. The entrance into the River, now called <HI>Cape-Feare</HI> River, the &s;ituation of the Cape, and trending of the Land, is plainly laid down to the eye in the Map annexed. The River is barred at the entrance,
<PB N="3" REF="3"><!-- PDF PAGE 55 -->but there is a Channel clo&s;e abord the Cape that will con|vey in &s;afety a &s;hip of 300 Tons, and as &s;oon as a &s;hip is over the Bar, the River is 5 or 6 fathom deep for a 100 miles from the Sea; this Bar is a great &s;ecurity to the Colony again&s;t a forreign Inva&s;ion, the channel be|ing hard to find by tho&s;e that have not experience of it, and yet &s;afe enough to tho&s;e that know it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The Earth, Water, and Air.</HEAD>
<P>THe Land is of divers &s;orts as in all Countryes of the world, that which lyes neer the Sea, is &s;andy and barren, but beareth many tall Trees, which make good timber for &s;everal u&s;es; and this &s;andy ground is by ex|perienced men thought to be one cau&s;e of the healthful|ne&s;s of the place: but up the River about 20 or 30 mile, where they have made a Town, called <HI>Charles</HI>-Town, there is plenty of as rich ground as any in the world; It is a blacki&s;h mold upon a red &s;and, and under that a clay, but in &s;ome places is rich ground of a grayer colour, they have made Brick of the Clay, which proves very good; and Lime they have al&s;o for building. The whole Coun|try con&s;i&s;ts of &s;tately Woods, Groves, Mar&s;hes and Meadows; it abounds with variety of as brave Okes as Eye can behold, great Bodies tall and &s;treight from 60 to 80 foot, before there be any Boughs, which with the little under-wood makes the Woods very commodious to travel in, either on Hor&s;e-back or a foot. In the barren &s;andy ground grow mo&s;t &s;tately <HI>Pines,</HI> white and red <HI>Cedars, A&s;h, Birch, Holly, Che&s;nut,</HI> and <HI>Walnut-trees</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="4"><!-- PDF PAGE 56 -->of great growth and very plentiful: There are many &s;orts of fruit Trees, as <HI>Vines, Medlaas, Peach, Wild Cherries, Mulbury-Trees,</HI> and the <HI>Silk-worm</HI> breed|ing naturally on them, with many other Trees for Fruit and for Building, for Perfume and for Me|dicine, for which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> have no name; al&s;o &s;e|veral &s;orts of Dying Stuff, which may prove of great advantage; The Woods are &s;tored with Deer and Wild Turkeys, of a great magnitude, weighing many times above 50 <HI>l.</HI> a piece, and of a more plea&s;ant ta&s;t than in <HI>England,</HI> being in their proper climate; other &s;orts of Bea&s;ts in the Woods that are good for food; and al&s;o Fowls, who&s;e names are not known to them. This is what they found naturally upon the place; but they have brought with them mo&s;t &s;orts of &s;eeds and roots of the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> which thrive very well, and they have <HI>Potatoes,</HI> and the other Roots and Herbs of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> growing and thriving with them; as al&s;o from <HI>Virginia, Barmoodoes,</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> what they could afford: They have <HI>Indico, Tobacco</HI> very good, and <HI>Cotton-wool; Lime-trees, Orange, Lemon,</HI> and other Fruit-Trees they brought thrive exceed|ingly: They have two Crops of <HI>Indian</HI>-Corn in one year, and great increa&s;e every Crop; <HI>Apples, Pears,</HI> and other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> fruit, grow there out of the plan|ted Kernels: The Mar&s;hes and Meadows are very large from 1500 to 3000 Acres, and upwards, and are excellent food for Cattle, and will bear any Grain be|ing prepared; &s;ome Cattle both great and &s;mall, which live well all the Winter, and keep their fat without Fodder; Hogs find &s;o much Ma&s;t and other Food
<PB N="5" REF="4"><!-- PDF PAGE 56 -->in the Woods, that they want no other care than a Swine-herd to keep them from running wild. The Meadows are very proper for <HI>Rice, Rape-&s;eed, Lin|&s;eed,</HI> &amp;c. and may many of them be made to over|flow at plea&s;ure with a &s;mall charge. Here are as brave Rivers as any in the World, &s;tored with great abundance of <HI>Sturgeon, Salmon, Ba&s;&s;e, Plaice, Trout,</HI> and <HI>Lpani&s;h Mackrill;</HI> with many other mo&s;t plea&s;ant &s;orts of Fi&s;h, both flat and round, for which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue hath no name. Al&s;o in the little Win|ter they have abundance of <HI>Wild Gee&s;e, Ducks, Teals, Widgeons,</HI> and many other plea&s;ant fowl; and (as is &s;aid before) the Rivers are very deep and naviga|ble above 100 miles up; al&s;o there are whol&s;ome Springs and Rivulets. La&s;t of all, the Air comes to be con&s;idered, which is not the lea&s;t con&s;iderable to the well being of a Plantation, for without a whol|&s;om Air all other con&s;iderations avail nothing; and this is it which makes this Place &s;o de&s;ireable, being &s;eated in the mo&s;t temperate Clime, where the neigh|bour-hood of the glorious Light of Heaven brings many advantages, and his convenient di&s;tance &s;ecures them from the Inconvenience of his &s;cortching beams. The Summer is not too hot, and the Winter is very &s;hort and moderate, be&s;t agreeing with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Con|&s;titutions. <HI>Cape-Feare</HI> lyes about 34 degrees from the Equator, the Nights nor Days are &s;o long when at longe&s;t as in <HI>England,</HI> by &s;omewhat above two hours. A remarkable In&s;tance of the Healthfulne&s;s of the Place, is, That at the fir&s;t &s;etting down of the Colo|ny, when they had no hou&s;e nor harbour, but wrought
<PB N="6" REF="5"><!-- PDF PAGE 57 -->hard all day, in preparing Wood to build, and lay in the open Air all night, yet not one of them was ill, but continued well all the time; they Sympa|thize mo&s;t with the <HI>Barmoodoes,</HI> which is the health|fulle&s;t &s;pot in the World, and yet the la&s;t year they had a Feaver and Ague that troubled them much, which al&s;o was at <HI>Cape-Feare,</HI> but was not dangerous to any that took care of them&s;elves, and had things convenient. This place had been aimed at many years &s;ince. Sir <HI>Walter Rawleigh</HI> had a de&s;ign to have plan|ted it. Tho&s;e of the <HI>Barmoodoes,</HI> who&s;e Habitations are too &s;treight for them, have with longing de&s;ire waited for the di&s;covery of this place that is neer their own Latitude, where they may expect the &s;ame healthfulne&s;s they do now enjoy, which is now per|fected as to the fir&s;t Settlement, and wants nothing but a diligent pro&s;ecution of &s;o noble an Enterprize.</P>
<P>If therefore any indu&s;trious and ingenious per&s;ons &s;hall be willing to pertake of the Felicites of this Country, let them imbrace the fir&s;t opportunity, that they may obtain the greater advantages.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>The chief of the Privileges are as follows.</HEAD>
<P>Fir&s;t, There is full and free Liberty of Con&s;cience granted to all, &s;o that no man is to be mole&s;ted or called in que&s;tion for matters of Religious Concern; but every one to be obedient to the Civil Govern|ment, wor&s;hipping God after their own way.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="5"><!-- PDF PAGE 57 -->
Secondly, There is freedom from Cu&s;tom for all <HI>Wine, Silk, Rai&s;ins, Currance, Oyl, Olives,</HI> and <HI>Al|monds,</HI> that &s;hall be rai&s;ed in the Province for 7. years, after 4 Ton of any of tho&s;e commodities &s;hall be imported in one Bottom.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Every Free-man and Free-woman that tran&s;port them&s;elves and Servants by the 25 of <HI>March</HI> next, being 1667. &s;hall have for Him&s;elf, Wife, Children, and Men-&s;ervants, for each 100 Acres of Land for him and his Heirs for ever, and for every Woman-&s;ervant and Slave 50 Acres, paying at mo&s;t &frac12;<HI>d. per acre, per annum,</HI> in lieu of all demands, to the Lords Proprietors: Provided always, That every Man be armed with a good Mu&s;quet full bore, 10 <HI>l.</HI> Powder, and 20 <HI>l.</HI> of Bullet, and &s;ix Months Pro|vi&s;ion for all, to &s;erve them whil&s;t they rai&s;e Provi|&s;ion in that Countrey.</P>
<P>Fourthly, Every Man-Servant at the expiration of their time, is to have of the Country a 100 Acres of Land to him and his heirs for ever, paying only &frac12;<HI>d. per Acre, per annum,</HI> and the Women 50. Acres of Land on the &s;ame conditions; their Ma&s;ters al&s;o are to al|low them two Suits of Apparrel and Tools &s;uch as he is be&s;t able to work with, according to the Cu&s;tom of the Countrey.</P>
<P>Fifthly, They are to have a Governour and Coun|cil appointed from among them&s;elves, to &s;ee the Laws of the A&s;&s;embly put in due execution; but the Go|vernour
<PB N="8" REF="6"><!-- PDF PAGE 58 -->is to rule but 3 years, and then learn to obey; al&s;o he hath no power to lay any Tax, or make or abrogate any Law, without the Con&s;ent of the Colony in their A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Sixthly, They are to choo&s;e annually from among them&s;elves, a certain Number of Men, according to their divi&s;ions, which con&s;titute the General A&s;&s;em|bly with the Governour and his Council, and have the &s;ole power of Making Laws, and Laying Taxes for the common good when need &s;hall require.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the chief and Fundamental Privileges, but the Right Honourable Lords Proprietors have pro|mi&s;ed (and it is their Intere&s;t &s;o to do) to be ready to grant what other Privileges may be found advan|tageous for the good, of the Colony.</P>
<P>Is there therefore any younger Brother who is born of Gentile blood, and who&s;e Spirit is elevated above the common &s;ort, and yet the hard u&s;age of our Country hath not allowed &s;uitable fortune; he will not &s;urely be afraid to leave his Native Soil to ad|vance his Fortunes equal to his Blood and Spirit, and &s;o he will avoid tho&s;e unlawful ways too many of our young Gentlemen take to maintain them&s;elves ac|cording to their high education, having but &s;mall E|&s;tates; here, with a few Servants and a &s;mall Stock a great E&s;tate may be rai&s;ed, although his Birth have not entituled him to any of the Land of his Ance|&s;tors, yet his Indu&s;try may &s;upply him &s;o, as to make him the head of as famous a family.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="6"><!-- PDF PAGE 58 -->
Such as are here tormented with much care how to get worth to gain a Livelyhood, or that with their labour can hardly get a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, &s;hall do well to go to this place, where any man what-ever, that is but willing to take moderate pains, may be a&s;&s;ured of a mo&s;t comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, and be in a way to rai&s;e his fortunes far beyond what he could ever hope for in <HI>England.</HI> Let no man be troubled at the thoughts of being a Servant for 4 or 5 year, for I can a&s;&s;ure you, that many men give mony with their children to &s;erve 7 years, to take more pains and fare nothing &s;o well as the Servants in this Plantation will do. Then it is to be con&s;ide|red, that &s;o &s;oon as he is out of his time, he hath Land, and Tools, and Clothes given him, and is in a way of advancement. Therefore all Artificers, as <HI>Carpenters, Wheel-rights, Joyners, Coopers, Bricklayers, Smiths,</HI> or diligent Husbandmen and Labourers, that are willing to advance their fortunes, and live in a mo&s;t plea&s;ant healthful and fruitful Country, where Artificers are of high e&s;teem, and u&s;ed with all Ci|vility and Courte&s;ie imaginable, may take notice, that</P>
<P>There is an opportunity offers now by the <HI>Virginia</HI> Fleet, from whence <HI>Cape Feare</HI> is but 3 or 4 days &s;ail, and then a &s;mall Stock carried to <HI>Virginia</HI> will purcha&s;e provi&s;ions at a far ea&s;ier rate than to carry them from hence; al&s;o the freight of the &s;aid Pro|vi&s;ions will be &s;aved, and be more fre&s;h, and there wanteth not conveyance from <HI>Virginia</HI> thither.</P>
<P>If any Maid or &s;ingle Woman have a de&s;ire to go over, they will think them&s;elves in the Golden Age,
<PB N="10" REF="7"><!-- PDF PAGE 59 -->when Men paid a Dowry for their Wives; for if they be but Civil, and under 50 years of Age, &s;ome hone&s;t Man or other, will purcha&s;e them for their Wives.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e that de&s;ire further advice, or Servants that would be entertained, let them repair to Mr. <HI>Matthew Wilkin&s;on, Ironmonger,</HI> at the Sign of the <HI>Three Fea|thers</HI> in <HI>Bi&s;hop&s;gate-&s;treet,</HI> where they may be inform|ed when the Ships will be ready, and what they mu&s;t carry with them.</P>
<P>Thus much was convenient to be written at pre|&s;ent, but a more ample Relation is intended to be publi&s;hed in due time.</P>
