<HEAD>A PROJECT OF Conditions of Peace.</HEAD>
<P>_HIs Maje&s;ties inviolable fide|lity in adhering to his Alliances, hath induced him never to li&s;ten to any Propo&s;als of Peace, other than &s;uch as &s;hall give a full and perfect &s;atis|faction to the King of <HI>Sueden:</HI> which likewi&s;e having been ab&s;olutely promi&s;ed to his Maje&s;ty by the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> who was earne&s;t to gain this point, both for him and for the <HI>States General;</HI> he now likewi&s;e makes it the fir&s;t Article that he in|&s;i&s;ts upon, and without which he cannot come to any conclu&s;ion upon the re&s;t.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e the Intere&s;t of the Duke of <HI>Got|torp</HI> is &s;o united to that of <HI>Sueden,</HI> that it makes a part of the Treaty of <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> for the performance of which, his Maje&s;ty gave his Garranty
<PB N="2" REF="8"> to that Crown; his Maje&s;ty de&s;ires, that he may now likewi&s;e be comprehended within this Treaty, upon &s;uch terms as &s;hall be &s;atisfactory to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>As for the Prince and Bi&s;hop of <HI>Strasburgh,</HI> the King doth preci&s;ely in&s;i&s;t upon the re&s;titution of that Prince, and of all his Family, to all their E&s;tates, Goods Honours, and Prerogatives; and particularly upon the re&s;titution of his Brother Prince <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Fur&s;temburg:</HI> who&s;e Liberty mu&s;t be provided for by one of the fir&s;t Articles of the Peace.</P>
<P>For what concerns the Empire, as his Maje&s;ty doth &s;till continue in the &s;ame intention which he has expre&s;&s;ed for its Peace, that he has been troubled to &s;ee it di&s;turbed; that it was with much trouble of mind he found him&s;elf compelled to carry the War thither; &s;o he does yet adhere to the&s;e publick Declarations, which he has &s;o often made, That he will in&s;i&s;t onely upon the re&s;toring of the Treaties of <HI>We&s;tphalia</HI> in all their points, and to have them once more to be the means of re&s;toring Peace to <HI>Germany</HI> Which induces him to offer this Alternative to the Emperor; Either that the Emperor &s;hall re|&s;tore <HI>Philipsburg,</HI> and have <HI>Friburg</HI> re&s;tored to him; or el&s;e keep <HI>Philipsburg,</HI> and let his Maje&s;ty continue in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Friburg,</HI> without making any the lea&s;t alteration in the other matters con|tained in the &s;aid Treaties.</P>
<P>As for what concerns <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;ince its Intere&s;t appears to be the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in this War, and both <HI>England, Holland,</HI> and &s;ome E&s;tates bordering upon <HI>Flanders</HI> have further expre&s;s'd their de&s;ire, that that Crown &s;hould retain &s;uch a Frontier in the <HI>Low-Countreys,</HI> as might be able to make that a Bar, which they judge is &s;o very important to their &s;afety; his Maje&s;ty has
<PB N="3" REF="8"> been plea&s;ed, at the in&s;tance of the King of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to agree to the means for the &s;etling it. And upon this con&s;ideration it is, as his Maje&s;ty declared him&s;elf to that Prince, that he has offered already, and doth yet offer to re&s;tore to <HI>Spain</HI> tho&s;e following Places, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P>The Place of <HI>Charleroy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Limburg,</HI> and its Appurtenances.</P>
<P><HI>Binch,</HI> and the Provo&s;t&s;hip thereof.</P>

<P><HI>Oudenard,</HI> and its Cha&s;tellany there.</P>
<P><HI>Courtray,</HI> and its Cha&s;tellany; the Verge of <HI>Me|nin</HI> onely excepted.</P>
<P><HI>Gand,</HI> and its dependances.</P>
<P>St. <HI>Guillain;</HI> but with its Fortifications ra&s;ed.</P>
<P>For &s;o many Places of importance, and which his Maje&s;ty has taken &s;o much care, and been at &s;o great expence to Fortifie; he requires in exchange, that the King of <HI>Spain</HI> quit his right to tho&s;e Places which his Maje&s;ty hath po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of in this la&s;t War.</P>
<P>All <HI>Franche Compte.</HI></P>
<P>The Town of <HI>Valenciennes,</HI> and its Dependances.</P>

<P><HI>Poperingue, Bailleul,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;el,</HI> with their De|pendances.</P>
<P>In a word, that he quit his Right to all &s;uch Places and Countreys as his Maje&s;ty hath now in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; excepting tho&s;e before mentioned,
<PB N="4" REF="9"> which his Maje&s;ty is willing to re&s;tore to <HI>Spain;</HI> The Town of <HI>Charlemont,</HI> or in lieu thereof, the Towns of <HI>Dinant</HI> and <HI>Bouvines;</HI> upon condition that he, at the choice of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> will charge him&s;elf, that the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Liege</HI> &s;hall quit his right to <HI>Dinant,</HI> and that the Emperor and Empire &s;hall give their a&s;&s;ent thereunto. By this means the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Frontier in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> would for the future begin from the Sea, to the <HI>Meu&s;e, Newport, Dixmude, Courtray, Oudenard, Aeth, Mons, Charleroy,</HI> and <HI>Namur.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Articles which concern the <HI>States General,</HI> they are &s;o very favourable, that they cannot but conclude, that his Maje&s;ty doth fully purpo&s;e to receive them into the former Friend|&s;hip, after the Peace &s;hall be concluded.

<P>And to the end his Maje&s;ty may give the World the utmo&s;t te&s;timony of his &s;incere intentions for the Peace, his Maje&s;ty, notwith&s;tanding any rea&s;on that might induce him to continue in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Lorrain,</HI> is willing that Prince <HI>Charles</HI> be re&s;tored to it, upon one of the&s;e two Alternatives, of which he gives him his choice.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That he be re&s;tored according to the Arti|cles expre&s;&s;ed in the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty, without any change or alteration in any of them.</P>
<P>Or &s;econdly, That he be re&s;tored generally to his whole E&s;tate, except the Town of <HI>Nancy,</HI> which his Maje&s;ty will retain, with plenary Right of So|vereignty, and excepting &s;uch a way as was agreed upon at the Treaty of 1661. to pa&s;s from the Fron|tiers
<PB N="5" REF="9"> of <HI>France</HI> into <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> and all &s;uch ways as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Nancy;</HI> and from <HI>Nancy</HI> to <HI>Metz, Bri&s;ac,</HI> and <HI>Franche Compte;</HI> upon condition neverthele&s;s, that to make him &s;ome compen&s;ation for the Town of <HI>Nancy,</HI> his Maje&s;ty &s;hall re&s;ign to him that of <HI>Toul,</HI> con|&s;iderable for its extent and &s;ituation, and much more in re&s;pect of its Bi&s;hoprick.</P>
<P>His Maje&s;ty demands likewi&s;e, that <HI>Long-Wic</HI> and its Provo&s;t&s;hip be quitted to him: but offereth withall to recompen&s;e the Prince of <HI>Lorrain</HI> with another provo&s;t&s;hip of equal value within one of the three Bi&s;hopricks.

<P>The&s;e are the Terms which may, and ought to make the Platform of a General Peace, and upon which his Maje&s;ty hath long ago declared him&s;elf to the King of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> His Maje&s;ty de&s;ires that they may be imparted to the A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Ni|meguen;</HI> and that his own Plenipotentiaries there propo&s;e them to the con&s;ideration of the re&s;t, as con|taining the lowe&s;t Conditions that he can admit; and upon which his Enemies may make choice either of War or Peace.</P>

We are glad to under&s;tand, that the terms which we propo&s;ed at that A&s;&s;embly appear to you to be rea|&s;onable, and that you are fully per&s;waded of the &s;incerity of our mind, in a matter of &s;o great im|portance: And it is with the greater fatis&s;action to our &s;elves, that we confirm the &s;ame unto you by this Letter; becau&s;e notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e ad|vantages which we have already acquir'd by our Arms, and may ju&s;tly hope for by the pro&s;ecution of the War; yet we place our chiefe&s;t glory in making all the &s;teps we can towards a Peace. But becau&s;e it appears by the Di&s;cour&s;es that have been made to our Plenipotentiaries by your order, that how de&s;irous &s;oever you are to conclude the Peace, yet there remains &s;ome &s;cruple with you concerning the Seventh Article of the Treaty of Commerce, which has been debated at</HI> Nimeguen <HI>between our Am|ba&s;&s;adors
<PB N="7" REF="10"> and yours; and trouble of mind, le&s;t we &s;hould make an entire Conque&s;t of the</HI> Low-Countreys, <HI>in ca&s;e</HI> Spain <HI>&s;hould reject the Terms we have offered, we are willing to impart our thoughts unto you upon tho&s;e two Points. We cannot do it more favourably, as to the fir&s;t of them, than by granting, that the Seventh Article &s;hould be as your &s;elves de&s;ire it. And in taking &s;uch mea&s;ures with you upon the &s;econd Point, as may ea&s;e you of the fear you expre&s;s for the lo&s;s of</HI> Flanders. <HI>And this we will then do, when</HI> Spain <HI>having refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to the Peace, there &s;hall be a Treaty con|cluded between us and you, upon &s;uch Terms as have been already propos'd with relation to your &s;elves, and that you &s;hall have returned to our Alliance, and &s;hall oblige your &s;elves to continue Neuters during the War. We &s;hall be always ready for your &s;akes to grant to</HI> Spain <HI>the &s;ame Terms, with rela|tion to</HI> Flanders, <HI>which they are at liberty now to accept: And we are further willing to a&s;&s;ure you, that in all that time we will not Attaque any one Place in tho&s;e Provinces. Thus you &s;hall always find us readily inclined, not onely to form that Bar which you think &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for your own &s;afety, but to &s;ecure it; and to let you enjoy, together with the re|e&s;tabli&s;hment of Commerce, what|ever other advantages you can expect from our Friend&s;hip. And if for the pro&s;ecuting this Ne|gotiation you &s;hall think it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end Depu|ties to us, they will find us near</HI> Ghent <HI>till the 27th. day of this Month, and in the &s;ame di&s;po|&s;itions we have declared to you in this Letter.

The condition in which his Maje&s;ties Arms are at pre&s;ent, and the favou|rable opportunity that would be lo&s;t in deferring their acting, would not permit him to con&s;ent to this Propo&s;al, if the de&s;ire to give Peace to</HI> Europe, <HI>did not much more prevail in him, than that of enlarging his Frontiers by new Conque&s;ts. It is in this con&s;ideration to contribute to the Publick Re|po&s;e, that he will agree, at the de&s;ire of the &s;aid States General, to a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms for &s;ix weeks, to begin the fir&s;t day of the next month, &s;uch an one as was &s;tipulated between</HI> France <HI>and</HI> Spain <HI>in the year 1668.

<P>THe Amba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary, and Plenipoten|tiary of his Maje&s;ty the King of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> at the Treaty of Peace held at <HI>Ni|meguen;</HI> hath &s;een by the communication which the Deputies of the States General of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> have made to the Mini&s;ters of the Con|federates at the <HI>Hague,</HI> what his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to Order the delivery of in writ|ing to his Excellency the Sieur <HI>de Beverning</HI> their Amba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary, as well touching his con|&s;ent to a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms for Six weeks, as concern|ing his demand of a promi&s;e from the States General, that in ca&s;e they &s;hall not be able during that Ce&s;&s;a|tion, to prevail with their Allies to accept of &s;uch Terms as his Maje&s;ty hath offered, that then they will no longer A&s;&s;i&s;t them directly or indirectly, again&s;t him or his Allies during the continuance of the War; And having thereupon con&s;idered what he conceives is fit and nece&s;&s;ary for the Kind his Ma&s;ter to do upon occa&s;&s;ion of his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ties &s;aid agreement and demand; He thinks it his duty to repre&s;ent to their Excellencies, the Amba&s;&s;adors Extraordinary, and Plenipotentiaries of the High Allies at this Congre&s;s, that pre&s;uppo&s;ing, which he does without any doubt, the con&s;tancy and re|&s;olution of the States General, wherewith they have always hitherto maintain'd the Credit and Ho|nour of their Treaties, which is the true band and mo&s;t proper &s;upport of a free Common-wealth, That they will not do any thing that may ca&s;t the lea&s;t
<PB N="17" REF="15"> blemi&s;h upon the Reputation which they have hither|to honourably accquired and maintain'd, His Maje&s;ty a&s;&s;ures him&s;elf that in this juncture, they will not &s;et one &s;tep to the Prejudice of tho&s;e mutual engage|ments that are betwixt him&s;elf and them: in di&s;charge of which he has vouch&s;afed to hazard his own &s;acred Per&s;on, and the choice&s;t blood of his Subjects, to the expence of what the utmo&s;t of the revenue of all his Kingdoms and E&s;tates would amount to. Every one may remember into what extremity of Affairs his Maje&s;ty was willing, when reque&s;ted, to throw him&s;elf in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e Calamities, that then oppre&s;&s;ed the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> and &s;ome of the Confederates, with intention to deliver them from the ruine that threatned them, and to take part with them in their mo&s;t dangerous Events: What cour&s;e he took to effect this, and the benefit which has accrewed by his Engaging in it, both to the common cau&s;e of all the Confederates, and to their Hi. and Mi. the States General of the <HI>United Provinces</HI> in particular, is &s;ufficiently known to all the World: &s;o that it would be to no purpo&s;e to make a repetation of them here. A &s;ure and honourable Peace is what every one now aims at: For the obtaining whereof, if the mutual engage|ments which the Confederates &s;tand in one to ano|ther, continue in force, we ought to Treat upon terms, and not take them ready made to our hands. It has been demon&s;trated more then once by preg|nant and undeniable Arguments and Rea&s;ons, that a Ce&s;&s;ation of Arms mu&s;t needs come attended with many great mi&s;chiefs and inconveniences: if there are more cogent Arguments why the States Ge|neral of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> in re&s;pect of their own Affairs in particular, and the concerns of &s;uch
<PB N="18" REF="16"> who&s;e intere&s;t is the &s;ame with theirs, &s;hould ac|cept of a Truce with <HI>France,</HI> we may well hope at lea&s;t that that con&s;ideration will not be thought &s;ufficient to oblige others, who&s;e Affairs are in quit different circum&s;tances, to come into the Truce likewi&s;e: And that they will &s;o qualifie the condi|tions of their Truce, as that what makes for the advantage of one part of the Allies, may not be to the utter ruine of all the re&s;t; though the Arms of <HI>France</HI> are attended with a &s;trange current of Succe&s;s, yet the faithfulne&s;s of which the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King makes profe&s;&s;ion, in adhering to his Allies, ought not to triumph over their con&s;tancy, whom common intere&s;t has linked together in a &s;acred bond for their mutual pre&s;ervation. This vertue will make them re&s;pected even among their enemies; whereas the contrary would bla&s;t all their Reputations, and lead them one by one into Calamities, which they would di&s;cover the cau&s;e of too late, when the effects would be remedile&s;s. His Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty has given the States General a very &s;hort time to declare them&s;elves upon the contents of his Memorial, the fore&s;ight of his Councel &s;aw very well, that the time would be too &s;hort for all the parties concern'd to be well advi&s;ed: and we may ea&s;ily judge with what de&s;ign the matter was &s;o Ordered: But if we mu&s;t take the things as they are, and make the be&s;t we can of them, we may certainly a&s;&s;ure our &s;elves that their Hi. and Mi. will not &s;horten the time, but will allow their Friends as large a Term as their Enemies have allowed them: and that they will not precipitate them&s;elves into &s;uch re&s;olutions as the events that half a day may produce, may likely make them repent of their forwardne&s;s in taking up
<PB N="19" REF="16"> But above all things his Maje&s;ty aforementioned, and his &s;aid Amba&s;&s;ador Extraordinary, in his name and on his behalf doth mo&s;t earne&s;tly entreat their Excellencies the Amba&s;&s;adors Extraordinary of their Highne&s;&s;es, that they will interpo&s;e to the ut|mo&s;t of their power, and make u&s;e of the credit that they have with the States General their Ma&s;ters, to prevent their putting them&s;elves out of all po&s;&s;ibility of doing any thing for tho&s;e that have done all for them (which power our Enemies re&s;erved to them&s;elves, for the &s;akes of &s;uch as have not contributed at all or but very incon&s;ide|rably to the putting them into the condition in which now they are in) and that at lea&s;t they will continue a readine&s;s of mind to do what may be in their power, though they &s;hould happen to be de&s;titute of &s;uch means as might enable them to do what they ought. Their Hi. and Mi. may be well a&s;&s;ured that his Maje&s;ty will never reject their Councel and Advice in any thing what&s;oever that may be rea&s;onably thought to conduce to the publick Peace, in which if he could have any a&s;&s;u|rance that he might find his &s;ecurity, he would immediately put an end to the War, and lay down his Arms as mildly, as he took them up generou&s;ly, for the intere&s;t and at the reque&s;t of his Allies.</P>

But in the mean time he thinks him&s;elf obliged to &s;ay beforehand, that his Electoral Highne&s;s having always repo&s;ed great confidence in the Sincerity, Integrity, and Ju&s;tice of their Highne&s;&s;es, the States General of
<PB N="21" REF="17"> the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> as tho&s;e that have been his an|cient Friends and Confederates, and who&s;e intere&s;ts are in many re&s;pects the &s;ame with his own, a&s;&s;ur|eth him&s;elf that their Highne&s;&s;es will not make any promi&s;e to his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, that &s;hall at all interfere with their Alliances, or be prejudicial to his Electoral Highne&s;s, who hath not &s;pared his own E&s;tates, nor his Blood, to &s;ave their Countrey from utter ruine and de&s;truction, with which it was threatned when three whole Provinces were torn from it though &s;ince by God's great mercy they have been reunited. Be&s;ides, his Ele|ctoral Highne&s;s promi&s;eth him&s;elf that their Hi. and Mi. will be &s;o rea&s;onable, &s;ince even his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty hath been willing to allow them the whole month of <HI>June</HI> to acquaint the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> with what they &s;hall think fit to re&s;olve upon his &s;aid Declaration, as not to anticipate the Term to the prejudice of his Electoral Highne&s;s, but will allow him a con|venient time for mature deliberation, and the di&s;|patching of &s;uch Order as &s;hall be nece&s;&s;ary to his Mini&s;ters here and el&s;ewhere. His Electoral High|ne&s;s takes it likewi&s;e for granted, that their Hi. and Mi. will never come to a Treaty, much le&s;s conclude any thing what&s;oever with <HI>France,</HI> without fir&s;t procuring for his Electoral Highne&s;s the &s;atisfaction promi&s;ed him in the 14 and 24 Ar|ticle of their Alliance, and without re&s;erving the &s;ame Liberty to them&s;elves with relation to their Allies, which his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty might or &s;hould re&s;erve in favour of his; E&s;pecially &s;ince it is evident, that his Electoral Highne&s;s did not engage in this War out of an <HI>airine&s;s of mind,</HI> but for the &s;afety of the Low Countreys, the
<PB N="22" REF="18"> pre&s;ervation of his own E&s;tates, and to &s;ecure him&s;elf again&s;t the injuries and attempts of others, and that he hath not been more de&s;irous of any thing &s;ince the fir&s;t beginning of this War, than of a firm and &s;ure Peace upon rea&s;onable Terms. And that he will always take in good part the good offices that &s;hall be u&s;ed to attain it, and that he will make appear as well his moderation with relation to the Terms and Conditions of it, as his due con&s;ideration of the rea&s;ons and ne|ce&s;&s;ities alledged by their High and Mighty for a Peace. Provided things may be &s;o ordered, that he may obtain his ends, which are no other than the &s;afety of the publick, and that of his own Countrey. This is what the &s;aid Amba&s;&s;ador hath thought fit to repre&s;ent by this writing to their Excellencies, the Amba&s;&s;adors and Plenipotentiaries of their High and Mighty that are here pre&s;ent, de&s;iring them not onely to recommend the Contents thereof to their Lords and Ma&s;ters, to the end they may make their joynt Reflections, when they &s;hall come to deliberate upon a matter of &s;o great im|portance, but al&s;o to &s;upport it as much in them lies by their own credit and wi&s;e conduct. <HI>Given at</HI> Nimeguen <HI>the</HI> 10th <HI>day of</HI> June, 1678.</P>

<HEAD>A Declaration on behalf of the Emperor.</HEAD>
<P>THe Amba&s;&s;adors of his Imperial Maje&s;ty being adverti&s;ed, that the States General of the <HI>United Provinces</HI> will &s;hortly meet, to con&s;ult upon the Declaration which his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty delivered in writing to their Amba&s;&s;ador
<PB N="23" REF="18"> Extraordinary Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Beverning,</HI> in the Camp at the Bourg of <HI>Wetteren</HI> on the fir&s;t day of this pre&s;ent month, do promi&s;e them&s;elves a&s;&s;ured|ly from the eminent Wi&s;dom, Integrity, and Ju&s;tice of the &s;aid States General, upon which founda|tions their Common-wealth has hitherto &s;tood and continued in a flouri&s;hing condition, that they will not upon any pretence what&s;oever act contrary to the Faith of their Alliances, or prejudicial to his Imperial Maje&s;ty, the Empire, and the re&s;t of the Confederates, who have allready engaged them|&s;elves as well in the dangers, and expences of this long and Bloody War, not onely for their own common &s;afety, to the end they might thereby deliver the&s;e <HI>United Provinces,</HI> together with the Publick, from utter ruine and de&s;truction. It is needle&s;s to put them in mind of what hath for|merly pa&s;&s;ed; this is evident, that the Confede|rates have to do with an Enemy, who as he is hard enough for them all, cannot but be terrible to any one of them apart. Perhaps &s;ome Pro|vinces may reap a pre&s;ent advantage, but in lieu thereof, all tho&s;e that are near mu&s;t inevitably fall under his yoke, and be de&s;troyed. There are &s;o many in&s;tances in Hi&s;tories how dangerous the neighbourhood of <HI>France</HI> is, that it hath given occa&s;ion to a Proverb. This the States them&s;elves have found by experience in this very War, when the Bar of the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands</HI> was &s;tronger. What will they do now that tho&s;e Bars are almo&s;t broken down, and they &s;hall have &s;eparated them|&s;elves, as the <HI>French</HI> earne&s;tly pre&s;s them to do, from the re&s;t of the Confederates? Then their &s;afety mu&s;t &s;olely depend upon the &s;incerity and moderation of the <HI>French.</HI> His Imperial Maje&s;ty
<PB N="24" REF="19"> undertook the War together with the re&s;t of the Confederates for their common &s;afety, for the de|fence of the Empire, and particularly that of the&s;e Provinces: he hath carried it on hitherto, not for his own private intere&s;t, but in &s;uch place and manner as was thought be&s;t good for the publick: And he is yet willing, if the Confederates plea&s;e, to continue it in conjunction with them, and will be ready to lay down his Arms, when that &s;hall make more for the Common intere&s;t. And when|ever he &s;hall make a Peace, he will have the &s;ame regard to the circum&s;tances of the <HI>United Provin|ces</HI> and of all the <HI>Low Conntreys,</HI> which he has appeared hitherto to have had in the undortaking and carrying on the War.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>France</HI> has propo&s;ed &s;ome condi|tions of Peace, but in &s;uch a manner as if he were giving Laws to us. He will not &s;uffer us to Treat with him <HI>concerning them.</HI> Which to be &s;o re|ceived by the Emperor, the Empire and the Con|federates, is not only incon&s;i&s;tent with their Ho|nour, Safety and Intere&s;t, contrary to the very na|ture of the thing it &s;elf. Be&s;ides which no &s;peci|fication at all is made in the&s;e conditions, what &s;a|tisfaction it is in particular, the <HI>French</HI> would have &s;tipulated in behalf of <HI>Sweden,</HI> &s;o it is but too evident they are far from any intentions of Peace, &s;ince they will not &s;o much as treat concerning it, according to tho&s;e Forms and Methods which are ob&s;erved betwixt Soveraign Princes and E&s;tates, and are grounded upon the Law of Nations. It is not a Peace that <HI>France</HI> aims at, but a divi&s;ion among&s;t the Confederates: that conque&s;t may be the more ea&s;ie, when he &s;hall have to do with them apart: if there be any urgent rea&s;on or
<PB N="25" REF="19"> nece&s;&s;ity of making a Peace, the Emperor is willing to do it forthwith upon &s;uch terms as will be neither dishonourable nor prejuaical to <HI>France,</HI> and manife&s;t to the whole World his moderation, according to his High Function; and that although he has great regard to the &s;afety of the Empire, yet that he prefers the common &s;afety and the pre&s;ervation of the <HI>United Provinces</HI> and of all the <HI>Low Countreys</HI> before any particular intere&s;ts of his own. This will be made apparent when|ever a Peace &s;hall be treated of, and the States General &s;hall employ their offices for it, which will be always acceptable to his Imperial Maje&s;ty, which being &s;o, it cannot without injury to the con&s;tancy, prudence, and integrity of the States General be prefumed that they will upon any ra&s;h re&s;olution abandon their mo&s;t faithful Confederate, and there|by expo&s;e them to manife&s;t danger. They have Twenty days time yet before the end of this month to re&s;olve in. But all our intere&s;ts, our common liberty, and the &s;afety of all the Confederates is now at &s;take. The enemy endeavours to preci|pitate their re&s;olutions, becau&s;e he is their ene|my, and would lead them to a precipice: the Con|federates Council is to proceed &s;afely and deliberate|ly, as being engaged in one and the &s;ame common cau&s;e with the States General, when once the Enemy &s;hall ob&s;erve that the States re&s;olve to Treat &s;e|parately, <HI>France</HI> will obtain what is de&s;ired, the general Peace will be de&s;perate, which otherwi&s;e might have been expected, if all the Confederates would have made appear to the common Enemy their unanimous con&s;tancy and moderation. Let the States General therefore repre&s;ent &s;peedily and &s;eriou&s;ly to the Amba&s;&s;adors of his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian
<PB N="26" REF="20"> Maje&s;ty, that it is that they hinder the re&s;toring of Peace to Chri&s;tendom, in that they deny the Con|federates liberty to Treat about tho&s;e matters with|out which there can be no Peace: the Amba&s;&s;adors of his Imperial Maje&s;ty do hereby oblige them|&s;elves to repre&s;ent the whole matter that the mo|tives and nece&s;&s;iries which induced the States Ge|neral to chu&s;e even a di&s;advantageous Peace, ra|ther than the continuance of the War, are not at all di&s;plea&s;ing to his Imperial Maje&s;ty, who will be ready to comply therewith, and to concur with them as far as in him lies, to endeavour a Peace, &s;o as the &s;afety of the Empire be in &s;ome degree provided for; and that he will jointly con&s;ult with the States General and the other Confederates, by what way and means the &s;ame may be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed and rendred &s;ecure.</P>

<PB N="32" REF="23"> Evacuation of tho&s;e places, after the Peace Signed, concluded and ratified betwixt his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty and <HI>Spain</HI> and this State: and that the States could not fore&s;ee that there would ari&s;e any new ob&s;tructions or difficulties on his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ti's part, after he had given them him|&s;elf and by his Mini&s;ters &s;o many a&s;&s;urances of his unfeigned inclinations not only to a general Peace, but particularly to a Peace with this State.</P>
<P>It is very true, that when his Meje&s;ty compos'd a general platform for us to take our mea&s;ures by, it was put down in the fir&s;t Article, that his Maje&s;ty would never li&s;ten to any Terms of Peace, other than &s;uch as &s;hould give the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> full and compleat &s;atisfaction: and his Maje&s;ty might with good rea&s;on in&s;r&s;t upon it, and take care to have it effected, if we had been able to di&s;po&s;e the Confederates to accept the conditions of that Project. But &s;ince the Confederates did not think it their intere&s;ts to make Peace upon tho&s;e terms, as the States fore&s;aw at fir&s;t they would not, and that his Catholick Maje&s;ty would make &s;ome &s;cruple, as the Amba&s;&s;adors of the State intimated to tho&s;e of <HI>France,</HI> de&s;iring them to let them know what places the King their Ma&s;ter intended &s;hould make the Bar in the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands:</HI> and his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ure the States by a Letter of the <HI>18th</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> written from his Camp, in ca&s;e his Catholick Maje&s;ty &s;hould refu&s;e the Peace upon the &s;aid Terms, and that the States would conclude their Treaty, and oblige them&s;elves to remain neuters, that then his Maje&s;ty would always be willing to grant to <HI>Spain</HI> the conditions of the Project, and promi&s;ed not to lay Siege to any place in the <HI>Spani&s;h Nether|lands</HI>

<P><HI>His Maje&s;ty had likewi&s;e rea&s;on to hope, that by advantaging both them and</HI> Spain, <HI>in being willing to quit &s;o many important Places for the &s;ake of</HI> Sweden, <HI>they would have joyned with him to procure the re|e&s;tabli&s;hment of that Crown; and though his Maje&s;ty hath not de&s;ired them to unite their Forces to his, to put that Crown in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Places it hath lo&s;t; yet they ought not to hinder him from making u&s;e of tho&s;e Means that are in his power, for the effectual executing of a Condition, to which they have &s;o &s;olemnly con&s;ented.

<P>His Maje&s;ty Declaring farther, that though the u&s;|ual Cu&s;tom in &s;uch Ca&s;es requires, that things &s;hould continue in the &s;ame condition they are in, till the Peace be ab&s;olutely Con&s;ummated by an exchange of Ratifications, and a publication of the Treaties;
<PB N="47" REF="30"> that yet upon their account, he had &s;ent his im|mediate Orders to the Duke of <HI>Luxemburg,</HI> to withdraw his Army from the adjacent parts of <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> and March them into his own Countreys; and that he Charged the &s;aid Duke, for this pur|po&s;e, to agree with the Duke <HI>de Villa Hermo&s;a,</HI> as al&s;o their Envoys with him, about the Conduct that &s;hould be among the Officers that were to Com|mand the Troops, which his Maje&s;ty was obliged to leave in the places about the Town of <HI>Mons;</HI> as al&s;o how they &s;hould live of one &s;ide as well as the other, without Ho&s;tility in a good under&s;tand|ing, and with Liberty in the <HI>Low Countreys,</HI> till the Exchange of the Rati&s;ications with <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>From all this, it evidently follows, that the Intentions, as well of his Maje&s;ty as the Lords the States General, have been from the beginning, to make a General Peace, upon &s;uch Conditions as all the Allies might have agreed unto; and being very uncertain, whether the &s;aid Allies would re|gulate them&s;elves by the Conditions his Maje&s;ty had propo&s;ed, and having Explained him&s;elf, that he would admit of no Alteration, their Lord&s;hips have de&s;ired an Explanation of his Maje&s;ties Intentions toward them, and of the Conditions that concerned them, and have had the good fortune to receive In|&s;tructions, not only from the mouth of his Am|ba&s;&s;adors, but al&s;o by two Letters from his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf; that in re&s;pect to them, they &s;hould en|joy the &s;aid Conditions, and particularly tho&s;e re|lating to the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands,</HI> though his Ca|tholick Maje&s;ty, or any other of his Allies &s;hould ob&s;truct the Peace, upon condition, that when they Conclude the Treaty, they &s;hould not directly. not indirectly A&s;&s;i&s;t their Allies, again&s;t his Maje&s;ty or
<PB N="48" REF="31"> his Allies whil&s;t the War &s;hould continue; by which it is manife&s;tly apparent, that it has been no ways his Maje&s;ties intention to retard, or protract the Peace or the effects thereof by any means what&s;oever: as to tho&s;e that &s;hould, who would be ready, and in a condition to make a Conclu&s;ion, though &s;ome other per&s;ons &s;hould not as yet prove &s;o; and to contract only, that tho&s;e who &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe the Peace, &s;hould not a&s;&s;i&s;t directly nor indirectly tho&s;e that would continue the War again&s;t his Maje&s;ty or his Allies. And thus it is altogether incredible that &s;o Generous a &s;oul as his Maje&s;ties, after &s;uch clear and Indi&s;putable Declarations, as are contained in his Letters could entertain &s;uch a Sentiment; and certainly their Lord&s;hips the States General would be extremely &s;urpri&s;ed, if his Maje&s;ties Intentions &s;hould be found Conformable to the Expre&s;&s;ions of the &s;aid <HI>Memorial</HI> it being a very Erroneous Po&s;ition, that their Lord&s;hips the States General did ever De|clare, that they found all the Conditions equitable which his Maje&s;ty had propo&s;ed, having never ex|plained them&s;elves, but in tho&s;e things which re|lated to their own particular intere&s;ts, and having al&s;o demanded time to Di&s;po&s;e their Allies to what may farther be required.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides that, it is mo&s;t certain, a Declaration of that Nature was never required of them; that even his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf having weighed the Scruple, which they were to be &s;atisfied in, that all their Allies could not po&s;&s;ibly be Inclined to accept of the Conditions propo&s;ed, did anticipate them, by his Declaration, that not with&s;tanding all this, upon their own, as well as the King of <HI>Spains</HI> account, he would ever conde&s;cend to them, provided they would put a period to their Treaty upon the con|ditions

<P>And it is &s;omewhat &s;urprizing, that the fore&s;aid Amba&s;&s;adors &s;hould po&s;itively affirm in the &s;aid Memorial, that his Maje&s;ty did never Conde&s;cend to the Re&s;titution of Places to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI>

<P>The Lords the States General de&s;ire &s;ervently and Cordially, that the War in the Northern parts &s;hould be ended by convenient means: but his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty and the King of <HI>Swedes,</HI> not be|ing able to Agree upon Conditions with the Allies of their Lord&s;hips they will look upon the Continuation of the War with great Di&s;&s;atis&s;action; but yet in the interim they are apt to believe, that the <HI>French</HI> Am|ba&s;&s;adors are mi&s;taken, when they would Infer from

<P>It is very certain, that the Countrey of his Electoral Highne&s;s of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> may be in|fe&s;ted, and al&s;o tho&s;e belonging to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> more commodiou&s;ly by tho&s;e Countreys which the States General at pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;s; but as his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty did never pretend, and his Amba&s;&s;adors would do ill to pretend, that his Maje&s;ty might lawfully make u&s;e of their Terri|tories and Places to that purpo&s;e; nor can they pretend any more, that his Maje&s;ty can make u&s;e of tho&s;e Places, which he hath engaged to re|&s;tore, having re&s;erv'd no &s;uch kind of Right to him&s;elf, nor any thing what&s;oever in order to &s;uch a de&s;ign; but onely the &s;aid Neutrality of the Parties contracting with him; it being ob&s;erv|able, that nothing in the world can be more oppo|&s;ite to the Neutrality, than to grant one Party the power to employ tho&s;e Territories and Places to infe&s;t and indemni&s;ie the other Parties, nor more prejudicial to the Intere&s;ts of their Lord&s;hips, than thereby to bring upon them&s;elves the mi&s;chiefs and inconveniences of a War in their Neighbourhood, and even to their very Frontiers; &s;o that in lieu of enjoying the &s;weetne&s;s and effects of a Peace, and being a&s;certain'd of a Boundary for their &s;ecurity and repo&s;e, they &s;hall find them&s;elves de&s;titute

<P>What the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors &s;ay farther in that Memorial, merits 2 very particular reflecti|on, that their Sentiments in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e are conformable to the practi&s;e in all other Treaties; it being very notorious, that when there is a Gene|ral Treaty made, all the Contractors ought to have &s;atisfaction, which cannot be applied to the ca&s;e in hand. His mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty having thought good to enter into a particular Negotiation with the King of <HI>Spain</HI> and the States General, without &s;haring with the other Allies, which would not con|cur therein. Tis true, that if the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> or the States General, &s;hould not perform the Condi|tions of &s;uch a General Treaty, but fail therein, his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty might ju&s;tly demand the effect of the Conditions agreed unto: but the&s;e two Powers being altogether di&s;po&s;ed to &s;atisfie in all, and by all, which they are engaged to, on their behalf, his Maje&s;ty cannot have the lea&s;t pre|tence, that they &s;hould be fru&s;trated of the accom|pli&s;hment of what &s;hould be promi&s;ed them by particular Treaties, and upon con&s;ideration where|of, they &s;hould &s;et their hands. Over and above, that his Maje&s;ty, having put into the fir&s;t Article of his Propo&s;itions, the entire &s;atisfaction the <HI>Swede</HI> &s;hould have, which is now made the ground of all the pre&s;ent difficulties, explains him&s;elf in the &s;ame Period by the&s;e words, [That without them, he could not conclude upon all the re&s;t.] Whence it ought to be inferred, without all manner of di&s;pute, that he would not de&s;i&s;t in ca&s;e of a General Treaty; but that it was not intended to apply it to
<PB N="54" REF="34"> the ca&s;e of particular Conventions, which is now in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The Allegations which are made to this Propo|&s;al of the <HI>Pyrenaean</HI> Treaty, and the example of <HI>Verceil,</HI> the re&s;titution whereof the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath promi&s;ed, are not at all applicable here; for that Places was in his own hands, and he might di&s;po&s;e of it as he thought good: but in our ca&s;e, they have not onely not demanded any re&s;titution, either from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> or the States General, as indeed it could not ju&s;tly be required of them, be|cau&s;e they were not all po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any thing that appertained to the <HI>Swede;</HI> his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Ma|je&s;ty propo&s;ing no other matter to them, but the Neutrality onely: and there might, on the con|trary, be drawn a &s;olid Argument from the &s;ame Treaty of the <HI>Pyrenaeans,</HI> to ju&s;tifie what is at pre|&s;ent pretended to, concerning the Evacuation, al|ledging, that his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty hath con|&s;ented to the re&s;titution of the Places to <HI>Spain,</HI> not|with&s;tanding the continuation of the War between that Crown and <HI>Portugal.</HI></P>
<P>Tis true, that in the project of Treaties, there is no mention at all made of the Time when the Places &s;hould be re&s;tored; but it is certain and no|torious, that the Con&s;equence of a Treaty is the immediate Exchange of Ratifications, after which, full &s;atisfaction ought to be given to all that is promi&s;ed and agreed unto, without any limitation of time; and to that end there can be nothing ap|plied more Authentick, than what his Maje&s;ty. was plea&s;ed to alledge in his la&s;t Letter of the <HI>30th.</HI> of <HI>June</HI> pa&s;s'd, where he &s;ays, That it is the u&s;ual cu|&s;tom in all Treaties, for all things to continue in the
<PB N="55" REF="34"> &s;tate they are in, till the Peace be ab&s;olutely con|&s;ummated by Exchange of Ratifications, and the Publication of them; and that con&s;equently it were directly contrary to that u&s;age, for his Maje&s;ty to pretend to detain the places, after the Ratifications duly Exchanged, and the Publication made. Their Lord&s;hips may di&s;pen&s;e with the Di&s;cour&s;e of the Conduct of his Maje&s;ties Army in the <HI>Spani&s;h Ne|therlands,</HI> after the return of Mon&s;ieur <HI>de Lanoy,</HI> who brought back his Maje&s;ty's An&s;wer of the <HI>30th.</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> made to theirs of the <HI>22d.</HI> of the &s;ame month; but in the mean time they afflict them&s;elves, not without rea&s;on, becau&s;e that by all the&s;e diffi|culties, &s;o ill grounded, the Conclu&s;ion and Signa|ture of the Treaties hath been retarded, and even refu&s;ed; when as their Amba&s;&s;adors did duly pre|&s;ent them&s;elves to tho&s;e of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Ma|je&s;ty, according to their promi&s;e, becau&s;e that their Lord&s;hips could by no means endure, that the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> no more than they them&s;elves to their extreme prejudice, &s;hould be di&s;appointed in the principal effect of Peace; namely, of the Eva|cuation of the &s;aid Places, and con&s;equently of the Boundary, which his Maje&s;ty had &s;o frequently and &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ured them.</P>
<P>Their High and Mighty Lord&s;hips &s;incerely de|clare, that they de&s;ire nothing more cordially, than to &s;ee the Peace e&s;tabli&s;hed between his Maje&s;ty, the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and their own State joyntly to|gether, with all the Confederates that will &s;ub&s;cribe it; and that they are willing, and ready al&s;o to cau&s;e the Treaties to be Concluded and Signed: But we cannot ju&s;tly de&s;ire of them, that the &s;aid Evacuati|on &s;hould depend upon the &s;ucce&s;s of Affairs, and a Re&s;titution and Satisfaction, which according to all
<PB N="56" REF="35"> humane apprehen&s;ion, will not be regulated, but by the &s;ucce&s;s of the War, the Accidents and Chances whereof are always expo&s;ed to incertainty.</P>
<P>Tis further to be taken into con&s;ideration, that the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> has not to this hour given any order for the &s;atisfaction of their High and Mighty Lord&s;hips, in regard of the ju&s;t complaints, and ex|ce&s;&s;ive damages of their Subjects; nay, not &s;o much as to renew and re-e&s;tabli&s;h their ancient Amity with them; but contrarily, daily add new prejudices to their Negotiation, by Acts of Ho&s;tility, directly con|trary to the Treaties provi&s;ionally e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>And as his Maje&s;ty ought rationally to expect, from the Lords the States General, that they &s;hould ever look upon his Royal Word as firm and invio|lable, they cannot be per&s;uaded, that he would by any means what&s;oever alter the Conditions which he hath propo&s;ed by &s;o remarkable a Change; and are &s;o much the more a&s;&s;ured thereof, in that their Amba&s;&s;adors at <HI>London,</HI> having repre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain</HI> the &s;cruple of this new up&s;tart Difficulty, his Maje&s;ty did an&s;wer them with a&s;&s;urance, that there &s;hould be no &s;top upon it; and thereby they have been &s;trongly per&s;uaded, that this delay was to be imputed, not to his Ma|je&s;ties Sentiments, but to the per&s;ua&s;ion of tho&s;e who de&s;ire not a Peace: but that however they hope his Maje&s;ty, according to the greatne&s;s of his Gene|ro&s;ity, will take off that Delay.</P>
<P>As to the Propo&s;ition the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors made in their Memorial, the Lords the States Ge|neral do con&s;ider it two very different ways; either as an Expedient to accommodate the Affairs of the Northern Powers, by amicable means; or el&s;e to employ their Forces to oblige their Allies to return
<PB N="57" REF="35"> the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> their Conque&s;ts, obtain'd du|ring this War. As to the fir&s;t, they doubt not that the <HI>French</HI> Amba&s;&s;adors are &s;ufficiently per&s;uaded, with what &s;ervor they de&s;ired to &s;ee the accom|pli&s;hment of a General Peace; and they &s;hall never be better &s;atisfied in any thing, than in &s;eeing it concluded, and that they will always continue to interpo&s;e, and u&s;e their utmo&s;t endeavours to ob|tain a Benefit &s;o much de&s;ired; intreating his Ma|je&s;ty, that he will plea&s;e to furni&s;h them with means in order thereunto, their Amba&s;&s;adors being fully informed of their good intentions, without being obliged to the Evacuation of Places: But if it be his Maje&s;ties inclination to engage them, in pur&s;uance of that propo&s;ition to violence, and con|&s;traint, they find them&s;elves obliged to &s;ay, That they under&s;tand no manner of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters">ity therein, and that it is diametrically oppo&s;ite to, what his Ma|je&s;ty did him&s;elf judge rea&s;onable, and that they can by no means &s;ub&s;cribe it, not being able at all to prevail with them&s;elves but by force; they mu&s;t engage their Allies, with whom they have been concern'd in the &s;ame Obligations, to re&s;tore what they have taken from the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> King, and &s;o con&s;equently mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;itated to take up Arms again&s;t their Friends and Confederates; a thing altogether unheard of, and which cannot ju&s;tly be required of them; his Maje&s;ty having &s;e|veral times declar'd, that as for him&s;elf and his Allies, and in confideration of their Mighty Lord|&s;hips and theirs, he onely demanded the Neutrality before-mention'd.</P>
<P>And thus the Lords the States General do a&s;|&s;ure them&s;elves, that the French Amba&s;&s;adors, as well as all tho&s;e that are not prepo&s;&s;e&s;s'd, will be

<P>THe Amba&s;&s;ador and Envoy Extraordinary of their Lord&s;hips the States General of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> having &s;ent to their Hi. and Mi. the Memorial of the Lords Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>France,</HI> of the <HI>29th.</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> have received expre&s;s order from their Ma&s;ters to an&s;wer their Excellencies, that they were tran&s;ported to under&s;tand thereby the continuance of his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty's real intentions for Peace; and that them&s;elves will not be wanting on their part to do whatever may fur|ther the concluding it, and that they are ex|tremely &s;orry to &s;ee it &s;tick &s;olely upon giving the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> &s;atisfaction, and that that &s;hould be of &s;uch con&s;ideration to his Maje&s;ty, as to be capable of giving a &s;top to the fini&s;hing a work that is &s;o much de&s;ired.</P>
<P>The States General think, that they have done all that could po&s;&s;ibly be expected from a State, that is a Lover of Peace; having declared their ac|ceptance
<PB N="66" REF="41"> of the Conditions which the King him&s;elf had propo&s;ed, as far as they concern them&s;elves; and having laboured to the utmo&s;t of their power to bring their Allies to a compliance; in which endeavours they have been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful with the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> that he likewi&s;e accepts the Condi|tions that concern him&s;elf. And yet after all this, to their great &s;orrow, they find them&s;elves deprived of the benefit of tho&s;e Conditions, not upon the account of any thing that might or ought to have been done by them, but becau&s;e the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> mu&s;t fir&s;t be &s;atisfi'd, though neither his Catholick Maje&s;ty nor them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any thing that mu&s;t make part of his &s;atisfaction; and though the &s;aid King continue daily to exerci&s;e all manner of Ho|&s;tilities again&s;t their Inhabitants, directly contrary to Treaties &s;olemnly ratifi'd.</P>
<P>Yet their Hi. and Mi. notwith&s;tanding their Inha|bitants meet with &s;uch bad u&s;age from the &s;aid King, and though they have evidently had ju&s;t cau&s;e to fall upon him, and make War upon him, as he does upon them, have cho&s;en rather to endea|vour a Peace in the North, and have offered to do all good offices in order to it; if his mo&s;t Chri|&s;tian Maje&s;ty will be plea&s;ed to furni&s;h them with &s;ome Expedients; and they do yet per&s;i&s;t in the &s;ame mind, and &s;hould be ready to propo&s;e Ex|pedients them&s;elves, if they knew of any: But they cannot in any wi&s;e expect from his Maje&s;ties generous di&s;po&s;ition, that after having te&s;tifi'd &s;o much good will to them, he &s;hould oblige them to act forcibly again&s;t their Allies; and that, not to procure his Maje&s;ty better &s;atisfaction, but meerly for the benefit of his Ally.</P>
<P>Their Hi. and Mi. will ever profe&s;s a great reve|rence
<PB N="67" REF="41"> for his Maje&s;ty, and will bear him as much de|ference as he can po&s;&s;ibly de&s;ire; but they do not &s;ee of what u&s;e it will be to put his Maje&s;ty to trou|ble, by &s;ending their Deputies to St. <HI>Quintin,</HI> not having any them&s;elves to propo&s;e to him; for the Places mu&s;t be Evacuated when the Treaty is con|cluded, in di&s;charge of that &s;olemn promi&s;e which his Maje&s;ty made to them; and as to that, there remains no difficulty. And concerning the King of <HI>Sweden,</HI> as his Maje&s;ties Ally, they offer to do all friendly offices for his Accommodation; and cer|tainly &s;uch endeavours cannot be made with greater likelihood of &s;ucce&s;s any where el&s;e, than at <HI>Ni|meguen,</HI> where all the Mini&s;ters of the Confederates are: There we may labour to di&s;po&s;e them, with hopes of &s;ucce&s;s; there we may be informed of what-ever may be nece&s;&s;ary to promote the com|mon good, and may u&s;e all manner of endeavours, which cannot be &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, either at St. <HI>Quintin</HI> or at <HI>Ghent.</HI></P>
<P>The States General conceive the le&s;s hopes from &s;uch a Deputation, becau&s;e the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>France</HI> did not in&s;tance, as to what Expedients in particular their Deputies &s;hould come in&s;tructed: and they think his Maje&s;ty may propo&s;e what he would have, and do what-ever is to be done &s;ooner, and more readily at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> than either at St: <HI>Quintin</HI> or any other Place. They de&s;ire with all their hearts, that his Maje&s;ty would propo&s;e &s;ome Expedients to further the Peace; and them|&s;elves will at the &s;ame time make appear, how af|fectionately they de&s;ire to help forward, as much as in them lies, the perfecting this great work: and they earne&s;tly de&s;ire, that the time may be well husbanded, for that as yet they find them|&s;elves

<P><HI>It is evident, that his Maje&s;ty doth not incline to any Party, but out of his de&s;ire to fini&s;h the affair of the Peace as &s;oon as may be; and out of the confidence that he repo&s;eth in the word of the States General, he hath always de&s;ired, that they would &s;end their Deputies, either to him&s;elf, or to</HI> Ghent, <HI>both to concert what will be nece&s;&s;ary for the warranting to his Maje&s;ty the Engagement that</HI> Spain <HI>is to enter into, of not a&s;&s;i&s;ting his Enemies, nor tho&s;e of his Allies, and to agree upon &s;uch means as his Maje&s;ty &s;hould propo&s;e to them, for the more ea&s;ie re&s;toring of</HI> Sweden, <HI>without obliging them to enter into a War in order to it:</HI>

<PB N="72" REF="44"> General received the Counter-Project, yet now in &s;even weeks time they have not return'd their an&s;wer to it, and remitted the affair hither to be adju&s;ted and fini&s;hed, by the Amba&s;&s;adors and Pleni|potentiaries of both parties: in order whereunto the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Sweden</HI> have not failed all this time to make frequent in&s;tances, both here at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> where they have been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>France,</HI> and at the <HI>Hague</HI> by the Sieur <HI>Silvercroon.</HI> Be&s;ides this point of Commerce, as there have been &s;ome complaints made that cer|tain Ve&s;&s;els laden with Corn, and belonging to the Subjects of this State, have been taken and carried to <HI>Strael&s;ond,</HI> and that Count <HI>Conning&s;mark</HI> had taken out their lading to &s;erve for food for his Army, the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Sweden</HI> having been informed of the &s;aid complaints by the Amba&s;&s;a|dors of the States General, gave in a Declaration the <HI>18th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> that the &s;aid action of the Mare|&s;hal of <HI>Connig&s;mark</HI> could not be reputed any other than a meer act of nece&s;&s;ity, which he then was reduced to, through want of Victuals and Cor|re&s;pondence; that the parties concern'd &s;hould be &s;atisfied to the full, and that he would pa&s;s any &s;uch Act to that end as &s;hould be thought fit, knowing that &s;uch was the King his Ma&s;ters inten|tion. The &s;ame has likewi&s;e bin a&s;&s;ured by the Com|mi&s;&s;ary <HI>Silvercroon</HI> at the <HI>Hague,</HI> and an extract has &s;ince been delivered of a Letter from the Mare|&s;hal <HI>de Coning&s;mark,</HI> containing the like a&s;&s;urances, together with a relation how he had acted, and that he had paid the Ma&s;ters of the Ships their Freight. Which things being &s;o, the Amba&s;&s;a|dors of <HI>Sweden</HI> believed that the States General would have received all the &s;atisfaction they
<PB N="73" REF="44"> could po&s;&s;ibly de&s;ire, and that nothing was want|ing to conclude a Peace betwixt the King their Ma&s;ter, and them, but to prepare &s;uch Articles as are u&s;ual almo&s;t in all Treaties of Peace, which would be no hard work for the Amba&s;&s;adors of both parties to do. But in &s;tead of that, they are &s;urpri&s;ed to under&s;tand, that there have been very bitter complaints again&s;t <HI>Sweden,</HI> in the an&s;wers that the Amba&s;&s;adors of the States General gave on the <HI>26th.</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> and the <HI>7th.</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> to the Memorials of the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>France,</HI> and though the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Sweden</HI> have here|tofore explained and declared them&s;elves, as is before mentioned, yet they would not omit giving &s;ome proper an&s;wer to them, but that having agreed with the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>France,</HI> that for the avoiding all &s;harpne&s;s, neither of them will meddle in things of that nature, they are willing to pa&s;s them all over with &s;ilence, and to endeavour &s;omething of reality; to which end they repeat their in&s;tances here at <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> as Mon&s;ieur <HI>Boreel</HI> cannot but know, as well as at the <HI>Hague</HI> by the Sieur <HI>Silvercroon,</HI> that the States General would advance the Negotiation with <HI>Sweden,</HI> that the Peace may be concluded at the &s;ame time that it &s;hall be with <HI>France,</HI> &s;ince one cannot be with|out the other.</P>
<P>And the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Sweden</HI> apprehended, that the reiterating their in&s;tances had produced a good effect, &s;ince the Sieur <HI>Silvercroon</HI> &s;ent word from the <HI>Hague,</HI> by the la&s;t Courrier, That he had been conferr'd with, and that the An&s;wer to the Counter-project was ready to be &s;ent to <HI>Nime|guen.</HI></P>
<P>But whil&s;t they were in this expectation, the
<PB N="74" REF="45"> Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>France</HI> inform them, That but ye&s;terday the Amba&s;&s;adors of the States General renew'd their complaints again&s;t <HI>Sweden,</HI> for rai|&s;ing difficulties, and that Count <HI>Coning&s;mark</HI> exer|ci&s;ed acts of Ho&s;tility, Confi&s;cating Ships and Car|go's belonging to the Subjects of this State; in&s;o|much that the States had more rea&s;on to continue the War, than to think of a Peace with <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>By which the &s;aid Amba&s;&s;adors perceiving with &s;orrow, that but little reflection is made upon what they have heretofore advanced, and being al&s;o very certain, that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Coning&s;mark</HI> hath not confi&s;cated any thing belonging to the Subjects of this State, nor done any acts of Ho&s;tility again&s;t them, &s;ince they agree to make amends for all; and &s;eeing how lightly the good Offices are thought on, which the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Sweden</HI> have done &s;ince they came to <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> to further a Peace for the benefit of this State; and even the endea|vours which they have but lately u&s;ed with his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, to facilitate the Evacuation of the Places; do entreat the Amba&s;&s;adors of his Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, to an&s;wer and repre&s;ent to the Amba&s;&s;adors of the States General, that they do ill to complain of <HI>Sweden,</HI> after it has offered &s;o many facilities, and made &s;o many advances; and con&s;equently to induce them, in&s;tead of exa&s;perating matters, rather to expre&s;s &s;uch readine&s;s and faci|lity on behalf of the States General, as may rea|&s;onably be expected from them, that &s;o both Par|ties may receive that &s;atisfaction which they wi&s;h for, in the conclu&s;ion of a good Peace. The &s;aid Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Sweden</HI> hope, that the States Gene|ral have no intentions of protracting the Negotia|tion of the Peace with <HI>Sweden,</HI> to the end that them|&s;elves
<PB N="75" REF="45"> may be able to make a Separate Peace with his mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maje&s;ty, excluding <HI>Sweden;</HI> but they think notwith&s;tanding, that to prevent all ob|&s;tacles, it were well, if all hopes of &s;uch a Separa|tion were taken away.

<P>THE Lords, the States General of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> having Affairs of great importance to impart to your Excellence, have Commi&s;&s;ionated us under-written their Deputies Extraordinary, and to this end their Hi. and Mi. have provided us of this Letter of Credit, to pre&s;ent to your Excel|lence.</P>
<P>The A&s;&s;i&s;tances which his Catholique Maje&s;ty gave to the State of the <HI>United Provinces</HI> in the beginning of this War, were &s;o u&s;eful and advanta|gious to this Commonwealth, that their Hi. and Mi. &s;hall ever be mindful of it: And to te&s;tifie, as &s;oon as was po&s;&s;ible, their re&s;entment thereof to his Ca|tholick Maje&s;ty, they failed not to come with all their Forces to his Maje&s;tie's &s;uccour, when his Pro|vinces were attack'd by the Arms of the King of <HI>France;</HI> and they a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves that your Ex|cellence is per&s;waded of it, &s;ince your Excellence &s;ees how much their Hi. and Mi. do to this day con|tribute to the pre&s;ervation of his Maje&s;tie's Country. And notwith&s;tanding this War has been continued many years, and at an infinite expence, yet the ef|fects have been &s;o unfortunate, that the King of <HI>France,</HI> being puff'd up with his Victories and Con|que&s;ts, will not come out of it, but upon the Con|ditions that have been delivered at <HI>Nimeguen</HI> to the Mediators, which your Excellence knows what they are.</P>
<PB N="139" REF="77">
<P>Which Conditions, con&s;idered in them&s;elves, are indeed too hard, and of &s;uch a nature as they ought to be rejected, which al&s;o their Hi. and Mi. would do in regard of their Allies, and chiefly in regard of his Catholick Maje&s;ty, as concerning the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> in the pre&s;ervation whereof they find them&s;elves &s;o deeply intere&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>But when their Hi. and Mi. reflect upon the Power of the King of <HI>France,</HI> which hitherto and during this War has been &s;uch, that he has not only made Head again&s;t the Armies of his Catholick Maje&s;ty, and tho&s;e of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> and their Allies, but has made great Conque&s;ts in divers Parts, they conceive a ju&s;t apprehen&s;ion, that the&s;e Conditions, how hard &s;oever, ought yet to be prefer'd, con&s;i|dering the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Affairs, to a continuance of the War, which in all probability would prove very fatal.</P>
<P>Which makes our Ma&s;ters the States General of the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> incline to look upon the&s;e Con|ditions, as receivable, if they &s;hould have the hap|pine&s;s to find their Allies, and e&s;pecially his Catho|lick Maje&s;ty in the &s;ame Sentiments.</P>
<P>And &s;hould very much wi&s;h, That your Excel|lence, on the behalf of his Catholick Maje&s;ty, would concur with them, to make them as agreea|ble, as may be, to the other Allies.</P>
<P>And in the mean time give Order to labour for a prolongation of the Term, which the King of <HI>France</HI> has given by his Propo&s;ition at <HI>Nimeguen.</HI></P>

<P>HIS Excellence having con&s;idered this Memo|rial, and that the lo&s;s of <HI>Flanders,</HI> by the hardne&s;s of the Conditions of <HI>France,</HI> will be greater and more di&s;honourable, than by the ill &s;ucce&s;s of Arms, mu&s;t hope that the States General will not further it, &s;ince his Maje&s;ty, wholly for its pre&s;er|vation, has expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the manife&s;t hazards of War, which he has &s;uffered &s;o much by.

<P>THE Lords, the States General of the <HI>United Provinces,</HI> having &s;een and peru&s;ed your Ex|cellencie's An&s;wer to the Memorial, that we, their under-written Deputies Extraordinary, pre&s;ented the 8th of this Moneth, could have wi&s;hed, That your Excellence had not only con&s;idered the Condi|tions offered by the King of <HI>France,</HI> as they are in them&s;elves, but had al&s;o made reflexion upon the
<PB N="142" REF="79"> pre&s;ent &s;tate of Affairs, and con&s;idered, that the King of <HI>France,</HI> being become Ma&s;ter of all the Frontier Towns of his Catholick Maje&s;tie's <HI>Nether|lands,</HI> was entred into the heart of them, and had made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter even of the Town of <HI>Gand,</HI> be|ing very &s;trong in the Field, and at the Head of a very formidable Army, ready for any enterprize, and in the greate&s;t appearance in the world of &s;uc|ceeding and conquering where he will: Whereas the Troops of the Allies, not being yet come toge|ther, much le&s;s in a condition to make Head again&s;t him, and oppo&s;e his de&s;igns. Hence it is, that their Hi. and Mi. apprehend with great rea&s;on, that what remains to the King of <HI>Spain</HI> in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> will infallibly be lo&s;t, if it be not &s;aved, by accept|ing the Conditions of Peace that are offered; and it would be a thing very &s;en&s;ible to their Hi. and Mi. if what his Catholick Maje&s;ty has yet left in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> &s;hould be &s;o lo&s;t, after &s;uch infi|nite expences, and &s;o much blood &s;pilt, for their pre&s;ervation. Your Excellence knows but too well, by what has lately happened, what Account one has to make of the Troops of the Confederates, upon occa&s;ion. The A&s;&s;i&s;tance which is expected from his Maje&s;ty of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> is very con&s;iderable, and will be of great &s;upport to our Party; but it de&s;erves your Excellencie's con&s;ideration, that tho&s;e Troops are but newly rai&s;ed, and that it will require &s;ome time to enure them to the War, that as yet there are but few of them in the&s;e Parts, and we are uncertain when the re&s;t will come; whereas on the other &s;ide, every moment is precious, and great misfortunes may happen in a &s;hort &s;pace. And moreover, the States, as they have made it to be declared to your Excellence, are not in a condition
<PB N="143" REF="79"> to carry on the War, in &s;uch manner, and with &s;o much vigor, as they have done hitherto, &s;eeing their Trea&s;ures are exhau&s;ted, and their People not able to contribute &s;o much any longer.</P>
<P>As the Lords, the States General, will always acknowledge to have received, in the beginning of this War, very important and u&s;eful Succours from his Catholick Maje&s;ty, &s;o they hope, your Excel|lence will do them the ju&s;tice to confe&s;s, that they have not been wanting in the &s;equel of it, to te&s;tifie their acknowledgment, by u&s;ing their endeavours, and being at extraordinary charges to a&s;&s;i&s;t this Country; and at lea&s;t that it is not to be imputed to them, that the King of <HI>France</HI> has made &s;o great a progre&s;s, and that he will not make Peace, but upon &s;uch di&s;advantagious Conditions, as whereby the Country will indeed be much weakned, and hardly able to maintain nece&s;&s;ary Troops for its de|fence; but on the other hand, the Places will not be &s;o di&s;-joyn'd, nor the Country &s;o divided, as it was before the War, which will make it ea&s;ier to be kept and pre&s;erved. The&s;e Defects may likewi&s;e be &s;upplyed by Alliances, and a little time may do much toward a redre&s;s of Affairs, and making the King's Subjects, and particularly tho&s;e of the <HI>Uni|ted Provinces,</HI> capable of a&s;&s;i&s;ting one another; who at pre&s;ent are in &s;o lamentable a condition, and &s;o utterly unable, that they cannot be obliged to a continuance of the extraordinary charges, without great hazard, and without expo&s;ing them to the ut|mo&s;t extremity, and finding our &s;elves reduced to a nece&s;&s;ity, either of accommodating with the Enemy, whether we will or no, or of lying down under the burden. To which they do not think your Excel|lence will be of opinion, That they &s;tand obliged by
<PB N="144" REF="80"> tho&s;e Treaties, that had no other end, than the good of the Allies, and the &s;afety of their People.

<P>WE have heard the Propo&s;ition that your Ex|cellencies made to us two days &s;ince, contain|ing
<PB N="146" REF="81"> in &s;ub&s;tance, That the Lords, the States Gene|ral, could not carry on the War any longer, and found them&s;elves obliged to make Peace, for &s;uch Rea&s;ons as were then more particularly deduced. Your Excellencies would then have known our Sen|timents thereupon, and you de&s;ire the &s;ame thing again at this pre&s;ent. Not to fail therein, we hope above all things, that your Excellencies and all the World will do his Imperial Maje&s;ty the ju&s;tice to believe, that he has always behav'd him&s;elf like a good and faithful Ally towards all, both in Peace and War. We will not enlarge upon that. His Army has always been &s;een in the Field, in great numbers, in good order; it is evident, that he has imploy'd it for the good of the common Cau&s;e, and that he has made it act in &s;uch places as were thought mo&s;t &s;urable; 'twere needle&s;s to particula|rize the Campagnes, where all was acted for the publick good. Moreover, his Imperial Maje&s;ty has a&s;&s;i&s;ted his Allies with all the Forces he could, if not with all he would: The Rebellion that has been rai&s;ed again&s;t him in <HI>Hungary,</HI> is al&s;o publickly known, and how both his own Subjects, and the <HI>Turk</HI> and the <HI>Tartar</HI> have been &s;tirred up again&s;t him; and yet &s;o evident and &s;o near a danger, has not been able to divert or decrea&s;e his Forces for the common Intere&s;ts. Be&s;ides, that it is known, he hath &s;ent his Army into the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> to &s;upport the acting there, whereby the Enemy had an opportunity to take <HI>Friburg</HI> from him, which makes &s;o much difficulty now. As his Maje&s;ty has been intent upon the Affairs of the War, &s;o he has been no le&s;s upon tho&s;e of Peace: And, as your Excellencies can bear us witne&s;s, we his Amba&s;&s;a|dors have neglected nothing that might promote it;
<PB N="147" REF="81"> and becau&s;e we believed, that the mo&s;t effectual mean to obtain a rea&s;onable Peace, was to act vi|gorou&s;ly, we have done all we could, as hath been already &s;aid.</P>
<P>For the pre&s;ent, it cannot be doubted, but the Emperour will under&s;tand with &s;orrow, That your Excellencies think Affairs reduced to &s;uch extremi|ties, that there is a nece&s;&s;ity of making a Peace, to prevent greater: Your Excellencies have told us your Sentiments thereupon, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> theirs. As for our own, we find, in the fir&s;t place, That this manner of acting from <HI>France,</HI> to pre|&s;cribe Conditions of Peace, and admit no Treaties upon them, is again&s;t the &s;tyle and the cu&s;tom al|ways practis'd among Soveraign Powers; and we are far from being able to di&s;cover by that, any &s;uch de&s;ire of Peace, as the <HI>French</HI> make &s;o great o&s;ten|tation of. For the Peace it &s;elf, his Imperial Ma|je&s;ty de&s;ires it as much as any, and de&s;ires it may be general, that the publick repo&s;e may be obtain'd, which is his only aim, and the common &s;afety al&s;o, which is the chief thing that ought to be procur'd by the &s;aid Peace. Your Excellencies confe&s;s your &s;elves, that the Conditions contain'd in the Decla|ration of <HI>France,</HI> are too hard and violent; you have told us likewi&s;e, that your meaning is not, that we ought to pa&s;s all the Contents of them. You have de&s;ired to know our Sentiments upon this Subject, tendring the Offices of the States General, for reducing them to terms of Equity; and we, for our parts, told you then the Rea&s;ons, why we can|not explain our &s;elves fully thereupon.</P>
<P>How&s;oever, we declar'd our &s;elves here in the A&s;|&s;embly, to the Heer Amba&s;&s;ador <HI>Haren,</HI> that we could not admit of the Alternative, that concerns
<PB N="148" REF="82"> the Emperour and the Empire, barely as it is ex|pre&s;&s;ed. We have often deduced the Rea&s;ons, as well why we cannot re&s;tore <HI>Philipsburg,</HI> as why we cannot leave <HI>Friburg</HI> in the hands of the <HI>French.</HI> We hope all the World will think them well ground|ed, and with all this we have not fail'd to acquaint the Emperour by a Courier Expre&s;s, who&s;e return we expect. In the mean time, being willing to leave nothing undone on our &s;ide, that may fur|ther the Peace, we again pray your Excellencies, to interpo&s;e tho&s;e good Offices which you offered us, to di&s;po&s;e the Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>France.</HI></P>

<PB N="150" REF="83"> the nece&s;&s;ity of Affairs, the lamentable condition of the <HI>Spani&s;h Low-Countries,</HI> the <HI>United Provinces</HI> not being able to rai&s;e &s;upplies, for defraying the exce&s;&s;ive expences of the War, what-ever hope we might have form'd to our &s;elves of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>England,</HI> being utterly vani&s;h'd, and the formida|ble Power of the Enemy, are now laid for a founda|tion, to the mea&s;ures that are to be taken to pre|vent that by Peace, which 'tis believ'd cannot be hindred by continuing the War. The King our Ma&s;ter could not under&s;tand the&s;e extremities, but with the utmo&s;t compa&s;&s;ion and perplexity of mind; and if he be thought capable of bringing any reme|dy on his &s;ide, we can give a&s;&s;urance on his behalf, that he will apply him&s;elf to it with the &s;ame gene|ro&s;ity, care and concern, out of which he has hi|therto made appear by the effects, that his only content and repo&s;e con&s;i&s;ts in the welfare of his Allies.</P>
<P>In the mean time, it is a very difficult thing to give any coun&s;el and advice, in a matter that &s;eems to be already determined, and which &s;ticks at no|thing but the formality of its execution.</P>
<P>On Saturday la&s;t, their Excellencies, the Amba&s;|&s;adors of the Lords the States General, declar'd to us, That their Ma&s;ters &s;aw no other mean to &s;ave them&s;elves from the ruine, which was like to drag them, through that of the <HI>Spani&s;h Low-Countries,</HI> into the utter &s;ubver&s;ion of their Common-wealth, than that of a &s;udden Peace. They told us, That the Lords Amba&s;&s;adors of <HI>France</HI> expre&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves di&s;pos'd, to conclude one &s;eparately with them, and all tho&s;e that &s;hould de&s;ire to come into it, they invited us to joyn with them in it, and at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;ur'd us, that &s;ince of nece&s;&s;ity they
<PB N="151" REF="83"> mu&s;t avoid the confu&s;ion, that the An&s;wer they &s;hould have to make to the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King, concerning the accepting a ce&s;&s;ation of Arms, would bring them into, they found them&s;elves obliged to make a Peace alone, to their own be&s;t advantage, before the end of this pre&s;ent Month, though we &s;hould not be able in that time to concur with them in it; this ce&s;&s;ation of Arms not being nece&s;&s;ary to them, for their own particular intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>What room is left then for any coun&s;el or advice in the Ca&s;e? We &s;ee no other mea&s;ures to take, for what concerns the King our Ma&s;ter, than to put their Excellencies, the Amba&s;&s;adors of the Lords the States General, in mind of their own A&s;&s;ertion, to wit, That this Peace, even though they &s;hould &s;ee them&s;elves obliged to make it with <HI>France,</HI> &s;hould keep the Lords, the States General, their Ma&s;ters, no le&s;s under the power of their engagements, at the bottom of the mutual Treaties betwixt them and their Allies, and to pray them, as we do mo&s;t in|&s;tantly, to proceed in it with &s;uch caution and wi&s;|dom, as that it may not at the &s;ame time involve any prejudicial con&s;equence to that of the North.</P>
<P>The 18th Article of the Treaty betwixt his Ma|je&s;ty, and the Lords the States General, upon the occa&s;ion of the pre&s;ent War, &s;hews plainly, how far his Maje&s;ty and they &s;tand mutually engaged to one another. We are bound in duty to in&s;i&s;t upon it, till we have received Orders from our Ma&s;ter to di&s;pence with it, which of our own heads we cannot do; and we conjure the Lords the States General, by what-ever is mo&s;t &s;acred in the publick Faith, and in &s;uch &s;olemn &s;tipulations, not to do or take in hand any thing that may derogate from its force.</P>
<PB N="152" REF="84">
<P>We wi&s;h for the Peace, as much as it can be wi&s;h'd for, and envy it not our Allies; if they will &s;hew us a way to obtain a &s;ure and honourable Peace, we embrace it from this day forward; and if <HI>France</HI> will make a Peace with his Maje&s;ty, we believe he is altogether ready to accept it, &s;o it be founded up|on Rea&s;on, and the good union, which will always keep him in&s;eparable from the fortune of his Al|lies.</P>
<P>Finally, We pray God to in&s;pire always the Lords the States General with Coun&s;els worthy their moderation, and the con&s;ideration which they ought to have, for tho&s;e whom them&s;elves have drawn in|to the perils of the pre&s;ent War, and to ble&s;s their De&s;igns and Advances, for the &s;ecurity of the gene|ral Quiet of all Chri&s;tendom.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A Declaration of the Amba&s;&s;ador of the</HI> Elector <HI>of</HI> Brandenburg, <HI>on Munday the</HI> 20th <HI>of</HI> June, 1678.</HEAD>
<P>THE Amba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Brandenburg</HI> &s;ays, That it was evident, that his Electoral Serenity his Ma&s;ter, before the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King took up Arms again&s;t their Hi. and Mi. the States General, failed not to do all he could to divert him, and that likewi&s;e &s;ince the fire of this War has been kindled, he has de&s;ired nothing more earne&s;tly, than to &s;ee it quench'd as &s;oon as might be, and the publick repo&s;e every where e&s;tabli&s;h'd; and that it was upon the &s;ole con&s;ideration of promoting the Peace, that his Electoral Serenity entred into &s;uch &s;trict Bonds with
<PB N="153" REF="84"> his Allies, and e&s;pecially with their Hi. and Mi. that he hath expos'd and &s;acrific'd his Per&s;on and E&s;tates for that, and hath enjoyn'd his Plenipoten|tiaries at this Congre&s;s, and renews his Orders time after time, to labour for a Peace with their utmo&s;t endeavours, according to the Alliances betwixt the Confederates, which pre&s;cribe a method to be ob|&s;erved for obtaining a general Peace, that was agreed on joyntly by them all. That their Excellencies, the Amba&s;&s;adors of their Hi. and Mi. alledged two days &s;ince, that their Lord&s;hips, the States, both in re&s;pect of the condition of their own Provinces, and that of others, find them&s;elves at pre&s;ent redu|ced to a nece&s;&s;ity of making a Peace with <HI>France,</HI> whether they will or no. That at the &s;ame time, to ob&s;erve their Alliances, they expre&s;s a de&s;ire to have their Allies joyn with them in it; but that withal they think them&s;elves nece&s;&s;itated, for the &s;aving their Common-wealth from the &s;hipwrack that threatens it, to make a Peace alone, or with|out the Confederates, in ca&s;e they cannot accept the Conditions that <HI>France</HI> hath pre&s;cribed; that there|upon they required the re&s;olution of their Allies with all &s;peed, that they might take their Mea&s;ures thereby, at the Con&s;ultation that is to be held this Week at the <HI>Hague.</HI></P>
<P>The Plenipotentiary Amba&s;&s;ador of his Electoral Serenity &s;ays to it, That he knows not what re&s;olu|tion his Ma&s;ter will take, for that he could not re|ceive In&s;tructions from him in &s;o &s;hort a time, upon the Declaration which the Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King de|livered on the fir&s;t of this Month of <HI>June,</HI> to the Heer Amba&s;&s;ador <HI>Van Beverning.</HI> That in the mean time he partly explain'd him&s;elf, as to his own private Sentiment, in the Memorial of the 10th of
<PB N="154" REF="85"> <HI>June,</HI> which he pre&s;ented to the Amba&s;&s;adors of their Hi. and Mi. and that he doubted not, but they made all due and fitting Reflexions thereupon. That for the re&s;t, he was fully per&s;waded, though &s;ome un|conquerable nece&s;&s;ity might di&s;pence with the States General, or &s;hould oblige them to depart from any point of their Alliance with his Electoral Serenity, that yet they will always proceed in it with &s;uch caution and &s;incerity, as the foundation may &s;ub&s;i&s;t notwith&s;tanding, and his Electoral Serenity be at no prejudice, nor the band of their friend&s;hip and good under&s;tanding to be weakned.</P>
<P>The &s;aid Amba&s;&s;ador added two Points, requiring the &s;aid Lords the States to con&s;ider them, when they &s;hould take this matter into con&s;ideration. The one, That <HI>France,</HI> in the Project of Peace, which its Amba&s;&s;adors propo&s;ed here, doth not mention any Conditions, upon which it is willing to make a Peace with his Electoral Serenity; whereas, on his behalf, there have been Propo&s;als made to that end, both with relation to <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> in&s;o|much that he knows not yet whether <HI>France</HI> will make any Peace with him&s;elf or no. The other, That the Conditions propos'd in that Project, with relation to <HI>Sweden,</HI> were &s;o abject, and even &s;o con|trary to what their Hi. and Mi. have engaged them|&s;elves to procure his Electoral Serenity, that it mu&s;t be believed, that <HI>France</HI> is not willing that a Peace &s;hould be made with <HI>Sweden,</HI> ina&s;much as their Hi. and Mi. that &s;ee there is no room left for his Electo|ral Serenity to enter into the Peace, in conjunction with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Finally, The &s;aid Amba&s;&s;ador promi&s;eth to com|municate the re&s;olution of his Mo&s;t Serene Ma&s;ter, upon the &s;aid Declaration of <HI>France,</HI> as &s;oon as he

<P>THis Declaration could not be opened at large, becau&s;e the Pre&s;ident Canon had only formed the <HI>Idea</HI> of it in his mind, and return'd but the night before from the <HI>Hague;</HI> he alledged that Journey, as an excu&s;e for his not having been pre|&s;ent at the la&s;t Conference, &s;aying, that he went to deliver the Lords the States General a Letter from his Ma&s;ter. Then he enlarged upon the in|ju&s;tice of the Alternatives, that were propo&s;ed by <HI>France,</HI> as Conditions of Peace: The fir&s;t, demand|ing a Country 35 miles in length, and 16 or 18 in breadth, with 26 Cities upon it, and 600 Burroughs and Villages: The other, depriving him of his Capital City, and the convenience of communica|tion with his own Country, by pretending to pa&s;s through &s;ome of the be&s;t of his High-ways. That both the&s;e Conditions were equally hard, he de|mon&s;trated by the Election that was left his Ma&s;ter to chu&s;e either. For the avoiding &s;uch Imperious Laws, he referr'd him&s;elf to the Alliances made be|tween their Imperial and Catholick Maje&s;ties, their Lord&s;hips the States General, and his late Uncle, and renewed &s;ince with his own per&s;on with all po&s;|&s;ible exten&s;ion, and withal recommended him&s;elf to the friend&s;hip and protection of all his Allies, con|cluding
<PB N="156" REF="86"> with a formal prote&s;tation, that he would re&s;olve rather to live bani&s;h'd from his Country, and entirely to maintain the Ju&s;tice of his Title, and have his Allies that had contracted with him, con|tinue under their ab&s;olute Engagements, than ever to return upon &s;uch hard Conditions, and &s;o &s;can|dalous to his Birth, and his undoubted Right of Succe&s;&s;ion, never having de&s;erv'd &s;o ill of <HI>France,</HI> as to be u&s;ed &s;o cruelly.</P>

<P>It is evident, with what care his Electoral Sereni|ty hath governed all his Actions, &s;o as not to give the lea&s;t ground of di&s;content to <HI>Sweden;</HI> and the &s;incerity, with which he has renew'd former Allian|ces with that Crown, is no le&s;s apparent, by his ap|plying them even to the pre&s;ent Conjunctures, for the avoiding all manner of mi&s;-under&s;tanding and rupture, which yet happened, by the violent Inva&s;i|on, made by the Army of <HI>Sweden,</HI> towards the end of the year, 1674. upon <HI>Marchia</HI> and <HI>Pomerania,</HI> directly again&s;t tho&s;e, for whom &s;uch &s;olemn Stipu|lations had been, and contrary to the liberty, which each Party had re&s;erv'd to them&s;elves, in the &s;aid Alliance: Which Inva&s;ion was the more unju&s;t, in|a&s;much as it was made at a time, when his Electoral Serenity, relying on the publick Faith, had &s;ent his Forces &s;o far off, that he was bu&s;ie with them in <HI>Al|&s;atia.</HI> The Lords the States condemn'd and di&s;liked this Proceeding no le&s;s, than all other Chri&s;tian Po|tentates

<P>A rational &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s is only capable of redre&s;&s;ing the&s;e mi&s;chiefs, and of bringing them back to more ju&s;t and decent Mea&s;ures, that have been led a&s;ide out of the way of their Duty and Engagements, by the &s;ecret Cabals of &s;ome private Per&s;ons, and the

<P>His Maje&s;ty can lo&s;e nothing by this means, but will be a gainer, by maintaining his Glory, his Ho|nour, and his Reputation.

And when they &s;hall have loo&s;en'd the &s;acred Band of the Allies, and di&s;|armed the neighbouring E&s;tates, who will hinder the re&s;t from falling under the dominion of a foreign Power, when-ever the Enemy &s;hall have a mind to it?

The Enemy's Arms have already got too fa&s;t hold of the&s;e Rampiers, of the neighbouring E&s;tates, for us to imagine, that they can be contented to &s;ee them entirely lo&s;t. For this cau&s;e the Amba&s;&s;adors, Plenipotentiaries, and Mi|ni&s;ters under-written, will not enlarge upon the de|bate of the&s;e Matters.
