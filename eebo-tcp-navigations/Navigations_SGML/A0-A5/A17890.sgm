<HEAD>A true report of a voyage made this la&s;t Summer, by a fleete of 73. &s;hippes, &s;ent forth at the commande and direction of the &s;tates generall of the vnited Prouinces, to the coa&s;t of Spaine and the Canarie-i&s;les.</HEAD>
<P><HI>_TVe&s;day</HI> the 25. daie of <HI>Maie</HI> the wind being Northe and Northe|ea&s;t, we in the fleete of <HI>Roterdam,</HI> being 20. &s;aile of &s;hips, the &s;unne beeing &s;outhewe&s;t and by we&s;t, came before <HI>Flu&s;hing,</HI> and anke|red neere vnto <HI>Cleiburch;</HI> our ge|nerall at his comming found the fleetes of North-<HI>Holland,</HI> and <HI>Zeland</HI> ready.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> the 26. daie wee remained there at anchor.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the 27. day of <HI>Maie,</HI> we tooke into our &s;hips (by the Generals commandement) two gen|tlemen and foure &s;ouldiours.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> the 28. of <HI>May, 1599.</HI> the wind being nor|therly, we waied our anchors, and &s;ailed from the <HI>Weelings</HI> with 73 &s;hips, hauing faire weather, &s;et|ting our cour&s;e we&s;t, &s;outhwe&s;t. Wee had 3. Ad|mirals in this fleete, whereof the chiefe Admirall was the &s;hip of <HI>William Derick&s;on Cloper,</HI> wherein was imbarked the honourable gentleman <HI>Peter Van Doe&s;t</HI> being generall of the fleete. This &s;hip was
<PB N="2" REF="3"> called the <HI>Orange,</HI> carying in her top a flag of O|range colour, vnder who&s;e &s;quadron were certaine Zelanders, with &s;ome &s;outh and north Hollanders; <HI>Ian Geerbrant&s;on</HI> caried the white flag, vnder whom the Zelanders and &s;hips of the <HI>Maze</HI> were appoin|ted. And <HI>Cornelius Ghelein&s;o~</HI> of <HI>Vly&s;hing</HI> wore in his maine top the blew flag, vnder whom were appoin|ted certaine &s;hips of the <HI>Maze</HI> with &s;ome north Hol|landers. Thus were wee deuided into &s;undry &s;qua|drons, but to what ende it was &s;o done, it is to me, and many others vnknowne.</P>
<P>Saturday the 29. of Maie, hauing &s;ight of <HI>Callis,</HI> y^e &s;hips lay to the lee ward, &amp; &s;taied for the rereward. The Lord generall &s;hot off a peece, and afterward hung out the princes flag, in &s;igne that the captains &s;hold come aboord him, pre&s;ently al the captains en|tred into their boates &amp; rowed aboord y^e General, at which time were two pinnaces &s;ent out of the fleet, whereof one was the Generals Pinnace, but vnto what place they &s;ailed, wee were altogether igno|rant. And when the boates rowed from the Gene|rall, &s;ome of them went aboord the victualers, and tooke out of them certaine fire-workes. The &s;unne &s;outhwe&s;t, the Generall di&s;charged an other peece of ordinance, and put out the Princes flag, where|vpon pre&s;ently the captaines went aboord him, and when our captaine returned, he had in his hande a letter clo&s;ed vp, which hee brought from the Gene|rall, and wee imagined that euery captaine had re|ceiued the like, and then wee &s;ailed altogether to|ward the higth of <HI>Blackne&s;&s;e,</HI> where wee anchored, (which cau&s;ed vs greatly to wonder, &s;eeing we had &s;o faire a wind,) but we perceiued afterwards, that this was done, to the ende we &s;hould there abide the comming of the great new &s;hip of <HI>Am&s;terdam;</HI> for the &s;oldiours which were appointed for her, were all with vs in a &s;hip of our company.</P>

<P>Sunday, the 30. of <HI>Maie,</HI> where lying at anchor al that night, the next morning we &s;et &s;aile altogether hauing the winde at north ea&s;t, wee &s;et our cour&s;e we&s;t north we&s;t, the weather being faire. The &s;ame morning our captain read vnto vs tho&s;e very arti|cles which before had bin read vnto vs in the prince <HI>Mauritz</HI> his Court, and afterwards we altogether; and with one accord were &s;worne to the keeping of them: At noone wee were neere vnto <HI>Beuer&s;ier,</HI> ha|uing a fine gale out of the ea&s;t north ea&s;t, the eue|ning was calme, the formo&s;t &s;hippes &s;lacked their &s;ailes, attending the comming in of the hindermo&s;t.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day, the ninth of Iune, by the breake of daie we were hard vnder the coa&s;t of <HI>Spaine</HI> neere to <HI>Viuero,</HI> the winde being we&s;terly, we &s;ailed north we&s;t and by north, and north northwe&s;t, the &s;unne &s;outhwe&s;t and by we&s;t; we were ouer again&s;t the cape <HI>Ortegael,</HI> we &s;ailed north we&s;t and by north, to fetch the wind: we were in 44. degrees 20. minuts, at twilight, we had the fore&s;aid Cape of vs about 5. miles &s;outh we&s;t and by we&s;t.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day the 10. of <HI>Iune,</HI> the winde being at ea&s;t &s;outh ea&s;t, wee directed our cour&s;e towardes the &s;hore, and might certainly di&s;cerne that it was the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ortegall</NOTE> coa&s;t of <HI>Ortegall,</HI> we bore in we&s;t &s;outhwe&s;t directly with the land, and ordered all thinges as if we pre|&s;ently &s;hould haue had battell, and about noone wee had fight of the <HI>Groyne,</HI> namely the tower which &s;tandeth neere the <HI>Groine.</HI></P>
<P>Friday, the 11. of <HI>Iune,</HI> at the breake of day the winde being at north ea&s;t and by ea&s;t, &s;ixe of our &s;hips &s;ailed forwarde &s;outh &s;outhwe&s;t, meaning to enter the <HI>Groine,</HI> and there to learne how al things &s;tood. The &s;unne being &s;outhea&s;t, Cape <HI>Prior</HI> was ea&s;t from vs, wee bare &s;outh, pre&s;ently after we &s;pi|ed two boates comming out of <HI>Veroll</HI> to learn what
<PB N="6" REF="4"> &s;hips we were, the rather becau&s;e that the day be|fore they had &s;eene our fleete at &s;ea: we &s;ailed by the wind, and lay in the wind to &s;tay for their comming. The one doubting vs woulde not come neere vs, the other boat al&s;o dur&s;t not approch neere vs: wee called to one of the Spaniardes, &s;aying wee came from <HI>Hamborch</HI> laden with cordage &amp; other goods, de&s;iring and praying him to let vs haue a Pilot to bring vs into the <HI>Groine,</HI> wherewith the boate came aboord vs, &s;o that by our great ha&s;te and poli|cie we got one Spaniard, the other which remai|ned in the boate would not come into our &s;hip, but pre&s;ently thru&s;t off their boate, making all po&s;&s;ible &s;peede to get from vs. Hauing nowe gotten this Spaniarde, hee was pre&s;ently deliuered into the handes of the Generall, who confe&s;&s;ed that there were about 4000. &s;ouldiours come into the towne, with certaine hor&s;emen, 36. waggons with money, and 300. pipes of wine, to furni&s;h the Spani&s;h fleet, that he lay the night pa&s;t in the <HI>Groine,</HI> and was the kings &s;eruant. The &s;un &s;outh &s;outh we&s;t, we came with our whole fleete before the <HI>Groyne,</HI> where wee<NOTE PLACE="marg">The whole fleet commeth before the <HI>Groine.</HI></NOTE> found the great newe &s;hip of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> vnder the Towne.</P>
<P>At 12. 13. and 10. fadome we ca&s;t anchor, &s;o that wee might behold much people both on the &s;hoare &amp; vpon the wals of the town. From the ca&s;tle &amp; town both, they &s;hot mightily with their great ordinance into our fleet, &s;o that there were aboue 200. cannon &s;hot di&s;charged, wherewith &s;ome of our &s;hips were hit, but not one man lo&s;t, and little hurt done other|wi&s;e. There lay an other ca&s;tle ea&s;t ward from the towne, which &s;hot al&s;o mo&s;t terribly, but altogether vncertainly, for we know not that they touched any one &s;hip more then <HI>Moy Lambert,</HI> which was great|ly to bee wondered at, &s;eeing our fleete lay &s;o thicke
<PB N="7" REF="4"> together, and &s;o neere vnder the ca&s;tle. There laie hard vnder the ca&s;tle 12. great Gallions, with &s;ome french &s;hips, which al&s;o nowe and then &s;hot among our fleete, but they lay &s;o neere the walles that wee could do them no harme at all. The Lord Generall worthy of al prai&s;e, wi&s;ely bethinking him&s;elfe, cau|&s;ed all his captaines and coun&s;ell to come aboorde him, that they might together conferre vpon this bu&s;ines, and what meanes might be&s;t bee found, to inuade the towne and the enemy, but they conclu|ded, not to meddle with the land there: &s;eeing the enemy was there, &s;trong vpon his guard, and that 5. weekes pa&s;t both from Am&s;terdam, &amp; by a French man, they had knowledge of our co~ming; by rea&s;on of the calme, wee were con&s;trained to towe out our &s;hips with the boates in di&s;pite of al their &s;hot, thus we parted from the <HI>Groyne</HI> without profit, or effec|ting of any thing, leauing the Papi&s;ts of <HI>Groyne</HI> as wee founde them. From thence (the winde being at &s;outh &s;outhwe&s;t) wee bent our cour&s;e towarde Cape <HI>Saint Vincent,</HI> meaning to goe to <HI>Saint Lucars,</HI> hoping to fal vpon them at vnawares, and ere they looked for vs.</P>
<P>Saturday the 12. of Iune, hauing got a fine gale we ran along the coa&s;t of <HI>Galicia,</HI> at noone wee were before the Iland of <HI>Ce&s;arian,</HI> and &s;et our cour&s;e to|wards Cape <HI>Fini&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>Sunday the 13. of Iune, the lorde Generall gaue &s;harpe commandement by his letters, forbidding al men aboorde the &s;hips to v&s;e any play, with tables, cards, or dice, either for money, or for pa&s;time, or vpon credit.</P>
<P>Munday the 14. of <HI>Iune,</HI> the wind blew &s;o harde out of the North, that wee could not be are our top|&s;ailes with our forecour&s;e which &s;ailed &s;outh, the &s;unne was &s;outhward, we had Port a Porte of vs,
<PB N="6" REF="5"> being in 41. degrees and 20. minuts.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day the 15. of Iune, as &s;oone as day appea|red, we had &s;ight of Cape <HI>Roxent,</HI> and then we &s;ailed making &s;mall way, &s;taying for the comming toge|ther of the fleete: the wind as before, we &s;ailed &s;outh &s;outhwe&s;t, and were in 36. degrees.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day the 16. of Iune, towardes the eue|ning we had &s;ight of two &s;trange &s;hips ea&s;tward of our fleete, certain of our &s;hips made towards them and tooke them, the one was an engli&s;h man of war; the other was a Spani&s;h barke with three mi&s;&s;ens: at his comming before the Generall, he &s;aid, he had already &s;ent 2. pri&s;es into Englande, and woulde now with this pri&s;e returne home: for his victuals were almo&s;t &s;pent.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day the 17. of Iune, it was very &s;till and calme weather.</P>
<P>Friday the 18. of Iune, the wind being at north northea&s;t, we &s;ailed &s;outh &s;outhwe&s;t. The Lord Ge|nerall cau&s;ed all the Captaines with the Pilots to come aboord him: demanding of them which of them was be&s;t acquainted in the Iles of <HI>Canaria:</HI> and further, by what meanes they might conquer and force the &s;aid Ilands, and land their people. And a|but noone the captaines were cho&s;en and appointed which &s;houlde commande on lande. The Generall gaue out newe en&s;ignes, to the number of 9. or 10. according to the number of the &s;hips. The lord Ge|nerall appointed to each new captaine, an Antient bearer, a Lieutenant, and other officers, with 130. &s;ouldiours and mariners, and in&s;tructions how e|uery one of them &s;hould gouerne him&s;elf on the land.</P>
<P>Saturday the 19. of Iune, the Generall com|manded that the captaines &s;hould deliuer out vic|tuals but twice a day; to wit, 6. and 6. to a me&s;&s;e: for 6. men, 5. cans of beere of <HI>Roterdams</HI> mea&s;ure euery
<PB N="7" REF="5"> day, 5. pounde of breade and no more, a chee&s;e of 6. l. euery weeke, one pound of butter weekely, likewi&s;e pea&s;e, beanes, or Otemeale twi&s;e a day, according to the order. Captaine <HI>Harman,</HI> and captaine <HI>Pijc,</HI> had each of them commi&s;&s;ion to commande on the land as captaines ouer two companies of &s;aylers, each company containing 130. men. <HI>Harman Thu|ne&s;&s;on</HI> was appointed Ancient to captaine <HI>Henricke Pijc,</HI> and <HI>de Blomme</HI> Ancient to captaine <HI>Hendricke Hertma~.</HI> The ancients were deliuered the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>The 20. 21. 22. daies, wee &s;ailed &s;outh &s;outhwe&s;t, the wind being northerly.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day the 23. of Iune, the wind was north northea&s;t. The Generall commaunded all the cap|taines both for the &s;ea and land to come aboord him, where it was ordained and determined how the bat|tell &s;hould be ordered, after they were landed. Ac|cording to the altitude, we found our &s;elues to be 36 miles from great <HI>Canaria.</HI></P>
<P>Thur&s;day the 24. of Iune, we ranne our fore&s;aid cour&s;e. The &s;un being we&s;t northwe&s;t, we &s;awe the land ea&s;t and by &s;outh off vs: wee &s;ailed ea&s;t and by &s;outh, and with great labour and diligence bore all that might with the land.</P>
<P>Friday the 25. of Iune, we continued our cour&s;e to the land for our a&s;&s;ured knowledge thereof, and perceiued it to be <HI>Lancerot;</HI> we &s;aw al&s;o a &s;mall land (which lay between both) called <HI>Allegrania,</HI> and al&s;o y^e Iland <HI>Forteue~tura,</HI> which is 24. miles great, after|ward we &s;ailed &s;outhwe&s;t along the coa&s;t of <HI>Forte|uentura,</HI> which is a lande that hath very high hils. The &s;un &s;outhwe&s;t, we were pa&s;t the Iland <HI>Forteue~+tura,</HI> and were &s;ailed out of &s;ight thereof, running as yet &s;outhwe&s;t: about ii. a clocke in the afternoone wee had &s;ight of the Iland of great <HI>Canaria,</HI> for a while wee kept our way; but when the Generall
<PB N="8" REF="6"> was a&s;&s;ured that it was the grand <HI>Canaria,</HI> wee all<NOTE PLACE="marg">The whole Netherlandi&s;h fleet commeth before the I|&s;land &amp; town of Grand Ca|naria.</NOTE> tooke in our &s;ailes, and lay to the lee ward, and &s;o re|mained vntill it was pa&s;t midnight, then wee &s;et &s;aile againe and made to the lande, our cour&s;e we&s;t|warde.</P>
<P>Saturday the 26. of Iune, in the morning the whole fleet &s;ailed we&s;t directly to the land, the winde north and by ea&s;t, and made all thinges ready to land; being now neere the &s;hore, the whole fleete let fall their anchors harde by the great ca&s;tle, which lieth north northwe&s;t from the town, from whence they began to &s;hoot mightily again&s;t the &s;hips. The lord Generall and the vize Admirall with the other &s;hips that had the greate&s;t ordenance, anchored clo&s;e vnder the ca&s;tle, &amp; for a certain time they plied each other with their great &s;hot; y^e Generals main ma&s;t, and his mi&s;&s;en ma&s;t were &s;hot thorow, and his vize Admirall, namely the great new &s;hip of <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> was &s;hot thorow 6. or 7. times; &s;o that &s;ome of the &s;ouldiours and maryners al&s;o were &s;laine before they entered their long beates to rowe to the &s;hore: But the &s;hips for their parts, had &s;o well be&s;towed their &s;hot on the ca&s;tle, that they of the ca&s;tle began to faint, wherby they di&s;charged not &s;o thicke and often as before. Our men rowed to the land in the long boates, euery one full of &s;oldiours, &amp; the &s;hips which could not di&s;charge their ordenance again&s;t the ca&s;tle, bent them again&s;t the &s;hore, (for the ene|my had three bra&s;&s;e peeces lying vpon the &s;trand) and many people were there gathered together where our &s;ouldiours &s;houlde land. Nowe as &s;oone as the Generall with the mo&s;t parte of the long boates were come together, they all at one in&s;tant rowed toward the &s;hore, maintaining for a while the fight on both &s;ides with their &s;hot. But the General per|ceiuing that the enemie woulde not abandon the
<PB N="9" REF="6"> place, with a baliant courage made to the &s;hore, and altogether leaping into the water vp to the middle, maintained the fight with the enemy. Notwith|&s;tanding the enemy no le&s;&s;e couragious, would not yet leaue the &s;trond, &s;o that &s;ome of our &s;ouldiours &amp; mariners lo&s;t their liues before the enemy would retire: for the place was di&s;commodious, and hard to lande; but mo&s;t of the enemy were &s;laine, to the number of 30. or 36. and the Gouernor his right leg was &s;hot off, &s;itting on his hor&s;e. The lord General <HI>Peter von der Doe&s;t</HI> leaping fir&s;t on land, was thru&s;t in his leg with a pike, and had in his body 4. wounds more, and was in great danger to haue lo&s;t his life, but that one of the &s;oldiours &s;lewe the Spaniarde which meant to haue don it; but his wounds were of &s;mall moment, and his ancient bearer was &s;lain with a &s;hot, the Lieutenant Generall was &s;hot in his throte, captaine <HI>Kruyc</HI> in the heade, 4. &s;oldiours were &s;lain, &amp; 15. hurt in the generals pinnace before they could come to land: But when our people now with one courage all together ru&s;hed vpon the ene|mie, (leauing their ordenance behinde them,) they for&s;ooke the &s;trond, and ran together into the town, carying with them their Gouernour, who&s;e leg was &s;hot off, &amp; he was a Knight of the order of the cro&s;&s;e, and leauing behind them 36. deade carca&s;es on the &s;trond, were pre&s;ently by our people ran&s;acked, and our dead people buried. Our men now hauing won the &s;trond, put them&s;elues pre&s;ently in battell ray; the empty boates returned to the &s;hips, but after our people had taken the &s;trond, the ca&s;tle did neuer &s;hoot &s;hot. After the boates were returned aboord, pre&s;ently they rowed againe to the &s;hore full of &s;ol|diours; our people being all landed, they which for<NOTE PLACE="marg">Twenty f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters"> companie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;trong of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"> Netherln~<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"></NOTE> the fir&s;t time had co~mandement, &s;et vs in 7. troupes, or battalions, being xxiiii. companies &s;trong, of &s;ol|diours

Iron peeces, &amp; al&s;o al their weapo~s. In the ca&s;tle were about 80. Spaniards, &s;ome cannoniers, &s;ome &s;oldiors, and &s;ome people of the countrey, for the defence thereof; be&s;ide powder, &s;hot and match accordingly, for the artillery, and al&s;o thirty &s;mall peeces or caliuers. Al&s;o wee founde 58. pri&s;oners, the re&s;t were &s;laine with &s;hot in the fury, and &s;ome were run away. The pri&s;oners (which our people had taken in the road with two Barkes, and a &s;hip &s;unke with our orde|nance, as they lay all 3. hard before the ca&s;tle) were &s;ent altogether aboorde the &s;hips: except 3. of the principals which the lord General re&s;erued by him, to the end he might the better knowe the &s;tate of all things. Pre&s;ently 80. &s;oldiours were &s;ent into the ca&s;tle, who tooke down the kings flag, and &s;et vp the princes colours. At the &s;ame in&s;tant two Negros were brought to y^e General, which were fetched out of the mountains, they &s;aid that they had lien there a &s;leepe, and knew nothing of any matter. But now when it began to wax dark, we marched altogether a great way towards the town, 4. companies of &s;ol|diors approched hard vnder the towne, and other 4. co~panies had the rereward: tho&s;e of the <HI>Maze,</HI> with the <HI>Am&s;terdammers</HI> remained a pretty way from the

<P>Sunday the 27. of Iune, after we had now &s;tood al night in battel order, early in the morning we mar+ched w^h al our 7. troupes hard vnder the town of <HI>Ca+narie,</HI> where we remained a while in that order: but becau&s;e they of the ca&s;tle (which lieth to the towne) &s;hot &s;o mightily among vs; 2 of the troupes retired vnder a hill, where we were a little freede from the ca&s;tle: for while our people &s;tood imbattailed before the town, the ca&s;tle did vs great hurt, for &s;omtimes they &s;hot fiue or &s;ixe men with one &s;hot, ere we could entrench our &s;elues before the ca&s;tle: but after they perceiued that our people had made a &s;mall trench again&s;t the &s;hot of the ca&s;tle, they placed on the hill fiue or &s;ixe &s;mall peeces of bra&s;&s;e called falconets (which &s;hoote about a pounde of pouder) and &s;ome|times they &s;hot boules of wood, wherewith in the beginning they &s;lew manie of our people: &s;o aduan|tagiou&s;lie had they placed their ordenaunce to &s;hoot among vs. Ten or twelue of our Souldi|ours ranne vp the hill, whereof the enemy tooke one, and pre&s;ently cut him in foure peeces. Our people &s;eeing that they &s;o tyranou&s;lie dealte with them, about the euening tooke a Spaniarde pri&s;o|ner, and v&s;ed him after the &s;ame maner. The lorde Generall perceiuing that many men were &s;laine with the ordenance, cau&s;ed fiue peeces of bra&s;&s;e to bee brought from the ca&s;tle which we had taken the daie before, and toward the euening we beganne to make a battery, and the &s;ame euening brought into it three peeces, whereof two were placed pre&s;entlie to play vppon the Ca&s;tle, and the hill: but that e|uening were but fiue or &s;ixe &s;hotte made. While that our men made the batterie, and planted or
<PB N="12" REF="8"> placed the ordenaunce, the enemy placed his orde|nance in counter-battery: and before our battery could be fini&s;hed, and the ordenance placed, many of our men were &s;hot, among who~ <HI>Peter vanden Eynde</HI> commi&s;&s;ioner, had his leg &s;hot off, whereof he died within three daies after. After that it was dark, al they which lay there before the towne were againe &s;et in order of battel, 15. on a ranke, and &s;o remai|ned all that night.</P>
<P>The 28. of Iune, early in the morning euery man retired to his quarter, and then were two peeces more brought to the battery, which al&s;o were pre|&s;ently placed on the Rampire, and &s;o wee began to &s;hoot again&s;t the ca&s;tle with 4. peeces, and with the fifth we plaied vpon the &s;mall ordenance which lay vpon the hils. The enemy in the ca&s;tle laid manie &s;ackes of wooll, and placed many tonnes or barrels filled with &s;tones vpon the ca&s;tle walles, &s;uppo&s;ing thereby to make &s;ome little defence from our orde|nance; but when an Iron bullet chanced to hit the barrels &s;o filled with &s;tones, it did them mightie hurt, for the &s;tones would &s;catter maruailou&s;lie a|broad, whereby many of them that were in the ca|&s;tle were &s;laine. Our men hauing now with their &s;hot almo&s;t abated the force of the ca&s;tle, 4. compa|nies marched vp the hils, intending to beate the e|nemy from thence, which lay there with the orde|nance. But the enemy perceiuing him&s;elfe to bee a&s;&s;aulted on all partes, (for mo&s;t of the ordenance of the ca&s;tle were di&s;mounted and made vnprofitable, the gate of the towne &s;et one fire by the Generals commandement) about noone they for&s;ooke both the ca&s;tle, hill, and town, and with all their wiues, chil|dren, money and Iewels, and all other things that they coulde carry with them, fled into the moun|taines. Which when our men perceiued, they put
<PB N="13" REF="8"> them&s;elues in order of battell, xv. in a ranke. The lord Generall &s;eeing the Spaniards &s;hamefullie to flie, cau&s;ed 2. ladders belonging to the enemies, to be brought out of a church which &s;tood without the towne, whereof the one was too &s;horte, notwith|&s;tanding him&s;elfe with one of the ladders climed vp<NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;econd ca&s;tle &amp; t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters"> of Grand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters">+naria tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="2 letters"></NOTE> the walles, one man at once followed, and by this meanes entered the towne ouer the wals. About noone &s;ome of our men ran into the ca&s;tle without a|ny reencou~ter: the enemy had vndermined the gate, but as we approched the wall, it tooke fire, but not one of our people was therewith hurt. they had al&s;o &s;kattered powder in &s;undrie places, but our men them&s;elues did fire the &s;ame: and as &s;oone as our people were entred the ca&s;tle, the Kinges colours were taken downe, and the prince of <HI>Orenges</HI> &s;et vp, and we found fiue peeces of bra&s;&s;e therein. When wee were all entered into the towne, we put our &s;elues againe into order of battell 15. in a ranke in a low ground within the towne: and the &s;ouldiours which entered the towne by the hils &s;ide, brought to the Generall a man of <HI>Flu&s;hing,</HI> which they had taken out of pri&s;on: as &s;oone as the Generall &s;awe him, he went pre&s;ently with him to the pri&s;on, ac|companied with &s;ome of our captaines, where they found 36. pri&s;oners, which pre&s;ently were di&s;char|ged. And further they declared, that the &s;paniards had taken with them 2. pri&s;oners into the moun|taines, which were condemned to be burnt, the one was an engli&s;h man, the other a dutchman, which had lien in the holy hou&s;e. Thus with the helpe of God about noone, wee won the great Iland of <HI>Ca|naria,</HI> and the town of <HI>Allegona,</HI> battered with their owne artillery, and &s;kaled with their owne ladders. Towards the euening wee were quartered in the hou&s;en, tho&s;e wherein the Generall was, were by
<PB N="14" REF="9"> writing freed, that no man might take out any goods, in the re&s;t euery one might go, and take what pillage he could find: but the Spaniards had caried all the be&s;t things with them into the mountaines, and in the euening all our people entered the town. Euery captaine with his company were &s;euerallie lodged, but yet we appointed watch on the hils, as well as in the towne, for the enemy &s;hewed him&s;elfe often vpon the hils, whereby we were forced to keep very good watch.</P>
<P>The 29. of Iune, this morning &s;ome of the mari|ners climed vp the hils, but the enemy (to whom the pa&s;&s;age were better known, then to our people) &s;ud|dainly &s;et vpon them, &amp; killed 20. of them. Towards the euening &s;ome 300. of our Soldiours marched towardes a &s;mall ca&s;tle which lay halfe an houres iourney from the towne: but the enemy &s;eeing our people to approch, for&s;ooke the place and fled into the mountaines, our men being a&s;cended, they founde in the ca&s;tle three bra&s;&s;e peeces; and after they had appointed a Corporall with certaine &s;oldiours to keepe the watch, the re&s;t returned to the citty. The &s;ame night the Spaniards tooke one of our &s;oldiors appointed for a forlorne Sentinel, whom they pre|&s;ently put to the &s;word.</P>
<P>The la&s;t of Iune, as &s;oone as day appeared, wee began to carry the pillage aboorde belonging to the General, and captaines, as wines and other goods. About noone 3. cheefe men of the Spaniards came to our people, which kept watch on the hils with a flag of truce in their handes, which were &s;traight brought before the Generall, and within a while af|ter, there were 2. more brought vnto him: but after they had bin a while with him they departed again towards the mountaines: and in the euening came other 7. Spaniardes to our watch with a flag of
<PB N="17" REF="9"> truce, de&s;ired to &s;peake with the Generall: but they were &s;ente backe againe into the Moun|taynes.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t day of Iuly, 1599. in the morning (our people being on the hils) 2. Friers with three other Spaniards came vnto vs, de&s;iring to be brought to the Generall, which our men accompli&s;hed: but the General denied to talke with them, wherefore they were pre&s;ently &s;ent backe againe from whence they came, for we were then labouring to &s;end the goods a &s;hipboord. Al&s;o at that in&s;tant was a &s;ermon in the great church of great <HI>Canaria,</HI> made by the prea|cher of <HI>Y&s;ilmond</HI> with great deuotion, and giuing thanks vnto God for our great victory, de&s;iring him that it would plea&s;e him daily to increa&s;e the &s;ame, to the honour of his name: at which Sermon the Lorde Generall was pre&s;ent with foure hundred per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The &s;econd of Iuly, 1599. wee were forbidden by &s;ounde of the drum, that no man &s;hould go beyond the forlorne &s;entenell placed on the Mountaines: and to &s;ende backe againe into the hilles all &s;uch Spaniardes which came with a flag of truce, to &s;peake with the Generall, and to put all &s;uch to the &s;worde as came with weapons. One of our Pin|naces tooke a Fi&s;herman fi&s;hing vnder the Ilande <HI>Forteauentura,</HI> wherin were 7. Spaniardes, which were brought before the General, and prently com|mitted to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>The 3. of Iuly in the morning we began to &s;ende aboord our &s;hips all the bels, ordenance &amp; munition which the enemies had left behinde them, at which time 2000. &s;oldiors were appointed to march to the hils, to &s;eeke the enemy, which lay hid there with their wiues, children &amp; goods, as they were fled out of the towne: and a&s;&s;oone as they approched each
<PB N="16" REF="10"> other, they began the fight on both &s;ides with great courage, out the enemy was forced to flie, beeing better acquainted with the pa&s;&s;ages of the moun|tains then our people were. our men returned with the lo&s;&s;e of &s;ome 70. per&s;ons: among whom captain <HI>Iacques Dierick&s;on</HI> with his boat&s;on were &s;laine: the re&s;t came into the towne againe into their appoin|ted quarters.</P>
<P>The 4. of Iuly, in the morning we began to burn the towne, and with pouder blewe vp the ca&s;tle which lay by the towne, and we burned likewi&s;e all the cloi&s;ters and churches which were without the towne, lying neere the water &s;ide. The town bur|ning, our people were &s;et in battell, and in that or|der marched out of the towne, vntill they came to <HI>Gratio&s;a,</HI> the ca&s;tle, which we fir&s;t tooke, lying about halfe an houres iourney from the towne, where the long boates receiued our men, and caried them a|gaine aboorde. Pre&s;ently after wee were departed out of the towne, the enemy entered, endeuoring by all meanes po&s;&s;ible to quench the fire. And while we were &s;hipping our people, the enemy &s;hewed him &s;elfe &s;ome times 5. or 6. in a company, but they dur&s;t not approch vs. The rereward of our men be|ing &s;hipped, we put fire to the ca&s;tle which we tooke fir&s;t, and blew it vp: This done, captaine <HI>Quit</HI> im|barked him&s;elfe al&s;o with his &s;oldiours, and pillage which he had taken in the rode, for his &s;hip wherein he was before was ready to &s;inke.</P>
<P>The 5. of Iuly, lying in the roade, in the mor|ning the Generall di&s;charged two peeces of orde|nance, and afterward put out 2. flags of the princes colours, thereby giuing to vnder&s;tand, that all land captaines, and &s;ea captaines al&s;o with one of their Pilots &s;hould re&s;ort to him, whereupon pre&s;entlie they all rowed aboorde the Generall; the Pilots
<PB N="17" REF="10"> which were be&s;t acquainted with the coa&s;t, were demanded by the Generall which were the weake&s;t Ilands, and where they might mo&s;t commodiou&s;lie land: Towards the euening captaine <HI>Quvt</HI> his &s;hip was fired, and &s;uffered to driue towarde the &s;trond. At which time a newe captaine was appointed to captaine <HI>Iaques Dirrik&s;ons</HI> &s;hip afore&s;aide, who was &s;laine in the mountaines, namely captaine <HI>Kloyers</HI> Lieutenant. And the Generals Clarke of the band was appointed Lieuetenant to captain <HI>Kloyer.</HI></P>
<P>The 6. of Iuly, by rea&s;on of the contrary winds, and other inconueniences which happened at this pre&s;ent, and al&s;o becau&s;e &s;uch &s;hips, which before were &s;ent to &s;ea, and could not returne by rea&s;on of the contrary windes; we remained in the road, vn|der the ca&s;tle of <HI>Gracio&s;a.</HI> About noone 4. Spani|ards came out of the towne with a flag of truce to the &s;trond, directly ouer again&s;t our &s;hips, whereof 2. were brought aboorde the Generall in one of our long boates, (the other two with their flag of truce were left behinde on the &s;tronde) which remained with the Generall vntil the euening, and then were &s;et on &s;hore, and &s;o the 4. Spaniardes returned to the towne.</P>
<P>The 7. day riding in the roade, in the morning 4. Spaniards with a flag of peace, came to the &s;hore from the towne, directly ouer again&s;t our &s;hips: the fleet &s;eeing them, &s;ent a long boate to the &s;hore, and brought the &s;aid 4. Spaniards aboord the General, the&s;e men brought with them the ran&s;ome of cer|taine Spaniards, which had deliuered vp the ca&s;tle of <HI>Gracio&s;a</HI> at the Generals plea&s;ure, which were &s;et to ran&s;ome, euery one according to his habilitie &amp; office: and thus all the Spaniardes which were ran&s;omed, together with the 4. &s;paniardes which brought the ran&s;oms, were &s;et on &s;hore with a long
<PB N="16" REF="11"> boate, and departed to the towne.</P>
<P>The 8. day of Iuly, two howers after &s;un ri&s;ing, the Generall with all the &s;hips &s;et &s;aile, carying with him all the Spaniardes that were not ran&s;o|med, &s;ailing alo~g the coa&s;t of great <HI>Canaria;</HI> in which time <HI>Ian Cornele&s;&s;on Zwartekeys</HI> departed this worlde, who&s;e leg was &s;hot off at the taking of the Iland of great <HI>Canaria.</HI> Hauing nowe &s;ailed from y^e hight of the &s;aid Iland, which lay &s;outherly from vs, we had &s;ight of captaine <HI>Hertmans</HI> &s;hip, and of 3. others which rode there at anchor: who, &s;o &s;oone as they perceiued our fleete, waied their anchors, and &s;ailed along the coa&s;t with vs, which were the &s;hips that the Generall had &s;ent to &s;ea. Sailing thus together vntill the &s;un was in the we&s;t, the wind began to ri&s;e more and more, &s;o that we coulde not keep our direct cour&s;e, but were forced to put to the &s;outhwe&s;t of the great Iland of <HI>Canaria,</HI> where we anchored: wee had &s;ight of the Iland <HI>Teneriffa,</HI> and of an other of the Ilands of <HI>Canaria,</HI> wherein is the hie mountaine called the <HI>Pyck.</HI> This hil was from vs 14. miles, but by the great hight thereof it &s;eemed to bee within foure or fiue miles off vs, but in the daie time when the &s;un &s;hined wee could not &s;ee it.</P>
<P>The 9. of Iuly, lying thus at anchor, in the mor|ning mo&s;t of the long boates went a &s;hore to fetch fre&s;h water, &s;uch as they could there find, and caried with them the deade corps of <HI>Ian Cornele&s;&s;on</HI> afore|&s;aid, the Con&s;tables &s;on of the Admiralty of <HI>Roterda~,</HI> called <HI>Zwertkeys,</HI> which was there honorably bu|ried on the high and drie land. This done, we &s;et on fire the woode which lay on the &s;hore piled and he a|ped in the woods, but in this place we found not a|ny Spaniards.</P>
<P>The tenth of Iuly, the boates being all returned
<PB N="21" REF="11"> to their &s;hips with their people, euery one wayed their anchors and hoi&s;ed their &s;ailes, the winde at northwe&s;t; but being vnder &s;aile together, the wind flacked, &amp; by rea&s;on of the great calme the &s;hips lay a drift for want of wind.</P>
<P>The 11. of Iuly, in the morning it blewe a &s;tout gale in our top&s;ailes out of the northea&s;t, but as we approched the Iland of <HI>Teneriffa,</HI> the winde altered often; &s;ixe or &s;euen of our &s;hippes, and the re&s;t which were next vnto the &s;hore, had &s;ometimes a gale in their top&s;ailes, and &s;ometimes againe without wind: &s;o that we lay a drift, and could keepe no rec|koning either of the wind or cour&s;e, and were forced to alter our cour&s;e more then 12. times a day.</P>

<P>_THe 12. day of Iuly failing thus with great variety of wind, vnder the great Ila~d <HI>Teneriffa,</HI> the day appearing, we had the wind more certain, filling our top&s;ailes with a full gale from the northwe&s;t: And when it was faire day light we &s;aw our fleet &s;cattred far one fro~ another, by meanes of the fore&s;aid mutable windes. Some &s;hips lay driuing by rea&s;on of the calme, and other &s;ome had a little gale, but the mo&s;t part of our fleet were we&s;t of vs, towards whom with all &s;peed, we with the re&s;t of the &s;hips made. Being al come toge|ther, wee endeuored to reach the Ilande <HI>Gomera,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="12"> wherein is a little towne: towardes the euening many of our &s;hips were neere the Iland, but the mo&s;t part were to y^e lee ward; &s;o that before it grew toward the euening none of vs could come neere the towne. Notwith&s;tanding in the twilight and &s;hut|ting vp of the euening: <HI>Ian Garbrant&s;on</HI> Admirall of the white flag, his vize Admirall, and a Pinnace following, were come neere the town.

The other &s;hips which were behinde, laboured all they might to come al&s;o vnder the Iland to them.</P>
<P>The 13. of Iuly, the Admiral of the white flag ly|ing thus at anchor neere to <HI>Gomera,</HI> the greate&s;t part of the fleete were yet in the morning betweene the Iland of <HI>Teneriffa</HI> and <HI>Gomera,</HI> &s;o that parte of the &s;hips were beyonde the towne, and mu&s;t &s;ome|times ca&s;t about to conducte the others in, which were in the lee of vs. When wee had nowe for the mo&s;t part pa&s;&s;ed the hight of the Iland, the Gene|rall gaue a &s;ignl to all captaines to come aboorde him, being vnder &s;aile, directing his cour&s;e to the I|land of <HI>Gomera,</HI> and the other &s;hips did their inde|uour to follow him, and anchored about the necke of the valley, lying north north ea&s;t off the towne. The &s;hips being all come to anchor, the captaines ente|red pre&s;ently into the long boates, and rowed a|boorde the Generall to know his minde: And after they had beene a while in the Generals &s;hip, they returned to their &s;hips, and 4. companies of &s;ouldi|ours were cho&s;en out, and landed in the valley. Which done, al the &s;hips waied their anchors, and &s;ailed directly toward the towne, and then came to

<P>About the &s;unne &s;etting was brought in a &s;pani&s;h pri&s;oner, which was deliuered to the Proue&s;t mar|&s;hal, by the Generals commandement, to the end he might bring them to all &s;uch places in the Ilande, whereas the Spaniardes had hidden their goods.

<P>The 14. of Iuly, in the morning the long boates rowed againe to the &s;hore, and caried aboorde &s;uch goods as the enemy had left behind them, which for the mo&s;t part were wines, for they had caried clean away all other things into the mountains, and had left almo&s;t nothing in the towne, but only the wines which they had buried in the earth: In the after|noone our people found 3. bels, which they had buri|ed in the fields, where corne had growne.</P>

<P>The 16. day in the morning the Lord Generall gaue notice to all captaines to re&s;ort to him aboord his &s;hip, becau&s;e &s;ome of the captaines had not &s;ent victuals vnto the &s;oldiors that were on land, where|by they &s;uffered hunger, and &s;undry of the &s;oldiours had complained to the General thereof: At after|noone, the enemy came to the hill which lieth ouer the towne, crying and calling vnto our men to come and fetch againe their mu&s;kets, and towards the euening many marriners with their weapons lan|ded, and at that in&s;tant al&s;o all things were ordered to march very early the next morning vp the hils to fetch againe our mu&s;kets, caliuers, and other wea|pons, which the Spaniards before had in mockery, and giving wi&s;e willed vs to fetch from them. But now when all things were ordered for this &s;eruice: the &s;ame night aro&s;e a &s;trong gale of winde, encrea|&s;ing more and more, that in the ende it grewe to a mightie tempe&s;t, that notwith&s;tanding our fleet did ride vnder the Iland <HI>Gomera</HI> in the road before the towne, &s;ome were forced to way their anchors and to put to &s;ea, to preuent the mi&s;chiefe like to happen to the &s;hips, by rea&s;on they lay &s;o neere one another. And when tho&s;e &s;hips were a little way in the Sea, they ca&s;t their anchors, and there remained. By this occa&s;ion the generals afore&s;aid enterpri&s;e was kept backe: we iudging it as a warning, that the Generall &s;hould &s;pare and pre&s;erue his people from the bloud-thir&s;ty &s;paniards, which had their holes and dens in the hils, and perhaps might haue taken away many of our liues. And heere by the way; by the name of the Iland <HI>Canaria,</HI> the Spaniards may rightly bee called <HI>Canarians</HI> or <HI>Canes,</HI> for <HI>Canaria</HI> is by interpretation, dogs kinde, for they ran as
<PB N="24" REF="14"> &s;wift as dogs, and were as tyrannicall and bloud|thir&s;ty as the rauening Wolfe, or any other wild bea&s;t, which they &s;ufficiently manife&s;ted, for as &s;oon as they could lay handes on any of our people (like vnto mad curs, agreeing with their name <HI>Canaria~s</HI>) they would pre&s;ently woary them.</P>
<P>The 17. this hurtfull night ended, and the tem|pe&s;t ouer pa&s;&s;ed, and alaid, the couragious &s;oldiors were all in readines, de&s;irous to execute this peece of &s;eruice, ex&s;pecting &amp; de&s;iring nothing more, then to march vp the hils, and to incounter their ido|latrous enemies. But vpon good con&s;ideration, this enterpri&s;e was &s;taied, and &s;ome 300. &s;oldiours &s;ent into the &s;ame valley, where 3. daies before our people had beene &s;uddainly compa&s;&s;ed, intrapped, and &s;laine by the Spaniards. Our &s;oldiours being come to the valley afore&s;aid found no re&s;i&s;tance, nei|ther could once &s;ee a &s;paniard; but found a &s;mal peece of bra&s;&s;e about a fadome long, and two barrels of gunpowder; and when our &s;ouldiours perceiued that there was no good to bee done (forbearing to mount the hils, becau&s;e they had no commi&s;&s;ion &s;o to do) with &s;uch thinges as they had they returned into the towne. The euening now approching, the Generall commanded to carry aboord the &s;hips, &s;uch goods as they had there found, and digged out of the ground, which was accordingly done and accompli|&s;hed, among which things were three bra&s;&s;e peeces, &s;ome bels and other goods.</P>
<P>Sunday the 18. of Iuly, we remained at anchor in the road of the Iland <HI>Gomera.</HI></P>
<P>Munday the 19. of Iuly, remaining yet in the I|land <HI>Gomera,</HI> and &s;eeing that the Spaniardes con|tinued in their &s;ecret holes, and dens of the moun|taines, wee &s;et fire on the towne, and as neere as we could burnt down all places, as Cloi&s;ters chur|ches,
<PB N="25" REF="14"> hermitages and hou&s;es, remaining yet in the towne vntill it was noone. After that all this was accompli&s;hed; we the vnited &s;oldiours for&s;ooke the towne, and pre&s;ently the Lord General, with al his company, went aboord the &s;hips. Thus we left the Iland <HI>Gomera</HI> burning, which was neuer before done by any nation. The Spaniardes &s;eeing that the &s;oldiours were departed out of the Iland, with all &s;peed po&s;&s;ible, in great heapes came running out of their &s;ecret caues and holes, to quench the fire, like as they of <HI>Allegona</HI> in the Iland of great <HI>Cana|ria</HI> before had done.</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day the 20. of Iuly, we lay &s;til in the road before <HI>Gomera,</HI> in this time 2. of our &s;oldiours were put into captain <HI>Cloiers</HI> &s;hip, and in lew of them, we receiued out of his &s;hip 2. others, which were hurt, with two Spaniards.</P>

<P>AFter that the Iland of great <HI>Canaria</HI> was by the vnited &s;oldiours taken, and won by force of Armes, and the Iland <HI>Gomera</HI> conquered, for &s;undry rea&s;ons they were for&s;ake~, after they had caried to their &s;hips &s;uch things as they found, fired the townes, churches, cloi&s;ters, and hou&s;es, and ra|&s;ed their Ca&s;tles.
