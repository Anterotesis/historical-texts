they doe find occasion to cauill and turne them off, and presently imploy seruants of their owne, many times very vnfitting, in regard they will not requite deserts, nor allow of any society in an apparant way of gaine: All which is indeuored towards you, for whilst you haue bin suffered to disburse your monies in the first discoue|ring, and as it were beating and laying o|pen the way, where and how this Golden Trade should rise, you haue quietly past one, but now there can be no more euasions, but that the profit plainly appeares; what complaints have bin framd? what combi|nation and plotting together?

<HEAD>The Inuitement to this golden Trade, shewing the cause of the first vnderta|<HI>king it, and orderly proceedings therein.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT hath beene the vsuall course (for the most part,) of such as trauaile Forraine parts, in the obseruiug and setting downe such things as they see, to neg|lect the noting of what is held publike, in regard that after the whole Company, be they 60. 40. or but ten together, haue taken perfect view, it stands conceited, the same is as well manifest to our whole Country, whereby diuerse times, many things worthy of note here at home, to such as take pleasure in reading of other mens aduentures, and delight in variety of other nations, are either quite left out, or slited in so poore a manner, as the Rea|der goes away vnsatisfied: I hauing receiued this caueat from that worthy gentleman, Mr. <HI>Samuel Purchus,</HI> who is so dilligent a searcher, and setter forth of all our English trauailes, of whose true in|dustry those great volumes he hath publisht to the
<PB N="2" REF="6">
world, shalbe perpetuall witnesse, spending therein (as he rightly termeth it) his talent for his Coun|tries seruice, and being likewise incouraged by him, after he had seene and read my iournall breefly rela|ting each dayes particular, in my trauailes, into this great and spacious Country: whereof by Gods grace I entend to write, laying as it were a com|mande vpon me, not to conceale that, which by publishing may first tend, vnto the aduancement of Gods glory, and next vndoubtedly the honor, wealth, and preferment of our owne nation: Like|wise hauing beene still earnestly inuited by all sorts of people, and especially by some of worthy note, (as occasions haue fallen out at any time, whereby I haue beene drawne into discourse of these tra|uailes) that I ought not, nor might not without of|fence leaue vnpublished, that which doth proffer so apparant hopes of so great a golden Trade, which at this time seemes so needfull, that by the generall complant of our great want, the earth hath shut vp her rich bowels toward vs in other places, the rather to enuite vs to seeke after that, which lies as it were vnder our noses, in respect of other trauailes, and hath beene lest as a concealed busi|nesse, vntell our time of neede, that then it might be more effectually followed, and more seriously regarded: For apparant proofes whereof, first there is no Historian but will accord, that in all ancient Histories discoursing of the inward parts of <HI>Affrica,</HI> assurely alwayes called by the name of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> it hath beene noted for the golden region, in the whole conquests of <HI>Alexinder,</HI> as <HI>Quintus Curtius</HI> sets it downe, lie onely had a great desire to
<PB REF="6">
visit these parts of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> but neuer came there. The <HI>Romans</HI> likewise, carefull Relaters of their great victories, doe speake little of the interior parts of <HI>Affrica,</HI> their greatest entrance being in the wars of <HI>Iugurth,</HI> and in pursuite of him, onely mention is made, of a great desire they had to search the South parts, in regard they were thereunto inuited, by those rich and golden armes, they found those blacke people to come against them withall, where of so many golden shields, were carried to their fa|mous City, in their so glorious triumphs, but in their discoueries they had no successe: Returning with the losse of most of their people, in regard as is alleaged, they met with diuerse drie and sandy deserts to passe, wherein as many were lost and o|uer-whelmed, so againe the parching heate, and continuall droughth was cause of the perishing of many others, and inforced their returne, without any satisfaction.</P>
<P>The selfe same causes continue still, for which we neede not search written bookes, but talke or discourse with any Marchant of this City of Lon|don, who haue yearely trade and commerse in <HI>Bar|bary,</HI> being the nearest parts of <HI>Affrica,</HI> adioyning vnto vs, and many times from our Country, into their principall Harbours, runne in twelue dayes, and in the like time againe, from them to vs, and inquire of them, whence the <HI>Moore</HI> of <HI>Barbary</HI> hath that rich gold, he makes his Chequens of, and they will tell you, there is no gold growing, within the confines of <HI>Morocco,</HI> or <HI>Fesse,</HI> at least that is knowne, or made vse of, but that the great aboundance of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The trade of the Moores in in Barbary for their gold.</NOTE> that rich gold they haue, is fetcht and brought into
<PB REF="7">
the Country, by the naturall inhabitants, for which they vndergo great trauailes, onely by land where|in they do passe great desertes of sand, with much danger, as appeares by the losse they receiue many yeares, of diuerse both of their people, and Cam|mels, yet so commodious is their trade, and fol|lowed with such great dilligence and gouernment, that amongst themselues, none are admitted but principall persons, and by especiall order, without entertaining any other nation, what respect or fa|miliarity so euer, they haue gained amongst them.</P>
<P>This in effect hath beene the sole ground, to at|taine vnto that knowledg, which I presume here to write for my Countries seruice, wherein duety es|pecially requires me, to manifest the care and dil|ligence, of those noble and worthy Gentlemen, who are the grounds, and originals of this hope|full worke, vnto whom these my labours, as their owne proper rights are dedicated, whose vertues ayming at good actions, in this our blessed and peacefull time, and cessation from those sea affaires, they were wont to be bufied in summond them vp, to in quire and make search after the goldnest hopes, and vpon good grounded conferances with such principall Merchants of <HI>Barbary</HI> as their wisdomes could make choyse of, attaine some better satisfa|ction, to their former knowledge of the Moore of <HI>Barbarios</HI> Marchandizing, as I lightly haue toucht before, wherein their practise and true vnderstand|ing in the Mathematiques assured them, the Moors vnknowne trauaile must be to the South-west, if o|ther wayes our Quotidian trade, into all and euery part of the Mediterrane sea, must needes haue had
<PB N="5" REF="7">
some or other intelligence. And theresore vniting themselues together, concluded vpon a lawfull and warrant-able course to vndergo the search of this <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings Ma|iesties Letters Patents.</NOTE> golden trade, by the South-parts, and to aduenture vppon those promising riuers, that fall into the maine Ocean, on the South-west side, wherein it now requires, I should briefly relate, the manner of their proceeding.</P>
<P>In the yeare 1618. in the month of September, they set forth a ship called the <HI>Catherine,</HI> burthen 120. tun, and in her imployd on <HI>George Thompson</HI> a man about fifty yeares of age, who had liued many years a Marchant in <HI>Barbary,</HI> the carcazon of goods hee carried with him amounted vnto 1856 f. 19 s~. 2 <ABBR>d</ABBR>. <NOTE PLACE="marg">The first voy|age.</NOTE> hauing his instructions from the Gouernour and Company to enter in the Riuer of <HI>Gambra,</HI> and with such shallops, as hee had, and were thought conuenient for him, to follow his trade, and to dis|couer vp the Riuer, leauing the shippe in a secured Harborough: All which in his part being carefully performed, in his absence, through the ouermuch trust of our English hearts, and faire familiarity wee vse to all nations, with whom we are in amity, the shippe was betrayde, and euery man left in her, his throat cut, by a few poore deiected <HI>Portingals</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The ship taken by the vagrant Portingall, and the men slaine.</NOTE> and <HI>Melatos,</HI> whom they gaue free recourse aboord, being onely banisht people, and for the most runna|gados from their Country, as when I come more particularly to write of them, will more fitly be deliuered: <HI>Thompson</HI> vpon intelligence, being got|ten farre vppe into the Riuer, and finding the in|habitants to vse him curteously, with the Kings allowance of the Country, seated himselfe vppon
<PB REF="8">
the land, and thorough the kindnesse of the inha|bitants, neere those parts where the shippe was lost, some of the English who came downe from <HI>Thompson,</HI> where safely conueighed many dayes trauaile ouer land, vntill they found meanes, to meete with shipping to transport them home, with their woefull tidings: Whereupon the noble Aduenturers, with all expedition set forth a Pin|nace of fifty tunnes, called the S. <HI>Iohn,</HI> and in her a new supply of goods, and direction to <HI>Thompson,</HI> either for his repaire, withall his Company home, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The second voyage.</NOTE> or as he did affect his trade, or had hope of his dis|couery, to make vse of those goods, and abide there: He vtterly refused to come away, and there|fore sent away the S. <HI>Iohn,</HI> who for that they came in an vnseasonable time, which then experience made them vnderstand, and thorough some other abuses, which more conueniently else where I shall set downe, which losse of many of her men re|turned, and as little comfort of gaine to the Aduenturers, onely hopefull letters from <HI>Thomp|son,</HI> inuiting them to a new supply, and by the next season to send vnto him a shippe and pin|nace, with some especiall commodity hee made mention of, confidently affirming, they should no wayes doubt of a hopefull discouery, where the Moores of <HI>Barbary</HI> traded, and a valewable returne for their losses sustained, promising in the meane time, which such company as he had left with him, being in all onely eight persons, in his small boate to search vp the Riuer, which hee attempted in a payre of Oares, takeing onely two of his owne Company with him, the rest
<PB N="7" REF="8">
people of the Country, which whom hee past vp the Riuer, and got to <HI>Tinda,</HI> a place hee aymed at; in hope to haue had conference with a blacke Merchant, called <HI>Buckor Sano,</HI> (of whom I shall haue cause to speake in the Relation of my owne trauailes) fayling of him, for that hee was then in his trauailes within the land, hee stayd not many houres aboue, how-be-it in that time, hee recei|ued such intelligence of the trade hee lookt after, that such an extasie of ioy possest him, as it is and hath beene aleadged against him, that growing more peremptory then he was wont, and seeming to gouerne with more contempt, by a quarrell fal|ling out amongst them one of his Company <NOTE PLACE="marg">Captaine <HI>Thompson</HI> slain.</NOTE> slew him, to the vtter losse of what he had attaind vnto, who in regard of emulation in striuing to keepe others hee affected not in ignorance, com|mitted nothing to paper, so as all his endeauours and labours were lost with him. These things I haue presumed to write, that it may appeare, what rubs haue beene in the infancy of this disco|uery, and may partly make answere to the question may bee propounded, by any that shalbee pleased to read ouer my insuing discourse, why so hope|full and promising abusinesse should bee neg|lected.</P>
<P>And now I returne to the worthy Aduenturers who little distrusting this mishap, not withstanding <HI>Thompson</HI> was slaine in March, whereof they could haue no intelligence: In October after beeing a conuenient season set forth againe a shippe and Pinnace, the shippe called the <HI>Syon,</HI> burthen 200. tunne, and the S. <HI>Iohn</HI> a Pinnace of 50 tunne: <NOTE PLACE="marg">The third voy|age.</NOTE>
<PB N="8" REF="9">
In this shippe it pleased them to imploy mee the present wrighter, and now what doeth insewe of this discourse; is written from mee either as an eye witnesse, or what I haue receiued from the Country people, and none but such, as were of esteeme, and as my confidence assures, would deliuer no false thing, as where I come to speake of the blacke people in particular, may be more aptly conceiued. The 25. of October 1620. wee set sayle from <HI>Dart-mouth,</HI> the 4. of Nouember, when the day appeared we were vp with the Iland of <HI>Launcerot,</HI> and the next day by noone, past the Canary Iland, and had layd all that land the 17. of Nouember, we came to an anckor in the Riuer of <HI>Gambra,</HI> hauing had some occasion of stay by the way, to the losse of neere three dayes, so as our <NOTE PLACE="marg">The whole way from England to the Riuer, runne in 20. dayes.</NOTE> whole trauaile from <HI>Dart-mouth</HI> thither was in 20. dayes, we anckored some foure leagues within the mouth of the Riuer.</P>
<P>And to auoide inconueniences, by intermingling one thing with another, to set downe each parti|cular as they presented themselues: I haue thought it most acceptable to the Reader, to diuide my dis|course into particular heads, the more aptly to bee vnderstood, wherein I thinke it fit to beginne with <NOTE PLACE="marg">The particulers handled in this booke.</NOTE> the description of the Riuer, with the limit and bounds thereof, so farre as we haue scene, likewise what opinion experience makes mee hold for the continuance thereof, and how necessary it is, to bee searcht into for aduancing the <HI>Golden Trade,</HI> with a relation what we find liuing therein, which may serue for sustenance, and maintaine the Traueller, next the seuerall sorts of people, inhabi|ting

vpon the land, <HI>Blackmen alias Mandingos,</HI> or <HI>E|thiopians, Fulbies,</HI> and the vagrant <HI>Porting all,</HI> with the manner of their liues, buildings, and fortifica|tions, the state of their Kings, and the title of other Commaunders, and their manner of life. The gouernment of the <HI>Mary-bucke</HI> or <HI>Bissareas,</HI> the dis|course of their Religion, and seperations from the rest, and course of trading, and therein speaking of their luliettos or Merchants, with the Relation of my meeting with <HI>Buckor Sano,</HI> a great blacke Merchant, and commerce with him: Their Iuddies or Fidlers, and manner of meeting, with the dis|course of circumcision, and report of their diuell Ho-re, what manner of trads are amongst the com|mon people, their order for tilling the ground, and seuerall sorts of graine, and other plants in vse a|mongst them, and therewith an ample Relation of the times and seasons of the yeare, when those great stormes of thunder and lightning, with a|boundance of raine do fal, the vnwholsomens of the ayre in those times and what naturall reasons may be all edged as well for those contagious times, as al|so to auoyde the inconueniences that haue former|ly by most of our nations beene fallen vnto: Againe what variety of wilde beasts aswell offensiue, and rauenous, as also such as are for the sustenance and comfort of those as trauaile, we find the Country replenished with, thereunto adioyning what land foule is likewise there, the aboundance of both, which kinds are alwayes at hand to mend the dyet of any ingenious looker out; and with a briefe con|clusion from myselfe, I shut vp my discourse vnto which seuerally I now proceed: &amp; first to the Riuer.</P>

<HEAD>The description of the Riuer.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Riuer, whereof I now take in hand, (by Gods grace) to write, is scituate in the lati|tude of 13 degrees and &frac12;, by all or the most part of Mappes and Cardes, and by some called, by the name of <HI>Gambia,</HI> by others <HI>Gamba,</HI> and by another sort set downe <HI>Gambra,</HI> to which latter name being most frequent, I doe apply my selfe, for by the na|turall inhabitants, either belowe in the mouth of it, neither it aboue to the farthest I haue trauelled, being vpon the truest accompt I could keepe, some 320 leagues, or 960 miles, could I euer heare any proper name, but only the word <HI>Gee,</HI> which in their language, they vse to all riuers, and waters: It hath one sole entrance, which in the very mouth, is about some 4 leagues broad, and in the channell 3 fad|dome water, at the least, without any barre, contra|ry to the setting of it formerly forth, where it is generally noted to haue a barre, and much sholer water then we haue found: After we are run some 4 leagues in, it doth spread it selfe, into so many riuers, bayes, and creekes, that for the space of some 30 leagues, vnto a Towne called <HI>Tauckro valley,</HI> it is so intricate, thar many months might be spent to search each particuler within that limit; but for that my occasion of writing, is grounded vpon the great hopes, and expectations, that are from aboue I entend not to make any stay there, but refer what is to be sayd, vntil I speake of the inhabitants, only, as I proceed to let you know, that the maine chan|nell, is not to be mistaken, except within the limit
<PB N="11" REF="10">
aforesayde, and then also thorough great neglect, or rather some wilfull ignorance.</P>
<P>Thus with a faire streame, this braue riuer shoo|teth in flowing from his mouth, into the land, neare vpon 200 leagues, vnto a Towne called <HI>Baraconda,</HI> or some little aboue, &amp; that is the vttermost bounds of his flowing, euen in the lowest season of the yeare: For as in all riuers, running into the sea, the increase of the inland waters, occasioned by raines, or snowes, doe abate of the seas in draught; so much more, in this great Riuer, who swels vpright 30 foote, obseruing one due time, and season of the yeare for euer, must the seas force in those swelling times, be mightely driuen backe; whereby a cer|taine knowledge is attaind, which are the setled times, to be followed eamestly, to meete with no impediment, in passing vp, which impediment, is onely want of water to passe ouer flats, which in the lowest season of the yeare, in certaine places, are met withall, as is commonly seene, in all ri|uers, of such mighty inlets, which bankes as it were being past, presently a faire passable Riuer continues, for many leagues; and as we expect our seasons of Winter, and Sommer, so do these inha|bitants these times of floods, occasioned by aboun dance of raine, which raines alwayes proceed forth of the South-east, and haue their beginnings, much sooner in the inland, then at the Riuers mouth, so as in those parts, where we haue had aboade, they begin to fall in the latter end of May, and at the <NOTE PLACE="marg">These are all more largly written of, where the til|lage of the ground is han|dled.</NOTE> Riuers mouth, not vntill the end of Iune: These raines continue very violent, for three moneths, comming downe with great winds, and very much
<PB N="12" REF="11">
thunder, and lightniug, not perpetually, but as we say, in suddaine gustes, and stormes, the violence whereof being ouerpassed, the people continue their labour, as where I write of their manner of Tillage, is more largely set downe, as also a more free discription of these contagious times: The increase of the Riuer likewise, in the beginning of the yeare, before any raine is seene to fall where we aboade, did make it propable, that raine wasfal|len, within the land, before we tasted any, all which affirmes the great inlet of this hopefull Riuer, and giues an assurance, that it is passable, if times and seasons be obserued, and with dilligence followed, with boates, and vessels fitted accordingly, as expe|rience in trauelling it already so farre, may some wayes warrant a sufficient director.</P>
<P>Next to shew a continuance of this great streame, when we had rowed beyond the ebbing and flow|ing, and 12. dayes against the currant, which wee trauailed in the moneth of Ianuary, when the water was at the lowest of his nourishment, and then the shole we met withall, and stopped our further pro|ceeding, had 9. inches water, which shallownesse continued not aboue to yards, wherein if we had <NOTE PLACE="marg">We were 10 of our owne com|pany, that went vp in a shallop, and 4 Blacke that I hired to carry vp a Canoe.</NOTE> beene an able company together, being onely 10. of vs, and likewise had had prouision of tooles wherewithall, and beene assured of a commodius trade, and so friendly a people to conuerse withall, as after we found, any encouragement would haue made vs worke a gut thorough that little distance, and being past that place, the riuer shewed him|selfe againe, with faire promising, so farre as wee bad occasion to looke, neare a league, and how far
<PB N="13" REF="11">
he might so continue, we are ignorant, and in those places aboue did we see sea-horses, whosenature re|quires deep waters, as where I write at large of him, you may better perceiue, likewise the higher still, more store of Crocodiles, which addes incourage|ment of the largnesse of the Riuer; and likewise a faire breadth betweene the shores: I follow these probabilities, to encourage the farther search of the Riuer, which dilligently followed, may euen in one season, giue a full satisfaction to the forward Aduenturer, and if it so fall out, we can meete with any towne aboue, standing by the Riuer side, it will assuredly proue a commodious place, to make our aboade in, to take the aduantage of the seasonable times, and to make returnes, to, and againe, as ex|perience must leade, to the greatest aduantage. And for trade there is no question, but a maruai|lous recourse would be vnto vs, which is already testified, in that so many hundreds of them came downe vnto vs, to the remote place where we were enforced to stay, building them houses of reads on both sides the shore, and the recourse still more, and more increasing, in so much as we had intelli|gence, the people were comming, from a great Towne called <HI>Iaye</HI> in their language, and wee doe conceaue it to be <HI>Gago,</HI> if wee had beene furnisht with commodities enough for them, and likewise knowne the seasonable times for our passage in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">These <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> Riuer, and conuenient Harborough for our safer aboade; and why may not the towne they call <HI>Mumbar,</HI> which they say is but 6. dayes iourney from the place we stayed at, according to their tra+uaile, which in the discourse of the people Laster

lay downe, belikewise vpon the Riuer, if so, how great an aduantage, might it bring vnto vs, if wee were minded to stay there, when the Moore of <HI>Bar|bary</HI> come, for at this towne the Carauan from <HI>Bar|bary</HI> doth stay and abide, we know their whole trade is for gold, but what quantity they haue here, or what people it is, they trade withall, we are as yet ignorant, and this aduenture vp the riuer, would vndoubtedly discouer, that the gold is there, wee are assured of, hauing battered, and had trade for some, and vpon triall the same in goodnesse, that <HI>Barbary</HI> affords our Countries, hauing the riuer to friend, we should be able, though but few of vs, to defend our selues, from the rage of the <HI>Barbary</HI> Moore, if he should attempt any thing against vs, for vndoubtedly, when he shall see vs entered into his trade, he will appose what may be, to affront vs; And although I haue beene promised safe de|fence, by the country people, yet a boat is a certaine retreate, and the Riuer a constant friend, to trust vnto.</P>

<P>This is the poore <HI>Fulbies</HI> life, whereunto he is so enured, that in a manner he is become bestiall, for I haue noted diuerse times, when we haue come vp in the morning, before his Cattle had beene dis|perst, or gone to seede, when we haue called for the Mr, or chiefe of them, to make a bargaine for a beefe, or beeues, as we had occasion, hee would come vnto vs, from forth the middle of the heard, and those parts of him which were bare, as his face and hands, but especially his face, would stand so thicke of flyes, as they vse to sit in the hot Sum|mer time vpon our horses, and teemes here in Eng|land, and they were the same manner of flye wee haue, which the <HI>Fulbie</HI> would let alone, not offring to put vp his hand, to driue them away, therein see|ming more senslesse, then our Country beasts, who will wiske with their tayles, and seeke any other de|fence, to auoyde or be rid of them, but for our owne parts we were faine, during our parley with them, to ho'd a greene bow, to beate of the flie, fin|ding his stay neuer so little, very offensiue.

The language the <HI>Fulbie</HI> speakes, is different from the black-men, the women are our chiefest customers, for in most places, within the ebbing and flowing, where we did lie for Trade, we should be sure to haue their custome euery day, which was to bring vs new milke, sowre milke, and curdes, and two sorts of butter, the one new and white, the o|ther hard and of an excellent colour, which we cal|led refined butter, and is without question, but for a little freshnes, as good as any we haue at home: all which they brought vnto vs, in great and small gourds like dishes, made vp very handsomely, and one thing let me not forget to giue them due praise in, that in what someuer you receiued from them, you should haue it so neate and cleane that in your milke you shold not perceiue a mote, nor in her but|ter any vncleanlines nay the gourds, ordishes, they <NOTE PLACE="marg">The cleane|lines of the Fulby women.</NOTE> brought it in, on the very outsides would shine with cleanlinesse, and one the inward parts, without any nastinesse, and if at any time, by any mischance, there had beene a mote, or haire, which you had shewed vnto her, she would haue seemed to blush, in defence of her cleanely meaning.</P>

part, is either Rice, or some other graine, boyled, which being brought vnto them by the women in goardes, hot, putting in their hands, they rowle vp into balles, and cast into their mouthes, and this is their manner of feeding: they doe seldome eate either flesh or fish, the rather because they cannot get it, then out of any will to refuse it: and although they are great breeders of such very poultry, as ate our Cockes and Hennes, and haue vnderstanding to cut Capons, yet they are great sparers thereof, and preserue them to sell vnto vs, for small peeces of Iron, beades, and such like commodities, wher|of if we be furnished, we can want none of that pro|uision.</P>
<P>They will say, their feeding so seldome, is a great preseruation of their healths, &amp; at that time, when the Sunne is downe, a fittest time for nourishment, auoyding especially, to eate in the heate of the day, as a thing wonderfull unwholesome, wherein it may please you to giue me leaue to vtter my o|pinion, which happly comming to be scanned by <NOTE PLACE="marg">A digression, by the Writer, for the better preseruing of mens liues and healths.</NOTE> men of knowledge, may produce some rules of bet|ter order, then hath hither-unto beene kept amon|gest our Nation, which hath caused the losse of so many liues, and the dangerous sickenesse of o|thers, therewithall laying a generall scandall vpon the countrey it selfe, to be both infectious, and vn|wholesome for our bodies, whereas indeede it is our owne disorders: For the custome that hath beene hither-unto held, especially into this Riuer, hath beene without any diligence, to make choise of such Sea-men for gouernours, as were men of temperance, and commaund, who being able to

temper well themselues, might the better gouerne the rest, whose ill carriages may be thought to bee great prouokers for shortning other mens dayes: I will example it in this last voyage of ours. The Maister was a man knowne, for an excellent Arts|man, but in the gouernement of himselfe, so farre from knowledge, that after our passage from <HI>Dart|mouth,</HI> which was in October, vntill the middle of March after, about which time he dyed, it will be iustified, he was neuer twenty dayes sober, in which time he went not alone, but our Chirurgion, with sundry other officers that were of his societie, with their liues payed for their riotous order. And fur|ther, whereas wee were diuided into two shallops, to goe vp the Riuer, the bigger whereof, the prin|cipall Factor was to follow his trade in, and carri|ed therefore in the same a Butte of Sacke, and a Hogges-head of <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> making choice of such men as were the most able, and likeliest bodies to hold out, and he in himselfe carefull enough, as his experience might well aduise him, hauing spent many yeares, and made many voyages vpon that continent, to obserue both his diet of eating and drinking; yet towards his people, hee carried at sometimes, such an ouer-sparing hand, that they fell to practising how they might deceiue him, ma|king vse of all aduantages, to steale those hot drinkes from him, which being purchased, as it were from his niggardly nature, they would diuide as a spoyle with great greedinesse amongest them|selues, and thereby wrought their owne confusions, that of those people he carried with him, they ey|ther died before hee came backe to the shippe, or

<P>Now for my opinion concerning our diet, I hold well with the Blacks, that to feed at noone, is an vn|holesome thing, for that the Sunne, being then in his extremitie of heate, and by his neerenes hauing such power ouer vs, the moisture that lies within the body, is exhaled to the exterior parts, to com|fort, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Writers o|pinion concer|ning dyet.</NOTE> and refresh that, which the heate doth drie, and then are the interior parts most cold, and vn|apt for nutriment, wherein experience makes vs see, that in the height and heate of the day we can with great facilitie, and without offence, drinke off such a draught, or quantitie of <HI>Aqua vitae,</HI> or hot waters, as if we should drinke heere in our natiue countrey at one time, would certainely burne out our harts;

This commoditie the people doe carry like|vvise farre vp into the Country, for amongst them|selues, we can perceiue they make little vse thereof, so as their trauell is long and tedious: the returne they make, is not discernd to be any thing but gold, and a kinde of Nuts they call <HI>Cola,</HI> which is in great esteeme amongst them, thevertue whereof I shall hereafter tell you: and for that it may be here de|manded, what becoms of the gold by them brought dovvne, I will shevv you vvhat by report is told vs; These Mary-buckes doe hold an opinion, that af|ter their death they shall appeare in another world,

Another sort I must needes remember, whose great abundance may well put me in minde, besides their society and neighbour|hood, which in our trauell vp the Riuer we were of|ten acquainted withall, which are, the Babownes and Munkeys, whereof the countrey hath innume|rable <NOTE PLACE="marg">Munkies.</NOTE> store, and where they are, they doe goe in heards, and companies, but are of two societies: the Munkeys alwaies keepe by themselues, and great and little as they are; onely of that kind consort to|gether, and euen in Ilands that lye within the Riuer, they are as frequent as on the mayne, which con|demnes the report is of them, that they cannot swimme, but being in the water will drowne pre|sently, and in my owne knowledge I can affirme, that hauing bought a Monkey from the countrey people, who vse to bring them vnto vs, and sel them for poore things; being got loose in my boate that

<P>But to speake of the Babowne, I must say, it is a won|derfull thing, to obserue a kind of common-wealth that is amongst them; they haue none but their owne kind together, and are in heardes, of three or foure thousand in a company; as they trauell, they goe in rancke, whereof the leaders are certaine of the greater sort, and there is as great, and large of them, as a Ly|on, the smaller following, and euer now and then as a Commaunder a great one walkes; the females carry their yong vnder their bellies, except shee haue two, and then one vnder, the other aboue. In the rear comes vp a great company of the biggest sort, as a guard, a|gainst any persuing enemy, and in this manner doe they march along: they are very bold, and as we passe in the riuer, when we come neare their troupes, they will get vp into the trees, and stand in gaze vpon vs, and in a kind of collericke humour the great ones will shake the trees, and with his hands clatter the boughes in that fashion, as it doth exceed the strength of a man, to doe the like, barking, and making a noyse at vs, as if they were much offended, and in this manner, ma|ny times they will follow vs along, and in the night time, where wee ride at an ancker take vp their stands, or lodgings on the mountaine toppes, or on the trees that are aboue vs, whereas we heare their gouernment: <NOTE PLACE="marg">A gouerment amongsts them</NOTE> for many times in the night you shall heare such a noyse of many of their voyces together, when instant|ly one great voyce exalts it selfe, and presently all are

hush, and the noyse is dasht, so as we were wont to say, Maister Constable speakes; likewise when wee are a shore and meete with these troupes, on a sudden the great ones will come forward, and seeme to grin in our faces; but offer vp a gunne, and away they packe. One of our people one day as we came neare the shore in our boate, and a troupe of these shauers, being ga|zing on vs, made a shot and kild one of them, which before the bote could get on shore, the others had taken vp betwixt them and carried quite away, but we haue kild of them, which the countrey people doe much desire, and will eate very heartely; wherein I hope neuer to take their part: And lastly let mee tell <NOTE PLACE="marg">The people of the Country eate them.</NOTE> you that wee haue seene in the desert places they vse, trees and plants, wound and made vp together in that artificiall manner, and wrought together with that thicknes ouer head, to keepe away the sun, and shade the ground, which hath bin beaten, &amp; smoothed vnder neath, and all things in the manner and shape of an excellent arbour, which place they haue only vsed, and kept for their dancing and recreation; that no man liuing that should haue come by chance, and seene the same, without knowledge of these vnluc|ky things, but would haue confidently supposed, it had, and must haue beene the handy worke of man; which some wayes confirmes the opinion the Spa|niard <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spaniards opinion of them.</NOTE> holds of them, and doth not sticke to write it, that they are absolutely a race and kind of peo|ple, who in regard they will not bee brought to worke, and liue vnder subiection, refuse to speake, and so he reports of them.</P>
<P>And to conclude, amongst their multitude of wilde beasts, we haue enquired amongst them: es|pecially,
<PB N="154" REF="79">
when I was at the highest in the countrey, whether they could tell or report of a Vnycorne, setting foorth vnto them a beast, with one onely horne in his forehead, and certainely they haue told me, that higher within the land there is a beast, which hath one onely horne in the same manner, but describe the beast, to be both about the colour and bignesse of a vallow Deare, and the horne to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The pleoples report of a Vnicorne.</NOTE> be about the length of their arme, and no other|wise, which is nothing like to the description of a Vnicorne, as he is with vs set out, if there bee any such beast; whereof indeed I am very doubtfull, and so I am come to the last, which is to deliuer, what land fowle, and of that nature, there doe remaine wilde as we haue seene amongst them.</P>

<HEAD>The discourse of land fowle.</HEAD>
<P>AMongst such fowle and birds that remaine and liue vpon the land, in our trauels vp the Riuer, and our daily walkes and trauels vpon the shore; our indraught being so many hundred miles, wee neuer saw any Estriches, neither did any of the cun|trey people, euer bring any of their feathers to bar|ter, or sell vnto vs, so as it appeares plainly there is none of them in these parts; notwithstanding in the Riuer of Senega, which is to the Northward, and likewise againe more Southerly, vpon the Sea coast of <HI>Affrica</HI> great store: Therefore the greatest bird or fowle we see, is called a Stalker; who by rea|son of his long legs and necke, when he stands vp|right, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Stalker.</NOTE> is in height taller then a man, his body in sub|stance is more then an indifferent lambe which wee
<PB N="155" REF="79">
doe feede vpon, and finde it somewhat a dry meate, but well allowed for nourishment, and by the countrey people much esteemed of: The especiall desire we haue to kill them, is in regard of some feathers he hath, which being taken in due time, and so preserued, are heere at home esteemed and worne.</P>
<P>The next in greatnesse, is called a Wake, in re|gard of the great noyse hee makes when hee flyeth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The wake.</NOTE> which resembleth what he is called by, and of these there is great abundance, who for the most part liue vpon their Rice grounds, and in those times do them great spoyles: they are very good to eate, and is a bird of a great stature, hauing the vpper part of his head carrying a beautifull shew, with a pleasing tuft on his Crowne, which I haue seene worne by great personages here at home.</P>
<P>There is infinite store of another sort of excellent birds which wee call Ginney Hennes, in bignesse <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ginney hens.</NOTE> much about our Phesants, and in beauty answerable; his feathers being all laid ouer him like vnto eyes, in a pleasing fashion, they are all the countrey ouer, and in flockes of many hundreds together; their food is vpon their corne grounds, keeping close to|gether, insomuch as we haue killed eight of them at one shoote, they are an excellent meate, and many of these are brought into England, and giuen as pre|sents to those of note, and worthy persons who pre|serue and keepe them for their rarenesse, as birds of pleasure: And in the very like abundance they haue Patridges, whose colour is not beautifull, so much as our Patridges here; but onely of a darke feather, and these are likewise all the countrey ouer, where it
<PB N="156" REF="80">
is planted, for the most remaining neare their hou|ses, and in the middle of their dwellings, the great <NOTE PLACE="marg">Patridges.</NOTE> plenty of both which kinds, of Gynney Hennes and Patridges, are some manifest tokens there are no Foxes at all in the countrey, who are in these our parts great enemies to both the kindes of Phesant and Patridge: and the cause the keepe so neare the houses, is to preserue them from as subtill enemies, which are the Babownes, and Munkeys, who are no night walkers, and in the day time the recourse of people makes them keepe further off, whereas o|therwayes they would not faile to be sharers. There are also great store of Quailes, who are in bignesse <NOTE PLACE="marg">Quailes.</NOTE> as great as a Woodcocke, and from whence it is deriued I cannot auouch, onely it is saide, they are of those kind of Quailes as fell among the children of <HI>Israels</HI> tents: thus much I can affirme, they are a pleasing and delightful meate, and in many places, where we haue made abode, they haue accustomed to sall about vs: so as prouided wherewithall to shoote them, mens dyets are mended, euen in a short warning: In all their townes and dwellings likewise store of Pidgeons, vvhich feede vpon the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Pigeons.</NOTE> offall of their Corne, in the very doores, yet all are wilde, and of tame Pidgeons they haue no knowledge: I haue vvith my stone-bow or pellet|bow in two houres killed twenty Pidegeons, euen among their houses, vvhich manner of shooting they haue had in vvonderfull admiration: And these birds or fowle nominated, are such that are at all times, and in most places euer neare at hand, and alvvayes ready for sustenance if men bee proui|ded, and vvill take small paine to looke them.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="80">There are likewise in the countrey Parats, but none good for ought, except the dun Parat with the red tayle, of which fort you haue some few that come to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Parrats.</NOTE> speake well: but of Paraquetos there are very many, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Paraquetos.</NOTE> and beautifull birds, which are often brought home, and some few attaine to perfection. Also of smaller birds great varietie &amp; sundry strange shapes, amongst <NOTE PLACE="marg">Variety of smal birds.</NOTE> which many are in colours, delightfull to the eye, and many in notes very pleasing to the eare: there is a|mongst the variety one smal bird, which for his strang|nesse we obserue, hee hath no legges, but two strings like the bird of <HI>Arabia,</HI> with which he hangs with his head downeward, and hath such resemblance to a dead leafe, as it hangs on the tree, being direct of that <NOTE PLACE="marg">A small bird withoutlegges.</NOTE> colour, whereby vnlesse hee be seene too light, you can hardly discouer him, and he doth seeme to take pleasure to deceiue mens eye-sight, hanging wonde|rous steddy, without motion, whilest hee is lookt af|ter, and very neare the touching: Likewise another <NOTE PLACE="marg">A bird with foure wings, about the big|nes of a turtle Doue.</NOTE> strange bird there is, which flyeth with foure wings we see him not all the day, but an houre before night, his two foremost wings are largest, the other are a pretty distance backward, and beares his body be|tweene foure palpably.</P>
<P>As I speake of these birds, it is very necessary I should set downe how nature teacheth these little creatures to prouide for the safety of themselues, and the young they bring forth, I haue shewed before, vvhat troupes and multitudes of Babownes and Mon|keys the countrey is stored withall, vvhich are pro|fest enemies to feathered fowle, and therefore in these little poore creatures, who can make no resi|stance, Nature hath directed them by Art to preuent

cruelty: Amonst the great variety of strange trees, and woods, which the countrey affordeth, whereof there is not any, that I can know, or call by an Eng|lish <NOTE PLACE="marg">How the birds preserue their young, from the Babouns, and Munkyes.</NOTE> name, by saying, this tree doth grow in England: there is especially one, who doth exceed in prickles, both vpon the body, branches, and armes: euen to the outermost small springges, many of these grow di|stant from the water, and many of them grow vpon the banke side, hanging their toppes ouer the water: we obserue, that of this onely tree, the litle Bird makes choyse, and not content with his defence of prickles, makes vse likewise of his growing ouer the water, and on that side which bends to the riuer on the very out|side doe they winde their nestes with an owse, or neck, which is hollow, made of reeds and sedge, the whole neast hanging like a bottle, made fast by the necke, in some places so thicke together, that the same side of the tree, seemes as it were all couered with thatch; vn|to which, if notwithstanding the prickles, the Babown or Munkey durst approach, the feare hee shall haue, that the boughes will not beare him, and the fall hee is in daunger of, together vvith the fright of the wa|ter vnderneath him, is able to daunt him, by vvhich natural care he preserues his increase, and speedes bet|ter then many times the Parrat doth, for he likewise is prouident to make his neast on the outermost smallest twigge of a tree; but on the land winding it about the twigge, so neare, as it will not beare any of his vn|happy enemies, who notwithstanding are vigilant for their owne ends, and by getting vpon vpper boughes, will ouerlooke his desired prey, and when hee sees they are growne to fill vp the neast, will hazard chari|ly as the bough may beare him, and sitting fast with

Another kind of art, nature hath taught these birds in the high banke which is steepest ouer the Riuer, whose steepenesse hinders the accesse of these deuourers, they will make holes so artificially round like augor holes, and of that equall distance the one by the other, so thicke <NOTE PLACE="marg">Another meanes of pre|seruation.</NOTE> as the banke will beare, carrying them at least a yard within the ground, by which places they preserue themselues and their young.</P>
<P>But there are birds of defence such as are hawkes, whereof there is one sort, as large as our Ierfauchon, and these as the people tell vs, will of their owne ac|cords, kill the wild deare by ceazing vpon his head, and hanging fast, doth continue beating with his <NOTE PLACE="marg">Hawkes that will kill a Val|low deare.</NOTE> wings, vntill the deare faintes, and then he preyes vp|on him. And likewise of other sorts that liue vpon prey, whose manner of breeding, is in the open trees, and by the continuall watching and attending the nest, they are ready to defend and saue their young. There are no great Eagles but of a kind of small ba|stard Eagles infinite store, and likewise seuerall sorts <NOTE PLACE="marg">Bastard Eagles.</NOTE> of rauening Kites and Buzzards, whereof the skin of one sort smells wondrous sweet and strong, after the savour of the Crocodile: These sorts are easily to bee discerned: for if at any time, wee hapned to kill a beast in the woods, whereby any blood were discoue|red, although there were scarce any one of these raue|ning birds to be seene, almost instantly, you should haue such troupes of all sorts come in, as were able to deuoure the whole carkas, if wee were not present to

<HEAD>The Conclusion.</HEAD>
<P>And for a finall end doe earnestly desire, that what
<PB N="161" REF="83">
is written may be taken into consideration, thereby to stirre vp a more willing affection to prosecute and goe on in a timely proceeding vpon this hopefull trade, which will craue expedition in regard of these reasons following: First there is, as it were, a certaine combination made betwixt the people aboue and vs, neuer to faile them of a yearely trade, which they in their parts, (without all doubt) will caresully expect, and as they haue faithfully promised, will accordingly prouide for, and if in our parts, it should be neglected, may iustly cause them to take a great distrust of our fidelities, which in regard, we are now the first white people they haue seene, and haue from them receiued such faire approbation, may settle a distast for the present very preiudiciall, and among such a barbarous people, wee know not whether it may be easily remooued. Againe the course we run, is allowable by our Lawes, fitting and agreeing with the peacefull time we liue in, opposite to no neigh|bourly loue or amity, neither confronting any for|raine Prince, by entring, or intermedling within any forbidden territories, neither is it done in any war|like, or hostile manner, but by the auncient and free Commerse, that vniteth nations, the course of mar|chandizing, a commodious exchange answering to either side, wherein an especiall animation is, the cer|taine knowledge we haue gained in discouering the golden trade of the Moores in Barbary, which was the first incourager and beginning of this businesse, and for which the Aduentures hitherto haue beene laide, through the vncertainety whereof, those losses and mischances that haue hapned, fell out, and there|fore now should with a more setled resolution be fol|lowed
<PB N="162" REF="84">
to regaine, by knowledge, what ignorance miscarryed in. And I may ioyne with this, the fami|liar conuersation, faire acceptance, and mutuall ami|tie, we finde the natiues to embrace vs withall, not onely celaring our owne doubts, which before know|ledge must of necessity be, but likewise disproouing, and altogether confounding the report and speeches of all those, who, to serue their owne ends, gaue out, the people aboue to bee a bloody and dangerous nation.</P>
<P>Againe to aduance the Aduenturer, let the alrea|dy knowne and certaine trade be remembred, which in my owne perfect knowledge I will make good, (against all Maligners, and secret opposers) that in our staple and principall commodities, it is not vented, but at tenne for one profite; and admitte the disco|uery should not prooue; yet there will be found places of trade sufficient, and that within the limit of faire recourse, to vent and put of such a reasona|ble proportion as shall bring a returne of that ad|uantage, as shall be able to beare the charge of a further search, and likewise answer the expectation here at home of any reasonable minded aduenturer, prouided they doe arme themselues by knowledge, of what those things are which are vendible, and likewise how to attaine vnto those places, and or|der their occasions, where those returnes are to be made; whereunto is added that the expectation is not long, in respect of other voyages, when as the returne is such, that within the compasse of tenne moneths, the whole voyage is to be perfor|med, both out and home, allowing the ship to bee set foorth from <HI>London,</HI> and to to make their her re|turne againe.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="84">Moreouer by the last discouery, so many hundred miles vp the Riuer, all which way is perfectly known, and from part to part obserued, and euery reach in order by me set downe, and carefully kept, which may not onely cleare any doubts and difficulties in that already knowne way, but likewise enable the iudgement for passing further, and especially order and giue directions, what boates or vessels are most apt and proper to follow the discouery withall, as well fot speedier passage, as also for the most aduan|tage, to a more profitable returne.</P>
<P>And further we may take into consideration, how the times and seasons of the yeare, are vnto vs disco|uered, that the turbulent and infectious seasons may bee prouided for, and men aduised the better to beare them, and prouide for themselues, whereby (as it shall please God to giue a blessing) those incon|ueniences may bee auoyded, which formerly haue beene fallen into, and things more necessary carryed along, which through ignorance heeretofore haue beene neglected, together with diuerse o|ther abuses, that by experience, no doubt, may be a|mended.</P>
<P>And lastly, in taking leaue of you the noble gen|tlemen Aduenturers in this hopefull Discouerie, let mee (vnder correction) say vnto you, Be not dis|couraged, let not the iangling dispositions of any, whom your owne wisedomes leades you to see aime onely to make vp their owne ends, dis hear|ten you. And if it please you examine the conditi|on of what is past, which, if I mistake not, may bee this set downe. The first aduenture was lost, and mis|carried through want of Care and Iudgement of
<PB N="164" REF="85">
those Sea-men and Merchants who had the mana|ging, by ouer-much trust of supposed friends, who should at the very best haue beene no otherwise thought and conceited of, then suspicious enimies, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The vagrant Portingall.</NOTE> who haue novv discouered themselues, which will euer stand for a warning to auoyde the like, and trusting them any further: And that is all you haue for that mony.</P>
<P>The second may some-wayes be laid vppon the Sea-men, whose vnderstanding should haue auoy|ded vnseasonable times, and especially Discretion should haue led them to haue shunned watering in the very height of vnseasonablenesse; but it may be excused for want of experience, insomuch as there had neuer beene any triall made, so high in the Riuer before to any effect, to discouer the vn|holsomnesse, with the operation thereof, whereby so many of them lost their liues, and brought again another losse vpon you, wherein the power of God was manifested, by whose onely hand they fell, and those few that returned, were sent to testifie, what they had felt and fallen into, whereby you haue gained a perpetuall knowledge, for obscruing sea|sonable times, for your better proceeding heereaf|ter, the valuation whereof being truly vnderstood, may aduance the imployment, which onely remai|neth in that losse, to make you satisfaction.</P>
<P>And for this third and last, wherein mine eyes haue beene a witnesse, how accounts are brought in, and perfected with you, I am ignorant, but I presume, as bad as it was, what with the returne that was made, and the remaynes brought home, of the <HI>Cargazon</HI> that was sent, you cannot (being
<PB N="165" REF="85">
iustly dealt withall) receiue any losse; but for gaine, it was neuer intended towards you, the whole busi|nesse being carried by those you gaue credit, and countenance vnto, with an absolute hand, to abate and discourage your desires, for wading further vppon these Aduentures, as by the manner thereof appeareth, which I haue already particularly ac|quainted you withall, and vnnecessary to be remem|bred heere; Onely this remaines, to make good, what I in carefull duety desired to lay open vnto you, from whence that first intent, of giuing that blow of discouragement vnto you, did arise: you haue beene since subiect to diuers other incounters, and all occasions are still earnestly pursued, to im|brace that oportunitie, that will giue leaue or way to strike you; And whereas they seeke to discou|rage you, yet by all publique and secret meanes can be deuised, they both haue and doe still addresse themselues, to proceed and goe on in the same ad|uenture, as you both know, and haue had iust cause to except against. And apparent it is, that not|withstanding you in your generous dispositions haue sate downe by the losse, yet there is that haue gained. But allovv (if it please you) all had beene lost, if you shall againe consider, vvhat charges and expences haue beene layd foorth, and disbursed in Discoueries of this nature, nay in those of farre lesse expectation; vvith the recoueries and satisfaction, that aftervvards they haue made, euen to this our natiue Countrey, vvhereof I forbeare examples, in regard they are not hidden from your true and in|genious knowledge: Only in regard of some great resemblance, that may be to this intended business,

I may commend to your considerations, the voiage into <HI>Muscouie,</HI> wherein the Marchants haue that long passage of so many hundred leagues vp a Ri|uer; and by a customary trade, is brought to bee held as an ordinary passage, the Countrey, being fitted accordingly, by which vse, it is now no other wayes vnto them, then (as wee may terme it heere) our Westerne passages vp the Riuer of <HI>Thames;</HI> wherein were more probability for the attaining of this we ayme at, in regard our Riuer is at all times open, and not subiect to cold, nor those extreame frosts, which to the <HI>Muscouy</HI> trade, are so great hin|derers: So that if you would conclude amongest your selues, of a sufficient stocke, and be armed with a bancke, the ground of merchandizing, to follow resolutely your vndertaken enterprize, For so much as to mee belongeth, I dare affirme, you are vpon the most promisingst occasion, that euer in our little Iland was vndertaken, most especiall considering by how smal a charge it may be perfect|ed wherin as experience hath made me the Writer, to a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter">quaint you with each particular, So likewise I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="2 letters">fe<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="1 letter"> my selfe vp, both with my life and fortunes, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="under-inked" EXTENT="2 letters"> with my vt+ermost indeuours, in your be|halfes, (by Gods especiall blessing) to bring to perfection, what I haue heere related, which is left with my selfe, to your worthy con|siderations.</P>
