It was di|uided in two parts by the &s;ame God, the part &s;eene, and the part vn&s;eene: But by faith &s;earch the Scriptures, there is the part and v&s;e in this our Chri&s;tian Nauigation di&s;couered.</P>
<P>The part &s;eene is well defined to bee a Booke, In which wee may &s;ee and learns to prai&s;e God in his workes. And is &s;aid to bee of two parts, Cele&s;tiall, and Elementall: In the Cele&s;tiall part may be con&s;idered the Arts, as Mu&s;icke, the harmony of the Spheres: of Soule and Body, for who&s;e health Phi&s;icke is next, in which we con&s;ider that Miraculous Medicine of pre&s;eruing life, be it Philo|&s;opher &s;tone, Salt, Virgin-earth, or other denomination, or Mathe|maticall, as the knowledge of Points, Lines, Circles, Signes, Con|&s;telations, Planets, and their Influence and power ouer bodies Ele|mentall.</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid and that by good rea&s;on, I &s;hould begin at the Centor of the Earth, &amp; &s;o con&s;ider of the things contained there|in,
<PB N="2" REF="5"> with the Sea, The face of the Earth and Sea, and the things thereon; The Aire couering the other two, and the Fire inclo&s;ing them all, making one round body of the&s;e Elementall parts, being as a Centor to the re&s;t, and &s;o p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters">e vpwards vnto the fir&s;t m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="3 letters">er, &s;hewing the relation and agreement they haue together, I liuing now nearer the Centor of the Earth (as it is ob&s;erued) by many thou&s;and miles. But if I end my worke &s;o high may bee proud (as &s;ome are) or dazelled in the Cele&s;tiall brightne&s;&s;e, being mor|tall, be ca&s;t downe with <HI>Pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="4 letters">.</HI></P>
<P>In the name of God therefore, and in his feare, I will begin with the fir&s;t mouer, which going with great violence, turneth the whole frame of the heauen within it, round in 24. houres, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t: Which heauen is &s;aid to haue no impre&s;&s;ion in it, being almo&s;t invi&s;ible, yet carrying the light and darkne&s;&s;e, making differ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">nce of time in daies and nights, according to the difference of Longitude and Latitude of places on Earth.</P>
<P>In it are all the circles and points in the whole fabricke of the world &s;aid to be de&s;cribed, their plaines defending and meeting in the Centor of the Earth, or on their other Centors.</P>
<P>The two principall points, are the two poles of the world, the North pole eliuated with vs heere at <HI>London</HI> 51. degrees, 30. or there about; and the South pole is right oppo&s;ite to it. There|fore depre&s;&s;ed iu&s;t as much (vnder the horizon of which I will &s;peake anon.) The&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 word"> points are fixed fa&s;t and vnmoueable, betweene which and through the Centor of the Earth, there pa&s;|&s;eth&punc; right line, which is called the Axe-tree of the world on which it turneth.</P>
<P>Now we mu&s;t con&s;ider both this right line, and all other right lines, cords, &s;ignes, great circles and paralels, to be diuided into 360. degrees, each degree &s;ubdiuided into 60. minutes, each minute into 60. Seconds, each Second in 60. thirds, &amp;c. as the ca&s;e may re|quire.</P>
<P>The Herman is a great circle, who&s;e Centor is in the midde&s;t of the Earth, and his plaine reacheth not onely to the face of the Earth, diuiding the vpper part from the lower, the day from the nights <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ut through the Or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the planits and fixed &s;tarres, euen to the fir&s;t mouer.

In this Circle we count the Amplitude of the Sunne or Starres; and the Point of the Compa&s;&s;e or Wind. All the Circles called Azimuthes, cro&s;&s;e the Horizon at Rectangles and pa&s;&s;e through the Poles thereof: His Parallels are Circle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Altitude, in which are ob&s;erued the po&s;ition of the Planets and fixed Starres aboue the Earth, at all howres of the day or night: Or Circles of Depre&s;ion diuiding the length of twilight.</P>
<P>The Equator is a great Circle, deuiding the World into two equall parts, the North part and the South: His parallels &s;ets out the Latitude of places on Earth, and declination in the Heauens. All the Meridians doe cro&s;&s;e the Equator at Rectangles and go through the Poles of the World. On this is counted the Lon|gitude of places on the Earth or Sea: For euerie 4 of equall time made by the equall motion of the Equator doth make 1 degree.

<P>The next thing that will trouble the young beginner, is the propo&s;itions in the&s;e 8 and 9 chapters, which are mo&s;t ea&s;ily performed, becau&s;e the demon&s;tration is &s;o plaine.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t therfore as in all plain triangles, the &s;ides are in propor|tion one to another, as the &s;ubtences of the angles oppo&s;ite, or as the &s;ines of the angles oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e &s;ides. Example in the in&s;cribed triangle: <HI>A</HI> the angle at <HI>b</HI> is in proportion to the &s;ide <HI>c d</HI> or arke <HI>c g d,</HI> as the angle <HI>c</HI> to the &s;ide <HI>b d,</HI> or arke <HI>b d e,</HI> and &s;o is the angle <HI>d</HI> to the &s;ide <HI>b c,</HI> or arke <HI>b f c.</HI></P>
<P>So note that in all rectangled right-lined triangles, the two containing &s;ides of the rectangle &s;tand perpendicular one up|on the end of another: Therefore if you put the lea&s;t &s;ide for radius or totall &s;ine, as in the figure <HI>b,</HI> the other &s;ide will be the tangent, and the &s;ubtending &s;ide of the rectangle will be the &s;ecant; or if you put the greater &s;ide for radius, the lea&s;t will be the tangent, and the &s;ubtence the &s;ecant, or you may put the &s;ubtence for radius, as in the figure <HI>c</HI> is done.</P>
<P>It is manife&s;t then that any &s;ide may be put for the totall &s;ine: Fir&s;t, if you put the &s;ubtending &s;ide for radius, as in the figure <HI>d,</HI> let <HI>a b</HI> be part of a meridian, and <HI>a c</HI> part of a paralell; then is the angle at <HI>b</HI> the cour&s;e from the meridian, and the angle at <HI>c</HI> is the cour&s;e from paralell.</P>
<P>Then if the difference of latitude <HI>a b,</HI> and cour&s;e, that is the angle at <HI>b</HI> or <HI>c</HI> be given, you may finde the leagues runne, or di&s;tance <HI>b c,</HI> as in the fir&s;t re&s;olution Arithmeticall.</P>

<P>But if you demaund the difference of longitude, the latitude and cour&s;e being given, you may doe it by the fir&s;t or &s;econd example Arithmeticall in this chapter. page 29; or if you put the longer &s;ide <HI>b c</HI> for radius, &s;ay, as the cour&s;e <HI>c</HI> to <HI>a b,</HI> &s;o the cour&s;e <HI>b</HI> to <HI>a c</HI> the longitude: but if you put the &s;ide <HI>a b</HI> for radius, &s;ay, as the totall &s;ine to the difference of latitude, &s;o the tangent <HI>a c</HI> to the difference of longitude: if the lea&s;t &s;ide be put for radius, &s;ay, as the tangent <HI>a b</HI> to the difference of lati|tude, &s;o the totall &s;ine to the difference of longitude.
