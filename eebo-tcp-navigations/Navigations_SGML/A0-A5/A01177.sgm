<HEAD><HI>A true di&s;cour&s;e of an ouerthrow giuen to the</HI> armie of the Leaguers in Prouince, vpon Monday in Ea&s;ter vveeke, being the 15 day of Aprill la&s;t pa&s;t. 1591.</HEAD>
<P>_OVr gratious God &s;eemeth to &s;leepe for a &s;ea&s;on and to be carele&s;&s;e of his cho&s;en people, that he may bee glorified in his woonderfull workes, by bringing them which tru&s;t to much in humain &s;trength into the con&s;ideration of his vn&s;peakeable power, who taketh plea&s;ure in y^e &s;trength of men, but &s;cattereth the great ho&s;ts and &s;quadrons of &s;uch as arme them&s;elues contrarie to his will, euen as chaffe before the winde, and in the twinckling of an eye (as it were) dooth &s;o abate their pride, that by the hand of a few of his people he bringeth them to nought, ma|king them equall with the du&s;t, and leauing them as a preie to be deuoured of woolues, and &s;uch lyke rauenous bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>The enemies had great confidence in the King of <HI>Spaine</HI> (now called out of this worlde to render an account before the &s;oueraign Monarch, of the manifold extor&s;ions and no|torious cruelties committed by him) who a&s;&s;ured the~&s;elues that he would &s;end &s;o many men of warre into all partes of Fraunce (as he hath done, though in vaine) that in &s;horte time he might vanqui&s;h and &s;ubdue the king and gaine his Crowne. For the &s;ame cau&s;e, vpon the death of this Arch-tyrant king, the duke of <HI>Sauoy</HI> is gone into <HI>Spaine,</HI> and hath giuen ouer the enterpri&s;e he purpo&s;ed again&s;t the towne of <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> which by &s;undrie waies and meanes he had prac|ti&s;ed
<PB REF="3"> with diuers of the inhabitants who receiued into their town &s;ome &s;tore of corne, cau&s;ing &s;uch men as they &s;u&s;pected and would not be conformable to their wils, to for&s;ake the town, which things they had done by &s;o much the more wil|lingly as they &s;uffered the~ to &s;lip ea&s;ilie into the nets of their rebellion, &s;ome of their owne accord, &s;ome others by y^t helpe and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a pui&s;&s;ant armie of the Spaniards, Sa|uoiens, and Prouincials which marched within the coun|trey vnder the conduct of the <HI>Count Martine~ga,</HI> of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de Vitelli</HI> Colonel of the duke of <HI>Sauoies</HI> hor&s;emen leaguers, and of <HI>Mon&s;. S. Romani</HI> general of the footmen who know|ing that <HI>Me&s;sieurs D'E&s;diguieres</HI> and <HI>Lauallette,</HI> were ioined on that &s;ide which <HI>Riez</HI> lieth on, and that <HI>Mon&s;. Lauallette</HI> was departed for the &s;ame intent from <HI>Ci&s;teron</HI> the 13 daye of Aprill, hauing cau&s;ed certaine peeces of ordinaunce to bee brought with their troopes, and &s;eing likewi&s;e y^t they might greatly hinder their enterpri&s;es, re&s;olued to approach neare vnto them, not &s;o much to prouoke them to a battle, in that they were foure to one, as thinking to keepe them at a baye, and &s;o cau&s;e them to retire. But they could not bee ignorant hauing had &s;o great proofe of the wi&s;e conduct, &s;ingular watchfulnes, and pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;&s;e of this valiant Cap|tain <HI>Mon&s;. D'E&s;diguieres,</HI> who being aided by the venterous champion <HI>Seigneur Lauallette,</HI> and armed with a iu&s;t cau&s;e in defence of their king and &s;tate, not fearing the great num|ber of the enemies, whome with courage and re&s;olution he valiauntly charged &s;o oft as there was occa&s;ion, as maye more euidently appeare by this di&s;cour&s;e en&s;uing.</P>
<P><HI>Sparron</HI> is a village and a ca&s;tell in <HI>Prouince,</HI> about fyue leagues from <HI>Aix,</HI> the Lord whereof in times pa&s;t held him|&s;elfe newter, taking neither partie: neuerthele&s;&s;e hee enter|tayned in his Ca&s;tell the Lord gouernour of the partie roy|all and his troupe. A great number of the Sauoien hor&s;e|men
<PB REF="3"> went to lodge in the &s;ame village of <HI>Sparron.</HI> Now <HI>Me&s;|&s;ieurs D'E&s;diguieres</HI> and <HI>Lauallette</HI> receiuing aduerti&s;ement of the enemies being there, without delay they marched thi|ther al&s;o with their forces, and on monday in Ea&s;ter weke being the 15 of the &s;ame moneth did a&s;&s;aile them with &s;uch fury and re&s;olution that in a &s;hort &s;pace recouering the be&s;t aduantage, they gaue them an vtter ouerthrow: they tooke 15 En&s;igns, foure Cornets from the hor&s;emen, 500 hor&s;es who&s;e owners lay dead in the place, &amp; aboue 250 gentlemen wel mounted were caried away pri&s;oners by a compo&s;ition made at the &s;ame time in the village. The <HI>Seigneur</HI> of <HI>Vitelly,</HI> collonell of the duke of Sauoies hor&s;emen leaguers, and <HI>Mon&s;. S. Romani,</HI> generall of the enemies footmen did yeelde them&s;elues pri&s;oners al&s;o. The Frenchmen of <HI>Prouince</HI> wer &s;ent home to their hou&s;es by the &s;aid Lordes <HI>D' E&s;diguieres</HI> &amp; <HI>Lauallette</HI> with each one a white &s;tick in his hand. More then 500 Sauoiens were &s;ent to <HI>Tollon</HI> to <HI>Mon&s;. Lauallette</HI> his gallies, therein requiting the duke of <HI>Sauoy</HI> with &s;uch mea|&s;ure as he had meated vnto &s;ome of y^e kings troups before. The mo&s;t part of the forts &amp; &s;trong holds of <HI>Prouince,</HI> wher|of the rebels had commaundement, hearing of &s;o great an ouerthrow to be giuen their &s;ide, are reduced &amp; brought vn|der the kings obedience excepting only the citie of <HI>Aix</HI> which y^e &s;aid Lords haue with al diligence enuironed &amp; blocked in</P>
<P>The <HI>Count Martinenga</HI> who had the leading of 800 Hor&s;e|men perceiuing that there was nothing to be gayned but blowes, &amp; that the &s;aid Lords &amp; their troups &s;pared not to lay on loade, re&s;olued therefore to tru&s;t to their legges and to &s;aue them&s;elues by flight with 300 hor&s;e which were al y^t could e&s;cape from that encounter: the re&s;t were all either &s;layne or taken: &amp; our &s;ouldiers &amp; men of war, be&s;ides ma|ny riche pri&s;oners, got in this conflicte about 350. hor&s;&s;es of &s;eruice, there were al&s;o thirtye Captaynes taken be&s;ides the two commaunders. <HI>Mon&s;. Lauallette</HI> hath armed two galleys at <HI>Tollon:</HI> &amp; the&s;e two noble Lords pro&s;ecuting their notable victory haue wonne y^e towns of <HI>Digne</HI> and <HI>Lines,</HI> and it is &s;aid that <HI>Mouglon</HI> is now in parle to render vnto the king and to &s;hake off the rebellious yoke.</P>
<PB REF="4">
<P>Thus we &s;ee that humaine forces with&s;tanding the ordi|naunces of God, are in a moment ouerwhelmed.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Spaine</HI> is dead, who was the greate&s;t &s;uppor|ter of the league, &amp; the rebellion in Fraunce. The Leaguers haue lo&s;t a pui&s;&s;ant armie of Spaniards, Sauoiens, and other &s;trangers in <HI>Prouince,</HI> which is now God be thanked almo&s;t all &s;ubdued. <HI>Italy</HI> is di&s;burdened &s;undrye waies, by the death of this tyrant. The King on the other &s;ide is proui|dent in his affaires, which the Lord doth daily pro&s;per with his heauenly ble&s;&s;ing. Moreouer there are two regiments of <HI>VVallons</HI> defeated in <HI>Picardy.</HI> God exerci&s;eth his iu&s;tice more and more vpon his enimies, &s;eeing that the clemencie of the Prince whome hee hath giuen vnto vs &s;erueth to no purpo&s;e to bring them to rea&s;on, and that now at this in|&s;tant they are &s;o &s;tubborne, that vnder the Duke of <HI>Maines</HI> authoritie, they will at a certaine day of the moneth haue a conuention of all their parti&s;ans rebels in the town of <HI>Reins</HI> there to hold an a&s;&s;embly of e&s;tates to con&s;ult of the affairs of the league, which are in a pittifull taking vpon the vnex|pected death of the king of <HI>Spaine,</HI> which is &s;o preiudiciall to their rebellious faction.</P>
<P><HI>Moun&s;ieur de Nemours</HI> to counterpoi&s;e a matter &s;o wor|thy of regard by the rebels in <HI>Prouince,</HI> &amp; thinking to mende vp that which was &s;o torne on their &s;ide, being at <HI>Lions</HI> a little after this ouerthrow giuen, &s;ent into <HI>Daulphine</HI> three or foure hundred hor&s;&s;e, carrieng with them good &s;tore of ladders and Petarts, and hauing pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Li&s;er</HI> towards <HI>la Roche,</HI> and leauing their hor&s;&s;es on this &s;ide, marched a league on foot being armed, and would haue planted their ladders, and giuen a &s;kalado to <HI>Valence,</HI> but they came not within mu&s;quet &s;hot thereof: for returning in ha&s;t beeing pur&s;ued, they left 37 ladders in a barne, within a quarter of a league of <HI>Valence.</HI> They had &s;o ill &s;urce&s;&s;e through their
<PB REF="4"> long retreat that they lo&s;t 80 or 100 of their hor&s;es, wherof &s;ome were woorth 800 crownes, and yet were con&s;trained to returne againe without doing any &s;eruice.</P>
<P>The Leaguers being but a few which could e&s;cape at the ouer throw of <HI>Sparron</HI> haue &s;ente to &s;eeke their mai&s;ter the duke of <HI>Sauoy</HI> in <HI>Spaine,</HI> and are in great perplexitie becau&s;e they heare no newes of his Excellencie. He hath lo&s;t more by his departure than he &s;hall gaine at his returne.</P>
<P>We are to giue God thanks for &s;o many ble&s;&s;ings wher|with it plea&s;eth him to endue the King and his affairs to re|comfort in the end his good &s;ubiects &s;o much oppre&s;&s;ed, and almo&s;t burnt as it were with the fire of ciuill wars, kindled by the rebels, who go about to continue it: howbeit the king of compa&s;&s;ion vpon the poore &amp; mi&s;erable e&s;tate of his &s;ub|iects, more than of de&s;ire to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elfe in that which appertaineth vnto him, doth enforce him&s;elfe by all meanes and chiefly by his mildne&s;&s;e, mercifulne&s;&s;e and clemencie towardes the vanqui&s;hed rebels, to quenche and put out wholy this fire which they &s;ought to entertaine, where|by his people and commonwealth might flori&s;h in an vniuer&s;all peace.</P>
