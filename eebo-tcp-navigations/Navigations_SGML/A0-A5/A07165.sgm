<P>A RELATION Of the Lord BALTEMORE'S Plantation in <HI>Maryland.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_HIs mo&s;t Excellent Maje&s;tie Having by His Letters Pa|tents, under the Great Seale of <HI>England,</HI> granted a certaine Countrey in <HI>Ame|rica</HI> (now called <HI>Maryland,</HI> in honour of our gratious Queene) unto the Lord <HI>Bal|temore,</HI> with divers Priviledges, and encou|ragements to all tho&s;e that &s;hould aduenture with his Lord&s;hip in the planting of that Co~n|trey: the benefit and honour of &s;uch an action was readily apprehended by divers Gentlemen, of good birth and qualitie, who thereupon re|&s;olued to aduenture their per&s;ons, and a good
<PB N="2" REF="3">
part of their fortunes with his Lord&s;hip, in the pur&s;uite of &s;o noble and (in all likelihood) &s;o aduantagious an enterprize. His Lord&s;hip was at fir&s;t re&s;olued to goe in per&s;on; but the more important rea&s;ons per&s;wading his &s;tay at home, hee appointed his brother, Mr. <HI>Leonard Caluert</HI> to goe Governour in his &s;tead, with whom he joyned in Commi&s;&s;ion, Mr. <HI>Ierome Hawley,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thomas Cornwallis</HI> (two worthy and able Gentlemen.) The&s;e with the other Gentlemen aduenturers, and their &s;eruants, to the number of neere 200. people, imbarked the~&s;elues for the voyage, in the good &s;hip called the <HI>Arke,</HI> of 300. tunne &amp; upward, which was attended by his Lord&s;hips Pinnace, called the <HI>Dove,</HI> of about 50. tunne. And &s;o on Friday, the 22. of <HI>November,</HI> 1633. a &s;mall gale of winde comming gently from the <HI>North-West,</HI> they weighed from the <HI>Cowes</HI> in the <HI>I&s;le</HI> of <HI>Wight,</HI> about ten in the morning; And having &s;tayed by the way Twenty dayes at the <HI>Barbada's,</HI> and Fourteene dayes at Saint <HI>Chri&s;tophers</HI> (upon &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions) they arrived at <HI>Point Comfort</HI> in <HI>Virginia,</HI> on the foure &amp; twentyeth of <HI>February</HI> following. They had Letters from his Maje&s;ty, in favor of them, to the Governour of <HI>Virginia,</HI> in obedience whereunto, he u&s;ed them with much courte&s;ie and humanitie. At this time, one Captaine <HI>Cleyborne</HI> (one of the Councel of <HI>Virginia</HI>) com|ming
<PB N="3" REF="3">
from the parts whether they intended to goe, told them that all the Natives were in preparation of defence by rea&s;on of a rumor &s;ome had rai&s;ed among&s;t them, that 6. &s;hippes were to come with many people, who would drive all the inhabitants out of the Countrey.</P>
<P>On the 3. of <HI>March,</HI> they left <HI>Point Comfort,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Patowmeck,</HI> is a great <HI>River</HI> of the Pro|vince of <HI>Ma|ryland&punc;</HI> on which they intend<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">d, to &s;eate the fir&s;t <HI>Colony.</HI></NOTE> &amp; 2. dayes after, they came to <HI>Patowmeck</HI> river, which is about 24. leagues di&s;tant, there they began to give names to places, and called the <HI>Southerne</HI> point of that River, Saint <HI>Gregories;</HI> and the <HI>Northerne</HI> point, Saint <HI>Michaels.</HI></P>
<P>They &s;ayled up the River, till they came to <HI>Heron</HI> Iland, which is about 14. leagues, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">So called from the a|boundance of that Fowle there.</NOTE> there came to an Anchor under an I&s;land neere unto it, which they called S. <HI>Clements.</HI> Where they &s;et up a Cro&s;&s;e, and tooke po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this Countrey for our <HI>Saviour,</HI> and for our So|veraigne Lord the King of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Heere the Governor thought fit for the &s;hip to &s;tay, vntill hee had di&s;covered more of the Countrey: and &s;o hee tooke two Pinnaces, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">The <HI>Dove,</HI> and one hyred in <HI>Virgin<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">a.</HI></NOTE> went up the River &s;ome 4. leagues, and landed on the <HI>South</HI> &s;ide, where he found the <HI>Indians</HI> fled for feare, from thence hee &s;ayled &s;ome 9. leagues higher to <HI>Patowmeck</HI> Towne where the <HI>Werowance</HI> being a child, <HI>Archibau</HI> his vnckle<NOTE PLACE="marg">So they call their Princes.</NOTE> (who governed him and his Countrey for him) gave all the company good wellcome, and one of the company having entered into a little di&s;|cour&s;e
<PB N="4" REF="4">
with him, touching the errours of their religion, hee &s;eemed well plea&s;ed there|with; and at his going away, de&s;ired him to re|turne thither againe, &s;aying he &s;hould live with him, his men &s;hould hunt for him, and hee would divide all with him.</P>
<P>From hence the Governor went to <HI>Pa&s;ehatoway,</HI> about 20. leagues higher, where he found many <HI>Indians</HI> a&s;&s;embled, and heere he met with one Captaine <HI>Henry Fleete</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h-man,</HI> who had lived many yeeres among the <HI>Indians,</HI> and by that meanes &s;pake the Countrey language very well, and was much e&s;teemed of by the natives. Him our Governour &s;ent a &s;hore to invite the <HI>Werowance</HI> to a parley, who thereupon came with him aboard privatly, where he was courte|ou&s;ly entertained, and after &s;ome parley being demanded by the Governour, whether hee would be content that he and his people &s;hould &s;et downe in his Countrey, in ca&s;e he &s;hould find a place conuenient for him, his an&s;were was, <Q><HI>that he would not bid him goe, neither would &amp; hee bid him &s;tay, but that he might u&s;e his owne di&s;cretion.</HI></Q></P>
<P>While this <HI>Werowance</HI> was aboard, many of his people came to the water &s;ide, fearing that he might be &s;urpri&s;ed, whereupon the <HI>Wero|wance</HI> commanded two <HI>Indians</HI> that came with him, to goe on &s;hore, to quit them of this feare, but they an&s;wered, they feared they wou'd kill
<PB N="5" REF="4">
them; The <HI>Werowance</HI> therefore &s;hewed him|&s;elfe upon the decke, and told them hee was in &s;afety, wherewith they were &s;atisfied.</P>
<P>While&s;t the Governour was abroad, the neighbouring <HI>Indians,</HI> where the &s;hip lay, be|gan to ca&s;t off feare, and to come to their Court of guard, which they kept night and day upon Saint <HI>Clements</HI> Ile, partly to defend their barge, which was brought in pieces out of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> and there made up; and partly to defend their men which were imployed in felling of trees, and cleaving pales for a Palizado, and at la&s;t they ventured to come aboard the &s;hip.</P>
<P>The Governour finding it not fit, for many rea&s;ons, to &s;eate him&s;elfe as yet &s;o high in the River, re&s;olued to returne backe againe, and to take a more exact view of the lower parts, and &s;o leaving the Ship &amp; Pinnaces there, he tooke his Barge (as mo&s;t fit to &s;earch the Creekes, and &s;mall rivers) and was conducted by Cap|taine <HI>Fleete</HI> (who knew well the Countrey) to a River on the North-&s;ide of <HI>Patomeck</HI> river, within 4. or 5. leagues from the mouth thereof, which they called Saint <HI>Georges</HI> River. They went up this river about 4. Leagues, and an|chored at the Towne of <HI>Yoacomaco:</HI> from whence the <HI>Indians</HI> of that part of the Coun|trey, are called the <HI>Yoacomacoes:</HI></P>
<P>At their comming to this place, the Go|vernour went on &s;hoare, and treated friendly
<PB N="6" REF="5">
with the <HI>Werowance</HI> there, and acquainted him with the intent of his comming thither, to which hee made little an&s;were (as it is their manner, to any new or &s;uddaine que&s;tion) but entertained him, and his company that night in his hou&s;e, and gave him his owne bed to lie on (which is a matt layd on boords) and the next day, went to &s;hew him the country; and that day being &s;pent in viewing the places about that towne, and the fre&s;h waters, which there are ve|ry plentifull, and excellent good (but the maine rivers are &s;alt) the Governor determined to make the fir&s;t Colony there, and &s;o gave or|der for the Ship and Pinnaces to come thither.</P>
<P>This place he found to be a very commodi|ous &s;ituation for a Towne, in regard the land is good&punc; the ayre whol&s;ome and plea&s;ant, the Ri|ver affords a &s;afe harbour for &s;hips of any bur|then, and a very bould &s;hoare; fre&s;h water, and wood there is in great plenty, and the place &s;o naturally fortified, as with little difficultie, it will be defended from any enemie.</P>
<P>To make his entry peaceable and &s;afe, hee thought fit to pre&s;ent the <HI>Werowance</HI> and the <HI>Wi&s;oes</HI> of the Towne with &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">So they call the chiefe men of Ac|compt a|mong&s;t them.</NOTE> (&s;uch as is u&s;ed in trade with the <HI>Indians</HI>) Ax|es, Howes, and Knives, which they accepted very kindly, and freely gave con&s;ent that hee and his company &s;hould dwell in one part of their Towne, and re&s;erued the other for them|&s;elues:
<PB N="7" REF="5">
and tho&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> that dwelt in that part of the Towne, which was allotted for the <HI>Engli&s;h&punc;</HI> freely left them their hou&s;es, and &s;ome corne that they had begun to plant: It was al&s;o agreed between them, that at the end of harue&s;t they &s;hould leave the whole towne; which they did accordingly: And they made mutuall pro|mi&s;es to each other, to live friendly and peace|ably together, and if any injury &s;hould happen to be done on any part, that &s;atisfaction &s;hould be made for the &s;ame, and thus upon the 27. day of <HI>March, Anno Domini,</HI> 1634. the Go|vernour tooke po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the place, and na|med the Towne Saint <HI>Maries.</HI></P>
<P>There was an occa&s;ion that much facilita|ted their treaty with the&s;e <HI>Indians,</HI> which was this: The <HI>Sa&s;quehanocks</HI> (a warlike people that inhabite betweene <HI>Che&s;opeack</HI> bay, and <HI>Dela|ware</HI> bay) did v&s;ually make warres, and incur|&s;ions upon the neighbouring <HI>Indians,</HI> partly for &s;uperiority, partly for to get their Wo|men, and what other purcha&s;e they could meet with, which the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>Yocomaco</HI> fearing, had the yeere before our arivall there, made a re&s;olution, for their &s;afety, to remove them|&s;elues higher into the Countrey where it was more populous, and many of them were gone thither before the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> arrived.</P>
<P>Three dayes after their comming to <HI>Yoacoma|co</HI> the Arke with the two Pinaces arived there.
<PB N="8" REF="6">
The <HI>Indians</HI> much wondred to &s;ee &s;uch &s;hips, and at the thundering of the Ordnance when they came to an Anchor.</P>
<P>The next day they began to prepare for their hou&s;es, and fir&s;t o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> all a Court of Guard, and a Store-hou&s;e; in the meane time they lay a|bord the &s;hip: They had not beene there many dayes before <HI>Sir Iohn Haruie</HI> the governor of <HI>V<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">rginea</HI> came thither to vi&s;it them; Al&s;o &s;ome Indian <HI>Werowances,</HI> and many other Indians f<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="missing" EXTENT="1 letter">om &s;everall parts came to &s;ee them, among&s;t others the <HI>Werowance</HI> of <HI>Patuxent</HI> came to vi&s;it the Governour, and being brought into the great Cabin of the &s;hip, was placed betweene the Governour of <HI>Virginea,</HI> and the Governour of <HI>Mary-land;</HI> and a <HI>Patuxent</HI> Indian that came with him, comming into the Cabin, and find|ing the <HI>Werowance</HI> thus &s;itting betweene the two Governours, &s;tarted backe, fearing the <HI>We|rowance</HI> was &s;urpri&s;ed, and was ready to have leapt overboard, and could not be per&s;waded to come into the Cabin, untill the <HI>Werowance</HI> came him&s;elfe unto him; for he remembred how the &s;aid <HI>Werowance</HI> had formerly beene ta|ken pri&s;oner by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of <HI>Virginia.</HI></P>
<P>After they had fini&s;hed the &s;tore-hou&s;e, and unladed the &s;hip, the Governour thought fit to bring the Colours on &s;hore, which were atten|ded by all the Gentlemen, and the re&s;t of the &s;ervants in armes; who received the Colours
<PB N="9" REF="6">
with a volley of &s;hot, which was an&s;wered by the Ordnance from the &s;hips; At this Cere|mony were pre&s;ent, the <HI>Werowances</HI> of <HI>Patuxent,</HI> and <HI>Yoacomaco,</HI> with many other Indians; and the <HI>Werowance</HI> of <HI>Patuxent</HI> hereupon tooke oc|ca&s;ion to advi&s;e the Indians of <HI>Yoacomaco</HI> to be carefull to keepe the league that they had made with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> He &s;tayed with them divers dayes, and u&s;ed many Indian Comple|ments, and at his departure hee &s;aid to the Go|vernour. <Q>I loue the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;o well, that if they &s;hould goe about to kill me, if I had but &s;o much breath as to &s;peake; I would com|mand the people, not to revenge my death&punc; for I know they would not doe &s;uch a thing, except it were through mine owne default.</Q></P>
<P>They brought thither with them &s;ome &s;tore of Indian Corne, from the <HI>Barbado's,</HI> which at their fir&s;t arivall they began to v&s;e (thinking fit to re&s;erve their Engli&s;h provi&s;ion of Meale and Oatemeale) and the Indian women &s;eeing their &s;ervants to bee unacquainted with the manner of dre&s;&s;ing it, would make bread there|of for them, and teach them how to doe the like: They found al&s;o the countrey well &s;tored with Corne (which they bought with truck, &s;uch as there is de&s;ired, the Natiues having no knowledge of the u&s;e of money) whereof they &s;old them &s;uch plenty, as that they &s;ent 1000. bu&s;hells of it to <HI>New-England,</HI> to provide them
<PB N="10" REF="7">
&s;ome &s;alt-fi&s;h, and other commodities which they wanted.</P>
<P>During the time that the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;tai'd by the Engli&s;h at <HI>Yoacomaco,</HI> they went dayly to hunt with them for Deere and Turkies, wherof &s;ome they gaue them for Pre&s;ents, and the meaner &s;ort would &s;ell them to them, for knives, beades and the like: Al&s;o of Fi&s;h, the natives brought them great &s;tore, and in all things dealt very friendly with them; their women and children came very frequently among&s;t them, which was a certaine &s;igne of their confidence of them, it being found by experience, that they never at|tempt any ill, where the women are, or may be in danger.</P>
<P>Their comming thus to &s;eate upon an Indi|an Towne, where they found ground cleered to their hands, gave them opportunity (al|though they came late in the yeere) to plant &s;ome Corne, and to make them gardens, which they &s;owed with Engli&s;h &s;eeds of all &s;orts, and they pro&s;pered exceeding well. They al&s;o made what ha&s;te they could to fini&s;h their hou&s;es; but before they could accompli&s;h all the&s;e things, one Captaine <HI>Cleyborne</HI> (who had a de&s;ire to appropriate the trade of tho&s;e parts unto him&s;elfe) began to ca&s;t out words among&s;t the Indians, &s;aying, That tho&s;e of <HI>Yoacomaco</HI> were <HI>Spaniards</HI> and his enemies; and by this meanes endeavoured to alienate the mindes of
<PB N="11" REF="7">
the Natives from them, &s;o that they did not re|ceive them &s;o friendly as formerly they had done. This cau&s;ed them to lay a&s;ide all other workes, and to fini&s;h their Fort, which they did within the &s;pace of one moneth; where they mounted &s;ome Ordnance, and furni&s;hed it with &s;ome murtherers, and &s;uch other meanes of de|fence as they thought fit for their &s;afeties: which being done, they proceeded with their Hou&s;es and fini&s;hed them, with convenient ac|commodations belonging thereto: And al|though they had thus put them&s;elves in &s;afety, yet they cea&s;ed not to procure to put the&s;e jea|lou&s;ies out of the Natives minds, by treating and v&s;ing them in the mo&s;t courteous manner they could, and at la&s;t prevailed therein, and &s;et|led a very firme peace and friend&s;hip with them. They procured from <HI>Virginia,</HI> Hogges, Poultrey, and &s;ome Cowes, and &s;ome male cat|tell, which hath given them a foundation for breed and increa&s;e; and who&s;o de&s;ires it, may furni&s;h him&s;elfe with &s;tore of Cattell from thence, but the hogges and Poultrey are already increa&s;ed in <HI>Maryland,</HI> to a great &s;tocke, &s;uffici|ent to &s;erve the Colonie very plentifully. They have al&s;o &s;et up a Water-mill for the grinding of Corne, adjoyning to the Towne.</P>
<P>Thus within the &s;pace of &s;ixe moneths, was laid the foundation of the Colonie in <HI>Mary|land;</HI> and who&s;oever intends now to goe thi|ther,
<PB N="12" REF="8">
&s;hall finde the way &s;o troden, that hee may proceed with much more ea&s;e and confi|dence then the&s;e fir&s;t adventurers could, who were ignorant both of Place, People, and all things el&s;e, and could expect to find nothing but what nature produced: be&s;ides, they could not in rea&s;on but thinke, the Natives would op|po&s;e them; whereas now the Countrey is di&s;|covered, and friend&s;hip with the Natives is a&s;|&s;ured, hou&s;es built, and many other accom|modations, as Cattell, Hogges, Poultry, Fruits and the like brought thither from <HI>England, Virginea,</HI> and other places, which are v&s;efull, both for profit and Plea&s;ure: and without boa|&s;ting it may be &s;aid, that this Colony hath a|rived to more in &s;ixe moneths, then <HI>Virginia</HI> did in as many yeeres. If any man &s;ay, they are beholding to <HI>Virginea</HI> for &s;o &s;peedy a &s;upply of many of tho&s;e things which they of <HI>Virginia</HI> were forced to fetch from <HI>England</HI> and other remote places, they will confe&s;&s;e it, and ac|knowledge them&s;elves glad that <HI>Virginea</HI> is &s;o neere a neighbour, and that it is &s;o well &s;tored of all nece&s;&s;aries for to make tho&s;e parts happy, and the people to live as plentifully as in any o|ther part of the world, only they wi&s;h that they would be content their neighbours might live in peace by them, and then no doubt they &s;hould find a great comfort each in other.</P>

<P>The temper of the Ayre is very good, and a|grees well with the Engli&s;h, as appeared at their fir&s;t comming thither, when they had no hou&s;es to &s;helter them, and their people were
<PB N="14" REF="15">
enforced, not onely to labour in the day, but to watch in their turnes at night, yet had their healths exceeding well: In Summer its hot as in <HI>Spaine,</HI> and in Winter there is fro&s;t and &s;now, but it &s;eldome la&s;ts long&punc; this la&s;t Win|ter was the colde&s;t that had beene knowne in many yeeres: but the yeere before, there was &s;carce any &s;igne of Winter, onely that the leaves fell from the trees, in all other things it appeared to be Summer; and yet the la&s;t Win|ter, both their Cattell and Hoggs kept them|&s;elves in the woods, without any fodder, or o|ther helpe, and the Hoggs thrived &s;o well, that &s;ome of them were killed out of the woods for Porke and Bacon, which was excellent good and fat.</P>
<P>The Windes there are variable; from the South comes Heat, Gu&s;ts, and Thunder; from the North, or North-we&s;t, cold-weather, and in winter, Fro&s;t and Snow; from the Ea&s;t and South-ea&s;t, Raine.</P>
<P>The ordinary entrance by Sea into this Countrey, is betweene two Capes, which are di&s;tant each from other, about 7 or 8 leagves, the South-Cape is called <HI>Cape-Henry;</HI> the North, <HI>Cape-Charles,</HI> When you are come within the <HI>Capes,</HI> you enter into a faire Bay, which is navigable for at lea&s;t 200 miles, and is called <HI>Che&s;opeack</HI> Bay, and runneth Norther|ly: Into this Bay fall many goodly navigable

<P>_THis Countrey affords naturally, many excellent things for Phy|&s;icke and Surgery, the perfect u&s;e of which, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> can|not yet learne from the Na|tives: They have a roote which is an excellent pre&s;eruative again&s;t Poy&s;on, called by the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> the <HI>Snake roote.</HI> Other herbes and rootes they have, wherewith they cure all manner of woundes; al&s;o <HI>Saxafras,</HI> Gummes, and <HI>Bal&s;um.</HI> An <HI>Indian</HI> &s;eeing one of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> much troubled with the tooth-ake, fetched of the roote of a tree, and gave the par|ty &s;ome of it to hold in his mouth, and it ea&s;ed the paine pre&s;ently.

There is al&s;o Walnut, Cedar, Pine, &amp; Cipre&s;&s;e, Che&s;|nut, Elme, A&s;he, and Popler, all which are for Building, and Husbandry. Al&s;o there are di|vers &s;orts of Fruit-trees, as Mulberries, Per&s;i|mons, with &s;everall other kind of Plummes, and Vines, in great aboundance.

<P>In Winter there is great plenty of Swannes, Cranes, Gee&s;e, Herons, Ducke, Teale, Widge|on, Brants, and Pidgeons, with other &s;orts, whereof there are none in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The Sea, the Bayes of <HI>Che&s;opeack,</HI> and <HI>Dela|ware,</HI> and generally all the Rivers, doe abound with Fi&s;h of &s;everall &s;orts; for many of them we have no <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> names: There are Whales, Sturgeons uery large and good, and in great a|boundance; Grampu&s;es, Porpu&s;es, Mullets, Ttouts, Soules, Place, Mackerell, Perch, Crabs, Oy&s;ters, Cockles, and Mu&s;sles; But above all the&s;e, the fi&s;h that have no Engli&s;h names, are the be&s;t except the Sturgeons: There is al&s;o a fi&s;h like the Thornebacke in <HI>England,</HI> which hath a taile a yard long, wherein are &s;harpe prickles, with which if it &s;trike a man, it will put him to much paine and torment, but it is very good meate: al&s;o the Tode-fi&s;h, which will &s;well till it be ready to bur&s;t, if it be taken out of the water.</P>

<P>IN the fir&s;t place I name Corne, as the thing mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to &s;u&s;taine man; That which the Natives u&s;e in the Countrey, makes very good bread, and al&s;o a meate which they call <HI>Omene,</HI> it's like our <HI>Furmety,</HI> and is very &s;avory and whole&s;ome; it will Mault and make good Beere. Al&s;o the Natives have a &s;ort of <HI>Pul&s;e,</HI> which we call <HI>Pea&s;e</HI> and <HI>Beanes,</HI> that are very good.

<P>They have made tryall of Engli&s;h <HI>Pea&s;e,</HI> and they grow very well, al&s;o <HI>Musk-mellons, Water|mellons, Com-cumbers,</HI> with all &s;orts of garden Roots and Herbes, as <HI>Carrots, Par&s;enips, Turnips, Cabbages Radi&s;h&punc;</HI> with many more; and in <HI>Vir|ginia</HI> they have &s;owed Engli&s;h <HI>Wheate</HI> and <HI>Bar|ley,</HI> and it yeelds twi&s;e as much increa&s;e as in <HI>England;</HI> and although there be not many that doe apply them&s;elves to plant Gardens and Orchards, yet tho&s;e that doe it, find much pro|fit

and plea&s;ure thereby: They have Peares, Ap|ples, and &s;everall &s;orts of Plummes, Peaches in abundance, and as good as tho&s;e of <HI>Italy;</HI> &s;o are the Mellons and Pumpions: Apricocks, Figgs and Pomegranates pro&s;per exceedingly; they haue lately planted Orange and Limon trees which thrive very wel: and in fine, there is &s;carce any fruit that growes in <HI>England, France, Spaine,</HI> or <HI>Italy,</HI> but hath been tryed there, and pro&s;pers well.

There may be had, Silke-wormes, the Countrey being &s;tored with Mulberries: and the &s;uperfluity of wood will produce Pota&s;hes.</P>
<P>And for <HI>Wine,</HI> there is no doubt but it will be made there in plenty, for the ground doth naturally bring foorth Vines, in &s;uch aboun|dance, that they are as frequent there, as Bram|bles are here. <HI>Iron</HI> may be made there with little charge; Brave &s;hips may be built, without re|quiring any materialls from other parts: Clab|board, Wain&s;cott, Pipe&s;taves and Ma&s;ts for &s;hips the woods will afford plentifully.

<P>_HEE that hath a Curio&s;ity to know all that hath beene ob&s;erued of the Cu&s;tomes and manners of the <HI>Indians,</HI> may find large di&s;cour&s;es thereof in Captaine <HI>Smiths</HI> Booke of <HI>Virginia,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Woods</HI> of <HI>New-England:</HI> but he that is de&s;irous to goe to <HI>Maryland,</HI> &s;hall heere find enough to informe him of what is nece&s;&s;ary for him to know touching them.
<PB N="25" REF="20">
By Captaine <HI>Smith's,</HI> and many other Relati|ons you may be informed, that the People are War-licke, and have done much harme to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and thereby are made very terrible. Others &s;ay that they are a ba&s;e and cowardly People, and to be contemned: and it is thought by &s;ome who would be e&s;teemed State&s;-men, that the only point of pollicie that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> can u&s;e, is, to de&s;troy the <HI>Indians,</HI> or to drive them out of the Countrey, without which, it is not to be hoped that they can be &s;ecure. The truth is, if they be injured, they may well be feared, they being People that have able bo|dies, and generally, taller, and bigger limbed then the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and want not courage; but the oddes wee have of them in our weapons, keepes them in awe, otherwi&s;e they would not flie from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> as they have done in the time of Warres with tho&s;e of <HI>Virginia,</HI> and out of that re&s;pect&punc; a &s;mall number of our men being armed, will aduenture upon a great troope of theirs, and for no other rea&s;on, for they are re|&s;olute and &s;ubtile enough: But from hence to conclude, that there can be no &s;afety to live with them, is a very great errour. Experience hath taught us, that by kind and faire u&s;age, the Natives are not onely become peaceable, but al&s;o friendly, and have upon all occa&s;ions per|formed as many friendly Offices to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>Maryland,</HI> and <HI>New-England,</HI> as any neigh|bour

or friend u&s;es to doe in the mo&s;t Civill parts of Chri&s;tendome: Therefore any wi&s;e man will hold it a far more ju&s;t and rea&s;onable way to treat the People of the Countrey well, thereby to induce them to civility, and to teach them the u&s;e of husbandry, and Mechanick trades, whereof they are capable, which may in time be very u&s;efull to the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and the Planters to keepe them&s;elues &s;trong, and united in Townes, at lea&s;t for a competent number, and then noe man can rea&s;onably doubt, either &s;ur|pri&s;e, or any other ill dealing from them.</P>
<P>But to proceede, hee that &s;ees them, may know how men lived while&s;t the world was un|der the Law of Nature; and as by nature, &s;o a|mong&s;t them, all men are free, but yet &s;ubject to command for the publike defence.

<PB N="27" REF="21">
they hold, that the i&s;&s;ue of the daughters hath more of his blood in them than the i&s;&s;ue of his &s;onnes. The <HI>Wi&s;oes</HI> are cho&s;en at the plea&s;ure of the <HI>Werowance,</HI> yet commonly they are cho|&s;en of the &s;ame family, if they be of yeeres ca|pable: The yong men generally beare a very great re&s;pect to the elder.</P>

The women &s;erve their husbands, make their bread, dre&s;&s;e their meate, &s;uch as they kill in hunting, or get by fi&s;hing; and if they have more wives then one, as &s;ome of them have (but that is not generall) then the be&s;t beloved wife performes all the offices of the hou&s;e, and they take great coment therein.

<P>The women remaine with their Parents un|till they have husbands, and if the Parents bee dead, then with &s;ome other of their friends. If the husband die, he leaves all that he hath to his wife, except his bow and arrowes, and &s;ome Beades (which they u&s;ually bury with them) and &s;he is to keepe the children untill the &s;ons come to be men, and then they live where they plea&s;e, for all mens hou&s;es are free unto them; and the daughters untill they have husbands. The manner of their marriages is thus; he that would have a wife, treates with the father, or if he be dead, with the friend that takes care of her whom he de&s;ires to have to wife, and agrees

with him for a quantity of Beades, or &s;ome &s;uch other thing which is accepted among&s;t them; which he is to give for her, and mu&s;t be payed at the day of their marriage; and then the day be|ing appointed, all the friends of both parts meet at the mans hou&s;e that is to have the wife, and each one brings a pre&s;ent of meate and the wo|man that is to be married al&s;o brings her pre|&s;ent: when the company is all come, the man he &s;its at the upper end of the hou&s;e, and the womans friends leade her up, and place her by him, then all the company &s;it down upon mats, on the ground (as their manner is) and the wo|man ri&s;eth and &s;erves dinner, Fir&s;t to her hus|band, then to all the company; the re&s;t of the day they &s;pend in &s;inging and dancing (which is not unplea&s;ant) at night the company leaves the~, and co~monly they live very peaceably and lovingly together; Yet it falls out &s;ometimes, that a man puts away one wife and takes ano|ther; then &s;he and her children returne to her friends again.

Nation, who de&s;ire to live in peace and love with you, and are ready to make &s;atisfaction for the Injury, de&s;iring to know what will give you content, and that they will returne &s;uch things as were then taken from thence; But withall, they de&s;ire you not to thinke that they doe this for feare, for they have warres with the <HI>Sa&s;quehanocks,</HI> who have by a &s;urpri&s;e, lately killed many of their men, but they would not &s;ue to them for peace, intending to revenge the injuries, as they could find opportunitie, yet their de&s;ire was to have peace with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></P></Q>
<P>The Governour returned an&s;were to the <HI>Wi|come&s;&s;e;</HI> &s;ince you acknowledge the Injury, and are &s;orry for it, and onely de&s;ire to know what I expect for &s;atisfaction; I tell you I expect that tho&s;e men, who have done this out-rage, &s;hould be delivered unto me, to doe with them as I &s;hall thinke fit, and likewi&s;e that you re|&s;tore all &s;uch things as you then tooke from the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and withall, charged him with a &s;econd Injury attempted upon &s;ome of his owne People, &s;ince that time, by the <HI>Wico|me&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Wicome&s;&s;e</HI> after a little pau&s;e, replyed; It is the manner among&s;t us <HI>Indians,</HI> that if any &s;uch like accident happen, wee doe redeeme the life of a man that is &s;o &s;laine, with a 100. armes length of <HI>Roaroke</HI> (which is a &s;ort of

<P>The Governour then told him; It &s;eemes you come not &s;ufficiently in&s;tructed in the bu|&s;ine&s;&s;e which wee have with the <HI>Wicome&s;&s;es,</HI> therefore tell them what I have &s;aid; and that I expect a &s;peedy an&s;were; and &s;o di&s;mi&s;t him.</P>
<P>It fell in the way of my di&s;cour&s;e, to &s;peake of the <HI>Indian</HI> money of tho&s;e parts, It is of two &s;orts, <HI>Wompompeag</HI> and <HI>Roanoake;</HI> both of them are made of a Fi&s;h-&s;hell, that they gather by the Sea &s;ide, <HI>Wompompeag</HI> is of the greater &s;ort, and <HI>Roanoake</HI> of the le&s;&s;er, and the <HI>Wompompeag</HI> is three times the value of <HI>Roanoake;</HI> and the&s;e &s;erue as Gold and Siluer doe heere; they barter al&s;o one commoditie for another, and are very glad of trafficke and commerce, &s;o farre as to &s;upply their nece&s;&s;ities: They &s;hew no great de&s;ire of heaping wealth, yet &s;ome they will have to be buryed with them; If they were Chri&s;tians, and would live &s;o free from cove|tou&s;ne&s;&s;e, and many other vices which abound in Chri&s;tendome, they would be a brave people.</P>
<P>I therefore conclude, that &s;ince God Almigh|ty hath made this Countrey &s;o large and fruit|full,
<PB N="37" REF="26">
and that the people be &s;uch as you have heard them de&s;cribed; It is much more Pru|dence and Charity, to Civilize, and make them Chri&s;tians, then to kill, robbe, and hunt them from place to place, as you would doe a wolfe. By reducing of them, God &s;hall be &s;erued, his Maje&s;ties Empire enlarged by the addition of many thou&s;and Subjects, as well as of large Territories, our Nation honoured, and the Planters them&s;elues enriched by the trafficke and commerce which may be had with them; and in many other things, they may be u&s;efull, but prejudiciall they cannot be, if it be not through their owne faults, by negligence of for|tifying them&s;elues, and not con&s;eruing milita|ry di&s;cipline.</P>
