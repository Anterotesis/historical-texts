<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF THE ISLAND AND CITY OF CANDIA. By E. G. Serjeant at Arms.</HEAD>
<P><FIGURE>
<P>This Table &s;heweth
wheareabout and how
this Iland Candia lyeth
betwixt Europe &amp; A&s;ia
and the Venetian &amp; Turke</P>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>THE Commonweal of <HI>Venice,</HI> for the Greatne&s;s,
Nobility, Riches, goodly Pallaces, Scituation, and
other good parts, is admirable among all the
Towns of <HI>Europe;</HI> the &s;cituation thereof being &s;o
commodious for all things, as it may be held rather a Di|vine
than a humane work. And although many Com|monweals
have exceeded it in greatne&s;s of Empire, in
multitudes of people, and in &s;tate; yet there was never any
Town &s;o &s;trangely &s;cituated nor &s;o &s;ecurely: But not to
detain you here, we &s;hall proceed to give you a &s;hort ac|count
of the I&s;land of <HI>Creta</HI> or of <HI>Candia.</HI> The I&s;land of
<HI>Creta</HI> (anciently &s;o called, or of <HI>Candia,</HI> as we now call it)
hath in length, from Ea&s;t to We&s;t about &s;ixty <HI>French</HI>
Leagues, and not above &s;ixteen Leagues in breadth, it is
about a hundred and twenty Leagues in circuit, going about
by Sea: Upon the We&s;t it hath the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea, to the
North that which carries the name of the <HI>Creti&s;h</HI> Sea, to
the South the <HI>Lybick,</HI> and to the Ea&s;t the <HI>Carpathien,</HI> as <HI>Pto|limey,</HI>
de&s;cribes it. It was famous in old time for that it
had an hundred Towns, and therefore the Greek Poet called
it <HI>Hecatompolis:</HI> The &s;cituation is more Ea&s;ternly than that
of the Countrey of <HI>Morea,</HI> lying betwixt the Counties of
<HI>Artica</HI> and that of <HI>Cyren,</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> being but two dayes
journey by Sea from either Province at this day, according
to <HI>Belonus:</HI> There are but three Towns of note in this
I&s;land, that is, <HI>Candia</HI> (in old time <HI>Matium)</HI> the chief of
this I&s;land, whereof it takes her name, then <HI>Canea</HI> &s;ome|times
<HI>Sidon</HI> and <HI>Rhetinno;</HI> it hath a port which is not very
commodious, but tho&s;e of <HI>Cania</HI> and <HI>Candia</HI> are very &s;afe;
in this I&s;land are the Rivers of <HI>Melipotame, Sca&s;in, Cladile,
Epi&s;idome, Giffo,</HI> and <HI>Divotro,</HI> towards the North <HI>Populiar,</HI>
towards the We&s;t <HI>Lymans,</HI> and to the South the Moun|tains
of note are <HI>Ida</HI> called by the inhabitants <HI>Philloriti
Luci,</HI> which <HI>Pliny</HI> calls <HI>Cadu&s;&s;i,</HI> and at this day <HI>Madure,</HI> and
<HI>Dacte,</HI> which they call <HI>Setrie.</HI> This I&s;land &s;eems to be
made to command all <HI>Greece,</HI> for that it lies not far from
<HI>Peloponne&s;us,</HI> and may command all the Sea towards <HI>Greece,</HI>
it was &s;old to the <HI>Venetians</HI> by the Marquis of <HI>Mont&s;errat</HI>
in the year, 1194.</P>
<P>This I&s;land of <HI>Candia,</HI> although it be hilly, yet it hath
many Valleys that are fruitful, and yield much, for that
they are watered with many Fountains, Brooks, and Rivers:
Moreover, there is abundance of excellent Wine, which
they of the Countrey call <HI>Malm&s;ey,</HI> they have &s;tore of Milk
and Honey, and &s;ufficient of fle&s;h, &s;o as they anciently did
call it, the happy I&s;land: There grows the goodlie&s;t Cy|pre&s;s
Trees that can be &s;een; and all other kinds of Timber
fit for the building of Ships. There is not any hurtful or
venemous Bea&s;ts except <HI>Phalanges,</HI> which are like unto Spi|ders,
but in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">andia</HI> they are not dangerous.</P>
<P>It abounds al&s;o in wild Goats, fallow Deer, and Y&s;ards,
or <HI>Chamo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> but there are few wild Bores, unle&s;s it be about
<HI>Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">a,</HI> there are al&s;o <HI>Bouce&s;lains</HI> called by the Latines <HI>Ibex,</HI>
they have long Horns like unto a wild Goat, and are not
much bigger, yet they have as much fle&s;h as a Stag, the hair
is fallow and &s;hort, but they carry a great black Beard; &s;ome|times
they take them, when they are very little, to breed
them up among&s;t their troops of Goats, and to have of
their race, as well for their beauty as for the ta&s;te of their
fle&s;h, his Horns are very great in re&s;pect of his Body, but
he is &s;o nimble as he out-runs any Stag, neither can the dogs
follow him by the &s;cent, for that he will wind the Hunt&s;men about a hundred paces off,
&s;o as when they would take him, they tie tame Goats upon the pa&s;&s;ages of the Mountain,
were the <HI>Bouce&s;laine</HI> &s;melling them, he goes unto them, and &s;taying there, the Hunt&s;men
have opportunity to &s;trike him, but if the wound be not mortal, although the Dart be poy|&s;on'd
and remains in his Body, yet he cures him&s;elf eating the Herb, which the Simpli&s;t calls
<HI>Dixamum,</HI> the which is good again&s;t poi&s;on, as <HI>Dio&s;cordies</HI> &s;aith, for that the only &s;cent of it
kills Serpents and other venomous Bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>This I&s;land did flouri&s;h in former times, when as her King did hold all <HI>Greece</HI> in awe, the
<HI>Cretoies</HI> were held the be&s;t Archers in the World, they invented the Pyrick Daunce, in the
time of their King <HI>Cydon,</HI> they were all armed when as they danced, and it hath been &s;o con|tinued
in this I&s;land, as the Pe&s;ants daunce on Holy-dayes in the hotte&s;t time of Summer,
not caring for any &s;hadow, and with their Arms, that is to &s;ay, a Bow, a Sheaf of Arrows,
and a Sword, as if without it they could have no good grace in dancing: The mo&s;t famous
Nations among the Grecians have taken their Laws from the Candiots, as <HI>Plato</HI> doth wit|ne&s;s,
e&s;pecially the <HI>Laced<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">monians,</HI> took their practice from them, they had one which did in|joyn
that all their children &s;hould be bred up in publick, to the end that the poor having the
like breeding to the rich, they &s;hall have no cau&s;e to envy them. And it was al&s;o ordained by the
Laws, that to inure their children not to fear any thing, but to bear all things with patience,
they &s;hould be accu&s;tomed to Arms; and to make them contemn heat, cold, hunger, and
thir&s;t, they &s;hould carry a Bow and Arrows in dancing, and their apparel &s;hould be &s;it for
War, all the Candiots were forced to marry, being of age, and then they were di&s;mi&s;s'd
from the company of young men: they did not pre&s;ently conduct their Wives home to their
Hou&s;es, but they attended until they wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">ble to manage the affairs of a Hou&s;hold, and Kin&s;|folks
married indifferently one with another. There was a Law, that if the brother did mar|ry
his &s;i&s;ter, he &s;hould make her a Dowry of half his Patrimony: To ravi&s;h a Maid was more
e&s;teemed, than if he had obtained his de&s;ire with free con&s;ent. In the end, Candiots lea|ving
their ancient Di&s;cipline, became Pirats, having been always powerful at Sea, and had
carried them&s;elves &s;o valiantly, as they had vanqui&s;hed them of <HI>Attica,</HI> and led Arms fortu|nately
into <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Candia</HI> are by nature apt and ready to do evil: the Ancients give them
the title of Lyers: They are &s;ubtil and courteous, and do hardly endure labour, neither do
they learn any Art or Science perfectly: It is true, that at this day, as <HI>Belonus</HI> &s;aith, they do
practice from their Youth, according to their ancient cu&s;tom, to &s;hoot, wherein they excel
even the Turks them&s;elves, and they are active and valiant at Sea, as much as they have been
in former times.</P>
<P>This City of <HI>Candia</HI> is exceeding &s;trong, both by Art and Scituation; The Turks being
po&s;&s;e&s;t of the whole I&s;land and Ma&s;ter of the field, attempted to win the <HI>Metropolis Candia</HI> al&s;o.
Therefore <HI>Anno</HI> 1648. he be&s;ieged it, and after many furi|ous
on&s;ets, being &s;till beaten, at la&s;t he was forced to give
over, but rai&s;ed another Town or new <HI>Candia</HI> at three
miles di&s;tance, which is the place of the Grand Vi&s;iers
Re&s;idence, by which means the City is blockt up by Land;
and now again the la&s;t year 1667. and this pre&s;ent 1668.
he lyeth before it, u&s;ing all the extremities po&s;&s;ible to win
it, and that he might the better effect it, the grand Vi&s;ier
has demoli&s;hed the afore mentioned Town that they built,
called new <HI>Candia,</HI> that &s;o his Souldiers might be the
more re&s;olute in the &s;iege, having no place for their re|treat.</P>
<P>This <HI>Candia</HI> is a large and famous City, &s;cituated on a
Plain by the Sea &s;ide, having a goodly Haven for Ships,
and a fair Ar&s;enal with 36. Gallies, it is very populous
and rich, inhabited partly by <HI>Venetians,</HI> and partly by the
natural <HI>Candians,</HI> it is exceeding &s;trong, and in Peace|time
daily guarded with 2000. Souldiers. The Women
wear breeches as men do, and boots after the &s;ame manner,
and their upper Coats no longer then the middle of their
Thighs; The better &s;ort of people go after the <HI>Veneti|an</HI>
fa&s;hion. <HI>Canea</HI> is the &s;econd City of this Realm, ex|ceeding
populous, well walled and fortified, equallizing
any &s;trength in <HI>Europe,</HI> it hath a large Ca&s;tle, where a
<HI>Venetian</HI> Sub-Governour doth re&s;ide; Then is <HI>Retimo,</HI>
this hath no Wall but a Ca&s;tle. The fourth is, <HI>Sithia</HI>
al&s;o head of a Province. The I&s;land of it &s;elf is inacce&s;|&s;ible
for &s;hips, but in the&s;e four Cities, and &s;ome few
other places well gauarded to hinder it. The Prin|cipal
Commodities of this I&s;land, are the Excellent
Wines, e&s;pecially the <HI>Malua&s;y,</HI> and the be&s;t Sugar in the
World, which we commonly call Sugar-Candy, then Cy|pre&s;s
wood, of which there are va&s;t Mountains full, which
they u&s;e for all things, Joyners and Carpenters work,
Timber for buildings, Ma&s;ts for Gallies, the re&s;t for fuel.
As for variety &amp; plenty of all &s;orts of excellent rare fruits,
it doth &s;urpa&s;s all other adjacent I&s;lands, e&s;pecially the
Valley of <HI>Suda,</HI> a &s;econd <HI>Paradi&s;e;</HI> the Grain is brought
from other parts; Of wild and hurtful bea&s;ts, as Lions,
Bears, Wolves, &amp;c. there is none; neither any venomous
Vermine, yet there is a &s;ort of Serpents, but their &s;ting
not hurtful, on the contrary their women are &s;aid to be &s;o
venemous, that being angry, if they &s;cratch or bite a man,
and &s;etch bloud, without pre&s;ent remedy he mu&s;t die. The
Natives are of the Grecian Church, except the <HI>Venetians</HI>
and &s;trangers.</P>
<P><HI>Anno</HI> 1645. The Turk unepectedly in Peace-time pick|ing
quarrel, landed 60000 men, and pre&s;ently be&s;ieged <HI>Ca|nea,</HI>
and before the <HI>Venetians</HI> could provide for defence,
he took that, and the whole I&s;land, except the City of
<HI>Candia,</HI> two or three other Forts, among who&s;e is that of
<HI>Suda,</HI> who&s;e Haven or Bay may receive at once above tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="OXF" EXTENT="1 letter">
thou&s;and Ships and Gallies, the re&s;t is all lo&s;t.</P>
