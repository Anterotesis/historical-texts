<HEAD>THE EPISTLE OF THE French Tran&s;lator, to all the Prote&s;tant Kings, Princes, and Potentates in the Chri&s;tian World.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mo&s;t excellent Princes,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT was my hap to contract amity with cer|taine Gentlemen of Arragon, and other Spaniards (not Ca&s;tillians, for to them I wot not how to carry any affection, which &s;hould exceede the pre&s;cript rule of the Go|&s;pell) of whom I vnder&s;tood many things t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">uching matters of State, which were to me &s;trange and vnknowne: by rea&s;on that there were among&s;t them &s;ome per&s;onages exceedingly well learned, and mo&s;t conuer&s;ant and expert in all Hi&s;tories, and notably well &s;eene and pra|cti&s;ed in the affaires of the World. There was one aboue the re&s;t in their company, a man of great &s;pirit iudgement, and experience who had &s;eene a great part of Europe, and (ha|uing beene for a long time in Portugall) had dealt and con|uer&s;ed with the Portugals, who&s;e Language he &s;pake natu|rally, and had read all the Hi&s;tories of that Realme, and was &s;o well acquainted with all their affaires, and knew them all
<PB REF="3"> &s;o particularly, that I did greatly wonder at it. For, in things that were to come, I found him in manner of a Prophet: in &s;o much that for the viuacity and quickne&s;&s;e of his &s;pirit, and the long experience which hee hath had, he &s;eemeth to me to haue as great knowledge in things to come, as if he &s;aw them pre&s;ent before his eyes. He made proofe vnto me by many rea&s;ons (which did not onely plainely conuince my opi|nion, but did as it were bind me hand and foote) that the&s;e voyages, and others of like kinde, would neuer draw with them any other profit, nor &s;erue to any other purpo&s;e, then to waken the &s;leeping dogge, and to re-enforce the common enemie. Now con&s;idering that <HI>Don Philip</HI> King of Ca&s;tile hath a Councell, the mo&s;t choi&s;e and excellent, &s;uch as neuer Prince in this World had a better, his &s;eruitors mo&s;t loyall and faithfull, great forces, and abundance of trea&s;ure, vpon the which all other things doe depend: and yet notwith|&s;tanding all this, hee doth not leaue daily to cau&s;e diuers Bookes to be imprinted in his fauour and defence, I doe therefore de&s;ire to haue drawne from this learned and wor|thy per&s;on &s;ome thing written with his owne hand, which I might pre&s;ent vnto your Maie&s;ties: and to this end did I diuers times make reque&s;t vnto him, but I could neuer get him to yeeld or conde&s;cend thereunto. Wherefore bethink|ing with my &s;elfe, that as pouerty, griefe, and melancho|lie, doth bury, and (as it were) kill the &s;pirits of a man, &s;o the commodities of this life, contentment and cheereful|ne&s;&s;e, doth reuiue and quicken them, I determined becau&s;e I &s;aw him &s;ad, pen&s;iue, and melancholicke, by rea&s;on of his exile and misfortunes out of his owne Countrey, to procure his plea&s;ure and contentment, knowing that by this meanes
<PB REF="3"> I might obtaine the accompli&s;hment of my de&s;ire, I did therefore &s;et open my gates and my Hou&s;e vnto him, I pre|&s;ented him with my Pur&s;e, and made him partner of my Coyne; I cheri&s;hed and entertained him for many dayes, and (for loue of him) &s;ome other of his company. And by this curte&s;ie I made him &s;o beholding to me, that afterwards hauing many times held di&s;pute and conference together, I cau&s;ed him in the end to take his Pen in hand. Thereupon did he compo&s;e in the Ca&s;tillian Tongue, this Di&s;cour&s;e, which he entitled <HI>Trattado paranaetico:</HI> and he pre&s;ented it vnto me. The which when I had read, a mo&s;t &s;trange ad|miration or a&s;toni&s;hment did raui&s;h me: for that I neuer &s;aw (I will not &s;ay in &s;o little a Volume) but not euen in great Bookes, &s;o many curio&s;ities reported, &s;o many and di|uers Hi&s;tories, things &s;o &s;ecret and particular, admoni&s;h|ments &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be embraced, nor coun&s;els &s;o iu&s;t to be followed. And knowing perfectly the excellency of this worke, and how greatly important it would be to be &s;eene of your Maie&s;ties, and by the Kings, Princes, Potentates, and Common-weales of Europe. And albeit I know my &s;tile to be rude and barbarous, yet &s;uch was my ambition (I con|fe&s;&s;e mine owne infirmity) that I was not willing that any other &s;hould haue the plea&s;ure in doing it. In &s;ome places I haue augmented it: holding it &s;o to be needfull, for the bet|ter and more cleere vnder&s;tanding of the Hi&s;tory. Touching the originall, I thought it rea&s;on not to abridge or cut off any part thereof. I mo&s;t humbly be&s;eech, in regard of your mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Maie&s;ties, to receiue it with that good af|fection, which Princes oweth to their Subiects: who for his &s;eruice, will not e&s;teeme to hazard the lo&s;&s;e of all that hee po&s;&s;e&s;&s;eth: much le&s;&s;e to make him&s;elfe vncapable for the
<PB REF="4"> obtaining of that which of right is due vnto him, and who for the good and honour of his Countrey, will &s;pend his life mo&s;t freely and willingly. God pre&s;erue and ble&s;&s;e the mo&s;t Chri&s;tian per&s;ons of your Maie&s;ties, with &s;o great abun|dance of &s;pirituall graces, and a&s;si&s;t you and make you to pro&s;per with &s;o many riches of temporall ble&s;sings, as is po&s;sible to his diuine Maie&s;tie. Amen.</P>

<HEAD>The Publi&s;her to the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>_FRiendly Reader, thou ha&s;t in this little Pamphlet an incomparable trea&s;ure, a rich &s;tore-hou&s;e and magazin full of pre|cious &s;peeches, true Hi&s;tories, rare ex|amples, liuely rea&s;ons, and whol&s;ome coun&s;els: the which if their Maie&s;ties, and the Kings, Princes, Potentates, and Common-weales of Chri&s;tendome would embrace, follow, and put in execution, without doubt they &s;hould &s;oone obtaine and find a medicine for &s;o many mi&s;chiefes, a remedy for &s;o great and continuall afflictions and intolle|rable trauels, wherewith their Subiects haue for &s;o many yeeres wra&s;tled and contended. And I dare a&s;&s;ure them, that by ob&s;eruing the adui&s;e here giuen them, they &s;hall pre|&s;erue their E&s;tates in time to come from all danger: for euen as the great fi&s;hes doe per&s;ecute and deuoure the &s;mall and little ones; &s;o in like manner tho&s;e neighbours which are mo&s;t mighty and pui&s;&s;ant, doe de&s;poile and con&s;ume the o|thers who are of le&s;&s;e pui&s;&s;ance. Now we know that there are two e&s;peciall rea&s;ons for which the Authour hath pro|longed and drawne out at length this his Di&s;cour&s;e, enrich|ing it with Hi&s;tories &s;o &s;ingular, and beautifying it with &s;uch rare authorities and examples. The former is: for that, as he hath endeuoured liuely to depaint vnto vs our enemy, and to make vs know the naturall di&s;po&s;ion of tho&s;e Nati|ons, of whom we haue great cau&s;e to take good heed; &s;eeing that all that which he hath &s;poken, doth &s;et forward this his intent and purpo&s;e, he &s;aw it would not be any inconueni|ence, to v&s;e therein &s;ome prolixity. If a man by compact, as
<PB REF="5"> bound thereto by another, or of his owne proper motion and free will, and vpon curio&s;ity, would vndertake a voyage of &s;ome three or foure leagues, not hauing any time prefixed nor limited for di&s;patch thereof, what harme would it be vnto him, if in his pa&s;&s;age he doe find &s;ome Gardens where he may recreate and refre&s;h him&s;elfe, from the trauell and weari&s;omene&s;&s;e of the way? So doe you my Ma&s;ters reade this Treati&s;e at your plea&s;ure, v&s;e it for your recreation, and take your delight in the &s;weete odours of her flowres and plea&s;ant po&s;ies. You neede make no great ha&s;t, there is no man that doth vrge you thereto. A &s;econd rea&s;on of the pro|lixity of this Treati&s;e, is, for that as the Author is driuen of nece&s;&s;ity to handle the vertues and the vices of diuers per|&s;ons and &s;undry Nations: &s;o his will was, that each of them &s;hould haue his due de&s;ert: the good and tho&s;e that haue done well, prai&s;e and honour; but the euill and vitious, blame and reprehen&s;ion. In the end of this Treati&s;e you &s;hall find the explication which he promi&s;eth, Fol. 143; in the which there are many things both of great curio&s;ity, and al&s;o as nece&s;&s;ary to the matter in hand as any of the re&s;t. For that in knowledge, vnder&s;tanding, and experience, hee doth farre exceed me, as his worke doth &s;hew apparantly. Touching the which briefly, I dare not affirme any thing, but this, that each word of his is a &s;entence, and that each &s;entence containeth many. I mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e, that to &s;ome per&s;ons in particular, his Treati&s;e will be ill accepted: but what remedy? he hath &s;poken but the truth, and what he affirmeth he proueth, and hee alledgeth nothing without his Authour to iu&s;tifie it. And truly I for my part am of this o|pinion: that it is not again&s;t rea&s;on, to publi&s;h the wicked|ne&s;&s;e and vices of &s;ome one particular per&s;on, which being true, may be made knowne to euery man, e&s;pecially when the knowledge thereof may redound to the great good and benefit of the weale publike. But to come to an end, let me entreat you to take in good part that which I haue &s;aid.</P>

But he &s;ayth he knoweth not what: for the Portugals are de&s;cended of the Gaules, the Celtes, and the Braccates, and their Language is almo&s;t the &s;ame with the Latine Tongue. But as touching the Ca&s;tillians, we cannot certainely &s;ay, from whence they are de&s;cended: Neuerthele&s;&s;e, the be&s;t iudgement and coniecture thereof, that can be made by circum&s;tances and euident proofes, is, that they are de&s;cended of the Vandals, of the Iewes, and of the Moores; and their Language is in a manner all one with that of the Moores, and their pronunciation is all one, or much alike. Thereof it commeth, that the Ca&s;tilli|ans being in the countrey of the Saracens, or of the Turkes, they doe &s;oone and very ea&s;ily denie the Chri&s;tian Faith, and doe turne altogether Turke and Infidell.

<P>In the yeare 1474. after the death of <HI>Henrie</HI> the fourth king of Ca&s;tile, <HI>J&s;abel</HI> the &s;i&s;ter, the wife of <HI>Fernand</HI> king of Arragon, did mo&s;t tyrannically get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Realmes of Ca&s;tile and Leon, and of their other Seignio|ries, excluding <HI>Jane</HI> the daughter of the &s;ayd <HI>Henrie</HI> her brother: who in the yeare 1461. had been acknowledged Prince&s;&s;e and inheritrix of the &s;aid Realmes, for default of heire males, in a full a&s;&s;embly of the three e&s;tates, which were a&s;&s;embled to that end at Madrill, by the commande|ment of her father. And the fir&s;t per&s;ons which tooke the oath of fidelitie, and did &s;o acknowledge her, were the in|fant <HI>Don Alpho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;us,</HI> and the &s;ayd <HI>I&s;abel,</HI> the brother and &s;i&s;ter of the &s;ayd king: after whom all the re&s;idue did the like, euery one in order according to their degrees.

<P>By that which hath beene &s;ayd, appeareth clearely, that the Realme of Ca&s;tile, in le&s;&s;e then 258. yeares hath beene tyrannized foure times, and that of Leon thrice, and all the other Realmes and Seigniories likewi&s;e, which are dependants of the &s;ame: the which the king <HI>Philip</HI> po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;eth euen at this pre&s;ent day by a mo&s;t vniu&s;t, wrongfull and tyrannicall title.</P>
<P>This al&s;o is one thing worthy to bee marked, and (which may be &s;eene by the hi&s;tories both of the &s;ame authours, and of diuers others) namely, that when there hath hap|pened any difference or di&s;agreement vpon the &s;ayd &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion, they which haue beene in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, haue al|together preuayled, and made their title, euen by the right of tho&s;e very parties whom they haue di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: which is the greate&s;t tyranny that can bee.

<P>So that herein may bee &s;eene mo&s;t apparantly, the no|table tyranny of the predece&s;&s;ors of the king Catholike now raigning: who, after they had for a while &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the right of others, to the intent them&s;elues might tyranize ouer tho&s;e Realmes: yet would afterwards &s;eeke againe to reuiue, and to retaine that very right, and title which they had before mo&s;t iniuriou&s;ly v&s;urped.

Which is the cau&s;e that all the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall and regular per&s;ons of Portugall doe hate him &s;o extremely, that when the commandement was giuen them, that in certaine of their prayers, and in their Canonicall houres, they &s;hould expre&s;&s;ely pronounce the name <HI>Philip</HI> (for the King knew well, that vnder the name of King v&s;ed indetermi|nately, they did in their hearts vnder&s;tand and pray for <HI>Don Anthonio.</HI>) They tooke his commandement in &s;o ill part, that they could not bee brought to doe it. But in the end they &s;eeing them&s;elues pre&s;&s;ed by the commandement of the Bi&s;hops and Prelates, they did at length pronounce his name, but with &s;uch di&s;daine and in dignitie, as I am a&s;hamed to &s;peake it: notwith&s;tanding becau&s;e the&s;e matters doe well concurre together, and it is not from

<P>The Archbi&s;hop of Lisbon hauing giuen out and pub|li&s;hed the Kings commandement afore mentioned, through out all the Churches of Lisbon, in the yeere 1582. the fir&s;t of Ianuary: vpon the day of the three Kings next en&s;uing, a certaine Curate, as he was &s;aying a &s;olemne Ma&s;&s;e in his Pari&s;h Church, with great pompe and &s;olemnity, and the Church full of people, when hee came to the end of the prayer which is v&s;ually &s;aid after <HI>Gloria in excel&s;is:</HI> in &s;ing|ing of the&s;e words, <HI>Et Famulum tuum regem no&s;trum</HI> (that is) thy &s;eruant our King; he &s;uddenly &s;topped, and turning him&s;elfe towards the Deacon and Subdeacon, he &s;pake vn|to them with loud voyce. Tell me, tell me, how call you this Diuell: And they an&s;wering him, <HI>Philip,</HI> he named <HI>Philip,</HI> and &s;o went on with his Ma&s;&s;e.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time it happened that a religious per&s;on of the order of S. <HI>Dominicke,</HI> making mention of the King in a certaine prayer, without naming him by his name of <HI>Phi|lip,</HI> and being commanded by his Prelate, vnder paine of contempt and di&s;obedience, that he &s;hould name him by his proper name: he then repeated it, &s;aying; <HI>Et Famulum tuum regem no&s;trum Philippum, Ducem Alben&s;em, Sanchum de Auila &amp; Rodericum Sapata, caeter&oacute;&s;que omnes diabolos, &amp;c.</HI> That is to &s;ay: And thy &s;eruant our King <HI>Philip,</HI> the Duke <HI>de Alua, Sancho de Auila,</HI> and <HI>Rodericke Sapata,</HI> and all the other Diuels. When I rehear&s;ed this vnto a No|bleman of good account, with whom I communicated the greate&s;t part of this di&s;cour&s;e, hee wondered greatly, v&s;ing this exclamation; Ie&s;u, doe the Prie&s;ts and Religious per|&s;ons of Portugall thus hate his Catholike Maie&s;ty? This is a &s;trange thing, and I maruell much that they hating him &s;o
<PB N="86" REF="50"> extreamely, and being of &s;uch &s;trength and pui&s;&s;ance in their Countrey, (for the mo&s;t part of them are Noblemen and Gentlemen, and &s;ome of them great Princes) that they doe not cau&s;e the people to ri&s;e in armes again&s;t that Ty|rant. I an&s;wered him, the cau&s;e is, for that albeit they haue neuer &s;o iu&s;t a cau&s;e to take armes, yet the Portugals are a people of great patience and &s;ufferance towards their Prince: and they doe al&s;o goe to the warres with &s;o ill a will, (howbeit, that being once in the warres, they proue very good Souldiers) that they had rather goe to hanging. Neuerthele&s;&s;e, if they &s;hould once ri&s;e again&s;t the Ca&s;tilian, they would defend them&s;elues in &s;uch manner, that hee &s;hould neuer more be able to &s;uppre&s;&s;e them.</P>
<P>The whole &s;ub&s;tance of the matter is: that they doe once grow to a re&s;olution, and that they &s;et hand to the worke: which if they once doe, I beleeue that they will make as great a wall betweene Portugall and Ca&s;tile, as they of China did in times pa&s;t make betweene them and the Tar|tarians: and if it were but onely to content the &s;oule of their King <HI>Iohn</HI> the &s;econd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Iohn</HI> the 2. the &s;courge of the Ca&s;tilians, named, The man and King of peace.</NOTE> named, <HI>The man and King of peace,</HI> who was the &s;courge and plague of the Ca&s;tilians: and of him is yet &s;poken that old prouerbe; <HI>Jf the Chicke had not come, the Cocke had beene taken.</HI> This Prince knowing the manners, the life, and the tyrannicall actions of the Ca&s;ti|lian, was wont to &s;ay, that hee did greatly de&s;ire to &s;ee be|tweene Portugall and Ca&s;tile,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The griefe and di&s;co~tentment of King <HI>Iohn</HI> the 2. of Por|tugall.</NOTE> a wall feared vp &s;o high, as might reach vp to Heauen; prote&s;ting, that the thing that mo&s;t grieued him in this World, was: for that the Sunne did fir&s;t pa&s;&s;e by Ca&s;tile, before it came into Portugall: and that which made him quite and cleane out of all patience, was, becau&s;e he knew not how to remedy it.</P>

<P>As touching the &s;econd: true it is, that <HI>Philip</HI> hath greatly aduaunced the Chri&s;tian faith in the We&s;t Indies: in &s;o much that this doeth &s;erue him greatly as a cloake or mantle to couer, and to augment his v&s;urped power and tyrannie: but this good worke ought to bee impu|ted to &s;uch deuout and religious per&s;ons, both of his &s;ubiects and others, as haue bene the in&s;truments there|of, rather then to him.

<P>Touching the third of your propo&s;itions: hi&s;tories doe well recount, and all men may a&s;&s;ure them&s;elues, how much hee loueth the Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall per&s;ons, and what re|uerence hee beareth to them that are religious. In times pa&s;t, it was neuer &s;eene, that any Eccle&s;ia&s;ticall or reli|gious per&s;on hath beene put to death in Spaine, for any matters concerning the e&s;tate. The greate&s;t crueltie, and mo&s;t rigorous &s;euere iu&s;tice, that the Arrian Princes &s;hewed vppon them for being contrarie to their opinions, was to impri&s;on them, and to keepe them enclo&s;ed with|in Mona&s;teries. True it is, that of &s;ome of them they did put out the eyes, and afterwards, &s;ome Princes did cau&s;e them to be put to death &s;ecretly in pri&s;on: but as for the gallowes, and &s;uch like infamous deaths, they knew not what it meant, &s;aue onely &s;ince the reigne of his Ma|ie&s;tie, that will be held for &s;o great and &s;o good a Catholike. And I for my part do beleeue, that he is no le&s;&s;e: and yet I know he is but a very bad Chri&s;tian: for I make no doubt but he beleeueth all that which the holy Catholike, Apo&s;to|like Romane Church our mother teacheth, and in&s;tructeth

<P>And as concerning the re&s;t of your allegations made in his excu&s;e; although that <HI>Philip</HI> hath builded vp a great number of Mona&s;teries, and many Churches, endowing them with rich reuenues, yet all this will not make me, but that I mu&s;t needes take him and acknowledge him for a no|table tyrant, and a mo&s;t cruell Prince.

Al&s;o they write of her, that &s;hee cau&s;ed a great number of Churches to be buil|ded, and did prouide them of &s;o great goods and riches, that it is a very &s;trange thing to be reported. See what <HI>Gaguin</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gaguin.</NOTE> writeth thereof: in &s;o much, that if a man would compare the charge and expences of <HI>Brunhault,</HI> with the meanes &s;hee had, he would greatly maruell, how this woman was able in one age to build &s;o many Temples, and a&s;&s;igne vnto them al&s;o &s;o good and large reuenues. Now <HI>Brunhault</HI> hath de&s;erued another manner of prai&s;e and commendation, for v&s;ing &s;o great liberality towards the Church, then doth <HI>Philip,</HI> becau&s;e &s;hee gaue of her owne, and <HI>Philip</HI> giueth of other mens.

But that was an occa&s;ion, that the practi&s;e brake off: be|&s;ides, that they were not well agreed among&s;t them&s;elues, whom they &s;hould choo&s;e to bee their chiefe and prote|ctour: &s;ome of them de&s;ired the Duke <HI>Ca&s;imier:</HI> others would haue England: and &s;ome others the Duke of Sauoy: who all that time did not know any thing at all of that
<PB N="106" REF="60"> which pa&s;&s;ed betweene him and the Mini&s;ters. But after that, at &s;uch time as the young Duke (now pre&s;ently ru|ling) came to &s;ucceed his Father, he being aduerti&s;ed there|of, &s;ent vnto the King of Nauarre, to demaund the Lady his &s;i&s;ter for his wife: one named <HI>Seruin</HI> was di&s;patched as the me&s;&s;enger to that effect, and after him a Vi&s;count; who &s;eeing great difficulty in the demaund, went by Bearne into Spaine, where he treated the mariage of the Infant <HI>D. Ka|therine,</HI> at this day Dutche&s;&s;e of Sauoy: which mariage <HI>Don Amadis</HI> the ba&s;tard brother of the &s;aid Duke after|wards effected. This mariage came well to purpo&s;e for <HI>Philip,</HI> becau&s;e by this meanes hee a&s;&s;ured him&s;elfe of the Duke, that he &s;hould attempt nothing in Portugall: where he knew full well, that after the death of King <HI>Henry,</HI> there was great diui&s;ion among&s;t the Portugals, for that &s;ome would haue had the Lady <HI>Katherine</HI> Dutche&s;&s;e of Bragan|cia: others the Lord <HI>Don Anthonio:</HI> and in a manner all well neere not liking to haue any of tho&s;e which were na|med, would haue had the &s;aid Duke of Sauoy, being the Graund-childe of a Daughter of Portugall, who (as the re|port is) if hee had gone thither during the inter-raigne in Portugall, at the time of that di&s;&s;ention, and by rea&s;on of their vnwillingne&s;&s;e to admit the one or the other of tho&s;e aboue named, he had without doubt beene receiued of all the Portugals.</P>
<P>To proceede, and to &s;hew you yet more plainely what manner of man this is, for who&s;e loue you doe euen &s;eeke your owne de&s;truction, and in who&s;e &s;eruice you are &s;o for|ward and &s;o diligent: I will adde here &s;omewhat more tou|ching this matter, for it is not po&s;&s;ible to vtter all that may be &s;poken to that effect. It is not long &s;ince, that for to fol|low the &s;teppes of &s;ome other good and godly Catholikes as him&s;elfe is, he rendered the City of Arzile to <HI>Muley Hamet</HI> King of Marocco, again&s;t the will and liking of the Portugals which did inhabit it, who had bound them|&s;elues without his aide to defend it. It was &s;uppo&s;ed by
<PB N="107" REF="60"> all the Chri&s;tians, that <HI>Philip</HI> &s;urrendered the City, becau&s;e hee was a&s;&s;ured that hee &s;hould not be able to defend it a|gain&s;t the pui&s;&s;ance of Infidels, for &s;o did he him&s;elfe cau&s;e it to be giuen out, &s;aying:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The rea&s;on why Philip rendred that City of Arzil to Muley Ha|met.</NOTE> That it was a le&s;&s;e mi&s;chiefe to render it without hazarding the liues and goods of the In|habitants, then by keeping it, to put them all in daunger. But therein hee abu&s;ed them mo&s;t maliciou&s;ly, for the true cau&s;e why this good Catholike rendered this City of Chri|&s;tians vnto the Moores, was becau&s;e he had promi&s;ed it vn|to their King, vpon condition he &s;hould not lend two hun|dred thou&s;and Crownes to <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> his cou&s;in ger|man, King of Portugall. The which &s;umme the Moore had before promi&s;ed to lend him at the interce&s;&s;ion of England: and for this rea&s;on had the &s;aid <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> &s;ent his &s;onne <HI>Don Chri&s;topher</HI> to Marocco to be there in ho&s;tage for the &s;aid &s;umme of money, who remained there by the &s;pace of foure yeeres. You &s;ee now what a good and Catholike Chri&s;tian deede this man did, whom you doe &s;o defend for a mo&s;t &s;ingular Chri&s;tian and Catholike, who to hinder a King, a farre better Catholike then him&s;elfe, from recoue|ring of his owne, doth not onely tyrannically detaine ano|thers right, but doth make it away from Chri&s;tians, to giue it vnto Infidels. What an&s;wer doe you make hereunto? I make your &s;elues the Iudges: wherefore then will you not acknowledge the irreligion of this man, to whom you are &s;o affectionate, and the great malice and peruer&s;ene&s;&s;e of him, whom you loue &s;o well? Con&s;ider and know, that you are taken and bound with a gro&s;&s;e chaine:<NOTE PLACE="marg">P&s;alme 41.</NOTE> and that <HI>abi&s;&s;us abi&s;&s;um inuocat:</HI> One depth calleth another. And I &s;ay to you, one fault draweth on an hundred thou&s;and after it. Of the maintaining and defending of an euill and wic|ked man, en&s;ueth commonly a &s;ini&s;ter and peruer&s;e iudgement of them which are good. This was well &s;eene to be true and verified in the life time of <HI>Don Antho|nio,</HI> and is yet &s;till euen at this day. It is a &s;hame to heare the abhominations which the fauourers of this
<PB N="108" REF="61"> pretended King Catholike haue heretofore &s;poken and gi|uen out, and doe not yet cea&s;e to &s;peake of this poore Prince decea&s;ed. Some call him rebell, others terme him a runni-gate, and a fugitiue from place to place, and from Countrey to Countrey: and &s;ome others call him a &s;editious per&s;on, an enemy to Chri&s;tendome, an Infidell, and an hereticke. Can there be any thing more grieuous, more &s;en&s;ible, more vniu&s;t, and more vnworthy of a Chri&s;tian? How dare you (again&s;t all Lawes both diuine and humane) handle and v&s;e &s;o ill, a Prince, the &s;onne of the greate&s;t Prince of his age: the graund-child of that great <HI>Emanuel,</HI> from whom the Princes of Europe doe glory to draw their de&s;cent and originall: a Prince &s;ore pre&s;&s;ed and turmoyled with afflicti|ons, trouble and perplexity. He hath well &s;hewed euen in his exile and bani&s;hment, that he was a better Catholike then your <HI>Philip</HI> his cou&s;in: le&s;&s;e ambitious, without chol|ler, without hatred, and full of charity. For if he would haue beene content to recouer his Realme of Portugall, with more honourable meanes then your tyrant hath tyrannized ouer it, and doth yet tyrannou&s;ly detaine it, hee might well haue done it. If he would haue accorded, that the Eng|li&s;h &s;hould haue had exerci&s;e of their Religion in Portugall, onely within their owne Hou&s;es and lodgings, the Earle of Leice&s;ter (whom &s;ome call the Count of Le&s;t) would haue vndertaken to &s;et him againe in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Realmes and Seigniories. In the yeere one thou&s;and fiue hundred eighty nine, when hee pa&s;&s;ed into Portugall with the Eng|li&s;h, among&s;t other Articles of agreement made betweene them, there was no other thing granted nor yeelded vnto them, but onely a licence or liberty for them to liue in Por|tugall, without being bound or compelled by the Eccle|&s;ia&s;ticall Prelates, to repaire to the Churches to the &s;eruice and exerci&s;e of the Catholikes. And in the &s;ame man|ner, as the Queene of England did then entertaine the &s;traungers Catholickes, inhabiting within her Realme of England: euen &s;o did hee accord and ordaine that the
<PB N="109" REF="61"> Engli&s;h &s;hould finde the like v&s;age and entertainement in Portugall. And it may be, that if he would haue enlarged their libertie in this re&s;pect, the Engli&s;h would againe haue enforced their aboade in that Countrey. But he proceeded &s;o like a Catholicke with them, that they had a kinde of di|&s;tru&s;t, and tooke occa&s;ion to &s;u&s;pect him. The king of Ma|rocco at this day now raigning, (of whom wee haue lately &s;poken) &s;ent an Emba&s;&s;adour into England, to intreat him, touching the deliuering of Portugall from her tyranny: of|fering him to make pre&s;ent payment of 100 thou&s;and Crownes at London, for the prouyding of 100 &s;ayle of &s;hipps to pa&s;&s;e into Barbary, from whence he promi&s;ed to embarke, and to pa&s;&s;e with him in per&s;on, and al&s;o to &s;et at liberty about &s;euen or eight thou&s;and Portugalls, whom he held in captiuity, and which were good &s;ouldiers, and with them and the principall hor&s;e of Barbary, to take land and &s;et foote in Spaine, and to put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Realme. But <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> would not accept tho&s;e his of|fers, becau&s;e hee would giue no occa&s;ion to the Moores, (namely tho&s;e Moores that are baptized and liue as Chri|&s;tians in Arragon, Valentia, Murcia,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cau&s;e why Don Antho|nio refu&s;ed the meanes to re|couer his Realme.</NOTE> and other quarters of Spaine, where the Moore did a&s;&s;ure him&s;elfe to finde 60 thou&s;and men at his deuotion) there to rebell, and to worke the mi&s;ery and calamity of the Chri&s;tians. This was a more daungerous matter, and would haue beene more burthen|&s;ome and chargeable to King <HI>Pbilip,</HI> then to the King <HI>Don Anthonio,</HI> with whome <HI>Muley Hamet</HI> de&s;ired to haue made a peace very beneficiall and aduantageous to the Realmes of Portugall: but <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> refu&s;ed all, onely mooued thereunto of a godly Catholicke zeale. Now &s;hew me (my Ma&s;ters) where or when your <HI>Don Philip</HI> euer did as much: He hath made great promi&s;es to <HI>Don Anthonio,</HI> to the in|tent he might cau&s;e him to renounce his right, which he had in Portugall, by rea&s;on of his election. He offered to make him Viceroy of Naples,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Offers of king Philip to Don Anthonio.</NOTE> with 400 thou&s;and Crownes of yearely rent, and the collation of the officers and benefices
<PB N="110" REF="62"> of that kingdome. Moreruer he would haue giuen him 500 thou&s;and Crownes to pay his debts, and to defray the charge of going to take that Gouernement vpon him: And that hee would bee bound to re&s;tore all tho&s;e Portugals to their former e&s;tates, who&s;e goods he had taken and con|fi&s;cated for following of his partie. And that hee would aduaunce and recompence &s;uch as did &s;erue and attend him actually: and that he would pardon all in generall. Whereunto <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> made him this aun&s;wer: God defend that he &s;hould commit &s;o great a fault:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Don Antho|nio full of con&s;cience.</NOTE> and that he had rather die in an ho&s;pitall, then to doe a thing &s;o hai|nous, wicked, vniu&s;t, and again&s;t his con&s;cience, for that the lawes had taught him thus much, that he might not contract for that which appertained to another. For, when he was cho&s;en at Sautaren, he had then &s;worne, and after|wards againe at Lisbon (when he was confirmed King by the deputies of the cities and townes of Portugall, which came thither to take their oath for their allegeance, and to doe him homage) that he &s;hould neuer accord nor fall to any agreement with the enemy, without leauing Portu|gall in her full and perfect libertie. This may &s;erue to &s;hew how much better a Catholike, and how le&s;&s;e ambitious the King <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> was then King <HI>Philip.</HI> And as tou|ching his choller and his hatred or charitie, that may ap|peare by this which followeth, in that there haue beene many men who haue oftentimes offered to <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> to kill <HI>Philip:</HI> neuerthele&s;&s;e he would neuer giue them any entertainment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mo&s;t chri&s;tian &s;peaches of D.

And who&s;oeuer &s;hall dare or ad|uenture to do it, let him looke to him&s;elfe that he come not into my hands. For though his &s;ins do &s;o blind and bewitch him, as that they make him &s;hew him&s;elfe a <HI>Saul</HI> again&s;t me
<PB N="111" REF="62"> yet I for my part do prote&s;t before God, to &s;hew my &s;elfe a <HI>Dauid</HI> towards him. A certaine man on a day demaunding of him a fauour for the good newes which hee brought him (for he had a&s;&s;ured him that King <HI>Philip</HI> was dead) he aun|&s;wered him halfe in choller; My good friend, doe&s;t thou not know who it is of whom thou &s;peake&s;t vnto me? hee is my cou&s;in germane, bring me newes that I haue eight or ten thou&s;and faithfull men, and well armed with good and &s;age Captaines, and all things nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;tore Portugall to libertie, and I promi&s;e thee in the word of an hone&s;t man, to make thee &s;o rich and &s;o honourable in my Realme, as no Gentleman &s;hall go beyond thee: go, go, learne to know the di&s;po&s;ition of Princes Now my ma&s;ters, what thinke you of the&s;e examples? do you now &s;ee what rea&s;on I haue to &s;ay, that the King <HI>Don Anthonio</HI> was more Catholike, and le&s;&s;e ambitious then the king <HI>Philip,</HI> &amp; that he was a man with|out choller &amp; hatred, but contrarywi&s;e full of charity? I pray you therefore for the loue of God, that from henceforth you would re&s;olue your &s;elues, with a &s;ound and vncorrupted iudgement, &amp; a pure con&s;cience, and without any inueigle|ment or indi&s;creet zeale, to embrace the good, and to reiect the euill. If he be di&s;hone&s;t, luxurious &amp; licentious, I &s;ay no|thing in that behalfe: for that is not the butt or ende of our treati&s;e: and I beleeue, that the Prince of Orange in his A|pologie, hath &s;aid &s;omething touching that matter: and the infamous rumour and dete&s;table report which hath runne, and doth yet runne throughout the world, doeth &s;ay much to that effect.
