<P><HI>GEntle Reader, This</HI> Pamphlet following, came by meanes of a friende to my hand, in <HI>Dutch</HI> lan|guage out of <HI>Holland</HI> from the City of <HI>Am&s;ter|dam,</HI> which when I had throughly peru&s;ed, I &s;uppo&s;e my labour could not be lo&s;t in tran&s;lating it into our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> tongue, becau&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> my Countrie-men, may vnder|&s;tand <HI>2.</HI> e&s;peciall con&s;iderations thereby: Fir&s;t the &s;mall gaine the <HI>Hollanders</HI> make by trading into the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies.</HI> Secondly the mi&s;&s;e-governement and iniurious dealing of the <HI>Maiors,</HI> and &s;uch as are appointed <HI>Governours</HI> for the trade of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> by the <HI>Hollanders.</HI> If the <HI>Maiors</HI> and <HI>Governours</HI> be tho&s;e, who Sub&s;titute vnder them <HI>Committies</HI> and <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> for the

<HEAD>THE RELATION FROM THE HOLLANDERS, AC|CORDING TO THE <HI>DVTCH COPPY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_WHereas at this pre&s;ent, there is much &s;peach, and may cen&s;ures, concerning the pro|fits and Government of the <HI>East Indie</HI> Com|pany, as well by the <HI>Maiors</HI> on their part, as by the <HI>Aduenturers</HI> on theirs, the one making boa&s;t of great profits; and to haue governed the &s;ame &s;o worthily as that they conceiue to haue
<PB N="2" REF="4">de&s;erved &s;till to continue and bee confir|med in their places. Other maintaining to the contrary, that neither the profit, nor the <HI>Maiors</HI> governement, to haue beene &s;uch, as that either pray&s;e or thankes is due to them; but that the Adventurers, haue rather iu&s;t cau&s;e to petition to the Lords the <HI>States</HI> Generall, for redre&s;&s;e of better ordering thereof in the now next intended Patent, that thereby the profits may be advanced and more increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>Now the better to explaine this my&s;te|rie, and diver&s;itie of opinions, wee will fir&s;t &s;et downe what hath beene the pro|fits, and next what hath beene the man|ner of governement, to the ende that e|uery man may iudge, what pray&s;e and thankes the <HI>Maiors</HI> haue de&s;erued.</P>
<P>As concerning the profits, fir&s;t is to be knowne, at what time the <HI>Adventurers</HI> did bring in and make up their Stocke, viz. in <HI>Annis.</HI> 1604. 1605. and 1606. which being receiued together faleth to bee in <HI>Anno.</HI> 1605&mdash;100. the Intere&s;t whereof rec|koned to the yeere 1622. which is for 17. yeeres after 6&frac14; <HI>per Cent. per An.</HI> with Intere&s;t
<PB N="3" REF="4">vpon Intere&s;t amounteth to little more or le&s;&s;e then &mdash;180.</P>
<P>Now con&s;idering the <HI>Maiors</HI> from the yeare 1604. to the yeare 1621. haue every yeare &s;ent from hence to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> a fleete to a certaine number of Ships, which are in all 18. fleetes of Ships, &s;ome|times more &s;ome times le&s;&s;e; which one with the other I reckon about halfe a ca|pitall: whereof the a&s;&s;urance &s;imply go|ing and comming amounteth to 24. <HI>per Cent.</HI> though more mu&s;t be given if one will en&s;ure the trade which pa&s;&s;eth from Port to Port in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> which du|ties for going and comming amounteth vnto &mdash; 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">6.</P>
<P>Hereof the Intere&s;t reckoned at 6&frac14; <HI>per Cent. per An.</HI> from <HI>Anno</HI> 1605. to the yeare 1621. vntill the money bee yearely payd, which amounteth with Intere&s;t vpon In|tere&s;t, to little more or le&s;&s;e then &mdash;199.</P>
<P>Whereby appeareth that the Capi|tall with the Intere&s;t and A&s;&s;urance a|mounteth vnto &mdash; 695.</P>
<P>Again&s;t this, is to bee reckoned what the Companie receiveth of the En&s;urers,
<PB N="4" REF="5">for lo&s;&s;e &s;u&s;tained by Sea as well in go|ing as comming, which ought to be va|lued as it co&s;t the Company here, which taken at the highe&s;t will hardly amount vnto 150. which being deducted out of the aboue &s;aid 695. the Capital commeth to &s;tand in with the Intere&s;t and a&s;&s;urance 5. Capitals, 45. <HI>per Cent.</HI> Now the <HI>Maior</HI> haue at &s;everall times delivered to the <HI>Ad|venturers:</HI> 2. Capitals, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

</LIST> Sum-200</P>
<P>From which the Intere&s;t being recko|ned to the yeare 1622. after 6&frac34; <HI>per Cent. Ann.</HI> with intere&s;t vpon intere&s;t which amounteth vnto &mdash; 117.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the Account or Adventure, pri&s;ed in March 1622. taken at the high|e&s;t is worth &mdash; 190</P>
<P>In Summe, the Capital with the pro|fits from the beginning vnto this pre&s;ent which the <HI>Adventurers</HI> haue receiued, 5. Ca|pitals. 7. <HI>per Cent.</HI> And the Capital com|meth
<PB N="5" REF="5">to &s;tand in here, with the intere&s;t and a&s;&s;urance, as aboue appeareth, 5. Capitals and 45. <HI>per Cent.</HI> So as the <HI>Adventurers</HI> haue gained nothing neere the &s;imple intere&s;t of 6&frac14; <HI>per Cent. per Ann.</HI> and ordinary a&s;&s;u|rance. By this may bee gathered what profits the <HI>Adventurers</HI> haue enioyed, and how thankefull they ought to be to the <HI>Maiors,</HI></P>
<P>Now as concerning the Governement, it is a thing certain that be it good or bad, the profits ari&s;e accordingly, for we dayly &s;ee and finde that by negligence all ill governme~t, a great e&s;tate is &s;oone brought to nought: and on the contrary through a good dilligent and provident governing, great gaines ari&s;e out of a &s;mall &s;tocke or meanes: whereas during all this Patent, &s;o little profit ari&s;eth, though great gaine is ordinarily to be made in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> &s;o as hereby may well be concluded that the &s;ame mu&s;t be &s;o, by rea&s;on of the di|recting or governing the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Now as concerning the well gover|ning: Fir&s;t of all is required a good vn|der&s;tanding and experience, which I per|&s;wade
<PB N="6" REF="6">&s;wade my &s;elfe hath beene and is in many of the <HI>Maiors</HI> without all doubt, but that is not enough, except there be care and diligence withall, but what care and dili|gence can be expected from them, who are &s;o continually imployed in their pub|licke Offices and functions, be&s;ides their particuler affaires, that they can &s;carce once or twi&s;e in a weeke, &s;pend a fewe houres in this waightie bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, which indeede hath need of a con&s;tant and con|tinuing &s;ale according as the greatne&s;&s;e and importancy thereof requireth.</P>
<P>For if a Marchant here in Towne, fin|deth &s;o much to doe in his private affaires, that to doe the &s;ame well, hee hath very &s;mall time be&s;ides to &s;pare: how much more time then doth &s;o great bu&s;ine&s;&s;e require? when not onely heere within the Land, but al&s;o in the <HI>Indies,</HI> in &s;o ma|ny farre remo~te partes, &s;o great in Trade is driven from Port to Port, and much more may be, were it well ordered: when vp|on any advi&s;e comming thence, good re|gard is to be had, as al&s;o good information to be taken from any committie or other
<PB N="7" REF="6">per&s;on comming thence, that &s;o thereby good advi&s;e may likewi&s;e been &s;ent backe from hence vpon &s;ure ground, and to &s;et|tle &s;o good an order for redre&s;&s;e of ought that is ami&s;&s;e there, that the Trade may flouri&s;h, and that tho&s;e places which the Company haue conquered there, may be to vs and our po&s;teritite in all obedience without preiudice. How great and con|tinuall a diligence this may require, and how little hath bin v&s;ed, tho&s;e that haue any vnder&s;tanding may ea&s;ily gather by the &s;mall profits, which haue bin made.</P>
<P>Further, is required in very <HI>Maior,</HI> that he by all meanes &s;eeke to procure the common good of that which is commit|ted to his charge, and not his particular: but how or wherein haue they hitherto fought the common good of the Compa|ny, &s;o long as they take a libertie to &s;ell the Companies goods vnto them&s;elues, in which &s;ale no doubt they &s;eeke their own particular profit, and not the Companies. At &s;ometimes one <HI>Maior</HI> buying the Com|panies goods of another <HI>Maior;</HI> and at an|other time it happeneth quite contrary,
<PB N="8" REF="7"><HI>viz.</HI> that he which was at fir&s;t the buyer, is now become the &s;eller to him that former|ly was the &s;eller him&s;elfe: one may well coniecture how the&s;e things are thus car|ried, by &s;uch, who it may be are not &s;o ho|ne&s;t as they &s;hould be; what hinderance hereby befalleth the <HI>Adventurers,</HI> and what profits to the <HI>Maiors,</HI> one may well coniec|ture by the &s;mall profits which the <HI>Adven|turers</HI> haue made, and the great wealth which the <HI>Maiors</HI> haue attained vnto.</P>
<P>When as the <HI>Maiors</HI> haue bought great quantitie of the Companies goods for them&s;elues, is to be imagined what kinde of advi&s;e they will &s;end to the <HI>Indies</HI> con|cerning &s;uch goods as them&s;elues haue bought, and whether their advi&s;e &s;hall not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">end to their particular profits.</P>
<P>Further may well be iudged, in what maner the <HI>Maiors</HI> &s;eeke to procure the pro|fit of the <HI>Adventurers,</HI> who make it a bu&s;ines to &s;ell their adventure for long dayes of payment, yea, oft-times more them&s;elues haue in the Companie, which is the cau&s;e that they may wi&s;h ill &s;ucce&s;&s;e to the Company, to the end that they may buy
<PB N="9" REF="7">it in, the better cheape again&s;t the time of payment befalleth, and &s;o to make their profit out of the Companies lo&s;&s;es: how much &s;uch <HI>Maiors</HI> doe affect that the Com|panie may pro&s;per, may be imagined?</P>
<P>And whether they haue not &s;ometime &s;et out great and vnnece&s;&s;ary Fleets (for many of them haue quite &s;ould at their adven|tures) whereby they could not be able to deliver out any &s;hares to the <HI>Adventurers:</HI> wherevnto notwith&s;tanding, the <HI>Maiors</HI> are by the <HI>Patent</HI> inioyned, &s;o often as 5 <HI>per centum,</HI> profits may be made. All which they doe to cau&s;e the adventure to fall in pri&s;e, to the end that they may buy it a|gaine good cheape. But what hinderance hereby is befallen many <HI>Adventurers,</HI> yea, &s;ome vtterly vndone, is too apparant, and they ought to examine their con&s;ciences, how free they are, and cleane herein. For might one perv&s;e their Bookes, no doubt thereby would be found, that many a|mong&s;t them haue little or no adventure) at all with the Company, and it would plainely appeare, that their provi&s;ion or factorie concernes them nearer then the
<PB N="10" REF="8">profit of the &s;tooke they haue there to ex&s;pect, and therefore doe readily re&s;olue to the &s;etting foorth of great &s;hipping or fleets, when as fewer and &s;maller would haue beene &s;ufficient for Conque&s;t, and fewer for trade from Port to Port: whereof that fleete which went through the &s;traight of <HI>Magellane</HI> was one, which fleete alone did charge the Com|pany with more then a Capital.</P>
<P>It is likewi&s;e the practi&s;e of the&s;e kinde of <HI>Maiors,</HI> (knowing the choyce to be in their own powers) to preferre their friends and kindred to the governement, and ex|cluding tho&s;e that are great Adventurers, take ofttimes &s;uch as are none, but &s;uch as when then &s;tand in nomination to be; doe then begin to buy conditionally &s;o they are cho&s;en, then their buying to &s;tand: but if not, then the bargaine to be voyd: what good &s;ervice the Company is to ex&s;pect by &s;uch nimbling may well bee coniectured. Be&s;ides they oft times preferre their friends, to be &s;ent as Com|mitties and other Offices to the <HI>Indies,</HI> although very vnfitt thereto, whereas it
<PB N="11" REF="8">highly concerneth the Company, to haue both hone&s;t and fitt per&s;ons there, for hardly can it be imagined the great wrong which the Company haue &s;u&s;tained, tho|row the having &s;o ba&s;ely vilde, &amp; proud|ly in&s;olent Committies in the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>Further, what lo&s;&s;e the Companie is put vnto, by the building of &s;o great and co&s;tly Shippes (each Chamber &s;triving which &s;hall make the greate&s;t Ship, and all for great &s;towage, to cau&s;e the grea|ter returne to be brought into their cham|ber, thereby to procure to them&s;elues the greater factorie or provi&s;ion) can|not well be imagined: for as well might it be done with le&s;&s;er, and Ships not &s;o co&s;tly, and &s;o the more &s;tocke to bee imployed in Trade, or otherwi&s;e to free them&s;elues of their intere&s;t money, which great Shipps, are partly v&s;ed to carry wood and &s;tone in the <HI>Indies,</HI> for the building of the Fort <HI>Iacatra,</HI> &s;ome being worne and &s;pent there, &s;o as indeed one might haue done as well betweene this and the <HI>Indies,</HI> with halfe as many great &s;hips.</P>
<PB N="12" REF="9">
<P>Al&s;o many Summes of Gold haue bin &s;pent in the making of divers co&s;tly Forts and Ca&s;tles in the <HI>Indies,</HI> the walles being all of &s;tone, being King-like workes, whereas to haue made them of Earth, as they are here in our Countrie the Nether|lands, had beene as v&s;efull for keeping the Trade, from other Committies of for|raine Lands: &s;o had this needeles charge beene imployed in Trade, might haue advanced the Company more then a Ca|pital.</P>
<P>Al&s;o the Companie hath freely indured &s;ome lo&s;&s;e, by rea&s;on of the complaint of tho&s;e per&s;ons who having done the Com|panie good &s;ervice, could obtaine little or no Salary for the &s;ame. Whereby is befal|len that &s;ome haue put them&s;elues into the &s;ervice of other Companies of forraine Lands, to the no &s;mall hinderance of this Companie, and by rea&s;on of their com|plaints, many other hone&s;t yong men haue beene di&s;couraged from comming into the Companies &s;ervice, whereas the ha|ving of good and &s;ufficient cour&s;es, doth very much import the Companie. For
<PB N="13" REF="9">which cau&s;e wi&s;e and provident Mer|chants doe both recompence and preferre their faithfull &s;ervants, to the end that thereby they may the longer make v&s;e of their good &s;ervice, which example &s;o the <HI>Maiors</HI> would imitate in requiting their faithfull &s;evants, and preferre &s;ome of them to the <HI>Maior&s;hip,</HI> it would doe the Company much good, for that they being well experimented in the cour&s;e of trade in the <HI>Indies,</HI> might &s;erue the <HI>Maiors</HI> (who were never there) vpon all occa&s;ions, with &s;ound and well grounded advi&s;e and di|rections, and this would be an induce|ment for other hone&s;t yong men to put them&s;elues into the Companies &s;ervice there, and being in hope of further pre|ferment, to performe it faithfully.</P>
<P>By the&s;e aboue-mentioned, and other rea&s;ons that may be annexed hereto, is ea&s;ie to iudge, whence it proceedeth that hitherto &s;o little profit hath beene made.</P>
<P>And that therefore the <HI>Adventurers</HI> as Petitioners, haue iu&s;t cau&s;e and rea&s;on to intreate the Lords the <HI>States,</HI> for better or|der
<PB N="14" REF="10">and Patent, and that they are not to bee blamed, as &s;ome haue gone about to doe.</P>
<P>For Conclu&s;ion; Con&s;idering the Trade to the <HI>Indies,</HI> doth &s;o much con|cerne the Land in generall, and the <HI>Ad|venturers</HI> each in his particular, to the end that through the well ordering there|of, it may not fall to the grounde, but &s;tand firme to vs, and to our po&s;teritie. It is not to be doubted, but that the Lords the <HI>States</HI> Generall, and the Prince his <HI>Ex|cellency,</HI> wil take this &s;o important a bu&s;ines to heart, and not onely be inclineable to the reque&s;t of the <HI>Adventurers,</HI> but add thereunto other more nece&s;|&s;ary points, &s;uch as they in their great Wi&s;edomes &s;hall find fit and nece&s;&s;arie.</P>
