<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis Day Landed &s;everal of my Acquaintance who left the County of <HI>Cork</HI> on the 24th of <HI>March,</HI> and give the following Particulars of the Late King <HI>James</HI>'s Landing and Reception there.</P>
<P>On the 12th of <HI>March</HI> entered the Harbor of <HI>Kin&s;ale</HI> 12 great Men of War with <HI>French</HI> Colours, 3 Fire&s;hips, 8 Merchantmen, and ca&s;t Anchor before the Fort. Soon after the Earl of <HI>Clancartie,</HI> who commanded in that place, having Notice of His Late Maje&s;ties being in the Fleet, gave Order to his Regiment to draw up ready to receive him, whil'&s;t he went on Board the <HI>St. Michael</HI> to Congratulate His Happy Arrival to that King|dom. In the Afternoon His Maje&s;ty Landed, and went up to the Fort, being accompanied by the Duke of <HI>Berwick,</HI> Mr. <HI>Fitz-James,</HI> the Mar|quis of <HI>Powis,</HI> the Earl <HI>Melfort,</HI> and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> who lay tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter"> Night in the Fort.</P>
<PB N="2" REF="2">
<P>Tho&s;e who came with His Maje&s;ty debarqued al&s;o at the &s;ame time, and went up to the Town, being to the Number of 150 Officers, which were all the Per&s;ons that embarqued at <HI>Bre&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>There His Maje&s;ty &s;tay'd till the 15th, in which time the Arms, Ammu|nition and Money were brought a&s;hore, and laid up in the Fort.</P>
<P>The Li&s;t of the Arms delivered at <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> amounted to 15000, together with 30000 Swords and Ammunition proportionable to the Service. There was al&s;o a 100000 <HI>l.</HI> in Money.</P>
<P>During His Maje&s;ties &s;tay here, Lieutenant General <HI>Maccartie,</HI> and &s;eve|ral <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Officers came to Congratulate His Arrival, and on the 15th, he went to <HI>Cork,</HI> and lay at <HI>St. Dominicks,</HI> being received by the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> after their rude and barbarous manner, by Bagpipes, Dancing, throwing their Mantles under his Hor&s;es Feet, making a Garland of a Cabbage Stump, and &s;uch like Expre&s;&s;ions of Joy.</P>
<P>During His &s;tay at <HI>Cork,</HI> Mr. <HI>Brady,</HI> the Mini&s;ter of the place, and Ten Men of <HI>Bandon</HI> petition'd Him for Pardon for that Town, which he granted, &s;aying, <HI>You may now &s;ee you have a Gracious King.</HI> And when the Earl of <HI>Clancartie,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Berwick</HI> urg'd the De&s;truction of that Ne&s;t of Rebels: To the fir&s;t he &s;aid, <HI>He was a Young Man.</HI> And to the latter, <HI>That he was a Fool.</HI></P>
<P>After that, came many of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> complaining of their barbarous U&s;age, and how all they had was taken. Whereupon He i&s;&s;ued out a Proclamation to quiet all, and that Re&s;titution might be made to them; which the <HI>Rabble</HI> (or <HI>Rapperies,</HI> as they call them) little regard|ing, continued plundering publickly every day, not &s;paring even their own Party: In&s;omuch that of Ten Oxen which were &s;ent the King as a Pre|&s;ent, Two of them were by tho&s;e Villains taken away.</P>
<P>Two Days after, notwith&s;tanding the King's Promi&s;e of Pardon to tho&s;e of <HI>Bandon,</HI> &s;everal were Indicted at the A&s;&s;izes, in&s;omuch that 30 or 40 of them fled by this Opportunity, and came to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> being frightned at the bloody Proceeding again&s;t one Mr. <HI>Brown,</HI> who was Hang'd, Drawn and Quartered at the &s;ame A&s;&s;izes.</P>
<P>Several Petitions were al&s;o preferr'd for the Pardon of Sir <HI>Thomas South|well,</HI> Capt. <HI>Mills,</HI> and many others, who being taken in their way to the <HI>North,</HI> were carried to <HI>Galloway,</HI> and there Try'd, and Condemn'd to dye: But the King rejected their Petition; however, reprieved them for three weeks, deferring it till His Arrival at <HI>Dublin,</HI> to which place <HI>He</HI> &s;et for|ward on the 21&s;t in the morning.</P>
<P>This, Sir, is what's confirmed by all Per&s;ons come over, who were Eye-Witne&s;&s;es of all that is here related; and who farther add, that mo&s;t of the <HI>French</HI> Ships &s;et Sail back again on the 17th for <HI>Bre&s;t.</HI></P>
<CLOSER><SALUTE>I am, Sir,</SALUTE> <SIGNED>Yours.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
