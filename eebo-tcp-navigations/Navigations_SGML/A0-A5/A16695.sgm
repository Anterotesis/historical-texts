And than &s;aynt Brandon told to them that this was a parte of hell / &amp; therfore he char|ged them to be &s;tedfa&s;te in the fayth For they &s;holde yet &s;e many a dredefull place or they came home agayne / &amp; than came the &s;outh wynde &amp; droue theym ferther in to the north where they &s;awe an hylle all of fyre / &amp; a foule &s;moke &amp; &s;tenche comynge fro thens / &amp; the fyre &s;tode on eche &s;yde of the hyll lyke a wal all brennynge and than one of his monkes began to crye &amp; wepe full &s;ore &amp; &s;ayd that his ende was comen &amp; y^t he myght abyde no len|ger in the &s;hyppe / and anone he lepte out of the &s;hyppe into the &s;ee &amp; than he cryed and rored full pyteou&s;ly cur+&s;ynge the tyme that he was borne &amp; al&s;o fader &amp; moder that begate hym bycau&s;e they &s;awe no better to his cor+reccyon in his yonge age. For now I mu&s;t go to perpe+tuall payne. And than the &s;ayenge of &s;aynt Brandon
<PB REF="8"> was verefyed that he &s;ayd to hym wha~ he entred / ther+fore it is good a man to do penaunce &amp; for&s;ake &s;ynne for the hour of deth is incertayn And than anone the wyn+de tourned in to the northe &amp; droue the &s;hyppe in to the &s;outh whiche &s;ayled &s;euen dayes co~tynually. And than they came to grete a rocke &s;tondynge in the &s;ee / &amp; theron &s;ate a naked man in full great my&s;erye and payne. For the wawes of the &s;ee had &s;o beten his body that all the fle&s;&s;he was gone of / and no thynge lefte but &s;ynewes &amp; bare bones. And whan the wawes were gone / there was a canuas that hynge ouer his heed whiche bette his body full &s;ore with the blowynge of the wynde. And al&s;o there were two oxe tonges / and a great &s;tone that he &s;ate vpon the whiche dyd to hym full great ea&s;e And than &s;aynt Brandon charged hym for to tell hym what he was. And he &s;ayd my name is Iudas y^t &s;oll+de our lorde Ihe&s;u cry&s;te for .xxx. pens whiche &s;ytteth here &s;oo wretchedly / how be it I am worthy to be in the grete&s;t payne that is. But our lorde is &s;o mercyful that he hath rewarded me better tha~ I haue de&s;erued For of ryght my place is in the brennynge fyre of helle. But I am here but certayne tymes of the yere that is fro cry&s;tma&s;&s;e to twelfth daye and fro ee&s;ter to wyt&s;on tyde be pa&s;te and euery fee&s;tfull daye of our lady &amp; eue|ry &s;aterdaye at none tyll &s;ondaye that euen&s;onge be do|ne but all other tymes I lye &s;tyll in hell in full brennyn+ge fyre with Pilate / Herode &amp; Cayphas therfore accur+&s;ed be the tyme that euer I knewe them And than Iu+das prayed &s;aynt Brandon for to abyde &s;tyll there all that nyghte / and that he wolde kepe hym &s;tyll that the fendes &s;holde not fetche hym to hell. And than he &s;ayd to hym with goddes grace / thou &s;halte abyde here all this nyght And than he a&s;ked. Iudas what cloth that
<PB REF="8"> was that henge ouer his heed &amp; he &s;ayd it was a clothe that he gaue vnto a lepre / whiche was bought with the money that he &s;tale fro our lorde whan I bare his pur&s;e / wherfore it dooth to me full great payne now in betynge my face with the blowynge of the wynde. And the&s;e two oxe tonges that ha~ge here aboue me I gaue them &s;omtyme to two pree&s;tes to praye for me / them I bought with myn owne money / &amp; therfore they ea&s;e me bycau&s;e the fy&s;&s;hes of the &s;ee gnawe on the~ &amp; &s;pare me And this &s;tone that I &s;yt on laye &s;omtyme in a de&s;olate place / where it ea&s;ed noo man / and I toke it thens and layde it in a foule waye where it dydde moche ea&s;e vnto them that wente by that waye. And therfore it ea&s;eth me now / for euery good dede &s;hal be rewarded &amp; euery euyll dede &s;halbe puny&s;&s;hed. And on the &s;onday ayen&s;t euen there came a great multytude of fendes bla&s;tynge and rorynge / &amp; they bad &s;aynt Brandon goo thens that they myghte haue theyr &s;eruaunte Iudas / for we dare not come in the pre&s;ence of our may&s;ter but yf we bryn|ge hym to hell with vs. And than &s;ayd &s;aynt Brandon I lette not you to do your may&s;ters commaundement but by the power of our lorde Ihe&s;u I charge you to le+ue hym this nyghte tyll to morowe. How dare&s;t thou helpe hym that &s;olde his may&s;ter for .xxx. pens vnto y^e Iewes / and cau&s;ed hym al&s;o to dye y^e moo&s;t &s;hamefull deth vpon the cro&s;&s;e.

And after &s;aynt Bra~|don &s;ayled &s;outh warde thre dayes &amp; thre nyghtes &amp; on the fryday they &s;awe an ylonde. And than &s;aynt Bran|don began to &s;ynge &amp; &s;ayd I &s;e y^e ylonde wherin &s;aynt Poule the heremyte dwelleth &amp; hath dwelled there .xl. yere without mete &amp; drynke ordyned by mannes hon+de / &amp; they came to the londe &s;aynt Poule came &amp; welco+med them humbly he was olde &amp; forgrowen &s;o that no man myght &s;e his body Of whome &s;aynt Bra~don &s;ayd wenynge / now I &s;e a man that lyueth more lyke an au~+gell than a man / wherfore we wretches may be a&s;ha|med that we lyue no better.

And than I left the &s;hyppe &amp; wente to londe and
