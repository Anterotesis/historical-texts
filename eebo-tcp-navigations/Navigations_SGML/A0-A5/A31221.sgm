<HEAD>TO THE
MOST HIGH
AND HONOVRABLE
Court of PARLIAMENT, now
Assembled.
The humble Petition of WILLIAM CASTELL,
Parson of Courtenhall in Northamptonshire, for the
propogating of the Gospell in America.</HEAD>
<P>_IN all humble manner, sheweth unto your appro|ved
wisdomes, the great and generall neglect of
this Kingdome, in not propagating the glorious
Gospell in <HI>America,</HI> a maine part of the World:
Indeed the undertaking of the work is (in the ge|nerall)
acknowledged pious and charitable; but the small pro|secution
that hath hitherto been made of it, either by us or others,
having (as yet) never been generally undertaken in pitty to mens
soules, but in hope to possesse the Land of those Infidels, or of
gaine by Commerce, may well make this and all other Christi|an
Kingdomes confesse, they have been exceeding remisse, in
performing this so religious, so great, so necessary a worke.</P>
<P>May it therefore please your wisdomes, to give your <HI>Petitioner</HI>
leave to propose briefly, (as the nature of a Petition requireth)
the more then ordinary piety and charity of the worke; the evi|dent
necessity, and benefit of undertaking, together with the
easinesse of effecting.</P>
<P>A greater expression of piety (your <HI>Petitioner</HI> conceiveth)
there cannot be, then to make God knowne where he was never
spoken nor thought of, to advance the Scepter of Christs King|dome.
<PB N="2" REF="4">
And now againe to reduce those, who (at first) were
created after the Image of God from the manifest worship of
Devils, to acknowledge and adore the blessed Trinity in Unity.
To do this, is to be happy instruments of effecting those often
repeated promises of God, in making all Nations blessed by the
comming of Christ, and by sending his Word to all Lands: It is
to inlarge greatly the pale of the Church. And to make those
(who were the most detestable Synagogues of Sathan) delight|full
Temples of the Holy Ghost.</P>
<P>It was a high point of piety in the Queen of the South, to
come from the utmost parts of the world to heare the wisdome
of <HI>Salomon.</HI> And so it was in <HI>Abraham,</HI> to leave his native
countrey for the better, and more free service of his God.</P>
<P>And certainly it will be esteemed no lesse in those, who (either
in their persons or purses) shall religiously endeavour to make
millions of those silly seduced <HI>Americans,</HI> to heare, understand,
and practise, the mysterie of godlinesse.</P>
<P>And as is the piety, such is the charity of the work, exceeding
great, to no lesse then the immortall soules of innumerable men,
who still sit in darknesse, and in the shadow of death, continual|ly
assaulted and devoured by the Dragon, whose greatest de|light
is to bring others with himselfe into the same irrecoverable
gulfe of perdition. What those blinde and spirituall distressed
<HI>Americans</HI> are, we were, and so had continued, had not Apo|stolicall
men afforded greater charity unto us, <HI>Divisis orbe Bri|tannis,</HI>
by long journeying; and not without great hazzard of
their lives, then (as yet) hath been shewed by us unto them.</P>
<P>We are not indeed indued with such eminent extraordinary
gifts, as were the Primitive Christians; but yet (if it be duly
considered) how fully and how purely God hath imparted his
Gospell unto this Island; how miraculously he hath lately pro|tected
us from Spannish Invasions, and Popish Conspiracies;
how (at this time) we abound in shipping, and all manner of
provision for Sea: It will be found, that we (of all Nations) are
most for the work, and most ingaged to do it in due thankful|nesse
to God.</P>
<P>Nor is the arms of the Lord shortned, or his wonted bounty
so restrained; but that undertaking the Voyage principally for
<PB N="3" REF="4">
Gods glory, and in compassion to mens soules, we may expect
a more then an ordinary blessing from him, whose usuall custome
is to honour those that honour him, and most abundantly even
in this life, to recompence such religious undertakings.</P>
<P>The Spaniard boasteth much of what he hath already done in
this kinde; but their own Authors report their unchristian be|haviour;
especially their monstrous cruelties to be such, as they
caused the Infidels to detest the name of Christ. Your wisdomes
may judge of the Lion by his claw. In one of their Islands cal|led
<HI>Hispaniola</HI> of 2000000 of men, as <HI>Benzo</HI> (in his Italian Hi|story)
affirmeth, they had not left 150 soules. And <HI>Lipsius</HI> just|ly
complaineth, that wheresoever they came, they cut downe
men as they did corn without any compassion. And as for those
that survived, they bought their lives at deare rates: for they put
them to beare their carriages from place to place; and if they
failed by the way, they either miserably dismembred, or killed
them out-right. They lodged them like bruit beasts under the
planks of their ships, till their flesh rotted from their backs:
And if any failed in the full performance of his daily task, he was
sure to be whipped till his body distilled with goar blood, and
then poured they in either molten pitch or scalding oyle to sup|ple
him.</P>
<P>A very strange and unlikely way to work Infidels unto the
faith, neither yet could they (if they would) impart unto others
the Gospell in the truth and purity thereof, who have it not
themselves, but very corruptly, accompanied with many idle,
absurd, idolatrous Inventions of their owne, which are but as
so many superstructures wickedly oppressing, if not utterly sub|verting
the very foundations of Christianity.</P>
<P>And although some of the reformed religion, <HI>English, Scotch,
French,</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> have already taken up their habitations in
those parts, yet hath their going thither (as yet) beene to small
purpose, for the converting of those nations, either for that they
have placed themselves but in the skirts of <HI>America,</HI> where
there are but few natives (as those of New <HI>England,</HI> or else for
want of able and conscionable Ministers (as in <HI>Virginia</HI>) they
themselves are become exceeding rude, more likely to turn He|then,
then to turn others to the Christian faith.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="5">Besides, there is little or no hope our plantations there, should
be of any long continuance, since here in England for some years
last past, they have been rather diversly hindered then any wayes
furthered, how and by whom, your wisdomes either have, or
will shortly find out: but this is evident, that the proud super|stitious
Spaniard (who hateth their religion, and feareth their
neighborhood, will spare them no longer then (to his over-swel|ling
greatnesse) shall seeme good: And in the judgement of most
judicious Travellers that way, they may (if they will) easily
enough suppresse and destroy all other our Plantations, as they
did of late that of Saint <HI>Christophers,</HI> when they were no way
provoked by us, as they will now pretend they are by a latter
taking of <HI>Trinidado,</HI> and the losse of more then 150 of their men
there. At least they will be sure to be desperately assaulted, as
was the Isle of <HI>Providence,</HI> but the year last past.</P>
<P>Whence your Petitioner offereth unto your Honourable con|siderations
a third Argument (drawn from meer necessity) that
as you tender the happy proceeding of those (as yet) but weakly
setled Plantations: the liberties, livelyhood, and lives, of many
thousands our deare brethren and countrey men: and which is
yet more the prosperous progresse of the Gospell, you would be
pleased to consult of such an able and speedy supply, as may se|cure
them against the now expected cruelty of the Spaniard.</P>
<P>To which needfull supply, the better and sooner to induce
your wisdomes, your Petitioner desireth your yet a little further
patience untill he hath shewed some temporall benefits that are
thereby like to accrew unto this kingdome, together with the
easinesse of effecting.</P>
<P>When a kingdome beginneth to be overburthened with a mul|titude
of people (as <HI>England</HI> &amp; <HI>Scotland</HI> now do) to have a con|venient
place where to send forth Colonies is no small benefit:
And such are the North-East and North-West parts of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI>
between the degrees of 25 and 45 of the North latitude,
which at this time do even offer themselves unto us, to be pro|tected
by us, against the known cruelty of the over near ap|proaching
Spaniard.</P>
<P>A very large tract of ground containing spacious, healthfull,
pleasant, and fruitfull countries, not only apt, but already provi|ded
of all things necessary for mans sustentation, Corne, Grasse,
<PB N="5" REF="5">
and wholesome Cattell in good competency: but fish, fowle,
fruits, and herbs in abuddant variety.</P>
<P>If we should look no further then the South of <HI>Virginia,</HI> (which
is our owne) wee shall finde there all manner of provision for
life: besides Merchantable Commodities, Silke, Vines, Cot|ton,
Tobacco, Deere-skinnes, Goat-skinnes, rich Furre, and
Beavers good store, Timber, Brasse, Iron, Pitch, Tarre, Rosin,
and almost all things necessary for shipping, which if they shall
be employed that way; they who are sent away may (with
Gods blessing) within short time in due recompence of their set|ting
forth, returne this kingdome store of silver and gold, pearls,
and precious stones; for undoubtedly (if there be not a generall
mistake in all Authors, who have written of these places) such
treasure is to be had; if not there, yet in places not farre remote,
where (as yet the Spaniard hath nothing to do.) And in case the
Spaniard will be troublesome to our Plantations, or shall (as it
is generally conceived) be found an enemy to this kingdome,
there is no way more likely to secure England, then by having
a strong Navie there; hereby we may come to share, if not ut|terly
to defeat him of that vaste Indian Treasure, wherewith he
setteth on fire so great a part of the Christian world, corrupteth
many Councellors of state, supporteth the Papacy and general|ly
perplexeth all reformed Churches.</P>
<P>Nor need any scrupulous <HI>quere</HI> be made, whether we may not
assault an enemy in any place, or not esteeme them such as shall
assault us in those places, where we have as much to do as they.
The Spaniard claimeth indeed an Interest, little l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sse than here|ditary
in almost all <HI>America,</HI> and the <HI>West Indies,</HI> but it is but by
vertue of the Popes grant, which is nothing worth, as was long
since determined by Queene <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> and her Councell; so as
for the Spaniard to debarre us in the liberty of our Plantations, or
freedome of commerce in those spacious Countries, were over
proudly to take upon him; and for us to permit it were over|much
to yeeld of our own right.</P>
<P>Especially, when we may, as now we may, so easily help our
selves: For your Petitioner conceiveth there is no great difficul|ty
in the preparation here, or tediousnesse in the passage thither,
or hazard when wee come there. The preparation of men and
shipping, in respect of the daily happy expected accord between
us and the <HI>Scots,</HI> is (upon the matter) already made. And as for
<PB N="6" REF="6">
money it is in the power of this Honourable House to give suffi|cient,
without any grievance, or dislike of the Common-wealth,
who (undoubtedly) in the generall will think nothing grievous,
which shall be concluded by your wisdomes, expedient to such a
pious and charitable worke.</P>
<P>And as for the passage, how can it be thought either tedious or
dangerous, it being ordinarily but six weeks saile, in a sea much
more secure from Pirats, and much more free from shipwrack,
and enemies coasts, than our ten or twelve moneths voyage into
the <HI>East-Indies.</HI> And as for our good successe there, we need not
feare it. The natives being now every where more than ever, out
of an inveterate hatred to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> ready and glad to enter|taine us. Our best friends the <HI>Netherlanders</HI> being with eigth and
twenty ships gone before to assist and further us. And which is
much more, our going with a generall consent in Gods cause, for
the promoting of the Gospell, and inlarging of his Church, may
assure us of a more than ordinary protection and direction. That
hitherto we have been lesse successefull in our voyages that way,
we way justly impute it to this, that as yet they have not been
undertaken with such a generall consent, and with such a full re|ference
to Gods glory as was requisite.</P>
<P>And so your Petitioner having delivered his apprehension here|in
more briefely, than so weighty a matter might well require,
he submits all the premises to your more full deliberation and
conclusion, which he humbly prayeth, may be with all conve|nient
speed; the only best way under God to make it the better
successefull.</P>
<P>WEE whose names are here under-written, having been
upon occasion acquainted with a motion intended to be
made by Master <HI>William Castell,</HI> Parson of <HI>Courtenhall</HI> in the
County of <HI>Northampton,</HI> to the High and Honourable Court of
Parliament now assembled, concerning the propagation of the
glorious Gospell of Christ in <HI>America.</HI> As we do well approve
of the motion; so we do humbly desire his reasons may be duly
considered: And so good a work furthered their wiser judge|ments
may resolve upon, to which we humbly submit the same.

<P>For to my <HI>understanding,</HI> there was never propound|in

<P>As we are an <HI>Iland,</HI> it concernes our being to have

be carryed out of the <HI>Kingdtme,</HI> but laid out for <HI>ship|peng,</HI>
which is the <HI>defence</HI> of it, and bestowed upon our

whatsoever benefit, <HI>Plantation, Traffick,</HI> or <HI>Purchase</HI> can

<P>Now, let us a little consider the <HI>Enemy</HI> we are to en|counter,
the King of <HI>Spain.</HI> They are not his great <HI>Ter|ritories</HI>
which make him so <HI>powerfull,</HI> and so troublesome

it selfe is but weak in <HI>men,</HI> and barren of <HI>Naturall Com|modities.</HI> As for his other <HI>Territories,</HI> they lye <HI>divided</HI>

they are held by <HI>force,</HI> and <HI>maintained</HI> at an extraordina|ry

<HEAD>AN INTRODVCTION
To the
WORKE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE West-Indies as usually knowne by the name
of <HI>America,</HI> were first found out by <HI>Christopher
Columbus,</HI> in the yeare 1493. at the expence of
<HI>Ferdinand</HI> King of <HI>Castile;</HI> much furthered by
<HI>Isabella</HI> his Queen, who Pawned all her Jewels to
advance the Christian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aith, and to augment the revenu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> of that
Crowne. A worthy Princely act, as highly to be commended
as the late pawning of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">wels of the English Crowne, is
justly to be condemned for the suppressing of the Gospell in the
purity of it, and the exceeding weakning, if not utter ruining
both of King and Kingdome.</P>
<P>But though this <HI>New World</HI> (for so it may be justly styled, as
being of a vast extent, much larger than <HI>Asia,</HI> and never heard of
before) was first thought of, and in three voyages (not without
divine inspiration and assistance) discovered by that worthy <HI>Co|lumbus;</HI>
yet one <HI>Americus,</HI> who after made a more full disco|very,
hath been honour<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">d with the name of it. This goodly
Countrey was first proffered to one of our Kings, <HI>Henry</HI> the se|venth,
a very wise Prince, who yet unhappily refused to be at
any charge in the discovery; supposing the learned <HI>Columbus</HI>
to build Castles in the ayre: but the motion being afterwards
entertained by the said King <HI>Ferdinand; Castile,</HI> (the least of the
three Kingdomes of <HI>Spain)</HI> became Commander of them all,
and by re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">son of the incredible treasure yearely brought from
thence, his successors are now become formidable to all Chri|stiane
<PB N="10" REF="12">
Nations, ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> are designed by the Jesuits (the Popes grand
Enginiers) to be the sole absolute Monarckes of all <HI>Christendom,</HI>
A plot yet to bee prevented, by our King and State, if timely
thought upon, in sending forth a considerable Navy, whereby
we may best suppresse the <HI>Spaniards</HI> overswelling greatnesse, and
the most subtill designes of Jesuits, who have bewitched no in|considerable
number of seeming Protestants here to beleeve, that
the King and Grandees of <HI>Spaine,</HI> intend good to this Kingdom,
it being most apparent, that that <HI>Indian</HI> treasure by them dispo|sed;
first raised, and still foments these never sufficiently to be
deplored combustions in <HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I shall say nothing of the causes, that moved <HI>Columbus</HI> to un|dertake
this strange voyage, nor yet how it came to be first in|habited,
as being by many, esp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">cially by <HI>Acosta</HI> so fully re|lated.</P>
<P>Thus much in generall is nec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ssarily to be observed, that in re|spect
of latitude, it is extended well nigh from the South to the
North-pole. It hath to the East <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> from which it
is divided by the wide <HI>German</HI> and <HI>Atlanticke</HI> Sea, sometimes
by more, sometimes by lesse distance of leagues, nearer to <HI>Afri|ca</HI>
than <HI>Europa.</HI> To the West it hath <HI>Asia,</HI> and those Southerne
parts of the world, as yet remaining to be discovered, how large
the Sea is that divides <HI>America</HI> from <HI>Asia,</HI> is as little knowne,
some are of opinion that it is but a narrow Sea, but it is more pro|bable
to prove very wide.</P>
<P>The forme of this spacious Country is irregular in respect of
its many turnings and windings, putting out and taking in a|gaine
both by sea and land, The North part of it hath a Medi|terranean
Sea, wherein lye those great Islands, <HI>Portu-Rico, Hi|spaniola,
Iamaica</HI> and <HI>Cuba,</HI> every way comparable to <HI>England,</HI>
were it not for the more constant temperature of this our incom|parable
Climate. There are likewise at least a thousand lesser
Islands, all lying within this Mediterranean Sea, which make
many parts of the Continent of this Northe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ne <HI>America</HI> to be
farre distant one from another, in regard either of longitude or
latitude, <HI>New-found-Land,</HI> the most North-east part as ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> dis|covered,
is distant from the most North-west parts of <HI>Calfor|nia</HI>
(which are likewise the farthest) as yet discovered, full 90
<PB N="11" REF="12">
degrees amounting to 1800 league, either of them by little and
little drawing nearer the one to the other, untill they come with|in
a degree and an halfe of the <HI>Tropick</HI> of <HI>Cancer:</HI> and then from
the most southerne part of <HI>Florida</HI> to <HI>Cullacan</HI> bordering upon
the South-west seas of <HI>Nova Hispania,</HI> (which differ not much
in latitude) the longitude both by sea and land doth not exceed
above thirty degrees. And afterwards in some places more, in
others lesse; this North <HI>America</HI> in a great disproportion falleth
to the Equinoctiall, where from the most E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">sterne part of <HI>Gui|ana</HI>
to the most Western of <HI>Popaian,</HI> the longitude is computa|ted
at 35 d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">grees, as for the latitude, that also differeth very
much. The Northerne corner reacheth to the 53 degree; the
Nore-west, so farre as it is yet discovered, but to 48, the maine
body of it falling between those corners (which by some are fit|ly
compared to hornes) riseth no farther then the 24 degree.
The forme of the South part of <HI>America</HI> beyond the Equinocti|all
is no lesse irregular, the generall description whereof I here
forbeare, as intending in this booke to write onely of the Nor|therne
part.</P>
<P>Now for the method which I have proposed to my selfe in
the particular description hereof, it is thus. I shall begin with
the most Northerne part thereof, which is <HI>New-found-Land;</HI>
from whence keeping the Sea-coast, (the course I intend to ob|serve
constantly through-out this Discovery:) I shall forthwith
fall upon our chiefe English plantations, and so taking view of
<HI>Florida</HI> lying upon the Sea-coast for many hundred leagues, be|tween
<HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Nova-Histania,</HI> so farre as the Mediterra|nian
Sea will permit, I shall (God assisting) retu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ne againe and
surveigh the Islands great and small, comming in betweene the
two parts of the Continent, which (as I said before) in some
places being farre more, in others farre lesse, are divided the one
from the other.</P>
<P>Having done with the Islands, I am againe to bend West|ward,
and according to the Sea-coast, to proceed with all the
p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rts of that part of this North <HI>America,</HI> falling downe to the
Equinoctiall, adjoyning to the South <HI>America,</HI> much la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ger and
much richer then are the Islands, or the Northerne side of the
Continent: Though therefore <HI>New-found-Land,</HI> many other
<PB N="12" REF="13">
Isl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nds, and the next adjacent Regions of the Nor-east Conti|nent
(with which I am to begin) afford but very little that may
invite us thither; yet I hope those who begin to reade this <HI>Com|pendium,</HI>
will either reade it over, or at least passing over these
Countries of much lesser worth, wil fall carefully to peruse what
here by mee faithfully is related out of many approved Authors,
concerning the pleasant habitations, exceeding fertility of the
earth, abundant provisions in all kinds, and incredible treasure
of many other Kingdomes and Provinces, lying Southward and
South-west down to the Equinoctiall: Yea, and if it should be
granted (as it cannot be granted without condemning of folly
and falshood, more than 50 authors who have written more or
lesse of this part of the <HI>New-World,</HI> &amp; many hundred witnesses,
who in severall Islands and parts of this wide Continent have
seene and injoyed more then I have expressed thereof) yet with
true Christians (who in some good measure understand what it
is to live or dye for ever) the preservation of many thousands of
soules out of those millions of men who now fit in darknesse and
perish eternally for want of the light of the Gospell, ought to be
of so high esteem, and so prerious in their eyes, as that though the
most, or all of the fore-named invitations should be wanting, yet
they should be content, I say not, to part with all, but with some
considerable portion of their estates, whereby a strong Navy
might withall conveniency be s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nt into such places of this North
<HI>America,</HI> as the wisdome of Parliament shall judge meetest for
the propagating of the Gospell. Now to proceed in a particular

for that the comming in unto them hath often proved
dangerous, the seas being in most places very narrow, by reason
of the foresaid great Islands, and many more which formerly did,
and now doth cause them who trade thither to steere a more
safe course (above the said Islands) more to the North-east, be|tween
them and <HI>New-found-Land.</HI> They are knowne by these

<P>Now concerning the goodnesse of this soyle and climate, the

side of <HI>Canada</HI> from the fall of it to the River <HI>Saguenay</HI> (as far
as is yet discovered,) is found to be mountenous, wooddy
and barren; besides, the comming up the River on that side is
found much more dangerous than that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o the South, which also
in many places requireth carefull circumspection, But then the
land is much more fruitfull and convenient to trade for Bevours
and rich Furres (the grand commodity here to be expected) by
reason there are more store of Natives to trade withall: In the
generall, all this part of the Countrey is judged to be over cold
in Winter, to be well inhabited, though yet it be constantly af|firmed
that the Natives might live very plentifully there, were
they not carelesse in sowing, planting, and making timely pro|visions;
and so prodigall in spending in two or three moneths,
what might serve them the whole year. Sure it is that the <HI>French</HI>
have taken a great opinion of it, for besides many voyages for|merly
made, they have from the yeare 1608. to the year 1616.
made six voyages under the conduct of the fore-named <HI>Cham|plany,</HI>
and it is no lesse certaine that the <HI>French</HI> have continuall
trading thither as finding good returne, especially for Bevours

in regard of fertility it comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">th far short of old <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>And now will I very briefly impart unto you (as far as is re|quisite)
what hath beene performed by our Nation in those
parts.</P>
<P>In the yeare 1606. King <HI>Iames</HI> did under the Great Seale Li|cence
a Plantation there, which was undertaken by some Noble
men, and some M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">rchants, conditionally that neither should
plant within an hundred miles the one of the other. The first
Colony consisting of an hundred husbandmen, sent at the charge,
for the most, of the Lord Chiefe Justice <HI>Popham,</HI> under the go|vernment
of <HI>George Popham,</HI> in the yeare 1609. entered the
great River <HI>Saga de Hoc,</HI> and by the bankes of the said River
setled themselves, where they continued for the space of one
yeare, and then returned into <HI>England,</HI> for that they were not
able to provide for themselves, by reason of the death of both the
<HI>Pophams,</HI> by whose care and charge they were chiefly governed
and sustained. But their unexpected returne, was so displeasing
to many other Adventurers here, as that for a good while after,
they cast off all care of any further Plantation there.</P>
<P>Hereupon the <HI>French</HI> fell upon those parts, but they were easi|ly,
and suddenly beaten out by Captaine <HI>Argall.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="17">
After this, with far greater preparation was Captaine <HI>Hobson</HI>
sent forth out of <HI>England,</HI> with two of those Natives, who were
intended for Interpreters, (as having gotten some little know|ledge
of our <HI>English</HI> tongue) in the time of more than two yeares
abode here. But the voyage was frustrated, by reason that the
Natives then were very much incensed with our <HI>English</HI> men,
because one <HI>Hunt</HI> an <HI>English</HI>-man, had not long before most per|fidiously
allured twenty of them into his Shippe, under pre|tence
of Commerce, and so perfidiously carried them away, and
sold them for slaves unto the <HI>Spaniard.</HI></P>
<P>A third and fourth voyage was performed in the yeare 1614,
and 1615, by Captain <HI>Iohn Smith,</HI> but those neither with any
good successe, for in the former, he neither discovered any gol|den
or silver Mines, nor yet found any such usefull Whales as he
expected. And in the other voyage, he was taken by the <HI>French</HI>
Pirates, and by them for a while detained.</P>
<P>A fifth voyage accompanied with a Colony of 19. families,
set forth from <HI>Plimmouth</HI> in the beginning of September, in the
yeare 1620. and on the nineteenth of November following, they
entered a nooke of the Sea ten miles from Cape <HI>Cod,</HI> and there
they stayed untill the sixteenth of December. But not liking the
place, they removed to another more fertill and more commodi|ous,
over against <HI>Milford</HI> Haven, where having built them a
Towne, called <HI>Plimmoth,</HI> they have continued for more than
twenty yeares. And since within these twelve yeares last past,
many hundreths of families have resorted either to new <HI>Plim|mouth,</HI>
or they have made other plantations, as those of <HI>Bristall</HI>
neare Cape <HI>Anna,</HI> and <HI>Connock</HI> neare <HI>Hinders</HI> Bay, where they
have continued a good while, every yeare better and better ac|commodated
with necessary provision for life, and not without
some indifferent intercourse and correspondency with the Na|tives,
upon whom they have thus far wrought, toward the bring|ing
them to God, as that they usually acknowledge the God of
the <HI>English,</HI> to be good, but their god (which they call <HI>Tanto)</HI>
to be nought. And yet for feare of the Devill by whom they are
expresly prohibited, they dare not frequent our Plantatione, nor
confer with our men about Christian Religion, so often as they
would. Neither indeed is it likely our men should be able to doe
<PB N="21" REF="17">
any good upon those (in respect of a happy conversion to Christ)
so extreamely seduced and hardened infidels, unlesse they were
better able to give them Law, and by a holy violence compell
them as it were to come in, which may be done without any
colour of injustice, or cru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lty, as tending both to their temporall
and eternall felicity; especially unlesse they had a greater power
and meanes to take away their young children, whereby they
might become ours, and so be brought to the knowledge of
Christianity, which they might successefully impart unto their
miserable seduced parents, at least they would be sure to sticks

youth. And this rule ought generally to be observed in all other
our Plantations in <HI>America,</HI> either made, or to be made.</P>
<P>I might adde many other generall and particular observations
concerning <HI>New England,</HI> but it would not agree with my for|mer
proposall, which was not to write all of any place, but some|what
of every place. Wherefore (leaving those who are desi|rous

<P>The fourth is <HI>Patowomeke,</HI> a very wide and deepe River, Na|vigable

it, and it is on either side, in regard of the commodiousnesse, and
pleasantnesse of the soyle much inhabited, and is able out of three
Villages only, <HI>Adigcomoco, Onawmament, Noyowane,</HI> to send

<P><PB N="25" REF="19">The last and least River is called <HI>Pawtunxt,</HI> the Inhabitants

<P>And now I shall acqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">int you with such things as the earth
bringeth forth of her owne accord, as also what grain and other
fruits carefull husbandry may produce.</P>
<P>Store of grasse in many places there is not, not because the soile
is unfit to yeeld it, but that it is hindered by the over-shadowing
of trees, which almost in every place groweth into great abun|dance,
a thing easily to be amended, bycutting downe good store
of them, as appeareth plainly in some of our Plantations, where
this course being carefully performed: They have besides store of
grasse, store of <HI>English</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> graine; yea, I have been cre|dibly
informed by divers persons of good worth, that they have
many fields belonging to a Plantation, where the ground yeeld|eth
greater increase upon bare tillage than ours here in <HI>England</HI>
doth, with the most chargeable, and most painfull husbandry.</P>
<P>Among the fruitfull trees of the wood, the prime are the Oak,
Walnut, Mulberry, Prune Damson trees, of the fruit whereof
stamped together, the Natives make of the dryer part that which
serveth them as well as bread; and with the liquid part that
which contenteth them as well as beere: They have also store
of Cherries, and Grap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">s greater than ours, though nothing so
sweet, which undoubtedly may be justly imputed to the want of
due husbandry, in setting, grafting, and pruning them. It hath
besides diverse other trees, which though they beare no fruit,
yet are they no lesse profitable for building and other uses, as
<PB N="26" REF="20">
namely the Cedar, the Cyprus, and the Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">affras.</P>
<P>It sends forth also of its owne accord great variety of herbs
and roots, very usefull both for food and Physicke.</P>
<P>The grain which the Natives set, in the place where great trees
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ood, a yeare or two before they had first burnt them down, and
then rooted them up, are chiefly West-<HI>Indian</HI> Wheat, and Peaze,
which being set in April, (foure wheat and two peaze graines, in
several holes distant foure foot each from other;) in August they
receive a wonderfull increase, every stalke bearing usually two
or three eares, and every eare two hundred, some five hundred
graines, which are as big, and as sweet, as our Rounsevals; but
our Country-men (besides the <HI>Indian</HI> graine) doe now sow in
great quantity our Wheat, Barley, Peaze and Oats, and receive
usually as you have heard, a greater increase than our <HI>English</HI> land
affordeth.</P>
<P>The Beasts which the North part of <HI>Virginia,</HI> of it self offord|eth,
whose flesh yeeld wholesome nourishment, are upon the
matter only Deere, of severall kinds, Castors, Hares, and Squir|rels
as big as our Conneys, and with either of these it aboundeth.
But besides these, our Plantations doe at this present so abound
with Neat and Swine, as that they feed more plentifully on them
than they need; and as I have been credibly informed by divers
worthy inhabitants, that they can, upon occasion spare sufficent,
Beefe, Porke, Turkies, Hens, and Salt-fish, with such store of
graine as may sufficiently victuall any Navy of ours which shall
be imployed that may.</P>
<P>The flying fowle there, such as are for prey, are Eagles and
divers Hawkes; for food there rre Partriges, Pigeons Turkies,
Black-birds, Thrushes, and in the Winter (though but little in
the Summer) they do abound with Water-fowles of all sorts,
Swans, Cranes, Geese, Ducks, and many more, whom we of
<HI>Europe</HI> never knew. For Fish, there are Sea-calves, Salman,
Trout, E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">les, Soles, Herrings, Mullets, Pearch; and of all kind
of Shell-fish, far greater and better than are ours.</P>
<P>Now as concerning the condition of the Natives, it may suffice
to know that some few of them, as the <HI>Sasquesahanoxs,</HI> who lye
most Northerly about two miles from the grand River <HI>Chese|peacke,</HI>
are Giants in comparison of us; that other, as the <HI>Wicko|comacks</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="20">
are Dwarfs, though for the most part they are of a com|petent
stature, borne white, but turning tawny by continuall
painting of themselves; they are strong and nimble of body, and
well inured to indured Winter and Sommer; In Winter they
lye in the woods by a great fire, clothed with the hairy skins of
Deere and Castors, in Sommer with smooth skins.</P>
<P>In the year 1606. at the charge of some Nobles and Citizens,
under the Government of Master <HI>Neoport,</HI> a Colony of about an

where at the first they were kindly rece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ved by the Natives,
but it continued not long, for within a while they refused to sup|ply
them with any provision of victuals, and in the end they set
upon them both by treachery and force, to subdue them, which
they very hardly withstood, being almost fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ished, and had un|doubtedly

of an hundred and twenty more men, and of proportionable
provision happily arrived out of <HI>England,</HI> under the conduct of
the foresaid Master <HI>Neoport,</HI> in whose absence Captain <HI>Smith</HI>
was Governour; but this was but a short refreshing, by reason
that a great part of their provision was consumed by casualty of
fire, neither was there any good agreement between the chiefe
Officers there, or such a continued supply hence as was requisite,
so as they fell again into a very hard condition, being extreamely
pinched with famine, and daily assaulted by the Natives, in so
much as they were all resolved to have retured into <HI>England,</HI> had
it not been for the Lord <HI>De Laware,</HI> by whose comming with
store of all provision, they were comforted and supported: And
so they continued in a much bettering estate, under the Com|mand
of Captain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Smith,</HI> Master <HI>Dale,</HI> and Master <HI>Gates:</HI> Cap|tain

which by the comming of Master <HI>Dale</HI> and Master <HI>Gates</HI>
was made as good again. And in this flourishing increasing con|dition,
they continued from the year 1610, unto 1621, in which
yeare they lost by an unexpected treacherous surprisall of tae Na|tives,
three hundred and forty, and had been utterly destroyed,
had not <HI>Iames</HI> Towe escaped by a <HI>Virginian,</HI> who had got some

recovered that losse, being now more than a thousand, and com|manding
the Natives as they please: Many other remarkable
passages touching this part of <HI>Virginia,</HI> are to be found in Cap|taine
<HI>Smiths</HI> Discourse thereof.</P>
<P>The greater and more fertill part of <HI>Virginia</HI> is the Southerne,
found out (as I said) by Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> and since amply de|scribed
by our country-man Master <HI>Harcourt,</HI> who affirmeth that
there are great store of Deere, Conneys, and big Squirrils, which
afford very sweet and wholesome nourishment, and no lesse
abundance of Fowle, as Peacocks, Partridges, Stock-doves,
Cranes, Hernes, Swans, Geese; as also of Fish, as Sturgeon, Her|ring,
Rayes, Mullets, Plaice, Soles, Trouts, Eeles, and many
more, beside infinite store of all kind of Shell-fish, and all of these
very usefull for mans sustentation: There are likewise in this
Southerne part, many Merchantable commodities, besides ample
provision of almost all things necessary for shipping, which with
a competent supply of men and Ammunition from <HI>England,</HI>
might within a short time, by Gods blessed assistance, command
the Northerne parts of <HI>America,</HI> where would be found silver
and gold sufficient, though they never went over the Line, to

a small Colony sent into this part of <HI>Virginia,</HI> at the charge of
Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> but finding themselves not able long to resist
the Natives, they returned into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>A Second Expedition was undertaken in the yeare 1585, by
Sir <HI>Richard Grinvill,</HI> who continued not long there, but left a
Colony of an hundred and seven under the command of Sir <HI>Ra|phael

<P>The last voyage we reade of, was undertaken at the charge of

<P>The Inhabitants are of a tawny colour, of great stature, and

<P>Their Religion is the same, or not much differing from that

<P>The <HI>Spaniard,</HI> as also the <HI>French,</HI> have made many voyages in|to

<P>The first <HI>Spanish</HI> Expedition was undertaken in the year 1512.
from the Isle of <HI>Portorico,</HI> by <HI>Portius,</HI> from whom it received

<P>A second voyage was undertaken in the yeare 1520, by <HI>Vas|ques,</HI>
from <HI>Hispaniola,</HI> who performed nothing memorable
there, save only this infamous act of inviting many of the Na|tives

them into miserable bondage.</P>
<P>A third voyage was made to as little purpose, by <HI>Narvesius,
Anno</HI> 1526, who stayed so long in the search of the South-west
part of <HI>Florida,</HI> which is the most barren part, as they were faine
to eat one another.</P>
<P>The most remarkable was undertaken by <HI>Ferdinando &agrave; Soto,</HI>
from the yeare 1536, unto 1541, in which time he with his Ar|mie
of nine hundred foot, and five hundred horse, were the
greater part consumed, having not found out (what they chiefly
sought after) any golden or silver mines; the remainder of his
souldidiers, which were not a fourth part of those he brought
from <HI>Cuba,</HI> were after his death under the conduct of <HI>Ludovi|cus
Moscosus,</HI> brought into <HI>Nova Hispania,</HI> not without great
difficulty, being often fiercely set upon, and prosecuted by the
Natives. After which very chargeable and unprosperous voyage
of <HI>Hernandus</HI> the <HI>Spaniard</HI> for many yeares did intermit any
further search of <HI>Florida,</HI> which indeed was never throughly
by them, as having searched no further than that part of the
Countrey, which lyeth opposite to the Gulfe of <HI>Nova Hispania,</HI>
and not within and beyond the Straits of <HI>Bohema,</HI> lying towards
<HI>Virginia,</HI> which is by many degrees the more fertill soyle, and

<HI>Florida,</HI> in the yeare 1542, where they arrived within two mo|neths

from thence following the Sea-coast towards the North, they

civill war that as then happened very fierce in <HI>France,</HI> a long ex|pected
supply being not sent from thence, a mutiny arose among
his souldiers, so as <HI>Ribaldus,</HI> though ha was well entertained, and
supplyed by the Natives, was inforced to returne into <HI>France,</HI> af|ter
some discovery made of the North-east part of <HI>Florida,</HI> not
without the losse of some men, though of more money; And in
his returne (for want of victuals) they killed one of their owne

was friendly received by the Natives, but could not find any gold
or silver Mines, though he spent much travell and time in search
after them, so long as his provision was all spent; And the Na|tives
growing both unable, and unwilling to supply him any
longer, he was resolved to have returned into <HI>France,</HI> if the fore|said
<HI>Ribaldus</HI> had not againe arrived there with thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> small ships

<P>The first River from <HI>Ante</HI> one hundred leagues is <HI>Nieves,</HI> from

(a countrey of highest esteem with the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> for riches and
fruitfulnesse;) but having passed as far as the Northwest Seas of
<HI>America</HI> will permit, I take it to be our best course to returne
back againe to view the Ilands, and the more Southeast parts of
the Continent, lying far nearer, and every way of as good conse|quence
for the propagating of the Gospell, and the setling of
some weake Plantations which we have there already, for the
continuall sending forth more Colonies, and for the obtaining
store of treasure, and many rich merchantable commodities.</P>

<HEAD>Cuba.</HEAD>
<P>THE first great Iland in our returne lying most to the West, is
<HI>Cuba,</HI> having <HI>Hispaniola</HI> Easternly to usward, distant from
the first Easterne part thereof which is <HI>Cape Mayzi,</HI> twelve
leagues, to the West it is divided from <HI>Nova Hispania</HI> by a long
and large interposition of Sea, called <HI>Mexico;</HI> To the North it
<PB N="35" REF="24">
hath the <HI>Lucayicke</HI> Islands, The neerest parts to the South is the
Island <HI>Iamaica.</HI></P>
<P>From the East promontory of <HI>Mazi</HI> to Cape <HI>Anthony</HI> full
West it extendeth it self no lesse then 230 leagues but in breadth
where it is largest it exceedeth not forty leagues, where narroest
not fifteene, A very large Island and fruitfull soyle able
abundantly to sustaine many thousand men, for the Natives are
well nigh utterly destroyed by the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> And the few <HI>Spanish</HI>
inhabitants at this time there remaining are not able to make use
of the fifth part thereof. The Climate is somewhat hot, but yet
healthfull and reasonable temperate, it is so over stored with
kine as they kill them meerely for their hides, and so with hogges
as they know not what to doe with them.</P>
<P>It hath in it a Cathedrall, and a Monestery. To the East thirty
leagues distant; and within ten leagues of the Northern Sea
lieth a Towne called <HI>Baracoa</HI> neer to which runneth the River
<HI>Mares.</HI> To the North West likewise thirty leagues lieth <HI>Baiamo,</HI>
which though it be an inland towne yet it is well furnished with
usefull commodities, by meanes of the great river <HI>Cante</HI> which
falleth into the Sea on the South-side of the Island, A fourth
Towne whereunto belongeth a good haven <HI>Porto del Principe</HI>
lying to the Northside neer forty leagues from Saint <HI>Iages;</HI> On
the Southfide more then fiftie leagues from <HI>Iages</HI> lieth the Town
<HI>Spiritus Sanctus,</HI> And betweene these lie the great mountaines
<HI>Tarquino,</HI> Cape de <HI>Crus,</HI> and a great inlet of the Sea, the Land
bending to the North, and to the North-east no lesse then a de|gree,
but the coming up unto them (by reason of the many rockes
and shelves) is somewhat dangerous.</P>
<P>From hence being more then halfe the length of the Island
unto Cape <HI>Anthony</HI> (the most Westerne promontory of great note
with mariners.) On the South-side also lieth the Town Seas, Port
<HI>Xagua,</HI> and Cape <HI>Corrientes</HI> opportune places to harbour, and
take in water, and wood. The West end of <HI>Cuba</HI> from Cape
<HI>Anthony</HI> bendeth Northward where lie the <HI>Organes</HI> observed by
Saylors to be dangerous touching upon in regard of many sands
rockes, and shallowes, but after the Land falling into the East
not above nine miles from <HI>Habana</HI> there are two very convenient
Ports Port <HI>Puercos</HI> and Port <HI>Marien,</HI> but of all the Ports of
<PB N="36" REF="25">
<HI>Cuba, Habana,</HI> on the Northside neer the West end of the Iland
is farre the largest, the safest, and most renowned. It is strongly
Fortified both by nature and by Arte, by a narrow coming up
unto it by Sea, and with strong Castles, as it is thought to be in|vincible,
and therefore hither as to a most secure harbour from
all parts of <HI>America</HI> the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet meeteth yeerly, and so be|ing
gathered together returne about the beginning of September,
with there farre greater treasure collected, then considerable
Forces to conduct it safely into <HI>Spaine.</HI> Neither indeed is <HI>Haba|na</HI>
so impregnable, but that (a Navy Royall landing some of their
Forces at Port <HI>Marien,</HI> or Port <HI>Puercos</HI> aforesaid may take both
Town &amp; treasure before the <HI>Spanish</HI> Navy can put from thence,)
if they could in a seasonable time somewhat about Septem|ber,
light upon the <HI>Spanish</HI> Fleet. And if the Grandes of <HI>Spaine,</HI>
have (by reason of the large pension of 3. or 4000. pounds
yeerly paid to many pensioners here) such intelligence of an in|tendment
that way, yet though we should misse of the Fleet for
one yeer, we might be sure to seize upon the Towne, and so
greatly straighten them in their yeerly returnes, and in few
yeers become Commanders of those narrow Seas, through
which their vast treasure is yearly conveighed.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="place">
<HEAD>Hispaniola.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HIspaniola</HI> lyeth between the degree of eighteen and twenty
one of the North latitude. The most East end of it at Cape
<HI>Enganno,</HI> is very narrow: the most West end, between Saint
<HI>Nicholas,</HI> to the North and Cape <HI>Dona Maria,</HI> to the Southside,
is broader then any other part of the Island. The length from
East to West 120. leagues, the breadth as it is related by <HI>Spanish</HI>
Authors is 60. leagues where it is widest, where narrowest thir|ty.
The temperature of the aire till noone is somewhat over hot,
but after continually temperate. The commodities of Suger, and
Cow-hides are more abundaut here, then in any of these Islands.
<HI>Acosta</HI> reporteth that from hence in the yeer 1587. were brought
into <HI>Spaine</HI> 9000. Chests of Suger, &amp; they though kill their Beasts
<PB N="37" REF="25">
most for their hides, yet they multiply to fast upon them, and
such is the increase of horse, and hogges, which sufficiently
proveth the exceeding fertillity of their soyle, there having been
neither Neat, horse nor hogges, in the whole Ile, before it was
stored by the <HI>Spanish,</HI> not above 150 yeers since.</P>
<P>Now to begin the particular description, of the Ile, of
the Townes, Rivers, and Ports according to the severall Pro|vinces,
as they lie from East to West, betweene North and
South. The most Easterne Province called <HI>Hygvey</HI> is a rough,
and mountainous place, yet well furnished, with variety of
fruitfull trees. To the South, lie two small Islands <HI>Catilina</HI> and
<HI>Zybo</HI> well provided with good nature and store of cattell, as
also the Island <HI>Saona</HI> of a larger extent, which though it be not
now inhabited, yet it is very commodious for Ships to furnish
themselves with severall sorts of provision, it abounding with
great store of fruits and wholsome cattell.</P>
<P>The next province is <HI>Iagvagua</HI> upon the South Coast,
wherein standeth <HI>San Domingo,</HI> the onely chiefe City of the
Island built by <HI>Bartholomeus Collumbus</HI> Anno 1494. on the East|side
of the River <HI>Osama,</HI> but afterwards removed by <HI>Nicolas
Obando</HI> to the Westside. It is neatly built and stately with
stones, and environed with a strong wall. It is the seat of an
Archbishop, and the place where the governour of the Island, and
all the Kings officers do reside, and but that it is not conveniently
supplied with water, it might wel passe for one of the best cities in
all <HI>America.</HI> It flourished exceedingly in the preceeding age, but
since the finding out of <HI>Peru,</HI> it hath lost much of its spendour,
as being lesse frequented by Merchants. The inhabitants hereof
according to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> own relation, doth not exceed 600.
families of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the Moores and Mungrels (which are begot
of <HI>Spanish</HI> and Moores) amounting to as many more. It was ta|ken
in the yeer 1586 by Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> with 1200. men,
but the spoil came far short of expectation, there being found
great store of brasse coyne but little gold. To the North of this
prime City, in the same Province is the City <HI>De La Concep|tion,</HI>
wherein is a Cathedrall and a Monastry as also the
Towne <HI>Gotuy.</HI> Not farre from <HI>San Domingo,</HI> the Pro|vince
of <HI>Cayagua</HI> beginneth, and extendeth it selfe on the
<PB N="38" REF="26">
South coast near 160 miles, and in this Province is <HI>Azna</HI>
commonly called <HI>Compostella</HI> very rich in Sugers, and five con|venient
havens <HI>Nizao, Formoso. Ocoa, Caligna,</HI> and <HI>(Yagnion,</HI>
it selfe,) all greatly frequented especially <HI>Nizao,</HI> and <HI>Ocoa</HI> by
the Dutch, for the abundance of Suger and hides, untill of latter
yeers, trading there hath beene utterly prohibited, by the King
of <HI>Spaine,</HI> Upon this coast are three little Islands (little better
then Rocks) <HI>Beta, Alta, Vela, Frayles,</HI> wherein though there be
nothing worth observation, yet are they carefully to be observed
for the preventions of Shipwracke, The next Province to the
West, and more to the North is <HI>Baoca</HI> very mountaines, and so
hard of accesse as it cost the <HI>Spaniard</HI> very dear before he could
gaine it. The most Southwest Province is <HI>Hanigvagia</HI> very
plaine, pleasant, and fruitfull, wherein standeth <HI>Savana</HI> just op|posite
to <HI>Baqua,</HI> a small but very considerable Island to furnish
navigatours hath also in it, Cape <HI>Tuburo,</HI> and the promontory
<HI>Dona,</HI> and many safe harbours for Ships. From the last of these,
the Land turning to the East many leagues, admitteth of a great
inlet of Sea, upon which bordereth <HI>Zagua,</HI> a Province no lesse
fruitfull, and pleasant then the former, in which standeth the
Towne called <HI>Iaguana,</HI> well provided with store of excellent
Salt. And neer unto the North, is the Island <HI>Guanabo.</HI> The
most Northwest is Cape Saint <HI>Nicholas,</HI> where beginneth the
first Northside Province of the Island <HI>Marien,</HI> where <HI>Christo|phorus
Columbus</HI> built <HI>Navidad,</HI> hereunto belong two Islands
<HI>Mosquites</HI> and Port <HI>Palma</HI> the one to the East the other to the
West. The next Province is <HI>Lawega Reall,</HI> extending it selfe 70
leagues in length twenty in breadth admirable rich in medowes
and Pastures. Between this Northerne Province and <HI>Yaquimo</HI> to
the South lie to other, <HI>Cibao</HI> sometime abounding with golden
mines, and <HI>Maguana</HI> with in comparable meadowes, as being
almost incompassed with two wide Rivers <HI>Niba,</HI> and <HI>Yaquen.</HI>
There are belonging to this spacious Province two Townes of
good note Saint <HI>Iago</HI> and Port de <HI>Plata,</HI> besides four convenient
havens Cape <HI>Francis, Port Riall, Mons Christi,</HI> and <HI>Port Isa|bell.</HI>
The most Northeast is <HI>Samana</HI> unto which belongeth one

<HEAD>Porto-Rico.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Portorico</HI> lying to the North, short of the 19 Degree of the
North latitude, is to the East of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> neare sixteene
leagues. To the West of <HI>Virgo, Gorda,</HI> and <HI>Anagado,</HI> the most

Promontory of <HI>Vnezuella,</HI> in the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> to the
Northeast it is distant one hundred thirty leagues. The Climate
is very pleasant, only sometimes in the moneths of December and
January, it is infefted with too much raine; in June, July and
August, with somewhat immoderate heat, and terrible tempests,
which they call <HI>Huracanes.</HI> The land for the most part riseth and
falleth with convenient small fruitfull hils and vallies, though
<PB N="40" REF="27">
the fruitfulnesse thereof is much hindred with the over-great
store of <HI>Guiabo</HI> trees. The Townes and Ports of this Iland are
but few: about the middle of the North side lyeth <HI>Porto-Rico,</HI>
the only Towne of note, built after the Spanish fashion, and di|vided
into fair streets: it hath in it a safe Haven for ships, a
stately Cathedrall, and a Monastery: and though it hath no wals
it is well fortified by land and sea: yet not so, but that it was ta|ken
by our countrey man the Earle of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> who found
there a rich booty, and at least seventy great peeces of Ordnance,
which he brought away <HI>Anno</HI> 1597. It hath since in the yeare
1625 beene assaulted by <HI>Henricides</HI> the Dutch Generall, who
though he demeaned himself very valiantly in the attempt, could
not obtaine it. The other Ports on the North side of the Iland, as
<HI>Visa, Canaba,</HI> and <HI>Cabeca,</HI> to the East of <HI>Portorico,</HI> are not safe,
as being exposed to the Northern tempests and shelves, and sands
which lye before them. In the Northwest corner lyeth <HI>Agada,</HI> a
very oportune Haven to water in, between which and <HI>Portorico</HI>
the Rivers <HI>Cami</HI> and <HI>Cabuco</HI> fall into the sea. Directly to the
West side of the Iland, somewhat about the middle, lyeth the Ri|ver
<HI>Guiabo,</HI> by which they passe to Saint <HI>Germin</HI> four leagues re|mote
from the Westerne sea, the Towne is but small, and hath
been often taken by the French. Between the harbour belonging
to it, which is the mouth of <HI>Guiabo</HI> and <HI>Aguada,</HI> directly to the
west side of the Iland lyeth the Rock <HI>Zacheo,</HI> inconvenient and
dangerous. There are other small villages in the Island but none o|ther
of great worth or note.</P>
<P>On the Southside most to the West lieth Cape <HI>Roxo,</HI> neer
which our English have found some salt pits very usefull for
those who travaile those parts. From Cape <HI>Roxo</HI> lie the havens
of <HI>Guaima, Xaria; Guadianilla,</HI> and <HI>Guaiama</HI> distant five or
six leagues the one from the other. On the Southeast-side lie the
small Islands <HI>Bieque,</HI> on the East coast, then are onely these two
Ports Saint <HI>Iames</HI> and <HI>Yabucoa.</HI> The prime commodities of this
Island are great store of Sugars, Ginger Cassia, and Neats hides.

is of twenty times more concernment the most spatious <HI>Guiana</HI>

most admired and applauded for health, wealth and pleasure.
Though therefore it be somewhat out of my way, and doe a little
obscure my proposed method, by the Mediterranian sea of <HI>Ame|rica;</HI>
yet I may not by any meanes leave them out as falling
many degrees on the North side of the equinoctiall, unlesse it be

<P>The Islands between <HI>Granada</HI> and <HI>Guiana</HI> to the South-west

full thirty leagues from <HI>Granada,</HI> and upon eight miles to
the East of <HI>Trinidado:</HI> It hath many good harbours but the
comming in unto them, especially toward the West is dangerous
by reason the seas there are very boystrous and not free from
sands and shelves. It is constantly reported by the Dutch (who
should best know it) as having many yeeres possest it to afford
many rare fruits and hearbs, variety of Fowles and Fish, and not
to be utterly destitute of foure-footed beasts, wholesome for nou|rishment,

branches of the great River <HI>Orono&abque;</HI> from <HI>Guiana,</HI> there is a ve|ry
shallow narrow sea not above three miles over, and not above
11 or 12 foot deepe; howbeit by reason of foure or five Islands
which come between them, that sea is heady and rough.</P>
<P>This Island is according to <HI>Herea</HI> his observation two hun|dred

called <HI>El Dorado,</HI> the chiefe City of <HI>Guiana,</HI> and the golden
Mountaines adjacent, by those great Rivers that empty them|selves
into the East Ocean, especially by those the two greatest,
<HI>Orono&abque;</HI> and <HI>Amazon,</HI> both upward and downeward; I meane
downeward neare from whence they arise, upward from their
wide mouthes where they fall into the Sea. Of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the
first of note who attemp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ed the search of <HI>Guiana,</HI> by the River
<HI>Orono&abque;,</HI> were <HI>Diego Ordace,</HI> a Knight of the Order of Saint
<HI>Iago;</HI> and <HI>Pedro Harnandez de Serpa:</HI> but we find nothing of
worth, or certainty, to have beene performed by either of them
in that search. Onely Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> affirmeth, that he did
see a great Anchor of <HI>Ordaces</HI> ship, lying in a Port called <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">re|quito,</HI>
300 miles within the Land, upon the River <HI>Orono&abque;,</HI> a
strong proofe he was there.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Pedro Harnandez,</HI> it is said by some; that taking his
journey from <HI>Cumana</HI> in the <HI>West-Indies,</HI> by land, toward <HI>O|rono&abque;,</HI>
which may be about 120 leagues; he was set upon, and
quite overthrowne, by a Nation of the <HI>Indians</HI> called <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">kery,</HI>
before he came to the borders of the said River. Others affirme
that he was defeated in the very entrance of <HI>Guiana,</HI> at the first
civill Towne of the Empire, called <HI>Magureguary;</HI> but of this
there is but little certainty. One <HI>Martines</HI> and <HI>Berea</HI> a <HI>Spanish</HI>
Gentleman, and a Commander of great note and quality, after
them proved farre more succesfull (if we may rely upon <HI>Bereas</HI>
own report, as it was taken by Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> from his own
mouth) <HI>Marianes</HI> discovery briefly hapened thus (I may well
say happened, for though never so true, yet was it but a meere
chance.)</P>
<P>The foresaid Voyage of <HI>Ordace</HI> being utterly lost, by reason
his provision of Gunpowder was at once blowne up, through
the negligence of this <HI>Martines;</HI> his finall judgement was, that
he should be set into a Canoa alone, without any victuall, onely
with his Armes, and so turned loose into the great River. But it
<PB N="3" REF="30">
pleased God, that the Canoa was carried downe the stream and
that certaine <HI>Guianians</HI> met it the same evening; (and having
never seene any Christian, or man before of that colour) they
carried him into the Country to be wondred at; and so from
Towne to Towne untill he came to the great City <HI>Manoah,</HI> the
place of <HI>Inga,</HI> the Emperours abode: Who upon the first sight
of him, knew him to be a Christian, as having seene many in
<HI>Peru,</HI> where he formerly lived, before his brother <HI>Atabalipa</HI>
Emperour thereof, was vanquished by the <HI>Spaniard:</HI> At what
time he and many thousands more fled to <HI>Guiana;</HI> where with|in
halfe an age, by reason of the exceeding riches and fertility
of that large Country, having subdued many Nations, he became
as potent as ever his magnificent Ancestors were in <HI>Peru.</HI> The
entertainment of this <HI>Martines</HI> by <HI>Inga,</HI> is by himselfe acknow|ledged
to have been very free and bountifull; for though he was
brought blindfold thither, and during the time of his abode in
<HI>Manoa</HI> (which was seven moneths) he was not suffered to wan|der
any where into the Country; yet <HI>Inga</HI> caused him to be
lodged in his owne Palace, and to be every way well provided
for.</P>
<P>At the end of which time, when he had somewhat learned
the language, he obtained favour of the Emperour to depart,
with whom he sent divers <HI>Guianians</HI> to conduct him to the Ri|ver
of <HI>Orino&abque;,</HI> all loaden with as much gold as they could beare,
given to <HI>Martines</HI> at his departure: of all which as he arived
neare the River side, the <HI>Oronoque poni</HI> (enemies to <HI>Inga)</HI> rob|bed
him, save onely of two great bottles of Gords, which were
filled with beads of gold curiously wrought: With these the
<HI>Orono&abque;-poni,</HI> (who thought the bottles onley to have contained
some food) permitted him to passe dowre <HI>Orono&abque;</HI> in <HI>Canoas:</HI>
From whence he got to <HI>Trinidado,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Marga|rita,</HI>
and so to Saint <HI>Ivan de Puerto-Rico;</HI> where at the time
of his death receiving the Sacrament, he affirmed the truth of
this Relation, and gave his gold beads to the Church. You have
heard the unexpected successe of <HI>Martines</HI> wandring; heare now
briefly the long and difficult travailes of <HI>Berea</HI> which were pur|posely
undertaken, as they are recorded by the same Author from
hsi owne mouth.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="31"><HI>Gundizalvus Zimenes</HI> hauing without any good successe
spent much in the search of <HI>Guiana,</HI> by those Rivers of <HI>Nuevo

meeteth and joyneth with the River <HI>Huriaparia</HI> which is
<HI>Orono&abque;.</HI> Where it is to be observed, that though <HI>Berea</HI> had
from his first setting forth from the River <HI>Casanar,</HI> fallen neare
two degrees to the South, yet he according to Geographicall
description in the best Mappes, fell short a degree in Latitude,
and at least seventy Leagues in Longitude of <HI>Macurewarai,</HI> the
nearest Towne of all <HI>Guiana,</HI> properly so called, and somewhat
more then three from <HI>Manoa</HI> the cheife City: so as keeping his
course, as he (acknowledgeth he did) downe <HI>Orino&abque;,</HI> running
directly North-East from thence, there was then no hope of
finding what he so eagerly sought for, but instead thereof re|ceived
both in his forces and provisions much losse, many of
them perishing by water, his small vessels being split upon
rockes, or overwhelmed and swallowed with the violence of
the streame, and many of them killed by the Natives. The first
place of note he arrived at, was the Province of <HI>Amapaia,</HI>
which he affirmed to be rich in gold, and though for the greatest
time of his abode there (which was six moneths) he was feircely
infefted by the inhabitants&punc; yet at length, after the concluding
of a peace betweene them, he obtained eight Images of gold (as
curiously made as any in <HI>Europe)</HI> which he sent to the King of
<HI>Spaine.</HI></P>
<P>The River of <HI>Orono&abque;</HI> running on the East side of <HI>Amapaia</HI> is
said to be twelve miles broad, and about seven or eight hundreth
<PB N="5" REF="31">
miles from its fall into the Ocean. From hence getting over to
the South-East side of <HI>Orino&abque;,</HI> he sought very diligently to
have found an entrance into <HI>Guiana,</HI> but could finde none, all
places being stopped up with high unpassable mountaines. And
although he met with divers Rivers both on the one and on the
other side of <HI>Orino&abque;,</HI> yet he professed he could not learne the
name of them, but onely of the River <HI>Caroly:</HI> neither could he
(as he pretended) for want of the use of Geography, expresse
of what degrees they were, so as he utterly despaired of obtain|ing
any good successe in this voyage, untill he came to <HI>Eme|ria,</HI>
where he found store of provision, and the inhabitants of a
more peaceable and civell disposition. The petty King thereof
was called <HI>Carapana,</HI> a man of a hundred yeeres of age, who in
his youth had beene often at the Islands of <HI>Trinidado</HI> and <HI>Mar|ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ita,</HI>
where he traded with the&punc; Christians there, and learned
much from them how to governe his people. <HI>Berea</HI> having
staid here some good space of time, and having as he conceived
gained sufficient knowledge of <HI>Guiana</HI> betaketh himself (with|out
staying any where) downe the River <HI>Orono&abque;</HI> directly to
<HI>Trinidado;</HI> from thence not long after he sent backe againe to
<HI>Carapana,</HI> who directed them to <HI>Morequito</HI> Lord of <HI>Aramaia,</HI>
as having better knowledge of <HI>Guiana,</HI> living foure or five dayes
journey from <HI>Magureguaira.</HI> This <HI>Morequito</HI> had some few
yeeres before, brought much gold to <HI>Gumana;</HI> and withall had
so highly extolled the great riches of <HI>Guiana&punc;</HI> as that <HI>Vedes</HI> the
Governour of <HI>Margarita</HI> sought to have obtained a patent
thereof from the King of <HI>Spaine,</HI> but was prevented by <HI>Berea;</HI>
which so troubled <HI>More<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">uito</HI> for (his acquaintance <HI>Vedes</HI> sake,
with whom he had much ingratiated himselfe) as that though
he feared openly to deny <HI>Bereas</HI> request, in sending guides with
his men, to trucke with the <HI>Guianians</HI> for gold: Yet privily up|on
their returne (which is reported to have beene with much
store of gold) he caused them to be mutthered neare the bankes
of <HI>Orono&abque;,</HI> one onely escaping to informe <HI>Berea</HI> of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">
act, which he conceiving to have beene plotted by <HI>Morequito,</HI>
sent a good part of the men he had at <HI>Trinidado,</HI> to take him and
to spoyle his Covntry: Before whose coming <HI>Morequi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o</HI> hearing
of it, fled to <HI>Vides</HI> for succour; but being within a while de|manded
<PB N="6" REF="32">
in the King of <HI>Spaines</HI> name, he was delivered and ex|ecuted;
whose execution so displeased the borderers of <HI>Orono&abque;</HI>
as he thought it not safe ever after to venture with a few men,
to trafficke that way, neither was his strength now sufficient to
make his way; wherefore expecting sufficient forces from other
parts of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> dominions neerest adjoyning, he staid so
long at <HI>Trinidado,</HI> untill he was surprized by Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI>
in the yeere 1596. Here then <HI>Bereas</HI> discovery of <HI>Guiana</HI>
being interrupted, it is meet I forbeare any further relation
thereof, untill I have shewed you what was performed by our
worthy. Countryman the said Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> in his first ex|pedition
thither; after which (as being after it in time) the
conclusion of <HI>Bereas</HI> discovery; as also of Captaine <HI>Kemish,</HI> and
others who were imployed by learned and expert <HI>Raleigh,</HI> that
way will more seasonably follow.</P>
<P>After six weekes and two dayes departure from <HI>England,</HI> Sir
<HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> though he staid seven dayes at <HI>Tenerife,</HI> one of
the <HI>Canary</HI> Islands in expectation of Captaine <HI>Preston,</HI> arived at
<HI>Trinidado,</HI> and tooke it within foure dayes; where loosing no
time in the prosecution of his intended designe for <HI>Guiana;</HI> af|ter
diligent search, the narrow sea betweene <HI>Trinidado</HI> and the
fall of <HI>Orono&abque;</HI> being so shallow and shelvie, more especially
those branches of the said River; all that was then discovered,
(being sound by his Sea-men not above nine foot deepe at high
water) he was enforced to leave his ships, and with a hundred
men thronged together in two barges and three whirreys to
crosse that narrow sea, and to venture up the River by those
branches; wherein when they had rowed foure dayes, his owne
barge came a ground, so as they were in some feare, whether
they should ever have got her off againe; such was the shallow|nesse
of the River when the flowing of sea had left them. After
this for many dayes more, they wandred here and there for want
of a good Pilot, not knowing which streame to take, (the streams
multiplying so exceedingly upon them) by reason of the many
great and small Islands that lye in this wide bottome of <HI>Orono&abque;</HI>
computated by the most judicious Geographers, neare a hun|dred
miles wide from South-east to North-west. After they fell
upon those Islands commonly called <HI>Trivitivans,</HI> the Inhabi|tants
<PB N="7" REF="32">
whereof commonly goe by the name <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">awani</HI> and <HI>Wara|we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI>
who in regard they are commonly overflowne from <HI>May</HI>
to <HI>September,</HI> they live in houses upon trees very artificially
built, their food being Indian bread, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">h and venisons, prepared
before hand.</P>
<P>Here they happened on a Pilot, more expert then the former,
who yet within few dayes was out of his knowledge where
againe it was their good hap to meet with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">, much more
expert, one <HI>Martin</HI> an <HI>Arwacan,</HI> whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ooke in a <HI>Canoa,</HI>
with some others going down <HI>Amana,</HI> one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"> the greatest armes
of <HI>Orono&abque;</HI> to <HI>Margarita</HI> with store of bread; both the Pilot
and the bread were of singular use to Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> and
his almost fainting company&punc; without which they had undoubt|edly
beene much straightned for going any further.</P>
<P>But by direction, they quickly attained unto <HI>Arowacy</HI> on the
South side of <HI>Orono&abque;,</HI> whereof <HI>Toparimaca</HI> being Lord, enter|tained
them kindly, and furnished them with provisions&punc; as also
with another Pilot, yet more experienced in the crosse perplex|ed
streames of <HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oni&abque;</HI> as they grew higher to <HI>Gu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">na.</HI> From
<HI>Arowacy</HI> bending their course almost directly Westward, they
pasted by a great Isle called <HI>Arrow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">pana,</HI> twenty miles in length,
and six in breadth, and at nigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"> cast Ancour at <HI>Ocawyta</HI> not one
third part so bigge. The next night they stayed under <HI>Putayma</HI>
Island, from whence they could plainly discerne the continent
to the North-West, to be a large pleasant plaine betweene two
edges of moun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">aines consisting of Arable and Medow knowne
(as their last Pilot affirmed) by the name of the great Valley of
<HI>Sayma,</HI> running in length almost to <HI>Cumana</HI> neare upon
120. Leagues. The third, fourth, and fifth day they passed
the Isle <HI>Manoriparum&punc;</HI> and a great part of <HI>Arromaia.</HI> On the
sixth day they came and staied at the Port of <HI>Morequito,</HI> where
he was kindly entertained, and informed concerning the state of
those parts from <HI>Topiowary,</HI> Lord of <HI>Arromaia</HI> and unckle to the
aforesaid <HI>Morequito.</HI> The information he received from him
was, that all the Regions thereabout even to <HI>Emeria,</HI> were
called <HI>Guiana:</HI> though yet the inhabitants were called <HI>Orono&abque;|poni</HI>
as farre as the mountaines of <HI>Wacarima,</HI> which they might
from thence behold afarre off in the Continent, beyond which
<PB N="8" REF="33">
he told them, the large valley of <HI>Amariocapana</HI> did lye, whose
inhabitants were called <HI>Guianians.</HI> And that into the Provinces
which lye beyond these more to the South, there came some
yeares since multitudes of people called <HI>Oriones</HI> and <HI>Epuremei,</HI>
who possessed themselves thereof, having driven the Natives
out of their ancient inheritances; (the <HI>Cassiapagots, Eparagots,</HI>
and <HI>Arawagots</HI> onely excepted) who were then great enemies
to the Spaniard and possesse <HI>Magureguaran,</HI> a City strongly and
stately built, and withall amply furnished with gold.</P>
<P>From hence in two dayes they rowed up neere to the River
<HI>Caroli,</HI> where the heady violence of that, and the other Rivers,
(as is usuall at that time of the yeere) permitted them not then
by water to make any higher search into <HI>Guiana.</HI> Here there|fore
staying three or foure dayes, their small company was dis|persed
by direction of the Commander, to view the severall
quarters about and above the said River; which upon their re|turne,
they reported in generall to be very fruitfull, in well
growne Medowes and Pastures; exceeding commodious for
hunting, hawking, fishing, fowling; as having many plaines,
cleere Rivers, abundance of Pheasants, Partriges, Quailes, Railes,
Cranes, Herons, and most other Fowles; Deere of all sorts,
Camas or Antas, as big, and affording as good nourishment, and
as pleasant, as our English Beefe, Porkets, Hares, Lyons, Ty|gers,
Leopards, and divers other sorts of Beasts, either for chase
or food. But that which most contented them, was (as being
the thing they chiefly aimed at) the great store of gold and
precious stones, the greater and lesser hils promised them, the
very stones glistering like gold; a more then probable argu|ment,
in the judgement of the best <HI>Mineralists,</HI> that the earth
lying a fathome or two deepe, under strong spars or quarries
of such stone usually called <HI>Marcasite</HI> hideth much Treasure.
Upon due consideration of the relations made of those that Sir
<HI>Walter</HI> had sent to review the Inland (agreeing so well with
what he himselfe had then seene, neere the banke of <HI>Caroli,</HI>
which he with some few musqueteers undertooke to survey) he
confidently affirmeth <HI>Guiana,</HI> in no respect to be inferiour to any
part of the world.</P>
<P>His owne lively expressions (being a Gentleman of as great
<PB N="9" REF="33">
learning this way, as any one our age hath afforded) is worthy to
be read and seriously considered. I never saw (saith he) a more
beautifull country, nor more lively prospects, hils so raised here
and there over the valleys, the River winding into divers bran|ches,
the plaines adjoyning without bush or stubble, all faire
greene grasse, the ground of hard sand to march on either for
horse or foote, the Deere crossing in every path, the birds to|wards
the evening singing on every tree with a hundred severall
tunes, Cranes and Herons of white, crimson, carnation, pearching
on the River side, the Ayre fresh with a gentle easterly wind;
and every stone we stooped to take up, promised either gold or
silver by his complexion.</P>
<P>Your Lordship (saith he) writing to the Lord Admirall (that
then was) shall see of many sorts, and I hope some of them can|not
be bettered under the Sunne; and yet we had no meanes
but with our daggers and fingers to teare them out here and
there, the rockes being most hard of a minerall sparre, as hard
or harder then a flint: Besides, the veines lye a fathome or two
deepe in the rockes, and we wanted necessary Instruments to
have digged the treasure out. Which last clause well considered
together with what he in his booke of <HI>Guiana</HI> alleageth for him|selfe
(namely the violence of the waters hourely increasing, un|seasonablenesse
of the yeere, the smalnesse of his company, the
inforced leaving off his ships more then 400 miles for a whole
moneth, and his unwillingnesse to let the natives now perceive
that the intent of his comming was the same vvith the <HI>Spani|ards,</HI>
chiefly for gold) may in my judgement sufficiently an|swer
those, vvho have and doe still question the truth of Sir <HI>Wal|ters</HI>
high expressions of <HI>Guiana's</HI> riches, and the most fruitfull
and pleasant habitation it affordeth, for that he made no longer
stay there, and brought no more store of Treasure home vvith
him.</P>
<P>The issue of this vvorthy Travelour's first voyage vvas this,
Not being able by reason of the great downfall and over-bearing
streame of <HI>Caroli,</HI> to ascend any further, (vvithout seeing the
Rivers <HI>Baraquan, Beta, Daune</HI> and <HI>Obarro,</HI> all falling from the
West into <HI>Orono&abque;:</HI> and being distant each from other about
a degree more and more to the South;) though yet in regard of
<PB N="10" REF="34">
longitude from East to West they are much alike, either from
<HI>Macurewarai</HI> or the great City <HI>Manoa:</HI> He returned in few
dayes to the Port of <HI>Morequito,</HI> where he concluded with <HI>To|piawa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">i;</HI>
hostages being given on either side, to returne with
great forces the next yeere, and that in the time he should work
with the <HI>Oronoque poni,</HI> to joyne with them in an expedition
against their enemies the <HI>Epuremei,</HI> who possessed the regions
that most abound with silver and precious stones. But here was
the unhappinesse of the man&punc; (I might rather say of the King|dome;)
that upon his speedy retur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">e into <HI>England,</HI> not above
eight moneths from his setting forth, he could not (though he
were very gratious at Court) procure a Navy to be sent within
a yeere to <HI>Topiawari,</HI> as was promised: Whence it came to
passe, that the foresaid <HI>Berea,</HI> neglecting no time, did by the
assistance of <HI>Carrapana</HI> Lord of <HI>Emeria,</HI> againe get up the River
of <HI>Orono&abque;</HI> with 300 Spanish Souldiers as farre as <HI>Caroli,</HI> where
he built a little Towne called Saint <HI>Thomas,</HI> consisting of thirty
houses of great consequence, to bring under and keepe in the
fearfull; unarmed borderers of <HI>Orono&abque;,</HI> and also for opposing any
other Nation, who should attempt <HI>Guiana</HI> that way. But Sir
<HI>Walter</HI> (not understanding of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> building and strong
fortifying Saint <HI>Thomas,</HI>) sent forth Captaine <HI>Keymish</HI> with a
ship and a pinnace (all he was able to doe at his owne charge)
the 26 of <HI>Ianuary</HI> in the yeere 1596, (which being foure
moneths later then he promised and intended,) caused <HI>Topia|wari</HI>
and the rest of the borderers of <HI>Orono&abque;,</HI> for feare of <HI>Be|vea</HI>
and his Spanish forces, to withdraw themselves; when <HI>Key|mish</HI>
(who first discovered the genuine and best Navigable
streame of the great River <HI>Orono&abque;,</HI> within eight dayes saile
and entrance thereunto, came up to the Port of <HI>Morequito,</HI>
where finding his hopes of assistance from the Natives frustrated
and himselfe not able to encounter the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> he forthwith
for feare of surprizall, taketh downe the River againe, and so in
the fifth moneth after his setting forth out of <HI>England,</HI> return|ned
thither safe againe, though without any good successe at all.
After this I find no further attempt to have beene made by the
English upon <HI>Guiana,</HI> but that of Sir <HI>Walter</HI> himselfe, Anno
1617. when he had beene fourteene yeeres prisoner to the
<PB N="11" REF="34">
great retarding of his intended prosecution of <HI>Guiana.</HI> The
successe of this voyage was little answerable to the great prepa|ration
thereof: For though he went forth at his owne and
friends charge, with seven good ships well manned and provi|ded,
yet he brought no treasure home. And no mervaile (for
as he no lesse truly then boldly writeth to Sir <HI>Ralph Winwood</HI>
from <HI>Christophers</HI> Island) his whole designe, what ships, what
men, what Ammunition he would take with him, as also what
time he would set forth hence, and what branch of <HI>Orono&abque;</HI> he
intended to goe up to <HI>Guiana;</HI> were all made knowne to the
<HI>Spaniard</HI> before he could get out of the <HI>Thames</HI> by King <HI>Iames,</HI>
to whom he was enforced by oath (before he could get liberty
to goe) to discover the foresaid particulars. Upon which notice
speedy directions were sent from the Court of <HI>Spaine,</HI> to draw
up forces, three times as many as ours were, from <HI>Porto-Rico&punc;
Nuequo-Reygno,</HI> and other neerest adjoyning parts, to surprize
them unexpectedly. Yet such was the courage and resolution
of our men, that they went up to Saint <HI>Thomas,</HI> and tooke it,
and in it some store of rich Tobacco; but the Spanish forces
purposely abandoned the Towne, for the better defence of the
mines, so that ours could not take them, which by reason of
Woods lying on every side neare unto them, with 200 Musque|teers
they easily defended. A more then probable argument,
that the <HI>Spaniard</HI> was then possessed of those golden mines (then
sought by the English;) else, would they not have left their
Towne and betooke themselves to the defence of them? And
Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> in his foresaid letter maketh good proofe
of it, in naming the men in whose possession they then were;
and he further confidently affirmeth, that he was sufficiently able
to make good what he writ, by the King of <HI>Spa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">nes</HI> severall
grants to severall persons; as also by the Spanish Register books,
wherein appeare the abundance of Treasure the mines as then
discovered afforded, by the great summes thence arising yeerly
from the Kings fifth part. And certainly had the Spanish King
not feared, learned and experienced <HI>Raleighs</HI> future and greater
discovery and prosecution of <HI>Guiana,</HI> he would never so eagerly
have pursued him unto death as he did; which yet he had not
soone effected, had it not beene for his pensioners; here, some
<PB N="12" REF="35">
noble ignoble English men overpowerfull with King <HI>Iames,</HI>
(the reputed <HI>Solomon</HI> of his time) as now they are much more
with his Successour, much inferiour to his father in wisdome.</P>
<P>From that time to this (the <HI>English</HI> hopes being chrushed in
losse of so worthy a Commander) there hath beene either
none or little venturing from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Guiana.</HI> But the <HI>Ne|therlands</HI>
since that, have made so many yearely voyages up the
River <HI>Orono&abque;</HI> as farre as Saint <HI>Thomas</HI> (encouraged by the great
returne made from thence, not of gold but of rich Tobacco) as
that some of their skilfull Pilots, were as well able to direct the
best and safest way thither, as our Water-men are able to de|scribe
the passage from <HI>Dover</HI> to <HI>London;</HI> the very cause as is
generally conceived, why (being growne so expert in that River)
they were some yeers since so severely prohibited by the King of
<HI>Spaine</HI> to trade any more there.</P>
<P>You have heard of <HI>Guiana</HI> as it bordereth Westerly on both
sides <HI>Orono&abque;,</HI> as much as can be conveniently expressed in so
short an Epitome. You shall now heare more briefly how it ly|eth
to the East Ocean, accord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ng to the pincipall Rivers as they
fall betweene <HI>Orono&abque;</HI> and <HI>Amazon&punc;</HI> The first great River of
any note from <HI>Winkebery,</HI> the most Southerne and best naviga|ble
arme or streame of <HI>Orono&abque;</HI> is <HI>Essequebe,</HI> very broad, but
withall very shallow in the mouth of it where it falleth into the
Ocean: It is affirmed by the natives bordering upon both sides
of it, to arise within one dayes journey of golden <HI>Manoa</HI> the
prime City of <HI>Guiana;</HI> but both our <HI>English</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI>
who have diligently endeavoured to make entrance into the
continent by this River, have found it in two or three dayes not
passable, by reason of many great vvaterfals, three times as high
and more heady then is the fall of <HI>London-bridge.</HI> The Inhabi|tants
about this River, neerest to sea are called <HI>Arwaci,</HI> as barba|rous
but not so inhumane &amp; cruell as are the <HI>Caribs,</HI> who possesse
the more inland Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">try. They are continually at vvarre be|tweene
themselves, yet both great enemies to the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and
not to be trusted by us or any other Christian Nation when
they are able to doe mischiefe. The soyle especially about 20
miles from sea is exceeding fertill: the Commodities are Chri|stall,
and a kind of wood very usefull, and much desired for dy|ing
<PB N="13" REF="35">
the best colours. The next River of note is <HI>Berbice,</HI> lying
somewhat above the sixth degree, the Land adjoyning is as the
former possessed by the <HI>Arwaci,</HI> but is farre inferiour in regard
of fertility, and the forenamed merchantable Commodities. The
next two Rivers, or rather two in one is <HI>Sarname</HI> upon the sixth
degree, and <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">otera,</HI> that falleth into <HI>Sarname,</HI> three miles be|fore
it emptieth it selfe into the Ocean. The Inhabitants here|of
(being men-eaters, and very false in performing their promi|ses)
are of all others least to be trusted; neither indeed are the
Commodities thereabout of that worth (being upon the matter
onely Brasil-wood) as might invite men to venture farre into
the Country. Twelve miles more to the South is <HI>Marawyny,</HI>
a River of a wide and deepe mouth, affording above twenty
leagues convenient passage for vessels of burthen, though yet
the comming up from sea into it is very difficult: The inhuma|nity
and infidelity of the borderers is as great as the other, and
the Commodities the Land affordeth of as little worth, and
therefore seldome frequented either by us or the Netherlands.
From hence more and more to the South, five other Rivers of
greater note have their fall into the East Ocean. The first is
<HI>Cajana,</HI> inhabited by the <HI>Caribs,</HI> whose fall is computated to
be twenty leagues from <HI>Marawiny,</HI> the head of it to be more
then fifty from the South-west. The second and third <HI>Cauwo</HI>
and <HI>Wio,</HI> much upon the middle betweene the fourth and fifth
degree (inhabited by the <HI>Yayi</HI> and <HI>Shebaij</HI>) have their rising to
the South-west further into the continent. The most Southern
of the five great Rivers is <HI>Wiapoco</HI> (inhabited also by the <HI>Yayi</HI>)
lying betweene the fourth and fifth degree of latitude, into
whose channell many little Rivers fall. The regions in ge|nerall
belonging to the five foresaid Rivers, are very fruitfull,
temperate and pleasant; I say in the generall (for they are not
in all places alike.) The sea coasts (to omit further particulars)
are more hot, but yet withall moarish, and therefore lesse fruit|full
or pleasant. The Inland being mountainous is colder, but
yet more profitable, the ground that lyeth between them (both
being in some places of greater, in others of lesse extent) doth
farre exceed them both in temperature, pleasure and profit:
They abound with all manner of provision for life, with <HI>Cassavi</HI>

latitude to the South six or seven leagues: Upon the winding

(the first Port towne to us-ward) it is but of small extent, for it

to the West of <HI>Martha</HI> toward <HI>Carthagena,</HI> namely <HI>Bonda</HI> and
<HI>Poziguica</HI> are much of the same condition, healthfull but not
fruitfull.</P>
<P>The rest of this government downe to the South is invironed
with two great Rivers (with <HI>Martha</HI> to the West, and <HI>Pompa|tao</HI>
to the South-east) which being remote the one from the o|ther
more then forty leagues, for the space of two degrees of la|titude
North and South, untill the River <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ompatao</HI> turning di|rectly

(for so it is here stiled) though it selfe also be but an
arme of <HI>Martha.</HI> Now for that in so large a tract of ground
(which the long continued distance of the foresaid Rivers suffi|ciently
prove) no mention is made of any other Spanish Towne
but onely of <HI>Tenerifae,</HI> which is within forty leagues of <HI>Mar|tha</HI>
where <HI>Madalena</HI> falleth into it and <HI>Tamalame&abque;</HI> fifteene

it may and is probably conjectured that here may be found

<P>A third government adjoyning to the sea-coast is <HI>Cartag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">na,</HI>
so called from the chiefe Port towne of all <HI>Terra Firma.</HI> This
government is more spacious and populous then either of the
former, but withall it is in the generall lesse healthfull and lesse
profitable, as being for the most part either taken up with waste
unusefull Mountaines, or being pestered with many fennes and
bogges, by reason of the continuall overflowing of <HI>Martha</HI> and
and other smaller Rivers of their Valleys, that otherwise might
be much more beneficiall for the grazing of Cattell; From the

falling of that great River into the sea where this government
beginneth to the East, no mention is made of any <HI>Spanish</HI> towne

City is inferiour to very few or none in all <HI>America.</HI> It is re|ported
not onely by <HI>Spanish</HI> Authors <HI>Herea, Bap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ista</HI> and o|thers,
but also by the Dutch, who have lately more exactly
viewed the scituation of it to be very strong; it standeth in a
kind of Peninsula two miles from the maine sea which upon
that coast (unlesse in some <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ew chanels <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word">) dangerous by reason of
many shallowes, sands and shelves; the comming up to it
(though no farther remote) is likewise difficult both by water
and land.</P>
<P>The water passages are three, all narrow and shallow, serving
onely for small Vessels, and withall strongly fortified. The
land passages that are as many are very narrow made caw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y-wise
so as but few can goe a brest to force their way, being opposed
by severall strong Forts, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o make their way on either side
the cawceys is impossible, being all of them so compassed with
deep ditches and unpassable bogges: And yet for want of fresh
water, they continually fetch from <HI>Galeera</HI> where the great ships
ride, a great Navy may easily keepe them from thence, and so
inforce them in a short time to yeeld for want of water. Nor is
it impossible but that this City may be taken by the water pas|sages,
if good store of small Vessels well manned and otherwise
provided shall be imployed therein.</P>
<P>The next towne distant from <HI>Cartagena</HI> to the south-west is
<HI>Toku,</HI> where great store of precious balsome (either by distilling
of it selfe, or by incission of certaine trees) is yeerly gathered
and conveyed into <HI>Europe.</HI> It is confident<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">y reported by <HI>Monar|des</HI>
to be no way inferiour, but rather more soveraigne, for the
curing of many diseases, then was the balsome of <HI>Aegypt</HI> and
the East Countryes, in all Authors so highly commended. The
Climate is much more healthfull, the soyle more fertill and use|full

and yet not taken up with flagges and bulrushes, and other
such like increase of Marish grounds, as are <HI>Carthagena</HI> and the
more neere confines thereof.</P>
<P>Now to looke yet further into the continent, just opposite to
<PB N="25" REF="41">
the government of <HI>Martha</HI> directly to the South, from the
eighth degree of the North latitude, beginneth the Kingdome

this great Kingdome, is the next adjoyning to the government

parts of it lying betweene the River <HI>Darien</HI> and the South-sea,

Captaine <HI>Oxenham</HI> (induced by the fame of the vast treasure,
which fortunate <HI>Drake</HI> obtained in those parts) provided a ship
of a 120 Tun; in which having with him neere a hundred men,
(the winds favouring him, he came sooner then he could well
expect on the North Sea-coast of <HI>Panima</HI>) where getting as
neere as he could conveniently, for the shortest cut over to the
North sea; he landed his men, drew up his ship into a cranny,
where he left her and his great Ordnance, covered all over with
bowes. Then he and his men taking sufficient victuall, with
two field pieces, and other necessary armes, after twelve leagues
march, they came to a River which falleth into the South sea,
where he built a barge 45 foot long; in which he conveyed his
men into an Island called the Isle of Pearles (close by the side
whereof, they who come our of the South sea to <HI>Panima,</HI> must
needs passe.) Here they closely concealed themselves for ten
dayes; at the end whereof they seized upon two Pinnaces com|ming
from <HI>Peru,</HI> wherein was little lesse then 200000 .li. of
gold and silver, besides great store of rich Pearles they took from
the Islanders; both which they might certainly have conveyed
to their ship (and so into <HI>England</HI>) had not both Captain &amp; soul|diers
in their comming back in three particulars dealt very foo|lishly.
First, in too sudden discharging the two Pinnaces they
had taken by whom the Governour of <HI>Panima</HI> being much
sooner informed of the exploit then, otherwise he could have
been, made the more quick pursuit after them, with twice as
many forces as they had, Secondly, in casting the feathers of
hens they had pillaged over board, whereby they gave perfect
notice to the pursuers.</P>
<P>Of the particular River they returned by, of which before
they were very much to seek. But most of all did they forget
themselves in an unseasonable contention concerning the divi|ding
of the prize; the Souldiers refusing to beare it upon their
shoulders over the land, unlesse the might know how much
should come to every mans particular share; which demand of
theirs being as undiscreetly denied, the convention lasted so

names) doth yet run for forty leagues further, though still nar|rowed
more and more, by reason that <HI>Yucatan</HI> another part of
the continent being a very long and large Peninsula, falleth in
and joyneth with the Province of <HI>Honduras;</HI> in the narrowing
whereof lye the River <HI>Vlva, Cape de Puntas,</HI> and Port <HI>de Hi|gueras;</HI>
just in the breaking off another smaller gulfe called
<HI>Dulce.</HI> I shall now from the discovery of the Sea-coast fall
to describe so much of the continent as lyeth between Sea
and Sea.</P>
<P>Upon the North sea for 150. leagues doth the Provice of <HI>Hon|duras</HI>
extend it self, in bredth here and there more or lesse then
80. leagues, in the generall a very rich and goodly Country; for
the Valleyes thereof afford three crops of their Indian graine,
and two of our wheat, besides a continuall supply of grasse, so as
it is ever green, flourishing, and affordeth great store of provisi|on
for man and beast.</P>
<P>The Spanish Townes belonging to this Province, taking them
as I proceed in my description from East to West; are first <HI>Tru|gillo,</HI>
a league remote from sea, standing between two Rivers,
whereunto belongeth a port strongly fortified by nature and
art; which though it was taken by our English Anno 1576. yet
was it in vaine attempted by them, under the command of Sir
<HI>Anthony Sherley,</HI> in the yeere 1596. the region about is tem|perate
both in winter and summer, the soyle exceeding fertill,
maintaining great store of Cattell, graine and great variety of
excellent fruit: The Vines here in great abundance bring forth
<PB N="39" REF="48">
Grapes in wonderfull plenty twice a yeere. The Towne lyeth
to the North-east of port <HI>Cavallos</HI> forty, of <HI>Validolid</HI> the chiefe
City fifty leagues. A second Town thirty leagues to the south of
<HI>Trugillo</HI> is Saint <HI>George,</HI> in the rich Valley of <HI>Olancho,</HI> where|unto
the hils adjoyning are lately found so full of gold mines as
that the Governour of <HI>Honduras</HI> and <HI>Nicuragua</HI> have often
drawne their Forces into the field and fought for it, untill the
King of <HI>Spaine</HI> was pleased to decide it, by adjudging it a parcell
of this Province.</P>
<P>The chiefe City forty leagues to the south within the Land is
<HI>Valadolid,</HI> where the Governour and his Officers, a Bishop and
his Cathedrall men reside, very amply provided for with all kind
of provision that the goodly Valleyes neere adjoyning afford,
and greatly enriched by the gold and silver mines there lately
discovered.</P>
<P>Upon the North sea in the Valley <HI>de Naco,</HI> every way com|parable
with <HI>Valadolid</HI> but for unhealthfulnesse; foure leagues
severed lyeth the Haven Towne <HI>de Cavallos</HI> in the fifteenth
degree of latitude, and between them somewhat more to the
West are two other Spanish Townes that yeeld many mules and
great horses, as doth also the Country about <HI>Cavallos</HI> (whence
the name is taken.)</P>
<P>The government of <HI>Guatimala</HI> and two other small Provin|ces&punc;
Saint <HI>Salvator</HI> and <HI>Gulpho Dolce,</HI> lye one after another to
the south of <HI>Honduras</HI> towards the south sea, in few places lesse
then thirty leagues in bredth, in respect of fertility, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">ore of
Cattell and graine, they come not farre short of it&punc; but much in
regard of healthfulnesse and the temperature of Aire and season;
they being in some moneths over hot, in most infested with too
much raine, and which is the usuall consequence thereof with in|credible
multitudes of pestilent Flyes, Bees, Horners, scorpions,
and other though small yet deadly venemous serpents.</P>
<P>Besides these provinces, especially <HI>Guatimala</HI> so properly
called, is extraordinary subject to continuall Earthquakes, horri|ble
thundering and lightning and which is much worse, to u|suall
breaking out of flames of fire, from the sulpherous moun|taines&punc;
which sometime cast them downe in huge lumps to the
overwhelming of the Townes and Villages adjoyning; but ne|ver
<PB N="40" REF="49">
are these strange breakings out of fire, but to the great an|noyance
of man and beast, by the loathsome smoak and vapours
that necessarily issue upon them, not without much spoyle of
Corne and fruits, by reason of many thousand quarters of ashes
which at those times are thickly dispersed round about.</P>
<P>The chiefe City in these parts is Saint <HI>Iago de Guatimala,</HI>
fourteen degrees in la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">tude, 93 in longitude: From the Meri|dian
of <HI>Toledo</HI> in <HI>Spaine,</HI> to East whereof stand <HI>Trinidad</HI> and

forty leagues remote, both very convenient for trading out
of the South-sea.</P>
<P>From <HI>Nova Hispania</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> by the port <HI>Acaxulta</HI> in a
very safe channell, and not above five or six leagues from sea, the
two most Easterne Townes of <HI>Guatimala</HI> are Saint <HI>Miguel,</HI> 22.
leagues from Saint <HI>Salvador,</HI> within two leagues of <HI>Fonseca</HI>
Bay. Then <HI>Xeres</HI> eighteen leagues farther, neere to the lake of
<HI>Nicoagua;</HI> which having a short recourse to the sea, affordeth
a good Haven called Port <HI>poss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ssion;</HI> between which and port
<HI>Guatimala,</HI> that goeth up to Saint <HI>Iago</HI> for the space of eigh|ty
one leagues; there are no other considerable Havens then have
been mentioned.</P>
<P>The Havens and Rivers about <HI>Guatimala</HI> to the West, that
we may here make an end with the South sea coast belonging to
this government, are <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">oatlam, Govetlan, Colate Haziaclan,</HI>
belonging to <HI>Soconusco,</HI> a Province extended upon the south-sea,
westward thirty leagues in length, and as many in bredth
towards <HI>Verapaz</HI> and <HI>Chiapa,</HI> two midland Provinces to the
North: The Inhabitants thereof not being very many, and ha|ving
few Spaniards among them; live plentifully&punc; by reason of
the great store of Cacao, a fruit like Almonds, which the Mer|chants
of <HI>Nova Hispania</HI> fetch from thence at good rates&punc; as be|ing
of great use and high esteem as well with the Spaniards as
Natives inhabiting those parts, both to eat and drinke, but espe|cially
to drink, it yeelding a liquor exceeding wholsome and
pleasant, with some composition t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ey use maketh it no way infe|riour
to high-country white-wine or Shery-sack. Out of this Ca|cao
commodity in this little Province&punc; the King of <HI>Spain</HI> hath for
tribute every yeere at least 400 frayles of them, every frayle be|ing
<PB N="41" REF="49">
worth thirty silver Royals.</P>
<P>The next Province to the North of <HI>Soconusco,</HI> and the South
of <HI>Yucatan,</HI> having <HI>Chiapa</HI> Province, to the West is <HI>Verapaz,</HI> so
called, for that the Natives came freely in upon the preaching
of the Gospell, but having so little profited therein&punc; under such
covetous corrupt Tutors, as they know scarce any thing aright
of Christrianity, and would be very glad they could be freed
from such tyrannicall Lords. The middle part of it is somewhat
temperate, the residue is extreame hot and extreamly perplexed
with Mosquitos&punc; usually swarming in other parts of the Indies
which are hot and over moist as these are. Neither doth the soyle
(by reason of eight moneths raine, which most an end happeneth
continually) yeeld any store of Indian wheat, but little or none
of ours; and yet it bringeth forth abundance of medicinall
herbs, beautifull flowers&punc; and trees most usefull and profitable
both for nourishment and building&punc; but withall it harbours ma|ny
wild beasts; as Lyons, Tygers, Beares, but very few for the
use of man. Nor yet (so farre as I heare) have gold or silver mines
been here discovered by the Spaniard.</P>
<P>The most Westerne Province of all <HI>Guatimala,</HI> bordering up|on
the East of <HI>Nova Hispania</HI> is <HI>Chiapa,</HI> full forty leagues long,
and almost as broad every place from South to North, in regard
of over great heat and moysture&punc; of great store of wild beasts and
dangerous serpents much like <HI>Verapaz;</HI> as also in respect of the
innumerable profitable Trees there, the fruit whereof affordeth
toothsome and wholsome nourishment, the bodies speciall tim|ber,
the gumme (which in great quantities come from them)
precious Balsome and sweet odours, the bark, gumme and fruit
very rich materials to dye colours of the best esteeme with us.
But herein it farre exceedeth all the Provinces of <HI>Guatimala,</HI> in
that being competently provided with graine, it doth breed and
maintaine great store of excellent Horses, Kine, Sheep and
Swine, besides incredible variety of the best Fish and Fowle,
onely for Mines it must give place to <HI>Honduras</HI> Province.</P>
<P>Thus I have passed through the government of <HI>Guatimala;</HI>
I am now come to make entry upon those Provinces that ap|pertaine
to the royalty of <HI>Nova Hispania:</HI> For the right sur|veighing
whereof, I must of necessity againe fall to discribe the
<PB N="42" REF="50">
Sea-coast&punc; so by surrounding in <HI>Yucatan,</HI> a long and wide Penin|sula,
save onely in the necke of it where the gulss of <HI>Honduras</HI>
and <HI>Mexico</HI> come neerest together (of no lesse then 25. leagues
compasse) the sayling on either side of it is dangerous, by
reason of many scattering Islands, rocks shelves, and sands.
From the comming up againe of <HI>Honduras</HI> gulfe on the South-east
of <HI>Yucatan</HI> to the North-east, these are very carefully to be
avoyded, as most pernitious, <HI>Elbob, Lamanary, Zaratan, Pan|toia,
Quitazuwenho,</HI> which last signifieth as much as, now take
heed; It lyeth in the eighteenth degree of latiude, a full degree
more to the North then <HI>Guanima</HI> Isle, just opposite to <HI>cape
Honduras,</HI> but much of the same longitude with them; so as
though the gulfe on either side towards <HI>Yucatan,</HI> or <HI>Honduras</HI>
be not safe to saile in; yet by the channell thereof more then
twenty leagues broad in most places is safe and navigable. From
<HI>Quitazuwenho</HI> to Cape <HI>Conche,</HI> the most northeast of this Pe|ninsula,
and neerest to the Island <HI>Cuba</HI> are neer seventy leagues,
between which comes the Island <HI>Coznmel</HI> and many petty I|slands
called <HI>Mucheres.</HI></P>
<P>The North and North-west Sea-coast of <HI>Yucatan</HI> are no lesse
dangerous then the North-east; as being also full of sands shal|lowes
and rocky Islands, known by the name of <HI>Alcranes</HI> and
<HI>Negrillos:</HI> which though they be far remote from land, yet they
make the passage dangerous to come into the best ports of <HI>Comill</HI>
on the river <HI>Ligartes</HI> on that side, being themselus not very good.</P>
<P>From hence to the west, the continent falling down again more
and more to the South for three degrees, <HI>viz.</HI> from above 21. to
28. all this coast (as the other) by reason of the Isle of <HI>Sands Des|considla</HI> and <HI>Triangulo</HI> and some others no lesse sandy, but much
more rocky, is hazardous and make <HI>Cical</HI> and <HI>Telichaque</HI> (the
best Havens hereabouts) to be lesse frequented. Neither yet is
the Sea channell here adjoyning so deepe and free from sands,
as is safe for ships of any great burden to faile in. The land with|in
this long and wide Peninsula, is for the most part neither
temperate nor healthfull, save onely in the mountainous places,
nor so much inhabited but onely to the North end of it, where
standeth <HI>Merida</HI> the chief Town about twelve leagues from sea,
the Governour &amp; Bishops abode, accompanied with 100 Spanish
<PB N="43" REF="50">
Families. Another is <HI>Vallidolid,</HI> 31. leagues to the East of <HI>Me|rida,</HI>
where a great Monastry of Franciscans standeth, and where
the Natives of the region adjoyning are said farre to exceed all
others, being at least 50000.</P>
<P>A third Towne fifty leagues to the West of <HI>Merida</HI> is <HI>Cam|peche,</HI>
where Captaine <HI>Parker</HI> our Country-man, Anno 1596.
with some hazard but greater honour seized (in sight of all the
Inhabitants) upon a ship laden with gold &amp; silver and other rich
commodities, and brought her away, though they made all the
resistance possibly they could.</P>
<P>A fourth Towne is <HI>Salamanea,</HI> in the neck of this Peninsula,
not much differing in respect of longitude, though neerer a de|gree
in latitude from port <HI>Real;</HI> it belongeth to the Province
of <HI>Tabasco,</HI> of which I will say no more, but that it is very slen|derly
inhabited though yet it be of large extent, no lesse then
forty leagues, bordering upon the North-sea called the gulfe of
<HI>Mexico,</HI> as many in breth toward the South adjoyning to the
province <HI>Verapaz</HI> and <HI>Chiapa.</HI> The reasons whereof given by
Authors are, that this Country is as intemperate and unwhol|some
as any other thereabouts, and affordeth but slender susten|tation,
and but few Merchantable Commodities. The onely
Spanish Towne in this Province is called <HI>Senora Victoria,</HI> in re|membrance
of the great Victory here obtained by <HI>Cortesius,</HI>
the over prosperious, because the over cruell subduer of this and
all the Country hereabout.</P>
<P>The next Province to the South is <HI>Chiapa,</HI> much upon the
same bredth and length; whereof also little is to be said, but
that it is a more pleasant and healthfull, more abounding with
the rare, though usuall fruit of <HI>Nova Hispania;</HI> and which is
Neat, Sheep and Swine the horses are of such an excellent breed
as they are sent for as farre as <HI>Mexico,</HI> the Metropolis of <HI>No|va
Hispania,</HI> no lesse then 200. leagues distant. Here are likewise
many Eagles and other Fowles of prey, that now live upon such
wholsome and toothsome Fowle as may be better imployed for
mans sustentation, and by their meanes more easily taken. <HI>Xi|menes</HI>
maketh mention of one monstrous Bird, having one foot
like a Goose, and the other like a Faulcon, that liveth by prey
<PB N="44" REF="51">
taken both in the water and Ayer. There are in <HI>Chiapa</HI> many
Natives distinguished by the names of <HI>Zeques, Zeltales, Quelc|nes</HI>
and <HI>Secaulands,</HI> and among either of these there are many
Villages well inhabited. The onely Spanish Towne of note is
<HI>Cuidad Reall,</HI> seventy leagues to the North-east of <HI>Guatimala,</HI>
and as many from <HI>Senora</HI> in <HI>Tabasco.</HI></P>
<P>From <HI>Chiapa</HI> westward followeth the Bishoprick of <HI>Guaxaca</HI>
whereunto the Provinces <HI>Misceca, Tucepe&abque;, Zapoteca</HI> and
<HI>Guazacoalco</HI> are annexed, which take up all the continent be|tween
both seas. From the great River <HI>Guazacoalco</HI> unto the
River <HI>Alvarde</HI> on the North side, distant the one from the o|ther
fifty leagues.</P>
<P>As much more from <HI>Tecoantepe&abque;</HI> a small port, to <HI>Tequanapa</HI>
a safe Haven in the wide and deepe River <HI>Onatepec,</HI> betweene
which lyeth the famous port of <HI>Agutulco,</HI> taken with much
treasure by Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> Anno 1578. and by Captains
<HI>Candish</HI> 1586. This Bishoprick with the Provinces annexed are in
the generall (though mountainous) very fertill and healthfull, but
the Valley of <HI>Guaxaca</HI> (that <HI>Crotesius</HI> the Conquerer of this
Country and the regions thereabout chose for his inheritance)
doth exceed imagination in regard of fertility both of grasse and
Cattell, Corne and pleasant fruits, Fish and Fowle. Besides that
it containeth in it many gold and silver mines, much Chocha|neel
&amp; Silk, strong incitements to make it so fully inhabited as it
is, both with Spaniards and Natives; the Natives being repor|ted
to exceed 150000. And though <HI>Mistica</HI> and the other an|nexed
Provinces, be not every way so beneficially accommoda|ted,
yet are they so well provided with necessaries, streames a|bounding
with golden oare, small peeces of gold washed from
the mountaines, and other Merchantable Commodities, that
they also are well stored with Inhabitants; of whom this is very
remarkable, that they use the Jewish Ceremonies in particular,
Circumsicion, which they&punc; affirme to have received from their
Ancestors.</P>
<P>The chiefe Spanish Towne there is <HI>Auteguera</HI> standing in the
heart of the aforesaid incompararable Valley <HI>Zapoteca&punc;</HI> (and
<HI>Nixapa</HI> two other Towns, fall short of it full twenty leagues, the
one to the North-east the other South-east:) <HI>Agaculco</HI> a great
<PB N="45" REF="51">
Haven towne upon the South sea standeth directly to the South
somewhat more then thirty leagues. The Bishoprick of <HI>Tlas|cula</HI>
is next to <HI>Guaxaca</HI> more to the North-west, though exten|ded
also through the whole continent from sea to sea, no lesse
then 100. leagues in length&punc; in bredth to the South-sea but 18.
where we read of no Haven of note but to the North-sea, here
called the gulfe of <HI>Mexico,</HI> being full 80 leagues; there fall ma|ny
Rivers convenient for ships to harbour, lade and unlade; as
namely, the Rivers <HI>De Banderas</HI> and <HI>Zempoal, Almeria,</HI> Saint
<HI>Peters,</HI> Saint <HI>Pauls</HI> and <HI>de los Cazon.</HI> The first <HI>Banderas,</HI> be|ing
within five leagues of the famous River <HI>Alucrado</HI> in <HI>Gua|naca:</HI>
The last not above three leagues from the River <HI>Pa|nuco</HI>
in the Province of <HI>Panuco;</HI> which two differ full soure de|grees
in latitude; but the onely ports of note &amp; now of use with
the Spaniard are <HI>Vera Cruz</HI> and Saint <HI>Iuan-Uullua,</HI> both very
convenient and strongly defended, but the latter as being some|what
more healthfull, and comming up to the Towne with suf|ficient
water to bear ships of greatest burden, is at this prefect of
greatest imployment; and therefore every day more and more
fortified by the Spaniard. Sir <HI>Iohn Hawkins</HI> in the yeere
1568. came into this Haven, where he found 22. Spanish ships
richly laden, which though he might have certainly seized upon,
yet he condiscendered to meane conditions, whereof the chiefe
was the victualling of his ships; yet neither that nor any of
the other were performed, but they with a new Navy from
<HI>Spaine</HI> falling upon him unexpectedly after agreement made,
put him so to it, as he had much adoe unvictualled, with two
ships onely to escape, and for want of provision was inforced to
set 100 of his men on land who all perished, either by the inhu|manity
of the Savages who killed and eat them, or through the
cruelty of the Spaniard, who to revenge themselves under the
prentence of Religion put them to death.</P>
<P>This large Bishoprick of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> with the Provinces annex|ed
doe (as others) differ much in respect of temperature and fer|tility,
the temperature and fertility arising not so much from
the farther or neerer approach to the Zod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">acke as from the
mountaines and Valleyes, the mountainous parts in many places,
<PB N="46" REF="52">
eight leagues over being temperately cold and lesse fertill; the
Valleyes (whereof here are many) <HI>Achisco</HI> and Saint <HI>Pauls</HI> be|ing
chiefe, exceedingly fruitfull but over hot: I make no que|stion
but that here also are some rich mines, though as yet few
have been discovered. But of this I am well assured, that the
Native Inhabitants are here more then usually to be found in
any place, whose conversion to the true knowledge of Christ,
ought in the first place to be considered by us.</P>
<P>The Spanish Townes of note here (take them as we passe
from East to West) are <HI>Sigura,</HI> and the two Haven Townes (of
which I spake before) all three strongly and statety built, as also
well provided with pleasant and profitable fields round about
them. In the Bishoprick it selfe standeth <HI>Rubla los Angelos,</HI>
the Valley of <HI>Altisco,</HI> inhabited with 1500. Spanish Families
now the chiefe City where the Bishop resideth. 22. leagues
from the Metropolis of <HI>Nova Hispana,</HI> and within a little of
the twentieth degree of North latitude; between which <HI>Mexi|co</HI>
more to the North-west intervene <HI>Guaxacing</HI> and old <HI>Clas|cala,</HI>
from whence all the government hath its name.</P>
<P>And now we are to come unto the heart of <HI>Nova Hispania,</HI>
even to the great City <HI>Mexico,</HI> the center of the Arch-bishoprick
(from whence it is denominated) and upon which government
(under the command of the Victory) all the rest depend. As it
lyeth to the West of <HI>Tlascula,</HI> so it hath to the North the wide
Province of <HI>Panuco,</HI> to the West and North-west <HI>Mecoa|can,</HI>
of as large extent; the length of this Archgovernment is
taken from the Inland confines of <HI>Panuco</HI> to the South-sea,
where it is in bredth but eighteen leagues, though yet to the
North it be reckoned at sixty: In which large tract of ground
there are many petty Provinces, now knowne rather by their
names then Dominions: It may therefore suffice onely to name
them with some small touch of what they have in peculiar.</P>
<P>To the North of it are <HI>Lateotalpa,</HI> wherein lyeth the rich sil|ver
mine of <HI>Puchuca,</HI> fourteen leagues from <HI>Mexico.</HI> Then
<HI>Meslitlan,</HI> a Country abounding with Allum and Iron: Then
<HI>Tula,</HI> whereunto belongeth another silver mine called <HI>Guaxa|na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">o,</HI>
sixty leagues remote; all three well provided of all neces|sary
<PB N="47" REF="52">
provisions for life, and affording many Merchantable Com|modities.</P>
<P>To the North-east the Provinces of <HI>Panpautlat</HI> and <HI>Tup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">dx,</HI>
are neither healthfull, by reason of the excessive heat, nor much
inhabited in regard that lying so levell with the sea, the many
creeks which come from thence maketh the Country adjoyning
barren and unusefull, fit onely to breed innumerable swa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="2 letters">es of
<HI>Musquitos,</HI> a kind of pestilent flyes, which as they are rise in
many other places of the West Indies, so are they here excee|ding
troublesome to the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The lake of <HI>Mexico</HI> in the surrounding bosome whereof the
City standeth to the North, being more then eight leagues in
length, and in most places five in bredth, is on every side well
planted and well inhabited: <HI>Culuala</HI> as is reported consisting of
20000. Families&punc; <HI>Yztacapalpa</HI> of 10000. some others 4 or 5000.
A strong argument to beleeve the regions round about to be ex|ceeding
fertill. Eight leagues to the South of <HI>Mexico</HI> beyond
the lake is <HI>Zalateco,</HI> where is a plantifull silver mine. As are
also <HI>Tasco</HI> 22, and <HI>Zumpango</HI> 40. leagues to the South. Beyond
which yet more to the South, eighty leagues, from the Metro|polis
somewhat above seventeen degrees of North latitude lyeth
<HI>Acapulco,</HI> the most famous port belonging to the South-sea.</P>
<P>Of all <HI>America</HI> concerning the City <HI>Mexico</HI> it self, it may suf|fice
to know that it is the greatest and richest of all this new
World, standing as was formerly noted, upon the North side of
the lake, about the twentieth degree of latitude, and according
to <HI>Herrea</HI> 130. in longitude from the Miridian of <HI>Toledo,</HI> no
lesse then 1740. leagues distant the one from the other, it
consisteth (according to the relation of <HI>Cortesius)</HI> who first con|quered
it) of three streets, whereof the least to the West is a
mile and halfe; a second to the North is three; the greatest to
the South is full two leagues in length, it is credibly reported to
be now inhabited with 4000. Spaniards, and 3000. Natives, a
small proportion in respect of what was formerly related. But
then it is now farre better built and beautified, with a stately
Cathedrall, many Churches, Monasteries and Schooles for lear|ning.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="53">The temperature of this City differeth little from the regions
adjacent, in the moyst moneths annoyed with too much rain, in
the dry (which are November, December, January, February
and March) much more infested with dust, that being raised by
sudden whirlwinds, getteth up into their nostrils and produceth
many diseases, especially Fevers.</P>
<P>There are yet two other things here very observable: First,
that this great City, either through the negligence or avararice
of the Viceroy and his Officers; in not dispending what was
yeerly allowed for repairing the mounds of the lake, was in the
yeer 1629. miserably overflown, to the drowning of many thou|sand
Inhabitants, and to the losse of the greatest and best part
of their houshold-stuffe and other goods, which were either dri|ven
away or corrupted by the waters.</P>
<P>A second thing here to be noted, is that this&punc; last yeere (as it
was constantly reported in <HI>London</HI>) the Viceroy of <HI>Mexico</HI> and
with him all <HI>Nova Hispania</HI> were revolted, and in open Rebel|lion
against the King of <HI>Spaine;</HI> which if it shall (as yet it is ve|rily
beleeved) prove true, it will be of high concernment to this
Nation or any other, into whose hearts it shall please God to put
an effectuall desire of dispossesing the Spaniard of his usurped
stewardship. so unfaithfully imployed (in respect of the fincere
promoting of the Gospell in the purity thereof) and so tyran|nically
exercised, in regard of incredible oppressions, rapines and
murthers there (as their owne Authors confesse) inhumanely
committed by them.</P>
<P>Now for the two other greater Provinces under the com|mand
of <HI>Mexico</HI> government: <HI>Panaco</HI> to the North, the <HI>Me|choacan</HI>
to the South-west: I will briefly set downe so much as is
of any concernment to be knowne.</P>
<P>That part of <HI>Panuco</HI> which is said to be both in length and
bredth fifty leagues; toward the Arch-bishoprick of <HI>Mexico</HI> is
very habitable and fertill, and in times past of great note, for
silver mines (that are now thought to be neere exhausted.) But
the other part which bendeth to the North-east for fifty leagues
to <HI>Florida,</HI> so farre as it is yet discovered, is found overgrowne
with woods, and barren. The Spanish Townes here not greatly
<PB N="49" REF="53">
inhabited beside <HI>Panuco</HI> it selfe (by them called Saint <HI>Steven)</HI>
are Saint <HI>Iago,</HI> 25. leagues to the West, and <HI>Lewis de Tampice,</HI>
eight to the North, not farre from the gulfe of <HI>Mexico.</HI> The
most westerne Province belonging to the <HI>Mexico</HI> government
is <HI>Mecoachan,</HI> lying between <HI>Mexico</HI> and the Provinces of <HI>Ga|laecia,</HI>
bending into the continent towards the North sixty, and
being bounded to the South, by the South-sea full 80. leagues:
whereunto belong the Port towne called <HI>Zacatulca,</HI> thirty
leagues from <HI>Acapulco,</HI> then Saint <HI>Iago</HI> and <HI>Malaccan</HI> 50. more
from thence to the North-west. There are belonging to this
large Province two other little ones <HI>Taximaroa</HI> within 30.
leagues of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and <HI>Colima</HI> to the South-west, upon the
confines of <HI>Galaecia,</HI> 50. leagues from <HI>Valad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">lid</HI> the chiefe City
of <HI>Mecoachan.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Colima</HI> is constantly reported to be very healthfull, apt
for graine and Cattell, but abounding with the choisest fish and
fruit, and not without some gold mines, though it hath more
brasse (which is there so common) that since the Spaniards com|ming
thither, they make all those instruments of brasse that we
usually make of iron. And though this South-west part be the
best of all, yet is there none (unlesse high to the North not yet
so fully discovered) but is as rich, and every way as convenient
to be inhabited.</P>
<P>Besides <HI>Valadolid</HI> (which the Natives call <HI>Guagangareo,</HI> stan|ding
upon a great lake as big as that of <HI>Mexico</HI>) there are many
other Spanish Townes of note. First, <HI>Leon</HI> very famous for the
golden mines that have been found about it. Then <HI>Salaya,</HI> St.
<HI>Miguell</HI> and Saint <HI>Philippo,</HI> up to the North both of <HI>Mexico</HI>
and <HI>Valadolid,</HI> though between them bending still Westward
(all built by the Viceroyet, many league distant the one from
the other) of great use to secure the vast treasute which is con|stantly
conveyed from the most plentifull silver mines of <HI>Elere|ma</HI>
and many other (of which hereafter) against the <HI>Pocacars,</HI> the
most barbarous of all Savages, who live as wild men in Woods,
and cannot as yet be brought under by the Spaniard, though yet
<PB N="50" REF="54">
in hath beene long endeavoured, not without great losse on ei|ther
side.</P>

<P>I Am now come to <HI>Nova Galaecia</HI> to the West of <HI>Mecoacha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI>

<P><HI>Guadalaira</HI> the principall and most Southerne Province of
<HI>Galaecia,</HI> is bounded to the East, with some parts of the Provin|ces
of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Mecoachan,</HI> to the West with <HI>Xalisco;</HI> to
the North with <HI>Zacatecas,</HI> where the most plentifull silver
mines are thought to begin; but of late it is found that about
<HI>Guadaliarae</HI> the chiefe, and indeed the onely Towne here, there
are more plentifull silver mines, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">ere they as the other so well
searched, which for want of men they have not as yet been dis|covered.
And it is further to be observed that this inland Pro|vince
is for temperature and fruitfulnesse in most respects se|cond
to none. <HI>Xalisco</HI> is to the West of <HI>Guadaliara,</HI> upon that
Sea-cost called <HI>Mare Pacificum,</HI> that is, the still sea. The onely
thing of observation here is an herbe, which the Native call
Curcas, highly extolled by <HI>Monardes</HI> the great Herbalist, to be
of singular use against most diseases.</P>
<P><HI>Cametla</HI> likewise lyeth upon the same sea-coast, but a degree
or two higher to the North: The great store of Inhabitants

And <HI>Ybara,</HI> who in the yeere 1554. built Saint <HI>Seba|stian</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="54">
the onely Spanish Towne there, found many silver mines
and of late more have been discovered.</P>
<P><HI>Culacan</HI> a degree more to the North, bending to the West
and coasting upon the foresaid sea, was found out by <HI>Nonnius
Gusmanus,</HI> who Anno 1531. did build a Towne there called
<HI>Del Espar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">u Sancto.</HI> This Province (as the former) is very fruit|full
and rich in silver mines; the women here are reported to
be very comely and beautifull, and to goe modestly attired, a
thing not usuall in these Countryes.</P>
<P><HI>Cinoloa</HI> yet four degrees further to the North, in the full ex|tent
of it towards the West was discovered by the same <HI>Gus|manus;</HI>
but I doe not read of any thing (which after his long
travails and search) was worth his labour: The maritimate places
belonging to these Provinces in North latitude, of no lesse ex|tent
then from the 19. to the 27. degrees, are Cape <HI>de Corientes</HI>
at the turning of the continent, then Port <HI>de Singuiquipa&abque;</HI> up|on
the 22. degree, then Saint <HI>Sebastian</HI> in <HI>Chametla,</HI> Saint
<HI>Miguel</HI> in <HI>Culica,</HI> the Rivers <HI>de Pascua,</HI> and <HI>Petatlan</HI> in <HI>Cina|loa,</HI>
still higher to the North.</P>
<P><HI>Calfornia,</HI> though it be esteemed to be of very large extent,
yet hath it not been as yet discovered. Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> in
his admirably happy voyage, compassing the World, fell upon
it (and was from such Savages as there inhabiting more kindly
entertained then he expected) he took possession thereof in the
name of the Queen of <HI>England:</HI> A good presage, that the most
remote parts being seized upon, the rest shall be possessed by us,
in his good time who is the onely disposer of the earth.</P>
<P>The Inland Provinces <HI>Zacatacas, Topia</HI> and <HI>Nova Biscaya,</HI>
lying between the <HI>Calfornian</HI> sea and the upper part of the gulf
of <HI>Mexico:</HI> Between <HI>Cullacan</HI> and <HI>Panuco,</HI> of the same latitude
upon the Tropicke of <HI>Cancer,</HI> and between <HI>Cinaloa</HI> and the Ri|ver

degree of the North latitude, containe much ground, more rich
then any, in regard of the many silver mines; but yet poorer
then any, in regard of the small sustentation they afford for the
life of man. <HI>Ybara</HI> imployed by <HI>Velascus,</HI> Anno 1554. dis|covered
<PB N="52" REF="55">
in the Province of <HI>Zacatecas,</HI> five exceeding rich silver
Mines; one that is known by the name of the Province, forty
leagues from <HI>Gua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">dalaira;</HI> then those of <HI>Ellerena,</HI> Saint <HI>Mar|tin,
Avinno</HI> and <HI>Dios,</HI> which last being neere to the rising
of the River <HI>Panuco,</HI> at least 100. leauges from the North-sea
is somewhat fertill. The abundant store of treasure taken
forth of these rich mines may be guessed at by the 600. Spani|ards,
who are here continually imployed in digging, and by the
tax of the fifth part, amounting to 50000l. yeerly. The other
mines belonging to <HI>Topia</HI> and <HI>Biscaia, E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="tech" EXTENT="1 letter">dehe, Barbara</HI> and
<HI>Iuan,</HI> afford as much treasure and better provision for life.</P>
<P><HI>Cibola, Quivira</HI> and <HI>Nova Mexico,</HI> three other Provinces, are
yet much more to the North by many degrees. From the most
Southerne parts of <HI>Cibola</HI> to the most Northern of <HI>Nova Mex|ico</HI>
not lesse then fifteen, so as they must needs be of a very large
extent (the longitude being considered with the latitude.) But
the relations of these most Westerne North parts of <HI>America</HI>
are so variously reported and so contradicted, as little can here
be set downe for certaine.</P>
<P>A Fryar <HI>Marke de Niza,</HI> (in a relation to the Viceroy) telleth
wonders concerning the riches, the stately buildings, the most
pleasant inviting habitations in <HI>Cabola:</HI> But <HI>Vasquius de Cor|nado,</HI>
who thereupon was presently sent away to make a further
discovery with 150. horse and 200. foot, finding nothing worth
his great travaile and cost, certified so much to the Viceroy,
with an ample expression of his, and his souldiers detestation of
the Fryars fained relation.</P>
<P><HI>Quivira</HI> (which <HI>Gomara</HI> and <HI>Herrea</HI> likewise place in the
40. degree of the north latitue, is by both said to be barren, and
not much inhabited. The greatest riches here that serve to feed,
and cloth, and carry them, are infinit number of beasts, resem|bling
in regard of their greatnesse, our greatest horse and Oxen,
and their Pels (are said) to afford wool not inferiour to some of
ours.</P>
<P><HI>Nova Mexico</HI> is (as I said) placed yet many degrees more to
the north-west; of which (unlesse I would endeavour to de|lude
<PB N="53" REF="55">
the Reader) to write little or nothing, is to write best. <HI>Gon|salez
de Mendoca</HI> in a little Narrative (Printed at Madrill, <HI>anno
1589.)</HI> maketh a strange relation of what had bin lately per|formed
by one <HI>Augustinus Ruyz</HI> (one of his owne more hol|low,
then holy fraternity) how by his powerfull Preaching to
Savages (not much inferious to his Founder Saint <HI>Francis,</HI> who
is said to Preach to wilde Beasts) converted instantly two great
Provinces of <HI>Nova Mexico, Concht,</HI> and <HI>Tiguria.</HI> But withall
he confesseth that for the killing of a zealous (it might more
truely he said of a foolish over-venturous Fryar amongst men,
who in regard of the knowledge of Christ are but beasts) one
<HI>Anthonius de Espiro,</HI> (I cannot thinke him to be inspired with
any better spirit then that of <HI>The Antichrist of Rome)</HI> made
flaughter of more then forty thousand poore, silly, ignorant
<HI>Indians,</HI> who had never learned to distinguish what their hol|low
Fathers were better then other cruell, mercilesse, <HI>Spa|niards.</HI></P>
<P>He telleth us of many thousands converted to the Christi|an
faith by the Preaching of Fryars (no better inspired then
was the foresaid <HI>Anthonius.)</HI> A strange thing that a few ig|norant
Fryars should doe more in a few dayes, then all their
<HI>Spanish</HI> Clergy did in one hundred and seventy yeeres in pla|ces
farre neerer.</P>
<P>He telleth us also, as doth his brother <HI>de Benavides</HI> (in a
more late Narrative) of the conquering of <HI>Peri, Tebe, Queres,
Tompires,</HI> and many more sained Provinces of <HI>Nova Mexi|co,</HI>
and of the exceeding progresse of the Faith in those parts.
All which&punc; and many more, their incredible expressions are
fit to be cast off, being in all probability but the subtile fictions
of <HI>Spanish</HI> &amp; <HI>Popish</HI> Factors, who (like travellers) take liberty to
lye; and (like Lap-wings) to devert and carry us from those
knowne places as are every way convenient for habitation and

Monarch (who would be of Christendom) that all the reformed
Churches of Christendom, for the present extreamlybleed for it;

and seek to undoe the whole Kingdome, that they may have

<P>But he that dwelleth on high seeth and laugheth their wick|ed

is and shall be my constant prayer to God for these so extream|ly
