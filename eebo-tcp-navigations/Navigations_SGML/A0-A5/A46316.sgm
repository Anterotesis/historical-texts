<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE General having cau&s;ed a <HI>Po&s;t-Office</HI> for to be Erected at <HI>Donohodee</HI> for &s;ending Letters to <HI>England,</HI> by way of <HI>Port-Patrick</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> this comes that way, and is to di&s;&s;charge my promi&s;e (the fir&s;t Oppertunity certain that I had,) to you of what hath occur|red &s;ince our Arrival.</P>
<P>The Garri&s;on of <HI>Carrickfergus,</HI> no &s;ooner &s;aw our Fleet, but they Burnt all their Subburbs: Seized all the <HI>Prote&s;tants</HI> in the place. Made fa&s;t their Gates, and put them&s;elves in a po&s;ture of Defence.</P>
<P>About Three in the Afternoon, <HI>Tue&s;day, Augu&s;t</HI> 13th. the General with that part of the Fleet that was with him put into <HI>Bangor,</HI> on the other &s;ide of the <HI>Lough,</HI> over again&s;t <HI>Carrickfergus;</HI> and that Afternoon Landed all the Soldiers, and forthwith &s;ent Parties to <HI>Killaleigh, Hilsborough, Li&s;&s;negarvey</HI> and <HI>Bellfa&s;t,</HI> in which places they found not one Papi&s;t to re&s;i&s;t them, but all bid|ing them Welcome with &s;uch Pre&s;ents of Food as the Ravenous Papi&s;ts had left them. And this Night the General with the re&s;t, Encamped near <HI>Bangor. Wedne&s;day</HI> 14th. Early in the Morning, his Grace Decamped to <HI>Bellfa&s;t,</HI> and Encamped there until the remainder of the Fleet came to him, which was not until the 19th. And then they Landed their Men at <HI>Bellfa&s;t,</HI> where having Refre&s;hed them&s;elves, on the 21&s;t. they March'd towards <HI>Carrickfergus,</HI> Eight Miles; the General at the &s;ame time ordering the Men of War, which were Seven or Eight to draw up before the Town, and as &s;oon as they &s;aw the Army by Land come before it, to Play on it with their Cannon.</P>
<P>Accordingly about Six in the Afternoon they began, and continued Fireing until the Army had rai&s;ed their Batteries, one upon the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and another on the <HI>North</HI> &s;ide of the Town, where was a va&s;t Number of Hor&s;es, and other Cattle, all which fell into the Soldiers hands as an En|couragement to go further. Capt. <HI>George</HI> of the Lord <HI>Li&s;sburns</HI> Regiment with greate Cou|rage and Bravery, fetch'd off a very Great Booty of Hor&s;es and other Cattle, out of an Orchard under the very Walls. Indeed &s;uch was the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 word"> and Courage of all, that tho&s;e were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span"> were fir&s;t Admitted to places <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="KEYERS" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>
<P>The Batteries being Fini&s;hed, the Cannon and Morters began to Play that Night, and continu|ed Playing until next Morning <HI>viz. Thur&s;day</HI> 22.</P>
<P>When the General for want of a Trumpet, &s;ent Early in the Morning a Drum into the Town, to Demand a Surrender upon Di&s;&s;creti|on, which they Refu&s;ed to do otherwi&s;e then with Bag and Baggage, Mu&s;quer and Sword, Drums Beating, Trumpets Sounding and Col|ours Flying, and a Convoy to Conduct them &s;afe to their own Party.</P>
<P>To which the General returning no An&s;wer; About Eight in the Morning, they &s;ent out an Officer to de&s;ire his Graces Re&s;olutions, to tho&s;e their Peremptory Demands. To which his Grace An&s;wered.</P>
<Q><HI>THat he came hither in the Names, and by Order of their Maje&s;ties, King</HI> William <HI>and Queen</HI> Mary, <HI>to Re&s;tore the Subjects and Laws of this Their Kingdom of</HI> Ireland, <HI>(which had been long Abu&s;ed and Corrupted,) to their due State and Cur|rent. And that pur&s;uant to Their &s;aid Maje&s;ties Natural Inclinations and De&s;ire, to Avoid as much as po&s;&s;ible Effu&s;ion of Chri&s;tian Blood. He, as Their Maje&s;ties General &s;hould do all that in him lay for per|formance thereof: And in Order thereunto A&s;&s;ured them, if they would Surrender without further Trouble, and Swear Feality to Their &s;aid Maje&s;ties, deliver up their Armes and Serviceable Hor&s;es, and what El&s;e they had Taken from the Prote&s;tants; they &s;hould not only have their Lives and Liberties, but Equal Protection to Each of Their Maje&s;ties Pro|te&s;tant Subjects; But if they then Refu&s;ed to Accept tho&s;e Gracious Offers, he had Aquitted him&s;elf of the Blood &s;hould be Spilt, could not afterwards Grant them the like Terms, but would Endeavour to Reduce them by Force of Arms.</HI></Q>
<P>And accordingly they Refu&s;ed the&s;e Terms; the General Ordered the Cannon, Bombs and &s;mall Shot forthwith to play again upon them, which they did without Intermi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Parley aforementioned, was no &s;ooner over, but there came into the Camp 500 Hor&s;e from <HI>Enniskilling,</HI> &s;ome without Boots and Pi&s;t|ols, others with Pi&s;tols but without Carabines, &s;ome with one Pi&s;tol and a Carabine without a Sword, others without all, with only a Fowl|ing Peice or Fire-lock, mo&s;t of their Hor&s;es &s;mall and poor, yet &s;uch have been the Courage and Actions of the&s;e Men as is &s;carce Credible, e&s;pecially (of which you have heard e're this) the Routing 3000 under <HI>Maccarty,</HI> Takeing him
<PB REF="2">Pri&s;oner, and Killing double their ow Number: The&s;e brave Men the General made Welcome, and will &s;oon be better Arm'd and Accoutred.</P>
<P>In the Evening I March'd into the Camp; and through the Whole, and found the Lord <HI>Li&s;s|burns,</HI> and a <HI>French</HI> Regiment Marching with Faggots, Shovels, Pick-Ax's, and &s;uch other Implements, be&s;ides their Arms, to Releive Two other Regiments in the Trenches. The Ge|neral him&s;elf until Twelve at Night, was Marching up and down in Per&s;on, giving Ne|ce&s;&s;ary Orders, and going even to the Batteries, and no more Concern'd at the Enemies Bullets Humming and Whizing about his Ears, then if it had been Mu&s;ick of Peace.</P>
<P>I &s;aw my &s;elf &s;everal of the Enemies Bullets fall clo&s;e by him, and went even into the Tren|ches.</P>
<P>I &s;taid in the Camp all Night, to plea&s;e my Eies and Ears with the Sight and Noi&s;e of our Bombs, Cannon, and &s;mall Shot, which conti|nually plaid on the Town, like ince&s;&s;ant Showers of Hail, with which they beat down the Gate on the North &s;ide of the Town, and great part of the Wall adjoyning, and much of the Half|moon by the Ca&s;tle, and as a Drummer, and others, who &s;tole out, &s;aid killed their principal Gunner, by di&s;mounting a peece of Cannon up|on him, while he was levelling at our Battery on the Half-moon, and about a Hundred others; much damnifying the Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>About 5 next Morning (<HI>Aug.</HI> 23.) I returned to <HI>Bellfa&s;t,</HI> and find that a Prote&s;tant may alrea|dy &s;afely, and without any Danger, march throughout the whole Province of <HI>&V;l&s;ter,</HI> which is one fourth part of the Kingdom, with only a Stick in his hand, not a Papi&s;t being any where to be found in it, except about 2000, who are fled to the <HI>Red Glin,</HI> between the Mountains, a|bout Twenty miles Northward of this place, for fear of being di&s;poild by the Prote&s;tants (who they have &s;o &s;erved already:) They have few or nor Arms, except half Pikes and Skeanes, with which they hoped to &s;ecure them&s;elves from the Violence of the Country people, until they can procure pardon and protection; which I am told the Gederal is about ordering for them.</P>
<P>To our great Surprize, and no le&s;s Joy, we found the whole Country full of Corn, and all manner of Provi&s;ion, who&s;e plenty you may gue&s;s at by the following Table of Rates &s;et up at the Market-Cro&s;s of this place, and the which is &s;o &s;atisfactory that while I was Tran&s;cribing it I hard the Sellor &s;ay, it was enough in all con&s;ci|ence, and almo&s;t double what they got before our Landing. <HI>Vera Capie</HI> follows</P>
<P><HI>Rates fet upon Goods and &V;ictuals to be &s;old in the Camp, before</HI> Carrickfergus; <HI>and all other places hereabouts.</HI></P>
