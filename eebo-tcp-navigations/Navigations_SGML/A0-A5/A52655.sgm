<HEAD>A Narrative of the Succe&s;s of the voyage of his Excellency the Lord <HI>Heneage Finch,</HI> from <HI>Smyrna</HI> to <HI>Con&s;tantinople;</HI> his arrival there, the manner of his entrance into <HI>Pera,</HI> and of his audience with the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> and <HI>Grand Seignior.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_ON the &s;ixt day of <HI>January,</HI> early in the morn|ing, returning aboard with our own Com|pany, and &s;ix Merchants appointed by the Factory of <HI>Smyrna</HI> to attend us; we &s;et &s;ail immediately with the wind at Ea&s;t, having the <HI>Smyrna</HI> Factour and the Catch in our Company, which arrived with us on New years day. As &s;oon as we had &s;ailed without the command of the Ca&s;tle, it became totally calm, without the lea&s;t breez or breath of air, which enforced us to ca&s;t our Anchour, and expect untill a fa|vourable or a brisker gale did pre&s;ent: The next day a flat|tering air from the &s;hore at South-ea&s;t, per&s;waded us to weigh our anchours, and &s;et our &s;ails; but this continued no longer than it had brought us out of the Lands protection, and had
<PB N="2" REF="3">expo&s;ed us to our own arts and the &s;trength of our ve&s;&s;el, to encounter with tho&s;e many &s;hocks and violences of a &s;torm which &s;uddenly en&s;ued: for in a moment the wind altered, coming about to the North-ea&s;t, &s;o that with a &s;trong gale we weathered the Cape <HI>Caliberno,</HI> and &s;tanding for the I&s;land of <HI>Mitylene,</HI> we intended under the &s;helter of that Land to &s;pend our tedious time of the following night. Our Ship lying a drift under her main cour&s;e and fore-&s;ail by the ma&s;t, the &s;torm by degrees more violently increa&s;ed, that by the morning it was become compleat in all points of its growth and terrour; the Sea was all in a breach, the skie was black and thick, the Sun &s;o lowring and red, &s;ignified the continu|ance of it: the &s;pray of the Sea &s;o forcibly carried by the wind over the Ship, that Ma&s;ts, Yards, and Decks, were cove|red with a white &s;alt. This extremity of weather made us think of &s;ome port or harbour to &s;ecure our Ship. The I&s;land of <HI>Ip&s;era</HI> lying South-ea&s;t eight leagues from <HI>Mitylene,</HI> was &s;uppo&s;ed by our Ma&s;ter a &s;afe place to &s;pend the fury of the &s;torm, as having formerly afforded him a kinder entertainment and defence upon the like occa&s;ion of di&s;tre&s;&s;e and fury: Thus &s;teering for this Port, our main &s;ails in the brails and our fore|&s;ail &s;et, it was like paper blown away; and bringing another to the yard, it had the misfortune to be foul of the flook of the anchour, and &s;o became as un&s;erviceable as the other: Being thus deprived of the benefit of our commanding &s;ails, we &s;et up our &s;prit-&s;ail and main cour&s;e, &s;teering in between the I|&s;land <HI>Ip&s;era</HI> the greater and the le&s;&s;e, where keeping too near aloof towards the &s;hore, we unfortunately &s;truck upon a rock, which a&s;toni&s;hed us all with a &s;trange amazement; the poor Ship &s;truck five times, endeavouring to clear her &s;elf from a totall wrack and ruine, which all of us began to de&s;pair of; and with ca&s;t up eyes, and &s;tretched out arms, thought now of no other but of our la&s;t and final port: And yet in the mid&s;t of this horrid con&s;ternation and di&s;tre&s;&s;e, it plea&s;ed God, who was our be&s;t Pilot, to bring us clear from our rock, with &s;ome, though (as we hope) with little dammage to our Ship.
<PB N="3" REF="3">An e&s;cape &s;o miraculous and wonderfull, con&s;idering the vio|lence of the &s;torm, the carere and weight of our Ship, as ought to make the 8. day of <HI>January</HI> for ever to be recorded by us to admiration, and anniver&s;ary thankfulne&s;&s;e for God's provi|dence and protection: The Ship having thus depth of water again, and come into a place of &s;ome convenient anchourage, our fir&s;t anchour not holding us, we let fall our &s;heet anchour, the <HI>Smyrna</HI> Factour following us. The Catch being again &s;e|parated by the night's tempe&s;t, came not to anchour, and fearing that being not furni&s;hed with &s;o good ground-tackle as we, &s;he was not able to endure and ride out &s;o exce&s;&s;ive a gale; the 8. &amp; 9 day &amp; night the wind continued &s;till violent; the 10 it be|gan to abate, &s;o that we could &s;end a&s;hore, and enjoy &s;ome kind of &s;atisfaction, though detained with a contrary wind: The greate&s;t part of the 12. day proved with little wind, and the 13. a calm, the 14. day between one and two of the clock in the morning, the wind &s;prung out of the We&s;t South-we&s;t with an ea&s;ie gale, with which we weighed our anchour and put to the Sea, the wind &s;till continuing favourable and gentle; and the 15. early we came to the I&s;land of <HI>Tenedos,</HI> and &s;oon after entring the <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI> pa&s;&s;ing the new Ca&s;tles, from that on the A&s;ian &s;ide came off a boat &s;ent by the Captain of the Ca&s;tle, &s;ignifying the day before that he had received advice from the <HI>Vizier</HI> that we were&s;uddenly to arrive, and that both for our &s;elves and Ships that accompanied us, free pa&s;&s;age &s;hould be given without any hinderance or mole&s;tation: pa&s;|&s;ing further up the River about five leagues, being about three of the clock in the afternoon of the &s;ame day, we came up to the Ca&s;tles of <HI>Se&s;tos</HI> and <HI>Abydos:</HI> from the latter, being on the Natolian &s;hore, came off a boat with a <HI>Janizarie</HI> and <HI>Drugerman,</HI> to welcome us with Letters from Sir <HI>Thomas Bendi&s;h,</HI> and to return with news of our &s;afe arrival: The night following, and likewi&s;e the 16. day continued there a gentle and favourable gale; &s;o that pa&s;&s;ing the I&s;land of <HI>Mar|mora</HI> (about noon of the &s;ame day) &s;cituate at the entrance of the Propontick Sea, formerly called <HI>Proconne&s;us,</HI> we plea&s;antly
<PB N="4" REF="4">pa&s;&s;ed forward that night, and on the 27. day, being that day three moneths &s;ince we embarqued in the Downs, we came to an anchor for &s;ome few hours near the &s;even Towers, until &s;uch time as Sir <HI>Thomas Bendi&s;h</HI> could receive notice of our arrival. And thus giving time for that intelligence, the anchour was again weighed, and we &s;tood in for the Port with a fre&s;h gale. Notice being given, that the <HI>Grond Seignior</HI> was &s;eated in a Summer-hou&s;e on the corner wall of the <HI>Seraglio:</HI> our Flaggs and En&s;igns were di&s;played, our Cuns and Wa&s;tcloths out; and being oppo&s;ite to the point of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> a <HI>Bostangee,</HI> or one belonging to the Gardens of the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> came aboard to acquaint us, that the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI>'s plea&s;ure was that we &s;hould rejoyce with Guns, (for that was his expre&s;&s;ion) after which were fired 61 Guns, and &s;o came to an anchor on <HI>Topa|na</HI> &s;ide, where we received Sir <HI>Thomas Bendi&s;h</HI> aboard, congra|tulating our &s;afe arrival. Again&s;t next day things were pro|vided for our entrance, being the 18. day; and indeed with that hand&s;ome State and Equipage, that I believe none of his Predece&s;&s;ours, nor yet the Emperours Amba&s;&s;adours, can boa&s;t of a more honourable, nor a more noble reception. The <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> &s;ent &s;everal of his officers to attend and re|ceive him at his fir&s;t landing; and the multitude of people that flocked from all parts, made the bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of more wonder and expectation. A&s;&s;oon as we de&s;cended from the Ship into the boat de&s;igned to carry us a&s;hore, the Ship fired 51. Guns, with that deliberation, and &s;o lei&s;urely, as continued until his landing; where being met by his own Servants, the Merchants of the place, and tho&s;e brought with us from <HI>Smyrna;</HI> with the Officers of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> my Lord's Hor&s;e being co|vered with a Crim&s;on velvet foot-cloth richly laced, and being mounted thereupon, and his Ladie in the Coach, we marched in this order.</P>

<P>As we marched all the &s;treets were crowded with people, and the windows with &s;pectatours, as being unu&s;ual in this Coun|crey to &s;ee a Chri&s;tian Amba&s;&s;adour attended with &s;o many Turki&s;h Officers. The pre&s;&s;e was al&s;o the more augmented, and the pa&s;&s;age ob&s;tructed, by ca&s;ting 550. five foll. pieces, which My Lord commanded to be di&s;po&s;ed of among&s;t the people. And thus being arrived at his hou&s;e at <HI>Pera,</HI> he was immediate|ly &s;aluted by the Secretary of the Emperours Re&s;ident, in behalf of his Ma&s;ter; and &s;oon after by the Secretary of the <HI>Excellen|ti&s;&s;imo Ballarino,</HI> and <HI>Capello,</HI> who negotiate the affairs of the Venetian Republique, and the next day by a me&s;&s;enger of the French Amba&s;&s;adours, and Dutch Agent. On that day the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> &s;ent him a pre&s;ent of ten &s;heep, and fifty hens, a hundred loaves of bread, twenty &s;ugar loaves, twenty wax candles, a favour extraordinary, not u&s;ually conferred on any Amba&s;&s;adour. On the 20. day of this moneth he had audience of the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> and being attended thither with the &s;ame &s;olemnity as at his fir&s;t entrance; onely that untill he came unto <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> &s;ide. He had not the attendance of <HI>Chaus Ba&s;&s;a</HI> who met him on the other &s;ide of the water, and thence conducted him to his <HI>Viziers</HI> pallace: At his fir&s;t en|trance he was led in between two of his Gentlemen, very few of his retinue being &s;uffered to follow him into the pre&s;ence of the <HI>Vizier,</HI> who &s;ate in a little room upon Cu&s;hions and his feet covered, a fire in the room, and upon a Sapha were &s;e|veral
<PB N="6" REF="5"><HI>Ba&s;haws</HI> and <HI>Chau&s;es</HI> &s;tanding by him: Two Crim&s;on Velvet &s;tools were fetched out; one for my Lord, and the other for Sir <HI>Thomas Bendi&s;h,</HI> on which being &s;ate, he pre&s;ented the Kings Letter to the <HI>Vizier</HI> by the hand of the Chancellor, who was there pre&s;ent by him; the Letters were wrote on parch|ment, and put in a bagg made of cloth of Gold. As &s;oon as they were delivered, my Lord <HI>Bendi&s;h</HI> began to inform the <HI>Vi|zier,</HI> that this was that honourable per&s;on he had formerly ac|quainted him was coming Amba&s;&s;adour; rhat he was of that Nobility and Alliance to the King, that had not his Maje&s;tie highly and in an extraordinary manner intended to honour the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> he would not have expo&s;ed his kin&s;man to &s;o long &amp; dangerous a voyage. Then my Lord began to tell him the Re&s;tauration of the King, of his greatne&s;s and power, of his Clemency in pardoning all but &s;uch as were engaged in the bloud of his Father; That in his pa&s;&s;age to this place, he had by the command of the King touched at <HI>Algier,</HI> endeavouring to renew the former articles of peace, and to relea&s;e an Engli&s;h Lord which was there a captive, en&s;laved contrary to the a|greement of peace, but was foiled in the Treaty, and could re|duce them to nothing of rea&s;on or ju&s;tice, and therefore de|&s;ired to know of the <HI>Vizier</HI> what &s;hould be done in this ca&s;e. To which he replied, that he would have a care of it, and &s;ee to do him ju&s;tice: My Lord further a&s;&s;ured him of the friend&s;hip that the King his Ma&s;ter de&s;ired to pre&s;erve with the <HI>Grand Seignior;</HI> and therefore de&s;iring to honour him, hath &s;ent him his fir&s;t Amba&s;&s;ador to &s;alute him, before he had appointed or de&s;igned any for the Chri&s;tian Princes: To which the <HI>Vizier</HI> proudly replied, that that was but rea&s;on, &s;ince the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> was an Emperour and they but Kings, and he the greate&s;t &amp; mo&s;t Soveraign Potentate of the world. He fur|ther told him, that being now come upon a bu&s;ine&s;s of Cere|mony and Complement, he could not in&s;i&s;t upon much bu&s;ine&s;s whereby to over burthen him with a tedious di&s;cour&s;e, but &s;hould referre that to be intimated to him by his Drugerman, at &s;ome other convenient time of Treaty and di&s;cour&s;e. This
<PB N="7" REF="5">being pa&s;&s;ed, two bowls of <HI>Sherbet</HI> were brought forth, which we drunk one to another, but not the Turks. This being done, the Engli&s;h pre&s;ent was brought forth and laid before the <HI>Vi|zier,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of twenty Ve&s;ts, four of them being of fine Engli&s;h cloth of &s;everal colours, four Velvet, of &s;everal flow|red Stuffs of gold and &s;ilver four, of watered Tabbies four, of &s;everal Sattins worked gaudy and gay after the Turki&s;h fa&s;hi|on. In recompence we received thanks, and my Lord him&s;elf with Sir <HI>Thomas Bendi&s;h,</HI> and &s;ix of tho&s;e that attended were ve&s;ted; which ve&s;ts had nothing of value more, then that they came from the <HI>Vizier,</HI> as u&s;ual Liveries and Badges of their favours. After this my Lord departed, wearing this paint|ed ve&s;t untill he came without the gates of the Pallace, and then delivered it to the hands of his Page, and &s;o likewi&s;e did tho&s;e that followed him to their Servants; and thus in the &s;ame manner returned back again to his hou&s;e at <HI>Pera,</HI> with an ap|pearance of fair corre&s;pondencie of a maintainance of the former Capitulations, with an amendment of the afore pa&s;&s;ed abu&s;es.</P>
<P>On the 26. <HI>Feb.</HI> my Lord had audience of the <HI>Gr. Seignior,</HI> which was purpo&s;ely deferred until that day of payment of the Janizaries, that &s;o the Amba&s;&s;adour might &s;ee more than an u&s;ual &s;olemnity, and make a good report in his own Countrey of the glory and magnificence of the <HI>Ottoman</HI> Emperours. We being attended as formerly when he had audience of the <HI>Vizier,</HI> he departed from his hou&s;e upon the fir&s;t break of day, and ha|ving pa&s;&s;ed the water, was on <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> &s;ide met by the Chou&s;e Ba&s;&s;aw and his Chou&s;es, which conducted us to the <HI>Seraglio,</HI> where being entred, and riding through the fir&s;t &s;pa|cious Court we alighted from our hor&s;es, and walked through another Court untill we came to the <HI>Divan,</HI> where at the upper end was placed the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> on his right hand were five other <HI>Viziers,</HI> of which the Captain Ba&s;haw was one, on his left hand were the two Judges or Chief Ju&s;tices, one of which wore a great Turbant of green, being of the family and kin|dred of the Prophet; near to whom was placed the Toftardar,
<PB N="8" REF="6">or Lord Trea&s;urer, with three other Ba&s;haws, being under Trea&s;urers. The floor of the Divan was &s;pread with Carpets, and on them a rich covering of bags of money to pay the Soul|diery, there being in all an hundred and fifty heaps, every one of which con&s;i&s;ted of ten pur&s;es, and every pur&s;e five hun|dred dollers, &s;o that the &s;umme by computation amounted to an hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds. Being come to the door of the <HI>Divan,</HI> none were admitted in be&s;ides my Lord, Sir <HI>Thomas Bendi&s;h,</HI> and about &s;ix or &s;even more; being entred, Sir <HI>Thomas Bendi&s;h</HI> and my Lord approched towards the <HI>Vi|zier,</HI> others remaining at the lower end of the room; where for them were &s;et two &s;mall red Velvet Stools, on which being &s;et, there pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e of kindne&s;&s;e and civility, which being done, they retired to another part of the room: In the mean while the payment of the Souldiers went forward; eve|ry Colonel and Captain receiving the pay of his Regiment and company, which having done, every one of them came up to the <HI>Vizier</HI> and ki&s;&s;ed the hemme of his ve&s;t on his knees, and &s;o retired with great humility, making ha&s;te away from him, pa&s;&s;ing with one &s;ide towards him, &s;o as not to turn his back: The payment being over, three &s;mall Tables were brought in (the <HI>Grand vizier</HI> retiring by rea&s;on of his indi|&s;po&s;ition of body) on which were &s;et a large capacious Voider for a Table; that on which they dined being of &s;ilver oar, other of mixed metal: Being &s;et at the&s;e Tables, their meat was &s;erved in one di&s;h after another, where they had no knives laid for them to cut: for &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;harpne&s;s of their &s;tomacks would make amends for the want of knives, they fell too after the Turki&s;h fa&s;hion and tore it in pieces; but &s;carce was any di&s;h upon the table, &s;ometimes almo&s;t before they had ta&s;ted it. but immediately was &s;natched off, and another &s;et in his place; having thus &s;uperficially proved every di&s;h, of which there was about two Cour&s;es, the Table was taken away, and the Chou&s;e Ba&s;haw advi&s;ed them to accompany him, where they &s;hould re|ceive the Honour of the <HI>Grand Seigniors</HI> Ve&s;ts, according to the u&s;ual cu&s;tome upon like occa&s;ions. Eighteen Ve&s;ts were be|&s;towed,
<PB N="9" REF="6">and one more above the number, as a mark of more honour and favour: While&s;t this was doing, the pre&s;ent made to the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> by the Turkey Company was di&s;played in open Court, con&s;i&s;ting of fifty Ve&s;ts, ten being of Velvet, ten of Sattin, ten of Cloth of Gold, ten of Tabbies, ten of fine Engli&s;h cloth; every one of which Ve&s;ts was held by a &s;e|veral per&s;on, &s;o that fifty men were rancked in order for the better appearance, and four Engli&s;h Ma&s;tiffs were al&s;o given as an addition to the Pre&s;ent. In this Court were al&s;o drawn up the whole body of the Janizaries that were then paid, con|&s;i&s;ting of five thou&s;and men, among&s;t whom there was that &s;ilence, that not one whi&s;per or noi&s;e, or the lea&s;t motion was under&s;tood: And as the Janizaries Aga and other Com|manders pa&s;&s;ed, the bowing and &s;alutations that they made were al&s;o regular at the &s;ame time, as may well te&s;tifie the ex|actne&s;&s;e of the Di&s;cipline and admirable obedience, which hath been the &s;ole cau&s;e of their Conque&s;t and enlargement of their Empire. Being thus ve&s;ted, and the <HI>Grand Vizier</HI> gone into the pre&s;ence of the <HI>Grand Seignior,</HI> to whom we bowed as he pa&s;&s;ed, two Cappagee Ba&s;haws with Silver &s;taves con|ducted him to the Audience, none being permitted to follow him, but Sir <HI>Thomas Bendi&s;h,</HI> his Brother the Drugerman, the Captain of the Ship, the Trea&s;urer, and his Secretary, who car|ried the Cloth of Cold bagg, in which were the Kings Letters. The Gate we fir&s;t entred was &s;et vvide open, vvithin it vvas paved vvith vvhite Marble, vvhere attended &s;ome fourty Eu|nuchs, all clothed vvith divers Colours of &s;ilk and Sattin Ve&s;ts, coming near the Pre&s;ence door, vve made a &s;tand in the Porch, vvhere runnes a plea&s;ant Fountain of vvater, and trode very &s;oftly, &s;o as not to di&s;turb vvith the lea&s;t motion that great Maje&s;ty, vvhere vvas &s;o profound a &s;ilence, that no|thing vvas heard more than the murmuring of the Fountain: Ju&s;t at the Entrance hung a Ball of gold &s;tudded vvith Dia|monds and precious &s;tones, and about it great Chains of rich Peail. The Chamber vvhere the <HI>Grand Seignior</HI> &s;ate, vvas covered vvith a Carpet of Crim&s;on Velvet, and embroidered
<PB N="10" REF="7">vvith Gold vvire; and &s;o likevvi&s;e vvas an open Gallery be|fore the Entrance, through vvhich vve fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ed, and many of them be&s;et vvith &s;mall &s;eed-pearl. The <HI>Grand Seigntor</HI> him&s;elf &s;ate in a Throne rai&s;ed a &s;mall heighth from the ground, &s;upported vvith four pillars plated vvith Gold, from the top hung great Balls of ma&s;&s;ie and vveighty Gold: The Cu&s;hions he &s;ate upon, and tho&s;e al&s;o that lay by, and the Carpets &s;pread upon the Throne were all be&s;et vvith Jevvels; on his Right hand &s;tood the <HI>Grand Vizier,</HI> the tvvo Cappagee Ba&s;havvs took him by each hand and brought him into the Pre&s;ence, about the middle of the room, laying their hands upon his head, made him bovv untill he had almo&s;t touched the Carpets vvith his fore-head, and then rai&s;ing him again, they retired vvith him backvvard unto the furthe&s;t part of the room; in like manner they did unto the re&s;t of his company. The Kings Letters being pre&s;ented, they vvere appointed to be carried to the Lord Chancellour, and the Drugerman by his order in the Turki&s;h Language, read in his Paper to this ef|fect.
