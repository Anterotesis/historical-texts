<HEAD>A RELATION Concerning the Particulars of the Re|bellion lately rai&s;ed in <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> by <HI>Stenko Razin.</HI></HEAD>
<P>_THere are two &s;orts of <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> &s;ome are call'd <HI>Saporogsky,</HI> and others <HI>Donsky.</HI> The former do from antient times belong to the Dominions of the King of <HI>Poland,</HI> and have their ordinary abode in the I&s;les of the River <HI>Bory&s;thenes</HI> or <HI>Nieper.</HI> At a good di&s;tance from the Town <HI>Kiof,</HI> in the &s;ame River, is to be found a Rock, from which the Water falling with great violence, maketh above Fifty I&s;les; and this Rock, whence the Water falls, is called <HI>Poroch,</HI> and giveth to tho&s;e <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> which are &s;eated in tho&s;e I&s;les that lie behinde the <HI>Poroch,</HI> the name of <HI>Saporogsky.</HI> Their bu&s;ine&s;s is, to be watchful again&s;t the Incur&s;ions of the <HI>Tartars,</HI> and other enemies of the Kingdom of <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>The Name of <HI>Co&s;ack</HI> is &s;aid to be derived from the <HI>Sclavonian</HI> word <HI>Co&s;a,</HI> which &s;ignifieth <HI>Spirit;</HI> and it is thought, that that name was given to that people by rea&s;on of their Agility or Nimblene&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>Donsky-Co&s;acks</HI> are tho&s;e that have their habi|tation upon the famous River <HI>Don,</HI> antiently called
<PB N="4" REF="5"><HI>Tanais,</HI> and belong to the Czar or Emperor of <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> and <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> to whom they yield a voluntary, rather than a compelled obedience. They are by the &s;aid Czar endowed with many Priviledges, enjoying their own Laws, and chu&s;ing their own Governor. They have &s;o great Priviledges, that if any Slave run away from a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> Nobleman or other great Per&s;on, and come unto the&s;e <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> the Proprietors loo&s;e their claim to them.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e <HI>Donsky-Co&s;acks</HI> was <HI>Stenko Razin,</HI> the Per|&s;on that four years &s;ince ro&s;e up in Rebellion again&s;t the great Czar <HI>Alexis Michalowitz.</HI> The rea&s;on or rather pretence of that In&s;urrection was, the death of the &s;aid <HI>Razin</HI>'s Brother, inflicted by the Bojar <HI>Kneas Jurge Dolgeroek.</HI> For in the year 1665. he was with an Army in the Field, about the Town <HI>Kiof,</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Polanders,</HI> having under him, among others, a Troup of <HI>Donsky-Co&s;acks.</HI> Autumn being come in, and that Troup e&s;teeming to have done good &s;ervice again&s;t the enemy, de&s;ired to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed by the &s;aid Com|mander <HI>Dolgeroek,</HI> who po&s;&s;ibly &s;tanding yet in need of their &s;ervice, would not con&s;ent to it. Where|upon the&s;e <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> unwilling to hearken to the com|mand of their General; but following the per&s;wa&s;i|ons and example of their chief Officer, which was the Brother of <HI>Stenko Razin,</HI> did disband, and went every one to his home. <HI>Dolgeroek</HI> being extreamly offended thereat, gave order, that this Ring-Leader &s;hould be taken; which being done, he commanded him pre&s;ently to be hanged.</P>
<P>This is the cau&s;e, pretended by <HI>Razin,</HI> when he was upon the Rack, of his rai&s;ing this Rebellion, to re|venge the death of his Brother, innocently executed,
<PB N="5" REF="5">as he under&s;tood it. But that this was but a meer pre|text, is &s;ufficiently apparent, in regard that this In&s;ur|rection was made not onely again&s;t the Czar, but al&s;o again&s;t the King of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> from whom he never could alledge to have received any injury. So that nothing but his malicious, and rebellious temper, hath impel|led him to this infamous undertaking.</P>
<P>The beginning of his villanous attempt was, his robbery upon the River <HI>Volga, An.</HI> 1667, where he took &s;everal great Boats laden with Commodities, belonging partly to Cloi&s;ters and Eccle&s;ia&s;ticks, part|ly to private Merchants of <HI>Jere&s;laf, Wologda,</HI> and other places. Thence he went to the Town <HI>Jayck,</HI> which he took by force, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his <HI>Co&s;acks.</HI> Soon after he proceeded to the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea;</HI> and from thence he returned to the <HI>Volga,</HI> where he did great mi&s;chief in giving interruption to Fi&s;hing, and in ruining many Hou&s;es. Thence he marched to the Town <HI>Teock,</HI> and further to the Frontiers of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> where he did great damage to the Subjects, both of the great Czar of <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> and the Chach of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI> The Inhabitants of a certain &s;mall <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Town, be|ing informed of his approach, betook them&s;elves to a Neighboring Fort for &s;ecurity. Whereupon <HI>Stenko</HI> &s;ent them word, that they had no rea&s;on to fear, and invited them to return, a&s;&s;uring them, That he and his Men were not come to do them any hurt, but for Money to buy Provi&s;ion, and other Nece&s;&s;aries for his Troups. They came back with great confidence to their Town, and opened their Shops, where <HI>Stenko</HI> and his Soldiers bought what they needed, and paid for what they bought that time; but afterwards he gave a &s;ign to his <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> that pa&s;&s;ing over the Market|place,
<PB N="6" REF="6">when he &s;hould put his Cap into a certain po&s;ture, they &s;hould fall upon and kill all the Inhabi|tants; which was executed accordingly, and practi|&s;ed in &s;everal other places upon the Borders of <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;top the&s;e cruel actions, the <HI>Kneas Jwan Simo|newitz,</HI> then Waywode or Governor of <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> &s;ent &s;ome Troups again&s;t him. Whereupon <HI>Stenko,</HI> finding him&s;elf too weak, and apprehending a bad i&s;&s;ue, asked pardon; to which, the &s;aid Governor returned this an|&s;wer, That if he would de&s;i&s;t from his violence and robbery, he doubted not but the great Czar would &s;hew him Mercy. He came with his companions to <HI>Astracan,</HI> almo&s;t all &s;ick and &s;welled, becau&s;e having been a little before, upon a certain I&s;land in the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea,</HI> be&s;et by the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> they had been nece&s;&s;itated to drink Salt-water. And he at length received par|don from the Czar for his crimes, and promi&s;ed, That he and his Company would henceforth &s;erve him with all faithfulne&s;s, nor exerci&s;e any robbery on the <HI>Volga,</HI> or the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea,</HI> or el&s;where.</P>
<P><HI>Stenko</HI> being recovered, &s;hewed his genero&s;ity to the Inhabitants of <HI>Astracan.</HI> For as he was walking thorough the Streets, he &s;cattered among the people &s;tore of Ducats and other Coyn he had robbed, and thereby was applauded by all; which then &s;ufficiently manife&s;ted his aim. And &s;o he, with his a&s;&s;ociates, went away to their own Countrey about the River <HI>Don;</HI> where he began to act afre&s;h his villainy in Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical Matters, driving away many Prie&s;ts, and hindring Divine Service, and intruding him&s;elf into Church affairs. For a pattern of the glorious Cere|monies, which this <HI>Co&s;ack-Pope</HI> introduced, take this,
<PB N="7" REF="6">that in&s;tead of the u&s;ual Ceremonies of Marriage per|formed by the Prie&s;ts in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> he made the contract|ed couple to goe &s;everal times round about a Tree dancing, and thus they were married after <HI>Stenko</HI>'s mode. He al&s;o ca&s;t out bla&s;phemous words again&s;t the Saviour of the World; and &s;crupled not forth|with to break that Oath of Fidelity, which a little be|fore he had &s;worn to the Great Czar; and put to death divers ancient Co&s;&s;acks, that had more integri|ty than to combine with him in his rebellion. The like he acted upon the Waywode of the &s;ame place, and up|on tho&s;e that had been &s;ent by the Czar with Letters of Grace and Pardon, and others.</P>
<P>From the River <HI>Don</HI> he return'd to the <HI>Volga,</HI> toge|ther with his A&s;&s;ociats, and came to the Town <HI>Saret|za,</HI> where he per&s;waded the Inhabitants, that the Ar|my of the Great Czar was at hand to put them all to death; whereas on the contrary that Army was come to a&s;&s;i&s;t them again&s;t <HI>Stenko:</HI> and thus the Town was &s;urrendred to him; and he having made his en|try, killed the Commander and all the Citizens that refu&s;ed to joyn with him. He marched out again to meet the Army of the Czar; which he defeated, ta|king and putting to death the General, with many o|thers. He took al&s;o the Town <HI>Sionejaer;</HI> where he put to the Sword the Governour, all the Officers, and many Mu&s;covian &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>Thence he marched to the City of <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> &s;eated at the mouth of the River <HI>Volga,</HI> not far from the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea,</HI> walled about, and having in compa&s;s more than two miles. The Suburbs lying round about it, are mo&s;t of them bare, and expo&s;ed to the incur&s;ion of any Enemy. Some years &s;ince was this
<PB N="8" REF="7">Town po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Tartars, from whom it was ta|ken by the Czar <HI>Jwan Wa&s;elowitz, An.</HI> 1553. About it grows no Grain at all, but 'tis provided from above. It is rich chiefly in Salt and Fi&s;h; the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea</HI> fur|ni&s;hing the people, living on that &s;hore, with &s;tore of Salt water, of which they make whole mountains of Salt. And the <HI>Volga</HI> about <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> abounds in Fi&s;h above all Rivers. There they catch tho&s;e great Fi&s;hes, <HI>O&s;&s;otrina, Belouga,</HI> &s;ome of the latter being three fa|thoms long, one of which can hardly be carried by thirty men. In <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> is great Commerce, managed by forrain Nations, Per&s;ians, Indians, Boucharen, Ar|menians, and others, it hath for its ordinary Gari&s;on Twelve thou&s;and Soldiers. <HI>Stenko Razin</HI> coming to this City, &s;ent &s;ome of his Co&s;&s;acks into it, to &s;tirre up the Soldiers again&s;t the Governor; which wrought &s;o well, that it was concluded the Town &s;hould be deliver'd to him, and he received into it: which was executed according to his wi&s;h.</P>
<P><HI>Kneas Jwan Semenof Pro&s;orofskie,</HI> being at Church, in the mid&s;t of Divine Service was thence pull'd away, and made to goe up that high &s;quare Steeple, which &s;tands in the mid&s;t of the Ca&s;tle of <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> for a Beacon to direct tho&s;e that Navigate the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea,</HI> or travel in the va&s;t and little frequented fields called <HI>Steep.</HI> From this Steeple the &s;aid Governor was ca&s;t down head-long. 'Tis &s;aid, that <HI>Stenko</HI> a little before whi&s;per'd him &s;omething in his ear, at which he &s;hook his head, being doubtle&s;s tempted by this Traytor to take his part, which the <HI>Kneas</HI> refu&s;ing to doe, was forced to make this high and Tragical leap.</P>
<P><HI>Stenko Razin</HI> immediately hereupon committed great &s;laughter and robbing. The Brother of the Governor,
<PB N="9" REF="7">and many Noble-men and others, that would not come in to him, he put to the &s;word, as al&s;o many Dutch and other Officers, and &s;ome Holland Mari|ners, which though they run into the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea,</HI> yet are &s;aid to have been fetcht back and killed. Colonel <HI>Thomas Bely,</HI> and Lieutenant-Colonel <HI>Jacob Wanderow,</HI> and others, were put to the Sword, being in Arms up|on the walls of the Town. The Churches, Cloi&s;ters, and the Hou&s;es of the riche&s;t Citizens were plunder'd; the Writings of the Chancery burnt, the Czar's Trea|&s;ure of the Kingdom of <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> carried away, many Merchants &s;trangers, being there at that time, as Per|&s;ians, Indians, Turks, Arminians, and others, were put to death with the re&s;t: both the Sons of the Go|vernour <HI>Pro&s;orofskie</HI> he cau&s;ed to be hung up by the Legs upon the Walls of the Town, and to be taken down again, putting one of them, after much torture, to death, and cau&s;ing the other to be beaten half dead, and &s;o carried to the Metropolitan. His Lady and Daughters he delivered to the Soldiers, his Compa|nions, to take them for their Wives, or, if they plea&s;|ed to abu&s;e them. This taking of <HI>A&s;tracan</HI> happen'd <HI>Ju|ly</HI> 28. 1670.</P>
<P>After this, <HI>Stenko</HI> marched to <HI>Tzaret&s;a,</HI> and thence to <HI>Tzarataf,</HI> which were al&s;o deliver'd to him, and the Governors of them put to death, together with many Noble men; and the Trea&s;ure carried away.</P>
<P>The like happen'd to the Town <HI>Tzamatof;</HI> from whence <HI>Stenko</HI> went to the Town <HI>Simbierske,</HI> which he be&s;ieged, took by &s;torm, and burnt to a&s;hes, af|ter he had lo&s;t a great part of his Co&s;&s;acks before the Ca&s;tle of that place. The Governor of it was the Lord
<PB N="10" REF="8"><HI>Jwan Bochdaenwitz Mico&s;lafsky,</HI> who with extraordi|nary courage defended it again&s;t this Traytor: &s;o that <HI>Stenko,</HI> conquerour of all the places upon the <HI>Volga,</HI> was &s;top'd here from going further; without which he was re&s;olved to have marched to the Royal City <HI>Ca&s;an,</HI> not far di&s;tant from <HI>Simbierske.</HI></P>
<P>Although <HI>Stenko</HI> was now hindred to pa&s;s further, as being beaten, and wounded him&s;elf, in&s;omuch that he was con&s;trained to return to his <HI>A&s;tracan</HI>-Quar|ters, yet did he much mi&s;chief in <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> by his Emi&s;&s;a|ries, who here and there &s;tirr'd up the people to in&s;ur|rection. In <HI>Galitz</HI> the fire began, but was &s;oon quench|ed. About the Town <HI>Oe&s;tiga</HI> &s;ome of tho&s;e Emi&s;&s;aries were caught, taken, and hanged. Every where he pro|mi&s;ed Liberty, and a redemption from the Yoak (&s;o he call'd it) of the <HI>Bojars</HI> or Nobles, which he &s;aid were the oppre&s;&s;ors of the Countrey; In <HI>Mosko</HI> it &s;elf, men began to &s;peak openly in his prai&s;e, as if he were a per&s;on that &s;ought the publick good and the liberty of the people; for which cau&s;e the Great Czar was nece&s;&s;itated to make a publick example of &s;ome, to deterr the re&s;t.</P>
<P>A certain aged man being asked, what &s;hould be done in ca&s;e that <HI>Stenko</HI> &s;hould approach to the City of <HI>Mosko,</HI> an&s;wered, that the people &s;hould goe and meet him with Bread and Salt, which among the Ru&s;&s;ians is a token of Love and Friend&s;hip. For which this man was taken and hanged.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, there was brought into the &s;ame City, one of the principal A&s;&s;ociats of <HI>Stenko,</HI> that had undertaken to debauch the people up and down in the Countrey from their obedi|ence:
<PB N="11" REF="8">but he had his due reward; for one of his Arms, and one of his Legs were cut off, and he pre&s;ently hanged on the Gallows.</P>
<P>All &s;orts of imaginable mi&s;chievous devices were &s;et on foot by <HI>Stenko</HI> to ruine the Ru&s;&s;ian Empire, and to &s;educe the common people.</P>
<P>Among&s;t other Artifices, he had prepared two &s;hips, one of which was lined within round about with Red Velvet; and he gave out, that in it was the Lord <HI>Czarawitz,</HI> of Glorious memory, <HI>Alexis Alexewitz,</HI> the Great Czar's elde&s;t Son; who yet in the year 1670. on the 17th of <HI>January</HI> in the pre&s;ence of his Father, in the Pallace of <HI>Mosko,</HI> departed this life, and the next day was buried in the Metropolitan Church of <HI>S. Michel. Stenko</HI> boldly pretended, that this Prince was yet alive, and with him. And to colour this lye the better, he kept in the &s;aid &s;hip a Youth of about 16 years of age, de&s;cended of one of the <HI>Peregorsky Circa&s;&s;ian</HI> Princes, whom <HI>Stenko</HI> in his former depre|dations had taken pri&s;oner: which young Prince hath received the Great Czar's pardon, becau&s;e he was compelled to act &s;uch a per&s;on; and he is &s;till in <HI>Mosko,</HI> at the hou&s;e of <HI>Kneas Jacob Codonietewitz</HI> a <HI>Circa&s;&s;ian.</HI> And to drive on the&s;e devices, he &s;pred abroad, that this Lord <HI>Czarawitz</HI> had made an e&s;cape from the vi|olent hands of the Bojars and great Lords, and taken his refuge to him; adding, that he, <HI>Stenko,</HI> was come by order of the Great Czar to put to death all the Bo|jars, Nobles, Senators, and other great ones, (that were too near to his Maje&s;ty,) as Enemies and Tray|tors of their Countrey. By the&s;e ba&s;e practi&s;es invent|ed and pu&s;h't on by <HI>Stenko,</HI> the ignorant people was inflamed to fight furiou&s;ly, and tho&s;e of them that
<PB N="12" REF="9">were taken pri&s;oners underwent death with a won|derful re&s;olution, as being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the per&s;wa|&s;ion of dying for a good cau&s;e.</P>
<P>At <HI>Smolensko</HI> was hanged a certain per&s;on, who &s;aid, that he died upon having &s;een with <HI>Stenko</HI> the Prince <HI>Czarawitz,</HI> whereas he &s;aw but a counterfeit one.</P>
<P>The other &s;hip, that <HI>Stenko</HI> had, was lined with Black Velvet, and he gave out, that there was in it the late Patriarch <HI>Nikow,</HI> who in the year 1666. was, upon the Condemnation pa&s;&s;ed by the Patriarchs of <HI>Alexandria</HI> and of <HI>Antioch,</HI> by his Maje&s;ty, the Great Czar, depo&s;ed from his Dignity, and &s;ent to the Mo|na&s;tery of <HI>Beloo&s;er,</HI> where he is yet at this day.</P>
<P>By the&s;e Arts <HI>Stenko</HI> had &s;o far advanced his de&s;ign that the whole Tract of Land about the <HI>Volga</HI> and far|ther up into the Countrey was engaged in this rebel|lion, as far as to the Towns <HI>Accateur</HI> and <HI>Ar&s;a:</HI> And the number of the Rebels was augmented to two hun|dred thou&s;and, and part of the <HI>Czerni&s;che Tartars,</HI> and all the Ruffian Countrey-men living in this Tract, and belonging to Mu&s;covian Lords, ro&s;e up again&s;t their Governors killing and hanging them; and the fire of this Rebellion gained at length &s;o much ground, that it began to burn not above twelve miles from <HI>Mosko</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Hereupon the Great Czar rai&s;ed a great Army, and under the conduct of the Noble <HI>Kneas Jurge Alexewitz Dolgeroek</HI> &s;ent it, about the end of <HI>September,</HI> again&s;t the Enemy, of whom he met a party of Fifteen thou|&s;and men, who though they fought re&s;olutely and rallied three times, yet were at length beaten and put to &s;light, very many remaining dead upon the place,
<PB N="13" REF="9">and a great number being taken, who were immedi|ately executed. Six Field pieces fell into the hands of <HI>Dolgeroek;</HI> who encamped under the Town <HI>Ar&s;a|mas,</HI> where he exerci&s;ed &s;evere judgment upon the&s;e Rebels. The place was terrible to behold, and had the re&s;emblance of the Suburbs of Hell. Round a|bout it were Gallows, each of which was loaded with Forty or fifty Men. In another place lay many Beheaded and covered with Blood. Here and there &s;tood &s;ome impaled, whereof not a few lived unto the third day, and were heard to &s;peak. Within the &s;pace of Three Moneths, there were by the Hands of Executioners put to death Eleven thou&s;and Men, in a legal way, upon the hearing of Witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Dolgeroek</HI> him&s;elf remaining upon the place of Judg|ment, &s;ent his Army out by Parties, that found out, defeated, and di&s;per&s;ed <HI>Stenko</HI>'s forces. It was of great importance to <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> and a great Mercy of God, that the Rebels lay here and there divided; as al&s;o, that they could not agree among&s;t them&s;elves, about the Supream Command. For if this power of the Rebels, con&s;i&s;ting of Two hundred thou&s;and Men, had been united and unanimous, it would have been difficult for the Forces of the Czar to have re&s;i&s;ted and ma&s;tered the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The <HI>German</HI> Officers were highly applauded by His Maje&s;ty, for having acquitted them&s;elves &s;o well in leading on their Men. The mo&s;t re&s;olute of the Re|bels, were tho&s;e of the &s;mall Towns of <HI>Lisko</HI> and <HI>Mo|rasko,</HI> who had more than once attempted to take by &s;torm the Cloi&s;ter of <HI>Macariof,</HI> and lo&s;t a great number of Men before it, taking it at la&s;t by the treachery of a Jew, and putting to death all the Monks that were
<PB N="14" REF="10">found in it, and carrying away a rich prey, becau&s;e the people living thereabout had carried their Goods thither for &s;ecurity.</P>
<P><HI>Morasko</HI> held out; but tho&s;e of <HI>Lisko</HI> rendred them&s;elves in good time, and delivered Thirty of the Rebellious <HI>Co&s;acks,</HI> together with a Nephew of <HI>Stenko Razin,</HI> and &s;o they were pardoned.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the Pri&s;oners, there was brought to <HI>Kneas Jurge Dolgeroek</HI> a Nun in Man's habit, put over her Mona&s;tical dre&s;s. This Nun had commanded Seven thou&s;and Men, and done bravely in this War, till &s;he was taken pri&s;oner. There appeared not any altera|tion in her, nor any fear of death, when the Sentence of being Burnt alive was pronounced again&s;t her. Among&s;t the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ians</HI> the de&s;erting of a Mona&s;tery, is e&s;teemed a black and capital crime. A little before &s;he died, &s;he wi&s;hed that many more had behaved them&s;elves, and fought as couragiou&s;ly as &s;he had done; that then certainly <HI>Kneas Jurge</HI> would have found his be&s;t &s;afety in his heels.</P>
<P>Being now to die, &s;he &s;igned her&s;elf after the <HI>Ru&s;&s;i|an</HI> manner, with the cro&s;s on her forehead and bre&s;t, and &s;o laid her &s;elf quietly down upon the Pile, and was burnt to A&s;hes.</P>
<P>There was al&s;o brought to Judgment, one of <HI>Stenko Razin</HI>'s Confederates, and his be&s;t Coun&s;ellor, who had been his right hand. His Arms and Legs were cut off, and &s;o he was Beheaded and Hanged.</P>
<P>The Pri&s;oners were commonly put upon the Rack, and being examined, what they de&s;igned in this Re|bellion; they an&s;wered, That they intended for <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> and would have the lives of the Nobles, and other great ones, Their word was <HI>Not'&s;chay,</HI> that is
<PB N="15" REF="10">to &s;ay, <HI>&V;nexpected;</HI> intimating, That the Czarawitz <HI>Alexis Alexewitz</HI> was come as it were from Heaven, be&s;ides their expectation.</P>
<P>Thus hath <HI>Kneas Jurge Dolgeroek</HI> in the &s;pace of Three Moneths made an end of this Rebellion, in the Quarters about the River <HI>Don;</HI> but in other places the Fire was not yet extingui&s;hed, when the Czar called him back with his Army.</P>
<P>Mean time <HI>Kneas Con&s;tantine Czarbatof</HI> was by His Maje&s;ty commanded to march towards <HI>Taneboef,</HI> there to &s;ubdue the Rebels of tho&s;e parts; which al&s;o by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God was effected. So that all the Di&s;quieted and Rebellious Countreys have been, by Hanging, Burning, Beheading, Slaughtering (be&s;ides the Eleven thou&s;and Executed by the Hands of Hangmen,) and by killing in the Field above an Hundred thou&s;and Men, reduced to their former obedience.</P>
<P>But to return to <HI>Stenko Razin;</HI> after that he had been routed about <HI>Simbierske,</HI> and was retired down|wards, he cho&s;e a freer Air for his abode, and remain|ed for a while in the Wilderne&s;s of <HI>Steep,</HI> leaving to one of his Confederates, call'd <HI>Sjorte-Ous,</HI> that is the <HI>Divels Knuckle,</HI> the command of <HI>A&s;tracan: Stenko</HI> in the mean time, wandring up and down, until at length by the Captain <HI>Cornelius Jacolowitz,</HI> and tho&s;e of the <HI>Donsky-Co&s;acks</HI> that had remained faithful to the Czar, he was &s;ecured and brought into <HI>Mo&s;co.</HI> This <HI>Corne|lius Jacolowitz</HI> was God-father to <HI>Stenko,</HI> and always honored by him, as if he had been his Father; whence he never in the lea&s;t imagined, that that per|&s;on &s;hould contrive any mi&s;chief again&s;t him. But he
<PB N="16" REF="11">that was &s;o perfidious to his Prince, de&s;erved no better recompence.</P>
<P>He was laid hold on about <HI>Tzarietza,</HI> and carried that long way of Two hundred Miles to <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> en|tertained all along with the hopes, that he &s;hould &s;peak with the Great Czar him&s;elf, and before him, by word of Mouth, plead his own cau&s;e, he always imagining, that he had many things to &s;ay, very im|portant for the Czar to know.</P>
<P>His Brother <HI>Frolko</HI> was extreamly &s;ad on the way, and, it &s;eems, of a better nature than <HI>Stenko,</HI> whom he charged with all he had done. And <HI>Stenko</HI> &s;eeing his Brother at a certain time more than u&s;ually troubled, comforted him by repre&s;enting, that coming into the City of <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> they &s;hould receive great honor, thou&s;ands of people, and the greate&s;t of the Land being (doubtle&s;s) ready to meet, and to &s;ee them.</P>
<P><HI>Stenko</HI> coming within a mile of <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> the Waggon met him that had been made to bring him into the City according to his de&s;erts. In the hind-part of it was erected the Gallows; him&s;elf was &s;tripped of his Silken habit, which he had worn hitherto, and an old ragged Sute put upon him; and &s;o he was placed in the Waggon under the Gallows, with an Iron-Chain about his Neck, fa&s;tned to the top of the &s;ame. Both his hands were locked fa&s;t to the Side-beams of the Gallows, and his Legs divaricated. His Brother <HI>Frolko</HI> was with an Iron-Chain fa&s;tned to the Wag|gon, and went a foot on the &s;ide of it.</P>
<P>Thus entred <HI>Stenko</HI> with his Brother into the City of <HI>Mo&s;co,</HI> Thou&s;ands of People, of great and mean condition, beholding them, and &s;o fulfilling his Pro|phe&s;ie
<PB N="17" REF="11">of the honor he &s;hould have in entring this Town. And though he comforted his Brother with this honor, yet him&s;elf &s;tanding in the Waggon look|ed on no body, but held his Face continually down|ward.</P>
<P>They were both put to the torture, but what they there confe&s;&s;ed, is not well known; onely that <HI>Stenko</HI> did very much lament the death of his Brother, who by the command of <HI>Kneas Jurge Dolgeroek</HI> had former|ly been hanged.</P>
<P>His Brother <HI>Frolko</HI> behaving him&s;elf mo&s;t pittifully under the torture, <HI>Stenko</HI> went about to comfort him again, and &s;aid, That he mu&s;t remember the good things he had enjoyed; that he had lived &s;o long among his Friends with great credit and reputation, and had commanded thou&s;ands; and therefore he was now to bear this hard fortune with patience.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ru&s;&s;es</HI> u&s;e this manner of Torture; they &s;have the Crown of the Head of a Malefactor, and drop cold Water upon it, which they &s;ay cau&s;eth very great pain. It is related, That when the Crown of <HI>Stenko,</HI> and his Brother was &s;haved, <HI>Stenko</HI> &s;aid to his Brother, I have often heard, that none is &s;haved for a Prie&s;t, but he mu&s;t be Learned; we are both un|learned, and yet they do us the honor of &s;having our Crown.</P>
<P>Four days after that he was brought in, he was with his Brother carried to the place of Execution in the Cittadel. The Sentence of Death was read be|fore him, wherein were expre&s;&s;ed the Principal Vil|lanies he had committed. He &s;eemed not at all concerned, and &s;poke not a word, but &s;tooped. And when the Executioner was going to do his office, he
<PB N="18" REF="12">cro&s;&s;ed him&s;elf &s;everal times, directing his face to|wards a certain Church, called <HI>Pret&s;iet&s;e Bogorodiet&s;e Ca&s;aneche;</HI> that is, <HI>The mo&s;t Holy Mother of God of Ca&s;an.</HI> And thereupon he bowed his head thrice to|wards three &s;everal places of the people a&s;&s;embled, &s;aying, <HI>Prostie,</HI> that is, <HI>Forgive me.</HI> And pre&s;ently he was laid down between two Beams, and his Right Arm cut off to the Elbow, and his Left Leg to the Knee. After this, his Head was cut off with an Hatchet: All which was done with great &s;peed in a very &s;hort time; and <HI>Stenko</HI> gave not the lea&s;t &s;igh, nor &s;hewed any &s;ign of &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>His Brother coming to the place of Execution, cry|ed out, <HI>That he had the Czar's word;</HI> a manner of ex|pre&s;&s;ion, when a per&s;on hath any &s;ecret to reveal, which is to be manife&s;ted to none, but to the great Czar alone.

<P>This was the end of <HI>Stenko Razin;</HI> his Deputy <HI>Sjorte-Ous</HI> whom he had left to command in <HI>Astracan,</HI> is &s;aid to have rai&s;ed new commotions; putting to Death the Metropolite, and others that are contrary to his de&s;ign.
