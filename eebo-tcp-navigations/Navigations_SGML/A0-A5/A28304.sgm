<HEAD>A De&s;cription OF THE PROVINCE and BAY OF DARIAN.</HEAD>
<P><HI>DARIAN</HI> is a Province lying in the <HI>Isthmus</HI> that &s;epa|rats the <HI>North-Sea</HI> from the <HI>South-Sea</HI> in the Latitude of 8 Degrees and 25 Minuts. <HI>North-Latitude,</HI> The Entry of the River lyeth near 30 Miles from <HI>Darian-City,</HI> which is the Metropolitan of it's Province. The Word <HI>Darian</HI> &s;ignifies in the <HI>Indian</HI> Speech, a Shady, City or Town. And it was never Conquered by any in Man's Memory; It's called a &s;hadowed Town, becau&s;e it's Situated betwixt two great Ranges of high Hills, lying on the Ea&s;t and We&s;t, and running North and South, with a River called by it's own Name, <HI>Darian River.</HI> And it lying &s;o near the Line, they are not priviledged with the Sun-&s;hine, but at 12 a Clock of the Day, which is near right over their Heads at that time: And then the Reflects of the Sun from off the River and Hill-&s;ides, cau&s;es &s;uch an extream Heat: But &s;ufferable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bay</HI> of <HI>Darian</HI> begins from <HI>Cap de Samblas</HI> on the We&s;t, and ends at <HI>Cap de Caenu</HI> on the Ea&s;t; this is by the <HI>Indians</HI> own allowance, tho' other Draughts makes it three times Broader. To the North lyes off the&s;e I&s;lands <HI>I&s;le de Pinos</HI> or I&s;le of <HI>Pinos,</HI> and &s;ome other I&s;lands that lyes near to the Shoar, called I&s;l. de <HI>Orr</HI> or Golden I&s;land. As al&s;o <HI>Tortuga</HI> or Tortois I&s;l. becau&s;e of the Plenty of
<PB N="2" REF="4">the&s;e mo&s;t delicate &amp; whol&s;ome <HI>Amphibius</HI> Creatures for Man's U&s;e; for they participate of Fi&s;h, Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h, &amp; Fowl, they Swim in the Sea as a Fi&s;h &amp; feeds upon Gra&s;s that growes upon Rocks, like a Bull or Cow, &amp; they lay Eggs like a Fowll &amp; that incredible Numbers, for I have taken out of an hole in the Sand 300 and oddsat a time. In &s;hort it's an excellent whol&s;ome Food any manner of way dre&s;&s;ed; I would &s;ay more of it were it not known to all to be true, that it would exceed the bounds of thir few Sheets. There is another I&s;land called <HI>Furte,</HI> which lyeth off of the Mouth of the <HI>Le-goun</HI> of <HI>&V;raba,</HI> which &s;ignifieth Safe Anchorage, and indeed &s;o it may be called for 1000 Sail of Ships can Ride in it with much Freedom; There's from 5 to 10 Fathome deep Wa|ter, with good white chynely ground mixed with white Coryll at the Bottom, in which there is va&s;t variety of &s;e|veral good whol&s;om Fi&s;hes; But e&s;pecially that much ad|mired Creature called <HI>Manaty,</HI> which &s;ignifies <HI>Sea-Cow</HI> in the <HI>Indian</HI> Speech, and many other great and &s;mall Fi&s;hes. The Mouth of this <HI>Le-goun</HI> is about 80 Yairds over, and groweth Wider the further you Sale in it; Its in Form like a <HI>Semi-Circle.</HI> The Word <HI>Le-goun</HI> &s;ignifies a Lake or Loch.</P>
<P>All this whole Province of <HI>Darian,</HI>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Soile.</NOTE> is of a good Strong and fertile Soile and very whol&s;ome, &s;trong bodied People po&s;&s;e&s;&s;e it, which they them&s;elves think, that it's the whol|&s;omne&s;s of the Air and Climate, that makes them &s;uch well bodied Men and Women. There is good &s;tore of good Water Springs which flow down from off the&s;e high Ran|ges of Mountains in the time of their Rainy Moneths, <HI>viz.</HI> from the middle of <HI>November,</HI> to the middle or end of <HI>Janu|ary:</HI> And then all the re&s;t of the year is fair plea&s;ant and Serene Weather as can be, but Hot with all, which occa&s;i|ons their ground generally to be &s;o Fertile; but e&s;pecially all about the Lake or <HI>Legoun</HI> of <HI>&V;raba.</HI> For in the time of
<PB N="3" REF="4">the&s;e Rains all their <HI>Savanas</HI> or <HI>Salinas, id est</HI> Meadows are &s;o over flown with Dirt and Rubbi&s;h, which is wa&s;hed down from the high Mountains, that when it comes to &s;ettle u|pon the low Grounds, it's like to Nilus in a manner: For what they have to Sow or Plant, they do it while the Mud is yet Soft, and in 28 days time, I have &s;een Mellons, Cu|cumbers and Gourds and many &s;uch like Roots come to Ma|turity in the &s;aid time, which I ever imputed to the&s;e Rains and the Reflex of the Sun off of the Water and Hill-&s;ides down upon the Vallies or Meadow Grounds. It's an con|tinued Summer for all things are Green there all the year o|ver, Trees of &s;ome &s;ort of Fruit will have upon them all atone time, Blo&s;&s;oms budded or &s;et Fruit, and &s;ome half Ripe others wind-&s;haken, various are the Numbers of all &s;orts of Fruit, Trees, and other &s;tately Trees, for Food and Build|ing; As al&s;o all manner of wild Fowl, e&s;pecially Turkies and Partriges, Turtle doves, Parats, with various other &s;orts of Fowles both &s;mall and great: As al&s;o that &s;mal in|&s;ect <HI>Cuchaniel.</HI> Here groweth that famous Tree called the <HI>Cocur-nute-tree,</HI> which affords all at one time, Food, Ray|ment, &amp; all other nece&s;&s;aries fitting for Hou&s;hold U&s;e. Here groweth al&s;o the much talked of <HI>Cabadge-Tree,</HI> which I have mea&s;ured when blown down with the Wind, above 100 Foot betwixt the Root above Ground, and the bot|tom of the Cabadge that grows upon the top of it. Here grows al&s;o that much e&s;teemed Nut called <HI>Coco-Nut</HI> of which the Chacolat is made; And here al&s;o groweth that Rair and mo&s;t Fragrant and Odoriferous Apple, called <HI>Pinn-Apple,</HI> which I am &s;ure many of your fine Ladies would give their Silk Gown for one of them to play with a while. In &s;hort, I have not now Time nor Bounds, to &s;et down all the mo&s;t excellent Species of Fruits, &s;uch as <HI>Mammi</HI> and <HI>Mammi Suportas,</HI> and <HI>Guovas,</HI> &amp;c. and Roots and other Herbs, which are all very Medicinal as well as whol&s;ome for Food to Man and Bea&s;t.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="5">
<P>There is likewayes found in the&s;e Rivers,
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gold.</NOTE> <HI>viz. Darian</HI> &amp; <HI>Sancta-Maria</HI> Rivers great plenty of Gold-du&s;t, which the <HI>Indians</HI> drains through &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els with holes in the bot|tome of them, in the time of the&s;e great Rains. The Gold is wa&s;hed from the Mines of <HI>Sagra</HI> and the Moun|tains of <HI>Carabana</HI> &amp; <HI>Guattimala:</HI> Hills in &s;hort, it's a Rich Countrey with Gold; for I have been told by very An|tient Natives of the Place, that they have laughed at their <HI>Southern</HI> Neighbours <HI>Peruvians</HI> who have boa&s;ted of their having Hou&s;es full of Gold; That their King's Ran&s;om called <HI>Atabalidas</HI> who was taken Captive by the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> was no le&s;s offered for him than an Hou&s;e full of Gold, and if that would not do, they would give for his Ran&s;om four times as much Silver; his Hou&s;e was &s;aid to be 22 foot long, 17 foot broad and 36 foot high; yet notwith&s;tand|ing of all this great boa&s;t of the <HI>Peruvians</HI> Gold and Silver. The People of <HI>Darian</HI> laughed at them, and told them that that quantity which they bragged of, was but like a Mou&s;e to an <HI>Eliphant</HI> in compari&s;on of the Mines of <HI>Darian,</HI> which to this hour they &s;ay containes in them more Gold than Earth, and I have &s;een it &s;o in many places my &s;elf, when that I lived in <HI>Darian</HI> a few years agoe. As al&s;o, I have &s;een their Hor&s;es &s;hodd with Silver Shoes and with Beaten Gold, Bridles with Precious Stones, &s;ett in all the re&s;t of the Furniture, and the Hou&s;hold Ve&s;&s;ells all of Sil|ver and Gold. I could Write much more concerning the va&s;t Riches that are there in the&s;e places; but I know that my Countrey-men are generally <HI>Thoma&s;&s;es,</HI> or at lea&s;t I am &s;ure that they would be content to be <HI>Thoma&s;&s;es</HI> by ex|perience in this matter.</P>
<P>I told you before that the People of <HI>Darian</HI> are a &s;trong well proportioned People, only I forgot to tell you that they are of a Dark-yellow, or Copper-colour, having lit|tle or no Beards at all, but a &s;traight Rank long Black-hair
<PB N="5" REF="5">as Jeat, &s;ome of them have it to their middle, others longer, Women to their heels; They Generally go all naked, e&s;pecially before that they be Married, and but few of the Women kind, unle&s;s they are of a higher degree, that ever covers their nakedne&s;s, even after they are Mar|ried; and when that they do it, it's not half covered either, whither it may be imputed to be the <HI>Taylors</HI> fault that takes not a true mea&s;ure, or the <HI>Merchants</HI> fault that begroudges enough of Cloath, I know not.</P>
<P>The Men are allowed to take as many Wives as he can keep or maintain, and the way of their Marriage is this:
<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marri|age.</NOTE> A Man cannot Mary his Si&s;ter, or Mother, or Daughter; other degrees of Kindred they re&s;pect not, for the Uncles Marie with their Cu&s;ings, the more Wives a Man hath he is e&s;teemed the more Worthie, Great and Rich; for when any of them offends him he di&s;po&s;es of her and her Chil|dren; if that &s;he have any to be Slaves to any who will buy them, and &s;o getts other Goods by the bargain, which likes him better: But Generally all his Wives live very long contentedly together, without murmuring at others en|joying of their Husbands oftners than others, and after any of them is with Child, &s;he will not ly with her Husband till delivered, nor yet come near Men; But when that they are fit for Men's u&s;e, either Maid or Married Woman will not. When that they Marry, the Man asketh the Wo|mans Friends or Neighbours if that &s;he hath any, asking if that it be their will to let &s;uch a Maid or &s;uch a Widow Marie or Match with him; if that &s;he &s;ay yea, they away they go all to his hou&s;e, and Solemnizes the Wedding in Eating and Drinking for 3 or 4 days: But at the entry to the Hou&s;e, the Husband gives her an ear of Corn, &s;igni|fying to her that &s;he mu&s;t Sow the Ground, and &s;he gives him a Lance, or els a Bow and Arrow, &s;ignifying that he mu&s;t go to the Warrs and Wodes to fight and hunt for his
<PB N="6" REF="6">and his Family, then to &s;uch Victuals and Drink as they have, which is all &s;orts of <HI>Jerkt-hogg</HI> that is Fle&s;hed down without Bones. As al&s;o, all &s;orts of <HI>Barbekewd</HI> meats both of Fi&s;h, Fle&s;h and Fowl, that is to &s;ay, all &s;orts Ro&s;ted. Then for Fruits and Roots of various &s;orts, they want not plenty of them, as I told you before, and for Drinks called <HI>Mu&s;lawhi</HI> it's made of <HI>Plantings</HI> or <HI>Bonano's,</HI> which are Roots not unlike our <HI>Carrot,</HI> only alike bigg at both ends, and a little crooked, the&s;e they boyle all to Ma&s;h and Strain off the clear and drink it. They have al&s;o Drink which is made of <HI>Maiz, Turkie-wheat</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;ader,</HI> other-wayes called <HI>Farina de Poo,</HI> whereof is made their Meal that they bake for Bread. <HI>Farina de Poo</HI> &s;ignifyes Flower or Wheat of Timber, &s;uch as hath been Reported long agoe to be &s;awings of Trees. I could fill a whole &s;heet of Pa|per with the vertues and u&s;es of this <HI>Ca&s;ader,</HI> but however plea&s;e to accept of what you have here for the time.</P>
<P>Before they go to ly down upon their <HI>Wild-kain-tops,</HI> which is all the Bed that they u&s;e, they go and wa&s;h in the River, whereon, or near to their Hou&s;es are commonly built, and when they are well wa&s;hed, then they return home and lye down: Their Hou&s;es I told you are made upon River-&s;ides for Cleanne&s;s and for Air, for they make them generally of an Hutt fa&s;hion made of wild Kains &s;et together into the Ground as clo&s;e as can be, and covered over with the Tops of the&s;e Wild-kains for Cleanline&s;s, for they will not di&s;charge Nature upon the Ground, if that they can help it, but run into a River where that it may be carried away with the Current: But if that they be far from a River, then they dig a Hole with a Stick in the Ground, and &s;o cover it up afterwards; They are cleaner about the Doors than many of the Doors at the Cro&s;s of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> unle&s;s that my Countrey-folks have mended their Manners. The Men generally labour but little in
<PB N="7" REF="6">the Fields, but only the Women &amp; old Folks &s;o long as they are able to go alone, the Men are imployed in Hunting and Fi&s;hing and Fowling, and making In&s;truments for War, &s;uch as Bows and Arrows, and Lances and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>When their Wives bring furth their Children, their Hu&s;|bands take them from the Womb, and with his Teeth byts their Navel-&s;trings off, and then flatts the No&s;e of the Child, either by an Squize upon it, or by tying an flat piece of Board or Bone upon it, for they covet much to be plain-faced Gentlemen, &amp; then bores a Hole through the under Lip of it, that through time I have thought that they have had two Mouths, through which I have heard them make an &s;trange &s;ort of an Voice, but the proper u&s;e is to hang Gold or precious Stones in it; As al&s;o they hang a piece of Gold through the Partition of their No&s;e down o|ver the Mouth and Chin, &s;o hath the Woman a great thick Ring of Gold through the &s;ame place of their No&s;es al&s;o, &s;o that when they go to War, they attyre all them&s;elves with the riche&s;t Things that they have, and when that they Drink they are forced to hold it up with one Finger while the other Hand is at their Mouth; They hang al&s;o pieces of Gold at their Hair, and the Men cover their Privies with an hollow piece of Gold which is tyed about their Body witha &s;mall Weeth of a Tree, then they Paint their Legs with a certain Juice of an Herb that they call <HI>Pindo,</HI> and as I take the word to be, it &s;hould &s;ignifie <HI>Paint,</HI> for there|with they do paint their Legs all over; that in a &s;mall time they cannot hardly wa&s;h it off; &s;o that I have thought that they had a pair of cliver &s;trait Black boots on their Leggs at a di&s;tance, then they oyl all their Bodies, and marches up Man and Woman, Bag and Baggage, to the Place where their King hath appointed an Randezvouze and there pitch their Tents, until that the King plea&s;es to March; ye mu&s;t know that
<PB N="8" REF="7">the Stoute&s;t and Tale&s;t Men are made likeways King, and not by Heritage, and the next Tale&s;t and Stoute&s;t are Officers under him; again, they come to the Wives and Children, in the time that they are Incamped, tho&s;e of the brave&s;t and &s;toute&s;t Hearts among&s;t them fall a cutting and &s;la&s;hing of their Skine with a Fi&s;h-tooth which they keep for the u&s;e: The places that they cut are their Brows, Cheeks, Arms, Shoulder-blades, Brea&s;ts and Thighs, and &s;ome their Hipps, both men and Women; I have &s;een &s;o Carved with all &s;orts of Birds, Fowls and Fi&s;hes, when their Wounds are bleeding they &s;top them full of a certain powder, that both dryes and heals the&s;e &s;mall wounds, and al&s;o cau&s;es the&s;e parts of their Body to &s;well and ri&s;e higher than other places doth, of which they are very proud, becau&s;e they are taken for valiant and brave Men, then when they are all well, their King Proclames a Speech in this manner, my brave and Stout men, ye'll know that our Fore-fathers were mo&s;t abominably Murdered, and their Goods taken from them, and their Wives and Children taken captives unto &s;uch a Province; Therefore it becomes you all now to prove your &s;elves Brave and Stout Men, in going along&s;t with me to be Revenged upon them for it; Therefore declare all your minds, upon which they &s;how their willingne&s;s by oyling of their Bodies again; &s;o that they cannot ea&s;ily be catched hold of, and &s;o Bagg and Baggadge follow in order as afore is &s;aid; and when that they met within any Bow-&s;hot they all let fly together &s;o long as they have Arrows to &s;hoot, &amp; when all is gone they fall to Work with their Lances and wooden Halbirts Pell|mell, until &s;ome of the &s;ides yeild, and then the Wives fall a Plundering of the Enemies Wives, and in the mean time the Men are &s;ecureing the Pri&s;oners, and afterwards they all march Home; and when that they come through any of their Towns, the King cryes out with a loud voice, <HI>Erima,
<PB N="9" REF="7">Erima, Toupina-Baults Canomi, Gua&s;ione, Tan Tan,</HI> That is, behold what valiant actions we have done for the bring|ing you the&s;e villanous Men that abu&s;ed our Fore-fathers; &s;hal we not Murder them, Murder them, then the People call out aloud, <HI>Zanupa, Zanupa,</HI> That is to &s;ay <HI>furthwith furthwith,</HI> which accordingly they do, &s;ome in every Town, until all be killed. The way how that they kill them, is, by tying them fa&s;t to a Po&s;t, and &s;o Shoots Arrows at them, by degrees, until that they &s;hoot him or her through the Heart, then the women quarters them and gives their bowels to their Children to rubb them&s;elves all over with them, to make them the more Bloody-minded again&s;t their enemies, when that they come to be Men, they <HI>Barbikew</HI> their quar|ters and keeps a Fea&s;t in the chief Place of the Town, playing upon Flutts, that either are made of other Dead Mens-leggs, or Thigh-bones, or el&s;e the Bones of the&s;e pre&s;ent who&s;e fle&s;h are eating at the time. Then when all this Fea&s;t is ended, and every Man home to his Family and Peace begins to be Proclamed over all that Province, The&s;e Men that are jealous of any of their Wives that have &s;tayed at Home, as many of them do, they get an order from their old Pagels or Prie&s;ts, to bring her before the People of the Town, where &s;he is &s;et upon an high place above the re&s;t, and then the Pagel asketh her if &s;he be guilty of Adul|try or not, if that &s;he denys, then he gives her about half a Gill of a certain Red-water, which is as bitter as any Gall, or Wormwood, and gives it her to drink: which if that &s;he be guilty, it will in a quarter of an hours time bur&s;t her Belly and rott her Thighs; and if that &s;he be not guilty, it hurts her no more than plain Water would have done, if that &s;he had drunk as much. I would de&s;ire that none of my Countrey Women &s;hould get any of this Water &s;ent Home as a Propine of their own Colony in <HI>Darian,</HI> for fear it prove their Hone&s;ty, as I have it &s;een done upon
<PB N="10" REF="8">them poor Heathens: It looks &s;omething like to the bitter Water that we read of in the Law of Jealou&s;ie in the Leviti|cal Law.</P>
<P>When the Children are born and laid by the Mother of it, the Father brings it a little wooden Lance and a little Bow and Arrow with a wooden little Knife and Ki&s;&s;es him if a Son, &s;aying unto him, my Son, when that thou art great, thou mu&s;t be &s;trong to revenge thy &s;elf upon thy Enemies. They have divers names for their Children, &s;uch as <HI>Orapoe|cen,</HI> that is Bow and Arrow, <HI>Sarigoy,</HI> that is four footed Bea&s;t, <HI>Arignan,</HI> that is an Hen, <HI>Araboton,</HI> that is an <HI>American</HI> Tree, <HI>Pindo,</HI> that is an Herb they paint withall, as ye heard before. The Mother gets a drink of <HI>Mu&s;lawhi</HI> or two, and Crambs the <HI>Pickaninis</HI> Mouth, that is to &s;ay the little ones Mouth, with &s;ome boyled Root or other, and then gives it Suck for to wa&s;h it down with all and takes a &s;mall Weeth or Bark of a Tree, tying the Child to her back, &amp; ca&s;ts o|ver her Shoulder, which Pape or Brea&s;t &s;he places that whereat the Infant may Suck at its plea&s;ure; and &s;o &s;he goes about any Bu&s;&s;ine&s;s that &s;he has to do either about their Hou&s;e or in the Fields, They are truly brave Nur&s;es, for tho' that there Children are never Swadled, yet there is none among&s;t them either young or old that ever I &s;aw Crooked or Deformed, which I impute to the &s;trength of the Mothers Milk, I have had Children of my own Nur&s;ed by the&s;e <HI>In|dians,</HI> and they take it as a great favour done to them, to let them give Suck to our Children, which they have done many times when that I lived in <HI>America.</HI> As their Chil|dren grows up they teach them how to make Bows and Ar|rows, Lances and &s;uch like Tools for to fight their Enemies with all, as you have heard already the way how that they fight, and how that the u&s;e their Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>They Hunt with &s;everal &s;orts of Arrows according as they de&s;ign their Sport, &s;ome &s;mall and &s;harp pointed with

<P>I have &s;poken with old men that have de&s;cribed to me a great Fowl in &s;hape like the <HI>Griffen,</HI> but they are all ba|ni&s;ht of late years; As al&s;o are all the Lyons, Tygers, Le|opards and Bears that u&s;ed to haunt the Mountains, and in &s;ted of them, there is great plenty of all &s;orts of Munkies, &amp; delicat Fowls as is aforementioned, which Munkies are very good Meat to them that know them, I have eaten 40 times of them, and would do it yet, before I would eat Mager or Lean-fle&s;h.</P>
<P>They are generally kind to all Strangers except <HI>Spaini|ards,</HI> whom they hate with a perfect hatred, as they have good cau&s;e to do, con&s;idering their horrid and inhumane Murder that they committed upon the&s;e poor &s;illy harmle&s;s <HI>Heathens:</HI> It's not many Years ago &s;ince I &s;aw upon the
<PB N="12" REF="9">Coa&s;t of <HI>Peru</HI> 100 Carcages of murdered <HI>Indians</HI> turned in|to Mumy, tho' a long time &s;ince; The&s;e &s;andy hot Coun|treys keeps their Carcages from con&s;uming; I call them Car|cages becau&s;e they are lying like as many dead dryed Sheep, only they want the Wool that Sheep bear in the&s;e parts of the World: But I will not talk of <HI>Peru</HI> till I have fini|&s;hed the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Darian.</HI> I &s;ay that they are kind to Strangers, for if that they know that you are de&s;igned to go up the Countrey, they will carry you in Ham makers up|on their &s;houlders with two Men one on each &s;ide of you, carrying Water or Wine and Fire and Tobacco, if that you have occa&s;ion for either of them, and when that ye come to the Place where their King or chief Man liveth, ye are made welcome by him and all the re&s;t of his Court, by hugging of you in their Arms, and &s;cratching of your Back or Shoulders with their Fingers, the which you mu&s;t do the like to them, then you are &s;et down upon a Straw|matt, or &s;ome &s;uch like thing by the King, or next be&s;t Man to him, and if that you have an Interpreter to acquaint them with your Bu&s;ine&s;s, they will all hear him, or your &s;elf if that you can &s;peak the Language, until that you have made an end, and then the King tells it to all his Court round about him, which if that it be a thing that plea&s;es him, he claps his right Hand a cro&s;s his Heart, and gives two or three Nods with his Head, which all &s;ignifie he likes the News or your Di&s;cour&s;e with his Heart, and &s;o if that he do not like it, &s;hakes his Head and looks of a &s;ower Countenance, and crys out aloud <HI>Zeto patae,</HI> id e&s;t, <HI>I am not well plea&s;ed;</HI> But if that he is well plea&s;ed, then he crys aloud <HI>Yatabala Comorada,</HI> that is, <HI>ye are welcome to him as a Friend;</HI> and &s;o in confirmation of this he drinks to you, clapping his Heart fir&s;t, and afterwards takes you by the Hand, and Drinks to you, that is a &s;ign that ye are as wel|come to him as his Heart, and &s;o ye drink all round in this
<PB N="13" REF="9">Fa&s;hion till it comes to the King again, and then to Victuals ye go, to &s;uch as I have &s;poken of already, and the way of dre&s;&s;ing of it. And farder to, to complement you with the Kindne&s;s, they give you either their own or their Wifes Si&s;ter to wait upon you while that you &s;tay in Countrey, which if you except of them, it is taken by them as an ex|traordinary piece of Favour conferred upon the Family in accepting of their Relation; ye may u&s;e her if that you plea&s;e, which if that you do, I am &s;ure it mu&s;t either be for rarities Cau&s;e, or el&s;e extream Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>But be &s;ure that you take her not with you when that you return either to your Store-hou&s;e, or yet a Shipboard, by conveying her &s;ecretly away as &s;ome hath done, to the great Damage of the&s;e that may perhaps come into the &s;ame Place for Trade, as I knew it once fall out not many years ago; But that if ye leave her with them, as al&s;o a few Beeds or &s;uch like Toyes, then be&s;ure that they &s;hall convoy you down in State, with Mu&s;ick before you, and &s;ome of the be&s;t of the Place will go at your &s;ide, and others holding an <HI>Subumbrera</HI> (as the <HI>Spainiards</HI> call it) over your Head, o|thers carrying <HI>Palm-wine</HI> and <HI>Tobacco;</HI> for fire they can make it out of a green and dry Stick by Frixation pre&s;ent|ly to you, if need require.</P>
<P>When that ye are come home either to the Store-hou&s;e or the Ship ye cau&s;e compliment tho&s;e that conveyed you down with Beeds, Coper or Bra&s;s-Rings, and Whi&s;tles of all &s;orts a few of them, and they will return you 1000 times the worth of it either in Gold or in Silver, be&s;ides what Provi&s;ions of <HI>Barbekewed-Fi&s;h</HI> and Fle&s;h they will &s;end down to you.</P>
<P>At your departure from them, ye mu&s;t &s;hake hands and &s;cart their Back as I told you before; and then they will cry out <HI>Zata faca Balla Comerada,</HI> that is, <HI>many bold and hearty &s;ucce&s;s to you my Friend;</HI> &s;o away they march home and &s;how all their Wealth they have gotten from you. If ye have given them any &s;mall Looking-Gla&s;&s;es, that is two or three days Work for them to behold their beautiful Faces into, and &s;ometimes looking upon the back &s;ide of the
<PB N="14" REF="10">Gla&s;s, to &s;ee if the Party be there that they &s;aw in the fore|&s;ide of the Gla&s;s.</P>
<P>Now for their Religion, you mu&s;t know that all the Heathens in the&s;e Parts, have &s;ome &s;ort of a god or other that they wor&s;hip; either for fear of Love, <HI>viz.</HI> There is a <HI>Palm-tree</HI> which affords them Wine every day: and there is a Root that they call <HI>Api</HI> they wor&s;hip, becau&s;e its good for to make Bread of. There is the Sun and Moon, be|cau&s;e they receive Light from them. Next, there is the Devil they wor&s;hip in various Shapes, as they have told me; they &s;ee their <HI>Vala&s;a,</HI> that is, <HI>their great Prophet,</HI> &s;ome|time in a Mans Shape, &s;ometimes in a Bea&s;ts, and other times in a Birds Shape. There is a Fi&s;h that they call <HI>Cay|man,</HI> that is a <HI>Crocadoil</HI> or <HI>Allagator;</HI> and there are <HI>Snails</HI> and <HI>Serpents</HI> of all &s;orts that they wor&s;hip al&s;o. I could in|&s;i&s;t to 10 Sheets of Paper upon their way of Wor&s;hip, and how often in the year, and al&s;o what Harm comes to them that by Chance kill either of the&s;e gods: but wanting time, I &s;hall forbear till the next Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>There is one thing I cannot omit, That I have &s;een &s;ome &s;orts of them that can neither comprehend an Oath, nor yet a Lye; though I have demon&s;trat both to them, they would tell that it is impo&s;&s;ible that any thing that looks like a Man, can be guilty of either.</P>
<P>Their way of Swearing, is either by their Fathers or Mo|thers back-&s;ide; or if it be a great and deep Oath, then they &s;wear by their Grandfathers; and if no body will believe the Truth that they are &s;aying, then they &s;wear by their great Grandfathers and Mothers back-&s;ide. But as for Lyeing, I never could get them to comprehend it. This way of Swearing they tell me hath been ever with them: I think it looks &s;omething like <HI>Abrahams</HI> making of his Ser|vant put his Hand under his Thigh when he was going a Wooing of a Wife for his Son. Yet this &s;ort of them, are they that wor&s;hip the Devil.</P>
<P>They have no way of Learning among&s;t any of them: their way of numbering anything, is by &s;mall Stones, or
<PB N="15" REF="10">pickles of great Corn; and they keep tho&s;e that they have compted by them, till Occa&s;ion calls for them.</P>
<P>Their Ages they keep, or compt by &s;o many Moons; they have no Names for the Months. I have reckoned up &s;o many Moons, as that hath come to 105, and 110; yea, &s;ome 120 years old, and brisk old Men, notwith&s;tanding which, I impute to the whole&s;omene&s;s of the Countrey of <HI>Darian.</HI></P>
<P>There is others of them that believes the Re&s;urrection of the Body; becau&s;e I have &s;een of their Graves that have been accidentally opened; and the&s;e of their Friends have gone and taken all their Bones and carried them Home, and put them in a place where that they would ly &s;afe: I have ask|ed them the Rea&s;on of it; they would tell me that he would have occa&s;ion for them, when he &s;hould ri&s;e to go behind the great High-hill where all the brave and &s;trong Men goe; and the&s;e that are not brave and &s;trong men, when they Ri&s;e, they go to a dark Cave, and there neither hear, nor &s;ee the brave Singing and Dancing, that they that go be|hind the high Hill &s;ee, hear and act al&s;o: but &s;hall &s;tay in that place till one <HI>Agga</HI> &s;hall come and beat his Bones to pieces. <HI>Agga,</HI> that is, <HI>an evil or bad man.</HI></P>
<P>Their Phy&s;icians they call <HI>Paggies,</HI> plays the Rogue much with them, for they know certain Herbs and Gumms, that when they plea&s;e to tell them that they are &s;ick in &s;uch a part of their Body, that they apply a Bli&s;tering Pla&s;ter to it, which immediatly bli&s;ter their Fle&s;h, and as &s;oon they will heal it, by applying of a certain Gumm, of which there is great Store of all &s;orts, both of Herbs, Oyls and Gumms in this Province of <HI>Darian;</HI> I have &s;een the Effects of &s;e|verals of them tryed to admiration.</P>
<P>Their Di&s;ea&s;es are generally <HI>Calentures, Fluxes</HI> and <HI>Yeas,</HI> or that we call the <HI>Clap,</HI> at which they are very dextrous, in curing in 24 Hours time, by a certain Root they give inwardly for that Effect.</P>
<P>When they are lying on Death-bed, their Friends Dance Sing and Roar all the time Night and Day, and the &s;ick Per&s;on takes it as a great piece of Kindne&s;s done to him to
<PB N="16" REF="11">attend him in this manner. But as &s;oon as he is dead, they howl and mourn with extreme Howlings, e&s;pecially if he was a man of E&s;teem among&s;t them, or yet a brave &s;trong man. Al&s;o the old Women cryes out, O what a lu&s;ty and &s;trong and cunning Hunter and Fi&s;her this <HI>Ehu</HI> (that is man) was! Thus they continue for &s;ix Hours time untill he be buried, for they keep none in the&s;e parts longer than &s;ix Hours time, and they bury them in a deep Hole upright putting in above him Fowls Feathers of various Colours to deck his Lance and weapons of VVar with, when he &s;hall go to the back of the Hill and Dance with the re&s;t of the brave men that are gone before him: Al&s;o they power a|bout him &s;ome Palm wine and &s;et a &s;taff before him, and &s;ome Tobacco and Pipes, then they de&s;ire him to mind them to &s;uch and &s;uch as are gone before him to Dance at the back of this great Hill, and they put the Earth about him, and returns with a Lamentation, Crying out, O this &s;trong <HI>Ehu</HI> is gone! who will bring us now the Bodies of our E|nemies to eat as he u&s;ed to do; Thus they continue to mourn for a VVeeks time.</P>
<P>Thus far I have given you a true and Real Di&s;cription of the Province of <HI>Darian,</HI> both as to the People and their Cu&s;toms and Ceremonies; as al&s;o the nature of the Soil, with the Production thereof: If that it be kindly accep|ted, I &s;hall give you a Map of the whole Province with all the Rivers and Villages, with a fuller Di&s;cription than a|ny extant.</P>
<P>I would have put furth a Map of <HI>Darian</HI> with it's ad|jacent Places; but knowing that there are many who will not under&s;tand a Map, that can under&s;tand a Printed De&s;|cription, e&s;pecially of the Province where now <HI>New-Edin|burgh</HI> is &s;tated in <HI>Cal donia.</HI></P>
<P>But knowing that &s;ome People are like Children, who love to play with bony Pictures; they &s;hal be plea&s;ed within a &s;mall time with a Map containing all the varities of the Place, the &s;hapes of Men and Women, Bea&s;ts and Birds, Fruits and Trees.</P>
