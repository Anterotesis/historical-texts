<HEAD>A GREAT VICTORY obtained by Sir <HI>William Bruertons</HI> For|ces, again&s;t the We&s;tmerland Forces, at <HI>Malpe&s;&s;e</HI> in <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> Augu&s;t 26. 1644.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT hath plea&s;ed God to give us a fur|ther victorie again&s;t the Enemie, by a &s;mall handfull of Sir <HI>William Bruertons</HI> Forces; On Saterday la&s;t, being the 24. of Augu&s;t, 1644. there came a Trumpeter from the Enemie hither to <HI>Nantwich,</HI> Sir <HI>William Bruerton</HI> being then here in the Town: which Trumpeter coming to our Court of guard, and there it being demanded of him whither he went, and from whence he came: told the Of|ficer that he came from Prince <HI>Ruperts</HI> Forces, and had been Trumpeter to him, and was come to &s;ubmit to the Parliament; and had a bu&s;ine&s;&s;e of con&s;equence to declare to the Governor; and accordingly he was brought to Sir <HI>William Bruerton.</HI></P>
<P>And he declared unto Sir <HI>William Bruerton,</HI> that a party of the We&s;tmerland forces were marched with Collonel <HI>Baynes,</HI> Collonel <HI>Conniers,</HI> Sir <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> the Princes Troop, and others, towards Che&s;ter by Malpe&s;&s;e, about 1000 men in all, to joyn with Prince <HI>Puperts</HI> forces there; whereupon Sir <HI>William Bruerton</HI> &s;ent out Scouts, and entertained this Trumpeter, and as you &s;hall under|&s;tond found this Relation true.</P>
<PB REF="3">
<P>So Sir <HI>William Brue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="MURP" EXTENT="1 letter">ron</HI> called a Councell of Warre to con&s;ider upon this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e, and it was agreed, that what hor&s;e and foot could be drawn forth, &s;hould pre|&s;ently be &s;ent towards the Enemie; for the mo&s;t of the hor&s;e were at that pre&s;ent out upon another de&s;igne: and accordingly 8 Troops of Hor&s;e, and 7 Colours of Foot Companies were drawn out on Sonday the 25 of Aug. at night, and the Hor&s;e carried each of them a Musketeir behind them, and marched towards Malpe&s;&s;e: and on Monday morning at break of day, when they came with in 2. miles of Malpe&s;&s;e or thereabout, our foot alighted, and our Hor&s;e drew them&s;elves into a bodie, and march|ed in batalia before the Foot.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Enemie having intelligence here|of, &s;ent out a forlorn-hope: but our Hor&s;e wheeling a|bout, appeared not on that &s;ide of the Town which they expected; who di&s;covering them, endeavoured to get be|tween the town and them, which they did: and falling upon them, killed, and took them all, and had their arms and pillage.</P>
<P>Then our hor&s;e gave them an Alarm in the Town: whereupon the Enemie i&s;&s;ued out, and marched again&s;t ours. Then Lieutenant Collonel <HI>Iones,</HI> and Captain <HI>Zan|chy</HI> led on Sir <HI>William Bruertons</HI> own Troops upon the forlorn hope, who charged the Enemie gallantly, and with great courage drew on the re&s;t. The Enemie came upon them fir&s;t with 2. or 3. Charges, and indeed fought furiou&s;ly; &amp; Sir <HI>Williams</HI> hor&s;e made good their ground in de&s;pight of the Enemie. In which Collonel <HI>Iones</HI> was &s;o valiant, that he was &s;hot in the thigh, and his hor&s;e &s;hot under him, and had like to have been taken, but that <HI>George Parker,</HI> &s;ervant to Sir <HI>William Bruerton</HI> did valiant|ly fetch him off; and Captain <HI>Zanchy</HI> had his hor&s;e &s;hot under him: the Enemies lo&s;&s;e we beleeve was great.</P>
<PB REF="3">
<P>Then the Enemy &s;ent out a party to ambuskado the hedges, on both &s;ides the forlorne hope: which being di&s;covered, Captaine <HI>Zanchy</HI> all this while making good a Lane, which hee held very advantageous, did hereupon leave the lane and made way for the re&s;t of our Forces to march up in a full body&punc;</P>
<P>Then the Enemy appeared in 5 &s;everall Brigads, who being ex|treamly vext that they had bin &s;o baffled with &s;uch a &s;mall party, their Command marched up again&s;t us with a great deale of fiercene&s;&s;e, but few of them returned backe againe; for we kil|led, tooke, and totally routed them, as you may &s;ee by this inclo|&s;ed li&s;t which I hrve &s;ent you of the particulars thereof, we have taken Pri&s;oners Serjeant Major <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who Commanded as Maior the Duke of <HI>Yorkes</HI> Regiment of Hor&s;e, and al&s;o Serieant Maior <HI>Maxie</HI> of Sir <HI>Charles Lucas</HI> his Regiment, we have al&s;o taken Serieant Maior <HI>Crathorne</HI> of Collonel <HI>Ferhars</HI> Regiment, and Captain <HI>Thomas Clavering</HI> brother to Coll: <HI>Clavering</HI> of the North, who is dead at <HI>Kendall,</HI> Captain <HI>Barker,</HI> Lieutenant <HI>Mountain,</HI> and other Officers be&s;ides about 20 other Pri&s;oners, and two of the Maiors, and Lieutenant <HI>Mountain,</HI> are wounded, Collonel <HI>Baines</HI> and Coll: <HI>Conyers</HI> are both &s;laine, and al&s;o Ser|jeant Maior <HI>Heskey,</HI> and one of their Lieutenant Collonels, and &s;ome 40 Gentlemen and other under Officers, and betweene 30 or 40 common Souldiers; and we heare by one that is come from <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> that one Serieant Maior that was &s;laine is brought to <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> to be buried, &amp; that Sir <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> is there wounded with a &s;hot in the back very dangerou&s;ly, and al&s;o that Captain <HI>Harris</HI> is brought thither wounded, and divers others; and we heare that there are two other Serjant Majors of theirs flame, but that I cannot affirme, we have taken many Armes that were &s;cattered up and down by the Enemy, and gained all the pillage in the field, to God be the prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>VVilliam Brereton</HI> had provided us more hor&s;e if we had had need which came up that very night, but God be thanked we had no need of them, for God was plea&s;ed to give us this happy Victory before they came up to us.</P>
<PB REF="4">
<P>Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> wee heare is gone over the Forre&s;t of <HI>Deane,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Bri&s;toll,</HI> where no doubt Sir <HI>Iohn Winter</HI> will doe him the be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance he can, and we heare that 2000 <HI>Welch</HI> are following of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> but of the&s;e the&s;e things we &s;hall heare more hereafter. In the meane time I cannot omit to declare the valour not onely of Lieutenant Collonel <HI>Iones</HI> and Captaine <HI>Zanchy</HI> as be|fore, but al&s;o how Captaine <HI>Church,</HI> and Captain <HI>Finch,</HI> behaved them&s;elves very gallantly in this Fight, and in|deed generally all our Forces to God be the prai&s;e who &s;o ble&s;&s;ed them, that with the &s;aid 8. Troopes of Hor&s;e, and 7 Companies of Foot, did kill, take, and rout 1000 of the Enemies, and they had a good mind to have fol|lowed them, but that it was too dangerous an attempt with &s;o few Hor&s;e to &s;traggle from our Foot, who in this bu&s;ine&s;&s;e did very good &s;ervice, in all this we had but one &s;laine, and the Enemy took not one Pr&s;oner of our men.</P>
<P>We heare that Sir <HI>Iohn Meldrum</HI> &s;till proves Victori|ous in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and hath againe taken 140 hor&s;e and their riders; and that <HI>Liver-poole</HI> is now clo&s;ely be&s;eid|ged, and the Town being &s;ummoned, the <HI>Lanco&s;hire</HI> for|ces before it had a very great expectation that it would be pre&s;ently &s;urrendred, but it fell out otherwi&s;e, for the Malignants of the Town, with the Governour and Officers per&s;waded the people to beleeve that there were 2. Ships with &s;ouldiers from <HI>Ireland</HI> comming thither, who would certainly be there in few days to &s;trengthen the Town, and &s;o for pre&s;ent they &s;tand out, but are clo&s;ely be&s;eiged; and it is hoped will be forced in &s;hort time to yeeld. Sir <HI>William Brereton,</HI> our Generall his care in this and all o|ther bu&s;ine&s;&s;e is exceedingg great, and with good di&s;creti|on and judgement. He is to to call a Councell of Warre, and you will &s;hortly heare further, if god be plea&s;ed to
<PB REF="4">ble&s;&s;e us, as he hath done wonderfully already, even above our expectation, to him be the prai&s;e.</P>
