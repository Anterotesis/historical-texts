<P>_WHEN first His Maje&s;ty King <HI>CHARLES</HI> the Second, was plea&s;ed to make Choice of me for Sur|veying the Sea-Coa&s;t, I then, as in Duty bound (be|ing a younger Brother) did acquaint you with it, and most humbly laid the Propo&s;als before you; whereupon you were plea&s;ed not only to approve of them, but did mo&s;t bountifully Advance towards the Charge of the WORK, which be|ing now fini&s;hed, with all Submi&s;&s;ion and Gratitude, I a&s;&s;ume the boldne&s;s to pre&s;ent the&s;e Effects of my Seven Years Indu&s;try to your Protection and Patronage.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE TO THE READER. <HI>To my Fellow Mariners of</HI> GREAT BRITAIN.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HIS mo&s;t Excellent Maje&s;ty King <HI>CHARLES</HI> the Second, who was a great Lover of the Noble Art of NAVIGATION, finding that there were no Sea-Charts or Maps of the&s;e Kingdoms but what were <HI>Dutch,</HI> and Copies from them, and tho&s;e very erroneous, his Maje&s;ty out of his great Zeal for the better Improvement of Navigation, was pleas'd in the Year 1681. to give me the Command of a Yatch for the making this Survey; in which Service I &s;pent Seven years time.</P>
<P>The Intent of this Survey is only to give Directions to Mariners to Sail along&s;t the Coa&s;t of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and how to carry a Ship into any Harbour, River, Port, Road, Bay, or Creek with &s;afety, and how to avoid all Dangers known.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happens, and that too frequently, that when Ships which have made long and dangerous Voyages, and are come home richly Laden, have been &s;hipwrack't on their Native Coa&s;t, whereby both Merchants, Owners and Ma|riners have been impoveri&s;h't. All our Neighbours will acknowledge that no Nation abounds more with skilful and experienced Seamen than our own, none meeting a Danger with more Courage or Bravery; none taking more Care, or u&s;e more Circum&s;pection to prevent it, or are more laborious to overcome it: But we cannot expect that the Ma&s;ter and Mates of every Ship &s;hould be acquainted with all the Coa&s;ts and Harbours of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> into which they may be accidentally obliged to Enter. Sometimes it happens, that in long Voyages the Ma&s;ter and the mo&s;t knowing Men die, and the Ship is brought into &s;ight of Land by tho&s;e who have skill enough to conduct the Ship at Sea, but are wholly un|acquainted
<PB REF="8"> with the Coa&s;ts and Harbours, or having but lit|tle Knowledge, dare not tru&s;t to it; in &s;uch Ca&s;es, and to &s;uch Per&s;ons, this Survey will &s;erve in the room of a Pilot.</P>
<P>As many Ships are lo&s;t by Ignorance and Negligence, as by &s;tre&s;s of Weather, &s;o a Ma&s;ter of a Ship hath a very great Charge, and ought to be a &s;ober Man, as well as a skilful Ma|riner: All helps of Art, Care, and Circum&s;pection are to be u&s;ed by him, that the Lives of Mariners (the mo&s;t u&s;eful of their Maje&s;ties Subjects at this Juncture) and the For|tunes of hone&s;t Merchants under his Care, may be pre&s;er|ved. To &s;upply the Defects of which, I have been Employed by their Maje&s;ties Predece&s;&s;ors, and Encouraged by Inge|nious and Noble Benefactors; and as I have hitherto made it my Bu&s;ine&s;s to make tho&s;e true Figures of our Coa&s;ts and Harbours &s;o to &s;erve my Country, I &s;hall not be wanting to give them &s;uch Additions and Amendments as I &s;hall find hereafter needful: Wi&s;hing you always happy and &s;ucce&s;sful Voyages, and &s;afe Returns, with Pro&s;perity to the Nation and its Forces by Sea and Land, that as we have been hitherto, &s;o we may even be at home Soveraigns of the Seas, and Umpiers of the Differences betwixt our Neighbours abroad, which as it is every good man's Wi&s;h, &s;o is it the con&s;tant hearty Prayer of</P>

But where you find a Line drawn between two Figures, as in the Margent, which is u&s;ed no where but at &s;uch places as there is not three Fathom at Low-water. As for Example; At the going into <HI>Rye,</HI> as you may &s;ee in the Chart, Number 8. there on the Bar you find the Figure 4 above the Line, which &s;heweth that there is four Fathom at High-water: Then under the Line there is the figure 1, which &s;heweth that there is but one Fathom at Low-water on a Spring Tide.</ITEM>

<P>To the we&s;tward of <HI>Dunginne&s;s</HI> lieth <HI>Rye</HI> Harbour; it is a Bar-place, but the water ri&s;eth three and four Fathom. On the ea&s;t &s;ide, going in, there are two white Beacons on the Beach, which you keep together till you bring the Leadings Marks together, then run in. When you are in the Harbour you will have no le&s;s than fifteen and &s;ixteen foot at Low-water, as you may &s;ee in the Chart, Number 8. where the going in is &s;o plainly demon&s;trated, that you need have no other Directions.

<HEAD>Cuckmore Haven.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Cuckmore Haven</HI> lieth four miles to the we&s;tward of <HI>Beachy-Head,</HI> and is a Bar Har|bour, not having above &s;ix foot at Low-water, and thirteen and fourteen at High-water.

<P>The <HI>Owers</HI> lye &s;outh &s;outh ea&s;t from <HI>Chi|che&s;ter</HI> Spire, and four Leagues from the &s;hoar, and about four long Leagues or five Leagues ea&s;t from <HI>Bendridge</HI> Point on the <HI>I&s;le of Wight;</HI> there length is north ea&s;t and &s;outh we&s;t, about three Leagues, and about three miles broad in the middle, and narrow at each end, and dry at Low-water. There lieth another &s;hoal on the in&s;ide of this, the north end of it dries at Low-water: Be|tween which and the &s;hoar is another Shoal lying in length as the <HI>Owers</HI> do, called the <HI>Mixens,</HI> and lieth from <HI>Sel&s;ey</HI> Point about two miles &s;outh. There is a Channel between the <HI>Owers</HI> and the <HI>Mixens,</HI> but it being of no u&s;e but to tho&s;e that are very well ac|quainted, I will not give any Directions to Sail through them, nor within them. There lye &s;ome other Banks within them, which I forbear to &s;peak of them. The only and chief end of my bu&s;ine&s;s is to give good Directions how to avoid the&s;e &s;hoals, that have proved &s;o fatal to many Ships. There are very good Marks to avoid them, if you keep <HI>Dunno&s;e</HI> we&s;t, you run a good brith without them; there is twelve Fathom wa|ter clo&s;e to them; keep in eighteen Fathom and you will not be in any danger of them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">How Ships are lo&s;t on the <HI>Ow|ers.</HI></NOTE> The great rea&s;on why &s;o many Ships have fallen in on the&s;e Shoals, is the great In|draught of the Tide &s;etting &s;trong into St. <HI>Helens</HI> eight hours or more; the latter part of the Flood &s;ets into St. <HI>Helens.</HI> My ad|vice is, That when you are near this place in the night time, or thick weather, to be very careful, and keep your Lead well: In little Wind or Calms you &s;hall be drawn in here to admiration, by the &s;trong In|draught, which if you find, Anchor in time.</P>

The next Con&s;ideration is your Depth of Wa|ter, with the colour and quality of the Ground.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Colour and Qua|lity of the Ground.</NOTE> But as for the colour and quality of the Ground, I think it very uncertain, as I found by Experience lying becalm'd in the Soundings, when I very often heav'd the Lead, and did find one ca&s;t &s;o different from another in quality, and &s;till in the &s;ame depth of water, that I would not have any to tru&s;t to it; only this is generally ob&s;er|ved, That the Ground to the &s;outhward on the <HI>French</HI> Coa&s;t is more gruffer, that is, the Sand is bigger or more gravelly, bigger &s;hells and more variety, with a &s;ort of &s;harp &s;mall things called Needles. We&s;t &s;outh we&s;t from <HI>&V;&s;hant</HI> eight or ten Leagues, you will have &s;eventy four and &s;eventy five Fa|thom water, and four and five Leagues we&s;t from <HI>&V;&s;hant</HI> &s;ixty eight and &s;eventy Fa|thom, we&s;t north we&s;t from <HI>&V;&s;hant</HI> eight or ten Leagues you will have &s;eventy and &s;e|venty one Fathom, and four, five, or &s;ix Leagues of &s;ixty &s;ix and &s;ixty five Fathom.</P>
<P>North we&s;t from <HI>&V;&s;hant</HI> eight or ten Leagues &s;eventy Fathom, and five Leagues north we&s;t &s;ixty four and &s;ixty five Fathom; North north we&s;t from <HI>&V;&s;hant</HI> about &s;even, eight, or ten Leagues, from &s;ixty five to &s;ixty eight Fathom, and four Leagues north north we&s;t &s;ixty Fathom. North from <HI>&V;|&s;hant</HI> eight or ten Leagues, &s;ixty four and &s;ixty five; and from three Leagues to five Leagues north you will have &s;ixty Fathom. In the&s;e Depths, Bearings, and Di&s;tances the Ground is white things like <HI>Hakes-teeth,</HI> and the Ground ruffer then on the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Coa&s;t. But, as I &s;aid before, that the quality of the Ground being &s;o uncertain, I would not have any Per&s;ons to give any tru&s;t to it.</P>
<P>But on the Coa&s;t of <HI>England</HI> the Ground is finer in general; for five, &s;ix, and &s;even Leagues to the &s;outhward of <HI>Scilly,</HI> you will have from fifty to &s;ixty Fathom water fine white Sand, with &s;ome red and black among&s;t it, and &s;ome times &s;ome &s;mall &s;hells or pieces of &s;hells, and at other times white Sand only.</P>

<P>But if you are to the northward of <HI>Scilly</HI> then your Ground will be white Sand, and ow&s;ey Sand: when the I&s;lands of <HI>Scilly</HI> bear &s;outh about five or &s;ix Leagues, you will have fifty three to fifty &s;even Fathom wa|ter.
